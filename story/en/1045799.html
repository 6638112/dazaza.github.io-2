But, as the world continues to battle a deadly pandemic, these big-data surveillance systems are playing an increasingly suspicious role in our daily lives.</p><p>这是安妮·雅各布森（Annie Jacobsen）所著的《第一排》一书的节选，内容是美国国防部寻求建立世界上最强大的生物识别数据库：一种可以标记，跟踪和定位战区可疑恐怖分子的系统。但是，随着世界继续与致命的大流行作斗争，这些大数据监视系统在我们的日常生活中扮演着越来越可疑的角色。</p><p> In a steel container inside an American outpost in southern Afghanistan, an aerostat operator named Kevin was watching a man defecate in a farmer’s field. The man was wearing a purple hat. It was 2012, and Kevin was serving as mission director for the Persistent Ground Surveillance System team stationed here at Combat Outpost Siah Choy, located in the heart of volatile Zhari District.</p><p> 在阿富汗南部一个美国前哨基地内的一个钢制集装箱中，一位名叫凯文（Kevin）的浮空器操作员看着一名男子在农民的田地里排便。那人戴着一顶紫色的帽子。那是2012年，凯文（Kevin）担任了持久地面监视系统团队的任务主管，该团队驻扎在动荡的扎里区中心地带的战斗前哨基地Siah Choy。</p><p> The PGSS (pronounced  pee-jiss) team spent 24 hours a day, seven days a week, watching an area that included 20 or so small Afghan villages. Their job was twofold. On the one hand, they watched four individual platoons of American soldiers who’d been deployed to this area, including the approximately 30 young men who made up First Platoon. Whenever one of these platoons stepped off base to conduct a patrol, the PGSS team “covered down” on the soldiers, keeping an eye out for indicators of a pending attack. The rest of the time, the team observed locals under suspicion of terrorist activity, which is why Kevin was watching the man in the purple hat. The question at hand: Was he squatting down to go to the bathroom, or to bury an IED?</p><p> PGSS（发音为pee-jiss）小组每周7天，一天24小时不间断地观察着一个地区，该地区包括大约20个阿富汗小村庄。他们的工作是双重的。一方面，他们观看了部署在该地区的四个美国士兵排，其中包括约30名组成“第一排”的年轻人。每当这些排中的一个离开基地进行巡逻时，PGSS团队就会“掩护”士兵，随时留意即将发生的袭击的迹象。在其余时间中，团队观察到当地人怀疑有恐怖活动，这就是为什么凯文看着那个戴着紫色帽子的人的原因。眼前的问题：他是蹲下来去洗手间还是掩埋IED？</p><p>  An aerostat is a giant surveillance balloon. Its onboard cameras and sensors suck up vast amounts of data on what’s happening on the ground. That raw data gets processed, organized, and aggregated into an army intelligence product thanks to software developed by Palantir Technologies. Launched almost two decades ago with seed money from the CIA, the Silicon Valley startup had managed to solve a problem plaguing the Pentagon: After years of accumulating surveillance video captured by drones, airships, and aircraft flying over Iraq, the armed forces had, quite literally, millions of hours of footage sitting in archives taking up space. “We’re going to find ourselves in the not too distant future swimming in sensors and drowning in data,” Lieutenant General David Deptula warned colleagues in 2009. In one single year, the Air Force alone had collected more video footage in Iraq than a person could watch 24 hours a day, seven days a week, over the course of 24 continuous years. What to do with all that information? Palantir’s software could sift through volumes of raw, or unstructured, data, then organize and structure it in a way that made search and discovery features possible. Search for, and discovery of, say, a man in a purple hat.</p><p>  浮空器是一个巨大的监视气球。它的机载摄像头和传感器可以吸收地面上发生的大量数据。多亏了Palantir Technologies开发的软件，原始数据才能得到处理，组织和汇总为军队情报产品。这家硅谷的初创公司是在二十多年前以来自中央情报局的种子资金创立的，它成功地解决了困扰五角大楼的问题：经过多年积累的无人机，飞艇和飞机在伊拉克上空捕获的监视视频后，武装部队已经从字面上看，数百万小时的素材在档案中占用空间。 David Deptula中将在2009年警告同事们说：“我们将在不久的将来游泳在传感器中，淹没在数据中。”在一年中，仅在空军，伊拉克就收集了比在连续24年的时间里，一个人每周7天，一天24小时都可以看电视。如何处理所有这些信息？ Palantir的软件可以筛选大量原始或非结构化数据，然后以使搜索和发现功能成为可能的方式对其进行组织和结构化。搜索并发现一个戴着紫色帽子的男子。</p><p>  “I could see everything,” Kevin says, referring to the aerostat’s technology-enabled omniscience, sometimes called the God’s-eye view. “The only way I didn’t see something was if I wasn’t looking at it.”</p><p>  凯文（Kevin）指的是浮空器基于技术的全知，有时也称为“上帝之眼”，他说：“我什么都可以看到。” “我看不到东西的唯一方法是不看东西。”</p><p>  Kevin is an expert in what’s called pattern-of-life analysis, an esoteric discipline that involves establishing a person’s identity based on his or her cumulative habits, much of which is captured from overhead surveillance. The man going to the bathroom was deemed a person of interest, and Kevin was working to establish his pattern of life in pursuit of a new methodology called activity-based intelligence, or ABI. The first, fundamental premise of activity-based intelligence:  You are what you do.</p><p>  凯文（Kevin）是所谓的生活模式分析领域的专家，这是一门深奥的学科，涉及根据一个人或她的累积习惯来建立一个人的身份，其中大部分是从日常监控中捕获的。上厕所的人被认为是有兴趣的人，而凯文（Kevin）正在努力建立自己的生活模式，以追求一种称为基于活动的情报或ABI的新方法。基于活动的智力的第一个基本前提：您就是您的工作。</p><p>  The PGSS aerostat that Kevin was in charge of was a 72-foot-long balloon called a 22M (for meters) in contractor parlance. It was not a dirigible, meaning it was not steerable and did not navigate through the air on its own power. The 22M was tethered to a mooring station inside the combat outpost at Siah Choy, attached by a 2,700-foot cable made of fiber optics, rubber, and Kevlar wrap. The flatbed surface on the mooring station reminded Kevin of a merry‑go‑round because it could rotate 360 degrees. “It could swivel back and forth to allow for wind relief, [which] mattered in the summer months, when the 120 Days of Wind kicked in,” he said, referring to Afghanistan’s strong seasonal winds. (He would later say they reminded him of the Santa Anas in Southern California, where he grew up.)</p><p>  凯文（Kevin）负责的PGSS浮空器是一个72英尺长的气球，承包商称其为22M（米）。它不是飞船，这意味着它无法操纵，也无法依靠自己的力量在空中航行。 22M被拴在Siah Choy战斗哨所内的停泊站，并由一条2700英尺长的光纤，橡胶和凯夫拉尔包裹制成的电缆连接。系泊站上的平板表面使凯文想起了旋转木马，因为它可以旋转360度。他说：“它可以来回旋转以减轻风的影响，这在夏季非常重要，当“ 120天风”开始时，”他指的是阿富汗的季节性强风。 （他稍后会说，他们使他想起了他长大的南加州的圣塔阿纳斯。） </p><p>  The equipment attached to the balloon afforded Kevin a clear view of the soldiers, their outpost, called Strong Point Payenzai, and its environs. For the most part, First Platoon’s soldiers were unaware that an aerostat with a suite of electro-optical-infrared high-definition sensors and cameras was able to watch them as they walked around their area of operations—through grape rows, down footpaths, and into the villages on their twice-daily patrols.</p><p>气球上的设备使凯文清楚地看到了士兵，他们的哨所（称为强点派恩扎伊）及其周围地区。在大多数情况下，第一排的士兵都不知道有一个带有一组电光红外高清传感器和摄像头的浮空器可以在行走过程中观察它们，穿过葡萄行，人行道和每天两次巡逻到村庄。</p><p> “The idea was, do not let anyone know we exist,” Kevin says. “Occasionally one of the Joes”—contractor vernacular for soldiers—“an NCO usually, would use us as a way of saying ‘We are watching you.’ And we’d say, ‘No, no, no, don’t do that.’ We’d end up with some villager at our combat outpost saying, ‘I know you’re watching us. Tell me who stole my goat.’ This actually happened.”</p><p> “想法是，不要让任何人知道我们的存在，”凯文说。 “偶尔有一个乔斯”（士兵的承包商）“一个NCO通常会用我们作为说'我们在看着你'的方式。我们会说'不，不，不，不要做那我们最终在战斗哨所遇到一个村民说：“我知道你在看着我们。告诉我谁偷了我的山羊。’这实际上发生了。”</p><p> The imaging system, dubbed the MX-15, attached to the underbelly of the aerostat was roughly the size of a beach ball. It weighed 100 pounds and carried an array of cameras for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance purposes. Its ability to see people and objects on the ground was extraordinary; it could make out an unusual modification on the buttstock of an AK-47 from 2 miles away, Kevin recalls. This image feed was livestreamed to several 40-inch monitors inside the steel container where the PGSS team worked. Separately, the data went to Palantir’s database for processing.</p><p> 附着在浮空器底部上的成像系统被称为MX-15，大约相当于沙滩球的大小。它重达100磅，并装有一系列用于情报，监视和侦察目的的相机。它在地面上看到人和物体的能力非常出色；凯文回忆说，这可能会对2英里外的AK-47枪托进行不寻常的改动。该图像提要被实时传输到PGSS小组工作的钢制容器内的几台40英寸监视器上。另外，数据进入了Palantir的数据库进行处理。</p><p> Working as a pattern-of-life expert at Sia Choy, Kevin spent hours a day, seven days a week watching all kinds of people go about their lives, with the goal of separating out the insurgents from the civilians. Pattern-of-life analysis means watching seemingly innocent behavior hour after hour, eyes focused for when the behavior of a person of interest might take a unique turn. Machines can’t yet perform this function; only humans have conscious reasoning.</p><p> 凯文（Kevin）在新航（Sia Choy）担任生活模式专家，他一周七天每天花几个小时观察各种人的生活，目的是将叛乱分子与平民隔离。生活模式分析意味着每小时都在看似无辜的行为，目光聚焦在感兴趣的人的行为可能发生独特转变的时候。机器尚无法执行此功能；只有人类有意识的推理。</p><p> The PGSS team had reason to believe the person of interest in the purple hat was a terrorist. Because purple was an uncommon color for a hat in Zhari District, it had become a unique marker for the man. After watching him for weeks, they’d determined he was a bomb emplacer, meaning he buried IEDs for the Taliban. The team had established his bed-down location: He lived across the Arghandab River, on the south side. Like many of the people Kevin and his team tracked, this individual insurgent was still an anonymous person to them.</p><p> PGSS小组有理由相信对紫色帽子感兴趣的人是恐怖分子。由于紫色是扎里区一顶帽子的罕见颜色，因此紫色已成为该男子的独特标记。在观察他几个星期后，他们确定他是炸弹袭击者，这意味着他为塔利班埋葬了简易爆炸装置。团队确定了他的卧床位置：他住在南侧的Arghandab河上。就像凯文和他的团队追踪的许多人一样，这个叛乱分子对他们仍然是一个匿名者。</p><p> “He would get up every morning, turn on an IED belt, a series of IEDs strung together by det [detonation] cord, to protect himself and his perimeter,” Kevin recalls. “We elevated him to 429 status through his actions.”</p><p> 凯文回忆说：“他每天早晨起床，打开简易爆炸装置安全带，用爆破绳将一系列简易爆炸装置串在一起，以保护自己和他的周围。” “我们通过他的行动将他提升到429位。”</p><p> 429 status is what happens when a person of interest completes three “interactions with the ground.” These are actions that allow for that individual to be moved out of civilian status and into insurgent status—to be targeted and killed legally according to army rules of engagement.</p><p> 429状态是当感兴趣的人完成三个“与地面的互动”时发生的情况。这些行动可以使该人脱离平民身份，进入叛乱状态，并根据军队交战规则合法地定为目标并予以杀害。 </p><p>  The three interactions with the ground were specific: “If I see him interacting with the ground, and then I see the pressure tank going in, or [if ] I see the charge going in, and him stringing the lamp cord out to install his pressure plate or his battery connection … That’s one, two, and three for me,” Kevin says. This is activity-based intelligence acquired through persistent surveillance from above.</p><p>与地面的三种相互作用是特定的：“如果我看到他与地面相互作用，然后看到压力罐进入，或者[如果]我看到电荷进入，并且他将灯线拉出以安装他的压板或他的电池连接…对我来说分别是一，二和三，”凯文说。这是通过从上方进行持续监视获得的基于活动的情报。</p><p> But activity-based intelligence as a methodology is predicated on a more radical idea. “By understanding [a person’s] pattern of life, analysts can build models of potential outcomes and anticipate  what may happen,” explains Patrick Biltgen, a senior mission engineer who worked on the persistent surveillance system ARGUS‐IS (shorthand for Autonomous Real-Time Ground Ubiquitous Surveillance Imaging System), glorified by some for its mind-blowing technological achievements and criticized by others as paving the way for an all-seeing, digital panopticon.</p><p> 但是基于活动的情报作为一种方法论是基于一个更激进的想法。 “通过了解[人的]生活模式，分析人员可以建立潜在结果的模型并预测可能发生的情况，”致力于持久监视系统ARGUS-IS（自动实时的简写）的高级任务工程师Patrick Biltgen解释说。地面无处不在的监视成像系统，因其惊人的技术成就而受到称赞，而另一些人则批评称其为全视之道的数字全景优化铺平了道路。</p><p>  Activity-based intelligence began in the war theater with the presumption  You are what you do, but it is now being pushed into a new realm, says Biltgen. One that asserts:  Because we know what you did, we think we know what you are going to do next. “Just like [the film]  Minority Report predicted in 2002.” Today, some of these same methodologies are being used by the US federal government, including the Department of Health and Human Services, to tag, track and locate people who might carry the coronavirus. This raises concerns among legal scholars of a burgeoning biometric cybersurveillance state.</p><p>  比尔特根说，基于活动的情报始于战争剧院，其前提是您所做的事，但现在正被推向一个新领域。有人断言：因为我们知道您做了什么，所以我们认为我们知道您接下来要做什么。 “就像（电影）《少数派报告》在2002年预测的那样。”如今，美国联邦政府（包括卫生和公共服务部）正在使用某些相同的方法来标记，跟踪和定位可能携带冠状病毒的人员。这引起了新兴的生物识别网络监视国家的法律学者的关注。</p><p> In Afghanistan in 2012, when not covering down on a specific mission, the PGSS team at Combat Outpost Siah Choy would watch persons of interest like the man in the purple hat. Waiting for three key interactions with the earth that would allow for 429 status to be assigned to the person of interest. As soon as the criteria were met, the PGSS team would notify the army’s S2 intelligence officer, a lower-echelon intelligence officer working in the tactical operations center, but with profound, direct influence over what might happen next. The S2 would monitor the situation by watching the full-motion video feed. At the same time, one of the aerostat’s flight engineers would begin reviewing the feed from minutes before.</p><p> 在2012年的阿富汗，当没有执行特定任务时，战斗前哨基地Siah Choy的PGSS团队会监视感兴趣的人，例如戴着紫色帽子的男人。等待与地球的三个关键交互，这将使429个状态分配给感兴趣的人。符合标准后，PGSS小组会立即通知陆军的S2情报官，这是一名在战术作战中心工作的低级情报官，但对接下来可能发生的事情产生深远而直接的影响。 S2将通过观看全动态视频提要来监视情况。同时，一位浮空器的飞行工程师将从几分钟前开始审核提要。</p><p> “Rolling it back in time,” Kevin explains, “in order to take snapshots of the three interaction-with-the-earth events.”</p><p> 凯文（Kevin）解释说：“将时间追溯到过去，以便对三个与地球互动事件进行快照。”</p><p> The 429 package, which allows an insurgent to be killed in an air strike, must meet the legal requirements. The full-motion video gets snapshotted as evidence. While this is going on, the PGSS operator quickly generates a PowerPoint containing all the data, which goes to the S2. The S2 quickly reviews that, then sends the information to the battle captain.</p><p> 允许一名叛乱分子在空袭中丧生的429配套必须符合法律要求。全动态视频将作为快照快照。在此过程中，PGSS操作员会快速生成一个包含所有数据的PowerPoint，并将其发送到S2。 S2迅速对此进行审查，然后将信息发送给战斗队长。</p><p> “He takes that info,” Kevin explains, “and he washes it through Palantir.” Although Kevin carries a top secret clearance, as a PGSS operator he would not be able to access Palantir’s database. “That’s an S2 function,” he explains, meaning the classified data being aggregated by Palantir is proprietary. The job of a pattern-of-life expert is to find out “who is who” and “who is doing what.” As defense contractors, PGSS operators do not have the legal authority to decide who gets to kill whom.</p><p> “他掌握了这些信息，”凯文解释说，“然后他通过Palantir对其进行了清洗。”尽管Kevin拥有最高机密许可，但作为PGSS运营商，他将无法访问Palantir的数据库。他解释说：“这是S2功能。”这意味着由Palantir汇总的机密数据是专有数据。生活方式专家的工作是找出“谁是谁”和“谁在做什么”。作为国防承包商，PGSS运营商无权决定谁杀了谁。 </p><p> “The military application of Palantir is awesome,” Kevin says. Palantir is capable of mining and aggregating data on individual people in a manner that would astonish almost anyone. But he thinks the growing movement among law enforcement agencies in the United States to use Palantir’s software programs domestically is cause for alarm. For example, in 2017, a joint effort by the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Health and Human Services relied on Palantir Technologies to tag, track, locate, and arrest 400 people in an operation targeting family members and caregivers of unaccompanied migrant children. Human rights organizations and privacy advocates cried foul.</p><p>凯文说：“ Palantir在军事上的应用真棒。” Palantir能够以几乎使任何人惊讶的方式来挖掘和汇总有关个人的数据。但他认为，美国执法机构之间越来越多的在国内使用Palantir的软件程序的动向引起了警觉。例如，2017年，美国国土安全部，移民和海关执法部以及卫生与公共服务部共同努力，借助Palantir Technologies的行动来标记，追踪，定位和逮捕400人，目标人群是家属和照顾者。无人陪伴的流动儿童。人权组织和隐私倡导者大声疾呼。</p><p>  “The fact that there’s other moves afoot to actually use Palantir in the United States, I think that’s very, very bad, because of the type of 360 [degree] metrics that are collected,” Kevin warns. “I’m not kind of saying, ‘Hey, I’m scared of Big Brother.’ That’s not my view. But that is exactly what Palantir is capable of.”</p><p>  凯文警告说：“事实上，在美国还有其他举动要实际使用Palantir的事实，我认为这非常非常糟糕，因为要收集360度指标。” “我不是在说，‘嘿，我怕老大哥。’那不是我的看法。但这正是Palantir的能力。”</p><p> In Afghanistan in 2012, there was a geospatial intelligence gap as far as biometrics was concerned. PGSS operators were able to physically locate and track individual persons of interest who were still anonymous—meaning they were fighters whose identities were not yet known. These individuals were being watched because of what they did. Separately, the Defense Department maintained its Automated Biometric Identification System, or ABIS, database, which contained the biometric profiles on millions of individuals in Afghanistan, some of whom had already been classified as most-wanted terrorists. Biometrics meaning fingerprints, facial images, iris scans, and DNA—body measurements taken wittingly, by American soldiers on presence patrols, as well as unwittingly, having been lifted off captured bomb parts and weapons caches. In 2012, there was no technology-based way to bridge this gap. Meaning the MX‑15 camera on the aerostat could not cross reference what it saw with biometric information from the ABIS database. On occasion Kevin would participate in a go‑around.</p><p> 就生物识别技术而言，2012年在阿富汗存在地理空间情报差距。 PGSS运营商能够物理定位和跟踪仍匿名的感兴趣个人-这意味着他们是身份不明的战斗机。这些人因为自己的行为而受到关注。国防部单独维护着其自动生物特征识别系统（ABIS）数据库，其中包含阿富汗数百万个人的生物特征档案，其中一些人已经被归类为最想要的恐怖分子。生物特征识别指的是指纹，面部图像，虹膜扫描和DNA-美国士兵在现场巡逻时进行的身体测量，以及在不经意间从被捕获的炸弹零件和武器藏匿处故意进行的测量。在2012年，没有基于技术的方法来弥合这一差距。这意味着浮空器上的MX-15摄像头无法与ABIS数据库中的生物识别信息交叉引用。凯文有时会参加复飞。</p><p>  “I would get a slice of data from Palantir [via S2] saying, ‘Hey this is this guy we’re interested in. The request would be ‘Try and locate him.’” Included in the slice of data from Palantir would be an image of the man’s face. “I’d get a picture of him,” Kevin says, “I’d also get, maybe, one or two degrees of people that he knows, and areas that he’s known to travel in.” When Kevin says “degrees of people,” he means individuals the person of interest is linked to, associates with, or has been determined to know. The power of Palantir lies in the connections it can make between people, searching vast amounts of data, analyzing patterns, and making connections that would take humans a huge amount of time to figure out.</p><p>  “我会从Palantir（通过S2）获得一部分数据，说：'嘿，这是我们感兴趣的这个人。请求将是'尝试并找到他。'” Palantir的这部分数据中包括：男人的脸的图像。凯文说：“我会得到他的照片，也许还会得到他认识的一到两个人，以及他知道要去的地方。”当凯文（Kevin）说“人的程度”时，他是指与该人相关的个人，与之关联的人或已确定要知道的人。 Palantir的强大之处在于它可以在人与人之间建立联系，搜索大量数据，分析模式以及建立联系，而这需要人类花费大量时间才能弄清。</p><p> Because Palantir’s algorithms can gather data about a person’s activities in the past, in 2012, the machines were “learning” how to make predictions about this same person’s activities in the future. In addition to the images of the associates, Kevin would often get predictions about “a general area where [the person] could be traveling.”</p><p> 由于Palantir的算法可以收集有关某人过去的活动的数据，因此在2012年，这些机器正在“学习”如何对同一个人的未来进行预测。除了同事的照片之外，凯文经常会得到关于“ [该人]可能在其中行驶的一般区域”的预测。</p><p> Once the PGSS team located who they thought was the actual person of interest, “we’d kind of do a self-check, to follow him.” Meaning the initial hunt began with a computer, but it was now fact-checked by a human. “This is basically what I do. I follow his bed-down location. I track every building that he walks to. I determine his daily pattern of life. When does he pray? When does he eat? When does he go to the bathroom? When does he wake up? When does he sleep? The data cuts from Palantir are like a bread-crumb trail for me to go down. At the same time, if I see something, then that’s me generating a report. And that becomes data in Palantir.”</p><p> PGSS小组找到他们认为真正感兴趣的人后，“我们会进行自我检查，以跟从他。”这意味着最初的狩猎始于一台计算机，但现在已经由人类进行了事实检查。 “基本上，这就是我要做的。我跟随他的卧铺位置。我追踪他走到的每座建筑物。我确定他的日常生活方式。他什么时候祈祷？他什么时候吃？他什么时候去洗手间？他什么时候醒来？他什么时候睡觉？ Palantir的数据削减就像一条面包屑的小路，让我无法接受。同时，如果我看到什么，那就是我生成报告。这就是Palantir中的数据。”</p><p> Once an individual is determined to be a known IED emplacer, like the man in the purple hat, and he has been designated a “429 package,” then one of two things happens. “If there is an asset available, if CAS,” close air support like attack helicopters and drones “is in the vicinity, then it is time to take the target out.” If there’s not air support available, then the person of interest remains marked for death in the system. “The moment there is a target of opportunity to take him out, I call it in. I don’t have to go back through the approving process,” Kevin says. “The 429 package stands. That’s why it’s called a Target of Opportunity. When you have the opportunity, you strike the target.” You kill the man.</p><p> 一旦确定某人是已知的简易爆炸装置袭击者，如戴着紫色帽子的男子，并被指定为“ 429包裹”，则将发生两件事之一。 “如果有资产可用，如果有CAS，”近空中支援如攻击直升机和无人驾驶飞机“就在附近，那就是将目标撤离的时候了。”如果没有可用的空中支援，则感兴趣的人仍会在系统中标记为死亡。凯文说：“有机会将他带出去的那一刻，我打电话给我。我不必回头进行审批程序。” “ 429包站立。这就是为什么它被称为机会目标。只要有机会，您就可以实现目标。”你杀了那个人。 </p><p> One morning, Kevin came into the ops center. The overnight team was excited. One of them said, “We’re about to kill the man in the purple hat.”</p><p>一天早上，凯文来到了行动中心。通宵的团队很兴奋。其中一位说：“我们将要杀死那个戴着紫色帽子的男人。”</p><p> Kevin had personally watched this man bury IEDs and train others how to emplace bombs. He leaned in close to the screen. “Where is he?” he asked his colleague.</p><p> 凯文亲眼目睹了这个人掩埋简易爆炸装置并训练其他人如何放置炸弹。他俯身靠近屏幕。 “他在哪里？”他问他的同事。</p><p>  The colleague pointed to the screen. “Here,” he said, “talking to this other farmer,” and he pointed to a man seated on a tractor.</p><p>  同事指着屏幕。他说：“在这里，与其他农民交谈。”他指着一个坐在拖拉机上的男人。</p><p> Kevin examined the image feed. The man on the tractor was talking to an old man, who appeared to be another farmer. Kevin stared at the man in the purple hat.</p><p> 凯文检查了图像提要。拖拉机上的那个人正在和一个老人聊天，他似乎是另一个农夫。凯文戴着紫色帽子盯着那个人。</p><p> “That’s a Massey Ferguson tractor he’s sitting on,” Kevin said, pointing at the screen.</p><p> “那是他坐在的梅西·弗格森拖拉机，”凯文指着屏幕说。</p><p>  Kevin explains what went through his mind in 2012. “I’d burned a lot of time and effort trying to locate and kill this guy, because he was a terrorist cell leader. I knew his face. I knew his gait. I knew his build. I knew what he looked like, and I knew he wore a purple hat. I knew he wore white and black man-jams [traditional outfit]. I knew the color of his shawl, his little body wrap, and I knew where he lived.”</p><p>  凯文（Kevin）解释了2012年他的想法。“我花了很多时间和精力来寻找并杀死这个人，因为他是恐怖组织的负责人。我知道他的脸。我知道他的步态。我知道他的身材。我知道他长什么样，也知道他戴着一顶紫色的帽子。我知道他穿着白色和黑色的男式紧身裤（传统服装）。我知道他的披肩的颜色，他的小包裹，而且我知道他的住处。”</p><p>  Standing in the C2 shelter at Siah Choy, in front of the video screens, the colleague spoke, “We’re getting ready to hit him now,” he said. “CAS is on the way.”</p><p>  这位同事站在视频屏幕前Siah Choy的C2收容所里说：“我们现在准备打他，”他说。 “ CAS在路上。” </p><p> “That isn’t him,” Kevin said. “That is absolutely  not him.”</p><p>“不是他，”凯文说。 “那绝对不是他。”</p><p> Kevin was certain of this. “I thought, wow, that looks like him. But something just gave me a tickle that that wasn’t him. For a lot of different reasons. Number one, he’s not a worker. He’s a bad guy. Bad guys don’t tool around on tractors and play farmer. They are bad guys.” The tractor was a legitimate and expensive tractor, one only a farmer would have. “Why is he on a tractor?” Kevin asked himself. “Why is he talking to this old man in this field?”</p><p> 凯文对此很确定。 “我想，哇，看起来像他。但是有些事让我很痒，那不是他。由于许多不同的原因。第一，他不是工人。他是个坏人。坏蛋不会在拖拉机上动手，不会扮演农民。他们是坏人。”拖拉机是一种合法且昂贵的拖拉机，只有农夫才能拥有。 “他为什么在拖拉机上？”凯文问自己。 “他为什么在这个领域和这个老人说话？”</p><p>  The more Kevin looked at the man in the purple hat, the more he realized something was wrong. “I became confused. I said to myself, ‘Well, I mean, fuck, it looks like him, but I don’t think it is him.’”</p><p>  凯文越是看着那个戴着紫色帽子的男人，他越会意识到出了什么问题。 “我感到困惑。我对自己说：“嗯，我的意思是，他妈的，看起来像他，但我不认为是他。”</p><p>  Then he became very stressed out, he recalls. “Hands-down, I wanted the man in the purple hat dead. I still do to this day. But we’re talking about killing someone.” Metaphorically, he says, he had his finger on the button. “If that kills an innocent civilian? I don’t want that.”</p><p>  他回忆说，然后他变得非常紧张。 “放手，我希望那个戴着紫色帽子的男人死了。我至今仍在做。但是我们正在谈论杀死某人。”他说，比喻说，他的手指放在按钮上。 “那会杀死无辜的平民吗？我不要那个。”</p><p> Kevin ran out of the operations center, across the outpost and into the tactical operations center. “I told the S2 they had to call off the air strike. It’s not him,” Kevin told the battle captain.</p><p> 凯文（Kevin）跑出了作战中心，穿过前哨基地进入了战术作战中心。 “我告诉S2他们必须取消空袭。不是他，”凯文告诉战队长。</p><p> The tactical operations center spun into action. One of the S2 intelligence officers confirmed that Brigade Headquarters, located a few miles north at Forward Operating Base Pasab, had already authorized the air strike. That close air support was on the way.</p><p> 战术行动中心开始行动。一名S2情报人员证实，位于北部前进步兵基地Pasab北部几英里的旅总部已经批准了空袭。空中的支援正在路上。</p><p> “I said, ‘I’m certain it’s not him.’” Kevin remembers. The battle captain said to him, “Well, you’ve got five minutes to figure that out and prove me wrong.” Kevin said that’s what he’d do.</p><p> “我说，‘我确定不是他。’”凯文记得。战斗队长对他说：“好吧，您有五分钟的时间来弄清楚这一点并证明我是错的。”凯文说的就是他要做的。 </p><p> Kevin ran back to the C2 shelter. “I [moved] the camera over to his actual bed-down location. He lived right across the river. I waited and waited. It felt like half an hour. It was probably more like a few minutes. Finally he came out. I recognized him right away.”</p><p>凯文跑回C2收容所。 “我将相机移到了他实际的卧床位置。他住在河对岸。我等了。感觉像半个小时了。大概是几分钟了。终于他出来了。我马上认出了他。”</p><p> Kevin was looking at the man with the purple hat. The insurgent whose pattern of life he’d been tracking for hundreds of hours.</p><p> 凯文看着那个戴着紫色帽子的男人。他已经追踪了数百小时的生活方式的叛乱分子。</p><p> “He walked out of where he slept to go to the bathroom, wash his hands, stretch. I had visual positive identification on him.”</p><p> “他走出睡觉的地方去洗手，伸手。我对他有正面的视觉识别。”</p><p>   “Had a computer done the algorithm on the guy on the tractor, as far as the computer was concerned, that was him. The insurgent in the purple hat,” Kevin says. “But because I had already been watching this guy for months, I knew that it wasn’t.” Humans are still the ultimate recognizers. “We humans have the ability to recognize faces. It’s part of our genetics. Of however many thousands of years of being a hunter-gatherer. Of being able to spot recognizable features. I knew his face. I doubted the computer. I was right.”</p><p>   “就算是计算机，也有计算机对拖拉机上的那个家伙执行了算法。戴着紫色帽子的叛乱分子，”凯文说。 “但是因为我已经看了这个人好几个月了，所以我知道那不是。”人类仍然是最终的认可者。 “我们人类有能力识别人脸。这是我们遗传学的一部分。然而，作为狩猎采集者已有数千年的历史。能够发现可识别的功能。我知道他的脸。我怀疑计算机。我是正确的。”</p><p> How was the farmer on the tractor misrecognized as the cell leader in the purple hat in the first place? After the air strike was called off, and the man was spared execution, the PGSS operators rolled back the videotape to review what had happened. To see what they could learn.</p><p> 首先，如何将拖拉机上的农夫误认为紫色帽子的牢房领导？在取消空袭后，该人被处决，PGSS的操作员将录像带放回原处，以查看发生了什么。看看他们能学到什么。</p><p> “It was his hat,” Kevin explains. “There’s a window of time, around dawn, as the sun comes up,” he explains, where colors are “read differently” by the imaging system than how it sees them during the day. In this window of time, the farmer’s hat was misidentified as purple, setting off a series of linkages that were based on information that was erroneous to begin with.</p><p> “那是他的帽子，”凯文解释道。他解释说：“随着太阳升起，黎明前会有时间窗，”成像系统的颜色读取与白天的颜色读取方式有所不同。在这段时间里，农夫的帽子被错误地识别为紫色，从而引发了一系列基于错误信息的链接。</p><p>  But what if the S2 shop had killed the farmer in the purple hat in error? And what if, out of fear of backlash over yet another civilian casualty, the data that showed otherwise was deleted so that it would never become known? This invites the question: Who ha</p><p>  但是，如果S2商店错误地杀死了戴着紫色帽子的农夫，该怎么办？而且，如果由于担心又有平民伤亡而遭到打击，又将原本显示的数据删除了，以致永远不为人知怎么办？这引起了一个问题：谁哈 </p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/story/palantirs-gods-eye-view-of-afghanistan/">https://www.wired.com/story/palantirs-gods-eye-view-of-afghanistan/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/上帝/">#上帝</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/god/">#god</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/凯文/">#凯文</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
