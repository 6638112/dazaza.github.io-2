Authority is headquartered in Kingston, Jamaica, in a building that looks a bit like a prison and a bit like a Holiday Inn. The I.S.A., which has been described as \u201cchronically overlooked\u201d and is so obscure that even many Jamaicans don\u2019t know it exists, has jurisdiction over roughly half the globe.\n Under international law, countries control the waters within two hundred miles of their shores. Beyond that, the oceans and all they contain are considered \u201cthe common heritage of mankind.\u201d This realm, which encompasses nearly a hundred million square miles of seafloor, is referred to in I.S.A.-speak simply as the Area.\n  Scattered across the Area are great riches. Mostly, these take the shape of lumps that resemble blackened potatoes. The lumps, known formally as polymetallic nodules, consist of layers of ore that have built up around bits of marine debris, such as ancient shark teeth. The process by which the metals accumulate is not entirely understood; however, it\u2019s thought to be exceedingly slow. A single spud-size nugget might take some three million years to form. It has been estimated that, collectively, the nodules on the bottom of the ocean contain six times as much cobalt, three times as much nickel, and four times as much of the rare-earth metal yttrium as there is on land. They contain six thousand times as much tellurium, a metal that\u2019s even rarer than the rare earths.\n The first attempts to harvest this submerged wealth were undertaken nearly fifty years ago. In the summer of 1974, a drillship purportedly belonging to Howard Hughes\u2014the Hughes Glomar Explorer\u2014anchored north of Midway Atoll, ostensibly to bring up nodules from the depths. In fact, the ship was operated by the C.I.A., which was trying to raise a sunken Soviet submarine. But then, in a curious twist, a real company called Ocean Minerals leased the Glomar to collect nodules from the seabed west of Baja California. The president of the company likened the exercise to \u201cstanding on the top of the Empire State Building, trying to pick up small stones on the sidewalk using a long straw, at night.\u201d\n After the Glomar expeditions, interest in seabed mining waned. It\u2019s now waxing again. As one recent report put it, \u201cThe Pacific Ocean is the scene of a new wild west.\u201d Thirty companies have received permits from the I.S.A. to explore the Area. Most are looking to slurp up the nodules; others are hoping to excavate stretches of the ocean floor that are rich in cobalt and copper. Permits to begin commercial mining could be issued within a few years.\n Proponents of deep-sea mining argue that the sooner it starts the better. Manufacturing wind turbines, electric vehicles, solar panels, and batteries for energy storage requires resources, often scarce ones. (Tellurium is a key component in thin-film solar panels.) \u201cThe reality is that the clean-energy transition is not possible without taking billions of tons of metal from the planet,\u201d Gerard Barron, the chairman of the\u00a0Metals Company, one of the businesses that holds permits from the I.S.A., observed a few months ago. Seafloor nodules, he said, \u201coffer a way to dramatically reduce\u201d the environmental impact of extracting these tons.\n  But seabed mining poses environmental hazards of its own. The more scientists learn about the depths, the more extraordinary the discoveries. The ocean floor is populated by creatures that thrive under conditions that seem impossibly extreme. There is, for example, a ghostly pale deep-sea octopus that lays its eggs only on the stalks of nodule-dwelling sponges. Remove the nodules in order to melt them down and it will, presumably, take millions of years for new ones to form.\n Edith Widder is a marine biologist, a MacArthur Fellow, and the author of \u201c Below the Edge of Darkness: A Memoir of Exploring Light and Life in the Deep Sea\u201d (Random House). Widder is an expert on bioluminescence, a topic that she became interested in after nearly going blind. In 1970, when she was a freshman in college, she had to have surgery for a broken back. The surgery went fine, but afterward she started hemorrhaging. Her heart stopped beating, and she was resuscitated. This happened again, and then a third time. Blood leaked into both of her eyes, blocking her retinas. \u201cMy visual world was swirling darkness with occasional glimpses of meaningless light,\u201d she recalls. Eventually, she regained her vision, but she no longer took sight for granted.\n \u201cWe believe we see the world as it is,\u201d she writes. \u201cWe don\u2019t. We see the world as we need to see it to make our existence possible.\u201d\n The same goes for fish. Only the\u00a0top layers of the oceans are illuminated. The \u201csunlight zone\u201d extends down about seven hundred feet, the \u201ctwilight zone\u201d down another twenty-six hundred feet. Below that\u2014in the \u201cmidnight zone,\u201d\u00a0the \u201cabyssal zone,\u201d and the \u201chadal zone\u201d\u2014there\u2019s only blackness, and the light created by life itself. In this vast darkness, so many species have mastered the art of bioluminescence that Widder estimates they constitute a \u201cmajority of the creatures on the planet.\u201d The first time she descended into the deep in an armored diving suit called a  , she was overwhelmed by the display. \u201cThis was a light extravaganza unlike anything I could have imagined,\u201d she writes. \u201cAfterwards, when asked to describe what I had seen, I blurted, \u2018It\u2019s like the Fourth of July down there!\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n  Bioluminescent creatures produce light via chemical reaction. They synthesize luciferins, compounds that, in the presence of certain enzymes, known as luciferases, oxidize and give off photons. The trick is useful enough that\u00a0bioluminescence has evolved independently some fifty times. Eyes, too, have evolved independently about fifty times, in creatures as diverse as flies, flatworms, and frogs. But, Widder points out, \u201cthere is one remarkable distinction.\u201d All animals\u2019 eyes employ the same basic strategy to convert light to sensation, using proteins called opsins. In the case of\u00a0bioluminescence, different groups of organisms produce very different luciferins, meaning that each has invented its own way to shine.\n The most obvious reason to flash a light in the dark is to find food. Some animals, like the stoplight loosejaw, a fish with photon-emitting organs under each eye, use bioluminescence to seek out prey. Others, like the humpback blackdevil, hope to attract victims with their displays; the blackdevil sports a shiny lure that dangles off its forehead like a crystal from a chandelier.\n Bioluminescence also serves less straightforward functions. It can be used to entice mates and to startle enemies. The giant red mysid, a hamster-size crustacean, spews streams of blue sparkles from nozzles near its mouth; these, it\u2019s believed, distract would-be attackers. Some animals smear their pursuers with bioluminescent slime\u2014the marks make them targets for other predators\u2014and some use bioluminescence as camouflage. This last strategy is known as counterillumination, and it\u2019s used in the twilight zone, where many creatures have upward-looking eyes that scan for the silhouettes of prey. The prey can adjust their glow to blend in with the light filtering down from above.\n Since it\u2019s so hard for humans to get to  the deep sea\u2014and, once there, to record what they\u2019re seeing\u2014Widder has spent much of her career trying to figure out ways to study bioluminescence remotely. She\u2019s developed special deep-sea cameras that rely on red light, which marine creatures mostly can\u2019t detect. Much of \u201cBelow the Edge of Darkness\u201d is occupied with the travails of getting these cameras placed, a project that involves journeys so nauseating that Widder describes cycling through the five stages of seasickness. In the fourth, she explains, \u201cyou\u2019re afraid you\u2019re going to die,\u201d and in the last \u201cyou\u2019re\u00a0afraid you\u2019re not.\u201d\n  The experience that she really wants to convey, though, is not queasiness but wonder. The creatures of the deep have been putting on the world\u2019s greatest\u00a0light show for tens of millions of years. Widder thinks that if people could witness this spectacle\u2014or even just be made aware of it\u2014they\u2019d pay a lot more attention to life at the bottom of the seas and the many hazards that threaten it. These include but are not limited to global\u00a0warming, ocean acidification, overfishing, agricultural runoff, oil spills, invasive species, bottom trawling, plastic waste, and seabed mining.\n  \u201cWe seem to be in a Catch-22 scenario where we haven\u2019t explored the deep ocean because we don\u2019t appreciate what a remarkable, mysterious, and wondrous place it is, and we don\u2019t know what an astonishing place it is because we haven\u2019t explored it,\u201d she argues. Meanwhile, she writes, \u201cwe are managing to destroy the ocean before we even know what\u2019s in it.\u201d\n All marine photosynthesis takes place in the sunlight zone. Beneath that, food is in such short supply that the occasional dead whale that falls to the ocean floor represents a major source of nutrients. Nevertheless, even in the farthest recesses of the oceans, life finds a way.\n The Mariana snailfish, as its name suggests, occupies the Mariana Trench\u2014the ocean\u2019s deepest depression\u2014in the western Pacific. It\u2019s a few inches long\u00a0and looks like a large, pale-pink tadpole. The Mariana snailfish has been found more than twenty-six thousand feet below sea level, where the pressure is eight hundred times greater than at the surface. To survive under such conditions, the snailfish has come up with various ingenious adaptations: its skull is not completely closed, its bones are unusually rubbery, and it produces special chemicals to prevent its proteins from denaturing under stress. The creature can barely see and instead relies on fluid-filled chambers along its jaws, which detect the movements of small crustaceans known as amphipods. Amphipods, for their part, have been collected from the very bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost thirty-six thousand feet down, where the pressure is so great that the animals\u2019 shells, in theory at least, should dissolve. A team of Japanese scientists recently reported that one deep-dwelling amphipod,  Hirondellea gigas, protects its shell by coating it in an aluminum-based gel, produced from metal that it extracts from seafloor mud.\n  Some of the seas\u2019 most extraordinary animals live around hydrothermal vents\u2014the oceanic equivalents of hot springs. Through cracks in the seafloor, water comes in contact with the earth\u2019s magma; the process leaves it superheated and loaded with dissolved minerals. (At some vents, the water reaches a temperature of more than seven hundred degrees.) As the water rises and cools, the minerals precipitate out to form crenellated, castlelike structures. Hydrothermal vents had been theorized about for many years but remained unseen until 1977, when a team of geologists and geochemists travelling on a research vessel called the Knorr located one about two hundred and fifty miles northeast of the Gal\u00e1pagos. A pair of scientists went down to take a look at it in a submersible named Alvin.\n \u201cIsn\u2019t the deep ocean supposed to be like a desert?\u201d one of them asked over Alvin\u2019s phone link.\n   As Helen Scales, a British marine biologist, explains in her new book, \u201c The Brilliant Abyss: Exploring the Majestic Hidden Life of the Deep Ocean, and the Looming Threat That Imperils It\u201d (Grove Atlantic), \u201cthese animals\u201d turned out to be fundamentally different from other creatures. At the bottom of the vents\u2019 food chains are microbes that have come up with their own novel survival strategy. Instead of using photosynthesis, which harnesses the energy of photons, they rely on chemosynthesis, which uses the energy stored in chemical bonds. Since the late nineteen-seventies, Scales reports, researchers have catalogued hundreds of strange species living around vents; they include creatures so puzzling that it\u2019s hard to find a limb for them on the tree of life.\n Yeti crabs, first observed in 2005 on a vent system along the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, south of Easter Island, look like hairy white lobsters. Their \u201chairs\u201d are actually extensions of their shells, and along them live colonies of chemosynthetic bacteria, which the crabs scrape up and consume. Yeti crabs were found to be so evolutionarily distinctive that taxonomists had to create not just a new genus but a whole new family for them.\n Xenoturbella profunda is a creature that looks like a discarded tube sock. First collected from a vent system in the Gulf of California in 2015, it has no intestines or central nervous system, and scientists aren\u2019t even sure what phylum it belongs to.  Chrysomallon squamiferum, commonly referred to as the scaly-foot snail, is a mollusk that\u2019s been found at vents in the Indian Ocean, at a depth of ten thousand feet. It\u2019s the only animal known to build its shell with iron, and around its foot it sports a fringe of iron plates that looks a bit like a flamenco skirt. The snail carries around chemosynthesizing microbes in a special pouch in its throat. In 2019,  Chrysomallon squamiferum became the first vent-dwelling creature to be included on the Red List of Threatened Species, maintained by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The rationale for the listing is that the species has been found at only three sites, and two of these are being explored for mining. Its living space, the I.U.C.N. has observed, is thus apt to be \u201cseverely reduced or destroyed.\u201d\n Scales, like Widder, worries that the bottom of the ocean will be wrecked before many of the most marvellous creatures living there are even identified. \u201cThe frontier story has always been one of destruction and loss,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt is na\u00efve to assume that the process would play out any differently in the deep.\u201d Indeed, she argues, the depths are particularly ill-suited to disturbance because, owing to a scarcity of food, creatures tend to grow and reproduce extremely slowly. \u201cVital habitat is created by corals and sponges that live for millennia,\u201d she writes.\n If deep-sea mining proceeds, it\u2019s likely that one of the first countries to pursue it will be Nauru, a tiny nation that, as it happens, was itself almost destroyed by mining.\n About the size of Block Island, Nauru sits in the South Pacific, about sixteen hundred miles northeast of Papua New Guinea. For thousands of years, the island\u2019s largest visitors were birds, which used it, in the words of one journalist, as a \u201cglorified rest stop.\u201d Polynesians and Micronesians arrived on the island sometime around 1000 B.C. They seem to have lived harmoniously\u2014even idyllically\u2014until gun-toting Europeans showed up, in the early nineteenth century. At the start of the twentieth century, a New Zealander named Albert Ellis realized that the ancient bird droppings that coated the island were a rich source of phosphate, an important fertilizer. During the next six decades, more than thirty-five million tons of phosphate were dug out of Nauru and shipped off to farms in Europe and Australia. The process stripped much of the island bare, leaving nothing but jagged pillars of limestone sticking out of the ground. A  National Geographic photographer who visited Nauru mid-destruction wrote, \u201cA worked-out phosphate field is a dismal, ghastly tract.\u201d\n  In 1968, Nauru became its own country. The phosphate business was still booming, and, on paper, the island\u2019s ten thousand residents became some of the richest people in the world. The new nation used its sovereign wealth to invest in, among other things, cruise ships, airplanes, overseas office buildings, and a London musical based on the life of Leonardo da Vinci. The musical flopped, as did most of the other ventures. Nauruans \u201chave a long history of being taken to the cleaners by crooks\u201d is how Helen Hughes, an Australian economist, put it. In 2001, in return for various fees and payments, Nauru\u2019s government allowed Australia to set up a detention center for refugees on the island. The center soon became infamous for its grim conditions.\n  Today, with the phosphate mostly mined out and the refugees mostly resettled, Nauru is betting on nodules. To engage in deep-sea exploration and mining, a company must be sponsored by a country that\u2019s party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. (The U.S. is one of the few nations that has not ratified the Law of the Sea treaty, because of conservative opposition in the Senate.) Nauru has teamed up with the Metals Company, which is based in Canada, to explore a region of the Pacific known as the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, west of Mexico. \u201cWe are proud that Pacific nations have been leaders in the deep-sea minerals industry,\u201d a statement co-authored by Nauru\u2019s representative to the International Seabed Authority recently declared. The deal, it\u2019s estimated, could eventually bring the country more than a hundred million dollars a year. Alternatively, the arrangement could prove even more disastrous than the da Vinci musical. At one point, Nauru officials expressed concern to the I.S.A. that, if a sponsoring nation were held liable for damages arising from a mining operation, it could \u201cface losing more than it actually has.\u201d\n The I.S.A., for its part, has been assigned the task not just of issuing the permits for seabed mining but also of drafting the regulations to govern the practice. These regulations have yet to be finalized, so it\u2019s unclear how stringent they will be. (The final rules are supposed to be in place before commercial mining commences, though the Metals Company has threatened to try to start without them.) Many marine scientists argue that because deep-sea ecosystems are so fragile\u2014and operations that are miles below the surface so difficult to monitor\u2014the only safe way to proceed is not to. Scales makes this point, but acknowledges that the I.S.A. is unlikely to be swayed. She quotes Daniel Jones, a researcher at the British National Oceanography Centre, who says, \u201cEven if we found unicorns living on the seafloor, I don\u2019t think that would necessarily stop mining.\u201d Meanwhile, assuming that mining does go forward, it\u2019s been suggested that faux nodules could be manufactured and dropped by ship into the deep ocean, to replace those being refashioned into batteries. The perfect vessel for this task would have been the Glomar; unfortunately, a few years ago it was sold for scrap.\u00a0\u2666\n    Sign up for our daily  newsletter to receive the best stories from  The New Yorker.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 11:06:46", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4ee3\u4ef7,sea,\u6d77\u6d0b", "title": "\u6df1\u6d77\u5145\u6ee1\u4e86\u5b9d\u85cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4ee5\u4ee3\u4ef7\u4e3a\u6b62 ", "title_en": "The Deep Sea Is Filled with Treasure, but It Comes at a Price", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/06/21/the-deep-sea-is-filled-with-treasure-but-it-comes-at-a-price", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4ee3\u4ef7", "sea", "\u6d77\u6d0b"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "19f86dc46c81190c889c0518b49a1388.jpg", "infoid": 1066636, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u897f\u96c5\u56fe\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5927\u9ebb\u5e02\u573a\u53f6\u5b50\u5df2\u5173\u95ed\u65b0\u8d44\u91d12300\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u800cGeekwire\u4e0e\u516c\u53f8\u786e\u8ba4\u3002\u968f\u7740\u5927\u9ebb\u5e02\u573a\u5728\u5927\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u5927\u9ebb\u5e02\u573a\u770b\u5230\u9500\u552e\u5e02\u573a\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9500\u552e\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u9500\u552e\u989d\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u65b0\u9c9c\u7684\u73b0\u91d1\u8f93\u6db2\u5c31\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u3002\n \u542f\u52a8\u8ba1\u5212\u6269\u5c55\u5176\u5728\u7ebf\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u8ba9\u5ba2\u6237\u548c\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u8d2d\u4e70\u548c\u9500\u552e\u5927\u9ebb\u3002\u53f6\u5b50\u4e5f\u7528\u4f5c\u6559\u80b2\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u67091.2\u4ebf\u4eba\u6e38\u5ba2\u3002\n \u8d44\u91d1\u5c06\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u5165\u516c\u53f8\u7684160\u4eba\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u51e0\u5e74\u4e2d\u9075\u5faa\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u88c1\u5458\u3002\n   2020\u5e741\u6708\uff0c\u53f6\u5b50\u524a\u51cf\u4e8618\uff05\u7684\u5458\u5de5\uff0c\u621654\u4e2a\u804c\u4f4d\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dCeo-Ceo\u8482\u6885\u5229\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u201c\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5927\u9ebb\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u73b0\u5b9e\u201d\u3002\u4e24\u4e2a\u6708\u540e\uff0c\u5b83\u524a\u51cf\u4e8691\u540d\u5458\u5de5\uff0c\u6293\u4f4f\u4e86\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\n \u53f6\u5b50\u76ee\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98Yoko Miyashita\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u5bb6\u524d\u76d6\u8482\u56fe\u7247Exec\uff0c\u66fe\u57282019\u5e74\u52a0\u5165\u540e\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u5f8b\u5e08\u3002\n \u83b1\u65af\u5229\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u524d\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u7684\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u4e0d\u5230\u4e24\u5e74\u7684\u524d\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900aexec\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53eb\u505a\u751f\u6839\u7684\u519c\u4e1a\u975e\u8425\u5229\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u3002\n   \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6536\u5165\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u5927\u9ebb\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u652f\u4ed8\u7684\u6bcf\u6708\u8ba2\u9605\u8d39\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5e02\u5e76\u8bbf\u95ee\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u5b83\u8fd8\u4ece\u5e7f\u544a\u4e2d\u8d5a\u94b1\u3002 \n\u6839\u636e\u5927\u9ebb\u56fd\u5bb6\u7a0e\u6536\u548c\u6536\u5165\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u53f6\u5b50\u7684\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5927\u9ebb\u884c\u4e1a\u57282020\u5e74\u9500\u552e\u989d\u589e\u52a0\u4e8671\uff05\u3002\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u53bb\u5e74\u82b1\u4e86\u5927\u9ebb\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u7ea6183\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n \u53f6\u8302\u76db\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5927\u9ebb\u5408\u6cd5\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u6b63\u5728\u52a0\u901f\u5927\u9ebb\u5e02\u573a\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5c06\u5229\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u8d44\u91d1\u6765\u71c3\u6599\u8425\u9500\u5728\u4e1c\u6d77\u5cb8\uff0c\u51e0\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u6700\u8fd1\u5df2\u7ecf\u5408\u6cd5\u5316\u4e86\u5927\u9ebb\u3002\n \u5a31\u4e50\u5927\u9ebb\u4e3a16\u4e2a\u5dde\u548c\u54e5\u4f26\u6bd4\u4e9a\u5730\u533a\u7684\u6210\u5e74\u4eba\u5408\u6cd5\u3002 Medical Marijuana\u5728\u989d\u5916\u768420\u6b21\u989d\u5916\u662f\u5408\u6cd5\u7684\u3002\u636eInsider\u79f0\uff0c\u4eca\u5e743\u670831\u65e5\u7684\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5dde\u5408\u6cd5\u5316\u9505\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5f17\u5409\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5dde\u548c\u65b0\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u5dde\u7684\u65b0\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u5747\u53d1\u6325\u7740\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u7acb\u6cd5\u3002\n  \u5176\u4ed6\u516c\u53f8\u6b63\u5728\u56de\u5e94\u6f6e\u6d41 -

The platform has 120 million annual visitors.\n The funding will be used to add to the company\u2019s 160-person workforce and follows a series of layoffs over the past few years.\n   In January 2020, Leafly   cut 18%  of its staff, or 54 positions, which then-CEO  Tim Leslie attributed to \u201cmarket realities of the technology and cannabis sectors.\u201d It   cut 91 more employees two months later , citing the uncertainties caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\n Leafly is currently under the leadership of CEO  Yoko Miyashita, a former Getty Images exec who was previously the company\u2019s   general counsel after joining in 2019 .\n Leslie, a former Amazon exec who was Leafly\u2019s CEO for less than two years, is now a founder of a farming nonprofit called Living Roots.\n   The company\u2019s  revenue primarily comes from a monthly subscription fee paid by cannabis retailers to be listed on the platform and to access e-commerce tools. It also makes money from advertising.\n The cannabis industry saw a 71% increase in sales in 2020, according to   Leafly\u2019s report  based on marijuana state tax and revenue records. Americans spent about $18.3 billion on cannabis products last year.\n Leafly said marijuana legalization trends are accelerating the cannabis market. The company will use the new funding to fuel marketing on the east coast, where several states have legalized marijuana recently.\n Recreational marijuana is legal for adults in 16 states and the District of Columbia. Medical marijuana is legal in an additional 20 more. Some of these changes were made this year, with New York legalizing pot on March 31, and both Virginia and New Mexico passing similar legislation, which will take effect this summer, according to   Insider .\n  Other companies are responding to the trend \u2014 tech-giant Amazon just announced it would   stop screening certain job applicants for drug use , and it   backed federal legislation  that would legalize and decriminalize pot.\n Investors are also getting on the cannabis boom.  Dutchie , an Oregon-based cannabis e-commerce platform,   announced $200 million in new funding  in March. The company was valued at $1.7 billion.\n  Leafly has raised $38 million in total funding. The recent round was led primarily by existing investors, but Leafly didn\u2019t disclose specific firms or individuals.\n  That means seed stage investing \u2014 an average of 30% of their initial investments are in seed stage companies.\n What goes into the process of securing seed funding?

Along with Ancestry, it has helped pioneer the idea that genetic testing is not just a medical field, but a big consumer business. Its at-home testing kits, which allowed people to learn about their genetic profiles and ancestry by sending a bit of saliva through the mail, ushered in a new era of personalized medicine, though not without controversy.\n 23andMe, a five-time  CNBC Disruptor 50 company, has not had a straight or sure path to success as a public company.\n It faced FDA scrutiny earlier in its history; continues to face questions about consumer privacy as it gathers genetic information on millions of individuals; ran into financial challenges in recent years as the market for personalized genetic tests seemed to get saturated; skepticism over the basis for its gene-based risk analysis remains contentious; and as it dives deeper into drug development, a gap in its current customer base and underlying genetic data between a majority European genetic profile and underrepresentation of many minority and ethnic groups.\n &#34;It will take time ... really making sure we are getting all communities to participate in research,&#34; Wojcicki said in an interview with CNBC&#39;s &#34;TechCheck&#34; on Thursday morning. &#34;You can&#39;t make discoveries in a population if you don&#39;t have those people participating. We need the right customers and to represent the product back to them in the right way.&#34;\n  Wojcicki says the company sees big things ahead for both its consumer and drug research &amp; development platforms. Roughly 80% of 23andMe&#39;s now-11 million members opt into sharing their genetic information (de-identified) for research in drug development.\n &#34;Our genetics represent all of life on this planet, and we have the opportunity to understand what it means and with that, it will improve your own life but also contribute to all kinds of research discoveries,&#34; Wojcicki said.\n She says the controversy over the medical utility of the information when put in the hands of consumers won&#39;t go away, and it ranges on a spectrum from critical, clinical information, such as mutations in the gene that causes breast cancer, BRCA, to &#34;more controversial&#34; genetic information on Alzheimer&#39;s Disease variants. Some individuals with higher risk of blood clots make the decision to walk around more during plane flights as a result of their 23andMe reports.\n But she added that consumers have shown they want this information to help them make decisions.\n She said in the case of Alzheimer&#39;s risk, &#34;This information ... really influences how they live their life ... how they plan to retire ... plan to be older.&#34;\n Her own 10-year-old son used the company&#39;s lactose intolerance analysis to diagnose his stomach aches and Wojcicki herself, while reticent to discuss her personal use of the product, did say as the daughter of a woman who suffered from breast cancer and who has a higher risk of the disease, the information does influence her decision on having that &#34;recreational glass of wine.&#34;\n &#34;The last 15 years was putting together the infrastructure for how we can take off, proving to consumers we can get the information and proving they can understand it without a medical professional,&#34; she said.\n She says the key to its future is that consumers want to use the information to not only change their life but contribute to drug discovery.\n  &#34;We want them to truly have a personalized health-care experience and ... benefit the human genome from seeing all of this aggregated data turned into therapeutic programs,&#34; Wojcicki said. &#34;When I think about the future of therapeutics, in the next five years it is really about moving these programs forward and getting them into the clinic.&#34;\n The company also recently launched a subscription product to introduce more content and services for consumers who want to take additional steps after their genetic reports.\n &#34;We get thousands of people who call every week to the customer care team who would like to know how to use this information and apply it to live a healthier longer life,&#34; she said.\n The IPO market has already set an  annual record for deal volume in 2021, at $171 billion, and only halfway through the year. Average first day trade gains in deals this year have been above 40%. Though both traditional IPO market and SPAC returns have cooled off in recent months, with the Renaissance IPO ETF and the CNBC SPAC Index negative year-to-date after starting 2021 with a continuation of last year&#39;s big gains. Meanwhile,  concerns about SPAC deals have mounted and some high-profile SPACs like Branson&#39;s Virgin Galactic and electric vehicle maker Lordstown Motors have shown high levels of volatility.\n Nevertheless, Branson and other investors are  planning to bring another space business public, satellite internet service Virgin Orbit, via a SPAC in the weeks ahead.\n This story has been updated for the company&#39;s closing price in its first day of trading on Thursday.\n SIGN UP\u00a0 for our weekly, original newsletter that goes beyond the list, offering a closer look at CNBC Disruptor 50

", "note_en": "I\u2019ve written before about my time at  Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in the late 1990s, working on  a disastrous incentive program to build Alpha workstations. This one is another tale of Digital, but for it we need to go back a decade earlier. Back to 1986 when I joined the company, fresh out of college.\n I grew up in the late 70s/early 80s, idolizing DEC. It was the cool computer tech company that had produced the  PDP-8 mini, which I learned to program on, and later the  VAX 11/780, which I had used in some of my earliest computer courses I took while still in high school. Thinking they were the best computer company may have been  primacy bias on my part, perhaps. But there was no debating that Digital was a dominant force in the market, holding the number two computer manufacturer spot, behind IBM, and a desirable place for a new engineer to work.\n But by the time I was a Senior in college, it was strangely not I that went looking for a job at DEC; it was DEC that found me. I had in fact \u201cuneven\u201d grades let\u2019s say, and I was really just searching to find a job of any sort, as graduation neared. As fate would have it though, a school alumni who worked at Digital came by, looking for a college hire. The professor who\u2019s lab I worked in recommended me, and the next thing you know, I was renting my first car, to drive out to Shrewsbury, Massachusetts for an interview.\n I was worried about having to explain some of my grades, but the subject, luckily, never came up. They asked a few digital logic questions which I could definitely handle, and they were very interested in my senior design project, a microprocessor-based LAN/router I had built that later won best project at the school that year. (Having that project to talk about was definitely a lifesaver and welcome distraction from explaining my calculus woes!)\n They made me an offer the next day, and there was absolutely no debate in my head about taking it. So I went to work at my dream company, and I still remember the feeling of walking into work on day one and seeing my office and name plate, with brand new  VAXcluster-connected  VT100 terminal of my own ready for me, and thinking  \u201cHoly shit, I\u2019m working for Digital!\u201d\n I got an apartment about a mile down the road from the plant, but on day one in ESD, I learned that my assigned project was actually going to be at the office in Littleton, Massachusetts, 25 miles to the north. DEC of the day was this giant, spreading organism with offices sprouting up on an almost weekly basis in one town or another in the western suburbs of Boston. Inter-office hopping was common, and DEC would pay mileage for people who had to travel, and even had a fleet of helicopters to shuttle people around.\n Our ESD division in Shrewsbury had the job of designing the memory systems (dynamic ram) for all of DEC\u2019s products. My group worked on the main memory systems for VAX mainframes, which at the time were very complex beasts with a lot of specialized hardware for controlling things like interleaving, error detection and correction, self-test diagnostics, and ram refresh handling.\n  Later as computers became smaller, a lot of this specialized memory hardware was either not needed, or incorporated into ICs, and memory systems for computers in general became a commodity. By the time of my adventures in the Alpha workstations group in the 90\u2019s, there would no longer be a centralized storage group at DEC, for memory design anyway, and this idea that hardware could become a commodity had stuck in my head and was pushing me to (eventually) move to a software career.\n 1986 was a different matter. Our ESD group then was busy working on many products across the company, including several very large and as it turns out, competing mainframe designs. I would drive up to Littleton every day to work on my assigned product, which was a new VAX mainframe code-named \u201cArgonaut\u201d. This was to be a third-generation offering from the Midrange Systems Business (MSB) division of DEC, which had previously designed and built the  VAX 8800 series.\n The target market for the MSB group was medium-sized businesses: bigger than a mom-and-pop shop with only a few employees, but not a giant multinational company. Able to afford maybe hundreds of thousands for a computer, but not millions. This was a huge, growing market, and a host of minicomputer companies were playing in it, like  Data General,  Apollo, and  Prime Computer. But the big concern on everyone\u2019s minds in the various hardware groups around DEC was almost always \u201cBig Blue\u201d \u2014 IBM.\n  I don\u2019t remember having a lot of discussions about our competition, but there was a de-facto attitude among the engineers I hung out with anyway that the other minicomputer companies, such as Data General and Apollo, were just copycat wannabes \u2014 never able to match Digitals accomplishments, and not really a threat. IBM though held a different place in the threat hierarchy for us. I would say they commanded a lot more respect, being the number one computer company, and historically a major force in the development of computer technology.\n That didn\u2019t mean we thought they were better than us though. IBM\u2019s image at DEC was one of a stuffy, slow, old-school company who\u2019s time had already come and gone. (Ironically, that was very close to being true for DEC at this point, and in fact IBM would outlive us.) IBM was business-focused, and in a seemingly over-formal, boring way. Their engineers all wore ties, we were told (not entirely true, even in 1986), where at DEC, you would be made fun of if you showed up to work first day wearing a tie, even if you were a manager.\n And so I worked in the company thinking IBM was both technically and culturally the enemy. But within the hardware groups that were building mainframe computers, IBM was also the target to be emulated, and hopefully surpassed. DEC was creating bigger and bigger systems, and the once rack-sized minicomputers of the PDP era had given way to larger, multi-cabinet setups, even within the midrange business unit that in theory was supposed to be making smaller, cheaper computers.\n I worked for over a year on Argonaut, designing memory controller chips that handled our double-bit error correction and self test pattern generation, and working on the ram array design. We had completed the chip designs and simulations, and were to the point where we were getting close to building hardware.\n It was a crazy, incredible time, and I had the good fortune to work with and learn from some very talented people there, including a few who went on to be chip design superstars.  Jim Keller and  Pete Bannon to name a couple, but if I am going to name drop, I would also need to say that I was a very junior engineer, on the periphery of things. So I rarely interacted directly with the CPU design team and did not know those guys personally too well.\n One day though I was sitting in a lab back in Shrewsbury doing going over our design specs with some techs there, and I got a call from the Littleton office. They said management had called a big meeting, and it was about the project and I needed to get back to the office right away. I got in my car and drove up immediately, but it was a short meeting and by the time I got up there, it was over. The takeaway from it was, Argonaut had been cancelled.\n I and safe to say a very large majority of people there were completely blind-sided by this, as cancellation had not been even a fleeting thought for us. We were laser-focused on completing our design, and getting it out into the battlefield against IBM. But technology problems had crept in, and the management and some of the senior technical staff there had been quietly trying to resolve a major obstacle that had cropped up with the I/O structure of the gate array chips we were using.\n For the technical, this was an issue of simultaneous switching, causing signal integrity problems. It was a big issue, the kind that would normally lead to a major project delay, and possibly some people being fired for making poor technical decisions (but honestly, at DEC we never fired anyone, we were really bad at it)\n It could have been fixed, eventually though. Cancellation should have been off the table for a project like this, since building a next-generation business mainframe was at the time, a mission-critical thing for us.\n The reason that cancellation of a year-or-more-long effort involving hundreds of engineers was feasible in the minds of DEC\u2019s upper management was this: they had another competing product under development in the company to go to.\n Fifteen miles to the south, in Marlborough, Massachusetts, sat a hulking fortress of a building that Digital called \u201cMRO1\u201d. MRO1 was a three-story concrete and glass structure, originally built in 1969 by RCA for use as factory space. It was later purchased by DEC for manufacturing use as well, but eventually converted to office space that was home to a major division of the company - High Performance Systems (HPS).\n The sprawling factory floor that had years previously built  DECSystem-20s was now a sea of cubicles for the HPS engineering staff, the sheer scale of which was beyond anything I had ever seen, or have seen since. The Argonaut engineers from the much-smaller MSB building in Littleton would fit in one corner of this giant office complex.\n  This was Digital\u2019s \u201cbig computer\u201d division, the group that was tasked with going after IBMs core business with very large, and very expensive mainframe computer designs. And if the MSB division in Littleton had IBM-envy, it was nothing compared with what was going on over in Marlborough. HPS was very much trying to be IBM, so much so that there had been a mini cultural shift from the DEC norm going on there, with managers wearing ties and a general higher level of formality of engineering processes.\n  After the cancellation of Argonaut, there was a week-long, drunken party at the house of one of the engineers, \u201cNancy\u201d, who had a place with a big back yard and an inground pool. The day they announced the news we were all in shock, and Nancy came to the rescue, inviting everyone over for an impromptu party \u2014 which was a badly needed distraction for all involved. I don\u2019t remember much of it, I think Jim Keller threw me into the pool at one point, (which may have counted as the most significant interaction we ever had.)\n  It was supposed to be a one day party, but as everyone soon found out, there was nothing to do at work. People would show up in the morning, and the management would give out stuff to read and research, like some things about MIPS architecture that we were looking into. But then everyone would just kind of leave, and we\u2019d end up at Nancy\u2019s house with suntan lotion, coolers and barbeque supplies, probably much to her dismay after two or three days.\n The party eventually ended, but things went on over the summer in the same way: you would show up to work, see if anything was going on, management would say \u201cstay tuned\u201d, and you would go home. It amazed me even then that a company would allow this to happen. There were no layoffs, no reassignments to different groups, they just let everything float for pretty much the summer. It must have cost a fortune, and I highly doubt anything would go down like this ever again in today\u2019s tech business world.\n My situation that summer was different though, owing to the fact that I was actually not part of the MSB division, but part of Electronic Storage Development. I was a centralized resource, who could be deployed on other projects easily. My managers were not about to let me have the summer off, since HPS was in the middle of their own giant mainframe project, code-named \u201cAquarius\u201d. I was reassigned to this project, which was also in the late stages of development.\n It was not an easy transition for me. Although organizationally, I worked for an outside group, I had been embedded in the MSB design team for over a year and had become quite loyal to our effort, and felt like part of the tribe. HPS to us was not a group we thought about much, but probably when we did, we lumped them into the \u201cIBM\u201d category of being a bloated, overly-formal, stuffy division.\n There was not much if any communication or technical exchange between the HPS and MSB design teams, even though we were working on very similar products. So I didn\u2019t know what, if any, transferrable knowledge I gained from working on Argonaut could be applied to working on Aquarius.\n Once I got to Marlborough, I found that the HPS engineers were much more prone to looking over their shoulders at what might be going on over at MSB, and did in fact consider the ever-larger machines coming out of that division to be a competing threat to their work. They were all quite happy Argonaut was cancelled, and the product management there expanded the Aquarius product line to include a lower-end variant, called \u201cAridus\u201d to fill in the gap left by the cancellation of our project. The whole Aquarius program had been envisioned as an \u201cIBM Killer\u201d, but its first (and spoiler, only) victim would be a product within the same company.\n And so it was very hard not to feel out of place, working in HPS \u2014 almost like I was an exchange student, or perhaps, captured prisoner. I remember listening to HPS people disparage the product group in MSB, and then ask me if the people there did the same kind of thing when talking about HPS. I was the rare guy who had been over enemy lines, and they would often ask about what things were like in MSB, as if we were talking about Russia or something. I kind of shrugged, because honestly we did not spend a lot of time in MSB thinking about them.\n Someone should have though, obviously. Today I find it ridiculous that a major corporation would allow huge groups to silo to this degree, to fail to communicate, cooperate, and share, and to allow them to build overlapping and competing products. To allow this kind of animosity to build between employees of the same company. We\u2019re talking about thousands of engineers involved here, between the two divisions. Seems like something that could have only happened in the crazy 1980\u2019s, but I am betting if enough people read this far, we will see comments to the contrary.\n This siloed competition phenomenon in fact happens a lot, and I have seen lesser versions of this play out at other, smaller companies I\u2019ve worked for. Sometimes it is just a matter of two groups colliding with each other and trying to do the same thing, or even two individuals. The common goal of beating the external competition gives way to an internal fight for control of something, fueled by lack of communication and sometimes, lack of trust.\n Maybe its too simplistic a take, but for me it all of it owes to a failure of management, somewhere in the end. Easy to say I know, and not always easily or effectively addressed, but in essence avoidable. DEC\u2019s version of this failure was just perhaps a bigger example of competitive siloing that is allowed to manifest at many companies, very often to negative effect.\n The Aquarius project for its part turned out to be a billion dollar disaster, and that doesn\u2019t even count however much money was spent on our cancelled Argonaut project. Released in 1989 as the  VAX 9000, only a few dozen were sold, despite the billion dollar development cost.\n  Much of this failure owes to technical missteps, to be clear. Aquarius was so-named because it was a water cooled system, a necessity due to the enormous power demands of the bipolar transistor, emitter-coupled logic (ECL) technology used in the system. This technology was in favor at the time due to its speed, but required exotic cooling and interconnect technology that required an army of mechanical and thermal engineers to design.\n It all would soon be eclipsed by superior CMOS chip technology, which offered good performance with much less power required. This in turn allowed chips to be scaled up in size, reducing chip counts and thus interconnect delays between chips, boosting the overall performance of the entire system.\n And to be fair - our cancelled Argonaut project also utilized ECL chip technology, so would have had similar drawbacks. In the end, the winner (within DEC anyway) in this competitive CPU design contest was neither the Littleton MSB group or the Marlborough HPS group, but what was coming out of our chip foundry in Hudson, Massachusetts. Fast VLSI CMOS processors, starting with the  microVAX chip sets but eventually leading to the high-performance Alpha chip, would soon dominate the company, eliminating CPU design groups in both MSB and HPS.\n Maybe if we had moved these mainframe projects to CMOS earlier, there would have been a way for both these projects to succeed in the marketplace, who knows. And the larger strategic issue of DEC being slow to follow the \u201csmaller, cheaper, better\u201d route that the industry pivoted to once CMOS technology matured is also a huge factor in our companies decline \u2014 and beyond the scope of this story.\n It could be that failure was just in the cards for us. When I think back on this time though, I keep returning to the idea that we would have been in a much better position somehow if these company divisions had worked together, rather than competed as rivals. (In writing this, the word \u201cdivisions\u201d in the first place seems very tell-tale.)\n Certainly the R&amp;D costs would have been lower, and maybe a cooperating set of R&amp;D groups could have come up with a better technical solution. Or if MSB had targeted a lower-end market segment with less overlap, perhaps their project would not have been cancelled, and at least on of the two projects would have succeeded in making a profit. Whatever the case, the whole combined thing had to have gone down as one of the most expensive blunders in computer development history.\n I remember in 1993, after it had become clear that Aquarius was a flop, attending an R&amp;D staff meeting in an auditorium in Digital\u2019s famous \u201cMill\u201d headquarters in Maynard, Massachusetts, where I was then working in the Alpha Workstations group. DEC\u2019s stock price had dropped, we were in the midst of a series of layoffs, and a discontented crowd had gathered to hear Jack Smith, Chief Operating Officer of the company, speak.\n Jack was not well liked by a lot of the engineering staff, and had in the past done things such as send out a memo complaining about how the parking lot at the Mill was only half full at 9AM, where in the old days it was always full. When he was not accusing people of shorting their work hours, he was green-lighting bad product decisions, like funding two largely overlapping projects that used soon-to-be-obsolete technology. I don\u2019t remember the content of the meeting, probably a pep talk of some sort, but I do remember the Q&amp;A that followed.\n A bold engineer stood up and said bluntly that the company had spent one billion dollars developing a computer that no one wanted, and that if we had instead invested in literally anything else, such as for instance McDonald\u2019s franchises, we would have made more money. Jack (who was obviously bad at reading a room, or otherwise he would not have scheduled a Q&amp;A in the first place) stood there numbly and only said:\n    Many other armchair analysists and MBA students have debated the causes of Digital\u2019s downfall, and there is probably no new ground left to cover here. And I don\u2019t know to what degree the unchecked redundancy and inter-division competition played in the failures of these mainframe projects, or of Digital in general. But do I know it certainly didn\u2019t help. For me, the memories of these projects remain as an cautionary reminder of what can happen when people in an organization fail to cooperate with each other.\n Shortly after the events of this story, Digital would close its iconic Maynard headquarters, along with many other offices in order to control costs.

How was it possible that plutocrats such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Warren Buffett could pay nothing in income taxes to the federal government? What sneaky sleights of pen, what subterfuge, what acts of turpitude could have led to this result?\n   The shock stems, in part, from a disturbing reality: Nowhere does ProPublica assert that these men cheated, lied, or did anything felonious to lower their tax burdens. The naked fact of the matter is that not a single one of the documented methods and practices that allowed these billionaires to so radically minimize their tax obligations was illegal.\n What\u2019s worse, these methods and practices\u2014things such as offsetting income with losses in unrelated businesses; structuring assets to grow rather than generate income, then borrowing against those growing assets for cash needs; and deducting interest payments and state taxes from taxable income\u2014are so downright mundane and commonly applied that most rich people don\u2019t see them as unethical. The more interesting question is not how the men in ProPublica\u2019s report were able to avoid paying much or anything in federal income taxes, but why. What motivates people with so much money to try to withhold every last bit of it from the public\u2019s reach?\n  One factor is the common ideology that underlies all of these practices: The government is bad and cannot be trusted with money. Far better for the wealthy to keep as much of it as possible for themselves and use (a fraction of) it to do benevolent things through philanthropy.\n   My grandfather Roy O. Disney, who co-founded the Walt Disney Company with his brother Walt, was a fervent believer in this idea. He was so determined to prevent the government from taking any of the money he wanted to leave to his family that he created generation-skipping trusts to end-run the IRS. What he did back then was so effective that most of it is illegal today.\n I will protest to my dying breath that he was a good man\u2014one of the best, in fact.\n But I will also add, at the very end of that dying breath, that he should not have been able to do that.\n Practically speaking, the way the trusts were devised meant that I came into a significant amount of money at the tender age of 21. I became an asset manager before a lot of people get their first apartment. I\u2019m 61 now, meaning I\u2019ve been the recipient of four decades\u2019 worth of tax advice from the decent, good, kind men (yes, they were all men) who were put in place by my grandparents, and then my parents, to ensure that I wouldn\u2019t do anything stupid with what I had been given.\n  Every single method and practice outlined in the ProPublica report has been suggested to me at one time or another by these decent men as a credible, perfectly legal, and not-at-all-questionable way to manage my assets. And, over the years, I have said yes to many of those suggestions. So it\u2019s true: If you were to get a hold of my tax returns, you would find a record of a person who has adhered scrupulously to the law and, in doing so, has also taken advantage of the many holes our legal system has left wide open.\n When you come into money as I did\u2014young, scared, and not very savvy about the world\u2014you are taught certain precepts as though they are gospel: Never spend the \u201ccorpus\u201d (also known as the capital) you were left. Steward your assets to leave even more to your children, and then teach them to do the same. And finally, use every tool at your disposal within the law, especially through estate planning, to keep as much of that money as possible out of the hands of government bureaucrats who will only misuse it.\n  If you are raised in a deeply conservative family like my own, you are taught some extra bits of doctrine: Philanthropy is good, but too much of it is unseemly and performative. Marry people \u201cof your own class\u201d to save yourself from the complexity and conflict that come with a broad gulf in income, assets, and, therefore, power. And, as one of my uncles said to me during the Reagan administration, it\u2019s best to leave the important decision making to people who are \u201csuccessful,\u201d rather than in the pitiable hands of those who aren&#39;t.\n  I took far too long to look with clarity upon these precepts and see them for what they are: blueprints for dynastic wealth. Why it took me so long is a fair question. All I know is that if you are a fish, it is hard to describe water, much less to ask if water is necessary, ethical, and structured the way it ought to be. As long as no one so much as raised an eyebrow about the ethics of  the CRAT,  the CRUT, and the credit swap, who did I think I was to query the fundamentals? I did not have the emotional courage to go down that path.\n  There was another reason for my inaction, and I am deeply ashamed to say what it was. But here goes: Having money\u2014a lot of money\u2014is very, very nice. It\u2019s damn hard to resist the seductions of what money buys you. I\u2019ve never been much of a materialist, but I have wallowed in the less concrete privileges that come with a trust fund, such as time, control, security, attention, power, and choice. The fact is, this is pretty standard software that comes with the hardware of a human body.\n As time has passed, I have realized that the dynamics of wealth are similar to the dynamics of addiction. The more you have, the more you need. Whereas once a single beer was enough to achieve a feeling of calm, now you find that you can\u2019t stop at six. Likewise, if you move up from coach to business to first class, you won\u2019t want to go back to coach. And once you\u2019ve flown private, wild horses will never drag you through a public airport terminal again.\n  Comforts, once gained, become necessities. And if enough of those comforts become necessities, you eventually peel yourself away from any kind of common feeling with the rest of humanity.\n  I tell you all this not to defend myself; that\u2019s between me and my conscience. I am telling you this because human nature is a mighty force, and fighting it requires understanding it.\n What has caused me to question my indoctrination has been ethics. Goddamn ethics. For many people, especially those most deeply embedded in the culture of having and getting money, ethics are a wispy and ineffectual nuisance\u2014an abstract set of principles that can\u2019t possibly stand up to the rigors of life lived fast, business conducted efficiently, and competitors devoured and cast aside.\n The older I\u2019ve gotten and the more clearly I\u2019ve understood these things, the more the impulse to betray my own class has taken charge of my judgment.\n What\u2019s shocking about the ProPublica report is not just that the tax bills are so low, but that these billionaires can live with themselves.\n If your comfort requires that society be structured so that a decent percentage of your fellow citizens live in a constant state of terror about whether

companies are hiring for remote positions that can be performed in any state across the U.S. except one: Colorado.\n  At issue is a new Colorado law that requires companies with even a few employees in the state to disclose the expected salary or pay range for each open role they advertise, including remote positions. The rule\u2019s aim is to narrow  gender wage gaps and provide greater pay transparency for employees. To avoid having to disclose that information, though, some employers  seeking remote workers nationwide are saying that those living in Colorado need not apply.\n  Across the internet, an array of job listings state the work can\u2019t be done in Colorado. At Johnson &amp; Johnson, roles recently posted for a commercial finance senior manager and a senior manager in operations include  this caveat: \u201cWork location is flexible if approved by the Company except that position may not be performed remotely from Colorado.\u201d At commercial real-estate giant CBRE Group Inc., an ad for a project management director  notes in bold: \u201cThis position may be performed remotely anywhere within the United States except the State of Colorado.\u201d\n  At pharmaceutical distributor  McKesson  , postings for a sales specialist and a research quality manager include  similar disclaimers. Job listings for a scientist, an account executive and a manager of international tax planning at rival  Cardinal Health   also note: \u201cThis is a remote, work from home position. This role is to be filled outside of the state of Colorado.\u201d\n    Johnson &amp; Johnson and CBRE declined to comment, and McKesson and Cardinal Health didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n  Businesses have argued, in part, that Colorado\u2019s rules are overly burdensome administratively for employers. The Rocky Mountain Association of Recruiters, a trade group, sought an injunction against the pay transparency rules earlier this year. Last month, a federal judge denied that request, allowing the rules to stand.\n    While labor and legal experts say there is nothing technically stopping Coloradans from still applying and being eligible for such jobs, the disclaimers are likely to discourage people  wanting to work remotely from the state from pursuing such opportunities.\n  Do you think the Colorado pay law will spark a trend, or will other states be discouraged from passing similar legislation? Join the conversation below.\n  \u201cYou can\u2019t stop the internet essentially at a state line. Anyone can apply for anything,\u201d said Laura A. Mitchell, a Denver based principal at the law firm Jackson Lewis P.C. \u201cThe question comes down to whether or not an employer would actually consider that candidate for the role.\u201d\n  The job-posting language is also drawing scrutiny from Colorado officials. The state\u2019s Department of Labor and Employment recently opened an investigation into a complaint about at least one company\u2019s remote job posting excluding Colorado residents, said Scott Moss, director of the department\u2019s division of labor standards and statistics, who declined to name the company or who filed the complaint.\n  A number of states, including California, have enacted legislation in recent years that ban employers from asking for an applicant\u2019s salary history or added requirements for employers to disclose pay ranges upon request. One difference in Colorado\u2019s Equal Pay for Equal Work Act\u2014which went into effect in January\u2014is its provision that employers publicly disclose compensation and benefits for each job posting in the state.\n    In the remote-work era where jobs can conceivably be done anywhere, that has led to some confusion, state officials say. Colorado has told employers they don\u2019t need to disclose compensation for roles to be performed entirely outside of the state. Nor do the pay-disclosure requirements apply to remote jobs posted by a company that doesn\u2019t have any Colorado employees. But if an employer does have a presence in Colorado, it would need to post salary information\u2014even for a remote job\u2014Mr. Moss said.\n  Many companies now do include pay information specific to Colorado on remote job postings.  A listing for a software development engineer on a \u201cwork-from-anywhere\u201d team at  Amazon.com  for instance, notes that the range for the position in Colorado is $116,400 to $160,000 a year, but overall compensation could vary. Amazon\u2019s listing cites Colorado\u2019s Equal Pay for Equal Work Act as its reason for including the compensation information.\n  \u201cOur experience has been the law so far appears to be a great success at getting job postings to include the pay,\u201d Mr. Moss said.\n    Some Colorado remote workers say they are frustrated that other employers appear to be excluding them from such positions. Aaron Batilo, a software engineer near Denver, began working remotely in August 2019, and said he has found both greater pay and opportunities by remaining in Colorado and working for companies headquartered outside the state. When a former colleague mentioned that some remote job listings stated the positions were unavailable to Coloradans, his initial reaction was disbelief. \u201cThat would be such a red flag,\u201d he said.\n  But after spotting a discussion about more such postings on a Reddit forum last month, Mr. Batilo decided to act. He took a day off work and spent 12 hours building a site,  ColoradoExcluded.com, that tracks job listings that explicitly note they are not open to work in Colorado. He spends about five to 10 hours a week updating the site and manually verifying that listings exclude Colorado.

Ford is betting that the software developed by the three-year-old San Francisco startup will help it capture more than $1 billion in revenue just from charging by 2030. Ford Pro has financial ambitions beyond charging. The business unit said it expects to generate $45 billion in revenue from hardware and adjacent and new services by 2025 \u2014 up from $27 billion in 2019.\n Electriphi, along with its 30-person team, will be folded into the newly minted Ford Pro business unit, which is focused on providing services to commercial customers of its electric Transit van and F-150 Lightning Pro pickup truck. Ford will start shipping E-Transit to customers later this year. The F-150 Lightning Pro, a commercial variant of the all-electric Lightning pickup truck, is expected to come to market in spring 2022.\n  \u201cAs commercial customers add electric vehicles to their fleets, they want depot charging options to make sure they\u2019re powered up and ready to go to work every day,\u201d said Ford Pro CEO Ted Cannis. \u201cWith Electriphi\u2019s existing advanced technology IP in the Ford Pro electric vehicles and services portfolio, we will enhance the experience for commercial customers and be a single-source solution for fleet-depot charging.\u201d\n Electriphi launched in 2018 when it became obvious that upcoming state and federal mandates would drive heavy duty vehicles and mid-sized commercial fleets towards electrification, co-founder and CEO Muffi Ghadiali told TechCrunch in a recent interview. The company has focused on segments deploying commercial electric vehicles in the U.S. and internationally, a list that includes school buses and transit buses.\n \u201cIf you just think about what\u2019s going to happen in the next 10 years \u2014 it\u2019s a massive transformation in mobility for energy and software,\u201d\u00a0 Ghadiali said. \u201cThe stakes are incredibly high and time is running out.\u201d He noted fleet operators are nervous about that upcoming mandates that will require moving to zero-emissions vehicles by the end of the decade. \u201cTo turn over your entire fleet in 10 years, you have to start now; they\u2019re going, \u2018I have to make sure that my fleet operations don\u2019t skip a heartbeat, while this transition is happening.&#39;\u201d\n Ford first approached Electriphi in early 2021. The startup had raised just $4.2 million at a valuation of about $11 million prior to the deal with autoomaker.\n While Ford\u2019s focus is building out the software for its E-Transit and Lightning Pro, it is possible that it will also continue to serve Electriphi\u2019s customer base.\n \u201cInterestingly, as it turns out, the underlying Ford platform is used across many different vehicle types as well as school buses,\u201d Ghadiali said. \u201cSo it\u2019s hard to say which segments we won\u2019t still be in because they are you know they are very relevant to what we do. Of course, our focus will be the large volume that the Ford is going to ship in the next year.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-18 09:46:35", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u798f\u7279,\u6536\u8d2d,acquires", "title": "\u798f\u7279\u6536\u8d2dElectivehi\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u51c6\u5907Woo EV\u8230\u961f\u5ba2\u6237 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tFord acquires Electriphi as it prepares to woo EV fleet customers\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/ford-acquires-electriphi-as-it-prepares-to-woo-ev-fleet-customers/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u798f\u7279", "\u6536\u8d2d", "acquires"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "ccac20c28dfb2c5abb7f7aa763a60e06.jpeg", "infoid": 1066628, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "JPMORGAN CHASE\uff06amp;\u516c\u53f8\u540c\u610f\u8d2d\u4e70\u6570\u5b57\u8d22\u5bcc\u7ecf\u7406Nutmeg\u50a8\u84c4\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u662f\u63a8\u52a8\u5728U.K\u7684\u96f6\u552e\u94f6\u884c\u4e1a\u52a1\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002\n  \u8089\u8c46\u853b\uff0c\u6210\u7acb\u4e8e2012\u5e74\uff0c\u62e5\u6709\u8d85\u8fc7140,000\u591a\u540d\u5ba2\u6237\u548c35\u4ebf\u82f1\u9551\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e50\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u6536\u8d2d\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u672a\u62ab\u9732\uff0c\u4f46\u719f\u6089\u8be5\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u4eba\u8868\u793a\u7ea6\u4e3a10\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n  JPMORGAN\u57281\u6708\u4efd\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u5728U.K\u4e2d\u53d1\u8d77\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u94f6\u884c\u3002\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\u63d0\u4f9b\u6d88\u8d39\u94f6\u884c\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3aChase\uff0c\u5b83\u76ee\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u5728\u4eca\u5e74\u665a\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u63a8\u51fa\u4e4b\u524d\u4e0eJPMORGAN\u5458\u5de5\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\n  \u94f6\u884c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8089\u8c46\u853b\u7684\u50a8\u84c4\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u4ea7\u54c1\u4e0d\u4f1a\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u552e\u94f6\u884c\u9879\u76ee\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002\n      JPMORGAN\u6b63\u5728U.K.\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u8fdb\u5165\u62e5\u6324\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u94f6\u884c\u5e02\u573a\u3002\u76d1\u7763\u8005\u9f13\u52b1\u65b0\u7684\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5305\u62ecStarling Bank Ltd.\u548cMonzo Bank Ltd.\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u540e\u7684\u5168\u7403\u91d1\u878d\u5371\u673a\u4e4b\u540e\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ade\u4e89\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6240\u8c13\u7684\u6311\u6218\u94f6\u884c\u8feb\u4f7f\u4f20\u7edf\u8d37\u65b9\u6539\u5584\u5176\u6570\u7801\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u4f46\u52aa\u529b\u8d5a\u53d6\u5229\u6da6\u3002\n  \u636e\u719f\u6089\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53bb\u5e74\u53bb\u5e74\u53bb\u5e74\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u7531Anne Boden\u6210\u7acb\u7684\u690b\u9e1f\u94f6\u884c\u3002\n  JPMORGAN\u5148\u524d\u8bd5\u56fe\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u57ce\u5e02\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u63a8\u51fa\u6570\u5b57\u94f6\u884c\uff0c\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\u5b83\u6ca1\u6709\u8ffd\u9010\u5206\u652f\u673a\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5728\u6162\u62fe\u53d6\u540e\uff0c\u4e8e2019\u5e746\u6708\u5173\u95ed\u4e86\u82ac\u6069\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u3002\u94f6\u884c\u7ba1\u7406\u4eba\u5458\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4ece\u8be5\u8ba1\u5212\u4e2d\u5b66\u5230\u4e86\u6559\u8bad\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8ffd\u9010\u54c1\u724c\u7684\u5171\u9e23\u6bd4\u65b0\u540d\u79f0\u66f4\u597d\u3002 \nNutmeg\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u5c06\u8d22\u5bcc\u7ba1\u7406\u66f4\u52a0\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u5728\u4e00\u4efd\u58f0\u660e\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u3002 \u8089\u8c46\u853b\u88ab\u9009\u4e3a\u540d\u79f0\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9999\u6599\uff0c\u5982\u8d22\u5bcc\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u66fe\u7ecf\u7f55\u89c1\uff0c\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53ef\u7528\u3002  \u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6295\u8d44\u7ad9\u70b9\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u5b83\u9500\u552e\u83b7\u5f97\u8d44\u91d1\uff0cETF\u548c\u517b\u8001\u91d1\u3002 Nutmeg\u4e0a\u8bc9\u6295\u8d44\u65b0\u624b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u672f\u8bed\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5de5\u5177\u548cQ\uff06amp;\u5173\u4e8e\u91d1\u878d\u4e16\u754c\u7684INS\u548c\u51fa\u5c40\u3002  \u672c\u516c\u53f82019\u5e74\u7684\u6536\u5165\u589e\u957f\u4e8629\uff05\u81f3\u4e0a\u4e00\u5e74\u7684930\u4e07\u82f1\u9551\uff0c\u5176\u635f\u5931\u589e\u52a0\u4e8615\uff05\u301c2120\u4e07\u82f1\u9551\u3002 \u5176\u80a1\u4e1c\u5c06\u5728\u8be5\u4ea4\u6613\u4e2d\u4e70\u51fa\u6765\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9ad8\u76db\u96c6\u56e2\u548c\u65bd\u7f57\u5fb7\u65af\u00b7\u666e\u5c14\uff08Schroders Plc\uff09\u3002  \u51fa\u73b0\u57282021\u5e746\u670818\u65e5\uff0c\u6253\u5370\u7248\u4f5c\u4e3a\uff06\uff0339;

A price for the acquisition wasn\u2019t disclosed but people familiar with the transaction said it was about $1 billion.\n  JPMorgan said in January it would  launch a new digital bank in the U.K., offering consumer banking services there for the first time. Called Chase, it is currently being tested internally with JPMorgan employees ahead of a public launch later this year.\n  Nutmeg\u2019s savings and investment products won\u2019t initially be offered through the retail banking project, the bank said.\n      JPMorgan is entering a crowded digital banking marketplace in the U.K. Regulators encouraged new startups, including Starling Bank Ltd. and Monzo Bank Ltd., to boost competition in the wake of the last global financial crisis. These so-called challenger banks have forced traditional lenders to improve their digital offerings but have struggled to earn profits.\n  JPMorgan last year considered making a bid for Starling Bank, founded by Anne Boden in 2014, according to people familiar with the situation.\n  JPMorgan previously tried to launch a digital bank in U.S. cities and markets where it didn\u2019t have Chase branches, but closed the product, called Finn, in June 2019 after slow pickup. Bank executives have said they learned lessons from that program, including that the Chase brand resonated better than a new name.\n  Nutmeg aims to make wealth management more accessible through the internet, Neil Alexander, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. Nutmeg was chosen as a name because the spice, like wealth and investment services, was once rare and costly but is now widely available.\n  Like other investment sites, it sells access to funds, ETFs and pensions. Nutmeg appeals to investment novices, avoids jargon and provides tools and Q&amp;As about the ins and outs of the finance world.\n  The company\u2019s revenue grew 29% in 2019 to \u00a39.3 million from the previous year, and its loss increased 15% to \u00a321.2 million.

Brand safety has been a real concern for advertisers and their clients for the last few years. It\u2019s been top of mind as more search marketers are finding their ad content served up next to negative, fake, and downright spammy sites. Google\u2019s own 2020 Ad Safety Report focused on sensitivity \u201cto brands\u2019 need for control over where their ads displayed as there were increases in hate speech and calls to violence online,\u201d  we wrote earlier this year. But this new data indicates that unless advertisers are paying careful attention to their  exclusion lists, there\u2019s a chance that they could be showing up next to fake news and misleading content online.\n       Carolyn Lyden serves as the Director of Search Content for Search Engine Land and SMX.

"note_en": "Futures for July delivery ended Tuesday at $1,009.90 per thousand board feet, down 41% from the record of $1,711.20 reached in early May. Futures have declined 14 of the past 16 trading days.\n  Cash lumber prices are also crashing. Pricing service Random Lengths said Friday that its framing composite index, which tracks on-the-spot sales, dropped $122 to $1,324, its biggest ever weekly decline. The pullback came just six weeks after the index rose $124 during the first week of May, its most on record. Random Lengths described a chaotic rout in which sawmill managers struggled to provide customers with price quotes. It said late Tuesday that its index had dropped another $114, to $1,210.\n  Economists and investors have wondered if sky-high prices for wood products would doom  the booming housing market. Builders raised home prices and many stopped selling houses before the studs were installed, lest they misjudge costs and sell too cheaply. Lumber became central to  the inflation debate: whether a period of runaway inflation was afoot or high prices were temporary shocks that would ease as the economy moved further from lockdown.\n    The rapid decline suggests a bubble that has burst and the question is how low lumber prices will fall. Even after tumbling, lumber futures remain nearly three times what is typical for this time of year. Lumber producers and traders expect that prices will remain relatively high due to the strong housing market, but that the supply bottlenecks and frenzied buying that characterized the economy\u2019s reopening and sent prices to multiples of the old all-time highs are winding down.\n      During the run-up, wood was hoarded by builders, retailers and others worried about running out of material during a construction season set into overdrive by low mortgage rates and federal stimulus payments.\n  \u201cEveryone was buying more than they needed,\u201d said Mike Wisnefski, a former lumber trader and chief executive of online marketplace MaterialsXchange. \u201cThere was this fear of lack of availability.\u201d\n  Now the market is being flooded by what Mr. Wisnefski calls shadow inventory as businesses that are normally big buyers, such as home builders and companies that prefabricate the trusses that hold up roofs and floors, sell from their own stockpiles.\n    Lumber producers say that prices should remain relatively high as home builders try to erase the country\u2019s deficit of housing. Mortgage-finance firm Freddie Mac estimated in April that the U.S.  is about 3.8 million houses shy of meeting demand, thanks largely to the lack of construction following the 2008 housing crash.\n  \u201cI don\u2019t think $1,000 lumber prices are the new normal,\u201d Devin Stockfish, chief executive of lumber producer  Weyerhaeuser    WY  -0.99%  , told investors at a conference last week. \u201cBut that being said, when you think about the amount of housing that we\u2019re going to have to build in the U.S. over the next three, five, 10 years, that\u2019s just a significant amount of demand for wood products.\u201d\n  At the same conference, executives from lumber producer  PotlatchDeltic    PCH  -0.40%  said they expect lumber to trade in a range of $700 to $800 through next year. That is still more than the pre-pandemic record of $639 and is based on their estimation of the price that mills in British Columbia need to break even sawing North America\u2019s most-expensive logs. Prices below that could prompt mills in Canada to dial back output or shut down, which would eventually force prices higher to meet demand, they said.\n    The stock market is assuming even lower lumber prices ahead. Analysts with BMO Capital Markets recently calculated that the share prices of three Canadian firms that have become  the biggest sawyers in the southern pinelands have priced in expectations of $447 lumber next year. That would be a little more expensive than normal, but more in line with historical prices.\n  Those firms\u2014  Interfor    IFP  -3.35%  ,  Canfor    CFPZF  -2.97%  and  West Fraser Timber    WFG  -3.18%  \u2014along with U.S. rivals Weyerhaeuser and PotlatchDeltic  have notched record profits since ramping up mills to meet an  unexpected rush of demand last summer.\n  Sawmill owners have had some of the best performing stocks of the pandemic, though all five lumber producers are down at least 9.5% over the past month.\n  A flurry of stock sales by forest-products executives last quarter suggests that those at the top of these firms believe peak lumber is in the rearview, said Ben Silverman, director of research at InsiderScore, which tracks executive stock sales and purchases.\n  What impact has the price of lumber had on your home construction or renovation project? Join the conversation below.\n  Executives at Weyerhaeuser sold $14.6 million worth of company shares last quarter, the most since the third quarter of 2016, according to InsiderScore. PotlatchDeltic executives sold $12.1 million during that time, the most since InsiderScore began keeping track in 2003. Timberland owner  Rayonier    RYN  -0.99%  also disclosed the heaviest selling by insiders in more than a decade. Rayonier doesn\u2019t own any sawmills but holds timberland in New Zealand and the Pacific Northwest, where log prices have risen along with those of lumber.

lot has been written about the six-pager and PR/FAQ so I\u2019m not going focus on document formats, but I wanted to share how our process benefits from document-based meetings.I also have identified some areas for improvement if you are looking to adopt document-based meetings for your workplace.\n I\u2019ve been wanting to write this blog post for a while and Jaana\u2019s tweet finally gave me the inspiration to share my thoughts.\n Meetings starting with silent document reading is the best idea ever. I have no idea why this isn&#39;t common practice in the industry.\n\u2014 Jaana Dogan \u30e4\u30ca \u30c9\u30ac\u30f3 (@rakyll)  March 10, 2021\n My role is a Sr. Developer Advocate within AWS Container Services so my experience may be different from other areas and roles at Amazon.A majority of my meetings start with reading a document.This takes \u201cthis meeting could have been\u2026\u201d and flips it upside down.Most of the time, if there isn\u2019t a doc there isn\u2019t a meeting.\n Depending on the meeting, the document could be a six-pager, a PR/FAQ, a one-pager about an idea, a narrative to help find a solution to a problem, or even a service review full of charts, graphs and bullet points.The document adapts to fit the audience and purpose of the meeting.\n Reading documents is so ingrained in our culture and process that our scheduling tools have check boxes to automatically create a document.If I\u2019m catching up on a new service or feature launch, I will find the document rather than emailing or calling the product manager.\n The interesting part to me isn\u2019t in the format of the document, but how it is used.Meetings start with reading.Depending on the length of the document, we\u2019ll read anywhere from ten minutes to half an hour.If the meeting has a long document (six-pagers are the longest) and many attendees, the meeting will be scheduled for enough time to read and discuss.\n Reading the doc is part of the scheduled time.I\u2019ve worked at plenty of places that I\u2019ve tried to document everything for a meeting ahead of time.I\u2019ve written well thought-out emails, shared links to documents, and written detailed wiki pages.In all of my meetings outside of Amazon I had one of three outcomes:* No one read the email/document and I had to explain everything in the meeting* Some people read the document but forgot what it said because they read it days or hours before* At least one person had a question that I could have answered via email\n Before I started at Amazon these were some of the expected benefits to reading in meetings.* All of the information for the meeting is contained in the doc* People are not expected to find their own time to read* The document is fresh in everyone\u2019s mind\n Some other benefits I\u2019ve found while putting it in practice are:* Presenters, including myself, don\u2019t have to feel nervous about presenting in front of people.* Documents help eliminate many biases, for or against, the person who wrote the document.* You read everything in your own voice and vocal communication barriers such as accents, vocal ticks, or handicaps (e.g. stuttering or hearing loss) are not present in the document.* There\u2019s no \u201ccan you see my screen\u201d, background noise, or call audio disconnects while understanding the main content for the meeting.* There\u2019s a wealth of current and past documents. Want to see what the PR/FAQ looked like for Amazon EKS or AWS Lambda? It exists.* You are not expected to retain document information outside of the meeting. Feedback and discussions happen during the meeting. Comments can be answered asynchronously. If more discussion is needed then the document will be revised and a new meeting will be scheduled to read and discuss it.* If a document is provided early and I have a conflict at the begining of the meeting I can read the document ahead of time and join the meeting 10-20 minutes late without missing anything.* Document reading from home has been a great way to get 10-20 minutes of exercise in.\n Reading docs at the beginning of meetings is a great way to squeeze in some exercise!  I&#39;m trying to make this a new habit. Even a 10 minute climb is enough to get my heart rate up.  Pay no attention to the cables \ud83d\ude48  pic.twitter.com/zyCbUczZAA\n\u2014 Justin Garrison (@rothgar)  January 15, 2021\n There are some limitations to document based meetings.The first I have noticed is if you\u2019re not a very good writer you will be at a disadvantage communicating your ideas.Amazon has a lot of internal training to help you write good Amazon documents, but even with training it still requires a good foundation.I\u2019m very thankful for my years of practice writing for  How-To Geek and   Cloud Native Infrastructure.Even with that background, my first one-pager review was intimidating.\n I\u2019ve been told \u201cif there\u2019s no document, it doesn\u2019t get done.\u201dThis includes meetings.If there\u2019s no document, we cancel the meeting.\n While documents can create a more level playing field it\u2019s also a high barrier to entry.Even for small ideas, features, or iterations the first thing you will likely need is a document.My perspective may be skewed because in my current role I don\u2019t write production service code, but I do affect features, design, and positioning of the services.I have a lot of feedback and ideas, but I don\u2019t implement them.\n The available wealth of historical documents can be enlightening to read through, but it also can be confusing to trace the lineage of a service with a plethora of documents and comments.I have caught myself more than once reading a document which I thought sounded similar to an existing service only to realize 20 minutes later the document  is for the service and I didn\u2019t look at the date of the document or I didn\u2019t know the product code name.\n I have the benefit of working with the service teams and providing direct feedback about new features and services.Most documents I read are very interesting.Many teams at Amazon don\u2019t have direct product input.However, they\u2019re still required to write documents to communicate plans with their team.Not all docs are interesting, but they are crucial to the decision making process.\n I\u2019ve said multiple times that Amazon has the foundation for a great remote-first company.The document-based process provides employees in multiple timezones the same context as someone in Seattle.The discussions in meetings enable faster feedback loops, but the downside is they can limit the potential for asynchronous engagements if notes and questions aren\u2019t captured in the document.\n I\u2019ve never had the benefit of attending an Amazon meeting in person.From what I\u2019ve heard document-centered meetings have been extremely successful in transitioning to remote requirements.But the content isn\u2019t the only thing that matters.\n Amazon, like many large organizations, uses a lot of tools to communicate.It\u2019s often difficult to find documents spread across so many tools without an ability to cross search or centrally organize them.I could see how a tool like  Command E could help a lot.This can be additionally difficult with the multitude of open source and social platforms I engage with on a weekly basis.I currently have a user in 53 Slack workspaces. \ud83d\udc80\n Even with areas that could use improvement I can\u2019t think of a place I have worked that wouldn\u2019t benefit from document-based meetings.I\u2019m sure with more practice I will get better at writing with a more Amazonian style.\n I thoroughly enjoy not having to prep for meetings, because I\u2019m confident the document will give me the context I need to participate.I know the person who called the meeting invested their time so they don\u2019t waste mine.I reciprocate the same thoughtfulness with meetings I create and documents I write.", "posttime": "2021-06-18

", "note_en": "Unfortunately, many comments are not particularly helpful. The most common reason is that comments repeat the code: all of the information in the comment can easily be deduced from the code next to the comment.\n  // Add a horizontal scroll barhScrollBar = new JScrollBar(scrollBar, HORIZONTAL);add(hScrollBar, BorderLayout.SOUTH);// Add a vertical scroll barvScrollBar = new JScrollBar(JScrollBar.VERTICAL);add(vScrollBar, BorderLayout.EAST);// Initialize the caret-position related valuescaretX = 0;caretY = 0;caretMemX = null;\n The argument against comments like these is that they are \u201cat the same level of detail\u201d as the code itself. The code is clear in its intention, therefore the comments are redundant.\n John goes on to state that, to be useful, comments should provide a level detail not deducible from the code:\n Comments augment the code by providing information at a different level of detail. Some comments provide information at a lower, more detailed, level than the code; these comments add  precision by clarifying the exact meaning of the code. Other comments provide information at a higher, more abstract, level than the code; these comments offer  intuition, such as the reasoning behind the code, or a simpler and more abstract way of thinking about the code.\n I think this is a very fair and rationale explanation around what makes comments in code useful or not.\n  If somebody says a comment isn\u2019t adding any value, I would ask: to whom?\n Personally, I\u2019ve never liked the advice that writing obvious comments is bad practice\u2014probably because I write obvious comments all the time.\n Comments which are at the same level of detail as the code may not be useful to you as a fluent reader and writer of code, but they are to someone like me who is still figuring out how to read and write code. I find them useful as I  write code because they allow me to state my intention (in plain English), translate it to code, then compare statements and see how well I\u2019ve achieved my goal.\n Granted, if you\u2019re collaborating with a team of people then you have to figure out how to write code together. And that might mean compromising and cutting out comments that are helpful to you but distracting to others (you can always do that at the end of your process of authoring the code).\n Maybe this is an obvious statement, but if writing \u201cuseless\u201d code comments helps you, then they are not  useless. They\u2019re the opposite:  useful.\n It reminds me of when I learned Spanish. People always said, \u201cdon\u2019t do translation word for word in your head. Let the words mean what they mean in their natural language.\u201d Yet this is precisely what I would do when I first learned the language:\n  Eventually I became fluent enough where I didn\u2019t need to do this manual, step-by-step, line-by-line translation in my head. Words had their own meaning in their own language. At that point, I realized it was useless (for me) to translate into English in my head.\n  // What is your name?\u00bfComo te llamas?// My name is JimMe llamo Jim.// Where is the library?\u00bfDonde esta la biblioteca?\n Given what people say about code comments, you might think comments like these are useless. From John\u2019s book:\n Could someone who has never seen the code write the comment just by looking at the code next to the comment? If the answer is yes...then the comment doesn&#39;t make the code any easier to understand.\n Do those comments help the code become easier to understand? Well, that depends on who you ask.\n Saying code comments are useless is a judgement from us as fluent readers of the code. It disregards the value comments have for someone less fluent than yourself who is either reading or writing code.\n If you don\u2019t consider yourself fluent, you might derive a lot of value from comments others label useless, obvious, or redundant because they help you translate something you&#39;re not that familiar with\u2014another language\u2014into something you are\u2014English, for example.\n And comments can serve a very different purpose when they\u2019re being read vs. when they\u2019re being written. Those are almost two different kinds of of activities.\n So when someone calls a particular style of code commenting useless, ask yourself: to whom?

The experience there is a big part of the draw, so his staff would only send out a few orders a day, tops, and he didn\u2019t mind partnering with companies like Seamless, he said, despite the 30 percent they\u2019d charge in fees. But once the city locked down, Fuquay did what few restaurateurs were willing to do: He cut ties with the apps. Instead, Fuquay reached out directly to customers, put flyers in people\u2019s takeout orders asking them not to use the apps, and retrained service staff so they could do delivery work.\n  Yet the Grubhub orders kept coming. So did Postmates. Fuquay didn\u2019t work with them in any official way; they simply put his restaurant on the site, and picked up orders and delivered them. Not only were they still charging his customers fees; they were using old menus, promising customers meals he hadn\u2019t made in years, like duck breast in mole sauce. That led to confused and upset customers, negative reviews, and a general frustration that tech giants are gaining from his business and leaving him with little to show for it. \u201cIt\u2019s misrepresenting my business to the public,\u201d Fuquay said. \u201cWhat I lose is the ability to control the transaction with the customer, the ability to market my own current menu and my own current prices, and to resolve any issues that come up.\u201d He tried calling them time and time again, but the response, he said, has been the same: \u201cCrickets.\u201d\n  Now, New York is on the verge of allowing restaurants like the Queensboro to have more control over their own deliveries. Mark Gjonaj, a Bronx City Council member and chair of the Committee on Small Business, is set to introduce a new bill on Thursday that would make it illegal for third-party delivery companies to add restaurants to their apps without explicit permission \u2014\u00a0and would fine the companies as much as $1,000 a day, per restaurant, for violating those terms, according to a version of the bill obtained by Curbed. \u201cOften in cases where a restaurant doesn\u2019t want to be included on a third-party marketplace, it\u2019s because they lose quality control on the food, and they give up having a direct relationship with their own customers \u2014 both put restaurants in a no-win situation,\u201d Gjonaj told Curbed. \u201cNow more than ever, locally owned restaurants should be able to control their business and how it operates. If they want to sign up for a delivery service, then great. If they don\u2019t, they shouldn\u2019t have to grovel to tech companies and hope to be taken off of a platform that may be harmful to their business.\u201d\n  The law, should it pass, would potentially double penalties imposed by a state  bill from Staten Island state senator Diane Savino that nixes the practice statewide. The state bill, which passed both legislative houses in May and will go to the governor for review in the next few weeks, also allows restaurants to pursue legal action against third-party delivery companies for adding them. And it\u2019s coming as city lawmakers are looking to redouble their efforts to rein in the middleman apps, just as restaurants that survived the pandemic are able to return at full capacity. \u201cWith the struggles that restaurants have faced over the last year, this legislation will help ensure that they are not taken advantage of,\u201d Senator Savino said. Surreptitiously adding restaurants has been a delivery  practice for years. DoorDash and Postmates, now owned by Uber, were exemplars of the practice, and used it to fuel their Silicon Valley\u2013style growth. Seamless, the parent company of Grubhub, soon  followed suit, adding hundreds of thousands of restaurants in a race for market domination. While the growth has been undeniable \u2014\u00a0especially during the pandemic \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s still a generally  unprofitable industry.\n  By the time the pandemic started in\u00a0March 2020, tension had been building for years between New York City\u2019s restaurant industry and these tech-enabled delivery companies.\u00a0Seamless and DoorDash, they complained, charged extremely high fees, discouraged indoor dining \u2014\u00a0where restaurateurs typically make more per meal \u2014\u00a0and actually made it  more confusing than before for some customers. By May, just a few weeks into the lockdown, the City Council had passed a suite of emergency laws temporarily capping fees and reining in their ability to charge commissions for orders made through their phone systems\u2014\u00a0a situation that\u2019s had the potential to\u00a0 cost restaurants thousands of dollars extra a month. Those bills expire this August, and Gjonaj\u2019s office is planning on holding a hearing later this month to discuss making them permanent as well as making phone-ordering fees more  transparent. \u201cMy colleagues and I are currently considering whether it is needed to temporarily extend, make permanent, or allow the laws to sunset,\u201d Gjonaj said.\n  The reaction from delivery companies has been mixed. Uber declined to comment. DoorDash had already  announced in November that it was ending the practice of adding restaurants to the platform without their explicit permission, though it\u00a0has retained the ones that it already listed, according to a person familiar with the business. \u201cWe\u2019re proud that the odds of staying in business during the pandemic are eight times better for restaurants on DoorDash, and we commend efforts to support local merchants and ensure that they are heard,\u201d a DoorDash spokeswoman said.\n  Grubhub, which started adding these so-called non-partner restaurants only in 2019, didn\u2019t directly address questions about the new bills, but said it\u2019s\u00a0 supportive of local restaurants that want out. \u201cWe\u2019re developing tools that make it easier for restaurants to claim their menus or request to be removed from our platform, and if a restaurant would not like to be included on Grubhub, they can reach out to us at  restaurants@grubhub.com,\u201d a company spokesman said.\n  New York has generally been among the most aggressive states in pushing back against the delivery companies. While the restaurant industry has been battered by the pandemic \u2014\u00a0Andrew Rigie, executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, told Curbed  that there are still about 130,000 fewer jobs in the city \u2014  lawmakers have been more receptive to getting them back. \u201cWe need to have penalties for non-compliance,\u201d Rigie said.\u00a0\u201cMany of these are billion-dollar corporations. We\u2019ve seen they are willing to exploit local restaurants, they try to creatively wiggle around laws so they don\u2019t impact them, and even in cases when laws are in effect, they willfully break them.\u201d Fuquay said that while the Queensboro has been able to rally its customers to support it, not every restaurant would be able to pull that off. \u201cSome restaurants feel trapped, and those restaurants are usually the least well-resourced,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve connected the dots in a way that a lot of restaurants don\u2019t have the resources to do, and they\u2019re being exploited by these companies.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-18 08:12:15", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6551\u63f4,finally,rigie", "title": "\u9910\u9986\u7ec8\u4e8e\u53ef\u80fd\u6551\u63f4Grubhub\u548cUber\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6ce8\u518c ", "title_en": "Restaurants May Finally Get Relief from Grubhub and Uber\u2019s Automatic Sign-Ups", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.curbed.com/2021/06/uber-grubhub-seamless-apps-restaurants-automatically-added-illegal-nyc.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6551\u63f4", "finally", "rigie"]}]
