While many — if not most — of us are motivated by genuine caring for the people who power our organizations, we also intuitively know that employee happiness should boost job performance. Still, two nagging questions remain: Which comes first, succeeding and then being happy, or being happy and then succeeding? And just how  much does initial happiness matter?</p><p>在全球大流行期间工作对员工的工作满意度和情感幸福感造成的损失，让企业领导人前所未有地专注于培养员工的幸福感。虽然我们中的许多人——如果不是大多数人的话——都是出于对为我们的组织提供动力的人的真诚关怀，但我们也直觉地知道，员工的幸福感应该会提高工作绩效。尽管如此，仍然有两个棘手的问题：先成功后快乐，还是先快乐后成功？最初的幸福有多重要？</p><p> The results of our recent research, published in the  Journal of Happiness Studies, have gotten us one big step closer to answering those two questions. For our study, we followed almost 1 million U.S. Army soldiers for nearly five years. We first asked them to rate their well-being — their happiness, if you will — along with their optimism, and then tracked which soldiers later received awards based on their job performance. We collected our data in the midst of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, so the stakes were high: Some of those awards were for exemplary assigned job performance, while others were earned for extraordinary performance in heroic actions. Receiving an award in the Army, either for exemplary job performance or for heroism, is a relatively rare event. Of the nearly 1 million soldiers in our sample, only 12% received an award of any type during the five years that we ran the study.</p><p>我们最近发表在《幸福研究杂志》上的研究结果使我们离回答这两个问题又近了一大步。在我们的研究中，我们对近100万美国陆军士兵进行了近五年的跟踪调查。我们首先让他们对自己的幸福感——如果你愿意的话——以及乐观情绪进行评分，然后根据他们的工作表现跟踪哪些士兵后来获得了奖励。我们是在伊拉克和阿富汗战争期间收集数据的，因此风险很高：其中一些奖项是为了表彰出色的分配工作表现，而另一些则是为了表彰英勇行为的非凡表现。在军队中，无论是因为出色的工作表现还是英雄主义而获奖，都是相对罕见的事件。在我们样本中的近100万名士兵中，只有12%在我们开展这项研究的五年内获得了任何类型的奖励。</p><p> Monthly research-based updates on what the future of work means for your workplace, teams, and culture.</p><p>每月基于研究的更新，了解工作的未来对你的工作场所、团队和文化意味着什么。</p><p> While we expected that well-being and optimism would matter to performance, we were taken aback by just how much they mattered. We saw four times as many awards earned by the initially happiest soldiers (upper quartile) compared with those who were unhappiest initially (lower quartile) — a huge difference in performance between those groups. This gap held when we accounted for status (officers versus enlisted soldiers), gender, race, education, and other demographic characteristics. 1 In fact, happiness — and, to a somewhat lesser extent, optimism — were better predictors of awards than any demographic factor we examined.</p><p>虽然我们预计幸福和乐观会对业绩产生影响，但他们的重要性让我们大吃一惊。我们看到，最初最快乐的士兵（上四分之一）获得的奖项是最初最不快乐的士兵（下四分之一）获得的奖项的四倍——这两组士兵在表现上存在巨大差异。当我们考虑身份（军官与应征士兵）、性别、种族、教育和其他人口特征时，这种差距就存在了。1事实上，与我们研究的任何人口统计学因素相比，幸福感——以及在某种程度上较小的乐观主义——是更好的奖项预测因素。</p><p> You might dismiss these results if you believe that military data somehow doesn’t apply to the business world, but you would be wrong to do so. After all, the U.S. Department of Defense is the single largest employer in the world, dwarfing Walmart by nearly 1 million employees. It has nearly $3 trillion in total assets (compared with Walmart’s $236 billion) and maintains over $290 billion in inventory (compared with Walmart’s $44 billion). The U.S. military is not just “big business”; it is, in fact, the biggest business by an order of magnitude, so what we learn from the military can and often does apply to the business world. There are over 190 distinct job categories in the Army — from clerk to pilot, cook to commander — and most were included in our data.</p><p>如果你认为军事数据在某种程度上不适用于商业世界，你可能会忽略这些结果，但这样做是错误的。毕竟，美国国防部是世界上最大的单一雇主，比沃尔玛少了近100万名员工。它拥有近3万亿美元的总资产（相比沃尔玛的2360亿美元），库存超过2900亿美元（相比沃尔玛的440亿美元）。美国军队不仅仅是“大企业”；事实上，它是一个数量级上最大的企业，因此我们从军队中学到的东西可以而且经常适用于商业世界。军队中有190多个不同的工作类别——从文员到飞行员，从厨师到指挥官——大多数都包含在我们的数据中。</p><p> In short, not only do happiness and optimism matter to employee performance, but they matter a lot, and both  predict how well employees will do. Our military research, along with other behavioral science research spanning the past 40 years, highlights the competitive advantage that employee happiness offers businesses. There are some things about employee happiness that every business leader should know and be able to apply. And, as we emerge from a demoralizing global pandemic, we would all do well to take stock of how to influence the happiness and optimism of those around us in the workplace.</p><p>简言之，快乐和乐观不仅对员工的表现很重要，而且非常重要，它们都能预测员工的表现。我们的军事研究，以及过去40年的其他行为科学研究，突显了员工幸福感为企业带来的竞争优势。关于员工幸福感，每个企业领导者都应该知道并能够运用一些东西。而且，随着我们从一场士气低落的全球流行病中走出来，我们都应该好好审视一下如何影响我们周围工作场所的人的幸福和乐观。</p><p> That raises the question, what really is happiness? The behavioral science literature often refers to happiness as  subjective well-being because the meaning of happiness varies in different contexts. As with most concepts that emerge from psychology, definitions vary, but when it comes to happiness, they generally coalesce around three areas: a person’s own assessment of their satisfaction with life; how much positive emotion (such as enjoyment, enthusiasm, inspiration, or pride) they experience; and how little negative emotion (such as hostility, irritability, fear, or nervousness) they experience. 2 We combined these three to yield our measure of happiness.</p><p>这就提出了一个问题，幸福到底是什么？行为科学文献通常将幸福称为主观幸福，因为幸福的含义在不同的语境中有所不同。与心理学中出现的大多数概念一样，定义各不相同，但当涉及到幸福时，它们通常集中在三个方面：一个人对自己生活满意度的评估；他们经历了多少积极情绪（如享受、热情、灵感或自豪感）；以及他们经历的负面情绪（如敌意、易怒、恐惧或紧张）有多少。我们将这三者结合起来，得出我们的幸福指数。</p><p>  Since the advent of positive psychology in 2000, there has been a tremendous amount of research in the field, with well-being mentioned in over 170,000 academic articles. 3 Some of that work has found that there is truth to the perception that some people just seem happier, and researchers have looked closely at heritability (factors we’re born with) and how our environment shapes our happiness. If we think of general happiness as a pie, then the research suggests that heritability accounts for about 40% of that pie while 60% is attributed to other factors, especially life experiences. Nearly the same can be said for the workplace: In a recent long-term study, researchers found that while heritability accounted for about 30% of job satisfaction at age 21, the importance of heritability dropped to less than 20% when measured again at ages 25 and 30. Thus, environmental factors within the workplace become  more important over time. 4</p><p>自2000年积极心理学问世以来，该领域已有大量研究，超过17万篇学术文章提到了幸福感。3其中一些研究发现，有些人似乎更快乐的看法是正确的，研究人员仔细研究了遗传力（我们与生俱来的因素）以及我们的环境如何塑造我们的快乐。如果我们把总体幸福视为一个馅饼，那么研究表明，遗传力约占馅饼的40%，而60%归因于其他因素，尤其是生活经历。在工作场所也是如此：在最近的一项长期研究中，研究人员发现，虽然遗传力在21岁时占工作满意度的30%左右，但在25岁和30岁时再次测量时，遗传力的重要性降至不到20%。因此，随着时间的推移，工作场所内的环境因素变得更加重要。4.</p><p> The relative importance of some of those environmental factors has shifted recently. The “World Happiness Report 2021” noted that within the workplace, happiness before the pandemic was largely due to employees’ sense of belonging within an organization and among coworkers, the flexibility afforded to workers, inclusivity, and a sense of purpose to their work (in descending order of importance). 5 Things changed dramatically during the pandemic: Having a supportive manager became the largest predictor of happiness — nearly twice as important as the next ranked workplace happiness factor, purpose.</p><p>其中一些环境因素的相对重要性最近发生了变化。《2021年世界幸福报告》（World Happiness Report 2021）指出，在工作场所，大流行前的幸福感主要是由于员工对组织和同事的归属感、员工的灵活性、包容性和工作的目的感（按重要性降序排列）。在这场大流行期间，5件事发生了巨大的变化：拥有一个支持性的管理者成为幸福感的最大预测因素——其重要性几乎是排名第二的职场幸福因素——目标——的两倍。</p><p> Not surprisingly, money matters to employee happiness too — but research has shown that is chiefly for those employees who indicated that money is important to them. In a recent study, the relationship between income and happiness was over four times greater for people who reported that money was important to them compared with those who cared much less about money. 6 Thus, for employees who aren’t driven by money, income may merely be a hollow way to keep score.</p><p>毫不奇怪，金钱对员工的幸福感也很重要——但研究表明，这主要适用于那些认为金钱对他们很重要的员工。在最近的一项研究中，与那些不太在乎金钱的人相比，那些认为金钱对他们很重要的人的收入和幸福感之间的关系要高出四倍多。6因此，对于不受金钱驱使的员工来说，收入可能只是一种空洞的记分方式。</p><p> Within the workplace, we know that happier employees are more likely to emerge as leaders, earn higher scores on performance evaluations, and tend to be better teammates. 7 We also know, based on substantial research, that happier employees are healthier, have lower rates of absenteeism, are highly motivated to succeed, are more creative, have better relationships with peers, and are less likely to leave a company. 8 All of these correlates of happiness significantly influence a company’s bottom line.</p><p>在工作场所，我们知道更快乐的员工更有可能成为领导者，在绩效评估中获得更高的分数，并且往往是更好的队友。7根据大量研究，我们还知道，更快乐的员工更健康，缺勤率更低，成功的积极性更高，更有创造力，与同事的关系更好，离开公司的可能性更小。所有这些与幸福感相关的因素都会显著影响公司的底线。</p><p> Taken together, the data indicates that there is a lot of room for leaders and organizations to influence happiness within the workplace. While happiness is influenced by heritability and drivers like finding a sense of meaning, a larger portion of the happiness pie may result from factors like workplace flexibility, reasonable pay, type of work, and managers who are supportive. That means it’s possible for leaders to shape the workplace to make happier employees.</p><p>综合来看，这些数据表明，领导者和组织有很大的空间来影响工作场所的幸福感。虽然幸福感受遗传力和寻找意义等驱动因素的影响，但幸福感蛋糕的很大一部分可能来自工作场所灵活性、合理薪酬、工作类型和支持的管理者等因素。这意味着领导者有可能塑造工作场所，让员工更快乐。</p><p>    To begin, we suggest that leaders follow the science and take a structured approach to hiring for, promoting, and developing employee happiness. While the approach will vary based on organizational needs, leaders should commit to three actions.</p><p>首先，我们建议领导者遵循科学，采取结构化的方法来雇佣、提升和发展员工的幸福感。虽然这种方法会因组织需要而有所不同，但领导者应致力于三项行动。</p><p> 1. Measure happiness in both employees and job candidates. In many ways, “hiring the happy” requires a bit of perspective. While we do not believe that happiness should be placed ahead of the knowledge, skills, or talent needed for a job, we conservatively advocate using measures of happiness and optimism as discriminators, or tiebreakers, because the risks are low and the benefits could be important. It is also important to use proven assessment tools and not rely on management intuition based on an employee’s affect. Many organizations already use a variety of surveys to evaluate job candidates. Even if adding these questions about happiness and optimism to the applicant survey results in only a small increase in downstream productivity and profitability, most leaders would jump at this opportunity, because it costs almost nothing. While this will of course vary across organizations and sectors, most organizations are likely better off hiring someone who is already relatively happy and optimistic, because they will influence exceptional performance and reduce turnover. If you extrapolate our findings from the military study to a private sector context where 1,000 hires are going to be made, using well-being as a hiring criterion should lead to about 11 more exceptional performers than if the company simply hired personnel without considering well-being at all.</p><p>1.测量员工和求职者的幸福感。在很多方面，“雇佣快乐的人”需要一点视角。虽然我们不认为幸福应该放在工作所需的知识、技能或才能之前，但我们保守地主张使用幸福和乐观的衡量标准作为区分标准，或平分标准，因为风险很低，好处可能很重要。同样重要的是，使用经验证的评估工具，而不是依赖基于员工情绪的管理直觉。许多组织已经使用各种调查来评估求职者。即使将这些关于幸福和乐观的问题添加到申请者的调查中，只会导致下游生产力和盈利能力的小幅提高，大多数领导者也会欣然接受这个机会，因为它几乎不需要任何成本。当然，这在不同的组织和行业中会有所不同，但大多数组织最好雇佣一个已经相对快乐和乐观的人，因为他们会影响出色的表现，减少人员流动。如果你从军事研究中推断出我们的发现，在私营部门的情况下，将雇佣1000人，将幸福感作为雇佣标准，应该会比公司只雇佣员工而不考虑幸福感的情况下多11人。</p><p> The findings from our study are broadly applicable because the sample we used was not drawn from a specific functional area, such as salespeople or IT professionals, as is often the case in the published research on happiness in the workplace. Rather, while some soldiers in our study worked in typical Army jobs, such as those found in the infantry, many more were office workers, truck drivers, police officers, medical professionals, logistics experts, pilots, engineers, and strategists, among others. Thus, our measurement of so many professions at this scale and in a single study is unique and makes our results highly applicable to the business world. In short, happiness mattered across the work spectrum. The sample matters for other reasons, too. Because it was huge and ran for five years — at nearly 1 million people, it’s the largest long-term well-being study ever done — we could perform more detailed analyses with the data and demonstrate that the findings held true regardless of demographics, as described above.</p><p>我们的研究结果具有广泛的适用性，因为我们使用的样本并非来自特定的功能领域，如销售人员或IT专业人员，这在已发表的关于工作场所幸福感的研究中经常出现。相反，虽然我们研究中的一些士兵从事典型的陆军工作，比如步兵，但更多的是办公室工作人员、卡车司机、警察、医疗专业人员、后勤专家、飞行员、工程师和战略家等。因此，我们在一项研究中以这种规模对如此多的职业进行了测量，这是独一无二的，使我们的结果非常适用于商业世界。简言之，幸福感在所有工作领域都很重要。样本的重要性还有其他原因。由于这项研究规模巨大，历时五年——近100万人，是有史以来规模最大的长期幸福感研究——我们可以对数据进行更详细的分析，并证明无论人口统计数据如何，这些发现都是正确的，如上所述。</p><p> Unlike most research studies, ours did not simply examine performance in the aggregate. Rather, we examined the influence of happiness on  exceptional performance, given that we homed in on only 12% of our total sample — those who had received an award for their exemplary performance at work. Unhappy soldiers did earn performance and heroism awards, but only one-fourth as many as those who were initially happy. The implication for business is that happier employees receive a disproportionate amount of recognition for exceptional performance and become the organization’s superstars. The Pareto principle asserts that 80% of outcomes arise from 20% of causes. If we apply it to our research, we can see that using happiness and optimism (which predicted awards just about as well as happiness) to help identify, hire, and retain employees will likely lead to the emergence of a few more superstars — and will likely have a significant impact on the bottom line.</p><p>与大多数研究不同，我们的研究并不是简单地从总体上考察绩效。相反，我们考察了幸福感对卓越表现的影响，因为我们只关注了样本总数的12%——那些因在工作中表现出色而获奖的人。不快乐的士兵确实获得了表演奖和英雄主义奖，但只有最初快乐士兵的四分之一。这对企业来说意味着，更快乐的员工会因为出色的表现而获得不成比例的认可，并成为企业的超级明星。帕累托原理认为80%的结果来自20%的原因。如果我们把它应用到我们的研究中，我们可以看到，用幸福和乐观（它预测的奖项和幸福感差不多）来帮助识别、雇佣和留住员工，很可能会导致更多的超级明星出现，并且可能会对底线产生重大影响。</p><p> Finally, the awards included in the study varied in type, organizational meaning, and impact level, demonstrating that the link between happiness and performance held for many different kinds of accomplishments. The rigorous scrutiny and documentation that precedes the bestowing of a military award further strengthens the case for these awards as highly reliable indicators of performance. And, perhaps most important, none of the earned awards were tied to monetary compensation. In the U.S. Army, if you earn a Silver Star for heroism in combat or a Meritorious Service Medal for successfully leading a training battalion, you don’t get a $10,000 bonus. In other words, the awards reflect performance driven by intrinsic motivation, not by explicitly extrinsic financial rewards.</p><p>最后，研究中包括的奖项在类型、组织意义和影响程度上各不相同，这表明幸福感和绩效之间的联系适用于许多不同类型的成就。授予军事奖项之前的严格审查和文件记录进一步加强了这些奖项作为高度可靠的绩效指标的理由。而且，也许最重要的是，所有获得的奖项都与金钱补偿无关。在美国陆军，如果你因战斗中的英雄主义获得银星，或因成功领导一个训练营而获得功勋奖章，你不会获得1万美元奖金。换句话说，奖励反映的是内在动机驱动的绩效，而不是明确的外在经济奖励。</p><p> Though the biggest accomplishment of this study might be linking happiness to exemplary performance, it also replicates several findings from previous research. While replication may not be headline grabbing and is rarely rewarded in academia, it is foundational to science. At this moment, the behavioral science field is facing a crisis in replication, calling into question the validity of many long-standing leadership, management, and behavioral theories that are taught at most MBA programs. Indeed, the Open Science Collaboration found in 2015 that less than 40% of seminal behavioral science experiments could be replicated. i Conversely, our findings are highly accurate, represent long-term results, and encompass many jobs.</p><p>尽管这项研究最大的成就可能是将幸福感与模范表现联系起来，但它也复制了之前研究的一些发现。虽然复制可能不会吸引眼球，在学术界也很少得到奖励，但它是科学的基础。此时此刻，行为科学领域正面临复制危机，这让人们对大多数MBA课程教授的许多长期存在的领导力、管理和行为理论的有效性产生了质疑。事实上，开放科学合作组织在2015年发现，只有不到40%的开创性行为科学实验可以复制。相反，我们的研究结果非常准确，代表了长期结果，涵盖了许多工作。</p><p> Beyond hiring, employee happiness should also be a consideration when measuring organizational performance. Yes, objective performance still matters greatly. But, while a high-performing division within a company may bring short-term profit, if that performance was driven by toxic leadership and management practices, then those profits could evaporate quickly if employees were to leave in response. Unwarranted attrition is expensive. The U.S. military, for example, has caught on to this and has fired commanding officers who have fostered poor organizational climates, and at times it has done so preemptively, before a catastrophic event could occur. After all, it costs several hundred thousand dollars and years of effort to recruit and train a nuclear reactor engineer, and much more to do the same for an aviator. Losing even a few to unhappiness borne from toxic leadership is expensive and creates personnel shortages that increase the risk to those who remain. Attrition and talent shortages in a corporation have similar negative effects. Thus, we advocate treating happiness as an objective performance outcome of the organization, as well as a leading indicator of leadership success. In our study, we used one of the gold-standard measures of well-being, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), which has been used in thousands of published studies to examine happiness in a variety of contexts. It takes about 10 minutes to complete it. 9</p><p>在衡量组织绩效时，除了雇佣，员工幸福感也应该是一个考虑因素。是的，客观表现仍然很重要。但是，尽管公司内部的高绩效部门可能会带来短期利润，但如果这种业绩是由有害的领导和管理做法驱动的，那么如果员工因此离职，这些利润可能会迅速蒸发。不必要的损耗是昂贵的。例如，美国军方已经意识到了这一点，并解雇了造成恶劣组织环境的指挥官，有时甚至在灾难性事件发生之前先发制人地这样做。毕竟，招募和培训一名核反应堆工程师需要花费数十万美元和多年的努力，而为一名飞行员做同样的事情需要花费更多的时间。即使是少数人也会因为有毒领导层带来的不满而失去工作，代价高昂，还会造成人员短缺，增加留守人员的风险。公司的人员流失和人才短缺也有类似的负面影响。因此，我们提倡将快乐视为组织的客观绩效结果，以及领导成功的首要指标。在我们的研究中，我们使用了幸福感的金标准测量方法之一，即积极和消极情绪量表（PANAS），该量表已在数千项已发表的研究中使用，用于在各种背景下检验幸福感。完成它大约需要10分钟。9</p><p> 2. Develop happiness in your workforce. Given all the training and development requirements placed on most organizations, the thought of actively trying to develop happier employees may initially seem daunting, time consuming, and expensive. However, the academic literature repeatedly shows that training initiatives targeting employee well-being do not require a significant time investment, are cost effective, and carry a high ROI.</p><p>2.培养员工的幸福感。考虑到大多数组织的所有培训和发展要求，积极尝试培养更快乐的员工的想法最初可能看起来令人望而生畏、耗时且昂贵。然而，学术文献反复表明，以员工福祉为目标的培训计划不需要大量时间投入，具有成本效益，且具有较高的投资回报率。</p><p> Here are three examples of simple exercises, each backed by rigorous evidence of effectiveness. In the first, the Gratitude Visit, participants prepare and present a 300-word testimony of gratitude to someone who changed their life for the better. In the second, Three Good Things, participants write down three things that went well each day and what caused those things to go well, for one week. The third, Using Signature Strengths in a New Way, calls on participants to complete an online strengths survey and then use one of their top strengths in a new way each day for at least a week. Research testing these approaches found that the Three Good Things and Signature Strengths exercises significantly increased happiness and decreased depression over six months, while Gratitude Visit did the same over one month. 10 Of course, such workplace happiness initiatives work best when people  want to become happier, are willing to put some effort into the process, and believe that those efforts will pay dividends. 11 That aside, the costs are quite low, the interventions can occur at any level of an organization, and they don’t require outside consultants.</p><p>这里有三个简单练习的例子，每一个都有有效性的有力证据支持。在第一次感恩访问中，参与者准备并向那些改变了他们生活的人表达300字的感激之情。在第二个“三件好事”中，参与者在一周内写下每天进展顺利的三件事以及导致这些事情进展顺利的原因。第三，以新的方式使用标志性优势，要求参与者完成一项在线优势调查，然后每天以新的方式使用其中一项优势，至少持续一周。对这些方法进行测试的研究发现，在六个月的时间里，这三件好事和标志性的力量练习显著增加了幸福感，减少了抑郁，而感恩访问在一个月的时间里效果相同。10当然，当人们想要变得更快乐，愿意在这个过程中付出一些努力，并且相信这些努力会带来回报时，这样的工作场所幸福倡议最有效。11除此之外，成本非常低，干预可以发生在组织的任何级别，并且不需要外部顾问。</p><p> For organizations willing to make a larger investment, there are of course turnkey, validated programs shown to improve employee well-being. During the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, for example, the U.S. Army invested heavily in resilience initiatives such as Comprehensive Soldier Fitness, which was demonstrated to improve the psychological health of service members. 12 The program included extensive training for a large cadre of instructors, resulting in an overall ratio of about 1 trainer for every 100 service members. 13 Likewise, the Enduring Happiness and Continued Self-Enhancement (ENHANCE) program was shown to improve happiness, with effects lasting for over six months. ENHANCE is a 24-hour training package that can be delivered in person or online and focuses on identifying core values, cultivating mindfulness, establishing positive social relationships, dealing with negativity and adversity, and other areas. 14</p><p>对于愿意进行更大投资的组织来说，当然也有经过验证的交钥匙项目，可以改善员工福利。例如，在伊拉克和阿富汗战争最激烈的时期，美国陆军在恢复能力方面投入了大量资金，如士兵全面健身，这被证明可以改善服役人员的心理健康。12该计划包括对大批教员进行广泛培训，从而使每100名服务人员中约有一名教员。13同样，持久幸福和持续自我提升（ENHANCE）计划也被证明能改善幸福感，效果持续六个月以上。ENHANCE是一个24小时的培训包，可以亲自或在线提供，重点是确定核心价值观、培养正念、建立积极的社会关系、应对消极和逆境，以及其他领域。14</p><p> Our recommendation: First, measure well-being. Next, start with the easy exercises to demonstrate that the company values employee well-being. Then start investing in the more formal programs over time as happiness increases.</p><p>我们的建议：首先，衡量幸福感。接下来，从简单的练习开始，展示公司重视员工福利。然后随着幸福感的增加，开始投资更正式的项目。</p><p>  3. Retain employees who are happy. The pandemic has reminded us of some tough realities, namely that organizations can contract in turbulent times just as fast as they expand when the economy is booming. Clearly, our military study shows that organizations should  want happy employees, because they perform significantly better than those who are unhappy. But it turns out that organizations also need happy employees, because happiness is in fact  contagious. For example, researchers examined 20 years of data from 4,700 participants in the long-running Framingham Heart Study and discovered not only that happiness can spread across a social network, but also that happy people are much more connected to other happy people within the network. Perhaps the most striking finding of this study was that the effect of happiness extended for three degrees of separation from the focal person (so, friends of their friends’ friends). 15 Another important finding from this study is that like happiness,  unhappiness is also contagious. This contagion effect places leaders in a precarious position, especially if they are presented with the difficult scenario of being able to retain only one of two employees. With performance and other factors held constant, they should keep the one who is happiest.</p><p>3.留住快乐的员工。这场大流行提醒我们一些严峻的现实，即组织在动荡时期收缩的速度与经济繁荣时扩张的速度一样快。显然，我们的军事研究表明，组织应该想要快乐的员工，因为他们的表现要比那些不快乐的员工好得多。但事实证明，组织也需要快乐的员工，因为快乐其实是有传染性的。例如，研究人员对长期参与弗雷明翰心脏病研究的4700名参与者的20年数据进行了研究，发现快乐不仅可以在社交网络中传播，而且快乐的人与社交网络中其他快乐的人的联系要多得多。也许这项研究最惊人的发现是，幸福感的影响延伸到与焦点人物（朋友的朋友的朋友）的三个分离度。15这项研究的另一个重要发现是，与快乐一样，不快乐也会传染。这种传染效应使领导者处于不稳定的境地，尤其是当他们面临着只能留住两名员工中的一名的困难情况时。在保持表现和其他因素不变的情况下，他们应该保持最快乐的人。</p><p>  Our work with the Army over the past decade consistently uncovered a foundational truth: Employee well-being initiatives work best when confident leaders present the material and when senior leaders place significant emphasis on the overall effort. 16 Thus, leaders must be willing to invest their efforts into making the initiatives successful by not only advocating for them — for example, by securing resources for a program and promoting positive strategic messaging — but also by participating in the training and incorporating it into their own behaviors. If leaders want to improve employee happiness, they must model that which is taught so that it becomes integral to the organization’s lexicon and culture. We learn best by watching others, so let your employees learn to be happy by watching you.</p><p>在过去十年中，我们与军队的合作始终揭示了一个基本真理：当自信的领导者展示材料时，当高级领导者非常重视整体工作时，员工福利计划最有效。16因此，领导者必须愿意投入自己的努力，使这些举措取得成功，不仅要为这些举措进行宣传——例如，为一个项目争取资源，促进积极的战略信息传递——还要参与培训，并将其融入到自己的行为中。如果领导者想要提高员工的幸福感，他们必须对所教内容进行建模，使其成为组织词汇和文化的组成部分。我们通过观察他人学习得最好，所以让你的员工通过观察你学习快乐。</p><p>        1.
