Thorp developed, through maths, a strategy for blackjack that reversed the house&#39;s advantage and allowed the player to make money reliably. Prior to publishing the details of his system in   Beat the Dealer he travelled to Las Vegas to try out the system for real - and make a bit of cash on the side. He made some profit but found that his system mysteriously didn&#39;t work as well as it should have done.</p><p>Edward O. Thorp通过数学开发了一个黑人策略，这是逆转房子的策略＆＃39;虽然玩家可靠地赚钱。在发布他的系统的细节之前，在击败经销商之前，他前往拉斯维加斯试用了真实的系统 - 并在侧面制作一点现金。他赚了一些利润，但发现他的系统神秘地没有工作，也是应该做的。</p><p>  Thorp had naively assumed that casinos would play fair. In fact, his croupiers cheated him, dealing duff hands to limit his success. It was only later when he returned to Vegas with a two  professional  magicians that he could detect sharp practice from croupiers (and change table) that he made money in earnest.</p><p>  索普天真地假设赌场会扮演公平。事实上，他的屁股欺骗了他，打造棘手的手来限制他的成功。当他返回拉斯维加斯时，他只有两个专业的魔术师才能发现他可以获得认真赚钱的屁股（和改变桌）的急剧做法。</p><p>  I think if an expert with a secret breakthrough can get cheated at his own game then probably anyone can. Thorp had utterly cracked the  logical part of casino blackjack: making optimal choices. The bit he&#39;d missed was the  finesse part: that croupiers were very good at what is now called  &#34;close-up magic&#34;, more than neutering the advantage of his systematic optimal play.</p><p>  我认为如果一个专家突破的专家可以在他自己的游戏中被骗，然后可能有任何人可以。索普已经完全破解了赌场二十一点的逻辑部分：做出最佳选择。钻头＆＃39; d错过了这一消息：那个屁股非常擅长现在被称为＃34;特写魔法＆＃34;，比绝育的优势在于他系统的最佳戏剧。</p><p>  I think many popular scams have a  logical part and a  finesse part. You need both to reliably deceive people. Three examples, from the smallest tricks to the grossest frauds:</p><p>  我认为很多流行的骗局都有一个逻辑部分和一个技巧部分。你需要两者都可以可靠地欺骗人。三个例子，从最小的技巧到最大的欺诈：</p><p>    Probably the most famous &#34;trick&#34; of all is the  Monty Hall problem, which comes from a 1960s American gameshow. Here&#39;s a the description:</p><p>    可能是最着名的＆＃34;诀窍＆＃34;总而言之，来自20世纪60年代美国的Gameshow。在这里＆＃39;描述：</p><p>  Suppose you&#39;re on a game show, and you&#39;re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what&#39;s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, &#34;Do you want to pick door No. 2?&#34; Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?</p><p>  假设你＆＃39;在游戏节目中，你＆＃39;重新选择三个门：一扇门后面是一辆车;在其他人身后，山羊。你挑选一扇门，说1号和主持人，谁知道门后面的东西，打开另一扇门，说3，有一个山羊。然后他对你说，＆＃34;你想选择第2号门吗？＆＃34;切换您的选择是否有优势？</p><p>  The answer, now fairly well known, is that you should in fact switch. The reason is that when you made your original choice, you had a 1/3 chance of getting the car. That much of course is obvious. What is not obvious is that when the host swings open his chosen door (always to reveal a goat) he is providing you with  new information about the situation: he is removing one bad option. This new information can be incorporated into your choice which means you should make that choice again: by switching doors. By switching, you have a 2/3 chance. One way to think about it is that the game only really begins once the host opens his door: that&#39;s the point at which you have all the information.</p><p>  答案现在相当闻名，是你应该交换。原因是，当您制作原创选择时，您有1/3的机会获得汽车。这当然很明显。什么并不明显的是，当主持人摇摆打开他所选的门（总是露出山羊），他为您提供有关情况的新信息：他正在删除一个不好的选择。此新信息可以合并到您的选择中，这意味着您应该再次选择：通过切换门。通过切换，您有2/3机会。考虑一下的方式是，一旦主持人打开了他的门，游戏就真的开始了：那个＆＃39;＆＃39;你有所有信息的重点。 </p><p>  The logic behind this certainly confounds intuition. It&#39;s hard to tell that you are being given new information when the host opens his door. That alone would confuse but what gives the Monty Hall problem extra psychic power is the finesse element: humans are by nature reluctant to go back on their choices. A common mental bias is in effect, &#34;confirmation bias&#34;: the preference for interpreting new information as supportive to your initial choice. Psychologically it is always quite hard to go back on a personal choice. Especially when the effect of that choice has not yet played out!</p><p>这肯定的逻辑肯定会混淆。它难以告诉你在主持人打开门时获得了新信息。仅那个人会混淆，但是什么给予​​蒙特霍尔问题额外的心灵是精神力量：人类是大自然不愿意回到他们的选择。常见的心理偏见有效，＆＃34;确认偏见＆＃34 ;:将新信息解释为初始选择的支持。心理上，追溯个人选择总是很难。特别是当该选择的效果尚未播放！</p><p>  I think confirmation bias afflicts aficionados most of all. If you believe that, for example, &#34;Bitcoin is the future&#34; when others do not, then cryptocurrency becomes the most likely venue for you to be defrauded - whether your central belief is correct is not.</p><p>  我认为确认偏见折磨了所有人的爱好者。如果你相信，例如，＆＃34;比特币是未来的未来和＃34;当别人没有，那么加密货币成为你被欺骗的最有可能的场地 - 无论你的核心信念是否正确。</p><p>      You get an anonymous letter on January 2 informing you that the market will go up during the month. It proves to be true, but you disregard it owing to the well-known January effect (stocks have gone up historically during January). Then you receive another one on February 1 telling you that the market will go down. Again, it proves to be true. Then you get another letter on March 1 - same story. By July you are intrigued by the prescience of the anonymous person and you are asked to invest in a special offshore fund. You pour all your savings into it. Two months later, your money is gone. You go spill your tears on your neighbor’s shoulder and he tells you that he remembers that he received two such mysterious letters. But the mailings stopped at the second letter. He recalls that the first one was correct in its prediction, the other incorrect.</p><p>      1月2日你得到了一个匿名的信，通知您市场将在本月上升。它证明是真的，但由于1月份的效果（股票在1月份历史上历史上涨）而忽略了它。然后你在2月1日收到另一个，告诉你市场会下降。再次，它证明是真的。然后你在3月1日收到另一封信 - 相同的故事。到7月，您感兴趣的是匿名人的预测，您被要求投资于特殊的离岸基金。你把所有的储蓄倒入其中。两个月后，你的钱已经消失了。你会洒在邻居的肩膀上，他告诉你，他记得他收到了两个这样的神秘字母。但邮件在第二封信中停了下来。他回顾说，第一个在预测中是正确的，另一个不正确。</p><p>  In this scenario the scammer is starting out writing to a huge number of people, half with a prediction for the market to go up and the other half with a prediction for it to go down. At the end of each month, he discards those to whom he made an inaccurate prediction and splits the rest into two groups, sending new (opposite) predictions to each group. Eventually some of those being scammed &#34;convert&#34; (I may as well use the marketing terminology given how closely this resembles an  A/B test) and he&#39;s able to dupe them into making an investment.</p><p>  在这种情况下，诈骗者开始写作到大量的人，一半是一个对市场上涨的一半，另一半的预测是为了让它下降。在每个月结束时，他丢弃了他对其进行了不准确的预测并将其余部分分为两组的人，向每个组发送新的（相反）的预测。最终一些被骗的人和＃34;转换＆＃34; （我也可以使用营销术语，因为这类似于A / B测试）和他能够欺骗他们进行投资。</p><p>  The logical part here is  survivorship bias - the systematic omission of things that have failed, leaving a rosy looking dataset. I think of survivorship bias as the pet bias of high finance. It&#39;s the reason why, judging by magazine ads, all actively managed mutual funds have had a good run over the past few years. Of course, the reason for this is the funds that fared badly do not buy magazine adverts (they probably did - several years ago!) - if they still exist at all.</p><p>  这里的逻辑部分是生存的偏见 - 系统遗漏已经失败的事情，留下了一个玫瑰色的寻找数据集。我认为幸存者偏见是高金融的宠物偏见。 ＆＃39;杂志广告的原因是为什么判断，所有积极管理的共同基金在过去几年中都有良好的运营。当然，这个原因是令人息对不当购买杂志广告的资金（几年前他们可能做到了！） - 如果他们仍然存在。</p><p>  The letter scam has a bit more going for it than just one logical bias. The finesse in the letter scam is the change in perspective: everything has been rotated. You aren&#39;t looking at a selective dataset - you are instead a member of it, with no insight into who else is present or absent. Turning things around to a queer angle is a recurring trick in scams as it defeats all the usual rules of thumb that the public have built up as a mental defence.</p><p>  这封信骗局比它不仅仅是一个逻辑偏见。字母诈骗中的技巧是视角的变化：一切都已旋转。你aren＆＃39; t看一个有选择性数据集 - 你是它的成员，没有洞察谁存在或缺席。转到奇怪角度的东西是骗局的重复技巧，因为它击败了公众建立了精神防御的所有通常的拇指规则。</p><p>    Bernie Madoff ran a Ponzi scheme pretending to be the world&#39;s largest hedge fund: taking deposits, posting fictitious profits and then taking more deposits. He was quite successful in this and the scheme could grow as long as the deposits kept coming. It was only when an unrelated crisis in mortgage-backed securities (another scam) caused too many clients to ask for their money back at the same time that his scheme hit the buffers.</p><p>    Bernie Madoff跑了一个假装的Ponzi计划，假装成为世界各地的最大的对冲基金：存款，发布虚构的利润，然后占用更多的存款。他在这方面非常成功，并且只要存款即将来临，该计划就会成长。只有在抵押贷款支持证券（另一个骗局）的无关危机时才会引起太多客户，同时向缓冲区击中缓冲区的同时要求他们的钱。 </p><p>  How did he manage to trick so many? An embarrassingly large number of sophisticated people and institutions lost large sums. For example HSBC lost a billion dollars in Madoff&#39;s fraud. You would hope that HSBC ( the world&#39;s 6th largest bank by assets) were checking up on things, but apparently not. They weren&#39;t the only ones. One reason they were fooled is that Madoff&#39;s results were plausible and never extreme enough to stretch credulity (on their own -  though his claimed trading strategy did arouse suspicion).</p><p>他是怎么设法欺骗这么多的？令人尴尬的大量精致的人和机构丢失了大笔总和。例如，汇丰损失了Madoff＆＃39;欺诈的十亿美元。您希望汇丰银行（世界＆＃39;第6大银行由资产）正在检查事物，但显然不是。他们不喜欢＆＃39;唯一的。他们被愚弄的一个原因是Madoff＆＃39;结果是合理的，从来没有足够的速度来拉伸信贷（独自一人 - 虽然他所声称的交易策略引起了唤起怀疑）。</p><p>  The collapse of Madoff Investment Securities tends to get lumped in with the 2008 financial crisis because it happened at the same time. But Madoff&#39;s fund probably became fraudulent as early as the late 1970s. That means he ran his Ponzi scheme for nearly 40 years, mostly undetected and certainly untroubled. The finesse part is that Madoff had that tacit support of the American financial regulator, who undertook multiple investigations, each of which gave his fund a clean bill of health. Madoff was successful in befriending the regulator, and somehow prevented it from discovering his massive deceit - probably in part because they ruled out the unreasonable: that it was a massive fraud.</p><p>  麦克福夫投资证券的崩溃往往与2008年的金融危机带来了集结，因为它同时发生了。但是Madoff＆＃39;基金可能是20世纪70年代后期早期的欺诈性。这意味着他在近40年来跑到了庞氏计划，大多是未被发现的，肯定是无力的。这种精致部分是麦迪夫的支持，他对美国金融监管机构进行了多次调查，每个人都会给予他的资金干净的健康状况。 Madoff在与监管机构交付的交友中取得了成功，以某种方式防止它发现了他的大规模欺骗 - 可能部分是因为他们排除了不合理的：这是一种巨大的欺诈。</p><p>  There is even perhaps a second finesse part happening with Madoff: that of widespread social proof. He had a huge number of notable investors. Theranos, the fraudulent blood testing company, also amassed a huge number of establishment supporters:  former cabinet ministers,  generals and  famous medics. Frauds like Madoff and Theranos can benefit from a perverse sort of &#34;herd  vulnerability&#34; in that once enough notables make positive public pronouncements it&#39;s easy to convince the rest.</p><p>  甚至可能与Madoff发生的第二种技巧：广泛的社会证明。他有很多值得注意的投资者。 Theranos是欺诈性血液检测公司，也积累了大量的建立支持者：前内阁部长，将军和着名的医疗机构。像Madoff和Theranos这样的欺诈可以受益于＆＃34;牧群脆弱性＆＃34;在这一一次足够的标签中可以使正面公开发音＆＃39;很容易说服剩下的休息。</p><p>    Jonathan Creek, the 90s TV detective/magician, had a compelling philosophy of magic: that magic is when you have expended more effort to achieve a trick than observers think is reasonable. That you&#39;ve spent hundreds of hours practising with decks of cards, that you&#39;ve built a secret passageway across your stage, that you&#39;ve erected an enormous mirror in a public place, etc.</p><p>    Jonathan Creek，90年代电视侦探/魔术师，有一个令人信服的魔法哲学：那魔术是当你花费更多努力来实现技巧而不是观察者认为是合理的。你＆＃39; ve花了数百小时的练习卡片，你在你的舞台上建造了一个秘密的通道，你在公共场所等了一个巨大的镜子等。</p><p>  The idea is that when people look at an illusion, they really consider only the  reasonable ways by which the trick could have been achieved, mentally ruling out all the unreasonable ways. For a trick to work it needs to confound Occam&#39;s razor: there must be a  complicated explanation.</p><p>  这个想法是，当人们看幻想时，他们只考虑了诀窍可以实现的合理方式，精神上裁决所有不合理的方式。为了工作的诀窍需要困惑偶尔＆＃39; s剃须刀：必须有一个复杂的解释。</p><p>  That goes for scams too. The best finesse layers are those that really seem too complicated to be worthwhile - but somehow are, often due to the large scale of the scam.</p><p>  这也适合诈骗。最好的技巧层是那些真正似乎过于复杂的层 - 但不知何故，通常是由于骗局的大规模。</p><p>    It would be brill if there were a simple set of rules that you could follow to detect scams and frauds. Any time there was doubt, you could retreat deep into your bunker of pure logic, get out your scam detection algorithm and set to work with it.</p><p>    如果有一套简单的规则，可以遵循检测诈骗和欺诈，这将是Brill。任何时候有疑问，你都可以将深入的纯粹逻辑撤退，从而释放你的骗局检测算法并设置与它一起使用。 </p><p>  The reason why there can never be any such algorithm is that logical inference already takes as read that you have correctly perceived reality - you need to already have the facts right in order to run through your algorithm. Most scams are attempts to inhibit your ability to percieve reality, first by tricking you into a logical fallacy and then by doubly hiding that fact with sleight of hand. With a good deceit it&#39;s very hard to know how to wrap your mind around it - it doesn&#39;t look like anything that you&#39;ve seen before.</p><p>为什么永远不会有任何这样的算法的原因是逻辑推断已经需要阅读，因为阅读你已经正确地感知的现实 - 你需要已经有了事实，以便通过算法运行。大多数骗局是试图抑制你的能力，首先通过欺骗你陷入逻辑谬论，然后通过双重躲避这一事实。有一个很好的欺骗它＆＃39;很难知道如何在它周围包裹你的思想 - 它没有看起来像以前见过的任何东西＆＃39;</p><p>  In the Monty Hall problem, it is genuinely difficult to notice that when the host opens his door that suddenly new information has been injected into the problem. Even  Paul Erdős, one of the most prolific problem interpreters (and solvers) of all time, was initially   unable to grasp what was going on. And that&#39;s before the psychological attachment to your initial choice is considered. How can you apply the right mental model if you can&#39;t even perceive what&#39;s going on?</p><p>  在蒙特霍尔问题中，真正难以注意到，当主持人打开他的门时，突然将新信息注入问题。即使是PaulErdīs，也是所有时间最多的问题口译员（和索盘）之一，最初无法掌握正在发生的事情。在考虑到您的初始选择之前，＆＃39;＆＃39;在您的初始选择之前。如果可以＆＃39，你如何申请正确的心理模型。甚至会感知到什么＆＃39;</p><p>  When I worked in a Big American Bank, they were very worried about employees being phished by baddies on the internet. In order to build up sufficient apprehension around incoming emails the bank decided to repeatedly phish its own employees: deliberately sending false emails that would trick you into taking action. Clicking on a link or opening the attachment automatically enrolled you in a particularly miserable piece of mandatory training on information security, as a punishment. The bank&#39;s phishing emails were pretty convincing and I had to repeat the training course a few times before gaining a deep distrust of email hyperlinks.</p><p>  当我在一个大型美国银行工作时，他们非常担心员工被互联网上的坏女。为了建立围绕传入电子邮件的充分忧虑，银行决定多次掌握自己的员工：故意发送将欺骗您采取行动的错误电子邮件。点击链接或打开附件自动注册您的信息安全特别悲惨的强制性培训，作为惩罚。银行和＃39;网络钓鱼电子邮件非常令人信服，我必须在获得对电子邮件超链接的深刻不信任之前重复培训课程。</p><p>  I think they were on the right lines. The best defence against frauds and scams seems to be a kind of &#34;intellectual vaccination&#34; via repeated exposure to benign, non-functional specimens.</p><p>  我认为他们在右边。反对欺诈和诈骗的最佳防御似乎是一种＆＃34;智力疫苗接种疫苗和＃34;通过反复接触良性，非功能性标本。</p><p>    Please do feel free to send me  an email about this article, especially if you disagreed with it.</p><p>    请随时向我发送一封关于这篇文章的电子邮件，特别是如果您不同意它。</p><p>    You can get notified when I write something new  by email alert or  by RSS feed.</p><p>    当我通过电子邮件警报或RSS Feed写新的东西时，您可以收到通知。</p><p>  If you have enjoyed this article and as a result are feeling charitable towards me, please test out my site project,  Quarchive, a FOSS social bookmarking style site, and email me your feedback!</p><p>  如果您享受了本文，因此由于对我感到慈善，请测试我的网站项目，Quarchive，讨论福斯社交书签风格网站，并给我发电子邮件！ </p><p>    If you&#39;re interested in accounting, I recommend the book   Financial Shenanigans, which details many common ruses. It appears to be as boring as sin, a simple enumeration of common frauds concerning financial statements, but the ingenuity of crooked accountants is so compelling. There are just so many different ways to cook the books, from surprising places to recognise revenue, capitalising expenses on a rolling basis, moving things back and forth across accounting periods, etc. My feeling is that many of these probably happen regularly in listed companies and are never detected.</p><p>如果你＆＃39;遗嘱感兴趣的会计，我推荐这本书金融神道人，其中详细说明了许多常见的秩序。它看起来像罪恶一样无聊，很简单的常见欺诈有关财务报表，但弯曲会计师的聪明才智是如此引人注目。从令人惊讶的地方烹饪书籍有很多不同的方式来识别收入，在滚动的基础上，资本化费用，跨会计时期来回移动。我的感觉是许多这些可能在上市公司定期发生从未检测到。</p><p>  I strongly recommend    Fooled by Randomness, which is a really enjoyable run through mental deceits both inflicted and self-inflicted. Edward O. Thorp published his autobiography recently which compiles many of  his  previous  adventures into one volume:   A Man for All Markets. I found it surprising how much of his success relied on not being defrauded at various stages.</p><p>  我强烈建议被随机性所迷惑，这是一个非常愉快的贯穿精神欺骗，既造成危害和自我造成。 Edward O. Thorp最近发表了他的自传，将他以前的许多冒险融入了一个卷：所有市场的人。我发现他令人惊讶的是，他的成功依赖于没有被各个阶段被欺骗。</p><p>  Not all scams take money. Some take your time. A surprising number of employees get duped into accepting part of their pay packet as options in their employers&#39; private (and highly illiquid) stock. How many people would willingly invest their salaries in financial derivatives on the stock of their own employers? Invariably these companies don&#39;t open their accounts to these employees for them to conduct an independent valuation and, even if they did, your typical IT worker is not so hot at pricing equity derivatives. Instead they are convinced to accept grossly inflated valuations which see them accepting uncompetitive salaries or staying far too long in a bad job.</p><p>  并非所有骗局都拿钱。有些人花时间。令人惊讶的员工人数被欺骗地接受他们的薪水包的一部分作为雇主的选项＆＃39;私人（和高度恶性）库存。有多少人愿意在其雇主的股票上对金融衍生品投资薪水？这些公司总是不打开他们的账户，为这些员工开放他们进行独立估值，即使他们所做的，你的典型IT工人也不是如此热门定价股权衍生物。相反，他们确信接受严重膨胀的估值，认为他们接受了缺乏竞争的工资或在糟糕的工作中保持得多。</p><p>  The collapse of big frauds can happen in strange ways. I was impressed that, when the Financial Times outed the fraud at Wirecard that the German financial regulator started ligitation - against   the newspaper! - and banned short selling of Wirecard&#39;s stock.</p><p>  大欺诈的崩溃可能以奇怪的方式发生。我留下了深刻的印象，当金融时报在WIRECARD释放德国金融监管机构开始康格的欺诈行为 - 反对报纸！ - 并禁止卖丝网＆＃39;股票。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://calpaterson.com/fraud.html">https://calpaterson.com/fraud.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/tricks/">#tricks</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/欺骗/">#欺骗</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
