According to camera film and personal diaries later found on the scene by investigators, the team made camp on February 1, pitching a large tent on the snowy slopes of Kholat Saykhl, whose name can be interpreted as “Dead Mountain” in the language of the region’s Indigenous Mansi people.</p><p> 一名患有关节痛的学生转了回去，但其余的由23岁的工科学生Igor Dyatlov带领，继续进行。根据调查人员随后在现场发现的照相机胶卷和个人日记，该团队于2月1日建立了营地，在科拉特·塞克（Kholat Saykhl）的雪坡上搭起了一个大帐篷，该帐篷的名字用该地区的土著曼西人。</p><p>    When a search team arrived at Kholat Saykhl a few weeks later, the expedition tent was found just barely sticking out of the snow, and it appeared cut open from the inside. The next day, the first of the bodies was found near a cedar tree. Over the next few months, as the snow thawed, search teams gradually uncovered more spine-chilling sights: All nine of the team members’ bodies were scattered around the mountain’s slope, some in a baffling state of undress; some of their skulls and chests had been smashed open; others had eyes missing, and one lacked a tongue.</p><p>    几周后，当一个搜寻小组到达Kholat Saykhl时，发现远征帐篷几乎没有被雪覆盖，它的内部似乎被切开了。第二天，在雪松树附近发现了第一具尸体。在接下来的几个月里，随着雪融化，搜索小组逐渐发现了更多令人生畏的景象：所有9名成员的尸体都散布在山坡上，其中有些处于令人困惑的脱衣服状态；他们的一些头骨和胸部被砸碎了；其他人缺少眼睛，一个人没有舌头。</p><p> Each body was a piece in a grim puzzle, but none of the pieces seemed to fit together. A criminal investigation at the time blamed their deaths on an “unknown natural force,” and the Soviet bureaucracy kept the case quiet. The lack of detail about this shocking event, an apparent massacre that transpired in a deeply secretive state, gave rise to dozens of long-lived conspiracy theories, from clandestine military tests to Yeti attacks.</p><p> 每个身体都是一个严峻的难题中的一块，但似乎没有一块可以拼在一起。当时的刑事调查将他们的死亡归咎于“未知的自然力量”，苏联官僚机构对此案保持沉默。关于这一令人震惊的事件的细节的缺乏，一种在深奥的秘密状态下发生的明显屠杀，引起了数十年的长期阴谋论，从秘密军事试验到雪人袭击。</p><p>  In the wake of renewed media interest and pervasive outlandish hypotheses, Russian authorities recently reexamined the case around the Dyatlov Pass incident and  concluded in  2019 that an avalanche was primarily responsible for the nine deaths. Key scientific details were absent from the report, however, including a clear explanation as to how an avalanche could have taken place with no documented evidence of its occurrence left behind. This led to continued doubts around the seemingly pat explanation from a government long infamous for its lack of transparency.</p><p>  在媒体重新关注和普遍的怪异假设之后，俄罗斯当局最近重新审视了Dyatlov Pass事件，并在2019年得出结论，雪崩是造成9人死亡的主要原因。但是，该报告中没有提供关键的科学细节，包括对雪崩如何发生的清晰解释，而没有记录下来的雪崩发生证据。长期以来因臭名昭著的政府缺乏透明度而对这种看似轻描淡写的解释造成了持续的怀疑。 </p><p>  Many argued that the avalanche theory, initially proposed in 1959, still didn’t seem to stack up: The team’s tent encampment was cut into the snow on a slope with an incline seemingly too mild to permit an avalanche. There was no snowfall on the night of February 1 that could have increased the weight of the snow burden on the slope and triggered a collapse. Most of the blunt force trauma-like injuries and some of the soft tissue damage were atypical of those caused by avalanches, whose victims usually  asphyxiate. And if an avalanche had occurred, why was there a gap of at least nine hours, according to forensic data, between the team members cutting the slope for their encampment and the eventual avalanche?</p><p>许多人争辩说，最初于1959年提出的雪崩理论似乎仍然没有得到解决：该团队的帐篷营地被斜坡上的雪地切成雪坡，坡度似乎太小而无法雪崩。 2月1日晚上没有降雪，可能会增加斜坡上雪重的重量并引发倒塌。大多数由钝器造成的类似创伤的创伤和一些软组织损伤都不是由雪崩引起的，它们通常是窒息的。如果发生雪崩，根据法医数据，为什么团队成员之间要切开营地的坡度与最终雪崩之间至少要有9个小时的间隔？</p><p> That curious delay was of particular interest to  Alexander Puzrin, a geotechnical engineer at ETH Zürich, one of Switzerland’s federal institutes of technology. He had recently published a  paper explaining how, strange though it may seem, an earthquake can trigger an avalanche with a gap ranging from mere minutes to several hours between the two events. While Puzrin grew up in Russia, he learned of the Dyatlov Pass story only a decade ago. He was fascinated by the infamous incident and what may have caused it, but was understandably wary of tackling the question solo.</p><p> 瑞士联邦理工学院之一苏黎世联邦理工学院的岩土工程师亚历山大·普兹林（Alexander Puzrin）尤其对这种奇怪的延迟感到兴趣。他最近发表了一篇论文，解释了地震是如何引发雪崩的，尽管看起来似乎很奇怪，但两次事件之间的差距只有几分钟到几小时不等。当Puzrin在俄罗斯长大时，他仅在十年前就了解了Dyatlov Pass的故事。臭名昭著的事件以及可能引起事件的原因使他着迷，但可以理解的是，他对单独解决这个问题持谨慎态度。</p><p> Johan Gaume, head of the Snow Avalanche Simulation Laboratory at EPFL, another Swiss federal technical institute in Lausanne, got to know Puzrin around the time of the 2019 Russian inquiry into what happened at Dyatlov Pass. Suspecting the avalanche delay issue held one of the keys to solving the mystery, they teamed up to create analytical models and computer simulations to try and replicate the obfuscated hours that stole the mountaineers’ lives.</p><p> 洛桑的另一家瑞士联邦技术学院EPFL的雪崩模拟实验室负责人Johan Gaume在2019年俄罗斯对Dyatlov Pass发生的情况进行询问时认识了Puzrin。怀疑雪崩延迟问题是解决这个谜团的关键之一，他们联手创建了分析模型和计算机模拟，以尝试复制那些困扰登山者生命的混乱时间。</p><p> The scientific investigation came with an added benefit from Puzrin’s wife, who is Russian. “When I told her that I was working on the Dyatlov mystery, for the first time she looked at me with real respect,” he says.</p><p> 普祖林的妻子是俄罗斯人，这项科学研究使他受益匪浅。他说：“当我告诉她我正在研究Dyatlov之谜时，她第一次真正地看着我。”</p><p>  The shallow slope argument against an avalanche was tackled early on: It turned out not to be all that shallow after all. The undulating topography on Kholat Saykhl, covered by snowfall, made the slope appear mild, but it was actually closer to 30 degrees, the rule-of-thumb  minimum requirement for many avalanches. Reports dating back to the site’s initial investigation also describe an underlying snow layer on the mountain that didn’t clump together, providing a weak, slippery base that a lot of overlying snow could easily slide over.</p><p>  反对雪崩的浅层论点在早期得到解决：事实证明毕竟不是那么浅。 Kholat Saykhl上起伏的地形被降雪覆盖，使斜坡显得平缓，但实际上接近30度，这是许多雪崩的经验法则最低要求。可以追溯到该站点最初调查的报告还描述了山上的一层积雪并没有聚集在一起，提供了一个薄弱而湿滑的基础，许多上覆的积雪很容易滑过。</p><p>  Then there was the question of the snow mass: The cut the team made in the snow to pitch their tent destabilized the slope, but additional snow had to have collected before any avalanche could happen. While weather reports record no snow that fateful night, the Dyatalov group’s diary entries note there were very strong winds. These were likely to be  katabatic winds—heavy clumps of frigid air that brought large amounts of snow from higher up down toward the campsite, increasing the load on an already precarious slope and explaining the nine-hour delay between the snow cut and the avalanche.</p><p>  然后是雪量的问题：团队在雪地上砍伐帐篷的帐篷使山坡不稳定，但是必须先收集更多的雪才能发生雪崩。尽管天气预报显示，那天晚上没有下雪，但Dyatalov小组的日记记录显示，风很大。这些可能是方差的风-大团的冰冷的空气将大量的雪从高处向下带到营地，增加了原本不稳定的斜坡上的负荷，并解释了降雪和雪崩之间的九小时延迟。</p><p> The researchers’ computer simulations show the avalanche on Kholat Saykhl wouldn’t have been huge, perhaps involving a block of icy matter a mere 16 feet long—about the size of an SUV. The small size explains why no evidence for an avalanche was found during the initial investigation; it would have infilled the cut-out campsite before being quickly buried by fresh snowfall. But how could such a small collapse have caused such traumatic injuries?</p><p> 研究人员的计算机模拟结果表明，霍拉特·塞克（Kholat Saykhl）上的雪崩并不算大，可能涉及的冰块只有16英尺长，大约相当于SUV的大小。小尺寸解释了为什么在最初的调查中没有发现雪崩的证据；在被新的降雪迅速掩埋之前，它会填满开挖的营地。但是，这么小的坍塌怎么会造成如此严重的伤害呢？ </p><p>  To answer that question, the scientists relied on some unorthodox sources of inspiration and information. Gaume explained how, a few years back, he was struck by how well the movement of snow was depicted in the 2013 Disney movie  Frozen—so impressed, in fact, that he decided to ask its animators how they pulled it off. (The Walt Disney Company is majority owner of National Geographic Partners.)</p><p>为了回答这个问题，科学家们依靠了一些非常规的灵感和信息资源。 Gaume解释了几年前的事，他对2013年迪斯尼电影《冰雪奇缘》中雪的运动表现得如此出色感到惊讶，事实上，他印象深刻，以至于他决定询问动画师如何将其拉下。 （迪斯尼公司是国家地理合作伙伴的大股东。）</p><p> Following a trip to Hollywood to meet with the specialist who worked on  Frozen’s snow effects, Gaume modified the film’s snow animation code for his avalanche simulation models, albeit with a decidedly less entertaining purpose: to simulate the impacts that avalanches would have on the human body.</p><p> 在前往好莱坞与《冰雪奇缘》的雪景效果专家见面后，高梅为雪崩模拟模型修改了影片的雪景动画代码，尽管其娱乐目的显然不那么多：模拟雪崩对人体的影响。</p><p>  Code in hand, the pair then needed realistic values for the forces and pressures the human body could experience in an avalanche. This time, their information came from the automotive industry.</p><p>  掌握了密码，这对夫妇就需要对人体在雪崩中可能经历的力和压力的真实值。这次，他们的信息来自汽车行业。</p><p> “We discovered that, in the 70s, General Motors (GM) took 100 cadavers and broke their ribs,” says Puzrin, “hitting them with different weights at different velocities” to see what would happen during a car crash.  The data was ultimately used to calibrate the safety of seat belts.</p><p> “我们发现，在70年代，通用汽车（GM）抓住了100具尸体，摔断了肋骨，”普兹林说，“以不同的速度以不同的重量击中他们”，以查看在车祸中会发生什么。该数据最终用于校准安全带的安全性。</p><p> Some of the cadavers used in the GM tests were braced with rigid supports while others weren’t, a variable which ended up being serendipitous for Puzrin and Gaume. Back on the slopes of Kholat Saykhl, the team members had placed their bedding atop their skis. This meant that the avalanche, which hit them as they slept, struck an unusually rigid target—and that the GM cadaver experiments from the 1970s could be used to calibrate their impact models with remarkable precision.</p><p> 通用汽车测试中使用的一些尸体带有刚性支撑，而其他尸体则没有，这最终导致了Puzrin和Gaume的偶然性。回到Kholat Saykhl的山坡上，团队成员将被褥放在滑雪板上。这意味着在他们睡觉时击中他们的雪崩击中了一个异常坚硬的目标，并且可以使用1970年代的GM尸体实验来以极高的精度校准其冲击模型。</p><p> The researchers’ computer models demonstrated that a 16-foot-long block of hefty snow could, in this unique situation, handily break the ribs and skulls of people sleeping on a rigid bed. These injuries would have been severe, but not fatal—at least not immediately—says Puzrin.</p><p> 研究人员的计算机模型表明，在这种独特情况下，一块16英尺长的大雪块可以轻易地打破在刚性床上睡觉的人的肋骨和头骨。 Puzrin说，这些伤害本来是严重的，但不是致命的-至少不是立即造成的。</p><p> Jordy Hendrikx, the director of the Snow and Avalanche Lab at Montana State University, who was not involved in the current research, has long suspected an avalanche would be the most plausible villain for the Dyatlov Pass incident, but it wasn’t obvious that Kholat Saykhl was avalanche terrain. He says the team’s simulations have now recreated the deadly night with a newfound fidelity.</p><p> 蒙大拿州立大学雪与雪崩实验室主任乔迪·亨德里克斯（Jordy Hendrikx）一直没有参与当前的研究，他一直怀疑雪崩可能是Dyatlov Pass事件中最合理的反派，但Kholat并不清楚Saykhl是雪崩地区。他说，该团队的模拟现在以一种新发现的保真度再现了这个致命的夜晚。 </p><p> “[T]he way they’ve shown that empirically in their equations seems perfectly robust,” Hendrikx says. “It’s exciting how new science developments in the avalanche world can shed new light on these historic puzzles.”</p><p>亨德里克斯说：“他们以经验证明他们的方程式看起来非常稳健。” “令人兴奋的是雪崩世界的新科学发展如何为这些历史难题解开新的亮光。”</p><p> It’s a bit surprising that such a small avalanche could cause such violent injuries, says  Jim McElwaine, a geohazards expert at Durham University in England who was not involved with the study. He suspects that the block of snow would have needed to be incredibly stiff and moving at some speed to accomplish this.</p><p> 英格兰杜伦大学的地质灾害专家吉姆·麦克尔瓦因（Jim McElwaine）表示，如此小的雪崩会造成如此剧烈的伤害，这有点令人惊讶。他怀疑，要实现这一目标，积雪必须坚硬得难以置信并以一定速度移动。</p><p> Freddie Wilkinson, a professional mountain climber and guide not involved with the work, says that it’s entirely reasonable that such innocuous-sounding slabs could cause acute bodily harm. “[S]ome slabs can be quite hard, and it’s very plausible they can result in blunt trauma wounds,” he says.</p><p> 专业的登山者，未参与此项工作的向导弗雷迪·威尔金森（Freddie Wilkinson）说，听起来如此纯真的板可能会造成严重的人身伤害，这是完全合理的。他说：“某些平板可能非常坚硬，并且很可能会导致钝性伤口受伤。”</p><p> “I’m absolutely convinced that the tragedy was the result of wind and snow deposition, and the fact that they pitched camp in the lee of a ridge,” Wilkinson adds. “I’ve made this mistake in my mountaineering career more than once.” During an expedition to  Antarctica in 2012 , tents belonging to Wilkinson’s team were pitched inside a circle of wind-deflecting snow walls they made. Returning to camp after three days, his team found that two tents tucked in the wind-shielded wall were completely buried.</p><p> 威尔金森补充说：“我绝对相信这场悲剧是风雪积雪的结果，也是他们将营地推到山脊的事实。” “我在登山事业中犯了这个错误多次。”在2012年对南极洲的一次考察中，属于威尔金森团队的帐篷被扎在他们制作的挡风雪墙的围圈内。三天后返回营地，他的团队发现，两个塞在挡风玻璃墙上的帐篷被完全掩埋了。</p><p> The avalanche that appears to have occurred on February 1, 1959, on Kholat Saykhl was an incredibly rare type of event. But rare events do occur, and this one could have come to pass only at that exact spot, at that exact moment, during that one very wintery night.</p><p> 似乎在1959年2月1日发生在Kholat Saykhl的雪崩是非常罕见的事件。但是确实发生了罕见的事件，并且这一事件可能只在那个非常寒冷的夜晚的那个确切的时刻，那个确切的时刻才发生。</p><p>  What happened after the avalanche is speculation, but the current thinking is that the team cut themselves out of the smothered tent, fleeing in a panic toward temporary shelter in the treeline a mile or so downslope. Three of them were severely injured, but everyone was found outside of the tent, so it’s likely the more able-bodied survivors dragged the injured out of their smothered shelter in an attempt to rescue them. “This is a story of courage and friendship,” says Puzrin.</p><p>  雪崩后发生的事情是投机活动，但目前的想法是，该团队将自己从闷闷不乐的帐篷中砍下，惊慌失措地逃到了大约一英里处的山坡上临时避难所。其中三人受了重伤，但每个人都在帐篷外被发现，因此，身体更强壮的幸存者很可能将受伤者拖出了闷热的庇护所，试图营救他们。 “这是一个勇气和友谊的故事，”普兹林说。</p><p> Most of the nine who perished on Kholat Saykhl died of hypothermia, while others may have succumbed to their injuries. The state of undress some were found in remains puzzling ( paradoxical undressing may be an explanation), as do reports that note some of the bodies had traces of radioactivity (which may be a result of  thorium present in camping lanterns). The missing eyes and tongue of some victims may have simply been a result of scavenging animals pecking at the dead, but that too remains an open question.</p><p> 在霍拉特·塞克（Kholat Saykhl）上丧生的九个人中，大多数人死于体温过低，而其他人则可能死于伤病。一些遗体令人不解地发现了其脱衣服状态（这可能是一种悖论性的脱衣服），还有报告指出某些尸体具有放射性痕迹（可能是野营灯笼中存在or的结果）。一些受害者缺少的眼睛和舌头可能仅仅是由于清理啄食死者的动物而造成的，但这仍然是一个悬而未决的问题。 </p><p> This new study doesn’t try to explain everything that happened back in 1959, and the Dyatlov Pass case will likely never be fully closed, says Gaume. This study simply offers a reasonable account of the events that ultimately triggered the deaths on Kholat Saykhl.</p><p>Gaume说，这项新研究并未试图解释1959年发生的一切，而Dyatlov Pass案可能永远不会完全结案。这项研究只是合理地说明了最终引发Kholat Saykhl死亡的事件。</p><p> That matters, not least because the enigmatic tragedy remains heartbreaking for the living relatives of the victims. Some in Russia have voiced the opinion that these hikers had taken stupid or unnecessary risks that ultimately killed them. “This kind of tarnishes their legacy,” says Puzrin, whose study shows that this freak avalanche would have surprised mountaineering experts with a lifetime of experience. The Dyatlov team members, Puzrin says, were very competent people who would never have foreseen the danger of clearing a space for their tent on what looked like a gentle slope.</p><p> 这很重要，尤其是因为神秘的悲剧仍然令受害者的在世亲人心碎。俄罗斯的一些人表达了这样的观点，即这些徒步旅行者承担了愚蠢或不必要的风险，最终杀死了他们。普兹林说：“这种破坏了他们的遗产，”他的研究表明，这种奇特的雪崩会让一生具有丰富经验的登山专家感到惊讶。普兹林说，戴亚特洛夫队的成员非常有干劲，他们永远不会预见到在看起来像是平缓的斜坡上的帐篷上腾出空间的危险。</p><p> Gaume nevertheless fears the explanation they presented today is too straightforward for much of the public to accept. “People don’t want it to be an avalanche,” he says. “It’s too normal.” That unyielding skepticism, along with the haunting nature of the Dyatlov Pass incident, will keep conspiracy theories alive well into the future.</p><p> 尽管如此，Gaume担心他们今天提出的解释过于简单，以至于许多公众都无法接受。他说：“人们不希望雪崩。” “太正常了。”这种坚决的怀疑态度以及Dyatlov Pass事件的令人困扰的性质，将使阴谋理论在未来持续存在。</p><p> “To me, this story is uniquely powerful, profound, poignant, because this was a group of young people going off into the wilderness and they never came back,” says Wilkinson.</p><p> 威尔金森说：“对我来说，这个故事具有独特的影响力，深刻而深刻，因为这是一群年轻人走进旷野，他们再也没有回来。”</p><p> “People love to invent implausible scenarios about death in the wilderness, because we will never know 100 percent what happened.”</p><p> “人们喜欢发明荒谬的荒野死亡场景，因为我们永远不会100％知道发生了什么。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2021/01/has-science-solved-history-greatest-adventure-mystery-dyatlov/">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2021/01/has-science-solved-history-greatest-adventure-mystery-dyatlov/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/是否/">#是否</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/solved/">#solved</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/雪崩/">#雪崩</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
