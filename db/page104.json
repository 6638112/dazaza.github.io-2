", "note_en": "TL;DR A small CPU design that can come in handy, a detailed code walkthrough, a good place to start learning about both Silice and RISC-V.\n   The Ice-V is a processor that implements the  RISC-V RV32I specification. It is simple and compact (~100 lines when reduced, see image below), demonstrates many features of Silice and can be a good companion in projects. It is specialized to execute code from BRAM, where the code is baked into the BRAM upon synthesis (can be a boot loader later loading from other sources).\n It is easily hackable and would be extendable to boot from SPI, execute code from a RAM, and connect to various peripherals. The example drives LEDs and an external SPI screen.\n The version here runs out of the box on the IceStick ice40 1HK, and can adapted to other boards with minimal effort.\n      The build is performed in two steps, first compile some code for the processor to run:\n     On an IceStick the LEDs will blink around the center one in a rotating pattern.\n     Optionally you can plug a small OLED screen (I used  this one, 128x128 RGB with SSD1351 driver).\n       Note: Compling code for the processor requires a RISC-V toolchain. Under Windows, this is included in the binary package from my  fpga-binutils repo. Under macOS and Linux there are precompiled packages, or you may prefer to compile from source. See see  gettingstarted for more detailed instructions.\n   Now that we have tested the Ice-V let&#39;s dive into the code! The  entire processor fits in less than 300 lines of Silice code (~130 without comments).\n A Risc-V processor is surprisingly simple! This is also a good opportunity to discover some Silice syntax and features.\n The processor is in file  ice-v.ice. For the demos, it is included ina minimalist SOC in file  ice-v-soc.ice.\n  algorithm execute is responsible for splitting a 32 bit instruction just read from memory into information used by the rest of the processor (decoder), as well as performing all integer arithmetic (ALU): add, sub, shifts, bitwise operators, etc.\n algorithm rv32i_cpu is the main processor loop. It fetches instructions from memory, reads registers, setups the decoder and ALU with this data, performs additional memory load/stores as required, and stores results in registers.\n   We will skip everything at the beginning (we&#39;ll come back to that when needed)and focus on the infinite loop that executes instructions. It has the following structure:\n while ( 1) {   // 1. - an instruction just became available   // - setup register read++:   // wait for registers to be read (1 cycle)   // 2. - register data is available   // - trigger ALU  while ( 1) {   // decode + ALU while entering the loop (1 cycle)   // results from decoder and ALU available  if (exec. load | exec. store) {   // 4. - setup load/store RAM address   // - enable memory store?++:   // wait for memory transaction (1 cycle)   // 5. - write loaded data to register?   // - restore next instruction address  break;   // done   // next instruction read while looping back (1 cycle) }  else {   // 6. - store result of instruction in register   // - setup next instruction address  if (exec. working ==  0) {   // ALU done?  break;   // done   // next instruction read while looping back (1 cycle) } } }}\n The loop structure is constructed such that most instructions take three cycles, with load/store requiring an additional cycle. It also allows to wait for the ALU which sometimes needs multiple cycles (shifts proceed one bit per cycle).Silice  has precise rules on how cycles are used in control flow (while/break/if/else), which allows us to write the loop so that no cycles are wasted.\n  Let&#39;s go through this step by step. The first  while (1) is the main processor loop. At the start of the iteration (marker  1. above) an instruction is available from memory, either from the boot address at startup, or from the previous iteration setup.We first copy the data read from memory into a local  instr variable, so that weare free to do other memory transactions. We also copy the memory address from whichthe instruction came in a variable called  pc for  program counter.\n   Storing the instruction in  instr will also update the values read from the registers.That is done in the  always_after block, which specifies things to be done  every cycleand  after everything else. The  always_after block contains these two linessetting up register read from  instr:\n // vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv ignore for nowxregsA.addr =   /* xregsA.wenable ? exec.write_rd :  */ Rtype(instr).rs1;xregsB.addr =   /* xregsA.wenable ? exec.write_rd :  */ Rtype(instr).rs2;\n The registers are stored in two BRAMs,  xregsA and  xregsB. By setting their addr field we known that the values of the registers will be in their  rdatafield  at the next clock cycle. That is the reason we wait for one cycle witha  ++: after marker  1.\n  // bitfield for easier decoding of instructionsbitfield Rtype { uint1 unused1, uint1 sign, uint5 unused2, uint5 rs2, uint5 rs1, uint3 op, uint5 rd, uint7 opcode}\n Writing  Rtype(instr).rs1 is the same as  instr[15,5] (5 bits width from bit 15), but in aneasier to read/modify format.\n The reason we use two BRAMs is to be able to read two registers in a single cycle.So these two BRAMs always contain the same values, but can be read independently.\n    xregsA and  xregsB are always written to together, so they hold the same values.This is also done in the  always_after block:\n // write back data to both register BRAMsxregsA.wdata = write_back; xregsB.wdata = write_back;   // xregsB written when xregsA isxregsB.wenable = xregsA.wenable;   // write to write_rd, else track instruction registerxregsA.addr = xregsA.wenable ? exec.write_rd : Rtype(instr).rs1;xregsB.addr = xregsA.wenable ? exec.write_rd : Rtype(instr).rs2;\n Both BRAM  wdata field are set to the same  write_back value and  xregsB.wenable tracks xregsA.wenable. Finally, when their field  wenabled = 1 they both write to thesame  addr given by  exec.write_rd. This ensures both BRAMs always containthe same values.\n  After this setup, we wait for one cycle ( ++:) for the register values to be available at the BRAM outputs. Once the register values are available (marker  2.), the decoder and ALU will start refreshing from these updated values. Both decoder and ALU are grouped in the secondalgorithm called  execute. The outputs of  execute are accessed with the &#39;dot&#39;syntax:  exec.name_of_output.\n  // decoder + ALU, executes the instruction and tells processor what to doexecute  exec( instr &lt;:: instr, pc &lt;:: pc, xa &lt;: xregsA.rdata, xb &lt;: xregsB.rdata);\n The algorithm receives the instruction  instr, the program counter  pc, theregister values  xregsA.rdata and  xregsB.rdata. These are  bound to thealgorithm&#39;s inputs with the wiring operators  &lt;:: and  &lt;: . There is an importantdistinction between both related to timing. Operator  &lt;:: means that the variable is wired suchthat the instantiated algorithm  execute sees its value  before it is changedby the host algorithm  rv32i_cpu during the cycle. Therefore  execute does notimmediately see the change when both  instr and  pc are assigned at marker  1.,but onlys see the change at the next cycle (after the  ++:). This creates a onecycle latency, but also makes the circuit shorter leading to an increased maxfrequency for the design. These are important tradeoffs to play with in your designs.\n Back to marker  2., as soon as the register data is available information flowsthrough  execute and we have nothing specific to do. However, the ALU part of  executeneeds to be told it should trigger its computations at this specific cycle:\n  For all details on the (important!) topic of algorithm bindings and timings  please refer to the dedicated page.\n  Then we enter a second  while(1) loop. In many cases we will break out of this second loop after just one cycle, but sometimes the ALU needs to work over multiple cycles, so the loop allows to wait. Entering a loop takes one cycle, so while we enter the loop data flows through  execute and its outputs are ready when we are in the loop.\n In the loop we distinguish two cases: either a load/store has to be performed  if (exec.load | exec.store) or else another instruction is running. Let&#39;s first consider the second case (marker  6.). A non load/store instruction ran through the decoder and ALU.\n  First, we consider writing the instruction result to a register. This is done with the following code:\n  Recall  xregsA is a BRAM holding register values. Its  wenable field indicates whether we write (1) or read (0). Here, it will be enabled if the decoder output  exec.no_rd is low. But that seems a bit short? For instance where do we tell  what to write?This is in fact done in the  always_after block, as we have seen earlier (see  Registers section above). The data to be written is set with:\n  This explains why we don&#39;t need to set it again when writing the result of the instruction to the register.\n But why do that? Why not simply write this code in  6. alongside the rest? This is for efficiency, both in terms of circuit size and frequency. If the assignment was in  6. a more complex circuit would be generated to ensure it is only done in this specific state. This would require a more complex multiplexer circuit, and therefore it is best to always blindly set this value in the  always_after block. As long as we do not set  xregsA.wenable = 1 nothing gets written anyway. This is a very important aspect of efficient hardware design, and by carefully avoiding uncessary conditions your designs will be made much more efficient. Please also refer to  Silice design guidelines.\n  // what do we write in register? (pc, alu or val, load is handled separately)  // &#39;or trick&#39; from femtorv32int32 write_back &lt;: (exec.jump ? (next_pc&lt;&lt; 2) : 32b0) | (exec.storeAddr ? exec.n[ 0,$addrW+ 2$] : 32b0) | (exec.storeVal ? exec.val : 32b0) | (exec.load ? loaded : 32b0) | (exec.intop ? exec.r : 32b0);\n write_back &lt;: ... defines an expression tracker: the read-only variable  write_backis an alias to the expression given in its definition (a  wire in Verilog terms). write_back gives the value to write back based on the decoder outputs. exec.storeAddr indicates to write back the address computed by the ALU in  exec.n (AUIPC). exec.storeVal indicates to write back the value  exec.val from the decoder (LUI or RDCYCLE). exec.jump indicates to write back  next_pc&lt;&lt;2 (JAL, JALR, conditional branches taken). The shift transform 32-bits instruction pointer into byte addresses.\n Alright! the register is updated. Back to marker  6. Next we set the address of the next instruction to fetch and execute:\n  This is either the address computed from the ALU in case of a jump/branchas indicated by  exec.jump, or the value of  next_pc which is simply  pc + 1:the instruction following the current one.\n Almost done, but first we have to check whether the ALU is not in a multi-cycleoperations.This is why we only break  if (exec.working == 0).If not, the loop iterates again, waiting for the ALU.Note that  6. will be visited again, so we&#39;ll write again to the register. And yes, if theALU is not yet done the write we did before might be an incorrect value. But that isall fine: the result will be correct at the last iteration, and it costs us nothingto do these writes. In fact  it costs us less because not doing them would againrequire more multiplexer circuitry!\n After we break, it takes one cycle to go back to the start of the loop. During thiscycle the next instruction is read from  mem and the result (if any) is written tothe register in  xregsA.\n You may have noticed that we wrote the next address in  wide_addr while thememory interface is  mem, so we should have written to  mem.addr? This is to allowthe SOC to see a wider address bus and perform memory mapping. The address we setin  wide_addr is assigned to  mem.addr in the  always_after block, that isapplied at the end of every cycle:  mem.addr = wide_addr. It is also outputfrom the algorithm to the SOC:  output! uint12 wide_addr(0) where  output! meansthe SOC immediately see changes to  wide_addr.\n  That&#39;s it for non load/store instructions. Now let us go back to  if (exec.load | exec.store)and see how a load/store is handled. Because the Ice-V is specialized for BRAM, weknow all memory transactions take a single cycle. While we&#39;ll have to accountfor this cycle, this is a big luxury compared to having to wait for an unknownnumber of cycles an external memory controller.\n When reaching marker  .4 we first setup the address of the load/store. This addresscomes from the ALU:\n  The sift by two is due to the fact that computed addresses are in bytes, whilethe memory interface addresses are in 32-bits words.\n Then, this is either a store or a load. If that is a store, we need to enablewriting to memory. The memory is called  mem and is a BRAM, given to the CPU:  algorithm rv32i_cpu( bram_port mem, ... ). The BRAM holds 32 bits words at each address.To enable writing we set its  wenable member. However this BRAM has a specificity:it allows a write mask. So  wenable is not a single bit, but four bits, whichallows to selectively write any of the four bytes at each memory address.\n And we need that! The RISC-V RV32I specification features load/store for bytes,16-bits and 32-bits words. That means that depending on the instruction (SB/SH/SW)we need to setup the write mask appropriately. This is done with this code:\n // == Store (enabled below if exec.store == 1)  // build write mask depending on SB, SH, SWmem.wenable = ({ 4{exec. store}} &amp; { {  2{exec. op[ 0, 2]==2b10} }, exec. op[ 0, 1] | exec. op[ 1, 1], 1b1 } ) &lt;&lt; exec.n[ 0, 2];\n That might seem a bit cryptic but what this does is to produces a write mask of the form  4b0001, 4b0010, 4b0100, 4b1000 (SB) or  4b0011, 4b1100 (SH) or  4b1111 (SW) depending on  exec.op[0,2] (load type) and  exec.n[0,2] (address lowest bits).As this may not be a store after all, an AND between the mask and  exec.store isapplied. The syntax  {4{exec.store}} means that the bit  exec.store is replicatedfour times to obtain a  uint4.\n Next we wait one cycle for the memory transaction to occur in BRAM with  ++:. Ifthat was a store we just wrote and we are done when we reach marker  5.\n If that was a load we just read from memory and now have to store the resultin the selected register. This is done by this code:\n  This is enough to trigger the register update, since  xregsA.wdata and xregsA.addr are properly set up afterwards in the  always_after block where wdata is assigned  write_back.Recall that  write_back selects  loaded when  exec.load is high (seedefinition of  write_back above).  loaded is defined as follows:\n // decodes values loaded from memory (used when exec.load == 1)uint32 aligned &lt;: mem.rdata &gt;&gt; {exec. n[ 0, 2],3b000}; switch ( exec.op[ 0, 2] ) {   // LB / LBU, LH / LHU, LW  case 2b00:{ loaded = {{ 24{(~exec. op[ 2, 1])&amp;aligned[  7, 1]}},aligned[  0, 8]}; }  case 2b01:{ loaded = {{ 16{(~exec. op[ 2, 1])&amp;aligned[ 15, 1]}},aligned[  0, 16]};}  case 2b10:{ loaded = aligned; }  default: { loaded = { 32{1bx}}; }   // don&#39;t care (does not occur)}\n This selects the loaded value depending of whether a byte (LB/LBU), 16-bits (LH/LHU) or 32-bits (LW) were accessed (U indicates unsigned).  mem.rdata is the value right out of memory, andit is shifted in  aligned to be the part selected by the address lowest bits  exec.n[0,2].\n Note that  {exec.n[0,2],3b000} is simply  exec.n[0,2] &lt;&lt; 3 (a left shift by three bits is equivalent to concatenating three 0 bits to the right).\n After the load/store is completed we restore the next instruction address  next_pc,so that the processor is ready to proceed with the next iteration after the break:\n  And that&#39;s it! We have seen the entire processor logic. Let&#39;s now dive into someof the other components.\n  The decoder is part of  algorithm execute. It is a relatively straightforward affair.It starts by decoding allthe possible  immediate values -- these are constants encoded in the differenttypes of instructions:\n // decode immediatesint32 imm_u &lt;: {instr[ 12, 20],12b0};int32 imm_j &lt;: {{ 12{instr[ 31, 1]}},instr[ 12, 8],instr[ 20, 1],instr[ 21, 10],1b0};int32 imm_i &lt;: {{ 20{instr[ 31, 1]}},instr[ 20, 12]};int32 imm_b &lt;: {{ 20{instr[ 31, 1]}},instr[ 7, 1],instr[ 25, 6],instr[ 8, 4],1b0};int32 imm_s &lt;: {{ 20{instr[ 31, 1]}},instr[ 25, 7],instr[ 7, 5]};\n These values are only used when the matching instruction executes. For instance imm_i is used in register-immediate integer operations.\n  uint5 opcode &lt;: instr[  2,  5];uint1 AUIPC &lt;: opcode == 5b00101; uint1 LUI &lt;: opcode == 5b01101;uint1 JAL &lt;: opcode == 5b11011; uint1 JALR &lt;: opcode == 5b11001;uint1 IntImm &lt;: opcode == 5b00100; uint1 IntReg &lt;: opcode == 5b01100;uint1 Cycles &lt;: opcode == 5b11100; uint1 branch &lt;: opcode == 5b11000;\n These are of course mutually-exclusive, so only one of these is  1 at a givencycle.\n Finally we set the decoder outputs, telling the processor what to do with the instruction.\n // ==== set decoder outputs depending on incoming instructions  // load/store?load := opcode == 5b00000; store := opcode == 5b01000;   // operator for load/store // register to write to?op := Rtype(instr).op; write_rd := Rtype(instr).rd;   // do we have to write a result to a register?no_rd := branch | store | (Rtype(instr).rd == 5b0);  // integer operations // store next address?intop := (IntImm | IntReg); storeAddr := AUIPC;   // value to store directly // store value?val := LUI ? imm_u : cycle; storeVal := LUI | Cycles;\n The  always assign operator  := used on outputs means thatthe output is set to this value first thing every cycle (this is a shortcutequivalent to a normal assignment  = in an  always_before block).\n For instance  write_rd := Rtype(instr).rd is the index of the destinationregister for the instruction, while  no_rd := branch | store | (Rtype(instr).rd == 5b0)indicates whether the write to the register is enabled or not.\n Note the condition  Rtype(instr).rd == 5b0 in  no_rd. That is becauseregister zero, as per the RISC-V spec, should always remain zero.\n  The ALU performs all integer computations. It consists of three parts. Theinteger operations such as ADD, SUB, SLLI, SRLI, AND, XOR (output  r) ;the comparator for conditional branches (output  jump) ; the next address adder (output  n).\n Due to the way the data flow is setup we can use a nice trick. The ALU as wellas the comparator select two integers for their operations. The setup of the Ice-Vis such that both can input the same integers, so they can share the same circuitsto perform similar operations. And what is common to  &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=? Theycan all be done with a single subtraction! This trick is implemented as follows:\n // ==== allows to do subtraction and all comparisons with a single adder  // trick from femtorv32/swapforth/J1int33 a_minus_b &lt;: {1b1,~b} + {1b0,xa} + 33b1;uint1 a_lt_b &lt;: (xa[ 31, 1] ^ b[ 31, 1]) ? xa[ 31, 1] : a_minus_b[ 32, 1];uint1 a_lt_b_u &lt;: a_minus_b[ 32, 1];uint1 a_eq_b &lt;: a_minus_b[ 0, 32] ==  0;\n xa is the first register, while  b is selected before based on results from the decoder:\n     // ==== select next address adder first inputint32 addr_a &lt;: pcOrReg ? __signed({pc[ 0,$addrW- 2$],2b0}) : xa;\n For instance, instructions  AUIPC, JAL and  branch will select the programcounter  pc for  addr_a as can be seen in the decoder:\n  The second value in the next address computation is an immediate selected basedon the running instruction:\n // ==== select immediate for the next address computationint32 addr_imm &lt;: (AUIPC ? imm_u : 32b0) | (JAL ? imm_j : 32b0) | (branch ? imm_b : 32b0) | ((JALR|load) ? imm_i : 32b0) | (store ? imm_s : 32b0);\n The next address is then simply the sum of  addr\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-21 09:43:46", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News",

the billionaire real estate mogul and former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, is pouring $100 million into an attempt to rebuild the\u00a0foundations of social media. The effort, which he has loftily named Project Liberty, centers on the construction of a publicly accessible database of people\u2019s social connections, allowing users to move records of their relationships between social media services instead of being locked into a few dominant apps.\n    The undercurrent to Project Liberty is a fear of the power that a few huge companies \u2014 and specifically\u00a0Facebook Inc.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0have amassed over the last decade. \u201cI never thought I would be questioning the security of our underlying systems, namely democracy and capitalism,\u201d McCourt said. \u201cWe live under constant surveillance, and what\u2019s happening with this massive accumulation of wealth and power in the hands of a few, that\u2019s incredibly destabilizing. It threatens capitalism because capitalism needs to have some form of fairness in it in order to survive.\u201d\n McCourt is hardly the only one to feel this way. Others are trying to reform social media by passing new laws or regulations, waiting for the next generation of startups to disrupt the current incumbents, or pressuring Facebook to look inward and revise its business model. McCourt, along with others like Twitter Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey, say the solution may be blockchain, the technology underpinning bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n Project Liberty would use blockchain\u00a0to construct a new internet infrastructure called the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol. With cryptocurrencies, blockchain stores information about the tokens in everyone\u2019s digital wallets; the DSNP would do the same for social connections. Facebook owns the data about the social connections between its users, giving it an enormous advantage over competitors. If all social media companies drew from a common social graph, the theory goes, they\u2019d have to compete by offering better services, and the chance of any single company becoming so dominant would plummet.\n Building DSNP falls to Braxton Woodham, the co-founder of the meal delivery service Sun Basket and former chief technology officer of Fandango, the movie ticket website. Woodham had been toying with the idea of building something like DSNP, but didn\u2019t imagine anyone would be interested in investing in it. When he mulled the idea over with McCourt, he says, \u201cI just thought we were talking about our daydreams, I didn\u2019t think it was something we\u2019d actually do.\u201d\n Instead, McCourt hired Woodham to build the protocol, and pledged to put $75 million into an\u00a0institute at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., and Sciences Po in Paris to research technology that serves the common good. The rest of his $100 million will go toward\u00a0pushing entrepreneurs to build services that utilize the DSNP.\u00a0McCourt calls this his third attempt to fix social media, after previously investing in tech companies he thought would help transform the way people interact online. His previous attempts convinced him that entrepreneurs must\u00a0be supported by academic thinkers exploring the industry\u2019s biggest ethical questions.\n  The blockchain protocol idea echoes a project Dorsey has been pushing at Twitter called Bluesky. Dorsey has been at the center of the fight over how companies like his should police their users. He said after Twitter banned former President Donald Trump that a blockchain-based social graph would reduce the stakes when\u00a0private companies make user decisions.\u00a0\u201cThe reason I have so much passion for Bitcoin is largely because of the model it demonstrates: a foundational internet technology that is not controlled or influenced by any single individual or entity,\u201d Dorsey tweeted on Jan. 13. \u201cThis is what the internet wants to be, and over time, more of it will be.\u201d\n       While the power of social media companies makes many people uneasy, critics also accuse them of not wielding their power effectively, allowing for abusive behavior.\u00a0A decentralized approach to social media could actually undermine the power of content moderation,\u00a0by making it easier for users who are kicked off one platform to simply migrate their audiences to more permissive ones. McCourt and Woodham say blockchain could discourage bad behavior because people would be tied to their posts forever.\n Before Project Liberty grapples with such problems it has to worry about attracting enough people to matter. The current way of doing things is deeply entrenched, and Project Liberty is proposing that the entire internet start doing things\u00a0drastically differently.\u00a0 Eventually, the group plans to\u00a0create its own consumer product on top of the DSNP infrastructure, and wrote in a press release that the eventual result will be an \u201copen, inclusive data economy where individuals own, control and derive greater social and economic value from their personal information.\u201d\n McCourt also believes that recent history has underscored the disfunction of the current system, punctuated by the misinformation-fueled riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan.\u00a06.\u00a0What do social media users really\u00a0have to lose? \u201cLook at the cesspool that\u2019s been created,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at the reality that the internet has become.\u201d\n  Microsoft and partners may be compensated if you purchase something through recommended links in this article.\n                Opens in a new window  Opens an external site  Opens an external site in a new window", "posttime": "2021-06-21 09:01:30", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u533a\u5757\u94fe,\u793e\u4ea4,mogul", "title": "\u623f\u5730\u4ea7Mogul\u5c06\u4f7f\u75281\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u6765\u4f7f\u7528\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6765\u4fee\u590d\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53 ", "title_en": "A Real Estate Mogul Will Spend $100 Million to Fix Social Media Using Blockchain", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/a-real-estate-mogul-has-a-dollar100-million-plan-to-save-the-internet/ar-AALfdW1", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u533a\u5757\u94fe", "\u793e\u4ea4", "mogul"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f9e875478a46c0c63032e3ad14e54496.png", "infoid": 1067112, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\n\u5728\u8fd1\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u56fa\u4f53\u8102\u59dc\u9ec4\u7d20\u9897\u7c92\uff08SLCP\uff09\u5236\u5242\u5728\u6025\u6027\u548c\u4e9a\u6162\u6027\u65bd\u7528\u540e\u5728\u5927\u9f20\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u826f\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff08Dadhaniya\u7b49\uff0c\uff09\u3002 \u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u9f20\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c0f\u9f20\u4e2d\u7684\u5236\u5242\u7684\u53e3\u670dLD 50\u5927\u4e8e2000mg\u00b7kg -1\u4f53\u91cd\u3002 \u5728\u4e9a\u6162\u6027\u6bd2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53e3\u670d\u9972\u517b\u5230W\uff0c\u5c06180,360\u548c720mg\u00b7Kg -1\u4f53\u91cd\u7b2c1\u5929-1\u8fdb\u884cSLCP\u5236\u5242\u7ed9\u4e88  ...... ", "note_en": "TNFs are major mediators of inflammation and inflammation-related diseases, hence, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of blockers of the cytokine, TNF-\u03b1, for the treatment of osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and ankylosis. These drugs include the chimeric TNF antibody (infliximab), humanized TNF-\u03b1 antibody (Humira) and soluble TNF receptor-II (Enbrel) and are associated with a total cumulative market value of more than $20 billion a year. As well as being expensive ($15 000\u201320 000 per person per year), these drugs have to be injected and have enough adverse effects to be given a black label warning by the FDA. In the current report, we describe an alternative, curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a component of turmeric ( Curcuma longa) that is very inexpensive, orally bioavailable and highly safe in humans, yet can block TNF-\u03b1 action and production in  in vitro models, in animal models and in humans. In addition, we provide evidence for curcumin&#39;s activities against all of the diseases for which TNF blockers are currently being used. Mechanisms by which curcumin inhibits the production and the cell signalling pathways activated by this cytokine are also discussed. With health-care costs and safety being major issues today, this golden spice may help provide the solution.\n This article is part of a themed section on Emerging Therapeutic Aspects in Oncology. To view the other articles in this section visit  http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bph.2013.169.issue-8\n Extensive research during the past century has revealed that inflammation plays a major role in most chronic diseases. It was Cornelius Celsus, a physician in first century Rome, who first attempted to describe inflammation as heat (calor), pain (dolor), redness (rubor) and swelling (tumour). Rudolf Virchow, a German scientist from Wurzburg, in 1850, was the first to observe a link between inflammation and various chronic diseases, which include cancer, atherosclerosis, arthritis, diabetes, asthma, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer&#39;s disease (Heidland  et al.,  ). More than 200 different types of inflammatory disease have been described. When the name of a disease ends with \u2018itis\u2019, this means inflammation of the affected organ. Thus, arthritis is inflammation of the joints, whereas bronchitis, sinusitis, gastritis, oesophagitis, pancreatitis, meningitis, rhinitis and gingivitis are, respectively, inflammation of the bronchi, sinuses, stomach, oesophagus, pancreas, brain, nose and gums. Acute inflammation is thought to be therapeutic as it helps an organism to heal. Chronic inflammation, however, can lead to a disease; inflammation of the colon (colitis), for example, when persistant, for as long as 30 years, can finally lead to colon cancer.\n During the past three decades, molecular mechanisms that lead to inflammation have been extensively examined. Various enzymes, cytokines, chemokines and polypeptide hormones have been identified, which can mediate inflammation. These include COX-2, 5-lipooxygenase (LOX), TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, Il-17, IL-21, IL-23 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). Among these, TNF-\u03b1 is a major mediator of inflammation, which is the primary focus of this review.\n TNF has at various times been called  tumour necrosis serum,  cachectin,  lymphotoxin or  monocyte cytotoxin based on work from our laboratory and others. It is now clear that TNF is a 25 kDa transmembrane protein (17 kDa when secreted) produced primarily by activated macrophages. The ability of tumours to undergo haemorrhagic necrosis after injection of endotoxin was first shown by Shear and Perrault ( 1944). O&#39;Malley  et al. ( ) reported that endotoxin injection into normal mice resulted in the appearance of tumour necrotizing activity in the circulating blood. This activity was renamed  tumour necrosis factor by Carswell  et al. ( ). The true chemical identity of TNF, however, was unclear until our group isolated two different molecules: one from macrophages, which we named TNF-\u03b1 (Aggarwal  et al.,  ), and the other from lymphocytes, which we named TNF-\u03b2 (Aggarwal  et al.,  ). The current review primarily deals with TNF-\u03b1.\n Because of the amino acid sequence homology between human TNF-\u03b1 and endotoxin-induced murine cachectin, a protein linked to endotoxin-mediated cachexia and shock (Beutler  et al.,  ), it became clear that TNF-\u03b1 and cachectin were identical. Soon thereafter, numerous groups independently identified the same molecule by using a variety of approaches (Haranaka  et al.,  ; Old,  ; Wang  et al.,  ; Fiers  et al.,  ; Wallach,  ). TNF-\u03b1 is now known to bind to two different receptors, TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B, and to activate caspase-mediated apoptosis, NF-\u03baB, activator protein-1 (AP-1), JNK, p38 MAPK and ERK signalling (  Figure 1). Our group demonstrated that both TNF-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b2 bind to identical receptors and with similar affinities (Aggarwal  et al.,  ). Although much is known about TNF-\u03b1, very little is understood about TNF-\u03b2 (Aggarwal,  ; Aggarwal  et al.,  ). Both overlapping and non-overlapping activities of the two molecules have been reviewed (Stone-Wolff  et al.,  ; Kuprash  et al.,  ; Liepinsh  et al.,  ).\n  Aside from originating in monocytes, it is now clear that TNF-\u03b1 is also produced by a variety of other cell types including Kupffer cells in the liver, astrocytes in the brain, T-cells and beta cells in the immune system, and ovarian cells. In general, under appropriate conditions, most cell types have the potential to produce TNF-\u03b1.\n It is only within the past few decades that the mechanisms by which inflammation is mediated at the molecular level have become apparent. Although the role of macrophages in inflammation has been known for quite some time, the first indication of the pro-inflammatory activity of TNF emerged in 1985 when it was found to stimulate collagenase and PGE 2 production by isolated human synovial cells and dermal fibroblasts (Dayer  et al.,  ; Caput  et al.,  ), thus suggesting that TNF may play a role in the tissue destruction and remodelling associated with inflammatory diseases.\n TNF dysregulation has been linked to a wide variety of diseases including cancer, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, psychological diseases, skin diseases and autoimmune diseases (Aggarwal,  ; Aggarwal  et al.,  ). Thus, blockers of TNF have been approved for the treatment of various autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn&#39;s disease (CD), psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa and refractory asthma. The inhibition of TNF can be achieved with monoclonal antibodies such as infliximab (Remicade; Janssen Biotech Inc., Horsham, PA, USA), adalimumab (Humira; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL, USA), certolizumab pegol (Cimzia; UCB, Brussels, Belgium) and golimumab (Simponi; Janssen Biotech) or with a circulating receptor fusion protein such as etanercept (Enbrel; Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA). Their potential use in other pro-inflammatory diseases is currently being explored. Some of the important adverse effects most extensively associated with TNF blockers include lymphoma, infections, congestive heart failure, demyelinating disease, a lupus-like syndrome, induction of auto-antibodies, injection site reactions and systemic adverse effects (Scheinfeld,  ).\n Numerous reports have suggested that the production of TNF from macrophages activated by various stimuli can be suppressed by curcumin (  Table 1). Studies have supported findings that LPS is one of the major inducers of TNF-\u03b1 in macrophages and monocytes and that curcumin can down-regulate the expression of TNF-\u03b1 (Chan,  ; Abe  et al.,  ; Jang  et al.,  ; Gao  et al.,  ; Strasser  et al.,  ; Woo  et al.,  ; Liang  et al.,  ;  ; Cheung  et al.,  ; Jain  et al.,  ; Nishida  et al.,  ; Zhao  et al.,  ). Besides being expressed by myeloid cells, TNF is also expressed by microglial cells, adipocytes and other cell types. Curcumin, however, has been shown to down-regulate TNF expression (Jin  et al.,  ; Lee  et al.,  ; Zhang  et al.,  ;  ). In addition to being induced by LPS, TNF is also upregulated by a variety of other stimuli including phorbol ester, palmitate and other inflammatory cytokines, and curcumin has been shown to block the expression of TNF induced by all of these stimuli (Abe  et al.,  ; Lee  et al.,  ; Jain  et al.,  ; Wang  et al.,  ).\n AKT, AKT8 virus oncogene cellular homologue; AP-1, activator protein-1; HO-1, haeme oxygenase-1; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; MCP-1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1; MIP-1\u03b1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1; MMP-9, matrix metallopeptidase-9; NQO1, NADH quinone oxidoreductase 1; TRPC1, transient receptor potential channel 1; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1.\n How curcumin down-regulates TNF expression in different cell types and in response to a variety of stimuli has been examined extensively. TNF suppression primarily occurs at the transcriptional level. The factors known to be involved in TNF transcription include the transcription factor ETS (Kramer  et al.,  ), activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2)/Jun (Leitman  et al.,  ; Newell  et al.,  ; Tsai  et al.,  , ), Sp1 (Kramer  et al.,  ), nuclear factor of activated T-cell transcription factor (NFAT) (McCaffrey  et al.,  ; Tsai  et al.,  , ), NF-\u03baB (Udalova  et al.,  ; Kuprash  et al.,  ), early growth response protein-1 (Kramer  et al.,  ), cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) (Geist  et al.,  ), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein \u03b2 (C/EBP\u03b2) (Pope  et al.,  ; Wedel  et al.,  ; Zagariya  et al.,  ), NF-E2-related factor 1 (Novotny  et al.,  ; Prieschl  et al.,  ) and LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 factor (LITAF) (Takashiba  et al.,  ; Myokai  et al.,  ) (  Figure 1). Hence, different transcription factors appear to be involved in the stimulation of TNF expression by various stimuli and in different cell types. For instance, the transcription factor LITAF is involved in LPS-stimulated TNF expression. Whereas ATF2/Jun and NFATp are involved in TNF expression in activated beta and T-cells, C/EBP\u03b2 is involved in human monocytes. Several of these transcription factors have been shown to be modulated by curcumin.\n Curcumin can mediate its effect on TNF expression by inhibiting p300/CREB-specific acetyl transferase, leading to repression of the acetylation of histone/non-histone proteins and histone acetyl transferase-dependent chromatin transcription (Balasubramanyam  et al.,  ). It is also well known that curcumin can down-modulate the activation of NF-\u03baB by a variety of agents (Singh and Aggarwal,  ) and this down-regulation of NF-\u03baB by curcumin plays a major role in suppressing the expression of TNF. In addition, in a number of studies it has been shown that methylation of a TNF promoter may affect the promoter&#39;s function (Kochanek  et al.,  ;  ; Muiznieks and Doerfler,  ; Takei  et al.,  ). Thus, curcumin could affect TNF expression by affecting the methylation of a TNF promoter (Reuter  et al.,  ).\n It is possible that the effects of curcumin on LPS-induced TNF production are mediated in part through its LPS signalling. Two of the toll-like receptors (TLRs), TLR2 and TLR4, mediate responsiveness to LPS. LPS-mediated TLR2 mRNA induction has been shown to be attenuated by pretreatment with curcumin (Matsuguchi  et al.,  ). In addition, there is biochemical evidence indicating that curcumin can inhibit both ligand-induced and ligand-independent dimerization of TLR4 (Youn  et al.,  ). The beneficial effect of curcumin is partly mediated by reducing the expression levels of TNF through inhibition of the expression of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 in mouse liver (Tu  et al.,  ). Curcumin also binds with sub-micromolar affinity to the myeloid differentiation protein-2 (MD-2), which is the LPS-binding component of the endotoxin surface receptor complex MD-2/TLR4 (Gradisar  et al.,  ). The binding site for curcumin overlaps with that of LPS; this results in the inhibition of MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent signalling pathways of LPS signalling through TLR4, indicating that MD-2 is an important target of curcumin involved in its suppression of the innate immune response to bacterial infection.\n There are numerous reports suggesting that curcumin can not only block the production of TNF but also block the cell signalling mediated by TNF in a variety of cell types (  Table 1). Our group was the first to show that curcumin can inhibit TNF-mediated NF-\u03baB action in variety of cell types (Singh and Aggarwal,  ). We also showed that TNF-mediated expression of various cell surface adhesion molecules in endothelial cells is down-regulated by curcumin (Kumar  et al.,  ). Since then, a wide variety of cell signalling pathways activated by TNF have been shown to be down-regulated by curcumin; these include JNK, MAPK, PI3K/Akt.\n In addition, curcumin has also been shown to modulate TNF-\u03b1 function by directly binding to the ligand (Gupta  et al.,  ). Wua  et al. ( 2010) performed molecular docking studies with TNF-\u03b1 and curcumin to predict and analyse the ability of curcumin to inhibit TNF-\u03b1 by binding to it. The protein\u2013ligand interactions were analysed by simulating the docking of the curcumin using Autodock 4.0. They identified three main binding regions for curcumin and found that curcumin is a potent inhibitor of TNF-\u03b1. They also observed that curcumin docked at the receptor-binding sites of TNF-\u03b1. Covalent \u03c0-\u03c0 aromatic interactions or \u03c0\u2013cation interactions were found between curcumin and TNF-\u03b1. The authors predicted that curcumin is a strong inhibitor of TNF-\u03b1 because of the covalent bonds it forms with Cys 129 in TNF-\u03b1. In contrast to its interaction with TNF-\u03b1, it is unclear whether curcumin can interact or affect the expression of TNF-\u03b2 or lymphotoxin.\n The anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin was first demonstrated in acute and chronic models of inflammation in rats and mice (Srimal and Dhawan,  ). The authors showed that curcumin (50\u2013200 mg\u00b7kg \u22121) suppressed carrageenan-induced oedema in mice. Furthermore, curcumin was found to be as potent as phenylbutazone and exhibited minimal ulcerogenic activity. No mortality in mice was noted at doses as high as 2 g\u00b7kg \u22121 bodyweight (Srimal and Dhawan,  ). In the same study, the authors showed that curcumin suppresses formaldehyde-induced arthritis in rats at a dose of 40 mg\u00b7kg \u22121 and inhibited granuloma formation at 80\u2013160 mg\u00b7kg \u22121. However, the mechanism by which curcumin mediates these anti-inflammatory effects in animals was not revealed until several years later, when our group showed that curcumin can suppress TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation (Singh and Aggarwal,  ) and other groups showed that curcumin blocked TNF production in cell culture (Chan,  ) and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (Jobin  et al.,  ). Since then, numerous mechanisms by which curcumin can exhibit anti-inflammatory activity have been proposed (  Figures 1 and   \u200b and2 2).\n  Numerous reports have been published suggesting that oral administration of curcumin down-regulates TNF-\u03b1 expression both in the serum and in the tissue of animals (Nanji  et al.,  ; Yao  et al.,  ; Sharma  et al.,  ; Billerey-Larmonier  et al.,  ; Larmonier  et al.,  ; Ung  et al.,  ; El-Moselhy  et al.,  ; Gutierres  et al.,  ) (  Table 2). Attenuation of TNF-\u03b1 levels by curcumin has been noted in mice (Leyon and Kuttan,  ), rats (Siddiqui  et al.,  ) and rabbits (Yao  et al.,  ; Huang  et al.,  ). A dose of curcumin of 50\u2013500 mg\u00b7kg \u22121\u00b7day \u22121 was used for most of these studies. Endotoxin has been shown to induce septic shock in animals, in part, through the production of TNF, and this condition has been shown to be reversed by curcumin (Siddiqui  et al.,  ; Chen  et al.,  ;  ; Huang  et al.,  ; Nishida  et al.,  ). Decreased TNF-\u03b1 levels have also been noted in tumour-bearing animals treated with this polyphenol (Leyon and Kuttan,  ). In addition to cancer, down-regulation of TNF-\u03b1 by curcumin has been associated with protection from various pro-inflammatory diseases, including sub-chronic inflammation (Nandal  et al.,  ; Nishida  et al.,  ), cardiovascular diseases (Yao  et al.,  ;  ; Mito  et al.,  ; Avci  et al.,  ), diabetes (Jain  et al.,  ; El-Azab  et al.,  ; El-Moselhy  et al.,  ), acute pancreatitis (Gulcubuk  et al.,  ), enterocolitis (Jia  et al.,  ), enteritis (Song  et al.,  ), prostatitis (Zhang  et al.,  ), diabetic neuropathy (Sharma  et al.,  ), hepatic injury (Yun  et al.,  ), Th1-type ileitis (Bereswill  et al.,  ), hepatic fibrosis (Shu  et al.,  ; Zeng  et al.,  ), radiation-induced lung fibrosis (Lee  et al.,  ), asthma (Ammar el  et al.,  ), alcohol-induced liver disease (Nanji  et al.,  ), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (Ramirez-Tortosa  et al.,  ), concanavalin A-induced liver injury (Tu  et al.,  ), renal injury (Hashem  et al.,  ; Pan  et al.,  ), infection (Allam,  ), fatigue (Gupta  et al.,  ), bone turnover (Yang  et al.,  ) and high-fat diet-induced hyperglycaemia (El-Moselhy  et al.,  ). Curcumin has also been found to down-regulate NF-\u03baB-regulated gene products such as inducible NOS (iNOS), IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in animals (Yao  et al.,  ; Yeh  et al.,  ; Jain  et al.,  ). Curcumin also protects against the toxic effects of copper overload (Wan  et al.,  ), dextran sulfate sodium (Arafa  et al.,  ),  p-dioxin (Ciftci  et al.,  ) and aluminum (Sood  et al.,  ) through down-modulation of TNF-\u03b1.\n CCl 4, carbon tetrachloride; DSS, dextran sulfate sodium; GalN,  -galactosamine; HbA1, haemoglobin \u03b11; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A; MCP-1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1; SiO 2, silicon dioxide.\n A reduction in the production of iNOS mRNA was observed when BALB/c mouse peritoneal macrophages cultured  ex vivo were treated with 1\u201320 \u03bcM curcumin (Chan  et al.,  );  in vivo, two oral treatments of 0.5 mL of a 10 \u03bcM solution of curcumin (92 ng\u00b7g \u22121 bodyweight) reduced iNOS mRNA expression in the livers of LPS-injected mice by 50\u201370% (Chan  et al.,  ). This suggests that curcumin is potent at nmol g \u22121 bodyweight. This efficacy was associated with two modifications of the schedule of dosing: firstly, an aqueous solution of curcumin was prepared by initially dissolving the compound in 0.5 N NaOH and then diluting it immediately with PBS; secondly, mice were fed curcumin at dusk after fasting. Inhibition of iNOS mRNA expression was not observed in the mice that were fed  ad libitum, suggesting that food intake may interfere with the absorption of curcumin.\n Curcumin usually manifests its biological response when given orally to mice at about 50\u2013500 mg\u00b7kg \u22121 bodyweight (Farombi and Ekor,  ). These doses, however, are too low to detect significant levels of curcumin in the serum. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear; however, there are several possible explanations. Firstly, curcumin is known to bind to numerous proteins present in the serum including albumin (Gupta  et al.,  ; Kim  et al.,  ). Secondly, curcumin is rapidly transported across the cells and tissues (Anand  et al.,  ). Thirdly, tetrahydrocurcumin, a metabolite of curcumin, was found to be more active than curcumin for treating chloroquine-induced hepatotoxicity in rats (Pari and Amali,  ). Fourthly, in another study it was shown that when curcumin was dissolved in 0.1 N NaOH it manifested its effects in animals in the \u03bcg\u00b7kg \u22121 range (Chan  et al.,  ).\n In one recent study the potential of a novel solid lipid curcumin particle (SLCP) preparation to produce adverse effects in rats after acute and sub-chronic administration was investigated (Dadhaniya  et al.,  ). The oral LD 50 of the preparation in rats as well as in mice was found to be greater than 2000 mg\u00b7kg \u22121 bodyweight. In the sub-chronic toxicity study, 180, 360 and 720 mg\u00b7kg \u22121 bodyweight day \u22121 of SLCP preparation was administered via oral gavage to W\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-21 08:51:59", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u751f\u7269,bioavailable,\u5236\u5242", "title": "\u59dc\u9ec4\u7d20\uff1aTNF\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u4fc3\u708e\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7684\u751f\u7269\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u963b\u6ede\u5242\uff082013\uff09 ", "title_en": "Curcumin: A bioavailable blocker of TNF and other pro-inflammatory biomarkers (2013)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3753829/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u751f\u7269", "\u5236\u5242"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "87fdf88938ee3a206f8f721200f1dc2c.png", "infoid": 1067111, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7528\u4e8e\u9f13\u8d77\u73b0\u4ee3\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u7ec4\u6210\u6587\u5e93\u5bb9\u6613\uff06amp; \u8fc5\u901f\u5730\u3002 \u5468\u56f4\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u53cd\u5e94UI\u5e93\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\u8fd9\u91cc\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u65b0\u4e1c\u897f\u5417\uff1f  \u5b9a\u5236\uff06amp; \u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8fc750\uff05\u7684\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u4ee3\u7801\u662fSCSS\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u8f7b\u677e\u5b9a\u5236\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1 ", "note_en": "A React Component library for buliding modern applications easily &amp; quickly.

It&#39;s had its ups and downs, from the era of net splits to the era of cancel culture. However, we&#39;re proud to announce that we&#39;ve completely obliterated the swamp removing the shackles on progress, and now we&#39;re sailing blue seas. YaRR!\n   The freenode digital autonomous zone is proud to announce IRC.com by freenode. In addition to our FOSS and free IRC bouncer service that keeps you connected 24/7, we now provide Android and iOS applications that connect to our freenode bouncer, enabling push notifications, avatars and a whole other suite of IRCv3 capabilities!\n Head on over to the  Android Play store or the  iOS App store and download, install and login! Share it with your friends as IRC and FOSS are no longer walled gardens - freedom is for everyone with no phone number required!\n For those of you that know what an API is and don&#39;t think it&#39;s a typo for a fruity company, there&#39;s webhooks built in so you can immediately integrate freenode and IRC.com into your development and org processes.\n The app is in  beta, but everything works. If you find any bugs, please let us know in  #freenode-bnc!\n  On the desktop and web, you can use your favorite desktop or web client to connect to the same connection that your iOS and Android apps are on. Simply use the freenode bnc. Use server  bnc.freenode.net with port  6697 and SSL enabled. Then, enter your  username:password in the connection password field and connect.\n We also deployed our  webchat. As of now it connects directly to freenode, but we will soon be adding IRC.com by freenode features which means it will connect to the freenode bnc in the future!\n  Now that IRC is up to speed with modern messaging clients, we&#39;re now aiming to take things further yet. IRC is a much more robust and useable messaging platform than anything else out there. We&#39;re just getting started.\n Special thanks goes out to tjr and his team, as well as the entire  freenode staff as we worked through the transition from legacy to present. An additional special thanks goes out to prawnsalad, who&#39;s previous contributions to the FOSS and IRC community, including the Kiwi IRC suite of FOSS, made all of this possible.\n The power of the people cannot be stopped. freenode is here to stay, no matter what gets thrown at it. It&#39;s now, as well, a recognized digital autonomous zone which gives it the unique ability to provide what freenode does best: freedom.\n freenode is IRC. freenode is FOSS. freenode is freedom.

This is somewhat daunting for me, as speech coding is R&amp;D, which tends to be very open ended; it\u2019s possible to work for months with no clear outcomes. In contrast the modem work is straight forward engineering, and I get the positive feedback of \u201chaving stuff work\u201d on a regular basis.\n So I\u2019m trying to time box the speech coding projects to a few days work each. This is quite a personal challenge, as there are just so many variables and paths to follow. It\u2019s so easy to go off on a tangent and watch the months pass!\n In this particular project I\u2019m looking at the Codec 2 700C Vector Quantiser (VQ), and exploring ways to make it more inherently robust to high pass and low pass filtering at the edges of the spectrum. The broad goal is to improve speech quality at a given bit rate, or support a lower bit rate at the same speech quality. I\u2019m targeting bit rates in the 600 bit/s range, and the lower end of the quality range (communications quality speech).\n  It\u2019s well known that the most important speech information is between 300 and 3000 Hz. Energy outside that range makes the speech sounds nicer, but doesn\u2019t help intelligibility much. Analog modes such as SSB exploit this by band limiting the speech so that the transmitter power is used just to punch through information in the narrow bandwidth that matters.\n With digital speech the RF bandwidth is not directly linked to the bandwidth of the decoded speech. For example FreeDV 700D uses around 1100 Hz of RF bandwidth, but the decoded speech has energy covering most of the 0 to 4000 Hz range.\n Codec 2 encodes and transmits the speech spectrum on a regular basis. As well as encoding parts of the spectrum necessary for intelligibility, it also has to encode other features, such as the high pass and low pass roll off the microphone and analog filters in the sound card. These features don\u2019t carry any intelligibility, but bits are consumed to encode them. When you have just 28 bits/frame \u2013 every bit matters!\n Turns out that some of the wilder variations in the speech spectrum from different sources of speech are in the 0-300Hz and 3000-4000Hz regions, for example different high pass or low pass filtering for a particular microphone or sound card. This can upset the Codec 2 quantiser, e.g. it might expend bits modelling a particular low pass filter response \u2013 lowering the quality of the perceptually important 300-3000 Hz information.\n So I\u2019ve prototyped a Vector Quantiser (VQ) that just uses the information in the 300-3000 Hz range to quantise the speech spectrum. However the VQ is trained on the full range, so it uses that full range to synthesise the speech, hopefully recovering some of the extended spectrum. There is also a limiter before the VQ to reduce the dynamic range of the frames.\n Here are some samples processed with the newamp1 two stage VQ, and the new subset VQ. Like the newamp1 algorithm, it works on vectors of K=20 mel-spaced magnitude samples. The speech codec is only partially quantised (10ms frames, original phase, unquantised pitch), so it would sound worse in a real world fully quantised codec. The \u201cnewamp1\u201d algorithm is used for Codec 2 700C [1] (and employed in FreeDV 700C/D/E), and uses 22 bit/frame (550 bits/s at a 40ms frame rate). The subset VQ uses just 12 bits frame (300 bits/s at a 40ms frame rate).\n  There are some samples where newamp1 sounds louder \u2013 this could be due to the gain limiter stage in the subset algorithm constraining the dynamic range. There also seems to be more high frequency response with newamp1, indicating subset is not recovering the high frequency speech energy as I had hoped. Both are quite intelligible, and acceptable for communications quality speech.\n   Both the samples and objective results show the subset VQ is holding up OK next to the reference newamp1, despite the low bit rate. I\u2019ve found that around 9 dB*dB spectral distortion gives acceptable results for my (low communications quality) use case.\n I tried adding an artificial low pass filter above 3400 Hz to a couple of the input samples, to simulate what might happen from different microphones.\n  It seems to work OK with the low pass filtered input samples, they sound pretty similar to the sample using the original source (one of the goals of this work):\n   I\u2019m surprised that a single stage VQ is working quite well at just 12 bits/frame. It\u2019s also encoding both the average frame energy and the spectral shape (I use a separate scalar quantiser for frame energy in newamp1). This is quite optimal from a VQ theory point of view, but sometimes not possible due to practical concerns such as the storage/CPU requirements for a single stage VQ.\n  Try a few more samples, and push this work through to a fully quantised speech codec.\n Seeing it\u2019s doing well with a single stage, it would interesting to see if it sounds better with multiple stages.\n A single stage VQ enables other tricks, like non-FEC techniques to make the VQ robust to bit errors, such as sorting the VQ indexes [2] or Neural Net style training with bit errors.\n  [1]  Codec 2 700C [2]  Codec 2 at 450 bits/s.

"note_en": "The most accurate distance measurement yet of ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) NGC1052-DF2 (DF2) confirms beyond any shadow of a doubt that it is lacking in dark matter. The newly measured distance of 22.1 +/-1.2 megaparsecs was obtained by an international team of researchers led by Zili Shen and Pieter van Dokkum of Yale University and Shany Danieli, a NASA Hubble Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study.    &#34;Determining an accurate distance to DF2 has been key in supporting our earlier results,&#34; stated Danieli. &#34;The new measurement reported in this study has crucial implications for estimating the physical properties of the galaxy, thus confirming its lack of  .&#34;\n  The results, published in  Astrophysical Journal Letters on June 9, 2021, are based on 40 orbits of NASA&#39;s Hubble Space Telescope, with imaging by the Advanced Camera for Surveys and a &#39;tip of the red giant branch&#39; (TRGB) analysis, the gold standard for such refined measurements. In 2019, the team published results measuring the distance to neighboring UDG NGC1052-DF4 (DF4) based on 12 Hubble orbits and TRGB analysis, which provided compelling evidence of missing dark matter. This preferred method expands on the team&#39;s 2018 studies that relied on &#34;surface brightness fluctuations&#34; to gage distance. Both galaxies were discovered with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array at the New Mexico Skies observatory.\n  &#34;We went out on a limb with our initial Hubble observations of this galaxy in 2018,&#34; van Dokkum said. &#34;I think people were right to question it because it&#39;s such an unusual result. It would be nice if there were a simple explanation, like a wrong distance. But I think it&#39;s more fun and more interesting if it actually is a weird galaxy.&#34;\n  In addition to confirming earlier distance findings, the Hubble results indicated that the galaxies were located slightly farther away than previously thought, strengthening the case that they contain little to no dark matter. If DF2 were closer to Earth, as some astronomers claim, it would be intrinsically fainter and less massive, and the galaxy would need dark matter to account for the observed effects of the total mass.\n   Dark matter is widely considered to be an essential ingredient of galaxies, but this study lends further evidence that its presence may not be inevitable. While dark matter has yet to be directly observed, its gravitational influence is like a glue that holds galaxies together and governs the motion of visible matter. In the case of DF2 and DF4, researchers were able to account for the motion of stars based on stellar mass alone, suggesting a lack or absence of dark matter. Ironically, the detection of galaxies deficient in dark matter will likely help to reveal its puzzling nature and provide new insights into galactic evolution.\n    While DF2 and DF4 are both comparable in size to the Milky Way galaxy, their total masses are only about one percent of the Milky Way&#39;s mass. These ultra-diffuse galaxies were also found to have a large population of especially luminous globular clusters.\n  This research has generated a great deal of scholarly interest, as well as energetic debate among proponents of alternative theories to dark matter, such as modified newtonian dynamics (MOND). However, with the team&#39;s most recent findings\u2014including the relative distances of the two UDGs to NGC1052\u2014such alternative theories seem less likely. Additionally, there is now little uncertainty in the team&#39;s distance measurements given the use of the TRGB method. Based on fundamental physics, this method depends on the observation of red giant stars that emit a flash after burning through their helium supply that always happens at the same brightness.\n  &#34;There&#39;s a saying that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and the new distance measurement strongly supports our previous finding that DF2 is missing dark matter,&#34; stated Shen. &#34;Now it&#39;s time to move beyond the distance debate and focus on how such galaxies came to exist.&#34;\n  Moving forward, researchers will continue to hunt for more of these oddball galaxies, while considering a number of questions such as: How are UDGs formed? What do they tell us about standard cosmological models? How common are these galaxies, and what other unique properties do they have? It will take uncovering many more dark-matter-lacking   to resolve these mysteries and the ultimate question of what dark matter really is.

", "note_en": "Dr. Rhonda Patrick proposes a mechanism for the phospholipid form of DHA to play a role in the prevention of APOE4-associated Alzheimer&#39;s Disease.\n  Dr. Rhonda Patrick recently published a paper on the  Role of Phosphatidylcholine-DHA in preventing APOE4-associated Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n  DHA is an essential omega-3 fatty acid and plays a vital role in the prevention and reversal of cognitive decline and Alzheimer\u2019s Disease\n The form of DHA found in fish, fish roe, and krill oil is primarily in phospholipid form and this form is broken down to DHA-lysoPC\n The form of DHA found in DHA/fish oil supplements is not in phospholipid form and is primarily broken down to free DHA\n APOE4 carriers have impaired free DHA transport into the brain because of APOE4-mediated degradation of the blood brain barrier, but this degradation does not impair how DHA-lysoPC enters the brain\n Dr. Rhonda Patrick proposes that consuming DHA in phospholipid form may be a strategy for APOE4 carriers to get DHA into the brain and prevent APOE4-associated Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, which is found in fish, fish roe, and krill oil but not in fish oil supplements\n  What is Alzheimer\u2019s Disease? Alzheimer&#39;s Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder. Key Characteristics: memory loss, spatial disorientation, cognitive dysfunction, and behavioral changes.\n Alzheimer&#39;s Disease and Age: Risk for AD doubles every 5 years, following the age of 65, and around 1/3 of people over 85 have AD.\n Genetic Risks: Three common isoforms of the APOE(2, 3, 4) gene, each associated with different AD risks. In regard to AD, APOE4 is what we are concerned about. We carry two alleles of one single gene, meaning we can carry either one or two APOE4 alleles. About 1/4 of the population has at least one APOE4 allele. ~65\u201380% of people with AD have at least one APOE4 allele.\n  However, APOE4 does not guarantee you will get AD and not having APOE4 doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t get AD. Interestingly, APOE4 is associated with better cognition and intelligence early in life but earlier decline as we age (an example of antagonistic pleiotropy).\n  The APOE gene codes for the APOE protein. This protein is made in the brain and peripheral tissues but plays similar roles for both in lipid and cholesterol transport.\n In peripheral tissue, APOE is synthesized in the liver and regulates lipid and cholesterol transport to tissues and reverse cholesterol transport (from peripheral tissues back to the liver first via the lymphatic system, then the bloodstream).\n  In the Brain, APOE is synthesized by astrocytes and regulates lipid and cholesterol transport to neurons. APOE2 and APOE3 are expressed 2\u20134 times more in neurons than APOE4, therefore APOE4 has reduced lipid and cholesterol transport to neurons.\n  1. Extracellular Amyloid-\u00df Plaques As we age, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation accumulates in the brain and this is taken care of via the activation of microglial cells (brain\u2019s immune cells). Acutely, microglial cell activation is good, chronic activation is bad. In AD, they are chronically activated by a protein called amyloid-\u00df42, which is a product of full-length amyloid-\u00df cleavage. This triggers a vicious cycle because microglial activation leads to further production of amyloid-\u00df plaques, and thus more amyloid-\u00df42 product. When amyloid-\u00df plaques form these aggregations, they interfere with neuronal communication, disrupting or destroying it.\n  Glymphatic System: activated when we sleep and removes waste products from the brain, including amyloid-\u00df plaques. A lack of sleep = less glymphatic activation = less amyloid-\u00df plaque clearance.\n APOE-mediated Mechanism: APOE binds amyloid-\u00df42 and removes it from the cell. The APOE4 isoform, besides producing less APOE protein, also binds amyloid-\u00df42 with a 20-fold lower affinity than APOE3. This mechanism is therefore very ineffective for APOE4 carriers.\n Sleep matters more for APOE4 carriers since they must rely on only one clearance system (glymphatic  system)\n In short: chronic activation of our brain\u2019s immune cells leads to amyloid-\u00df plaque build up, and clearance is impaired in APOE4 carriers.\n 2. Intracellular Neurofibrillary Tangles: If that looks like gibberish to you, don\u2019t worry that\u2019s what I felt I was typing. These are also referred to as tau tangles, because they are aggregates of tau proteins. These are inside the neurons of patients with AD, whereas the amyloid-\u00df plaques are outside the cell. Tau tangles interfere with how cellular components are transferred inside neurons, and therefore limits energy to the cell needed to form new synapses and maintain those previously formed. Eventually, neurons succumb to this energy deficit resulting in long-term memory loss and neuronal cell death.\n In short: aggregates of tau proteins form tau tangles inside neurons and result in long-term memory loss and neuronal cell death.\n 3. Reduced Brain Glucose Uptake Between our blood and the brain is the blood brain barrier (BBB). Within the BBB are transporters that shuttle glucose into our brain, these are called GLUT transporters (specifically GLUT1 and GLUT3). Neurons rely on GLUT transporters because they cannot store or produce glucose themselves.\n APOE4 carriers typically have downregulation of GLUT transporters, and therefore reduced brain glucose uptake is more prevalent in these individuals.\n A lack of glucose to the brain also contributes to the formation of tau tangles. After a tau protein is translated (produced from its associated mRNA), it is modified in a glucose-dependent manner, and once modified, negatively regulates its phosphorylation. Without this modification, which occurs with reduced brain glucose uptake, tau proteins are hyperphosphorylated (since it has nothing negatively regulating this now), and this renders tau proteins pretty useless in addition to promoting their aggregation and formation of tau tangles.\n In short:  APOE4 carriers have reduced brain glucose uptake (which is more pronounced as we age) because APOE4 downregulates the transport of glucose into the brain.\n  Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is one of the essential omega-3 fatty acids (the other important one is EPA and to a lesser extent, ALA). It accounts for just shy of 1/3 of the brain\u2019s lipids, so it\u2019s presence is pretty critical. Unfortunately, the body cannot produce DHA on its own, and it must be acquired through the diet.\n        Regardless of APOE status, dietary fish and seafood intake slows AD progression and improves all three pathological characteristics of AD. Interestingly, DHA supplementation does not show these effects in APOE4 carriers, but does in non-carriers.\n Why would fish improve cognitive function in APOE4carriers but supplementing with DHA does not? Dr. Rhonda Patrick suggests that the reason for this is because DHA in fish is in phospholipid form, whereas in a DHA supplement it is not.\n  Phospholipid form of DHA (found in fish) is metabolized to lysophosphatidylcholine (DHA-lysoPC) Non-phospholipid form of DHA (found in DHA supplements) is metabolized to non-esterfied DHA (free DHA)\n The transport of these two types of DHA use different transport mechanisms for entry into the brain. Therefore, Dr. Patrick suggests that the transport of free DHA into the brain of APOE4 carriers is impaired, but the transport of DHA-lysoPC, is not.\n Dr. Rhonda Patrick\u2019s proposal: Providing the brain of APOE4 carriers with DHA-lysoPC may be a way to bypass defective free DHA transport into the brain.\n DHA-lysoPC may in fact be the brain\u2019s preferred source of DHA and it\u2019s been reported that those with low levels of the precursor to DHA-lysoPC can predict mild dementia and AD with 90% accuracy, regardless of APOE4 status.\n In short: the type of DHA found in fish, fish roe, and krill oil has a better chance of getting into the brain of APOE4 carriers.\n  APOE4 in the brain breaks down the integrity and permeability of the BBB through multiple different mechanisms ultimately rendering free DHA transport into the brain very limited. It also decreases cerebral vascularization (i.e. blood supply to the brain). Specifically, APOE4 degrades the tight junctions of the BBB which disrupts the outer membrane leaflet used by free DHA to enter the brain.\n Free DHA improves cognitive function in young APOE4 carriers, but not in older individuals, indicating that age is a factor in the APOE4-mediated deterioration of the BBB.\n In short: the type of DHA in fish oil supplements can not adequately enter the brain in APOE4 carriers, especially in older individuals.\n  Trick question, it doesn\u2019t. DHA-LysoPC bypasses the tight junctions of the BBB and enters the brain via the inner membrane leaflet, therefore regardless of APOE status, DHA-LysoPC should enter the brain despite any degradation caused by APOE4.\n The form of DHA becomes very critical for APOE4 carriers, because this dictates DHA\u2019s entry into our brain.\n  Fish contain ~1\u20131.5% of their omega-3 fatty acids in phospholipid form but fish oil\n Fish roe from salmon, herring, pollock, and flying fish contain high amounts (~38\u201375%) of their omega-3 fatty acids in phospholipid form (mostly as phosphatidylcholine)\n  In phospholipid form, whether DHA is attached to the first or second carbon of the glycerol backbone dictates its break down.\n    This has a much greater chance of accumulating in HDL than LDL, therefore a much greater chance of generating DHA-lysoPC\n  These forms are broken down by pancreatic lipases in the intestines and can both generate free DHA and DHA-lysoPC depending on whether it is resecreted into LDL or HDL, respectively. Compared to the fate of DHA at the sn1 position in phospholipid form, these forms do not generate DHA-lysoPC (the end product we want!) to the same extent. Dr. Patrick suggests the possibility that high dose DHA supplementation could increase the generation of DHA-lysoPC.\n Phospholipid form ends up in circulation as DHA-lysoPC more rapidly than consumption in triglyceride form\n DHA is delivered to the brain in greater abundance when consumed in phospholipid form versus triglyceride\n In summary, APOE4 limits the transport of free DHA (from DHA supplements) into the brain, therefore consuming DHA in phospholipid form to generate DHA-lysoPC (e.g. fish, fish roe, and krill oil) may bypass this faulty transport in APOE4 carriers.",

"note_en": "Lauren Weber and Hannah Recht\t Many covid vaccination registration and information websites at the federal, state and local levels violate disability rights laws, hindering the ability of blind people to sign up for a potentially lifesaving vaccine, a KHN investigation has found.\n Across the country, people who use special software to make the web accessible have been unable to sign up for the vaccines or obtain vital information about covid-19 because many government websites lack required accessibility features. At least 7.6 million people in the U.S. over age 16 have a  visual disability.\n WebAIM, a nonprofit web accessibility organization, checked covid vaccine websites gathered by KHN from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. On Jan. 27, it found accessibility issues on nearly all of 94 webpages, which included general vaccine information, lists of vaccine providers and registration forms.\n In at least seven states, blind residents said they were unable to register for the vaccine through their state or local governments without help. Phone alternatives, when available, have been beset with their own issues, such as long hold times and not being available at all hours like websites.\n Even the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s  Vaccine Administration Management System, which a small number of states and counties opted to use after its  rocky rollout, has been inaccessible for blind users.\n Those problems violate the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which established the right to communications in an accessible format, multiple legal experts and disability advocates said. The federal Americans with Disabilities Act, a civil rights law that prohibits governments and private businesses from discriminating based on disability, further enshrined this protection in 1990.\n Doris Ray, 72, who is blind and has a significant hearing impairment, ran into such issues when she tried to sign up for a vaccine last month with the CDC\u2019s system, used by Arlington County in Virginia. As the outreach director for the  ENDependence Center of Northern Virginia, an advocacy center run by and for people with disabilities, she had qualified for the vaccine because of her in-person work with clients.\n When she used screen-reading technology, which reads a website\u2019s text aloud, the drop-down field to identify her county did not work. She was unable to register for over two weeks, until a colleague helped her.\n \u201cThis is outrageous in the time of a public health emergency, that blind people aren\u2019t able to access something to get vaccinated,\u201d Ray said.\n Mark Riccobono, president of the National Federation of the Blind, wrote to the U.S. Health and Human Services Department in early December, laying out his concerns on vaccine accessibility.\n \u201cA national emergency does not exempt federal, state, and local governments from providing equal access,\u201d  he wrote.\n Dr. Robert Redfield, who was then leading the CDC,  responded that the interim vaccine playbook for health departments included a reminder of the legal requirements for accessible information.\n CDC spokesperson Jasmine Reed said in an email that VAMS is compliant with federal accessibility laws and that the agency requires testing of its services.\n But more than two months into a national vaccine campaign, those on the ground report problems at all levels.\n Some local officials who use VAMS are aware of the ongoing problems and blame the federal government. Arlington Assistant County Manager Bryna Helfer said that because VAMS is run by the federal government the county cannot access the internal workings to troubleshoot the system for blind residents.\n Connecticut Department of Public Health spokesperson Maura Fitzgerald said the state was aware of \u201cmany accessibility issues\u201d with VAMS. She said it had staffed up its call center to handle the problems and was working with the federal government \u201cto improve VAMS and enable the functionality that was promised.\u201d\n Deanna O\u2019Brien, president of the National Federation of the Blind of New Hampshire, said she had heard from blind people unable to use the system. New Hampshire\u2019s health department did not answer KHN questions about the problems.\n Blind people are particularly vulnerable to contracting the covid virus because they often cannot physically distance themselves from others.\n \u201cWhen I go to the grocery store, I do not have the option of walking around and not being near a person,\u201d said  Albert Elia, a blind attorney who works with the San Francisco-based TRE Legal Practice on accessibility cases. \u201cI need a person at the store to assist me in shopping.\u201d\n There is no standardized way to register for a covid vaccine nationwide \u2014 or fix the online accessibility problems. Some states use VAMS; some states have centralized online vaccination registration sites; others have a mix of state-run and locally run websites, or leave it all to local health departments or hospitals. Ultimately, state and local governments are responsible for making their vaccination systems accessible, whether they use the VAMS system or not.\n \u201cOnce those portals open, it\u2019s a race to see who can click the fastest,\u201d Riccobono said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to do things like file a lawsuit, because, at the end of the day, we need to fix it today.\u201d\n Common programming failures that make sites hard to use for the visually impaired included text without enough contrast to distinguish words from the page\u2019s background and images without alternative text explaining what they showed, the WebAIM survey showed. Even worse, portions of the forms on 19 states\u2019 pages were built so that screen readers couldn\u2019t decipher what information a user should enter on search bars or vaccine registration forms.\n The new vaccine pages had more errors than states\u2019  main coronavirus pages but slightly fewer than state government websites in general, said WebAIM Associate Director Jared Smith.\n In Alameda County, California, when Bryan Bashin, 65, who is blind and CEO of the LightHouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired in San Francisco, tried to sign up on Feb. 9 for his vaccine appointment, he encountered multiple hurdles. The appointments slipped away. That night he received an email from the city of Berkeley offering vaccinations. But after two hours struggling with its inaccessible website, all the slots were again taken, he said in an email.\n He was only able to get an appointment after his sighted sister signed him up and has since received his first shot.\n \u201cIt\u2019s an awful bit of discrimination, one as stinging as anything I\u2019ve experienced,\u201d Bashin said.\n Susan Jones, a blind 69-year-old in Indianapolis, had to rely on the Aira app, which allows a sighted person to operate her computer remotely, when she tried to register for her vaccine appointment.\n \u201cI resent that the assumption is that a sighted fairy godmother ought to be there at all times,\u201d said Sheela Gunn-Cushman, a 49-year-old also in Alameda County, who also had to rely on Aira to complete preregistration for a vaccine.\n Emily Creasy, 23, a visually impaired woman in Polk County, Oregon, said she tried unsuccessfully for a month to make the scheduling apparatus work with her screen reader. She finally received her first shot after her mother and roommate helped her.\n Even  Sachin Dev Pavithran, 43, who is blind and executive director of the U.S. Access Board, an independent agency of the federal government that works to increase accessibility, said he struggled to access vaccine registration information in Logan, Utah.\n The Indiana Health Department, Public Health Division of Berkeley and Oregon\u2019s Polk County Public Health did not respond to requests for comment. Utah\u2019s Bear River Health Department did not answer questions on the issue.\n After Alameda County received complaints from users that its site was not compatible with screen readers, officials decided to move away from its preregistration technology, Health Department spokesperson Neetu Balram said in mid-February. The county has since switched to a new form.\n If vaccine accessibility issues are not fixed across the country, though, lawsuits could come next, Elia said. Members of the blind community recently won landmark lawsuits against  Domino\u2019s Pizza and the  Winn-Dixie grocery chain after being unable to order online.\n And, Elia said, \u201cthis is not ordering a pizza \u2014 this is being able to get a potentially lifesaving vaccine.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-21 07:12:10", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u75ab\u82d7,vaccine", "title": "Covid\u75ab\u82d7\u7f51\u7ad9\u8fdd\u53cd\u6b8b\u75be\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f2\u4eba\u521b\u9020\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73 ", "title_en": "Covid Vaccine Websites Violate Disability Laws, Create Inequity for the Blind", "transed": 1, "url": "https://khn.org/news/article/covid-vaccine-websites-violate-disability-laws-create-inequity-for-the-blind/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u75ab\u82d7", "vaccine"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067102, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u65b0\u9c9c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u62e5\u6709\u60a8\u60f3\u8981\u4e86\u89e3FreeBSD\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u7aef\u53e3\uff0c\u5305\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u5207\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u60a8\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u672f\u8bed\u5982\u4f55\u3002\n                                                    8420be8 net / py-pyroute2.protocols\uff1a\u6dfb\u52a0py-pyoute2.protocols 0.6.4pyroute2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7eafPython netlink\u5e93\u3002\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u76f8\u5173\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u7eafpython netlink\u5e93.www\uff1ahttps\uff1a//github.com/svinota/pyroute2/tree/master/ Pyroute2.Protocols.\n 78c72c5 net / py-pyroute2.nslink\uff1a\u6dfb\u52a0py-pyroute2.nslink 0.6.4pyroute2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7eafpython netlink\u5e93\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u4f9b\u7f51\u7ba1\uff0cnspopen\u548cremotesocket\u7c7b.www\uff1ahttps\uff1a//github.com/svinota/pyroute2/tree /master/pyroute2.nslink.\n 89717eb net / py-pyroute2.nftables\uff1a\u6dfb\u52a0py-pyroute2.nftables 0.6.4pyroute2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7eafPython netlink\u5e93\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u4f9b\u975e\u5e38\u57fa\u672c\u7684nftables api.www\uff1ahttps\uff1a//github.com/svinota/pyroute2/tree/master /pyroute2.nftables.\n 7942185 net / py-pyroute2.ndb\uff1a\u6dfb\u52a0py-pyoute2.ndb 0.6.4pyroute2\u662f\u7eafpython netlink library.ndb\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u3002\u5b83\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u6e90\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e8b\u52a1\u6027DB\uff0c\u4ece\u672c\u5730RTNL\u6e90\u5230NetNS\u548c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002 Thedb\u63d0\u4f9bPython API\u548cHTTP RPC\uff08JSON\u548c\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u4f5c\u4e3aAsstandalone\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4f5cPython\u6a21\u5757.www\uff1ahttps://github.com/svinota/pyroute2/tree/master/pyroute2.ndb\n CE3DF07 NET / PY-PYROUTE2.MINIMAL\uff1a\u6dfb\u52a0py-pyroute2.minimal 0.6.4pyroute2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7eafPython netlink\u5e93\u3002\u8fd9\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86Pyroute2\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5b50\u96c6\u3002\u53ea\u6709NetLink Parser\uff0c\u57fa\u672cNetns\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u4e00\u4e9bNetLink\u534f\u8bae\u5b9e\u73b0.www\uff1ahttps\uff1a//github.com/svinota/pyroute2/tree/master/pyroute2.minimal\n 42c316c net / py-pyroute2.ipset\uff1a\u6dfb\u52a0py-pyroute2.ipset 0.6.4pyroute2\u662f\u7eafPython netlink\u5e93\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u4f9bipset\u548cwiset\u7c7b.www\uff1ahttps://github.com/svinota/pyroute2/tree/master /pyroute2.ipset. \n580738D net / py-pyroute2.core\uff1a\u6dfb\u52a0py-pyroute2.core 0.6.4pyroute2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7eafPython netlink\u5e93\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u6838\u5fc3\u5305\uff0c\u5b83\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86NetLink\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u548c\u51e0\u4e2aNetLinkSocket\uff0c\u5305\u62ecRTNL\uff08IProute\uff09\uff0cWioguard\uff0cMPTCP\u7b49 .www\uff1ahttps://github.com/svinota/pyroute2/tree/master/pyroute2.core.  5560319 devel / py-telepath\uff1a\u6dfb\u52a0py-telepath 0.2telepath\u662f\u4e00\u4e2adjango\u5e93\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728Python\u548cJavaScript\u4e4b\u95f4\u4ea4\u6362\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u60a8\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u4fdd\u7559\u5177\u6709\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u5546\u4e1a\u903b\u8f91.www\uff1ahttps\uff1ahttps\uff1ahttps\uff1a //github.com/wagtail/telepath.  4e2f517 devel / jsonnet\uff1a\u66f4\u65b0\u52300.17.0-\u4f7f\u7528cmake\u6765\u6784\u5efa - \u6dfb\u52a0c ++ lib\u548c\u6807\u5934\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9759\u6001libs-\u4f7f\u7528porter\uff06\uff0339;

", "note_en": "Porsche is setting up a new factory for battery cells, called Cellforce, in T\u00fcbingen, Germany. The plant will be run as a subsidiary of Porsche in a joint venture with Customcells\u00a0and will develop  cells that use silicon as opposed to graphite for the anode material.\n &#34;We already started within research and pre-development to build up know how and knowledge about cell chemistry, and the company Cellforce Group will have around 60 engineers in development and about 20 in production; the main focus, at least in the beginning, is to take care about the development of the cell and cell chemistry,&#34; said Michael Steiner, member of the executive board, R&amp;D at Porsche.\n But unlike other  recent battery factory announcements, the goal for Cellforce is high performance, not high volume.\n &#34;In terms of production, [it] will be small compared to all the gigafactories you know, so we are looking forward to have around 100 MWh a year as production capacity\u2014it could be slightly more,&#34; Steiner told Ars. &#34;In terms of cars it should fit for, let me say, 1,000 cars a year. The kind of cells we look for are designed for motorsports and for high-performance derivatives of existing cars, so it&#39;s a very tailored cell technology for high-performance solutions,&#34; he said.\n    &#34;If this works, and we see potential to come down with cost if we scale up\u2014and costs of sales have not only to do with the chemistry but also with the scaling\u2014there might be a chance for higher volume, but this is not a task that I gave the team that has to start this new facility,&#34; Steiner said.\n Porsche is looking for gains in both gravimetric and volumetric energy density but also wants cells that can run hotter than current lithium-ion, like the cells found in Porsche&#39;s Taycan. These currently use &#34;low single-digit percentage&#34; of silicon in the anodes, but Cellforce wants to  increase this to 50 percent if possible.\n &#34;Today&#39;s cell chemistry is able to [operate at] 50\u02da C, maybe slightly higher, and we are looking for temperatures above 70\u02da C that support superfast charging but also superfast driving,&#34; Steiner said. (A downside to the new chemistry is that it doesn&#39;t operate well below freezing, which is a problem for road cars but not for race cars.)\n Porsche wasn&#39;t ready to discuss exactly what race car might first use these new Cellforce cells, something that should happen around 2024. By that time, Porsche&#39;s  hybrid endurance racing program will be up and running alongside its Formula E team.

said Horn, who lived in Oakland before moving into her van. &#34;I had no reason, nothing, tying me to that specific location or that amount of rent.&#34;\n Horn is not alone. Many workers with jobs that let them work remotely during the pandemic left behind their sedentary housing situations and moved full-time into vans. These remote workers drive from location to location in their homes, working from internet hotspots in their vans and spending their free time in nature and exploring new places.\n As vaccines roll out and states start to open up, some workers are returning to their offices. But many workers who&#39;ve adopted the van life don&#39;t want to give it up.\n &#34;It&#39;s become a lifestyle,&#34; said Smriti Bhadauria, who lives in her van with her husband Kartik Vasan and their dog Everest. Bhadauria and Vasan have been traveling in their 1977 Dodge B200 Tradesman since leaving Toronto in August 2020.\n &#34;We&#39;re extremely happy in this life and the freedom it gives,&#34; Bhadauria said. &#34;There&#39;s no deadline in sight.&#34;\n Like overseas backpacking, van life appeals to those with a love for travel or the outdoors who have the privilege to work remotely and the budget to spend thousands of dollars buying and setting up their vans. They can shift the money from rent and car payments toward a lifestyle of endless travel.\n &#34;I&#39;ve always been somebody who loves to travel, but I&#39;m definitely a homebody at the same time,&#34; said Cailey Dillon, who works remotely in customer service for Outdoorsy, a van and RV rental company. &#34;I really like that with the van life you can always be traveling but your home is always with you.&#34;\n       For some, working out of a van is less about travel and more of an alternative to leasing an office.\n Kenzo Fong, CEO of tech start-up Rock, began working out of his van in May 2020 after his children began doing their schoolwork at home during the pandemic. Fong still lives in his San Francisco home, but during the days, he gets into his van and picks a new location in the city. Fong spends his day working out of the desk he&#39;s set up in his van, and takes walking breaks to enjoy the variety of locations and gather his thoughts.\n Fong prefers this to having an hour-long commute each way from San Francisco to Mountain View, California, as he did for his previous job at Google.\n &#34;I just can&#39;t imagine myself doing that again because there&#39;s so much flexibility working from anywhere,&#34; said Fong, whose company builds software for remote workers.\n        Buying and setting up a van can be a quick process. But people who really get into it can spend months or years getting set up.\n Fong, for example, bought an already-converted van and financed it, and pays a couple hundred dollars each month.\n  In contrast, Horn spent months working on her van with her dad and a contractor, setting up the van to the specifications that she wanted. By the end of the project, she had spent about $60,000 -- $25,000 for a used van and another approximate $35,000 on the build.\n Van life vehicles need a few basics: A place to sleep, a desk or table space, kitchen equipment and some sort of bathroom setup.\n But perhaps most important is the computer and internet equipment. Some van lifers only need a laptop. Others have more elaborate set ups complete with multiple monitors. But most carry at least two hot spots from different network providers so they can catch signal from at least one of the services as they hit new locations.\n &#34;Internet is the most important thing,&#34; said Fong, who has a hotspot for AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile. &#34;I basically have all the major carriers in case I need it.&#34;\n These internet requirements sometimes necessitate innovative solutions. Horn recounts finding a great campsite in Sedona, Arizona, but not finding a good signal. So every morning she drove 30 minutes to a nearby town and parked in front of a Staples store where she could finally get a strong connection.\n  Working a nine-to-five job can also be a nuisance for van life workers. For full-timers like Horn, a typical work schedule means they might be parked somewhere gorgeous without being able to enjoy it until the weekend.\n This is why many in the van lifestyle are freelance workers, said Jess Shisler, the founder of Sekr, an app that helps people who live in vans find campsites or wi-fi locations.\n &#34;A nine-to-five is hard but doable,&#34; said Shisler, who also lives in a van. &#34;The type of remote careers that allow you more flexibility of your schedule are easier to do in this lifestyle.&#34;\n  Vasan works in information technology while Bhadauria has a digital marketing job. The two spend the early hours of their days outdoors and then get straight to work. In the afternoon, they&#39;ll take a break from work and explore their area or drive to their next location. No matter what, they prioritize catching the sunset every evening. Ironically, much of their actual work gets done on Saturday and Sunday.\n &#34;We almost never do activities on the weekends because it&#39;s usually crowded, so weekends end up being work days for us,&#34; Vasan said.\n   Dillon said she was surprised at how dirty her van gets. She spent the first four months of 2021 living on the road, and she is now home in Platte City, Missouri, working and preparing to purchase an upgraded van so she can return to her travels sometime this summer. While living in her van, she would clean and clean, but the van would get dirty again as soon as the wind blew. Eventually, Dillon said, you just learn to live a little bit dirtier.\n Another big challenge is dealing with the loneliness that comes with living on the road. Dillon said she felt very lonely during her first three weeks on the road, and it wasn&#39;t until she got her dog Koda that she began to overcome that.\n &#34;I like to be a loner, but it does sometimes get a little too lonely,&#34; she said. &#34;Getting my dog really helped a lot with that loneliness.&#34;\n       Horn said she spends parts of her days doing van chores, such as cleaning and making her bed each day. She also has to empty the van&#39;s grey water tank and portable toilet and refill her fresh water and propane.\n &#34;Most of the moments are not those epic sleeping in the most amazing place and waking up to the most amazing view, it&#39;s very little of that in the grand majority, especially if you&#39;re working,&#34; Horn said. &#34;However, those moments make it worth it.&#34;\n Bhadauria, who travels with her husband and dog, says she doesn&#39;t get lonely, but there are times when she misses the friends that come with living in one location. For example, Bhadauria said, she would have wanted to throw a big party for her husband&#39;s 30th birthday, which happened during their time on the road.\n &#34;Things like that you miss, when you want a big gathering or a sense of community,&#34; Bhadauria said.\n Although she and Vasan love life on the road and plan to continue it for the foreseeable future, they understand the lifestyle is not sustainable indefinitely.\n &#34;With everything you get to a point where things start feeling boring or there&#39;s a burn out at some point,&#34; Bhadauria said. &#34;If we get to that stage, we&#39;ll be happy to go back to a home base somewhere.&#34;\n Despite the challenges of life on the road, those who spoke with CNBC said they plan to continue their nomadic lifestyle until their companies stop allowing remote work or until they get burnt out. Horn said she originally planned to live on the road for at least a year, but that&#39;s now changed.\n &#34;At six months, I still feel like I&#39;m just learning this, just getting the hang of it and just getting started,&#34; she said. &#34;I could actually see myself doing it for closer to two years, and who knows, maybe longer.&#34;\n  Microsoft and partners may be compensated if you purchase something through recommended links in this article.\n                Opens in a new window  Opens an external site  Opens an external site in a new window", "posttime": "2021-06-21 06:24:35", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7ed3\u675f,continue", "title": "\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9501\u5b9a\u7ed3\u675f\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u4eba\u60f3\u7ee7\u7eed\u4ece\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u8d27\u8f66\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u4f5c ", "title_en": "As Lockdowns End, Some Want to Continue Working From Inside Their Vans", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/as-offices-shut-down-for-covid-workers-bought-vans-and-hit-the-road-and-some-dont-want-to-return/ar-AALf52R", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7ed3\u675f", "continue"]}]
