It counts five verticals — including its namesake newsletter, Retail Brew, Marketing Brew, Emerging Tech Brew, and Sidekick — which catapulted Morning Brew from co-founders Austin Rief and Alex Lieberman&#39;s simple college listserv to a media company that was acquired by Insider in October for a reported $75 million.</p><p>早上酿造isn＆＃39; t只是一个新闻通讯，它＆＃39;是一个兴奋的电子邮件帝国。它有五个垂直 - 包括其名称时事通讯，零售业，营销酿造，新兴的技术酿造和Sidekick  - 来自联合创始人奥斯汀·雷菲和亚历克斯莱伯曼＆＃39; S简单的学院列入被收购的媒体公司由Insider于10月份报告7500万美元。</p><p> The ad-based, free subscription business model seems simple enough at first glance, but what makes Morning Brew stand out are the lessons it&#39;s learned from new media and the rise of the creator economy, as well as its strong branding efforts on social media. While Morning Brew is comfortably winning the newsletter game and is in no rush to spread itself thin, Rief&#39;s vision for the future of the company is as much about creators, branding and subscription-based revenue as it is about providing you a valuable resource in your inbox every morning.</p><p> 广告的免费订阅商业模式乍一看似乎很简单，但是让早晨酿造脱颖而出的是课程＆＃39;从新媒体中学到的课程和创造者经济的兴起，以及其强大的品牌努力在社交媒体上。虽然早上酿造了令人舒服地赢得了时事通讯游戏，并且急于传播薄，褶皱和＃39;对于公司未来的愿景与建筑商，品牌和订阅的收入一样多，因为它是关于为您提供的每天早上收件箱中的宝贵资源。</p><p> The Business of Business spoke to Rief about the history of Morning Brew and his read on the current media landscape — which is rife with layoffs and mergers — as well as where he sees his company fitting in.</p><p> 业务的业务与雷迪克关于早晨酿造的历史和他对当前媒体景观的读书 - 以及裁员和兼并的习惯 - 以及他认为他的公司适合的地方。</p><p>  Could you talk about the history of Morning Brew, from the original idea to the deal with Business Insider?</p><p>  你能谈谈早晨酿造的历史，从原始想法到商业内幕交易吗？</p><p> Morning Brew technically started in 2014. When I heard about it, it wasn’t even a newsletter at the time, but a PDF attachment that was going around the University of Michigan that was trying to make the business world seem more conversational and interesting. And so I signed up. One day, the writer of that, Alex Lieberman, sent out an email saying, “Hey, I&#39;m looking to go take this a step further, who&#39;s interested?” I saw potential in it, so we joined up. And to make a long story short, we spent winter break of 2014 into 2015 at the University of Michigan working on this. On March 14 it [was] the six year anniversary of Morning Brew. The idea was to empower and educate young business professionals. It really was college students at first, and we quickly learned that this can be attractive for young business professionals as well. And that was kind of our “aha” moment of like, “Oh, this is bigger than just college students. This is for everyone.”</p><p> 早上在2014年开始锻炼。当我听说过它时，甚至是当时的时事通讯，而是在密歇根大学的围绕，这是一个试图让商业世界更加对话和有趣的PDF依恋。所以我报名了。有一天，那个作家，亚历克斯莱伯曼，发出一封电子邮件，“嘿，我＆＃39;我想进一步走这一步，谁＆＃39;兴趣？”我看到它的潜力，所以我们加入了。并缩短了长篇大论，我们将于2015年休息进入2015年，在密歇根大学工作。 3月14日，早晨酿造的六周年。这个想法是赋予和教育年轻的商业专业人士。它起初真的是大学生，我们很快就得知，对于年轻的商业专业人士而言，这也可以吸引。那是我们的“啊哈”时刻，“哦，这比大学生更大。这是为每个人的。“</p><p> I was a sophomore and Alex was a senior. He went to work at Morgan Stanley for a year and I interned at an investment bank. And quickly we realized that this    was   something. We didn’t know what and we don&#39;t know what the potential was, but there was too much progress to not continue going. So we did. I spent my entire senior year working on it, and then went full time in 2017. We raised a small convertible note, and we were off to the races. Until the end of 2018, we did nothing besides write, sell and grow the daily email newsletter to get it to about a million subscribers. We had our one million party two years ago now. So that was the first couple years: Just a single newsletter and being hyper, hyper focused on one product.</p><p> 我是一位大学生，亚历克斯是一名高级。他在摩根斯坦利上班了一年，我在投资银行私奔。我们很快意识到这是某种东西。我们不知道是什么，我们不知道潜力是什么，但没有继续前进的进展太多了。所以我们做到了。我花了我整个高级工作的工作，然后在2017年全职。我们提出了一个小型可换股票据，我们已经去了比赛。直到2018年底，除了写作，销售和发展日常电子邮件时事通讯中，我们还没有任何作用以使其到大约一百万的订阅者。我们两年前有一百万派对。所以这是第一夫一年的几年：只是单一的通讯和超级，超专注于一个产品。</p><p> So from zero to one million, was it just you and Alex working on the newsletter?</p><p> 所以从零到一百万，是你和亚历克斯在通讯上工作吗？ </p><p> In 2017, we brought on our first two employees. One was a writer, and one was a jack of all trades: A little product, a little tech, a little engineering, a little bit of everything. Then we quickly grew to another writer. We were a very lean team, but there’s been a lot of growth. In the last 15 months, we went from 25 to 86 people.</p><p>2017年，我们带来了我们的前两名员工。一个是作家，一个是所有交易的杰克：一点产品，一点技术，一点工程，一点点一切。然后我们迅速增长了另一个作家。我们是一个非常精益的团队，但是有很多增长。在过去的15个月里，我们从25岁到86人。</p><p> How did the deal with Insider come to be, and how does Morning Brew operate as a part of the larger company?</p><p> 与内幕人的交易是如何发展的，早上酿造作为较大公司的一部分？</p><p> We started getting a bunch of offers around 2018, but we didn’t think they were that interesting, and we had no intention of selling the business. But [Axel Springer] was persistent, and they reached out and COVID happened. We have really big ambitions and want to be aggressive in what we’re doing, and having the backing of a large company that&#39;s gonna allow you to take risks was attractive to us. We had no idea if there was gonna be a second wave of COVID that was gonna affect things, or maybe an economic recession. We&#39;re in an ads business, and ads businesses are quite volatile. They&#39;re not recession proof at all. And to have the opportunity to have the same ambition, if not bigger, but have some stability, and some economic backing was really, really great for us. So we&#39;re an independent company within the Axel Springer family. We have our own HR — we don&#39;t share anything in terms of staff. In the grand scheme of being owned by a $12 billion company, we&#39;re pretty autonomous.</p><p> 我们开始获得2018年左右的一堆优惠，但我们不认为他们是这种有趣的，我们无意销售业务。但是[Axel Springer]持续存在，他们伸出了，碰巧发生了。我们有很大的抱负，并希望在我们正在做的事情上咄咄逼人，并且有一个大公司的支持，允许您冒险对我们有吸引力。我们不知道是否会有一个第二波Covid，这会影响事情，或者可能是一个经济衰退。我们＆＃39;在广告业务中，广告业务非常挥发。他们根本没有经济衰退证明。并有机会拥有相同的野心，如果没有更大，但有一些稳定，而且一些经济支持真的，真的很棒。所以我们＆＃39;在Axel Springer家族内进行独立公司。我们有自己的人力资源 - 我们在工作人员方面分享任何东西。在盛大的盛大计划，我们拥有120亿美元的公司，我们非常自主。</p><p> If you look at media acquisitions like BuzzFeed and Huffington Post just this week, you see the complete opposite of that. So how important was it to you to be able to keep a level of autonomy when you were making the deal with Insider?</p><p> 如果您在本周看类似Buzzfeed和Huffington Post这样的媒体收购，那么您可以看到完全相反。那么你能够在与内幕交易交易时能够保持自主程度如何才能保持自主的重要性？</p><p>  You mentioned that you received a lot of offers. What made you turn down certain deals and eventually say yes to Insider?</p><p>  你提到你收到了很多优惠。是什么让你拒绝某个交易，最终对内幕人说是的？</p><p> Obviously, price mattered. As did finding partners we felt comfortable working with. At the end of day when you&#39;re a media company, you can only sell to one of three entities. You can sell to a vertical integration play, like Hustle just sold to HubSpot, you can sell to a private equity company, or you can sell to a media conglomerate. There are pros and cons of all three. The pros of selling to a vertical integration like Hubspot is that they could have the highest willingness to pay because they have quite high revenue multiples on the business. But there are cons. They may not value everyone at your company, and so they may have to make some adjustments. Private equity probably will pay the lowest multiple. They&#39;re very focused on EBITDA, and not focused as much on growth oftentimes. And there&#39;s the media conglomerate, which is kind of in the middle. And so we spoke to people in all three of those buckets. So of everyone, we thought Axel Springer was the best business to sell to.</p><p> 显然，价格问题。找到合作伙伴，我们感到舒服地使用。在您＆＃39;重新媒体公司的一天结束时，您只能出售到三个实体中的一个。您可以销售给垂直集成玩，就像刚刚卖给Hubspot的喧嚣，你可以卖给私募股权公司，或者你可以卖给媒体集团。所有三个都有利弊。销售与HUBPOT这样的垂直整合的利得是他们可能拥有最高的支付意愿，因为它们具有相当高的收入倍数。但有缺点。他们可能不会重视贵公司的每个人，因此他们可能必须进行一些调整。私募股权可能会支付最低倍数。他们非常专注于EBITDA，并没有重点关注增长。和＃39;媒体集团，这是中间的一种。所以我们与所有三个桶中的人交谈。所以每个人都认为Axel Springer是销售的最佳业务。</p><p> Why didn’t Morning Brew go the route of a paid subscription? Do you consider yourselves to be more of a tech company, or more of a media company?</p><p> 为什么早上没有酿造的是付费订阅的路线？您认为自己是更像是技术公司，或更多媒体公司吗？ </p><p> I don&#39;t really worry about labels so much. I mean, maybe we&#39;re a media company. But I think media and commerce — it&#39;s all converging. And we will absolutely look, at some point, to launch a subscription service or something that will get direct revenue from our user, whether it&#39;s a subscription or a one off paid thing. It&#39;s about finding the best business model for us. We&#39;re gonna explore a lot of different revenue opportunities, but we still see so much room to go in the ad-based business. We want to get this right and then expand — we don&#39;t want to also get into commerce and subscription and everything in the same year. It&#39;s just too much.</p><p>我不太担心标签非常担心。我的意思是，也许我们＆＃39;重新媒体公司。但我认为媒体和商业 - 它均收敛＆＃39;在某些时候，我们将绝对看，推出订阅服务或将从我们的用户提供直接收入的东西，无论是订阅还是一个关注的东西。关于为我们找到最佳商业模式的IT＆＃39。我们＆＃39;重新探讨了许多不同的收入机会，但我们仍然看到了这么多的房间可以参与基于广告的业务。我们希望得到这个权利然后扩展 - 我们不想进入同年的商业和订阅和所有内容。它＆＃39; s太多了。</p><p> You often hear that the ad-based business model is dying out. How has Morning Brew been able to make it work when others haven’t?</p><p> 您经常听到广告的商业模式正在消亡。谁在别人没有？</p><p> I don&#39;t think ad-based businesses are bad businesses. Is that the best business model in the world? No, of course not. But it works. What I think is probably overriding that narrative is the fact that a lot of these businesses aren&#39;t well run. They&#39;re over capitalized, they&#39;re inefficient, they don&#39;t truly have a real audience. So if you want a real audience, you definitely can&#39;t monetize for subscriptions; you&#39;re going to try to monetize through advertising. And people don&#39;t want to spend money if nobody’s really engaging [with the product]. And all of a sudden, [people will say] “Oh, ad businesses aren&#39;t good.”</p><p> 我不认为广告的业务是坏业务。这是世界上最好的商业模式吗？不，当然不是。但它有效。我认为最重要的是，叙述是很多这些企业逃离的事实＆＃39;跑得很好。他们＆＃39;重新获得资本化，他们效率低下，他们没有真正拥有真正的观众。所以如果你想要一个真正的观众，你肯定可以＆＃39; t货币化为订阅;你将尝试通过广告批准。如果没有人真的从事[与产品]，人们不想花钱。突然间，[人们会说]“哦，广告企业aren＆＃39; t好。”</p><p>  &#34;I f people come to your site just because they find you in a Google search, and you&#39;re not providing utility to them? Well, then you don’t have an audience. T hat game is a race to the bottom.&#34; — Rief</p><p>  ＆＃34;我是人们来到你的网站，因为他们在谷歌搜索中找到你，你＆＃39;重复没有向他们提供实用性？好吧，那么你没有受众。 T帽游戏是底部的比赛。＆＃34; - 雷费</p><p>   But a lot of these businesses out there that are ad businesses    could   be good if they didn&#39;t have to live up to the valuations on the capital they raised in 2016 or 2017. And by the way, it&#39;s unfortunate because a lot of times people are getting laid off. And these companies are struggling because of mistakes that execs made years ago that really hurt their ability to succeed today.</p><p>   但是，如果他们在2016年或2017年他们提出的资本估值，那么许多这些业务可能是良好的因为很多时候人们都被撤销了。这些公司因犯罪而犯了几年前的错误，这些公司正在努力损害他们今天的成功能力。</p><p> I can think of several companies that have gone through the wringer of M&amp;A, and have ended up in a rough state today. The first one that comes to mind is Gawker, which became Gizmodo, which is now G/O. If you look at those sites, it&#39;s an ad-based business. But over the years, it&#39;s changed from “The ads are there” to the ad  dominating the page, and you see writers and readers at that site complaining about how the user experience has become really bad.  How do you find the balance between the actual content of your newsletters and the parts that generate revenue?</p><p> 我可以想到几家经历了M＆amp的绞刑所的公司;今天已经陷入了艰难的状态。这个想到的第一个是Gawker，它成为Gizmodo，现在是G / O.如果您查看这些网站，它＆＃39;是一个基于广告的业务。但多年来，它与“广告”的改变为主导页面的广告，你看到那个网站的作家和读者抱怨用户体验如何变得非常糟糕。如何在新闻通讯的实际内容与产生收入的零件之间找到平衡？</p><p> We think about this a lot. It&#39;s a very careful balance to get that right. There&#39;s no right or wrong answer. What I will say is that I think that comparison to some of those other companies is not a great one. Because if people come to your site just because they find you in a Google search, and you&#39;re not providing utility to them? Well, then you don’t have an audience. So people aren’t more likely to click on your advertisements than any other advertisement, and you’re just monetizing through standard programmatics. So yeah, that game is a race to the bottom. But when your ad units are actually additive to the content — some of our advertisements 5% or 6%, click through rates. That&#39;s incredible. It just shows that we&#39;re working with the right companies, we have the right message, and it&#39;s on brand. And our audience actually at times finds it useful to get recommendations from us. And so it really does depend on how engaged the audience is, how much they trust, what you say, and things like that.</p><p> 我们考虑了这一点。它＆＃39;非常谨慎的平衡来实现这一权利。没有权利或错误的答案。我会说的是，我认为与其他一些公司的比较不是一个伟大的公司。因为如果人们来到你的网站，因为他们在谷歌搜索中找到你，而且你＆＃39;重复没有向他们提供实用性？好吧，那么你没有受众。因此，人们不太可能从任何其他广告点击广告，而且您只需通过标准程序分散机制。所以是的，那场比赛是底部的比赛。但是，当您的广告单位实际添加到内容中 - 我们的一些广告5％或6％，点击率。 ＆＃39; s令人难以置信。它只是表明我们与合适的公司合作，我们有正确的信息，它＆＃39;在品牌上。我们的观众实际上有时会发现获得我们的建议很有用。因此，它真的取决于观众的学习如何，他们信任多少，你所说的，这样的事情。 </p><p>  Something I see Morning Brew doing to help build that trust is developing social media personalities that aren’t specifically attached to the brand. I see it with your Twitter and with other people at the company. How important is it to you and to the team overall to have individual presences?</p><p>我认为早上的东西可以帮助建立这种信任正在发展不具体依附于该品牌的社交媒体个性。我用你的推特和公司的其他人看到它。对您和团队总体上有个别的顾客有多重要？</p><p> It&#39;s incredibly important. That&#39;s where we&#39;re going, right? We&#39;re going to a place where we are going to have what I like to call an army of personalities. We&#39;re going to leverage the Morning Brew brand to help accelerate and push their content forward.</p><p> 它＆＃39;非常重要。那个＆＃39;我们在哪里＆＃39;重新走，对吗？我们和我们要在那里召唤一个人的个性，我们将要去一个地方。我们＆＃39;重新利用早上的酿造品牌，帮助加速和推动他们的内容。</p><p> To take a step back, the plan for the future is just to do two things that are simple, but not easy. The first thing is to make people smarter and better at their job. And that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing in the B2B business. That&#39;s Retail Brew, that’s Marketing Brew — it&#39;s anything else we launched that’s in business. That&#39;s part one. Part two is the B2C business. We&#39;re going to take the Morning Brew consumer and we&#39;re going to start to think about the other things that that person would like from us, whether it’s personal finance, productivity, or investing content. All of that is all going to incorporate personality and people. For us, personality is huge. It&#39;s incredibly important.</p><p> 要退后一步，未来的计划只是为了做两个简单的事情，但并不容易。第一件事是让人们更聪明，更好地工作。那个＆＃39;我们在B2B业务中做了什么。 ＆＃39;零售酿造，营销酿造 - 它＆＃39;我们在商业中推出的任何其他东西。第一部分和＃39;第二部分是B2C业务。我们将参加早晨酿造消费者和我们＆＃39;重新开始思考那个人希望来自美国的其他事情，无论是个人财务，生产力还是投资内容。所有这一切都将纳入人格和人。对我们来说，个性是巨大的。它＆＃39;非常重要。</p><p> Something I noticed that the Morning Brew Twitter account does is that it uses the language of the platform, if that makes sense. I really see Morning Brew engaging with the language that I see regular users use on Twitter. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the social media strategy and how it&#39;s paid off?</p><p> 我注意到早上啤酒推特账户的东西是它使用平台的语言，如果这有意义。我真的看到早上酿造与我看到经常用户在推特上使用的语言。所以我想知道你是否可以谈论社交媒体策略以及它的报酬如何谈论它？</p><p> It started very organically. At the end of day, your social media managers are people, and you need to lean into that because people resonate and empathize and listen to other people — not brands. Brands can augment, but [readers] really want people and not just the brand.</p><p> 它非常有机地开始。在一天结束时，您的社交媒体经理是人，您需要倾向于，因为人们共鸣和同情并听取其他人 - 而不是品牌。品牌可以增强，但[读者]真的想要人而不仅仅是品牌。</p><p> The brand clearly has grown a ton. You can just feel it, right? You can&#39;t measure it, per se, although we have sold some ads on Twitter and on Instagram. So it&#39;s working from a monetary perspective. But it’s still such early days. I think you&#39;re gonna look back in three years, and be like, “Oh, wow, people thought Morning Brew in 2021 was big, but that was nothing.” [The newsletters] are just one product, and we&#39;re gonna have the same impact on social media that we had on newsletters. And that&#39;s when we&#39;ll be really successful. That&#39;s when we will have gotten to where we want to be.</p><p> 品牌显然已经增长了一吨。你可以感受到它，对吗？您可以使用它，虽然我们在Twitter和Instagram上销售了一些广告。所以它＆＃39;从货币角度工作。但它仍然是早期的初期。我认为你＆＃39;重新回顾三年，就像，“哦，哇，人们认为早上在2021年酝酿很大，但那是什么都没有。” [新闻稿]只是一个产品，我们与我们在新闻通讯中的社交媒体对社交媒体产生相同的影响。当我们＆＃39; ll真的成功时，它＆＃39;那个＆＃39;我们将在我们想要的地方。</p><p>  I&#39;d like to pick your brain about the future of online media in general. In the last few years, you saw a big migration to platforms like Patreon, and now again with Substack. We’re in the midst of a strange decay of legacy media that also extends to sites that started in the dot com era, or even after. But in the middle of all that, Morning Brew is rising. Where do you see things going, and how does Morning Brew fit in?</p><p>  我喜欢挑选你的大脑，一般来说在线媒体的未来。在过去的几年里，你看到了帕勒顿等平台的大迁移，现在再次用餐。我们在遗产媒体的一个奇怪衰减中，也扩展到在DOT COM时代开始的网站，甚至是之后。但在中间，早上啤酒正在上升。你在哪里看到的事情，早上酿造乐趣？ </p><p> So I think there&#39;s like two separate parts: There&#39;s the capital J journalism part, and there&#39;s media and content in general. I do think journalism is in trouble. The business model is not one that works for most people. It works if you&#39;re the New York Times, and it works if you’re super niche. But I&#39;ve never been more optimistic about media as a whole.</p><p>所以我认为有两个独立的部分：首都J新闻部门，以及一般的媒体和内容的首都J新闻部门＆＃39;我认为新闻遇到了麻烦。商业模式不是大多数人适用的模式。如果您＆＃39;重新纽约时报，它有效，如果您是超级利基。但是，我从来没有更乐观的媒体。</p><p>  &#34;W e [have to] add so much value to a creator that they feel a need to stay at Morning Brew.  We have to do all these things to make us a really attractive option compared to going independent.&#34; — Rief</p><p>  ＆＃34; w e [必须]为创造者增加了如此多的价值，他们认为他们需要留在早晨啤酒。与与独立相比，我们必须完成所有这些事情，使我们成为一个非常有吸引力的选择。＆＃34; - 雷费</p><p>   People ask me, “What&#39;s going to be successful? Twitter, or Substack? Or something else?” And the answer is that everything will be successful in different ways. But the world is so much better when we have millions of content creators. The whole world&#39;s going more niche, because when you have zero marginal cost to create content, the economics change completely. We will have real, true abundance because you can reach anyone, anywhere in the world, with the click of a mouse. So it&#39;s going to be about being the best and being as niche as possible. We’re already seeing this, where it&#39;s not just people who work at news organizations — people    are   news organizations now. I think that&#39;s the future of media — not the future of journalism, but the future media. I don’t believe that Substack’s vision is to poach a million journalists from New York Times — it&#39;s to create a million new content creators. And that&#39;s a really exciting world where we have people creating content in their area of expertise, whether it&#39;s audio, video, YouTube, Substack, whatever works for them and their content. Like to me, that&#39;s a really exciting world to be a part of.</p><p>   人们问我，“什么零生成功？ Twitter，或者家用？或者是其他东西？”答案是，一切都将以不同的方式成功。但是当我们有数百万内容创作者时，世界就会好多了。整个世界＆＃39;走得更大的利基，因为当你有零边际成本来创造内容时，经济学完全变化。我们将拥有真实的丰富，因为您可以在世界任何地方到达世界任何地方，点击鼠标。所以它会成为最好的，也是尽可能的利基。我们已经看到了这一点，它在哪里＆＃39;不仅仅是在新闻机构工作的人 - 人们现在是新闻机构。我认为媒体的未来 - 不是新闻的未来，而是未来的媒体。我不相信家喻阀的愿景是从纽约时报挖出一百万名记者 - 它＆＃39; s创建一百万个新内容创作者。而且，它是一个非常令人兴奋的世界，我们有人们在他们的专业领域创造内容，无论是＆＃39; s音频，视频，youtube，seatack，无论它们及其内容为何。对我来说，这是一个真正令人兴奋的世界是一部分。</p><p> Do you see the current model of journalism coexisting with this world of content creators?</p><p> 您是否看到了当前的新闻模型与这个内容创作者的世界共存？</p><p> Here&#39;s the tough part. A lot of these content creators can&#39;t do their job without journalists. Most of them are doing analysis. And if you don&#39;t have things that are reported on, then you can&#39;t do your analysis. Now, I don&#39;t have a solution for that. I do think the big players like the Times are going to get much, much bigger. I think the middle of the barbell is in big trouble. Big trouble. But the top will always be there. The Times is always going to have its place, even if they fund their journalism through recipes and games. But this whole ecosystem all relies on one journalist doing their job, so there is an issue here that we will have to solve.</p><p> 在这里艰难的部分＆＃39。很多这些内容创造者可以在没有记者的情况下做他们的工作。大多数都在进行分析。如果你没有＆＃39; t有报告的东西，那么你可以＆＃39; t做你的分析。现在，我没有对此解决方案。我认为像时代这样的大玩家将得到太多，更大。我认为杠铃的中间有很大的麻烦。大麻烦。但是顶部永远在那里。即使他们通过食谱和游戏为他们的新闻资助，时期总是会有它的地方。但这整个生态系统都依赖于一名记者做工作，所以这里有一个问题，我们将必须解决。</p><p> How do you, as an employer, avoid the situation that you&#39;re seeing a lot of traditional media go through now where you have writers who rise to great prominence and then decide, “Thanks to the Times or Morning Brew, I have grown my own personal audience big enough that now I can break off and start my own Substack.” Is that something you’re thinking about? How do you keep those people attached?</p><p> 作为雇主，你如何避免你看到很多传统媒体的情况，现在在哪里看待很多传统媒体，在那里你有突出的作家，然后决定，“感谢时代或早上啤酒，我有他自己的个人观众足够大，现在我可以脱掉自己的食物。“是你正在考虑的东西吗？你如何保留那些附着的人？</p><p> We have to create this flywheel such that we can add so much value to a creator that they feel a need to stay at Morning Brew. We provide distribution, we provide them with audio editing, video editing, we provide them a salary. We can help monetize them in seven ways while they can only monetize themselves in one, which means we can pay them more than if they were on their own. We have to do all these things to make us a really attractive option compared to going independent. With that being said, there are going to be people who, no matter what we do, can go out on their own and make enough money.</p><p> 我们必须创建这个飞轮，这样我们就可以为创造者添加如此多的价值，以至于他们认为需要留在早晨啤酒的创造者。我们提供分销，我们为他们提供音频编辑，视频编辑，我们为他们提供了一个薪水。我们可以帮助在七种方式中通过七种方式将其批准，而他们只能在其中货币化，这意味着我们可以超过他们的支付超过他们自己的费用。与与独立相比，我们必须做所有这些都是一个非常有吸引力的选择。有了那个说，无论我们所做的，都有人，可以自己出去，赚了足够的钱。 </p><p> Do I worry about that? Sure. But that&#39;s a good problem to have, right? We have to make sure that Morning Brew is not just giving up our brand to them, but they&#39;re bringing their brands to Morning Brew. But if you lose a creator for the right reasons, you&#39;re doing okay. You&#39;re actually pretty damn good. You know, I would love to have that problem of losing creators because they have this really difficult decision of staying at Morning Brew or making way more money going out and doing their own podcasts or their own newsletter.</p><p>我担心吗？当然。但是那个有一个很好的问题，对吗？我们必须确保早上的酿造不只是放弃我们的品牌，而是他们将他们的品牌带到了早晨啤酒。但如果你因为正确的原因丢失了创造者，你＆＃39;再做好。你＆＃39;真的很漂亮。你知道，我很乐意让那个失去创造者的问题，因为他们有这个真正艰难的决定在早晨酿造或让更多的资金出去并做自己的播客或他们自己的时事通讯。</p><p> When I interviewed Alex Cohen, he said something that struck me as interesting. He comes from a FinTech background, and FinTech companies are making millions right now. But if you asked him if now is a good time to start a FinTech company, he pretty strongly argues that no, it isn’t. So I want to throw the question to you. Is now a good time to start a media company?</p><p> 当我采访亚历克斯科恩时，他说一些让我感兴趣的东西。他来自Fintech背景，Fintech公司现在正在制作数百万美元。但如果你问他现在是开始一个Fintech公司的好时机，他非常强烈地争辩说，这不是。所以我想向你抛出问题。现在是开始媒体公司的好时机吗？</p><p> Yes, it&#39;s a great time to build an audience, and a great time to start a media company. I don&#39;t necessarily agree with Alex — I think if you have a good idea, and you can execute, it&#39;s never a bad time to do something, right? Maybe it&#39;ll take you another year or two years until the market turns, but things go in cycles. People will fund things or they won’t fund things. People will buy things or they won’t buy things. But to me, it&#39;s always a good time to start something. I mean, I started a rolling fund because I believe in that. There&#39;s so many incredible people out there building great companies.</p><p> 是的，它＆＃39;是建立观众的好时机，以及开始媒体公司的美好时机。我不一定同意亚历克斯 - 我觉得如果你有一个好主意，你可以执行，它和＃39;从未做过的事情，对吧？也许它＆＃39;如果市场转弯，但事情会带来两年，但事情进入周期。人们将资助事物或他们不会为事物提供资金。人们会买东西或他们不会买东西。但对我来说，它＆＃39;总是一个开始一些东西的好时机。我的意思是，我开始了一个滚动基金，因为我相信。在那里建立了很多令人难以置信的人的伟大公司。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessofbusiness.com/videos/austin-rief-how-morning-brew-went-from-college-newsletter-to-75-million/">https://www.businessofbusiness.com/videos/austin-rief-how-morning-brew-went-from-college-newsletter-to-75-million/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/大学/">#大学</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/酿造/">#酿造</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/brew/">#brew</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/媒体/">#媒体</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
