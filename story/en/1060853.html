In early 2000, GE passed Microsoft to become the world’s most valuable company. The sprawling conglomerate, which sold everything from jet engines to mortgages to advertising on  Seinfeld, was directed by a dynamic CEO, Jack Welch, and his unwavering faith in the power of Six Sigma.</p><p>二十年前，没有公司飞行高于一般电气。 2000年初，葛通过微软成为世界上最有价值的公司。庞大的集团，其中从喷气发动机向抵押贷款到Seinfeld的广告，由动态CEO，Jack Welch和他坚定信在六西格玛的力量中引导。</p><p> Six Sigma, at its core, is a system for eliminating defects in manufacturing. The name refers to a statistical model, based on deviations on a bell curve, that dictates the number of acceptable defects per million manufacturing steps. Achieving Six Sigma means an organization tolerates just 3.4 defects per million steps, insisting that 99.99966% of its products or services are without flaws. Historically, most industrial companies operate between three and four sigma, making them between 93% and 99.3% defect-free (these figures can vary slightly depending on the statistical model).</p><p> 六西格玛在其核心，是一种消除制造业缺陷的系统。该名称是指基于钟曲线上的偏差的统计模型，其决定了每百万百万制造步骤的可接受缺陷的数量。实现六西格玛意味着一个组织仅容忍每百万个步骤的3.4个缺陷，坚持其产品或服务的99.99966％没有缺陷。从历史上看，大多数工业公司在三个和四个西格玛之间运作，使其在93％至99.3％之间无缺陷（这些数字可以根据统计模型略有不同）。</p><p> GE adopted Six Sigma from Motorola in 1995, and under Welch it became corporate religion. The company  invested more than $1 billion in training thousands of employees, and the system was adopted by every GE business unit. Tools designed to streamline the making of widgets were adopted for every company process, from accounting to customer service to hiring.</p><p> GE于1995年从摩托罗拉采用六西格玛，并在Welch下成为企业宗教。该公司投资超过10亿美元的培训数千名员工，每个GE业务部门采用该系统。旨在简化小部件制作的工具是为每个公司流程而采用的，从会计到客户服务到招聘。</p><p> With GE as its poster child, the gospel of Six Sigma was spread by management consultants to companies everywhere. Its statistical sheen and rankings borrowed from martial arts—newbies were “green belts,” masters were “black belts”—was tailor-made for a business world that loves jargon and management pseudo-science. Soon, Six Sigma was the must-have credential, appearing on countless resumes and feeding a cottage industry of training institutes. Other quality-oriented systems proliferated in Six Sigma’s shadow: Lean, Total Quality Management, and ISO 9000 all jumped from the specialized world of process engineering to the broader business world.</p><p> 随着GE作为其海报儿童，六西格玛的福音通过管理顾问向各地的公司传播。它的统计光泽和排名从武术 - 新手借来的是“绿皮带”，硕士学位是“黑带” - 为一个喜欢Jargon和Management Pseudo-Science的商业世界量身定制的。很快，六西格玛是必有的凭证，出现在无数的恢复和喂养训练机构的山寨行业。其他以六西格玛的影子增殖的其他质量为导向的系统：精益，全面管理，ISO 9000均跳跃于更广阔的商业世界的流程工程。</p><p> But as GE began a long, slow decline, so did the popularity of Six Sigma. Once synonymous with management excellence, GE’s reputation in the business world plummeted in concert with its share price. The business press, once effusive in its praise, began asking “ What the hell happened at GE?”  In the latest blow, accounting expert Harry Markopolos, who tried to warn the world about Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme, has  accused GE of disguising the depths of its problems. (The company, in turn, accuses Markopolos of working for short-sellers who would profit from its decline.)</p><p> 但随着GE开始长，跌幅缓慢，六西格玛的普及也是如此。一旦同义于管理卓越管理，GE在商业世界中的声誉与其股价举行了音乐会。商业出版社，一旦赞美，一旦赞美，开始询问“GE发生了什么事？”在最新的打击中，哈里·马克诺多试图向全世界警告伯尔尼麦多夫的PONZ​​I计划，已经指责GE掩盖其问题的深度。 （公司反过来，指责Markopolos为将从其下降中获利的短卖家工作。）</p><p> The company’s market cap, which reached a high of nearly $600 billion in mid-2000, sank to around $60 billion late last year.</p><p> 该公司的市场概率于2000年中期达到近6000亿美元，沉没在去年年底为600亿美元。</p><p>   According to Google,  searches for “Six Sigma” peaked in 2004, and have fallen steadily since. LinkedIn data reveal a similar story, with fewer and fewer of its 630 million users adding Six Sigma as a skill to their online résumés. It’s since been surpassed by Agile, a management process that emerged from the world of software development.</p><p>   根据谷歌，在2004年寻找“六西格玛”，自从此稳步下降。 LinkedIn数据揭示了类似的故事，其6.3亿用户较少，较少，将六西格玛作为其在线简历。自从敏捷，它是从软件开发世界出现的管理过程。 </p><p>    Eric Abrahamson, a Columbia business professor who studies management trends, distinguishes between fads and fashions. While fads bubble up organically, management fashions are manufactured and promulgated by consultants and business schools who profit from their adoption. Six Sigma was a classic management fashion, Abrahamson says, and GE was its leading model, a high-performing company touted by consultants eager to help other firms implement the system. As a result, it spread widely.</p><p>埃里克·亚伯拉罕，哥伦比亚商业教授研究管理趋势，区分了时尚和时尚。虽然FADS有机冒泡，但管理时尚由顾问和商业学院制造，并颁布，他们从采用中获利。六西格玛是一个经典的管理时尚，亚伯拉罕森说，GE是其领先的模式，这是一个高性能的公司被顾问渴望帮助其他公司实施系统。结果，它广泛传播。</p><p> “The merchants of Six Sigma wanted to keep expanding the market,” Abrahamson says. “You don’t want to just sell it to manufacturing firms, you want to sell it to service firms, to financial firms, to government agencies, to nonprofits.”</p><p> “六西格玛的商人希望继续扩大市场，”亚伯拉罕森说。 “您不想将其销售给制造公司，您希望将其销售给服务公司，向金融公司到政府机构到非营利组织。”</p><p>  And as with all fashions, once Six Sigma was picked up by the masses, fashionable companies lost interest and moved on to the next big thing. “These things have a life cycle: They get popular and then people start looking for something else,” says Art Swersey, a professor emeritus of operations research at the Yale School of Management. “These things run their course, and it has run its course.”</p><p>  与所有时尚一样，群众接受了六西格玛，时兴公司失去了兴趣并搬到了下一个大事。 “这些东西有生命周期：他们流行，然后人们开始寻找别的东西，”耶鲁管理学院的业务研究教授艺术扫打艺术表示，“艺术扫斯说。 “这些东西运行他们的课程，它已经运行了课程。”</p><p> Six Sigma’s decline was also a symptom of a broader change in the corporate world, where innovation became more valued than efficiency, and technical precision was no longer a differentiator. Silicon Valley’s culture of “move fast and break things” meant business leaders were less concerned with reliability and more focused on game-changing discoveries. An obsession with efficiency,  researchers have discovered (pdf), can come at the expense of invention.</p><p> 六西格玛的下降也是企业界更广泛变化的症状，创新变得比效率更高，而技术精度不再是差异化因素。 Silicon Valley的“移动快速和破碎事物”的文化意味着商业领袖不太关注可靠性，更专注于更改游戏的发现。研究人员发现了效率的痴迷（PDF），可以以牺牲发明为代价。</p><p> “When I get up on an airplane, I’m very glad it went through a Six Sigma process—there’s a certain comfort in that,” says Mike Pino, a technology strategist at PwC who spent three years at GE. But at organizations built around Six Sigma, he says, “disruptive innovation is discouraged.”</p><p> “当我站起来时，我很高兴经历了六西格玛的过程 - 这是一项舒适的舒适性，”普华永道普华永道三年来的技术策略师Mike Pino说。但他说，在大约六西格玛建造的组织中，“破坏性创新不鼓励。”</p><p>  Six Sigma was born out of the theories of a small group of mid-century engineers who became apostles of quality control. Chief among them was W. Edwards Deming, an American statistician who traveled to Japan to teach manufacturing techniques in 1950. Japan, in desperate need to reinvent its industry in the aftermath of World War II, was eager to learn, and the companies that adopted his techniques of statistical process control saw enormous gains. Deming became a hero to Japanese industry and the  Deming Prize is still awarded by the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers to companies that master his methods.</p><p>  六西格玛诞生于一小群中世纪工程师的理论，成为质量控制的使徒。他们中间的首席是W. Edwards Deming，这是一位向日本前往日本教导制造技术的美国统计名人，以便日本，在第二次世界大战后期的追究过程中，迫切需要重新发明其行业，渴望学习，以及所采用的公司他的统计过程控制技术掌握了巨大的收益。 Deming成为日本工业的英雄，日本科学家和工程师联盟仍然授予掌握他的方法的公司。</p><p> The key to Deming’s techniques was the close observation of manufacturing processes and the meticulous recording of data. Only by closely studying outputs could managers understand if defects were the product of random chance, or flaws in manufacturing equipment or raw materials. The process was applied continually to narrow the variability in finished products.</p><p> Deming技术的关键是对制造过程的密切观察和数据的细致记录。只有通过密切学习产出，管理者可以了解缺陷是否是随机机会的产品，或制造设备或原材料的缺陷。不断施加该过程以缩小成品的可变性。 </p><p> Deming believed quality control was an organization-wide imperative, and insisted on involving CEOs when he worked with companies. He pushed corporations to break down barriers of communication between workers and managers, and to eliminate production quotas and targets that could compromise the process.</p><p>德明人认为质量控制是一个组织广泛的必要性，并坚持在与公司合作时涉及CEO。他推动公司打破工人和经理之间的沟通障碍，并消除可能损害该过程的生产配额和目标。</p><p> By the 1970s, Japanese automobiles and electronics surpassed US products in quality and reputation, and American manufacturers took note. (In 1980, NBC aired a documentary on Japanese management techniques titled, “ If Japan Can, Why Can’t We?”) Deming became a sought-after consultant by companies like General Motors and Ford.</p><p> 到了20世纪70年代，日本汽车和电子产品超越了美国产品质量和声誉，美国制造商采取了注意事项。 （1980年，NBC播出了一篇关于标题的日本管理技术纪录片，“如果日本可以，为什么我们呢？”）Deming是通用汽车和福特等公司的顾问。</p><p> Deming’s methods became systematized into Six Sigma at Motorola, a consumer electronics company battered by Japanese competition. Bill Smith, an engineer, developed and named it in 1985, and CEO Bob Galvin made it a company-wide initiative.</p><p> Deming的方法在摩托罗拉融为六西格玛，是日本竞争遭受殴打的消费电子公司。 Bill Smith，1985年的工程师，开发并命名为它，首席执行官Bob Galvin使其成为一家公司的倡议。</p><p>   In June 1995, while recuperating from heart surgery, Welch invited Larry Bossidy, then CEO of AlliedSignal, to talk to a meeting of GE’s senior executives. Bossidy was a Six Sigma convert and Welch was eager to introduce it to GE’s senior managers.</p><p>   1995年6月，在心脏手术中恢复，Welch邀请Larry Bossidy，然后是联盟的首席执行官，与GE的高级管理人员交谈。 Bossidy是六西格玛转换，韦尔奇渴望将它介绍给GE的高级管理人员。</p><p> Welch was previously on the fence about Deming’s methods, but a survey of GE employees revealed concerns about quality. After a presentation by Bossidy received an enthusiastic response among GE managers, Welch was ready to take the plunge. A cost-benefit analysis showed that improving GE from three or four sigma to six would save the group between $7 billion and $10 billion annually, or the equivalent of 10 to 15% of annual revenue.</p><p> 韦尔奇以前在围栏上关于德明的方法，但对GE员工的调查显示了对质量的担忧。在Bysidy演讲后，在GE管理者中获得了热烈的反应，Welch准备好了。成本效益分析表明，从三个或四个西格玛改善GE为六个，每年将省70亿美元至10亿美元，或相当于年收入的10％至15％。</p><p>  “Once everything came together, I went nuts about Six Sigma,” Welch wrote in his 2001 autobiography  Jack: Straight from the Gut. “With that opportunity [for savings], it wasn’t rocket science for us to take a big swing.”</p><p>  “一切都走到了一起，我疯了大约六西格玛，”韦尔奇在2001年的自传杰克写道：直接从肠道。 “有了这个机会[储蓄]，它不是火箭科学，让我们迈出大摇摆。”</p><p> Welch admitted that much of the statistical underpinning of the system went over his head, but he hired the Motorola manager who ran that company’s Six Sigma Academy to make it work at GE. To drive home its importance, Welch determined that 40% of employees’ bonuses would be tied to Six Sigma, and that stock options would be reserved only for managers in black belt training.</p><p> 韦尔奇承认，该系统的大部分统计资金都越过了他的头，但他聘请了摩托罗拉经理，他们担任该公司的六个西格玛学院，以使其在GE工作。为了开车重点，韦尔奇确定了40％的员工奖金将被束缚在六西格玛，并且股票期权将仅为黑带培训的经理保留。 </p><p> In Welch’s telling, fealty to the doctrine of Six Sigma became paramount. No one could be promoted to management without at least green belt training, and candidates could be rejected if their faith wavered. When one internal applicant to run GE’s nuclear power services division seemed less than devoted, he had to fly from San Jose, California, to company headquarters in Connecticut “to talk to us about his Six Sigma qualifications,” Welch wrote. Eventually, the manager “convinced us that he was deeply committed to Six Sigma” and got the job.</p><p>在Welch的讲述中，忠于六西格玛的学说变得至高无上。如果他们的信仰挥动，没有至少有绿皮带训练，没有人可以在没有绿色皮带训练的情况下促进管理层。当一个内部申请人运营GE的核电服务部门似乎不那么忠诚时，他不得不从加利福尼亚州圣何塞飞往康涅狄格州的公司总部“与我们谈论他的六西格玛资格，”韦尔奇写道。最终，经理“确信我们深深地致力于六西格玛”并得到了这项工作。</p><p> By 2001, GE boasted that some 80,000 employees  had received Six Sigma training (pdf), and completed 500,000 Six Sigma projects since the system was adopted.</p><p> 到2001年，GE吹嘘说，大约80,000名员工已收到六西格玛培训（PDF），自系统采用以来完成了500,000六西格玛项目。</p><p> It seemed to produce results. In the five years to 2001, GE’s annual profit increased by 66%, to $13.6 billion. The spotlight turned to Welch, and the countless profiles and articles that trumpeted his management savvy inevitably discussed the central role of Six Sigma.</p><p> 它似乎产生了结果。在五年到2001年，电气的年利润增加了66％，达到136亿美元。聚光灯转向韦尔奇，而且无数的简介和文章，他的管理层稳定不可避免地讨论了六西格玛的核心作用。</p><p>  While not appreciated at the time, Welch’s retirement from GE in 2001 marked both the high point of the company’s position atop American enterprise and of Six Sigma’s status as a preeminent management credential.</p><p>  虽然当时并非赞赏，但威尔奇于2001年从GE退休，标志着公司在美国企业的职位和六西格玛作为卓越管理资质的地位的高点。</p><p> Welch’s successor, Jeff Immelt, continued to preach the gospel of Six Sigma, but without the same missionary zeal of its early days. Managers began to complain about employees lost to Six Sigma training, particularly for functions like sales, where there was little obvious benefit, according to one longtime GE manager who asked to remain anonymous. A growing number of Six Sigma projects launched by employees, essential for securing the all-important green belt, were no longer fixing major flaws in the company but instead focused on marginal, or even trivial, improvements.</p><p> Welch的继任者，杰夫·艾美州继续讲道六西格玛的福音，但没有相同的传教士热情的早期。经理开始抱怨六西格玛培训的员工，特别是对于销售等功能，根据要求保持匿名的一位长期GE经理，这几乎没有明显的益处。员工推出的六个六西格玛项目，对于确保全部重要的绿皮带至关重要，不再在公司中修复主要缺陷，而是专注于边际，甚至微不足道的改进。</p><p> Perhaps nothing represented the decline of Six Sigma as much as a  2009 episode of  30 Rock—a satirical show running on NBC, then owned by GE as it happens—when Jack Donaghy, the head of NBC programming played by Alec Baldwin, travels to a GE corporate retreat. There, he meets the Six Sigmas, six men, each of whom “embodies a pillar of the Six Sigma business philosophy: teamwork, insight, brutality, male enhancement, hand-shakefulness, and play-hard.” Further mockery of business jargon and corporate training exercises ensues.</p><p> 也许没有什么是六西格玛的衰落，就像在NBC上运行的30次岩石的讽刺秀一样，随后由GE拥有，因为它发生在杰克唐尼西，由Alec Baldwin播放的NBC编程负责人来旅行GE公司撤退。在那里，他遇到了六个Sigmas，六个人，每个人“体现了六西格玛经营理念的支柱：团队合作，洞察力，野蛮，男性增强，手摇困境和斗争。”随后，进一步的商业行话和企业培训练习的嘲弄。</p><p> While GE hummed along for years under Immelt, its earnings were propped up by its financial services business, which under Welch had become  the company’s single-largest segment. That over-reliance proved ruinous during the financial crisis of 2008, almost crippling the company.</p><p> 虽然GE嗡嗡声沿着置身体的多年来，其盈利由其金融服务业务支撑，韦尔奇下面已成为该公司的单一最大的细分市场。在2008年的金融危机期间，这种过度依赖犯了毁灭性，几乎瘫痪了公司。 </p><p> After the financial crisis, Wall Street’s frustrations with GE’s complex organizational structure boiled over and Immelt responded by launching a new program dubbed, simply, “Simplification.” At a corporate level, it meant streamlining the business around a few core industries. For managers, it meant eliminating systems and processes that served no obvious function. For many units, that meant jettisoning Six Sigma.</p><p>金融危机之后，华尔街对GE的复杂组织结构的挫折煮沸并举办了通过推出被称为“简化”的新计划来回应。在公司一级，它意味着简化了一些核心行业的业务。对于管理人员，它意味着消除没有明显函数的系统和流程。对于许多单位，这意味着六西格玛。</p><p> In a  2014 blog post, Immelt tried to summon the old Six Sigma fervor around a new religion, declaring: “we are transforming our culture around what we call Simplification. This is not just management speak, it’s a crusade.”</p><p> 在2014年的博客文章中，Immelt试图召集六西格玛的热情围绕着一种新的宗教，宣称：“我们正在改变我们的文化，我们呼吁简化。这不仅仅是管理说话，这是十字军事。“</p><p> More management speak followed. In a 2016 conference call with analysts and investors, Immelt touted “additive manufacturing” technology—a process similar to 3D printing—as the latest fix for GE’s woes, and he revealed more than perhaps he intended about his thoughts on Six Sigma.</p><p> 遵循更多的管理人士。在2016年与分析师和投资者的电话会议上，煽动吹捧“添加剂制造”技术 - 类似于3D打印的过程 - 作为GE的困境的最新修复，他透露于他对六西格玛的思想。</p><p> “If you put yourself in my shoes, additive manufacturing makes a shit-load more sense than Six Sigma did,” he said. “I was there the first day we did Six Sigma, it made no sense to me.”</p><p> “如果你把自己放在鞋子里，添加剂制造就会比六西格玛更有意义，”他说。“ “我在第一天我们做了六西格玛，对我来说没什么意义。”</p><p> In the end, no management system could cure what ailed GE. Immelt borrowed to make big bets, such as spending $10.6 billion to buy the power division of France’s Alstom. Those moves backfired, and as debt mounted and earnings dwindled,  restless shareholders forced out Immelt in August of 2017. A year later, his successor, John Flannery,  was also out.</p><p> 最后，没有管理系统可以治愈什么友好的GE。 Immelt借入的押注，例如花费106亿美元购买法国阿尔斯通的权力部门。那些举动的举动，作为债务所登录的债务和盈利，令人不安的股东于2017年8月被迫灭亡。一年后，他的继任者约翰·弗兰尼也在外面。</p><p> Ultimately, GE’s problems were not due to the problems of quality Six Sigma was intended to solve, but with a failure to innovate in a global economy increasingly dominated by technology companies. Six Sigma could get the company  only so far, according to Jim Clifton, CEO of Gallup, the polling and consulting company. “Jack Welch was the king of process innovation,” said Clifton. “But when Jeff Immelt took over, he had a problem—there was nothing left for him to Six Sigma.”</p><p> 最终，GE的问题并非由于质量问题六西格玛旨在解决，但由于技术公司越来越多地统治的全球经济上未能创新。据Galup，Polling and Consulting Company的首席执行官Jim Clifton的说法，六西格玛只能获得公司。 “杰克韦尔奇是流程创新之王，”克利夫顿说。 “但是当杰夫·艾尔接着结束时，他有一个问题 - 他没有任何东西给他六西格玛。”</p><p>  While GE’s management was hitting the limits of Six Sigma inside the company, outside it the system was spreading far and wide. It quickly became unmoored from its manufacturing origins, and was sold as an instant fix for companies and careers mired in mediocrity.</p><p>  虽然GE的管理层正在击中公司内部六西格玛的极限，但在其外面的系统中散布着远方和宽阔。它迅速从其制造起源中不受欢迎，并且被销售为在平庸的公司和职业的瞬间修复。 </p><p> While reputable schools and institutes offered rigorous Six Sigma training, it fell into the hands of hucksters and snake-oil salesman who peddled Six Sigma to would-be business moguls, like Jack’s magic beans.</p><p>虽然信誉良好的学校和机构提供严谨的六西格玛训练，但它落入了匆匆忙忙的蹒跚学步和蛇油推销员手中，他们将六西格玛兜售给威廉般的商业巨头，就像杰克的神奇豆子一样。</p><p> There was an explosion of management books featuring Six Sigma, offering everything from study guides to tailored applications for healthcare and accounting to the inevitable  Six Sigma for Dummies. There were  coffee mugs.</p><p> 有六西格玛的管理书出现了爆炸性，提供了从学习指南到为医疗保健的应用程序量身定制的一切，并考虑到虚拟化的不可避免的六西格玛。有咖啡杯。</p><p>  Six Sigma became “ritualistic and cultish” because its practitioners focused on its nomenclature and methods without understanding the theories undergirding them, according to Steven Spear, a lecturer in organization at MIT’s Sloan School of Management.</p><p>  六西格玛成为“仪式和崇拜”，因为它的从业者侧重于其命名和方法，而不了解麻省理工学院管理层斯洛南管理学院组织的讲师史蒂文矛的理论。</p><p> “You take the tools that help you manage uncertainty and you get rid of the underlying thinking, and you’re left with just the tools,” he says. “That’s how you get to be ritualistic.”</p><p> “你拿走了帮助你管理不确定性的工具，你摆脱了潜在的思维，你只是留下了工具，”他说。 “这就是你成为仪式的方式。”</p><p> It didn’t help that Six Sigma has no owner, accreditor, or even a commonly agreed upon body of knowledge.</p><p> 它没有帮助，六西格玛没有所有者，认证者，甚至是常识的知识体系。</p><p> The fluid nature of Six Sigma, and its potential for almost unlimited abuse, was explained by Mikel Harry, a former Motorola executive and colleague of Bill Smith’s who became a Six Sigma evangelist and founder of the Six Sigma Management Institute.</p><p> Mickel Harry是迈克尔·哈里（Bill Smith）的六西格玛管理学院的六西格玛福音师和创始人，迈克尔·哈里·哈利·哈利·哈利和同事解释了六西格玛的流体性质，及其几乎无限的滥用。</p><p> Six Sigma could be pretty much whatever you wanted it to be, Harry, who  died in 2017, explained in an interview with  Quality Digest magazine. “Six Sigma is not an absolute; it’s a vision,” he said.</p><p> 在2017年去世的哈利，六西格玛可能是几乎是你想要的，在2017年去世的哈利，在接受质量消化杂志采访时解释说明。 “六西格玛不是绝对的;这是一个愿景，“他说。 </p><p> In its first iteration, at Motorola, Six Sigma was about defect reduction, he said. Its second act, at GE, was about cost reduction. “Six Sigma Generation III” was a system of value creation applicable to anyone, Harry explained. He gave an example of a house painter with four employees who wants to adopt Six Sigma:</p><p>他说，在摩托罗拉的第一次迭代中，他说，六西格玛涉及减少缺陷。它在GE的第二次行动是减少成本。哈利解释说，“六世秒生成III”是适用于任何人的价值创造体系。他给了一个有四名员工的房子画家的例子，他们想要采用六西格玛：</p><p> He reads about Six Sigma and asks, “How can I go do it?” He’s not going to do reproducibility studies, and (statistical analysis). He needs a simpler and more fundamental form of Six Sigma. … And so that person believes he’s practicing Six Sigma. Well, he is. It’s a matter of degree.</p><p> 他读了大约六西格玛并问道，“我怎么能去做呢？”他不会做重复性研究和（统计分析）。他需要一种更简单，更基本的六西格玛形式。 ......所以那个人认为他正在练习六西格玛。好吧，他是。这是一个学位问题。</p><p> The American Society of Quality, or ASQ, a non-profit membership organization founded in 1946, is perhaps the biggest provider of Six Sigma certification, but it is far from the only one. Once limited to green and black belts,  white, yellow, brown belts, and “master black belts.” are offered by a bevy of organizations. The rise in popularity of  Lean, a parallel system of Japanese-inspired process improvement that focuses on reducing waste, has led to a blending of the two, and an even greater proliferation of courses and certifications.</p><p> 美国的质量学会或ASQ是1946年成立的非营利性会员组织，也许是六西格玛认证的最大提供商，但它远非唯一的提供者。曾经限于绿色和黑带，白色，黄色，棕色皮带和“大师黑带”。由一个组织提供的。精益普及的升高，一个专注于减少浪费的日本灵感过程改进的平行系统，导致了两者的混合，以及课程和认证的更大增殖。</p><p> Pity the Six Sigma novice sifting through offerings that range from ASQ’s 134-hour, $12,649  Lean Six Sigma black belt classroom course to an online green belt course available for  $69 (with a Groupon coupon) from the Management and Strategy Institute.</p><p> 怜悯六西格玛新手筛选的是从ASQ的134小时，12,649美元的瘦六西格玛黑带课堂课程到69美元（带Groupon优惠券）的在线绿色皮带课程。</p><p>  “Six Sigma is like the wild, wild west,” says Marv Meisner, who teaches non-credit Six Sigma certificate courses through Villanova University. “Anyone can do training, anyone can offer accreditation.”</p><p>  “六西格玛就像是野生的西方，”马夫梅斯纳说，他们通过Villanova大学教授非信贷六西格玛证书课程。 “任何人都可以做培训，任何人都可以提供认证。”</p><p> Meisner says his program is rigorous and, at $4,300 for a 160-hour black belt course, it’s not cheap. He said one of his challenges is explaining to prospective students why his product is superior to the budget offerings. And despite the competition and decline in broader interest in Six Sigma, he’s as busy as ever.</p><p> Meisner表示，他的计划严谨，为160小时黑带课程的4,300美元，它不便宜。他说，他的一个挑战是向潜在学生解释为什么他的产品优于预算产品。尽管六西格玛的竞争和较广泛的兴趣，但他就像以前一样忙碌。</p><p> “Our business here at the university has never fallen off,” he says. “We have 5,000-6,000 students a year, every single year.”</p><p> “我们在大学的业务从未堕落过，”他说。 “我们每年有5,000-6,000名学生，每一年。” </p><p> The continued demand for Six Sigma training speaks to the enduring value of Deming’s principles. When used in the proper context, it works, and for manufacturing engineers, it still holds value. But it is best thought of as skill, not an all-encompassing management philosophy. Spear of MIT compares it to vocational training, like that given to electricians and plumbers.</p><p>对六西格玛培训的持续需求与审计原则的持久价值发言。当在适当的上下文中使用时，它有效，以及制造工程师，它仍然保持有价值。但它是最好的思考，不是一个全体​​涵盖的管理理念。麻省麻省理工学院将其与职业培训进行比较，就像给电工和水管工一样。</p><p>  GE discontinued Six Sigma as a company-wide initiative more than a decade ago, but it’s not extinct at its factories and offices around the world. It’s still implemented at various businesses to solve specific problems, said Linda Boff, GE’s chief learning officer, in an email. “Six Sigma is still an important tool in the GE toolbox.”</p><p>  GE在十多年前将六西格玛停产，但它并未在世界各地的工厂和办公室灭绝。在电子邮件中，Linda Boff表示，它仍在各种企业实施以解决特定问题。 “六西格玛仍然是GE工具箱中的一个重要工具。”</p><p> At GE Aviation, for example, a green belt is still a minimum requirement and the unit is offering refresher courses to employees who haven’t received Six Sigma training in the past three years. But GE is no longer monotheistic, and will embrace whatever system works best, she said.</p><p> 例如，在GE航空中，绿皮带仍然是最低要求，该单位为过去三年没有收到六西格玛培训的员工提供复述课程。但是，我说，GE不再是一门一代主义，并将接受任何系统效果最佳。</p><p> Elsewhere, interest in Six Sigma has waned in part because it was successful: American manufacturing has reduced its defects, and quality is no longer a top-level concern. “In core manufacturing, you can say we’ve wrung out if it what we can wrung out of it,” says Rob Toole, a partner at Kona HR Consulting. “Now, software drives the process.”</p><p> 在其他地方，六西格玛的兴趣部分是由于它成功的：美国制造业减少了其缺陷，质量不再是最高级别的关注。 “在核心制造中，你可以说我们可以拧出我们可以拧下它，”Kona HR Consulting的合伙人Rob Toole说。 “现在，软件驱动过程。”</p><p> As a consequence, Six Sigma credentials are no longer held in the same regard. “When you see Six Sigma on a resume, it’s like, ‘that’s nice,&#39;” Toole says with a shrug.</p><p> 因此，六西格玛凭证不再在相同的方面。 “当你在简历上看到六西格玛时，就像'那太好了，＆＃39;”托利耸了耸肩。</p><p> Systems like Six Sigma appeal to managers because they are rooted in the pursuit of predictability, and all managers crave predictability, says PwC’s Pino. Knowing a business had been Six Sigma’d was a comfort to business leaders, because it means they have one less thing to worry about.</p><p> PWC的Pino说，像六西格玛一样诉诸经理，因为它们扎根于追求可预测性，而所有经理渴望可预测性。了解一家商业已有六西格玛对商业领袖是一个舒适的舒适性，因为它意味着他们少担心。</p><p> But simply following the steps of a process is no longer a guarantee of success, if it ever was. Business is increasingly complex and interconnected, and it seems unlikely any single system can tame it. The smart enterprise of the future will need a constantly evolving rotation of systems and skills, employed by adaptable and flexible workers. They will be harder to teach in a course, but they may outlast all the fads and fashions that preceded them.</p><p> 但是，只要遵循一个过程的步骤，就不再是成功的保证，如果有史以来。业务越来越复杂，互联，似乎不太可能任何单一系统都可以驯服它。未来的智能企业将需要通过适应和灵活的工人使用的系统和技能的不断发展的旋转。在课程中，他们将更加努力地教授，但它们可能比在他们之前的所有时尚和时装比较。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://qz.com/work/1635960/whatever-happened-to-six-sigma/">https://qz.com/work/1635960/whatever-happened-to-six-sigma/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/发生/">#发生</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/happened/">#happened</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/六西格玛/">#六西格玛</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
