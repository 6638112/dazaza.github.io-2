My views are entirely my own, based on my recollections and personal experiences during my time with the company.</p><p>注意：我是作为Autodesk的前员工（截至6月2021年6月）的员工。根据我与公司的时间内的回忆和个人经历，我的观点完全是我自己的。</p><p> I’ve been working with the  Shotgun team in various capacities for t  he past 7 years, shortly after it was acquired by  Autodesk. The first few months I worked with the team, people would ask me what it was like, and I’d always answer “absolutely everyone is super-smart, it’s really weird”. Practically everyone who was there back then has now moved onto other things outside of Autodesk, but I stay in touch with many of them and miss working with them all greatly.</p><p> 在Autodesk收购后，我一直在曾经有过7年的各种能力的霰弹枪队伍。我与团队合作的最初几个月，人们会问我是什么样的，我总是回答“绝对每个人都超级聪明，这真的很奇怪”。实际上，那里的每个人都又搬到了Autodesk之外的其他东西，但我与他们中的许多人保持联系，想念他们的大大大。</p><p> Today I read  this post (warning: the language used in the post is quite strong). It’s the kind of thing no Product Manager wants to read, as it signifies us having failed our users. It made me reflect on how things have changed both in the company and how those changes have manifested in the formerly beloved product itself over the past few years.</p><p> 今天我读到了这篇文章（警告：帖子中使用的语言相当强）。这是没有产品经理想要阅读的东西，因为它表示我们失败了我们的用户。它让我体现了公司在公司中的改变以及这些变化如何在过去几年中表现出在原来的最爱的产品本身。</p><p> When I started, the feeling within the Shotgun team was one of a startup embedded within a larger corporation. We had a great deal of autonomy, and I spent the first few months blissfully unaware of what most of the rest of Autodesk was doing. We were focused on one thing, and that singular purpose, combined with the fact that most of the team (myself included) had been plucked out of the industry we were now serving, meant that all of us cared deeply about the work we were doing. Customer pain wasn’t a cliche, it was our pain too. I spent months embedded with people trying to use Shotgun to get their film and episodic shows produced, I was there when things went wrong for them and they lost time or got frustrated. Our company mission was to “get people home in time for dinner” and we all knew how important that was. We had seen people work long hours, sacrificing everything for the sake of a single shot in a piece of media (or had been one of those people). We desperately wanted to succeed.</p><p> 当我开始时，霰弹枪团队内的感觉是嵌入在一个较大的公司内的创业公司之一。我们有很多自主权，我花了最初的几个月，幸福地没有意识到其余的Autodesk的大部分是在做的事情。我们专注于一件事，这种奇异的目的，结合了大多数球队（我所包括的）被拔出的行业所在的事实，意味着我们所有人都深深地关心我们正在做的工作。顾客疼痛不是一个陈词滥调，这也是我们的痛苦。我花了几个月嵌入着试图用霰弹枪获得他们的电影和剧目的表演，当时他们出了问题而且他们失去了时间或沮丧的时候，我就在那里。我们公司的使命是“让人们回家于晚餐”，我们都知道这是多么重要。我们看到人们长时间工作，为一段媒体中的一次射击牺牲一切（或者是那些人之一）。我们拼命想要成功。</p><p>  Even when I joined seven years ago, much of the technology used in the web-based product was dated, and many of the design patterns and user interactions were archaic or undercooked in a rush to get them out the door. From a certain perspective, this was a good thing– the product had product-market fit, and arguably a big part of the reason for that was that its development process was optimised for being responsive to the multitude of varying needs of its customers, not in spending time and energy in polishing features that were good enough. One thing I learned about building B2B software, is that every customer needs different things. So if you have customer A who needs something, then you go and build it as quickly as possible, when customer B comes along with a different problem, you are incentivised in the short term to now go and build the thing customer B needs, rather than iterating on the feature you just made for the benefit of some imaginary future customer. Everyone wants to build software that delights, but doing so often means not doing something else, and when you are trying to make people “happy” and “willing to pay”, as opposed to “delighted”, something has to give.</p><p>  即使我加入七年前，也会在基于Web的产品中使用的大部分技术，并且许多设计模式和用户互动是古老的或遭受匆忙的粗糙，以便将它们从门出门。从一定的角度来看，这是一个很好的事情 - 产品具有产品 - 市场的合适，可谓是一个重要的原因，这就是其开发过程得到了优化，因为对其客户的众多不同需求进行了优化，而不是在花时间和能量方面，抛光特征足够好。我了解B2B软件的一件事是每个客户都需要不同的东西。因此，如果您有客户A需要一些东西，那么您可以尽快建立并尽快建立它，当客户B与不同的问题出现时，您在短期内激励到现在，并建立客户B需要的东西，相反而不是迭代你刚才为某些虚构未来客户提供的。每个人都想建立乐趣的软件，但这样做经常意味着不做别的事情，当你试图让人们“快乐”和“愿意付钱”时，而不是“高兴”，有些东西必须给予。</p><p> Years of this mindset had created a product that was feature-rich, had incredible retention, even winning an Academy Award, but was falling apart at the seams from product debt. We had reached a point with the product where whenever we tried to build anything new or otherwise update certain aspects of the software, dozens of unrelated things would break. There was limited test coverage across all the code, and conversely a lot of different ways for users to configure their particular experience. It wasn’t that every instance of Shotgun was unique, but it wasn’t far off.</p><p> 多年来这一心态创造了一个拥有丰富的产品，令人难以置信的保留，甚至赢得了学院奖，但在产品债务的接缝处崩溃了。我们已经达到了产品的观点，每当我们尝试建立一个新的或以其他方式更新软件的某些方面，那么几十个不相关的东西会破坏。所有代码中的测试覆盖率有限，并相反，用户配置了许多不同的方式来配置其特定的体验。并不是那么霰弹枪的每个例子都是独一无二的，但它并不遥远。</p><p> It was a problem that always seemed incomprehensible to new leadership. Someone would join the team with the ambition to make us go faster, assuming it was down to lack of motivation or willingness to make changes. I referred to  this excellent article often when I was thinking about this situation, and this graph in particular:</p><p> 这是一个似乎对新领导似乎难以理解的问题。有人会加入团队的野心让我们更快地走得更快，假设它缺乏缺乏动力或愿意做出改变。我经常在思考这种情况时提到这篇优秀的文章，特别是这个图表： </p><p>  We were constantly in the red area of the graph. We had tons of data on what we needed to do with the product, debated furiously about what was the most important of all the things to commit our scarce resources to, because doing anything at all would be extremely challenging and costly; and then failed to execute effectively. That though, was not down to any technical hurdles. It was down to an existential issue.</p><p>我们经常在图表的红色区域。我们有很多关于我们需要与产品所需的数据，令人争论疯狂地争论我们稀缺资源的所有事情最重要的是什么，因为一切都是非常具有挑战性的和昂贵的事情;然后未能有效地执行。但是，没有到任何技术障碍。这是一个存在的问题。</p><p>  Autodesk is a big corporation, albeit one with less than 10,000 employees globally. It’s best known for AutoCAD, though the overall product portfolio probably numbers in the hundreds. Most of what Autodesk does is serve the architectural, construction and manufacturing industries. A tiny portion of its revenue though, comes from media &amp; entertainment, predominantly high-end 3D content creation and rendering (with Shotgun as the product that focuses on the business functions of those processes). No one seems to know, or at least be able to articulate why it maintains its deathgrip (over time it has acquired many of the dominant products in the space) over a vertical that doesn’t materially factor into the company’s bottom line. We would speculate that there’s the sex appeal (such as it is) of big splashy visual effects showreels in stark contrast to photos of people with hardhats and the umpteenth render of a building exterior in corporate marketing materials. Whatever the reason, we constantly felt that the corporate overlords would at some point decide to cut their losses and drop the entire division. That never happened though. Instead we had a string of reorgs and their corresponding shifts in focus.</p><p>  Autodesk是一家大公司，尽管全球员工少于10,000名员工。它是最着名的AutoCAD，尽管整体产品组合可能数百个。 Autodesk的大部分都是建筑，建筑和制造业的服务。虽然是收入的小部分来自媒体＆amp;娱乐，主要是高端3D内容创建和渲染（带霰弹枪作为专注于这些流程的业务功能的产品）。似乎没有人知道，或者至少能够阐明为什么它保持它的死亡人（随着时间的推移它已经在空间中获得了许多占据空间中的许多优势产品），这些垂直不会将其归因于公司的底线。我们会推测性别呼吁（如它是）大脾脏视觉效果Showreels，与具有安全帽的人的照片和Umpteenth呈现出企业营销材料的建筑物外观的人的照片。无论原因如何，我们不断觉得公司霸主会在某些时候决定削减他们的损失并放弃整个部门。尽管如此。相反，我们有一串reorg及其相应的焦点转变。</p><p> Around three years ago our product group was selected to pilot a new “incubation” process within Autodesk. On paper it was a superb idea- you allow a group to effectively function with the same level of autonomy– and accountability– as a startup would. Our goals became growth-based, we had targets and if those targets were successfully met then our “funding” would increase accordingly.</p><p> 左右三年前，我们的产品组被选中来试点Autodesk中的新“孵化”过程。在纸上它是一个卓越的想法 - 您允许一个小组有效地函数与初始自主权和问责制 - 作为启动。我们的目标成为基于增长的，我们有目标，如果这些目标成功遇到，那么我们的“资金”将相应增加。</p><p> The problem though, was that no-one on the team actually cared about growth. “Get people home in time for dinner” had to become something more like “get even more people home at some time”. Our growth targets then just became a means to an end: get more users and then we get permission to do the stuff that we actually felt excited by.</p><p> 然而，这个问题是球队中的没有人真正关心的增长。 “让人们回家的时间吃晚餐”必须变得更像是“在某个时间里的更多人回家”。我们的增长目标然后成为一个目的的手段：让更多的用户，然后我们获得许可，以做我们实际感到兴奋的东西。</p><p> With all of this came a sense of (in retrospect) unjustified optimism. The team was restructured, some development teams were dropped and more senior managers were hired in their place. The idea was to get them in place for when our team would be able to grow. The only thing we needed to figure out was where to find the growth opportunity.</p><p> 随着所有这一切都是一种（回想起来）不合理的乐观情绪。该团队被重组，一些开发团队被删除，更多的高级经理人在他们的位置。这个想法是让他们到位，因为我们的团队能够成长。我们唯一需要弄清楚的是找到增长机会的地方。</p><p> The high-end visual effects industry that we dominated is notoriously slow to adapt to change, and operates for the most part on razor-thin margins. There were billions flowing into film and episodic production every year, but there wasn’t (and likely still isn’t) an obvious opportunity to further monetise our existing customers. But there were two bets that might make a difference. First, Shotgun was too hard to get up and running for anyone unfamiliar with it (due to us never having paid back the aforementioned product debt). Fixing this might lead to greater adoption. Second, although Shotgun popular with Producers and Coordinators, Artists didn’t get on well with it. It was estimated that in a given company there were many more artists not using Shotgun than there were people already using it and that winning them over would lead to significant growth.</p><p> 我们主导的高端视觉效果行业令人惊叹的是适应变化的速度，并且在剃刀薄的边缘最大的工作。每年有数百万流入电影和情节产量，但没有（并且可能仍然没有）是进一步货币我们现有客户的明显机会。但有两个赌注可能会产生差异。首先，霰弹枪太难了，因为没有熟悉的人（由于我们从未偿还上述产品债务），那么竞争和运行。修复这可能会导致更大的采用。其次，虽然霰弹枪热门生产者和协调员，但艺术家并没有与它相处得很好。据估计，在给定的公司中，还有更多的艺术家不使用霰弹枪，而不是已经使用它，并且赢得了它们会导致显着增长。</p><p> We organised around going after those two potential opportunities and then almost immediately ran into trouble. I (along with a couple of other product managers) was involved with solving the ease of use problem. What was easy was identifying the roadblocks and them prioritising their importance. Where we came unstuck was in actually trying to implement viable solutions to those problems. Any single problem we tried to address was going to be a multi-month effort with the team we had and the technical challenges we would have to overcome (and again, in retrospect even those estimates seem woefully optimistic). There was also the problem which no-one really wanted to admit, which was we didn’t have experience of building things that were easy to use (fortunately, for me at least, many of the people we hired over the past couple of years  did have that experience, and I learned a lot from them).</p><p> 我们在经过这两个潜在的机会之后举办的，然后几乎立刻遇到了麻烦。我（以及其他一些产品经理）涉及解决易用问题。什么很容易识别障碍，他们优先考虑他们的重要性。在我们来的地方，在实际上努力为这些问题实施可行的解决方案。我们试图解决的任何问题都是我们所拥有的团队和我们必须克服的技术挑战（再次回顾这些估计似乎令人讨厌地乐观）的多月份努力。也没有人真正想要承认的问题，这是我们没有建立容易使用的东西的经验（幸运的是，至少在过去几年中我们雇用的许多人确实有这种经历，我从他们那里学到了很多）。 </p><p> But we tried, thinking we could tackle smaller line items in shorter time spans and build up a sort of momentum. We budgeted work by the quarter, but the first quarter worth of work stretched out to two quarters, then required further work in addressing regressions, then more regressions. My choice each time was between abandoning the work half-finished and try something else, or else seeing things through to completion. I chose the latter option, because we had a long history of leaving things half-finished, and everyone on the team, and our customers, was pretty tired of it. I still don’t know if it was the right one, but it definitely wasn’t the wrong one.</p><p>但我们尝试过，思考我们可以在较短的时间跨越较短的线条项目并积累一种势头。我们在本季度预算工作，但第一季度的工作延伸到两个季度，然后在解决回归方面进一步工作，然后更加回归。我的选择每次都在放弃半成品中，尝试别的东西，否则通过完成来完成事物。我选择了后一种选择，因为我们历史悠久地离开了半成品，而且团队中的每个人都厌倦了它。我仍然不知道它是否是正确的，但绝对不是错误的。</p><p> Meanwhile, the artist opportunity was pursued by building out a new product from the ground up, using a much more modern technology stack than we were used to. It represented the future, but it also meant that many developers who were experienced with Ruby or C++ had to reskill in a very short space of time. It was hard. The product, Shotgun Create, ultimately launched as a vastly superior (in terms of user experience) alternative to Shotgun’s capabilities for reviewing and approving work. But it was hard to get people to actually use it. For a couple of months or so, everyone across the organisation stopped what they were doing to help out on the adoption push. It was a stressful time for many, and when it was over, had left a deep scar on the team.</p><p> 与此同时，艺术家机会是通过从头开始建立一个新产品，使用比我们习惯的更多现代技术堆栈。它代表了未来，但它也意味着许多与Ruby或C ++经历过的开发人员必须在很短的时间内重新reskill。那个挺难。该产品，霰弹枪创造，最终推出了霰弹枪审查和批准工作的替代方案的广泛（在用户体验方面）。但很难让人们实际使用它。几个月左右，整个组织的每个人都停止了他们正在做的事情，以帮助采用推动。这是许多人的压力时间，当它结束时，在球队上留下了深深的疤痕。</p><p> Two opposing schools of thought were forming. In one camp, the only way forward was to completely redesign and rebuild Shotgun from scratch, using modern engineering and design. In the other, we had to make incremental changes, minimizing disruption to users above all else. Both approaches had their pros and cons, but the team couldn’t be aligned to one or the other. From leadership down, we oscillated back and forth between each. During this stormy time, the strategy to improve adoption through changes in the product was jettisoned in favour of a focus on Go To Market, and a number of key people departed the company, either through frustration or having been terminated.</p><p> 两个反对的思想学校正在形成。在一个营地中，使用现代工程和设计，唯一的前进方式是完全重新设计和重建霰弹枪和重建霰弹枪。另一方面，我们必须使增量变化，最大限度地减少对所有其他用户的干扰。两种方法都有他们的利弊，但球队不能与一个或另一个人对齐。从领导力下来，我们在每个人之间来回振荡。在这次暴风雨的时光期间，通过产品的变化改善采用的战略被抛弃，有利于重点进入市场，并且许多关键人物通过挫折或被终止地离开了公司。</p><p> The result of this was that for the first time the majority of employees on the Shotgun team were not native to the media and entertainment industry. Many of them were willing to learn, and had a strong sense of empathy, but it would take time to build the domain knowledge up. Priorities shifted once more, this time to focus on integrating with the Autodesk corporate machinery. It was a sensible approach, as it would remove things that were bespoke to Shotgun without providing any real benefit, such as billing and sales channels, but it carried a massive opportunity cost, with leadership making it the top priority for us, and requiring a lot of work over a number of months for the team without having anything users would actually care about to show for it. More reorgs happened, as if to drive this point home. The “Street Team”, a support team comprised of extremely smart and knowledgeable former Shotgun experts and workflow specialists, was dissolved, with the general Autodesk support team attempting to fill in. From the perspective of the product team, we pretty much stopped hearing from customers altogether (aside from those we were speaking to directly).</p><p> 因此，这是霰弹枪队的大多数员工第一次不是媒体和娱乐业的原产。其中许多人愿意学习，并具有强烈​​的同情感，但需要花时间建立域名知识。优先事项再次转移，这次专注于与Autodesk Corporate Machinery集成。这是一种明智的方法，因为它会消除被定制的东西被霰弹枪而不提供任何真正的利益，例如计费和销售渠道，但它带来了大量的机会成本，领导力使其成为我们的首要任务，需要一个在没有任何用户的情况下，团队的许多工作都会在没有用户的情况下实际上关注它。更多的reorgs发生了，好像要开车这个点回家。 “街头队”，一个由极其聪明和知识渊博的前霰弹枪专家和工作流专家组成的支持团队，并与一般的Autodesk支持团队试图填写。从产品团队的角度来看，我们几乎停止了听证会客户完全（除了我们直接发言的人除了）。</p><p> The incubation process ended, or perhaps fizzled out. Many customers were complaining that their needs were not being met, but there wasn’t capacity to do anything about it (others had since given up complaining, which was in many ways worse). What we were trying to focus our energies on at that point was creating the infrastructure to create new experiences in a piecemeal way that would be decoupled from the problematic technology stack. Our bet was that being able to build in a new environment would allow for experimentation and iteration at a speed expected of a modern software company. It represented our attempt to finally break free of the technical debt that had plagued us for years. It was exciting.</p><p> 孵化过程结束，或者可能会逃脱。许多客户抱怨他们的需求没有得到满足，但没有能力对此有所能力（其他人因为抱怨而抱怨，这在许多方面越来越糟糕）。我们试图将能源集中在那一点上的是创造基础设施，以零碎的方式创造新的体验，这是从有问题的技术堆栈解耦的零碎方式。我们的赌注是，能够在新的环境中建立，允许以现代软件公司的预期速度进行实验和迭代。它代表我们终于终于没有多年困扰着我们的技术债务。这是令人兴奋的。</p><p>  I can’t say (both for legal reasons, and because I don’t know) where things are headed for Shotgun going forwards. It has recently been renamed to “ShotGrid” in an effort to make it less problematic, as part of the integration work (and needless to say, requiring a lot of work in its own right). I can count the number of people still working on the ShotGrid team who have industry experience on one hand (and the former willingness to learn and empathise seems to have dissipated), a far cry from how it was when I joined. Perhaps that doesn’t matter. Perhaps the remaining ShotGrid team will be able to address the product debt issues and modernise or otherwise improve it for the userbase in a way we were unable to do. More than anything, I hope to read a post from a customer at some point in the future, telling a story about how the product helped them get home in time for dinner.</p><p>  我不能说（因为法律原因，而且因为我不知道）在哪里出于霰弹枪前进的地方。它最近被重命名为“霰弹枪”，以使其更加有问题，作为整合工作的一部分（无用说，需要在自己的权利中进行大量工作）。我可以计算仍然在一方面有行业经历的霰弹枪队的人数（以及前者学习和同情似乎已经消散的愿意），从我加入的时候哭泣。也许没关系。也许剩下的霰弹枪团队将能够以我们无法做到的方式解决产品债务问题和现代化或以其他方式改善userBase。不仅仅是任何东西，我希望在未来的某个观点中阅读一篇文章，讲述了产品如何帮助他们及时回家的故事。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://thejackjam.medium.com/so-long-autodesk-shotgun-32fb3da74f55">https://thejackjam.medium.com/so-long-autodesk-shotgun-32fb3da74f55</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/autodesk/">#autodesk</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/霰弹枪/">#霰弹枪</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
