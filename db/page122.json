You are paying that margin.\n  You can insure anything these days. From satellite launches to the screen on your smartphone. But not all insurances are created equal. When does it make sense to get insurance, and when will it only cost you extra money? This post describes what insurance is, and it might change your mind on whether you need it or not.\n   An arrangement by which a company or the state undertakes to provide a guarantee of compensation for specified loss, damage, illness, or death in return for payment of a specified premium.\n The definition is a complex way of saying that you\u2019ll pay someone a small amount of money, and they promise to pay you much more if an improbable event happens. It\u2019s the same as a bet, but you don\u2019t want to win.\n Betting and insurance have one thing in common. You pay more than what\u2019s your chance to win. The betting/insurance company needs money to pay salaries, bills, and shareholders.\n  Let\u2019s say that the chance your house burning down this year is 1 in 10,000 and that your house costs $100,000. That means that you should pay a $10 fee (called the premium) to insure your house against burning down.\n  When 10,000 people insure their house, the insurance company collects $100,000 in fees. However, if the chance is correctly estimated, one of the houses is bound to burn down, and the insurance company will have to pay $100,000 to that one client. The insurance company won\u2019t have any money to pay the bills and will go bankrupt.\n A profitable model is to ask for a $20 premium. That way, when the company pays the poor house owner $100,000, it will still have $100,000 left in the bank. From this extra money, they can pay bills and the agent who sold you the insurance.\n Now we have a semi-realistic scenario. You paid $20 - twice as much as what is the chance. The key morale of the story is:\n Insurance companies (same as betting companies) always need to bill you more than the chance you get your big payoff.\n   Assuming you are not a betting man, or you are smart and bet only a small portion of your income as a fun activity, why would you pay for insurance (now that you know it\u2019s almost the same as betting)?\n   Assume you\u2019ve got $10,000 saved up for any emergency, and you earn $40,000 a year.\n YES, this sounds like it would set you back. You\u2019d have to take a loan to pay for the damages.\n  One difference between betting and insuring is the excess. Excess is an amount of money that you have to pay first before you get the insurance payment. From the house example, if you set excess to $5,000:\n  The lower the excess, the higher the chance the insurance company needs to deal with you, the higher the premium.\n Following Rule #1, we don\u2019t need to insure broken window or flooded rooms. That\u2019s what our savings are for.\n  You want to involve the insurance company only when the potential event causes you severe financial distress. You shouldn\u2019t involve the insurance company in events that you can easily cover from your savings. If you do, you have to pay much more than what\u2019s the chance of the event. I explained that at the beginning.\n  Lastly, I\u2019ve read advice  1 that you shouldn\u2019t just renew your yearly insurance subscription automatically but should call the insurance company and try to get a better deal each year. This sounds like good advice, but I haven\u2019t tried it yet.\n Insurance is a costly betting that\u2019s only worth it if you can\u2019t afford to pay for the damage yourself. That means it should be reserved for expensive assets and for your health. You will unnecessarily lose money if you insure something that your savings can cover.\n  Of course, you are taking a larger risk by not insuring cheaper items.

Read previous columns   here.\n  Many summers ago, I discovered a book called \u201cA Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates\u201d at a used bookstore I visit. That title being irresistible, I looked inside. It did not disappoint. The main table takes up 400 pages, each with 50 lines of 50 digits. Page after page, in neat columns, it makes parades of digits chosen from 0 to 9, guaranteed to be free of rhyme or reason. Every year since I\u2019ve admired it again, before putting it back on the shelf.\n  The book, I learned, was published by the Rand Corporation in 1955. Rand generated the numbers physically, by spinning a series of wobbly electronic \u201croulette wheels\u201d over and over and recording the results. Their classic book was widely used by engineers and scientists for years in the days before modern computers. (Though errors were recently found, as Michael Phillips  reported last year in The Wall Street Journal.)\n  What does it mean for a series to look random? The simplest property is that each digit appears equally often\u2014the digital die is not loaded. Each run of two digits also appears equally often. This means that each digit conveys no information about the next one. If no method works to use earlier digits to predict the values of later ones, our series has proven completely unpredictable\u2014and it is fair to say that it looks random.\n    Sequences of such randomly generated numbers are useful for many purposes, such as what statisticians call unbiased sampling. To estimate average properties of a big data set, you sample a small subset. This is legitimate, provided that you choose the sample without any bias. A table of random numbers can help you do that.\n    In the age of ginormous data sets and intense computer games, random numbers are more valuable than ever. Many applications call for more than a million random digits, delivered rapidly. Market surveys and shoot-\u2018em-up games are both voracious consumers.\n  Nowadays, when a computer needs random numbers, the usual method is to generate them on the fly. More precisely, it starts with a big \u201cseed\u201d number and then does two things, over and over. It puts the big number through a fixed series of mathematical operations that scramble it (akin to thoroughly shuffling a deck of cards). Then it records a few digits of the result as the next entries in its output (like dealing a hand). Then it does the same things again, starting with the processed number. Rinse, lather, repeat. Aside from the seed number and the shuffling procedure, the whole process is self-contained, mechanical and free of any choices.\n    When a deterministic procedure like this gives an output that looks random, we say its output is pseudo-random. The pseudo version of randomness has important advantages in scientific and cryptographic applications, because by sharing the key and program\u2014here, the seed and shuffling mechanism\u2014you can allow others to reproduce your (otherwise) unpredictable choices.\n  Pseudo-randomness is a beautiful metaphor for how our own perception of free choice can emerge from underlying determinism as we navigate through the world. Just as a sequence of pseudo-random numbers appears freely chosen if you don\u2019t have access to the program and seed, so can human actions appear to be freely chosen if you lack access to the brain\u2019s underlying subconscious processing. I suspect that this is more than a metaphor.\n  \u201cA Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates\u201d is now obsolete. But to me it\u2019s cerebral poetry\u2014the ultimate in free verse. This summer I might re-shelve it in the poetry section, or finally buy it, or maybe just put it back, as usual. I\u2019m happy to think the choice is mine\u2014even though (I think) I know better.\n  \u2018Do you believe in free will?

", "note_en": "Business at the adult content and porn site OnlyFans has boomed during the pandemic, making its majority owner a new billionaire \u2013 and raising fresh concerns about his past.\n    In October 2018, Florida-based internet porn baron Leonid Radvinsky, now 39, bought an estimated 75% of a growing but largely unheard-of business called OnlyFans. At the time, London-based OnlyFans was a fledgling video and social site that allowed adult performers to make money from the comfort of their own homes.\u00a0\u201cContent creators\u201d \u2013 mostly porn stars \u2014 set up accounts via the company\u2019s platform and charge a subscription fee to viewers (whom the company calls \u201cfans\u201d) that ranges from $4.99 to $49.99 a month \u2014and the performers keep 80% of whatever they charge.\n With all film production \u2013 adult or otherwise \u2013 shuttered during the pandemic and millions of lonely people stuck at home, OnlyFans\u2019 business has boomed. In the year through November 2020, OnlyFans posted revenues of $400 million, up 540% over the prior year, 80% of which came from American customers.\u00a0The number of creators nearly quintupled to 1.6 million, including more mainstream stars like Cardi B, DJ Khaled, Fat Joe, and Rebecca Minkoff. The total number of paying fans rose more than 500% to 82 million. Profits after tax rose to $60 million from $6.6 million.  Forbes estimates that Radvinsky\u2019s stake in Fenix International \u2013 OnlyFans\u2019 parent company \u2014 makes him a new billionaire, worth some $1.8 billion.\n  Outside of these eye-popping financials, which were published in the U.K., little is known about Radvinsky, who didn\u2019t respond to repeated requests for comment. A representative for OnlyFans also declined to comment.\n We do know that OnlyFans was founded in 2016 by a British entrepreneur named Timothy Stokely, now 37, alongside his retired banker father, Guy Stokely, and brother Thomas. In U.K. filings, Radvinsky and Guy Stokely are listed as the company\u2019s sole directors. Timothy, Thomas, and Guy Stokely all declined to comment for this story.\n   What little else is known about Radvinsky is not flattering. Some twenty years ago, before Internet pornography was widely available for free, he ran a small empire of websites that advertised access to \u201cillegal\u201d and \u201chacked\u201d passwords to porn sites, including ones that were advertised as featuring underage performers. In the late 1990s such link sites were common and were used to market not just pornography but online gambling and other grey market activities.\n But Radvinsky was particularly aggressive. Looking through the Wayback Machine\u2019s website archive,  Forbes uncovered 11 such sites, all created in the late 1990s and early 2000s by Radvinsky and his Glenview, Illinois-based business, Cybertania. They included Password Universe, which, in 2000, published a link directing web users to a site claiming to offer pedophiles more than 10,000 \u201cillegal pre-teen passwords.\u201d In 1999, a site called Working Passes had a link for \u201cthe hottest underaged hardcore\u201d containing 16-year-olds. Also in 2000, another site, Ultra Passwords, promised a link containing \u201cthe best illegal teen passwords\u201d and \u201cthe hottest bestiality site on the web.\u201d The legal age for porn actors in the U.S. is 18, while bestiality (the act of having sex with an animal) is illegal in most American states.\u00a0(The Wayback Machine removed Radvinsky\u2019s old websites from its archive after speaking to  Forbes.)\n  But there\u2019s no evidence that any of Radvinsky\u2019s sites actually linked to child pornography or bestiality. Instead, the sites appear to have been a way for Radvinsky to earn money by charging his partners (actual porn sites) for every click.  Forbes, prohibited from accessing such imagery, asked the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a specialist group engaged in the removal of such content on the web, to look at archived webpages containing links advertising underage pornography.\u00a0According to the IWF, none linked to illegal material.\n  It was a scummy business, but it was a profitable one. One of Radvinsky\u2019s sites was bringing in revenues of $5,000 a day in 2002, or $1.8 million for the year.\n  Instead, the links typically went through to similar sites offering more links to free porn passwords or other adult content. In 2002, a year before Radvinsky graduated from Northwestern University, where he majored in economics, his company Cybertania sued domain name registrar and internet backbone provider Verisign, claiming that Verisign transferred one of its websites to someone else. In that suit, Radvinsky\u2019s company said that it was in partnership with those same sites from which it had claimed to have \u201chacked\u201d logins: \u201cCybertania earned a sum of money for each hyperlink connection or password, used from the respective owner and operators of those referral sites,\u201d Cybertania\u2019s lawyers wrote. In another lawsuit against Radvinsky, the plaintiff stated that Ultra Passwords \u201cpresents the deceptive image of providing \u2018hacked\u2019 (stolen) passwords to get free services from other pornographic sites, but which is in fact a lucrative affiliate referral site.\u201d\n  It was a scummy business, but it was a profitable one. In the Cybertania suit against Verisign, Radvinsky\u2019s company said its Ultra Passwords site was bringing in revenues of $5,000 a day in 2002, or $1.8 million for the year.\n Radvinsky remained elusive during the nearly 20 years between the start of his sex link farm businesses and his purchase of 75% of OnlyFans. In the early 2000s, he created a handful of sites linking to celebrity sex tapes and MyFreeCams, a site that claims to be the world\u2019s number one porn-via-webcam service. He has also occasionally popped up in lawsuits. In 2003 and 2004, Amazon and Microsoft sued Radvinsky in U.S. district court in Seattle for alleged spam campaigns that used the Amazon name and Microsoft email tools to offer spam recipients \u201cfree money from the government\u201d or links to adult websites. Radvinsky denied all allegations. The cases were settled out of court in 2005, and Radvinsky and his businesses were barred from using Amazon\u2019s name in spam or using any of Microsoft\u2019s email tools . His Cybertania business was sued in 2005 by a model, Sheila Lussier, for using her (clothed) image on one of his porn sites, an allegation the company fought. Lussier says she settled for an undisclosed sum.\n OnlyFans has run into its own issues with underage performers. Since the site doesn\u2019t independently verify its sex workers\u2019 ages, it\u2019s fairly easy for people to lie. In late May, a BBC investigation revealed that a 14-year-old girl had been able to register an account as a performer on OnlyFans using her grandmother&#39;s passport. A senior police officer told the BBC that OnlyFans is \u201c[N]ot doing enough to put in place the safeguards that prevent children exploiting the opportunity to generate money, but also for children to be exploited.&#34; In response, OnlyFans issued a statement that it used \u201cstate-of-the-art technology\u201d and \u201chuman monitoring\u201d to try to prevent under-18s sharing content on the platform and it took the issue \u201cvery seriously.\u201d\n Signy Arnason, associate executive director of The Canadian Center for Child Protection, says her group often receives notifications about OnlyFans\u2019 models potentially being underage.

Fortune 500 Senior Software Engineer Mardochee &#34;Mardix&#34; Macxis is launching BlackDevHub.io, the first Black social and job matching network built on blockchain technology.\n BlackDevHub.io offers Black and African American people in tech and hiring organizations who want to hire them a decentralized platform to build community, share job opportunities and create new applications in a free space limited only by its users&#39; ambitions.\n BlackDevHub.io exists to solve a real problem plaguing the tech industry: lack of diversity. Despite historic interest in racial equity and inclusion at all levels of society, Black representation in tech remains low. At leading tech companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter, Black people make up just 3\u20136% of employees. And it&#39;s not for lack of desire \u2014 Black people are interested in tech, and tech companies are interested in hiring them. They just don&#39;t always know how to find each other.\n  &#34;I created BlackDevHub.io to level the playing field and bridge the gap between Black talent and employers. BlackDevHub.io splits the power evenly between Black talent and the companies who want to hire them, providing opportunity-seekers a growth-minded community and hiring managers a secure, streamlined platform to list positions and connect with incredible talent they may have otherwise missed. We can&#39;t wait to see what our users accomplish on BlackDevHub.io.&#34;\n BlackDevHub.io also makes it easier for organizations committed to diversity to showcase their efforts to the world. With its blockchain-verified Diversity Index, BlackDevHub.io ranks Fortune 500 companies for diversity in tech hires.

Their people-first mindset and approach to human capital is refreshing and indicative of the type of venture capital that the new generation of founders like myself really value.\u201d\n nate\u2019s management claims they offer the first  AI-enhanced online shopping tool that \u201ccentralizes purchasing onto a single platform,\u201d allowing clients to acquire a product from any digital commerce store with the \u201cclick of a button.\u201d The firm\u2019s Fintech app serves as a universal shopping solution that comes with an embedded social side, where \u201cfriends can inspire each other.\u201d\n nate says that it touches the consumer journey \u201cfrom inspiration to purchase, and enables the payment.\u201d The Fintech firm recently introduced its own pay later solution, and now plans to\u00a0 expand its line of payment products. Unlike similar products, however, nate claims that it \u201cnever compromises consumer privacy or charges merchants a single cent.\u201d\n  \u201cFor the first time in history, shoppers have a seamless, universal, and private way of buying anything online. Everything we do at nate is driven by cherishing what makes us human, from the people we hire to how we design our products.\u201d\n As mentioned in the update shared with CI, nate\u2019s customer base has been doubling \u201cevery six weeks.\u201d The global digital commerce market size was valued at more than $4 trillion, nearly $1 trillion of which comes from the US.\n As noted in the release, nate users have \u201cthe ability to purchase from all 2.1 million online stores in the US \u2014 representing the long-tail of the non-Amazon economy and 60% of US e-commerce.\u201d\n  \u201cIn another step of growth, nate has also expanded its board of directors.

the national expansion of its virtual behavioral health solution designed specifically to support children, teenagers, and their families.\n   GV (formerly Google Ventures) led\u00a0Brightline\u2019s series B round, with participation from new investors Optum Ventures, 7wireVentures, and Gaingels, the leading venture investment syndicate in support of diversity and representing the LGBTQ community and allies. Debra Lee, chairman and CEO Emeritus, BET Networks, also contributed to the round as an independent investor.\n  Returning investors in the round include Oak HC/FT, Threshold Ventures, Blue Shield of California, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, SemperVirens VC\u00a0and City Light Capital.\n The round includes $7 million of venture debt from Silicon Valley Bank. Brightline has now raised a total of nearly $100 million in funding to date.\n Brightline, formerly Emilio Healthcare, developed a technology-enabled behavioral health home for children and their families. The company&#39;s growth\u00a0comes at a time when rates of behavioral health conditions are skyrocketing across the country and having a disproportionate impact on working families\u2014leading to rampant productivity loss and employees leaving the paid workforce in droves, according to Brightline.\n  Around 10 million American mothers living with their school-age children were not working at the start of 2021, a 1.4 million increase over the previous year, according to data from the Census Bureau.\n Brightline\u2019s own survey of working parents and caregivers found that 50% reported losing significant productivity at work in caring for their children\u2019s behavioral health needs.\n There is a need for family-oriented solutions to deliver behavioral health care services, according to Brightline executives.\n \u201cIn the past year, families everywhere have felt the impact of the pandemic on their children and daily lives. We\u2019re seeing more children, adolescents, and teens than ever with behavioral health challenges\u2014now is the time for us to get ahead of the coming wave of need,\u201d said Naomi Allen, Brightline CEO and co-founder in a statement.\u00a0\u201cWe are fortunate to have incredible partners in GV and all of our investors who joined us to make a difference in the lives of children and families. The latest funding will allow us to innovate even more quickly, expand rapidly, and help more children and families get the care they deserve.\u201d\n Brightline will use the cash infusion to scale its virtual\u00a0care across the country\u2014fueling the company&#39;s\u00a0growth as it\u00a0partner with leading national employers and major health plans to bring behavioral health support to families, according to the company.\n \u201cCDC data shows that an estimated 1 in 5 U.S. children has a diagnosed mental or behavioral health condition\u2014yet 80% will not get the care they need. Pediatric behavioral health care is often less accessible and comprehensive than care for adults,\u201d said Ben Robbins, psychiatrist and venture partner at GV who is joining Brightline\u2019s board of directors. \u201cBrightline addresses the huge unmet need of pediatric behavioral health services and is uniquely positioned to provide multiple levels of care based on the needs of patients and families.\u201d\n Livongo founder Glen Tullman, now CEO of Transcarent and managing partner at 7wireVentures, and Laura Veroneau, partner at Optum Ventures, are joining Brightline as board observers.\n Brightline also announced that they are embarking on their biggest expansion to date, introducing new products with nationwide availability and expanding clinical services to new states.\n Launched in 2019, Brightline&#39;s platform offers multidisciplinary care teams, a family-focused approach and\u00a0evidence-based care delivery, and innovative technology, Brightline is able to support families with whatever challenges they&#39;re facing.\n Telehealth helps to make mental health care easier to access for kids by doing away with some of the logistical burdens\u00a0of getting to and from frequent appointments.\n  There are a few pediatric startups making inroads in the digital health market. Hazel Health operates virtual care clinics inside the school nurse&#39;s\u00a0office\u00a0to connect\u00a0students to a physician via telehealth and recently landed a $33 million funding round.\u00a0Sprout, a tech-enabled autism care and treatment program, launched in July\u00a0on the back of $10 million in seed funding.\n Daybreak Health is another startup\u00a0trying to tackle the gaps in mental health care for kids. The company launched in February 2020 and specializes in providing online counseling services, especially for teens.\n Brighline has launched new products with nationwide availability and is expanding\u00a0clinical services to new states.

What does it mean when the creator of a software package uses their social power - but not their legal power - to try and influence user behavior? Are they violating the spirit of open source? Or simply making requests that acknowledge open source realities?\n  The actual back-and-forth is in the  pull request discussion. The  citadel of internet debate that is Hacker News will give you a sense of the larger community response. Briefly, what happened was:\n The creator of an open source software package asked that the package not be incorporated into a larger project. The creator acknowledged that it was technically legal to incorporate the package, but asked that it not be included anyway.  As the author of the package that is being re-packaged here. I\u2019m against it being repacked into here.While licensing wise I cannot stop you, I do hope you can honor my request.Thank you for considering respecting the author\u2019s wishes.\n  When pushed by the project\u2019s maintainers, the package creator explained that they were worried that including the package in the larger project would result in many support requests from the community.  If users experiencing issues with [the package], they will knock on my door. And I\u2019m not willing to support that or accept that burden.\n  Downstream maintainers pushed for more information or explanation. The creator continued to express disinterest in having the package included and in a conversation about the decision\n  Eventually the creator threatened to relicense the package in a way that would make it legally incompatible with the project\n Online opinion is split on this situation. However, some substantial part of the community has responded with a  version of:\n  What can be learned from this? Is this kind of request really against the spirit of FOSS?\n  It is notable that the creator did not kick off this discussion with the threat of legal action. Instead, the creator simply requested that the package not be included. They then explicitly acknowledged that they did not have the legal power to prevent it.\n This was a request that no one had a legal obligation to respect. And yet, the creator made it because (presumably) they believed that the package maintainers lived in a world that was governed by more than black letter legal rules.\n This strikes me as a totally healthy response on behalf of the creator. They clearly understood the consequences of releasing software under an open source license and the potential consequences of being included in a popular software package. The creator expressed these concerns by way of a social request instead of a legal threat because part of living in society is being able to resolve disputes without going to court.\n We will never know, but it strikes me as entirely plausible that the creator may have been willing to leave it at that - as a request that may or may not be complied with - until the maintainers decided to follow up.\n To be clear, the maintainers\u2019 initial response also strikes me as a reasonable one. They probably wanted to understand the concerns that would motivate someone to make the request. They may have also hoped to be able to address those concerns and/or talk the creator out of the objection.\n Unfortunately, this very human response by the maintainers also happened to push the creator to do exactly what the creator was hoping to avoid by raising the concern - spend time talking to people that they do not know about their package. Eventually, after the discussion continued, the creator decided to threaten to relicense the package in a way that would legally prevent inclusion.\n It is important to recognize that this discussion ran on parallel tracks. One track was based on legal requests (or the lack of legal requests). The other was based on social/cultural requests.\n That social/cultural track has the potential to be just as powerful as the legal one (in fact, it is the basis for  this idea). Its existence illustrates that the reasonable resolution of the dispute did not have to rely on a strict interpretation of legal rights. Society is more than the law! The maintainers could have ignored the request and faced meaningful social/cultural consequences without any sort of legal enforcement. Social norms are real and create real change in the world. Even in open source.\n  On the flip side, the package in question is licensed under an MIT license. That license includes a pretty clear \u201canything that breaks is not my problem\u201d disclaimer (in all caps):\n THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \u201cAS IS\u201d, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n If the legal rules were all that mattered here, the text of the license makes this entire dispute a non-issue. The creator offers the software as-is and disclaims any responsibility for it. Why would anyone come back to them if the software had a bug?\n Of course, the text of the license does not match social expectations. Licensing terms aside, the creator recognizes that there is a social expectation in the open source software community that creators maintain packages - or, at a minimum, that it is acceptable for users to reach out to creators to ask for support and/or flag bugs.\n While the creator seems to have understood that they have no legal obligation to deal with these requests, they also understood that they might have a social/cultural obligation to deal with them. Or, at a minimum, that the tools available to open source software creators make it hard to ignore a flood of requests. No amount of pedantic textual analysis of the license terms changes that.\n  This fits in with a long list of stories about how small pieces of code are used by millions without any sort of support for maintainers of the code. In some ways, this is a success story - a random person can create something that is used by millions! In other ways, it is a tragedy - a random person can create something that will make millions of people angry if it breaks!\n Regardless of how you see this dynamic, it is pretty clear that it can create disincentives for individuals (and small groups) to strive for success in open source software. While companies like  Tidelift are working to help solve this problem, being aware of the problem - and wary of how the problem might impact you - is far from failing to understand the spirit of open source software. In fact, it may be an incredibly clear-eyed understanding of how the spirit of open source software interacts with the reality of open source software. Furthermore, framing concerns about that dynamic as a social objection instead of a legal objection seems deeply within the spirit of open source software.\n As a related community, this type of creator burden is something that the open source hardware community should be aware of and work to address. At the same time, I am not convinced that it is exactly the same type of problem in hardware as it is in software. To the extent that open source hardware includes open source software the problems are essentially identical. However, it is different when applied to the hardware itself.\n That difference rests in the fact that design and distribution of software is collapsed into a single step - just post it to the repo. In hardware those steps are quite distinct. Designing open source hardware is quite separate from distributing actual pieces of hardware. That may make it harder for a single person to be responsible for maintaining a piece that is incorporated into millions of projects without any sort of support. But that\u2019s another blog post for another day. Even if the dynamic is not identical, it is certainly similar enough to think about and try to avoid in open hardware.\n  This post originally appeared on the OSHWA blogToday we are excited to announce that the open hardware journal HardwareX is integrating O...\u2026  Continue reading", "posttime": "2021-06-20 13:58:49", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5f00\u6e90,\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1,govern,\u521b\u9020\u8005", "title": "\u5355\u72ec\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53d7\u884c\u4e3a ", "title_en": "Licenses Alone Do Not Govern Behavior in Open Source", "transed": 1, "url": "https://michaelweinberg.org/blog/2021/06/17/licenses-and-social-norms/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5f00\u6e90", "\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1", "govern", "\u521b\u9020\u8005"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "fc3c31c58253862ab75e5fa9215631c1.jpg", "infoid": 1066994, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8df3\u8f6c\u5230\u5bfc\u822a\u8df3\u8f6c\u4ee5\u641c\u7d22\u80a1\u7968\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u7684\u56de\u5fc6\u662f\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f5c\u5bb6EdwinLef\u00e8vre\u76841923\u5e74\u7f57\u9a6c\u00e0\u8c31\u53f7\u3002\u5b83\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u4e2d\u88ab\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u4eba\u7269\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u80a1\u7968\u4ea4\u6613\u5609\u5408\u6770\u897f\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u7075\u611f\u5230\u90a3\u4e00\u70b9\u3002 [1]\n \u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u4ecd\u5728\u6253\u5370\u4e2d\uff08ISBN 0471770884\uff09\u3002 2009\u5e7412\u6708\uff0cWiley\u5728Holdcover\u4e2d\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ce8\u91ca\u7248\uff0cISBN 0-470-48159-5\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86Lef\u00e8vre\uff06\uff0339;\u5728\u56fe\u4e66\u4e2d\u63d0\u5230\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4eba\u548c\u5730\u533a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u5b83\u8fd8\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u51b2\u57fa\u91d1\u7ecf\u7406Paul Tudor Jones\u7684\u524d\u8a00\u3002 [2]\n    1890-1910\uff1a\u5229\u6c83\u7f57\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u5728\u4e0d\u6d3b\u52a8\u80a1\u4e0a\u7684\u51fa\u4ef7\u80a1\u7968\uff0c\u6760\u6746\u961f\u5728\u94f2\u6597\u5546\u5e97\u6760\u6746\u7387\u4e3a100\u81f31\u7684\u5c55\u793a\u6765\u6613\u4e8e\u8d5a\u94b1\u3002\n 1910-1920\uff1aLivermore\u662f\u7ebd\u7ea6\u8bc1\u5238\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u7684\u80a1\u7968\u4ea4\u6613\u5546\uff0c\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\u4ed6\u4e00\u904d\u53c8\u4e00\u904d\u5730\u7206\u53d1\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u7528\u4e86\u592a\u591a\u7684\u6760\u6746\u3002\n 20\u4e16\u7eaa20\u5e74\u4ee3\uff1a\u5229\u5f17\u96f7\u4ece\u4e8b\u5e02\u573a\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u6536\u8d39\u768425\uff05\u7684\u88ab\u64cd\u7eb5\u80a1\u7968\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u57281934\u5e74\u521b\u5efa\u7f8e\u56fd\u8bc1\u5238\u4ea4\u6613\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u4e4b\u524d\u3002\n  \u57282008\u5e74\u7684\u4e66\u4e2d\uff0c\u9a9a\u52a8\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\uff0c\u827e\u4f26\u683c\u6797\u65af\u6f58\u53eb\u4e66\uff06\uff0334;\u4e00\u4e2a\u6295\u8d44\u667a\u6167\u7684\u5b57\u4f53\u3002\u5e76\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u7684\u62a5\u4ef7\u5982\uff06\uff0334;\u516c\u725b\u548c\u718a\u8d5a\u94b1;\u732a\u88ab\u5c60\u6740\uff06\uff0334;\u73b0\u5728\u662f\u8c1a\u8bed\u3002 [3]\n 2005\u5e743\u6708\u7684\u8d22\u5bcc\u6587\u7ae0\u5728\uff06\uff0334\u4e2d\u5217\u51fa\u4e86\u5b83;\u6211\u4eec\u77e5\u9053\u7684\u6700\u806a\u660e\u7684\u4e66\u7c4d\u548c\uff0334;\u5173\u4e8e\u4e1a\u52a1\u3002 [4] \n\u5728Jack D.

It is told in the first person by a character inspired by the life of  stock trader  Jesse Livermore up to that point.  [1]\n The book remains in print (  ISBN\u00a0 0471770884). In December 2009,  Wiley published an annotated edition in  hardcover,   ISBN\u00a0 0-470-48159-5, that bridges the gap between Lef\u00e8vre&#39;s fictionalized account and the actual people and places referred to in the book. It also includes a foreword by  hedge fund manager  Paul Tudor Jones.  [2]\n    1890-1910: Livermore was able to make easy money by taking advantage of the  bid\u2013ask spread on inactive stocks with leverage of 100-to-1 at  bucket shops.\n 1910-1920: Livermore was a  stock trader on the  New York Stock Exchange, where he went bust over and over again because he used too much leverage.\n 1920s: Livermore engaged in  market manipulation, charging fees of 25% of the market value of the manipulated stock.

At the time,\u00a0KAERI\u00a0initially confirmed and then denied that the attack occurred.\n In a  statement and press conference held yesterday by\u00a0KAERI, the institute has officially confirmed the attack and apologized for attempting to cover up the incident.\n  KAERI states the attack\u00a0took place on June 14th after North Korean threat actors breached their internal network using a VPN vulnerability.\n KAERI\u00a0states that they have updated the undisclosed VPN device to fix the vulnerability. However,\u00a0access logs show that thirteen different unauthorized IP addresses gained access to the internal network through the VPN.\n One of these IP addresses is linked to a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group known as &#39;Kimsuky&#39; that is believed to work under the North Korean Reconnaissance General Bureau intelligence agency.\n  In October 2020, CISA issued an  alert on the\u00a0Kimsuky\u00a0APT group and stated\u00a0that they are &#34;likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence gathering mission.&#34;\n More recently, Malwarebytes has issued a report on how Kimsuky\u00a0(aka Thallium, Black Banshee, and Velvet Chollima) has been actively targeting the South Korean government using the &#39;AppleSeed&#39; backdoor in phishing attacks.\n &#34;One of the lures used by Kimsuky named \u201c\uc678\uad50\ubd80 \uac00\ud310 2021-05-07\u201d in Korean language translates to \u201cMinistry of Foreign Affairs Edition 2021-05-07\u201d which indicates that it has been designed to target the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of South Korea,&#34; explains  Malwarebytes&#39; report on the threat actor&#39;s recent activities.\n &#34;According to our collected data, we have identified that it is one entity of high interest for Kimsuky.&#34;\n Malwarebytes states that Kimsuky\u00a0has targeted other South Korean government agencies in recent phishing attacks, including:\n  KAERI\u00a0states that they are still investigating the attack to confirm what information has been accessed.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 13:22:16", "source_domain":

And the company said it now reaches more than 30 million families worldwide with its mobile apps.\n The company targets its \u201cplaylearning\u201d app at children 2-8 as it tries to expand their vocabulary, improve their literacy skills, and develop important 21st-century skills in a fun, safe environment.\n  Lingokids also invites families to take part in their kids\u2019 playlearning journey through exciting play-together activities. All told, the company\u2019s apps have more than 600 learning activities and songs. The games teach an array of topics and everyday language, as well as 21st-century skills like creativity, communication, collaboration, and critical thinking.\n The apps feature fun, unique characters, developed by Guillermo Garc\u00eda-Cars\u00ed (creator of the famous cartoon  Pocoy\u00f3) and his team. Featuring both original and Oxford University Press content, the Lingokids curriculum has been specially crafted by the company\u2019s educational board with experts in early language learning from companies like LeapFrog, Hasbro, Disney, and Nickelodeon.\n Lingokids has received accolades from programs like PTPA, Mom\u2019s Choice Awards, Product Hackers Awards, enlightED, and Educational App Store. Lingokids was also named one of the Top Startups in 2020 by LinkedIn. The platform is certified by the KidSafe Seal Program and offers a kid-safe environment that is ad-free.\n   Launched in 2016, the San Francisco-based Lingokids has created its \u201cplaylearning\u201d app, and most of its developers are in Madrid, Spain. Lingokids is dedicated to supporting parents in their child\u2019s learning journey, giving them a parents portal featuring each child\u2019s progress with weekly reports, curriculum overviews, activity timeline, as well as advice and tips for parents\u2019 everyday lives through its Parents Community.\n \u201cI was just coming out from an exit, and my sister asked me to help my niece learn English,\u201d Viedma said. \u201cI was something of a gamer with a computer science background. I had always wanted to do games at some point in my life. So I started building some games for my 2-year-old niece.\u201d\n Viedma wanted to get away from passive video experiences. His games worked, and the business snowballed. He formed a company and started making games that he thought were fun. They had real gameplay elements, and then added ecuational elements. They now range from puzzles to endless runner games. The biggest market today is the U.S., where 60% of the families are based. Mexico and Brazil are also large markets.\n The third institutional funding round was led by an undisclosed investor, with participation from GP Bullhound and existing investors HV Capital and Ravensburger, among others. The funding will be used for further international expansion, development of new and engaging forms of content for kids, as well as global hiring, especially for the platform engineering and development teams. Lingokids has raised $65 million to date, reaching positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) in 2020.\n Crist\u00f3bal Viedma, the CEO and founder of Lingokids, said in an interview with GamesBeat that its goal is to help parents and caretakers raise their kids and break down educational barriers. He said the company provides quality education options that parents can trust and these are more important than ever.\n During the pandemic, more than  65% of households with children reported the use of online learning, and 68% of parents said they now rely on early learning apps to supplement their children\u2019s education, according to the U.S. Census. As a trusted resource for educational and interactive content, Lingokids tripled its number of users since the beginning of the pandemic, and is poised to transform the early education market.\n   With this new funding, Lingokids will rapidly increase its international growth. In addition, it will expand its offerings related to science technology engineering and math (STEM), and the learning of skills that many kids missed out on during the past school year like emotional intelligence, empathy, and critical thinking. Lingokids will also develop new audio content in audiobooks and audio-exercises, focusing on topics related to mental health, mindfulness, and meditation.\n \u201cWe\u2019re doing early childhood education for kids ages two to eight years old, teaching them all the basics like language, literacy, reading, writing, mathematics, logic, and programming,\u201d Viedma said. \u201cA billion kids are accessing digital content. But while there are lots of companies in the industry, we are different.\u201d\n The company targets families, with the customer being the parent rather than schools. It creates original content that creates playful interactive experiences for kids. And it reaches those kids through mobile apps.\n \u201cWe are a trusted brand that people learn about when they are looking for kids-safe learning,\u201d Viedma said.\n Lingokids plans to hire an additional 60 people around the world this year, adding to its team of close to 100. The latest additions to Lingokids include Vladimir Klimov as director of content strategy and Tiago Pregueiro, former product director at Cabify, as vice president of product.\n   With its previous investment last year, Lingokids also joined forces with the international toy and puzzles company, Ravensburger. Lingokids and Ravensburger will develop merchandising and new games and toys offline to complement Lingokids\u2019 online activities.\n The company\u2019s partners include Save the Children, UNICEF, UNHCR and American Red Cross.\u00a0The company has been approached multiple times by companies that want to license brands to it or buy it, but Viedma said the company wants to invest in its own learning games and brands.\n \u201cThe long-term vision of the company is building this iconic brand for early childhood education,\u201d he said. \u201cSome experiences are multiplayer, as we think learning can be a social experience.\u201d\n GamesBeat&#39;s creed when covering the game industry is &#34;where passion meets business.&#34; What does this mean?

"Wealth-management software provider Addepar Inc. more than doubled its valuation to $2.17 billion from seven months ago in its latest funding round, the company said Tuesday.\n  Addepar said it had raised $150 million from New York hedge-fund firm D1 Capital Partners. It was previously valued at nearly $1 billion after its last funding round in November, according to a person familiar with the deal.  Earlier investors in Addepar, founded in 2009 by Palantir Technologies Inc. co-founder and serial entrepreneur Joe Lonsdale, include venture firms Valor Equity Partners and WestCap Group.\n  Turbulent markets and a desire by investment advisers to know what could happen to their clients\u2019 portfolios during the pandemic has spurred Addepar\u2019s recent growth, said Chief Executive Eric Poirier. The Mountain View, Calif.-based company makes software for investment advisers, banks and family offices that aims to simplify the tracking of how investment portfolios perform across asset classes. Addepar currently tracks about $2.7 trillion of assets and has added an average $15 billion in assets a week since mid-2020.\n  \u201cThis has been a human trust business since the beginning of time, and having a human who is the financial professional use technology to serve their clients is a sea change,\u201d said Mr. Poirier.\n      He declined to say if the company was profitable or to disclose its revenue but said Addepar was bringing on clients and assets at its fastest pace yet. The company says it thinks the total market demand for investible assets is more than $200 trillion globally. Clients include  AllianceBernstein Holding LP,  Morgan Stanley and  Stifel Financial  , whose investment arm previously invested in Addepar.\n  Mr. Lonsdale, who ran Addepar for its first three years and now is chairman of its board, described it as \u201can operating system for finance.\u201d He said he sees users turning to Addepar because the software aggregates large amounts of information needed to help them make decisions about money.\n  Mr. Lonsdale also said Addepar could have an ecosystem of applications built around its software in several years. In addition to simplified performance reporting, Addepar lets clients view net worth at a glance and last year rolled out a feature called Marketplace that provides information about investment products such as hedge funds, private-equity funds and shares in private companies.\n  Mr. Lonsdale said building out the technology of the firm had taken longer than expected.\n  \u201cIt turns out there are a lot of hard problems to solve in wealth management\u201d such as the distribution of data across thousands of custodians and fund administrators, he said.\n  Addepar plans to use the funding to scale up its sales force globally, particularly in Europe, and continue to invest in research and development. Roughly 90% of its client base is in the U.S. currently, Mr. Poirier said.\n  D1 will take a board observer role.

In a large cluster, if all servers communicate with all the other servers, a lot of network bandwidth can be consumed. Information should reach all the nodes even when some network links are experiencing issues.\n Cluster nodes use gossip style communication to propagate state updates. Each node selects a random node to pass the information it has. This is done at a regular interval, say every 1 second. Each time, a random node is selected to pass on the information.\n   The messages should not consume a lot of network bandwidth. There should be an upper bound of say a few hundred Kbs, making sure that the applications&#39; data transfer is not impacted by too many messages across the cluster.\n The metadata propagation should tolerate network and a few server failures. It should reach all the cluster nodes even if a few network links are down, or a few servers have failed.\n  Each cluster nodes stores the metadata as a list of key value pairs associated with each node in the cluster as following:\n     At startup, each cluster node adds the metadata about itself, which needs to be propagated to other nodes. An example of metadata can be the IP address and port the node listens on, the partitions it&#39;s responsible for, etc. The Gossip instance needs to know about at least one other node to start the gossip communication. The well known cluster node, which is used to initialize the Gossip instance is called as a seed node or an introducer. Any node can act as an introducer.\n  public Gossip(InetAddressAndPort listenAddress, List&lt;InetAddressAndPort&gt; seedNodes, String nodeId) throws IOException { this.listenAddress = listenAddress; //filter this node itself in case its part of the seed nodes this.seedNodes = removeSelfAddress(seedNodes); this.nodeId = new NodeId(nodeId);  addLocalState(GossipKeys.ADDRESS, listenAddress.toString()); this.socketServer = new NIOSocketListener(newGossipRequestConsumer(), listenAddress); } private void addLocalState(String key, String value) { NodeState nodeState = clusterMetadata.get(listenAddress); if (nodeState == null) { nodeState = new NodeState(); clusterMetadata.put(nodeId, nodeState); } nodeState.add(key, new VersionedValue(value, incremenetVersion())); }\n Each cluster node schedules a job to transmit the metadata it has to other nodes at regular intervals.\n  private ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor gossipExecutor = new ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor(1); private long gossipIntervalMs = 1000; private ScheduledFuture&lt;?&gt; taskFuture; public void start() { socketServer.start(); taskFuture = gossipExecutor.scheduleAtFixedRate(()-&gt; doGossip(), gossipIntervalMs, gossipIntervalMs, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); }\n When the scheduled task is invoked, it picks up a small set of random nodes from the list of servers from the metadata map.

This is fine for a newly joined node, but once the state is up to date, it&#39;s unnecessary to send the complete state. The cluster node just needs to send the state changes since the last gossip. For achieving this, each node maintains a version number which is incremented every time a new metadata entry is added locally.\n   Each value in the cluster metadata is maintained with a version number.

The sender can then immediately respond with the requested metadata. This avoids an extra message that otherwise would have been required.\n Gossip protocol used in  [cockroachdb] maintains state for each connected node. For each connection, it maintains the last version sent to that node, and the version received from that node. This is so that it can send &#39;state since the last sent version&#39; and ask for &#39;state from the last received version&#39;.\n Some other efficient alternatives can be used as well, sending a hash of the entire Map and if the hash is the same, then doing nothing.\n Cluster nodes randomly select the node to send the Gossip message. An example implementation in Java can use java.util.Random as following:\n  private Random random = new Random(); private InetAddressAndPort pickRandomNode(List&lt;InetAddressAndPort&gt; knownClusterNodes) { int randomNodeIndex = random.nextInt(knownClusterNodes.size()); InetAddressAndPort gossipTo = knownClusterNodes.get(randomNodeIndex); return gossipTo; }\n There can be other considerations such as the node that is least contacted with. For example, Gossip protocol in  Cockroachdb selects nodes this way.\n Maintaining the list of available nodes in the cluster is one of the most common usage of Gossip protocols. There are two approaches in use.\n [swim-gossip] uses a separate probing component which continuously probes different nodes in the cluster to detect if they are available. If it detects that the node is alive or dead, that result is propagated to the entire cluster with Gossip communication. The prober randomly selects a node to send the Gossip message. If the receiving node detects that this is new information, it immediately sends the message to a randomly selected node. This way, the failure of a node or newly joined node in the cluster is quickly known to the entire cluster.\n The cluster node can periodically update its own state to reflect its heartbeat. This state is then propagated to the entire cluster through the gossip messages exchanged. Each cluster node can then check if it has received any update for a particular cluster node in a fixed amount of time or else mark that node as down. In this case, each cluster node independently determines if a node is up or down.\n The versioned values does not work well if the node crashes or restarts, as all the in-memory state is lost. More importantly, the node can have different values for the same key. For example, the cluster node can start with a different IP address and port, or can start with a different configuration.  Generation Clock can be used to mark generation with every value, so that when the metadata state is sent to a random cluster node, the receiving node can detect changes not just by the version number, but also with the generation.\n It is useful to note that this mechanism is not necessary for the core Gossip protocol to work. But it&#39;s implemented in practice to make sure that the state changes are tracked correctly.\n [cassandra] uses Gossip protocol for the group membership and failure detection of cluster nodes. Metadata for each cluster node such as the tokens assigned to each cluster node, is also transmitted using Gossip protocol.\n   Blockchain implementations such as  Hyperledger Fabric use Gossip protocol for group membership and sending ledger metadata.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 13:14:43", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u516b\u5366,gossip,\u8282\u70b9", "title": "\u516b\u5366\u4f20\u64ad ", "title_en": "Gossip Dissemination", "transed": 1, "url": "https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/gossip-dissemination.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u516b\u5366", "gossip", "\u8282\u70b9"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "afab6ba73b70acbe35cb9d128ff6eea4.jpeg", "infoid": 1066988, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\n\u8fd9\u662f\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\uff0c\u540c\u6837\u7684\u4eba\u7edd\u5bf9\u575a\u6301\uff0c\u6559\u4f1a\u56fe\u7075\u8bba\u6587\u610f\u5473\u7740Muh\u7535\u8111\u662f\u4e00\u5207\u7684\u5168\u90e8\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u91cd\u590dAI\u5c06\u53d6\u4ee3\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u63d0\u51fa\u7cbe\u5fc3\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e0a\u9762\u5217\u51fa\u7684\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e1c\u897f\u4e5f\u662f\u5982\u6b64\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4eba\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684VLSI\u65f6\u4ee3\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u73b0\u5b9e\u662f\u4ed6\u4eec\u90fd\u5f88\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u4eba\u8d5a\u94b1\u3002\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u88ab\u51fb\u8d25\u7684\u90e8\u843d;\u8058\u8bf7\u4e00\u4e2a\u201cAI\u201d\uff08\u5916\u661f\u4eba\u6216\u79fb\u6c11\uff09\u5974\u96b6\u66f4\u4fbf\u5b9c\uff0c\u4ee5\u5199\u4e0bTerraform\u6216\u7535\u5b50\u524d\u7aef\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u652f\u4ed8\u5de7\u5999\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\uff0c\u8db3\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f7f\u4ed6\u4eec\u66f4\u52a0\u5bcc\u6709\u6210\u6548\uff0c\u4e16\u754c\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5c06\u5438\u6536\u5b83\u5e76\u968f\u7740\u8ba1\u5212\u8fc7\u65f6\u8d2d\u4e70\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u786c\u4ef6\u884c\u4e1a\u5728\u5546\u4e1a\u4e2d\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0d\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u8ba9\u4f60\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u66f4\u8f7b\u677e;\u4ed6\u4eec\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u8425\u9500\uff0c\u4e3a\u5236\u9020\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u7684\u597d\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u60a8\u8d2d\u4e70\u5927\u91cf\u9644\u52a0\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u5347\u7ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u5c3d\u5feb\u78e8\u635f\u3002 ", "note_en": "There are a number of things that people theoretically know how to do, but which aren\u2019t possible because of how software gets made. Some of these are almost forgotten, but there are at least examples of all of them in existence.\n Automated FFI parsers. In 2021 I should be able to point any interpreted language at a C include file and have all the functions described in it turned into reasonably safe FFIed function calls, complete with autogenerated documentation. For example, if I want javascript calls to libsodium, I shouldn\u2019t have to write anything; javascript knows about C APIs. I\u2019m not asking for runtimes to talk to each other, you can keep up the insipid RPC-serialization conga dance for that. I\u2019m just asking for a technology that encapsulates C (and Fortran and \u2026. maybe C++) function calls and makes them accessible to other runtimes without actually doing any work. Of course parsers that do useful things are hard; people would rather write new serialization protocols. There will always be exceptions where such things don\u2019t work, but you should be able to do 95% of the work using metaprogramming. Crap that runs on the JVM; same story -not only could you technically parse .h files and turn them into JNI, you should be able to have all your hooks into Clojure or Scala or whatever without writing anything. Clojure at least seems well equipped to do it, but I\u2019m pretty sure this hasn\u2019t happened yet. You see pieces of  this idea  here and  there, but like everything else about modernity, they suck.\n While I\u2019m talking about FFIs to high level languages, how about a VM that recognizes that it is not a unique snowflake, and that sometimes you have to call a function which may allocate memory outside its stack or something similarly routine but insane. Most VM designs I\u2019ve seen are basically just student exercises; why not assume the outside world exists and has useful things to say? I think Racket has some good  ideas in this domain, but I\u2019m pretty sure it could be done better and there should be a higher standard.\n Cloud providers should admit they\u2019re basically mainframes and write an operating system instead of the ad-hoc collection of horse shit they foist on developers. Imagine if the EC2 were as clean as, I dunno,  z/OS, which has more or less been around since the 1960s. That would be pretty cool. I could read a single book instead of 100 books on all the myriad tools and services and frameworks offered by Oligarch Bezos. He would be hailed as a Jobs-like technical innovator if he had some of his slaves do this, and he would be remembered with gratitude, rather than as the sperdo who dumped his wife for sexorz with lip filler  Cthulhu. There\u2019s no excuse for this from an engineering perspective; Bezos was smart enough to know he was going to do timesharing, he was also smart enough to constrain the spaghetti into something resembling an OS. Same story with all the other cloud services. Really, they should all run like Heroku and you\u2019d never notice they were there. You could also draw flowcharts for most of this shit and replace devops with something that looks like labview. Nobody will do that either, as innovation in core software engineering, or even learning from the past in core software engineering is basically dead.\n Front ends could be drag and drop native GUIs instead of electron apps. There are still examples of this around, but it seems to be a dying paradigm. It\u2019s fascinating to me that people find it easier to write a pile of React and HTML on top of electron rather than dragging and dropping native widgets for a framework like we did in the old days. Literally this was possible on a 286 PC/XT running DOS; it worked great, looked great, had fewer problems. You know why it doesn\u2019t get done? Because doing it is kind of hard, and electron apps are \u201ceasy\u201d in that there are tons of cheap, fungible engineers with those skills.\u00a0 In general  native GUI frameworks are shit and they almost never include a GUI to develop them in. Even if you made something not as shitty as electron; maybe something that took 10mb instead of 500mb and didn\u2019t gobble up all memory on your system that would be amazing. This is completely possible. People used to make GUI frameworks which did  more than electron apps, looked better and fit in the tens of kilobytes range.\n Compilers and interpreters should learn how modern computers work. Pretty much all compilers and interpreters think computers are a PDP-11 stack machine. There are consequences to this everyone knows about: security is fairly execrable. There\u2019s other consequences though! For example, the fact that memory is godawful slow and there are multiple cache speeds is a very serious performance problem unless you\u2019re dealing with trivial amounts of memory. There are no compilers which can help you with this, unless you count meta-compilers on limited problems like ATLAS-BLAS or FFTW. There are a few interpreted languages whose designers have awareness of this and at least don\u2019t fight the OS over these facts, or attempt to insist they\u2019re really running on a PDP-11.\n Operating systems don\u2019t have to look like your crazy hoarder aunt\u2019s house. I know it\u2019s hard to believe, but in my lifetime there were excellent multitasking operating systems with superior GUIs, networking, development toolchains, RTOS subsystems, cryptography that made the NSA nervous, and they all fit on a  70mb tape drive, and they would support something like 20 people checking their email and compiling Fortran for general relativity calculations from emacs terms. Meanwhile, my phone needs a constant diet of gigabyte upgrades to continue functioning reliably as a fucking telephone; telephones theoretically don\u2019t even need a single transistor. Even my linux machines are ridiculously bloated and seem to require daily updates and patches. Why does shit like DPDK exist? Because your OS is stuck in the 1990s when ethernet was 10mbps. There\u2019s zero reason or excuse for this, other than modern programmers are like your crazy hoarder aunt because storage is cheap and competent coder time is expensive. Clean OS design has a lot of follow on benefits, such as rare patching, higher security and lower maintenance in general. I have 4 objects in my house who require constant OS\u00a0 upgrades (used to be 5, but my macbook committed suicide after an \u201cOS upgrade\u201d so I now use it as a paperweight), not including my TV or my car; make a cleaner OS and life actually gets better instead of everyone being a sort of shitty IT slave to keep their refrigerator and telephone running.\u00a0Instead of a nice OS, current year innovation\u00a0 is the open source \u201c code of conduct\u201d -apparently hoping you\u2019ll attract enough people mentally ill enough to work for free, but sane enough to do useful work; arguably a narrow demographic.\n The funny thing is, the same people who absolutely insist that the Church Turing thesis means muh computer is all-powerful simulator of everything, or repeat the fantasy that AI will replace everyone\u2019s jobs will come up with elaborate reasons why these things listed above are too hard to achieve in the corporeal world, despite most of them being solved problems from the VLSI era of computer engineering. The reality is they\u2019re all quite possible, but nobody makes money doing them. Engineers are a defeated tribe; it\u2019s cheaper to hire an \u201cAI\u201d (Alien or Immigrant) slave to write the terraform or electron front end rather than paying clever engineers well enough to build themselves useful tooling to make them more productive and the world a better place. Consumers will suck it up and buy more memory, along with planned obsolescence, keeping the hardware industry in business. Computers aren\u2019t for making your life easier; they\u2019re for surveillance and marketing, and for manufacturers a consumer good they hope you buy lots of add-ons and\u00a0 upgrades for, and which wears out as soon as possible.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 13:14:28", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8f6f\u4ef6,software,\u8d2d\u4e70", "title": "\u660e\u663e\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u521b\u65b0\u6ca1\u6709\u4eba ", "title_en": "Obvious and possible software innovations nobody does", "transed": 1, "url": "https://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/2021/04/01/obvious-and-possible-software-innovations-nobody-does/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8f6f\u4ef6", "software", "\u8d2d\u4e70"]}]
