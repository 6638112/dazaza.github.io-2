Using a quantum trick with light has allowed researchers to examine living cells in unprecedented detail without destroying them, a technique that could improve medical diagnoses and microbiology research.\n The microscopes that are generally used to examine living biological systems shine one or two bright lights on their targets, and\u00a0more powerful light sources allow researchers to see the cells in greater detail. But this approach has\u00a0 a fundamental limit to the precision it can achieve: at some point, a bright enough light will destroy a living cell.\n \u201cOur understanding of life as it is now has relied almost entirely on the quality of our microscopes,\u201d says  Warwick Bowen at the University of Queensland in Australia. \u201cWe\u2019re really limited by technology, and it\u2019s not obvious how to break the existing limits because we\u2019ve already pushed the intensity as high as we can without destroying the cell.\u201d\n  Bowen and his colleagues have found a way to overcome this problem. They used a type of microscope with two laser light sources, but sent one of the beams through a specially designed crystal that \u201csqueezes\u201d the light. It does so by introducing  quantum correlations in the photons \u2013 the particles of light in the laser beam.\n The photons were coupled into correlated pairs, and any of them that had energies unlike the others were discarded instead of being paired off. That process lowered the intensity of the beam while decreasing its noise, which allowed for more precise imaging.\n  When the researchers tested their system, they found that they were able to make measurements that were 35 per cent sharper than a similar device that didn\u2019t use squeezed light.\n  \u201cIn order to achieve this kind of measurement without quantum correlations, you\u2019d have to turn the intensity up,\u201d says Bowen. \u201cBut if you turned up the intensity enough to match these results, you\u2019d destroy the sample, so we\u2019re able to examine things that previously would have been impossible to see.\u201d\n These included the wall of a yeast cell ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which is about 10 nanometres thick, as well as the fluid within a cell, both of which would be faint even with the best non-quantum microscopes, and completely invisible\u00a0with standard microscopes. Observing these  minuscule parts of living tissues could help us understand the basics of life at the smallest scales.\n \u201cThis is a very exciting advance in the field of optical microscopy that opens the door for improving how state-of-the-art microscopes can work, at light intensities that are right at the threshold of damaging biological samples,\u201d says Frank Vollmer at the University of Exeter in the UK.\n Quantum microscopes will also have practical applications, Bowen says. For example, light-based microscopes are often used to  determine if cells are cancerous or to diagnose other diseases, and squeezed light could significantly improve the sensitivity of those tests as well as speeding them up, he says.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 21:09:09", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u663e\u5fae\u955c,microscope", "title": "\u91cf\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u4e2d\u68c0\u67e5\u7ec6\u80de ", "title_en": "Quantum microscope can examine cells in unprecedented detail", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/2280216-quantum-microscope-can-examine-cells-in-unprecedented-detail/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u663e\u5fae\u955c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067028, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u56fe1\uff1a\u540d\u4e3amakefile\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002 \u5bf9\u4e8e\u6559\u80b2\u5185\u5bb9\u7684Smidgeon\uff0c\u8bf7\u6ce8\u610f\u4f7f\u7528$ EUID\uff08\u6709\u6548\u7528\u6237ID\uff09\u800c\u4e0d\u662f$ UID\uff08\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u7528\u6237ID\uff09\u3002 \u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5373\u5927\u591a\u6570\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237ID\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u77ed\u7684\u540d\u79f0\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7528\u6237ID\u51e0\u4e4e\u603b\u662f\u662f\u60a8\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u3002 \u67e5\u770b\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u5173\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6458\u8981\u3002  \u3002\u524d\u9762\uff1a\u6211\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\u3002 \u6211\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\u3002 \u6211\u662f\u6211\u7b54\uff1a@\u771f\u5939\u82af\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\uff1a@ test $$ euid -ne 0\uff06amp;\uff06amp;\uff06amp; echo\uff06\uff0334;\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f \u8ba9\u5b83\u81ea\u5df1\u3002\uff06\uff0334; || \u56de\u58f0\uff06\uff0334;\u597d\u7684\u3002\uff06\uff0334; \u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\uff1a@ test $$ euid -ne 0\uff06amp;\uff06amp;\uff06amp; echo\uff06\uff0334;\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f \u8ba9\u5b83\u81ea\u5df1\u3002\uff06\uff0334; || \u56de\u58f0\uff06\uff0334;\u597d\u7684\u3002\uff06\uff0334;  \u6ce8\u91ca\uff1f \u95ee\u9898\uff1f \u66f4\u6b63\uff1f \u5982\u679c\u60a8\u60f3\u4e0e\u6211\u8054\u7cfb\u6b64\u5e16\u5b50\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u8bf7\u5728ME\u53d1\u9001\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u81f3me@chrismorgan.info\u3002 ", "note_en": "Figure\u00a01: contents of a file named  Makefile.

All that matters is what other people see in it and what buyers are willing to pay.  The 2020\u2019s equivalent of Warhol paintings are  Non-Fungible-Tokens (NFTs). In this essay I\u2019ll explain what NFTs are by motivating them with some interesting real-world problems. Then I\u2019ll discuss why the NFT craze for digital art generates so much ideologically contentious debate. Finally, I\u2019ll discuss some parallels between artistic and financial nihilism, and how this might serve as a framework for thinking about wildly speculative markets.     Suppose you want to buy a Birkin bag or some other luxury brand item. An unauthorized seller \u2014 perhaps someone who needs some emergency cash \u2014 is willing to sell you a Birkin bag. They offer you a good discount, relative to the price the authorized retailer would charge you. But how can you be sure they aren\u2019t selling you a fake? Counterfeits for these items are very high quality, and the average Birkin customer probably can\u2019t tell the difference between a real and a fake.   One way to avoid counterfeits is to only purchase items from an authorized retailer, e.g. a trusted Herm\u00e8s store. But this is not practical because it prevents people from selling or giving away their bags. If you leave your bag to someone in your will, then its authenticity is no longer guaranteed.  So we have the market need: how does a seller pass on or sell a luxury item? How does a buyer ensure that they are buying an authentic item?  One possible answer is for Herm\u00e8s to print out a list of secret serial numbers, perhaps sewn inside the bag, that declare whether a bag is legit or not. Owners receive a serial number when they buy the bag. But this is not a strong deterrent. A counterfeiter could just buy a real bag and then copy its serial number into many fake bags.  What if Herm\u00e8s maintains a public website of who owns which bag? Any time a bag changes ownership, this ledger needs to be updated. By recording a unique owner for each unique serial number, this solves the problem of counterfeiters simply duplicating serial numbers. The process shifts from verifying properties to verifying transactions and owners.  These approaches would work, but has a centralized point of failure: If the Herm\u00e8s website goes down, nobody can trade bags anymore. Herm\u00e8s is a big company and has the resources to protect their website against DDOS attacks and other cybersecurity threat vectors, but smaller luxury brands might not have a state-of-the-art security department. If they are not careful, their security could be breached by hackers or an unscrupulous sysadmin. Also, if Herm\u00e8s stops operating as a company in 25 years, who will maintain the ledger of ownership? If it is a third party company, can we trust them not to abuse that power? Even in the unlikely event that the central point of failure never makes a mistake, it\u2019s still mildly annoying to require Herm\u00e8s to get involved every time a bag changes hands.   What if you could verify transactions and owners, without a centralized party? This is where Non-Fungible Tokens, or NFTs, come in. In 2009, someone  published a landmark paper on how to build a decentralized ledger of who owns what. This ledger is called a &#34;blockchain&#34;. A blockchain is a record of the consensus state of the world, following some agreed-upon protocol that is known to everyone. The remarkable thing about blockchains is that they are decentralized (no central point of failure), and resilient to malicious actors in the network.-Distributed consensus is reached by each individual contributing some resource like money, hash rate, or computer storage. So long as a large fraction of resources in the network are controlled by well-behaved actors, the integrity of the blockchain remains secure. The fraction required typically varies from one-thirds to just over a half.   There are many blockchains out there. The details of how their consensus protocols are implemented are fascinating but beyond the scope of this essay. The important thing to know is that the base technology underlying NFTs and cryptocurrencies is a formal protocol that allows people to come to an agreement on who owns what without having to involve a trusted third party (e.g. Herm\u00e8s, an escrow agent, your bank, or your government). Theoretically speaking, blockchains allow shared consensus in a trustless society.  NFTs are like a paper deed of ownership, but instead of paper the certificate is digital. And unlike a paper deed an NFT cannot be forged. NFTs contain a unique \u201cserial number\u201d that is publicly viewable, but only one person can be said to \u201cpossess\u201d that serial number on the blockchain, much like how home addresses are public but registered to a single owner by the recording office. To see how NFTs solve the Birkin bag counterfeit problem, let\u2019s suppose Herm\u00e8s publicly declares the following for all to hear:   \u201cOwners of True Birkin bags will be issued a digital certificate of authenticity represented by an NFT\u201d  As a buyer, you can be quite confident that the bag is authentic if the seller also owns the NFT, and you can verify that the NFT was indeed originally created by Herm\u00e8s by looking up its public transaction history. During a transaction, the seller simply gives the buyer the bag and tells the blockchain to re-assign ownership of the NFT to the buyer\u2019s digital identifier. If the payment is done in cryptocurrency, the escrow can even be performed  using a smart contract without a centralized party (the seller publishes contract \u201cIf a specific buyer\u2019s wallet address sends me X USDC in 24 hours, send the NFT is sent to them and send the cash to me.\u201d)  NFTs provide the means to implement digital scarcity, but there still needs to be a way to pair it with a real-world item in the \u201canalog\u201d world. A seller could still bypass the security of NFTs by selling you an NFT with a fake Birkin bag. However, for every fake bag you want to sell, you need to purchase a real NFT and the real bag that comes with it. After you sell the NFT with the fake bag, you are left with a real bag with no NFT! Subsequently, the market value of the real bag drops because buyers will be highly suspicious of a seller who says &#34;this is a real bag, I don&#39;t have the NFT because I just sold it with a fake bag.&#34; While NFTs are not sure proof of a physical Birkin bag&#39;s authenticity, they all but ruin the economic incentives of counterfeiting.   What about luxury consumable goods? You could buy NFT-certified Wagyu beef, sell the NFT with some cheaper steak, and then eat the real Wagyu beef - it doesn\u2019t matter what other people think you&#39;re eating. However, NFT transactions are public, so a grocery shopper would be quite suspicious of a food NFT that has changed hands outside of the typical supply chain addresses. For NFTs paired with physical goods, each \u201cunusual\u201d transaction significantly adds to counterfeit risk, which diminishes the economic incentives to counterfeiters. This is especially true for consumable, perishable goods.  Authenticity is useful, even outside of Veblen goods. You can imagine using NFTs to implement anonymous digital identity verification ( a 30B market by 2024), or ship it with food products like meat where the customer cares a lot about the provenance of the product. In Taiwan, there is a current ongoing scandal where a bunch of US-imported pork has been passed off as \u201cdomestic pork\u201d and nobody can trust their butchers anymore.   In the most general case, NFTs can be used to implement provenance tracking of both physical and digital assets - an increasingly important need in our modern age of disinformation. Where did this photo of a politician come from? Who originally produced this audio clip?     NFTs make a lot of sense for protecting the authenticity of luxury goods or implementing single sign-on or tracking the provenance of meat products, but that\u2019s not what they\u2019re primarily used for today. Rather, most people sell NFTs for digital art. Here are some early examples of art NFTs, called \u201cCryptopunks\u201d. Each punk is a 24x24 RGB image.  One of these recently sold for 17M USD in an auction. At first glance, this is perplexing. The underlying digital content - some pixels stored in a file - are freely accessible to anyone. Why would anyone pay so much for a certificate of authenticity on something that anyone can enjoy for free? Is the buyer the one that gets punked?\n It\u2019s easy to dismiss this behavior as poor taste colliding with the arbitrarily large disposable income of rich people, in particular crypto millionaires that swap crypto assets with other crypto millionaires. While this may be true, I think it\u2019s far more interesting to ask \u201cwhat worldview would cause a rational person to bet $17M on a certificate for a 24x24x3 set of pixel values\u201d?   Historically, the lion\u2019s share of rewards for digital content has been owned by distribution technology like Spotify or content aggregators like Facebook, and then split with the management company. The creatives themselves are paid pittances, and do not share in the financialization of their labor. The optimist case for NFT art is as follows: NFTs are decentralized, which means any artist with an internet connection can draw up financial contracts for their art on their own terms. If NFTs revolutionize the business model of digital art, and if the future of art is mostly digital, then the first art NFTs to ever be issued might accrue significant cultural relevance, and that\u2019s why they command such high speculative prices.   Valuing art based on cultural relevance might be a bit absurd, but why is the Mona Lisa \u201cThe Mona Lisa\u201d? da Vinci arguably made \u201cbetter\u201d paintings from a technical standpoint. It&#39;s because of intangible value. The Mona Lisa is valuable because of its cultural proximity to important events and people in history, and the mimetic desire of other humans. In fact, it was a relatively obscure painting until 1911, when it was stolen from the Louvre and became a source of national shame overnight.   All art, from your child\u2019s first finger painting, to an antique heirloom passed down generations, to a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d like the Mona Lisa, are valued this way. They are valuable simply because others deem it valuable.   NFTs are the digital equivalent of buying a  banana duck-taped to a wall; you are betting that in the future, that statement of ownership on some blockchain will be historically significant, which you can presumably trade in for cash or clout or both. But buyer beware: things get philosophically tricky when applying the theory of \u201cintangible value\u201d to digital information and artwork where the cost of replication goes to zero.   I can think of two ways to look at how one values NFTs for digital art. One perspective is that in a world full of fake Birkin bags and products sourced from ethically dubious places, the only thing of value is the certificate of authenticity. The cultural and mimetic value of content has transferred entirely to the provenance certificate, and not the pixels themselves (which can be copied for free). If art\u2019s value is derived from the cultural relevance it represents and its proximity to important people, then the most sensible way to make high art would not be to improve one\u2019s painting skills, but to schmooze with a lot of famous people and insert oneself into important events in history, and issue scarce status symbols for the bourgeoisie. Warhol did exactly that.\u00a0  The alternate view is that if a perfect copy can be made of some pixels, then it is not really a counterfeit at all, and therefore the NFT secures nothing of actual value. Is it meaningful to ascribe a certificate of authenticity to something that can be perfectly replicated? Is \u201cauthenticity\u201d of a stream of 0s and 1s meaningless? There is certainly utility in verifying the source of some information, but anyone can mint an NFT for the same information.  In summary, the Pro-NFT crowd values the intangible \u201ccollector\u2019s scarcity and cultural relevance\u201d. The anti-NFT focuses on tangible value - how much real value does this secure? Both are reasonable frameworks to value things, and you can end up with wildly different conclusions.\n  Convince enough people that a urinal is valuable, and it becomes an investment grade asset. This is no longer merely a matter of art philosophy - when you invest in an index fund, you are essentially reinforcing the market\u2019s current belief of valuations. When people bid up the price of TSLA or GME to stratospheric valuations, the index fund must re-adjust their market-weighted holdings to reflect those prices, creating further money inflows to the asset and thus a  self-fulfilling prophecy. As it turns out, the art-of-investing is much like investing-in-art. As I have suggested in the title of this essay and borrowed from Warhol (who probably borrowed it from Marshall McLuhan),\u00a0 stonks are what you can get away with.\n    We are starting to see this valuation framework being applied to the equities market today, where price movements are dominated by narratives about where the price is going and what other people are willing to pay for it, especially with meme stocks like GME and AMC. Many retail investors don\u2019t really care about whether GME\u2019s price is justified by their corporate earnings - they simply buy at any cost. This financial nihilism - where intrinsic value is unknowable and all that matters is what other people think - is a worldview often encountered in Gen Z retail traders and a surprising number of professional traders I know. Perhaps the  midwit meme is really true.  This is definitely a cause for some concern, but at the same time, I think value investors should keep an open mind that what first seems like irrational behavior might have a method to madness. If you have an irrational force acting in the markets, like shareholders who refuse to sell or lend their stock, a discounted cash flow model for AMC or GME starts to not become very predictive of share price. By reflexivity, that will have impacts on future cash flows! In a similar fashion, using present-day frameworks for thinking about business and value do not account for the disruptive force of technology. That\u2019s why I find NFTs so fascinating - they are an intersection of finance, art, technology, and the nihilistic framework of valuation that is so prevalent in our society today.\u00a0  What is rational behavior for an investor, anyway? Is it \u201cstandard behavior\u201d as measured against the population average? How do you tell apart standard behavior from a collective delusion? Perhaps the luxury bag makers,  Ryan Cohens, and Andy Warhol\u2019s of the world understand it best: Convince the world to believe in your values, and you will be the sanest person on the planet. For fifteen minutes, at least.

Seafood or intelligent marine life?\n A group of Conservative MPs think it&#39;s the latter and argue they should be included in a law to protect animals.\n The Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill recognises animal sentience - which is the capacity of animals to have feelings, including pain and suffering.\n It currently says fish, and other vertebrates which feel pain, should be protected as much as possible.\n Animals like lobsters and octopus are not currently protected by the bill because as invertebrates, their body is different to ours, so they aren&#39;t thought to have those complex feelings, says a report by the  Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation (CAWF).\n  The report says arguments against recognising these species focuses on physical differences between these animals and humans - but this fails to understand what it means for an animal to have feelings.\n   It says those species &#34;undoubtedly experience the world in extremely different ways to ourselves,&#34; but what matters is whether they feel pleasure and pain.\n  &#34;Animals have helped us quite a lot, so we should return the favour and help them,&#34; marine biologist Emily Sullivan tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\n The 25-year-old manages the research aquarium at the Marine Biological Association, which means she&#39;s worked with lots of invertebrates such as octopus, lobster, crabs, crayfish and cuttlefish.\n She feels they should be recognised in the bill - which is currently in the House of Lords.\n  There are already regulations around using animals in scientific research, including octopus and squid - though not all species.\n &#34;The aim of that is to minimise pain, stress and suffering in research,&#34; Emily says.\n  &#34;I personally do think they can recognise and feel pain, so should be protected more.&#34;\n Having interacted with lots of these species, Emily feels they are self-aware and understand what&#39;s around them.\n &#34;It definitely varies between species, and it&#39;s not the same level for all of them. But for example cuttlefish, related to octopus, are very intelligent,&#34; she says.\n &#34;The ones we have here, when you walk past their tank they come up and have a look, see what you&#39;re doing and definitely respond. You can see them watching you.&#34;\n  Emily feels it&#39;s clear when they feel pain or suffering &#34;because their behaviour changes a lot&#34;.\n &#34;They become quite lethargic and their appetite changes. That&#39;s true for a lot of the animals, including crabs and lobsters.&#34;\n  Emily says including them in the bill will have a big impact on the animals themselves because &#34;they aren&#39;t really protected or regulated much&#34;.\n The report found the UK fishing fleet lands more than 420 million of species such as squid, octopus, crabs and lobsters each year, and says &#34;with so many individuals at stake&#34;, it&#39;s important to be cautious even if there&#39;s not complete certainty these animals are sentient.\n  The new animal welfare legislation will mean any new government policy will have to take into account that vertebrate animals can experience feelings including pain or joy.\n That will be decided by a committee made up of animal experts from within the field.\n A spokeswoman from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs told Newsbeat the UK was &#34;proud to have some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world&#34;.\n &#34;We are fully committed to strengthening them further to ensure all animals avoid any unnecessary pain, distress or suffering,&#34; she said.\n She added there is already a review on the feelings of species such as octopus, cuttlefish and squid and the government will &#34;carefully consider the results&#34; of this.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 21:02:05", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7ae0\u9c7c,octopuses,\u52a8\u7269", "title": "MPS\uff1a\u7ae0\u9c7c\u611f\u5230\u75db\u82e6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fdd\u62a4 ", "title_en": "MPs: Octopuses feel pain and need legal protection", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-57528249", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7ae0\u9c7c", "octopuses", "\u52a8\u7269"]}]
