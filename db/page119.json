The group was named \u201cDenisovans\u201d in its honor. Now, an extensive analysis of DNA in the cave\u2019s soils reveals it also hosted modern humans\u2014who arrived early enough that they may have once lived there alongside Denisovans and Neanderthals.\n The new study \u201cgives [researchers] unprecedented insight into the past,\u201d says Mikkel Winther Pedersen, a molecular paleoecologist at the University of Copenhagen who was not involved with the work. \u201cIt literally shows what [before] they have only been able hypothesize.\u201d\n Humans\u2014including Neanderthals and Denisovans\u2014are known to have occupied Denisova Cave for at least 300,000 years. Among the eight human fossils unearthed there are the pinkie, three bones from Neanderthals, and even one from a child  with one Neanderthal and one Denisovan parent. The cave also contains sophisticated stone tools and jewelry at higher, later levels. But no modern human fossils have been found there. Those artifacts,  extensive studies of DNA from these bones, and even  one early study of DNA from soils have cemented the cave\u2019s importance for piecing together human evolution.\n But eight fossils are not much to go on, so Elena Zavala, a graduate student at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, and colleagues teamed up with Russian researchers to see what kind of DNA was present in the soils of the three-chamber cave (see video, below).\n Researchers have been studying DNA isolated from soils for more than 40 years, including  sequencing DNA from permafrost, but only in the past 4 years has anyone  found DNA from extinct humans in ancient soils.\n Working with another team of experts who had previously  dated the layers of the cave, the researchers dug out 728 soil samples. After 2 years of analysis, in which they isolated and sequenced the samples, the researchers found human DNA in 175 of them. That makes the study \u201cthe largest and most systematic of its kind,\u201d says Katerina Douka, an archaeological scientist at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History who was not involved in the work.\n    The data reveal\u00a0 a complex history of human and animal habitation, with different groups moving in and out of the cave over time, Zavala and her colleagues report today in\u00a0 Nature. Their work confirms that Denisovans were the cave\u2019s first human inhabitants, about 300,000 years ago. They disappeared 130,000 years ago, only to be followed by a different group of Denisovans, who likely made many of the stone tools, some 30,000 years later. Neanderthals appeared on the scene about 170,000 years ago, with different groups using the cave at various points in time, some overlapping with the Denisovans.\n The last to arrive were modern humans, who showed up about 45,000 years ago. The soil layer that corresponds with that period contained DNA from all three human groups, the researchers report. \u201cThe time periods [of each layer] are quite large, so we can\u2019t concretely say if they overlapped or not,\u201d Zavala says. But, Douka adds, \u201cI cannot think of another site where three human species lived through time.\u201d\n Given the jewelry and sophisticated artifacts in later layers, some researchers had\u00a0 suspected moderns\u00a0had been there. But no one knew they had arrived as early as 45,000 years ago\u2014and overlapped with both of our archaic cousins. \u201cIt suggests a more complicated interplay between archaic and modern humans,\u201d says Ron Pinhasi, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of Vienna who was not involved with the work.\n The soil samples also yielded DNA from many species of animals. About 170,000 years ago, the climate went from warmer to colder, and Neanderthals moved in, so did different species of hyenas and bears.\n It\u2019s the combination of genomic data from both the fossils and the soil samples that really makes the new work stand out, Pinhasi says. \u201cIt\u2019s a superpromising direction [for future work].\u201d Douka agrees, and says the new study should help ancient soil DNA become \u201ca mainstream archaeological tool.\u201d She is already amazed at the progress that it, combined with other studies, has made possible. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that as recently as in 2010 we had\u00a0absolutely no evidence that Denisovans existed, and that these various hominins ever met, let alone that they interbred\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0and co-existed for millennia,\u201d she wrote in an email.", "posttime": "2021-06-26 15:09:46", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6d1e\u7a74,cave,\u4eba\u7c7b", "title": "\u897f\u4f2f\u5229\u4e9a\u6d1e\u7a74\u4e3b\u6301\u4e86Neanderthals\uff0cDenisovans\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b ", "title_en": "Siberian cave hosted Neanderthals, Denisovans, and modern humans", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/06/ancient-siberian-cave-hosted-neanderthals-denisovans-and-modern-humans-possibly-same", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6d1e\u7a74", "cave", "\u4eba\u7c7b"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1068393, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters", "note_en": "{ &#34;tiddlers&#34;: { &#34;$:/Acknowledgements&#34;: { &#34;title&#34;: &#34;$:/Acknowledgements&#34;, &#34;text&#34;: &#34;TiddlyWiki incorporates code from these fine OpenSource projects:\\n\\n* [[The Stanford Javascript Crypto Library|http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/]]\\n* [[The Jasmine JavaScript Test Framework|http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/]]\\n* [[Normalize.css by Nicolas Gallagher|http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/]]\\n\\nAnd media from these projects:\\n\\n* World flag icons from [[Wikipedia|http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:SVG_flags_by_country]]\\n&#34; }, &#34;$:/core/copyright.txt&#34;: { &#34;title&#34;: &#34;$:/core/copyright.txt&#34;, &#34;type&#34;: &#34;text/plain&#34;, &#34;text&#34;: &#34;TiddlyWiki created by Jeremy Ruston, (jeremy [at] jermolene [dot] com)\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2004-2007, Jeremy Ruston\\nCopyright (c) 2007-2020, UnaMesa Association\\nAll rights reserved.\\n\\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\\n\\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\\n list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\\n\\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\\n this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation\\n and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\\n\\n* Neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its\\n contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from\\n this software without specific prior written permission.\\n\\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS &#39;AS IS&#39;\\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\\nDISCLAIMED.

", "note_en": "The Neotron Pico is based around the idea of the  Neotron-32, but using a low-cost Raspberry Pi Pico instead of a Texas Instuments Tiva-C Launchpad. It also stretches out to full micro-ATX size, and adds more expansion slots so that you can easily design and add your own peripherals.\n   The Raspberry Pi Pico is the core of the Neotron Pico. It uses PIO statemachines to generate 12-bit Super VGA video, and digital 16 bit 48 kHz stereo audio. It also has both I\u00b2C and SPI buses. SPI chipselects and IRQs are handled by an SPI-to-GPIO expander. This provides eight chip-selects and eight IRQs, to support up to eight expansion slots or peripherals. The eight chip-selects are gated with a tri-state bus transceiver, allowing the Pico to talk to either the I/O exander, or the selected expansion slot. The board has an SD Card fitted in the &#39;Slot 1&#39; position, and the Board Management Controller in the &#39;Slot 0&#39; position, leaving &#39;Slot 2&#39; through to &#39;Slot 7&#39; available for expansion. Each expansion slot has both I\u00b2C and SPI, along with unique chip-select and IRQ signals.\n  The Neotron Pico is designed to run the Neotron OS - a CP/M or MS-DOS alike OS written in Rust. But, being open-hardware, you can program your Neotron Pico to do pretty much anything.\n  12-bit (4096 colour) VGA video output Capable of 640x480 @ 60 Hz 16-colour and 320x240 @ 60 Hz 256-colour graphics modes\n     The limited I/O on the Pico (we are using half the available pins just for the video output) is supplemented using a Microchip MCP23S17 SPI to GPIO expander, and an octal buffer. See the  I/O Expanders section for more details.\n   The Raspberry Pi Silicon RP2040 generates 12-bit VGA video at a range of standard resolutions (including 640x480 @ 60 Hz).\n  The design could easily be adapted to remove the TPF133A/THS7316 video buffer and the TPD7S019 level shifter/filter, and instead use the  1BitSquared DVI PMOD board if you prefer a DVI output (using an HDMI connector).\n  The audio subsystem offers 16-bit 48 kHz stereo audio in and out through a classic blue/green/pink triple 3.5mm TRS jack. Input and Output volume can be software controlled.\n Extra line-level output pin header (e.g. for additional RCA audio jacks - operates in addition to 3.5mm headphone jack output)\n Internal line-level input pin header (e.g. for CD-ROM audio - disabled when 3.5mm line-in jack in-use)\n  Power-on Reset sequencing, soft shutdown, voltage monitoring and PS/2 interfacing is handled by a separate STM32F0 SoC.\n   Note that in the above table, the UART signals are wired as  Data Terminal Equipment (DTE).\n This design should also be pin-compatible with the following SoCs (although the software may need recompiling):\n  Note that not all STM32 pins are 5V-tolerant, and the PS/2 protocol is a 5V open-collector system, so ensure that whichever part you pick has 5V-tolerant pins (marked  FT or  FTt in the datasheet) for the PS/2 signals. All of the parts above  should be OK, but they haven&#39;t been tested. Let us know if you try one!\n      Because we used so many pins on the Pico for Audio and Video, we don&#39;t have enough pins to use for  Chip Select lines. Each device we wish to communicate with on the SPI bus must have a unique chip select line and so have limited lines means we could only have a limited number of SPI devices.\n However, in this design, we cheat and use a Microchip MCP23S17 I/O expander. This is an SPI peripheral with 16 GPIO pins that can be controlled by sending it commands over SPI. It also has an IRQ output which be programmed to fire when the input pins match a certain state.\n The problem would come when the Pico has finished talking to our select SPI device - how does it tell the MCP23S17 to release the current chip select, without the SPI bus traffic also going to the currently selected expansion slot? We resolve this by using a simple 8-bit buffer with an enable pin. This allows the Pico to disconnect all of the chip select signals at once, regardless of the output of the MCP23S17. Once this is disabled, we know we are talking to only the MCP23S17 and the Pico can command it to select the next chip select of interest to us.\n Interrupts are also processed through the MCP23S17. We configure the device to provide an IRQ (edge, active low) whenever any of the eight IRQ inputs are active (programmable for edge or level, active high/rising or low/falling). When the Pico receives an IRQ from the MCP23S17, it must do a read of the pins (using SPI) to find out which device actually raised the interrupt. This model is similar to that used in the IBM PC - where the Intel 8088 must talk to an Intel 8259A programmable interrupt controller over the ISA bus to find out which interrupt was raised - except that in our case, our CPU is very fast and our bus is pretty slow, so our interrupt latency isn&#39;t very good. Worse, if there is a big SPI transaction happening (such as transferring a 512 byte block from an SD card) when an interrupt fires, the Pico will have to wait for that to complete before it can talk to the MCP23S17 to handle the IRQ. That or it could just drop the SPI transaction mid-way through and re-try it later (if your expansion device can tolerate such rudeness).\n +------+ +-----+| |----------OUTPUT_EN--------------&gt;| || | | || | +----------+ | || | | | | || | | |----CS0---&gt;| |----CS0----------------------------------+| | | | | | || | | |----CS1---&gt;| B |----CS1------------------------------+ || | | | | U | | || | | |----CS2---&gt;| F |----CS2--------------------------+ | || | | | | F | | | || | | |----CS3---&gt;| E |----CS3----------------------+ | | || | | | | R | | | | || | | |----CS4---&gt;| |----CS4------------------+ | | | || | | | | | | | | | || | | |----CS5---&gt;| |----CS5--------------+ | | | | || | | | | | | | | | | || | | |----CS6---&gt;| |----CS6----------+ | | | | | || Pico | | MCP23S17 | | | | | | | | | || | | |----CS7---&gt;| |----CS7------+ | | | | | | || | | | +-----+ v v v v v v v v| | | | +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+| |----CS----&gt;| | | S | S | S | S | S | S | S | S || |&lt;---IRQ----| | | l | l | l | l | l | l | l | l || |&lt;===SPI===&gt;| |&lt;============SPI============&gt;| o | o | o | o | o | o | o | o || | | | | t | t | t | t | t | t | t | t || | | | | | | | | | | | || | | | | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 || | | | +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+| | | |&lt;---IRQ7-----------------------+ | | | | | | || | | | | | | | | | || | | |&lt;---IRQ6---------------------------+ | | | | | || | | | | | | | | || | | |&lt;---IRQ5-------------------------------+ | | | | || | | | | | | | || | | |&lt;---IRQ4-----------------------------------+ | | | || | | | | | | || | | |&lt;---IRQ3---------------------------------------+ | | || | | | | | || | | |&lt;---IRQ2-------------------------------------------+ | || | | | | || | | |&lt;---IRQ1-----------------------------------------------+ || | | | || | | |&lt;---IRQ0---------------------------------------------------++------+ +----------+\n  The seven expansion sockets allow you to add on I\u00b2C or SPI based devices at a later date. Each provides a single chip-select and a single IRQ line - the motherboard design should ensure each socket gets a unique signal for each of these. Each expansion device should also contain a AT24C256 or similar EEPROM device. To allow these EEPROM devices to be scanned, each slot also contains three  EEPROM_ADDRESS pins, tied to Vcc or GND in a unique combination. These should be connected through to the EEPROM address lines on your AT24C256, thus ensuring that each expansion card has its EEPROM at a unique address - 0x50 on Slot 0 through to a maximum possible 0x57 for Slot 7. Where your board has on-board devices, you should fit an AT24C256 EEPROM for each device so that the on-board devices can be discovered, exactly as if they were on an expansion card.\n The expansion slot is a simple 2x10 header. We suggest the use of a TE card-edge connector, but you could equally use two 1x10 pin-headers if desired.\n  SPI_COPI 1 2 GND SPI_CIPO 3 4 GND SPI_CLK 5 6 GND ~SPI_CS 7 8 ~IRQ I2C_SDA 9 10 I2C_SCL EEPROM_ADDR0 11 12 EEPROM_ADDR1 EEPROM_ADDR2 13 14 ~RESET 5V 15 16 5V 3V3 17 18 3V3 GND 19 20 GND\n Four expansion slots line up with the ATX case expansion brackets, allowing you to use cards with external connectors. Note that these are aligned the &#34;PCI way around&#34; with components facing away from the board&#39;s I/O area, rather than the &#34;ISA way around&#34; which would have the components facing the I/O area.

"The following story happened in 1985 but subsequently vanished into obscurity. Over the years, many details have been twisted, others created. Even the original storytellers got some things just plain wrong. After extensive research, writer Nickolai Belakovski is able to present, for the first time to an English-speaking audience, the complete story of Soyuz T-13\u2019s mission to save Salyut 7, a fascinating piece of in-space repair history.\n  It\u2019s getting dark, and Vladimir Dzhanibekov is cold. He has a flashlight, but no gloves. Gloves make it difficult to work, and he needs to work quickly. His hands are freezing, but it doesn\u2019t matter. His crew\u2019s water supplies are limited, and if they don\u2019t fix the station in time to thaw out its water supply, they\u2019ll have to abandon it and go home, but the station is too important to let that happen. Quickly, the sun sets. Working with the flashlight by himself is cumbersome, so Dzhanibekov returns to the ship that brought them to the station to warm up and wait for the station to complete its pass around the night side of the Earth. [1]\n He\u2019s trying to rescue Salyut 7, the latest in a series of troubled yet increasingly successful Soviet space stations. Its predecessor, Salyut 6, finally returned the title of longest manned space mission to the Soviets, breaking the 84-day record set by Americans on Skylab in 1974 by 10 days. A later mission extended that record to 185 days. After Salyut 7\u2019s launch into orbit in April 1982, the first mission to the new station further extended that record to 211 days. The station was enjoying a relatively trouble-free start to life. [4]\n However, this was not to last. On February 11, 1985, while Salyut 7 was in orbit on autopilot awaiting its next crew, mission control (TsUP) noticed something was off. Station telemetry reported that there had been a surge of current in the electrical system, which led to the tripping of overcurrent protection and the shutdown of the primary radio transmitter circuits. The backup radio transmitters had been automatically activated, and as such there was no immediate threat to the station. Mission controllers, very tired now that the end of their 24-hour shift was approaching, made a note to call specialists from the design bureaus for the radio and electrical systems. The specialists would analyze the situation, and produce a report and recommendation, but for now the station was fine, and the next shift was ready to come on duty.[9]\n Without waiting for the specialists to arrive, or perhaps not bothering to call them in the first place, the controllers on the next shift decided to reactivate the primary radio transmitter. Perhaps the overcurrent protection had been tripped accidentally, and if not, then it should still be functional and should still activate if there really was a problem. The controllers, acting against established tradition and procedures of their office, sent the command to reactivate the primary radio transmitter. Instantly, a cascade of electrical shorts swept through the station, and knocked out not only the radio transmitters, but also the receivers. At 1:20pm and 51 seconds on February 11, 1985, Salyut 7 fell silent and unresponsive. [8][9]\n  The situation put flight controllers in an uncomfortable position. One option available to them was to simply abandon Salyut 7 and wait for its successor, Mir, to become available before continuing the manned space program. Mir was on schedule to be launched within one year, but waiting for Mir to become available would not only mean suspending the space program for a year; it also meant that a significant amount of scientific work and engineering tests planned for Salyut 7 would have to go undone. Moreover, admitting defeat would be an embarrassment for the Soviet space program, particularly painful considering the multitude of previous failures in the Salyut series as well as the apparent successes the Americans were enjoying with the Space Shuttle. [9]\n    There was only one other option: fly a repair crew to the station to fix it from the inside, manually. But this could easily become yet another failure. The standard procedures for docking to a space station were entirely automated and relied heavily on information from the station itself about its precise orbital and spatial coordinates. During those rare occurrences when the automated system failed and a manual approach was required, the failures were all within several hundred meters of the station. How does one approach a silent space station? [9] The lack of communication presented another problem: there was no way to know the status of the onboard systems. While the station was designed to fly autonomously, the automated systems could only cope with so many failures before human intervention would be required.\u00a0The station could be fine upon the repair crew&#39;s arrival, requiring no more repair work than replacing the damaged transmitters, or there could have been a fire on the station, or it could have depressurized from having been struck by space debris, etc.; there would be no way to know.[3]\n If there was a meeting in which top managers discussed and weighed all the options, the notes of that meeting have not been made public. What *is* known, however, is that the Soviets decided to attempt a repair mission. This would mean rewriting the book on docking procedures from scratch and hoping that nothing else went wrong aboard the station while communication was down, because if something else did go wrong, the repair crew might not be able to handle it. It was a bold move.\n  The first order of business for the repair mission was figuring out how they would get to the station. For an approach to the station under better circumstances, the Soyuz (a 3-seat ship used to ferry cosmonauts to and from space stations) would receive information from the station via mission control (TsUP) as soon as it reached orbit, long before the station would be visible to the crew. This communication would contain information about the orbit of the space station so that the visiting craft could plot a rendezvous orbit. Once the two craft were 20-25km apart, a direct line of communication would be established between the station and the ship, and the automated system would bring the two craft together and complete the docking.[3]\n  Although all Soyuz pilots were trained to perform a manual docking, it was rare for the automated system to fail. Of those rare failures, the worst was in June 1982 on Soyuz T-6 when a computer failure stopped the automated docking process 900m away from the station. Vladimir Dzhanibekov immediately took over controls and successfully docked his Soyuz with Salyut 7 a full 14 minutes ahead of schedule [4]. Naturally, Dzhanibekov was the leading candidate to pilot any proposed mission to rescue Salyut 7.\n An entirely new set of docking techniques had to be developed, and this was done under a project titled \u201cdocking with a non-cooperative object.\u201d [5] The station\u2019s orbit would be measured using ground-based radar, and this information would be communicated to the Soyuz, which would then plot a rendezvous course. The goal was to get the ship within 5km of the station, from which point it was deemed a manual docking was technically possible. [3] The conclusion of those responsible for developing these new techniques were that the odds of mission success were 70 to 80 percent, after proper modifications to the Soyuz. [2],[3] The Soviet government accepted the risk, deeming the station too valuable to simply let it fall from orbit uncontrolled.\n    Modifications to the Soyuz began. The automated docking system would be removed entirely, and a laser rangefinder installed in the cockpit to assist the crew in determining their distance and approach rate. The crew would also bring night vision goggles in case they had to dock with the station on the night side. The third seat of the ship was removed, and extra supplies, like food and, as would later prove critical, water, were brought on board. The weight saved by the removal of the automatic system and the third chair were used to fill the propellant tanks to their maximum possible level. [1],[3],[11]\n  When it came to selecting a flight crew, two things were very important. First of all, the pilot should have had experience performing a manual docking in orbit, not just in simulators, and secondly, the flight engineer would need to be very familiar with Salyut 7\u2019s systems. Only three cosmonauts had completed a manual docking in orbit. Leonid Kizim, Yuri Malyshev, and Vladimir Dzhanibekov. Kizim had only recently returned from a long duration mission to Salyut 7, and was still undergoing rehabilitation from his spaceflight, which ruled him out as a possible candidate. Malyshev had limited spaceflight experience, and had not trained for Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA, or spacewalk), which would be required later in the mission to augment the station\u2019s solar panels, provided the rehabilitation of the space station went well.[1]\n This left Dzhanibekov, who had flown in space four times for a week or two each time, but had trained for long duration missions and for EVA. However, he was restricted from long duration flight by the medical community. Being at the top of the short list for mission commander, Dzhanibekov was quickly placed into the care of physicians who, after several weeks of medical tests and evaluation, cleared him for a flight lasting no more than 100 days. [1]\n To fulfill the role of flight engineer the list was even shorter: just one person. Victor Savinikh had flown once before, on a 74 day mission to Salyut 6. During that mission he played host to Dzhanibekov and Mongolia\u2019s first cosmonaut as they visited the station on Soyuz 39. Moreover, he was already in the process of training for the next long-duration mission to Salyut 7, which had been scheduled to launch on May 15, 1985. [1]\n By the middle of March, the crew had been firmly decided. Vladimir Dzhanibekov and Victor Savinikh were chosen to attempt one of the boldest, most complicated in-space repair efforts to date. [1]\n  On June 6, 1985, nearly four months after contact with the station had been lost, Soyuz T-13 launched with Vladimir Dzhanibekov as commander and Victor Savinikh as flight engineer. [1],[6] After two days of flight, the station came into view.\n As they approached the station, live video from their ship was being transmitted to ground controllers. To the right\u00a0is one of the images controllers saw.\n The controllers noticed something very wrong: the station\u2019s solar arrays weren\u2019t parallel. This indicated a serious failure in the system which orients the solar panels toward the sun, and immediately led to concerns about the entire electrical system of the station. [1]\n  Dzhanibekov: \u201cDistance, 200 meters. Engaging engines. Approaching the station at 1.5 m/s, rotational speed of the station is normal, it\u2019s practically stable. We\u2019re holding, and beginning our turn. Oh, the sun is in a bad spot now\u2026 there, that\u2019s better. Docking targets aligned. Offset between the ship and the station within normal parameters. Slowing down\u2026 waiting for contact.\u201d\n Silently, slowly, the crew\u2019s Soyuz flew toward the forward docking port of the station.\n  The successful docking to the station was a great victory, and demonstrated for the first time in history that it was possible to rendezvous and dock with virtually any object in space, but it was early to celebrate. The crew received no acknowledgement, either electrical or physical, from the station of their docking. One of the main fears about the mission, that something else would go seriously wrong while the station was out of contact, was quickly becoming a reality.\n A lack of information on the crew\u2019s screens about the pressure inside the station led to concerns that the station had de-pressurized, but the crew pressed ahead, carefully. Their first step would be to try to equalize the pressure between the ship and the station, if possible.

", "note_en": "The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed a range of disease phenotypes in infected patients with asymptomatic, mild, or severe clinical outcomes, but the mechanisms that determine such variable outcomes remain unresolved. In this study, we identified immunodominant CD8 T-cell epitopes in the spike antigen using a novel TCR-binding algorithm. The predicted epitopes induced robust T-cell activation in unexposed donors demonstrating pre-existing CD4 and CD8 T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 antigen. The T-cell reactivity to the predicted epitopes was higher than the Spike-S1 and S2 peptide pools in the unexposed donors. A key finding of our study is that pre-existing T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is contributed by TCRs that recognize common viral antigens such as Influenza and CMV, even though the viral epitopes lack sequence identity to the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. This finding is in contrast to multiple published studies in which pre-existing T-cell immunity is suggested to arise from shared epitopes between SARS-CoV-2 and other common cold-causing coronaviruses. However, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 reactive T-cells are likely to be present in many individuals because of prior exposure to flu and CMV viruses.\n     Uncovering the immunological responses to COVID-19 infection will help in designing and developing next-generation therapies and manage the treatment of critical COVID-19 patients. Many host factors associated with mild or severe disease symptoms have been reported. For example, leukopenia, exhausted CD8 T-cells, higher levels of T H2 cytokines in serum, a high titer of neutralizing antibodies, blunted interferon response, dysregulation of the myeloid cell compartment, activated NK cells, and the size of the na\u00efve T-cell compartment is associated with critically ill patients  1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This wide range of variable factors shares a common immunological underpinning\u2014that of a systemic dysregulation in immune homeostasis due to the failure of the host immune system to clear the virus during the early stages of the infection  6. Animal and human studies have demonstrated that susceptibility to respiratory virus infections is associated with compromised CD8 T-cell immunity  7, 8, 9, 10, 11. A delay in the activation of CD8 T-cells and a lack of early IFN-\u03b3 production by the innate immune arm leads to an increase in viral load triggering overactivation of the innate and the adaptive arm of the immune system leading to a loss of immune homeostasis resulting in severe disease phenotype, including death. Therefore, an early wave of strong CD8 T-cell response may delay viral titer build-up, allowing rapid clearance of the virus by the immune system without perturbing immune homeostasis.\n Healthy humans not exposed to COVID-19 show pre-existing CD4 and CD8 T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens  12, 13, 14. The pre-existing immunity to CD4 and CD8 T-cells was detected against structural and non-structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins by overlapping 15-mer peptide pools. The existence of a pool of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells in unexposed individuals is thought to arise from coronaviruses that cause common cold  13, 15, 16. Whether pre-existing immunity provides any protection to SARS-CoV-2 infection or contributes to a faster recovery from infection remains speculative. Besides, it is unclear whether a pre-existing immunity, involving either CD4 or CD8 T-cells, or both, is required for maximal protection. Identifying robust pre-existing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in the healthy population can be used as a measure to assess the mode of recovery and also viral spread in the global population.\n In this study, we identified strong CD8 T-cell-activating epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by a combination of epitope prediction and T-cell activation assays in healthy donors unexposed to SARS-CoV-2. The rationale for identifying epitopes that favor CD8 T-cell activation was twofold. First, robust CD8 T-cell activating epitopes can be formulated as second-generation vaccines for short and long-term protection against viral infection. Second, detection of pre-existing immunity in healthy donors using epitopes that favor CD8 T-cell activation may provide a framework to understand the complex immune responses observed in clinical settings. It may also shed light on the differences in morbidity and mortality in different population groups across the globe.\n We developed a proprietary algorithm OncoPeptVAC to predict CD8 T-cell activating epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. OncoPeptVAC predicts binding of the HLA-peptide complex to the T-cell receptor (TCR). We selected a cocktail of eleven 15-mer peptides with a broad class-I and class-II coverage and favorable TCR engagement predicted by the algorithm. The cocktail of peptides was tested for T-cell activation in healthy donors from the USA and India unexposed to COVID-19. We observed higher CD8 T-cell activation by the 11-peptide pool compared to the overlapping 15-mer peptide pools from the spike-S1 and S2 proteins. Homology analysis of the selected peptides with other coronavirus spike proteins indicated a lack of significant amino acid identity with any of the 11 peptides, suggesting engagement of one or more peptides in the pool to cross-reactive TCRs from other viruses, not particularly from a coronavirus. Bulk and single-cell TCR analysis revealed expanded clonotypes recognizing epitopes from CMV, Influenza-A, and other viruses to which most of us are exposed. Taken together, our findings support that strong pre-existing CD8 T-cell immunity in unexposed donors is contributed by cross-reactive TCRs from other viruses. Significantly, we discovered multiple immunodominant epitopes in our predicted pool of peptides that favored CD8 T-cell activation. Finally, we show that our cocktail of 11-peptides induced a robust immune response in convalescent patients demonstrating that these peptides are recognized by infected patients. Taken together, our study uncovered strong pre-existing CD8 T-cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2 using a small set of 11 epitopes that engaged cross-reactive TCRs recognizing epitopes from other viruses, not necessarily common cold viruses belonging to the coronavirus family as hypothesized by other studies. Additionally, our findings raise the possibility that many individuals carrying antigen-experienced T-cells against other viruses may be naturally protected against COVID-19 without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n A deep CNN model OncoPeptVAC was implemented to predict the immunogenicity of peptides based only on the peptide and HLA sequences. A total of 8870 immunogenic and non-immunogenic peptide-HLA pairs were obtained from the IEDB  17. The BLOSUM encoding was used to represent the peptide and HLA molecules. The BLOSUM substitution scores encode evolutionary and physicochemical properties of the amino acids  18. In addition, hydrophobicity indices and predicted HLA binding scores were also used to represent the peptide and HLA sequences.\n OncoPeptVAC used the CNN model with multiple 2D convolutional layers combined with max-pooling to confirm the additive effect of different input features on the performance of the model. All the model versions were trained using fivefold cross-validation. The AUC of the final model was 0.87 based on a blind test dataset (Fig.\u00a0 1A). The prediction algorithm showed a sensitivity of 0.64 and a specificity of 0.84 based on the score cut-off of 0.2 (Fig.\u00a0 1B). By increasing the cut-off score to 0.5, the specificity could be further increased to 96.8 with a concomitant loss in sensitivity. OncoPeptVAC reduced the number of false positives significantly compared to the HLA-binding rank (Compare Fig.\u00a0 1B,C) reducing the number of epitopes by 30% that needed to be screened in a T-cell activation assay to identify true immunogenic epitopes. For example, to identify 50% (119 out of 238) of the immunogenic peptide-HLA pairs present in the blind test dataset, 256 top peptide-HLA pairs from OncoPeptVAC prediction needed to be screened, compared to 753 top peptide-HLA pairs predicted by netMHCpan-4.0.\n Identification of immunogenic epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 by OncoPeptVAC. ( A) ROC curves of OncoPeptVAC TCR-binding and netMHCpan-4.1 HLA binding algorithms. A blind dataset of non-immunogenic or immunogenic HLA class-I binding T-cell epitopes from IEDB was used to assess the performance of OncoPeptVAC (cyan). The HLA-binding affinity of the epitopes expressed as percentile rank\u2009&lt;\u20091% was used to assess the performance of netMHCpan-4.1 in predicting true immunogenic epitopes (orange).

( F) HLA-A, B and C-restricted epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 proteome.\n The prediction algorithm was applied to the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and screened against 23 class-I HLAs covering over 98% of the world population. A schematic of the in silico screening approach is shown in Fig.\u00a0 1D. Briefly, 9\u201311-mer peptides from the SARS-CoV-2 proteome were screened for TCR-binding against 23 HLA, and peptides with OncoPeptVAC score\u2009&gt;\u20090.2 were analyzed for class-I HLA binding. Peptide-HLA pairs with a high predicted binding affinity (&lt;\u20091 percentile rank) were selected, their length extended to 15-mer, and screened for class-II HLA binding (See \u201c Methods\u201d for details). Peptides with favorable TCR binding and class-I/II HLA binding features were selected for further validation. The number of predicted immunogenic epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 protein-coding genes is shown in Fig.\u00a0 1E. The distribution of OncoPeptVAC scores against different class-I HLA genes indicates a higher number of favorable TCR-binding peptides for HLA-B and C compared to HLA-A (Fig.\u00a0 1F). Natural biases in HLA restrictions have been reported for immunogenic HIV epitopes  19.\n  We performed T-cell activation assay using a set of 11 prioritized epitopes from the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen (Table  1) in unexposed donors. We selected epitopes from the spike antigen because it is highly immunogenic and generates strong B and T-cell responses. Besides, identifying strong immunogenic epitopes from the spike antigen can become useful reagents to study mechanisms of immune toxicity, and for long-term immune monitoring studies in na\u00efve and vaccinated populations. The 15-mer peptides contained in the 11 selected epitopes cover different segments of the RBD and the non-RBD regions of the spike antigens and few peptides harbor ACE2 receptor binding sites (Fig.\u00a0 2A and Table  1). Many of the predicted peptides reside in flexible regions of the spike protein that could favor efficient processing and presentation. Only two out of the 11 peptides showed 100% identity to the 315 peptides present in the spike-S1 and S2 pools obtained from a commercial vendor (Table  2) (See the \u201c Methods\u201d section for the creation of the peptide pool).\n  T-cell reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 Spike peptide pools and OncoPeptVAC prioritized peptides. Reactivity was determined by intracellular IFN-\u03b3 staining and surface expression of 4-1BB by FACS after stimulation of PBMCs from unexposed donors (n\u2009=\u200914) using separate pools of Spike-S1 and S2 peptides and the 11-Peptide-mix predicted by OncoPeptVAC (see \u201c Methods\u201d).

( G,H) CD8 T-cell response of donors D167 and D089 to individual peptides from the 11-peptide-mix.

Activation of T-cells using the cocktail of 11 peptides (All-peptide mix) was compared to the responses from Spike-S1 (157 peptides) and S2 (158 peptides) pools (see \u201c Methods\u201d for assay details). At 48\u00a0h, the All peptide-mix induced a strong IFN-\u03b3 response in CD8 T-cells (Fig.\u00a0 2B left panel), and a weaker response in CD4 T-cells (Fig.\u00a0 2C, left panel). The IFN-\u03b3 response by the All peptide-mix was stronger in CD8 T-cells, compared to responses from spike-S1 and S2 peptide pools (Fig.\u00a0 2B, left panel). The 4-1BB response in both cell types was weaker at 48\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a0 2B,C right panels). IFN-\u03b3 levels increased in CD8 T-cells at day-7 by the All-peptide mix compared to the Spike peptide pools (Fig.\u00a0 2C, left panel). The higher expression of IFN-\u03b3 and 4-1BB in the CD4 and CD8 T-cells in certain donors at\u00a07-day suggested de novo activation (Fig.\u00a0 2D,E). At 48\u00a0h, 70% of the unexposed donors showed\u2009&gt;\u20090.5% IFN-\u03b3 response in CD8 T-cells to the predicted peptide mix suggesting recall to pre-existing antigen-experienced CD8 T-cells (Fig.\u00a0 2F). In most donors, the maximal response was detected by 7-days, but in donors D142 and D176 the response peaked at 48\u00a0h and declined thereafter (Fig.\u00a0 2F). Although the use of 15-mer peptides is expected to skew the response towards CD4 T-cells, we observed a stronger CD8 T-cell response to the Peptide-mix suggesting that the 15-mer peptide though added exogenously, was processed and presented by class-I HLAs efficiently. Taken together, the results demonstrate that the use of OncoPeptVAC identified potent CD8 T-cell epitopes in the spike antigen that could not have been detected by using large overlapping peptide pools used in T-cell activation assays.\n Next, we tested individual peptides from the mix to assess their contribution to T-cell activation. The magnitude and kinetics of IFN-\u03b3 and 4-1BB induction in CD8 T-cells by individual peptides were variable in different donors (Fig.\u00a0 2G,H and Figure  S1,  S2). Peptide-7 was an exceptionally strong CD8 T-cell epitope inducing IFN-\u03b3 in 3 out of 7 donors (Fig.\u00a0 2G,H and Supplementary Figure  S1E). Most immunogenic epitopes activated CD8 T-cells at 48\u00a0h and achieved\u2009&gt;\u20092% activation by 7-day. The early activation at 48\u00a0h suggested that these epitopes engaged pre-existing T-cell immunity in the unexposed donors. However, activation at day-7 could come from both pre-existing and na\u00efve T-cells. In many donors, a strong CD4 T-cell response was detected by individual peptides (Figure  S3-4). Interestingly, in many donors, both IFN-\u03b3 and 4-1BB expression was induced by multiple individual peptides, although the magnitude of response by the All-peptide mix was not always additive (compare donor responses to the All peptide mix, Fig.\u00a0 2F, with responses to individual peptides, Fig.\u00a0 2G,H and Figure  S1 for IFN-\u03b3 and Figure  S2A with S2B-H for 4-1BB) confirming that the T-cell activation potential of individual peptides could be masked, when present as a part of a larger peptide pool.\n Multiple studies have reported pre-existing T-cell immunity in unexposed donors using spike peptide pools and attributed the response to T-cells recognizing epitopes from common cold-causing coronaviruses to which a large section of the global population is exposed  12, 13, 15. Homology analysis of the selected epitopes (see \u201c Methods\u201d) indicated that 6 out of the 11 peptides share\u2009&gt;\u200967% sequence identity with SARS-CoV and only 1 (Peptide-11) out of the 11 peptides has over 70% identity with multiple coronaviruses (Table  3). Peptide-11 is in the S2 domain of the spike protein and showed\u2009\u2265\u20091% CD8 T-cell response at 48\u00a0h in 1 out of 7 donors tested (D167, Fig.\u00a0 2G). However, peptides 3, 6, 7, and 9 lacking significant identity to other coronaviruses (Table  3) showed\u2009\u2265\u20091% CD8 T-cell activation at 48\u00a0h in at least one donor out of 7 (Fig.\u00a0 2G,H and Figure  S1). Peptide-7 induced high CD8 T-cell activation at 48\u00a0h in two donors (D089 and D225 (Fig.\u00a0 2F and Figure  S1E). Taken together, the data suggest that pre-existing T-cell immunity to these peptides may be derived from cross-reactive TCRs recognizing other viruses.\n   To identify CDR3s amplified by individual peptides, or the All-peptide-mix, bulk TCR analysis was performed on antigen-stimulated PBMCs from donors D089 and D225 at days 7, 14, and 21 post-stimulation with antigens (see \u201c Methods\u201d). Both donors showed a robust IFN-\u03b3 response to Pep-7, and the Pep-Mix, but not to Pep-1 (Figure  S4). Diversity and clonal amplification of unique public and private CDR3s were analyzed at three different time points (Fig.\u00a0 3A,B). Both the donors showed clonal expansion of multiple public CDR3s recognizing HCMV, human herpes virus-5 (HHV-5), and Influenza-A peptides when stimulated with Pep-7 and All-peptide mix, but not with Pep-1 (Table  S2). HCMV and HHV-5 CDR3s were expanded in donor D089 (Fig.\u00a0 3A, top panel), whereas D225 showed expansion of HCMV and Influenza-A CDR3s (Fig.\u00a0 3A, bottom panel). Significantly, these CDR3s were not amplified by Spike-S1 and S2 peptide pools or by Pep-1, the latter failed to activate T-cells in these donors. Further, CDR3s recognizing HCMV peptide NLVPMVATV in donors 089 and 225 were different, suggesting that the same antigen engages multiple cross-reactive TCRs in different donors. Next, we analyzed private CDR3s in these two donors to identify novel SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific CDR3 (Fig.\u00a0 3B). Donor 089 showed a lack of specific amplification of private CDR3s suggesting that the robust CD8 T-cell response detected in this donor may be contributed by the amplified public CDR3s (Fig.\u00a0 3B, top panel). In contrast, two private CDR3s were clonally amplified by Pep-7 and All-peptide mix in D225 suggesting that the T-cell response is derived from both public and non-public TCRs in this donor (Fig.\u00a0 3B, bottom panel). Given that the TCR analysis was performed on day-7 and beyond, the amplified CDR3s may be derived from both pre-existing and na\u00efve T-cells. A list of clonally amplified public and private CDR3s detected in the two donors is given in Table  S2.\n Bulk TCR repertoire analysis after in unexposed donors following in vitro stimulation of PBMCs at different time points with the indicated peptides. ( A) Expanded public CDR3-\u03b2s recognizing shared antigens in the D089 (upper panel) and D225 (lower panel). ( B) Expanded private CDR3-\u03b2s in D089 (upper panel) and D225 (lower panel). ( C) V\u2013J gene usage in D225. ( D) V\u2013J gene usage in D089.\n To further investigate the TCR repertoire profile of donors 089 and 225 we analyzed the VDJ gene usage in the bulk CDR3 data. In D225, two V segments TRVB2 and TRVB30, and a J gene TRBJ2-1 were significantly over-represented in Pep7 and Peptide-mix treated samples (Fig.\u00a0 3C), whereas in D089 TRBV12-4 and TRBJ1-2 genes were amplified (Fig.\u00a0 3D).\n  To characterize the phenotype and functional state of activated T-cells and reveal differences between the different treatments, we performed single-cell sequencing on a 10X platform. Single-cell transcriptomics and TCR data obtained from 3500\u20134500 cells identified 3000\u20133500 unique transcripts (see \u201c Methods\u201d). Using graph-based clustering of uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) we captured transcriptomes of 4 distinct cell types (Fig.\u00a0 4A and Table  S3). Our assay method is enriched for the growth and proliferation of T-cells causing depletion of other immune cell types present in PBMC in a 14-day culture. Three cell types, CD8, \u03b3/\u03b4, and NK-T were detected in all the samples. Compared to DMSO and Pep-7 in which the CD8 T-cell fraction was\u2009~\u200960%, in spike-S1 and spike-S2 the CD8 T-cell fraction was 50% and 38% respectively. Conversely, the CD4 cluster was expanded in spike-S\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-26 14:26:41", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

parent company of an online marketplace for sneakerheads, said it has raised $195 million through private investors to continue its push into international markets.\n  The latest funding round values the company at $3.7 billion, more than double its valuation when the company  raised $100 million in September.\n  The company also provided detail about its financial performance, saying $2 billion of merchandise was sold on its Goat platform over the past year. Sales of sneakers during the period doubled compared with the previous year.\n  Do you buy sneakers or apparel from Goat? If so, how have your buying habits changed over the past year? Join the conversation below.\n  Goat remains best known as a platform to buy popular or hard-to-find sneakers, and much of its success can be traced to the continued  ascendancy of sneaker and streetwear culture. Wealthy shoppers have proved willing to shell out far more than the retail price of popular styles and colorways, fueling a competitive and controversial market for buying and flipping shoes.\n    The sneaker and streetwear resale market in North America hit more than $2 billion last year, according to Cowen, which estimates that the global market could reach $30 billion by 2030.\n  Unlike competitors such as StockX LLC and  eBay    EBAY  2.00%  which  are exclusively resell platforms, Goat also sells directly from its more than 350 brand partners, including Gucci, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen.\n  In 2019, the company began expanding beyond sneakers into luxury apparel and accessories. Eddy Lu, Goat Group\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview that the retailer has been careful about adding new categories to ensure the marketplace remains in line with the desires of its young customer base.\n  \u201cWe care about authenticity, and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t create all of these verticals,\u201d Mr. Lu said. \u201cWe have a point of view on fashion, culture and style.\u201d\n  The Goat customer base is young, fashionable and comfortable wearing expensive items alongside their secondhand purchases, Mr. Lu said. Of Goat\u2019s 30 million customers, 80% are millennials and Gen Zers.\n    For fashion labels concerned about preserving brand integrity, the Goat marketplace offers access to those shoppers on a more curated platform, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not selling their products next to  Nvidia graphics cards and batteries and things like that,\u201d Mr. Lu said.\n  International markets remain a primary target for growth, Mr. Lu said. Part of the proceeds from the latest funding round will be used to open four additional fulfillment centers this year. Three of those centers will be located in Asia, adding to three existing international facilities.

Using a data structure called a Quadtree, we will produce harmonious grids based on random numbers, source images, user input, and more.\n The chaotic, yet perfectly aligned world of generative grids is waiting for us \u2014 let\u2019s go!\n Note: I picked up this technique from one of my all-time favorite design agencies,  Pentagram. In their branding work for  Graphcore, they use Quadtrees extensively to generate random yet visually coherent patterns. The output is stunning and is a fantastic example of what you can create with this method.  You can check out a case study of the work here!\n  First things first, let\u2019s go over exactly  what we are cooking up in this tutorial. Here\u2019s an animated example of a generative Quadtree grid in action:\n   Add some  { x, y } points to a 2D space. In this example, the point\u2019s positions are random but biased towards a focal point.\n   Use the resulting grid areas to position stuff! In the example above, I am using squares and circles to form a simple pattern.\n  By experimenting with creative ways to position the points, we can create some  super interesting grid layouts. This example uses biased random numbers, but what if, for example \u2014 the points came from the brightness values of an image?\n We could pass in a picture of a Fibonacci spiral, a circle, a square, whatever, and have our points generate based on its pixel values. The possibilities are endless! Any method for positioning objects in a 2D space will work.  The weirder, the better.\n  The subdividing magic we see here is all handled by a data structure called a  Quadtree. I like to think of Quadtrees as little containers. Once the Quadtree fills with a certain number of objects, it splits itself into four more Quadtrees. Once those Quadtrees fill up, they divide themselves again, and so on.\n Quadtrees can be tricky to visualize, so here is an interactive example \u2014 click to add objects/points and observe how the Quadtree subdivides. In this example, the maximum number of items a Quadtree can contain is  four.\n  Very satisfying indeed\u2026 this is everything we need to know about Quadtrees for this tutorial, but if you would like to learn more about how they work/how you can use them,  check out this video by Dan Shiffman.\n  Although anyone is, of course, welcome to follow along \u2014 this tutorial is perfect for folks comfortable with JavaScript and  familiar with SVG/HTML Canvas.\n   To keep things simple and let us focus on the fun stuff \u2014 I have added a handy  createQtGrid function to my  generative-utils repo. This function takes an array of points and returns a ready-to-use Quadtree grid. If you would like to dive into the source code, it is  available in this repository.\n I have also created a  starter CodePen that you can  fork to get started. This pen has all of the JS imports/basic CSS you need for the upcoming examples. As always, though, you are welcome to follow along in any environment you like.\n  To start, let\u2019s create a Quadtree grid with a biased random distribution of points. Biased random numbers work great here, as they provide a strong visual focus. Pure randomness, ironically, tends to look  a little boring for Quadtree grids. The grid areas look too uniform, as the points are scattered all over the 2D space.\n In this example, we will use an SVG element to render our grid areas. Let\u2019s start by defining a  width and  height property for the SVG\u2019s viewBox:\n  Next, let\u2019s create a new  &lt;svg&gt; element to render our grid. For this, we are going to use  svg.js \u2014 a JavaScript library that greatly simplifies dynamic SVG scripting.  You can read a little more about svg.js in my  Generative SVG Starter Kit.\n  Now that we have our SVG element, we can generate some biased random points. To do so, we can make use of the  randomBias function. This function returns a random number based on four arguments:\n Bias - any number between the minimum and maximum number, this is the \u201cfocus point\u201d\n Influence - A number between 0 - 1, this argument determines how close the returned number is likely to be to the bias.\n Let\u2019s pop some code in to generate 100 random points, with a focus towards the center of the viewBox, and use svg.js to render them:\n const points  =  [ ... Array ( 100 ) ] . map ( ( )  =&gt;  {   return  {  x :  randomBias ( 0 , width , width  /  2 ,  1 ) ,  y :  randomBias ( 0 , height , height  /  2 ,  1 ) ,  width :  1 ,  height :  1 ,   } ;  } ) ;  points . forEach ( ( point )  =&gt;  {  svg . circle ( 2 ) . cx (point .x ) . cy (point .y ) ;  } ) ;\n    This point distribution looks lovely, but we should update the code so that the focus point can vary a little. Let\u2019s make that happen:\n const focus  =  {  x :  random ( 0 , width ) ,  y :  random ( 0 , height ) ,  } ;   const points  =  [ ... Array ( 100 ) ] . map ( ( )  =&gt;  {   return  {  x :  randomBias ( 0 , width , focus .x ,  1 ) ,  y :  randomBias ( 0 , height , focus .y ,  1 ) ,  width :  1 ,  height :  1 ,   } ;  } ) ;\n In this snippet, we use the  random function to generate a random  { x, y } focus point on the grid. Once the code is updated, you should see something like this:\n  Perfect! This focused-yet-random distribution is going to look great for Quadtree grids. Let\u2019s create one:\n  In this snippet, we call  createQtGrid with a width value, a height value, a level limit, and the points we generated just now. We also pass in a  gap property to give the grid areas a little breathing room.\n The level limit (controlled by  maxQtLevels) defines how many times the Quadtree can subdivide. A higher value, paired with a higher number of points, will result in a more detailed grid.\n If you  console.log(grid) now, you should see an object with a few different properties \u2014 at this point, though, we are only interested in the grid areas. Let\u2019s iterate over these and render an SVG  &lt;rect&gt; for each one:\n    Excellent. That\u2019s it! We have successfully generated a beautiful generative grid, ready to be filled with anything you like. As a simple example, here\u2019s how we could add a circle to a random selection of the grid areas:\n  Hey, that\u2019s some pretty cool generative art! All in just a few lines of code, too. We are all done with this demo now, but as a next step, I suggest having a play with the number of points, maximum subdivision amount ( maxQtLevels), and the point distribution logic \u2014 see what you can create!\n  Next up on the generative Quadtree menu are some delicious image-based grids. For this example, we will be using the pixel values of image files to determine our underlying points.\n To get set up, we can re-use the SVG element and width/height variables defined in the last demo. Either comment out the previous point generation/render code or fork the pen and create a fresh canvas. Your call!\n Ok, all set? Let\u2019s find a suitable image. For our demo, a simple picture comprised of only entirely black or white pixels is perfect. The basic outline of a shape  (a circle, square, spiral) is ideal. Think something like this:\n  If you don\u2019t fancy whipping up any custom images, here are some I made earlier.  *Removes pre-made shapes from the weird digital oven\u2026*\n  These images are all  192x192px in size, matching the width/height attributes of the example SVG viewBox and Quadtree grid. The image examples are formatted this way to save on having to do any funky calculation. You don\u2019t have to work to this resolution, but try and make sure your image dimensions match the width/height dimensions defined in your code.\n Note: although these source images are quite small, the end result will scale to any size.\n Once you have chosen your image, pop back into the code and create a new  canvas element, setting its width and height to that of your SVG viewBox/grid and storing its  context in a new variable. We will use this canvas in a moment to render our image and extract its pixel data.\n    Once the image has loaded, we render it to our canvas, define a new  points array, and loop through all of the canvas\u2019s pixels. If a pixel has a red, green, and blue value of 0  (a black pixel), we store its coordinates in the points array \u2014 this is why we are using images comprised of only black or white pixels.\n Note: You could expand this code to handle full color images, but we are keeping things simple for the demo.\n To get some visual feedback on what is happening here, let\u2019s also render an SVG  circle at each of these points:\n img . onload  =  ( )  =&gt;  {  ctx . drawImage (img ,  0 ,  0 ) ;    const points  =  [ ] ;    for  ( let x  =  0 ; x  &lt; width ; x ++ )  {   for  ( let y  =  0 ; y  &lt; height ; y ++ )  {   const  { data  }  = ctx . getImageData (x , y ,  1 ,  1 ) ;   if  (data [ 0 ]  + data [ 1 ]  + data [ 2 ]  ===  0 )  {  points . push ( { x , y , width :  1 , height :  1  } ) ;   svg . circle ( 1 ) . cx (x ) . cy (y ) ;   }   }   }  } ;\n   Hey, look at that! It\u2019s the original image turned into  { x, y } points. Perfect. Let\u2019s pass these points to our  createQtGrid function, just like before. This time, try setting  maxQtLevels to a slightly higher number \u2014 this should help bring out the detail in the grid:\n img . onload  =  ( )  =&gt;  {   ...    const grid  =  createQtGrid ( {  width ,  height ,  points ,  gap :  1 ,  maxQtLevels :  6   } ) ;  }\n Now, we can loop through the grid areas in the same way as demo #1, rendering an SVG rectangle at each one:\n    Beautiful! We have created a generative grid layout based on an underlying source image. In this case, that source image is a Fibonacci spiral. Very fancy indeed! Here\u2019s what this grid looks like with some circles/rectangles placed on it:\n  It\u2019s worth noting that different images will need slightly different  maxQtLevels values. Like everything in generative art, there is no single magic number. The best results come from lots of tweaking and squinting at the screen.\n  So far in our Quadtree adventure, we have exclusively used SVG to render our grids, but it seems like a bit of a shame to leave CSS grid out of the party, right?\n Well, I have some good news! The  area objects that  createQtGrid returns also have  col and  row values. Using these values, we can easily create generative CSS grid layouts \u2014 ready to use for all kinds of innovative designs.\n I won\u2019t go into too much detail here, as the process for creating CSS grid layouts is identical to that of the previous examples, but here\u2019s a CodePen showing how to use the  createQtGrid function with HTML/CSS:\n    Hey, we made it! Thank you so much for reading until the end. I know some of these concepts are a little heavy, but the techniques learned here will serve you well on your generative art adventure.\n If you make anything cool with the stuff taught in this tutorial, please let me know!

Now there are walkways allowing visitors to explore the tunnels and chambers.\n Alfonsina Russo, the director of the Colosseum, said the hypogeum, which was originally excavated in the 19th century, was the true \u201cbackstage\u201d of the amphitheatre.\n \u201cToday we are returning to the public a monument within a monument,\u201d Russo said. \u201cWhat emerged [from the project] is that the hypogeum had a 400-year-long history, from when the amphitheatre opened in AD80 to the final show in 523.\u201d\n She said the 15 restored corridors recounted \u201ctraces [of history] left over time\u201d.\n More than 80 archaeologists, architects and engineers were involved in the two-year project to \u201cbring back to the centre of attention a monument that the whole world loves\u201d, said Diego Della Valle, the chairman of Tod\u2019s.\n There was much criticism when Italy\u2019s culture minister, Dario Franceschini, announced several public-private partnerships for the renovation of Rome\u2019s monuments. The restoration of the hypogeum is the second part of a three-phase project on the Colosseum that began eight years ago and for which Tod\u2019s has paid a total of \u20ac25m (\u00a321m).\n The first phase focused on a clean-up of the Colosseum\u2019s facade, and the final part, expected to be completed in 2024, will involve restoring the galleries and lighting system as well as adding a new visitor centre.\n \u201cIt\u2019s right to have full public-private collaboration,\u201d Franceschini said. \u201cThe project is really important and demonstrates how an Italian company, which exports all over the world, then invests back in its country to protect its artistic and cultural heritage.\u201d\n Other Italian brands that have paid for the renovations of key monuments include Fendi, which restored the Trevi Fountain, and Bulgari, which restored the Spanish Steps.\n Meanwhile, a project to restore the  floor of the Colosseum to its former glory is expected to be completed in 2023. The new, hi-tech stage, which could host cultural events, will be able to quickly cover or uncover the underground networks, allowing them to be protected from the rain or to be aired out.\n In Roman times, crowds would fill the Colosseum to watch gladiators defeat animals including bears, tigers, elephants and rhinoceroses.", "posttime": "2021-06-26 13:01:32", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7f57\u9a6c,tunnels,\u6062\u590d", "title": "\u7f57\u9a6c\u7684\u5730\u4e0b\u96a7\u9053\u5b8c\u5168\u5411\u516c\u4f17\u5f00\u653e ", "title_en": "Underground tunnels of Rome\u2019s Colosseum fully opened to public", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/25/underground-tunnels-of-romes-colosseum-fully-opened-to-public", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f57\u9a6c", "tunnels", "\u6062\u590d"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "51779d757729477ea50d56d7efeecdb7.jpeg", "infoid": 1068383, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u6700\u8fd1\u5728\u6211\u7684\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u79ef\u538b\u677f\u4e0a\u6253\u5f00\u4e86\u4e00\u5f20\u673a\u7968\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u7ed5\u8fc7API\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u524d\u7aef\u56e2\u961f\u4f7f\u7528\u6211\u7684\u56e2\u961f\u7684API\u5bf9Elasticsearch\u7684\u76f8\u5f53\u6c89\u91cd\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684API\u7f51\u5173\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u529f\u80fd\u662f\u7f13\u5b58\u91cd\u578b\u805a\u5408\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u301c30\u79d2\u3002\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u5076\u5c14\u4ed6\u4eec\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u5728\u301c30\u79d2\u7f13\u5b58\u7a97\u53e3\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u4e24\u4e2a\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5e76\u5e0c\u671b\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u96c6\u3002\n \u6253\u5f00\u7684\u8bf7\u6c42\u8bfb\u53d6\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u201cAPI\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u7981\u7528\u67d0\u4e9b\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u201d\u3002\u5728REST-ISH-FUL API\u5de5\u4f5c\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u5927\u7ea6\u6570\u5b66\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e9b\u7acb\u5373\u60f3\u5230\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u662f\uff1a\n  \u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b58\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u7f13\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\u8bf7\u6c42\u6307\u4ee4\u3002\n  \u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u6807\u9898\u7f13\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\uff1a\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5c11\u7684API\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u786e\u4fdd\u6211\u7684API\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e38\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u6765\u66f4\u8f7b\u677e\u5730\u4f7f\u6211\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u3002\n \u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u8981\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ea\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u4f60\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u5f53\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0d\u610f\u5473\u7740\u60a8\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5c06\u671f\u671b\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u5b83\u8fd8\u5e76\u4e0d\u610f\u5473\u7740\u60a8\u7684\u7528\u6237\u77e5\u9053\u60a8\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002\n  \u65e0\u8bba\u60a8\u8ba4\u4e3a\u60a8\u7684API\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u5426\u662f\u201c\u6807\u51c6\u201d\u6216\u201c\u9884\u671f\u201d\uff0c\u5c31\u4f1a\u5411\u60a8\u7684\u6587\u6863\u6dfb\u52a0\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5bf9\u6211\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684Readme.md\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4ee3\u7801\u6bb5\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u6240\u9700\u8981\u7684\u3002\n ##\u7f13\u5b58Businingif\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u4e0d\u5e0c\u671b\u60a8\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u8bf7\u4f7f\u7528\u7f13\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\u6807\u9898\u3002\u7f13\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\uff1a\u65e0\u5546\u5e97 \n\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u7591\u95ee\u6216\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u8bf7\u6309\u7167Twitter @Q_Vault\u6253\u51fb\u6211\u3002 \u5982\u679c\u6211\u5728\u6587\u7ae0\u4e2d\u72af\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u8bf7\u52a1\u5fc5\u8ba9\u6211\u77e5\u9053\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230\u7ea0\u6b63\uff01 ", "note_en": "I recently had a ticket opened on my team\u2019s backlog board requesting the ability to bypass our API\u2019s caching system. For context, our front-end team uses my team\u2019s API to make fairly heavy requests to ElasticSearch, and one of the features of our API gateway is to cache the results of heavy aggregations for ~30 seconds. It turns out, every once in a while they need to run two of the same query within the ~30-second caching window and want an updated result set.\n The request that was opened read something like, \u201cthe API needs a parameter to disable caching for certain queries\u201d. When working in a REST-ish-ful API there are approximately  math.MaxInt ways to accomplish that, and some of the first ones that immediately came to mind were:\n  As it turns out, there\u2019s already a standard for this sort of thing, the   Cache-Control request directives.\n  Using the standard header  Cache-Control: no-store not only makes my job easier by requiring fewer API design decisions but also ensures that my API\u2019s clients aren\u2019t surprised by a new way to accomplish a common task.\n I do want to point out, however, that just because you\u2019ve decided to use a fairly well-supported standard, doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t other standards your users will expect. It also doesn\u2019t mean that your users are aware of the existence of the standard you\u2019ve chosen.\n  Regardless of whether or not you think your API\u2019s behavior is \u201cstandard\u201d or \u201cto be expected\u201d, just add the behavior to your docs anyway. For me, the following snippet in our  Readme.md was all we needed.\n ## Cache bustingIf you don&#39;t want your query cached, use the Cache-Control header.  Cache-Control: no-store\n Follow and hit me up on Twitter  @q_vault if you have any questions or comments.

WDC-21008  Product Line:\u00a0WD My Book Live and WD My Book Live Duo  Published:\u00a0June 24, 2021\n  Western Digital has determined that some My Book Live and My Book Live Duo devices are being compromised through exploitation of a remote command execution vulnerability. In some cases, the attackers have triggered a factory reset that appears to erase all data on the device.\n We are reviewing log files which we have received from affected customers to further characterize the attack and the mechanism of access. The log files we have reviewed show that the attackers directly connected to the affected My Book Live devices from a variety of IP addresses in different countries. This indicates that the affected devices were directly accessible from the Internet, either through direct connection or through port forwarding that was enabled either manually or automatically via UPnP.\n Additionally, the log files show that on some devices, the attackers installed a trojan with a file named \u201c.nttpd,1-ppc-be-t1-z\u201d, which is a Linux ELF binary compiled for the PowerPC architecture used by the My Book Live and Live Duo. A sample of this trojan has been captured for further analysis and it has been   uploaded to VirusTotal.\n Our investigation of this incident has not uncovered any evidence that Western Digital cloud services, firmware update servers, or customer credentials were compromised. As the My Book Live devices can be directly exposed to the internet through port forwarding, the attackers may be able to discover vulnerable devices through port scanning.\n We understand that our customers\u2019 data is very important. We do not yet understand why the attacker triggered the factory reset; however, we have obtained a sample of an affected device and are investigating further. Additionally, some customers have reported that data recovery tools may be able to recover data from affected devices, and we are currently investigating the effectiveness of these tools.\n The My Book Live series was introduced to the market in 2010 and these devices received their final firmware update in 2015.\n  At this time, we recommend you disconnect your My Book Live and My Book Live Duo from the Internet to protect your data on the device.\n We have heard customer concerns that the current My Cloud OS 5 and My Cloud Home series of devices may be affected. These devices use a newer security architecture and are not affected by the vulnerabilities used in this attack. We recommend that eligible My Cloud OS 3 users   upgrade to OS 5 to continue to receive security updates for your device.", "posttime": "2021-06-26 12:19:38", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4e66\u7c4d,wd,\u8bbe\u5907", "title": "WD\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u63aa\u65bd\u4e3aWD\u6211\u7684\u4e66\u7c4d\u76f4\u64ad\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u4e66\u5b9e\u51b5\u4e8c\u4eba ", "title_en": "WD Recommended Security Measures for WD My Book Live and WD My Book Live Duo", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.westerndigital.com/support/productsecurity/wdc-21008-recommended-security-measures-wd-mybooklive-wd-mybookliveduo", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4e66\u7c4d", "wd", "\u8bbe\u5907"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d1615bb7dc31e3f074082558ea885b96.jpg", "infoid": 1068381, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters", "note_en": "Among certain philosophers it is a commonplace that dreams are radically private, that no one can follow you into them. A fragment from Heraclitus distills the problem: \u201cThe universe for those who are awake is single and common, while in sleep each person turns aside into a private universe.\u201d Hegel, commenting on this same fragment, says that \u201cthe dream is a knowledge of something of which I alone know.\u201d [1] Consider how you might teach a child to understand the meaning of the word \u201cdream.\u201d You cannot point anywhere and say, \u201cThat\u2019s a dream.\u201d Nor can you say at any moment to the child, \u201cLook, I\u2019m dreaming,\u201d and be doing it.\n The science of dreams\u2014first psychoanalysis, and then neuroscience\u2014has inherited this frame of reference. In 1900, Freud writes that dreams are \u201ccompletely asocial.\u201d A hundred years later, Yuval Nir and Giulio Tononi, two leaders in contemporary brain research, write that \u201cdreams \u2026 show that the human brain, disconnected from the environment, can generate an entire world of conscious experiences by itself.\u201d [2] Here, dreams are, by definition, that whole nocturnal life you cannot share, that  second life as Nerval wrote, with its unexpected villains and lovers, its indescribable moonscapes, its fantastical concatenations of memory, its unfathomable vehicles and dungeons, its transports of flight, and its corporeal crises when the limbs turn stiff and the monster is upon you. Dreams mean disconnection and disengagement from the framework of this our shared world, and immersion in them is so strange, so sorrowful, so disorienting, sometimes so very shameful, that we can barely coax them into the light even should we want to.\n And yet, despite this vision of dreams as paradigmatically distant, many of the world\u2019s cultures\u2014especially outside of the modern West\u2014have developed elaborate protocols by which dreams can be shared. The complexity of these protocols is confirmation, in one sense, of the claim that dreams are especially private, even more so than other forms of thinking. A society must work very hard indeed to make them sharable; they must be wrestled into this life from that nighttime one. But these protocols are also somehow a rebuke to the philosophers\u2019 skepticism: people build their own universes in dreams, except, as we\u2019ll see, they then go to great lengths to reconstruct and combine them into a shared one while awake. This seems to raise at least two questions. Why go to such great lengths to share dreams? And what happens to a culture, like our own, that doesn\u2019t practice dream sharing, that (a few isolated realms aside, perhaps the most important being psychoanalysis) has largely given up on it?\n The task of this essay is to consider what dream sharing looks like across the globe, particularly in certain small-scale societies where it has been elevated to the level of an art form (or, perhaps, beyond it). In dream sharing, something from the depths of sleep is harnessed for use in the public world, in the community of the awoken. For many cultures, as we\u2019ll see, dream sharing is a protocol for regular renegotiation of what might be termed the  social contract of sensuous imagining, the set of images and emotions and unseen realities that govern, even more than abstract ideas, \u2028an individual\u2019s relationship to society and to \u2028the cosmos.\n In the most familiar cases, dream-sharing protocols involve recounting the dream, and then asking someone to interpret it.  I dreamt of gathering wheat under a full moon. Interpretation: you will be married within the year. It\u2019s a process that people in our own culture still practice, both on the analyst\u2019s couch and at the kitchen table\u2014though in the wrong company telling a dream might get you dismissed as boring, and interpreting one might get you mocked for being superstitious.\n Historically, traditions of great intellectual subtlety have developed to interpret dreams, and to consider what interpreting a dream actually means. In the Palestinian Talmud, for instance, it\u2019s made quite clear that when it comes to prophetic dreams, what causes the fulfillment of a prophecy is not the dream itself (or its originator, God), but rather the  interpretation of the dream. If a rabbi interprets a dream as foretelling the death of the dreamer and then the dreamer dies, then it\u2019s the  rabbi\u2019s fault that he\u2019s died. [3] Similarly, Cicero writes that the dream-obsessed people of Telmessos blamed the interpreters, and not the dreamer, if a dream prediction turned out to be false; it wasn\u2019t the dream itself that was wrong\u2014such a phrase would have made no sense to the dreamers of Telmessos\u2014it was the interpretation that had failed. [4] Already in these instances some unexpected epistemological principles are being entertained. A dream and its interpretation do not follow one another directly in the way of a question and its answer. Each has its own life, its own path of causation, its own relationship to the truth. These overlap in places, and separate decisively in others. In some cases, the interpretation even overwhelms and redirects the dream.\n But this is only the beginning, for there are many cultures where recounting and interpreting is not the paradigm for dream sharing at all. Instead, dreams are understood to be sites of action; not texts but places, not a coded language but a part of reality. Often they connect individuals to cosmologies that bend space and time in ways closer to Einstein than Newton. The experienced reality of the dream\u2014not its purported meaning, but its spaces, timescales, transformations, felt experience\u2014is what\u2019s evoked, what\u2019s brought into the public realm of waking life, and what\u2019s made use of. It may be that a key task\u2014hunting, for example\u2014is accomplished in dreams before it can be accomplished in waking life. Or it may be, as among the Wayuu of Colombia and Venezuela, that the trajectory of a dream is altered by being retold in waking life, with the expectation that the next night, the dream itself will change, and, as a result, the person\u2019s waking life will too. [5] (A similar technique has been pioneered by the therapist Barry Krakow to work with trauma victims: by writing down in a journal happier endings to their recurrent nightmares, the patients could tame them \u2028in sleep.) [6]\n Among many Aboriginal peoples of Australia, dreams are understood to be important conduits into a metaphysical system often called in English the Dreamtime (though it is important to note that despite this nomenclature, the concept\u2019s exact relation to sleep dreams varies considerably among different Aboriginal traditions, and is a matter of some scholarly debate). [7] The Dreamtime, or Dreaming, is the heroic myth-world, and also the realm of laws, traditions, ideals. Aboriginal philosophy is subtle and sophisticated, in all likelihood ungraspable to the uninitiated; furthermore, the generalizations of anthropologists inevitably fail to capture the reality of a community in which myths and songs and ideas are created, negotiated, and modified by individuals, each with a distinctive cast of mind, some of them especially prodigious and brilliant dreamers. But we can trace some lineaments of this intellectual world, keeping in mind that they (and other traditions described in this essay) relate to individual practice the way a broad history of the novel might relate to the specific complexity of Proust or Dickens.\n   The Dreaming is both the primal world, the Creation, and also a world that continues to exist all around us, its separateness from everyday life a matter of temporary perspective rather than intractable fact. In many Australian cultures, dreams provide an essential point of connection. Conception occurs when a soul crosses over from one realm to the other in dreams; death doesn\u2019t truly occur until a person is sighted one last time in a dream; dreams produce insights about where to hunt, or they answer a question about lineage; sometimes they give birth to new songs and new rituals; they often provide a stage on which dreamers can glimpse the eternal and world-creating movements of their individual ancestors, whose inner essence their own bodies contain. The anthropologist Sylvie Poirier reports that among the Pintupi of the Western Desert, the dream-world and the waking world have to be regularly realigned with one another. She writes that once she was riding with a family in a car that broke down in the desert. The car got fixed, but for it to  really be fixed, it needed to be working again in the dream-world as well as the waking one. \u201cAs the engine started running again,\u201d Poirier recalls, \u201ca young woman pointed at her toddler and said, \u2018Might be that boy had a dream about that car and saw it working properly.\u2019\u201d [8]\n It would be a discredit to the Pintupi to say that for them, dreams are  merely prophetic. For the thing the dream predicts has already happened. Rather, the events of dreams and the events of waking life are required to be somehow in accord. And, what\u2019s more, if the boy did actually dream of the car working, then when it starts working, his family members have accomplished the very thing that Heraclitus and Hegel cannot accept: they\u2019ve  seen his dream, they can say \u201che is dreaming of a car working\u201d and also see a car working, and can understand these two phenomena as one and the same.\n In this society, where a boy must dream of a car working for the car to work, there is little that resembles what we might call dream interpretation. Sylvie Poirier, again: \u201cWhat possibly might be seen, at first, as a lack of interest in dream interpretation reveals, on closer examination, another local reality\u2014the paramount role of the action of dreaming itself in one\u2019s life itinerary and in the unfolding of reality.\u201d [9] Dream life and waking life do not exist in a hermeneutic relation to one another\u2014instead, they are interpenetrable and complementary planes of existence. Acting in one has an effect in the other\u2014which in turn has an effect again in the first, and on and on in a continuous cycle.\n Robin Ridington has shown, in a series of magnificent books and essays, how a Den\u00e9 people of the Canadian interior, the Dane-zaa (or Dunne-za), use dreaming to give shape to the substance and structure of their lives. Building on years of work with Dane-zaa Dreamer Charlie Yahey and other tradition-bearers, Ridington writes, \u201cCamps among the Dunne-za were always set up so that there was bush unbroken by human trails in the direction of the rising sun. People slept with their heads in this direction and received images in their dreams. These dream images were believed to have come down to them along the path of the sun. In order to cross trails with an animal in the bush, the hunter had first to make contact with the sun\u2019s path across the sky.\u201d [10] Animals had to be taken (or give themselves up) in dreams before they could be killed in waking life; indeed, the real hunt took place in dreams, and the waking hunt was only its fulfillment or realization. The details constituting this system of dream-knowing were in every instance intimately tied to the practical skills required to survive on the ecological knife-edge that is the boreal forest. (\u201cThat\u2019s hungry country up there,\u201d an ethnobotanist once told me, \u201cless food than the Kalahari.\u201d) For example, just as hunters had to receive dreams along the path of the sun, so in waking life they relied on the sun for orientation amid the vast expanses of taiga. To improve his status, a hunter not only needed to give gifts and perform feats; he needed to defeat his rivals in dream battles. [11]\n   For the Dane-zaa, as for many such dream-sharing cultures, the mixing of dreams and waking life occurred already at the very headwaters of history. In the mythtime, a boy is abandoned by his father on an island, and survives because he makes contact with his medicine animals in dreams. They teach him how to hunt in the remote place where he\u2019s been left to die. He then defeats his father and returns from the island to subdue the giant animals who once roamed the earth eating humans. He acquires the name Ts\u00e1\u00e1yaa and becomes a culture hero, sending the animals underground so that their subterranean bodies become the breathing, slumbering contours of the landscape. The remaining animals are smaller, and humans can hunt them, inaugurating a new era. In this new time, Ts\u00e1\u00e1yaa\u2019s actions have made it possible for humans to become the hunters rather than the hunted. In fact, his dreams become the template for making contact through visions with the sleeping animal giants, and enlisting their aid in the hunt of their smaller kin.\n A nomadic culture cannot afford to express itself in huge numbers of material artifacts. But a system of dreams and visions, a network of images, a world-picture mapping and ordering the perceivable world, imparted through language, retained in the imagination\u2014this can be carried easily, with no added burden to the back (though presumably the weight on mind and memory is prodigious and requires great training to bear). For a nomadic community, a cosmology and its dream manifestations are as a portable Chartres, a weightless Louvre, a repository of knowledge, history, and advice, of injunctions to change your life or keep it as it is, all expressed in sensuous, globalizing form. This vast place is entered every night and taken along every morning in the mind, and it is both an image of possibility and a theater of action. To dream of giant animals who help you hunt their shrunken descendants changes, profoundly, your relationship to the animals you see in waking life. So, too, failure to capture an animal might force a transformation in your relationship\u2014your allegiances, your supplications\u2014to the giant animals of your dreams. \u201cThe true art of these people,\u201d Ridington writes, \u201cwas their relationship to the world itself\u201d\u2014though perhaps  art is a pale analogy for a still more consequential form of representation, one that is simultaneously a world-picture and a decisive and causative component within the world itself. [12]\n And here we are ushered into the central mystery of dream sharing, the key to its being at once an avenue into the numinous and a mechanism of the law: the world-picture that is also the world. We have been habituated to a tradition that considers dreams to be essentially texts awaiting decipherment. [13] But in the examples above, on the contrary, dreams are treated as fully four-dimensional, as complete sensual realities in which the dreamer lives just as she lives in a four-dimensional, sensual reality while awake. In this lived reality of dreams, however, two paradoxical qualities are foregrounded in a way that they are not in waking existence. On the one hand, dreams appear extraordinarily pliable when seen from the outside, as for example what is described in the Upanishads: \u201cThis is how he dreams. He takes materials from the entire world, and taking them apart on his own and then on his own putting them back together, he dreams with his own radiance, his own light.\u201d On the other, seen from the inside, once the dreamer is in the dream, there is almost no escape, no agency, as in this description given by Isaac Tens, a Tsimshian shaman, who faints in the woods after seeing a giant owl fly down and grab hold of him: \u201cI dreamed that I was now flying way up into the Sky, and here I saw a great many strange things. And I knew that it was the owl which was flying me up by grasping my head. Then I suddenly awoke \u2026 When I returned to the house of my father, I told him what had happened to me. So he said to me, \u2018The reason this has happened to you, is that you will be a great Shaman Halait.\u2019\u201d [14]\n These qualities seem to hold true across all human dreaming, though it is in the thinking of dream-sharing societies that they tend to achieve their fullest description. What is the purpose of such precise reflection on the nature and content of dreaming? To talk about dreams in waking life is to talk about the state of mind in which the world-picture we have internalized (and even in some sense authored) has absolute power over us. Make no mistake: such a state of mind is not limited to dreams. How often in our waking lives does our capacity for distanced reflection disappear, our self-consciousness vanish in the face of fear, reflex, desire, engrossment? But immersion in the world-picture is elusive in waking life, pitching in and out, furtive precisely because we cannot achieve any distance from it when we experience it. Dreams, on the other hand, are a discrete manifestation of the world the imagination generates, sealed off by the envelope of sleep, and (at least sometimes) available to the memory afterward. (And let it be clear that  imagination is not meant here as a denigrating word, equivalent to  fiction or  superstition, but rather to describe those sensual forms\u2014images, sounds, feelings\u2014not perceived by the bodily senses). Dreams are instances where the imagination unfurls its full power over us, its capacity to situate us within an entire cosmos. Dreams show how the imagination mediates between perception and action, how it takes our experience of reality and directly transmutes it into a set of possible feelings, desires, and behaviors. And dreams are instances in which these powers of the imagination can be later contemplated, while waking, at a distance. To discuss dreams, tweak them, act them out, try to alter them and manipulate them in waking life\u2014this is an attempt to achieve distance from the imagination\u2019s world-picture so as to study and refine it.\n What is essential to understand is that this is not merely a question of ideology. The culture of modern universities, in which I was trained, has many extremely sophisticated vocabularies for discussing abstractions and their relationship to experience. But we are, in contrast, poor in any praxis that might help negotiate the relationship between the patterns of sensual cognition (images, figures, sounds, memories) and the perceptual, material world in which, while awake, we all act. For these sensuous forms of thought often feed directly into action or reaction, affect and emotion, bypassing entirely the abstract vocabulary by which we might describe their substructures. (Someone can have written a dissertation on structural racism and still find himself afraid of a Black man walking behind him on the street.) Dreams have historically been one place where such praxes have been developed, where the world-picture can be contemplated discretely, and modified when needed.\n One of the most explicit\u2014and most beautiful\u2014examples that I know by which dreams are socialized into waking life belonged until recently to the Ongees of the Andaman Islands. Vishvajit Pandya worked in the 1980s among these members of one of the last hunter-gatherer cultures in the Bay of Bengal. [15] Pandya explains that before going to bed, the Ongees narrated to one another their dreams from the night before, and their experiences of the day that had just ended, especially their time spent in the forest hunting and gathering food. But in doing so, they would  negotiate the content of their dreams, modifying it so that everyone\u2019s dream accounts might be gradually aligned with one another. One person might report having dreamt of fishing on the south beach of the island, another picking nuts on the west beach, then the first might suggest a compromise:  We both went fishing in our dreams, but on the west beach.\n The indigenous explanation for this extraordinary process, Pandya reports, is as follows. During dreaming, the inner self leaves the outer self (the body) and travels the island in order to recuperate the bits of being that a person has lost during the day. These bits of being are most commonly manifest as stray smells, marooned on bushes and trees by the body during its daytime passage around the island. As the inner self collects these smells in the d\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-26 11:37:50", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

", "note_en": "Investing in cryptocurrency means taking on risks, but getting scammed shouldn\u2019t be one of them. Reports to the FTC\u2019s Consumer Sentinel  1 suggest scammers are cashing in on the buzz around cryptocurrency and luring people into bogus investment opportunities in record numbers. Since October 2020, reports have skyrocketed, with nearly 7,000 people reporting losses of more than $80 million on these scams.  2 Their reported median loss? $1,900. Compared to the same period a year earlier, that\u2019s about twelve times the number of reports and nearly 1,000% more in reported losses.  3\n Some say there\u2019s a Wild West vibe to the crypto culture, and an element of mystery too. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts congregate online to chat about their shared passion. And with bitcoin\u2019s value soaring in recent months, new investors may be eager  to get in on the action. All of this plays right into the hands of scammers. They blend into the scene with claims that can seem plausible because cryptocurrency is unknown territory for many people. Online, people may appear to be friendly and willing to share their \u201ctips.\u201d But that can also be part of the ruse to get people to invest in their scheme. In fact, some of these schemes are based on referral chains, and work by bringing in people who then recruit new \u201cinvestors.\u201d\n Many people have reported being lured to websites that look like opportunities for investing in or mining cryptocurrencies, but are bogus. They often offer several investment tiers \u2013 the more you put in, the bigger the supposed return. Sites use fake testimonials and cryptocurrency jargon to appear credible, but promises of enormous, guaranteed returns are simply lies. These websites may even make it look like your investment is growing. But people report that, when they try to withdraw supposed profits, they are told to send even more crypto \u2013 and end up getting nothing back.\n Then, there are \u201cgiveaway scams,\u201d supposedly sponsored by celebrities or other known figures in the cryptocurrency space, that promise to immediately multiply the cryptocurrency you send. But, people report that they discovered later that they\u2019d simply sent their crypto directly to a scammer\u2019s wallet. For example, people have reported sending more than $2 million in cryptocurrency to Elon Musk impersonators over just the past six months.\n Scammers even use online dating to draw people into cryptocurrency investment scams. Many people have reported believing they were in a long-distance relationship when their new love started chatting about a hot cryptocurrency opportunity, which they then acted on. About 20% of the money people reported losing through romance scams since October 2020 was sent in cryptocurrency, and many of these reports were from people who said they thought they were investing.  4\n Since October 2020, people ages 20 to 49 were over five times more likely to report losing money on cryptocurrency investment scams than older age groups.  5 The numbers are especially striking for people in their 20s and 30s: this group reported losing far more money on investment scams than on any other type of fraud,  6 and more than half of their reported investment scam losses were in cryptocurrency.  7 In contrast, people 50 and older were far less likely to report losing money on cryptocurrency investment scams. But when this group did lose money on these scams, their reported individual losses were higher, with a median reported loss of $3,250.\n To be clear, while investment scams top the list as the most lucrative way to obtain cryptocurrency, scammers will use whatever story works to get people to send crypto. That often involves impersonating a government authority or a well-known business. For example, many people have told the FTC they loaded cash into Bitcoin ATM machines to pay imposters claiming to be from the Social Security Administration. Others reported losing money to scammers posing as Coinbase, a well-known cryptocurrency exchange. In fact, 14% of reported losses to imposters of all types are now in cryptocurrency.  8\n Here are some things to know to play it safe(er) when it comes to cryptocurrency:\n Promises of guaranteed huge returns or claims that your cryptocurrency will be multiplied are always scams.\n  The cryptocurrency itself  is the investment. You make money if you\u2019re lucky enough to sell it for more than you paid. Period. Don\u2019t trust people who say they know a better way.\n  If a caller, love interest, organization, or anyone else insists on cryptocurrency, you can bet it\u2019s a scam.\n To learn more about cryptocurrency scams, visit  ftc.gov/cryptocurrency.

Children under 16, most of whom haven\u2019t been vaccinated, accounted for about half of those infected, he said.\n  The government this week expanded its vaccination campaign to include all 12- to 15-year-olds after a jump in infections among schoolchildren in a town in central Israel. It has since quickly spread geographically and to other groups of the population.\n  The number of cases in Israel is relatively low by global standards. But new cases of Covid-19 rose to over 200 on Thursday from around 10 a day for most of June.\n  Israel is now reassessing its Covid-19 regulations after moving to open up its society and economy following multiple lockdowns last year.\n  You will be charged $  + tax (if applicable) for The Wall Street Journal.
