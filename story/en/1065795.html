There was also a bag of rosin, a ubiquitous sight on major-league mounds.</p><p> 在胶合板上的胶合板上是松焦油的容器;牛油罐的牛蛙防晒罐和爬行力牢固;在一个叫做蜘蛛大头钉的浅圆形容器中，一种超级粘性粘贴，用于帮助握把地图集在强大的竞争中。还有一袋松香，一个普遍的联赛土墩普遍存在。</p><p> While rosin is legal, when mixed with BullFrog or pine tar, it&#39;s said to create a performance edge. They are the kind of substances commonly found near major-league dugouts and in bullpen bags, according to sources familiar with such practices. They make their way to the pitchers&#39; ball caps, gloves, and belts, and ultimately their fingertips. For Major League Baseball, foreign substances are becoming more of a problem.</p><p> 虽然松香是合法的，但与牛蛙或松油混合时，它＆＃39;他说创建一个性能优势。据熟悉此类实践的来源，它们是主要联赛防空店和牛栏袋附近的物质。他们向投手和＃39做了路。球帽，手套和皮带，最终他们的指尖。对于主要的联赛棒球，外国物质正变得越来越有问题。</p><p>  After umpire Joe West confiscated St. Louis pitcher Giovanny Gallegos&#39; ball cap due to a visible stain last week, Cardinals manager Mike Shildt ranted to reporters about MLB&#39;s policing of foreign substances. Shildt called sticky stuff baseball&#39;s &#34; dirty little secret.&#34; He called out some of the secrets by name.</p><p>  umpire joe west没收圣路易斯投手giovanny gallegos＆＃39;由于上周可见的染色球帽，Cardinals Manager Mike Shildt咆哮着报告者关于MLB＆＃39;对外国物质的警务进行警察。 Scildt称粘性东西棒球＆＃39; s＆＃34;肮脏的小秘密。＆＃34;他按名字拨出了一些秘密。</p><p>  &#34;You want to police some sunscreen and rosin? Go ahead. Get every single person in this league,&#34; Shildt said. &#34;Why don&#39;t you start with the guys that are cheating with some stuff that&#39;s really impacting the game? … Let&#39;s go check the guys that are sitting there going to their gloves everyday with filthy stuff coming out.&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;你想警察一些防晒霜和松香吗？前进。让每个人在这个联盟中，＆＃34; Shildt说。 ＆＃34;为什么不要与欺骗某些东西的家伙开始＆＃39;真正影响游戏的人？ ......让我们去检查那些坐在一起的手套，肮脏的东西出来。＆＃34;</p><p> I was here in Pittsburgh a few days before the Cardinals&#39; kerfuffle to experiment and understand more about baseball&#39;s sticky situation. I was curious to see how different kinds of substances helped performance. Helping me with the research were two college arms in the transfer portal: Tom Colcombe, most recently of the University of Pittsburgh, and Spencer Curran from Seton Hill University, which is in nearby Greensburg, Pennsylvania.</p><p> 在红衣主教＆＃39前几天，我在匹兹堡; Kerfuffle实验并了解有关棒球的更多信息＆＃39; S粘性情况。我很想看看不同类型的物质有助于表现。帮助我的研究是转让门户网站的两座大学武器：毕茨堡大学的汤姆Colcombe，以及来自塞曼山大学的斯宾塞·柯兰斯，在宾夕法尼亚州附近的Greensburg。 </p><p>   I dipped my right index finger into the container and the substance immediately took hold. As I slowly moved my hand away from the jar, the Spider Tack refused to let go. A long band stretched from the jar to my index finger, like bubble gum stuck to the sole of a shoe.</p><p>我将我的正确食指浸入容器中，物质立即抓住。当我慢慢地向罐子移动了我的手，蜘蛛钉拒绝放手。从罐子伸展到我的食指中的长带，就像泡泡糖粘在鞋子上。</p><p>  I worked an eraser head&#39;s worth of Spider Tack into my right thumb, index, and middle fingers until it felt absorbed. I reached for a ball out of a five-gallon bucket and stepped to the homemade pitching mound. My fingers were now flypaper.</p><p>  我曾经拍过了一个橡皮擦头＆＃39;蜘蛛钉进入我的右手拇指，指数和中指，直到它感到被吸收。我从五加仑桶中伸出球，踩到自制的倾斜土墩。我的手指现在是空的。</p><p> &#34;He&#39;s got 60 (mph) in him,&#34; hollered Matthew Pilewski in a half-encouraging, half-kidding manner, noting my pathetic velocity. Pilewski runs the place.</p><p> ＆＃34;他在他身上有60（英里/小时），＆＃34; HOLLERED MATTHEW PILWSKI以半令人鼓舞的半开玩笑的方式，注意到我的可怜速度。 piplwski运行这个地方。</p><p> I dug my right foot in against the rubber, raised my left leg,  tried to keep my arm stroke short, and moved forward, throwing as hard as I could. The ball sailed close enough to the strike zone to register on the Rapsodo tracking device near the plate that measures various spin and velocity characteristics.</p><p> 我挖了我的右脚对抗橡胶，抬起我的左腿，试图保持我的手臂笔触短，然后向前移动，尽我所能扔掉。球足够接近撞击区，以在靠近板的Rapsodo跟踪装置上注册测量各种旋转和速度特性。</p><p>      Pitchers have always applied substances to try and gain an edge. Unless  blatantly abused, umpires rarely bother enforcing the rulebook. Managers seem fearful of accusing opponents knowing they have cheaters on their own staff. Mutually assured destruction results in a silent detente. However, in recent years, pitch-tracking data collected and shared publicly by Major League Baseball is uncovering just how much adding spin helps.</p><p>      投手始终应用物质来尝试并获得边缘。除非公然滥用，否则裁判很少责备执行规则书。经理们似乎害怕指责对手知道他们对自己的员工有骗子。相互确保的破坏导致沉默的拘留。但是，近年来，由主要联赛棒球公开收集和共享的音高跟踪数据正在揭开添加旋转有多少帮助。</p><p> How much? A lot. Since the start of last season, batters  are hitting .264 on four-seam fastballs that range from 2,250-2,350 rpm, a league-average range, and .217 against fastballs with greater than 2,500 rpm of spin.</p><p> 多少？很多。自上赛季的开始以来，击球手在四缝快球上击中.264，范围为2,250-2,350 rpm，联盟平均范围，和.217，对旋转2,500 rpm的痉挛。</p><p> More spin means more Magnus effect, which is the invisible force governing most pitch movement. More spin results in breaking pitches that break harder and fastballs that defy gravity just a little longer. That means weaker contact and more strikeouts. With the power of sticky stuff now quantified in hard data, it&#39;s only incentivized major-league pitchers to experiment. Spin rates and strikeouts are on the rise to record levels nearly every season. Batters are flirting with a historically low average this season.</p><p> 更多的旋转意味着更多的大效应，这是控制大多数俯仰运动的无形力。更多旋转导致破碎的间距打破更难以脱脂的速度和快速球的速度较长。这意味着较弱的接触和更多的三振出局。凭借现在在硬数据中量化的粘性物质的力量，它唯一会激励主要联盟投手来实验。旋转速率和三振出局在每个季节都越来越大。击球手正在历史上历史上平均调情。 </p><p> One could argue the greatest way for MLB to reduce strikeout rates and get more balls in play is to enforce its own rulebook and crack down on pitchers using foreign substances.</p><p>人们可以争论MLB减少截止率的最大方法，并在游戏中获得更多球是强制执行自己的规则本并使用异物的投手裂开。</p><p>  MLB issued a memo this spring warning pitchers it was serious about the issue, though there have been no punishments to date for major-league arms. The league is collecting suspicious balls this season for analysis, along now with Gallegos&#39; hat. It remains to be seen how MLB handles the issue. Four minor-league pitchers  were suspended this week for using foreign substances.</p><p>  MLB发出备忘录，这是这个春天警告投手，这对这个问题很重要，尽管大联盟武器迄今为止没有惩罚。联盟本赛季正在收集可疑球进行分析，现在与Gallegos＆＃39;帽子。 MLB如何处理问题仍有待观察。本周暂停了四个小联盟投手，用于使用异物。</p><p> &#34;The increased monitoring and inspection process in addition to the spin rate analysis outlined in the March 23rd memo sent to clubs are in effect,&#34; an MLB spokesperson wrote to theScore in an email. &#34;The central office data collection is ongoing.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;除了向俱乐部发给俱乐部的3月23日备忘录中概述的旋转速率分析，还有增加的监测和检查过程是否有效，＆＃34;一位MLB发言人在电子邮件中写信给Thescore。 ＆＃34;中央办公室数据收集正在进行中。＆＃34;</p><p> Every jar of Spider Tack is a proverbial can of worms. To get more balls in play, should baseball monitor pitchers more closely and penalize offenders before doing something radical like moving the mound back? For pitchers (and for batters worried about being hit by increasingly faster pitches), is there a substance beyond rosin that provides better grip and safety without dramatically increasing spin?</p><p> 每个蜘蛛大头钉是一个众所周知的蠕虫。为了获得更多的球在戏剧中，应该在做一些激进的东西之前更紧密地监测投手并惩罚违法者吗？对于投手（对于担心被越来越快的投球担心的击球），有没有一种超越松香的物质，可以提供更好的抓地力和安全性而没有显着增加旋转？</p><p> In a  back and forth on Twitter last week, Twins third baseman Josh Donaldson tweeted to former pitcher Dallas Braden about sticky stuff: &#34;Crazy idea here but I&#39;m going to throw it out there. Stop cheating!!&#34;</p><p> 上周在Twitter上来回，双胞胎第三垒队Josh Donaldson推文给前投手达拉斯布拉登关于粘性东西：＆＃34;这里疯狂的想法，但我会把它扔到那里。停止作弊!!＆＃34;</p><p> Braden countered, noting there are degrees of sticky and there&#39;s no precedent or clear way forward in how to enforce foreign substance violations.</p><p> Braden反击，注意到有粘性程度和＃39;在如何执行外国物质违规方面没有先例或明确的方式。</p><p> I agree. I have an entire catalog of video of these guys cheating it&#39;s coming out.</p><p> 我同意。我有一个整个目录的这些人的视频作弊＆＃39; s出来。 </p><p>— Josh Donaldson (@BringerOfRain20)  May 27, 2021</p><p>-  Josh Donaldson（@ Transerofrain20）2021年5月27日</p><p> To get inside this issue and understand the nature of these substances, I got my hands dirty in a converted Pittsburgh warehouse.</p><p> 为了进入这个问题并了解这些物质的性质，我在转换后的匹兹堡仓库中弄脏了我的手。</p><p>  Finding Performance Velocity Systems was a bit of a challenge. It&#39;s tucked behind an office building with no sign adorning the beige, cinder-block exterior. I called Pilewski and he appeared at the door, waving. The space was previously used to house the sports car collection of a local real estate developer. It was a true garage start-up.</p><p>  寻找性能速度系统有点挑战。它＆＃39;夹在办公大楼后面，没有标志，装饰米色，煤渣块外观。我打电话，他出现在门口，挥手。该空间以前用于容纳当地房地产开发商的跑车集合。这是一个真正的车库初创公司。</p><p> The interior reminded me of other training facilities that changed players&#39; careers and ushered in sweeping changes to development practices in pro baseball. Players don&#39;t need much space to get better, whether it&#39;s to add velocity, to change a swing, to shape a pitch - or to learn what substances to use. There&#39;s just enough room here for one full-length bullpen, and a couple of batting cages where weight training and stretching equipment competed for real estate.</p><p> 内部让我想起了其他培训设施，改变了球员＆＃39;职业生涯，并迎来了促进职业棒球发展实践的变化。玩家不需要大量空间来变得更好，无论是＆＃39; s增加速度，要改变摆动，塑造音调 - 或者学习什么物质使用。在这里有足够的空间，为一个全长的牛棚，以及一些击球笼，其中重量训练和伸展设备竞争房地产。</p><p>  The requisite green artificial turf covered the floor, and new fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. Pilewski upgraded the lighting to get better images from his high-speed cameras.</p><p>  必要的绿色人造草皮覆盖了地板，新的荧光灯嗡嗡声。 PILLWSKI升级了照明，从他的高速相机获得更好的图像。</p><p> The facility&#39;s existence speaks to the growing foothold data-based development is gaining. Its origin dates back to August 2014 when Pilewski’s son, Joey, suffered an elbow injury while trying out for a travel team. It required surgery and Pilewski felt guilty.</p><p> 该设施＆＃39; Sentence与不断增长的立足点数据的发展发言是获取的。它的起源日期返回2014年8月，当普雷斯基的儿子乔伊时，在试图旅行团队时遭受肘部受伤。它需要手术和PILLWSKI感到内疚。</p><p> “Did I do this? Did he play too much?&#34; Pilewski said he often asked himself. &#34;So I kind of gave myself a PhD in all things that make a good athlete. … I discovered everything I thought I knew was wrong. Once I was willing to accept that, I became very curious, academically, in a way I never was as a younger man.&#34;</p><p> “我这样做了吗？他玩得太多了吗？＆＃34; PILLWSKI说他经常问自己。 ＆＃34;所以我有点在所有制作一件好运动员的东西中给了自己的博士学位。 ......我发现了我认为我知道的一切都错了。一旦我愿意接受，我就成了非常好奇的，学术上，以一种我从未成为一个年轻人。＆＃34; </p><p> He sought a data-based approach to training better ways to throw, so other amateur players could better avoid injury and improve their skills. He began experimenting with things he was finding in scientific journals, and an obscure message board where pioneers like Kyle Boddy and Eric Cressey were regular posters in the early 2010s.</p><p>他寻求基于数据的方法来培训更好的方式来抛出，因此其他业余球员可以更好地避免受伤和提高他们的技能。他开始尝试他在科学期刊中找到的东西，以及一个晦涩的留言板，如凯尔·博迪和埃里克克雷西这样的先驱者是2010年初的常规海报。</p><p> Pilewski opened his facility in 2016. He replaced conventional coaching orthodoxy with a feedback loop of high-speed images and ballistic data on pitches. As far as the kids training here were aware, it&#39;s the only facility with a Rapsodo spin-tracking device in western Pennsylvania, other than the Pirates&#39; at PNC Park.</p><p> Pulwski于2016年开放了他的设施。他用高速图像和球场数据的反馈回路取代了传统的教练正统。就在这里的孩子们训练意识到，它＆＃39;在宾夕法尼亚州的西部宾夕法尼亚州的Rapsodo旋转跟踪装置的唯一设施，除海盗＆＃39;在PNC公园。</p><p>  Before we dipped into the substances, I needed to establish my spin and velocity baselines. I can&#39;t recall the last time I felt so self-aware.</p><p>  在我们浸入物质之前，我需要建立我的旋转和速度基线。我可以＆＃39;我回忆起我觉得如此自我意识到。</p><p> The mound seemed higher than 10 inches, and the plate further away than 60 feet, 6 inches. Moreover, there were the eyes watching me. It was the same familiar feeling of trying not to shank a drive on the first tee on a busy weekend morning at the local municipal golf course.</p><p> 土墩似乎高于10英寸，并且板更远超过60英尺，6英寸。而且，有眼睛看着我。在当地市政高尔夫球场的繁忙的周末早晨，这是同样熟悉的熟悉感觉。</p><p> &#34;You don&#39;t need to throw strikes but it needs to be close,&#34; Pilewski said, seated nearby with an iPad linked to the Rapsodo.</p><p> ＆＃34;你不需要扔罢工，但它需要关闭，＆＃34; Piplwski说，附近坐着，与Rapsodo联系在一起。</p><p>  I followed the two college players, who were in the low and upper 80s with their fastballs. I wouldn&#39;t come close to that, but I needed to throw at least 55 mph and near enough to the strike zone to be recorded by Rapsodo.</p><p>  我跟着两位大学球员，他们在低80年代的速度和上80年代。我不会接近那样，但我需要至少抛出55英里/小时，并且足够接近击打区域，以便通过Rapsodo录制。</p><p> With a clean right hand, I reached into the bucket and grabbed a baseball. I placed my right foot against the rubber and pushed off.</p><p> 用干净的右手，我达到桶里抓住棒球。我把右脚放在橡胶上并推断出来。 </p><p> The ball tracked near enough home plate to be recorded. Executing what appeared to be a strike in front of the small audience provided a rush of dopamine. I pivoted to the flatscreen on the wall and saw the results of the throw appear: 56.1 mph and 1,440 rpm.</p><p>球追踪近足够的家用板才能记录。在小型观众面前执行似乎是罢工，提供了多巴胺的匆忙。我枢转到墙上的平板上，看到抛出的结果出现：56.1英里/小时和1,440 rpm。</p><p>  With a few throws, we established I possessed an average fastball velocity of 56 mph, peaking at 59 mph. My spin rate landed in the mid 1,400s. What we were really interested in was to see how the rpm/mph ratio would change with various substances.</p><p>  随着少量投掷，我们建立了我拥有平均快球速度为56英里/小时，达到59英里/小时。我的旋转速率降落在1,400s中期。我们真正感兴趣的是，了解RPM / MPH比率如何随各种物质而改变。</p><p>  There are only two known, certain ways to increase spin: more velocity or sticky stuff. Even baseball&#39;s go-to physicist, Dr. Alan Nathan,  told me he doubts there&#39;s much a pitcher could do with his grip to increase his fastball spin rate naturally. Grip changes do influence breaking ball spin rate, but trainers at Driveline Baseball in suburban Seattle found it was nearly impossible to increase rpm/mph ratios for fastballs without more velocity or sticky stuff. They dubbed the rpm/mph measurement the &#34;Bauer Unit&#34; because their first MLB client, Trevor Bauer, was so interested in experimenting with it.</p><p>  只有两个众所周知的，有些方法可以增加旋转：更多的速度或粘性的东西。甚至是棒球＆＃39;去物理学家，艾伦纳森博士告诉我他怀疑那里＆＃39;一个投手可以用他的抓地力自然增加他的快球旋转速率。抓地力变化会影响破坏球旋转速率，但在西雅图郊区的传动系棒球的培训师发现它几乎不可能增加Fastballs的RPM / MPH比没有更多的速度或粘性的东西。它们被称为RPM / MPH测量和＃34;鲍尔单位＆＃34;因为他们的第一个MLB客户，Trevor Bauer非常感兴趣。</p><p> My fastball rpm/mph ratio of 25.7 was not much different from this season&#39;s major-league average of 24.8.</p><p> 我的Fastball RPM / MPH比率为25.7与本赛季的不同与24.8的主要联盟平均值不同。</p><p> Curran&#39;s baseline was 24.1 rpm/mph, as his fastball sat between 86 and 87.5 mph with between 2,016 and 2,090 rpm. Colcombe&#39;s baseline was 22.6 rpm/mph, with his fastball registering from 82.9 to 84.1 mph.</p><p> Curran＆＃39; S基线是24.1rpm / mph，因为他的快球坐在86到87.5英里/小时之间，2,016到2,090转。 Colcombe＆＃39; S基线是22.6rpm / mph，他的快球从82.9点注射到84.1英里/小时。</p><p> I didn&#39;t bother trying to throw a breaking ball, but Colcombe ripped off a baseline slider with 2,058 rpm, good for a 26.9 rpm/mph spin ratio. Curran throws more of a slurve and one of his baseline offerings reached 2,033 rpm, good for a 27 ratio.</p><p> 我没有打扰抛出一个突破球，但Colcombe撕掉了2,058 rpm的基线滑块，适用于26.9rpm / mph自旋比。 Curran抛出更多的浆液，其中一个基线产品达到2,033 rpm，适用于27个比例。</p><p>   It&#39;s increased most years of the  Statcast era, to a record-high four-seam rate of 2,319 rpm this year. That&#39;s in part because velocity keeps increasing. But the rpm/mph ratio is also increasing, which shouldn&#39;t happen - unless more pitchers are using sticky stuff or pitchers are optimizing the sticky stuff they&#39;re already using. MLB&#39;s four-seam fastball rpm/mph ratio continues to inch up from 24 in 2015, to 24.3 in 2018, to 24.8 this year.</p><p>   它＆＃39增加了大多数大多数的STATCAST时代，今年的历史新高的四缝率为2,319 rpm。其中部分是因为速度不断增加。但是RPM / MPH比率也在增加，这应该发生，除非更多的投手是使用粘性物质或投手来优化他们已经使用的粘性物质。 MLB＆＃39; S的四缝快球RPM / MPH比率从2015年的24次继续到2018年的24.3，到今年24.3。 </p><p> Pitchers like Gerrit Cole and Bauer curiously increased their fastball spin rates dramatically in recent years, helping vault them to elite status among starters.</p><p>像Gerrit Cole和Bauer这样的投手奇怪地在近年来急剧增加了他们的Fastball旋转速率，帮助他们在初学者中的精英地位。</p><p> Ironically, Bauer blew the whistle on substance usage back in 2018, apparently proving his  point in one game, and calling the performance benefits greater &#34;than steroids.&#34; In 2020, he began enjoying his own spin-rate spike. MLB confiscated game balls from at least one Bauer start this season.</p><p> 具有讽刺意味的是，Bauer在2018年吹响了物质的哨声，显然在一场比赛中证明了他的观点，并呼吁表现优势更大＆＃34;比类固醇。＆＃34;在2020年，他开始享受自己的自旋速率飙升。 MLB从至少一名鲍尔开始被没收的游戏球开始本赛季。</p><p> Cole was named by former Angels clubhouse attendant Brian &#34;Bubba&#34; Harkins as one of a number of MLB pitchers who used a special concoction of sticky stuff he created. Harkins  was fired by the Angels after the club learned through an MLB investigation that he was supplying this substance to pitchers.</p><p> 科尔被前天使俱乐部助理Brian＆＃34命名为Bubba＆＃34;哈金斯作为一些使用他创建的粘性物质的特殊混合物的MLB投手之一。在俱乐部在俱乐部通过MLB调查学到他正在向投手提供这种物质后，哈氏被天使发射。</p><p> A January 2019 text exchange between Cole and Harkins was submitted to Orange County Superior Court in January as evidence Harkins was, as his attorney claimed, made a &#34;public scapegoat.&#34;</p><p> 2019年1月在1月份的COLE和Harkins之间的文本交流作为他的律师声称的证据哈金斯，成为A＆＃34;公共替罪羊。＆＃34;</p><p> &#34;Hey Bubba, it&#39;s Gerrit Cole, I was wondering if you could help me out with this sticky situation,&#34; the pitcher wrote, adding a wink emoji. &#34;We don&#39;t see you until May, but we have some road games in April that are in cold weather places. The stuff I had last year seizes up when it gets cold.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;嘿bubba，它＆＃39; s gerrit Cole，我想知道你是否可以帮助我解决这个粘性情况，＆＃34;投手写道，添加了一个眨眼emoji。 ＆＃34;我们在5月之前看到你，但我们在4月份有一些道路比赛，寒冷的天气。当我感冒时，我去年的东西会抓住。＆＃34;</p><p> In his three Statcast-tracked  years with the Pirates from 2015-17, Cole&#39;s four-seam fastball averaged between 2,155 and 2,184 rpm. He posted a 3.52 ERA in that span. In his first year in Houston in 2018, his spin rate jumped to 2,379. Also in Houston then was spin-rate king Justin Verlander, another player Harkins named as using sticky stuff. Cole&#39;s spin rate has continued to rise - it&#39;s been above 2,500 rpm every year since 2019. Since hiking his spin rate, he owns a 2.60 ERA. His fastball went from being crushed in 2017 to nearly unhittable.</p><p> 在2015-17的海盗的三年中，COLE＆＃39; S的四缝快球平均在2,155和2,184 rpm之间。他在那个跨度发布了3.52时代。在2018年休斯顿的第一年，他的旋转速率跃升至2,379。此外，休斯顿然后是旋转速率King Justin Verlander，另一名球员哈尔辛被命名为使用粘性东西。 COLE＆＃39; S的旋转速率持续上升 - 它以来一直在2019年以来每年超过2,500 rpm。自从抢劫速率以来，他拥有2.60时代。他的快球从2017年被粉碎到几乎不稳定。</p><p>  While fastballs are spinning more than ever, breaking balls are typically the greatest swing-and-miss pitches in baseball.</p><p>  虽然快速球比以往任何时候都多，但打破球通常是棒球中最大的挥杆和错过的球场。 </p><p> Consider that the average  slider spin rate this year sits at a tracking-era record of 2,458 rpm compared to 2,106 rpm in 2015, even though the average velocity declined slightly by 0.3 mph in that span to 84.7 mph this year. That&#39;s a rpm/mph jump from 24.8 to 29.</p><p>考虑到今年的平均滑块旋转速率达到2,458 rpm的跟踪记录，而2015年为2,106 rpm，即使平均速度略微下降0.3英里/小时，这是今年的84.7英里/小时。这是一个RPM / MPH跳跃从24.8到29。</p><p> Curveballs? A similar story. They&#39;re averaging a record 2,553  rpm this year, up from 2,303 in 2015. The Bauer Unit ratio? It&#39;s 32.2 rpm/mph this year compared to 29.3 in 2015. In examining FanGraphs&#39; pitch movement data, curveballs are  dropping more and fastballs are rising more than ever before.</p><p> 曲线球？类似的故事。他们＆＃39;今年的历史记录2,553 rpm，从2015年的2,303起。鲍尔单位比率？ ＆＃39; S 32.2 RPM / MPH今年与2015年的29.3相比。在检查扇形＆＃39;俯仰运动数据，曲线球正在滴下更多，比以往任何时候都更加崛起。</p><p> The game is taking notice. During quarantine, Pilewski held a physics of baseball Zoom class with his younger clients, 12- and 13-year-old kids. They loved it. Jocks are becoming nerds.</p><p> 游戏是通知的。在检疫期间，Pipwski与他的年轻客户，12-岁和13岁的孩子们举行了棒球放大课的物理学。他们喜欢它。 jocks正在成为书呆子。</p><p>  We agreed to test substances in a sequential order from what we hypothesized to be least sticky to most. We saved the Spider Tack for last knowing it might be difficult to scrub off, and like any good wannabe scientist, I was trying to keep variables isolated. We went to the restroom between each set of throws to decontaminate our hands.</p><p>  我们同意以连续的顺序测试物质，从我们假设到最不粘稠。我们拯救了蜘蛛钉最后知道可能很难擦洗，就像任何好的Wannabe科学家一样，我试图保持孤立的变量。我们去了每一套抛出的洗手间来消除双手。</p><p>  The first substance we tested was rosin, the one legal agent, a powdered resin derived from pine trees.</p><p>  我们测试的第一种物质是松香，一种法律试剂，衍生自松树的粉末树脂。</p><p> I opened the small Rawlings pouch of rosin that arrived from Amazon and handed it to Curran. He tossed it in his hand and then pelted it into the wooden mound to compel some of the powder to disperse so he could collect it on his hand from the throwing platform.</p><p> 我打开了从亚马逊到达的松香小罗林斯小袋，并将其交给核。他把它扔在手里，然后将它塞进木制土墩中以迫使一些粉末驱散，所以他可以从投掷平台上收集它的手。</p><p> &#34;I&#39;m going to bet it goes down,&#34; Pilewski said of Curran&#39;s spin rate. &#34;I bet you $5 it goes down with rosin.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我打赌它会下注，＆＃34; PILPWSKI对CURRAN＆＃39; S旋转率。 ＆＃34;我打赌你5美元，它与松香一起下来。＆＃34; </p><p> Curran looks like a pro prospect. He&#39;s 6-foot-4, adding bulk to his lanky frame since beginning to train here. He coated his right hand in the white dust, working it into his thumb, index, and middle fingers, and took a ball. He lifted his left leg, advanced down the platform, and tossed a fastball into the net. A reading of 87.2 mph flashed up in golden digits on the velocity board behind home plate.</p><p>Curran看起来像一个专业的前景。他＆＃39; S 6-Foot-4，自从开始训练以来向他的Lanky框架添加批量。他涂上了右手在白色的尘土中，把它倒入他的拇指，指数和中指，并拿了一个球。他抬起左腿，在平台上升，并将踢球扔进网上。在家用板后面的速度板上的金色数字刷新了87.2英里/小时。</p><p> We then all looked toward the flatscreen mounted to the far wall over Curran&#39;s shoulder, and were surprised by what we saw. By only applying the legal grip-enhancer, Curran&#39;s spin rate jumped to 2,213 rpm.</p><p> 然后我们都朝着柯兰特曲墙上安装到远壁的平板上，并惊讶于我们所看到的。仅仅应用法律抓地力，Curran＆＃39; S旋转速率跳跃到2,213 rpm。</p><p>   After a few throws, Curran&#39;s average spin was up by more than 100 rpm compared to his baseline of 2016-2,090 rpm. His Bauer Units ratio jumped from 24.1 to 25.2. It resulted in measurable change to his fastball&#39;s movement. He gained two inches of lift - really two inches less drop.</p><p>   几次抛出后，与2016  -  2,090 rpm的基线相比，Curran＆＃39的平均旋转超过100 rpm。他的鲍尔单位比例从24.1跳至25.2。它导致他的快球和＃39的运动变化。他上涨了两英寸的升力 - 真的两英寸减少了。</p><p> &#34;This is crazy,&#34; Pilewski said. &#34;It&#39;s one of those things where you kind of know but you don&#39;t know.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;这是疯狂的，＆＃34; pipswski说。 ＆＃34;它＆＃39;你知道的那些东西之一，但你不知道。＆＃34;</p><p> Colcombe, a lefty with a slighter frame but a smooth arm stroke, applied the rosin, took a ball with his left hand, and whipped it into the net. His fastball numbers didn&#39;t change much with rosin, but he ripped off one slider that darted at 2,140 rpm.</p><p> Colcombe，一个带较轻的框架，但是光滑的臂上，施加了一个漂亮的胳膊，用左手拿着一个球，并将它搅打到网上。他的快球数量没有改变松香，但他扯掉了一个以2,140转/分的滑块扯下。</p><p> &#34;When he threw the true slider the number went up,&#34; Pilewski said. &#34;Almost 200 rpms.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;当他扔掉真正的滑块时，数字上升了，＆＃34; pipswski说。 ＆＃34;近200 rpms。＆＃34;</p><p>  I was next. I applied the rosin to my hand, and rubbed it into my fingertips. It was fine and powdery but with a tackiness. It was like a dough residue after combining egg and flour. I went into my awkward, rigid motion, and threw as hard as I could, which was demoralizing knowing the velocity was still less than a Zack Greinke eephus pitch. My first attempt bounced well before the plate.</p><p>  我接下来了。我把松香涂抹在我的手上，并将它揉成了我的指尖。它很好，粉状，但有粘性。结合鸡蛋和面粉后，它就像一个面团残留物。我陷入了尴尬，僵硬的动作，尽可能地扔扔，这知道速度仍然少于Zack Greinke Eephus音调。我的第一次尝试在盘子前跳得很好。 </p><p> I took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. On my next attempt, the ball thwacked into the netting behind home plate. The results appeared: 58.5 mph and 1,580 rpm. The rosin had given me a similar jump. It was something like sorcery, and this was the legal stuff.</p><p>我深吸一口气，慢慢呼出。在我的下一次尝试时，球会被送入家庭板后面的网。结果出现：58.5英里/小时和1,580 rpm。松香给了我一个类似的跳跃。这是巫术的东西，这是法律的东西。</p><p>   Colcombe arrived here like so many early adopters to this data age of player development: he was injured.</p><p>   Colcombe在这里到达了这么多早期的参与者对此玩家发展的数据时代：他受伤了。</p><p> As a sophomore in 2017 at Peters Township High south of Pittsburgh, he suffered a Grade 2 strain to his UCL. Colcombe felt like there had to be a better way to train, to throw. His mom felt that way, too, and took to the internet.</p><p> 作为2017年彼得斯堡南部的彼得乡，他对他的UCL遭受了2级伤害。 Colcombe觉得必须有更好的培训方式，抛出。他的妈妈也感受到了，也有互联网。</p><p> &#34;My mom found this place on Twitter, and the rest has been history,&#34; Colcombe said.</p><p> ＆＃34;我的妈妈在推特上找到了这个地方，其余的一直是历史，＆＃34; Colcombe说。</p><p> It&#39;s remarkable how important social media has become in player self-empowerment and idea-sharing. Pilewski immediately began Colcombe on a weighted-ball regimen, including tosses from unusual angles, as a way to train the body to move more efficiently, and to train the body implicitly, without verbal cues.</p><p> 它＆＃39;非常重要的社交媒体在球员自我赋权和想法共享中有多重要。 PILPOWSKI立即开始在加权球方案上进行COLCOMBE，包括从不寻常的角度抛出，作为培训身体更有效地移动的方式，并隐含地训练身体，没有口头线索。</p><p> &#34;I trusted him right away. I really did,&#34; Colcombe said of Pilewski. &#34;Pretty quickly I realized my arm is getting better.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我马上相信他。我真的做了，＆＃34; Colcombe的Pulwski说。 ＆＃34;很快我意识到我的手臂越来越好。＆＃34;</p><p>  Three years later, he improved enough to sign with the University of Pittsburgh. His focus is now on pitch design as he tries to create a more distinct breaking ball from his fastball. At Pittsburgh, he didn&#39;t have access to working pitch-tracking tech. He&#39;s hoping to transfer to a mid-major Division I program with a strong business school and focus on pitching development.</p><p>  三年后，他提高了足够的匹兹堡大学签约。他的焦点现在正在投球设计，因为他试图从他的快球创造一个更独特的断裂球。在匹兹堡，他没有进入工作的音乐追踪技术。他希望通过强大的商学院转移到我的中长师，并专注于推销发展。 </p><p> Curran&#39;s father knew he needed to throw with more velocity if he was to reach his goals of making the varsity team at Mt. Lebanon High and pitching in college. Like Colcombe, he was one of Pilewski&#39;s earliest clients, arriving in the fall of 2017 as a high school junior.</p><p>Curran＆＃39; S父亲知道他需要扔进更多的速度，如果他能够达到在Mt中制作校兵团队的目标。黎巴嫩高高兴色。像Colcombe一样，他是最早的普遍的客户之一，抵达2017年秋季的高中初中。</p><p> While he&#39;d taken private lessons about once a week, his throwing between those appointments was irregular, so Pilewski put him on regular throwing and weight-training programs.</p><p> 虽然他每周约有一次私人课程，但他之间的投掷是不规则的，因此Pipwski将他置于定期投掷和体重训练计划。</p><p> &#34;Beginning of junior year, when I first came in here, I was 79 (mph). For my high school tryouts, I was 83. That was over six months,&#34; Curran said. &#34;I had a really good year, junior year, and I attribute it to working on velocity.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;初级年初，当我第一次进来时，我是79（英里/小时）。对于我的高中试训，我是83个。超过六个月，＆＃34; Curran说。 ＆＃34;我有一个非常好的一年，初级年，我把它归功于速度。＆＃34;</p><p> He became a two-year letter winner and signed with Division II Seton Hill. More and more players began walking through Pilewski&#39;s door. They all want to get better. And they are curious.</p><p> 他成为一个为期两年的胜利者，并与II赛赛赛赛司机签署。越来越多的球员开始穿过桩子＆＃39的门。他们都希望变得更好。他们很好奇。</p><p>  After emerging from the restroom with pristine hands, we were ready for a sticky substance recipe that is widely used in professional and college baseball, one Shildt ranted about all pitchers using: a mix of sunscreen with rosin. And it&#39;s a specific sunscreen many are using, the BullFrog Water Sport variety that boasts of adhering to wet skin and that &#34;goes on clear,&#34; appealing words for pitchers seeking an edge.</p><p>  在用原始手中的洗手间出现后，我们已经为粘性物质配方提供了广泛应用于专业和大学棒球的粘性食谱，其中一个Shildt咆哮着所有的投手：混合遮光剂与松香。它和＃39;许多特定的防晒剂是使用的，牛蛙水上运动品种伴随着粘附在湿皮肤和＆＃34;继续，＆＃34;吸引人寻求优势的投手的吸引人的话语。</p><p> Out of curiosity, I asked that we begin with just BullFrog su</p><p> 出于好奇心，我问我们开始只是牛蛙苏</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/2180019">https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/2180019</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/秘密/">#秘密</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/dirty/">#dirty</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/物质/">#物质</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
