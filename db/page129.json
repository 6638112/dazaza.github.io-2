Nine minutes later, the rocket&#39;s first stage touched down on the deck of &#34;Just Read the Instructions,&#34; one of SpaceX&#39;s two drone ships.\n  &#34;What a beautiful view of the first stage landing,&#34; Youmei Zhou, a SpaceX propulsion engineer, said during the company&#39;s live launch commentary.\n The GPS III SV05 satellite mission is the second to launch so far this month for SpaceX, following   the launch of a broadband satellite for Sirius XM on June 6.\n    It was nothing but blue skies over the launch pad, and onlookers were treated to a gorgeous view as the rocket climbed to orbit.\n Today&#39;s flight marks the fourth GPS satellite delivery by SpaceX for the U.S. military. Three previous advanced GPS III missions   also launched on Falcon 9 rockets, including two missions   last year. Another of the satellites launched in August 2019 on the United Launch Alliance&#39;s   final flight of the Delta IV Medium rocket.\n &#34;If you&#39;ve ever used your phone&#39;s mapping service or retrieved a location via a pin drop, you\u2019ve used a satellite in this system,&#34; Zhou said.\n  The U.S. military plans to launch a total of 10 upgraded   GPS satellites, as part of an effort to replace aging members of its current constellation. SpaceX has also secured a contract to launch the next GPS III mission as well, which is planned for sometime next year.\n Built by   Lockheed Martin in Colorado, the GPS III-SV05 satellite, named after Neil Armstrong, is the fifth member of an upgraded generation of GPS navigation spacecraft that is designed to beam down higher-power signals that are more resilient to jamming and boast additional broadcast frequencies to make the GPS network more compatible with other similar constellations, Lockheed representatives have said.\n    The 227-foot-tall (70 meters) Falcon 9 is SpaceX&#39;s workhorse rocket and boasts more than 1.5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff. Today&#39;s mission featured a first for the Space Force: flying a payload on a used rocket.\n Last year, the agency gave SpaceX the green light to fly its payloads on refurbished rockets. That decision followed on the heels of another recent announcement to allow SpaceX to recover the rocket&#39;s first stage during national security missions \u2014 something that was previously not allowed.\n The next two GPS missions, which are already scheduled to fly on SpaceX rockets sometime next year, will now launch atop refurbished rockets.\n All of this is great news for SpaceX, as the company has been relying heavily on its fleet of veteran rockets, with many Falcon 9 first stages having racked up five or more flights each.\n Out of 19 missions so far this year, only one has featured a brand new Falcon 9; the rest were on flight-proven boosters.\n It&#39;s also great news for Space Force and taxpayers as flying on reused rockets translates to a savings of nearly $53 million across the two flights (GPS III-SV05 and GPS III-SV06), Space Force officials said.\n   The military has given nicknames to each of the upgraded GPS satellites, naming them after famous explorers. The satellite that launched today was given the moniker &#34;  Neil Armstrong&#34; after the NASA astronaut who made history as the first person to step foot on the moon.\n Previous satellites have been named &#34;  Vespucci&#34; and &#34;  Magellan&#34; in honor of explorers Amerigo Vespucci and Ferdinand Magellan. The most recent one that launched in November was named \u201cSacagewea\u201d after the guide who led Lewis and Clark on their famous expedition in the 1800s.\n None of the names are official, just nicknames given to the satellites as part of a space flight tradition of naming spacecraft as well as a way to honor the great explorers of the past.\n Space Force officials say other satellites to come will be named after space icons like Amelia Earhart,   Sally Ride and   Katherine Johnson.\n   Today&#39;s mission marks the 122nd Falcon 9 rocket to fly and the 19th mission of 2021 for SpaceX. It also marks the 89th successful booster recovery. SpaceX&#39;s drone ship &#34;Just Read the Instructions&#34; was positioned out in the Atlantic Ocean, awaiting the recovery attempt.\n The company&#39;s other drone ship, &#34;Of Course I Still Love You,&#34; is on its way to the West Coast. The massive ship departed Port Canaveral last week, embarking on a journey through the Panama Canal. It will eventually dock in the port of Los Angeles and begin West Coast recovery operations for SpaceX.\n A third drone ship, &#34;A Shortfall of Gravitas,&#34; is almost complete and will be heading to Port Canaveral to help keep up with SpaceX&#39;s rapid launch and recovery rate.\n The booster B1062 was the star of the show today, and it is the first Falcon 9 booster to carry two different GPS satellites to orbit. It&#39;s also the first used Falcon 9 to loft one of these advanced global positioning satellites.\n   The rocket&#39;s nose cone (or payload fairing) is the protective shell housing the payload. It deploys once the rocket reaches a certain altitude. Historically the hardware has been tossed aside, never to be used again.\n With each Falcon 9 fairing half worth an estimated $3 million, SpaceX has worked to recover them and fly them again in recent years as part of its reusability efforts. The fairings use parachutes to slow their descent so they can be retrieved from the ocean.\n SpaceX has been shuffling around recovery boats, and even hiring some temporary help, in order to recover those fairings from the ocean. The fairing recovery vessel for today&#39;s launch is making its debut here in Florida. The black and orange boat, named Hos Briarwood, will hoist the fairings out of the water with its on board crane. If they&#39;re in good shape, they may fly again soon.\n SpaceX has another mission to come this month, as the company continues with its rideshare program. The Transporter-2 mission is scheduled to launch on June 24 and will launch a whole host of satellites, similar to the company&#39;s   record-setting 143-satellite Transporter-1 mission in 2020.\n Join our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

The move is largely aimed at regulated industries \u2014 like finance, healthcare, and defense \u2014 where intellectual property and sensitive data are subject to intense privacy and compliance rules.\n  The real magic lands later in the year when Google will publish details of an API that will let enterprise customers build their own in-house key service, allowing workplaces to retain direct control of their encryption keys. That means if the government wants that company\u2019s data, they have to knock on their front door \u2014 and not sneak around the back by serving the key holder with a legal demand.\n Google  published technical details of how the client-side encryption feature works, and will roll out as a beta in the coming weeks.\n Tech companies giving their corporate customers control of their own encryption keys has been a growing trend in recent years.  Slack and  cloud vendor Egnyte bucked the trend by allowing their enterprise users to store their own encryption keys, effectively cutting themselves out of the surveillance loop. But Google has dragged its feet on encryption for so long that startups are working to build  alternatives that bake in encryption from the ground up.\n Google said it\u2019s also pushing out new trust rules for how files are shared in Google Drive to give administrators more granularity on how different levels of sensitive files can be shared, and new data classification labels to mark documents with a level of sensitivity such as \u201csecret\u201d or \u201cinternal\u201d.\n The company said it\u2019s improving its malware protection efforts by now blocking phishing and malware shared from within organizations.

Please sign up today!\n   As movement toward memory-safe languages, and  Rust in particular, continues togrow, it is worth looking atone of the larger scale efforts to port C code that has existed for decadesto Rust. The  uutils project aims torewrite all of the individual utilities included in the  GNU Coreutils project inRust. Originally created by JordiBoggiano in 2013, the project aims to provide drop-inreplacements for the Coreutils programs, addingthe data-race protection and memory safety that Rust provides.\n Many readers will be familiar with the Coreutils project. Itincludes the basic file, process, and text manipulation programs that areexpected to exist on every GNU-based operating system. The Coreutilsproject was created to consolidate three sets of tools that were previously offeredseparately, Fileutils, Textutils, and Shellutils, along with some othermiscellaneous utilities. Many of the programs that areincluded in the project, such as  rm,  du,  ls,and  cat, have been around for multiple decades and, though other  implementations exist, theseutilities are not available for platforms like Windows in their original form.\n Collectively, the Coreutils programs are seen as low-hanging fruit wherea working Rust-based version can be produced in a reasonable amount oftime. The requirements for each utility are clear and many of the them areconceptually straightforward, although that&#39;s not to suggest that the workis easy. While a lot of progress has been made to get uutilsinto a usable state, it will take some time for it to reach thestability and maturity of Coreutils.\n The use of Rust for thisproject will help to speed this process along since a huge swathe ofpossible memory errors and other undefined behavior is eliminatedentirely. It also opens the door to the use of efficient, race-freemultithreading which has the potential to speed up some of the programsunder certain conditions. The uutils rewrite also provides an opportunity to not justreimplement Coreutils but to also enhance the functionality of some ofthe utilities to yield a better user experience, while maintainingcompatibility with the GNU versions. For example, feature requests thathave long been  rejectedin the Coreutils project, like adding a progress bar option forutilities like  mv and  cp, are currently being  entertained inthis Rust rewrite.\n  On the project&#39;s GitHubpage, a  table can be foundwith the utilities divided into three columns: &#34;Done&#34;,&#34;Semi-Done&#34;, and &#34;To-Do&#34;. At the time of this writing, only 23 of the 106utilities being worked on are not yet in the &#34;Done&#34; column, with 16 of themmarked as &#34;Semi-Done&#34; and seven under the &#34;To-Do&#34; column. The utilities under&#34;To-Do&#34; have either not been worked on at all or are currently undergoing theirinitial implementation (like with   pr and   chcon). Thosein the &#34;Semi-Done&#34; column are missing options that have not yet beenimplemented, or their behavior is slightly different from their GNUcounterparts in certain situations. For example:\n Several utilities do not support non-UTF-8 arguments, although this islargely being mitigated by migrating from  getopts to  clap for command-line argumentparsing.\n It is important to keep in mind that just because a program is marked as&#34;Done&#34; doesn&#39;t mean that all of the tests are passing or that the utility isas performant or memory-efficient as the GNU version. For example, thereare open issues to  improve theperformance of  factor (roughly 5x slower) and   sort(between 1.5x to 6x slower). In some other cases, the uutils versions are fasterthan their GNU equivalents. An example is the  cp utility in whicha measurable performance improvement has been  reported,primarily due to the use of the   sendfile()and   copy_file_range()system calls, which are not being used in the GNU version despite several proposals to do so.\n At the moment, only 142 of 624 tests in the Coreutils test suite arepassing compared to around 546 tests passing with the GNU version. However, it should be noted that many of the errors are due todifferences in the output of the commands.\n A separate  tablealso exists to show all of the platforms and architectures that the uutilsproject currently supports. The major operating systems (Linux, macOS, andWindows) are well accounted for across various architectures althoughquite a few utilities are currently not building on Windows. FreeBSD,NetBSD, and Android also compile most binaries except for a handful of utilities including  chroot, uptime,  uname,  stat,  who, andothers. The rows for Redox OS, Solaris, WebAssembly, and Fuchsia arecurrently all blank, which reflects the lower priority assigned to thoseplatforms at the moment.\n The uutils project, currently at version\u00a00.0.6, has already been packaged inthe repositories for various Linux distributions and packagingsystems. Notably, Sylvestre Ledru, a director at Mozilla and prolificcontributor to the Debian and Ubuntu projects, has  ledthe way in getting the project  packaged for Debian as analternative to the GNU Coreutils. Its current state is deemed good enoughto get a system with GNOME up and running, install a thousand of the mostpopular Debian packages, and to build Firefox, the Linux kernel, andLLVM/Clang. Additionally, uutils is present in the  repositories for ArchLinux (Community),  Homebrewfor macOS,and the  ExherboLinux distribution.\n  An important aspect of the uutils project to be aware of is itslicensing. All of the utilities in the project are licensedunder the permissive MIT License, instead of the GPLv3 license of GNUCoreutils. This potentially makes it more attractive for use in places where software licensed with GPLv3 is not adopted due to its restrictionson  Tivoization amongother things. The decision to use the MIT License is not without its critics; somewho commented in a  GitHub issue aboutthe choice would rather see a copyleft license applied to a project ofthis sort.\n The main criticism echoes arguments over FOSS licensing in the past:a non-copyleft license is harmful to the freedoms of end userssince it allows a person or organization to incorporate any part of theproject into a device or in the distribution of other software withoutproviding the source code so it is impossible tostudy, change, or improve it.There is also a concern that the license choice is being made to maximizeRust usage without regard for other effects; replacing GPL-licensed tools withalternatives under a more-permissive license is seen by some as a step backward.\n  The best way to follow the development of the uutils project is throughits GitHub repository andofficial  Discord server.Details on how to get started contributing to the project can be found in a documentthat is included in the repository.\n A lot of work remains to be done to get uutils into aproduction-ready state. The project has been positioned as a good way get into Rustdevelopment and there is a  listof issues for newcomers as a place to begin. Thecurrent focus of the project appears to be full compatibility with the GNUCoreutils and improving the test coverage before tackling otherproblems. Things like removing unnecessary dependencies, improvingperformance, and decreasing memory use are better suited to beingaddressed after the compatibility issues have been ironed out.\n     ( Log in to post comments)\n  One thing I&#39;d love for a new and more modern coreutils: io_uring support everywhere. There&#39;s already a cp fork that supposedly does great ( https://wheybags.com/blog/wcp.html), but when ls-ing a bazillion files on HDD, it screams for io_uring to get into the head of that elevator algorithm. Same with tar! (Even if tar isn&#39;t part of coreutils.)\n io_uring everywhere to take care of the async I/O, and work-stealing thread pools on every for loop for the computation.   Now that languages like Rust are making thread-safety practically the default, it is getting a bit silly to iterate over items with only one core while the other 7 or 15 watch.  Legacy tools are being very innefficient with both, currently. Even git is criminally underthreaded and often blocking on serial I/O.   Though that is slowly being improved, the software has not kept up with the silicon, and that is because the abstractions we had made it too hard.   Hail the new languages and the bloated libraries like Tokio. They compile to megabytes of statically linked copies, but boy is it nice to have a modern and fast runtime underneath instead of all the barely-reentrant-half-the-time and definitely blocking POSIX legacy!\n In ls doing all those stat() and systemcalls are way way heavier than any CPU processing.  You can use several threads but they are blocking each other out to access the same hardware resource, and remember that switching thread is not cheap at all, so in the end you are likely to end up with a multicore version of ls that is also way slower and has much much more complex code that is also more error prone.\n I think the point of using io_uring was not try to use mulitiple cores in user space, but to allow kernel to do stat IO operations in parallel. On both SSD and HDD it should be 10x faster.\n  &gt; remember that switching thread is not cheap at all  This isn&#39;t really true in this day and age. It used to be quite expensive, but that&#39;s no longer the case (in the common case). Of course it&#39;s still more expensive than not doing it (assuming that you cannot do anything productive with that parallelism), but that&#39;s neither here nor there.  Anyway, the point of io_uring is avoiding traversing the userland&lt;-&gt;kernel boundary unless absolutely required because *THAT* is expensive.  More generally, I&#39;d also challenge your assertion that accessing the hardware in a multithreaded fashion doesn&#39;t have gains. Sure, it might not do much for spinning rust, but SSDs can certainly handle multiple non-interfering I/O operations.\n (Apologies for the self-reply.)  Note also that parallelizing I/O can actually also help with the latency incurred between userland and the actual device latency. The more commands you can queue ahead of time, the more commands the device can go through in a rapid fire fashion -- even in the case where no actual parallel fetching/writing can happen on the device itself.\n And if you scattergun 10 requests at one hdd, the kernel tries to re-order them to minimise the overall time - it should spot if two are close together, and read them one after the other in the right order, etc etc.\n Not just the kernel - all modern storage devices also reorder requests to minimise the overall time. Every level in the stack below the application benefits from having deep queues; the only reason to not issue all the I/O you can at once is that you might not be able to handle the responses as fast as they come in. Otherwise, you might as well queue up as much I/O as you can keep track of; the kernel will do its re-ordering, and the device can reorder anything from 31 commands upwards to maximise throughput.\n  &gt; Anyway, the point of io_uring is avoiding traversing the userland&lt;-&gt;kernel boundary unless absolutely required because *THAT* is expensive.  That is certainly a part of the point, but not the entire point. Probably more important than that is to be able to do issue many I/Os in parallel, ie., it finally gives Linux usable, performant async I/O. This is required if you want to drive modern SSDs fast, but also for many small files on a HDD. When I implemented io_uring support in plocate, that was the big killer; being able to issue 256 stat()s at once and watch the kernel reorder them into one big head sweep, as opposed to jittering back and forth over the disk. (You&#39;ll see a similar thing when ls-ing or cp-ing many (small) files.) Syscall overhead didn&#39;t play into it at all; in fact, nearly all the gains were realized in the prototype implementation where I called io_uring_enter() once for every stat, ie., no reduction in syscall overhead at all.\n You&#39;re right. I was being a bit oblique I suppose... One of the advantages is the ability to avoid the syscall overhead of all of select(), epoll() etc. ... which means that it&#39;s a lot cheaper to just queue up IO. :)\n  it is getting a bit silly to iterate over items with only one core while the other 7 or 15 watch.\n Only if that program is the only process running! Especially with utilities like this, you may not assume you have the whole CPU to yourself. Sometimes it is true, usually not.\n True, but can&#39;t the utility also increase its CPU nice value while keeping the I/O niceness low to reflect that the parallelism is mainly about I/O than CPU utilization?\n Why should a utility that is I/O-bound and only uses minimal CPU time increase the CPU nice value? Such a utility should have a low CPU-nice value such that in case it needs the CPU (for a very short time) to issue the next IO operation it can do so and make the most efficient use of the available IO bandwidth. For other tasks it should not matter whether the few msec of CPU time needed are nice or non-nice, but for the utility it certainly matters whether it has to wait for the CPU or not.  And of course, high nice values are for background tasks where the user is not waiting for the output. If I run a core utility from the shell, I want to have the result now and I do not care whether a background task has to wait.\n  Posted Jun 9, 2021 18:09 UTC (Wed) by  Cyberax ( \u272d supporter \u272d, #52523) [ Link]\n  It should be pretty trivial to add a switch or an environment variable to restrict concurrency for the cases where you don&#39;t want it.\n Except you&#39;re changing the default API. You need to add a switch to enable concurrency instead. And then you&#39;re dumping all the cost of this new feature on the people who want improved performance (fine), but who probably won&#39;t realise this option is available ... :-)\n It is funny how it was said that advances in CPU design had hit a wall. You couldn&#39;t increase clock frequency anymore and the only way to squeeze more computing power out of a CPU was to increase the number of cores. But this was a big problem, because it required software to be rewritten to increase parallelism, and we all know the massive inertia built in in the software industry. And now, when someone comes up with a genuine improvement (a language that advertises built-in thread safety), people start complaining that the programs hog the CPU.\n This is not a negligible distinction.  Similarly, Rust does not trap integer overflows (except in signed types in non-release builds, i.e. unit tests), so does not prevent such bugs. Complacency around bugs the Rust compiler permits is encouraged by neglect as part of the Holy Mission to drive Rust into universal enterprise use. (&#34;Rewrite It in Rust&#34; has lately been repudiated as official policy of Rust advocacy, for reasons, but uutils seems to have missed the memo.)  When bugs do trap, such as array indexing errors, the resulting panic cannot be presumed to clean up properly before exiting. This sort of thing is hard to get right, and only comes with maturity. Coreutils probably still have bugs of their own, but they are manifestly bugs we have found we can live with.  All of the core utilities, and many others, could be switched over to build with a C++ compiler and then incrementally modernized with overwhelmingly smaller effort than a wholesale rewrite, at much less risk of introducing new bugs, and without abandoning those targets LLVM poorly serves. No Holy Mission drives such activity, so we see it happen with resounding success in Gcc and Gdb, but not yet in less active projects, or in more hidebound ones like PosgreSQL, SQLite, Git, Systemd, the BSDs, or Linux.  There is more than one way to get memory safety without compromising performance. Rust offers one way. Modern C++ practice, writing at a level of abstraction that confines risky operations to trusted libraries, is another. As such libraries are needed anyway, the cost is small. In effect, one places the trust in such libraries that Rust users place in their compiler and in audited &#34;unsafe&#34; blocks in their corresponding libraries.  It could be seen as tragic when wholly new projects, like Pipewire, Vulkan, and Wayland, are coded in archaic, bug-prone C for no defensible reason; but they can anyway be redeemed starting with a 1-line change to their build script.\n Perhaps if you spent as much time doing this work which you claim is so trivial, rather than slagging off people who are shipping code that I can use, you&#39;d have more of a case.\n Not interested in slagging anyone off, thanks.  Unfortunate choices are unfortunate, including choices that generate unnecessary extra work; but as none of them make extra work for me, I happily coexist. You?\n  &gt; (&#34;Rewrite It in Rust&#34; has lately been repudiated as official policy of Rust advocacy, for reasons, but uutils seems to have missed the memo.)  Or they found the Rust benefits worth it regardless of advocacy. Your scorn is unwarranted.\n If you read scorn, you read wrong.  Rust is manifestly a better language than C for any use where it works at all. But it is not the only, and often enough not the wisest choice. Everyone chooses for their own reasons, and wisdom may come too late, but late is better than never.\n &gt; If you read scorn, you read wrong.  I wasn&#39;t the only who read it that way. Couple of examples:  &#34;Complacency around bugs the Rust compiler permits is encouraged by neglect as part of the Holy Mission to drive Rust into universal enterprise use&#34;  Sounds like a conspiracy with no evidence cited.  &#34;No Holy Mission drives such activity&#34;  Sounds scornful to me. If you didn&#39;t intend to be read that way, you should rephrase these.\n  &gt; But it is not the only, and often enough not the wisest choice. Sadly today they are precisely  one language suitable for writing safe low-level code. Well\u2026 one and half, essentially: Rust and \u201cGCC&#39;s C with set of flags Linus insisted on being added to GCC\u201d. C++ is flat-out unsuitable.\n One?  Did everyone suddenly forget about Ada and it\u2019s sinking Spark? These two have been in use in mission critical work for decades.\n  You are the first simultaneous Rust promoter and C apologist I have encountered. You might be all alone in the world.\n Posted Jun 12, 2021 23:22 UTC (Sat) by  Cyberax ( \u272d supporter \u272d, #52523) [ Link]\n  Why? C is a de-facto systems language (duh), and Rust is the only modern-ish alternative. I believe that C++ can be used as well, but it has way too many drawbacks to justify rewrite of low-level systems in C++.\n  &gt; All of the core utilities, and many others, could be switched over to build with a C++ compiler and then incrementally modernized with overwhelmingly smaller effort than a wholesale rewrite,  Great plan on paper. The reasons why this does not work in practice are well known and have been detailed in about every single article about Rust.  - While much safer than C, even the &#34;most modern&#34; C++ is not as safe as Rust [1]  - Different C++ programmers seem to have different opinions about &#34;modernity&#34; (and everything C++?) &#34;There is more than one way to do it&#34;, famous last words.  - Similarly, there is no simple tool or set of rules to detect unsafe/old C and tell when such a safety effort is &#34;done&#34;.

It used to be that scientists assumed that brain evolution followed a simple pattern, with gradual increase in brain size from our early relatives like Australopithecus africanus some 2.5 million years ago. Over the last twenty years, we\u2019ve gotten a fuller picture of the variability of ancient species in brain size. Understanding the evolution of this variability requires us to look at a broader range of mammals to see how the hominin pattern may compare to other families.\n A new paper in the open access journal  Science Advances finds that other branches of mammals also have more intricate patterns of brain size evolution than once assumed. ( \u201cThe evolution of mammalian brain size\u201d). Scientists have understood for more than a hundred years that brain size has a nonlinear relationship with body mass. The traditional way of understanding how brain size may have evolved differently from body mass within a species is to compare it to the entire array of brain size and body mass across all mammals. The idea is that any species or group of species might be outliers that diverge from the average because of natural selection.\n But mammals are related by a hierarchical tree, and this means that treating species like a random scatter is a bad way to understand their evolution. In their new work, J. B. Smaers and coworkers consider a larger dataset of mammal brain and body masses, and use methods that enable them to navigate the tree of relationships. They find that different branches of mammals have very different constraints and patterns of brain size evolution.\n  Our branch, the hominins, stands out as one of two (the other is cetaceans) that seem overall to have a negative relationship of body and brain size \u2013 that is, brains got bigger across our lineage while bodies got smaller.\n It\u2019s not obvious to me that this is correct when we look across all the hominins. Instead, it looks to me like the  H. erectus\u2013&lt;/em&gt;\u201cH. heidelbergensis\u201d&lt;/em&gt;\u2013 H. sapiens comparison may be driving a superficial appearance that brains get bigger and bodies get smaller. Obviously bigger body size is part of the evolution of some lineages of  Homo, including  H. erectus and  H. sapiens. My view of hominins is that both brain and body size have undergone diverse changes in different lineages. There are enough different branches of the tree that I doubt any simple pattern is going to manifest across the entire hominin group.\n I think there is much more to do in understanding brain size evolution in hominins. The kind of data across the tree of mammals that Smaers and coworkers have provided will be very important to interpreting what has happened to our own lineage.\n UPDATE (2021-04-30): After I posted this, I went to the supplementary data to see what they had included for hominins. As I suspected, the study relies only upon species means of body mass and brain mass for a handful of hominin species, and these means are arrayed in such a way as to support the idea of larger brains and smaller bodies in some species. So for example,  Au. africanus and  Au. afarensis average larger brain mass and smaller body mass than given for  Pan paniscus and  Pan troglodytes, and  H. sapiens and  H. neanderthalensis have larger brain mass and smaller body mass than reported for  H. heidelbergensis.\n I think a proper examination of the variation within these species and the addition of other species would probably eliminate the appearance of negative allometry in the hominins.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 13:16:56", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5ba1\u89c6,body,\u7269\u79cd", "title": "\u8111\u8eab\u4e0a\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u54fa\u4e73\u52a8\u7269 ", "title_en": "Brain-body allometry revisited across mammals", "transed": 1, "url": "http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/brain/brain-body-allometry-smaers-2021.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5ba1\u89c6", "body", "\u7269\u79cd"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "631f69f47a77d7b17beb9f2623866cd2.png", "infoid": 1066650, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5bfc\u5165{dataTypes\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\uff0cpostgresconnector}\u4ece\uff06\uff0339;

", "note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  Alcohol powder or  powdered alcohol or  dry alcohol is a product generally made using  micro-encapsulation. When reconstituted with water,  alcohol (specifically ethanol) in powder form becomes an  alcoholic drink. In March 2015 four product labels for specific powdered alcohol products were approved by the United States Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) which opened the doors for legal product sales. However, as of 4 January 2016, the product is not yet available for sale and legalization remains controversial due to public-health and other concerns.  [1] Researchers have expressed concern that, should the product go into production, increases in alcohol misuse, abuse, and associated physical harm to its consumers could occur above what has been historically associated with liquid alcohol alone.\n    In 1966 \u00a0( ) Sato Foods Industries Co., Ltd. invented alcohol pulverization. Sato is a food additives and seasoning manufacturer in  Aichi Pref., Japan. ( ja:\u4f50\u85e4\u98df\u54c1\u5de5\u696d (\u611b\u77e5\u770c))   [3] A year later, in 1967, Sato began production and sales of various kinds of &#34;high content alcohol powder  Alcock&#34; (&#34;\u9ad8\u542b\u5ea6\u30a2\u30eb\u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u7c89\u672b\u300c \u30a2\u30eb\u30b3\u30c3\u30af\u300d&#34;).  [3]\n On 15 January 1974, a practical manufacturing process for alcohol powder was patented by Sato.  [4]  [5]  [6]  [7] Sato has  patented the process in 17 countries around the world.  [8]  [9]  [10]\n In the 1970s Sato began promoting powdered alcohol in the United States. Test sales began in 1977 under the trade name &#34;SureShot&#34;.  [11]  [12] The product &#34;Palcohol&#34; was announced for future release in the U.S. in 2015.\n  Officially, Sato says that its products are for business use only, for example for the use of food-processing industries or food-and-drink businesses (e.g. restaurant, caf\u00e9,  sweets shop,  bakery shop, etc.). Mainly, its products are to be used as food additives. Other than purposes for test sale, research, etc., it has never been sold for eating or drinking, including personal use or home use.  [9]  [13]\n In June 1982, Sato started production and sales for the drinking powdered alcohol, as test case. Its name is &#34;powdered cocktail  Alcock-Light cocktail&#34; (&#34;\u7c89\u672b\u30ab\u30af\u30c6\u30eb   &#39;\u30a2\u30eb\u30b3\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30ab\u30af\u30c6\u30eb&#39; &#34;).  [3]  [14] At least, during some years, it seems that had continued to test sales.  [15]  [16]\n  Powdered alcohol would generally share the health risks that are associated with traditional liquid alcohol consumption, although there may be some differences in its effects related to differences in consumption potency, differences in characteristics for storage, concealability, and portability, lack of familiarity, and potentially novel delivery methods. Excessive consumption of alcohol can result in acute overdose, intoxication-related accidental injury, compromised judgment, and longer-term negative health consequences including liver disease, cancer, and physiologic dependence.  [17]\n  As with the public health concerns, the following concerns have been posed but data are not yet available to prove or disprove them. Because of the unique characteristics of powdered alcohol, introduction in the U.S. could raise significant concerns from alcohol retailers as it will raise the awareness of their customers health and well as a major priority. including such as restaurants, bars, and sporting venues,  [18] including:\n Availability of powdered alcohol could negatively affect retailers&#39; economic interests as customers might now have the ability to purchase less relatively expensive and safer alcohol from those businesses by augmenting their purchased liquid alcohol drinks with cheaper powdered alcohol mixtures purchased elsewhere.\n Use of powdered alcohol by customers could increase responsibility of these businesses&#39; by increasing the accuracy and abilities to monitor their customers&#39; alcohol consumption - which they are legally required to do to try to prevent the consumption of alcohol by intoxicated or under-age customers. This could hold them at a greater responsibility out of concern of civil-liability lawsuits (because retailers are held liable for alcohol-attributable harms caused by customers who should not have been served alcohol).\n     An auxiliary material for a capsule may be any readily water-soluble substance (e.g.  carbohydrate such as  dextrins ( starch  hydrolyzate),  protein such as  gelatin). For powdered alcohol,  maltodextrin (a type of dextrin) was chosen.\n  In this process, a  mixture of dextrin and alcohol is subjected to simultaneous spraying and heating. The spraying converts the liquid to small drops (up to several hundred  \u03bcm (micrometers) in diameter), and the heat causes the hydrous dextrin to form a film. When the film dries, the drop becomes a microcapsule containing alcohol and dextrin.\n Before and after drying, comparing the amounts of water and alcohol, about 90% of water is removed and about 10% of ethyl alcohol is lost.  [15] One of the reasons which are considered, is the following.\n In mixtures such as this, the speed of molecule movement is dependent on molecule size and  carbohydrate (in this case, maltodextrin) concentration. Water, the smallest molecule in the mixture, is able to move and evaporate fastest. In higher concentration, by decreasing water, water molecules can move much faster. After the film formed it is less permeable to larger molecules than water. By the time the film is completed, water has evaporated enough. This phenomenon is called &#34; selective diffusion.&#34;  [20]\n In general, after sprayed, encapsulation for each drop is completed within about 0.1 second from the very beginning of the process. There is no time for the internal convection in each drop or capsule to occur.  [15]\n Ultimately, large amounts of microcapsules have been produced. These become the powdery matter called powdered alcohol or alcohol powder. According to Sato&#39;s web page, powdered alcohol contains 30.5% ethyl alcohol by volume in the state of powder.  [10]\n In addition to the mixture before drying, if necessary, other additives (e.g. extract, sweetener, spices, coloring matter, etc.) may be added.\n As a result, alcohol powder can be said to be an alcoholic beverage that is &#34; dry&#34;.For example, a &#34;dry  martini&#34; made from alcohol powder may be referred to as a &#34; dry dry martini&#34; or &#34; dried dry martini&#34;.  [11]\n   Typically, when considering the quality of a powdered product such as  coffee,  freeze drying seems to be better than spray drying, but this does not apply to alcohol powder production. In fact, &#34; freeze-dried beer spice&#34; was made by university students for their research.  Carbon dioxide, water and alcohol have all been lost.  [22]\n Due to the  volatility of alcohol, relatively higher than water, time-consuming methods, such as freeze drying, should not be used. By selective diffusion, loss of alcohol is relatively small.\n  In 2014, an article on the website PopSci.com published instructions on how to make pulverized alcohol easily, through a simple mixture of alcohol and dextrin.  [23]\n In this method, the powder is not encapsulated, and also not yet fully dried. Consequently, alcohol continues to evaporate from it very rapidly.\n Due to flaws in the powdered alcohol produced by this method, this form of powdered alcohol was said to be unsuitable for drinking, carrying, or preserving.\n Any production of powdered alcohol without a license is illegal in Japan, even if it is only for personal use, according to the Liquor Tax Act of Japan.\n   Currently, the alcoholic beverage industry in Japan is large and powerful. [   citation needed] [   opinion] For example, in fiscal year 2013,  Suntory, one of the country&#39;s largest beverage companies, recorded sales of 570.7 billion  yen (about US$4.7 billion) in alcoholic beverages, excluding wine  [24] Currently, the sales revenue from powdered alcohol has been too small to affect the sales of liquid-alcohol companies. Additionally, powdered alcohol&#39;s market share is currently too small to be considered as a statistical item in Japanese tax reports.  [25]\n Powdered alcohol is found in some mass production foods, used in small amounts (as are other additives).\n  In 1977, the  Associated Press delivered the first news story in the United States about powdered alcohol, which was then an unprecedented product. Investors were quoted as saying that they &#34;hope[d] to revolutionize the liquor business with a product that&#39;s easy to carry, cheap and potent&#34;. A test sale of powdered alcohol, called &#34;SureShot&#34;, was done in the United States.  [11]  [12]  [26]\n  According to  food chemist Udo Pollmer of the European Institute of Food and Nutrition Sciences in  Munich, alcohol can be absorbed in  cyclodextrins, a synthetic carbohydrate  derivative. In this way, encapsuled in small capsules, the fluid can be handled as a powder. The cyclodextrins can absorb an estimated 60 percent of their own weight in alcohol.  [27] A US  patent was registered for the process as early as 1974.  [28]\n   Nebulizer: Alcohol powder produced through molecular encapsulation with  cyclodextrin can be used with a  nebulizer  [30] though this could be dangerous.\n    Powdered alcohol is illegal in the state of  Victoria, as of 1 July 2015.  [31] As of the Liquor (Undesirable Liquor Product - Powdered Alcohol) Amendment Regulation 2018, made under the Liquor Act 1992, Powdered Alcohol in Queensland was banned and pronounced illegal.  [32] The NSW Government also recognises powdered alcohol an undesirable product under the Liquor Regulation Act 2018.  [33]\n   The product was available in four flavors and packed in 65-gram, or possibly 100-gram, sachets. When mixed with 0.25 liters of water, it created a drink with 4.8% alcohol. It was assumed that a German producer manufactured the  alcopop powder based on imported raw alcohol powder from the U.S.  [34]\n   The Japanese Liquor Tax Act ( ja:\u9152\u7a0e\u6cd5) amendment of April 1981  [36]  [26] classifies powdered alcohol as an alcoholic beverage. In the production of powdered alcohol some non-alcoholic ingredients are added which is similar to some liqueurs. Nonetheless, powdered alcohol became a separate category of alcoholic beverages.\n In May 1981, Sato received the first license to produce alcohol powder commercially. In Japan, powdered alcohol is officially called,  funmatsu-shu  (  ja:\u7c89\u672b\u9152, lit. &#39;powdered-alcoholic beverage&#39;).  [3]Powdered alcohol is defined by law as a &#34;powdery substance that can be dissolved, and can make a beverage containing 1% or more alcohol by volume&#34;.  [37]\n Before the 1981 amendment, powdered alcohol was outside the scope of Liquor Tax, as it is not a liquid.  [14]\n  In 2007, four food technology students in the  Netherlands invented a powdered alcohol product called &#34;Booz2go&#34;.  [38] They claimed that when mixed with water, the powder would produce a bubbly, lime-colored and  lime-flavored drink, with 3% alcohol. When put into commercial production, it was expected to sell for \u20ac1.50 (approx.  US$1.60) for a 20\u00a0gram sachet.\n The product&#39;s creators and marketers \u2013 Harm van Elderen, Martyn van Nierop, and others at Helicon Vocational Institute in  Boxtel \u2013 claimed to be aiming at the youth market. They compared the drink to alcopops like  Bacardi Breezer and said they expected the relatively low alcohol content would be popular with the young segment.\n Because of complexities in Dutch laws, powdered alcohol like Booz2Go would not be subject to the Alcohol and  Horeca Code, because it is not literally an alcoholic drink. This means that anybody of any age could buy it legally. However, when dissolved in water, it would be subject to the Code, according to Director Wim van Dalen of the Dutch National Foundation for Alcohol Prevention. Von Dalen commented that while he generally did not support new alcoholic drinks, he doubted the powder would become attractive. A spokesman of the  Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport said they would not undertake any actions against the product, but added that the label would have to contain a warning about any health risks for the consumer, in accordance with other laws.  [39]\n    According to one Russian news site, in 2009, a Professor at  Saint Petersburg Technological University named Yevgeny Moskalev invented and patented a method of creating alcohol powder. This method could make alcohol powder from any kind of alcoholic beverage.  [41]\n  The method was tested on 96% spirit vodka. In this method, melted wax ( stearic acid) is stirred, and the alcoholic drink is poured in. The solution dissipates and becomes drops containing alcohol and wax. The drops that solidify constitute alcohol powder.\n It was proposed that Moskalev&#39;s powdered alcohol could be wrapped in paper and carried around in a pocket or a bag. In addition, a pill form, containing alcohol, was also made with this method.\n Professor Moskalev responded: &#34;powdered vodka tastes like a candle&#34;; &#34;I did not like vodka in pills&#34;; and, in conclusion, &#34;vodka is best consumed the old way&#34;.\n  In 2008, Pulver Spirits began developing a line of alcohol powder products to be marketed in the United States. The marketing was reportedly intended to be in full compliance with alcohol regulations and targeted at adults of legal drinking age.  [42]\n In Spring 2014, the Arizona-based company Lipsmark LLC announced that it would start marketing powdered alcohol under the name &#34;Palcohol&#34;, a  portmanteau of  powder +  alcohol.  [43] This caused considerable controversy, after the product was approved by the TTB for sale. This approval was later attributed to a &#34;labeling error&#34;, and the manufacturer surrendered the approvals.  [44]\n In March, 2015, the U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) approved four powdered alcohol products with the brand name &#34;Palcohol&#34; for sale in the U.S.  [45] Under the  Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution, state and territory governments also have substantial regulatory powers over &#34;intoxicating liquors&#34;, especially regarding retail sales and sales to minors.  [46] Shortly after the TTB approval was announced, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) responded to inaccurate reports implying that it had approved powdered alcohol as being safe. The FDA clarified that its role was to evaluate the nonalcoholic ingredients and that based on its evaluation of specific powdered alcohol products it had no legal basis to block their entry into the U.S. market.  [47]\n In 2014, Ohio state legislators introduced legislation that would ban Palcohol and all other powdered alcohol.  [48] The following year, Iowa state legislators followed suit.  [49]\n  On 25 March 2015, alcohol wholesalers and distributors in the state of Maryland announced an agreement to voluntarily ban the distribution and sale of powdered alcohol.  [51] Concerns included the potential for abuse by minors, the ease of using the powder to bring alcohol into public events or to  spike drinks, and the potential to  snort the powder. At the same time, a bill to ban Palcohol for one year was under consideration in the Maryland House of Delegates.\n  By November 2015, most states had introduced legislation and laws to regulate or ban powdered alcohol. Twenty-seven have banned powdered alcohol, 2 more have placed temporary 1-year bans on the product and 3 have included powdered alcohol under their statutory definitions of alcohol meaning that it is covered by existing alcohol regulations.  [53] [   needs update]\n  The legal status of powdered alcohol in United Kingdom is uncertain, although parliament saw no dangers from the sale of powdered alcohol, aside from the loss of tax revenue.  [54] In a January 2015 answer to a  parliamentary question,  Lord Bates wrote &#34;The Government is aware of powdered alcohol from media reports and the banning of the product in five states of the United States of America. The Government is aware of powdered alcohol being marketed and made available in the coming years to buy in England and  Wales.&#34;  [55]\n  ^     a     b     c     d   \u6709\u4fa1\u8a3c\u5238\u5831\u544a\u66f8(Financial statement) ( in Japanese) Sato Foods Industries Co., Ltd.

Let&#39;s run through interesting parallels between the two, and how you can apply some lessons from improv to build better product.\n Improv comedy is a kind of theatre where performers create unscripted scenes based on prompts from the audience. I&#39;ve been doing improv for 3 years and I often catch myself thinking that the framework used in improv applies to product pretty well.\n   The base reality in any improv scene is the &#34;who, what, where&#34; of the characters on stage. For example, a base reality could be two friends (who) having lunch (what) in a park (where). When you&#39;re on stage with eyes peered on you, there&#39;s a natural  rush to be funny but we need to resist. The base reality needs to be laid first and in fact, it doesn&#39;t need to be funny. It needs to be clear and serve as a neutral background for the funny things to contrast against.\n The key product lesson is that you should understand the world you are in before you do anything else. This is the base reality of your product. Who are your customers? What are their problems? What do they do about these problems? What part of the existing solutions will you  not change? Resist the natural  rush to be creative with features, designs, engineering  - and first observe and understand your base reality. The base reality  shouldn&#39;t be innovative and you should be careful about contriving it to be what you wish. Be specific and truthful. Here are some examples of base realities.\n   Once a base reality is established, improv performers look to find  the game. This is the  unusual thing that stands out, and everything funny revolves around. It&#39;s really important for improvisers to explicitly  frame the game (with a shocked reaction, a confused question, a dramatic pause and so on) so everyone (including the audience) understands what&#39;s unusual.\n In this sketch, the line &#34;Are there any women here today?&#34; explicitly frames the unusual thing. There are indeed women dressed as men.\n It&#39;s similarly really important that you pause and get explicit about your product  game. Be clear and aligned as a team about your unusual insights and beliefs. These will likely be your most critical assumptions and form the basis of your innovation. Your insight could be a specific take on the problem, the technical approach, the distribution, the trends in the space, and so on. Here&#39;re some examples.\n   There&#39;s a natural tendency in improv to bring in  lots of  games because we&#39;re afraid about  not being funny enough. However, the funniest scenes are funny not because they have multiple games, but because they take a focused game to places no one (even the performers) expects. Improvisors do just that by exploring the game (&#34;if this is true, why is it true?&#34;) or heightening it (&#34;if this is true, what else is true?&#34;).\n In this sketch, the game is constant disagreement, and that&#39;s it. Everything else is totally normal.\n This is an important lesson with product too. Resist the temptation to bring in  lots of games because you want to  hedge your bets or because  it all looks exciting. Do less, and take it places no one (including you) can expect. Wonder &#34;why&#34; to explore the deeper rationale behind your key insights and reason from first principles. Wonder &#34;what else&#34; to heighten your key insights by deducing second (and n) order impact and peripheral ideas.\n  Some improv scenes are initiated with a generic line and performers extract the game organically. e.g. &#34;I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s midnight&#34; is an intriguing start to a scene but there&#39;s no obvious game. In contrast, some improv scenes are initiated with strong game right away. e.g. initiating the scene with &#34;No, you&#39;re an accountant, you can&#39;t just become a lion tamer&#34;. Both ways can lead to hilarious scenes.\n Likewise, some products are initiated with a rough idea. This is in the camp of  Eric Reis&#39; model, where you&#39;re lean, get feedback, and iterate quickly. The idea is to treat the path to product market fit as a series of experiments with hypotheses. In contrast, there is  Keith Rabois&#39; model, where you have a strong vision from day 0 and not much changes from then. The idea is that you have a master plan from the start, and you get heads down on executing it. Check this  post by Casey Winters comparing these models with far more nuance.\n Of course, ideally you should find your product game  as soon as possible to leave more room to explore or heighten. However, you shouldn&#39;t use not knowing your game from day 0 as an excuse to to not get started. You should start building your base reality  today and see what surfaces. OpenDoor succeeded with strong initial premise, but Slack and Segment discovered their game over time.\n  There are a few things we can learn from improv to build better product.

We plan to pick classics from the field of mathematics and computation, and read them together. The books and literature we pick for reading are of slightly offbeat nature, hence the name of this club! Our focus is on picking reading material about concepts and technologies that have been around for a long time and have an air of timelessness around them.\n  In particular, we will not be chasing the latest trends in technology most of the time. But we are not a retrocomputing club either. For example, we are likely not going to talk about BASIC programming on Commodore 64. The topics we pick for our club meetings are largely going to be topics that are still quite relevant and important in the field of mathematics and computation but they may not be what is considered to be mainstream. For example, we will read books like  Introduction to Analytic Number Theory or talk about Common Lisp programming. Sometimes these topics may intersect with modern trends or retrocomputing but most of the times they would not. That is the kind of sweet spot we want to hit.\n    Here is a little bit of history about our community. This community was born on the Freenode IRC network when I announced on the  ##algorithms and  ##math channels there that I would be hosting book club meetings on analytic number theory. I created a makeshift channel named  #susam to discuss the book club activities and plan the meeting schedule. Several members joined this channel and the book club was formed.\n  Our first meeting occurred via IRC on 4 Mar 2021. We realized that it would be much more efficient to discuss mathematics via audio along with a shared desktop session where we can use some software tool to scribble out and render mathematics formulas using LaTeX. So on the next day, that is, on 5 Mar 2021, we had our first web meeting via Zoom. Later, after  an announcement on Hacker News, some members from the Hacker News community joined our club too and the community grew a little bit more as a result.\n  During the web meetings in the initial days of this club, I hacked up a tiny non-WSYIWYG tool that helped in typing out LaTeX code quickly and have it rendered on a pane using MathJax. This helped us to scribble mathematics quickly while understanding the concepts we came across in the book. This tool continued to evolve with our book club and it was soon released as  Muboard. We use it often during our meetings.\n    We moved to Libera IRC later and continued to operate out of a makeshift channel. It has now been more than 3 months since we began these meetings. Although our community is tiny, the meetings have been going on consistently and we have learnt numerous new and interesting concepts and theorems in the field of analytic number theory. After 3 months of successful meetings, today, that is, on 15 Jun 2021, I decided to create a more permanent place for our community with a name that represents our community better. This new community is now called the  Offbeat Computation Club. I believe this new name represents the nature of our community and our meetings.\n  In this community, we pick classics from the field of mathematics and computation and read them together. We are now operating out of the  #offbeat channel on Libera IRC.\n    Since this club began, we have made good progress with the study of analytic number theory. The meetings for this topic have been going on consistencly. I have a little more free time now, so I can add a few more parallel meetings on other topics. Emacs and Lisp are on the top of my mind. I will plan something out and post an update soon. In the meantime, if any community member is interested to host their own book club meetings, we will have them added too to our schedule.\n    Join our channel  #offbeat on Libera Chat and be a part of our club activities. Alternatively, you can also join our channel via its Matrix bridge at  #offbeat:libera.chat. Both the channel link and the bridge link point to the same channel, so you need to join only one of them, not both. If you are not an active IRC user, prefer joining the Matrix bridge because it is more convenient for someone unfamiliar with IRC.

The fintech company has raised more than $60 million in equity funding since its founding in 2013. Splash was previously known as GradSchoolLoans until a rebranding in 2016.\n The firm said the Series B round was led by partners of DST Global, Citi Ventures, Detroit Venture Partners and Firebolt Ventures, as well as existing investors CMFG Ventures and Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures.\n Splash founder and CEO Steven Muszynski said the investment will help expand the platform&#39;s lending network and automated underwriting platform. Both are critical pillars of the business, which features a hybrid marketplace model whereby users can shop for and compare rates when looking to refinance their loans.\n &#34;I think this shows the confidence our investors have in what we&#39;re doing in trying to help people shop and save money when it comes to their financial goals,&#34; Muszynski said. &#34;I think as the world is opening up post-COVID, and as companies are trying to expand and grow quickly, raising this level of capital provides greater opportunity for faster expansion, whether that&#39;s expanding the team with talent or consumer marketing, or expanding products and lending partners. The money just allows you to do a lot to be able to make a large impact in the space.&#34;\n  Muszynski declined to share details of the current revenue picture. However, the firm did tell Crain&#39;s in December its monthly revenue had  spiked 2,150% over the prior 18 months.\n That&#39;s noteworthy considering the pause in collections for many student loans during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 the idea being that fewer people might turn to refinancing when their payments are delayed, thereby decreasing its potential market of users.\n  &#34;We continue to see significant growth. And I think there is a mass shift in consumer behavior where they want to shop and save from their homes,&#34; he said, referencing the accelerated adoption of digital banking during the pandemic. &#34;We have some major tailwinds propelling this industry forward.&#34;\n Building on its offerings, Splash this month launched a network of lenders for borrowers still in school. Muszynski said the company plans to unveil other lending products in the coming months.\n The outlook for this business excites Splash investors and others looking for a piece of the student loan refinancing industry.\n Among many playing in this space, Cleveland&#39;s KeyBank, for instance, in 2019  acquired Laurel Road, a student loan refinancing platform that specializes in borrowers in the health care field (like doctors and dentists). Key has seen strong revenue from Laurel Road, which is one of Splash&#39;s many partners, and this spring expanded the platform into a  digital affinity bank for health care workers, offering additional lending products.\n &#34;The importance and sophistication of digital lenders is growing apace,&#34; said Charley Howe, director of venture investing at Citi Ventures, in a statement. &#34;Splash Financial is spearheading a digital transformation strategy that will meet the new demands of consumers. We see significant growth potential in the continued evolution of the lending experience, and we are thrilled to support Splash&#39;s next phase of growth.&#34;\n Splash has about 120 employees. About 60% of those are working out of Cleveland, with others spread out and working remotely from other parts of the country. Muszynski anticipates doubling the total workforce over the next 12 months.\n This fundraise by Splash likely will be among the largest venture capital deals this year in Northeast Ohio.\n According to  data compiled by PwC and CB Insights, the largest VC deal in Northeast Ohio in 2020 went to  Within3 of Lakewood, which raised $100 million in the third quarter. The next largest in this market after that went to  Neuros Medical of Willoughby, which raised $42.8 million in the fourth quarter.\n The largest VC deal in the state last year came with Columbus&#39;  Olive, which raised $382.5 million over three rounds in 2020.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 11:08:29", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8d37\u6b3e,led", "title": "Splash Financial\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u4ece\u4e8b\u5b66\u751f\u8d37\u6b3e\u518d\u878d\u8d44\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u8d37\u6b3e\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7531DST\u5168\u7403\uff0c\u82b1\u65d7\u4f01\u4e1a\u548c\u66f4\u591a\u7684B\u9886\u5bfc44.3M\u7cfb\u5217B.

", "note_en": "The recent ransomware attacks on Colonial Pipeline and the meat processing giant JBS, both attributed to Russian cybercrime gangs, as well as the SolarWinds espionage campaign that intelligence agencies linked to Moscow, thrust cybersecurity into the spotlight on Capitol Hill and prompted renewed scrutiny of the challenges facing the federal government, including its limited understanding of attacks on private companies.\n Washington is slowly responding to the crisis. In mid-May,  Biden signed an executive order intended to close federal security gaps and increase oversight of the contractors that often serve as backdoors into agency networks. Two weeks later,  the TSA issued a security directive requiring pipeline operators to report cyberattacks.  A bipartisan group of senators is now planning legislation to require a wide range of businesses to report breaches.\n Inglis\u2019 new White House office was one of several policy reforms recommended by the congressional chartered Cyberspace Solarium Commission and incorporated into the fiscal 2021 defense policy bill. Lawmakers envisioned the office as analogous to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in terms of elevating the importance of cyber issues within the White House.\n But Congress did not define Inglis\u2019 exact portfolio or authorities, and it remains unclear how he will work with Anne Neuberger, Biden\u2019s deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology. During the presidential transition,  Biden aides bristled at Congress\u2019 creation of a new Senate-confirmed White House position and argued unsuccessfully that cyber coordination should remain the domain of the National Security Council.\n But many on the Hill wanted more continuity and stability in the White House\u2019s approach to cyber issues. The Obama administration had created a cyber coordinator position inside the NSC, but the Trump administration had eliminated that role, calling it unnecessary. That move generated a fierce backlash and led to the Solarium Commission developing the contours of the national cyber director office.\n Inglis, who served on the Solarium Commission, became an early frontrunner for the position. An Air Force veteran who spent nearly 30 years at the NSA, including serving as its deputy director from 2006 to 2014, Inglis developed strong relationships with key lawmakers and earned bipartisan respect on Capitol Hill.\n \u201cHe has a quiet but persuasive leadership style,\u201d Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), a Solarium Commission co-chair, said during Inglis\u2019 confirmation hearing. \u201cAll of us have been in meetings where there\u2019s one person, when they begin to speak, you lean over and say, \u2018Now, what are they going to say? Because this is going to be important.\u2019 That\u2019s Chris Inglis.\u201d\n Inglis\u2019 supporters have described him as well-prepared to face his biggest challenges. While he will not control the military operations of U.S. Cyber Command or the spying activities of the NSA from his White House post, he is deeply familiar with how both organizations work, having helped oversee the launch of Cyber Command, which is run by the same official who heads the NSA.\n And while Inglis\u2019 military background created some controversy when his name first surfaced as a candidate for cyber director \u2014 a role that will now be his first civilian government assignment \u2014 his six and a half years as a partner at the private equity firm Paladin Capital Group offered him a front-row seat to the growing cyber threats facing U.S. businesses. That experience could serve him well as he seeks to streamline how the federal government helps the private sector combat hackers.\n With his mandate largely undefined, Inglis will have a unique opportunity to shape the role of the cyber director.

Of these, one of the most impressive was  Elasmotherium sibiricum.\n  Weighing up to 3.5 tonnes, it lived on the Eurasian grasslands ranging from southwestern Russia and Ukraine to Kazakhstan and Siberia.\n Eventually the species went extinct - but exactly when that happened has been in doubt.\n For those studying the fauna of the last Ice Age, one of the most significant events of the period was the megafaunal extinction. It saw the disappearance of many large, iconic species such as the woolly mammoth, the Irish elk and the sabre-toothed cat.\n Prof Adrian Lister, Merit Researcher at the Museum, says, &#39;This megafaunal extinction event didn&#39;t really get going until about 40,000 years ago. So  Elasmotherium with its apparent extinction date of 100,000 years ago has not been considered as part of that same event.&#39;\n Over the last few years, however, there have been some hints that this extinction date for  E. sibiricum might be wrong.\n &#39;We dated a few specimens - such as the beautiful complete skull we have at the Museum - and to our surprise they came in at less than 40,000 years old,&#39; explains Adrian.\n  On its own this did not mean much, but by teaming up with researchers from the Netherlands and Russia, many more fossils were sampled. The researchers, who originally had not a single radiocarbon-dated  Elasmotherium fossil, ended up with 23 dated specimens.\n &#39;They very strongly all confirmed that this species survived until at least 39,000 years ago, and maybe as late as 35,000 years ago,&#39; says Adrian. The results have been published in  Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution.\n  Elasmotherium sibiricum was a true Ice Age giant, weighing up to twice as much as a modern rhino.\n Unusually, despite its massive size and prominent shoulder hump, it is thought that the Siberian unicorn was actually adapted to running at speed.\n &#39;The rhino&#39;s anatomy suggested that it lived in pretty open, grassy plains, grazing almost entirely on grass,&#39; explains Adrian. &#39;Its unusual teeth look very strongly adapted for that kind of grazing as well.&#39;\n By studying the stable isotope ratios in the rhino&#39;s teeth, which involves looking at the levels of different carbon and nitrogen isotopes and then comparing them to different plants, the researchers were able determine what the animals were eating. The results confirm that the Siberian unicorn was most likely grazing on tough, dry grasses.\n  &#39;Modern rhinos tend to be rather solitary and spread out in their habitat,&#39; says Adrian. &#39;Combined with  Elasmotherium&#39;s restricted geographical range, it might have been quite a rare animal.&#39;\n  This natural scarcity may have been one of the factors that tipped the Siberian unicorn into extinction some 39,000 years ago, around the same time that  Neanderthals went extinct and some time before cave bears and spotted hyenas were last seen in Europe.\n This means that the animals would have been sharing Eurasia with both modern humans and Neanderthals, but as Adrian explains, it is unlikely that they were hunted into extinction.\n &#39;There is no evidence at all that people had anything to do with it. You can&#39;t rule it out, but we don&#39;t have any archaeological association of this animal with people in any way at any sites known so far,&#39; he says.\n Instead it is much more probable that their extinction was the result of the dramatic fluctuations in climate that were occurring during this time period, coupled with the specialised grazing lifestyle and low population numbers.\n &#39;The environment where the animal was living seems to have changed quite considerably around the same time it went extinct,&#39; explains Adrian, &#39;so it is quite plausible that if it were a rare animal to start with then it would have been at a relatively high risk of extinction.&#39;\n  Finally, Adrian&#39;s colleagues in Australia were able to extract DNA from some of the fossils, the first time any DNA has ever been recovered from  E. sibiricum.\n This has helped to settle a debate about where the Siberian unicorn, along with all other members of the  Elastrotherium genus, fit on the rhino evolutionary tree.\n It turns out that the ancient group split from the modern group of rhinos roughly 43 million years ago. This means that the Siberian unicorn was the last species of a highly distinctive and ancient linage when it went extinct on the Eurasian plains only a few tens of thousands of years ago.",

control laws \u2014 and prohibits state and local cooperation with enforcement of those laws.\n  Gov. Mike Parson signed  the bill, known as HB 85 or the Second Amendment Preservation Act,  into law Saturday at a gun store and shooting range called Frontier Justice.\n  The law declares federal laws and regulations &#34;that infringe on the people&#39;s right to keep and bear arms as guaranteed by the Second Amendment ... must be invalid in this state.&#34;\n  Parson, a Republican,  said in a press release that the legislation &#34;draws a line in the sand and demonstrates our commitment to reject any attempt by the federal government to circumvent the fundamental right Missourians have to keep and bear arms to protect themselves and their property.&#34;\n      &#34;They can pass a law that says that there are 46 planets, they can pass a law that says that there are 16 days in the week. It doesn&#39;t make it so,&#34; says  Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law and an expert on federal courts and constitutional law. &#34;It has no effect legally because the Constitution specifically says you can&#39;t do that.&#34;\n    &#34;If I am a resident of Missouri, I am no less subject to federal gun laws today than I was yesterday,&#34; Vladeck tells NPR.\n    The U.S. Constitution&#39;s  Supremacy Clause essentially says federal law is supreme over state law. And  the preemption doctrine means that &#34;valid federal law will always displace a state law, even a state constitutional provision that is inconsistent with that federal law,&#34; Vladeck says.\n  He notes that after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, some states passed laws that said the ACA wouldn&#39;t apply in those states. But that hasn&#39;t stopped the ACA from being the law of the land in every state.\n  So, what sort of federal gun laws are there? There are limits on what kinds of guns you can sell across state lines, and limits on what kind of guns and accessories can be sold in the first place. There are federal background check requirements. One provision  bans the possession of firearms by individuals convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. And there are laws governing the process and substance of gun sales, Vladeck says.\n  The new law doesn&#39;t change the liability of people in Missouri or exempt them from federal laws. So if you&#39;re a Missouri gun shop owner, you&#39;re still required to uphold federal background check requirements and other federal laws, even if the governor suggests otherwise.\n    Vladeck views Missouri&#39;s new law as symbolic public relations stunt. But he says it&#39;s symbolism that can be harmful: &#34;You run the risk that the state officials are actually sending a message to their constituents that is just incorrect, and that is exposing them to legal liability that they may not otherwise realize.&#34;\n  &#34;A Missouri gun store that thinks all of a sudden it can stop complying with federal law is going to receive a pretty unpleasant visit from federal authorities,&#34; Vladeck says.\n      While states can&#39;t invalidate federal law, they  can decide the extent to which they assist federal law enforcement.\n  &#34;Under the 10th Amendment, states do have the right to withhold the use of their resources to enforce federal laws,&#34; says  Allison Anderman, senior counsel at Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n  &#34;We&#39;re just simply saying we&#39;re not going to lift a finger to enforce their rules,&#34; Missouri state Sen. Eric Burlison, a Republican, said of the bill last month,  according to  The Kansas City (Mo.) Star.\n  In addition to claiming to invalidate federal gun laws, Missouri&#39;s new law prohibits state and local cooperation with enforcement of those laws. Agencies whose officers knowingly enforce federal gun laws could be hit with fines of $50,000 for each violating officer.\n  State and local officers are not usually tasked with going out and enforcing federal law, Vladeck says \u2013 usually it happens in an ancillary fashion: &#34;If they&#39;re conducting a search of a home because of probable cause of a state crime, they might also find evidence of a federal crime that they&#39;ll refer to federal authorities.&#34;\n  Whether local law enforcement in Missouri will do that when it comes to guns is now in question.\n  The Department of Justice sent a letter on Wednesday night to Parson and Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, warning that the state&#39;s law could damage the working relationship between local and federal authorities, The Associated Press  reported. Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton asked Parson and Schmitt to clarify the law and how it would work by Friday.\n  A spokesperson for the Justice Department confirmed the accuracy of the AP&#39;s report. NPR has not viewed the letter.\n  NPR asked the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives whether the statute would have an impact on its enforcement in the state, but an ATF spokesperson said the agency does not comment on local or state firearms law.\n    Missouri has one of the country&#39;s  highest rates of gun deaths per capita, and  weak gun control laws.\n  The law could have a chilling effect on law enforcement officers&#39; actions when it comes to guns, even if its provisions are unconstitutional and confusing, Anderman says.\n  &#34;There is a tremendous amount of ambiguity in this bill as to what would constitute a violation, and that may inhibit law enforcement from taking action that is needed to protect the community,&#34; she tells NPR.\n  Say an officer encounters someone who has a felony conviction and is in possession of a firearm?\n  &#34;They may not refer that case to federal law enforcement out of fear that they would be liable for a $50,000 fine. And that in turn can result in lack of prosecution of a law that is intended to keep guns out of the hands of people who have committed society&#39;s most serious crimes,&#34; Anderman says.\n  The state is not alone in considering this kind of legislation. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson  said in April he would sign a similar bill approved by the Legislature there.\n  Other states are considering legislation to nullify federal gun laws. But Missouri&#39;s law, Anderman says, will have real-life consequences \u2014 whether or not any law enforcement officers are actually prosecuted and fined.\n  &#34;How many officers have failed to take some action that they might have otherwise taken because of this law? We will likely never know the answer,&#34; she says, &#34;but it&#39;s the deterrent effect that is so concerning.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-18 11:07:14", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

Authority is headquartered in Kingston, Jamaica, in a building that looks a bit like a prison and a bit like a Holiday Inn. The I.S.A., which has been described as \u201cchronically overlooked\u201d and is so obscure that even many Jamaicans don\u2019t know it exists, has jurisdiction over roughly half the globe.\n Under international law, countries control the waters within two hundred miles of their shores. Beyond that, the oceans and all they contain are considered \u201cthe common heritage of mankind.\u201d This realm, which encompasses nearly a hundred million square miles of seafloor, is referred to in I.S.A.-speak simply as the Area.\n  Scattered across the Area are great riches. Mostly, these take the shape of lumps that resemble blackened potatoes. The lumps, known formally as polymetallic nodules, consist of layers of ore that have built up around bits of marine debris, such as ancient shark teeth. The process by which the metals accumulate is not entirely understood; however, it\u2019s thought to be exceedingly slow. A single spud-size nugget might take some three million years to form. It has been estimated that, collectively, the nodules on the bottom of the ocean contain six times as much cobalt, three times as much nickel, and four times as much of the rare-earth metal yttrium as there is on land. They contain six thousand times as much tellurium, a metal that\u2019s even rarer than the rare earths.\n The first attempts to harvest this submerged wealth were undertaken nearly fifty years ago. In the summer of 1974, a drillship purportedly belonging to Howard Hughes\u2014the Hughes Glomar Explorer\u2014anchored north of Midway Atoll, ostensibly to bring up nodules from the depths. In fact, the ship was operated by the C.I.A., which was trying to raise a sunken Soviet submarine. But then, in a curious twist, a real company called Ocean Minerals leased the Glomar to collect nodules from the seabed west of Baja California. The president of the company likened the exercise to \u201cstanding on the top of the Empire State Building, trying to pick up small stones on the sidewalk using a long straw, at night.\u201d\n After the Glomar expeditions, interest in seabed mining waned. It\u2019s now waxing again. As one recent report put it, \u201cThe Pacific Ocean is the scene of a new wild west.\u201d Thirty companies have received permits from the I.S.A. to explore the Area. Most are looking to slurp up the nodules; others are hoping to excavate stretches of the ocean floor that are rich in cobalt and copper. Permits to begin commercial mining could be issued within a few years.\n Proponents of deep-sea mining argue that the sooner it starts the better. Manufacturing wind turbines, electric vehicles, solar panels, and batteries for energy storage requires resources, often scarce ones. (Tellurium is a key component in thin-film solar panels.) \u201cThe reality is that the clean-energy transition is not possible without taking billions of tons of metal from the planet,\u201d Gerard Barron, the chairman of the\u00a0Metals Company, one of the businesses that holds permits from the I.S.A., observed a few months ago. Seafloor nodules, he said, \u201coffer a way to dramatically reduce\u201d the environmental impact of extracting these tons.\n  But seabed mining poses environmental hazards of its own. The more scientists learn about the depths, the more extraordinary the discoveries. The ocean floor is populated by creatures that thrive under conditions that seem impossibly extreme. There is, for example, a ghostly pale deep-sea octopus that lays its eggs only on the stalks of nodule-dwelling sponges. Remove the nodules in order to melt them down and it will, presumably, take millions of years for new ones to form.\n Edith Widder is a marine biologist, a MacArthur Fellow, and the author of \u201c Below the Edge of Darkness: A Memoir of Exploring Light and Life in the Deep Sea\u201d (Random House). Widder is an expert on bioluminescence, a topic that she became interested in after nearly going blind. In 1970, when she was a freshman in college, she had to have surgery for a broken back. The surgery went fine, but afterward she started hemorrhaging. Her heart stopped beating, and she was resuscitated. This happened again, and then a third time. Blood leaked into both of her eyes, blocking her retinas. \u201cMy visual world was swirling darkness with occasional glimpses of meaningless light,\u201d she recalls. Eventually, she regained her vision, but she no longer took sight for granted.\n \u201cWe believe we see the world as it is,\u201d she writes. \u201cWe don\u2019t. We see the world as we need to see it to make our existence possible.\u201d\n The same goes for fish. Only the\u00a0top layers of the oceans are illuminated. The \u201csunlight zone\u201d extends down about seven hundred feet, the \u201ctwilight zone\u201d down another twenty-six hundred feet. Below that\u2014in the \u201cmidnight zone,\u201d\u00a0the \u201cabyssal zone,\u201d and the \u201chadal zone\u201d\u2014there\u2019s only blackness, and the light created by life itself. In this vast darkness, so many species have mastered the art of bioluminescence that Widder estimates they constitute a \u201cmajority of the creatures on the planet.\u201d The first time she descended into the deep in an armored diving suit called a  , she was overwhelmed by the display. \u201cThis was a light extravaganza unlike anything I could have imagined,\u201d she writes. \u201cAfterwards, when asked to describe what I had seen, I blurted, \u2018It\u2019s like the Fourth of July down there!\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n  Bioluminescent creatures produce light via chemical reaction. They synthesize luciferins, compounds that, in the presence of certain enzymes, known as luciferases, oxidize and give off photons. The trick is useful enough that\u00a0bioluminescence has evolved independently some fifty times. Eyes, too, have evolved independently about fifty times, in creatures as diverse as flies, flatworms, and frogs. But, Widder points out, \u201cthere is one remarkable distinction.\u201d All animals\u2019 eyes employ the same basic strategy to convert light to sensation, using proteins called opsins. In the case of\u00a0bioluminescence, different groups of organisms produce very different luciferins, meaning that each has invented its own way to shine.\n The most obvious reason to flash a light in the dark is to find food. Some animals, like the stoplight loosejaw, a fish with photon-emitting organs under each eye, use bioluminescence to seek out prey. Others, like the humpback blackdevil, hope to attract victims with their displays; the blackdevil sports a shiny lure that dangles off its forehead like a crystal from a chandelier.\n Bioluminescence also serves less straightforward functions. It can be used to entice mates and to startle enemies. The giant red mysid, a hamster-size crustacean, spews streams of blue sparkles from nozzles near its mouth; these, it\u2019s believed, distract would-be attackers. Some animals smear their pursuers with bioluminescent slime\u2014the marks make them targets for other predators\u2014and some use bioluminescence as camouflage. This last strategy is known as counterillumination, and it\u2019s used in the twilight zone, where many creatures have upward-looking eyes that scan for the silhouettes of prey. The prey can adjust their glow to blend in with the light filtering down from above.\n Since it\u2019s so hard for humans to get to  the deep sea\u2014and, once there, to record what they\u2019re seeing\u2014Widder has spent much of her career trying to figure out ways to study bioluminescence remotely. She\u2019s developed special deep-sea cameras that rely on red light, which marine creatures mostly can\u2019t detect. Much of \u201cBelow the Edge of Darkness\u201d is occupied with the travails of getting these cameras placed, a project that involves journeys so nauseating that Widder describes cycling through the five stages of seasickness. In the fourth, she explains, \u201cyou\u2019re afraid you\u2019re going to die,\u201d and in the last \u201cyou\u2019re\u00a0afraid you\u2019re not.\u201d\n  The experience that she really wants to convey, though, is not queasiness but wonder. The creatures of the deep have been putting on the world\u2019s greatest\u00a0light show for tens of millions of years. Widder thinks that if people could witness this spectacle\u2014or even just be made aware of it\u2014they\u2019d pay a lot more attention to life at the bottom of the seas and the many hazards that threaten it. These include but are not limited to global\u00a0warming, ocean acidification, overfishing, agricultural runoff, oil spills, invasive species, bottom trawling, plastic waste, and seabed mining.\n  \u201cWe seem to be in a Catch-22 scenario where we haven\u2019t explored the deep ocean because we don\u2019t appreciate what a remarkable, mysterious, and wondrous place it is, and we don\u2019t know what an astonishing place it is because we haven\u2019t explored it,\u201d she argues. Meanwhile, she writes, \u201cwe are managing to destroy the ocean before we even know what\u2019s in it.\u201d\n All marine photosynthesis takes place in the sunlight zone. Beneath that, food is in such short supply that the occasional dead whale that falls to the ocean floor represents a major source of nutrients. Nevertheless, even in the farthest recesses of the oceans, life finds a way.\n The Mariana snailfish, as its name suggests, occupies the Mariana Trench\u2014the ocean\u2019s deepest depression\u2014in the western Pacific. It\u2019s a few inches long\u00a0and looks like a large, pale-pink tadpole. The Mariana snailfish has been found more than twenty-six thousand feet below sea level, where the pressure is eight hundred times greater than at the surface. To survive under such conditions, the snailfish has come up with various ingenious adaptations: its skull is not completely closed, its bones are unusually rubbery, and it produces special chemicals to prevent its proteins from denaturing under stress. The creature can barely see and instead relies on fluid-filled chambers along its jaws, which detect the movements of small crustaceans known as amphipods. Amphipods, for their part, have been collected from the very bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost thirty-six thousand feet down, where the pressure is so great that the animals\u2019 shells, in theory at least, should dissolve. A team of Japanese scientists recently reported that one deep-dwelling amphipod,  Hirondellea gigas, protects its shell by coating it in an aluminum-based gel, produced from metal that it extracts from seafloor mud.\n  Some of the seas\u2019 most extraordinary animals live around hydrothermal vents\u2014the oceanic equivalents of hot springs. Through cracks in the seafloor, water comes in contact with the earth\u2019s magma; the process leaves it superheated and loaded with dissolved minerals. (At some vents, the water reaches a temperature of more than seven hundred degrees.) As the water rises and cools, the minerals precipitate out to form crenellated, castlelike structures. Hydrothermal vents had been theorized about for many years but remained unseen until 1977, when a team of geologists and geochemists travelling on a research vessel called the Knorr located one about two hundred and fifty miles northeast of the Gal\u00e1pagos. A pair of scientists went down to take a look at it in a submersible named Alvin.\n \u201cIsn\u2019t the deep ocean supposed to be like a desert?\u201d one of them asked over Alvin\u2019s phone link.\n   As Helen Scales, a British marine biologist, explains in her new book, \u201c The Brilliant Abyss: Exploring the Majestic Hidden Life of the Deep Ocean, and the Looming Threat That Imperils It\u201d (Grove Atlantic), \u201cthese animals\u201d turned out to be fundamentally different from other creatures. At the bottom of the vents\u2019 food chains are microbes that have come up with their own novel survival strategy. Instead of using photosynthesis, which harnesses the energy of photons, they rely on chemosynthesis, which uses the energy stored in chemical bonds. Since the late nineteen-seventies, Scales reports, researchers have catalogued hundreds of strange species living around vents; they include creatures so puzzling that it\u2019s hard to find a limb for them on the tree of life.\n Yeti crabs, first observed in 2005 on a vent system along the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, south of Easter Island, look like hairy white lobsters. Their \u201chairs\u201d are actually extensions of their shells, and along them live colonies of chemosynthetic bacteria, which the crabs scrape up and consume. Yeti crabs were found to be so evolutionarily distinctive that taxonomists had to create not just a new genus but a whole new family for them.\n Xenoturbella profunda is a creature that looks like a discarded tube sock. First collected from a vent system in the Gulf of California in 2015, it has no intestines or central nervous system, and scientists aren\u2019t even sure what phylum it belongs to.  Chrysomallon squamiferum, commonly referred to as the scaly-foot snail, is a mollusk that\u2019s been found at vents in the Indian Ocean, at a depth of ten thousand feet. It\u2019s the only animal known to build its shell with iron, and around its foot it sports a fringe of iron plates that looks a bit like a flamenco skirt. The snail carries around chemosynthesizing microbes in a special pouch in its throat. In 2019,  Chrysomallon squamiferum became the first vent-dwelling creature to be included on the Red List of Threatened Species, maintained by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The rationale for the listing is that the species has been found at only three sites, and two of these are being explored for mining. Its living space, the I.U.C.N. has observed, is thus apt to be \u201cseverely reduced or destroyed.\u201d\n Scales, like Widder, worries that the bottom of the ocean will be wrecked before many of the most marvellous creatures living there are even identified. \u201cThe frontier story has always been one of destruction and loss,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt is na\u00efve to assume that the process would play out any differently in the deep.\u201d Indeed, she argues, the depths are particularly ill-suited to disturbance because, owing to a scarcity of food, creatures tend to grow and reproduce extremely slowly. \u201cVital habitat is created by corals and sponges that live for millennia,\u201d she writes.\n If deep-sea mining proceeds, it\u2019s likely that one of the first countries to pursue it will be Nauru, a tiny nation that, as it happens, was itself almost destroyed by mining.\n About the size of Block Island, Nauru sits in the South Pacific, about sixteen hundred miles northeast of Papua New Guinea. For thousands of years, the island\u2019s largest visitors were birds, which used it, in the words of one journalist, as a \u201cglorified rest stop.\u201d Polynesians and Micronesians arrived on the island sometime around 1000 B.C. They seem to have lived harmoniously\u2014even idyllically\u2014until gun-toting Europeans showed up, in the early nineteenth century. At the start of the twentieth century, a New Zealander named Albert Ellis realized that the ancient bird droppings that coated the island were a rich source of phosphate, an important fertilizer. During the next six decades, more than thirty-five million tons of phosphate were dug out of Nauru and shipped off to farms in Europe and Australia. The process stripped much of the island bare, leaving nothing but jagged pillars of limestone sticking out of the ground. A  National Geographic photographer who visited Nauru mid-destruction wrote, \u201cA worked-out phosphate field is a dismal, ghastly tract.\u201d\n  In 1968, Nauru became its own country. The phosphate business was still booming, and, on paper, the island\u2019s ten thousand residents became some of the richest people in the world. The new nation used its sovereign wealth to invest in, among other things, cruise ships, airplanes, overseas office buildings, and a London musical based on the life of Leonardo da Vinci. The musical flopped, as did most of the other ventures. Nauruans \u201chave a long history of being taken to the cleaners by crooks\u201d is how Helen Hughes, an Australian economist, put it. In 2001, in return for various fees and payments, Nauru\u2019s government allowed Australia to set up a detention center for refugees on the island. The center soon became infamous for its grim conditions.\n  Today, with the phosphate mostly mined out and the refugees mostly resettled, Nauru is betting on nodules. To engage in deep-sea exploration and mining, a company must be sponsored by a country that\u2019s party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. (The U.S. is one of the few nations that has not ratified the Law of the Sea treaty, because of conservative opposition in the Senate.) Nauru has teamed up with the Metals Company, which is based in Canada, to explore a region of the Pacific known as the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, west of Mexico. \u201cWe are proud that Pacific nations have been leaders in the deep-sea minerals industry,\u201d a statement co-authored by Nauru\u2019s representative to the International Seabed Authority recently declared. The deal, it\u2019s estimated, could eventually bring the country more than a hundred million dollars a year. Alternatively, the arrangement could prove even more disastrous than the da Vinci musical. At one point, Nauru officials expressed concern to the I.S.A. that, if a sponsoring nation were held liable for damages arising from a mining operation, it could \u201cface losing more than it actually has.\u201d\n The I.S.A., for its part, has been assigned the task not just of issuing the permits for seabed mining but also of drafting the regulations to govern the practice. These regulations have yet to be finalized, so it\u2019s unclear how stringent they will be. (The final rules are supposed to be in place before commercial mining commences, though the Metals Company has threatened to try to start without them.) Many marine scientists argue that because deep-sea ecosystems are so fragile\u2014and operations that are miles below the surface so difficult to monitor\u2014the only safe way to proceed is not to. Scales makes this point, but acknowledges that the I.S.A. is unlikely to be swayed. She quotes Daniel Jones, a researcher at the British National Oceanography Centre, who says, \u201cEven if we found unicorns living on the seafloor, I don\u2019t think that would necessarily stop mining.\u201d Meanwhile, assuming that mining does go forward, it\u2019s been suggested that faux nodules could be manufactured and dropped by ship into the deep ocean, to replace those being refashioned into batteries. The perfect vessel for this task would have been the Glomar; unfortunately, a few years ago it was sold for scrap.\u00a0\u2666\n    Sign up for our daily  newsletter to receive the best stories from  The New Yorker.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 11:06:46", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4ee3\u4ef7,sea,\u6d77\u6d0b", "title": "\u6df1\u6d77\u5145\u6ee1\u4e86\u5b9d\u85cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4ee5\u4ee3\u4ef7\u4e3a\u6b62 ", "title_en": "The Deep Sea Is Filled with Treasure, but It Comes at a Price", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/06/21/the-deep-sea-is-filled-with-treasure-but-it-comes-at-a-price", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4ee3\u4ef7", "sea", "\u6d77\u6d0b"]}]
