The software was able to decode information from the BCI to quickly convert the man\u2019s thoughts about handwriting into text on a computer screen.\n The man was able to write using this approach more than twice as quickly as he could using a previous method developed by the Stanford researchers, who reported those findings in 2017 in the journal\u00a0 eLife.\n  The new findings,  published online May 12 in\u00a0 Nature, could spur further advances benefiting hundreds of thousands of Americans, and millions globally, who\u2019ve lost the use of their upper limbs or their ability to speak due to spinal-cord injuries, strokes or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, said  Jaimie Henderson, MD, professor of neurosurgery.\n \u201cThis approach allowed a person with paralysis to compose sentences at speeds nearly comparable to those of able-bodied adults of the same age typing on a smartphone,\u201d said Henderson, the John and Jene Blume \u2014 Robert and Ruth Halperin Professor.&#34;\u00a0The goal is to restore the ability to communicate by text.\u201d\n  A patient with limb paralysis imagined writing letters of the alphabet. Sensors implanted in his brain picked up the signals, and algorithms transcribed them onto a computer screen. | Frank Willett\n The participant in the study produced text at a rate of about 18 words per minute. By comparison, able-bodied people of the same age can punch out about 23 words per minute on a smartphone.\n The participant, referred to as T5, lost practically all movement below the neck because of a spinal-cord injury in 2007. Nine years later, Henderson placed two brain-computer-interface\u00a0chips, each the size of a baby aspirin, on the \u00a0left side of T5\u2019s brain. Each chip has 100 electrodes that pick up signals from neurons firing in the part of the motor cortex \u2014 a region of the brain\u2019s outermost surface \u2014 that governs hand movement.\n Those neural signals are sent via wires to a computer, where artificial-intelligence algorithms decode the signals and surmise T5\u2019s intended hand and finger motion. The algorithms were designed in Stanford\u2019s  Neural Prosthetics Translational Lab, co-directed by Henderson and  Krishna Shenoy, PhD, professor of electrical engineering and the Hong Seh and Vivian W. M. Lim Professor of Engineering.\n Shenoy and Henderson, who have been collaborating on BCIs since 2005, are the senior co-authors of the new study. The lead author is Frank Willett, PhD, a research scientist in the lab and with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve learned that the brain retains its ability to prescribe fine movements a full decade after the body has lost its ability to execute those movements,\u201d Willett said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve learned that complicated intended motions involving changing speeds and curved trajectories, like handwriting, can be interpreted more easily and more rapidly by the artificial-intelligence algorithms we\u2019re using than can simpler intended motions like moving a cursor in a straight path at a steady speed. Alphabetical letters are different from one another, so they\u2019re easier to tell apart.\u201d\n In the 2017 study, three participants with limb paralysis, including T5 \u2014 all with BCIs placed in the motor cortex \u2014 were asked to concentrate on using an arm and hand to move a cursor from one key to the next on a computer-screen keyboard display, then to focus on clicking on that key.\n  In that study, T5 set what was until now the all-time record: copying displayed sentences at about 40 characters per minute. Another study participant was able to write extemporaneously, selecting whatever words she wanted, at 24.4 characters per minute.\n If the paradigm underlying the 2017 study was analogous to typing, the model for the new\u00a0 Nature\u00a0study is analogous to handwriting. T5 concentrated on trying to write individual letters of the alphabet on an imaginary legal pad with an imaginary pen, despite his inability to move his arm or hand. He repeated each letter 10 times, permitting the software to \u201clearn\u201d to recognize the neural signals associated with his effort to write that particular letter.\n In further sessions, T5 was instructed to copy sentences the algorithms had never been exposed to. He was eventually able to generate 90 characters, or about 18 words, per minute.\u00a0 Later, asked to give his answers to open-ended questions, which required some pauses for thought, he generated 73.8 characters (close to 15 words, on average) per minute, tripling the previous free-composition record set in the 2017 study.\n T5\u2019s sentence-copying error rate was about one mistake in every 18 or 19 attempted characters. His free-composition error rate was about one in every 11 or 12 characters. When the researchers used an after-the-fact autocorrect function \u2014 similar to the ones incorporated into our smartphone keyboards \u2014 to clean things up, those error rates were markedly lower: below 1% for copying, and just over 2% for freestyle.\n These error rates are quite low compared with other BCIs, said Shenoy, who is also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.\n \u201cWhile handwriting can approach 20 words per minute, we tend to speak around 125 words per minute, and this is another exciting direction that complements handwriting. If combined, these systems could together offer even more options for patients to communicate effectively,\u201d Shenoy said.\n The BCI used in the study is limited by law to investigational use and is not yet approved for commercial use.\n Stanford University\u2019s Office of Technology Licensing has applied for a patent on intellectual property associated with Willett, Henderson and Shenoy\u2019s work.\n Henderson and Shenoy are members of the  Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute at Stanford and of  Stanford Bio-X.\n Donald Avansino, PhD, a software engineer in the Neural Prosthetics Translational Lab, was a co-author of the study.\n The study\u2019s results are the latest chapter of a long-running collaboration between Henderson and Shenoy and a multi-institutional consortium and clinical trial called BrainGate2 (NCT00912041). Study co-author Leigh Hochberg, MD, PhD, a neurologist and neuroscientist at Massachusetts General Hospital, Brown University and the Veterans Affairs Providence Health Care System in Rhode Island, is the sponsor-investigator of BrainGate2.\n The study was funded by the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the National Institutes of Health (grants UH2NS095548, R01DC009899, R01DC017844, R01DC014034 and U01NS098968), Larry and Pamela Garlick, Samuel and Betsy Reeves, and the Simons Foundation.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 05:58:52", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5927\u8111,brain,\u80fd\u591f", "title": "\u65af\u5766\u798f\u5927\u8111 - \u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u754c\u9762\u6bcf\u5206\u949f\u5b9e\u73b018\u4e2a\u5b57 ", "title_en": "Stanford Brain-Computer-Interface achieves 18 words per minute", "transed": 1, "url": "https://hai.stanford.edu/news/software-turns-mental-handwriting-screen-words", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5927\u8111", "brain", "\u80fd\u591f"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "19c3265d72242479cb8b86fc1aed2b60.jpg", "infoid": 1068121, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u623f\u5c4b\u53f8\u6cd5\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u6279\u51c6\u4e86\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7981\u6b62\u5e73\u53f0\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u50cf\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\uff0c\u82f9\u679c\uff0c\u8c37\u6b4c\u548cFacebook\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u5229\u4e8e\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u548c\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7acb\u6cd5\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u8feb\u4ed6\u4eec\u6d88\u9664\u6216\u51fa\u552e\u67d0\u4e9b\u90e8\u95e8\u6765\u5206\u624b\u884c\u4e1a\u5de8\u5934\u3002\u516c\u53f8\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u9762\u4e34\u5e74\u6536\u5165\u768415\uff05\u7684\u7f5a\u6b3e\u3002\n \u6c11\u4e3b\u515a\u4eba\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7684\u8d26\u5355\u88ab\u200b\u200b\u6279\u51c6\u5728\u4e00\u540d\u542c\u8bc1\u4f1a\u4e2d\u5f00\u59cb\u4e8e\u5468\u4e09\u65e9\u4e0a\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u5468\u56db\u51cc\u66685\u70b9\u51cc\u66685\u70b9\u4f11\u606f\uff0c\u5468\u56db\u65e9\u4e0a\u53c8\u91cd\u65b0\u53ec\u5f00\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0b\u53483\u70b9\u5de6\u53f3\u5b8c\u6210\u3002\u6279\u51c6\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u548c\u6700\u5177\u4e89\u8bae\u7684\u6761\u4f8b\u8349\u6848\u662f\u7ed3\u675f\u5e73\u53f0\u5784\u65ad\u6cd5\u6848\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\uff06\uff0334;\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5e73\u53f0\u5229\u7528\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u4e1a\u52a1\u7ebf\u8def\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u81ea\u7531\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u81ea\u7531\u504f\u597d\u548c\u52a3\u52bf\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c \uff06\uff0334;

Companies could also face fines of 15 percent of their annual revenue.\n Bills introduced by Democrats were approved in a\u00a0 hearing that began Wednesday morning, recessed at 5 am EDT Thursday, reconvened late Thursday morning, and finished around 3 pm.\u00a0The final and most controversial bill approved was the\u00a0 Ending Platform Monopolies Act, which &#34;eliminates the ability of dominant platforms to leverage their control over across multiple business lines to self-preference and disadvantage competitors in ways that undermine free and fair competition,&#34; a  press release from Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) on June 11 said.\n The 21-20 vote went mostly along party lines, but Republicans Ken Buck (R-Colo.) and Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) supported the bill. Democrats who opposed it were Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.); Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.); Lou Correa (D-Calif.); and Greg Stanton (D-Ariz.).\n The bill text says it seeks to &#34;eliminat[e] the conflicts of interest that arise from a dominant online platform&#39;s concurrent ownership or control of an online platform and certain other businesses.&#34; Under the bill text, large platform operators have conflicts of interest when they own or control a separate line of business that creates the incentive and ability to &#34;advantage the covered platform operator&#39;s own products, services, or lines of business on the covered platform over those of a competing business&#34; or &#34;exclude from, or disadvantage, the products, services, or lines of business on the covered platform of a competing business.&#34;\n That could describe Amazon&#39;s online marketplace, Apple&#39;s App Store, or Google search, as those companies use their platforms to pitch their own products in competition with third-party businesses that rely on the giants&#39; platforms to reach users. House Democrats last year issued a  long report outlining their concerns with those companies and Facebook&#39;s &#34;monopoly power in the market for social networking.&#34;\n  The conflicts of interest as defined in the legislation approved today would be illegal if the bill becomes law. A large company would also violate the proposed law if it &#34;offers a product or service that the covered platform requires a business user to purchase or utilize as a condition for access to the covered platform, or as a condition for preferred status or placement of a business user&#39;s product or services on the covered platform.&#34;\n &#34;By operating as both the platform and as a competitor on the platform, these firms often possess an irreconcilable conflict of interest enabling them to harm competition by preferencing their own products and harming rivals,&#34;\u00a0Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.)  said.\n Companies that are found to violate the proposed law would have to terminate the offending service &#34;as soon as is practicable.&#34; They would get a long grace period before any punishment, though, as the amended version of the bill says that companies would\u00a0face civil penalties and lawsuits from US antitrust regulators if they fail to comply &#34;within two years of the [Federal Trade] Commission or Department of Justice designating a covered\u00a0platform.&#34;\n  The separate\u00a0 American Innovation and Choice Online Act\u00a0was approved before the committee went into recess around 5 am. It passed\u00a0in a 24-20 vote and would prohibit conduct that &#34;advantages the covered platform operator&#39;s own products, services, or lines of business over those of another business user; excludes or disadvantages the products, services, or lines of business of another business user relative to the covered platform operator&#39;s own [offerings]; or discriminates among similarly situated business users.&#34;\n Of the 24 aye votes, 21 came from Democrats and three came from Republicans Buck, Gaetz, and Burgess Owens (R-Utah). Democrats Lofgren, Swalwell, Correa, and Stanton opposed the bill.\n The bill &#34;restores competition online and ensures that digital markets are fair and open... by preventing dominant online platforms from using their market power to pick winners and losers, favor their own products, or otherwise distort the marketplace through abusive conduct online,&#34; Nadler  said. He went on to say that &#34;a small set of online platforms have become gatekeepers for much of the digital marketplace,&#34; often leaving businesses and consumers with no &#34;meaningful alternatives.&#34; He said that &#34;these dominant platforms often compete directly against the very businesses that rely on their platform&#34; and that this conduct &#34;eliminates incentives and opportunities for small businesses and entrepreneurs to compete in the digital economy.&#34;\n The bill provides for civil penalties of up to 15 percent of a company&#39;s total revenue over the previous calendar year or up to 30 percent of the company&#39;s US revenue in the offending line of business, whichever is higher. Companies could also face payments of restitution and refunds, &#34;disgorgement of any unjust enrichment,&#34; and injunctions preventing further violations.\n That bill and others greenlighted by the committee must still be approved by the full House. They would also need approval from the Senate, where legislation can be blocked more easily because Democrats do not have a filibuster-proof majority and haven&#39;t taken action to change or eliminate the filibuster. Though the bills passed through the Judiciary Committee, The Wall Street Journal  wrote that &#34;much of the effort faced intensive lobbying by affected firms that slowed the committee&#39;s work and foreshadowed a pitched battle in the Senate.&#34;\n While these bills could benefit Internet users and businesses that need access to online platforms, there has been no similar push in Congress to regulate the  regional broadband-access monopolies that leave users with high monthly bills and little to no choice.\n  Google slammed the legislation, arguing that &#34;American consumers and small businesses would be shocked at how these bills would break many of their favorite services.&#34; Apple is hoping it won&#39;t have to allow installation of iPhone and iPad apps outside of Apple&#39;s App Store,  citing security risks and claiming it would &#34;eliminat[e] choice&#34; because users who want &#34;direct access to applications without any kind of review have sideloading today on other platforms. The iOS platform is the one where users understand that they can&#39;t be tricked or duped into some dark alley or side road where they&#39;re going to end up with a sideloaded app, even if they didn&#39;t intend to.&#34;\n The committee yesterday also approved the  Platform Competition and Opportunity Act. Cicilline&#39;s press release said this proposed law &#34;prohibits acquisitions of competitive threats by dominant platforms, as well [as] acquisitions that expand or entrench the market power of online platforms.&#34; The House committee approved the Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching ( ACCESS) Act, which bill sponsors say &#34;promotes competition online by lowering barriers to entry and switching costs for businesses and consumers through interoperability and data portability requirements.&#34;\n &#34;Facebook would appear to be the target [of the ACCESS ACT], given that social media profiles are basically impossible to port from one network to another,&#34; we wrote in  previous coverage.\n The  Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act was approved and would raise filing fees to give the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission more resources &#34;to aggressively enforce the antitrust laws.&#34; The committee also approved the Republican-sponsored  State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act to  ensure that &#34;state attorneys general are able to remain in the court they select rather than having their cases moved to a court the defendant prefer.&#34;\n  One point of contention between the political parties is whether Microsoft would count as a &#34;covered platform&#34; and have to follow new antidiscrimination regulations.\u00a0&#34;Republicans questioned why the criteria for covered platforms in the legislation appeared tailored to exempt Microsoft,&#34;  Bloomberg wrote. Democrats denied that Microsoft would be exempt.\n The American Choice and Innovation Online Act and other competition bills written by Democrats define &#34;covered platform&#34; as one that has at least 50 million US-based monthly active users and at least 100,000 US-based businesses using the platform, is owned or controlled by an entity with net annual sales or market capitalization greater than $600 billion, and &#34;is a critical trading partner for the sale or provision of any product or service offered on or directly related to the online platform.&#34;\n Rep.

Our close relatives like the Neanderthals and Denisovans clearly interbred both with us and each other. There are also indications that an older African lineage  contributed to our ancestry; Neanderthals seem to have picked up some DNA from an even older lineage as well. All of that makes humanity&#39;s ancestry look more like a river delta, with multiple channels separating and reuniting over time.\n In today&#39;s issue of Science, a group of researchers argue it&#39;s found yet another channel that may sit at a key point in our past. A small collection of bones from a site in the Mideast seems to have a mix of archaic and Neanderthal-like features, suggesting that it may be related to the source of archaic DNA in the Neanderthal lineage. But the bones come from well after the Neanderthal lineage was distinct, and the artifacts found with them suggest extensive interactions with other human lineages.\n  The site is in Israel and is called Nesher Ramla. Extensive dating of materials found there suggests that the newly described bones date from roughly 120,000 to 140,000 years ago. That was, to say the least, a complicated time in our species&#39; history. Neanderthals and Denisovans had already inhabited Eurasia, which they shared with other archaic human lineages, along with  Homo erectus. Modern humans were already present in Africa, which they shared with various archaic lineages, many of which had some modern features. And there is evidence that a lot of these groups were crossing paths in the Mideast.\n The human bones discovered include part of the parietal bones, which form the roof and sides of the skull, and a portion of the jaw. And in many ways, they&#39;re difficult to characterize because they&#39;re a mix of features that are both archaic and found in more recent lineages. An analysis of the parietal bones places their features awkwardly between groups that include  Homo erectus, Neanderthals, and the  Homo lineages that were present in Europe at the time. The bones were distant from modern human remains.\n    The jaw produced similar results, with the new remains perched in between Neanderthals and some of the human lineages present in Europe. In this case,  Homo erectus was a bit more distant, as were other Eurasian human lineages. Imaging of some teeth found separately, along with the roots present in the jaw, provided a bit of additional information.\n  This placement between groups is the product of individual features looking either like those of Neanderthals or those of archaic human lineages. That makes the researchers appropriately hesitant to assign a new species. But they do make the argument that this population was a late survivor of a lineage that goes back to before the origin of Neanderthals and likely contributed to them genetically. That&#39;s an argument that isn&#39;t outrageous given how much we now know about the interbreeding among our ancestors, but it&#39;s still likely to be the subject of debate going forward. (In fact, the arguing  has already started, with at least one paleontologist asserting that the features don&#39;t cleanly distinguish the remains from variation found within Neanderthals.)\n  So, there&#39;s likely to be some arguing over the fossils&#39; anatomic relationships with other human ancestors. But the Nesher Ramla site doesn&#39;t just have bones; there&#39;s also an extensive record of stone tools in the sediment layers. And the structure of these tools indicates they were made via a very specific manufacturing technique. (called the centripetal Levallois method).\n The stone itself comes from the area near the site, indicating that trade wasn&#39;t needed. But the technique used to shape it is very similar to artifacts associated with  Homo sapiens that were found at sites ranging from North Africa to the Arabian Peninsula. This suggests that, whatever species or subspecies they were, the people of Nesher Ramla were likely to be culturally integrated with the other human populations around them\u2014at least to the extent that toolmaking techniques were shared.\n That&#39;s an interesting finding in its own right, but it also serves as a caution. Given the association of this technology with  Homo sapiens, it&#39;s been tempting to use it as a marker for our spread out of Africa. But if the stone technology was readily adopted by archaic populations as well, then the authors argue that we can&#39;t really make the assumption that it travelled with any specific population.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 05:21:45", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5bb6\u5ead,family,\u8868\u660e", "title": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u6811\u4e00\u76f4\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u590d\u6742 ", "title_en": "The human family tree keeps getting more complicated", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/the-human-family-tree-just-keeps-getting-more-complicated/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5bb6\u5ead", "family", "\u8868\u660e"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "020bf62ef0d04fed57ba324ea4ac4dd2.jpg", "infoid": 1068119, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5c71\u7f8a\u96c6\u56e2\u6bcd\u516c\u53f8\u4eca\u5929\u5206\u4eab\uff0c\u5b83\u5df2\u7b79\u96c6\u4e861.95\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u7cfb\u5217\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dF\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u65f6\u5c1a\u5de8\u5934\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u4e3a37\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u52a0\u85aa\u7531\u5c11\u6570\u5bf9\u51b2\u57fa\u91d1\u548c\u516c\u53f8\u516c\u53f8\u9886\u5bfc\uff0c\u5305\u62ecPark West Assuet Management\uff0cFranklin Tearpleton\uff0cAdage Capical Management\uff0cUlysses\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u8d44\u91d1\uff06amp;\u8d26\u76ee\u7531T.

during Amazon Prime Day: eat breakfast, drink water, take breaks, stay positive, and stop for lunch.\n   But following these tips is impossible for many Amazon drivers who aren&#39;t even employed by the company. Amazon delivery drivers face extreme pressure from their contractors, known as Amazon Delivery Partners, who are in turn paid and evaluated by Amazon. In other words, they have to finish their routes as quickly as possible, often under pressure to  circumvent safety rules,  traffic laws, and skip  legally mandated breaks in order to hit delivery targets.\n  &#34;Keep it positive: Endorphins are your friend!&#34; one of the tips on the flyer distributed to Amazon drivers reads. &#34;Keep them flowing by staying on the move, and striking up a conversation.&#34;\n    On Facebook forums, where surviving the Amazon sales event has been a frequent topic of conversation among drivers in recent days, drivers joked about Amazon&#39;s tips.\n  &#34;Take your lunch and breaks. Sure, if you want [your dispatcher] on your ass saying you&#39;re 20 or so stops behind,&#34; an Amazon delivery driver in Los Angeles wrote.\n  &#34;I don\u2019t take a break.
