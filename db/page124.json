", "note_en": "Kredivo is operated by Singapore-based fintech FinAccel. This is the largest loan facility it has raised so far, and is VPC\u2019s biggeast debt commitment to a fintech company outside of the United States and Europe, as well as its only investment in Southeast Asia. Kredivo will use the debt facility to help achieve its goal of serving 10 million customers in Indonesia.\n  Other notable startups that have received debt financing from VPC include  Razor Group,  factory 14,  Konfio and  Elevate.\n Kredivo has more than three million customers and offers two main types of lending products: zero interest 30-day \u2018buy now, pay later\u2019 financing for e-commerce and offline purchases, and three-, six- and 12-month installment loans with an interest rate of 2.6% a month, or a maximum annual rate of 53.36%. Kredivo chief executive officer Akshay Garg told TechCrunch that its \u2018buy now, pay later\u2019 services are typically used for small-value online purchases, while installment loans are used to finance bigger transactions, like laptops, home renovation or medical care.\n While \u2018buy now, pay later\u2019 services like Klarna, Afterpay or Affirm offer convenience to customers in the United States or Europe, in emerging markets it also serves as a tool to build credit, especially in countries that have low credit card penetration, Garg said.\n  \u201cCredit is one of the largest and most complex areas of the financial services ecosystem and the fact is that Indonesia is deeply underserved on that equation,\u201d he said. Most banks only provide secured lending, like home or car loans, and unsecured lending is rare. Garg said there are only eight million credit card holders in Indonesia, which has a population of 270.6 million, and that number has not changed in 13 years.\n One of the reasons for Indonesia\u2019s very low credit card penetration rate is because banks are reluctant to give unsecured loans, especially to younger customers.\n \u201cWhat we\u2019re solving is less a convenience problem and more an access problem. We\u2019re putting unsecured credit, or the ability to buy on credit, in the hands of urban millennials for the first time, simply because banks are just not providing them access to credit cards,\u201d said Garg.\n He added that Kredivo\u2019s effective risk-scoring model allows to charge low interest rates, and its non-performing loan ratio is in the low single-digits, despite the economic impact of COVID-19, which Garg described as a \u201ctrial by fire.\u201d\n Like credit cards from banks, Kredivo also reports customers\u2019 loan histories to Indonesia\u2019s credit bureaus, so they can build credit scores. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is a building Indonesia\u2019s first real digital credit bureau from the ground up, and I think our risk metrics show that this is not just for the sake of some funky innovation, but something that is delivering real performance,\u201d Garg said.\n In a statement, VPC partner Gordon Watson said, \u201cWe have been impressed with the resilience and growth of the business and look forward to deepening our partnership with Kredivo. The company presents a unique combination of growth, scale, risk management and financial inclusion in one of the most exciting emerging markets in the world.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-21 21:30:25", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8d44\u672c,pay,\u8d37\u6b3e", "title": "\u7acb\u5373\u8d2d\u4e70\uff0c\u4ed8\u6b3e\u540e\u6765\u542f\u52a8Kredivo\u5c06\u5176\u503a\u52a1\u5de5\u4e1a\u4ece\u80dc\u5229\u516c\u56ed\u8d44\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u5230200\u7c73 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tBuy now, pay later startup Kredivo doubles its debt facility from Victory Park Capital to $200M\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/buy-now-pay-later-startup-kredivo-doubles-its-debt-facility-from-victory-park-capital-to-200m/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8d44\u672c", "pay", "\u8d37\u6b3e"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "472d26730f32eb781b3bb259f60f8099.jpg", "infoid": 1067200, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u8bb8\u53ef\u97f3\u4e50\u4e3a\u5e7f\u544a\uff0c\u7535\u5f71\uff0c\u7535\u89c6\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u7b49\u7684\u9ad8\u8c03\u540d\u79f0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8fea\u58eb\u5c3c\uff0cNetflix\uff0cApple\uff0cCoca-Cola\uff0c\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u548c\u8c37\u6b4c\u3002\u5b83\u5bc4\u51fa\u6765\u81ea\u5927\u7ea660\u4e07\u97f3\u4e50\u5bb6/\u6b4c\u66f2\u624b\u673a/\u6743\u5229\u6301\u6709\u4eba\u7684\u6b4c\u66f2\u3002\n \u8be5\u670d\u52a1\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\uff0c\u8be5\u670d\u52a1\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6708\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u5b83\u5ba3\u5e03\u6536\u8d2d\u521b\u610f\u673a\u6784\u7684\u5361\u9a6c\u91cc\u7ef4\u65af\u3002\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e00\u5e74\u4e2d\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u6536\u8d2d\u5305\u62ecCuesongs\uff0cSong zu\uff0c\u6912\u76d0\u5377\u997c\u548c\u7a81\u53d1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002\n  \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u8d44\u91d1\u5c06\u8d70\u5411\u66f4\u591a\u7684M\uff06amp;\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u5168\u7403\u4eba\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u603b\u90e8\u4f4d\u4e8eL.A.\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u6b27\u6d32\u548c\u4e9a\u592a\u5730\u533a\u8bbe\u6709\u529e\u4e8b\u5904\u3002\n  \u201cSongtradr\u6b63\u5728\u8fc5\u901f\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u7ee7\u7eed\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5f00\u53d1\u6280\u672f\u7684B2B\u97f3\u4e50\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b0\u6536\u8d2d\uff0c\u201d\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98Paul Wiltshire\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u3002 \u201c\u5438\u5f15\u5982\u6b64\u56de\u5408\u7684\u8fd9\u7c7b\u84dd\u7b79\u80a1\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8d5e\u540c\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u8fc5\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u97f3\u4e50\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u613f\u666f\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u201d ", "note_en": "The platform licenses music to high profile names for advertising, films, TV, gaming and the like, including Disney, Netflix, Apple, Coca-Cola, Amazon and Google.

Other acquisitions made in the past year include Cuesongs, Song Zu, Pretzel and Tunefind.\n  The company says the new funding will go toward even more M&amp;As, new products and an increase in global headcount. The company is headquartered in L.A., but also has offices in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.\n  \u201cSongtradr is rapidly accelerating as we continue to develop our tech-enabled B2B music ecosystem and integrate our new acquisitions,\u201d CEO Paul Wiltshire said in a press release. \u201cAttracting such a blue-chip investor base into this round further endorses our vision of the future music industry in this rapidly evolving digital world, providing a strong foundation for the future.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-21 21:30:11", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name":

", "note_en": "This week twenty-five years ago, Quake broke new ground in game engine realism.It was one of the first commercial games to have fully texture mapped 3D scenesrendered in real-time, with pre-computed lightmaps adding an extra layer ofatmosphere.\n Still, the requirement that the game run in real time on meagre 1996 hardware,placed massive constraints on graphical realism. In this post I want to explorehow the game can be made to look better, with modern hardware and offlinerendering.\n I am going to talk about how I wrote a script for converting Quake demo filesinto Blender scenes.  Blender is a free and opensource 3D modelling and rendering application. Its renderer, Cycles, is apath tracer capable of producing photorealistic imagery, supporting featuressuch as motion blur, depth of field, a comprehensive shader system, and muchmore. By exporting to Blender we get to use all of these features for free,without having to write a new renderer. My objective is to use the originalgame assets as much as possible, while relying on Blender\u2019s accurate lightingsimulation to improve realism.\n Throughout this post I will be linking to the source code, which is part of my pyquake repository. If you want tohave a go at importing your own demos into Blender, I have put together some instructions,but I probably won\u2019t respond to any issues or PRs.I encourage you to make a fork if you are interested in maintaining this project.\n   A demo file is a compact recording of a Quake game, for the purposes of sharingwith other players, or for personal review. Being a multiplayer game, the gameis split into client and server components. The demo is essentially a recordingof the traffic that goes from server to client during the game. Given a demo,and an installation of Quake, it is then possible to reproduce exactly what theplayer saw at the time of recording:\n  Note that even in single player mode, there are still client and servercomponents in the code, with the network layer replaced by a simple memorytransfer, which means demos can be recorded in this setting too.\n Since the demo file format is closely related to the Quake protocol, it can beunderstood by reading the appropriate layer of Quake\u2019s networking code. It isthen relatively straightforward, if a little laborious, to write a parser forthe demo file format in Python.\n When parsed, the demo file can be read a little like a script for a play.

This gives the geometry and textureinformation for the level, along with some other data structures which we willcome onto later. The file format is well documentedand, with a little effort, can be parsed into Python classes. Similarly, themodels which represent things like monsters, weapon models and so on, aredefined in .mdl files, which is also well documented.This project doesn\u2019t handle sound (for the video at the top I simply dubbed arecording from the game), so there is no need to parse sound assets.\n    Blender has a rich Python scripting interface. In fact, Blender\u2019s GUI works byinteracting with a Python API, and so anything that can be done through the UIcan also be scripted. Using this Python interface, I made a script to importthe .bsp files and models parsed above into Blender. For most of the concepts inthe Quake assets there are direct analogues in Blender:\n  My code for importing the parsed .mdl and .bsp files into Blender is here (.mdl)and  here (.bsp).\n Importing the parsed demo consists of reading the intro section to tell us whichgame assets (models and map) to convert into Blender assets, and then animatingthem according to the baseline / update sections. I make use of Blender\u2019sanimation support to do this. More specifically, I insert position,orientation, and shape-key keyframes for every  ServerMessageUpdate command inthe parsed demo. I also keyframe animated shaders such as warping water so thatthey move according to the current game time. Below is a recording showing theresult of importing a demo from the first level in the game. My code forimporting demos files into Blender can be found here.\n   At this point we have our geometry loaded and animated, with some texturesapplied. Still, we are missing light sources. When the Quake levels weredesigned, lights were defined as point light sources scattered throughout thelevel. A compilation process then converts these point light sources into lightmaps. This process works by assigning a low resolution texture to each surfacein the level, and calculating how much each  texel is directlyilluminated by these point light sources.

In addition, our new method enables us to store the qubits for a much longer time, which is milliseconds instead of microseconds \u2014 something that has not been possible before. We are really excited about it,\u201d says Eugene Simon Polzik, professor in quantum optics at the Niels Bohr Institute.\n The special coating of the memory chips makes it much easier to store the qubits of light without big freezers, which are troublesome to operate and require a lot of power.\n Therefore, the new invention will be cheaper and more compatible with the demands of the industry in the future.\n \u201cThe advantage of storing these qubits at room temperature is that it does not require liquid helium or complex laser-systems for cooling. Also it is a much more simple technology that can be implemented more easily in a future quantum internet,\u201d says Karsten Dideriksen, a UCPH-PhD on the project.\n   \u201cIn our memory chips, thousands of atoms are flying around emitting photons also known as qubits of light. When the atoms are exposed to heat, they start moving faster and collide with one another and with the walls of the chip. This leads them to emit photons that are very different from each other. But we need them to be exactly the same in order to use them for safe communication in the future,\u201d explains Eugene Polzik and adds:\n \u201cThat is why we have developed a method that protects the atomic memory with the special coating for the inside of the memory chips. The coating consists of paraffin that has a wax like structure and it works by softening the collision of the atoms, making the emitted photons or qubits identical and stable. Also we used special filters to make sure that only identical photons were extracted from the memory chips\u201d.\n Even though the new discovery is a breakthrough in quantum research, it stills needs more work.\n \u201cRight now we produce the qubits of light at a low rate \u2014 one photon per second, while cooled systems can produce millions in the same amount of time. But we believe there are important advantages to this new technology and that we can overcome this challenge in time,\u201d Eugene concludes.\n Reference: \u201cRoom-temperature single-photon source with near-millisecond built-in memory\u201d by Karsten B.

", "note_en": "We trekked through the Bolivian Amazon, drenched in sweat. Draped head to toe in bug repellent gear, we stayed just ahead of the clouds of mosquitoes as we sidestepped roots, vines and giant ants. My local research assistant Dino Nate, my partner Kelly Rosinger and I were following Julio, one of my Tsimane&#39; friends and our guide on this day. Tsimane&#39; are a group of forager-horticulturalists who live in this hot, humid region. Just behind us, Julio&#39;s three-year-old son floated happily through the jungle, unfazed by the heat and insects despite his lack of protective clothing, putting my perspiration-soaked efforts to shame.\n  We stopped in front of what looked like a small tree but turned out to be a large vine. Julio told us Tsimane&#39; use it when they are in the old-growth forest and need water. He began whacking at the vine from all sides with his machete, sending chips of bark flying with each stroke. Within two minutes he had cut off a meter-long section. Water started to pour out of it. He held it over his mouth, drinking from it for a few seconds to quench his thirst, then offered it to me. I put my water bottle under the vine and collected a cup. It tasted pretty good: light, a little chalky, almost carbonated.\n  As part of my field research, I was asking Julio and other Tsimane&#39; people how they obtain the drinking water they need in different places\u2014in their homes, in the fields, on the river or in the forest. He told me only two types of vines are used for water; the rest don&#39;t work or make you sick. But when he pointed to those other vines, I could hardly tell a difference. The vines are a hidden source of water. Julio&#39;s observations raise a fundamental question of human adaptation: How did our evolutionary history shape the strategies we use to meet our water needs, particularly in environments without ready access to clean water?\n  Here in the forest we were in a relatively water-rich environment, but as we moved away from streams, Julio still knew exactly where and how to get water. Humans are not alone in keeping close track of natural water sources\u2014many animals make mental maps of their surroundings to remember where important resources are found, and some even alter their environments for water. But we are unique in taking much more extreme measures.\n  Throughout history people have drastically engineered their environments to ensure access to water. Take the historic Roman city of Caesarea in modern-day Israel. Back when it was built, more than 2,000 years ago, the region did not have enough naturally occurring freshwater to sustain a city. Because of its geographic importance to their colonial rule, the Romans, through extractive slave labor, built a series of aqueducts to transport water from springs as far as 16 kilometers away. This arrangement provided up to 50,000 people with approximately 145 liters of water per capita a day.\n  Today cities use vast distribution networks to provide potable water to people, which has led to remarkable improvements in public health. When we have plenty of water, we forget how critical it truly is. But when water is precious, it is all we think about. All it takes is news of a shutoff or contamination event for worries about water insecurity to take hold.\n  Without enough water, our physical and cognitive functions decline. Without any, we die within a matter of days. In this way, humans are more dependent on water than many other mammals are. Recent research has illuminated the origins of  our water needs\u2014and how we adapted to quench that thirst. It turns out that much as food has shaped human evolution, so, too, has water.\n      To understand how water has influenced the course of human evolution, we need to page back to a pivotal chapter of our prehistory. Between around three million and two million years ago, the climate in Africa, where hominins (members of the human family) first evolved, became drier. During this interval, the early hominin genus  Australopithecus gave way to our own genus,  Homo. In the course of this transition, body proportions changed: whereas australopithecines were short and stocky,  Homo had a taller, slimmer build with more surface area. These changes reduced our ancestors&#39; exposure to solar radiation while allowing for greater exposure to wind, which increased their ability to dissipate heat, making them more water-efficient.\n  Other key adaptations accompanied this shift in body plan. As climate change replaced forests with grasslands, and early hominins became more proficient at traveling on two legs in open environments, they lost their body hair and developed more sweat glands. These adaptations increased our ancestors&#39; ability to unload excess heat and thus maintain a safe body temperature while moving, as work by Nina Jablonski of Pennsylvania State University and Peter Wheeler of Liverpool John Moores University in England has shown.\n  Sweat glands are a crucial part of our story. Mammals have three types of sweat glands: apocrine, sebaceous and eccrine. The eccrine glands mobilize the water and electrolytes inside cells to produce sweat. Humans have more eccrine sweat glands than any other primate. A recent study by Daniel Aldea of the University of Pennsylvania and his colleagues found that repeated mutations of a gene called  Engrailed 1 may have led to this abundance of eccrine sweat glands. In relatively dry environments akin to the ones early hominins evolved in, the evaporation of sweat cools the skin and blood vessels, which, in turn, cools the body&#39;s core.\n  Armed with this powerful cooling system, early humans could afford to be more active than other primates. In fact, some researchers think that persistence hunting\u2014running an animal down until it overheats\u2014may have been an important foraging strategy for our ancestors, one they could not have pursued if they did not have a means to avoid overheating.\n  This enhanced sweating ability has a downside, however: it elevates our risk of dehydration. Martin Hora of Charles University in Prague and his collaborators recently demonstrated that  Homo erectus would have been able to persistence hunt for approximately five hours in the hot savanna before losing 10 percent of its body mass. In humans, 10 percent body mass loss from dehydration is generally the cutoff before serious risk of physiological and cognitive problems or even death occurs. Beyond that point, drinking becomes difficult, and intravenous fluids are needed for rehydration.\n  Our vulnerability to dehydration means that we are more reliant on external sources of water than our primate cousins and far more than desert-adapted animals such as sheep, camels and goats, which can lose 20 to 40 percent of their body water without risking death. These animals have an extra compartment in the gut called the forestomach that can store water as an internal buffer against dehydration.\n  In fact, desert-dwelling mammals have a range of adaptations to water scarcity. Some of these traits have to do with the functioning of the kidneys, which maintain the body&#39;s water and salt balance. Mammals vary in the size and shape of their kidneys and thus the extent to which they can concentrate urine and thereby conserve body water. The desert pocket mouse, for example, can live without water for months, in part because of the extreme extent to which its kidneys can concentrate urine. Humans can do this to a degree. When we lose copious amounts of water from sweating, a complex network of hormones and neural circuitry directs our kidneys to conserve water by concentrating urine. But our limited ability to do so means we cannot go without freshwater for nearly so long as the pocket mouse.\n  Neither can we preload our bodies with water. The desert camel can drink and store enough water to draw on for weeks. But if humans drink too much fluid, our urine output quickly increases. Our gut size and the rate at which our stomach empties limit how fast we can rehydrate. Worse, if we drink too much water too fast, we can throw off our electrolyte balance and develop hyponatremia\u2014abnormally low levels of sodium in the blood\u2014which is just as deadly if not more so than dehydration.\n  Even under favorable conditions, with food and water readily available, people generally do not recover all of their water losses from heavy exercise for at least 24 hours. And so we must be careful to strike a balance in how we lose and replenish the water in our bodies.\n      There was a reason I was asking Julio about \u201chidden\u201d sources of water, such as vines, that Tsimane&#39; consumed. One evening after dinner a few weeks into my first bout of fieldwork in Bolivia in 2009, the combination of thirst and hunger led me to devour a large papaya. The juices ran down my chin as I ate the ripe fruit. I didn&#39;t think much of it at the moment, but soon after I got into my mosquito net for the night, my error revealed itself.\n  In the Bolivian Amazon, the humidity reaches up to 100 percent at night. Every evening before going to bed I stripped down to my boxers, then rolled my clothes up tightly and put them into large resealable plastic bags so they wouldn&#39;t be soaked the next morning. After about an hour of lying in my mosquito net praying for a gust of wind to cool me off, a dreaded sensation set in: I needed to urinate. Knowing the amount of work it would take to get dressed, relieve myself, and then refold and stow my clothes, I cursed my decision to eat the papaya. And I had to repeat the process again later that night. I started thinking about how much water was in that fruit\u2014the equivalent of three cups, it turns out. No wonder I had to pee.\n  Our dietary flexibility is perhaps our best defense against dehydration. As I learned the hard way on that sweltering night, the amount of water present in food contributes to total water intake. In the U.S., around 20 percent of the water people ingest comes from food, yet  my work among Tsimane&#39; found that foods, including fruits, contribute up to 50 percent of their total water intake. Adults in Japan, who typically drink less water than adults in the U.S., also get around half their water from the foods they eat. Other populations employ different dietary strategies to meet their water needs. Daasanach pastoralists in northern Kenya consume a great deal of milk, which is 87 percent water. They also chew on water-laden roots.\n  Chimpanzees, our closest living primate relatives, also exhibit dietary and behavioral adaptations to obtaining water. They lick wet rocks and use leaves as sponges to collect water. Primatologist Jill Pruetz of Texas State University has found that in very hot environments, such as the savannas at Fongoli in Senegal, chimps seek shelter in cool caves and forage at night rather than during the day to minimize heat stress and conserve body water. But overall nonhuman primates get most of their water from fruits, leaves and other foods.\n    Humans have evolved to use less water than chimps and other apes, despite our greater sweating ability, as new research by Herman Pontzer of Duke University and his colleagues has shown. Yet our greater reliance on plain water as opposed to water from food means that we must work hard to stay hydrated. Exactly how much water is healthy differs between populations and even from person to person, however. Currently there are two different recommendations for water intake, which includes water from food. The first, from the U.S. National Academy of Medicine, recommends 3.7 liters of water a day for men and 2.7 liters for women, while advising pregnant and lactating women to increase their intake by 300 and 700 milliliters, respectively. The second, from the European Food Safety Authority, recommends 2.5 and 2.0 liters a day for men and women, respectively, with the same increases for pregnant and lactating women. Men need more water than women do because their bodies are larger and have more muscle on average.\n  These are not hard-and-fast recommendations. They were calculated from population averages based on surveys and studies of people in specific regions. They are intended to fulfill the majority of water needs for moderately active, healthy people living in temperate and often climate-controlled environments. Some people may need more or less water depending on factors that include life habits, climate, activity level and age.\n  In fact, water intake varies widely even in relatively water-secure locations such as the U.S. Most men consume between 1.2 and 6.3 liters on a given day and women between 1.0 and 5.1 liters. Throughout human evolution our ancestors&#39; water intake probably also varied substantially based on activity level, temperature, and exposure to wind and solar radiation, along with body size and water availability.\n  Yet it is also the case that two people of similar age and physical condition living in the same environment can consume drastically different amounts of water and both be healthy, at least in the short term. Such variation may relate to early life experiences. Humans undergo a sensitive period during fetal development that influences many physiological functions, among them how our bodies balance water. We receive cues about our nutritional environment while in the womb and during nursing. This information may shape the offspring&#39;s water needs.\n  Experimental studies have demonstrated that water restriction among pregnant rats and sheep leads to critical changes in how their offspring detect bodily dehydration. Offspring born to such water-deprived mothers will be more dehydrated (that is, their urine and blood will be more concentrated) than offspring born to nondeprived mothers before they become thirsty and seek out water. These findings indicate that the dehydration-sensitivity set point is established in the womb.\n  Thus, the hydration cues received during development may determine when people perceive thirst, as well as how much water they drink later in life. In a sense, these early experiences prepare offspring for the amount of water present in their environment. If a pregnant woman is dealing with a water-scarce environment and is chronically dehydrated, it may lead to her child consistently drinking less water later in life\u2014a trait that is adaptive in places where water is hard to come by. Much more work is needed to test this theory, however.\n    Although early life experiences may determine how much water we drink without our being aware of it, locating safe sources of water is something we actively learn to do. In contrast to my accidental discovery of the hydrating effects of the papaya, Tsimane&#39; deliberately seek out water-rich foods. In an environment without clean water, eating instead of drinking more water may protect against exposures to pathogens. Indeed, my study found that those Tsimane&#39; who consumed more of their water from foods and fruit, such as papayas, were less likely to experience diarrhea.\n  Many societies have developed dietary traditions that incorporate low-alcohol, fermented beverages, which can be essential sources of hydration because fermentation kills bacteria. (Beverages containing higher percentages of alcohol, on the other hand, increase urine production and thereby deplete the body&#39;s water stores.) Like other Amazonian populations, Tsimane&#39; drink a fermented beverage called chicha that is made from yuca or cassava. For Tsimane&#39; men, consuming fermented chicha was associated with lower odds of becoming dehydrated.\n  Getting enough water is one of humanity&#39;s oldest and most pressing challenges. Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that we map the locations of water sources in our minds, whether it is a highway rest stop, desert spring or jungle plant. As I watched Julio cut the vine down, his son was also watching, learning where this critical water source was. I glimpsed how this process plays out across generations. In so doing, I realized that being covered in sweat and finding ways to replace that lost water is a big part of what makes us human.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 20:33:55", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e,dependent,\u53ef\u80fd", "title": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u6bd4\u8bb8\u591a\u5176\u4ed6\u54fa\u4e73\u52a8\u7269\u66f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6c34 ", "title_en": "Humans are more dependent on water than many other mammals", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/human-evolution-led-to-an-extreme-thirst-for-water/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e", "dependent", "\u53ef\u80fd"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "979261a90f036cf7b364d21647bad21f.jpeg", "infoid": 1067192, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u91d1\u878d\u65e5\u662f\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6325\u6746\uff0c\u4e00\u5929\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u4e9b\u663e\u7740\u7684\u8033\u673a\u6298\u6263\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\uff0c\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\u548c\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5927\u7968\u5546\u54c1\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6240\u6709\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90fd\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u6700\u597d\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u65e5\u4f18\u60e0\u5217\u8868\u4e2d\u820d\u5165\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u50cf\u6211\u4eec\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u8ba8\u4ef7\u8fd8\u4ef7\u7684\u730e\u4eba\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u4f60\u5c31\u77e5\u9053\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u548c\uff0339;

But if you\u2019re a bargain hunter like us, then you know Amazon&#39;s made-up shopping holiday can also be a good time to snag a few good gadgets on a budget. So to make things easier for those who aren&#39;t looking to spend a ton, we&#39;ve culled Amazon&#39;s mountain of discounts and picked out our favorite deals under\u2014or at least very close to\u2014the $50 mark.\n Note: Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through\u00a0 affiliate programs.\n    You can&#39;t have Prime Day without a slew of discounts on Amazon&#39;s own hardware. We have several higher-priced Amazon devices in our main Prime Day deals guide, but there are still a few Echo speakers, Fire TV Stick streamers, Fire tablets, and Kindle e-readers in the $50 range worth considering.  Of particular note here is the  Fire HD 8, which remains one of the most affordable tablets on the market for everyday web browsing and video viewing, and the  8GB Kindle, our longtime budget pick  among ebook readers. Those are down to $45 and $55, respectively. Meanwhile, the  $25 Fire TV Stick 4K is a speedy outlet to 4K and HDR video, though you&#39;ll have to  put up with Amazon pushing Prime-related content across its user interface. Amazon Fire HD 8\u00a0(32GB, ads) 8-inch tablet for\u00a0 $44.99\u00a0( w/o ads for\u00a0 $60\u2014normally $85).\n   Amazon Kindle\u00a0(8GB, ads) ebook reader for\u00a0 $54.99\u00a0( w/o ads for\u00a0 $75\u2014normally $90).\n    Prime Day&#39;s sales bring a number of discounts on Switch games we like, from borderline essentials like\u00a0  The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\u00a0and\u00a0  Super Mario Odyssey,\u00a0to indie hits like\u00a0  Hollow Knight, to more recent releases like the turn-based RPG\u00a0 Bravely Default II and the  Ars-approved\u00a0 Monster Hunter Rise. For Xbox and PC players, Microsoft&#39;s all-you-can-eat  Xbox Game Pass Ultimate service is  an excellent value at its usual going rate, but three-month memberships are currently available for $30. If you&#39;re completely new to the service, though, note that Microsoft is still selling the  same membership plan for $1.\n     Over on the Sony side, it&#39;s  still next to impossible to actually buy a PlayStation 5, but if you have one, recent PS5 exclusives like\u00a0the  gorgeous\u00a0 Demon&#39;s Souls\u00a0remake and the  punishing roguelite\u00a0 Returnal are down to the lowest prices we&#39;ve tracked. A  couple of PS4 favorites from 2020,\u00a0  Ghost of Tsushima\u00a0and\u00a0  Final Fantasy VII Remake, are down to $30 as well. Both of those come with free upgrades for the current-gen console.  Beyond that,  HyperX&#39;s Cloud Stinger is a  recommended gaming headset for those on a budget, while  Logitech&#39;s G305 Lightspeed is a similarly budget-friendly wireless gaming mouse  we&#39;ve praised in the past. The former is about $10 off its usual street price at $33, while the latter is down to a new low of $28. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\u00a0(Switch, digital) for\u00a0 $41.99\u00a0( Expansion Pass for\u00a0 $13\u2014normally $50).\n  God of War\u00a0(PS4) for\u00a0 $9.99\u00a0(also on PS5 PS Plus Collection\u2014normally $15).\n  Razer Kishi\u00a0mobile game controller for Android for\u00a0 $54.99\u00a0( iOS model for\u00a0 $66\u2014normally $70).\n    Tile&#39;s trackers made their way into our recent\u00a0 Father&#39;s Day gift guide\u00a0despite some new competition from\u00a0Apple&#39;s AirTags. They remain a strong choice for Android devotees or those who are more worried about losing an item on a hike in the woods than in a  city full of iPhones. Prime Day brings some nice discounts to a number of Tile&#39;s most recent trackers, including various bundles that pair multiple form factors together. Among other accessory deals, one highlight is the 256GB version of  Samsung&#39;s Evo Select microSD card. That one is marked down to $26, which is a dollar off the lowest price we&#39;ve seen. This card isn&#39;t the fastest option on the market, but it&#39;s  quick  enough to do most everyday tasks without feeling like a burden, and it&#39;s reliable. If you just need lots of space for cheap, we&#39;ll also note that the  400GB version of SanDisk&#39;s Ultra card is $10 off its usual street price, though its U1-rated performance will be slower for more involved tasks.\n    Samsung Evo Select\u00a0(256GB) microSDXC card\u2014UHS-I, U3, Class 10 for\u00a0 $25.99\u00a0( 512GB model for\u00a0 $62\u2014normally $33).\n SanDisk microSDXC Card for Nintendo Switch (256GB)\u2014UHS-I, U3, V30 for\u00a0 $39.99\u00a0(normally $48).\n    2x Tile Mate\u00a0(2020) + 2x Tile Slim (2020) Bluetooth item trackers for\u00a0 $52.49\u00a0(normally $67).\n Tile Performance Pack: 1x Tile Pro (2020) + 1x Tile Slim (2020) Bluetooth item trackers for\u00a0 $41.99\u00a0(normally $60).\n Tile Slim\u00a0(2-pack, 2020) Bluetooth item tracker for\u00a0 $33.59\u00a0( 1x tracker for\u00a0 $25\u2014normally $47).\n  Tile Pro Essentials Pack: 2x Tile Pro (2020) + 1x Tile Slim (2020) + 1x Tile Sticker Bluetooth item trackers for\u00a0 $59.99\u00a0(normally $100).\n    Anker&#39;s Soundcore Life Q30\u2014 another recent recommendation from our Father&#39;s Day guide\u2014delivers excellent value at its current price of $60. The actual noise cancellation here certainly isn&#39;t the most powerful you can get, but it&#39;s still useful for most situations. With a lively, customizable sound and a comfy construction on top of that, it&#39;s one of the few good pairs of wireless noise-cancelers we&#39;ve found for less than $100, so we&#39;re willing to break our under-$50 limit ever so slightly to shout it out. We&#39;ll do the same with a $60 Prime Day deal on  Fitbit&#39;s Inspire 2, which brings casual\u2014there&#39;s no built-in GPS or altimeter\u2014yet steady activity tracking in a nicely slim design. Grabbing one also nets you a free trial year of Fitbit&#39;s premium guidance and workout plan service.\n  Those wanting to jump on the Instant Pot bandwagon, meanwhile, can get solid value from a half-off deal on the  six-quart Duo Plus, which sits  in the middle of Instant Pot&#39;s lineup in terms of features. Lastly,  Roku&#39;s recently launched Express 4K+\u00a0for $10 off is worth a shout, as it provides a 4K- and AirPlay-compatible streaming stick with voice controls for less than $30.

", "note_en": "Interestingly, those revenue figures have been adjusted to include fair value gains on cryptocurrency assets \u2014 it means that Revolut holds some crypto assets on its balance sheet. Revolut made $54 million (\u00a339 million) in fair value gains on cryptocurrency assets.\n Gross profit reached $170 million (\u00a3123 million) last year. At the same time, the company still reports operating losses. In particular, Q1 2020 was a particularly bad quarter with $76 million (\u00a355 million) in adjusted operating loss.\n  In 2020, total non-adjusted operating loss reached $277 million (\u00a3200.6 million). Like many tech companies, administrative expenses are responsible for this loss. With a staff of 2,200 people, the company spent $367 million (\u00a3266 million) on administrative costs alone. But things seem to be improving as you can see:\n  These trends aren\u2019t that surprising as I reported that fintech startups spent most of 2020  focusing on profitability and improving their margins. At the end 2020, Revolut had 14.5 million personal customers and 500,000 companies using Revolut Business.\n  \u201cAs the extraordinary circumstances of 2020 drove the trend towards digital financial management we continued to innovate for customers to make their financial lives easier and accelerate daily use. We launched 24 new retail and business products, expanded into the US, Japan and Australia and launched banking services in Lithuania, all while significantly improving our profitability,\u201d founder and CEO Nikolay Storonsky said in a statement. \u201cWe began 2021 with a more resilient and productive business that will enhance our trajectory towards rapid growth.\u201d\n When you compare Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, things are radically different for the fintech company. Revenue increased by 130% year-over-year and gross profit grew by 300% between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021.\n Revolut has been launching a ton of products to diversify its sources of revenue. It is increasingly becoming a financial super app with current accounts, debit cards, trading services, insurance products, premium subscriptions, cryptocurrency trading and more.\n Interestingly, interchange revenue from card transactions represents a good chunk of the company\u2019s revenue. In 2020, cards and interchange generated $131 million (\u00a395 million) in revenue. Every time a Revolut customer makes a card purchase, the card scheme (Visa or Mastercard) gives back some fees to Revolut. It\u2019s an incredibly small percentage-based fee, but it can add up when you generate millions of purchases.\n Foreign exchange and wealth generated $111 million (\u00a380 million) in revenue. That\u2019s another big one. And finally, subscriptions, such as Revolut Plus, Revolut Premium and Revolut Metal, accounted for $104 million (\u00a375 million) in revenue.\n Those are three strong pillars that all contribute to the company\u2019s bottom line. They all represent a bit less or a bit more than a third of the company\u2019s overall revenue.\n  While the company has expanded aggressively over the years, the U.K. is still by far its biggest market. In 2020, 88.4% of the company\u2019s (non-adjusted) revenue was related to its activities in the U.K. The European Economic Area without the U.K. represented 10.2% of revenue. The U.S., Japan, Australia and other markets were nearly negligible.\n Revolut has also raised a  mega round of funding in 2020 \u2014\u00a0a $500 million Series D round that was extended to $580 million in total. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the company launches an initial public offering within the next 12 months.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 19:52:36", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name":

out the company\u2019s Series A at $43.5 million, after the company  initially raised $18.5 million in April (some at the time reported this as its Series A, but it seems the round had yet to be completed). The full round includes Zeev Ventures, Vertex Ventures Israel, and Innovation Endeavors, with  Vintage Investment Partners added in this most recent tranche. DataRails is not disclosing its valuation, except to note that it has doubled in the last four months, with hundreds of customers and on target to cross 1,000 this year, with a focus on the North American market. It has raised $55 million in total.\n The challenge that DataRails has identified is that on one hand, SMBs have started to adopt a lot more apps, including software delivered as a service, to help them manage their businesses \u2014 a trend that has been accelerated in the last year with the pandemic and the knock-on effect that has had for remote working and bringing more virtual elements to replace face-to-face interactions. Those apps can include Salesforce, NetSuite, Sage, SAP, QuickBooks, Zuora, Xero, ADP and more.\n  But on the other hand, those in the business who manage its finances and financial reporting are lacking the tools to look at the data from these different apps in a holistic way. While Excel is a default application for many of them, they are simply reading lots of individual spreadsheets rather than integrated data analytics based on the numbers.\n DataRails has built a platform that can read the reported information, which typically already lives in Excel spreadsheets, and automatically translate it into a bigger picture view of the company.\n For SMEs, Excel is such a central piece of software, yet such a pain point for its lack of extensibility and function, that this predicament was actually the germination of starting DataRails in the first place,\n Didi Gurfinkel, the CEO who co-founded the company with Eyal Cohen (the CPO) said that DataRails\u2019 initially set out to create a more general purpose product that could help analyze and visualize anything from Excel.\n  \u201cWe started the company with a vision to save the world from Excel spreadsheets,\u201d he said, by taking them and helping to connect the data contained within them to a structured database. \u201cThe core of our technology knows how to take unstructured data and map that to a central database.\u201d Before 2020, DataRails (which was founded in 2015) applied this to a variety of areas with a focus on banks, insurance companies, compliance and data integrity.\n Over time, it could see a very specific application emerging, specifically for SMEs: providing a platform for FP&amp;A (financial planning and analytics), which didn\u2019t really have a solution to address it at the time. \u201cSo we enabled that to beat the market.\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re already investing so much time and money in their software, but they still don\u2019t have analytics and insight,\u201d said Gurfinkel.\n That turned out to be fortunate timing, since \u201cdigital transformation\u201d and getting more out of one\u2019s data was really starting to get traction in the world of business,  specifically in the world of SMEs, and CFOs and other people who oversaw finances were already looking for something like this.\n The typical DataRails customer might be as small as a business of 50 people, or as big as 1,000 employees, a size of business that is too small for enterprise solutions, \u201cwhich can cost tens of thousands of dollars to implement and use,\u201d added Cohen, among other challenges. But as with so many of the apps that are being built today to address those using Excel, the idea with DataRails is low-code or even more specifically no-code, which means \u201cno IT in the loop,\u201d he said.\n \u201cThat\u2019s why we are so successful,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are crossing the barrier and making our solution easy to use.\u201d\n The company doesn\u2019t have a huge number of competitors today, either, although companies like  Cube (which also  recently raised some money) are among them. And others like Stripe, while currently not focussing on FP&amp;A, have most definitely been expanding the tools that it is providing to businesses as part of their bigger play to manage payments and subsequently other processes related to financial activity, so perhaps it, or others like it, might at some point become competitors in this space as well.\n In the meantime, Gurfinkel said that other areas that DataRails is likely to expand to cover alongside FP&amp;A are likely to include HR, inventory, and \u201cplanning for anything,\u201d any process that you have running in Excel. Another interesting turn would be how and if DataRails decides to look beyond Excel at other spreadsheets, or bypass spreadsheets altogether.\n The scope of the opportunity \u2014 in the U.S. alone there are more than 30 million small businesses \u2014 is what\u2019s attracting the investment here.\n \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to reinvest in DataRails and continue working with the team to help them navigate their recent explosive and rapid growth,\u201d said Yanai Oron, General Partner at  Vertex Ventures, in a statement. \u201cWith innovative yet accessible technology and a tremendous untapped market opportunity, DataRails is primed to scale and become the leading FP&amp;A solution for SMEs everywhere.\u201d\n \u201cBusinesses are constantly about to start, in the midst of, or have just finished a round of financial reporting\u2014it\u2019s a never-ending cycle,\u201d added Oren Zeev, founding partner at Zeev Ventures. \u201cBut with DataRails, FP&amp;A can be simple, streamlined, and effective, and that\u2019s a vision we\u2019ll back again and again.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-21 19:52:18", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "datarails,financial", "title": "DataRails Books $ 25m\u4ee5\u4e0a\u4e3aSMBS\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8d22\u52a1\u62a5\u544a\u5de5\u5177 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tDataRails books $25M more to build better financial reporting tools for SMBs\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/datarails-books-25m-more-to-build-better-financial-reporting-tools-for-smbs/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["datarails", "financial"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "2f767704e76e7b1a004f41d1a06bcc46.jpg", "infoid": 1067189, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7845\u8c37\u79d1\u6280\u5de8\u5934\u5468\u4e00\u5ba3\u5e03\uff0c\u5b83\u5df2\u7ecf\u51b3\u5b9a\uff06\uff0334;\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u6253\u5f00\uff06\uff0334;\u5728\u4e1c\u4f26\u6566\u7684\u6821\u56ed\u88ab\u8feb\u5173\u95ed\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u3002\n  \uff06\uff0334;\u6211\u4eec\uff06\uff0339;\u91cd\u65b0\u5173\u95ed\u6821\u56ed\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6574\u4e2aU.K\u7684\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u3002\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u58f0\u79f0\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u7269\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e3a\u5168\u56fd\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002\n \u6821\u56ed\u4f26\u6566\uff0c\u5168\u7403\u51e0\u4e2a\u6821\u56ed\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4e8e2012\u5e74\u7531\u4ee5\u8272\u5217\u6280\u672f\u8001\u5c06\u548c\u8c37\u6b4c\u5458\u5de5Eze Vidra\u5f00\u5e55\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4f26\u6566\uff06\uff0339;\u542f\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u5f00\u59cb\u8d77\u98de\u3002\n Vidra\u5468\u4e00\u544a\u8bc9CNBC\uff0c\u6821\u56ed\u7684\u7ed3\u675f\u662f\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u82e6\u4e50\u53c2\u534a\u3002 \uff06\uff0334;\u751c\u871c\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u662f\u5b83\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u82e6\u6da9\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u662f\u5b83\u7684\uff06\uff0339;\u5b83\u7684\u4e00\u7aef\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u4ed6\u8bf4\u3002\n \uff06\uff0334;\u6211\u4e2a\u4eba\u5f88\u9ad8\u5174\u770b\u5230U.K.\u542f\u52a8\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5df2\u7ecf\u6210\u957f\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;

Campus in East London after it was forced to close by the coronavirus pandemic.\n  &#34;We&#39;re closing Campus to support start-ups throughout the U.K.,&#34; the company said, claiming that it can provide support for start-ups across the country without a physical space.\n Campus London, one of several Campus sites worldwide, was opened in 2012 by Israeli tech veteran and Google employee Eze Vidra as London&#39;s start-up scene began to take off.\n Vidra told CNBC on Monday that the closing of Campus is emotional and bittersweet. &#34;The sweet part is that it succeeded and the bitter part is that it&#39;s an end of an era,&#34; he said.\n &#34;I&#39;m personally very happy to see how the U.K. start-up ecosystem has grown,&#34; said Vidra, adding that it feels a bit like Campus is &#34;no longer needed as much&#34; now that London&#39;s start-up scene is established.\n  Located in the gentrified Shoreditch neighborhood \u2014 a few hundred meters from the Old Street gyratory system that became known as &#34;Silicon Roundabout&#34; \u2014 Campus was often thought of as being at the epicenter of London&#39;s Tech City, which some tech workers say  may never be the same again.\n  Campus contained co-working space, a cafe, and an event space. It was used by a variety of accelerators and start-up programs including Seedcamp, Entrepreneur First, Code First, and Silicon Drinkabout. There were thousands of events put on there over the years and Googlers used to come in and offer free mentoring to start-ups.\n Campus operated at a loss since its inception, Vidra said, adding that it was never meant to be revenue generating. &#34;It was quite a high investment,&#34; said Vidra, who is now a managing partner at Remagine Ventures.\n Google said the U.K. start-up community &#34;doesn&#39;t need access to a single shared physical space as much as it needs access to resources, mentors and programs available at scale, anywhere.&#34;\n &#34;When I first set foot in Campus London in 2012, it felt like magic,&#34; said Marta Krupinska, head of Google for Start-ups U.K., on Twitter. &#34;It&#39;s played a pivotal role in making London such a successful start-up ecosystem and after almost 10 years, a new chapter opens. So much to celebrate, and still so much work to do.&#34;\n  Sarah Drinkwater, who ran Campus from 2014 to 2018, said in  a blog on Monday: &#34;It&#39;s right that Campus won&#39;t re-open after the Covid closure. Scenes change, and you have to play it as it lays.&#34;\n Drinkwater, who worked on Google Maps before she joined Campus, said there are hundreds of coworking spaces in London and dozens and dozens of accelerators across the U.K. today.\n &#34;This one scrappy space on Bonhill Street provided the container for many different sub-communities to start or come together, and a way in for incredibly different profiles who wanted to find out what this &#39;tech&#39; thing was,&#34; wrote Drinkwater.\n &#34;Repeatedly, I&#39;d meet an uncertain early founder in the cafe trying to figure it out then bump into them, a year later, with a team and funding and a clear way forwards,&#34; said Drinkwater. &#34;Sometimes, those companies flew; sometimes they didn&#39;t and a great hire was back on the market.&#34;\n Tech entrepreneurs, developers and investors reminisced about their times at Campus on social media and in blog posts.\n &#34;So many great memories and good friends met there,&#34; wrote Amandine Flachs, the CEO and co-founder of Wild Meta AI, which aims to help video game developers create smarter and more human-like AIs with machine learning.\n Hannah Blake, CEO and co-founder of podcast app Entale, told CNBC it&#39;s a &#34;big loss&#34; and that it was &#34;the heart and soul of the London start-up scene.&#34;\n Andrew Eland, who worked at Google for over 11 years, leading teams in Silicon Valley working on Google Maps among other projects, said Campus broadened the people in the London technology scene, and the type of problems they worked on.\n &#34;I think the idea with all the Campus sites was to help incubate early tech communities, and London is obviously well beyond that stage now,&#34; Eland told CNBC.\n  With thousands of start-ups, London is now one of the main tech hubs in Europe, but the city is yet to spawn a tech behemoth on anything like Google&#39;s scale.\n &#34;While we still haven&#39;t produced a Google or a Facebook, we did 100 unicorns (businesses valued at $1 billion or more),&#34; said Vidra. &#34;Many of them had their first public pitch or appearance on the Campus stage including TransferWise and Revolut.&#34;\n Google operates other campuses in Madrid, Sao Paulo, Seoul, Tel Aviv, Tokyo and Warsaw. Google did not immediately respond when CNBC asked if it plans to close any of the other campuses.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 19:45:26", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "google,\u8c37\u6b4c,\u6821\u56ed,forced", "title": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u8feb\u4f7f\u5b83\u5173\u95ed\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u5b83\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u6253\u5f00\u6821\u56ed\u7684\u4f26\u6566\u7684\u542f\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4 ", "title_en": "Google says it has decided not to reopen Campus, its London-based startup space, after the pandemic forced it to close", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/21/google-campus-london-closes-to-start-ups-post-covid.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["google", "\u8c37\u6b4c", "\u6821\u56ed", "forced"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "36e8c23f1e5c0b5cfab1c198ca3d2cae.jpg", "infoid": 1067188, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5fb7\u56fd\uff06\uff0339;\u8054\u90a6\u5361\u7279\u5c14\u529e\u4e8b\u5904\uff0cBundeskartellamt\uff0c\u4eca\u5929\u542f\u52a8\u4e86\u5bf9Apple\u5173\u4e8e\u4e0eApp Store\uff0c\u5176\u4ea7\u54c1\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u670d\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53cd\u7ade\u4e89\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7d22\u8d54\u7684\u8bc9\u8bbc\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u3002\n \u4eca\u5929\u5ba3\u5e03\u7684\u82f9\u679c\u5ba3\u5e03\u5c06\u786e\u5b9aCupertino Tech Giant\u662f\u5426\u6301\u6709A\uff06\uff0334;\u8de8\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff06\uff0334;\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u82f9\u679c\u5747\u62e5\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u529b\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\uff06\uff0334;\u5176\u4ed6\u516c\u53f8\uff06\uff0334;\u6311\u6218\u5b83\u3002\n  \u6211\u4eec\u73b0\u5728\u5c06\u5ba1\u67e5\u5176\u4e13\u6709\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edfIOS\uff0cApple\u5728\u5176iPhone\u5468\u56f4\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u5b57\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u904d\u5e03\u591a\u4e2a\u5e02\u573a\u3002 Apple\u751f\u4ea7\u5e73\u677f\u7535\u8111\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u548c\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e0e\u8bbe\u5907\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u5236\u9020\u5404\u79cd\u786c\u4ef6\u4ea7\u54c1\u5916\uff0c\u6280\u672f\u516c\u53f8\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9bApp Store\uff0cIcloud\uff0cAppleCare\uff0cApple Music\uff0cApple Arcade\uff0cApple TV +\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5176\u670d\u52a1\u4e1a\u52a1\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7acb\u573a\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u9762\u5ba1\u89c6\u5176\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u5e02\u573a\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u5176\u6280\u672f\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u91cd\u70b9\u662f\u5e94\u7528\u5546\u5e97\u7684\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4f7fApple\u80fd\u591f\u5f71\u54cd\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u7684\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\n \u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u5bf9\u5176\u8c03\u67e5\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u7f3a\u70b9;\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8be5\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5b83\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e00\u5bb6\u8de8\u5e02\u573a\u91cd\u89c6\u7684\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u7981\u6b62\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u6765\u81ea\uff06\uff0334;\u4ece\u4e8b\u53cd\u7ade\u4e89\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\n \u8be5\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u8868\u793a\u5df2\u6536\u5230\uff06\uff0334;\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u53cd\u7ade\u4e89\u5b9e\u8df5\u6709\u5173\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u6295\u8bc9\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e0e\u6700\u8fd1\u7684ATT\u63a8\u51fa\u6216\u5e94\u7528\u8ddf\u8e2a\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u5173\u3002 4\u6708\u4efd\uff0c\u4e5d\u4e2a\u884c\u4e1a\u534f\u4f1a\u4ee3\u8868Facebook\u548c\u51fa\u7248\u5546Axel Springer\u7b49\u516c\u53f8\u5411\u8054\u90a6\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u63d0\u8d77\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u6295\u8bc9\uff0c\u58f0\u79f0Apper\uff06\uff0339;

", "note_en": "Germany&#39;s Federal Cartel Office, the Bundeskartellamt, today initiated proceedings against Apple on the claims of anti-competitive behavior related to the  App Store, its products, and other services, according to a  press release.\n The proceeding against Apple announced today will determine whether the Cupertino tech giant holds a &#34;paramount significance across markets&#34; and whether, through its ecosystem, Apple holds enough power to make it difficult for &#34;other companies&#34; to challenge it.\n  We will now examine whether with its proprietary operating system iOS, Apple has created a digital ecosystem around its  iPhone that extends across several markets. Apple produces tablets, computers and wearables and provides a host of device-related services. In addition to manufacturing various hardware products, the tech company also offers the \u200cApp Store\u200c,  iCloud,  AppleCare,  Apple Music,  Apple Arcade,  Apple TV+ as well as other services as part of its services business. Besides assessing the company\u2019s position in these areas, we will, among other aspects, examine its extensive integration across several market levels, the magnitude of its technological and financial resources and its access to data. A main focus of the investigations will be on the operation of the \u200cApp Store\u200c as it enables Apple in many ways to influence the business activities of third parties.\n The press release is short on specifics on what the outcome of its investigation may lead to; however, the office says that if it determines a company to be of importance across markets, it may prohibit that company from &#34;engaging in anti-competitive practices.&#34;\n The office says it has received &#34;various complaints relating to potentially anti-competitive practices,&#34; particularly related to the recent rollout of ATT or the App Tracking Transparency framework. In April, nine industry associations representing companies like Facebook and publisher Axel Springer  filed an antitrust complaint to the federal office, claiming that Apple&#39;s ATT framework will severely hurt publishers and their bottom lines, deeming it a threat to their business.\n According to the press release, another complaint that the office received related to the pre-installation of Apple&#39;s own apps on its devices. The office directly references section 19a of the German Competition Act, which states &#34;the abuse of a dominant position by one or several undertakings is prohibited&#34; as a potential clause that Apple may be violating.\n Russia recently took the first major step against Apple for the pre-installation of its own apps, requiring the company to  show users a screen to download government-approved apps during initial device setup. Similar legislation being proposed in the U.S. Congress  would require Apple to give users the ability to delete all pre-installed Apple apps, instead of a select handful that users may currently delete.\n The Bundeskartellamt also lists ongoing disputes regarding Apple&#39;s in-app purchasing system, which gives the tech giant a 30% commission of all purchases made and the restriction that apps may only be distributed on Apple devices through the company&#39;s \u200cApp Store\u200c and not other third-party app marketplaces.\n Ummm, that\u2019s the main reason I buy Apple devices. It\u2019s all integrated, I can see all my stuff across multiple devices etc. I buy into Apple because it IS ring fenced and controlled!\n Why is this not a problem with cars? How come I can&#39;t install and sideload any apps inside my car system? Tesla doesn&#39;t allow me to install some kind of carplay app or even have perhaps a music streaming service of my choice.. Honestly, I&#39;m not sure this is all in the best interest of consumers.. Yes, the competition is good.. But if the cars get taken over by virus&#39;s and starting killing people, is that ok also? I continue to think the walled garden is a good choice.. Even if it limits dev&#39;s in some ways.. You know when they used to sell retail software in stores, the stores/wholesale pipeline took over 75% of the profits.. And was that not a problem before??\n Russia, Germany, who\u2019s next? ?  Don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t use it, android is that way ?\u200d\u2642\ufe0f?\n  Yup.  I think that&#39;s the most reasonable compromise. Add a setup screen where you get to pick default apps. Randomize those apps, and either have them curated (that comes with the problem: who does the curation?) or perhaps auto-generated based on App Store popularity.  Something like this, but for more types of apps:\nIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it ? if people want spyware and malware, android is over there ?\n  After a long wait, YouTube for iOS is officially gaining picture-in-picture support, allowing all users, non-premium and premium subscribers, to close the YouTube app and continue watching their video in a small pop-up window.\rIn a statement to MacRumors, YouTube says that picture-in-picture is currently rolling out to all premium subscribers on iOS and that a larger rollout to all US iOS...\n The Apple news cycle started to move beyond WWDC this week, but that doesn&#39;t mean there still wasn&#39;t a lot to talk about, led by the official debut of the much-leaked Beats Studio Buds that might give us a hint of what to expect for the second-generation AirPods Pro.\rWith no hardware announcements at WWDC, we also took a look at when we might finally see the long-rumored redesigned MacBook...\n A wireless network naming bug has been discovered in iOS that effectively disables an iPhone&#39;s ability to connect to Wi-Fi.\rSecurity researcher Carl Schou found that after joining a Wi-Fi network with the name &#34;%p%s%s%s%s%n&#34; his iPhone&#39;s Wi-Fi functionality was left &#34;permanently disabled.&#34; Changing a hotspot&#39;s SSID did nothing to correct the problem, with even a reboot failing to make a...\n With iOS 15 and macOS Monterey, Apple is adding several quality of life improvements, which are designed to address some of the complaints that people have had with these operating systems for years now.\rSubscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.

", "note_en": "Exclusive: Watch footage showing the &#39;destruction zone&#39; in Amazon&#39;s Dunfermline warehouse where millions of unsold items are destroyed every year\n  Online giant   Amazon is destroying millions of items of unsold stock every year, products that are often new and unused, ITV News can reveal.\n Footage gathered by ITV News shows waste on an astonishing level.   And this is from just one of 24 fulfilment centres they currently operate in the UK.  Undercover filming from inside Amazon&#39;s Dunfermline warehouse reveals the sheer scale of the waste: Smart TVs, laptops, drones, hairdryers, top of the range headphones, computer drives, books galore, thousands of sealed face masks \u2013 all sorted into boxes marked \u201cdestroy\u201d.\n  Products that were never sold, or returned by a customer. Almost all could have been redistributed to charities or those in need. Instead, they are thrown into vast bins, carried away by lorries (which we tracked), and dumped at either recycling centres or, worse, a landfill site.\n  An ex-employee, who asked for anonymity, told us: &#34;From a Friday to a Friday our target was to generally destroy 130,000 items a week.   &#34;I used to gasp. There&#39;s no rhyme or reason to what gets destroyed: Dyson fans, Hoovers, the occasional MacBook and iPad; the other day, 20,000 Covid (face) masks still in their wrappers.\n  &#34;Overall, 50 percent of all items are unopened and still in their shrink wrap. The other half are returns and in good condition. Staff have just become numb to what they are being asked to do.\u201d\n In one week in April, a leaked document from inside the Dunfermline warehouse showed more than 124,000 items marked &#39;destroy&#39;. To repeat, that&#39;s just for seven days. In contrast, just 28,000 items in the same period were labelled &#39;donate&#39;.   The same manager admitted to us that in some weeks, as many as 200,000 items could be marked &#39;destroy&#39;.\n  Why are hundreds of thousands of products being destroyed in this way? The answer is Amazon\u2019s hugely successful business model. Many vendors choose to house their products in Amazon\u2019s vast warehouses.   But the longer the goods remain unsold, the more a company is charged to store them. It is eventually cheaper to dispose of the goods, especially stock from overseas, than to continue storing the stock.\n Greenpeace&#39;s Sam Chetan Welsh told us: \u201cIt&#39;s an unimaginable amount of unnecessary waste, and just shocking to see a multi-billion pound company getting rid of stock in this way.\n  &#34;Stuff that\u2019s not even single use but not being used at all, straight off the production line and into the bin. As long as Amazon\u2019s business model relies on this kind of disposal culture, things are only going to get worse. The government must step in and bring in legislation immediately.\u201d  In an interview before he knew about our investigation, Amazon\u2019s UK boss John Boumphrey told ITV News the amount the company destroys is \u201cextremely small.\u201d\n What Amazon is doing is not illegal. In a response to the findings of our investigation, the company said: \u201cWe are working towards a goal of zero product disposal and our priority is to resell, donate to charitable organisations or recycle any unsold products. No items are sent to landfill in the UK. As a last resort, we will send items to energy recovery, but we&#39;re working hard to drive the number of times this happens down to zero.\u201d\n  Go forty miles southwest from Dunfermline and you\u2019ll arrive in Glasgow, where the UK will host the world\u2019s biggest ever climate conference in November. And yet, just up the road, Amazon is producing huge amounts of environmental waste.\n Leaders could do worse than begin by telling the world\u2019s biggest online retailer to set an example.\n   Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told ITV News he was &#34;very surprised&#34; about the findings of our investigation and said he wanted &#34;to get to the bottom of what is actually happening&#34;.\n &#34;I know that Amazon is committed to net zero, they\u2019ve committed huge amounts of investment to the rainforest, to keeping the rainforest going and I\u2019m surprised,&#34; Mr Kwarteng said.\n &#34;I haven\u2019t read the report so I need to look at the report to see what my response is. But I think Amazon should do the right thing and it would be very disappointing if this is true.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-21 19:39:41", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a,\u80a1\u7968,amazon,\u552e\u51fa,destroying", "title": "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u6bcf\u5e74\u5728\u5176\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e2d\u6467\u6bc1\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u4e2a\u672a\u552e\u51fa\u7684\u80a1\u7968 ", "title_en": "Amazon destroying millions of items of unsold stock in its warehouses every year", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.itv.com/news/2021-06-21/amazon-destroying-millions-of-items-of-unsold-stock-in-one-of-its-uk-warehouses-every-year-itv-news-investigation-finds", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a", "\u80a1\u7968", "amazon", "\u552e\u51fa"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7fd6822deba2be1e049e03d463a24614.jpeg", "infoid": 1067184, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4e0a\u5468\u6211\u53c2\u52a0\u4e86.debug\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u4f1a\u8bae\uff0c\u6211\u516c\u53f8\u4e3e\u529e\u5c55\u4f4d\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u60f3\u6cd5\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u201c\u6539\u53d8\u6211\u7684\u601d\u60f3\u201d\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\u6211\u4eec\u4ee3\u8868\u7740\u4e00\u4e2a\u6fc0\u8fdb\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\uff0c\u9080\u8bf7\u4eba\u4eec\u4e0e\u6211\u4eec\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u544a\u8bc9\u4ed6\u4eec\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e9b\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u3002\n   \u9664\u4e86\u7b11\u8bdd\uff0c\u53cd\u5e94\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cbe\u7f8e\u7684\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u3002\u5b83\u5728Web\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u58f0\u660e\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u529f\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5f53\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002\u6e32\u67d3\u5f15\u64ce\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7136\u540e\uff086\u62167\u5e74\u524d\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u53cd\u5e94\u5b83\u5f88\u597d\u3002\n \u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fa7\u9762\uff0cember\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u540c\u6837\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5b83\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u8868\u6f14\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6846\u67b6\u592a\u4e3a\u81ea\u4ee5\u4e3a\u662f\u8d76\u4e0a\u53cd\u5e94\u6240\u505a\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\n  \u5728\u53cd\u5e94\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u4e4b\u540e\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e71\u4e03\u516b\u7cdf\u3002\u5b83\u5728\u793e\u533a\u4e2d\u5f00\u59cb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u4e00\u5207\u90fd\u56f4\u7ed5\u7740\u7092\u4f5c\uff0c\u65b0\u5947\uff0c\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002\u6bcf\u9694\u51e0\u4e2a\u6708\u90fd\u6709\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\uff0c\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u7f16\u5199React Web Apps\u7684\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u591a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898 -

The idea was to have a \u201cchange my mind\u201d kind of setup, where we represent a radical idea, invite people to debate with us, and show them that we\u2019re building some interesting stuff at   Productive .\n   Jokes aside, React is a fine library. It\u2019s important in web development because it introduced declarative and reactive templates, a paradigm shift that everyone needed at the time. There was a problem with rendering engines and reactivity back then (6 or 7 years ago) and React solved it pretty well.\n As a side note, Ember solved the same problem earlier. It wasn\u2019t as performant, though, and the framework was too opinionated to catch up with the way React had done it.\n  What happened after React gained popularity was a mess. It started a new trend in the community where everything revolves around hype, novelty, and creating new paradigm shifts. Every few months there were new libraries emerging, setting new standards of how we should write React web apps, yet solving problems that were, for the most part \u2014 already solved.\n Let\u2019s take \u201cstate management\u201d as an example. Since React is missing a traditional dependency injection system (DI is achieved through component composition), the community had to solve this problem on its own. And it did. Over and over and again. Each new year brought a new set of standards.\n  React is just a rendering engine, and in a typical web app, you need many libraries to build a framework for a project \u2014 e.g. data layers, state management, routing, asset bundlers, and more.\n The ecosystem behind React gave you too many choices of this sort, which fragmented the tech stack and caused the infamous \u201cJavascript fatigue\u201d.\n One of the trends that also emerged was \u201cframework comparison obsession\u201d. JS frameworks were constantly compared with properties like rendering speed and memory footprint. This is irrelevant most of the time because a slow app is not caused by a slow JS framework, it\u2019s caused by bad code.\n  As with every trend that is taking over the world \u2014 this one went too far, damaging new generations of web developers. I\u2019m wondering how it\u2019s possible for a library to be the most relevant skill on an average web developer\u2019s CV? Even worse, it\u2019s not even a library but a module inside that library. React hooks are more often mentioned as a \u201cskill\u201d as opposed to some actual skills like code refactoring or code review.\n    \u2026 not by mentioning the most starred library on Github, but by showing me one or two of your finest snippets.\n  \u2026 not by mentioning a popular state management library (preferably ending with \u201cX\u201d), but by telling me why \u201cdata should go down and actions should go up\u201d. Or why state should be modified where it was created and not deeper in the component hierarchy.\n  \u2026 not by telling me that you know Jest or QUnit, but by explaining why it\u2019s hard to automate end-to-end tests and why minimal meaningful rendering tests are 10% the effort and 90% the benefit.\n  \u2026 not by mentioning that you use CI/CD (as every other project today that has more than one person working on it), but by explaining that deployment and release should be separate so you should code new stuff in a way that doesn\u2019t mess with the old stuff and can be turned on remotely.\n  \u2026 not by mentioning that you\u2019re a \u201cteam player\u201d, but by telling me that code review is just as hard on the reviewer\u2019s side and that you know how to optimize your PRs for readability and clarity.\n  \u2026 because unless you\u2019re a one-man band, you\u2019ll hate your life if you don\u2019t follow strict standards and conventions in a project. You should tell me that naming is hard and the broader the scope of the variable, the more time you should invest in coming up with a good name for it.\n  \u2026 because code review ensures product quality, reduces bugs and technical debt, builds common team knowledge, and more \u2014 but only if done thoroughly. Code review shouldn\u2019t only be done top-down. It\u2019s a great learning mechanism for less experienced team members.\n  \u2026 because it\u2019s not about the GitHub stars, it\u2019s about common principles that most of today\u2019s JS frameworks share. Finding out about the pros and cons of other frameworks makes you understand your framework of choice better.\n  \u2026 because technology is only a tool for making products, not the process. Spending time on optimizing the process is always better than spending time on arguing about technology.\n    \u2026 because pair-programming is, like code review, the most important practice for knowledge sharing and building team cohesion. It\u2019s also fun!\n  \u2026 because every project has technical debt and you should stop whining about it and start refactoring. Every new feature should be preceded by a minor code refactoring. Big refactoring or rewrites never turn out well.\n  So yeah, that\u2019s why I think React ruined web development. People at the conference were intrigued by the claim and joined the debate eagerly. I had a great conversation with few experienced React developers. Nobody agrees with the title of this article, saying \u201cruined\u201d is too strong of a word. But most of them agree with the problems discussed in this article.\n You can try to convince me that React isn\u2019t that bad, and I will absolutely agree with you! \ud83d\ude04\n But instead, let\u2019s debate about the more important topics \u2014  the work that we actually do as software engineers.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 19:39:20", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5f00\u53d1,ruined,\u5e94\u8be5", "title": "React Ruined Web\u5f00\u53d1 ", "title_en": "React Ruined Web Development", "transed": 1, "url": "https://medium.com/building-productive/react-ruined-web-development-dd65342a833f", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5f00\u53d1", "ruined", "\u5e94\u8be5"]}]
