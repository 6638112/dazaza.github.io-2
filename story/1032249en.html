In a bizarre, ironic, and disturbing commentary on trends in modern media, the celebrated reporter was forced to resign after writing a story criticizing both the Biden campaign and intelligence community — only to have it spiked by the editors of  The Intercept, the news outlet he co-founded six years ago with the aim of preventing pretty much this exact situation.</p><p>普利策奖获得者格伦·格林沃尔德今天早上辞职。在一篇关于现代媒体趋势的离奇、讽刺和令人不安的评论中，这位著名的记者在写了一篇批评拜登竞选团队和情报界的报道后被迫辞职-结果却被他在六年前与人共同创立的新闻机构The Intercept的编辑猛烈抨击，目的是防止几乎发生这种情况。</p><p> “The irony,” Greenwald says, “is that a media outlet I co-founded, and which was built on my name and my accomplishments, with the purpose of guaranteeing editorial independence, is now censoring me in the most egregious way — about the leading presidential candidate, a week before the election.”</p><p>“具有讽刺意味的是，”格林沃尔德说，“我与人共同创立的一家媒体机构，以我的名字和成就为基础，目的是保证编辑独立，现在却以最恶劣的方式对我进行审查--在选举前一周，对领先的总统候选人进行审查。”</p><p> Greenwald becomes the latest high-profile journalist to leave a well-known legacy media organization to join Substack. You’ll be able to read the piece rebuffed by  The Intercept  at his new site here.</p><p>格林沃尔德成为最新一位离开知名传统媒体机构加盟Substack的知名记者。你可以在他的新网站上阅读这篇被“拦截”回绝的文章。</p><p>  Greenwald, after commenting pointedly about the reaction by press and Democratic Party officials to the  New York Post story, reached out to  Intercept editor Betsy Reed to float the idea of writing on the subject.</p><p>格林沃尔德在尖锐地评论了媒体和民主党官员对“纽约邮报”报道的反应后，联系了截取编辑贝齐·里德(Betsy Reed)，提出了就这个主题写作的想法。</p><p> The first hint of trouble came when Reed suggested that yes, it might be a story, if proven correct, but “even if it did represent something untoward about Biden,” that would “represent a tiny fraction of the sleaze and lies Trump and his cronies are oozing in every day.”</p><p>麻烦的第一个迹象是，里德表示，是的，这可能是一个故事，如果被证明是正确的，但“即使它确实代表了拜登的一些不愉快之处”，那也“代表了特朗普和他的亲信每天都在渗入的肮脏和谎言的一小部分”。</p><p> When Greenwald retorted that deciding not to report on one politician’s scandals because those of another politician are deemed worse is a “corrupt calculus” for reporters, Reed expressed concern. Based on this, on his comments on Twitter, and other factors, she worried that “we are headed for a conflict over the editing of this piece.”</p><p>格林沃尔德反驳说，决定不报道一位政客的丑闻，因为另一位政客的丑闻被认为更糟糕，这对记者来说是一种“腐败的考量”，里德表达了担忧。基于此，基于他在推特上的评论，以及其他因素，她担心“我们在编辑这篇文章的过程中会发生冲突。”</p><p> Greenwald insisted he wasn’t planning an overwhelming amount of coverage but wanted to do a single article, reviewing the available facts and perhaps asking the Biden campaign to comment on the veracity of the  Post story. Reed agreed that he should write a draft, then they could “see where we are.”</p><p>格林沃尔德坚称，他并没有计划进行铺天盖地的报道，但他想做一篇文章，审查现有的事实，或许还会要求拜登竞选团队对“华盛顿邮报”的报道的真实性发表评论。里德同意他应该写一份草稿，这样他们就可以“看到我们在哪里”。</p><p> An aside: when reporters and editors interact, they speak between the lines. If an editor only ever suggests or assigns stories from a certain angle, you’re being told they don’t particularly want the other angle. If your editor has lots of hypothetical concerns at the start, he or she probably won’t be upset if you choose a different topic. Finally, when an editor lays out “suggestions” about things that might “help” a piece “be even stronger,” it’s a signal both parties understand about what elements have to be put in before the editor will send the thing through.</p><p>旁白：当记者和编辑互动时，他们会言外之意。如果编辑只从某个角度建议或分配故事，你就被告知他们不是特别想要另一个角度。如果你的编辑在一开始就有很多假设性的担忧，如果你选择一个不同的主题，他或她可能不会感到不安。最后，当编辑对可能“帮助”一篇文章“做得更好”的事情提出“建议”时，这是一个信号，表明双方都明白在编辑将文章发送出去之前必须加入哪些元素。</p><p> Reed explained that any piece Greenwald wrote on the Biden/Burisma subject would have to go through “the editorial process and fact-checking that we do with any story with this kind of high profile.” Peter Maass would edit, but Reed also noted that there was a lot of “in-house knowledge” they could all “tap into.”</p><p>里德解释说，格林沃尔德写的任何关于拜登/缅甸主题的文章都必须经过“编辑过程和事实核查，就像我们对任何这种高调的报道所做的那样”。彼得·马斯将进行编辑，但里德也指出，他们都可以“利用”大量的“内部知识”。</p><p> By “in-house knowledge,” she meant the work of Robert Mackey and Jim Risen, two  Intercept reporters with whom Greenwald clashed in the past. Risen had already loudly denounced the  Post story not only as conspiracy theory, but foreign disinformation. Essentially, Reed was telling Greenwald his piece would be quasi-edited by people with whom he’d had major public disagreements about Russia-related issues going back years.</p><p>她所说的“内部知识”指的是罗伯特·麦基(Robert Mackey)和吉姆·瑞斯(Jim Rise)的工作，这两名窃听记者过去曾与格林沃尔德发生过冲突。Rise已经大声谴责“华盛顿邮报”的故事不仅是阴谋论，而且是外国的虚假信息。基本上，里德告诉格林沃尔德，他的文章将由几年前与他在俄罗斯相关问题上存在重大公开分歧的人进行准编辑。</p><p> To this, Greenwald responded that this was a double-standard: when Risen wrote  an article credulously quoting intelligence officials like James Clapper, John Brennan, and Michael Hayden (more on the extreme irony of this later) describing the  Post story as having “the classic earmarks of Russian misinformation,” he could do so willy-nilly. But when Greenwald wanted to write an op-ed piece questioning the “prevailing wisdom on Biden and Burisma,” a team of people would would be summoned.</p><p>对于这一点，格林沃尔德回应说，这是一种双重标准：当Rise写了一篇文章，轻信地引用了詹姆斯·克拉珀(James Clapper)、约翰·布伦南(John Brennan)和迈克尔·海登(Michael Hayden)等情报官员的话(稍后将对此进行极端讽刺)，称“华盛顿邮报”的报道具有“俄罗斯错误信息的经典标志”时，他可以故意这样做。但当格林沃尔德想要写一篇专栏文章质疑“关于拜登和缅甸的普遍看法”时，就会召集一组人。</p><p> “The only reason people are getting interested in and ready to scrutinize what I write is because everyone is afraid of being accused of having published something harmful to Biden,” Greenwald told them. “That’s the reality.”</p><p>格林沃尔德告诉他们：“人们之所以对我写的东西感兴趣，并准备仔细研究我的作品，唯一的原因就是每个人都害怕被指责发表了一些对拜登有害的东西。”“这就是现实。”</p><p>   Then Greenwald wrote the piece — essentially an opinion piece, drawing upon publicly available information. In it, he criticized the media response to the  Post story and noted, among other things, that the history of the Hunter Biden/Burisma story did not reflect well on any of the Bidens. Reed and Maass refused to publish it. Maass wrote:</p><p>然后格林沃尔德写了这篇文章-本质上是一篇评论文章，利用了公开的信息。在信中，他批评了媒体对“华盛顿邮报”报道的反应，并指出，亨特·拜登/缅甸故事的历史并没有很好地反映出拜登夫妇中的任何一个。里德和马斯拒绝发表这份报告。马斯写道：</p><p> Betsy agrees with me that the draft’s core problem is the connection it often asserts or assumes between the Hunter Biden emails and corruption by Joe Biden. There are many places in which the explicit or implied position is a) the emails expose corruption by Joe Biden and b) news organizations are suppressing their reporting on it. Those positions strike me as foundations to this draft, and they also strike me as inaccurate.</p><p>贝齐同意我的观点，即草案的核心问题是它经常断言或假定亨特·拜登的电子邮件与乔·拜登的腐败之间的联系。在许多地方，明确或暗示的立场是：a)这些电子邮件揭露了乔·拜登(Joe Biden)的腐败行为；b)新闻机构正在压制他们对此的报道。这些立场让我觉得是这份草案的基础，也让我觉得是不准确的。</p><p> Maass added that he didn’t believe Greenwald had done enough to address the “complexity” of the “disinformation issue”:</p><p>马斯补充说，他认为格林沃尔德在解决“虚假信息问题”的“复杂性”方面做得不够：</p><p> Lastly, I think the disinformation issue should be handled with greater complexity. I think it’s totally right to point out the haste with which some journalists and experts are talking about Russia’s hand. But the argument that some people make about disinformation, and that I think you should address, is the way the materials are being used by Giuliani, the rightwing media, and Trump, to support an exaggerated and false narrative – a narrative that is not supported by the materials themselves…</p><p>最后，我认为虚假信息问题应该以更复杂的方式处理。我认为指出一些记者和专家谈论俄罗斯之手过于仓促是完全正确的。但是，一些人对虚假信息提出的论点，我认为你应该解决的是，这些材料被右翼媒体朱利安尼和特朗普用来支持夸张和虚假的叙述-这种叙述没有得到材料本身的支持…</p><p> Maass suggested Greenwald cut the piece and stick to a narrower essay about whether or not the press was directly asking Biden enough questions. Another irony: Greenwald was trying to criticize the rush to describe the  Post story as disinformation, and Maass was essentially asking that he address the “disinformation issue,” even though the material’s veracity had not been denied, and the editors themselves didn’t seem to believe the laptop material was fake. Reed at one point wrote to Greenwald, “I agree with you that [the emails] appear to be mostly or entirely genuine, though authentication has been difficult in part because of the Biden camp’s refusal to address questions about authenticity.”</p><p>马斯建议格林沃尔德删掉这篇文章，坚持一篇范围更窄的文章，关于媒体是否直接向拜登提出了足够的问题。另一个具有讽刺意味的是：格林沃尔德试图批评匆忙将“华盛顿邮报”的报道描述为虚假信息，而马斯实质上是在要求他解决“虚假信息问题”，尽管这些材料的真实性并未被否认，编辑自己似乎也不相信笔记本电脑材料是假的。里德一度写信给格林沃尔德，“我同意你的看法，即(这些电子邮件)似乎大部分或全部是真实的，尽管认证一直很困难，部分原因是拜登阵营拒绝回答有关真实性的问题。”</p><p> Greenwald, by then furious, noted that neither Maass nor Reed had identified a factual inaccuracy in the article, but rather disagreed with its conclusions and his assessments of the facts — his “positions,” rather than his information.</p><p>格林沃尔德当时非常愤怒，他指出，马斯和里德都没有在文章中发现事实上的不准确，但他们更不同意文章的结论和他对事实的评估-他的“立场”，而不是他的信息。</p><p>  What a healthy and confident news organization would do -- as the  New York Times recently did with its own Pulitzer-winning 1619 Project -- is air the different views that journalists have about the evidence and let readers decide what they find convincing, not force everyone to adhere to a top-down editorial line and explicitly declare that any story that raises questions about Biden&#39;s conduct is barred from being published now that he&#39;s the Democratic nominee.</p><p>一个健康、自信的新闻机构--就像“纽约时报”(New York Times)最近在其普利策奖得主“1619项目”(The New York Times)上所做的那样--将记者们对证据的不同看法公之于众，让读者决定他们认为什么是有说服力的，而不是强迫每个人坚持自上而下的编辑路线，明确宣布，任何对拜登的行为提出质疑的报道，既然拜登是民主党提名人，就被禁止发表。</p><p> In the end, Maass and Reed would not budge, and Greenwald  resigned rather than accept what he described as being censored. The  Intercept quickly put out an icy statement describing him as a “ grown person throwing a tantrum,” adding that Greenwald was laboring under the assumption that “anyone who presumes to edit him is a censor.”</p><p>最终，马斯和里德不肯让步，格林沃尔德宁愿辞职，也不愿接受他所说的被审查。The Intercept很快发表了一份冷酷的声明，称他是一个“发脾气的成年人”，并补充说，格林沃尔德是在假设“任何假定编辑他的人都是审查员”的情况下工作的。</p><p> Anticipating the obvious criticism that the  Intercept had betrayed its founding mission, they wrote, “It is Glenn who has strayed from his original journalistic roots, not the  Intercept.” Mourning the reporter he “used to be,” the  Intercept editors defined the value that Glenn supposedly lost sight of as “an investigative mission… that involved a collaborative process.” In other words, absolute editorial freedom — but by group consent.</p><p>他们预料到明显会有人批评“拦截”背叛了它的创始使命，于是写道，“是格伦偏离了他最初的新闻根基，而不是”拦截“。”为了悼念这位“曾经”的记者，“拦截”杂志的编辑将格伦理应忽视的价值定义为“一项调查任务…”这涉及到一个合作的过程。“。换句话说，绝对的编辑自由--但要经过团体同意。</p><p> They then pulled out the go-to rhetorical device of media hall monitors in the Trump era, accusing him of being a secret Trump partisan, trying to “recycle… the Trump campaign’s… dubious claims, and launder them as journalism.”</p><p>然后，他们拿出了特朗普时代媒体大厅监督员的惯用修辞手段，指责他是特朗普的秘密党派成员，试图“循环使用…”特朗普竞选团队的…。令人怀疑的说法，并把它们当作新闻洗黑钱。“。</p><p> I reached out to both Reed and Maass for comment this afternoon. Neither has responded.</p><p>今天下午，我联系了里德和马斯，请他们发表评论。两人都没有回应。</p><p> In the last few weeks I’ve heard from multiple well-known journalists going through struggles in their newsrooms, with pressure to avoid certain themes in campaign coverage often central to their worries. There are many reporters out there — most of them quite personally hostile to Donald Trump — who are grating under what they perceive as relentless pressure to publish material favorable to the Democratic Party cause. Greenwald’s story mirrors some of these stories, but his is more striking than some others on a few levels.</p><p>在过去的几周里，我听到多位知名记者在他们的新闻编辑室里苦苦挣扎，他们担心的往往是在竞选报道中避免某些主题的压力。有很多记者-其中大多数人个人对唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump)怀有敌意-在他们看来，他们承受着发表有利于民主党事业的材料的无情压力。格林沃尔德的故事反映了其中的一些故事，但他的故事在几个层面上比其他一些故事更引人注目。</p><p> Many outside the media world will miss the subtleties of what makes this tale so crazy. Some may even think it’s unreasonable for a reporter to quit rather than “accept editing.” To understand why that’s not what’s going on here, one has to know the unique history of  The Intercept.</p><p>媒体界以外的许多人会怀念让这个故事如此疯狂的微妙之处。甚至有人认为，记者不“接受编辑”而辞职是不合理的。要理解为什么这不是这里正在发生的事情，人们必须了解拦截的独特历史。</p><p> On February 10th, 2014, Greenwald, documentarian Laura Poitras, and fellow reporter Jeremy Scahill  announced the creation of an aggressive new investigative outlet, backed by the deep pockets of eBay founder and billionaire Pierre Omidyar.</p><p>2014年2月10日，格林沃尔德、纪录片制片人劳拉·普瓦特拉斯(Laura Poitras)和记者杰里米·斯卡希尔(Jeremy Scahill)宣布，在eBay创始人兼亿万富翁皮埃尔·奥米迪亚(Pierre Omidyar)财力雄厚的支持下，创建了一个积极进取的新调查渠道。</p><p> It was big news in the media world. Greenwald and Poitras had been working on one of the great scoops in recent times, helping former NSA contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden  come forward about a secret,  illegal mass surveillance program conducted by the U.S. government. After bringing the story to light, Snowden was forced into exile, and Greenwald in particular became the subject of denunciations by colleagues and politicians alike, with some prominent officials  openly  calling for his prosecution and jailing.</p><p>这是媒体界的大新闻。格林沃尔德和普瓦特拉斯最近一直在进行一项伟大的独家新闻，帮助前美国国家安全局承包商和泄密者爱德华·斯诺登挺身而出，揭露美国政府实施的一个秘密、非法的大规模监控项目。在揭露了这件事后，斯诺登被迫流亡，尤其是格林沃尔德成为同事和政界人士谴责的对象，一些知名官员公开呼吁起诉和监禁他。</p><p> The  Intercept was designed specifically to be a place where journalists would be protected from such intimidation and editorial interference. As they wrote in their introduction:</p><p>截取是专门设计成一个保护记者免受这种恐吓和编辑干预的地方。正如他们在引言中所写的那样：</p><p> Over the past seven months the journalists who have reported on these documents from the National Security Agency have been  repeatedly threatened by a  wide range of government officials… None of this will deter the journalism we are doing. A primary function of  The Intercept is to insist upon and defend our press freedoms from those who wish to infringe them.</p><p>在过去的七个月里，从美国国家安全局报道这些文件的记者一再受到范围广泛的政府官员的威胁。…。所有这些都不会阻止我们正在做的新闻工作。拦截的一个主要功能是坚持和捍卫我们的新闻自由，使其不受那些想要侵犯它们的人的侵害。</p><p> Greenwald recalls today: “We saw in the media, reporters were quoting CIA officials about Snowden and about me. They were essentially stenographers. The  Intercept was created to avoid that.”</p><p>格林沃尔德今天回忆说：“我们在媒体上看到，记者们引用了中央情报局官员关于斯诺登和我的话。他们本质上是速记员。“拦截”就是为了避免这种情况而创建的。“。</p><p> Again as noted in the announcement six years ago,  Intercept writers were to be encouraged at all times to speak their minds, no matter who might take offense. This, they said, was another core part of the organization’s mission:</p><p>同样，正如六年前的声明中所指出的那样，无论谁可能会被冒犯，我们都将鼓励拦截作家在任何时候说出他们的想法。他们说，这是该组织使命的另一个核心部分：</p><p> The editorial independence of our journalists will be guaranteed… Our journalists will be not only permitted, but encouraged, to pursue stories  without regard to whom they might alienate.</p><p>我们的记者的编辑独立性将得到保证(…。我们的记者将不仅被允许，而且将被鼓励去追求报道，而不考虑他们可能会疏远谁。</p><p> The whole idea of  The Intercept was to create a hands-off, journalist-run enterprise where mistakes like the WMD fiasco could never happen. If the journalists themselves were put in charge, the thinking went, there could be no pressure from above to conform to clearly flawed official narratives like the WMD case, or to back off stories like the Snowden affair.</p><p>拦截的整个想法是创建一个不插手的、由记者经营的企业，在那里永远不会发生像大规模杀伤性武器惨败这样的错误。这种想法认为，如果记者自己负责，就不会有来自上级的压力，要求他们遵守像大规模杀伤性武器事件这样有明显缺陷的官方叙述，或者放弃像斯诺登事件这样的报道。</p><p> The traditional method of controlling the press — as described by legendary independent journalists like I.F. Stone — was the quiet aside by the boss, “ a little private talk,” where a “hint that the reporter seems irresponsible, a little bit radical” would be dropped. Getting the message, and fearing for his or her job, the reporter would back off. Or, in cases like the Iraq war runup, the strategic dismissal of a big name with the wrong views —  Phil Donahue,  Jesse Ventura — makes sure the rest of the employees get the message.</p><p>传统的控制媒体的方法--比如I.F.斯通(I.F.Stone)等传奇独立记者所说的--是老板安静的旁白，“一点私人谈话”，在这种情况下，“暗示记者似乎不负责任，有点激进”就会被丢弃。记者明白了这一点，担心自己的工作，就会退缩。或者，在伊拉克战争爆发这样的情况下，战略性解雇持有错误观点的大人物-菲尔·多纳休(Phil Donahue)、杰西·文图拉(Jesse Ventura)-确保其他员工明白这一信息。</p><p> Greenwald co-founded the  Intercept with this exact scenario in mind, building a structure where “little private talks” with bosses would never happen, and there couldn’t be high-profile dismissals for ideological reasons.</p><p>格林沃尔德与人共同创立了“拦截”，正是考虑到了这种情况，他建立了一种结构，在这种结构中，永远不会发生与老板的“小私下谈话”，也不会因为意识形态原因而被高调解雇。</p><p> What he didn’t guess at was that even in an atmosphere where managerial interference is near zero, a collective of independent journalists can themselves become censors and enforcers of official orthodoxies. In some cases, free journalists will become more aggressive propagandists and suppressors of speech than the officials from whom they supposedly need to be protected. This  Lord of the Flies effect is what happened with  The Intercept.</p><p>他没有想到的是，即使在管理层干预几乎为零的环境中，一群独立记者本身也可能成为官方正统的审查者和执行者。在某些情况下，自由记者将成为比他们理应受到保护的官员更具攻击性的宣传者和言论抑制者。这种“蝇王效应”就是在“拦截”中发生的。</p><p> It’s a long story, but the punchline is that the self-editing journalists at the  Intercept somewhere along the line began to fall for what will look, years from now, like a comically transparent bait-and-switch operation. They were suckered into becoming parodies of their original incarnation.</p><p>这是一个很长的故事，但笑点是，在截获的某个地方，自我编辑的记者们开始爱上了几年后看起来像是滑稽透明的诱饵和交换操作。他们上当受骗，成了对其最初化身的恶搞。</p><p> In the Obama years, progressive journalists were infuriated by the disclosures of whistleblowers like Snowden and Chelsea Manning, and aimed their professional ire at the federal government for war crimes, drone assassination, and mass abuse of surveillance authority. The bugbears of the day were intelligence officials who ran these programs and  deceived the public about them: people like CIA directors Hayden and Brennan, and Director of National Intelligence Clapper.</p><p>在奥巴马执政期间，进步的记者们对斯诺登和切尔西·曼宁等举报人的爆料感到愤怒，并将他们的职业愤怒指向联邦政府犯下的战争罪、无人机暗杀和大规模滥用监控权。当时令人头疼的是运行这些项目并在这些项目上欺骗公众的情报官员：像中央情报局局长海登和布伦南，以及国家情报总监克拉珀这样的人。</p><p> These intelligence community leaders only a few short years ago served an administration that sought a “reset” with the systematic human rights violator that was Vladimir Putin’s Russia, a country then-President Obama dismissed throughout his tenure as a “ regional power” that acts “not out of strength, but out of weakness.” The consistent posture of the Obama administration — the Obama-Biden administration — was that Russia ranked far below terrorists as a potential threat to the United States.</p><p>就在短短几年前，这些情报界领导人还在为寻求与弗拉基米尔·普京(Vladimir Putin)领导下的俄罗斯这个系统性侵犯人权者“重置”的政府服务，当时的奥巴马总统在整个任期内对俄罗斯不屑一顾，认为它是一个“不是出于强大，而是出于软弱”行事的“地区大国”。奥巴马政府-奥巴马-拜登政府-的一贯姿态是，俄罗斯对美国的潜在威胁远远低于恐怖分子。</p><p> After 2016, however, these officials presented themselves as norms-defending heroes protecting America against the twin “existential” threats of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. Russia, just a few years ago described by Rachel Maddow as a harmless “gnat on the butt of an elephant,” was now reinvented as an all-powerful foe mounting an influence campaign of unprecedented reach, with everyone from Trump to the Green Party to blogs like  Truthdig and Naked Capitalism, to congresswoman and war veteran Tulsi Gabbard, to Bernie Sanders, all potentially doing the bidding of a Cold War foe bent on “sowing discord” on our shores.</p><p>然而，在2016年后，这些官员将自己描绘成规范-捍卫英雄，保护美国免受唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump)和弗拉基米尔·普京(Vladimir Putin)双重“事关生死存亡”的威胁。就在几年前，被蕾切尔·麦道(Rachel Maddow)描述为无害的“大象屁股上的虫子”的俄罗斯，现在被重塑为一个全能的敌人，发起了一场影响范围空前的影响运动，从特朗普到绿党(Green Party)，到Truthdigy和Naked Capitism等博客，到国会女议员、退伍军人图尔西·加巴德(Tulsi Gabbard)，再到伯尼·桑德斯(Bernie Sanders)，所有这些都可能是在听从冷战对手的命令，一心想在我们的海岸上“挑拨离间”。</p><p>  A key part of this propaganda campaign was the continual insistence that any criticism of the Democratic Party was, in essence, aid and comfort to our Red Enemy. Would-be progressive journalists horrified by Donald Trump accepted this logic with enthusiasm. Over the course of four years they abandoned their traditional mistrust of the security state to transform themselves into a squad of little  Pavik Morozovs, anxious to stamp out traitors to the cause and keep the news business clean of “Russian” misinformation that might help Donald Trump get re-elected.</p><p>这场宣传运动的一个重要部分，就是始终坚持任何对民主党的批评，实质上都是对我们红敌的帮助和安慰。被唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump)吓坏了的准进步记者热情地接受了这一逻辑。在四年的时间里，他们放弃了对安全国家的传统不信任，将自己转变为一队小小的帕维克·莫罗佐夫(Pavik Morozov)，急于铲除这一事业的叛徒，并让新闻行业远离可能有助于唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump)连任的“俄罗斯”错误信息。</p><p> Greenwald never bought this line. In July of 2017, he reported on the  creation of new organizations like the Alliance For Securing Democracy, that united Bush-era neoconservatives like Jamie Fly with Democrats like Hillary Clinton foreign policy advisor Laura Rosenberger. Groups like this, and the Atlantic Council, advocated for more aggressive foreign policy aims and tighter controls over Internet content, using new paranoia about Russia as the glue for the expanding alliance.</p><p>格林沃尔德从来没买过这条线。2017年7月，他报道了安全民主联盟(Alliance For Secure Democratic)等新组织的成立，杰米等联合布什时代的新保守派与希拉里·克林顿(Hillary Clinton)外交政策顾问劳拉·罗森伯格(Laura Rosenberger)等民主党人一起飞行。像这样的组织和大西洋理事会(Atlantic Council)倡导更积极的外交政策目标，并对互联网内容进行更严格的控制，利用对俄罗斯的新偏执作为不断扩大的联盟的粘合剂。</p><p> As press enthusiasm for the Trump-Russia story widened, progressives began to invite old enemies back into the fold. People like “Axis of Evil” speechwriter David Frum and  Weekly Standard editor and key Iraq War proponent Bill Kristol became regular guests on CNN and MSNBC, while ex-spooks like Brennan, Clapper, Hayden, and a  long list of others were given TV contributor deals, now serving  as the press instead of facing criticism from it.</p><p>随着媒体对特朗普-俄罗斯故事的热情日益高涨，进步人士开始邀请宿敌重返圈子。“邪恶轴心”演讲稿撰稿人大卫·弗鲁姆(David Frum)和“旗帜周刊”(Weekly Standard)主编、伊拉克战争主要支持者比尔·克里斯托尔(Bill Kristol)等人成为CNN和MSNBC的常客，而布伦南、克拉珀、海登和其他一长串前间谍则获得了电视撰稿人的协议，现在担任媒体，而不是面临媒体的批评。</p><p> “The prevailing power center is Silicon Valley, Wall Street, and the Democratic Party,” Greenwald says. “In the Trump era, they managed to convince everyone to view anyone who opposes Trump as allies.”</p><p>“占主导地位的权力中心是硅谷、华尔街和民主党，”格林沃尔德说。“在特朗普时代，他们设法说服所有人将任何反对特朗普的人视为盟友。”</p><p> Greenwald’s opinions on these issues attracted indignation from former friends and colleagues alike, who denounced his criticism of Democrats as unpatriotic and unacceptably immoral behavior for an ethical reporter in the Trump era. He began to be criticized, by journalists, for refusing to take the word of secret services.</p><p>格林沃尔德在这些问题上的观点引起了以前朋友和同事的愤怒，他们谴责他对民主党人的批评是不爱国的，对于特朗普时代的一名道德记者来说，这是不可接受的不道德行为。他开始受到记者的批评，因为他拒绝接受特勤局的话。</p><p> When the  New Yorker wrote an  astonishingly vicious profile of Greenwald, describing his refusal to accept theories of Russian subversion as a pathology inspired by a difficult childhood and confusion over his sexuality, his nominal boss and co-worker, Reed, was happy to chime in about things Greenwald does that are “not helpful to the left.”</p><p>当“纽约客”(The New York Ker)写了一篇令人震惊的恶毒人物简介格林沃尔德时，他将拒绝接受俄罗斯颠覆理论描述为一种病态，原因是艰难的童年和对他性取向的困惑，他名义上的老板兼同事里德(Reed)很高兴地插话格林沃尔德做了一些“对左翼没有帮助”的事情。</p><p> She talked about Greenwald having inspired social media followers “who are so convinced that they are being lied to all the time that  anything that the intelligence community says can’t possibly be true.” She added that “it’s not helpful to the left and to all the candidates and causes we favor to continue to doubt the existence of some kind of relationship between Russia and the Trump campaign.”</p><p>她谈到格林沃尔德激励了社交媒体的追随者，“他们非常确信自己一直在被欺骗，情报界所说的任何事情都不可能是真的。”她补充说，“这对左翼和所有候选人都没有帮助，我们支持的理由是继续怀疑俄罗斯和特朗普竞选团队之间是否存在某种关系。”</p><p> Meanwhile, Greenwald’s former editor at  Salon, Joan Walsh, said Greenwald’s refusal to buy the Russia story was “motivated by real disdain for what the Democratic Party has become,” which she explained meant:</p><p>与此同时，格林沃尔德在沙龙的前编辑琼·沃尔什(Joan Walsh)表示，格林沃尔德拒绝购买俄罗斯报道的动机是“对民主党已经成为什么样的人真的不屑一顾”，她解释说，这是指：</p><p> The ascendance of women and people of color in the Party, and the fact that that coalition defeated  Bernie Sanders.</p><p>党内女性和有色人种的崛起，以及该联盟击败伯尼·桑德斯的事实。</p><p> All agreed that Greenwald couldn’t possibly just have a different opinion, or be insisting on seeing evidence before believing a collusion story that, by the way, turned out to be wrong. His ideas came from being sexually confused, misogynistic, racist, and financially desperate.</p><p>所有人都同意，格林沃尔德不可能只是有不同的观点，或者坚持在相信一个串通故事之前先看到证据，顺便说一句，事实证明这个故事是错误的。他的想法来自于性困惑、歧视女性、种族主义和经济上的绝望。</p><p> Or was it even worse? Glenn more than anyone got the treatment other reporters like myself, Aaron Mate, and Ken Vogel of the  New York Times got, for crossing established narratives on Russia or Ukraine: he was accused of being a Russian stooge, even a literal spy. His favorite critics on that score have been those same old, once-disgraced neoconservatives, as well as officials in the Democratic hierarchy, and, of course, other reporters:</p><p>还是更糟？格伦得到的待遇比任何人都多，因为他跨越了关于俄罗斯或乌克兰的既定叙事：他被指控是俄罗斯的走狗，甚至是字面上的间谍。其他记者如我、亚伦·马特(Aaron Mate)和“纽约时报”(New York Times)的肯·沃格尔(Ken Vogel)都受到了这样的待遇。在这方面，他最喜欢的批评者是那些曾经声名狼藉的老旧新保守派，以及民主党高层的官员，当然还有其他记者：</p><p>   Throughout the last four years, Greenwald has been one of the only people in the media world to speak out about some of the more preposterous claims made by Democratic Party partisans, from the pee tape to charges that  Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian asset to walked-back bombshell stories like the  Afghan bounty story. One of his consistent themes is that only a person like him, with fame and financial security, is able to safely challenge orthodoxies in this business.</p><p>在过去四年里，格林沃尔德一直是媒体界为数不多的直言不讳民主党党派人士提出的一些更荒谬说法的人之一，从尿带到指控图尔西·加巴德(Tulsi Gabbard)是俄罗斯的资产，再到阿富汗赏金故事等令人震惊的故事，格林沃尔德一直是其中之一。他一贯的主题之一是，只有像他这样的人，有名气和经济保障，才能安全地挑战这一行业的正统。</p><p> The significance of what’s happened with the  Intercept is that even journalists working in companies they founded  can’t get away from these pressures. For every public story like Greenwald’s, there are dozens more you don’t hear about, involving media members who can’t speak out. Not all of them are dealing with the same issues, but dynamics are often similar.</p><p>“拦截”事件的意义在于，即使是在他们创建的公司工作的记者也无法摆脱这些压力。对于每一个像格林沃尔德这样的公开故事，还有几十个你没有听说过的，涉及到不能说话的媒体成员。不是所有人都在处理相同的问题，但动态往往是相似的。</p><p> The  Intercept and many media outlets have gotten turned around by the Trump phenomenon. It’s a difficult time for reporters, with an unstable and potentially dangerous president. Some have been convinced to change the way they used to do business, to make sure they are not accused of having helped such a person get elected.</p><p>特朗普现象让The Intercept和许多媒体扭亏为盈。对于记者来说，这是一段艰难的时期，因为有一位不稳定且具有潜在危险的总统。一些人被说服改变他们过去做生意的方式，以确保他们不会被指控帮助这样的人当选。</p><p> Many in the press have therefore talked themselves into the proposition that questioning things like the Trump-Russia collusion theory, or the reflexive dismissal of adverse information about politicians like Biden as foreign disinformation, can have no purpose beyond pro-Trump partisanship. In service of this, they’ve surrendered their own traditional roles as questioners and arbiters of fact, giving that power over to the same people and institutions whose poor performance, record of deception, and corruption helped inspire voters to make such a desperate choice in Trump in the first place. They’ve not only allowed intelligence community narratives to drive the press, they’ve invited it.</p><p>因此，媒体中的许多人说服自己接受了这样的主张，即质疑特朗普与俄罗斯的串通理论，或者条件反射地将拜登等政客的不利信息斥为外国虚假信息，除了支持特朗普的党派偏见之外，没有任何目的。为此，他们放弃了自己作为事实提问者和仲裁者的传统角色，将权力交给了同样的人和机构，这些人和机构的糟糕表现、欺骗记录和腐败首先促使选民在特朗普身上做出了如此绝望的选择。他们不仅允许情报界的叙述推动媒体，而且还邀请了媒体。</p><p> When the likes of Brennan, Clap</p><p>当像Brennan，Clap这样的人</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://taibbi.substack.com/p/glenn-greenwald-on-his-resignation">https://taibbi.substack.com/p/glenn-greenwald-on-his-resignation</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/格林/">#格林</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/greenwald/">#greenwald</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/记者/">#记者</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
