Today, there are over 6,000 publicly available apps across the Shopify App Store, and on average, a merchant will use around six apps to run their business.\n Now, Shopify says it will drop its commissions on app developer revenue to 0%, down from 20%, for developers who make less than $1 million annually on its platform. This benchmark will also reset annually, giving developers \u2014 and, particularly those on the cusp of $1 million \u2014 more earning potential. And when Shopify\u2019s revenue share kicks in, it will now only be 15% of \u201cmarginal\u201d revenue. That means developers will pay 15% only on revenue they make that\u2019s over the $1 million mark.\n  The same business model will apply to Shopify\u2019s Theme Store, which opens to developer submissions July 15.\n As the two stores are separate entities, the $1 million revenue share metric applies to each store individually. The new business model will begin on August 1, 2021 and will be made available to developers who register by providing their account details in their partner dashboard.\n Shopify says the more developer-friendly business model will mean a drop in company revenue, but says it doesn\u2019t expect this impact \u201cto be material\u201d because it will encourage greater innovation and development.\n The changes to Shopify\u2019s App Store follow a shift in the broader app store market around developer commissions.\n Last year, amid increased\u00a0 regulatory\u00a0 scrutiny\u00a0over how it runs its App Store, Apple\u00a0 announced\u00a0it would reduce the App Store commissions for smaller businesses under a new program where developers earning up to $1 million per year would only have to pay a 15% commission on in-app purchases.  Google and  Amazon have since followed suit, each with their own particular spin on the concept. For example, in Google\u2019s case, the fee is 15% on the first million the developer earns. Amazon is still charging a higher percentage at 20%, but is tacking on AWS credits as a perk.\n Apple and Google, in particular, hope these changes can help shield them from antitrust investigations over their alleged app store monopolies, while also giving developers a better reason to participate in their own slice of the app economy.\n Outside of mobile, Microsoft this year agreed to  match the 12% cut on game sales that Epic Games takes on its Windows Store, as a means of increasing the pressure on its rivals. With the larger update to the new Windows 11 Store, it will allow developers to  use their own payment platforms, while keeping its commission at 15% on apps.\n To date, much of the momentum in the market has been focused on lowering the cut of app and games sales. Shopify\u2019s app platform is different \u2014 it\u2019s about apps that are used to enhance an e-commerce business, like those that help with shipping and delivery, marketing, merchandising, store design, customer service and more. These are not consumer-facing apps, but they are\u00a0 still \u00a0 marketed in an app store environment.\n While the changes to developers\u2019 businesses is the big news today from Unite 2021, that\u2019s not to diminish from the host of updates Shopify announced related to its larger platform.\n Among the updates are: the debut of\u00a0Online Store 2.0, a more flexible and customizable update to Shopify\u2019s Liquid platform (its  templating language), which  Netflix was the first to test; investments in custom storefronts for faster response times; a new React framework for building custom storefronts called Hydrogen; a way to host Hydrogen storefronts on Shopify called Oxygen; support for more Metafields for products and product variants and custom content that\u2019s built on top; speedier Spotify Checkout; Checkout Extensions (customizations built by developers); easier and more powerful Shopify Scripts; a Payments Platform for integrating third-party payment gateways into Checkout; updates to its Storefront API; and more.\n The company today also shared a few more business metrics, noting, for instance, that last year over 450 million people checked out on Shopify, totaling $120 billion in gross merchandise volume.

The company says it\u2019s currently on track to top $110 million USD in revenue this year for its app now used by over 28 million monthly users across 195+ countries. As of March 2021,\u00a0916,000 families are paying for Life360\u2019s service.\n The celeb investors along with Life360 will form the Family Advisory Council which will draw on the advisors\u2019 own family experiences to help inform feature developments and shape the future of the product and marketing strategy, Life360 says.\n  The company has been working to be more responsive to family members\u2019 concerns, as it wants to position its app as something all family members want to use \u2014 not just helicopter parents snooping on their kids. In fact, Life360 CEO Chris Hulls  took to TikTok last year to listen to teens\u2019 complaints about their lack of privacy, then used that to develop a more privacy-respecting feature called \u201cBubbles.\u201d The feature shows a bubble around a general location, not a blue dot with an exact location. This is meant to give teens a sense of the freedom they crave, while also helping parents and kids establish better trust.\n The new Family Advisory Council could help Life360 streamline similar sorts of input from families, it appears.\n \u201cInvesting and advising in companies is typically an adult thing, not something you do with your children,\u201d said Hulls, in a statement about the investment. \u201cWe\u2019re creating a unique opportunity to advise on a product side by side with your kids. Having the support of these icons speaks volumes to our long term vision to be the leading provider in family safety services. Life360 wants to create a brand that feels meaningful and relevant for both parents and kids. So it\u2019s only natural that we would ask our investors to participate in the same spirit,\u201d he added.\n \u201cOne of my passions is ensuring children get the opportunities they deserve,\u201d noted new investor, Vanessa Bryant (Kobe\u2019s widow). \u201cLife360 helps families feel safe and protected by making carpooling, pickup and drop-offs easier for parents, while also providing locations at their kids\u2019 schools, activities and sports practices. Having modern tools like driving information, speed and phone usage makes me feel a lot more at ease, especially with my teenage driver. I love the fact that I can see my daughter\u2019s location and speed in a vehicle whether she\u2019s driving or as a passenger,\u201d her statement said.\n Though best known for its location services, Life360 has been working to establish itself as more than just a family tracker, given the competition from apps like Find My that now come built into mobile devices, as well as services provided by mobile operators. Today, Life360\u2019s suite of family tools includes those for driving safety, emergency assistance, identity protection, and more.\n Earlier this year, Life360 also announced the  acquisition of wearable device maker Jiobit to expand its tracking abilities to include family members without phones, like young children and even pet.\n  The addition of the new investors follows Life360\u2019s  appointment of Randi Zuckerberg to its Board of Directors earlier this year, and last year\u2019s addition of new C-Suite execs, CFO Russell Burke and CPO Jonathan Benassaya, to focus on the company\u2019s business mode and product offerings, respectively.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 02:47:05", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "app,celebs,life360",

(Indian regulator, the Competition Commission of India, needs to approve the investment.) Zomato\u2019s proposed investment is part of a broader round, in which others including Tiger Global and SoftBank Vision Fund 2 are expected to chip in some capital. Zomato said it had no comment.\n The leadership teams at Grofers and Zomato have long been close friends and began exploring this investment earlier this year. Both the firms are also open to the idea of Zomato acquiring a majority stake in Grofers in the coming quarters, though a decision hasn\u2019t been reached and won\u2019t be fully explored until Zomato becomes a publicly traded company, the source told TechCrunch.\n  Zomato, which  acquired Uber\u2019s Indian food delivery business early last year, has told some of its major investors that it envisions a future where the Gurgaon-based firm has expanded much beyond the food delivery category, the source said, requesting anonymity as the talks are private.\n Grofers operates an online grocery delivery service in India. The startup has witnessed a sharp surge in its popularity in the past year as several Indian states enforced strict lockdown restrictions to contain the spread of the virus. The startup competes with BigBasket, which recently  sold its majority stake to Indian conglomerate Tata Group.\n The Indian online grocery market has seen a new player emerge in the past one year, Reliance Industries, India\u2019s most valuable firm. Reliance, which operates the largest retail chain in India, last year  launched JioMart.\n \u201cJioMart\u2019s growth is a testament to its already loyal customer base, 80% of whom are repeat shoppers. JioMart New commerce\u2019s aim is to transform and grow the small merchant ecosystem, so our merchant partners prosper. Over the past year, over 300,000 merchant or shopkeeper partners across 150 cities were enabled and empowered to transform their businesses both physically and digitally,\u201d said Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries, earlier this month.\n In a note to clients earlier this year, Bank of America analysts estimated that the online grocery delivery market could be worth $12 billion in India by 2023.\n \u201cCompetition is high in the sector with large verticals like BigBasket/Grofers and horizontal like Amazon/Flipkart trying to convert the unorganized market to organized one. Till recently the No 1 player in the space was BigBasket, with it hitting $1 billion annualized GMV &amp; selling over 300,000 orders every day. Reliance Industries also threw its hat with the company launching its JioMart app in May-20 across 200 cites,\u201d they wrote.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 02:46:49", "source_domain": "slashdot.org",

", "note_en": "Things are not looking good for LinkedIn right now. Just two months after a jaw-dropping 500 million profiles from the networking site were put up for sale on a popular hacker forum, a new posting with 700 million LinkedIn records has appeared.\n The seller, \u201cGOD User\u201d TomLiner, stated they were in possession of the 700 million records on June 22 2021, and included a sample of 1 million records on  RaidForums to prove their claims. Our researchers have viewed the sample and can confirm that the damning records include information such as full names, gender, email addresses, phone numbers, and industry information.\n We reached out to LinkedIn for verification and received this official statement from Leonna Spilman:\n \u201cWhile we\u2019re still investigating this issue, our initial analysis indicates that the dataset includes information scraped from LinkedIn as well as information obtained from other sources. This was not a LinkedIn data breach and our investigation has determined that no private LinkedIn member data was exposed. Scraping data from LinkedIn is a violation of our Terms of Service and we are constantly working to ensure our members\u2019 privacy is protected.\u201d\n   According to  a statement from LinkedIn, the previous data leak contained an \u201caggregation of data from a number of websites and companies\u201d as well \u201cpublicly viewable member profile data.\u201d However, it was not technically a breach since no private information was stolen.\n  This time around, it seems as though the records are, once again, a cumulation of data from previous leaks. However, this could still include information from both public and private profiles. We employ a strict policy of not supporting sellers of stolen data and, therefore, have not purchased the leaked list to verify all of the records.\n   The leaked information poses a threat to affected LinkedIn users. With details such as email addresses and phone numbers made available to buyers online, individuals could become the target of spam campaigns, or worse still, victims of identity theft.\n Even though the records don\u2019t appear to contain any information such as credit card details or private messages, expert hackers may still be able to track down sensitive data through just an email address. LinkedIn users could also be on the receiving end of email or telephone scams that trick them into sharing sensitive credentials or transferring large amounts of money.\n Brute force attacks are also something that LinkedIn users affected by the leak will need to be aware of. Using email addresses provided in the records, hackers may attempt to access users\u2019 accounts using various combinations of common password characters.\n Finally, targeted advertising towards specific users becomes much more probable thanks to this list. With information about users\u2019 jobs and gender, companies can more easily market their products to individuals.\n  Although password and email address combinations are not a part of this recent leak, it is a good idea to secure your LinkedIn account by updating your password and passwords for your other online accounts. Enabling two-factor authentication will also help prevent brute force attacks, which are a likely result of this recent data leak.\n You can also check whether or not your email address or telephone number has been involved in any data leaks by visiting  Have I Been Pwned.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 02:37:41", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6570\u636e,data,linkedin", "title": "700M LinkedIn\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5728\u8bba\u575b\u4e0a\u51fa\u552e\uff0c\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5982\u540d\u79f0\uff0c\u5730\u5740\uff0c\u63a8\u65ad\u85aa\u8d44; linkedin\u8bf4\uff0c\u4f3c\u4e4e\u4e00\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u6765\u81ea\u5176\u4ed6\u6765\u6e90 ", "title_en": "Data on 700M LinkedIn users for sale on a forum, with info like names, addresses, inferred salary; LinkedIn says it seems some of the data is from other sources", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.privacysharks.com/exclusive-700-million-linkedin-records-for-sale-on-hacker-forum-june-22nd-2021/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6570\u636e", "data", "linkedin"]}]
