According to CODA, there are channels with hundreds of uploads being viewed tens of millions of times, often with a for-profit motive. This means that they may fall outside traditional \u2018 fair use\u2018 style exceptions.\n  During our discussions with CODA our impression was that \u2018fast movie\u2019 uploaders would be dealt with sometime in the future but a few hours ago the anti-piracy group informed us that police in Japan had already sprung into action.\n During Wednesday, the Miyagi Prefectural Police Life Safety Division and the Shiogama Police Station arrested three suspects under suspicion of uploading \u2018fast movies\u2019 to YouTube without the rightsholders\u2019 consent. The arrests were reportedly carried out under the Copyright Act, which was boosted with  new amendments on January 1, 2021.\n \u201cFrom June to July 2020, the suspects edited \u2018I Am a Hero\u2019 and two other motion pictures owned by Toho Co., Ltd. as well as \u2018Cold Fish\u2019 and one other motion picture owned by Nikkatsu Corporation down to about 10 minutes without the permission of the right holders. Further, the suspects added narration and uploaded the videos to YouTube to earn advertising revenue,\u201d CODA explains.\n  \u201cFast movies are clear copyright infringement and serious crime that goes beyond the scope of legally permitted citation, however minor each act may seem,\u201d CODA informs TorrentFreak.\n \u201cFast movies including spoilers would discourage viewers from watching the original films and thus have a serious adverse effect on the right holders.\u201d\n In addition to uploaders who do not seek to gain financially, CODA says that some are effectively commercial operations, working at scale to utilize existing copyrighted movies in order to generate profit.\n \u201cThere are also malicious contributors who make a profit from advertising revenue, such as uploading 270 works and channels that are played about 80 million times in total. In addition, the content including spoilers leads to not watching the official main movie, and the influence on the right holder is enormous.\u201d\n An earlier report from  NHK indicates that the losses cited by rightsholders are huge \u2013 95 billion yen (US$ 856.7m) in the past 12 months alone, roughly $10 per \u2018fast movie\u2019 view when working in the 80 million views cited by CODA.\n  Copyright laws in the United States (where YouTube is based) differ from those in Japan, so it is not yet clear what type of action will be taken overseas. According to CODA, however, the rightsholders it represents are \u201cseriously concerned\u201d with the rise of \u2018fast movies\u2019 and although specifics cannot be provided at the moment, CODA will play a prominent role in any action taken.\n \u201cCODA shall co-operate with international enforcement partners to identify malicious account operators and consult with the police for successful criminal prosecution to wipe out \u2018fast movies\u2019,\u201d the anti-piracy group says.\n In respect of civil action, CODA says it is yet to apply for DMCA subpoenas in US courts to identify people uploading \u2018fast movies\u2019 to YouTube but it will be assisting rightsholders when that takes place, or when lawsuits are filed.\n  CODA informs TF that some channels have already begun removing their \u2018fast movies\u2019. Indeed, CODA sent us a number of links to channels that were accused of infringing the rights of MPA members studios (including Disney) but just a few hours later, these channels had disappeared from YouTube ( 1, 2).\n All of the channels shared by CODA appear to be operated from Japan but there is no shortage of YouTube channels operated from the US too.\n CODA doesn\u2019t name any of these as specific problems but they are undoubtedly popular with movie fans. Well put together, with commentary describing the films in some detail, some appear to have been in operation for years while also managing to evade YouTube\u2019s Content ID system.\n It will remain to be seen what legal remedies the studios have available to them outside Japan but in the meantime, CODA is encouraging movie fans not to visit \u2018fast movie\u2019 channels at all.\n \u201cCODA urges viewers to remember that viewing illicit videos would benefit the criminals indirectly and damage the interests of the right holders who create the original works,\u201d the anti-piracy group concludes.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 02:00:07", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "youtube,\u7535\u5f71,\u53d1\u5e03,\u8b66\u65b9,arrest", "title": "\u8b66\u65b9\u902e\u6355\u4e86\u4e09\u6b21\u5728YouTube\u4e0a\u53d1\u5e0310\u5206\u949f\u7535\u5f71\u6458\u8981 ", "title_en": "Police Arrest Three for Posting 10 Minute Movie Summaries on YouTube", "transed": 1, "url": "https://torrentfreak.com/police-arrest-three-for-posting-10-minute-movie-summaries-on-youtube-210623/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["youtube", "\u7535\u5f71", "\u53d1\u5e03", "\u8b66\u65b9", "arrest"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1068061, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u632a\u5a01\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u521a\u521a\u53d1\u8868\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u68a6\u5e7b\u822c\u7684\u65b0\u62a5\u544a\uff1a\u201c\u7981\u6b62\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u65f6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u201d\u4ece\u4ecb\u7ecd\uff1a\n \u5728\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7ae0\u8282\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u7684\u5404\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u4eca\u5929\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5e7f\u544a\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6a21\u5f0f\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u5bf9\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\uff0c\u6c11\u4e3b\u793e\u4f1a\uff0c\u5a92\u4f53\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5e7f\u544a\u5546\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u8db3\u591f\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u76f8\u4fe1\u73b0\u5728\u662f\u7981\u6b62\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u5229\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\n \u7981\u6b62\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u5e94\u91c7\u53d6\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u73b0\u884c\u7acb\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u822c\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u76d1\u7ba1\uff0c\u7ade\u4e89\u76d1\u7ba1\u548c\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u60ef\u4f8b\u6307\u4ee4\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6267\u6cd5\u76ee\u524d\u6d88\u8017\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u635f\u574f\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b8c\u6210\u540e\u53d1\u751f\u3002\u4e00\u822c\u7981\u6b62\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u5c06\u5f3a\u8feb\u5bf9\u5e7f\u544a\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u5bf9\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u548c\u5927\u793e\u4f1a\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u91cd\u5927\u5371\u5bb3\u3002\n \u7981\u6b62\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u5e76\u4e0d\u610f\u5473\u7740\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u5e7f\u544a\u4e0d\u518d\u878d\u8d44\u6570\u5b57\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u8bf4\u660e\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u5e7f\u544a\u8d44\u52a9\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u66f4\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u5e7f\u544a\u6280\u672f\u3002 ", "note_en": "The Norwegian Consumer Council just published a fantastic new report: \u201c Time to Ban Surveillance-Based Advertising.\u201d From the Introduction:\n In the following chapters, we describe various aspects of these challenges and point out how today\u2019s dominant model of online advertising is a threat to consumers, democratic societies, the media, and even to advertisers themselves. These issues are significant and serious enough that we believe that it is time to ban these detrimental practices.\n A ban on surveillance-based practices should be complemented by stronger enforcement of existing legislation, including the General Data Protection Regulation, competition regulation, and the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. However, enforcement currently consumes significant time and resources, and usually happens after the damage has already been done. Banning surveillance-based advertising in general will force structural changes to the advertising industry and alleviate a number of significant harms to consumers and to society at large.\n A ban on surveillance-based advertising does not mean that one can no longer finance digital content using advertising. To illustrate this, we describe some possible ways forward for advertising-funded digital content, and point to alternative advertising technologies that may contribute to a safer and healthier digital economy for both consumers and businesses.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 01:59:55", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5e7f\u544a,\u76d1\u89c6,surveillance,\u6d88\u8d39\u8005", "title": "\u7981\u6b62\u57fa\u4e8e\u76d1\u89c6\u7684\u5e7f\u544a ", "title_en": "Banning Surveillance-Based Advertising", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2021/06/banning-surveillance-based-advertising.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5e7f\u544a", "\u76d1\u89c6", "\u6d88\u8d39\u8005"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "8f94fcff8cc451f1e6af986acee561ea.jpg", "infoid": 1068059, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u610f\u89c1\uff1a\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u5e38\u8010\u7528\u7684\u65bd\u5de5\u6750\u6599\u3002\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u5927\u7684\u672a\u6210\u65e5\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u5706\u9876\u7f57\u9a6c\u7684\u5b8f\u4f1f\u4e07\u795e\u6bbf\uff0c\u5728\u8fd11,900\u5e74\u540e\u5904\u4e8e\u51fa\u8272\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6765\u81ea\u4e0a\u4e16\u7eaa\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784 -

The magnificent\u00a0 Pantheon\u00a0in Rome, the world\u2019s largest unreinforced concrete dome, is in excellent condition after nearly 1,900 years. And yet many concrete structures from last century \u2013 bridges, highways and buildings \u2013 are crumbling. Many concrete structures built this century will be obsolete before its end.\n Given the survival of ancient structures, this may seem curious. The critical difference is the modern use of steel reinforcement, known as\u00a0 rebar, concealed within the concrete. Steel is made mainly of iron, and one of iron\u2019s unalterable properties is that it rusts. This ruins the durability of concrete structures in ways that are difficult to detect and costly to repair.\n While repair may be justified to preserve the architectural legacy of iconic 20th-century buildings, such as those designed by\u00a0 reinforced concrete users like Frank Lloyd Wright, it is questionable whether this will be affordable or desirable for the vast majority of structures. The writer Robert Courland, in his book\u00a0 Concrete Planet, estimates that repair and rebuilding costs of concrete infrastructure, just in the United States, will be in the trillions of dollars \u2013 to be paid by future generations.\n   Steel reinforcement was a dramatic innovation of the 19th century. The steel bars add strength, allowing the creation of long, cantilevered structures and thinner, less-supported slabs. It speeds up construction times, because less concrete is required to pour such slabs.\n These qualities, pushed by\u00a0 assertive and sometimes duplicitous promotion by the concrete industry\u00a0in the early 20th century, led to its massive popularity.\n Reinforced concrete competes against more durable building technologies, like steel frame or traditional bricks and mortar. Around the world, it has replaced environmentally sensitive, low-carbon options like mud brick and\u00a0 rammed earth\u00a0\u2013 historical practices that may also be more durable.\n Early 20th-century engineers thought reinforced concrete structures would last a very long time \u2013 perhaps 1,000 years. In reality, their life span is more like 50-100 years, and sometimes less. Building codes and policies generally require buildings to survive for several decades, but deterioration can begin in\u00a0 as little as 10 years.\n Many engineers and architects point to the natural affinities between steel and concrete: they have similar thermal expansion characteristics, and concrete\u2019s alkalinity can help to inhibit rust. But there is still a lack of knowledge about their composite qualities \u2013 for example, in regard to\u00a0 sun-exposure-related changes in temperature.\n The many alternative materials for concrete reinforcement \u2013 such as stainless steel, aluminium bronze and fibre-polymer composites \u2013 are not yet widely used. The affordability of plain steel reinforcement is attractive to developers. But many planners and developers fail to consider the\u00a0 extended costs of maintenance, repair or replacement.\n   There are technologies that can address the problem of steel corrosion, such as\u00a0 cathodic protection, in which the entire structure is connected to a rust-inhibiting electric current. There are also interesting new methods to monitor corrosion, by\u00a0 electrical\u00a0or\u00a0 acousticmeans.\n Another option is to treat the concrete with a rust-inhibiting compound, although these can be toxic and inappropriate for buildings. There are several new non-toxic inhibitors, including\u00a0 compounds extracted from bamboo\u00a0and\u00a0 bacterially derived \u201cbiomolecules\u201d.\n Fundamentally, however, none of these developments can resolve the inherent problem that putting steel inside concrete ruins its potentially great durability.\n  This has serious repercussions for the planet. Concrete is the third-largest contributor to carbon dioxide emissions, after automobiles and coal-fuelled power plants. Cement manufacturing alone is responsible for\u00a0 roughly 5% of global CO\u2082 emissions. Concrete also makes up the largest proportion of construction and demolition waste, and represents about a third of all landfill waste.\n Recycling concrete is\u00a0 difficult and expensive,\u00a0 reduces its strength\u00a0and may catalyse chemical reactions that speed up decay. The world needs to reduce its concrete production, but this will not be possible without building longer-lasting structures.\n   In a recent paper, I suggest that the widespread acceptance of reinforced concrete may be the expression of a traditional, dominant and ultimately destructive view of matter as inert. But reinforced concrete is not really inert.\n Concrete is commonly perceived as a stone-like, monolithic and homogeneous material. In fact, it is a complex mix of cooked limestone, clay-like materials and a wide variety of rock or sandy aggregates. Limestone itself is a sedimentary rock composed of shells and coral, whose formation is influenced by many biological, geological and climatological factors.\n This means that concrete structures, for all their stone-like superficial qualities, are actually made of the skeletons of sea creatures ground up with rock. It takes millions upon millions of years for these sea creatures to live, die and form into limestone. This timescale contrasts starkly with the life spans of contemporary buildings.\n Steel is often perceived to be inert and resilient too. Terms such as \u201cIron Age\u201d suggest an ancient durability, although Iron Age artefacts are comparatively rare precisely because they rust. If construction steel is visible, it can be maintained \u2013 for instance, when the Sydney Harbour Bridge is\u00a0 repeatedly painted and repainted.\n However, when embedded in concrete, steel is hidden but secretly active. Moisture entering through thousands of tiny cracks creates an electrochemical reaction. One end of the rebar becomes an anode and the other a cathode, forming a \u201cbattery\u201d that powers the transformation of iron into rust. Rust can expand the rebar up to four times its size, enlarging cracks and forcing the concrete to fracture apart in a process called\u00a0 spalling, more widely known as \u201cconcrete cancer\u201d.\n    I suggest that we need to change our thinking, to recognise concrete and steel as\u00a0 vibrant and active materials. This is not a case of changing any facts, but rather of re-orientating how we understand and act on those facts. Avoiding waste, pollution and needless rebuilding will require\u00a0 thinking well beyond disciplinary conceptions of time, and this is especially true for the building and construction industries.\n The collapsed civilisations of the past show us the consequences of short-term thinking. We should focus on building structures that stand the test of time \u2013 lest we end up with hulking, derelict artefacts that are no more fit for their original purpose than the statues of\u00a0 Easter Island.\n Guy Keulemans is an associate lecturer, Art &amp; Design Research,\u00a0UNSW.

evidence that a coronavirus epidemic swept East Asia some 20,000 years ago and was devastating enough to leave an evolutionary imprint on the DNA of people alive today.\n  The new  study suggests that an ancient coronavirus plagued the region for many years, researchers say. The finding could have dire implications for the Covid-19 pandemic if it\u2019s not brought under control soon through vaccination.\n \u201cIt should make us worry,\u201d said David Enard, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona who led the study, which was published on Thursday in the journal Current Biology. \u201cWhat is going on right now might be going on for generations and generations.\u201d\n Until now, researchers could not look back very far into the history of this family of pathogens. Over the past 20 years, three coronaviruses have adapted to infect humans and cause severe respiratory disease: Covid-19, SARS and MERS. Studies on each of these coronaviruses indicate that they jumped into our species from bats or other mammals.\n Four other coronaviruses can also infect people, but they usually cause only mild colds. Scientists did not directly observe these coronaviruses becoming human pathogens, so they have relied on indirect clues to estimate when the jumps happened. Coronaviruses gain new mutations at a roughly regular rate, and so comparing their genetic variation makes it possible to determine  when they diverged from a common ancestor.\n The most recent of these mild coronaviruses, called HCoV-HKU1, crossed the species barrier in the 1950s. The oldest, called HCoV-NL63, may date back as far as 820 years.\n But before that point, the coronavirus trail went cold \u2014 until Dr. Enard and his colleagues applied a new method to the search. Instead of looking at the genes of the coronaviruses, the researchers looked at the effects on the DNA of their human hosts.\n Over generations, viruses drive enormous amounts of change in the human genome. A mutation that protects against a viral infection may well mean the difference between life and death, and it will be passed down to offspring. A lifesaving mutation, for example, might allow people to chop apart a virus\u2019s proteins.\n But viruses can evolve, too. Their proteins can change shape to overcome a host\u2019s defenses. And those changes might spur the host to evolve even more counteroffensives, leading to more mutations.\n When a random new mutation happens to provide resistance to a virus, it can swiftly become more common from one generation to the next. And other versions of that gene, in turn, become rarer. So if one version of a gene dominates all others in large groups of people, scientists know that is most likely a signature of rapid evolution in the past.\n In  recent years, Dr. Enard and his colleagues have searched the human genome for these patterns of genetic variation in order to reconstruct the history of an array of viruses. When the pandemic struck, he wondered whether ancient coronaviruses had left a distinctive mark of their own.\n He and his colleagues compared the DNA of thousands of people across 26 different populations around the world, looking at a combination of genes  known to be crucial for coronaviruses but not other kinds of pathogens. In East Asian populations, the scientists found that 42 of these genes had a dominant version. That was a strong signal that people in East Asia had adapted to an ancient coronavirus.\n But whatever happened in East Asia seemed to have been limited to that region. \u201cWhen we compared them to populations around the world, we couldn\u2019t find the signal,\u201d said Yassine Souilmi, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Adelaide in Australia and a co-author of the new study.\n The scientists then tried to estimate how long ago East Asians had adapted to a coronavirus. They took advantage of the fact that once a dominant version of a gene starts being passed down through the generations, it can gain harmless random mutations. As more time passes, more of those mutations accumulate.\n Dr. Enard and his colleagues found that the 42 genes all had about the same number of mutations. That meant that they had all rapidly evolved at about the same time. \u201cThis is a signal we should absolutely not expect by chance,\u201d Dr. Enard said.\n They estimated that all of those genes evolved their antiviral mutations sometime between 20,000 and 25,000 years ago, most likely over the course of a few centuries. It\u2019s a surprising finding, since East Asians at the time were not living in dense communities but instead formed small bands of hunter-gatherers.\n Aida Andres, an evolutionary geneticist at the University College London who was not involved in the new study, said she found the work compelling. \u201cI\u2019m quite convinced there\u2019s something there,\u201d she said.\n Still, she didn\u2019t think it was possible yet to make a firm estimate of how long ago the ancient epidemic took place. \u201cThe timing is a complicated thing,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether that happened a few thousand years before or after \u2014 I personally think it\u2019s something that we cannot be as confident of.\u201d\n Scientists looking for drugs to fight the new coronavirus might want to scrutinize the 42 genes that evolved in response to the ancient epidemic, Dr. Souilmi said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually pointing us to molecular knobs to adjust the immune response to the virus,\u201d he said.\n Dr. Anders agreed, saying that the genes identified in the new study should get special attention as targets for drugs. \u201cYou know that they\u2019re important,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the nice thing about evolution.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-25 01:58:36", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

", "note_en": "The financing values New York-based SmartAsset at over $1 billion, and brings its total raised since its 2012 inception to just over $161 million, according to  Crunchbase.\n TTV Capital led SmartAsset\u2019s Series D, which also included participation from Javelin Venture Partners, Contour Venture Partners, Citi Ventures, New York Life Ventures, North Bridge Venture Partners and CMFG Ventures.\n  The company last raised in June of 2018 \u2013 a $28 million Series C led by Focus Financial Partners. Since then, it says it has grown revenue \u201cby 10 times\u201d and is now on the cusp of reaching $100 million in ARR (annual recurring revenue). It recently made its one millionth consumer/advisor match on its  SmartAdvisor platform. Also in 2020, SmartAsset says it referred $10 billion in new, closed assets under management (AUM) to financial advisors and firms across the U.S.\n  Besides pairing consumers with advisors with its Automated Financial Modeling software, SmartAsset claims to reach over 100 million people each month through its personal finance content, tools and \u201cpersonalized\u201d calculators.\n Prior to starting the company, Carvin worked in finance. In  an interview with Y Combinator (one of its backers), he shared how his frustration in finding information about buying a home and getting a mortgage \u201cthat was useful, accurate and unbiased\u201d led him to join forces with Philip Camilleri to found SmartAsset.\n \u201cCalculators had obvious errors and the content seemed like it was all written by people that wanted me to take out the largest mortgage possible,\u201d he added. So the pair launched SmartAsset in an effort to provide people with the tools and content to help them make better decisions around topics such as retirement, taxes, savings, homeownership and insurance.\n The company plans to use the new capital to invest in new product offerings, technology infrastructure and data partnerships. It also plans to boost its current headcount of 202 by more than 75% this year.\n TTV Capital Partner Mark Johnson said the company \u201cis quickly expanding its lead in one of the largest markets in the U.S. by providing an incredibly valuable resource for both consumers and financial advisors alike.\u201d\n The funding and its flashy valuation comes with a certain weight, even in the growing world of unicorn companies.\n The company  claims that, with today\u2019s news, co-founder Michael Carvin now becomes the fourth Black founder and CEO of a company valued at over $1 billion. Others include Compass CEO and founder Robert Reffkin, whom we recently profiled  here, and Calendly CEO and founder Tope Awotona,  who we have also profiled.\n While exciting, the unfortunate rarity of Black-led unicorns is a symptom of historical underfunding in Black or African-American startup founders. Crunchbase estimates that in 2020, 1% of total venture capital funding, or $1 billion, went to this cohort of founders.\n A number of Black-led venture capital firms have closed investments in the past year, which could change this number, including  Collab Capital\u2019s $50 million investment vehicle,\u00a0Harlem Capital, which  closed a $134 million seed fund\u00a0earlier this year; Cleo Capital, which set a \u00a0$20 million target for Fund II; and MaC VC, which\u00a0 landed $103 million for its inaugural fund.\n HBCUvc and Google for Startups also announced this month two separate efforts to provide non-dilutive capital to early-stage, underrepresented founders.\n With a Series D under its belt, SmartAsset is working on taking out the bias from personal finance \u2013 while it itself is a case study in how overlooked founders, which routinely suffer from this exact phenomenon, continue to lead strong businesses.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 01:17:30", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651,rethinks,\u521b\u59cb\u4eba", "title": "SmartAsset\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u8d22\u52a1\u54a8\u8be2\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u4e3a\u8be5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u72ec\u89d2\u517d ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tSmartAsset rethinks financial advisory, and becomes a unicorn in the process\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/smartasset-rethinks-financial-advisory-and-becomes-a-unicorn-in-the-process/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651", "rethinks", "\u521b\u59cb\u4eba"]}]
