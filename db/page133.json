A customer used their support contract to ask   how to change among the three levels of play in Space Cadet Pinball. My proudest achievement of Windows XP was   fixing the game so it didn\u2019t consume 100% CPU. People keep asking   if it can be brought back.\n One point of contention is over my claim that   I removed Pinball from Windows because I couldn\u2019t get the 64-bit version to work. Retrocomputing enthusiast   NCommander even undertook a   Zapruder-level analysis of all of the 64-bit versions of Windows he could find to prove or disprove my story.\n I was amazed at the level of thoroughness (and the fortitude it required to get those Itanium systems up and running, much less debug them), but there\u2019s one version of 64-bit Windows that NCommander didn\u2019t try out, and that\u2019s the one that\u2019s relevant to the story.\n When the 64-bit Windows project started, there was no Itanium hardware yet. The only way you could run any Itanium code was to run it in a simulator. Booting Windows on an Itanium simulator took forever. Clearly not the development environment you wanted when porting millions of lines of code.\n On the other hand, the Windows team did have access to a lot of copies of another 64-bit processor: The Alpha AXP.\n In 1999, Compaq announced that   it would no longer support Windows on the Alpha AXP, which left a lot of Windows team members with cumbersome paperweights on their desks.\n  \n The Alpha AXP is internally a 64-bit processor. It\u2019s just that 32-bit Windows used only the 32-bit subset.\n  Now, 64-bit Windows on the Alpha AXP would never ship. But the Alpha AXP did have the advantage of  existing in physical form, so the system could finish booting before the heat death of the universe. The assumption is that most of the effort in porting Windows to the Itanium is in the 32-bit to 64-bit transition, and not in dealing with quirks of the specific 64-bit processor you are porting to.\n The assumption was somewhat validated by experience: The 32-bit Windows code base had been ported to many 32-bit processors, with relatively few architecture-specific issues. Once you got a 64-bit version of Windows working for the Alpha AXP, it should be a comparatively small amount of additional work to port it to Itanium. The hard part was going from 32-bit to 64-bit.\n The team set to work, and we had 64-bit Windows running on physical Alpha AXP hardware long before we had any physical Itanium hardware. I could test my 64-bit port on a physical Alpha AXP system to validate that it was successful. And that\u2019s the system that had the broken collision detector.\n NCommander did find a collision detection bug on the Itanium, although that bug was nowhere as severe as the one that existed on the Alpha AXP. My guess is that it had to do with the default rounding mode established by the C runtime library.\n My theory as to what happened is that some time after I removed Pinball from the product, the C runtime team realized that they had a compatibility bug in the way they set the default rounding mode, and they fixed it. Or maybe there was a compiler bug, and the compiler team fixed that. Whatever the problem was, somebody fixed it, and then they went back and re-tested Pinball with this fix, and everything worked great, so they put Pinball back.\n I\u2019m just guessing about what happened afterward because nobody informed me that they had gotten Pinball working and added it back. I just assumed that it was gone forever.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 03:25:42", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "windows,\u7a7a\u95f4,gaps,cadet", "title": "\u572864\u4f4d\u7a97\u53e3\u4e0a\u586b\u5145\u7a7a\u95f4Cadet Pinball\u6545\u4e8b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u7a7a\u767d", "title_en": "Filling in some gaps in the story of Space Cadet Pinball on 64-bit Windows", "transed": 1, "url": "https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20220106-00/?p=106122", "via": "", "real_tags": ["windows", "\u7a7a\u95f4", "gaps", "cadet"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "2f96b034c675a9ba40e7c30ea4bd03d5.png", "infoid": 1072544, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u987e\u540d\u601d\u4e49\uff0c\u7535\u6e90\u8fdc\u7a0b\u684c\u9762\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u4ee5PowerShell\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u8fdc\u7a0b\u684c\u9762\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\n\u6211\u8fd8\u5c06\u63d0\u9ad8\u6ce8\u91ca\u548c\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08\u8be6\u7ec6/\u6b63\u5e38\u6587\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c1d\u8bd5\u652f\u6301\u5149\u6807\u72b6\u6001\u76d1\u89c6\u5668\uff08\u5728\u67e5\u770b\u5668\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5149\u6807\u72b6\u6001\uff09\u3002\n\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u5c3d\u529b\u51c6\u5907\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cPhrozen Sasu\u4e0d\u80fd\u4e0d\u8bb2\u8fc7\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0cPhrozen SASU\u4e0d\u5f97\u8d23\u4efb\u4efb\u4f55\u635f\u5931\u548c/\u6216\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6709\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "note_en": "As the name suggests, Power Remote Desktop is a Remote Desktop application entirely coded in PowerShell.\n It does not rely in any existing remote desktop application / protocol to function.

This change allowed us to do a major code cleanup and migrate to some newer methods in different areas which are only available on Buster and above.\n Debian 9 \u201cStretch\u201d was released in 2017, and it has been initially superseded by Debian 10 \u201cBuster\u201d, and then Debian 11 \u201cBullseye\u201d.\n DietPi v7.9 was the last release with support for Debian Stretch.  DietPi v8.0 and later require Debian Buster or newer.\n Read our article   Why you should upgrade your Stretch system now to learn more about the need to make this upgrade and you could do this easily to Debian Buster and even further to latest version ( Debian Bullseye).\n  Network    For new images, the default DHCP timeout is not reduced to 10 seconds anymore. This could have been too short, in which case network targets of the boot sequence are reached before an IP has been actually assigned. Especially in case of  AUTO_SETUP_AUTOMATED=1 this could have lead to connection test timeouts and hence abortion of the automated first run setup. Many thanks to  @jpeg2600 for reporting such a case:  MichaIng/DietPi#5143\n DietPi-Config    When configuring a first WiFi slot via scanning for SSIDs, the WiFi adapter is now not brought up via  ifup but  ip l dev wlanX up. This way no DHCP and WPA client starts are triggered, which are doomed to fail when the WiFi adapter is not connected to any access point yet. Especially in case of the default 60 seconds DHCP timeout, this would otherwise cause an unnecessary long delay.\n DietPi-Dashboard    Added an option to view multiple dashboard nodes from one frontend web interface. Related to this, the backend can now be installed only, reducing memory usage and making it impossible to manually access the node outside of the backend API.\n DietPi-Print_large    This new script has been added which can be executed or sourced from  /boot/dietpi/func/dietpi-print_large to print the string passed via first argument in large  figlet style fonts. It currently only supports the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, dot and dash, i.e. those commonly allowed in hostnames.\n DietPi-Banner    Added an option to print the system\u2019s hostname in large  figlet style fonts, right below the banner header. In case it is enabled as well, the regular/small hostname line will then be skipped. Many thanks to  @matellis for implementing this feature:\n DietPi-Software |  Mono    mono-complete won\u2019t be installed anymore but only  mono-devel instead. This skips the  XSP4 webserver service, which listens on port 8084 by default where it conflicts with File Browser. This only affects new installations. You can manually apply this change running next command:\n DietPi-Software |   FuguHub    The outdated official installer has been replaced with a fully automated own setup, removing the obsolete or even harmful interactive dialogues. On fresh installs, an admin account  dietpi with global software password is created as well.\n DietPi-Software |   myMPD    Installation is now done via official APT repository, which means quicker install compared to compiling from source, fewer dependencies and easier updates via  apt upgrade:  MichaIng/DietPi#5115\n DietPi-Software |   Airsonic    Since the project has been archived by its maintainer and suffers from the critical  Log4Shell security vulnerability, we moved to the advertised fork \u201cAirsonic-Advanced\u201d which also enables compatibility with Java 17 and hence Debian Bullseye. Airsonic will be reinstalled as part of the DietPi update to apply the migration. All data and settings will be preserved and migrated automatically.\n DietPi images |   Parallels Desktop (macOS)    New Virtual Machine image for Parallels Desktop on macOS.\n  Raspberry Pi    Resolved an issue where unintentionally the turbo mode was enabled. This got backported to v7.9, to our existing RPi images and via live patch. Many thanks to  @ayo-x and  @whyisthisbroken for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5088\n DietPi-FS_partition_resize    Resolved an issue where in some cases the boot partition failed to mount on first boot since after the partition resize the system in some cases didn\u2019t get sufficient time to fully apply the change before continuing with the boot mount attempt. Many thanks to  @Mausy5043 and  @sistemicorp for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5006\n DietPi-Config    Resolved an issue where on Raspberry Pi, when the full KMS display driver is used, the sound card selection could have been falsely applied. With full KMS enabled, for each HDMI port an additional HDMI sound card appears (replacing the regular firmware HDMI sound device), even when no HDMI device is attached and with onboard audio disabled. This lead to an increase of external sound card indices. The appearance of the KMS HDMI sound cards is now aligned with the onboard firmware HDMI sound cards, i.e. if not onboard  auto or HDMI is selected in  dietpi-config, now the KMS HDMI sound devices are disabled as well, making use of the  noaudio device tree overlay parameter.\n DietPi-Software Resolved an issue where on first boot, choice and preference menu selections triggered an error as the install state file did not exist yet. Many thanks to  @bsheeres for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5080\n Resolved an issue where the deprecated  AUTO_SETUP_FILE_SERVER_INDEX option in  dietpi.txt file was applied inverted.  -1 should have installed  ProFTPD and  -2 Samba, while it was done the opposite way. However, note that this setting is not present on current images and deprecated. Use  AUTO_SETUP_INSTALL_SOFTWARE_ID instead to mark any one or multiple file servers for automatic install. Many thanks to  @bsheeres for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5081\n Browsers - On the ARMv6 Raspberry Pi models Raspberry Pi 1 and Zero (1) since Bullseye,  Chromium and  Firefox fail to start due to hardware and build limitations which are outside of our control. Since those are currently the only two browser available from  dietpi-software, they have been disabled together with the browser preference menu for those systems, until we find and implement a good additional compatible browser. Further info:  RPi-Distro/chromium-browser#21.\n DietPi-Software |   Kodi    Resolved an issue where subsequent Kodi reinstalls created duplicates of the  CMA parameter for the KMS overlay setting in  config.txt. The duplicates are patched out during DietPi update.\n DietPi-Software |   Docker    Resolved an issue where the install was aborted due to an incorrect check for missing kernel modules. Many thanks to  @dragonandy for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5061\n DietPi-Software |   Pi-hole    Resolved an issue where the teleporter import log was not shown but denied by the X-Frame-Options header:  https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/unable-to-restore-teleporter-backup-fresh-install-no-funky-changes-made/51573\n DietPi-Software |   Blynk Server    Resolved an issue on ARMv6 RPi models where the install failed as the latest Blynk Server release does not contain a Java 8 build. Since the older Java 8 build does not contain a native Log4Shell vulnerability mitigation, it is added server-wise on these systems.\n DietPi-Software |   Mycroft AI    Resolved an issue on Bullseye (and above) systems where  mycroft-cli-client command fails with a permissions issue, even as root user. Many thanks to  @berndverhofstadt for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5100\n DietPi-Software |   Nukkit    Resolved an issue where the install failed due to a changed download URL. The Jenkins instance has moved to  ci.opencollab.dev, where also the Geyser and Floodgate projects are hosted.\n DietPi-Software |   FuguHub    Resolved an issue where the uninstall failed as the process was not stopped as intended. Many thanks to  @kd9352 for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5058\n DietPi-Software |   myMPD    Resolved an issue where the installation failed due to an updated dependency. Many thanks to  @supersexy for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5115\n DietPi-Software |   Python 3    Worked around an issue where the  pip reinstall failed. Many thanks to  @hueppinr for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5117\n DietPi-Software |   Unbound    Resolved an issue where the  unbound-resolvconf service applied localhost automatically as local name server, if the  resolvconf package was installed. Since often Unbound is installed in combination with Pi-hole or AdGuard Home, and those are usually used by network clients only, not the server itself,  unbound-resolvconf is disabled now on Unbound installs. If Unbound is wanted as local resolver as well, it should be explicitly configured, e.g. via dietpi-config network options. Many thanks to  @Ianszh for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5133\n DietPi-Software |   Mosquitto    Applied a workaround on ARMv6 where the latest Mosquitto packages from the official APT repository are not ARMv6-compatible.
