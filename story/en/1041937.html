Also it’s probably worth prefixing this post with two things. The first being the caveat that whether or not i ever fly with easyJet again is immaterial to their business, given that the model of budget airlines is one of opportunistic sales. Their loyalty programmes are minimal to non-existent  1 (although that may change in the near future  2) because the nature of their passengers is not one of loyalty. When you’re looking for a short haul cheap flight you’re unlikely to be attracted to schemes that only benefit you after years, or hundreds of thousands of air miles, worth of loyalty.</p><p>我在此博客文章中的工作标题是“为什么我再也不会再乘坐easyJet了”，但是那太可点击了。另外，为这篇文章加上两点可能是值得的。首先要告诫的是，考虑到廉价航空公司的模式是机会性销售之一，我是否再次乘坐easyJet对其业务而言并不重要。他们的忠诚度计划是最小的，甚至根本不存在1（尽管在不久的将来可能会改变2），因为乘客的本质不是忠诚度之一。当您想要短途廉价航班时，您不太可能会被吸引数年或数十万飞行里程的忠诚度的计划所吸引。</p><p> The reality of the budget airlines is they don’t have to worry about losing future passengers, thousands of them even, because there will always be enough replacement passengers. Budget airlines’ flights average above a 90% occupancy rate  3.</p><p> 廉价航空公司的现实是，他们不必担心失去未来的乘客，甚至成千上万的乘客，因为总会有足够的替代乘客。廉价航空公司的航班平均入住率超过90％3。</p><p> So the point of me never flying with easyJet again is not because i am under any illusion that it will be detrimental to their business, it won’t, but rather to protect  myself should the situation happen again. They’re not the first airline to make my “list”, but the others have reasons that aren’t interesting enough to require a blog post.</p><p> 因此，我再也不会与easyJet一起飞行的要点不是因为我有任何幻想都不会损害他们的生意，也不会，而是要在情况再次发生时保护自己。他们不是第一个成为我的“名单”的航空公司，但是其他人的理由却不足以要求撰写博客。</p><p> What i am hoping with this post is that it gives the reader enough information that, should they find themselves in a similar situation, they are more informed as to their options and the potential ramifications of the choice they make. This is going to affect more travelers when the UK leaves the EU.</p><p> 我希望这篇文章能为读者提供足够的信息，如果他们发现自己处于类似的情况，他们会更加了解自己的选择以及所做出选择的潜在后果。当英国离开欧盟时，这将影响更多的旅行者。</p><p> The second prefix is that easyJet recently posted their first year of losses  4, due to the current global situation. I started writing this post sometime in 2019, way before the pandemic royally fucked the airline industry. It’s arguable that the airline industry being royally fucked was only a matter of time, and the consequences of  that could mean the details here are now even more relevant - It may become even harder to claim refunds and compensation from them in the future. Airline companies will probably double down on their approach to handling compensation claims to avoid yet more financial loss.</p><p> 第二个前缀是easyJet由于当前的全球形势，最近公布了他们的第一年亏损4。我在2019年的某个时候开始写这篇文章，就在大流行使航空业陷入混乱之前。有争议的是，航空业被皇家搞砸只是时间问题，其后果可能意味着此处的细节现在变得更加相关-将来向他们要求退款和赔偿可能变得更加困难。航空公司可能会加倍处理赔偿要求，以避免更多的财务损失。</p><p>  On 23rd December 2018 my partner and I were due to fly from Geneva to Manchester on easyJet flight EZY1952, aircraft registration G-EZRU, which was scheduled to depart at 16:50 CET and arrive at 17:50 GMT. I had booked these flights a couple of months earlier, which combined with the date of our departure and return lead to a total cost of 619.38 CHF.</p><p>  2018年12月23日，我和我的搭档将以easyJet航班EZY1952从日内瓦飞往曼彻斯特，飞机登记号为G-EZRU，原定于欧洲中部时间16:50出发，于格林尼治标准时间17:50抵达。我已经在几个月前预订了这些航班，加上我们的出发和返程日期，总费用为619.38瑞士法郎。</p><p> The 600+ CHF didn’t include any of the optional extras, priority boarding, seat choice, checked bags, etc. It was the “basic” cost of the “cheap” flights. This cost is four to five times more than the normal cost of this route, as I said due to the relatively late booking (two months in advance) and the dates of the flights. This route is normally far cheaper:</p><p> 600瑞郎以上不包含任何额外选项，优先登机，座位选择，托运行李等。这是“廉价”航班的“基本”费用。正如我所说，由于预订时间相对较晚（提前两个月）和航班日期，所以此费用是这条航线正常费用的四到五倍。这条路线通常便宜得多： </p><p>  Anyway, given the alternatives and the limited options for our dates these were the flights we settled on and decide the cost was worth it to spend Xmas with the family. The flight was delayed by just a few minutes, which isn’t unusual for this route, but then took off as normal at 17:14:05 CET.</p><p>无论如何，考虑到我们约会的其他选择和有限的选择，这些都是我们定居的航班，并决定与家人一起度过圣诞节的费用是值得的。航班只延迟了几分钟，这在这条路线上并不罕见，但随后于欧洲中部时间17:14:05正常起飞。</p><p> A few moments after take off, the literal wheels no longer being on the ground part of it, I felt my ears pop quite suddenly. That might not be taken as unusual either, but I live at altitude and my ears don’t normally pop on flights. The plane then spent several minutes in low cloud, another unusual thing given the cloud line is normally cut through quicker. I turned to my partner and suggested that something was off.</p><p> 起飞后片刻，字面上的轮子不再位于地面上，我感到我的耳朵突然突然弹出。也许这也不算不寻常，但我生活在高海拔地区，在飞行中我的耳朵通常不会弹出。然后飞机在低云中呆了几分钟，考虑到云线通常会更快切穿，这是另一种不寻常的事情。我转向我的伴侣，并建议出事了。</p><p> A couple of minutes later the pilot informed us that the flight would be returning to Geneva airport as the cabin pressure system, and its backup, had failed. Given the potentially catastrophic consequences of the cabin pressure system failing at cruising altitude, I considered that everyone on the plane had been very lucky.</p><p> 几分钟后，飞行员告知我们，由于机舱压力系统及其后备飞机故障，该航班将返回日内瓦机场。考虑到机舱压力系统在巡航高度上失效可能带来的灾难性后果，我认为飞机上的每个人都很幸运。</p><p> The plane landed safely at Geneva airport at 17:41:00 CET, meaning a total flight time of about 25 minutes  5. I contacted my parents to let them know we wouldn’t be arriving as planned and would keep them informed as to any updates:</p><p> 飞机在欧洲中部时间17:41:00安全降落在日内瓦机场，这意味着总共飞行时间约为25分钟5。我与父母取得联系，告知他们我们不会按计划到达，并将让他们了解任何情况。更新：</p><p>  We remained on the plane, after the pilot informed us that the technical crew were going to look into the issue. We were then told the parts would be replaced/fixed and this would take three to four hours. At this point I knew that we would not be flying until the next day as a) it was now 19:00 and Geneva airport has strict limitations on flights after 22:00, and b) it would be massively irresponsible of the airline to let this plane fly without a more comprehensive test that would probably take longer than the three to four hour estimate  6.</p><p>  在飞行员告知我们技术人员将要调查的问题之后，我们仍在飞机上。然后我们被告知零件将被更换/固定，这将需要三到四个小时。在这一点上，我知道我们要等到第二天才能开始飞行，因为a）现在是19:00，日内瓦机场对22:00之后的航班有严格的限制，并且b）航空公司完全不负责任这架飞机没有进行更全面的测试，可能要花费三到四个小时的估计时间6。</p><p> Since it was going to take a few hours all passengers disembarked and returned to the departure gate. I’m not sure how long we were on the plane, while it was on the ground, but looking at the evidence I kept afterwards it appears that we were on it for approximately one hour fifteen minutes. This is from the time it landed to receiving a text message from easyJet apologising for the delay:</p><p> 由于要花几个小时，所以所有乘客都下了飞机，然后返回了登机口。我不确定飞机在地上时我们在飞机上待了多长时间，但是查看之后我保留的证据，看来我们在飞机上待了大约一小时十五分钟。这是从它着陆到从easyJet收到一条短信致歉而造成的延迟的时间：</p><p>  As soon as we got back into the gate I sat down and checked to see if there were any other flights available. Sure enough there was: we could get a one way easyJet flight to Liverpool, so I booked two seats for a total of 189.26 CHF. This flight would depart at 21:25 CET and arrive at 22:20 GMT, four hours and thirty minutes after our original arrival time.</p><p>  当我们回到登机口后，我坐下来检查是否还有其他航班可用。确实可以肯定的是：我们可以乘单程easyJet飞机飞往利物浦，所以我预订了两个座位，总计189.26 CHF。该航班将在欧洲中部时间21:25起飞，并在格林尼治标准时间22:20抵达，比我们原来的抵达时间晚了四个小时三十分钟。 </p><p> It should be said at this point I was reasonably confident of a few things:</p><p>在这一点上应该说，我对以下几件事相当有信心：</p><p> We would have all the inconvenience of that, and lose one third of our time in the UK</p><p> 不便之处，我们将失去在英国的三分之一时间</p><p>  Given the original arrival time was delayed by more than three hours we were covered by EU Regulation 261/2004</p><p>  鉴于原定到达时间被延迟了三个多小时，我们受到欧盟261/2004法规的保护</p><p>  So the airline would have to compensate €250 for each of us, which would at least cover the alternate flights I had booked</p><p>  因此，航空公司必须为我们每个人赔偿250欧元，这将至少涵盖我预订的替代航班</p><p>   Our flight to Liverpool went without issue, and we weren’t the only people to have rebooked from the delayed flight as we overheard some other passengers explaining their situation to the cabin crew  7.</p><p>   我们飞往利物浦的航班没有问题，我们并不是唯一一个从延迟航班中重新预订的人，因为我们听到了其他一些乘客向乘务员解释情况的消息。</p><p>  The next day I used easyJet’s contact form to submit a claim under EC261/2004 regulations. I knew this was going to take a long time so figured I may as well start the process as soon as possible. My claim was made on the basis that the original flight had been delayed overnight and I had booked alternate travel arrangements to get to my destination.</p><p>  第二天，我使用easyJet的联系表根据EC261 / 2004法规提交了索赔。我知道这将花费很长时间，所以我想我应该尽快开始该过程。我之所以提出索赔，是因为原来的航班已被推迟一夜，并且我已经预订了前往我目的地的替代旅行安排。</p><p> I considered the cost of the original flights a sunk cost. I wasn’t actually interested in compensation and I just wanted the cost of the alternate flights refunded, which came in at less than half the amount of compensation EC261/2004 would give considering the length of the delay to the original flight.</p><p> 我认为原始航班的费用是沉没费用。我实际上对补偿并不感兴趣，我只是想退回备用航班的费用，而这笔费用还不到EC261 / 2004补偿的一半，因为考虑到原航班的延误时间，EC261 / 2004可以提供此补偿。 </p><p> The response from easyJet came back quickly, the next day:  As you were a no show on the flight we would not be able t reimburse the costs for alternate transport. - well that didn’t read like a response by someone/thing that had actually looked into the details. We had shown up for the flight, given we were on it when the pressure systems failed, and clearly we wouldn’t show up for the  rescheduled flight if we arranged alternate transport as we can’t be in two places at once.</p><p>第二天，easyJet的回应很快就回来了：由于您没有登机，我们无法报销替代运输的费用。 -听起来不像是真正调查了细节的某人/某事的回应。鉴于压力系统出现故障时我们就在飞机上，所以我们已经出现在飞机上，并且显然，如果我们安排了替代运输，因为我们不能一次在两个地方，就不会出现在改期航班上。</p><p> I assumed this was just a first level response of “refuse all claims, through a semantic dispute, because this will cause a not insignificant number of people to give up”  8. The contact form doesn’t have a place to describe the reason for the claim in detail so I needed to call easyJet to explain.</p><p> 我以为这只是“通过语义争议拒绝所有主张，因为这将导致相当数量的人放弃”的第一层回应。8.联系表格没有地方描述有关索赔的详细信息，因此我需要致电easyJet进行解释。</p><p>  I’ll spare you too much detail, as you can search for it if you want to (or read a summary on  Wikipedia). Essentially - EU 261/2004 allows compensation if your flight is from or to an EU/EAA area and is either delayed or cancelled [less than one week before the flight date]. The level of compensation depends on the distance of the flight.</p><p>  我将为您省去太多细节，因为您可以根据需要进行搜索（或阅读Wikipedia上的摘要）。从本质上讲，如果您的航班是往返于EU / EAA地区，并且航班延误或取消（航班日期前不到一周），EU 261/2004允许赔偿。补偿水平取决于飞行距离。</p><p> In this particular case the delay was more than four hours, and the flight was less than 1,500km, so would qualify for €250 compensation (per passenger).</p><p> 在这种特殊情况下，延误超过四个小时，且航班飞行时间不到1500公里，因此有资格获得250欧元的赔偿（每位乘客）。</p><p> The regulation also says the passengers must be given assistance, and in this particular case of the flight being delayed overnight would mean hotel accommodation and transport between the airport and the hotel. This was Geneva two days from Xmas, so that would probably mean another €250.</p><p> 该法规还规定，必须向乘客提供帮助，在这种特殊情况下，航班会在一夜之间延迟，这将意味着旅馆在机场和旅馆之间的住宿和交通。这是圣诞节从日内瓦出发的两天，因此可能还需要250欧元。</p><p> So a reasonable estimate is easyJet would be paying in the region of €750 per passenger on this delayed flight. Given it was full (at least to my recollection) easyJet were looking at a bill of at least €100,000 for compensation + accommodation expenses  9.</p><p> 因此，一个合理的估计是，easyJet会为此延误航班向每位乘客支付750欧元左右。鉴于已经满了（至少在我的记忆中），easyJet正在寻找至少100,000欧元的账单，用于赔偿+住宿费用9。</p><p> To go off on a tangent slightly - all of this is going to be up in the air when the UK leaves the EU. Of course that depends what the UK government  decide to do about it. Given everything else on their plate don’t be surprised if this one gets forgotten about until the claims start to appear.</p><p> 稍微切线-当英国离开欧盟时，所有这些都将悬而未决。当然，这取决于英国政府决定采取何种措施。鉴于其他一切，如果在声明开始出现之前忘记这一点，请不要感到惊讶。 </p><p>  As my claim, via easyJet’s web form, was rejected relatively quickly I decided to pick up the phone and see if speaking to someone would make a difference. I explained the situation and they agreed to pass this on to someone who would look at it in more detail, given the time of year this would take a few days at the least.</p><p>正如我通过easyJet的网络表格所声称的那样，相对较快地拒绝了我的决定，所以我决定拿起电话，看看与某人说话是否会有所作为。我解释了这种情况，他们同意将其转交给可以更详细研究它的人，因为一年中的时间至少需要几天。</p><p> A couple of weeks later I received an email stating “Unfortunately as you were a no show on the transferred flight there is no reimbursement for EUC216 Compensation”. But also “As a goodwill gesture I have created a flight voucher to the value of the 51.90 GBP”.</p><p> 几周后，我收到一封电子邮件，指出“很遗憾，因为您在转机航班上没有出战，因此无法补偿EUC216补偿金”。还有“作为一种善意的姿态，我创建了一张价值51.90英镑的飞行凭证”。</p><p> Slightly odd - no reimbursement but here’s a goodwill gesture? Sounds like a second line of defense - offer a voucher lower than the cost of compensation in the hope it will be taken. I figured at this point I wasn’t going to make any more progress with easyJet myself.</p><p> 有点奇怪-没有报销，但这是一种善意的姿态？听起来像是第二道防线-提供比补偿成本低的代金券，以期能够兑现。我认为到这一点，我自己并不会在easyJet方面取得更多进步。</p><p> The interesting thing (from my “works in software development point of view”) was the reference numbers included in the email subject lines from easyJet - it appears these are unique to each email sent from them, so we can figure out the number of emails sent:</p><p> 有趣的是（从我的“软件开发工作角度”）是easyJet电子邮件主题行中包含的参考号-看来这些参考号对于从其发送的每封电子邮件都是唯一的，因此我们可以计算出电子邮件的数量发送：</p><p>  None of these pass the Luhn check  10 so we can assume they are integers incrementing by 1 each time. So we can infer from the above that easyJet received approximately a quarter of a million customer service requests in the 2.5 week period I was trying to get my own resolved. That’s roughly one every five seconds  11.</p><p>  这些都没有通过Luhn校验10，因此我们可以假设它们是每次递增1的整数。因此，我们可以从上面推论得出，easyJet在我试图解决自己的2.5周时间内收到了大约一百万分之一的客户服务请求。大约每五秒钟一次11。</p><p>  The next step was to throw one of those “no win no fee” services at the problem. I had to submit various documents, hand over power of attorney, answer quite a lot of questions, and the process took almost 12 months. In the end they had to get the Alternative Dispute Resolution for Aviation (ADR) involved, which required more questions and forms to be filled in.</p><p>  下一步就是解决其中一个“不赢不收费”的服务。我不得不提交各种文件，交出委托书，回答很多问题，整个过程耗时近12个月。最后，他们必须获得航空替代争议解决方案（ADR）的参与，这需要填写更多的问题和表格。</p><p>  The ADR conclusion was that “the Passenger’s claim has not been upheld and there is no remedy or award required by the Airline”. But also that the “determination is not binding on the passenger who therefore still has the option to pursue the complaint via the courts”. This was all based on the definition, and legal precedence, of “cancellation”.</p><p>  ADR得出的结论是：“旅客的主张没有得到支持，航空公司没有要求采取任何补救或赔偿措施”。还要指出的是，“确定对旅客没有约束力，因此旅客仍然可以选择通过法院提起诉讼”。这些都是基于“取消”的定义和法律优先权。 </p><p> Essentially a “tough luck maybe try harder” response. However, the devil  is in the details and the ADR response contained a revealing error - in detailing the claim the ADR response included the rescheduled flight number,  but it was the wrong one: EZY9268. Another easyJet flight that had been delayed long enough that a new flight number was required.</p><p>本质上是“艰难的运气，也许会加倍努力”。但是，细节决定成败，ADR响应中包含一个明显的错误-在详细说明ADR响应中包含重新安排的航班号之后，却是错误的：EZY9268。另一架easyJet航班已经延误了很长时间，因此需要一个新的航班号。</p><p> What was the reason for the wrong flight number? A copy paste error while dealing with my claim? Probably unlikely. A typo? What? Accidentally fat-fingering the code and still managing to input one that had the same pattern from four months previous? No chance.</p><p> 航班号错误的原因是什么？处理我的索赔时出现复制粘贴错误？大概不太可能。错字了吗什么？意外地对代码进行繁琐的操作，仍然设法输入与四个月前具有相同模式的代码？没有机会。</p><p> Most likely is one of two things: 1) the ADR has a stock response/responses for all the different claim types and they just fill in the details, or 2) the ADR took the response to a similar claim from before and replaced the old details with my details, failing to replace all of them.</p><p> 最有可能是以下两种情况之一：1）ADR对所有不同的索赔类型都有库存响应/响应，并且只填写详细信息，或者2）ADR对以前的类似索赔采用了响应并替换了旧的详细信息和我的详细信息一样，无法全部替换。</p><p> This is the same as when I contacted easyJet support the first time, no time spent looking into the actual details of the claim and just dismissing it on semantics. Lazy work by the ADR.</p><p> 这与我第一次联系easyJet支持人员时是一样的，没有花时间去研究声明的实际细节，而只是根据语义来消除它。 ADR的懒惰工作。</p><p>  I still believe there is a case here, and through the entire process the refusal of easyJet to honour my claim came down to semantics. They continued to argue that we were a no show on  the flight, when in reality we were a no show on the  rescheduled flight - that rescheduling being a delay of more than 16hours.</p><p>  我仍然相信这里有一个案例，在整个过程中，easyJet拒绝兑现我的主张可以归结为语义。他们继续争辩说，我们在航班上没有上场表演，而实际上我们在重新安排的航班上没有参加表演-重新安排是超过16小时的延误。</p><p> My mistake, in my argument for compensation, was to say that the original flight had be  cancelled and replaced with another the next day because the  rescheduled flight had been given a different flight number. It seems logical that if a flight has a different flight number then it is not the same flight, ergo the original flight was cancelled and replaced with another. In the txt messages from easyJet they even refer to the rescheduled flight as “your  new flight”.</p><p> 在我要求赔偿的论点中，我的错误是说，原来的航班已被取消，并在第二天替换为另一个航班，因为重新安排的航班已获得了不同的航班号。似乎合乎逻辑的是，如果一个航班的航班号不同，那么它就不是同一航班，因此，原来的航班被取消，并换成另一个。在easyJet的txt消息中，他们甚至将重新安排的航班称为“您的新航班”。</p><p> The ADR’s decision clarifies this by saying a change in flight number does not imply a cancellation, and they cite previous case precedence. My opinion on this is that is nonsense, and a get out clause for airlines who can use it as a semantic dispute. A flight could hypothetically be “delayed” by days or weeks and then take place under a different flight number, if this allows the airlines to say that the flight wasn’t actually cancelled and therefore reduce their compensation costs for those who make alternate travel arrangements in the meantime.</p><p> ADR的决定通过说航班号的变更并不意味着取消航班来澄清这一点，他们援引了以前的案件优先权。我对此是无稽之谈，这是航空公司可以将其用作语义争议的逃避条款。假设某个航班可能“延迟”几天或几周，然后在不同的航班号下进行，如果这允许航空公司说该航班实际上并未取消，从而减少了他们为其他旅行安排者的补偿费用同时。 </p><p> It seems this is a loophole in EU Regulation 261/2004, and the legislation needs an amendment to clarify the response to situations like this. I can understand that this could be misused by those who decide not to show up for a flight and then don’t actually travel, but if proof of alternate transport can be provided then that would cover it.</p><p>似乎这是欧盟第261/2004号法规的漏洞，该法规需要修订以阐明对此类情况的应对措施。我可以理解，那些决定不参加航班然后实际上不去旅行的人可能会误用它，但是如果可以提供替代运输的证明，那将可以解决。</p><p> I have resubmit my claim, using a different service and using alternative semantics. I shall update this post when the outcome of that claim is known…</p><p> 我已使用其他服务并使用其他语义重新提交了声明。当该索赔的结果已知时，我将更新此职位。</p><p>  About one month after the response from the ADR I sent another claim for compensation, using an alternative “no win no fee” service. This was one offered by a consumer law firm in the United Kingdom. Again, documents were required, some forms filled in, and some minor back-and-forth took place.</p><p>  在ADR回应后大约一个月，我使用另一种“不赢不收费”服务再次提出了赔偿要求。这是由英国的一家消费者律师事务所提供的。同样，需要文件，填写一些表格，并进行一些次要的往返。</p><p> Eight months after I submit  this claim easyJet finally agreed to pay compensation, which was almost two years after the original flight. This process still involved some dragging of feet - easyJet wanted proof of my bookings, then a formal letter was sent giving them 28 days to respond. Then they went quiet.</p><p> 在我提出此要求的八个月后，easyJet最终同意支付赔偿，这距最初的航班已经快两年了。这个过程仍然涉及一些拖延脚步-easyJet希望提供我的预订证明，然后发送了一封正式信件，给了他们28天的回复时间。然后他们安静了。</p><p> The service I was using explained this, and I’m repeating it here verbatim:</p><p> 我使用的服务对此进行了解释，我在这里逐字重复：</p><p> As you will no doubt appreciate, the airline has so far refused to pay your compensation and as such it seems that court proceedings are necessary in order to enforce your rights.</p><p> 毫无疑问，您很高兴，该航空公司迄今拒绝支付您的赔偿，因此，似乎有必要通过法院程序来行使您的权利。</p><p> Unfortunately airlines still regularly make it difficult for passengers to claim the compensation that they’re rightly entitled to. We have historically issued court proceedings for over 100,000 clients and we’re pleased to say that the (vast majority) of these cases have been successful.</p><p> 不幸的是，航空公司仍然经常使乘客很难要求他们应有的赔偿。历史上，我们已经为超过100,000个客户发布了诉讼程序，我们很高兴地说，这些案例（绝大多数）都已经成功。 </p><p> We’ve seen that the court process can clearly be an extremely effective method of compelling airlines to pay compensation that is due, however that is regrettably not currently the case, for reasons that we will explain.</p><p>我们已经看到，法院程序显然是强迫航空公司支付应得赔偿的极其有效的方法，但是遗憾的是，目前情况并非如此，我们将对此进行解释。</p><p> As a result of airlines rejecting so many claims the courts are currently dealing with so many claims for flight delay compensation that they do not have the capacity or resource to deal with any new claims.</p><p> 由于航空公司拒绝了如此多的要求，因此法院目前正在处理如此多的航班延误赔偿要求，以至于他们没有能力或资源来处理任何新的要求。</p><p> This ludicrous situation means that we currently act for thousands of clients who, like you, may have perfectly valid claims for compensation, however they cannot enforce their rights because of the buckling court system.</p><p> 这种可笑的情况意味着我们目前为成千上万的客户提供服务，这些客户和您一样，可能拥有完全有效的赔偿要求，但是由于法院体制屈曲，他们无法行使自己的权利。</p><p> This situation is clearly unsustainable and we are working tireless with the courts to try and secure additional judicial resource so that claims like yours can be heard without further delay.</p><p> 这种情况显然是不可持续的，我们正在不懈地与法院合作，努力确保获得更多的司法资源，以便像您这样的要求得到及时的聆讯。</p><p> Court proceedings issued for over 100,000 clients by this service alone? That’s absurd, almost offensively so. It seems in this particular war of attrition the airlines are losing badly. The lawyers have beaten them in the automation game.</p><p> 仅此服务就为100,000多个客户发布了法院诉讼程序？这是荒谬的，几乎是令人反感的。在这场特殊的消耗战中，航空公司似乎损失惨重。律师们在自动化游戏中击败了他们。</p><p> Although the second company successfully managed to get compensation out of easyJet there was a weird feeling throughout the process that I wasn’t ever dealing with a human on the other end of the emails being sent back and forth. The point is that a lot of this  can be automated, and it seems the ones that do that successfully are raking in a large part of the pot - 50% of the final compensation in our case.</p><p> 尽管第二家公司成功地从easyJet那里获得了赔偿，但是在整个过程中，我感到奇怪的是，我从来没有在来回发送电子邮件的另一端与人打交道。关键是很多可以自动化，而且成功完成的似乎占了很大一部分，在本案中为最终补偿的50％。</p><p> Automated claims systems, why don’t airlines have these? They would save money on support staff/legal fees/etc. The could charge a couple of pounds/dollars/euros more per ticket and probably cover all compensation costs. We know that “no win no fee” claims services exist. They know they exist. They know that we know that they exist, so what the fuck are we all doing wasting our time here?</p><p> 自动理赔系统，为什么航空公司没有这些？他们将节省支持人员/律师费/等方面的费用。这样可能会给每张票多收取几英镑/美元/欧元的费用，并可能支付所有赔偿费用。我们知道存在“不赢不赔”的理赔服务。他们知道他们存在。他们知道我们知道他们存在，所以我们该死在浪费时间吗？ </p><p> The final twist in this tale was when we flew back to Switzerland a few days later. We sat in Manchester airport waiting to board the easyJet plane, and we could see the registration number: G-EZRU. The exact same plane that had flown out of Geneva, had both its pressure systems fail, had been known to have other problems in its service history  7.</p><p>这个故事的最后转折是几天后我们飞往瑞士。我们坐在曼彻斯特机场等待登上easyJet飞机，我们可以看到注册号：G-EZRU。众所周知，这架飞机从日内瓦起飞时所使用的飞机完全相同，但两个压力系统均发生故障，因此在其服役历史中还存在其他问题7。</p><p> Would you get on that plane? The potential to say something that would cause disruption in the boarding gate was high. Of course we didn’t. As I said: we had already considered the original flight a sunk cost.</p><p> 你会坐那架飞机吗？说出可能会导致登机口中断的事情的可能性很高。当然没有正如我所说：我们已经考虑过原始航班的沉没成本。</p><p>  If you’re wondering how I have the details it’s because I pulled them off of  Flight Radar 24 the next day. You can see the flight data  here and a screenshot of the flight path  here. Comparing these to the usual data and flight paths is an exercise left to the reader.  ↩</p><p>  如果您想知道我的详细信息，是因为我第二天就将其从Flight Radar 24上拉了下来。您可以在此处查看航班数据，并在此处查看航班路径的屏幕截图。将这些与常规数据和飞行路线进行比较是读者的一项练习。 ↩</p><p>  I’m hand waving here, knowing nothing of the actual technicalities, but to rush to get a plane out to meet a deadline after a critical system  and its backup have just been replaced/repaired? Not going to happen.  ↩</p><p>  我在这里挥手致意，对实际技术一无所知，但是在关键系统及其备用系统刚刚更换/维修后，急着赶飞机赶在最后期限前完成任务吗？不会发生。 ↩</p><p>  One of the things we overheard was a response of “I know exactly which plane you mean, it’s been nothing but trouble since it arrived last year” …  ↩  ↩ 2</p><p>  我们听到的其中一件事是“我确切地知道您的意思，这架飞机自去年问世以来就没什么问题了”……↩2 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://leejo.github.io/2020/12/26/EZY1952/">https://leejo.github.io/2020/12/26/EZY1952/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/律师/">#律师</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/automate/">#automate</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/航班/">#航班</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
