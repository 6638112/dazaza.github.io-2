Few \u2014 very few, in fact \u2014 come out willing or even able to express complex ideas in ways appealing to non-academics. John Gray is one of those rare intellectuals.   \rProfessors tend to scoff at books written for more general audiences. Anything that becomes popular is taken as potentially not serious. But the truth is, most professors simply cannot write, talk, and perhaps even think in a manner which can engage non-academics. Having gone through years of rigorous, specialized training, scholars find it hard to communicate their insights to anyone outside their narrow fields. Gray does not.  Feline Philosophy: Cats and the Meaning of Life is broadly appealing. Even more impressive, it has readers seriously consider radical ideas.   \rIt is difficult to speak about the myth of human progress, the navel-gazing silliness of autonomy and reason, the pompous attitude of the righteous, and the associated paradoxical nature of morality, accepting that neither love nor death are really such a big deal and \u2014 this is the real point of the book \u2014 the meaninglessness of the meaning of life. Gray does so without strong arguments, logical deductions, or other conventional philosophical tools. Big-name philosophers are referenced, but mostly on the back of novels about cats. Intertwining stories and facts about cats with philosophy, Gray invites serious reflection without telling readers how to reason or what to think.   \rThe 111-page book is broken into six chapters. In the first one, \u201cCats and Philosophy,\u201d Gray plainly states: \u201cThe nature of cats, and what we can learn from it, is the subject of this book.\u201d Here, and in the second chapter, \u201cWhy Cats Do Not Struggle to Be Happy,\u201d Gray presents philosophy as an effect of restlessness: it is born as an attempt to calm the anxiety of living in a chaotic and unpredictable world. Happiness then becomes a project for the future, when we do not feel un-at-ease. Unfortunately, striving with a clear plan in mind only makes things worse. \u201cOur lives are shaped by chance and our emotions by the body. Much of human life \u2014 and much of philosophy \u2014 is an attempt to divert ourselves from this fact.\u201d For cats, on the other hand, happiness just might be their natural condition.   \rIn the next chapter, Gray revisits one of his more unique positions. Discussing \u201cFeline Ethics,\u201d Gray reminds readers that moral values, standards, and any way of thinking about what is good or bad, are historically and regionally relative and contingent. This is true not just of cultures or societies, but of individuals as well. \u201cWhen people talk of morality they do not know what it is they are talking about. At the same time they are unshakably certain in what they say. This may seem paradoxical. But it is not, since what they are doing is expressing their emotions.\u201d Borrowing heavily from Spinoza, Daoism ( Daodejing/Tao Te Ching), and Zen Buddhism, Gray eloquently dances through attacks on morality, rationalism, agency, and the self.   \rChapter four provides a soothing respite from serious philosophical discussions. Here, \u201cHuman vs Feline Love\u201d is discussed largely by way of summarizing novels about cats. It is difficult to say exactly what, if any, specific point Gray is trying to make. And this is not meant as a criticism. Like many great thinkers, Gray is simply inviting readers to reflect and consider certain perspectives. Chapter five, on \u201cTime, Death and the Feline Soul,\u201d is written in a similar manner. The overarching idea here is simply that cats seem to \u201caccept life as a gift,\u201d while humans anxiously toil over every aspect of life and often get caught up in endless speculation about death.   \rIn the final chapter, \u201cCats and the Meaning of Life,\u201d Gray challenges that \u201cthe good life for each of us is not chosen but found.\u201d We are asked to consider the Daoist idea that \u201cwe must follow the way within us.\u201d Should we do that, our lives will be \u201cricher than any idea of perfection.\u201d He continues: \u201cThe good life is not a life you might have led or may yet lead, but the life you already have. Here, cats can be our teachers, for they do not miss the lives they have not lived.\u201d   \rGray eventually gives us \u201cTen Feline Hints on How to Live Well.\u201d They are concise and eloquent lessons we might learn from thinking about a \u201cfeline philosophy,\u201d or even from an honest reflection on life. The last sentence well summarizes the book in both content and style: \u201cThe meaning of life is a touch, a scent, which comes by chance and is gone before you know it.\u201d   \rReaders might be surprised that in the 10 lessons we never hear about \u201cplay.\u201d Upon further intellectual consideration, this becomes even more puzzling. The English intellectual is extremely fond of Daoism and Zen Buddhism; he titled his book  Straw Dogs (2002) after the fifth chapter of the  Daodejing. But the second cardinal Daoist text, and the major facilitator of the philosophical interchange between Daoism and Buddhism that produced Zen, the  Zhuangzi ( Chuang-Tzu), is conspicuously absent in  Feline Philosophy. This Daoist classic is not only full of jokes, conversations between animals, and advice from trees \u2014 it introduces \u201cplay\u201d as a philosophical approach and advocates it as a possible approach to life. Readers may seriously wonder why Gray did not talk about play in  Feline Philosophy, and what he thinks of the  Zhuangzi.   \rRelatedly, one great feline novel not mentioned in Gray\u2019s book is  I Am a Cat\u00a0by S\u014dseki Natsume (1867\u20131916). Natsume\u2019s story is playfully written from a cat\u2019s perspective. In more than a few places, the cat, or people around it, dives into prolonged digs against Western theories of progress, reason, and positivism \u2014 an obvious overlap with Gray\u2019s own predilections. More important than the philosophical digressions, however, is the playful element of  I Am a Cat. Unsurprisingly, much of  I Am a Cat, and Natsume\u2019s work in general, draws heavily on the  Zhuangzi.   \rSome reviewers of  Feline Philosophy: Cats and the Meaning of Life have summarized John Gray as advocating a coupling of feline indifference with Daoist contemplation. This assessment is more of a review of reviews than of the book itself. The real joy of  Feline Philosophy comes from the very experience of reading it. The book does not attempt to \u201cprove\u201d anything. Gray has survived the wringer and now expertly plays with his philosophical reflections. Like the  Daodejing, the Daoist classic Gray constantly references, readers miss the point if they search  Feline Philosophy for evaluative judgments, truths, or even arguments. The  Daodejing is (most likely) a record of sayings written, rewritten, edited, and reedited for centuries. For over two millennia, everyone from rulers, scholars, and Daoist priests to farmers and hermits read the text in a similar manner. They repeated the short sayings and reflected on their lives. What was useful from the  Daodejing they used, what wasn\u2019t they ignored. And that was that.   \rPerhaps we can, or even should, do something similar with our philosophical discussions today. Gray undoubtedly has his own philosophical perspective. But he has certainly learned from cats, and his reflections are honest and humble. In a world where hubris of all kinds fuels objectively difficult situations, it might not be a bad idea to be a little less black and white. Indeed, it might be even better if we added a bit of playfulness.       Paul J. D\u2019Ambrosio is associate professor of Chinese philosophy at East China Normal University in Shanghai, China.

", "note_en": "When the coronavirus shut down New York last spring, many residents came to rely on a colossal building they had never heard of: JFK8, Amazon\u2019s only fulfillment center in America\u2019s largest city.\n What happened inside shows how Jeff Bezos created the workplace of the future and pulled off the impossible during the pandemic \u2014 but also reveals what\u2019s standing in the way of his promise to do better by his employees.\n Each year, hundreds of thousands of workers churn through a vast mechanism that hires and monitors, disciplines and fires. Amid the pandemic, the already strained system lurched.\n   Last September, Ann Castillo saw an email from Amazon that made no sense. Her husband had worked for the company for five years, most recently at the supersize warehouse on Staten Island that served as the retailer\u2019s critical pipeline to New York City. Now it wanted him back on the night shift.\n \u201cWe notified your manager and H.R. about your return to work on Oct. 1, 2020,\u201d the message said.\n Ms. Castillo was incredulous. While working mandatory overtime in the spring, her 42-year-old husband, Alberto, had been among the first wave of employees at the site to test positive for the coronavirus. Ravaged by fevers and infections, he suffered extensive brain damage. On tests of responsiveness, Ms. Castillo said, \u201chis score was almost nothing.\u201d\n  For months, Ms. Castillo, a polite, get-it-done physical therapist, had been alerting the company that her husband, who had been proud to work for the retail giant, was severely ill. The responses were disjointed and confusing. Emails and calls to Amazon\u2019s automated systems often dead-ended. The company\u2019s benefits were generous, but she had been left panicking as disability payments mysteriously halted. She managed to speak to several human resources workers, one of whom reinstated the payments, but after that, the dialogue mostly reverted to phone trees, auto-replies and voice mail messages on her husband\u2019s phone asking if he was coming back.\n The return-to-work summons deepened her suspicion that Amazon didn\u2019t fully register his situation. \u201cHaven\u2019t they kept track of what happened to him?\u201d she said. She wanted to ask the company: \u201cAre your workers disposable? Can you just replace them?\u201d\n Mr. Castillo\u2019s workplace, the only Amazon fulfillment center in America\u2019s largest city, was achieving the impossible during the pandemic. With New York\u2019s classic industries suffering mass collapse, the warehouse, called JFK8, absorbed hotel workers, actors, bartenders and dancers, paying nearly $18 an hour. Driven by a new sense of mission to serve customers afraid to shop in person, JFK8 helped Amazon smash shipping records, reach stratospheric sales and book the equivalent of the previous three years\u2019 profits rolled into one.\n That success, speed and agility were possible because Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, had pioneered new ways of mass-managing people through technology, relying on a maze of systems that minimized human contact to grow unconstrained.\n But the company was faltering in ways outsiders could not see, according to a New York Times examination of JFK8 over the last year.\n In contrast to its precise, sophisticated processing of packages, Amazon\u2019s model for managing people \u2014 heavily reliant on metrics, apps and chatbots \u2014 was uneven and strained even before the coronavirus arrived, with employees often having to act as their own caseworkers, interviews and records show. Amid the pandemic, Amazon\u2019s system burned through workers, resulted in inadvertent firings and stalled benefits, and impeded communication, casting a shadow over a business success story for the ages.\n Amazon took steps unprecedented at the company to offer leniency, but then at times contradicted or ended them. Workers like Mr. Castillo at JFK8 were told to take as much unpaid time off as they needed, then hit with mandatory overtime. When Amazon offered employees flexible personal leaves, the system handling them jammed, issuing a blizzard of job-abandonment notices to workers and sending staff scrambling to save them, according to human resources and warehouse employees.\n  After absences initially soared and disrupted shipping, Amazon left employees mostly in the dark about the toll of the virus. The company did not tell workers at JFK8 or other warehouses the number of cases, causing them to worry whether notifications about \u201cindividuals\u201d testing positive meant two or 22. While Amazon said publicly that it was disclosing confirmed cases to health officials, New York City records show no reported cases until November. The company and city officials dispute what happened.\n Amazon continued to track every minute of most warehouse workers\u2019 shifts, from how fast they packed merchandise to how long they paused \u2014 the kind of monitoring that  spurred a failed unionization drive led by frustrated Black employees at an Alabama warehouse this spring. If productivity flagged, Amazon\u2019s computers assumed the worker was to blame. Early in the pandemic, the online retailer paused its firing of employees for low output, but that change was not announced clearly at JFK8, so some workers still feared that moving too slowly would cost them their livelihoods.\n \u201cIt is very important that area managers understand that associates are more than just numbers,\u201d an employee wrote on JFK8\u2019s internal feedback board last fall, adding: \u201cWe are human beings. We are not tools used to make their daily/weekly goals and rates.\u201d\n The company touted breathtaking job-creation numbers: From July to October 2020 alone, it scooped up 350,000 new workers, more than the population of St. Louis. Many recruits \u2014 hired through a computer screening, with little conversation or vetting \u2014 lasted just days or weeks.\n Even before the pandemic, previously unreported data shows, Amazon lost about 3 percent of its hourly associates each week, meaning the turnover among its work force was roughly 150 percent a year. That rate,  almost double that of the retail and logistics industries, has made some executives worry about running out of workers across America.\n In documenting the untold story of how the pandemic exposed the power and peril of Amazon\u2019s employment system, reporters interviewed nearly 200 current and former employees, from new hires at the JFK8 bus stop to back-office workers overseas to managers on Staten Island and in Seattle. The Times also reviewed company documents, legal filings and government records, as well as posts from warehouse feedback boards that served as a real-time ticker of worker concerns.\n  This April, Mr. Bezos said he was proud of the company\u2019s work culture, the \u201cachievable\u201d productivity goals, the pay and benefits. In interviews, the head of human resources for warehouses and the general manager of JFK8 said that the company prioritized employee welfare, noted that it had expanded its H.R. staff and cited internal surveys showing high worker satisfaction. Some managers from JFK8 and beyond described building deep relationships with their teams.\n Amazon acknowledged some issues with inadvertent firings, loss of benefits, job abandonment notices and leaves, but declined to disclose how many people were affected. Kelly Nantel, a spokeswoman, suggested that those problems and some others chronicled in this article were outliers.\n Ofori Agboka, the H.R. leader, noted that social distancing and masking had made it harder to engage employees in personal ways during the pandemic. Still, he said, \u201c98 percent of everything\u2019s going great \u2014 people are having the right experiences,\u201d getting the help they need when they want it.\n But several former executives who helped design Amazon\u2019s systems, and still call themselves admirers of the company, said the high turnover, pressure over productivity and consequences of scaling up have become too critical to ignore. The company has not ambitiously addressed those issues, said Paul Stroup, who until recently led corporate teams devoted to understanding warehouse workers.\n \u201cAmazon can solve pretty much any problem it puts its mind behind,\u201d he said in an interview. The human resources division, though, had nowhere near the focus, rigor and investment of Amazon\u2019s logistical operations, where he had previously worked. \u201cIt felt like I was in a different company,\u201d he said.\n David Niekerk, a former Amazon vice president who built the warehouse human resources operations, said that some problems stemmed from ideas the company had developed when it was much smaller. Mr. Bezos did not want an entrenched work force, calling it \u201ca march to mediocrity,\u201d Mr. Niekerk recalled, and saw low-skilled jobs as relatively short-term. As Amazon rapidly grew, Mr. Niekerk said, its policies were harder to implement with fairness and care. \u201cIt is just a numbers game in many ways,\u201d he said. \u201cThe culture gets lost.\u201d\n  Even Mr. Bezos, in his final lap as chief executive of the company he created, is now making startling concessions about the system he invented. In a recent letter to shareholders, he said the union effort showed that \u201cwe need a better vision for how we create value for employees \u2014 a vision for their success.\u201d\n \u201cWe have always wanted to be Earth\u2019s most customer-centric company,\u201d he wrote. Now, he added, \u201cwe are going to be Earth\u2019s best employer and Earth\u2019s  safest place to work.\u201d\n Amazon is also  on pace to become the nation\u2019s largest private employer within a year or two, as it continues expanding. About a million people in the United States, most of them hourly workers, now rely on the company\u2019s wages and benefits. Many describe the job as rewarding. Adama Ndoye had supported her family on her JFK8 pay while attending college remotely. \u201cLights on, food, clothes, everything,\u201d she said. Dawn George, a chef, said she was grateful to JFK8 for taking her in after hotel kitchen jobs disappeared last spring. \u201cI\u2019m willing to work my socks off just for an hourly income,\u201d she said.\n Some admire Amazon\u2019s ambition. \u201cIt was like being a pitcher on a team that had a game every night,\u201d said Dan Cavagnaro, who started at JFK8 when it opened in 2018 and worked with Mr. Castillo.\n  But Mr. Cavagnaro was mistakenly fired in July while trying to return from leave, and could not reach anyone to help.\n \u201cPlease note the following,\u201d he wrote in his final, unanswered email plea. \u201cI WISH TO REMAIN EMPLOYED WITH AMAZON.\u201d\n   In late March 2020, Traci Weishalla walked the length of JFK8, forgoing the fluorescent vest that marked her as a manager. She wanted an unfiltered look at what she would soon be helping to oversee: a warehouse the size of 15 football fields, serving America\u2019s largest metropolis just as it was becoming the national epicenter of the pandemic.\n The noise, from conveyor belts whipping around packages, was like the roar of an oncoming subway train. Built to conquer the most lucrative market in the country, the facility ran almost 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n Ms. Weishalla had helped open the warehouse a year and a half earlier, and now \u2014 as homebound customers across the nation  clamored for thermometers, disinfectant and puzzles \u2014 she saw opportunity and purpose in her return as assistant general manager. For an organization that dealt in logistical miracles, the coronavirus was just another obstacle to overcome, she said.\n \u201cThat\u2019s what we do,\u201d Ms. Weishalla, 38, explained later. \u201cWe work to figure out the impossible problems.\u201d\n  But Amazon\u2019s mighty system was lurching. Semi trucks sat at warehouses around the country, without enough workers to unload them. Customers discovered that items the company had deemed nonessential might take a month to arrive \u2014 an eternity for a business that had routinely delivered within two days.\n   To lure them back, Amazon offered a temporary $2-an-hour raise, double pay for overtime and, for the first time, unlimited unpaid time off. Executives thought that workers should be able to stay home without fear of being fired, and that with greater flexibility, some might still come in for part of a shift, according to two people familiar with the decision. (Like some other senior leaders in this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment.)\n  Across the country, almost a third of Amazon\u2019s 500,000 workers were staying home. Some new hires abandoned jobs before they even began, according to former recruiters. JFK8 \u201cwas like a ghost town,\u201d recalled Arthur Turner, a worker who remained.\n Even Alberto Castillo considered staying home. The numbers on the news were unfathomable: at least 20,000 New Yorkers already infected, city hospitals jammed, as many as 1.7 million deaths projected nationwide.\n But this was no time to go without his income: The Castillos, immigrants from the Philippines, yearned to buy a house. He worked nights, troubleshooting and training with gentle mastery, frequent jokes and \u201cStar Wars\u201d references, colleagues said, and he had just applied for a promotion.\n JFK8 was also giving contradictory instructions: Despite Amazon\u2019s promise of unpaid time off, workers were alerted that every department would be on mandatory overtime.\n When Mr. Castillo arrived on March 24, he heard the warehouse had its first positive case. He messaged his boss, who replied, \u201cYes, forgot to bring that up,\u201d and added that everyone who worked with the employee had been notified. Mr. Castillo called his wife to discuss whether to head home. They decided he would finish out his shift.\n    That morning, two workers drove in the opposite direction, beelined to JFK8\u2019s break room and told dozens of colleagues: The virus had breached the warehouse, Amazon could not be trusted to tell them the truth and the facility should be shut down.\n Derrick Palmer and Chris Smalls, Amazon teammates and best friends, weren\u2019t part of any formal effort. Their employer considered unionization a dire threat, and had even backed out of building a second headquarters in New York  in part over potential labor-organizing plans. A  retail workers\u2019 union had once boldly declared that JFK8 would become the first unionized Amazon warehouse in the country, but the effort had died.\n Both men had been at Amazon since 2015 and knew the company from the lowest rungs. Mr. Palmer, then 31, was observant and deliberate, so fit that he often headed to the gym after a 10-hour shift. After dropping out of community college, he worked in a string of warehouses, joined Amazon and was now a \u201cpicker\u201d at JFK8, pulling products off robotic shelves. He often produced top numbers on the software that tracked productivity, and had been selected to train others and help open a warehouse in Illinois.\n He also felt let down, believing that Amazon\u2019s towering success didn\u2019t accrue to workers like him. Employees felt managed largely by app, algorithm and strict but poorly explained rules, he said. When he met Ms. Weishalla at a 2019 session for workers to share feedback, he said, he requested more human interaction from management and told her he aspired to a job like hers. But he saw no changes. \u201cIf we go beyond the requirements, there\u2019s no reward,\u201d he said in an interview.\n  When Mr. Palmer last sought a promotion, in early 2020, he was among 382 people who applied for the position. Though he didn\u2019t know it, the odds were steep by design, an outgrowth of Mr. Bezos\u2019 management philosophies.\n Amazon intentionally limited upward mobility for hourly workers, said Mr. Niekerk, the former H.R. vice president who retired in 2016 after nearly 17 years at the company. Dave Clark, then head of operations, had shot down his proposal around 2014 to create more leadership roles for hourly employees, similar to noncommissioned officers in the military, he recalled.\n Instead, Mr. Clark, who is now chief executive of Amazon\u2019s consumer business, wanted to double down on hiring \u201cwicked smart\u201d frontline managers straight out of college, Mr. Niekerk said. By contrast, more than 75 percent of managers in Walmart\u2019s U.S. stores started as hourly employees. Following a pattern across Amazon, JFK8 promoted 220 people last year among its more than 5,000 employees, a rate that is less than half of Walmart\u2019s.\n Amazon\u2019s founder didn\u2019t want hourly workers to stick around for long, viewing \u201ca large, disgruntled\u201d work force as a threat, Mr. Niekerk recalled. Company data showed that most employees became less eager over time, he said, and Mr. Bezos believed that people were inherently lazy. \u201cWhat he would say is that our nature as humans is to expend as little energy as possible to get what we want or need.\u201d That conviction was  embedded throughout the business, from the ease of instant ordering to the pervasive use of data to get the most out of employees.\n So guaranteed wage increases stopped after three years, and Amazon provided incentives for low-skilled employees to leave. Every year, Mr. Palmer saw signs go up offering associates thousands of dollars to resign, and as he entered JFK8 each morning, he passed a classroom for free courses to train them in other fields.\n Mr. Agboka, the H.R. leader, said while the company offered training and careers at Amazon to those interested, it was proud to also provide people short-term employment for the \u201cseasons and periods of time\u201d they need.\n  As the virus arrived at JFK8, Mr. Palmer worried about how Amazon would protect and communicate with workers. Notification about the warehouse\u2019s first positive case had been uneven. A colleague working near Mr. Smalls had appeared sick, her eyes bloodshot as she struggled through her shift.\n The two men saw only one solution: for JFK8 to pause, clean and reassess, as an Amazon facility in Queens had briefly done. Unpaid leave wasn\u2019t enough, they said \u2014 a company run by the richest man on earth shouldn\u2019t force workers to choose between safety and a paycheck.\n    \u201cAre you guys actually just picking essential items?\u201d one asked, referring to Amazon\u2019s early-pandemic efforts to ship only necessary merchandise.\n  Nearly all the workers in the group were Black, like Mr. Palmer and Mr. Smalls, or Latino. So were more than 60 percent of associates at JFK8, according to internal Amazon records from 2019. Management, the documents show, was more than 70 percent white or Asian. Black associates at JFK8 were almost 50 percent more likely to be fired \u2014 whether for productivity, misconduct, or not showing up for work \u2014 than their white peers, the records show.

Mr. Palmer carried a sign that read, \u201cTreat your workers like your customers.\u201d\n In Seattle, executives still grappling with cratering attendance sought to minimize the protest but instead drew more  attention to it. Amazon fired Mr. Smalls, saying his demonstration had violated a quarantine order based on his contact with the sick co-worker.

The My Book Live and My Book Live Duo devices received its final firmware update in 2015. We understand that our customers\u2019 data is very important. We are actively investigating the issue and will provide an updated advisory when we have more information.\u201d\n Western Digital\u2019s  brief advisory includes  a link to an entry in the National Vulnerability Database for CVE-2018-18472. The NVD writeup says Western Digital WD My Book Live and WD My Book Live Duo (all versions) have a root Remote Command Execution bug.\n \u201cIt can be triggered by anyone who knows the IP address of the affected device, as exploited in the wild in June 2021 for factory reset commands,\u201d NVD wrote.\n Examine the CVE attached to this flaw and you\u2019ll notice it was issued in 2018. The  NVD\u2019s advisory credits VPN reviewer  Wizcase.com with reporting the bug to Western Digital three years ago, back in June 2018.\n In some ways, it\u2019s remarkable that it took this long for vulnerable MyBook devices to be attacked: The 2018 Wizcase writeup on the flaw includes proof-of-concept code that lets anyone run commands on the devices as the all-powerful \u201croot\u201d user.\n Western Digital\u2019s response at the time was that the affected devices were no longer supported and that customers should avoid connecting them to the Internet. That response also suggested this bug has been present in its devices for at least a decade.\n \u201cThe vulnerability report CVE-2018-18472 affects My Book Live devices originally introduced to the market between 2010 and 2012,\u201d reads a reply from Western Digital that Wizcase  posted to its blog. \u201cThese products have been discontinued since 2014 and are no longer covered under our device software support lifecycle. We encourage users who wish to continue operating these legacy products to configure their firewall to prevent remote access to these devices, and to take measures to ensure that only trusted devices on the local network have access to the device.\u201d\n  Wizcase said the flaw it found in MyBook devices also may be present in certain models of  WD MyCloud network attached storage (NAS) devices, although Western Digital\u2019s advisory makes no mention of its MyCloud line being affected.\n The vulnerable MyBook devices are popular among home users and small businesses because they\u2019re relatively feature-rich and inexpensive, and can be upgraded with additional storage quite easily. But these products also make it simple for users to access their files remotely over the Internet using a mobile app.\n I\u2019m guessing it is primarily users who\u2019ve configured their MyBooks to be remotely accessible who are experiencing these unfortunate drive wipes. Regardless, it\u2019s probably safest to observe Western Digital\u2019s advice and disconnect any MyBooks you have from ethernet access.\n If you\u2019d still like to keep your MyBook connected to your local network (at least until you can find a suitable backup for your backups), please make double sure remote access is not enabled in your device settings (see screenshot above).\n       \u201cNo longer supported\u201d shouldn\u2019t mean \u201cSay goodbye to your data!\u2019\n  There will always be a limit on how long manufacturers support their products. The more you pay the more support you can (or should) expect, but sooner or later it will end. And these customers can jump to any cheap as chips product from another manufacturer, yet the rules will be the same. Sorry for life being so hard on you.\n  Top hints: \u201cdefault password \u2018admin,\u2019 \u201d followed by \u201cfinal firmware update in 2015,\u201d and \u201cCVE-2018\u2026\u201d It\u2019s almost as though individuals are copying the cybersecurity practices of corporations!\n    I\u2019m not so sure\u2026WD did state that the device should not be connected to the Internet (but probably not in anything sent to people they knew had bought the device). The vulnerability was identified 3 years after they stopped producing it, and at this point it has been 6 years since the last one was produced.\n I\u2019m with Brian\u2026the surprising thing is that it took three years after the vulnerability with POC was exploited (at least on any scale).\n  There will always be a limit on how long manufacturers support their products. The more you pay the more support you can (or should) expect, but sooner or later it will end. And these customers can jump to any cheap as chips product from another manufacturer, yet the rules will be the same. Sorry for life being so hard on you.\n  Not victim shaming, but what the heck are you doing exposing a personal hard drive to the web in the first place?\n  I\u2019m a tech from way back and I also have external hard drives plugged up to my computer, two of them WD brand, but I never made use of the online cloud service provided by WD. In the world before cloud computing was available, I copied everything to two separate hard drives and then handed one to my father and another one to my grandmother and they stored them in the back of some closets in their own homes for years. My logic at the time was this: if there\u2019s ever a fire or some other kind of disaster, at least my data is safe in two different backup locations.\n  The first paragraph\u2019s use of \u201cpreviously unknown\u201d is either confusing (there\u2019s a 3-year old CVE and POC) or tautological (everything we know is \u201cpreviously unknown\u201d). Admittedly a nit, but one an article skimmer might think excuses WD somewhat.\n  &gt; Regardless, it\u2019s probably safest to observe Western Digital\u2019s advice and disconnect any MyBooks you have from **ethernet** access.\n Was this supposed to be **internet** access? Not nitpicking here, just wouldn\u2019t want anyone to think \u201coh it\u2019s ok mine\u2019s on WiFi not Ethernet\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-26 07:59:33", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

", "note_en": "Researchers have dropped a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit on Twitter for a known cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA). The move comes as reports surface of in-the-wild exploitation of the bug.\n Researchers at Positive Technologies published the PoC for the bug (CVE-2020-3580) on Thursday. One of the researchers there, Mikhail Klyuchnikov, noted that there were a heap of researchers now chasing after an exploit for the bug, which he termed \u201clow-hanging\u201d fruit.\n   The hunt for low hanging CVE-2020-3580 by  @ptswarm has begun. A lot of submissions/duplicates are waiting for  @Bugcrowd and  @Hacker0x01  #bugbounty\n  Meanwhile, Tenable researchers published an alert about the PoC, noting that it has started to see cyberattacks using the vulnerability on targets in the wild.\n \u201cTenable has also received a report that attackers are exploiting CVE-2020-3580 in the wild,\u201d according to its  Thursday alert. \u201cWith this new information, Tenable recommends that organizations prioritize patching CVE-2020-3580.\u201d\n And indeed, the PT PoC tweet was met with plenty of \u201cOoh thanks\u201d and \u201cthank you so much\u201d responses, presumably from would-be hackers.\n   Meanwhile, researchers at WebSec noted that the bug could be exploited for more than XSS:\n You could have gotten 2 CVE numbers for this, as this is not just XSS but also CSRF.\n  \u201cResearchers often develop PoCs before reporting a vulnerability to a developer and publishing them allows other researchers to both check their work and potentially dig further and discover other issues,\u201d Claire Tills, senior research engineer at Tenable, told Threatpost. \u201cPoCs can also be used by defenders to develop detections for vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, giving that valuable information to defenders means it can also end up in the hands of attackers.\u201d\n Given that a patch has been available for this vulnerability for several months, organizations are able to protect themselves which isn\u2019t the case with 0-day disclosures, she pointed out. \u201cHowever, unpatched vulnerabilities continue to haunt many organizations,\u201d Tillis added. \u201cThe public availability of a PoC is another stark reminder that effective patching is a vital step for organizations to protect themselves.\u201d\n  The Cisco ASA is a  cybersecurity perimeter-defense appliance that combines firewall, antivirus, intrusion prevention and virtual private network (VPN) capabilities, all meant to stop threats from making it onto corporate networks. A compromise of the device is akin to unlocking the front door of the castle for storming cyberattackers.\n XSS attacks occur when malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites; any visitors to the compromised websites are thus subject to drive-by attacks.\n Successful exploitation in this case means that unauthenticated, remote attackers could \u201cexecute arbitrary code within the [ASA] interface and access sensitive, browser-based information,\u201d Tenable added.\n Once in, they could modify the device\u2019s configuration, according to Leo Pate, an application security consultant at nVisium.\n However, the target would need to be logged into the ASA for the attackers to see any joy. \u201cWhile this sounds dangerous, exploiting this vulnerability requires an administrative user to login and navigate to the webpage where the attacker uploaded the malicious code,\u201d he added.\n As Tenable researchers said: \u201cAn attacker would need to convince \u2018a user of the interface\u2019 to click on a specially crafted link.\u201d This can be accomplished via a spear-phishing email campaign targeting probable ASA users using malicious links, or via watering-hole attacks.\n \u201cThe attack vector to get this in the hands of the right people is complex requiring a firewall administrator to be duped into clicking a cleverly crafted link,\u201d Andrew Barratt, managing principal for solutions and investigations at Coalfire, told Threatpost. \u201cFirewall administrators will need to ensure they\u2019re not accessing links to the ASA interface that appear to originate from outside.\u201d\n  Thanks to the sheer size of its footprint (including inside Fortune 500 companies), the Cisco ASA is no stranger to attention from cyberattackers. Last year for example, public PoC for another bug in the device ( CVE-2020-3452) started making the rounds, leading to a  spate of exploitation efforts.\n  The flaw tracked as CVE-2020-3580  was patched on October 21 as part of a group of XSS issues in Cisco\u2019s ASA as well as the Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) software, which is a unified firewall image that includes ASA management.\n \u201cAll four vulnerabilities exist because Cisco ASA and FTD software web services do not sufficiently validate user-supplied inputs,\u201d according to the advisory, which noted that the bug in question rates 6.1 out of 10 on the CVSSv3 vulnerability-severity scale.\n The number of vulnerable devices could be significant:  Researchers with Rapid7 last year found there to be 85,000 internet-accessible ASA devices. Of course, a good percentage of those could be patched against this particular vulnerability.\n \u201cExploits for appliances that may sit on the vanishing perimeter generally garner interest [from hackers], but fortunately in this case there are at least two things working against rampant exploitation,\u201d Tim Wade, technical director for the CTO team at Vectra, told Threatpost. \u201cFirst, a patch has been available since October. Second, an element of social engineering is required. This should provide some level of confidence for organizations with reasonable patch cycles and a security awareness program.\u201d\n Updating to the latest versions of the affected devices\u2019 software is of course recommended; however, there\u2019s more that can be done to mitigate the vulnerability, nVisium\u2019s Pate noted.\n \u201cOrganizations can ask their internal teams if they need to use the web management interface, and if so, is it available to everyone on the internet or just internally to our organization? If the web management interface isn\u2019t needed, then it should be disabled,\u201d he told Threatpost.\n Join Threatpost for \u201c  Tips and Tactics for Better Threat Hunting \u201d \u2014 a LIVE event on\u00a0  Wed., June 30 at 2:00 PM ET \u00a0in partnership with Palo Alto Networks.

\u201cThot Shit,\u201d some Black TikTok creators began  calling attention to that exploitation this week, inspiring others to  refuse to choreograph a dance to the hit song. The idea behind the movement is that Black artists on the platform create a disproportionate amount of content and culture \u2014 much of which is  re-packaged and monetized by popular white creators and culture at large.\n The song choice probably isn\u2019t a coincidence. The Megan Thee Stallion video is both a playful but important paean to essential workers \u2014 twerking grocery, food service and sanitation workers, in this case \u2014 and a biting commentary on the wealthy white establishment that exploits their labor without thinking twice.\n   The \u201cstrike\u201d doesn\u2019t have creators leaving the platform or even staying off of the app. Instead, Black creators who might normally contribute dances for the hot new song are sitting back and  pointing to what happens when they\u2019re not around. (Predictably: not a lot.)\n On the sound\u2019s page, some videos tease choreography but pivot into a statement about how  Black creators don\u2019t get their due on the app. In other videos, Black creators watch on in horror at awkward dance attempts failing to fill the void or laugh about how the song\u2019s lyrics are instructional but  non-Black TikTok still can\u2019t figure it out. The eminently danceable \u201cThot shit\u201d could build into Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s biggest hit yet, but just looking on TikTok you wouldn\u2019t know it.\n  When reached for comment on the phenomenon, TikTok praised Black creators as a \u201ccritical and vibrant\u201d part of the community. \u201cWe care deeply about the experience of Black creators on our platform and we continue to work every day to create a supportive environment for our community while also instilling a culture where honoring and crediting creators for their creative contributions is the norm,\u201d a TikTok spokesperson said.\n Many TikTok accounts participating in the strike  cite a recent explosion of white TikTokkers lip-syncing obliviously to a clip of Nicki Minaj\u2019s 2016 song \u201cBlack Barbies\u201d that  specifically praises Black bodies (\u201cI\u2019m a fucking Black Barbie/Pretty face, perfect body\u2026\u201d). White TikTok inexplicably flocked to the sound, boosting its popularity and crowding out Black creators. It\u2019s just one incident in a long history of Black creators feeling exploited and appropriated on social networks. Black TikTok dancers have long been left in the cold: Their original dance moves explode in popularity and get picked up by non-Black creators, who also pick up the credit along the way.\n The TikTok strike truly is amazing b/c it shows not only how US pop culture is built on stealing from Black people, but how the music industry depends on this cycle of theft &amp; white washing in order to monetize the music.\n The recent strike is the latest beat in the ongoing conversation over who gets to cash in on the wellspring of creativity that pours out of a platform like TikTok. More broadly, some creators believe that  TikTok\u2019s economics are stacked against them, even compared to other major platforms like YouTube. Across social media sites, creators,  particularly creators of color, are turning to collective action and  even unionizing to assert their power.\n For Black creators tired of seeing their work appropriated, collectively refusing to gift the world a hot new TikTok dance is certainly one way to show just how vital they are to the online ecosystem \u2014 something even a quick glance at the desolate \u201cThot Shit\u201d sound makes abundantly clear.", "posttime": "2021-06-26 07:22:05", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5f00\u53d1,\u9ed1\u8272,black,tiktok", "title": "\u5728Tiktok\uff0c\u9ed1\u8272\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u821e\u8e48\u7f62\u5de5\u547c\u5524\u7740\u521b\u9020\u6027\u7684\u5f00\u53d1 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tOn TikTok, Black creators\u2019 dance strike calls out creative exploitation\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/tiktok-strike-black-creators-thot-megan-thee-stallion/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5f00\u53d1", "\u9ed1\u8272", "black", "tiktok"]}]
