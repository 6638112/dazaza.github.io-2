"note_en": "A giant flywheel in north-east  Scotland could soon help to prevent blackouts across Britain by mimicking the effect of a power station but without using fossil fuels.\n The trailblazing project near Keith in Moray, thought to cost about \u00a325m, will not generate electricity or produce carbon emissions \u2013 but it could help keep the lights on by stabilising the energy grid\u2019s electrical frequency.\n The Norwegian energy company Statkraft hopes that from next winter the new flywheel, designed by a division of General Electric, will be able to mimic the spinning turbines of a traditional power station, which have helped  to balance the grid\u2019s frequency at about 50 hertz for decades.\n  Currently, the  National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO) is forced to shut down windfarms and run gas power stations even when there is more than enough renewable energy to meet Britain\u2019s electricity demand, in order to keep the grid\u2019s frequency steady.\n By simulating the spinning metal mass of a power station turbine without producing emissions, Statkraft should be able to help ESO rely less on fossil fuels and use renewable energy more.\n This is the first time a project of this kind will be used anywhere in the world and ESO believes it could be a \u201chuge step forward\u201d in running a zero-carbon electricity grid.\n The task of keeping the electrical frequency of the grid steady is becoming more challenging because Britain\u2019s growing stable of renewable energy projects do not use the same giant spinning turbines that typically help to keep frequency stable.\n  In August last year more than a million people across the UK were plunged into darkness during one of  the worst power blackouts in more than a decade after the frequency of the grid fell to 48.88Hz.\n Since then, National Grid ESO has accelerated plans for new blackout safeguards to avoid another energy system shock, including schemes and  new technologies that can help protect the grid\u2019s frequency without increasing its carbon footprint.\n \u201cOur contracts for stability services with providers such as Statkraft are cheaper and greener, reducing emissions and saving money for electricity consumers,\u201d said Julian Leslie, the head of networks at National Grid ESO. \u201cThis approach is the first of its kind anywhere in the world and is a huge step forward in our ambition to be able to operate the GB electricity system carbon-free by 2025.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-07-06 22:04:19", "source_domain":

This project received plenty of attention, but it is difficult for most people to make such a keyboard. We believe that a Python powered keyboard will make a big difference. We&#39;d really like to take this work further, so we start to design a new keyboard hardware. It is called  M60.\n M60 uses Nordic\u2019s nRF52840 SoC to provide USB Type-C wired and Bluetooth LE 5.0 wireless connectivity. It can easily pair to your PC, laptop, smartphone, or tablet with Bluetooth LE.\n It&#39;s not just a keyboard but also a USB drive containing Python files.

80% of global Internet traffic. H.266/VVC represents the pinnacle of (at least) four generations of international standards for video coding. The previous standards H.264/Advanced Video Coding (AVC) and H.265/HEVC, which were produced with substantial contributions from Fraunhofer HHI, remain active in more than 10 billion end devices, processing over 90% of the total global volume of video bits. Both previous standards were also recognized by collectively three Emmy Engineering Awards for contributing substantially to the progress of television technology.  Through a reduction of data requirements, H.266/VVC makes video transmission in mobile networks (where data capacity is limited) more efficient. For instance, the previous standard H.265/HEVC requires ca. 10 gigabytes of data to transmit a 90-min UHD video. With this new technology, only 5 gigabytes of data are required to achieve the same quality. Because H.266/VVC was developed with ultra-high-resolution video content in mind, the new standard is particularly beneficial when streaming 4K or 8K videos on a flat screen TV. Furthermore, H.266/VVC is ideal for all types of moving images: from high-resolution 360\u00b0 video panoramas to screen sharing contents.  \u201cAfter dedicating almost three years toward this standard, we are proud to have been instrumental in developing H.266/VVC,&#34; says Benjamin Bross, head of the Video Coding Systems group at Fraunhofer HHI and editor of the +500-page standard specification of H.266/VVC. \u201cBecause of the quantum leap in coding efficiency offered by H.266/VVC, the use of video will increase further worldwide. Moreover, the increased versatility of H.266/VVC makes its use more attractive for a broader range of applications related to the transmission and storage of video.\u201d  &#34;If you consider that Fraunhofer HHI already played a key role in the development of the previous video coding standards H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC, then we are happy with the fact that more than 50% of the bits on the Internet are generated by a Fraunhofer HHI technology,\u201d adds Dr. Detlev Marpe, head of the Video Coding and Analytics department at Fraunhofer HHI.  A uniform and transparent licensing model based on the FRAND principle (i.e., fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory) is planned to be established for the use of standard essential patents related to H.266/VVC. For this purpose, the Media Coding Industry Forum (MC-IF) was founded. In addition to Fraunhofer Society, the MC-IF now includes +30 companies and organizations. The new chips required for the use of H.266/VVC, such as those in mobile devices, are currently being designed. Dr. Thomas Schierl, head of the Video Coding and Analytics department at Fraunhofer HHI, announced \u201cthis autumn Fraunhofer HHI will publish the first software (for both encoder and decoder) to support H.266/VVC.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-07-06 21:44:40", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6807\u51c6,standard,\u89c6\u9891", "title":

"note_en": "This is the second part in a series on WebAssembly and what makes it fast. If you haven\u2019t read the others, we recommend  starting from the beginning.\n JavaScript started out slow, but then got faster thanks to something called the JIT. But how does the JIT work?\n  When you as a developer add JavaScript to the page, you have a goal and a problem.\n   You speak a human language, and the computer speaks a machine language. Even if you don\u2019t think about JavaScript or other high-level programming languages as human languages, they really are. They\u2019ve been designed for human cognition, not for machine cognition.\n So the job of the JavaScript engine is to take your human language and turn it into something the machine understands.\n I think of this like the movie  Arrival, where you have humans and aliens who are trying to talk to each other.\n  In that movie, the humans and aliens don\u2019t just do word-for-word translations. The two groups have different ways of thinking about the world. And that\u2019s true of humans and machines too (I\u2019ll explain this more in the next post).\n  In programming, there are generally two ways of translating to machine language. You can use an interpreter or a compiler.\n   A compiler on the other hand doesn\u2019t translate on the fly. It works ahead of time to create that translation and write it down.\n    Interpreters are quick to get up and running. You don\u2019t have to go through that whole compilation step before you can start running your code. You just start translating that first line and running it.\n Because of this, an interpreter seems like a natural fit for something like JavaScript. It\u2019s important for a web developer to be able to get going and run their code quickly.\n  But the con of using an interpreter comes when you\u2019re running the same code more than once. For example, if you\u2019re in a loop. Then you have to do the same translation over and over and over again.\n   It takes a little bit more time to start up because it has to go through that compilation step at the beginning. But then code in loops runs faster, because it doesn\u2019t need to repeat the translation for each pass through that loop.\n Another difference is that the compiler has more time to look at the code and make edits to it so that it will run faster. These edits are called optimizations.\n The interpreter is doing its work during runtime, so it can\u2019t take much time during the translation phase to figure out these optimizations.\n  As a way of getting rid of the interpreter\u2019s inefficiency\u2014where the interpreter has to keep retranslating the code every time they go through the loop\u2014browsers started mixing compilers in.\n Different browsers do this in slightly different ways, but the basic idea is the same. They added a new part to the JavaScript engine, called a monitor (aka a profiler). That monitor watches the code as it runs, and makes a note of how many times it is run and what types are used.\n   If the same lines of code are run a few times, that segment of code is called warm. If it\u2019s run a lot, then it\u2019s called hot.\n  When a function starts getting warm, the JIT will send it off to be compiled. Then it will store that compilation.\n  Each line of the function is compiled to a \u201cstub\u201d. The stubs are indexed by line number and variable type (I\u2019ll explain why that\u2019s important later). If the monitor sees that execution is hitting the same code again with the same variable types, it will just pull out its compiled version.\n That helps speed things up. But like I said, there\u2019s more a compiler can do. It can take some time to figure out the most efficient way to do things\u2026 to make optimizations.\n The baseline compiler will make some of these optimizations (I give an example of one below). It doesn\u2019t want to take too much time, though, because it doesn\u2019t want to hold up execution too long.\n However, if the code is really hot\u2014if it\u2019s being run a whole bunch of times\u2014then it\u2019s worth taking the extra time to make more optimizations.\n  When a part of the code is very hot, the monitor will send it off to the optimizing compiler. This will create another, even faster, version of the function that will also be stored.\n  In order to make a faster version of the code, the optimizing compiler has to make some assumptions.\n For example, if it can assume that all objects created by a particular constructor have the same shape\u2014that is, that they always have the same property names, and that those properties were added in the same order\u2014 then it can cut some corners based on that.\n The optimizing compiler uses the information the monitor has gathered by watching code execution to make these judgments. If something has been true for all previous passes through a loop, it assumes it will continue to be true.\n But of course with JavaScript, there are never any guarantees. You could have 99 objects that all have the same shape, but then the 100th might be missing a property.\n So the compiled code needs to check before it runs to see whether the assumptions are valid. If they are, then the compiled code runs. But if not, the JIT assumes that it made the wrong assumptions and trashes the optimized code.\n  Then execution goes back to the interpreter or baseline compiled version. This process is called deoptimization (or bailing out).\n Usually optimizing compilers make code faster, but sometimes they can cause unexpected performance problems. If you have code that keeps getting optimized and then deoptimized, it ends up being slower than just executing the baseline compiled version.\n Most browsers have added limits to break out of these optimization/deoptimization cycles when they happen. If the JIT has made more than, say, 10 attempts at optimizing and keeps having to throw it out, it will just stop trying.\n  There are a lot of different kinds of optimizations, but I want to take a look at one type so you can get a feel for how optimization happens. One of the biggest wins in optimizing compilers comes from something called type specialization.\n The dynamic type system that JavaScript uses requires a little bit of extra work at runtime. For example, consider this code:\n function arraySum(arr) { var sum = 0; for (var i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) { sum += arr[i]; }}\n The  += step in the loop may seem simple. It may seem like you can compute this in one step, but because of dynamic typing, it takes more steps than you would expect.\n Let\u2019s assume that  arr is an array of 100 integers. Once the code warms up, the baseline compiler will create a stub for each operation in the function. So there will be a stub for  sum += arr[i], which will handle the  += operation as integer addition.\n However, sum and  arr[i] aren\u2019t guaranteed to be integers. Because types are dynamic in JavaScript, there\u2019s a chance that in a later iteration of the loop,  arr[i] will be a string. Integer addition and string concatenation are two very different operations, so they would compile to very different machine code.\n The way the JIT handles this is by compiling multiple baseline stubs. If a piece of code is monomorphic (that is, always called with the same types) it will get one stub. If it is polymorphic (called with different types from one pass through the code to another), then it will get a stub for each combination of types that has come through that operation.\n This means that the JIT has to ask a lot of questions before it chooses a stub.\n  Because each line of code has its own set of stubs in the baseline compiler, the JIT needs to keep checking the types each time the line of code is executed. So for each iteration through the loop, it will have to ask the same questions.\n  The code would execute a lot faster if the JIT didn\u2019t need to repeat those checks. And that\u2019s one of the things the optimizing compiler does.\n In the optimizing compiler, the whole function is compiled together. The type checks are moved so that they happen before the loop.\n  Some JITs optimize this even further. For example, in Firefox there\u2019s a special classification for arrays that only contain integers. If  arr is one of these arrays, then the JIT doesn\u2019t need to check if  arr[i] is an integer. This means that the JIT can do all of the type checks before it enters the loop.\n  That is the JIT in a nutshell. It makes JavaScript run faster by monitoring the code as it\u2019s running it and sending hot code paths to be optimized. This has resulted in many-fold performance improvements for most JavaScript applications.\n Even with these improvements, though, the performance of JavaScript can be unpredictable. And to make things faster, the JIT has added some overhead during runtime, including:\n memory used for the monitor\u2019s bookkeeping and recovery information for when bailouts happen\n There\u2019s room for improvement here: that overhead could be removed, making performance more predictable. And that\u2019s one of the things that WebAssembly does.\n In the  next article, I\u2019ll explain more about assembly and how compilers work with it.", "posttime": "2020-07-06 21:19:11",

"note_en": "Halt and Catch Fire is an American  period drama television series created by  Christopher Cantwell and Christopher C. Rogers. It aired on the cable network  AMC in the United States from June 1, 2014, to October 14, 2017, spanning four seasons and 40 episodes.  [1]  [2] Taking place over a period of more than ten years, the series depicts a fictionalized insider&#39;s view of the  personal computer revolution of the 1980s and the  growth of the World Wide Web in the early 1990s.  [3] The show&#39;s title refers to computer  machine code instruction  Halt and Catch Fire (HCF), the  execution of which would cause the computer&#39;s  central processing unit to stop working ( catch fire being a humorous exaggeration).  [4]\n In season one, the company Cardiff Electric makes its first foray into personal computing, with entrepreneur Joe MacMillan ( Lee Pace) running a project to build an  IBM PC clone with the help of  computer engineer Gordon Clark ( Scoot McNairy) and prodigy  programmer Cameron Howe ( Mackenzie Davis). Seasons two and three shift focus to a  startup company, the  online community Mutiny, that is headed by Cameron and Gordon&#39;s wife Donna ( Kerry Bish\u00e9), while Joe ventures out on his own. The fourth and final season focuses on competing  web search engines involving all the principal characters.\n Halt and Catch Fire marked Cantwell&#39;s and Rogers&#39;s first jobs in television. They wrote the pilot hoping to use it to secure jobs as writers in the industry but instead landed a series of their own from AMC. The story was inspired by Cantwell&#39;s childhood in the  Silicon Prairie of Dallas\u2013Fort Worth, where his father worked as a software salesman, and the creators&#39; subsequent research into Texas&#39;s role in personal computing innovations of the 1980s. Filmed in the  Atlanta, Georgia, area and produced by the network, the series is set in the Silicon Prairie for its first two seasons and  Silicon Valley for its latter two.  [5]  [6]\n Halt and Catch Fire debuted to generally favorable reviews, though many reviewers initially found it derivative of other series such as   Mad Men. In each subsequent season, the series grew in acclaim, and by the time it concluded, critics considered it among the best shows of the 2010s. Despite its critical reception, the series experienced low viewership ratings throughout its run, with only the first episode surpassing one\u00a0million viewers for its initial broadcast.\n     Lee Pace as Joe MacMillan: an  entrepreneur and former  IBM sales executive who joins Cardiff Electric and instigates a project to reverse engineer the  IBM PC.  [7] Joe is a charismatic, slick-talking businessman and a tech visionary obsessed with pursuing &#34;the next big thing&#34;,  [8]  [9] despite lacking technical skills.  [10] Owing to his original conception as an  antihero,  [11] Joe uses manipulative tactics in his endeavors,  [8]  [12] bending people to his will to get what he wants.  [13] He is portrayed as an enigmatic figure with a dark backstory,  [14] having left IBM under mysterious circumstances.  [15]   The Sydney Morning Herald described Joe as an &#34;acutely damaged man underneath the slick suits, bravado and motivational speak&#34;,  [16] while Pace said his character was hiding behind a persona.  [11] Critics compared Joe to the  Mad Men character  Don Draper.  [17]  [18]  [19] In subsequent seasons, Joe is humbled by his professional failures and how his actions affect other people, and as he comes to terms with his behavior, he becomes a more empathetic character.  [20]  [21]  [22]  [23] Pace said that Joe&#39;s bisexuality was a reflection of the character being a &#34;mutable person&#34;, &#34;a questioner and a disrupter&#34;, and someone who &#34;doesn&#39;t feel limitations&#34;.  [24] The idea for the character was inspired by co-creator  Christopher Cantwell&#39;s father, who was a software salesman. For Joe&#39;s personality, Pace recalled &#34; corporate raiders and that kind of spirit of &#39;80s excess&#34; upon reading the pilot,  [25] and he took inspiration from real-life figures  Steve Jobs,  Ivan Boesky, and  Michael Milken, as well as the fictional characters  Patrick Bateman and  Gordon Gekko.  [16]  [26]  [27] Later in the series, Joe initiates projects involving  time-sharing,  [28]  antivirus software (MacMillan Utility),  [29] the  NSFNET computer network,  [10] and a  search engine (Comet).\n Scoot McNairy as Gordon Clark: a  computer engineer at Cardiff Electric who Joe recruits to reverse engineer the IBM PC and lead the Giant&#39;s hardware team. After the failure of the Symphonic, a computer he built with his wife Donna years earlier,  [31] Gordon gave up on his dreams and retreated to a dead-end job before having his ambitions reignited by Joe.  [32]  [33] Farhad Manjoo of  The New York Times likened Gordon to  Breaking Bad &#39;s protagonist  Walter White, calling him &#34;apparently brilliant but underutilized in his job, and smugly depressive about his lot in life&#34;.  [34] Cantwell said the creators cast McNairy in the role because they wanted an actor &#34;who could be a nebbish, with his shoulders shrunken in, but then also reveal himself unexpectedly to be a budding alpha male.&#34;  [35] Despite not having a background in computing, McNairy related to his character as a fellow tinkerer and builder, drawing from his interest in fixing engines, radios, and air conditioners and his experience in carpentry.  [36]  [37] McNairy built the foundation of his character on having a  chip on his shoulder and something to prove, which were personality traits he came across from researching computer engineers of the past.  [38] Critics also compared his working dynamic with Joe to that of  Steve Wozniak with Steve Jobs, two co-founders of  Apple Computer.  [39]  [40]  Gordon&#39;s talents are frequently undercut by poor decisions and bad luck,  [42] as well as his deteriorating mental state due to  toxic encephalopathy, the result of extended exposure to lead solder;  [43] Dennis Perkins of   The A.V. Club called him &#34; Halt &#39;s  tragic hero\u2014the dreamer without the necessary piece to ever truly succeed&#34;.  [44] In subsequent seasons, Gordon works at Mutiny,  [45] runs the CalNect  Internet service provider,  [46] and co-founds the Comet search engine.\n  Mackenzie Davis as Cameron Howe (born Catherine Howe): a computer  programming prodigy who is recruited from a university by Joe to join Cardiff Electric and write the Giant&#39;s  BIOS.  [40]  [47] The creators made the character female and a  punk because they wanted to depict someone who was disruptive to the 1980s corporate culture of the tech industry, while her interest in video games was meant to signify the coming generation and technology.  [48] Davis said that her character &#34;doesn&#39;t fit into this male-dominated computer world, nor does she fit into the idea of feminine beauty of Texas and the South&#34; with her androgynous appearance.  [49] A  video game designer,  [50] Cameron later forms her own startup company, the online gaming service Mutiny, and partners with Donna to run it.  [51] For the role, Davis drew from prior experience writing  HTML in a high school class,  [52] and she prepared by watching online programming courses from the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology and by trying to get into the mindset of a college student.  [53] Cameron was inspired by people such as  Sierra On-Line game designer  Roberta Williams,   Centipede designer  Dona Bailey, and pioneering programmers  Grace Hopper and  Ada Lovelace.  [48] Cameron is  anti-social,  [54] and finds the &#34;truest expression of herself&#34; through her work.  [55]  James Poniewozik called her an &#34;idealist who saw computing as art\u2013the machines could have personality, could inspire emotion, could be a place to play&#34;.  Filling the void left by her father&#39;s death during the  Vietnam War, Cameron&#39;s frequent co-worker John Bosworth becomes a  father figure to her.  [57]  [58] After Mutiny, she goes to work for  Atari and develops the successful  Space Bike game series.  [59]\n Kerry Bish\u00e9 as Donna Clark ( n\u00e9e Emerson): a computer engineer at  Texas Instruments.  [60] After a failed attempt to build a computer with her husband Gordon years earlier,  [31] Donna put her dreams on hold to focus on raising their two daughters,  [60]  [61] and she has misgivings about him getting involved in the Giant&#39;s development.  [62] To dispel the notion that her character was merely the disapproving, &#34;wet blanket wife&#34; in a television drama, Bish\u00e9 was adamant that she be able to adroitly disassemble and fix the children&#39;s  Speak &amp; Spell in the series pilot, hinting at the depth of her character.  [63] Donna is eventually enlisted by Gordon to aid Cardiff Electric with the development of the Giant.  [64] Contrasting with her character&#39;s technical expertise, Bish\u00e9 described herself as a  Luddite and in preparing for the role, did not find it necessary to &#34;understand the way the computers work&#34; but rather to &#34;understand the people that understand the way computers work&#34;.  [65] The backstory and first initials of Gordon and Donna were references to  Gary and  Dorothy Kildall, the married couple who founded  Digital Research and whose  CP/M operating system was displaced after IBM&#39;s introduction of  DOS.  [31] After Gordon&#39;s pursuit of his dreams in the first season, Donna takes the opportunity to pursue her own ambitions when she joins Mutiny to co-manage the company with Cameron.  There, she reluctantly &#34;becom[es] den mother to Mutiny&#39;s nerdy employees&#34;,  [66] her pragmatism contrasting with Cameron&#39;s manic work style.  [67] Donna grows into a &#34;savvy businesswoman&#34;, and after Mutiny, she becomes a partner in a  venture capital firm, culminating her evolution from &#34;unfulfilled sidekick to cutthroat Silicon Valley executive&#34;.  [68] Like Cameron, Donna was partially inspired by Williams, Bailey, Hopper, and Lovelace.  [48]\n  Toby Huss as John &#34;Bos&#34; Bosworth: the senior vice president of Cardiff Electric who hires Joe.  [69] John is a back-slapping businessman known for his folksy, &#34; good ol&#39; boy&#34; charm.  [70] In the first season, he represents the &#34;established Texas American capitalist patriarchy&#34;, according to Huss,  [71] and is positioned as an antagonist to the other characters building the Giant.  [11] Huss said the creators initially envisioned the character as an &#34;an older, sedentary kind of conservative Republican Texas guy&#34;,  [57] but they decided to shift course for the character after Huss gave an unexpectedly wiry, energetic performance in his audition.  [11] The writers subsequently wrote to what Rogers called a &#34;really surprising warmth and vulnerability&#34; that Huss brought to the character,  [48] as well as his unexpected chemistry with Davis during their scenes together.  [11] John subsequently becomes a father figure to Cameron, having neglected his own family over the years due to his job.  [57] Huss based his character partly on his uncle Tom, who he described as a &#34;no-nonsense&#34; Houston oilman, and he developed John&#39;s accent by blending the speaking styles of his Iowan father and his Montanan uncle.  [72]  [73] Amidst the changing landscape of the technology industry, John grapples with how to adapt to avoid becoming a &#34;dinosaur aging out of the business&#34;.  [74] In the process, he becomes more open-minded and acknowledges the brilliance of the young developers and their innovations.  [71] After Cardiff Electric, he is hired by Cameron to provide managerial experience at Mutiny,  [75] and later by Donna to oversee the search engine Rover.  [76]\n  Morgan Hinkleman (seasons 1\u20133) and  Kathryn Newton (seasons 3\u20134) as Joanie Clark\n   Halt and Catch Fire was created by  Christopher Cantwell and Christopher C. Rogers, who met while working at  the Walt Disney Company. Cantwell&#39;s online movie company was acquired by Disney and he was moved into its marketing department, while Rogers was hired by Cantwell&#39;s team to manage Disney&#39;s editorial program for social media. After a year of working together, they learned that they had each graduated from  screenwriting programs in college\u2014Cantwell from the  University of Southern California as an undergraduate student, and Rogers from the  University of California, Los Angeles as a graduate student.  [80] Rogers referred to Cantwell and himself as &#34;dream-deferred writers&#34;.  [81] In August 2010, they agreed to collaborate on screenwriting, and their first script, a  pilot about the  assassination of John F. Kennedy called  The Knoll, appeared on  the Black List of popular unproduced screenplays.  [81]  [82] Their  talent agents urged them to produce another script they could use as a staffing sample. Since the agents thought it was unlikely a network would  option a script from first-time writers, their intent was to use the sample script to land them entry-level writing positions in the industry. The agents advised them to write something in which they were personally invested.  [81]\n  Cantwell and Rogers initially discussed telling a &#34;men under pressure&#34; story like   Glengarry Glen Ross, but they were not interested in making the subject matter about doctors or police officers, believing them to be well-trod territory in television.  [47] As they continued to brainstorm for their staffing sample, Cantwell recalled his childhood.  [81] In 1982, when Cantwell was just six weeks old, his father moved their family from  Elgin, Illinois, to  Plano, Texas, to take a job as a  systems software salesman for  UCCEL Corp.  [81]  [83]  [84] As a child, Cantwell was unaware of Texas&#39;s role in the  personal computer revolution of the 1980s, but after speaking to his father and researching the era with Rogers, they learned how the  Silicon Prairie of Dallas\u2013Fort Worth (in which Plano is located) became a secondary technology hub behind California&#39;s  Silicon Valley.  [81] Companies in the Silicon Prairie included  Texas Instruments,  Electronic Data Systems,  Tandy, and  RadioShack, while elsewhere in Texas,  Dell (in Austin) and  Compaq (in Houston) were also prominent players in the  PC industry.  [5]  [80] Executive producer Jonathan Lisco said:  &#34;[Texas] was viewed by a lot of people at the time, per our research, as sort of a catch basin for people who had not succeeded [in Silicon Valley]. On the other hand, there was a lot of wonderful tech going on here.&#34;  [5] Cantwell said that he and Rogers were intrigued by the lesser-known players and settings of the tech industry: &#34;We wanted to find the place you didn&#39;t know. Silicon Valley, Boston, New York,  IBM,  Microsoft, all those stories and companies have been exploited dramatically to great effect.&#34;  [80] In their research, Cantwell and Rogers came across stories of computer engineers at Compaq taking risks in attempting to  reverse engineer the  IBM PC.  [81]  [85] They conceived the pilot for  Halt and Catch Fire in January 2011.  [31] The first eight pages portrayed their protagonist Joe MacMillan at IBM.  [86] In May, Cantwell left Disney,  [86] though Rogers remained until the future of their project was assured.  [81]\n Cantwell and Rogers finished the draft of their pilot in the summer of 2011.  [86] Their agents liked the script, but were not optimistic about selling it. They sent it to several television networks, leading to meetings with  HBO and  Showtime.  [82] In late October,  [86] the writers met with  AMC. By that point, Cantwell had been out of work for five months and was quickly diminishing his savings. He and Rogers were surprised to find that the AMC executives had a copy of their script at the meeting. One of the executives, Ben Davis, said: &#34;We were really interested in trying to tap into that world \u2014 into the spirit of innovation, and the tech world specifically. I loved the idea that it took place in Dallas and that I didn&#39;t hear  Steve Jobs&#39; or  Bill Gates&#39; name. It approached it from the backdoor instead of straight ahead.&#34;  [81] After a second meeting with Cantwell and Rogers on December 5, AMC optioned the script the next day.  [81]  [86] In March 2012, Cantwell learned that AMC would not make a decision about  Halt and Catch Fire until autumn; the news coincided with the depletion of his and his wife&#39;s savings. On October 23, 2012, Cantwell and Rogers pitched the network on how they envisioned  Halt and Catch Fire as a potential series.  [86] The network ordered a pilot the following month.  [87] The project was Cantwell&#39;s and Rogers&#39;s first jobs in the television industry.  [82] Cantwell said, &#34;The first writers&#39; room we walked into was our own.&#34;  [31] The network announced a series order of 10 episodes in July 2013.  [88]\n  In February 2013, it was announced that  Lee Pace had been cast in the lead role of Joe MacMillan, and  Mackenzie Davis in a co-starring role as Cameron Howe.  [89] The following month,  Scoot McNairy was cast as Gordon Clark and  Kerry Bish\u00e9 as Gordon&#39;s wife Donna;  [90]  [91] it was a reunion for McNairy and Bish\u00e9, who had played a married couple in the film   Argo a year prior.  [91] Also in March,  David Wilson Barnes was cast in the pilot as Dale Butler.  [92] Barnes was initially credited among the main cast in the first season, but was written out after just two episodes when the story went in a different direction.  [93] He reprised the character for the series finale.  [94]\n For season two,  Aleksa Palladino joined the cast as a regular, while  James Cromwell and  Mark O&#39;Brien joined as recurring characters.  [95]  [96] For season three,  Manish Dayal was cast as Ryan Ray, an Indian-American computer programmer native to San Francisco. Cantwell and Rogers created the character to match the change in demographic after the series&#39;s setting shifted to Northern California.  [97]  Matthew Lillard and  Annabeth Gish were also cast in recurring roles.  [77] For season four,  Kathryn Newton and Susanna Skaggs were cast to play teenaged versions of the Clarks&#39; daughters, and  Anna Chlumsky joined in a supporting role.  [79]\n Prior to the fourth season, AMC addressed the  gender pay gap among its four leads by giving Davis and Bish\u00e9 salary raises to match what Pace and McNairy were earning. Davis and Bish\u00e9 were relatively unknown when they signed their original deals at lower salaries; Davis was earning the minimum rate at the time. Their characters were given more screen time beginning with the second season, but the actresses did not feel they were being equitably compensated for their work. Before Davis and Bish\u00e9 could renegotiate with AMC, the network gave them unsolicited raises.  [98]\n  Due to Cantwell&#39;s and Rogers&#39;s inexperience, the network wanted experienced producers for the project and brought in Melissa Bernstein and  Mark Johnson, who were producing AMC&#39;s hit television drama   Breaking Bad. They guided Cantwell and Rogers through the process of creating the pilot and were, as the writers called them, their &#34;advocates... with the network&#34;.  [99] AMC also chose to hire someone more experienced in television to be the series&#39;  showrunner.  [100] As part of a two-year deal with AMC, Jonathan Lisco was chosen in July 2013, having just concluded three seasons as executive producer on the television drama series   Southland.  [101] Lisco was impressed by the script for the  Halt and Catch Fire pilot, but initially was unconvinced that he was best-suited for the showrunner role. He did not view himself as a technophile, and wondered if there would be &#34;enough stakes in the  bits and the  bytes&#34;,  [102] saying the subject matter did not &#34;dramatically blow your hair back&#34\n......", "posttime": "2020-07-06 20:59:08", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u505c\u4e0b\u6765,catch", "title":

"note_en": "The deal confirms reports that  emerged last week, and got re-reported last night  with more financial detail, that Postmates and Uber were in negotiations. That deal itself sprung up in the wake of Uber failing to acquire another competitor, Grubhub, which was instead  acquired by Europe\u2019s takeout behemoth Just Eat Takeaway for $7.3 billion.\n \u201cUber and Postmates have long shared a belief that platforms like ours can power much more than just food delivery\u2014they can be a hugely important part of local commerce and communities, all the more important during crises like COVID-19. As more people and more restaurants have come to use our services, Q2 bookings on Uber Eats are up more than 100% year on year. We\u2019re thrilled to welcome Postmates to the Uber family as we innovate together to deliver better experiences for consumers, delivery people, and merchants across the country,\u201d said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi in a statement.\n  \u201cOver the past eight years we have been focused on a single mission: enable anyone to have anything delivered to them on-demand. Joining forces with Uber will continue that mission as we continue to build Postmates while creating an even stronger platform that brings this mission to life for our customers. Uber and Postmates have been strong allies working together to advocate and create the best practices across our industry, especially for our couriers. Together we can ensure that as our industry continues to grow, it will do so for the benefit of everyone in the communities we serve,\u201d said Postmates co-founder and CEO Bastian Lehmann in his statement.\n Uber in its news announcement described Postmates as \u201chighly complementary\u201d to Uber Eats, citing the two companies\u2019 differing geographic focuses and target demographics and noting that Postmates has strong relationships with small- and medium-sized restaurants and other businesses that are loyal to the Postmates brand, which covers not only food but delivery of other items, too.\n On the other hand, Uber noted that together they\u2019ll build better tools and technology for their merchant and restaurant partners, and that these will have a wider user base now to tap. That last point somewhat contradicts the lack of overlap between the two so we\u2019ll have to see how that actually plays out.\n The all-stock deal valuation that Uber is paying out is a slight bump on Postmates\u2019 last valuation of\u00a0 $2.4 billion, which it reached in September 2019 on the back of a private equity round (it had raised just over $900 million in total over 10 years). But with the \u2018money\u2019 all in paper, it puts a lot of pressure both on Postmates and Uber to continue to deliver on growth \u2014 pun intended.\n For Uber, Uber Eats has been  one good news story\u00a0amid what has otherwise been a very tough life as a publicly listed company. That predicament has taken on a more critical edge in recent months through the COVID-19 pandemic.\n In its last quarterly earnings results, the Uber Eats business grew 52% and managed to somewhat offset a big decline in its ride-hailing revenues. In both cases, you can draw a line from the results to social distancing requirements that people have been following around the world: consumers have been staying home more and ordering take-out food to be delivered to them; and at the same time they have been staying away from shared, small spaces, such the ones that you might encounter in an Uber ride. However, with the boost at Uber Eats, the company lost $3 billion last quarter.\n The trend of those numbers is one reason why Uber has been looking to expand its food delivery business. The other is the one that has been motivating the larger consolidation trend in food delivery, and that is the principle of economies of scale and how that plays out in terms of operational expenditures, with single drivers able to cover more restaurants and orders, and also the costs of operating the business.\n The wider business model requires a lot of subsidising to grow, so taking out a competitor somewhat reduces that kind of costly competitive pressure. It doesn\u2019t eradicate it completely, though: DoorDash, Grubhub (now supercharged with Just Eat Takeaway profits and financial muscle) are still around and will represent strong alternatives both for consumers and restaurants looking for delivery partners.\n The public markets is a tough place to play out a growth story for a company that is still profoundly in the red like Uber. In that regard, it\u2019s an ironic place for Postmates to land.\n The latter had \u00a0 also been eyeing up a public listing, going so far as to  confidentially file for an IPO in February 2019. \u201cChoppy\u201d market forces got the better of it, however, and it  put off the plans. Although there were rumors even as recently as  last week that the company was still considering this option, in retrospect, that was quite possibly a report planted and spun by those hoping to hedge a better deal out of Uber.", "posttime": "2020-07-06 20:23:17", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u80a1\u7968,\u4ea4\u6613,\u8bc1\u5b9e,confirms,\u4f18\u6b65",

"note_en": "\u2026 in which we attempt to recreate a game from the nineties using the  Racket graphical facilities and we manage to do it in less than 1000 lines of code.\n  Instead of explaining the game, it is easier to show the game play. In the video below, the valid tiles are marked with their score, but this would be considered cheating in the actual game. The objective here, however, is to program the game, not to play it.\n By the way, if you are in a hurry, you can go directly to the  the source code for the game.\n    The game is played on a 8x12 board with 72 tiles. There are six colors and six images which combined produce 36 unique tiles. Two of each tile are combined to make the playing set. The objective of the game is to place all the tiles on the board with the following rules:\n a tile can be placed next to another one if either their color or image match. If there are multiple tiles around the tile, each neighbor must match either the color or the image.\n The game starts with the first six tiles already on the board, one in each corner and two in the middle. The tiles are selected such that each possible color and each possible image is present on the board, thus ensuring that the very first tile can be placed on the board.\n Scoring is done to reflect the complexity of the placement, with 1 point awarded if a tile is placed next to a single tile, 2 points for placing it against two tiles, 4 points for placing it against 3 neighbors and 8 points for placing it against 4.\n The game ends when either there are no more tiles to be placed on the board or there is no valid location on which to place a tile.\n  Given that this is an interactive game where the user needs to drag tiles on a board, the easiest way to implement this game is to use  snips and a  pasteboard. The  pasteboard% is one of the two editors provided by the Racket GUI framework and it will handle most of drag and drop functionality which the game requires. To use it, we will need to provide two classes:\n a  snip% class which represents a tile. A snip is an object which knows its size and how to draw itself. You can do cool things with snips, such as  rendering maps and even basic  GUI controls.\n  a  pasteboard% class which manages the snips (it can also draw things of its own). While we can use the  pasteboard% directly for testing purposes, we will need to define our own class to implement the restrictions imposed by the game.\n The game will also use the  racket/draw facilities for drawing directly to a device context. The draw functions provided by  snip% and  pasteboard% already use  dc&lt;%&gt; objects, and while we could have used the  pict library for rendering, for this simple case, it was thought unnecessary.\n  While the game board can be drawn using just lines, the game tiles will need six colors and six images, and it would help if these images would be nice ones, rather than using simply a circle, square and triangle shapes. The Unicode character set has lots of  emoji characters to choose from, and these are directly supported by Racket, which means that they can be stored in strings.\n In the game code, I choose to represent the unicode characters using the  \\U escape sequence followed by a code point, and during development using  display or the  text pict constructor to see the actual glyphs in the DrRacket REPL:\n  Choosing six colors can also be a difficult task if we want colors which look nice, are visually distinct and are also distinct for color-blind people. I don\u2019t know how to chose colors which meet all this criteria, so my preferred way is to find color schemes defined by others, in this case, one of  Paul Tol\u2019s Color Schemes, the \u201cbright qualitative\u201d one:\n   Rather than storing the drawing assets (color and glyph) in each tile object, a helper class can be used to manage the common functionality and assets for all snips. A theme class also allows changing the \u201ctheme\u201d, that is the colors and images at runtime \u2014 this is not implemented in this game, but could be added easily. Even without the ability to change themes, moving some common functionality in a separate class keeps the tile class simpler.\n In addition to managing the graphics assets for drawing, the theme class also provides the size of each tile (the  cell-width and  cell-height fields). These are calculated by the board itself when it is resized and communicated to the theme and from here used by all tiles in the game:\n (  define  theme%  (  class   object%  (  init-field  colors  glyphs )  (  super-new )  (  define  cell-width  100 )  (  define  cell-height  100 )  (  define  font  (  send  the-font-list  find-or-create-font  24  &#39; default  &#39; normal  &#39; normal ))  (  define/public  ( get-color  key )  (  vector-ref  colors  ( key-material  key )))  (  define/public  ( get-brush-for-material  key )  (  define  color  ( get-color  key ))  (  send  the-brush-list  find-or-create-brush  color  &#39; solid ))  (  define/public  ( get-glyph  key )  (  string  (  string-ref  glyphs  ( key-sigil  key ))))  (  define/public  ( get-font )  font )  (  define/public  ( get-text-foreground )  &#34;whitesmoke&#34; )  (  define/public  ( get-glyph-size  dc  key )  ;; ...  (  values  glyph-width  glyph-height ))  (  define/public  ( get-cell-size )  (  values  cell-width  cell-height ))  (  define/public  ( set-cell-size  w  h )  (  set!  cell-width  w )  (  set!  cell-height  h ))  ))\n  The tiles represent the objects that can be moved on the board and they are implemented using snips. Two things are needed to create a new snip: define a snip class (not to be confused with a racket  class%) and create a class derived from  snip% overriding the  get-extent and  draw methods.\n The snip class is used for serializing and de-serializing snip objects, but even though we don\u2019t use this functionality in the game, we still need to define one. The definition is identical for any snip class, except they need to have unique names. Note that the snip class is actually an instance of  snip-class% and not a class in itself:\n (  define  ishido-tile-snip-class  (  make-object  (  class  snip-class%  (  super-new )  (  send   this  set-classname  &#34;ishido-tile-snip&#34; )))) ;; Register our snip class with the system. (  send  ( get-the-snip-class-list )  add  ishido-tile-snip-class )\n We define our own  tile% class derived from the  snip% class. As far as the pasteboard is concerned, the new object needs to: (1) set the snip class for each instance (see the  set-snipclass call below, (2) define a  get-extent method which the pasteboard can use to determine the size of the snip and (3) define a draw method which is used to draw the snip.\n In addition to the snip interface, also has a  key a  theme and a  location. The  key is a structure which contains the color and glyph codes for the tile and the  theme is an object which holds the colors and glyphs used by the game (the tile class will ask the theme for the actual color to use corresponding to its key). The key and the theme are used for drawing the snip. Finally, the  location is a structure which holds the location of the tile on the board (column and row). It is not used by the tile class at all, but it the pasteboard will need to know the location of each tile, so might as well store it inside the tile object you can find the full definition in the  game source code.\n (  define  tile%  (  class  snip%  (  init-field  key  theme  [  location  #f ])  (  super-new )  (  send   this  set-snipclass  ishido-tile-snip-class )  (  define/public  ( get-location )   location )  (  define/public  ( set-location  l )  (  set!   location  l ))  (  define/public  ( get-key )  key )  (  define/override  ( get-extent  dc  x  y  w  h  descent  space  lspace  rspace )  ;; get-extent method implementation  )  (  define/override  ( draw  dc  x  y  .  other )  ;; draw method implementation  )  ))\n With the tile snip defined, we can write a quick test program to see how it works. Here we will use just a plain  pasteboard% which will display the snip and allow moving them around with the mouse. There are several objects which make up the \u201cgame\u201d:\n the  bq-colors, and  bird-glyphs define the colors and images to use for the tiles and they are managed by the  theme object\n    toplevel is the toplevel GUI window for the application, an instance of the  frame% class\n  canvas is the  editor-canvas% which acts as the view for the  pasteboard% (the pasteboard itself only manages snips, displaying is handled by one or more  editor-canvas% instances)\n The code also creates six tiles, one for each color and image and inserts them into the pasteboard.\n (  define  bq-colors  (  vector  ( make-color  68  119  170 )  ( make-color  102  204  238 )  ( make-color  34  136  51 )  ( make-color  204  187  68 )  ( make-color  238  102  119 )  ( make-color  170  51  119 ))) (  define  bird-glyphs  &#34; \\U1F99A\\U1F99C\\U1F9A9\\U1F989\\U1F986\\U1F985 &#34; ) (  define  theme  (  new  theme%  [ colors  bq-colors ]  [ glyphs  bird-glyphs ])) (  define  board  (  new  pasteboard% )) (  define  toplevel  (  new  frame%  [ label  &#34;Ishido&#34; ]  [ width  850 ]  [ height  600 ])) (  define  canvas  (  new  editor-canvas%  [ parent  toplevel ]  [ editor  board ])) (  for  ([ material  (  in-range  6 )]  [ sigil  (  in-range  6 )])  (  define  tile  (  new  tile%  [ key  ( key  material  sigil )]  [ theme  theme ]))  (  send  board  insert  tile )) (  send  toplevel  show  #t )\n The result is an interactive application, which allows dragging the snips around. The  pasteboard% provides a lot of functionality out of the box, but it still needs to be further customized to restrict its functionality according to the rules of the game (for example, snips should only be placed in precise positions on a board):\n   Having defined the tiles, we need to produce 72 of them, preferably in random order, so it they can be used in the game. To generate all the possible tiles, we can use nested for loops over the all the possible colors and images:\n (  define  all  (  for*/list  ([ group  (  in-range  2 )]  [ material  (  in-range  6 )]  [ sigil  (  in-range  6 )])  (  new  tile%  [ key  ( key  material  sigil )]  [ theme  theme ])))\n The previous list is ordered by color and image, and we need to shuffle it:\n  Finally, and this is the tricky bit, the first six tiles need to have unique colors and images. This is because the first six tiles are already on the board when the game starts and to ensure that the user can always place the next tile, all the colors and images need to be on the board. To achieve this, we loop over the shuffled tiles and move the first six unique tiles to the front. Doing this ensures that, while the first tiles are unique, they also start in a random order for each game.\n (  define  the-pouch  (  let  loop  ([ remaining  shuffled ]  [ head  &#39; ()]  ; contains unique material + sigil tiles  [ tail  &#39; ()]  ; contains all other tiles  ;; materials we haven&#39;t seen yet  [ materials  (  for/list  ([ x  (  in-range  6 )])  x )]  ;; sigils we haven&#39;t seen yet  [ sigils  (  for/list  ([ x  (  in-range  6 )])  x )])  (  cond  ((  null?  remaining )  (  append  head  tail ))  ((  and  (  null?  materials )  (  null?  sigils ))  ;; We have seen all materials and sigils  (  append  head  tail  remaining ))  ( #t  (  let  ([ candidate  (  car  remaining )])  (  match-define  ( key  material  sigil )  (  send  candidate  get-key ))  (  if  (  and  (  member  material  materials )  (  member  sigil  sigils ))  ( loop  (  cdr  remaining )  (  cons  candidate  head )  tail  (  remove  material  materials )  (  remove  sigil  sigils ))  ( loop  (  cdr  remaining )  head  (  cons  candidate  tail )  materials  sigils )))))))\n We can update our small test program to insert the contents of the pouch into the pasteboard and place them side by side \u2014 we used the  move-to method on the pasteboard to move the tiles next to each other, otherwise, they would just sit one on top of another. Note how the first six tiles have unique colors and images:\n (  define-values  ( cw  ch )  (  send  theme  get-cell-size )) (  for  ([( tile  index )  (  in-indexed  the-pouch )])  (  define-values  ( row  col )  (  quotient/remainder  index  12 ))  (  send  board  insert  tile )  (  send  board  move-to  tile  (  *  col  cw )  (  *  row  ch )))\n   The  pasteboard% object can manage tile snips and offers \u201cdragging\u201d functionality for free, but it allows too much freedom when it comes to moving tiles around. We\u2019ll need to implement our own board class, derived from  pasteboard% and adapting it so it is suitable as a Ishido game board. From a high level perspective, the board needs to implement the following:\n draw additional \u201cthings\u201d, such as the game score and the \u201cgame over\u201d message, plus the \u201cassistants\u201d such as the score for each valid cell.\n    allow dragging a tile from the \u201cnext tile\u201d square onto a valid location only, according to game rules\n  manage the tiles in the game, the ones which are on the board and the ones which are in the pouch.\n The pasteboard is the most complex part of the game, and, when counting lines of code, it is half of the program, but it all starts with deriving from  pasteboard%:\n   Rather than having static board dimensions, it is best to write GUI applications such that they make efficient use of the available space. All drawing and position calculations will be done based on knowing where the board is, and the  on-display-size method will calculate these positions. The  on-display-size is automatically called by the system to inform the pasteboard that its size has changed, usually in response to changing the size of the canvas which displays the pasteboard.\n Before we implement this class method, we need to define the fields which hold the positions and dimensions for the board and the \u201cnext tile\u201d square, and the role of  on-display-size is to calculate values for these fields based on the canvas dimensions:\n (  define  board%  (  class  pasteboard%  (  init-field  theme )  (  super-new )  (  define-values  ( board-x  board-y  board-width  board-height )  (  values  0  0  0  0 ))  (  define-values  ( next-tile-x  next-tile-y  next-tile-width  next-tile-height )  (  values  0  0  0  0 ))  (  define/augride  ( on-display-size )  ;; ...  )  ))\n Calculating the board position and dimensions is not particularly difficult, they are rectangles after all, but there are a few caveats:\n a pasteboard can be displayed in more than one canvas and each canvas can have different dimensions, so we cannot talk about the dimensions of the pasteboard itself. Still, the most common use case is to have a single canvas displaying the pasteboard, so we can just get that canvas and query its dimensions, this will do fine for this game.\n  an editor canvas has an \u201cinset\u201d which is an internal border around the canvas, this default to 5 drawing units. Drawing cannot be done in this inset area, and all calculations need to take this into account (an alternative is to create the  editor-canvas% with a horizontal and vertical inset of 0).\n  the lines drawn by the  racket/draw library have a width, and the actual line is drawn centered on the ideal direction given by the drawing coordinates. Since the drawing region is clipped around the valid drawing area, drawing the line right on the edge of the area will result in half of the line being outside, appearing as if the line is thinner. To account for this, the code uses an  internal-border to slightly reduce the available drawing area, so lines along the edge are drawn at full width.\n  some if the drawing APIs use a  box to obtain \u201coutput\u201d values. For example, the  get-view method will return the values in boxes which need to be defined before the call, rather than returning four values.\n (  define/augride  ( on-display-size )  (  define  admin  (  send   this  get-admin ))  (  define  canvas  (  send   this  get-canvas ))  (  define  internal-border  2 )  (  when  (  and  admin  canvas )  (  let  (( x  (  box  0 ))  ( y  (  box  0 ))  ( w  (  box  0 ))  ( h  (  box  0 )))  (  send  admin  get-view  x  y  w  h  #f )  ;; NOTE: the x, y coordinates of the board need to be adjusted for  ;; the editor canvas inset, but the width and the height do not.  (  set!  board-x  (  +  internal-border  (  unbox  x )))  (  set!  board-y  (  +  internal-border  (  unbox  y )))  (  set!  board-width  (  -  (  *  0.8  (  unbox  w ))  internal-border  internal-border ))  (  set!  board-height  (  -  (  *  1.0  (  unbox  h ))  internal-border  internal-border ))  (  define-values  ( cell-width  cell-height )  (  values  (  /  board-width  board-columns )  (  /  board-height  board-rows )))  (  set!  next-tile-width  (  *  1.7  cell-width ))  (  set!  next-tile-height  (  *  1.7  cell-height ))  (  set!  next-tile-x  (  +  board-x  board-width  (  /  (  -  (  unbox  w )  board-x  board-width  internal-border  next-tile-width )  2 )))  (  set!  next-tile-y  (  +  (  unbox  y )  internal-border ))  (  send  theme  set-cell-size  cell-width  cell-height )  ( refresh-all-snips ))))\n With the size calculations complete, we need to inform all snips and the canvas that the dimensions have changed: we set the cell width and height in the theme than call  refresh-all-snips since they will need to be updated. The  pasteboard% does not provide a simple interface to obtain all the snips, instead the snips are stored in a linked list: the first snip is obtained using  find-first-snip, than next ones are obtained by calling  next. The  refresh-all-snips will inform the snip administrator that the snip needs to be resized and it also calls  place-tile-on-board, since the position of the snip might have changed too. Also note that the entire block is wrapped inside a  begin-edit-sequence/ end-edit-sequence call. Normally, as each snip is updated, a redraw operation is queued immediately, and since we have to update many snips, this will result in a lot of redraws. The calls to begin and end edit sequence ensure that redraw requests are postponed until a block of operations is completed, and a single redraw takes place at the end of the call:\n (  define/private  ( refresh-all-snips )  (  send   this  begin-edit-sequence )  (  let  loop  ([ snip  (  send   this  find-first-snip )])  (  when  snip  (  define  admin  (  send  snip  get-admin ))  (  send  admin  resized  snip  #t )  ( place-tile-on-board  snip )  ( loop  (  send  snip  next ))))  (  send   this  end-edit-sequence ))\n The  place-tile-on-board method is a helper which positions a tile on the board according to its location, if the tile has one, or places it in the \u201cnext tile\u201d space if it does not have a location. The function simply calls  location-&gt;xy to determine the coordinates for a location and moves the tile by calling  move-to:\n (  define/private  ( place-tile-on-board  tile )  (  define-values  ( cell-width  cell-height )  (  send  theme  get-cell-size ))  (  if  (  send  tile  get-location )  (  let-values  ([( x  y )  ( location-&gt;xy  (  send  tile  get-location ))])  (  send   this  move-to  tile  x  y ))  (  send   this  move-to  tile  (  +  next-tile-x  (  /  (  -  next-tile-width  cell-width )  2 ))  (  +  next-tile-y  (  /  (  -  next-tile-height  cell-height )  2 )))))\n location-&gt;xy is a simple function which just multiplies the row and column of a location with the cell width and height:\n (  define/private  ( location-&gt;xy  l )  (  define-values  ( cell-width  cell-height )  (  send  theme  get-cell-size ))  (  match-define  (  location  column  row )  l )  (  values  (  +  board-x  (  *  cell-width  column ))  (  +  board-y  (  *  cell-height  row ))))\n We have not covered the drawing of the board itself, but here is a demo of how it all works. Since the sizes are all dynamically calculated, the board is drawn such that it fills up the available area while the tiles are resized to fit the squares o\n......", "posttime": "2020-07-06

"note_en": "I&#39;ve created a new batch of certificates that violate 4.9.9 of the BRs,which was introduced with the first version of the Baseline Requirements asa MUST. This is  https://misissued.com/batch/138/\n A quick inspection among the affected CAs include O fields of: QuoVadis,GlobalSign, Digicert, HARICA, Certinomis, AS Sertifitseeimiskeskus,Actalis, Atos, AC Camerfirma, SECOM, T-Systems, WISeKey, SCEE, and CNNIC.Section 4.9.9 of the BRs requires that OCSP Delegated Responders MUSTinclude an id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck extension. RFC 6960 defines an OCSPDelegated Responder within Section 4.2.2.2 as indicated by the presence ofthe id-kp-OCSPSigning as an EKU.These certificates lack the necessary extension, and as such, violate theBRs. As the vast majority of these were issued on-or-after 2013-02-01, theEffective Date of Mozilla Root CA Policy v2.1, these are misissued. Youcould also consider the effective date as 2013-05-15, described later in[1] , without changing the results.This batch is NOT comprehensive. According to crt.sh, there areapproximately 293 certificates that meet the criteria of &#34;issued by aMozilla-trusted, TLS-capable CA, with the OCSPSigning EKU, and withoutpkix-nocheck&#34;. misissued.com had some issues with parsing some of thesecertificates, due to other non-conformities, so I only included a sample.Censys.io is aware of approximately 276 certificates that meet thiscriteria, as you can see at [2]. The differences in perspectivesunderscores the importance of CAs needing to carefully examine thecertificates they&#39;ve issued to understand.It&#39;s important for CAs to understand this is Security Relevant. While theyshould proceed with revoking these CAs within seven (7) days, as definedunder the Baseline Requirements Section 4.9.1.2, the degree of this issuelikely also justifies requiring witnessed Key Destruction Reports, in orderto preserve the integrity of the issuer of these certificates (which mayinclude the CA&#39;s root).The reason for this is simple: In every case I examined, these arecertificates that appear to nominally be intended as Issuing CAs, not asOCSP Responder Certificates. It would appear that many CAs were unfamiliarwith RFC 6960 when constructing their certificate profiles, and similarlyignored discussion of this issue in the past [3], which highlighted thesecurity impact of this. I&#39;ve flagged this as a SECURITY matter for CAs tocarefully review, because in the cases where a third-party, other than theIssuing CA, operates such a certificate, the Issuing CA has delegated theability to mint arbitrary OCSP responses to this third-party!For example, consider a certificate like  https://crt.sh/?id=2657658699 .This certificate, from HARICA, meets Mozilla&#39;s definition of &#34;TechnicallyConstrained&#34; for TLS, in that it lacks the id-kp-serverAuth EKU. However,because it includes the OCSP Signing EKU, this certificate can be used tosign arbitrary OCSP messages for HARICA&#39;s Root!This also applies to non-technically-constrained sub-CAs. For example,consider this certificate  https://crt.sh/?id=21606064 . It was issued byDigiCert to Microsoft, granting Microsoft the ability to provide OCSPresponses for any certificate issued by Digicert&#39;s Baltimore CyberTrustRoot. We know from DigiCert&#39;s disclosures that this is independentlyoperated by Microsoft.Unfortunately, revocation of this certificate is simply not enough toprotect Mozilla TLS users. This is because this Sub-CA COULD provide OCSPfor itself that would successfully validate, AND provide OCSP for otherrevoked sub-CAs, even if it was revoked. That is, if this Sub-CA&#39;s key wasmaliciously used to sign a GOOD response for itself, it would be accepted.These security concerns are discussed in Section 4.2.2.2.1 of RFC 6960, andis tied to a reliance on the CRL. Mozilla users COULD be protected throughthe use of OneCRL, although this would not protect other PKI participantsor use cases that don&#39;t use OneCRL.A little more than a third of the affected certificates have already beenrevoked, which is encouraging. However, I&#39;m not aware of any incidentreports discussing this failure, nor am I aware of any key destructionreports to provide assurance that these keys cannot be used maliciously.While this seems like a benign failure of &#34;we used the wrong profile&#34;, ithas a meaningful security impact to end users, even if it was made with thebest of intentions.This has been a requirement of the BRs since the first version, and isspelled out within the OCSP RFCs, and CAs are expected to be deeplyknowledgeable in both of these areas. There is no excusing such anoversight, especially if it was (most likely) to work around an issue witha particular CA Software Vendor&#39;s product. Recall that the samejustification (work around an issue in a vendor&#39;s product) has been used tojustify MITM interception. Ignorance and malice are, unfortunately, oftenindistinguishable, and thus have to be treated the same.While I&#39;ll be looking to create Compliance Incidents for the affected CAs,and attempting to report through their problem reporting mechanisms, thefact that it is the constrained CAs which are not yet required to bedisclosed, and most likely invisible to CT (e.g. S/MIME issuing CAs that donot issue TLS), still pose substantial risk, that it requires every CAclosely examine their practices.CAs affected MUST ensure they revoke such certificates within 7 days, asper 4.9.1.2 (5) and 4.9.1.2

"note_en": "Previous investors, including Tiger Global, Y Combinator and ACE &amp; Company, also returned for the round. New investors include Indonesian Bank BRI. Payfazz\u2019s last round of funding was a $21 million Series A announced in September 2018, led by Tiger Global. Its total raised to date is now more than $74 million.\n There is a growing list of Indonesian financial tech startups, including Modalku, KoinWorks and Kredivo, that focus on consumer and small business financing, while larger and more diversified tech companies like Gojek and Grab are working their own online payment tools and other services. Payfazz differentiates with a portfolio of mobile services that make it easier for Indonesians to handle routine financial tasks, including bill payments and loans, even if they live in rural areas without banks. The company says it currently serves 10 million monthly active users, and plans to expand its offerings to include more digital financial products.\n  Founded in 2016 by Hendra Kwik, Jefriyanto and Ricky Winata, Payfazz is an alum of Y Combinator\u2019s accelerator program.\n The company uses a network of financial agents to reach customers because many banks don\u2019t open branches in rural areas, Kwik told TechCrunch. \u201cDue to high fixed costs, traditional banks find it economical to operate only in cities and urban areas with high density and foot traffic,\u201d he said. \u201cThis leaves a huge unfulfilled and underserved banking need in rural areas where banking access is very difficult.\u201d\n Payfazz\u2019s network currently includes about 250,000 agents, most of whom are located in small stores. Users deposit cash with the agents, who serve as go-betweens with banks. This allows Payfazz\u2019s users to have a balance they can use to pay phone, electricity and other bills. Payfazz also recently launched loans and payments for offline retailers.\n Kwik said Payfazz built an agent network because even though smartphone penetration is high in Indonesia, many people haven\u2019t used direct digital banking services before, so talking to a Payfazz agent helps familiarize them with the process. Since most of its agents are based out of warung or kirana stores, or neighborhood shops that sell food and other necessities, they are easier for people in rural areas and small towns to access than banks, ATM machines or convenience store chains.\n \u201cOur agents are small businesses and people who have lots of traffic from rural areas\u2019 populations in their places. It can be warung and kirana stores, telco stores, small restaurants or even someone\u2019s house,\u201d Kwik said. \u201cThey are the perfect profile to become our agents because they\u2019re ubiquitously distributed and have high coverage in rural areas.\u201d\n He added that Payfazz also gives agents an opportunity to earn extra income. Payfazz takes a 0.5% to 1% commission on every transaction, and agents are allowed to set the margins they charge customers for transactions, usually between 5% to 9%. Before signing on an agent, Payfazz screens them using KYC (\u201cknow your customer\u201d) and verification technology to gauge trustiworthiness, traffic and sales potential.\n While Grab Financial and other Southeast Asian fintech companies may eventually become Payfazz\u2019s competitors, Kwik said he currently sees them as potential partners.\n \u201cThe reason is simply because most of these providers still focus their market and resources in the cities and urban areas, like many of the traditional banks. Meanwhile Payfazz focuses all its market and resources in rural areas,\u201d he added. \u201cPayfazz can help other banks and financial service providers to expand their reach to rural areas and capture hundreds of millions of users and billions of dollars of revenue opportunity there.\u201d\n In a statement about the funding, Insignia Ventures founding managing partner Yinglan Tan said \u201cWe have been privileged to have supported Payfazz since their early days. We believe that this path to taking their fintech ecosystem from Indonesia to the rest of the region will meet the pressing needs of many more of Southeast Asia\u2019s digital consumers, and are excited to see how Hendra and the Payfazz team will build on top of the portfolio of services that millions of Indonesians are already using.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-07-06 20:02:23", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u83b7\u5f97,give,payfazz", "title": "\nPayfazz\u83b7\u5f975300\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u8ba9\u66f4\u591a\u5370\u5c3c\u4eba\u83b7\u5f97\u91d1\u878d\u670d\u52a1", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tPayfazz gets $53 million to give more Indonesians access to financial services\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/payfazz-gets-53-million-to-give-more-indonesians-access-to-financial-services/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u83b7\u5f97", "give", "payfazz"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1010103, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8bf7\u8003\u8651\u8ba2\u9605LWN\u8ba2\u9605\u662fLWN.net\u7684\u547d\u8109\u3002\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u6b23\u8d4f\u6b64\u5185\u5bb9\u5e76\u5e0c\u671b\u770b\u5230\u66f4\u591a\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u60a8\u7684\u8ba2\u9605\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u786e\u4fddLWN\u7ee7\u7eed\u84ec\u52c3\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u8bf7\u8bbf\u95ee\u672c\u9875\u52a0\u5165\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301LWN\u5728\u7f51\u4e0a\u3002\n\u4e0b\u6b21\u5f53\u4f60\u7684Linux\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\u5d29\u6e83\u65f6\uff0c\u62ff\u51fa\u4f60\u7684\u624b\u8868(\u6216\u4f60\u7684\u624b\u673a)\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e00\u4e0b\u542f\u52a8\u9700\u8981\u591a\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u66f4\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u60a8\u6b63\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e5\u5fd7\u6587\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u60a8\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u4ec5\u542f\u52a8\u5f97\u5f88\u5feb\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6ca1\u6709\u4e22\u5931\u60a8\u5173\u5fc3\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u6570\u636e\u3002(\u53ef\u80fd\u60a8\u4e22\u5931\u4e86DHCP\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u65e5\u5fd7\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u6700\u540e\u51e0\u4e2a\u5b57\u8282\uff0c\u8be5\u6b7b\u7684\u3002)\u3002\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u5c06\u60a8\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8ba1\u65f6\u8bbe\u5907\u653e\u5728\u624b\u8fb9\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u6b63\u5e38\u5173\u673a\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u542f\u52a8\u3002\u66f4\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4f60\u4f1a\u53d1\u73b0\u91cd\u65b0\u542f\u52a8\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u7cfb\u7edf\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u6062\u590d\u82b1\u8d39\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4-\u800c\u4e14\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684\u597d\u5904\u3002\u4e54\u6cbb\u00b7\u574e\u8fea\u4e9a(George Candea)\u548c\u963f\u66fc\u591a\u00b7\u798f\u514b\u65af(Armando Fox)\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\uff0c\u4e0e\u76f4\u89c9\u76f8\u53cd\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u6062\u590d\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u91cd\u542f\u66f4\u5feb\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u300aCrash-Only Software\u300b\u4e2d\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c", "note_en": "Please consider subscribing to LWN Subscriptions are the lifeblood of LWN.net.

"note_en": "Technology firm Fujitsu has said it will halve its office space in Japan as it adapts to the &#34;new normal&#34; of the coronavirus pandemic.\n It says the &#34;Work Life Shift&#34; programme will offer unprecedented flexibility to its 80,000 workers in the country.\n Staff will be able to work flexible hours, and working from home will be standard wherever possible.\n  In  a statement sent to the BBC, Fujitsu said it &#34;will introduce a new way of working that promises a more empowering, productive, and creative experience for employees that will boost innovation and deliver new value to its customers and society&#34;.\n  Under the plan employees will &#34;begin to primarily work on a remote-basis to achieve a working style that allows them to flexibly use their time according to the contents of their work, business roles, and lifestyle&#34;.\n The company also said that the programme will allow staff to choose where they work, whether that is from home, a major corporate hub or a satellite office.\n Fujitsu believes that that the increased autonomy offered to its workers will help to improve the performance of teams and increase productivity.\n Sree Sreenivasan, a Marshall Loeb Visiting Professor of Digital Innovation at the Stony Brook University School of Journalism, said the announcement underlines the huge long-term impact of the pandemic on the way many of us work.\n &#34;This is yet another sign that everything we know about offices and the future of work is being upended. Thousands of employers and millions of employees are learning the pros and cons of the new normal.&#34;\n &#34;If they can combine the best of the pros (less commuting, more productivity, less expenses, etc), while minimising the cons (lack of in-person bonding, never being off the clock, etc), millions will be grateful, while frustrating thousands who preferred the old way of life,&#34; he added.\n  In May, Twitter told staff that they can work from home &#34;forever&#34; if they wish as the company looks towards the future after the coronavirus pandemic.\n The social media platform said: &#34;The past few months have proven we can make that work. So if our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work from home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen.&#34;\n Earlier that month Google and Facebook said their staff can work from home until the end of the year.\n Google originally said it would keep its work from home policy until 1 June, but extended it for seven more months.", "posttime":

"note_en": "No. It just means that Lean\u2019s  / symbol doesn\u2019t mean mathematical division. Let   denote the real numbers. Let\u2019s define a function   by   if   and  . Does  making that definition give us a contradiction in mathematics? No, of course not! It\u2019s just a definition. Lean uses the symbol  / to mean  . As does Coq, Agda etc. Lean calls it  real.div by the way, not  .\n  It certainly seems to lead to confusion on Twitter. But it doesn\u2019t lead to confusion when doing mathematics in a theorem prover. Mathematicians  don\u2019t divide by 0 and hence in practice they never notice the difference between  real.div and mathematical division (for which  1/0 is undefined). Indeed, if a mathematician is asking what Lean thinks  1/0 is, one might ask the mathematician  why they are even asking, because as we all know, dividing by 0 is not allowed in mathematics, and hence this cannot be relevant to their work. In fact knowing  real.div is the same as knowing mathematical division; any theorem about one translates into a theorem about the other, so having  real.div is equivalent to having mathematical division.\n  It gets worse. There\u2019s a subtraction  nat.sub defined on the natural numbers  , with notation  x - y, and it eats two natural numbers and spits out another natural number. If  x and  y are terms of type  \u2115 and  x &lt; y, then  x - y will be 0. There\u2019s a function called  real.sqrt which takes as input a real number, and outputs a real number. If you give it  , it outputs  . I don\u2019t know what happens if you give it the input  , beyond the fact that it is guaranteed to output a real number. Maybe it\u2019s 0. Maybe it\u2019s 1. Maybe it\u2019s 37. I don\u2019t care. I am a mathematician, and if I want to take the square root of a negative real number, I won\u2019t use  real.sqrt because I don\u2019t want an answer in the reals, and the type of  real.sqrt is  \u211d \u2192 \u211d.\n  Great question! I tried this in 2017! Turns out it\u2019s  really inconvenient in a theorem prover!\n Here\u2019s how I learnt Lean. I came at it as a \u201cnormal mathematician\u201d, who was thinking about integrating Lean into their undergraduate introduction to proof course. I had no prior experience with theorem provers, and no formal background in programming. As a feasibility study, I tried to use Lean to do all the problem sheets which I was planning on giving the undergraduates. This was back in 2017 when Lean\u2019s maths library was much smaller, and  real.sqrt did not yet exist. However the basic theory of sups and infs had been formalised, so I defined  real.sqrt x, for  x non-negative, to be  , and proved the basic theorems that one would want in an interface for a square root function, such as   and   and   and so on (here   are non-negative reals, the only reals which my function would accept).\n I then set out to prove  , a question on a problem sheet from my course. The students are told not to use a calculator, and asked to find a proof which only uses algebraic manipulations, i.e. the interface for  real.sqrt. Of course, the way I had set things up,  every time I used the   symbol I had to supply a proof that what I was taking the square root of was non-negative. Every time the symbol occurred in my proof. Even if I had proved  2 &gt; 0 on the previous line, I had to prove it again on this line, because this line also had a   in. Of course the proof is just  by norm_num, but that was 10 characters which I soon got sick of typing.\n I then moaned about this on the Lean chat, was mocked for my silly mathematician conventions, and shown the idiomatic Lean way to do it. The idiomatic way to do it is to allow garbage inputs like negative numbers into your square root function, and return garbage outputs. It is in the  theorems where one puts the non-negativity hypotheses. For example, the statement of the theorem that   has the hypotheses that  . Note that it does  not also have the hypothesis that  , as one can deduce this within the proof and not bother the user with it. This is in contrast to the mathematicians\u2019 approach, where the proof that   would also need to be supplied because it is in some sense part of the   notation.\n  No, not really. I\u2019m saying that it is (a)  mathematically equivalent to what we mathematicians currently do and (b) simply  more convenient when formalising mathematics in dependent type theory.\n What actually is a field anyway? For a mathematician, a field is a set   equipped with   where the inversion function   is only defined for non-zero  . The non-zero elements of a field form a group, so we have axioms such as   for   (and this doesn\u2019t even make sense for  ). Let\u2019s say we encountered an alien species, who had also discovered fields, but their set-up involved a function   instead of our  . Their   was defined, using our notation, by   for  , and  . Their axioms are of course just the same as ours, for example they have   for  . They have an extra axiom  , but this is no big deal. It\u2019s swings and roundabouts \u2014 they define   and their theorem   doesn\u2019t require  , whereas ours does. They are simply using slightly different notation to express the same idea. Their   is discontinuous. Ours is not defined everywhere. But there is a  canonical isomorphism of categories between our category of fields and theirs. There is  no difference mathematically between the two set-ups.\n Lean uses the alien species convention. The aliens\u2019   is Lean\u2019s  field.inv , and Lean\u2019s  field.div x y is defined to be  field.mul (x, field.inv y).\n OK so I can see that it can be made to work. Why do I still feel a bit uncomfortable about all this?\n It\u2019s probably for the following reason. You are imagining that a computer proof checker will be checking your work, and in particular checking to see if you ever divided by zero, and if you did then you expect it to throw an error saying that your proof is invalid. What you need to internalise is that Lean is just using that function   above, defined by   for   and  . In particular you cannot prove false things by applying   to an input of the form  , because the way to get a contradiction by dividing by zero and then continuing will involve invoking theorems which are true for mathematical division but which are not true for  . For example perhaps a mathematician would say   is true for all  , with the implicit assumption that   and that this can be inferred from the notation. Lean\u2019s theorem that  real.div a a = 1 is only proved under the assumption that  , so the theorem cannot be invoked if  . In other words, the problem simply shows up at a different point in the argument. Lean won\u2019t accept your proof of   which sneakily divides by 0 on line 8, but the failure will occur at a different point in the argument. The failure  will still however be the assertion that you have a denominator which you have not proved is nonzero. It will simply not occur at the point when you do the division, it will occur at the point where you invoke the theorem which is not true for  real.div.\n Thanks to Jim Propp and Alex Kontorovich for bringing this up on Twitter. I hope that this clarifies things.\n    This entry was posted in  Learning Lean,  M1F,  M40001,  Type theory,  undergrad maths and tagged  division,  division by zero.

"note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  Henrietta Lacks (born  Loretta Pleasant; August 1, 1920 \u2013 October 4, 1951)  [2] was an African-American woman  [3] whose cancer cells are the source of the  HeLa cell line, the first  immortalized human cell line  [4] and one of the most important cell lines in medical research. An immortalized cell line reproduces indefinitely under specific conditions, and the HeLa cell line continues to be a source of invaluable medical data to the present day.  [5]\n Lacks was the unwitting source of these cells from a tumor  biopsied during treatment for  cervical cancer at  Johns Hopkins Hospital in  Baltimore, Maryland, U.S., in 1951. These cells were then  cultured by  George Otto Gey who created the cell line known as HeLa, which is still used for  medical research.  [6] As was then the practice, no consent was obtained to culture her cells, nor were she or her family compensated for their extraction or use.\n Lacks grew up in rural Virginia. After giving birth to two of their children, she married her cousin David &#34;Day&#34; Lacks. In 1941 the young family moved to Turner Station, near  Dundalk, Maryland, in  Baltimore County, so Day could work in  Bethlehem Steel at  Sparrows Point. After Lacks had given birth to their fifth child, Joseph, she was diagnosed with cancer.  [7] Tissue samples from her tumors were taken without consent during treatment and these samples were then subsequently cultured into the HeLa cell line.\n Even though some information about the origins of HeLa&#39;s immortalized cell lines was known to researchers after 1970, the Lacks family was not made aware of the line&#39;s existence until 1975. With knowledge of the cell line&#39;s genetic provenance becoming public, its use for medical research and for commercial purposes continues to raise concerns about privacy and patients&#39; rights.\n   Henrietta Lacks was born Loretta Pleasant on August 1, 1920,  [2]  [8] in  Roanoke, Virginia, to Eliza and Johnny Pleasant.  [9] Her family is uncertain how her name changed from Loretta to Henrietta, but she was nicknamed Hennie.  [2] When Lacks was four years old in 1924, her mother died giving birth to her tenth child.  [9] Unable to care for the children alone after his wife&#39;s death, Lacks&#39; father moved the family to  Clover, Virginia, where the children were distributed among relatives. Lacks ended up with her grandfather, Tommy Lacks, in a two-story log cabin that was once the slave quarters on the plantation that had been owned by Henrietta&#39;s white great-grandfather and great-uncle.  [2] She shared a room with her nine-year-old cousin and future husband, David &#34;Day&#34; Lacks (1915\u20132002).  [9]\n Like most members of her family living in Clover, Lacks worked as a tobacco farmer starting from an early age. In 1935, when Lacks was 14 years old, she gave birth to a son, Lawrence Lacks. In 1939, her daughter Elsie Lacks (1939\u20131955) was born. Both children were fathered by Day Lacks. Elsie Lacks had  developmental disabilities and was described by the family as &#34;different&#34; or &#34;deaf and dumb&#34;.  [2]\n On April 10, 1941, Day and Henrietta Lacks were married in  Halifax County, Virginia.  [2] Later that year, their cousin, Fred Garrett, convinced the couple to leave the tobacco farm in Virginia and move to Maryland where Day Lacks could work at Bethlehem Steel in Sparrow&#39;s Point. Not long after they moved to Maryland, Garrett was called to fight in  World War II. With the savings gifted to him by Garrett, Day Lacks was able to purchase a house at 713 New Pittsburgh Avenue in Turner Station. Now part of Dundalk, Turner Station was one of the oldest and largest African-American communities in Baltimore County at that time.  [10]  [11]\n Living in Maryland, Henrietta and Day Lacks had three more children: David &#34;Sonny&#34; Lacks Jr. (b. 1947), Deborah Lacks Pullum (born Deborah Lacks; 1949\u20132009), and Joseph Lacks (1950). Henrietta gave birth to her last child at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore in November 1950, four and a half months before she was diagnosed with cervical cancer.  [2] Around the same time, Elsie Lacks (Henrietta and Day&#39;s daughter born in 1939), was placed in the Hospital for the Negro Insane, later renamed  Crownsville Hospital Center, where Elsie died in 1955 at the age of 15 years old.  [2]\n   On January 29, 1951, Lacks went to Johns Hopkins, the only hospital in the area that treated black patients, because she felt a &#34;knot&#34; in her womb.  [12] She had previously told her cousins about the &#34;knot&#34; and they assumed correctly that she was pregnant. But after giving birth, Lacks had a severe  hemorrhage. Her primary care doctor tested her for  syphilis, which came back negative, and referred her back to Johns Hopkins. There, her doctor,  Howard W. Jones, took a  biopsy of a mass found on Lacks&#39;  cervix for laboratory testing. Soon after, Lacks was told that she had a malignant  epidermoid carcinoma of the cervix.  [a]  [14] In 1970, physicians discovered that she had been misdiagnosed and actually had an  adenocarcinoma.  [b] This was a common mistake at the time and the treatment would not have differed.  [16]\n Lacks was treated with  radium tube inserts as an inpatient and discharged a few days later with instructions to return for X-ray treatments as a follow-up. During her treatments, two samples were taken from Lacks&#39; cervix without her permission or knowledge; one sample was of healthy tissue and the other was cancerous.  [17] These samples were given to  George Otto Gey, a physician and cancer researcher at Johns Hopkins. The cells from the cancerous sample eventually became known as the  HeLa  immortal cell line, a commonly used  cell line in contemporary  biomedical research.  [2]\n  On August 8, 1951, Lacks, who was 31 years old, went to Johns Hopkins for a routine treatment session and asked to be admitted due to continued severe abdominal pain. She received blood transfusions and remained at the hospital until her death on October 4, 1951.  [18] A partial  autopsy showed that the cancer had  metastasized throughout her entire body.  [2]  [19]\n  Lacks was buried in an unmarked grave in the family cemetery in a place called Lackstown in Halifax County, Virginia. Lackstown is the name that was given to the land in Clover, Virginia, that was originally owned by slave-owning members of the Lacks family in the  antebellum South.\n Lacks&#39;s exact burial location is unknown, but the family believes that it is within a few feet of her mother&#39;s grave site, which for decades was the only one in the family to have been marked with a tombstone.  [2]  [19]  [20] In 2010,  Roland Pattillo, a faculty member of the  Morehouse School of Medicine who had worked with George Gey and knew the Lacks family,  [21] donated a headstone for Lacks.  [22] This prompted her family to raise money for a headstone for Elsie Lacks as well, which was dedicated on the same day.  [22] The headstone of Henrietta Lacks is shaped like a book and contains an epitaph written by her grandchildren that reads:  [2]\n  Henrietta Lacks, August 1, 1920 - October 4, 1951 \u00a0In loving memory of a phenomenal woman,  wife and mother who touched the lives of many. Here lies Henrietta Lacks (HeLa). Her immortal  \u00a0cells will continue to help mankind forever. Eternal Love and Admiration, From Your Family  [23]\n    George Otto Gey, the first researcher to study Lacks&#39;s cancerous cells, observed that her cells were unique in that they reproduced at a very high rate and could be kept alive long enough to allow more in-depth examination.  [24] Until then, cells cultured for laboratory studies survived for only a few days at most, which wasn&#39;t long enough to perform a variety of different tests on the same sample. Lacks&#39;s cells were the first to be observed that could be divided multiple times without dying, which is why they became known as &#34;immortal.&#34; After Lacks&#39; death, Gey had Mary Kubicek, his lab assistant, take further HeLa samples while Henrietta&#39;s body was at Johns Hopkins&#39; autopsy facility.  [25] The roller-tube technique  [c] was the method used to culture the cells obtained from the samples that Kubicek collected.  [27] Gey was able to start a cell line from Lacks&#39;s sample by isolating one specific cell and repeatedly dividing it, meaning that the same cell could then be used for conducting many experiments. They became known as HeLa cells, because Gey&#39;s standard method for labeling samples was to use the first two letters of the patient&#39;s first and last names.  [2]\n The ability to rapidly reproduce HeLa cells in a laboratory setting has led to many important breakthroughs in biomedical research. For example, by 1954,  Jonas Salk was using HeLa cells in his research to develop the  polio vaccine.  [19] To test his new vaccine, the cells were mass-produced in the first-ever cell production factory.  [28] Additionally,  Chester M. Southam, a leading virologist, injected HeLa cells into cancer patients, prison inmates, and healthy individuals in order to observe whether cancer could be transmitted as well as to examine if one could become immune to cancer by developing an acquired immune response.  [29]\n HeLa cells were in high demand and put into mass production. They were mailed to scientists around the globe for &#34;research into  cancer,  AIDS, the effects of radiation and toxic substances,  gene mapping, and countless other scientific pursuits&#34;.  [19] HeLa cells were the first human cells successfully cloned in 1955,  [30] and have since been used to test human sensitivity to tape, glue, cosmetics, and many other products.  [2] Since the 1950s, scientists have grown as much as 50 million metric tons of her cells,  [31] and there are almost 11,000 patents involving HeLa cells.  [2]\n In the early 1970s, a large portion of other cell cultures became contaminated by HeLa cells. As a result, members of Henrietta Lacks&#39;s family received solicitations for blood samples from researchers hoping to learn about the family&#39;s genetics in order to differentiate between HeLa cells and other cell lines.   [33]\n Alarmed and confused, several family members began questioning why they were receiving so many telephone calls requesting blood samples. In 1975, the family also learned through a chance dinner-party conversation that material originating in Henrietta Lacks was continuing to be used for medical research.  [19] The family had never discussed Henrietta&#39;s illness and death among themselves in the intervening years but with the increased curiosity about their mother and her genetics, they now began to ask questions.  [2]\n  Neither Henrietta Lacks nor her family gave her physicians permission to harvest her cells. At that time, permission was neither required nor customarily sought.  [34] The cells were used in medical research and for commercial purposes.  [19]  [2] In the 1980s, family medical records were published without family consent. A similar issue was brought up in the  Supreme Court of California case of   Moore v. Regents of the University of California in 1990. The court ruled that a person&#39;s discarded tissue and cells are not their property and can be commercialized.  [35]\n In March 2013, researchers published the  DNA sequence of the  genome of a strain of HeLa cells. The Lacks family discovered this when the author  Rebecca Skloot informed them.  There were objections from the Lacks family about the genetic information that was available for public access. Jeri Lacks Whye, a grandchild of Henrietta Lacks, said to   The New York Times, &#34;the biggest concern was privacy - what information was actually going to be out there about our grandmother, and what information they can obtain from her sequencing that will tell them about her children and grandchildren and going down the line.&#34; That same year another group working on a different HeLa cell line&#39;s genome under  National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding submitted it for publication. In August 2013, an agreement was announced between the family and the NIH that gave the family some control over access to the cells&#39; DNA sequence found in the two studies along with a promise of acknowledgement in scientific papers. In addition, two family members will join the six-member committee which will regulate access to the sequence data.  [36]\n   In 1996,  Morehouse School of Medicine held its first annual HeLa Women&#39;s Health Conference. Led by physician  Roland Pattillo, the conference is held to give recognition to Henrietta Lacks, her cell line, and &#34;the valuable contribution made by African Americans to medical research and clinical practice&#34;.  [37]  [22]  [38] The mayor of Atlanta declared the date of the first conference, October 11, 1996, &#34;Henrietta Lacks Day&#34;.  [39]\n Lacks&#39;s contributions continue to be celebrated at yearly events in Turner Station.  [40]  [41] At one such event in 1997, then-U.S. Congressman from Maryland,  Robert Ehrlich, presented a congressional resolution recognizing Lacks and her contributions to medical science and research.  [42]\n In 2010, the Johns Hopkins Institute for Clinical and Translational Research established the annual Henrietta Lacks Memorial Lecture Series  [43] to honor Henrietta Lacks and the global impact of HeLa cells on medicine and research.  [44] During the 2018 lectures, the University announced the naming of a new building on the medical campus for Lacks.  [45]\n In 2011,  Morgan State University in Baltimore granted Lacks a posthumous honorary doctorate in public service.  [46] Also in 2011, the  Evergreen School District in  Vancouver, Washington, named their new high school focused on medical careers the  Henrietta Lacks Health and Bioscience High School, becoming the first organization to memorialize her publicly by naming a school in her honor.  [47]  [48]\n In 2014, Lacks was inducted into the  Maryland Women&#39;s Hall of Fame.  [49]  [50] In 2017, a  minor planet in the  main asteroid belt was named &#34; 359426 Lacks&#34; in her honor.  [51]  [52]\n In 2018 the   New York Times published a belated obituary for her   [53] as part of the Overlooked history project.  [54]  [55] Also in 2018, the  National Portrait Gallery and the  National Museum of African-American History and Culture jointly announced the accession of a portrait of Lacks by  Kadir Nelson.  [56]\n On October 6, 2018,  Johns Hopkins University announced plans to name a research building in honor of Lacks.  [57] The announcement was made at the 9th annual Henrietta Lacks Memorial Lecture in the Turner Auditorium in  East Baltimore by Johns Hopkins University President  Ronald J. Daniels and  Paul B. Rothman, CEO of  Johns Hopkins Medicine and dean of the medical faculty of the  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, surrounded by several of Lacks&#39; descendants. \u201cThrough her life and her immortal cells, Henrietta Lacks made an immeasurable impact on science and medicine that has touched countless lives around the world,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cThis building will stand as a testament to her transformative impact on scientific discovery and the ethics that must undergird its pursuit. We at Johns Hopkins are profoundly grateful to the Lacks family for their partnership as we continue to learn from Mrs. Lacks\u2019 life and to honor her enduring legacy.\u201d The building will adjoin the Berman Institute of Bioethics\u2019 Deering Hall, located at the corner of Ashland and Rutland Avenues and &#34;will support programs that enhance participation and partnership with members of the community in research that can benefit the community, as well as extend the opportunities to further study and promote research ethics and community engagement in research through an expansion of the Berman Institute and its work.&#34;  [57]\n  The question of how and whether her race affected her treatment, the lack of obtaining consent, and her relative obscurity, continues to be controversial.  [58]  [59]\n The HeLa cell line&#39;s connection to Henrietta Lacks was first brought to popular attention in March 1976 with a pair of articles in the   Detroit Free Press  [60] and   Rolling Stone written by reporter  Michael Rogers.  [61] In 1998,  Adam Curtis directed a  BBC documentary about Henrietta Lacks called  The Way of All Flesh.  [62]\n Rebecca Skloot documented extensive histories of both the HeLa cell line and the Lacks family in two articles published in 2000  [20] and 2001  [63] and in her 2010 book   The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.\n HBO announced in 2010 that  Oprah Winfrey and  Alan Ball were developing a  film project based on Skloot&#39;s book,  [22] and in 2016 filming commenced.  [64]  [65] with Winfrey in the leading role of Deborah Lacks, Henrietta&#39;s daughter.  [66]  [67] The film   The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks was released in 2017, with  Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry portraying Lacks.\n NBC&#39;s   Law &amp; Order aired its own fictionalized version of Lacks&#39;s story in the 2010 episode &#34;Immortal,&#34; which   Slate referred to as &#34;shockingly close to the true story&#34;  [68] and the musical groups  Jello Biafra and the Guantanamo School of Medicine and  Yeasayer both released songs about Henrietta Lacks and her legacy.  [69]  [70]\n Members of the Lacks family authored their own stories for the first time in 2013 when Lacks&#39;s oldest son and his wife, Lawrence and Bobbette Lacks, wrote a short digital memoir called &#34;Hela Family Stories: Lawrence and Bobbette&#34; with first-hand accounts of their memories of Henrietta Lacks while she was alive and of their own efforts to keep the youngest children out of unsafe living environments following their mother&#39;s death.  [71]\n The HeLa Project, a multimedia exhibition to honor Lacks, opened in 2017 in Baltimore at the  Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History &amp; Culture. It included a portrait by  Kadir Nelson and a poem by  Saul Williams.  [72]\n &#34;HeLa,&#34; a play by Chicago playwright  J. Nicole Brooks, was commissioned by  Sideshow Theatre Company in 2016, with a public staged reading on July 31, 2017. The play will eventually be produced by Sideshow, at Chicago&#39;s  Greenhouse Theater Center from November 18 to December 23, 2018. The play uses Lacks&#39; life story as a jumping point for a larger conversation about Afrofuturism, scientific progress, and bodily autonomy.  [73]\n In the series   El Ministerio del Tiempo, the immortality of her cells in the lab is cited as the precedent for the character Arteche&#39;s &#34;extreme resistance to infections, to injuries, and to cellular degeneration. In other words to aging&#34;: that his cells are immortal.  [74]\n    ^   Squamous cell carcinoma is a cancer of the squamous cells, a type of epithelial cell, and is the second most-common type of skin cancer. They are found on the neck, head, cervix, anus as well as other body sites.  [13]\n ^   Adenocarcinomas are a type of cancerous tumor or an abnormal growth of epithelial tissue. 10% to 15% of cancers of the cervix are adenocarcinomas, the rest more commonly being squamous cell carcinomas.  [15]\n ^  The roller-tube technique was invented by George Gey in his lab at the  University of Pittsburgh. &#34;And then there was the roller drum, the invention that churned in the enormous incubator room Gey built to keep the cell cultures warm. The huge metal drum with holes covering its inner surface gyrated like a cement mixer 24 hours a day. And tucked within each hole, at the bottom of Gey&#39;s home-blown-glass roller tubes, were tiny pieces of tissue bathed in nutrient-rich fluids, gathering the nourishment necessary for survival. As the drum rotated one turn every hour, the cells surfaced, free to breathe and excrete until the liquid bathed them again. If all went well, the cells adhere\n......", "posttime": "2020-07-06 19:02:53", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "During a conversation held Wednesday night on the invite-only Clubhouse app\u2014an audio social network popular with venture capitalists and celebrities\u2014entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan, several Andreessen Horowitz venture capitalists, and, for some reason, television personality Roland Martin spent at least an hour talking about how journalists have too much power to &#34;cancel&#34; people and wondering what they, the titans of Silicon Valley, could do about it.\n   The call shows how Silicon Valley millionaires, who have been coddled by the press and lauded as innovators and disruptors, fundamentally misunderstand the role of journalism the moment it turns a critical eye to their industry. It also suggests they\u2019re eager to find new ways to hit back at what they see as unfavorable and unfair press coverage.\n  Motherboard obtained a recording of the conversation, which took place on Clubhouse, an app which as of late May had just 1,500 users. The app was  valued at $100 million after a reported $12 million investment from Andreessen Horowitz, and requires an invite to join. In May,  New York Times internet culture reporter Taylor Lorenz wrote that the app is &#34;where venture capitalists have gathered to mingle with one another while they are quarantined in their homes.&#34;\n  &#34;Sometimes there is a tarot card reader critiquing a member\u2019s Instagram account; sometimes it is a dating advice show; sometimes bored people sound off about anything that pops into their mind,&#34;  she wrote.\n   On Wednesday night, the topic of conversation was Lorenz herself, who had been listening earlier in the conversation but left partway through. After she left, the participants began discussing whether Lorenz was playing &#34;the woman card&#34; when speaking out about her harassment following a Twitter altercation with Srinivasan.\n  &#34;You can&#39;t fucking hit somebody, attack them and just say, &#39;Hey, I have ovaries and therefore, you can&#39;t fight back,&#39;&#34; Felicia Horowitz, founder of the Horowitz Family Foundation and wife of Andreessen Horowitz cofounder Ben Horowitz, said.\n   In recent days Lorenz, who criticized luggage startup Away co-CEO Steph Korey on Twitter Wednesday, has been harassed and impersonated on Twitter.\n   On the call, Srinivasan suggested that Lorenz\u2014who earlier in the day had  accused him on Twitter of &#34;constantly trying to destroy my career on the internet and in private&#34;\u2014was overreacting and that she was perhaps scared of him, and that this was why she left the conversation that night on Clubhouse.\n  &#34;Is Taylor afraid of a brown man on the street? Then she shouldn&#39;t be afraid of a brown man in Clubhouse,&#34; Srinivasan said. &#34;I have literally done nothing other than one previous tweet. Number one, right? So the whole, you know, talking about tweeting as you know, harassment\u2014completely illegitimate, completely wrong, completely fabricated and just false.&#34;\n  The audio chat had spiraled wildly out of control from a broader conversation earlier in the call about the state of journalism and what VCs should do to receive better coverage. Srinivasan, formerly a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, claimed that &#34;the entire tech press was complicit in covering up the threat of COVID-19,&#34; and claimed that relying on the press is &#34;outsourcing your information supply chain to folks who are disaligned with you,&#34; comparable to the United States having outsourced its medical supply chain. He proposed that the approaches to truth and accountability offered by GitHub, venture capital funding, and cryptocurrency all offer better models for journalism than &#34;the East Coast model of &#39;Respect my authori-tay.&#39;&#34;\n   When asked for comment about the Clubhouse chat,  Srinivasan screenshotted our request and tweeted about it.\n  &#34;When it comes to our industry, there\u2019s a really, really toxic dynamic that exists right now,&#34; Nait Jones, an Andreessen Horowitz VC, said on the call while speaking about recent reports about abuse in the tech industry. &#34;Because those stories were so popular and drove so much traffic, they also created a market for more of those stories. They created a pressure on many reporters to find the next one of those stories inside of a fast growing tech company because those stories play very well on Twitter, especially around protecting vulnerable people.&#34;\n  (In 2020, the idea that fishing for  \u201cclicks\u201d to drive ad revenue is a successful or even common business model is a fallacy. Publications that rely exclusively on advertising are failing at an astonishing rate; financially, many journalistic outlets are increasingly moving away from an ad-based revenue model driven by traffic, and instead focus on live events, subscriptions, optioning their articles to movie studios, and other models that rely on having a dedicated readership that trusts the publication).\n  &#34;How can there be an accountability function that&#39;s implementable across all media that allows for that to happen, that pushback to happen without it being turned around and can become some toxic thing where all types of power dynamics are being used, and people have their weapons out,&#34; Jones said.\n   &#34;Her employer should be saying, you cross the line with your editorial comments,&#34; Martin said, adding that &#34;If I&#39;m [Srinivasan], the argument that I would make to her bosses is you should be instructing your reporters not to be making editorial judgments about someone. Stick to reporting.&#34;\n  The exclusive users of Clubhouse on the call seemed to conceive of themselves as humble citizens preyed upon by corrupted elites cravenly lusting after money and power; this reached a bizarre apogee when Srinivasan boasted of standing up for the CEO of a scandal-plagued luggage brand, depicting her as all but powerless because of her relatively low Twitter follower count. The conversation essentially resembled a Gamergate chat, with people obsessing over minute drama and, at times, suggesting that Lorenz had crossed a line on Twitter and must be punished.\n  \u201cTaylor is an excellent reporter doing incredibly relevant reporting for this moment. She, and all reporters, should be able to do their jobs without facing harassment,\u201d Choire Sicha, editor of the NYTimes Styles desk, told Motherboard in an email.\n  Clubhouse founders Rothan Seth and Paul Davison didn&#39;t respond to a request for comment. Jones did not respond to a request for comment. Andreessen Horowitz declined to comment.\n    The conversation was set off by a series of exhausting, insidery events from the last two weeks. Some in the Silicon Valley set turned their sights on the Times after Scott Alexander, a psychiatrist who ran the philosophy blog SlateStarCodex, deleted the entire blog because he said the Times was going to &#34;dox&#34; him by publishing his real name in an upcoming story. (It is worth noting that Alexander has republished SlateStarCodex blogs in books using his full name.) This event resurfaced an ongoing and tedious discussion among venture capitalist types about journalism ethics, business models, and publishing incentives.\n   Wednesday, Korey, the co-CEO of Away, a direct to consumer luggage brand that was the subject of an  expose in The Verge last year, published a series of Instagram Story posts in which she suggested that she was unfairly targeted by The Verge in part because she is a woman. She also said that journalists should be easier to sue, and suggested that the main thing driving journalism is &#34;clicks.&#34; The Verge story focused on a culture of abuse at Away under Korey&#39;s leadership; workers there said they were prevented from taking vacation, were banned from emailing each other, and worked extremely long hours.\n  \u201cThe incentive isn\u2019t to report what\u2019s happening,\u201d Korey wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s to write things that will be shared by people on social media. And several of these digital-only outlets have nearly nonexistent editorial standards (especially the click baity-y ones, you know who they are). Side note: I could write a whole separate essay about how defamation lawsuits should be easier to pursue now that misrepresentation *is* the business model of some of these outlets.\u201d (In the aftermath of The Verge&#39;s story, Korey announced  she\u2019d hired the well-known defamation firm Clare Locke LLP, which  has made a business out of getting unflattering stories stalled or killed.)\n  While Korey\u2019s Instagram comments were a supposed critique of the journalism industry, they looked at times a lot more like a claim that The Verge story was unfair or inaccurate in ways she didn\u2019t actually address.\n   After Korey posted her stories on Instagram, a number of journalists commented on them, including Lorenz, who tweeted &#34;Steph Korey, the disgraced former CEO of Away luggage company, is ranting on IG stories about the media. Her posts are incoherent and it\u2019s disappointing to see a woman who ran a luggage brand perpetuate falsehoods like this abt an industry she clearly has 0 understanding of.&#34;\n  Lorenz&#39;s tweet was immediately tweeted about by several Silicon Valley venture capitalists, most notably Srinivasan, who eventually made  a seven-tweet thread in which he suggested Lorenz, and journalists like her, are &#34;sociopaths.&#34;\n  That same day, a self-described Taylor Lorenz &#34;parody&#34; Twitter account started retweeting Srinivasan and other tech investors and executives critical of her work. The account&#39;s bio also links to a website, also self-described as parody, which is dedicated to harassing Lorenz. (Twitter told Motherboard it deleted another account for impersonating Lorenz.)\n  Yesterday Lorenz  called out Srinivasan on Twitter by tagging him and asked his friends, like Andreessen Horowitz co-founder Ben Horowitz, to help end the conflict, which eventually continued on Clubhouse.\n    In Korey&#39;s analysis, exposing the conditions of workers is clickbait designed to attract eyeballs; she also argued that female founders were more likely to be attacked, especially by young female reporters. The story about Korey\u2019s alleged misconduct was written by a young reporter named Zoe Schiffer. Korey added a few minutes later that she\u2019d gotten word her comments were filtering through to Twitter, and wrote, in part, \u201cI believe the overwhelming majority of young female reporters are truly excellent. It has been the case that the female-founder takedowns tend to be written by young women, but I do not think they represent the whole demographic whatsoever.\u201d\n     \u201cThe coverage seems to be so one-sided around the people running the companies,\u201d one person on the call whom Motherboard could not immediately identify complained. \u201cThey&#39;re all abusers, they&#39;re all trying to get rich. It&#39;s just down, down, down. It&#39;s almost depressing to watch, as someone who&#39;s an advocate for building things. It&#39;s hard to watch the coverage, it&#39;s almost anti-building things ...The whole entire DNA of Silicon Valley has been optimism from day one.&#34;\n  Articles like the Verge&#39;s investigation into Away do not appear out of thin air. People who work at tech companies\u2014often burdened with non-disclosure agreements\u2014take risks to discuss labor conditions at their company. At the time the Verge article was published, Korey apologized. Wednesday, she was suggesting she&#39;d been unfairly targeted, and that &#34;a few who are using the media platform they have access to further their careers by knowingly misrepresenting female founders for clicks &amp; their own profile/fame.&#34;\n  &#34;I spoke up for her because she had, you know, 8,000 followers, and she was being attacked by a  New York Times reporter as a disgraced former CEO and she&#39;s actually still, you know, current co-CEO,&#34; Srinivasan said. &#34;I believe in standing up for those people who don&#39;t have a voice, who cannot stand up for themselves.&#34;\n  Lost in the shuffle are the employees who say this apparently powerless CEO still presides over a broken company. Thursday afternoon, a coalition of Away employees emailed Away&#39;s leadership to say that &#34;Steph&#39;s Comments Are Hurting Us.&#34;\n   We \u201chave been hurt and left deflated by Steph Korey\u2019s recent action on Instagram and Twitter,&#34; they wrote in the email, which was obtained by Motherboard and was acknowledged by Away&#39;s cofounder Jen Rubio. &#34;We are writing to you as the employees of Away and asking that something is done to address the story that is building around Steph&#39;s Instagram and Twitter comments over the last several days.\n  Steph has been largely absent during this health pandemic, the company&#39;s layoffs and the civil unrest surrounding Black Lives Matter. This made sense. She was on mat leave and taking time to focus on her personal life over her professional one. This is why her social media activity over the last few days has been so surprising and frankly hurtful as employees of this company.&#34;\n      In response to a request for comment from Motherboard, Away&#39;s vice president of communications and corporate affairs shared two screenshots. The first was an email from Jen Rubio, Away&#39;s co-founder, president, and Chief Brand Officer, addressed to the employees who had complained about Korey&#39;s comments. (The email comes from Rubio&#39;s email account; it&#39;s also cosigned by Stuart Haselden, the company&#39;s co-CEO).\n  Rubio wrote that Korey&#39;s comments &#34;do not reflect or affect our current company priorities and the deep work we&#39;re doing about diversity, equity and inclusion.&#34; The email also stated that Stuart Haselden will take on the role of sole CEO at Away in 2020, and that Korey has updated her social media profiles to state that her views are her own.\n   In her own Slack response, Korey wrote: &#34;I understand that I have a responsibility as co-founder and co-CEO to commit to using my personal platforms to support our priorities, not distract by them.&#34; She apologized to &#34;anyone I hurt by shifting the focus away from these important cultural moments this past week,&#34; referring to the Black Lives Matter movement and the company&#39;s stated commitment to &#34;Diversity, Equity and Inclusion,&#34; as Korey put it. Both statements say Away&#39;s priority is &#34;becoming an anti-racist company.&#34;\n     This piece has been updated with comment from Away and to attribute a quote to a speaker on the Clubhouse call.", "posttime": "2020-07-06 18:43:38", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8d44\u672c\u5bb6,capitalists", "title": "\u98ce\u9669\u8d44\u672c\u5bb6\u5bf9\u65b0\u95fb\u4e1a\u7684\u6279\u8bc4\u79d8\u5bc6\u6cc4\u9732\u7ed9\u8bb0\u8005", "title_en": "Venture Capitalists' Critiques of Journalism Secretly Leaked to Journalists", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.vice.com/en_in/article/n7w3zw/silicon-valley-elite-discuss-journalists-having-too-much-power-in-private-app", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8d44\u672c\u5bb6"]}]
