And it isn’t because I’m so very good at this whole weaving thing, but it sort of is.  I’ve been weaving since the mid 70’s.  If there is a mistake, or screw up, I can assure you I made it or did it at some point in my career.  One of the glorious things about being a weaver is the pure tenacity that controls what we do and how we approach a situation.</p><p>自从我处理了一个大型织机以来，已经很长时间了。很长的时间。好像我不记得上一次了吗？这并不是因为我在整个编织方面都非常擅长，而是这样。从70年代中期开始，我一直在编织。如果有错误或搞砸了，我可以向您保证我在职业生涯中某个时候做到了或做到了。成为一名编织者的光荣事情之一就是控制我们做什么和如何处理局势的纯正坚韧。</p><p> Of course by now, you are all familiar with my daughter and her major accomplishments as a weaver.  She works for me now, and is responsible for converting all of my garment patterns into  digital downloads.  She is also responsible for filming, producing and editing all of my videos for my YouTube channel,   The Weaver Sews and writing all of the Closed Captioning.  (Yes, I caught that there were a couple of misspellings in previous episodes…)  I couldn’t have moved into this next portion of my professional life without her, but that’s not why I did it…</p><p> 当然，到现在为止，你们都已经熟悉了我的女儿和她作为织布工的主要成就。她现在为我工作，负责将我的所有服装样式转换为数字下载。她还负责为我的YouTube频道The Weaver Sews拍摄，制作和编辑我的所有视频，并撰写所有隐藏字幕。 （是的，我发现前几集中有一些拼写错误……）没有她，我无法进入职业生涯的下一个阶段，但这不是我这么做的原因……</p><p> My daughter, Brianna, yes she has a real name, not the one she uses on Facebook, was asked back last winter if she would give a lecture to her old weaving guild in MA, near where she went to school.  The lecture, on differential sett, was scheduled for April of this year.  And of course we all know what happened in the northeast by April.  The world was cancelled.</p><p> 我的女儿Brianna是个真实名字，而不是她在Facebook上使用的名字，去年冬天被问及是否愿意为她在学校附近的马萨诸塞州的旧编织协会做讲座。有关差异解决的讲座定于今年四月举行。当然，我们都知道四月东北发生了什么。世界被取消了。</p><p> Since my daughter is a soon to be 28 year old millennial, she does her best work under deadline pressure.  (Truth be told, so do I…)  The guild called her last week and asked if she would be willing to give the lecture remotely.  Hahahahah!  Of course she said yes, which is what I would have done at that age.  I use to have a sign on  my studio door that said, “Say yes, then worry…”</p><p> 由于我的女儿快要28岁了，她在截止日期的压力下尽了最大的努力。 （说实话，我也是如此...）公会上周打电话给她，问她是否愿意远程授课。哈哈哈哈哈！当然，她说是的，那是我那时的年龄。我曾经在工作室的门上贴着标语，说：``是的，然后担心...''</p><p> So my daughter had to build an entire lecture that only existed as an outline, and weave all the samples in less than two weeks (the lecture is next week), plus edit and create new content for me, plus work in the evenings on her schooling, (yes, she is still in school to get her vet tech license).  But that’s not why I did it….</p><p> 因此，我的女儿必须建立一个仅作为大纲而存在的整个演讲，并在不到两周的时间里编织所有样本（演讲是下周），还需要为我编辑和创建新内容，以及晚上在她身上进行工作上学（是的，她还在上学以获取兽医技术许可）。但这不是我这么做的原因...。</p><p> One of the samples Brianna decided to weave, was exploring what happens when you use differential sett with really slippery rayon, warp and weft, and then slippery rayon warp and a dragging kind of weft like Shetland wool.  The sample with the slippery rayon warp, though challenging, was completely successful.  She then wound a warp with the Shetland wool, and the idea was she would tie into the rayon warp and repeat the experiment with a rayon weft and a wool weft, producing an additional two samples.</p><p> Brianna决定编织的一个样本是，探索当您使用差速沉降法时，如果先使用真滑人造丝，经纱和纬纱，然后再使用人造丝湿滑和像设得兰群岛羊毛那样的拖曳纬纱，会发生什么情况。人造丝弯曲的样品虽然具有挑战性，但却是完全成功的。然后，她用设得兰群岛的羊毛缠绕经纱，其想法是将她束缚在人造丝经纱上，并用人造丝纬纱和羊毛纬纱重复该实验，再生产两个样品。</p><p> At one point, she said to me, as I was weaving on another of the looms in the studio, “This is ridiculous, tying in a new warp, I could have started fresh, sleying and rethreading in half the time…”  and I couldn’t disagree with her.  I’ve never found tying in a new warp to be a time saver.</p><p> 有一次，她对我说，当我在工作室的另一台织机上编织时，“这太荒谬了，绑在新的经纱上，我可以在一半的时间内开始新鲜，割伤和重新穿线……”和我不能不同意她。我从未发现捆绑新的经线可以节省时间。</p><p> I went off to do something else and came back and she had only tied in about 2/3rds of the warp, and she moved onto a different loom to do other samples of different weave structures.  She told me that she was fed up and didn’t have the time to waste tying in 600 ends on a table loom.  But that’s not why I did it…</p><p>我去做别的事情，然后回来，她只在经纱的2/3处扎了一下，然后她搬到另一台织机上，进行其他不同编织结构的样品。她告诉我说她受够了，没有时间浪费在桌子织机上的600个末端上。但这不是我这么做的原因...</p><p> I went off to other projects of my own, like writing the script for Friday’s   The Weaver Sews Youtube installment.  I came back and decided to finish tying in the rest of the warp, which would have been 200 ends.  It wasn’t a big deal, and I can do stuff like that in my sleep.  I was surprised when she directed me to make a square knot, I had always tied in new warps with an overhand knot, but I learned long ago that I didn’t argue with my late husband, and I don’t argue with his daughter.  Even though I have almost a half century of experience…</p><p> 我参加了自己的其他项目，例如为周五的The Weaver Sews Youtube编写脚本。我回来了，决定结束其余的经纱的绑扎，这将是200头。没什么大不了的，我可以在睡眠中做类似的事情。当她指示我打一个方结时，我感到很惊讶，我总是以新手打结，将新结扎起来，但是很久以前我才知道我没有和已故的丈夫吵架，也没有和他的女儿吵架。 。即使我有将近半个世纪的经验……</p><p> I finished the task and then turned the job of beaming the 1  1/2 yard warp of sticky Shetland wool, onto the warp beam, over to my daughter.  I think I went off to bed…</p><p> 我完成了任务，然后将将1 1/2码的粘的设得兰群岛羊毛经线束到经线束上的工作交给了我的女儿。我想我去睡觉了...</p><p> I came back the next day to find the warp abandoned.  It was a complete disaster.  I don’t think even at my worst I’ve ever had a mess like that.  Partly I take some responsibility because my daughter has worked along side of me since she first learned to throw a shuttle.  She never had the opportunity to fall flat on her face, like most weavers, including me, have had to do.  I’ve always been there to guide her, when she chooses to listen to me.  But that’s not why I did it…</p><p> 我第二天回来，发现经纱被遗弃了。那是一场彻底的灾难。我认为即使在最糟糕的时候，我也不会遇到这样的麻烦。我之所以承担部分责任，是因为我的女儿自从她第一次学会扔穿梭车以来就一直与我同在。她从来没有机会像大多数织布工（包括我在内）那样平躺在脸上。当她选择听我讲话时，我一直在那里指导她。但这不是我这么做的原因...</p><p> Largely what happened, is that when she put tensioning bars in the back of the warp, and tried to beam the new sticky Shetland warp into the old slick rayon warp, the square knots didn’t hold, they slipped right out.  And for some reason, the Shetland wool ends, that slipped out of the knots, ended up in the front of the beater, probably about 200 of the 600 ends.  I think this wins an award for the most messed up warp I’ve ever seen.  That’s partly why I did it…</p><p> 发生的大部分事情是，当她在经纱的后部放张紧杆，并试图将新的粘性设得兰群岛经纱传送到旧的光滑人造丝经纱中时，方结没有固定住，它们就滑了下来。由于某种原因，设得兰群岛的羊毛结头从打结处滑落，最终出现在打浆机的前端，大概是600个结头中的200个。我认为这是我见过的最混乱的经纱获得的奖项。这就是我这么做的部分原因...</p><p>  I felt really sorry for my daughter, she was trying so hard to see this lecture into fruition…  But that’s not why I did it…</p><p>  我为我的女儿感到非常抱歉，她正在努力让这次讲座取得成果...但这不是我这么做的原因...</p><p> I felt partly responsible because I knew that when you tie in a warp, you always use overhand knots.  There are a lot of things I know, but I don’t know why I know them.  And because my daughter requested square knots, I obliged.  But that’s not why I did it…</p><p> 我感到部分负责，因为我知道当您扎紧经纱时，总是会使用过头打结。我知道很多东西，但我不知道为什么我知道它们。而且因为我的女儿要求打结，所以我不得不。但这不是我这么做的原因...</p><p> I laid awake all Thursday night haunted by the mess on one of the looms in the garage right underneath of me.  I kept thinking, if that were me, I wouldn’t have gone to bed without fixing it.  But that’s me, even though I knew I had a video to shoot in the morning. I didn’t sleep the whole night.  My daughter just moved to a different loom, and started on a different group of samples she had been planning.</p><p>整个星期四晚上，我躺在我下面车库中的一台织布机上，被乱糟糟的地方困住了。我一直在想，如果那是我的话，我不修好床就不会上床睡觉。就是我，尽管我知道我早上有一个视频要拍摄。我整晚没睡。我的女儿刚搬到另一台织机上，开始进行她计划的另一组样品。</p><p> In fact my daughter was so upset by what happened that she couldn’t even look at the loom. She couldn’t even walk over to that area of the studio.   She is not use to having major loom screw ups…  I’ve largely protected her from that…  But that’s not why I did it…</p><p> 实际上，我的女儿对发生的事情感到非常沮丧，以至于她什至无法看一下织机。她甚至无法走到工作室的那个区域。她不习惯使用大型织机拧紧螺丝...我在很大程度上保护了她免受此伤害...但这不是我这么做的原因...</p><p> We stopped everything to shoot the new video Friday morning, and I had some computer/business stuff to attend to, but Friday afternoon, I sat at the loom and thought, it has been a very long time since I’ve bailed a loom out of a major temper tantrum, and you know what?  I really wanted to just dive in there and fix it.  That’s why I wanted to do it.</p><p> 我们在星期五早上停止了一切来拍摄新视频，我有一些电脑/业务资料要参加，但是星期五下午，我坐在织机上，以为，自从我把织机保释出来以来已经很长时间了。发脾气，你知道吗？我真的很想潜入那里并修复它。这就是为什么我想要这样做。</p><p> A couple of years ago, I had my new to me dog chew up a skein of yarn that was being wound into pirns for the weft yarn for a project I was working on.  I got distracted by the doorbell, and when I returned I found  the skein stretched around my loom, and all the way down the stairs, and the skein chewed beyond help.  I can’t believe the number of weaver’s who offered to have me send them the skein and promised to untangle every last yard.  There is something about fixing a monumental disaster that is really appealing for a weaver.</p><p> 几年前，我给我的新狗嚼了一根绞纱，将其缠绕成用于我正在从事的项目的纬纱的大头针。我被门铃分散了注意力，当我回到家时，发现绞线在我的织布机上张开，一直下到楼梯上，绞线无助地嚼着。我不敢相信愿意让我把绞线送给他们的织布工的数目，并答应解开最后一码。修复巨大的灾难确实对编织者有吸引力。</p><p>  I sort of think that it has to do with creating calm in chaos.  There is so little in the world that we have any control over.  But what happens at our looms, that thing, we have control over.  And if what happens on our looms becomes total chaos, then patience, tenacity, and time will make it work.  That’s why I did it.</p><p>  我认为这与在混乱中保持冷静有关。世界上几乎没有什么可以控制的。但是在我们的织机上发生的事情是，我们可以控制。而且，如果我们织机上发生的事情变得非常混乱，那么耐心，坚韧和时间将使其发挥作用。这就是我这样做的原因。</p><p> So I started Friday afternoon, after the shoot, and I began to reassess the 600 ends and how to best resolve the mess.  Cutting the whole thing off and starting over was an option, but it would mean wasting a perfectly good 1 1/2 yard Shetland warp, that I paid good money for…</p><p> 因此，我在拍摄后的星期五下午开始拍摄，然后我开始重新评估600头以及如何最好地解决问题。裁掉整个东西并重新开始是一种选择，但这意味着浪费完美的1 1/2码设得兰群岛翘曲，我为此付出了很多钱……</p><p> I decided that the best way out, was to carefully pull the warps that ended up in front of the reed, since they were only 1 1/2 yards, and resleying them where required (because this was a differential sett warp, there were dents where there were as many as five ends) and then carefully tying them back into the slippery rayon warps that went through the heddles, one by one.  I probably spent 10 hours.  This was really really challenging.</p><p> 我认为最好的出路是小心地拉出最终在芦苇前面的经纱，因为它们只有1 1/2码，然后在需要的地方重新铺设（因为这是一个不同的沉降经纱，所以有凹痕那里有多达五个末端），然后小心地将它们一一绑在光滑的人造丝经线中。我大概花了10个小时。这确实非常具有挑战性。</p><p>  I did it because there is something intensely satisfying about bringing order to chaos.  There is something intense about saving a project.  I had my doubts that this was even weaveable, 5 ends of Shetland in a 12 dent reed on a table loom didn’t see realistic, but that wasn’t for me to judge.  I grabbed my 5X glasses, a magnifying OTT lite, and a sley hook and started in.  10 hours later I was triumphant.</p><p>我之所以这样做，是因为在使秩序混乱方面，人们感到非常满意。保存项目有些紧张。我很怀疑这是不是可以编织的，设得兰群岛的5个末端，放在织布机上的12个凹痕的芦苇上，看似不切实际，但这不是我可以判断的。我拿起5倍眼镜，一个OTT lite放大镜和一个轻便的钩子，开始穿行.10个小时后，我胜利了。</p><p>  As I suspected, the warp was unweaveable at that dentage, Brianna had to pull some of the densest parts of the warp, but after much bitching and kvetching, she managed to get the sample she needed, but that’s not why I did it…</p><p>  正如我所怀疑的那样，经纱在那个假牙上是不可织造的，布赖恩娜不得不拉扯经纱的一些最密实的部分，但是经过反复的咬牙接骨，她设法得到了所需的样品，但这不是我这样做的原因……</p><p>  For all of you out there who have ever had to deal with the warp from hell, remember that there is something healing in finally controlling that which would not be controlled, something triumphant about making something from total chaos.  And that’s  why I did it.  It has been a long time since I’ve had to bail out a major loom screw up, and I loved every minute of it.  It wasn’t my screw up, but I felt like a warrior on a mission and I was ultimately successful.  Mission accomplished.  It was sort of poignant that in the middle of the last inch and a half, that the election finals were called.  No matter who you supported, the wait is over.  And there is a sort of relief there, and now we as a nation can move forward to what I hope is a common goal.  My ten hours of determination over a warp from hell was finally over.  And I won.</p><p>  对于所有曾经不得不从地狱中解决扭曲问题的人，请记住，在最终控制那些无法控制的东西方面，有些东西可以治愈，而从完全的混乱中制造出一些东西，则是一种胜利。这就是我这样做的原因。自从我不得不挽救一台大型织机以来已经很长时间了，我喜欢其中的每一分钟。这不是我的事，但我感觉像是执行任务的战士，最终我成功了。任务完成。在最后一刻半的时间里，召集选举总决赛真是令人发指。无论您支持谁，等待都结束了。那里有种解脱，现在作为一个国家，我们可以朝着我希望的共同目标前进。我从地狱中挣扎了十个小时的决心终于结束了。我赢了。</p><p> Brianna did manage to beam and weave the new samples.  She did as I suspected have to cull some of the warps in the densest part of the reed.  But she learned that on her own.  And she also learned that when tying in a new warp, you should use overhand knots.  But kids learn by falling flat on their faces and picking themselves up and reevaluating the experience.  I never had anyone to tell me otherwise, so I learned the hard way, by trial and error, but that weaver’s tenacity kept me moving forward.</p><p> Brianna确实成功地对新样品进行了编织。正如我所怀疑的，她做到了，必须剔除芦苇最密部分的一些经线。但是她是自己学到的。她还了解到，在绑扎新经线时，应该使用过头打结。但是孩子们会平躺下来然后振作起来，重新评估自己的经历，从而学习。我从来没有其他人要告诉我，所以我通过反复试验学会了艰难的方法，但是编织者的坚韧使我前进。</p><p>  To say that I’m so proud of the body of samples she has produced as a result of this exploration in differential sett would be an understatement.  And what she has learned from things that I would have loved to have prevented from my vast experience would have deprived both of us from an experience that ultimately benefitted both of us.</p><p>  要说我为她因进行差分沉降探索而产生的大量样品感到骄傲，这是一种轻描淡写的说法。她从我本来希望避免的丰富经验中学到的东西会使我们俩都失去了最终使我们俩受益的经验。</p><p> So next time you are faced with the warp from hell, have a drink, and dive in head first.  There is some personal triumph that no one else but a weaver will understand…</p><p> 因此，下一次您将面对来自地狱的扭曲，喝一杯，然后先潜水。有一些个人的胜利，只有织工才能理解…</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div
