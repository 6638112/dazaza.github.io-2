It has killed or endangered wildlife in freshwater ecosystems, with high chloride levels toxic to fish, bugs and amphibians, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  \u201cIt\u2019s an issue that requires attention now,\u201d said Bill Hintz, an assistant professor in the environmental sciences department at the University of Toledo and the lead author of a recent research review published in the journal  Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment.\n  \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of scientific evidence to suggest that freshwater ecosystems are being contaminated by salt from the use of things like road salt beyond the concentration which is safe for freshwater organisms and for human consumption,\u201d Dr. Hintz said.\n  Salt has been used to de-ice roads in the United States since the 1930s, and its use across the country has tripled in the past 50 years, Dr. Hintz said. More than 20 million metric tons of salt are poured on U.S. roads each winter, according to an estimate by the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in New York, and the environmental costs are growing.\n  Still, little has been done to address the environmental impact of road salt because it is cheap and effective, said Victoria Kelly, the environmental programming manager at the Cary Institute. By lowering the freezing temperature of water, salt prevents snow from turning to ice and melts ice that is already there.\n Road salt is made from sodium chloride, the same chemical found in table salt. Of all salt consumed in the United States, about 43 percent is used for highway de-icing, according to the U.S. Geological Survey in 2020.\n  The consequences of insufficiently salting roads were seen this week, when hundreds of drivers were stranded by  a snowstorm on Interstate 95 in Virginia. Officials said the storm began with rain, which washed away road salt and made it difficult to keep roads clear.  More snow fell in the Mid-Atlantic States and the Northeast on Friday.\n But environmentalists say the problems associated with road salt are getting harder to ignore. Ms. Kelly said the accumulation of salt in drinking water reservoirs in some places was harming people on low-sodium diets.\n  A 2018 study of wells in Dutchess County, N.Y., found that sodium concentration in wells reached levels as high as 860 milligrams per liter \u2014 much higher than the  federal and state recommendation that levels not exceed 20 milligrams per liter for people on very low-sodium diets and 270 milligrams per liter for people on moderately restricted sodium diets.\n A separate 2018 study in the journal Environmental Science and Technology showed that 24 percent of private drinking wells in New York were contaminated with salt that had been used on roads. About 15 percent of people in the United States get their water from private ground wells, while the rest rely on community water systems, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n More counties and states are rethinking the amount of salt they use because of the associated costs. Last month, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York announced appointments to the Adirondack Road Salt Reduction Task Force, established to review road-salt contamination.\n \u201cI have no doubt that this group of individuals will work tirelessly to protect our state from the adverse effects of road salt,\u201d Ms. Hochul said. \u201cWe look forward to seeing this group finally convene and make progress in preventing further pollution to our waterways and our environment.\u201d\n  There are consequences for wildlife, too. Dr. Hintz said his review showed that elevated salinity levels in freshwater ecosystems had already caused a reduction in the abundance and growth of freshwater organisms and a reduction in their reproduction outputs.\n Card 1 of 3 Biden\u2019s climate agenda in peril.  President Biden is facing an  increasingly narrow path\u00a0to fulfill his ambitious environmental goals with the\u00a0Build Back Better Act \u2014 which contains $555 billion in proposed climate action \u2014  in limbo on Capitol Hill.\n How some cities are reducing emissions.  A district in London has developed an innovative way to  divert subway heat for buildings to lower carbon emissions. Stockholm and Vancouver are turning to waste heat from sewage instead.\n Sounding the alarm.  A report on the state of the Arctic  highlights troubling and consistent trends\u00a0in the region that are linked to global warming. Researchers are  also growing increasingly concerned about Antarctica, where ice shelves are melting and wilder winds are altering crucial currents.\n Road salt also corrodes vehicles and bridges, causing $5 billion in annual repairs in the United States, according to an estimate by the Environmental Protection Agency. AAA suggests drivers wash and clean their vehicles regularly during winter to help offset the effects of road salt and to limit driving when salt and other de-icing chemicals are at their highest concentrations.\n In Britain, the Salt Association said that salt was the cheapest form of de-icing material and that it had a low environmental impact when used responsibly. \u201cAs with all highway maintenance activities, there are environmental implications from winter road maintenance,\u201d the organization said in a statement. \u201cHighways depots, spreading vehicles and the de-icing agent all contribute, but with good management, this burden can be minimized.\u201d\n  While there is not a perfect solution to the issue, there are alternatives that can significantly reduce salt usage without compromising driver safety.\n One method involves treating roads before storms with a salt brine solution, which can lead to a 75 percent reduction in the amount of salt used while keeping roads just as safe, according to the Cary Institute. Building better salt storage sites can also minimize waste.\n Some counties, like Jefferson County, Wis., have already made changes. Bill Kern, the county\u2019s highway commissioner, said switching to a brine solution had enabled the county to cut its salt use by up to 60 percent since 2018 without an increase in the number of accidents. By using less salt, the county has reduced its overall cost for winter maintenance of state and county highways by 20 percent since 2018, saving about $1.6 million, Mr. Kern said.\n Over the past decade, some states, including Rhode Island, have passed legislation aimed to reduce their use of road salt and have increasingly applied a brine solution to roads in winter, but environmentalists say more needs to be done.\n  While engineers have developed better alternatives, they have not been widely implemented in part because they require upfront costs for purchasing equipment, Ms. Kelly said.\n \u201cIt\u2019ll save us money, and it\u2019ll help to save our freshwater,\u201d she said, while adding that \u201cbecause of that legacy effect, it\u2019s going to take a really long time to see the impact of the steps we take.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:32:20", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u9053\u8def,salt", "title": "\u9053\u8def\u76d0\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u4f46\u5b83\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u4e5f\u5f88\u7cdf\u7cd5\u3002", "title_en": "Road Salt Works.

Bitcoin offers protection against rampant government spending, says Kasparov, \u201cbecause you\u2019re protected by math\u201d \u2013 by the logic of the code itself.\n  Kasparov also sees merit in  non-fungible tokens. In December, in partnership with  1Kind, he dropped a series of 32 NFTs that showcase iconic moments from his life: the 1985 match that crowned him as the youngest world chess champion, the epic battle against International Business Machines\u2019 artificial intelligence-powered \u201cDeep Blue\u201d and speeches against totalitarian governments.\n It\u2019s this battle against totalitarianism that has defined the current chapter of his life, and Kasparov sees crypto as part of that struggle. Or as the grandmaster puts it, \u201cI believe that supporting crypto is an important part of my contribution to the future of humanity.\u201d\n   Kasparov: If you followed my career and read about my early interest in computers and technology, you should not be surprised that I was very excited when I recognized the value of cryptocurrencies and NFTs.\n This goes all the way back to the \u201880s; I always tried to be at the cutting edge. It started with chess. But I also saw an opportunity to use computers and new tools to advance individual freedoms. It\u2019s my belief that technology should help people fight back against the power of the state.\n  Cryptocurrencies become an inseparable part of or progress, because the whole world is moving digital. And if the economy becomes more digital, so does the money. Another philosophical reason is that \u2026 governments [have] unlimited opportunities to print money. And printing money is the most exquisite form of borrowing from us and from future generations.\n And I believe that cryptocurrencies \u2013 with bitcoin as a standard \u2013 offer a protection against this onslaught of the government, because you\u2019re protected by math. You\u2019re protected by the limited number of any code behind the respective currency. Cryptocurrencies, and all the products related to cryptocurrencies, are absolutely vital for the future development of our world.\n   My first indirect involvement was through the Human Rights Foundation. Because in the Human Rights Foundation, we had a few experts that have been advocating cryptocurrencies at a very early stage. And as an organization, we offer support to the dissidents around the world.\n We thought about using crypto as a way to help them to get material help, because in many countries it was impossible \u2013 and it\u2019s still impossible \u2013 to actually get proper funding. So crypto offered an opportunity to support these activists indirectly. And the more I learned about it, the more interested I got in the whole mechanism.\n  Look, crypto is a controversial thing. Because you hear a lot of people say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s money laundering. That helps bad guys.\u201d True. I mean, no technology is uniquely good, because it\u2019s technology. Humans still have a monopoly for evil.\n So, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of talks about it, and I\u2019ll say, \u201cLook, it\u2019s not the magic wand or the terminator. It\u2019s not a harbinger of utopia or dystopia. It\u2019s a tool.\u201d Crypto is a tool. And of course it could benefit some bad guys with maligned intentions. But it\u2019s about the balance, it\u2019s about trade-offs. And I think the balance is so much in favor of progress.\n  You mentioned crypto\u2019s ability to help protect human rights in undemocratic countries. What do you see as the benefits in democratic countries?\n In the democratic countries in America and Europe, trillions of dollars will be printed. I\u2019m an American taxpayer. And I understand that you need to build new infrastructure. But I\u2019m not happy to see that the government has a free hand to use my taxes, basically to devalue [the dollar].\n So I think it\u2019s very important that technology would offer me an opportunity to fight back, to protect my hard-earned fortune. And I think that bitcoin \u2013 which I believe is online gold \u2013 and other cryptocurrencies are the way to the future. I\u2019m not a financial expert, but I would not be surprised if, I would not be surprised if, in 10 years\u2019 time, the dollar will be replaced by the basket of coins as a standard.\n   I suppose if you believe that, then it would almost be foolish not to be buying Bitcoin?\n   Well, I think bitcoin will remain as a standard. But of course it cannot stay alone. So that\u2019s why you have more coins coming in. It\u2019s a natural process. Now we have thousands and thousands of coins. It\u2019s like the dot-com bubble. Ninety-nine point nine percent will be gone. But those that survive will become the Googles of the world. I\u2019m not here to judge which one, but there will be few that will survive \u2013 that\u2019s why I said basket of coins.\n In the past, your championing of human rights has gotten you in trouble with the Russian authorities. Given that background, are you concerned that your support for cryptocurrency can get you in hot water?\n Well, this is definitely a no. [In the past,] I was in hot water. To give you an idea, one of the NFTs is a picture of my first arrest in Russia. So it\u2019s all reflected in my NFT. Look, this is much less perilous than to attack Putin directly.\n I grew up in the Soviet Union, and learned from my mother and my teacher the motto of Soviet dissidents, \u201cDo what you must, and so be it.\u201d And I believe that supporting crypto is an important part of my contribution to the future of humanity. And, again, I [view it] as a much less risky endeavor than speaking publicly about Putin or other dictators.\n   I don\u2019t pretend to be a great expert in NFTs, but I\u2019m not aware of anything similar that exists. It\u2019s a collection of 30-plus NFTs that are related to special events in my life and special people in my life. This is a story that connects you to very personal moments. Every NFT has a video message.\n It\u2019s all connected to the physical assets, like my notebooks from the \u201870s. Thanks to my late mother, who preserved this archive, you can actually look at me scribbling in 1973.\n The NFTs all reflect the moments of me growing up, learning from my mother, and from my teachers, and then fighting for the title, and then shifting my life and moving into human rights and computers.\n Interesting. This feels almost like a memoir, in a sense. I\u2019ve worked with CEOs before to collaborate on their memoirs, and one thing I\u2019ve found is that the process can almost be emotional, or even a bit therapeutic. Did you have any sense of that?\n The whole story starts from a very emotional moment, though it\u2019s a tragic one. My mother died on Christmas day last year, from COVID. And I couldn\u2019t be next to her, and that was a really big blow because we were so close.\n While she was alive, I didn\u2019t even know that she preserved all these archives. She was not happy to talk about the past. That\u2019s why I [held off] on any major publication that would highlight [the past]. I wrote two books, but not the one that could tell everything.\n After she died, I thought it would be right for me [to honor] her memory to actually start doing things. I\u2019m doing a documentary now; it\u2019s in Russian. The first segment will be ready early next year. And I hope I can cover my entire chess career, and it\u2019s for her. It\u2019s dedicated for her. And this [NFT] project was inspired by this tragedy. I thought it was very important to show my personal life and her connection, and why she was so important.\n And so I spoke to 1Kind, and 10% of the sales will go to Kasparov Chess Foundation, and this will be a scholarship under her name for all the great talents raised by single mothers.\n  The leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a  strict set of editorial policies.

The protests began in the west of the country over the weekend, after a sharp rise in fuel prices, and quickly spread through cities across the nation.\n The internet was shut down nationwide on Wednesday. And though the intent appeared to be to disrupt the protesters\u2019 communications, the effects of the blackout have spread further.\n Kazakhstan is a power player in the bitcoin world. Last year, the nation became the world\u2019s second-largest center for bitcoin mining after the United States, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, after China, a major hub, clamped down on crypto mining activity. As of August, Kazakhstan was hosting 18% of global bitcoin mining, according to  Fortune.\n  Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are created or \u201cmined\u201d by high-powered computers, usually at data centers in different parts of the world that compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles in a highly energy-intensive process.\n The more miners on the network, the greater the amount of computer power is needed to mine new bitcoin. The hashrate falls if miners drop off the network, in theory making it easier for the remaining miners to produce new coin.\n The hashrate at major crypto mining pools \u2013 groups of miners in different locations that team up to produce bitcoin \u2013 was down 14% from Tuesday to Thursday, according to data from mining firm BTC.com.\n Bitcoin\u2019s price, too, took a plunge \u2013 a drop in hashrate doesn\u2019t necessarily boost price. The cryptocurrency fell below $43,000 on Thursday, testing multi-month lows.\n  Economics aside, bitcoin\u2019s negative  environmental impact has been an ongoing issue. Blockchain-based currencies require large amounts of power, which is mostly derived from fossil fuels. And in Kazakhstan, specifically, the power behind bitcoin is cause for concern.\n Coal is the main source of regional power. Kazakhstan\u2019s crypto mining farms are mostly powered by ageing coal plants which themselves \u2013 along with coalmines and whole towns built around them \u2013 are a headache for authorities as they seek to decarbonize the economy. Since the old plants are inefficient and carbon-heavy, they generate an outsize amount of pollution.\n According to the  International Energy Agency, Kazakhstan\u2019s emissions per energy unit are higher than what China\u2019s used to be. The agency estimates that China\u2019s coal emitted about 1,000g of CO 2 a kilowatt hour, while Kazakhstan\u2019s emits close to 1,500g.\n The Kazakh government said last year it planned to crack down first on unregistered \u201cgrey\u201d miners who it estimates might be consuming twice as much power as the \u201cwhite\u201d or officially registered ones.\n Last year, its energy ministry said that \u201cgrey\u201d mining may consume up to 1.2GW of power, which together with \u201cwhite\u201d miners\u2019 600MW comes up to about 8% of Kazakhstan\u2019s total generation capacity.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:28:40", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01,\u4f18\u60e0,internet,\u6316\u6398", "title": "\u54c8\u8428\u514b\u65af\u5766\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u5173\u95ed\u4f18\u60e0\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u91c7\u77ff\u4e1a\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u6253\u51fb", "title_en": "Kazakhstan Internet Shutdown Deals Blow To Global Bitcoin Mining Operation", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/kazakhstan-bitcoin-internet-shutdown", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01", "\u4f18\u60e0", "internet", "\u6316\u6398"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d1df198affec6555963c51dcc78b00a1.jpg", "infoid": 1072499, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u5468\u56db\u76d1\u7763Firefox\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5468\u56db\u627f\u8ba4\u4e86\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u6f5c\u5728\u5730\u6784\u6210\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u793a\u6b63\u5728\u5ba1\u67e5\u5176\u76ee\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u52a0\u5bc6\u6350\u8d60\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u201c\u9002\u5408\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6c14\u5019\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u201d\n\u56f4\u7ed5\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u73af\u5883\u8db3\u8ff9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5df2\u4e0e\u5404\u79cd\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u521b\u5efa\u65b9\u5f0f\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002 Bitcoin\u548cEthereum\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u5de5\u4f5c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u8584\u8377\u7684\u6bcf\u79cd\u8d27\u5e01\u7684\u65b0\u5757\u4f9b\u7535\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u8ba1\u7b97\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u7f51\u7edc\u589e\u957f\u5e76\u751f\u4e0b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u56f4\u7ed5\u65f6\u949f\u56f4\u7ed5\u7740\u6570\u5343\u4e2aGPU\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u751f\u80b2\uff0c\u4ee5\u53c2\u4e0e\u89e3\u51b3\u96be\u9898\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u3002", "note_en": "The foundation, which oversees the development of the Firefox browser, on Thursday acknowledged conversations around the environmental impact that cryptocurrencies potentially pose and said it is reviewing whether its current policy on crypto donations \u201c fits with our climate goals.\u201d\n \u201cDecentralized web technology continues to be an important area for us to explore, but a lot has changed since we started accepting crypto donations,\u201d the foundation said in a tweet thread, pledging to be forthcoming about the updates of its review.\n  The foundation started to face backlash after it invited people to donate to the American nonprofit firm via using a variety of crypto tokens, including bitcoin.\n In response to its tweet, Jamie Zawinski (a founder of Mozilla)\u00a0 expressed dismay at the foundation\u2019s move. \u201cEveryone involved in the project should be witheringly ashamed of this decision to partner with planet-incinerating Ponzi grifters,\u201d he said, adding an expletive.\n Peter Linss, the founder of Gecko, the engine that powered the browser,  joined the conversation in telling Mozilla that it was \u201cmeant to be better than this.\u201d\n This isn\u2019t the first time a major firm has faced backlash \u2014 or distanced itself from Bitcoin \u2014 because of environmental concerns. In May last year, Tesla suspended accepting bitcoin as payment for its vehicles, just  months after introducing the option.\n  Musk said the firm was \u201cconcerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal.\u201d Weeks later, he said the company will \u201cmost likely\u201d  accept bitcoin again once the mining rate for the cryptocurrency reaches 50% renewables.\n Questions around the environmental footprint of Bitcoin have been linked to how various tokens are created. Bitcoin and Ethereum use a mechanism called proof-of-work to power their networks and mint new blocks of each currency. This calculation, by design, has become more complex over the years as the networks grew and gave birth to an industry of firms that run thousands of GPUs around the clock to participate in solving the puzzle.\n Bitcoin mining consumes about 148 terawatt-hours of energy annually, the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance estimates. Many cryptocurrency proponents have, however, either\u00a0 disputed such findings or have made a case for why it is worth it.\n In recent months, a broader divide has started to emerge in the industry. The critics have challenged some of the fundamental value proposition of web3. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, who supports Bitcoin, has  dismissed the assertion that VCs aren\u2019t reaping most profits from web3 projects.\n Amid the ongoing discourse, many firms have\u00a0scaled back their web3 ambitions.

We are grateful to our Limited Partners who have believed in us and stuck with us over the past 12 years and hope to earn their trust once again. We thank our many wonderful entrepreneurs who made this set of funds possible.\n One might ask: \u201cWhy invest $9B in a brand new set of technology companies?\u201d Our answer begins with one of the firm\u2019s core   cultural values :   We believe in the future and we bet the firm that way.\n At Andreessen Horowitz, we specifically believe in the technology-enabled future. There are no more worthwhile endeavors than our most brilliant minds taking great risks to improve the world by doing something larger than themselves. As my partner Marc describes in   Technology Saves the World , without great advances in technology, life on Earth certainly will not get better and may well get worse.\n Beyond that, we see entrepreneurs every day with potential solutions ranging from a fairer creative economy to better education for low income students to cures for cancer. We never know which of these will work and that\u2019s why we value the people who bet their careers and their lives on solving these problems.\n It is our role and mission to help these entrepreneurs build the best companies they can and achieve their important goals. With these new funds, including a $1.5B Bio fund, $5B Growth fund, and $2.5B Venture fund, coupled with the $2.2B Crypto Fund and $400M Seed Fund we raised in 2021, we will continue to invest across the entire spectrum of stages, writing checks as small as $25,000 and up to hundreds of millions of dollars.\n    The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

Put more simply, Ottawa-based Assent aims to help manufacturers make smarter decisions regarding \u201cwho they do business with and how their products are sourced,\u201d notes CEO Andrew Waitman.\n And today, the company is announcing it has raised $350 million at a valuation of more than $1 billion in a funding round led by Vista Equity Partners. The financing follows a $131 million Series C raise led by Warburg Pincus, which remains the company\u2019s largest shareholder.\n  Interestingly, Assent was bootstrapped for the first five years of its life \u2014 from 2010 to 2015. In the subsequent years, after Waitman came on as CEO, the company has raised over $500 million and grew its headcount from about 20 to 820 today (45% of which identify as female). While half a billion dollars raised in the U.S. is not uncommon, it\u2019s a bit more rare in the Canadian tech scene.\n Assent\u2019s trajectory continues to grow and Waitman projects the SaaS company will cross $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) this year after growing ARR by over 50% in the past 12 months. Its customers include the likes of  GE Appliances, Polaris, Stryker and Escatec.\n The company delivers enterprise-wide supply chain sustainability solutions across product compliance, trade compliance and ESG \u2014 better known as  Environmental, Social and (Corporate) Governance . Assent has made a name for itself by being exclusively focused on complex manufacturing. Doubling down on that niche has allowed it to build what it claims is \u201cthe industry\u2019s largest network of supplier intelligence.\u201d Specifically, it works to help complex manufacturers proactively identify and manage risk, accelerate market access and growth and promote brand reputation.\n Assent\u2019s compliance platform provides centralized access to supply chain data for use by teams across a given company. It automates data collection and validation and provides \u201cconfigurable\u201d reporting so that its customers \u201ccan stay ahead\u201d of their data requirements.\n  \u201cThe increasing complexity and scale of regulations and varying requirements globally, combined with a heightened focus on ESG, presents challenges for companies across industries, particularly for manufacturers,\u201d Waitman said. \u201cAssent enables deep insight and rapid transparency to help ensure products are made with environmental and human rights standards necessary to compete \u2014 and win \u2014 in markets of the future.\u201d\n  The company plans to use its new capital mostly to continue expanding in Europe, eventually enter the Asian market and grow its headcount by 40% across its sales, services, engineering, customer success and marketing teams.\n \u201cManufacturing represents 20% of GDP,\u201d Waitman told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s an enormous market.\u201d\n Vista\u2019s Foundation Fund, which invests in middle-market companies seeking to scale and accelerate their growth trajectory, led the investment.

This post deals with my impression that academia isdoing a disservice to \u2018T-shaped persons,\u2019 i.e.  persons combining deepexpertise in one or more fields with an ability to collaborate acrossareas. T-shaped personsare often contrasted with I-shaped persons, commonly known as experts.  1Given the state of the art in the software industry,  2 T-shaped peopleare a sought-for commodity: the current \u2018framework du jour\u2019 might beobsolete in a few years, but the horizontal bar of a T-shaped personensures that they can also contribute to other aspects of a project, andquite likely will develop new vertical bars, i.e. new expertise overtime.  3\n Output above all else.As I am looking at the many resumes and motivational letters fromexcellent students all over the globe, it occurred to me that academiais not necessarily kind to the Ts: the primary metric in academic hiringis still the \u2018scientific output,\u2019 which is measured in publications suchas journal articles, conference articles, etc. In machine learningresearch, the fast pace of the field now has created a situation inwhich even aspiring Ph.D. candidates are often expected to have a fewpublications under the belt already. Coming from mathematics, whereone paper  every few years\u00a0(!) is considered the mark ofa productive mathematician, these expectations are bonkers to me, andI wonder how many capable candidates end up pursuing other goals becauseof these invisible barriers.  4\n Hiring people: I before T.In any case, many graduate schools and resume reviewers tend to  ignorethe breadth of a person\u2019s skills, focusing instead only on the depth. Bytaking the scientific output, in conjunction with maybe some relevantcoursework, as the be-all and end-all, any other skills tend tobe missed. At best, it might raise an eyebrow or two in magnanimoussurprise: falling prey to precisely the issue I describe in this post,I noticed myself doing this for candidates that already convinced mebecause of their academic track record! At worst, additional skillsmight be considered detrimental upon review, because a T-shaped personmay have a smaller number of papers than others.  5\n This is a  problem for machine learning research. Given theaforementioned fast pace in the field, excellent research necessitatesmoving away from silos! There will of course always be a demand forpeople that have deep domain expertise, but many facets of contemporaryresearch can be addressed just as well by a T-shaped person, in myexperience.\n Ts as multipliers.Throughout my career, the most impactful projects always had a T-shapedperson onboard. This person would usually not be an expert in thesubject matter, but would be able to provide the direly-needed scaffolding and foundation of a project that is all too often ignoredin the initial phase, until it comes back later on with full swing towreak havoc. This includes, for instance:\n  In my experience, these skills\u2014and others\u2014are not commonly considered when hiringsomeone. And to some extent, having fallen into the same trap, I fullyunderstand this! Paraphrasing  Leonard McCoy in Star Trek,we want to state \u2018I\u2019m a researcher, not a(n) $X$,\u2019 with $X \\in$ $\\{$softwaredeveloper, designer, marketing person, artist, $\\dots\\}$\n Progress in our interdisciplinary times, however, also requires peoplethat are sufficiently skilled to tackle these  other tasks. Even thoughsuch tasks might seemingly be unrelated to the overall scientific goalof creating new knowledge, they are still a fundamental part of themodern process of scientific inquiry.\n What to do now? I am writing this post because I detected aninconsistency in my personal observations and my actions: virtually allthe projects that contained a good mix of I-shaped and T-shaped personssucceeded extraordinarily well. Yet, upon recruiting my own team,I started to prefer I-shaped profiles over T-shaped ones, instead ofstriving for a solid balance. I caught myself in time and willsubsequently pay more attention to this bias of mine\u2014I hope thatothers will do the same!\n Machine learning and academia in general are enriched by teamscomprising diverse backgrounds and personalities. We should strive toachieve this.\n (In case more incentives are needed: the largest groups and researchdivisions are already doing this\u2014they are hiring not only for academicoutput, but also based on general software skills, for instance. If it\u2019sgood enough for them, it should certainly be good enough for the rest ofus.)\n  There is a veritable zoo of characters of the alphabet, trying tocapture the elusive properties of people out there in the realworld. It should be understood that I do not even for a second thinkthat one pithy letter is sufficient to describe a real person;all of these characterisations are merely hinting towards certainproperties. As always in real life, there are many different shadeson a spectrum to consider here.\u00a0 \u21a9\ufe0e\n My views pertain only to jobs that have a distinct softwaredevelopment component. I lack personal experience about other typesof jobs and would love to learn more about them.\u00a0 \u21a9\ufe0e\n Over time, one might think that a T-shaped person thus turns intoa comb-like pattern. As far as I understand, this has not beenstudied yet by ethnographers. Maybe the term \u2018serial experts\u2019 wouldalso been appropriate, except for its unfortunate similarity to thecriminal world.\u00a0 \u21a9\ufe0e\n I realise that this question is slightly off-topic, so I willdefer it to a future blog post.\u00a0 \u21a9\ufe0e\n I have even seen the term  unfocused being thrown around inreviews of candidates. Notice that this happened  prior to aninterview, so there is really no basis to judge their focus!\u00a0 \u21a9\ufe0e", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:20:18", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5f62\u4eba,people", "title": "T\u5f62\u4eba\u548c\u5b66\u672f\u754c", "title_en": "T-Shaped People and Academia", "transed": 1, "url": "https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2022/t/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5f62\u4eba", "people"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "97b3d2ac5d71c176f3a40244abe5d0b4.png", "infoid": 1072493, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b87\u822a\u5c40\u7684\u8a79\u59c6\u65af\u97e6\u4f2f\u592a\u7a7a\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u56e2\u961f\u5b8c\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8621\u82f1\u5c3a\uff0c\u9540\u91d1\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u955c\u5b50\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u4e3b\u8981\u822a\u5929\u5668\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6700\u540e\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u8fd0\u8425\u505a\u51c6\u5907\u3002", "note_en": "NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope team fully deployed its 21-foot, gold-coated primary mirror, successfully completing the final stage of all major spacecraft deployments to prepare for science operations.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:19:52", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "james,webb,\u79d1\u5b66", "title": "James WebB\u5b8c\u5168\u90e8\u7f72", "title_en": "James Webb is fully deployed", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-webb-telescope-reaches-major-milestone-as-mirror-unfolds", "via": "", "real_tags": ["james", "webb", "\u79d1\u5b66"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "eb03cfaab497f79211105a06473d2e1c.jpg", "infoid": 1072492, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u519c\u6c11\u53d7\u5230\u8f83\u5c11\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u571f\u5730\u548c\u719f\u7ec3\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u7684\u6311\u6218\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u7ea6\u7ff0\u00b7\u8fea\u5c14\u6b63\u5728\u54cd\u5e94\u5176\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u76848R\u62d6\u62c9\u673a\u3002\u57282022\u4e2a\u6d88\u8d39\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u6f14\u4e2d\u4eae\u76f8\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u4e868R\u62d6\u62c9\u673a\uff0c\u542f\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u51ff\u5b50\u7281\uff0cGPS\u5f15\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5148\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\u3002 \u201c\u9884\u8ba1\u5168\u7403\u4eba\u53e3\u5c06\u4ece2050\u5e74\u589e\u52a0\u523080\u4ebf\u5230\u8fd110\u4ebf\u4eba\u53e3\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5168\u7403\u7cae\u98df\u9700\u6c4250\uff05\uff0c\u201dJohn Deere\u7684\u9996\u5e2d\u6280\u672f\u5b98Jahmy Hindman\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u519c\u6c11\u8fd8\u5fc5\u987b\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5982\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5929\u6c14\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u571f\u58e4\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ba1\u7406\u6742\u8349\u548c\u5bb3\u866b\u7684\u53d8\u5316 - \u6240\u6709\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90fd\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5230\u4e00\u5e74\u4e2d\u6279\u8bc4\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u519c\u573a\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u201d\u914d\u5907\u516d\u5bf9\u7acb\u4f53\u58f0\u76f8\u673a\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0360\u00b0\u969c\u788d\u7269\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u8fc7\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u8be5\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u7ea6100\u6beb\u79d2\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u50cf\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u8fd9\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u662f\u5426\u7ee7\u7eed\u6216\u505c\u6b62\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5668\u8fde\u7eed\u68c0\u67e5\u5176\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5730\u7406\u6e90\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u5728\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u4e8e\u4e00\u82f1\u5bf8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002 \u201c\u81ea\u52a88R\u62d6\u62c9\u673a\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e09\u5e74\u5185\u5728\u73b0\u573a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u671f\u95f4\u6536\u96c6\u4e865000\u591a\u4e07\u5f20\u56fe\u7247\uff0c\u201dJohn Deere\u7684vply Pell\uff0cVP\u81ea\u6cbb\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u8bf4\u3002", "note_en": "In a time when farmers are challenged to produce more with less available land and skilled labor, John Deere is responding with its fully autonomous 8R tractor. Unveiled at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show, the machine combines the 8R tractor, a TruSet-enabled chisel plow, a GPS guidance system, and advanced technologies. \u00a0 \u201cThe global population is expected to grow from about 8 billion to nearly 10 billion people by 2050, increasing global food demand by 50%,\u201d says Jahmy Hindman, chief technology officer at John Deere. \u201cFarmers must also work through the variables like changing weather conditions, variations in soil quality, and managing weeds and pests \u2013 all of which impact the ability to farm during critical times of the year.\u201d  Equipped with six pairs of stereo cameras that enable 360\u00b0 obstacle detection and distance calculation, the images are passed through a network that classifies each pixel in about 100 milliseconds. This determines whether the machine continues or stops. In addition, the machine continuously checks its position relative to a geofence to ensure it is operating where it is supposed to, within less than an inch of accuracy. \t\u00a0 \t\u201cThe autonomous 8R tractor collected more than 50 million images during in-field testing for the last three years,\u201d says Willy Pell, VP autonomy and new ventures at John Deere.\n   Once transported to the field, a farmer configures the machine for autonomous operation. Using the John Deere Operations Center mobile app, a simple swipe starts the autonomous tractor. While it works, a farmer can leave the field to focus on other tasks, yet still monitor the machine remotely from a mobile device.

It also supports RemNote, IdeaFlow, Mem, and Notion, and adding additional systems isn\u2019t too difficult.\n One of the usability perks of Go Note Go is that there is no monitor. This means you can\u2019t get distracted browsing the internet while writing on Go Note Go. You also can\u2019t get distracted wordsmithing your own writing. It makes writing pleasurable, even if it comes at the cost of having typos and stray thoughts in your writing; you can always clean those up later.\n Go Note Go does a lot more, so I do encourage you to  learn more about it, but it isn\u2019t the focus of this post, which is about sending messages.For the purposes of this post, Go Note Go is a data entry system for Roam. And since I\u2019ve also built a system that allows sending messages directly from Roam, this means I can now send messages directly from Go Note Go. So, I can send messages when driving, camping, and as I drift off to sleep at night.\n To send a message in Go Note Go, you simply \u201c@\u201d the person you are writing to. To send a message to Adriana, I would write \u201c@Adriana Message goes here\u201d. To send a message to David Dohan (using first and last name), I could write \u201c@David Dohan: Message goes here\u201d. You can @ someone at any point in the message. You can also @ multiple people, and Messager will send them a group message.\n Go Note Go acts as an outliner now too; this is both a big usability improvement for Go Note Go on it\u2019s own, and doubly so for using Go Note Go as a messager. An \u201coutliner\u201d is a system for taking notes as a series of nested bullets. You can push tab to indent notes underneath other notes; I\u2019ve developed a user experience that makes this moderately natural, even in the absence of a monitor or any other visual feedback. For sending messages, the outliner feature is a boon. Any notes you nest under an @\u2019d note will also register as additional messages for the @\u2019d recipients. This makes writing longer multiline messages a pleasure, even without a monitor.\n The default behavior of my messaging system is to hold the messages for approval before sending them. So, the messages that I write as I drift off to sleep don\u2019t send as I drift off to sleep. Instead, I see them in the morning and approve them, and only upon being approved are they sent automatically.\n This delayed-approve-then-send approach is particularly well suited for Go Note Go, where I likely make typos and want to clean up the messages before they are sent, since I am writing them without a monitor. Later in the post I\u2019ll dive into what the approval process looks like (tl;dr there\u2019s a spreadsheet where I can mark a message as \u201cOK\u201d to send), but first I want to share additional benefits of being able to send messages directly from my note-taking app, which is currently Roam Research.\n  Anything I write on my Go Note Go appears in Roam Research, but I can also take notes directly in Roam.Just like on Go Note Go, the way to draft a message in Roam is to \u201c@\u201d the person you are writing to.Messager has some heuristics it uses to translate your @\u2019s into proper recipients.So, the syntax for @\u2018ing someone isn\u2019t too strict.\n Using Roam offers some possibilities beyond what I can do on Go Note Go, such as including images in messages.Like on Go Note Go, you can use nested bullets to create longer messages,and you can @ as many people as you want for a message.In Roam, however, you can also include images in your messages.Messager will intelligently send those in the native format used by the underlying messaging service,rather than blindly sending the markdown stored in Roam.I find this feature, being able to use images naturally in Roam, and then have them send naturally as messages,quite pleasant.\n One future direction I\u2019d like for this project is to add a \u201csend\u201d button in Roam next to any messages I\u2019ve drafted there,as well as to display the status of the messages inline in my notes. That\u2019s not implemented now, but would be a nice-to-have for the future.\n Today, all messages are automatically added to my \u201cmessager queue\u201d where they wait for approval before being sent.I like having this approve-before-sending approach as the default, since it psychologically frees me up to write things I might not otherwise write if I was instead using a send button that sent immediately.However, sometimes being able to send something immediately is desirable, and that\u2019s not a clean option in the current setup.\n  Any messages in Roam (whether entered directly into Roam, or entered via Go Note Go), are automatically added to a spreadsheet, the \u201cMessager Queue\u201d. These are the spreadsheet\u2019s columns:\n  The Messager Queue sheet is filtered by default to show all pending messages. For each message it shows the  Service on which it will be sent and well as the  Recipient of the message. The service can be one of FB Messenger, Twitter, iMessage, a Slack server, or Discord. The recipient can either be an individual, a list of individuals, a group, a Slack channel, or a Discord server and channel.\n There\u2019s also a sheet that lists aliases, so it\u2019s easy to use a short name or informal name to refer to a longer service or recipient; e.g. I use \u201c@Audio Tools\u201d as a shorthand for sending to a group of 5 people on Messenger all interested in audio tools for networked thought.\n The Messager Queue sheet also displays the  Text of the message to send, so you can easily clean up the message here for any typos or clarifications before it is sent.\n The  Date and  Time columns allow for scheduling messages to be sent at any point in the future. Leave them blank and the message will be sent as soon as it is approved. Use keyboard shortcuts cmd-; (for date) and cmd-shift-; (for time) to quickly fill out these columns if desired.\n Finally, the  Approval column is the most important. Mark a messages as OK if you want it to be sent, or as Ignored if you deside to skip it. The  Status column is updated automatically by Messager when the message is sent (or if it fails to send, then the error appears here). You can also mark the Status manually with whatever value you want (e.g. if you send the message manually), and the Messager system will ignore that message going forward. If you want the system to retry sending a message, simply clear out the Status column and it will try again.\n I include this spreadsheet as a custom service in  Ferdi, so it lives alongside all the messaging apps I use. (This in itself might be the subject of a future  snippet.)\n  Beyond allowing me to catch a bunch of typos, it\u2019s also a psychologically useful thing for me.I am more willing to write and I feel able to say more things that I might not otherwise,knowing I have the opportunity to cancel or change the message later.In that way, it\u2019s like gmail\u2019s undo feature. In gmail, undo not a true undo, but having those 30 seconds after clicking send to retract the message make a big difference.\n Another benefit of sending the messages only after approving them is the ability to sleep at night. If I write a message at night, I know you haven\u2019t responded yet because my messages haven\u2019t even sent yet; they\u2019ll go out in the morning, after I\u2019ve had a chance to clean them up. So, I don\u2019t spend any mental effort wondering if there\u2019s a response from you. It also allows me to set the appropriate tone for the messages, by having them go out at a reasonable time, rather than appearing urgent by being sent in the middle of the night. And it does this without me needing to keep the message draft in my head as I sleep. So, I sleep better.\n This is why, while the ability to send messages immediately would also be a good feature to add, I am inclined to leave approve-in-the-morning messages as the system\u2019s default behavior.\n  One additional small usability feature is that Bieber Bot will message me in the morning or evening whenever there are messages in the Messager Queue awaiting my approval.\n This sounds like a small convenience, and in fact has proven even more useful than it might at first sound.When I wake up in the morning, I sometimes don\u2019t remember that I\u2019ve written messages the preceding night.So, having Bieber Bot send me the link to the Messager Queue and gently remind me to approve the messages has beenconsistently charming and welcome. Thanks, Bieber Bot.\n  Messager is the underlying system that sends the messages in the Messager Queue system.As noted previously, it supportsFacebook Messenger, Twitter,Slack, Discord, and iMessage.It also supports Hacker News, which hasn\u2019t been so useful for this project.And I am thinking I may add gChat and email support next.\n I use Messager for more than just sending messages from the Messager Queue spreadsheet;it also backs other projects like my  Kangaroo Auto-responder and  several parts of Bieber Bot.Its purpose, in the most broad sense, is to support programmatically sending and receiving messages in a uniform manner across all the messaging systems I use.\n For Facebook Messager, it uses  fbchat to enable programmatically sending and receiving messages as myself. It also uses Facebook\u2019s API to allow sending messages as Bieber Bot.\n For Twitter, it uses the API to support public tweets, private tweets (using a separate account;  see here for how I use this to reclaim my attention), and DMs.\n  Slack and Discord are the most recent additions, and they currently live outside the core Messager system;they are implemented using Browserflow flows.This means that I am effectively sending Slack and Discord messages as myself, rather than using an API to do so.The messages are sent in a browser using clicks and keyboard presses,all in the same human-centric UI that I would use if I were to send the messages manually.I\u2019m so grateful to Browserflow for making this possible, as Slack and Discord have been really key additions to this project.\n  I\u2019ve been using the setup for only a few days so far, and am continuing to actively develop it.So far, I absolutely love it.\n The headless typing experience provided by Go Note Go makes for a great environment for drafting messages.So too does using Roam Research while scrolling through social media. (I\u2019m the sort of person who doesn\u2019t usually like replying publicly to social media posts, but does enjoy engaging with them in 1:1 or small group chat messages.)Drifting off to sleep has proven to be another excellent time to share thoughts with friends.I don\u2019t want to start  a conversation with friends as I drift off to sleep, but loads of thoughts come to mind that I do want to share with people, and so adding them to my Messager Queue to send the next day has been quite satisfying.\n If this interests you, feel free to get in touch.If you do, I\u2019ll do my best to get back to you, likely as I\u2019m drifting off to sleep.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:19:00", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "Respected cryptographer Moxie Marlinspike has written up  some thoughts on Ethereum and the modern \u2018crypto\u2019 ecosystem. Although I was involved in Bitcoin right at the beginning, I\u2019ve never been involved in Ethereum or Web3, don\u2019t currently own any cryptocurrencies and I broadly agree with a lot of what he says. Nonetheless I disagree on a few critical points. In this essay I\u2019ll summarize parts of Moxie\u2019s argument, lay out a couple of disagreements and then provide some suggestions for a path forward.\n  I\u2019ll start with a small technical disagreement before moving onto thoughts about servers and cryptography.\n At the core of Moxie\u2019s argument is the observation that Ethereum claims to be a decentralized ecosystem but isn\u2019t. This is broadly true. He also observes that there are many excuses for this situation in circulation like \u201cit\u2019s early days\u201d which, as someone who used Bitcoin in 2009, seems quite wrong. 12 years is sufficient to have solved these problems.\n  When people talk about blockchains, they talk about distributed trust, leaderless consensus, and all the mechanics of how that works, but often gloss over the reality that clients ultimately can\u2019t participate in those mechanics. All the network diagrams are of servers, the trust model is between servers, everything is about servers.  Blockchains are designed to be a network of peers, but not designed such that it\u2019s really possible for your mobile device or your browser to be one of those peers.\n With the shift to mobile, we now live firmly in a world of clients and servers \u2014 with the former completely unable to act as the latter \u2014 and those questions seem more important to me than ever. Meanwhile, ethereum actually refers to servers as \u201cclients,\u201d so  there\u2019s  not even a word for an actual untrusted client/server interface that will have to exist somewhere, and no acknowledgement that if successful there will ultimately be billions (!) more clients than servers\n I feel a need to respond to this because it\u2019s only actually true for Ethereum. I should know because my first project when I joined the Bitcoin world was to work with Andreas Schildbach on a genuinely peer-to-peer mobile wallet app, which became  Bitcoin Wallet for Android. It had/has a competitive UX and was able to grow a large userbase, despite being built in the most decentralized way possible.\n  We could do this because Satoshi thought  very carefully about the untrusted client/server interface. From day one the Bitcoin protocol had a notion of a sort of lightweight client mode. Satoshi didn\u2019t give this mode a clear name but the section of the paper that discussed it was titled \u201cSimplified payment verification\u201d, so I started calling apps that used it SPV wallets and the name stuck. Exactly how SPV mode works is fully explained elsewhere, but briefly, the client app bootstraps connections to the P2P network as normal but sends a special message saying \u201cplease don\u2019t send me the contents of every block or transaction, I only want to see transactions matching a filter\u201d. It then downloads the  headers of every block from the peers, but not their contents, and does the necessary computations to select the block header chain with the highest total work. Transactions that match the filter come supplied with a Merkle branch linking them to the Merkle tree roots embedded into the headers. In this way a client can traverse a chain of blocks with fairly minimal bandwidth, storage and CPU requirements, whilst keeping the P2P network as an untrusted adversary. The filter in our implementation was a Bloom filter, so you could probabilistically hide what you were interested in (although in practice, real users cared much more about performance than this type of privacy).\n  One of the surprising things to me about web3, despite being built on \u201ccrypto,\u201d is how little cryptography seems to be involved!\n I think the protocol just outlined does use cryptography in some interesting ways, or rather, ways that were interestingly new in 2011 when we built out the infrastructure.\n This system was very complicated to implement but worked surprisingly well. We implemented lots of performance tricks like background wakeups to keep roughly synced, bandwidth adaptation, measuring peer latencies, syncing at night when plugged in to charge and so on. Whilst SPV wallets were never  quite as fast as competitors that simply polled a centralized database, they were  fast enough for many users.\n  That was then. This is now. Why doesn\u2019t Ethereum have SPV clients like Bitcoin did? Well, simply put it wasn\u2019t designed with resource consumption in mind (nor, frankly, ordinary commerce). A Bitcoin implementation not only controls how much work it does via SPV mode but can also parallelize and shard a lot of full-mode work to get great scalability. This is possible due to the way the contents of the blocks are designed. Ethereum kept the chain-of-blocks idea from Bitcoin but radically changed what those blocks had inside them, and in the process not only lost the ability to have mobile clients but also destroyed its own ability to scale through parallelism.\n Unfortunately a frequent problem in the crypto/blockchain space is what Moxie is doing here: conflating Ethereum, Bitcoin and the block chain algorithm together, leading to incorrect conclusions like \u201cblockchains don\u2019t scale well\u201d or \u201cblockchains can\u2019t have mobile clients\u201d when the truth was closer to \u201cEthereum can\u2019t do those things\u201d. (It can of course do many other things Bitcoin couldn\u2019t). If the question you\u2019re interested in is \u201cwhat\u2019s up with NFTs?\u201d then this distinction hardly matters, because after  the Bitcoin community drank the kool-aid it collapsed as a medium of exchange \u2014 nowadays I see no more opportunities to buy and sell things with Bitcoin than I did a decade ago. The momentum and interest moved to Ethereum. But if the question you\u2019re interested in is \u201chow do I build decentralized, privacy preserving systems\u201d, then the distinction does still matter.\n  The above argument is a bit nit-picky, so now I want to make a much bolder disagreement.\n Through his work on Signal and WhatsApp, Moxie is the primary advocate for what I\u2019d call centralized cryptography. He sums up his position well so I\u2019ll just quote it here:\n We should accept the premise that people will not run their own servers by designing systems that can distribute trust without having to distribute infrastructure. This means architecture that anticipates and accepts the inevitable outcome of relatively centralized client/server relationships, but uses cryptography (rather than infrastructure) to distribute trust.\n After 30+ years, email is still unencrypted; meanwhile  WhatsApp went from unencrypted to full e2ee in a year\n I agree with points 1 and 2, but there\u2019s a conceptual problem with the argument: cryptography cannot impose any limits on an adversary that also controls the client doing the encryption. Centralized infrastructure that uses cryptography to defeat the centralized infrastructure is a contradiction in terms that can never work.\n Let\u2019s put it less abstractly. Moxie claims that Signal and WhatsApp use end to end encryption to ensure they can\u2019t read our messages. How do we know this claim is true? I have nothing against Moxie and have never seen any evidence he\u2019s untrustworthy, but I also assign zero weight to this belief because WhatsApp could be silently changed tomorrow to disable that technology for one or more users, without anyone even noticing, including Moxie himself. As for Signal it\u2019s at least open source, but there\u2019s no way to check that the client I\u2019m using, or my friend is using, actually matches that source code. Even if there was it\u2019s irrelevant. Centralized infrastructure can claim to provide privacy but can never provide control: they can openly alter the deal at any time and I\u2019d be forced to continue using it, if I couldn\u2019t get my friends to switch to something else.\n This is not a theoretical argument. Disabling E2E encryption has  already happened, although hardly anyone knows about it. In 2019 WhatsApp  imposed forwarding limits on messages in order to \u201c slow down the spread of rumors, viral messages, and fake news\u201d. This represents a total defeat of the Signal protocol\u2019s cryptographic objectives: a basic goal of any modern cryptographic scheme is to ensure the same message encrypted twice doesn\u2019t encrypt to the same bytes. The point of this is to stop the adversary knowing when you\u2019re repeatedly sending the same message and encryption modes that get this wrong (like AES/ECB)  are discredited. Yet once Facebook \u2014 the adversary \u2014 became dominated by authoritarians who see unlimited communication as chaotic, they simply changed the client to include a forwarding counter outside the encrypted part of the message. There was nothing anyone could do about this. It just showed up one day, and all the fancy mathematics designed to stop this \u201cattack\u201d were irrelevant.\n  If an encryption scheme can\u2019t stop infrastructure providers having opinions on the moral value of messages, what\u2019s the point of it?\n Thus despite my respect for what Moxie has designed and accomplished, I have problems with pushing the Signal/WhatsApp approach as something that can provide privacy, decentralized control or even as something that has any effect at all. It is  at best a building block for later work that could meet these goals and it probably does act as a brake on Facebook\u2019s worst tendencies, so it\u2019s not nothing, but it\u2019s also not a robust foundation. Really, a simple blog post that says \u201cwe promise we don\u2019t log messages to disk\u201d should carry equal weight.\n These are big problems. We don\u2019t want people to lose trust in concepts like encryption, privacy or decentralization yet:\n    Firstly let\u2019s look at mobile messengers. There should be a quick incremental improvement here that would let them keep some central control whilst providing meaningful guarantees to their users: threshold signatures. Mobile operating systems check the signatures on app packages before applying updates. These are normal ECDSA or RSA signatures. It\u2019s possible to craft such signatures not from a single private key but from a group effort by the holders of several key \u2018shards\u2019. By splitting up their signing key and distributing the shards to a variety of auditing firms with access to the source code, updates can be approved by the group. If the firms are spread around the world and their contracts are public, this can be used to translate arbitrary natural language rules into a binary signed/not signed decision legible by Android/iOS app update engines.\n This isn\u2019t a total fix, because ultimately the audit firms would need to be paid (they have to check the source matches the social contract being advertised), and thus the central authority \u2014 our adversary \u2014 will be the ones picking the auditors. But it\u2019s still a big step up and would mean that if Facebook suddenly decided merely blocking forwarding isn\u2019t enough to fight \u201crumors\u201d or \u201cfake news\u201d, they\u2019d be stopped by the auditors who\u2019d (hopefully) refuse to sign the update that takes out the encryption.\n The downside to the app developer is relatively small \u2014 higher latency on pushing out updates, dollar cost \u2014 but it\u2019d be transparent to end users and wouldn\u2019t affect the UX which is what they prize most. They could continue to iterate on the app quickly and without needing to move an ecosystem.\n  Threshold signing with distributed audit would be a nice upgrade, but what about more conventional approaches? It seems like privacy is impossible without control, control is difficult without decentralization, but our attempts to build decentralized systems aren\u2019t working. What can be done?\n Let\u2019s take a step back and re-examine some of our foundational assumptions. Moxie argues:\n  The first clause is certainly true. The second is a prediction about the future, which is a notoriously difficult thing to predict.\n Is the reluctance to run servers  fundamental or is it merely  the way things are now? Why don\u2019t non technical users want to run servers? After all, they have done in the past via programs like BitTorrent and Gnutella. Multiplayer games are often also servers for latency reasons, relying on a central meeting point only for matchmaking. AirDrop runs a server in order to work. Etc.\n  The dominant server OS is some mix of Linux, AWS, Kubernetes, Apache/Nginx etc. This stack has horrific usability even for experts. Consider how awkward it is to configure working backups for a new Linux server \u2014 this is a  basic task which should be easy, yet it\u2019s not.\n But these things are all attributes of our current infrastructure, not things that must universally be true. The \u2018golden age\u2019 of home servers like BitTorrent nodes, web servers running in people\u2019s bedrooms etc was a few years after the millennium, when:\n  Clearly then, the factors that constrain self-run decentralized infrastructure today don\u2019t  have to be true, they are true because we don\u2019t make them false. An entirely different world is imaginable.\n It\u2019s worth noting here that despite widespread industry groupthink of the form \u201ceverything should be a web app\u201d (hence the gratuitously named Web3), Apple \u2014 the company most strongly associated with tech usability \u2014 is not really on board with the whole web/cloud trend. They implement everything as an app that runs locally on powerful and expensive hardware, where your data is fully under your control. Especially on macOS, you share as much or as little of it with Apple as you want. You can reject software updates, or accept them. You back up data to a \u201c time capsule\u201d, easily and locally. You can monitor what apps can do or send on the network. In many ways it\u2019s a traditional mindset reflecting the values of the 90s, yet it has  not held Apple back in any way in its competition with the drastically more centralized ChromeOS. I\u2019m not saying Apple is some paragon of decentralization, as obviously they aren\u2019t and the fact it\u2019s worked out this way is mostly due to their history rather than any strong pro-liberty philosophical stance. But still. They\u2019re an existence proof of what\u2019s technically possible.\n Thus I conclude it\u2019s not actually a given that users won\u2019t run their own infrastructure, or adopt more decentralized approaches. They don\u2019t do that  today because the software industry outside of Cupertino isn\u2019t interested in easily letting them do that. Linux distros in particular have failed to make a highly usable system, even for their own kind of people. And regardless of how much companies like Google or Facebook talk about privacy, their culture is and always will be to immediately leap for \u201cdo it all on the server\u201d, which of course Apple knows and fully exploits in their marketing.\n I\u2019m painting with a very broad brush here and there are exceptions \u2014 the trend towards running ML models on-device is a good and praiseworthy example of this. But I hope you\u2019ll agree that the generalities are right.\n  I\u2019ve been thinking about these problems for a long time. These days I\u2019m focused on finding incremental, non-radical paths forward. No more peer-to-peer networks for me, at least not for a while.\n  We should try to reduce the burden of building software. At this point, software projects require an enormous amount of human effort. Even relatively simple apps require a group of people to sit in front of a computer for eight hours a day, every day, forever. This wasn\u2019t always the case, and there was a time when 50 people working on a software project wasn\u2019t considered a \u201csmall team.\u201d\n I completely agree. Top of my list: it should be  way easier to build and distribute both desktop apps and small, one-machine servers. Far better than encryption is just not sending data to another place to begin with, and it\u2019s possible far more frequently than we actually exploit. Apple can make ultra-competitive yet private and decentralized \u2018experiences\u2019 like Pages, Numbers, GarageBand etc because of their deep history of building electronics, client-side software and distribution/supply chains. Yet the iLife apps stay up to date because Apple built their own app store infrastructure and OS to ensure they do. Other parts of the software industry struggle with even these basics.\n Step 1 for building a decentralized system: get code onto the powerful, high bandwidth devices users actually plug into AC power today, keep it up to date and for political reasons do it  outside of app stores. Ethereum has totally failed at this and Moxie is right to point that out. But the reason they failed is obvious once you actually try to do it: it\u2019s a universe of pain. Awkward, hacked together and  frequently abandoned tools, poor software update systems, numerous package and installer formats, and even needing to render icons at lots of different sizes all slows you down.\n I spent most of 2021 working on software that addresses all these problems. It lets you make self-updating desktop and server apps with only a small config file and a single command. It\u2019s not quite ready for beta yet and I didn\u2019t actually set out to write an advert for what I\u2019m doing when I started this essay, thus currently there\u2019s no website or mailing list for this project. You\u2019ll just have to keep an eye on my blog. I\u2019ll announce it here when it\u2019s launched, so subscribe for updates if you\u2019re interested.\n  It\u2019s a tool, not a service. You run it locally on whatever type of computer you have, and it can make fully signed and notarized downloads for Windows, Mac and Linux without needing you to own those operating systems.\n The apps stay fresh. Online updates are easy, just change the version in the config file, rebuild and re-upload the generated static files to a web server. You don\u2019t have to sacrifice iteration speed and the update tech is the most \u2018native\u2019 on each platform (MSIX on Windows, Sparkle on macOS, package managers on Linux).\n The user can be empowered. As long as you allow it, users can review and reject upgrades e.g. because they\u2019re about to give a presentation and don\u2019t want their setup changing, or they don\u2019t like the new UI etc. Or you can ensure apps always update silently Chrome style: useful in enterprise deployments or where there\u2019s a rapidly changing client/server protocol. Pick what makes most sense for your target market.\n Generates Linux server packages. Again, from any OS. They use systemd, can be sandboxed, can depend on other packages like databases, start automatically on install/boot, handle upgrades at the right times etc.\n Apps distributed this way don\u2019t have to be peer to peer apps. Simple GUI frontends to centralized services like WhatsApp Web also get easier to make. But once you\u2019re on the desktop (or a Linux server) you have way more options and available tradeoffs on the decentralization/control/privacy/usability spectrum. The first versions of this tool won\u2019t support threshold signed updates for example, but it\u2019s a feature we\u2019d really like to find time for.\n I\u2019m excited to launch this product and the company behind it, because I think that really nailing the basics is a key step towards solving some of the problems Moxie identified. Make it easy for developers to do the right thing, and more of us will do it.

CAMELS \u2014 which stands for Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations \u2014 aims to use those simulations  to train artificial intelligence models to decipher the universe\u2019s properties.\n Scientists are already using the data,  which is free to download, to power new research, says project co-leader Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro, a research scientist with the Simons Foundation\u2019s CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) Analysis and Simulation group.\n Villaescusa-Navarro leads the project with associate research scientists at the Flatiron Institute\u2019s Center for Computational Astrophysics (CCA) Shy Genel and  Daniel Angl\u00e9s-Alc\u00e1zar, who is also a UConn Associate Professor of Physics.\n \u201cMachine learning is revolutionizing many areas of science, but it requires a huge amount of data to exploit,\u201d says Angl\u00e9s-Alc\u00e1zar. \u201cThe CAMELS public data release, with thousands of simulated universes covering a broad range of plausible physics, will provide the galaxy formation and cosmology communities with a unique opportunity to explore the potential of new machine-learning algorithms to solve a variety of problems.\u201d\n  The CAMELS team generated the simulations using code taken from the  IllustrisTNG and  Simba projects. The CAMELS team includes members of both projects, with Genel a part of the core team of IllustrisTNG and Angl\u00e9s-Alc\u00e1zar on the team that developed Simba.\n About half of the simulations combine the physics of the cosmos with the smaller-scale physics essential for galaxy formation. Each simulation is run with slightly different assumptions about the universe \u2014 for instance, regarding how much of the universe is invisible dark matter versus the dark energy pulling the cosmos apart, or how much energy supermassive black holes inject into the space between galaxies.\n The researchers designed the simulations to feed machine-learning models, which will then be able to extract information from observations of the real, observable universe. With 4,233 universe simulations, CAMELS is the largest ever suite of detailed cosmological simulations designed to train machine-learning algorithms.\n \u201cThe data will enable new discoveries and connect cosmology with astrophysics through machine learning,\u201d says Villaescusa-Navarro. \u201cThere has never been anything similar to this, with this many universe simulations.\u201d\n The CAMELS dataset is already powering research projects, with a wide range of papers utilizing the data in the works.\n Pablo Villanueva-Domingo of the University of Valencia in Spain led  one such paper. He and his colleagues leveraged the CAMELS simulations to train an artificial intelligence model to measure the mass of our Milky Way galaxy plus its surrounding dark matter halo, and the nearby Andromeda galaxy and its halo. The measurements \u2014 the first ever done using AI \u2014 put our galaxy\u2019s heft at 1 trillion to 2.6 trillion times the sun\u2019s mass. Those estimates are roughly in line with those made by other methods, demonstrating the AI approach\u2019s accuracy.\n Meanwhile, Villaescusa-Navarro headed an effort to use the CAMELS data to estimate the value of two parameters that govern the fundamental properties of the universe: what fraction of the universe is matter, and how evenly mass is distributed throughout the cosmos. First, he and his colleagues used CAMELS to generate maps such as the distribution of dark matter, gas and different properties of stars. Then, using the maps, they trained a machine-learning tool called a neural network to predict the values of the two parameters.\n \u201cThis is the same kind of algorithm used to tell the difference between a cat and a dog from the pixels of an image,\u201d says Genel, who co-authored the paper. \u201cThe human eye can\u2019t determine how much dark matter there is in a simulation, but a neural network can do that.\u201d\n The results showed the promise of leveraging CAMELS to precisely estimate such parameters in the future based on new observations of the universe, says Villaescusa-Navarro.\n \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see what other new discoveries this will enable,\u201d he says.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:17:47", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4e0b\u8f7d,\u514d\u8d39,\u57f9\u8bad,suite,\u6a21\u62df", "title": "\u6700\u5927\u7684AI\u57f9\u8bad\u5b87\u5b99\u6a21\u62df\u5957\u4ef6\u73b0\u5728\u53ef\u4ee5\u514d\u8d39\u4e0b\u8f7d", "title_en": "The Largest Suite of Cosmic Simulations for AI Training Is Now Free to Download", "transed": 1, "url": "https://today.uconn.edu/2022/01/the-largest-suite-of-cosmic-simulations-for-ai-training-is-now-free-to-download-already-spurring-discoveries/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4e0b\u8f7d", "\u514d\u8d39", "\u57f9\u8bad", "suite", "\u6a21\u62df"]}]
