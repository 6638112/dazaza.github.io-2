used to destruction, and they&#39;d be glad to send them along.\u00a0 About a dozen did show up which Tilden carefully dissected and used in a variety of first-generation research walkers.\u00a0 Walkman 1.5 was the most successful and certainly the most famous of the twelve-robot line, many of which were built concurrently over a 2 year period.\n    Knowing his Nervous Network control theory was robust enough to work anything, Tilden built his robots only from discarded components and in non-uniform ways to prove the point, and Walkman was no exception.\u00a0 The robot was built from a vast array of diverse components from the famous &#34;oven timer&#34; gearbox, Motorola phone vibrating motors, Walkman gearboxes and analog electronics, gold PCB test pins, and parts from old laser-printer cartridges, even the PCB the circuit was built on was scavenged from an 1980s Sun Microsystems video board.\u00a0 Indeed, there was nothing in the robot (as in the entire VBug series) that was not second hand.\u00a0 The entire robot was &#34;wire-framed&#34;, with solder as the primary structural element holding it together.\u00a0 Walkman and his brethren even garnered a Guinness World Record for &#34;World&#39;s Least Expensive Research Robot&#34; from 1997 to 2001.\n      Walkman standing on one of the extra walkmans donated by the reporters at the New York Times.\u00a0 The first Walkmans donated were used to build the robot itself.\n    Despite appearances nothing on Walkman was decorative -- sensors were all shaped to optimize object detection as the asymmetric robot explored, gold video-cable pins were used for contacts to optimize lifetime, even the aluminum backplate was used as a heat sink for the 240 bus driver chips (pushed well beyond their ratings as both motor drivers and multiplexers).\n    Walkman turned out to be the darling of Tilden and Hasslachers international lecture circuit from 1994 to 1999, showing how emergent competence could rise from simplicity (a stalwart of the Artificial Life movement during that time).\u00a0 During a lecture at the MIT Robotics Laboratory in 1995 the famous Marvin Minsky, after examining Walkman, put it down and exclaimed &#34;I don&#39;t know where you&#39;ve hidden the wireless modem link to the computer that&#39;s actually controlling this thing, but I know it has to be in there somewhere.&#34;\u00a0 Despite a long emotionally charged discussion afterwards, no opinions were changed despite experimental evidence and repeated tests.\n    In 1997 Walkman was taken to Washington DC for study and presentation by various science agencies to drum up funding interest in Biomorphic Robotics -- a &#34;new form&#34; of robotics that appeared capable but significantly less expensive than conventional methods.\u00a0 It was during this time that Walkman was found missing after a prominent presentation to congress having been lifted from a Capitol Hill exibition table without a trace.\u00a0 Walkman was gone for over 15 months until the fall of 1998 when it was returned to Tilden by a new DARPA Project manager who had &#34;found it&#34; along with various other Tilden robots in an Arlington Virginia government office.\u00a0 Several other robots were also returned that had been delivered to diverse sponsors over the years (of the original twelve VBug robots built, seven are still unaccounted for).\n    Walkman was very animated and quite enigmatic to watch.\u00a0 It showed an incredible exploration competence despite simplicity and even a demonstrable memory effect, being able to extract itself from any leg trap again using the same method it would &#34;find&#34; after only 30 seconds of flailing, and again almost immediately.\u00a0\u00a0 Though there was much study and papers written on Walkmans abilities, they were never properly described or explained, and Walkman&#39;s abilities remain a mystery until this day.\n                  The original Walkman 1.5 schematic showing the chips in the actual positions and their exact wiring allocations.\u00a0 The bottom 4 resistors in the middle set the tuning for the very asymmetric structure and took Tilden well over a day to optimize.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 13:00:37", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba,walkman", "title": "walkman a.k.a.vbug 1.5\u673a\u5668\u4eba ", "title_en": "The Walkman a.k.a.

However, this is no ordinary external  SSD as the   XTRM-Q packs a whopping 16TB of storage space.\n  The new drive actually features dual 8TB NVMe SSDs inside an enclosure for 16TB in total. The size of the enclosure isn&#39;t too big as you can probably make out from the image above. It measures 4.5&#34; long, 2.56&#34; wide, and 0.68&#34; high. In terms of build, its body is made of aluminum that makes it strong and also helps to dissipate heat. This is important if it works as well as the company says since SSDs are generally more heat-sensitive than HDDs. There is also a rubbery case on top for further protection.\n Now coming to the drive itself, each 8TB drive inside the enclosure can be run individually or you can run them in RAID 0 mode for a total of 16TB of storage. When running RAID 0 mode, the speed of the drive will double providing up to 2800MB/s. For speeds like this, a reasonably fast interface is necessary. For that, the Sabrent Rocket    XTRM-Q comes with support for Intel Thunderbolt 3. A Thunderbolt cable is included along with a power adapter,\n  The Sabrent Rocket     XTRM-Q 16TB launches at a price of $2,899.99 and is available for purchase  on Amazon&#39;s US website.\n The     XTRM-Q isn&#39;t the only large-sized SSD that Sabrent has been in news for as last year in December, the company said it was preparing a  SATA 16TB internal 2.5&#34; SSD.", "posttime": "2021-06-23

", "note_en": "Just before the long weekend at the end of May, Amazon announced the release of their   Sidewalk mesh network . There are many misconceptions about what it is and what it does, so this article will untangle some of the confusion.\n  Much of the press about Amazon Sidewalk has said that it will force you to share your internet or WiFi network. It won\u2019t. It\u2019s a network to connect home automation devices like smart light switches together in more flexible ways.\u00a0Amazon\u00a0is opening the network up to partners, the first of which is the Tile tracker.\n Sidewalk can use the internet for some features, but won\u2019t in general. If it does, Amazon is limiting its rate to 80 kilobits per second -- or 8 kilobytes per second, which is only about 50% more than the modems we used in the old days. It is also capped at 500 MB per month, which is less than two hours of 80 kbps over the whole month. To be clear: it isn\u2019t going to interfere with your streaming, video calls, or anything else. The   average web page is over two megabytes  in size, which would take over four minutes to download at that speed.\n  Sidewalk is primarily a mesh network for home automation devices, like Alexa\u2019s smart device features, Google Home, and Apple HomeKit. This mesh network can provide coverage where your home network is flaky. To build the ecosystem, people incorporate their devices into this mesh network.\n The first partner company to integrate to Sidewalk is the   Tile tracker tags . Sidewalk allows you to use a Tile tag at a distance further than typical Bluetooth range. Sidewalk uses Bluetooth, WiFi, and 900MHz radio to connect the mesh network together. There will be other partner companies; this is an important thing to understand about the Amazon Sidewalk mesh, that it\u2019s not just Amazon. Other companies will make devices that operate as entities in the network, either as a device like a smart light switch, or as a hub like the Echo and Ring devices.\n  Suppose you want to send a birthday card to Alice, I live next door to you, and you know I work with Alice. Rather than sending the card through the postal system, you might give me the card to take to Alice. When I get to work, I run into Bob who sits next to Alice, so I give the card to Bob, who gives it to Alice.\n That\u2019s a mesh network.\u00a0 A web of people delivers the message in an ad hoc manner, and saves you postage. Notably, mesh networks work without explicit infrastructure or servers.\n  Suppose you put an Alexa-controlled light in your bedroom, but the WiFi there is flaky. If you use Alexa to turn the light on or off, sometimes the command doesn\u2019t get through. Let\u2019s also suppose that in that bedroom, the WiFi from your neighbor\u2019s house is stronger than your WiFi. Well, what if when your WiFi doesn\u2019t process your command, your Alexa uses your neighbor\u2019s WiFi instead? That\u2019s what Amazon Sidewalk does, with a very simple mesh, from your Alexa to your neighbor\u2019s WiFi to your light.\n Let\u2019s expand on that example. Suppose that you\u2019re out on a walk in your neighborhood and realize you didn\u2019t turn your lamp off. You press a button on your smartphone to turn the lamp off. Your phone passes that message to a nearby house, perhaps the one across the street, which hands that message to another house, and it ends up at your lamp, in much the same way as your birthday card made its way to Alice.\n In some situations, Sidewalk won\u2019t be able to route the message via the mesh. Instead, it has to send the message to the internet, and then back from the internet to the mesh network near the destination.\n The Sidewalk documents we have seen do not have details of the mesh routing algorithms, such as how messages are routed via mesh and when or why they go into or out of the internet. So we don\u2019t know how that works. We do know that when Sidewalk tries to send messages without involving the internet, messages are expected to be small, and relatively infrequent, because the bandwidth throttle and total data caps are someone\u2019s \u201cnobody should need anywhere close to this\u201d limits. We don\u2019t know how hard it tries, nor how successful its tries are.\n  Amazon describes the privacy and security of Sidewalk in a   privacy and security whitepaper .\u00a0Amazon also\u00a0has\u00a0 an overview,\u00a0  a blog post about their goals ,   an IoT Integration site , and   developer documentation for the SDK .\n While it does not describe the details of the Sidewalk protocols, its description of the cryptographic security and privacy measures is promising. So is the sketch of the routing. It appears to have some good security and privacy protections. Of course, the proof is in the details and ultimate implementation. Amazon has a reasonable track record of designing, building, and updating security and privacy in AWS and related technologies. It\u2019s in their interest to severely limit what participants in the mesh network learn about other participants, and thus whatever leaks researchers find are likely to be bugs.\n    Most of the articles about Sidewalk focused on the network sharing, without explaining that this is a community mesh network of home automation and related technologies. Even more recent articles, which at least have stopped talking about   internet  sharing, are instead talking about   wireless  (WiFi) sharing. It\u2019s been difficult to understand what Sidewalk is and is not. At the end of our investigation, we don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve gotten it right, either. Amazon needs to do a much better job telling us what their new systems do.\n To be fair, this is hard! Mesh networking is not widely used for wireless communications because the technology is difficult to implement. Nonetheless, this is all the more reason for Amazon to spend more time describing what Sidewalk is.\n  Amazon has published some good overviews, white papers, and even some API descriptions, yet there is much that we still don\u2019t know about Sidewalk. For example, we don\u2019t know the details of the security and privacy measures. Likewise, we don\u2019t know what the mesh routing algorithms are. Thus, there\u2019s no independent analysis of Sidewalk.\n Moreover, while we like the sketch of Sidewalk\u2019s security, there will be inevitable transfers of information to Amazon, such as IDs of devices on the new network. We don\u2019t know if there are other information transfers to participating devices, or things\u00a0Amazon can infer.\n  Even though the initial description of privacy and security show that care went into designing Sidewalk, it\u2019s a version-one system. So there are bugs in the protocol and the software. There also will be bugs yet to be written in Sidewalk-compatible devices and software made by Amazon and its partners. Being an early-adopter of any new technology has the benefit of being early, as well as the risks of being early.\n  While Sidewalk has been designed for security and privacy, it has not been designed to mitigate abuse. This is a glaring hole.\n Amazon\u2019s whitepaper for Sidewalk describes a use case of a lost pet. The first Sidewalk partner is the Tile tracker. While we all empathize with someone whose pet is missing, and we\u2019ve all wondered where we left our keys, any system that allows one to track a pet allows one to be a stalker. So Sidewalk creates new opportunities for people to stalk family members, former romantic partners, friends, neighbors, co-workers, and others. Just drop a tracker in their handbag or car, and you can track them.   This has been our main criticism of Sidewalk, and to be fair, Tile says they are working on solutions .   This has also been our criticism of Apple\u2019s AirTags .\u00a0 Sidewalk amplifies the existing risk of a surreptitious tracker by giving it the extended reach of every Echo or Ring camera that\u2019s participating in the Sidewalk network. If Sidewalk systems don\u2019t have proper controls on them then estranged spouses, ex-roommates, and nosy neighbors, can use them to spy from anywhere in the world.\n We also are concerned about how Amazon might connect its new Sidewalk technology to one of its most controversial products:   Ring   home   doorbell   surveillance   cameras . For example, if Ring cameras are tied together through Sidewalk technology, they can form neighborhood-wide video surveillance systems.\n While Amazon\u2019s whitepapers indicate that the security and privacy is pretty good,\u00a0Amazon\u00a0is silent on these kinds of abuse scenarios. Indeed, their pet use case is a proxy for abuse. We are concerned that we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know about the overall ecosystem.\n  Perhaps the most important principle in respectful design is user consent. People must be free to autonomously choose whether or not to use a technology, and whether or not another entity may process their personal information. Opt-in systems have far lower participation than opt-out systems, because most people either are not aware of the system and its settings, or don\u2019t take the time to change the settings.\n Thus, defaults matter. By making Sidewalk opt-out instead of opt-in, Amazon is ginning up a wider reach of its network, at the cost of genuine user control of their own technologies.\n In Sidewalk\u2019s case, there might be a relatively low infosec cost to a person being pushed into the system until they opt-out. The major risk is the effect of bugs in the system. It\u2019s low risk, but not no risk.\n If Amazon had made its new system opt-in, we might not be writing about it at all. It would have traded slower growth for fewer complaints.\n  If you\u2019ve decided after reading this that you don\u2019t want to use Sidewalk, it\u2019s easy to turn off.\n Amazon has a page with instructions on how to turn Sidewalk off.  If you do not use Alexa, Echo, or Ring, you won\u2019t be using Sidewalk at all, so you don\u2019t have to worry about turning it off.\n  Amazon\u2019s Sidewalk system is a mesh network that uses their Echo devices and Ring cameras to improve the reach and reliability of their home automation systems and partner systems like Tile\u2019s tracker. It is not an internet sharing system as some have reported. Its design appears to be privacy-friendly and to have good security. It is a brand-new system, so there will be bugs in it.\n The major problem is a lack of mitigations to stop people from using it in abusive ways, such as tracking another person. It is also troubling that Amazon foisted the system on its users, placing on them the burden of opting out, rather than respecting its users\u2019 autonomy and giving the opportunity to opt-in.",

Antarctica, has primarily been able to generate enough revenue to support its business since its founding in 2014. With the fresh capital, Joyride will double down on its ability to help local operators find and finance  the right vehicles, access insurance programs from trusted partners and learn how to deploy a profitable fleet. Joyride has already offered these services to an extent alongside its SaaS business model, but wants to feature them more prominently as its business grows.\n \u201cReally early on in the pandemic, we saw companies like Bird and Lime pull out of almost every market they were in, and then almost right away we started to get a lot of local entrepreneurs from those cities contacting us and saying, \u2018Hey, Bird and Lime just left. I see a real opportunity here for me to run a micromobility business for myself,\u2019\u201d Joyride\u2019s founder and CEO Vince Cifani told TechCrunch.\n  Since last year, Joyride has seen interest from entrepreneurs looking to start small scooter and e-bike share businesses increase four-fold compared to pre-pandemic numbers, Cifani said. That looks like about 150 requests per week. Joyride\u2019s stats point to an emerging trend of local operators beginning to spring up in the parts of the world perhaps deemed too small fry for the big operators.\n Over the last couple of years, the industry seems to have been on the consolidation path, especially when we look at acquisitions like  Lime buying Jump and  Boosted and Bird buying  Circ and  Scoot. But we haven\u2019t really seen consolidation among the hundreds of smaller businesses operating locally, said Cifani. And while they may be small individually, they\u2019re mighty in numbers, quietly cropping up in towns and cities across the globe and privately at hotels and on campuses. In some cases, like with The Hague in the Netherlands, fleets are being operated by public transit.\n As local operators proliferate, the opportunity for companies like Joyride grows. In Germany, a similar software provider   Wunder Mobility  recently launched a lending division to help micromobility startups finance fleets.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve identified that there are over 10,000 different markets for these types of local operators to run this type of business,\u201d said Cifani. \u201cSo if it\u2019s taken Bird, say, half a billion dollars to get into 100 plus markets, are they actually going to raise $100 billion to try and get into every single market opportunity in the world? The inflection point for us is that there\u2019s a huge opportunity for this long tail market, and we\u2019ve seen Bird try to pivot into that space as well with its fleet manager model.\u201d\n Under Bird\u2019s fleet manager model, which made up  94% of the company\u2019s \u201csharing\u201d revenue in the second half of 2020, the vehicles and software are supplied to local operators. Bird always maintains ownership and branding of the scooters. The fleet managers are responsible for fleet deployment and rebalancing, sanitization, and general care and maintenance of the Bird vehicles. In exchange, the operators receive a portion of the fee that users pay to rent the scooters.\n Joyride is different. The company helps customers buy fleets outright from manufacturing partners and in some cases helps them finance their vehicles.\n Where the big players like Bird and Lime have chased scale in the push to become profitable, Cifani says many of Joyride\u2019s operators running smaller operations tell him they\u2019ve paid back the money for all their vehicles within a few months.\n Joyride\u2019s seed round was led by Proeza Ventures, Urban Innovation Fund and Craig Miller, former CPO of Shopify, a platform that has similarly helped democratize the e-commerce space. Cifani says Joyride will be doing a Series A in the near future.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 11:38:41", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "software,\u8fd0\u8425\u5546", "title": "Micrococility Software\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546Joyride\u7b79\u96c6\u4e86370\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u79cd\u5b50 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tMicromobility software provider Joyride raises $3.7 million seed round\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/micromobility-software-provider-joyride-raises-3-7-million-seed-round/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["software", "\u8fd0\u8425\u5546"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "314c4f2178fa7e14f3fd76e54b9d9774.jpg", "infoid": 1067629, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6765\u81eaMax Planck\u5206\u5b50\u690d\u7269\u751f\u7406\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u5458\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u56e2\u961f\uff0c\u5373\u5a01\u5c14\u5bcc\u901a\u79d1\u5b66\u5927\u5b66\uff0cWeizmann\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u548c\u73af\u5883\u548c\u5730\u7403\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u642c\u8fd0\u5de5\u5b66\u9662\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4ece\u7a7a\u4e2d\u5236\u4f5c\u98df\u7269\u6bd4\u751f\u957f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5e84\u7a3c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5728\u56fd\u5bb6\u79d1\u5b66\u9662\u7684\u8bc9\u8bbc\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\uff0c\u672c\u96c6\u56e2\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u79cd\u690d\u4f5c\u7269\uff08\u5927\u8c46\uff09\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u98df\u54c1 - \u7a7a\u6c14\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u51e0\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5730\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u957f\uff06\uff0334\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5;\u6765\u81ea\u7a7a\u6c14\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u5c06\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u71c3\u6599\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u7a7a\u6c14\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u71c3\u6599\u8d44\u6e90\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u4ea7\u751f\u98df\u7528\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7684\u7ec6\u83cc\u4ea7\u751f\u98df\u7269\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u662f\u82ac\u5170\u7684\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u98df\u54c1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u57282023\u5e74\u4e4b\u524d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u793a\u8303\u5de5\u5382\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u9879\u65b0\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u8bd5\u56fe\u6bd4\u8f83\u4ece\u7a7a\u6c14\u4e2d\u751f\u957f\u98df\u7269\u7684\u4e3b\u98df\u4f5c\u7269\u5927\u8c46\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002\n  \u4e3a\u4e86\u4f7f\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u98df\u54c1 - \u7a7a\u6c14\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u9762\u677f\u6765\u5236\u4f5c\u7535\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u7a7a\u6c14\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u79cd\u690d\u7684\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u751f\u4ea7\u98df\u7269\u3002\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5e72\u71e5\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5e72\u71e5\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u9002\u5408\u4e8e\u4eba\u548c\u52a8\u7269\u6d88\u8d39\u7684\u7c89\u672b\u3002\n  \u5b83\u4eec\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e10\u5e73\u65b9\u5343\u7c73\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5728\u5730\u9762\u4e0a\u751f\u957f\u5927\u8c46\uff0c\u7a7a\u6c14\u4e2d\u7684\u98df\u7269\u589e\u957f10\u500d\u3002\u6362\u53e5\u8bdd\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5efa\u8bae\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u768410\u5e73\u65b9\u516c\u91cc\u7684\u571f\u5730\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u79cd\u690d\u5927\u8c46\u7684\u571f\u5730\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u65b9\u516c\u91cc\u7684\u4e00\u5757\u571f\u5730\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u7a7a\u4e2d\u79cd\u690d\u98df\u7269\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e5d\u5e73\u65b9\u516c\u91cc\u8f6c\u52a8\u56de\u5230\u91ce\u751f\u68ee\u6797\u7684\u589e\u957f\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u4f7f\u7528\u98df\u7269 - \u7a7a\u6c14\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5177\u6709\u4e24\u500d\u7684\u70ed\u91cf\u503c\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5176\u4ed6\u4f5c\u7269\uff0c\u5982\u7389\u7c73\uff0c\u5c0f\u9ea6\u548c\u6c34\u7a3b\u3002\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\uff1aDorian Leger\u7b49\uff0c\u5149\u4f0f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u751f\u4ea7\u53ef\u4ee5\u6bd4\u5e38\u89c4\u4f5c\u7269\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u571f\u5730\u548c\u9633\u5149\uff0c\u5168\u56fd\u79d1\u5b66\u9662\u7684\u5e38\u89c4\u4f5c\u54c1\uff082021\u5e74\uff09\u3002 DOI\uff1a10.1073 / PNAS.2015025118 ", "note_en": "A team of researchers from the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology, the University of Naples Federico II, the Weizmann Institute of Science and the Porter School of the Environment and Earth Sciences has found that making food from air would be far more efficient than growing crops. In their paper published in  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the group describes their analysis and comparison of the efficiency of growing crops (soybeans) and using a food-from-air technique.    For several years, researchers around the world have been looking into the idea of growing &#34;  from air,&#34; combining a renewable fuel resource with carbon from the air to create food for a type of bacteria that create edible protein. One such project is Solar Foods in Finland, where researchers have the goal of building a demonstration plant by 2023. In this new effort, the researchers sought to compare the efficiency of growing a staple crop, soybeans, with growing food from air.\n  To make their comparisons, the researchers used a food-from-air system that uses solar energy panels to make electricity, which is combined with   from the air to produce food for microbes grown in a bioreactor. The protein the microbes produce is then treated to remove   and then dried to produce a powder suitable for consumption by humans and animals.\n  They compared the efficiency of the system with a 10-square-kilometer   field. Their analysis showed that growing food from air was 10 times as efficient as growing soybeans in the ground. Put another way, they suggested that a 10-square-kilometer piece of land in the Amazon used to grow soybeans could be converted to a one-square-kilometer piece of land for growing food from the air, with the other nine square kilometers turned back to wild forest growth.

", "note_en": "Weirdly hard to define, much less to feel OK about it, pleasure is a tricky creature. Can philosophy help us lighten up?\n Over breakfast one April day in 1778, James Boswell asked Samuel Johnson why he gave up booze. Dr Johnson replied that he didn\u2019t like to lose power over himself, but assured his friend that he would one day drink again when he grew old (he was 68 at the time). Boswell replied: \u2018I think, Sir, you once said to me, that not to drink wine was a great deduction from life.\u2019 To which Dr Johnson answered: \u2018It is a diminution of pleasure, to be sure; but I do not say a diminution of happiness. There is more happiness in being rational.\u2019\n It is a common notion, even in our own day, that pleasure is in some sense a distraction from happiness \u2013 or that it doesn\u2019t lead to the kind of happiness that  really matters. Pleasure, in and of itself, is \u2018lower\u2019 than the real heavy hitters, such as Truth and Virtue and Wisdom and God, those hallowed founts of  authentic happiness. It is universal \u2013 indeed inherent \u2013 that we humans are drawn to pleasure. Yet pleasure-seeking itself is often seen as an indulgence, and therefore rings with a kind of selfishness, even a kind of confusion. Pleasure doesn\u2019t last, the idea goes, but Truth does, or Rationality does, or Wisdom does, and so those are the things that we ought to seek.\n Whenever and wherever they are found, moralists and their dreary ilk often describe their own times as characterised by debauched hedonism. But does it accurately describe our time? Are we in the thrall of a love affair with pleasure? I don\u2019t think so. Even if more people are more comfortable than they used to be, it\u2019s still hard to admit to doing something pleasurable  just because it\u2019s pleasurable. More often, pleasure is excused as a little reward, a diversion, a break from the demands of the \u2018real world\u2019. Pleasure is something that will allow you to work harder, to catch your breath before returning to the turmoils of life. Searching for pleasure for pleasure\u2019s sake is an act tinged with shame and, when it\u2019s admitted to, excuses ought be made.\n Lord Byron gave our tense relationship with pleasure a memorable couplet: \u2018O pleasure! you\u2019re indeed a pleasant  thing / Although one must be damn\u2019d for you, no doubt.\u2019 Those who give in to pleasure have often been compared, unkindly, to animals. The Roman Stoic Epictetus told those who identified pleasure with goodness to go \u2018lead the life of a worm, of which you judged yourself worthy: eat and drink, and enjoy women, and ease yourself, and snore.\u2019 Friedrich Nietzsche located a being that, for him, was perhaps even lower than the worm: \u2018Man does not strive for pleasure,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018Only the Englishman does.\u2019\n This isn\u2019t true of all pleasures, however. The trouble for Dr Johnson, as he was quick to explain, was \u2018sensual pleasure. When a man says, he had pleasure with a woman, he does not mean conversation, but something of a very different nature.\u2019 (You can almost see the wink on his vast face.) The pleasures he disdains are the bodily pleasures, the ones we get from aged whisky and taking off your boots after a long hike. The pleasures that count, for Dr Johnson and for many other thinkers, are the pleasures of the mind. These are the pleasures that are pure, unmarred by the Earth. They\u2019re to be kept clean and separate from the pleasures of the body, which are for the lower sorts of people. Or, as Dr Johnson rather flatly put it: \u2018[T]he greatest part of men are gross.\u2019\n The purpose of this Guide is simple: I want to talk about some of the ways that people have thought about pleasure over the years. Pleasure is a surprisingly slippery idea, surprising because it seems so obvious what it is. But trying to actually nail it down is like nailing down a cloud. Regardless, that makes it more important to reflect on pleasure \u2013 its value, its nature, and the places that people have found it. My hope is that, by thinking through what pleasure is, by analysing and probing and querying it, perhaps you\u2019ll be more likely to find it in the places you least expect (but no promises, of course).\n Pleasure is everywhere and yet it\u2019s hard to work out quite what   it is\n The sheer variety of ways that people procure pleasure is unsettling, as well as a testament to the plasticity of our species. The differences can be small \u2013 I can\u2019t understand why people like to watch golf \u2013 and the differences can be great, especially across cultural and temporal gulfs \u2013 the pleasure people once got in attending the afternoon execution seems, to me, a  bit odd.\n Think of pleasure in your own life. What is common to all of the things that give you pleasure? The throughline between warm scarves and charity work and calling your grandmother; between the cool side of the pillow, the sad-happiness of nostalgia, the pop of a champagne bottle opening \u2013 what could it be other than that these are all, in their way, pleasing? So, the question is: if pleasure can be found in all these sundry ways, then what  is it? And the most common answer is a tad ho-hum: stuff that feels good. Stuff that you like. The experiences that make you say: \u2018Yep!  There  it is.\u2019\n Many philosophers have accepted this, or a version of it, and have taken it to mean that there\u2019s not a whole lot more to be said about the nature of pleasure (moralising about how others go about  getting pleasure, of course, is a different story). Pleasure is what it is. Its very heterogeneity, its inconceivable variety, has led many to conclude that it\u2019s an elementary component of our existence, or an absolutely simple experience. Edmund Burke said it was so simple it was \u2018incapable of definition\u2019. John Locke held that pleasure \u2018cannot be described \u2026 the way of knowing [pleasure] is \u2026 only by experience.\u2019\n This view of pleasure as unanalysable, it seems to me, makes the nature of pleasure even stranger given its ubiquity in our lives. Can it really just be, as William James held, that \u2018pleasures are generally associated with beneficial \u2026 experiences\u2019? Does  that definition truly exhaust pleasure? Maybe. When a significant number of philosophers, usually a loquacious bunch, throw up their hands and say that pleasure is too simple to describe, you know that the idea is an odd one. As Elizabeth Anscombe once wrote, the idea of pleasure even \u2018reduced Aristotle to sheer babble\u2019, and she was right, as far as I  can tell.\n Perhaps the problem, as so often, lies with language. Pleasure occupies a prime position in a very crowded constellation. Nearby, you\u2019ll find joy, delight, happiness, satisfaction and, perhaps a bit further on, ecstasy, euphoria, exaltation, bliss. Pleasure might just be stretched too thin, operating as a kind of catch-all for all the fine gradations of positive experience. (Plato thought so.) But, if asked  what it is that makes an experience positive, I would be hard pressed not to fall back and say, well, it\u2019s the experiences that give me pleasure.\n The pleasures of the mind are good; the pleasures of the body, not so much\n Nowadays, many philosophers enjoy delicate concept carving, in which definitions are given so precisely that no counterexamples could be found. Ideas are divided and subdivided, and  isms blossom and war with one another. But, traditionally, pleasure was rather bluntly cleaved into the two kinds of pleasures that I mentioned earlier: bodily pleasures and the pleasures of the mind. The division of pleasure mirrored the division of a person: the body was separate from the mind or the intellect or the soul, or whatever you would like to call that thing that makes you  you (but isn\u2019t your body). Bodily pleasures include easing into a warm bath, Arizona Iced Tea, and vigorous  masturbation; while among the pleasures of the mind are imagining retribution on your enemies (and maybe your friends), feeling at one with nature, contemplating the higher truths and, naturally for philosophers, philosophy \u2013 which has often been called the highest pleasure.\n Why is it that the bodily pleasures have accrued such a poor reputation? Plato, as usual, had the first, very loud, say on the matter. His views shift over the course of the dialogues, but some general themes stand out. Bodily pleasure, he says, is often connected to pain and, because pain is a bad thing, so too is bodily pleasure.\n The relationship between pleasure and pain is intimate and tempestuous indeed. Plato said that sometimes you feel pleasure precisely when you\u2019re relieved of a pain. Before Socrates was executed, he noticed that the bonds that he was kept in hurt him, but once released \u2018pleasure seem[ed] to be following\u2019. Bodily pleasures can also straightforwardly lead to pain, in the case of repetition or overindulgence. If I have one brownie, I\u2019m feeling pretty good about things, but if I have 50, I\u2019m in a dark place, re-examining my life decisions. Finally, pleasure also usually comes from fulfilling some desire. But Plato considered desires themselves painful, because they identify what in our lives is lacking. As Emily Fletcher put it in her excellent  analysis: \u2018[W]e always experience pleasure against a backdrop of pain.\u2019\n Bodily pleasures also receive the brunt of the blame for leading people astray, and this is Plato\u2019s other criticism (which would be taken up with gusto by later Christian moralists seeking to shape the actions of others). This is the idea that bodily pleasure, and the seeking of bodily pleasure, produces false beliefs because, through bodily pleasure, the body comes to seem more important than the soul (the false belief par excellence for Plato). In another foreshadowing of the Christian view, Plato wrote in the  Phaedo that your body is the \u2018prison\u2019 of your soul. There\u2019s a fast and essential distinction between the two, and a struggle between them as well. Whenever you indulge yourself in the pleasures of the flesh, you become \u2018an accomplice in [your] own imprisonment\u2019 because it gives you the misguided impression that this fleshy, soul-entombing jail is somehow a good thing. \u2018[E]very pleasure and pain provides,\u2019 Plato went on, \u2018another nail to rivet the soul to the body and to weld them together. It makes the soul corporeal, so that it necessarily believes the truth is what the body says it is.\u2019 The soul is the way to truth, and therefore the body and its pleasures are distractions leading to falsity and confusion.\n The pleasures of the mind, however, are free of most, if not all, of the blemishes that make bodily pleasures unworthy of philosophers. The pleasures of the mind are \u2018pure\u2019. They\u2019re usually unconnected in any intrinsic way to pain, and they have to do with the soul, which bears upon your inevitable journey into the afterlife. Plato thought that the greatest pleasure of the mind is the pleasure of learning \u2013 particularly of the virtues. By avoiding the pleasures of the flesh and instead learning of the virtue and wisdom, your soul will attain \u2018its own ornaments, namely, moderation, righteousness, courage, freedom and truth, and in that state [await your] journey to the underworld.\u2019\n But what exactly is  pleasurable about the pleasures of the mind? Thinkers have long made the connection between the pleasures of the mind and the great things unseen, usually God. More interesting, of course, is how they\u2019re described in a secular context. William James called intellectual pleasures \u2018the subtler emotions\u2019: \u2018Concords of sounds, of colours, of lines, logical consistencies, teleological fitnesses,\u2019 he wrote, \u2018affect us with a pleasure that seems ingrained in the very form of the representation itself.\u2019 These are \u2018cognitive acts\u2019, but ultimately not so different from the bodily pleasures, and he notes that when we\u2019re enthralled by a great pleasure of the mind, it tends to lead to pleasures of the body. We should be wary, as with most distinctions, of drawing the line too thick.\n  Next to the Christians, the Stoics were \u2013 and perhaps  are, given the recent  resurgence of interest \u2013 the great denigrators of bodily pleasure. Not all of them, but it\u2019s a suspicion that commonly invades their lofty view of the Universe. Virtue, for the Stoics, was all-important, the  summum bonum of life \u2013 at least if you\u2019re wise \u2013 and anything that got in the way of the pursuit of virtue was treated warily at best.  Path\u0113 (passions) were to be avoided, and pleasure was a significant contributor because it confuses clear thinking and creates untoward desires. The pleasures of the flesh were haughtily detested, a view that the Christians took up with verve.\n Their rivals in the ancient world were the Epicureans. Pleasure was the centre of Epicurus\u2019  thought. This wasn\u2019t pleasure in a positive sense, not a seasoning on the meat of life itself. It\u2019s pleasure as an  absence.\n  The pleasure that we pursue is not that kind alone which directly affects our being with delight and is perceived by the senses in an agreeable way. Rather we hold that the greatest pleasure is one that\u2019s experienced as a result of the complete removal of pain.\n Or, as Adam Smith later put it: \u2018What can be added to the happiness of the man who is in health, who is out of debt, and has a clear conscience?\u2019\n This view applies both to bodily pleasures and to pleasures of the mind. Epicurus thought that the pleasures of the flesh consisted, for instance, in  not being thirsty. What is the analogue to pleasures of the mind? He determined that the primary weight on our souls was the fear of death, which he sought to disabuse us of with an elegant little formula: when you are alive, death is nothing, and when you are dead, life is nothing. Once this is truly understood, then the weighty, wearying fear of death will be alleviated \u2013 and its  absence is a great pleasure.\n Though it is a moderate and negative view of bodily pleasure, it amounts to a fairly robust defence. It is an approach to life that tends to cultivate the materiality of our lives, to allow us to take joy in the physical humanness of being human. A line can be drawn from Epicurus to Valla to Erasmus to Montaigne to Voltaire to Hume to Mill to Russell: a life-affirming, world-accepting tradition that urges us not to fear the pleasures of the flesh (in moderation, of course). As Montaigne wrote: \u2018I, who operate only close to the ground, hate that inhuman wisdom that would make us disdainful enemies of the cultivation of the body.\u2019\n  On another April day, this one in 1336, Petrarch decided to go for a hike up Mont Ventoux, in Provence. It\u2019s not an easy task \u2013 an  18-hour round trip, more or less, up to a bald and very windy peak (hence the mountain\u2019s name). This ascent has since taken on the aspect of myth, a moment that seemed to herald the arrival of humanism, because it was supposedly the first time that someone had climbed a mountain simply for the pleasure of doing so. \u2018My only motive,\u2019 Petrarch wrote, \u2018was the wish to see what so great an elevation had to offer.\u2019\n His account is filled with allegory and heavy-handed allusions to  St Augustine\u2019s own conversion experience a millennium earlier. But it\u2019s still the moving testament of a man on a mountain,  taken in by the beauty of a singular landscape. He looks south towards Italy and is affected by memories of the ancient Romans. He looks west towards the Pyrenees and north towards Lyon and, even though he can\u2019t actually see these places, he knows that they are there and that he\u2019s standing tall above them, all of Europe at his feet. Naturally, he \u2018stood like one dazed\u2019.\n The pleasure Petrarch found in nature was in its immensity. He was lost in its vastness, overwhelmed by nature and his little place in it, hardly more than a speck of pollen in the wind. But he was also towering above the continent: \u2018I beheld the clouds under our feet,\u2019 he said. He is, at once, insignificant and all-powerful: an unsettling tension where you can sometimes find the subtle pleasures of the sublime. William Wordsworth was one of the first to illuminate this peculiar sensation, which he did most famously in his poem \u2018Tintern  Abbey\u2019 (1798):\n \u2013 And I have felt A presence that disturbs me with the joy Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused, Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, And the round ocean and the living air, And the blue sky, and in the mind of man: A motion and a spirit, that impels All thinking things, all objects of all thought, And rolls through all things.\n But you can also find in nature a very different kind of pleasure, almost entirely at variance with the  sublime. That is the pleasures of isolation, of  solitude, of being freed, for a spell, from the drudgeries of \u2018society\u2019 and its countless goddamned \u2018people\u2019. Alone in nature, you can play as a hermit for a bit, which I think can allow you to recover a sense of your own uniqueness. As Byron wrote: \u2018There is a pleasure in the pathless  woods, / There is a rapture on the lonely shore.\u2019 Though he went on to acclaim his love of all nature, it is the  pathlessness of the woods that caught his interest: the pleasurable fact that, out here, no one\u2019s tread before. In that way, perhaps, nature can help remind you of the indelible pleasure of being yourself.\n  Schadenfreude is a bottomless reservoir, of course. Whether you drink from it with embarrassment or pride, it is still wonderfully pleasing to see your enemies fail \u2013 and most people have enough enemies, who do enough inexcusable stuff, that this particular spring of pleasure will never run dry. But what about its rather less provocative opposite: taking pleasure in the pleasure of others?\n It\u2019s been observed that when a child gives a gift to another kid, they themselves become happier. And the Buddhist idea of  mudit\u0101 captures the phenomenon: it is the joy we feel when others are well. We are an essentially social species, and many philosophers have  held that human nature cannot be fully realised without other people: being  with one another is an indispensable part of being a human in the first place. If that\u2019s the case, it makes a lot of sense that we would \u2018naturally\u2019 find the happiness of others pleasing to us. Of course \u2013  of course \u2013 a huge amount rides on whom we\u2019re talking about here. Yes, it\u2019s obviously pleasurable to gift a friend a top-notch loofah. But if you\u2019re genuinely pleased by, say, seeing Kim Jong-un\u2019s boyish excitement at attending a basketball game, then we need to have a serious talk about the world.\n Setting aside dictators and  jerks, why is it pleasing to make others pleased? Philosophers, particularly in the  18th century, had a winningly simple answer: because it is good. Or, more precisely, because  that is what goodness itself is \u2013 the increasing of pleasure in the world.\n Moral exhortations the world over have often boiled down to something like a common denominator: be not a nuisance to those you happen to be passing this life with, and, if you can, be a positive force for letting people get on with it. For instance, take these lines from a  4,000-year-old Babylonian advice book, amusing in their familiarity:\n Be pleasant to your enemy. Do not utter slander; speak well of people; Do not say nasty things; speak favourably.\n The question is  why people should act well. The answer has long been found in the divine and the otherworldly: because God\u2019s judging you and he\u2019s got a very sharp memory; because if you\u2019re a wretch there are some hellish surprises in store for you; because my interpretation of the Bible says so. What is radical about the philosophers who identified pleasure with goodness, then, is that they brought morality into the real world, there for it to be seen and tested, even quantified.\n Anthony Ashley Cooper, the third earl of Shaftesbury, was among the first to link the idea of the goodness of pleasure with the essentially social nature of humans. In  Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times (1711), he made \u2018public good\u2019 in and of itself a virtue, necessary for all those who woul\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-23 11:30:41", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8003\u8651,pleasure,\u4e16\u754c", "title": "\u5982\u4f55\u8003\u8651\u5feb\u4e50 ", "title_en": "How to Think about Pleasure", "transed": 1, "url": "https://psyche.co/guides/from-hedonism-to-humanism-philosophys-defence-of-pleasure", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8003\u8651", "pleasure", "\u4e16\u754c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067627, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u9605\u8bfb\u4e66\u7c4d\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u53cb\u597d\u7248\u672c\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728GitHub\u4e0a\u627e\u5230\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\n \u4f5c\u4e3a\u5019\u9009\u4eba\uff0c\u6211\u5728\u5341\u51e0\u5bb6\u5927\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u91c7\u8bbf\u8fc7\u3002\u6211\u4e3a\u516c\u53f8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u4f18\u60e0\uff0c\u5305\u62ecGoogle\uff0cNvidia\uff0cSnap\uff0cNetflix\uff0cPrimer AI\u548cSnorkel AI\u3002\u6211\u4e5f\u88ab\u8bb8\u591a\u5176\u4ed6\u516c\u53f8\u62d2\u7edd\u4e86\u3002\n \u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u540d\u9762\u8bd5\u5b98\uff0c\u6211\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e86\u5728Nvidia\u548cSnorkel Ai\u7684\u62db\u8058\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u51b7\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u90a3\u91cc\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u6211\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u505a\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u548c\u6280\u672f\u9762\u8bd5\uff0c\u8fa9\u8bba\u662f\u5426\u96c7\u7528\u5019\u9009\u4eba\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u8bf4\u670d\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u9009\u62e9\u6211\u4eec\u8d85\u8fc7\u7ade\u4e89\u4f18\u60e0\u3002\n \u4f5c\u4e3a\u670b\u53cb\u548c\u8001\u5e08\uff0c\u6211\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u670b\u53cb\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u5927\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbf\u8c08\u65b9\u9762\u505a\u597d\u51c6\u5907\u3002\u6211\u7ed9\u4ed6\u4eec\u5632\u7b11\u9762\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bb0\u5f55\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ed6\u4eec\u88ab\u95ee\u5230\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n \u6211\u8fd8\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u62db\u8058\u7ba1\u9053\u4e0a\u54a8\u8be2\u4e86\u51e0\u9879\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u3002\u96c7\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u89d2\u8272\u5728\u60a8\u5c1a\u672a\u62e5\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u56e2\u961f\u548c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u60a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u5207\u90fd\u5f88\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u4ecd\u7136\u5f88\u65b0\uff0c\u5f88\u591a\u516c\u53f8\u4ecd\u7136\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fdb\u5165\u65f6\u5f25\u8865\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8ba9\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u3002\n \u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u662f\u5750\u5728\u684c\u5b50\u4e24\u4fa7\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u4eba\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u667a\u6167\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8c01\u82b1\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u8003\u8651\u62db\u8058\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u5b83\u662f\u7528\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u5199\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u62db\u8058\u4e86\u90a3\u4e9b\u770b\u5230\u65e9\u671f\u8349\u6848\u7684\u7ecf\u7406\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u4ed6\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4ed6\u516c\u53f8\u5982\u4f55\u62db\u8058\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\n \u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u7531\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u7ec4\u6210\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u8bd5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6982\u8ff0\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u54ea\u4e9b\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89d2\u8272\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u8be2\u95ee\u54ea\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u505a\u597d\u51c6\u5907\u3002\u8fd9\u90e8\u5206\u4e5f\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u91c7\u8bbf\u8005\u7684\u5fc3\u6001\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bfb\u627e\u4ec0\u4e48\u6837\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002 \n\u7b2c\u4e8c\u90e8\u5206\u7531200\u591a\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u9898\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u4ee5\u5176\u96be\u5ea6\u6c34\u5e73 -

You can find the source code on  GitHub.\n As a candidate, I\u2019ve interviewed at a dozen big companies and startups. I\u2019ve got offers for machine learning roles at companies including Google, NVIDIA, Snap, Netflix, Primer AI, and Snorkel AI. I\u2019ve also been rejected at many other companies.\n As an interviewer, I\u2019ve been involved in designing and executing the hiring process at NVIDIA and Snorkel AI, having taken steps from cold emailing candidates whose work I love, screening resumes, doing exploratory and technical interviews, debating whether or not to hire a candidate, to trying to convince candidates to choose us over competitive offers.\n As a friend and teacher, I\u2019ve helped many friends and students prepare for their machine learning interviews at big companies and startups. I give them mock interviews and take notes of the process they went through as well as the questions they were asked.\n I\u2019ve also consulted several startups on their machine learning hiring pipelines. Hiring for machine learning roles turned out to be pretty difficult when you don\u2019t already have a strong in-house machine learning team and process to help you evaluate candidates. As the use of machine learning in the industry is still pretty new, a lot of companies are still making it up as they go along, which doesn\u2019t make it easier for candidates.\n This book is the result of the collective wisdom of many people who have sat on both sides of the table and who have spent a lot of time thinking about the hiring process. It was written with candidates in mind, but hiring managers who saw the early drafts told me that they found it helpful to learn how other companies are hiring, and to rethink their own process.\n The book consists of two parts. The first part provides an overview of the machine learning interview process, what types of machine learning roles are available, what skills each role requires, what kinds of questions are often asked, and how to prepare for them. This part also explains the interviewers\u2019 mindset and what kind of signals they look for.\n The second part consists of over 200 knowledge questions, each noted with its level of difficulty -- interviews for more senior roles should expect harder questions -- that cover important concepts and common misconceptions in machine learning.\n After you&#39;ve finished this book, you might want to checkout  the 30 open-ended questions to test your ability to put together what you know to solve practical challenges. These questions test your problem-solving skills as well as the extent of your experiences in implementing and deploying machine learning models. Some companies call them  machine learning systems design questions. Almost all companies I\u2019ve talked to ask at least a question of this type in their interview process, and they are the questions that candidates often find to be the hardest.\n \u201cMachine learning systems design\u201d is an intricate topic that merits its own book. To learn more about it, check out my course   CS 329S: Machine learning systems design at Stanford.\n This book is not a replacement to machine learning textbooks nor a shortcut to game the interviews. It\u2019s a tool to consolidate your existing theoretical and practical knowledge in machine learning. The questions in this book can also help identify your blind/weak spots.

\u6210\u4e3a\u4f1a\u5458 ", "note_en": "TechSee, which describes itself as an \u201c intelligent visual assistance\u201d company, today announced the launch of Eve Cortex, a platform that teaches itself to recognize thousands of products, models, parts, and components by ingesting only a handful of data points. TechSee claims that by leveraging a combination of  AI and synthetic data, Cortex can train itself in a matter of hours, providing end users with step-by-step visual guidance via an  augmented reality (AR) overlay.\n The\u00a0AR market is estimated to grow from $10.7 billion in 2019 to $72.7 billion by 2024, according to a recent Markets and Markets\u00a0 report. At least a portion of that growth has been driven by field service applications; technicians are faced with the challenging task of working on equipment with varying technical specifications, often in confined or hard-to-reach spaces. With AR apps, they could have all of the information they need displayed in front of them while keeping their hands free to work.\n  TechSee was founded in 2014 by Eitan Cohen, Amir Yoffe, and Gabby Sarusi. Cohen conceptualized the idea after struggling to walk his parents through an issue they were having with their cable service. The company\u2019s cross-platform apps employ computer vision to recognize products and issues and streamline warranty registration. Customer agents can see what customers see through their smartphone cameras and visually guide them to resolutions, using either live video or photos.\n Cortex builds on TechSee\u2019s existing technologies to enable enterprises to custom-build their own visual self-service flows, without coding. With Cortex, companies can design journeys for product unboxing, billing, contracting, troubleshooting, warranty claims, product registration, technical repair, and more.\n \u201cThe future is here, and it\u2019s time to say goodbye to user manuals and embrace AR assistants,\u201d Cohen said in a press release. \u201cVirtual assistants that can see, hear, read, and interact are what\u2019s going to transform the way that consumers and employees receive assistance, while saving brands millions and generating new revenue.\u201d\n  Cortex can walk users through the unboxing of various consumer electronics, from security cameras to thermostats, and capture information for upselling while explaining invoices by reading water, gas, and electrical meters. Insurance policyholders can use Cortex to document damage to insured property or identify items they want to insure for virtual underwriting. Moreover, Cortex can certify that an on-site field technician has made a successful repair by examining work through the technician\u2019s smartphone or tablet camera or AR glasses.\n Behind the scenes, TechSee employs a combination of few-shot learning, transfer learning, and fine tuning for image segmentation and classification.  Few-shot learning refers to the practice of feeding an AI model with a very small amount of training data, while  transfer learning is a technique where a model trained on one task is repurposed on a second task.\n One of the ways that Cortex learns to recognize products is by ingesting a company\u2019s existing contact center knowledge base. For every device, each article describing visual symptoms and issues, both from customers and field technicians, is extracted and normalized. Then, a computer vision model is trained on synthetic visual data gathered in the lab as well as other visual resources and images supplied by customers, enabling Cortex to analyze, time, and measure the success of each step of every resolution, shortening and optimizing them over time.\n To use Cortex, a user taps on a link sent in a text message from a self-service channel and connects via a web browser. They\u2019re guided visually and with voice instructions on how to capture images. After they receive a confirmation message with a reference code, a customer service agent joins, views the images during a live video session, and provides step-by-step on-screen AR guidance.\n According to Cohen, companies including Vodafone, Telus, Orange, and Hippo have already tapped Cortex to create new customer experiences. Moreover, tens of thousands of field service technicians in the U.S. are using the platform to install fiber optic boxes.\n \u201cOne of the very few silver linings to come out of this pandemic is that it\u2019s accelerated adoption for our technology \u2014 in the field, at support centers, and for individual consumers,\u201d Cohen told VentureBeat in a previous interview. \u201cEverything is now contactless. When technicians simply aren\u2019t allowed to enter a customer\u2019s home to repair, say, a wireless router, or when a field technician cannot be dispatched to repair an HVAC system, both businesses and customers have to adapt.\u201d\n VentureBeat&#39;s mission is to be a digital town square for technical decision-makers to gain knowledge about transformative technology and transact.Our site delivers essential information on data technologies and strategies to guide you as you lead your organizations.

labour shortages are still worsening. In America the number of unfilled vacancies, at 9.3m, has never been so high. Job postings in Canada are 20% above pre-pandemic levels. Even in Europe, slower out of the post-lockdown gates, a growing number of employers complain of how hard it is to find staff. Debates over labour shortages have focused on welfare policy and economic disruption. But the phenomenon has a deeper lesson. It tells us something about the myths of automation.\n  Economists have confidently asserted that a wave of job-killing robots was sweeping the labour market. The   says the pandemic is \u201chastening a shift in employment away from sectors more vulnerable to automation\u201d. In a recent co-written article Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel prizewinner, says the extra costs of covid-19 are \u201caccelerating the development and adoption of new technologies to automate human work.\u201d In congressional testimony last year Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggested that more firms were \u201csubstituting machines for workers\u201d. But can pandemic-induced automation really be creating an army of surplus workers if employers are complaining of a deficit?\n  The economists had good reason to believe that job-killing automation would surge. Recessions often lead firms to adopt more robots, in part because labour gets more expensive as revenues but not wages decline. In a pandemic bosses have an extra incentive to automate jobs, as research by the   has shown. Robots do not need to socially distance. Nor do they get sick. Thanks largely to government stimulus programmes, firms have also accumulated spare cash, which they may now be able to deploy on robotics or on artificial-intelligence software.\n Those who believe that automation is speeding up can point to many examples. In Ohio Lee\u2019s Famous Recipe Chicken, a restaurant chain, has installed automated voice systems to take drive-through orders. Pittsburgh\u2019s international airport recently became America\u2019s first to use ultraviolet robots for cleaning. British farmers boast of using ever more machines to pick strawberries and kill weeds. The number of news stories mentioning both \u201cpandemic\u201d and \u201cautomation\u201d is growing at an annual rate of 25%.\n The automation debate is heavy on speculation and anecdote. It is light on evidence. The citation from one prominent wonk to justify the claim that automation was \u201calready\u201d happening included a  New York Times article and a theoretical microeconomics paper. According to some research, last year automatable jobs vanished in large numbers; but it is hard to disentangle the effect of technological change from lockdowns. It is true that America\u2019s   is nearly at its pre-pandemic level even as the level of employment is 7m lower. This, some say, shows that the economy can get by with many fewer people. But it could just mean that productivity per worker has risen, perhaps because of poorly understood things like remote working. Many of those on the sidelines will get jobs as fear of the virus fades and they find something which suits them, in turn raising output above pre-pandemic levels.\n  It is not only labour shortages which undermine the story of a growing wave of job-killing robots. In America the wages of the worst-paid workers, who are thought to be especially vulnerable to automation, are rising more quickly than the average, in contrast to the aftermath of the financial crisis. Borrowing a methodology from the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis,  The Economist has divided America\u2019s labour market into \u201croutine\u201d and \u201cnon-routine\u201d roles. Routine jobs involve patterns which are easier for robots to learn: say, data entry or checking out goods in a supermarket. For four decades routine jobs have slowly declined as a share of the total, as robots have improved (see chart).\n  So far, however, the covid-induced downturn is bucking the trend. Had the pre-pandemic rate continued, we estimate that in May 2021 routine jobs would have accounted for 40.9% of overall employment. In fact they now account for 41.4%, meaning that America now has in the order of 1m \u201cextra\u201d routine jobs than expected. Perhaps the uncertainty over variants is deferring some investment in robotics. The mere act of installing new machinery is also more difficult in a world of travel bans and quarantine. American imports of industrial robots fell by 3% in 2020.\n Australia may be a better place to look for signs of a job-killing wave. After some strict lockdowns the country has been under fairly loose domestic restrictions for over a year, giving a glimpse of what may lie in store elsewhere. Adapting the results of a government study in 2015, we gave 335 occupations (from \u201chotel and motel managers\u201d to \u201ccomplementary health therapists\u201d) a score from zero to 100, reflecting how automatable they seem.\n Automatable jobs were in relative decline before the pandemic, falling to 57% of the workforce by 2019. The trend has continued, with evidence of a covid-19 acceleration: 55% of Australians are now employed in vulnerable occupations. (We found similar trends in New Zealand.) Yet Australia\u2019s unemployment rate is nearly as low as before the pandemic. Howls from employers about labour shortages are even louder than in America. Automation is not, it seems, putting people on the economic scrapheap.\n The pessimists could eventually be proved right. But even if they are not, predictions of a world without work will continue. This is because the enduring fear of the march of the machines is not really the result of a dispassionate analysis of the evidence. It could hardly be so, when centuries of technological improvement have never led to widespread structural unemployment. Countries with more robots tend to have less joblessness, not more.\n  Worries about technological unemployment are instead the expression of something else. They reflect a deep-seated fascination with and fear of technology. And they reflect many economists\u2019 concern to get policymakers to pay more attention to the job prospects of people with the least marketable skills, who are always most vulnerable to economic shifts and shocks. These are perfectly understandable motivations. But next time you hear a warning about job-killing robots, think twice.  \u25a0\n  All our stories relating to the pandemic and the vaccines can be found on our  coronavirus hub.

The company says the training \u2014 including \u201csafe marksmanship\u201d and \u201ccountering an attack\u201d \u2014 was defensive in nature and devised to better protect Saudi leaders. One person familiar with the training said it also included work in surveillance and close-quarters battle.\n There is no evidence that the American officials who approved the training or Tier 1 Group executives knew that the Saudis were involved in the crackdown inside Saudi Arabia. But the fact that the government approved high-level military training for operatives who went on to carry out the grisly killing of a journalist shows how intensely intertwined the United States has become with an autocratic nation even as its agents committed horrific human rights abuses.\n It also underscores the perils of military partnerships with repressive governments and demonstrates how little oversight exists for those forces after they return home.\n Such issues are likely to continue as American private military contractors increasingly look to foreign clients to shore up their business as the United States scales back overseas deployments after two decades of war.\n The State Department initially granted a license for the paramilitary training of the Saudi Royal Guard to Tier 1 Group starting in 2014, during the Obama administration. The training continued during at least the first year of former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s term.\n Louis Bremer, a senior executive of Cerberus, Tier 1 Group\u2019s parent company, confirmed his company\u2019s role in the training last year in written answers to questions from lawmakers as part of his nomination for a top Pentagon job during the Trump administration.\n The administration does not appear to have sent the document to Congress before withdrawing Mr. Bremer\u2019s nomination; lawmakers never received answers to their questions.\n In the document, which Mr. Bremer provided to The New York Times, he said that four members of the Khashoggi kill team had received Tier 1 Group training in 2017, and two of them had participated in a previous iteration of the training, which went from October 2014 until January 2015.\n \u201cThe training provided was unrelated to their subsequent heinous acts,\u201d Mr. Bremer said in his responses.\n He said that a March 2019 review by Tier 1 Group \u201cuncovered no wrongdoing by the company and confirmed that the established curriculum training was unrelated to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.\u201d\n  Mr. Bremer said that the State Department, \u201cin collaboration with other U.S. departments and agencies,\u201d is responsible for vetting the foreign forces trained on U.S. soil. \u201cAll foreign personnel trained by T1G are cleared by the U.S. government for entry into the United States before commencement of training.\u201d\n In a statement, Mr. Bremer said that the training was \u201cprotective in nature\u201d and that the company conducted no further training of Saudis after December 2017.\n \u201cT1G management, the board and I stand firmly with the U.S. government, the American people and the international community in condemning the horrific murder of Jamal Khashoggi,\u201d he said.\n A 2019 column by David Ignatius of The Washington Post first reported that members of the Khashoggi kill team had received training in the United States. He wrote that the C.I.A. had \u201ccautioned other government agencies\u201d that some special-operations training may have been conducted by Tier 1 Group under a State Department license.\n The issue was central to Mr. Bremer\u2019s contentious confirmation hearing and the written questions from senators, asking him what role, if any, Tier 1 Group had in training Saudis who had participated in the Khashoggi operation.\n A State Department spokesman declined to confirm whether it awarded licenses to Tier 1 Group for the Saudi training.\n \u201cThis administration insists on responsible use of U.S. origin defense equipment and training by our allies and partners, and considers appropriate responses if violations occur,\u201d said the spokesman, Ned Price. \u201cSaudi Arabia faces significant threats to its territory, and we are committed to working together to help Riyadh strengthen its defenses.\u201d\n  Mr. Trump weighed  installing the head of Cerberus, Stephen A. Feinberg, in a top intelligence post last year, but the appointment was never made. While the Trump administration had appointed Mr. Feinberg to lead the President\u2019s Intelligence Advisory Board in 2018, questions emerged about potential conflicts of interest. Cerberus  formerly owned the military contractor DynCorp, which among other things provides intelligence advice to the United States and other clients.\n It is unclear which members of the Khashoggi kill team participated in the Tier 1 Group training. Seven members of the team belonged to an elite unit charged with protecting Prince Mohammed, according to an American  intelligence report about the assassination declassified in February.\n The role of operatives from the so-called Rapid Intervention Force in the Khashoggi killing helped bolster the American intelligence case that Prince Mohammed approved the operation.\n \u201cMembers of the R.I.F. would not have participated\u201d in the killing without his consent, according to the report. The group \u201cexists to defend the crown prince\u201d and \u201canswers only to him,\u201d the document said.\n Members of the team that killed Mr. Khashoggi were involved in at least a dozen operations starting in 2017, according to officials who have read classified intelligence reports about the campaign.\n Mr. Khashoggi, a columnist for The Post, was killed inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in October 2018, his body dismembered using a bone saw. The assassination brought widespread condemnation on Prince Mohammed, who has publicly denied any knowledge of the operation.\n  Eight defendants  were sentenced to up to two decades in prison last year, but human rights advocates criticized the punishments as aimed at lower-level agents while sparing their leaders.\n The C.I.A. concluded that the prince directed the operation, but Mr. Trump said that the evidence was inconclusive and that America\u2019s  diplomatic and economic relationship with the kingdom took priority. After President Biden took office and debated the issue with his advisers before the release of the declassified intelligence report, his administration announced sanctions on Saudis involved in the killing, including members of the elite unit who protect Prince Mohammed, but chose not to directly punish the crown prince.\n The earlier iteration of the training, which took place during the Obama administration, occurred before Prince Mohammed consolidated power in the kingdom. His predecessor as crown prince, Mohammed bin Nayef, was a close ally of the United States and in particular John O. Brennan, who served as C.I.A. director under President Barack Obama.\n Prince bin Nayef was the Saudi counterterrorism chief and collaborated closely with Obama administration officials in working to dismantle Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terrorist group\u2019s affiliate based in Yemen.\n In 2017, Prince bin Salman pushed Prince bin Nayef from power and executed a broader campaign to wrest power from his rivals \u2014 including a notorious episode of imprisoning Saudi royals and businessmen at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh.\n The Trump administration considered him a valuable partner in the Middle East \u2014 especially for the administration\u2019s strategy to isolate Iran \u2014 and Prince bin Salman developed a close relationship with Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law who served as a senior adviser to Mr. Trump.\n  Prince bin Salman, the son of King Salman, is the next in line to the Saudi throne. Prince bin Nayef remains under house arrest in the kingdom.\n The  Tier 1 Group website lists numerous American special operations and intelligence units as clients, along with \u201cspecialty units that do not require recognition.\u201d It said it also trains \u201cOGA special operator teams\u201d \u2014 one pseudonym for C.I.A. paramilitary units \u2014 as well as \u201cinternational allied forces.\u201d\n Under federal rules that restrict foreign sales of American arms and military expertise, Tier 1 Group was required to apply for licenses to train the foreign operatives. Those license applications were examined by State Department officials \u2014 who were processing tens of thousands of licenses per year \u2014 and approved.\n The approval would have allowed members of the Saudi Royal Guard to enter the United States on visas processed by the American Embassy in Riyadh. The path is similar to the one followed by Second Lt. Mohammed Alshamrani, a Royal Saudi Air Force officer who  opened fire in 2019 at a naval air station in Pensacola, Fla., where he was receiving military flight training. The attack killed three people and wounded eight.\n Tier 1 Group was founded to train U.S. military personnel, taking advantage of an expanded Pentagon budget for military personnel training in basic counterinsurgency skills, according to former American officials familiar with its operations.\n One of the company\u2019s founders, Steve Reichert, a former Marine, was working as an instructor for the security contractor then known as Blackwater when he met Mr. Feinberg. With Mr. Feinberg\u2019s backing, Mr. Reichert set up Tier 1 Group, according to Mr. Reichert\u2019s  2020 account of the company\u2019s founding and former intelligence officials familiar with the efforts.\n But as U.S. military training budgets began to shrink, the company, like other private security firms, began searching for new clients. By 2014, it was beginning to train foreign military units, including Saudis.\n Decisions about granting licenses to American firms to train foreign nationals are usually made after getting input from numerous government agencies, said R. Clarke Cooper, the assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs during the Trump administration. The Pentagon and intelligence agencies often play a role, he said.\n \u201cThese things don\u2019t just come out of the ether,\u201d he said.\n Mr. Cooper said he could not recall any discussion about the Tier 1 Group training of Saudis, even after Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing. He said there were intense deliberations inside the Trump administration about how to respond to the killing after the government concluded that Prince Mohammed most likely approved it.\n In the end, he said, administration officials did not want to squander America\u2019s relationship with the kingdom \u2014 and the strategy of isolating Iran \u2014 by taking a heavy-handed approach after Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n \u201cNo government is going to flush a significant bilateral relationship over this murder, no matter how horrific it was,\u201d he said.", "posttime": "2021-06-23

", "note_en": "Skip to main content                                                                                                                When Paul McBeth first started playing in professional disc golf tournaments, he\u2019d crisscross California in his father\u2019s 1978 Dodge Ramcharger. His dad had mostly used it to rock-crawl in the desert outskirts of Los Angeles. The top of the SUV was sawed off and the side windows were smashed out. The doors were so dented they looked like topographic maps. The windshield was scarred, and the gas pedal was missing. When storm clouds gathered, Paul kicked a metal bar to the floor as he tried to outrun the rain.\n His next few cars weren\u2019t much nicer. When he was 19, he found out a friend was planning to dump an Infiniti I30 in the scrapyard and offered to pay him $500 for it. McBeth drove it from L.A. to Kansas City for the  2009 Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA) world championships and  almost all the way back. It blew a gasket 30 minutes from his house. Then there was his Ford Thunderbird that overheated every half-hour on the highway, and his camper van that he thought would save him money on hotels but ended up costing him at the gas pump.\n Finally, in 2011, after winning $4,000 for taking first place at the Memorial Championship in Scottsdale, Arizona, McBeth had saved enough money to buy a new car. He wanted a Jeep Patriot. The problem was the paperwork. \u201cUnder occupation, I put \u2018professional athlete,\u2019\u201d McBeth says. \u201cI guess they didn\u2019t believe me because they wouldn\u2019t let me finance it. I ended up having to buy the car with cash.\u201d\n In the decade since, McBeth\u2019s disc golf career has soared. He\u2019s won the PDGA world championship five times and the United States Disc Golf championship twice. In 2010, the PDGA championship\u2019s total purse was  $33,782; at this week\u2019s event, the men\u2019s winnings are expected to be upward of  $150,000. McBeth has earned more than  half a million dollars from his performances. He is, undoubtedly, the most accomplished disc golfer in the world.\n But except to a subset of hardcore frisbee fans, his more impressive accomplishments have come away from the course. In February, disc golf manufacturer Discraft announced it had extended McBeth\u2019s endorsement deal to a  guaranteed  $10 million over 10 years. McBeth also has sponsors for other disc golf gear, such as grip equipment and bags, and owns part of a company called Foundation Disc Golf that produces both products and content. He has deals outside of disc golf equipment too, with the likes of Adidas and Celsius energy drink. According to 2019 data from the  athlete marketing platform Opendorse, only about 70 athletes in the world make at least a million dollars a year in endorsement deals. McBeth\u2019s endorsement income from Discraft alone puts him on par with Bears linebacker Khalil Mack, Jazz guard Mike Conley Jr., and Astros pitcher Justin Verlander.\n \u201cUnder occupation, I put \u2018professional athlete.\u2019 I guess they didn\u2019t believe me because they wouldn\u2019t let me finance it. I ended up having to buy the car with cash.\u201d \u2014Paul McBeth\n McBeth has carved out a lucrative career in a niche sport, in part as an athlete and in part as an influencer. He isn\u2019t alone in using this blueprint. Competitors in sports ranging from bowling to lacrosse have been able to amass riches by building their brands\u2014and growing the games they love along the way.\n \u201cI think about it as a three-step funnel,\u201d says Li Jin, the founder of the digital marketing platform Atelier Ventures who coined the term \u201cPassion Economy\u201d to describe how influencers monetize social media. The first step is to attract a big audience on a known platform, like Instagram or Twitter. The second is to bring them to a platform the influencer owns, such as a newsletter or podcast. The final step is to turn people into paying customers. \u201cThat,\u201d she says, \u201cis how influencers turn social capital into financial capital.\u201d\n McBeth agreed to that $10 million deal in July 2020 after hosting a paintball party for his 30th birthday. A couple of months later, he signed the paperwork at Discraft\u2019s headquarters in Michigan. In November, he shared a  series of stories with his 150,000-plus Instagram followers. The first showed a trailer from a car dealership in Michigan. The second and third showed glamorous shots of his latest car purchase: a McLaren 570S Spider. The luxury convertible\u2014which starts at more than $200,000\u2014has switchblade doors and a retractable roof.\n   By now you may have started browsing for disc golf gear in another tab. But before you complete your order, you first need to figure out how to get anyone\u2019s attention. Not long ago, niche sports cracked the national consciousness only as punch lines. In a now-iconic  Seinfeld episode, George Costanza gets a severance package from the Yankees\u2014enough to sustain him for an entire summer\u2014and tells Jerry he\u2019s going to learn to play frolf.\n    In the 2004 comedy  Dodgeball, Vince Vaughn\u2019s group of misfits face off against Ben Stiller\u2019s crew of hulking weightlifters on a fictional channel called ESPN 8: The Ocho. The parody network became such a cultural phenomenon that in 2017 ESPN launched an annual \u201c Ocho TV\u201d day, featuring events like the National Stone Skipping Competition and World Sign Spinning Championship. (How sign spinning became an international competition before stone skipping is a mystery best explored in a separate story.) But those so-called joke sports have had the last laugh. From 2017 to 2019, ESPN\u2019s the Ocho ratings  climbed year over year. Last May, a deadlift world record attempt drew more than  300,000 viewers\u2014the network\u2019s most-watched program of the day.\n For many niche sports, television is still seen as the ultimate status symbol. Some leagues have gone so far as to buy air time for their biggest events. Last year, Dynamic Discs paid the CBS Sports Network \u201c in excess of six figures\u201d to broadcast their disc golf tournament. This stands in contrast to networks\u2019 relationships with the more prominent sports leagues. In March, the NFL  secured $113 billion from its television partners for the rights to air football games over the next 11 years.\n But television isn\u2019t the only way to command mass attention. For smaller sports and their stars, social media provides access to massive audiences without traditional gatekeepers. \u201cTo millions of kids, TikTok and YouTube are mainstream entertainment. They don\u2019t watch TV,\u201d says Taylor Lorenz, who covers social media, Gen Z, and influencers for  The New York Times. \u201cSometimes you need to get onto TV to get credibility with boomer CEOs. But for individuals, you can often monetize better on your social media.\u201d\n  The surest path to profitability is to go viral. And the kings of the viral clip are the dudes from Dude Perfect. What began as a series of stunts by college roommates at Texas A&amp;M has turned into the most popular sports channel on YouTube. Dude Perfect has nearly twice as many subscribers (56 million) as four major U.S. sports leagues\u2014the NBA (16.7 million), NFL (7.8 million), MLB (3.0 million), and NHL (1.6 million)\u2014combined. Its  water bottle flips and  ping-pong tricks have reshaped what constitutes athletic accomplishment online. And its influence echoes across the niche sports landscape. (The dudes declined to be interviewed for this story.)\n McBeth is friends and business partners with Brodie Smith, a former ultimate player who became internet famous for his frisbee trick shots and has collaborated on three videos with Dude Perfect. Smith, who boasts more than 2 million YouTube subscribers and almost a million Instagram and Twitter followers, instantly became the world\u2019s most famous disc golf player when he turned pro in late 2019. Smith has documented his journey into the sport, and has learned the finer points of the game from McBeth. In exchange, Smith has schooled McBeth on the finer points of internet fame. \u201cBrodie has made everyone in disc golf up their YouTube game,\u201d McBeth says. \u201cHe\u2019s inspired me a lot. We used to try to find the time to post videos when we could. Now we make the time. It\u2019s become a priority.\u201d\n  Jason Belmonte, the most accomplished professional bowler in the world, has collaborated on two videos with Dude Perfect. The first\u2014which shows him whizzing bowling balls past the dudes\u2019 heads and breaking flying plates with bowling pins\u2014has accumulated almost 100 million views. According to  Aux Mode, a digital service that projects the value of YouTube videos, 100 million views translates to about $400,000 of revenue. The popularity of a channel and its engagement rate can increase the value of those videos even further.\n  \u201cSome people in my fan base can recite every single stunt I performed in those videos but don\u2019t know how many titles I\u2019ve won,\u201d says Belmonte, who\u2019s captured 25 Professional Bowlers Association titles, including a record 13 major championships. \u201cEntertainment is king right now. Whether you\u2019re bowling around a dude\u2019s head or doing the world\u2019s longest strike, entertainment is what sticks in people\u2019s minds.\u201d\n Until television rights deals increase enough to start funding substantial salaries in niche sports, social media is the best way for these athletes to earn a living. Life-changing money  is out there, but they do have to earn it.\n  When Jennifer Delaney was a little girl, her father fastened a string to two ends of a stick to create a makeshift bow and instill in her a love of archery. As an MBA candidate at SMU, she rediscovered this passion as a way to relieve her stress from school and networking events. Her mother thought she should have taken up a \u201cnormal\u201d sport, like golf. In the beginning, Delaney wondered whether she was right. \u201cFor the first few months, I had bruises and blood blisters on my hands and fingers,\u201d Delaney says. \u201cI got mosquito bites from being outside so much. I got torn up.\u201d\n  To break up the monotony of practice, she started imagining more intricate targets. She launched a TikTok account called Freedom and Feathers, and made a video in which she  shot a swinging tic tac into a tic-tac-toe board. She has used arrows to  light a match and  blow out a candle. In her most popular video, which has more than 7 million views, she tosses a tennis ball in the air and pierces it as it descends. Delaney does this on top of her day job as a consultant, and estimates she spends between 30 minutes and a full weekend purchasing supplies and constructing targets. Filming the videos can take anywhere from a few minutes\u2014she shot through a Life Saver on her third try\u2014to a few days. And the process doesn\u2019t end there.\n Every time she posts a video to her nearly 1 million TikTok followers, Delaney sets a goal to respond to at least 50 comments. Even though she keeps a note on her phone with standard responses to FAQs, she can\u2019t ever clear her backlog of DMs. Still, she spends hours a day responding, because she sees how it inspires girls to get into the sport, and she wants to create a sense of community.\n \u201cHow do small sports become big ones? I got interested in that question because I really love disc golf,\u201d says Joshua Woods, a sociology professor at West Virginia who studies alternative sports and serves as the editor of the disc golf website  Parked. \u201cAnd that\u2019s part of the answer to the question: a critical mass of people become emotionally connected to a sport. People like Paul McBeth are getting paid because they can cut through the noise, and there\u2019s so much noise in the age of the internet. Passionate fans can feel like they\u2019re part of an intimate community.\u201d\n Even the most active NBA fans don\u2019t expect stars to respond to social media messages. (Unless they have talked shit about Kevin Durant, in which case they\u2019ll absolutely hear back. Hi, KD.) But the fans of niche sports sometimes feel a sense of ownership over those sports, and a sense of entitlement when interacting with their stars. Spending so much time sorting through comments can make it hard for those athletes to filter out the trolls. Delaney says that she gets daily sexist messages from men who claim what she does is easy. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018Big deal, someone has already done that particular shot.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Basketball players have made shots from every spot on the floor. That doesn\u2019t make a half-court shot any less impressive.\u2019\u201d\n \u201cSome people in my fan base can recite every single stunt I performed in those videos but don\u2019t know how many titles I\u2019ve won. Entertainment is king right now.\u201d \u2014Jason Belmonte\n When Belmonte first started bowling as a child, he couldn\u2019t lift the ball, so he pioneered the practice of bowling with both hands. While most players bowl using a single arm, Belmonte  uses both to improve his power and control. That style makes him stand out the way Rick Barry once did with his underhanded free throw shooting. When Belmonte began competing professionally, he was inundated with comments about his form. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how you can scroll right past a thousand positive comments and focus on the one negative comment you see,\u201d he says. \u201cIt took me a long time to learn how to deal with that.\u201d\n He later learned that some of those online trolls were actually his competitors in the lanes. He says that several times he\u2019s walked into the locker room\u2014yes, there are locker rooms for bowlers\u2014and overheard other bowlers whispering about how they\u2019d created burner accounts to harass him. \u201cI used to tell them \u2018Don\u2019t hide behind a username. Say it to my face.\u2019  Then they\u2019d deny it,\u201d Belmonte says. \u201cNow my reply is \u2018I have more of everything than you do. There\u2019s nothing you have that I would want.\u2019\u201d\n Belmonte also credits his unusual style for his success on social media. He\u2019s by far the most popular bowler across all of the major platforms, with 130,000 Instagram followers, 44,000 Twitter followers, and 66,000 YouTube subscribers. His bios online tout his unusual style, and his email signature reads, \u201cThis email was typed using #2HANDS.\u201d He has double-handedly changed the game of bowling for professionals and amateurs alike, many of whom trace their ability to enjoy the sport to his trailblazing style. That sense of community can be lucrative for Belmonte, who regularly releases  limited-edition merchandise for $25 to $60 on Instagram. He says those sales, which number in the thousands every year, provide \u201cfantastic supplementary income.\u201d\n \u201cIn niche sports, social media is 10 times\u2014maybe 100 times\u2014more important to an athlete than it is in mainstream sports,\u201d Belmonte says. \u201cMainstream sports stars get constant TV coverage. They\u2019re in people\u2019s faces all the time. If you\u2019re in a niche sport, you have to tell people what you have coming up and what you\u2019ve achieved. You want people to feel like they\u2019re a part of this journey.\u201d\n  As she was languishing last summer before her freshman year at Aquinas College in Michigan, volleyball player Chloe Mitchell decided\u2014like so many of us during the pandemic\u2014that she had seen just about enough of her family. Behind her house was a storage space with dusty walls and rusty bicycles, so she asked her parents for permission to convert it into a \u201cshe shed.\u201d She\u2019d recently gotten into TikTok, and posted a video documenting the change to her account. Within four days, it had accumulated a million views. By the time the shed was transformed, so too was her life. She had more than a million followers, and no idea what to do next.\n @chloevmitchell  It\u2019s DONEEEE! Thank you for watching the process and having fun with me. Check out the link in my bio if you want to see a longer she shed tour :))\n  \u266c Funky Town - The Dance Queen Group\n She didn\u2019t want to be a one-clip wonder, so she took a couple weeks off before coming back with a new project: remodeling the bathroom that she shared with her brother. \u201cI had this massive decrease in followers after the first project was finished,\u201d she says. \u201cBeing a TikTok star had  just happened, and it wasn\u2019t part of my identity. When my followers started going back up after my second project, I knew I could sustain something.\u201d\n  Mitchell\u2019s fame had nothing to do with volleyball. Nonetheless, NCAA name, image, and likeness (NIL) rules would have prevented her from collecting any profits from her social media success. During recruiting, Mitchell nearly committed to an NCAA Division II school, which would\u2019ve cost her dearly. Instead, she chose to compete at the NAIA level, which  granted athletes NIL rights in October 2020. Mitchell is now  believed to be the first college athlete to make money from endorsements. (Well,   legal money anyway.) Since then, she has earned enough to buy a laptop and a car, as well as pay off her student debt. She\u2019s saving up for her next project: flipping a house.\n As soon as this summer, NCAA athletes in states such as Florida and Mississippi will gain NIL rights. Sensing that seismic shift in the economics of college sports, Mitchell and her father, Keith, founded a company called PlayBooked. PlayBooked already has four full-time employees and has connected more than 130 NAIA athletes to paid social media sponsorship opportunities. Keith is so bullish on its prospects he turned down venture capital funding and predicts that there will be a PlayBooked Bowl by 2025.\n For athletes in niche sports, their college tenures often represent the peak of their popularity. Being able to make endorsement money, then, would be an absolute game-changer. \u201cThe riches,\u201d Keith says, \u201care in the niches.\u201d\n Myles Jones first started getting interested in Instagram while he was playing lacrosse at Duke. Every time his team played on ESPNU, he\u2019d return to his phone to discover a few hundred additional followers. He was majoring in marketing at the time, and wanted to test his ability to build his own brand. He was so successful that on the day after his 2016 graduation, STX Lacrosse representatives flew out to ink him to an endorsement deal. Within a few months, he\u2019d also signed with Adidas and made a few thousand dollars for promoting a protein powder on Instagram.\n \u201cIn niche sports, social media is 10 times\u2014maybe 100 times\u2014more important to an athlete than it is in mainstream sports. You want people to feel like they\u2019re a part of this journey.\u201d \u2014Jason Belmonte\n In November, Jones signed a major endorsement deal with Degree. He declined to reveal the exact dollar figure involved, but said he thought his agent had typed an extra zero at the end of the number when he read the text confirming the details. Yet Jones says the meaning of the deal was as significant as the money. \u201cI was stepping into the non-endemic space. A lot of what guys are selling in lacrosse is equipment\u2014sticks and goals. I felt like I was bridging the gap between a small sport and the mainstream culture. You can\u2019t buy lacrosse gear at the supermarket, but everybody needs deodorant.\u201d\n Even in mainstream sports, most athletes rely on apparel companies like Nike or Adidas as their primary sponsors. And while deals like LeBron James\u2019s lifetime contract with Nike make national headlines, most athletes have what are known as merchandise deals. They don\u2019t get money, but they get as many products as they want. Only the big names receive cash deals, and even then the payout\u2014in the low six figures, if they\u2019re lucky\u2014is generally pennies compared to their contracts. Only the megastars make millions from endorsements.\n Yet while mainstream athletes often live off their sport salaries alone, niche sport athletes typically have to rely on multiple income streams.

But  faced with five antitrust bills that could unwind  what the House Judiciary Committee described as Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook\u2019s \u201cmonopoly power,\u201d Big Tech is bringing out the big lobbying guns.\n Apple CEO Tim Cook himself called Speaker Nancy Pelosi to \u201cdeliver a warning\u201d that that the \u201crushed\u201d antitrust bills could disrupt the iPhone,  according to  The New York Times , and that\u2019s not all:\n \u201cExecutives, lobbyists, and more than a dozen think tanks and advocacy groups paid by tech companies have swarmed Capitol offices, called and emailed lawmakers and their staff members, and written letters arguing there will be dire consequences for the industry and the country if the ideas become law,\u201d the NYT wrote.\n There\u2019s a growing sense that the current administration has a genuine interest in combating tech monopolies \u2014 a point perhaps made most clearly when Biden chose prominent antitrust scholar and Amazon critic Lina Khan to lead the Federal Trade Commission.  She was sworn in last week.\n  It\u2019s not unusual for tech companies to dive deeper into lobbying these days, as you\u2019d expect now that they\u2019re the most valuable companies in the world, and we\u2019ve seen their outsize influence overwhelm voters and legislators at the local level before. Uber and Lyft won big  after backing the most expensive measure in California history, using their own apps  as an unfair advantage, and Arizona\u2019s controversial app store bill  mysteriously disappeared after tech companies stepped in. An Apple lobbyist managed to  scare California legislators away from a right-to-repair bill in 2019, too.\n Pelosi apparently wasn\u2019t having it, though, at least not on the call.

", "note_en": "Programming     My previous article, \u201c We don\u2019t need a string type\u201c, caused a bit of stir. Though the feedback is mixed, there is a common theme of a string being a useful feature. After doing a bit more research I can determine only one thing: most current string types are broken!\n Many of us believe our strings are capable of more than what they actually do. We rely on their functionality without actually checking that its valid. This can easily lead to programs which do not work correctly, particularly with respect to internationalization. In most cases it seems we would be better off without a string type.\n  I looked at how strings behave in a few basic situations. I\u2019ll go over each situation, giving the expected result and some of the actual results. I considered showing a matrix with the results, but since all the tested languages behave so poorly it didn\u2019t seem useful.\n  Using the text \u201cnoe\u0308l\u201d with a decomposed Unicode string \u201cnoe\\u0308l\u201d, I checked the following:\n 1. Does it print correctly? Yes, most languages are capable of doing this. Though the ideone.com interface seems to break the output (so be careful with testing).\n 2. What is the reverse? \u201cl\u00ebon\u201d, correct? Mostly this fails. The most common result is \u201cl\u0308eon\u201d (the dieresis is on the \u2018l\u2019 instead of the \u2018e\u2019). This is what happens without a string class, by just reversing an array of code points.\n 3. What are the first three characters? Mostly the answer here is \u201cnoe\u201d, as opposed to the desired \u201cno\u00eb\u201d. This could easily lead into a big discussion about what a character is, but I assume most people would not be happy with the current result. This is again indicative of a string type which merely treats the data as an array of code points.\n 4. What is the length? The common answer is 5. And yet again, this indicates our string types are merely arrays of characters and not truly handling the text.\n For all of these questions, try to consider what should happen if you were editing this text in your favourite word processor or text editor. I generally expect that the \u2018\u00eb\u2019 character is handled as a single entity. I don\u2019t expect backspace/delete to just remove part of the letter. I expect copying the first three letters to include the accent.\n  It was a bit weird to find out that Unicode has cats in it (I hope you have a font which shows them \u2014 if not, the title of this section is a happy cat and a sad cat, part of the Unicode emoticon set). These characters were chosen since they are outside of the BMP (basic multilingual plane). This spells trouble for languages using UTF-16 encodings (Java, C#, JavaScript).\n 1. Length? Python unicode correctly reports 2. Those UTF-16 languages tend to report 4: the characters require surrogate pairs.\n 2. Substring after the first character? Python unicode correctly reports the sad cat \u201c\ud83d\ude3e\u201d. The UTF-16 languages produce invalid strings with a half-surrogate followed by the sad cat.\n 3. Reverse? Python unicode gets the correct reverse of \u201c\ud83d\ude3e\ud83d\ude38\u201d. The UTF-16 languages produce invalid strings. With C# I think I uncovered a defect in ideone. It doesn\u2019t even show the invalid string and instead shows no output at all for the entire program! [ ideone defect]\n Languages using an encoding agnostic library, like C++, Perl, and normal Python 2 strings, fail here as well. They ignore any encoding and assume the string is an array of 1-byte code points. Python 3 adopted unicode as the default string type, thus fixing some problems. It appears that Perl also has a \u2018utf8\u2019 mode which fixes problems for these cats, but not for the \u201cno\u00ebl\u201d string.\n  This string contains a ligature character, the \u201cffl\u201d part is a single unicode code point. They exist mainly for compatibility, but they are a good test for case conversion.\n 1. What is the uppercase? I did not find any language which doesn\u2019t print \u201cBA\ufb04E\u201d. Notice the ligature remains lowercase. The expected answer is of course \u201cBAFFLE\u201d.\n Unicode has a special class of case conversion: this single ligature code point is actually converted to three code points. By not following these additional rules, a language uppercase function produces an interesting result: a string converted to uppercase still has lowercase characters in it.\n  A final check I did was to compare two logically equivalent strings with different composition forms. Here \u201cno\u00ebl\u201d is using the precomposed \u201c\u00eb\u201d character.\n 1. Is precomposed == decomposed? The answer is no in all tests. However, several languages do offer Unicode normalization libraries. In those languages the normal form of the strings does compare equal. JavaScript does not have such a library, which is really tragic because it\u2019s primarily a UI language, exactly where\u2019d you want proper unicode functionality.\n It\u2019s tempting to argue that normalization and lexical analysis is not part of the basic string type. But these seem like fundamental operations one would want to do with text. If they aren\u2019t included, what exactly is the purpose of the string type?\n  I encourage you to run such tests in your favourite language. If you are doing work with international text it is vital that you understand what your \u2018string\u2019 type is actually doing. Once you\u2019ve run this you should reconsider what your \u201cstring\u201d type is actually doing for you. In my opinion they\u2019re all broken.\n I admit the correct answer is not always clear. Text processing is a difficult topic, and at the very minimum we\u2019d have to cover grapheme clusters (some string classes expose functionality relating to this, and Perl even has a GCString class). This is beyond the scope of this article, but very relevant for a good string type.\n The point I made in my previous article becomes more poignant. I\u2019d rather have an array of characters than a broken string class. I don\u2019t put any false expectations on an array of characters: the results it produces for the above tests are very logical.

Clinically, the life-long presence of the parasite in tissues of a majority of infected individuals is usually considered asymptomatic. However, a number of studies show that this \u2018asymptomatic infection\u2019 may also lead to development of other human pathologies.\n The purpose of the study was to collect available geoepidemiological data on seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis and search for its relationship with mortality and disability rates in different countries.\n Prevalence data published between 1995\u20132008 for women in child-bearing age were collected for 88 countries (29 European). The association between prevalence of toxoplasmosis and specific disease burden estimated with age-standardized Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) or with mortality, was calculated using General Linear Method with Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDP), geolatitude and humidity as covariates, and also using nonparametric partial Kendall correlation test with GDP as a covariate. The prevalence of toxoplasmosis correlated with specific disease burden in particular countries explaining 23% of variability in disease burden in Europe. The analyses revealed that for example, DALY of 23 of 128 analyzed diseases and disease categories on the WHO list showed correlations (18 positive, 5 negative) with prevalence of toxoplasmosis and another 12 diseases showed positive trends (p&lt;0.1). For several obtained significant correlations between the seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis and specific diseases/clinical entities, possible pathophysiological, biochemical and molecular explanations are presented.\n The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis correlated with various disease burden. Statistical associations does not necessarily mean causality. The precautionary principle suggests however that possible role of toxoplasmosis as a triggering factor responsible for development of several clinical entities deserves much more attention and financial support both in everyday medical practice and future clinical research.\n Toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by the obligate apicomplexan intracellular protozoan  Toxoplasma gondii, is one of the world&#39;s most common parasites infecting most genera of warm-blooded animals (more than 30 species of birds and 300 species of mammals). It is the most prevalent infection in humans (estimated to be 30\u201350% of the world population), more than latent tuberculosis which infects about one-third of the human population (WHO,  www.who.int/entity/tb/publications/2009/tbfactsheet_2009update_one_page.pdf, accessed July 2013). The definitive hosts are representatives of the felid (cat) family. Nicolle and Manceaux (1908) first observed the parasites in the blood and tissues of a North African rodent,  Ctenodactylus gondii, and named it  Toxoplasma (arclike form)  gondii (after the rodent host)  [1]. There are three infective stages of  T. gondii: a) a rapidly dividing invasive tachyzoite; b) a slowly dividing bradyzoite in tissue cysts, which can persist inside human cells for protracted periods; and c) an environmental stage, the sporozoite, protected inside an oocyst. The oocysts, remarkably stable environmentally, are transmitted to other hosts through inadvertent ingestion.\n Seroprevalence is a measure of the accumulated exposure during a person&#39;s lifetime in a particular social setting. Most of the more than one third of the world&#39;s human population who are infected with  T. gondii remain asymptomatic because the immune system usually keeps the parasite from causing illness. Chronic, usually lifelong, infection with  Toxoplasma that is not accompanied with overt clinical symptoms of toxoplasmosis disease is termed latent toxoplasmosis while chronic infection associated with continuous or recurrent clinical symptoms is termed chronic toxoplasmosis (this form of disease is relatively rare in Europe and Northern America). Worldwide seroprevalence of the parasite measured by specific anti- Toxoplasma IgG antibodies varies between 1% and 100% depending on the environmental and socioeconomic conditions, including eating habits and health-related practices  \u2013 , general level of hygiene, host susceptibility, geographical location (geolatitude) and humidity of the soil. The incidence of infection is higher in warmer and humid climates and increases with age  . The lowest seroprevalence (\u223c1%) was found in some countries in the Far East and the highest (&gt;90%) in some parts of European and South American countries. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported an overall seroprevalence of 11% [National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey between 1999 and 2004]; another survey reported a higher number (22.5%)  . Nevertheless, toxoplasmosis is one of the leading causes of death attributed to foodborne illness  . In European countries, the prevalence ranges between 10% to 60%, and in some regions as high as 90%  [8]. In one study, 84% of pregnant women had serum antibodies against the parasite  [3]. Data from 88 countries are presented in   Table 1; most of the published data on seroprevalence are in women of childbearing age and/or those who are pregnant.\n The second and third column show prevalence of toxoplasmosis and prevalence adjusted to a standard age of 22 years to account for variation in childbearing age in across countries (column 1) using the formula Prevalence adj\u200a=\u200a1\u2212(1\u2212Prevalence)\u2227(22/childbearing age)  . Column 5 shows year(s) when the study was performed and column 6 shows number of women in the sample. For Macedonia, the 2004 WHO data were not available therefore this 30 th European country was not included in our data set.\n In the majority of the human populations, the parasite seroprevalence increases with age, and may vary by gender  ,  [94]. Latitudinal variability in the geoseroprevalence of the parasite may be due to local rainy conditions (because oocysts live longer in humid conditions), and low altitude regions (especially at mid-latitudes); a north-south seroprevalence gradient has also been reported in animals  ,  ,  .\n The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis is high in immunocompromised patients, such as those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and transplant or cancer patients treated with immunosuppressive agents  ,  ,  .\n It may be pointed out that the different serological methods used to obtain prevalence data are not standardized, and vary in sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. As a consequence, no two tests produce the same results in all cases, even when carried out in the same laboratory  .\n T. gondii strains are highly diverse but only a few lineages are widely spread. Different genotypes of the parasite show great diversity in pathogenicity and drug sensitivity. Some atypical strains have also been detected. In Europe, North America, and Africa, there are three dominant clonal lineages of  T. gondii called type I (RH, GT1,CAST), type II (ME49, WIL, HART), and type III (VEG, MOO, SOU), as well as many atypical genotypes which differ in prevalence, virulence, migratory capacity within the host, and ability to convert to the bradyzoite cyst phase  \u2013 . Different strains of the parasite induce different cytokine responses  , thus triggering development of various clinical and biochemical disturbances in the host, including modulation of the host cell proteome  ,  . Mice fed as few as 1 oocyst of  T. gondii serotype I and several atypical strains died of acute toxoplasmosis within 21 days post inoculation, while some  T. gondii type II, and III strains were less virulent  . In North America, the parasite serotype II and NE-II causes congenital toxoplasmosis, while prematurity and severity of disease at birth was associated with the coccidian NE-II serotype  . This serotype was also associated with rural residence, lower socioeconomic status and Hispanic ethnicity (P&lt;0.01\u20130.001)  . A greater variety of genotypes are found in South America and Africa than in North America and Europe  ,  , suggesting that in these continents sexual replication of the parasite occurs more frequently than in any other part of the world  . This genetic divergence may contribute to the higher prevalence of seropositivity and ocular disease due to  T. gondii, as exemplified by the higher prevalence of toxoplasmosis and  Toxoplasma-induced eye disease in southern Brazil than in any other part of the world  .\n Animals are infected by eating infected animals, by ingestion of or coming in contact with feces of an infected cat, or by transmission from mother to fetus. In humans, cats are the primary source of infection (contact with fecal material), but other pets may also be the secondary source of infection  [3],  ,  [112]. The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in the Arctic region proves that  T. gondii can thrive in the absence of cats  [113].\n Contact with raw meat of infected animals, especially pork, is a more significant source of human infections in some countries, such as in Poland, where the majority of pigs, cattle and sheep (approximately 80%) test positive for  T. gondii [8],  . Transmission of the parasite can also occur by drinking municipal/well unboiled and unbottled water containing oocysts, exposure to contaminated soil, contaminated milk, exposure of children playing in sandpits, geophagia  ,  , eating raw or undercooked meat, especially venison   or rabbits  , raw oysters, clams, or mussels  , consumption of unwashed raw fruits and vegetables contaminated with the oocytes  , blood transfusion  \u2013 , maternal-fetal passage of blood cells (including placental trophoblasts)  [123],  , solid organ allografts  ,  , bone marrow transplantation  , allogeneic stem cell transplantation  , sputum  , breast milk  ,  , and semen   (thus, probably the infection may be transmitted via both vaginal and oral sex, significantly more frequently from seropositive to passive sex partner than vice-versa (P&lt;0.001)  [133]). Poor hygiene, lower socioeconomic status and less education, as well as exposure to certain strains of  T. gondii may also contribute to a higher rate of infection  .\n T. gondii is remarkable in its ability to invade a wide variety of host cells. Invasion is an active process relying on parasite motility and the sequential secretion of proteins from secretory organelles, the micronemes, rhoptries, and the dense granules.  T. gondii can invade and multiply inside any nucleated cell type including epithelial cells and blood leukocytes  . A preference to infect and multiply inside myeloid cells  in vitro has also been reported  , and several studies in mice indicate that the dendritic cells as well as monocytes/macrophages function as systemic parasite transporters (\u201cTrojan horses\u201d) during infection  \u2013 . The parasite can be transmitted from infected dendritic cells to NK cells  , and thus, low levels of NK cells found in pregnant women may suggest transmission of the parasite  . Differential infectivity and division rate of intracellular tachyzoites in human peripheral blood leukocytes and other primary human cells  in vitro has been demonstrated depending on the cell characteristics  .\n It is believed that the majority of immunocompetent individuals infected with  T.  gondii remain asymptomatic or have a subclinical course with minor symptoms  . It is nevertheless the most common food-borne parasitic infection requiring hospital treatment  , and the third most common cause of hospitalization due to food-borne infection  . Both competent and immunocompromised persons can develop the disease, especially retinochoroiditis (ocular toxoplasmosis)  ,  ,  . In non-pregnant immunocompetent adults, acute disease may also lead to impaired eye sight  ,  . For example, in the United States, one million new infections occur each year, which result in approximately 20 000 cases of retinal pathology  . Primary infection in pregnant women is a matter of great concern, since it can be transmitted to the fetus leading to spontaneous abortion or stillbirth. A newborn exposed to  T. gondii in utero may develop congenital toxoplasmosis with major ocular and neurological consequences. In immunosuppressed (HIV, organ transplant or cancer) patients, the infection can lead to life-threatening cerebral toxoplasmosis  ,  ,  .\n Symptomatic infection with the parasite can be categorized into four groups: 1) cervical lymphadenopathy, headache, fever, sore throat, and myalgia, with possibility of splenomegaly and brief erythematous (maculopapular) rash; 2) typhus-like exanthematous form with myocarditis, meningoencephalitis, atypical pneumonia and possibly death; 3) retinochoroiditis, which may be severe, requiring enucleation; and 4) central nervous system involvement  [153]. In addition, several reports suggest that  T. gondii infection may be responsible for additional wide range of symptoms, and development of several clinical entities (summarized in   Table 2).\n  Some of the clinical manifestations of  T. gondii infection may be as a result of extensive interaction of the pathogen with approximately 3000 host genes or proteins possibly because of frequent host/pathogen antigen homology that disrupts/creates/triggers host specific metabolic pathways, and finally contributes to the development of endophenotypes of different diseases  . The parasite and concomitant viral and/or bacterial infections scavenge important metabolites from host cells and/or donate other compounds to the host causing unwanted effects. In addition,  T. gondii-derived autoantibodies also play an important role in the pathology associated with the parasite  .\n Due to the fact that  T. gondii infection is omnipresent and associated with development of many pathologies in humans and animals, including the disease burden of congenital toxoplasmosis, as represented by disability-adjusted life years (DALY) being the highest among all foodborne pathogens  , the purpose of this work was to collectively evaluate available geoepidemiological data on the parasite worldwide national seroprevalence variations and their relationship with mortality and disability rates. In the analyses, gross domestic product (GDP)  per capita as a covariate was used because earlier it was argued and demonstrated that culture-level correlations need to be controlled for regional socioeconomic parameters  ,  ,  . If possible (i.e. in multivariate GLM analyses), two potential confounding variables that could strongly influence both the survival of  Toxoplasma oocysts in soil and a course of various diseases, namely the average latitude (proxy for temperature) and the average relative humidity of particular countries have also been included into the statistical models. In this study we found many positive and some negative associations between the prevalence of toxoplasmosis and various diseases burdens. The number and strength of these associations were much higher than could be expected by chance. Still, it must be emphasized that statistical association does not mean causality. Based on the finding of a statistical association between two phenomena, one cannot determine which of them is the cause and which is the effect \u2013 in other words, whether event A causes event B, or whether event B causes event A. Not only we are unable to determine whether event A causes B, or B causes A, but sometimes there is an (unknown) event C that causes both A and B. Therefore, all effects observed in the present exploratory study as well as all suggested biological or medical interpretations must be considered just as potential stimuli for the next, more focused research (search for unknown confounders and for independent evidence) that must follow.\n The data on disease burden, mortality and Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY), were obtained from the table \u201cMortality and Burden of Diseases Estimates for WHO Member States in 2004\u201d published by WHO  [323] and available at:  www.who.int/evidence/bod. The publication can be downloaded from the website:  http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/2004_report_update/en/index.html; accessed July 2013). Summary tables present the best estimates of WHO \u2013 based on the evidence available in mid-2008 \u2013 rather than from the official estimates of Member States.  Methods and data sources are summarized in the Annexes of the \u201cGlobal burden of disease: 2004 update\u201d  [323], and the methodology used is described in more details elsewhere  [324]; also available at:  http://www.dcp2.org/pubs/GBD; accessed July 2013.\n The Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) has been defined  [323] as \u201ca health gap measure that extends the concept of potential years of life lost due to premature death and also to include equivalent years of \u2018healthy\u2019 life lost by virtue of being in a state of poor health or disability.\u201d Thus, the DALY combines in one measure the time lived with disability and the time lost due to premature mortality. One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of \u2018healthy\u2019 life, while the \u2018burden of disease\u2019 as a measure of the gap between current health status and an ideal situation where everyone lives into old age free of disease and disability. The method of calculation of age-standardized DALY has been described earlier  [323].\n In the literature, most of toxoplasmosis prevalence (seroprevalence) data are available only for women in childbearing age. Therefore, all available data collected for this population were published mostly between 1995\u20132008; the final database was obtained from 88 countries (29 European). When more than one estimation of prevalence of toxoplasmosis was available for a particular country, we gave priority to multicenter studies performed between 1998\u20132004. When the studies published different prevalence data for various regions or different years we calculated an unweighted arithmetic mean. The obtained data were adjusted to a standard age 22 years to eliminate differences in prevalence caused by different childbearing ages in various countries   were kindly provided by Mudhakar Dama) using the formula:\n All statistical tests except partial Kendall correlation test were performed independently with SPSS 21 and Statistica 10.0. The association between seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis and specific disease burden estimated with age standardized DALY was calculated using nonparametric partial Kendall correlation test  [326],   with Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDP) as covariate. Because the results of similar analyses performed with the General Linear Model (GLM) method were qualitatively the same, GLM data were primarily interpreted in the Discussion section of present study. The GLM is more sensitive for the quality of data (e.g. to presence of outliers and non-Gaussian distribution of data, etc.), however, it enables to control for more than one covariate. In the present analysis, we controlled for GDP, geographical latitude and annual mean of relative humidity of particular countries using data available at  http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD (accessed 10.12. 2013) and  http://www.climatemps.com/ (accessed 2.4. 2013). No formal corrections for multiple tests were carried out, however, the fraction of significant results largely exceeded a theoretical value of 5 false positive results per 100 tests.\n The medical importance of the association was expressed as regression coefficient \u2018B\u2019, the slope of the regression line. The higher is the absolute value of B the greater is the positive or negative impact of the predictor variable (here prevalence of toxoplasmosis)\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-23 10:00:48", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5168\u7403,global,\u6570\u636e", "title": "\u5f13\u5f62\u866b\u75c5 - \u5168\u7403\u5a01\u80c1 ", "title_en": "Toxoplasmosis \u2013 A Global Threat", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3963851/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5168\u7403", "global", "\u6570\u636e"]}]
