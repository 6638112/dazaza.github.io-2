Some of these assumptions are: The leagues have to be fair and balanced. The leagues have to be of similar size, if not identical size. Leagues must follow the same rules. Teams must play a large number of games against other teams within their league, if not all of their games. All games played should have equal value.</p><p>美国的体育联赛是建立在许多球迷认为理所当然的、在许多情况下被视为神圣的几个假设之上的。其中一些假设是：联盟必须公平和平衡。联盟的规模必须相似，如果不是相同的话。联盟必须遵循同样的规则。球队必须与联盟内的其他球队进行大量比赛，如果不是全部比赛的话。所有的游戏都应该有同等的价值。</p><p> These assumptions, among others, have created the landscape of American sports. But you can violate many if not all of these assumptions while maintaining a compelling league. One which may, in fact, be more fair and lead to a superior product with more exciting outcomes. Here, I will try to dismantle the current structure of major league baseball and create a new system whereby both fans and teams may have a more equitable, exciting, and compelling end product. Some of the rule changes I will propose are wordy, but I would argue none of them are very complicated. I believe any fan would be able to easily follow and understand the end product just as well as they follow and understand the current major league product.</p><p>这些假设，以及其他假设，创造了美国体育的景观。但你可以在保持一个令人信服的联盟的同时，违反许多（如果不是全部的话）这些假设。事实上，这可能会更公平，并带来更令人兴奋的结果的优质产品。在这里，我将试图打破目前美国职业棒球大联盟的结构，创建一个新的体系，让球迷和球队都能拥有一个更公平、更激动人心、更令人信服的最终产品。我将提出的一些规则修改是冗长的，但我认为它们都不是很复杂。我相信任何球迷都能够轻松地理解和理解最终产品，就像他们理解和理解当前的大联盟产品一样。</p><p> I want to stress that none of the rules I will be proposing will change the game of baseball. None of these rules will impact balls and strikes, base hits, defense, or anything else. The DH is irrelevant, as are shifting, robo umps, drafting, and instant replay. The rules I am proposing are entirely limited to the overall STRUCTURE of the league. Who plays who, who makes the postseason, and things of that nature.</p><p>我想强调的是，我提出的任何规则都不会改变棒球比赛。这些规则都不会影响球和打击、安打、防守或其他任何东西。DH是不相关的，比如移动、机器人ump、绘图和即时回放。我提议的规则完全限于联盟的整体结构。谁打谁，谁打季后赛，以及诸如此类的事情。</p><p>   In order to form a new structure, we must demolish the existing structure. The American League and its three corresponding divisions will no longer exist. Neither will the National League and its three corresponding divisions. We are now left with 30 independent teams.</p><p>为了形成一个新的结构，我们必须拆除现有的结构。美国联赛及其相应的三个分区将不复存在。国家联盟及其相应的三个分部也不会。我们现在剩下30个独立的团队。</p><p> American sports leagues, up to this point, have had two pretty significant assumptions. First, every team must be in a league. Which is an assumption that I will maintain. Second, every team can only be in one league. Well, my rules will most certainly cast aside that second point.</p><p>到目前为止，美国体育联盟有两个相当重要的假设。首先，每支球队都必须在联盟中。这是我将坚持的假设。第二，每支球队只能参加一个联赛。好吧，我的规则肯定会抛弃第二点。</p><p> Rather than an American League and a National League, there will be a Standard League and a Champions League. No, I am not married to these names. You can refer to them however you’d like. The name is largely irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.</p><p>与美国联赛和国家联赛不同，将有标准联赛和冠军联赛。不，我没有嫁给这些名字。你想怎么说就怎么说。这个名字在很大程度上与全局无关。</p><p> The Standard League will contain all 30 teams. The Champions League will be a little more complicated. Before I get into the details, I want to briefly cover what the Champions League will  mean:</p><p>标准联赛将包含所有30支球队。冠军联赛将会更加复杂。在我进入细节之前，我想简单介绍一下欧冠意味着什么：</p><p> Champions League games will have more valuable TV time slots and dates during the season.</p><p>本赛季冠军联赛比赛将有更多有价值的电视时段和日期。</p><p>    Professional athletes get paid very large sums of money, and they represent a large fraction of the expenses of a professional sports franchise. As such, when a team is not expected to perform well in a given season, the team faces a strong and persistent incentive to cut their losses via freezing spending and/or trading away existing contracts. Then, when the team is expected to perform well again, spending may increase to support the expected change in performance. This is a logical and rational response to the game environment, especially in a league like Major League Baseball which, in addition to this monetary incentive, also ties draft picks to the win/loss record. So, not only can a team save money by creating an inferior product, but they can be rewarded with increasing numbers of superior and low cost player talent.</p><p>职业运动员得到的报酬非常高，在职业体育特许经营的费用中，他们占了很大一部分。因此，当一支球队在某个赛季表现不佳时，球队将面临通过冻结支出和/或交易现有合同来减少损失的强烈而持久的激励。然后，当团队有望再次表现良好时，支出可能会增加，以支持预期的绩效变化。这是对比赛环境的合乎逻辑和理性的回应，尤其是在像美国职业棒球大联盟这样的联盟中，除了这种金钱激励之外，选秀权还与胜负记录挂钩。因此，一支球队不仅可以通过创造劣质产品来节省资金，还可以通过增加优秀和低成本球员的数量来奖励他们。</p><p> The Champions League format aims to deter this behavior by punishing teams who underperform for a long period of time. In other words, the Champions League represents all of the teams that have, at least in terms of game results,  tried to win over the prior five seasons.</p><p>冠军联赛的形式旨在通过惩罚长期表现不佳的球队来阻止这种行为。换句话说，冠军联赛代表了所有球队，至少在比赛结果方面，他们试图在过去五个赛季中获胜。</p><p>    That is it. If you win 84 games, you have a qualifying season. If you win 84 games in two out of three or three out of five seasons, you’re in.</p><p>就是这样。如果你赢了84场比赛，你就有一个资格赛赛季。如果你在三分之二或五分之三的赛季中赢得84场比赛，你就进入了。</p><p> So, for example, from 2011 to 2014 the Astros won 56, 55, 51, and 70 games respectively. In 2015, the Astros won 86 games, which was sufficient to win a slot in the AL Wild Card, where they defeated the Yankees. The Yankees had won 97, 95, 85, 84, and 87 wins in each of those five seasons, respectively.</p><p>例如，从2011年到2014年，阿童木队分别赢得了56场、55场、51场和70场比赛。2015年，阿童木队赢得了86场比赛，这足以在艾尔外卡赢得一个位置，他们在那里击败了洋基队。洋基队在这五个赛季中分别赢了97场、95场、85场、84场和87场。</p><p> The Astros tanking during the 2011 through 2014 seasons would have eliminated them from the Champions League for this 2015 season. Meanwhile, the Yankees were definite members of the Champions league. I have not yet explained the exact benefit of the Champions League, but suffice it to say, the goal is to stop teams like the 2015 Astros from having an easy ride into the postseason. Furthermore, the 2016 Astros would have not been in the Champions League, either, as a result of their ongoing punishment for tanking. However, because the Astros won 84 games in 2016 giving them two qualified seasons in a row, the 2017 Astros would have indeed been members of the Champions League. As would each Astros team in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023.</p><p>在2011年到2014年的赛季中，阿童木队的坦克将在2015年的冠军联赛中淘汰他们。同时，洋基队是冠军联赛的绝对成员。我还没有解释冠军联赛的确切好处，但我只想说，我们的目标是阻止像2015年阿斯特罗斯这样的球队轻松进入季后赛。此外，2016年的阿童木队也不会参加冠军联赛，因为他们一直在因坦克而受到惩罚。然而，由于阿童木队在2016年赢得了84场比赛，连续两个赛季获得资格赛，2017年的阿童木队将成为冠军联赛的成员。在2018, 2019, 2020、2021, 2022和2023时，每一个阿斯特罗斯团队都会这样做。</p><p> As you see, even if the Astros began tanking today, the fact that they had tried to win between 2015 and 2021 would carry a benefit for several seasons into the future. Long enough for a team to retool, for example. Or to wait out unlucky or unfortunate seasons. But once that carry over effect has expired, a losing team will be punished, and the longer they lose, the more the punishment will carry over. To a maximum of two seasons.</p><p>正如你所看到的，即使太空人今天开始坦克，事实上他们试图在2015到2021之间获胜会在未来几个赛季带来好处。例如，足够长的时间让团队重新装备。或者等待不幸或不幸的季节。但一旦这种结转效应失效，输球的球队将受到惩罚，输球的时间越长，惩罚将继续下去。最多两季。</p><p> The goal is to incentivize teams who are on the cusp of 84 wins to spend more money and resources winning games so they stay in the Champions League and keep the benefits thereof. The increased incentive will hopefully create a more competitive league, which will in turn be more fun for the fans of the sport.</p><p>我们的目标是激励那些即将赢得84场比赛的球队花更多的钱和资源去赢得比赛，这样他们就可以留在冠军联赛中，并从中受益。增加的激励将有望创造一个更具竞争力的联赛，这将反过来为这项运动的球迷带来更多乐趣。</p><p>   It might not be immediately obvious how many teams will be in the Champions League merely by looking at these rules. From 2010 through 2022 you have 16, 17, 11, 14, 15, 17, 15, 18, 16, 12, 16, 13, and 14 teams in the Champions League, respectively. So, in eight of the seasons you have at least half of the teams in the Champions League, an average of 14.9 teams per season.</p><p>仅仅从这些规则来看，可能无法立即看出有多少球队将进入冠军联赛。从2010年到2022年，冠军联赛中分别有16支、17支、11支、14支、15支、15支、18支、16支、12支、16支、13支和14支球队。所以，在八个赛季中，至少有一半的球队参加了冠军联赛，平均每个赛季14.9支球队。</p><p>   Every team is in the Standard League. Only qualified teams are in the Champions League. You may be thinking how this could work. Here is how.</p><p>每个队都在标准联赛中。只有合格的球队才能进入冠军联赛。你可能在想这是怎么回事。下面是方法。</p><p> Any series that  begins on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday is a Standard League series. Any Series that  ends on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday is a Champion’s League series. This means that Thursday games are a wild card, where sometimes it is a weekday game and sometimes it is a weekend game. Judging by past seasons, teams average 97.07 weekend games versus 64.92 weekday games. If these rules were implemented, you could set a firm 97 Champion League games versus 65 Standard games.</p><p>任何在周一、周二或周三开始的系列赛都是标准的联赛系列赛。任何在周五、周六或周日结束的系列赛都是冠军联赛系列赛。这意味着周四的比赛是一张外卡，有时是工作日的比赛，有时是周末的比赛。从过去几个赛季来看，球队平均周末比赛97.07场，而工作日比赛64.92场。如果这些规则得到实施，你可以确定97场冠军联赛比赛与65场标准比赛的对比。</p><p> All teams will play all games in both the Standard League and the Champions League, so all teams will still play 162 games. However, members of the Champions League get to benefit from their status, while non-members merely gain the wins and losses in their combined league standings at the end of the year.</p><p>所有球队都将参加标准联赛和冠军联赛的所有比赛，因此所有球队仍将参加162场比赛。然而，冠军联赛的成员可以从他们的地位中获益，而非成员只会在年底的联赛积分榜上获得胜负。</p><p> This means that every week every team will play multiple games in each league. Sometimes 2, sometimes 4, per league. Since they are different leagues, they each have different standings. This is where things can get very fun for both the team and the fans.</p><p>这意味着每个球队每周都会在每个联赛中打多场比赛。有时2，有时4，每个联赛。因为他们是不同的联赛，所以他们的排名各不相同。这对球队和球迷来说都是非常有趣的地方。</p><p> First, I will state the obvious. Under this format, weekend games are simply more valuable than weekday games. They also fall into their own schedule, with their own standings. Teams can aim to pack the stadiums full on the weekend, with both the players and fans knowing the games are worth more. This could increase fan engagement, and make rooting for teams more fun.</p><p>首先，我将陈述显而易见的事实。在这种模式下，周末游戏比平日游戏更有价值。他们也有自己的时间表，有自己的排名。球队的目标是在周末把体育场挤得满满的，球员和球迷都知道比赛更有价值。这可以增加球迷的参与度，让为球队加油更有趣。</p><p> Also, since weekend games are worth more, you can try to stack your lineup such that your best pitchers pitch on the weekend, your best hitters hit on the weekend, etc. On the flip side, since there are in effect two simultaneous, much shorter seasons going on, if a team gets off to a rough start in one league, they can shift their focus to the other.</p><p>此外，由于周末比赛的价值更高，你可以尝试堆叠你的阵容，以便你最好的投手在周末投球，你最好的击球手在周末击球，等等。另一方面，因为实际上有两个同时进行的、短得多的赛季，如果一支球队在一个联赛中起步不顺利，他们可以把注意力转移到对方身上。</p><p> For example, say a team wins 8 of their first 10 weekday games but loses 7 of their first 10 weekend games. Perhaps they could shift their focus to weekday games, where they could stack their starting pitchers to pitch during the week instead of on the weekend, doubling down on their Standard League strength and powering their way to a postseason berth in that manner.</p><p>例如，假设一支球队在前10个工作日的比赛中赢了8场，但在前10个周末的比赛中输了7场。也许他们可以把注意力转移到工作日的比赛上，他们可以把首发投手安排在本周而不是周末投球，在标准联赛实力的基础上加倍努力，以这种方式进入季后赛。</p><p> When you give teams more ways to make the postseason, you add layers of intrigue that fans can follow throughout the course of the season, keeping more people engaged, more people watching and attending games, and overall fan excitement high.</p><p>当你为球队提供更多进入季后赛的途径时，你就增加了球迷们在整个赛季都可以关注的兴趣层次，让更多的人参与进来，让更多的人观看和观看比赛，让球迷们整体兴奋不已。</p><p>  You may be wondering how you select postseason teams from two leagues. This is, again, relatively simple, although perhaps the most involved aspect of the dual league season.</p><p>你可能想知道如何从两个联赛中挑选季后赛球队。这也是相对简单的，尽管可能是双联赛赛季中最复杂的方面。</p><p> Of course, there are many ways you can go about doing this, and you may have your own opinion on the matter. But, assuming we keep with MLB’s current 10 postseason team format, I propose the following:</p><p>当然，有很多方法可以做到这一点，你可能对这件事有自己的看法。但是，假设我们保持MLB目前的10支季后赛球队模式，我建议如下：</p><p> You have three standings. First, the Champion’s League, second the Standard League, and third is the combined win total between both Champions League and the Standard league.</p><p>你有三个排名。首先是冠军联赛，第二是标准联赛，第三是冠军联赛和标准联赛的总冠军。</p><p> The two teams with the highest combined win total enter the postseason with the top two seeds. If you win the most games, you make the postseason.</p><p>两支总冠军数最高的球队以前两名种子进入季后赛。如果你赢得最多的比赛，你就能进入季后赛。</p><p> Next, you take the remaining top 6 qualified teams in the Champions League. The bottom 2 teams of these six must play a wild card game to advance.</p><p>接下来，你要看冠军联赛中剩下的前六名球队。这六支球队中排名倒数第二的球队必须打外卡才能晋级。</p><p> Finally, you take the remaining top 2 teams from the Standard League. These two teams must compete with the two lowest members of the Champions League in wild card games.</p><p>最后，从标准联赛中选出剩下的前2名球队。这两支球队必须在外卡比赛中与冠军联赛中排名最低的两名球员竞争。</p><p>   I have taken data from 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021. The past five years, excluding the shortened 2020 season. Of these seasons, 59 teams have qualified for the Champions League while 61 have not. Of the 59 teams that have qualified for the Champions League, in real life 26 of the teams have made the postseason. In the selection process I have outlined above, this jumps to 33. Nearly 56% of the Champions League teams would have made the postseason.</p><p>我已经从2017, 2018, 2019和2021获取数据。过去五年，不包括缩短的2020赛季。在这些赛季中，59支球队获得了欧冠资格，61支球队没有。在59支获得欧冠资格的球队中，现实生活中有26支球队进入了季后赛。在我上面概述的选择过程中，这个数字跳到了33。近56%的冠军联赛球队将进入季后赛。</p><p> Now looking at the 61 teams that were not in the Champions League, in real life 14 of these teams made the postseason, whereas under the rules I have outlined above this number drops to 7.</p><p>现在看看61支没有参加冠军联赛的球队，在现实生活中，这些球队中有14支进入了季后赛，而根据我上面概述的规则，这个数字下降到了7支。</p><p>  So, with these rules, on average, 1.75 teams are penalized per season, and their penalty is losing their position in the postseason. Furthermore, teams that are not in the Champions League only have access to four slots in the 10 team postseason, and while two of those slots are top seeds in the postseason, the other two are guaranteed wild card slots.</p><p>因此，根据这些规则，平均每个赛季有1.75支球队受到处罚，他们的处罚是失去季后赛的位置。此外，没有参加欧冠联赛的球队只能在10支球队的季后赛中获得4个名额，虽然其中两个名额是季后赛的头号种子，但其他两个名额保证是外卡名额。</p><p>   I propose a radical change to the structure of Major League Baseball: getting rid of the National and American league and replacing them with the Champions League and the Standard League. This would be a dual league structure, where every team plays games in both leagues, but only qualified members of the Champions League get to gain the benefits of that league. The primary benefit being a dramatically increased chance to make the postseason, along with significantly better odds to avoid the wildcard play in game.</p><p>我提议对美国职业棒球大联盟的结构进行一次彻底的改革：取消国家和美国联赛，代之以欧洲冠军联赛和标准联赛。这将是一个双联赛结构，每个球队都在两个联赛中比赛，但只有合格的冠军联赛成员才能获得该联赛的好处。主要的好处是大大增加了进入季后赛的机会，同时大大提高了避免比赛中出现通配符的几率。</p><p> This dual league structure gives teams more ways to make the postseason, and a strong incentive to maintain their status within the Champions League by ensuring a minimum of 84 wins every season. As a result, teams that are stuck in the dreaded “good enough to have a winning record, but not good enough to make the postseason” are regularly rewarded for their attempts to make a winning team, while at the same time providing a disincentive to push teams away teams from tanking for prolonged periods of time. One or two seasons to refresh might be deemed acceptable, but 3+ seasons would reset their Champions League status and create an uphill battle to make the postseason on the other end of their rebuild.</p><p>这种双联赛结构为球队提供了更多进入季后赛的途径，并通过确保每个赛季至少84场胜利来保持他们在冠军联赛中的地位。因此，陷入可怕的“好到足以赢得比赛记录，但不足以进入季后赛”的球队，会因为他们试图组建一支获胜的球队而定期获得奖励，同时也会抑制球队长时间远离失败的球队。一两个赛季的刷新可能被认为是可以接受的，但三个以上的赛季将重新设定他们的冠军联赛地位，并创造一个艰苦的战斗，使季后赛在重建的另一端。</p><p>  This is part I of a series of articles and essays on this topic.
