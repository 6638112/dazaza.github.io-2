Stockdale was a vice admiral and aviator who served for 37 years in the United States Navy, spending the majority of his time as a fighter pilot on aircraft carriers. Shot down on his third combat tour over North Vietnam, Stockdale was the senior-most navy prisoner of war in Hanoi, where he spent over seven years - four of them in solitary confinement and two in leg irons - before being released. He was awarded the Medal of Honor, along with 26 other combat decorations, and retired as an educator and author.</p><p>詹姆斯·B·斯托克代尔(James B.Stockdale)是一名海军中将和飞行员，在美国海军服役37年，大部分时间都是在航空母舰上担任战斗机飞行员。斯托克代尔是在北越上空第三次作战时被击落的，他是河内最资深的海军战俘，在获释之前，他在那里度过了七年多-其中四人被单独监禁，两人戴着脚铐。他被授予荣誉勋章，以及其他26个战斗勋章，并作为一名教育家和作家退休。</p><p>  Preparation and experience work most of the time - but not all of the time</p><p>准备和经验在大多数情况下是有效的，但不是所有时间都有效。</p><p> Stockdale had no reason to think that the day’s mission was to be anything unique.</p><p>斯托克代尔没有理由认为这一天的任务是独一无二的。</p><p> The flight in September 1965 was part of his third combat tour of North Vietnam, serving as Wing Commander of the aircraft carrier Oriskany. Despite his misgivings about the purpose of him being in Vietnam, he was a competent and skilled career fighter pilot. Nothing suggested he shouldn’t expect to make it back home that day - let alone that decade.</p><p>1965年9月的飞行是他第三次北越战斗之旅的一部分，他担任奥里斯卡尼号航空母舰的联队指挥官。尽管他对他在越南的目的感到疑虑，但他是一名称职和熟练的职业战斗机飞行员。没有任何迹象表明他不应该指望那天回家-更不用说那个十年了。</p><p> But sometimes life deals you a lousy hand, and it dealt Stockdale quite an unhappy one.</p><p>但是，有时生活给你发了一副糟糕的牌，给斯托克代尔带来了相当不愉快的一手。</p><p> While trying to aid trapped American soldiers on the ground, he was suddenly falling out of the sky and hurtling towards a small Vietnamese village. His plane was on fire, the control system shot out by North Vietnamese who had used the grounded soldiers as bait, and he didn’t have much choice beyond punching out of the plane.</p><p>当他试图帮助被困在地面的美国士兵时，他突然从天而降，冲向一个越南小村庄。他的飞机着火了，控制系统被以停飞士兵为诱饵的北越人射出，他别无选择，只能冲出飞机。</p><p> After ejection, I had about 30 seconds to make my last statement in freedom before I landed in the main street of a little village right ahead. And, so help me, I whispered to myself: &#34;Five years down there, at least. I&#39;m leaving the world of technology and entering the world of Epictetus.&#34;</p><p>弹射后，我有大约30秒的时间自由发表最后一次声明，然后降落在前面一个小村庄的主要街道上。所以，帮帮我吧，我低声对自己说：至少在那里呆了五年。我要离开科技世界，进入爱比克泰德的世界。</p><p> Just like that, Stockdale’s day had gone from routine to disastrous - but why was the first thing to jump into his mind the ancient philosopher, Epictetus?</p><p>就这样，斯托克代尔的日子从例行公事变成了灾难--但是为什么他首先想到的是古代哲学家爱比克泰德呢？</p><p> It is never too late to learn something that can be meaningful, sometimes so meaningful that it saves your life</p><p>学习一些有意义的东西永远不会太晚，有时甚至是非常有意义的东西，它可以拯救你的生命。</p><p> Five years previously, Stockdale had enrolled in the International Relations graduate program at Standford University. Twenty years in the Navy had given him the background needed to be a strategic planner in the Pentagon. But something wasn’t right - his heart wasn’t in it.</p><p>五年前，斯托克代尔参加了斯坦福大学的国际关系研究生课程。在海军工作20年给了他成为五角大楼战略规划者所需的背景。但是有些事情不对劲--他的心不在那上面。</p><p> He eventually landed in Stanford’s Philosophy department where he was introduced to Epictetus, amongst others. He took the study of philosophy to heart, and his decades of real-life military experience focused his attention on the “noble philosophy that has proven to be more practicable than a modern cynic would expect” - Stoicism.</p><p>他最终来到斯坦福大学哲学系，在那里他被介绍给爱比克泰德等人。他把哲学研究放在心上，他几十年的现实军事经历将他的注意力集中在“被证明比现代愤世嫉俗者预期的更实用的高尚哲学”-斯多葛主义上。</p><p> His bedside table on the aircraft carrier was no longer stacked with busy work to impress his superiors, but the “ Discourses, Xenophon&#39;s  Memorabilia, recollections of Socrates, and of course,  The Iliad and  The Odyssey.”</p><p>为了给上级留下深刻印象，他的床头柜上不再堆满了忙碌的工作，而是“谈话、色诺芬的纪念品、苏格拉底的回忆，当然还有”伊利亚特“和”奥德赛“。”</p><p> I came to the philosophic life as a 38-year-old Navy pilot in graduate school at Stanford University. I had been in the Navy for 20 years and scarcely ever out of a cockpit… Then I cruised into Stanford&#39;s philosophy corner one winter morning and met Philip Rhinelander, dean of humanities and sciences… Within 15 minutes, we had agreed that I would enter his two-term course in the middle. To make up for my lack of background, I would meet him for an hour a week for a private tutorial in the study of his campus home.</p><p>作为一名38岁的海军飞行员，我在斯坦福大学研究生院开始了哲学生活。我在海军服役了20年，几乎从未出过驾驶舱…。然后，一个冬天的早晨，我乘船来到斯坦福大学的哲学角，遇到了人文与科学学院院长菲利普·莱茵兰德(Philip Rhinelander)。不到15分钟，我们就达成协议，我将在中途参加他为期两个学期的课程。为了弥补我的背景不足，我每周会和他见面一小时，在他校园里的书房里进行私人辅导。</p><p> Phil Rhinelander opened my eyes. In that study, it all happened for me - my inspiration, my dedication to the philosophic life. From then on, I was out of international relations and into philosophy… On my last session, he reached high on his wall of books and brought down a copy of the   Enchiridion. He said, &#34;I think you’ll be interested in this.&#34;</p><p>菲尔·莱茵兰德让我睁开了眼睛。在那次研究中，这一切都发生在我身上-我的灵感，我对哲学生活的奉献。从那时起，我离开了国际关系学，进入了哲学…。在我的最后一次会议上，他高高地举起他的书墙，拿下了一本“Enchiridion”。他说，我想你会对这个感兴趣的。</p><p> Success is never certain, but suffering is - it is best to prepare for it</p><p>成功从来不是板上钉钉的事，但苦难是肯定的--最好为之做好准备。</p><p> But what was it about Epictetus and Stoicism that hit so close to home for Stockdale? Why did he think it more practical than other schools of thought?</p><p>但是，是什么让爱比克泰德和斯多葛学派如此贴近斯托克代尔的生活呢？为什么他认为它比其他学派更实用呢？</p><p> Epictetus is known amongst Stoic philosophers for his blunt advice - he referred to the lecture room not only as a place of learning, but as a hospital where you leave in pain but are better prepared for the future.</p><p>爱比克泰德在斯多葛派哲学家中以其直截了当的建议而闻名-他提到演讲室不仅是一个学习的地方，而且是一家医院，在那里你可以痛苦地离开，但更好地为未来做好准备。</p><p> One of Epictetus’s key messages is that the only thing guaranteed humans is that they will suffer. By being prepared to appropriately handle suffering, we will also be better prepared to humbly handle and appreciate any success. For a military man who had seen the brutality of war first hand for decades, you can imagine why such an acceptance of human frailty would be attractive.</p><p>埃皮克泰德的关键信息之一是，唯一能保证人类的是他们将遭受痛苦。准备好处理好苦难，也就更好地准备好谦虚地对待和欣赏任何成功。对于一个几十年来亲眼目睹战争残酷的军人来说，你可以想象为什么这样接受人类的脆弱会很有吸引力。</p><p> But further still, Epictetus lays the source of all that suffering on the suffering individual themselves. A disciplined mind, for the Stoics, along with taking personal responsibility for your orientation towards your situation, is the key to being able to get out of bed in the morning. In this way, you have control over yourself and your suffering without letting the world dictate it for you, regardless of the circumstances.</p><p>但是更进一步，爱比克泰德把所有这些痛苦的根源都放在了受苦的个体身上。对于斯多葛学派来说，纪律严明的头脑，以及对自己处境的定位承担个人责任，是早上能够起床的关键。通过这种方式，你可以控制自己和你的痛苦，而不是让世界为你发号施令，无论情况如何。</p><p> Epictetus explained that his curriculum was not about &#34;revenues or income, or peace or war, but about happiness and unhappiness, success and failure, slavery and freedom.&#34; His model graduate was not a person &#34;able to speak fluently about philosophic principles as an idle babbler, but about things that will do you good if your child dies, or your brother dies, or if you must die or be tortured. ...Let others practice lawsuits, others study problems, others syllogisms; here you practice how to die, how to be enchained, how to be racked, how to be exiled.&#34;</p><p>埃皮克泰德解释说，他的课程不是关于收入或收入，也不是关于和平或战争，而是关于幸福与不幸、成功与失败、奴役与自由。他的模范毕业生不是一个懒惰的喋喋不休的人，而是能够流利地谈论哲学原则的人，而是如果你的孩子死了，你的兄弟死了，或者你必须死了或受到折磨时，会对你有好处的事情。让别人打官司，让别人研究问题，让别人三段论；在这里，你练习如何死亡，如何被束缚，如何被拷打，如何被流放。</p><p> A man is responsible for his own &#34;judgments, even in dreams, in drunkenness, and in melancholy madness.&#34; Each individual brings about his own good and his own evil, his good fortune, his ill fortune, his happiness, and his wretchedness. It is unthinkable that one man&#39;s error could cause another&#39;s suffering; suffering, like everything else in stoicism, was all internal - remorse at destroying yourself.</p><p>一个人要对自己的判断负责，即使在梦中、醉酒时和忧郁的疯狂中也是如此。每个人都会带来他自己的善恶、他的好运、他的厄运、他的幸福和他的不幸。不可想象的是，一个人的错误会导致另一个人的痛苦；痛苦，就像斯多葛主义中的其他一切一样，都是对毁灭自己的内心悔恨。</p><p> Epictetus was telling his students that  there can be no such thing as being the &#34;victim&#34; of another. You can only be a &#34;victim&#34; of yourself. It&#39;s all in how you discipline your mind. Who is your master?&#34; He who has authority over any of the things on which you have set your heart. ...What is the result at which all virtue aims? Serenity. ...show me a man who though sick is happy, who though in danger is happy, who though in prison is happy, and I&#39;ll show you a Stoic.&#34;</p><p>埃皮克泰德告诉他的学生，不可能有成为另一个人的受害者这回事。你只能成为自己的受害者。这完全取决于你如何训练你的头脑。你的主人是谁？他对你一心想做的任何事情都有权柄。...所有美德所追求的结果是什么？宁静。给我找一个病了也快乐，危难中也快乐，在监狱里也快乐的人，我就给你看一个坚忍的人.。</p><p> Your status and security in life can change in an instant, so do not define yourself by what you are</p><p>你在生活中的地位和安全感可能会在瞬间发生变化，所以不要用你是什么来定义你自己</p><p> Back in September 1965, Stockdale can feel the bullets whistling past his head and into the parachute canopy above him.</p><p>早在1965年9月，斯托克代尔就能感觉到子弹从他头上呼啸而过，进入他头顶的降落伞伞盖。</p><p> Closer to the ground now he hears the shouting of villagers and can see the angry eyes, fists raised, looking up at him. His parachute catches on a tree near the main street, and but he hits the ground in relatively good shape.</p><p>现在离地面更近了，他听到了村民的喊叫声，可以看到愤怒的眼睛，举起拳头，抬头看着他。他的降落伞挂在主干道附近的一棵树上，但他的落地状态相对较好。</p><p> That outcome wasn’t acceptable to the unhappy villagers - so a group of ten or fifteen of them gang tackled Stockdale and beat him for over three minutes. He was saved by a policeman’s whistle, but a few broken bones and badly twisted and shattered leg were harbingers of what was to be the next seven years of his life.</p><p>这一结果对那些不高兴的村民来说是不可接受的，所以一群10到15人的帮派抓住了斯托克代尔，打了他三分钟多。他被警察的哨子救了下来，但几根骨折和严重扭伤的腿预示着他接下来的七年生活将会是什么样子。</p><p> As I glide down toward that little town on my short parachute ride, I&#39;m just about to learn how negligible is my control over my station in life. It&#39;s not at all up to me. Of course, I&#39;m going right now from being the Wing Commander, in charge of a thousand people (pilots, crewmen, maintenance men), responsible for nearly a hundred airplanes, and beneficiary of goodness knows all sorts of symbolic status and goodwill, to being an object of contempt. &#34;Criminal,&#34; I&#39;ll be known as.</p><p>当我坐着短暂的降落伞向那个小镇滑行时，我即将认识到，我对自己生活中的地位的控制是多么微不足道。这完全不是我能决定的。当然，我现在要从司令部司令，掌管一千人(飞行员、机组人员、维修员)，负责近百架飞机，善意的受益者，到成为众矢之的。罪犯，我将被称为。</p><p> And more than that even, you&#39;re going to face fragilities you never before let yourself believe could be true. [ See * at end of post, removed description of “taking the ropes” in case it is your preference to skip reading it] … that you can be made to blurt out answers, probably correct answers, to questions about anything they know you know. I&#39;m not going to pull you through that explanation again. I&#39;ll just call it &#34;taking the ropes.&#34;</p><p>更重要的是，你将面临你以前从未让自己相信可能是真的脆弱。[请参阅*在帖子末尾，删除了“走钢丝”的描述，以防您倾向于跳过阅读]…。你可以脱口而出答案，可能是正确的答案，关于他们知道你知道的任何问题。我不会再让你重复那个解释了。我就叫它收绳吧。</p><p> No, &#34;station in life&#34; can be changed from that of a dignified and competent gentleman of culture to that of a panic-stricken, sobbing, self-loathing wreck, maybe a permanent wreck if you have no will, in less than an hour. So what? So after you work a lifetime to get yourself all set up, and then delude Yourself into thinking that YOU have some kind of ownership claim on Your station in life, you&#39;re riding for a fall. You&#39;re asking for disappointment. To avoid that, stop kidding yourself, just do the best you can on a common-sense basis to make your station in life what you want it to be, but never get hooked on it. Make sure in your heart of hearts, in your inner self, that you treat your station in life with indifference. Not with contempt, only with indifference.</p><p>不，在不到一个小时的时间里，生活中的地位可以从一个有尊严、有能力的文化绅士转变为一个惊慌失措、哭泣、自我厌恶的失败者，如果你没有意愿，也许是一个永久性的失败者。那又怎么样？所以，在你工作了一辈子让自己做好一切准备，然后自欺欺人地认为你在生活中对自己的位置有某种所有权要求之后，你就是在堕落。你在自讨苦吃。为了避免这种情况，不要自欺欺人了，在常识的基础上尽你所能，让你的地位成为你想要的样子，但永远不要沉迷于它。确保在你的内心深处，在你的内在自我中，你对你生活中的地位漠不关心。不是轻蔑，只是漠不关心。</p><p> Shame at not living up to your own ideals is worse than a terrible situation itself</p><p>没有实现自己的理想而感到羞耻，这比可怕的情况本身更糟糕。</p><p> Torture was now a part of Stockdale’s daily life - as it was for any of the prisoners of war in North Vietnam. And that started with the first introduction to the Hanoi prisoner of war camp - you were broken down and isolated. The only way out of this pain was the betrayal of ideals you previously held - giving up military secrets, aiding in propaganda by admitting wrongdoing. Your reward for giving your captors what they wanted was to be isolated further for two months “to contemplated your crimes.”</p><p>酷刑现在是斯托克代尔日常生活的一部分-就像对北越的任何战俘一样。这始于河内战俘集中营的第一次介绍-你被瓦解和孤立。摆脱这种痛苦的唯一方法是背叛你以前持有的理想--放弃军事机密，通过承认错误来帮助宣传。你给了俘虏你的人他们想要的东西，你的奖励是被进一步隔离两个月，“以考虑你的罪行”。</p><p> According to Stockdale, what was actually contemplated by these men was “his betrayal of himself and everything that he stood for.”</p><p>根据斯托克代尔的说法，这些人实际上考虑的是“他对自己和他所代表的一切的背叛。”</p><p> Once released into the general population, this feeling of shame caused men to recoil from other prisoners, thinking themselves uniquely fragile. However, once they realized that everyone in the camp had gone through - and said - the same things, there was a turning point. They gained strength and together the men were able to make the best of an impossibly terrible situation.</p><p>一旦被释放到普通人群中，这种羞耻感导致人们对其他囚犯退缩，认为自己是独一无二的脆弱。然而，一旦他们意识到营地里的每个人都经历了同样的事情，并说了同样的话，就出现了转折点。他们获得了力量，他们一起能够在一个令人难以置信的可怕情况下取得最好的成绩。</p><p> The keyword for all of us at first was fragility. Each of us, before we were ever in shouting distance of another American, was made to &#34;take the ropes.&#34; That was a real shock to our systems - and as with all shocks, its impact on our inner selves was a lot more impressive and lasting and important than to our limbs and torsos. These were the sessions where we were taken down to submission and made to blurt out distasteful confessions of guilt and American complicity into antique tape recorders, and then to be put in what I call &#34;cold soak,&#34; six or eight weeks of total isolation to &#34;contemplate our crimes.&#34;</p><p>起初，我们所有人的关键词都是脆弱。在我们与另一个美国人隔开喊叫的距离之前，我们每个人都被要求拉绳子。这对我们的系统来说是一个真正的冲击--就像所有的冲击一样，它对我们内心的影响比对我们的四肢和躯干的影响更令人印象深刻、更持久、更重要。在这些会议上，我们被要求屈服，让我们脱口而出令人不快的罪行和美国共谋的供词，放到古董录音机里，然后放入我所说的冷水中，进行六八个星期的完全隔离，思考我们的罪行。</p><p> What we actually contemplated was what even the most self-satisfied American saw as his betrayal of himself and everything he stood for. It was there that I learned what &#34;Stoic harm&#34; meant. A shoulder broken, a bone in my back broken, and a leg broken twice were peanuts by comparison. Epictetus said: &#34;Look not for any greater harm than this: destroying the trustworthy, self-respecting, well-behaved man within you.&#34;</p><p>我们实际上思考的是，即使是最自满的美国人也认为他背叛了自己和他所代表的一切。就是在那里，我明白了斯多葛式的伤害是什么意思。相比之下，肩部骨折、背部一根骨头骨折和一条腿两次骨折都是微不足道的。爱比克泰德说：没有比这更大的伤害了：摧毁你内心值得信赖、自尊、行为端正的人。</p><p> When put into a regular cell block, hardly an American came out of that without responding something like this when first whispered to by a fellow prisoner next door: &#34;You don&#39;t want to talk to me; I am a traitor.&#34; And because we were equally fragile, it seemed to catch on that we all replied something like this: &#34;Listen, pal, there are no virgins in here. You should have heard the kind of statement I made. Snap out of it. We&#39;re all in this together. What&#39;s your name? Tell me about yourself. &#34;To hear that was, for most new prisoners just out of initial shakedown and cold soak, a turning point in their lives.</p><p>当被关进普通牢房时，几乎没有一个美国人在走出牢房时不回应这样的话，隔壁的一名囚犯第一次低声对他说：你不想跟我说话，我是叛徒。而且因为我们同样脆弱，似乎每个人都会这样回答：听着，伙计，这里没有处女。你应该听听我说的那种话。振作起来。我们都在这件事上。你叫什么名字？跟我说说你自己。听到这一消息，对于大多数刚从最初的敲诈和冷泡中走出来的新囚犯来说，这是他们生命中的一个转折点。</p><p>  Stockdale was the senior-most officer in the prison, and as such, he was in command of what was essentially an American military colony on Vietnamese soil. In this position, he was able to multiply what he had learned from Epictetus across the entire American prisoner of war population. He knew that allowing men to be isolated without a sense of purpose would result in them all breaking down - feeling shame that they did not live up to their own definition of themselves was worse than a broken body.</p><p>斯托克代尔是监狱里级别最高的军官，因此，他指挥着这个本质上是越南领土上的美国军事殖民地的地方。在这个职位上，他能够将他从爱比克泰德那里学到的东西扩大到整个美国战俘群体。他知道，让男人没有使命感而与世隔绝，会导致他们全部崩溃--感到羞耻，因为他们没有达到自己对自己的定义，这比一个破碎的身体更糟糕。</p><p> We are in a spot like we&#39;ve never been in before. But we deserve to maintain our self-respect, to have the feeling we are fighting back. We can&#39;t refuse to do every degrading thing they demand of us, but it&#39;s up to you, boss, to pick out things we must all refuse to do, unless and until they put us through the ropes again. We deserve to sleep at night. We at least deserve to have the satisfaction that we are hewing to our leader&#39;s orders. Give us the list: What are we to take torture for?</p><p>我们现在所处的位置是我们以前从未来过的。但是我们应该保持我们的自尊，有一种我们正在反击的感觉。我们不能拒绝做他们要求我们做的每一件有辱人格的事情，但老板，除非他们再次把我们逼入绝境，否则我们都必须拒绝做的事情由您来决定。我们应该在晚上睡觉。我们至少应该感到满意，因为我们听从了领导的命令。给我们清单：我们为什么要遭受酷刑？</p><p> And Stockdale followed his own advice - he took “the ropes” fifteen times, had his shoulder broken, his back broken, and his same leg twice broken.</p><p>斯托克代尔听从了自己的建议--他拉了15次“绳子”，肩膀骨折了，背部骨折了，同一条腿断了两次。</p><p> The only way to survive without feeling debilitating shame - shame that was worse than the torture itself - was to have control over what you did and what you said.</p><p>唯一不会感到羞耻的生存方式-比酷刑本身更糟糕的羞耻-是控制你的所作所为和你所说的话。</p><p> This was a first step in claiming what was rightfully ours. Epictetus said: &#34;The judge will do some things to you which are thought to be terrifying; but how can he stop you from taking the punishment he threatened?&#34;</p><p>这是夺取理所当然属于我们的东西的第一步。爱比克泰德说：法官会对你做一些被认为是可怕的事情，但是他怎么能阻止你接受他威胁的惩罚呢？</p><p> That&#39;s my kind of Stoicism. You have a right to make them hurt you, and they don&#39;t like to do it. The prison commissar told my fellow prisoner Ev Alvarez when he was released: &#34;You Americans were nothing like the French; we could count on them to be reasonable.&#34;</p><p>那是我那种坚忍的态度。你有权让他们伤害你，而他们不喜欢这样做。监狱政委在我的狱友EV Alvarez获释时告诉他：你们美国人一点也不像法国人，我们可以相信他们会讲道理的。</p><p> An individual pursuing that which is meaningful can find a reason to face any adversity</p><p>一个追求有意义的事情的人可以找到面对任何逆境的理由。</p><p> Epictetus turned out to be right. All told, it was only a temporary setback from things that were important to me, and being cast in the role as the sovereign head of an American expatriate colony which was destined to remain autonomous, out of communication with Washington, for years on end, was very important to me. I was determined to &#34;play well the given part.&#34;</p><p>事实证明，爱比克泰德是对的。总而言之，这只是一些对我很重要的事情的暂时挫折，而作为一个注定要保持自治、与华盛顿隔绝多年的美国侨民殖民地的主权首领，对我来说非常重要。我决心演好这个角色。</p><p>  But What For? - Multidisciplinary insights for self development.
