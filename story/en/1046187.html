The Federal Reserve’s tracking of US balance sheets contains  hundreds of thousands of data points and doesn’t even scratch the surface of how the money actually flows to and from different accounts. Doing so would require accurately tracking every single unit of currency, inside and outside of the USA, which we simply lack the transparency to achieve.</p><p> 考虑这些后果需要简化假设。美联储（Fed）对美国资产负债表的追踪包含数十万个数据点，甚至还没有弄清这笔钱实际上是如何流入和流出不同帐户的。这样做将需要准确跟踪美国境内和境外的每个单一货币单位，而我们只是缺乏透明度。</p><p> So instead we’ll focus as much as possible on just the debt. What happens with the money that we create through debt. Specifically:</p><p> 因此，我们将尽可能多地只关注债务。我们通过债务创造的货币会发生什么。特别：</p><p>  We’ll ask these four questions across 6 major types of debt that account for almost all of the debt in the USA. Furthermore, we will talk about total outstanding debt, rather than the amount of new debt per year.</p><p>  我们将针对6种主要债务类型提出这四个问题，这些债务类型几乎占美国的所有债务。此外，我们将讨论未偿债务总额，而不是每年的新债务额。</p><p> This article is going to be very data heavy. I believe this is necessary to tell the complex story of the impact of our debt-based economy. But to keep this grounded in context, I’ll restate the reason why the US is founded in debt that was mentioned in last week’s article.</p><p> 本文将是非常繁重的数据。我认为，这对于讲述基于债务的经济的影响的复杂故事是必要的。但是为了保持这种背景，我将重申上周文章中提到的美国负债累累的原因。</p><p> We have a growing number of people with increasing and changing desires. In order for this growing population to be able to receive a paycheck that grows every year instead of shrinks, we need to increase the amount of money in the world. But simply printing money risks hyper-inflation, where your net worth can, in the span of a month, lose value to a microscopic fraction of a penny of its original value. So debt seemed to solve the problem of creating money without triggering inflation.</p><p> 我们有越来越多的人，他们的愿望与日俱增。为了使不断增长的人口能够获得每年增长而不是减少的薪水，我们需要增加世界上的货币数量。但是，仅仅印制钞票就有可能导致通货膨胀，在一个月的时间里，您的资产净值可能缩水至原始价值的一分钱。因此，债务似乎解决了在不引发通货膨胀的情况下创造货币的问题。</p><p>      Discussing the Federal Government’s debt is a good time to bring up the difference between deficit and debt. Deficit is how much money a government spends every year minus how much it earns. Debt is the sum of that overspending.</p><p>      讨论联邦政府的债务是拉开赤字与债务之差的好时机。赤字是政府每年花费多少钱减去收入。债务是超支之和。 </p><p> Given that, analyzing how the annual budget has been spent effectively describes where the money from the debt has flowed. As the numbers below show, a large amount of that money is concentrated in a small fraction of America. Specifically, between social security, Medicare, Medicaid, and defense spending, 67% of Federal spending goes to 33% of the country ($18T to 107.25M, $168,000 per person). 33% of the money is spread between 67% ($9.1T to 220M, $41,000 per person).</p><p>鉴于此，分析如何有效地使用年度预算可以描述债务资金流向何处。如下图所示，大量资金集中在美国的一小部分。具体而言，在社会保障，医疗保险，医疗补助和国防支出之间，联邦支出的67％用于该国的33％（$ 18T至107.25M，每人$ 168,000）。 33％的资金分散在67％之间（$ 9.1T至2.2亿，每人$ 41,000）。</p><p>  What does the interest look like?  The range is 0-4.5%, depending on when the debt was sold and how long its maturity length is.</p><p>  兴趣是什么样的？范围为0-4.5％，具体取决于出售债务的时间以及到期时间。</p><p> Who receives the money created by debt? Because federal money goes to children as well as adults, we’ll be calculating the percentage of the total number of Americans instead of just adults.</p><p> 谁收到债务产生的钱？由于联邦政府的资金既用于儿童，也用于成人，因此我们将计算美国人总数（而不是成年人）中所占的百分比。</p><p> 22.7% spent on social security, minimum age for receipt is 62 ( 46M, 14% of all Americans)</p><p> 在社会保障上花费了22.7％，最低领取年龄是62岁（4600万，占所有美国人的14％）</p><p> 14.5% spent on Medicare, minimum age for receipt is 65 ( 41M, 12.4% of all Americans)</p><p> 在Medicare上花费了14.5％，最低接收年龄为65岁（4100万，占所有美国人的12.4％）</p><p>  15.3% is spent on defense. For some rough estimates,  the Department of Defense has 1.3M members and if you combine the employees of the top ten defense contractors  you get roughly another million. So we could make a rough estimate of 2.3-3 million .09%</p><p>  15.3％的钱用于防御。粗略估计，美国国防部拥有130万成员，如果将前十名国防承包商的雇员加在一起，您将获得大约一百万。因此，我们可以粗略估算出2.3-3百万.09％</p><p>  Remaining 29.5% broadly spread beyond that ( top 3 are health/human services, education, and veterans affairs)</p><p>  剩余的29.5％的收入分布广泛（排名前三的是健康/公共服务，教育和退伍军人事务） </p><p>    Municipal Debt can be thought of in similar terms to Federal Debt. Instead of debt taken on by the federal government, municipal debt is taken on by states, cities, and counties. However, municipal debt is not nearly as transparently tracked as federal debt, so we will have to make more assumptions.</p><p>市政债务的含义可以与联邦债务类似。市政债务由州，市和县承担，而不是由联邦政府承担。但是，市政债务的追踪不如联邦债务透明，因此我们将不得不做出更多假设。</p><p> Municipal debt funds services like public schools, maintenance of public property, and public transportation. Unlike almost every other form of debt, any money paid as interest by municipal bonds is untaxed. That may go toward explaining why households and nonprofits own and receive interest from 46% of all municipal debt, more than any other type of debt.</p><p> 市政债务资金服务包括公立学校，公共财产维护和公共交通等。与几乎所有其他形式的债务不同，市政债券作为利息支付的任何货币均免税。这也许可以解释为什么家庭和非营利组织拥有并从所有市政债务中获得46％的利息，这比任何其他类型的债务都多。</p><p> Around  16 million Americans are directly employed by State and Local governments, so if we were to assume the debt money flowed to them, then we have $3.8T to 16M, $237,500 per person.</p><p> 大约有1600万美国人直接受州和地方政府雇用，因此，如果我们假设债务资金流向他们，那么我们有3.8T到1600万，每人237,500美元。</p><p>  What does the interest look like? We can only estimate, because this market isn’t the most transparent</p><p>  兴趣是什么样的？我们只能估算，因为这个市场不是最透明的</p><p> Who receives the money created by debt? As an example, we’ll use  California’s state budget.</p><p> 谁收到债务产生的钱？举例来说，我们将使用加利福尼亚州的预算。</p><p>    The Financial Industry’s debt is the least transparent of all. We can make almost no assumptions. In fact, after the Financial Crisis, the Federal Reserve heavily criticized banks for  not publicly accounting for a massive amount of debt. Constraints have been placed on banks since then, but we still lack full transparency.</p><p>    金融业的债务是最不透明的。我们几乎无法做任何假设。实际上，在金融危机之后，美联储（Fed）严厉批评银行未公开核算巨额债务。自那时以来，银行一直受到限制，但我们仍然缺乏充分的透明度。</p><p> We do know the amount of people who work in finance. Roughly  6.3M (1.9% of adults) work in finance, while companies owned by financial firms (specifically called Private Equity firms) employ 11.3 million (3.4%).</p><p> 我们确实知道从事金融工作的人数。大约有630万（占成年人的1.9％）从事金融工作，而金融公司拥有的公司（又称为私募股权公司）则雇用1,130万（占3.4％）。 </p><p> We also know rough estimates on the amount of Financial Debt from the Federal Reserve’s  accounting in 2017, which is how we come to $50T. But beyond that, it’s difficult to make even the roughest of estimates.</p><p>我们还知道美联储2017年会计中的金融债务总额（这就是我们得出的50T金额）的粗略估算。但是除此之外，很难做出最粗略的估计。</p><p>  Who receives the money created by debt? We can only assume financial institutions (in and out of America)</p><p>  谁收到债务产生的钱？我们只能假设金融机构（在美国境内和境外）</p><p> Who owns the debt? We can only assume financial institutions (in and out of America)</p><p> 谁拥有债务？我们只能假设金融机构（在美国境内和境外）</p><p>       Corporate debt is at the same time transparent and opaque. It’s extremely transparent in how much there is and the general interest rates. Corporate debt is graded from AAA “high quality” debt, to CCC or below “low quality” debt. In general the higher the quality, the more likely the debt is to be paid back, the lower the interest rate.</p><p>       公司债务同时是透明和不透明的。存入的金额和一般利率极为透明。公司债务从AAA“高质量”债务分级为CCC或低于“低质量”债务。通常，质量越高，偿还债务的可能性就越大，利率就越低。</p><p> Where corporate debt becomes opaque is in regards to how it’s spent. For many public companies the only accounting visible to the public is the balance sheet, which only really gives X dollars were spent and Y dollars were made. A breakdown of X and Y, how money was specifically spent or specifically made, does not generally exist. So in regards to how money is spent, we will have to make very aggressive assumptions.</p><p> 公司债务变得不透明的地方在于如何使用。对于许多上市公司而言，公众可见的唯一会计是资产负债表，实际上只给出了X美元的支出和Y美元的支出。通常不存在X和Y的细分，即货币的特定使用或特定赚钱方式。因此，关于如何花钱，我们将不得不做出非常激进的假设。</p><p> Assumptions like Amazon’s business is representative of all US corporations. Assumptions like the way all money spent by corporations is how debt is specifically spent. These assumptions are flawed, but we need assumptions like this to get a general ballpark estimate.</p><p> 诸如亚马逊业务之类的假设代表了所有美国公司。假设像公司花所有钱的方式就是专门用于债务的方式。这些假设是有缺陷的，但是我们需要像这样的假设才能获得一般的估算。</p><p> Using these assumptions, we approximate that 29% of spending is on employees (as justified below), 69.5% is on other businesses, domestic and foreign. Effectively, $2.1T of corporate debt is spent on employees totaling $8,200 per adult.</p><p> 使用这些假设，我们估计有29％的支出用于员工（如下文所述），69.5％的支出用于其他国内外业务。实际上，$ 2.1T的公司债务在雇员身上的花费总计为每位成人$ 8,200。 </p><p>  Who is responsible for paying back the debt? Corporations (think more office buildings less local bar)</p><p>谁负责偿还债务？公司（想想更多的办公楼，减少当地的酒吧）</p><p> Who receives the money created by debt? There is no easy way to say how debt is spent at one company, let alone every company. As a grossly simplified example, we will use the way  Amazon spends money.</p><p> 谁收到债务产生的钱？没有简单的方法来说明如何在一家公司花费债务，更不用说每家公司了。作为一个大大简化的示例，我们将使用亚马逊的花钱方式。</p><p> To estimate the amount spent on employees: Amazon has  1,000,000 US employees, 350,000 warehouse employees are paid $35,000 a year, and  we might roughly assume the rest to average $100,000. With this rough assumption we see $77.3B (29%) spent on labor, with the remainder paid to other companies.</p><p> 要估计在员工身上花费的金额：亚马逊有1,000,000名美国员工，350,000名仓库员工的年薪为35,000美元，我们可以大致假设其余的平均水平为100,000美元。有了这个粗略的假设，我们看到$ 77.3B（29％）的劳动力支出，其余的支付给其他公司。</p><p>    Non-corporate debt is very similar to corporate debt. It’s debt taken out for businesses that don&#39;t have clear public documentation of spending. But because these loans aren’t publicly traded, we only have transparency on interest rates for  SBA loans. Furthermore, non-corporate businesses are typically smaller mom and pop businesses whose debts come through SBA loans.</p><p>    非企业债务与公司债务非常相似。对于没有明确公开支出记录的企业，这是一笔债务。但是，由于这些贷款未公开交易，因此我们仅对SBA贷款的利率具有透明度。此外，非公司业务通常是规模较小的妈妈和流行业务，其债务通过SBA贷款来承担。</p><p> If we make roughly the same assumption as with corporate debt, then effectively $798B of non-corporate business debt is spent on employees totaling $3,100 per adult.</p><p> 如果我们做出与公司债务大致相同的假设，则实际上$ 798B的非公司业务债务将花费在雇员身上，每位成人总计$ 3,100。</p><p>  Who is responsible for paying back the debt? Typically, you would assume small businesses. However, it’s worth noting that most of  Koch Industries’ companies are non-corporate businesses and they pull in  $115B in yearly revenue.</p><p>  谁负责偿还债务？通常，您会假设小型企业。但是，值得注意的是，大多数Koch Industries的公司都是非公司业务，他们的年收入为$ 115B。</p><p> What does the interest look like?  5.5-8% if SBA loans. Otherwise expect something similar to corporate business debt.</p><p> 兴趣是什么样的？如果SBA贷款，则为5.5-8％。否则，可能会遇到类似于公司业务债务的情况。 </p><p> Who receives the money created by debt? If we make similar assumptions as before, again because lack of transparency, 29% employees, 1.5% taxes and interest, 69.5% to other businesses</p><p>谁收到债务产生的钱？如果我们做出与以前类似的假设，那么又会因为缺乏透明度而导致29％的员工，1.5％的税金和利息，69.5％的其他业务</p><p> Who owns the debt? It’s hard to say because of the lack of transparency, but at least for SBA loans, expect banks and credit unions.</p><p> 谁拥有债务？由于缺乏透明度，很难说，但至少对于SBA贷款而言，期望银行和信用合作社如此。</p><p>        We end with consumer debt because it is the debt most people are familiar with. You are a consumer so, if you’ve ever borrowed money, you held consumer debt. Consumer debt is different from the other 5 categories because of how neatly it can be broken further into sub-categories. It also has some of the most available information, so the estimates will be most accurate here.</p><p>        我们以消费者债务结束，因为这是大多数人都熟悉的债务。您是消费者，因此，如果您曾经借钱，就持有消费者债务。消费者债务与其他5个类别不同，因为它可以更细分地细分为多个子类别。它还具有一些最可用的信息，因此此处的估算值最准确。</p><p> If we assume the average interest rate for every type of debt, then the average American is $55,000 in debt with 9.3% APR.</p><p> 如果我们假设每种债务的平均利率，那么美国人的平均债务为55,000美元，实际年利率为9.3％。</p><p> But averages can be deceiving. If one person makes $0 and another person makes $100, the average is $50, but only focusing on that average completely misses the disparity in money made.</p><p> 但是平均值可能是骗人的。如果一个人赚$ 0，另一个人赚$ 100，则平均值为$ 50，但只关注该平均值会完全错过赚钱的差距。</p><p> To dig beyond the average, it’s worth noting that, despite mortgages taking up 73% of total consumer debt, only 63% of adults own their homes. And with property debt, unlike the other forms of consumer debt, you largely pay yourself, with only the interest being paid to others. In effect, only 5% of $10.8T is paid to others, or $3,400 per homeowner per year.</p><p> 要超越平均水平，值得注意的是，尽管抵押贷款占消费者债务总额的73％，但只有63％的成年人拥有房屋。与财产债务不同，与其他形式的消费者债务不同，您主要是自己偿还债务，而利息只是支付给他人。实际上，$ 10.8T中只有5％支付给了其他人，或每个房主每年$ 3,400。</p><p> On the other side of the coin, people who haven’t purchased homes  typically have worse credit scores, which means they pay more in interest on the rest of their debt. If we make the rough assumption that the non-property consumer debt is evenly split between all adults, then the average non-property owner is $34,000 in debt at 17.3 % APR. And all of this money, the $5,900 yearly interest payments and the $34,000 in principal, is all owed to other people.</p><p> 另一方面，未购房者的信用评分通常较差，这意味着他们需要为剩余债务支付更多利息。如果我们粗略地假设非财产消费者债务在所有成年人之间平均分配，那么非财产所有者的平均债务为34,000美元，年利率为17.3％。所有这些钱，每年5,900美元的利息和34,000美元的本金，都是欠其他人的。 </p><p>   A mortgage, as most people know, is debt taken on to purchase a house. Home Equity Lines of Credit are loans you can take out once you have already purchased the house, that typically have lower interest rates than other types of loans since they are backed by property.</p><p>众所周知，抵押贷款是购房所承担的债务。房屋净值信贷额度是您在购买房屋后就可以提取的贷款，这些贷款的利率通常低于其他类型的贷款，因为这些贷款是由房地产支持的。</p><p>  Who is responsible for paying back the debt?  63% of  American adults. It’s worth noting though,  that home ownership for those aged 35 and under is 36.4%, while 70% of those 45 and over own homes.</p><p>  谁负责偿还债务？ 63％的美国成年人。不过，值得注意的是，年龄在35岁及以下的人的房屋拥有率为36.4％，而在45岁及以上的人中，有70％拥有房屋。</p><p> What does the interest look like? If you have good credit, you can expect interest rates of 3-7%  depending on credit score and year. If your credit score is 640 or less, the interest rate will almost certainly be variable (changes year to year) and can span from 8-20%. When I mentioned in last week’s article how interest rates multiplied overnight during the housing crisis, I was describing these variable interest rate mortgages offered to those with low credit scores.</p><p> 兴趣是什么样的？如果您拥有良好的信誉，则可以根据信用评分和年份来预期获得3-7％的利率。如果您的信用评分为640或更低，那么利率几乎可以肯定是可变的（逐年变化），范围可以是8-20％。当我在上周的文章中提到住房危机期间利率如何在一夜之间成倍增长时，我描述的是为低信用评分的人提供的这些可变利率抵押贷款。</p><p> Who receives the money created by debt? The former homeowner receives the money created by the debt, but you pay yourself as you work to pay off the principal of the debt. Every dollar you pay to the principal is a dollar you get back if you were to sell your house.</p><p> 谁收到债务产生的钱？前房主会收到债务产生的钱，但是您在偿还债务本金时会自己偿还。您付给本金的每一美元就是您要出售房屋时所获得的一美元。</p><p> Who owns the debt? This info is not transparent as anyone who saw  The Big Short can attest; however, we do have some insights and can make assumptions from there. The Federal Reserve  holds $2T or 18.5% of mortgage-related debt. This means that the US Financial Industry holds at most $8.8T or 81.5% of mortgage-related debt, though some may be owned by foreign investors.</p><p> 谁拥有债务？正如看到“大短裤”的任何人所能证明的那样，此信息不是透明的。但是，我们确实有一些见识，可以据此做出假设。美联储持有2T或抵押相关债务的18.5％。这意味着美国金融业最多持有$ 8.8T或抵押贷款相关债务的81.5％，尽管其中一些可能由外国投资者拥有。</p><p>   The Federal Reserve’s notes on “other” were not specified in the documents I found, so we will focus on a snapshot of an example and make some extrapolating assumptions. As a specific example, we will focus on payday loans.</p><p>   我发现的文件中未指定美联储关于“其他”的注释，因此我们将重点关注示例的快照并做出一些推断性假设。作为一个具体示例，我们将重点关注发薪日贷款。</p><p>  Who is responsible for paying back the debt?  At a minimum  12M (6.4% of adults)</p><p>  谁负责偿还债务？至少1200万（成年人的6.4％） </p><p>  Who receives the money created by debt? Businesses receive the upfront cash, payday loan companies receive the principal repayments.</p><p>谁收到债务产生的钱？企业收到前期现金，发薪日贷款公司收到本金还款。</p><p>   Credit cards have interest rates that are higher than almost every other form of debt, consumer or not. In large part that’s because they, like payday loans, typically are backed by nothing. A mortgage is backed by a house, an auto loan is backed by a car, but credit cards are backed by nothing.</p><p>   信用卡的利率几乎高于其他任何形式的债务，无论消费者与否。在很大程度上，这是因为它们（如发薪日贷款）通常没有任何担保。抵押贷款由房屋支持，汽车贷款由汽车支持，但信用卡则无。</p><p>  What does the interest look like?  The average is 12-19%, highs can get over 25%.</p><p>  兴趣是什么样的？平均为12-19％，最高可超过25％。</p><p>  $90B or 11% in credit card debt is retail cards, so the debt is held by retail businesses (think Macy’s or Express)</p><p>  $ 90B或信用卡债务中的11％是零售卡，因此债务由零售企业持有（例如梅西百货或Express）</p><p>   Auto loans are similar to home loans in that you are buying something with resale value, a car. However, unlike most homes, cars lose significant value over time. If you buy new,  cars lose 60% of their value in 5 years. As you might expect, this leads auto loan interest rates to be higher than mortgages.</p><p>   汽车贷款类似于住房贷款，因为您购买的是具有转售价值的东西，即汽车。但是，与大多数房屋不同，汽车会随着时间的流逝而失去重大价值。如果您购买新车，汽车将在5年内损失其价值的60％。如您所料，这导致汽车贷款利率高于抵押贷款利率。</p><p>  What does the interest look like?  3-10% depending on credit score and year. For reference, if your credit score is over 720, expect 3.6% APR. If your credit score is less than 689 ( in 2020, the average credit score for those under 39 years old is 680), then expect 7.02% APR.</p><p>  兴趣是什么样的？ 3-10％，取决于信用评分和年份。作为参考，如果您的信用评分超过720，则预期为3.6％的年利率。如果您的信用分数低于689（2020年，39岁以下人群的平均信用分数为680），则预期年利率为7.02％。</p><p> Who receives the money created by debt?  Car companies, who employ 1.7M people, receive the upfront payment, but when you pay back the principal you receive a small amount of your original money in auto resale value.</p><p> 谁收到债务产生的钱？雇用170万员工的汽车公司会收到预付款，但是当您还本金时，您会收到少量的汽车转售原始资金。 </p><p>   The argument for student loans is that they are supposed to be investments in your future. That you earn more after college. And it’s true that  the median salary of a person with a bachelor degree is $44,000, while the median earning of somebody with a high school diploma is $30,000. But when you take into account that people with high school diplomas work during the four years university students are in college, as well as take into account student debt, then you realize that it takes 8 years out of college for a person with a bachelor’s degree to out earn the money earned with a high school diploma.</p><p>学生贷款的理由是，它们应该是您未来的投资。大学毕业后你会赚更多。的确，拥有学士学位的人的平均工资为$ 44,000，而拥有高中文凭的人的平均工资为$ 30,000。但是，如果您考虑到拥有大专文凭的人在大学生上大学的四年期间都工作过，并且考虑到学生的债务，那么您就会意识到，拥有学士学位的人要花上大学八年的时间赚取高中文凭所赚的钱。</p><p> Moreover student loans are intended to be paid off in 10 years.  In reality, the average time until debt payoff is 21 years.</p><p> 此外，学生贷款计划在10年内还清。实际上，偿还债务的平均时间为21年。</p><p>  What does the interest look like? If the loan is Federal,  2.75% -7% depending on year, amount, and whether the student is undergrad or grad. Also, federal student loans are capped at $23K  subsidized (cheaper), $57.5K total. If the loan is private,  4-12% depending on credit score and whether or not a cosigner is used. The difference between with/without a cosigner can be up to 4% points.</p><p>  兴趣是什么样的？如果贷款是联邦贷款，则取决于年份，金额以及学生是本科生还是研究生，为2.75％-7％。另外，联邦学生贷款的最高补贴额为$ 23K（更便宜），总计$ 5.75万。如果贷款是私人贷款，则4-12％取决于信用评分以及是否使用共同签名人。有/没有共同签名者之间的差异可以达到4％。</p><p> Who receives the money created by debt? The money is paid to universities but there isn’t a lot of transparency on how universities spend their money. A fraction goes to the  3.6M University employees. Some money is spent on construction/repairs ( the total amount of construction employees is 11.2M). Some money goes to student aid (again 45M students). The rest goes into endowments. Worth noting, over a 24-year period (1986-2008),  endowment size grew by nearly 800% while university costs grew by only 300%.</p><p> 谁收到债务产生的钱？这笔钱是支付给大学的，但是大学如何花钱并没有很多透明度。 360万大学员工中很少。一些钱用于建筑/维修（建筑工人总数为1,120万）。一些钱用于助学金（再次有4500万学生）。其余的用于捐赠。值得一提的是，在24年期间（1986-2008年），捐赠规模增长了近800％，而大学成本仅增长了300％。</p><p>   Debt is a solution to an economic problem. Debt forms the basis of a system wherein we can print money as needed, but the interest rates mean the money is created ideally only as needed. This system requires new debt to be taken out by future generations to pay existing debt, but if not enough new debt can be taken out or too much new debt is required in too short of a time, then we risk significant defaulting on payments. And with all of the accounting we’ve just done, we now have the numbers to roughly verify how well this system is working out.</p><p>   债务是解决经济问题的方法。债务构成系统的基础，在该系统中，我们可以根据需要打印货币，但利率意味着理想情况下仅根据需要创建货币。该系统要求子孙后代承担新债务以偿还现有债务，但是如果无法提取足够的新债务，或者在很短的时间内需要太多新债务，那么我们就有可能出现严重的拖欠款项。在完成所有会计处理后，我们现在有了一些数字可以大致验证该系统的运行情况。</p><p> If we were to assume that all Federal and Municipal debt is spent on consumers, then the max amount of money given to consumers through debt is $41.5T. Meanwhile, consumers pay $1.8T in interest a year. With these numbers, it would take 34.7 years for the consumer debt interest to eat through all of the money given to consumers that was created by debt.</p><p> 如果我们假设所有联邦和市政债务都花在了消费者身上，那么通过债务提供给消费者的最大金额为$ 41.5T。同时，消费者每年支付$ 1.8T的利息。有了这些数字，消费者债务利息要花掉34.7年，才能将债务产生的所有给予消费者的钱吞噬掉。</p><p> At first glance, this might make it look like our debt-based system is working perfectly.</p><p> 乍一看，这可能会使我们的基于债务的系统运行正常。 </p><p> But if you’re not part of the 33% of the population that’s over 62, paid through defense spending, or on Medicaid, the total money given to the remaining consumers drops to $26.9T and 34.7 years drops to 20.7 years. If you also aren’t one of the 63% of adults who are homeowners, that total drops to $16.8T and 20.7 years drops to 12.9 years.</p><p>但是，如果您不属于62岁以上，通过国防支出或通过医疗补助支付的33％的人口，则分配给其余消费者的总金额将降至$ 26.9T，而34.7年的收入将降至20.7年。如果您也不是63％的房主成人之一，则总费用将降至$ 16.8T，而20.7年将降至12.9年。</p><p> If we were to take an admittedly extreme example and imagine this system without any government assistance, then those without homes would only be receiving the $2.9T from businesses. With this, in 1.6 years all of the money these consumers received that was created by debt would be eaten by consumer debt interest.</p><p> 如果我们举一个公认的极端例子，并想象这个系统在没有任何政府援助的情况下，那么那些没有房屋的人将只能从企业那里获得$ 2.9T。这样，在1.6年内，这些消费者从债务中获得的所有钱将被消费者的债务利息吞噬。</p><p> Meanwhile businesses pay $580B in interest a year, and have received a total of $11.46T in money created through debt. With this total, it would take 19.8 years for the business debt interest to eat through all of the money given to businesses that was created by debt.</p><p> 同时，企业每年支付$ 580B的利息，并且通过债务产生的总金额为$ 11.46T。有了这个总数，将需要19.8年的时间才能使企业债务利息吞噬所有由债务创造的资金。</p><p> This is rationally justified. Interest rates are typically indicative of risk. When a bank loans somebody money, there is always the risk that the person or business defaults and the bank loses all of the loaned money. Interest rates are supposed to balance out the risk. The less likely a debt is to be repaid, the higher the interest rate.</p><p> 这是有道理的。利率通常表示风险。当银行向某人借钱时，总是存在个人或企业违约的风险，银行会损失所有借出的钱。利率应该可以抵消风险。偿还债务的可能性越小，利率越高。</p><p> Businesses typically utilize debt to grow their business and make more money, so these loans can be seen as less risky and justify a lower interest rate. Consumers, when not purchasing homes, typically utilize debt in ways that spend money on goods/services rather than investments, so this debt is seen as more risky and justified a higher interest rate.</p><p> 企业通常利用债务来发展业务并赚取更多的钱，因此这些贷款被视为风险较小，并证明较低的利率是合理的。消费者在不购买房屋时，通常以将钱花在商品/服务而不是投资上的方式来利用债务，因此，这种债务被认为更具风险性，并有理由证明具有较高的利率。</p><p> This is rational. And this is crippling. We’ve become reliant on government debt to prevent consumers from bleeding out and that still leaves gaps where over 30% of Americans can slip through the cracks.</p><p> 这是合理的。这真是残酷。我们已经依靠政府债务来防止消费者流血，这仍然存在差距，超过30％的美国人可以从裂缝中溜走。</p><p> In such a situation, what is a consumer supposed to do? What is a human supposed to do?</p><p> 在这种情况下，消费者应该怎么做？人类应该做什么？ </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://jordanugalde.substack.com/p/debt-creates-money-where-does-it-663">https://jordanugalde.substack.com/p/debt-creates-money-where-does-it-663</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/债务/">#债务</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/created/">#created</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
