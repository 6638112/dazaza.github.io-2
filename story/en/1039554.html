She tested positive this fall, and three days later, staff members pushed her bed up against a window at the nursing home so her daughter could say goodbye.</p><p> 但是，大福克斯病毒的激增首先归因于学生之间的病例，然后在社区中迅速膨胀，最终传到了包科尔女士。她今年秋天测试阳性，三天后，工作人员将她的床推到养老院的窗户上，以便女儿可以说再见。</p><p> As coronavirus deaths soar across the country, deaths in communities that are home to colleges have risen faster than the rest of the nation, a New York Times analysis of 203 counties where students compose at least 10 percent of the population has found.</p><p> 《纽约时报》对203个县的分析表明，随着全国各地冠状病毒的死亡人数激增，大学所在地社区的死亡人数上升速度超过了全国其他地区，那里学生构成了至少10％的人口。</p><p> In late August and early September, as college students returned to campus and some institutions put into place rigorous testing programs, the number of reported infections surged. Yet because serious illness and death are rare among young coronavirus patients, it was unclear at the time whether the growth of infections on campus would translate into a major health crisis.</p><p> 在8月下旬和9月初，随着大学生返回校园和一些机构制定了严格的测试计划，报告的感染数量激增。然而，由于在年轻的冠状病毒患者中很少发生严重的疾病和死亡，因此当时尚不清楚校园内感染的增长是否会转化为重大的健康危机。</p><p> But since the end of August, deaths from the coronavirus have doubled in counties with a large college population, compared with a 58 percent increase in the rest of the nation. Few of the victims were college students, but rather older people and others living and working in the community.</p><p> 但是自8月底以来，在大学人口众多的县中，冠状病毒的死亡人数增加了一倍，而全国其他地区的死亡率则增加了58％。受害人很少是大学生，而是老年人和在社区生活和工作的其他人。</p><p> Health officials and family members of some people who died in such counties described large surges of cases involving students followed by subsequent infections and deaths in the wider community.</p><p> 在这些县死亡的一些人的卫生官员和家庭成员描述了大批学生感染病例，随后在更广泛的社区中感染和死亡。 </p><p> “When the rate of transmission in the surrounding community is high and increasing,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, “you are going to see more deaths.”</p><p>约翰·霍普金斯大学彭博公共卫生学院的流行病学家詹妮弗·纳佐（Jennifer Nuzzo）说：“当周围社区的传播率很高并且还在增加时，您将看到更多的死亡。”</p><p> Since the pandemic began, a  Times survey has identified more than 397,000 infections at more than 1,800 colleges and universities. Those cases include more than 90 deaths involving college employees and students.</p><p> 自大流行开始以来，《泰晤士报》的一项调查已经确定了1,800多所大学和大学的39.7万例感染。这些案件包括90多名大学雇员和学生死亡。</p><p> The link between an outbreak at a college and a coronavirus death in the wider community is often indirect and difficult to document, according to public health experts, especially without extensive contact tracing, which many local health departments in the United States lack resources to pursue. Deaths have soared in recent weeks, making it difficult to distinguish between outbreaks tied to campuses and health emergencies linked to other causes.</p><p> 根据公共卫生专家的说法，大学爆发与广泛社区中冠状病毒死亡之间的联系通常是间接的，难以记录，尤其是在没有广泛联系追踪的情况下，美国许多地方卫生部门缺乏可追踪的资源。近几周来，死亡人数飙升，很难区分与校园相关的暴发和与其他原因相关的突发卫生事件。</p><p> Yet in September and October, when deaths were well below earlier peaks and fairly steady, they were already rising in many college communities. That trend highlighted a central fear of health officials — that young adults with limited symptoms may unwittingly transmit the virus, increasing the possibility it would ultimately spread to someone more vulnerable.</p><p> 然而在9月和10月，当死亡人数远低于先前的高峰并相当稳定时，许多大学社区的死亡人数已经在上升。这种趋势凸显出人们对卫生官员的恐惧-症状有限的年轻人可能会不知不觉地传播该病毒，从而增加了其最终传播给更脆弱人群的可能性。</p><p> Experts suggest an array of ways such spread might happen, including one simple possibility: More than 1.1 million undergraduates work in health-related occupations, census data shows, including more than 700,000 that serve as nurses, medical assistants and health care aides in their communities.</p><p> 专家建议可能通过多种方式传播，包括一个简单的可能性：人口普查数据显示，超过110万名大学生从事与健康相关的职业，其中包括超过70万名其所在社区的护士，医疗助手和医疗助手。</p><p>  “All it really takes is one cavalier interaction,” said Tali Elfassy, an epidemiologist at the University of Miami.</p><p>  迈阿密大学的流行病学家塔利·埃尔法西（Tali Elfassy）说：“真正需要的只是一种互动。”</p><p> In counties with large college populations and where deaths had increased notably in the fall, local health officials offered a wide range of explanations. Some were emphatic that there was a link between college-related cases and deaths in the wider community. Others said they did not have the resources to contact trace and attributed the rise in deaths to a broader community spread, or said the spread appeared linked to other factors, too — an uptick in tourism, youth sports or indoor gatherings.</p><p> 在大学人口众多且死亡人数在秋季显着增加的县，当地卫生官员提供了各种各样的解释。一些人强调与大学有关的案件和更广泛的社区中的死亡之间存在联系。其他人则说他们没有资源来联系踪迹，并将死亡人数的增加归因于更广泛的社区传播，或者说这种传播似乎也与其他因素有关-旅游业，青年体育或室内聚会的增加。 </p><p> But researchers have begun finding evidence of ties to college students. Using genetic sequencing to track Covid-19 cases around the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, Paraic Kenny, a cancer geneticist at the Kabara Cancer Research Institute of the Gundersen Medical Foundation, has found links between infections at the university and cases and deaths in the surrounding region.</p><p>但是研究人员已经开始找到与大学生有联系的证据。甘德森医学基金会卡巴拉癌症研究所的癌症遗传学家Paraic Kenny使用遗传测序追踪威斯康星州拉克罗斯大学附近的Covid-19病例，发现甘德森大学感染与病例和死亡之间存在关联。周边地区。</p><p> Dr. Kenny, who wrote about his findings in a study that has yet to be peer-reviewed, said he has identified at least 18 deaths in long-term care facilities and in the La Crosse community that occurred after a virus outbreak at the college in September and had the same genetic fingerprint as two strains that drove the college student outbreak.</p><p> 肯尼博士在一项尚待同行评审的研究中写下了他的发现，他说，他已经确定在该大学爆发病毒后，长期护理机构和拉克罗斯社区至少有18人死亡。在9月份，它与导致大学生爆发的两种菌株具有相同的基因指纹。</p><p> “The genetics really allows you to join the dots between all of these seemingly unconnected situations,” said Dr. Kenny, who is also an adjunct associate professor at the university in La Crosse.</p><p> 肯尼博士说：“遗传学确实使您可以将所有这些看似无关的情况混为一谈，”肯尼博士也是拉克罗斯大学的副教授。</p><p> Even without genetic evidence, Linda Vail, health officer for Ingham County, Mich., said it was likely that some deaths in her area could be attributed to a surge of cases in September involving hundreds of Michigan State University students and employees.</p><p> 即使没有遗传学证据，密歇根州英厄姆县卫生官员Linda Vail表示，她所在地区的一些死亡很可能归因于9月涉及数百名密歇根州立大学学生和员工的病例激增。</p><p>  Students make up more than 18 percent of the population in Ingham County, home to Michigan State. Classes were suddenly moved online for most undergraduates in August, but tens of thousands of students returned to the area, many renting off-campus housing.</p><p>  在密歇根州的故乡英厄姆县，学生占人口的18％以上。 8月，大多数本科生的课程突然转移到了网上，但是成千上万的学生回到了该地区，许多学生租用了校外住房。</p><p> Some colleges and health officials have said that viral transmission in classrooms and during official campus events has been limited, but have pointed to activities and gatherings outside of classes as a root of spread.</p><p> 一些大学和卫生官员表示，教室和官方校园活动期间的病毒传播受到限制，但他们指出课外活动和聚会是传播的根源。</p><p>  “The students came back anyway, and swooped down on bars and restaurants and other places and caused outbreaks in the community,” said Debra Furr-Holden, a Michigan State epidemiologist and associate dean for public health integration. The university quickly pivoted, she said, trying to reach students and offering testing, but found it was difficult to convince them to follow rules.</p><p>  密歇根州流行病学专家，公共卫生整合副院长Debra Furr-Holden说：“学生们无论如何都回来了，在酒吧，饭店和其他地方俯冲而下，引起了社区的爆发。”她说，大学迅速采取行动，试图吸引学生并提供考试，但发现很难说服他们遵守规则。 </p><p> “We had an unintended negative consequence that these students were then not within our safety and protection and under our purview where we could better dictate testing, isolation, quarantine and all of that,” she said.</p><p>她说：“我们有意想不到的消极后果，那就是这些学生当时不在我们的安全和保护之内，而且在我们的职权范围内，我们可以更好地规定测试，隔离，隔离以及所有这些。”</p><p> The county went from having about 300 new infections in August to about 1,800 in September. On Sept. 14, health officials said a majority of the newest cases involved students at Michigan State and ordered people in many fraternities and sororities to quarantine. Virus deaths have more than tripled in the county since the end of August, to 141 from 41.</p><p> 该县从8月的约300例新感染增加到9月的约1800例。 9月14日，卫生官员说，大多数最新病例涉及密歇根州立大学的学生，并下令许多同胞和姐妹会隔离。自8月底以来，该县的病毒死亡人数增加了两倍多，从41例增加到141例。</p><p> In mid-October, Dennis Neuner was driving home from a hospital in Lansing, having just dropped off his wife, Sharon, who was admitted. They had both tested positive for the coronavirus and she developed a nasty cough.</p><p> 10月中旬，丹尼斯·诺伊纳（Dennis Neuner）从兰辛的一家医院开车回家，他的妻子莎伦（Sharon）刚被送下车。他们俩的冠状病毒检测都呈阳性，而且她咳嗽得很厉害。</p><p> Mr. Neuner took a shortcut on M.A.C. Avenue, home to some of Michigan State’s sororities. He said he saw some 200 students dotting the lawns, celebrating a football game. Some had red Solo cups, some were playing beer pong and cornhole.</p><p> 诺伊纳先生在M.A.C.密西根州州联谊会的所在地大道。他说，他看到大约200名学生在草坪上欢呼雀跃，庆祝足球比赛。一些人拿着红色的独奏杯，一些人打啤酒乒乓球和玉米corn。</p><p>  Mr. Neuner made arrangements for a friend to watch his Jack Russell terrier, Daisy, then drove back to the hospital, where he was also admitted for respiratory distress.</p><p>  诺伊纳先生安排一个朋友看他的杰克罗素梗犬黛西，然后开车返回医院，在那里他也因呼吸窘迫而入院。</p><p> By the next day, his symptoms had improved enough for him to recuperate at home. His wife, 71, who had been healthy and active before catching the virus, eventually developed a blood infection and could no longer breathe on her own. She died on Nov. 12.</p><p> 到第二天，他的症状已经改善到足以让他在家休养。他的妻子现年71岁，在感染病毒之前一直健康，活跃，最终感染了血液，无法再独自呼吸。她于11月12日死亡。</p><p> Mr. Neuner does not know how he and his wife got sick. They worried when students returned for classes, he said, since they live in a neighborhood where some students and faculty members live and shop at a grocery store frequented by students.</p><p> 诺伊纳先生不知道他和他的妻子怎么生病。他说，他们担心学生何时返回上课，因为他们住在附近的一些学生和教职工在学生经常光顾的杂货店里生活和购物的地方。 </p><p> In another college town, the University of Nebraska at Kearney has been holding both online and in-person classes this fall. Students make up about 12 percent of the population of Buffalo County, where infections began to surge in mid-August before fall classes started. The county of about 50,000 residents, which had about 330 cases from the start of the pandemic until August, saw cases more than triple by the end of September. Buffalo County, which recorded one virus death before August, now has seen 45 people die.</p><p>在另一个大学城，内布拉斯加大学卡尼分校今年秋天一直在进行在线和面对面的课程。学生约占布法罗县（Buffalo County）人口的12％，布法罗县（Buffalo County）的感染在8月中旬开始激增，秋季课程开始前。该县大约有50,000名居民，从大流行开始到8月，大约有330例病例。到9月底，该县的病例增加了两倍多。布法罗县（Buffalo County）在八月之前记录了一次病毒死亡，现在已经看到45人死亡。</p><p> Jeremy Eschliman, health director for the Two Rivers Public Health Department, which covers Buffalo County, said the department could clearly “connect the dots” between students and deaths in high risk populations, like long-term care facilities.</p><p> 覆盖布法罗县的两条河流公共卫生部卫生主任杰里米·埃斯里曼（Jeremy Eschliman）表示，该部显然可以将学生和高风险人群中的死亡（例如长期护理设施）“连接起来”。</p><p>  Todd Gottula, senior director of communications at the university, disagreed with the health department’s assessment, saying the university had shown leadership on the virus, offering free testing. He said the university had become a target because it was more transparent about its cases than some businesses were.</p><p>  该大学传播高级主管托德·戈图拉（Todd Gottula）不同意卫生部门的评估，称该大学在病毒方面表现出领导作用，并提供免费测试。他说，大学之所以成为目标，是因为它的案例比某些企业更透明。</p><p> “When I look around and walk on my campus every day, I see everybody masked up, doing the right thing,” he said.</p><p> 他说：“当我环顾四周，每天在校园里散步时，我看到每个人都被蒙蔽，做正确的事。”</p><p> Several students and residents said they had regularly seen students, especially off-campus, congregating without masks before Kearney instituted a mask requirement in November. Some students recalled professors repeatedly interrupting classes to remind students to wear masks properly.</p><p> 几名学生和居民表示，他们经常见到学生，尤其是校园外的学生，他们在没有口罩的情况下聚集在一起，直到科尔尼在11月制定口罩要求。一些学生回忆起教授反复打断课堂，提醒学生正确戴口罩。</p><p> About three minutes from campus, the Mount Carmel Home had been relatively unscathed before the fall, even though more than 100,000 residents and employees of long-term care centers have died from Covid-19, a Times survey shows. The facility had some cases in the spring, but no one got seriously ill.</p><p> 《时代》杂志的一项调查显示，距离校园约三分钟，卡梅尔山之家在秋天之前相对没有受到任何伤害，尽管超过10万名长期护理中心的居民和雇员因Covid-19死亡。该工厂在春季有一些病例，但是没有人患重病。</p><p> But at the end of September, cases started to pop up among staff members at Mount Carmel, Emily Birdsley, the administrator there, said, though she did not know the origin. Then residents began falling ill. This time, Ms. Birdsley said, she knew it was different. “We’re not going to make it out of this without losing anyone,” she told the director of operations.</p><p> 但是在9月底，案件开始在卡梅尔山的工作人员中突然出现，那里的管理员埃米莉·伯德斯利说，尽管她不知道出身。然后居民开始生病。伯德斯利女士说，这次，她知道情况有所不同。她对运营总监说：“我们不会在没有失去任何人的情况下实现这一目标。” </p><p> In the end, at least 60 residents and staff members tested positive. At least six residents have died.</p><p>最后，至少有60名居民和工作人员呈阳性。至少有六名居民死亡。</p><p> In North Dakota, college students make up about 17 percent of the 70,000 residents of Grand Forks County, where a surge in cases among young people was followed by outbreaks at a nursing home.</p><p> 在北达科他州，大福克斯县7万名居民中，大学生约占17％，那里年轻人病例激增，随后在疗养院爆发。</p><p> Before students from the University of North Dakota returned for a mix of in-person and online classes in August, the county was averaging about six new cases a day per 100,000 people, officials said. After students returned, new cases rose to an average of 94 cases per 100,000 people, and in November, they grew still more: 253 new cases a day per 100,000. The rate of transmission has since fallen to about 55 new cases a day per 100,000.</p><p> 官员们说，在八月份北达科他大学的学生返回现场和在线教学相结合之前，该县平均每天每10万人中约有6例新病例。学生归国后，新病例平均上升到每10万人中94例，到11月，他们的发病率进一步增加：每天每10万人中有253例新病例。此后，传播速度已降至每天每100,000个新病例约55个。</p><p> The spike was partly explained by mass testing on campus, where university officials required students to wear masks indoors and provided quarantine housing. Slowly, though, health officials say the virus seeped into the community.</p><p> 高峰的部分原因是在校园内进行的大规模测试中，该大学的官员要求学生在室内戴口罩并提供隔离所。不过，卫生官员说这种病毒慢慢渗入了社区。</p><p> “The community as a whole never really recovered to where we were at prior to the outbreak,” said Michael Dulitz, who oversees virus data for the Grand Forks area and said the spike from college students was the primary reason for the broad rise. “There was not any other explanation.”</p><p> 监督大福克斯地区病毒数据的迈克尔·杜利茨说：“整个社区从未真正恢复到疫情爆发前的状态。”他说，大学生人数的激增是疫情大规模蔓延的主要原因。 “没有其他解释。”</p><p> Dr. Joshua Wynne, vice president for health affairs at the University of North Dakota, said cases quieted down after an initial bump that may have been related to the return of students. “Our mitigation strategy actually worked,” he said, adding that the subsequent uptick in cases corresponded to a surge across all of North Dakota.</p><p> 北达科他大学卫生事务副校长约书亚·韦恩（Joshua Wynne）博士说，在最初可能与学生回国有关的颠簸之后，案件平息了。他说：“我们的缓解策略实际上奏效了。”他补充说，此后案件的激增与整个北达科他州的激增相对应。</p><p> At Valley Senior Living, the main nursing home and assisted-living provider in town, college students make up about a quarter of employees. They help residents brush their teeth, serve meals of meatballs and potatoes and become like substitute grandchildren to people whose isolation has intensified during the pandemic.</p><p> 在小镇主要的疗养院和辅助生活提供者Valley Senior Living中，大学生约占员工总数的四分之一。他们帮助居民刷牙，提供肉丸和土豆饭，并成为大流行期间隔离加剧的人们的替代孙子。 </p><p> “Students have been a saving grace to us,” said Garth Rydland, chief executive at Valley Senior Living, which has three locations in Grand Forks and serves more than 500 people.</p><p>Valley Senior Living的首席执行官Garth Rydland说：“学生一直是我们的救赎之恩。”该公司在大福克斯（Grand Forks）设有三个办事处，可为500多人提供服务。</p><p> At the same time, he said, “spikes at a university tend to go through the whole community, and it sets off a new wave of community spread.”</p><p> 同时，他说：“一所大学的派生倾向遍及整个社区，这掀起了社区传播的新潮流。”</p><p> After the uptick at the University of North Dakota in August, cases at Valley Senior Living accelerated. Employees — both college students and others — tested positive during routine testing, and cases spread among patients.</p><p> 在八月份北达科他大学（University of North Dakota）上升之后，Valley Senior Living的案件加速了。员工（包括大学生和其他员工）在常规测试中均呈阳性，病例分布在患者中。</p><p> The lockdown created a jarring contrast for Molly McHugo, a senior at the University of North Dakota, who works as a nursing assistant. Near campus, she saw bars busy with students. At work, she watched as patients ate each meal alone in their room.</p><p> 这次禁闭给北达科他大学的高年级学生莫莉·麦克胡戈（Molly McHugo）带来了强烈的反差，后者是一名护理助理。在校园附近，她看到酒吧里挤满了学生。在工作中，她看着病人在他们的房间里单独吃饭。</p><p> “Everyone talks about their rights, and I’m like, what about the rights of my patients?” said Ms. McHugo, 22, who tested positive for the virus in August. “They got all of their freedoms stripped away and it’s for their safety, but what kind of life is it?”</p><p> “每个人都在谈论他们的权利，我想我的病人的权利如何？” 22岁的McHugo女士说，他在8月份对该病毒进行了阳性检测。 “他们被剥夺了所有自由，这是为了他们的安全，但是这是一种什么样的生活？”</p><p> Valley Senior Living set up a Covid-19 unit that has been in use nearly every day since August.</p><p> Valley Senior Living设立了Covid-19装置，自8月以来几乎每天都在使用。</p><p> Nine patients died during a fall wave, including Ms. Baukol, who had sang alto in the church choir and once played piano with the Grand Forks Symphony before ending up at the nursing home, where her daughter, Jan Wysocki, often visited. She took her for air in the garden and spelled the name of family members with Scrabble to nudge her memory.</p><p> 九名患者在一次跌倒浪潮中死亡，包括包科尔女士。鲍柯尔女士曾在教堂合唱团中高唱，并曾与大福克斯交响乐团合作弹钢琴，后来到了疗养院，她的女儿简·怀索克经常来此探望。她带她在花园里放风，并用Scrabble拼写了家人的名字，以唤起她的记忆。 </p><p> “Covid is there,” Ms. Wysocki said. “And it takes people’s lives.”</p><p>Wysocki女士说：“ Covid在那儿。” “这需要人们的生命。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/international/world-news-politics/young-people-have-less-covid-19-risk-but-in-us-college-towns-deaths-rose-fast-926764.html">https://www.deccanherald.com/international/world-news-politics/young-people-have-less-covid-19-risk-but-in-us-college-towns-deaths-rose-fast-926764.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/大学/">#大学</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/返回/">#返回</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/rose/">#rose</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/学生/">#学生</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
