One evening in 2018, five months after her wedding, the 21-year-old college student was visiting her parents in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, when her husband showed up unannounced, his father and uncle in tow.</p><p>Ayushi Sahu被伏击了。婚礼结束五个月后的2018年一个晚上，这位21岁的大学生正在印度中部恰蒂斯加尔邦（Chhattisgarh）探望父母，当时她的丈夫突然出现，父亲和叔叔被拖走了。</p><p> As the men settled in the living room, her husband said he had something he wanted them to hear. He took out his mobile phone and pressed “play.” The audio was loud and clear: private conversations between Sahu and her friends and family,  which had been recorded without her permission. And it wasn’t only audio: “call logs, SMS, and WhatsApp messages, each photo and video, recordings of my video calls — he claimed to have accessed everything,” Sahu said. That was when she realized that her husband had, for months, been spying on her.</p><p> 当这些人在客厅安顿下来时，她的丈夫说他有一些他想让他们听到的东西。他拿出手机，按“播放”。音频声音清晰：萨胡（Sahu）与她的朋友和家人之间的私人对话，未经她的许可而记录下来。不仅是音频：“通话记录，短信和WhatsApp消息，每张照片和视频，我的视频通话记录-他声称已经访问了所有内容，” Sahu说。那时她才意识到丈夫已经监视了她几个月。</p><p> This was also how Sahu learned of certain things he had been holding against her. (Her name has been changed to protect against retaliation.) He had been offended to hear her complaining to her mother about problems with her in-laws. And he objected to her talking to a male friend. “He made a scene as if he was ‘exposing’ me,” Sahu recalled. “I was just sharing my concerns. That’s normal.”</p><p> 这也是Sahu得知他一直对她持某些态度的方式。 （她的名字已更改，以防止受到报复。）听到她向母亲抱怨她的公婆有问题，他被冒犯了。他反对她与一个男性朋友谈话。萨胡回忆说：“他的镜头就像是在'暴露'我的样子。” “我只是在分享我的担忧。那很正常。”</p><p> Her husband played several more recordings, until his father eventually intervened. “I don’t want to listen to any more of this. You have heard it all? Okay, then,” he said, before reaching out to comfort Sahu, who was still in shock.</p><p> 她的丈夫再弹了几张唱片，直到父亲最终介入。 “我不想再听这些了。你都听到了吗那好吧，”他说，然后伸手安慰仍然震惊的萨胡。</p><p> After processing the experience, Sahu decided she was willing to shrug it off, apologize, and move on, but her new husband continued to behave strangely. Eventually, she felt she had no choice but to end the marriage. “I don’t understand why he had to take this spying route,” she reflected. “He could have just asked. You know, in India, men can scold their wives, right? He could have done that. What was the need to go so deep into my phone and record my conversations?”</p><p> 处理完这些经历后，Sahu决定她愿意耸耸肩，道歉并继续前进，但是她的新丈夫仍然表现得很奇怪。最终，她觉得自己别无选择，只能结束婚姻。她说：“我不明白他为什么要走这条间谍路线。”他本可以问。你知道，在印度，男人可以责骂妻子，对吗？他本可以做到的。深入了解我的电话并记录我的对话，有什么需要？”</p><p> Sahu has no idea how her phone was bugged or for how long she was surveilled. But she has one clue: Her Vivo smartphone was an engagement gift from her husband.</p><p> 萨胡（Sahu）不知道她的手机是如何被窃听的，或者被监视了多长时间。但她有一个线索：她的Vivo智能手机是丈夫的订婚礼物。</p><p> It is likely that Sahu’s phone had off-the-shelf spyware on it. Her husband may have installed it himself or even consulted a private detective before marrying her, who provided him with the phone. In either case, he would have been part of a growing trend of individuals — often, jealous lovers — making use of personal surveillance technology.</p><p> 萨胡（Sahu）的手机上可能装有现成的间谍软件。她的丈夫可能自己安装了它，甚至在与她结婚之前咨询了私人侦探，后者为他提供了电话。无论哪种情况，他都会成为使用个人监视技术的个人（通常是嫉妒的恋人）增长趋势的一部分。 </p><p> According to Kunwar Vikram Singh, the chairman of the Association of Private Detectives and Investigators in India, it’s now common for wealthy families to assess the suitability of a potential bride or groom by hiring a private detective, a vetting that usually costs around $500. He attributes this to India’s changing social mores, especially among urban elites. “Work culture has changed. Values have changed,” Singh reflected, citing the influx of women into the workforce as one contributing factor. “We tell people, ‘You spend lakhs and crores on marital ceremonies; spend a few thousand on investigators’,” he said.</p><p>据印度私人侦探和调查员协会主席Kunwar Vikram Singh称，现在富裕的家庭通常会聘请私人侦探来评估潜在新娘或新郎的适合性，审查通常需要花费约500美元。他将其归因于印度不断变化的社会风气，尤其是在城市精英阶层中。 “工作文化已经改变。价值观已经改变。”辛格指出，女性是劳动力大军之一。 “我们告诉人们，‘您在婚姻仪式上花费了数十万英镑。在调查人员上花费了数千美元。”他说。</p><p> Whatever the reason, India’s private-detective services have been growing over the past decade. Singh estimates that the sector is now worth roughly $1.2 billion  nationally. But because of the sensitive nature of the field, it’s impossible to know for sure: There are no official statistics, and many clients still pay in cash. “They don’t want to leave any footprint,” he noted.</p><p> 无论出于何种原因，过去十年来印度的私人侦探服务一直在增长。辛格估计，该行业目前在全国的价值约为12亿美元。但是，由于该领域的敏感性质，因此无法确定：没有官方统计数据，许多客户仍用现金付款。他说：“他们不想留下任何足迹。”</p><p> The services offered by the detectives mainly fall into two categories: corporate and personal. The corporate investigations often involve banks hiring investigators to get information on shifty borrowers and financial firms looking for background checks on employees. The personal services range from child monitoring to matrimonial background checks. Every agency has its own specialization. Karnam Choudhary, a Jaipur-based detective who operates the Siyol Detective Network, which has around 1,500 freelance private investigators across the country, says that “since 2016, personal cases make up almost 70%.”</p><p> 侦探提供的服务主要分为两类：公司服务和个人服务。公司调查通常涉及银行聘请调查员以获取有关流动借款人的信息，而金融公司则需要对雇员进行背景调查。个人服务范围从儿童监护到婚姻背景检查。每个代理商都有自己的专业领域。斋浦尔的一名侦探卡尔南·乔杜里（Karnam Choudhary）经营着Siyol侦探网络，该网络在全国各地拥有约1500名自由职业者，他说：“自2016年以来，个人案件占近70％。”</p><p> The boom in business has coincided with a growing reliance on consumer-grade spyware. These are mostly smartphone apps that cannot easily be detected, secretly record all of a device’s activity, and route that data to a third-party dashboard. A private investigator’s first move used to be shadowing somebody in person; today, many of them begin by advising the client to present the object of their suspicion with a malware-infected smartphone.</p><p> 业务的迅猛发展与对消费级间谍软件的日益依赖相吻合。这些大多是智能手机应用，无法轻松检测到它们，秘密记录设备的所有活动，并将该数据路由到第三方仪表板。私家侦探的第一个举动曾经是给某人一个阴影。如今，他们中的许多人都开始建议客户使用受恶意软件感染的智能手机来表示怀疑的对象。</p><p> Growing demand for spyware first caught the attention of India’s software engineers several years ago, long before the coronavirus pandemic led to a spike. In 2013, while researching viruses and cybersecurity for his final-year engineering project, Gujarat-based coder Tushar Mepani began meeting parents who wanted to keep closer tabs on their teenagers’ whereabouts. “I could not sleep at night when these millionaires told me about their kids’ behavior,” he said, apparently in earnest. The initial prototype of  what became his first app for tracking children, EasySpyPhone, was restricted to recording calls and collecting text messages and location data, but more recent iterations can spy on social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp, secretly turn on a phone’s microphone to record calls and video, and capture screenshots, all for around $20 or $40 per month. “Parents were very happy,” Mepani reflected. “They learned who their kids are friends with — and who is diverting them. The app has saved kids from being spoiled.”</p><p> 对间谍软件的日益增长的需求在几年前就首次引起印度软件工程师的注意，而在冠状病毒大流行导致这种情况激增之前很久。 2013年，在古吉拉特邦的编码员Tushar Mepani在为他的最后一个工程项目研究病毒和网络安全时，开始与父母会面，他们希望密切关注青少年的下落。 “当这些百万富翁告诉我他们孩子的行为时，我晚上无法入睡，”他显然是认真地说道。 EasySpyPhone成为他的第一个用于跟踪孩子的应用程序的最初原型，仅限于记录呼叫以及收集短信和位置数据，但是最近的迭代可以监视Facebook和WhatsApp等社交媒体平台，秘密地打开手机的麦克风，记录通话和视频，并捕获屏幕快照，所有这些都每月约20或40美元。 “父母非常高兴，”梅帕尼反映。 “他们了解了自己的孩子是谁的朋友，以及谁在转移他们的注意力。该应用程序使孩子免于被宠坏。”</p><p>  Mepani doesn’t sell only one or two products, however; through his Android spyware company, Convants Information Security, he licenses surveillance software to multiple vendors, who repackage it under different names. He won’t reveal the details of these arrangements, calling them “internal business,” but he claims to have made more than 20,000 sales. In 2014, Choudhary, the Jaipur-based detective, used Mepani’s software to launch his  agency’s own app, Spy Mobile Process. Instead of paying for a full investigation, those who buy Choudhary’s app may use it to conduct their own inquiries, with guidance from detectives. “We had no idea at the time whether people would be interested in this,” he said. “But it clicked with users.”</p><p>  但是，Mepani不只销售一种或两种产品；通过他的Android间谍软件公司Convants Information Security，他将监视软件授权给了多个供应商，这些供应商以不同的名称对其进行了重新包装。他不会透露这些安排的细节，称其为“内部业务”，但他声称已经实现了20,000多次销售。 2014年，位于斋浦尔的侦探乔杜里（Choudhary）使用Mepani的软件启动了代理机构自己的应用程序Spy Mobile Process。购买Choudhary应用程序的人可能无需使用全面调查，而可以在侦探的指导下使用它来进行自己的查询。他说：“当时我们不知道人们是否对此感兴趣。” “但是它吸引了用户。”</p><p> All of this exists in a legal gray area. As of now, there are no laws in India regulating the selling or purchasing of so-called stalkerware. Nor is there much clarity about the privacy laws currently on the books. In India, it is not illegal to physically surveil a target, for instance, but things get fuzzier when it comes to tracking somebody’s location via mobile phone. Courts have been forced to establish statutes, case by case. In 2018, for instance, a family court in Delhi  admitted evidence collected from spyware in a case concerning a marital dispute, stating that the right to a fair trial outweighed privacy protections.</p><p> 所有这些都存在于合法的灰色区域。截至目前，印度尚无法律规范所谓的缠扰器的买卖。目前书上的隐私法也没有太多的澄清。例如，在印度，对目标进行身体监视并非非法，但是在通过手机跟踪某人的位置时，事情变得越来越模糊。法院被迫逐案制定法规。例如，在2018年，德里的一家家庭法院在涉及一桩婚姻纠纷的案件中承认从间谍软件收集的证据，表明获得公正审判的权利胜过了隐私保护。 </p><p> But staying on the right side of the law doesn’t seem to trouble many spyware vendors. Insofar as they are concerned about legal exposure, most will simply add disclaimers that place the onus on the user. Before installing software, the customer should get “proper written consent to do so by the owner of the smartphone” and understand that it is the “responsibility of the buyer to obey all laws of their country.”</p><p>但是，保持法律的正确性似乎并不会给许多间谍软件供应商带来麻烦。就他们担心法律风险而言，大多数人只会添加免责声明，使用户承担责任。在安装软件之前，客户应获得“智能手机所有者的书面同意”，并理解这是“买方遵守其所在国家/地区的所有法律的责任”。</p><p> In August 2020, Google introduced a new Ads Policy imposing restrictions on advertising for spyware and surveillance technology. “The updated policy will prohibit the promotion of products or services that are marketed or targeted with the express purpose of tracking or monitoring another person or their activities without their authorization,” the company wrote in its updated policy. However, Google made two exceptions: “private investigation services,” like Choudhary’s, and “products or services designed for parents to track or monitor their underage children,” like Mepani’s.</p><p> 2020年8月，Google出台了新的广告政策，对间谍软件和监视技术的广告施加了限制。该公司在更新后的政策中写道：“更新后的政策将禁止促销以明确跟踪或监视他人或其活动为目的的市场或目标产品或服务。”但是，谷歌有两个例外：“私人侦查服务”（如Choudhary的产品）和“为父母跟踪或监视未成年子女而设计的产品或服务”（如Mepani的产品或服务）。</p><p> Private detectives who admit to using spyware almost universally insist that any problems stemming from it are the result of abuse. But what they say publicly is one thing, and how they market their services is another. While Choudhary claims his app is not intended for spying on spouses, a  November 2015 tweet from his company’s official account said just the opposite. In a series of phone interviews, Mepani also denied marketing his product to jealous husbands and wives, even as his website made clear that these are target demographics. “But you know,” he added, “it is like a knife. You can cut fruits, or you can cut someone’s head.”</p><p> 承认使用间谍软件的私家侦探几乎普遍坚持认为，由间谍软件引起的任何问题都是滥用的结果。但是他们公开说的是一回事，而他们如何推销其服务则是另一回事。虽然Choudhary声称他的应用程序并非旨在监视配偶，但该公司官方帐户在2015年11月发布的一条推文却恰恰相反。在一系列电话采访中，Mepani还否认向嫉妒的丈夫和妻子销售他的产品，即使他的网站明确指出这些是目标人群。他补充说：“但你知道，这就像一把刀。您可以切水果，也可以切别人的头。”</p><p> However unsettling, the spyware sector is only one small part of a much vaster infrastructure. More than 500 million people in India use the internet every month, creating troves of private information with every click, scroll, swipe, and download. What they watch, how they date, whom they work for, and where they spend their money is constantly being captured and monetized. All this has given rise to a multimillion-dollar dark data economy, in which no piece of information is too personal to trade.</p><p> 尽管令人不安，但间谍软件领域只是庞大基础设施中的一小部分。每月有超过5亿印度人使用互联网，每次单击，滚动，滑动和下载时，都会创建大量私人信息。他们的目光，约会方式，工作的人以及花钱的地方不断被捕获和货币化。所有这些都导致了价值数百万美元的黑暗数据经济，其中没有任何信息过于个人化而无法交易。</p><p>    The black market for data, as it exists online in India, resembles those for wholesale vegetables or smuggled goods. Customers are encouraged to buy in bulk, and the variety of what’s on offer is mind-boggling: There are databases about parents, cable customers, pregnant women, pizza eaters, mutual funds investors, and almost any niche group one can imagine. A typical database consists of a spreadsheet with row after row of names and key details: Sheila Gupta, 35, lives in Kolkata, runs a travel agency, and owns a BMW; Irfaan Khan, 52, lives in Greater Noida, and has a son who just applied to engineering college. The databases are usually updated every three months (the older one is, the less it is worth), and if you buy several at the same time, you’ll get a discount. Business is always brisk, and transactions are conducted quickly. No one will ask you for your name, let alone inquire why you want the phone numbers of five million people who have applied for bank loans.</p><p>    印度的在线黑市数据类似于批发蔬菜或走私货物的黑市。鼓励客户大量购买，而所提供的各种服务令人难以置信：这里有关于父母，有线电视客户，孕妇，比萨饼吃者，共同基金投资者以及几乎所有可以想象的利基市场的数据库。一个典型的数据库由一个带有一行一行的名称和关键详细信息的电子表格组成：现年35岁的Sheila Gupta居住在加尔各答，经营一家旅行社，并拥有一辆宝马；现年52岁的Irfaan Khan居住在大诺伊达（Greater Noida），有一个儿子刚刚申请工程学院。这些数据库通常每三个月更新一次（越旧的数据库，它的价值就越小），如果您同时购买多个数据库，则会获得折扣。生意总是很活跃，交易很快。没有人会问你的名字，更不用说问为什么你要500万申请银行贷款的人的电话号码了。</p><p> There isn’t a reliable estimate of the size of India’s data economy or of how much money it generates annually. Regarding the former, each broker we spoke to had a different guess: One said only about one or two hundred professionals make up the top tier, another that every big Indian city has at least a thousand people trading data. To find them, potential customers need only look for their ads on social media or run searches with industry keywords and hashtags — “data,” “leads,” “database” — combined with detailed information about the kind of data they want and the city they want it from.</p><p> 无法可靠地估算印度的数据经济规模或每年产生多少收入。关于前者，我们与之交谈的每个经纪人都有不同的猜测：一个人说只有约一两百名专业人士组成了顶级经纪人，另一个人则说每个印度大城市都有至少一千人交易数据。要找到他们，潜在客户只需要在社交媒体上寻找他们的广告或使用行业关键字和标签（“数据”，“潜在客户”，“数据库”）以及有关他们想要的数据类型和城市的详细信息进行搜索他们想要它。</p><p> Privacy experts believe that the data-brokering industry has existed since the early days of the internet’s arrival in India. “Databases have been bought and sold in India for at least 15 years now. I remember a case from way back in 2006 of leaked employee data from Naukri.com (one of India’s first online job portals) being sold on CDs,” says Nikhil Pahwa, the editor and publisher of  MediaNama, which covers technology policy. By 2009, data brokers were running SMS-marketing companies that offered complementary services: procuring targeted data and sending text messages in bulk. Back then, there was simply less data, “and those who had it could sell it at whatever price,” says Himanshu Bhatt, a data broker who claims to be retired. That is no longer the case: “Today, everyone has every kind of data,” he said.</p><p> 隐私权专家认为，自Internet进入印度初期以来，数据经纪行业就已经存在。 “数据库在印度的买卖至少已有15年了。我记得2006年发生的一起案例，其中一个案例是Naukri.com（印度最早的在线招聘门户网站之一）泄露的员工数据以CD形式出售，” MediaNama的编辑和出版商Nikhil Pahwa说，该书涵盖了技术政策。到2009年，数据经纪人开始经营SMS营销公司，这些公司提供补充服务：购买目标数据和批量发送短信。那时，数据已经很少了，“声称拥有这些数据的人可以以任何价格出售它。”声称退休的数据经纪人希曼舒·巴特（Himanshu Bhatt）说。事实不再如此：“今天，每个人都有各种各样的数据，”他说。 </p><p> No broker we contacted would openly discuss their methods of hunting, harvesting, and selling data. But the day-to-day work generally consists of following the trails that people leave during their travels around the internet. Brokers trawl data storage websites armed with a digital fishing net. “I was shocked when I was surfing [cloud-hosted data sites] one day and came across Aadhaar cards,” Bhatt remarked, referring to India’s state-issued biometric ID cards. Images of them were available to download in bulk, alongside completed loan applications and salary sheets.</p><p>我们联系的任何经纪人都不会公开讨论其搜集，收集和出售数据的方法。但是，日常工作通常包括跟踪人们在互联网上旅行时留下的足迹。经纪人拖曳配备有数字捕鱼网的数据存储网站。 Bhatt说：“有一天，当我在[云托管的数据站点]上冲浪并遇到Aadhaar卡时，我感到非常震惊。”他指的是印度政府发行的生物识别ID卡。它们的图像以及已完成的贷款申请和薪水表可批量下载。</p><p> Again, the legal boundaries here are far from clear. Anybody who has ever filled out a form on a coupon website or requested a refund for a movie ticket has effectively entered their information into a database that can be sold without their consent by the company it belongs to. A neighborhood cell phone store can sell demographic information to a political party for hyperlocal campaigning, and a fintech company  can stealthily transfer an individual’s details from an astrology app onto its own server, to gauge that person’s creditworthiness. When somebody shares employment history on LinkedIn or contact details on a public directory, brokers can use basic software such as web scrapers to extract that data.</p><p> 再次，这里的法律界限还很不清楚。任何曾经在优惠券网站上填写表格或要求退还电影票的人都已经有效地将其信息输入数据库，该数据库无需经过所属公司的同意即可出售。一家附近的手机商店可以向一个政党出售人口统计信息，以进行超本地化竞选活动，而一家金融科技公司可以将某人的详细信息从占星术应用秘密传输到其自己的服务器上，以评估该人的信誉。当某人在LinkedIn上共享工作经历或在公共目录上的联系方式时，经纪人可以使用基本的软件（例如网络抓取工具）提取该数据。</p><p> But why bother hacking into a database when you can buy it outright? More often, “brokers will directly approach a bank employee and tell them, ‘I need the high-end database’,” Bhatt said. And as demand for information increases, so, too, does data vulnerability. A 2019 survey found that 69% of Indian companies haven’t set up reliable data security systems; 44% have experienced at least one breach already. “In the past 12 months, we have seen an increasing trend of Indians’ data [appearing] on the dark web,” says Beenu Arora, the CEO of the global cyberintelligence firm Cyble.</p><p> 但是，当您可以直接购买数据库时，为什么还要打扰到数据库呢？ Bhatt说：“更多时候，经纪人会直接与银行职员联系，并告诉他们，'我需要高端数据库'。”随着信息需求的增长，数据漏洞也会增加。 2019年的一项调查发现，印度有69％的公司尚未建立可靠的数据安全系统； 44％已经经历了至少一次违规。 “在过去的12个月里，印度人的数据（出现在黑暗的网络上）呈上升趋势，”全球网络情报公司Cyble的首席执行官Beenu Arora说。</p><p> When contacted about providing a sample database, Amresh, the owner of  e-commercedatabase.in, would not reveal the source of his data, nor did he ask any questions of us. All he wanted in exchange was our email addresses and phone numbers. The database arrived instantly, containing information that would make most online shoppers shudder: not only the names, email addresses, phone numbers, and states of residence of thousands of people but also what they bought and how much they paid for it, from cotton pajamas ($27) to noise-cancelling headphones ($408). For $20, we could purchase the full stash, containing the personal details of 14 million people.</p><p> 在联系提供示例数据库时，e-commercedatabase.in的所有者Amresh不会透露其数据来源，也不会向我们提出任何问题。他想要交换的只是我们的电子邮件地址和电话号码。该数据库立即到达，其中包含使大多数在线购物者不寒而栗的信息：不仅是数千人的姓名，电子邮件地址，电话号码和居住状态，而且还包括他们从棉质睡衣上购买的商品和支付的金额（27美元）到降噪耳机（408美元）。只要花20美元，我们就可以购买全部储藏品，其中包含1400万人的个人详细信息。</p><p>    Scams are one of the easiest ways to turn data into cash. Loan scammers lap up bank customers’ personal details, refund scammers cash in on e-commerce histories, and job scammers do anything they can to get their hands on information from employment portals. Within this economy, some databases are more prized than others. A set featuring high-net-worth individuals costs more than one featuring entry-level employees. Value also goes up and down depending on the season; a shoppers’ database is hotter before a major Indian festival than after it. But there is one kind worth far more than any other. “Right now,” Bhatt said, “the student database is a gold mine.”</p><p>    诈骗是将数据转化为现金的最简单方法之一。贷款诈骗者会泄露银行客户的个人详细信息，退款诈骗者会在电子商务历史中变现，工作诈骗者会竭尽所能从就业门户获取信息。在这种经济环境下，某些数据库比其他数据库更有价值。一套由高净值个人组成的套装要比由入门级员工组成的一套要贵。价值也随季节而上升或下降。在大型印度节日之前，购物者的数据库比在大型节日之后的数据库要热。但是，有一种价值远远超过其他任何一种。巴特说：“现在，学生数据库是一座金矿。”</p><p> The competition for a place in India’s top professional colleges is cutthroat, and the hustle for admission begins early. By the time a student enters high school, they have already taken a few preparatory tests, and their academic information is likely stored in more than one database. Toward the end of high school, many students will be busy preparing for either the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE), for engineering colleges, or the National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET), for medical colleges — the results of which are also available in the databases, along with grades, application numbers, and the names and phone numbers of students and parents. These are, in effect, elaborate, detailed listings for thousands of people desperate enough to spend tens of thousands of dollars for any possible educational advantage.</p><p> 在印度顶级专业学院中争夺一席之地的竞争是残酷的，入学的争夺尽早开始。到学生进入高中时，他们已经参加了一些准备考试，并且他们的学术信息可能存储在多个数据库中。高中快要结束时，许多学生将忙于为工程学院的联合入学考试（JEE）或为医学院校的国家资格入学考试（NEET）作准备-考试结果也可在大学数据库，以及年级，申请号以及学生和父母的姓名和电话号码。实际上，这些清单是为数千名绝望的人精心制作的详细清单，他们花了数万美元来获取任何可能的教育优势。</p><p> To buy a dataset from sites like  mobiledatabase.com, which has since shuttered but was one of many websites of its kind, interested parties must contact the mobile number flashing on the homepage. That number belongs to Harry Singh (not his real name), who insists on communicating only through WhatsApp. So that’s how we strike a deal — 2020 NEET data for $20. He suggests payment via a digital wallet and, after the money is transferred, sends over the database as a Google sheet. Asked if the data is trustworthy, he confirms that “these databases are leaked by NEET employees.”</p><p> 要从mobiledatabase.com之类的网站上购买数据集，此网站已关闭但仍是同类网站中的许多，感兴趣的各方必须联系主页上闪烁的手机号码。该号码属于Harry Singh（不是他的真实姓名），后者坚持仅通过WhatsApp进行交流。这就是我们达成交易的方式-2020年NEET数据的价格为20美元。他建议通过数字钱包付款，并在汇款后将其作为Google表格通过数据库发送。当被问及数据是否可信时，他确认“这些数据库已被NEET员工泄漏”。 </p><p> Who would buy this data, aside from curious journalists? Admissions fixers. At the end of the JEE and NEET application process every year, fixers, armed with data leaked by insiders and sold by brokers, reach out to thousands of prospective applicants with offers to guarantee their admission to medical and engineering colleges. Which, of course, they almost never can. Anwar Hussain, a Delhi-based doctor, was the victim of one of these scams. In May 2019, his son, Dilkash, took the NEET exam in the hopes of entering his father’s profession. “On 7 June,” Husain recalled, “results came in. Even before we checked the website, I received a call from a fixer. She knew my son’s registration number. She told me he had passed the test, but his rank was low. Admission to a reputed college would be tough, but it could be managed, I was told. She said I should speak to her boss — someone called Bhushan.”</p><p>除了好奇的记者，谁还会购买这些数据？入学修复工具。在每年的JEE和NEET申请流程结束时，固定人拥有内部人员泄露的数据并由经纪人出售，可以联系成千上万的潜在申请人，并提供要约以保证其被医学和工程学院录取。当然，他们几乎永远也做不到。德里的一名医生安瓦尔·侯赛因（Anwar Hussain）是这些骗局之一的受害者。 2019年5月，他的儿子迪尔卡什（Dilkash）参加了NEET考试，希望进入父亲的职业。侯赛因回忆说：“ 6月7日，结果出来了。甚至在我们检查网站之前，我就收到了来自固定器的电话。她知道我儿子的注册号码。她告诉我他已经通过了考试，但是他的排名很低。有人告诉我，入读一所著名的大学很难，但可以管理。她说我应该和她的老板说话-一个叫Bhushan的人。”</p><p> Husain visited the fixers’ office in Delhi, where they asked for a $6,600 advance and told Husain to arrange to pay several times that amount in tuition fees. Over the following weeks, Husain sold the house he had bought with his life’s savings, asked his brothers to sell his share of the family land in their ancestral village, and filled three envelopes with cash. He paid the $6,600 to Bhushan and his associates and an additional $27,000 to an admissions officer at a medical college in the neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh.</p><p> 侯赛因拜访了位于德里的检修人员办公室，要求他们预付6600美元，并告诉侯赛因安排支付几倍于此的学费。在接下来的几周中，侯赛因出售了他用毕生积蓄购买的房屋，要求兄弟们出售他在祖传村庄的家庭土地份额，并用现金装满三个信封。他向邻近的北方邦的一所医学院的Bhushan及其同事支付了6,600美元，并向其招生官支付了27,000美元。</p><p> Husain’s family was driven back to Delhi by the fixers, and for several weeks, he didn’t hear anything from either the brokers or college authorities. He began to worry. “By September 20,” he said, “we knew we had been scammed.” The following March, the ringleader of the scam was arrested by Delhi police after an interstate chase. Luckily for Husain, he was ultimately repaid the amount he had been defrauded of.</p><p> 侯赛因的家人被修理工赶回德里，好几个星期以来，他都没有从经纪人或大学当局那里听到任何消息。他开始担心。他说：“到9月20日，我们已经被骗了。”次年3月，该骗局的头目在州际追捕后被德里警方逮捕。幸运的是，对于侯赛因，他最终得到了被骗的款项。</p><p> Data privacy cases rarely make headlines in India. News of the NEET scams first broke in 2018 when a student sent evidence of the leaks to media outlets. “I tried to find out where the fixers got our numbers and, searching online, came  across around 30 websites trading students’ data,” says student activist Vivek Pandey, who provided evidence of the scam. “Ninety percent of these calls end up in fraud.” The matter was discussed in Parliament and handed over to India’s Central Bureau of Investigation. The sites were eventually shut down, Pandey said, “but the next year, they came back with different names. I could spot at least four or five websites that looked exactly the same.” Pandey estimates that between 100 and 150 student-data leaks are reported every year across India, and the scams flare up again and again with remarkable regularity.</p><p> 数据隐私案件很少在印度成为头条新闻。 NEET骗局的新闻于2018年首次爆发，当时一名学生向媒体发布了泄漏证据。学生活动家维维克·潘迪（Vivek Pandey）说：“我试图找出修复者在哪里获取我们的号码，并在网上搜索时发现了大约30个交易学生数据的网站。” “这些电话中有90％以欺诈告终。”此事已在国会讨论，并移交给印度中央调查局。 Pandey说，这些站点最终被关闭了，“但是第二年，它们又以不同的名称再次出现。我可以发现至少四个或五个看起来完全一样的网站。” Pandey估计，印度每年报告的学生数据泄露事件在100到150之间，并且骗局以惊人的规律性不断地爆发。</p><p> For now, police are focusing on the scammers who orchestrate these frauds and ignoring the data brokers who provide them with material. In the authorities’ view, one party is committing a clearly defined crime, while another is simply trading an Excel sheet. Prosecution is especially difficult, given that many victims often have no idea how their data was leaked in the first place. But if they do find out, “it’s necessary for people to sue data brokers for violation of their privacy,”  said Pahwa from  MediaNama. “They should be arrested for putting people at risk and being an accessory to fraud. Otherwise, with the kind of information that’s on sale, from home address to spouse’s name, it becomes very easy to harm someone.”</p><p> 目前，警方正将重点放在精心策划这些欺诈行为的骗子身上，而忽略了向其提供材料的数据经纪人。当局认为，一方在犯有明确定义的罪行，而另一方只是在交易Excel表。鉴于许多受害者通常一开始都不知道其数据如何泄漏，因此起诉特别困难。但是，如果他们确实找到了答案，“ MediaNama的Pahwa说：“人们有必要起诉数据经纪人侵犯其隐私权，” “他们应因将人们置于危险之中并作为欺诈的辅助手段而被捕。否则，通过出售的各种信息（从家庭住址到配偶的名字），很容易会伤害他人。”</p><p>     There have been several instances of brokers ending up in court in recent years. In 2017, the telecom Reliance Jio filed a data-theft complaint with Mumbai police after a trove of customer data was put up for sale on a suspicious website. It turned out that the data had been stolen from its servers by a computer-science dropout from a small city in Rajasthan.  The following year, Chennai city police arrested the owners of three data firms for selling information lea</p><p>     近年来，有几起经纪人在法院告终的案件。 2017年，电信公司Reliance Jio在大量可疑网站上出售了大量客户数据后，向孟买警方提起了数据盗窃投诉。事实证明，来自拉贾斯坦邦一个小城市的计算机科学事故使数据从服务器中被盗。次年，钦奈市警察逮捕了三家数据公司的所有者，罪名是出售信息泄露</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://restofworld.org/2020/all-the-data-fit-to-sell/">https://restofworld.org/2020/all-the-data-fit-to-sell/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/database/">#database</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/数据库/">#数据库</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/印度/">#印度</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
