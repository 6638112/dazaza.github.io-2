All results are generated by our end-to-end model HifiFace-512. If you want to see more celebrity demos, please refer to our supplementary material.             In this work, we propose a high fidelity face swapping method, called HifiFace, which can well preserve the face shape of the source face and generate photo-realistic results. Unlike other existing face swapping works that only use face recognition model to keep the identity similarity, we propose 3D shape-aware identity to control the face shape with the geometric supervision from 3DMM and 3D face reconstruction method. Meanwhile, we introduce the Semantic Facial Fusion module to optimize the combination of encoder and decoder features and make adaptive blending, which makes the results more photo-realistic. Extensive experiments on wild faces demonstrate that our method can preserve better identity, especially on the face shape, and can generate more photo-realistic results than previous state-of-the-art methods.\n       This is a selected video generated from FaceForensics++ Dataset.     We have prepared 1000 fake videos of well-known forgery detection dataset FaceForensics++. We strictly follow the source and target pair settings of FF++. Besides, we also generated 10k frames of FF++ videos for quantitative test, which is widely adopted by recent face swapping research.     If you would like to access our FF++ videos, you can download them from either Google Drive or Baidu Netdisk.             The md5sum of the compressed file is 5b596ac8025c25f69f24fd7783ec8133. It contains 1k manipulated videos and a config file. The config file indicates which frame of the original video is used as the identity&#39;s source image. The frame is numbered from zero.

Less than 100 miles north of New York City, Ulster County is popular destination for weekenders headed to Woodstock or the Catskill Mountains. Though pretty, there are pockets of poverty. The county is working with the Center for Guaranteed Income Research at the University of Pennsylvania on a pilot program funded by private donations.One hundred households making less than $46,900 a year in May began receiving a $500 payment each month for a year. Recipients of the money can spend it as they wish, but will be asked to participate in periodic surveys about their physical health, mental health and employment status. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)\n Annette Steele isn&#39;t destitute or unemployed. But for a year she&#39;ll be receiving $500 per month in no-strings-attached payments as part of an experimental universal basic income program in upstate New York.\n Places from Compton, California, to Richmond, Virginia, are trying out guaranteed income programs, which gained more attention after the pandemic idled millions of workers.\n Steele, a special education school aide, is getting her payments through a program in Ulster County, which covers parts of the Catskill Mountains and the Hudson River Valley.\n During the pilot program, funded by private donations, 100 county residents making less than $46,900 annually will get $500 a month for a year. The income threshold was based on 80% of the county\u2019s average median income, meaning it includes both the poor and a slice of the middle class \u2014 people who face financial stress but might not ordinarily qualify for government aid based on income.\n  For researchers, the pilot could give them a fuller picture of what happens when a range of people are sent payments that guarantee a basic living.\n For Steele, 57, it\u2019s a welcome financial boost that helped her pay for car insurance and groceries.\n \u201cIt lessens my bills,\u201d said Steele, who lives in the village of Ellenville with her retired husband. \u201cPeople think because you\u2019ve been working so many years, that you make this tremendous amount of money. But no, actually.\u201d\n Less than 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of New York City, Ulster County is a popular destination for weekenders headed to Woodstock or the Catskill Mountains. Its big city, Kingston, is small, with 23,000 people.\n Basic income programs elsewhere tend to focus on cities. In contrast, this upstate program stretches out over a mix of places: a city, small towns and remote areas many miles from bus lines and supermarkets.\n \u201cShowing that this approach will work not just in urban areas, but for rural parts of the country \u2014 which we know is one of our big national problems \u2014 I think there\u2019s great opportunity there,\u201d said Ulster County Executive Patrick Ryan.\n  Ryan saw cash payments as a way to help local families struggling to get ahead, or even get by, as the pandemic ebbs. Many people in the county were already stretched thin by housing costs before the pandemic, when a large influx of New York City residents led to skyrocketing real estate prices, he said.\n The first payments were made in mid-May. Recipients of the money can spend it as they wish, but will be asked to participate in periodic surveys about their physical health, mental health and employment status.\n The Center for Guaranteed Income Research at the University of Pennsylvania, which the school formed with the Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, is evaluating the pilot program.\n Recipient Eric Luna, a 26-year-old electrical lab technician, said the money will help pay the bills at the home he recently helped his parents buy in Wallkill. But he also hopes to set some aside, possibly for a master\u2019s degree.\n  \u201cI\u2019m also learning how to save money as well,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this will be a learning experience.\u201d\n There were more than 4,200 applicants for the program in a county of 178,000 people. Center for Guaranteed Income Research co-founder Stacia West, who is evaluating more than 20 such pilot programs, is interested in seeing how spending compares to cities like Stockton, California, where more that a third went for food.\n \u201cKnowing what we know about barriers to employment, especially in rural areas, we may see more money going toward transportation than we\u2019ve ever seen before in any other experiment,\u201d said West, also a professor at the University of Tennessee College of Social Work. \u201cBut it remains to be seen.\u201d\n Proponents of guaranteed incomes say recipients can decide how to spend the money best \u2014 be it food, job searches or to replace a refrigerator. The money can complement the existing social safety net, they say, or can be used as an emergency response when the economy starts tanking.\n  The end goal for a number of advocates is a universal basic income, or UBI, which would distribute cash payment programs for all adults.\n The UBI idea helped fuel a stronger-than-expected Democratic presidential primary run last year by Andrew Yang, who proposed $1,000 a month for every American adult.\n Yang, who has a second home in Ulster County, is now running for New York City mayor with a basic income proposal to help lower-income residents.\n Officials say Yang hasn\u2019t been involved in Ulster&#39;s program, but that the nonprofit he founded, Humanity Forward, was helpful in sharing experiences on starting a UBI pilot.\n Critics of cash transfer programs worry about their effectiveness and cost compared to aid programs that target funds for food, shelter or for help raising children.\n Drake University economics professor Heath Henderson is concerned the programs miss needier people less likely to apply, including those without homes.\n  While there are times people might benefit from a cash infusion, the money is unlikely to address the structural issues holding people back, like inadequate health care and schools, he said.\n \u201cIf we keep thinking about remedying poverty in terms of just throwing cash at people, you\u2019re not thinking about the structures that kind of reproduce poverty in the first place and you\u2019re not really solving the problem at all,\u201d Henderson said.\n Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

", "note_en": "It\u2019s also further evidence that extraterrestrials should&#39;ve settled the entire Milky Way by now. So where are they?\n A new computer simulation shows that a technologically advanced civilization, even when using slow ships, can still colonize an entire galaxy in a modest amount of time. The finding presents a possible model for interstellar migration and a sharpened sense of where we might find alien intelligence.\n  Space, we are told time and time again, is huge, and that\u2019s why we have yet to see signs of extraterrestrial intelligence. For sure, the distances between stars are vast, but it\u2019s important to remember that the universe is also very, very old. In fact, I\u2019d go so far as to say that, in terms of extremes, the Milky Way galaxy is more ancient than it is huge, if that makes sense.\n It\u2019s for this reason that I tend to dismiss distances as a significant variable when discussing the Fermi Paradox\u2014the observation that we have yet to see any evidence for the existence of alien intelligence, even though we probably should have.\n    New   research published in The American Astronomical Society is bolstering my conviction. The new paper, co-authored by Jason Wright, an astronomer and astrophysicist at Penn State, and Caleb Scharf, an astrobiologist at Columbia University, shows that even the most conservative estimates of civilizational expansion can still result in a galactic empire.\n   A simulation produced by the team shows the process at work, as a lone technological civilization, living in a hypothetical Milky Way-like galaxy, begins the process of galactic expansion. Grey dots in the visualization represent unsettled stars, magenta spheres represent settled stars, and the white cubes are starships in transit. The computer code and the mathematical analysis for this was project were written at the University of Rochester by Jonathan Carroll-Nellenback. Astronomer Adam Frank from the University of Rochester also participated in the study.\n    Things start off slow in the simulation, but the civilization\u2019s rate of spread really picks up once the power of exponential growth kicks in. But that\u2019s only part of the story; the expansion rate is heavily influenced by the increased density of stars near the galactic center and a patient policy, in which the settlers wait for the stars to come to them, a result of the galaxy spinning on its axis.\n  The whole process, in which the entire inner galaxy is settled, takes one billion years. That sounds like a long time, but it\u2019s only somewhere between 7% and 9% the total age of the Milky Way galaxy.\n Another neat aspect of the video is that it shows a civilization transitioning from Kardashev II status\u2014in which it harnesses the power of entire star systems\u2014to a full-blown Kardashev III civilization, which has tapped into the energy output of the entire galaxy (more about the Kardashev scale   here).\n  That a civilization might want to embark on such an ambitious enterprise might seem implausible, but it\u2019s important to remember Steven J. Dick\u2019s Intelligence Principle, which states that the \u201cmaintenance, improvement and perpetuation of knowledge and intelligence is the central driving force of cultural evolution, and that to the extent intelligence can be improved, it will be improved,\u201d as the science historian wrote in his 2003 paper, \u201c  Cultural Evolution, the Postbiological Universe and SETI.\u201d Our civilization keeps pushing the envelope of what\u2019s possible, and we have no reason to believe this urge will cease any time soon. Hence the assumption that advanced civilizations will eventually seek to occupy every corner of the galaxy and   set up camp around precious energy sources, namely stars.\n My personal hero, the late Carl Sagan, thought it possible that alien civilizations might spawn colonization waves, but he   argued that it would take an inordinate amount of time for a civilization to reach Kardashev III status, if ever. The new paper, however, imagines the transition as happening far faster than previously assumed, even under some unreasonably conservative assumptions.\n   The starting point for the new paper was a   model of expansion devised by the same team in 2019, in which the scientists showed \u201chow even slow-moving ships, like the ones humanity makes today, can settle the galaxy in much less time than the galaxy has been around\u2014if they can last long enough to make the trip to the nearest stars,\u201d as Wright explained in an email.\n  The new simulation presents one example of what this process might actually look like, showing the pace and physical shape of the galactic-scale spread. It also shows how stellar motions are likely to play a significant role. The \u201cstars themselves are moving around, so once you settle a nearby system, the star moves you to another part of the galaxy where more new stars will wander by and give you another nearby star to settle,\u201d said Wright.\n As noted, the new model is constrained by some very conservative rules. Migration ships are launched once every 10,000 years, and no civilization can last longer than 100 million years. Ships can travel no farther than 10 light-years and at speeds no faster than 6.2 miles per second (10 kilometers per second), which is comparable to human probes like the Voyager and New Horizons spacecraft.\n  \u201cThis means we\u2019re not talking about a rapidly or aggressively expanding species, and there\u2019s no warp drive or anything,\u201d said Wright. \u201cThere\u2019s just ships that do things we could actually manage to do with something like technology we can design today, perhaps fast ships using solar sails powered by giant lasers, or just very long-lived ships that can make journeys of 100,000 years running on ordinary rockets and gravitational slingshots from giant planets.\u201d\n  Even under these conditions, the entire inner part of the simulated galaxy became settled in a billion years. But as Wright reminded me, our \u201cgalaxy is over 10 billion years old, so it could have happened many times over, even with those parameters.\u201d\n  Interestingly, the simulation also shows \u201chow rapidly expansion occurs once the settlement front reaches the galactic bulge and center,\u201d as the astronomers wrote in their paper. Stars near the core are much closer to each other, so that tracks, but it\u2019s \u201cstriking to see it happen in the video,\u201d said Wright. The new video \u201cconfirms and validates previous work showing that the centers of galaxies are promising search directions for SETI [the search for extraterrestrial intelligence],\u201d according to the paper.\n Wright admitted that the simulation relies on very simple assumptions. Accordingly, the team is now working on a more realistic simulation that will allow for greater variation in these parameters, while also allowing civilizations to get both better and worse at interstellar travel.\n  The new paper enhances our understanding of the Fermi Paradox in that, \u201cif there are spacefaring species, then they have had plenty of time to settle the entire galaxy by now, even without sci-fi tricks like warp drive,\u201d Wright explained. Unlike me, however, Wright is not troubled by the Fermi Paradox, saying there are \u201clots of reasons why\u201d we haven\u2019t noticed aliens yet. (I will dig into this further for a future article, so stand by.)\n \u201cIn fact, I\u2019d be surprised if we had!\u201d he added. \u201cRather, this is very good for SETI optimists who feel there should be lots of places in the galaxy that have technology we might be able to detect from Earth.\u201d\n  Indeed, SETI scientists are already wise to the fact that the galactic center might be a good place to look. Unfortunately, a   recent survey of the galactic center came up empty handed, but there\u2019s a lesson in the new paper: It\u2019s important to be methodical and patient. We just have to keep looking, regardless of whether aliens are out there or not.\n Senior staff reporter at Gizmodo specializing in astronomy, space exploration, SETI, archaeology, bioethics, animal intelligence, human enhancement, and risks posed by AI and other advanced tech.\n        It\u2019s why the Zoo/Non-Interference Hypothesis might be pretty solid. If one civilization got an early start and effectively swept across the galaxy in a few hundred to a billion years before any rivals could pop up, then you only need that one civilization to take a paternalistic/isolationistic view of new civilizations for it to work. They\u2019re effectively in a position where they can enforce it against any new galactic upstarts not yet capable of interstellar travel.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 10:45:54", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7ecf\u7eb1,wouldn,\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb", "title": "\u5916\u661f\u4eba\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7ecf\u7eb1\u9a71\u52a8\u5668\u6765\u63a5\u7ba1\u6574\u4e2a\u661f\u7cfb\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u8868\u660e ", "title_en": "Aliens Wouldn't Need Warp Drives to Take Over an Entire Galaxy, Simulation Suggests", "transed": 1, "url": "https://gizmodo.com/aliens-wouldnt-need-warp-drives-to-take-over-an-entire-1847101242", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7ecf\u7eb1", "wouldn", "\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "db782b17f9699d8f6f70cb2b7bf31079.jpg", "infoid": 1067119, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "2002\u5e74\uff0c\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u7684Jeff Bezos\u53d1\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4efd\u8fdb\u5165\u6280\u672f\u884c\u4e1a\u4f73\u80fd\u7684\u5907\u5fd8\u5f55\u3002\u5907\u5fd8\u5f55\uff08\u79f0\u4e3a\u201cAPI\u6388\u6743\u201d\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u6280\u672f\u7684\u9648\u8ff0\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7531\u6280\u672f\u4eba\u5458\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6b23\u8d4f\u5e76\u88ab\u9ad8\u7ba1\u5b8c\u5168\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e0d\u5e78\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u6beb\u4e0d\u5938\u5f20\u5730\u8bf4\uff0cAPI\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u5168\u5c06\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e1a\u52a1\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5176\u6210\u529f\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4e0e\u5168\u7403\u6280\u672f\u6cf0\u5766\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u4e8b\u60c5\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u53ef\u4ee5\u590d\u5236\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4e4e\u4efb\u4f55\u4e1a\u52a1\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\n \u5728\u8fd9\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u8ba8\u8bba\u5907\u5fd8\u5f55\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u6fc0\u8fdb\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8f6c\u578b\u521b\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6fc0\u52b1\u3002\n   \u5141\u8bb8\u6ca1\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u8fdb\u7a0b\u901a\u4fe1\uff1a\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u94fe\u63a5\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u8bfb\u53d6\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u50a8\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u80cc\u95e8\u3002\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u901a\u4fe1\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u8fc7\u670d\u52a1\u63a5\u53e3\u8c03\u7528\u3002\n \u4ed6\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u4ec0\u4e48\u6280\u672f\u5e76\u4e0d\u91cd\u8981\u3002 HTTP\uff0cCORBA\uff0cPUBSUB\uff0c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u534f\u8bae -

The memo, known as the \u201cAPI Mandate\u201d, is generally perceived as being a statement about technology at Amazon, and is therefore widely admired by technologists and wholly ignored by executives. This is unfortunate, because it\u2019s no exaggeration to say that the API Mandate completely transformed Amazon as a business and laid the foundation for its success. Better still, unlike many things that global technology titans do, it is something that can be replicated and put to use by almost any business.\n In this post, we\u2019ll talk about the memo, and how it created the systems and incentives for radical organisational transformation.\n   There will be no other form of interprocess communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team\u2019s data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network.\n It doesn\u2019t matter what technology they use. HTTP, Corba, Pubsub, custom protocols \u2014 doesn\u2019t matter.\n All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions.\n To understand what this means, let\u2019s take an example. Suppose you are hired by Amazon to start selling home improvement products to the Australian market. There are a bunch of things you\u2019re going to do to get started, like getting some new product categories set up in the database, putting listings on the Amazon website, figuring out which products to stock and how many, and getting Amazon warehouses to store those products  2.\n At Amazon, each of these atomic functions is a series of API calls. An API - an Application Programming Interface - is a piece of software that allows other software to talk to it and access its functionality. APIs are found everywhere in all kinds of technologies, and this is what Bezos is referring to when he writes \u201cservice interfaces\u201d.\n  There may be several hundred of these atomic functions necessary to achieve a business outcome. In most organisations, each of them is accomplished by holding multiple meetings with myriad stakeholders, achieving alignment between teams, getting others to prioritise your work in their schedules, and other high-touch, human-centric processes. Anybody who has seen this in action at an organisation of any size will know that this can result in delays of months or years - if anything happens at all.\n In our example, the API Mandate requires the team responsible for listings on the website to expose the things that their team does as an API, rather than requiring interpersonal communication. You want a new listing? Call the API - there\u2019s your listing. No interminable meetings, misalignments, delays, or self-inflicted organisational chaos  3. These APIs are not so much  APIs as  BPIs \u2013 Business Programming Interfaces.\n The importance of this difference cannot be overstated. This is the secret to Amazon\u2019s ability to rapidly enter any market that it sets its eye on. It might seem improbable, but Amazon\u2019s incredible growth can largely be attributed to the API Mandate  4.  To paraphrase Benedict Evans, it has turned Amazon into \u201ca machine for making more Amazon\u201d.\n  The critical mechanisms for the proper operation of the API mandate are that it is systematic and that it aligns incentives.\n It is common for attempted organisational transformations to fail because enacting the transformation requires many hundreds or thousands of people to pull in the same direction, often against their own self-interest. This often devolves into a \u201cwar for hearts and minds\u201d or a \u201cculture shift\u201d, ignoring the reasons why those hearts and minds and cultures aren\u2019t already pulling in that direction.\n For transformations to take hold, they need to be based on a system of mechanisms that incentivise every individual or unit to independently reinforce the system. The systematic implications of the API Mandate are now clear, but the effectiveness of the system relies on incentive mechanisms to ensure participation.\n Amazon\u2019s system of openly available metrics incentivises every team to provide their function in a way that maximises the ability of other teams to make use of that function. In many ways, this mimics the function of the market itself - the best way to make money in a competitive market is to be as useful as possible to your customers.\n Together, the system and its incentives create a natural force pushing in the direction of organisational transformation. There is no ongoing need to cajole or threaten recalcitrant units into taking part, but rather a continual process of evolution and improvement along the vectors created by the system. Culture is an effect, not a cause.\n  The API Mandate reads as if it were written by an Engineering leader rather than the CEO. It doesn\u2019t mention anything about business goals, strategy, targets, or even products or customers. All of the things that business people care about are noticeably absent, and yet when the impact of the mandate is understood, it\u2019s probably the most important single memo in the history of business. There are three lessons to be drawn from this.\n The first lesson is that any corporate of sufficient complexity could implement the API Mandate itself and achieve at least a good approximation of Amazon\u2019s flexibility and scalability. Whether every corporate has leadership skilled enough to know how to exploit those advantages is, of course, another matter.\n The second lesson is that organisational change is achieved through systems and incentives, rather than culture. Technology is a prime catalyst for this type of change, as its structured and orderly nature lends itself to systematic application.\n The third lesson is that technology is not only much more important in business than executives would like to think, but that realising the potential of technology means fundamentally transforming the core operations of the business to exploit the characteristics of the technology. If business strategy is not developed by people with a strong, big-picture understanding of technology, then that strategy is almost certainly doomed to underperform.\n  One significant reason why there are so few businesses like Amazon might be that very few executives understand or even like technology enough to be able to effectively exploit it for competitive advantage. It\u2019s common to see even highly sophisticated companies ignoring the incentives that structure their business and ignoring the systematic approaches to business transformation that technology enables.\n The good news is that companies like Amazon have blazed clear trails for the rest of us to follow. With a clear understanding of what the API Mandate really means, real transformation is within any organisation\u2019s grasp.\n  Like an Arthurian legend, the memo has entered the realm of myth. Whether or not it existed in this exact form, the API Mandate was and is real at Amazon.\u00a0 \u21a9\ufe0e\n  At least in theory. I\u2019m sure some of this still happens in practice.\u00a0 \u21a9\ufe0e\n At the very least as an emblem of Amazon\u2019s systematic institutional approach to scaling its organisation.\u00a0 \u21a9\ufe0e", "posttime": "2021-06-21 10:36:31", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a,amazon,\u6388\u6743,mandate,\u4e1a\u52a1", "title": "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u7684\u201cAPI\u6388\u6743\u201d\u5907\u5fd8\u5f55 ", "title_en": "The \u201cAPI Mandate\u201d memo at Amazon", "transed": 1, "url": "https://chrislaing.net/blog/the-memo/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a", "amazon", "\u6388\u6743", "mandate", "\u4e1a\u52a1"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "b479c240b4636047d2d8410ca2e3f639.jpg", "infoid": 1067118, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters", "note_en": "4rockpuppies.comAbbie McCulloughAdam MurrayAik Rui TanAlan CainAlex HomenukeAlex VenzkeAlexis Alfonso Angulo DiazAlf LarsenAlfred PeretAllison RoebuckAmazon SmileAmy VeithAndrea IvyAndrei Constantin TinaAndrew DebnamAndr\u00e9 HeyninckAngel Roldan HerreroAnn DonnellyAnn KosterAnna KucherovaAnnalee LongAnonymousAnonymous IMO Forrest CuretonAnthea StricklandAnthony CellaAnthony GreenishAnton KutyrevArie GilatArienne BarnesArlin HowardArthur RuggieroAshley Elizabeth-Rowe PalafoxAssociation CGVYSAthanasios GiannakopoulosAutumn R TeeterAzalea LeeBARBARA ANNE AM ENDEBarb MatzBear Mountain Gold MinesBecky CoulsonBernadette GugolzBeth FischerBeth LynchBevan WardBeverly ChomiakBill CorduaBill DameronBill HamelBill and Diana Dameron IIIBlackstone River DesignBob BeattieBob CookeBoston Mineral ClubBoyd CookBranko RieckBrent LockhartBret HowardBrian KosnarBruce GellerBruce LuscombeBruce WoodBryan ConlonBuddy MorrisBuyMoldavite.comCao RuiCarl (Bob) CarneinCarmella SawyersCarmen Danilsa Martinez GarciaCaroline DieluweitCarolyn HoweCarsten Slotta / MinTreasure.comCassandra AdamsCharles BuechelCharles CauchiCharles GravesCharles KnechtelChatchaya JonesChina CollectorsChris DietzChris Whitney-SmithChrista BaumChristian AuerChristina BradburyChristina GembickiChristina JohnsonChristopher DorseyChristopher HatzimihailChristopher WentzellChristy DuncanCindi NewmanClark PetersenClaudio VivianiColorado Gem &amp; Mineral CompanyConnected CrystalsCostas ConstantinidesCourtenay SmaleCraig McKenzieCurtis FechnerC\u00e9dric SchnyderD.

", "note_en": "TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Japan&#39;s government plans to encourage firms to let their employees choose to work four days a week instead of five, aiming to improve the balance between work and life for people who have family care responsibilities or need more time off to acquire new skills.\n   The government included the promotion of an optional four-day workweek in its annual economic policy guideline finalized Friday by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga&#39;s Cabinet.\n  Experts are divided, however, on whether the new initiative, intended to address challenges posed by the country&#39;s labor shortage, will be widely accepted, with labor and management both voicing concerns about possible unwanted outcomes.\n  For employers, while people working four days a week may become more motivated, this may not improve their productivity enough to compensate for the lost workday. Employees, meanwhile, fear pay cuts.\n  Among expected advantages are helping people with family-care responsibilities avoid the need to quit their jobs, promotion of recurrent education, and helping more people take on side jobs, the government said.\n  The coronavirus pandemic has helped the idea of a four-day workweek gain traction as the health crisis causes people to spend more time at home.\n  In late April, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party recommended that the government take policy measures to facilitate adoption of the system.\n  The LDP said working fewer days is expected to promote &#34;diversified working styles&#34; and prompt workers with new skills to move to growing industries such as IT.\n  At a key economic and fiscal policy panel meeting in mid-April where the promotion of a four-day workweek was discussed, Suga said his government would consider expanding support for people willing to enhance their careers through recurrent education without leaving their jobs.\n  Among major economies, Australian, Canadian, Italian and U.S. employees work longer hours than Japanese, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development&#39;s survey. But Japan&#39;s labor market remains rigid, with productivity showing limited improvement as people take fewer holidays compared to other developed countries and labor mobility stays low.\n  According to a survey conducted on over 4,000 firms by the labor ministry last year, 8.3 percent of them were giving their employees more days off than under a five-day workweek.\n  Internet and e-commerce service giant Yahoo Japan Corp. started allowing its employees who need more time off for caregiving to take three days off a week in April 2017.\n  &#34;It has been favorably received in general, with some employees saying that it became easier to match their days off with their children&#39;s activities,&#34; a Yahoo Japan spokesman said.\n  Meanwhile, Hisashi Yamada, vice chairman of think tank Japan Research Institute, said he does not expect a four-day workweek to rapidly spread in Japan even with the government pushing it because it would complicate personnel management and evaluation.\n  &#34;Let&#39;s say, if employees take second jobs, it would be difficult for managers to know how long they work in total and to evaluate equally those who take two days off a week and those who take three. From the employees&#39; standpoint, they would not want to see their income from their main jobs decrease,&#34; said Yamada, who is well versed in labor economics issues.\n  At Yahoo Japan and many other firms offering an option of fewer workdays, extra holidays are unpaid. The Yahoo Japan spokesman said just about 100 of some 7,000 employees at the company had applied for the four-day workweek as of April. Those who want more days off for such purposes as acquiring new skills and taking side jobs are not eligible for the program, he said.\n  Japan Research&#39;s Yamada said he believes some small- and medium-sized businesses cannot afford to give such extra days off, and some businesses might try to cut labor costs by applying a four-day workweek even to employees who want to work more days.\n  &#34;It will be important for the government to draw up a framework guaranteeing a worker&#39;s right to choose whether to take three days off a week,&#34; he said.\n  Takuya Hoshino, an economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, says simply introducing a four-day workweek may not necessarily encourage employees to use their time off in a way that benefits their careers or contributes to the economy.\n  &#34;It&#39;s important for companies to make it clear what they intend in adopting such a system&#34; and provide necessary support to employees to that end, he said.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 10:36:02", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u65e5\u672c,government", "title": "\u65e5\u672c\u653f\u5e9c\u652f\u63014\u5929\u5de5\u4f5c\u5468 ", "title_en": "Japan government backs 4-day workweek", "transed": 1, "url": "https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20210619/p2g/00m/0na/014000c", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u65e5\u672c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c76b200b1998418ff7ee5608d16ece1a.jpeg", "infoid": 1067116, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5a31\u4e50\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u5a01\u65af\u5947\u7279\u7684\u5947\u8ff9\u7535\u5f71\u5b87\u5b99\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4ed6\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u65b0\u7684\u8fea\u58eb\u5c3c+\u8ba1\u5212\u4e2d\u3002\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u4ee5\u7d22\u53d6\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u827a\u672f\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u7d22\u8d54\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u6570\u51e0\u4e2a\u4e16\u7eaa\u7684\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u6765\u58f0\u79f0\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4eceRedbbble\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86Loki\u827a\u672f\u7684\u629b\u552e\u901a\u77e5\u7684\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u3002\n  Redbubble\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5141\u8bb8\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u5728\u8d34\u7eb8\uff0cT\u6064\uff0c\u5496\u5561\u676f\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u7269\u54c1\u4e0a\u9500\u552e\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u53d1\u9001\u4e86\u4e00\u5c01\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u7ed9Twitter\u7528\u6237@yourboswell\u8ba9\u4ed6\u4eec\u77e5\u9053\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e0a\u4f20\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u88ab\u4ece\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u5220\u9664\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u201c\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u8fdd\u53cd\u67d0\u4eba\u6743\u5229\u7684\u6750\u6599\u3002\u201c\n \u201c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6743\u5229\u7684\u6240\u6709\u8005\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5e94\u8be5\u4ece\u5e02\u573a\u5220\u9664\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u201d\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u7ee7\u7eed\u3002 \u201c\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u6743\u5229\u6301\u6709\u4eba\u6ca1\u6709\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc6\u522b\u60a8\u7684\u5220\u9664\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u662fRedbbble\u5728\u5220\u9664\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u548c\u6743\u5229\u6301\u6709\u4eba\u7684\u5220\u9664\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u591a\u4e2a\u5355\u8bcd\uff0c\u77ed\u8bed\u6216\u56fe\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002\u201d\n  -

", "note_en": "TL;DR A small CPU design that can come in handy, a detailed code walkthrough, a good place to start learning about both Silice and RISC-V.\n   The Ice-V is a processor that implements the  RISC-V RV32I specification. It is simple and compact (~100 lines when reduced, see image below), demonstrates many features of Silice and can be a good companion in projects. It is specialized to execute code from BRAM, where the code is baked into the BRAM upon synthesis (can be a boot loader later loading from other sources).\n It is easily hackable and would be extendable to boot from SPI, execute code from a RAM, and connect to various peripherals. The example drives LEDs and an external SPI screen.\n The version here runs out of the box on the IceStick ice40 1HK, and can adapted to other boards with minimal effort.\n      The build is performed in two steps, first compile some code for the processor to run:\n     On an IceStick the LEDs will blink around the center one in a rotating pattern.\n     Optionally you can plug a small OLED screen (I used  this one, 128x128 RGB with SSD1351 driver).\n       Note: Compling code for the processor requires a RISC-V toolchain. Under Windows, this is included in the binary package from my  fpga-binutils repo. Under macOS and Linux there are precompiled packages, or you may prefer to compile from source. See see  gettingstarted for more detailed instructions.\n   Now that we have tested the Ice-V let&#39;s dive into the code! The  entire processor fits in less than 300 lines of Silice code (~130 without comments).\n A Risc-V processor is surprisingly simple! This is also a good opportunity to discover some Silice syntax and features.\n The processor is in file  ice-v.ice. For the demos, it is included ina minimalist SOC in file  ice-v-soc.ice.\n  algorithm execute is responsible for splitting a 32 bit instruction just read from memory into information used by the rest of the processor (decoder), as well as performing all integer arithmetic (ALU): add, sub, shifts, bitwise operators, etc.\n algorithm rv32i_cpu is the main processor loop. It fetches instructions from memory, reads registers, setups the decoder and ALU with this data, performs additional memory load/stores as required, and stores results in registers.\n   We will skip everything at the beginning (we&#39;ll come back to that when needed)and focus on the infinite loop that executes instructions. It has the following structure:\n while ( 1) {   // 1. - an instruction just became available   // - setup register read++:   // wait for registers to be read (1 cycle)   // 2. - register data is available   // - trigger ALU  while ( 1) {   // decode + ALU while entering the loop (1 cycle)   // results from decoder and ALU available  if (exec. load | exec. store) {   // 4. - setup load/store RAM address   // - enable memory store?++:   // wait for memory transaction (1 cycle)   // 5. - write loaded data to register?   // - restore next instruction address  break;   // done   // next instruction read while looping back (1 cycle) }  else {   // 6. - store result of instruction in register   // - setup next instruction address  if (exec. working ==  0) {   // ALU done?  break;   // done   // next instruction read while looping back (1 cycle) } } }}\n The loop structure is constructed such that most instructions take three cycles, with load/store requiring an additional cycle. It also allows to wait for the ALU which sometimes needs multiple cycles (shifts proceed one bit per cycle).Silice  has precise rules on how cycles are used in control flow (while/break/if/else), which allows us to write the loop so that no cycles are wasted.\n  Let&#39;s go through this step by step. The first  while (1) is the main processor loop. At the start of the iteration (marker  1. above) an instruction is available from memory, either from the boot address at startup, or from the previous iteration setup.We first copy the data read from memory into a local  instr variable, so that weare free to do other memory transactions. We also copy the memory address from whichthe instruction came in a variable called  pc for  program counter.\n   Storing the instruction in  instr will also update the values read from the registers.That is done in the  always_after block, which specifies things to be done  every cycleand  after everything else. The  always_after block contains these two linessetting up register read from  instr:\n // vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv ignore for nowxregsA.addr =   /* xregsA.wenable ? exec.write_rd :  */ Rtype(instr).rs1;xregsB.addr =   /* xregsA.wenable ? exec.write_rd :  */ Rtype(instr).rs2;\n The registers are stored in two BRAMs,  xregsA and  xregsB. By setting their addr field we known that the values of the registers will be in their  rdatafield  at the next clock cycle. That is the reason we wait for one cycle witha  ++: after marker  1.\n  // bitfield for easier decoding of instructionsbitfield Rtype { uint1 unused1, uint1 sign, uint5 unused2, uint5 rs2, uint5 rs1, uint3 op, uint5 rd, uint7 opcode}\n Writing  Rtype(instr).rs1 is the same as  instr[15,5] (5 bits width from bit 15), but in aneasier to read/modify format.\n The reason we use two BRAMs is to be able to read two registers in a single cycle.So these two BRAMs always contain the same values, but can be read independently.\n    xregsA and  xregsB are always written to together, so they hold the same values.This is also done in the  always_after block:\n // write back data to both register BRAMsxregsA.wdata = write_back; xregsB.wdata = write_back;   // xregsB written when xregsA isxregsB.wenable = xregsA.wenable;   // write to write_rd, else track instruction registerxregsA.addr = xregsA.wenable ? exec.write_rd : Rtype(instr).rs1;xregsB.addr = xregsA.wenable ? exec.write_rd : Rtype(instr).rs2;\n Both BRAM  wdata field are set to the same  write_back value and  xregsB.wenable tracks xregsA.wenable. Finally, when their field  wenabled = 1 they both write to thesame  addr given by  exec.write_rd. This ensures both BRAMs always containthe same values.\n  After this setup, we wait for one cycle ( ++:) for the register values to be available at the BRAM outputs. Once the register values are available (marker  2.), the decoder and ALU will start refreshing from these updated values. Both decoder and ALU are grouped in the secondalgorithm called  execute. The outputs of  execute are accessed with the &#39;dot&#39;syntax:  exec.name_of_output.\n  // decoder + ALU, executes the instruction and tells processor what to doexecute  exec( instr &lt;:: instr, pc &lt;:: pc, xa &lt;: xregsA.rdata, xb &lt;: xregsB.rdata);\n The algorithm receives the instruction  instr, the program counter  pc, theregister values  xregsA.rdata and  xregsB.rdata. These are  bound to thealgorithm&#39;s inputs with the wiring operators  &lt;:: and  &lt;: . There is an importantdistinction between both related to timing. Operator  &lt;:: means that the variable is wired suchthat the instantiated algorithm  execute sees its value  before it is changedby the host algorithm  rv32i_cpu during the cycle. Therefore  execute does notimmediately see the change when both  instr and  pc are assigned at marker  1.,but onlys see the change at the next cycle (after the  ++:). This creates a onecycle latency, but also makes the circuit shorter leading to an increased maxfrequency for the design. These are important tradeoffs to play with in your designs.\n Back to marker  2., as soon as the register data is available information flowsthrough  execute and we have nothing specific to do. However, the ALU part of  executeneeds to be told it should trigger its computations at this specific cycle:\n  For all details on the (important!) topic of algorithm bindings and timings  please refer to the dedicated page.\n  Then we enter a second  while(1) loop. In many cases we will break out of this second loop after just one cycle, but sometimes the ALU needs to work over multiple cycles, so the loop allows to wait. Entering a loop takes one cycle, so while we enter the loop data flows through  execute and its outputs are ready when we are in the loop.\n In the loop we distinguish two cases: either a load/store has to be performed  if (exec.load | exec.store) or else another instruction is running. Let&#39;s first consider the second case (marker  6.). A non load/store instruction ran through the decoder and ALU.\n  First, we consider writing the instruction result to a register. This is done with the following code:\n  Recall  xregsA is a BRAM holding register values. Its  wenable field indicates whether we write (1) or read (0). Here, it will be enabled if the decoder output  exec.no_rd is low. But that seems a bit short? For instance where do we tell  what to write?This is in fact done in the  always_after block, as we have seen earlier (see  Registers section above). The data to be written is set with:\n  This explains why we don&#39;t need to set it again when writing the result of the instruction to the register.\n But why do that? Why not simply write this code in  6. alongside the rest? This is for efficiency, both in terms of circuit size and frequency. If the assignment was in  6. a more complex circuit would be generated to ensure it is only done in this specific state. This would require a more complex multiplexer circuit, and therefore it is best to always blindly set this value in the  always_after block. As long as we do not set  xregsA.wenable = 1 nothing gets written anyway. This is a very important aspect of efficient hardware design, and by carefully avoiding uncessary conditions your designs will be made much more efficient. Please also refer to  Silice design guidelines.\n  // what do we write in register? (pc, alu or val, load is handled separately)  // &#39;or trick&#39; from femtorv32int32 write_back &lt;: (exec.jump ? (next_pc&lt;&lt; 2) : 32b0) | (exec.storeAddr ? exec.n[ 0,$addrW+ 2$] : 32b0) | (exec.storeVal ? exec.val : 32b0) | (exec.load ? loaded : 32b0) | (exec.intop ? exec.r : 32b0);\n write_back &lt;: ... defines an expression tracker: the read-only variable  write_backis an alias to the expression given in its definition (a  wire in Verilog terms). write_back gives the value to write back based on the decoder outputs. exec.storeAddr indicates to write back the address computed by the ALU in  exec.n (AUIPC). exec.storeVal indicates to write back the value  exec.val from the decoder (LUI or RDCYCLE). exec.jump indicates to write back  next_pc&lt;&lt;2 (JAL, JALR, conditional branches taken). The shift transform 32-bits instruction pointer into byte addresses.\n Alright! the register is updated. Back to marker  6. Next we set the address of the next instruction to fetch and execute:\n  This is either the address computed from the ALU in case of a jump/branchas indicated by  exec.jump, or the value of  next_pc which is simply  pc + 1:the instruction following the current one.\n Almost done, but first we have to check whether the ALU is not in a multi-cycleoperations.This is why we only break  if (exec.working == 0).If not, the loop iterates again, waiting for the ALU.Note that  6. will be visited again, so we&#39;ll write again to the register. And yes, if theALU is not yet done the write we did before might be an incorrect value. But that isall fine: the result will be correct at the last iteration, and it costs us nothingto do these writes. In fact  it costs us less because not doing them would againrequire more multiplexer circuitry!\n After we break, it takes one cycle to go back to the start of the loop. During thiscycle the next instruction is read from  mem and the result (if any) is written tothe register in  xregsA.\n You may have noticed that we wrote the next address in  wide_addr while thememory interface is  mem, so we should have written to  mem.addr? This is to allowthe SOC to see a wider address bus and perform memory mapping. The address we setin  wide_addr is assigned to  mem.addr in the  always_after block, that isapplied at the end of every cycle:  mem.addr = wide_addr. It is also outputfrom the algorithm to the SOC:  output! uint12 wide_addr(0) where  output! meansthe SOC immediately see changes to  wide_addr.\n  That&#39;s it for non load/store instructions. Now let us go back to  if (exec.load | exec.store)and see how a load/store is handled. Because the Ice-V is specialized for BRAM, weknow all memory transactions take a single cycle. While we&#39;ll have to accountfor this cycle, this is a big luxury compared to having to wait for an unknownnumber of cycles an external memory controller.\n When reaching marker  .4 we first setup the address of the load/store. This addresscomes from the ALU:\n  The sift by two is due to the fact that computed addresses are in bytes, whilethe memory interface addresses are in 32-bits words.\n Then, this is either a store or a load. If that is a store, we need to enablewriting to memory. The memory is called  mem and is a BRAM, given to the CPU:  algorithm rv32i_cpu( bram_port mem, ... ). The BRAM holds 32 bits words at each address.To enable writing we set its  wenable member. However this BRAM has a specificity:it allows a write mask. So  wenable is not a single bit, but four bits, whichallows to selectively write any of the four bytes at each memory address.\n And we need that! The RISC-V RV32I specification features load/store for bytes,16-bits and 32-bits words. That means that depending on the instruction (SB/SH/SW)we need to setup the write mask appropriately. This is done with this code:\n // == Store (enabled below if exec.store == 1)  // build write mask depending on SB, SH, SWmem.wenable = ({ 4{exec. store}} &amp; { {  2{exec. op[ 0, 2]==2b10} }, exec. op[ 0, 1] | exec. op[ 1, 1], 1b1 } ) &lt;&lt; exec.n[ 0, 2];\n That might seem a bit cryptic but what this does is to produces a write mask of the form  4b0001, 4b0010, 4b0100, 4b1000 (SB) or  4b0011, 4b1100 (SH) or  4b1111 (SW) depending on  exec.op[0,2] (load type) and  exec.n[0,2] (address lowest bits).As this may not be a store after all, an AND between the mask and  exec.store isapplied. The syntax  {4{exec.store}} means that the bit  exec.store is replicatedfour times to obtain a  uint4.\n Next we wait one cycle for the memory transaction to occur in BRAM with  ++:. Ifthat was a store we just wrote and we are done when we reach marker  5.\n If that was a load we just read from memory and now have to store the resultin the selected register. This is done by this code:\n  This is enough to trigger the register update, since  xregsA.wdata and xregsA.addr are properly set up afterwards in the  always_after block where wdata is assigned  write_back.Recall that  write_back selects  loaded when  exec.load is high (seedefinition of  write_back above).  loaded is defined as follows:\n // decodes values loaded from memory (used when exec.load == 1)uint32 aligned &lt;: mem.rdata &gt;&gt; {exec. n[ 0, 2],3b000}; switch ( exec.op[ 0, 2] ) {   // LB / LBU, LH / LHU, LW  case 2b00:{ loaded = {{ 24{(~exec. op[ 2, 1])&amp;aligned[  7, 1]}},aligned[  0, 8]}; }  case 2b01:{ loaded = {{ 16{(~exec. op[ 2, 1])&amp;aligned[ 15, 1]}},aligned[  0, 16]};}  case 2b10:{ loaded = aligned; }  default: { loaded = { 32{1bx}}; }   // don&#39;t care (does not occur)}\n This selects the loaded value depending of whether a byte (LB/LBU), 16-bits (LH/LHU) or 32-bits (LW) were accessed (U indicates unsigned).  mem.rdata is the value right out of memory, andit is shifted in  aligned to be the part selected by the address lowest bits  exec.n[0,2].\n Note that  {exec.n[0,2],3b000} is simply  exec.n[0,2] &lt;&lt; 3 (a left shift by three bits is equivalent to concatenating three 0 bits to the right).\n After the load/store is completed we restore the next instruction address  next_pc,so that the processor is ready to proceed with the next iteration after the break:\n  And that&#39;s it! We have seen the entire processor logic. Let&#39;s now dive into someof the other components.\n  The decoder is part of  algorithm execute. It is a relatively straightforward affair.It starts by decoding allthe possible  immediate values -- these are constants encoded in the differenttypes of instructions:\n // decode immediatesint32 imm_u &lt;: {instr[ 12, 20],12b0};int32 imm_j &lt;: {{ 12{instr[ 31, 1]}},instr[ 12, 8],instr[ 20, 1],instr[ 21, 10],1b0};int32 imm_i &lt;: {{ 20{instr[ 31, 1]}},instr[ 20, 12]};int32 imm_b &lt;: {{ 20{instr[ 31, 1]}},instr[ 7, 1],instr[ 25, 6],instr[ 8, 4],1b0};int32 imm_s &lt;: {{ 20{instr[ 31, 1]}},instr[ 25, 7],instr[ 7, 5]};\n These values are only used when the matching instruction executes. For instance imm_i is used in register-immediate integer operations.\n  uint5 opcode &lt;: instr[  2,  5];uint1 AUIPC &lt;: opcode == 5b00101; uint1 LUI &lt;: opcode == 5b01101;uint1 JAL &lt;: opcode == 5b11011; uint1 JALR &lt;: opcode == 5b11001;uint1 IntImm &lt;: opcode == 5b00100; uint1 IntReg &lt;: opcode == 5b01100;uint1 Cycles &lt;: opcode == 5b11100; uint1 branch &lt;: opcode == 5b11000;\n These are of course mutually-exclusive, so only one of these is  1 at a givencycle.\n Finally we set the decoder outputs, telling the processor what to do with the instruction.\n // ==== set decoder outputs depending on incoming instructions  // load/store?load := opcode == 5b00000; store := opcode == 5b01000;   // operator for load/store // register to write to?op := Rtype(instr).op; write_rd := Rtype(instr).rd;   // do we have to write a result to a register?no_rd := branch | store | (Rtype(instr).rd == 5b0);  // integer operations // store next address?intop := (IntImm | IntReg); storeAddr := AUIPC;   // value to store directly // store value?val := LUI ? imm_u : cycle; storeVal := LUI | Cycles;\n The  always assign operator  := used on outputs means thatthe output is set to this value first thing every cycle (this is a shortcutequivalent to a normal assignment  = in an  always_before block).\n For instance  write_rd := Rtype(instr).rd is the index of the destinationregister for the instruction, while  no_rd := branch | store | (Rtype(instr).rd == 5b0)indicates whether the write to the register is enabled or not.\n Note the condition  Rtype(instr).rd == 5b0 in  no_rd. That is becauseregister zero, as per the RISC-V spec, should always remain zero.\n  The ALU performs all integer computations. It consists of three parts. Theinteger operations such as ADD, SUB, SLLI, SRLI, AND, XOR (output  r) ;the comparator for conditional branches (output  jump) ; the next address adder (output  n).\n Due to the way the data flow is setup we can use a nice trick. The ALU as wellas the comparator select two integers for their operations. The setup of the Ice-Vis such that both can input the same integers, so they can share the same circuitsto perform similar operations. And what is common to  &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=? Theycan all be done with a single subtraction! This trick is implemented as follows:\n // ==== allows to do subtraction and all comparisons with a single adder  // trick from femtorv32/swapforth/J1int33 a_minus_b &lt;: {1b1,~b} + {1b0,xa} + 33b1;uint1 a_lt_b &lt;: (xa[ 31, 1] ^ b[ 31, 1]) ? xa[ 31, 1] : a_minus_b[ 32, 1];uint1 a_lt_b_u &lt;: a_minus_b[ 32, 1];uint1 a_eq_b &lt;: a_minus_b[ 0, 32] ==  0;\n xa is the first register, while  b is selected before based on results from the decoder:\n     // ==== select next address adder first inputint32 addr_a &lt;: pcOrReg ? __signed({pc[ 0,$addrW- 2$],2b0}) : xa;\n For instance, instructions  AUIPC, JAL and  branch will select the programcounter  pc for  addr_a as can be seen in the decoder:\n  The second value in the next address computation is an immediate selected basedon the running instruction:\n // ==== select immediate for the next address computationint32 addr_imm &lt;: (AUIPC ? imm_u : 32b0) | (JAL ? imm_j : 32b0) | (branch ? imm_b : 32b0) | ((JALR|load) ? imm_i : 32b0) | (store ? imm_s : 32b0);\n The next address is then simply the sum of  addr\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-21 09:43:46", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News",

the billionaire real estate mogul and former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, is pouring $100 million into an attempt to rebuild the\u00a0foundations of social media. The effort, which he has loftily named Project Liberty, centers on the construction of a publicly accessible database of people\u2019s social connections, allowing users to move records of their relationships between social media services instead of being locked into a few dominant apps.\n    The undercurrent to Project Liberty is a fear of the power that a few huge companies \u2014 and specifically\u00a0Facebook Inc.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0have amassed over the last decade. \u201cI never thought I would be questioning the security of our underlying systems, namely democracy and capitalism,\u201d McCourt said. \u201cWe live under constant surveillance, and what\u2019s happening with this massive accumulation of wealth and power in the hands of a few, that\u2019s incredibly destabilizing. It threatens capitalism because capitalism needs to have some form of fairness in it in order to survive.\u201d\n McCourt is hardly the only one to feel this way. Others are trying to reform social media by passing new laws or regulations, waiting for the next generation of startups to disrupt the current incumbents, or pressuring Facebook to look inward and revise its business model. McCourt, along with others like Twitter Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey, say the solution may be blockchain, the technology underpinning bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n Project Liberty would use blockchain\u00a0to construct a new internet infrastructure called the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol. With cryptocurrencies, blockchain stores information about the tokens in everyone\u2019s digital wallets; the DSNP would do the same for social connections. Facebook owns the data about the social connections between its users, giving it an enormous advantage over competitors. If all social media companies drew from a common social graph, the theory goes, they\u2019d have to compete by offering better services, and the chance of any single company becoming so dominant would plummet.\n Building DSNP falls to Braxton Woodham, the co-founder of the meal delivery service Sun Basket and former chief technology officer of Fandango, the movie ticket website. Woodham had been toying with the idea of building something like DSNP, but didn\u2019t imagine anyone would be interested in investing in it. When he mulled the idea over with McCourt, he says, \u201cI just thought we were talking about our daydreams, I didn\u2019t think it was something we\u2019d actually do.\u201d\n Instead, McCourt hired Woodham to build the protocol, and pledged to put $75 million into an\u00a0institute at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., and Sciences Po in Paris to research technology that serves the common good. The rest of his $100 million will go toward\u00a0pushing entrepreneurs to build services that utilize the DSNP.\u00a0McCourt calls this his third attempt to fix social media, after previously investing in tech companies he thought would help transform the way people interact online. His previous attempts convinced him that entrepreneurs must\u00a0be supported by academic thinkers exploring the industry\u2019s biggest ethical questions.\n  The blockchain protocol idea echoes a project Dorsey has been pushing at Twitter called Bluesky. Dorsey has been at the center of the fight over how companies like his should police their users. He said after Twitter banned former President Donald Trump that a blockchain-based social graph would reduce the stakes when\u00a0private companies make user decisions.\u00a0\u201cThe reason I have so much passion for Bitcoin is largely because of the model it demonstrates: a foundational internet technology that is not controlled or influenced by any single individual or entity,\u201d Dorsey tweeted on Jan. 13. \u201cThis is what the internet wants to be, and over time, more of it will be.\u201d\n       While the power of social media companies makes many people uneasy, critics also accuse them of not wielding their power effectively, allowing for abusive behavior.\u00a0A decentralized approach to social media could actually undermine the power of content moderation,\u00a0by making it easier for users who are kicked off one platform to simply migrate their audiences to more permissive ones. McCourt and Woodham say blockchain could discourage bad behavior because people would be tied to their posts forever.\n Before Project Liberty grapples with such problems it has to worry about attracting enough people to matter. The current way of doing things is deeply entrenched, and Project Liberty is proposing that the entire internet start doing things\u00a0drastically differently.\u00a0 Eventually, the group plans to\u00a0create its own consumer product on top of the DSNP infrastructure, and wrote in a press release that the eventual result will be an \u201copen, inclusive data economy where individuals own, control and derive greater social and economic value from their personal information.\u201d\n McCourt also believes that recent history has underscored the disfunction of the current system, punctuated by the misinformation-fueled riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan.\u00a06.\u00a0What do social media users really\u00a0have to lose? \u201cLook at the cesspool that\u2019s been created,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at the reality that the internet has become.\u201d\n  Microsoft and partners may be compensated if you purchase something through recommended links in this article.\n                Opens in a new window  Opens an external site  Opens an external site in a new window", "posttime": "2021-06-21 09:01:30", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u533a\u5757\u94fe,\u793e\u4ea4,mogul", "title": "\u623f\u5730\u4ea7Mogul\u5c06\u4f7f\u75281\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u6765\u4f7f\u7528\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6765\u4fee\u590d\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53 ", "title_en": "A Real Estate Mogul Will Spend $100 Million to Fix Social Media Using Blockchain", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/a-real-estate-mogul-has-a-dollar100-million-plan-to-save-the-internet/ar-AALfdW1", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u533a\u5757\u94fe", "\u793e\u4ea4", "mogul"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f9e875478a46c0c63032e3ad14e54496.png", "infoid": 1067112, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\n\u5728\u8fd1\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u56fa\u4f53\u8102\u59dc\u9ec4\u7d20\u9897\u7c92\uff08SLCP\uff09\u5236\u5242\u5728\u6025\u6027\u548c\u4e9a\u6162\u6027\u65bd\u7528\u540e\u5728\u5927\u9f20\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u826f\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff08Dadhaniya\u7b49\uff0c\uff09\u3002 \u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u9f20\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c0f\u9f20\u4e2d\u7684\u5236\u5242\u7684\u53e3\u670dLD 50\u5927\u4e8e2000mg\u00b7kg -1\u4f53\u91cd\u3002 \u5728\u4e9a\u6162\u6027\u6bd2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53e3\u670d\u9972\u517b\u5230W\uff0c\u5c06180,360\u548c720mg\u00b7Kg -1\u4f53\u91cd\u7b2c1\u5929-1\u8fdb\u884cSLCP\u5236\u5242\u7ed9\u4e88  ...... ", "note_en": "TNFs are major mediators of inflammation and inflammation-related diseases, hence, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of blockers of the cytokine, TNF-\u03b1, for the treatment of osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and ankylosis. These drugs include the chimeric TNF antibody (infliximab), humanized TNF-\u03b1 antibody (Humira) and soluble TNF receptor-II (Enbrel) and are associated with a total cumulative market value of more than $20 billion a year. As well as being expensive ($15 000\u201320 000 per person per year), these drugs have to be injected and have enough adverse effects to be given a black label warning by the FDA. In the current report, we describe an alternative, curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a component of turmeric ( Curcuma longa) that is very inexpensive, orally bioavailable and highly safe in humans, yet can block TNF-\u03b1 action and production in  in vitro models, in animal models and in humans. In addition, we provide evidence for curcumin&#39;s activities against all of the diseases for which TNF blockers are currently being used. Mechanisms by which curcumin inhibits the production and the cell signalling pathways activated by this cytokine are also discussed. With health-care costs and safety being major issues today, this golden spice may help provide the solution.\n This article is part of a themed section on Emerging Therapeutic Aspects in Oncology. To view the other articles in this section visit  http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bph.2013.169.issue-8\n Extensive research during the past century has revealed that inflammation plays a major role in most chronic diseases. It was Cornelius Celsus, a physician in first century Rome, who first attempted to describe inflammation as heat (calor), pain (dolor), redness (rubor) and swelling (tumour). Rudolf Virchow, a German scientist from Wurzburg, in 1850, was the first to observe a link between inflammation and various chronic diseases, which include cancer, atherosclerosis, arthritis, diabetes, asthma, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer&#39;s disease (Heidland  et al.,  ). More than 200 different types of inflammatory disease have been described. When the name of a disease ends with \u2018itis\u2019, this means inflammation of the affected organ. Thus, arthritis is inflammation of the joints, whereas bronchitis, sinusitis, gastritis, oesophagitis, pancreatitis, meningitis, rhinitis and gingivitis are, respectively, inflammation of the bronchi, sinuses, stomach, oesophagus, pancreas, brain, nose and gums. Acute inflammation is thought to be therapeutic as it helps an organism to heal. Chronic inflammation, however, can lead to a disease; inflammation of the colon (colitis), for example, when persistant, for as long as 30 years, can finally lead to colon cancer.\n During the past three decades, molecular mechanisms that lead to inflammation have been extensively examined. Various enzymes, cytokines, chemokines and polypeptide hormones have been identified, which can mediate inflammation. These include COX-2, 5-lipooxygenase (LOX), TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, Il-17, IL-21, IL-23 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). Among these, TNF-\u03b1 is a major mediator of inflammation, which is the primary focus of this review.\n TNF has at various times been called  tumour necrosis serum,  cachectin,  lymphotoxin or  monocyte cytotoxin based on work from our laboratory and others. It is now clear that TNF is a 25 kDa transmembrane protein (17 kDa when secreted) produced primarily by activated macrophages. The ability of tumours to undergo haemorrhagic necrosis after injection of endotoxin was first shown by Shear and Perrault ( 1944). O&#39;Malley  et al. ( ) reported that endotoxin injection into normal mice resulted in the appearance of tumour necrotizing activity in the circulating blood. This activity was renamed  tumour necrosis factor by Carswell  et al. ( ). The true chemical identity of TNF, however, was unclear until our group isolated two different molecules: one from macrophages, which we named TNF-\u03b1 (Aggarwal  et al.,  ), and the other from lymphocytes, which we named TNF-\u03b2 (Aggarwal  et al.,  ). The current review primarily deals with TNF-\u03b1.\n Because of the amino acid sequence homology between human TNF-\u03b1 and endotoxin-induced murine cachectin, a protein linked to endotoxin-mediated cachexia and shock (Beutler  et al.,  ), it became clear that TNF-\u03b1 and cachectin were identical. Soon thereafter, numerous groups independently identified the same molecule by using a variety of approaches (Haranaka  et al.,  ; Old,  ; Wang  et al.,  ; Fiers  et al.,  ; Wallach,  ). TNF-\u03b1 is now known to bind to two different receptors, TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B, and to activate caspase-mediated apoptosis, NF-\u03baB, activator protein-1 (AP-1), JNK, p38 MAPK and ERK signalling (  Figure 1). Our group demonstrated that both TNF-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b2 bind to identical receptors and with similar affinities (Aggarwal  et al.,  ). Although much is known about TNF-\u03b1, very little is understood about TNF-\u03b2 (Aggarwal,  ; Aggarwal  et al.,  ). Both overlapping and non-overlapping activities of the two molecules have been reviewed (Stone-Wolff  et al.,  ; Kuprash  et al.,  ; Liepinsh  et al.,  ).\n  Aside from originating in monocytes, it is now clear that TNF-\u03b1 is also produced by a variety of other cell types including Kupffer cells in the liver, astrocytes in the brain, T-cells and beta cells in the immune system, and ovarian cells. In general, under appropriate conditions, most cell types have the potential to produce TNF-\u03b1.\n It is only within the past few decades that the mechanisms by which inflammation is mediated at the molecular level have become apparent. Although the role of macrophages in inflammation has been known for quite some time, the first indication of the pro-inflammatory activity of TNF emerged in 1985 when it was found to stimulate collagenase and PGE 2 production by isolated human synovial cells and dermal fibroblasts (Dayer  et al.,  ; Caput  et al.,  ), thus suggesting that TNF may play a role in the tissue destruction and remodelling associated with inflammatory diseases.\n TNF dysregulation has been linked to a wide variety of diseases including cancer, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, psychological diseases, skin diseases and autoimmune diseases (Aggarwal,  ; Aggarwal  et al.,  ). Thus, blockers of TNF have been approved for the treatment of various autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn&#39;s disease (CD), psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa and refractory asthma. The inhibition of TNF can be achieved with monoclonal antibodies such as infliximab (Remicade; Janssen Biotech Inc., Horsham, PA, USA), adalimumab (Humira; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL, USA), certolizumab pegol (Cimzia; UCB, Brussels, Belgium) and golimumab (Simponi; Janssen Biotech) or with a circulating receptor fusion protein such as etanercept (Enbrel; Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA). Their potential use in other pro-inflammatory diseases is currently being explored. Some of the important adverse effects most extensively associated with TNF blockers include lymphoma, infections, congestive heart failure, demyelinating disease, a lupus-like syndrome, induction of auto-antibodies, injection site reactions and systemic adverse effects (Scheinfeld,  ).\n Numerous reports have suggested that the production of TNF from macrophages activated by various stimuli can be suppressed by curcumin (  Table 1). Studies have supported findings that LPS is one of the major inducers of TNF-\u03b1 in macrophages and monocytes and that curcumin can down-regulate the expression of TNF-\u03b1 (Chan,  ; Abe  et al.,  ; Jang  et al.,  ; Gao  et al.,  ; Strasser  et al.,  ; Woo  et al.,  ; Liang  et al.,  ;  ; Cheung  et al.,  ; Jain  et al.,  ; Nishida  et al.,  ; Zhao  et al.,  ). Besides being expressed by myeloid cells, TNF is also expressed by microglial cells, adipocytes and other cell types. Curcumin, however, has been shown to down-regulate TNF expression (Jin  et al.,  ; Lee  et al.,  ; Zhang  et al.,  ;  ). In addition to being induced by LPS, TNF is also upregulated by a variety of other stimuli including phorbol ester, palmitate and other inflammatory cytokines, and curcumin has been shown to block the expression of TNF induced by all of these stimuli (Abe  et al.,  ; Lee  et al.,  ; Jain  et al.,  ; Wang  et al.,  ).\n AKT, AKT8 virus oncogene cellular homologue; AP-1, activator protein-1; HO-1, haeme oxygenase-1; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; MCP-1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1; MIP-1\u03b1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1; MMP-9, matrix metallopeptidase-9; NQO1, NADH quinone oxidoreductase 1; TRPC1, transient receptor potential channel 1; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1.\n How curcumin down-regulates TNF expression in different cell types and in response to a variety of stimuli has been examined extensively. TNF suppression primarily occurs at the transcriptional level. The factors known to be involved in TNF transcription include the transcription factor ETS (Kramer  et al.,  ), activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2)/Jun (Leitman  et al.,  ; Newell  et al.,  ; Tsai  et al.,  , ), Sp1 (Kramer  et al.,  ), nuclear factor of activated T-cell transcription factor (NFAT) (McCaffrey  et al.,  ; Tsai  et al.,  , ), NF-\u03baB (Udalova  et al.,  ; Kuprash  et al.,  ), early growth response protein-1 (Kramer  et al.,  ), cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) (Geist  et al.,  ), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein \u03b2 (C/EBP\u03b2) (Pope  et al.,  ; Wedel  et al.,  ; Zagariya  et al.,  ), NF-E2-related factor 1 (Novotny  et al.,  ; Prieschl  et al.,  ) and LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 factor (LITAF) (Takashiba  et al.,  ; Myokai  et al.,  ) (  Figure 1). Hence, different transcription factors appear to be involved in the stimulation of TNF expression by various stimuli and in different cell types. For instance, the transcription factor LITAF is involved in LPS-stimulated TNF expression. Whereas ATF2/Jun and NFATp are involved in TNF expression in activated beta and T-cells, C/EBP\u03b2 is involved in human monocytes. Several of these transcription factors have been shown to be modulated by curcumin.\n Curcumin can mediate its effect on TNF expression by inhibiting p300/CREB-specific acetyl transferase, leading to repression of the acetylation of histone/non-histone proteins and histone acetyl transferase-dependent chromatin transcription (Balasubramanyam  et al.,  ). It is also well known that curcumin can down-modulate the activation of NF-\u03baB by a variety of agents (Singh and Aggarwal,  ) and this down-regulation of NF-\u03baB by curcumin plays a major role in suppressing the expression of TNF. In addition, in a number of studies it has been shown that methylation of a TNF promoter may affect the promoter&#39;s function (Kochanek  et al.,  ;  ; Muiznieks and Doerfler,  ; Takei  et al.,  ). Thus, curcumin could affect TNF expression by affecting the methylation of a TNF promoter (Reuter  et al.,  ).\n It is possible that the effects of curcumin on LPS-induced TNF production are mediated in part through its LPS signalling. Two of the toll-like receptors (TLRs), TLR2 and TLR4, mediate responsiveness to LPS. LPS-mediated TLR2 mRNA induction has been shown to be attenuated by pretreatment with curcumin (Matsuguchi  et al.,  ). In addition, there is biochemical evidence indicating that curcumin can inhibit both ligand-induced and ligand-independent dimerization of TLR4 (Youn  et al.,  ). The beneficial effect of curcumin is partly mediated by reducing the expression levels of TNF through inhibition of the expression of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 in mouse liver (Tu  et al.,  ). Curcumin also binds with sub-micromolar affinity to the myeloid differentiation protein-2 (MD-2), which is the LPS-binding component of the endotoxin surface receptor complex MD-2/TLR4 (Gradisar  et al.,  ). The binding site for curcumin overlaps with that of LPS; this results in the inhibition of MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent signalling pathways of LPS signalling through TLR4, indicating that MD-2 is an important target of curcumin involved in its suppression of the innate immune response to bacterial infection.\n There are numerous reports suggesting that curcumin can not only block the production of TNF but also block the cell signalling mediated by TNF in a variety of cell types (  Table 1). Our group was the first to show that curcumin can inhibit TNF-mediated NF-\u03baB action in variety of cell types (Singh and Aggarwal,  ). We also showed that TNF-mediated expression of various cell surface adhesion molecules in endothelial cells is down-regulated by curcumin (Kumar  et al.,  ). Since then, a wide variety of cell signalling pathways activated by TNF have been shown to be down-regulated by curcumin; these include JNK, MAPK, PI3K/Akt.\n In addition, curcumin has also been shown to modulate TNF-\u03b1 function by directly binding to the ligand (Gupta  et al.,  ). Wua  et al. ( 2010) performed molecular docking studies with TNF-\u03b1 and curcumin to predict and analyse the ability of curcumin to inhibit TNF-\u03b1 by binding to it. The protein\u2013ligand interactions were analysed by simulating the docking of the curcumin using Autodock 4.0. They identified three main binding regions for curcumin and found that curcumin is a potent inhibitor of TNF-\u03b1. They also observed that curcumin docked at the receptor-binding sites of TNF-\u03b1. Covalent \u03c0-\u03c0 aromatic interactions or \u03c0\u2013cation interactions were found between curcumin and TNF-\u03b1. The authors predicted that curcumin is a strong inhibitor of TNF-\u03b1 because of the covalent bonds it forms with Cys 129 in TNF-\u03b1. In contrast to its interaction with TNF-\u03b1, it is unclear whether curcumin can interact or affect the expression of TNF-\u03b2 or lymphotoxin.\n The anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin was first demonstrated in acute and chronic models of inflammation in rats and mice (Srimal and Dhawan,  ). The authors showed that curcumin (50\u2013200 mg\u00b7kg \u22121) suppressed carrageenan-induced oedema in mice. Furthermore, curcumin was found to be as potent as phenylbutazone and exhibited minimal ulcerogenic activity. No mortality in mice was noted at doses as high as 2 g\u00b7kg \u22121 bodyweight (Srimal and Dhawan,  ). In the same study, the authors showed that curcumin suppresses formaldehyde-induced arthritis in rats at a dose of 40 mg\u00b7kg \u22121 and inhibited granuloma formation at 80\u2013160 mg\u00b7kg \u22121. However, the mechanism by which curcumin mediates these anti-inflammatory effects in animals was not revealed until several years later, when our group showed that curcumin can suppress TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation (Singh and Aggarwal,  ) and other groups showed that curcumin blocked TNF production in cell culture (Chan,  ) and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (Jobin  et al.,  ). Since then, numerous mechanisms by which curcumin can exhibit anti-inflammatory activity have been proposed (  Figures 1 and   \u200b and2 2).\n  Numerous reports have been published suggesting that oral administration of curcumin down-regulates TNF-\u03b1 expression both in the serum and in the tissue of animals (Nanji  et al.,  ; Yao  et al.,  ; Sharma  et al.,  ; Billerey-Larmonier  et al.,  ; Larmonier  et al.,  ; Ung  et al.,  ; El-Moselhy  et al.,  ; Gutierres  et al.,  ) (  Table 2). Attenuation of TNF-\u03b1 levels by curcumin has been noted in mice (Leyon and Kuttan,  ), rats (Siddiqui  et al.,  ) and rabbits (Yao  et al.,  ; Huang  et al.,  ). A dose of curcumin of 50\u2013500 mg\u00b7kg \u22121\u00b7day \u22121 was used for most of these studies. Endotoxin has been shown to induce septic shock in animals, in part, through the production of TNF, and this condition has been shown to be reversed by curcumin (Siddiqui  et al.,  ; Chen  et al.,  ;  ; Huang  et al.,  ; Nishida  et al.,  ). Decreased TNF-\u03b1 levels have also been noted in tumour-bearing animals treated with this polyphenol (Leyon and Kuttan,  ). In addition to cancer, down-regulation of TNF-\u03b1 by curcumin has been associated with protection from various pro-inflammatory diseases, including sub-chronic inflammation (Nandal  et al.,  ; Nishida  et al.,  ), cardiovascular diseases (Yao  et al.,  ;  ; Mito  et al.,  ; Avci  et al.,  ), diabetes (Jain  et al.,  ; El-Azab  et al.,  ; El-Moselhy  et al.,  ), acute pancreatitis (Gulcubuk  et al.,  ), enterocolitis (Jia  et al.,  ), enteritis (Song  et al.,  ), prostatitis (Zhang  et al.,  ), diabetic neuropathy (Sharma  et al.,  ), hepatic injury (Yun  et al.,  ), Th1-type ileitis (Bereswill  et al.,  ), hepatic fibrosis (Shu  et al.,  ; Zeng  et al.,  ), radiation-induced lung fibrosis (Lee  et al.,  ), asthma (Ammar el  et al.,  ), alcohol-induced liver disease (Nanji  et al.,  ), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (Ramirez-Tortosa  et al.,  ), concanavalin A-induced liver injury (Tu  et al.,  ), renal injury (Hashem  et al.,  ; Pan  et al.,  ), infection (Allam,  ), fatigue (Gupta  et al.,  ), bone turnover (Yang  et al.,  ) and high-fat diet-induced hyperglycaemia (El-Moselhy  et al.,  ). Curcumin has also been found to down-regulate NF-\u03baB-regulated gene products such as inducible NOS (iNOS), IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in animals (Yao  et al.,  ; Yeh  et al.,  ; Jain  et al.,  ). Curcumin also protects against the toxic effects of copper overload (Wan  et al.,  ), dextran sulfate sodium (Arafa  et al.,  ),  p-dioxin (Ciftci  et al.,  ) and aluminum (Sood  et al.,  ) through down-modulation of TNF-\u03b1.\n CCl 4, carbon tetrachloride; DSS, dextran sulfate sodium; GalN,  -galactosamine; HbA1, haemoglobin \u03b11; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A; MCP-1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1; SiO 2, silicon dioxide.\n A reduction in the production of iNOS mRNA was observed when BALB/c mouse peritoneal macrophages cultured  ex vivo were treated with 1\u201320 \u03bcM curcumin (Chan  et al.,  );  in vivo, two oral treatments of 0.5 mL of a 10 \u03bcM solution of curcumin (92 ng\u00b7g \u22121 bodyweight) reduced iNOS mRNA expression in the livers of LPS-injected mice by 50\u201370% (Chan  et al.,  ). This suggests that curcumin is potent at nmol g \u22121 bodyweight. This efficacy was associated with two modifications of the schedule of dosing: firstly, an aqueous solution of curcumin was prepared by initially dissolving the compound in 0.5 N NaOH and then diluting it immediately with PBS; secondly, mice were fed curcumin at dusk after fasting. Inhibition of iNOS mRNA expression was not observed in the mice that were fed  ad libitum, suggesting that food intake may interfere with the absorption of curcumin.\n Curcumin usually manifests its biological response when given orally to mice at about 50\u2013500 mg\u00b7kg \u22121 bodyweight (Farombi and Ekor,  ). These doses, however, are too low to detect significant levels of curcumin in the serum. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear; however, there are several possible explanations. Firstly, curcumin is known to bind to numerous proteins present in the serum including albumin (Gupta  et al.,  ; Kim  et al.,  ). Secondly, curcumin is rapidly transported across the cells and tissues (Anand  et al.,  ). Thirdly, tetrahydrocurcumin, a metabolite of curcumin, was found to be more active than curcumin for treating chloroquine-induced hepatotoxicity in rats (Pari and Amali,  ). Fourthly, in another study it was shown that when curcumin was dissolved in 0.1 N NaOH it manifested its effects in animals in the \u03bcg\u00b7kg \u22121 range (Chan  et al.,  ).\n In one recent study the potential of a novel solid lipid curcumin particle (SLCP) preparation to produce adverse effects in rats after acute and sub-chronic administration was investigated (Dadhaniya  et al.,  ). The oral LD 50 of the preparation in rats as well as in mice was found to be greater than 2000 mg\u00b7kg \u22121 bodyweight. In the sub-chronic toxicity study, 180, 360 and 720 mg\u00b7kg \u22121 bodyweight day \u22121 of SLCP preparation was administered via oral gavage to W\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-21 08:51:59", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u751f\u7269,bioavailable,\u5236\u5242", "title": "\u59dc\u9ec4\u7d20\uff1aTNF\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u4fc3\u708e\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7684\u751f\u7269\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u963b\u6ede\u5242\uff082013\uff09 ", "title_en": "Curcumin: A bioavailable blocker of TNF and other pro-inflammatory biomarkers (2013)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3753829/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u751f\u7269", "\u5236\u5242"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "87fdf88938ee3a206f8f721200f1dc2c.png", "infoid": 1067111, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7528\u4e8e\u9f13\u8d77\u73b0\u4ee3\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u7ec4\u6210\u6587\u5e93\u5bb9\u6613\uff06amp; \u8fc5\u901f\u5730\u3002 \u5468\u56f4\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u53cd\u5e94UI\u5e93\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\u8fd9\u91cc\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u65b0\u4e1c\u897f\u5417\uff1f  \u5b9a\u5236\uff06amp; \u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8fc750\uff05\u7684\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u4ee3\u7801\u662fSCSS\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u8f7b\u677e\u5b9a\u5236\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1 ", "note_en": "A React Component library for buliding modern applications easily &amp; quickly.

It&#39;s had its ups and downs, from the era of net splits to the era of cancel culture. However, we&#39;re proud to announce that we&#39;ve completely obliterated the swamp removing the shackles on progress, and now we&#39;re sailing blue seas. YaRR!\n   The freenode digital autonomous zone is proud to announce IRC.com by freenode. In addition to our FOSS and free IRC bouncer service that keeps you connected 24/7, we now provide Android and iOS applications that connect to our freenode bouncer, enabling push notifications, avatars and a whole other suite of IRCv3 capabilities!\n Head on over to the  Android Play store or the  iOS App store and download, install and login! Share it with your friends as IRC and FOSS are no longer walled gardens - freedom is for everyone with no phone number required!\n For those of you that know what an API is and don&#39;t think it&#39;s a typo for a fruity company, there&#39;s webhooks built in so you can immediately integrate freenode and IRC.com into your development and org processes.\n The app is in  beta, but everything works. If you find any bugs, please let us know in  #freenode-bnc!\n  On the desktop and web, you can use your favorite desktop or web client to connect to the same connection that your iOS and Android apps are on. Simply use the freenode bnc. Use server  bnc.freenode.net with port  6697 and SSL enabled. Then, enter your  username:password in the connection password field and connect.\n We also deployed our  webchat. As of now it connects directly to freenode, but we will soon be adding IRC.com by freenode features which means it will connect to the freenode bnc in the future!\n  Now that IRC is up to speed with modern messaging clients, we&#39;re now aiming to take things further yet. IRC is a much more robust and useable messaging platform than anything else out there. We&#39;re just getting started.\n Special thanks goes out to tjr and his team, as well as the entire  freenode staff as we worked through the transition from legacy to present. An additional special thanks goes out to prawnsalad, who&#39;s previous contributions to the FOSS and IRC community, including the Kiwi IRC suite of FOSS, made all of this possible.\n The power of the people cannot be stopped. freenode is here to stay, no matter what gets thrown at it. It&#39;s now, as well, a recognized digital autonomous zone which gives it the unique ability to provide what freenode does best: freedom.\n freenode is IRC. freenode is FOSS. freenode is freedom.

This is somewhat daunting for me, as speech coding is R&amp;D, which tends to be very open ended; it\u2019s possible to work for months with no clear outcomes. In contrast the modem work is straight forward engineering, and I get the positive feedback of \u201chaving stuff work\u201d on a regular basis.\n So I\u2019m trying to time box the speech coding projects to a few days work each. This is quite a personal challenge, as there are just so many variables and paths to follow. It\u2019s so easy to go off on a tangent and watch the months pass!\n In this particular project I\u2019m looking at the Codec 2 700C Vector Quantiser (VQ), and exploring ways to make it more inherently robust to high pass and low pass filtering at the edges of the spectrum. The broad goal is to improve speech quality at a given bit rate, or support a lower bit rate at the same speech quality. I\u2019m targeting bit rates in the 600 bit/s range, and the lower end of the quality range (communications quality speech).\n  It\u2019s well known that the most important speech information is between 300 and 3000 Hz. Energy outside that range makes the speech sounds nicer, but doesn\u2019t help intelligibility much. Analog modes such as SSB exploit this by band limiting the speech so that the transmitter power is used just to punch through information in the narrow bandwidth that matters.\n With digital speech the RF bandwidth is not directly linked to the bandwidth of the decoded speech. For example FreeDV 700D uses around 1100 Hz of RF bandwidth, but the decoded speech has energy covering most of the 0 to 4000 Hz range.\n Codec 2 encodes and transmits the speech spectrum on a regular basis. As well as encoding parts of the spectrum necessary for intelligibility, it also has to encode other features, such as the high pass and low pass roll off the microphone and analog filters in the sound card. These features don\u2019t carry any intelligibility, but bits are consumed to encode them. When you have just 28 bits/frame \u2013 every bit matters!\n Turns out that some of the wilder variations in the speech spectrum from different sources of speech are in the 0-300Hz and 3000-4000Hz regions, for example different high pass or low pass filtering for a particular microphone or sound card. This can upset the Codec 2 quantiser, e.g. it might expend bits modelling a particular low pass filter response \u2013 lowering the quality of the perceptually important 300-3000 Hz information.\n So I\u2019ve prototyped a Vector Quantiser (VQ) that just uses the information in the 300-3000 Hz range to quantise the speech spectrum. However the VQ is trained on the full range, so it uses that full range to synthesise the speech, hopefully recovering some of the extended spectrum. There is also a limiter before the VQ to reduce the dynamic range of the frames.\n Here are some samples processed with the newamp1 two stage VQ, and the new subset VQ. Like the newamp1 algorithm, it works on vectors of K=20 mel-spaced magnitude samples. The speech codec is only partially quantised (10ms frames, original phase, unquantised pitch), so it would sound worse in a real world fully quantised codec. The \u201cnewamp1\u201d algorithm is used for Codec 2 700C [1] (and employed in FreeDV 700C/D/E), and uses 22 bit/frame (550 bits/s at a 40ms frame rate). The subset VQ uses just 12 bits frame (300 bits/s at a 40ms frame rate).\n  There are some samples where newamp1 sounds louder \u2013 this could be due to the gain limiter stage in the subset algorithm constraining the dynamic range. There also seems to be more high frequency response with newamp1, indicating subset is not recovering the high frequency speech energy as I had hoped. Both are quite intelligible, and acceptable for communications quality speech.\n   Both the samples and objective results show the subset VQ is holding up OK next to the reference newamp1, despite the low bit rate. I\u2019ve found that around 9 dB*dB spectral distortion gives acceptable results for my (low communications quality) use case.\n I tried adding an artificial low pass filter above 3400 Hz to a couple of the input samples, to simulate what might happen from different microphones.\n  It seems to work OK with the low pass filtered input samples, they sound pretty similar to the sample using the original source (one of the goals of this work):\n   I\u2019m surprised that a single stage VQ is working quite well at just 12 bits/frame. It\u2019s also encoding both the average frame energy and the spectral shape (I use a separate scalar quantiser for frame energy in newamp1). This is quite optimal from a VQ theory point of view, but sometimes not possible due to practical concerns such as the storage/CPU requirements for a single stage VQ.\n  Try a few more samples, and push this work through to a fully quantised speech codec.\n Seeing it\u2019s doing well with a single stage, it would interesting to see if it sounds better with multiple stages.\n A single stage VQ enables other tricks, like non-FEC techniques to make the VQ robust to bit errors, such as sorting the VQ indexes [2] or Neural Net style training with bit errors.\n  [1]  Codec 2 700C [2]  Codec 2 at 450 bits/s.
