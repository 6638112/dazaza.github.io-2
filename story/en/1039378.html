Well, COVID-19 has been like that. Some days Ifeel accomplished if I successfully check my email. I finally managed to clearout a backlog of an entire handfull of things that needed thoughtful responses,though, and so here I am, screaming into the void instead of at anyone inparticular.That said, let&#39;s talk a bit about radios. It is probably unsurprising by nowthat I have a long-running interest in radio and especially digital radiocommunications---but people who come to radio from all kinds of differentperspectives run into one odd problem: the curious refusal of any receiverto tune to certain frequencies in the 800-900MHz range.A lot of people have a general knowledge that this has to do with some kind oflegal prohibition on reception of cellular phones. That&#39;s roughly correct, butto fully explain the matter requires going into some depth on two differenttopics: FCC regulation of radio devices, and the development of cellularphones. The first sounds more boring, so let&#39;s hit that one first.Generally speaking, most electronic products manufactured or imported into theUnited States are subject to regulation by the Federal CommunicationsCommission. Specifically, they generally require an &#34;Equipment Authorization&#34;from the FCC prior to being marketed. For purposes of this regulatory scheme,electronic devices can be broadly divided into two categories: intentionalradiators and unintentional radiators.An intentional radiator is something that is specifically intended to broadcasta radio signal, like, say, a cellular phone. Intentional radiators must becertified to comply with the specific Part of the FCC regulations relevant tothe service for which they will be used. For example, cellular phones must becertified against Part 27, Wireless Communications Service, among others. Theexact process varies by the part and can be involved, but it generallyinvolves the manufacturer paying a certified test lab to perform certain testsand complying with various other filing requirements which include placing alabel on the device which specifies its FCC approval. Device manufacturersmust file with the FCC a description of how this label will appear before theyreceive approval to market the device, which is why the rough designs ofunreleased devices are sometimes revealed by the rough drawings in thesefilings---tech journalists will watch these to get the dimensions of newiPhones, for example.By the way, when I say the &#34;FCC Regulations,&#34; if you want to follow along athome these are promulgated as 47 CFR. So Part 27, for example, refers to 47 CFR27. The ever lovely Cornell LII has the whole thing for your entertainment:https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47. There&#39;s some reading for when you needhelp falling asleep.But that&#39;s all besides the point, I&#39;m more interested in talking aboutunintentional radiators, devices which are not intended to produce RF radiationbut may still do so as a result of the operation of the electronics---this isgenerally called a spurious emission, which is basically any RF emitted byaccident. These devices are certified under Part 15 of the FCC regulations[1], andso are sometimes called &#34;Part 15 devices.&#34; Part 15 essentially limits the typeand amplitude of spurious emissions to prevent random devices causing harmfulinterference due to defects in their designs.What would we call a radio *receiver*, then? It is explicitly a radio device,but is not intended to transmit anything. As a result, radio receivers are Part15 devices. Most of Part 15 is very general and doesn&#39;t really say anythingspecific about radio devices, it just limits spurious emissions and otherdesign standards. However, 15.121 gets a great deal more specific indiscussing &#34;Scanning receivers.&#39; A scanning receiver is specifically definedearlier in the regulation as a device capable of tuning to two or more frequencybands in the range of 30-960Mhz. This has the fun result that nothing for theGHz range is technically a scanner, but for practical reasons this doesn&#39;tmatter too much.So what&#39;s in 15.121? This is:47 CFR 15.121(a): ... scanning receivers and frequency converters designed ormarketed for use with scanning receivers, shall: (1) Be incapable of operating(tuning), or readily being altered by the user to operate, within the frequencybands allocated to the Cellular Radiotelephone Service in part 22 of thischapter (cellular telephone bands). ... (b) Be designed so that the tuning,control and filtering circuitry is inaccessible. The design must be such thatany attempts to modify the equipment to receive transmissions from the CellularRadiotelephone Service likely will render the receiver inoperable. The rest of paragraph (a) gives a pretty long clarification of &#34;readily beingaltered by the user,&#34; and it&#39;s amusing to think of a bunch of FCC characterssitting around a table trying to think up every alteration that is easy.Jumper wires and reprogramming micro-controllers are both right out.It gets even better:47 CFR 15.121(b): ... scanning receivers shall reject any signals from theCellular Radiotelephone Service frequency bands that are 38 dB or lower basedupon a 12 dB SINAD measurement, which is considered the threshold where asignal can be clearly discerned from any interference that may be present. So, here&#39;s this actual weird rule about scanners. Scanners are specificallyprohibited from being able to tune to any bands allocated to the Part 22Cellular Radiotelephone Service. This raises questions, and as you can imaginefrom the way I got here, I am about to spend a long time answering them.When the FCC says &#34;Cellular Radiotelephone Service,&#34; they aren&#39;t talking aboutcell phones in general. The CRS as I&#39;ll call it refers to a *very specific*cellular service, and that is AMPS.AMPS, the Advanced Mobile Phone System, is the most common in the US of the&#34;1G&#34; cellular services. Most carriers that were around when it was offeredcalled it &#34;Analog&#34; service, and indeed, AMPS was entirely analog. And, due toan odd detail of the regulation, large cellular carriers were *required* tooffer AMPS service until 2008, long after AMPS phones were no longer produced.You may have had a candy bar phone back when you would occasionally see an &#34;A&#34;for analog service, but I hope not into the late 2000s.There are a few things that we might infer from AMPS being an analog service.One of those things is that it probably did not employ strong encryption. Infact, AMPS employed no scrambling or enciphering of any kind. Your phoneconversations were just flapping in the wind for anyone to hear. This posed amajor practical problem for carriers in the &#39;90s as it was discovered that itwas not particularly difficult to intercept the call setup process from an AMPSphone and swipe its identification numbers, allowing you to basically stealsomeone else&#39;s cellular service. You can imagine that this was popular withcertain criminals with a need for untraceable but convenient communications.There was also a problem for consumers: their phone conversations could befairly easily overheard. There were a number of ways to do this, using anyradio scanner that covered that band for example. One particularly well-knownoption was a particular model of phone, the Oki 900, that had an unusuallyopen design (in terms of modifiability) that led to reverse engineered andmodified firmware being developed that made eavesdropping on other people&#39;scalls just, well, a feature it had.The scale of this problem was fairly large, and it was fairly well known. Forexample, let&#39;s turn to *my* favorite source of late-night reading, newspaperarchives. A lovely piece in the 30 May 1990 issue of The News and Observer,from Raleigh NC, takes the cheesy headline &#34;Monitoring Megahertz&#34; and goesinto some depth on the issue.&#34;I&#39;ve heard men call their wives and tell them they&#39;ll be home late, then calltheir girl friends,&#34; quipped one electronics store owner who had &#34;accidentally&#34;eavesdropped on cellular calls using a scanner. We&#39;ve all fat-fingered ourways into someone else&#39;s affairs I&#39;m sure, pun intended. Another person said&#34;when you look at the fact that there are how many thousands of people outthere who know my name, my mailing address and my salary...I put cellulareavesdropping down as being no different from that.&#34; In the face of technology,even in 1990, people had begun to abandon their privacy.Cellular carriers were not so happy about this, viewing it as an embarrassmentto their operation. I have heard before that cellular carriers went so far asto lobby for banning scanners entirely, although I am not aware of much hardevidence of this. What they did do was convince congress to stick an extra fewparagraphs onto an otherwise only tangentially related bit of legislationcalled the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act of 1992. This haslargely to do with abusive 1-900 numbers, which is its whole own topic intelephone regulation that I ought to take on sometime. But it also broughtalong just a bit more, an extra section that was subsequently amended severaltimes at the behest of cellular carriers. Let&#39;s read part of it, as amended,and with some editing for readability.The Commission shall prescribe and make effective regulations denying equipmentauthorization for any scanning receiver that is capable of---(A) receivingtransmissions in the frequencies allocated to the domestic cellular radiotelecommunications service, (B) readily being altered by the user to receivetransmissions in such frequencies, or (C) being equipped with decoders thatconvert digital cellular transmissions to analog voice audio.Well, we&#39;ve made it full circle: we&#39;ve seen the regulation, and we&#39;ve seen thelegislation that kicked the FCC to write the regulation. But how does thistranslate today? Things get a bit weird there.You see, the FCC seems to have (sensibly) interpreted the legislation asapplying directly to the Cellular Radiotelephone Service, even though thelegislation actually uses the term &#34;domestic cellular radio communicationsservice&#34; which seems almost equally lively to have been (1) intended to be moregeneral in its applicability or (2) a result of someone drafting legislationhaving read &#34;Cellular Radiotelephone Service&#34; in the FCC regulations but thenforgetting exactly how it was worded.The Cellular Radiotelephone Service was allocated 824-849MHz and later869-894MHz. That&#39;s it. You see, all of the digital cellular systems we usetoday are considered completely different services from Cellular Radiotelephone(usually called Wireless Communications Service although the details getcomplex). As a result, and to this day, those two sections in the 800MHz bandare verboten to scanners, and nothing else.And about those frequencies... after the requirement for AMPS service ended,all US carriers ceased AMPS operations. The old AMPS bands remain allocated forcellular service, and Verizon and a couple of smaller carriers use the samefrequencies for digital cellular services, which employ encryption and cannotbe intercepted by radio scanners. The prohibition on tuning scanners to thesefrequencies no longer makes any sense, especially since this ban has never beenextended to the AWS, PCS, and WCS bands that are more widely used by moderncellular phones.My suspicion is that the fact that this regulation was mandated by congressmakes it difficult for the FCC to remove or modify, even though it no longermakes technical sense. Unless congress finds some time for minutiae we areunlikely to see a change in this rule.In general, the whole thing is sort of bizarre. Broadly speaking, it is legalto listen in on any radio communications in the US, but cellular phones haverepeatedly gotten a special carve-out.Repeatedly? That&#39;s right. The whole AMPS band and scanners rule is the onlyspecific *technical* regulation, but the Electronic Communications Privacy Actof 1986 had actually already made it illegal to intercept or listen in oncellular calls, and this remains true to the present day... but there wasvirtually no enforcement, and that hasn&#39;t really changed to this day.And of course the whole thing has always felt like a farce. The solution to thepoor (or rather nonexistent) security design of AMPS was never legislation, butcellular carriers and the congress will be damned if they didn&#39;t try. Inpractice, the rule swept the entire eavesdropping problem under the rug forsome years, allowing carriers to continue operating the insecure AMPS systemfor far longer than they should have (...but exactly as long as the FCCrequired them to).Because listening to the modern digital cellular modes wouldn&#39;t be particularlyinteresting or useful anyway, and this rule doesn&#39;t really deter anyone withthe motivation and ability to decode those modes anyway, there are two lastingimpacts of this rather particular rule:1) SDRs and other receivers made today must implement this particular andpeculiar restriction in order to receive US equipment authorization, which isprobably part of the reason that a lot of SDRs... don&#39;t.2) To comply with the specifics of the regulation about rejection, manyreceivers use a notch filter around 850MHz in their frontend. This means thatreception throughout the 800-900MHz range is particularly poor, a realirritation as various public agencies and private agencies (especiallyrailroads) use land-mobile radios elsewhere in the 800-900Mhz range.Basically, more than a decade after any of this made sense, we&#39;re all stillhassling with it.[1] Part 15 is actually a lot more general and unintentional radiators arespecifically discussed under 47 CFR 15.101, but everyone just says Part 15.</p><p>Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://computer.rip/2020-11-28%20the%20verboten%20band.html">https://computer.rip/2020-11-28%20the%20verboten%20band.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/接收机/">#接收机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/receivers/">#receivers</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/warning/">#warning</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
