On  local news and in  national publications, they paint a shocking picture: Across the United States, retail stores are fighting a war against large, violent, highly organized criminal gangs. The attacks are common, and they’re escalating in severity. Thieves smash windows at luxury clothing stores, go full-on  Supermarket Sweep in the aisles of drugstores, and sell their wares undetected on Amazon or eBay or Facebook Marketplace. In the process, they’re endangering people’s lives and sapping corporate profits. The stores are losing the war.</p><p>你可能见过商店盗窃的故事，哪怕只是因为有很多。在当地新闻和全国性出版物上，他们描绘了一幅令人震惊的画面：在美国各地，零售商店正在与大规模、暴力、高度有组织的犯罪团伙作战。这些袭击很常见，而且其严重程度正在升级。窃贼砸碎豪华服装店的窗户，在药店的过道里大肆扫荡超市，并在亚马逊、eBay或Facebook Marketplace上出售未被发现的商品。在这个过程中，他们正在危及人们的生命，损害企业利润。商店正在输掉这场战争。</p><p> According to the retail executives, industry advocacy groups, and law-enforcement officers who have described their failing battles against these attacks, the problem has been building for years, but a spate of recent changes in laws and attitudes has threatened to tip American shopping into chaos: Felony-theft laws, they say, are now too permissive. Bail reform means that thieves are roaming the streets before they stand trial. Internet platforms where criminals profit are indifferent to pleas to shut down illegal storefronts. Employees don’t feel safe in stores, and understaffing makes theft even easier. To stabilize their businesses and make their communities safe, these executives, advocates, and officers say, they need different changes in both local and federal law.</p><p>零售业高管、行业倡导团体和执法人员描述了他们在打击这些袭击中失败的战斗，他们说，这个问题已经存在多年，但最近法律和态度的一系列变化有可能让美国购物陷入混乱：他们说，重罪盗窃法，他们现在太放纵了。保释改革意味着窃贼在受审前在街上游荡。罪犯获利的互联网平台对关闭非法店面的请求漠不关心。员工在商店里感觉不安全，人手不足使盗窃更加容易。这些高管、倡导者和官员表示，为了稳定企业、确保社区安全，他们需要对地方和联邦法律进行不同的修改。</p><p> The incidents these stories  use to illustrate the problem are genuine mayhem: At a Bay Area Nordstrom, police say, as many as 80 thieves executed a coordinated attack on the store. At another Nordstrom, this one in Southern California, thieves were caught on video assaulting workers with  bear spray. At a Louis Vuitton boutique in an Illinois mall, more than a dozen robbers overwhelmed sales clerks and made off with $120,000 in loot. Before dawn on a November day in New York City,  thieves used a hammer to smash their way into a closed Givenchy boutique and left with $80,000 in designer duds.</p><p>这些故事用来说明问题的事件是真正的混乱：警方说，在诺德斯特罗姆湾区，多达80名小偷对这家商店实施了协同攻击。在加利福尼亚州南部的另一个诺德斯特罗姆，窃贼被拍到用熊喷雾袭击工人的视频。在伊利诺伊州一家购物中心的一家路易威登精品店，十几名劫匪制服了店员，抢走了价值12万美元的赃物。在纽约市11月的一天黎明前，小偷们用锤子砸向一家关闭的纪梵希精品店，并带走了价值8万美元的设计师服装。</p><p>  No, we’re not. Recent news stories describe a shoplifting surge, but this narrative conflates an array of very different offenses into a single crime wave said to be cresting right now, all over the country, in a frenzy of naked avarice and shocking violence. Smash-and-grabs are awful, but they’re pretty rare (and already very much felonies). Nevertheless, a handful of viral videos and some troubling statistics from retailers and industry groups have set Americans on edge during the year’s most economically essential shopping season, wondering if the mall where they buy their Christmas presents might be next. The deeper you search for real, objective evidence of an accelerating retail crime wave, the more difficult it is to be sure that you know anything at all.</p><p>不，我们不是。最近的新闻报道描述了商店盗窃的激增，但这种说法将一系列非常不同的犯罪行为混为一谈，形成了一股犯罪浪潮，据说目前正在全国各地掀起赤裸裸的贪婪和令人震惊的暴力狂潮。粉碎和抢夺是可怕的，但它们非常罕见（而且已经非常严重）。尽管如此，一些病毒性视频以及零售商和行业团体发布的一些令人不安的统计数据让美国人在今年最具经济必要性的购物季节感到紧张，他们想知道他们购买圣诞礼物的购物中心是否是下一个购物中心。你越是深入地寻找零售犯罪浪潮加速的真实客观证据，就越难确保你知道任何事情。</p><p>  To determine what, if anything, is up with shoplifting in America, we have to answer two questions: Is theft really more common than it was in the recent past, and is current theft really more severe or harmful? You would think that answers to both of these questions would be readily available, if only because the topic has been discussed so much, but the reality of the situation is not quite so clear-cut.</p><p>要确定美国的商店盗窃究竟是怎么回事，我们必须回答两个问题：盗窃真的比最近更普遍吗？当前的盗窃真的更严重或更有害吗？你可能会认为，这两个问题的答案都是现成的，哪怕只是因为这个话题已经讨论了这么多，但现实情况并不是那么明确。</p><p> The first indicator that the theft-wave narrative may not hold water is that stories about it tend to garble terms and numbers. They  pair broad statistics about the commonness of shoplifting or larceny of any kind with  lurid descriptions of brazen armed robberies (which aren’t included in any shoplifting stats, because they are a different crime entirely) to illustrate a narrowly defined problem: organized retail crime. This is identified as repetitive, mostly nonconfrontational theft for profit, whose perpetrators strive to evade detection and keep each theft strategically below local dollar thresholds for felony larceny. Misdemeanors don’t attract law-enforcement attention, the theory goes, so criminals are able to strike again and again and flip their hauls to fences, who consolidate millions of dollars of stolen goods into inventory for online storefronts, where Amazon and Etsy and eBay shield them from detection and punishment.</p><p>第一个表明盗窃浪潮叙事可能站不住脚的指标是，关于它的故事往往会混淆术语和数字。他们将有关商店盗窃或任何形式盗窃的普遍性的广泛统计数据与厚颜无耻的武装抢劫的耸人听闻的描述（这些不包括在任何商店盗窃统计数据中，因为它们是完全不同的犯罪）结合起来，以说明一个狭义的问题：有组织的零售犯罪。这被认定为重复性的、主要是非对抗性的牟利盗窃，其犯罪者努力逃避侦查，并将每一次盗窃战略性地控制在重罪盗窃的当地美元阈值以下。该理论认为，轻罪不会引起执法部门的注意，因此犯罪分子能够一次又一次地打击，并将他们的抓捕行动转移到围栏上，这些围栏将数百万美元的赃物整合到网上商店的库存中，亚马逊、Etsy和eBay保护他们免受侦查和惩罚。</p><p> Whether any of these offenses—simple shoplifting, organized theft, or violent smash-and-grabs—are actually happening more frequently overall is, at best, ambiguous. If we look closely at crime statistics in San Francisco, which news stories paint as the epicenter of this crime wave and whose crime stats are often used to illustrate these stories, the idea doesn’t seem immediately ridiculous. Robberies, which is where smash-and-grabs generally fall, are slightly down citywide from 2020, according to the San Francisco Police Department, but larceny theft, which is where shoplifting would fall, is indeed up more than 19 percent. In the city’s central district, where expensive fashion boutiques and other kinds of retail outlets are clustered together, larceny theft was up 88 percent from 2020 as of early December, when  CNN used the number to demonstrate the dire nature of San Francisco’s crime problem.</p><p>这些罪行中的任何一种，无论是单纯的商店盗窃、有组织的盗窃，还是暴力的砸抢，实际上都在更频繁地发生，充其量都是模棱两可的。如果我们仔细研究一下旧金山的犯罪统计，那些新闻故事描绘了这场犯罪浪潮的震中，而犯罪的统计往往被用来说明这些故事，这个想法似乎并不可笑。根据旧金山警察局的说法，抢劫和抢劫一般都是从2020岁开始的，在城市范围内略有下降，但是盗窃案的发生率超过19%。在城市中心区，昂贵的时装精品店和其他种类的零售店聚集在一起，盗窃罪从十二月初的2020上升到88%，当时美国有线电视新闻网用这个数字来证明旧金山犯罪问题的可怕性质。</p><p> You’ve gotta admit, that’s a worrying number. Except, as you might remember, 2020 was kind of a weird year—people stayed home and many stores were closed for months at a time, which helped make the year’s crime statistics, to put it mildly,  unique. In San Francisco, the murder rate was (and still is) up, but recorded larceny thefts were way,  way down compared with 2019. Robberies were also down by almost a quarter. This year, the 88 percent increase in the central district’s larceny reports is still not enough to bring the area’s theft rate back up to pre-pandemic levels, which themselves had been dropping for decades.</p><p>你必须承认，这是一个令人担忧的数字。不过，正如你可能记得的，2020年是一个奇怪的年份，人们呆在家里，许多商店一次关闭数月，这有助于使这一年的犯罪统计数据变得温和、独特。在旧金山，谋杀率（现在还在上升），但是被记录的盗窃案比2019更为猖獗。抢劫案也减少了近四分之一。今年，中区盗窃案报告增加了88%，但仍不足以使该地区的盗窃率恢复到大流行前的水平，几十年来，盗窃率一直在下降。</p><p> So far, this dynamic holds true for much of the country,  according to FBI statistics. In 2020, the most recent year for which data are available, reports of robbery and larceny fell off a cliff. If we see a big jump in the near future, especially in violent smash-and-grabs, it’s worth asking how much the recent media attention itself contributed to the spike. Research has shown that sensational news coverage can  influence potential offenders to adopt highly publicized tactics in copycat crimes.</p><p>根据联邦调查局的统计数据，到目前为止，这种动态在美国大部分地区都适用。2020年是有数据的最近一年，有关抢劫和盗窃的报告从悬崖上跌落。如果我们在不久的将来看到一个大的飞跃，尤其是在暴力的抢夺中，那么值得一问的是，最近媒体的关注本身对这一激增有多大的贡献。研究表明，耸人听闻的新闻报道可以影响潜在的犯罪者在模仿犯罪中采取高度宣传的策略。</p><p>  Retail theft, organized or not, affects some kinds of stores more than others. Big-box stores, discount stores, and drugstores—which tend to be thinly staffed and stock lots of small, easy-to-steal, easy-to-flip products—experience more losses from sales-floor theft than, say, furniture stores do, and it makes sense that those types of retailers would be particularly outspoken about it. Questioning how much things have really changed doesn’t mean denying that a problem exists. If you’ve worked on a big-box sales floor, as I have, then you know that people attempting to steal large quantities of stuff that they probably intend to resell never has been particularly rare. The question is whether the way the problem is now being talked about matches reality.</p><p>零售盗窃，无论是否有组织，对某些种类的商店的影响比其他种类的商店更大。大卖场、折扣店和药店往往人手稀少，而且有很多小的、易偷易翻的产品，它们因销售场所盗窃而遭受的损失比家具店要多，而且这些类型的零售商会特别直言不讳，这是有道理的。质疑事情到底发生了多大变化并不意味着否认问题的存在。如果你像我一样在一个大卖场工作过，那么你知道，试图窃取大量他们可能打算转售的东西的人从来都不是特别罕见。问题是现在谈论这个问题的方式是否符合现实。</p><p> When I asked retailers how they squared falling property-crime rates with their own assertions that theft has skyrocketed, they weren’t exactly forthcoming. A spokesperson for Walgreens, which announced over the summer that it was closing some San Francisco locations because of high theft rates—a claim that has  prompted skepticism in local media—declined to discuss the topic with me in any specifics. A spokesperson for CVS Health, which  has been vociferous about organized theft and the need for new laws, told me that shoplifting has increased 300 percent in its stores since the beginning of the pandemic, and that the increase isn’t reflected in police data, because police were less responsive to reports of property crime when criminal courts were closed. The company would not say what that change represents in absolute numbers, elaborate on its theft-tracking methodology, or explain whether the rate has fluctuated significantly in the nearly two-year period since the pandemic began.</p><p>当我问零售商，他们是如何用自己的说法来应对不断下降的财产犯罪率的，即盗窃已经飙升时，他们并没有给出确切的答案。沃尔格林公司的发言人，在夏天宣布，由于高盗窃率，它关闭了一些旧金山的位置。这一说法引起了当地媒体的怀疑，拒绝在任何细节上与我讨论这个话题。CVS Health的一位发言人对有组织盗窃和新法律的必要性大声疾呼，他告诉我，自疫情开始以来，该公司商店里的店铺盗窃增加了300%，警方的数据没有反映出这种增加，因为当刑事法庭关闭时，警方对财产犯罪的报告反应不那么积极。该公司不愿说明这一变化在绝对数字上代表了什么，也不愿详细说明其盗窃追踪方法，也不愿解释自大流行开始以来的近两年时间里，盗窃率是否有显著波动。</p><p> As with San Francisco’s shopping-district larceny jump, a change of 300 percent is alarming at face value, as are other rates of change commonly cited in media reports on shoplifting. For example, a  survey conducted in early 2020 by the National Retail Federation (NRF), a trade association and advocacy group, found that of surveyed retailers that reported being victims of organized retail crime, three-quarters said that the crime had increased in their stores at least slightly in the previous 12 months. But according to Anita Lavorgna, a criminologist at the University of Southampton, in England, who specializes in organized crime, those numbers are not especially meaningful if we do not know what data are being compared or the methodology that produced them. Without more transparency, accounting for all of the variables that could have affected the results is hard. If store managers receive the message from corporate that documenting theft is of the utmost importance, for instance, one could easily imagine a spike in reported incidents of theft much more significant than any actual spike in theft itself. (The NRF  surveys dozens of retailers, but it does not disclose which retailers participate in its surveys, which makes checking its work impossible for third parties.)</p><p>与旧金山购物区盗窃案相比，300%的变化在面值方面是惊人的，媒体报道中关于商店行窃的其他变化率也是如此。例如，贸易协会和倡导组织全国零售联合会（NRF）在2020年初进行的一项调查发现，在报告为有组织零售犯罪受害者的受调查零售商中，四分之三的人表示，在过去12个月里，他们商店的犯罪至少略有增加。但据英国南安普敦大学的犯罪学家Anita Lavorgna（音译）说，如果我们不知道哪些数据被比较或产生了什么样的方法，那么这些数字就不是特别有意义。如果没有更多的透明度，很难解释所有可能影响结果的变量。例如，如果商店经理收到公司的信息，即记录盗窃行为是至关重要的，那么很容易想象，报告的盗窃事件的激增比盗窃本身的任何实际激增都要严重得多。（NRF调查了几十家零售商，但没有透露哪些零售商参与了调查，这使得第三方无法检查其工作。）</p><p> This type of fuzzy data is a common problem, Lavorgna told me. Another common problem is one of semantics: She’s not convinced that, from a criminological perspective, the “organized” label fits much of the theft that these retailers are describing. There’s just not much empirical evidence that flipping stolen makeup or baby formula or designer handbags online is primarily the province of huge, violent criminal-conspiracy organizations, she said. Meanwhile, certain states with specific statutes about organized theft define the act so broadly that it loses its usual meaning. In some places, two or more people conspiring together to steal anything a store might carry meets the legal definition of organized retail crime.</p><p>拉沃尼亚告诉我，这种模糊数据是一个常见的问题。另一个常见的问题是语义学：她不相信，从犯罪学的角度来看，“有组织的”标签符合这些零售商描述的大部分盗窃行为。她说，没有太多经验证据表明，在网上翻转偷来的化妆品、婴儿配方奶粉或名牌手袋主要是大型暴力犯罪阴谋组织的地盘。与此同时，某些州制定了关于有组织盗窃的具体法规，对该行为的定义过于宽泛，以至于失去了其通常的意义。在一些地方，两个或两个以上的人合谋盗窃商店可能携带的任何物品符合有组织零售犯罪的法律定义。</p><p> Just because a type of offense isn’t  organized crime doesn’t mean it isn’t serious or worth trying to stop, Lavorgna was careful to stipulate. But, she said, people or organizations that want to elicit fear in service of some goal—harsher laws, greater surveillance capabilities, access to increased funding—tend to stretch the “organized” label to fit all kinds of group crimes. This can create a gap between the scale of a problem and the scale or severity of the measures adopted to address it, according to Lavorgna’s research—a sign of a moral panic.</p><p>仅仅因为一种犯罪不是有组织犯罪并不意味着它不严重或不值得尝试阻止，Lavorgna谨慎地规定。但是，她说，那些希望在服务于某些目标时引发恐惧的人或组织——更严厉的法律、更强大的监控能力、获得更多资金的渠道——往往会扩大“有组织”的标签，以适应各种群体犯罪。根据拉沃尼亚的研究，这可能会在问题的规模和解决问题所采取措施的规模或严重性之间产生差距，这是道德恐慌的迹象。</p><p> In the U.S., states are already responding to widespread concern: Many have either already created organized-retail-crime task forces or are in the process of doing so. In California, Governor Gavin Newsome has proposed $255 million in additional law-enforcement funding to address retail theft. The INFORM Consumers Act, which would require online marketplaces to verify state-issued IDs for millions of sellers, has bipartisan support in Congress. Large brick-and-mortar retailers stand to benefit greatly from these measures, which encourage people to see even the pettiest property crime as a mortal sin, allocate public funding to help companies shore up their inventory issues, and weaken the competitive advantage of large-scale online-shopping platforms, whose success is a much larger existential threat to their bottom line than thieves could ever be.</p><p>在美国，各州已经在应对广泛的担忧：许多州要么已经成立了有组织零售犯罪工作队，要么正在这样做。在加利福尼亚州，州长加文·纽索姆提议增加2.55亿美元的执法资金，以解决零售盗窃问题。《通知消费者法案》要求在线市场验证数百万卖家的州颁发ID，该法案在国会得到了两党的支持。大型实体零售商将从这些措施中受益匪浅，这些措施鼓励人们将最微不足道的财产犯罪视为死罪，分配公共资金帮助企业解决库存问题，削弱大型网上购物平台的竞争优势，他们的成功对他们的底线构成了比窃贼更大的生存威胁。</p><p>  If you’ve made it this far and still feel unsure whether you understand how big of a problem “organized” retail theft is, well, take a number. Trying to quantify it means wading through a morass of slippery terms, questionably reliable estimates, and statistical sleights of hand. When you make it to the other side, you find a significant discrepancy between the enormity of organized retail crime as described by the retail industry and the actual dollar losses it attribute to the problem.</p><p>如果你已经做到了这一步，但仍然不确定自己是否理解“有组织的”零售盗窃问题有多严重，那么，拿一个数字。试图量化它意味着要涉过一个由难以捉摸的术语、令人怀疑的可靠估计和统计技巧组成的泥潭。当你走到另一边时，你会发现零售业所描述的有组织零售犯罪的严重性与它所造成的实际美元损失之间存在着巨大的差异。</p><p> Consider “shrink.” That’s the term retailers use to describe inventory losses from any cause—shoplifting, sloppy checkout practices, shipping errors, warehouse mistakes, or simple misplacement—usually expressed as a percentage of total sales. It can be very difficult for stores to determine how any particular piece of inventory was lost, so they are forced to estimate how much different kinds of losses contribute to their bottom line. In both 2019 and 2020, annual surveys of NRF members pegged the industry’s average overall shrink rate at 1.6 percent—for every $100 in sales, an average of $1.60 in inventory was lost. The NRF’s estimate of how much organized retail crime contributes to shrink is $700,000 for every $1 billion in sales, or $0.07 for every $100. Even by the estimates of groups lobbying lawmakers and the public to take the problem seriously, these types of crimes account for a tiny proportion of overall losses, on average. Paperwork errors and  self-checkout machines are both far graver threats to inventory management.</p><p>考虑“收缩”。这是零售商用来描述因任何原因造成的库存损失的术语，包括商店盗窃、结帐不慎、发货错误、仓库错误或简单的错放，通常以占总销售额的百分比表示。对于商店来说，很难确定任何特定的存货是如何丢失的，因此他们不得不估计不同种类的损失对他们的底线有多大影响。在2019年和2020年，NRF成员的年度调查都将行业的平均整体收缩率定为每100美元销售额1.6%，平均每100美元库存损失1.60美元。NRF估计，有组织零售犯罪对经济萎缩的贡献为每10亿美元销售额70万美元，或每100美元销售额0.07美元。即使根据游说议员和公众严肃对待这一问题的团体的估计，这些类型的犯罪平均只占整体损失的极小比例。文书工作错误和自动结账机对库存管理的威胁都要严重得多。</p><p> Consider, too, that  organized retail crime and  organized retail theft do not refer to the same phenomenon, even though they are sometimes used interchangeably. Theft of goods from sales floors is only one part of that seven cents of shrink. Returns fraud, gift-card schemes, and cargo theft are all also significant factors, but they’re rarely discussed in news reports about criminal threats to businesses. The stories just aren’t as good—there are no terrifying viral videos of people entering Home Depot, picking up a brand new drill, walking it up to customer service, and returning the unbought drill for store credit, which is then sold for half of its cash value on Craigslist.</p><p>同样，考虑到有组织的零售犯罪和有组织的零售盗窃并不是指相同的现象，即使它们有时互换使用。从销售楼层盗窃商品只是这7美分缩水的一部分。退货欺诈、礼品卡计划和货物盗窃也是重要因素，但在有关企业犯罪威胁的新闻报道中很少讨论这些因素。这些故事就没那么好了，没有令人恐惧的病毒视频显示人们进入家得宝，拿起一个全新的钻头，走到客户服务部，然后将未经包装的钻头退回商店信用卡，然后在Craigslist上以其现金价值的一半出售。</p><p> The CVS Health spokesperson I talked with argued that the company’s alarming shoplifting statistics during the pandemic failed to match police data because the cops themselves were showing up less to document theft. There is likely some truth to that theory. Read Hayes, the founder of the Loss Prevention Research Council, which conducts research on behalf of retail-industry clients, says that retirement and turnover trends in local police forces have led to fewer patrol officers available to respond to reports of petty crimes, which in turn has made retail workers less likely to bother reporting low-level offenses to the police. Hayes sees shoplifting and organized retail crime as big threats to the industry, but according to Jay Kennedy, a criminologist at Michigan State University, police declining to get involved in low-level offenses doesn’t necessarily signal a crisis. Kennedy echoed Hayes’s explanation for the sometimes scant police response to small thefts, but told me that his research has found that people tend to be fine with police and prosecutors prioritizing more serious or violent crimes over petty offenses.</p><p>与我交谈过的CVS健康发言人辩称，该公司在疫情期间令人震惊的商店盗窃统计数据与警方数据不符，因为警察自己在文件盗窃方面表现得更少。这个理论可能有些道理。代表零售业客户进行研究的损失预防研究委员会创始人里德·海斯说，当地警察部队的退休和更替趋势导致可用于应对轻罪报告的巡逻人员减少，这反过来也使得零售业工人不太可能费心向警方举报低级违法行为。海斯认为商店盗窃和有组织的零售犯罪是该行业的巨大威胁，但密歇根州立大学的犯罪学家杰伊·肯尼迪（Jay Kennedy）表示，警方拒绝参与低级犯罪并不一定意味着危机。肯尼迪赞同海斯的解释，即警方有时对小盗窃案反应不足，但他告诉我，他的研究发现，人们对警方和检察官将更严重或暴力犯罪置于轻罪之上的做法往往没有意见。</p><p> Where to draw the line between a misdemeanor and a felony has become central to how shoplifting is discussed, thanks in large part to the advocacy of the retail industry itself. The NRF, for example,  blames states’ increases in the felony-theft threshold—the value of goods that must be stolen in order to charge a thief with a more serious crime—for stores’ increased losses, and argues that the thresholds should be brought back down to combat theft. Kennedy doesn’t buy it. Increasing penalties for lesser offenses “would make some people feel comfortable and happy, but in reality it’s not going to have any substantial impact on the crimes,” he said. “It doesn’t hold up empirically, and it just doesn’t hold up practically.” This is War on Drugs logic, and it hasn’t panned out there either.</p><p>如何在轻罪和重罪之间划清界限，在很大程度上得益于零售业本身的倡导，已成为讨论商店盗窃的核心问题。例如，NRF将商店增加的损失归咎于各州提高了重罪盗窃门槛，即为了指控小偷犯有更严重的罪行而必须盗窃的货物的价值，并认为应该降低门槛以打击盗窃。肯尼迪不相信。他说，对较轻的罪行增加惩罚“会让一些人感到舒适和快乐，但实际上这不会对罪行产生任何实质性影响。”。“它在经验上不成立，实际上也不成立。”这是一场禁毒战争的逻辑，而且它也没有在那里发挥作用。</p><p> Indeed,  research on dozens of states that have increased their felony-theft thresholds since 2001 suggests that doing so presents no threat to public safety. And felony thresholds don’t map neatly onto how liberal a state’s government tends to be, or how “progressive” its prosecutors are. Even after loosening its law, California’s $950 minimum is still more conservative than most other states’. South Carolina and Texas, by comparison, set theirs at $2,000 and $2,500, respectively, but as far as I can tell, they are not being widely accused of  legalizing theft.</p><p>事实上，对自2001年以来提高重罪盗窃门槛的几十个州的研究表明，这样做不会对公共安全构成威胁。重罪门槛并不能很好地反映一个州的政府倾向于多自由，或检察官的“进步”程度。即使在放松了法律之后，加州950美元的最低标准仍然比其他大多数州更保守。相比之下，南卡罗来纳州和得克萨斯州分别将他们的价格定为2000美元和2500美元，但据我所知，他们并没有被广泛指责盗窃合法化。</p><p>  This year, when the NRF asked the retailers in its survey which problems had become more of a priority for them in the past five years, organized retail crime wasn’t the most popular answer. It was in-store violence, specifically shootings. Retail stores are the site of a tremendous amount of violence in American life, and have been for a long time. When I worked at Best Buy in the late 2000s, there was plenty of shoplifting, both recreational and professional, but the incidents I remember most vividly had nothing to do with theft. They involved people putting their hands on me or my co-workers, or, in one case, trying to run over one of us in the parking lot. The situation has deteriorated since then. At their most extreme, malls,  grocery stores, and big-box stores have been the scene of scores of mass shootings in the past two decades, including atrocities such as the 2019 Walmart shooting in El Paso, Texas, that left 23 people dead.</p><p>今年，当NRF在调查中询问零售商在过去五年中哪些问题对他们来说更重要时，有组织的零售犯罪并不是最受欢迎的答案。那是店内暴力，尤其是枪击。零售商店是美国生活中大量暴力事件的发生地，而且长期以来一直如此。当我在21世纪末在百思买工作时，有很多商店盗窃，包括娱乐性的和专业性的，但我记得最清楚的事件与盗窃无关。有人把手放在我或我的同事身上，或者，在一个案例中，试图在停车场碾过我们中的一个人。自那时以来，情况恶化了。在最极端的情况下，购物中心、杂货店和大卖场在过去20年中发生了数十起大规模枪击事件，包括2019年在德克萨斯州埃尔帕索发生的导致23人死亡的沃尔玛枪击案等暴行。</p><p> More recently—and far more commonly—retail workers and sometimes patrons have had to put up with a  wave of assaults during the pandemic, including a number of murders. Many of these attacks have been provoked by simple safety protocols, and this violence, combined with the industry’s low pay, has helped make retail-job openings particularly difficult to fill this year. Understaffed stores can  invite more theft, as can stores where  existing employees hate their job. How many people who make $12 an hour to get screamed at by strangers for 31 hours a week (any more and the company would have to give them health insurance) are going to interrupt someone dumping bottles of shampoo into a garbage bag so that they can save their corporate overlords a rounding error’s worth of losses? Is it worth finding out if that guy has a gun?</p><p>最近，零售业工人和有时顾客不得不忍受大流行期间的一波袭击，包括一些谋杀案，这种情况要普遍得多。许多此类袭击都是由简单的安全协议引发的，而这种暴力行为，再加上该行业的低薪，使得今年的零售业职位空缺特别难以填补。人手不足的商店可能会招来更多盗窃，现有员工讨厌他们工作的商店也是如此。有多少人为了每周31个小时（再多的话，公司将不得不给他们提供医疗保险）被陌生人尖叫而每小时挣12美元，他们会打断别人把几瓶洗发水倒进垃圾袋，这样他们就可以挽救公司的老板们一个相当于四舍五入误差的损失？那家伙是否有枪值得一查吗？</p><p> If we’re concerned with the types of crime that destroy lives and businesses, endanger retail workers on the job, and discourage people from going out to enjoy themselves, then shoplifting is the wrong crime to focus on. The problem is violence, which frequently has nothing to do with shoplifting at all. But shoplifting is an easier conversation for the retail industry to have, and one that plenty of people—journalists included—are keen to get in on. It’s a thousand other zeitgeisty arguments in one: about the role of police and prison in society, about the efficacy of tough-on-crime politicians or “Defund the police” as a slogan, about how serious property crime is relative to other types of harm, about whether liberal local governments are actually inept, about why there’s so much open human misery on the streets of San Francisco.</p><p>如果我们关心的是破坏生命和商业、危及在职零售业工人、阻止人们出去享受生活的犯罪类型，那么商店盗窃是一种错误的犯罪。问题在于暴力，而暴力往往与商店盗窃毫无关系。但对于零售业来说，商店盗窃是一个更容易进行的话题，包括记者在内的许多人都渴望参与其中。这是一个关于警察和监狱在社会中的作用，关于严厉打击犯罪政客或“解散警察”作为口号的效力，关于财产犯罪相对于其他类型伤害的严重程度，关于自由派地方政府是否真的无能，为什么在旧金山的街道上有如此多的人类苦难。</p><p> Good old thieves, that is to say, are a palatable common enemy. Better to fear them than the other types of casual violence that have seeped into everyday life in America, and the rot that may have created it.</p><p>也就是说，善良的老盗贼是一个讨人喜欢的共同敌人。比起渗透到美国日常生活中的其他类型的随意暴力，以及可能造成这种暴力的腐朽，更好的是害怕他们。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/商店/">#商店</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/盗窃/">#盗窃</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
