To have the compiled program call `yourfh()` for file I/O use: `cobc -fcallfh=yourfh` In turn `yourfh()` may call `EXTFH()` to use I/O functions from GnuCOBOL. The external file handler can also be directly invoked from COBOL, too, using `CALL &#34;EXTFH&#34;`. ** Note: Not each flag contained in the FCD3 is handled already **** file handling: added support for [RE]WRITE FILE file FROM source** file handling: name mapping adjusted (improved MF and ACU-compatibility): entries starting with a period or number are not resolved any more, periods in the external identifier are always replaced by underscore -&gt; MY.FILE is resolved by DD_MY_FILE, dd_MY_FILE, MIFILE now; prefixes &#34;-F &#34; and &#34;-D &#34; are removed from external names; if filename is not absolute after translation, COB_FILE_PATH is now still applied; File name mapping now applies both to COBOL statements and CALLable CBL_ and C$ file routines. ** Screen I/O: initial mouse support (for details see runtime.cfg), use of CURSOR clause in SPECIAL-NAMES for positioning on ACCEPT** on abort a stack trace will be genereated, this can be suppressed by runtime configuration option COB_STRACK_TRACE** the dump that is generated on abort (depending on -fdump at compile-time) was heavily improved and combines consecutive identical OCCURS items, leading to smaller dump files** changes in handling COPY statement: * copybook names that contain an extension aren&#39;t searched with additional extensions [as post-rc1-change this may be set to old behaviour by defining COB_MULTI_EXTENSION when building GnuCOBOL/cobc] * library names are now tested for environment &#34;COB_COPY_LIB_libname&#34;, allowing the directory to specified externally (also as no-directory by exporting with empty value) and has a fallback (with a warning) to be effectively ignored (as previous versions did this)* Removed functions** SCREEN SECTION, REPORT-WRITER module: removed non-standard extension &#34;LINE / COL signed-integer&#34; (inadvertently available since 2.2/3.0rc1); which will now raise an error &#34;unsigned integer expected&#34;; if used replace by standard &#34;LINE / COL +/- integer&#34;* Obsolete features (will be removed in the next version if no explicit user requests are raised)** support for Borland C compiler and linker** -fif-cutoff flag for cobc (currently disabled, see entry below in 3.0rc1)** old OpenCOBOL-only-EXTFH* Changes to the COBOL compiler (cobc) options:** new options: -f[no]-ec=exception-name to tune the exception checks similar to the &gt;&gt;TURN directive, you may also leave out the &#34;EC-&#34; prefix here, example to enable all checks but disable all bound checks but OCCURS DEPENDING ON: cobc -debug -fno-ec=bound -fec=bound-odo** adjustments to warning options: -Wextra &#34;new&#34; option to enable every possible warning that is not dialect specific (this option used to be called -W) -Wadditional new warning group for all warnings that don&#39;t have a group on their own -Wno-error and -Wno-error=&lt;warning&gt; to treat (specific &lt;warning&gt;s) not as error -Wdangling-text for raising the warning &#34;source text after program area&#34;, not included in -Wall any more -Wno-ignored-error allows to suppress messages that normally would be an error and are only allowed because they are never executed -Wimplicit-define and -Wcorresponding are now enabled by default -f[no]-diagnostics-show-option, enabled by default, shows the command line option responsible for the diagnostic message extra information to a warning (or error) is now marked as &#34;note:&#34;** the interal Xref got a huge speedup, has all references in ascending order now and includes the total amount of direct references** the interal listing got a speedup and has all error references in ascending order now** cobc -g (and configure --enable-debug) use the most expressive debugging options available on the system** cobc -g now auto-includes references to the COBOL source file and to all ENTRY and SECTION elements to ease source level debugging * Changes in the COBOL runtime (libcob)** Messages from the COBOL runtime are also translated now (if installed). To prevent this disable translations in general with using the configure option --disable-nls (or by deactivating ENABLE_NLS in config.h).** libcob.h does no longer auto-include gmp.h (behavior since 2.x), if you link against libcob and need cob_decimal include gmp.h/mpir.h yourself before; otherwise you do not need it in your include path any more** execution times of INSPECT and INITIALIZE with OCCURS were heavily cut down** convenience functions for direct C access to COBOL fields and for debugging were added, see new C-API documentation** first-time file-locking under Win32** Breaking change: previously the return-code of registered error handlers (by CBL_ERROR_PROC) were ignored. This was changed according to the documentation for CBL_ERROR_PROC -&gt; a RETURN-VALUE of ZERO skips further error handlers to be called, including the internal one.* New build features** Running the internal tests by make check now fails if the testsuite has any unexpected result.** The modules and test programs in the NIST COBOL-85 test suite (tests/cobol85) may now be build and/or tested and/or the test results checked separately. You now may also run the tests with a previous installed version of GnuCOBOL (or a version specified by a manual temporary setup). For details see tests/cobol85/README.** new configure option --with-math=ARG to specify which math multiple precision library is to be used, where ARG may be: check (default), gmp, mpir** new configure options --with-xml2 / -without-xml2 to explicit force/disable XML runtime support, otherwise it will be included if found as working** new configure option --with-json / -without-json to explicit force/disable JSON runtime support, otherwise it will be included if found as working Note: As a special case you may built-in cJSON by placing its source in the folder &#34;libcob&#34;. If it is included there, this version will be compiled into libcob. It may be enforced with --with-json=local, like --with-json=cjson and --with-json=json-c enforce the given library.** To adjust the build system for GMP/MPIR you may use the new variables GMP_CFLAGS / MPIR_CFLAGS and GMP_LIBS / MPIR_LIBS. If unset configure will try pkg-config.** To adjust configure to use libxml2 you may use the new variables XML2_CFLAGS and XML2_LIBS. If unset configure will use pkg-config / xml2-config.** To adjust configure to use libcjson you may use the new variables CJSON_CFLAGS and CJSON_LIBS, similar JSON_C_CFLAGS and JSON_C_LIBS for libjson-c. If unset configure will use pkg-config.** new configure option --enable-hardening to either enable GNU C&#39;s hardening options or leave as-is, or disable (which previous versions effectively did)** build system: defaults.h is not created or included any more, all configure provided defines are now found in the single header config.h** Any time after `make` you can call `pre-inst-env` script to use the still- uninstalled binaries. Samples: pre-inst-env cobc -xj prog.cob pre-inst-env cobcrun -M prog start pre-inst-env may also be called without parameters to start a new shell session with the environment adjusted to use the uninstalled version.* Too much bug fixes to list here (please check ChangeLogs for full details), includes the following CVEs: ** compiler (may be triggered with special crafted source files) CVE-2019-14468, CVE-2019-14486, CVE-2019-14528, CVE-2019-14541, CVE-2019-16396, CVE-2019-16395* GnuCOBOL&#39;s getopt implementation honors POSIXLY_CORRECT now: if set to any value the option parsing in cobc, cobcrun and CBL_GC_GETOPT stops at the first nonoption, otherwise it stays with the old behaviour and re-orders nonoptions to the end)* Known issues in 3.1** testsuite: * if built with vbisam, cisam or disam, depending on the version used, some tests will lead to UNEXPECTED PASS, while others may fail * possibly failing tests (false positives): * temporary path invalid * compiler outputs (assembler) * compile from stdin * NIST: OBNC1M.CBL false positive (the test runner uses a nonportable way of emulating a program kill)** the recent additions of &#34;&gt;&gt; TURN&#34; and &#34;variable LIKE variable&#34; may not work as expected in all cases** features that are known to not be portable to every environment yet (especially when using a different compiler than GCC) * function with variable-length RETURNING item * USAGE POINTER, which may need to be manually aligned~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ GnuCOBOL 3.0-rc1 released (20180422)* New GnuCOBOL features** REPORTWRITER module added** INDEXED file handling: added support for sparse and split keys** file handling: added support for [RE]WRITE FILE file FROM source** DISPLAY ... UPON PRINTER may be redirected to an external command (new runtime configuration COB_DISPLAY_PRINT_PIPE) or appended to a file (new runtime configuration COB_DISPLAY_PRINT_FILE, which takes precedence)** XML GENERATE statement (note: runtime support needs additional library libxml2)** JSON GENERATE statement (note: runtime support needs additional library cJSON)** Improved support for different compiler extensions (ACUCOBOL, IBM, Fujitsu, MicroFocus COBOL, Microsoft COBOL, RM/COBOL and more)** Parser support for many features of different compilers, for example PIC 1 / USAGE BIT, ACUCOBOL extensions for graphical controls VALIDATE statement and much more. Most of them will be fully implemented in a later version...** Option to dump (partial) data of modules on abort. Use new cobc option -fdump=&lt;scope&gt; to prepare the module and optional use new runtime configuration options COB_DUMP_FILE and COB_DUMP_WIDTH to adjust the dump.** C interface: new functions cob_set_runtime_option / cob_get_runtime_option to set/get special runtime options (currently FILE * for trace and printer output) or to reload the runtime configuration after changing environment** file handling: include support for a callable EXTFH interface also provided by several compilers including Micro Focus This allows users to insert an external file handler while retaining all of the normal COBOL I/O functions with a possible callback to libcob. To have the compiled program call `yourfh()` for file I/O use: `cobc -fcallfh=yourfh` In turn `yourfh()` may call `EXTFH()` to use I/O functions from GnuCOBOL. The external file handler can also be directly invoked from COBOL, too, using `CALL &#34;EXTFH&#34;`. ** Note: Not all flags contained in the FCD3 are handled already *** Changed cobc options:** The option -debug (runtime checks) no longer implies -ftrace (option to trace program flow of the generated module with COB_SET_TRACE). You may specify -ftrace[all] along -debug if you want to use this feature.** The option -E (preprocess file) does not imply an output file any more. If no output file is explicit specified with -o filename.i the output will be written to stdout (behavior of versions 1.1 is restored). Requesting output to stdout explicit by using a dash as output name is also possible.** Changed options for listing: The option -tsymbols was replaced by -ftsymbols and therefore can now also be explicit deactivated by specifying -fno-tsymbols. New options for suppressing (or explicit requesting) parts of the listing: -fno-theader suppress all headers from listing while keeping page breaks -fno-tmessages suppress warning and error summary from listing -fno-tsource suppress actual source from listing (for example to only produce the cross-reference)** The option -fif-cutoff (option to change generated C sources to use a label + goto for nested if/else) was deactivated to allow the C compiler to fully control the program flow. ** Please report if you have a need for this option as it will be ** ** removed permanently in the next release of GnuCOBOL otherwise. *** Changes in the COBOL runtime (libcob)** updated exception handling, GnuCOBOL now only cleans raised exceptions when requested by SET LAST EXCEPTION TO OFF** The standard-format for program tracing was changed and is now adjustable by the runtime configuration option COB_TRACE_FORMAT.* New build features** New test suite for manual tests (especially SCREEN I/O), run with `make checkmanual`. Note: You may want to adjust the test runner tests/run_prog_manual.sh which defaults to xterm in GUI environments and screen in terminal environments.** new configure option --enable-debug-log to allow *internal* tracing of GnuCOBOL (intended for developers of GnuCOBOL only)* Too much bug fixes to list here (please check ChangeLogs for full details).~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ GnuCOBOL 2.2 released (20170906)* Move to GPL/LGPL 3* New GnuCOBOL features (too much to list)** User Defined Functions, FUNCTION-ID.** New intrinsic functions ABSOLUTE-VALUE alias for ABS CURRENCY-SYMBOL CURRENCY-SYMBOL of the current program FORMATTED-CURRENT-DATE ISO 8601 datetime function FORMATTED-DATE ISO 8601 datetime function FORMATTED-DATETIME ISO 8601 datetime function FORMATTED-TIME ISO 8601 datetime function TEST-FORMATTED-DATETIME ISO 8601 datetime function INTEGER-OF-FORMATTED-DATE date to integer HIGHEST-ALGEBRAIC now implemented LOWEST-ALGEBRAIC now implemented LOCALE-COMPARE now implemented NUMVAL-F now implemented TEST-NUMVAL now implemented TEST-NUMVAL-C now implemented TEST-NUMVAL-F now implemented LENGTH-AN alias for BYTE-LENGTH MODULE-CALLER-ID return the name of the caller MODULE-DATE current module: compilation date MODULE-TIME current module: compilation time MODULE-FORMATTED-DATE current module: formatted datetime MODULE-ID current module: PROGRAM-ID MODULE-PATH current module: path on compile time MODULE-SOURCE current module: name on compile time MONETARY-DECIMAL-POINT LOCALE based fiscal decimal point MONETARY-THOUSANDS-SEPARATOR LOCALE based fiscal visual grouping separator Note: The functions that are actually available as intrinsic functions depend on the -std used. Function names that aren&#39;t marked as intrinsic functions by the current -std can be used freely as user defined words or even as user defined functions.** New system functions C$CALLEDBY return the name of the caller CBL_GC_FORK fork current process (not on Windows) CBL_GC_WAITPID wait for process to end CBL_GC_GETOPT (CBL_OC_GETOPT) command line option parser for COBOL CBL_GC_PRINTABLE (C$PRINTABLE) check if character is printable CBL_GC_HOSTED (CBL_OC_HOSTED) provides access to C extern variables, like stdin, errno CBL_GC_NANOSLEEP CBL_OC_NANOSLEEP CBL_GET_SCR_SIZE get current terminal size - if any CBL_READ_KBD_CHAR get character from terminal CBL_SET_CSR_POS set current position on terminal x&#39;E4&#39; clear terminal screen x&#39;E5&#39; ring the bell** full support of ANSI 85 debugging module: USE FOR DEBUGGING declarative procedures (only part of the generation if WITH DEBUGGING MODE is active during compilation) and special register: 01 DEBUG-ITEM. 02 DEBUG-LINE PIC X(6). 02 FILLER PIC X VALUE SPACE. 02 DEBUG-NAME PIC X(30). 02 FILLER PIC X VALUE SPACE. 02 DEBUG-SUB-1 PIC S9(4). 02 FILLER PIC X VALUE SPACE 02 DEBUG-SUB-2 PIC S9(4). 02 FILLER PIC X VALUE SPACE. 02 DEBUG-SUB-3 PIC S9(4). 02 FILLER PIC X VALUE SPACE. 02 DEBUG-CONTENTS PIC X(n). With &#34;n&#34; being at least 30, size is increased if USE FOR DEBUGGING identifier is used and the identifier has a longer size.

COBOL sources compiled with these dialects are therefore likely to compile with the specified compiler and vice versa: sources that were compiled on the specified compiler should compile without any issues with GnuCOBOL. With the &#34;non-strict&#34; dialects GnuCOBOL will activate the complete feature-set where it doesn&#39;t directly conflict with the specified dialect, including reserved words and GnuCOBOL specific extensions. COBOL sources compiled with these dialects therefore may work only with GnuCOBOL. COBOL sources may need a change because of rich feature-set and reserved words in GnuCOBOL, otherwise offending words may be removed by `-fno-reserved=word`. COBOL-85, X/Open COBOL, COBOL 2002 and COBOL 2014 are always &#34;strict&#34;.** New listing options: -t listing, -T wide listing, --tlines=lines, lines per page of listing; -Xref now handled internally, if you want to use cobxref define COB_EXTERNAL_XREF during configure Note: -P, generate preprocessor listing, is still available (and improved)** All compiler configuration flags may be set on command line to override a specific setting of the current -std, see cobc --help** All warnings can be explicit enabled/disabled or even marked as error, see cobc --help, examples: -Wunreachable warn about likely unreachable statements -Wno-dialect do not warn about dialect specific issues -Werror treat all warnings as errors -Werror=&lt;warning&gt; treat specified &lt;warning&gt; as error** Options for the C compiler/linker: -K &lt;entry&gt;, compile entry point as static (resolve  ...</p><p>Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/p/gnucobol/code/HEAD/tree/branches/gnucobol-3.x/NEWS">https://sourceforge.net/p/gnucobol/code/HEAD/tree/branches/gnucobol-3.x/NEWS</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/gnucobol/">#gnucobol</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/warning/">#warning</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
