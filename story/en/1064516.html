It was a balmy day in Ithaca, New York. I went for a walk after work to sit and meditate at my favorite spot near a waterfall in Upper  Buttermilk State Park. It’s really nice to have such a huge backyard cared for by the public like Upper Buttermilk. I feel privileged.</p><p>2006年7月18日星期二。这是纽约伊特卡的一天。在上班后，我去散步，坐在我最喜欢的地方在瀑布上的瀑布附近的瀑布。真的很高兴拥有这样一个巨大的后院被公众照顾上部酪乳。我感到特权。</p><p> Before I left my private meditation area I did a standing STARS (Somatics Transformation and Restorative Systems) exercise called “Aligning the Three Tan Tiens.” Something inside me made me feel invincible. You know that feeling you have when you are young and feel invincible? Well, as I walked out of the wooded area I was in, I found some young mushrooms. Their caps were hanging down like closed umbrellas. I mistook them for inky caps ( Coprinus spp.) even though I spotted an  Amanita nearby–its cap was fully open, and not hanging down. Thinking back, I should have been more suspicious as mushrooms do grow in colonies.</p><p> 在我离开我的私人冥想区域之前，我做了一个常设的明星（躯体转化和恢复系统）锻炼，称为“对齐三棕褐色。”。我内心的东西让我感到不稳定。你知道你年轻的时候，你的感觉是无敌的吗？好吧，就像我走出了我所在的树林区域一样，我发现了一些年轻的蘑菇。他们的帽子像封闭的雨伞一样垂下来。我将它们误认为是墨水帽（Coprinus SPP。）即使我发现了阿曼塔附近的伞形池 - 它的帽子完全打开，而且没有挂在一起。回顾一下，当蘑菇在殖民地中生长时，我应该更怀疑。</p><p> I took three home with me. I couldn’t find my Mushroom book, was in a hurry, so I trusted my judgment, fried them up in olive oil, and ate them as a side dish. I should have recognized then that they weren’t inky caps, because inky caps exude a black substance when you fry them.</p><p> 我和我一起拿了三个家。我找不到我的蘑菇书，很匆忙，所以我相信我的判断，用橄榄油炒它们，并用它们作为一道菜。我应该认识到，他们不是墨水，因为当你炒它们时，墨帽散发出黑色物质。</p><p> They honestly did not taste that good, rather bland in my opinion. I thought to myself, “Gee, I don’t think I’ll ever pick and eat these again.” (Little did I know the truth of my thought at the time).</p><p> 在我看来，他们诚实没有品尝那么好，更令人平淡。我想到了自己，“哎呀，我不认为我会再挑选和吃这些了。” （我现在很少知道我思想的真相）。</p><p> I went dancing afterward, and bragged to my friends that I had picked and eaten some wild mushrooms for dinner. A friend asked me “Were they all white?” I said “Yes.” She scolded me, saying, “My mother told me never to eat an all white mushroom.” At that point, I got concerned. I covered it up by saying, “I’m OK, I know what I’m doing and I don’t feel sick.”</p><p> 后来我跳舞，勇敢地拿着我的朋友，我挑选了一些野生蘑菇吃饭。朋友问我“他们都是白色的吗？”我说是。”她责骂我，说：“我的母亲告诉我永远不会吃一个白人蘑菇。”那时，我担心了。我通过说，“我很好，我知道我在做什么，我感到恶心。”</p><p> I got home. I was hungry, so I ate some nachos and humus and drank some apple juice before going to bed around 11 p.m. I still felt fine, so I wasn’t worried.</p><p> 我回到家了。我饿了，所以我吃了一些玉米虫和腐殖质，然后喝了一些苹果汁，然后睡了11点左右。我仍然觉得很好，所以我并不担心。</p><p> The crack of dawn that time of year is early, sometime between 4:30 and 5:00. It’s a really neat time if you’ve never experienced it–the silence is almost unbearable. To most busy people it  is unbearable. There is nothing to drown out the chatter in the head. City folks usually find it uncomfortable in contrast to the noise of the city. I’ve become accustomed to awakening with the light. This morning I woke a little earlier than usual. I couldn’t quite tell whether it was still night or just breaking into the day.</p><p> 黎明的裂缝是一年中的早期，4:30到5:00之间的某个时间。如果你从未经历过它，这是一个非常好的时间 - 沉默几乎无法忍受。对于大多数忙碌的人来说，这是无法忍受的。没有什么可以淹没在头部的喋喋不休。与城市的噪音相比，城市人们通常会发现它不舒服。我已经习惯于用光唤醒。今天早上我比平时早些时候醒来。我不能告诉它是否仍然是夜晚还是只是闯入当天。 </p><p> I felt queasy. It was the same feeling I had when I had food poisoning. Before I had any more time to assess my state, I realized I needed to get to the bathroom. I barely made it to the royal throne when I started heaving my guts out. The vomiting reflex was strong. The pressure of the strong contractions forced stuff out both ends of the GI tract, uncontrollably. I had a severe case of vomiting and diarrhea. At that point, deep down I knew I had made the big mistake: I HAD EATEN  AMANITA VIROSA, AKA, “THE DESTROYING ANGEL”.  1</p><p>我感到很快。当我有食物中毒时，它的感觉是一样的。在我有更多时间评估我的州之前，我意识到我需要去洗手间。当我开始伸出胆量时，我几乎没有把它带到皇家王位上。呕吐的反射很强。强烈收缩的压力迫使胃肠道的两端，无法控制地。我有一个严重的呕吐和腹泻。在那一点，我知道我已经犯了大错误：我吃过amanita viosa，又名“摧毁天使”。 1</p><p>  For the next three hours, I was making trips constantly from my bed to the bathroom. I was still in denial. My housemate asked me the first time I was up “Are you OK?” I said “Yes, I was just sick.” By the time 7:30 had rolled around, I had talked to my girlfriend, called in sick to work and still had not mentioned that I thought it was  Amanita poisoning. Finally, my housemate again asked me what was going on. I responded saying “I think I accidentally poisoned myself with some bad mushrooms last night.”</p><p>  在接下来的三个小时里，我正在从床上持续前往浴室。我还在否认。我的室友第一次问我“你还好吗？”我说“是的，我只是生病了。”到了7:30遍布周围的时间，我和我的女朋友谈过，叫做生病的工作，仍然没有提到我认为这是amanita中毒。最后，我的室友再次问我正在发生什么。我回答说：“我觉得昨晚我偶然地用一些糟糕的蘑菇杀了自己。”</p><p> He said “Maybe you should go get checked out at the local “Convenient Care Center.” I silently thought to myself, “Yeah, If I go there, I’ll be sitting and waiting and by the time someones sees me, I’ll be dead.”</p><p> 他说：“也许你应该去当地的”方便护理中心“检查。我默默地想到自己，“是的，如果我去那里，我会坐着等待，当某个人看到我时，我会死的。”</p><p> I found my mushroom book and looked up the symptoms for Amanita poisoning: vomiting and diarrhea or severe constipation 6-8 hrs after consumption. 2 Oh, and by the way, it’s now destroying your liver and 50 to 80 percent of the people who ingest  Amanita DO NOT SURVIVE! At that point, I knew I was in deep, deep doo doo and in for the biggest fight of my life,  for my life.</p><p> 我发现了我的蘑菇书，并抬头抬起氨基塔中毒的症状：消费后呕吐和腹泻或严重便秘6-8小时。 2哦，顺便说一下，它现在正在摧毁你的肝脏和50％到80％的摄取牛皮塔的人才能生存！在那一点上，我知道我深深地，深深的doo doo，为我的生命中最大的争夺我的生命。</p><p>  They suggested I go back to the area where I had picked the mushrooms and get one to take with me for identification, then get myself to the local emergency room. I went back to the area and picked the one mushroom I had left because I thought it was  Amanita. I also took a piece of stem I had thrown into the garbage the night before.</p><p>  他们建议我回到我挑选蘑菇的地区，让一个人带着我识别，然后让自己到当地的急诊室。我回到了该地区，挑选了我离开的一个蘑菇，因为我以为它是amanita。我也拿了一块茎，我前一天晚上扔进了垃圾。</p><p> At this point, as long as I didn’t eat or drink anything I could get around. I had pretty much eliminated everything from my GI tract.</p><p> 在这一点上，只要我没有吃或喝任何东西，我都可以到处。我几乎从我的GI道中消灭了一切。</p><p> I got in my car to drive myself to the emergency room. Three thoughts went through my head as I prepared to leave:</p><p> 我进了我的车，让自己进入急诊室。当我准备离开时，三个想法经历了我的脑袋： </p><p> Should I go back into the house and say goodbye to my cats? My response: “No you idiot, you don’t have time for that!”</p><p>我应该回到家里，向我的猫说再见吗？我的回答：“不，你是白痴，你没有时间！”</p><p> If I didn’t have health insurance, would I go to the emergency room knowing I was just about to wipe out my cash reserve? Luckily I didn’t have to ponder that question as I had insurance and felt very fortunate. But what about someone who didn’t? Would they deny their symptoms and just consider it food poisoning? What would have been the end result? They probably would just start to feel better and then keel over from liver failure.  Amanita will fool you that way.</p><p> 如果我没有健康保险，我会去急诊室了解我即将消除现金储备吗？幸运的是，我没有思考那个问题，因为我有保险，感觉非常幸运。但那些没有的人呢？他们会否认他们的症状，只是考虑它的食物中毒吗？最终结果是什么？他们可能只是开始感觉更好，然后从肝脏失败中龙骨。艾美丽塔会这样欺骗你。</p><p> My last thought was “Take one last look around you, because you may never be back here again.” I did, and left without telling anyone where I was going.</p><p> 我的最后一个想法是“休息一下你，因为你可能永远不会再回到这里。”我做了，没有告诉任何人我要去的人。</p><p>  Wednesday, July 19th. I arrived at the ER of  Cayuga Medical Center about 9:15 a.m. I went in and walked straight up to the receptionist. She was on the phone with someone. She obviously was in a discussion with someone about some problem and it wasn’t going to be anytime soon that she could get off the phone. I waited patiently thinking, “I don’t want to make a scene.” Nevertheless, I didn’t understand why she couldn’t put the person on hold while she addressed a new emergency room client.Finally, around 9:30, she got off the phone and asked “What can I do for you?” I explained to her that I felt I had accidentally poisoned myself with some poisonous mushrooms. She asked whether my records were at the hospital. I said “yes.” She checked my name and found I indeed was registered and my insurance information was current. She asked me to be seated and informed me that someone would be with me shortly.</p><p>  19月19日星期三。我到了大约9点15分抵达Cayuga Medical Center的ER.我进去直奔接待员。她和某人在一起。她显然是与某人有关一些问题的讨论，她可以随时随地离开电话。我耐心地思考，“我不想开场地。”尽管如此，我不明白为什么她不能把这个人搁置在她发表新的急诊室客户端。最后，9:30左右，她下了电话并问道：“我能为你做些什么？”我向她解释说，我觉得我用一些有毒的蘑菇意外毒害了自己。她询问我的记录是否在医院。我说是。”她检查了我的名字，发现我确实被注册，我的保险信息是最新的。她让我坐下来告诉我，有人很快就会和我在一起。</p><p> I expected that someone would be out to see me within a minute or so since I had informed them that I suspected mushroom poisoning. Instead, time dragged on. I kept thinking, just stay calm and collected. Finally, after waiting another 20 minutes, someone came to get me.</p><p> 我期待有人会在一分钟内看到我，因为我告诉他们我怀疑蘑菇中毒。相反，时间拖了下来。我一直在思考，只是保持冷静和收集。最后，在等待20分钟后，有人来找我。</p><p> It’s amazing to me. Most people when they know they are dying think of what they didn’t do or what they should have done. In this case, all I could do was watch and monitor time like a hawk. My concern was I needed help NOW! ASAP! But, I also knew I needed to stay calm so as not to create a panic situation.</p><p> 对我来说是惊人的。当他们知道他们渴望的时候，大多数人都想想他们没有做的或应该做的事情。在这种情况下，我所能做的就是看起来像鹰一样的时间。我的担忧是我现在需要帮助！尽快！但是，我也知道我需要保持冷静，以免造成恐慌的局面。</p><p> I don’t remember much once I was admitted other than them taking vital signs and getting the info they needed regarding the poisoning and making sure that I was the only one involved. They kept me comfortable while someone took the mushroom to Cornell for identification. They started an IV to replenish my fluids.</p><p> 一旦我被其他人承认，我不记得了很多东西，而他们占据了重要的标志并让他们对中毒所需要的信息，并确保我是唯一一个所涉及的信息。当有人把蘑菇带到康奈尔识别时，他们让我舒服。他们开始了一个IV来补充我的液体。 </p><p> While waiting, I finally took the time to write down some phone numbers for people to call in case I didn’t make it. I also made a few more trips to the restroom.</p><p>在等待时，我终于花了时间写下一些电话号码，以便我打电话，以防我没有成功。我也越来越多地去洗手间。</p><p> The Emergency room staff came back saying a Cornell Mycologist (Kathie Hodge) had identified it. It was definitely  Amanita virosa mushroom poisoning. 1</p><p> 急诊室工作人员回来说康奈尔菌宫（Kathie Hodge）已经确定了它。它绝对是amanita virosa蘑菇中毒。 1</p><p> The first thing they did was make me drink a milk shake size container of charcoal. Have you ever seen a charcoal drink? It is as black as you can imagine. I often practice the Bates “palming” eye improvement exercise. During this exercise you rub your palms together, then place them over your eyes, and imagine the blackest black you can imagine. This was the blackest black I had ever seen! It was really hard to get past the thought and just drink it. It had a chalky flavor.</p><p> 他们所做的第一件事让我喝了一块奶昔尺寸的木炭容器。你有没有见过木炭饮料？它像你想象的那样黑色。我经常练习Bates“Palming”眼睛改善运动。在这个练习期间，你把你的手掌揉合在一起，然后把它们放在你的眼睛上，想象你可以想象的最黑暗的黑色。这是我见过的最黑的黑色！真的很难过去思考，只是喝它。它有一个垩味的味道。</p><p> About a half hour later. The ER staff informed me they had called Bang’s Ambulance and they were present, waiting to transport me to  Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, New York.</p><p> 大约半小时后。 er员工通知我，他们叫做爆炸的救护车，他们在场，等待将我运送到纽约罗切斯特的强烈纪念医院。</p><p> Needless to say, the charcoal drink did not stay down long. It would be at least another half hour before we left because I had to first go to the restroom to honor the vomiting reflex. My body was still reacting to anything put into my stomach and was rejecting the charcoal drink. It’s probably a good thing I made the ambulance crew wait and went to the bathroom when I did or I would have been upchucking in the ambulance all the way to Rochester.</p><p> 毋庸置疑，木炭饮料没有留下长期。在我们离开之前至少还有半小时，因为我必须先去洗手间才能​​纪念呕吐反射。我的身体仍然对进入我的胃部并拒绝木炭饮料的反应。这可能是一件好事，我让救护车船员在我做过或者我曾经一直到罗彻斯特一直坐在救护车中。</p><p> Before leaving, I also made a few phone calls; to work, letting them know what was going on and that I probably wasn’t going to be available to work the weekend, to my housemate, and to my girlfriend Julie. Then I was strapped in a gurney, loaded in the ambulance and on my to Rochester.</p><p> 在离开之前，我也拨打了一些电话;为了工作，让他们知道发生了什么，我可能不会将周末工作到我的室友，以及我的女朋友朱莉。然后我被绑在盖尼，装在救护车上，然后在我的罗切斯特。</p><p> The trip to Rochester from Ithaca was uneventful. The attending ambulance technician comforted me all the way. What I do remember the most was watching the clock above the rear doors. We left Ithaca around 3:00 p.m. in the afternoon and arrived at Strong Memorial in Rochester around 5:37 p.m.</p><p> 来自伊萨卡的罗切斯特的旅行是不行的。出席救护车技术人员一路安慰我。我记得最多的是在后门上看时钟。我们在下午3点左右离开了伊萨卡。下午，下午5:37左右抵达罗切斯特的强烈纪念馆。 </p><p> I was being sent to Strong Memorial because they had the only liver transplant unit in upstate New York. The treatment of choice is often liver transplantation. With early diagnosis, another experimental treatment includes massive doses of penicillin to stimulate the liver’s defenses. This was the treatment I would receive with the option to transplant if my liver failed.</p><p>我被送到强烈的纪念碑，因为他们在纽约州的唯一肝脏移植单位。选择的治疗通常是肝移植。随着早期诊断，另一种实验治疗包括巨大剂量的青霉素来刺激肝脏的防御。如果我的肝脏失败，这是我将通过移植的选择接受治疗。</p><p>  Upon our arrival at the Emergency Room, I was surprised to find they were ready to accept me without any paperwork. All the information about me had already been transmitted to them and I was admitted directly to the Emergency Room.The ER room there is impressive. It has a semicircular console area facing individual double occupancy booths. I was in the first one upon entering the ER room. I called Julie on my cell to let her know what had happened. She wanted to come up then, but, I insisted she wait till the next day. She insisted on letting my family know.</p><p>  在我们抵达急诊室后，我惊讶地发现他们已经准备好接受了我没有任何文书工作。关于我的所有信息已经传递给他们，我直接送到急诊室。呃房间令人印象深刻。它具有面向各个双人占用展位的半圆形控制台区域。进入OR房间时，我在第一个。我叫朱莉在我的牢房上让她知道发生了什么。她想上来，但是，我坚持要等到第二天。她坚持让我的家人知道。</p><p> I was having blood drawn every 2 hours to monitor the buildup of toxins in my liver and kidneys. They hooked me up to a transfusion stand and monitors. They were preparing to run me through all the tests they needed in order to prepare me for a transplant in case my liver failed. They were giving me huge dose of penicillin plus fluids to rehydrate me.</p><p> 我每2小时吸血，以监测肝脏和肾脏中的毒素的积累。他们把我挂在输血立场和监视器上。他们正准备通过他们所需要的所有测试来运行我，以便在我的肝脏失败时为移植准备我。他们给了我巨大的青霉素加液，以补充我。</p><p> Being sick as a dog with constant vomiting and diarrhea is no fun! I had a diaper on. I felt helpless. I felt humbled.</p><p> 作为持续呕吐和腹泻的狗生病并不好玩！我有一个尿布。我感到无助。我感到谦卑。</p><p> I was given a bed in the transplant unit. Taken for x-rays. Back to the room. Given a drink in order to do a CAT scan. It was a liter of pink liquid. I drank it in small amounts and even though they had given me something to shut down the vomiting, it just wasn’t working. Shortly after getting it all down, it came right back up. They gave me another liter. Again, I slowly started sipping an 8 oz glass every 15-20 minutes. Eventually, I almost got it all down and felt I could not drink another glass without vomiting again. They wheeled me down to the CAT scan machine and transferred me onto the bed that slides into the large instrument. As they started to roll me in, I yelled “Back me out, back me out! I’m going to throw up again!”</p><p> 我在移植单位上有一张床。采取X射线。回到房间。喝饮料以进行猫扫描。这是一升粉红色液体。我少量喝了它，即使他们给了我一些关闭呕吐的东西，它就不起作用了。在全部击球后不久，它就回来了。他们给了我另一升。同样，我慢慢地开始每15-20分钟啜饮8盎司的玻璃杯。最终，我几乎把它全部变坏了，觉得我不能再呕吐了另一个玻璃。他们将我转到猫扫描机上，然后将我转移到床上滑入大型乐器。当他们开始滚动我时，我大喊了“回到我，回到我吧！我要再呕吐了！“</p><p> They pulled me out of the cylinder and got me a bedpan just in time. I’m glad I didn’t ruin their large instrument puking inside it.</p><p> 他们把我拉出气缸，并恰好赶上了一个床单。我很高兴我没有破坏他们的大型乐器在它里面。</p><p> After the CAT scan, I was taken back to my room in the transplant unit. There was a constant droning sound that I couldn’t figure out and constant announcements over the PA system. It was really difficult sleeping with the noise and being awakened all the time for blood work. (They were drawing blood every 4 hours to monitor my liver and kidneys). It’s not a place conducive to good sleep. I just couldn’t get a decent nights sleep.</p><p> 在猫扫描之后，我被送回了移植单位。有一个持续的漂亮声音，我无法弄清楚并在PA系统上持续公告。噪音真的很难睡觉，一直觉得血液工作。 （他们每4小时吸血，以监测我的肝脏和肾脏）。这不是一个有利于睡眠的地方。我只是无法睡个好觉。 </p><p> My girlfriend Julie and my housemate Mark visited the next day. Julie had sent out an email to the dance community informing them of my situation, and had let my family know of my happenstance. Everyone was praying for me. My sister even had a bus load of kids praying for me while on their way to a youth conference in Colorado. All were worried about me. The focus was on me. I felt embarrassed. I had made a critical error in judgment and everyone knew about it.</p><p>我的女朋友朱莉和我的室友马克第二天访问过。朱莉已经向舞蹈社区发出了一封电子邮件，告知他们我的情况，让我的家人知道我的偶然。每个人都在为我祈祷。我的妹妹甚至在途中祈祷了我在科罗拉多州的青年会议上的途中为我祈祷。一切都担心我。重点是我。我感到尴尬。我在判决中提出了一个严重的错误，每个人都知道它。</p><p> Eileen, my friend who had first alerted me to my possible dilemma, saw the email and discussed it with her friends. One of them had just read about an alternative treatment. She went home at lunch and brought it to Eileen, who faxed it to the Doctors in Rochester. The doctors say they never received it.</p><p> 艾琳，我的朋友首先向我发出可能的困境，看到了电子邮件并与她的朋友讨论过。其中一个刚刚读过替代治疗。她在午餐时回家，把它带到了艾琳，他们将它传真给罗切斯特的医生。医生说他们从未收到过它。</p><p> The treatment uses Lipoic Acid. 3 It has also been shown to be useful in the treatment of liver problems such as hepatitis B and C, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholagitis. The article is from Dr Whitaker’s health newsletter Vol.16, No.7, p6.</p><p> 治疗使用硫辛酸。 3还证明可用于治疗肝炎和C，自身免疫性肝炎，原发性胆汁肝硬化和原发性胆管炎等肝脏问题。这篇文章来自Whitaker博士的健康时事通讯Vol.16，No.7，P6。</p><p> By now the doctors were coming around asking me questions in order to assess my mental capacity. If my liver went into failure, I would not be lucid. Without sleep, I found it hard to remember what day it was as everything seemed to blend into one long event.</p><p> 到目前为止，医生在询问我的问题，以评估我的心理能力。如果我的肝脏失败，我就不会被清醒。没有睡眠，我发现很难记住哪一天，因为一切似乎都融入了一个长的事件。</p><p> I work as an  accelerator operator in high energy physics and am an avid amateur dancer, a certified massage therapist and Hanna Somatic Educator. When they asked me about this and I told them, they thought I had lost my sanity. They had to ask Julie and Mark if I was telling them the truth. How many people do you know that earn their living as an accelerator operator?</p><p> 我作为高能量物理的加速器操作员，Am Avid Amateur Dancer，一位经过认证的按摩治疗师和汉娜躯体教育家。当他们问我这件事时，我告诉他们，他们以为我失去了理智。如果我告诉他们真相，他们不得不问朱莉和标记。你知道有多少人赚取他们作为加速器运营商的生活？</p><p> At one point a doctor came in and asked me “What is Pi?” I wasn’t quite sure how to respond as I didn’t know if he was asking about Pi, or pie. My question to him was “Which pi/pie, pi the mathematical term or pie the thing you eat?”</p><p> 在一点，医生进来并问我“什么是pi？”我不确定如何回应，因为他不知道他是否询问PI或派。我对他的问题是“你吃的东西的数学术语或馅饼是什么”哪个pi / pie，pi的数学术语或馅饼？“</p><p> His response, “Pi the mathematical term.” I proceeded to tell him about its relationship to a circle and its origins. I stumbled a little and thought maybe I really was losing my sanity.</p><p> 他的回应，“数学术语。”我继续告诉他与圈子及其起源的关系。我偶然发现了一点，想到也许我真的正在失去理智。 </p><p> Thursday, Julie was with me most of the day. I was taken for tests of my cardiovascular system. The stress test. They had to do it chemically as I was unable to do it physically on the treadmill. A friend from my mediation group visited, who ironically worked with the wife of the transplant surgeon, Dr. Peter Abt.</p><p>星期四，朱莉大部分时间都在和我在一起。我被拍摄了我的心血管系统的测试。压力测试。他们必须在化学上进行化学，因为我无法在跑步机上身体上没有。来自我的调解小组的朋友访问，他讽刺地与移植外科医生的妻子一起工作，彼得阿比博士。</p><p> Thursday evening they took me into intensive care. Before wheeling me into intensive care, Dr Abt visited me. I had to sign papers giving Julie power of attorney etc. He informed me they were ready to give me a transplant if I needed it. I remember grabbing the cross on my neck chain and praying silently to myself, “Dear Lord, let me keep my liver. I do not want to live with someone else’s liver the rest of my life and have to deal with the medical expenses to keep my body from rejecting it.”</p><p> 星期四晚上他们带我进入重症照顾。在将我转向重症监护之前，Abt博士拜访了我。我不得不签署一篇关于审理律师的朱莉力量的论文。如果我需要它，他就会准备好送给我移植。我记得抓住脖子链上的十字架，默默地祈祷，“亲爱的主，让我保持肝脏。我不想与别人的肝脏住在一起，并必须处理医疗费用，让我的身体拒绝它。“</p><p> I had put my fate in the hands of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The  23rd psalm was running through my mind as well. The Sunday morning meditation group I attend had just recited it the previous Sunday.</p><p> 我把我的命运放在了我的主和救主耶稣基督的手中。 23篇诗篇在我的脑海中运行。周日早上冥想小组我参加刚刚在上一个星期天刚刚登记。</p><p> The thought that these guys might be trying to get my liver for someone else did cross my mind. I let it go. Instead, I did a visualization exercise. I imagined my liver. I saw the color black (it should have been green). My kidneys, ocean blue. I smiled to both of them. (For more info on visualization, I recommend you read “ Awaken the Healing Light of the Tao” by Mantak and Maneewan Chia.)</p><p> 认为这些人可能试图为别人抓住我的肝脏做了我的思想。我放手了。相反，我做了可视化练习。我想象着我的肝脏。我看到了黑色（它应该是绿色的）。我的肾脏，海蓝。我对两个人都笑了笑。 （有关可视化的更多信息，我建议您通过Mantak和Maneewan Chia读取“唤醒Tao的治疗光线”。）</p><p> Somehow, in the middle of the night my liver numbers peaked and started coming down. I wasn’t out of the woods yet, but it looked like I was going to recover without a liver transplant. I was wheeled back to my room in the liver transplant unit Friday morning.</p><p> 不知何故，在半夜，我的肝脏数字尖顶并开始下来。我还没有走出树林，但看起来我要恢复没有肝脏移植。星期五早上，我在肝脏移植单位上回到了我的房间。</p><p> Members of my family visited that day: Jim, my oldest brother, Tim and his wife Kim, and my baby sister Betty Sue. They brought flowers and balloons wishing me well and a happy birthday balloon as my birthday was coming up. We all held hands and my sister in law, Kim, prayed for my recovery. I was also receiving prayers and get well wishes from the dance community.</p><p> 我家的成员访问了那天：吉姆，我最古老的兄弟，蒂姆和他的妻子金，我的宝贝妹妹贝蒂苏。他们带来了鲜花和气球，祝我好运，生日快乐气球，因为我的生日即将来临。我们都牵着手和我的嫂子，金，为我的康复祈祷。我也接受了祈祷，并从舞蹈社区那里得到祝福。</p><p> All along, I had hoped to be out of the hospital by Friday to work my weekend shift. All along, the doctors told me I was going to be there for a while. It was clear I wasn’t getting out Friday.</p><p> 一路走来，我希望在周五离开医院，以便在周末转变工作。一路走来，医生告诉我，我会在那里一段时间。很明显，我没有星期五出去。 </p><p> My liver and kidneys had taken a big insult, as had my gastrointestinal tract. Although my liver numbers were coming down, the kidney numbers still hadn’t peaked. I would be in the hospital another week to make sure I would not need kidney dialysis.</p><p>我的肝脏和肾脏造成了大部分侮辱，因为我的胃肠道。虽然我的肝脏数量下降，但肾脏数字仍然没有达到顶峰。我会在医院里再一周，以确保我不需要肾脏透析。</p><p> They took the tube out of my nose going to my stomach on Friday. It had been quite annoying as it gave me the hiccups. I could almost predict when the next one would come along. It was that periodic. Even after removing the tube, the hiccups lingered for another couple hours.</p><p> 他们星期五将管子从鼻子中拿出来。它一直很烦人，因为它给了我打嗝。我几乎可以预测下一个人会出现。这是定期的。即使在去除管后，打嗝也会徘徊在另一个小时。</p><p> By Sunday, all the tubes in me had been removed. Julie was there for me as well. She got me out of bed that evening and we took a short walk around the nurses’ station. We did a little salsa together. I was dancing again! The nurses applauded.</p><p> 星期天，我的所有管道已被删除。朱莉也在我身边。那天晚上她把我从床上拿出来，在护士站散步。我们一起做了一点莎莎。我再次跳舞！护士鼓掌。</p><p> I still found it hard to sleep. Now, at least, they were only drawing blood every 4 hours. That night another patient was in my room who was there to receive a transplant. He was constantly yelling out for help from the nurses.</p><p> 我仍然难以入睡。现在，至少，他们每4小时只画血。那天晚上，另一名病人在我的房间里有接受移植的房间。他经常出去寻求护士的帮助。</p><p> Sunday night/Monday morning I finally fell into a deep dream sleep. I saw a white church glistening in white light. A power cord glowing red was feeding power to keep it lit up. I was riding in a black limo and sparks flew from behind the car as we drove over the power cord. The next thing I knew, I was next to my grandfather’s grave. I was wondering why I was there when I was awakened by the nurse for another blood sample.</p><p> 星期天晚上/星期一早上我终于陷入了深深的梦想睡眠状态。我看到一个白色的教堂闪闪发光的白光。电源线发光红色正在喂养电源以保持它的亮起。当我们开车在电源线上时，我骑着黑色的豪华轿车，火花从车后面飞行。我知道的下一件事，我旁边是我祖父的坟墓。我想知道为什么当我被护士被另一种血液样本唤醒时，我在那里。</p><p> When people ask me whether I had any near-death experiences, I usually relay my dream to them. I am here by the grace of God! I feel so lucky and yet fortunate. I found out that of three people admitted in 2006 to Strong Memorial with  Amanita poisoning, I am the only one to have survived; 66% died.</p><p> 当人们向我询问我是否有任何近死经历时，我通常将梦想中的梦想传递给他们。我是上帝的恩典！我觉得很幸运，但幸运的是。我发现，在2006年录取的三个人到了强烈的纪念amanita中毒，我是唯一一个幸存的人; 66％死亡。</p><p> Why did I live and the rest not live? Was it the amount of toxin? Was it that I knew what had happened to me and sought care and help quickly? Was it my meditation/visualization and somatic self care/self help practice? Was it the prayers of my friends and family and my faith? Was it the doctors’ care? One of them said it was a miracle!</p><p> 为什么我生活，其余的不居住？是毒素的数量吗？是我知道我发生了什么事，并迅速寻求护理和帮助吗？是我的冥想/可视化和躯体自我照顾/自助练习吗？是我朋友和家人的祈祷和我的信仰吗？是医生的关心吗？其中一个人说这是一个奇迹！ </p><p> Simply said, I don’t know that it was any individual thing, but a combination of everything.</p><p>简单地说，我不知道这是任何个人的东西，而是一切的组合。</p><p> Monday, July 24th was my birthday. I could not have received a better gift than the gift of life. Throughout my life, I have been traumatized. I was born a blue baby, fell out of a silo at the age of 12, etc. I could go on, but the important thing is, I am a survivor. I love cats–maybe I have nine lives!</p><p> 星期一，7月24日是我的生日。我无法收到比生命的礼物更好的礼物。在我的生活中，我被创伤了。我出生了一个蓝色的宝贝，在12岁时掉了一个筒仓等等，我可以继续，但重要的是，我是幸存者。我喜欢猫 - 也许我有九个生命！</p><p> How did I get in such a mess? In retrospect, I considered the possibility that I had subconsciously poisoned myself. But in reality, the mistake I made was just  not taking the time to positively identify the mushrooms I had picked before ingesting them.</p><p> 我是怎么犯了这样的混乱的？回想起来，我认为我潜意识地毒害自己的可能性。但实际上，我所犯的错误只是没有花时间积极识别我在摄取他们之前选择的蘑菇。</p><p> Most victims of life-threatening mushroom poisoning in North America are people from Southeast Asia; Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Viet Nam. They apparently mistake  Amanita for edible “Paddy-Straw” ( Volvariella volvacea) mushrooms. The two are similar in several ways; cap color, size, and the white “cup” around the base of the stalk, but different in others (for example, the Paddy-Straw has a pink spore print, the  Amanita*, a white spore print; and the  Amanita* has a partial veil). The Paddy Straw mushroom occurs in tropical and temperate areas worldwide, and is especially common in Southeast Asia; the  Amanita, alas, does not occur in Southeast Asia, so folks from that part of the world are unaware of the lethal “look-alike.”</p><p> 北美的大多数危及生命的蘑菇中毒的受害者是来自东南亚的人;老挝，柬埔寨，泰国，越南。他们显然误认为是可食用的“稻草”（Volvariella Volvacea）蘑菇的氨基塔。这两个以多种方式类似;帽子颜色，尺寸和白色“杯子”围绕茎秆，但不同于其他（例如，稻草有一个粉红色的孢子印刷，amanita *，白色孢子打印;和amanita *有部分面纱）。稻草蘑菇在全球热带和温带地区发生，在东南亚特别普遍;艾美欢迎，唉，在东南亚不会发生，所以世界上那部分的人都没有意识到致命的“看起来”。</p><p> Millions of North Americans pick and eat wild mushrooms every year, without as much as a belly ache.</p><p> 数百万北美人每年挑选野生蘑菇，没有像腹部疼痛一样。</p><p> Are they “experts?” Yes! At least, they are experts on the edible wild</p><p> 他们是“专家？”是的！至少，他们是可食用野生的专家</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.mycology.cornell.edu/2006/11/22/i-survived-the-destroying-angel/">https://blog.mycology.cornell.edu/2006/11/22/i-survived-the-destroying-angel/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/下来/">#下来</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
