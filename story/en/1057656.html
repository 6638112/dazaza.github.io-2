This was reported in a new study from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. This research does not show that metals and minerals are a direct cause of ADHD or autism because observed associations may have other explanations; however, the findings show the importance of more knowledge about how environmental contaminants may impact fetal development.    Environmental contaminants can impact children&#39;s development even in the mother&#39;s womb. Several   such as lead, mercury, arsenic, and cadmium are known or suspected to interfere with brain development and can reach the fetus through the placenta. This is also the case for minerals such as manganese, selenium, and copper, which in sufficient doses are important for a normal fetal brain development, while levels that are too low or too high can potentially be harmful. The research question in this study was whether any of these substances could increase risk for ADHD or   in children. There are few studies that have investigated metals and minerals during fetal life and associations with ADHD or autism in children.</p><p>重质金属镉，铅和砷的水平和孕妇血液中的孕产妇血液中的基本矿物锰与儿童ADHD和/或自闭症的风险增加有关。这是挪威公共卫生研究所的一项新研究报告。这项研究并没有表明金属和矿物质是ADHD或自闭症的直接原因，因为观察到的协会可能有其他解释;然而，调查结果表明了更多了解环境污染物如何影响胎儿发育的知识的重要性。即使在母亲＆＃39; sombb中，环境污染物也会影响儿童＆＃39。几种如铅，汞，砷和镉是已知的或怀疑干扰脑发育并且可以通过胎盘到达胎儿。这也是矿物质，如锰，硒和铜的情况，其足够剂量对于正常的胎儿脑发育是重要的，而过低或过高的水平可能可能是有害的。本研究中的研究问题是任何这些物质是否可能会增加ADHD或儿童的风险。很少有研究在胎儿生命和患者和儿童自闭症中的胎儿生命和关联期间研究过的研究。</p><p>  Heavy metals and minerals were measured in maternal blood during pregnancy in 2136 mothers from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), where 705 children had an ADHD diagnosis, 397 had an autism diagnosis, and 1034 did not have a diagnosis. The study showed that levels of some of the heavy metals and minerals were associated with increased risk of ADHD, autism or both diagnoses. In some cases, both high and low levels in maternal blood were associated with increased risk, compared to normal levels. This study also took into consideration other factors that could be associated with   and mineral exposures and developmental diagnoses, like maternal education, age, parity, seafood consumption, smoking and child sex and birth year.</p><p>  在挪威母亲，父亲队队（Moba）的2136名母亲中，在怀孕期间在孕产妇和矿物质测量了重金属和矿物质，其中705名儿童诊断，397名患有自闭症诊断，1034人没有诊断。该研究表明，一些重金属和矿物质的水平与ADHD，闭神或两种诊断的风险增加有关。在某些情况下，与正常水平相比，母体血液中的高和低水平与风险增加有关。本研究还考虑了其​​他可能与矿物暴露和发育诊断有关的其他因素，如产妇教育，年龄，平价，海产品消费，吸烟和儿童性和诞生年。</p><p>  Even after considering these other factors, there was increased risk of autism diagnosis with both the highest and the lowest levels of lead in maternal blood, in addition to increased risk with elevated levels of arsenic. For ADHD, there was an increased risk of diagnosis with both low and high levels of arsenic. The highest levels of cadmium were associated with increased risk of both ADHD and autism, compared to the lowest levels.</p><p>  即使在考虑到这些其他因素之后，除了增加砷水平升高的风险外，孕产妇血液中的最高和最低铅均有最高和最低水平的患者的风险。对于ADHD，具有较低和高水平的砷的诊断风险增加。与最低水平相比，最高水平的镉与ADHD和自闭症的风险增加有关。</p><p>     Children of mothers with both low and high levels of manganese had increased risk of ADHD. Among children of mothers with the highest levels of manganese (compared to the lowest), there was increased risk of autism.</p><p>     母亲患有低和高水平的锰的母亲的风险增加了ADHD的风险。在母亲水平最高的母亲的儿童中（与最低）相比，自闭症的风险增加。</p><p>  Most people, including pregnant women and the unborn children, are exposed to thousands of chemicals. Still, we know surprisingly little about how this can impact the fetal brain development. We need more research to gain knowledge about causal relationships between   and brain development, says Thea Skogheim and Gro Villanger, two of the researchers of the study.</p><p>  大多数人，包括孕妇和未出生的孩子，都暴露在数千种化学物质。尽管如此，我们仍然对如何影响胎儿脑发育来令人惊讶的是。研究人员的研究人员，我们需要更多的研究，以获得有关与大脑发展之间的因果关系和大脑发展的知识。</p><p>  It is important to emphasize that the associations that were found in the study are on a group level and that factors that were not included may have affected the results. Thus, one cannot claim that these metals and minerals is a direct cause of ADHD and autism. There are many different factors that contribute to the development of these disorders, where particularly heredity is important. Yet, there is likely a complex interplay between genes and environmental factors, such as environmental contaminants.</p><p>  重要的是要强调，研究中发现的协会是在群体层面上，并且不包括的因素可能影响了结果。因此，人们不能声称这些金属和矿物质是ADHD和自闭症的直接原因。有许多不同的因素有助于发展这些疾病，特别是遗传是重要的。然而，基因和环境因素之间可能具有复杂的相互作用，例如环境污染物。</p><p>    Previous studies in this field have mainly focused on the most known and toxic heavy metals, such as lead and mercury. They have also based their research more on parent-reported ADHD symptoms in the children than on register-based diagnoses. The findings in this study support results from similar studies from other countries. However, this study is among the first that have investigated 11 different metals and minerals together with ADHD and autism diagnoses. The exposures were investigated both individually and as mixtures.</p><p>    此领域的先前研究主要集中在最着名和有毒的重金属，如铅和汞。它们还基于他们在儿童父母报告的ADHD症状的研究中，而不是基于寄存器的诊断。这项研究中的调查结果支持来自其他国家的类似研究。然而，本研究是第一个调查了11种不同的金属和矿物质，以及ADHD和自闭症诊断。曝光是单独和混合物进行研究的。 </p><p>  Toxic heavy metals such as mercury, lead, arsenic, and cadmium are naturally occurring in the environment, but due to   such as pollution from industry and mining, there are elevated levels in the environment. According to the Norwegian Environment Agency, the use of lead ammunition is the greatest source (67%) of emission of lead in the environment in Norway. Both natural occurrence and emission from industry to soil and water leads to food being the greatest source of metals and minerals. Some of the substances (mercury, lead, cadmium) accumulate in the food chain and can be transferred from mother to child during pregnancy.</p><p>毒性重金属如汞，铅，砷和镉在环境中自然地发生，但由于诸如行业和采矿的污染，环境中有升高。据挪威环境局介绍，利用铅弹药是挪威环境中铅排放的最大来源（67％）。自然发生和来自工业的土壤和水的排放都导致食物是最大的金属和矿物质。一些物质（汞，铅，镉）积聚在食物链中，可以在怀孕期间从母亲转移到孩子。</p><p>  Lead and cadmium are found in many of the food items that we most frequently ingest, such as grain products and vegetables, in addition to beverages. There are elevated levels of cadmium in organ meat (kidney and liver) and brown crab meat. Cigarettes are also an important source of cadmium.</p><p>  除饮料外，我们最常摄取的许多食品中发现了铅和镉。器官肉（肾脏和肝脏）和棕色蟹肉中有升高的镉。香烟也是镉的重要来源。</p><p>  Families that have game meat as part of their daily diet get additionally exposed to lead, combined with the exposure from other food products. According to warnings from the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, young, pregnant, and breastfeeding women as well as children below the age of seven, should not eat game meat that is shot with lead ammunition.</p><p>  作为他们的日常饮食的一部分具有游戏肉的家庭另外暴露于铅，与其他食品的暴露相结合。根据挪威食品安全管理局的警告，年轻，怀孕和母乳喂养女性以及七岁以下的儿童，不应该吃铅弹药的游戏肉。</p><p>  There are particular warnings from the Norwegian Food Safety Authority about the intake of seafood from polluted areas in Norway (ports, fjords and lakes). The population is exposed to arsenic mainly through food and drinks, and in Norway fish and seafood are one of the greatest sources. In fish and seafood most of the arsenic are organic forms that are considered less toxic than inorganic forms. Both human and animal studies have shown harmful effects on the nervous system following exposure to inorganic forms.</p><p>  挪威食品安全机构特别警告关于从挪威污染地区的海鲜摄入（港口，峡湾和湖泊）。人口主要通过食品和饮料来暴露于砷，在挪威鱼和海鲜是最伟大的来源之一。在鱼类和海鲜大部分砷是有机形式，被认为比无机形式更少。人类和动物研究都对暴露于无机形式后的神经系统已经显示出有害影响。</p><p>  Even though manganese is essential for many biochemical processes in the body, excessive levels over a long period of time can also be harmful, especially for the brain and nervous system. The greatest human exposure source is food (grain products, green vegetables, nuts) and multivitamin supplements. Additionally, exposure can occur through cosmetics, drinking water, air pollution, and occupational sources. In the Norwegian population, there are some occupational groups working with metals that are exposed to high levels of manganese. In areas of the world with high levels of manganese in the soil and groundwater (such as drinking water) or where mining contributes to high air concentrations, studies have shown associations with behavioral problems, cognitive deficits, reduced learning abilities, and lower school performance in children.</p><p>  尽管锰对身体中许多生化过程至关重要，但长时间的过度水平也可能是有害的，特别是对于大脑和神经系统。最伟大的人类曝光来源是食品（粮食产品，绿色蔬菜，坚果）和多种维生素补充剂。此外，通过化妆品，饮用水，空气污染和职业来源可能发生暴露。在挪威人口中，有一些职业群体与暴露于高水平锰的金属合作。在世界上具有高水平的土壤和地下水（如饮用水）的世界地区或采矿贡献高空气浓度，研究表明了与行为问题，认知缺陷，学习能力减少和降低学校表现的关联孩子们。</p><p>    This study includes children born between 2002 and 2009. There is, however, limited knowledge about present day levels of exposure. Even though bans and regulations for some of the heavy metals (e.g. mercury and lead) have been implemented, many metals are transported through air and ocean currents across the globe. Thus, we do not know the levels of metals and other environmental contaminants in the Norwegian population as of today, nor in vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and children. It is therefore important that we gain more knowledge about this, says Skogheim and Villanger.</p><p>    本研究包括在2002年至2009年期间出生的儿童。然而，有关当今暴露水平的知识有限。尽管已经实施了一些重金属（例如汞和铅）的禁令和法规，但许多金属通过全球空气和海洋电流运输。因此，我们不知道迄今为止挪威人口的金属和其他环境污染物的水平，也不知道孕妇和儿童等弱势群体。因此，斯科府和维尔兰杰说，我们非常重要。</p><p>    The Norwegian health authorities estimates that about 3–5 percent of children and youth below the age of 18 have ADHD. This entails that on average, there is one child with ADHD in each school class. In Norway, around 1 percent of all children will have received a diagnosis of autism by the age of eight years. By discovering potential environmental risk factors that contribute to ADHD and autism, this can support and initiate preventive measures.</p><p>    挪威卫生当局估计，约3-5％的儿童和青少年低于18岁的adhd。这需要平均，每个学校课程都有一个adhd。在挪威，大约1％的儿童将在八年的岁月内接受自闭症的诊断。通过发现潜在的环境风险因素，为ADHD和自闭症做出了贡献，这可以支持和启动预防措施。 </p><p>  The study is published in the journal  Environment International.
