I have moved on with my life, and it looks like they did, too, likely before they even looked at my query.\n  Small and medium-sized businesses aren\u2019t a big fan of banks, either. If you operate an early-stage startup, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess if you will ever be able to convince a bank to issue you a corporate account. So of course, startups \u2014 Razorpay and Open \u2014 took it upon themselves to fix this experience.\n For consumers, too, in recent years, scores of startups have arrived on the scene to improve this banking experience. Whether  you are a teenager, or  just out of college, or a working professional, or  don\u2019t have a credit score, there are firms that can get you a credit card and loan.\n But even these services have a ceiling limit of some sort. And customers aren\u2019t loyal to any startup.\n \u201cA customer\u2019s relationship is always with the entity where they park their savings deposit,\u201d said  Jitendra Gupta, a high-profile entrepreneur who has spent a decade in the fintech world. Since these customers are not parking their money with fintech, \u201cthe startups have been unable to disrupt the bank. That\u2019s the hard reality.\u201d\n So what\u2019s the alternative? Gupta, who co-founded CitrusPay (sold to  Naspers\u2019 PayU) and served as managing director of PayU, has been thinking about these challenges for more than two years.\n \u201cIf you really want to change the banking industry, you cannot operate from the side. You have to fight from the centre, where they deposit their money. It\u2019s a very time-consuming process and requires a lot of initial capital and experience with banks,\u201d he told TechCrunch in an interview.\n After more than a year and a half of raising about $24 million \u2014 from Sequoia Capital India, 3one4 Capital,  Amrish Rau,  Kunal Shah,  Kunal Bahl, Tanglin Venture Partners, Rainmatter and others \u2014 Gupta is ready to launch what he believes will address a lot of the issues individuals face with their banks.\n His new startup, called  Jupiter, wants to bring \u201cdelight\u201d to the banking experience, and it will launch in India on Thursday.\n \u201cWe believe that a bank account should be a smart account, where it gives you insight, shares personalized tips and guides you through attaining some financial discipline,\u201d he said.\n  To be sure, Jupiter, too, will offer loans and other financial services to customers. But instead of making irrelevant calls to customers, it will assess which of its customers are running short on money and give the option to take a credit line from its app itself, he said. \u201cThe upsell doesn\u2019t need to happen by way of spam. It needs to happen by way of contextualization and personalization.\u201d\n \u201cJupiter has been built in a deep integration with the underlying bank, allowing the consumer to have a frictionless experience for all their banking needs,\u201d said Amrish Rau, chief executive of Pine Labs, co-founder of CitrusPay and longtime friend of Gupta.\n The startup, which employs 115 people, has developed a number of products for customers joining on day one. The products include the ability to buy now and pay later on UPI, a feature first offered in the market by Jupiter, and a mutual fund portfolio analyzer. A debit card, in-app chat with a customer service agent, expense categorisation, finding the right card, determining the existing health insurance coverage, and more are ready to ship, the startup said.\n Jupiter is currently working on providing zero mark-up on forex transactions, and frictionless two-factor authentication. The startup has  published a public Trello page where it has outlined the features it is working on and when it expects to ship them, as well as features suggested by its beta-testing customers. \u201cI want to establish full transparency in what we are working on to build trust with customers,\u201d said Gupta.\n Jupiter will have its own customer relationship team that will engage with the startup\u2019s users. The startup, which last month opened a waiting list for customers to sign up, had amassed more than 25,000 applications as of two weeks ago.\n Even Jupiter, which one day wishes to disrupt the banking sector, currently has to partner with banks. Its partners are Federal Bank and Axis Bank.\n I asked Gupta about the excitement his investors see in Jupiter. \u201cEveryone believes, as you see with fintech giants such as Nubank globally, that we will become a full bank,\u201d he said.\n But for the time being, Gupta said he is not looking to partner with more banks. \u201cI don\u2019t want Jupiter to attract customers because they want to bank with Federal or Axis. I want them to come to Jupiter because they want to bank with Jupiter,\u201d he said.\n In the next 12 months, the startup hopes to serve more than 1 million customers.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 09:19:01", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "jitendra,veteran,\u94f6\u884c", "title": "Fintech Veteran Jitendra Gupta\u5df2\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u4e3a\u4ed6\u7684\u65b0\u5c40 - \u73b0\u5728\u4ed6\u6b63\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u94f6\u884c\u8ffd\u968f ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tFintech veteran Jitendra Gupta is ready for his new inning \u2014 now he is going after banks in India\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/jiten-gupta-jupiter-launch/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["jitendra", "veteran", "\u94f6\u884c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "6361d67daf86c2f1041c852802602933.png", "infoid": 1067330, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u867d\u7136\u5728\u51e1\u4eba\u6218\u6597\u4e2d\u8f7b\u677e\u6253\u8d25\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7136\u4e3a\u8b66\u5bdf\u5236\u9020\u90a3\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u72d7\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u5df2\u7ecf\u7531\u6c7d\u8f66\u516c\u53f8\u73b0\u4ee3\u8d2d\u4e70\u3002\n    \u6839\u636e\u73b0\u4ee3\u65b0\u95fb\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u52a8\u6001\u4ef7\u503c\u4e3a11\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u5373\u6089\u8fbe\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u4eba\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u516c\u53f8\u4e2d\u5360\u636e\u4e8680\uff05\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u80a1\u6743\u3002\u8f6f\u94f6\u884c\u5c06\u4fdd\u755920\uff05\u7684\u80a1\u4efd\u3002\u57282017\u5e74\u8f6f\u94f6\u6536\u8d2d\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4ee5\u524d\u7531Google\uff06\uff0339;\u7236\u6bcd\u516c\u53f8\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u62e5\u6709\u3002\n  \u5f88\u96be\u544a\u8bc9\u73b0\u4ee3\u5e0c\u671b\u4ece\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u4e2d\u8131\u79bb\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u8f7d\u6709Technobabble\u7684\u3002\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u65b0\u9c9c\u4e8b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u4ee3\u4eba\u58eb\u8868\u793a\u6536\u8d2d\u662f\uff06\uff0334;\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u8fc8\u5411\u667a\u80fd\u79fb\u52a8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\uff06\uff0334;\u5982\uff06\uff0334;\u81ea\u4e3b\u9a7e\u9a76\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AI\uff09\uff0c\u57ce\u5e02\u7a7a\u79fb\uff08UAM\uff09\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u5de5\u5382\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u8fd9\u4f3c\u4e4e\u4e0e\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u91ce\u5fc3\u4ea4\u8c08\u3002\u8d85\u8d8a\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u7684\u91ce\u5fc3\u3002\u73b0\u4ee3\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u5e0c\u671b\uff06\uff0334;\u5236\u5b9a\u589e\u5f3a\u4eba\u6c11\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u751f\u547d\u548c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u6027\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\n  \u663e\u7136\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff06\uff0334;\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5b83\u7684\u5c11\u5f97\u591a\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e86\u795d\u8d2d\u4e70\uff0cHyundai\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u53ea\u5947\u5f02\u7684\u7092\u4f5c\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u53ea\u770b\u7740\u773c\u775b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u72d7\u7684\u62a4\u58eb\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u72d7\uff0c\u4e00\u53ea\u5e26\u6709\u5e73\u677f\u7535\u8111\u7684\u62a4\u58eb\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u72d7\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u60a3\u8005\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u5730\u65b9\u7684\u533b\u751f\u70b9\u5934\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u8df3\u821e\u5728\u8857\u4e0a\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002\u6362\u53e5\u8bdd\u8bf4\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u51dd\u805a\u529b\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u5b64\u72ec\u7684\u672a\u6765\uff0c\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u5207\u90fd\u7cdf\u7cd5\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u6709\u4eba\u60f3\u8981\u4e00\u53ea\u770b\u5230\u773c\u775b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u72d7\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u72d7\u8d85\u8d8a\u7406\u89e3\u3002\n  \u4ec0\u4e48\uff06\uff0339;\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u52a8\u6001\uff06\uff0339;\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u72d7\uff06\uff0339;\u6700\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u662f\u516c\u53f8\u603b\u90e8\u7684\u62a4\u536b\u72ac\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8b66\u5bdf\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e0\u5bb6\u53ef\u5f52\u8005\u8425\u5730\u7684\u7f3a\u70b9\u5de1\u903b\u5458\u3002\u672c\u524d\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e0d\u5728\u5e7f\u544a\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5448\u73b0\u3002 ", "note_en": "Boston Dynamics, the company that makes   those dystopian dancing robot dogs that also   work for the cops despite being   easily defeatable in mortal combat, has been purchased by the car company Hyundai.\n    The deal values Boston Dynamics at $1.1 billion, according to   a Hyundai press release, and sees Hyundai assume an 80 percent controlling stake in the robot company. Softbank will retain a 20 percent stake. Before the Softbank acquisition in 2017, the company was previously owned by Google&#39;s parent company Alphabet.\n  It is hard to tell what Hyundai wants out of Boston Dynamics from the press release, which is laden with technobabble. Robots in car manufacturing are nothing new, but Hyundai says the acquisition is &#34;another major step toward its strategic transformation into a Smart Mobility Solution Provider&#34; such as &#34;autonomous driving, artificial intelligence (AI), Urban Air Mobility (UAM), smart factories and robots,&#34; which seems to speak to the company&#39;s ambitions beyond car manufacturing. Hyundai says it hopes to &#34;develop advanced technologies that enhance people&#39;s lives and promote safety, thereby realizing the progress for humanity.&#34;\n  Apparently, the &#34;progress of humanity&#34; means a lot less of it. To celebrate the purchase, Hyundai released   a bizarre hype video featuring a seeing-eye robot dog, a nurse robot dog with a tablet mounted on its head that allows the patient to nod at a doctor who is somewhere else, and a teen dancing with a robot in the street. In other words, Hyundai envisions a lonely future in which social cohesion between humans has broken down and robots are our only friends. That&#39;s all bad enough, but why anyone would want a seeing eye robot dog instead of a real dog is beyond comprehension.\n  What&#39;s important to remember is that some of Boston Dynamics&#39; robot dogs&#39; most notable implementations are as guard dogs at   corporate headquarters, as police tools, and as dystopian patrollers of homeless encampments.

These companies\u2019 market capitalizations, as of May 6 of this year, range from $2.8 billion (Yelp) to $2.1 trillion (Apple); our financial data is current as of June 14.\n Thirty-seven technology giants responded to our queries and agreed to participate in the project. Stripe and Roku declined to participate, and Tesla, SpaceX, and Coinbase did not respond to repeated requests. For companies that did not participate, we searched for any public information about commitments or policy changes, and included those findings in the final project.\n Pieces of this data set, which encapsulates the public financial commitments made by these companies, as well as the changes made to their policies and procedures in the last year, are highlighted in data visualizations, which you can see  here. But it\u2019s worth unpacking this data more.\n  One of the biggest trends in tech over the last year is financial commitments to improving racial equity both within individual tech companies\u2019 walls, as well as across the country at large. While some companies have made commitments to racial justice and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) before, it has never happened collectively on the same scale it did in 2020. Notably, after police killed Michael Brown Jr. in Ferguson in 2014, no major tech companies  made any statements or donations (though Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey, who was executive chairman at the time, did tweet about it and attended the protests in person).\n Cumulatively, the tech giants we surveyed have committed a total of $3.8 billion toward DEI in 2020 and 2021, in various forms. The largest chunk of these funds\u2014$2.9 billion, or 75%\u2014have gone toward initiatives that support Black-owned businesses. That includes venture capital funding deployed specifically toward Black founders, as well as funds earmarked for Black-owned suppliers.\n Eleven percent of the commitments, a total of $422.5 million, is going toward racial justice organizations, often taking the form of direct donations to nonprofits. About 10% of the commitments, $375.1 million, were committed to educational initiatives. These sorts of commitments are sometimes framed as an effort to solve the  \u201cpipeline problem\u201d\u2014the  often-contested\u00a0claim that tech\u2019s diversity woes are due to a lack of qualified Black people to hire. The remaining money has been allocated to undesignated or internal commitments; very few companies shared their internal DEI spend. In addition, a few companies, including Microsoft, Netflix, and Yelp, included loans and deposits into Black-owned banks as part of their commitments.\n  While these numbers seem substantial, it\u2019s important to compare companies\u2019 commitments to their operating income. We took a look at companies which answered our survey that had an operating income of over $100 million in 2020, and analyzed how many days it would take for their profits to surpass their total commitments to racial equity. The results were stark.\n Apple, which committed $100 million, will make that money in profit in less than a day. But even the largest tech companies that committed substantially more\u2014like Microsoft ($772.5 million), Alphabet/Google ($418 million), and Facebook ($347 million)\u2014make their commitments back in profit in between three and six days.\n There are some standouts on the list. PayPal, which made $3.3 billion in operating income in 2020, would take almost two months of profit to pay for its substantial $535 million commitment. In addition, Salesforce, which made $422 million in operating income in 2020, has committed the vast majority of it\u2014$402.2 million\u2014to various diversity and equity initiatives.\n  These comparisons reveal how companies\u2019 financial commitments are best understood in the context of how much money they make; even some of the largest dollar amounts begin to look small in this context. As surveillance expert Chris Gilliard  puts it, \u201ci t\u2019s not even couch-cushion money to them.\u201d\n  Along with asking companies about their financial commitments to equity, we also asked them a range of questions about their policies that can indicate a company is attempting to improve its DEI. (It\u2019s important to note that not all policy changes are equal. Critics have suggested that some moves, like making Juneteenth a holiday, don\u2019t result in a systemic change to company culture).\n One movement that\u2019s taken place is a push to bring more Black people on to boards of directors, and we found this reflected in the data. While 71% of companies surveyed currently have a Black board member, 37% of those companies appointed their first Black board member in 2020 or 2021. Twenty-nine percent of companies surveyed do not currently have a Black board member.\n  We found that tech companies are split on requiring anti-bias or anti-racism training. According to our survey, 48% of companies require it for all employees. Thirty-one percent made it mandatory for all employees starting in 2020 or 2021. It is not mandatory for all employees at 35% of companies. Included in this bucket are companies that have made the decision to make it mandatory for all managers, or all hiring managers, but not for all employees. For instance, an Uber spokesperson told us it has mandatory training on unconscious bias and microaggressions for leaders and has a training program focused on anti-bias for new employee and manager onboarding, but doesn\u2019t require that training for all employees because  research suggests it doesn\u2019t have the \u201cdesired impact.\u201d\n One noteworthy shift that\u2019s just starting to take place is who a company\u2019s DEI head reports to; for the vast majority of the companies who responded to our survey, the DEI head reports to the chief people officer, or equivalent. A small handful\u2014including Facebook, Pinterest, Peloton, and Etsy\u2014have their head of DEI reporting to either the CEO or the head of operations. These changes were made in 2020 or 2021, after the racial justice protests. Only one company\u2014Yelp\u2014had this kind of reporting structure in place before the protests. Its head of DEI has reported to the COO since 2016.\n Giving employees Juneteenth as a paid company holiday is another change that\u2019s occurred in the last year. About half of companies surveyed now close their offices for Juneteenth, starting in 2020. No company had offered Juneteenth as a holiday previously.\n  Overall, we found that about two-thirds of companies had made some kind of DEI policy change after the summer 2020 protests. It should be noted that several companies already had the policies we asked about in place before 2020.\n A year isn\u2019t a long time to create systemic change, and it\u2019s still unclear if any of the changes we\u2019ve catalogued will end tech\u2019s long track record of undervaluing and exploiting Black employees. Based on the interviews featured in the  Black in Tech project, workers just want to be paid and treated fairly; if companies can\u2019t meet those basic requirements, having a Black board member, giving everyone a paid holiday, or donating millions certainly won\u2019t solve the problem.\n We are publishing and analyzing this data to hold these companies accountable for their promises, since without transparency change will be even further out of reach.  Fast Company will continue to follow how these commitments impact tech workers and users in the years to come.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 09:10:58", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name":

the Big Four firm will not be obligated to work from the office for a minimum number of days per week, as has been a typical response of Deloitte\u2019s competitors.\n Some 15,000 Deloitte staff responded to an internal survey about the future of work at the Big Four firm, with more than 80 per cent of those saying they expected to work from a Deloitte office for two days or fewer per week.\n     More than 90 per cent of Deloitte\u2019s workforce said \u2018choice\u2019 and \u2018flexibility\u2019 should be at the heart of how the business operates in future.\n Deloitte senior partner and chief executive Richard Houston said: \u201cThe impact of the pandemic has profoundly changed our way of life, not least in the way we work. The last year has really shown that one size does not fit all when it comes to balancing work and personal lives.\n \u201cIt has also shown that we can trust our people to make the right choice in when, how and where they work.\u201d\n He continued: \u201cOnce the Government has lifted all of the Covid-19 restrictions and we\u2019re back up to full office capacity, we will let our people choose where they need to be to do their best work, in balance with their professional and personal responsibilities.\u201d\n Deloitte said when restrictions are eased its offices will principally be used for team collaboration, training and client meetings.\n     Many City companies have announced plans to adopt a hybrid structure post-pandemic, with staff asked to spend some time in the office each week.\n Competitors KPMG and EY have said staff will spend on average two days in the office each week, while rival PwC estimated staff will be in the office between two and three days.\n The government is currently consulting on plans that could prevent employers from forcing staff to come into the office unless they can prove it is essential.\n A Whitehall source told The Mail: \u201cWe are looking at introducing a default right to flexible working. That would cover things like reasonable requests by parents to start late so they can drop their kids at childcare.\n \u201cBut in the case of office workers in particular it would also cover working from home \u2013 that would be the default right unless the employer could show good reason why someone should not.\u201d\n   The government has shot down the reports, with the Prime Minister understood to be against large-scale working from home beyond final lockdown restrictions.\n     \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags:  Big Four", "posttime": "2021-06-22 09:10:01", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u544a\u8bc9,tells", "title": "\u5fb7\u7f57\u7279\u544a\u8bc9\u5458\u5de5\u4ed6\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u6c38\u8fdc\u5728\u5bb6\u5de5\u4f5c ", "title_en": "Deloitte tells staff they can work from home forever", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cityam.com/deloitte-tells-staff-they-can-work-from-home-forever/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u544a\u8bc9", "tells"]}]
