More than 100,000 Americans are in the hospital right now, sick with COVID-19 —  the most there’s ever been.</p><p>在美国首次出现令人恐惧的冠状病毒病例高峰八个月之后，美国人正面临着另一场危险的大流行病流行。目前，有超过100,000名美国人因COVID-19而住院，这是有史以来最多的。</p><p> At least 13.9 million people in the US have had the virus. Some fully recovered and bounced right back to their lives, perhaps without even knowing they’d ever been infected. Some — at least 273,000 so far — have died.</p><p> 在美国，至少有1390万人感染了该病毒。一些人完全康复并弹回了自己的生活，也许甚至不知道自己曾经被感染过。到目前为止，至少有273,000人死亡。</p><p> And others, like me, have been dragged through an indefinite cycle of headaches, exhaustion, chest pains, and shortness of breath, their post-viral symptoms dragging out for weeks that have turned into months, with no end or relief in sight.</p><p> 和其他人（如我）一样，经历了无数次的头痛，精疲力竭，胸痛和呼吸急促，他们的病毒后症状拖延了数周之久，而这些症状已持续数月之久，看不到尽头或缓解。</p><p> I’m 33 years old. Before I got sick with COVID-19 in April, I was traveling nonstop for my work as a campaign reporter, with 12- to 14-hour days on my feet, sometimes working 10 or more days in a row. In between all that, I’d fit in hot yoga classes and jogs every couple of days.</p><p> 我今年33岁。在四月份患COVID-19之前，我作为竞选记者不停地旅行，每天要花12到14个小时，有时甚至连续工作10天以上。在这一切之间，我每两天就会参加热瑜伽课和慢跑。</p><p> The best way I can describe how I am now, at the end of this strange, horrible year, is that I wake up most days feeling like I drank a six-pack of beer the night before. Washing the dishes, doing my laundry, or walking a few blocks leaves me in need of a sit-down. It’s a sort of gritty feeling in my body, a woolly feeling in my brain. My breathing is up and down; when I&#39;m tired, I forget words midsentence. I need at least 10 hours of sleep most nights. And if I push too hard, it’s not just laborious — it’s actually painful, from my lungs to my head to the stinging in my eyes.</p><p> 最好的方式来形容我在这个陌生而又可怕的一年结束时的状态是，我大部分时间醒来时都感到自己前一天晚上喝了六包啤酒。洗碗，洗衣服或走几步都需要坐下。我的身体里有种坚毅的感觉，脑子里有种似羊毛的感觉。我的呼吸上下波动；当我累的时候，我会忘记句子的句子。大多数夜晚，我至少需要10个小时的睡眠时间。而且，如果我用力过猛，那不仅费劲，而且还很痛苦，从我的肺部到我的头，再到眼睛的刺痛。</p><p> “Hopefully it will improve soon,” one doctor told me a few months ago. That was the extent of her advice.</p><p> “希望很快会好转，”几个月前一位医生告诉我。那就是她的忠告。</p><p> Before he got sick in July, “I had tons of energy. I’d never take a break, probably like you,” Junior Ky, a 27-year-old musician and patient benefit adviser at a hospital in Orlando, told me. “And just all of a sudden, it just hit me out of nowhere. I went from feeling 27 to feeling like I&#39;m 207 years old.”</p><p> 在他七月份生病之前，“我充满了精力。我永远都不会休息，大概和你一样。”现年27岁的音乐家，奥兰多一家医院的患者福利顾问Junior Ky告诉我。 “突然之间，它突然袭击了我。我从27岁变成了207岁。 </p><p> For the past eight months, those of us who have long-term post-COVID symptoms, as well as those who’ve watched loved ones suffer or die from the virus, have seen the president refuse to acknowledge that COVID-19 has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans and made many millions more sick,  calling it a “Fake News Media Conspiracy” — even after getting sick himself.</p><p>在过去的八个月中，我们当中那些长期出现COVID后症状的人，以及那些目睹亲人遭受病毒感染或死亡的人，都看到总统拒绝承认COVID-19已杀死数百人数以千计的美国人，甚至使数百万人患病，甚至称自己生病后也称其为“假新闻媒体阴谋”。</p><p> “Don’t let it dominate you. Don’t be afraid of it,” Trump said right after coming out of Walter Reed Medical Center, where he’d been treated with antibodies and steroids inaccessible to most Americans. “You’re going to beat it. We have the best medical equipment, we have the best medicines, all developed recently.”</p><p> “不要让它统治你。别担心，”特朗普从沃尔特·里德医疗中心出来后说道，他在那里接受了大多数美国人无法获得的抗体和类固醇的治疗。 “您将击败它。我们拥有最好的医疗设备，我们拥有最好的药品，都是最近开发的。”</p><p> Of course, hundreds of thousands of people haven’t simply “beaten” the virus. Now, can the US be a place where someone can survive even if they’re knocked off track by a severe illness? The answer, for a long time, has been that it is not.</p><p> 当然，成千上万的人并没有简单地“打败”该病毒。现在，即使有人被严重疾病击倒，美国也可以成为一个可以生存的地方吗？长期以来，答案一直是，事实并非如此。</p><p> This country’s disability safety net has  been woefully inadequate since well before the pandemic. It’s certainly not capable now of handling the needs of everyone who is currently seeing or will in the next few months see their lives dramatically upended by long-term COVID-related illness.</p><p> 自大流行发生以来，这个国家的残疾安全网严重不足。现在肯定无法满足目前正在或将来几个月内会因长期与COVID相关的疾病而大大恶化的人们的需求。</p><p> We have a president-elect who has  acknowledged the devastation of COVID-19 and has a clear plan to address the pandemic — but there are still two and a half months to survive before that plan can be put into action. And there’s still no specific plan to federally fund clinics or research to help people with lingering symptoms. Biden’s main offering, according to his team, is to protect health insurance coverage for preexisting conditions and make insurance accessible for those who lose their jobs because of the pandemic. That will make a crucial difference for many people who have long-term symptoms and no health insurance — but even those of us with post-viral problems who already have decent health insurance are struggling to access guidance and care.</p><p> 我们有一个当选总统谁承认COVID-19的破坏和有一个明确的计划，以应对流感大流行 - 但还有两个半月的生存之前，该计划可以付诸行动。而且，仍然没有具体的计划来联邦资助诊所或研究来帮助症状持续的人。根据拜登的团队，拜登的主要服务是为已有的疾病提供健康保险，并为因大流行而失业的人们提供保险。对于许多长期症状却没有健康保险的人来说，这将是至关重要的区别，但是，即使是我们那些已经有了体面健康保险的病毒后问题患者，也正在努力获得指导和护理。</p><p>    COVID-19 has forced me to reevaluate how I think about health, work, vulnerability, and strength. And I’ve wondered whether the pandemic will force our culture at large to make some reevaluations, too. Maybe it will force us to question the American cult of individualism, that idea that doing well or being well is solely down to a person’s willpower. Maybe it will finally make clear that we’re not, as the ads at the beginning of the lockdowns said, “all in this together,” and that our failure to think about collective health and responsibility means many, many people fall through the cracks in a crisis.</p><p>    COVID-19迫使我重新评估我对健康，工作，脆弱性和力量的看法。而且我想知道这种流行病是否还会迫使我们的整个文化做出一些重新评估。也许这将迫使我们质疑美国的个人主义，认为做得好还是完全取决于一个人的意志力。也许最终会表明我们并非如此，正如锁定开始时的广告所说的那样：“所有这些都在一起”，而且我们未能考虑集体健康和责任感意味着很多人陷入了困境。在危机中。</p><p> By the time we have a vaccine, there will only be  more of us struggling to see what the future looks like with slowed down bodies and long-term consequences of the virus, trying to figure out how to live a different kind of life for however long this lasts.</p><p> 等到我们有了疫苗时，只会有更多的人为挣扎着看看未来的情况而变慢，身体变慢以及病毒的长期后果，试图找出如何过着不同的生活这持续多久。 </p><p> When well-meaning friends express shock at how long I’ve been sick and how supportive my employer has been in giving me time to recover, it rankles. I’m so grateful, but shouldn’t we all have this basic human consideration? To be able to rest and recover instead of driving ourselves to work, potentially at the cost of our lives? But the paradox is that if we don’t just keep laboring through it, we can’t afford to survive.</p><p>当好心的朋友对我生病多久以及老板给我时间康复提供的支持表示震惊时，它就感到震惊。我非常感激，但我们不应该都拥有这种基本的人类考虑因素吗？能够休息和恢复而不是驱使自己去工作，可能会以牺牲生命为代价？但自相矛盾的是，如果我们不只是继续努力，就无法生存。</p><p>    Every now and then, over the past seven months, I have obsessively gone back through my calendar and counted the days leading up to it. On March 5, I was in LA at a packed rally for Joe Biden, talking to voters about why they’d gotten behind him after their candidates dropped out.</p><p>    在过去的七个月中，我时不时地回过头来查看日历，并计算了到达日历的日子。 3月5日，我在洛杉矶参加乔·拜登的集会中，与选民谈论他们为什么在候选人退学后落后于他。</p><p> On March 6, I was at LAX, and it had started to sink in that things were getting weird. There were a few people in masks. I looked for hand sanitizer everywhere — and bought four bottles at the only place that still had them, the Magic Johnson store in Terminal 5. On the flight, I sat wedged between two men, chatting with one about news of this virus and prognosticating how bad it could really get. “If you look at what we know, millions of Americans are going to get sick,” he said. “And I guess a lot of people are going to die.” We looked at each other in silence for a moment. The other man next to me sneezed and wiped his nose with his hand.</p><p> 3月6日，我在LAX，事情开始变得怪异，它开始下沉。有几个人戴着面具。我到处寻找洗手液-并在仅有的5个航站楼的Magic Johnson商店里买了四瓶洗手液。在飞行中，我坐在两个人之间，与一个人聊起有关这种病毒的消息，并预测了如何不好，它真的可以得到。他说：“如果你看看我们所知道的，数百万的美国人将会生病。” “而且我想很多人会死。”我们沉默了一下。我旁边的另一个男人打喷嚏，用手擦了擦鼻子。</p><p> On March 7, I was in Kansas City, Missouri, reporting on another Biden rally. Before it started, I sat in a crowded restaurant with colleagues eating barbeque with our hands.</p><p> 3月7日，我在密苏里州堪萨斯城，报道了另一次拜登集会。在开始之前，我和同事们一起坐在一家拥挤的餐厅里，用手吃着烧烤。</p><p> Pretty soon after, the campaign trail dissolved, and we all retreated to our respective bubbles. The first weekend I was home in DC, my 12-year-old cousin came over for a sleepover — we watched movies and snuggled on the couch, cooked and ate dinner together, no masks, no 6-foot distance between us. It&#39;s a very specific ache now, to think about the warmth of being that close to someone you love.</p><p> 此后不久，竞选活动便消失了，我们都退到了各自的泡沫中。我在华盛顿特区的第一个周末，我12岁的堂兄过来过夜了-我们看电影，依ugg在沙发上，一起煮饭和吃晚餐，没有口罩，我们之间没有6英尺的距离。现在想想与自己所爱的人亲近的温暖是非常特殊的。</p><p> On April 4, a Saturday, I went for a run, and that’s when things took a turn. I couldn’t stop coughing — I assumed it was allergies. But for days afterward, the coughing didn’t stop.</p><p> 4月4日（星期六），我参加了一次跑步比赛，当时一切都发生了变化。我无法停止咳嗽-我以为是过敏。但是几天后，咳嗽并没有停止。</p><p> By April 8, a Wednesday night, I wrote this email to my editors at 2:51 a.m., during a four-hour-long coughing fit.</p><p> 到了4月8日（星期三晚上），我在四个小时的咳嗽期间于凌晨2:51写了这封电子邮件给编辑。 </p><p> Hey just wanted to let you both know, coughing is a fair bit worse tonight. Reached back out to One Medical and will assess what to do in the morning I think.</p><p>嘿，只是想让你们俩都知道，今晚咳嗽要严重得多。重新回到One Medical，我会评估早上该怎么做。</p><p> Hoping it settles but just wanted to make sure you had that and to keep you posted.</p><p> 希望它能解决，但只是想确保您拥有该信息并保持发布状态。</p><p> I gave them my updated emergency contact number, my aunt’s, just in case.</p><p> 为了防万一，我给了他们最新的紧急联系电话，姑姑。</p><p> Looking back, the mild language I was using speaks to how reluctant I was to accept that something serious was happening to me. When I said I was doing “fair bit worse,” I was actually struggling to breathe. When I said I would assess what to do in the morning, I was really considering whether I needed to call an ambulance and go to the hospital right then.</p><p> 回顾过去，我所使用的温和语言表达了我多么不情愿地接受严重的事情正在发生。当我说我做的“还差一点”时，我实际上是在努力呼吸。当我说我要评估早晨该怎么做时，我真的在考虑是否需要当时叫一辆救护车去医院。</p><p> I didn’t go to the hospital in the end, though maybe I should have. Sitting up in bed, I watched videos my mum sent me from a doctor on YouTube explaining how to breathe through COVID coughing and got through the night.</p><p> 最后我没有去医院，尽管也许我应该去。坐在床上，我看了妈妈从YouTube上的一位医生给我发送的视频，解释了如何通过COVID咳嗽进行呼吸并通宵达旦。</p><p>    What came next was several months of intense sickness, followed by several more months of getting a bit better and then worse again. It felt like I was being put through my paces with cycles of new and freshly horrifying symptoms every few weeks. For about a month, I was throwing up a lot and had to switch to a bland diet. Then for about two months, I woke up every day with intense chest pain, as if I&#39;d been doing chest presses all night in my sleep. The headaches, fevers, and shortness of breath came and went throughout. Month to month I can see that I’m very slowly getting some energy back — but there’s the constant possibility, which no one has been able to really rule out, that one of these setbacks will be so bad that I actually do end up in the hospital, or worse.</p><p>    接下来发生的是几个月的重病，接着又是几个月的好转，然后又变得更糟。感觉每隔几周，我就会被新的和令人恐怖的症状所困扰。大约一个月，我呕吐很多，不得不改用平淡的饮食。然后，大约两个月，我每天都醒来时剧烈的胸痛，好像我整夜都在做胸部按压一样。头痛，发烧和呼吸急促无处不在。一个月又一个月，我可以看到我正在慢慢地恢复精力-但是有一种持续的可能性，没有人能够真正排除这种挫折，其中一种挫败会非常糟糕，以至于我最终会陷入困境医院，或更糟糕的是。</p><p> One day early on, I tried to do a YouTube yoga session “for when you’re sick” and ended up a sobbing mess on the mat instead because I didn’t have the energy to get past about three minutes.</p><p> 提早一天，我试图做一个YouTube瑜伽课程，“当你生病时”，结果在垫子上抽泣着，因为我没有精力去超过三分钟。 </p><p> I kept pushing myself to get back to work, as though by the force of sheer willpower I could stop being sick. The day Trump left Walter Reed Medical Center, I watched on TV as he puffed up the steps of the White House to the Truman Balcony, where he removed his mask, waved, and saluted.</p><p>我一直在努力使自己恢复工作，好像凭着坚定的意志力我可以不再生病了。特朗普离开沃尔特·里德医疗中心的那一天，我在电视上看了他将白宫的台阶吹向杜鲁门阳台的地方，在那里他摘下了面具，挥手致意。</p><p> An obvious lesson I learned this year: You can&#39;t bully yourself into disappearing a life-threatening illness. The idea that the president seemed stuck on, that it’s a question of fearlessness or mental toughness, is just not how this — or any — illness really works.</p><p> 我今年学到的一个明显的教训是：您不能欺负自己，以致于消失了威胁生命的疾病。总统似乎坚持的想法，这是一个无所畏惧或精神强壮的问题，并不是这种疾病或任何疾病如何真正起作用。</p><p> And yet, as he minimized the disease on national television, I once again minimized my own sickness:  I can get back to work in a day or two, I told myself, while I labored to breathe.  Just one more day.</p><p> 然而，当他在国家电视台上将疾病最小化时，我再次将自己的疾病最小化：我告诉自己，在我努力呼吸的同时，我可以在一两天内重返工作岗位。再过一天。</p><p>    So far, there’s an element of randomness in how hard different people are hit by COVID — we don’t yet have the research to tell us why a healthy 33-year-old is knocked down for months while a seventysomething man with other risk factors can bounce back in days (though level of care can certainly be a factor; not everyone has had access to the president’s exclusive, top-tier treatment). Our recovery, too, is not created equal. In a country with no federally mandated paid sick leave or protections for workers who are too ill to work — even in a pandemic, when spreading the disease is a serious public health risk — people with long COVID are forced to choose between resting for their health and a paycheck.</p><p>    到目前为止，COVID对不同人的打击程度有一定的随机性-我们尚无一项研究告诉我们，为什么一个健康的33岁老人被撞倒几个月，而一个有其他危险因素的七十多岁男人却被撞倒了可以在几天之内反弹（尽管一定程度的照顾当然是一个因素；并不是每个人都可以获得总统的独家顶级待遇）。我们的复苏也不是平等的。在一个没有联邦政府规定的带薪病假或无法保护工作不佳的工人的国家中，即使是在大流行中，当传播疾病是严重的公共健康风险时，长COVID的人被迫在休息以恢复健康和工资。</p><p> That leads to a deep-seated fear that so many of us, and particularly women of color, have ingrained in us. If you stop working, if you don’t push yourself, if you don’t fight for it, you lose everything.</p><p> 这导致了一种根深蒂固的恐惧，那就是我们中的许多人，尤其是有色女人，已经根深蒂固。如果您停止工作，不勉强自己，不为之奋斗，则将失去一切。</p><p> Some of the questions I asked myself in the first few months I was ill:</p><p> 在我生病的最初几个月里，我问自己一些问题：</p><p> Are you really this sick? Why aren’t you tough enough to get back up and keep going? Why aren’t you doing your job as a reporter as the world falls to bits around you? What use are you like this to the people you love and the world at large?</p><p> 你真的病了吗您为什么不足够坚强地站起来并继续前进？当周围的世界变得微不足道时，您为什么不做记者呢？您对您所爱的人和整个世界有何用处？ </p><p> Whether or not they can work is also not an abstract question for the four others with long COVID who I spoke to for this story. Jenn Fryer, 36, from Costa Mesa, California, lost her job as a fashion designer in March, a few months before she got sick. She’s been avoiding seeing doctors, especially because her brother, who also had COVID-19, was hospitalized for a few weeks and landed with a roughly million-dollar bill. He has insurance that will help with those charges, she said, but for her, it’s not an option to rack up medical costs.</p><p>对于本故事我与之交谈的其他四个COVID较长的人，他们是否可以工作也不是一个抽象的问题。 36岁的珍妮·弗莱尔（Jenn Fryer）来自加利福尼亚的科斯塔梅萨（Costa Mesa），在生病几个月前，她于3月失去了时装设计师的工作。她一直在避免去看医生，尤其是因为她的弟弟，她也患有COVID-19，已经住院了几周，并支付了大约一百万美元的费用。她说，他有可以帮助支付这些费用的保险，但是对她来说，这不是增加医疗费用的选择。</p><p> “Ever since my brother went to the hospital and got put on the ventilator, I get massive anxiety attacks thinking about it. I&#39;ll just break down crying. I don&#39;t even want to go for a checkup or anything. And I was also scared … because I don&#39;t have health insurance right now,” she said. Jenn said she’s receiving $450 per week, the maximum unemployment she can get in California, which only just covers her rent.</p><p> “自从我哥哥去医院戴上呼吸机以来，我就开始对此感到焦虑不安。我只是打破哭声。我什至不想去做检查或其他任何事情。而且我也很害怕……因为我现在没有健康保险，”她说。詹恩（Jenn）说，她每周可获得450美元，这是她在加利福尼亚州可获得的最高失业率，仅能支付她的租金。</p><p> “I mean, it affects your self-esteem, but also it’s our livelihood. And especially right now, it&#39;s not getting any extra help from the government anymore. You can&#39;t really survive that way,” she said, referring to the end of the unemployment funding boost from the federal CARES Act.</p><p> “我的意思是，这会影响您的自尊心，但这也是我们的生计。特别是现在，它不再从政府那里得到任何额外的帮助。您不能真的那样生存下去，”她说，指的是联邦《 CARES法案》中失业资金的增加。</p><p> She’s trying to apply for jobs, but there’s not a lot out there — and just the effort of going through the interview is sometimes absolutely exhausting.</p><p> 她正在尝试求职，但那里面不多-有时，通过面试的努力绝对是精疲力尽。</p><p> “I had an interview last month, and I had to put together a whole presentation and do that via Zoom, and it was exhausting. Like afterwards, I felt like I ran like 5 miles. And it&#39;s not just like exhausting physically; it’s exhausting mentally,” she said. “I realized that even the way that I pronounce things is different, which is kind of weird. I&#39;ll have to think about it, like is this pronounced this way or this way?”</p><p> “上个月我接受了一次采访，我不得不整理整个演示文稿，然后通过Zoom进行操作，这很累人。像之后一样，我感觉自己跑了5英里。而且这不只是身体上的疲惫；她精神上很累。”她说。 “我意识到，即使我说话的方式也不同，这很奇怪。我必须考虑一下，就像这样或这样发音吗？”</p><p> Carlos Cabral, 35, who works as a surgical technologist at a hospital in Pasadena, California, got sick from COVID-19 after traveling to Mexico to be with his dying grandfather in April. He was hospitalized for about a week, and in that time he was so sick that his lungs, kidneys, and heart were affected. A few days in, the doctor suggested he talk to a chaplain and sort out his financial affairs because it wasn’t looking good.</p><p> 现年35岁的卡洛斯·卡布拉尔（Carlos Cabral）在加利福尼亚州帕萨迪纳的一家医院担任外科技术员，今年4月前往墨西哥与垂死的祖父同住后，因COVID-19病倒了。他住院了大约一个星期，那时他病得很厉害，以至于他的肺，肾和心脏都受到了影响。几天后，医生建议他与牧师交谈，并理清自己的财务状况，因为情况看起来不太好。</p><p> “I wrote a farewell message on my phone to my mom, my dad, and my sisters and my best friend. That was a really powerful moment for me this year. Where I felt like I had no control over what was happening. I lived a beautiful life. I felt grateful, but you know, at the end of the day, all I really wanted was to hug them one last time.”</p><p> “我在手机上给妈妈，爸爸，姐妹和最好的朋友写了告别消息。对我来说，那是非常重要的时刻。我觉得自己无法控制正在发生的事情。我过着美好的生活。我感到很感激，但最终，我真正想要的就是最后一次拥抱他们。” </p><p> The following day, somehow, Carlos began to recover. He’s back at work now, but his lungs are not back to normal, he said he’s noticeably slower than he used to be, and he still has fatigue and neuropathy — tingling and pain — in his hands and feet. He told his bosses he can’t pull the 24-hour shifts that are expected at the hospital anymore, so they’re cutting his shifts back to 12 hours at a time.</p><p>第二天，卡洛斯以某种方式开始恢复。他现在恢复工作，但肺部仍未恢复正常，他说自己的速度明显慢于以往，并且手脚仍然有疲劳和神经病（刺痛和疼痛）。他告诉老板，他再也无法实现医院期望的24小时轮班制，因此他们将他的轮班制降低到了12小时一次。</p><p>    Junior had to put his music work on hold — when he got sick in July he was about to record an EP. His work at the hospital, too, has paused. He’s on short-term disability right now, because he can’t do his job remotely and he’s not only too fatigued to work but also scared of whether or not he’s still infectious. He’s been testing negative for COVID, but he’s worried about his lingering symptoms. His hospital, like many others around the country, has also been losing money fast. They’ve closed their outpatient services and have a freeze on hiring, so he can’t look for a job in a different department there. Junior is very concerned that he’ll soon lose his job.</p><p>    Junior不得不暂停音乐工作-7月份生病时，他将要录制一张EP。他在医院的工作也暂停了。他现在处于短期残疾状态，因为他无法远程完成工作，而且不仅累得无法工作，而且还担心自己是否仍然具有传染性。他一直在测试COVID阴性，但他担心自己的挥之不去的症状。像全国许多其他医院一样，他的医院也一直在快速亏损。他们已经关闭了门诊服务并冻结了招聘，因此他无法在当地的其他部门找工作。 Junior非常担心自己很快会失业。</p><p> “I had to take like a month off, and then I told them after the month, I still don&#39;t feel good. I could probably drive to work. That&#39;s pretty much the extent of my energy is driving to work, and once I get there, it&#39;s done,” he said.</p><p> “我不得不休假一个月，然后一个月后我告诉他们，我仍然感觉不好。我可能会开车去上班。这几乎是我精力的驱动力，而一旦到达那里，就完成了。”他说。</p><p> At first, like me, he struggled with not being able to work and be more helpful in the midst of a pandemic.</p><p> 起初，像我一样，他在工作中挣扎着无法工作，在大流行中变得更加乐于助人。</p><p> But then “it kind of shifted my perspective,” Junior said. “Before it was, ‘I miss going to work,’ but as the symptoms progressed and life kept going on but you kind of stay in that same place, now I see things [differently]. Now it&#39;s not ‘I miss going to work.’ It&#39;s ‘I miss being able to walk down the sidewalk for 30 minutes.’”</p><p> 但是随后，“这改变了我的看法，” Junior说。 “在此之前，‘我很想去上班’，但是随着症状的发展和生活的不断发展，但您仍然待在同一个地方，现在我[不同地]看到了一切。现在不是“我想念上班。”而是“我想念在人行道上走了30分钟。”</p><p>    Not knowing when I’ll see and hug my mum (and other people I love) again.</p><p>    不知道何时能见到我的妈妈（和我爱的其他人）。</p><p>    There are a handful of clinics around the country  starting to focus specifically on COVID patients with post-viral symptoms. But there isn’t widely available medical support or research to help this new population of Americans. As someone with pretty good health insurance, it’s still taken me more than six months to speak to a doctor, my cardiologist, who actually tried to get to the root of what I’m going through. Last week, after several tests, he landed on the same thing several other doctors have told me: It’s not clear why I’m not better yet, and there’s nothing to be done except rest and wait.</p><p>    全国各地有少数诊所开始专门针对具有病毒后症状的COVID患者。但是，没有广泛的医疗支持或研究可以帮助这一新的美国人群体。作为拥有相当不错的健康保险的人，与我的心脏病专家的医生交谈仍然花了我六个多月的时间，而他实际上试图了解我所经历的事情。上周，在经过几次测试后，他发现了其他几位医生告诉我的事情：不清楚为什么我还没有好起来，除了休息和等待，别无选择。 </p><p> In other countries, governments are starting to acknowledge that the long-term public health fallout of long COVID isn’t going away. The head of the UK’s National Health Service  said last week that it will open 40 publicly funded clinics to serve people with these post-viral complications, investing £10 million into clinical services, planning, and research.</p><p>在其他国家/地区，政府开始承认长COVID的长期公共卫生影响不会消失。英国国家卫生局局长上周表示，它将开设40家由政府资助的诊所，为患有这些病毒后并发症的人们提供服务，并在临床服务，规划和研究方面投资1000万英镑。</p><p> “Long COVID is already having a very serious impact on many people’s lives and could well go on to affect hundreds of thousands,” said NHS Chief Executive Simon Stevens, estimating that around 60,000 people in the UK are already dealing with long-term COVID symptoms.  “More recent evidence is also showing that long COVID can be categorised into four different syndromes: post intensive care syndrome, post viral fatigue syndrome, permanent organ damage and long term COVID syndrome,” the NHS announcement said.</p><p> NHS首席执行官西蒙·史蒂文斯（Simon Stevens）表示：“长时间的COVID已经对许多人的生活造成了非常严重的影响，很可能继续影响数十万人。”他估计，英国已经有大约60,000人正在应对长期的COVID症状。 NHS声明说：“最新证据还表明，长期的COVID可以分为四种综合症：重症监护综合症，病毒性疲劳综合症，永久性器官损伤和长期COVID综合症。”</p><p> That’s already more clarity than most of us in the US with long COVID have been able to get. Our CDC took until July to even acknowledge that people have long-term issues from COVID and now  offers only this explanation: “The long-term significance of these effects is not yet known. CDC will continue active investigation and provide updates as new data emerge, which can inform COVID-19 clinical care as well as the public health response to COVID-19.”</p><p> 这已经比美国大多数拥有长COVID的人能够获得的更加清晰。我们的疾病预防控制中心直到7月份才承认人们存在COVID的长期问题，现在仅提供以下解释：“这些影响的长期意义尚不清楚。疾病预防控制中心将继续积极调查，并在出现新数据时提供更新，这些数据可以为COVID-19临床护理以及对COVID-19的公共卫生响应提供信息。”</p><p> In the absence of real medical guidance, we’re realizing that we need to learn how to live with this illness. Educating ourselves in these support groups is exhausting but necessary — something we’re learning from people who have for far longer dealt with other “invisible” illnesses like chronic fatigue and lupus. They’re all too familiar with what we’re dealing with now: when the medical profession doesn’t seem to have many answers for you, and the people around you find it hard to understand or even believe that you’re struggling.</p><p> 在没有真正医学指导的情况下，我们意识到我们需要学习如何忍受这种疾病。在这些支持小组中进行自我教育是很累但必不可少的-我们正在向那些已经长期治疗其他“无形”疾病（例如慢性疲劳和狼疮）的人学习。他们对我们现在正在处理的事情都太熟悉了：当医学界似乎对您没有太多答案时，您周围的人会很难理解甚至认为您正在挣扎。</p><p> For many people — myself included — the scarcity of tests early in the pandemic has left us adrift in a  particularly strange limbo, experiencing the crushing symptoms of the virus while having no definitive positive test result.</p><p> 对于许多人（包括我本人在内），大流行初期缺乏测试，使我们陷入了一种特别奇怪的困境，经历了病毒的致命症状，而没有明确的阳性测试结果。</p><p> When tests were still scarce, many people were told by doctors that they likely had the virus but couldn’t get tested unless they were hospitalized. And then there were plenty of false negative test results, which doctors said they were getting a lot of in the early months. (That’s what happened to me — and after ruling out other possibilities, I was told by doctors that I should assume I had COVID-19.)</p><p> 当测试仍然很匮乏时，医生告诉许多人他们很可能感染了这种病毒，但除非住院，否则无法进行测试。然后有很多假阴性测试结果，医生说他们在最初的几个月中得到了很多。 （这就是我的经历-在排除其他可能性之后，医生告诉我，我应该假设我患有COVID-19。）</p><p> Both of those scenarios are particularly hard to deal with in this culture of reluctance to give people space and resources to be sick and recover, where illness must be in some way certified to be taken seriously (to the point where, in several states, voters had to  provide a doctor’s note to be able to vote by mail in the midst of a pandemic).</p><p> 在这种不愿给人们留下空间和资源来使病人得病和康复的文化中，这两种情况都特别难以处理，在这种文化中，必须以某种方式证明疾病得到了认真对待（以致在某些州，选民必须提供医生记录，以便在大流行期间可以通过邮件投票）。 </p><p> “I woke up with fatigue so bad one day — I woke up and I actually laughed because of how ridiculous the fatigue was, like, if I were to tell people nobody would believe me. I was that tired,” said Junior. “No one will ever believe me that I can barely walk to the bathroom.”</p><p>“有一天，我非常疲倦地醒来，我醒了，我实际上笑了，因为疲劳是如此荒谬，例如，如果我告诉别人没有人会相信我。我好累，” Junior说。 “没有人会相信我，我几乎不能步行去洗手间。”</p><p> Carlos said he filed a complaint to the hospital he works for after a surgeon and anaesthesiologist he was working with went on a tirade claiming COVID-19 wasn’t real and mocking him after he told them he was having a hard day with the fatigue. They were suspended for their comments, he said.</p><p> 卡洛斯（Carlos）说，在与他一起工作的一名外科医生和麻醉师进行一次长篇游行之后，他向他所在的医院提起诉讼，声称他对COVID-19并不真实，并嘲笑了他，因为他告诉他们自己因疲劳而辛苦了一天。他说，他们被暂停发表评论。</p><p> “After that moment, I remember thinking,  I&#39;ve always been such a happy person. I&#39;m just so tired of feeling unworthy. Because that’s what it’s like, feeling broken. Like not myself,” he said. He’s taken up meditation, which has helped improve his mental health, and tries to keep up a routine of gentle stretching every day.</p><p> “在那一刻之后，我记得当时在想，我一直是一个如此快乐的人。我对自己的不配感到非常厌倦。因为那就是它的样子，感觉很破碎。他说：“不喜欢我自己。”他接受了冥想，这有助于改善他的心理健康，并试图保持每天例行的轻柔伸展运动。</p><p> In one long COVID support group, there’s a discussion about histamines, with links to preliminary studies. In another, people share stori</p><p> 在一个长期的COVID支持小组中，有一个关于组胺的讨论，其中包含与初步研究的链接。另一方面，人们分享故事</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/过去/">#过去</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/years/">#years</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/covid/">#covid</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
