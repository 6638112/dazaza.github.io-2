Private Relay is currently available as an opt-in beta in iOS 15. Apple says that this feature means that no one in the chain \u2014 including Apple \u2014 knows who you are or what website you are browsing to.\n It seems carriers in Europe don\u2019t like that idea too much.  Via The Telegraph, operators including Vodafone, Telefonica and T-Mobile signed an open letter voicing their opposition to the rollout of the feature. In fact, some carriers are already blocking support as shown in screenshots from readers below.\n  The letter said that Private Relay cuts off networks and servers from accessing \u201cvital network data and metadata\u201d and will have \u201csignificant consequences in terms of undermining European digital sovereignty\u201d. They say it will also impact \u201coperator\u2019s ability to efficiently manage telecommunication networks\u201d.\n It\u2019s unclear why the companies are speaking out against Private Relay, when general VPN services have been widely available for years and do much of the same role. Perhaps it is the fact that Private Relay is so easily accessible that they expect a lot of people to use it; the feature is built into iOS 15 and available to any customer with a paid iCloud plan.\n As of the latest shipping release, iOS 15.2, Private Relay is off by default but Apple has signalled that it will be enabled as standard once Private Relay leaves beta testing phase.\n Cynically, Private Relay and other VPN services block the carriers ability to upsell internet features based on your phone plan, like compressing images or restricting HD video streaming to more expensive tiers.\n The Telegraph says mobile carriers in the UK have also aired concerns, including complaints to regulators from O2.\n Availability of Private Relay is already restricted by geography. In compliance with local laws, Apple has already announced that Private Relay will not be offered in China, Belarus, Colombia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkmenistan, Uganda and the Philippines.\n Enterprise-managed devices can also choose to disable Private Relay for their employees using MDM profiles.\n Some cellular data plans also appear to already be explicitly denying Private Relay functionality. Readers have sent in screenshots that show the Private Relay screen in Settings reporting that Private Relay is not available on their phone plan.\n  You\u2019re reading 9to5Mac \u2014 experts who break news about Apple and its surrounding ecosystem, day after day.

Flink ML is a library that provides APIs and infrastructure for buildingstream-batch unified machine learning algorithms, that can be easy-to-use andperformant with (near-) real-time latency.\n This release involves a major refactor of the earlier Flink ML library andintroduces major features that extend the Flink ML API and the iterationruntime, such as supporting stages with multi-input multi-output, graph-basedstage composition, and a new stream-batch unified iteration library. Moreover,we added five algorithm implementations in this release, which is the start ofa long-term initiative to provide a large number of off-the-shelf algorithms inFlink ML with state-of-the-art performance.\n We believe this release is an important step towards extending Apache Flink toa wide range of machine learning use cases, especially the real-time machinelearning scenarios.\n We encourage you to  download the release and share your feedback withthe community through the Flink  mailing lists or JIRA! We hope you like the newrelease and we\u2019d be eager to learn about your experience with it.\n     Stages in a machine learning workflow might take multiple inputs and returnmultiple outputs. For example, a graph embedding algorithm might need to readtwo tables, which represent the edge and node of the graph respectively. And aworkflow might need a stage that splits the input dataset into two outputdatasets, for training and testing respectively.\n With this capability, algorithm developers can assemble a machine learningworkflow as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of pre-defined stages. And thisworkflow can be configured and deployed without users knowing theimplementation details of this graph. This improvement could considerablyexpand the applicability and usability of Flink ML.\n  In a native online learning scenario, we have a long-running job that keepsprocessing training data and updating a machine learning model. And we couldhave multiple jobs deployed in web servers which do online inference. It isnecessary to transmit the latest model data from the training job to thoseinference jobs in (near-) real-time latency.\n The traditional Estimator/Transformer paradigm does not provide APIs to exposethis model data in a streaming manner. Users have to repeatedly call fit() toupdate model data. Although users might be able to update model data once everyfew minutes, it is likely very inefficient, if not impossible, to update modeldata once every few seconds with this approach.\n With FLIP-173,model data can be exposed as an unbounded stream via the getModelData() API.Then algorithm users can transfer the model data to web servers in real-timeand use the up-to-date model data to do online inference. This feature couldsignificantly strengthen Flink ML\u2019s capability to support online learningapplications.\n  We care a lot about usability and developer velocity in Flink ML. In thisrelease, we refactored and significantly simplified the experience of defining,getting and setting parameters for algorithms.\n With FLIP-174,parameters can be defined as static variables of an interface, and anyalgorithm that implements the interface could inherit these variabledefinitions without additional work. Commonly used parameter validators areprovided as part of the infrastructure.\n  One of the most useful tool in the existing ML libraries (e.g. Scikit-learn,Flink, Spark) is Pipeline,which allows users to compose an estimator from an ordered list of estimatorsand transformers, without having to explicitly implement the fit/transform forthe estimator/transformer.\n FLIP-175extended this capability from pipeline to DAG. Users can now compose anestimator from a DAG of estimator and transformers. This capability ofcomposition allows developers to slice a complex workflow into simpler modulesand re-use the modules across multiple workflows. We believe this capabilitycould significantly improve the experience of building and deploying complexworkflows using Flink ML.\n  To support training machine learning algorithms and adjust the model parametersdynamically based on the prediction result, it is necessary to have nativesupport for processing data iteratively. It is known that Flink uses DAG todescribe the process logic, thus we need to provide the iteration library ontop of Flink separately. Besides, since we need to support both offlinetraining and online training / adjustment, the iteration library should supportboth streaming and batch cases.\n FLIP-176 implements astream-batch unified iteration library. It provides the function oftransmitting records back to the precedent operators and the ability to trackthe progress of rounds inside the iteration. Users could directly useDataStream API and Table API to express the execution logic inside theiteration. Besides, the new iteration library also extends Flink\u2019scheckpointing mechanism to also support exactly-once failover for jobs usingiterations.\n  Nowadays many machine learning practitioners are used to developing machinelearning workflows in Python due to its ease-of-use and excellent ecosystem. Tomeet the needs of these users, a Python package dedicated for Flink ML iscreated starting from this release. The Python package currently provides APIssimilar to their Java counterparts for developing machine learning algorithms.\n   In the future we will enhance the Python SDK to enable its interoperabilitywith Flink ML\u2019s Java library, for example, allowing users to express machinelearning workflows in Python, where workflows consist of a mixture of stagesfrom the Flink ML Java library as well as stages implemented in Python (e.g. aTensorFlow program).\n  Now that the Flink ML API re-design is done, we started the initiative to addoff-the-shelf algorithms in Flink ML. As part of this initiative, we borrowedideas from the  Alink project, and workedclosely with developers of the Alink project to design the new Flink ML APIs,refactor, optimize and migrate algorithms from Alink to Flink. Our long-termgoal is to provide a library of performant algorithms that are easy to use,debug and customize for your needs.\n We have implemented five algorithms in this release, i.e. logistic regression,k-means, k-nearest neighbors, naive bayes and one-hot encoder. For now thesealgorithms focus on validating the APIs and iteration runtime. In addition toadding more and more algorithms, we will also stress test and optimize theirperformance to make sure these algorithms have state-of-the-art performance.Stay tuned!\n   To accelerate the development of Flink ML, the effort has moved to the newrepository  flink-ml under the Flinkproject. We here follow a similar approach like the Stateful Functions effort,where a separate repository has helped to speed up the development by allowingfor more light-weight contribution workflows and separate release cycles.\n  To facilitate the community collaboration on ecosystem projects that extend thecapability of the Apache Flink, Apache Flink PMC has granted the permission touse flink-extended as the name of this  GitHuborganization, which provides a neutralplace to host the code of ecosystem projects.\n Two Flink ML related projects have been moved to this organization. dl-on-flink provides thecapability to implement Flink ML stages using TensorFlow. And clink is a library that facilitatesthe implementation of Flink ML stages using C++ in order to support e.g.real-time feature engineering.\n We hope you can join this effort and share your Flink ecosystem projects inthis Github organization. And stay tuned for more updates on ecosystemprojects.\n  Please review this note for a list of adjustments to make and issues to checkif you plan to upgrade to Flink ML 2.0.0.\n This note discusses any critical information about incompatibilities andbreaking changes, performance changes, and any other changes that might impactyour production deployment of Flink ML.\n FLIP-173made major changes to PipelineStage and its subclasses.

The rusting of iron is an example. Reddish iron oxide forms quickly on iron surfaces exposed to atmospheric oxygen, or O2.\n \u201cWhen you expose fresh crystalline surfaces from the sedimentary reservoir to O2, you get weathering that consumes oxygen,\u201d said Yan, a postdoctoral research associate in Rice\u2019s Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences.\n Another way glaciers could promote the consumption of atmospheric oxygen is by exposing organic carbon that had been buried for millions of years, Yan said.\n  During Yan\u2019s Ph.D. studies in the labs of  Princeton University\u2019s Michael Bender and John Higgins, Yan worked on a 2016 study led by Daniel Stolper, now an assistant professor at the  University of California, Berkeley, that used  air bubbles in ice cores to show the proportion of oxygen in Earth\u2019s atmosphere had declined by about 0.2% in the past 800,000 years.\n In the Science Advances study, Yan, Higgins and colleagues from Oregon State University, the University of Maine and the University of California, San Diego, analyzed bubbles in older ice cores to show the O2 dip began after the length of Earth\u2019s glacial cycles more than doubled around 1 million years ago.\n The ice age Earth is in today  began about 2.7 million years ago. Dozens of glacial cycles followed. In each, ice caps alternately grew, covering up to a third of the planet, and then retreated toward the poles. Each cycle lasted around 40,000 years until about 1 million years ago. At roughly the same time atmospheric oxygen began to decline, glacial cycles began lasting about 100,000 years.\n \u201cThe reason for the decline is the rate of O2 being produced is lower than the rate of O2 being consumed,\u201d Yan said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we call the source and the sink. The source is what produces O2, and the sink is what consumes or drags on O2. In the study, we interpret the decline to be a stronger drag on O2, meaning more is being consumed.\u201d\n  Yan said Earth\u2019s biosphere didn\u2019t contribute to the decline because it is balanced, drawing as much O2 from the atmosphere as it produces. Weathering, on a global scale, is the most likely geological process capable of consuming enough excess O2 to account for the decline, and Yan and colleagues considered two scenarios for increased weathering.\n Global sea level falls when glaciers are advancing and rises when they retreat. When the length of glacial cycles more than doubled, so did the magnitude of swings in sea level. As coastlines advanced, land previously covered by water would have been exposed to the oxidizing power of atmospheric O2.\n \u201cWe did some calculations to see how much oxygen that might consume and found it could only account for about a quarter of the observed decrease,\u201d Yan said.\n Because the extent of ice coverage isn\u2019t precisely known for each glacial cycle, there\u2019s a wider range of uncertainty about the magnitude of chemical weathering from glacial erosion. But Yan said the evidence suggests it could draw enough oxygen to account for the decline.\n \u201cOn a global scale, it\u2019s very hard to pinpoint,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we did some tests about how much additional weathering would be needed to account for the O2 decline, and it\u2019s not unreasonable. Theoretically, it could account for the magnitude of what\u2019s been observed.\u201d\n Reference: \u201cIce core evidence for atmospheric oxygen decline since the Mid-Pleistocene transition\u201d by Yuzhen Yan, Edward J.
