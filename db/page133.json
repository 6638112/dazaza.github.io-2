Hubbard said in a  statement on Monday. &#34;When I broke my arm at the Commonwealth Games three years ago, I was advised that my sporting career had likely reached its end. But your support, your encouragement, and your aroha [love] carried me through the darkness.&#34;\n  But her selection is not without controversy. Some argue that because Hubbard went through male puberty, she will have an unfair advantage over her competitors.\n    Hubbard has met the International Olympic Committee&#39;s  requirements for athletes who transition from male to female. The requirements stipulate that the athlete must declare that her gender identity is female and can&#39;t change that status for sports purposes for at least four years. The athlete&#39;s testosterone level must stay below 10 nanomoles per liter.\n    Those who transition from female to male are eligible to compete in the male category without restriction.\n     Hubbard transitioned to female eight years ago at age 35. Before her transition, Hubbard competed in men&#39;s events, setting national records in junior competition, according to The Associated Press.\n  Hubbard&#39;s inclusion will be a vital signal for trans youth, says  Schuyler Bailar, a trans man who competed in Division I men&#39;s swimming for four years at Harvard University.\n  &#34;The power of inclusion, especially the power of visible inclusion, can be lifesaving,&#34; Bailar says. &#34;I know for me, not seeing other transgender athletes out there, especially other folks in swimming and just specifically trans people everywhere, I didn&#39;t think that I could exist, and I didn&#39;t think I could be myself in my sport. And when I felt like I couldn&#39;t be myself in my sport, I felt like I couldn&#39;t be myself anywhere.&#34;\n    A recent  study published in the  British Journal of Sports Medicine  found that even after a year of hormone therapy, trans women on average had an advantage over cisgender, or nontransgender, women.\n    Anna Vanbellinghen, a Belgian weightlifter who is likely to compete against Hubbard, said in May that Hubbard&#39;s presence in the competition would not be fair.\n  &#34;First off, I would like to stress that I fully support the transgender community and that what I&#39;m about to say doesn&#39;t come from a place of rejection of this athlete&#39;s identity,&#34; Vanbellinghen  told Olympics news site Inside the Games.\n  &#34;I am aware that defining a legal frame for transgender participation in sports is very difficult since there is an infinite variety of situations and that reaching an entirely satisfactory solution, from either side of the debate, is probably impossible.\n    &#34;However, anyone that has trained weightlifting at a high level knows this to be true in their bones: This particular situation is unfair to the sport and to the athletes.&#34;\n     New Zealand Olympic Committee CEO Kereyn Smith welcomed Hubbard to the contingent, while acknowledging the tensions.\n  &#34;As well as being among the world&#39;s best for her event, Laurel has met the IWF eligibility criteria including those based on IOC Consensus Statement guidelines for transgender athletes. We acknowledge that gender identity in sport is a highly sensitive and complex issue requiring a balance between human rights and fairness on the field of play,&#34; Smith said in a statement.\n      Chelsea Wolfe, a freestyle BMX rider, is an alternate for the U.S. women&#39;s squad. If one of the two riders ahead of her dropped out, she would be the first openly trans member of Team USA. The website Outsports  reported last month that there were at least nine trans or nonbinary athletes vying for spots on Olympic and Paralympic teams.\n  Bailar, the former Harvard swimmer, notes that the debate over trans women in sports often centers on questions of fairness and biological advantages.\n  &#34;Here&#39;s the thing: Sports are based on biological differences,&#34; he says. &#34;When we have athletes like Michael Phelps, who is tall \u2014 he&#39;s built for swimming. He has half the levels of lactic acid the average athlete produces, and nobody calls that unfair.&#34;\n  &#34;When women have biological differences, they are called unfair as opposed to when men do, they are just called superior athletes,&#34; Bailar says. &#34;The reality is that cis women even exhibit plenty of differences within sports. And that&#39;s not unfair. That&#39;s just differences in bodies.&#34;\n  In a  2017 interview with New Zealand news site Stuff, Hubbard noted that she competes under rules established by the International Olympic Committee in 2003 to allow transgender athletes to compete.\n  &#34;This isn&#39;t a new thing.

Gavin Newsom announced recently.\n The state&#39;s $5.2 billion in funds from Congressionally-approved aid packages is enough to pay off overdue rent, according to Newsom&#39;s senior counselor on housing and homelessness, Jason Elliott, the Associated Press reported. However, just $32 million out of $490 million in requests for rental assistance through May 31 have been covered so far, according to a California Department Housing and Community Development report.\n &#34;We should do our best to get back to the starting point where we were in December of 2019. Anything other than that is taking advantage of a crisis,&#34; said Keith Becker, a property manager in Sonoma County. He revealed that 14 tenants have not paid $100,000 worth of rent.\n   Newsom says California will pay off all past-due rent accumulated in the nation&#39;s most populated state because of the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, promising to make landlords whole.\n Left unsettled is whether California will continue to ban evictions for unpaid rent beyond June 30, a pandemic-related order that was meant to be temporary but is proving difficult to undo.\n Federal eviction protections also are set to expire on June 30. California had passed its own protections that applied to more people than the federal protections.\n Newsom and state legislative leaders are meeting privately regarding the protections, part of the negotiations over the state&#39;s roughly $260 billion operating budget. An extension of the eviction ban seems likely to give California more time to spend all the money to cover unpaid rent. But landlords and tenants&#39; rights groups are arguing over how long that extension should last.\n &#34;The expectation for people to be up and at &#39;em and ready to pay rent on July 1 is wholeheartedly unfair,&#34; said Kelli Lloyd, a 43-year-old single mother who says she has not worked consistently since the pandemic began in March 2020.\n Lloyd \u2014 a member of the advocacy group Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment \u2014 is supposed to pay $1,924 a month for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom rent-controlled apartment in the Crenshaw district of south Los Angeles. But she says she&#39;s $30,000 behind after not working for most of the last year to care for her two children as daycare centers closed and schools halted in-person learning.\n That debt will likely be covered by the government. But Lloyd said she recently lost a job at a real estate brokerage and hasn&#39;t found another one yet. She&#39;s worried she could be evicted if the protections expire.\n &#34;Simply because the state has opened back up doesn&#39;t mean people have access to their jobs,&#34; she said.\n Becker says the overdue rent payments put financial pressure on the owners, who he says have &#34;resigned themselves to it.&#34;\n But they have grown weary of the seemingly endless protections, which he noted were aimed at addressing a public health emergency and not meant to be permanent.\n The state has been slow to distribute the $5.2 billion, and it&#39;s unlikely it can spend it all by June 30. The California Department Housing and Community Development report doesn&#39;t include the 12 cities and 10 counties that run their own rental assistance programs.\n &#34;It&#39;s challenging to set up a new, big program overnight,&#34; said Assemblyman David Chiu, a Democrat from San Francisco and chair of the Assembly Housing and Community Development Committee. &#34;It has been challenging to educate millions of struggling tenants and landlords on what the law is.&#34;\n Landlords point to the state&#39;s rapid economic recovery as a reason not to extend the eviction moratorium much longer. California has added 495,000 new jobs since February. In April alone, California accounted for 38% of all new jobs in the U.S. This week, Newsom lifted all restrictions on businesses, heralding it as the state&#39;s grand reopening.\n &#34;We&#39;re getting back to normal,&#34; Carlton said. &#34;It&#39;s time to go back to work. It&#39;s time to pay the rent.&#34;\n While employment among middle- and high-wage jobs has exceeded pre-pandemic levels, employment rates for people earning less than $27,000 a year are down more than 38 percent since January 2020, according to Opportunity Insights, an economic tracker based at Harvard University.\n &#34;The stock market may be fine, we may be technically reopened, but people in low-wage jobs \u2014 which are disproportionately people of color \u2014 are not back yet,&#34; said Madeline Howard, senior attorney for the Western Center on Law and Poverty.\n Some housing advocates are asking the state to keep the eviction ban in place until the unemployment rate among low-wage workers has dropped to pre-pandemic levels. It&#39;s similar to how state officials would impose restrictions on businesses in counties where COVID-19 infection rates were higher while those with lower infection rates could reopen more quickly.\n Advocates say they were encouraged when Newsom told Univision earlier this month that he &#34;definitively&#34; wants to extend the eviction protections beyond June 30.\n &#34;We&#39;re cautiously optimistic,&#34; said Francisco Duenas, executive director of Housing Now California. &#34;We definitely need these protections as part of our recovery.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-22 11:40:49", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u507f\u8fd8,pay,\u4fdd\u62a4", "title": "CA\u507f\u8fd8\u5728Covid\u671f\u95f4\u7d2f\u8ba1\u7684\u6240\u6709\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u79df\u91d1\uff0c\u7ed9\u79df\u623f\u8005\u6e05\u6d01\u77f3\u677f ", "title_en": "CA to Pay Off All Past Due Rent Accrued During Covid, Giving Renters Clean Slate", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/california-pay-off-all-past-due-rent-accrued-during-covid-giving-renters-clean-slate-1602556", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u507f\u8fd8", "pay", "\u4fdd\u62a4"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "2cb3186b167af4fa0d7508de110c50b3.png", "infoid": 1067345, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u7684CCTV\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u5230\u4e00\u5bb6\u5c0f\u578b\u4fbf\u5229\u5e97\u7684\u804c\u5458\uff0c\u4ece\u51b7\u5374\u5668\u4e2d\u559d\u4e00\u74f6\u5496\u5561\u5e76\u559d\u5b83\u3002\u5f53\u4ed6\u8fd4\u56de\u6536\u94f6\u673a\u65f6\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u770b\u4e0d\u89c1\u7684\u4eba\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\u4ece\u5929\u82b1\u677f\u4e0a\u7684\u626c\u58f0\u5668\u53d1\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u8be2\u95ee\u4ed6\u662f\u5426\u626b\u63cf\u5e76\u652f\u4ed8\u8be5\u9879\u76ee\u3002\n    \u5728\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\uff0c\u6536\u94f6\u5458\u7ad9\u5728\u67dc\u53f0\u540e\u9762\u4e0e\u521a\u521a\u51fa\u5883\u7684\u4eba\u4ea4\u8c08\u3002\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\uff06\uff0339; ding\uff06\uff0339;\u58f0\u97f3\uff0c\u4ece\u4e0a\u9762\u63d0\u95ee\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\u5173\u4e8e\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u662f\u8c01 -

When he returns to the cash register, an unseen person&#39;s voice emits from a speaker on the ceiling and interrogates him about whether he scanned and paid for the item.\n    In another  video, a cashier is standing behind the counter talking to someone just out of frame. There\u2019s a &#39;ding&#39; sound, and the voice from above questions the cashier about who the other man is\u2014he\u2019s there to give the cashier a ride at the end of his shift\u2014then orders the man to stand on the other side of the counter.\n  The videos are just a few examples that Washington-based Live Eye Surveillance uses to demonstrate its flagship product: a surveillance camera system that keeps constant watch over shops and lets a remote human operator intervene whenever they see something they deem suspicious. For enough money\u2014$399 per month according to one sales email Motherboard viewed\u2014a person in Karnal, India will watch the video feed from your business 24/7. The monitors \u201cact as a virtual supervisor for the sites, in terms of assuring the safety of the employees located overseas and requesting them to complete assigned tasks,\u201d according to a  job posting on the company&#39;s website.\n  Live Eye is one of many companies profiting from the  increasing adoption of workplace surveillance tools during the pandemic, which human rights experts say corporations have exploited to introduce a wide array of spy tools in the name of safety.\n   \u201cWe\u2019re using insecurity about the risk of robbery as an excuse to target workers,\u201d Eva Blum-Dumontet, a senior researcher at Privacy International, told Motherboard. \u201cThis is really an excuse to reframe how we\u2019re working. Essentially what\u2019s happening with workplace surveillance is employers trying to keep track of their employees to make sure they match their idea of productivity. This is very toxic for the mental health of employees.\u201d\n      On its website, the company claims several major corporations as customers, including 7-Eleven, Shell, Dairy Queen, and Holiday Inn. Many of those businesses are franchised, and it isn\u2019t clear from Live Eye\u2019s materials whether the corporations have purchased the surveillance systems or if they\u2019ve been bought by individual franchise owners.\n  A former 7-Eleven field consultant who oversaw multiple stores told Motherboard he was concerned when a store owner showed them Live Eye Surveillance\u2019s promotional videos. The consultant, who asked to remain anonymous to protect their contacts still with the company, said that the surveillance system is a \u201csolution in search of a problem,\u201d because employee theft and shoplifting actually cost 7-Eleven franchise owners very little.\n  Even worse, the former field consultant said, the particular form of surveillance Live Eye is selling could actually be putting store workers in danger.\n  In  one of the sample videos Live Eye sends potential customers, two black-clad robbers, one carrying an assault rifle, run into what appears to be a 7-Eleven store and force the clerk behind the counter. As the clerk starts to open the cash register, the Live Eye system dings and a voice informs the robbers that the police have been called. They run out of the store.\n  \u201cThat\u2019s how someone is going to get killed,\u201d the former field consultant said. \u201cYou don\u2019t startle someone with an assault rifle. That violates 7-Eleven policy. There\u2019s a reason why the silent alarm is silent\u201d at banks and other businesses.\n  7-Eleven did not respond to Motherboard\u2019s questions about whether it condones the use of Live Eye\u2019s systems. The company did provide a statement saying: \u201c7-Eleven, Inc. cares deeply about the safety of our associates and customers. We provide every 7-Eleven store with a base security system that includes CCTV and alarms, however, independent franchise owners can install their own system on top of what is provided.&#34;\n  The pandemic has driven the spread of workplace surveillance tools for both blue and white collar workers, Blum-Dumontet said, but it has a disproportionate impact on low-paid employees.\n  \u201cThere are a lot of people who have lost their jobs, a lot of people who don\u2019t have much choice whether to accept a job or not,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is why employers are getting away with opting for these forms of surveillance that take a real toll on employees.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-22 11:40:30", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

", "note_en": "Of the natural hazards in Mother Nature\u2019s arsenal, tornadoes are some of the most vicious. But while\u00a0other hazards are regularly considered in building designs, tornadoes have not been part of the equation for most structures in the United States, even in highly tornado-prone regions. Now, an upcoming edition of a critical building standard gives tornadoes some much needed attention.\n The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) has released a draft version of the 2022 edition of ASCE 7 for public feedback ahead of its final publication in December. This  building standard helps engineers determine the loads (or forces) their building should be able to withstand, whether from a hurricane, earthquake, flood or snow. With the new edition, tornadoes may soon join that list, thanks to research spearheaded by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).\n The draft of the new edition features first-of-a-kind tornado hazard maps meant to guide the design of critical facilities, such as schools, fire stations and hospitals, based on their size and geographic location.\n \u201cIf the standard is ultimately adopted into the building code, it will provide some much-needed basic protection against tornadoes, reducing damages and accelerating recovery especially in the central and southeastern U.S.,\u201d said NIST research structural engineer Marc Levitan, who chairs the ASCE task committee that developed ASCE 7\u2019s new tornado load chapter.\n Tornadoes cause  more deaths per year than earthquakes and hurricanes combined. And storms spawning tornadoes surpass the collective  annual insured losses of hurricanes and tropical storms. But, barring tornado shelters and nuclear power plants, building designs have historically not accounted for tornadoes. The extraordinary strength of tornadoes and a common perception that the risk of being struck by one is low have fed into a misconception that addressing tornadoes in building designs would be far too costly.\n That mindset started to shift in 2011, when a  record-breaking tornado season wreaked havoc across the U.S. NIST  thoroughly investigated one of the worst events that year, a tornado rated as the most severe on the Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale \u2014 an EF5 \u2014 that ripped through Joplin, Missouri. Among the more than 8,000 buildings damaged in the tornado\u2019s wake were schools, big-box stores, nursing homes, fire stations and a major hospital, which was eventually demolished.\n The NIST team, led by Levitan, found that although the most powerful winds laid waste to buildings near the tornado center, more than 70% of the total damage path stemmed from lower wind speeds farther out. And designing for that level of wind is much more economically viable.\n \u201cBuilding codes and standards don\u2019t require design for the worst possible hurricanes and earthquakes. We need to apply that same philosophy to tornadoes and design for the more modest and more common tornado design speeds,\u201d said Levitan.\n ASCE 7 already contains hazard maps for hurricanes and other windstorms that prescribe wind speeds to be considered in the design of buildings in different areas throughout the country. Engineers use these maps to identify strong winds their building might encounter and then, using other sections of the standard, calculate how much pressure that wind will apply to elements of their building, including its frame, walls and roof.\n NIST researchers, working with engineers from Applied Research Associates Inc., sought to establish a similar process for tornadoes. But first they had to obtain a great deal of information about where and how often twisters occur and how much their winds push and pull on building components.\n The researchers, among other efforts, analyzed and filled in gaps in more than 60 years of tornado records, studied how miniature buildings responded to small-scale vortexes in the lab and performed extensive computer-based structural modeling. And by analyzing damage from Joplin and other tornadoes they were able to back up the performance of their models with real-world data. Then they used their findings to develop tornado hazard maps and methods to help engineers determine what forces their structure would need to stand up against.\n The guidance, which now appears in the draft version of ASCE 7, is only required for buildings located in the tornado-prone region of the country, east of the Rocky Mountains, and only for buildings defined as risk categories III or IV. ASCE describes structures in category III as being those that could represent a substantial hazard to human life if they fail. Category IV includes essential facilities.\n For risk category III buildings, which include schools and other high-occupancy structures, the standard requires engineers to use maps with wind speeds that have about a 3% chance of being surpassed at least once in 50 years \u2014 a common target for service life in building design   . That tolerance tightens to 1.7% for vital category IV buildings, such as hospitals or fire stations. The standard also provides additional maps with even higher wind speeds for communities aiming to design sturdier buildings that exceed the minimum requirements.\n The maps account for building size too. Their tornado wind speeds change depending on the area of a structure\u2019s footprint, reflecting the fact that the larger the structure is, the more likely it is to be struck by tornadoes.\n Once the 2022 edition of ASCE 7 is finalized this December, tornado-prone regions, many of which may have been brutalized by violent twisters in the past, will have the guidance to design new buildings to better weather the next assault. And if the standard is adopted by the model building codes (maintained by independent codes and standards organizations) and those codes are incorporated into U.S. state and local buildings codes, the new practices will become widespread, saving lives and property from one of nature\u2019s most vicious threats.\n The  draft standard is available for download from the ASCE website (free registration required). Individuals and organizations can  provide feedback on the standard through ASCE\u2019s public comment system until July 31, 2021.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 11:40:08", "source_domain":

revealed the company\u2019s new supercomputer that allows the automaker to ditch radar and lidar sensors on self-driving cars in favor of high-quality optical cameras. During his workshop on autonomous driving, Karpathy explained that to get a computer to respond to new environment in a way that a human can requires an immense dataset, and a massively powerful supercomputer to train the company\u2019s neural net-based autonomous driving technology using that data set. Hence the development of these predecessors to Dojo.\n Tesla\u2019s newest-generation supercomputer has 10 petabytes of \u201chot tier\u201d NVME storage and runs at 1.6 terrabytes per second, according to Karpathy. With 1.8 EFLOPS, he said it might be the fifth most powerful supercomputer in the world, but he conceded later that his team has not yet run the specific benchmark necessary to enter the TOP500 Supercomputing rankings.\n  \u201cThat said, if you take the total number of FLOPS it would indeed place somewhere around the fifth spot,\u201d Karpathy told TechCrunch. \u201cThe fifth spot is currently occupied by NVIDIA with their Selene cluster, which has a very comparable architecture and similar number of GPUs (4480 vs ours 5760, so a bit less).\u201d\n Musk has been advocating for a vision-only approach to autonomy for some time, in large part because   cameras are faster than radar or lidar . As of May, Tesla Model Y and Model 3 vehicles in North America are being built without radar, relying on cameras and machine learning to support its advanced driver assistance system and autopilot.\n When radar and vision disagree, which one do you believe? Vision has much more precision, so better to double down on vision than do sensor fusion.\n Many autonomous driving companies use lidar and high definition maps, which means they require incredibly detailed maps of the places where they\u2019re operating, including all road lanes and how they connect, traffic lights and more.\n \u201cThe approach we take is vision-based, primarily using neural networks that can in principle function anywhere on earth,\u201d said Karpathy in his workshop.\n Replacing a \u201cmeat computer,\u201d or rather, \u00a0a human, with a silicon computer results in lower latencies (better reaction time), 360 degree situational awareness and a fully attentive driver that never checks their Instagram, said Karpathy.\n  Karpathy shared some scenarios of how Tesla\u2019s supercomputer employs computer vision to correct bad driver behavior, including an emergency braking scenario in which the computer\u2019s object detection kicks in to save a pedestrian from being hit, and traffic control warning that can identify a yellow light in the distance and send an alert to a driver that hasn\u2019t yet started to slow down.\n Tesla vehicles have also already proven a feature called pedal misapplication mitigation, in which the car identifies pedestrians in its path, or even a lack of a driving path, and responds to the driver accidentally stepping on the gas instead of braking, potentially saving pedestrians in front of the vehicle or preventing the driver from accelerating into a river.\n Tesla\u2019s supercomputer collects video from eight cameras that surround the vehicle at 36 frames per second, which provides insane amounts of information about the environment surrounding the car, Karpathy explained.\n While the vision-only approach is more scalable than collecting, building and maintaining high definition maps everywhere in the world, it\u2019s also much more of a challenge, because the neural networks doing the object detection and handling the driving have to be able to collect and process vast quantities of data at speeds that match the depth and velocity recognition capabilities of a human.\n Karpathy says after years of research, he believes it can be done by treating the challenge as a supervised learning problem.  Engineers testing the tech found they could drive around sparsely populated areas with zero interventions, said Karpathy, but \u201cdefinitely struggle a lot more in very adversarial environments like San Francisco.\u201d For the system to truly work well and mitigate the need for things like high-definition maps and additional sensors, it\u2019ll have to get much better at dealing with densely populated areas.\n One of the Tesla AI team game changers has been auto-labeling, through which it can automatically label things like roadway hazards and other objects from millions of videos capture by vehicles on Tesla camera. Large AI datasets have often required a lot of manual labelling, which is time-consuming, especially when trying to arrive at the kind of cleanly-labelled data set required to make a supervised learning system on a neural network work well.\n With this latest supercomputer, Tesla has accumulated 1 million videos of around 10 seconds each and labeled 6 billion objects with depth, velocity and acceleration. All of this takes up a whopping 1.5 petabytes of storage. That seems like a massive amount, but it\u2019ll take a lot more before the company can achieve the kind of reliability it requires out of an automated driving system that relies on vision systems alone, hence the need to continue developing ever more powerful supercomputers in Tesla\u2019s pursuit of more advanced AI.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 10:58:36", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7279\u65af\u62c9,\u613f\u666f,backs,\u9a7e\u9a76", "title": "\u7279\u65af\u62c9\u652f\u6301\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8d85\u7ea7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7684\u613f\u666f\u63a2\u8ba8 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tTesla backs vision-only approach to autonomy using powerful supercomputer\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/tesla-backs-vision-only-approach-to-autonomy-using-powerful-supercomputer/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7279\u65af\u62c9", "\u613f\u666f", "backs", "\u9a7e\u9a76"]}]
