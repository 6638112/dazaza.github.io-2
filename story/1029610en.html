Instead, we think of technology as being used to express media, rather than media itself. Spotify, for example, is an  internet  streaming music service, while iTunes is a  download music service, SiriusXM is  satellite  broadcast music service, and radio is a  terrestrial broadcast technology. This focus on delivery ignores the classic definition of media: “ outlets or  tools used to  store and  deliver information or data.”</p><p>由于大多数主要的媒体类别-音乐、视频和视频游戏-已经存在了几十年，我们往往会忘记媒体就是技术。相反，我们认为技术是用来表达媒体的，而不是媒体本身。例如，Spotify是互联网流媒体音乐服务，而iTunes是下载音乐服务，SiriusXM是卫星广播音乐服务，无线电是地面广播技术。这种对交付的关注忽略了媒体的经典定义：“用于存储和交付信息或数据的出口或工具。”</p><p> While the above might seem preoccupied with theory and philosophy, all analysis of the past and future of a given media category must start from the fact that media is technology. This is because technology not only enables content categories, it defines their business models and shapes the content, too. And as we know, technology is in a constant process of change.</p><p>虽然以上内容看起来似乎都是理论和哲学的问题，但所有对特定媒体类别的过去和未来的分析都必须从媒体就是技术这一事实开始。这是因为技术不仅使内容分类成为可能，还定义了它们的商业模式并塑造了内容。正如我们所知，技术正处于一个不断变化的过程中。</p><p>   Music offers a great view into the interplay between technology, business model and content. Consider the following triptych, which covers seven decades, two decades and one year, respectively.</p><p>音乐为技术、商业模式和内容之间的相互作用提供了一个很好的视角。请看下面的三联画，分别涵盖70年、20年和1年。</p><p>  When the flat record first emerged in the 1850s, it standardized around the 78. The 78 (as in 78 rotations per minute) came in a 10-inch version that held three minutes of music and a 12-inch version that held four. This meant that after centuries of variability, music suddenly had a defined run-time.</p><p>当平坦的记录在19世纪50年代首次出现时，它的标准是78。78(也就是每分钟78转)有10英寸的版本，可以容纳3分钟的音乐，而12英寸的版本可以容纳4分钟的音乐。这意味着，在经历了几个世纪的变化无常之后，音乐突然有了一个明确的运行时间。</p><p> This length was reaffirmed by the first mass market standard for consumer media: the 45 RPM vinyl single, which launched in 1948 and held roughly three minutes. The music industry coalesced around this format (and its runtime) for a variety of tech-based reasons. The 45 was far cheaper for consumers than a 78 album, which was important given the high cost of record players and the ubiquity of free (singles-focused) radio. The 45’s cost advantage also meant it was the primary way labels delivered singles to thousands of radio stations across the country for local airplay. In addition, RCA quickly figured out how to make a stackable version of 45s, which was important to jukebox manufacturers. The rise of the 45 naturally led the length of the average song to decline; a four-minute song simply couldn’t fit on the most important audio format in the world.</p><p>这一长度在第一个面向消费媒体的大众市场标准：1948年推出的45RPM乙烯基单曲中得到了重申，大约持续了3分钟。出于各种基于技术的原因，音乐行业围绕这种格式(以及它的运行时)进行了联合。对于消费者来说，45要比78专辑便宜得多，考虑到唱片播放器的高昂成本和免费(以单曲为中心的)收音机的无处不在，这一点很重要。45的成本优势也意味着它是唱片公司将单曲交付给全国数千家广播电台进行本地播放的主要方式。此外，RCA很快就想出了如何制造可堆叠版本的45，这对自动点唱机制造商来说很重要。45位歌手的崛起自然导致了平均歌曲时长的下降；一首4分钟的歌曲根本无法适应世界上最重要的音频格式。</p><p> As the physical and financial limitations of the 78 and 45 were relieved, and the far more flexible cassette and CD emerged, the length of the average single grew rapidly, adding nearly two minutes (or 78%) from 1959 to 1992. Still, almost all tracks conformed to the three-to-four minute standard. After decades, the West had become used to the idea that a song was roughly between three minutes and 20 seconds and four minutes and 10 seconds long.</p><p>随着78和45的物理和经济限制被解除，更灵活的盒式磁带和CD出现，平均单曲长度迅速增长，从1959年到1992年增加了近两分钟(或78%)。尽管如此，几乎所有的赛道都符合三到四分钟的标准。几十年后，西方已经习惯了一首歌的长度大致在3分到20秒和4分10秒之间的想法。</p><p> On its surface, the shift to digital audio should have led to further increases in song length. After all, there was no longer any limitation to run-time. However, the reverse occurred. Technology might have relaxed its grip on music’s length, but it had strengthened its hold on business models.</p><p>从表面上看，转向数字音频应该会导致歌曲长度的进一步增加。毕竟，对运行时不再有任何限制。然而，情况恰恰相反。科技可能放松了对音乐长度的控制，但它加强了对商业模式的控制。</p><p> As is well known, iTunes unbundled the physical album in individually downloadable (and bought) tracks. But in doing so, it penalized artists for bundling a multi-part song into a single track. Pink Floyd’s decision to split the 26-minute and nine-part Shine on You Crazy Diamond into two discrete tracks didn’t matter in 1975; all nine parts fit on a single record and no one wanted to buy just a single half let alone a single part. But in 2005, such a move could mean missing out on 75% of revenues — why sell two things when you could sell nine? And why would a consumer buy an entire $10 album if all they wanted was two $1 portions of Shine on You Crazy Diamond? These incentives naturally led to artists that were publishing new music to split their longer/multi-section songs into separate — and shorter — preludes, interludes and segments.</p><p>众所周知，iTunes将实体专辑分成单独下载(和购买)的曲目。但在这样做的过程中，它惩罚了将一首多声部歌曲捆绑在一首曲目中的艺术家。1975年，平克·弗洛伊德(Pink Floyd)决定将“闪耀在你疯狂的钻石”(Share On You Crazy Diamond)的26分钟和9个部分分成两首独立的曲目，这一决定在1975年并不重要；所有9个部分都适合一张唱片，没有人想只买一半，更不用说只买一个部分了。但在2005年，这样的举动可能意味着错失75%的收入-当你可以卖出9个东西的时候，为什么要卖两个东西呢？如果消费者只想要两张1美元的Shine on You Crazy Diamond，为什么他们要买一整张10美元的专辑呢？这些激励措施自然而然地导致了发行新音乐的艺术家将他们的较长/多节歌曲分成单独的-和较短的-前奏曲、插曲和片段。</p><p> This behaviour has been greatly exacerbated by the advent of a new and even more disruptive digital music technology: on-demand streaming. While iTunes was technically innovative, its business model was not. Consumers, after all, primarily owned copies of individual tracks in the 1950s and 1960s. Spotify and Apple Music, meanwhile, meant consumers adopted not just a new music technology, but also bought an entirely different product: ongoing access to all music ever created.</p><p>一种新的、更具颠覆性的数字音乐技术：点播流媒体的出现，大大加剧了这种行为。虽然iTunes在技术上是创新的，但它的商业模式并非如此。毕竟，在20世纪50年代和60年代，消费者主要拥有个人曲目的副本。与此同时，Spotify和Apple Music意味着消费者不仅采用了一种新的音乐技术，还购买了一种完全不同的产品：持续访问所有曾经创作的音乐。</p><p> But as technology has shifted consumers away from discrete and attributable transactions (buying record A on date B) to ongoing and general ones (subscribing to service C in perpetuity), musical talent needed a new compensation model. Spotify, therefore, decided to pay talent as and to the degree consumers listened to their works. Matching revenue with usage is intuitive, but it was never before possible in music. There was no way to track at-home record spins or CD plays, let alone charge for them. Nor was it practical for iTunes to ask users to download an individual song to their devices and pay several pennies per play when they later synched their iPod to iTunes. (This would have been rife with abuse, too.)</p><p>但随着技术将消费者从离散的、可归属的交易(在日期B购买唱片A)转移到持续的、一般的交易(永久订阅C服务)，音乐人才需要一种新的薪酬模式。因此，Spotify决定根据消费者收听他们作品的程度向人才付费。将收入与使用量相匹配是直观的，但在音乐界以前是不可能的。没有办法跟踪在家录制的旋转或CD播放，更不用说收费了。对于iTunes来说，当用户稍后将iPod同步到iTunes时，要求用户将一首单独的歌曲下载到他们的设备上，并支付每次播放几便士的费用也是不切实际的。(这也会充斥着滥用。)。</p><p> Engagement-based monetization is arguably more fair. Consider, for example, that the Beatles’  Yesterday and Psy’s  Gangnam Style would each generate $1 when sold on iTunes, even if the former was played 2,000 times over ten years and the latter 30 times in the month it was bought and then never again. But the more that business models change, the more that incentives and content change, too.</p><p>基于参与度的货币化可以说更公平。例如，假设披头士乐队的“昨日”和朴槿惠的“江南Style”在iTunes上出售时各能赚到1美元，即使前者在十年内被播放了2000次，后者在购买的当月被播放了30次，然后就再也没有了。但是，商业模式改变得越多，激励措施和内容也改变得越多。</p><p> To support engagement-based monetization, Spotify and its label suppliers had to define engagement. And they chose to do this on a per stream basis with a minimum stream time of 30 seconds (to avoid accidental plays, track skipping, etc.). However, this meant that a 10-minute track, five-minute track and 31-second track generated the same royalties.</p><p>为了支持基于参与度的货币化，Spotify及其标签供应商必须定义参与度。他们选择在每个流的基础上进行此操作，最短流时间为30秒(以避免意外播放、跳轨等)。然而，这意味着10分钟的曲目、5分钟的曲目和31秒的曲目产生的版税是相同的。</p><p> So as the music industry has transitioned the majority of its revenues from CDs and downloads to streaming, major artists have relentlessly shortened and split their tracks. Why release a five-minute song if you can make it a two and a half-minute song that’s played twice? Or two different two and a half-minute songs? This meant artists had yet another reason to reduce track lengths</p><p>因此，随着音乐产业将其大部分收入从CD和下载过渡到流媒体，主要艺术家们无情地缩短和拆分了他们的曲目。如果你能让一首两分半钟的歌播放两次，为什么要发行一首五分钟的歌呢？还是两首不同的两分半钟的歌？这意味着艺术家们又多了一个缩短赛道长度的理由。</p><p> All of this helps to explain the extraordinary success of the 2019’s top track,  Old Town Road by Lil Nas X, which is also Billboard’s longest running #1 ever, at 19 consecutive weeks. While the song is awesome, it’s also only one minute and 53 seconds — roughly half of 2019’s average song length. This means that four minutes of listening generated two times the average revenue and charting lift of every other hit song that year.</p><p>所有这些都有助于解释2019年顶级赛道，Lil Nas X的老城区路(Old City Road)取得了非凡的成功，这也是公告牌有史以来运行时间最长的#1，连续19周。虽然这首歌很棒，但它也只有1分53秒-大约是2019年平均歌曲时长的一半。这意味着，四分钟的收听产生的平均收入和排行榜上的提振是当年所有其他热门歌曲的两倍。</p><p> Old Town Road isn’t an exception, either. Up until 2017, Billboard’s Hot 100 Chart has never had a year with more than 2% of its charting tracks shorter than two minutes and 30 seconds (most years had none). In the past three years, this sum has skyrocketed to over 12%, or roughly one in every eight tracks.</p><p>老城区路也不例外。直到2017年，“公告牌百强排行榜”从未有一年的排行榜超过2分30秒(大多数年份都没有)。在过去的三年里，这个数字飙升到了12%以上，或者说大约每八个音轨中就有一个。</p><p> Notably, labels are also encouraging artists to simplify the name of their songs and albums in order to ensure they’re optimized for voice-controlled speakers and touchscreen-based searches. A track with five words is more likely to be misunderstood or suffer from autocorrect than one with two. Similarly, voice assistants are known to struggle with  accents, such as Irish or even Texan. Being hard to say means you might not get played.</p><p>值得注意的是，唱片公司还鼓励艺术家简化他们的歌曲和专辑的名称，以确保它们针对声控扬声器和基于触摸屏的搜索进行了优化。包含五个单词的曲目比包含两个单词的曲目更容易被误解或遭受自动更正。同样，众所周知，语音助理很难克服爱尔兰甚至德克萨斯口音。难说意味着你可能不会被耍。</p><p> Old Town Road isn’t the first time technology made a hit. In fact, the modern day dominance of rap and R&amp;B comes from how changes in technology – not for delivery, but sales recognition –  afforded Lil Nas X the opportunity to top the charts in the first place.</p><p>老城区路并不是科技第一次大行其道。事实上，RAP和R&Amp；B如今的主导地位来自于技术的变化--不是为了交付，而是为了获得销售认可--这让Lil Nas X从一开始就有机会登上排行榜榜首。</p><p> Prior to the 1990s, Black artists and music fans had spent decades arguing the record industry conspired against “urban contemporary” music by refusing it radio play and ignoring its sales. It took only five weeks after Billboard adopted SoundScan, a computerized sales database, to prove this theory right.</p><p>在20世纪90年代之前，黑人艺术家和乐迷们花了几十年的时间辩称，唱片行业通过拒绝广播剧和忽视其销售，密谋反对“城市当代”音乐。在“公告牌”采用SoundScan(一种计算机化的销售数据库)后，仅用了五周的时间就证明了这一理论是正确的。</p><p> Until 1991, Billboard charts weren’t based on actual unit sales or radio play. Instead, it was assembled using (white) retail clerk estimates of what was selling best and what (white) DJs considered to be “ hottest” each week. According to  The Atlantic, both groups had  reasons to lie. For example, labels would pressure radio stations to favour “hand-picked hits” if they wanted to keep receiving the newest single on time (stations sometimes  received bribes to play specific tracks, too). Meanwhile, labels would force inventory on their retailers, who would then overreport sales to convince music fans to buy excess inventory.</p><p>直到1991年，“公告牌”排行榜都不是基于实际销量或广播剧。相反，它是通过(白人)零售员估计哪些是最畅销的，哪些(白人)DJ每周被认为是“最热的”来组装的。据“大西洋月刊”报道，这两组人都有撒谎的理由。例如，唱片公司会向电台施压，要求它们支持“亲手挑选的歌曲”，如果他们想继续按时接收最新单曲的话(电台有时也会收受贿赂，让它们播放特定的曲目)。与此同时，唱片公司会强迫零售商进行库存，然后零售商会多报销售额，以说服乐迷购买多余的库存。</p><p> Naturally, those who ran the music industry saw little need to overhaul how it worked. And thus while the book and film industries had shifted to computerized sales databases in the 1980s, not one of the top six record distributors signed onto SoundScan before its release in June 1991. But this resistance didn’t stop N.W.A.’s  N***az4life from debuting #2 on the Billboard Top 100 the very next month under SoundScan. This was the highest charting performance in rap history – and happened without any radio airplay, music video airings on MTV, or a concert tour. The failings of the old honour system were further demonstrated by the fact that N.W.A. debuted at only #21 on Billboard’s R&amp;B chart, which wasn’t yet on SoundScan. Somehow it was possible that  N***az4life was the second biggest album in the country by units purchased, but 21st in its own genre when it came to what was “selling” and “hottest.” One week after it’s release, the album hit #1 on the Billboard chart (displacing R.E.M) as hundreds of thousands flocked to the record store in search of the “surprise” hit.</p><p>当然，那些管理音乐行业的人认为没有必要彻底改革它的运作方式。因此，虽然图书和电影业在20世纪80年代已经转向计算机化的销售数据库，但在1991年6月SoundScan发行之前，前六大唱片发行商中没有一家签署了SoundScan。但这种阻力并没有阻止N.W.A.的N*az4life在下个月的SoundScan下首次登上公告牌百强排行榜的第二名。这是说唱历史上最高的排行榜表演-而且没有任何电台播放，MTV播放音乐视频，或者巡回演唱会。N.W.A.在公告牌R&A；B排行榜上的首次亮相仅排在第21位，这一事实进一步证明了旧荣誉制度的缺陷，而这一排行榜还没有出现在SoundScan上。不知何故，按销量计算，N*az4life可能是美国第二大专辑，但在“畅销”和“最热”方面，它在自己的流派中排名第21。发行一周后，这张专辑登上了公告牌排行榜的榜首(取代了R.E.M)，数十万人蜂拥至唱片店寻找这首“令人惊讶”的热门歌曲。</p><p> In the following years, the R&amp;B/hip hop genre  achieved three other industry “firsts.&#34; It saw the fastest rise from a non-top ten genre to Billboard’s most popular one, has been the most dominant #1 by share, and holds the longest run as #1 (note the chart below ends in 2010, but this reign persists through to date).</p><p>在接下来的几年里，R&Amp；B/嘻哈音乐还取得了另外三个行业“第一”。它见证了从非前十名上升到“公告牌”最受欢迎类型的最快速度，一直是市场占有率最高的#1，并保持了最长的排名第一(请注意，下面的图表将于2010年结束，但这种统治一直持续到目前为止)。</p><p>  Even the Beatles, though doubtlessly destined for success, were elevated by changing technology. Between 1954 and 1962, 5.5 million transistor radios were sold in the United States. In 1963 this install base nearly doubled to 10 million, many of which were received as Christmas gifts. The top use case (or “killer app”) for this newly ubiquitous device? Listening to the Beatles’  I Want to Hold Your Hand, which was coincidentally released for radio play on December 26th. Within a month, the song had become the Beatles’ first Billboard #1, thereby landing the group its February appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show and jump-starting Beatlemania.</p><p>即使是披头士乐队，尽管毫无疑问注定会成功，但也是通过不断变化的技术来提升的。从1954年到1962年，美国售出了550万台晶体管收音机。1963年，这一安装量几乎翻了一番，达到1000万台，其中许多都是作为圣诞礼物收到的。这种新的无处不在的设备的最大用例(或“杀手级应用”)是什么？收听披头士乐队的歌曲“我想牵着你的手”，这首歌巧合地在12月26日播出。不到一个月，这首歌就成为披头士乐队的第一个公告牌#1，从而使乐队在2月份的埃德·沙利文秀(Ed Sullivan Show)上亮相，并迅速启动了披头士狂热。</p><p> Sixty years later, the significance of the transistor radio is easy to forget, or to otherwise lump in with less disruptive 20th century audio inventions such as the 8-track or cassette deck. However, the device “ was the technological spark that lit the fuse of teen culture in the 60s,” CBS wrote in 2014. “It enabled both public and private listening behaviours in a combination equaled by neither prior nor subsequent technologies. Public, because you could take it anywhere and share music with your friends in the schoolyard, on the beach, wherever, in an unprecedented fashion. Private, because you could listen through an earplug as you walked down the street, or sat in the back of the class, or lay in your bed at night, under the covers, so your parents wouldn’t know.” It is difficult to think of an artist or group that better deserved the promotional platform that the transistor radio offered the Beatles. However, no amount of marketing spend could have bought the band such an enormous opportunity — only technology.</p><p>六十年后，晶体管收音机的重要性很容易被遗忘，否则就很容易与破坏性较小的20世纪音频发明(如8声道或盒式录音机)混为一谈。然而，CBS在2014年写道，这款设备“是点燃60年代青少年文化导火索的技术火花”。他说：“它能够实现公共和私人的倾听行为，这一组合既不是以前的技术也不是后来的技术所能比拟的。公众，因为你可以把它带到任何地方，在学校操场上，在海滩上，任何地方，以前所未有的方式与你的朋友分享音乐。私人的，因为你可以通过耳塞听你走在街上，或者坐在教室的后排，或者晚上躺在床上，盖着被子，这样你的父母就不会知道了。“。很难想象有哪位艺术家或乐队比晶体管收音机为披头士提供的宣传平台更配得上了。然而，再多的营销支出也买不到这支乐队如此巨大的仅限机会的技术。</p><p>   Although music offers many examples of how changes in media technology lead to changed business models and content, the category is nevertheless considered a tragic outlier in the media industry because of its  economic non-responsiveness to technology.</p><p>虽然音乐提供了许多例子来说明媒体技术的变化如何导致商业模式和内容的变化，但由于它在经济上对技术没有反应，这一类别在媒体行业被认为是一个悲惨的异类。</p><p> Consider the chart below, which shows how recorded music technologies have spanned six different mediums (vinyl, 8-track, cassette, disc, offline download, streaming) across a seven-decade period, but only to see industry revenues replaced at best and reduced at worst. This is despite the fact that new genres were created, new sounds and instruments emerged, and monetization was transformed twice over. Note, too, that the core listening experience was also continuously improved: cassettes brought portability to recorded music, CDs brought quality and defined track starts/stops, downloads meant your entire library traveled with you and streaming meant the entire library of music was available at all times. In fact, these advances were so great that audiences spent billions re-buying music they already owned on a new format. But re-buying old music isn’t a growth market.</p><p>看看下面的图表，它显示了唱片音乐技术如何在70年的时间里跨越了6种不同的媒体(黑胶、8轨、盒式磁带、光盘、离线下载和流媒体)，但只看到行业收入充其量被取代，在最坏的情况下减少。尽管新的流派被创造出来，新的声音和乐器出现了，货币化也发生了两次转变，但这仍然是事实。还要注意的是，核心的收听体验也在不断改进：盒式磁带为录制的音乐带来了便携性，CD带来了高质量和明确的曲目开始/停止，下载意味着您的整个曲库都可以随身携带，而流媒体则意味着整个曲库随时都可以使用。事实上，这些进步是如此巨大，以至于观众花费数十亿美元重新购买他们已经拥有的新格式的音乐。但重新购买旧音乐并不是一个成长型市场。</p><p>  Compare the audio chart to video, which grew with the addition of broadcast TV atop film, cable television atop broadcast, with satellite and fibre-optic video driving further gains, and now digital video. Netflix might be disrupting Hollywood and cord cutting might be at all-time highs, but video revenues have never been greater.</p><p>将音频图表与视频进行比较，后者随着广播电视的增加而增长，在电影的基础上，有线电视在广播的基础上，卫星和光纤视频进一步推动了收益，现在又增加了数字视频。Netflix可能正在颠覆好莱坞，剪线可能创下历史新高，但视频收入从未像现在这样大。</p><p> This is because over-the-top video, as with prior video innovations, did more than just discover new genres and talent. It fundamentally  transformed video delivery, creation and monetization, as well as the video content itself.</p><p>这是因为过头的视频，就像之前的视频创新一样，不仅仅是发现了新的流派和人才。它从根本上改变了视频交付、创作和货币化，以及视频内容本身。</p><p>  It was obvious that the addition of at-home viewership would expand the video market. However, the first technology used to deliver it, broadcast, had many great advantages. Chief among them was ubiquitous coverage and no marginal costs. Every household in a given area – and every room in the household – received a broadcast transmission from a single tower. In addition, there was no cost to setting up a household nor sending content. This meant that broadcast TV was easy to get and could also be free. These two attributes enabled TV to penetrate the American market at an unprecedented rate. Only two in 10 Americans had seen a television in operation in 1945. By 1950, one in 10 owned one, and by 1962, nine in ten did.</p><p>很明显，家庭观众的增加将扩大视频市场。然而，用来传送它的第一项技术，广播，有许多巨大的优势。其中最主要的是覆盖无处不在，没有边际成本。给定区域内的每个家庭--以及家庭中的每个房间--都会收到来自一座塔楼的广播传输。此外，建立家庭和发送内容都没有成本。这意味着广播电视很容易获得，也可以是免费的。这两个特性使电视以前所未有的速度渗透到美国市场。1945年，只有2/10的美国人看过正在运行的电视。到1950年，十分之一的人拥有一辆，到1962年，十分之一的人拥有。</p><p> However, broadcast had significant constraints. For example, there was only enough broadcast spectrum for a few channels. There was no ability to customer discriminate – every customer received the same service, or none at all – or charge, either. These limitations meant that rather than sell consumers entertainment, the video industry effectively bought consumer attention with entertainment and then sold this attention to third parties through ads. Thus the focus of competition was not the best content, but reaching the most viewers at any point. There was no space – literally – for niche or specialty programming, nor content that might offend advertisers, the sole source of revenues. Broadcast distribution also meant all content aired live. As a result, all shows ran exactly 30 or 60 minutes, including ads, which informed how long an act or scene might be.</p><p>然而，广播有很大的限制。例如，广播频谱仅够少数几个频道使用。没有能力区分客户-每个客户都得到了相同的服务，或者根本没有-或者也没有收费。这些限制意味着，视频行业并没有向消费者出售娱乐，而是有效地用娱乐购买了消费者的注意力，然后通过广告将这种关注卖给了第三方。因此，竞争的焦点不是最好的内容，而是任何时候都能接触到最多的观众。从字面上讲，没有空间给利基或专业节目，也没有可能冒犯广告商的内容，广告商是唯一的收入来源。广播分发也意味着所有内容都是现场直播的。结果，所有的节目都恰好运行了30或60分钟，包括广告，这些广告告知了一幕或一场戏可能有多长。</p><p> Cable removed a number of broadcast restraints. For the first time in TV history, it was now possible to discriminate between households and charge, too. Neighbour A might get no cable service, Neighbour B a basic tier, and Neighbour C a premium one. This meant that television could add a new business model: consumer fees. Coaxial cable massively expanded the number of concurrent video feeds a household could receive. These two changes allowed new TV networks that focused on serving niche populations rather than the broadest possible audience to emerge, including ESPN, CNN, MTV, BET and HBO. These channels, in turn, helped convince audiences to abandon free TV for pay TV. It also helped increase TV watch time. While the share of U.S. homes with TV didn’t grow from 1961 to 2010, usage jumped from five hours to eight and a half hours per day. Nobody liked their cable bill, but they sure liked what it got them. The more they watched, the more money they paid, and the more content the industry could produce and the better it could be.</p><p>有线电视消除了一些广播限制。在电视史上，现在也可以区分家庭和收费，这是第一次。邻居A可能没有有线电视服务，邻居B是基本等级，邻居C是高级等级。这意味着电视可以增加一种新的商业模式：消费者收费。同轴电缆极大地增加了一个家庭可以接收的并发视频源的数量。这两个变化使得专注于服务于利基人群而不是尽可能广泛的受众的新电视网络出现，包括ESPN、CNN、MTV、BET和HBO。反过来，这些频道帮助说服了观众放弃免费电视，转而选择付费电视。这也有助于增加看电视的时间。虽然从1961年到2010年，美国家庭中有电视的比例没有增长，但使用量却从每天5个小时跃升至8个半小时。没有人喜欢他们的有线电视账单，但他们肯定喜欢它给他们带来的东西。他们看的越多，他们支付的钱就越多，这个行业可以生产的内容越多，就可以变得越好。</p><p> Specialty channels also made it easier to target specific audiences, which helped increase TV’s ad revenues. Meanwhile, HBO used cable distribution to skip advertising altogether, which allowed it to distribute feature films without censors or edits, and, later, produce original series with levels of nudity and violence that no advertiser would have allowed. By 2010, HBO had become the single most profitable network in the U.S.</p><p>专业频道也使瞄准特定受众变得更容易，这有助于增加电视的广告收入。与此同时，HBO利用有线电视分销完全跳过了广告，这使得它可以在没有审查或编辑的情况下发行故事片，然后制作具有任何广告商都不会允许的裸露和暴力水平的原创系列剧。到2010年，HBO已经成为美国最赚钱的单一电视网。</p><p> Of course, cable technology also introduced new constraints. The high cost of installing and operating cable meant it was now necessary  for consumers to pay for television. Since television networks didn’t have the skills or capital to lay down cable themselves, they had to be dis-intermediated by dedicated cable companies that bought the right to distribute these networks and charge the consumer for access.</p><p>当然，有线电视技术也引入了新的制约因素。安装和运营有线电视的高昂成本意味着现在消费者必须为电视付费。由于电视网络本身没有铺设有线电视的技能或资金，它们不得不由专门的有线电视公司来分流，这些有线电视公司购买了这些网络的分发权，并向消费者收取接入费用。</p><p> The difficulty and cost of laying cable had other impacts. Most households didn’t want their lawns dug up for two different cable companies, nor two different cable boxes set to different TV inputs. Accordingly, every home received video from only one provider. In addition, infrastructure costs were so high that many markets had only one provider in the first place – it rarely made sense for a second entrant to duplicate a first entrant’s footprint. This meant TV service was uncompetitive and prices were high — though it also meant consumers didn’t face exclusives. If we could have picked between Comcast or Time Warner Cable or Charter or BrightHouse or Verizon, you can bet the channels would have been different. “Showtime, now a Verizon exclusive network.”</p><p>铺设电缆的难度和成本也有其他影响。大多数家庭不希望为两家不同的有线电视公司挖草坪，也不希望两个不同的电缆箱设置为不同的电视输入。因此，每个家庭只从一个提供商那里收到视频。此外，基础设施成本如此之高，以至于许多市场一开始只有一个供应商-第二个进入者复制第一个进入者的足迹几乎没有意义。这意味着电视服务没有竞争力，价格也很高-尽管这也意味着消费者不会面临排他性问题。如果我们可以在康卡斯特、时代华纳有线电视、Charge、BrightHouse或Verizon之间做出选择，你可以打赌，这些频道会有所不同。“Showtime，现在是Verizon独家网络。”</p><p> Early cable technology also meant that households couldn’t access select channels or technically receive them on a selective basis (hence packages being “first 50”, then “all”). This eventually led to an overstuffed bundle that forced channels on households. This also meant that all the major media companies were sold together and shared customers – they competed for time, but not access nor individual customers.</p><p>早期的有线电视技术也意味着家庭不能访问选定的频道，或者从技术上说不能选择性地接收它们(因此套餐是“前50个”，然后是“所有”)。这最终导致了一个人满为患的捆绑包，迫使家庭收看频道。这也意味着，所有的主要媒体公司都被一起出售，共享客户-他们争夺时间，但不是访问权限，也不是单个客户。</p><p> The advent of digital video opened up the technology/business model/content loop yet again. Today, a network can reach consumers without dedicated infrastructure (i.e. the multi-purpose internet versus TV-specific coaxial cable), and so they sell directly and individually. This means exclusives are frequent, content fragmentation is high, and some networks (e.g. Netflix) have many times the customers as another (e.g. Epix).</p><p>数字视频的出现再次打开了技术/商业模式/内容循环。如今，无需专用基础设施(即多用途互联网与电视专用同轴电缆)，网络就可以到达消费者手中，因此消费者可以直接和单独销售。这意味着独家新闻经常出现，内容碎片化程度很高，一些电视网(如Netflix)拥有的客户是另一家电视网(如Epix)的数倍。</p><p> OTT video has also transformed content. As content has shifted online, serialized long-form storytelling has become dominant. Rich, plot driven series like Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones aren’t viable if the audience can’t catch most (if not all) original airings exactly when they start. Without the ability to catch up on a show mid-run, these series would never be able to attract new viewers and would decline in reach with every episode forever. The removal of commercials, meanwhile, meant that series no longer needed to be structured around ad breaks that occur every four to six minutes, or plotted so that scene would be exciting and/or funny enough to get a viewer to come back after a commercial. Similarly, a show could be any length.</p><p>奥特视频也改变了内容。随着内容转移到网上，连载的长篇故事讲述变得占主导地位。丰富的情节驱动的电视剧，如“绝命毒师”和“权力的游戏”，如果观众不能准确地在开播时观看大部分(如果不是全部)原创电视剧，那就不可行。如果没有中途追赶节目的能力，这些电视剧就永远不会吸引新的观众，而且每集的收视率都会永远下降。与此同时，商业广告的删除意味着这部电视剧不再需要围绕每四到六分钟发生一次的广告插曲来构建，或者情节安排得足够激动人心和/或有趣，足以让观众在广告结束后回来。同样，一场演出可以是任何长度。</p><p> Not all changes have been good. Some have argued the shift to serialized storytelling has also led to overlong, bloated series. The fact that every comedy had only 22 minutes meant good jokes were left on the cutting room floor, but so too were bad jokes and narrative fat. And just as it was hard to keep a viewer watching when every episode was filled with ads and aired 167 hours apart, it has arguably become too easy to keep a viewer watching when all they need to do is sit on their couch and wait for ad-free autoplays. Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos has effectively admitted that streaming allows less compelling shows to survive, saying he was a big fan of  Succession on </p><p>并不是所有的变化都是好的。一些人认为，向连续化故事讲述的转变也导致了过长、臃肿的连续剧。事实上，每部喜剧只有22分钟，这意味着好的笑话会留在剪辑室的地板上，但糟糕的笑话和叙事脂肪也会留在剪辑室里。就像当每一集都充斥着广告，播出间隔167小时时，让观众继续观看一样，让观众继续观看可以说是太容易了，而他们只需要坐在沙发上等待没有广告的自动播放就可以了。Netflix联合首席执行官泰德·萨兰多斯(Ted Sarandos)实际上承认，流媒体让不那么有说服力的节目得以生存，他说他是。</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/audiotech">https://www.matthewball.vc/all/audiotech</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/音频/">#音频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/audio/">#audio</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
