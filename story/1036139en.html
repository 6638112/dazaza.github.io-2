Detective gameplay (or &#34;investigation gameplay&#34;) poses a number of unique challenges centered around two main problems: the  struggle between story and puzzles (or &#34;cases&#34;) as well as  communication between the player and the game.</p><p>游戏设计学科领域如此广泛，多年来，该领域的职位名称变得越来越细密-自从我们开始制作首张游戏名称Lacuna以来，我越来越相信“侦探游戏设计师”的优点也有自己的面额侦探性游戏（或“调查游戏”）提出了许多独特的挑战，围绕两个主要问题：故事与谜题（或“案例”）之间的斗争以及玩家与游戏之间的沟通。</p><p> Since some of the explanations will be using our own game as an example, let me give you a quick rundown: Lacuna is a story-driven adventure with platformer controls and investigation elements. Its four fundamental gameplay types are dialogs (with choices), moving around, examining objects, and solving puzzles. All of them are staples of the point &amp; click genre, but their execution is quite unique; I don&#39;t want to go into more detail here because it&#39;s not pertinent to the topic, but you can  check out the game on Steam if you want to know more.</p><p> 由于某些解释将以我们自己的游戏为例，所以让我快速介绍一下：Lacuna是一个故事驱动的冒险，带有平台控制和调查元素。它的四种基本游戏类型是对话框（带有选择），四处移动，检查对象和解决难题。它们都是指向和点击类型的主要内容，但是它们的执行是非常独特的。我不想在这里进行详细介绍，因为它与主题无关，但是如果您想了解更多信息，可以在Steam上查看游戏。</p><p>   A handful of abstract game design principles lie at Lacuna&#39;s core. For instance, &#34;no takebacks&#34; dictates that the player only get one shot at every decision, dialog, and puzzle. The game auto-saves and doesn&#39;t allow you to go back if you performed poorly or regret an earlier decision. There&#39;s also &#34;limited feedback&#34;, which means that the player often isn&#39;t told immediately whether a solution was correct and what the consequences of their actions and decisions will be.</p><p>   少数抽象游戏设计原则是Lacuna的核心。例如，“没有收回”指示玩家在每个决策，对话和困惑中仅获得一杆。游戏会自动保存，并且如果您的表现不佳或对先前的决定感到后悔，则不允许您返回。还有“有限的反馈”，这意味着经常不会立即告诉玩家解决方案是否正确以及他们的行动和决定将带来什么后果。</p><p> However, there&#39;s one in particular I want to highlight here because it concerns the above mentioned divide between story and puzzling in detective games:  No getting stuck.</p><p> 但是，我要特别强调的是一个，因为它涉及侦探游戏中故事与困惑之间的上述区别：不会卡住。</p><p> The thought process behind it was simple: In games with both a story and puzzles (e.g. most P&amp;C games), story progress is almost always tied directly to puzzle progress. Until you solve the puzzle at hand, you don&#39;t get to see the next part of the story. For some players, especially those most interested in the story, this can become a problem. If they&#39;re stuck for too long, there&#39;s a chance they&#39;ll just drop out and never pick the game up again. Even if that doesn&#39;t happen, hard puzzles always run the risk of messing up the story&#39;s pacing and interrupting your immersion in the game – because you&#39;re becoming frustrated or, even worse, because you decide to tab out and Google the solution. To avoid people getting stuck, we considered a number of solutions:</p><p> 它背后的思考过程很简单：在同时具有故事和谜题的游戏（例如大多数P＆C游戏）中，故事进度几乎总是与谜题进度直接相关。除非您解决手头的难题，否则您将看不到故事的下一部分。对于某些玩家，尤其是对故事最感兴趣的玩家，这可能会成为问题。如果他们被困的时间太久了，他们很有可能会退出比赛，再也不会继续比赛了。即使这种情况没有发生，难题也总是冒着搞乱故事节奏并中断您沉浸在游戏中的风险–因为您感到沮丧，甚至更糟糕的是，因为您决定退出并使用Google解决方案。为了避免人们陷入困境，我们考虑了多种解决方案：</p><p> Solution 1: Make the puzzles very easy? This isn&#39;t our favorite since it somewhat defeats the purpose of puzzles. They&#39;d still play a role as a change of pace now and then, but if puzzles aren&#39;t a little hard, nobody will feel like a detective solving them. Some early puzzles in Lacuna are easy, but most aren&#39;t.</p><p> 解决方案1：使难题变得非常容易吗？这不是我们的最爱，因为它在一定程度上破坏了拼图的目的。它们仍然会时不时地在改变节奏中发挥作用，但是如果难题不难解决，没人会觉得像侦探一样解决难题。拉库纳（Lacuna）的一些早期难题很容易，但大多数难题并非如此。</p><p> Solution 2: Provide hints? Hint systems can be found in many adventures featuring puzzles. Unfortunately, they often take the player out of the experience in one of three ways: In some cases, the hint is provided by extradiegetic UI (e.g. in the pause menu) and therefore seems to come out of nowhere in the game world. In other cases, the player character is the one giving the hint, disconnecting the player from their avatar’s perspective. The third option of NPCs providing hints is a little better; however, it is often hard to justify  why an NPC would be able to point the player in the right direction without possessing the rest of the solution to the ongoing puzzle (and why they didn&#39;t volunteer it in the first place). The two types of (sort-of) hint systems we went with in Lacuna are  Highlight Mode, which displays optional outlines around objects and NPCs that hold new information, and  redundant information, meaning that sometimes the player is given two ways of obtaining an important clue.</p><p> 解决方案2：提供提示吗？提示系统可以在许多带有拼图的冒险中找到。不幸的是，它们经常以三种方式之一使玩家脱离游戏体验：在某些情况下，提示是由外籍用户界面提供的（例如，在暂停菜单中），因此在游戏世界中似乎无处不在。在其他情况下，玩家角色是提供提示的角色，使玩家脱离了虚拟角色的视线。 NPC提供提示的第三个选项要好一些。但是，通常很难证明为什么NPC可以在没有掌握正在进行的难题的其余解决方案的情况下将玩家指向正确的方向（以及为什么他们一开始没有自愿提供解决方案）。我们在Lacuna中使用的两种（分类）提示系统是“突出显示模式”，该模式在对象和包含新信息的NPC周围显示可选的轮廓，并显示冗余信息，这意味着有时会为玩家提供两种获取重要信息的方法线索。</p><p>  Solution 3: Decouple story progress from puzzle progress? Why not simply make a story-driven game throughout which the player can solve the occasional puzzle if they feel like it? Well, because it would require that puzzles be somewhat detached from the story. As a result, they run the risk of feeling meaningless since solving them is not rewarding and failing is not punishing. However, this  can work quite well when combined with...</p><p>解决方案3：将故事进度与拼图进度脱钩吗？为什么不简单地制作一个故事驱动的游戏，让玩家在感觉满意的情况下可以解决偶尔出现的困惑呢？好吧，因为这将需要使谜题与故事脱节。结果，他们冒着感到毫​​无意义的风险，因为解决他们并没有回报，失败也没有惩罚。但是，如果与...结合使用，效果会很好。</p><p> Solution 4: Make branching content for different solutions? Instead of impeding the player’s progress, wrong or missing puzzle solutions could lead to a less desirable continuation and/or outcome of the story. Unfortunately, creating a new story branch for each and every wrong solution to a puzzle is hardly feasible. However, there are less extreme ways of realizing this. For instance, the game could account for the player’s  overall puzzling performance at certain points in the game, e.g. trigger the “good” finale to an act if they got more than x% of the puzzles right, and the “bad” one if not. There could also be cascading consequences of sorts, e.g. solving one case correctly may give the player an edge in a later one. These approaches have similar downsides as optional puzzles do, but to a lesser degree; puzzle success no longer being required for progress makes them feel more detached from the story and removes immediate feedback. Regardless, we have found this to be the best solution, which is why we employ it quite a bit in Lacuna (while trying to avoid all the pitfalls). By the way, if all of this is becoming too abstract for you, bear with us! The second half of this post is all about a real example from the game.</p><p> 解决方案4：为不同的解决方案创建分支内容？错误或丢失的难题解决方案可能会导致故事的延续性和/或结果不太理想，而不是阻碍玩家的前进，不幸的是，为难题的每个错误解决方案创建新的故事分支几乎是不可行的。但是，很少有极端的方法可以实现此目的。例如，游戏可以说明玩家在游戏中某些特定时刻（例如，如果难题的正确率超过x％，则触发“好”结局；否则，则触发“坏”结局。可能还会有各种级联的后果，例如正确解决一种情况可能会使玩家在后一种情况中占优势。这些方法具有与可选难题相似的缺点，但程度较小。成功不再需要拼图成功，这使他们感到与故事更加分离，并消除了即时反馈。无论如何，我们发现这是最好的解决方案，这就是为什么我们在Lacuna中大量使用它（同时努力避免所有陷阱）的原因。顺便说一句，如果所有这些对您来说都变得太抽象了，请耐心等待！这篇文章的后半部分全部来自游戏中的真实示例。</p><p> Detroit: Become Human offers an astonishing number of different outcomes depending on player action, but not everybody has that kind of money to burn</p><p> 底特律：《变人》根据玩家的动作提供了惊人的数量不同的结果，但并不是每个人都有那么多钱要花</p><p> Despite all of these measures being taken to make sure that the player won&#39;t get stuck, Lacuna can still be called a hard game. While it&#39;s not difficult to get  to the end, it&#39;s pretty difficult to get a  good ending and not mess things up on your way there. In other words, rushing through the whole story is possible if you don&#39;t mind bringing it to a terrible conclusion.</p><p> 尽管采取了所有这些措施来确保玩家不会卡住，但Lacuna仍然可以称为困难游戏。虽然到达终点并不难，但要取得良好的结局并且不弄乱那里的状况相当困难。换句话说，如果您不介意得出一个可怕的结论，就有可能纵览整个故事。</p><p>  While the previous chapter only concerns detective games that also prominently feature a story, this next one is relevant to pretty much every detective game every made. It addresses the topic of communication between the player and the game, and especially how the player can express their thoughts to it. Several principles have proven to make for a good experience across countless approaches to this problem over the years:</p><p>  上一章只涉及故事中也很突出的侦探游戏，而下一章则几乎涉及每一个制作的侦探游戏。它解决了玩家与游戏之间的交流话题，尤其是玩家如何表达对游戏的想法。多年来，已经证明了多种原则，可以为无数方法解决此问题提供良好的经验：</p><p> Principle 1: Many channels out, few channels back in. If the game conveys information to the player on many different channels and in many different ways, the process of piecing the solution together tends to feel more interesting and rewarding. In Lacuna, the player picks up clues from dialogs, objects, environments, the news, and e-mails (with all sorts of attachments). At the same time, the channels via which the player communicates that solution back to the game are kept to a minimum, namely cloze texts we like to call &#34;Case Sheets&#34; and (to a lesser degree) dialog choices. Having one or two central mechanics for player input makes the experience more coherent and transparent and facilitates designing the mysteries around it.</p><p> 原则1：有许多渠道可供使用，有少量渠道可以退回。如果游戏通过许多不同的渠道以多种不同的方式向玩家传达信息，则将解决方案拼凑在一起的过程往往会变得更加有趣和有意义。在Lacuna中，播放器从对话框，对象，环境，新闻和电子邮件（带有各种附件）中获取线索。同时，玩家将解决方案传达给游戏的渠道保持在最低限度，即我们称为“案例表”的结束语和（在较小程度上）对话选择。拥有一两个中央机制供玩家输入，使体验更加连贯和透明，并有助于设计围绕其的奥秘。</p><p> Return of the Obra Dinn by Lucas Pope provides a bunch of different sources of information, but just one central mechanic for the player to communicate back to the game</p><p> 卢卡斯·波普（Lucas Pope）创作的《奥布拉·狄恩（Obra Dinn）》的回归提供了许多不同的信息来源，但只是一个中心机制，使玩家可以与游戏交流</p><p> Principle 2: Have the player communicate only the solution. It is near impossible to create a system through which the player communicates to the game  how they arrived at a solution. Luckily, this is not necessary. A well-designed puzzle provides all the information, then moves the entire solution process solely  into the player’s head, and finally prompts the player to input only their answer. The player’s objective should be stated clearly, but in a very general way at the start of a case (e.g. “find the culprit”).</p><p>原则2：让播放器仅传达解决方案。几乎不可能创建一个系统，玩家可以通过该系统与游戏交流他们如何得出解决方案。幸运的是，这不是必需的。经过精心设计的拼图可以提供所有信息，然后将整个解决方案流程仅移到玩家的脑海中，最后提示玩家仅输入他们的答案。应该清楚地说明玩家的目标，但在案件开始时要以非常笼统的方式陈述（例如“找到罪魁祸首”）。</p><p> Principle 3: Give the player maximum freedom in communicating the solution. The way in which the player communicates the answer to the game is the most crucial part to get right. One aspect is to give the player many choices (or a large combination of choices) to pick from. Two things should be avoided: 1. Giving the player a high probability to succeed by picking a random answer. 2. Making it easy for the player to guess correctly because only one or a few of the available answers appear plausible. An example for a bad solution like this would be to give the player three dialog choices to solve the puzzle; even worse would be if one of them obviously made the most sense. A better approach would be to give the player a cloze text with a bunch of plausible options for each gap. Another possibility is to have the solution be an unguessable string of characters that the player needs to enter manually. Both ideas utilize combinatorial explosion to make guessing and brute-forcing nearly impossible.</p><p> 原则3：在解决方案交流中给予玩家最大的自由度。玩家传达游戏答案的方式是最正确的部分。一方面是给玩家许多选择（或选择的大组合）。应避免两件事：1.通过随机选择答案，给予玩家很高的成功可能性。 2.因为只有一个或几个可用的答案似乎是合理的，所以使玩家易于正确猜测。此类不良解决方案的一个示例是为玩家提供三个对话框选项来解决难题；更糟糕的是，如果其中之一显然最有意义。更好的方法是为玩家提供一个结束语，每个空格都有许多合理的选择。另一种可能性是使解决方案成为玩家需要手动输入的无法猜测的字符串。两种想法都利用组合爆炸来使猜测和暴力破解几乎变得不可能。</p><p>   Hopefullly all this will become crystal clear when put to concrete use! The following is an early level in Lacuna. It doesn&#39;t contain some of the difficulties added later (like a large number of channels communicating potential evidence). In harder cases, the player will need to have paid attention to testimonies, news articles etc. from earlier levels to arrive at the correct conclusion, and some cases span multiple levels. Not this one, though; all the information required to solve it is directly contained in the clues and dialogs of the one level where it starts and ends.</p><p>   希望所有这些在具体使用时都将变得清晰起来！以下是拉古纳的早期课程。它不包含后来添加的一些困难（例如，大量渠道交流潜在证据）。在较困难的情况下，玩家将需要从较早的级别开始关注证词，新闻报道等，以得出正确的结论，并且某些情况下跨多个级别。不过，不是这个。解决该问题所需的所有信息都直接包含在其开始和结束的一级提示和对话框中。</p><p> This chapter won&#39;t reveal much of importance about the story, but it will spoil the solution to this one puzzle, so consider yourself warned.</p><p> 本章不会透露有关该故事的重要性，但是会破坏这一难题的解决方案，因此请考虑一下自己。</p><p>  Here&#39;s what happens: Our protagonist Neil is called to a crime scene to investigate a murder. His colleague Gary explains that a sniper must&#39;ve taken the fatal shot from one of the opposite highrisers. He mentions that one of them, the casino, is holding a large event with lots of security, so it probably wouldn&#39;t have been the sniper&#39;s first choice. Neil is also told that the bullet hasn&#39;t been found yet.</p><p>  这是发生的情况：我们的主角尼尔被召到犯罪现场调查谋杀案。他的同事加里（Gary）解释说，狙击手一定是从对面的一个高高手之一的致命一枪。他提到其中一个人，即赌场，正在举行一项大型活动，具有很高的安全性，因此这可能不是狙击手的首选。尼尔还被告知尚未找到子弹。</p><p> At this point, the player is given the Case Sheet, allowing them to submit their solution at any time from now on. This way, the player cannot know when exactly they possess enough information to solve it correctly. It also allows them to just submit any random solution if they completely get stuck and want to get on with the story. The Case Sheet simply reads &#34;The shot was fired from ____&#34;, which doesn&#39;t spoil the solution while also formulating the question very clearly. There are only four options to pick from, which does make the answer more guessable, but we decided that was acceptable for the first puzzle, especially given that the player has only one shot.</p><p> 此时，将为玩家提供案例表，允许他们从现在开始随时提交解决方案。这样，玩家就无法知道他们何时确切拥有足够的信息来正确解决它。如果他们完全陷入困境并想继续讲故事，它还使他们可以提交任何随机的解决方案。案例表仅显示“镜头是从____开枪的”，这不会破坏解决方案，同时也非常清楚地提出了问题。只有四个选项可供选择，这确实使答案更容易猜测，但是我们认为第一个难题是可以接受的，特别是考虑到玩家只有一次射击。</p><p>  The player can now walk around the building freely, investigate objects and talk to witnesses. Some of what they learn may be fluff, world-building, or even red herrings, but some is important evidence. The body lies out on the balcony, from where four buildings are visible: Gadle Hotel, Pixie Casino, Sakura Hotel, and Rocket Tower (from left to right). By investigating them, the player learns their approximate distance to the balcony. The position of the body, head to the left, already indicates that the shot probably came from somewhere on the right. A witness inside who saw the body hit the ground corroborates this.</p><p>  玩家现在可以在建筑物周围自由走动，研究物体并与目击者交谈。他们学到的一些东西可能是绒毛，造世界或什至是红鲱鱼，但是有些是重要的证据。尸体躺在阳台上，从那里可以看到四座建筑：Gadle Hotel，Pixie Casino，Sakura Hotel和Rocket Tower（从左到右）。通过调查，玩家可以了解到阳台的大致距离。身体的位置（从左到右）已经表明该镜头可能来自右侧的某个位置。内部目击者的尸体证实了这一点。</p><p> The player may notice that they can also investigate a cupboard next to the balcony door. Its description states that the bullet disappeared into the wall on the other side and that it is locked. Investigating it unlocks a new dialog with a witness who gives the player the keys. They open up the cupboard and find the bullet. Neil&#39;s colleague takes a look at it and surmises that it came from a rather small and quiet rifle that cannot shoot accurately over distances greater than 200 meters.</p><p>玩家可能会注意到，他们还可以研究阳台门旁边的橱柜。它的描述指出，子弹消失在另一侧的墙上，并且已被锁定。研究它会打开一个新的对话框，其中包含为玩家提供钥匙的见证人。他们打开橱柜，找到子弹。尼尔的同事看了一眼，推测它来自一支很小而安静的步枪，无法在200米以上的距离内准确射击。</p><p>  Gadle Hotel probably appears unlikely at this point because it&#39;s too far on the left. The casino is also on the left and would additionally be a bad pick due to its increased security that night. This leaves Sakura Hotel and Rocket Tower, only the former of which is close enough to be plausible. (Remember that the player learned both the rifle&#39;s effective range and each of the buildings&#39; distances to the balcony earlier.) At this point, the player may decide they&#39;ve seen enough and submit the Case Sheet.</p><p>  目前，Gadle Hotel似乎不太可能出现，因为它离左侧太远了。赌场也位于左侧，由于当晚安全性增强，它还将是一个坏选择。这留下了樱花酒店和火箭塔，只有前者足够近，才有可能成为现实。 （请记住，玩家早些时候就知道了步枪的有效射程和每座建筑物到阳台的距离。）此时，玩家可以决定他们已经看够了并提交案例表。</p><p>  Now the game evaluates if the player got the answer right. If so, that&#39;s perfect: The player&#39;s correct answer causes the story to continue, and they head off to Sakura Hotel to look for the sniper. But how do we handle it if they picked one of the other three buildings?</p><p>  现在，游戏会评估玩家是否获得正确答案。如果是这样，那就太完美了：玩家的正确答案会导致故事继续，然后他们前往Sakura Hotel寻找狙击手。但是，如果他们选择了其他三座建筑之一，我们将如何处理呢？</p><p> You might be thinking that we could prevent the Case Sheet from being accepted until it&#39;s correct. Although not unheard of, that&#39;s a bad idea because:</p><p> 您可能会认为我们可以阻止案例表在正确之前被接受。尽管不是闻所未闻，但这是一个坏主意，因为：</p><p> It allows brute-forcing. And if it didn&#39;t (by introducing combinatorial explosion), it would allow getting stuck.</p><p> 它允许暴力破解。如果不这样做（通过引入组合爆炸），它将被卡住。</p><p> It doesn&#39;t make sense that the Case Sheet or the person reviewing it knows the right answer and is withholding it.</p><p> 案例表或审阅该表的人知道正确的答案并保留该答案是没有意义的。</p><p> Then how about we trigger a game over state if the submission was wrong? Having to replay the level would at least discourage brute-forcing. The thing is:</p><p> 如果提交错误，我们如何触发游戏结束状态？必须重播该级别至少会阻止暴力破解。事情是：</p><p> We&#39;re trying to avoid game over states since they break the immersion (in any game).</p><p>我们试图避免游戏过度状态，因为它们会破坏沉浸感（在任何游戏中）。</p><p> It&#39;s frustrating chicanery; remember that we want people to be able to get on with the story whenever they want.</p><p> 令人沮丧的嘲弄；请记住，我们希望人们能够在他们想要的时候继续讲故事。</p><p> It contradicts another design principle of ours: no takebacks. You submitted the wrong answer, you should have to live with it.</p><p> 它与我们的另一个设计原则相抵触：不得收回。您提交了错误的答案，您应该接受它。</p><p> Okay, next idea. We could make all the incorrect buildings levels of their own and have the player go there to eventually realize they&#39;re in a dead end... But we shouldn&#39;t, for a number of reasons:</p><p> 好的，下一个想法。我们可以自己设定所有错误的建筑物级别，然后让玩家去那里，最终意识到它们陷入了死胡同……但出于多种原因，我们不应该这样做：</p><p> The player may take a long time to realize they&#39;re in the wrong place and will then have to be steered in the right direction anyway.</p><p> 玩家可能需要很长时间才能意识到自己在错误的位置，因此无论如何都必须朝着正确的方向操纵。</p><p> It can&#39;t possibly be applied to later cases, where Case Sheets allow for 256 (4x4x4x4) or even more possible answers.</p><p> 它不可能应用于以后的案例，案例表允许256（4x4x4x4）甚至更多可能的答案。</p><p> As is the nature of game design, what we did end up doing is the  least bad solution with the most acceptable drawbacks. Here&#39;s what happens: If the player picked the wrong building, everything seems fine until they get into a train to their destination. They then get a call about an anonymous tip made by someone at Sakura Hotel and are told to go there instead. This tip (and especially the reason for it being anonymous) is itself a piece of evidence for the puzzle at the hotel, already setting up the next mystery. This hopefully somewhat turns the attention away from the fact that the player just got railroaded back to the correct path. The player is also told that someone else from their squad will follow up on the building they (incorrectly) selected, and they will later learn that it turned out to be a dead end. Plus, Gary will make a snarky comment about the player&#39;s misstep in the next level. These are some small ways to make the player feel like their decision wasn&#39;t completely irrelevant.</p><p> 正如游戏设计的本质一样，我们最终要做的是提供最可接受的缺点的最差的解决方案。发生的事情是：如果玩家选择了错误的建筑物，一切似乎都很好，直到他们乘火车到达目的地为止。然后，他们接到一个电话，询问某人在Sakura Hotel的匿名举报，并被告知去那里。这个提示（尤其是匿名的原因）本身就是在酒店中解开谜题的证据，已经引起了下一个谜团。希望这可以将注意力从玩家刚刚回到正确的道路这一事实转移开。玩家还被告知，班上的其他人将继续（错误地）选择他们所选择的建筑物，随后他们将得知这是死胡同。另外，加里（Gary）将在下一关中对玩家的失误发表尖刻的评论。这些是使玩家感到自己的决定并非完全无关紧要的一些小方法。</p><p> And in fact, it wasn&#39;t: Here&#39;s where cascading consequences come in.  Each and every correct puzzle solution throughout the first act may produce a piece of evidence relevant to the act&#39;s overarching case. This means that every incorrectly solved case makes it more likely (or even inevitable) that the player will fail the bigger ongoing case. Failing the first act&#39;s overarching case will in turn lead to information not being obtainable in the second act, which in turn prevents the player from getting one of the two &#34;best&#34; endings to the game. This cascading system makes sure that even small failures can have big consequences even though the player is immediately railroaded into the correct path at the time of their misstep.</p><p>实际上，事实并非如此：这是连锁反应的结果。在第一幕中，每个正确的难题解决方案都可能产生与该案总体情况有关的证据。这意味着，每一个错误解决的案例都会使玩家更有可能（甚至不可避免）使更大的正在进行的案例失败。如果第一行为举足轻重，则会导致在第二行为中无法获取信息，从而阻止玩家获得游戏的两个“最佳”结局之一。这种级联系统可确保即使玩家在失误时立即立即驶入正确的道路，即使是很小的失误也可能造成重大后果。</p><p> Of course, this wouldn&#39;t be game design we&#39;re talking about if these cascading consequences didn&#39;t come with their own set of problems. Most notably, the player may find it unfair or, even worse, not realize at all that they  cannot know the solution to a later puzzle due to having failed an earlier one. But although we have come up with some solutions for this problem as well, let&#39;s not go down that rabbit hole today.</p><p> 当然，这不是我们要谈论的游戏设计，如果这些连锁反应不是由他们自己的问题引起的。最值得注意的是，玩家可能会发现它不公平，甚至更糟糕的是，根本没有意识到由于早先的失败而无法解决后一个难题的解决方案。但是，尽管我们也针对此问题提出了一些解决方案，但今天我们不要陷入困境。</p><p> Have a look at this censored overview of just the second act: bubbles are scenes, and the thinner lines between them represent only the most important (cascading) consequences</p><p> 看一下第二幕的审查情况：气泡是场景，它们之间的细线仅表示最重要的（级联）结果</p><p>  Let&#39;s quickly go over all the solutions and principles mentioned in the first half and see if we managed to apply them to our case.</p><p>  让我们快速回顾上半部分提到的所有解决方案和原则，看看我们是否设法将其应用于我们的案例。</p><p>  No takebacks? Check. The player has one shot at submitting the Case Sheet and will have to live with the consequences.  Limited feedback? Check. The player isn&#39;t told (right away) if their answer was right or wrong, even though they&#39;re always sent to the right building. What about  no getting stuck, did we apply any of the provided solutions?  Did we make the puzzle easy? Yes, but only because it&#39;s an early one.  Did we decouple story and puzzle progress? Yes, the player can always submit their Case Sheet, which ends the level and starts the next one.  Did we make branching content for different solutions? Yes, in two ways: small changes in dialogs and, more importantly, our system of cascasing consequences.  Did we provide hints? Sort of. We did use Highlight Mode (which highlights new information sources) and redundant clues (i.e. multiple ways to obtain the same information, e.g. the direction the victim fell when shot).</p><p>  没有回扣吗？检查一下玩家提交案例表时一枪，必须承担后果。反馈有限？检查一下即使总是将他们发送到正确的建筑物，也不会（立即）告知玩家他们的答案是对还是错。不会卡住，我们是否应用了提供的任何解决方案？我们使难题变得容易了吗？是的，但这只是因为它是早期的。我们是否使故事与进步解脱了？是的，玩家可以随时提交他们的案例表，该案例表结束该级别并开始下一个案例。我们是否为不同的解决方案制作了分支内容？是的，有两种方式：对话中的小改动，更重要的是，我们的诉讼后果体系。我们提供了提示吗？有点。我们确实使用了突出显示模式（突出显示新的信息来源）和多余的线索（即获得相同信息的多种方式，例如受害者在被枪击时跌倒的方向）。</p><p> The player toggles highlights on and off; blue (objects) and orange (NPCs) indicate new information</p><p> 播放器打开和关闭高光；蓝色（对象）和橙色（NPC）表示新信息</p><p>   Did the game communicate on  many channels? Not particularly since this is an early, easy case. The player only has investigatable clues and witness testimonies to work with. Did the player communicate  back on few channels? Yes, the solution to the case is submitted via one central mechanic, a Case Sheet. Did the player communicate  only the solution? Yes, the Case Sheet does not ask how they arrived at the conclusion. Did the player have big  freedom communicating the solution? Not really, but we found it acceptable here as there&#39;s still only a 25% chance of guessing it. A high number of solutions is much more crucial for games that allow infinite retries and thus lend themselves to brute-forcing instead of giving the player just a single shot like Lacuna does.</p><p>   游戏是否通过许多渠道进行交流？由于这是一个早期的简单案例，因此并不特别。玩家只有可调查的线索和见证才能使用。播放器是否在少数几个频道上进行了交流？是的，案件的解决方案是通过一个中心机制（案件表）提交的。播放器仅传达解决方案吗？是的，案例表不询问他们如何得出结论。玩家有很大的自由来传达解决方案吗？不是真的，但是我们发现这里可以接受，因为猜测的机会仍然只有25％。对于允许无限次重试并因此使自己陷入暴力而不是像Lacuna那样给玩家一枪的游戏，大量解决方案至关重要。</p><p>  Detective gameplay is hard to get right. We&#39;re lucky to be building upon so many experiments by countless other game developers teaching us what works (and what doesn&#39;t), and it&#39;s our hope that we&#39;ve mixed an interesting and unique cocktail of ideas that will keep you engaged and entertained throughout our game. If you want to see for yourself,  wishlist Lacuna now and give it a spin when it comes out.</p><p>侦探性游戏很难做到。我们很幸运能在无数其他游戏开发商的大量实验基础上，教给我们什么有效（什么无效），我们希望我们融合了有趣而独特的想法，这些想法将使您不断参与并在我们的整个游戏中都很有趣。如果您想亲自看看，请立即列出Lacuna，并在产品上市后试一试。</p><p> If you have any thoughts on the topic or resources to share, let us know!
