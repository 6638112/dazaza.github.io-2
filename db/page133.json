would go. Over the next 5 months, I ended up releasing 16 libraries and learned a lot along the way. I wanted to share some of that knowledge and introduce some of the libraries you can now use in Ruby.\n  There are many great machine libraries for Python, so a natural place to start was to see what it\u2019d take to bring them to Ruby. It turned out to be a lot less work than expected based on a common theme.\n ML libraries want to be fast. This means less time waiting and more time iterating. However, interpreted languages like Python and Ruby aren\u2019t relatively fast. How do libraries overcome this?\n The key is they do most of the work in a compiled language - typically C++ - and have wrappers for other languages like Python.\n This was really great news. The same approach and code could be used for Ruby.\n   Native extensions are one method. They\u2019re written in C or C++ and use  Ruby\u2019s C API. You may have noticed gems with native extensions taking longer to install, as they need to compile.\n  A more general way for one language to call another is a foreign function interface, or FFI. It requires a C API (due to C++ name mangling), which many machine learning libraries had. An advantage of FFI is you can define the interface in the host language - in our case, Ruby.\n Ruby supports FFI with Fiddle. It was added in Ruby 1.9, but appears to be  \u201cthe Ruby standard library\u2019s best kept secret.\u201d\n  There\u2019s also the  FFI gem, which provides higher-level functionality and overcomes some limitations of Fiddle (like the ability to pass structs by value).\n  For libraries without a C API,  Rice provides a really nice way to bind C++ code (similar to Python\u2019s pybind11).\n  Another approach is SWIG (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator). You create an interface file and then run SWIG to generate the bindings. Gusto has a  good tutorial on this.\n  There\u2019s also  Rubex, which lets you write Ruby-like code that compiles to C (similar to Python\u2019s Cython). It also provides the ability to interface with C libraries.\n  None of the approaches above are specific to machine learning, so you can use them with any C or C++ library.\n  Libraries were chosen based on popularity and performance. Many have a similar interface to their Python counterpart to make it easy to follow existing tutorials. Libraries are broken down into categories below with brief descriptions.\n  XGBoost and  LightGBM are gradient boosting libraries. Gradient boosting is a powerful technique for building predictive models that fits many small decision trees that together make robust predictions, even with outliers and missing values. Gradient boosting performs well on tabular data.\n  Torch.rb and  TensorFlow are deep learning libraries. Torch.rb is built on LibTorch, the library that powers PyTorch. Deep learning has been very successful in areas like image recognition and natural language processing.\n  Disco is a recommendation library. It looks at ratings or actions from users to predict other items they might like, known as collaborative filtering. Matrix factorization is a common way to accomplish this.\n  Collaborative filtering can also find similar users and items. If you have a large number of users or items, an approximate nearest neighbor algorithm can speed up the search. Spotify  does this for music recommendations.\n NGT is an approximate nearest neighbor library that performs extremely well on benchmarks (in Python/C++).\n   Another promising technique for recommendations is factorization machines. The traditional approach to collaborative filtering builds a model exclusively from past ratings or actions. However, you may have additional  side information about users or items. Factorization machines can incorporate this data. They can also perform classification and regression.\n   Optimization finds the best solution to a problem out of many possible solutions. Scheduling and vehicle routing are two common tasks. Optimization problems have an objective function to minimize (or maximize) and a set of constraints.\n Linear programming is an approach you can use when the objective function and constraints are linear. Here\u2019s a really good  introductory series if you want to learn more.\n    fastText is a text classification and word representation library. It can label documents with one or more categories, which is useful for content tagging, spam filtering, and language detection. It can also compute word vectors, which can be compared to find similar words and analogies.\n   ONNX Runtime is a scoring engine for ML models. You can build a model in one language, save it in the ONNX format, and run it in another. Here\u2019s  an example.\n Npy is a library for saving and loading NumPy  npy and  npz files. It uses  Numo for multi-dimensional arrays.\n  Vowpal Wabbit specializes in online learning. It\u2019s great for reinforcement learning as well as supervised learning where you want to train a model incrementally instead of all at once. This is nice when you have a lot of data.\n  GSLR is a linear regression library powered by GSL that supports both ordinary least squares and ridge regression. It can be used alone or to improve the performance of  Eps.\n  I wanted to also give a shout-out to another library that entered the scene in 2019.\n Rumale is a machine learning library that supports many, many algorithms, similar to Python\u2019s Scikit-learn. Thanks  @yoshoku for the amazing work!\n  There are now many state-of-the-art machine learning libraries available for Ruby. If you\u2019re a Ruby engineering who\u2019s interested in machine learning, now\u2019s a good time to try it. Also, if you come across a C or C++ library you want to use in Ruby, you\u2019ve seen a few ways to do it.

bodies to make vaccines that will\u00a0\u2013 hopefully\u00a0\u2013 prevent recurrences and treatments designed to fight off\u00a0advanced tumors.\n If they prove effective, which won&#39;t be known for at least another year or two, they could be added to the arsenal of immune therapies designed to get the body to fight off its own tumors.\n &#34;We feel pretty good about enrolling patients on these trials and are hopeful that ultimately they\u00a0can demonstrate improved outcomes,&#34; said Dr. Ryan Sullivan, a melanoma expert at\u00a0Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\n    Doctors are remaining cautious\u00a0because cancer vaccine\u00a0development &#34;has been littered with vaccines that haven&#39;t hit the mark,&#34; said Dr. Stephen Hahn, who had a career as an oncologist before running the Food and Drug Administration from 2019 until early this year.\n He said he&#39;s more optimistic this time because of how much researchers have learned about the role the immune system plays\u00a0in cancer.\n &#34;That gives us an edge to maybe finally get to the place where we need to be,&#34; said Hahn, who recently took a post with a venture capital firm, Flagship Pioneering. &#34;That would be just a remarkable step for all of us.&#34;\n  At the moment, most of the mRNA cancer vaccine trials are targeting\u00a0tumors such as melanoma and kidney cancer, where drugs called checkpoint inhibitors have already made a significant difference for many patients.\n &#34;My hope is that if we&#39;re successful, we&#39;ll be able to move into more tumor types where checkpoints haven&#39;t been as successful,&#34;\u00a0said Meredith McKean, Fentress&#39; oncologist at\u00a0Sarah Cannon Research Institute\u00a0in Nashville.\n  Fentress, of nearby Goodlettsville, Tennessee, thought he had a wart back in the summer of 2019 when he first noticed the odd bump on the middle finger of his left hand. He&#39;d had lots of those.\n At his wife Jennie&#39;s urging, he finally went to the dermatologist just before Thanksgiving. A few days later he got a call from the doctor. It wasn&#39;t just an ordinary wart, she told him, and he&#39;d need to come back to get a biopsy.\n  In early December, a surgeon amputated most of\u00a0his left middle finger. Fentress,\u00a0who is helping raise the two youngest of his five grandchildren, was told he had a 50% chance of recurrence. And if it did come back, his chances weren&#39;t good.\n  Over the last decade, pharmaceutical companies around the world have\u00a0been developing new ways to train the body&#39;s immune system to fight off tumors, particularly melanoma.\n  They had learned how to remove a brake installed by tumors, unleashing the warriors of the immune system. Ten years ago, only about 5% of people with advanced melanoma survived for five years. Now, nearly half\u00a0make it that long.\n  Trials of mRNA cancer vaccines, like the one\u00a0Fentress began in spring 2020, aim to boost that number even higher by adding soldiers to the fight.\n Cancer is challenging to treat because the body recognizes cancer cells as part of itself, and leaves them alone. Many of the targets of cancer therapy also are present in healthy cells, which is why cancer treatments are often so damaging.\n  Moderna, in a process similar to the other companies&#39;,\u00a0took cells from Fentress&#39; tumor. A computer analyzed the cells for tiny differences from normal cells that it could\u00a0use\u00a0as targets.\n Then the company\u00a0identified mutations that make protein variants only found on cancerous cells. They then create a single mRNA\u00a0that triggers the body to make these proteins\u00a0\u2013 just as COVID-19 vaccines trigger production of the spike protein that sits\u00a0on the surface of the virus. The presence of these protein fragments triggers the immune system to attack anything with that protein.\n  In April 2020, at Sarah Cannon, Fentress got his first shots of mRNA tailored to his tumor.\n &#34;They knocked me off my butt for about two days,&#34; he said. &#34;I&#39;ve never been as cold in my life.&#34;\n He also began\u00a0receiving a so-called checkpoint blockade drug to unleash his immune system against his cancer. The combination of lifting the brakes and adding soldiers to the fight\u00a0hopefully will keep his tumor from ever coming back.\n  It&#39;s too soon to know whether the therapy will work, but his doctor McKean, said he did well with the treatment.\n   Preventing recurrences is the &#34;ideal setting&#34; for mRNA technology,\u00a0said\u00a0Dr. \u00d6zlem T\u00fcreci, co-founder and chief medical officer of BioNTech.\n Once a tumor has been largely removed through surgery, a vaccine can help generate new immune soldiers known as T cells.\n &#34;The T cells will outnumber (cancer cells) and will be able to control them,&#34; T\u00fcreci said.\n Plus, a treatment soon after surgery may be able to prevent the tumor from outmaneuvering the body&#39;s immune defenses, she said.\n As with Fentress, surgical samples or a biopsy are sent to a lab where a patient&#39;s cancer cells are compared to healthy ones.\n A computer algorithm analyzes the mutations\u00a0distinct to the cancer cells, looking for ones that trigger the production of T cells, said Melissa J. Moore, Moderna&#39;s chief scientific officer, of platform research.\n So far, she said, Moderna, working with partner Merck,\u00a0has tested these personalized vaccines in about 100 patients.\n They aim eventually to make a personalized mRNA vaccine within about\u00a045\u00a0days after the patient&#39;s cancer surgery, during their\u00a0recovery.\n People who already have advanced cancer may not be able to wait for therapy. And while a few errant cancer cells are very diverse, once a tumor has spread throughout the body, it tends to develop consistent mutations, T\u00fcreci said.\n So the companies are also developing treatments that can be pre-made and &#39;taken off the shelf&#39; when a patient needs them.\n Mutated cancer cells have proteins on their surface that can be targeted by an mRNA vaccine.\u00a0For a tumor that has, say, five common mutations, a patient could get a combination of five of these vaccines.\n On Friday, BioNTech announced it was launching a new trial for this approach, testing it in 120 melanoma patients\u00a0Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia and the U.S. The new treatment, given in connection with an antibody from Regeneron, is aimed at four tumor-associated antigens. More than 90% of melanoma tumors contain at least one of the four.\n Researchers now have a better understanding of how to stimulate the immune system, said\u00a0Ulrike Gnad-Vogt, interim chief development officer for CureVac, a German mRNA\u00a0 company.\n   What still needs to be proven, experts say, is whether mRNA vaccines\u00a0can help win the battle against cancer, and if so, which approach will be better for which patients.\n The federal government  currently lists 29 studies\u00a0underway or will be soon investigating mRNA cancer vaccines.\n Because these therapies\u00a0are still experimental, there&#39;s no talk yet of how much they will cost. Patients don&#39;t pay to participate in clinical research trials.\n  To be worth any cost, mRNA vaccines will have to make a significant impact on survival, adding years not just weeks to someone&#39;s life, said Sullivan, at Mass. General.\u00a0He would consider them justified\u00a0if they could boost the long-term survival rate, which now hovers around 30%-40%, to 50%-80%.\n Dr. David Braun\u00a0a medical oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said it&#39;s always better to not make too may promises to cancer patients.\n &#34;As excited as I am about developments, I try to be cautious about overpromising,&#34; he said. &#34;Almost everyone knows someone who has not had effective therapy.&#34;\n But the fact that immune therapy has cured some cancer patients suggests there will be a way to spread those benefits to others, he said.\n In addition to treatment and prevention, mRNA can be used to turn the patient&#39;s body into a cancer drug-making machine.\n  Today, drugs like  Herceptin, which have been transformational in treating breast cancer, have to be produced in huge fermenters. These need to be kept clean and constantly scanned for imperfections, BioNTech&#39;s T\u00fcreci said.\n Instead, using mRNA technology, the patient&#39;s body could be triggered to produce the protein itself. &#34;It&#39;s an elegant and fast method, which does not need big production plants,&#34; she said.\n This research is in an early stage, T\u00fcreci noted, and details like\u00a0how often someone would need to be dosed have not yet been worked out.\n   It&#39;s made mRNA almost a household term around the world. It&#39;s proven the technology can work. And it&#39;s shown that mRNA can be made very quickly and at a tremendously large scale.\n Moderna produced its first doses of COVID-19 vaccine just two months after getting the genetic sequence of the virus \u2013 proving\u00a0that such\u00a0fast delivery is feasible, Moore said.\n Making a cancer vaccine is trickier.\u00a0With COVID, the virus&#39; genetic code led directly to a vaccine candidate, but with cancer, the tumor&#39;s genes have to be sequenced and the most potentially useful ones identified.\n  Experience with COVID-19 also helped boost production of mRNA to levels that would have seemed unbelievable just a decade ago, Moore said.\n &#34;I, in my wildest dreams\u00a0\u2026\u00a0would never have imagined that we&#39;d be making the quantities and quality of mRNA molecules we&#39;re making now with. If you had told me we were going to be doing this, I&#39;d have said you are completely crazy,&#34; she said, praising the engineers. &#34;Every time I think, &#39;Oh my God, we can&#39;t do any better than that,&#39; they surprise me.&#34;\n  It also showed how much easier it is to tackle an infectious disease like COVID-19 than cancer.\n &#34;What this taught me is gosh, it&#39;s really difficult to work in the cancer field,&#34; said T\u00fcreci, a long-time cancer researcher.\n With COVID-19, thousands of people were falling ill every day, yielding plenty of volunteers for clinical trials. It only took a few months to determine that BioNTech&#39;s vaccine provided strong protection. In cancer trials,\u00a0all five cancer centers in Germany might get only two eligible patients a month, she said. And it might be two to five years before researchers can be sure they are truly preventing someone&#39;s cancer from coming back.\n Cancer trials also were delayed during the worst of the COVID-19 outbreak\u00a0because patients couldn&#39;t make it in for treatments.\n Getting to this point was the product of decades of work by herself and others.\n &#34;There was so much to invest in terms of effort and innovation,&#34; T\u00fcreci said. &#34;Having had the opportunity\u00a0to show with the COVID vaccine that mRNA as such works is also very encouraging.&#34;\n   Fentress and his wife Jennie caught COVID-19 right after getting their first dose of vaccine.\n  They had to reschedule their second shots, but got them a few weeks later. &#34;I don&#39;t quite understand why people would refuse,&#34; said Fentress who described it as an insurance policy. &#34;I&#39;m a big fan of science and technology and stuff like that.&#34;\n  Now, he&#39;s happy he got cancer when he did. &#34;Any earlier or any later I wouldn&#39;t have gotten to participate&#34; in the clinical trial.\n  &#34;(They&#39;ve) given me a bunch of hope. They sure have,&#34; Fentress said.\u00a0&#34;If you don&#39;t have hope, you don&#39;t have any future.&#34;\n  Health and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

But\u00a0other analyses by the group \u2014 including an  update shared on Friday \u2014 have zeroed in on confirmed cases.\n  &#34;Curiously, we did notice that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab,&#34; the team  wrote, noting anyone who&#39;s been vaccinated and starts sneezing frequently should consider getting tested.\n      In his statement, Spector stressed the shift in\u00a0top-reported symptoms could be tied to the delta variant.\n      But others say it&#39;s less likely that this highly-transmissible variant is causing an actual change in symptoms, and more likely that other factors \u2014 including the age of those getting infected, as Spector noted \u2014 may be behind the milder symptom reports.\n  Several Canadian experts who spoke to CBC News say vaccination programs prioritizing older adults, and a greater awareness of the range of symptoms, could both be playing a role in the shift, and it&#39;s a trend that could change how governments test and track COVID-19 infections in the months ahead.\n    Dr. Zain Chagla, an infectious diseases specialist with McMaster University in Hamilton, Ont., noted similar self-reported symptom\u00a0data doesn&#39;t exist\u00a0in Canada.\n  Still, he said it&#39;s likely COVID-19 is appearing more often as a cold-like illness here as well, not just the U.K., as more residents get vaccinated.\n  That could mean some people don&#39;t even realize they&#39;re infected, with more cases of mild COVID-19 flying under the radar.\n  &#34;I would blame this more on factors in the hosts,&#34; said Chagla, &#34;not the virus itself.&#34;\n    With older populations prioritized for vaccinations, younger people are more susceptible to getting infected from any coronavirus strain, and Chagla said they&#39;re more likely to have milder symptoms \u2014 unlike the acute shortness of breath and coughing typically associated with COVID-19 in more vulnerable age groups.\n  Canada&#39;s federal government   currently lists a new or worsening cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, and a temperature equal to or over 38 C \u2014 or even just feeling feverish \u2014 among the top symptoms suggesting someone may have COVID-19.\n  But the symptoms can &#34;vary from person to person,&#34; officials note, with other possibilities including chills, fatigue, body aches, new loss of smell or taste, or gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea or vomiting.\n    Drawing comparisons between earlier and later rounds of symptom reporting may be tough since the age range of those still vulnerable to getting infected\u00a0is changing, said infectious diseases specialist Dr. Andrew Morris, a professor at the University of Toronto.\n  &#34;I think what we will find over time is that symptoms almost certainly vary according to age, and they may also vary according to strain or variants,&#34; he said.\n    It&#39;s also still not entirely clear why certain people have severe forms of the illness while others might not even know they&#39;re infected. Factors like older age and pre-existing health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, can\u00a0lead to worse medical outcomes,   studies have long shown, though there have been rarer instances of young, healthy adults and children winding up hospitalized or even dying.\n  Jason Kindrachuk, a virologist and assistant professor at the University of Manitoba, noted that rising reports of mild symptoms on the U.K. app could also be tied to another factor: ever-greater awareness of the illness and the range of symptoms it causes.\n  &#34;Is it truly that these are things that are related to some difference in the disease?&#34; he questioned.\n  &#34;Or is it more that we now are maybe more appreciative of those kind of minute differences, or those changes in our own health, and now maybe a little bit more prone to reporting those?&#34;\n        While it&#39;s good news\u00a0if COVID-19 truly shows up more often like a common cold, a\u00a0shift in commonly-experienced symptoms could have an impact on how regions tackle the rest of the pandemic.\n  Experts have warned   pockets of the population with lower vaccination rates are still at risk for infections, and Chagla said milder experiences that don&#39;t warrant a trip to a testing centre or hospital\u00a0could make it harder to track the virus&#39; spread within vulnerable settings in the months ahead.\n    &#34;It&#39;s going to make testing, as a strategy, a whole lot more difficult,&#34; he explained. &#34;Especially with common symptoms being something like a headache \u2014 people get headaches for a lot of reasons.&#34;\n  That means community-based testing won&#39;t be a feasible option\u00a0in Canada\u00a0for much longer despite being a staple throughout much of the pandemic,\u00a0Chagla said,\u00a0since it&#39;s hard to expect people to rush out for a test at every run-of-the-mill symptom.\n  Instead, he said the focus should be on a targeted approach, such as testing patients for COVID-19 when they enter a hospital, or routine tests within other congregate-care settings.\n  Schools in particular should be a focus this fall, Chagla added, since, as it stands, only Canadian youth aged 12 and up are eligible to be vaccinated, leaving younger school-aged kids unprotected.\n  &#34;We have to think about this long-term in terms of how we do surveillance, and how we monitor people, and what populations we continue to test,&#34; he said.\n    Kindrachuk also questioned whether people will fall back into old patterns once COVID-19 becomes less of a threat, or if the lessons of the pandemic \u2014 such as\u00a0staying home when sick \u2014 will stick in the years ahead.\n  &#34;I hope it&#39;s the latter\u2026 we&#39;ve seen how quickly public health can change based on very self-driven or self-mediated responses, whether it&#39;s masking and staying at home or those types of activities,&#34; he said.\n    Various public health\u00a0measures will stay in place\u00a0while Canada reopens, and so far, that step-by-step process in most provinces has shown progress with\u00a0  rapidly-rising vaccination rates pushing down case growth,   curbing the death toll, and easing pressure on the country&#39;s hospital system.\n  And, if the U.K. experience with shifting symptom reports proves true here as well, it could mean\u00a0more\u00a0people\u00a0are\u00a0experiencing COVID-19 as a far milder respiratory infection than the devastating illness that has taken\u00a0the lives of 26 thousand Canadians over the last year-and-a-half.\n  &#34;If you take the risk profile down to influenza, it fundamentally changes how we deal with this pathogen ... it&#39;s not something that shuts down society,&#34; Chagla said.\n    This is an excerpt from Second Opinion, a weekly roundup of health and medical science news emailed to\u00a0  subscribers every Saturday morning.
