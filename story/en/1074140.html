The ones that just constantly pop up, that&#39;s generally on the Google Play store, although I have seen a couple of those Unpacking Game Guides on iOS as well, and I&#39;ve had them taken down.</p><p>&#34;需要对应用程序进行更适度的审查，并[从移动平台持有者那里]进行更彻底的审查，&#34；解包创意总监雷恩·布里尔说&#34;它&#39；应用商店更好，我们&#39；我在那里看到的克隆人要少得多。那些经常出现的，那&#39；虽然我在iOS上也看到过一些解包游戏指南，但它一般都在Google Play store上，我&#39；我已经把它们取下来了。</p><p> &#34;It&#39;s a bit ridiculous that I have to, several times a week, go into the Google Play store, and go, &#39;Let&#39;s see how many clones we have now&#39;&#34;</p><p>&#34;它&#39；这有点可笑，我不得不一周去几次谷歌Play商店，然后去&#39；让&#39；看看我们现在有多少克隆人&#39&#34;</p><p> &#34;It&#39;s a bit ridiculous that I have to, several times a week, go into the Google Play store, and go, &#39;Let&#39;s see how many clones we have now,&#39; and none of them are even real games. They&#39;re literally just some scammers trying to make a quick buck using someone else&#39;s art and a bunch of ads. There is no benefit to your users from that. Just moderate this. Why does it need to waste your users&#39; time, and waste developers&#39; time, to constantly try to get those taken down?&#34;</p><p>&#34;它&#39；这有点可笑，我不得不一周去几次谷歌Play商店，然后去&#39；让&#39；让我们看看我们现在有多少克隆人；它们都不是真正的游戏。他们&#39；你真的只是一些骗子试图利用别人快速赚钱#39；这是艺术和一堆广告。这对你的用户没有好处。只是缓和一下。为什么它需要浪费你的用户&#39；时间和浪费开发者&#39；时间，不断地尝试着把这些取下来&#34;</p><p> At least one game borrowed Unpacking&#39;s mechanics and replicated its art almost scene for scene. Witch Beam was very vocal on  Twitter about this one clone, which helped accelerate the process of it being removed.</p><p>至少有一款游戏借用了解包#39；他几乎一幕一幕地复制了它的艺术。Witch Beam在Twitter上对这一克隆人发表了强烈的言论，这有助于加快它被移除的过程。</p><p> &#34;I actually did file a claim,&#34; Brier says. &#34;This is the first thing I always do, I go to the Google Play store, and I go, &#39;Hey, copyright infringement. Can you take this down?&#39; And I send pictures. That one, because it was a bit more complicated than just straight up using our art, I organised a whole folder of pictures for comparison. And the response I got back was, &#39;We&#39;ve decided not to take action on this. You can reach out to the developer directly.&#39; What will that achieve? They knowingly cloned the game. The only thing I can possibly do is send them a legal threat. That&#39;s costly, and takes a lot of energy, and we&#39;re tired. We just released a game! We&#39;re still exhausted.&#34;</p><p>&#34;我确实提出了索赔&#34；布里尔说&#34;这是我经常做的第一件事，我去谷歌Play商店，然后我去&#39；嘿，侵犯版权。你能把这个拿下来吗&#39; 我会发照片。这一次，因为它比直接使用我们的艺术要复杂一些，我组织了一个完整的图片文件夹进行比较。我得到的回复是&#39；我们&#39；我决定不采取行动了。你可以直接联系开发者&#39; 这将实现什么？他们故意克隆了这个游戏。我唯一能做的就是向他们发出法律威胁。那&#39；这很昂贵，需要消耗大量能源，而我们&#39；你累了。我们刚刚发布了一个游戏！我们&#39；你仍然精疲力竭&#34;</p><p>  Nick Allan, legal director and head of interactive entertainment at law firm Lewis Silkin, points out in a statement sent to  GamesIndustry.biz that legislation in terms of copyright is dated in many territories, making cases such as mobile clones difficult to tackle.</p><p>Lewis Silkin律师事务所的法律总监兼互动娱乐主管尼克·艾伦在发给GamesIndustry的一份声明中指出。biz表示，许多地区的版权立法已经过时，这使得移动克隆等案件难以处理。</p><p> &#34;The UK&#39;s IP system is not currently very well equipped to protect studios from clone games,&#34; he says. &#34;At least where there is no confusion or misrepresentation that the clone game is actually the original, it will often come down to a copyright claim that the visual appearance of the clone game is too close to the original.</p><p>&#34;英国&#39；s的IP系统目前还没有很好的设备来保护工作室免受克隆游戏的攻击；他说&#34;至少在没有混淆或误传克隆人游戏实际上是原创的情况下，它通常会归结为版权声明，即克隆人游戏的视觉外观与原创太接近。</p><p> &#34;Unfortunately, the copyright legislation [in the UK] dates from 1988 and the leading Court of Appeal decision dates from 2007, which is well before the current era of hypercasual mobile games. In Nova v Mazooma, the court held that there was copyright in the visual appearance of a game, but the court&#39;s approach of comparing screenshots of the respective games does not always do justice to protecting original games. For example, it is difficult to show animation, gameplay elements and overall look-and-feel from static screenshots alone.</p><p>&#34;不幸的是，（英国）的版权立法始于1988年，而主要的上诉法院判决则始于2007年，远远早于当前的超时空移动游戏时代。在Nova v Mazooma案中，法院认为游戏的视觉外观有版权，但法院&#39；s比较各自游戏的截图的方法并不总是公平地保护原创游戏。例如，仅从静态屏幕截图很难显示动画、游戏元素和整体外观。</p><p> &#34;Other jurisdictions may be regarded as more sympathetic to claimants than the UK, but it generally remains a difficult area to enforce in both law and practice,&#34; he continues. &#34;From a practical perspective, enforcement of IP rights in a mobile games context, especially the hypercasual genre, can be difficult as well because of their faster development times, sometimes shorter shelf-life and the cross-border issues associated with platforms, studios and users around the world. Legislators in the UK and other legal systems may wish to consider reforming copyright more generally to make it more fit for the age of the metaverse and the iPhone rather than Telex and Teletext.&#34;</p><p>&#34;其他司法管辖区可能被认为比英国更同情索赔人，但在法律和实践中，这通常仍然是一个难以执行的领域，#34；他继续说&#34;从实践的角度来看，在手机游戏环境中，尤其是超立方体类型中，执行知识产权也可能很困难，因为它们的开发时间更快，有时保质期更短，以及与世界各地的平台、工作室和用户相关的跨国界问题。英国的立法者和其他法律系统可能希望更普遍地改革版权，使其更适合于元时代和iPhone时代，而不是电传和图文电视。34;</p><p> The Unpacking clone in question ended up at the top of the free-to-play charts on iOS, with Apple not even sending a response to Witch Beam after it filed the initial claim.</p><p>在iOS上，被质疑的解包克隆最终成为免费播放图表的榜首，苹果在提交最初声明后甚至没有向Witch Beam发送回复。</p><p> &#34;While it was really nice that once a lot of people got very angry about it, Apple decided to take it down, that should have happened without us needing to get all of Twitter to be talking about it,&#34; Brier says.</p><p>&#34;当很多人对它感到非常愤怒时，苹果公司决定把它取下来，这真的很好，而我们不需要让Twitter上的所有人都在谈论它，这本应该发生的，&#34；布里尔说。</p><p> At the time of our conversation, Brier says she has reported over 30 Unpacking clones so far, most of them on Android.</p><p>在我们谈话的时候，布里尔说她已经报告了30多个解包克隆，其中大部分是安卓系统。</p><p> This feeling of exhaustion she expresses is shared by Rami Ismail. The developer, formerly one half of Vlambeer, has talked about clones extensively in the past following the  widely-covered existence of Ridiculous Fishing copies. In both Unpacking and Ridiculous Fishing&#39;s cases, clones started emerging even before their releases.</p><p>拉米·伊斯梅尔也有这种疲惫感。这位开发者曾是Vlambeer的一半，在被广泛报道存在荒谬的钓鱼拷贝之后，他过去曾广泛谈论过克隆。在解包和荒谬的钓鱼中&#39；在美国，克隆甚至在发布之前就开始出现。</p><p> &#34;Legal systems may wish to consider reforming copyright more generally to make it more fit for the age of the metaverse and the iPhone rather than Telex and Teletext&#34;</p><p>&#34;法律系统可能希望更普遍地考虑改革版权，使其更适合于元时代和iPhone时代，而不是电传和图文电视和第34版；</p><p> &#34;In our case, [the reaction] was mostly panic,&#34; Ismail recalls. &#34;You go into games [hoping] that your creativity will be rewarded in some way, shape, or form. It turns out when that faith is shaken, it&#39;s very scary. Competition in the games industry tends to be in relatively good faith. And clones are the opposite of that. They&#39;re the most cynical expression of competition. It&#39;s not something that we&#39;re used to, in the games industry, even though it happens remarkably often. Most of the games industry is so supportive and so cooperative that even though all of us are competing for the same market space, there&#39;s a sort of good sportspersonship going on, and when that gets violated it&#39;s shocking.</p><p>&#34;在我们的案例中，[反应]大多是恐慌，&#34；伊斯梅尔回忆道&#34;你进入游戏[希望]你的创造力会以某种方式、形状或形式得到回报。事实证明，当这种信念动摇时，它&#39；太可怕了。游戏行业的竞争往往是相对诚实的。而克隆则恰恰相反。他们&#39；你是竞争最愤世嫉俗的表现。它&#39；这不是我们&#39；我们已经习惯了，在游戏行业，尽管它经常发生。大多数游戏行业都非常支持和合作，即使我们所有人都在为同一个市场空间竞争，也有&#39；这是一种良好的体育精神，当这种精神受到侵犯时&#39；太令人震惊了。</p><p> &#34;In our case, it was very disorienting and the thing I did immediately was burn out, which I can&#39;t recommend doing. Luckily after that, I got angry. And my anger overcame my hesitation to email some of the biggest news websites in the world and we ended up in the New York Times and it got out of hand from there. Vlambeer ended up as a flash point in the early discussions about cloning.&#34;</p><p>&#34;在我们的案例中，这让我很迷惑，我马上就做了一件事，我可以&#39；我不建议这样做。幸运的是，在那之后，我生气了。我的愤怒战胜了我在给世界上一些最大的新闻网站发电子邮件时的犹豫，我们最终登上了《纽约时报》，然后就失控了。Vlamber最终成为了早期关于克隆的讨论的一个热点&#34;</p><p> He points out that in the case of both Unpacking and Ridiculous Fishing, the situation is made more painful by the fact nothing quite like those games existed prior to their respective launches.</p><p>他指出，在拆包和荒谬捕鱼的情况下，情况变得更加痛苦，因为在各自的游戏发布之前，没有一款游戏与这些游戏完全相同。</p><p> &#34;Creating them takes a tremendous amount of research and a tremendous amount of testing, just going over, &#39;Okay, how do I put this thing down so that it feels good? Does shooting a fish feel good, does catching a fish feel good&#39;? There weren&#39;t rules for that. But it&#39;s really easy to copy it after it&#39;s done. You just look at what we did and you just do that too, and you can be done in a few weeks copying a game like Unpacking, even though it takes years to make it.&#34;</p><p>&#34;创建它们需要大量的研究和大量的测试，只需回顾一下，&#39；好吧，我该如何放下这东西，让它感觉良好？打鱼感觉好吗，抓鱼感觉好吗；？没有&#39；这不是规则。但它&#39；它之后真的很容易复制#39；结束了。你只需看看我们做了什么，你也可以这么做，你可以在几周内复制一个游戏，比如解包，尽管制作它需要几年时间&#34;</p><p> On the topic of platform holders&#39; responsibility, Ismail says that once it becomes clear that there is a &#34;pandemic&#34; of a certain game getting cloned there should be processes to simplify these getting removed.</p><p>关于平台持有者的话题&#39；责任，伊斯梅尔说，一旦明确存在&#34；大流行&#34；对于某个游戏被克隆，应该有一些过程来简化这些被删除的过程。</p><p> &#34;The burden on the developer is large. You have to go in, you have to see these clones and check them out every day. So you&#39;re just sitting there every day waking up and going, &#39;Okay, let&#39;s fill out 27 of these forms&#39;. It&#39;s just incredibly demoralising.</p><p>&#34;开发商的负担很大。你必须进去，你必须看到这些克隆人，并每天检查它们。所以你&#39；我们只是每天都坐在那里，醒来后就走，&#39；好吧，让&#39；让我们填写其中27张表格；。它&#39；这简直令人沮丧。</p><p> &#34;If the same company has to submit the same thing very rapidly ten times, 15 times, for several days in a row, there should probably be some sort of escalation that makes somebody at Apple, or Google, or whatever platform, reach out to developer and go: &#39;Okay, let&#39;s go over what this case is exactly and then we&#39;ll just temporarily have some sort of system in place that that can work with this&#39;.&#34;</p><p>&#34;如果同一家公司必须连续几天以非常快的速度提交10次、15次相同的内容，那么可能会有某种升级，让苹果、谷歌或任何平台的人接触到开发者并离开：&#39；好吧，让&#39；让我们看看这个案子到底是什么，然后我们&#39；我只是暂时有一个系统可以处理这个&#39&#34;</p><p>  Clones impact small developers in more than one way, but the most direct consequence for Witch Beam was a rise in confused players which in turn can grow into bad PR for the studio and its staff being overwhelmed by demands.</p><p>克隆人对小型开发者的影响不止一个方面，但对Witch Beam来说，最直接的后果是困惑的玩家数量增加，这反过来可能会发展为工作室糟糕的公关，其员工也会被需求压得喘不过气来。</p><p> &#34;People were going to our website and being confused, thinking that this is part of the sign-up process to play the game through this app that they got, and signing up to our mailing list thinking that they&#39;re signing up to play the game,&#34; Brier explains. &#34;We were just flooded with mailing list sign-ups, which then brought us up a tier on Mailchimp, for these low-quality subscribers. And they&#39;re low quality because they don&#39;t want to be subscribers, and they might even mark us as spam if they get our emails.</p><p>&#34;人们来到我们的网站，感到困惑，认为这是注册过程的一部分，通过他们获得的这个应用程序玩游戏，并注册到我们的邮件列表，认为他们&#39；重新注册玩游戏，&#34；布里尔解释道&#34;我们刚刚收到了大量的邮件列表注册，这让我们在Mailchimp上为这些低质量的订阅者增加了一层。他们&#39；他们的质量很低，因为他们没有&#39；我不想成为订户，如果他们收到我们的电子邮件，他们甚至可能会将我们标记为垃圾邮件。</p><p> &#34;In terms of financial impact, mostly it stems from the impact on our brand, and [causing] brand confusion, giving people a bad experience with what they think is our game. Unpacking relies really heavily on word-of-mouth, and on having a good reputation, and being shared, and so if some people go, &#39;Actually, I played Unpacking and it sucked,&#39; because they played some clone full of ads, that&#39;s a really bad thing for our game unless that perception is corrected.&#34;</p><p>&#34;就财务影响而言，它主要源于对我们品牌的影响，并[造成]品牌混乱，让人们对他们认为是我们的游戏产生了不良体验。解包在很大程度上依赖于口碑、良好的声誉和被分享，因此如果有人去了，&#39；事实上，我玩的是解包游戏，它很烂，&#39；因为他们播放了一些满是广告的克隆人，那&#39；除非这种看法得到纠正，否则这对我们的比赛来说真的是件坏事&#34;</p><p> &#34;It took me out for six months when Ridiculous Fishing got cloned, and that almost killed the studio&#34;</p><p>&#34;荒谬的钓鱼被克隆后，我花了六个月的时间，这几乎毁掉了工作室&#34；</p><p> She adds that mobile clones can take sales away from other platforms as there&#39;s a crossover between mobile players and console/PC players.</p><p>她补充说，移动克隆产品可以从其他平台上抢走销售，因为在那里#39；它是移动播放器和控制台/PC播放器的交叉点。</p><p> &#34;Yes, they are their own market, but a lot of people own multiple devices, or own a phone and a PC. So while there is a whole audience that we have not tapped into and currently doesn&#39;t have access to Unpacking, a whole bunch of them still do. So it does take away from those sales.</p><p>&#34;是的，他们是他们自己的市场，但很多人拥有多台设备，或者拥有一部手机和一台PC。因此，虽然我们还没有接触到整个受众，但目前没有&#39；我无法打开包装，他们中的很多人仍然可以。因此，它确实会从这些销售中获益。</p><p> &#34;[In terms of] short-term impact, it was really disruptive to our community as well. All of the tags in our TikTok notifications for days were just those ads. Literally all of the comments on them were just like, &#39;Unpacking, someone stole your game! Sue them!&#39; and things like that. And it was just hundreds and hundreds of these messages. And then on top of that, we were getting half a dozen emails a day, and just constantly people were coming into our Discord to report this, to the point where our mods were discussing if they were able to come up with some kind of bot that would tell people when they ask about that, &#39;We know, please stop talking about this,&#39; and delete the post. It was wearing our mods down, our community down. It was causing stress beyond even just our company.&#34;</p><p>&#34;（就）短期影响而言，它也确实对我们的社区造成了破坏。我们TikTok通知中几天的所有标签都是这些广告。实际上，所有关于它们的评论都像是，&#39；打开行李，有人偷走了你的游戏！起诉他们&#39; 诸如此类。只有成百上千条这样的信息。除此之外，我们每天都会收到六封电子邮件，人们不断地闯入我们的纠纷中报告这件事，以至于我们的MOD正在讨论他们是否能够想出某种机器人，当人们问起这件事时，他们会告诉他们，&#39；我们知道，请不要再谈论这个了；并删除帖子。这让我们的mods和我们的社区都崩溃了。它造成的压力甚至超出了我们公司的范围&#34;</p><p> Ismail says measuring the financial impact of Ridiculous Fishing clones is &#34;impossible,&#34; and that he will never know for sure, even ten years later. But he adds that the real issue with clones is elsewhere anyway.</p><p>伊斯梅尔说，衡量荒谬的捕鱼克隆的财务影响是&#34；不可能&#34；即使十年后，他也永远无法确定。但他补充说，克隆人的真正问题在于其他地方。</p><p> &#34;Ultimately the most dangerous thing is that it can get to your head. And it can really get you down and it took me out for six months when Ridiculous Fishing got cloned, and that almost killed the studio.</p><p>&#34;归根结底，最危险的事情是它会触及你的头脑。这真的会让你失望，当荒谬的钓鱼被克隆时，我花了六个月的时间，差点毁了工作室。</p><p> &#34;[You need to] make sure you have a good support network that understands that, however ridiculous it may sound, you made something so extraordinary that other people want to cynically copy it. The sad thing is it still hurts because it&#39;s still that quiet agreement that we are playing in good faith, that is pulled away from you. And for me personally, that burnout did affect my life. And that hurt and that distress that you have, it did hurt me for a bit.&#34;</p><p>&#34;（你需要）确保你有一个良好的支持网络，能够理解，无论听起来多么荒谬，你做了一些非常了不起的事情，以至于其他人想愤世嫉俗地复制它。可悲的是，它仍然很痛，因为它&#39；这仍然是一个安静的协议，我们是真诚的，这是从你身边拉走的。对我个人来说，这种倦怠确实影响了我的生活。你的伤痛和痛苦确实让我受了一点伤害&#34;</p><p> He points out that the amount of pain a clone can create is especially important when the copy ends up overshadowing the original, as was the case for 2048 taking over Threes.</p><p>他指出，当复制品最终盖过原作时，克隆人所能造成的痛苦程度尤其重要，就像2048年接手三部一样。</p><p> Brier points out that it&#39;s possible that, if Unpacking copies don&#39;t stop popping up at the rate that they do, Witch Beam may have to hire someone to remove them.</p><p>布里尔指出它&#39；如果拆封的副本不&#39；如果他们不能停止以这种速度出现，Witch Beam可能不得不雇佣一个人来移除他们。</p><p> &#34;It&#39;s really wearing me thin,&#34; she says. &#34;I am afraid of &#39;What if this clone comes back?&#39; for example. We&#39;re fine now because these are gone, [but only] until the next clone shows up. Every time it happens, it&#39;s exhausting and stressful, and you don&#39;t know how it&#39;ll go, and I don&#39;t think that every single time we can go on Twitter and say, &#39;Please help us, everybody.&#39; People will get tired of that.&#34;</p><p>&#34;它&#39；她真的让我精疲力竭；她说&#34;我害怕&#39；如果这个克隆人回来了怎么办&#39; 例如我们&#39；We’我们现在很好，因为在下一个克隆出现之前，这些都不见了。每一次都是&#39；It’这让人筋疲力尽，压力很大，而你不&#39；我不知道是怎么回事&#39；我去，我不去&#39；我不认为每次我们都能在Twitter上说，&#39；请大家帮帮我们&#39; 人们会对此感到厌倦&#34;</p><p> &#34;You won&#39;t get cloned unless your game has a chance of being successful, but if your game has a chance of being successful, you should market it so it can be&#34;</p><p>&#34;你赢了&#39；除非你的游戏有成功的机会，否则你不会被克隆，但如果你的游戏有成功的机会，你应该把它推向市场，这样它就可以&#34；</p><p> Avoiding clones is almost mission impossible for successful indies, with Ismail highlighting a catch-22 facing all developers.</p><p>对于成功的独立企业来说，避免克隆几乎是不可能完成的任务，伊斯梅尔强调了所有开发者都面临的第22条军规。</p><p> &#34;A lot of people do think about [how to promote their game without giving away too much to avoid clones]. And I actually, ironically, recommend them not to think about that. Because the honest truth is if Unpacking had not promoted their game at all and hadn&#39;t been open about their development, it wouldn&#39;t have been cloned, but it also likely wouldn&#39;t have been successful.</p><p>&#34;很多人确实在考虑[如何在不放弃太多以避免克隆的情况下推广他们的游戏]。事实上，讽刺的是，我建议他们不要考虑这个问题。因为诚实的事实是，如果解包根本没有促进他们的游戏，而且没有&#39；如果不公开他们的发展，它就不会&#39；它没有被克隆，但也可能不会&#39；我们没有成功。</p><p> &#34;You won&#39;t get cloned unless your game has a chance of being successful, but if your game has a chance of being successful, you should market it so it can be.&#34;</p><p>&#34;你赢了&#39；除非你的游戏有成功的机会，否则你不会被克隆。但是如果你的游戏有成功的机会，你应该把它推向市场，这样它才能成功&#34;</p><p> Brier says that Unpacking being a narrative-driven game disguised as a puzzle game worked in their favour as far as clones are concerned.</p><p>布里尔说，就克隆人而言，解包是一款伪装成益智游戏的叙事驱动游戏，对他们有利。</p><p> &#34;We were almost -- not on purpose -- hiding something. After we released, we realised that there were a lot of people that didn&#39;t realise that there would be a story, and the story is the main draw of the game. So, it&#39;s like everyone thought that they were going to play this puzzle game, and then it&#39;s like, &#39;Psyche! You&#39;re playing a narrative game, actually.&#39;</p><p>&#34;我们几乎——不是故意——隐瞒了什么。在我们发布之后，我们意识到有很多人没有&#39；我没有意识到会有一个故事，而这个故事是游戏的主要吸引力。所以它&#39；好像每个人都以为他们要玩这个益智游戏，然后它&#39；比如&#39；心理你&#39；实际上，我们在玩叙事游戏&#39;</p><p> &#34;And so, these clones, they weren&#39;t trying to emulate the part about our game that was actually what we think is its strongest point. And then the other thing is just the game is extremely dense and extremely detailed, and the quality bar is high. You can&#39;t just put together a clone of Unpacking that&#39;s as good as Unpacking in three months because it&#39;s just not a game that&#39;s possible to put together in three months. Yes, you can definitely slap together a bunch of assets and model a room, and let someone put those items around the room, and even take them out of a box, but it&#39;s not going to be the same. It&#39;s just going to feel like the amount of work that you put into it, basically.&#34;</p><p>&#34;所以，这些克隆人，他们不是&#39；我们不会试图模仿我们比赛中我们认为最重要的部分。另一件事是，游戏非常密集，非常详细，质量很高。你可以&#39；不要只是把它的复制品拆开&#39；3个月后拆箱就好了，因为它&#39；这可不是一场&#39；It’三个月内完成是可能的。是的，你完全可以把一堆资产拼凑起来，做一个房间的模型，让别人把这些东西放在房间里，甚至把它们从盒子里拿出来，但是&#39；那就不一样了。它&#39；基本上，你会感觉到你投入的工作量&#34;</p><p>  Ultimately, the big question is: what can you do to combat clones? And in reality there&#39;s not a whole lot you can do. Or what you can do could legally jeopardise how game development works for future generations.</p><p>最终，一个大问题是：你能做些什么来对抗克隆人？事实上&#39；你能做的不多。或者，你所能做的可能会在法律上危及游戏开发如何为子孙后代服务。</p><p> &#34;The biggest fear we had with Ridiculous Fishing is that there was obviously a lot of interest from lawyers who wanted to take on the case and said, &#39;we can protect your work&#39;,&#34; Ismail recalls. &#34;But then other lawyers would say, &#39;we could protect your work but if we succeed it might set precedent as to the protection of game design&#39;. That&#39;s scary because if that happens somebody might say, &#39;Jumping is ours now&#39;. There&#39;s precedent in the games industry for patents, but it&#39;s usually very specific things like playing mini-games on loading screens.</p><p>&#34;对于荒谬的钓鱼，我们最大的担忧是，显然有很多律师对这个案子感兴趣，他们想接手这个案子，并说，&#39；我们可以保护你的工作&#39&#34; 伊斯梅尔回忆道&#34;但其他律师会说&#39；我们可以保护你的作品，但如果我们成功了，它可能会成为保护游戏设计的先例；。那&#39；这很可怕，因为如果发生这种情况，有人可能会说，&#39；跳跃现在是我们的了；。那里&#39；这是游戏行业专利申请的先例，但它&#39；这通常是非常具体的事情，比如在加载屏幕上玩迷你游戏。</p><p> &#34;But the idea of a generic game design element being protected by copyright laws is terrifying. Most of my games are built on other games, are built on translations of mechanics or ideas. If flying in a game was protected, then Luftrausers wouldn&#39;t exist. So the best thing you can do is just sort of swat the flies as they come up and just DMCA those games.&#34;</p><p>&#34;但是，一个通用游戏设计元素受到版权法保护的想法是可怕的。我的大多数游戏都是建立在其他游戏的基础上，是建立在力学或思想的翻译上。如果在游戏中飞行受到保护，那么德国空军就不会&#39；不存在。所以你能做的最好的事情就是在苍蝇飞来的时候拍打它们，然后在游戏中进行DMCA&#34;</p><p> &#34;[Clones] weren&#39;t trying to emulate the part about our game that was actually what we think is its strongest point&#34;</p><p>&#34;[克隆人]39岁；t试图模仿我们的游戏中我们认为最重要的部分#34；</p><p> Ismail also recommends claiming ownership of your title in the court of public opinion and in the eyes of the media, as the press usually is a good ally against &#34;empty plagiarism.&#34;</p><p>伊斯梅尔还建议在公众舆论法庭和媒体眼中主张你的头衔所有权，因为媒体通常是反对&#34的好盟友；空洞的剽窃&#34;</p><p> He adds that there will always be people to tell you that you shouldn&#39;t&#39; be upset because cloning means you&#39;re being successful.</p><p>他补充说，总会有人告诉你，你不应该&#39；t&#39；因为克隆意味着你&#39；我们正在成功。</p><p> &#34;But it&#39;s fair to feel ownership of a thing that you&#39;ve worked on for years, and especially if it&#39;s a cynical ripoff,&#34; he says. &#34;Inspiration is one thing and there&#39;s plenty of games that will be inspired by Unpacking that nobody will have a problem with whatsoever. The same way Ridiculous Fishing had a lot of games that were inspired by it and there&#39;s no problem with that whatsoever.</p><p>&#34;但它&#39；对你拥有的东西感到拥有是公平的&#39；我已经工作多年了，尤其是如果它&#39；这是一种愤世嫉俗的剽窃，&#34；他说&#34;灵感是一回事#39；有很多游戏都是从解包中得到启发的，没有人会有任何问题。同样荒谬的钓鱼游戏也有很多灵感来源于此&#39；这一点都没问题。</p><p> &#34;The biggest thing -- and this is why I also recommend people to be loud about their game and to market their game regardless of the potential of cloning -- is if you can make it so that people understand that this game is your game and that these games are a clone of your game, and that the conversation is about how your game is the original, the creative version, that it will generally work out.</p><p>&#34;最重要的一点——这就是为什么我也建议人们大声谈论他们的游戏，并推广他们的游戏，而不管克隆的可能性有多大——是如果你能让人们理解这个游戏是你的游戏，这些游戏是你游戏的克隆，对话是关于你的游戏是如何原创的，创造性的版本，它通常会成功。</p><p> &#34;Threes is an incredible game but 2048 has taken over the public &#39;origin&#39; of the Threes gameplay -- so it doesn&#39;t always work out. But the chances of that working out are much higher than anything else. And then at some point -- and this is really sad to say -- you just have to let go of it, you can keep swatting down those games forever, because they will keep coming up forever.&#34;</p><p>&#34;三分制是一场不可思议的比赛，但2048已经征服了公众#39；起源&#39；在三人游戏中——所以它不#39；我不总是能行。但这种情况发生的几率比其他任何事情都要高。然后在某个时刻——说起来真的很难过——你只需要放下它，你就可以永远打败那些比赛，因为它们将永远持续下去&#34;</p><p>  &#34;I&#39;ve been very clear about Unpacking drawing inspiration from The Sims, Gone Home, and Florence. But it&#39;s not similar to Florence, or Gone Home, or The Sims. It&#39;s its own thing. And even if it was more similar to them, even if we did a game that was like Florence, following a character through a romance using simple mechanics, but everything was bespoke, then that&#39;s fine. That&#39;s not a clone. It&#39;s just a game that&#39;s very similar to Florence. And the same goes for Unpacking.</p><p>&#34;我&#39；我很清楚如何从《模拟人生》、《回家》和《佛罗伦萨》中汲取灵感。但它&#39；这和佛罗伦萨、回家或模拟人生都不一样。它&#39；这是它自己的事情。即使它更像他们，即使我们做了一个像弗洛伦斯一样的游戏，用简单的机制跟随一个角色经历一段浪漫，但一切都是定制的，那么&#39；很好。那&#39；他不是克隆人。它&#39；这只是一个游戏&#39；这和佛罗伦萨很相似。拆包也是一样。</p><p> &#34;If someone were to make a game where you take things out of boxes and organise them around a room, even though there are not a lot of games like this currently, it&#39;s still, &#39;Okay, we&#39;re now building a genre.&#39; That&#39;s allowed, but don&#39;t make it look exactly the same, down to specific items, down to room layouts. And don&#39;t use the same name.&#34;</p><p>&#34;如果有人要做一个游戏，你把东西从盒子里拿出来，在一个房间里组织它们，即使现在没有很多这样的游戏，它&#39；仍然是&#39；好吧，我们&#39；我们现在正在打造一个流派&#39; 那&#39；这是允许的，但是唐&#39；不要让它看起来完全一样，具体到具体的项目，到房间布局。唐&#39；不要用同一个名字&#34;</p><p>  Trademarking your game is a good first step against clones, but there are some caveats with the process.</p><p>对游戏进行商标注册是对抗克隆人的良好第一步，但在这个过程中有一些注意事项。</p><p> &#34;The thing with trademarks is that they are expensive, and they are region-specific,&#34; Brier explains. &#34;If you trademark something in Australia, you&#39;ve got to also trademark it in America, and in Europe, and in New Zealand. You have to pay for each territory that you trademark it in, and across [different] categories. And these costs add up. It&#39;s scary how much they add up. So, for an indie studio working on a game, you don&#39;t know if the game is going to do well, and you don&#39;t have a AAA budget to invest in protecting your game. So, you go, &#39;Well, if it goes well, I&#39;ll trademark it then&#39;.&#34;</p><p>&#34;商标的问题是它们很昂贵，而且是特定于地区的，&#34；布里尔解释道&#34;如果你在澳大利亚注册了某个商标，你&#39；我们还必须在美国、欧洲和新西兰为它注册商标。你必须为每一个你在其中注册商标的地区以及（不同的）类别付费。这些成本加起来。它&#39；他们加起来有多可怕。所以，对于一个制作游戏的独立工作室来说，你不需要&#39；我不知道这场比赛是否会打得好，而你不知道&#39；我没有AAA预算来投资保护你的游戏。所以你去&#39；好吧，如果进展顺利，我&#39；那我就给它打商标&#39&#34;</p><p> The trademarking process can take years sometimes, which is plenty of time for more clones to emerge in the meantime. And while trademarking will protect a name, it doesn&#39;t protect gameplay mechanics.</p><p>商标注册过程有时可能需要数年时间，而与此同时，更多克隆人的出现需要大量时间。虽然商标会保护一个名字，但它不会&#39；我们不能保护游戏机制。</p><p> &#34;It&#39;s not going to prevent people from making games that are very similar to ours if they don&#39;t call them Unpacking, and use their own art. And to be honest, I&#39;m fine with that too. That&#39;s how games evolve and how genres evolve. Even if it does mean that there will be some games that are too similar to Unpacking to my liking, they&#39;re still not going to be infri</p><p>&#34;它&#39；如果人们不&#39；不要叫他们拆包，用他们自己的艺术。老实说，我&#39；我也同意。那&#39；这就是游戏如何演变和类型如何演变。即使这确实意味着会有一些游戏太像我喜欢的解包，它们&#39；我们还是不会被告知</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div
