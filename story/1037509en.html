Today&#39;s column is going to look at the history of some of those characters.</p><p>在我的第一个Commander Legends预览专栏文章中，我解释说，产品的愿景之一是在挑选传奇生物（和鹏洛客）时会有很多基于怀旧的选择。今天的专栏将探讨其中一些角色的历史。</p><p>  I&#39;ll have you guess the first character by asking a trivia question. What card&#39;s flavor text inspired the design of three different cards (one of which is a legendary creature in  Commander Legends) and was referenced in the flavor text of a fourth card?</p><p>  我会问一个琐事问题，让您猜到第一个字符。哪种牌的风味文字启发了三种不同牌的设计（其中一种是Commander Legends中的传奇生物），并在第四张牌的风味文字中得到了引用？</p><p> The answer is  Lhurgoyf from  Ice Age.  Ice Age was designed by a group now referred to as the East Coast Playtesters (Skaff Elias, Jim Lin, Dave Petty, and Chris Page). At the time, the design teams named their own cards and wrote their own flavor text. My research leads me to believe it was either Skaff or Jim that came up with the original flavor text (it was created in an  Ice Age design meeting, and everyone&#39;s memory is a little fuzzy), but Darla Kennerud (one of the  Magic editors at the time) came up with the idea of framing the line by having it be Hans&#39;s sister Saffi who said it, and it being her last words.</p><p> 答案是来自《冰河世纪》的Lhurgoyf。冰河时代是由现在被称为东海岸游戏测试人员的组织（Skaff Elias，Jim Lin，Dave Petty和Chris Page）设计的。当时，设计团队命名了自己的卡片，并编写了自己的风味文字。我的研究使我相信是Skaff或Jim提出了原始的风味文字（它是在Ice Age设计会议上创建的，每个人的记忆都有些模糊），但是Darla Kennerud（其中之一（当时的魔术师编辑）提出了这样的想法：让汉斯的姐姐萨菲（Saffi）说这句话，这是她的遗言。</p><p>  Ice Age came out in the summer of 1995. This was prior to me working fulltime at Wizards. At the time, I was a freelancer doing various projects for the company. One of them was the puzzle column that I used to create for  The Duelist (called  Magic: The Puzzling). Because they wanted the puzzles to use the cards from the latest set, and I had to write the puzzles ahead of time, I was sent what was then called a &#34;godbook,&#34; which was an advanced-copy printing of every card in the set on paper. This means the first time I ever saw  Ice Age was when I opened up an envelope I got from Wizards. I remember loving the  Lhurgoyf flavor text, but I couldn&#39;t talk about it or share it with anyone because I had to keep all the unpublished card information to myself. My love for the flavor text would later find ways of being expressed.</p><p>  《冰河世纪》于1995年夏天问世。这是我在奇才全职工作之前的经历。当时，我是一名自由职业者，为公司做各种项目。其中之一是我曾经为《决斗者》（Duelist）创建的难题专栏（称为Magic：The Puzzling）。因为他们希望拼图使用最新的拼图，而且我不得不提前写拼图，所以我被送来了当时称为＆＃34; godbook＆＃34;的书。这是该套卡中每张卡片的高级复印打印。这意味着我第一次见到《冰河世纪》是当我打开从奇才公司得到的信封时。我记得喜欢Lhurgoyf风味文字，但是我不能谈论它或与任何人分享，因为我必须将所有未发布的卡信息保留给我自己。我对风味文字的热爱将在以后找到表达方式。</p><p>     My first time getting to reference the flavor text on a  Magic card came during  Stronghold when I was on the flavor text writing team. I&#39;d designed a variant of  Lhurgoyf called  Revenant (it was black, had flying, only counted your own graveyard, and was */* instead of */*+1, but it was definitely me making a new  Lhurgoyf). I came up with what I thought was funny flavor text for it (&#34;Not again.&#34; —Hans). My head canon was that Hans, unlike his sister, had managed to escape from the original  Lhurgoyf only to run into a similar creature years later. In my mind, this kind of thing happened to Hans all the time. I&#39;m not sure how Hans, a denizen of Dominaria, got to the plane of Rath, but I thought it was funny enough to not worry about those details. (Nowadays, we wouldn&#39;t do that.) By the way, for extra style points,  Revenant is reprinted in  Commander Legends with the Hans flavor text.</p><p>     我第一次参考Magic Card上的风味文本是在Stronghold期间，当时我在风味文本编写团队中。我设计了一个名为Revenant的Lhurgoyf变体（它是黑色的，有飞行，只计算了自己的墓地，并且是* / *而不是* / * + 1，但这绝对是我在制造新的Lhurgoyf）。我想出了一些我认为很有趣的文字（＆＃34;不再。–Hans）。我的经典是汉斯与他的姐姐不一样，设法逃脱了最初的卢戈夫（Lhurgoyf），几年后又撞上了类似的生物。在我看来，这种事情一直在汉斯身上发生。我不确定多米纳里亚的居民汉斯是如何登上拉斯的飞机的，但是我认为这很有趣，不用担心这些细节。 （现在，我们不会这样做。）顺便说一句，为了获得更多的风格，Revenant在《司令传奇》中以汉斯风味的文字重印。</p><p>  Flash forward many years later when I was working on  Time Spiral. We were trying to find &#34;deep cut&#34; legendary creatures we could make cards out of, and I came up with the idea of using some characters that had only been referenced in flavor text. This resulted in me creating  Norin the Wary and this card:</p><p>  多年后，当我从事《时间螺旋》的工作时，Flash向前发展。我们正在尝试查找“深切”我们可以制作出传奇的生物来制作卡片，而我想到了使用一些仅在风味文字中引用过的字符的想法。这导致我创建了Norin the Wary和这张卡：</p><p>     Not having a lot to go on, I made it so Saffi could sacrifice herself to save another, like her brother Hans, who, from  Revenant&#39;s flavor text, we knew had survived. A number of years later when designing  Unhinged, I created a card called  &#34;Ach! Hans, Run!&#34; which was a top-down design from that name.</p><p>     我没有太多的事情要做，所以我做到了，萨菲可以牺牲自己去拯救另一个人，例如她的兄弟汉斯，她从Revenant的风味文字中知道我们还活了下来。数年后，在设计《 Unhinged》时，我创建了一张名为＆＃34; Ach！的卡片。汉斯，快跑！＆＃34;这是该名称自上而下的设计。 </p><p>     The design was built around making people yell &#34;Ach! Hans, Run! It&#39;s  . . .&#34; It ended up being red-green because that&#39;s what colors supported the mechanics I&#39;d chosen to match the flavor. The card also shows a very buff Hans, although we have no idea if that&#39;s the real Hans of  Lhurgoyf fame or just a person named Hans. (Parents of the multiverse, be careful naming your son Hans.)</p><p>该设计是围绕使人们大喊大叫！汉斯，快跑！它。 。 。＆＃34;它最终变成了红绿色，因为那是支持我选择的与口味匹配的机制的颜色。这张卡上还显示了一个非常增强的汉斯，尽管我们不知道那是真正的汉斯·卢戈伊夫成名还是一个名叫汉斯的人。 （多元宇宙的父母，请谨慎命名您的儿子汉斯。）</p><p>    We now know it was a different Hans, because  Commander Legends allowed us to finally give  Lhurgoyf Hans his own legendary creature card. The card is very cute in that it helps you get out extra creatures to attack with, but they always start by attacking Hans.</p><p>    现在我们知道这是一个不同的汉斯，因为传奇司令官让我们最终给了Lhurgoyf Hans他自己的传奇生物卡。这张卡非常可爱，可以帮助您找出额外的生物来攻击，但它们总是从攻击汉斯开始。</p><p>  And that is how one piece of flavor text inspired three and a half different cards.</p><p>  这就是一种风味文本如何启发三张半不同的卡片的方式。</p><p>   One of my jobs as a  Magic designer is to keep a pulse on the many different audiences playing  Magic. As such, I keep a list of the numerous requests that I get. One such request many years ago was a card to help coin-flip decks. In  Arabian Nights ( Magic&#39;s first expansion), Richard Garfield created three cards that had you flip a coin to determine how the card would work. From that point forward, R&amp;D included the occasional coin-flip card, but other than being on red cards and artifacts, there wasn&#39;t much mechanically tying the coin-flip cards together. The fans of coin flipping said they wanted something that would encourage you to put all the coin-flip cards in the same deck. So, in original  Mirrodin, I was looking for quirky artifact designs and came up with the following card:</p><p>   作为魔术设计师，我的工作之一是保持与许多使用魔术的听众的心动。因此，我保留了收到的众多请求的列表。许多年前，这样的要求是一张卡片，以帮助硬币翻转卡组。在《阿拉伯之夜》（Magic的第一个扩展）中，理查德·加菲尔德（Richard Garfield）创建了三张卡片，让您掷硬币来确定该卡片的工作方式。从那时起，R＆amp; D偶尔会使用硬币翻转卡，但是除了使用红色卡片和人工制品外，没有很多机械方法将硬币翻转卡捆绑在一起。掷硬币的粉丝们说，他们想要一些鼓励您将所有抛硬币卡放在同一副牌上的东西。因此，在原始的Mirrodin中，我一直在寻找古怪的工件设计，并提出了以下卡片：</p><p> Lucky Coin 1 Artifact Whenever you would flip a coin, instead flip two coins and choose which one not to count.</p><p> 幸运硬币1神器每当您要掷硬币时，而是要掷两枚硬币并选择不计的硬币。</p><p>    The cost changed from one to two, the template got cleaned up, and they made it legendary. The latter happened because the card got a little too good when you got multiples onto the battlefield at the same time, so the easy solution to prevent that was to make the card legendary. The lead developer of the set, Randy Buehler, came and asked me if I was okay with that change, and I said I was. When the card got flavored, they decided to reference a goblin that the goblin clan of the set was named after, a goblin named Krark. (The goblin clan was the Krark-clan.) They ended up making it  Krark&#39;s Thumb because that was the silliest name they could come up with. The card was designed for a very casual crowd, so we felt the sillier the name, the better.</p><p>    成本从原来的一分为二，模板得到了清理，使它们变得传奇。后者之所以发生，是因为当您同时将多个倍数放进战场时，这张牌的效果太好了，因此防止这种情况的简单解决方案就是让这张牌具有传奇色彩。布景的首席开发商兰迪·布勒（Randy Buehler）来问我是否可以接受这种更改，我说是。当卡片变味后，他们决定参考一个妖精，该妖精以该套装的妖精氏族命名。 （地精氏族是Krark氏族。）他们最终把它称为Krark's Thumb，因为那是他们能想到的最愚蠢的名字。该卡是为非常休闲的人群设计的，因此我们觉得这个名字越傻越好。</p><p>   Flash forward many years to the design of  Unstable. Rolling a die played a major role in the set, and I was looking for a card that would encourage you to play die-roll cards together. It dawned on me that I could use the same design I did for coin flipping, just for dice. The playtest name was  Krark&#39;s Other Thumb because that just felt like a funny name for it. The name stuck, and we never changed it. (How Krark&#39;s other thumb got to Bablovia is a story for another day.)</p><p>   快闪了很多年，直到不稳定的设计。掷骰子在游戏中起主要作用，我一直在寻找一张鼓励您一起玩掷骰子纸牌的纸牌。我突然意识到，我可以使用与掷硬币一样的设计，仅用于骰子。游戏测试的名称是Krark's Other Thumb，因为那听起来像是一个有趣的名字。名字卡住了，我们再也没有改变。 （克拉克的另一个拇指是如何到达巴勃罗维亚的，这是另一回事了。） </p><p> After  Unstable came out, it became a running joke in The Pit that we needed to make a card called Krark, the Thumbless. When designing legendary creatures for  Commander Legends, the design team decided why not? Obviously, it wanted to play well with his thumbs. As die rolling is an  Un- thing and  Commander Legends was a black-bordered product, the card focused on coin flipping. I believe they tied it into spell casting to work with other themes in the set. I do want to note that the card&#39;s flavor text is a callback to the flavor text of  Krark&#39;s Other Thumb.</p><p>不稳定出现后，这变成了《坑》中的笑话，我们需要制作一张名为Krark（无指）的卡。在为Commander Legends设计传奇生物时，设计团队决定为什么不这样做？显然，它想用他的拇指打好。由于滚装是一回事，而《 Commander Legends》则是黑边产品，因此该卡专注于硬币翻转。我相信他们将其捆绑成咒语以配合场景中的其他主题。我确实要注意，卡片的样式文本是对Krark的“ Other Thumb”样式文本的回调。</p><p>    Hal and Alena are trackers who live in the Ulvenwald on the plane of Innistrad. Alena first shows up on one piece of flavor text in  Dark Ascension, the second set in original  Innistrad block. Oftentimes, flavor text writers will invent characters to create a perspective to see the world through. I believe Alena was created to be an on-the-ground person for green cards.</p><p>    哈尔（Hal）和艾琳娜（Alena）是住在因尼斯拉德（Innistrad）飞机上的Ulvenwald的跟踪者。 Alena首先在Dark Ascension中显示了一个风味文字，第二组在原始Innistrad块中显示。通常，风味文字作者会发明角色来创造透视世界的视角。我相信Alena的创建是为了获得绿卡。</p><p>   In  Avacyn Restored, the last set in the block, we learn that Alena has a partner named Halana. The two show up in the flavor text of three more cards.</p><p>   在该块中的最后一个集合“ Avacyn Restored”中，我们了解到Alena有一个名为Halana的伙伴。在另外三张卡片的样式文字中显示了两个。</p><p>     At this point, they&#39;re still pretty minor characters, and this was back in the day where we made a lot less legendary creatures, so we never really considered making cards out of them at the time.</p><p>     在这一点上，它们仍然是相当次要的角色，而那是在我们减少传奇生物的年代，所以我们从来没有真正考虑过用它们制作卡片。</p><p> Flash forward to the next return to Innistrad in  Shadows over Innistrad. Kimberly Kreines is writing a story about werewolves and realizes that Hal and Alena would make great protagonists for the story (&#34; Under the Silver Moon&#34;). Kimberly then reuses them for a second story (&#34; Emrakul Rises&#34;). As they get more exposure, they start to pick up fans.  Magic fans like to see characters they care about show up on cards, especially legendary creature cards representing the characters. The problem was that the stories get written much later in the process and we&#39;d missed the window to make cards of Hal and Alena in  Shadows over Innistrad or  Eldritch Moon, but we realized there was a lot of desire to see them printed as cards.</p><p> 向前飞到下一次在因尼斯特拉德（Innistrad）阴影中回到因尼斯特拉德的时间。金伯利·克莱因斯（Kimberly Kreines）正在写一个有关狼人的故事，并意识到哈尔和艾琳娜将成为该故事的主角（《银月之下》）。然后，金伯利将它们重新用于第二个故事（＆＃34; Emrakul Rises＆＃34;）。随着他们获得更多的曝光率，他们开始吸引粉丝。魔术迷喜欢看到他们关心的角色出现在卡片上，尤其是代表角色的传奇生物卡片。问题是故事在过程中被写得很晚，我们错过了在因尼斯拉德（Inistradr）或埃尔德里奇·月亮（Eldritch Moon）上的《暗影》中制作哈尔（Hal）和艾琳娜（Alena）卡的窗口，但是我们意识到有很多希望看到它们印刷作为卡片。</p><p> Commander Legends has space to print them  and the partner mechanic, which seemed like a thematic slam dunk for the duo. The two cards were designed such that they each cared about large creatures in a different way to make them a fun pair to play together as commanders. And that is why it took such a long time to finally get Hal and Alena into card form.</p><p> 传奇突击队有足够的空间来打印它们和合作伙伴的机械手，这看起来像是二人组的主题灌篮。这两张牌的设计使得它们各自以不同的方式关心大型生物，从而使它们成为有趣的一对，可以作为指挥官一起玩。这就是为什么花了很长时间才最终使Hal和Alena成为卡片形式的原因。</p><p>        Kamahl was a pit fighter who was known for using red magic. (Pit fighters were people who fought while people spectated.) We ended up making him a 6/1 haste creature that could tap to  Lightning Bolt. Kamahl had a sister named Jeska. She got a legendary creature card in  Judgment. During the  Odyssey story, under the influence of a power artifact called the  Mirari, Kamahl seriously injured Jeska with his sword.</p><p>        卡玛尔（Kamahl）是一名使用红色魔法而闻名的斗士。 （坑战士是在人们旁观的情况下战斗的人。）我们最终使他成为6/1的急速生物，可以使用闪电箭。卡玛尔有一个姐姐叫杰斯卡（Jeska）。她在审判中得到了一张传奇生物卡。在《奥德赛》的故事中，在一个叫做Mirari的强力神器的影响下，Kamahl用剑重伤了Jeska。 </p><p> Kamahl was also the protagonist of the  Onslaught block, but he had gone through a fundamental change by the end of the  Odyssey story. He had given up being a pit fighter and become a druid.</p><p>卡玛尔还是《猛攻》街区的主角，但他在《奥德赛》故事的结尾经历了根本性的改变。他放弃了成为斗士，成为了德鲁伊。</p><p>   We represented this change by making a new Kamahl card, this time in green rather than red. To show that Kamahl was now bonding with the land, we gave him an ability that could animate lands and another that could pump creatures. The earliest version of this card, by the way, had the text &#34;All land creatures you control get +2/+2&#34; and was called Kamahl, Land Lord.</p><p>   我们通过制作一张新的Kamahl卡来代表这一变化，这次是绿色而不是红色。为了表明卡马尔现在正在与大地建立联系，我们给了他一种可以为大地赋予生命的能力，而另一种可以为生物提供能量的能力。顺便说一句，这张卡的最早版本的文字是＆＃34;您控制的所有陆地生物得+ 2 / + 2＆＃34;被称为土地领主卡玛尔</p><p> The  Onslaught block story introduced a new antagonist for Kamahl, a man named Ixidor who had the power to dream things into existence. One of the things he dreamt into existence was a powerful and beautiful angel named Akroma. Also, Jeska was saved from her injury, but it ended up transforming her into a woman with a poisonous touch. She renamed herself Phage. In  Legions, the second set in the  Onslaught block, we made cards of both Akroma and Phage.</p><p> 突袭事件的故事为卡玛尔介绍了一个新的对手，他是一个名叫艾克西多（Ixidor）的人，他有能力使事物成真。他梦into以求的存在之一就是一个强大而美丽的天使，名为阿克罗马（Akroma）。同样，耶斯卡（Jeska）从受伤中获救，但最终使她变成了一个有毒的女人。她将自己重命名为噬菌体。在《军团》（《猛攻》区域的第二盘）中，我们制作了Akroma和Phage的卡片。</p><p>    A few months earlier, I&#39;d designed a creature that killed any player it dealt damage to. I wasn&#39;t sure what to do with the design, so I put it aside waiting for the right spot to use it. It ended up being a perfect fit for Phage. Akroma&#39;s design was a lot more contentious. The Creative team and I were trying to design a card that matched the story. Because she was a dream, Akroma couldn&#39;t die, so the conflict was between a woman with a death touch and a woman that couldn&#39;t be killed. I designed a version of Akroma that returned to the battlefield whenever it died, but Bill Rose was much more interested in a creature that just appeared very powerful. We ended up making what R&amp;D refers to as a &#34;kitchen sink&#34; design where the creature just has a lot of keywords. (If you want to hear more about the making of Akroma, I wrote a whole article about it called &#34; Angels Among Us&#34; for an Akroma-themed week on the website—I&#39;ll get to the theme week in a second). Both Akroma and Phage turned out to be very popular cards.</p><p>    几个月前，我设计了一种杀死任何对其造成伤害的玩家的生物。我不确定如何处理设计，因此将其放在一边等待正确的位置使用它。最终它非常适合噬菌体。 Akroma的设计更具争议性。我和创意团队正在尝试设计与故事相符的卡片。由于阿克罗马（Akroma）是一个梦，她无法死，所以冲突发生在有死亡感的女人和无法杀死的女人之间。我设计了一个版本的Akroma，每当它死后便会返回战场，但是Bill Rose对这个看起来非常强大的生物更感兴趣。我们最终进行了R＆amp; D所指的“厨房水槽”。设计该生物只有很多关键词的地方。 （（如果您想了解有关Akroma制作的更多信息，我在网站上撰写了整篇名为《我们之间的天使》的文章-我将以主题为主题一周内）。事实证明，Akroma和Phage都非常受欢迎。</p><p>   In the last part of the story, in  Scourge, Akroma, Phage, and a third character named Zagorka get combined into a new character named  Karona, False God. I believe Brian Tinsman designed this card trying to make something novel and strange. It wasn&#39;t a very popular card though and didn&#39;t serve as a great follow-up to Akroma and Phage. (One of these days we really should make a better Karona design.)</p><p>   在故事的最后部分，在天灾中，阿克罗马，噬菌和第三个角色Zagorka被组合成一个新角色，即假神卡罗娜。我相信Brian Tinsman设计了这张卡片，试图使某些东西变得新颖而奇怪。不过，它并不是很受欢迎的卡片，也不能作为Akroma和Phage的重要后续产品。 （这些日子之一，我们确实应该做出更好的Karona设计。）</p><p> Flash forward a number of years to the  Ravnica block. The  Magic website used to do theme weeks every other week, and I was interested in doing something that had some audience involvement. We chose what we thought were the 64 most popular legendary creature cards and had them fight off in a giant head-to-head voting battle. The winner after 63 days of voting was Akroma. We&#39;d promised that the winner of the event would get a theme week dedicated to them. (That&#39;s why I wrote the Akroma article I mentioned above.)</p><p> 快闪几年到Ravnica街区。 Magic网站过去每隔一周会做一次主题活动，而我对做一些吸引观众的事情感兴趣。我们选择了我们认为是64种最受欢迎​​的传奇生物卡牌，并让它们在一场巨大的头对头投票大战中战斗。经过63天的投票，获胜者是Akroma。我们承诺，活动的获胜者将获得一个主题周，专门针对他们。 （这就是为什么我写上面提到的Akroma文章的原因。）</p><p>    Around the same time, we were working on  Time Spiral design, which had a bonus sheet. Since Akroma had won, we decided to include her on the bonus sheet. Then, in  Planar Chaos, we were making alternative versions of characters from the past, so we decided to make a mono-red version of her (she was named Akroma of Wrath after all). The trick was differentiating her from the mono-white version, so we found ourselves in the weird space of not wanting to use haste on a red creature. We felt she needed to carry over flying and trample and gave her two new protections from color. To help her feel red, we gave her firebreathing and &#34;can&#39;t be countered.&#34; Then to adjust for not having haste, we gave her morph so she could attack the turn you first see it&#39;s Akroma.</p><p>    大约在同一时间，我们正在研究时间螺旋设计，该设计具有奖金表。由于Akroma获胜，我们决定将她包括在奖金表中。然后，在《混乱的星球》中，我们制作了过去角色的替代版本，因此我们决定制作她的单红色版本（毕竟她被命名为愤怒的阿克罗马玛）。诀窍是将她与单色版区别开来，因此我们发现自己处在一个怪异的空间，不想对红色生物匆忙使用。我们觉得她需要继续飞行和践踏，并给了她两个新的颜色保护。为了帮助她感到红色，我们给她吐了口气，并且不能阻止她。然后为了不急于调整，我们给了她一个变身，以便她可以攻击到您首先看到它的Akroma的回合。 </p><p> We decided we wanted to finish off an Akroma cycle with  Future Sight but weren&#39;t sure how to do it in a way that felt like the future. Our solution was to make it a memorial to Akroma to stress that she was gone, but not forgotten. The artifact gave all the abilities from her original design to all your creatures.</p><p>我们决定要使用Future Sight结束Akroma周期，但不确定如何以一种感觉像未来的方式来完成它。我们的解决方案是将其纪念为Akroma，以强调她已去世但未被遗忘。这件神器将她原始设计的所有能力赋予了您所有的生物。</p><p> Which brings us to  Commander Legends. We decided that we wanted to bring all three characters back. For Akroma, we went back to her original card and tweaked it to be a little better as a commander. She still had flying, first strike, vigilance, and trample (but no haste or protection) and pumped your creatures based on their evergreen keywords (plus partner) that they had. The more keywords, the more she pumped them.</p><p> 这使我们进入了《传奇指挥官》。我们决定要把所有三个字符都带回来。对于阿克罗马（Akroma），我们回到了她原来的名片上，并对其进行了调整，使其作为指挥官更好一些。她仍然有飞行，第一击，警惕和践踏（但没有急速或保护）的感觉，并且根据他们拥有的常绿关键字（加上伙伴）来抽出您的生物。关键字越多，她吸引的次数就越多。</p><p> Kamahl was just a tweak of his last printed version,  Kamahl, Fist of Krosa. He could still animate lands but also grant them vigilance, indestructible, and haste. Vigilance so you could still use them for mana, indestructible so you&#39;re not afraid to attack with them, and haste so you didn&#39;t have to remember which specific land you played this turn. Kamahl still grants +3/+3 and trample to your team, but now as a triggered effect rather than an activated one. This overall package was a bit stronger than the previous version, so we raised his mana cost from 4GG to 6GG.</p><p> Kamahl只是他最后印刷版本Krosa拳头Kamahl的一项改进。他仍然可以为土地设置动画，但也可以使他们保持警惕，坚不可摧且匆忙。保持警惕，以便您仍然可以将它们用作法力，坚不可摧，因此您不惧怕与他们一起攻击，并且可以草率行事，因此您不必记住本回合中您打过哪个特定区域。卡玛尔仍然为您的团队提供+ 3 / + 3并践踏，但现在是触发效果而不是激活效果。这个整体包比以前的版本强一点，所以我们将他的魔法消耗从4GG提升到6GG。</p><p> Jeska was the most complicated design, as we&#39;d never made a straight-up Jeska planeswalker card before (she had been a legendary creature as herself, as Phage, and as part of  Karona, False God). In the story, Jeska became a Planeswalker, so we thought it would be cool to make her one of the two planeswalker cards in the set. They were both planned to be playable as commanders, so that was a given from the start. Her name, Jeska, Thrice Reborn came from the epithet she got in the story (she died and became Phage, then died again and become Karona, and then died again and went back to being Jeska, but now a Planeswalker). We gave her a static ability that interacted with the playing of commanders. Her two loyalty abilities both played around with the &#34;thrice&#34; in her name, connecting effects to the number three. As she was mono-red, both effects were connected to damage.</p><p> 耶斯卡（Jeska）是最复杂的设计，因为我们之前从未制作过整齐的耶斯卡（Jeska）鹏洛客卡（她本身就是一个传奇生物，作为噬菌体以及作为假神卡罗纳（Karona）的一部分）。在故事中，杰斯卡（Jeska）成为了鹏洛客（Planeswalker），所以我们认为将她设为集合中的两张鹏洛客牌之一很酷。他们俩都计划扮演指挥官的角色，所以从一开始就是这样。她的名字叫Jeska，Thrice Reborn来自故事中她得到的绰号（她去世了，成为了噬菌体，然后又去世了，成为了Karona，然后又去世了，又回到了Jeska，但现在是一个鹏洛客。）我们赋予了她与指挥官的互动互动的静态能力。她的两种忠诚度功能都与“三次”游戏有关。以她的名字，将效果连接到第三位。由于她是单红的，所以两种影响都与伤害有关。</p><p>   That&#39;s all the time I have for today. I hope you enjoyed this peek into some of the characters from the past that we made into legendary creatures (and planeswalkers) in  Commander Legends. As always, I&#39;m eager to hear any feedback you all might have on today&#39;s column or any of the cards I talked about, or  Commander Legends as a product, either through  email or through any of my social media accounts ( Twitter,  Tumblr,  Instagram, and  TikTok).</p><p>   这就是我今天所有的时间。我希望您喜欢这个窥视过去的角色，这些角色是我们在《 Commander Legends》中成为传奇生物（和鹏洛客的）的一部分。和往常一样，我很想通过电子邮件或任何社交媒体听到大家对今天的专栏或我所谈论的任何卡片或Commander Legend作为产品的任何反馈帐户（Twitter，Tumblr，Instagram和TikTok）。</p><p>  Until then, may you have as much fun playing with the characters as we had making them.</p><p>  在那之前，也许您会像我们制作角色一样开心。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/quite-some-characters-2020-11-09">https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/quite-some-characters-2020-11-09</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/文字/">#文字</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/flavor/">#flavor</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
