After a hasty search, Marcel found him at the bottom of a shallow pit. When Marcel jumped down to rescue the frightened dog, however, he noticed a small, very deep hole. His heart leapt. Legend had it that a secret tunnel leading to a nearby chateau was hidden somewhere around there – and he felt sure this was it. Four days later, he came back to explore with three friends. Squeezing through the narrow opening, they gingerly worked their way down a 15m shaft, until they found themselves standing in an enormous cave. At first, they struggled to see much by the pale light of their oil lamp. All of a sudden, one of them gave a cry and pointed at the wall. To their amazement, ranged along the length of the cavern was a vast cavalcade of animals, painted in the most vivid colours.</p><p>1940年9月8日，马塞尔·拉维达（Marcel Ravidat）在蒙蒂尼亚克（Montignac）家附近的树林中漫步时，他的狗机器人（Robot）突然失踪了。匆忙搜寻后，马塞尔（Marcel）在浅坑底部找到了他。但是，当马塞尔（Marcel）跳下营救那只受惊的狗时，他注意到了一个很小的深洞。他的心跳了起来。传说有一条通往附近城堡的秘密隧道被藏在附近的某个地方，他确信这就是事实。四天后，他回来与三个朋友一起探索。他们从狭窄的开口中挤出来，小心翼翼地沿着15m的井道前进，直到发现自己站在一个巨大的洞穴中。起初，他们努力地通过油灯的淡色看到很多东西。突然，其中一个人哭了起来，指着墙。令他们惊讶的是，沿着洞穴的长度分布着大量的动物，它们被涂上了最鲜艳的色彩。</p><p> The Lascaux cave paintings, as they would soon be known, proved to be one of the most extensive and complete examples of Palaeolithic art in Europe, if not the world. Now dated to c.15000 BC they comprise a dazzling assortment of images, including some 6,000 representations of animals. Though painted by several different social groups, they are remarkable for the technical sophistication with which they were rendered. A range of pigments was used, including red hematite, yellow goethite, and black manganese. These were mixed with a binding agent, such as animal fat, clay, or water, to produce a rudimentary paint, or ground into a powder and ‘spat’ or blown onto the wall through a reindeer bone. Some of the paintings are so high that they can only have been reached using a specially built scaffold; while to produce others, the artists would have had to clamber down into a ‘well’.</p><p> 人们很快就会知道，Lascaux洞穴壁画被证明是欧洲甚至世界上最古老和完整的旧石器时代艺术品之一。现在可以追溯到公元前15000年，其中包含令人眼花images乱的图像，其中包括大约6,000种动物的图像。尽管由几个不同的社会群体绘画，但它们在渲染技术上却十分出色。使用了多种颜料，包括红色赤铁矿，黄色针铁矿和黑色锰。将它们与粘合剂（例如动物脂肪，粘土或水）混合，制成基本的油漆，或磨成粉末，然后通过驯鹿骨头“点”或吹到墙壁上。有些绘画太高了，以至于只能用特制的脚手架才能达到。在创作其他作品时，艺术家们不得不攀登成一个“井”。</p><p> A number of different animals are depicted, including stags, ibex, bison, aurochs (an extinct species of wild cattle), felines, a bear, a bird and even a rhinoceros. But by far the most common are horses. Unlike other creatures, which tend to be concentrated in certain places, horses are everywhere – and in huge numbers. By one estimate, they account for no less than 60 per cent of all identifiable animals in the Lascaux complex.</p><p> 描绘了许多不同的动物，包括雄鹿，高地山羊，野牛，野牛（野牛的灭绝物种），猫科动物，熊，鸟甚至犀牛。但是到目前为止，最常见的是马。与倾向于集中在某些地方的其他生物不同，马无处不在-数量众多。据一项估计，它们占拉斯科地区所有可识别动物的不少于60％。</p><p> What is most striking about these horses is the intimate, even affectionate, familiarity with which they are portrayed. With their stocky build, short legs and spiky mane, they look similar to Przewalski’s horse, still found in Mongolia today. Though they are shown in a variety of different shades and patterns, most appear in their ‘mating’ coats, with dun-coloured hair and occasionally a pale or dappled underside. Some are standing, others are walking. More often than not, they are galloping – racing across the grasslands of prehistoric France, or fleeing an unseen foe.</p><p> 这些马匹最令人印象深刻的是他们对马匹的亲密，甚至亲切，熟悉。它们的身材矮胖，短腿和尖锐的鬃毛，看上去与今天仍在蒙古发现的普氏原羚的马相似。尽管它们以各种不同的阴影和图案显示，但大多数都以“交配”的外套出现，头发呈浅褐色，底面偶尔呈浅色或斑驳。有些人站立，有些人步行。它们经常在疾驰-在史前法国的草原上竞速，或者逃脱看不见的敌人。</p><p>  The frequency with which they appear is puzzling, though. After all, horses were not domesticated until at least 10,000 years afterwards; and, though earlier cultures are known to have relied on them for both meat and hides, the same cannot be said for the communities which inhabited Lascaux. On the basis of bones found in the caves, it appears that reindeer were by far the most important source of food. Horses, by contrast, seem to have been rarely on the menu.</p><p>  但是，它们出现的频率令人困惑。毕竟，直到至少一万年前，马才被驯养。而且，尽管众所周知，早期的文化既依赖肉类和生皮，也不能对居住在拉斯科的社区说同样的话。根据洞穴中发现的骨头，看来驯鹿是迄今为止最重要的食物来源。相比之下，马似乎很少出现在菜单上。</p><p>   To answer this question, we first have to ask what purpose Palaeolithic cave paintings were meant to serve. This is a thorny problem, however. In the absence of any texts, which might give us a clear impression of the artists’ visual culture, belief system and relationship with the natural world, it is difficult to say anything about how the Lascaux cave paintings were meant to be understood, let alone why horses played such an important role in them. So difficult is it, in fact, that some archaeologists have questioned whether anything meaningful can be said about their function at all. According to Paul Bahn, it is a dubious enterprise at best. ‘If the artist’s testimony is unavailable’, he has argued, ‘the interpretation of the content of rock art is largely speculation, and to pretend otherwise is dishonest or an illusion.’ Others, however, are not so pessimistic. Emmanuel Anati, for example, has pointed out that, since Palaeolithic people were presumably able to understand the Lascaux cave paintings without recourse to anything beyond their own experience, we should be able to as well; it is just a matter of ‘getting into the right state of mind’.</p><p>   要回答这个问题，我们首先要问旧石器时代的岩画有什么用。但是，这是一个棘手的问题。在没有任何文字的情况下，这可能使我们对艺术家的视觉文化，信仰体系以及与自然世界的关系有清晰的印象，很难说出如何理解Lascaux洞穴壁画，更不用说了为什么马在其中扮演如此重要的角色。实际上，这是如此困难，以至于有些考古学家质疑是否可以就其功能说出任何有意义的事情。根据保罗·巴恩（Paul Bahn）的说法，这充其量是个可疑的企业。他认为，“如果无法提供艺术家的证词”，“对岩石艺术内容的解释主要是猜测，而假装否则是不诚实或幻想的。”然而，其他人并不那么悲观。例如，伊曼纽尔·阿纳提（Emmanuel Anati）指出，由于旧石器时代的人们大概能够理解Lascaux洞穴绘画而无需依靠自己的经验，因此我们也应该能够做到。这只是“进入正确的心理状态”的问题。</p><p> But what is the ‘right state of mind’? And how should we ‘get into’ it?</p><p> 但是什么是“正确的心态”？而我们应该如何“融入”呢？ </p><p>  One of the earliest attempts to grapple with this problem was made by Abbé Henri Breuil. A pioneering scholar of Palaeolithic art, he was the first to study the Lascaux site systematically. In his view, the paintings could best be understood by analogy. Recognising that they had arisen from the daily experiences of a society that depended on hunting for its survival, he sought to explain their purpose by looking at how apparently similar cultures used such images in his own day. As an example, he chose the Arrernte people of central Australia. Though not alike in all respects, they, too, were hunter-gatherers, who frequently depicted animals in their rock art; and, since they viewed images as a form of ‘sympathetic magic’, Breuil assumed that the Lascaux painters had done the same.</p><p>解决这个问题的最早尝试之一是AbbéHenri Breuil。他是旧石器时代艺术的先驱学者，是第一个系统地研究Lascaux遗址的人。在他看来，最好通过类比来理解这些画作。他认识到它们源于一个依靠狩猎谋生的社会的日常经验，因此他试图通过观察在自己的时代中类似文化如何使用此类图像来解释它们的目的。例如，他选择了澳大利亚中部的Arrernte人。尽管在各个方面都不尽相同，但他们还是狩猎采集者，他们经常在岩石艺术中描绘动物。并且，由于他们将图像视为一种“同情魔术”的形式，因此布劳伊尔认为拉斯科的画家也是如此。</p><p> The way it worked was simple. For Palaeolithic societies, Breuil argued, an image was  the animal it represented – to such an extent that whatever happened on a cave wall would magically happen in real life. This was particularly true of the Lascaux horses. By painting pictures of horses being pierced by spears, Breuil claimed, the artists were ensuring the success of the next hunt. And in showing them in great herds, often in their mating coats, the hunters were willing there to be a plentiful supply of potential prey.</p><p> 它的工作方式很简单。布劳伊认为，对于旧石器时代的社会来说，图像就是它所代表的动物，其程度使得在洞穴壁上发生的任何事情都将在现实生活中神奇地发生。拉斯科的马尤其如此。布劳伊尔说，通过画出被长矛刺穿的马的照片，艺术家们确保了下一次狩猎的成功。并且，在向他们展示大群人，通常是穿着大衣时，猎人们愿意提供大量的潜在猎物。</p><p>  There were, however, two fundamental problems with this. On the one hand, Breuil’s comparison between the Arrernte and the Lascaux peoples seems dubious at best. While there may be a few superficial similarities between the two, it is difficult to believe that the practices of a modern Australian society share all that much in common with a Palaeolithic culture on the other side of the world. On the other hand, Breuil’s ideas about ‘sympathetic magic’ are difficult to reconcile with what we know about the animals depicted at Lascaux. As we have already seen, horses were simply not an important enough part of the creators’ diet to merit such ‘magical’ attention; while other animals, far from being prey, were positively dangerous. In one scene, a man is actually being killed by a bison – hardly the fate anyone would want to conjure up!</p><p>  但是，这有两个基本问题。一方面，布劳伊对阿伦特人和拉斯科人的比较充其量似乎令人怀疑。尽管两者之间可能有一些表面上的相似之处，但很难相信现代澳大利亚社会的做法与世界另一端的旧石器时代文化有着许多共同点。另一方面，布劳伊关于“同情魔术”的观点很难与我们对拉斯科所描绘的动物的了解相吻合。正如我们已经看到的那样，马在创造者的饮食中根本不足以值得这种“神奇”的关注。而其他动物远非猎物，却具有积极危险。在一个场景中，一个人实际上是被野牛杀死的-几乎没人会想像这种命运！</p><p>  In the 1950s and 1960s, an alternative approach was proposed by Andrei Leroi-Gourhan and Annette Laming-Emperaire. In the belief that the cave paintings were a superficial expression of the deeper structures of thought characteristic of the society which created them, Leroi-Gourhan and Laming Emperaire attempted to look for hidden ‘patterns’ in the caverns and to attribute meaning to the distribution of abstract symbols and animal forms. On this basis, they suggested the cave could be read as the reflection of a spiritual world view based on the contrast between male and female. Thus, dots, dashes, bison and auroch were ‘masculine’ and ovals, squares, triangles and horses were ‘feminine’. That horses were shown in their ‘mating’ coats was hence testimony to a powerful association between women and fecundity; while the frequency of their appearance was probably due to the importance of reproduction and nurturing to an increasingly settled, if still vulnerable, society.</p><p>  在1950年代和1960年代，Andrei Leroi-Gourhan和Annette Laming-Emperaire提出了另一种方法。 Leroi-Gourhan和Laming Emperaire相信洞穴壁画是社会更深层次思想特征的表面表达，因此他们试图在洞穴中寻找隐藏的“图案”，并赋予洞穴壁画以意义。抽象符号和动物形式。在此基础上，他们认为该洞穴可以理解为基于男性和女性之间对比的精神世界观的反映。因此，点，破折号，野牛和野牛为“男性”，椭圆，正方形，三角形和马为“女性”。因此，在“交配”的大衣中展示了马匹，就证明了妇女与生殖力之间有很强的联系。它们出现的频率很可能是由于繁殖和养育对日益稳定的，甚至仍然是脆弱的社会的重要性。</p><p> The sheer arbitrariness of the approach was, however, difficult to overlook. In the 1990s, therefore, a third interpretation was put forward by the South African archaeologist, David Lewis-Williams. This returned to the idea that the paintings might have had some magical qualities. In a ‘New Age’ twist, however, it was based as much on neurology as on analogy.</p><p> 但是，这种方法的绝对任意性很难忽略。因此，在1990年代，南非考古学家David Lewis-Williams提出了第三种解释。这又回到了画作可能具有某种神奇品质的观念。然而，在“新时代”的转折中，它既基于神经病又基于类推。</p><p> For Lewis-Williams, the key to the cave’s purpose lay in the abstract symbols. Noting that they were common to Palaeolithic art, he postulated that they were ‘form constants’ – geometric patterns commonly seen by people in a state of sensory deprivation or during drug-induced hallucinations. Since similar form constants commonly appear in images made by shamans – who often enter trance-like states for ritual purposes – he concluded that the Lascaux artists were likely to have been shamans, too. This suggested that the paintings were a record of the visual phenomena experienced during ceremonial ‘voyages’ to a spirit world – and that the animals represented the shadowy entities with which they sought to commune in the hope of healing sickness, changing the weather, or securing food. In this reading, horses would appear as a particularly important spirit, albeit one whose significance remains obscure.</p><p> 对于Lewis-Williams而言，洞穴目的的关键在于抽象符号。他指出它们是旧石器时代艺术的共同点，他假定它们是“形式常数”，即处于感觉剥夺状态或在药物引起的幻觉中人们经常看到的几何图案。由于类似的形式常数通常出现在萨满巫师制作的图像中，而萨满巫师通常出于礼仪目的进入states状态，因此他得出​​结论说，拉斯科艺术家也可能是萨满巫师。这表明这些画作是对在精神世界进行礼仪“航行”时所经历的视觉现象的记录，而这些动物则代表了他们想要与之交流的阴影实体，以期治愈疾病，改变天气或确保安全。餐饮。在这种阅读中，尽管马的意义仍然晦涩难懂，但马会显得特别重要。</p><p>  Ingenious though it may be, however, Lewis-Williams’ ‘neurological’ approach is no more compelling than the others. Indeed, it actually combines the weaknesses of both. Not only is it wildly – even recklessly – conjectural, but the assumption of a common form of shamanism across millennia and continents seems untenable.</p><p>  刘易斯-威廉姆斯（Lewis-Williams）的“神经病学”方法虽然独具匠心，但并不比其他方法更具吸引力。实际上，它实际上结合了两者的弱点。这不仅是疯狂的，甚至是鲁re的猜想，而且在整个千年和各大洲普遍采用萨满教形式的假设似乎站不住脚。 </p><p>  So where does this leave the horse? After decades of trying to read  into the Lascaux paintings, archaeologists have recently begun looking  around them – that is to say, at the caves. When confronted by the scale of the images, it is sometimes easy to forget that these were spaces occupied not only by artists, but also by reasonably large communities. They served as a site for butchering, eating, finding partners, raising children, recovering, remembering, learning and even teaching. And maybe this is all we really need to know. Imagine, for a moment, a Palaeolithic group seeking shelter in the cave after the hunt, huddling round the fire to discuss the day’s events, to share their hopes and fears, to try new things out, or to prepare their young for trials to come. What could have been more natural than to illustrate their talk with pictures – and to share in the making?</p><p>那这匹马在哪里呢？经过数十年尝试阅读Lascaux画作之后，考古学家最近开始在四周寻找它们-也就是说，在洞穴中。当面对图像的比例时，有时容易忘记这些空间不仅是艺术家，而且是相当大的社区所占据的空间。他们是屠宰，饮食，寻找伴侣，抚养孩子，康复，记忆，学习甚至教学的场所。也许这就是我们真正需要知道的。想象一下，一个旧石器时代的团体在狩猎后寻求在山洞中的庇护所，缩在火堆旁讨论当天的事件，分享他们的希望和恐惧，尝试新事物，或准备他们的年轻人为即将来临的审判做准备。还有什么比用图片来说明他们的谈话并分享创作更自然的呢？</p><p> If such was their purpose, it would explain much about their visual choices. It would explain why they would have given so little space to animals like the reindeer, which they could already kill with ease, yet so much to those like the bison, which threatened them. It could also provide a reason for the presence of handprints, spear-like images and other geometrical shapes. But most importantly, it would account for the fascination with horses. Given that horses are known to have been killed, but only rarely and with difficulty, it is easy to see why their abundance, speed and mating season might have exercised such a potent hold over the imagination. Having seen herds galloping across the plains, how could these people not have longed to catch them? How could they not have marvelled at their swiftness and strength? Perhaps, by painting them, they were teaching, hoping, yearning. Perhaps they, like Peter Shaffer’s  Equus, were simply crying out in love and defiance: ‘I am yours and you are mine.’</p><p> 如果这是他们的目的，它将为他们的视觉选择做出很多解释。这将解释为什么它们只给驯鹿这样的动物以很少的空间，而它们已经可以轻松杀死，而对像野牛这样威胁它们的动物却给予了如此之多的空间。这也可能提供出现手印，矛状图像和其他几何形状的原因。但最重要的是，这将说明对马的迷恋。鉴于已知已经杀死了马匹，但很少，而且很难，因此很容易看出为什么它们的丰度，速度和交配季节可能会发挥如此强大的作用。看到牛群在平原上疾驰，这些人又怎会不愿意捉住它们？他们怎能不对他们的敏捷和力量感到惊奇？也许通过绘画他们，他们在教书，希望，向往。也许他们像彼得·谢弗（Peter Shaffer）的《马属》（Equus）一样，只是在爱与反抗中大喊：“我是你的，你是我的。”</p><p>  Alexander Lee is a fellow in the Centre for the Study of the Renaissance at the University of Warwick.
