This money-spinning national love affair with betting owes much to the liberalisation of gambling laws under Tony Blair’s Labour government in 2005. The growth of the UK betting sector since then has created billionaires, such as Bet365’s Denise Coates and Betfred’s Done brothers. At the other end of the scale, what starts out as a harmless flutter has driven countless customers into financial ruin, family breakups, and worse.</p><p>每年，英国赌客给赌博业造成的损失超过110亿英镑，相当于英国每个男人、女人和孩子将近164英镑。2005年，托尼·布莱尔（Tony Blair）领导的工党政府放宽了赌博法，这在很大程度上归功于人们对赌博的热爱。自那以后，英国博彩业的发展造就了亿万富翁，比如Bet365的丹尼斯·科茨（Denise Coates）和Betfred的唐兄弟（Done brothers）。另一方面，一开始是一种无害的波动，导致无数客户陷入财务困境、家庭破裂，甚至更糟。</p><p> The betting industry promotes its wares predominantly through advertising on TV, social media or via wall-to-wall sponsorship of football clubs. But gambling has always been different from other consumer products. Coca-Cola advertises in the knowledge that you probably already know how it tastes. The occasional memory jog will remind you why you like it, and might lead you to buy more and to choose Coke over Pepsi when you do. Convincing a customer to choose your brand – and remain loyal – is only half the battle with gambling. Betting firms also need to persuade punters that they have a decent shot at winning some money, even though – in the long term at least – they don’t.</p><p>博彩业主要通过电视广告、社交媒体或足球俱乐部的赞助来推广其产品。但赌博一直不同于其他消费品。可口可乐在广告中说，你可能已经知道它的味道了。偶尔的记忆慢跑会提醒你为什么喜欢它，当你喜欢的时候，可能会导致你买更多的可乐，而不是百事可乐。说服客户选择你的品牌——并保持忠诚——只是赌博的一半。博彩公司还需要说服投注者，他们有机会赢得一些钱，尽管——至少从长期来看——他们没有。</p><p>  The illusion of control can be particularly effective among the cohort of people most likely to be problem gamblers: young men</p><p>在最有可能成为问题赌徒的人群中，控制幻觉尤其有效：年轻男性</p><p> The gambling industry could not exist unless the bookmaker or casino had a better grasp of the odds than the punter. That’s the foundation upon which the industry is built, and it’s a bargain that – unless they are completely delusional – the gambler enters into knowingly. They bet believing they might just be the one who can beat the bookie, if not by judgment then by luck.</p><p>赌博业不可能存在，除非博彩公司或赌场比赌客更能把握胜算。这是行业建立的基础，这是一个讨价还价，除非他们完全是妄想的，赌徒是故意进入的。他们相信自己可能就是那个能打败赌徒的人，如果不是靠判断，那就是靠运气。</p><p> For six years, I’ve been reporting on the human damage caused by the gambling industry. I’ve heard the desperation in the voice of someone who has lost hundreds of thousands of pounds in a matter of weeks, and I’ve sat with the parents of young people who had their whole lives ahead of them, until a gambling addiction drove them to suicide.</p><p>六年来，我一直在报道赌博业对人类造成的伤害。我听到过一个在短短几周内瘦了数十万磅的人绝望的声音，我也曾和年轻人的父母坐在一起，他们的一生都在等待着他们，直到赌博成瘾迫使他们自杀。</p><p> Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights</p><p>注册我们的Inside Saturday时事通讯，了解该杂志最大特色的独家幕后制作，以及我们每周的亮点策划列表</p><p> Those affected know the trauma all too well. What is less well widely understood is how gambling companies are able to influence otherwise happy, intelligent and sociable people, causing them to act irrationally, against their own interests . The techniques gambling products use to tap into our psyches are both artful and terrible, marrying simplicity of concept with ingenuity of execution to nudge us towards dark choices.</p><p>受影响的人对创伤非常了解。人们不太了解的是，赌博公司如何影响快乐、聪明和善于社交的人，导致他们做出违背自身利益的非理性行为。赌博产品用来挖掘我们心理的技巧既巧妙又可怕，将简单的概念与巧妙的执行结合在一起，将我们推向黑暗的选择。</p><p>  T he starting point is understanding cognitive bias. Humans are irrational – we misjudge reality based on our flawed perception of it. Our love of football or support of a team convinces us that our gut feeling about a game is more reliable than it is, while our optimism tells us that, even thought the chances of winning a slot machine jackpot are stacked against us, fate may have chosen to upset the odds this time.</p><p>起点是理解认知偏见。人类是非理性的——我们基于对现实有缺陷的认知而错误判断现实。我们对足球的热爱或对一支球队的支持让我们相信，我们对一场比赛的直觉比实际情况更可靠，而我们的乐观告诉我们，即使赢得老虎机头奖的机会对我们不利，但这次命运可能会选择打乱胜算。</p><p> Kim Lund, founder of poker game firm Aftermath Interactive, has made a career out of game design and has seen at first-hand how cold, hard probability defeats the illogical human mind every time – and allows the gambling companies to cash in. “All gambling games are based on psychological triggers that mean they work,” he tells me. “The human brain is incapable of dealing with randomness. We’re obsessed with finding patterns in things because that prevents us from going insane. We want to make sense of things.”</p><p>扑克游戏公司founder Interactive的创始人金·隆德（Kim Lund）以游戏设计为职业，亲眼目睹了冷酷、冷酷的概率每次都能击败不合逻辑的人类思维，并让赌博公司获利。“所有的赌博游戏都是基于心理诱因，这意味着它们有效，”他告诉我。“人脑无法处理随机性。我们痴迷于寻找事物中的模式，因为这可以防止我们发疯。我们想要理解事物。”</p><p>  Unlike many forms of gambling, poker requires a high degree of skill; if your opponent is a bad player, they are unlikely to get the better of you with luck, at least not over time. Dr Philip Newall, a former poker player turned academic psychologist, has been studying dynamics like these for much of his professional life. At the poker table, he enjoyed a degree of success because he played just one type of game – fixed-limit hold ’em – where all bets and raises are fixed at a certain amount. Newall stuck to what he knew and, for the most part, only played against people he could be fairly sure, from telltale signs such as their patterns of play, weren’t professionals.  That background, coupled with his in-depth study of psychology, makes him well placed to explain what the industry knows – and exploits – about how our minds work.</p><p>与许多形式的赌博不同，扑克需要高度的技巧；如果你的对手是一个糟糕的球员，他们不太可能通过运气打败你，至少不会随着时间的推移。菲利普·纽瓦尔博士曾是一名扑克玩家，后来成为了一名学术心理学家。在他的职业生涯中，他一直在研究类似的动力学。在扑克桌上，他获得了一定程度的成功，因为他只玩了一种类型的游戏——固定限额持有——所有赌注和加薪都固定在一定数额。纽厄尔坚持他所知道的，在很大程度上，他只与他可以相当肯定的人对抗，从他们的游戏模式等迹象来看，他们不是专业人士。这一背景，再加上他对心理学的深入研究，使他能够很好地解释这个行业对我们的大脑如何工作的了解和利用。</p><p> Newall used to walk down Walworth Road in London, a high street replete with bookmakers’ shops. He would pass William Hill, Betfred and Ladbrokes, and notice they were all offering similar types of bet that went something like this: “Manchester United to win 3–1 v Burnley and Marcus Rashford to score first.” This very common type of bet is known in the trade as a scorecast. It requires a combination of events to occur at once, in this case the exact score, the winning team and the first goal scorer. As soon as you start combining probabilities of multiple events, the odds lengthen very quickly. This means that a scorecast outcome is pretty unlikely, so the bookmaker can offer what looks like a bargain 15–1, knowing the chances of it happening may be more like 50–1.</p><p>纽厄尔过去常沿着伦敦的沃尔沃思路走，这是一条充满博彩公司的大街。他会超过威廉·希尔、贝特弗雷德和立博，并注意到他们都提供类似类型的赌注，就像这样：“曼联以3-1战胜伯恩利，马库斯·拉什福德以得分第一。”这种非常常见的下注方式在业内被称为记分。它要求同时发生多个事件，在这种情况下是准确的分数、获胜的球队和第一个进球得分者。一旦你开始组合多个事件的概率，几率就会迅速增加。这意味着计分结果是不太可能的，因此收受赌注者可以提供看起来像是15比1的交易，知道它发生的几率可能更像是50比1。</p><p> To the average person in the street, the idea of Marcus Rashford scoring the first goal to help Manchester United to a 3–1 win over Burnley sounds like a pretty plausible scenario. When a gambler thinks about that scorecast bet, they are picturing in their mind’s eye an in-form striker opening the scoring in a routine victory over an inferior team. A standard Saturday afternoon.</p><p>对于普通人来说，马库斯·拉什福德打进第一个进球帮助曼联3-1战胜伯恩利的想法听起来很有可能。当一个赌徒想到那次记分赌注时，他们在脑海中想象着一个状态良好的前锋在常规比赛中战胜了一支劣势球队，打开了比分。一个标准的周六下午。</p><p> But bookmakers are sitting on a mine of information on their historical return from scorecasts, and will have a good idea of the difference between the odds they’re offering and the real odds. They don’t publicise this for obvious reasons. That, in Newall’s words, would be “killing their own action”, giving a disproportionate amount of information to the person on the other side of the bet. In poker, the saying is: “Don’t teach the fish” – fish being bad players you can easily take money from. Instead of teaching the fish, gambling companies try to ensure, through the types of bet they promote most heavily, that as many people opt to gamble their money on more complex probability scenarios, rather than sticking to simpler outcomes.</p><p>但是，博彩公司掌握着他们从记分中获得的历史回报信息，他们会很好地了解他们提供的赔率和实际赔率之间的差异。他们没有公开这一点，原因很明显。用纽厄尔的话来说，这将“扼杀他们自己的行为”，给赌注另一方的人提供不成比例的信息。在扑克游戏中，俗话说：“不要教鱼”——鱼是坏玩家，你可以很容易地从中拿钱。赌博公司不教鱼，而是试图通过他们最大力推广的赌博类型，确保许多人选择在更复杂的概率场景上赌博，而不是坚持简单的结果。</p><p> You feed their sense of confidence and self-worth by designing the product in such a way that you increase the sense of control</p><p>你通过设计产品来增强他们的控制感，从而培养他们的自信和自我价值感</p><p> José Perales is an associate professor in the Mind, Brain and Behaviour Research Centre at the University of Granada in Spain. He has studied the same phenomena as Newall and explains that this is the result of something called the “representativeness heuristic”. He said: “A heuristic is a rule of thumb, something you can use that works pretty well in your daily life, but can convince you to make quite serious mistakes, especially when they’re deliberately exploited, which is the case here.”</p><p>约瑟夫佩雷斯是西班牙格拉纳达大学精神、大脑和行为研究中心的副教授。他研究了与Newall相同的现象，并解释说这是“代表性启发”的结果。他说：“启发式是一种经验法则，你可以在日常生活中很好地使用它，但可以说服你犯相当严重的错误，尤其是当它们被故意利用时，这里就是这种情况。”</p><p> The football match scenario in question is something gamblers can easily envisage happening and that they may even have seen before. It could happen. But the necessary confluence of multiple events means it is actually far less likely than it instinctively feels. There are many other possible outcomes that are just as likely.</p><p>有问题的足球比赛场景是赌徒们很容易想象的事情，他们甚至可能以前见过。这可能会发生。但多个事件的必要合流意味着它实际上远不像它本能地感觉到的那么可能。还有许多其他可能的结果也是同样可能的。</p><p> Gambling companies are getting better and better at targeting this sort of weakness in our mental defences. Newall tracked TV adverts over two World Cups in 2014 and 2018, drawing on data collected by the Guardian data journalist Pamela Duncan. He found that standard home win, draw, away win bets (on the winner of the match) simply disappeared from one tournament to the next. These straightforward, easier-to-understand wagers featured in nearly 8% of adverts at the 2014 tournament, but had dwindled to nothing at the next. By contrast, high odds, complex bets shot up from 4% to nearly 35%. The result? A very lucrative World Cup for the gambling companies. As the odds lengthen, the gambler’s ability to calculate them weakens.</p><p>赌博公司越来越善于针对我们心理防御中的这种弱点。纽瓦尔利用《卫报》数据记者帕梅拉·邓肯收集的数据，追踪了2014年和2018年两届世界杯期间的电视广告。他发现，标准的主场赢、平局、客场赢赌注（对比赛获胜者的赌注）从一场比赛消失到下一场比赛。这些简单易懂的赌注出现在2014年锦标赛上近8%的广告中，但在下一届锦标赛上却减少到了零。相比之下，高赔率、复杂的赌注从4%飙升至近35%。结果如何？对于赌博公司来说，这是一场非常有利可图的世界杯。随着赔率的增加，赌徒计算赔率的能力减弱。</p><p>  T his is an example of how the betting industry benefits from “informational asymmetry”. Online casino operators know everything about you – particularly when they can track your online patterns of play and analyse the data in minute detail. The majority of punters, by contrast, know very little about the company on the other end of the bet.</p><p>这是博彩业如何从“信息不对称”中获益的一个例子。在线赌场运营商对你了如指掌——尤其是当他们可以追踪你的在线游戏模式并对数据进行详细分析时。相比之下，大多数投注者对另一端的公司知之甚少。</p><p> Philip Newall coined the phrase “dark nudges” to describe techniques used by the betting firms. The phrase is a nod to the 2008 book Nudge, by economists Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein. A favourite of former UK prime minister David Cameron, the book draws on psychology and behavioural economics to examine how people in positions of authority can “nudge” others into making decisions that benefit them and society. The idea is that you can drive positive changes without needing to be openly coercive, which might make people resistant. Of course, you can nudge people towards poor choices, too.</p><p>菲利普·纽瓦尔（Philip Newall）创造了“暗推”一词来描述博彩公司使用的技术。这句话是对经济学家理查德·泰勒（Richard Thaler）和卡斯·桑斯坦（Cass Sunstein）2008年出版的《推动》（Nudge）一书的认可。这本书是英国前首相戴维·卡梅伦（David Cameron）的最爱，它利用心理学和行为经济学来研究处于权威地位的人如何“推动”他人做出有利于他们和社会的决策。这个想法是，你可以推动积极的变化，而不需要公开强制，这可能会让人们产生抵触情绪。当然，你也可以推动人们做出糟糕的选择。</p><p>   Nobody will stake money on Liverpool losing 15–0 to Port Vale, because they know this is close to impossible. But in games that are entirely random, players exert no control at all over the success of their bet. Indeed, assuming that the game isn’t rigged, nobody has total authority over the outcome. Gamblers often behave as if they do not understand this. Sociologists have observed dice players throwing softly when they want a low number and hard when they want a high one, for instance. In her 1975 paper The Illusion of Control, Ellen J Langer conducted a series of experiments that showed that our expectations of success in a game of chance vary, depending on factors that do not actually affect the outcome. One of the variables that makes a big difference to how gamblers behave is the introduction of an element of choice. In one of Langer’s experiments, subjects were given lottery tickets with an American football player on them. Some subjects got to choose which player they wanted, others were allocated a ticket at random. On the morning of the draw, everyone was asked how much they would be prepared to sell their ticket for. Those who had chosen their ticket demanded an average of $8.67, while those who had been allocated one at random were prepared to give it up for $1.96.</p><p>没有人会赌利物浦0比15输给淡水河谷港，因为他们知道这几乎是不可能的。但在完全随机的游戏中，玩家完全无法控制赌注的成功。事实上，假设游戏没有被操纵，没有人对结果拥有完全的权威。赌徒经常表现得好像他们不明白这一点。例如，社会学家观察到，掷骰子的人在想要一个较低的数字时掷得比较轻，而在想要一个较高的数字时掷得比较硬。在1975年的论文《控制幻觉》中，艾伦·J·兰格进行了一系列实验，表明我们在一场机会游戏中对成功的期望是不同的，这取决于实际上并不影响结果的因素。对赌徒的行为产生重大影响的一个变量是引入了选择因素。在兰格的一个实验中，受试者得到了带有美式足球运动员的彩票。一些受试者可以选择他们想要的球员，其他人则被随机分配一张票。抽签当天上午，每个人都被问到他们准备卖多少票。那些选择门票的人平均要求8.67美元，而那些随机分配门票的人则准备放弃1.96美元。</p><p> Even though the choice of a ticket had no influence on which one would be the winner, those who had made a conscious decision were significantly less willing to abandon it.</p><p>尽管选择一张彩票对哪张彩票会成为赢家没有影响，但那些有意识地做出决定的人明显不太愿意放弃它。</p><p> Dr Steve Sharman, research fellow in the School of Psychology at the University of East London, is a specialist in gambling psychology. He explains what’s going on: “If you go into a casino and you’re playing roulette, they show the previous outcomes. They might show so-called ‘hot numbers’ or ‘cold numbers’. A hot number is one that has come up a lot recently, while a cold one hasn’t been seen for a while. By displaying them, the casino is inviting you to entertain the idea that previous spins of the roulette wheel have an effect on future spins.” This, explains Sharman, reinforces something called the gambler’s fallacy, or the failure to appreciate the “statistical independence of turns”. “If I’ve had 10 heads in a row, it doesn’t make it more likely that tails will come up next,” he says. “But gamblers don’t think like that.” Indeed, people in general don’t tend to think like that.</p><p>Steve Sharman博士是东伦敦大学心理学学院的研究员，是赌博心理学专家。他解释了发生了什么：“如果你去赌场玩轮盘赌，它们会显示之前的结果。它们可能会显示所谓的‘热门数字’或‘冷数字’。热门数字是最近经常出现的数字，而冷数字已经有一段时间没有出现了。通过展示它们，赌场会邀请你接受以前的轮盘赌的想法。”轮盘赌对未来的旋转有影响。“沙曼解释说，这强化了一种被称为赌徒谬论的东西，或者说没有意识到“轮次的统计独立性”他说：“如果我连续有10个头部，那么接下来出现尾巴的可能性并不大。”但赌徒不会这么想。“事实上，人们一般不会这样想。</p><p> It’s a random-number generator. Whether you stop the spin or let the computer do it makes no difference. But it feels as if it does</p><p>这是一个随机数发生器。不管你是停止旋转还是让电脑来做，都没有区别。但感觉好像是的</p><p> I came across hot numbers while reporting on fixed-odds betting terminals too. Above the machines, staff would plaster a notice advertising which numbers had been coming up a lot lately on the machines’ digital roulette games. This, says Sharman, “reinforces the sense that you are basing your decision on something other than complete chance”. At that point, you’re labouring under an illusion that you have some kind of agency.</p><p>我在报道固定赔率投注终端时也遇到了热门数字。在这些机器的上方，工作人员会贴一张告示，上面写着最近在这些机器的数字轮盘赌游戏中经常出现的数字。沙曼说，这“强化了一种感觉，即你的决定不是基于完全的机会”。在这一点上，你正在幻想自己有某种代理。</p><p> José Perales points out that there are different kinds of illusion of control. One type is related to the notion that some person or force other than ourselves is pulling the strings, and that our behaviour might be able to affect that force. That’s something we can recognise in those who believe in the power of prayer, or simple superstition – don’t walk under that ladder or you’ll have bad luck. The other kind is a belief in our own abilities. That’s something at play in those complex football bets – the feeling that you know quite a lot about football so your instinct that Rashford will nab the first goal in a 3–1 win is a decent shout.</p><p>JoséPerales指出，有不同种类的控制错觉。其中一种类型与这样一种观念有关，即除了我们自己之外，还有其他人或力量在幕后操纵，我们的行为可能会影响这种力量。我们可以从那些相信祈祷的力量或简单迷信的人身上看出这一点——不要走在梯子下面，否则你会倒霉的。另一种是相信自己的能力。这是在那些复杂的足球赌注中起作用的东西——感觉你对足球了解很多，所以你本能地认为拉什福德会在3-1的胜利中攻入第一球，这是一个不错的叫喊。</p><p> The illusion of control is a psychological phenomenon that can be particularly effective among the cohort of people most likely to be problem gamblers: young men. Perales contends that young, educated men are particularly susceptible to the mostly illusory notion that they are using their intelligence to get ahead. “Their general reasoning abilities are pretty good. But that doesn’t protect them from developing cognitive biases related to how gambling works. You can feed their sense of confidence and self-worth by designing the product in such a way that you increase the sense of control or the sense that you are learning something.”</p><p>控制错觉是一种心理现象，在最有可能成为问题赌徒的人群中尤其有效：年轻男性。佩雷斯认为，受过教育的年轻人尤其容易受到一种主要是虚幻的观念的影响，即他们正在利用自己的智慧取得成功。“他们的一般推理能力相当好。但这并不能保护他们免受与赌博工作方式有关的认知偏见的影响。你可以通过设计产品来增强他们的自信和自我价值感，从而增强他们的控制感或学习感。”</p><p> This could work by displaying hot numbers or nudging betters towards complex markets where they believe they are well informed. It also works with something incredibly simple, like the mechanism of an online slots game. In some games you click on “spin” and the reels whiz round and stop of their own accord. In others, you can stop them at a moment of your choosing.</p><p>这可以通过展示热门数据或推动更好的人进入他们认为自己信息丰富的复杂市场来实现。它还可以处理非常简单的事情，比如在线老虎机游戏的机制。在一些游戏中，你点击“旋转”，卷轴自动旋转并停止。在其他情况下，你可以选择在某个时刻阻止它们。</p><p> “It’s very difficult to avoid the feeling that the physical process determines the outcome. But it’s just a random-number generator,” says Perales. In other words, whether you stop the spin or you let the computer do it, it doesn’t make a difference. But it somehow  feels as if it does.</p><p>佩雷斯说：“很难避免那种感觉，即物理过程决定结果。但它只是一个随机数生成器。”。换句话说，不管你是停止旋转还是让电脑来做，都没有什么区别。但不知怎么的，感觉好像是这样。</p><p>  Make a simple bet on Tiger Roll to win the Grand National and you lose your stake if the thoroughbred throws his rider at the first fence. There’s no hiding the fact that you’ve lost. That isn’t always the case, though. One of the most common devices that gambling firms use to placate punters and keep them coming back for more are losses disguised as wins.</p><p>在老虎滚上下一个简单的赌注就可以赢得大国家队，如果纯种马把他的骑手扔到第一道栅栏上，你就失去了你的赌注。你输了这件事是无法掩饰的。不过，情况并非总是如此。博彩公司用来安抚赌客并让他们回来索取更多赌金的最常见的手段之一是伪装成赢的损失。</p><p> On a slot machine, you might deposit some money on Egyptology-themed game Eye of Horus, set your bet to £1 and spin. Most of the time you lose the stake. A small percentage of the time you spin and get more than £1 back. But one of the other outcomes is that you lose a portion of your stake, say 50p. At that point, an animated box flashes up saying: “Winner paid 50p.” “Objectively, you’ve still lost,” says Sharman. But the slot machine frames it as a win.</p><p>在老虎机上，你可以在以埃及学为主题的游戏《荷鲁斯之眼》（Eye of Horus）上存入一些钱，将赌注设为1英镑，然后旋转。大多数时候，你失去了赌注。一小部分时间你旋转并拿回超过1英镑。但另一个结果是你失去了一部分股份，比如50便士。这时，一个动画框闪了出来，上面写着：“赢家付了50便士。”“客观上，你还是输了，”沙曼说。但老虎机把它描绘成一场胜利。</p><p> People feel worse when they have a near miss than a massive miss. Yet they make them want to continue gambling more</p><p>人们在未遂事故中的感觉比重大事故更糟。然而，它们让他们更想继续赌博</p><p> Gambling companies have an incentive to ensure you don’t twig that you’re steadily haemorrhaging cash, and that informs the way games are designed. Typically, a machine might flash up with the same music and lights for a win as it does for a loss disguised as a win.</p><p>博彩公司有一个激励机制，确保你不知道自己在不断地流失现金，这也为游戏的设计提供了依据。通常情况下，一台机器可能会闪烁相同的音乐和灯光来赢得比赛，就像它在伪装成胜利的失败中闪烁一样。</p><p> “The only feedback you might get is the lights and sounds,” says Sharman. “So, if there’s no difference between the feedback from a win and a disguised loss, that’s a clever way of tricking the neurological circuitry.”</p><p>“你可能得到的唯一反馈就是灯光和声音，”沙曼说。“所以，如果赢的反馈和变相输的反馈没有区别，那就是欺骗神经回路的聪明方法。”</p><p> In 2020, the Gambling Commission set up a working group to look into ways of making slots and other products safer. One of the results of the process was that the misleading happy music, as well as visual effects that may disguise a loss as a win, were abolished.</p><p>2020年，赌博委员会成立了一个工作组，研究如何使老虎机和其他产品更安全。这个过程的一个结果是，误导性的快乐音乐，以及可能把失败伪装成胜利的视觉效果，都被废除了。</p><p>  The reels on the slot machine  spin.

People feel worse when they have a near miss than when there’s a massive miss. At the same time, they make people want to continue gambling more.”</p><p>“未遂事件非常有趣，”史蒂夫·沙曼说。“他们一直被认为更令人不快。人们在未遂事件中的感觉比在重大未遂事件中更糟糕。同时，他们让人们更想继续赌博。”</p><p> It’s called the house money effect. People are much more risk-seeking with money they’ve won than with money they’ve paid in</p><p>这就是所谓的房钱效应。人们用赢得的钱比用付出的钱更冒险</p><p> Sharman and his fellow researchers decided to test how gamblers react to two different types of slot machine near miss: the ones where the reel spins one place too far, beyond the “payline” (the horizontal axis along which the crucial symbols appear);  and the one where it doesn’t spin far enough. Interestingly, they found that when the reel doesn’t reach the payline, the gambler is more likely to keep playing, having apparently been on the brink of the jackpot. But if the reel moves one place too far, it seems to dissuade people from continuing, almost as if the chance of a win briefly materialised and must now have gone for good. Yet neither outcome actually has any bearing on the result of the next spin.</p><p>沙曼和他的同事们决定测试赌徒对两种不同类型的老虎机未遂事件的反应：一种是卷轴旋转过远，超出了“付款线”（关键符号出现的水平轴）；它旋转的距离不够远。有趣的是，他们发现，当卷轴没有到达付款线时，赌徒更有可能继续玩，因为他们显然已经处于中大奖的边缘。但是，如果卷轴移动了一个地方太远，它似乎会阻止人们继续，几乎就好像获胜的机会短暂实现了，现在肯定已经永远消失了。然而，这两个结果实际上都与下一轮的结果没有任何关系。</p><p> Modern online slot machine games, with multiple lines of play, are more complex than the old-school one-armed bandits. They move much faster too, in order to increase the rate at which they take your money. This makes it harder to spot near misses during regular play. But most slots have bonus features, an occasional moment where the opportunity to win a bigger prize comes up and the gambler pays closer attention, including to near misses. This is when today’s slot machine gambler might be more likely to experience the emotional reaction to the perception that they almost won big.</p><p>现代的吃角子老虎机游戏有多条游戏线路，比老式的独臂土匪游戏更复杂。他们移动的速度也要快得多，以提高他们拿走你的钱的速度。这使得在常规比赛中很难发现未遂事件。但大多数吃角子老虎机都有奖金功能，偶尔会出现赢取更大奖金的机会，赌徒会更加关注，包括未遂事件。在这个时候，今天的老虎机赌徒可能更容易体验到对他们几乎大获全胜的感觉的情绪反应。</p><p>  The feeling that you’re getting a good deal is another motivating factor that makes you more likely to bet. But it’s worth it for the house if it brings you back for a second bet at riskier odds.</p><p>感觉你得到了一笔好交易是另一个促使你更有可能下注的因素。但如果你以更高的赔率再次下注，这对房子来说是值得的。</p><p> One of the products that has emerged in recent years is “boosted odds”, where the bookmaker gives you much longer odds than you would usually get, say 15–1 that a good team such as Chelsea will beat a weaker side like Fulham. Sometimes this will be on offer to new customers only, as a means of driving new account sign-ups.</p><p>近年来出现的一个产品是“提高赔率”，收受赌注者给你的赔率比你通常得到的要长得多，比如说15比1，一支好的球队，比如切尔西，将击败像富勒姆这样的弱队。有时，这将只提供给新客户，作为推动新客户注册的一种手段。</p><p> The same phenomenon is at play with the “free” bets and bonus spins that companies hand out. “It’s called the house money effect,” explains Philip Newall. “People are much more risk-seeking with money they’ve won than with money they’ve paid in.”</p><p>公司发放的“免费”赌注和奖金也存在同样的现象。菲利普·纽沃尔解释说：“这被称为房钱效应。”。“人们用赢得的钱比用付出的钱更冒险。”</p><p> If you get an email saying you’ll get a £50 free bet if you bet £50, you find a way to scrape it together. It’s a little hook back in</p><p>如果你收到一封邮件，说如果你赌50英镑，你将得到50英镑的免费赌注，你会找到一个办法来凑合。这是一个小钩子</p><p> If the house gives you a free spin, you’ve got nothing to lose. Except that such free bets and bonuses usually come with strings attached. You get them, for the most part, only on the condition that you’ll “roll over” the bet into a second or third one. Sometimes the bet has to be rolled over many more times before it can be withdrawn. The house money effect makes that whole process feel like a free ride. Of course, all the while you are becoming habituated to gambling, and you’re more likely to return with your own money and to go on longer rides, this time at your own expense. “The more you bet, the more you’ll get free bets, and the more likely that you give it straight back,” says recovering addict Phil Worrall, from Nottingham. “You might think you’ve got no money left, but if you get an email saying you’ll get a £50 free bet if you bet £50 of your own money, you find a way to scrape it together. It’s a little hook back in.”</p><p>如果房子让你自由旋转，你就没有什么可失去的了。不过，这种免费投注和奖金通常附带条件。在大多数情况下，只有当你将赌注“翻滚”到第二次或第三次时，你才能得到它们。有时，在撤销赌注之前，必须多次翻滚赌注。房钱效应让整个过程感觉像是搭便车。当然，在你逐渐习惯于赌博的同时，你更有可能带着自己的钱回来，并进行更长时间的骑行，这一次的费用由你自己承担。诺丁汉戒毒者菲尔·沃拉尔（Phil Worrall）说：“你赌得越多，你就可以得到越多的免费赌注，而且你越有可能直接把赌注投回来。”。“你可能会认为自己没钱了，但如果你收到一封电子邮件，说如果你自己赌50英镑，你将得到50英镑的免费赌注，你会找到一个办法把它凑起来。这是一个小小的回扣。”</p><p>  T here is a question mark over the extent to which gambling firms are deploying these techniques with precision. Some of these phenomena are so woven into the fabric of certain products that they aren’t so much being weaponised as a fundamental feature of gambling. If you’re at a casino and you put all your chips on 25, spin the roulette wheel and it lands on 26, the only person you can blame for that near miss is Lady Luck, whatever the detrimental effects on you may be. It’s a near miss, but not a manufactured one. It is self-evidently a</p><p>对于赌博公司在多大程度上精确地运用这些技术，这里有一个问号。其中一些现象与某些产品的结构交织在一起，因此它们与其说是被武器化，不如说是赌博的一个基本特征。如果你在一家赌场，把所有筹码都押在25，旋转轮盘赌，轮盘赌落在26，那么你唯一能为那次险些失手而责怪的人就是幸运女神，不管对你有什么不利影响。这是一次侥幸成功，但不是人为制造的。这是不言而喻的一个错误</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/firms/">#firms</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/赌注/">#赌注</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
