As a novice, I would look at their website, their mobile app, and their business model (a marketplace), then come up with an “innovative” entrepreneurial idea and sell it as: “The AirBnB of &lt;whatever industry sounds hot and interesting&gt;.”</p><p>考虑一个成功的创业公司：假设是AirBnB。作为新手，我将研究他们的网站，他们的移动应用程序和他们的商业模式（一个市场），然后提出一个“创新”的创业理念并将其出售为：“任何行业的AirBnB听起来都很有趣。 >。”</p><p> But if you actually watch the  real history of AirBnB, you’ll notice they were more interested in:</p><p> 但是，如果您实际上观看了AirBnB的真实历史，您会发现他们对以下内容更感兴趣：</p><p> Looking for the next “hot” convention instead of increasing their Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR).</p><p> 寻找下一个“热门”惯例，而不是增加其每月经常性收入（MRR）。</p><p> Actually, this story, a fable if you   prefer, is only an extension to the legendary essay by Paul Graham,  do things that don’t scale: “The most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is to recruit users manually.”</p><p> 实际上，这个故事（如果您愿意的话，是一个寓言）只是Paul Graham的传奇文章的延伸，做了无法扩展的事情：“创始人一开始最常见的不可扩展的事情是手动招募用户。 ”</p><p> You see, most of us think of  growth as linear as when going from one place to another and we  progressively get closer to our goal. But that is not at all how startups operate, AirBnB had to transform itself multiple times before getting to be what we recognize today:  the leading marketplace for vacation rental.</p><p> 您会看到，我们大多数人认为增长是线性的，就像从一个地方到另一个地方一样，我们逐渐接近我们的目标。但这根本不是初创公司的运作方式，AirBnB必须进行多次转型，才能成为我们今天所公认的：度假租赁的领先市场。</p><p> “Startups are more similar to caterpillars turning into butterflies than babies turning into young adults.“</p><p> “初创企业更像毛毛虫变成蝴蝶，而不是婴儿变成年轻人。”</p><p> Please note, that this does not happen only during the early stages of a startup but also when doing  “quantum growth leaps” for an example of this I recommend the great  video-exposition by Gustaf Alströmer that details how internationalization and mobile-first design were the key drivers that turned Facebook into the global social media conglomerate it is today.</p><p> 请注意，这不仅发生在初创企业的初期，而且发生在“量子增长突飞猛进”时，例如，我推荐古斯塔夫·阿尔斯特罗默（GustafAlströmer）精彩的视频展览，详细介绍国际化和移动优先设计的方式今天，促使Facebook成为全球社交媒体集团的主要驱动力。</p><p> In short, what I did not understand about Startup Growth is that it has nothing to do with growth itself, it’s all about  transformation.</p><p>简而言之，对于Startup Growth，我不了解的是，它与增长本身无关，而是与转型有关。</p><p>    I wish there exists a better word to describe me ten years ago, but there is no: I was a “fool”. To prove it here are three samples from my first venture:</p><p>    我希望十年前有一个更好的词来形容我，但没有：我是个“傻瓜”。为了证明这一点，这里是我第一次创业的三个样本：</p><p> Dropped from college “to honor” Steve Jobs, I was touched, inspired, and fooled by his  Stanford Commencement Speech.</p><p> 从大学“荣誉”史蒂夫·乔布斯辍学后，他的斯坦福大学毕业典礼致使我感动，鼓舞和愚弄。</p><p> While learning Machine Learning I doomed Economics and its close cousin Econometrics as glorified Linear Regression.</p><p> 在学习机器学习时，我注定经济学和它的近亲计量经济学是光荣的线性回归。</p><p> One week I managed to accurately predict the spread lines of 15 out of 16 matches in the NFL, and still managed to  lose money!</p><p> 一个星期，我设法准确地预测了NFL 16场比赛中15场的差距线，但仍然设法赔钱！</p><p> That’s basically where I was: I saw  sports bets as financial markets, with increasingly rapid returns that could be described as “highly volatile” and “high risk” assets. I thought that if I could apply novel financial and economic techniques paired with AI algorithms to predict the outcomes and grow a business.</p><p> 这基本上就是我的所在：我将体育博彩视为金融市场，其回报越来越快，可谓“高波动性”和“高风险”资产。我以为如果可以应用新颖的金融和经济技术以及AI算法来预测结果并发展业务。</p><p> Now, the insight was not entirely wrong, I even managed to earn 10X returns for a particular year. After my eventual failure, I blamed the “emotional triggers” behind making a decision.  Instead of finding a way to perfect the decision-making process I tried to automate it and outsource it to an algorithm.</p><p> 现在，这种见解并不完全是错误的，我什至设法在特定年份获得了10倍的回报。最终失败之后，我将责任归咎于做出决定的“情感诱因”。我没有找到完善决策过程的方法，而是尝试将其自动化并将其外包给算法。</p><p>  While studying  Machine Learning at Stanford with Andrew Ng, I truly believed I had a number of unfair advantages to succeed in predicting sports outcomes, to number a few of them:</p><p>当我与Andrew Ng在斯坦福大学学习机器学习时，我真的相信自己在成功预测运动成绩方面有许多不公平的优势，其中包括：</p><p> The field of Machine Learning was really innovative back then, and its findings were not fully widespread.</p><p> 当时，机器学习领域确实是创新的，其发现尚未完全普及。</p><p> Sports bets were in a “blind spot” where no major tech or finance firms would be willing to go.</p><p> 体育博彩处于“盲点”，没有大型科技或金融公司愿意参与。</p><p> My approach was a “clever mix” between economics and tech, sufficiently distant fields to have a novel approach.</p><p> 我的方法是经济学和技术之间的“巧妙结合”，这是一个遥远的领域，可以采用一种新颖的方法。</p><p> I was a sports enthusiast and could spot correlations and draw hypotheses not obvious from a pure data perspective.</p><p> 我是一名体育迷，可以发现相关性，并从纯数据角度得出不明显的假设。</p><p> This model based on technological innovation was inspired by  how Google became Google: I saw it as outstanding innovations in algorithms to search the web. My attempts, however, followed a different path: after years of developing fancy unreliable reinforcement learning models I had nothing to show off. I was fortunate, though, that with the advent of Deep Learning it was evident there was no way to compete in the field of Artificial Intelligence with the vast resources a tech giant had at their disposal.</p><p> 这种基于技术创新的模型的灵感来自Google成为Google的方式：我将其视为搜索网络的算法方面的杰出创新。但是，我的尝试却走了一条不同的道路：经过多年的发展，建立了不可靠的强化学习模型之后，我再也没有表现出来。但是，我幸运的是，随着深度学习的到来，很明显，没有办法与科技巨头可利用的大量资源竞争人工智能领域。</p><p> I was not alone in my failure: there are notable examples of why trying to build a company based purely on technological innovation is futile, my favorite:  Theranos. In retrospect, I attribute the success of Google not only to the innovative “PageRank” algorithm but also to its innovative UX, high-margin business model, exceptional recruitment, and the fact that Sergey and Larry are exceptional persons themselves, not only brilliant PhDs.</p><p> 在失败中我并不孤单：举个著名的例子，为什么仅凭技术创新来建立公司是徒劳的，我最喜欢的是Theranos。回想起来，我将Google的成功不仅归功于创新的“ PageRank”算法，还归功于其创新的用户体验，高利润商业模式，出色的招聘以及Sergey和Larry本身就是杰出人物，不仅是杰出的博士学位。</p><p> While there are plenty of startups that follow this tech-innovation-driven model as  Boom, the supersonic plane company, or many others in the BioTech industry. Now, I prefer to take it one step at a time.</p><p>尽管有很多创业公司遵循这种以技术创新为动力的模式，例如Boom，超音速飞机公司或生物技术行业中的许多其他公司。现在，我希望一次跨一步。</p><p> “You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet” — Jordin Sparks</p><p> “你想展示世界，但没人知道你的名字” –乔丹·斯帕克斯（Jordin Sparks）</p><p>    Hooked to the startup ethos, I did some freelancing and joined as an early engineer to other startups, looking to learn and have a better shot next time. During that time, I was fortunate to accumulate plenty of knowledge and experiences about what a startup looks like. An experience I treasure until this day is that time when I realized what  “exponential growth” truly meant.</p><p>    迷上了初创公司的精神，我做了一些自由职业，并以早期工程师的身份加入了其他初创公司，希望下次学习并获得更好的机会。在那段时间里，我很幸运地积累了很多关于创业公司的知识和经验。直到今天，我珍惜的一次经历是我意识到“指数式增长”的真正含义。</p><p> When you read about double-digit weekly growth rates it will probably be described in a romantic tone, a nirvana-like experience: the satisfaction of having found success, the feeling of accomplishment, certainty that you are doing well, have a good product, and eventually, you’ll become a millionaire. To me, they are wrong! Let me tell you how 10X growth looked to me:</p><p> 当您读到两位数的每周增长率时，可能会以浪漫的语气来描述，这就像一个必杀技：经历成功的满足感，成就感，确定自己做得很好，拥有好的产品，最终，您将成为百万富翁。对我来说，他们错了！让我告诉您，我看到10倍的增长：</p><p> Imagine you have a business, and every given month you have a good sales day. You are happy you made a profit, and are well-off for the next month. Now imagine yourself one-year later: a single customer is demanding a “special deal” to make purchase 10 times the amount of your best day only one year before, however, it&#39;s not only one customer, you are dealing with three of them each one requiring special accommodations to make the purchase. Desperate, you look upstairs, face the owner, and explain to him we can’t go through this, we are not prepared,  we are making a mistake. Except that you do not say it, you yell it! Everyone is busy, there is no data to back those decisions, no certainty, and know that a single error can cost the business survival.</p><p> 假设您经营一家公司，每个月都有一个不错的销售日。您很高兴获得了利润，并且下个月的生活很轻松。现在，想象一下自己在一年后：一位客户要求“特殊交易”以购买一年前最佳交易日金额的10倍，但是，这不仅是一位客户，而且每个客户要与他们交易三笔一位需要特殊住宿才能购买的东西。绝望，您在楼上抬头，面对房东，并向他解释我们无法办到，我们没有准备，我们正在犯错。除了不说，你大声说！每个人都很忙，没有数据可以支持这些决策，没有确定性，并且知道单个错误会导致企业生存。</p><p>  While I’m not planning to share a story behind each of the 10 takeaways during my tenure as an early employee. I can say that those years provided invaluable experience, good and fun times, and it’s a highly recommended path for anyone looking to be an entrepreneur. I share the main lessons learned as a Software Engineer:</p><p>  虽然我不打算在我作为一名早期员工的任职期间分享10个外卖活动背后的故事。我可以说，那些年提供了宝贵的经验，美好而有趣的时光，对于任何想成为企业家的人来说，这都是一条强烈推荐的道路。我分享了作为软件工程师学到的主要经验教训：</p><p> Good marketers add more value than software engineers, their contributions are vital to the company’s revenue.</p><p> 优秀的营销人员比软件工程师能增加更多的价值，他们的贡献对公司的收入至关重要。</p><p> Investors are nice, smart, empowering individuals, however, being generous is not part of their job.</p><p>投资者友善，聪明，能赋予个人权力，但是慷慨大方并不是他们工作的一部分。</p><p> Having a solid, coherent, sustainable business model is an uncanny advantage, invest in it as much as you do in your product.</p><p> 拥有坚实，连贯，可持续的商业模式是一个不可思议的优势，对它的投资与对产品的投入一样多。</p><p> For software engineers, the technology you work with is far more correlated to your future earning potential than the startup’s success.</p><p> 对于软件工程师来说，与您合作的技术与您的未来获利潜力远不如初创企业的成功相关。</p><p> Building a product or adding new features is mostly a fun activity, but before doing it think: am I willing to maintain this source code?</p><p> 制作产品或添加新功能通常是一项有趣的活动，但在这样做之前，请先想一想：我是否愿意维护此源代码？</p><p> Pick your first customers wisely, success is as dependant on them as it is on the quality of the team.</p><p> 明智地选择您的第一个客户，成功与否取决于他们，取决于团队的素质。</p><p>  Plan, document, and diagram before you drop your code, after all, you are an engineer: is better to imagine you are building a bridge than an app.</p><p>  在删除代码之前计划，文档和绘制图表，毕竟，您是一名工程师：比起应用程序，更能想象自己正在搭建桥梁。</p><p> It’s amazing what a small team of highly- motivated, committed individuals can do by themselves: they can take a whole industry by surprise!</p><p> 一小组充满激情，有事业心的个人可以自己做的事情真是太神奇了：他们可以为整个行业带来惊喜！</p><p>     I quitted my job at the possibility of joining an overseas startup, it was a unique stage in my life: everything around stayed still as if I was pushed to make a decision,  to take  ownership of my life. I was lucky, I got the job and while gathering the paperwork I found myself with two months free of work, it was the perfect opportunity to give entrepreneurship a second serious try.</p><p>我辞职的原因是有可能加入一家海外创业公司，那是我一生中的一个独特阶段：周围的一切都保持静止，就好像我被迫做出决定，决定拥有自己的生活。我很幸运，找到了工作，在收集文书工作的同时，我发现自己有两个月的空闲时间，这是再次尝试创业的绝好机会。</p><p> I was bursting inside, after not taking any holidays for over three years freedom was a new feeling, leaving behind the uncertainty it carried, I see those very happy weeks I had for a while: I regained control of my time, my health was at it’s highest: I finally followed a nutritionist’s advice, and felt the most creative I had been in years.</p><p> 三年多没有任何假期后，我感到内心burst发，自由是一种新感觉，抛弃了不确定性，我看到了一段很开心的几周：我重新控制了时间，健康了。这是最高的：我终于听了营养学家的建议，并感觉到我多年来最富有创造力。</p><p>  In a buoyant economy, approaching full employment, and Software Engineers being the strongest commodity out there, I decided to take on the recruiting industry!  I had a beautiful insight: recruiters work, care, and are paid by companies but it was in those times that  Software Engineers had the leverage. My startup would care for them, for their best interest.</p><p>  在蓬勃发展的经济中，即将获得充分就业，并且软件工程师是那里最强大的商品，我决定从事招聘行业！我有一个很好的见解：招聘人员可以工作，照料公司并由公司支付薪水，但是在那个时期，软件工程师才具有影响力。我的创业公司会照顾他们，以他们的最大利益为目标。</p><p> With so many jobs around, I approached it as a search problem and decided to tackle it with the visualization of two main components: expected salary &amp; technological stack. Given that remote was not as big back then, I embed them in a geographical map to highlight location &amp; used a pretty clever NLP and Deep Learning technique to parameterize the companies’ pitch.</p><p> 有了这么多工作，我将其作为搜索问题来解决，并决定通过可视化两个主要组成部分来解决它：期望薪水和技术堆栈。考虑到当时的遥控器还不算大，我将它们嵌入了地理地图中以突出显示位置，并使用了非常巧妙的NLP和深度学习技术来参数化公司的业务。</p><p> I then followed the best of YCombinator’s advice: installed Product Intelligence Analytics Software and launched it across several sites. I was thrilled, motivated, and engaged, I even got some raving reviews for it.</p><p> 然后，我遵循了YCombinator的最佳建议：安装了Product Intelligence Analytics软件，并在多个站点上启动了该软件。我很兴奋，很积极并且很投入，甚至为此受到了好评。</p><p>  Well, you know the story: it was easy to drive visitors to the site, impossible to convince them to go back. After multiple minor iterations:  not a single visitor turned into a user. Entrepreneurs sometimes need to lie to themselves, sometimes you need for others to lie to you,  whatever it takes to keep the hope alive. And I did: I convinced myself the product was not mobile-first, that I needed more data, the recommendation engine was not good enough, and while powerful the UX was also confusing. Time to pivot!</p><p>  好吧，您知道这个故事：吸引访客到站点很容易，无法说服他们回去。经过多次次要迭代：没有一个访客变成用户。企业家有时需要对自己撒谎，有时您需要其他人对您撒谎，无论采取什么措施来维持希望。我做到了：我确信自己的产品不是移动优先的，我需要更多的数据，推荐引擎还不够好，而功能强大的UX也令人困惑。时间到了！</p><p> No problem, I’m a good developer: reworked the UX from scratch and it mobile-first, with a very familiar interface. I developed a smart, highly-performant recommendation engine and scrapped more than enough data to satisfy thousands of users.</p><p> 没问题，我是一名优秀的开发人员：通过一个非常熟悉的界面从头开始重新设计UX，并且首先在移动设备上进行。我开发了一个智能的，高性能的推荐引擎，并收集了足够多的数据来满足成千上万的用户。</p><p> The problem:  that second version never saw the light, I was tired of pouring my soul every week to make a new release that had  minimal impact, of begging people to give their feedback, and looking for partnerships than conducted nowhere. The final blow was that nowhere on the horizon a glimpse of revenue could be seen.  I was doing it all wrong!</p><p>问题是：第二个版本从来没有见过光，我厌倦了每周投入我的灵魂来制作一个影响最小的新版本，乞求人们提供反馈，以及寻找合作伙伴。最后的打击是，在地平线上看不到任何收益。我做错了！</p><p>  It’s funny how you can be so wrong, on so many levels, looking back I really thought I got rid of the entrepreneurial bug, I would embrace my new job,  leave the startup chimera behind and consolidate as an outstanding engineer.</p><p>  如此多的层面上，你怎么会错是很有趣的，回首过去，我真的以为我摆脱了创业缺陷，我会接受我的新工作，抛弃初创公司的魅力，并成为一名杰出的工程师。</p><p> “What I faced was a distribution problem: how to tell people what I was building and why they needed it.”</p><p> “我面临的是分配问题：如何告诉人们我在建造什么，以及为什么他们需要它。”</p><p>    Entrepreneurs are a rare breed of humans: generally, we tend to deal with a duel or failure following the classic five steps: denial, anger, negotiation, depression, and acceptance. But it’s in that last step that entrepreneurs take a different path, for some reason  acceptance is not in our DNA.</p><p>    企业家是人类的一种稀有物种：通常，我们倾向于按照以下五个经典步骤来应对决斗或失败：拒绝，愤怒，谈判，沮丧和接受。但是，在最后一步中，企业家走了一条不同的道路，出于某种原因，接受并不是我们的DNA。</p><p> To me, it started as cynism, rewatching all that material for entrepreneurs and making fun of it: of the desperate, ingenious idea that a business could be born by the average Joe. I started to see entrepreneurship as the result of privilege, maybe luck, but nothing more. Sure, if you have an endless streak of attempts or an infinite supply of resources: sooner, rather than later a home run will hit a home-run. But there was nothing scientific to learn about being an entrepreneur.</p><p> 对我而言，它始于玩世不恭，重新审视企业家的所有材料并取笑：绝望而又巧妙的想法，即一家普通的Joe可以创办一家企业。我开始看到企业家精神是特权，也许是运气的结果，但仅此而已。当然，如果您有无穷无尽的尝试尝试或无限的资源供应：那么本垒打将早于而不是本垒打。但是，要成为一名企业家，没有什么科学可学。</p><p> Professor of Psychology Barbara Fredrickson argues that hope comes into its own when crisis looms,  opening us to new creative possibilities. To me,  hope is the result of a suppressed desire that finds a minimal, external validation. And between finding being a Software Engineer unchallenging and witnessing the lame efforts by established organizations to fight the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic it was then, that I heard the inner voice once again: “You can do it, today is the perfect day for innovation.”</p><p> 心理学教授芭芭拉·弗雷德里克森（Barbara Fredrickson）辩称，当危机迫在眉睫时，希望就变成了现实，这为我们提供了新的创造可能性。对我来说，希望是被压抑的欲望的结果，而这种欲望找到了最小的外部验证。在发现自己是一名软件工程师时，我面临着挑战，并见证了成熟的组织为应对持续进行的COVID-19大流行所做的不懈努力，那时，我再次听到内心的声音：“您可以做到，今天是创新的完美之日。”</p><p> It started as a whisper, an  ex-Uber guy mentioned that someone had pursued creating 12 startups in 12 months. I thought: that’s the rational thing to do, maximize your chances, build a shared codebase. Heck! at some point, you could even deliver a new project every week. I figured it was relatively fast to know whether a project would succeed or not: just the moment after launch. And something else he mentioned: it was called “IndieHackers” a place for aspiring entrepreneurs to hang out.</p><p> 最初是耳语，一位前优步人提到有人在12个月内创立了12家创业公司。我认为：这是合理的做法，可以最大限度地利用机会，建立共享的代码库。哎呀！在某个时候，您甚至可以每周交付一个新项目。我认为知道一个项目是否成功相对较快：就在启动后的那一刻。他还提到了其他一些东西：它被称为“ IndieHackers”，是有抱负的企业家可以闲逛的地方。</p><p>  He mentioned it with such familiarity as if everyone already knew about this place, the site had a dark background and used fluorescent colors for buttons, it also featured a very logical  six-step process to get you started as an entrepreneur, or as they called themselves  “IndieHackers”. I was intrigued, excited to say the least.</p><p>他很熟悉地提到它，好像每个人都已经知道这个地方一样，该网站的背景很暗，荧光灯的按钮采用了荧光色，它还具有非常合逻辑的六步过程，可以让您以企业家的身份入手，或者他们称之为自己是“ IndieHackers”。至少可以说，我很感兴趣。</p><p> The site featured posts from bright Software Engineers and highly-motivated folks living the dream: paradisiac locations, constant travel, and 20 hour work weeks, they engaged in creative activities outside, far away from the standard enterprise life. Podcasts contained the stories of those that had made it big, and the overall feel was of incredible support among the community members.</p><p> 该站点上的文章来自聪明的软件工程师和充满梦想的，富有动力的人们：天堂般的位置，持续的旅行和20小时的工作周，他们在远离标准企业生活的地方从事创造性活动。播客包含了那些使之壮大的故事，总体感觉得到了社区成员的难以置信的支持。</p><p> They spoke about  a radically new concept, to me, called “building in public”, it was a diametrical approach from the closed source, IP-driven, full of NDAs and secrecy many legacy companies used to follow. While the concept of sharing every step when building a company sounded intimidating, possibly even dangerous (many worry their “idea” would be stolen). Having worked on so many startups and a couple of larger enterprises myself: I knew how little room for innovation there was within established companies -they are all so busy-, how important execution is instead of having a “good idea” and how other “tangible” assets are quiet worthless instead without the right team around them. More than that:</p><p> 他们谈到了一个全新的概念，对我来说是一个“公共建筑”，它是一种封闭的，截然不同的方法，它是由知识产权驱动的，由NDA组成的，充满保密性的NDA和许多传统公司过去遵循的保密性。尽管在建立公司时分享每一步的概念听起来很吓人，但可能甚至很危险（许多人担心他们的“想法”会被窃取）。我自己曾在多家初创公司和几家较大的企业工作过：我知道老牌公司的创新空间很小-他们都很忙-执行具有多么重要而不是拥有一个“好主意”，而其他“ “有形”资产是安静的，毫无价值的资产，而周围没有合适的团队。比那更多的：</p><p> “Building in public was the quintessential solution for the distribution problem I faced.”</p><p> “在公共场所建造是解决我所面临的分配问题的典型解决方案。”</p><p>  Remember Twitter? That odd Social Network that never quite lived to the hype? that does not serve a real purpose? Well, allow me to share three personal stories on why it is the perfect medium for founders building in public:</p><p>  还记得Twitter吗？那种奇怪的社交网络，从来没有真正被炒作过？那没有真正的目的吗？好吧，让我分享三个个人故事，说明为什么它是创始人在公开场合进行创作的理想媒介：</p><p> Great audience: The discovery was fortuitous, I work hard and long to produce a delightful piece of content about Microservice Architecture. Usually, I share it with my 2,000 Linkedin connections, for some reason I clicked the button “Share with Twitter” as well, I knew most recruiters on Linkedin would not read about my dissertations and design patterns. But what I was not expecting at all was that with only 6 followers I would get 5X more views from Twitter than Linkedin. “Perhaps Twitter is, after all, the place to be.”</p><p> 伟大的读者：这个发现是偶然的，我努力工作了很长时间，以撰写有关微服务架构的令人愉快的内容。通常，我与我的2,000个Linkedin连接共享它，由于某种原因，我也单击了“与Twitter共享”按钮，我知道Linkedin上的大多数招聘人员都不会读到我的论文和设计模式。但是我根本没想到的是，只有6个关注者，我从Twitter上获得的浏览量将比Linkedin多5倍。 “毕竟，Twitter也许是应有的地方。”</p><p> Praise and recognition: You know Sundays? time for randomness and laziness in your life, on one of those, I had a smart thought: it was an acronym for a particular technological stack. Now, where to share it? Well, nobody really uses Linkedin on weekends, so why not try Twitter instead? What would you know? A couple of blog posts attributed my Tweet, it was a strange feeling:  being credited, recognized.</p><p> 表扬和认可：您知道星期天吗？在您生活中的随机性和懒惰时间上，我想到了一个聪明的主意：这是特定技术堆栈的首字母缩写。现在，在哪里分享呢？好吧，周末没有人真正使用Linkedin，那么为什么不尝试使用Twitter？你会知道什么有几篇博客文章将我的Tweet归因于我，这是一种奇怪的感觉：被认可，被认可。</p><p> Sudden virality: Remember I’m Engineer, Software Engineer, by definition I’m a private, introverted person. Using social media is not natural to me, I only develop it, do not use it myself. So it was natural to me to downplay this emotion called: “going viral”, being seen, lauded. Until I experienced it: how would I know? It actually feels good, a well-documented rush of happiness that runs through your blood, pumps your heart, and leaves you making for more.</p><p>突然的病毒传播：记住我是工程师，软件工程师，从定义上说我是一个内向的私人人物。使用社交媒体对我来说并不自然，我只是开发它，而不是自己使用它。因此，我很自然地淡化了这种被称为“被病毒感染”的情感，被称赞。在我经历之前：我怎么知道？事实证明，这感觉真好，流淌在您的血液中，奔腾着您的心脏，让您有更多的幸福感。</p><p>     I remember it like yesterday, only a few hours away from my last day at work. I could finally attend the much-awaited Start-up School group meetings for founders. I was ecstatic, but what happened next was even more interesting: each one of us had its turn to share about our “startups”, what were we building, what were our goals and struggles. That’s when I found it:  my moat, I spoke about what I discovered: distribution channels, the importance of having an audience, and how to easily lower customer acquisition costs. I could feel the engagement in the room, feel my excitement of delivering new information, and the satisfaction of changing other people’s views.</p><p>     我记得昨天一样，离我上班的最后一天只有几个小时。我终于可以参加期待已久的创始人创业小组会议。我欣喜若狂，但接下来发生的事情更加有趣：我们每个人都轮流分享我们的“初创企业”，我们正在建设什么，我们的目标和奋斗什么。就是那时，我发现了它：我的护城河，我谈到了我发现的东西：分销渠道，拥有观众的重要性以及如何轻松降低客户获取成本。我可以感觉到房间里的参与度，可以感受到提供新信息的兴奋，也可以满意地改变别人的观点。</p><p> I knew this distribution problem was not only about me, it was bigger than that. Other entrepreneurs also, ake, suffer from it, and you can help them. Most importantly, I could sense in my tone, the fire spreading through my cheeks, the heart pumping fast, and recovering that passion dormant during my last days as a Software Engineer.</p><p> 我知道这个发行问题不仅与我有关，而且比我还要大。其他企业家也受苦于此，您可以为他们提供帮助。最重要的是，在我担任软件工程师的最后几天里，我可以感觉到自己的语气，双颊蔓延开来的火焰，快速跳动的心脏以及恢复沉寂的激情。</p><p>  “The knowledge that will revolutionize how we understand, teach, think and do entrepreneurship.”</p><p>  “将彻底改变我们如何理解，教导，思考和开展企业家精神的知识。”</p><p> After finding a problem worth solving, I had to go against every instinct not to build a product around it. So what to do then!?</p><p> 找到值得解决的问题后，我不得不违背本能，不要围绕它开发产品。那么该怎么办！</p><p> Turns out, that for every problem you can think there is most probably already a lot of documentation on the topic: books, articles, videos, and forums. The purpose is to become an “expert” on it. Do not be intimidated, by delimiting your niche it should not take too long to gather a substantial amount of information about it.</p><p> 事实证明，对于每个问题，您都可以认为已经有很多关于该主题的文档：书籍，文章，视频和论坛。目的是成为它的“专家”。请勿因定界您的利基而被吓到，它不需要花费太多时间就可以收集有关它的大量信息。</p><p> The best part of this becoming an “expert” is that it actually  leads to developing an audience, just by sharing your learning path, outliving your thoughts, and giving recognition to experts you’ll have a great panorama of how the industry is shaped and develop key relationships with fellow leaders in the field.</p><p> 成为“专家”的最大好处是，实际上，通过分享您的学习道路，超越自己的想法并给予专家认可，可以真正培养受众，从而使您对行业的形成和发展有一个全面的了解。与该领域的领导者建立重要关系。</p><p> During that research process, you’ll also come aware of the competition, the main players in the space, and who suffers the most from the problem you are trying to solve.</p><p>在该研究过程中，您还将了解竞争，该领域的主要参与者以及谁在尝试解决的问题中遭受的痛苦最大。</p><p> Please note, that while radically logical, this process  is drastically different from the status quo  of building an MVP.</p><p> 请注意，虽然从根本上讲是逻辑的，但此过程与建立MVP的现状大不相同。</p><p>  Believe me, if you do not have a reproducible way to fix the problem you encountered: there is zero chance you’ll solve the problem with Software.</p><p>  相信我，如果您没有可重复的方法来解决所遇到的问题：使用软件解决问题的机会为零。</p><p> Remember, software is good but is also dumb, it can only work for you if there is already an automatic way to solve the problem. After all, developing  software is all about conditionals and iterations. Everything else is a fancy abstraction of the above.</p><p> 请记住，软件是好的，但也很笨，只有在已经有自动解决问题的方法时，它才对您有用。毕竟，开发软件都是关于条件和迭代的。其他所有内容都是上面的漂亮抽象。</p><p> Will this approach work for any problem? Absolutely not! But it is the best path for being a succesful entrepreneur.</p><p> 这种方法能解决任何问题吗？绝对不！但这是成为成功企业家的最佳途径。</p><p> After finding a way to solve the problem, it’s a good time to monetize it. Else, why would you invest in building a product if you can’t make money from it?</p><p> 找到解决问题的方法后，现在是利用它获利的好时机。否则，如果您不能从中获利，为什么还要投资于开发产品？</p><p> The good news? You already have an audience (and growing every day) that cares about your problem. So who are you going to sell your solution to? Well to your audience!! See? Simple and works!</p><p> 好消息？您已经有一个关心您问题的观众（并且每天都在增长）。那么您打算将解决方案卖给谁？好听的！！看到？简单而有效！</p><p>   This is the mythical inflection point in every startup journey: once you have found product-market fit. When everyone wants a piece of your product that you can barely keep up with demand, and investors fight for a piece of your pie.</p><p>这是每次创业过程中的神话拐点：一旦找到适合市场的产品。当每个人都想要一块您的产品时，您几乎无法满足需求，而投资者则在争夺一块蛋糕。</p><p> If you have the right understanding of your product and audience. You will know how to approach them. To me, product-market-fit is attained when you are able to cold message someone and less than 20 seconds later you get an overwhelmingly positive response demanding your product.</p><p> 如果您对产品和受众有正确的了解。您将知道如何处理它们。对我而言，当您能够向某人发送消息时，就可以实现产品与市场的契合，而不到20秒后，您就会收到要求您的产品的压倒性的积极响应。</p><p>  You might be thinking, where are the millions I was promised? The investors fighting for me? The interviews, and glam life I was looking forward to? But especially, where is the software, how can I build a startup without tech?</p><p>  您可能在想，我应许的千百万在哪里？投资者为我而战？采访以及我期待的华丽生活？但是尤其是软件在哪里，如果没有技术，我该如何建立一家初创公司？</p><p> All things come at the right time: and after becoming proficient in solving the problem, dominating your sales funnel, and being recognized as an expert in the field. Once you accumulated that knowledge, the experience, track record, and have a sufficiently big audience.  You’ll then be able to produce and sell an InfoPrdouct!</p><p> 万事俱备：在精通解决问题的能力之后，主导了您的销售漏斗，并被公认为该领域的专家。积累了这些知识之后，您便会拥有丰富的经验，往绩记录并拥有足够的听众。这样您就可以生产和销售InfoPrdouct！</p><p> Coming from a Software background, it might seem insulting. After all, are you telling me that a book, video course, or podcast can replace the beauty I bring into the world? Yes!!  Before automating a solution to t</p><p> 从软件背景来看，它似乎是侮辱性的。毕竟，您是在告诉我书，视频课程或播客可以代替我带给世界的美丽吗？是！！在自动化解决方案之前</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://santiagoq.medium.com/dont-build-a-startup-grow-an-audience-89b810ec891c">https://santiagoq.medium.com/dont-build-a-startup-grow-an-audience-89b810ec891c</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/初创/">#初创</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/build/">#build</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
