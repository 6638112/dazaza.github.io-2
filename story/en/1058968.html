Losing sight of what makes you happy, maybe. Or alternatively, how to create a really bad bonus incentive program. -Mad Ned</p><p>我开始这篇文章认为它将是非常技术性的，只有吸引工程类型的人群，但事实证明这故事是关于别的东西。可能会让你开心的东西失去。或者，如何创建一个非常糟糕的奖励激励计划。 -mad ned.</p><p>  In 1996, I was working for  Digital Equipment Corporation, at the time the second largest computer company in the world. Today most people have never heard of it. I still find it amazing how quickly such a huge company could just vanish, seemingly without a trace. Digital, or DEC as it was popularly known, had a long, storied history in the computer world. It was a leader in the transition towards making smaller, ‘mini’ systems that brought computers out of the controlled machine room, and into the direct hands of people in the office, school, and lab. DEC was a pioneer in that regard, a cool, new, disruptive company for the older mainframe-style competitors like IBM.</p><p>  1996年，我在世界第二大电脑公司时为数字设备公司工作。今天大多数人从未听说过它。我仍然觉得这么庞大的公司可能只是消失的速度，似乎没有痕迹。数字，或者是普遍闻名的Dec，在电脑世界中有一个漫长的历史。它是朝向制作较小的“迷你”系统的过渡的领导者，这些系统将计算机带出控制的机房，以及办公室，学校和实验室的人的直接手。 DEC是这方面的先驱，一个酷，新的，颠覆的公司，用于旧的大型机式竞争对手，如IBM。</p><p>    Sadly and somewhat ironically, in 1996 DEC itself was in the process of falling victim to disruptive competition. Smaller and quicker companies like  Sun Microsystems and the PC manufacturers had eaten deeply into the business by making even smaller and even cheaper computers. Within a year of the start of this story, DEC would be sold off to it’s competitors, and cease to exist as a public company. Much has been written about that tragic fall (see link above), but that is not the cautionary tale I’m planning to tell here. This one is about what happens when money becomes your only motivator, and how the expectation of money can make you do irrational things.</p><p>    可悲的是，有些讽刺的是，1996年，DEC本身就是造成破坏性竞争的牺牲品。像Sun Microsystems这样的较小和更快的公司通过制造更小甚至更便宜的计算机，深入地食用。在这个故事开始的一年内，DEC将被卖给它的竞争对手，并停止作为公共公司。很多关于那个悲惨的堕落（见上面的链接），但这不是我打算在这里告诉我的警告。这一个是关于金钱成为你唯一的动机时会发生什么，以及金钱的期望如何让你做不理的事情。</p><p> So, 1996 then. I was already a ten-year veteran of the company at this point, and I was working as a hardware systems engineer in the Alpha Workstations group in Maynard, Massachusetts. My job was to design CPU cards and motherboards for Alpha NT workstations, which were a strange hybrid thing built from a proprietary company CPU technology, but which were capable of running Microsoft Windows NT, the ‘business version’ of Windows of the day.</p><p> 那么，1996年。此时我已经是该公司的十年退伍军人，我正在马萨诸塞州Maynard的Alpha工作站集团的硬件系统工程师。我的工作是为Alpha NT工作站设计CPU卡和主板，这是一家由专有公司CPU技术建造的奇怪的混合动力车，但能够运行Microsoft Windows NT，这是一天的Windows的“商业版”。</p><p> In previous years, DEC had developed its own operating systems (VMS), and also built Unix-based workstations, but at this time the company was trying to fortress our place in the workstation market segment, which was rapidly moving towards cheaper Intel / Windows systems. Our Alpha processor was much faster than anything out there at the time, but did not run Intel-based software directly. Because of this limitation, most programs had to be emulated, which slowed things down to the point of losing much of the advantage we offered.</p><p> 在过去几年中，DED开发了自己的操作系统（VMS），并建立了基于UNIX的工作站，但此时该公司试图在工作站市场部分堡垒堡垒，这迅速走向更便宜的英特尔/窗户系统。我们的Alpha处理器在此时的内容速度快得多，但没有直接运行基于英特尔的软件。由于这个限制，大多数计划必须被仿真，这减缓了失去我们所提供的大部分优势的点。</p><p> It was kind of a desperate, intractable situation, and we were struggling to survive. Management was pushing to build new projects faster and cheaper than had ever been done before, attempting to squeeze what used to take years down into months. So they launched a secret incentive program, available to a small group of R&amp;D engineers on key projects, to try to achieve these goals.</p><p> 这是一种绝望的，难以解决的情况，我们正在努力生存。管理层正在推动建立新项目比以往更快，更便宜，试图挤压过去几个月的时间。因此，他们推出了一个秘密激励计划，可用于一小组R＆amp; D工程师在重点项目上，试图实现这些目标。</p><p> In this program, two million dollars were set aside as a potential bonus fund for the participants. The maximum theoretical payout for an engineer was going to be $25,000, and the whole thing was kept secret since many, including our manufacturing and tech support staff working on the project, were not part of it. When I was told I was to be included in this program, I was in the midst of designing the CPU card for the  Alpha XL366 NT Workstation. This was to be our low cost workstation that included the latest Digital Alpha processor, running at (what was at the time) a crazy-fast 366Mhz speed — more than double the speed of our competition.</p><p> 在本计划中，作为参与者的潜在奖金基金被搁置了200万美元。工程师的最大理论支付将是25,000美元，而整个事情都是秘密，因为许多人包括在项目上工作的制造和技术支持人员，不是其中的一部分。当我被告知我被纳入这个计划时，我正在为Alpha XL366 NT工作站设计CPU卡。这是我们的低成本工作站，包括最新的数字alpha处理器，在（当时是什么）疯狂的366MHz速度 - 我们竞争速度的增加。 </p><p>    $25,000 was not enough money to retire on for sure, even in 1996. I knew that making that much money would not have made me rich, but it was still a lot of money, and it was far and above any kind of bonus I had ever seen from the company. But the fine print of the incentive plan was, you made  UP  to $25,000. The way it was to be awarded was, you earned a certain fraction of the $25K total for every percent you shaved off the target manufacturing cost of the system, and you also earned a certain percentage for every day you shaved off the target schedule for the release of the system. So if you could build your project cheap enough and fast enough, everyone on the team could earn up to $25K. Everyone who was invited in, that is.</p><p>即使在1996年，我也没有足够的钱退休。从公司看过。但是，激励计划的精细印刷是，你的价格高达25,000美元。奖励的方式是，您占据了系统的目标制造成本的每一项百分之一的25,000美元的一小部分，您也为您剃掉了目标时间表的每一天获得了一定的百分比系统的释放。因此，如果您可以将您的项目齐全和足够快，团队中的每个人都可以赚到25,000美元。那些被邀请的人，即。</p><p> If you are guessing that this setup was a recipe for disaster, you would be right. Cracks began to form in the plan, almost immediately. My problem was, I was well into the design of my hardware and I had already designed a more expensive 8-layer printed circuit board, and also locked in a fair number of higher-quality but pricey components. This limited what I could do to control costs, but I could still try to get things done faster. By contrast, some of my peers were working on a parallel project which had just started, and they could immediately adjust the design to maximize their cost and schedule savings, as well as their payout.</p><p> 如果您猜测此设置是灾难的配方，那么您将是对的。裂缝开始在计划中形成，几乎立即形成。我的问题是，我进入了我的硬件的设计，我已经设计了一个更昂贵的8层印刷电路板，并锁定在更高的更高质量但昂贵的组件中。这种有限我可以做些什么来控制成本，但我仍然可以试图更快地完成。相比之下，我的一些同行正在研究刚刚开始的并行项目，他们可以立即调整设计，以最大限度地提高其成本和安排节省，以及他们的支付。</p><p> Our product team grumbled about that, because it seemed unfair that one team could have a better potential to maximize their bonus than another. But as I will explain shortly, the real problems emerged later, once the hardware was designed and built.</p><p> 我们的产品团队抱怨了，因为它似乎是不公平的，即一支球队可以有更好的潜力来最大限度地提高他们的奖金。但正如我很快解释的那样，一旦硬件设计和建造，就会出现真正的问题。</p><p> The design phase of this project was easily the most stressful work environment I have ever been in. Over a span of two or three months, we designed and built a complete workstation, a development cycle that previously took six months and before that, years. I remember being in shouting matches with our signal integrity team about among other things, how many capacitors we needed. These tiny devices evened out the power of the system, but they wanted far too many to be added to allow the design cheap and easy to build. I eventually won the argument by taking a previous workstation we built and going to the lab, removing about half the capacitors on it with a soldering iron while measuring the power output, to prove that the signal integrity remained good and that our standards had become too conservative.</p><p> 这个项目的设计阶段很容易是我曾经进入过的最具压力的工作环境。我们在两到三个月内完成了一个完整的工作站，这是一个以前花了六个月的发展周期，年前。我记得与我们的信号完整性团队在其他事情中喊叫喊叫，我们需要多少电容器。这些微小的设备均匀地出现了系统的力量，但它们才能添加到很多人来添加，以便设计便宜且易于建立。我最终通过采取以前的工作站赢得了争论，我们建造并进入了实验室，在测量功率输出的同时用烙铁去除大约一半的电容器，以证明信号完整性仍然很好，我们的标准也变得越来越好保守的。</p><p>    The Signal Integrity group relented, but they were not happy about it. They said the project would be a failure, and we would have flaky behavior of the system because we cut corners, in their opinion. Meanwhile I was waking up at 4AM on most days, in full-stress-insomnia. Sometimes I would just give up on sleep and go into work at that early hour, and while there, sometimes run into other stressed-out engineers who also could not sleep. I had shaved as much time as I could possibly get off the schedule, and a little cost. A $25K bonus was out of the question at this point, but $10K or more, still in the running.</p><p>    信号完整性组有所关注，但它们对此并不乐于幸福。他们表示，该项目将是一个失败，我们将具有系统的片状行为，因为我们在他们看来。与此同时，我大多数日子都在凌晨4点醒来，在全面的心血炎中。有时我会放弃睡眠，在那个早期的时间里去上班，而在那里有时会遇到其他强调的工程师，他们也无法入睡。我已经剃了一下尽可能多的时间，因为我可能下的时间表，以及一点成本。在这一点上，25,000美元的奖金已经存在，但在运行中，仍然是10k或以上的问题。</p><p> Finally the day came when our new hardware came off of the assembly line and was ready for testing. A junior engineer named Mike who was assigned to work with me and I drove up to our Salem, New Hampshire manufacturing plant that had just built Alpha XL366 CPU card number 0001. We met our projects head manufacturing engineer as he was taking our card off the line. He plugged it into a test backplane, and connected a keyboard and monitor. A copy of Windows NT was loaded into the system, and it sprang to life. A huge wave of relief washed over me as he booted the OS, and opened the Solitaire game app.</p><p> 最后，当我们的新硬件从装配线中出现并准备进行测试时，这一天发生了这一天。一个名叫迈克的初级工程师被分配到我和我开车到我们的塞勒姆，新的汉普郡制造工厂刚刚建造了Alpha XL366 CPU卡号0001.我们遇到了我们的项目头制造工程师，因为他正在拍摄我们的卡线。他将其插入测试背板，并连接键盘和显示器。将Windows NT副本加载到系统中，并跳过生命。当他启动操作系统时，一大堆救济就冲了在我身上，并打开了Solitaire游戏应用程序。</p><p> Everything was working perfectly. Luck was with us that day, because our manufacturing friend played that game to completion, and as is the usual when you win at Windows Solitaire, the cards bounced around for the victory screen. On this machine, the speed was so fast that the animation was just a blur, a really good sign we had a performance leader on our hands.</p><p> 一切都是完美的。那天运气与我们在一起，因为我们的制造业朋友播放了这个游戏完成，当你在Windows Solitaire赢得胜利时，通常是通常的，所以卡片击败了胜利屏幕。在这款机器上，速度太快，动画只是一个模糊，我们手里的表演领导者非常好。 </p><p> Creating a design that works first time is not an easy thing, and I came back from that trip riding high, and the bonus situation was looking great. But the luck was not to last. A week later, we received ten complete systems to our lab in Maynard for testing, and that’s when things went down hill. Machines started crashing. At random times, for no apparent reason. Not just one or two that could be explained as a manufacturing defect, but all of them.</p><p>创建一个设计第一次的设计并不是一件容易的事情，而且我从那次骑行之旅回来，奖金情况看起来很棒。但运气不是持续的。一周后，我们在Maynard的实验室中收到了十个完整的系统进行了测试，而且事情陷入困境。机器开始崩溃。在随机的时间，无需明显的原因。不仅仅是一个或两个可以作为制造业缺陷解释，但所有这些都可以解释。</p><p> Out came the oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, component specs, and schematics. Mike and I spent days trying to chase down the phantom problem in the lab, without much assistance from our signal integrity team. As far they were concerned, it was because we didn’t listen to them and did not add in all the capacitors they wanted, and they were very vocal about sharing that opinion. Trouble was though, we didn’t really see any power fluctuations that would have been a telltale for that kind of design flaw. But we also couldn’t find a better explanation for why these systems were failing.</p><p> 来自示波器，逻辑分析仪，组件规格和原理图。迈克和我花了几天试图追逐实验室的幻象问题，没有我们的信号完整性团队的帮助。他们毫无疑问，它是因为我们没有听他们，并没有在他们想要的所有电容中添加，而且他们对分享这一意见非常有声乐。虽然麻烦，我们并没有真正看到任何电力波动，这将是这种设计缺陷的特色。但我们也找不到对为什么这些系统失败的更好的解释。</p><p>  Days turned into weeks, and we watched our theoretical bonus amount tick down, ever smaller. There were whispers in the hallway about how we had blown it with our design, and I was pretty sure that I was going to be removed as project lead if the design had to be restarted. If not something worse.</p><p>  日子变成了几周，我们观看了我们的理论奖金金额下降，更小。走廊里有耳语关于我们如何用我们的设计吹它，我很确定我将被删除，因为设计必须重新开始设计。如果没有更糟糕的事情。</p><p> One gloomy afternoon as Mike and I were sitting in the lab, he asked me to hand him the component specs for the memory chip we used for the CPU card cache. He was going to double-check (or at this point quadruple-check) our pinout and wiring. As he read the spec, he suddenly bolted up out of his seat, and thrust the book at me.  “THESE ARE FIVE-VOLT CHIPS!” he shouted. He pointed excitedly to the board.  “MANUFACTURING INSTALLED FIVE-VOLT RAMS!” I grabbed the book and looked, and it was true. The issue with there being five volt rams on our board was, the power supplied to these chips was three volts, not five. Our design was made to power a variant of the chip that could run on three volts, but the board apparently had the wrong chips installed on it.</p><p> 一个阴沉的下午作为迈克和我坐在实验室里，他让我向他手为我们用于CPU卡缓存的内存芯片的组件规范。他要仔细检查（或在这一点Quadruple-Check）我们的引脚和接线。当他读的规格时，他突然猛地从他的座位上伸出来，并将这本书推向我身边。 “这些是五伏芯片！”他喊道。他兴奋地指着董事会。 “制造安装了五伏RAM！”我抓住了这本书，看了，这是真的。我们董事会上有五个伏勒斯的问题是，提供给这些芯片的电源是三伏，而不是五个。我们的设计是为了为可以在三伏上运行的芯片的变种，但是电路板显然有错误的芯片。</p><p> The other interesting thing about this situation was, if you tried to power something that wants five volts with only three, it will work. Kind of. But it will be flaky, and eventually do weird things when stressed. Which was exactly what was happening here. So we checked the parts list of what we sent to manufacturing, and we had correctly specified three-volt components, but somehow they had picked the wrong, five-volt component stock during assembly.</p><p> 关于这种情况的另一个有趣的事情是，如果你试图为只有三个伏特的东西供电，它将起作用。有点儿。但它将是片状的，最终在压力时会奇怪的事情。这正是在这里发生的事情。因此，我们检查了我们发送到制造的零件清单，我们已经正确指定了三伏元件，但不知何故，他们在组装期间挑选了错误的五伏元件库存。</p><p> I went rushing to my boss to tell him the news, and he was as relieved as I, because he was also taking considerable heat for the delays. We told Signal Integrity the good news (or for them, maybe bad news) next, and I can say I’ve never felt so vindicated about something as on that day. Manufacturing was third, and we had to send the boards back to them to be reworked with new chips.</p><p> 我赶紧赶到老板告诉他这个消息，他和我一样宽慰，因为他也为延误带来了相当大的热量。我们告诉信号完整性好消息（或者他们，也许是坏消息）接下来，我可以说我从来没有觉得这么多对那一天的事情。制造业是第三，我们不得不将董事会送回他们以重新加工新的芯片。</p><p> Then we waited. Because manufacturing, as discussed, was not on the secret bonus program, did not even know it existed, and had very little incentive to speed up the rework. As far as they were concerned the project was slightly ahead of schedule, so why rush the job and make another mistake? More time ticked by. They actually did make another mistake anyway, and mounted incorrect rams a second time, which I remember being really mad about.</p><p> 然后我们等了。因为如讨论的制造业没有关于秘密奖金计划，所以甚至没有知道它存在，并且迅速加快返工很少的动力。就他们而言，该项目略先提前，所以为什么赶紧这份工作并犯错误？更多的时间挑剔。他们实际上确实犯了另一个错误，第二次登上了不正确的公羊，我记得真的很生气。 </p><p> In the end they got it right, but it brought our project only to about a week ahead of original schedule, and maybe 5% under cost. They held a little secret bonus award meeting, and we found that we each would be receiving a bonus total of $2000. Meanwhile, our sister project had managed to minimize their cost target and beat the target schedule of their project, such that each member of that team received the full $25,000.</p><p>最后，他们得到了正确的，但它将我们的项目带到了大约一周之前的原始时间表，也许是5％的成本。他们举行了一点秘密奖金奖励会议，我们发现我们每个人都会收到2000美元的奖金。同时，我们的姐妹项目已设法尽量减少其成本目标并击败其项目的目标时间表，使该团队的每个成员收到了25,000美元。</p><p> We were all furious. Furious about the sweat, tears, and most likely blood shed for this project over the past months, only to have what had turned from a bonus into an entitlement in our minds, taken away. Furious about the inequity of it all, about others making so much more money, even though we worked equally hard. I refused to attend the celebration event following, and was even on the phone with a tech recruiter, looking to see what our competitors would offer me if I went to work for them.</p><p> 我们都很愤怒。对过去几个月来说，对这个项目的血液流血的愤怒，只是让奖金从奖金转变为我们思想的权利，带走。对这一切的不公平感到愤怒，关于其他人的赚得更多的钱，即使我们同样艰难地工作。我拒绝参加庆祝活动之后，甚至与技术招聘人员在电话中，希望看到我们的竞争对手会给我提供什么，如果我去为他们工作。</p><p> Then I stepped back, for a moment. What was happening here? I tried to imagine how an interview would go with a hypothetical new employer:</p><p> 然后我退后一会儿。在这里发生了什么？我试图想象面试如何使用假设的新雇主：</p><p>       “THEM: $25,000? Seems like a lot. Is this what you expect you will get from us as a bonus, if we ever give you one?”</p><p>       “他们：25,000美元？看起来很多。这是你期望的，如果我们给你一个，你会从我们那里得到奖金吗？“</p><p>  I’d worked for ten years for DEC, and although it paid well, it wasn’t the reason I liked the company. I liked the job, I liked the work. The money was never the thing. I found myself surprised that it took a test like this for me to realize it. So in the end, I got over it, didn’t quit, and life went on.</p><p>  我在十二年度工作了十年，虽然它得到了很好的报酬，但这不是我喜欢公司的原因。我喜欢这份工作，我喜欢这项工作。这笔钱永远不会是这件事。我发现自己惊讶地让我对我来说是这样的测试来实现它。所以到底，我克服了它，没有戒烟，生活继续下去。</p><p> A tall, blonde Irish guy (also named Mike) who was a mischievous sort, conspired with me to get one last bit of revenge on the Signal Integrity group. At yet another recognition meeting for the project, we built a special award we called the “Faraday Award”. (Farads are units used to measure capacitance, named after  Michael Faraday.) The award was to commemorate the most capacitors added to a board, and it featured a giant, beer-can-sized capacitor from a 1950s TV mounted on top of an old bowling trophy. We tried to give this to the head of the Signal Integrity group, but he got wind of it and was a no-show. Not much of a sense of humor over there, we guessed.</p><p> 一个高大的金发女郎爱尔兰人（也命名迈克）是一个恶作剧的莫克里，并与我联系在于，在信号完整性组上获得最后的复仇。在该项目的另一个认可会议上，我们建立了一项特别奖项，我们称之为“法拉第奖”。 （Farads是用于测量电容的单位，以Michael Faraday命名。）该奖项是纪念加入电路板的最电容器，它特征在于20世纪50年代电视的巨型啤酒可以大小的电容器，安装在旧的20世纪50年代电视台保龄球奖杯。我们试图将其推向信号完整性组的头部，但他有它的风，是一个禁令。我们猜到了那里的幽默感并不多。</p><p> Was it vindictive? Perhaps. Not sure the current me would have done it, but the 1996 me sure did. It brought a sense of closure. I stayed at the company another year, until it was bought out by Compaq Computer and Intel. Then I finally parted ways with my first job, and my hardware design career, forever.</p><p> 是报复吗？也许。不确定当前我会做到它，但是1996年我肯定的是。它带来了一个关闭感。我又待在了公司，直到它被Compaq Computer和Intel购买了。然后我终于用我的第一份工作分手，以及我的硬件设计职业生涯。 </p><p>    This is where this story should end, but there is one small bit of Epilogue, that really puts everything in perspective for me. It turns out that management did have some concerns about creating an incentive program that not everyone on the project knew about or was part of. Not enough to include the missing people mind you, and not enough to avoid doing the bonus program in the first place.</p><p>这是这个故事应该结束的地方，但是有一小一点的脱果，这真的把一切都放在了对我的角度。事实证明，管理层确实有些担心创建一个不是项目上的每个人都知道或者是一部分的令人担忧。不足以包括失踪的人，不足以避免首先做奖金计划。</p><p> What they did do was, reserve a small portion of the incentive fund, about $20,000, that was to be given out to ‘support staff’ on the project. These people were the lab techs, manufacturing people, PCB layout designers and others who worked on the project with us in a supporting role. The managers told the R&amp;D staff to nominate people to get this much smaller bonus, and pick and amount for each. The numbers here were in the realm of $200-$500 a person. Again, these people were unaware of the bigger bonus program, and also unaware that they were about to get a smaller bonus from the pool.</p><p> 他们所做的是，预约一小部分激励基金，约有20,000美元，即在项目上“支持人员”。这些人是实验室技术，制造人员，PCB布局设计师和其他在项目上工作的其他人的支持作用。管理者告诉R＆amp; D的工作人员提名人员获得更小的奖金，并为每个人提供挑选和金额。这里的数字是200美元的境界。同样，这些人不知道更大的奖金计划，也没有意识到他们即将获得池中的较小奖金。</p><p> So when we handed out this money, it was a complete surprise to them. They expected nothing further from the project, they had been paid for their time, and the project was a success by all accounts, in terms of targets and schedule. And when they received that small stipend of cash, they were delighted. They had not expected it, and it was as pure a definition of a bonus as could be, not an entitlement, just a pleasant surprise.</p><p> 所以当我们发布这笔钱时，对他们来说是一个完全惊喜。他们预计从项目中进一步进一步，他们已经为他们的时间付出了报酬，并且该项目在目标和时间表方面是所有账户的成功。当他们收到的那些现金的小阶级时，他们很高兴。他们没想到它，这是一个纯粹的奖金定义，而不是一个令人愉快的惊喜。</p><p> A few days after that, I received an email from a layout tech who had done the printed circuit routing work on my CPU card design. She thanked me for having her on the project, and for the bonus money, and said it was one of her best project experiences at DEC. The guilt I felt after that, and shame even for my behavior, well it was real.</p><p> 几天之后，我收到了一封来自布局技术的电子邮件，他们在CPU卡设计上完成了印刷电路路由工作。她感谢我在项目上有她，并为奖金，并表示是她在DEC的最佳项目经历之一。我觉得在那之后的内疚，即使是我的行为，也很羞耻，这是真的。</p><p> I’ve received all sorts of different bonuses and awards from time to time in the years since, some expected, some not. It’s a common thing in the tech industry to do. But I’ve learned never to take a bonus for granted, even if it is a seemingly regular affair. Never to complain or worry about any amount given to me in this way, to always feel lucky I’m in a position to get one in the first place.</p><p> 从那时起，我收到了各种不同的奖金和奖励，从那时起，一些预期的一些预期，有些没有。这是科技行业的常见问题。但我已经学会了永远不会成为理所当然的奖金，即使这是一个看似经常的事情。从来没有抱怨或担心以这种方式给我的任何金额，总是觉得幸运的是我能够首先得到一个。</p><p> We are lucky enough to have a regular bonus program even now at work, it’s been going on for years. Every time it is handed out my boss will say something like, “so we had a good bonus this time, but don’t count on it in the future.”</p><p> 我们很幸运能够甚至在工作中拥有常规奖金计划，这已经开始了。每当它发出我的老板都会说出来的东西，“所以我们这次得到了一个良好的奖金，但在未来并不依赖它。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://madned.substack.com/p/thanks-for-the-bonus-i-quit">https://madned.substack.com/p/thanks-for-the-bonus-i-quit</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/奖金/">#奖金</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/bonus/">#bonus</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
