One way might be to ask those who are dying. They might occupy a perspective that allows them to see better what’s trivial and what’s truly significant. The prospect of imminent death might carry them above petty squabbles and the pursuit of money and status, and allow them a clear view of the goods that make our lives worthwhile.</p><p>我们如何了解生活中真正重要的是什么？一种方法可能会问那些正在死去的人。他们可能会占据一个透视，让他们能够看到更好的是微不足道的并且真正重要的东西。即将死亡的前景可能使它们高于小幅争吵和追求金钱和地位，并允许他们清楚地看待使我们的生活有价值的商品。</p><p> What  really matters, it turns out, is family and relationships and authenticity. At least, that’s what people apparently report from the deathbed. There’s very little systematic research on this question, but there’s some  unsystematic research. Search the internet for ‘regrets of the dying’ and chances are you’ll quickly hit upon a website or a newspaper article reporting the work of Bronnie Ware, an Australian former nurse whose blog recording bedside conversations became the basis for a bestselling  book. According to her, the dying expressed five common regrets:</p><p> 事实证明，真正重要的是家庭和关系和真实性。至少，这就是人们显然从死亡中报告的内容。对这个问题有很少的系统研究，但有一些不系统的研究。在互联网上寻找“濒临死亡”和机会的机会，您将迅速击中网站或报纸文章报告Bronnie Ware的工作，这是一个澳大利亚前护士的工作，其博客记录床边对话成为畅销书的基础。根据她，垂死表达了五个常见的遗憾：</p><p> I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.</p><p> 我希望我有勇气过自己的生活，而不是对我所期望的其他人的生活。</p><p> Broadly, people seem to wish for a more meaningful life. They wished they’d been more authentic in their activities  (1; 3). They wished they’d prioritised friends and themselves, rather than work  (2; 4; 5). They wished, in short, that they’d stopped and smelled the roses.</p><p> 广泛地说，人们似乎希望有一个更有意义的生活。他们希望他们在他们的活动中更加真实（1; 3）。他们希望他们能够优先考虑朋友和自己，而不是工作（2; 4; 5）。简而言之，他们希望他们停止并闻到了玫瑰。</p><p> Along with almost everyone else, I find it plausible that these things are very valuable, and that they’re components (though  far from the only ones) of a meaningful life. But I’m not convinced that the reported regrets of the dying provide us with reasons to think them valuable. I’m sceptical, first, of the reports themselves. There are various cultural pressures that might lead people to report such regrets, whether they feel them or not, and might lead us to attribute them to the dying, whether they report them or not. Second and more importantly, I doubt that the perspective of the dying gives them a clearer view on what really matters. There are reasons to think that the view from the deathbed is  worse, not better, than the view from the midst of life. Their lack of engagement in ongoing projects might leave them with an impoverished sense of their value.</p><p> 除了几乎所有人之外，我发现这些东西都是非常有价值的合议，而且它们是一个有意义的生活的组成部分（虽然远离唯一的人）。但我并不相信，垂死的遗憾为我们提供了理由认为他们有价值。我是持怀疑态度，首先是报告本身。有各种文化压力可能导致人们报告这种遗憾，无论他们感受到它们，也可能导致我们将他们归因于垂死，无论他们是否报告他们。第二个，更重要的是，我怀疑的角度对他们来说更清楚地了解真正重要的。有理由认为从死亡的灭亡中的视图比生命中间的视野更糟糕。他们在持续的项目中缺乏参与可能会使他们带来贫困的价值感。</p><p> I’m not the first person to wonder whether deathbed regrets are epistemically privileged. The American philosopher  Eric Schwitzgebel gives two  reasons why we should be cautious in giving them significant weight. First, the dying might be subject to hindsight bias, in the form of a tendency to assume that their current epistemic perspective looking back on the past is identical to the perspective they should have adopted at the time. Take the advice that people should prioritise fulfilment over money. That advice is easier to find compelling from the perspective of the financially comfortable present self than it is from the perspective of the worried past self, struggling to make ends meet. Even if the person who offers the advice was herself once poor, she might easily romanticise the past, in part because memories of day-to-day life tend to be crowded out by memories of peak moments. Perhaps I recall my time of relative poverty as better than it really was, because I remember dancing to the radio in the kitchen and not struggling to pay the bills. My biased recollection could easily lead me to underestimate how much money really mattered to a decent life.</p><p> 我不是第一个想知道被死亡的遗憾是否是认识的。美国哲学家埃里克·施韦茨贝尔给出了两个原因，为什么我们应该谨慎给予它们重量。首先，垂死可能受到后视偏见的影响，以倾向于假设他们目前的认识视角回顾过去的视角是与当时应该采用的视角相同。采取人们应优先考虑履行的建议。从经济舒适的现在自我的角度来看，这种建议更容易找到引人注目，而不是担心过去自我的视角，努力使结束会面。即使提供咨询的人曾经是穷人，她也可能很容易浪漫过去，部分原因是日常生活的记忆往往被高峰时刻的回忆挤出。也许我回忆起我的相对贫困的时间，因为它真的好，因为我记得在厨房里的收音机跳舞而不是努力支付账单。我偏见的回忆可能很容易引导我低估了对体面生活的多少钱。</p><p> Schwitzgebel’s second reason for wariness about deathbed regrets arises from the fact that the dying escape the consequences of their advice. They don’t risk accusations of hypocrisy if they fail to live up to it, because they can’t be expected to try. This lack of a stake in their advice might free them to fantasise, in a way that those of us who are called to live up to our own advice can’t. For that reason, Schwitzgebel suggests that we might do better to prefer the wisdom of  40-somethings: those who have experienced enough to have a broad perspective on life, but who still have a stake in living.</p><p> Schwitzgebel对死亡遗憾的第二次令人遗憾的原因是垂死的事实逃避了他们建议的后果。如果他们未能辜负它，他们就不会冒着虚伪的指责，因为他们不能预期尝试。这种缺乏威胁他们的建议可能会让他们幻想幻想，以便我们被召唤达到自己的建议的人不能。因此，Schwitzgebel表明我们可能更喜欢40-某事物的智慧：那些经历了足够广阔的生活的人，但仍有威胁生活。 </p><p> While these concerns are significant, they don’t seem sufficient to eliminate any sense that the view from the deathbed is epistemically privileged. For one thing, the status of the (so-called) hindsight bias is contested: as the Australian philosopher Brian Hedden has  argued, in hindsight we often have a better grasp of what our total evidence at the time actually was, and what propositions it actually supported. The objection that the dying are suspiciously free of the need to abide by their own advice seems to generalise too broadly: we often, and apparently appropriately, seek advice from people who we know won’t follow it themselves, because they won’t face the problems we face (we go to celibate priests for advice on marriage problems, for example). Together these concerns could give us reason for downgrading deathbed advice to some degree, but they’re compatible with thinking that it nevertheless has special epistemic weight.</p><p>虽然这些担忧很重要，但它们似乎没有足以消除任何感觉，即死亡的视图是认识的。一方面，（所谓的）后古偏见的国家是有争议的：随着澳大利亚哲学家Brian Hedden所说，在后代，我们常常更好地把握我们当时的总证据实际上是什么，以及什么主张实际支持。垂死的反对意见无疑是不需要遵守自己的建议，似乎概括了：我们经常宣传，并且显然是适当的，寻求我们所知道不会追随它的人的建议，因为他们不会面对例如，我们面临的问题（我们去Selibate Priess有关婚姻问题的建议）。这些担忧可以让我们在某种程度上向我们降级死亡建议的原因，但它们仍然认为它仍然存在特殊的认识体重。</p><p> We can reinforce Schwitzgebel’s scepticism with a third worry. The regrets of the dying are platitudes, taken-for-granted pieces of folk wisdom, and that very fact is grounds for wondering about their sincerity and about their representativeness.</p><p> 我们可以通过第三次担心加强施韦茨贝尔的怀疑论者。垂死的遗憾是陈词滥调，被取得的民间智慧作出了象征，这一事实是为了想知道他们的诚意以及他们的代表性的理由。</p><p>  Ware’s  The Top Five Regrets of the Dying (2012) gives us ‘anecdata’, not carefully collected evidence. We don’t know how broad a range of patients she saw in her ‘several years’ in palliative care. It probably wasn’t especially broad, since she worked for an agency that provided help in the homes of those who could afford such services. Nor do we know how systematically she has reported the regrets she heard. Perhaps certain things struck her more forcefully than others, and she was more likely to remember them. Beyond these considerations, there are reasons to worry that both what was actually said to her and what she recalls being said were shaped by expectations and cultural pressures of various sorts.</p><p>  Ware是垂死（2012）的前五名遗憾给了我们“轶事”，而不是仔细收集的证据。我们不知道她在她在姑息治疗中看到的一系列患者的广泛患者。它可能并没有特别广泛，因为她为一个提供了那些能够负担此类服务的人的家园提供帮助的机构。我们也不知道她如何系统地报告了她所听到的遗憾。也许某些事情比其他事情更有力量，她更有可能记住它们。除了这些考虑因素之外，有理由担心这两个人对她所说的是，她回忆说是由各种各样的期望和文化压力塑造。</p><p> The top regrets of the dying are suspiciously familiar. It turns out that the dying value exactly the things that our culture tells us all to value: the themes that fill our advertising and magazines. The variously attributed saying ‘No one ever said on their deathbed  I wish I’d spent more time at the office’ and close variations thereof return close to 40,000 hits on Google, indicating how deeply such sentiments resonate with us. That friendship and family and feelings  are valuable is surely part of the reason why we value them. But the everyday banality of the advice gives us reason for suspicion.</p><p> 垂死的顶级遗憾是可疑熟悉的。事实证明，垂死的价值完全是我们文化告诉我们所有人的价值：填补我们广告和杂志的主题。各种各样的归因于“没有人在他们的死亡中说我希望我在办公室花费更多时间”并且在谷歌上休息接近40,000次点击，表明这些情感与我们有多深入共鸣。友谊和家庭和感情是有价值的，这肯定是我们重视它们的原因的一部分。但建议的日常平衡给了我们怀疑的理由。</p><p> The ubiquity of the advice suggests that there’s a cultural script in play here: a set of expectations that shapes what’s said and what’s heard. Perhaps our expectations lead us to fit what the dying say into the established script; perhaps Ware (for instance) turned more ambiguous or noncommittal statements into those she reports, or perhaps she recalls and reports only those that fit the script and ignores (who knows how many?) others that don’t fit. On the other hand, perhaps the script shapes what’s actually said: perhaps her reports are accurate and representative, but they were expressed because these are the kinds of things that one’s supposed to say in this kind of situation. The dying person knows full well that if they say they regret not making more money or not spending more time at the office, they’ll be seen as shallow.</p><p> 这项建议的愚蠢表明，这里有一个文化剧本：一系列期望来塑造所说的和听到的东西。也许我们的期望导致我们适合垂死的剧本;也许洁具（例如）将更多含糊不清或非常规的陈述转变为她报告的那些，或者她只回忆起，只回顾并报告那些适合脚本并忽略的人（谁知道多少？）其他不适合的人。另一方面，也许剧本形状实际上所说的：也许她的报告是准确的，代表性，但他们被表达，因为这些是在这种情况下所说的话语。垂死的人完全了解，如果他们说他们后悔没有做更多的钱或者在办公室里花更多的时间，他们将被视为浅薄。</p><p> If cultural scripts are responsible for what’s reported or what’s remembered, it might well be that these nuggets of wisdom circulate so widely and are repeated so often not because they come from the dying ( if they come from the dying at all): rather, it might be because they’re truisms that are attributed to the dying. If that’s right, the idea that we should give these regrets special weight because they’re expressed by the dying gets things backwards: we attribute these things to the dying because we give them special weight.</p><p> 如果文化剧本负责报告的内容或记住的内容，那么这些智慧的掘金可能会传播如此广泛，并且经常不再是因为它们来自于垂死（如果他们根本来自于死亡）：相反可能是因为他们是归因于死亡的真实性。如果是对的话，我们应该给予这些遗憾的想法，因为它们被垂死的垂死者表示：我们将这些东西归因于垂死，因为我们给予他们特殊的体重。</p><p> What if further research indicates that the dying really do express such regrets, and we found out (somehow) that they genuinely express what really mattered to them at the time that they expressed them? Should we give them special weight under those conditions? I’m still sceptical.</p><p> 如果进一步的研究表明垂死真的表达了这种遗憾，我们发现（不知何故），他们在他们表达他们时真正表达对他们的真正重要性？我们应该在这些条件下给予他们特殊的体重吗？我仍然持怀疑态度。 </p><p> The idea that the perspective from death is epistemically privileged is one with a distinguished philosophical pedigree. Existentialists, in particular, are associated with the idea that holding the fact of our inevitable deaths in mind can help in achieving authenticity. In  Being and Time (1927), Martin Heidegger argues that death individualises us, because at death we cease to be in social relations with others. This, for him, entails that awareness of  my death enables me to grasp my authentic being, while evading contemplation of my death (by assimilating it to the empirical fact of the death of everyone) allows escape into inauthenticity. Other existentialists (eg, Karl Jaspers) developed this kind of thought in slightly different ways.</p><p>从死亡中的观点是认识论特权的想法是一个杰出的哲学血统。特别是存在主义者与举办必然死亡的事实的想法有关，可以帮助实现真实性。在和时间（1927年）中，马丁海德格尔认为，死亡的个体，因为在死亡时，我们不再与他人的社会关系。对他而言，这需要意识到我的死亡让我能够掌握我的真实存在，同时逃避我的死亡（通过吸收到每个人死亡的经验事实）允许逃脱。其他存在主义者（例如，Karl Jaspers）以略微不同的方式开发了这种思想。</p><p> Authenticity consists, more or less, in being true to oneself and to what is distinctive about each of us. It’s an ideal that many of us value. If Heidegger’s right, contemplation of death can give us a route to authenticity. When I’m absorbed by day-to-day concerns, I’m unable to glimpse my authentic self and what matters to  me. If I manage to still the clamour without, perhaps I will better hear the voice within, and perhaps contemplation of death will enable me to hear better. The dying person, no longer distracted by these minutiae, might be in a better position to hear that authentic voice.</p><p> 真实性或多或少地由对自己而且对我们每个人来说是独特的。这是我们许多人的价值。如果海德格尔的权利，则沉思死亡可以向我们提供真实性的路线。当我被日常担忧所吸收的时候，我无法瞥见我的真实的自我和对我而言。如果我设法仍然是喧嚣，也许我会更好地听到语音，也许沉思死亡将使我能够更好地听到。垂死的人，不再被这些细节分散注意力，可能处于更好的地位，以听到真正的声音。</p><p> But the appeal to authenticity, in its standard form, won’t vindicate the thought that the dying have special insight to offer to us. Authenticity is about hearing one’s  own inner voice. Perhaps the dying person is in a better position to see what really matters  for her. Yet there’s no reason to think that her wisdom indicates what matters most  for me. Perhaps, though, the Heideggerian manoeuvre works for values other than authenticity. Perhaps there is a set of goods that are valuable for all – or almost all – of us, and the view from the deathbed helps us grasp them for the same reason it (supposedly) enables us to grasp what matters distinctively for each of us: because we’re no longer distracted by everyday matters.</p><p> 但是，在其标准形式下，对真实性的吸引力不会辩护垂死对我们提供特别洞察的思想。真实性是关于听到自己的内心声音。也许垂死的人处于更好的地位，看看对她来说真正重要。然而，没有理由认为她的智慧表明对我来说最重要的事情。尽管如此，海德格氏机构的机动适用于真实性以外的价值。也许有一套商品对我们的全部或几乎所有人有价值，并且终身的观点有助于我们出于同样的原因（据说）使我们能够掌握对我们每个人的重要事项：因为我们不再被日常事项分散注意力。</p><p> I want to suggest that this thought might have it backwards. The view from the deathbed might be impoverished, not enriched, because it’s outside of everyday concerns.</p><p> 我想表明这一思想可能会向后。从死亡的视图可能会贫穷，而不是丰富，因为它在日常担忧之外。</p><p> Heidegger claims that, when we contemplate our individual death, we emerge from absorption in the everyday. The view from outside everyday life is very different from the view within it, he suggests. That’s plausible, but it doesn’t follow that the view from outside the everyday is more reliable. There are grounds for thinking it’s  less reliable.</p><p> 海德格尔要求，当我们考虑我们的个人死亡时，我们从每天吸收都涌现出来。他建议，来自日常生活之外的视图与其中内的视野非常不同。这是合理的，但它并没有遵循从外部的视图更可靠。有理由认为它不太可靠。</p><p>  From within an ongoing project or enterprise, the stakes not only  look different to how they appear from outside it; they  are different. In an influential  article on the absurd, the American philosopher Thomas Nagel notes that, when we exercise the distinctively human capacity to step back from the life in which we’re immersed and survey that life and ourselves ‘with that detached amazement which comes from watching an ant struggle up a heap of sand’, all justifications for our struggles seem to drop away. Meaning seeps away because taking this crucial step backwards entails stepping back from the kinds of concerns that  constitute reasons for us. It is only from  within our life projects that questions about justification can be answered at all because, in the absence of the commitments that give our struggles meaning, nothing is justified. The view from the deathbed might be the closest we can get to seeing life and its concerns from outside. From outside, we can’t grasp the significance of those concerns, not because they’re not real, but because they’re graspable only from within.</p><p>  从在持续的项目或企业内，赌注不仅看起来与他们出现在外面的不同;他们是不同的。在一个有影响力的荒谬的文章中，美国哲学家托马斯·娜格尔指出，当我们行使鲜明的人类能力时，我们从中居住并调查生命和自己的生活，与之看过的令人惊奇一个蚂蚁挣扎着一堆沙子'，我们斗争的所有理由似乎都掉了下来。意思是Seeps离开，因为追溯到这一关键步骤，因此需要踩到构成我们原因的担忧的各种问题。它只来自我们的生活项目，可以回答关于理由的问题，因为，在没有给予我们挣扎的意义的承诺的情况下，没有任何证据。来自死亡的视图可能是最接近的，我们可以从外面看到生活和担忧。从外面来看，我们无法掌握这些问题的重要性，而不是因为他们不是真实的，而是因为它们只有在内部只掌握。</p><p> Most plans and projects have a significance only for the person who’s confident she’ll live for some time to come. Saving money often makes sense only because there’ll be a later, at which I might need the money. Learning French might make sense only in view of the possibility of a visit to Paris. Planting roses might make sense only if I’ll be around to see them bloom (of course, people plant things for their children or even for strangers – trees are a storied example – but even this sort of planting often depends on having some kind of personal future, because the sapling might need care before it can survive on its own). Even starting a book, or a box set, is an enterprise that could require confidence in a personal future to make sense. You’re not going to start reading Leo Tolstoy’s 1,392-page novel  War and Peace (1867) if you know you have just  24 hours to live. You won’t even start watching  Game of Thrones.</p><p> 大多数计划和项目对于那些自信的人来说，只有她会过一段时间的人有重要意义。储蓄往往是有道理的，因为它会在后来，我可能需要钱。鉴于访问巴黎的可能性，学习法国人可能只有意义。种植玫瑰才能才有意义，只有我会在盛开的时候（当然，人们为他们的孩子种植东西甚至陌生人 - 树是一个杂志的例子 - 但即使这种种植常常依赖于有某种个人未来，因为树苗可能在自己生存之前需要注意。甚至开始书籍或一个盒子集，是一个可能需要对个人未来有信心的企业。如果您知道您只需24小时，您就不会开始阅读Leo Tolstoy的1,392页的新战争与和平（1867）。你甚至不会开始观看宝座的游戏。 </p><p> Once you know your death is imminent, extended plans and projects cease to have a grip on you as valuable activities; valuable  for you. On the deathbed, only a narrower, more immediate, set of commitments continues to have significance. When we know that we lack a personal future, we find ourselves external to the system of justification that underwrites longer-term projects. We still understand them, but now we see them from the outside. Finding ourselves on the outside of the frames of justification that underwrite these projects, the passionate commitment of others to them seems absurd, like the ant’s struggle does to Nagel. The view from the deathbed is a perspective that has shed important sources of meaning.</p><p>一旦你知道你的死亡是即将来临的，扩大的计划和项目停止掌握你作为宝贵的活动;对你有价值。在终审中，只有更窄，更直接的承诺继续具有重要意义。当我们知道我们缺乏个人未来时，我们发现自己对涉及长期项目的理由制度外部。我们仍然明白他们，但现在我们从外面看到它们。在宪法的框架外，找到自己的框架外，别人对他们的热情承诺看起来荒谬，就像蚂蚁的斗争那样对娜格尔做了。来自死亡的视图是一个透视，揭示了重要的意义来源。</p><p> If that’s right, the view from the deathbed  is epistemically distinctive. It’s the perspective of someone who is embedded in a simpler set of commitments: for whom simpler pleasures – those that can be realised immediately, or come to fruition relatively quickly – retain their grip, but for whom broader commitments are absurd. The view from the deathbed comes as close as is humanly possible (for those who aren’t deeply depressed) to abandoning the sets of commitments that give more extended projects meaning. It’s not because the deathbed is epistemically privileged that diachronic projects look meaningless. It’s because the perspective lacks the temporal horizon that makes sense of them. These projects lack meaning because their meaning is graspable only from within. They’re still meaningful, even if those who lack a future can’t sympathise with them.</p><p> 如果这是对的，那么来自死亡的视图就是认识学上独特的。这是一个嵌入更简单的承诺的人的视角：为谁更简单的乐趣 - 那些可以立即实现的人，或者相对迅速地实现成果 - 保留他们的抓地力，但为谁荒谬而言。来自死亡的视图与人类可能的（对于那些没有深入沮丧的人）来放弃提供更多扩展项目意义的承诺。这不是因为死亡的历史宣称，历史压缩项目看起来毫无意义。这是因为透视缺乏对它们有意义的时间的地平线。这些项目缺乏意义，因为他们的意义只能从内部掌握。他们仍然有意义，即使那些缺乏未来的人不能同情他们。</p><p> In his recent  book on the midlife crisis, the American philosopher  Kieran Setiya argues that these crises can arise because, as we complete our projects, they lose their meaning for us. These projects are  telic: they have a goal, and it’s our commitment to this goal that makes them meaningful to us. Once we’ve achieved that goal, they come to seem absurd. Setiya counsels us to ward off the midlife crisis by finding value in the  atelic: in activities that don’t have a goal beyond themselves (going for a walk for the sake of it, rather than to get somewhere, for example). Whatever the merits of his solution to the problem that he sees midlife as posing, Setiya’s distinction is a helpful one. Telic pursuits are diachronic; atelic are not, or not necessarily. From midlife, when those of us who are lucky have achieved some of our goals, these telic pursuits seem pointless and absurd. But we remain in the midst of life and have to find a way to recommit to ongoing projects (Setiya recommends finding value in the moment, in the atelic aspects of our telic activities).</p><p> 在他最近的中年危机的书中，美国哲学家Kieran Setiya认为这些危机可以出现，因为我们完成了我们的项目，他们对我们失去了意义。这些项目是电视：他们有一个目标，这是我们对这一目标的承诺，使他们对我们有意义。一旦我们达到了这个目标，他们就会似乎荒谬。 Setiya劝告我们通过在内部的价值来抵御中午危机：在没有超越自己的活动的活动中（为了散步而是为了它，而不是为了在某个地方）。无论他解决中期地区的问题，他解决了他的解决方案的优点，所以Setiya的区别是有用的。电视追求是历时的; atelic不是，或不一定。从中年生动，当我们幸运的人已经取得了一些目标时，这些电视追求看起来毫无意义和荒谬。但我们留在生命中，必须找到推荐项目的方法（Setiya建议在我们的电视活动的Atelic方面的瞬间找到价值）。</p><p> At each life stage, we face a different mix of telic and atelic activities. These activities are meaning-conferring for us; they  constitute what’s valuable. Perhaps the perspective from the deathbed authentically reflects what matters for those who are forced to withdraw from ongoing activities, in view of their foreshortened temporal horizon, and what has value for them. But their wisdom doesn’t illuminate what has value for those lucky enough to be able to continue to engage in worthwhile telic activities. From outside the telic, only the atelic (or the pursuit of very short-term goals) retains meaning. Companionship, contemplation, beauty… they remain available to the dying and take on extra force. But their perspective is partial. Perhaps from the deathbed certain goods are grasped especially forcefully, but others slip away entirely. It’s not because these commitments lack value that they’re seen as pallid or pointless; it’s because their value can be fully grasped only from the inside.</p><p> 在每个生命阶段，我们面对不同的电视和休息活动。这些活动对我们有意义 - 赋予了意义;他们构成了有价值的东西。也许来自死亡的观点是真实地反映了那些被迫退出正在进行的活动的人的重要性，鉴于他们的倒闭的颞型地平线，以及它们有价值。但他们的智慧不会阐明这些幸运能力的价值，以便能够继续参与有价值的电视活动。从电视外面，只有与房屋（或追求非常短期的目标）保留了意义。友谊，沉思，美......他们仍然可以垂死并采取额外的力量。但他们的观点是部分。也许来自死亡的某些商品特别有力地掌握，但其他人完全溜走了。这不是因为这些承诺缺乏价值，他们被视为苍白或毫无意义;这是因为它们的价值只能从内部完全掌握。</p><p> To read more on life, death and meaning, visit   Psyche , a digital magazine from Aeon that illuminates the human condition through psychological knowhow, philosophical understanding and artistic insight.</p><p> 阅读更多关于生命，死亡和意义，访问灵魂，来自AEON的数字杂志，通过心理知识，哲学理解和艺术洞察力照亮人类状况。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-is-the-deathbed-perspective-considered-so-valuable">https://aeon.co/essays/why-is-the-deathbed-perspective-considered-so-valuable</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/价值/">#价值</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/死亡/">#死亡</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
