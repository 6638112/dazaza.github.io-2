crater on our planet\u2019s surface.\n   Boltysh crater, a 15-mile-wide formation in central Ukraine, may not be as famous as the Chicxulub crater under the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico, which is directly implicated in the death of the dinosaurs and many other species about 66 million years ago. Nevertheless, Boltysh has long led to debate among scientists. Some have suggested that the crater, which is buried under more than 1,000 feet of sediment, could have formed before or after the Chicxulub event, making its role in this cataclysmic period unclear.\n Now, a team led by Annemarie Pickersgill, a research associate at the University of Glasgow, estimates that Boltysh formed about 650,000 years after the Chicxulub catastrophe. The refined age has implications for understanding how Boltysh affected this tumultuous time, and can shed light on our own era of sudden climate change.\n For  a study published on Friday in Science Advances, the researchers performed a technique known as argon-argon dating with rocks extracted from Boltysh. They also analyzed specimens from a geological layer in Montana, the K-Pg boundary, that marks the dramatic transition wrought by the Chicxulub impact. This comparative approach, along with advances in radiometric dating methods, yielded a more refined sequence of events than previous studies.\n \u201cIt\u2019s the first comparison of Boltysh samples directly to K-Pg boundary samples,\u201d Dr. Pickersgill said. \u201cBecause we analyzed everything under the same experimental conditions, we could neglect a lot of the uncertainties that we would get if, say, one lab had analyzed the K-Pg boundary and a different lab had analyzed Boltysh.\u201d\n The new age estimate places Boltysh about a half-million years after the dinosaur-killing asteroid, contradicting the conclusions of  a 2010 study in Geology that dated it to a few thousand years before Chicxulub. The researchers who wrote that paper embraced the new findings, and some became co-authors of Dr. Pickersgill\u2019s study.\n \u201cThe guys who did the previous work, who ended up being my collaborators, are really good scientists,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I came up with an answer that apparently conflicted with their results, I was surprised and somewhat alarmed. But we double-checked everything and the data is what it is.\u201d\n \u201cIt was a very nice science experience for me because they were so happy to adopt the new hypothesis and come up with new interpretations,\u201d she added.\n  For years, scientists  speculated that the Boltysh and Chicxulub impactors may have acted as a one-two punch that shattered life at the end of the Cretaceous period. The revised age suggests that the impact that made the Ukrainian crater did not factor into the apocalyptic die-off of the dinosaurs, though it may have interfered with the recovery from the mass extinction.\n Dr. Pickersgill\u2019s team raises the possibility that Boltysh could be linked to a warming event, called the lower C29N hyperthermal, which occurred around the same time, though confirming that relationship would require more substantial evidence.\n Sean Gulick, a geophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin, said that the new age for Boltysh appeared sound, but that he doubted the impact had any connection to the coincident hyperthermal or the pace of recovery from the extinction.\n \u201cThis is an important study\u201d that can help \u201cunravel this question about whether smaller events have had major climate effects or not,\u201d Dr. Gulick said.\n \u201cI think in this case, the evidence would be that it didn\u2019t, necessarily,\u201d he added. \u201cBut the only way we can figure that out is if you get these really precise dates.\u201d\n Pinpointing these connections not only opens a window into Earth\u2019s ancient history, but it can also help us prepare for modern human-driven climate change.\n \u201cMany of my colleagues are paleoclimatologists \u2014 they\u2019re studying the effects of climate in the past \u2014 and the reason they\u2019re doing that is out of nerdiness, but also to understand what\u2019s happening to the climate right now,\u201d Dr. Pickersgill said.\n Ken Amor, a geochemist at the University of Oxford, also emphasized the importance of assessing the risk of Boltysh-scale impactors striking Earth. Chicxulub-level impacts appear to be extremely rare \u201cBlack Swan events,\u201d he said, but our planet is vulnerable to smaller objects, like the roughly one-mile-wide impactor that produced Boltysh.\n \u201cSomething like that falling on London or Paris or somewhere would just totally wipe it out,\u201d Dr. Amor said. \u201cThe chances of that happening on human time scales is quite small, but there does always remain that possibility.\u201d\n He added that one way to build on the new study was to collect more samples from Boltysh and other impact craters to further refine their ages and the properties of the objects that created them.

I really wanted to keep this as quiet as possible, but I don&#39;t feel I can anymore. Here&#39;s my side of what happened.  On an exchange like MtGox, there are typically hundreds of standing &#34;buy orders&#34; where people are offering to buy bitcoins at various amounts and prices. When a large sell order comes in, an exchange will start with the highest priced buy order, match up the buyer and seller, then move down to the next lowest buy order. This repeats until the entire quantity of bitcoins being sold have found buyers, or there are no more buyers at the minimum price the seller was willing to accept.  I was watching, like many of you, a gigantic sell order burning through the bids. Mt Gox doesn&#39;t execute trades very quickly, so we were watching this huge order slowly eat up every buy order on the books. The price started at around $17.50, and within minutes was below $10. At this point, I realized this wasn&#39;t merely a large seller willing to accept some losses. This was someone attempting to crash the market by selling a huge percentage of the market&#39;s total bitcoins at once.  I had around $3000 USD in my Mt Gox account, from earlier sales I&#39;d made. I looked at the market stats, and realized that there were tons of orders to buy BTC at $0.01 that would likely eat up any remaining bitcoins this seller had on the order. I figured if I put a buy order in for $0.0101, my order would execute first and I could buy a huge amount of bitcoins from this seller before it hit the bottom. The only problem was that Mt Gox was running slower than molasses at the time, and everyone was saying that it wasn&#39;t accepting trades. I had to try several times, but eventually I got a buy order in, offering to buy as many bitcoins as I could for $0.0101.  The site stopped responding completely for a while, probably from so many people hitting refresh to see what was going on. When I got back in, I saw in my account:   06/19/11 17:51\u00a0 Bought BTC\u00a0 259684.77 for 0.0101  I had just purchased over 250,000 bitcoins for $2613. At the trading price immediately before this large sell order happened, that number would have been worth nearly $5 million. After I regained my breath, I tried to figure out what to do. I wasn&#39;t sure what was really going on. Over the past few days there had been a lot of talk and complaints about Mt Gox&#39;s security. Lists of Mt Gox usernames, email addresses and encrypted passwords were being traded around, which was an obvious sign that security at Mt Gox had been breached in some way. If there was an attacker in the system, perhaps he was able to log into my account now and force my account to execute some other crazy trade.  I attempted to withdraw the bitcoin balance into my own wallet, and hit the limit that Mt Gox has, preventing you from withdrawing more than $1000 USD worth of bitcoins (at the current market value) in a day. This transferred 643.27 bitcoins to my personal bitcoin account before hitting that limit. It was pretty well known that the limit for transferring bitcoins was actually broken in Mt Gox. It stopped you from moving more than that in one withdrawal, but you could immediately ask for more and get another $1000 USD worth, over and over. I decided against this, since it was exploiting a bug, and I definitely didn&#39;t want to do anything suspicious looking or improper.   The thought also occurred to me that there were only about 100 bitcoins worth of buy orders back on the market in the minutes immediately following all of this. I could place a reasonably sized sell order for $0.001, crash the market again, and withdraw probably all of the bitcoins, since they&#39;d be valued at $0.001 each and would fit under the $1000 USD limit. I also decided against this, when I realized that whoever placed the gigantic sell order was probably doing so for the exact same reasons and I knew how that would make me look.  I then sent an private message on IRC to MagicalTux (Mark Karpeles, the founder of Mt Gox) to explain that I was the one who won the giant buy order, and that I wasn&#39;t the same person as whoever placed the huge sell order. We&#39;d talked previously, including a private talk a couple of days ago about Mt Gox&#39;s &#34;change my password&#34; system not working. He didn&#39;t respond to me at all, but I figured he was busy. A few minutes later he was saying in public that he&#39;d decided to reverse all the recent trades, effectively undoing the final 3602 trades that were executed before he shut the site down.  We talked a bit, and I started to become increasingly concerned with what Mt Gox was saying in public which was totally contradicting what I knew to have happened. The Mt Gox status page said:    &#34;One account with a lot of coins was compromised and whoever stole it (using a HK based IP to login) first sold all the coins in there, to buy those again just after, and then tried to withdraw the coins. The $1000/day withdraw limit was active for this account and the hacker could only get out with $1000 worth of coins.&#34;\n There are three very misleading elements in that line alone.  First, this makes it sound like the &#34;hacker&#34; is the one who was buying back all the bitcoins at a penny. We all were watching the trades execute in real time, there was only one buy order of anywhere near the size of the huge sell order that went through, and I was the buyer not the hacker. Other people in IRC were saying which other buy orders they were able to get. The hacker couldn&#39;t have been able to buy back even 10% of the bitcoins that were sold during the sell-off. Did this mean Mark thought *I* was the hacker? I have repeatedly asked him this question, which he&#39;s managed to ignore each time.  Recently I&#39;ve been getting into the bitcoin trading market. Over the last couple of weeks, I was hitting the $1000 USD Dwolla cash withdrawal limit from Mt Gox, so I requested that it be increased. I sent Mt Gox a copy of my driver&#39;s license and two utility bills in my name/address to prove my identity, which Mark accepted and increased my limit. Could that have been faked? Sure. But, if I was the hacker I was going about this whole thing stupidly. I had several ways I could have drained the Mt Gox account, and deliberately didn&#39;t. I immediately contacted Mark to identify myself as the buyer and offer assistance. If I were up to something shady, I was doing a really bad job at it.  The second thing wrong with Mt Gox&#39;s statement is that it makes it sound like only the hacker managed to withdraw any money, and even then only $1000 worth. I alone withdrew 643 bitcoins (worth more than $10,000 USD easily). The withdrawal limit feature was so broken, it was hard to imagine the hacker didn&#39;t know how to exploit it.  On top of how misleading I felt they were being about what I knew occurred, I felt it was far worse that they were using this argument for why they wanted to undo the trades. From reading their public statements, they&#39;re making it sound like they&#39;re reverting the trades because they want to prevent a hacker from profiting from it. This is simply not true, the vast majority, if not all of the buy orders that picked up coins at a low price were regular users like myself. Any profit this hacker was going to make, he&#39;s already done so. The majority of the buy orders that got executed were standing orders from legit users that had been in the system for quite some time, and those are the orders he&#39;s threatening to revert.  And this is where I, like others here, have a problem. Of course I am greatly biased here, but look at what&#39;s going on:   1)  Rolling back/Breaking trades is something Mt Gox said they wouldn&#39;t do.  Many exchanges will break trades if something truly unusual happened, but there&#39;s a policy listed in advance so everyone knows how, when and why it will kick in. Mt Gox never claimed they felt they had the authority to undo trades, in fact the Mt Gox website states:    &#34;You are trading with other users of Mt Gox. Mt Gox does not act as a counter party to any trades.&#34;\n Claiming that Mt Gox isn&#39;t a &#34;counter party&#34; to trades has a specific legal meaning. Typically market participants, stock brokers and other associated people are &#34;counter parties&#34; or &#34;central counter parties&#34; to trades, taking on the burden of insuring trades were executed properly. Put simply, Mt Gox was saying in legal terms they were only acting as a match maker between buyers and sellers, not involving themselves in any issues that may come up from the trades themselves.  If they&#39;re claiming they have no responsibility for what occurs, that means they don&#39;t get to flex any control over it. You&#39;re either merely introducing buyers and sellers to each other and have no liability or power over what happens after that point, or you are a central counter party to the trade and do get to make those decisions. Mt Gox is trying to have it both ways, after telling us that they didn&#39;t want the responsibility. No rollback policy was ever published or even discussed anywhere I could find.    2)  Mt Gox had been repeatedly warned about password security issues recently, and continued to reassure us everything was safe.  An exchange cannot be allowed to reassure customers of their security and fail to accept responsibility when it is proven to be insecure. As customers of Mt Gox, we cannot have the same visibility into their systems that they do and must rely on their word that the exchange is trustworthy. If exchanges are allowed to repeatedly tell us we can rely on their trading platform, fail at securing it, then be given a blank check to remove funds from anyone they desire to make themselves whole again, no exchange has any incentive to secure themselves.   3)  The precedent they&#39;re setting here cannot be maintained.  Exactly what happened here may never be fully known, but according to Mt Gox an unauthorized user accessed someone&#39;s account and placed a sell order. Passwords get guessed/leaked all the time, and any exchange that attempts to undo that in every case will undoubtably fail.   If I&#39;m careless with my password and someone places orders on my behalf in my account without my permission, will Mt Gox revert an hour&#39;s worth of trading to fix it? What if I only had 2 bitcoins? Or 20? or 200? There is no way rolling back trades to handle a compromised password in any way that will scale to the size of bitcoin&#39;s current economy. Unless Mt Gox is wiling to explicitly say they&#39;ll give this same treatment to any user who has their account compromised, it&#39;s blatantly unfair to everyone else.   This also opens the door to allowing anyone to request equal treatment if they made some trades they later regret. Log in through a proxy to make it seem like someone from a distant country was using your account, make your trades, then later scream about how your account was compromised and you want a do-over.   4)  The whole situation seems fishy once you know everything thats been made public.  Mt Gox&#39;s story is requiring extreme leaps of faith to believe. They have insisted that only one account was accessed. This means they expect us to believe:  \u00a0* A Mt Gox user had more than 500,000 bitcoins stored in their Mt Gox account (more than $8 million by Sunday&#39;s prices). \u00a0* This user chose a password that was able to be guessed by a password cracker from the encrypted hash of their pass. (This means their password was likely quite simple) \u00a0* This user managed to amass this many bitcoins without being involved in the community enough to hear everyone screaming about the password file being leaked to the world. \u00a0* Mark claimed to me that police reports were filed in less than an hour after Mt Gox&#39;s trading was halted. \u00a0* The decision to roll back trades was announced within minutes of them investigating. \u00a0* Mt Gox&#39;s public statements have been, at best, misleading.  All of this is so implausible that I can&#39;t help but believe we are not being told the whole story. I am  not implying that I believe Mt Gox is acting dishonorably, but that if they don&#39;t respond to this sort of thing, people will start jumping to worse conclusions.  If I had $8 million worth of easily convertible currency, there is absolutely no way I would store it on a public website like Mt Gox, no matter how secure I believed it was. If I had to store that much there, even temporarily, I would use a password so long it would make War and Peace look like a Twitter message.   Is the account owner a friend or investor in Mt Gox?\u00a0 The account owner managed to get decisions made and a police report filed faster than I was able to get a response out of Mark. If there is some kind of connection between the account owner at Mt Gox, this needs to be fully disclosed and explained before any actions are taken, or any trust in what Mt Gox does is going to be shattered.  I am not actually accusing Mt Gox of scamming us or anything, but asking their users to accept over 500,000 BTC in orders to be reversed due to a story that has some serious holes in it, greatly benefits an anonymous account holder, and has some elements that are provably false is simply unacceptable.   5)  Claims that they want to revert to protect the market are false.  Again, unless there are major pieces of the story missing, the hacker has already gotten away with whatever they were going to. Secure the compromised account with a better password and that matter is closed.  Mt Gox&#39;s website was severely affected by the large sell order, very very few new sell orders made it into the system. A few people did get some panic sells in during the freefall, but they were tiny in comparison to the volume of the big sell that started the mess.  The majority of the &#34;buy&#34; orders that got executed were long standing buy orders that were already in the system. Those people, before any crash started, told the system of their intent to buy at specific prices, and those agreements were honored. At worst, buyers got exactly what they already agreed to purchase, at best got a good deal.  The market made a 70% recovery within minutes, and was continuing to trend upwards before Mt Gox halted trading and shut their web server down.  The only parties that need to be involved in this are Mt Gox and the original account owner to determine if any unauthorized trades were actually made from their account, and how Mt Gox is going to make it up to them.   6)  Mt Gox has several options before them, and are choosing to screw over the community to protect their profit.  I&#39;ve seen people throwing around three options:  Option 1: Rollback all trades.  + The guy who chose to store $8m in bitcoins on a public website gets the majority of his money back + Mt Gox is out very little ? Sellers who placed a panic sell during the freefall get a free undo. - This sets a precedent that trades can be reversed, which increases risk and will likely result in some players want to wait for their trades to &#34;clear&#34; before taking further action making us no better than using PayPal. - This gives strong incentive for traders to immediately withdraw funds after a trade, which will greatly reduce liquidity. - Buyers who had both new and long time orders that were executed are getting them revoked by a policy that didn&#39;t exist yesterday. - Had I not decided to &#34;do the right thing&#34; and leave the funds in Mt Gox, this wouldn&#39;t even be an option.  Option 2: Mt Gox tells the account owner &#34;tough luck&#34; and does nothing.  + Everyone else who placed orders will be unaffected - The account owner that got hacked is facing massive losses from something that may have not been completely their fault. - This gives strong incentive for traders to immediately withdraw funds after a trade, which will greatly reduce liquidity. - Mt Gox ends up earning their trading fees off someone&#39;s loss that they were likely partially or fully responsible for.  Option 3: Mt Gox takes responsibility, and reimburses the original account owner&#39;s account to the best of their ability.  + The exchange is forced to deal with the consequences of their negligent lapse in security + Faith in the trading market would be largely restored if not increased + Buyers who placed orders that were executed get what they paid for + Mt Gox has clearly made several times more revenue (through trading fees) than this incident would cost them to completely absorb. + If this became an expected feature of an exchange, only exchanges that actually protected our accounts would survive. + Mt Gox is the only party that can go after the auditor that they are claiming was responsible for this incident - It is uncertain if Mt Gox actually has that much liquid reserve to do this fully.  I am publicly asking Mt Gox to explain why they are unwilling to go for Option 3. They&#39;re choosing the option that costs them the least, protecting this mystery user at the expense of the entire bitcoin community. Their decision will result it everyone refusing to keep balances in the exchange for fear that profitable trades will be lost at the whim of the exchange owner. You&#39;ve heard my story, if you make a sudden windfall trade that nets you a good profit, how long are you going to let Mt Gox hold onto it, out of fear they&#39;re going to claim it was invalid? If everyone is doing this, where is the money going to come from to make trades?   I realize a lot of this is going to fall on deaf ears who think Im only doing this for my own profit. Id believe this no matter what, but I probably wouldnt be fighting so passionately if I didnt have some stake in it.  I made a bunch of attempts to try to come up with some kind of mutually agreed on plan with the Mt Gox people, only to get stalled (they won&#39;t even talk to me until I sent them notarized copies of my photo ID on a Sunday?). I&#39;d like to end as much uncertainty as I can, so this is my side. We all have opportunities to totally disrupt the market. I could threaten legal action which would cause an even bigger run on their reserves. Mt Gox could close their doors and take everyone&#39;s cash. I could have drained the money from Mt Gox but didn&#39;t.

Of the 139 million Americans who have become fully vaccinated since December, a mere 3,459 (0.000024 per cent)  have suffered a serious COVID-19 infection in spite of vaccination.\n    The couple were leaving a state of 10 million people that was now counting  record-low case rates of only 300 infections per day. Comprehensive infection data from Israel, meanwhile, has shown that people like the Floridas are now  94 per cent less likely to transmit the virus to others. And on top of everything, they both showed up at the border with negative COVID-19 test results.\n    The Government of Canada did not care. The couple was forced into mandatory 14-day home quarantine and supervised by \u201c10 or 20\u201d phone calls per day from quarantine officers \u2014 as well as regular in-person visits.\n  It seems like you would want to deploy those resources better than just sort of being a pest\n  \u201cIt seems like you would want to deploy those resources better than just sort of being a pest,\u201d Florida told the National Post.\n  Florida is but one of thousands of people now caught in a latticework of Canadian COVID-19 restrictions that have ceased to have any relationship to reality. As COVID-19 goes into full retreat across the country, Canadian governments are stubbornly adhering to restrictions that are not only pointless, but incur a daily tithe of debt, closed businesses and lockdown-related fatalities. At a time when Canada should be casting off the shackles of one of its most damaging single events,\u00a0 entrenched interests seem bent on seeing it continue.\n  . @ranaflorida &amp; I just got a visit from Canadian public health authorities checking on our quarantine. We are now being observed doing our Day 8 online Covid test. We are both fully vaccinated. Is it crazy to think such precious public health resources could be put to better use\n\u2014 Richard Florida (@Richard_Florida)  June 16, 2021\n    On Thursday,  only 12 people in Canada died from COVID-19. For context, in a typical year 19 Canadians  can be expected to die every day from flu or pneumonia. In that same average day, 17 will die of Alzheimers, 38 will be killed in accidents and 11 will die by suicide.\n    In much of the country, the risks from COVID-19 have now been definitively outstripped by Canada\u2019s other public health emergency: the opioid crisis. Two Albertans died of COVID-19 on Thursday. By contrast, in just the first two months of 2021 Alberta saw an  average of four fatal overdoses per day.\n    Canada now has one of the lowest rates of per-capita COVID-19 fatalities in the entire G20. At the end of this week, the average citizen of the European Union is now  61 per cent more likely to die of COVID-19 than the average Canadian, even though the case rates in both places are  roughly the same. And while the rise of the Delta variant has spurred worry, it is proving to be just as resilient to vaccination as any other strain of COVID-19.\n  COVID-free for the first time since March 26, 2020! \ud83c\udf89 This is the first time the MSICU at Toronto General does not have any COVID patients. We are very grateful for the extraordinary MSICU team!  #ThankYou  pic.twitter.com/LGmNsF8snY\n\u2014 University Health Network (@UHN)  June 16, 2021\n    On every front, Canada\u2019s pandemic is speeding towards its end: A fast-tracked and innovative national  vaccine strategy has bought Canadians deliverance from COVID-19 faster than almost anyone thought possible.\n  The country now has the world\u2019s second-highest rate of first-dose vaccine coverage, and 4.8 million people are now fully vaccinated \u2014  including half of all Canadians over the age of 80.\n  The country\u2019s reward for this epidemiological miracle? A continued lockdown on commerce and civic life that, in many ways, is indistinguishable from the summer of 2020, when a vaccine still seemed a distant pipe dream and more than two thirds of the country\u2019s 26,000 COVID fatalities had yet to die.\n    For more than a year, schools have been identified around the world as negligible vectors for COVID-19 transmission, in large part because the virus  has such a hard time sticking to children. Regardless, Ontario schools have remained under indefinite closure since April, despite  even a May 29 statement from Ontario\u2019s own COVID-19 Science Advisory Table saying that the province \u201ccan re-open schools safely.\u201d\n    The Government of Ontario had promised that as soon as 70 per cent of adults reached first-dose vaccination, the province would legalize hair salons, outdoor amusements and tables of up to six people at outdoor restaurants \u2014 all of which have been allowed for months in many other regions of North America. Even with Ontario now at 75 per cent vaccination coverage, a government-mandated interval of three weeks means that hair salons will continue to remain shuttered until July.\n  \u201cEvery single \u2026 hour lockdowns continue, more small business owners make the decision to close their doors forever,\u201d Dan Kelly, CEO of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, wrote in a Thursday Tweet.\n  Every single day, hour lockdowns continue, more small business owners make the decision to close their doors forever. Yes, there is light at the end of the tunnel, but the capacity for small firms to hang on is extremely limited.\n\u2014 Dan Kelly (@CFIB)  June 17, 2021\n    But the most overzealous COVID strictures can be found at the Canadian border. The federal government  has put in plans to lift its mandatory quarantine for fully vaccinated travellers \u2014 but not until July. And even then, incoming travellers must continue to provide two negative COVID-19 tests regardless of vaccination status \u2014 a requirement well beyond the pale of almost any other Western nation.\n  As a renowned urban theorist, Florida can usually be heard talking up his adoptive Toronto home as a haven for what he calls the \u201ccreative class\u201d \u2014 the scientists, engineers, tech investors and others who help invigorate urban economies.\n  Now, as Florida\u2019s usual world of conferences, summits and book tours start up again, he  faces fines and even jail time if he so much as steps outside for a walk before his quarantine ends on Tuesday. He suspects he\u2019s not the only one thinking hard about whether it\u2019s still possible for him to do his job from Canadian soil.\n  Yup same story, we are on day 13 of quarantine and tomorrow is our last day.  An official actually showed up on day 7. He agreed with us that it is pointless we are quarantining despite being fully vaccinated (and 2 negative tests), but he is just doing his job \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\u2014 Avinash Collis (@avi_collis)  June 15, 2021\n    \u201cThis is literally like hanging out a sign and saying \u2018global talent, we\u2019re kind of on the fence about you,\u2019\u201d he told the National Post.\n  Canada\u2019s hesitance on reopening also risks leaving whole sectors of the economy out of the global rebound, including the country\u2019s  $100 billion-per-year tourism industry. As early as February, Poland lifted its quarantine requirements for fully vaccinated tourists. France opened its borders to vaccinated visitors earlier this month. As of this writing,  more than 30 countries are jumpstarting their tourism industries with special provisions for vaccinated travellers \u2014 particularly those from the heavily vaccinated U.S.\n  Canada, by contrast, just extended its non-essential travel ban with the U.S.  until at least July 21, ostensibly to keep \u201cCanadians safe,\u201d according to a statement by Minister of Public Safety Bill Blair. The borders similarly remain closed to everyone else looking to take a Canadian vacation, regardless of their vaccination status. \u201cYou can\u2019t enter Canada for discretionary travel,\u201d reads a blunt declaration on the Government of Canada\u2019s  official information page for foreign visitors.\n  Our number one priority as we fight  #COVID19 is keeping Canadians safe. In coordination with the U.S., we are extending restrictions on non-essential international travel and with the United States until July 21st, 2021.\n\u2014 Bill Blair (@BillBlair)  June 18, 2021\n    Not only is this shutting out yet another summer for Canada\u2019s bankruptcy-plagued tourism sector, but it risks permanently altering long-established travel patterns. Canada\u2019s refusal to reopen its ports to even fully vaccinated cruise vessels, for instance, has spurred a legislative push in the U.S. to encourage cruise operators to  bypass Canadian ports permanently.\n  \u201cCanada\u00a0cannot afford to be left behind as other countries around the world begin to reopen,\u201d Susie Grynol, president of the Hotel Association of\u00a0Canada,  said in a statement this week.\n  But while overzealous Canadian lockdowns may be progressively losing touch with scientific evidence, it would be wrong to say that they\u2019re necessarily against public opinion.\n    A  June 9 poll by Maru Public Opinion found that 69 per cent of Ontarians approved of school closures. And despite living within North America\u2019s most locked-down jurisdiction, half approved of the performance of Premier Doug Ford. An Angus Reid Institute poll released the same day wasn\u2019t nearly as warm towards Ford, but it nevertheless found that Ontarians  approved of his performance on COVID more than any other single file, including the economy, healthcare and education.\n  As the U.S. crawls out of its pandemic, American communities have reached out to Canadians with a wave of good neighbourliness. Communities in Alaska, Montana and Washington State have even offered extra vaccine doses to Canadian towns across the border to speed up reopening.\n  The Blackfeet Nation in Montana gifted their surplus COVID-19 vaccines (750 doses) to nearby residents in Alberta, Canada.

The dish &#34;overheated&#34; and &#34;Starlink will reconnect after cooling down,&#34; the error message said:\n  The user, named Martin, posted a screenshot of the  error message on Reddit. He contacted Starlink support, which told him, &#34;Dishy will go into thermal shutdown at 122F and will restart when it reaches 104F.&#34;\u00a0Martin decided to give the dish a little water so it could cool down. He pointed a sprinkler at Dishy, and once it cooled enough to turn back on, &#34;I immediately heard YouTube resume playback,&#34; he wrote yesterday.\n  &#34;The fix was temporary,&#34; he told us. &#34;When I stopped the sprinkler, [the dish] heated back up and would cycle back on for a few minutes and go back down for thermal shutdown. The overheating started that day about 11:30am and came back for good about 7pm... I&#39;m currently headed to a hardware store to get materials to build a solar shade/sail around the dish to see if it doesn&#39;t impact connection and speed.&#34;\n Martin uses the ground behind his house to set up his dish because it is the only spot with no obstructions. But there&#39;s &#34;no shade to speak of,&#34; he wrote in the Reddit comment thread.\n  Officially,  SpaceX has said that &#34;Dishy McFlatface&#34; is\u00a0certified to operate from 22\u00b0 below zero up to 104\u00b0 Fahrenheit. Temperatures reached about 120\u00b0 yesterday in Martin&#39;s town of Topock, near Arizona&#39;s border with California, he said. Though Dishy doesn&#39;t go into thermal shutdown until it hits 122\u00b0, the dish can obviously get hotter than the air temperature.\n &#34;I&#39;m thinking the radiating heat from the ground is effectively cooking the bottom of the dish, [while] the top of the dish is cooked by the sun,&#34; Martin told Ars. In addition to the shade he&#39;s building, Martin said he is &#34;waiting for permitting for a HAM radio tower&#34; that would lift the dish off the ground to help keep it cool enough to operate.\n Martin said he also had very short outages on several days since last week, but service came back before he had time to confirm whether they were caused by heat. SpaceX told users to expect periodic outages during beta, so Martin&#39;s previous outages could have been due either to heat or satellite availability.\n  Another user in Virginia experienced a half-hour outage due to overheating on a day with temperatures in the low 80s, according to a  Reddit post two months ago.\n Martin&#39;s post spurred a response from a beta user who also reported thermal shutdowns. &#34;You&#39;re not the only one. My Starlink is located 50 miles south of Grand Canyon in remote area,&#34; one person wrote yesterday. &#34;It&#39;s been off and on also. It stopped today one hour after cool down period but quit again as [of] ~12:30. Last reported temp at my weather station was 103 degrees.&#34;\n The 122\u00b0 F shutdown temperature was mentioned three weeks ago in a\u00a0 Reddit post by a user who had also been given the figure by Starlink support. &#34;&#39;That&#39;s it??&#39; was my thought. On a 90 degree day, the rooftop of my house can be around 125 degrees,&#34; that user wrote.\n &#34;Are you sure that wasn\u2019t Celsius?&#34; another asked. (122\u00b0 C converts to 251.6\u00b0 F.)\n Like Martin, other Starlink users may have to find creative ways to keep their dishes cool as the summer months arrive.\n  As we  wrote in December, a teardown of Dishy McFlatface showed some of its heat-management components, including a metal shield that&#39;s peppered with blue dots made of thermally conductive material that conducts heat away from the PCB and into the shield.\n Ken Keiter, the engineer who performed the teardown, was interviewed by Vice&#39;s Motherboard section for a  story about the Arizona resident today:\n Keiter told Motherboard that while reasonable consideration was given to heat dissipation in Dishy&#39;s design, he could see the potential for problems.\n &#34;The phased array assembly comprises a PCBA (printed circuit board assembly) adhered to an aluminum backplate which serves several purposes\u2014acting as RF shielding, providing structural rigidity and, most relevantly, acting as a radiative thermal mass (heat sink) for the components on the PCBA,&#34; Keiter said.\n Heat is funneled from the circuit board to the aluminum backplate using a foam-like thermal interface material (TIM). The backplate itself resides in a weather-sealed cavity containing a small amount of air. As this backplate heats up, the air surrounding it also heats, transferring thermal energy via the plastic enclosure to the outside environment, Keiter said.\n &#34;Here&#39;s the problem: at some point, the combined thermal energy being absorbed by Dishy&#39;s face and being dumped by the components into the backplate, the air surrounding it, and the enclosure exceeds the amount that is being dissipated to the outside environment,&#34; he noted.\n Keiter said that software changes could &#34;make the system more thermally efficient&#34; but that it&#39;s possible SpaceX will need to make &#34;a significant hardware revision for the commercial launch.&#34; He called it &#34;a really tricky engineering problem with some insanely tight constraints.&#34;\n   The Starlink public beta  began in October 2020, and there&#39;s still no word on when exactly it will hit commercial availability. But the service could happen within months as SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has  said that Starlink will be available to &#34;most of Earth&#34; by the end of 2021 and the whole planet by next year. Still, SpaceX expects to have a limited number of slots in each geographic region because of capacity constraints.\n SpaceX is seeking Federal Communications Commission permission to deploy up to 5 million user terminals in the US. Over 500,000 people have ordered Starlink, and  Musk has said he expects all of those users to get service. But he also said that SpaceX will face &#34;more of a challenge when we get into the several million user range.&#34; The biggest limitation would be in densely populated urban areas; rural users would have better odds of getting service.\n As noted earlier, Starlink warns beta users to expect &#34;brief periods of no connectivity at all&#34;\u2014even if they don&#39;t run into thermal shutdowns.\u00a0&#34;We still have a lot of work to do to make the network reliable,&#34; SpaceX president and COO Gwynne Shotwell  said in April. &#34;We still have drops, not necessarily just because of where the satellites are in the sky.&#34; SpaceX will keep the service in beta &#34;until the network is reliable and great and something we&#39;d be proud of,&#34; Shotwell said.\n The Verge  reviewed Starlink last month and found frustrating reliability problems. &#34;Like the similarly over-hyped mmWave 5G, Starlink is remarkably delicate. Even a  single tree blocking the dish&#39;s line of sight to the horizon will degrade and interrupt your Starlink signal,&#34; The Verge wrote.\n  The service will surely become more stable by the time SpaceX moves it from beta to general availability, as Shotwell promised. Even in beta, Starlink is providing much-needed connectivity to people with no other options. If SpaceX brings reliable broadband to a few million users, that would be a success, but there may be  tens of millions of Americans without access to high-speed broadband.  Tens of millions of others have to pay whatever the cable company demands because there&#39;s no competition where they live.\n Widespread fiber-to-the-home deployment would make a bigger difference for more Internet users than Starlink. President Joe Biden pledged to lower prices and deploy &#34;future-proof&#34; broadband to all Americans, but he&#39;s already  scaled back his plan in the face of opposition from Republicans and incumbent ISPs. AT&amp;T has been  lobbying against nationwide fiber and funding for municipal networks, and AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey  expressed confidence last week that Congress will steer legislation in the direction that AT&amp;T favors.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 23:58:04", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "starlink,dishes", "title": "\u4e00\u65e6\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fbe\u5230122\u00b0\u534e\u6c0f\u5ea6\uff0cStarlink Dishes\u5c31\u4f1a\u8fdb\u5165\u201c\u70ed\u5173\u65ad\u201d ", "title_en": "Starlink dishes go into \u201cthermal shutdown\u201d once they hit 122\u00b0 Fahrenheit", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/06/starlink-dish-overheats-in-arizona-sun-knocking-user-offline-for-7-hours/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["starlink", "dishes"]}]
