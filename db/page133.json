", "note_en": "Note: I\u2019m writing this as a former employee (as of June 2021) of Autodesk. My views are entirely my own, based on my recollections and personal experiences during my time with the company.\n I\u2019ve been working with the  Shotgun team in various capacities for t  he past 7 years, shortly after it was acquired by  Autodesk. The first few months I worked with the team, people would ask me what it was like, and I\u2019d always answer \u201cabsolutely everyone is super-smart, it\u2019s really weird\u201d. Practically everyone who was there back then has now moved onto other things outside of Autodesk, but I stay in touch with many of them and miss working with them all greatly.\n Today I read  this post (warning: the language used in the post is quite strong). It\u2019s the kind of thing no Product Manager wants to read, as it signifies us having failed our users. It made me reflect on how things have changed both in the company and how those changes have manifested in the formerly beloved product itself over the past few years.\n When I started, the feeling within the Shotgun team was one of a startup embedded within a larger corporation. We had a great deal of autonomy, and I spent the first few months blissfully unaware of what most of the rest of Autodesk was doing. We were focused on one thing, and that singular purpose, combined with the fact that most of the team (myself included) had been plucked out of the industry we were now serving, meant that all of us cared deeply about the work we were doing. Customer pain wasn\u2019t a cliche, it was our pain too. I spent months embedded with people trying to use Shotgun to get their film and episodic shows produced, I was there when things went wrong for them and they lost time or got frustrated. Our company mission was to \u201cget people home in time for dinner\u201d and we all knew how important that was. We had seen people work long hours, sacrificing everything for the sake of a single shot in a piece of media (or had been one of those people). We desperately wanted to succeed.\n  Even when I joined seven years ago, much of the technology used in the web-based product was dated, and many of the design patterns and user interactions were archaic or undercooked in a rush to get them out the door. From a certain perspective, this was a good thing\u2013 the product had product-market fit, and arguably a big part of the reason for that was that its development process was optimised for being responsive to the multitude of varying needs of its customers, not in spending time and energy in polishing features that were good enough. One thing I learned about building B2B software, is that every customer needs different things. So if you have customer A who needs something, then you go and build it as quickly as possible, when customer B comes along with a different problem, you are incentivised in the short term to now go and build the thing customer B needs, rather than iterating on the feature you just made for the benefit of some imaginary future customer. Everyone wants to build software that delights, but doing so often means not doing something else, and when you are trying to make people \u201chappy\u201d and \u201cwilling to pay\u201d, as opposed to \u201cdelighted\u201d, something has to give.\n Years of this mindset had created a product that was feature-rich, had incredible retention, even winning an Academy Award, but was falling apart at the seams from product debt. We had reached a point with the product where whenever we tried to build anything new or otherwise update certain aspects of the software, dozens of unrelated things would break. There was limited test coverage across all the code, and conversely a lot of different ways for users to configure their particular experience. It wasn\u2019t that every instance of Shotgun was unique, but it wasn\u2019t far off.\n It was a problem that always seemed incomprehensible to new leadership. Someone would join the team with the ambition to make us go faster, assuming it was down to lack of motivation or willingness to make changes. I referred to  this excellent article often when I was thinking about this situation, and this graph in particular:\n  We were constantly in the red area of the graph. We had tons of data on what we needed to do with the product, debated furiously about what was the most important of all the things to commit our scarce resources to, because doing anything at all would be extremely challenging and costly; and then failed to execute effectively. That though, was not down to any technical hurdles. It was down to an existential issue.\n  Autodesk is a big corporation, albeit one with less than 10,000 employees globally. It\u2019s best known for AutoCAD, though the overall product portfolio probably numbers in the hundreds. Most of what Autodesk does is serve the architectural, construction and manufacturing industries. A tiny portion of its revenue though, comes from media &amp; entertainment, predominantly high-end 3D content creation and rendering (with Shotgun as the product that focuses on the business functions of those processes). No one seems to know, or at least be able to articulate why it maintains its deathgrip (over time it has acquired many of the dominant products in the space) over a vertical that doesn\u2019t materially factor into the company\u2019s bottom line. We would speculate that there\u2019s the sex appeal (such as it is) of big splashy visual effects showreels in stark contrast to photos of people with hardhats and the umpteenth render of a building exterior in corporate marketing materials. Whatever the reason, we constantly felt that the corporate overlords would at some point decide to cut their losses and drop the entire division. That never happened though. Instead we had a string of reorgs and their corresponding shifts in focus.\n Around three years ago our product group was selected to pilot a new \u201cincubation\u201d process within Autodesk. On paper it was a superb idea- you allow a group to effectively function with the same level of autonomy\u2013 and accountability\u2013 as a startup would. Our goals became growth-based, we had targets and if those targets were successfully met then our \u201cfunding\u201d would increase accordingly.\n The problem though, was that no-one on the team actually cared about growth. \u201cGet people home in time for dinner\u201d had to become something more like \u201cget even more people home at some time\u201d. Our growth targets then just became a means to an end: get more users and then we get permission to do the stuff that we actually felt excited by.\n With all of this came a sense of (in retrospect) unjustified optimism. The team was restructured, some development teams were dropped and more senior managers were hired in their place. The idea was to get them in place for when our team would be able to grow. The only thing we needed to figure out was where to find the growth opportunity.\n The high-end visual effects industry that we dominated is notoriously slow to adapt to change, and operates for the most part on razor-thin margins. There were billions flowing into film and episodic production every year, but there wasn\u2019t (and likely still isn\u2019t) an obvious opportunity to further monetise our existing customers. But there were two bets that might make a difference. First, Shotgun was too hard to get up and running for anyone unfamiliar with it (due to us never having paid back the aforementioned product debt). Fixing this might lead to greater adoption. Second, although Shotgun popular with Producers and Coordinators, Artists didn\u2019t get on well with it. It was estimated that in a given company there were many more artists not using Shotgun than there were people already using it and that winning them over would lead to significant growth.\n We organised around going after those two potential opportunities and then almost immediately ran into trouble. I (along with a couple of other product managers) was involved with solving the ease of use problem. What was easy was identifying the roadblocks and them prioritising their importance. Where we came unstuck was in actually trying to implement viable solutions to those problems. Any single problem we tried to address was going to be a multi-month effort with the team we had and the technical challenges we would have to overcome (and again, in retrospect even those estimates seem woefully optimistic). There was also the problem which no-one really wanted to admit, which was we didn\u2019t have experience of building things that were easy to use (fortunately, for me at least, many of the people we hired over the past couple of years  did have that experience, and I learned a lot from them).\n But we tried, thinking we could tackle smaller line items in shorter time spans and build up a sort of momentum. We budgeted work by the quarter, but the first quarter worth of work stretched out to two quarters, then required further work in addressing regressions, then more regressions. My choice each time was between abandoning the work half-finished and try something else, or else seeing things through to completion. I chose the latter option, because we had a long history of leaving things half-finished, and everyone on the team, and our customers, was pretty tired of it. I still don\u2019t know if it was the right one, but it definitely wasn\u2019t the wrong one.\n Meanwhile, the artist opportunity was pursued by building out a new product from the ground up, using a much more modern technology stack than we were used to. It represented the future, but it also meant that many developers who were experienced with Ruby or C++ had to reskill in a very short space of time. It was hard. The product, Shotgun Create, ultimately launched as a vastly superior (in terms of user experience) alternative to Shotgun\u2019s capabilities for reviewing and approving work. But it was hard to get people to actually use it. For a couple of months or so, everyone across the organisation stopped what they were doing to help out on the adoption push. It was a stressful time for many, and when it was over, had left a deep scar on the team.\n Two opposing schools of thought were forming. In one camp, the only way forward was to completely redesign and rebuild Shotgun from scratch, using modern engineering and design. In the other, we had to make incremental changes, minimizing disruption to users above all else. Both approaches had their pros and cons, but the team couldn\u2019t be aligned to one or the other. From leadership down, we oscillated back and forth between each. During this stormy time, the strategy to improve adoption through changes in the product was jettisoned in favour of a focus on Go To Market, and a number of key people departed the company, either through frustration or having been terminated.\n The result of this was that for the first time the majority of employees on the Shotgun team were not native to the media and entertainment industry. Many of them were willing to learn, and had a strong sense of empathy, but it would take time to build the domain knowledge up. Priorities shifted once more, this time to focus on integrating with the Autodesk corporate machinery. It was a sensible approach, as it would remove things that were bespoke to Shotgun without providing any real benefit, such as billing and sales channels, but it carried a massive opportunity cost, with leadership making it the top priority for us, and requiring a lot of work over a number of months for the team without having anything users would actually care about to show for it. More reorgs happened, as if to drive this point home. The \u201cStreet Team\u201d, a support team comprised of extremely smart and knowledgeable former Shotgun experts and workflow specialists, was dissolved, with the general Autodesk support team attempting to fill in. From the perspective of the product team, we pretty much stopped hearing from customers altogether (aside from those we were speaking to directly).\n The incubation process ended, or perhaps fizzled out. Many customers were complaining that their needs were not being met, but there wasn\u2019t capacity to do anything about it (others had since given up complaining, which was in many ways worse). What we were trying to focus our energies on at that point was creating the infrastructure to create new experiences in a piecemeal way that would be decoupled from the problematic technology stack. Our bet was that being able to build in a new environment would allow for experimentation and iteration at a speed expected of a modern software company. It represented our attempt to finally break free of the technical debt that had plagued us for years. It was exciting.\n  I can\u2019t say (both for legal reasons, and because I don\u2019t know) where things are headed for Shotgun going forwards. It has recently been renamed to \u201cShotGrid\u201d in an effort to make it less problematic, as part of the integration work (and needless to say, requiring a lot of work in its own right). I can count the number of people still working on the ShotGrid team who have industry experience on one hand (and the former willingness to learn and empathise seems to have dissipated), a far cry from how it was when I joined. Perhaps that doesn\u2019t matter. Perhaps the remaining ShotGrid team will be able to address the product debt issues and modernise or otherwise improve it for the userbase in a way we were unable to do. More than anything, I hope to read a post from a customer at some point in the future, telling a story about how the product helped them get home in time for dinner.", "posttime": "2021-06-21

", "note_en": "I&#39;m switching to Julia after running this comparison of Julia vs Numpy and Fortran, for performance and code simplicity.\n      Julia is a pretty new language, which, among other things, aims tosolve the so-called  \u201ctwo-language problem\u201d in scientific computing.\n That is, we usually test ideas in a  rapid-prototyping languagelike Matlab or Python, but when the testing is done, and its timeto do some serious computation, we need to rely on a different (compiled)programming language.\n Many tools exist to ease the transition, and  wrapping Fortran librariesinto Python has been my preference so far. For example, wrapping up some Fortran with F2PY seems like a very convenient wayto use (and distribute) efficient Fortran code that anybody can run.I also keep track of various ways of using Fortran in Python in  this post.\n Now,  Julia aims to solve this issue in a radical way. The idea is to usea single programming language, which has both an interactive mode, suitablefor rapid prototyping, but that can also be compiled and executed at C/Fortranperformance.\n     Numpy is restricted to single-threading in many cases, is hard to code and read, and can be much slower than the two alternatives.\n Fortran offers great performance with pretty simple code, but some wrapping is required to call Fortran from high-level languages like Python.\n Julia is faster and easier to write than Numpy and is even able to beat gfortran\u2019s performance.\n Honestly, I was shocked by what I found in my performance comparison.Julia is amazing.  I didn\u2019t expect Julia would beat gfortran with compiler optimizations in my test.And it currently does so  by a lofty margin.\n  Opinions on code readability are, of course, subjective, but I want to explainwhy I think  Numpy offers the worst quality experience.\n So far, interpreted languages have required manual re-writing of loops as vector operations.With some practice, this becomes and easy task, but after having done so extensively for many years (first in Matlab, then in Python),I came to the conclusion that  I hate to manually vectorize code. I prefer to write for loops and have the compiler vectorize them for me!\n   Can you tell what it does, at first sight? Can you reason about the code\u2019s performance?Can you even guess the dimension of the output M?\n Now, here is a nested for loop which does the same as the above code.\n    No wonder why they named Fortran \u201cFORmula TRANslator\u201d in the first place.Interestingly, the Julia syntax is exactly similar in this regard.\n So even though I agree with the idea than Python is a beautiful language to work with,I don\u2019t think the same holds for Numpy. Yes, Numpy allows us to stay within a Python framework and get things donewith simple one-liners (which is pretty neat anyway) but the resulting Numpycode becomes hard to read afterward.\n  I believe there is no such thing as a definitive benchmark. Running a seriesof completely unrelated tests of toy problems, and claiming that a certain languageis overall the best because it does well in most of the tests,is meaningless if we are interested in certain specific and more realisticcases.\n Rather than trying to rely on big, all-purpose benchmarks, I believe it is preferable to run,from time to time, some micro-benchmarks suited to our own projects.\n If we can predict what the major performance bottlenecks of our code will be,major performance bottleneck of our codeWe can then come up with a minimalistic, but spot-on example, and create a specific performancetest that suits our needs.\n In my numerical projects, for example, I do a lot of array operations and I evaluate a lot of complex exponentials.So that\u2019s why this test is about just that. My benchmark was already described above,it\u2019s just: given a vector a, form the matrix\n   All tests were run in an Intel i7-4700MQ CPU (3.40 GHz, 6MB of Cache)with 8 GB of DDR3 RAM\n   function eval_exp(N) a = range(0, stop=2*pi, length=N) A = Matrix{ComplexF64}(undef, N, N) @inbounds  [email\u00a0protected] for j in 1:N for i in 1:N A[i,j] = exp((100+im)*im*sqrt(a[i]^2 + a[j]^2)) end end return Aendeval_exp(5)print(string(&#34;running loop on &#34;, Threads.nthreads(), &#34; threads \\n&#34;))for N in 1000:1000:10000 @time begin A = eval_exp(N) endend\n   note: ST and MT stand for single-threaded and multithreaded,respectively. Note that in all cases, the fast-math optimization flag was used, which allows compilers to reorder mathematical expressions to obtain accuracy, but in a way that could break IEEE compliance.\n  Interestingly, from the above table, we can compute the threading efficiency,that is, the speed-up factor when moving from single to multithreading.\n  In a quad-core CPU, Julia\u2019s Multithreading efficiency is about 4.9,whereas when relying on gfortran and OpenMP, we get about 3.6. So Julia is effectively taking advantage of hyperthreading, somethingwhich is rarely seen in OpenMP.\n    It turns out that Julia has further tools to increase performance. One of such toolsis LoopVectorization.jl\n As suggested by Mason in  this topicof the JuliaLang forum, at least the single-threaded version can besped up quite significantly by resorting to that library.\n I\u2019ll continue to dig deeper on how to skeeze the last bit of performanceout of computer hardware by resorting to Julia. Stay tuned!\n  Why is Fortran still used. I had a fair degree of experience with Fortran, and I believe there are solid reasons to use Fortran for scientific computing today.\n Will Julia Replace Fortran in HPC?. However, afeter comparing Fortran with Julia on various grounds, I tend to think that, over time, Julia seems on track to superseed Fortran, even in the HPC niche.\n I&#39;m Martin D.

the history of life took place. A primitive bacterium was engulfed by our oldest ancestor \u2014 a solo, free-floating cell. The two fused to form a mutually beneficial relationship that has lasted more than a billion years, with the latter providing a safe, comfortable home and the former becoming a powerhouse, fueling the processes necessary to maintain life.\n  That\u2019s the best hypothesis to date for how the cellular components, or organelles, known as mitochondria came to be. Today, trillions of these bacterial descendants live within our bodies, churning out ATP, the molecular energy source that sustains our cells. Despite being inextricably integrated into the machinery of the human body, mitochondria also carry remnants of their bacterial past, such as their own set of DNA.\n    These features make mitochondria both a critical element of our cells and a potential source of problems. Like the DNA inside the nuclei of our cells that makes up the human genome, mitochondrial DNA can harbor mutations. Age, stress and other factors may disrupt mitochondria\u2019s many functions. On top of that, mitochondrial injury can release molecules that, due to their similarities to those made by bacteria, can be mistaken by our immune system as foreign invaders, triggering a harmful inflammatory response against our own cells.\n  There is one organ that appears to be particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial damage: our power-hungry brains.\u00a0\u201cThe more energetically demanding a cell is, the more mitochondria they have, and the more critical that mitochondria health is \u2014 so there\u2019s more potential for things to go wrong,\u201d says Andrew Moehlman, postdoctoral researcher who studies neurodegeneration at the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). According to some estimates, each neuron can have up to 2 million mitochondria.\n  A small but growing number of scientists are now turning their attention to the contributions of mitochondria in brain health. Studies in humans and lab animals \u2014 though much of it still preliminary \u2014 suggest these organelles could be key players in virtually every type of brain disorder, including neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism, psychiatric illnesses like depression and schizophrenia, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s. They may even be at the heart of an enduring mystery for researchers who study brain disorders: how genetic predispositions and environmental influences interact to put people at risk for developing these conditions.\n    In the 1960s, researchers discovered that mitochondria possess a unique set of genetic material. Investigations revealed that mitochondrial DNA, like that of bacteria, forms a circular strand and encodes just 37 genes \u2014 a mere fraction of the tens of thousands found in the human genome.\n  A short time later, in the 1970s, a doctoral student at Yale University named Douglas Wallace developed an interest in mitochondria DNA. Wallace reasoned that since mitochondria were the primary producers of the body\u2019s energy, mutations in their DNA would lead to disease. \u201cAt the time no one thought it was rational,\u201d he says. It wasn\u2019t until 1988, when Wallace and his colleagues established the first link between a mutation in mitochondrial DNA and a human disease \u2014 Leber\u2019s hereditary optic neuropathy, a condition that causes sudden blindness \u2014 that medical researchers began to take the idea seriously, Wallace recalls.\n  Researchers have since linked dozens of disorders to alterations in mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA related to mitochondrial function \u2014 and interestingly, the majority of these are either neurological in nature or have some effect on the brain. Wallace, who is now director of the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia\u2019s Center for Mitochondrial and Epigenomic Medicine, has a simple explanation: Despite making up only 2 percent of a human\u2019s body weight, the brain uses roughly a fifth of the body\u2019s energy. In the same way that high-energy appliances will be disproportionately affected when voltage levels drop during a metropolitan brownout, even small reductions in mitochondrial function can have large effects on the brain, Wallace says.\n  Wallace is particularly interested in how mitochondria might contribute to autism spectrum disorder. Studies by several research teams have revealed that\u00a0 mitochondrial diseases, a mix of symptoms caused by defects in the organelle, are much more prevalent in people with autism (5 percent) than in the general population (about 0.01 percent). An additional 30 percent to 50 percent of children with autism show signs of mitochondrial dysfunction, such as abnormal levels of certain byproducts generated by cellular respiration, the process through which ATP is produced.\n  In some people with autism, scientists have identified genetic differences either in mitochondrial DNA, or in some of the thousand or so genes in the human genome known to influence mitochondrial function. More work is needed to establish whether these genetic variations actually cause or contribute to autism, but a recent study with mice hints that there could be a link. Wallace and colleagues reported earlier this year in\u00a0 PNAS\u00a0that a specific mutation in mitochondrial DNA can lead to autism-like traits in mice, including impaired social interactions, skittishness and compulsive behavior.\n  Genetic alterations aren\u2019t the only way mitochondria could contribute to autism. Certain environmental factors, such as toxic pollutants, have been associated with a higher risk of developing the condition. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist and autism researcher at the Phoenix Children\u2019s Hospital in Arizona, and his colleagues have found that such factors may also perturb the health of mitochondria in people with autism. In one study, they found that the amount of air pollution that children with autism were exposed to before birth altered the rates at which their mitochondria produced ATP. In another, the researchers found correlations between early-life exposure to both nutritional metals such as zinc as well as toxic metals such as lead, and how well the organelles functioned in those with autism later in life. Together, Frye says, these findings suggest that mitochondria be the missing link between autism and the environmental influences that contribute to the condition.\n  \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to make any firm conclusions about a lot of this stuff, but it sure looks like the mitochondria are disrupted in many kids with autism,\u201d Frye says. \u201cAnd environmental exposures, especially early on, may be programming the mitochondria to have different types of respiratory physiology.\u201d\n  Researchers have also found signs of mitochondrial dysfunction, such as disturbances in the way they metabolize sugars to create energy, in people with schizophrenia and depression. In addition, studies also suggest that mitochondria may be sensitive to a risk factor for many mental illnesses: psychological stress in early life. For example, people who experience a traumatic event in childhood appear to have a larger number of mitochondrial genomes per cell. This uptick in mitochondrial DNA \u2014 which can indicate the formation of new mitochondria \u2014 may occur to compensate for problems in the organelle, according to Teresa Daniels, a biological psychiatry researcher at Brown University, where she is working on addressing this question. Daniels is a coauthor of a 2020 paper in the\u00a0 Annual Review of Clinical Psychology\u00a0that discusses the\u00a0 role of mitochondria in psychiatric disorders.\n  Although mitochondrial dysfunction appears in a wide range of brain disorders, it\u2019s not yet clear whether defects in these organelles are a primary cause of these conditions or a secondary effect, says Robert McCullumsmith, a physician-scientist at the University of Toledo who studies brain disorders but is not involved in the work on mitochondria. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem,\u201d he says. However, McCullumsmith adds, studying the role of mitochondria in these disorders is important, and he sees promising evidence that therapeutics that target mitochondria may end up benefiting patients, even if they don\u2019t cure these conditions.\n    When mitochondria become damaged or dysfunctional, one consequence is simply less ATP, and therefore less energy for the normal operations of the brain. But another way mitochondria could contribute to brain disorders stems from their ancestral past.\n  As descendants of bacteria, mitochondria have DNA and other components that can be released when cells are injured or stressed and mistaken by our immune system as a foreign threat. In 2010, researchers at Harvard University reported a rapid release of mitochondrial DNA into the bloodstream in people with severe physical injuries \u2014 such as fractures or hemorrhages caused by a car crash. This, in turn, attracted immune cells and triggered a severe inflammatory response that mimicked sepsis \u2014 a life-threatening condition in which the immune system attacks the body\u2019s own tissues.\n  A few years later, A. Phillip West, who was then a postdoc at Yale University, and his colleagues showed that DNA can leak out of mitochondria and activate the immune system even in the absence of such severe injuries \u2014 for example, when the organelles became deficient in a key protein.\n  Inflammation caused by the release of mitochondrial DNA may contribute to the damage found in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), according to a growing number of studies. In separate lines of research, scientists have linked these disorders with both inflammation and an inability to properly rid cells of defective mitochondria. Mitochondria-triggered inflammation may be the missing link between the two.\n  For example, mutations in two genes associated with some forms of inherited Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2014\u00a0 PINK1\u00a0and\u00a0 PRKN\u00a0\u2014 lead to problems in the process through which damaged mitochondria are broken down and cleared from the cell. In 2019, a group led by Richard Youle at the NINDS demonstrated that in mice with mutations in\u00a0 PINK1\u00a0and\u00a0 PRKN, inducing mitochondrial damage (either through exhaustive exercise or by altering mitochondrial DNA) activated inflammatory molecules. Those animals also lost dopamine-producing neurons in their brains and developed problems with movement \u2014 hallmarks of Parkinson\u2019s disease. These effects didn\u2019t occur, however, when the researchers repeated the experiment with mice engineered to lack an important inflammatory molecule. Together, these findings illustrated that in animals genetically predisposed to Parkinson\u2019s, either stress or glitches in mitochondrial DNA could trigger the inflammation that promotes the disease.\n    Although more work is needed to establish whether the same process occurs in humans, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of evidence that the failure to maintain the healthy mitochondria is one of the early pathological events that leads to development of Parkinson\u2019s symptoms,\u201d says Moehlman, who coauthored a 2020 paper in the \u00a0Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology\u00a0with Youle that discusses how\u00a0 problems in mitochondria may lead to neurodegeneration.\n  As evidence mounts that leaking mitochondrial DNA is bad news, some researchers are turning their attention to why. Many processes may be at play, says West, who is now an immunobiologist Texas A&amp;M University. One scenario, he says, is that the organelle ejects constant, low levels of DNA over time \u2014 and when exacerbated by genetic or environmental factors, this accumulation can reach a threshold where diseases occur.\n  Psychological stress could be one such factor. In a 2019 study, Martin Picard, a mitochondrial psychobiologist at Columbia University, and his colleagues reported that after a brief public-speaking task where participants were asked to defend themselves against an alleged transgression, levels of free-floating mitochondrial DNA in the bloodstream rose, indicating that the mitochondria had expelled their genetic material.\n  This sort of mitochondrial damage and DNA release could contribute to human diseases where inflammation appears to play a role, even in the absence of an infection, such as cancer, autoimmune conditions and neurodegenerative disorders, West says.\n  He and others also suspect that mitochondria-induced inflammation may be a key driver of aging itself. In a recent study, West\u2019s team demonstrated that mice engineered to have unstable mitochondrial DNA aged more quickly, developing problems such as hair and bone loss and dying prematurely. Eliminating the elements of the immune system activated by mitochondria DNA reversed this process, extending the animals\u2019 lifespans by around 40 days. (These results were posted before publication on bioRxiv and have yet to be peer-reviewed.) If future research bears this out, it would provide evidence that aging, in these mice at least, is partly driven by mitochondrial damage, West says.\n    Mitochondria have other functions that help maintain healthy brain function \u2014 or cause problems when they go awry. For example, mitochondria help control the balance of potentially toxic byproducts of cellular metabolism called reactive oxygen species and the synthesis of stress hormones like cortisol. Mitochondria are also highly dynamic \u2014 communicating with each other via signaling molecules and physical connections. They continuously undergo fission, where a large mitochondrion splits into two smaller ones, or fusion, when they combine. These ongoing interactions may also influence brain function and behavior in ways that researchers are only beginning to realize.\n  Carmen Sandi, a behavioral neuroscientist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, and her group have examined mitochondria in mice with high levels of anxiety-like behaviors, such as less willingness to spend time in open areas. They\u2019ve found that in those animals, mitochondria in the neurons of the nucleus accumbens, a brain area involved in processing reward, were less adept at producing ATP compared to those found in animals that displayed lower levels of anxiety. The high-anxiety animals also displayed lower levels of an enzyme involved in fusion \u2014 which enables mitochondria to combine and mix their contents to support one another in times of need. Increasing the level of this protein not only restored mitochondrial function, but also reduced anxious behaviors, the researchers found.\n  Findings like these give scientists reason to hope they may one day be able to develop treatments for brain disorders that target these organelles. Frye, for example, recently began a clinical trial to investigate whether nutrient supplements can reverse the mitochondrial abnormalities his team has found in children with autism. Wallace adds that researchers already know of many potential\u00a0 treatments\u00a0that help boost the function of mitochondria \u2014 from medications to behavioral interventions, such as\u00a0 exercise.\n  It will take time to test such interventions. For now, scientists are busy unraveling the multitude of functions mitochondria have in the brain. Much of this work is still preliminary, but evidence coming from a variety of disciplines \u2014 including neuroscience, immunology and psychology \u2014 has scientists excited about the future.

We can also loosely tie these cohorts to their anticipated cloud spend; identify typical tasks each user cohort is responsible for completing; assess compute and storage requirements for each user cohort; and estimate cohort size, based on survey responses.\n  Survey respondents are overwhelmingly performing  exploratory analysis using small- to medium-sized data sets stored as flat files, on local machines. Machine learning projects \u2013 if ML is being attempted at all \u2013 are in  early stages, using traditional methods that are best-suited for  high-RAM CPU rather than GPU SKUs (ex: scikit-learn and clustering approaches).\n Based on responses,  data science teams trend small (0-5 engineers), with light rigor on SDLC best practices (ex: version control); and  most data scientists come from non-CS backgrounds, with minimal programming experience. Preferred tools are overwhelmingly  open-source and non-proprietary. If Visual Studio Code is being used by survey respondents, it is most often being used for  non-interactive, production machine learning and data science work.\n   Annual survey of 6-7M registered Kaggle users. Kaggle is the world\u2019s largest online community for machine learning and data science.\n Annual survey of StackOverflow users. Not domain-specific; ~8% of respondents indicated doing data-affiliate work (data science, ML, research).\n Annual survey of Python developers, completed in partnership between the PSF and JetBrains. Not data science and ML-specific, though ~50% of respondents indicate they use Python for EDA.\n Focused survey for data analysts and ML engineers administered by Anaconda. Data not released publicly; but an executive summary is available.\n Not a domain-specific survey, and not segmented out by tools used. More than half of ML and data science respondents (5K) are hobbyists and students, and just learning how to do ML; not professionals.\n Given the focused nature of the two survey instruments,  the Anaconda survey and the Kaggle surveys were both selected as the most useful for the purpose of this analysis. The data science and machine learning respondents from the Python Developers Survey (55% of total); the professional data science and machine learning respondents for the SlashData Survey (25% of total); and the data science respondents from the StackOverflow Developer Survey (8% of total) are used as supplemental evidence.\n Though just under a third of total respondents for the Kaggle Survey and the PSF Survey indicated that they were using VS Code, this was found -- through qualitative interviews, as well as from social media scraping and Github issues analysis -- not to be for exploratory data analysis or interactive model building, but rather for  machine learning model deployment; for  other types of software development or Python library building; or for  lightweight editing of Python and markdown files.\n  The data is available to  view via Github&#39;s Flat Data, and to download from the Kaggle website.\n  The Kaggle survey data was cleaned, and then one-hot encoded for each developer tool based on survey responses. Tools used by less than 10% of respondents were removed from the dataset. We then used UMAP clustering with nearest neighbors of 32 to define clusters of users; six distinct clusters were found and translated into cohorts, with no apparent correlation to self-assigned role title.\n  Clusters were validated with the qualitative data in the Anaconda Data Science Survey, as well as with blog and social media posts; StackOverflow issues; and Github issues (for example: ML Ops engineers tend to have backgrounds that fall more commonly on the &#34;software engineering&#34; side of the spectrum).\n  Primary findings from the aggregated survey responses can be found below. The numbers adjacent to each bullet point indicate which survey above (1 through 5) supports each assessment.\n  Many of the survey respondents  do not have a computer science background, but have been trained in some other domain (physical, natural or biological sciences; statistics; etc.) -- often obtaining a graduate or professional degree. [1,2,3,4]\n Most survey respondents have been  programming for less than a decade, and have less than three years of experience with machine learning or software engineering. [1,4]\n The majority of survey respondents  work in small teams (0-5 engineers), or in large communities of practice (20+ engineers). These data scientists are not likely to be using version control systems; but do often  indicate using GitHub as both a place to find code for their experiments, and a way to showcase their work. [1,4,5]\n Most survey respondents appear to be in their  late 20s or early 30s, with 60% between 22 and 34. Only 20% are above the age of 40; and there are signs of the numbers skewing even younger, as Generation Z becomes more involved with data science and machine learning work.  Nearly 7% of Kaggle survey data scientists are aged 18-21, an increase from 5% in 2019. [1,2,4,5]\n  Jupyter products (JupyterLab and original Jupyter notebooks)  are the overwhelming winner in terms of IDE use (74.1%), with VS Code, PyCharm, and RStudio neck-in-neck for second place (all around 32%).  It is common for survey respondents to use more than one development environment. [1,2,3,4,5]\n Survey respondents prefer having a  quick scratchpad that is automatically connected to data sources and does not require manual authentication. Though free-tier hosted notebooks (ex: Colab, Binder) are used by a subset of respondents, hosting and sharing code externally is not a P0. [1,4]\n  Most survey respondents are using  small to medium-sized data sets that can fit in memory. [1,4]\n These data sets are usually comprised of  local flat files (CSVs, JSON, etc.), or tables exported from relational databases. Data lakes and non-SQL databases are rarely used, if ever. [1,4]\n Preferred databases are primarily open-source ( PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.), though a significant number of users are opting for Microsoft SQL Server. [1]\n Exploratory data analysis is a significant component of both data science and machine learning work; and is usually done using open-source libraries.  Please note: EDA is distinct from and a precursor to ETL pipeline-building.[1,4]\n Little to no exploratory data analysis is being done using large clusters of machines (Spark, Dask). If these tools are used, it is most commonly by the cohorts that are described in the table below as ML Ops professionals, data engineers, or deep learning engineers. [1,4]\n  Most survey respondents are doing either  exploratory data analysis, or traditional machine learning with scikit-learn. These models are most commonly logistic and linear regression; random forests and decision trees; Bayesian methods; and gradient boosted trees. [1,3,4]\n It is common for data scientists to use more than one language \u2013 and the usual suspects are  R, Python, and SQL. [1,2,3,4,5]\n Most survey respondents  are not using automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques, or experiment management and model orchestration tools (ex: Weights &amp; Biases, MLFlow). [1,4]\n  Most survey respondents are  not yet using machine learning in production, though that number is steadily increasing year over year (28.9% in 2019 compared to 30.8% in 2020). [1,4,5]\n Most survey respondents are  not yet using self-hosted cloud technologies, though they often leverage third-party hosted notebooks (ex: Colab, Binder). [1]\n Segmenting out Kaggle survey respondents who indicated spending more than $100K (n = 729) on cloud resources, we find that:\n There are a substantial number of respondents using Power BI and Tableau (22% and 30%, respectively).\n Azure jumps to second place (31%) for survey respondents who indicate that they spend more than $100K on cloud resources. For survey respondents in aggregate, the second most popular cloud is GCP. The most popular cloud for both segments is AWS.\n Large-scale cloud customers have even less of a focus on deep learning; if they are using machine learning at all, they are using traditional models.\n Only half of large-scale cloud compute users (49%) are using GPUs - and, even for those users, those GPUs are local.\n Survey respondents who indicated spending $100K or more on cloud resources were more likely to be tenured employees (5+ years of experience).\n The other data points still hold: VS Code is in a distant second place to Jupyter* as an IDE; flat files and relational databases still most common data sources; most teams don\u2019t have machine learning models running in production and are still exploring; etc.\n  The survey data described above has been used to create a customer cohort table (distilled view below).\n Please note: this table is not meant to be a comprehensive assessment of each of these cohort groups and the tools they used; just a brief overview. Additional blog posts with a deep dive for each group to follow.\n New to programming, data science, and machine learning. Canonical example would be high school and college students. Primary mechanism to learn is video content (Coursera, YouTube, EdX, etc.).\n New to data science and ML, and just beginning to learn.
