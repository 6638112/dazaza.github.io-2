I’ve been learning how to speak English again, and you’ll see I still can’t come up with the right words sometimes.” The most influential business thinker on earth looked up and smiled apologetically. He stood with his hands in his pockets. His hair was neatly parted on the side. He was very tall. “I have a tendency to speak to the floor,” he said. “It’s because if I look at you, you distract me.”</p><p>“从我的说话方式可以看出，我大约十八个月前中风了。我一直在学习如何再次说英语，您会发现有时我仍然无法提出正确的单词。”地球上最有影响力的商业思想家抬头笑着道歉。他双手插在口袋里站着。他的头发在侧面整齐地分开了。他很高。他说：“我倾向于在地板上讲话。” “这是因为如果我看着你，你会分散我的注意力。”</p><p> Clayton Christensen liked to feel a connection with people he was trying to help, whether he was giving a talk in church or to a business group like this one, so it was too bad he had to look at the floor, but he would do his best. He was pretty sure he’d find the words, because he was going to tell a story he knew by heart. He had told it to thousands and thousands of people, ever since his first book, “The Innovator’s Dilemma,” came out, fifteen years ago. Yet somehow, and he was so grateful for this, still more people seemed to want him to tell it—seemed to think that the puzzle it posed, and the answer he’d come up with, would save them from ruin.</p><p> 克莱顿·克里斯滕森（Clayton Christensen）喜欢与自己想要帮助的人建立联系，无论他是在教堂里演讲还是在像这样的商业团体中演讲，因此他不得不看着地板实在是太可惜了，但是他会尽自己的本分。最好。他非常确定自己会找到这些单词，因为他要讲一个他心中知道的故事。自从15年前出版第一本书《创新者的困境》以来，他就已经将它告诉了成千上万的人。然而，不知何故，他对此深表谢意，似乎还有更多的人希望他告诉他-似乎认为它带来的难题以及他想出的答案将使他们免于破产。</p><p> He pointed his clicker at the screen and the first slide appeared. “For those of you who haven’t made a lot of steel, historically there are two ways to make it,” he said. “Most of the world’s steel has been made by massive integrated steel companies. The other way to do it is to build a mini mill. In a mini mill, you melt scrap in electric furnaces, and you could easily fit four of them in this room. The most important thing about a mini mill is that you can make steel for twenty per cent lower cost than you can make it in an integrated mill. Now, imagine you’re the C.E.O. of a steel company somewhere. In a really good year, your net profit will be two to four per cent. Here is a technology that would reduce the cost of making steel by twenty per cent. Don’t you think you’d adopt it? And yet  not a single integrated steel company, anywhere in the world, built a mini mill. Today, all but one of the integrated mills have gone bankrupt. So here is why something that makes consummate sense can be impossible for smart people to do.”</p><p> 他将点击器指向屏幕，出现了第一张幻灯片。他说：“从历史上看，对于那些没有大量制造钢材的人来说，有两种制造方法。” “世界上大部分钢铁都是由大型综合钢铁公司生产的。另一种方法是建造一个小型轧机。在小型磨机中，您将废料放在电炉中融化，您可以轻松地将其中的四个放到这个房间中。微型轧机最重要的一点是，与整合式轧机相比，您可以以比钢材低20％的成本生产钢材。现在，假设您是C.E.O.某处的钢铁公司。在非常好的一年中，您的净利润将达到2-4％。这是一种可以将钢铁制造成本降低20％的技术。您不认为您会采用它吗？但是，在世界任何地方，没有一家综合性钢铁公司建立了小型轧机。今天，除一家综合工厂外，其他所有企业都破产了。因此，这就是为什么明智的人无法做到有意义的事情。”</p><p>  The question he’d begun with, twenty years ago, was: Why was success so difficult to sustain? How was it that big, rich companies, admired and emulated by everyone, could one year be at the peak of their power and, just a few years later, be struggling in the middle of the pack or just plain gone? He had initially assumed that technology moved on, and the older players couldn’t keep up. But when he began to look into it he found that this wasn’t so: as technologies grew more sophisticated, whether by small improvements or radical leaps, the established companies, with their well-funded R. &amp; D. departments, nearly always led the way.</p><p>  他二十年前开始的问题是：为什么成功如此难以维持？每个人都钦佩和效仿的大型，富裕的公司，怎么可能在一年内达到其实力的顶峰，而仅仅几年后，却在困境中挣扎还是一去不复返了？他最初以为技术在不断发展，而年龄较大的参与者无法跟上步伐。但是当他开始研究时，却发现事实并非如此：随着技术变得越来越复杂，无论是通过小幅改进还是大幅度的飞跃，老牌公司及其资金雄厚的研发部门几乎总是领导着方式。</p><p>  Some people thought it was a matter of bad leadership—stupid managers grown too cautious or complacent to change. But Christensen was a generous man; he didn’t like to call people stupid, and, besides, the very same managers who were being called stupid today had been called geniuses last week, when the company was doing well and they were doing exactly what they were doing now.</p><p>  有人认为这是领导能力低下的问题-愚蠢的经理变得过于谨慎或自满以至于无法改变。但是克里斯滕森是个大方的人。他不喜欢叫人愚蠢，此外，上周，当今天公司被称为愚蠢的那些经理被称为天才，当时公司运作良好，他们正在做自己现在正在做的事情。</p><p> “In the steel industry, as in your industry, there are tiers in the market,” he said. “At the bottom of the market is concrete reinforcing bar”—rebar. “Anyone can make rebar, but steel used to make appliances and cars”—sheet steel, at the top of the market—“is really tough to make. In the beginning, the mini mills were making steel from scrap, so the quality was crummy. The only market that would buy what the mini mills made was the rebar market, because there are almost no specs for rebar, and once you’ve buried it in cement you can’t verify if it made them anyway, so it was just the perfect market for a crummy product.</p><p> 他说：“在钢铁行业中，就像在您的行业中一样，市场存在多个层次。” “钢筋是市场的底部”。 “任何人都可以制造螺纹钢，但用于制造家用电器和汽车的钢材”（市场最高处的薄钢板）确实很难制造。最初，小型钢厂是用废钢制造的，因此质量很差。唯一可以购买小型钢厂制成品的市场是螺纹钢市场，因为几乎没有螺纹钢规格，一旦将其埋入水泥中，就无法验证它是否能制成螺纹钢，因此这仅仅是柔软产品的理想市场。</p><p>  “As the mini mills attacked the rebar market, the reaction from the integrated mills was, man, they were happy to get out of rebar, because it was truly a dog-eat-dog commodity, and why would they ever want to defend the least profitable part of their business when, if they focussed their assets on angle iron and thicker bar and rod, the margins”—twelve per cent—“were so much better? So, as the mini mills expanded their capacity to make rebar, the integrated mills shut those lines down, and, as they chopped off the lowest-margin part of the product lines, their gross-margin profitability improved.”</p><p>  “当小型钢厂攻入螺纹钢市场时，综合钢厂的反应是，男人，他们很乐意退出螺纹钢，因为这确实是一条吃不完的商品，为什么他们要捍卫螺纹钢呢？如果他们将资产集中在角铁和较厚的棒材和棒材上，那么利润率（占12％）会好得多吗？因此，随着小型钢厂扩大生产螺纹钢的能力，综合钢厂关闭了这些生产线，并且由于砍掉了产品线中利润最低的部分，毛利率提高了。”</p><p> The first industry that Christensen studied was disk drives. He had started out in consulting, then co-founded an advanced-materials firm called C.P.S. Technologies, but then he decided to follow the academic track that led to his becoming a professor at Harvard Business School. Someone told him that disk drives were the fruit flies of technology: they were ideal subjects for studying evolution, because a generation in disk-drive technology was incredibly short. He saw that the companies that made fourteen-inch drives for mainframe computers had been driven out of business by companies that made eight-inch drives for mini computers, and then the companies that made the eight-inch drives were driven out of business by companies that made 5.25-inch drives for PCs. What was puzzling about this was that the eight-inch drives weren’t as good as the fourteen-inch drives—they had a lower capacity, and a higher cost per megabyte—and the 5.25-inch drives were inferior to the eight-inch drives. So why hadn’t the fourteen-inch-drive companies simply started producing eight-inch drives? It didn’t make sense.</p><p>Christensen研究的第一个行业是磁盘驱动器。他最初从事咨询工作，然后共同创立了一家名为C.P.S.的先进材料公司。科技，但后来他决定遵循学术道路，成为哈佛商学院的教授。有人告诉他，磁盘驱动器是技术的果蝇：它们是研究进化的理想学科，因为一代磁盘驱动器技术非常短。他发现制造大型计算机14英寸驱动器的公司被微型计算机8英寸驱动器的公司淘汰，然后制造8英寸驱动器的公司被公司淘汰。制造了用于PC的5.25英寸驱动器。令人困惑的是，八英寸驱动器不如十四英寸驱动器好-它们具有较低的容量，每兆字节的成本更高-并且5.25英寸驱动器不如八英寸驱动器驱动器。那么为什么十四英寸驱动器公司不只是开始生产八英寸驱动器呢？没有道理</p><p> Around the same time, Christensen happened to remember that in 1962, during the Cuban missile crisis, a neighbor had brought in a big, powerful steam shovel to build a bomb shelter in her back yard, and he thought, Gee, you don’t see those big excavators anymore—you only see hydraulic backhoes. I wonder if the same thing happened to the excavators as happened to fourteen-inch disk drives? Sure enough, he discovered that although the hydraulic backhoe was used only for tiny jobs when it was first introduced—it was so weak, and its reach so short, that the only thing it was better than was a man with a shovel—over the years it had got better and better until, at last, it put the big excavators out of business.</p><p> 大约在同一时间，克里斯滕森（Christensen）碰巧记得，在1962年古巴导弹危机期间，一个邻居带了一个大而有力的蒸汽铲在她的后院建起防空洞，他想，Ge，你不是不再需要那些大型挖掘机了，您只能看到液压挖掘机。我想知道挖掘机是否发生了与14英寸磁盘驱动器相同的事情？果然，他发现，虽然液压反铲刚推出时仅用于微小的工作，但是它却很脆弱，而且作用距离很短，以至于唯一的事情是比有铲子的人还要好。几年来，它变得越来越好，直到最后，这台大型挖掘机停业了。</p><p> In industry after industry, Christensen discovered, the new technologies that had brought the big, established companies to their knees weren’t better or more advanced—they were actually  worse. The new products were low-end, dumb, shoddy, and in almost every way inferior. The customers of the big, established companies had no interest in them—why should they? They already had something better. But the new products were usually cheaper and easier to use, and so people or companies who were not rich or sophisticated enough for the old ones started buying the new ones, and there were so many more of the regular people than there were of the rich, sophisticated people that the companies making the new products prospered.</p><p> 克里斯滕森发现，一个行业接一个行业的新技术并没有更好或更先进，实际上却更糟。新产品低端，笨拙，伪劣，并且几乎在所有方面都逊色。大型的成熟公司的客户对它们不感兴趣，为什么要这么做？他们已经有了更好的东西。但是新产品通常更便宜且更易于使用，因此那些财力雄厚或能力不足以适应旧产品的人或公司开始购买新产品，普通人的数量比富人的要多。 ，生产新产品的公司蓬勃发展的老百姓。</p><p>  Another example he remembered from his own life was the transistor radio that Sony marketed in the nineteen-fifties. It was a terrible radio, you could barely make out the music for the static, and it had no chance of competing against the nice big RCA or Zenith consoles that middle-class families had on tables in their living rooms. But the transistors succeeded wildly at the bottom of the market, with the rebar of humanity: teen-agers. For teen-agers at that time, the alternative was nothing, and the transistor was better than that. Then, gradually, the transistors got better, and, by the time they got good enough to interest grownups, RCA and Zenith were too far behind to catch up. The same thing was happening now with phone cameras: when they first appeared, they took terrible pictures, but they were so convenient that people used them anyway, and over time they got better. Christensen called these low-end products “disruptive technologies,” because, rather than sustaining technological progress toward better performance, they disrupted it.</p><p>  他还记得自己生活中的另一个例子，那就是索尼在19世纪50年代销售的晶体管收音机。这是一个糟糕的收音机，您几乎无法分辨出静态音乐，也没有机会与中产阶级家庭在客厅桌上摆放的大型RCA或Zenith调音台竞争。但是，随着人类的发展，晶体管在市场的底部取得了巨大的成功：青少年。对于当时的青少年来说，别无选择，晶体管比这更好。然后，晶体管逐渐变得更好，并且当它们变得足够好以引起成年人的关注时，RCA和Zenith远远落后于追赶。手机摄像头现在也发生了同样的事情：当它们首次出现时，它们会拍摄出可怕的照片，但是它们是如此的方便以至于人们无论如何都使用它们，并且随着时间的推移它们会变得越来越好。 Christensen称这些低端产品为“颠覆性技术”，因为他们没有持续改善技术以取得更好的性能，而是破坏了它。</p><p> Christensen was himself a low-end kind of guy. He grew up poor, on the west side of Salt Lake City, which was the wrong side of the tracks. He collected paper tray liners from fast-food restaurants. For years, he drove a 1986 Chevy Nova that he barely fit in—there was a spot on the ceiling where his head would rub that always had a few hairs stuck to it. At home, he wouldn’t let food be thrown out: no matter how disgusting it had become, he would eat it, on principle. So if anyone was primed to be the champion of low-end products that triumphed because they were cheap and dumb and low-end people could use them, it was he.</p><p> 克里斯滕森本人是一个低端的家伙。他在盐湖城西边的穷人那里长大，那是铁轨的另一面。他从快餐店收集纸盒衬板。多年来，他开着一辆几乎不适合的1986雪佛兰新星-天花板上有一个擦头的地方，头上总是长着几根头发。在家里，他不会扔掉食物：无论食物变得多么令人恶心，他原则上都会吃掉。因此，如果有人因为低价，笨拙而低端的人可以使用它们而成为低端产品的冠军，那他就是他。</p><p>  The integrated mills and the mini mills were happy with each other until 1979. “That was the year that the mini mills succeeded in driving the last of the integrated mills out of rebar,” Christensen said. “ Bam!—the price of rebar collapsed by twenty per cent. It turned out that there was a subtle fact that nobody had thought about, and that is that a low-cost strategy only works when you have a high-cost competitor. As soon as the integrated mills fled upmarket, it was just low-cost mini mill fighting against low-cost mini mill. So what were these poor suckers going to do? One of them looked upmarket and said, ‘Holy cow, if we could make better steel, we could make money again!’ So they attacked the next tier of the market. And the integrated mills? Man, were they happy to wash their hands of that business. Because it was truly such a dog-eat-dog commodity business, and why would you ever defend a twelve-per-cent-margin business when you could focus your assets upmarket on structural steel, where the eighteen-per-cent margins were so much more attractive? And so the very same thing happened again. And as the integrated mills lopped off the lowest part of their product line their profitability improved.”</p><p>  综合工厂和小型工厂彼此满意直到1979年。“那一年，小型工厂成功地将最后一个综合工厂从螺纹钢中撤出，”克里斯滕森说。 “ Bam！-螺纹钢的价格下跌了20％。事实证明，有一个微妙的事实，没有人考虑过，那就是低成本策略仅在拥有高成本竞争对手的情况下才有效。综合工厂一逃到高档市场，就只是低成本的小型工厂与低成本的小型工厂竞争。那么这些可怜的吸盘怎么办？他们中的一个看着高档市场，说道：“圣牛，如果我们能制造出更好的钢材，我们就能再次赚钱！”因此，他们袭击了市场的下一层。和综合工厂？伙计们，他们乐于洗手吗？因为这确实是一条令人a舌的大宗商品业务，为什么当您可以将您的资产集中在高端结构钢上时却会为利润率达到12％的业务辩护，而利润率却高达18％更具吸引力？因此，同样的事情又发生了。而且，随着综合工厂退出其产品线的最低部分，其盈利能力得到了提高。”</p><p>  Christensen didn’t blame big companies for moving upmarket. They had to grow a certain amount every year, so selling bad products at low margins (like rebar) was never going to seem like the sensible thing for them to do. And venturing into markets that barely existed (like teen-age radio consumers) didn’t seem sensible, either, because, without the benefit of hindsight, how could you tell the difference between a bad product poised to take over the nation and just a bad product? You couldn’t invest in every dumb thing that came along—you’d go bankrupt. The sensible thing for big companies to do was to pursue higher margins, or to wait until a new product’s market became visible enough to be analyzed and large enough to be interesting—but by then it was too late. Meanwhile, the big companies kept doing what they were supposed to, listening to their customers and improving their products in ways that mattered to those customers, until they had improved them too much, climbed so far upmarket that they sailed right off the upper-right-hand corner of the graph, adding more features and power and degrees of perfection than anyone could possibly use, and by that time the bad, cheap, low-end product had improved to the point where it could finally appeal to the big companies’ customers, and the big companies failed.</p><p>  克里斯滕森（Christensen）并没有责怪大公司转移高端市场。他们每年必须增长一定的数量，因此以低利润出售劣质产品（如螺纹钢）对他们而言似乎从来都不是明智之举。而且，冒险进入几乎不存在的市场（如青少年无线电消费者）似乎也不明智，因为如果没有事后的见识，您怎么能分辨劣势产品准备接管国家的区别？不好的产品？您无法投资所有随之而来的愚蠢事物，否则您将破产。对于大公司而言，明智的做法是追求更高的利润率，或者等到新产品的市场变得足够可见以便进行分析并且足够大以至于引起人们的兴趣时，但是那时还为时已晚。同时，大公司继续做他们应该做的事情，听取客户的意见，并以对客户重要的方式改进产品，直到他们对产品进行了太多改进，爬到了高端市场，以至于他们从右上角航行图表的右上角，增加了任何人都无法使用的功能，强大的功能和完善的程度，到那时，劣质，廉价，低端的产品已经改善到可以最终吸引大公司客户，大公司失败了。</p><p> “Toyota did not come to America with Lexuses,” Christensen said. “They came with this rusty little subcompact in the sixties that they called the Corona. And then they went from the Corona to the Corolla, Tercel, 4Runner, and  then a Lexus. General Motors and Ford were up here on the integrated-steel trajectory, making big cars for big people. They’d look at Toyota coming at them from the bottom and say, You know, we ought to go get those buggers, and they’d send down a Chevette or a Pinto. But why would they keep making little subcompacts when they could be making bigger cars for bigger people? It just made no sense.”</p><p>克里斯滕森说：“丰田没有和雷克萨斯一起来到美国。” “在60年代，他们带来了这种生锈的小型微型仪器，他们称之为电晕。然后他们从电晕到花冠，Tercel，4Runner，然后是雷克萨斯。通用汽车和福特汽车走在综合钢轨上，为大人们制造大型汽车。他们会看着丰田从底部向他们冲来，并说，您知道，我们应该去找那些虫子，然后他们会派出雪佛兰（Chevette）或平托（Pinto）。但是，当他们可以为更大的人生产更大的汽车时，为什么他们会继续制造很小的微型汽车呢？只是没有道理。”</p><p>  After studying a few exceptions to the pattern of disruption, Christensen concluded that the only way a big company could avoid being disrupted was to set up a small spinoff company, somewhere far away from headquarters, that would function as a start-up, make the new low-end product, and be independent enough to ignore what counted as sensible for the mother ship. But truly independent spinoffs like these were rarely created. Why would you hire an entirely new staff—a new marketing department, for instance—when you already had a crackerjack marketing department that would keep costs down and margins up? And why would you open a new factory far away, where its managers couldn’t benefit from your expert advice? Now, having done his research, Christensen could tell you that getting away from your expert advice was exactly the reason that creating a spinoff was necessary. But why had so many managers, people just as smart as he was, failed to see what he saw? Why had they all fallen into the same trap?</p><p>  在研究了一些关于破坏模式的例外之后，克里斯滕森得出结论，大公司避免被破坏的唯一方法是在距离总部很远的地方成立一家小型的分拆公司，该公司可以作为一家初创公司，使公司新的低端产品，并具有足够的独立性，可以忽略对母舰而言明智的选择。但是很少有像这样的真正独立的衍生产品。当您已经有一个精打细算的营销部门可以降低成本并提高利润率时，为什么还要雇用一个全新的员工​​（例如新的营销部门）呢？又为什么您要在不开专家的建议的情况下在不远的地方开设新工厂呢？现在，克里斯滕森（Christensen）在完成研究后可以告诉您，摆脱专家建议的确恰恰是创建附带利益的必要原因。但是，为什么有这么多的经理，像他一样聪明的人，却看不到他所看到的呢？他们为什么都陷入同一个陷阱？</p><p>  After puzzling over this mystery for a long time, he finally came up with the answer: it was owing to the way the managers had learned to measure success. Success was now measured not in numbers of dollars but in ratios. Whether it was return on net assets, or gross-margin percentage, or internal rate of return, all these measures had, in the past forty years, been enshrined into a near-religion (he liked to call it the Church of New Finance) by partners in hedge funds and venture-capital firms and finance professors in business schools. People had come to think that the most important thing was not how much profit you made in absolute terms but what percentage of profit you made on each dollar you put in. And that belief drove managers to shed high-volume but low-margin products from their balance sheets, even though nobody had ever come across a bank that accepted deposits in ratios. This was why he called it a church: it was an encompassing orthodoxy that made it impossible for believers to see that it might be wrong.</p><p>  在迷惑了很长时间之后，他终于想出了答案：这是由于管理者学会了衡量成功的方法。现在，成功的衡量标准不是美元，而是比率。无论是净资产收益率，毛利率百分比还是内部收益率，在过去的四十年中，所有这些措施都被纳入了近乎宗教的信仰（他喜欢称其为新金融教会）对冲基金的合伙人，风险投资公司和商学院的金融教授。人们开始认为，最重要的不是您绝对赚取了多少利润，而是每投入一美元所赚取的利润百分比。这种信念驱使经理们抛弃了大批量但低利润的产品即使没有人遇到过接受按比例存款的银行。这就是为什么他称其为教堂：这是一个包罗万象的正统观念，这使信徒们不可能看到这可能是错的。</p><p>  One of the first C.E.O.s to understand the significance of Christensen’s idea was Andy Grove, the C.E.O. of Intel. Grove heard about it even before Christensen published “The Innovator’s Dilemma,” in 1997. Grove had sensed that something was moving around at the bottom of his industry, and he knew that this something was threatening to him, but he didn’t have the language to explain it precisely to himself, or to communicate to his people why they should worry about it. He asked Christensen to come out to Intel, and Christensen told him about the integrated mills and the mini mills, and right away Grove knew this was the story he’d been looking for. He had Christensen tell the same story to his staff, and “rebar” became a company mantra. Intel brought out the Celeron chip, a cheap product that was ideal for the new low-end PCs, and within a year it had captured thirty-five per cent of the market. Soon afterward, Andy Grove stood up at the   trade show, in Las Vegas, holding a copy of “The Innovator’s Dilemma,” and told the audience that it was the most important book he’d read in ten years. The most important book Andy Grove had read in ten years! A man from  Forbes was in the audience that day, and in 1999 Grove and Christensen appeared together on the cover of  Forbes, and things were never the same for Clayton Christensen again.</p><p>  首席执行官克里斯·安迪·格罗夫（Andy Grove）是最早了解克里斯坦森想法意义的首席执行官。英特尔格鲁夫甚至在克里斯滕森（Christensen）在1997年发表《创新者的困境》之前就听说过这一消息。格鲁夫已经感觉到某种事情正在其行业的底层徘徊，他知道这对他构成了威胁，但他没有语言来向自己精确地解释它，或与他的人民交流为什么他们应该担心它。他让克里斯滕森（Christensen）来到英特尔，克里斯滕森（Christensen）向他介绍了综合工厂和小型工厂，格罗夫（Grove）立刻知道这是他一直在寻找的故事。他让克里斯滕森（Christensen）向他的员工讲了同样的故事，“钢筋”成了公司的口头禅。英特尔推出了赛扬（Celeron）芯片，这是一款廉价产品，非常适合新型低端PC，并在一年之内占领了市场的35％。此后不久，安迪·格罗夫（Andy Grove）站在拉斯维加斯的贸易展览会上，拿着《创新者的困境》的副本，并告诉听众这是他十年来最重要的书。安迪·格罗夫（Andy Grove）十年来读过最重要的书！那天有一位来自《福布斯》的人在场，1999年，格罗夫和克里斯滕森一起出现在《福布斯》的封面上，克莱顿·克里斯滕森的情况再也不一样了。</p><p> His timing was perfect: it was the turn of the millennium, dot-com businesses were springing up all over the place, Digital Equipment Corporation, a giant of the computer age, was disintegrating, and AOL was suddenly and inexplicably worth as much as Time Warner. Obviously, everybody had to be on guard, but against what? Into this chaos and uncertainty came Christensen, telling his story about the steel industry. Not only was the story convincing; it was also what anxious executives wanted to hear. After years of being told that smart managers succeeded and stupid managers failed, here was someone saying that smart people could fail  because they were smart, because they did everything they were supposed to do. This was not only comforting; it also made the theory sound more counterintuitive than it really was. In the end, after all, it was saying what every management theory said: managers failed because they did something wrong.</p><p> 他的时机非常完美：这是千禧年之交，互联网业务如雨后春笋般冒出，计算机时代的巨人数字设备公司（Digital Equipment Corporation）瓦解，而美国在线（AOL）突然价值莫及时间华纳显然，每个人都必须保持警惕，但是要反对什么呢？克里斯滕森（Christensen）讲述了他有关钢铁行业的故事，这给混乱和不确定带来了麻烦。这个故事不仅令人信服，而且令人信服。这也是焦虑的高管想要听到的。在多年被告知聪明的经理成功和愚蠢的经理失败之后，有人说聪明的人可能会失败，因为他们很聪明，因为他们做了他们应该做的一切。这不仅令人安慰；这也使该理论听起来比实际更违反直觉。归根结底，这是所有管理理论都在说的：管理者失败是因为他们做错了什么。</p><p> The other thing about Christensen was that his book wasn’t just for geeky staffers in strategic-planning groups. He was a master storyteller, and C.E.O.s learned through stories, they remembered stories, and they repeated stories to the people who worked for them. Within a year or two, Christensen’s theory of disruption was ubiquitous. Steve Jobs told people that he had been deeply influenced by Christensen’s book. Michael Bloomberg sent copies of it to fifty of his friends. Bill Gates complained that Christensen’s theory had become a required slide in every funding presentation, but he also invited Christensen to his house. The book sold half a million copies and kept on selling.</p><p> 克里斯滕森（Christensen）的另一件事是，他的书不仅是为战略规划小组中令人讨厌的工作人员准备的。他是一位讲故事的高级讲师，首席执行官通过故事中学到了东西，他们记住了故事，并向为他们工作的人们重复了故事。一两年之内，克里斯滕森的颠覆理论无处不在。史蒂夫·乔布斯告诉人们，他深受克里斯滕森的书的影响。迈克尔·彭博（Michael Bloomberg）将其副本发送给了他的五十个朋友。比尔·盖茨（Bill Gates）抱怨克里斯滕森（Christensen）的理论已成为每笔筹资演讲中必不可少的幻灯片，但他还邀请克里斯滕森（Christensen）到他家中去。这本书售出了50万本，并继续销售。</p><p> “Everybody talks about disruption now,” George Gilder, a technology writer and onetime business partner of Christensen’s, says. “Clayton inserted that word in the mind of every C.E.O. in technology. Everywhere you go, people explain that they’re disrupting this or disrupting that. Every big company now tries to disrupt itself all the time, and it’s not clear to me that it’s always a good thing—companies that have a good business may prematurely disinvest from it because they see this inexorable process that Clayton describes.”</p><p> Christensen的技术作家兼业务合作伙伴George Gilder说：“现在所有人都在谈论破坏。” “克莱顿在每个首席执行官的脑海中都插入了这个词。在技​​术上。人们无所不在，向人们解释说他们正在破坏或破坏它。现在，每家大公司都试图无时无刻不在破坏自己，对我来说，这始终是一件好事，因为经营良好的公司可能会过早地从投资中撤资，因为他们看到了克莱顿（Clayton）描述的这一不可逾越的过程。</p><p> “His ideas are pervasive,” Paul Steinberg, the chief technology officer of Motorola Solutions, says. “It doesn’t matter what industry, it’s almost like a universal law. I’ve had ideas of my own squished for just the reason he said they would be, so now that I’m in a higher position I realize there has to be a way of incubating those ideas or the company will perish. He scared the crap out of me.”</p><p>“他的想法无处不在，”摩托罗拉解决方案首席技术官Paul Steinberg说。 “什么行业都没关系，几乎就像是一部普遍法。我只是出于他说的理由而提出自己的想法，因此，现在我处于更高的位置，我意识到必须有一种孵化这些想法的方法，否则公司将会灭亡。他吓坏了我。”</p><p>  Christensen is a Mormon. There have been Mormons in his family on both sides for four generations, which is to say very nearly since the founding of the church. His great-grandfather on his father’s mother’s side, Hans Magleby, was a carpenter in a small town in Denmark who was converted by one of the earliest groups of Mormon missionaries to Europe, in the eighteen-fifties. He travelled to America and took a train to Iowa, which was as far as the railroad went. He couldn’t afford a covered wagon, so he made a handcart for his belongings and pulled it on foot a thousand miles to Salt Lake City. Utah had been incorporated as a U.S. territory only in 1850; when the first Mormons settled there, they were fleeing persecution in the United States, and the land was still part of Mexico. Most of the region was so dry as to be nearly uninhabitable, but Brigham Young sent new immigrants to farm the desert, and Magleby was sent to Richfield, a tiny outpost a hundred and sixty miles south of Salt Lake.</p><p>  克里斯滕森是摩门教徒。双方的家人中已有摩门教徒四代了，也就是说，自教会成立以来，这已经差不多了。他的父亲曾祖父汉斯·马格比（Hans Magleby）是丹麦一个小镇的木匠，他是摩门教最早的一群人在18世纪50年代改信欧洲。他去了美国，乘火车去了爱荷华州，那是铁路的最大距离。他买不起带顶棚的货车，于是他手推车买了东西，然后步行将其拉到盐湖城一千英里。犹他州直到1850年才被并入美国领土。当第一批摩门教徒定居在那里时，他们正逃离美国的迫害，而这片土地仍然是墨西哥的一部分。该地区大部分地区都非常干燥，几乎无法居住，但杨百翰（Brigham Young）派遣新移民来耕种沙漠，马格比（Magleby）被派往里奇菲尔德（Richfield），那里是盐湖以南一百六十英里处的一个小哨所。</p><p> Christensen’s mother’s family emigrated from Germany and went to live on the prairie in Alberta, Canada, where Mormons had also settled in the nineteenth century. His mother, Verda Mae Fuller, attended Brigham Young University, in Salt Lake City. She graduated at nineteen and went to work as a scriptwriter for radio, and when television came to Utah, just after the war, she wrote and anchored a news show for farmers. She met Christensen’s father, Robert, at a church function. He worked at a grocery store, stocking shelves. They married and settled in an area called Rose Park. Their house was a small brick bungalow, like most houses in the neighborhood—they were starter homes for returning G.I.s, built right after the war. The women in Rose Park mostly stayed home; the men were mailmen, or plumbers, or worked at the oil refineries north of Salt Lake, or at Kennecott, the copper mill out in Magna.</p><p> 克里斯滕森（Christensen）的母亲一家从德国移民，然后住在加拿大艾伯塔省的草原上，摩门教徒也在19世纪在那里定居。他的母亲Verda Mae Fuller就读于盐湖城的杨百翰大学。她19岁毕业，去广播电台当编剧，战争爆发后，当电视来到犹他州时，她为农民撰写并主持了一个新闻节目。她在教堂举行的宴会上遇见了克里斯滕森的父亲罗伯特。他在一家杂货店工作，备有货架。他们结婚并定居在玫瑰园地区。他们的房子是一座小砖砌平房，就像附近的大多数房屋一样，它们是战后刚建完的G.I.s归还者的起步房。玫瑰园的妇女大多呆在家里。这些人是邮递员，水管工，或者是在盐湖北部的炼油厂工作，或者是在麦格纳市的铜厂肯尼科特工作。</p><p> When they had their first child, Verda Mae quit working for money, but she stayed up all night writing scripts for church productions or articles for church programs, and took care of the kids durin</p><p> 当他们生第一个孩子时，Verda Mae放弃了赚钱的工作，但她整夜都熬不着为教堂制作剧本或为教堂节目写文章，并照顾了都灵的孩子。</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/05/14/when-giants-fail">https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/05/14/when-giants-fail</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/巨人/">#巨人</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/giants/">#giants</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
