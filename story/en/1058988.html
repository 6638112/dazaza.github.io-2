It was fun to compare where we were in our careers. I had fifteen years of experience designing for web clients, she had one year, and yet some how, we were in the same situation: we enjoyed the work, but were utterly confused and overwhelmed by the rapidly increasing complexity of it all. What the hell happened? (That’s a rhetorical question, of course.)</p><p>   在过去的夏天，我在网络会议上进行了演讲，后来进入了一个年轻的数字设计学生迷人的对话。比较我们在职业生涯的地方很有趣。我有十五年的网络客户设计，她有一年，但有些人在同样的情况下，我们享受了这项工作，但完全困惑，而且被一切迅速增加了复杂性。到底发生了什么？ （当然，这是一个修辞问题。）</p><p> It was a relief for both of us to mutually confess our frustration and confusion, and I began to wonder if this situation was something to laugh off or take seriously. Neither of us had an answer, but a bit of time and distance has shown me that we must do both. I’d like to extend that conversation today and attempt to capture my perspective on that confusion and what it costs us.</p><p> 我们对我们俩相互承认我们的沮丧和混乱是一个缓解，我开始怀疑这种情况是否有笑或认真对待。我们俩都没有答案，但有点时间和距离向我展示了我们必须做两者。我想今天延长那个谈话，并试图抓住我对这种混乱的看法以及它的成本。</p><p>  Absence was the primary source of my confusion. Three years ago, I stopped making websites for clients to focus on  Abstract, a software company I co-founded. My work there finished at the beginning of last year, and after a little time off, I decided to reopen the design studio I was running beforehand.</p><p>  缺席是我困惑的主要来源。三年前，我停止制作网站为客户专注于抽象，这是一个我共同创立的软件公司。我的工作在去年年初完成，经过一点时间，我决定重新打开我事先运行的设计工作室。</p><p> And wouldn’t you know it? The first few jobs through the door were websites. A lot can change in three years, so I decided to brush up on the latest developments in how to best make websites… and oh my…</p><p> 你不知道吗？首先通过门的工作是网站。三年来，很多可以改变，所以我决定刷新如何最好地制作网站的最新发展......而且哦，我......</p><p>   The complexity was off-putting at first. I was unsure if I even wanted tackle a website after seeing the current working methods. Eventually, I agreed to the projects. My gut told me that a lot of the new complexities in workflows, toolchains, and development methods are completely optional for many projects. That belief is the second thread of this talk: I’d like to make a modest defense of simple design and implementation as a better option for the web and the people who work there.</p><p>   复杂性首先脱掉了。在看到当前的工作方法后，我是否不确定。最终，我同意这个项目。我的肠道告诉我，许多项目都是全新的工作流，工具链和开发方法中的新复杂性。这种信念是这次谈话的第二个线程：我想对简单的设计和实施做出适度的防御，作为网络的更好选择和在那里工作的人。</p><p> But, I am getting ahead of myself. First, I should tell you a bit more about who I am and where I come from.</p><p> 但是，我领先于自己。首先，我应该告诉你更多关于我是谁，我来自哪里。 </p><p>  I run a boutique design studio, which is a pretentious way of saying that it’s tiny with a capital-T. The studio does all kinds of work: books, magazines, branding, and yes, of course, websites. This year is an anniversary. The studio is celebrating 15 years in business, and I’m personally celebrating 20 years of making websites. As with any big anniversary, you get sentimental about how things started.</p><p>我经营了一个精品设计工作室，这是一种自命不凡的说法，这是一个小写的小写。工作室是各种各样的工作：书籍，杂志，品牌，是的，当然，网站。今年是周年纪念日。工作室正在庆祝商务15年，我个人庆祝20年的制作网站。与任何大周年纪念日一样，您对如何开始的感情。</p><p> The studio began in 2002 as a man (that’s me) with a laptop and a stack of paper at a desk in the corner of his apartment.</p><p> 这款工作室始于2002年，作为一个男人（那是我）用一台笔记本电脑和一堆纸在他公寓的一角的桌子上。</p><p> Fifteen years later, the studio is still a man with a laptop and a stack of paper at a desk in the corner of his apartment.</p><p> 十五年后，工作室仍然是一个带笔记本电脑和一堆纸的人，在他的公寓的角落里。</p><p> It’s difficult to fathom how much has changed around the studio in the last 15 years. Back then, there were no social media as we know of them today—no Facebook, no Instagram, no snaps; most of the sites you visit today did not exist back then, and most of the sites we visited then do not exist now. There were no iPhones. You would go online to fetch directions and print out the map like a neanderthal. We were hitting rocks together trying to make graphic design.</p><p> 难以在过去的15年里，在工作室周围有多少变化。然后，没有社交媒体，我们今天知道它们 - 没有Facebook，没有Instagram，没有捕捉;您今天访问的大多数网站都不存在，然后我们访问的大部分网站现在都不存在。没有iPhone。您将在线上网来获取方向并打印出尼安德特人的地图。我们正在击中岩石，试图制作图形设计。</p><p>  At first I was bummed about my studio’s lack of visible progress, but then it hit me: what if I nailed it? Why change if it’s working? I’ve been able to approach a lot of different projects from many different angles, and I’m happy to report that I’ve gotten pretty good at a lot of it! Time and practice really do help.</p><p>  起初，我讨厌我的工作室缺乏明显的进步，但是它击中了我：如果我钉了呢？为什么改变它是否有效？我能够从许多不同角度接近许多不同的项目，我很高兴地报告我已经很好地讨论了很多！时间和实践真的有助于帮助。</p><p> Except with the websites. They separate themselves from the others, because I don’t feel much better at making them after 20 years. My knowledge and skills develop a bit, then things change, and half of what I know becomes dead weight. This hardly happens with any of the other work I do.</p><p> 除了网站。他们将自己与其他人分开，因为我在20年后做得更好。我的知识和技能发展了一点，然后事情发生了变化，我所知道的一半成为枯萎。这几乎没有发生在我做的任何其他工作中。</p><p> I wonder if I have twenty years of experience making websites, or if it is really five years of experience, repeated four times. If you’ve been working in the technology industry a while, please tell me this sounds familiar to you.</p><p> 我想知道我是否有二十年的经验制作网站，或者如果它真的是五年的经验，重复四次。如果您一直在技术行业工作，请告诉我对您熟悉的声音。 </p><p>    As I said, I made my first website 20 years ago. I know this because I was a teenager doing the Lord’s work: transcribing the lyrics to Radiohead’s  OK Computer. It was 1997, I was learning HTML, and there was one problem with the design that was confusing me: how do I put two things next to each other?</p><p>正如我所说，我在20年前发了我的第一个网站。我知道这是因为我是一个少年做主的工作：将歌词转录到罗克波波的好电脑。这是1997年，我正在学习HTML，并且设计的设计有一个问题让我困惑：我如何把两件事彼此放在彼此之上？</p><p> Twenty years later, we’re still working out the answer to that very basic question.</p><p> 二十年后，我们仍然营造出这一基本问题的答案。</p><p>  Back in 1997, we used tables and spacer gifs. It was like designing a website in a spreadsheet from hell. I found this process fun for some reason. Perhaps I was fascinated by the potential of bashing together something in my room, hitting a button, then having it be “out there.”</p><p>  回到1997年，我们使用了桌子和垫片GIF。这就像在地狱的电子表格中设计一个网站。出于某种原因，我发现这个过程有趣。也许我对房间里的一些东西的潜力感到着迷，击中一个按钮，然后在那里“出来”。</p><p>  About five years later, websites moved to using floats in CSS because tables were not semantic. Fair enough! Since then, I’ve spent about 200 hours reading about how to get floats to clear. I’m still not sure I understand it; I type  clear: both and say a prayer to the box model.</p><p>  大约五年后，网站移动到CSS中的Floats，因为表不是语义。很公平！从那以后，我花了大约200小时阅读如何让浮动清除。我仍然不确定我理解;我键入清晰：两者都对盒式型号祷告。</p><p>  I was saved by Flexbox after five years of guess work. It is my baby. I was trained as a print designer, and with flexbox, I can type 3 or 4 lines of CSS, and have two blocks of text line up at the baseline. Hallelujah. I only needed to wait a decade to get this.</p><p>  五年的猜测工作后，我被Flexbox保存了。这是我的宝贝。我被培训为打印设计师，并使用Flexbox，我可以在基线上键入3或4行的CSS，并在基线中有两个文本块。 Hallelujah。我只需要等待十年来实现这一点。</p><p>  And now, after flexing with flexbox, along comes CSS Grid: a powerful new feature that promises to make responsive web design even more confusing. Of course, I am joking about this, because Grid is a big improvement in controlling layout on the web. But it is a bit spooky to sit down and learn more about it, because every time I see a diagram explaining how CSS Grid works…</p><p>  现在，使用Flexbox弯曲后，CSS网格：一个强大的新功能，承诺使响应式网页设计更加令人困惑。当然，我正在开玩笑，因为网格是控制网上的布局的大改进。但是坐下来了解更多信息，有点怪异，因为每次我看到一个图表解释了CSS网格如何工作的图......</p><p>  I’m reminded of the table layouts I was doing in 1997. I know Grid and Table layouts are fundamentally different in their capabilities and approach, but that doesn’t stop me from being unreasonable and irrational about their surface similarities. My lizard brain gets talking, and it says we’re stuck in a loop and it’s repeating. We’ve completed a lap on a cycle which will go around forever. Another approach for layout will come along five years from now. It will probably resemble floats and not knowing how to clear a float will bite me in the ass for the second time in my career.</p><p>  我提醒我在1997年做的表格布局。我知道网格和表格布局在他们的能力和方法方面具有根本不同，但这并不会阻止我对其表面相似性的不合理和不合理。我的蜥蜴大脑得到了谈论，它说我们陷入了循环，它是重复的。我们在一个周围完成了一圈，这将永远解决。从现在起五年来的另一种布局的方法将是五年。它可能类似于浮动，而不知道如何清除如何在我的职业生涯中第二次咬我的屁股。 </p><p>  There are similar examples of the cycle in other parts of how websites get designed and made. Nothing stays settled, so of course a person with one year of experience and one with fifteen years of experience can both be confused. Things are so often only understood by those who are well-positioned in the middle of the current wave of thought. If you’re before the sweet spot in the wave, your inexperience means you know nothing. If you are after, you will know lots of things that aren’t applicable to that particular way of doing things. I don’t bring this up to imply that the young are dumb or that the inexperienced are inept—of course they’re not. But remember: if you stick around in the industry long enough, you’ll get to feel all three situations.</p><p>在网站如何设计和制造的其他部分中存在类似的循环示例。没有什么能保持解决，所以当然一​​个有一年经验的人和十五年经验的人都可以混淆。事情经常只能理解那些在目前思想中的中间良好的人。如果你在浪潮中的甜蜜点之前，你的缺乏意味着你什么都不知道。如果您在之后，您将了解许多不适用于这种特定方式的事情。我没有把它提升到暗示年轻人愚蠢或缺乏经验的是无能为力的 - 当然他们不是。但请记住：如果您在行业中粘在一起，您会感受到所有三种情况。</p><p> One argument says that continual change in methodology is rigorous and healthy. I agree. Keeping things in play helps us to more easily fix what’s wrong. It’d be terrible if nothing could ever change. But I also agree with the other argument: people only have so much patience. How many laps around the cycle can a person run? I’m on lap five now, and I can tell you that it is exhausting to engage with rehashed ideas from the past without feeling a tiny amount of prejudice against them.</p><p> 一项争论称，方法论的持续变化是严格的健康。我同意。保持戏剧中的东西有助于我们更轻松地解决问题。如果没有任何改变，那就太可怕了。但我也同意其他论点：人们只有这么多的耐心。一个人可以跑多少圈？我现在在第五圈，我可以告诉你，从过去的rehashed想法与rehashed想法进行疲惫，而不会感到微小的偏见。</p><p> Methods that were once taboo are back on the table. For instance, last week I was reading a post about the benefits of not using stylesheets and instead having inline styles for everything. The post made a few compelling points, but this approach would have been crazy talk a few years ago.</p><p> 一旦禁忌的方法就会回到桌面上。例如，上周我正在阅读有关不使用样式表的好处的帖子，而是为所有内容提供内联样式。帖子发出了一些令人信服的积分，但几年前这种方法将疯狂谈话。</p><p> So much of how we build websites and software comes down to how we think. The churn of tools, methods, and abstractions also signify the replacement of ideology. A person must usually think in a way similar to the people who created the tools to successfully use them. It’s not as simple as putting down a screwdriver and picking up a wrench. A person needs to revise their whole frame of thinking; they must change their mind.</p><p> 我们如何构建网站和软件的许多人都会介绍我们的想法。工具，方法和抽象的流失也表示替代意识形态。一个人通常必须以类似于创建工具成功使用它们的人的方式思考。它并不像放下螺丝刀并拿起扳手一样简单。一个人需要修改他们整个思维框架;他们必须改变主意。</p><p> In one way, it is easier to be inexperienced: you don’t have to learn what is no longer relevant. Experience, on the other hand, creates two distinct struggles: the first is to identify and unlearn what is no longer necessary (that’s work, too). The second is to remain open-minded, patient, and willing to engage with what’s new, even if it resembles a new take on something you decided against a long time ago.</p><p> 在一种方式，更容易缺乏经验：您不必学会什么不再相关。另一方面，经验创造了两个不同的斗争：第一个是识别和解开不再需要的东西（也是工作也是如此）。第二个是保持开放，病人，愿意与新的东西搞，即使它类似于你很久以前的事情。</p><p>  That spirit of willingness was in me when I was investigating everything that had changed in the last 3 years. I started with the best of intentions, but the more I learned, the grumpier I got. It seemed that most of the new methods involved setting up elaborate systems to automate parts of the work. This is fine for particularly complicated and large projects, but setting up the system and maintaining it seemed to be more effort for an experienced person on a small project than doing the work without it.</p><p>  当我调查过去3年的所有改变时，我的意愿精神就在我身边。我从最大的意图开始，但我学到的越多，我所拥有的脾气暴躁。似乎大多数涉及建立精心制定的系统以自动化工作的新方法。这对于特别复杂和大的项目来说很好，但建立系统并保持似乎对一个有经验的人在一个小项目上的努力而不是没有它的工作。</p><p> The new methods were invented to manage a level of complexity that is completely foreign to me and my work. It was easy to back away from most of this new stuff when I realized I have alternate ways of managing complexity. Instead of changing my tools or workflow, I change my design. It’s like designing a house so it’s easy to build, instead of setting up cranes typically used for skyscrapers.</p><p> 发明了新方法，以管理对我和我的工作完全陌生的复杂程度。当我意识到我有替代的方式管理复杂性时，很容易远离大部分新的东西。我改变了我的设计而不是改变我的工具或工作流程。这就像设计房子，所以它很容易构建，而不是建立通常用于摩天大楼的起重机。 </p><p>  Directness is best in my experience, so a great photo, memorable illustration, or pitch-perfect sentence does most of the work. Beyond that, fancy implementation has never moved the needle much for my clients.</p><p>Directness在我的经验中最好，因此大部分工作都是一张很棒的照片，难忘的插图或俯仰完美的判决。除此之外，花哨的实施从未为我的客户移动过针。</p><p> My web design philosophy is no razzle-dazzle. My job is to help my clients identify and express the one or two uniquely true things about their project or company, then enhance it through a memorable design with a light touch. If complexity comes along, we focus in on it, look for patterns, and change the blueprint for what we’re building. We don’t necessarily go looking for better tools or fancier processes. In the past, I’ve called this following the  grain of the web, which is to use design choices that swing with what HTML, CSS, and screens make easy, flexible, and resilient.</p><p> 我的网络设计哲学不是令人睁大眼睛。我的工作是帮助我的客户识别和表达关于他们的项目或公司的一个或两个独特的真实事物，然后通过令人轻触的令人难忘的设计来增强它。如果复杂性出现，我们专注于它，寻找模式，并改变我们建造的内容的蓝图。我们不一定要寻找更好的工具或猛虎师进程。在过去，我在Web的谷物之后打电话给这个，这是使用与HTML，CSS和屏幕一起摆动的设计选择，这使得简单，灵活，有弹性。</p><p> It seems there are fewer and fewer notable websites built with this approach each year. So, I thought it would be useful to remind everyone that the easiest and cheapest strategy for dealing with complexity is not to invent something to manage it, but to avoid the complexity altogether with a more clever plan.</p><p> 似乎每年在这种方法内建立的较少和更少的标记网站。所以，我认为提醒每个人将是有用的，即处理复杂性的最简单和最便宜的策略不是要发明东西来管理它，而是避免使用更聪明的计划完全复杂。</p><p> To test how much complexity comes along with my limited needs, I wrote down the technical requirements of my web design practice. It’s not a long list:</p><p> 为了测试我的网络设计练习的技术要求，凭借我的有限需求来测试多种复杂性。这不是一个很长的名单：</p><p>  All of these have been more than met for at least five years, but the complexity of even these very fundamental needs has ballooned in the last few years.</p><p>  所有这些都比满足至少五年，但即使是这些非常基本需求的复杂性也在过去几年中崩溃了。</p><p> For instance, I just showed you four different methods to put two things next to each other. Each new method mostly replaces the last, so hopefully we’re reaching a stabilization point with flexbox and CSS Grid. But who knows what will come out five years from now?</p><p> 例如，我刚向您展示了四种不同的方法，以将两件事彼此放在彼此相邻。每种新方法大多都替换了最后一个，所以希望我们使用Flexbox和CSS网格达到稳定点。但谁知道从现在开始五年后会出现什么？</p><p>  Webfonts? I thought we could jot down a few lines with  @font-face, but  A Book Apart just published a 90 page e-book on how to load those fonts. This is totally surprising to me: I thought implementing webfonts was a relatively easy procedure, but I guess not!</p><p>  Webfonts？我以为我们可以用@ font-face缩小几行，但是一本书刚刚发布了一个90页的电子书如何加载这些字体。这对我来说是完全令人惊讶的：我以为实现Webfonts是一个相对容易的程序，但我猜不！ </p><p>  Even images are now complicated. Vector images get served as SVGs, but digging deep into this can make you go cross-eyed, because an SVG is essentially another web page to embed in your webpage. And with raster, the need to send along the best-sized image for the right device is complicated enough that  paid services have come along to manage this for you. Serving an image is now as complicated as serving a video.</p><p>甚至图像现在都很复杂。传染媒介图像被送达为SVG，但深入挖掘它可以让您跨眼睛，因为SVG本质上是另一个网页嵌入您的网页。通过光栅，需要沿着右侧设备的最佳图像发送的需要复杂，即付费服务已经为您提供管理。服务图像现在与服务中的服务一样复杂。</p><p>  My point is that the foundations are now sufficiently complicated enough on their own that it seems foolish to go add more optional complexity on top of it. I’ve kept my examples to the most basic of web implementations, and I haven’t touched on Javascript, animation, libraries, frameworks, pre-processors, package managers, automation, testing, or deployment. Whew.</p><p>  我的观点是，基础上现在足够复杂，他们似乎愚蠢地在其上添加了更可选的复杂性。我将我的例子保存到最基本的Web实现中，我没有触摸JavaScript，动画，库，框架，预处理器，包管理器，自动化，测试或部署。哇。</p><p>  All of that bundled together is the popular way to work in 2018. But other people’s toolchains are absolutely inscrutable from the outside. Even getting started is touchy. Last month, I had to install a package manager to install a package manager. That’s when I closed my laptop and slowly backed away from it. We’re a long way from the CSS Zen Garden where I started.</p><p>  所有这些都捆绑在一起是2018年的流行方式。但其他人的工具安全是从外面拒绝的。即使入门也很敏感。上个月，我必须安装一个包管理器来安装包管理器。那是我关闭笔记本电脑并慢慢退缩的时候。我们已经开始的CSS Zen Garden很长的路。</p><p> If you go talk to a senior software developer, you’ll probably hear them complain about spaghetti code. This is when code is overwrought, unorganized, opaque, and snarled with dependencies. I perked up when I heard the term used for the first time, because, while I can’t identify spaghetti code as a designer, I sure as hell know about spaghetti workflows and spaghetti toolchains. It feels like we’re there now on the web.</p><p> 如果您与高级软件开发人员交谈，您可能会听到他们抱怨意大利面条代码。这是代码被重写，无组织，不透明，并咆哮着依赖性。当我听到第一次使用的术语时，我充斥着，因为我无法将意大利面代码作为设计师识别，我确定是关于意大利面条工作流程和意大利面条的工具链。它感觉就像我们现在在网上。</p><p>  That breaks my heart, because so much of my start on the web came from being able to see and easily make sense of any site I’d visit. I had view source, but each year that goes by, it becomes less and less helpful as a way to investigate other people’s work. Markup balloons in size and becomes illegible because computers are generating it without an eye for context. Styles become overly verbose and redundant to the point of confusion. Functionality gets obfuscated behind compressed Javascript.</p><p>  这突破了我的心脏，因为我在网络上的大部分开始都是能够看到和轻松地了解我访问的任何网站。我有看法来源，但每年都在，它变得越来越少有助于调查其他人的工作。标记气球的大小并变得难以辨认，因为计算机在没有注意上下文的情况下生成它。风格变得过于冗长，冗余到混乱点。功能会对压缩的JavaScript后面遇到困扰。</p><p> This situation is annoying to me, because my thoughts turn to that young designer I mentioned at the start of my talk. How many opportunities did I have to reproduce what I saw by having legible examples in front of me? And how detrimental is it to have that kind of information obfuscated for her? Before, the websites could explain themselves; now, someone needs to walk you through it.</p><p> 这种情况对我来说很烦人，因为我的想法转向那个我在谈话开始时提到的年轻设计师。我有多少机会通过在我面前有清晰的例子来重现我所看到的？这是对她有什么会对的信息有多么有害？之前，网站可以解释自己;现在，有人需要走过它。</p><p> Illegibility comes from complexity without clarity. I believe that the legibility of the source is one of the most important properties of the web. It’s the main thing that keeps the door open to independent, unmediated contributions to the network. If you can write markup, you don’t need Medium or Twitter or Instagram (though they’re nice to have). And the best way to help someone  write markup is to make sure they can  read markup.</p><p> 不清晰的情况，难以犯的是复杂性。我相信源的易读性是网络最重要的属性之一。这是将门打开对网络的独立，无线贡献的主要件。如果您可以编写标记，则不需要中等或推特或Instagram（尽管它们很好）。以及帮助某人写标记的最佳方法是确保他们可以读取标记。 </p><p> I wonder what young designers think of this situation and how they are educating themselves in a complicated field. How do they learn if the code is illegible? Does it seem like more experienced people are pulling up the ladder of opportunity by doing this? Twenty years ago, I decided to make my own website, because I saw an example of HTML and I could read it. Many of my design peers are the same. We possess skills to make websites, but we stopped there. We stuck with markup and never progressed into full-on programming, because we were only willing to go as far as things were legible.</p><p>我想知道年轻的设计师想到这种情况以及如何在复杂的领域教育自己。如果代码是难以辨认的，他们如何学习？这似乎更有经验的人通过这样做的是机会拉起的阶梯吗？二十年前，我决定制作自己的网站，因为我看到了一个HTML的例子，我可以读它。我的许多设计同伴都是一样的。我们拥有制作网站的技能，但我们停止了那里。我们陷入了标记，从未进入全面编程，因为我们愿意尽可能地走得更清楚。</p><p> If knowledge about the web deteriorates quickly, it’s worthwhile to develop a solid personal philosophy toward change and learning.</p><p> 如果关于网络的知识快速恶化，那么为改变和学习发展稳固的个人哲学，这是值得的。</p><p> Silicon Valley has tried to provide a few of these. All are about speed. The most famous comes from Facebook, with their “Move fast and break things” mantra. This phrase has been thrown under the bus enough times by now, but it is interesting that so few are willing to commit to its opposite: “Go slow and fix things.”</p><p> 硅谷试图提供其中的一些。一切都是关于速度。最着名的来自Facebook，他们的“快速和休息”口头禅。这句话现在已经在公交车下抛出了足够的时间，但很有趣，很少有人愿意承诺它的对面：“走缓慢并解决。”</p><p>   This has been my favorite internet discovery of the last few months. I’ve watched it enough times to overthink it. See, the rabbit doesn’t lose because he gets tired. He loses because he gets confused about which direction to go. Did you notice how it stops in the middle and stares blankly as everyone around it yells loudly about things it doesn’t understand? That’s me on Twitter.</p><p>   这是我最喜欢过去几个月的互联网发现。我已经看过足够的时间来占据它。看，兔子不会失去因为他累了。他失去了因为他对去哪个方向感到困惑。你有没有注意到它是如何在中间停止的，因为它周围的每个人都大声大声地盯着它对它不明白的事情？那是我在推特上。</p><p> As someone who has decades of experience on the web, I hate to compare myself to the tortoise, but hey, if it fits, it fits. Let’s be more like that tortoise: diligent, direct, and purposeful. The web needs pockets of slowness and thoughtfulness as its reach and power continues to increase. What we depend upon must be properly built and intelligently formed. We need to create space for complexity’s important sibling: nuance. Spaces without nuance tend to gravitate towards stupidity. And as an American, I can tell you, there are no limits to the amount of damage that can be inflicted by that dangerous cocktail of fast-moving-stupid.</p><p> 作为有几十年的网络经验的人，我讨厌将自己与乌龟进行比较，但嘿，如果它适合，它适合。让我们更喜欢那只乌龟：勤奋，直接和有目的。由于其覆盖范围和力量持续增加，网络需要缓慢和思想的口袋。我们所依赖的必须正确构建和智能地形成。我们需要为复杂性的重要兄弟姐妹创造空间：差别。没有细微的空间倾向于倾向于愚蠢。作为美国人，我可以告诉你，可以通过这种危险的快速愚蠢的危险鸡尾酒来造成的损坏量没有限制。</p><p> The web also needs diligent people so that the idea of what the web is and what it does remains legible to everyone. This applies to being able to read the systems and social environments the web creates so we know what’s real and what’s not, but the call for legibility should also humbly apply to writing legible code and designs systems that are easy for nearly anyone to interpret thanks to their elegance.
