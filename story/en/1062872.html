Nearly everything being built is boring, joyless, and/or ugly, even though there is no reason it has to be. The architectural profession rewards work that is pretentious and bland. The cities we build are not wondrous.</p><p>建筑的东西非常错误。几乎所有建造的东西都是无聊，快乐和/或丑陋的，即使没有理由也是如此。建筑职业奖励工作是自命不凡的和平淡。我们建造的城市并不奇怪。</p><p> I’ve documented it  at length before, but the problem can be seen at a glance.</p><p> 我以前记录了它的长度，但问题可以一目了然地看到。</p><p>      Here is the lobby of the Guardian Building in Detroit,  with mosaic patterns designed by the innovative ceramic artist  Mary Chase Perry:</p><p>      这是底特律守护建筑的大堂，由创新的陶瓷艺术家玛丽追逐佩里设计的马赛克图案：</p><p>      Here are a couple of works by the greatest architect who ever lived, Antoni Gaudí, whose work should have (but did not) become the jumping-off point for architecture’s continued development:</p><p>      以下是曾经生活过的最伟大的建筑师的作品，antonigaudí，其工作应该有（但没有）成为建筑持续发展的跳跃点：</p><p>      Now let us examine works by some of the recent winners of the  Pritzker Prize, the highest award in architecture. The prize-winners are, theoretically, the  greatest architects of our time, producing the most celebrated work of the era. These works are thus the best humanity has to offer at the moment.</p><p>      现在让我们在普拉茨克奖的一些获奖者中审视工作，这是架构最高的奖项。理论上，获奖者是我们这个时代最伟大的建筑师，产生了最着名的时代的工作。因此，这些作品是目前最好的人性。</p><p>         Enough. You get the picture. Now I’d like you to think of the words that come to your mind when you see these buildings, and the qualities they possess that stick out to you. I would describe them as:</p><p>         足够的。你得到了照片。现在我希望你能想到当你看到这些建筑物的时候来到你的脑海，以及他们拥有的品质伸出来。我会描述它们：</p><p>  But that is not what the architectural community thinks. That last picture, Alejandro Aravena’s Angelini Innovation Center, was called by the Pritzker jury “remarkably humane and inviting.” His work is “welcoming,” they say, and “deepens our understanding of what is truly great design.” When I read things like this, I feel like I must be of a different species to these jury members, because I literally cannot see how that structure could be described as humane or welcoming. Words seem to mean different things to me and to them.</p><p>  但这不是建筑社区的想法。最后一张图片Alejandro Aravena的Angelini Innovation Center被Pritzker陪审团称为“非常人性化和邀请”。他们的工作是“欢迎”，他们说，“深化我们对真正设计的理解”。当我读这样的东西时，我觉得我必须对这些陪审团成员有不同的物种，因为我实际上看不到这种结构可以被描述为人性化或欢迎。言语似乎对我和他们意味着不同的东西。 </p><p> Perhaps it is that architects speak in a special language, and what looks to  me like an arbitrary and ugly assortment of random stark rectangles is, to them, a kind of Morse code saying “Hello! Come inside! Happy to have you here.” But if that  is the case, it doesn’t redeem the buildings for architects to have designed them using a special insider code that makes their beauty only visible to other architects.</p><p>也许是建筑师用一种特殊的语言发言，看起来像一个随机和丑陋的各种随机刺痛的矩形看起来是，对他们来说，一种莫尔斯代码说“你好！请你进来！很高兴有你在这里。“但如果是这种情况，它不会兑换建筑师的建筑物，以使用特殊的内部内部代码设计它们，这些代码仅使他们的美丽仅对其他建筑师可见。</p><p> Beauty. What is beauty? Beauty is that which gives aesthetic pleasure. Beauty is both subjective and objective—subjective because it is “in the eye of the beholder” but  objective in that “pleasure” is something you either experience or you do not. If a building isn’t giving people pleasure to look at, then it is not beautiful, because beautiful things are things that you want to keep looking at because seeing them brings joy.</p><p> 美丽。什么是美丽？美丽是令人审美的乐趣。美是主观和客观的主观性，因为它是“在旁观者的眼中”，但客观就是“快乐”是你的经历或你没有的东西。如果建筑物没有让人愉快地看，那么它并不美丽，因为美丽的东西是你想继续看的东西，因为看到他们带来了快乐。</p><p> The fact that beauty is both subjective and objective means that a thing can be beautiful to some people and not to others. I think it is fair to say that Pritzker Prize-winning buildings are  beautiful to architects, who clearly receive pleasure from looking at them. They are just not beautiful to me. I suspect they are not to the majority of people, either, or at least I suspect that the majority of people get (objectively) more pleasure out of looking at the ancient buildings of the first half of my presentation than the contemporary buildings in the second half. I believe definitive proof of this is that tourists come from all over the world to just to  look at Hindu temples, Japanese gardens, the French Quarter, Venice, and Gaudi’s buildings in Barcelona. People literally plan entire trips, carrying themselves across the world, just so they can be  near these buildings and drink them in up close. I cannot imagine anyone who is not an architect visiting the Pritzker Prize buildings.</p><p> 美丽是主观和目标的事实意味着某事可以对一些人来说是美丽的，而不是别人。我认为这是公平的，说Pritzker获奖的建筑物对建筑师来说是美丽的，他明确地看到了乐趣。他们对我来说并不美丽。我怀疑他们不是大多数人，要么是我怀疑，大多数人都会得到（客观地）更多的乐趣看着我的演示文稿的上半年的古老建筑而不是第二座一半。我相信这是明确证明，游客来自世界各地，只需看看印度寺庙，日本花园，法国区，威尼斯和巴塞罗那的大厦。人们实际上计划整个旅行，携带自己的世界，只是这样他们就可以靠近这些建筑物并喝它们近距离。我无法想象任何人那些不是参观Pritzker奖品的建筑师。</p><p> Why? Is it just because the first buildings are “old?” I do not think it is. Instead, I think that people do not visit the contemporary buildings because they do not give certain  feelings to the viewer, feelings that people enjoy feeling. They do not amaze, enchant, or make the jaw drop. They lack the kind of intricacy that means you can stare at them endlessly and keep finding new things. They feel dead. Architect Christopher Alexander, whose work I cite frequently, would say that they lack  what he calls “the quality without a name,” which he uses to describe a certain kind of quality that places can have that gives us a certain kind of feeling that is difficult to describe but nonetheless real. Alexander argues that our subjective feelings matter, and so “word associations” assessments like the one above do matter. If a place feels cold and off-putting and you don’t want to visit it, well, it’s badly-designed, unless the  purpose is to repel people, in which case it is well-designed but just strangely sociopathic.</p><p> 为什么？是因为第一个建筑物是“老？”我不认为是。相反，我认为人们不参观当代建筑，因为他们不会对观众提供某些感受，人们享受感受的感受。它们不会惊叹，附魔或使下巴下降。他们缺乏这种复杂性意味着你可以无休止地盯着他们并继续寻找新事物。他们感到死了。建筑师Christopher Alexander，我经常引用其工作，会说他们缺乏他所谓的“没有名字的质量”，他用来形容某种品质，这些地方可以让我们带来一种某种感觉难以描述但仍然是真实的。亚历山大争辩说，我们的主观感情，所以“词构协会”评估就像以上物质一样。如果一个地方感觉冷漠，你不想拜访它，那么，除非目的是击退人，否则这是非常糟糕的设计，在这种情况下，它是精心设计的，但只是奇怪的社会道。</p><p> What is missing from the contemporary prize-winners above? My own feeling is that there are a few things that spark feelings of delight in a place that are missing:</p><p> 当代奖品获奖者缺少的是什么？我自己的感受是，在一个缺少的地方有一些引发喜悦的东西：</p><p>  Some of this is objectively true, even if you disagree with me about whether it matters. The Pritzker Prize winners above  are less colorful. They don’t have elaborate handmade mosaics. They don’t have gargoyles. They are more asymmetric. These things are not in dispute. Where it gets more controversial is the squishier feelings-based stuff. Is a place “warm?” Is it “monolithic?” Is it  humane? And of course most contentiously, is it “dead” or “alive” and is it “beautiful?”</p><p>  其中一些是客观的，即使你不同意我是否重要的​​事情。上面的Pritzker奖获奖者不那么多彩。他们没有详细制作手工制作马赛克。他们没有石像乐。它们更不对称。这些事情并非争议。它变得更加争议的地方是基于强大的感受的东西。是一个“温暖？”的地方是“单片？”是人道吗？当然最争议地，它是“死”或“活着”，是“美丽？”</p><p> I think it’s  clearly true, though, that the first set of pictures I posted are of the kinds of places that are no longer built by contemporary architects. There is a tendency toward  minimalism and asymmetry. You can  see the ideologies of “form follows function,” “less is more,” and “ornament as crime” in the buildings. You can see the disappearance of the kind of elaborate, nature-inspired detailing that was present in the greatest buildings across many centuries and cultures. There are no “places for the birds to live,” which is how artist Molly Crabapple describes the nooks and crannies of traditional buildings. (It’s a serious problem, too. The human-driven  decline of bird populations, in addition to being an injustice against birds, has a negative  impact on human happiness.) There is a fierce resistance among many practitioners and academics to returning to traditional forms, which is seen as reactionary or backward or disobeying the rule that architecture must embody the Spirit of Its Time.</p><p> 但是，它显然是真的，我发布的第一批​​图片是当代建筑师不再建造的地方。存在极简主义和不对称的趋势。您可以看到“表格遵循功能”的意识形态，“较少是更多”和“装饰为”作为犯罪“。您可以看到在许多世纪和文化中最伟大的建筑物中存在的精心设计，自然灵感细节的消失。没有“鸟类的地方，”这就是艺术家莫莉拉布普苹果如何描述传统建筑物的角落和缝隙。 （这也是一个严重的问题。除了对鸟类的不公正之外，人类的人类驱动的衰落对人类的幸福也存在负面影响。）许多从业者和学术界都有激烈的抵抗，以回归传统形式，这被视为反动或落后或违背架构必须体现其时间精神的规则。 </p><p>  I think part of the problem has been that most of the people who talk about Tradition in architecture and lament contemporary minimalist styles  have been reactionaries whose values are hideous and whose idea of Tradition involves mindlessly replicating the Greeks and Italians. Books critical of contemporary architecture tend to be written by conservatives, e.g.,   Architecture of the Absurd  by Boston University president (and lifelong enemy of Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky) John Silber, or  From Bauhaus to Our House by Tom Wolfe. Prince Charles has been a vocal opponent of contemporary architecture, and built a town that architecture critics blasted as an “embarrassing anachronism” and attempt to return to an imaginary idyllic past. (Though it’s  actually kind of cool, with a wonderfully crazy and unpredictable street layout that makes it, at the very least,  not boring.) Donald Trump infamously issued an order stating that federal buildings should be built in neoclassical styles, since it’s what the Founding Fathers would have wanted and is more Beautiful. The order was even called “ Make Federal Buildings Beautiful Again.” The American Institute of Architects was horrified and strenuously objected.</p><p>我认为这部分问题一直是谈论建筑和哀叹的传统的大多数人都是反动的，其价值观是丑陋，其传统的想法涉及无意识地复制希腊和意大利人。批评当代建筑的批评往往是由保守派书写的，例如，波士顿大学总裁（Howard Zinn和Noam Chomsky的终身敌人）John Silber的荒谬建筑，或者来自Tom Wolfe的Bauhaus到我们的房子。查尔斯王子一直是当代建筑的声带对手，建造了建筑批评者作为“令人尴尬的不舒服主义”的城镇，并试图恢复想象中的田园诗般的过去。 （虽然它实际上是酷，但是一个非常疯狂和不可预测的街道布局，最重要的是，不是无聊。）唐纳德特朗普纯粹发出了一个令人诗令，说明了联邦建筑应该建造在新古典主义风格中，因为这是什么创始父亲会想要，更美丽。订单甚至呼吁“再次让联邦建筑”。美国建筑师研究所被恐惧和艰苦反对。</p><p> At its worst, neoclassical nostalgia gives us the horrifying McMansion, well-documented in the brilliant  McMansion Hell blog by Kate Wagner. McMansions are what happens when you have too much money and think the more Corinthian columns you put on your house, the fancier it is. The most extreme example may be the  85,000 square-foot “Versailles” mega-mansion in Florida that a local timeshare magnate has been building for over a decade.</p><p> 在最糟糕的是，新古典主义的怀旧让我们为我们提供了令人恐惧的McMansion，凯特·瓦格纳的辉煌麦克马尼奥地狱博客当你有太多的钱并认为你放在你房子里的哥林斯柱越多，它是愚蠢的。最极端的例子可能是佛罗里达州的85,000平方英尺的“凡尔赛”Mega-Mansion，当地时间纪略的巨头已经建成了十多年。</p><p> It’s perfectly understandable to me that the right has given words like nostalgia, history, culture, and tradition a bad name, so that some cannot even  hear them without shuddering a little. For many of the people who use these terms, they connote a vision that is ugly, fake, and deeply racist. I am not surprised, then, that leftists tend to prefer Brutalism to McMansions.</p><p> 对我来说，对我来说是完全理解的，右边有像怀旧，历史，文化和传统一样的糟糕名字，所以有些人甚至不能听到它们而不会颤抖。对于许多使用这些条款的人来说，他们认为丑陋，假和深刻的种族主义的愿景。那么，我并不感到惊讶，左派往往往往对麦克斯国际更喜欢野蛮主义。</p><p> But it is a mistake to reject the cultural inheritance of humankind on the theory that nostalgia is for Nazis. The fact that Donald Trump thinks cheap, tacky pseudo-classical buildings are the only beautiful ones does not mean that  L’Enfant Plaza is a place of majesty that induces feelings of delight in the average beholder. We should not accept the false choice between cold, discordant minimalism and Trumpian fakery. Something wholly new and much better is possible. If we can find it, it can offer an alternative to trying to relive the past.*</p><p> 但拒绝人类的文化遗传是一个错误的人类对Nostalgia是纳粹的理论。唐纳德特朗普认为便宜的事实是唯一意味着L'Enfant Plaza的唯一意味着威严的威严在平均旁观者中感到高兴的地方。我们不应该接受寒冷，不安的简约和王牌的假冒选择。可以全新的东西和更好的事情。如果我们找到它，它可以提供替代尝试重温过去的替代方案。*</p><p> What that will  be, I’m not sure. Personally I find some of  these  utopian  city  illustrations by Owen Carson quite inspiring. I asked the artist who did the cover for my “ memoir from the future,” C.M. Duffy, if he could do a kind of “Gothic futurism” and the result definitely offers a glimpse at the kind of city I’d love to live in:</p><p> 那是什么，我不确定。就个人而言，我发现了一些乌托邦城市插图由欧文卡森非常鼓舞人心。我问艺术家为我的“未来的回忆录”封面做了掩护，“下午Duffy，如果他能做出一种“哥特者未来主义”，而且结果肯定会瞥见我喜欢生活的那种城市：</p><p>  The  Neo-Andean architecture that has sprung up in Bolivia during Evo Morales’ Socialist presidency has also offered a colorful glimpse at something  very different to what we think of as “contemporary” without being hidebound. An example:</p><p>  在Evo Morales社会主义主席期间在玻利维亚举起的新安第斯建筑也在与我们认为“当代”的内容不同而不是隐藏的东西，这也提供了丰富多彩的一瞥。一个例子：</p><p>  I’ve also loved some of the work I’ve seen by Afrofuturist designers, such as these by  Olalekan Jeyifous:</p><p>  我也喜欢我通过奥罗杜特拉伯设计师看到的一些工作，例如Olalekan Jeyifous： </p><p>    Or these models of hypothetical cities and buildings by the late Congolese sculptor Bodys Isek KingelezI.</p><p>或者这些假设城市和建筑模型由晚刚的刚果雕塑家Bodys Isek Kingelezi。</p><p>   New Yorker art critic Peter Schjeldahl comments that “coming upon Kingelez’s work in international shows” always gave a “thrill of refreshment at the beauty and energy they radiate” as compared with much of the “blah fare” in the art world. I agree. But why should Kingelez’s style be confined to art shows? Are our real-world cities never to emanate beauty and energy? Are we forever doomed to do nothing but invent weird new shapes for the same boring glass buildings? Wow, a  skyscraper that’s a big U! Wow,  a wiggly one! Wow, one with  differently sized rectangles! Wow, a  twisty one! Wow, one that  doesn’t go up in a straight line! All of these are marvels from a technological perspective, but that’s about it. They are dreary. They are culturally dead. They have no connection to the natural world.</p><p>   纽约人艺术评论家彼得施谢赫尔评论称“在国庆思想的工作中的工作”总是在艺术世界中的大部分“布拉票”相比，他们宣传了“美丽和能量的令人兴奋”。我同意。但为什么Kingelez的风格仅限于艺术表演？我们的真实城市是否从未融化了美容和能量？我们永远注定为同样无聊的玻璃建筑做出奇怪的新形状吗？哇，一个是一个大的摩天大楼！哇，一个摇摇晃晃的！哇，一个与不同大小的矩形！哇，一个扭曲的！哇，一个没有直线上升的人！所有这些都是从技术角度来看的奇迹，但这是关于它的。他们是沉闷的。他们在文化上死了。他们没有与自然界的联系。</p><p> Here’s what I like about Kingelez and Jeyifous. Jeyifous’ work is intricate. It is overflowing with plant life, so that the life within the space is just as important as anything the architect designs in creating the beauty. It is colorful. It has “human scale,” meaning that Jeyifous emphasizes the space as a space  for people to live their lives and enjoy their world. It is also fun. Kingelez delights the eye. His stuff, too, is fun, and colorful. Both are richly grounded in their cultural traditions. And they don’t look like anything else I’ve ever seen.</p><p> 这是我喜欢的是Kingelez和Jeyifous。 jeyifous的工作是错综复杂的。它充满了植物生活，使得空间内的生活与建筑师设计在创造美丽中的任何东西一样重要。它是色彩缤纷的。它具有“人类规模”，这意味着jeyifous强调了空间作为人们生活生活并享受自己的世界的空间。这也很有趣。 Kingelez欢迎眼睛。他的东西也很有趣，色彩缤纷。两者都在他们的文化传统中很丰富。他们看起来不像我见过的任何东西。</p><p> The qualities I listed as lacking in the Pritzker Prize buildings, then, are far more present here. So, too, in the city that C.M. Duffy drew for me—while it’s sunset in the illustration, and everything is swathed in purple light, I bet those buildings are beautifully colored during the daytime. Not everything has to be colorful, of course. (It can be like  this.) But the central criterion of a beautiful building has to be: does it make people  not want to stop looking at it, because they are so overwhelmed with amazement and pleasure?</p><p> 我列入Pritzker奖品的品质，然后在这里缺乏。所以，在城市中的那个。 Duffy为我开来了 - 当它在图中的日落时，一切都在紫色的光线下，我打赌这些建筑物在白天美妙地着色。当然，并非一切都必须多么多彩。 （它可能是这样的。）但是一个美丽的建筑的中央标准必须是：它会让人们不想停止看它，因为它们是如此令人惊讶和愉快的令人震惊？</p><p> This will involve the return of ornamentation, something abandoned for no good reason. (Or perhaps a reason that seemed good at the time but no longer holds, especially thanks to the continued development of 3-D printing.) It will also involve falling in love with nature. One of the saddest aspects of the places we live and work in is that they are often completely devoid of living things other than ourselves. One of the moments that helped me understand what had gone so horribly wrong with architecture and design came when I was passing through the newly built terminal of the New Orleans airport and saw this:</p><p> 这将涉及装饰的回归，没有充分理由放弃的东西。 （或许是当时似乎擅长的原因，但不再持有，特别是由于3-D印刷的持续发展。）它还将涉及爱上自然。我们生活和工作的地方的最悲伤方面之一是他们往往完全没有自己以外的生物。当我通过新建的新奥尔良机场的新建终端时，有助于我明白建筑和设计的错误，帮助我了解了这么糟糕的错误。</p><p>  It is a two-story picture of a tree, imprinted onto a big monolith. It is there to provide the simulation of a tree to passengers, so that they can almost feel as if they are near a tree.</p><p>  这是一棵树的两层图片，印有一个大型雄黄。它在那里提供了一棵树的模拟到乘客，使他们几乎可以觉得他们靠近一棵树。</p><p> But trees are a real thing. They exist. You can plant them. As I stared at the monolith, I felt depressed by what a pathetic substitute it was, and I realized that in the entire new  $1.3 billion airport terminal, there was hardly a sprig of plant life. It was completely sterile and dead.</p><p> 但树木是一件真实的。它们存在。你可以种植它们。当我盯着整形石时，我感到沮丧的是，它是一种可怜的替代品，我意识到在整个新的13亿美元的机场终端，几乎没有植物生活枝条。它是完全无菌和死亡。 </p><p> If you are among those whose instinctual reaction is “ah, but it would be difficult to put a tree in an airport,” you are only partly right. It is difficult. But it is more than doable.  Singapore’s Changi Airport has an entire indoor forest with 2,200 trees, 100,000 shrubs, and 120 different total species of flora:</p><p>如果你是本能反应的那些“啊，但难以把一棵树放在机场，”你只是部分权利。很难。但它不仅仅是可行的。新加坡的樟宜机场拥有一个整个室内森林，树木，100,000棵灌木，120种不同的植物品种：</p><p>  This is the sort of thing we are capable of. This should not be an exceptional airport. It should be the baseline for airports, the rule rather than the exception. (Changi has won “ best airport in the world” eight years in a row.) Airports are, after all, miserable places to be. You spend hours just sitting around waiting, with nothing to look at except your phone, other depressed passengers, and the steady landing and take-off of endless flights. The presence of waterfalls and forests can relieve this. (Add cats and people will be paying just to hang out in the airport. Or hey, what about peacocks? There is no reason we cannot introduce peacocks to the city.)</p><p>  这是我们能够的那种东西。这不应该是一个特殊的机场。它应该是机场的基线，规则而不是例外。 （樟宜赢得了“世界上最好的机场”连续八年。）机场是毕竟，悲惨的地方。你花了几个小时坐在等待，除了你的手机，其他沮丧的乘客，以及稳定的着陆和无尽的航班的起飞。瀑布和森林的存在可以缓解这一点。 （加入猫和人们将在机场闲逛。或者嘿，孔雀怎么样？没有理由我们不能向城市引入孔雀。）</p><p> There are some exceptions to the general tendency to destroy all other living things in our spaces. I am no fan of Amazon, but when they debuted plans for their new HQ building, I did note that it included something quite amazing:</p><p> 彻底倾向于摧毁我们空间中的所有其他生物的一般倾向。我不是亚马逊的粉丝，但是当他们借鉴他们的新的HQ建筑计划时，我确实注意到它包括一些非常惊人的东西：</p><p>  Yes, it has a wraparound garden pathway going from the bottom to the top. The building itself was laughed at, being yet another example of “what if this skyscraper was a different shape,” in this case the shape being the poop emoji. But look at those dreary office blocks in the left, right, and center and imagine how much nicer it would be to take lunchtime walks up and down the spiral garden. Again, ideas like this should be standard, not weird aberrations.</p><p>  是的，它有一个从底部到顶部的环绕花园途径。建筑本身笑了，是“如果这种摩天大楼是不同的形状，如果这种情况如何，”的另一个例子是巨大的表情诗。但从左侧，右侧和中心看那些沉闷的办公室块，并想象一下午餐时间乘坐多少更好的更好，沿着螺旋花园走。再次，这样的想法应该是标准的，而不是奇怪的像差。</p><p> I genuinely believe that a new design revolution is possible, one that rejects some of the dogmas of the last decades about what can and can’t be done, and that breaks free of the idea that architecture has to “look like its time.” There are so many incredible possibilities for architecture, but the minimalist consensus has got it stuck in a rut, spinning its wheels, producing weird new shape after weird new shape, because people are afraid they’ll be called backward if they admit they like mosaics and gargoyles and friezes and stained glass and other cool stuff.  I like pretty colors or  I like old things makes you a child, an idiot, someone to be laughed at.</p><p> 我真的相信，一个新的设计革命是可能的，一个拒绝过去几十年的一些教条的教条概念，并且无法完成，并且没有造成架构必须“看起来像它的时间”的想法。架构有很多令人难以置信的可能性，但极简主义共识已经陷入了车辙，旋转其轮子，在奇怪的新形状后产生奇怪的新形状，因为人们担心他们会在允许他们喜欢马赛克时向后呼叫和石像乐和楣和彩色玻璃和其他凉爽的东西。我喜欢漂亮的颜色，或者我喜欢旧事让你一个孩子，一个白痴，有人被嘲笑。</p><p> That’s no exaggeration. I’ve published many controversial opinions, but the most vitriol I get is actually not from fans of Ben Shapiro. It’s from architecture snobs who think it is wrong and bad to have a negative reaction to things they have deemed correct. It’s truly vicious. If you’re going to join those who publicly admit they don’t like contemporary architecture, you’re going to be called stupid and reactionary and  completely missing the point. The consensus is so strong that new buildings  around the world all mostly adhere to the Big Shapes school of design. (Interestingly, something equivalent has happened in editorial illustrations where everything has  converged into a uniform blobby minimalist style, though it is not so extreme as in architecture.) But there is some hope. In 2019, I  mentioned a movement called New Maximalism, which I thought I was making up (I even excerpted a fictitious New Maximalist manifesto of my own drafting). But perhaps it was not as fictitious as I thought. Now, according to  Vox, New Maximalism is  actually here. It has so far been confined mostly to Instagram accounts about home decor. It has not yet spread to architecture.  But the tide is turning.</p><p> 这毫不夸张。我发表了许多有争议的意见，但我得到的最多硫醇实际上不是来自Ben Shahiro的粉丝。这是来自架构势利斯，他们认为对他们认为正确的事情产生负面反应是错误的。这真的很恶毒。如果你要加入那些公开承认他们不喜欢当代建筑的人，你将被称为愚蠢和反动，完全错过了这一点。共识是如此强大，世界各地的新建筑大多遵守大型设计学院。 （有趣的是，相同的事情发生在编辑器中，一切都融合到一个统一的Blobby Minimalist风格中，尽管它并不是如此极端。）但有一些希望。 2019年，我提到了一个名为新的最大主义的运动，我以为我正在弥补（我甚至摘要我自己起草的虚构新的最大宣言）。但也许这并不像我想象的那样虚构。现在，根据VOX，新的最大主义实际上是在这里。到目前为止已经被局限于Instagram账户有关家居装饰。它还尚未蔓延到架构。但潮流正在转动。</p><p> So, architects, be bold. Go crazy. Gothic futurism. Do it. They’ll call it  pastiche. They’ll say it’s  ignorantly recycling the past. Whatever. Screw ‘em. Let’s see what wonders can be created if the rules are broken and we start up again where Art Nouveau left off. Study the past closely and take whatever you like from it. Or: let’s create places that are like playgrounds. With rope bridges and secret tunnels and slides. Why the hell not? We’re supposed to be able to produce more, and more efficiently, than ever before. So always add waterfalls, because the sound of flowing water is pleasant and will improve everyone’s lives. If no waterfalls, then your building is no good. There is no reason not to expand our imaginative capacities as far as they will go. Dare to dream of something that looks  completely different to what you see all around you. Something dazzling and surprising. Something breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p> 所以，建筑师，大胆。疯了。哥特者未来主义。做。他们会称之为粉刺。他们会说这是无知的过去回收。任何。螺丝'em。让我们看看如果规则被打破，我们可以创建奇迹是什么，我们又开始了Nouveau离开的地方。密切研究过去并从中采取你喜欢的东西。或者：让我们创造像游乐场一样的地方。绳桥和秘密隧道和幻灯片。为什么不是？我们应该能够比以往任何时候都能生产更多，更高效。所以总是添加瀑布，因为流动的水的声音很愉快，并将提高每个人的生命。如果没有瀑布，那么你的建筑也不好。据没有理由，没有能够扩大我们的富有想象力的能力。敢于梦想完全不同于你周围的东西的东西。令人眼花缭乱和令人惊讶的东西。一些令人叹为观的美丽。 </p><p>  *I vigorously   support  the Campaign To Rebuild The Original Penn Station, for instance, because the gorgeous original design is so superior to anything a contemporary architect has come up with. But I don’t have some obsessive desire to restore the old one because it is old. If it were possible to make something better than the old one, something even more beautiful and fresh, I would want that over the restoration of the demolished station. But contemporary architecture happens to be godawful, so in this case the best available option is to put it back to its stunning original design. Nobody need be nostalgic if we can create something better, but we don’t seem able to, so nostalgic we must be.</p><p>*我大力支持重建原始宾馆的活动，例如，因为华丽的原创设计如此优于一个现代建筑师提出的任何东西。但是我没有一些痴迷愿意恢复旧的欲望，因为它是旧的。如果有可能比旧的东西更好，更美丽和新鲜的东西，我希望在恢复拆迁站的情况下。但是，当代建筑恰好是侄子，所以在这种情况下，最好的选择是将其恢复到它的令人惊叹的原创设计。如果我们可以创造更好的东西，没有人需要怀旧，但我们似乎并不是那么怀旧我们必须是。</p><p>  Note: I have set aside for the purposes of this article the fact that our ugly buildings are all capitalistic megaprojects and thus we cannot change our design until we change our economic system. I am only here trying to get us on the same page as regards the vision, since many leftists still insist on trying to get me to sign onto the depressing   Fuck Yeah Brutalism  position.</p><p>  注意：我已经留出了本文的目的，我们丑陋的建筑物都是资本主义的兆事务，因此我们无法改变我们的设计，直到我们改变经济系统。我只是在这里试图让我们在同一页面上看见视野，因为许多左派仍然坚持试图让我签到令人沮丧的他妈的野蛮地位。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/04/when-is-the-revolution-in-architecture-coming">https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/04/when-is-the-revolution-in-architecture-coming</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/建筑/">#建筑</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
