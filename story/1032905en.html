Strange,  peculiar,  wacky,  weird,  bizarre, and other words indicating enigmatic oddity recur in descriptions of him. “What an intelligent, queer, and sick creature!” remarked Turgenev; another major prose writer, Sergey Aksakov, referred to the “unintelligible strangeness of his spirit.” When Gogol died, the poet Pyotr Vyazemsky sighed, “Your life was an enigma, so is today your death.”</p><p>尼古拉·果戈理(1809-1852)，俄罗斯最伟大的漫画作家，彻底迷惑了他的同时代人。奇怪的、奇特的、古怪的、奇怪的、离奇的，以及其他表示神秘怪异的词语在对他的描述中反复出现。“这是一个多么聪明、古怪和病态的生物啊！”屠格涅夫评论道；另一位主要散文作家谢尔盖·阿克萨科夫(Sergey Aksakov)提到了“他精神上的莫名其妙的奇特之处”。果戈理去世时，诗人彼得·维亚泽姆斯基(Pyotr Vyazemsky)感叹道：“你的生活是一个谜，今天你的死亡也是一个谜。”</p><p> Gogol has remained, in the words of another contemporary, among the world’s most “undeciphered [ nerazgadannykh] people.” “To say that Nikolai Gogol is one of the most controversial figures in Russian literature,” Victor Erlich began his classic study of the writer, “is to offer one of the few noncontroversial statements that can legitimately be made about this remarkable writer.” “I am considered a riddle by everyone,” Gogol observed, and he was no less enigmatic to himself. He hoped that his last work, the second part of his masterpiece  Dead Souls would solve “the riddle of my existence,” but he recognized that it hadn’t, and so just before he died he burned most of it in a literary auto-da-fé.</p><p>用另一位同时代人的话说，果戈理一直是世界上最“未被破译的民族”之一。“说尼古拉·果戈理是俄罗斯文学中最具争议的人物之一，”维克多·埃利希(Victor Erlich)开始了他对这位杰出作家的经典研究，“这是少数几个可以合法地对这位杰出作家做出的无争议的陈述之一。”果戈理说：“每个人都认为我是个谜。”他对自己的神秘感丝毫不减。他希望他的最后一部作品，他的杰作“死亡的灵魂”的第二部分能解开“我存在的谜团”，但他意识到它没有解开，所以就在他死前，他把它的大部分都烧毁在一辆文学汽车里。</p><p> Gogol was born, believe it or not, on April 1 (March 20 on the calendar then in use), 1809, in the little Ukrainian town of Sorochintsy. Appropriately enough, the name “Gogol” was a hoax. When his grandfather, Afanasy Yanovsky, married a wealthy Cossack girl possessing some three hundred serfs, Catherine the Great had just decreed that only nobles could own serfs, so Yanovsky sifted through Ukrainian history until he “discovered” his descent from a seventeenth-century warrior, Ostop Hohol (or Gogol in Russian). His grandson was born Nikolai Gogol-Yanovsky and later chose to keep only the fictitious part of his name.</p><p>信不信由你，果戈理于1809年4月1日(当时使用的日历上的3月20日)出生在乌克兰小镇索罗辛西。恰如其分地，“果戈理”这个名字是个恶作剧。当他的祖父阿法尼希·亚诺夫斯基(Afanasy Yanovsky)娶了一个拥有大约300名农奴的富有的哥萨克女孩时，凯瑟琳大帝(Catherine The Great)刚刚颁布法令，只有贵族才能拥有农奴，所以亚诺夫斯基仔细研究了乌克兰的历史，直到他“发现”他的后裔是17世纪的勇士奥斯普·霍霍尔(Ostop Hoho，俄语中是果戈理)。他的孙子原名尼古拉·果戈理-亚诺夫斯基(Nikolai Gogol-Yanovsky)，后来选择只保留他名字的虚构部分。</p><p> Gogol’s father, a small landowner who wrote bad comedies and worked as a sort of court jester for a wealthy dignitary, died when Gogol was sixteen. Biographers love to dwell on Gogol’s overprotective mother, who not only falsely attributed countless literary works to him (including, to his dismay, very bad ones) but also remained convinced that he had invented the steamboat, the railroad, and every other major technological innovation of the day. The religion she imparted to him centered not on God but on the devil, and throughout Gogol’s masterpieces the devil hides in the most unlikely places.</p><p>果戈理的父亲是个小地主，写过糟糕的喜剧，为一位富有的权贵当过宫廷小丑，在果戈理16岁时去世。传记作家喜欢详述果戈理过度保护的母亲，她不仅错误地将无数的文学作品归功于他(令他沮丧的是，非常糟糕的作品)，而且仍然相信他发明了汽船、铁路和当时所有其他重大的技术创新。她传授给他的宗教不是以上帝为中心，而是以魔鬼为中心，而在果戈理的杰作中，魔鬼隐藏在最不可能的地方。</p><p> At boarding school, where he was known as the “mysterious dwarf” and was, in his own words, “suspicious of everyone,” he began his first work, a derivative romantic poem,  Hans Küchelgarten. Upon graduation, burning with desire to “serve the state,” he set out for St. Petersburg, where his connections proved worthless and he could find no better employment than as a low-level clerk. When he published  Hans Küchelgarten at his own expense, it received only two reviews, both scathing. His reaction set the pattern for future disappointments: having destroyed every copy of his poem that he could find, he fled abroad to Germany.</p><p>在寄宿学校，他被称为“神秘的侏儒”，用他自己的话说，“对每个人都持怀疑态度”，他开始了他的第一部作品，一首衍生的浪漫诗“汉斯·库尔加滕”(Hans Küchelgarten)。毕业后，怀着“为国家服务”的强烈愿望，他出发前往圣彼得堡，在那里，他的人脉被证明一文不值，他找不到比做一名低级职员更好的工作。当他自费出版“汉斯·库切尔加滕”时，只收到了两篇评论，都是严厉的。他的反应为未来的失望设定了模式：在销毁了他能找到的每一本诗后，他逃到了国外的德国。</p><p> To pay for his trip, he appropriated the money his mother had sent to pay the mortgage on their estate in Ukraine. Justifying himself, he composed a letter inventing a failed romance with an inaccessible “goddess lightly clothed in human passion,” an ethereal being “whose shattering splendor impresses itself upon the heart.” But why go abroad? In a second letter, in which he apparently forgot what he had said in the first, he explained that he sought treatment for a terrible rash. Putting two and two together, his mother concluded that he had contracted a venereal disease from a courtesan, a conclusion all the more odd because for his whole life Gogol was repulsed by sexuality.</p><p>为了支付旅费，他挪用了母亲寄来的钱来支付他们在乌克兰的房产抵押贷款。为自己辩护，他写了一封信，与一位难以接近的“披着人类激情的女神”写了一封失败的罗曼史，一个空灵的存在，“她那令人震撼的光辉给人留下了深刻的印象”。但是为什么要出国呢？在第二封信中，他显然忘记了第一封信中说的话，他解释说，他因严重的皮疹而寻求治疗。综合来看，他的母亲得出结论，他是从一个妓女那里感染了性病，这一结论更加奇怪，因为果戈理一生都对性行为反感。</p><p> When Gogol returned to St. Petersburg, he obtained a minor civil service position and, more importantly, made the acquaintance of Russia’s leading writers, including Pushkin, who (or so Gogol claimed) suggested to him the plots of  Dead Souls and his play—considered by many Russia’s greatest— The Inspector General. Exploiting the fad for stories with local color, he published some well-crafted Ukrainian tales featuring witches, demons, and dashing Cossacks. His finest works—stories, plays, and his novel—soon followed. I know of no stories funnier than “The Tale of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich,” “Nevsky Avenue,” “The Diary of a Madman,” and his two best, “The Nose” and “The Overcoat.” According to an (implausible) anecdote, when  The Inspector General was staged with Nicholas I in attendance, the usually humorless tsar remarked appreciatively, “Everybody got his come-uppance, and I most of all.”</p><p>当果戈理回到圣彼得堡时，他获得了一个次要的公务员职位，更重要的是，他结识了包括普希金在内的俄罗斯主要作家，普希金(至少果戈理声称是这样)向他建议了死魂的情节和他的戏剧-许多俄罗斯最伟大的监察长-认为是这样的。他利用这一时尚寻找具有地方色彩的故事，出版了一些精心制作的乌克兰故事，以巫婆、恶魔和潇洒的哥萨克为特色。他最好的作品--故事、戏剧和他的小说--很快就接踵而至。据我所知，没有比“伊万·伊万诺维奇如何与伊万·尼基福罗维奇争吵的故事”、“涅夫斯基大道”、“狂人日记”，以及他最好的两部作品“鼻子”和“大衣”更有趣的了。根据一个(令人难以置信的)轶事，当监察长在尼古拉斯一世在场的情况下上台时，这位通常不苟言笑的沙皇赞赏地说：“每个人都有他的报应，而我最重要。”</p><p> The play was successful, but Gogol, apparently shocked by some criticisms, again fled abroad, where, except for two visits to Russia, he stayed for twelve years. It was as if he were fleeing from existence, or at least Russian existence, as he had described it. Life, he feared, was nothing but unremitting  poshlost, a word that, as Nabokov explained in his delightful book  Nikolai Gogol, means something like extreme vulgarity, unrelieved shabbiness, and sheer grossness, all combined with the pretense of taste and culture. According to Gogol, Pushkin</p><p>这出戏很成功，但果戈理显然被一些批评所震惊，再次逃往国外，除了两次访问俄罗斯外，他在那里呆了12年。就像他所描述的那样，他似乎是在逃离存在，或者至少是逃离俄罗斯的存在。他担心，生活只不过是无休止的迷失，</p><p>  would always tell me that no other writer has had the ability to portray so vividly the  poshlost’ of life, to sketch in so forcefully the  poshlost’ of a “poshlyj” man so that trifles which could easily escape one loom so large that no one would miss them.</p><p>我总是告诉我，没有其他作家有能力如此生动地描绘生活的失落，如此有力地勾勒出一个“失落的”人的失落，以至于那些可以轻易逃过一台织布机的琐事如此之大，以至于没有人会错过它们。</p><p> Dead Souls, which he completed abroad, depicts a world so replete with  poshlost and a hero so filled with vacuity that, as its narrator famously remarks, laughter shades into tears.</p><p>他在国外完成的“死去的灵魂”描绘了一个充斥着失落的世界和一个充满空虚的英雄的世界，正如叙述者著名的话所说，笑声变成了泪水。</p><p> After these amazing successes, something strange enough to form the plot of one of his stories happened. In 1842–1843 Gogol experienced a religious crisis, wrote letters combining self-exaltation with masochistic self-loathing, and concluded that he was called to be a great moral teacher. In this mood, he published the scandalous  Selected Passages from Correspondence with Friends (1847), in which he preached that social conditions, including serfdom, are God-given, that the Russian Orthodox clergy “alone is in a position to solve all our problems,” and that no one can be saved without loving Russia. Convinced of the profundity of these banal ideas and of his stature as a Christian teacher, he urged people to refrain from erecting a statue to him after his death and to read over his instructive letters many times: “Woe to those who do not heed my word! Leave all things for a while, leave all such pleasures that tickle your fancy at idle moments. Obey me.” Conservatives and Slavophiles were as irritated as radicals and Westernizers. As readers have observed ever since, Gogol seemed to have turned into one of his grotesque characters.</p><p>在取得这些惊人的成功之后，一些奇怪的事情发生了，足以构成他的一个故事的情节。在1842-1843年，果戈理经历了一场宗教危机，他写了一封信，将自我提升与受虐狂的自我厌恶结合起来，并得出结论，他被称为一名伟大的道德老师。在这种情绪下，他出版了“与朋友通信”(1847年)中可耻的选段，在其中他宣扬包括农奴制在内的社会状况是上帝赋予的，俄罗斯东正教神职人员“只有自己才有能力解决我们所有的问题”，如果不热爱俄罗斯，任何人都无法获救。他深信这些陈腐思想的深刻性和他作为一名基督教教师的地位，敦促人们不要在他死后为他竖立雕像，并多次阅读他的教育信件：“那些不听从我的话的人有祸了！暂时放下所有的事情，把那些在空闲时刻逗乐你的快乐都抛在脑后。听我的。“。保守派和嗜斯拉夫主义者和激进分子和西方人一样恼火。读者从那时起就观察到，果戈理似乎变成了他笔下的怪诞人物之一。</p><p> Russia’s most influential critic, Vissarion Belinsky, was especially disappointed to discover that the author he had hailed as the hope of Russian literature, and who he had assumed was a radical, turned out to be a reactionary. His open “Letter to Gogol” called his erstwhile hero a “preacher of the knout, apostle of ignorance, defender of obscurantism.” When Dostoevsky was arrested in 1849, one of the charges against him was circulating Belinsky’s letter.</p><p>俄罗斯最有影响力的批评家维萨里昂·别林斯基(Vissarion Belinsky)尤其失望地发现，这位他曾称赞为俄罗斯文学希望的作家，他曾认为他是一个激进的作家，结果却是一个反动派。他的公开信“致果戈理的信”称他昔日的英雄是“愚昧的传教士、无知的使徒、蒙昧的捍卫者”。1849年陀思妥耶夫斯基被捕时，对他的其中一项指控是传阅别林斯基的信。</p><p> To redeem his frivolous comic works, Gogol tried to draft a second volume of  Dead Souls, in which its hero, Chichikov, was to suffer and, coming under the influence of wholly positive characters, begin to reform. If volume one was an inferno, volume two would be a purgatorio, and perhaps there would even be a paradiso. Needless to say, Gogol couldn’t force his genius in this direction. Mikhail Bakhtin called this failed attempt to take satire where it could not go “the tragedy of a genre.”</p><p>为了挽回他轻浮的漫画作品，果戈理试图起草第二卷“死魂”，书中的主人公奇奇科夫在完全积极的人物的影响下，开始改革。如果第一卷是地狱，第二卷就是炼狱，甚至可能会有天堂。不用说，果戈理不能强迫他的天才朝这个方向发展。米哈伊尔·巴赫金(Mikhail Bakhtin)称这种试图将讽刺带到无法达到的地方的失败尝试是“一种体裁的悲剧”。</p><p> Gogol’s religious mania kept getting worse. A trip to the Holy Land did not alleviate his moral hypochondria. Eventually, he fell under the influence of the fanatic Father Matvey, who urged him to abandon literature as sinful. For weeks Gogol did not eat—Nabokov recounts that you could feel his spine through his stomach—and he died with doctors torturing him with leeches hanging from his gigantic nose. This ending is all the more grotesque since Gogol was obsessed with noses, snorts, sneezes, mustaches, whiskers, smells of all kinds, and countless Russian idioms involving the olfactory (Nabokov devotes a page to listing them). His last words—“A ladder! A ladder!”—apparently expressed his lifelong wish to rise above what the narrator of  Dead Souls calls “the slimy mass of minutiae that has bogged down our life.”</p><p>果戈理的宗教狂热愈演愈烈。圣地之旅并没有减轻他的道德忧郁症。最终，在狂热的马特维神父的影响下，他堕落了，马特维神父敦促他放弃文学，认为它是有罪的。果戈理有几个星期没有进食-纳博科夫回忆说，你可以通过他的胃感觉到他的脊椎-他死时医生用挂在他巨大鼻子上的水蛭折磨他。自从果戈理痴迷于鼻子、鼻子、喷嚏、胡子、胡须、各种气味，以及无数与嗅觉有关的俄语习语(纳博科夫用了一页的篇幅列出了这些习语)，这个结局就变得更加离奇了。他的遗言--“梯子！一架梯子！“-显然表达了他毕生的愿望，想要超越”死魂“的叙述者所说的”让我们的生活陷入困境的黏糊糊的细枝末节“。</p><p> Since much of Gogol’s humor depends on linguistic play, he has proven resistant to adequate translation. Most renditions of  Dead Souls aren’t funny, and what is the point of reading a comic novel that isn’t funny? The one exception is the brilliant version done more than seventy-five years ago by Bernard Guilbert Guerney, which has been available in Susanne Fusso’s judicious revision since 1996. At the beginning of the novel, the hero’s servant,</p><p>由于果戈理的幽默在很大程度上依赖于语言游戏，他已经被证明抵制适当的翻译。“死魂”的大多数译本都不好笑，而读一本不好笑的漫画小说又有什么意义呢？唯一的例外是伯纳德·吉尔伯特·格尔尼(Bernard Guilbert Guerney)75年前完成的精彩版本，自1996年以来，苏珊·福索(Susanne Fusso)的明智修订本就提供了这一版本。在小说的开头，主人公的仆人，</p><p> Petrushka the flunky…began settling himself in the tiny anteroom…whither he had already brought…a certain odor all his own, which had been also imparted to the bag he brought in next, containing sundry flunkyish effects.</p><p>卑鄙的…彼得鲁什卡。开始在小小的接待室…安顿下来。他已经把…带到了哪里。一种完全是他自己的气味，这气味也传到了他接下来带来的袋子里，里面有各种各样的跟班效果。</p><p> “Sundry flunkyish effects” is what Gogol often sounds like, but George Reavey’s version makes it “the sack in which he kept his toilet accessories and which he brought in later,” which is not at all funny.</p><p>“各种各样的跟班效果”是果戈理经常听起来的样子，但乔治·里维(George Reavey)的版本把它变成了“他放马桶配件的袋子，后来他带来了这个袋子”，这一点都不好笑。</p><p> Now Fusso has done an excellent job with some of Gogol’s stories. In his funniest tale, “The Nose,” Major Kovalyov wakes up to discover that his nose is missing—there is nothing but a flat space where it used to be—and goes off in quest of it. He ascertains that the nose has somehow turned into a full-grown, high-ranking official, who evidently has enjoyed a long career, which means that the past, too, has been altered. A mere major, Kovalyov can’t decide how to address the distinguished nose whom he finds praying “with the greatest piety” in the Kazan Cathedral. When Kovalyov finally manages to say that the nose ought to know his place, his former appendage replies that what Kovalyov says makes no sense, which is the most sensible line in the story.</p><p>现在，扶索在果戈理的一些故事中做得非常出色。在他最滑稽的故事“鼻子”中，科瓦廖夫少校醒来后发现他的鼻子不见了--原来的鼻子只有一块平坦的地方--然后就去找它了。他断定，鼻子不知何故变成了一个成熟的高级官员，显然他的职业生涯很长，这意味着过去的事情也已经改变了。科瓦廖夫只是一名少校，他无法决定如何向他发现在喀山大教堂“以最虔诚的心”祈祷的杰出的鼻子说话。当科瓦廖夫最终设法说鼻子应该知道他的位置时，他以前的附属品回答说，科瓦廖夫说的毫无意义，这是故事中最明智的台词。</p><p>  Only at the tale’s conclusion does Gogol’s narrator reflect that these events are “indeed strange” ( tochno stranno)—as if he isn’t too sure and wants to preclude doubt. Andrew MacAndrew’s translation dampens the joke by referring simply to the event’s “strangeness.” In Fusso’s version the narrator identifies something still stranger: “How did Kovalyov not realize that you cannot go to a newspaper office to place an advertisement about a nose?” Like any good humorist, Gogol ends the sentence with the funniest word— nose—but other translators—MacAndrew, Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, and Constance Garnett—all end it with the newspaper office. Fusso’s ear for humor makes all the difference.</p><p>只有在故事结束时，果戈理的叙述者才反映出这些事件“确实很奇怪”(Tochno Stranno)-似乎他不太确定，想要排除怀疑。安德鲁·麦克安德鲁(Andrew MacAndrew)的翻译简单地提到了事件的“陌生性”，从而削弱了这个笑话。在福索的版本中，叙述者发现了一些更奇怪的东西：“科瓦廖夫怎么会没有意识到，你不能去报社刊登关于鼻子的广告呢？”像任何一位优秀的幽默作家一样，果戈理在句子的结尾用了最有趣的单词-鼻子-但其他译者-麦克安德鲁、理查德·佩维尔、拉丽莎·沃罗洪斯基和康斯坦斯·加内特-都在报社结束了句子。福索对幽默的敏锐洞察力决定了一切的不同之处。</p><p> Everywhere Gogol describes a world of incandescent inanity. Things may look fascinating, variegated, and endlessly interesting, as the narrators of his stories sometimes suggest at their beginnings, but by the end the world’s metaphysical boredom shines through. As the narrator of “Ivan Ivanovich and Ivan Nikiforovich” leaves the town where the eponymous heroes have been quarreling for years about utter triviality, he reflects,</p><p>无处不在的果戈理描述了一个白热化的空虚世界。正如他的故事的叙述者有时在开始时所暗示的那样，事情可能看起来令人着迷，五花八门，而且无休止的有趣，但到了最后，世界上的形而上学的无聊闪耀着光芒。当“伊万·伊万诺维奇和伊万·尼基福罗维奇”(Ivan Ivanovich And Ivan Nikiforovich)的叙述者离开这座小镇时，他反思道，这两位同名英雄多年来一直在为微不足道的小事争吵不休。</p><p> The damp pierced me through and through…. Again the same fields,…the drenched cows and crows, the monotonous rain, the tearful sky without one gleam of light in it: It’s boring in this world, gentlemen!</p><p>湿透了我的全身，穿透了…。。同样的字段，…。浑身湿透的牛和乌鸦，单调的雨，没有一丝光芒的泪流满面的天空：先生们，这世界太无聊了！</p><p> Gogol creates conversations so insipid as to achieve a kind of negative sublimity. The hero of one early story, “Ivan Fyodorovich Shponka and His Auntie,” is proud to utter such profundities as: “I had occasion to observe what distant lands there are in the world!” and “There are a great many flies in summer, Madam!” When Shponka reads, it is always the same book, much as</p><p>果戈理创造的对话如此平淡，以至于达到了一种消极的崇高。早期故事的主人公“伊万·费奥多罗维奇·施蓬卡和他的姑姑”自豪地说出了这样的深奥之处：“我有机会观察到世界上有多么遥远的土地！”还有“夏天苍蝇很多，夫人！”当Shponka阅读时，它总是同一本书，很像。</p><p> a government clerk will read a directory of addresses with immense satisfaction several times a day with no ulterior object; he is simply entertained by the printed list of names. “Ah, Ivan Gavrilovich So-and-so!” he mutters mutely to himself…and next time he reads it over again with exactly the same exclamations.</p><p>一名政府职员每天会非常满意地阅读一本地址名录，没有别有用心；他只是看着印刷的名单而感到愉悦。“啊，伊万·加夫里洛维奇某某！”他悄悄地自言自语…。下一次，他带着完全相同的感叹再读一遍。</p><p> A character in  Dead Souls reads anything thrust into his hands because understanding is beside the point: what he loves is “the very process of reading—look and behold ye, some word or other inevitably emerged from out of the welter of letters, even though, at times, the Devil alone knew what that word meant.”</p><p>“死魂”中的一个人物读任何塞进他手中的东西，因为理解是无关紧要的：他喜欢的是“阅读的过程-看看吧，你看，一些单词或其他不可避免地从乱七八糟的字母中出现，尽管有时只有魔鬼知道那个词的意思。”</p><p> Motion that takes one nowhere, energy expended on nothing, and activity divorced from its purpose create a semblance of biographies lived by a simulacrum of people. In  Dead Souls, one character, Nozdryov, lies preposterously for the sake of lying, even against his own interests, and another, Plyushkin, takes stinginess so far that it actually impoverishes him. “And is it to such insignificance, such pettiness, such vileness that a man could sink?” asks the narrator. Many critics have remarked that Gogol’s people are homunculi or pre-individuals hovering “on the very edge of nonentity,” as the nineteenth-century critic Apollon Grigoriev described the hero of “The Overcoat.”</p><p>无处可走的运动，毫无意义的精力消耗，以及脱离其目的的活动，都会制造出一种假象人生活的传记。在“死亡的灵魂”中，一个角色诺兹德里约夫为了撒谎而荒谬地撒谎，甚至违背了他自己的利益，而另一个角色普柳什金则吝啬到让他变得穷困潦倒的地步。“难道它是如此微不足道，如此小气，如此卑鄙，以至于一个人都会堕落吗？”讲述者问道。正如19世纪评论家阿波隆·格里戈里耶夫(Apollon Grigoriev)所描述的那样，许多批评家认为果戈理的人是徘徊在“虚无的边缘”的古人或前个体。</p><p> Do these characters have souls? When the public prosecutor in  Dead Souls dies, only then do the townspeople discover that he had had a soul at all, “although out of modesty he had never flaunted it.” Even their animal appetites are confined to eating. Gogol’s version of an idyllic married couple, his Baucis and Philemon, in “Old World Landowners” do nothing but feed each other little treats, and his narrators describe endless dishes with such enthusiasm that, Solzhenitsyn reports, the hungry prisoners of Stalin’s Gulag banned the very name Gogol. Some characters are so plant-like that their behavior consists of tropisms: in “Nevsky Avenue,” “a young lady…turns her head toward the glittering shop windows as the sunflower turns to the sun.”</p><p>这些人物有灵魂吗？当“死魂”中的公诉人死后，镇上的人才发现他有灵魂，“虽然出于谦虚，他从来没有炫耀过灵魂。”甚至他们对动物的胃口也仅限于吃。在“旧世界地主”中，果戈理描述了一对田园诗般的已婚夫妇，他的鲍西斯和菲利蒙，除了互相喂食，什么也不做，他的解说员如此热情地描述着无穷无尽的菜肴，索尔仁尼琴报道，斯大林古拉格的饥饿囚犯禁止了果戈理这个名字。有些角色非常像植物，他们的行为由取向组成：在“涅夫斯基大道”中，“一位年轻的女士…。当向日葵转向太阳时，她把头转向闪闪发光的商店橱窗。“。</p><p> Without a soul to hold a person together, a body part—especially a nose—may entirely detach itself. The insane hero of “The Diary of a Madman” reasons that people cannot see their own noses because noses have all decamped to the moon. Sometimes a facial feature seems to have taken over a life. On Nevsky Avenue, “you meet marvelous mustaches…to which the better part of a life has been devoted.” There is even “a mustache that reduces one to stupefaction.”</p><p>没有灵魂将人凝聚在一起，身体的一部分--尤其是鼻子--可能会完全分离。《狂人日记》中精神错乱的男主角辩解说，人们看不到自己的鼻子，因为鼻子都飞到了月球上。有时，一个面部特征似乎已经接管了一条生命。在纳夫斯基大道上，“你会遇到令人惊叹的八字胡…。为之奉献了大半生的时间。“。甚至还有“让人目瞪口呆的胡子”。</p><p> Gogol’s best-known tale, “The Overcoat,” is a study in subtraction. How much can you take from a person while leaving him, if just barely, human? The hero, Akaky Akakievich— kakat in Russian baby-talk means “to shit”—has, literally and figuratively, almost no words of his own. He uses filler after meaningless filler— er,  you know,  well,  like—and sometimes never gets any further. He is not only a copying clerk—a sort of human Xerox machine—he also finds in copying “a vision of his own multifarious and pleasant world…. Some of the letters were his favorites, and when he got to them he was beside himself.” At home, he makes copies for his own pleasure.</p><p>果戈理最著名的故事“大衣”是对减法的研究。你可以从一个人身上拿到多少钱，而同时离开他，即使只是勉强算得上是人类呢？男主人公阿卡基·阿卡基耶维奇(Akaky Akakievich)在俄语中婴儿谈话的意思是“拉屎”，从字面上和比喻上看，他几乎没有自己的话。他一个接一个地使用无意义的填充词-你知道，嗯，就像-有时永远不会走得更远。他不仅是一名复印员--一种人类施乐复印机--他还在复印中发现了“对他自己繁杂而愉快的世界的一种憧憬”(…。。有几封信是他的最爱，当他拿到的时候，他不知所措。“。在家里，他为了自娱自乐而复印。</p><p> Though utterly neglectful of his clothes, Akaky Akakievich is at last forced by the Russian winter to replace his impossibly worn overcoat. To save enough for a new one, he eats less and walks “almost on tiptoe” to spare shoe leather. But he has his dream. Though hungry, “he was nourished spiritually, bearing in his thoughts the eternal idea of the future overcoat.” His life becomes fuller,</p><p>虽然阿卡基·阿卡基耶维奇完全忽略了他的衣服，但他最终还是被俄罗斯的冬天逼得不得不更换他那件不可能穿坏的大衣。为了省下足够的钱买新的，他吃得更少，走路时“几乎踮起脚尖”以腾出鞋皮。但他有他的梦想。虽然饿了，但“他的精神得到了滋养，他的思想中蕴含着对未来大衣的永恒想法。”他的生活变得更加充实，</p><p> as if he had gotten married…as if…a pleasant female life companion had agreed to follow life’s path along with him—and that companion was none other than the thickly padded overcoat with a strong lining showing no trace of wear.</p><p>就好像他嫁给了…一样。就像…一样。一位和蔼可亲的女性生活伴侣同意和他一起走人生的道路--这位同伴正是那件厚厚的衬里坚固的大衣，丝毫没有磨损的痕迹。</p><p> No sooner is the coat completed—“the most extremely solemn day in the life of Akaky Akakievich”—than it is stolen. For the first time he breaks protocol to appeal directly to a “significant personage” (who until recently “had been an insignificant personage”), but he is one of those Gogol characters who have no self outside their rank. He loves to nonplus subordinates by demanding, “How dare you! Do you know who you’re talking to?” When he rebukes Akaky Akakievich, the poor clerk goes home and dies.</p><p>这件外套刚完成--“阿卡基·阿卡基耶维奇一生中最庄严的一天”--就被偷了。这是他第一次打破常规，直接向一位“重要人物”(直到最近还“还是一个微不足道的人物”)发出呼吁，但他是果戈理角色中的一员，他们在自己的级别之外没有自我。他喜欢对没有加分的下属发号施令：“你怎么敢这样！你知道你在跟谁说话吗？“。当他责备Akaky Akakievich时，可怜的店员回家就死了。</p><p> But that is not the end of the story. Reports circulate that a corpse, which someone recognizes as Akaky Akakievich, has been haunting the streets, muttering unintelligibly, and demanding people’s overcoats. The police issue an order “to catch the corpse at all costs, dead or alive, and to punish him in the cruelest fashion, as an example to others.” In Gogol, even the supernatural is often banal, and no less terrifying for that.</p><p>但这并不是故事的结束。报道称，一具身体，有人认出是Akaky Akakievich，一直在街上出没，莫名其妙地喃喃自语，并要求人们穿上大衣。警方下达命令，“不惜一切代价抓住身体，不管是死是活，并以最残忍的方式惩罚他，以身作则”。在果戈理，即使是超自然现象通常也是平庸的，因此也同样令人恐惧。</p><p> Gogol’s world is populated by impersonators, counterfeits, and confidence men, voids made flesh. The title  Dead Souls refers literally to a palpable nothing. A Russian landowner’s wealth and tax liability were determined by the number of “souls”—adult male serfs—that he owned. Between censuses, landowners were obliged to pay taxes on serfs who died—that is, on “dead souls.” Chichikov, the novel’s hero, arrives in a provincial town, charms the local officials with his extravagant flattery and chameleon-like ability to share their obsessions, and then visits landowners in the surrounding countryside. After making himself the perfect listener, he offers to buy a landowner’s dead souls—that is, to execute an official deed of purchase listing the souls as if they were living. The landowner would benefit in two ways: from whatever payment he received and from eliminating his tax liability. Only at the novel’s end do we learn that Chichikov plans to use this legally attested property as collateral for a mortgage.</p><p>果戈理的世界充斥着冒名顶替者、冒牌货和骗子，虚无缥缈的肉体。“死魂”这个标题字面上指的是明显的虚无。一名俄罗斯地主的财富和纳税义务取决于他拥有的“灵魂”(成年男性农奴)的数量。在两次人口普查之间，地主必须为死亡的农奴--即“死去的灵魂”--缴税。小说中的主人公奇奇科夫来到一个省级小镇，用他奢侈的奉承和变色龙般的能力迷住了当地官员，分享他们的痴迷，然后拜访了周围乡村的地主。在使自己成为完美的倾听者之后，他提出购买一个地主死去的灵魂-也就是说，执行一份官方的购买契约，列出这些灵魂，就像他们还活着一样。土地所有者将以两种方式受益：从他收到的任何付款中受益，以及从免除他的纳税义务中受益。只有在小说的结尾，我们才知道奇奇科夫计划用这一经过法律证明的财产作为抵押。</p><p> Sometimes Chichikov has trouble making a landowner understand his proposition. Korobochka, the narrator explains, is one of those people who, no matter what arguments you use, cannot shift their way of thinking. She worries that she “might take a loss somehow.” To no avail does Chichikov ask, How can you take a loss on nothing, and how can you need something that exists only on paper? Another landowner, Sobakevich, drives a hard bargain: “You hold a human soul at the same value as a boiled turnip. Give me three rubles at least.” When Sobakevich claims to be “taking a loss,” Chichikov points out that what he is selling is nothing, a fiction, an insubstantial shadow, a puff of air, of no good to anyone. Perhaps so, Sobakevich replies, but then, of what good are the living? “They are so many flies, not people!”</p><p>有时奇奇科夫很难让地主理解他的主张。叙述者解释说，科罗博奇卡是这样一种人，无论你使用什么论点，都不能改变他们的思维方式。她担心自己“可能会以某种方式蒙受损失”。奇奇科夫无济于事地问，你怎么能一无所有地吃亏，你怎么能需要一些只存在于纸面上的东西呢？另一位地主索巴凯维奇(Sobakevich)进行了一次艰难的讨价还价：“你把一个人的灵魂和一个煮熟的萝卜看齐了。至少给我三卢布。“。当索巴凯维奇自称“吃亏”时，奇奇科夫指出，他卖的东西什么都不是，是虚构的，是虚幻的，是虚无缥缈的影子，是一阵风，对任何人都没有好处。索巴凯维奇回答说，也许是这样，但是，活着的人有什么好处呢？“他们是这么多苍蝇，不是人！”</p><p> Returning to town, Chichikov, like the devil, peruses with delight the list of souls he has acquired. When he is asked if he has sufficient land for so many serfs, he replies, “As much as will suffice for the peasants I bought.” Someone worries about an uprising among these uprooted people, but Chichikov explains that they “were extraordinarily docile in character.”</p><p>回到镇上，奇奇科夫像魔鬼一样，兴高采烈地研读着他所获得的灵魂名单。当被问到他是否有足够的土地供养这么多农奴时，他回答说：“足够我买来的农民吃的了。”有人担心这些背井离乡的人会起义，但奇奇科夫解释说，他们“性格非常温顺”。</p><p> When it comes out that he has been buying dead souls, the townspeople labor to understand why anyone would want them. Perhaps, they reflect, the very phrase “dead souls” has a hidden meaning, which each person discovers to be his own worst transgression. For that matter, they ask, who is Chichikov? Perhaps he is a government inspector in disguise? The fact that he doesn’t act as if he is in disguise only proves how good a disguise it is. Farfetched theories generate still more farfetched theories. Could Chichikov be Napoleon, who has somehow escaped from Elba and sneaked into Russia to corner the market on dead souls? Maybe he is really…the antichrist? If readers object that all this is quite improbable, the narrator remarks, they should watch how scholars develop their favorite theories.</p><p>当得知他一直在收买死灵时，镇上的人们努力想明白为什么会有人想要他们。也许，他们认为，“死去的灵魂”这句话本身就有一个隐藏的含义，每个人都发现这是他自己最严重的过错。就此而言，他们会问，奇奇科夫是谁？也许他是一个伪装的政府巡视员？他没有伪装，这一事实只能证明他的伪装有多好。牵强的理论会产生更牵强的理论。奇奇科夫可能是拿破仑吗？他不知何故从厄尔巴岛逃了出来，潜入俄罗斯垄断市场，抢占死人的市场？也许他真的是…。反基督者？如果读者反对这一切都是不太可能的，叙述者说，他们应该看看学者们是如何发展他们喜欢的理论的。</p><p> The human inclination to treat lack of evidence as evidence—an inescapable feature of conspiracy logic—shapes the plot of  The Inspector General. As the play opens, the mayor of a remote town summons all the town’s officials, who are incompetent </p><p>人类倾向于将缺乏证据视为证据-这是阴谋逻辑的一个不可避免的特征-塑造了监察长的情节。当话剧开始时，一个偏远小镇的市长召见了镇上所有无能的官员。</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2020/11/19/gogol-incandescent-inanity/">https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2020/11/19/gogol-incandescent-inanity/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/抓住/">#抓住</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/inanity/">#inanity</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/果戈理/">#果戈理</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
