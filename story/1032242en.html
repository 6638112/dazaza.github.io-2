A kind of confusion melting into panic. He was exhausted, which he knew was making everything worse. It was about 1 a.m., and he&#39;d been at the wheel for almost 24 hours now, rocketing west at speeds well over 100 miles per hour. For lucky stretches, when the road opened up and Ashmore punched the throttle, he could get his silver Ford Mustang GT up to 159 mph—the car&#39;s top speed, he&#39;d discovered. Now, ahead of him in the inky-black night, he could see the flash of brake lights, a river of travelers funneling into a slow-moving line.</p><p>弗雷德·阿什莫尔(Fred Ashmore)正在加利福尼亚州尼德尔斯郊外干旱的低沙漠中，内华达州参差不齐的南点与亚利桑那州和加利福尼亚州的边界交界处，他感觉到它冲刷了他。一种困惑融化为恐慌。他筋疲力尽，他知道这会让一切变得更糟。那是凌晨1点左右，他已经开车将近24小时了，以超过每小时100英里的速度向西飞驰。对于幸运的路段，当道路畅通，阿什莫尔踩下油门时，他可以让他的银色福特野马GT达到每小时159英里-这是这辆车的最高时速，他发现。现在，在漆黑的夜色中，他可以看到刹车灯的闪光，一条旅行者的河流涌入一条缓慢移动的队伍中。</p><p>  Before long, Ashmore was inching along the desert highway, feeling crucial minutes tick by and craning to see what was ahead. That&#39;s when he noticed trunks popping open and a new fear took hold. Officials from the California Department of Food and Agriculture were searching vehicles entering the state. He watched a car in front of him stop and then get looked over from top to bottom.  If they do that to my car, Ashmore thought,  I&#39;m probably not getting it back.</p><p>没过多久，阿什莫尔就沿着沙漠高速公路缓缓前行，感觉关键的几分钟一分一秒地过去，伸长脖子想看看前方有什么。就在这时，他注意到后备箱突然打开，一种新的恐惧占据了上风。加州食品和农业部的官员正在搜查进入该州的车辆。他看着前面的一辆车停了下来，然后被人从上往下看。如果他们对我的车这样做，阿什莫尔想，我可能拿不回它了。</p><p>  On the outside, his Mustang looked pretty much like any other car on the road. Inside was another story. Splayed across Ashmore&#39;s dashboard was an array of devices, including a CB radio, a mounted tablet operating Waze and Google Maps, and an iPhone running a timer. Stuck to the inside of the windshield was a radar detector; on the front grille and back bumper were the sensors for a laser jammer. Even more conspicuously, strapped beside and behind Ashmore, where the front and rear passenger seats should have been, huge fuel tanks sloshed with gasoline. A series of hoses connected them—along with another enormous tank, this one in the trunk—to the car&#39;s main fuel tank. An officer inspecting Ashmore&#39;s rig could have been forgiven for concluding that he was driving a giant gasoline bomb.</p><p>从外观上看，他的野马看起来和路上的任何一辆车都没什么两样。里面是另一个故事。安石的仪表盘上散布着一系列设备，包括一台CB收音机，一台安装了Waze和Google地图的平板电脑，以及一台运行计时器的iPhone。挡风玻璃内侧贴着雷达探测器，前格栅和后保险杠上是激光干扰器的传感器。更引人注目的是，绑在阿什莫尔(Ashmore)旁边和后面的巨大油箱里满是汽油，这是前排和后排乘客座位本应放的地方。一系列软管将它们与后备箱中的另一个巨大的油箱连接到汽车的主燃料箱。一名检查安石钻机的警官得出结论说他驾驶的是一枚巨大的汽油弹，这是情有可原的。</p><p>  In fact, it was a vehicle customized for a single purpose: to complete the “Cannonball Run,” one of the great underground feats in American car culture—and to do it faster than anyone in history. Unofficial, unsanctioned, and spectacularly illegal, the Cannonball had been a staple of automotive lore for almost a half century before Ashmore&#39;s attempt late last spring. The rules are simple: Drivers start in Manhattan, at the Red Ball Garage on East 31st Street, and finish at the Portofino, a hotel in Redondo Beach, California. What happens in between is up to them. Not surprisingly, the race requires an almost astonishing—and endlessly creative—disregard for traffic laws.</p><p>事实上，这是一辆定制的汽车，目的只有一个：完成美国汽车文化中最伟大的地下壮举之一--“炮弹跑”--并且比历史上任何人都要快。非官方的，未经批准的，和惊人的非法，炮弹已经是汽车知识的主要近半个世纪之前，阿什莫尔的尝试去年春末。规则很简单：司机从曼哈顿出发，在东31街的红球车库(Red Ball Garage)开始，最后到达加利福尼亚州雷东多海滩(Redondo Beach)的波托菲诺(Portofino)酒店。中间会发生什么取决于他们。不足为奇的是，这场比赛需要几乎令人震惊的-而且是无休止的创造性-无视交通法。</p><p>  Over the decades, teams had been chipping away at the time needed to cover the 2,800 miles—cutting the record by nearly 10 hours since 1971, until it rested at 27 hours and 25 minutes. But among the clique of Cannonball devotees who kept tabs on the sport, a refrain of conventional wisdom had set in: The record could hardly fall much lower. There were simply too many cars on the road, and every innovation in engineering and technology—better fuel economy, more horsepower, the advent of digital navigation—seemed only to increase the problem. The Cannonball was bumping up against the limits of what was humanly possible.</p><p>几十年来，车队一直在逐步缩短完成2800英里所需的时间-自1971年以来将纪录缩短了近10个小时，直到停顿在27小时25分钟。但在密切关注这项运动的炮弹爱好者群体中，一种传统智慧的反响已经响起：纪录几乎不可能降得更低了。道路上的汽车实在太多了，工程和技术上的每一次创新-更好的燃油经济性，更大的马力，数字导航的出现-似乎都只会增加问题。炮弹正在撞向人类所能达到的极限。</p><p>  But earlier this year, that calculus changed. The arrival of the coronavirus and the lockdown that followed emptied America&#39;s roads like nothing had before. Traffic—the most confounding and unpredictable variable in any Cannonball run—was suddenly a virtual nonissue. The roads were clear, and as Americans hunkered down last spring, a contingent of Cannonball obsessives spotted a moment of rare opportunity. They saw what Fred Ashmore saw: The record was there for the taking.</p><p>但今年早些时候，这种微积分发生了变化。冠状病毒的到来和随之而来的封锁使美国的道路空无一人，这是前所未有的。交通-任何炮弹跑步中最令人困惑和不可预测的变量-突然变成了一个几乎不成问题的问题。道路畅通无阻，去年春天，当美国人蹲下身子时，一群炮弹痴迷者发现了一个难得的机会。他们看到了弗雷德·阿什莫尔(Fred Ashmore)所看到的：记录就在那里，等待索取。</p><p>  Now, as he idled in the darkness at the border checkpoint—with fewer than 300 miles to go—Ashmore could feel his shot at the record slipping away. Every second counted. When he set out, he knew that achieving the record would require a total average speed of nearly 110 mph—meaning that for every minute spent parked along the way, he would have to drive one minute at the impossible speed of 220 mph just to stay on target.</p><p>现在，当他在边境检查站的黑暗中无所事事时-还有不到300英里-阿什莫尔可以感觉到他创造纪录的机会正在溜走。每一秒都很重要。当他出发时，他知道要想达到纪录需要总的平均时速接近110英里-这意味着在沿途每停一分钟，他就必须以220英里的不可能速度行驶一分钟才能保持在目标位置。</p><p>  He&#39;d been awake for over a day—had barely even moved in his seat since exiting Oklahoma—and was feeling the claustrophobic dread of sleep deprivation. As he waited his turn in the slow-moving line, he imagined what was coming next: He was headed to jail, no doubt about it. But Ashmore had even prepared for that: He&#39;d packed cash for bail.</p><p>他已经醒了一天多了--自从离开俄克拉何马州后，他的座位几乎没有动过--感觉到了睡眠不足带来的幽闭恐惧症。当他在缓慢移动的队伍中等待轮到他的时候，他想象着接下来会发生什么：毫无疑问，他会被送进监狱。但阿什莫尔甚至已经为此做好了准备：他带着现金准备保释。</p><p> The officer tapped on the driver&#39;s side window and then noted the Texas plates on the Mustang. He asked what Ashmore&#39;s business was in California. “I just took a job here,” he replied. “I&#39;m moving.” Without so much as a second glance inside the vehicle, the officer adopted a perfunctory tone and rattled through a list of fruits and vegetables, asking if Ashmore was bringing any of them across the border. That&#39;s when Ashmore realized his worrying had been for naught. He was going to avoid a night in jail. In fact, he figured the speed record might still be possible. His half-hour delay had been costly, but as Ashmore was waved along, his fear gave way to an adrenalized sense of urgency. He hammered the throttle and the speedometer quickly topped out. The desert opened flat in front of him; he was desperate to make up for lost time.</p><p>警官轻敲司机的侧窗，然后注意到野马车上的德克萨斯车牌。他问安石在加州的业务是什么。“我刚在这里找了份工作，”他回答说。“我要搬家了。”这名警官甚至没有再看一眼车内，就采取了敷衍了事的语气，匆匆浏览了一份水果和蔬菜清单，询问安石是否将其中任何一种带过了边境。就在那时，阿什莫尔意识到他的担心是徒劳的。他要避免一夜牢狱之灾。事实上，他认为速度纪录仍有可能保持。他延误了半个小时，代价很高，但随着阿什莫尔被挥手示意，他的恐惧让位于一种激动人心的紧迫感。他猛击油门，时速表很快就满了。沙漠在他面前变得平坦，他拼命想把失去的时间补回来。</p><p>  The romance of the American road trip is rooted in a simple, time-honored notion: Only by driving—ideally slow, meandering driving—can we fully appreciate the vastness of this country. Fly overhead and you&#39;ll reach your destination more quickly, but you&#39;ll also miss everything in between. The Cannonball run flips that idea on its head, inviting us to see that even when experienced on four wheels, the country can be made to seem quite small, conquerable even—something you can wrap your arms around.</p><p>美国公路旅行的浪漫植根于一个简单而古老的概念：只有开车-理想的缓慢、蜿蜒行驶-才能充分欣赏这个国家的辽阔。从头顶飞过，你会更快到达目的地，但你也会错过中间的一切。炮弹长跑颠覆了这一想法，邀请我们看到，即使在四轮上经历过，这个国家也可以看起来相当小，甚至可以被征服-一些你可以拥抱的东西。</p><p> The Cannonball is the ultimate road trip, even as it jettisons the usual conventions of the road trip: There are no stops for photos, no detours to sample the World&#39;s Greatest Pancakes, no putting the top down to shout along to the radio as the wind whips by. These trips are thrillingly tactical, planned down to the minute—built, for instance, around traffic light cycles in Manhattan and peak usage times at rural gas stations. A competitor spends hours prepping with satellite maps and complex spreadsheets, constructing timetables that break the country into five-mile increments. All that work, designed to avoid spontaneity.</p><p>炮弹是终极的公路旅行，尽管它抛弃了通常的公路旅行惯例：没有停留拍照，没有绕道品尝世界上最棒的煎饼，没有放下顶部对着收音机大喊大叫。这些旅行是令人兴奋的战术，计划精确到分钟，例如，围绕曼哈顿的红绿灯周期和农村加油站的高峰使用时间。一位竞争对手花了几个小时准备卫星地图和复杂的电子表格，构建时间表，将这个国家分成五英里的增量。所有这些工作，都是为了避免自发性。</p><p> And yet it was a kind of spontaneity that birthed the race back in 1971, when a 37-year-old automotive journalist named Brock Yates set out from New York City, bound for Los Angeles. At the time that he conceived of the trip, the country was in the grips of a panic over automotive safety, sparked in part by the consumer advocate Ralph Nader and his famous book,  Unsafe at Any Speed. The alarm helped catalyze the creation of the Department of Transportation and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and prompted the passage of seat belt laws in dozens of states. A push for a national speed limit of 55 mph—justified on the grounds of both safety and fuel conservation—was gaining traction as well.</p><p>然而，1971年，37岁的汽车记者布罗克·耶茨(Brock Yates)从纽约市出发，前往洛杉矶，正是一种自发的行为催生了这场比赛。在他构思这次旅行的时候，这个国家正处于对汽车安全的恐慌之中，这在一定程度上是由消费者权益倡导者拉尔夫·纳德(Ralph Nader)和他的名著“任何速度都不安全”(Unsafe At Any Speed)引发的。这一警报帮助催化了交通部和国家公路交通安全管理局的成立，并促使数十个州通过了安全带法律。推动国家限速为每小时55英里-从安全和节约燃料的角度来看都是合理的-也得到了越来越多的支持。</p><p> Yates, a lifelong champion of civil disobedience and libertarian ideas, had a different vision of America&#39;s roads. Yates wanted to show that it was possible for Americans to drive safely at high speeds on the interstate, just as Germans did on the Autobahn. “Yes, make high-speed travel by car a reality!” Yates wrote. “Truth and justice affirmed by an overtly illegal act.”</p><p>耶茨是公民抗命和自由意志主义思想的终生捍卫者，他对美国的道路有着不同的看法。耶茨想要证明，美国人在州际公路上高速安全驾驶是可能的，就像德国人在高速公路上所做的那样。“是的，让驾车高速出行成为现实！”耶茨写道。“公开的非法行为所确认的真理和正义。”</p><p> Forty hours and 51 minutes after Yates—along with two friends and his 14-year-old son—set off, he reached Los Angeles. The nonstop drive was a test run for an audacious plan that Yates had hatched: a multicar race across America that would prove, once and for all, that capable drivers in capable cars could cross the country faster and more safely than anyone imagined. Or, as Yates put it: “a balls-out, shoot-the-moon, fuck-the-establishment rumble from New York to Los Angeles.” The starting point of the race would be the Red Ball Garage, on East 31st Street in Manhattan, where Yates&#39;s employer,  Car and Driver magazine, kept a test fleet of cars. The destination, the Portofino Inn, in Redondo Beach, California, was owned by a friend of Yates&#39;s. He called the race the Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash.</p><p>耶茨与两个朋友和他14岁的儿子出发40小时51分钟后，他到达了洛杉矶。这场不间断的驾驶是耶茨策划的一项大胆计划的试运行：一场横跨美国的多站比赛，将一劳永逸地证明，有能力的车手驾驶能干的汽车可以比任何人想象的更快、更安全地穿越美国。或者，就像耶茨所说的：“从纽约到洛杉矶，是一场狂轰滥炸、大肆抨击月球、操他妈的当权派的隆隆声。”比赛的起点将是曼哈顿东31街的红球车库(Red Ball Garage)，耶茨的雇主“汽车与司机”(Car&Driver)杂志在那里保留了一支测试车队。比赛的目的地是加利福尼亚州雷东多海滩的波托菲诺酒店，它的主人是耶茨的一位朋友。他把这场比赛命名为罐头球贝克海到闪耀海纪念杯冲刺比赛(Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash)。</p><p>  The name was an homage to Erwin “Cannon Ball” Baker, the father of American endurance racing and the holder, for almost 40 years, of the transcontinental record, with a time of 53 hours and 30 minutes. The inaugural Cannonball run was held six months after Yates&#39;s initial cross-country journey and featured eight teams and 23 participants. Among the entrants were a flight attendant, two restaurateurs, and a Union Oil public relations professional in a Travco Motor Home. Driving a Ferrari Daytona, Yates and his teammate, a professional racer named Dan Gurney, smashed Baker&#39;s record with a time of 35 hours and 54 minutes. When Yates&#39;s tongue-in-cheek chronicle of the race appeared in  Car and Driver, the event became a sensation.</p><p>这个名字是为了向美国耐力赛车之父欧文·贝克致敬，他以53小时30分钟的成绩保持了近40年的跨洲纪录。首届炮弹长跑是在耶茨最初的越野之旅六个月后举行的，共有8支队伍和23名参与者参加。参赛者中有一名空乘人员，两名餐馆老板，以及一名联合石油公司(Union Oil)的公关专业人士，他们坐在特拉斯科汽车之家(Travco Motor Home)。驾驶一辆法拉利代托纳，耶茨和他的队友，一位名叫丹·格尼的职业赛车手，以35小时54分钟的成绩打破了贝克的纪录。当耶茨对比赛的半开玩笑的编年史出现在“赛车和车手”上时，这一事件引起了轰动。</p><p>  But by 1979, the Cannonball was more carnival than competition, with teams masquerading as EMTs, off-duty cops, and even a crew of satellite tracking-and-recovery specialists. Though Yates seemed to relish the mayhem as much as anyone—he drove the fake ambulance, after all—he also got tired of it, and feared what it might produce. “I stopped the race, because I knew sooner or later that somebody was going to get killed,” he said years later. His disillusionment only increased when, in 1981, Burt Reynolds immortalized the race on film as a slapstick comedy. Critics savaged  The Cannonball Run. “The whole movie thing has never been a source of great pride for me,” Yates later wrote in  Car and Driver.</p><p>但到了1979年，炮弹比赛更像是嘉年华，而不是竞争，团队伪装成急救员、下班的警察，甚至还有一群卫星跟踪和回收专家。尽管耶茨似乎和任何人一样喜欢这场混乱-毕竟他开的是假救护车-但他也厌倦了</p><p> After Yates pulled the plug, the event began to peter out and the record setting went largely dormant. In 1983, a new record of 32 hours and seven minutes was set in a successor event called the U.S. Express, but after that, there were no verified attempts for nearly a quarter century. Of course, during that same period, the movie—much to Yates&#39;s consternation—became a cult hit, circulating among new generations of car enthusiasts like a relic of a lost time and indoctrinating scores of would-be Cannonballers into the gospel of speed. All they needed was for someone to make the first move.</p><p>在耶茨停止比赛后，这一事件开始逐渐消失，纪录创造在很大程度上处于休眠状态。1983年，被称为美国快车(U.S.Express)的后续赛事创造了32小时7分钟的新纪录，但在那之后，近四分之一个世纪没有经过验证的尝试。当然，在同一时期，这部让耶茨惊愕不已的电影成为狂热的热门影片，在新一代汽车爱好者中流传，就像一件逝去的时光的遗物，并向数十名想要成为炮弹手的人灌输速度的信条。他们所需要的就是有人迈出第一步。</p><p>  Among those infatuated by the Cannonball was Ed Bolian, a car-crazed teenager in suburban Atlanta. In 2004 he reached out to Yates, who was cordial but insistent: With the number of cars now on the road, not to mention the number of cops, it was impossible to beat the old records or to push beyond the 30-hour wall.</p><p>亚特兰大郊区的狂热少年埃德·博利安(Ed Bolian)就是那些痴迷于炮弹的人之一。2004年，他联系了热情但坚持的耶茨：以现在上路的汽车数量，更不用说警察的数量，要打破旧纪录或突破30小时的围墙是不可能的。</p><p> But the Cannonball wasn&#39;t dead yet. In May 2006 the event got a jolt of energy when Alex Roy, a rally driver, and Dave Maher, a Wall Street banker, drove a souped-up 2000 BMW M5 from the Red Ball Garage to the Santa Monica Pier in 31 hours and four minutes. Roy and Maher&#39;s run brought the race into the modern era—but it did very little to make the record seem attainable for an average car guy like Bolian. Roy&#39;s pursuit of the record had cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and was even aided by a rented spotter plane that flew ahead of him to look out for cops. In subsequent interviews, Roy described the run in daunting terms—you will fail, you will get arrested, you will die—perhaps in the hope of scaring off any would-be followers who might try for his new record.</p><p>但是炮弹还没有死。2006年5月，当拉力赛司机亚历克斯·罗伊(Alex Roy)和华尔街银行家戴夫·马赫(Dave Maher)驾驶一辆增压的2000 BMW M5从红球车库到圣莫尼卡码头(Santa Monica Pier)时，这一活动获得了能量的震动，用时31小时4分钟。罗伊和马赫的奔跑将比赛带入了现代--但对于像博利安这样的普通赛车手来说，这项纪录似乎是可以达到的。罗伊对这项记录的追逐已经花费了数十万美元，甚至还得到了一架租来的侦察机的帮助，这架侦察机在他前面飞行，以警惕警察。在随后的采访中，罗伊用令人望而生畏的语言描述了这次竞选-你会失败，你会被捕，你会死-也许是希望吓跑任何可能试图打破他的新纪录的潜在追随者。</p><p> Bolian was undeterred. He spent years breaking the Cannonball down into a series of subproblems that he could analyze and solve: traffic, timing, route, fuel consumption, and more. The pursuit of that singular goal carried him through his 20s, even as he struggled to find co-drivers and people to support him—or just to assure him that he wasn&#39;t crazy. The rush of attention brought by Roy&#39;s run had evaporated just as quickly as it arrived. As far as Bolian could tell, there was no one else out there who was even remotely interested in the Cannonball anymore.</p><p>博利安并没有被吓倒。他花了数年时间将炮弹分解成一系列他可以分析和解决的子问题：交通、时间、路线、油耗等等。对这一独特目标的追求使他度过了20多岁，尽管他努力寻找支持他的副驾驶和人-或者只是为了向他保证他没有疯。罗伊的奔跑带来的关注迅速消失，就像它到达的速度一样快。就博利安所知，再也没有人对炮弹感兴趣了。</p><p>  Eventually, Bolian was ready to take his shot. In 2013, after a decade of research and $45,000 in investment—“every penny I had”—he made a run in a modified 2004 Mercedes-Benz CL55 AMG. Along with his co-driver, Dave Black, and their navigator and lookout, Dan Huang, Bolian broke the record and the 30-hour mark, with a time of 28 hours and 50 minutes.</p><p>最终，博利安准备好了投篮。2013年，经过十年的研究和4.5万美元的投资-“我的每一分钱”-他试驾了一辆改装的2004款梅赛德斯-奔驰CL55AMG。与他的副驾驶戴夫·布莱克(Dave Black)以及他们的领航员和瞭望员黄丹(Dan Huang)一起，博利安以28小时50分钟的成绩打破了纪录和30小时大关。</p><p> Bolian had changed the game. “It was the attitude more than anything,” another Cannonballer told me. “ ‘We&#39;re going to go out and run this fast, and we might get arrested, but we&#39;re going to take that chance.’ No one had really done that before.” If they&#39;d been caught, Bolian and his team wouldn&#39;t just have received lots of expensive tickets. In many states there&#39;s a distinction between simple speeding infractions and the more egregious crimes of racing and recklessness, which carry the possibility of serious jail time. If all the counties that Bolian had sped through had decided to prosecute him—94 in total—he could have gone to jail for the rest of his life. “Everyone else had been going ticket speeds,” the Cannonballer said. “Ed was going ‘Arrest me now’ speeds.”</p><p>博利安改变了游戏规则。“态度比什么都重要，”另一名炮弹手告诉我。“‘我们要出去跑这么快，我们可能会被逮捕，但我们会冒这个险。’以前没有人真的这么做过。“。如果他们被抓到，博利安和他的团队不会只收到很多昂贵的门票。在许多州，简单的超速违规行为和更严重的赛车和鲁莽犯罪之间存在区别，这些罪行可能会导致严重的监禁。如果博利安经过的所有县都决定起诉他-总共94个-他可能会在监狱里度过余生。“其他每个人都在开罚单，”这位炮弹手说。“埃德打算以‘现在就逮捕我’的速度。”</p><p> As soon as word got out about Bolian&#39;s achievement, he was inundated with messages. He started a private Facebook group that grew to more than 50 members, all of them swapping notes, comparing cars, and prepping for runs of their own. “Anything I could do to find other crazy people like me and get them in the same room, I did,” Bolian told me. He&#39;s a lanky, affable, and unceasingly polite 35-year-old with a languorous Southern accent and a soothing baritone voice. In his free time, he teaches Sunday school. He also just happens to be the unofficial-but-official godfather, gatekeeper, and preserver of modern Cannonballing.</p><p>博利安成就的消息一传开，他就被信息淹没了。他在脸书上建立了一个私人小组，现在已经发展到50多名成员，所有人都在交换笔记，比较汽车，并为自己的跑步做准备。博利安告诉我：“我能做的任何事情都是为了找到其他像我一样的疯子，并把他们带到同一个房间里，我做到了。”他身材瘦长，和蔼可亲，35岁，总是彬彬有礼，带有一口慵懒的南方口音和一副令人舒缓的男中音。在空闲时间，他在主日学校教书。他也恰好是非官方但官方的教父，现代炮弹的守门人和保护者。</p><p>  Bolian organized events, hosted dinners at his own home, and founded an app called VINwiki with a corresponding YouTube channel that has become the most authoritative repository of modern Cannonball lore. When drivers are thinking of doing a Cannonball, they ask Bolian for advice; when they need an impartial timekeeper to track their progress across the country and verify their attempt, they send their data and evidence to Bolian.</p><p>博利安组织活动，在自己家里举办晚宴，并创建了一款名为VINwiki的应用程序，并拥有相应的YouTube频道，该频道已成为现代炮弹知识的最权威存储库。当司机们考虑打炮弹时，他们会征求博利安的意见；当他们需要一个公正的计时员来跟踪他们在全国各地的进度并验证他们的尝试时，他们会将数据和证据发送给博利安。</p><p> He knew that by fostering this small, strange community—“a fraternity of lunatics,” as Bolian called them—he was seeding the ground for his own eventual dethroning. For a kid who spent years thinking he was alone in his fervor for the Cannonball, the risk seemed worth it. “Not only was I a record holder,” he said, “but I cared much, much more about the history of it than anyone who had come before me.”</p><p>他知道，通过培育这个小而奇怪的群体--博利安称他们为“一群疯子兄弟会”--他正在为自己最终的下台播下种子。对于一个多年来一直认为自己是唯一一个对炮弹充满热情的孩子来说，冒险似乎是值得的。“我不仅是一个纪录保持者，”他说，“而且我比我之前的任何人都更关心它的历史。”</p><p> And people did try to take him down: Between 2013 and late 2019, there were dozens of well-planned, all-out attempts to claim the record. They all failed until November 2019, when drivers Doug Tabbutt and Arne Toman, with spotter Berkeley Chadwick, recorded a time of 27 hours and 25 minutes in a tricked-out 2015 Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG. The team&#39;s average speed was 103 mph; their top speed was 193.</p><p>人们确实试图扳倒他：从2013年到2019年末，有数十次精心策划的、全力以赴的尝试，试图夺取这一纪录。他们都失败了，直到2019年11月，车手道格·塔布特(Doug Tabbutt)和阿恩·托曼(Arne Toman)与观察员伯克利·查德威克(Berkeley Chadwick)一起，在一辆花哨的2015年梅赛德斯-奔驰E63 AMG上记录了27小时25分钟的时间。这支队伍的平均时速为103英里/小时；他们的最高时速为193英里/小时。</p><p> Now  that record, everyone figured, was truly unbeatable—until COVID-19 cleared the roads and set off a mad scramble to be the fastest of all time.</p><p>现在，每个人都认为，这个记录真的是无与伦比的-直到新冠肺炎清理了道路，掀起了一场疯狂的争夺历史上最快的比赛。</p><p>  Growing up in Downeast Maine in the early 1980s, Fred Ashmore discovered the Cannonball the same way many others did: He watched the movie when it came out on home video. For a long time he didn&#39;t even know the story was real. The family had only three TV channels, and in those days, Ashmore said, “if it wasn&#39;t in your local newspaper, it didn&#39;t exist.” Only years later, as a teen flipping through old copies of  Road &amp; Track magazine in the high school library, did he discover that people actually used to run the Cannonball. He was too late, he figured: The Cannonball was dead.</p><p>20世纪80年代初，弗雷德·阿什莫尔(Fred Ashmore)在缅因州下城长大，他和其他许多人一样，发现了炮弹：他在家庭视频中观看了这部电影。有很长一段时间，他甚至不知道这个故事是真的。这家人只有三个电视频道，在那些日子里，阿什莫尔说，“如果不是在你们当地的报纸上，它就不存在。”几年后，作为一个十几岁的青少年，在高中图书馆翻阅旧版的“公路与田径”杂志时，他才发现，人们实际上曾经经营过炮弹运动。他想，他来得太晚了：炮弹已经死了。</p><p> Throughout high school and college, Ashmore worked as a mechanic and spent his spare time racing anything he could find, like stock cars and drag racers. Nothing seemed to satisfy his automotive itch—not until he began pondering the notion of a cross-country run. Part of the attraction was cultural and nostalgic. “It&#39;s Americana, like driving Route 66,” Ashmore told me. But the race also offered the ultimate test of testosterone-fueled, speed-drenched lunacy—a chance to beat almost 50 years&#39; worth of other drivers.</p><p>在整个高中和大学期间，阿什莫尔都是一名机械师，业余时间把他能找到的任何东西都用来比赛，比如库存汽车和变速赛车手。似乎没有什么能满足他的汽车之痒-直到他开始考虑越野跑步的想法。吸引人的部分原因是文化和怀旧。“这是美国式的，就像在66号公路上行驶一样，”阿什莫尔告诉我。但这场比赛也提供了对睾丸素驱动、速度过快的精神错乱的终极考验-一个击败近50年其他车手的机会。</p><p> In 2014, after posting an ad on Facebook for a muscle car he&#39;d fixed up, Ashmore got to chatting with a New Zealander named Ben “Charlie Safari” Wilson and learned about an upcoming cross-country race requiring entrants to use only cars built before 1980 and purchased for less than $3,000. Ashmore was tired of racing around the same track against the same people night after night, and a coast-to-coast run seemed just crazy enough to try. He entered, had fun, and entered again in 2018 and 2019, setting speed records for the race on both runs. He eschewed most of the sophisticated technology that other cross-country racers embraced, like aircraft-collision-avoidance systems (to check for police planes overhead), thermal scopes, and military-style gyro-stabilized binoculars. He also avoided the more conventional performance enhancers that other competitors relied on to stay alert. “I&#39;ve never drank coffee in my life,” he said. He didn&#39;t listen to music. Instead he kept himself awake by doing math in his head: calculating his mileage per gallon, the distance to his next city, and his expected arrival time. He never had an accident or even a fender bender. Not until last year, when he was blindsided by a driver who, he says, ran a stop sign. He was unfazed. “Shit happens,” he told me. “I&#39;ve been very lucky. My number probably should&#39;ve been called before that.” But his car—a 1979 Mustang Cobra that he, his brother, and his dad had rebuilt by hand—was wrecked.</p><p>2014年，阿什莫尔在脸书上发布了一则他修理的肌肉车的广告后，与一位名叫本·“查理·萨法里”·威尔逊(Ben“Charlie Safari”Wilson)的新西兰人聊天，了解到即将举行的一场越野赛，要求参赛者只能使用1980年前制造、购买价格低于3000美元的汽车。阿什莫尔厌倦了夜以继日地绕着同一条赛道与相同的人比赛，从东海岸到西海岸的跑步似乎足够疯狂，以至于要尝试一下。他参赛，玩得很开心，并在2018年和2019年再次参赛，创造了两场比赛的速度纪录。他避开了其他越野赛车手接受的大多数复杂技术，比如飞机防撞系统(用于检查头顶上的警机)、热镜和军用陀螺稳定双筒望远镜。他还避免了其他竞争对手保持警惕所依赖的更传统的性能增强器。“我这辈子从未喝过咖啡，”他说。他没有听音乐。取而代之的是，他通过在脑子里做数学来保持清醒：计算每加仑汽油的里程数，到下一个城市的距离，以及他预计的到达时间。他从未出过车祸，甚至连挡泥板都没碰过。直到去年，他才被一名司机撞倒，他说，这名司机闯了停车标志。他无动于衷。“狗屎总会发生，”他告诉我。“我真的很幸运。我的电话号码可能在那之前就该打了。“。但他的车-一辆1979年的野马眼镜蛇(Mustang Cobra)，是他、他的兄弟和他的父亲手工修复的-被撞毁了。</p><p> Earlier this year, as the country went into lockdown, there wasn&#39;t much for Ashmore to do other than think about Cannonball. “COVID was weird,” he said. “Once the sun went down, there was nowhere to go.” He was biding his time in Oklahoma, where he&#39;d gone to help a friend clean up a recently acquired car collection, and spending his nights analyzing the new traffic patterns, watching traffic cams in New York City and Los Angeles, and toying with possible routes on Google Maps.</p><p>今年早些时候，随着这个国家进入封锁状态，阿什莫尔除了考虑炮弹之外，没有什么可做的。“COVID很奇怪，”他说。“太阳一落山，就无处可去了。”他在俄克拉何马州等待着自己的时间，他去那里帮助一位朋友清理最近获得的一批汽车，晚上分析新的交通模式，观看纽约市和洛杉矶的交通摄像头，并在谷歌地图上玩弄可能的路线。</p><p>  Ashmore knew that the sudden disappearance of most car traffic represented an obvious and enticing advantage. But in the earliest days of the pandemic, it wasn&#39;t clear that driving across the country was even possible—could you get into New York City or California? Maybe gas stations would be closed, or the Army would get called in to control traffic or close roads near COVID hot spots. Other Cannonballers were hunkered down across the country, wondering the same thing.  What if I&#39;m in the middle of Nebraska and they start shutting down state borders? The lockdown might be the perfect time to make a run—or maybe the worst.</p><p>阿什莫尔知道，大多数汽车流量的突然消失代表着一个明显而诱人的优势。但在大流行的最初几天，甚至不清楚驾车穿越全国是可能的-你能进入纽约市或加利福尼亚州吗？也许加油站会被关闭，或者军队会被叫来控制交通或关闭COVID热点附近的道路。全国各地的其他炮弹手都蹲在那里，想着同样的事情。如果我在内布拉斯加州中部，他们开始关闭州边界怎么办？封锁可能是逃跑的最佳时机-也可能是最糟糕的时机。</p><p>  Ashmore knew he wasn&#39;t alone in wondering if the global catastrophe was creating an unlikely opportunity. What he would soon discover, though, was that the lockdown was spawning a frenzy.</p><p>阿什莫尔知道，他并不是唯一想知道全球灾难是否正在创造一个不太可能的机会的人。然而，他很快就会发现，封锁正在引发一场狂热。</p><p> One of the drivers who toyed with making a run was Carl “Yumi” Dietz, who drove up to New York from South Carolina on April 3 and decided to give it a shot. Almost instantly he discovered that conditions were ideal. Manhattan had long been regarded as “the destroyer of Cannonball dreams,” as one race veteran put it: On a normal run in typical traffic, it can take more than an hour to get out of the city; under 20 minutes is considered lucky. Dietz set off from the Red Ball at 4 p.m., when New York is usually jammed with traffic, but the street</p><p>卡尔·迪茨(Carl Dietz)是其中一位玩弄跑步的司机，他于4月3日从南卡罗来纳州驱车前往纽约，并决定试一试。他几乎立刻发现条件很理想。长期以来，曼哈顿一直被认为是“炮弹梦的破坏者”，正如一位比赛老手所说：在正常的交通状况下，离开这座城市可能需要一个多小时；不到20分钟被认为是幸运的。Dietz在下午4点从红球出发，这个时候纽约通常交通拥堵，但街道。</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gq.com/story/the-great-cannonball-boom">https://www.gq.com/story/the-great-cannonball-boom</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/炮弹/">#炮弹</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
