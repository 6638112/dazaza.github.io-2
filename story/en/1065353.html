Described by the WHO as “resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed,” burnout is characterized by “feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion, increased mental distance from one’s job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one&#39;s job; and reduced professional efficacy.” But just as the early research on burnout showed it to be a fundamentally systemic problem—since the air traffic controllers being studied were extremely well-trained in coping with stress (many were military veterans)—more recent researchers also describe the causes of burnout as collective, and impossible for an individual to fix without a systems perspective.</p><p>在20世纪70年代早期，在空中交通管制的背景下，“倦怠”一词首次进入使用，经过人为错误沉淀的碰撞，与流量增加，人的人机界面较差的挫折以及普通的单调工作。由谁描述为“由尚未成功管理的慢性工作场所应力导致”，“倦怠以”能源消耗或疲惫的感觉为特征，从一个人的工作增加，或者与一个＆＃39相关的否定主义或玩世不恭的感觉;工作;并减少专业疗效。“但正如对倦怠的早期研究表明，它是一个从根本上的系统问题 - 由于正在研究的空中交通管制人士在应对压力（许多军事退伍军人）中受到极大良好训练的，因为最近的研究人员也描述了倦怠的原因集体，不可能在没有系统角度的情况下修复个人。</p><p> Factors like overwork or insufficient resources play a role in burnout, but according to Christina Maslach, of University of California, Berkeley, and Michael Leiter, at Saint Mary’s University, it’s at least as important to focus on fairness, transparency, and purpose in the workplace. Comparing workers to cucumbers in vinegar, Maslach said: “We should be trying to identify and analyze the critical components of ‘bad’ situations in which many good people function. Imagine investigating the personality of cucumbers to discover why they had turned into sour pickles without analyzing the vinegar barrels in which they had been submerged.”</p><p> 过度劳累或资源不足的因素在倦怠中发挥作用，但根据加利福尼亚大学克里斯蒂娜马斯拉赫，伯克利大学和迈克尔·莱蒂尔（Michael Leiter）的依据，它至少是关注公平，透明度和目的的重要性工作场所。将工人与醋中的黄瓜进行比较，Maslach表示：“我们应该试图识别和分析许多好人功能的”坏“情况的关键组成部分。想象一下，调查黄瓜的个性，发现他们为什么变成酸泡菜，而不分析它们被淹没的醋桶。“</p><p>  Burnout is undeniably costly. While individuals with full-blown cases can lose months and years of wages and carry the burden of expensive mental health interventions, more than half of all professionals fall somewhere on the burnout continuum. Burnout increases risk of coronary disease and type II diabetes, is associated with lower heart rate variability—generally understood to be indicative of reduced worse health and aging—and there have been studies of telomeres (protective caps at the end of chromosomes) that indicate telomere shortening usually associated with biological aging. Burnout has neurological implications, associated with thinning in the prefrontal cortex, larger amygdala, and smaller caudate, giving people less capacity for decision-making and implicating memory, attention, and emotion regulation. And beyond the physical implications of burnout, there are significant economic and social costs: Beyond the cost of treating burnout, research indicates severe consequences for burnout on relationships, especially our closest relationships. A partner of someone who burns out is at higher risk for burnout themselves, especially given compassion fatigue. Burnout costs organizations $120-190 billion a year, a rate comparable to cancer, at $172.8 billion in losses a year.</p><p>  倦怠是不可否认的。虽然具有全吹案件的个人可能会减少几个月和多年的工资，但携带昂贵的心理健康干预的负担，超过一半的专业人士落在倦怠连续统一体上。倦怠增加了冠状​​动脉疾病和II型糖尿病的风险，与较低的心率变异有关 - 通常理解为指示更差的健康和衰老，并且已经研究了端粒（染色体结束时的保护帽）的研究表明Telomete缩短通常与生物老化相关。 Burnout具有神经系统影响，与前额叶皮质稀疏，较大的Amygdala和更小的尾部相关，使人们能够减少决策和暗示记忆，关注和情感调节。除了倦怠的物理影响，还有显着的经济和社会成本：超出治疗倦怠的成本，研究表明倦怠对关系的严重后果，特别是我们最亲密的关系。燃烧的人的合作伙伴在倦怠本身的风险上升，特别是赋予慈悲疲劳。 Burnout成本组织每年120-1900亿美元，与癌症相比，每年亏损1728亿美元。</p><p> How can we stop blaming cucumbers for becoming pickles? How to mitigate the acidity in the environment? Individuals can’t yoga or meditate their way out of burnout. Indeed, heightening pressure on already-stressed individuals to “fix themselves” only perpetuates the cycles of stress. Organization-level interventions are needed.</p><p> 我们如何停止责备黄瓜以成为泡菜？如何减轻环境中的酸度？个人不能瑜伽或冥想出倦怠的方式。实际上，在已经强调的个人上提高压力“修复自己”只会延长压力的周期。需要组织级干预措施。</p><p>  If we can better understand what causes burnout, we can detect it before it unfolds into complete mental and physical collapse. This means learning how to recognize an early phase symptom like “workaholism” for what it is, before it blossoms into a crisis.</p><p>  如果我们能更好地了解倦怠的原因，我们可以在展开完全精神和物理崩溃之前检测到它。这意味着学习如何识别早期阶段症状，如“工作狂”，因为它是什么，因为它在危机中开花之前。</p><p>   Personal situations, such as the stress we experience, the support networks we have created for ourselves, or the type of job we are in</p><p>   个人情况，例如我们经历的压力，我们为自己创造的支持网络或我们所在的工作类型</p><p> Personal coping and regulation mechanisms, such as how well we are able to self-regulate our emotions and process them</p><p> 个人应对和监管机制，例如我们如何自我调节我们的情绪并处理它们 </p><p>  Underlying team structures, such as the size of the team, how they collaborate, and how they get things done</p><p>基础团队结构，如团队的大小，他们如何合作，以及他们如何完成完成</p><p> Atmosphere created within the team, such as the degree to which people communicate openly and are able to take risks</p><p> 团队中创建的氛围，例如人们公开沟通的程度，并且能够承担风险</p><p>  Level of transparency in the organization, such as how readily leadership shares salient information with employees</p><p>  组织中的透明度水平，例如随着领导者如何与员工分享突出的信息</p><p>  Wellness in the workplace is an $8 billion industry in the United States, and forward-thinking workplaces may think they are doing a great service by offering yoga, meditation classes, and other wellness services. But the research reveals that those efforts are not working. A 2019 Harvard Medical School  study published in the  Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) shows that workplace wellness programs had no impact on overall health, sleep quality, nutrition choices, health markers, or health care usage, failing to move the needle on the very issues that they claimed to redress. The programs also failed to improve basic workplace metrics such as absenteeism, performance quality, and retention of key employees.</p><p>  工作场所的健康是美国的80亿美元行业，前瞻性思维工作场所可以认为他们通过提供瑜伽，冥想课程和其他健康服务来做一项伟大的服务。但研究表明，这些努力不起作用。 2019年哈佛医学学习在美国医学协会（Jama）杂志上发表，表明，工作场所健康计划对整体健康，睡眠质量，营养选择，健康标记或医疗保健使用没有影响，未能移动针他们声称纠正的问题非常重要。这些计划还未能改善基本的工作场所指标，例如缺勤，性能质量和关键员工的保留。</p><p> The current spend on wellness is not fixing the problems it targets. So what can? First, we must broaden our definition of the term and better understand that burnout is not a yes or no (you have it or you don’t) condition.</p><p> 目前的健康花费不是解决它目标的问题。那么什么呢？首先，我们必须拓宽我们对术语的定义，更好地了解倦怠不是一个是或否（你拥有它或你没有）条件。</p><p>  With a broader view of what burnout is—less like an off/on switch and more like temperature-taking—we can begin to measure burnout. As the saying goes: “If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.”</p><p>  在更广泛的观点方面，就像关闭/在开关一样，更像温度的温度 - 我们可以开始衡量倦怠。俗话说：“如果你无法衡量它，你就无法改善它。”</p><p>  Burnout is not binary. Most believe that one has the condition or does not have it. Yet it is actually a spectrum and one that starts with seemingly harmless symptoms.</p><p>  倦怠不是二进制的。大多数人认为一个人有条件或没有它。然而，它实际上是一种频谱，一个以看似无害的症状开头。 </p><p> Burnout is distinct from depression and anxiety. Although it has some overlapping symptoms, it definitely manifests differently and is often caused by a broader set of environmental factors.</p><p>倦怠与抑郁和焦虑不同。虽然它具有一些重叠的症状，但它绝对表现出不同，并且通常由更广泛的环境因素引起。</p><p> Burnout should not be conflated with compassion fatigue. Compassion fatigue is a specific subset of burnout—associated with medical professionals, teachers, and social workers—which relates to the diminishment of empathic response over time. But it’s a misnomer in the sense that compassion does not become depleted whereas empathy does. Compassion activates the reward response in the brain, but empathy fires the pain response, mirroring the pain of the person being supported. Burnout is primarily a response to job demands, fairness, transparency, and other issues beyond responding to pain over time.</p><p> 倦怠不应该与同情疲劳混淆。同情疲劳是与医疗专业人员，教师和社会工作者相关的特定倦怠的子集 - 这与随着时间的推移逐渐减少。但是，这种意义上的意思是一个错误的人，而同情心会。同情激活大脑中的奖励响应，但同情触发疼痛反应，镜像被支持的人的痛苦。倦怠主要是对工作要求，公平性，透明度和其他问题的回应，而不是随着时间的推移响应疼痛。</p><p> There are various measures of burnout: the MBI (Maslach Burnout Inventory), the CBI (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory), and Freudenberger’s 12 stages of Burnout. But current measurement tools here are limited in three main ways:</p><p> 有各种倦怠措施：MBI（Maslach Burnout Inventory），CBI（哥本哈根倦怠库存），以及弗洛伊辛伯格的12个突发阶段。但这里的当前测量工具有三种主要方式有限：</p><p> They often confuse symptoms of burnout with risk factors of burnout, which is like equating someone having genetic predispositions to a condition with having it.</p><p> 他们经常将倦怠的症状与倦怠的危险因素混淆，这就像等同于将遗传易受遗传到具有它的状况的人。</p><p> They are designed to be measured at an individual level only, despite the fact that most causes of burnout are either outside an individual’s control or informed by their environment.</p><p> 它们旨在仅在个人级别衡量，尽管大多数倦怠的原因是个人的控制或其环境所通知。</p><p> They do not segue easily into action-taking, which is particularly problematic for a condition whose definition includes a lack of personal efficacy. Providing results without providing immediate assistance in action-taking is at best careless, and at worst irresponsible.</p><p> 它们不会轻易地采取行动，这对于一个定义缺乏个人疗效的条件特别有问题。提供结果而不提供行动的立即援助 - 以最大的粗心，并且在最糟糕的不负责任中。</p><p>  Early intervention offers the possibility to mitigate damage. While it takes an average of 14 months to two years to recover from full-blown burnout, catching burnout upstream in an earlier phase can reduce cost and length of interventions. To do this requires organizational awareness from leadership and managers, and requires regular collection of data at the individual, team, and aggregate levels of burnout.</p><p>  早期干预提供了减轻损坏的可能性。虽然从全面倦怠中恢复，但这平均持续14个月到两年，但在较早的阶段捕获上游的燃烧可以降低干预措施的成本和长度。为此需要来自领导和经理的组织意识，并且需要在个人，团队和总倦怠层面上定期收集数据。 </p><p> I argue for the imperative to create action-oriented, team-based diagnostics, since it is easy to miss burnout at the individual level. It’s hard, if not impossible, to self-assess because early stages of burnout masquerade as workaholism and believing you aren’t at risk is a risk factor. The causes of burnout are social, and its measurement should reflect that. It is critical to understand how clusters of people are faring with burnout in order to lead to interventions that work. Individual-level action-taking is hard because it’s hard to stay accountable and often stigmatizing. But change can be harnessed at the team level. By going to the team-level, you spread the responsibility out and make it easier to stay accountable. Team action-taking is also more nimble and can happen more quickly versus trying to change an entire organizational culture at once, which can be quite complicated.</p><p>我争辩旨在创建面向行动的团队的诊断，因为它很容易错过个人级别的倦怠。如果不是不可能的话，自我评估是难以置信的，因为倦怠伪装成作为工作狂和相信你的早期阶段没有风险是一种危险因素。倦怠的原因是社会，其测量应该反映出来。了解人们与倦怠的群集有多重要，以便导致干预措施。个人级别的行动是艰难的，因为它很难保持责任和经常侮辱。但是可以在团队层面利用变革。通过去团队级别，您将责任传播并使更容易保持责任。团队采取行动也更加灵活，而且试图立即改变整个组织文化，这可能更快地发生，这可能是非常复杂的。</p><p> A better diagnostic approach would ask questions at all three levels—individual, team, and organization—to understand both the cucumber and the vinegar it finds itself in:</p><p> 更好的诊断方法将在所有三个层面，团队和组织中提出问题 - 以了解它本身的黄瓜和醋：</p><p>   “Do you feel that reward systems in your organization are fair and transparent?”</p><p>   “你觉得组织中的奖励系统是否公平和透明？”</p><p> In case studies we’ve done with medium and large organizations, diagnostic tools have helped organizations determine where they are on a burnout spectrum and take effective actions: what gets measured can be improved.</p><p> 在我们使用中型组织进行的案例研究中，诊断工具已帮助组织确定它们在倦怠频谱上，并采取有效的行动：可以提高所测量的衡量标准。</p><p> With Entrepreneurs Organization we worked with a team of 150 people that completed full burnout and resilience diagnostics, which included 33 risk factors that contribute to burnout risk. We were able to extract the three major themes for the organization to focus on, and to sequence action-taking based on their scores and organizational needs. This burnout work will be embedded in their strategic planning at the highest levels for cultural change, benefit change decisions, and training budget decisions. In addition, each of their 11 teams received customized action-planning support based on their results which included: team coaching with highly qualified and trained coaches, and nudges that are customized to each team’s chosen course of action.</p><p> 通过企业家组织，我们与一支150人的团队合作，完成了完全倦怠和弹性诊断，其中包括33个危险因素，有助于倦怠风险。我们能够提取组织的三个主要主题，专注于，并根据其分数和组织需求进行排序。这项倦怠工作将在其战略规划中嵌入文化变革的最高水平，效益变革决策以及培训预算决定。此外，他们的11个团队中的每一个都根据其结果获得定制的行动计划支持，其中包括：团队教练与高素质和培训的教练，并对每个团队选择的行动方案定制的讽刺。</p><p> At Space Center Houston, we worked with a team of 50 who completed diagnostics to assess their burnout risk factors. In 2020, Houston has been specifically hit hard by both the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disaster damage caused by Hurricane Laura, so organizations in the area have been incredibly sensitive to burnout within their teams. The data from our diagnostic outlined patterns of risk factors that recurred across individual, team, and organizational level. The results of those will allow for more thoughtful decision-making around benefit, training and culture change decisions for the organization today and in the future.</p><p> 在Space Center休斯顿，我们与50名完成诊断的团队合作，以评估其倦怠风险因素。 2020年，休斯顿由劳拉飓风造成的Covid-19大流行和自然灾害损伤难以努力，因此该地区的组织对他们的团队中的倦怠令人难以置信。来自我们诊断概述的危险因素模式的数据，其在个人，团队和组织层面重复。这些结果将允许在今日和未来为本组织的福利，培训和文化改变决策的更加深思熟虑的决策。</p><p> There are also lighter lift entry points for getting started. For example, Stanford Hospital staff members were given a two-minute quiz (link  here) to better understand their resilience typologies as a group, helping them understand what might make them more or less at risk of burnout as an individual and as a team. They also got a snapshot of their motivational styles and coping strategies that set them up for conversations on how they could support one another more effectively.</p><p> 还有较轻的升力入口点，用于入门。例如，斯坦福医院的工作人员获得了两分钟的测验（在这里链接）以更好地了解他们的恢复力类型作为一个团体，帮助他们了解可能更为或更少的倦怠作为个人和团队的风险。他们还获得了他们的动机风格和应对策略的快照，即将其设为对话，了解如何更有效地相互支持。 </p><p>  While it may be frustrating to know that more meditation won’t necessarily save individuals from burnout, there  are organization-level strategies that companies can take up to safeguard their greatest resources, their people. Programs that are directed at individuals can have an impact, but only for about six months or so. But when the intervention targets the organization (e.g. task restructuring, evaluation changes, supervision shifts impacting job demand, and ability to influence decision-making) the impact lasted up to a year. When the personal and organizational are combined the impact is longer and stronger. But it is critical to realize that burnout work can’t be done as a one-off; it needs to be a constant effort over time.</p><p>虽然知道更多的冥想可能是令人沮丧的，但更多的冥想不一定从倦怠中拯救个人，但有组织级策略，公司可以努力努力维护他们最大的资源。针对个人的程序可能会产生影响，但只有大约六个月左右。但是当干预针对组织时（例如，任务重组，评估变更，监督变化影响工作需求，以及影响决策的能力）的影响持续了一年。当个人和组织的结合时，影响更长，更强大。但意识到倦怠工作无法作为一次性行为至关重要;随着时间的推移，它需要努力。</p><p> Examining Managerial Behavior.  Research shows that bad relationships with direct managers account for 75 percent of turnover. Too often, managers are incentivized to focus on short-term productivity metrics and are not trained to understand what is needed for sustainable individual and team performance. Extensive  research by the military on sustainable performance in stressful conditions teaches that leaders should become champions of health, rather than taskmasters that drive teams and organizations to burnout.</p><p> 检查管理行为。研究表明，与直接管理人员的不良关系占营业额的75％。经常经常，经理被激励专注于短期生产率指标，并没有接受培训，以了解可持续个人和团队绩效所需的内容。军方对压力条件的可持续业绩进行广泛的研究，教导领导人应该成为健康的冠军，而不是将团队和组织推向倦怠的TaskMasters。</p><p> Upholding Fairness and Transparency. There are some interesting pieces of  research on the fact that even monkeys value fairness. We are wired this way. As a result, when promotions are distributed unfairly, it contributes to burnout. This is especially true for groups that experience bias and microaggressions daily, who see themselves, and people who look like them, sidelined from advancement in the organization. People need coherence, purpose, and fairness to be healthy. Managers must understand that the behavior they model and the way they distribute work steers their team toward health or dysfunction and determines the ensuing human and organizational cost.</p><p> 秉承公平和透明度。甚至是猴子价值公平的事实有一些有趣的研究。我们以这种方式连接。因此，当促销不公平分布时，它有助于倦怠。对于每天经历偏见和微不足道的团体，这尤其如此，谁看到自己，以及那些看起来像他们的人，缺乏组织的进步。人们需要保持一致性，目的和公平性健康。管理人员必须了解他们模型的行为以及他们分配工作的方式使他们的团队能够实现健康或功能障碍，并确定随后的人力和组织成本。</p><p> The Role of Health Intrapreneurs. Health intrapreneurs are essentially educated champions (often self-designated) who take a leading role in building sustainable workplaces, a strategic component of their role and their company’s edge. Health intrapreneurs understand the interplay between the workplace and its impact on employee health and vice versa. From an organizational perspective, health intrapreneurs support engagement and retention, both key bottom line metrics across sectors. The steps toward becoming a powerful team health intrapreneur in an organization often include intrinsic interest in the subject, early adoption of best practices, and experimentation with ways to enlist employees in the vision of creating energizing workplaces. Intrapreneurs, or health champions, are leaders (often self-designated) who spark social innovation within their companies. They can affect change in an incredibly powerful way because they are close to the problem and can recruit agents of change such as managers and team leads into their efforts.</p><p> 卫生患者的作用。健康内部者基本上受过教育的冠军（通常是自我指定的），他在建立可持续工作场所，这是一个战略组成部分，他们的角色和公司优势的战略组成部分。健康内部者了解工作场所之间的相互作用及其对员工健康的影响，反之亦然。从组织的角度来看，健康的内肾上腺素支持接触和保留，跨部门的关键底线度量。在一个组织中成为一个强大的团队健康的步骤往往包括对该主题的内在兴趣，早期采用最佳做法，以及在创建激励工作场所愿景中征求员工的方法。内部官员或保健冠军是领导者（通常是自我指定的），他在公司内引发社会创新。他们可以以一种令人难以置信的强大的方式影响变革，因为它们接近问题，并且可以招募经理和团队的变化代理商，以其努力。</p><p> Focusing on the Four Pillars of Team Resilience. The four pillars are designed to instruct organizations on how they can begin to make lasting change at the cultural and organizational level, rather than putting the burden on individuals alone. These four keystone components are critical to moving toward a culture that’s more protected from burnout and its resulting churn. The four pillars of Team Resilience are:</p><p> 专注于团队弹性的四大支柱。这四个支柱旨在指导组织如何开始在文化和组织层面持久改变，而不是仅为个人施加负担。这四个基石组件对于朝着更受倦怠的文化而言，这四个梯形组件至关重要。团队恢复力的四大支柱是：</p><p> Self-Awareness. Teaching individuals to know their triggers, needs, and their sense of purpose. Ensuring that within teams there is enough vulnerability for people to share what they see as their purpose, strengths, and values is essential.</p><p> 自我意识。教人们知道他们的触发，需要和他们的目的感。确保在团队中有足够的脆弱性，让人们分享他们认为的目的，优势和价值观至关重要。</p><p> Autonomy. Team members must have an appropriate balance of autonomy and support in the work they do.</p><p> 自治。团队成员必须在他们所做的工作中具有适当的自主权和支持。 </p><p> Structured R&amp;R. The team needs guard-rails on intensity and quantity of work. Managers need to ensure workloads are evenly distributed, and that time for rest is protected and even encouraged.</p><p>结构化R＆amp; r。该团队需要守卫导轨的强度和工作量。管理人员需要确保工作负载均匀分布，并且休息的时间受到保护，甚至鼓励。</p><p> Community. For burnout to be truly guarded against, team members need to feel a sense of community, collaboration, loyalty, tolerance, and psychological safety.</p><p> 社区。对于倦怠来真正守卫，团队成员需要感受到社区，合作，忠诚，宽容和心理安全的感觉。</p><p>  The ubiquity of toxic organizations can and must end. We are in the right moment of history to make major changes to what we expect from organizations, even as COVID-19 is redefining the barriers of the home and work. We have massive, irrefutable data that catalogues the downside of ignoring workplace health, including the organizational costs and the ensuing human misery.</p><p>  毒性组织的无处不能，必须结束。我们正处于历史的正确时刻，为我们对组织的预期进行了重大变化，即使Covid-19正在重新定义家庭和工作的障碍。我们有大规模的，无可辩驳的数据，目录忽略了工作场所健康的缺点，包括组织成本和随后的人类痛苦。</p><p> Too often, the onus for well-being is placed onto the individual for issues that are, by their nature, systems-level issues and often occurring at the team level as well. Until we reframe the conversation, we can’t make critical changes to workplace culture and team structure, and the very real human pain and economic damage that burnout leaves in its wake will continue to proliferate. We need a wellness 2.0 approach that takes into account the implications for individuals, teams, and systems. It is time for a complete overhaul of how we understand workplace health based on research and data.
