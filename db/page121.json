Specifically, 21 cats belonging to 2 breeds (Maine Coon and European Shorthair) have been repeatedly exposed to three different stimuli that were expected to induce the emission of meows:\n Brushing - Cats were brushed by their owners in their home environment for a maximum of 5 minutes;\n  Isolation in an unfamiliar environment - Cats were transferred by their owners into an unfamiliar environment (e.g., a room in a different apartment or an office). Distance was minimized and the usual transportation routine was adopted so as to avoid discomfort to animals. The journey lasted less than 30 minutes and cats were allowed 30 minutes with their owners to recover from transportation, before being isolated in the unfamiliar environment, where they stayed alone for maximum 5 minutes;\n  Waiting for food - The owner started the routine operations that preceded food delivery in the usual environment the cat was familiar with. Food was given at most 5 minutes after the beginning of the experiment.\n The dataset has been produced and employed in the context of an interdepartmental project of the University of Milan (for further information, please refer to this  doi). The content of the dataset has been described in detail in a scientific work currently under review; the reference will be provided as soon as the paper is published.\n  Files containing meows are in the  dataset.zip archive. They are PCM streams (.wav). Naming conventions follow the pattern\u00a0C_NNNNN_BB_SS_OOOOO_RXX, which has to be exploded as follows:\n C = emission context (values: B =\u00a0brushing; F =\u00a0waiting for food; I: isolation in an unfamiliar environment);\n      SS = sex (values: FI = female, intact; FN: female, neutered; MI: male, intact; MN: male, neutered);\n  The  extra.zip\u00a0archive contains excluded recordings (sounds other than meows emitted by cats) and uncut sequences of close vocalizations.\n   The authors require to acknowledge their work and, in case of scientific publication,\u00a0to cite the most suitable reference among the following entries:\n Ntalampiras, S., Ludovico, L.A., Presti, G., Prato Previde, E., Battini, M., Cannas, S., Palestrini, C., Mattiello, S.: Automatic Classification of Cat Vocalizations Emitted in Different Contexts.

After the May 17, 2021 announcement of Siemens acquiring SupplyFrame (which include Hackaday and Tindie), we reached out to Siemens  via Twitter and email to interview the new owners at Siemens. Here are the questions we sent over. Special thanks to Noah at Siemens for getting these back over to us, and the electronics and engineering community. As a matter of disclosure, I started Hackaday and designed the logo/site design over 17 years ago, and had nothing to do with this sale in any way to SupplyFrame in 2013, or Siemens in 2021.\n Adafruit: SupplyFrame is a search/advertising and data company, it was purchased for $700m (reported), with the estimated 2021 revenue for SupplyFrame for 2021 of $70m \u2013 how does SupplyFrame and specifically findchips.com fit into Siemens? Where do Hackaday (the editorial site), hackaday.io (community projects/events), and Tindie fit?\n The Siemens  press release says the acquisition strengthens the Siemens portfolio through Software as a Service (SaaS) \u2013 not only in the field of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) and Printed Circuit Boards (PCB), but also scaling into other domains and technology fields. Can you tell us more about the vision for the Siemens portfolio? How do SupplyFrame and Avatar fit together, for example (Avatar being a recent acquisition as well).\n  Siemens\u2019 vision relative to this planned acquisition is clear: Supplyframe will be the nucleus, competence center and strategic core for future Siemens Digital Industries marketplace offerings. Acquiring Supplyframe provides Siemens with an outstanding opportunity to accelerate our marketplace vision and to complement and expand Siemens\u2019 ecosystem of digital services, software and platform offerings. Supplyframe\u2019s SaaS solutions are ideally positioned to bridge the chasm between manufacturer and supplier \u2013 the buy side and the supply side \u2013 resulting in cost optimization, increased agility, and highly informed decisions. And finally, Supplyframe offers Siemens the opportunity enhance a range of Siemens DI products.\n  Adafruit: For the businesses and events that SupplyFrame owned, will Siemens continue to hold Hackaday SuperCon? Will Siemens continue to develop and support Tindie? And will there be a Hackaday Prize in 2022 (and beyond)? How independent does Siemens intend to keep SupplyFrame from the rest of its operations? Will Tindie and Hackaday continue to be subsidiaries of SupplyFrame, or will they move under the Siemens umbrella? Who does Steve, the CEO of SupplyFrame, report to, Mike, the Editor at Hackaday?\n  Although it\u2019s too early to speak to many of the specifics of your question, we can tell you that our plans call for Supplyframe to remain a separate, standalone unit within Siemens Digital Industries Software under the continued leadership of Supplyframe\u2019s CEO Steve Flagg, who will report directly to Siemens Digital Industries Software\u2019s president and CEO Tony Hemmelgarn. And speaking more broadly, Siemens is committed to keeping the DNA of Supplyframe as an entrepreneurial entity. Over the past decade, Siemens has successfully integrated 40 acquisitions within Digital Industries Software, including the recent integration of Mendix (www.mendix.com), which has accelerated their growth and substantially improved their market position as they\u2019ve remained a separate organization and the intention with SupplyFrame is similar.\n  Adafruit: Hackaday.io hosts a variety of unusual projects. Will Siemens exert any content restrictions over independent creators there? Will Siemens provide staff to care for and manage the Hackaday community?\n    Adafruit: Under which data policies/privacy policies/terms of service will Hackaday and Tindie fall under after the acquisition is completed? Will there be any changes to what the users own and what Siemens owns?\n    Adafruit: This is primarily a question for the current staff since they may not know, or probably would want me to ask \u2013 Will Siemens do due diligence around equity in shares, salaries, and titles around roles at Supplyframe, Hackaday, and Tindie?\n  Until the deal closes it\u2019s too early to answer all the specifics of this question. But we can tell you that Siemens strongly believes that the people at Supplyframe are the main reason for Supplyframe\u2019s success; therefore, we are highly focused on retaining its world class employees.\n  Adafruit: Siemens has a new CEO as of February (Roland Busch). How does Roland perceive the hacker/maker community, especially compared to the traditional engineering industry Siemens has historically serviced?\n  Roland has been quite clear in his commitment to continuing Siemens\u2019 digital transformation, and to expanding Siemens to new segments and to reach new customers including makers. Siemens has invested over ten billion euros acquiring new software and has plans to continue with additional acquisitions. Acquisitions add value for Siemens and our customers and SupplyFrame is a prime example for such an acquisition.\n  Adafruit: Has any Siemens staff posted on Hackaday, a project on hackaday.io, purchased or sold something on Tindie?\n    Adafruit: Will the DesignLab space in Pasadena continue to host community events and residency programs?\n    Adafruit: Altium acquired Octopart and Ciiva, Mouser (owned by TTI) acquired CrowdSupply, Avnet acquired hackster.io and Dragon Innovation, Autodesk acquired Instructables, Upchain, and EAGLE, Newark is element14, so it appears there is a consolidation for electronic tools, community, and mind share\u2026 What other types of \u201cmaker\u201d type companies or technologies is Siemens looking for acquisition?\n    Adafruit: Seventeen years ago, I started Hackaday, the site, the mission, and designed the logo that is still in use today; please take good care of it \u2013 the SupplyFrame folks did a pretty good job.

G \n...... ", "note_en": "I am often asked in emails how to go about learning the necessary mathematics for getting a job in quantitative finance or data science if it isn&#39;t possible to head to university. This article is a response to such emails. I want to discuss how you can become a mathematical  autodidact using nothing but a range of relatively reasonably priced textbooks and resources on the internet. While it is far from easy to sustain the necessary effort to achieve such a task outside of a formal setting, it is possible with the resources (both paid and free) that are now available.\n  We&#39;ll begin by discussing the reasons for wanting to learn advanced mathematics, be it career-driven, to gain entrance into formal education or even as a hobby. We&#39;ll then outline the time commitment required for each stage of the process, from junior highschool (UK GCSE equivalent) through to postgraduate/research level work. I will then present the different study materials available for the equivalent of an undergraduate course, how to access them and how to make the best use of them. Finally, I will describe a mathematical syllabus that takes you all the way through a modern four-year Masters-level UK-style undergraduate course in mathematics, as applicable mainly to quantitative finance, data science or scientific software development.\n  In this particular article we will consider the first year of an undergraduate course. The remaining articles will each discuss subsequent years.\n    The first question to ask yourself is why you want to learn mathematics in the first place. It is an extremely serious undertaking and requires substantial long-term commitment over a number of years, so it is absolutely imperative that there is a strong underlying motivation, otherwise it is unlikely that you will stick with self-study over the long term.\n  For the majority of you on this site, it is because you wish to gain employment and/or further formal study in the field of quantitative finance, data science or scientific software development.\n  You might be an individual at the beginning of your educational career, deciding whether to take a formal university program in mathematics. You might have worked in a technical industry for 10-15 years, but seek a new role and wish to understand the necessary prerequisite material for the career change. You might also enjoy studying in your own time but lack a structured approach and want a reasonably linear path to follow.\n  One of the primary reasons for wanting to learn advanced mathematics is to become a &#34;quant&#34;. However, if your sole reason for wanting to learn these topics is to get a job in the sector, particularly in an investment bank or quantitative hedge fund, I would strongly advise you to carry out mathematics in a formal setting (i.e. at university). This is not because self-study will be any less valuable or teach you less than in a formal setting, but because the  credential from a  top university is, unfortunately, what often counts in getting interviews, at least for those early in their career.\n  An alternative reason for learning mathematics is because you wish to gain a deeper understanding of how the universe works. Mathematics is ultimately about formalising systems and understanding space, shape and structure. It is the &#34;language of nature&#34; and is utilised heavily in all of the quantitative sciences. It is also fascinating in its own right. If you are heavily interested in learning more about deeper areas of mathematics, but lack the ability to carry it out in a formal setting, this article series will help you gain the necessary mathematical maturity, if you are willing to put in the effort.\n    I want to emphasise that studying mathematics from the level of a junior highschooler to postgraduate level (if desired) will require a huge commitment in time, likely on the order of 10-15  years. Clearly this is a staggering commitment to undertake and, without a strong study-plan, will likely not be completed due to the simple fact that &#34;life often gets in the way&#34;.\n  However, chances are if you are considering studying advanced mathematics you will already have formal qualifications in the basics, particularly the mathematics learnt in junior and senior highschool (GCSE and A-Level for those of us in the UK!). In this instance it is likely that you might be able to begin learning at the start of the undergraduate level, or possibly at the level of an advanced highschool student.\n  Even if you have the equivalent qualifications in A-Level Mathematics or A-Level Further Mathematics, you will still have a long road ahead of you. I estimate that it will take approximately 3-4 years of full-time study or 6-8 years of part-time study, in order to have an equivalent knowledge base gained by an individual who has carried out formal study in a UK undergraduate mathematics program to masters level.\n  While I don&#39;t think it is necessary to have postgraduate qualifications to become a quant, it is useful and can certainly put you ahead of the competition. However, do not be put off by the time commitment for postgraduate study. It isn&#39;t absolutely necessary and is likely to be carried out in a formal, full-time setting regardless.\n  If you are happy with this overall level of commitment, then the broad path that you will follow should look something like this:\n    As you can see, a mathematics education to a high level can take anywhere from 3 years to approximately 15 years (or more!) depending on your chosen path. Hence this is not something to be undertaken lightly. You must give it serious consideration and make sure that the payoff (financial or otherwise) from study will be worth the serious effort required.\n    These days it is possible to study from a mixture of freely available video lectures, lecture notes and textbooks. There are those who learn better from watching videos and making notes, while others enjoy working methodically through a textbook. I&#39;ve listed what I consider to be the most useful resources below.\n    At the undergraduate level, I am a big fan of the  Springer Undergraduate Mathematics Series of textbooks, which cover pretty much every major course you will find on a  top-tier mathematics undergraduate degree in the UK. I will go into detail regarding choices of books for specific modules below.\n  I&#39;ve also found the  Schaum&#39;s Outlines series of books to be extremely helpful, particularly for those who like to learn by answering questions. While they don&#39;t go into the detail that others might (particularly the SUMS books above), they do help consolidate the basics by working through a lot of questions. I highly recommend them if you&#39;ve not seen any of the material before.\n    Many Universities provide publicly accessible course pages that contain freely available lecture notes, often in PDF format, typeset in LaTeX or similar. Where appropriate, I&#39;ve listed freely available lecture notes for particular courses. However, I prefer to recommend textbooks as they tend to cover a wider set of material. They aren&#39;t &#34;cherry picking&#34; material in a way that a lecturer will have to do so in order to fit the material into semester-length courses. Despite this issue, there are some extremely good lecture notes available online.\n    The rise of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) has fundamentally changed the way students now interact with lecturers, whether they are enrolled on a particular course or not. Leaders in the field include  MIT Open Courseware,  Coursera and  Udacity. Some MOOCs are free, while others charge. On the whole, I&#39;ve found MOOCs to be a great mechanism for learning as they are similar to how students learn at University, in a lecture setting.\n  They provide the added benefits of being able to pause videos, rewind them, interaction with lecturers on online portals as well as easy access to supplementary materials. Some have suggested that the quality of MOOCs is not as good as that which can be found in a University setting, but I disagree with this. On the whole, most MOOCs are actually  lectures filmed in University settings, so I feel this point is somewhat moot.\n  There are some extremely good MOOCs available in data science, machine learning and quantitative finance. However, I have found there to be a lack of more fundamental courses and as such you&#39;ll see me recommending textbooks for the majority of the courses listed here. As the focus turns to quantiative finance (in Year 3 and 4, as well as at the MFE level), I will be able to recommend more MOOCs in addition to traditional textbooks.\n    At this stage of your mathematical career you will be familiar with the basics of differential and integral calculus, trigonometric identities, perhaps some elementary linear algebra and possibly some elementary group theory, gained from highschool or through self-study.\n  However, there is a substantial shift in mindset when moving from A-Level/highschool mathematics to that studied in a typical UK undergraduate program. The methods for teaching mathematics at highschool level are largely mechanical in nature and do not require a deep level of thinking. At University, mathematics becomes largely about formal systems of axioms and an emphasis on formal proofs.\n  This means that ones thinking is shifted from mechanical solution of problems, utilising a &#34;toolbox&#34; of techniques, towards deep thought about disparate areas of mathematics that can be linked in order to prove results. It is the fundamental difference between highschool mathematics and undergraduate mathematics.\n  In fact, it is this particular mode of thinking that makes mathematics such a highly sought after degree in the quantitative finance world.\n  Self-study of university level mathematics is not an easy task, by any means. It requires a substantial level of discipline and effort to not only make the cognitive shift into &#34;theorem and proof&#34; mathematics, but also to do this as a full autodidact.\n  For those of you who are unable or unwilling to carry out formal study in a university setting and wish to tackle a full syllabus of undergraduate mathematics, I have created a comprehensive study plan below to take you from high school level mathematics to the equivalent of a four-year Masters in Mathematics undergraduate course. I have presented it in a year-by-year, module-by-module format with plenty of further reference materials to study at your own pace.\n  Since a degree course is often tailored to the desires of the individual in the latter two years, I have created a syllabus which broadly reflects the topics that a prospective quant should know. However, you can obviously add your own choices for your own particular situation. To this end, I have made suggestions where appropriate.\n  This article will concentrate on Year 1 of a degree program, with subsequent articles each covering an entire year.\n    The first year in an undergraduate mathematics education is primarily about shifting your mindset from the &#34;mechanical&#34; approach taught at highschool/A-Level into the &#34;formal systems&#34; approach that is studied at university. Hence, there is a much more rigourous emphasis on  mathematical foundations, including formal descriptions of  sets,  maps/functions,  continuity and  symmetry, as well as  theorems and  proofs.\n  The courses found in a first year largely reflect this transition, whereby the following core topics are emphasised:\n          Most  top-tier UK undergraduate courses have a &#34;Foundations&#34; module of some description. The goal of the course is to provide you with a detailed overview of the nature of university mathematics, including the notions of proof (such as  proof by induction and  proof by contradiction), the concept of a  map or  function, as well as the differing types such as the  injection,  surjection and  bijection.\n  In addition to these topics, the concept of a  set is formally outlined, as well as the induced structure on such sets by  operations, leading to the concept of  groups. These core topics and ideas will prepare you for the deeper topics of analysis, linear algebra and differential equations that form the remainder of a first year undergraduate syllabus.\n  Self-study of mathematical foundations can be challenging, as it is often the first time you will have seen the concept of a proof. It can be bewildering at the beginning to understand how proofs can be constructed, but as with everything else in life, it is possible to learn how to structure proofs through a lot of reading and practice.\n  Perhaps the best way to learn mathematical foundations is through &#34;bedside reading&#34;, or perhaps more rigourous study, of some of the better known textbooks. I myself learnt from the following two books listed under  Study Materials below. I can highly recommend them as they certainly provide a good taste as to what university mathematics is all about.\n        Real Analysis is a staple course in first year undergraduate mathematics. It is an extremely important topic, especially for quants, as it forms the basis for later courses in stochastic calculus and partial differential equations. The subject is primarily about  real numbers and functions between sets of real numbers. The main topics discussed include  sequences,  series,  convergence,  limits,  calculus and  continuity.\n  The primary benefit of studying real analysis is that it provides a gentle introduction to proofs, using examples that aren&#39;t too unfamiliar from A-Level (highschool equivalent) mathematics. In this way, real analysis courses teach not only the &#34;mindset&#34; of forming proofs, but also introduce more abstract concepts such as &#34;proper&#34; definitions of  infinity,  axioms (such as the  axiom of completeness) and some good experience manipulating  continuous functions and their  derivatives.\n  In order to learn Real Analysis by yourself, I would suggest taking a look at the textbook  Numbers and Functions: Steps into Analysis \r listed below. I used this to learn Real Analysis when I was at university and I found it extremely helpful. The book teaches you by getting you to carry out a large number of questions, rather than throwing a huge amount of text at you. In this way you  learn by doing. In addition to that book, I have listed a few others that are helpful. Finally, I&#39;ve listed a  YouTube playlist series from Harvey Mudd College, by Professor Francis Su. The video quality is not great, but the content is extremely good.\n        Linear Algebra is one of the most important, if not the most important, subjects to learn for a prospective quant or data scientist.\n  In an abstract sense Linear Algebra is about the study of  linear maps between  vector spaces. It teaches us that in certain cases linear maps and  matrices are actually equivalent. This latter result makes it extremely useful when dealing with matrix equations, of which there are many within quantitative finance and data science.\n  The majority of  statistical machine learning methods are based on the principles of linear algebra and calculus, as are many quantitative finance theories, such as the  covariance matrix and the  capital asset pricing model. Hence, it is imperative for prospective quants to learn it well.\n  Thankfully, Linear Algebra has such a wide applicability in mathematics, physics, engineering and science in general, that there are many great resources available for learning it. One of the best books to learn about it is by  Gilbert Strang, a professor at MIT. In addition to his textbook, you can also find a set of video lectures presented by him on MIT Open Courseware.\n        The subject of differential equations permeates wide areas of quantitative finance. They are an extremely important subject for a prospective quant to learn, as stochastic differential equations play a large part in options pricing theory.\n  Formally, a differential equation is a relationship between a function and its derivatives. Informally, they are equations, which describe how rates of change of the function, with respect to some other quantity, affect the function itself.\n  Ordinary differential equations (ODE) are the first type considered at university (as well as A-Level/Highschool). An ODE is a differential equation where the underlying function has one independent variable. For instance, an ODE could represent the  rate of change of population growth as a function of the population level itself.\n  As a quant, it is necessary to understand the basics of ODEs and how to solve them. Since the more complicated partial differential equations (PDE) and stochastic differential, equations (SDE) are widely found in quantitative analysis and trading, understanding the solution of the more simpler ODEs helps with understanding solutions of these problems.\n  Some ODEs can be solved  analytically, that is, with a closed-form solution, using elementary functions. However, the solution to many ODEs can only be written as a series or integral relationship. ODEs can be solved &#34;numerically&#34;, on the computer, using approximate methods. A large part of quantitative finance involves numerically solving differential equations in this manner.\n  There is no lack of study materials available for ODEs as they are a staple of the first year undergraduate mathematics program. I used the book written by my lecturer at University, and I found it to be approachable for a first year undergraduate (see Robinson, below). In addition, there is the famous &#34;Boyce &amp; DiPrima&#34; (now in its 10th edition!), which is the staple of many ODE courses. In addition there is a free video lecture series on MIT Open CourseWare:\n    Textbook/~$150 (although you&#39;ll get it much cheaper second-hand) -  Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems  by William Boyce and Richard DiPrima\n    Geometry is one of the most fundamental areas of mathematics. It is absolutely essential for many areas of deeper mathematics, including those related to quantitative finance. Many undergraduate courses introduce Euclidean geometry to students in their first year, and it is also an appropriate place to start for the autodidact.\n  The primary setting is often Euclidean Geometry in three-dimensions, namely the geometry of &#34;everyday life&#34;. You will learn a lot about constructing proofs from studying geometry, particularly with regards to projective geometry in the plane and geometry of the sphere.\n  In highschool (or at GCSE!) students are often taught about triangular geometry, and an introductory university module in Geometry will formalise these concepts, ultimately with the idea of gaining practice understanding and writing geometric proofs.\n  Euclidean Geometry eventually leads on to more general geometries such as Spherical Geometry or Hyperbolic Geometry, where familiar results from Euclidean Geometry are shown not to hold. In addition, and perhaps more relevant to the quant, having a good understanding of trigonometry is essential for later courses such as Fourier Analysis, which plays a substantial role in signals analysis and time series analysis.\n    Geometry is a tricky subject to introduce as it is extremely broad and covers such a diverse area of mathematics. However, I have found the following book, part of the Springer Undergraduate Mathematics Series, to be very helpful:\n      Groups are one of the most important algebraic structures found in mathematics. They provide the basis for studying more complex structures such as rings, fields, vector spaces (which we mentioned above in Linear Algebra). They are also strongly related to the idea of mathematical symmetry.\n  While it might be considered that groups are more of a &#34;pure mathematics&#34; topic, and thus are less applied, this is actually not the case.

Life was rich until I tried to quit. This is the story of why I had to pay $300K to unshackle myself.\u00a0  There\u2019s surprisingly little coverage on this topic, maybe because nobody is incentivized to reveal the unsavory truth, or because VCs and founders get a lot more airtime.  Here\u2019s everything I wish I knew before I joined a startup. I hope it can save you from burning piles of money like I did.\u00a0 \u200d\n  For all the talk around \u201cdisruption\u201d, startups exert a surprising inertia over employees.   \u201cGolden handcuffs\u201d is most often used to describe the inertia experienced by big tech employees who make a ton of money and have a hard time leaving. It also applies to startup employees who make a ton of  paper gains and have a hard time coming up with  real money to keep them.\u00a0 \u200d\n  Working at a startup generally requires taking a salary cut. The deal is sweetened with equity \u2014 an ownership stake that can mint millions.   The most common equity vehicle is the stock option. It\u2019s the  option to  buy a certain # of shares at a set price, aka the strike price. That\u2019s right.  You don\u2019t own shares of the company, you own the right to  buy them.    There are two more catches:\n Options usually expire within 90 days of your leaving \u2014 so you have to either pay up or give them up\n If you pay up, you also owe taxes on your  paper gains \u2014 the difference between your strike price and the current valuation\n #2 is dangerous because your taxes grow with the valuation. Even if you have a cheap strike price, your tax burden can be multiples higher. In fact, your total bill can end up costing more than the startup has ever paid you in cash! Yes, it is actually possible to be net negative after devoting years of your life as an employee.   In my case, the price tag for my vested shares was $100K, but the tax bill will be another $200K. That\u2019s a ton of cash just to  keep the shares I worked for, with no guarantees that they will be worth real money.  \u200d\n  The financial defaults are terrible for startup employees, but they don\u2019t need to be this way. You can and should negotiate the fine print, where all the devils lie. Exceptions are never granted unless you ask. Especially true if you are a strong hire and/or the startup really needs to fill the position (which is more common than you think).   First order of business is the exercise window.  Instead of taking the punishing 90 day window, ask for 10 years. You can frame it like this: \u201cI believe in the potential of X and I\u2019m excited to take part in the upside. It\u2019s important that I can do that regardless of my cash position at a specific moment in time.\u201d  Best time to ask is before you sign the offer. This is when you have peak leverage, and if you make it the final sticking point, you\u2019re more likely to get it. To gain an upper hand, try to secure competing offers that have more favorable terms.\u00a0  Does negotiating make you look petty? No, if anything, it shows you\u2019ve done your homework.  Not negotiating terrible terms betrays your naivete \u2014 like me when I signed my offer.  Whatever you settle on, make sure to get it in writing. Many a verbal promise is broken when there\u2019s large sums of money at stake.   If you still wind up with a crazy bill, see if the next company you join is willing to pay your switching cost. I forgot to do this when  negotiating with Instagram, but it can work, especially with bigger companies. The downside is that if you need the new company to bail you out of your old one, you are at their mercy.\u00a0  More points you can negotiate for:\n RSUs instead of stock options: restricted stock units have a strike price of $0, but early-stage startups may not offer this\n Even if you don\u2019t get everything you want, you\u2019ll still develop a better understanding of how accessible your equity  really is. Sometimes a higher salary is better than heaps of \u201clife-changing\u201d stock options you can never afford.  One more escape valve that just came to my attention:  83b election. If you believe in the growth potential of your shares AND you expect to stay and vest, you can choose to pay taxes on your full grant upfront, rather than on your paper gains down the line. This may save you a lot on taxes, but also comes with a dose of downsides:\n You can end up worse off if the shares decline in value OR you don\u2019t fully vest  \u200d\n  As much as startups talk about growing the pie, the finite pool of shares is treated as zero sum. There are only ever 100 points on a cap table. When you give up your options, they go back into the company pool. Your unused options can then be recycled to fund new employee packages.\u00a0\u00a0  Here&#39;s how a VC  sums it up: extending the exercise window prioritizes the well-being of former employees over existing ones. What startup in its right mind would do that?! Probably one that recognizes it was built, brick by brick, from the hands of early employees. Sadly,  91.4% do not recognize this.\u00a0  It\u2019s also hard to decipher the terms in your offer package. If every startup had to walk employees through how the numbers play out, a lot of offers would go unsigned because they\u2019re absurd. Instead, we&#39;re sold on the opportunity to \u201cmake a dent in the universe\u201d.   It\u2019s rarely about the money until the money becomes real.\u00a0 \u200d\n  Most people advised me to give up some shares, or find a third-party to front the cash and split the upside \u2014 both more rational choices than the one I took.\u00a0  In the end, watching years of hard work evaporate in 90 days far exceeded the pain of just paying for the damn lottery ticket. I\u2019m lucky I had access to that cash. Many people don\u2019t. They are forced to give up their shares or stay shackled to a company in hopes of liquidity some day.  I never joined a startup to get rich. But I did naively assume that if all went well, I would ride off into the sunset, having paid for the equity in sweat. I didn\u2019t comb through the fine print because I didn\u2019t know any better.\u00a0  Now you do! Maybe I should rebrand my $300K bill as a premium MBA \u2014 it\u2019s sure taught me a lot, and I hope it brings you a wealth of lessons too.  \u200d\n   I still believe the  right startup offers endless amounts of learning, and a serious shot at earning. But the pot of gold at the end of Unicorn Road is littered with hidden minefields.

I figured it would be a great read but at the same time, it&#39;s a useful exercise for me to see if there are any services we can get rid of or downgrade.\n Just to give you an idea of scale Prezly is an 18 person SaaS product. Fully bootstrapped (no outside capital) and serving about 500 customers globally.\n   If you break that down by the number of staff we&#39;re looking at a cost of 1250 \u20ac/month but this includes the server cost. Excluding server costs, the tooling per staff member (excluding hardware) is around  712  \u20ac/month\n  We&#39;re a software company so obviously, this is the main cost (outside of salaries). These are the minimal infrastructure we need to run the app.\n  Without any of those tools customers would start complaining. Only AWS, Sendgrid, Uploadcare and Algolia are mission-critical.

Carl Vinson aircraft carrier group, Carrier Strike Group One, in response to a massive build-up of Russian naval forces currently operating roughly 300 miles west of Hawaii.\n Multiple U.S. Defense officials speaking on background told\u00a0  The Debrief  that sailors assigned to the Carl Vinson Carrier Group found out at the end of May they would be leaving for an unscheduled deployment within the next 11 days. Reportedly, the carrier group had been previously scheduled to deploy at the end of the summer.\n Officials say the reason for the rapid deployment was large-scale movements by Russian naval forces seen heading towards the vicinity of Hawaii.\n \u201cDeployment cycles are typically very routine, highly coordinated, and scheduled well in advance,\u201d said one current Navy official who was not cleared to speak on the record. \u201cTo pull ahead of a previously scheduled deployment for a classified mission set is extremely rare.\u201d\n So far, the Navy and Department of Defense have not acknowledged the Carl Vinson Carrier Group\u2019s sudden quiet deployment. Instead, on June 17, U.S. Pacific Command released an\u00a0  article \u00a0simply announcing the group was currently in the Hawaiian Islands Operating Area. Framing its sudden appearance as \u201cintegrated training operations with the U.S. Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard.\u201d\n \u201cOperating in Hawaii provides unique opportunities for Vinson to train jointly while positioned to respond if called,\u201d Commander of the U.S. 3rd Fleet, Vice Adm. Steve Koehler, said cryptically, while avoiding mention of there being any real-world element to the group\u2019s activities. \u201cThey train to a variety of missions, from long-range strikes to anti-submarine warfare, and can move anywhere on the globe on short notice.\u201d\n   On June 13, Russian state-run media\u00a0  announced \u00a0Russia\u2019s Pacific Fleet would be conducting large-scale naval drills in the Pacific Ocean.\n According to Russian news outlet\u00a0  TASS , exercises include all of Russia\u2019s \u201cPrimorye Flotilla\u201d (Pacific Fleet), auxiliary vessels, and up to 20 aircraft, including long-range bombers. \u201cThe drills involve up to 20 surface combatants, submarines, and support vessels,\u201d specified the Russian Defense Ministry.\n CBS News   reports \u00a0that Russian officials call the maneuvers the \u201clargest exercise in the Pacific Ocean since the end of the Cold War.\u201d\n On Sunday, June 13, Three F-22 Raptors and a KC-135 refueling tanker were\u00a0  scrambled  from Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii. Initially, Air Force officials only said the scramble was an \u201cirregular patrol\u201d in response to a request by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA released a short message about the incident through Public Affairs spokesperson Ian Gregor, saying only, \u201cThe F.A.A. has a close working relationship with the military.\u201d\n Citing U.S. defense officials, CBS News   reports \u00a0the scrambling of the three stealth fighters and refueling aircraft were in response to Russian bombers that were picked up flying in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands. Reportedly, Russian bombers never entered the U.S.\u2019s Air Defense Identification Zone, and the F-22s did not intercept the aircraft.\n On May 26, several news outlets\u00a0  revealed \u00a0that a Russian Navy surveillance ship was seen lingering off the western coast of Hawaii. Believed to be the Vishnya-class signals intelligence ship the Kareliya (SSV-535), the spy vessel was reportedly set up 13 miles from the Hawaiian island of Kauai, roughly one nautical mile outside U.S. territorial waters.\n From its vantage point, the Russian spy vessel had a front-row seat to a failed air defense test by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency near Hawaii on May 27. According to reports, a pair of Standard Missile 6 Dual II (SM-6) air defense missiles failed to intercept a simulated ballistic missile attack during the test.\n Popular Mechanics Defense reporter, Kyle Mizokami,\u00a0  theorized \u00a0Russia might have been tipped off about the classified missile tests from Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and Notice to Mariners (NOMAR/HYDROPAC) warning aircraft or ships to avoid the area.\n Conversely, observation of the failed missile test may have been simply a bonus. The Kareliya- which specializes in intercepting and deciphering an adversary\u2019s transmissions \u2013 may have actually been trying to measure the U.S.\u2019s response to Russia\u2019s Pacific Fleet, which was currently heading towards the area.\n On Tuesday, CBS News   reported  that the U.S.S. Carl Vinson Carrier Group was \u201coperating about 200 miles east of Hawaii, conducting a strike group certification exercise.\u201d According to CBS, the certification exercise had been pre-planned but was moved closer to Hawaii in response to Russia\u2019s presence.\n Multiple defense officials tell\u00a0  The Debrief\u00a0 that planned exercises or deployment for the Carl Vinson Carrier Group had been previously scheduled for around September. These same officials said that in the last week of May, sailors were notified that plans to go underway had been moved up from months away to less than two weeks.\n   Defense officials tell\u00a0  The Debrief \u00a0that sailors assigned to Carrier Strike Group One reported to their ships on June 6. Live\u00a0  web cameras \u00a0of San Diego Harbor show the U.S.S. Carl Vinson left port around 10:30 am local time on June 7. Absent from its departure appears to be the usual fanfare. Namely \u201cmanning the rail\u201d or having the crew \u201cat quarters,\u201d with sailors lining up at regular intervals along the weather deck rails in ceremony as the ship enters or leaves port.\n Navy public affairs offices have declined to confirm, deny, or comment on the aircraft carrier group\u2019s deployment so far. After beginning with Naval Air Forces Command on June 10,  The Debrief\u2019s request made it up to 3rd Fleet Command\u2019s public affairs office on June 15.\n Instead of replying to media requests, on June 17, U.S. Pacific Fleet Command released a\u00a0  short article \u00a0and two images saying Carrier Strike Group One had arrived in the Hawaiian Islands Operating Area.\n Rather than acknowledging the atypical nature of the carrier group\u2019s arrival near Hawaii, Pacific Fleet Command\u2019s article seemed to be a veiled notice to Russian forces operating nearby that the U.S. Navy was prepared to respond to any aggression towards U.S. interests in the Pacific.\n The Navy mentioned that along with its flagship, the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Carl Vinson, the entire Carrier Strike Group One, which includes  \u2014 Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 2, Destroyer Squadron 1, the guided-missile destroyers U.S.S. O\u2019Kane (D.D.G. 77), U.S.S. Howard (D.D.G. 83), U.S.S. Chafee (D.D.G. 90), U.S.S. Dewey (DDG 105) and U.S.S. Michael Murphy (D.D.G. 11  \u2014 was all operating near Hawaii.\n   The Navy also reminded anyone who wasn\u2019t aware or had forgotten, the U.S.S. Carl Vinson is the first aircraft carrier equipped to support F-35C Lightning II and CMV-22B Osprey aircraft. Pointing out, the group also brought with it three U.S. Navy F/A-18 Strike Fighter Squadrons, and EA-18G Growler Electronic Attack Squadron, and E-2D Hawkeye Airborne Command &amp; Control Squadron, Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron, and Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron.\n \u201cWith its recent modifications, no other weapons platform has the responsiveness, endurance, multi-dimensional capacity, inherent battlespace awareness or command and control capabilities of CSG-1,\u201d reads the release by Pacific Fleet Command.\n CSG-1 isn\u2019t the only U.S. naval force that rapidly deployed to the Pacific in early June.\n As part of a training drill dubbed\u00a0  Exercise Agile Dagger , one-third of the Pacific Submarine Force deployed from Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam on June 3.\u00a0  According \u00a0to the Navy, submarines from Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; Bremerton, Washington; and San Diego, California; are participating in Exercise Agile Dagger to \u201cdeploy on short notice to demonstrate their readiness, agility, and lethality.\u201d\n There have been evident tensions between the United States and Russia in recent months. Russia has been accused of committing numerous cyber attacks against the U.S., and several months ago, Russia amassed 100,000 troops on the border with Western-allied Ukraine.\n However, there are no indications that any discussions regarding naval maneuvers in the Pacific came up during a meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin in Geneva on June 17.\n In a\u00a0  statement to CBS News , U.S. Indo-Pacific Command spokesperson, Captain Mike Kafka said, \u201cU.S. Indo-Pacific Command is monitoring the Russian vessels operating in international waters in the Western Pacific.\u201d\n Ultimately, why the Navy and DoD are so cagey about the Carl Vinson Carrier Group\u2019s sudden deployment or what is going on in the Pacific isn\u2019t entirely clear. It is, however, doubtful that things would ever escalate to the U.S. and Russia coming to blows.\n Nevertheless, with so many American and Russian naval forces currently operating in the vicinity of Hawaii, one defense official told\u00a0  The Debrief , \u201cThings could get pretty tense.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-19 08:21:47", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot",

\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters", "note_en": "John Carter has only an hour to decide. The most important auto race of the season is looming; it will be broadcast live on national television and could bring major prize money. If his team wins, it will get a sponsorship deal and a chance to start making some real profits for a change.\n There\u2019s just one problem. In seven of the past twenty-four races, the engine in the Carter Racing car has blown out. An engine failure live on TV will jeopardize sponsorships\u2014and the driver\u2019s life. But withdrawing has consequences, too. The wasted entry fee means finishing the season in debt, and the team won\u2019t be happy about the missed opportunity for glory. As Burns\u2019s First Law of Racing says, \u201cNobody ever won a race sitting in the pits.\u201d\n  One of the engine mechanics has a hunch about what\u2019s causing the blowouts. He thinks that the engine\u2019s head gasket might be breaking in cooler weather. To help Carter decide what to do, a graph is devised that shows the conditions during each of the blowouts: the outdoor temperature at the time of the race plotted against the number of breaks in the head gasket. The dots are scattered into a sort of crooked smile across a range of temperatures from about fifty-five degrees to seventy-five degrees.\n   The upcoming race is forecast to be especially cold, just forty degrees, well below anything the cars have experienced before. So: race or withdraw?\n This case study, based on real data, and devised by a pair of clever business professors, has been shown to students around the world for more than three decades. Most groups presented with the Carter Racing story look at the scattered dots on the graph and decide that the relationship between temperature and engine failure is inconclusive. Almost everyone chooses to race. Almost no one looks at that chart and asks to see the seventeen missing data points\u2014the data from those races which did not end in engine failure.\n   As soon as those points are added, however, the terrible risk of a cold race becomes clear. Every race in which the engine behaved properly was conducted when the temperature was higher than sixty-five degrees; every single attempt that occurred in temperatures at or below sixty-five degrees resulted in engine failure. Tomorrow\u2019s race would almost certainly end in catastrophe.\n  One more twist: the points on the graph are real but have nothing to do with auto racing. The first graph contains data compiled the evening before the disastrous launch of the space shuttle Challenger, in 1986. As Diane Vaughn relates in her account of the tragedy, \u201cThe Challenger Launch Decision\u201d (1996), the data were presented at an emergency   teleconference, scribbled by hand in a simple table format and hurriedly faxed to the Kennedy Space Center. Some engineers used the chart to argue that the shuttle\u2019s O-rings had malfunctioned in the cold before, and might again. But most of the experts were unconvinced. The chart implicitly defined the scope of relevance\u2014and nobody seems to have asked for additional data points, the ones they couldn\u2019t see. This is why the managers made the tragic decision to go ahead despite the weather. Soon after takeoff, the rubber O-rings leaked, a joint in the solid rocket boosters failed, and the space shuttle broke apart, killing all seven crew members. A decade later, Edward Tufte, the great maven of data visualization, used the Challenger teleconference as a potent example of the wrong way to display quantitative evidence. The right graph, he pointed out, would have shown the truth at a glance.\n In \u201cA History of Data Visualization and Graphic Communication\u201d (Harvard), Michael Friendly and Howard Wainer, a psychologist and a statistician, argue that visual thinking, by revealing what would otherwise remain invisible, has had a profound effect on the way we approach problems. The book begins with what might be the first statistical graph in history, devised by the Dutch cartographer Michael Florent van Langren in the sixteen-twenties. This was well into the Age of Discovery, and Europeans were concerned with the measurement of time, distance, and location. Such measurements were particularly important at sea, where accurate navigation presented a considerable challenge. Mariners had to rely on error-prone charts and faulty compasses; they made celestial observations while standing on the decks of rocking boats, and\u2014if all else failed\u2014threw rope overboard in an attempt to work out how far from the seabed they were. If establishing a north-south position was notoriously difficult, the spin of the Earth made it nearly impossible to accurately calculate a ship\u2019s east-west position.\n In 1628, van Langren wrote a letter to the Spanish court, in an effort to demonstrate the importance of improving the way longitude was calculated (and of giving him the funding to do so). To make his case, he drew a simple one-dimensional graph. On the left, he drew a tick mark, representing the ancient city of Toledo, in Spain. From this point, he drew a single horizontal line on the page, marking across its length twelve historical calculations of the longitudinal distance from Toledo to Rome. The estimates were wildly different, scattered all across the line. There was a cluster of estimates at around twenty degrees, including those made by the great astronomer Tycho Brahe and the pioneering cartographer Gerardus Mercator; others, including the celebrated mathematician Ptolemy, put the distance between the two cities closer to thirty degrees. All the estimates were too large\u2014we now know that the correct distance is sixteen and a half degrees. But the graph was meant to show just how divergent the estimates were. Depending on which one was used, a traveller from Toledo could end up anywhere between sixty miles outside Rome and more than six hundred miles away, on the plains of eastern Bulgaria.\n Van Langren could have put these values in a table, as would have been typical for the time, but, as Friendly and Wainer observe, \u201conly a graph speaks directly to the eyes.\u201d Once the numbers were visualized, the enormous differences among them\u2014and the stakes dependent on those differences\u2014became impossible to ignore. Van Langren wrote, \u201cIf the Longitude between Toledo and Rome is not known with certainty, consider, Your Highness, what it will be for the Western and Oriental Indies, that in comparison the former distance is almost nothing.\u201d\n  Van Langren\u2019s image marked an extraordinary conceptual leap. He was a skilled cartographer from a long line of cartographers, so he would have been familiar with depicting distances on a page. But, as Tufte puts it, in his classic study \u201cVisual Explanations\u201d (1997), \u201cMaps resemble miniature pictorial representations of the physical world.\u201d Here was something entirely new: encoding the estimate of a distance by its position along a line. Scientists were well versed in handling a range of values for a single property, but until then science had only ever been concerned with how to get rid of error\u2014how to take a collection of wrong answers and reduce its dimension to give a single, best answer. Van Langren was the first person to realize that a story lay in that dimension, one that could be physically seen on a page by abstracting it along a thin inked line.\n The originality of van Langren\u2019s graph attests to a long history of missed opportunities to arrive at the same idea. Friendly and Wainer offer an example from the banks of the Nile, which, before the Aswan Dam was built, in the nineteen-sixties, flooded each year. \u201cEgyptians, who knew that their prosperity depended on the river\u2019s annual overflow, had been keeping the Nile\u2019s high-water mark for more than three millennia,\u201d they write. The records helped farmers track the level of flooding in the recent past and decide when and where to plant crops. But, over thousands of years, nobody realized the significance of the data in aggregate\u2014until the nineteen-fifties, when William Popper used it to chart the Nile\u2019s flood levels in the course of thirteen centuries. Friendly and Wainer write, \u201cNo one thought to make a graph of the high-water level over time or compare the average water level in the last decade to what might occur in the next.\u201d Popper\u2019s work showed, for the first time, the surprisingly wide variation in silting across different periods\u2014and silting was an important factor in fertilizing crops. Fat years and lean years didn\u2019t just happen.\n It was another hundred and fifty years after van Langren\u2019s letter before the next significant advances in visualizing data arrived, courtesy of a 1786 book by the Scottish engineer William Playfair, \u201cThe Commercial and Political Atlas.\u201d Despite the title, it didn\u2019t contain a single conventional geographical map. Instead, it displayed Playfair\u2019s great ability to chart out the shape of an object that existed only in his mind, cementing his place in the history of data graphics: he gave us the line graph of a time series, the bar chart, and, eventually, the pie chart\u2014practically the entire suite of Excel charting options.\n  Playfair explained his approach using a graph that showed the expenditure of the Royal Navy over the preceding decades. Time is on the horizontal x-axis, money is on the vertical y-axis; the line wiggles up and down from left to right. With the advantage of a few centuries\u2019 worth of perspective, it\u2019s hard to believe that this kind of image would be anything other than intuitive to grasp. But Playfair, introducing the time-series graph to the world for the first time, had to work hard to get people to understand what they were seeing. He asked his readers to imagine that he had taken the money spent by the Navy in a single year and laid it out neatly, in guineas, in a straight column on a table. To the right, he would create another column of guineas, to correspond to the amount paid out in the following year. If he continued doing this, creating a column of guineas for each year, \u201cthey would make a shape, the dimensions of which would agree exactly with the amount of the sums.\u201d\n  Where van Langren had abstracted the range of longitudinal estimates into a line, Playfair had gone further. He discovered that you could encode time by its position on the page. This idea may have come naturally to him. Friendly and Wainer describe how, when Playfair was younger, his brother had explained one way to record the daily high temperatures over an extended period: he should imagine a bunch of thermometers in a row and record his temperature readings as if he were tracing the different mercury levels; from there, it was only a small step to let the image of the thermometer fade into the background, use a dot to represent the top of the column of mercury, and line up the dots from left to right on the page. By visualizing time on the x-axis, Playfair had created a tool for making pictures from numbers which offered a portal to a much deeper connection with time and distance. As the industrial age emerged, this proved to be a life-saving insight.\n Back when long-distance travel was provided by horse-drawn stagecoaches, departure timetables were suggestive rather than definitive. Where schedules did exist, they would often be listed alongside caveats, such as \u201cbarring accidents!\u201d or \u201cGod permitting!\u201d Once passenger railways started to open up, in the eighteen-twenties and thirties, train times would be advertised, but, without nationally agreed-on time and time zones, their punctuality fell well shy of modern standards. When George Hudson, the English tycoon known as the Railway King, was confronted with data showing how often his trains ran late, he countered with the data on how often his trains were early, and insisted that, in net terms, his railway ran roughly on time.\n As train travel became increasingly popular, patience was no longer the only casualty of this system: head-on collisions started to occur. With more lines and stations being added, rail operators needed a way to avoid accidents. A big breakthrough came from France, in an elegant new style of graph first demonstrated by the railway engineer Charles Ibry.\n  In a presentation to the French Minister of Public Works in 1847, Ibry displayed a chart that could show simultaneously the locations of all the trains between Paris and Le Havre in a twenty-four-hour period. Like Playfair, Ibry used the horizontal axis to denote the passing of time. Every millimetre across represented two minutes. In the top left corner was a mark to denote the Paris railway station, and then, down the vertical axis, each station was marked out along the route to Le Havre. They were positioned precisely according to distance, with one kilometre in the physical world corresponding to two and a half millimetres on the graph.\n With the axes set up in this way, the trains appeared on the graph as simple diagonal lines, sweeping from left to right as they travelled across distance and time. In the simplest sections of the rail network, with no junctions or crossings or stops, you could choose where to place the diagonal line of each train to insure that there was sufficient spacing around it. Things got complicated, however, if the trains weren\u2019t moving at the same speed. The faster the train, the steeper the line, so a passenger express train crossed quickly from top to bottom, while slower freight trains appeared as thin lines with a far shallower angle. The problem of scheduling became a matter of spacing a series of differently angled lines in a box so that they never unintentionally crossed on the page, and hence never met on the track.\n   These train graphs weren\u2019t meant to be illustrations\u2014they weren\u2019t designed to persuade or to provide conceptual insight. They were created as an instrument for solving the intricate complexities of timetabling, almost akin to a slide rule. Yet they also constituted a map of an abstract conceptual space, a place where, to paraphrase the statistician John Tukey, you were forced to notice what you otherwise wouldn\u2019t see.\n Within a decade, the graphs were being used to create train schedules across the world. Until recently, some transit departments still preferred to work by hand, rather than by computer, using lined paper and a pencil, angling the ruler more sharply to denote faster trains on the line. And contemporary train-planning software relies heavily on these very graphs, essentially unchanged since Ibry\u2019s day. In 2016, a team of data scientists was able to work out that a series of unexplained disruptions on Singapore\u2019s MRT Circle Line were caused by a single rogue train. Onboard, the train appeared to be operating normally, but as it passed other trains in the tunnels it would trigger their emergency brakes. The pattern could not be seen by sorting the data by trains, or by times, or by locations. Only when a version of Ibry\u2019s graph was used did the problem reveal itself.\n Until the nineteenth century, Friendly and Wainer tell us, most modern forms of data graphics\u2014pie charts, line graphs, and bar charts\u2014tended to have a one-dimensional view of their data. Playfair\u2019s line graph of Navy expenditures, for instance, was concerned only with how that one variable changed over time. But, as the nineteenth century progressed, graphs began to break free of their one-dimensional roots. The scatter plot, which some trace back to the English scientist John Herschel, and which Tufte heralds as \u201cthe greatest of all graphical designs,\u201d allowed statistical graphs to take on the form of two continuous variables at once\u2014temperature, or money, or unemployment rates, or wine consumption\u2014whether it had a real-world physical presence or not. Rather than featuring a single line joining single values as they move over time, these graphs could present clouds of points, each plotted according to two variables.\n Their appearance is instantly familiar. As Alberto Cairo puts it in his recent book, \u201cHow Charts Lie,\u201d scatter plots got their name for a reason: \u201cThey are intended to show the relative  scattering of the dots, their dispersion or concentration in different regions of the chart.\u201d Glancing at a scatter allows you to judge whether the data is trending in one direction or another, and to spot if there are clusters of similar dots that are hiding in the numbers.\n A famous example comes from around 1911, when the astronomers Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell independently produced a scatter of a series of stars, plotting their luminosity against their color, moving across the spectrum from blue to red. (A star\u2019s color is determined by its surface temperature; its luminosity, or intrinsic brightness, is determined both by its surface temperature and by its size.) The result, as Friendly and Wainer concede, is \u201cnot a graph of great beauty,\u201d but it did revolutionize astrophysics. The scatter plot showed that the stars were distributed not at random but concentrated in groups, huddled together by type. These clusters would prove to be home to the blue and red giants, and also the red and white dwarfs.\n In graphs like these, the distance between any two given dots on the page took on an entirely abstract meaning. It was no longer related to physical proximity; it now meant something more akin to similarity. Closeness within the conceptual space of the graph meant that two stars were alike in their characteristics. A surprising number of stars were, say, reddish and dim, because the red dwarf turned out to be a significant category of star; the way stars in this category clustered on the scatter plot showed that they were conceptually proximate, not that they were physically so.\n But if you could find clusters of dots in two dimensions, why not three? Friendly and Wainer discuss a three-dimensional scatter plot that improved our understanding of Type 2 diabetes. In 1979, two scientists, Gerald\u00a0M. Reaven and R.\u00a0G. Miller, plotted blood-glucose levels against the production of insulin in the pancreas for a series of patients. Along a third axis, they added a metric for how efficiently insulin is used by the body. What emerged was a three-dimensional structure that looks a little like an egg with floppy wings. It allowed Reaven and Miller to split participants into three groups\u2014those with overt diabetes, those with latent diabetes, and those who were unaffected\u2014and to understand how patients might transition from one state to another. Previously it had been thought that overt diabetes was preceded by the latent stage, but the graph showed that the only \u201cpath\u201d from one to the other was through the region occupied by those classified as normal. Because of this and evidence from other studies, they are now considered two separate disease classes.\n  If three dimensions are possible, though, why not four? Or four hundred? Today, much of data science is founded on precisely these high-dimensional spaces. They\u2019re dizzying to contemplate, but the fundamental principles are the same as those of their nineteenth-century scatter-plot predecessors. The axes could be the range of possible answers to a questionnaire on a dating Web site, with individuals floating as dots in a vast high-dimensional space, their positions fixed by the responses they gave when they signed up. In 2012, Chris McKinlay, a grad student in applied mathematics, worked out how to scrape data from OkCupid and used this strategy\u2014hunting for dots in a similar region, in the hope that proximity translated into romantic compatibility. (He says the eighty-eighth time was the charm.) Or the axes could relate to your reaction to a film on a streaming service, or the amount of time you spend looking at a particular post on a social-media site. Or they could relate to something physical, like the DNA in your cells: the genetic analysis used to infer our ancestry looks for variability and clusters within these abstract, conceptual spaces. There are subtle shifts in the codes for proteins sprinkled throughout our DNA; o\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-19 08:15:32", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u56fe\u8868,matter,\u706b\u8f66", "title": "\u5f53\u56fe\u8868\u662f\u751f\u6b7b\u6538\u5173\u7684\u65f6\u5019 ", "title_en": "When Graphs Are a Matter of Life and Death", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/06/21/when-graphs-are-a-matter-of-life-and-death", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u56fe\u8868", "matter", "\u706b\u8f66"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "2d1084e3509883115a8527e0864b7008.jpg", "infoid": 1066798, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\n\u4f46\u6211\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e1c\u897f - \u5728\u5a74\u513f\u9636\u6bb5 - \u662f\u8bd5\u56fe\u5c06\u6211\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u878d\u5165\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u54f2\u5b66\u3002 \u6211\u6b63\u8bd5\u56fe\u5f04\u6e05\u695a\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u6211\u7684\u6124\u6012\u548c\u6211\u7684\u60b2\u4f24\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f7f\u6211\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a - \u81f3\u5c11\u6709\u65f6 - \u5b83\u6b63\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002 \uff08\u5f3a\u5236\u6027\u5730\u558a\u9053\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\uff0c\u5965\u9edb\u5c14\u00b7\u8036\u548c\u534e\u548c\u827e\u8389\u68ee\u00b7\u6770\u52a0\u5173\u4e8eOuthaw\u60c5\u7eea\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\uff09Sally Hastlanger\u66fe\u7ecf\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\u76f8\u4fe1\u6211\u7684\u6124\u6012\u3002 \u8fd9\u662f\u4efb\u4f55\u4eba\u66fe\u7ecf\u7ed9\u6211\u7684\u6700\u597d\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002 \u6211\u6b63\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u5b66\u4e60\u5982\u4f55\u670d\u7528\u6124\u6012\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u7528\u4f5c\u7ee7\u7eed\u5199\u4f5c\u7684\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8003\u8651\u4f7f\u7528\u54f2\u5b66\u8bba\u8bc1\u7684\u601d\u60f3\u62b5\u5fa1\u73b0\u72b6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u5728\u538b\u5012\u6027\u548c\u6beb\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u67d0\u4e2a\u5730\u65b9\u3002 \u867d\u7136\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u7b4b\u75b2\u529b\u5c3d - \u4ee5\u4e00\u79cd\u5199\u4f5c\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bf4\uff0c\u6240\u8bf4\u7684\u5f62\u800c\u4e0a\u4e0d\u8fc7\u9760\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f - \u5b83\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6211\u6ca1\u6709\u9884\u671f\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u6df1\u611f\u548c\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u3002 ", "note_en": "Elizabeth Barnes is Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Virginia. She works in metaphysics, social and feminist philosophy, and ethics, and is especially interested in the the places where these subjects overlap. Right now she\u2019s finishing up a book on disability (The Minority Body) and thinking a lot about the metaphysics of social structure.\n I didn\u2019t expect to feel so angry. A few years ago, having established a certain amount of professional security, I decided to start doing more work on social and feminist philosophy \u2013 especially philosophical issues related to disability. I\u2019d always done some work on the topic, but I considered doing lots of work on it a professional luxury that had to be earned. When I began to focus more of my research on disability, I expected plenty of things \u2013 a deeper sense of fulfillment from what I was doing, a fair amount of side eye from colleagues, worries that the topic was too niche to be of general interest \u2013 but I didn\u2019t expect the emotional drain that the work would be. I feel angry \u2013 more than I could\u2019ve anticipated and more than I often care to admit \u2013 when I write about disability. And I also, at times, feel so, so sad.\n I have sat in philosophy seminars where it was asserted that I should be left to die on a desert island if the choice was between saving me and saving an arbitrary non-disabled person. I have been told it would be wrong for me to have my biological children because of my disability. I have been told that, while it isn\u2019t bad for me to exist, it would\u2019ve been better if my mother could\u2019ve had a non-disabled child instead. I\u2019ve even been told that it would\u2019ve been better, had she known, for my mother to have an abortion and try again in hopes of conceiving a non-disabled child. I have been told that it is obvious that my life is less valuable when compared to the lives of arbitrary non-disabled people. And these things weren\u2019t said as the conclusions of careful, extended argument. They were casual assertions. They were the kind of thing you skip over without pause because it\u2019s the uncontroversial part of your talk.\n Now, of course, no one has said these things to me specifically. They haven\u2019t said \u201cHey, Elizabeth Barnes, this is what we think about you!\u201d But they\u2019ve said them about disabled people in general, and I\u2019m a disabled person. Even just thinking about statements like these, as I write this, I feel so much \u2013 sadness, rage, and more than a little shame. It\u2019s an odd thing, a hard thing, to try to take these emotions and turn them into interesting philosophy and careful arguments. My first reaction isn\u2019t to sit down and come up with carefully crafted counterexamples for why the views I find so disgusting are false. My first reaction is to want to punch the people that say these things in the face. (Or maybe shut myself in my room and cry. Or maybe both. It depends on the day.) It\u2019s a strange thing \u2013 an almost unnatural thing \u2013 to construct careful, analytically rigorous arguments for the value of your own life, or for the bare intelligibility of the claims made by an entire civil rights movement.\n I\u2019m now putting the very finishing touches on a book on disability, though, so that strange and unnatural thing is more or less what I\u2019ve been doing for the last two years. My book is an attempt to show that the the kinds of things that often get said about disability within the Disability Rights Movement \u2013 that disability is a valuable part of human diversity, that disability is a social identity that disabled people should claim and be proud of, that many of the most significant harms of being disabled are social harms \u2013 have clear philosophical defenses and aren\u2019t nearly as counterintuitive as many philosophers seem to assume. Writing this book has been one of the most eye-opening professional experiences of my life. The beginning of the process was also the period in my life when I had to transition from being mostly invisibly disabled to being mostly visibly disabled. So the last two years have been an incredible learning curve, to say the least.\n One of the most difficult things I\u2019ve encountered is that, while I feel so angry and so sad about the subject matter, I have to work hard \u2013 especially now that I am visibly disabled \u2013 to not seem that way. A few ironic jokes are fine. But real anger and sadness? That has to be kept hidden away. And that\u2019s because one of the biggest challenges to having my work on disability taken seriously is the worry that I am too \u2018personally invested\u2019 in the topic. And seeming emotional can only amplify those worries. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think those worries are absurd. I am personally invested in the topic of disability. Of course I am. But the last time I checked, most non-disabled people are also rather personally invested in the topic. That is, non- disabled people are personally invested in being non-disabled just as much as I am personally invested in being disabled. Disability \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 is something everyone takes personally. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing, or something that impedes good philosophy. But the simple fact is that my work will be seen as personal in a way that Peter Singer\u2019s or Jeff McMahan\u2019s won\u2019t.\n The other pitfall in expressing emotion \u2013 especially negative emotions like anger or sadness \u2013 when talking about disability \u2013 again, especially if you are visibly disabled \u2013 is that people always misinterpret you, no matter how explicit you are. You are read as a \u2018bitter cripple\u2019 or a \u2018sad cripple\u2019. And of course you\u2019d be angry or sad \u2013 look at what happened to you! (Readers should please picture me rolling my eyes deeply at this point.) It\u2019s a surprisingly difficult thing \u2013 sometimes it\u2019s an impossible thing \u2013 to explain to people that you are not angry and sad about your disability, you are angry and sad about what is being said about your disability or how you are being treated because of your disability. You can say that as loud, as often, and as clearly as you want \u2013 people will still interpret your anger and sadness as the natural result of the bad luck you\u2019ve had in life. Again, hiding the anger and the sadness is the easier way to go.\n But what I\u2019ve been learning \u2013 in baby steps \u2013 is to try to channel my emotions into better philosophy. I\u2019m trying to figure out how to use my anger and my sadness as motivation to make my work better, and I think \u2013 at least sometimes \u2013 that it\u2019s working. (Obligatory shout-out here to Audre Lorde and Alison Jaggar on the value of outlaw emotions.) Sally Haslanger once told me to trust my anger. That was some of the best advice anyone\u2019s ever given me. I\u2019m trying to learn how to take my anger and use it as motivation to keep writing, especially on those days when the thought of using philosophical arguments to push back against the status quo feels somewhere between overwhelming and pointless.

...... ", "note_en": "The woman was to show up at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection office at 9 a.m. to view the document, and department officials weren\u2019t entirely sure what was going to happen from there. Two lawyers with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office would be present. An archivist specializing in historical artifacts had been brought in. Armed guards \u2014 four of them \u2014 would watch over the meeting to make sure that everything went over smoothly. No funny business. No sudden moves. Everyone figured this document viewing on May 25 near Denver International Airport would be an emotional one for the woman. She\u2019d already been sitting in her car in the parking lot outside, crying, since midnight, steeling herself for what was about to occur.\n In fact, Julia Turing had been rehearsing this moment for weeks, anticipating it for years.\n   In early 2018, federal agents had seized a number of historical artifacts from Julia\u2019s Conifer home that had originally belonged to British code breaker and computer science pioneer Alan Turing, the subject of  The Imitation Game,  a biopic starring Benedict Cumberbatch released in 2014. That\u2019s when most people learned about Turing. They learned about Julia in 2020, when the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office  filed a complaint that accused her of stealing Turing\u2019s belongings from a British boarding school during the 1980s. News outlets around the world ranging from the  Associated Press to the  BBC ran stories quoting the government\u2019s court filings about this strange Colorado woman who had devoted much of her life to an early-twentieth-century math genius, had purportedly taken some of his posthumous relics without permission, and had even changed her last name to match his in some kind of homage. What was behind Julia Turing\u2019s obsession? Derangement? A kind of fetish? Or something else?\n    In all the coverage, one thing was missing: Julia\u2019s own voice. Not until  Westword reached the 59-year-old via a P.O. box listed on some court documents did any media outlet obtain her side of the story.\n   In the late 1960s, the little brown-haired girl was finally enjoying a period of relative peace when her mother returned to pluck her off the front porch of her first foster home. Known then as Julie Ann Schwinghamer, the child had been cared for by a Native American family near Squaw Valley, California, after both of Julia\u2019s parents had abandoned her. Her father had left the family when Julia was three. Her mother had taken to the bottle, then Valium, all the while prone to violent outbursts.\n  In contrast, living with a foster family and running barefoot around the countryside was like a dream\u2026until Julia\u2019s mother came calling. Julia now says her mother had discovered that she could claim additional welfare with little Julia under her roof. And so her chaotic family life picked up where it had left off, this time in the regional farming hub of Dinuba, California. Fights and screaming matches, including with Julia\u2019s brother, were almost daily occurrences. Amid the chaos, Julia didn\u2019t learn to read or write, and the local elementary school held her back in second grade. She tried running away multiple times. Still, Julia had her momentary escapes, including the movies. And so on one hot summer afternoon, when Julia\u2019s mom wanted her out of the house, she went to the cinema on Dinuba\u2019s main street to see what was playing. The film was Stanley Kubrick\u2019s sci-fi classic,  2001: A Space Odyssey.\n \u201cI was really drawn into it,\u201d Julia recalls. \u201cAnd what disturbed me most was HAL 9000.\u201d\n She\u2019d never seen nor imagined anything like the talking computer in Kubrick\u2019s film, which infamously turns on its human masters once they\u2019ve left Earth\u2019s orbit. The image of HAL\u2019s unblinking red eye wore on her until Julia did something she\u2019d never done before: She went to the public library.\n Timidly, the girl asked the librarian, \u201cDo you have anything about machines that talk?\u201d\n The librarian was confused at first, until she placed a finger on what Julia was asking about.\n  She handed Julia a couple of books, but they weren\u2019t much use to a girl who couldn\u2019t read. After flipping through pages of dense text, Julia returned to the shelves to find something more visual. She hit paydirt with a bound volume containing pictures of early computers. The photographs mesmerized the child: all those beeping machines, some of them taking up entire rooms.\n But nothing prepared her for a photograph tucked away toward the back of the book. It wasn\u2019t of a machine, but of a man.  A man whom many historians regard as the pioneer of computer algorithms, the general-purpose computer, and a founding father of both theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.\n   \u201cThe moment I saw his face, it was like I knew him,\u201d Julia recalls. \u201cIt was an odd feeling of extreme familiarity.\u201d\n Taking the book home, she kept the volume open to the picture for the duration of her library loan. Then she checked it out again.\n When her mother caught sight of the book, she scoffed. \u201cWho is this?\u201d\n So began a lifetime of teasing and misunderstanding over Julia\u2019s reverence for Alan Turing. Julia just couldn\u2019t articulate it. How to explain that this image felt alive to her? Somehow, she was bound to Alan Turing.\n  \u201cMy thought was, is Alan Turing alive? Because I would like to meet him,\u201d she recalls.\n Julia\u2019s desire to know everything she could about Alan Turing propelled her to learn to read and write. That\u2019s when she discovered that the mathematician had died in 1954, and that his legacy extended far beyond computers. In fact, Turing had even been an accomplished marathon runner.\n Julia was inspired. Not only did she start excelling in school, but she followed Turing\u2019s footsteps into track and field. The quiet girl whose family had told her she\u2019d never amount to anything began to run. And run. And run.\n \u201cSoon I became the fastest runner in school,\u201d she says. \u201cMy teachers couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n  This run continued after Julia was put up for adoption and settled in with a foster family in Morro Bay, California. Going by the last name of Elliott (her step-father&#39;s name) in high school, Julia began breaking regional track records, even running an 11.5-second 100-meter dash, according to the May 15, 1980, edition of the  Sun-Bulletin newspaper.   She was propelled by a growing inspiration for Alan Turing. \u201cHe was my father figure, all the way up until I was nineteen,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThen it changed drastically from there.\u201d\n      Although Julia felt intimately connected to Turing, she was disturbed by how little she knew of his personal life. But she was hardly alone in that regard in the 1980s. Alan Turing remained relatively obscure until 2012,  when the British government declassified key documents that revealed the extent to which his code-breaking skills helped to undermine the Germans\u2019 enigma machine in World War Two, changing the course of the war and giving the Allies a significant advantage over their Nazi adversaries.\n  \u201cBut back then there was so little information about him, and I was hungry to learn more,\u201d Julia remembers. \u201cFor instance, I still didn\u2019t really understand the situation of how he died.\u201d\n For details like that, Julia had to dig deep. She tracked down books from England and sought primary source material. That\u2019s when she started learning that Turing had endured a tumultuous personal life of his own. It came to a head in 1952, when he was prosecuted for homosexual acts \u2014 then still a crime in the U.K. \u2014 after he had reported a petty burglary and had admitted to having a male lover in his house. After being found guilty of \u201cgross indecency,\u201d Turing was subjected to chemical castration. The English government forced him out of the secret service, and just weeks before his 42nd birthday, Turing was found dead at his home. An inquest found his death to be suicide by cyanide poisoning.\n But in 1984, Julia \u2014 then 22 years old \u2014 only knew some of these specifics. To find out more about Turing, she decided to make a trip to England. She used money that an insurance company had paid her following a car accident to buy her plane ticket.\n In England, Julia hit the ground running. She toured the universities where Turing had once walked the stone corridors, either as a student or a researcher. These included Oxford, Cambridge and King\u2019s College. At each school, she requested to view any archived material available on Turing, but archivists and librarians were suspicious. Who was this American lady, and why was she so interested in Turing? Julia remembers being disappointed that her access was so limited.\n  She was about to give up on school archives when she remembered one more institution that Turing had attended from 1926 to 1931, when he was a teenager: Sherborne School, a prestigious,  all-boys boarding school in Dorset.\n It was here that Julia finally got access to the types of artifacts she was looking for. Turing\u2019s mother had donated many items to the school between 1965 and 1967; they included things like Turing\u2019s school reports, photographs, medals (including Turing\u2019s OBE \u2014 Officer of the Order of the British Empire \u2014 which is similar to the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the U.S.) and school certificates, among them his Ph.D. diploma in mathematics from Princeton University.\n  Julia was amazed to find herself face to face with so many important items from Turing\u2019s life. These were things that he had held, had interacted with, had \u2014 even for a minute \u2014 contemplated and diverted some of his genius to. Julia felt Turing\u2019s presence like never before.\n Given Turing\u2019s obscurity at the time, it wasn\u2019t surprising that the Sherborne librarian told her that people rarely came to look at the Turing archive.\n  What happened next all those years ago is at the heart of the recent legal mess. While the librarian did not give Julia permission to take any items, Julia also spoke to the school\u2019s treasurer, Colonel A.W. Gallon.\n According to Julia, Gallon confirmed that visitors rarely came to see the Turing archive. She says that after she shared her troubled life story with Gallon, including how Turing was so inspirational to her, Gallon told her that she could take Turing\u2019s Ph.D. diploma, since it meant so much to her.\n  While there is no direct evidence to document Julia\u2019s version of this conversation, there\u2019s some evidence to suggest that Gallon later supported the idea that Julia could keep the Ph.D. But things get sticky from there, because Julia did steal from the school.\n Julia returned to Sherborne after her initial visit to view the items a second time. When the librarian left her side and she found herself alone, the librarian\u2019s comment about so few people caring to visit the Turing archive rang through her mind. Her heart raced as an irrepressible urge welled up.\n \u201cI made a mistake,\u201d Julia says. \u201cI was young. I felt that Alan Turing\u2019s things were in danger because no one really wanted them and they were just sitting there. So I made a mistake. I took some items.\u201d\n According to a memo written by Gallon after he retired in 1989, Sherborne wasn\u2019t aware of the theft until Julia contacted the school soon after her visits.\n \u201cI did not see her again but she wrote expressing her joy at having a collection of Turing items, and included photo of them laid out on a table \u2014 his photo, OBE &amp; so on,\u201d Gallon wrote. \u201cI was not aware that she had taken them, nor indeed was the librarian! I asked him [the librarian] to make a list of the missing items but it proved to be incomplete because we had no inventory anyway\u2026I gave up any hope of ever getting A.T.\u2019s things back \u2018til one day she wrote saying she was sending them back. A parcel arrived. It contained more than the Librarian had listed which made me cross.\u201d\n Both Sherborne and Julia saved some of the correspondence between her and Gallon \u2014 which recently became exhibits in the government\u2019s case in Colorado.\n  After returning many of the items to Sherborne \u2014 indeed, more than the school\u2019s librarian knew existed \u2014 Julia wrote:  Please forgive me for what I did. I know what I did was wrong\u2026.I want you to know that it was very hard for me to steel [sic]. For I have never stolen before in my life and did feel very badly for taking them.\n   Dear Miss Schwinghamer,   I do hope that I have your name right\u2026If the Turing memorabilia arrived safely then all will be forgotten as far as we are concerned. I think I can understand how you have felt and what motivated you is an action out of character with your normal self. Thank you for phoning. It was such a great relief for us when you chose to respond, and I repeat my invitation to come and continue and research in the future.\n On August 20, he followed up to confirm receipt of the items, while noting that Julia did not return one photograph.\n  Dear Miss Schwinghamer,   You will be pleased to know that the parcel arrived safely and I am grateful to you for what is a very [illegible] gesture and one of which Alan Turing [illegible] would be proud. I am sorry that you have retained the one photograph. Particularly as there was a negative among the collection from which you could have had another one done. I have now [illegible] here, and because of your action, you may keep the photograph. I have told the police here that you have returned all but the photograph and that as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. I hope that they will pass this on to the police there, but you will have this letter to show them in case you are questioned.\n Julia seemed to have taken the words \u201cthe matter is closed\u201d at their fullest implication.\n What Gallon likely didn\u2019t know (his letters and memo never mentioned it) was that Julia still had a number of items, including a miniature version of his OBE medal. For Julia, after Gallon declared the matter closed, it seemed that anything she still had of Turing\u2019s was rightfully hers. Once again, his spirit had come through their cosmic connection and made everything work out. Her love for Turing only grew.\n Sometime in early 1988, Julia legally changed her name to Julia Mathison Turing, in a play off of Turing\u2019s father\u2019s name, Julius Mathison Turing. \u201cI was done with being bounced around from place to place and from name to name,\u201d she explains. \u201cI took his name because I thought it was appropriate. He saved my life.\u201d\n The name change was reflected in Julia\u2019s next correspondence with Gallon. Because despite matters being \u201cclosed\u201d in 1984, Julia needed his assistance again a few years later.\n The bizarre episode occurred in late 1988, when Julia had a domestic dispute with a foster sister, Carol Elliot, with whom she was again living in Morro Bay. Carol and Julia had always had a contentious relationship.  According to Julia, Carol thought she was a freak because of her adulation of Alan Turing, and she knew how important the Turing artifacts were to Julia.\n  After an argument over Carol\u2019s boyfriend, whom Julia threatened to report for alleged criminal behavior, Carol took Turing\u2019s Ph.D. diploma and a couple of his photos to the Morro Bay Police Department and told the cops that Julia had stolen them from Sherborne School in England.\n  On September 15, 1988, Julia wrote Gallon, pleading with him to return the diploma to her:\n I am sure that Alan is as sorrowful as I am over my terrible loss of his Ph.D. If there was only some way you could understand just how much Alan means to me. I believe maybe you would allow Alan\u2019s Ph.D. to remain with me until I would eventually return it as I had promised, because you have shown me your generosity to me [sic] before.\n Incredibly, Gallon seemed swayed by Julia\u2019s letters and decided to send back the diploma. On November 19, he wrote:\n Dear Miss Turing:  Thank you for your long letter and the press cuttings. I have written to Sgt. Beuer of the Morro Bay Police saying that you may keep the diploma. If I am too late and it arrives here, I will send it back to you.\n Authorities in Colorado located these letters, along with a customs declaration from Britain, that seem to support this twist in the story: Gallon did gift the Ph.D. diploma \u2014 along with a couple of Turing photos \u2014 to Julia. In fact, rather than being angry with Julia, Gallon even said that he was rooting for her success as an officer in the U.S. Army and as a standout track-and-field star:\n Good luck with the Olympic selection. We shall be looking out for you in 1992.\n At least Gallon wasn\u2019t being misled about Julia\u2019s career accomplishments. They were unbelievable yet true.\n  \u201cFaster than a private dodging his platoon sergeant, speedier than an M-16 on rapid fire, able to leap the Headquarters building with a single bound, look out Flo Jo, here comes Lt. Turing.\u201d U.S. Army writer Cliff Jackson wrote that at the start of an April 11, 1990, article titled \u201cThe Champion\u201d for the newspaper that served Julia\u2019s Army posting in Stuttgart, Germany.\n  The piece continued: \u201c2nd Lt. Julia M Turing is one of the 11th Chemical Company\u2019s platoon leaders. How fast is she? In a 200 meter dash her average time is 22:88; when you compare that time to the world class time of 20.5, that\u2019s nothing to sneeze at.\u201d\n More than a dozen newspaper articles document Julia\u2019s career record as a track star. They range from coverage of her accomplishments in high school (fourth in California\u2019s state finals) to winning the 100, 200 and 400 meter races in the 1988  Community College State Championships in California. After completing her higher  education at Arizona State University, Julia donned a uniform for the Army and continued running as a member of the Armed Forces. In 1990, she was named the military\u2019s \u201cService Athlete of the Year.\u201d  Stars and Stripes noted that she was \u201cthe sixth fastest sprinter in the U.S.A.\u201d\n With headlines like \u201cAgainst All Odds\u201d \u2014 that one from the  Star Presidian of San Francisco \u2014 articles took note of her difficult upbringing and overcoming the challenges of being shuttled between foster families. One article also mentioned that an \u201cAllen A. Turing\u201d [sic] was Julia\u2019s inspiration.\n But then duty called, and Julia\u2019s running career took a break as the U.S. military prepared to invade Iraq. A lieutenant in the Army\u2019s Chemical Company, Julia was stationed in Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Storm, where she briefed incoming soldiers on possible sources of chemical attacks from Saddam Hussein\u2019s forces.\n Julia worried that her deployment would hamper her quest to represent the United States at the Olympics, but after returning from the Middle East, she won six gold medals at the 1991 Armed Forces Championships, breaking a 39-year military record for the most gold medals at a single event.\n  She was at the peak of her training when she arrived at the Olympic trials in Barcelona, Spain \u2014 the final, qualifying event for the 1992 Olympic games. But she also arrived in the Catalonian capital with multiple running-related injuries. Reporters wanted to know: Could she push through it? Julia said that she would try to overcome any pain and give \u201c101 percent,\u201d just as she had at the 1991 Armed Forces Championships.\n But as the deadline approached, Julia\u2019s foot was killing her. She finally got it X-rayed, and doctors found that she had broken it in two places. Her right leg also had stress fractures.\n \u201cYou can\u2019t compete,\u201d doctors said. \u201cIf your leg breaks, you\u2019ll never walk normally again.\u201d\n Julia attempted the 200-meter race anyway, but had to pull up before she rounded the first turn. Her running career was over.\n  After the first Gulf War, the Army downsized. With little use for a chemical warfare specialist, Julia was placed on reserve, she says. She decided to leave the Army and work a low-level job for the Department of Justice instead \u2014 the job that brought her to Colorado. While living on the Front Range, Julia continued to collect and sell Turing-related artifacts and memorabilia. She set up an eBay page where she offered Turing artwork she\u2019d made using oil pencils on h\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-19 08:14:06", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name":

of the Vienna Medical Society\u2019s lecture hall. It was a grand and ornately decorated room where some of medicine\u2019s greatest discoveries were first announced. The evening of May 15 would hardly be different \u2014 even if those present (and many more who merely read about it) did not acknowledge Semmelweis\u2019s marvelous discovery for several decades.\n  What, exactly, was the doctor\u2019s advice to his colleagues on that long ago night? It could be summed up in three little words: wash your hands!\n At this late date, we all expect our doctors to wash their hands before examining us or performing an operation in order to prevent the spread of infection. Surprisingly, physicians did not begin to acknowledge the lifesaving power of this simple act until 1847\n It was then that Dr. Semmelweis began exhorting his fellow physicians at the famed Vienna General Hospital (Allgemeines Krankenhaus) to wash up before examining women about to deliver babies. His plea was far more than aesthetic; it was a matter of life and death and helped to prevent a deadly malady known as \u201cchildbed\u201d or puerperal (from the Latin words for child and parent) fever.\n In the mid-19th century, about five women in 1,000 died in deliveries performed by midwives or at home. Yet when doctors working in the best maternity hospitals in Europe and America performed deliveries, the maternal death rate was often 10 to 20 times greater. The cause was, invariably, childbed fever. And a miserable end it was: raging fevers, putrid pus emanating from the birth canal, painful abscesses in the abdomen and chest, and an irreversible descent into an absolute hell of sepsis and death \u2014 all within 24 hours of the baby\u2019s birth.\n The reason seems readily apparent today, if not back then. Medical students and their professors at the elite teaching hospitals of this era typically began their day performing barehanded autopsies on the women who had died the day before of childbed fever. They then proceeded to the wards to examine the laboring women about to deliver their babies.\n Dr. Semmelweis was brilliant but had two strikes against him when applying for a position at the Vienna General Hospital in 1846: he was Hungarian and Jewish. Medicine and surgery were considered to be the premier specialties in Vienna but because of his background and religion Semmelweis was relegated to running the less desirable division of obstetrics. Nevertheless, his claim to immortality was the result of an obsession with finding the means to end the childbed fever epidemics that were killing nearly a third of his patients. (The hospital ward run by midwives, without autopsy duties, had far better outcomes with their deliveries).\n Every day he heard the heart-rending pleas of women assigned to his care begging to be discharged because they believed these doctors to be the harbingers of death. Fortunately, Dr. Semmelweis was smart enough to listen to his patients.\n The obstetrician made the vital connection that puerperal fever was caused by the doctors transferring some type of \u201cmorbid poison\u201d from the dissected corpses in the autopsy suite to the women laboring in the delivery room. That morbid poison is now known as the bacteria called Group A hemolytic streptococcus.\n  Historians are quick to remind that Semmelweis was not the first physician to make this clinical connection, one that many expectant mothers of the era called \u201cthe doctors\u2019 plague.\u201d For example, the obstetrician Alexander Gordon of Aberdeen, Scotland, suggested in his 1795 Treatise on the Epidemic of Puerperal Fever that midwives and doctors who had recently treated women for puerperal fever spread the malady to other women. More famously, in 1843 Oliver Wendell Holmes, the Harvard anatomist and self-proclaimed \u201cautocrat of the breakfast table,\u201d published \u201cThe Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever,\u201d in which he discerned that the disease was spread by physicians and recommended that actively practicing obstetricians abstain from performing autopsies on women who died of puerperal fever as one of their \u201cparamount obligations to society.\u201d\n That said, it was Dr. Semmelweis who ordered his medical students and junior physicians to wash their hands in a chlorinated lime solution until the smell of the putrid bodies they dissected in the autopsy suite was no longer detectable. Soon after instituting this protocol in 1847, the mortality rates on the doctor-dominated obstetrics service plummeted.\n Unfortunately, Semmelweis\u2019s ideas were not accepted by all of his colleagues. Indeed, many were outraged at the suggestion that they were the cause of their patients\u2019 miserable deaths. Consequently, Semmelweis met with enormous resistance and criticism.\n A remarkably difficult man, Semmelweis refused to publish his \u201dself-evident\u201d findings until 13 years after making them despite being urged to do so repeatedly by those who supported him. To make matters worse, he hurled outrageously rude insults to some of the hospital\u2019s most powerful doctors who deigned to question his ideas. Such outbursts, no matter how well deserved, never go unnoticed, let alone unpunished, in the staid halls of academic medicine.\n Becoming more shrill and angry at each detractor\u2019s critique, Semmelweis lost his clinical appointment at the Vienna General Hospital and in 1850 abruptly left for his native Budapest without even telling his closest colleagues. In 1861, he finally published his work, \u201cDie Aetiologie, der Begriff und die Prophylaxis des Kindbettfiebers\u201d (\u201cThe Etiology, the Concept, and the Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever\u201d), in which he explained his theories on childbed fever, the ways to avoid spreading it by means of vigorous hand-washing and an attack on every one of his critics with a vitriol that still leaps off the page.\n Dr. Semmelweis\u2019s behavior became more and more erratic and he was finally committed to an insane asylum on July 30, 1865. He died there, two weeks later, on Aug. 13, 1865, at the age of 47. Historians still argue over what caused Semmelweis\u2019s mental health breakdown and subsequent death. Some point to an operation Semmelweis performed, wherein he infected himself with syphilis, which may also explain his insanity. Others believe he developed blood poisoning and sepsis while imprisoned in the asylum for what may have been an unbridled case of bipolar disease. More recently, some have claimed that the obstetrician had an early variant of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and was beaten to death in the asylum by his keepers.\n Semmelweis\u2019s professional timing could not have been worse. He made his landmark discovery between 1846 and 1861, long before the medical profession was ready to accept it.\n Although Louis Pasteur began exploring the role of bacteria and fermentation in spoiling wine during the late 1850s, much of his most important work initiating the germ theory of disease occurred between 1860 and 1865. A few years later, in 1867, the Scottish surgeon  Joseph Lister, who apparently had never heard of Semmelweis, elaborated the theory and practice of antiseptic surgery, which included washing the hands with carbolic acid to prevent infection. And in 1876, the German physician  Robert Koch successfully linked a germ, Bacillus anthracis, to a specific infectious disease, anthrax.\n Since the early 1900\u2019s, however, physicians and historians have heaped up high praise for Semmelweis\u2019s work and expressed sympathy for his emotional troubles and premature death. Today, in every school of medicine and public health, his name is uttered with great reverence whenever the critical topic of hand washing is taught. Sadly, in real time, he was derided as eccentric at best and, at worst, as an angry, unstable man who ought to be drummed out of the profession.\n The real truth of the matter is that his detractors were wrong and he was right. Dr. Semmelweis paid a heavy price as he devoted his short, troubled life to pushing the boundaries of knowledge in the noble quest to save lives.\n On the 165th anniversary of publicly announcing his landmark medical discovery, it seems fitting that we pay grand tribute to the great Dr. Semmelweis. Perhaps the gesture he might appreciate the most, however, is for us all to simply wash our hands often and well.\n  Dr. Howard Markel writes a  monthly column for the PBS NewsHour, highlighting the anniversary of a momentous event that continues to shape modern medicine. He is the director of the  Center for the History of Medicineand the George E. Wantz Distinguished Professor of the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan.\n He is the author or editor of 10 books, including \u201cQuarantine!

It\u2019s another for millennials to move there in 2021.\n  Miami, Phoenix, L  as Vegas, and to a lesser degree Austin and Salt Lake City, have one big thing in common: From a human survival standpoint, they\u2019re terrible bets.\n Miami is one of the worst-positioned cities with regard to climate change \u2014 and the rising seas and heat that come with it. Miami is already the hottest major city in the U.S. year-round.\n Phoenix, located in the same spot where the Hohokam people  died from drought (and named for the city\u2019s hubristic ability to rebuild itself), is the hottest U.S. city in the summer.  Average (not high) June, July, and August temperatures hover around 103, 106, and 104\u00b0F, respectively.\n Typically a few degrees behind Phoenix,  Las Vegas is one of the hottest cities in the U.S. and depends on water from Lake Mead, a man-made water supply currently at its lowest level since the 1930s.\n Though less ticking time bomb and more slow burn,  Austin \u2014 the fastest growing city in America in 2020\u2014 sources 100% of its water from the Colorado River, a stressed water source that supplies a fast-growing population currently around  40 million people. Austin is also the nation\u2019s southernmost capital.\n Salt Lake City, another fast-growing Western city, also finds itself at the heart of the West\u2019s 2021 drought. Salt Lake City has one of the highest birth rates in the U.S. and is increasingly attracting a tech-focused crowd.\n  Drought and heat are largely perceived as ephemeral future inconveniences rather than everyday realities. Few Americans go thirsty or hungry compared to other arid regions around the world.\n  By the time I am in my 50s, these places will all be hotter, have more frequent droughts, more strained resources, higher crime rates, and lower economic output.\n  In the upcoming decades, the chances of an extreme heatwave in Phoenix will become increasingly likely. In such an event, water, transportation, and energy infrastructure would crumble, creating the  \u201cHurricane Katrina of Heat.\u201d\n The  risk of drought will triple by 2050. Note that Phoenix is already a desert with an average rainfall of 9.2 inches a year.\n There will be 115 days per year with a high potential for fires by 2050.\n  Miami is considered the  most vulnerable coastal city   in the world. What were once called \u201c100-year floods\u201d could occur regularly \u2014 meaning every couple of years.\n Miami is predicted to see 6 inches of sea-level rise by 2030 and 2 ft by 2060.\n Miami, which is built on silt, is also sinking into the sea. When sea levels rise, saltwater also infiltrates water supplies and septic systems.\n Miami, already the warmest city in the U.S. year-round, has warmed over 2.3\u00b0F since 1970. By 2050, expect 151 days/year to feel like 105\u00b0F or higher.\n Neither Miami, Phoenix nor any Southern or Western city will be abandoned overnight. Instead, growing heat will hurt economies, increase crime, and lower quality of life until people \u2014 slowly and then all at once \u2014 start to leave.\n  Unlike South Africa, which has experienced country-wide drought for the past three years, America has many places with excess water.\n Americans have options \u2014 but they choose to put themselves at risk for climate change?\n   It\u2019s no coincidence that the cities with the most tantalizing marketing campaigns have the worst long-term climate outlooks.\n Phoenix and Miami have to get creative if they\u2019re going to attract millennials to places that will be decidedly less pleasant in 20 years.\n With self-preservation (and real estate prices) in mind, these places have thought of some pretty compelling narratives to get you and me to move there against our better judgment.\n Phoenix has pitched itself as the West\u2019s affordable, sunny millennial city that\u2019s cleaner and more conservative (think: fewer homeless people) than San Francisco and Los Angeles. A person from San Francisco who rents a one-bedroom in San Fran can buy a house in Phoenix \u2014 or so the narrative goes.\n Miami is the crypto, tech hub of the future if you can forget that Miami is sinking and will not have much of a future. Miami is Wall Street South: New York with better weather, prices, and color.\n Austin is a version of Texas palatable enough for Californian migrants. The weather is sunny; the people are liberal; the tacos are great.\n Las Vegas is California without income taxes, great restaurants, and cheap enough for you to afford a house, rather than an apartment. It\u2019s also right next door.\n  Just like Las Vegas created the \u201csin city\u201d brand and the New York State Department of Economic Development owns the \u201cI Love New York\u201d slogan, Austin = big tech and Miami = crypto thanks to marketing dollars.\n One of the silver linings of excellent P.R. campaigns from climate insecure locations is that they\u2019ve done their research:  Northern cities should follow Miami and Phoenix\u2019s examples to become desirable millennial and tech hot spots.\n  Though much of Miami/Austin/Phoenix/Las Vegas\u2019 appeal is cultural, one fact does set them apart: They are notably cheaper than the larger cities to which they oppose themselves.\n    Though real estate investment groups are often blamed for the lack of affordable housing, the real problem is restrictive building laws \u2014 especially in desirable, liberal, and highly regulated cities.\n The above-listed places are cheap because they have lots of land and few regulations (to a fault, considering the aftermath of the Texas storm). By contrast, California is estimated to need  3.5 million additional homes by 2025.\n For the climate-friendly but less glamorous northern cities like Albany, Worcester, and Pittsburg, a successful marketing campaign could make them the climate-proof cities of the future. For New York, Boston, and Seattle, continuing to build affordable housing will be critical to attracting young people.\n  People moving West and South will affect your life, too \u2014 even if you live in Minnesota or Maine.\n Within my lifetime, we will see a mass migration from the South and West toward the North, not because these places will become unlivable hellholes overnight. Rather, the descent into heat-fueled economic uncertainty and discomfort will be slow \u2014 then all at once.\n Even if you are among the climate savvy who lives in a place with fresh water and liveable temperatures, you\u2019ll bear the cost of climate migration, too. For one, before people move North and inland, the federal government will subsidize living in these danger zones for as long as possible.\n The federal government has already agreed to help subsidize a   $6 billion  sea wall to help protect high-rise waterfront condos in Miami.\n Before you move South or West, consider the forces propelling you to do so \u2014 and the cost to you and your country of migrating later in life.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 07:31:00", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u505c\u6b62,stop,\u57ce\u5e02", "title": "\u7f8e\u56fd\uff0c\u505c\u6b62\u79fb\u52a8\u897f\u65b9 ", "title_en": "America, Stop Moving West", "transed": 1, "url": "https://burgesspowell.medium.com/america-stop-moving-west-9cda6a8d92d7", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u505c\u6b62", "stop", "\u57ce\u5e02"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "24b443fdf49e97e6dc0e97eeca4646dc.png", "infoid": 1066793, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters", "note_en": "Two decades ago, before social media existed, Zygmunt Bauman articulated a perfect description of how it would soon shape our behavior and frame our relationships to one another. In his 2000 book  Liquid Modernity, Bauman wrote: \u201cSeen from a distance, (other people\u2019s) existence seems to possess a coherence and a unity which they cannot have, in reality, but which seems evident to the spectator. This, of course, is an optical illusion. The distance (that is, the paucity of our knowledge) blurs the details and effaces everything that fits ill into the Gestalt. Illusion or not, we tend to see other people\u2019s lives as works of art. And having seen them this way, we struggle to (make our lives) the same.\u201d The conditions Bauman described had already emerged in other media environments, such as television, but the participatory nature of the internet and specifically social media would compel everyone involved to develop an online identity, intentionally or not, that would correspond to their offline identity but would never quite mirror it perfectly. The personal brand, that groan-inducing pillar of digital existence, only occasionally amounts to the refined display that its most sophisticated instances embody. For most people, though, a personal brand is an accidental side effect of their digital presence, something they assume to be a faithful reflection of their \u201creal\u201d selves whether it really is or not.\n Even poorly constructed online identities, however, somehow manage to cohere into consistent wholes, thanks to the medium that transmits them. Every social media feed is an endless parade of these fragmentary identities, disaggregated into units of content and passing by quickly enough to evade the scrutiny that would detect their incompleteness. As Bauman presciently realized, the constraints of these digital environments and the sheer volume of users endows even the flimsiest online presences with an illusion of unity. Showing up frequently enough in the feed might elevate one\u2019s presence to a work of art, at least from everyone else\u2019s distracted perspective, and this in turn motivates us all to present our own selves more artfully. The speed of the information flow is essential to the entire illusion: A platform like Twitter makes our asynchronous posts feel like real-time interaction by delivering them in such rapid succession, and that illusion begets another more powerful one, that we\u2019re all actually  present within the feed. If you and I are both present, moreover, that implies that we\u2019re together, something that is always almost true within these social networks but never quite achieved. On Twitter every relationship is thus parasocial, even if bidirectionally so, and perhaps that\u2019s why digital relationships continue to demand in-person reification.\n Something I frequently joke about\u2014a dark truth that begs for humor\u2014is how social media requires continuous posting just to remind everyone else you exist. I once  said that if Twitter was real life our bodies would always be slowly shrinking, and tweeting more would be the only way to make ourselves bigger again. We can always opt out of this arrangement, of course, and live happily in meatspace, but that is precisely the point: Offline we exist by default; online we have to post our way into selfhood. Reality, as Philip K. Dick said, is that which doesn\u2019t go away when you stop believing in it, and while the digital and physical worlds may be converging as a hybridized domain of lived experience and outward perception, our own sustained presence as individuals is the quality that distinguishes the two. As I  wrote in January, silence is effectively impossible on the contemporary internet, where \u201cvoids are just filled by other people\u2019s content, and thus vanish instantly.\u201d The illusions that enable social media to feel like a primary reality (rather than a medium that supplements that reality) have become increasingly seamless and less likely to be broken, but  as Venkatesh Rao has observed, many users are sacrificed at the altar of this reality, slipping through the cracks and becoming \u201cdigitally homeless.\u201d This phenomenon, he writes, flourishes in \u201conline zones where, for whatever reasons, psychologically plausible and inhabitable personas have failed to cohere for a significant subset of people.\u201d The feed algorithms and interfaces treat these users the same way the actual homeless are frequently treated: by pushing them to the margins and concealing them from view. For the online homeless, as digital reality matures, maybe nonexistence is no longer an option.\n  This newsletter is supported by paid subscriptions, so consider\u00a0 signing up\u00a0to get the full experience.\u00a0If you\u2019re curious about the paid issues but hesitant to subscribe without reading one first, let me know and I\u2019ll forward you one to check out.\n Last week\u00a0I wrote about how the tech industry has subsidized \u201cpod life\u201d (and what happens when those subsidies end), the architectural interiorization of the built environment, and why the internet feels like an airport.\n   Measuring McCities: Mapping the \u201cchaininess\u201d of American cities\u2019 restaurant scenes, or \u201cfoodscapes where the food offerings in the landscape can be found just as easily in one place as in many other (often distant) places\u201d (thanks  Dan!)\n The British pursuit of the perfect football pitch, which transformed the sport globally and turned groundskeepers into stars.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 07:30:50", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u53ef\u884c,minimum,warning", "title": "\u6700\u4f4e\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u81ea\u6211 ", "title_en": "Minimum Viable Self", "transed": 1, "url": "https://kneelingbus.substack.com/p/162-minimum-viable-self", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u53ef\u884c", "minimum", "warning"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "9c9564ec6b4c72efeed52466ec517708.png", "infoid": 1066792, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Tmallphile\u6700\u8fd1\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u98de\u76f4\uff0cdammit\uff01\u201d\u5f53\u7ed8\u5236\u65f6\uff0c\u6700\u521d\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6df7\u4e71\uff0c\u4f46\u7ecf\u8fc7\u516d\u5341\u4e09\u4e07\u516b\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u77ac\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\n \u8fd9\u542c\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u5f2f\u66f2\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u808c\u8089\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u7edf\u6cbb\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\uff01\n  \u7ed8\u5236\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u201c\u98de\u76f4\uff0c\u8fbe\u7c73\u7279\u201d\u7684\u6700\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528J\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u662f\u8feb\u5207\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\n A =\uff1aMonad\u5b9a\u4e49if\u3002 y\uff06lt;

2 do. 1 else. py =. a y - 1 gcd =. y +. py if. 1 = gcd do. 1 + y + py else. py % gcd end. end.)\n We\u2019ve defined our   a monadic verb to return   1 if we pass in a \u201cbase case\u201d value of   0 or   1. Otherwise, we recursively execute   a on   y  -  1 to get our   py, or \u201cprevious   y\u201d. Next, we check if the   gcd of   y and   py equals   1. If it does, we return   1  +  y  +  py. Otherwise, we return   py divided by   gcd.\n     This works, but it\u2019s very slow. We know that our recursive calls are doing a lot of duplicated work. If we could memoize the results of our calls to   a, we could save quite a bit of time. Thankfully, memoizing a verb in J is as simple as adding   M. to the verb\u2019s declaration:\n    While our initial solution works and is fast, it\u2019s not taking advantage of what makes J a unique and interesting language. Let\u2019s try to change that.\n The meat of our solution is computing values in two cases. In the case when   y and   py have a greatest common divisor equal to   1, we\u2019re computing   1 plus   y plus   py. Our imperative, right to left implementation of this computation looks like this:\n  We could also write this as a  \u201cmonadic noun fork\u201d that basically reads as \u201c  1 plus the result of   x plus   y:\n  Similarly, when we encounter the case where the greatest common divisor between   y and   py is greater than   1, we want to compute   py divided by that   gcd. This can be written as a  \u201cdyadic fork\u201d:\n  We can read this fork as \u201c  x divided by the greatest common divisor of   x and   y.\u201d\n Now that we\u2019ve written our two computations as tacit verbs, we can use the  \u201cagenda\u201d verb (  @.) to decide which one to use based on the current situation:\n a_a =: 1 + +a_b =: [ % +.a =: monad define M. if. y &lt; 2 do. 1 else. py =. a y - 1 has_gcd =. 1 = y +. py py (a_b ` a_a @. has_gcd) y end.)\n If   has_gcd is   0, or \u201cfalse\u201d, we\u2019ll return the result of   py  a_b  y. Otherwise, if   has_gcd is   1, we\u2019ll return the result of   py  a_a  y.\n  We can elaborate on the idea of  using agenda to conditionally pick the verb we want to apply to help simplify out base case check.\n I find myself producing lots of ranging content from books and articles, like the one you&#39;re reading now, to open source software projects. If you like what I&#39;m doing,  nothing shows your support more than signing up for  my mailing list.\n First, let\u2019s define our base case and recursive case as verbs that we can combine into a gerund. Our base case is simple. We just want to return   1:\n   recursive_case =: monad define M. py =. a y - 1 has_gcd =. 1 = y +. py py (a_b ` a_a @. has_gcd) y)\n Our function,   a wants to conditionally apply either   base_case or   recursive_case, depending on whether   y is greater or less than one. We can write that using agenda like so:\n  And because our   base_case verb is so simple, we can just inline it to clean things up:\n a_a =: 1 + +a_b =: [ % +.recursive_case =: monad define M. py =. a y - 1 has_gcd =. 1 = y +. py py (a_b ` a_a @. has_gcd) y)a =: 1: ` recursive_case @. (1&amp;&lt;)\n Using agenda to build conditionals and pseudo-\u201ccase statements\u201d can be a powerful tool for incorporating conditionals into J programs.\n  It\u2019s conceivable that you might want to implement a tacit version of our   recursive_case. Unfortunately, my J-fu isn\u2019t strong enough to tackle that and come up with a sane solution.\n That said, Raul Miller came up with a one-line solution (on his phone) and  posted it on Twitter.
