Please consider  signing up for a subscription and helping to keep LWN publishing\n   Both the free-software and security communities have recently beenfocusing on the elements of our computers that run  belowthe operating system. These proprietary firmware components are usuallydifficult or impossible to extend and it has long been suspected (andproven in several cases) that there are significant security concerns withthem. The  LinuxBoot Project is working toreplace this complex, proprietary, and largely unknown firmware with aLinux kernel. That has the added benefit of replacing the existing driversin the firmware with well-tested drivers from Linux.\n To understand LinuxBoot and the problem it&#39;s working to solve, we firsthave to discuss how computers actually boot. We usually think of a runningsystem as including the hardware, operating system (OS), andapplications. However, for a number of reasons, there are several layersthat run between the hardware and the OS. Most users areaware of UEFI (which replaced the older BIOS); for many systems, itprepares the system to run and loads the bootloader. These necessary functions are just the tipof the iceberg, though. Even after the computer finishes loading theOS, there are multiple embedded systems also running on thesystem entirely separate from the OS. Most notably, the  Intel ManagementEngine (ME) runs a complete Minix operating system, while  System ManagementMode (SMM) is used to run code for certain events (e.g. laptop lid getsclosed) in a way that is completely invisible to the running OS.\n All of these add up to the LinuxBoot project&#39;s statement thatthere are &#34;at least 2.5 kernels between the hardware and Linux,&#34;;those kernels collectively make up the firmware. Many of these firmwarecomponents are surprisingly complex and capable, with full network stacks and extensivehardware drivers. The firmware is a major concern to the free-softwarecommunity, as it leaves all computers running on a large foundation of codethat is proprietary and unaudited. It is also a major risk to large techcompanies and cloud providers since the firmware presents many opportunitiesfor powerful, persistent exploits and rootkits. Besides these substantialsecurity concerns, improvements in performance and flexibility of the earlystages of boot is also a major motivation for this simplification and move toopen source.\n To work towards a more elegant and open solution, Google launched aproject called NERF, or the  Non-ExtensibleReduced Firmware, which  LWNcovered back in November. The primary goal of NERF was to reduce thefirmware attack surface by removing almost all functionality that was notnecessary to start the operating system (although there are limits on theextent to which this is possible). NERF consisted of a &#34;fullstack&#34; solution of stripped-down EFI firmware, a Linux kernel, and aninitramfs with tools written in Go. Although these components all make upone bundle stored in ROM, they have since been split into separateprojects: LinuxBoot is the firmware and kernel while the user-spaceinitramfs image with Go tools for system booting is available as  u-root. Due to this modularity, LinuxBoot canbe used with a variety of initramfs images.\n   It&#39;s easier to understand how these components fit together if we firstlook a bit closer at the boot process. A UEFI computer boots in four mainphases. The security phase (SEC) and the Pre-EFI Initialization Stage (PEI)are responsible for low-level operations to prepare the hardware and areusually specific to the hardware they are implemented for. After these twostages, the Driver Execution Environment (DXE) loads various drivers,and then the Boot Device Select (BDS) phase can begin.\n The BDS phase is where most of what we as users are aware of happens: thesystem is searched for storage devices, those devices are inspected forbootloaders, and then one of those bootloaders is started. This soundssimple but, due to the many different storage devices and boot schemesavailable, it can be quite complicated in practice. To manage thiscomplexity, the previous DXE stage loads hundreds of drivers on mostsystems, implementing support for the majority of the devices the finaloperating system will be able to use. Further, hardware in the system canprovide &#34;option ROMs&#34; that include additional drivers to beloaded and executed prior to BDS. All of these are potentially vulnerable,and it&#39;s easy to imagine incredibly damaging attacks based on the extensivecapabilities of the largely hidden UEFI.\n This is where LinuxBoot comes in. It starts during the DXEstage, resulting in most of the drivers (and their associated attacksurface) not being loaded. Instead, a Linux kernel is loaded as if itwere a driver. This brings several immediate advantages. The first, andperhaps most exciting, is that the Linux kernel is an open-source systemthat has been subject to a great deal of security scrutiny and receivesregular fixes. This is almost the exact opposite of the case with existingUEFI drivers. The second is a practical improvement: running Linux at thisearly stage provides a standardized and well-documented programmingenvironment for developing further modules. This makes it far morepractical to extend UEFI&#39;s capabilities.\n By loading during the DXE, LinuxBoot runs after the first two stages of theUEFI, but takes over after that point, replacing the UEFI drivers. Ittherefore completely replaces a large portion of the boot process, muchof what is often still colloquially referred to as &#34;theBIOS&#34;. Because LinuxBoot handles the part of the boot process whereI/O devices become available, it eliminates the parts of UEFI with thegreatest security and stability risk.\n  A Linux kernel alone is not of much use; to implement actual systemfeatures, a Linux user space is needed. That user space is providedin an initramfs filesystem, much like the standard Linux bootprocess. There are currently several options available for user-spacetools. One is u-root, which is the originalsolution developed by Google as part of the NERF project. U-root is a tinyimage containing binaries written entirely in the Go programming language, and can optionally be built as a single executable binary foroptimal load and execution times. This makes it similar to BusyBox. U-rootis a complete-enough Linux system to start the final operating system by simply executing its kernel using kexec.\n Another notable option for the user space is  HEADS, which is a Linux system specifically designed to be secure even when an attacker hasphysical access to the system. It achieves this through TPM-based hardwaretrust and extensive protections against firmware attacks. HEADS wasoriginally designed to boot directly from  coreboot, but has been ported to workas a LinuxBoot initramfs as well.\n Essentially any Linux tool set that can be made compact enough to fit inthe available ROM can be built into an initramfs for LinuxBoot, includingBusyBox and other minimal user-space projects. The availability of severalinitramfs images emphasizes the core feature of LinuxBoot: it is an opensystem. Not only is the LinuxBoot source itself available, the community isfree to develop initramfs images that utilize the power of the Linuxkernel to extend the firmware in new directions that were almost impossiblebefore due to the closed nature of UEFI implementations.\n Because of the limitations of the environment available early in theboot process, the LinuxBoot kernel and user space are highlystripped down. You wouldn&#39;t want to use either as your actual computing environment. Instead, LinuxBoot can carry out the next steps to bring thesystem to a usable state. In many cases this is as simple as searching theavailable storage devices for a standard Linux kernel and handing overcontrol using kexec, but LinuxBoot enables more sophisticated boot processes as well. An obvious application iscryptographic verification of the final operating system, building anotherlink in a trusted computing system. The sky is the limit, though, and thereare many possibilities: improved booting from the network, easiersupport for unusual storage arrangements, and advanced securitycontrols, for example.\n Much like the LinuxBoot initramfs depends on the LinuxBoot kernel tostart, so too does the LinuxBoot kernel depend on a previous step in theboot process. This is where coreboot may be involved. LinuxBoot andcoreboot are not competitors, rather they address different stages ofbooting. Remember that the UEFI boot process consists of four stages, ofwhich the third (the driver execution environment or DXE) is the point atwhich LinuxBoot starts. Coreboot is an implementation of the first twostages, where it can replace the UEFI firmware provided by the motherboardvendor. Coreboot only supports a narrow range of hardware but, when it canbe used inconcert with LinuxBoot, it enables an almost completely open bootprocess.\n LinuxBoot itself promises much broader hardware support than corebootbecause the LinuxBoot kernel and initramfs generally do not need to beheavily customized for the hardware\u2014this is a major part of the reason thatLinuxBoot is designed to start after the first few stages of UEFI boot. Thatallows the UEFI firmware to handle the hardware-specific steps thatvendors tend to keep as trade secrets.\n LinuxBoot has been demonstrated on Chromebooks, and has clearapplications for consumer computers. The major target for LinuxBoot atpresent is servers. It has recently drawn quite a bit of attention in the large data centerenvironment; the  Open ComputeProject, which maintains open-source infrastructure designs used byFacebook among others,  recentlyannounced that LinuxBoot developer Ron Minnich is to serve as one ofthe two leads of its  firmwarework. Server vendor Horizon Computing plans to soon release the  Winterfellserver, an Open Compute Project implementation that ships with LinuxBootand NERF. Considering Facebook&#39;s heavy investment in Open Compute, thiscould mean LinuxBoot in use outside of Google soon.\n The LinuxBoot Project has recently become a  LinuxFoundation project. Contributors to the project include Google andFacebook alongside smaller firms Horizon Computing, Two Sigma, and9elements. Judging by the level of interest the project has attracted earlyon, this list seems likely to grow.\n LinuxBoot is a promising development for anyone frustrated with theamount of hidden, proprietary, and highly privileged firmware in theircomputers\u2014and the attack surface and maintenance complexity that all ofthat brings with it. The project&#39;s industry support and ageneral wave of interest in firmware security may make our infrastructuremore secure and bring our devices a bit closer to being under our control.\n     ( Log in to post comments)\n  Thanks for writing this. We are, the GNU/Linux aficionados are waiting for it and hoping that this project sees the daylight. I mean, it should have real-life implementation and usability. It is very very exciting to have this kind of stuff from the beginning of the boot process.   It will certainly allow other people look into the process and probably contribute more with their understanding. I am personally keeping my fingers crossed.  GNU/Linux becomes a bootloader...whoa! kexec is good, but using this in the early stage is a seriously cool step.Moreover, the clutter will go away, the arcane, the opaque thing will not hinder anything.\n  It would be interesting to compare LinuxBoot with Petitboot, which was an earlier attempt at using Linux as a bootloader.\n  Bit of a tangential thought here, but does LinuxBoot run early enough to replace that painfully long memtest process most servers do by default? It&#39;d be cool to have it, say, verify the first 512MB are in working order and then hand that process off to the main kernel which finishes it up in the background.\n  All that sounds great. And devil is in details...  You need to have some minimal firmware part before LinuxBoot. So you support all those 50(?) mainboards supported by coreboot and 99.99% of other PCs just stay with whatever they have written into flash (either old style BIOS or EFI).", "posttime": "2021-06-21 17:15:58", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "linux,linuxboot", "title": "Linuxboot\uff1aLinux\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56fa\u4ef6\uff082018\uff09 ", "title_en": "LinuxBoot: Linux as Firmware (2018)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://lwn.net/Articles/748586/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["linux", "linuxboot"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "a739dd5f349f770b67db5060f72000c1.jpg", "infoid": 1067161, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u53bb\u5e748\u6708\uff0cAlex Hernandez\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5bb6\u5177\u5e02\u573a\u3002\n \u8fd9\u4f4d31\u5c81\u7684\u6267\u884c\u52a9\u7406\u5728\u5979\u7684\u8fc8\u963f\u5bc6\u4e00\u5ba4\u516c\u5bd3\u91cc\u6316\u4e86\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u75b2\u60eb\u4e0d\u582a\uff0c\u5979\u7684\u201c\u4fbf\u5b9c\u548c\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u201d\u5b9c\u5bb6\u6c99\u53d1\u3002\u5979\u5728\u7f51\u4e0a\u8d2d\u7269\u4e86\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5979\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u65b0\u4eba -

She shopped around online and found a new one she liked \u2014 but it was a designer brand that was out of her price range.\n  She spiced things up with a set of mid-century modern legs ($70) and a new cover ($120) from an Ikea customization website. The project cost Hernandez about one-tenth of the designer version she\u2019d had her eye on and it saved an old piece of furniture from the landfill.\n This type of upcycling, called  Ikea hacking, has been on the rise during the pandemic.\n And for companies that sell custom Ikea-friendly fixtures \u2014 legs, couch covers, knobs, and cabinet doors \u2014 business is booming.\n  Ikea has achieved the kind of scale and  brand recognition that most companies can only dream of.\n With  ~$44B in annual revenue,  445 retail stores, and  217k employees, the Sweden-based company is the  world\u2019s largest home furnishings retailer, enjoying a stranglehold on the ready-to-assemble furniture market.\n    In a way, Ikea is kind of like the Bitcoin of furniture: the company uses  universal designs, meaning its hardware and measurements are  uniform across most of the developed world.\n And folks who want to add some pizzazz to their mass-produced Billy bookcases and Kallax shelf units have no shortage of customization options to choose from online.\n Broadly, Ikea hacking is any form of upgrading, customizing, repurposing, or personalizing a piece of stock Ikea furniture.\n The movement gained steam in the mid-2000s, when popular DIY blogs like  Ikea Hackers and  Instructables began offering up easy, affordable tweaks to popular items like Billy bookcases and Kallax shelf units.\n At first, Ikea wasn\u2019t a fan of people customizing its furniture and even sent Ikea Hackers a  cease and desist. But since then, the company has embraced its hackers.\n And over the past decade, this once small and wacky community has burgeoned into a full-fledged industry.\n     Within this broader ecosystem, certain Ikea products have earned a cult following in niche communities.\n Plant enthusiasts use Fabrik\u00f6r cabinets to make their own indoor greenhouses.  Photographers convert Schottis shades into DIY lightboxes.  Parents transform Flisat tables into sensory stations for toddlers. Some have even crafted  sex toys out of Ikea shoe trees and milk frothers.\n In a survey of 1,206 readers of  The Hustle,  half of all respondents said they had heard of the concept of Ikea hacking \u2014 and  43% said they\u2019d engaged in the practice at some point.\n   In our survey, readers had no shortage of their own creative new uses for old Ikea furniture:\n Peter Sanderson (sales director, Rhode Island) converted an Ikea headboard into a dog gate for his Rottweiler puppy.\n  Rick Moore (film technician, Vancouver) transformed an Ikea butcher block cart into a wine rack.\n Laurel Choate (literary agent, New York) made a kitchen island out of Ikea shelves, legs, and a countertop.\n During the pandemic, an increase in remote work and time spent at home has led to a  DIY remodel boom \u2014 and a surge in Ikea hacks.\n Among our respondents,  69% said they had bought new furniture during the pandemic, and  38% said they had updated an existing piece of furniture.\n   \u201cWe disassembled a cheap Ikea table, painted it a new color, and bought new legs to make it more mid-century modern,\u201d says  Zo\u00eb Kronovet, a digital marketing manager in North Carolina. \u201cWe also bought a $300 velvet midnight-blue cover for a basic Ikea couch to give it a new life.\u201d\n Like Kronovet, the majority of Ikea hackers stick to simple aesthetic changes: new knobs on a dresser, a new set of legs on a table, or new cabinet doors \u2014 little touches to shake things up.\n   When on the hunt to revamp old Ikea wares, prospective customers often turn to a cottage industry of e-commerce startups \u2014 mostly female-owned \u2014 that specialize in Ikea customization:\n Superfront,  Norse Interiors: legs, hardware, and cabinet doors for an array of best-selling Ikea products\n On  Etsy, you\u2019ll find dozens of smaller companies hawking handmade legs, brass knobs, shelf inserts, and sofa covers specifically crafted to fit Ikea furniture lines.\n  A before/after kitchen remodel using an Ikea base system modified with Semihandmade mahogany panels (Semihandmade)\n Monica Born quit her copywriting gig 10 years ago to found Superfront with her husband Mick, after noticing that many of her friends in Sweden were commissioning their own pricey Ikea replacement doors from local carpenters.\n In Sweden, where  90% of residents own Ikea furniture, she sensed an opportunity to streamline and normalize the customization process.\n Today, the business offers cabinet doors, handles, and legs compatible with Ikea\u2019s 4 best-selling furniture lines.\n Born says the company is on track to hit  ~$8m in annual sales this year \u2014 a 50% bump from last year.\n \u201cIt\u2019s becoming more and more [common] to tell your dinner guests that you repurposed something,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to say, \u2018We thought it was crazy to throw away that piece of Ikea furniture so we redesigned it instead.\u2019\u201d\n Jana Kagin left a career in psychology to launch the Stockholm-based Ikea customizer Prettypegs in 2012.\n \u201cIkea is such a huge part of Sweden\u2019s DNA \u2014 it\u2019s in our breast milk,\u201d she says. \u201cBut a lot of people want to differentiate from the mass-produced. We offer a more affordable option by pairing DIY with high-end design.\u201d\n As an example, she cites a  customer who was able to reconstruct a  $1.5k West Elm console for  $288 using a set of Prettypegs legs ($60), knobs ($28), and a bit of DIY handiwork.\n  Kim Bui, a Florida-based homeowner, hacked together a designer console replica using custom Ikea legs, hardware, and some elbow grease (XO My Home; graphic: The Hustle)\n Demand is so high, she says, that it\u2019s been hard to keep items in stock.\n \u201cWhen we first started, we thought, \u2018It\u2019s just furniture legs, it\u2019s not rocket science!\u2019 But everything becomes rocket science as a business scales,\u201d she says. \u201cLogistics, hardware, packaging, lacquer, paint \u2014 there are so many moving parts that have strained supply chains right now.\u201d\n While many of these companies are based in Sweden, some entrepreneurs have found success focusing on the US market.\n Lotta Lundaas, the founder of Norse Interiors, based in New York City, says her company is on track to hit  $1m in sales just 3 years after launching \u2014 a  3x increase year-over-year.\n Lundaas leveraged her background as an online marketer to identify which Ikea products to offer custom cabinet doors for, reverse engineering the company\u2019s best sellers by looking at search volume data.\n  Left: A stock Ikea Besta cabinet; Right: An Ikea Besta cabinet upgraded with cane double doors, chrome knobs, and chrome legs from Norse Interiors (Ikea, Norse Interiors)\n  Launched in 2014 with the aim of customizing Ikea kitchen cabinets, the company has since moved into offering its own product lines. But it has trouble keeping its prices appealing to the Ikea demographic.\n \u201cIt\u2019s hard to match Ikea\u2019s economies of scale,\u201d says  Scott Bird, the company\u2019s managing director. \u201cThey sell some of their products at a price that\u2019s lower than what we can even source them for.\u201d\n   Beyond design, Ikea hacking aims to tackle a larger problem: the scourge of so-called \u201c fast furniture.\u201d\n In the 1950s, furniture was seen as a generational investment that would last decades. Today, the average couch lasts just  6 years. Each year, Americans discard  20m tons of furniture \u2014 a figure that has  doubled in the last decade.\n Ikea \u2014 a company that  uses 1% of the world\u2019s entire wood supply and has  encouraged customers to frequently replace furniture in the past\u00a0 \u2014 is at the center of this problem.\n Part of the stated mission of Ikea hacking, and the  upcycling movement at large, is to extend the lifespan of furniture.\n In its own independent research, Prettypegs found that a simple design change could result in a person keeping a piece of furniture  20% longer. The company estimates that it has helped customers hold on to 19k pieces of Ikea furniture, saving 179 tons of CO 2 emissions.\n Consumers are increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of their purchases: In our survey,  60% of respondents said eco-friendliness is an important consideration when buying home furnishings.\n    93% of global consumers expect the brands they use to address and consider environmental issues\n For its part, Ikea has announced  buy-back programs and  plans to be \u201cclimate positive\u201d by 2030.\n But for consumers who already have a house full of Ikea furniture, a little redesigning and repurposing may be the greenest course of action.\n \u201cWe\u2019re all in the business of making Ikea products last longer,\u201d says Cagin, of Prettypegs. \u201cWe want to turn fast furniture into slow furniture.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-21 17:10:53", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5b9c\u5bb6,\u9ed1\u5ba2,business", "title": "\u5b9c\u5bb6\u9ed1\u5ba2\u7684\u84ec\u52c3\u53d1\u5c55 ", "title_en": "The thriving business of IKEA hacking", "transed": 1, "url": "https://thehustle.co/the-thriving-business-of-ikea-hacking/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5b9c\u5bb6", "\u9ed1\u5ba2", "business"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f25f655436894095c4c7278b46380c1f.png", "infoid": 1067160, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "MFAST\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8ba9\u8d8a\u5357\u7528\u6237\u5728\u504f\u8fdc\u5730\u533a\u83b7\u5f97\u91d1\u878d\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5ba3\u5e03\u4eca\u5929\u7b79\u96c6\u4e86150\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b3e\u3002\u8fd9\u5706\u7531Do Ventures\u9886\u5bfc\uff0c\u53c2\u52a0Jafco Asia\u3002\n 2019\u5e74\u7531Fintech\u516c\u53f8DigiPay\u63a8\u51fa\uff0cMfast\u8868\u793a\u5df2\u88ab60\u4e07\u4eba\u4f7f\u7528\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\u3002 IT\u4e0e\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d37\u6b3e\u548c\u4fdd\u9669\u7b49\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u793a\u5df2\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\u5206\u914d\u8d85\u8fc7500\u4ebfVND\uff08\u7ea6220\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff09\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u3002\n   \u5927\u591a\u6570\u6216\u5927\u7ea675\uff05\u523080\uff05\u7684Mffast\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5728\u8fdc\u7a0b\u7701\u6216\u519c\u6751\u5730\u533a\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\u7ecf\u5e38\u9650\u5236\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bf9\u94f6\u884c\u548c\u4fe1\u8d37\u76f8\u5173\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u3002\n \u8d44\u91d1\u5c06\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u5927\u8d8a\u5357\u66f4\u591a\u57ce\u5e02\u548c\u7701\u4efd\uff0c\u53d1\u5c55\u5176\u6280\u672f\u548c\u4f34\u4fa3\u3002 MFAST\u8fd8\u8ba1\u5212\u5c06\u6765\u8fdb\u5165\u5176\u4ed6\u5e02\u573a\u3002\n Mfast\u7684\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u4fe1\u7528\u4f19\u4f34\u5305\u62ecMirae\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0cCIMB\uff0cMCREDIT\u548cEasy Credit\uff0c\u5176\u4fdd\u9669\u4f19\u4f34\u5305\u62ecPVI\uff0cPTI\u548cBSH\u3002\u5b83\u58f0\u79f0\u62e5\u6709\u8d85\u8fc7350,000\u540d\u987e\u95ee\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u63d0\u4f9b\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5176\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u80fd\u591f\u51cf\u5c11\u503a\u52a1\u548c\u6b3a\u8bc8\u7387\u3002 ", "note_en": "MFast, a mobile app that lets Vietnamese users in remote areas access financial services, announced it has raised a $1.5 million pre-Series A today.

MFast also plans to enter other markets in the future.\n MFast\u2019s consumer credit partners include Mirae Asset, CIMB, Mcredit and Easy Credit, and its insurance partners include PVI, PTI and BSH.

It is lightweight, self-arranging, supported on multiple platforms andallows pretty much any IPv6-capable application to communicate securely withother Yggdrasil nodes. Yggdrasil does not require you to have IPv6 Internetconnectivity - it also works over IPv4.\n Although Yggdrasil shares many similarities with cjdns, it employs a different routingalgorithm based on a globally-agreed spanning tree and greedy routing in ametric space, and aims to implement some novel local backpressure routingtechniques. In theory, Yggdrasil should scale well on networks withinternet-like topologies.\n    Please see our  Platforms pages for morespecific information about each of our supported platforms, includinginstallation steps and caveats.\n   If you want to build from source, as opposed to installing one of the pre-builtpackages:\n  Note that you can cross-compile for other platforms and architectures byspecifying the  GOOS and  GOARCH environment variables, e.g.  GOOS=windows ./build or  GOOS=linux GOARCH=mipsle ./build.\n       You will need to edit the  yggdrasil.conf file to add or remove peers, modifyother configuration such as listen addresses or multicast addresses, etc.\n    To run in auto-configuration mode (which will use sane defaults and random keysat each startup, instead of using a static configuration file):\n  You will likely need to run Yggdrasil as a privileged user or under  sudo,unless you have permission to create TUN/TAP adapters. On Linux this can be doneby giving the Yggdrasil binary the  CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.\n     Feel free to join us on our  Matrixchannel at  #yggdrasil:matrix.orgor in the  #yggdrasil IRC channel on Freenode.\n  This code is released under the terms of the LGPLv3, but with an added exceptionthat was shamelessly taken from  godeb.Under certain circumstances, this exception permits distribution of binariesthat are (statically or dynamically) linked with this code, without requiringthe distribution of Minimal Corresponding Source or Minimal Application Code.For more details, see:  LICENSE.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 16:28:26", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5f00\u6e90,\u7f51\u7edc,open,yggdrasil", "title": "Yggdrasil  - \u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a0\u5bc6IPv6\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5f00\u6e90 ", "title_en": "Yggdrasil \u2013 an open source fully end-to-end encrypted IPv6 network", "transed": 1, "url": "https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5f00\u6e90", "\u7f51\u7edc", "open", "yggdrasil"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e71673ab32fdde3e6c4b40981171c72b.png", "infoid": 1067158, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u7684B\u7cfb\u5217\u662f\u6eda\u52a8\u5173\u95ed\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5b83\u5c1a\u672a\u5ba3\u5e03\u6700\u7ec8\u91d1\u989d\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u76843000\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u603b\u5171\u5305\u62ec\u5176\u79cd\u5b50\u8d44\u91d1\u548cA\u7cfb\u5217\uff0c\u6839\u636e7\u67082020\u5e74\u7684Esquire\u83f2\u5f8b\u5bbe\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u8d44\u6599\u662f1400\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u3002 B\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5305\u62ec\u6de1\u9a6c\u9521\u63a7\u80a1\u79c1\u52df\u80a1\u6743\u5355\u4f4d\u4ead\u5b50\u8d44\u672c\uff0c\u817e\u8baf\uff0c\u56fd\u9645\u91d1\u878d\u516c\u53f8\uff08IFC\uff09\uff0cICCP SBI Venture Partners\u548cSaison Capital\uff0c\u5e76\u56de\u5f52\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u7f57\u5bbe\u900a\u96f6\u552e\u63a7\u80a1\uff08\u8fd9\u662fGOKONGWEI\u96c6\u56e2\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff09\uff0cJG Digital\u80a1\u7968\u4f01\u4e1a\u548c\u6ce2\u6d6a\u5236\u9020\u5546\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u3002\n Growsari\u6210\u7acb\u4e8e2016\u5e74\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u793a\u5176B2B\u5e73\u53f0\u76ee\u524d\u7528\u4e8e\u83f2\u5f8b\u5bbe\u6700\u5927\u548c\u6700\u5177\u4eba\u53e3\u6700\u591a\u7684\u5c9b\u5c7f\u7684100\u591a\u4e2a\u5e02\u5185100\u591a\u5bb6\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e97\u3002\u5176\u6700\u7ec8\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u4e3a\u4e00\u767e\u4e07\u7eb1\u4e3d\u8428\u5229\u5546\u5e97\u63d0\u4f9b\u670d\u52a1\u3002\n   \u6839\u636eGrowsari\u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\uff0c\u83f2\u5f8b\u5bbe\u6709\u8d85\u8fc7110\u4e07\u65af\u91cc\u8428\u91cc\u5546\u5e97\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5360\u8be5\u56fd\u9500\u552e\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6d88\u8d39\u54c1\uff08FMCG\uff09\u768460\uff05\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u6279\u53d1\u5546\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5206\u9500\u6e20\u9053\u3002 Growsari\u9664\u4e86\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u5e02\u573a\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u8ba9Sari-Sari\u5546\u5e97\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u4ece\u5927\u7ea6\u4e00\u5343\u4e2aFMCG\u54c1\u724c\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8054\u5408\u5229\u534e\uff0cP\uff06amp;

The $30 million total it has raised include its seed funding and Series A, which  according to a July 2020 profile in Esquire Philippines was $14 million. Participants in its Series B included Temasek Holdings\u2019 private equity unit Pavilion Capital, Tencent, International Finance Corporation (IFC), ICCP SBI Venture Partners and Saison Capital, and returning investors Robinsons Retail Holdings (which is part of the Gokongwei Group), JG Digital Equity Ventures and Wavemaker Partners.\n GrowSari was founded in 2016, and says its B2B platform is currently used by more than 50,000 stores in over 100 municipalities on Luzon, the Philippines\u2019 largest and most populated island. Its ultimate goal is to serve one million sari-sari stores.\n   According to GrowSari, there are more than 1.1 million sari-sari stores in the Philippines, and they account for 60% of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sold in the country, making them a valuable distribution channel for wholesalers. In addition to its supplier marketplace, GrowSari says it is able to give sari-sari store operators better pricing for products from about a thousand FMCG brands, including Unilever, P&amp;G and Nestle, which it claims can help stores double their earnings. Other services in the app include online telecom and utility bill payments, remittance and microfinancing for working capital loans.\n GrowSari\u2019s founding tDeam includes Reymund Rollan, Shiv Choudhury, Siddhartha Kongara and Andrzej Ogonowski, who first launched the platform as a backend system for sari-sari stores to manage their logistics and inventory.\n  Since most sari-sari stores are run individually, their margins are smaller than large retailers that can negotiate deals with FMCG wholesalers. GrowSari\u2019s supplier marketplace addresses this issue by giving sari-sari stores access the Distributor List Prices seen by large stores and wholesalers. GrowSari\u2019s marketplace does not require a minimum order, and it allows sari-sari stores on the platform to pay with cash on delivery, GrowCoins (or cash credits that can be topped up through GrowSari\u2019s shippers, online transfers, banks or over-the-counter at convenience stores) or E-Lista, GrowSari\u2019s seven-day loan product.\n GrowSari\u2019s new capital will be used to expand its userbase to 300,000 new stores in the Philippines, especially in Visayas and Mindanao, increase the size of its supplier marketplace and launch more financial products for sari-sari stores.

Since it was first commercialised in the early 1990s, it has transformed the technology industry with its ability to store huge amounts of energy in a relatively small amount of space. Without lithium, there would be no iPhone or Tesla \u2013 and your laptop would be a lot bigger and heavier.\n But the world is  running out of this precious metal \u2013 and it could prove to be a huge bottleneck in the development of electric vehicles, and the energy storage solutions we\u2019ll need to switch to renewables. Some of the world\u2019s top scientists are engaged in a frantic race to find new battery technologies that can replace lithium-ion with something cleaner, cheaper and more plentiful. Quantum computers could be their secret weapon.\n It\u2019s a similar story in agriculture, where up to five per cent of the world\u2019s consumption of natural gas is used in the Haber-Bosch process, a century-old method for turning nitrogen in the air into ammonia-based fertiliser for crops. It\u2019s hugely important \u2013 helping sustain about 40 per cent of the world\u2019s population \u2013 but also incredibly inefficient compared to nature\u2019s own methods. Again, quantum computers could provide the answer.\n  So far, researchers have been working on these problems with blunt tools. They can perform increasingly powerful simulations using classical devices, but the more complicated the reactions get, the harder they become for supercomputers to handle. This means that right now, scientists are limited to looking only at very small problems, or they are forced to sacrifice accuracy for speed.\n What is quantum computing? How does it work? How will it change the world?  Get the WIRED guide now.\n A hydrogen atom, for instance, has one positively charged proton and one electron and is easy to simulate on a laptop \u2013 you could even work out its chemistry by hand. Helium, next step along on the periodic table, has two protons, orbited by two negatively charged electrons \u2013 but it\u2019s more challenging to simulate, because the electrons are entangled, so the state of one is linked to the state of the other, which means they all need to be calculated simultaneously.\n  By the time you get to thulium \u2013 which has 69 orbiting electrons, all entangled with each other \u2013 you\u2019re far beyond the capability of classical computers. If you wrote down one of each of the possible states of thulium per second it would take 20 trillion years \u2013 more than a thousand times the age of the universe. In his 2013 book  Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Killer App, John Dowling calculates that to simulate thulium on a classical computer, you would need to buy up Intel\u2019s entire worldwide production of chips for the next 1.5 million years, at a cost of some $600 trillion.\n  A much quicker alternative would be to simply measure the atom directly. \u201cClassical computers seem to experience an exponential slowdown when put to simulating entangled quantum systems,\u201d Dowling writes.\n \u201cYet, that same entangled quantum system shows no exponential slowdown when simulating itself. The entangled quantum system acts like a computer that is exponentially more powerful than any classical computer.\u201d Although we\u2019ve known all the equations we need to simulate chemistry since the 1930s, we\u2019ve never had the computing power available to do it. This means that often, when dealing with complex simulations that are intractable for classical computers, the best approach is still to simply try lots of different things in the real world and draw conclusions from observation and experiment.\n \u201cWe can\u2019t really predict how electrons are going to behave right now,\u201d says Zapata\u2019s Christopher Savoie. \u201cIf we can get into a world where we\u2019re simulating it on a computer, we can be more predictive and do fewer actual laboratory experiments.\u201d It is, he says, as if Airbus were still testing planes by building small-scale models and throwing them into the sky. \u201cYou cannot simulate chemical processes that you\u2019re interested in,\u201d says Google\u2019s Sergio Boixo. \u201cWith a lot of the low-level materials science and engineering, you\u2019re kind of blind.\u201d\n  To crack these problems, and lots of others like them, chemists, biologists and physicists need to simulate nature \u2013 and, exactly as Richard Feynman predicted back in the 1980s, they need computers made from quantum components to help them. In a way, you can think of a quantum computer as a programmable molecule, says Boixo\u2019s Google colleague Marissa Giustina. \u201cIt\u2019s a system of many parts that behaves according to the rules of quantum mechanics, like a molecule. You see a path to connect from there to actually programming chemistry in some senses.\u201d\n  IN 2010, AL\u00c1N ASPURU-GUZIK \u2013 a professor of chemistry and computer science, and a co-founder of Zapata \u2013 teamed up with the quantum physicist Andrew White from the University of Melbourne and others to run one of the first ever quantum chemistry simulations. They picked dihydrogen \u2013 a pretty easy molecule, as it goes, and certainly not something that would pose any problems to a classical computer, or even to a physicist with a pen and some paper.\n Dihydrogen \u2013 which is just two hydrogen atoms joined together \u2013 was first analysed using the then-new science of quantum mechanics back in 1927. The aim, at this point, was simply to show that quantum computers could be used for this kind of calculation \u2013 a proof of concept. Their quantum simulation, which ran on a photon-based quantum device, was able to correctly calculate the strength of the bond between the hydrogen atoms, accurate to six parts in a million.\n There are three ways in which quantum computers can help improve our understanding of reactions at the molecular level. The first approach involves building a specific computer to model the problem you\u2019re trying to solve \u2013 physically recreating the molecule with the right number of qubits corresponding to its actual structure. This kind of machine would be simpler to build, but wouldn\u2019t be a computer in the traditional sense \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t be able to easily reprogram it to tackle different problems.\n The second approach involves implementing algorithms that show how a system changes over time. You input the current state of the system, in the form of its wave function, and the level of energy in the system (known as its Hamiltonian, after the mathematician Sir William Rowan Hamilton) and watch it play out over time. These \u2018Hamiltonian simulations\u2019, as they\u2019re generally known, have a huge array of potential uses, and could be particularly useful in understanding and predicting complex reactions involving molecules like thulium, where the electrons are highly correlated.\n  There are a number of active problems like this where classical computers currently struggle, and where quantum computers promise an exponential speed-up. Chemistry challenges just waiting for a quantum computer powerful and reliable enough to crack them range from the extraction of metals by catalysis through to carbon dioxide fixation, which could be used to capture emissions and slow climate change. But the one with the potential for the biggest impact might be fertiliser production. Plants need a healthy supply of nitrogen to grow. The air is full of it, but plants can\u2019t actually pull it from the sky themselves, so farmers have to supplement their crops with nitrogen-rich fertiliser produced using the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process. Forty per cent of the carbon footprint of a loaf of bread comes from producing the nitrogen to make the fertiliser to grow the wheat.\n  But nature has its own method. Some plants rely on bacteria which use an enzyme called nitrogenase to \u2018fix\u2019 nitrogen from the atmosphere and incorporate it into ammonia. Understanding how this enzyme works would be an important step towards improving the Haber-Bosch process and creating less energy-intensive synthetic fertilisers.\n Key to solving that problem is understanding the structure of FeMoco, a complex molecule at the heart of the enzyme that\u2019s too difficult for classical computers to model. In 2017, a research team from Microsoft and ETH Zurich demonstrated that a quantum computer with a hundred logical qubits could solve this problem \u2013 but acknowledged that they would need up to a million physical qubits to form them.\n Another area where Hamiltonian simulations could prove useful is in understanding how plants use the power of the sun. In plants, Photosystem II is a huge, intricate complex of different enzymes that carries out some of the first steps of photosynthesis. Using quantum computers to model the process could help chemists design methods of artificial photosynthesis, enabling them to harness the sun\u2019s power to make fuel.\n Solar panels are another area where quantum computers could help, by accelerating the search for new materials. This approach could also help to identify new materials for batteries, and superconductors that work at room temperature, which would drive advances in motors, magnets and perhaps even quantum computers themselves.\n Zapata is working on a method of finding new materials that uses generative modelling \u2013 similar to its work on providing data for machine learning from a small set of real-world data. \u201cIf we have a sample of a hundred things, we can use generative modelling to create things that are similar,\u201d Savoie explains. \u201cWe can use this to do screening of chemical libraries, or to create virtual chemical libraries to find new compounds.\u201d\n The ability to potentially identify new compounds is one reason why the medical industry is excited about quantum computing. We have already seen how quantum computers should be able to process data from MRI scans more efficiently and accurately, but they could also save billions in drug design, by enabling companies to quickly identify new compounds, and then simulate their effects without having to synthesise them. Furthermore, quantum computing could help scientists model complex interactions and processes in the body, enabling the discovery of new treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, or a quicker understanding of new diseases such as Covid-19. Artificial intelligence is already being used by companies such as DeepMind to gain insight into protein folding \u2013 a key facet of growth and disease \u2013 and quantum computers will accelerate this effort.\n While most of these applications may have to wait for an error-corrected, fault-tolerant quantum computer with thousands or millions of qubits, simulating some natural problems that were previously impossible could, according to some in the field, be within our grasp within the next decade. The first attempts to build quantum computers will be noisy and error-prone, but that could actually make them well suited to simulating nature \u2013 molecules in the real world also exist in a world of noise and interference.\n  \u201cFor many applications of quantum devices, such as cryptography, this noise can be a tremendous limitation and lead to unacceptable levels of error,\u201d write Anton Toutov, a Caltech organic chemist, and Prineha Narang, a Harvard materials scientist, in an article for  WIRED. \u201cHowever, for chemistry simulations, the noise would be representative of the physical environment in which both the chemical system (e.g. a molecule) and the quantum device exist. This means that NISQ simulation of a molecule will be noisy, but this noise actually tells you something valuable about how the molecule is behaving in its natural environment.\u201d\n  When it comes to simulating nature, noise and errors could be a feature, not a bug. Already, small-scale quantum computers equipped with smart, resource- saving algorithms are starting to be used for real-world problems in chemistry and material science.\n  IN JANUARY 2020, researchers at IBM published an early glimpse of how quantum computers could be useful in the NISQ era. Working with the German car manufacturer Daimler on improving batteries for electric vehicles, they used a small-scale quantum computer to simulate the behaviour of three molecules containing lithium, which could be used in the next generation of lithium-sulphur batteries that promise to be more powerful and cheaper than today\u2019s power cells. Instead of running a Hamiltonian simulation, which would have required many more qubits than the researchers had access to, they used variational quantum algorithms \u2013 the third way quantum computers can simulate nature, and likely to be the most useful in the short and medium term.\n Variational quantum algorithms use a hybrid of quantum and classical computers to speed up calculations. In a  blog post, Peter Johnson \u2013 lead research scientist and founder at Zapata \u2013 draws a comparison with the way Google Maps finds you the best route home in a reasonable amount of time. \u201cThe app does not search through all possible routes,\u201d he writes. \u201cInstead, it ends up searching through a well-motivated subset of routes and partial routes.\u201d What Johnson is saying here is that, rather than going in completely blind, Google\u2019s mapping algorithm uses shortcuts and rules of thumb to limit the size of the database it has to search through.\n You might do something similar if you\u2019re looking for a particular house number on an unfamiliar street, and you know that the odd and even numbers are on different sides of the road. Only checking one side of the road halves your search time, with minimal damage to the final result.\n  Rather than trying to do an entire calculation using a quantum computer, variational quantum algorithms can use a limited number of qubits to make a best guess at the solution with the resources available, and then hand over the result to a classical computer which then decides whether to have another go. Splitting the quantum processing over smaller, independent steps means you can run calculations with fewer, noisier qubits than would otherwise be required.\n In 2016, Zapata\u2019s Al\u00e1n Aspuru-Guzik collaborated with Google\u2019s research team in Santa Barbara to simulate dihydrogen again, but this time using the search giant\u2019s superconducting qubits, and an algorithm known as a \u2018variational quantum eigensolver\u2019.\n Again, a quantum computer was able to predict the energy states and bond lengths of the molecule. The technique promises to be easier to scale up to more complex systems without requiring a huge increase in error-correction requirements.\n \u201cWith this method of the variational quantum eigensolver, one of the things you can do is find the minimum energy of your problem,\u201d says IBM\u2019s Heike Riel. \u201cTypically you have an equation which describes your physical system, and one of the problems you have to solve is to find the minimum energy of this equation.\u201d This method requires far fewer qubits than a full simulation, and has a broad range of applications, from optimisation problems like the travelling salesman, through to chemical reactions where you need to find the ground state (the lowest possible energy level of a system), and ones where an excited state (any other energy level) is of interest \u2013 as is the case with photosynthesis and solar energy.\n  As the number of qubits in early quantum computers increases, their creators are opening up access via the cloud. IBM has its IBM Q network, for instance, while Microsoft has integrated quantum devices into its Azure cloud-computing platform. By combining these platforms with quantum-inspired optimisation algorithms and variable quantum algorithms, researchers could start to see some early benefits of quantum computing in the fields of chemistry and biology within the next few years. In time, Google\u2019s Sergio Boixo hopes that quantum computers will be able to tackle some of the existential crises facing our planet. \u201cClimate change is an energy problem \u2013 energy is a physical, chemical process,\u201d he says.\n \u201cMaybe if we build the tools that allow the simulations to be done, we can construct a new industrial revolution that will hopefully be a more efficient use of energy.\u201d But eventually, the area where quantum computers might have the biggest impact is in quantum physics itself.\n The Large Hadron Collider, the world\u2019s largest particle accelerator, collects about 300 gigabytes of data a second as it smashes protons together to try and unlock the fundamental secrets of the universe. To analyse it requires huge amounts of computing power \u2013 right now it\u2019s split across 170 data centres in 42 countries. Some scientists at CERN \u2013 the European Organisation for Nuclear Research \u2013 hope quantum computers could help speed up the analysis of data by enabling them to run more accurate simulations before conducting real- world tests. They\u2019re starting to develop algorithms and models that will help them harness the power of quantum computers when the devices get good enough to help.\n \u201cThese are our first steps in quantum computing, but even if we are coming relatively late into the game, we are bringing unique expertise in many fields,\u201d Federico Carminati, a physicist at CERN, told WIRED in  2019. \u201cWe are experts in quantum mechanics, which is at the base of quantum computing.\u201d The Large Hadron Collider\u2019s landmark achievement so far is undoubtedly the 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson, an elementary particle whose existence helped confirm some long-held but evidence-light theories of quantum physics.\n  In 2018, physicists from Caltech and the University of Southern California re-analysed the data which led to that discovery using a quantum computer, and managed to replicate the results. It wasn\u2019t quicker than a classical device, but it demonstrated that a quantum machine could be used for that type of problem. \u201cOne exciting possibility will be to perform very, very accurate simulations of quantum systems with a quantum computer \u2013 which in itself is a quantum system,\u201d said Carminati. \u201cOther groundbreaking opportunities will come from the blend of quantum computing and artificial intelligence to analyse big data \u2013 a very ambitious proposition at the moment, but central to our needs.\u201d\n In  Computing with Quantum Cats, John Gribbin argues that this could be, if not the most important, then certainly the most profound application of quantum computers. \u201cIf we are ever to have a satisfactory \u201ctheory of everything\u201d incorporating both quantum theory and gravity,\u201d he writes, \u201cit is almost certain that it will only be found with the aid of quantum computers to simulate the behaviour of the universe.\u201d\n  This is an extract from Quantum Computing: How It Works and How It Could Change the World  by Amit Katwala.

Common features and episodes involving these characters can be seen as an example of cultural exchanges between Iran and India which date back to ancient times, even though there is still no consensus among scholars about the extent of the influences of thought and culture of the two nations on each other. Due to the different cultural and geographical environments in which the epics were formed, like any other stories with common roots, the stories of Rustam and Arjuna also have differences. But these differences cannot prevent us from seeing the similarities between the two characters, indicating that the stories must have originated from a common source.\n  The  Mahabharata, which is attributed to the sage Vyasa, was written over centuries and focuses on the war between two families of cousins, the Pandavas and the Kauravas, who compete for the throne of Hastinapur. The Pandava brothers were Yudhisthira, Arjuna, Bhima, Nakula and Sahadeva.\n  Like the  Mahabharata, Iranian epic stories were also narrated orally over centuries by storytellers, although the  Shahnamah was written by the poet, Ferdowsi. As a Muslim poet, Ferdowsi homogenized the stories and emphasized the belief in one god in the spirit of the stories. Nevertheless, the presence of a few powerful ancient gods \u2013 such as Zurvan, Mithra, and Anahita \u2013 in the deep layers of the stories is still discernible. Many scholars have compared characters of the  Shahnamah with gods and goddesses, and Zal, the father of Rustam is one of them. There are obvious vestiges of the worshiping of other gods in the  Shahnamah; for example Fereydun and Zal are Sun worshipers.\n  In the discussion below, I have compiled some of the most striking examples of similarities and parallels in the stories about Rustam and Arjuna, with illustrations from two Mughal Persian manuscripts in the British Library\u2019s collection: a late 15th-century copy of the  Shahnamah with early 17th-century paintings ( Add 5600) and a copy of the  Razmnamah of 1598 ( Or 12076).\n  Like Arjuna in the  Mahabharata, Rustam is one of the most important heroes in the  Shahnamah and the central character of many stories. Arjuna was born to the god Indra, and Rustam is the son of Zal and Rudabah.\n  Zal and Rudabah.  Shahnamah, Mughal, early 17th century. Artist:\u00a0 Qasim.\u00a0 British Library,  Add 5600, f. 42v\n  Zal was born with white hair, which scared his father Sam enough to abandon his child, thinking he was a devil. In the  Mahabharata Pandu, Arjuna\u2019s father was also born extremely pale.\n  In an interesting article, Mihrdad Bahar has highlighted the similarities between Rustam and Indra, the god with whom Kunti, Arjuna&#39;s mother, conceived her child. Bahar notes that Indra and Rustam are both born by caesarean section, they are both large, both eat a lot and drink too much wine, and both have a club. In the  Mahabharata, these traits are also given to Bhima and Arjuna, but as mentioned above, Arjuna was born of Indra.\n  Rustam and Arjuna both marry a woman outside their city or land. In the  Shahnamah, Rustam marries Tahminah, the daughter of king of Samangan, and returns to Sistan after spending a short time with her. Tahminah gives birth to a baby boy and calls him Suhrab. Suhrab later tries to invade Iran and unknowingly fights with his own father, and is eventually killed by Rustam.\n  Rustam kills Suhrab in battle.   Shahnamah, Mughal, early 17th century. Artist: Qasim. British Library,  Add 5600, f. 99r\n  In the  Mahabharata, Arjuna marries  Chitrangda, Raja Manpour&#39;s daughter. Raja Manpour agrees to the marriage on the condition that if his daughter becomes pregnant, the child will stay with him, which Arjuna accepts. Like Tahminah, Chitrangada gives birth to a baby boy, called Babruvahana. In time, Babruvahana too fights with his own father, Arjuna, although unlike Rustam, Arjuna does indeed recognize his son.\n  In both stories, the surviving hero goes in search of a magic medicine to revive the wounded or killed hero. In the  Shahnamah, this medicine is called  Nushdaru and in the  Mahabharata, Samjioni. Nushdaru is held by Kay Kavus, the king of Iran. Kay Kavus is afraid that Suhrab will join forces with Rustam after his recovery, and overthrow him from power. Therefore Kay Kavus refuses to give the medicine to Rustam, and Suhrab consequently dies. In the  Mahabharata, however, when Babruvahana goes in search of  Samjioni he manages to find it, and thus saves Arjuna from death.\n  Battle between Babhruvahana, son of Arjuna, and the snakes, for  Samjioni. Razmnamah, Mughal, 1598. Artist: Sangha. British Library,  Or 12076, f. 71r\n  Despite the differences, both stories have a similar plot, involving the murder of a family member. In both epics, the fathers cause the war with their sons. Suhrab and Babruvahana both plea with their fathers to stop the war, but in both cases the fathers refuse.\n  Babruvahana kneels at Arjuna\u2019s feet in Manipur, but Arjuna treats his son with contempt.\u00a0   Razmnamah,   Mughal, 1598. Artist: Khem. British Library,  Or 12076, f. 44r\n  Another parallel in stories about Rustam and Arjuna is that both heroes kill their stepbrothers, with Arjuna killing Karna and Rustam killing Shaghad.\n  Rustam, impaled in the pit of spears, shoots Shaghad through the tree trunk.  Shahnamah,  Mughal, early 17th century. Artist: Bhagvati.\u00a0 British Library,  Add 5600, f. 338v\n  In the  Shahnamah, Shaghad is born from another mother from Rustam. Meanwhile, in the  Mahabharata, Karna has a different father from Arjuna, for before Kunti marries Pandu, she conceives Karna with Surya. In both epics, both stepbrothers join the enemies of their brothers. In the  Mahabharata, Karna joins Kaurava\u2019s army, and in the  Shahnamah, Shaghad allies with the king of Kabul.\n  In both stories, Rustam and Arjuna also go on adventurous and dangerous journeys to help the king. In the  Shahnamah, these journeys of Rustam are called  Haft Khan (&#39;Seven trials&#39;). Rustam, who was a teenager at the time, was commissioned by Zal to go to Mazandaran to rescue Kay Kavus, the king of Iran. Kay Kavus had been deceived by the devil and had gone to Mazandaran, where he had been captured by a white demon. Rustam was forced to take a shorter route to rescue him immediately, but thereby had to confront seven dangers lurking on his way.\n  Rustam kills the white demon ( Div) .  Shahnamah, Mughal, early 17th century. Artist: Qasim.\u00a0 British Library,  Add 5600, f. 75v       In Arjuna\u2019s story, the hero&#39;s journey takes a year. To help his brother, Yudhisthira, Arjuna has to undertake a quest called  Ashwamedha Yagya. As part of this formal undertaking, he must take a sacrificial horse into the country for a year to fight the opposition, and at the end return the horse to his brother&#39;s capital for sacrifice. It was during this trip that Arjuna got into a fight with his son Babruvahana and was killed by him, before being revived with the remedy  Samjioni.\n  The Persian manuscripts reproduced in this blog, together with several other illustrated copies of the  Shahnamah, have been fully digitised and can be accessed on the Library\u2019s  Digitised Manuscripts portal, and the  Digital access to Persian manuscripts page.\n  Further reading  Bah\u0101r, Mihrd\u0101d,  Pizh\u016bhish\u012b dar as\u0101\u1e6d\u012br-i \u012ar\u0101n, Tihr\u0101n: \u0100g\u0101h, 1375 (1996).

s\u5f62\u3002 ", "note_en": "We now have a three-dimensional map of one of the boundaries of the Solar System.\n For the first time, astronomers have been able to determine the shape of the heliosphere, the boundary that marks the end of the influence of our star&#39;s solar wind. This discovery could help us better understand the environment of the Solar System, and how it interacts with interstellar space.\n   &#34;Physics models have theorized this boundary for years,&#34;  said astronomer Dan Reisenfeld of Los Alamos National Laboratory. &#34;But this is the first time we&#39;ve actually been able to measure it and make a three-dimensional map of it.&#34;\n Actually, we have had encounters with the edge of the heliosphere, a boundary known as the heliopause. Both Voyager probes, launched over 40 years ago, have encountered it and  traveled past into interstellar space.\n The heliopause is a fascinating place. The Sun is constantly gusting a stream of charged particles - a supersonic wind of ionized plasma - out into space. Eventually, the solar wind loses strength over distance, so that it is no longer sufficient to push against the pressure of interstellar space. The point at which that happens is the heliopause.\n Interstellar space doesn&#39;t have a great deal of material in it, but there&#39;s enough that it does have a low density of atoms, and a cosmic wind blowing between the stars.\n The shape of the boundary between the two has been a matter of some debate. Is it a rounded bubble? A comet-shaped structure, with a tail streaming behind the Solar System as it moves around the Milky Way galaxy? Or something a bit more like a  strange croissant?\n   We can&#39;t exactly just nip over and take a survey - Voyagers 1 and 2 were 121 and 119 astronomical units from the Sun respectively when they encountered the heliopause, and had taken decades to get there.\n But that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t take a look. Reisenfeld and his team used data from NASA&#39;s Earth-orbiting Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) satellite, an observatory that measures particles flung from the heliosheath, the very outer region of the heliosphere.\n Some of those particles are what scientists call energetic neutral atoms, or ENAs. These are generated by collisions between particles from the solar wind and particles from the interstellar wind, and the strength of their signal depends on the strength of the solar wind at the time of the collision - just like the wind on Earth, the solar wind doesn&#39;t always blow at the same intensity.\n Decoding this signal to map the heliopause is a bit like the way a bat uses sonar to map its physical surroundings. The strength of the signal and the time lag between sending and receiving can reveal the shape and distance of obstacles.\n   &#34;The solar wind &#39;signal&#39; sent out by the Sun varies in strength, forming a unique pattern,&#34;  explained Reisenfeld.\n &#34;IBEX will see that same pattern in the returning ENA signal, two to six years later, depending on ENA energy and the direction IBEX is looking through the heliosphere. This time difference is how we found the distance to the ENA-source region in a particular direction.&#34;\n The team used data from a full solar cycle, from 2009 to 2019. The map thus generated is still a little approximate, but it&#39;s already revealing interesting things about the heliopause.\n  We now know, for example, that the shape of it (animated above) appears to be a bit comet-like after all, with a tail that&#39;s at least 350 astronomical units long (that&#39;s the current limit of IBEX&#39;s reach), although the length of the tail is impossible to gauge. It could be short and stumpy. On the other hand, the minimum radial distance to the &#39;nose&#39; of the heliopause seems to be around 110 to 120 astronomical units, consistent with the Voyager crossings.\n At high latitudes, the heliopause extends to 150 to 175 astronomical units. This shows that the shape is more bullet-like, not at all consistent with the weird croissant model.\n The IBEX mission is still going, and will continue until at least 2025. The  Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe is due to commence in 2025, picking up where IBEX leaves off.\n The team hopes that both these missions will provide more data to help refine the heliopause&#39;s shape.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 15:39:42", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "ios,\u592a\u9633\u7cfb,solar,ibex", "title": "\u6211\u4eec\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u7684\u5e7d\u6781\u773c\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a3D\u5730\u56fe ", "title_en": "The first-ever 3D map of our solar system's heliosphere", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.sciencealert.com/for-the-first-time-astronomers-have-mapped-the-boundary-of-the-heliosphere", "via": "", "real_tags": ["ios", "\u592a\u9633\u7cfb", "solar", "ibex"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067154, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "KCGI\u662f\u7528\u4e8eC / C ++ Web\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u5f00\u6e90CGI\u548cFastCGI\u5e93\u3002\u5b83\u662f\u6700\u5c0f\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u53ef\u60b2\u7684\u3002\n  \u8981\u542f\u52a8\uff0c\u8bf7\u5b89\u88c5\u5e93\u3002\u7136\u540e\u9605\u8bfb\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u6307\u5357\u3002\u4f7f\u7528GitHub Tracker\u8fdb\u884c\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u6216\u67e5\u627e\u8054\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\u76f4\u63a5\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\n  #include\uff06lt;

Installation instructions tracking the repository\t\t\t\tversion may be found on that page.\n  Well-deployed web servers, such as the default  OpenBSD server, by\t\t\t\tdefault are deployed within a  chroot(2). If\t\t\t\tthis is the case, you&#39;ll need to statically link your binary.\n    FastCGI applications may either be started directly by the web server (which is popular with  Apache) or  externally given a socket and  kfcgi(8) (this method is normative for OpenBSD&#39;s  httpd(8) and\t\t\t\tsuggested for the security precautions taken by the wrapper).\n  The  kcgi manpages, starting with  kcgi(3), are the\t\t\t\tcanonical source of documentation. \t\t\t\tThe following is a list of all manpages:\n    If it&#39;s easier to start by example, you can use \t\t\t\t kcgi-framework as an initial boilerplate to\t\t\t\tstart your project.\t\t\t\tThe following are introductory materials to the system.\n      Dzonsons, Kristaps.

and  khttp_fcgi_parse(3), which receives new\t\t\t\tparsed requests.\t\t\t\tIn either case, requests must be freed by  khttp_free(3).\n  All functions isolate the parsing and validation of untrusted network data within a  sandboxed\t\t\t\tchild process.\t\t\t\tSandboxes limit the environment available to a process, so exploitable errors in the parsing process (or\t\t\t\tvalidation with third-party libraries) cannot touch the system environment.\t\t\t\tThis parsed data is returned to the parent process over a socket.\t\t\t\tIn the following, the  HTTP parser and  input validator manage a single HTTP request, while\t\t\t\t connection delegator accepts new HTTP requests and passes them along.\n    This method of sandboxing the untrusted parsing process follows  OpenSSH, and requires special handling for each operating\t\t\t\tsystem:\n  This requires a fairly new kernel (\u2265Linux 3.5).\t\t\t\t\tIt is supplemented by  setrlimit(2) limiting.\t\t\t\t\tFor the time being, this feature is only available for x86, x86_64, and arm architectures.\t\t\t\t\tIf you&#39;re using another one, please send me your  uname -m and, if you know if it,\t\t\t\t\tthe correct  AUDIT_ARCH_xxx found in  /usr/include/linux/audit.h.\n        This uses the sandboxing profile for  pure computation as provided in Mac OS X Leopard and\t\t\t\t\tlater.\t\t\t\t\tThis is supplemented by resource limiting via  setrlimit(2).\n    Uses the capabilities facility on  FreeBSD 10 and later.\t\t\t\t\tThis is supplemented by resource limiting with  setrlimit(2).\n  Since validation occurs within the sandbox, special care must be taken that validation routines don&#39;t\t\t\t\taccess the environment (e.g., by opening files, network connections, etc.), as the child\t\t\t\t might be abruptly killed by the sandbox facility.\t\t\t\t(Not all sandboxes do this.)\t\t\t\tIf required, this kind of validation can take place after the parse validation sequence.\n  The connection delegator is similar, but has different sandboxing rules, as it must manage an open\t\t\t\tsocket connection and respond to new requests.\n  kcgi is shipped with a fully automated testing framework executed with\t\t\t\t make regress.\t\t\t\tTo test your own applications, use the  kcgiregress(3) library.\t\t\t\tThis framework acts as a mini-webserver, listening on a local port, translating an HTTP document into a\t\t\t\tminimal CGI request, and passing the request to a  kcgi CGI client.\t\t\t\tFor internal tests, test requests are constructed with  libcurl.\t\t\t\tThe binding local port is fixed: if you plan on running the regression suite, you may need to\t\t\t\ttweak its access port.\n  Another testing framework exists for use with the  American\t\t\t\t\tfuzzy lop.\t\t\t\tTo use this, you&#39;ll need to compile the  make afl target with your compiler of choice, e.g.,\t\t\t\t make clean, then  make afl CC=afl-gcc.\t\t\t\tThen run the  afl-fuzz tool on the  afl-multipart,  afl-plain, and\t\t\t\t afl-urlencoded binaries using the test cases (and dictionaries, for the first) provided.\n  Security comes at a price\u2014but not a stiff price.\t\t\t\tBy design,  kcgi incurs overhead in three ways: first, spawning a child to\t\t\t\tprocess the untrusted network data; second, enacting the sandbox framework; and third, passing parsed\t\t\t\tpairs back to the parent context.\t\t\t\tIn the case of running CGI scripts,  kcgi performance is bound to the operating\t\t\t\tsystem&#39;s ability to spawn and reap processes.\t\t\t\tFor FastCGI, the bottleneck becomes the transfer of data.\t\t\t\tIn the following graph, I graph the responsiveness of  kcgi against the baseline\t\t\t\tweb-server performance.\n    This shows the empirical cumulative distribution of a statisically-significant number of page requests\t\t\t\tas measured by  ab(1) with 10 concurrent\t\t\t\trequests.\t\t\t\tThe  CGI line is the CGI sample included in the source;\t\t\t\tthe  FastCGI line is the FastCGI sample;\t\t\t\tthe  CGI (simple) simply emits a 200 HTTP status and  Hello, World;

", "note_en": "Developing forms of plastic that don&#39;t take centuries to break down after use is a common objective among eco-conscious material scientists, and lately we&#39;re seeing how bacteria might offer a helping hand. Scientists at the University of Edinburgh have taken this idea one step further, by demonstrating how an engineered form of  E. coli bacteria can be used to turn plastic bottles into vanillin, the primary compound of vanilla flavoring.\n Discoveries in recent years have demonstrated how bacteria might help us tackle the monumental problem of plastic waste. These have included the unearthing of enzymes produced by bacteria that lurk around recycling centers in Japan and  feed on the material as an energy source, and the use of  bacterial biofilms that can trap difficult-to-trace microplastic particles. Lately, we&#39;ve also seen how embedding enzymes in plastic during production can enable the material to  break down in days, or even  keep itself clean.\n The new research from University of Edinburgh scientists is pioneering in that it doesn&#39;t just seek to quickly break down single-use plastics, but use bacteria to turn it into something useful. The team focused on polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the plastic typically used for packaging of everything from food, to shampoos to soda bottles, and generates around 50 million tonnes of waste each year.\n While PET can be converted into its original building blocks that are used to produce more PET plastics through current recycling methods, the authors of the new study sought to turn it into something else entirely. They developed a technique that uses an engineered form of  E. coli bacteria to take aim at a PET waste product called terephthalic acid (TA). With fine-tuning of the chemical reactions, the bacteria was added to degraded PET plastic bottles and was able to convert 79 percent of the TA to vanillin.\n &#34;This is the first example of using a biological system to upcycle plastic waste into a valuable industrial chemical and this has very exciting implications for the circular economy,&#34; says first author of the study Joanna Sadler. \u201cThe results from our research have major implications for the field of plastic sustainability and demonstrate the power of synthetic biology to address real-world challenges.&#34;\n While vanillin is the main chemical component of extracted vanilla beans, it has wide-ranging applications beyond just the food industry, also serving as an ingredient in herbicides, cosmetics, cleaning products and anti-foaming agents. So, if the scientists can demonstrate how their technique can be scaled up, it could offer a new source for a product the world uses tens of thousands of tonnes of each year.\n &#34;This is a really interesting use of microbial science at the molecular level to improve sustainability and work towards a circular economy,&#34; says Dr Ellis Crawford Publishing Editor at the Royal Society of Chemistry. &#34;Using microbes to turn waste plastics, which are harmful to the environment, into an important commodity and platform molecule with broad applications in cosmetics and food is a beautiful demonstration of green chemistry.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-21 15:34:41", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u964d\u7ea7,converts,\u7ec6\u83cc", "title": "\u7ec6\u83cc\u5c06\u53ef\u964d\u7ea7\u7684\u5851\u6599\u74f6\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9999\u8349\u5473 ", "title_en": "Bacteria converts degraded plastic bottles into vanilla flavoring", "transed": 1, "url": "https://newatlas.com/materials/bacteria-converts-pet-plastic-waste-vanilla-flavoring/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u964d\u7ea7", "converts", "\u7ec6\u83cc"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "23023bb0eef78e14bb7e804ea68e559d.jpeg", "infoid": 1067152, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u534e\u76db\u987f\uff08AP\uff09 - \u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d4e\u91d1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u653b\u51fb\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u8054\u90a6\u8c03\u67e5\u5c40\u5bf9\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u4e1a\u52a1\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u6765\u52a0\u500d\uff1a\u4e0d\u8981\u652f\u4ed8\u7f51\u7edc\u72af\u7f6a\u5206\u5b50\u3002 ", "note_en": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 As ransomware attacks  surge, the FBI is doubling down on its guidance to affected businesses: Don't pay the cybercriminals.

\u8c22\u8c22\uff01 ", "note_en": "The DOM is the foundation of the web platform programming model, and its design and performance impacts the rest of the browser pipeline. However, its history and evolution is far from a simple story.\n Over the past three years, we\u2019ve embarked on an in-flight refactoring of the DOM in Microsoft Edge, with our eye on a modernized architecture offering better real-world performance and reduced complexity. In this post, we\u2019ll walk you through the history of the DOM in Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge, and the impact of our recent work to modernize the DOM Tree, which is already resulting in substantially improved performance in the Windows 10 Creators Update.\n  What we think of as \u201cthe DOM\u201d is really the cooperation of several subsystems. In Microsoft Edge, this includes JS binding, events, editing, spellchecking, HTML attributes, CSSOM, text, and others, all working together. Of these subsystems, the DOM \u201ctree\u201d is at the center.\n Several years ago, we began a long journey to update to a modern DOM \u201ctree\u201d (node connectivity structures). By modernizing the core tree, which we completed in Microsoft Edge 14, we landed a new baseline and the scaffolding to deliver on our promise of a fast and reliable DOM. With Windows 10 Creators Update and Microsoft Edge 15, the journey we started is beginning to bear fruit.\n  We\u2019re just scratching the surface, but want to take this opportunity to  geek out a bit, and share some of the internal details of this journey, starting with the DOM\u2019s arcane history and showcasing some of our accomplishments along the way.\n  When web developers today think of the DOM, they usually think of a tree that looks something like this:\n  However nice and simple (and obvious) this seems, the reality of Internet Explorer\u2019s DOM implementation was much more complicated.\n Simply put, Internet Explorer\u2019s DOM was designed for the web of the 90s. When the original data structures were designed, the web was primarily a document viewer (with a few animated GIFs and other images thrown in). As such, algorithms and data structures more closely resembled those you might see powering a document viewer like Microsoft Word. Recall in the early days of the web that there was no JavaScript to allow scripting a web page, so the DOM tree as we know it didn\u2019t exist.  Text was king, and the DOM\u2019s internals were designed around fast, efficient text storage and manipulation. Content editing (WYSIWYG) was already a feature at the time, and the manipulation paradigm centered around the editing cursor for character insertion and limited formatting.\n  As a result of its text-centric design, the principle structure of the DOM was the  text backing store, a complex system of text arrays that could be efficiently split and joined with minimal or no memory allocations. The backing store represented both text  and tags as a linear progression, addressable by a global index or  Character Position (CP). Inserting text at a given CP was highly efficient and copy/pasting a range of text was centrally handled by an efficient \u201csplice\u201d operation. The figure below visually illustrates how a simple markup containing \u201chello world\u201d was loaded into the text backing store, and how CPs were assigned for each character and tag.\n  To store non-textual data (e.g. formatting and grouping information), another set of objects was separately maintained from the backing store: a doubly-linked list of  tree positions (TreePos objects).  TreePos objects were the semantic equivalent of tags in HTML source markup \u2013 each logical element was represented by a begin and end  TreePos. This linear structure made it very fast to traverse the entire DOM \u201ctree\u201d in depth-first pre-order traversal (as required for nearly every DOM search API and CSS/Layout algorithm). Later, we extended the  TreePos object to include two other kinds of \u201cpositions\u201d:  TreeDataPos (for indicating a placeholder for text) and  PointerPos (for indicating things like the caret, range boundary points, and eventually for \u201cnew\u201d features like  generated content nodes).\n Each  TreePos object also included a  CP object, which acted as the tag\u2019s global ordinal index (useful for things like the legacy  document.all API).  CPs were used to get from a  TreePos into the text backing store, easily compare node order, or even find the length of text by subtracting  CP indices.\n To tie it all together, a  TreeNode bound pairs of tree positions together and established the \u201ctree\u201d hierarchy expected by the JavaScript DOM as illustrated below.\n   The foundation of  CPs caused much of the complexity of the old DOM. For the whole system to work properly,  CPs had to be up-to-date. Thus,  CPs were updated after  every DOM manipulation (e.g. entering text, copy/paste, DOM API manipulations, even clicking on the page\u2014which set an insertion point in the DOM). Initially, DOM manipulations were driven primarily by the HTML parser, or by user actions, and the  CPs-always-up-to-date model was perfectly rational. But with rise of JavaScript and DHTML, these operations became much more common and frequent.\n To compensate, new structures were added to make these updates efficient, and the  splay tree was born, adding an overlapping series of tree connections onto TreePos objects. The added complexity helped with performance\u2014at first; global  CP updates could be achieved with  O(log n) speed. Yet, a splay tree is really only optimized for repeated local searches (e.g., for changes centered around one place in the DOM tree), and did not prove to be a consistent benefit for JavaScript and its more random-access patterns.\n Another design phenomenon was that the previously-mentioned \u201csplice\u201d operations that handled copy/paste, were extended to handle all tree mutations. The core \u201csplice engine\u201d worked in three steps, as illustrated in the figure below.\n  In step 1, the engine would \u201crecord\u201d the splice by traversing the tree positions from the start of the operation to the end. A splice record was then created containing command instructions for this action (a structure re-used in the browser\u2019s Undo stack). In step 2, all nodes (i.e.,  TreeNode and  TreePos objects) associated with the operation were deleted from the tree. Note that in the IE DOM tree,  TreeNode/ TreePos objects were distinct from the script-referenced  Element objects to facilitate overlapping tags, so deleting them was not a functional problem. Finally, in step 3, the splice record was used to \u201creplay\u201d (re-create) new objects in the target location. For example, to accomplish an  appendChild DOM operation, the splice engine created a range around the node (from the  TreeNode\u2018s begin  TreePos to its end), \u201cspliced\u201d the range out of the old location, and created new nodes to represent the node and its children in the new location. As you can imagine, this created a lot of memory allocation churn, in addition to the inefficiencies of the algorithm.\n  These are just a few of the examples of the complexity of the Internet Explorer DOM. To add insult to injury, the old DOM had no encapsulation, so code from the Parser all the way to the Display systems had  CP/ TreePos dependencies, which required many dev-years to detangle.\n With complexity comes errors, and the DOM code base was a reliability liability. According to an internal investigation, from IE7 to IE11, approximately 28% of all IE reliability bugs originated from code in core DOM components. This complexity also manifested as a tax on agility, as each new HTML5 feature became more expensive to implement as it became harder to retrofit concepts into the existing architecture.\n  The launch of  Project Spartan created the perfect opportunity modernize our DOM. Free from platform vestiges like  docmodes and  conditional comments, we began a massive refactoring effort. Our first, and most critical target: the DOM\u2019s core tree.\n We knew the old text-centric model was no longer relevant; we needed a DOM tree that actually  was a tree internally in order to match the expectations of the modern DOM API. We needed to dismantle the layers of complexity that made it nearly impossible to performance-tune the tree and the other surrounding systems. And finally, we had a strong desire to encapsulate the new tree to avoid creating cross-component dependencies on core data structures. All of this effort would lead to a DOM tree with the right model in place, primed and ready for additional improvements to come.\n To make the transition to the modern DOM as smooth as possible (and to avoid building a new DOM tree in isolation and attempting to drop and stabilize untested code at the end of the project\u2014a.k.a. the very definition of \u201cbig bang integration\u201d), we transitioned the existing codebase in-place in three phases. The first phase of the project defined our tree component boundary with corresponding APIs and contracts. We chose to design the APIs as a set of \u201creader\u201d and \u201cwriter\u201d functions that operated on nodes. Instead of APIs that look like this:\n    This API design discourages callers from thinking about tree objects as actors with their own state. As a result, a tree object is only an identity in the API, allowing for more robust contracts and hiding  representational details, which proved useful in phase 3.\n The second phase migrated all code that depended on legacy tree internals to use the newly established component boundary APIs instead. During this migration, the implementation of the tree API would continue to be powered by the legacy structures. This work took the most time and was the least glamorous; it took several dev-years to detangle consumers of the old tree structures and properly encapsulate the tree. Staging the project this way let us release EdgeHTML 12 and 13 with our fully-tested incremental changes, without disrupting the shipping schedule.\n In the third and final phase, with all external code using the new tree component boundary APIs, we began to refactor and replace the core data structures. We consolidated objects (e.g., the separate  TreePos,  TreeNode, and  Element objects), removed the splay tree and splice engine, dropped the concept of  PointerPos objects, and removed the text backing storage (to name a few). Finally, we could rid the code of  CPs.\n The new tree structure is simple and straightforward; it uses four pointers instead of the usual five to maintain connectivity: parent, first-child, next, and previous sibling (last-child is computed as the parent\u2019s first-child\u2019s previous sibling) and we could hide this last-child optimization behind our  TreeReader APIs without changing a single caller. Re-arranging the tree is fast and efficient, and we even saw some improvements in CPU performance on public DOM APIs, which were nice side-effects of the refactoring work.\n  With the new DOM tree, reliability also improved significantly, dropping from 28% of all reliability issues to just around 10%, and at the same time providing secondary benefits of reducing time spent debugging and improving team agility.\n  While this feels like the end of our journey, in fact it\u2019s just the beginning. With our DOM tree APIs in place and powered by a simple tree, we turned our attention to the other subsystems that comprise the DOM, with an eye towards two classes of inefficiencies: inefficient implementations inside the subsystems, and inefficient communication between them.\n  For example, one of our top slow DOM APIs (even after the DOM tree work) has historically been  querySelectorAll. This is a general-purpose search API, and uses the selectors engine to search the DOM for specific elements. Not surprisingly, many searches involve particular element  attributes as search criteria (e.g., an element\u2019s  id, or one of its class identifiers). As soon as the search code entered the attributes subsystem, it ran into a whole new class of inefficiencies, completely unrelated to those addressed by the new DOM tree.\n For the attributes subsystem, we are simplifying the storage mechanism for element content attributes. In the early days of the web, DOM attributes were primarily directives to the browser about how to display a piece of markup. A great example of this is the colspan attribute:\n  colspan has semantic meaning to the browser and thus has to be parsed. Given that pages weren\u2019t very dynamic back then and attributes were generally treated like enums, IE created an attribute system that was optimized around eager parsing for use in formatting and layout.\n Today\u2019s app patterns, however, heavily use attributes like  id,  class, and  data-*, which are treated less like browser directives and more like generic storage:\n  Thus, we\u2019re deferring most work beyond the bare minimum necessary to store the string. Additionally, since UI frameworks often encourage  repeated CSS classes across elements, we plan to  atomize strings to reduce memory usage and improve performance in APIs like  querySelector.\n Though we still have plenty of work planned, with Windows 10 Creators Update, we\u2019re happy to share that we\u2019ve made significant progress!\n  Reliably measuring and improving performance is  hard and the  pitfalls of  benchmarking are  well documented. To get the most holistic view of browser performance possible, the Microsoft Edge team uses a combination of user telemetry, controlled measurement real-world scenarios, and synthetic benchmarks to guide our optimizations.\n  User telemetry \u201cpaints with a broad brush\u201d, but by definition measures the most impactful work. Below is an example of our build-over-build tracking of the  firstChild API across our user base. This data isn\u2019t directly actionable, since it doesn\u2019t provide all the details of the API call (i.e. what shape and size is the DOM tree) needed for performance tuning, but it\u2019s the only direct measurement of the user\u2019s experience and can provide feedback for planning and retrospectives.\n  We highlighted our  Performance lab and the nitty-gritty details of measuring browser performance a while ago, and while the tests themselves and the hardware in the lab has changed since then, the methodology is still relevant. By capturing and replaying real-world user scenarios in complex sites and apps like Bing Maps and Office 365, we\u2019re less likely to overinvest in narrowly applicable optimizations that don\u2019t benefit users. This graph is an example of our reports for a simulated user on Bing Maps. Each data point is a build of the browser, and hovering provides details about the statistical distribution of measurements and links to more information for investigating changes.\n  Our Performance lab\u2019s fundamental responsibility is to provide the repeatability necessary to test and evaluate code changes and implementation options. That repeatability also serves as the platform for synthetic benchmarks.\n In the benchmark category, our most exciting improvement is in  Speedometer. Speedometer simulates using the  TodoMVC app for several popular web frameworks including Ember, Backbone, jQuery, Angular, and React. With the new DOM tree in place and other improvements across other browser subsystems like the Chakra JavaScript engine, the time to run the Speedometer benchmark decreased by 30%; in the Creators update, our performance focus netted another improvement of 35% (note that Speedometer\u2019s scores are a measure of speed and thus an  inverse function of time).\n  Of course the most important performance metric is the user\u2019s perception, so while totally unscientific, we\u2019ve been super excited to see others notice our work!\n   kudos to Microsoft, latest Edge version is nearly 50% faster on  https://t.co/KFX8Y4SpDI (and now crushes Firefox)\n  Latest Edge also 2x faster for Ember. Finally, some change I can believe in! Good work Edge team. ????  pic.twitter.com/nj6Qld4aTW\n  We\u2019re not done yet, and we know that Microsoft Edge is not yet the fastest on the Speedometer benchmark. Our score will continue to improve as a side effect of our performance work and we\u2019ll keep the dev community updated on our progress.\n  A fast DOM is critical for today\u2019s web apps and experiences. Windows 10 Creators Update is the first of a series of releases focused on performance on top of a re-architected DOM tree. At the same time, we\u2019ll continue to improve our performance telemetry and community resources like the  CSS usage and  API catalog.\n We\u2019re just beginning to scratch the surface of what\u2019s possible with our new DOM tree, and there\u2019s still a long journey ahead, but we\u2019re excited to see where it leads and to share it with you!

He had been married to his wife, Abigail, for more than twenty years. The medical students who performed the autopsy declared Allen\u2019s body anatomically female, but the coroner continued to call the deceased \u2018he\u2019 because \u2018I considered it impossible for him to be a woman, as he had a wife.\u2019 The marriage certificate convinced the coroner to ignore Allen\u2019s anatomy: social gender trumped biological gender. The rest of the community agreed. Allen wore trousers, worked as a manual labourer, had a wife and was called James. He was \u2018sober, steady, strong and active\u2019. Of course he was a man. Only after Allen\u2019s death, as news of the autopsy spread, did some people begin to express different opinions: they\u2019d always noticed his lack of facial hair, they said, and oddly high voice. But, even then, for every person who feminised Allen in retrospect, another insisted on his masculine traits \u2013 a face roughened by a life spent outdoors, large hands hardened by decades of work as a groom and sawyer.\n As Jen Manion\u2019s  Female Husbands and Rachel Mesch\u2019s  Before Trans show, a considerable number of people assigned female at birth lived as men, between genders, and outside gender during the 18th and 19th centuries \u2013 long before the rise of endocrinology and gender affirmation surgery. The people documented in these books were rich and poor, rural and urban, fixed and itinerant, literate and illiterate, French, British and American. Some had sex with men, some with women, some with both, some with no one at all. Almost all were white and, Manion shows, on the rare occasions when journalists and police did interact with trans people of colour, they focused on race. Femininity was so bound up with whiteness that a black woman who passed as a man was not seen to be making as great a gender leap as a white woman who did so. And because blackness was associated with enslavement, what white people noticed most about a black female sailor, say, was not that a woman had taken on a man\u2019s role but that an African American had exercised an unusual degree of freedom.\n As the title  Before Trans suggests, Mesch doesn\u2019t use \u2018trans\u2019 to refer to her book\u2019s three French gender-nonconformists, although they sometimes used masculine titles and pronouns. Mesch refers to them as \u2018she\u2019 throughout, arguing that none fully renounced the use of female pronouns, even as they sought to defy the rules imposed by the obsessively gendered French language. \u2018They\u2019, now widely adopted as a singular pronoun by individuals who combine or move between genders, seems to me the more appropriate choice for these figures. Because Manion\u2019s female husbands chose to live as men, I refer to them using male pronouns.\n Mesch\u2019s first subject, Jane Dieulafoy (b. 1851), was a French patriot, a Catholic, an archaeologist and a sharpshooter in the Franco-Prussian War. They were married to the engineer and archaeologist Marcel-Auguste Dieulafoy and together the couple undertook a number of expeditions to Persia. Their \u2018common dress\u2019 reflected their common interests (one journalist wrote that Dieulafoy\u2019s male attire enabled \u2018man and wife\u2019 to enjoy \u2018unbroken companionship\u2019). Joan of Arc served as inspiration and precedent, legitimising the expansion of \u2018femininity\u2019 to include defending the nation, but Dieulafoy\u2019s activities included the modest as well as the epic: writing novels about women warriors and designing gender-neutral costumes for amateur theatrics.\n The novelist Rachilde, born Marguerite Eymery in 1860, also made use of an external authority to gain a degree of gender autonomy. Aged sixteen, they claimed to be possessed by the spirit of Rachilde, a 17th-century Swedish count, and soon afterwards began to wear men\u2019s clothes and ordered calling cards printed with \u2018Man of Letters\u2019. Rachilde, Mesch writes, was \u2018never entirely sure\u2019 of their identity, but \u2018had long been sure\u2019 they were not a woman. Raoule, the protagonist of  Monsieur V\u00e9nus (1884) , Rachilde\u2019s most famous novel, alternates between male and female dress and becomes a female husband to an effeminate young man. Asked to account for the book by the Paris police, Rachilde described it as a tale about a woman who sexually penetrates men, \u2018noting that anything was possible with the help of technology\u2019. They stopped wearing trousers after marrying Alfred Vallette in 1889, but continued to respond to both \u2018Monsieur\u2019 and \u2018Madame\u2019.\n Mesch\u2019s third subject, the art critic Marc de Montifaud (1845-1912), born Marie-Am\u00e9lie Chartroule de Montifaud, rejected gender categories altogether, insisting on a radical individualism: not \u2018he\u2019 or \u2018she\u2019 but \u2018I am me.\u2019 Montifaud used both male and female pronouns and took male and female lovers; after they married, both partners went by \u2018Monsieur Montifaud\u2019. Montifaud\u2019s salacious short stories weren\u2019t safe from French obscenity laws, however, and resulted in prison sentences, confinement in asylums and temporary flights into exile.\n Mesch\u2019s gender renegades were wealthy and educated, so records of their inner lives survive. They wrote memoirs, letters and novels, commissioned portraits and compiled scrapbooks. By contrast, Manion\u2019s working-class British and American subjects rarely had much control over the way they were represented by journalists and balladeers. Most female husbands made the news only after something went wrong in their lives. Some were blackmailed while others were exposed after falling ill or getting arrested.\n Female husbands expressed their masculinity through their choice of clothing, names, behaviours and, above all, their labour and their marriage status. As tavern keepers, soldiers, sailors, mountebanks, builders and itinerant tinkers, they rejected the belief that those born female couldn\u2019t do men\u2019s work. Husbands were not born, but made. Because most people believed that marriage could exist only between a man and woman, having a wife was just as convincing a proof of manhood as physical strength, a long stride and a tendency to drink too much and get into fights.\n Some female husbands remained in stable unions for decades. Others, revealed to have been born female, moved to new places and continued to live as men, or were forced to dissolve their marriages, in some cases resuming female attire. The way women responded to their female husbands varied with the state of their relationships. Some wives pressed charges. In 1838, Henry Stoake, an oven builder from Manchester who had lived as a man since his late teens, was exposed by his wife of 22 years. Angry that he was holding back her housekeeping allowance, she sought a legal separation and tried to secure a claim to his assets by telling her lawyer that Stoake had been born female. (In fact, her revelation cast doubt on whether she was legally married at all.) Other wives stood by female husbands who ended up on the wrong side of the law. When George Wilson was arrested for vagrancy after fainting in a New York street in 1836 (there wasn\u2019t yet a crime of dressing as the other sex to charge him with), Elisabeth, his wife of fifteen years, fetched him from the police station to the house the couple shared with her father. Samuel Bundy, born Sarah Paul, a sailor, was jailed in 1760 on a charge of fraud for marrying a woman (his initial defence was that a shark had eaten his penis). Bundy was reportedly visited in prison by a dozen women to whom he had paid court; his wife refused to press charges and eventually he was released. Nine months later, living as a woman, Bundy married a man.\n Female husbands troubled their communities because they proved it wasn\u2019t always straightforward to tell men and women apart, despite the notion of \u2018opposite sexes\u2019. The consequences of this unease could be severe. In 1746, Charles Hamilton, an itinerant quack doctor in the southwest of England, was reported to the authorities by his wife of two months for \u2018pretending herself a man\u2019. He was publicly whipped in four different towns, then sentenced to six months\u2019 hard labour. (By the time Hamilton\u2019s story surfaced in a Boston newspaper, he was reported to have had fourteen wives.) But many female husbands were supported by their communities, and press coverage could be sympathetic. James Howe began to live as a man in 1732, aged sixteen, and had been married for thirty years before his desperation at being blackmailed by a childhood acquaintance led him to reveal his secret. After his friends and neighbours learned that Howe had been born female, they took the news in their stride. The blackmailer was sentenced to four years in prison for extortion. A widely circulated account of the trial, Manion notes, portrayed Howe as \u2018a person of integrity \u2013 despite their gender ambiguity\u2019.\n Female husbands had varied relationships to masculinity. Some transitioned to maleness early in adolescence, others much later; some lived as men for most of their lives, some only briefly and others moved between genders. In 1852, 17-year-old Mary Robins met the 32-year-old Mrs Panton, who claimed to be an illegitimate royal \u2013 born male but forced to disguise himself as female to avoid scandal. Mrs Panton dropped that disguise to wed Mary Robins as Albert Guelph. During the honeymoon, Mary learned that Albert was the mother of three children, and the marriage was annulled. Guelph resurfaced four years later in Syracuse, New York, when the father of his next bride reported him to the authorities, this time against his daughter\u2019s wishes.\n In both these books, gender has more to do with habit than biology. According to Manion, female husbands knew that \u2018what makes a man is not the sex they are assigned at birth but the life they live.\u2019 In the  Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle argued for a form of knowledge he called practical: one learns to become a swimmer by swimming. One might say that a person becomes a man by living as a man. Mesch proposes that gender isn\u2019t a label so much as a story, although judging by these accounts, it\u2019s not just one story but many. The stories trans people told about themselves often collided with the way others understood them. Family members, neighbours, employers, spouses, lovers, police officers and doctors could make or unmake the tale and the teller.\n Trans people encounter resistance not only because they challenge widely held notions about gender but also because they threaten society\u2019s conformist tendencies. Dieulafoy, for example, found much more acceptance than Rachilde, because Dieulafoy\u2019s masculinity served the French imperial state. The press lauded them as an \u2018intrepid explorer\u2019 whose Persian expeditions added treasures to the Louvre. The same holds true for some of Manion\u2019s female husbands. Robert Shurtliff, an American soldier in the War of Independence, also known as Deborah Sampson, was celebrated for acting out of the \u2018purest patriotism\u2019 and without \u2018any selfish motives\u2019. When the British soldier James Gray revealed that he had once been Hannah Snell, he was treated as a hero. By contrast, the deliberately perverse Rachilde, determined \u2018to be strange or nothing at all\u2019, was denounced, censored and pathologised. When a judge found Albert Guelph guilty of vagrancy in 1856, he claimed that he had \u2018harmed the entire community\u2019.\n As society\u2019s ideas about gender changed, so too did attitudes towards female husbands. After the rise of feminism in the 1840s, female husbands became associated with the growing numbers of women eager to vote, go to college and work in jobs formerly reserved for men. The press began to fret that a once eccentric phenomenon might soon become widespread. In 1883, the  New York Times announced that \u2018many women \u2026 if they had the opportunity, would select other women as husbands rather than marry men.\u2019 Although reports of female husbands remained rare, agitation about gender-crossing intensified. With the rise of sexology in the 1880s, doctors and journalists began to see female husbands as lesbians, that is, as more female than husband. Sex, now considered a fixed biological essence, began to trump gender: no longer a person successfully living as a man, the female husband was a deviant woman.\n Then as now, conservatives feared that the many would follow the few. In 1837, a religious conservative in Boston warned that what Manion calls \u2018transing\u2019 might \u2018become universal\u2019. In the 1860s, US states and cities began to enact laws that made it a crime for women to dress as men and men as women. If there was no widespread hysteria about trans people using public toilets, it was only because there were so few public toilets. Those that did exist were indeed sites of gender trouble. In 1870, for example, Fanny (n\u00e9e Frederick) Park and Stella (n\u00e9e Thomas) Boulton were arrested for disturbing the peace, then charged with conspiracy to commit sodomy, after using the Ladies\u2019 Retiring Room in a London theatre.\n Mesch and Manion correctly point out that feminist and lesbian scholars long disregarded or downplayed the self-definitions of people who had spent their lives insisting they were not women. Mesch cites Rachilde\u2019s assertion that they were \u2018not a feminist\u2019 because they were \u2018not a woman\u2019. But the zeal with which Mesch and Manion take those scholars to task suggests that they believe lesbians and feminists to be especially hostile to trans existence. This is a view shared by many young people, who associate the term \u2018lesbian\u2019 with transphobic ideas about who is and is not a woman. It is far more common, however, for feminist organisations and individuals to support transgender rights. In 2019, more than seventy self-identified UK women\u2019s rights advocates signed a letter distancing themselves from trans exclusionary activists. All the major feminist organisations in Iceland supported a 2019 law that allows people to legally change their gender without a medical diagnosis and created an option for a third gender on all official documents. The tensions among some lesbians, feminists, trans people and their supporters are real. But these groups also have common enemies and shared goals, beginning with liberating us all from the relentless gender policing that begins before birth.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 14:51:38",

pointed out that we\u2019re missing a step-by-step guide on how to go from an idea, to hardware, to a fully implemented feature in Xous for Precursor. So, here it is.\n Because Precursor uses an FPGA for its SoC, we can add new features to the hardware \u201con the fly\u201d. In this case, we\u2019re going to add some improvements to our basic managed TRNG block. To review, the existing TRNG consists of an  avalanche noise source and a  ring oscillator noise source as hardware-based sources of \u201ctrue\u201d entropy. Two generators are used for the following reasons:\n An external discrete generator is easy to check (just put an oscilloscope on the avalanche noise source), but harder to protect against physical access attacks\n An integrated, on-chip generator is harder to hack (more robust against a pair of tweezers executing a short-to-ground attack, or RF interference attacks), but harder to check (is the data from the TRNG, or merely a decoy CSPRNG implant?)\n All hardware mechanisms are fallible; having two sources improves robustness against transient drop-outs or aging failures\n We\u2019ve already done extensive, months-long characterization of both of the TRNG sources and found them to produce passable raw entropy. However, the system is still missing two features that are generally considered to be best practice:\n Independent, on-line health monitors of the raw TRNG outputs. It\u2019s important that the health monitoring happens before any conditioning or mixing of the raw data happens, and significantly, there is no one-size-fits-all health monitor for a TRNG: it\u2019s advised ( NIST SP 800-90B sec 4.4) to have tests that are tailored to the noise source.\n Conditioning of the raw data. Despite best efforts to make TRNGs unbiased and flawless, they are really hard to get right. Furthermore, they are only capable of producing high-quality entropy at a limited data rate. Thus, most practical systems take a TRNG output and run it through a cryptographic stream cipher to generate a final datastream; this simultaneously protects against minor flaws in the TRNG while improving the availability of random numbers.\n The following lengthy posts walk step-by-step through the thought process, implementation and debugging process of adding these features. Few people would even notice these features, and if everything is doing its job right (that is, the TRNG\u2019s raw data is working correctly) is indistinguishable from the state before all this effort. However, we take TRNGs seriously here; so much rides on the quality of these random numbers that it\u2019s probably worth the effort to harden them against failures, be they unintentional, malicious, or just design bugs.\n I have to be honest, I spent a lot of time to check a box that few people care about, but I\u2019ve come to realize that\u2019s mainly what writing OS code and firmware is about. You can get more fame and dopamine from creating a cool UI theme with an afternoon of work. It\u2019s also really hard to explain to everyday people what you\u2019re doing exactly with all this time and effort; but without the underlying frameworks that make things durable and reliable, we all might as well be drawing chalk pictures on the side walk.\n Without further ado, here are the two guides for adding features, there\u2019s some repetition between the posts so they can be read independently.\n  I\u2019ll also take highlights from these wiki articles and repost them to the blog here, creating a \u201cTL;DR\u201d version that is also neatly delivered to the inboxes of my blog\u2019s email subscribers.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 14:47:00", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u524d\u4f53,precursor,trng", "title": "\u5347\u7ea7\u524d\u4f53\u7684TRNG ", "title_en": "Upgrading Precursor\u2019s TRNG", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=6094", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u524d\u4f53", "precursor", "trng"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067148, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters", "note_en": "It was early June in 1987 when Richard Stallman announced the release of the GNU C compiler version 1.0. As I wrote in  Open Sources, it was the most thrilling and most terrifying day of my life (up to that point). Having first read and lightly hacked Emacs code in 1985, having read and lightly hacked GDB code in 1986, I eagerly attended a week-long lecture series on Emacs Stallman gave in Febrary 1987 at MCC in Austin Texas. By day, my appreciation for Stallman and the GNU project grew as I as I began to understand the depth of his technical designs, the beauty of his implementation approaches and the method by which both were protected  for me instead of  from me by the GPL. By night, my curiosity grew as Stallman would steal moments between lectures and especially at the end of the day to hack on a project he was not yet ready to disclose.By the end of the week in February the secret had been revealed to me: he was working on a C compiler and was in the final stages of polishing the optimizer. I was 22 years old at the time, and I still harbored a dream that I might someday write &#34;The Great American Compiler&#34;. I was thrilled to have a chance to see how a master like Stallman would write such a thing, and I was terrified that I would never create something worthy of recognition if he had been there first. When Stallman announced version 1.0, 20 years ago to this day (more or less), I had a decision to make: I could join him, I could compete with him, or I could pick a new dream. I downloaded GCC version 1.0 and began a collaboration that would last for ten years (when, due to RSI, I gave up programming as a mainstream activity.)GCC version 1.0 was a watershed event in my life. The first day I was intent on just learning how it worked--the parser, the lexical analyzer, the intermediate code generator, the optimizers, and the machine-dependent assembly output routines. I printed all the files (consuming three reams of paper) and proceeded to lay them out in piles across my extra-large dining table and any other horizontal surfaces I could see from my central position. I brought out the colored pencils I&#39;d used when learning the art and science of integrated circuit design (red for polycilicon, green for n-diffusion, blue for metal, yellow for n-well, and black for vias and contacts) and gave the colors new meanings to track data, code, and other relationships relevant to compilers. After five days and nights, something &#34;clicked&#34; and I no longer needed the printouts--the data structures and basic organization suddenly became &#34;obvious&#34;. I put away the pencils and began to itch with the desire to hack GCC, and not lightly.I decided to take the next step--to write a completely new port of the compiler to a microprocessor that had always fascinated me: the National Semiconductor 32032. I already had the manual from my days at the Moore School of Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, and so I began the process of replacing templates used for the VAX and Motorola 68020 processors with templates appropriate for the National chip. I immediately ran into problems--but they were small problems and easily fixed. I had GCC generating code for the National chip within a few days, and I had it generating correct code a few days after that.When I did this work, the typical compiler company charged millions of dollars for the service of delivering a compiler in 12-18 months, and sometimes longer. Two weeks to the day after I downloaded the compiler from the Free Software Foundation, I had it generating code that was 20% faster that the code coming from the National compiler. If I compared the $3000/month salary I earned at the time with what these companies charged, I delivered a product that was 20% better (6-9 months in Moore&#39;s Law time) for 1/1000th the cost in 1/30th the time. It was a heck of a 23rd birthday present to myself!Within hours of posting an announcement of this new port, it became obvious to me and to others that there were many optimizations I had not yet implemented. After another two weeks of work, I was generated code that was 40% faster than the National compiler. 40% was an important number because the 32032 was marketed as a &#34;1 MIPS&#34; chip (meaning able to execute one million instructions per second), but it only benchmarked at 0.75 MIPS and was headed for commercial irrelevancy. With my 32032 port, the chip benchmarked above 1 MIPS, proving to me that the hardware guys had delivered, but the software guys had not. I also realized that even in 1987, there were already sufficiently many people to make a collaborative process very successful.I went on to write many other ports that summer, demonstrating with remarkable consistency that by hacking on GNU, I could routinely generate better product faster than whole teams of compiler-writers employed by much larger companies. By the end of that year I went on to achieve a new goal, which was to write the GNU C++ compiler. To me, GNU C++ was &#34;The Great American C++ Compiler&#34;, a new, improved version of my original goal. And because I benefited so much, both by what others shared with me before I started hacking, and by the helpful suggestions and bugfixes I received after I started hacking, I, too, shared freely the knowledge I had gained. I wrote and delivered the first comprehensive training on the GNU compiler internals, giving my 100+ LaTeX slides to Stallman so he, too, could earn money by teaching others how to hack.
