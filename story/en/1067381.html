The colored circles represent the positions of the candidates and voters in some abstract space. Imagine that the Y axis measures how focused the candidate is on environmental protection, and the X axis measures their position on some other issue like corporate tax rates. Voters prefer candidates that are closer to them. Clicking anywhere on this diagram simulates a new election where the average voter is where you clicked. What that means is that if we averaged together the positions of all of the voters they would be at that point, but if you click on the same point a few times you’ll see that the position of each voter can change.</p><p>  该图显示了单一选举。彩色圆圈代表候选人和选民在一些抽象空间中的位置。想象一下，Y轴衡量候选人在环境保护上的重点是如何聚焦，X轴衡量其对公司税率等其他问题的位置。选民更喜欢更接近他们的候选人。单击此图中的任意位置模拟了一个新的选举，其中普通选民是您单击的位置。这意味着，如果我们在那一点上平均所有选民的位置，但如果你点击同一个点几次，你会看到每个选民的位置可以改变。</p><p> Looking at one simulated election doesn’t tell us very much, so we’ll use something called a  Yee diagram to show how the results vary over many simulated elections depending on where the average voter is.</p><p> 看着一个模拟的选举并没有告诉我们，所以我们将使用称为Yee图的东西来展示结果如何在许多模拟选举中变化，具体取决于平均选民的位置。</p><p> The US presidential election in 2000 was historic, partially because Ralph Nader chose to ignore those incentives. It was expected to be a tight race between George W Bush and Al Gore, but Nader was running as a third party candidate. Leading up to the election, a group of self identified “Naders Raiders” wrote an open letter to Nader asking him to drop out. They were worried that he would be handing the election to Bush.</p><p> 2000年美国总统选举是历史性的，部分原因是拉尔夫·纳伯选择忽视这些激励措施。预计将成为乔治W布什和戈尔之间的紧张种族，但纳米队正在作为第三方候选人竞选。领导选举，一群自我确定的“纳撒突袭者”写了一个令人鸣叫的公开信，要求他辍学。他们担心他将把选举送到布什。</p><p> It is now clear that you might well give the White House to Bush. As a result, you would set back significantly the social progress to which you have devoted your entire, astonishing career. You have sacrificed for the benefit of the common good your entire adult life… It would be a cruel irony indeed if your major legacy were to erase the victory from the candidate who most embodies your philosophy, Al Gore, and to give the Executive Branch to the party which has consistently resisted your progressive ideals.  1</p><p> 现在很清楚，你可能会让白宫给布什。因此，您将大大重新启动您致力于整个令人惊讶的职业的社交进展。为了让整个成年生活的共同善良的利益，你牺牲了......这确实是一个残酷的讽刺，如果你的主要遗产是从最多最多体现你的哲学，戈尔的候选人的胜利，并给行政部门一贯抵制你的进步理想的党。 1</p><p> Carl Pope, the president of the Sierra Club, pleaded with Nader to reconsider his campaign strategy.</p><p> 塞拉克俱乐部总裁卡尔教皇恳求纳米人重新考虑他的竞选战略。 </p><p> You pledged you would not campaign as a spoiler and would avoid the swing states. Your recent campaign rhetoric and campaign schedule make it clear that you have broken this pledge… Irresponsible as I find your strategy, I accept that you genuinely believe in it. Please accept that I, and the overwhelming majority of the environmental movement in this country, genuinely believe that your strategy is flawed, dangerous, and reckless.  2</p><p>你承诺你不会作为扰流板竞选，并避免摇摆状态。您最近的竞选言论和竞选计划明确表示您已经折断了这一质量......不负责任，因为我找到了你的策略，我接受了你真正相信它。请接受这个国家的绝大多数环境运动，真正相信您的策略有缺陷，危险和鲁莽。 2</p><p> The Republican Leadership Council ran campaign ads featuring Nader, believing that the more people that voted for Nader, the better chance Bush had at winning the election.</p><p> The Republican Leadership Council ran campaign ads featuring Nader, believing that the more people that voted for Nader, the better chance Bush had at winning the election.</p><p> Nader, running a low-budget campaign, is not airing any television commercials of his own and it’s possible that the RLC will end up spending more on pro-Nader media that Nader himself.  3</p><p> 纳迪尔，运营低预算活动，并不播出他自己的电视广告，并且rlc可能最终在纳多人自己的亲纳米媒体上花费更多。 3.</p><p> Why were environmentalists, relatively ideolically similar to Nader, pleading with him not to run? Why were republicans trying to get people to vote for one of their opponents? All of these people believed that votes for Nader would have the effect of electing Bush, because of something known as the  spoiler effect.</p><p> 为什么环保主义者，相对透明的与纳米相似，恳求他不跑？为什么共和党人试图让人们投票给他们的一个对手？所有这些人都认为纳米的选票将具有选举灌木的效果，因为所谓的扰流效果。</p><p>  This visualization is called a  Yee diagram. The background is colored based on who would win if the average voter was at that point. If there is a tie, the background will be grey; the black line just gives us a sense of where the middle is.</p><p>  这种可视化称为YEE图。如果普通选民在那一点，背景是基于谁赢的。如果有一个领带，背景将是灰色的;黑线只是让我们有一种中间的意义。</p><p> The diagram is generated by simulating an election for each cell of the background, where the voters are randomly distributed around that cell. I would expect an ideal voting method to elect the candidate closest to any given cell.</p><p> 通过模拟背景的每个小区的选举来生成图，其中选民随机分布在该小区周围。我希望理想的投票方式将最接近任何给定细胞的候选人选出。</p><p> These diagrams don’t tell us very much about any individual election, but they can help us explore how elections are shaped by the voting method that we choose. In the 2000 election, all ballots were counted using a method called  plurality voting, where each voter picks their favorite candidate and the candidate with the most votes wins. In some sense, plurality voting asks voters which candidate they are most in favor of, but doesn’t ask anything about what they think of the rest of the candidates. This makes it hard for plurality elections to find compromises.</p><p> 这些图表并不是对我们的任何选举都非常联系我们，但他们可以帮助我们探索选举如何通过我们选择的投票方式来塑造。在2000年选举中，使用称为多项投票的方法计算所有选票，每个选民选择他们最喜欢的候选人和最多投票的候选人。在某种意义上，多次投票要求他们最有利的候选者的选民，但并​​没有问他们对其其余候选人的看法。这使得多个选举难以找到妥协。 </p><p> If only Bush and Gore had been running, the race would have been simple, the winner would be whoever was closer to the center of public opinion. But strange things start to happen when we consider Nader.</p><p>如果只有布什和戈尔一直在奔跑，比赛本来就是简单的，胜利者将是靠近舆论中心的人。但是当我们考虑纳了人时，奇怪的事情就会开始发生。</p><p>  Because Nader is ideologically closer to Gore, voters are more likely to switch to Nader from Gore than to Nader from Bush. Depending on where we believe the average voter is this might not matter, but if we think that public opinion is somewhere between Bush and Gore, this is very likely to help Bush win. In that situation, plurality voting is unable to identify that for many voters (like Carl Pope and Naiders Raiders for Gore), Gore is a compromise between Nader and Bush. This is the spoiler effect that environmentalists were afraid of, and why republicans wanted to amplify Naders message.</p><p>  因为纳米是思想偏好于戈尔，因此选民更有可能从血腥切换到八分之一。取决于我们相信普通选民的地方可能无关紧要，但如果我们认为舆论是布什和戈尔之间的某个地方，这可能有可能帮助布什赢。在这种情况下，多次投票无法识别许多选民（如Carl Pope和裸女掠夺者的雷戈尔），戈尔是纳米和灌木之间的折衷。这是环保主义者害怕的剧透，以及为什么共和党人想要放大纳米讯。</p><p> The lesson many people take from the spoiler effect is that third party candidates harm the platforms they care about, but the spoiler effect doesn’t happen in every voting system. While there are versions of this effect in plurality voting and in  instant runoff voting, other systems like  approval voting don’t have this issue.</p><p> 许多人从剧透效应中取出的课程是第三方候选人损害了他们关心的平台，但剧透效应不会发生在每个投票系统中。虽然多个投票中存在这种效果的版本，并且在即时径流投票中，其他系统，如批准投票，但其他系统没有这个问题。</p><p> Approval voting ballots look very similar to plurality voting ballots, but voting involves selecting as many of the candidates as you would like rather than only your favorite. If plurality voting is asking voters who their favorite candidate is, approval voting is asking who voters would accept as the winner. The structure of that question gives us more of the information we need to identify compromises. The diagram below shows the dynamics of the same set of candidates, but in an election run with approval voting.   4</p><p> 批准表决选票看起来非常类似于多种投票的选票，但投票涉及选择尽可能多的候选人，而不是只有您的最爱。如果多次投票要求选民是他们最喜欢的候选人，批准投票是询问谁选民将接受作为胜利者。该问题的结构为我们提供了更多我们需要识别妥协的信息。下图显示了同一组候选人的动态，而是在选举中进行批准投票。 4.</p><p>  Approval voting has an important property; if a candidate doesn’t win the race, they don’t affect the results. You can see this in the above diagram; moving candidate A around can change a cell from B to A, but it never changes any cell from B to C. Try moving Nader around, and watch the line between Bush and Gore. That line never moves, other than in areas that Nader now wins.</p><p>  批准投票具有重要的财产;如果候选人没有赢得比赛，他们不会影响结果。您可以在上图中看到这一点;候选候选人A周围可以将小区从B改变为a，但它永远不会将任何小区从B从B到C.尝试移动吊带，观看丛林和血腥之间的线路。除了现在赢得胜利的地区，这条线永远不会移动。</p><p> In the 2000 election, this stability property would have meant that republicans wouldn’t have had any reason to encourage people to vote for one of their opponents. Environmentalists might have welcomed another candidate fighting for environmental justice, because voters who cared about the environment wouldn’t have to choose between Gore and Nader. Approval voting would give them a way to express that they were ok with either one.</p><p> 在2000年选举中，这种稳定性属性将意味着共和党人不会有理由鼓励人们投票给他们的一个对手。环保主义者可能会欢迎另一个候选人为环境司法争夺，因为关心环境的选民不必在戈尔和纳米之间进行选择。批准投票会给他们一种表达他们对任何一种的方式。</p><p> For a long time the US has treated plurality voting as the only option, but that is changing. Voters in Fargo and St. Louis restructured their elections to use approval voting, and voters in  San Francisco,  Austin,  Seattle,  Missouri, and  Utah are working to change how they vote as well. You might soon have an opportunity to choose how your government is elected. What do you want your voting system to encourage?</p><p> 很长一段时间，美国将多项投票视为唯一的选项，但这正在发生变化。法戈和圣路易斯的选民重组他们的选举使用批准投票，以及旧金山，奥斯汀，西雅图，密苏里州和犹他州的选民正在努力改变他们的投票方式。 You might soon have an opportunity to choose how your government is elected.您希望您的投票系统鼓励什么？ </p><p> Approval voting has another parameter that we don’t have to think about in the context of plurality voting; how accepting are you? The less accepting you are, the more likely you are to only vote for one candidate, or to refuse to vote at all. The more accepting you are, the more likely you are to be ok with every candidate, and therefore indifferent to the outcome. In the approval diagram, voters vote for anyone within a certain radius of them. While picking a radius that is very small or very large compared to the distribution of voters leads to some strange effects, in practice such behavior is unlikely. A very large radius would mean that most people are voting for every candidate, despite the fact that that means their vote is irrelevant. A very small radius would mean that most people refuse to vote at all unless the perfect candidate is running. ↩</p><p>批准投票有另一个参数，我们不必在多种投票的上下文中思考; 你有多接受？ 接受你的接受越少，你就越有可能投票给一名候选人，或者拒绝投票。 你越接受的是，每个候选人都越有可能，因此对结果无动于衷。 在批准图中，选民投票给他们某个半径内的任何人。 在与选民的分布相比，挑选一个非常小或非常大的半径导致一些奇怪的效果，在实践中，这种行为不太可能。 非常大的半径意味着大多数人都会为每个候选人投票，尽管这意味着他们的投票是无关紧要的。 非常小的半径意味着除非完美的候选人正在运行，否则大多数人都拒绝投票。 ↩ </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://schicks.github.io/posts/visualizing-voting-systems/">https://schicks.github.io/posts/visualizing-voting-systems/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/可视化/">#可视化</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/voting/">#voting</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/投票/">#投票</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
