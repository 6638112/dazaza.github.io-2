Carrying forged papers and false names, they were feared by peasants, shunned by burghers and hunted by the police. Catholics and Protestants, Jews, Sinti and Roma – they had little in common, neither bonds of religion nor ethnicity, except for the life into which they had drifted, the life of the road.</p><p>他们最初是作为学徒寻找大师，学生是寻找教师，还是士兵是寻找战争的士兵，但最终他们成为旅行的修补匠，小贩，乞be和小偷，是中欧地下巡逻的成员。他们携带伪造的文件和虚假的名字，受到农民的恐惧，被人们避开，被警察追捕。天主教徒和新教徒，犹太人，辛提人和罗姆人-他们没有共同点，既没有宗教或种族纽带，除了他们漂泊的生活和道路生活。</p><p> The underground of central Europe, from the Middle Ages to the modern era, is all but inaccessible to us today. Those wandering its roads left few traces of themselves, except for the secret signs they carved on trees to warn each other of aggressive policemen and rabid dogs, or to recommend kindhearted householders willing to provide bread and water. These markings faded but there remains a way to catch glimpses of this lost world: its language. Over the course of hundreds of years, the people of the road evolved a distinct way of talking that strengthened their resilience, fostered solidarity and helped them survive. As it was purely spoken, this language, too, almost disappeared – had it not been for police forces across central Europe that decoded it like the cipher used by enemy powers. Collaborating across jurisdictions from the Middle Ages to the 20th century, the police recorded this language by arresting its speakers and forcing them to divulge their words and phrases. The police also named it: Rotwelsch.</p><p> 从中世纪到现代时代，中欧的地下如今对我们几乎是无法到达的。那些漫步在道路上的人留下了很少的痕迹，除了他们刻在树上的秘密标志以互相警告好斗的警察和狂犬病的狗，或者推荐愿意提供面包和水的友善的家庭。这些标记消失了，但是仍然有办法瞥见这个迷失的世界：它的语言。在数百年的历程中，道路上的人们发展出一种独特的谈话方式，从而增强了他们的应变能力，促进了团结并帮助他们生存。纯粹是说这种语言，如果不是整个中欧的警察部队像敌人大国使用的密码那样对它进行解码的话，这种语言也几乎消失了。从中世纪到20世纪，在各个司法管辖区进行合作，警察通过逮捕说话者并强迫他们泄露其单词和短语来记录这种语言。警察也把它命名为：Rotwelsch。</p><p> Rot was a word for beggar (in Rotwelsch), and  welsch could mean Italian but mostly it meant foreign and incomprehensible. There was some truth in the name, because Rotwelsch speakers freely mixed German, Yiddish, Hebrew, Czech and Romani, the language of the Sinti and Roma (who used to be called Gypsies because they were falsely believed to have originated in Egypt) in ways that were incomprehensible to outsiders. To German or Yiddish speakers, it sounded as if Rotwelsch speakers had stolen words and twisted their meaning.</p><p> Rot是乞be的意思（在Rotwelsch中），welsch的意思是意大利语，但多数情况下是外国的和难以理解的意思。名称中有一些道理，因为Rotwelsch讲者以多种方式自由地将德语，意第绪语，希伯来语，捷克语和罗曼语，辛提语和罗姆语（以前被称为吉普赛人，因为他们被错误地认为起源于埃及）混合在一起这是局外人难以理解的。对于说德语或意第绪语的人来说，听起来好像Rotwelsch说话者的言语被盗并扭曲了含义。</p><p> Rotwelsch was a name for the language used not by the speakers themselves but by those who regarded vagrants as untrustworthy foreigners. While the police continued to believe that vagrants obscured their words deliberately to make it  welsch to outsiders, in reality these vagrants’ words were only as incomprehensible as any language is to those who don’t speak it. The true purpose of Rotwelsch was not to keep things secret but to help these outcasts navigate their daily lives and to create community among them. A second name captured this reality,  kochemer loshn, which, like many words in this language, came from Hebrew:  chokmah, for wisdom; and  loshn, for tongue or language. This name didn’t denounce the language as a beggar’s cant but celebrated it as a way of talking for those in the know, as the lingo of the wise guys.</p><p> Rotwelsch是这种语言的名称，不是说者自己使用的语言，而是那些认为流浪者是不可信任的外国人的语言。警察继续认为，流浪者故意使自己的言语模糊，以致使局外人很欢迎，但实际上，这些流浪者的话就像对任何不说这种语言的人一样难以理解。 Rotwelsch的真正目的不是要保密，而是要帮助这些流浪者过上日常生活并在其中建立社区。第二个名字捕捉到了这个现实，即kochemer loshn，它像希伯来语中的许多单词一样来自希伯来语：chokmah，代表智慧；和loshn，用于语言或语言。这个名字并没有谴责这种语言是乞be的轻率之举，而是以明智者的行话称赞它是一种为有识之士所说的话。</p><p> For Rotwelsch (or  kochemer loshn) speakers, who were in permanent flight from the law, there was little difference between trading and stealing, which is why they had a single word for both, as for traded and stolen goods: the Yiddish word  sore, meaning trouble, problem, calamity. Words for food, sex, and lice – an affliction of itinerants everywhere – abounded in their language, as did words for police and for getting arrested.</p><p> 对于经常逃避法律的Rotwelsch（或kochemer loshn）演讲者来说，交易和盗窃之间几乎没有区别，这就是为什么他们对交易和被盗商品都使用一个词：意第绪语词疮，意思是麻烦，问题，灾难。食物，性别和虱子（各地到处都是流动人口）的话在他们的语言中比比皆是，警察和被捕的话也很多。</p><p>  The worst that could happen was being sent to  school, which meant going to prison, a phrase adapted from the German  Schule (school), which had been transformed into the Yiddish word for synagogue. (Calling prison ‘school’ later became common in the American underground and was used, most recently, in Martin Scorsese’s film  The Irishman). The 19th-century policeman Friedrich Avé-Lallemant, the first true scholar of Rotwelsch, would have much to say about this equation of school and prison. He studied Rotwelsch and its speakers, and drew a single lesson from the experience: the necessity for police reform.</p><p>  可能发生的最坏情况是被送往学校，这意味着要去监狱，这是从德国舒勒（学校）改编而成的短语，该短语已被翻译成意第绪语的犹太教堂。 （后来称为“学校”的监狱在美国地下很常见，最近在马丁·斯科塞斯（Martin Scorsese）的电影《爱尔兰人》中被使用。 19世纪的警察FriedrichAvé-Lallemant是Rotwelsch的第一位真正的学者，他对学校和监狱的等式有很多话要说。他研究了Rotwelsch及其发言人，并从经验中学到了一个教训：进行警察改革的必要性。</p><p> To avoid being sent to school, Rotwelsch speakers had to cultivate the art of  making a rabbit, by which they meant how best to make like a rabbit and dash off.</p><p> 为了避免被送往学校，Rotwelsch的演讲者必须培养制作兔子的艺术，这意味着如何最好地像兔子一样制作并冲刺。 </p><p> This witty and wise language, which mistrusted big words and official institutions, expressed with poetic precision what it was like to live in difficult circumstances, of  being in a pickle. But why a pickle? Actually, the whole phrase was a misunderstanding, a false translation from Rotwelsch. The original Yiddish phrase ( Zores und Jokreszeit) had nothing to do with pickles, only sounded like them (to German ears, like  Saure Gurkenzeit, or ‘pickled cucumber time’), so that German speakers mistakenly started talking of pickles when they were in trouble. Before long, the phrase entered English, which means that you, too, dear reader, have been speaking Rotwelsch without realising it.</p><p>这种谐而睿智的语言不信任大词和官方机构，用诗般的精确表达了在困难的环境中生活的感觉，即处于咸菜中。但是为什么要泡菜呢？实际上，整个短语是一个误解，是Rotwelsch的错误翻译。最初的意第绪语（Zores und Jokreszeit）与泡菜无关，只听起来像它们（对德国人的耳朵，如Saure Gurkenzeit或“腌黄瓜时间”），因此，德语使用者误以为在泡菜时就开始谈论泡菜。麻烦。不久之后，该短语输入了英语，这意味着亲爱的读者您也一直在讲Rotwelsch，而没有意识到。</p><p> Ferdinand Baumhauer was one of the Rotwelsch speakers whose life is reconstructed in my recent  book. Born in 1818 into a family of cotton weavers, Baumhauer had apprenticed himself to a cobbler at 13, and a few years later begun the customary stint as a journeyman, hoping to learn from other masters of the trade. But Baumhauer quarrelled with another apprentice and left his position. Seeking cheap accommodation for the night, he chanced upon a shelter favoured by tramps, his first contact with the secret world of the road. Something about them appealed to him. Perhaps he was tired of having to serve masters who were often strict and abusive. He decided to quit his life as a journeyman and begin the more precarious one as a vagrant.</p><p> 费迪南德·鲍姆豪厄（Ferdinand Baumhauer）是Rotwelsch演讲者之一，他的生活在我最近的书中得到了重建。鲍姆豪威尔（Baumhauer）于1818年出生在一个棉织工家庭中，后来在13岁时成为一名鞋匠的学徒，几年后，他开始了作为行家的习惯，希望向其他贸易大师学习。但是鲍姆豪尔与另一名学徒发生争执，离开了职位。在寻找廉价住宿的夜晚，他偶然发现了一个受到流浪者青睐的庇护所，这是他第一次接触这条道路的秘密世界。关于他们的东西吸引了他。也许他已经厌倦了不得不为那些经常严厉和侮辱性的主人服务。他决定放弃自己的职业生涯，开始更加游刃有余的游民生活。</p><p> When Baumhauer was arrested many years later, the police realised that he had an unusual skill for a vagrant: he was a good scribe, thanks to years of forging papers. The police asked him to write down scenes from life in the underground. Baumhauer complied, filling a book with scenes of vagrancy written in his underground language. Baumhauer was the perfect informant, a vagrant with good penmanship. He even provided the decryption key – the meanings of secret words – on the right-hand side of each page and added helpful information at the bottom in the form of footnotes, aware of how little the police would know about the life he was describing.</p><p> 鲍姆豪尔（Baumhauer）多年后被捕时，警察意识到他对流浪者具有非同寻常的技能：由于多年的伪造文件，他是一个出色的抄写员。警察要求他写下地下生活的场景。鲍姆豪尔（Bauhmauer）遵从，用地下语言写的流浪场面填满了书。鲍姆豪尔（Bauhmauer）是完美的线人，具有出色的笔法流浪汉。他甚至在每页的右侧提供了解密密钥（即秘密词的含义），并在底部以脚注的形式添加了有用的信息，因为他知道警方对他所描述的生活知之甚少。</p><p>  He wrote of a family led by Walter and his wife, known as Walteress, making a narrow escape. A mounted policeman stops Walter to check their papers (undoubtedly forged) while Walteress has gone to beg in a nearby village for some  sore. Walter convinces the policeman that nothing untoward is happening, but then the policeman hears dogs barking in the village and senses that something isn’t right. Walter has already left by this time, and Walteress, thinking quickly on her feet, realises what a pickle she’s in, avoids the policeman and meets up with Walter away from the village. The policeman realises that the two have  made a rabbit and pursues them. Fortunately, the Walter wagon races ahead and crosses the border to the next jurisdiction.</p><p>  他写了一个由沃尔特（Walter）和他的妻子领导的家庭，即沃尔特里斯（Walteress）的一个小小的家园。当沃尔特里斯（Walteress）去附近的一个村庄乞讨疼痛时，一个骑警去阻止沃尔特（Walter）检查他们的证件（无疑是伪造的）。瓦尔特（Walter）劝说警察什么都没发生，但随后警察听到狗在村子里咆哮，感觉有些不对劲。沃尔特（Walter）到此时已离开，沃尔特斯（Walteress）迅速思考，意识到自己在里面泡菜，躲开了警察，在村外与沃尔特（Walter）会面。警察意识到两人已经造了一只兔子并追赶他们。幸运的是，沃尔特旅行车向前行驶并越过边界到达下一个辖区。</p><p> Baumhauer knew all about escape. Once he’d finished writing his stories, the police relaxed their vigilance and he fled. The Baumhauer case is an unusual example of how this secret language survived via police archives. These records of Rotwelsch came from the intent to police its speakers, but they allowed me to reverse-engineer the lives of the speakers who expressed their view of the world through its distinct idiom.</p><p> 鲍姆豪厄对逃生一无所知。他写完故事后，警察放松了警惕，他逃跑了。鲍姆豪尔（Baumhauer）案是不寻常的例子，说明这种秘密语言是如何通过警察档案保存下来的。罗特维施（Rotwelsch）的这些记录都是出于监管演讲者的意图，但它们使我对演讲者的生活进行了逆向工程，他们通过独特的成语表达了对世界的看法。</p><p>  Early researchers of Rotwelsch, such as Avé-Lallemant, spoke of Rotwelsch as a ‘professional language’, the technical jargon of thieves comparable with that of doctors, lawyers, hunters (and professors). Today, linguists speak of it as a  sociolect, the speech of any distinct sub-group. A sociolect doesn’t quite rise to the level of a full language because it doesn’t have its own grammar; in the case of Rotwelsch, it borrowed its grammar from German. But precisely because Rotwelsch wasn’t a regular language and instead consisted of words useful only to a specific group – words for police, for getting into pickles, for getting arrested, for different kinds of prisons, and for making a quick escape – it now works so well as a record of a particular way of life.</p><p>  Rotwelsch的早期研究人员（例如Avé-Lallemant）将Rotwelsch称为“专业语言”，这是盗贼的技术行话，可与医生，律师，猎人（和教授）相提并论。今天，语言学家将其称为社交性语言，是任何不同子类别的语言。社交语言由于没有自己的语法而不能完全提高到完整的语言水平。在Rotwelsch的情况下，它是从德语借来的语法。但是正是因为Rotwelsch不是普通语言，而是由仅对特定人群有用的词组成-警务人员，进腌菜，被捕，各种监狱以及快速逃脱的单词-现在效果很好，可以记录特定的生活方式。</p><p> My uncle, a bohemian writer who had become obsessed with Rotwelsch, introduced me to it when I was a child. Over the course of many years, he had tracked down its remaining speakers and assembled a large archive on the language. When he died, I inherited his archive, a unique resource for studying the now-lost world of this itinerant underground.</p><p> 我的叔叔是一位波希米亚作家，他迷上了Rotwelsch，在我小时候就向我介绍了它。多年来，他一直在寻找剩余的发言人，并收集了大量关于该语言的档案。他去世后，我继承了他的档案，这是研究如今消失在地下的世界的独特资源。 </p><p> My study of Rotwelsch has also revealed secrets from my own family history. My grandfather, I learned, had been obsessed with Rotwelsch as well, although for different reasons. An early member of the Nazi Party, he had attacked Rotwelsch as an uncouth mixture of German and Yiddish that proved, to his mind, that all Jews were criminals. He wanted the language eliminated. Soon, he would almost get his wish, when Rotwelsch vagrants were among the first to be sent to concentration camps. After the war, he managed to avoid prosecution and bury his past. After learning of my grandfather’s role, I better understood why my uncle had devoted so much time to preserving and reviving Rotwelsch, and why he had taught the language to me: in a form of linguistic rebellion, perhaps even atonement, he decided to undo some of his father’s work.</p><p>我对Rotwelsch的研究也揭示了我自己家族史的秘密。我了解到，我的祖父也曾对Rotwelsch着迷，尽管出于不同的原因。他是纳粹党的早期成员，曾以德国人和意第绪人的混血袭击了Rotwelsch，在他看来，这证明了所有犹太人都是罪犯。他希望消除这种语言。很快，罗特维施（Rotwelsch）的流浪者是最早被送往集中营的人之一，他几乎如愿以偿。战后，他设法避免起诉并掩埋了自己的过去。了解了祖父的角色后，我更好地理解了为什么我叔叔花了这么多时间来保存和复兴罗特维施，以及为什么他向我教授了这种语言：以一种语言叛乱甚至是赎罪的形式，他决定撤消一些东西。父亲的工作</p><p> Throughout my research, I wondered what Rotwelsch sounded like. There would have been significant variations, depending on the different German dialects spoken in various regions of central Europe, from the Rhine to Prague, and from Hamburg to Zurich and Vienna, as well as dialects marked by Yiddish, Czech, Dutch and other regional languages. I was able to locate a documentary film about Gregor Gog, another Rotwelsch speaker I became fascinated with. Living in the first part of the 20th century, Gog tried to organise vagrants, which was why he became known as the King of the Tramps. For the same reason, he was one of the first vagrants to be sent to a Nazi concentration camp (fortunately he was able to make a rabbit and escape, ending up in the Soviet Union). The film documenting his reign is hidden deep in an archive in Berlin, housed in a former SS building, and difficult to access; disappointingly, it is silent.</p><p> 在整个研究过程中，我想知道Rotwelsch听起来是什么样的。根据中欧各个地区（从莱茵河到布拉格，从汉堡到苏黎世和维也纳）使用的不同的德国方言，以及以意第绪语，捷克语，荷兰语和其他区域语言标记的方言，可能会有很大的差异。 。我能够找到一部关于格里戈尔·戈格（Gregor Gog）的纪录片，格雷格·戈格是我迷恋的另一位Rotwelsch演讲者。高格生活在20世纪上半叶，试图组织流浪者，这就是为什么他成为流浪者之王的原因。出于同样的原因，他是被送往纳粹集中营的第一批流浪者之一（幸运的是，他能够制造出一只兔子并逃脱，最终进入了苏联）。记录他统治时期的电影被藏在柏林的一个档案馆中，该档案馆坐落在一座前党卫军大楼内，很难取用。令人失望的是，它是沉默的。</p><p> When I imagine how Rotwelsch must have sounded, I hear my uncle’s voice, softened by his Bavarian dialect, speaking these mysterious words that so captivated me as a child and that have never quite lost their hold over me.</p><p> 当我想象Rotwelsch一定会如何发声时，我听到叔叔的声音因他的巴伐利亚方言而变得柔和，说出这些神秘的字眼，使我小时候十分着迷，却从未失去对我的控制。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://psyche.co/ideas/how-a-secret-european-language-made-a-rabbit-and-survived">https://psyche.co/ideas/how-a-secret-european-language-made-a-rabbit-and-survived</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/欧洲/">#欧洲</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/european/">#european</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/rotwelsch/">#rotwelsch</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
