You can find the source code on  GitHub.\n As a candidate, I\u2019ve interviewed at a dozen big companies and startups. I\u2019ve got offers for machine learning roles at companies including Google, NVIDIA, Snap, Netflix, Primer AI, and Snorkel AI. I\u2019ve also been rejected at many other companies.\n As an interviewer, I\u2019ve been involved in designing and executing the hiring process at NVIDIA and Snorkel AI, having taken steps from cold emailing candidates whose work I love, screening resumes, doing exploratory and technical interviews, debating whether or not to hire a candidate, to trying to convince candidates to choose us over competitive offers.\n As a friend and teacher, I\u2019ve helped many friends and students prepare for their machine learning interviews at big companies and startups. I give them mock interviews and take notes of the process they went through as well as the questions they were asked.\n I\u2019ve also consulted several startups on their machine learning hiring pipelines. Hiring for machine learning roles turned out to be pretty difficult when you don\u2019t already have a strong in-house machine learning team and process to help you evaluate candidates. As the use of machine learning in the industry is still pretty new, a lot of companies are still making it up as they go along, which doesn\u2019t make it easier for candidates.\n This book is the result of the collective wisdom of many people who have sat on both sides of the table and who have spent a lot of time thinking about the hiring process. It was written with candidates in mind, but hiring managers who saw the early drafts told me that they found it helpful to learn how other companies are hiring, and to rethink their own process.\n The book consists of two parts. The first part provides an overview of the machine learning interview process, what types of machine learning roles are available, what skills each role requires, what kinds of questions are often asked, and how to prepare for them. This part also explains the interviewers\u2019 mindset and what kind of signals they look for.\n The second part consists of over 200 knowledge questions, each noted with its level of difficulty -- interviews for more senior roles should expect harder questions -- that cover important concepts and common misconceptions in machine learning.\n After you&#39;ve finished this book, you might want to checkout  the 30 open-ended questions to test your ability to put together what you know to solve practical challenges. These questions test your problem-solving skills as well as the extent of your experiences in implementing and deploying machine learning models. Some companies call them  machine learning systems design questions. Almost all companies I\u2019ve talked to ask at least a question of this type in their interview process, and they are the questions that candidates often find to be the hardest.\n \u201cMachine learning systems design\u201d is an intricate topic that merits its own book. To learn more about it, check out my course   CS 329S: Machine learning systems design at Stanford.\n This book is not a replacement to machine learning textbooks nor a shortcut to game the interviews. It\u2019s a tool to consolidate your existing theoretical and practical knowledge in machine learning. The questions in this book can also help identify your blind/weak spots. Each topic is accompanied by resources that should help you strengthen your understanding of that topic.\n  This book was created by  Chip Huyen with the help of wonderful friends.

itself to recognize thousands of products, models, parts, and components by ingesting only a handful of data points. TechSee claims that by leveraging a combination of  AI and synthetic data, Cortex can train itself in a matter of hours, providing end users with step-by-step visual guidance via an  augmented reality (AR) overlay.\n The\u00a0AR market is estimated to grow from $10.7 billion in 2019 to $72.7 billion by 2024, according to a recent Markets and Markets\u00a0 report. At least a portion of that growth has been driven by field service applications; technicians are faced with the challenging task of working on equipment with varying technical specifications, often in confined or hard-to-reach spaces. With AR apps, they could have all of the information they need displayed in front of them while keeping their hands free to work.\n  TechSee was founded in 2014 by Eitan Cohen, Amir Yoffe, and Gabby Sarusi. Cohen conceptualized the idea after struggling to walk his parents through an issue they were having with their cable service. The company\u2019s cross-platform apps employ computer vision to recognize products and issues and streamline warranty registration. Customer agents can see what customers see through their smartphone cameras and visually guide them to resolutions, using either live video or photos.\n Cortex builds on TechSee\u2019s existing technologies to enable enterprises to custom-build their own visual self-service flows, without coding. With Cortex, companies can design journeys for product unboxing, billing, contracting, troubleshooting, warranty claims, product registration, technical repair, and more.\n \u201cThe future is here, and it\u2019s time to say goodbye to user manuals and embrace AR assistants,\u201d Cohen said in a press release. \u201cVirtual assistants that can see, hear, read, and interact are what\u2019s going to transform the way that consumers and employees receive assistance, while saving brands millions and generating new revenue.\u201d\n  Cortex can walk users through the unboxing of various consumer electronics, from security cameras to thermostats, and capture information for upselling while explaining invoices by reading water, gas, and electrical meters. Insurance policyholders can use Cortex to document damage to insured property or identify items they want to insure for virtual underwriting. Moreover, Cortex can certify that an on-site field technician has made a successful repair by examining work through the technician\u2019s smartphone or tablet camera or AR glasses.\n Behind the scenes, TechSee employs a combination of few-shot learning, transfer learning, and fine tuning for image segmentation and classification.  Few-shot learning refers to the practice of feeding an AI model with a very small amount of training data, while  transfer learning is a technique where a model trained on one task is repurposed on a second task.\n One of the ways that Cortex learns to recognize products is by ingesting a company\u2019s existing contact center knowledge base. For every device, each article describing visual symptoms and issues, both from customers and field technicians, is extracted and normalized. Then, a computer vision model is trained on synthetic visual data gathered in the lab as well as other visual resources and images supplied by customers, enabling Cortex to analyze, time, and measure the success of each step of every resolution, shortening and optimizing them over time.\n To use Cortex, a user taps on a link sent in a text message from a self-service channel and connects via a web browser. They\u2019re guided visually and with voice instructions on how to capture images. After they receive a confirmation message with a reference code, a customer service agent joins, views the images during a live video session, and provides step-by-step on-screen AR guidance.\n According to Cohen, companies including Vodafone, Telus, Orange, and Hippo have already tapped Cortex to create new customer experiences. Moreover, tens of thousands of field service technicians in the U.S. are using the platform to install fiber optic boxes.\n \u201cOne of the very few silver linings to come out of this pandemic is that it\u2019s accelerated adoption for our technology \u2014 in the field, at support centers, and for individual consumers,\u201d Cohen told VentureBeat in a previous interview. \u201cEverything is now contactless. When technicians simply aren\u2019t allowed to enter a customer\u2019s home to repair, say, a wireless router, or when a field technician cannot be dispatched to repair an HVAC system, both businesses and customers have to adapt.\u201d\n VentureBeat&#39;s mission is to be a digital town square for technical decision-makers to gain knowledge about transformative technology and transact.Our site delivers essential information on data technologies and strategies to guide you as you lead your organizations.

labour shortages are still worsening. In America the number of unfilled vacancies, at 9.3m, has never been so high. Job postings in Canada are 20% above pre-pandemic levels. Even in Europe, slower out of the post-lockdown gates, a growing number of employers complain of how hard it is to find staff. Debates over labour shortages have focused on welfare policy and economic disruption. But the phenomenon has a deeper lesson. It tells us something about the myths of automation.\n  Economists have confidently asserted that a wave of job-killing robots was sweeping the labour market. The   says the pandemic is \u201chastening a shift in employment away from sectors more vulnerable to automation\u201d. In a recent co-written article Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel prizewinner, says the extra costs of covid-19 are \u201caccelerating the development and adoption of new technologies to automate human work.\u201d In congressional testimony last year Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggested that more firms were \u201csubstituting machines for workers\u201d. But can pandemic-induced automation really be creating an army of surplus workers if employers are complaining of a deficit?\n  The economists had good reason to believe that job-killing automation would surge. Recessions often lead firms to adopt more robots, in part because labour gets more expensive as revenues but not wages decline. In a pandemic bosses have an extra incentive to automate jobs, as research by the   has shown. Robots do not need to socially distance. Nor do they get sick. Thanks largely to government stimulus programmes, firms have also accumulated spare cash, which they may now be able to deploy on robotics or on artificial-intelligence software.\n Those who believe that automation is speeding up can point to many examples. In Ohio Lee\u2019s Famous Recipe Chicken, a restaurant chain, has installed automated voice systems to take drive-through orders. Pittsburgh\u2019s international airport recently became America\u2019s first to use ultraviolet robots for cleaning. British farmers boast of using ever more machines to pick strawberries and kill weeds. The number of news stories mentioning both \u201cpandemic\u201d and \u201cautomation\u201d is growing at an annual rate of 25%.\n The automation debate is heavy on speculation and anecdote. It is light on evidence. The citation from one prominent wonk to justify the claim that automation was \u201calready\u201d happening included a  New York Times article and a theoretical microeconomics paper. According to some research, last year automatable jobs vanished in large numbers; but it is hard to disentangle the effect of technological change from lockdowns. It is true that America\u2019s   is nearly at its pre-pandemic level even as the level of employment is 7m lower. This, some say, shows that the economy can get by with many fewer people. But it could just mean that productivity per worker has risen, perhaps because of poorly understood things like remote working. Many of those on the sidelines will get jobs as fear of the virus fades and they find something which suits them, in turn raising output above pre-pandemic levels.\n  It is not only labour shortages which undermine the story of a growing wave of job-killing robots. In America the wages of the worst-paid workers, who are thought to be especially vulnerable to automation, are rising more quickly than the average, in contrast to the aftermath of the financial crisis. Borrowing a methodology from the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis,  The Economist has divided America\u2019s labour market into \u201croutine\u201d and \u201cnon-routine\u201d roles. Routine jobs involve patterns which are easier for robots to learn: say, data entry or checking out goods in a supermarket. For four decades routine jobs have slowly declined as a share of the total, as robots have improved (see chart).\n  So far, however, the covid-induced downturn is bucking the trend. Had the pre-pandemic rate continued, we estimate that in May 2021 routine jobs would have accounted for 40.9% of overall employment. In fact they now account for 41.4%, meaning that America now has in the order of 1m \u201cextra\u201d routine jobs than expected. Perhaps the uncertainty over variants is deferring some investment in robotics. The mere act of installing new machinery is also more difficult in a world of travel bans and quarantine. American imports of industrial robots fell by 3% in 2020.\n Australia may be a better place to look for signs of a job-killing wave. After some strict lockdowns the country has been under fairly loose domestic restrictions for over a year, giving a glimpse of what may lie in store elsewhere. Adapting the results of a government study in 2015, we gave 335 occupations (from \u201chotel and motel managers\u201d to \u201ccomplementary health therapists\u201d) a score from zero to 100, reflecting how automatable they seem.\n Automatable jobs were in relative decline before the pandemic, falling to 57% of the workforce by 2019. The trend has continued, with evidence of a covid-19 acceleration: 55% of Australians are now employed in vulnerable occupations. (We found similar trends in New Zealand.) Yet Australia\u2019s unemployment rate is nearly as low as before the pandemic. Howls from employers about labour shortages are even louder than in America. Automation is not, it seems, putting people on the economic scrapheap.\n The pessimists could eventually be proved right. But even if they are not, predictions of a world without work will continue. This is because the enduring fear of the march of the machines is not really the result of a dispassionate analysis of the evidence. It could hardly be so, when centuries of technological improvement have never led to widespread structural unemployment. Countries with more robots tend to have less joblessness, not more.\n  Worries about technological unemployment are instead the expression of something else. They reflect a deep-seated fascination with and fear of technology. And they reflect many economists\u2019 concern to get policymakers to pay more attention to the job prospects of people with the least marketable skills, who are always most vulnerable to economic shifts and shocks. These are perfectly understandable motivations. But next time you hear a warning about job-killing robots, think twice.  \u25a0\n  All our stories relating to the pandemic and the vaccines can be found on our  coronavirus hub.

The company says the training \u2014 including \u201csafe marksmanship\u201d and \u201ccountering an attack\u201d \u2014 was defensive in nature and devised to better protect Saudi leaders. One person familiar with the training said it also included work in surveillance and close-quarters battle.\n There is no evidence that the American officials who approved the training or Tier 1 Group executives knew that the Saudis were involved in the crackdown inside Saudi Arabia. But the fact that the government approved high-level military training for operatives who went on to carry out the grisly killing of a journalist shows how intensely intertwined the United States has become with an autocratic nation even as its agents committed horrific human rights abuses.\n It also underscores the perils of military partnerships with repressive governments and demonstrates how little oversight exists for those forces after they return home.\n Such issues are likely to continue as American private military contractors increasingly look to foreign clients to shore up their business as the United States scales back overseas deployments after two decades of war.\n The State Department initially granted a license for the paramilitary training of the Saudi Royal Guard to Tier 1 Group starting in 2014, during the Obama administration. The training continued during at least the first year of former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s term.\n Louis Bremer, a senior executive of Cerberus, Tier 1 Group\u2019s parent company, confirmed his company\u2019s role in the training last year in written answers to questions from lawmakers as part of his nomination for a top Pentagon job during the Trump administration.\n The administration does not appear to have sent the document to Congress before withdrawing Mr. Bremer\u2019s nomination; lawmakers never received answers to their questions.\n In the document, which Mr. Bremer provided to The New York Times, he said that four members of the Khashoggi kill team had received Tier 1 Group training in 2017, and two of them had participated in a previous iteration of the training, which went from October 2014 until January 2015.\n \u201cThe training provided was unrelated to their subsequent heinous acts,\u201d Mr. Bremer said in his responses.\n He said that a March 2019 review by Tier 1 Group \u201cuncovered no wrongdoing by the company and confirmed that the established curriculum training was unrelated to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.\u201d\n  Mr. Bremer said that the State Department, \u201cin collaboration with other U.S. departments and agencies,\u201d is responsible for vetting the foreign forces trained on U.S. soil. \u201cAll foreign personnel trained by T1G are cleared by the U.S. government for entry into the United States before commencement of training.\u201d\n In a statement, Mr. Bremer said that the training was \u201cprotective in nature\u201d and that the company conducted no further training of Saudis after December 2017.\n \u201cT1G management, the board and I stand firmly with the U.S. government, the American people and the international community in condemning the horrific murder of Jamal Khashoggi,\u201d he said.\n A 2019 column by David Ignatius of The Washington Post first reported that members of the Khashoggi kill team had received training in the United States. He wrote that the C.I.A. had \u201ccautioned other government agencies\u201d that some special-operations training may have been conducted by Tier 1 Group under a State Department license.\n The issue was central to Mr. Bremer\u2019s contentious confirmation hearing and the written questions from senators, asking him what role, if any, Tier 1 Group had in training Saudis who had participated in the Khashoggi operation.\n A State Department spokesman declined to confirm whether it awarded licenses to Tier 1 Group for the Saudi training.\n \u201cThis administration insists on responsible use of U.S. origin defense equipment and training by our allies and partners, and considers appropriate responses if violations occur,\u201d said the spokesman, Ned Price. \u201cSaudi Arabia faces significant threats to its territory, and we are committed to working together to help Riyadh strengthen its defenses.\u201d\n  Mr. Trump weighed  installing the head of Cerberus, Stephen A. Feinberg, in a top intelligence post last year, but the appointment was never made. While the Trump administration had appointed Mr. Feinberg to lead the President\u2019s Intelligence Advisory Board in 2018, questions emerged about potential conflicts of interest. Cerberus  formerly owned the military contractor DynCorp, which among other things provides intelligence advice to the United States and other clients.\n It is unclear which members of the Khashoggi kill team participated in the Tier 1 Group training. Seven members of the team belonged to an elite unit charged with protecting Prince Mohammed, according to an American  intelligence report about the assassination declassified in February.\n The role of operatives from the so-called Rapid Intervention Force in the Khashoggi killing helped bolster the American intelligence case that Prince Mohammed approved the operation.\n \u201cMembers of the R.I.F. would not have participated\u201d in the killing without his consent, according to the report. The group \u201cexists to defend the crown prince\u201d and \u201canswers only to him,\u201d the document said.\n Members of the team that killed Mr. Khashoggi were involved in at least a dozen operations starting in 2017, according to officials who have read classified intelligence reports about the campaign.\n Mr. Khashoggi, a columnist for The Post, was killed inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in October 2018, his body dismembered using a bone saw. The assassination brought widespread condemnation on Prince Mohammed, who has publicly denied any knowledge of the operation.\n  Eight defendants  were sentenced to up to two decades in prison last year, but human rights advocates criticized the punishments as aimed at lower-level agents while sparing their leaders.\n The C.I.A. concluded that the prince directed the operation, but Mr. Trump said that the evidence was inconclusive and that America\u2019s  diplomatic and economic relationship with the kingdom took priority. After President Biden took office and debated the issue with his advisers before the release of the declassified intelligence report, his administration announced sanctions on Saudis involved in the killing, including members of the elite unit who protect Prince Mohammed, but chose not to directly punish the crown prince.\n The earlier iteration of the training, which took place during the Obama administration, occurred before Prince Mohammed consolidated power in the kingdom. His predecessor as crown prince, Mohammed bin Nayef, was a close ally of the United States and in particular John O. Brennan, who served as C.I.A. director under President Barack Obama.\n Prince bin Nayef was the Saudi counterterrorism chief and collaborated closely with Obama administration officials in working to dismantle Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terrorist group\u2019s affiliate based in Yemen.\n In 2017, Prince bin Salman pushed Prince bin Nayef from power and executed a broader campaign to wrest power from his rivals \u2014 including a notorious episode of imprisoning Saudi royals and businessmen at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh.\n The Trump administration considered him a valuable partner in the Middle East \u2014 especially for the administration\u2019s strategy to isolate Iran \u2014 and Prince bin Salman developed a close relationship with Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law who served as a senior adviser to Mr. Trump.\n  Prince bin Salman, the son of King Salman, is the next in line to the Saudi throne. Prince bin Nayef remains under house arrest in the kingdom.\n The  Tier 1 Group website lists numerous American special operations and intelligence units as clients, along with \u201cspecialty units that do not require recognition.\u201d It said it also trains \u201cOGA special operator teams\u201d \u2014 one pseudonym for C.I.A. paramilitary units \u2014 as well as \u201cinternational allied forces.\u201d\n Under federal rules that restrict foreign sales of American arms and military expertise, Tier 1 Group was required to apply for licenses to train the foreign operatives. Those license applications were examined by State Department officials \u2014 who were processing tens of thousands of licenses per year \u2014 and approved.\n The approval would have allowed members of the Saudi Royal Guard to enter the United States on visas processed by the American Embassy in Riyadh. The path is similar to the one followed by Second Lt. Mohammed Alshamrani, a Royal Saudi Air Force officer who  opened fire in 2019 at a naval air station in Pensacola, Fla., where he was receiving military flight training. The attack killed three people and wounded eight.\n Tier 1 Group was founded to train U.S. military personnel, taking advantage of an expanded Pentagon budget for military personnel training in basic counterinsurgency skills, according to former American officials familiar with its operations.\n One of the company\u2019s founders, Steve Reichert, a former Marine, was working as an instructor for the security contractor then known as Blackwater when he met Mr. Feinberg. With Mr. Feinberg\u2019s backing, Mr. Reichert set up Tier 1 Group, according to Mr. Reichert\u2019s  2020 account of the company\u2019s founding and former intelligence officials familiar with the efforts.\n But as U.S. military training budgets began to shrink, the company, like other private security firms, began searching for new clients. By 2014, it was beginning to train foreign military units, including Saudis.\n Decisions about granting licenses to American firms to train foreign nationals are usually made after getting input from numerous government agencies, said R. Clarke Cooper, the assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs during the Trump administration. The Pentagon and intelligence agencies often play a role, he said.\n \u201cThese things don\u2019t just come out of the ether,\u201d he said.\n Mr. Cooper said he could not recall any discussion about the Tier 1 Group training of Saudis, even after Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing. He said there were intense deliberations inside the Trump administration about how to respond to the killing after the government concluded that Prince Mohammed most likely approved it.\n In the end, he said, administration officials did not want to squander America\u2019s relationship with the kingdom \u2014 and the strategy of isolating Iran \u2014 by taking a heavy-handed approach after Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n \u201cNo government is going to flush a significant bilateral relationship over this murder, no matter how horrific it was,\u201d he said.", "posttime": "2021-06-23

", "note_en": "Skip to main content                                                                                                                When Paul McBeth first started playing in professional disc golf tournaments, he\u2019d crisscross California in his father\u2019s 1978 Dodge Ramcharger. His dad had mostly used it to rock-crawl in the desert outskirts of Los Angeles. The top of the SUV was sawed off and the side windows were smashed out. The doors were so dented they looked like topographic maps. The windshield was scarred, and the gas pedal was missing. When storm clouds gathered, Paul kicked a metal bar to the floor as he tried to outrun the rain.\n His next few cars weren\u2019t much nicer. When he was 19, he found out a friend was planning to dump an Infiniti I30 in the scrapyard and offered to pay him $500 for it. McBeth drove it from L.A. to Kansas City for the  2009 Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA) world championships and  almost all the way back. It blew a gasket 30 minutes from his house. Then there was his Ford Thunderbird that overheated every half-hour on the highway, and his camper van that he thought would save him money on hotels but ended up costing him at the gas pump.\n Finally, in 2011, after winning $4,000 for taking first place at the Memorial Championship in Scottsdale, Arizona, McBeth had saved enough money to buy a new car. He wanted a Jeep Patriot. The problem was the paperwork. \u201cUnder occupation, I put \u2018professional athlete,\u2019\u201d McBeth says. \u201cI guess they didn\u2019t believe me because they wouldn\u2019t let me finance it. I ended up having to buy the car with cash.\u201d\n In the decade since, McBeth\u2019s disc golf career has soared. He\u2019s won the PDGA world championship five times and the United States Disc Golf championship twice. In 2010, the PDGA championship\u2019s total purse was  $33,782; at this week\u2019s event, the men\u2019s winnings are expected to be upward of  $150,000. McBeth has earned more than  half a million dollars from his performances. He is, undoubtedly, the most accomplished disc golfer in the world.\n But except to a subset of hardcore frisbee fans, his more impressive accomplishments have come away from the course. In February, disc golf manufacturer Discraft announced it had extended McBeth\u2019s endorsement deal to a  guaranteed  $10 million over 10 years. McBeth also has sponsors for other disc golf gear, such as grip equipment and bags, and owns part of a company called Foundation Disc Golf that produces both products and content. He has deals outside of disc golf equipment too, with the likes of Adidas and Celsius energy drink. According to 2019 data from the  athlete marketing platform Opendorse, only about 70 athletes in the world make at least a million dollars a year in endorsement deals. McBeth\u2019s endorsement income from Discraft alone puts him on par with Bears linebacker Khalil Mack, Jazz guard Mike Conley Jr., and Astros pitcher Justin Verlander.\n \u201cUnder occupation, I put \u2018professional athlete.\u2019 I guess they didn\u2019t believe me because they wouldn\u2019t let me finance it. I ended up having to buy the car with cash.\u201d \u2014Paul McBeth\n McBeth has carved out a lucrative career in a niche sport, in part as an athlete and in part as an influencer. He isn\u2019t alone in using this blueprint. Competitors in sports ranging from bowling to lacrosse have been able to amass riches by building their brands\u2014and growing the games they love along the way.\n \u201cI think about it as a three-step funnel,\u201d says Li Jin, the founder of the digital marketing platform Atelier Ventures who coined the term \u201cPassion Economy\u201d to describe how influencers monetize social media. The first step is to attract a big audience on a known platform, like Instagram or Twitter. The second is to bring them to a platform the influencer owns, such as a newsletter or podcast. The final step is to turn people into paying customers. \u201cThat,\u201d she says, \u201cis how influencers turn social capital into financial capital.\u201d\n McBeth agreed to that $10 million deal in July 2020 after hosting a paintball party for his 30th birthday. A couple of months later, he signed the paperwork at Discraft\u2019s headquarters in Michigan. In November, he shared a  series of stories with his 150,000-plus Instagram followers. The first showed a trailer from a car dealership in Michigan. The second and third showed glamorous shots of his latest car purchase: a McLaren 570S Spider. The luxury convertible\u2014which starts at more than $200,000\u2014has switchblade doors and a retractable roof.\n   By now you may have started browsing for disc golf gear in another tab. But before you complete your order, you first need to figure out how to get anyone\u2019s attention. Not long ago, niche sports cracked the national consciousness only as punch lines. In a now-iconic  Seinfeld episode, George Costanza gets a severance package from the Yankees\u2014enough to sustain him for an entire summer\u2014and tells Jerry he\u2019s going to learn to play frolf.\n    In the 2004 comedy  Dodgeball, Vince Vaughn\u2019s group of misfits face off against Ben Stiller\u2019s crew of hulking weightlifters on a fictional channel called ESPN 8: The Ocho. The parody network became such a cultural phenomenon that in 2017 ESPN launched an annual \u201c Ocho TV\u201d day, featuring events like the National Stone Skipping Competition and World Sign Spinning Championship. (How sign spinning became an international competition before stone skipping is a mystery best explored in a separate story.) But those so-called joke sports have had the last laugh. From 2017 to 2019, ESPN\u2019s the Ocho ratings  climbed year over year. Last May, a deadlift world record attempt drew more than  300,000 viewers\u2014the network\u2019s most-watched program of the day.\n For many niche sports, television is still seen as the ultimate status symbol. Some leagues have gone so far as to buy air time for their biggest events. Last year, Dynamic Discs paid the CBS Sports Network \u201c in excess of six figures\u201d to broadcast their disc golf tournament. This stands in contrast to networks\u2019 relationships with the more prominent sports leagues. In March, the NFL  secured $113 billion from its television partners for the rights to air football games over the next 11 years.\n But television isn\u2019t the only way to command mass attention. For smaller sports and their stars, social media provides access to massive audiences without traditional gatekeepers. \u201cTo millions of kids, TikTok and YouTube are mainstream entertainment. They don\u2019t watch TV,\u201d says Taylor Lorenz, who covers social media, Gen Z, and influencers for  The New York Times. \u201cSometimes you need to get onto TV to get credibility with boomer CEOs. But for individuals, you can often monetize better on your social media.\u201d\n  The surest path to profitability is to go viral. And the kings of the viral clip are the dudes from Dude Perfect. What began as a series of stunts by college roommates at Texas A&amp;M has turned into the most popular sports channel on YouTube. Dude Perfect has nearly twice as many subscribers (56 million) as four major U.S. sports leagues\u2014the NBA (16.7 million), NFL (7.8 million), MLB (3.0 million), and NHL (1.6 million)\u2014combined. Its  water bottle flips and  ping-pong tricks have reshaped what constitutes athletic accomplishment online. And its influence echoes across the niche sports landscape. (The dudes declined to be interviewed for this story.)\n McBeth is friends and business partners with Brodie Smith, a former ultimate player who became internet famous for his frisbee trick shots and has collaborated on three videos with Dude Perfect. Smith, who boasts more than 2 million YouTube subscribers and almost a million Instagram and Twitter followers, instantly became the world\u2019s most famous disc golf player when he turned pro in late 2019. Smith has documented his journey into the sport, and has learned the finer points of the game from McBeth. In exchange, Smith has schooled McBeth on the finer points of internet fame. \u201cBrodie has made everyone in disc golf up their YouTube game,\u201d McBeth says. \u201cHe\u2019s inspired me a lot. We used to try to find the time to post videos when we could. Now we make the time. It\u2019s become a priority.\u201d\n  Jason Belmonte, the most accomplished professional bowler in the world, has collaborated on two videos with Dude Perfect. The first\u2014which shows him whizzing bowling balls past the dudes\u2019 heads and breaking flying plates with bowling pins\u2014has accumulated almost 100 million views. According to  Aux Mode, a digital service that projects the value of YouTube videos, 100 million views translates to about $400,000 of revenue. The popularity of a channel and its engagement rate can increase the value of those videos even further.\n  \u201cSome people in my fan base can recite every single stunt I performed in those videos but don\u2019t know how many titles I\u2019ve won,\u201d says Belmonte, who\u2019s captured 25 Professional Bowlers Association titles, including a record 13 major championships. \u201cEntertainment is king right now. Whether you\u2019re bowling around a dude\u2019s head or doing the world\u2019s longest strike, entertainment is what sticks in people\u2019s minds.\u201d\n Until television rights deals increase enough to start funding substantial salaries in niche sports, social media is the best way for these athletes to earn a living. Life-changing money  is out there, but they do have to earn it.\n  When Jennifer Delaney was a little girl, her father fastened a string to two ends of a stick to create a makeshift bow and instill in her a love of archery. As an MBA candidate at SMU, she rediscovered this passion as a way to relieve her stress from school and networking events. Her mother thought she should have taken up a \u201cnormal\u201d sport, like golf. In the beginning, Delaney wondered whether she was right. \u201cFor the first few months, I had bruises and blood blisters on my hands and fingers,\u201d Delaney says. \u201cI got mosquito bites from being outside so much. I got torn up.\u201d\n  To break up the monotony of practice, she started imagining more intricate targets. She launched a TikTok account called Freedom and Feathers, and made a video in which she  shot a swinging tic tac into a tic-tac-toe board. She has used arrows to  light a match and  blow out a candle. In her most popular video, which has more than 7 million views, she tosses a tennis ball in the air and pierces it as it descends. Delaney does this on top of her day job as a consultant, and estimates she spends between 30 minutes and a full weekend purchasing supplies and constructing targets. Filming the videos can take anywhere from a few minutes\u2014she shot through a Life Saver on her third try\u2014to a few days. And the process doesn\u2019t end there.\n Every time she posts a video to her nearly 1 million TikTok followers, Delaney sets a goal to respond to at least 50 comments. Even though she keeps a note on her phone with standard responses to FAQs, she can\u2019t ever clear her backlog of DMs. Still, she spends hours a day responding, because she sees how it inspires girls to get into the sport, and she wants to create a sense of community.\n \u201cHow do small sports become big ones? I got interested in that question because I really love disc golf,\u201d says Joshua Woods, a sociology professor at West Virginia who studies alternative sports and serves as the editor of the disc golf website  Parked. \u201cAnd that\u2019s part of the answer to the question: a critical mass of people become emotionally connected to a sport. People like Paul McBeth are getting paid because they can cut through the noise, and there\u2019s so much noise in the age of the internet. Passionate fans can feel like they\u2019re part of an intimate community.\u201d\n Even the most active NBA fans don\u2019t expect stars to respond to social media messages. (Unless they have talked shit about Kevin Durant, in which case they\u2019ll absolutely hear back. Hi, KD.) But the fans of niche sports sometimes feel a sense of ownership over those sports, and a sense of entitlement when interacting with their stars. Spending so much time sorting through comments can make it hard for those athletes to filter out the trolls. Delaney says that she gets daily sexist messages from men who claim what she does is easy. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018Big deal, someone has already done that particular shot.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Basketball players have made shots from every spot on the floor. That doesn\u2019t make a half-court shot any less impressive.\u2019\u201d\n \u201cSome people in my fan base can recite every single stunt I performed in those videos but don\u2019t know how many titles I\u2019ve won. Entertainment is king right now.\u201d \u2014Jason Belmonte\n When Belmonte first started bowling as a child, he couldn\u2019t lift the ball, so he pioneered the practice of bowling with both hands. While most players bowl using a single arm, Belmonte  uses both to improve his power and control. That style makes him stand out the way Rick Barry once did with his underhanded free throw shooting. When Belmonte began competing professionally, he was inundated with comments about his form. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how you can scroll right past a thousand positive comments and focus on the one negative comment you see,\u201d he says. \u201cIt took me a long time to learn how to deal with that.\u201d\n He later learned that some of those online trolls were actually his competitors in the lanes. He says that several times he\u2019s walked into the locker room\u2014yes, there are locker rooms for bowlers\u2014and overheard other bowlers whispering about how they\u2019d created burner accounts to harass him. \u201cI used to tell them \u2018Don\u2019t hide behind a username. Say it to my face.\u2019  Then they\u2019d deny it,\u201d Belmonte says. \u201cNow my reply is \u2018I have more of everything than you do. There\u2019s nothing you have that I would want.\u2019\u201d\n Belmonte also credits his unusual style for his success on social media. He\u2019s by far the most popular bowler across all of the major platforms, with 130,000 Instagram followers, 44,000 Twitter followers, and 66,000 YouTube subscribers. His bios online tout his unusual style, and his email signature reads, \u201cThis email was typed using #2HANDS.\u201d He has double-handedly changed the game of bowling for professionals and amateurs alike, many of whom trace their ability to enjoy the sport to his trailblazing style. That sense of community can be lucrative for Belmonte, who regularly releases  limited-edition merchandise for $25 to $60 on Instagram. He says those sales, which number in the thousands every year, provide \u201cfantastic supplementary income.\u201d\n \u201cIn niche sports, social media is 10 times\u2014maybe 100 times\u2014more important to an athlete than it is in mainstream sports,\u201d Belmonte says. \u201cMainstream sports stars get constant TV coverage. They\u2019re in people\u2019s faces all the time. If you\u2019re in a niche sport, you have to tell people what you have coming up and what you\u2019ve achieved. You want people to feel like they\u2019re a part of this journey.\u201d\n  As she was languishing last summer before her freshman year at Aquinas College in Michigan, volleyball player Chloe Mitchell decided\u2014like so many of us during the pandemic\u2014that she had seen just about enough of her family. Behind her house was a storage space with dusty walls and rusty bicycles, so she asked her parents for permission to convert it into a \u201cshe shed.\u201d She\u2019d recently gotten into TikTok, and posted a video documenting the change to her account. Within four days, it had accumulated a million views. By the time the shed was transformed, so too was her life. She had more than a million followers, and no idea what to do next.\n @chloevmitchell  It\u2019s DONEEEE! Thank you for watching the process and having fun with me. Check out the link in my bio if you want to see a longer she shed tour :))\n  \u266c Funky Town - The Dance Queen Group\n She didn\u2019t want to be a one-clip wonder, so she took a couple weeks off before coming back with a new project: remodeling the bathroom that she shared with her brother. \u201cI had this massive decrease in followers after the first project was finished,\u201d she says. \u201cBeing a TikTok star had  just happened, and it wasn\u2019t part of my identity. When my followers started going back up after my second project, I knew I could sustain something.\u201d\n  Mitchell\u2019s fame had nothing to do with volleyball. Nonetheless, NCAA name, image, and likeness (NIL) rules would have prevented her from collecting any profits from her social media success. During recruiting, Mitchell nearly committed to an NCAA Division II school, which would\u2019ve cost her dearly. Instead, she chose to compete at the NAIA level, which  granted athletes NIL rights in October 2020. Mitchell is now  believed to be the first college athlete to make money from endorsements. (Well,   legal money anyway.) Since then, she has earned enough to buy a laptop and a car, as well as pay off her student debt. She\u2019s saving up for her next project: flipping a house.\n As soon as this summer, NCAA athletes in states such as Florida and Mississippi will gain NIL rights. Sensing that seismic shift in the economics of college sports, Mitchell and her father, Keith, founded a company called PlayBooked. PlayBooked already has four full-time employees and has connected more than 130 NAIA athletes to paid social media sponsorship opportunities. Keith is so bullish on its prospects he turned down venture capital funding and predicts that there will be a PlayBooked Bowl by 2025.\n For athletes in niche sports, their college tenures often represent the peak of their popularity. Being able to make endorsement money, then, would be an absolute game-changer. \u201cThe riches,\u201d Keith says, \u201care in the niches.\u201d\n Myles Jones first started getting interested in Instagram while he was playing lacrosse at Duke. Every time his team played on ESPNU, he\u2019d return to his phone to discover a few hundred additional followers. He was majoring in marketing at the time, and wanted to test his ability to build his own brand. He was so successful that on the day after his 2016 graduation, STX Lacrosse representatives flew out to ink him to an endorsement deal. Within a few months, he\u2019d also signed with Adidas and made a few thousand dollars for promoting a protein powder on Instagram.\n \u201cIn niche sports, social media is 10 times\u2014maybe 100 times\u2014more important to an athlete than it is in mainstream sports. You want people to feel like they\u2019re a part of this journey.\u201d \u2014Jason Belmonte\n In November, Jones signed a major endorsement deal with Degree. He declined to reveal the exact dollar figure involved, but said he thought his agent had typed an extra zero at the end of the number when he read the text confirming the details. Yet Jones says the meaning of the deal was as significant as the money. \u201cI was stepping into the non-endemic space. A lot of what guys are selling in lacrosse is equipment\u2014sticks and goals. I felt like I was bridging the gap between a small sport and the mainstream culture. You can\u2019t buy lacrosse gear at the supermarket, but everybody needs deodorant.\u201d\n Even in mainstream sports, most athletes rely on apparel companies like Nike or Adidas as their primary sponsors. And while deals like LeBron James\u2019s lifetime contract with Nike make national headlines, most athletes have what are known as merchandise deals. They don\u2019t get money, but they get as many products as they want. Only the big names receive cash deals, and even then the payout\u2014in the low six figures, if they\u2019re lucky\u2014is generally pennies compared to their contracts. Only the megastars make millions from endorsements.\n Yet while mainstream athletes often live off their sport salaries alone, niche sport athletes typically have to rely on multiple income streams.

But  faced with five antitrust bills that could unwind  what the House Judiciary Committee described as Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook\u2019s \u201cmonopoly power,\u201d Big Tech is bringing out the big lobbying guns.\n Apple CEO Tim Cook himself called Speaker Nancy Pelosi to \u201cdeliver a warning\u201d that that the \u201crushed\u201d antitrust bills could disrupt the iPhone,  according to  The New York Times , and that\u2019s not all:\n \u201cExecutives, lobbyists, and more than a dozen think tanks and advocacy groups paid by tech companies have swarmed Capitol offices, called and emailed lawmakers and their staff members, and written letters arguing there will be dire consequences for the industry and the country if the ideas become law,\u201d the NYT wrote.\n There\u2019s a growing sense that the current administration has a genuine interest in combating tech monopolies \u2014 a point perhaps made most clearly when Biden chose prominent antitrust scholar and Amazon critic Lina Khan to lead the Federal Trade Commission.  She was sworn in last week.\n  It\u2019s not unusual for tech companies to dive deeper into lobbying these days, as you\u2019d expect now that they\u2019re the most valuable companies in the world, and we\u2019ve seen their outsize influence overwhelm voters and legislators at the local level before. Uber and Lyft won big  after backing the most expensive measure in California history, using their own apps  as an unfair advantage, and Arizona\u2019s controversial app store bill  mysteriously disappeared after tech companies stepped in. An Apple lobbyist managed to  scare California legislators away from a right-to-repair bill in 2019, too.\n Pelosi apparently wasn\u2019t having it, though, at least not on the call.

", "note_en": "Programming     My previous article, \u201c We don\u2019t need a string type\u201c, caused a bit of stir. Though the feedback is mixed, there is a common theme of a string being a useful feature. After doing a bit more research I can determine only one thing: most current string types are broken!\n Many of us believe our strings are capable of more than what they actually do. We rely on their functionality without actually checking that its valid. This can easily lead to programs which do not work correctly, particularly with respect to internationalization. In most cases it seems we would be better off without a string type.\n  I looked at how strings behave in a few basic situations. I\u2019ll go over each situation, giving the expected result and some of the actual results. I considered showing a matrix with the results, but since all the tested languages behave so poorly it didn\u2019t seem useful.\n  Using the text \u201cnoe\u0308l\u201d with a decomposed Unicode string \u201cnoe\\u0308l\u201d, I checked the following:\n 1. Does it print correctly? Yes, most languages are capable of doing this. Though the ideone.com interface seems to break the output (so be careful with testing).\n 2. What is the reverse? \u201cl\u00ebon\u201d, correct? Mostly this fails. The most common result is \u201cl\u0308eon\u201d (the dieresis is on the \u2018l\u2019 instead of the \u2018e\u2019). This is what happens without a string class, by just reversing an array of code points.\n 3. What are the first three characters? Mostly the answer here is \u201cnoe\u201d, as opposed to the desired \u201cno\u00eb\u201d. This could easily lead into a big discussion about what a character is, but I assume most people would not be happy with the current result. This is again indicative of a string type which merely treats the data as an array of code points.\n 4. What is the length? The common answer is 5. And yet again, this indicates our string types are merely arrays of characters and not truly handling the text.\n For all of these questions, try to consider what should happen if you were editing this text in your favourite word processor or text editor. I generally expect that the \u2018\u00eb\u2019 character is handled as a single entity. I don\u2019t expect backspace/delete to just remove part of the letter. I expect copying the first three letters to include the accent.\n  It was a bit weird to find out that Unicode has cats in it (I hope you have a font which shows them \u2014 if not, the title of this section is a happy cat and a sad cat, part of the Unicode emoticon set). These characters were chosen since they are outside of the BMP (basic multilingual plane). This spells trouble for languages using UTF-16 encodings (Java, C#, JavaScript).\n 1. Length? Python unicode correctly reports 2. Those UTF-16 languages tend to report 4: the characters require surrogate pairs.\n 2. Substring after the first character? Python unicode correctly reports the sad cat \u201c\ud83d\ude3e\u201d. The UTF-16 languages produce invalid strings with a half-surrogate followed by the sad cat.\n 3. Reverse? Python unicode gets the correct reverse of \u201c\ud83d\ude3e\ud83d\ude38\u201d. The UTF-16 languages produce invalid strings. With C# I think I uncovered a defect in ideone. It doesn\u2019t even show the invalid string and instead shows no output at all for the entire program! [ ideone defect]\n Languages using an encoding agnostic library, like C++, Perl, and normal Python 2 strings, fail here as well. They ignore any encoding and assume the string is an array of 1-byte code points. Python 3 adopted unicode as the default string type, thus fixing some problems. It appears that Perl also has a \u2018utf8\u2019 mode which fixes problems for these cats, but not for the \u201cno\u00ebl\u201d string.\n  This string contains a ligature character, the \u201cffl\u201d part is a single unicode code point. They exist mainly for compatibility, but they are a good test for case conversion.\n 1. What is the uppercase? I did not find any language which doesn\u2019t print \u201cBA\ufb04E\u201d. Notice the ligature remains lowercase. The expected answer is of course \u201cBAFFLE\u201d.\n Unicode has a special class of case conversion: this single ligature code point is actually converted to three code points. By not following these additional rules, a language uppercase function produces an interesting result: a string converted to uppercase still has lowercase characters in it.\n  A final check I did was to compare two logically equivalent strings with different composition forms. Here \u201cno\u00ebl\u201d is using the precomposed \u201c\u00eb\u201d character.\n 1. Is precomposed == decomposed? The answer is no in all tests. However, several languages do offer Unicode normalization libraries. In those languages the normal form of the strings does compare equal. JavaScript does not have such a library, which is really tragic because it\u2019s primarily a UI language, exactly where\u2019d you want proper unicode functionality.\n It\u2019s tempting to argue that normalization and lexical analysis is not part of the basic string type. But these seem like fundamental operations one would want to do with text. If they aren\u2019t included, what exactly is the purpose of the string type?\n  I encourage you to run such tests in your favourite language. If you are doing work with international text it is vital that you understand what your \u2018string\u2019 type is actually doing. Once you\u2019ve run this you should reconsider what your \u201cstring\u201d type is actually doing for you. In my opinion they\u2019re all broken.\n I admit the correct answer is not always clear. Text processing is a difficult topic, and at the very minimum we\u2019d have to cover grapheme clusters (some string classes expose functionality relating to this, and Perl even has a GCString class). This is beyond the scope of this article, but very relevant for a good string type.\n The point I made in my previous article becomes more poignant. I\u2019d rather have an array of characters than a broken string class. I don\u2019t put any false expectations on an array of characters: the results it produces for the above tests are very logical.

Clinically, the life-long presence of the parasite in tissues of a majority of infected individuals is usually considered asymptomatic. However, a number of studies show that this \u2018asymptomatic infection\u2019 may also lead to development of other human pathologies.\n The purpose of the study was to collect available geoepidemiological data on seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis and search for its relationship with mortality and disability rates in different countries.\n Prevalence data published between 1995\u20132008 for women in child-bearing age were collected for 88 countries (29 European). The association between prevalence of toxoplasmosis and specific disease burden estimated with age-standardized Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) or with mortality, was calculated using General Linear Method with Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDP), geolatitude and humidity as covariates, and also using nonparametric partial Kendall correlation test with GDP as a covariate. The prevalence of toxoplasmosis correlated with specific disease burden in particular countries explaining 23% of variability in disease burden in Europe. The analyses revealed that for example, DALY of 23 of 128 analyzed diseases and disease categories on the WHO list showed correlations (18 positive, 5 negative) with prevalence of toxoplasmosis and another 12 diseases showed positive trends (p&lt;0.1). For several obtained significant correlations between the seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis and specific diseases/clinical entities, possible pathophysiological, biochemical and molecular explanations are presented.\n The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis correlated with various disease burden. Statistical associations does not necessarily mean causality. The precautionary principle suggests however that possible role of toxoplasmosis as a triggering factor responsible for development of several clinical entities deserves much more attention and financial support both in everyday medical practice and future clinical research.\n Toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by the obligate apicomplexan intracellular protozoan  Toxoplasma gondii, is one of the world&#39;s most common parasites infecting most genera of warm-blooded animals (more than 30 species of birds and 300 species of mammals). It is the most prevalent infection in humans (estimated to be 30\u201350% of the world population), more than latent tuberculosis which infects about one-third of the human population (WHO,  www.who.int/entity/tb/publications/2009/tbfactsheet_2009update_one_page.pdf, accessed July 2013). The definitive hosts are representatives of the felid (cat) family. Nicolle and Manceaux (1908) first observed the parasites in the blood and tissues of a North African rodent,  Ctenodactylus gondii, and named it  Toxoplasma (arclike form)  gondii (after the rodent host)  [1]. There are three infective stages of  T. gondii: a) a rapidly dividing invasive tachyzoite; b) a slowly dividing bradyzoite in tissue cysts, which can persist inside human cells for protracted periods; and c) an environmental stage, the sporozoite, protected inside an oocyst. The oocysts, remarkably stable environmentally, are transmitted to other hosts through inadvertent ingestion.\n Seroprevalence is a measure of the accumulated exposure during a person&#39;s lifetime in a particular social setting. Most of the more than one third of the world&#39;s human population who are infected with  T. gondii remain asymptomatic because the immune system usually keeps the parasite from causing illness. Chronic, usually lifelong, infection with  Toxoplasma that is not accompanied with overt clinical symptoms of toxoplasmosis disease is termed latent toxoplasmosis while chronic infection associated with continuous or recurrent clinical symptoms is termed chronic toxoplasmosis (this form of disease is relatively rare in Europe and Northern America). Worldwide seroprevalence of the parasite measured by specific anti- Toxoplasma IgG antibodies varies between 1% and 100% depending on the environmental and socioeconomic conditions, including eating habits and health-related practices  \u2013 , general level of hygiene, host susceptibility, geographical location (geolatitude) and humidity of the soil. The incidence of infection is higher in warmer and humid climates and increases with age  . The lowest seroprevalence (\u223c1%) was found in some countries in the Far East and the highest (&gt;90%) in some parts of European and South American countries. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported an overall seroprevalence of 11% [National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey between 1999 and 2004]; another survey reported a higher number (22.5%)  . Nevertheless, toxoplasmosis is one of the leading causes of death attributed to foodborne illness  . In European countries, the prevalence ranges between 10% to 60%, and in some regions as high as 90%  [8]. In one study, 84% of pregnant women had serum antibodies against the parasite  [3]. Data from 88 countries are presented in   Table 1; most of the published data on seroprevalence are in women of childbearing age and/or those who are pregnant.\n The second and third column show prevalence of toxoplasmosis and prevalence adjusted to a standard age of 22 years to account for variation in childbearing age in across countries (column 1) using the formula Prevalence adj\u200a=\u200a1\u2212(1\u2212Prevalence)\u2227(22/childbearing age)  . Column 5 shows year(s) when the study was performed and column 6 shows number of women in the sample. For Macedonia, the 2004 WHO data were not available therefore this 30 th European country was not included in our data set.\n In the majority of the human populations, the parasite seroprevalence increases with age, and may vary by gender  ,  [94]. Latitudinal variability in the geoseroprevalence of the parasite may be due to local rainy conditions (because oocysts live longer in humid conditions), and low altitude regions (especially at mid-latitudes); a north-south seroprevalence gradient has also been reported in animals  ,  ,  .\n The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis is high in immunocompromised patients, such as those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and transplant or cancer patients treated with immunosuppressive agents  ,  ,  .\n It may be pointed out that the different serological methods used to obtain prevalence data are not standardized, and vary in sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. As a consequence, no two tests produce the same results in all cases, even when carried out in the same laboratory  .\n T. gondii strains are highly diverse but only a few lineages are widely spread. Different genotypes of the parasite show great diversity in pathogenicity and drug sensitivity. Some atypical strains have also been detected. In Europe, North America, and Africa, there are three dominant clonal lineages of  T. gondii called type I (RH, GT1,CAST), type II (ME49, WIL, HART), and type III (VEG, MOO, SOU), as well as many atypical genotypes which differ in prevalence, virulence, migratory capacity within the host, and ability to convert to the bradyzoite cyst phase  \u2013 . Different strains of the parasite induce different cytokine responses  , thus triggering development of various clinical and biochemical disturbances in the host, including modulation of the host cell proteome  ,  . Mice fed as few as 1 oocyst of  T. gondii serotype I and several atypical strains died of acute toxoplasmosis within 21 days post inoculation, while some  T. gondii type II, and III strains were less virulent  . In North America, the parasite serotype II and NE-II causes congenital toxoplasmosis, while prematurity and severity of disease at birth was associated with the coccidian NE-II serotype  . This serotype was also associated with rural residence, lower socioeconomic status and Hispanic ethnicity (P&lt;0.01\u20130.001)  . A greater variety of genotypes are found in South America and Africa than in North America and Europe  ,  , suggesting that in these continents sexual replication of the parasite occurs more frequently than in any other part of the world  . This genetic divergence may contribute to the higher prevalence of seropositivity and ocular disease due to  T. gondii, as exemplified by the higher prevalence of toxoplasmosis and  Toxoplasma-induced eye disease in southern Brazil than in any other part of the world  .\n Animals are infected by eating infected animals, by ingestion of or coming in contact with feces of an infected cat, or by transmission from mother to fetus. In humans, cats are the primary source of infection (contact with fecal material), but other pets may also be the secondary source of infection  [3],  ,  [112]. The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in the Arctic region proves that  T. gondii can thrive in the absence of cats  [113].\n Contact with raw meat of infected animals, especially pork, is a more significant source of human infections in some countries, such as in Poland, where the majority of pigs, cattle and sheep (approximately 80%) test positive for  T. gondii [8],  . Transmission of the parasite can also occur by drinking municipal/well unboiled and unbottled water containing oocysts, exposure to contaminated soil, contaminated milk, exposure of children playing in sandpits, geophagia  ,  , eating raw or undercooked meat, especially venison   or rabbits  , raw oysters, clams, or mussels  , consumption of unwashed raw fruits and vegetables contaminated with the oocytes  , blood transfusion  \u2013 , maternal-fetal passage of blood cells (including placental trophoblasts)  [123],  , solid organ allografts  ,  , bone marrow transplantation  , allogeneic stem cell transplantation  , sputum  , breast milk  ,  , and semen   (thus, probably the infection may be transmitted via both vaginal and oral sex, significantly more frequently from seropositive to passive sex partner than vice-versa (P&lt;0.001)  [133]). Poor hygiene, lower socioeconomic status and less education, as well as exposure to certain strains of  T. gondii may also contribute to a higher rate of infection  .\n T. gondii is remarkable in its ability to invade a wide variety of host cells. Invasion is an active process relying on parasite motility and the sequential secretion of proteins from secretory organelles, the micronemes, rhoptries, and the dense granules.  T. gondii can invade and multiply inside any nucleated cell type including epithelial cells and blood leukocytes  . A preference to infect and multiply inside myeloid cells  in vitro has also been reported  , and several studies in mice indicate that the dendritic cells as well as monocytes/macrophages function as systemic parasite transporters (\u201cTrojan horses\u201d) during infection  \u2013 . The parasite can be transmitted from infected dendritic cells to NK cells  , and thus, low levels of NK cells found in pregnant women may suggest transmission of the parasite  . Differential infectivity and division rate of intracellular tachyzoites in human peripheral blood leukocytes and other primary human cells  in vitro has been demonstrated depending on the cell characteristics  .\n It is believed that the majority of immunocompetent individuals infected with  T.  gondii remain asymptomatic or have a subclinical course with minor symptoms  . It is nevertheless the most common food-borne parasitic infection requiring hospital treatment  , and the third most common cause of hospitalization due to food-borne infection  . Both competent and immunocompromised persons can develop the disease, especially retinochoroiditis (ocular toxoplasmosis)  ,  ,  . In non-pregnant immunocompetent adults, acute disease may also lead to impaired eye sight  ,  . For example, in the United States, one million new infections occur each year, which result in approximately 20 000 cases of retinal pathology  . Primary infection in pregnant women is a matter of great concern, since it can be transmitted to the fetus leading to spontaneous abortion or stillbirth. A newborn exposed to  T. gondii in utero may develop congenital toxoplasmosis with major ocular and neurological consequences. In immunosuppressed (HIV, organ transplant or cancer) patients, the infection can lead to life-threatening cerebral toxoplasmosis  ,  ,  .\n Symptomatic infection with the parasite can be categorized into four groups: 1) cervical lymphadenopathy, headache, fever, sore throat, and myalgia, with possibility of splenomegaly and brief erythematous (maculopapular) rash; 2) typhus-like exanthematous form with myocarditis, meningoencephalitis, atypical pneumonia and possibly death; 3) retinochoroiditis, which may be severe, requiring enucleation; and 4) central nervous system involvement  [153]. In addition, several reports suggest that  T. gondii infection may be responsible for additional wide range of symptoms, and development of several clinical entities (summarized in   Table 2).\n  Some of the clinical manifestations of  T. gondii infection may be as a result of extensive interaction of the pathogen with approximately 3000 host genes or proteins possibly because of frequent host/pathogen antigen homology that disrupts/creates/triggers host specific metabolic pathways, and finally contributes to the development of endophenotypes of different diseases  . The parasite and concomitant viral and/or bacterial infections scavenge important metabolites from host cells and/or donate other compounds to the host causing unwanted effects. In addition,  T. gondii-derived autoantibodies also play an important role in the pathology associated with the parasite  .\n Due to the fact that  T. gondii infection is omnipresent and associated with development of many pathologies in humans and animals, including the disease burden of congenital toxoplasmosis, as represented by disability-adjusted life years (DALY) being the highest among all foodborne pathogens  , the purpose of this work was to collectively evaluate available geoepidemiological data on the parasite worldwide national seroprevalence variations and their relationship with mortality and disability rates. In the analyses, gross domestic product (GDP)  per capita as a covariate was used because earlier it was argued and demonstrated that culture-level correlations need to be controlled for regional socioeconomic parameters  ,  ,  . If possible (i.e. in multivariate GLM analyses), two potential confounding variables that could strongly influence both the survival of  Toxoplasma oocysts in soil and a course of various diseases, namely the average latitude (proxy for temperature) and the average relative humidity of particular countries have also been included into the statistical models. In this study we found many positive and some negative associations between the prevalence of toxoplasmosis and various diseases burdens. The number and strength of these associations were much higher than could be expected by chance. Still, it must be emphasized that statistical association does not mean causality. Based on the finding of a statistical association between two phenomena, one cannot determine which of them is the cause and which is the effect \u2013 in other words, whether event A causes event B, or whether event B causes event A. Not only we are unable to determine whether event A causes B, or B causes A, but sometimes there is an (unknown) event C that causes both A and B. Therefore, all effects observed in the present exploratory study as well as all suggested biological or medical interpretations must be considered just as potential stimuli for the next, more focused research (search for unknown confounders and for independent evidence) that must follow.\n The data on disease burden, mortality and Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY), were obtained from the table \u201cMortality and Burden of Diseases Estimates for WHO Member States in 2004\u201d published by WHO  [323] and available at:  www.who.int/evidence/bod. The publication can be downloaded from the website:  http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/2004_report_update/en/index.html; accessed July 2013). Summary tables present the best estimates of WHO \u2013 based on the evidence available in mid-2008 \u2013 rather than from the official estimates of Member States.  Methods and data sources are summarized in the Annexes of the \u201cGlobal burden of disease: 2004 update\u201d  [323], and the methodology used is described in more details elsewhere  [324]; also available at:  http://www.dcp2.org/pubs/GBD; accessed July 2013.\n The Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) has been defined  [323] as \u201ca health gap measure that extends the concept of potential years of life lost due to premature death and also to include equivalent years of \u2018healthy\u2019 life lost by virtue of being in a state of poor health or disability.\u201d Thus, the DALY combines in one measure the time lived with disability and the time lost due to premature mortality. One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of \u2018healthy\u2019 life, while the \u2018burden of disease\u2019 as a measure of the gap between current health status and an ideal situation where everyone lives into old age free of disease and disability. The method of calculation of age-standardized DALY has been described earlier  [323].\n In the literature, most of toxoplasmosis prevalence (seroprevalence) data are available only for women in childbearing age. Therefore, all available data collected for this population were published mostly between 1995\u20132008; the final database was obtained from 88 countries (29 European). When more than one estimation of prevalence of toxoplasmosis was available for a particular country, we gave priority to multicenter studies performed between 1998\u20132004. When the studies published different prevalence data for various regions or different years we calculated an unweighted arithmetic mean. The obtained data were adjusted to a standard age 22 years to eliminate differences in prevalence caused by different childbearing ages in various countries   were kindly provided by Mudhakar Dama) using the formula:\n All statistical tests except partial Kendall correlation test were performed independently with SPSS 21 and Statistica 10.0. The association between seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis and specific disease burden estimated with age standardized DALY was calculated using nonparametric partial Kendall correlation test  [326],   with Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDP) as covariate. Because the results of similar analyses performed with the General Linear Model (GLM) method were qualitatively the same, GLM data were primarily interpreted in the Discussion section of present study. The GLM is more sensitive for the quality of data (e.g. to presence of outliers and non-Gaussian distribution of data, etc.), however, it enables to control for more than one covariate. In the present analysis, we controlled for GDP, geographical latitude and annual mean of relative humidity of particular countries using data available at  http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD (accessed 10.12. 2013) and  http://www.climatemps.com/ (accessed 2.4. 2013). No formal corrections for multiple tests were carried out, however, the fraction of significant results largely exceeded a theoretical value of 5 false positive results per 100 tests.\n The medical importance of the association was expressed as regression coefficient \u2018B\u2019, the slope of the regression line. The higher is the absolute value of B the greater is the positive or negative impact of the predictor variable (here prevalence of toxoplasmosis)\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-23 10:00:48", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5168\u7403,global,\u6570\u636e", "title": "\u5f13\u5f62\u866b\u75c5 -

Best to keep a pad of paper and a pencil at your bedside, so you can stab them during the night before they get away.\n   Writing with pen is the first skill you learn in school. It is also one of the most important skills you learn in life, because writing enables you to  record your thoughts and send them to another human. Your thought may effect a person that is thousands of kilometres away, and even hundreds years in the future. Recording thoughts is the most powerful technology our civilization ever created. And without writing, well, there wouldn&#39;t be any human civilization. Writing is here to stay, so we might look at  how we can improve it.\n Let&#39;s look at one specific mode of writing that people often do. You have a problem that can be expressed as an  algebraic expression. For example you are a carpenter and you want to know volume of piece of wood that is 13cm by 13cm by 1m. Or you want to know price of 3kg of bananas if 1kg is for 2.44\u20ac. Or you want to know how much money you&#39;ll have in 10 years when you start with 1000\u20ac and 3.5% annual growth. This is  basic math that you can do with  pen and paper without even using a calculator. However, calculator is equally useful tool as pen and paper because you can think faster by  automating the boring parts. Okay, so let&#39;s look at some concrete example of this workflow:\n  You write down the expression and then you have to  type it in the calculator. You&#39;ll probably do it by writing down  partial results and typing them in the calculator to get the final result. This is a slow process that can be eased by using calculator with parentheses \u2013 you retype the expression  char-by-char and you have your answer. Nowadays people don&#39;t really carry around physical calculators, but we have something  more powerful \u2013 a computer. Computers have  many forms \u2013 one can be a handheld calculator with touchscreen, which you could use in tandem with pen and paper to solve our math problem. Or you know, use  pen and paper that  are computers.\n  So let&#39;s write our problem again. This time with  modern versions of our beloved tools.\n  We have black paper and white ink. Such innovation! But it  looks identical as our first try. Even though we use computerized pen and paper, the new medium acts the same way as one that is 5000 years old. Thanks to  machine learning, computers are now able to  understand our handwriting, so we can enhance our pen and paper to be  smart!\n  As you can see, this isn&#39;t great. The transcribed text has  errors. We tried to write it in  one shot and the handwriting looks ugly, so the recognition result wasn&#39;t as good. Maybe if we try to  write it by chunks, we might get it right.\n  Entering text on computer is usually done with  caret navigation \u2013 a  blinking vertical line designates an  insertion point \u2013 if you press a letter on a keyboard, it will be inserted at that position. With this mode we are  mixing in different input system \u2013  keyboard \u2013 into our pen and paper land, but at least we can write what we wanted... However we lost the original form of our handwritten thought and we are left only with printed characters. We can do a bit better.\n  This was much  better experience than the previous one. And we have  both representations at the same time \u2013 original handwritten form, and also derived printed form that was  generated after each stroke. Even though there was a lot of computation going on during the scribbling, we still  don&#39;t know the answer of our math  question. So let&#39;s try one more time.\n  Finally, this is it \u2014  we have everything we need. We have our  original scribbles, which get translated into  printed letters. On top of that, the computer recognized it is an algebraic formula and  highlighted numbers and operators with  different colors. Not only printed characters, but also individual  strokes. And along the scribbling, we had formula evaluated the whole time. As soon as we  finished last stroke on our problem statement, we already  had the solution.\n   This new kind of paper  understands what you are writing and try to be smart about  what you want. So what can it do?\n it knows  glyphs that are  not on your keyboard, such as these:  \u00f7 \u2211 \u2a02 \u2234 \u2192 \u2190 \u203d \u03b2\n    it has  unit conversion built in, so  3km \u00f7 26m will be evaluated to  4.62km/h, and also you can ask for  m/s\n it knows all  functions ( sin,  cos,  log,  pow, etc.), all  constants (\u03c0, \u210f, etc.), all useful  formulas\n it can  display graphics such as graphs, plots, diagrams, images or even  interactive ball-and-stick model of a chemical compound\n it is  programmable, i.e. you can write your own functions with  recursion,  conditionals and  loops\n In summary, it can do  a lot and it is  useful not only for simple math problems, but it has a real impact on  every scientific field. However it has  one fatal flaw \u2013 it doesn&#39;t exist yet. Various pieces of the tech exist, but they are not yet combined into this new  transformative medium.\n Computational capabilities that were mentioned in the feature list exist in  Wolfram Mathematica. Mathematica is a phenomenal piece of software, there isn&#39;t a single doubt about that. However it has its surface form, i.e. the  programming language, designed for a keyboard input method. Almost all languages for programming computers were  designed for keyboards because keyboards become standard part of computers early on.\n In the rich history of computer science there have been many  interesting experiments that were stolen straight from the  future. One of them was  RAND Tablet. Here you can see a full  demo of this marvel of technology.\n  It can  display and edit charts and also  source code of a program. And all  without any keyboard attached to it! Of course there are a few things that are plainly  wrong. For example, the surface for the pen and screen are separate. This was a downgrade from its predecessor,  Sketchpad, which even today looks like an  alien technology.\n  Sketchpad didn&#39;t have handwriting recognition. All textual input was done by a  keyboard. A  missed opportunity if you ask me. But Sketchpad started a  revolution named  Computer-aided design, which stood on strong graphical capabilities and direct manipulation of the content. Todays CAD systems have great software, but they are running on a  cheap knockoff of pen and paper \u2013 desktop computer with a keyboard and a mouse.\n RAND Tablet had  handwriting recognition that was based on  clever heuristic, i.e.  no machine learning, and it required person to write slightly different than it would normally write with a pen and paper. As you have seen in the demo, the text editing was  usuable, so it wasn&#39;t such a problem. However, if you paid close attention to the meaning of the text, you could see that it was  an assembly language. And that  was a problem. Assembly was designed for keyboard input, so editing it with a pen must have felt  weird and unproductive.\n This gets us to the question:  Are there any programming languages that were designed for pen and paper? Yes, there was.  A Programming Language, also known as  APL. A language that started as a  notation that was designed for  human-to-human communication of computer programs, usualy written with pen on a paper, or  chalk on a blackboard. To be fair, even APL suffered the  transition from blackboard to keyboard. Original notation had sub-/superscripts and flow of the program was depicted with lines. When APL became a programming language, it was  linearized, lost its flowchart-like visual, but kept its  exotic glyphs. This was possible by using a  special keyboard and printer that could print those characters. ( source)\n What set APL aside from other programming languages was its overal  unified design. It was an array-oriented language \u2013 it had the array as a first-class construct. Operation  Array.map that you may know from functional programming was  implicit in APL. Adding 1 to an array of numbers was  same as adding 1 to one number. This array-orientation and  tersness of the notation ultimately led to a much  higher-level operational semantics than other languages had in that era. Today, there is a family of APL languages, but the community is rather small and divided. Some APL ideas percolated down the history to the  modern tensor/array-oriented differentiable programming, such as  PyTorch, with which a computer can learn to recognize your handwriting.\n  It seems that pen and paper will finally get a deserved computational upgrade that was in the works for quite some time. And that is good because it is still  the greatest medium to think with. But there are still a million questions to be asked on how to  properly design it. Is there the one  ultimate notation that can span from children to sciece gurus? Should the interactions and language of this new medium be standardized and taught in school? What would happen if children would use differentiable programming from the start? How can we ensure that the medium would be  proactive in teaching the person? Would simple  collaboration between its users be enough for it? I don&#39;t have these answers yet. But I will try to uncover them by making this  new kind of paper a reality.\n Next post will describe  how to make an app for  offline handrwiting recognition with Google Colab, PyTorch, CoreML tools and Swift.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 10:00:03", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u65b0\u7eb8,kind", "title": "\u65b0\u7eb8 ", "title_en": "New Kind of Paper", "transed": 1, "url": "https://mlajtos.mu/posts/new-kind-of-paper", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u65b0\u7eb8", "kind"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "43c5843d5e9acfc5628fb423d622f778.jpg", "infoid": 1067615, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u66fe\u7ecf\u7531\u4e00\u6b3e\u591a\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u516c\u5f00\u4ea4\u6613\u5fb7\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5e0c\u671b\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u65b0\u4ea7\u54c1\u7cfb\u5217\u4f7f\u7528\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5546\u6807\u3002\n \u6211\u95ee\u4ed6\u4eec\u613f\u610f\u4ee5\u6362\u53d6\u8bb8\u53ef\u534f\u8bae\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u5c11\u3002\u5728\u4e0b\u9762\u7684\u56de\u590d\u4e2d\uff0c\u60a8\u4f1a\u770b\u5230\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u77e5\u6211\uff0c\u516c\u53f8\u653f\u7b56\u7981\u6b62\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e3a\u6b64\u8d54\u507f\u6211\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f88\u4e50\u610f\u8986\u76d6\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8d39\u7528\u3002\n \u7ffb\u8bd1\uff1a\u4ed6\u4eec\u60f3\u7528\u6211\u7684\u5546\u6807\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7edd\u5bf9\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u56de\u62a5\u3002\n   \u8fd9\u662f\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u6212\u6307\u4e2d\u670917\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5bf9\u4e1c\u897f\u611f\u5230\u5bbe\u5915\u6cd5\u5c3c\u4e9a\uff1a\n  \u4ed6\u4eec\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5bc4\u7ed9\u6211125,000\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u73b0\u91d1\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u4e5f\u83b7\u5f97\u4e8610\u5e74\uff0c\u514d\u7248\u7a0e\u7684\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u7b54\u590d\u3002\u5728Layman\u7684\u6761\u6b3e\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u5c06\u60a8\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\u9500\u552e\u5230\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u672a\u676510\u5e74\u514d\u8d39\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\n \u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u53e4\u8001\u7684\u683c\u8a00\uff0c\u8bf4\u4f60\u4f1a\u64c5\u957f\u4f60\u505a\u7684\u6700\u591a\u3002\u6211\u7ecf\u5e38\u7528\u5b83\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53cd\u5bf9\u574f\u4e60\u60ef\u7684\u8b66\u544a\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4e5f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6280\u80fd\u5efa\u8bbe\uff1a\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u60f3\u8981\u4f1f\u5927\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u7ecf\u5e38\u505a\u3002\n \u6211\u8c08\u5224\u4e00\u5207\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\uff0c\u591a\u5e74\u6765\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f88\u64c5\u957f\u3002\u6709\u4e9b\u4eba\u4e3a\u5b83\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5929\u7136\u7684\u8bc0\u7a8d\uff0c\u4f46\u7edd\u5bf9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u3002\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e9b\u6700\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff1a \n\u8c08\u5224\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u65f6\u95f4\u662f\u5728\u5b63\u5ea6\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6 -

In their response below, you\u2019ll see them inform me that\u00a0company policy prohibits them from compensating me for it, but they\u2019d be happy to cover reasonable legal fees.\n Translation: they wanted to use my trademark and they were offering me absolutely nothing in return.\n   Here\u2019s how they felt about things after 17 months in the ring with yours truly:\n  Not only did they send me a check for $125,000 cash, but I also secured a 10 year, royalty-free license-back agreement. In layman\u2019s terms, that\u2019s the equivalent of selling your car with the condition that you can keep using it for free for the next 10 years.\n There\u2019s an old adage that says you\u2019ll get good at what you do the most. I usually use that as a warning against bad habits, but it also applies to skill building: if you want to be great at something, do it as often as possible.\n I negotiate everything and, as a result, I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at it over the years. Some people have a natural knack for it but it is definitely a skill that can be learned. I\u2019ve laid out some of my favorite tips below:\n  The best time to negotiate is at the end of a quarter \u2013 the last few days of March, June (hey, that\u2019s RIGHT NOW), October, and December. Most sales reps are reviewed based on quarterly performance, so they\u2019re looking to lock up as many deals as possible before the quarter closes out. If you\u2019re up for a contract renewal of any sort, try to sign the documents at the end of the quarter.\n It\u2019s worthwhile to note that some companies fiscal year is not the same as a calendar year. If you\u2019re negotiating a major contract, do some research and see where their quarters fall.\n  Never, ever give a target price. If a salesman asks you, \u201chow much are you looking to spend?\u201d you should respond, \u201cas little as possible to get what I need.\u201d\n Target prices allow the other party to quote you a price just below what you\u2019re willing to spend. It feels like you\u2019re getting a deal, but they may have been able to go a lot lower.\n  Email negotiation is more comfortable, but it also gives the other person the time to carefully think about options. It\u2019s also much harder for someone to tell you \u201cno\u201d in person.\n  After they make their first offer \u2013 \u201cI can do this deal for $500\u201d \u2013 you should reply only with a wince (in person) or a gasp (on the phone). Then, say nothing and just endure the awkwardness that follows.\n They\u2019ll soon follow up with a better offer \u2013 sometimes multiple ones (\u201cOK, $400, well I can probably do $350 or as low as $325\u201d). When you think they\u2019ve bottomed out, start negotiating.\n  I\u2019ve been through hundreds of negotiations. If you start at $200 and they start at $400, you\u2019re probably going to end up around $300. \u00a0It\u2019s bizarre, but this is just how it works.\n  This one is huge. Never, ever do their selling for them. \u201cI know your product is great\u201d or \u201cI see that you have features x, y, and z\u201d are things that you say when you\u2019re feeling uncomfortable in a negotiation. Resist the temptation to save the salesperson from the awkward moment. Remember: the awkwardness comes right before they start dropping prices.\n  Once you\u2019ve gotten them as far as they\u2019ll go, make your final offer \u2013 always in the form of a statement, not in the form of a question: \u201cIf you can do $200, I can fax the paperwork today.\u201d\n  Setup fees can almost always be waived. You\u2019ll find that most of these fees are just extra moneymakers for the company \u2013 very few contracts require significant setup time.\n   Getting 1 or 2 months free may feel good, but it\u2019s usually not a great deal overall. The first month free on a 2 year contract is less than a 5% savings.

The company, launched in 2014, has now raised $250 million altogether, including from, Deutsche B\u00f6rse, Temasek, Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas, and Munich Re. It acquired rival SharesPost last year for  $160 million in cash and stock. According to the company, it now has more than $14 billion in assets under custody.\n Prasad and Ramadurgam \u2014 who helped hire Forge CEO Kelly Rodriques back in 2018 \u2014 say they\u2019re excited about that success. They still own a stake in the company; they remain non-voting board members.\n  But after spending 18 months as co-president of Forge at the outset of Rodrigues\u2019s tenure, they left early last year to begin tinkering on a new idea, one that Prasad says is centered around giving a much wider pool of people access to private company shares. Called  D/XYZ (pronounced \u201cDestiny\u201d), the idea is to enable any investor \u2014 not just the 1% \u2014\u00a0 to invest in startups whose services they use and love.\n  Unfortunately, the two aren\u2019t offering much more of a curtain raiser than that right now, though Prasad suggests D/XYZ is neither a new fund nor a crowdfunding vehicle. It\u2019s also not selling any tokens, we gather. Instead, Prasad hints at an entirely new product, saying the company is being cautious in how much it shares publicly because it first wants to \u201cget the go-ahead from regulators, as well as to ensure we have a clear path to market,\u201d he says.\n In the meantime, the two have raised $5 million in seed funding from numerous founders who like the idea of making private company shares easier for their parents, friends, customers, partners, and everyone else who likes what they\u2019re building. Among the round\u2019s participants is Coinbase cofounder Fred Ehrsam; Plaid cofounder and CEO Zach Perret; Quora and Expo cofounder Charlie Cheever; Superhuman founder and CEO Rahul Vohra; and serial entrepreneur Siqi Chen, who most recently founded a finance software company called Runway.\n As for some of the nascent startup\u2019s most obvious competition, Prasad doesn\u2019t sound concerned. Asked, for example, about Carta, a well-funded company that helps private companies and their employees manage and sell their stock and options and that has long talked about democratizing access to private company shares, Prasad says it remains very much a direct competitor instead to Forge given that both cater first and foremost to companies, not individuals.\n  And what of SPACs, the special purpose acquisition companies that are moving private companies onto the public market faster, allowing (at least in theory) more people to access high-growth companies at earlier stages? It\u2019s a partial solution, says Prasad. But the way he sees it, \u201cSPACs are more a reflection that people want late-stage access to private tech and their best option right now is giving money to a SPAC manager who will hopefully find a promising company to merge with in two years or less.\u201d He calls them a \u201clayer of abstraction.\u201d\n Of course, there\u2019s also the question of whether Forge will be a friend of foe if whatever Prasad and Ramadurgam are building succeeds. Could their tech be sold back to their first company? Could Forge come to see them as a rival to its business?\n \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing now is not competitive,\u201d insists Prasad. \u201cIt\u2019s more picking up the mantle where we left off. Forge is focused on trading, custody, company solutions and data. It has built what some call boring plumbing.\u201d Now that the plumbing has been erected, it has \u201cenabled a lot of other interesting things to be built, too.\u201d\n So is D/XYZ working with Forge in some capacity? Prasad demurs. \u201cPotentially,\u201d he says.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 09:21:33", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u521b\u4e1a,cofounders", "title": "\u8fd9\u4e9bForge Cofounders\u53ea\u662f\u7b79\u96c6\u4e86500\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u9759\u6b62\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u521b\u4e1a\u516c\u53f8\u4e0a\u5de5\u4f5c ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tThese Forge cofounders just raised $5 million to work on a new, still-stealth investing startup\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/these-forge-cofounders-just-raised-5-million-to-work-on-a-new-still-stealth-investing-startup/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u521b\u4e1a"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067611, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters", "note_en": "When AMD unveiled &#34;Big Navi&#34;, now known as the Radeon RX 6000 series, the new GPU family brought with it support for Microsoft&#39;s nascent DirectX Ray Tracing. DXR adds photorealistic lighting, reflections and more visual effects to make games that support the technologies look more true to life. However, real-time ray tracing is an intensive task, and high resolution, complex effects can drag frame rates down into unplayable territory even on the most powerful of today&#39;s GPUs. AMD said not to fear though, as it had an upscaling solution in the works that would boost performance, while maintaining high image quality, and now  FidelityFX Super Resolution is here.\u00a0   The focus of AMD&#39;s FSR is to bring a major framerate boost by intelligently upscaling a lower-resolution input, combined with high-quality, high-resolution graphics\u00a0to games that need it. The idea of enhanced upscaling isn&#39;t all that dissimilar to the concept behind  NVIDIA&#39;s Deep Learning Super Sampling. At a high level, both technologies render a lower-resolution image and scale it up to a higher resolution for a sharper, more detailed overall image with better frame rates. While FidelityFX Super Resolution goes its own way without vendor lock-in or specialized hardware requirements, comparisons to DLSS 2.0 -- at least from image quality and performance standpoints -- are inevitable. The implementation, however, is wildly different.\u00a0  First of all, FidelityFX Super Resolution is vendor agnostic and requires no specialized hardware to work its magic. If a GPU can run the necessary compute shaders fast enough, there&#39;s no real technical limitation preventing FSR from being utilized. NVIDIA relied on Turing and Ampere&#39;s tensor cores to accelerate an AI model using temporal and spatial data to weave in detail where it isn&#39;t. The effect is pretty convincing, but it absolutely requires NVIDIA&#39;s proprietary core technology. That by itself has limited adoption. Instead, AMD uses just spatial data, meaning FSR relies solely on information related to the current frame instead of trying to blend multiple frames together as NVIDIA does.\u00a0    We&#39;ve already mentioned that FidelityFX Super Resolution doesn&#39;t require any specialized hardware, unlike DLSS 2.0. The result of that might be the most exciting thing about the technology: it works on both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs today. Some of the GPUs in the  supported hardware list are pretty old, and as a result AMD could be bringing some graphics processors back into relevance. That&#39;s got to be welcome news for enthusiasts who can&#39;t find the current generation of graphics cards in stock at their suggested retail prices.\u00a0   The full list goes all the way back to AMD&#39;s Polaris GPUs found in the Radeon RX 400 and 500 series, and GeForce GPUs based on the Pascal architecture found in the GeForce 10 series like the GTX 1050, and later. Even Intel&#39;s chief of GPUs, Raja Kodouri, said on Twitter that the Blue Team would at least  look into the tech\u00a0without making any big promises about what GPUs would support it and when.\u00a0  The other side of the coin is API support. Just like graphics hardware, software support extends back quite a ways. Not only is FSR available in DirectX 12, it&#39;s also available for DX11 games. Open-source APIs aren&#39;t left out of the mix, either, as Vulkan is also supported.\u00a0The only problem is that each game has to add support for FSR, and as of right now AMD hasn&#39;t added a global switch to force the technology on. We&#39;re hopeful that will change in the future, but for now, we&#39;ll take what we can get.\u00a0    AMD has four levels of quality for FSR: Ultra Quality, Quality, Balanced, and Performance. At the top, Ultra Quality reduces the vertical and horizontal resolution of an image by a factor of 1.3. By the time we make our way down to Performance, the input is just half the resolution in either direction compared to the output image, or just one quarter of the total number of pixels. Just like DLSS 2.0, there&#39;s a reduced burden on the GPU to draw a scene, allowing it to move forward and reconstruct the detail. In this table, AMD outlines each FSR mode, scale factor, and input resolution.\u00a0The scale factor below refers to the horizontal and vertical resolution, not the number of pixels drawn. For example, at 2,560 x 1,440 (around 3.69 megapixels), Ultra Quality results in a 2.18 megapixel image, which is just 60% of the detail at the start.\u00a0    A couple of these settings happen to match NVIDIA&#39;s input resolutions along the way. The Quality and Performance modes here match Quality and Performance resolutions in DLSS 2.0 games like  Control and  MechWarrior 5. It&#39;s too bad that no DLSS 2.0 games also support FSR, or there&#39;d be some real image quality comparison fodder. For now we&#39;ll just have to approximate it. While DLSS 2.0 has an even lower-resolution Ultra Performance mode, FSR focuses on drawing more details, and instead has the Ultra Quality mode at the top.\u00a0    After the image is rendered at its input resolution but before the HUD is drawn, the FSR algorithm, accelerated by the GPU, enhances the edges of objects and outputs at the target resolution. After the image goes through the sharpening filters to make objects stand out, the HUD gets applied at the target resolution, so that it doesn&#39;t look fuzzy or stretched.\u00a0   Because the scaling factors stretch so far downward, the expected performance improvement is pretty stratospheric.  AMD says that on average, enthusiasts can expect a 2.4x performance uplift -- more than double the frame rate -- from the Performance setting. This will improve performance when hefty effects are enabled, allow gamers to get the most from their high-refresh FreeSync displays, and could potentially make games playable on hardware that might not otherwise run it smoothly, something we&#39;ll investigate on the next page.\u00a0  Whatever the case and however you want to count the pixels, the next step in the process is to upscale the image. AMD says its upscaling process employs an &#34;advanced edge reconstruction&#34; algorithm, which is based on the spatial data before it goes to the render pipeline.\u00a0Let&#39;s take this native 4K image from Counterplay Games&#39;\u00a0 Godfall as a starting point. We captured all these images on a  Radeon RX 6800 XT, but it should be noted that the image quality on the NVIDIA side is pretty much identical to our eyes.\u00a0    In the native image, everything is what we&#39;d expect. Objects are sharp and well-defined as they should be in on an 8MP display. Let&#39;s take a look at what Ultra Quality does to that image when it&#39;s rendered at 2,953 x 1,662 and then upscaled up to 4K.    Without blowing the image up to 2x to find all the hard edges, or swapping back and forth between images, we&#39;re actually quite hard-pressed to find glaring differences. The stairs are a little more blurry, and perhaps there&#39;s not quite as much detail in the character&#39;s hair, but in motion it&#39;s basically indistinguishable.   Folks who are sensitive to DLSS 2.0&#39;s temporal artifacts (which we feel are pretty mild and are likely to go unnoticed by many gamers) won&#39;t find anything like that here, because FSR relies solely on spatial data -- the graphics driver knows where objects are in relation to the camera as part of the scene. We can see in still images that there&#39;s a little bit of difference in the image quality at 4K, but we&#39;re hard pressed to find it when the game is moving. If there&#39;s much of a performance boost, which we&#39;ll look into soon, enabling FSR at the Ultra Quality setting seems like a no-brainer in the games that will support it.\u00a0  Next up, let&#39;s jump to the other end of the spectrum and see what Performance FSR looks like. On a 4K UHD display, we&#39;re talking about a 1080p image, and on a 1440p monitor we&#39;re down to just 720p&#39;s worth of pixels at render time.\u00a0   Godfall is just one of the games getting FidelityFX Super Resolution support today. The full list includes seven launch titles in all:  22 Racing Series,  Anno 1800,  Evil Genius 2,  Godfall,  KingsHunt,  Terminator: Resistance, and  The Riftbreaker. Some of these titles, like  The Riftbreaker, are early access titles, but Anno 1800 has been around for a while and picks up FSR support post-launch.\u00a0  There are still two other settings we haven&#39;t looked at. For reasons that will become obvious on the next page, we&#39;re going to check out Quality next. As we mentioned, the 2,560 x 1,440 image produced by the FSR Quality mode matches DLSS 2.0&#39;s Quality mode&#39;s render resolution. Let&#39;s take a closer look at the image.\u00a0    This is really the point where AMD&#39;s and NVIDIA&#39;s super scaling solutions should be compared, but that&#39;s not really possible until a game supports both technologies. Instead we can say that overall, it feels like FSR produces a softer image at the Quality setting than DLSS 2.0 does. Here&#39;s an example, and we&#39;ll start with FSR. If we really dig into the image here, it feels like our character on the left and the obelisk on the right are slightly out of focus. In motion, the game never feels that way because of constant motion, but in the still image it&#39;s apparent. For contrast, let&#39;s take a look at this scene from Remedy&#39;s  Control  rendered at 4K UHD on a  GeForce RTX 3070 with Quality DLSS 2.0. It has the same input resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 before upscaling, and we&#39;ve cropped it to 1080p the same as we did with\u00a0 Godfall.    It looks to us like Jessie Faden and her surroundings are a bit sharper and more in-focus in this image than the scenery in  Godfall,\u00a0but again in motion it&#39;s not as apparent.\u00a0As we can see there are pros and cons to both approaches. DLSS 2.0 is sharper but hardware support is more limited, while FidelityFX Super Resolution seems a bit softer, but has much wider hardware support. Going forward we&#39;re hoping to see both technologies supported in a single game so we can really make a true apples-to-apples comparison between the two.\u00a0  Lastly is the Balanced setting. This renders around half-way between Quality and Performance, and renders at a resolution (2,259 x 1,270 when targeting 4K) that is  just\u00a0a bit higher than DLSS 2.0&#39;s Balanced mode (which renders at 2,227 x 1,253 with the same target).\u00a0    When targeting 4K with Balanced settings, AMD&#39;s goal was to provide better image quality than 1080p while providing better performance than rendering 1440p. With a target resolution right in between the two, it should be pretty easy to hit that goal. The level of detail is better than it would have been at 1080p as well, though it can&#39;t put back all the detail that&#39;s missing from a higher resolution. The image is softer than either of the Quality settings, too, so it&#39;s just one more step in a series of trade-offs. The best way to determine which setting to use with FSR is to play the game and experiment on your hardware, but we&#39;ll do some investigation of our own on the next page.\u00a0  That&#39;s a whole lot, but we&#39;ll do our best here to sum it up: thanks to the spatial data collected by AMD&#39;s algorithms, Quality FSR at 4K, which renders at 1440p, has even a smidge more detail than native 1440p rendering, because edges of objects get smoothed out. We still have to investigate performance, but the image quality trade-offs are something we think gamers will be happy to live with. The old saying goes that &#34;something is better than nothing&#34; but in this case, AMD&#39;s something is pretty solid, especially because it feels like it was built for lower-end hardware. In this era of shortages and high prices, hungry gamers will eat it up if it means they can play games at higher resolutions at the cost of a bit of detail.\u00a0  AMD says FSR is easy to integrate, as the company intends to make the shader source code available as part of the  GPUOpen project under the permissive MIT open-source software license. The company expects source to be published sometime in mid-July. While AMD points out that FSR doesn&#39;t use temporal data or specialized hardware, there&#39;s no per-game training required, it&#39;s also important to note that DLSS 2.0 -- which does use temporal data -- no longer requires per-game training, either.\u00a0    There are seven games that support FSR today. Those games are  22 Racing Series,  Anno 1800,  Evil Genius 2,  Godfall,  KingsHunt,  Terminator: Resistance, and  The Riftbreaker. Ubisoft&#39;s  Anno 1800 has been around for a while, originally released in April of 2019. Some of the other titles are much newer and, like  The Riftbreaker, are still in an early access stage. We&#39;d love to see other game makers take Ubisoft&#39;s example and bring FSR to older titles, particularly those that stress the graphics card.\u00a0    On top of that, there are 12 other games already confirmed for FSR, including huge high-profile titles like  FarCry 6, Farming Simulator 22,\u00a0 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3,\u00a0 Dota 2, and\u00a0 Resident Evil Village. In total, around 40 developers have signed on to support FSR in their upcoming titles. Those studios include Capcom, Obsidian Entertainment, Ubisoft, and Valve. On top of that, Microsoft\u00a0 has already confirmed\u00a0that FidelityFX Super Resolution will be coming to the Xbox Series S and Series X, too.\u00a0  Let&#39;s check out some performance next...",

", "note_en": "In a bid to bolster its claims as a crime-fighting tool, Ring deployed a tactic popular in the business world: influencer marketing. It selected a cadre of brand ambassadors, rewarded them with free gadgets and discount codes, and urged them to use their connections to promote the Santa Monica security camera startup via word of mouth.\n  \u201cYou are killing it, by the way. Your code has 14 uses, eleven more and I will be sending you every device that we sell,\u201d a Ring employee wrote to one officer in a 2016 email. \u201cDo you have any community meetings or crime prevention fairs coming up?\u201d\n Ring provided at least 100 LAPD officers with one or more free devices or discount codes and encouraged them to recommend the company\u2019s web-connected doorbells and security cameras, emails reviewed by The Times reveal. In more than 15 cases, emails show that officers who received free gadgets or discounts promoted Ring products to fellow police officers or members of the public.\n  For Ring, turning police into brand ambassadors helped spur the adoption of Ring doorbells while lending credibility to the company\u2019s claims that it was an effective crime-reduction solution.\n In return, participating officers got tens of thousands of dollars worth of free and discounted electronics and helped establish a network of personal surveillance cameras that the LAPD could tap into with much less red tape than the typical means of obtaining video footage.\n The practice, privacy and criminal justice experts warn, raises the question of whether LAPD officers were serving the public in their interactions with Ring, or if they were serving a private business and themselves.\n LAPD rules restrict the acceptance of gifts that could be seen as an attempt to influence the actions of officers. After a preliminary review of the emails, the department said officers did not appear to have violated agency rules.\n  An agency spokesperson said that although accepting free devices and personally recommending those products to community members did not violate the LAPD code of ethics, a paid endorsement would run afoul of agency rules.\n \u201cOf course, each situation is looked at on a case by case basis,\u201d Det. Meghan Aguilar, a spokesperson for the LAPD, said in a statement. \u201cIf there is something brought to the department\u2019s attention which appears to be misconduct, it will be referred to Professional Standards Bureau for investigation.\u201d\n It\u2019s unclear whether LAPD officers disclosed their arrangements with Ring to the public or fellow officers.\n Ring ended its law enforcement ambassador program, called Pillar, in 2019 and now works directly with community organizations, said Emma Daniels, a spokesperson for Ring, which Amazon acquired in 2018.\n  \u201cRing stopped donating to law enforcement and encouraging police to promote our products years ago,\u201d Daniels said in a statement. \u201cAs Ring has grown, our practices have evolved, and we are always looking for ways to better serve our customers and their communities.\u201d\n The Times reached out to each officer named in this story directly or through the union and the Police Department and did not receive any response by the time of publication.\n Tony Cheng, an assistant professor at UC Irvine\u2019s Department of Criminology, Law and Society, warned that the public probably would be unable to make a distinction between a personal recommendation from an officer who received a free or discounted Ring product and a paid endorsement. \u201cThat seems to be splitting hairs,\u201d Cheng said.\n The practice, he said, is a cause for concern both substantively and symbolically \u2014 freebies from private companies could give officers motives other than public service, and they could give the public the impression that recommendations from officers can\u2019t be trusted.\n  \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be put in the position to have to question or be skeptical about the quality of public safety advice that they\u2019re giving out in meetings, for example, which could be compromised by these private partnerships,\u201d Cheng said.\n  The brand ambassador model is simple. Give free merchandise to influential individuals, and turn them into a low-cost marketing team.\n Some brands court celebrities with huge followings; others look to people who aren\u2019t necessarily famous yet have influence in their own communities. A makeup artist with a social media presence might receive swag for posting about new eyeshadow palettes. A runner might get free shoes for talking about footwear on Facebook. And stylish Instagram users might land freebies if their feed has the right look.\n It\u2019s less common, however, for public servants to participate in the brand ambassador model.\n  Ring began its outreach to the LAPD during a period of growth. Founded in the Pacific Palisades garage of Jamie Siminoff in 2012, Ring was proving wrong critics who had doubted the startup during an appearance on the TV show \u201cShark Tank.\u201d As e-commerce took off and concerns about porch theft rose with it, consumers embraced Ring and other video doorbells. By 2016, the company had an estimated $155 million in sales, commanding 80% of the global video doorbell market. It was valued at $460 million, had amassed $209 million in venture capital funding and Siminoff, at the time, was eyeing a potential initial public offering of stock.\n  But Ring wasn\u2019t profitable. The company was also having  trouble proving definitively that its products helped reduce crime in neighborhoods \u2014 a marketing promise it sought to validate by working with the LAPD, among other police departments.\n Emails from 2016 reviewed by The Times and released via a public records request show that Ring deployed a standard playbook as it approached officers across LAPD stations.\n  Often, Ring would make contact with an officer at an event or through introductions from fellow police. Then came a follow-up, with a request for a phone call to discuss ways to \u201creduce crime\u201d in their neighborhoods. Finally, Ring thanked the officer for the call and said a free product was on its way.\n In at least 24 cases, Ring emailed a discount code and encouraged an officer to share it with colleagues, prominent local individuals such as heads of neighborhood associations and residents of the communities they police.\n Ring\u2019s goal when sending free devices to officers was to let them experience it so they could \u201cspread the word about how this doorbell is proven to reduce crime in neighborhoods, spreading the word to HOA\u2019s, meeting groups, on Nextdoor, and at public safety meetings,\u201d one email from the company read.\n The LAPD\u2019s  code of ethics prohibits officers from accepting \u201cany gifts, gratuities or favors of any kind which might reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to influence their actions with respect to City business\u201d or using \u201ctheir position to secure directly or indirectly unwarranted privileges or exemptions for themselves or others.\u201d\n  The LAPD said using discount codes is \u201cgenerally not in conflict with our Code of Ethics.\u201d Aguilar also said recommending ways for community members to protect themselves is among the responsibilities of senior lead officers or officers in community relations positions \u2014 titles held by some of the officers named in this story who accepted free or discounted devices.\n  Although it\u2019s common for community members to ask officers for recommendations, Cheng, the UC Irvine professor, argues it\u2019s up to the officer to \u201cexercise restraint, according to the code of ethics.\u201d Officers could recommend security systems broadly, said Cheng, who reviewed some of the emails and pointed out that officers didn\u2019t just answer questions about recommendations, but proactively steered the public toward Ring.\n Ring quickly made inroads in the department, communicating with at least 125 officers in 2016.\n  In April of that year, after hearing about arrangements Ring made with other members of the LAPD, Officer Eric Mollinedo from the Olympic division emailed Ring\u2019s director of operations, August Cziment, asking for promo codes as well as information about receiving a unit for his home. Mollinedo said he\u2019d be manning a booth at an upcoming public safety fair. Cziment said Ring would get him \u201cgoing with flyers, as well as a unit.\u201d Ring also provided Mollinedo a coupon code and encouraged him to distribute it to his colleagues.\n After the fair, Mollinedo emailed Ring to let the company know the event was a success. \u201cWas a good day today at the Public Safety fair ... talked up Ring and had (5) officers/reserve officers purchase them!\u201d\n In at least 10 cases, officers invited Ring to community events or offered to schedule meetings at their stations primarily for the purpose of allowing company representatives to talk up products and hand out discount codes.\n That same month, Sgt. Justin Scott exchanged a series of emails with Cziment about an offer for a free stick-up camera. Ring asked him to share the offer with his entire West L.A. station. Scott agreed, saying he\u2019d keep the option to sign up for the free camera open for a month, and in that same message asked if he could get a replacement for a friend\u2019s Ring device \u201cthat appears defective.\u201d\n  Later that month, Scott ran promotional language by the company before sending it to fellow officers, emailing Cziment a block of text about the stick-up camera offer for his approval. Cziment replied, \u201cLooks great! Keep me updated on how it all goes.\u201d\n Of the 60 officers who responded to Scott\u2019s email asking for a free stick-up camera, four asked if they could also receive the Ring doorbell that the company gave out for free months prior because they had missed the opportunity at that time. At least three others asked for free stick-up cameras for other officers who didn\u2019t sign up in time. One asked for discounts for family members.\n At the time, the device retailed for $199, amounting to a conservative estimate of at least $12,000 in free hardware doled out at just one station.\n Requests for freebies kept coming. In one case, Officer Maria Gray, who was among the West L.A. police to receive a free stick-up camera, emailed Cziment to invite him to an upcoming station family picnic.\n  \u201cWe have a favor to ask... Every year, we have a West LA Division Beach party.... We use our measly station fund and buy some gifts to raffle off as prizes. Without me asking, do you see where I\u2019m going with this email? More importantly, we\u2019d love for you to come and attend. Bring some friends, our treat.\u201d\n Cziment wrote: \u201cWe\u2019d be happy to donate a Ring Doorbell and perhaps a new Solar Powered Security sign if that\u2019s of interest? :)\u201d\n Police invitations also extended to the top of the company: Siminoff, Ring\u2019s chief executive, attended a 2016 police academy graduation as a guest of then-LAPD Chief Charlie Beck.\n  Ring also encouraged officers to promote its products to residents of the communities they policed. The goal was to \u201cspread the word about how this doorbell is proven to reduce crime in neighborhoods,\u201d read one email from Ring offering a free device for an officer to try in his home.\n  Ring asked officers to help with its \u201cNeighborhood Pillar\u201d program, enlisting its LAPD contacts to \u201ceducate members of the community on the benefits of Ring\u201d by handing out promo codes and fliers to so-called pillars \u2014 \u201cinfluential people in the community that care about crime prevention safety.\u201d For every 10 uses of the code, the pillar would get a free Ring device.\n Community members Ring considered \u201cinfluential\u201d included neighborhood watch captains or presidents, one email showed. If the officers didn\u2019t know anyone who fit the bill, Ring invited the officers to take on the role of the pillar.\n  In an April 2016 email, Officer Evening Wight said a sergeant in her station had given her permission to share a Ring promo code, but \u201cshe cautioned me to word the email so that it won\u2019t appear that we are endorsing the product, merely offering it as an option among others for home security.\u201d\n  In a May 2016 email, Officer Javier Segovia said his sergeant and captain wanted Ring representative Phillip Dienstag to talk about Ring at an upcoming community meeting. But Segovia \u2014 who according to the emails had days prior received and installed a free Ring doorbell \u2014 advised that because the meeting was going to be held on city of Los Angeles property, the company would not be able to discuss \u201cpricing during the meeting.\u201d Instead, he wrote in the email, Dienstag would be able to \u201ctalk to the community on the side regarding pricing.\u201d\n Others went further in endorsing Ring to community members. Officer Alejandro Galvan said he was keeping an eye on his older neighbors, who were \u201cleery\u201d of technology, to see when their adult children would visit so he could talk them into persuading their parents to use a Ring device.\n &#34;(Psss, the weirdos have flip phones),\u201d Galvan wrote. \u201cI\u2019m thinking their kids might be able to \u2018intervene.\u2019\u201d\n In an email connecting Cziment with the head of the South Brentwood Residents Assn. at Ring\u2019s request, Gray \u2014 the officer who had invited Ring to the station family picnic \u2014 asked if the neighborhood group could find a way to work with the company. \u201cOur detectives use and support this product,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d be more than welcome to attend and help facilitate any meetings. I completely believe in and support this product!\u201d\n    By 2019, the brand ambassador model had evolved. Ring no longer encouraged officers to promote its products with the promise of free or discounted merchandise. Instead, there was a new incentive for officers: growing the network of surveillance devices that they could access more easily than typical security cameras.\n Ring at the time was trying to grow its app, called Neighbors. For consumers, the service works much like the community message board NextDoor but with an even greater focus on crime. Residents can share and comment on suspicious or suspected activity in their communities and also post footage from their own cameras.\n For law enforcement organizations, the app is an investigative tool. The app is given to law enforcement and public safety agencies free of charge, according to Ring\u2019s website. Officers get crime alerts sent to their inbox, and they can batch download or send mass requests to users for footage directly through the app. It featured an interactive map of all Ring devices in the area; Ring says it discontinued that service in 2019. In response to specific police data requests, consumers can consent to sharing their footage with investigators.\n   Aguilar said the LAPD and Ring do not have a formal contract. Terms for similar partnerships in other parts of the country show that as part of the agreement to use the law enforcement portal, officers have been required to \u201cencourage adoption of the platform/app,\u201d in their communities,  Motherboard reported.\n Emails to LAPD officers show Ring leaned on the brand ambassador model to grow its app. After installing the law enforcement portal, Ring instructed officers to ask community members to join the platform because it \u201cgrows in value with each resident that downloads the app.\u201d\n  Obtaining surveillance footage can be a cumbersome process. It can require knocking on doors and asking for permission from the owners of individual cameras, or at times seeking a warrant \u2014 which brings a level of transparency and judicial oversight. Using Ring\u2019s vast network, officers could instead request and obtain footage with a few clicks. Emails to Ring show LAPD officers requested access to the company\u2019s investigative tool as soon as it was available to them, praised it and quickly put it to use.\n  \u201cNo more going door to  door to look for cameras and asking for footage,\u201d  Ring\u2019s instructional video shared with police departments states.\n In June 2020, some Ring users received an email notifying them that LAPD Det. Gerry Chamberlain was seeking video recordings from the Black Lives Matter protests, emails disclosed via a  public records request filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation show. During the protests, the notification read, individuals were injured and property was damaged and police were trying to find out who was responsible.\n  It was not immediately clear how many users received that notification, where exactly the LAPD was seeking video recordings, and how much material the agency ultimately obtained. By requesting video recordings directly from users, the LAPD avoided the multi-step process of securing a warrant or a subpoena to obtain footage from the vast network of personally owned cameras.\n  The LAPD said it keeps no record of when and how often officers make requests of Ring users.\n After The Times reached out to Ring for comment on this story, the company  announced that it changed its policies and now requires police to make requests for video from users in a public forum. \u201cThis way, anyone interested in knowing more about how their police agency is using Request for Assistance posts can simply visit the agency\u2019s profile and see the post history,\u201d the blog post read.\n In response to The Times\u2019 public records request, the LAPD said that it would be \u201cunduly burdensome\u201d to try to determine how often its officers requested or received video from Ring cameras.\n Consumers have embraced doorbell cameras as a useful tool for both home security and convenience. But Heidi Boghosian, a lawyer and former executive director of the National Lawyers Guild, warns of the dangers posed by this private surveillance apparatus, including a potential chilling effect on constitutionally protected freedoms.\n   Experts and activists have for years expressed concerns about the disproportionate effects of surveillance technology on people of color, and further reductions in transparency, she said, could lead to dragnet-style approaches and mass privacy violations.\n \u201cWhen you have the escalation of people\u2019s fears of property or violent crime, it changes the way they interpret ordinary actions of someone walking down the street or ringing their doorbell,\u201d she said, \u201cAnd that can [lead to] communities of color [being] falsely accused of crimes.\u201d\n The lack of transparency is further cause for concern, Electronic Frontier Foundation policy analyst Matthew Guariglia said, because Ring and police departments could be using fear to sell more devices and expand their surveillance powers. In a  letter sent to the California attorney general last week, the Electronic Frontier Foundation asked the state Department of Justice to investigate Ring\u2019s relationship with the 145 police departments across California with which it has partnered.\n  \u201cThese partnerships and these relationships blur the boundaries so that people no longer know if they have a real reason to be afraid in their neighborhood or if the police who come to their door and recommend they adopt the Ring or subsidize the cost of Ring just benefit from that relationship,\u201d Guariglia said.\n  11:45 AM, Jun. 17, 2021: This story was updated to note that Ring said it stopped providing law enforcement clients with an interactive map of Ring devices in 2019.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 09:13:52", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u514d\u8d39,\u8b66\u5bdf,gave,\u6212\u6307", "title": "\u6212\u6307\u66fe\u7ecf\u4e3a100\u6d1b\u6749\u77f6\u8b66\u5bdf\u63d0\u4f9b\u514d\u8d39\u6444\u50cf\u5934 ", "title_en": "Ring Once Gave Free Cameras to 100 Los Angeles Police Officers", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-06-17/ring-influencer-marketing-los-angeles-police-department", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u514d\u8d39", "\u8b66\u5bdf", "gave", "\u6212\u6307"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067609, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5982\u679c\u4f60\uff06\uff0339;\u6211\u4eec\u60f3\u5b66\u4e60c\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u4f60\uff06\uff0339; vere\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\u5982\u4f55\u5efa\u7acb\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4f60\u7684\u4e66\u3002  \u5728\u53ea\u662f\u51e0\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u6211\uff06\uff0339; ll\u6559\u4f60\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528c\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\uff06\uff0339; ll\u5f00\u59cb\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u3002  \u6cbf\u7740\u6211\u4eec\uff06\uff0339; ll\u4e86\u89e3Lisps\u7684\u5947\u602a\u548c\u7f8e\u5999\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u7b80\u660e\u627c\u8981\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5199\u51fa\u7f8e\u597d\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff01  \u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u662f\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u9605\u8bfb\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u9a6c\u4e0a\u5f00\u59cb\uff01 \u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u90a3\u4e9b\u60f3\u8981\u5c55\u793a\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u652f\u6301\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u60f3\u8981\u6700\u597d\u7684\u9605\u8bfb\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ee5\u5370\u5237\u683c\u5f0f\u8d2d\u4e70\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u4e66\u683c\u5f0f\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4fbf\u5b9c\u3002 ", "note_en": "If you&#39;re looking to learn C, or you&#39;ve ever wondered how to build your own programming language, this is the book for you.\n In just a few lines of code, I&#39;ll teach you how to use C, and together, we&#39;ll start building your very own language.\n Along the way we&#39;ll learn about the weird and wonderful nature of Lisps, how to develop a real-world project, concisely solve problems, and write beautiful code!\n This book is free to read online, so you can get started right away!
