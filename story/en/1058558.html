Audiences exhausted by lockdowns and unrelenting 2020-ness were primed for escape into the undersea fantasia of South Africa’s kelp forests, where Foster met her. Best-selling books like  The Soul of an Octopus and  Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness had whetted public curiosity about these uncannily intelligent creatures with whom humans last shared a common ancestor 600 million years ago.</p><p> 发布于2020年9月，它到了完美的时刻。被锁定和不羁疲惫的观众2020-ness被突然进入南非海带森林的海底幻想，福斯特遇见了她。最畅销的书籍像章鱼和其他思想的灵魂：章鱼，大海和意识的深度起源都有关于这些不盛开的聪明生物的威力，人类持续600万年前共同分担共同的祖先。</p><p> Yet while most writing about octopuses emphasizes their ostensibly alien, unknowable nature, 1 and serious, science-minded nature documentaries elevate concern about biodiversity over sentiment for a single animal,  My Octopus Teacher defied convention. It embraced Foster’s feelings for the octopus, which over the course of a year evolved from curiosity to care—even to love. And though her own feelings were left for viewers to interpret, the film’s indelible impression was of nature populated by species who are not only beautiful and exquisitely evolved and ecologically important, but highly sentient, too.</p><p> 然而，虽然大多数关于章鱼的写作强调他们的外星人，不可知的自然，1和严肃的，科学的自然纪录片令我对单身动物的情绪的关注，我的章鱼教师藐视公约。它拥抱了福斯特对八达通的感受，这在一年中的历程中的发展源于奇妙，以照顾 - 甚至要爱。虽然她自己的感情被遗留为观众来解释，但电影的不可磨灭的印象是由物种填充的自然，不仅是美丽和精致的演变和生态重要的，而且是高度感知的。</p><p> Nautilus talked to Foster about his octopus teacher and how getting to know her changed the way he thinks about nature.</p><p> Nautilus谈到了他的章鱼老师，以及如何了解她改变了他对自然的看法。</p><p>  I write a lot about nature and biology and ecology, but in the last few years I’ve focused on the minds of animals and how we think about them. Part of what sent me on that path was an article I wrote a decade ago 2 about researchers trying to understand how octopuses control all eight of their legs simultaneously.</p><p>  我写了很多关于自然和生物学和生态学，但在过去的几年里，我专注于动物的心灵以及我们如何考虑它们。在那条路上发给我的一部分是一条我写了十年前的文章2关于研究人员试图了解偶数同时控制所有八条腿。</p><p> They would put electrodes into an octopus’s brain, run an electric current, and see how they moved. Eventually they could reverse-engineer a map that correlated brain activity and arm coordination. The researcher was a nice, thoughtful person, but there really seemed to be a lack of empathy toward the octopuses themselves.</p><p> 他们会把电极放入章鱼的大脑中，运行电流，看看它们是如何移动的。最终他们可以反向工程师将大脑活动和手臂协调相关的地图。研究人员是一个很好的周到的人，但似乎似乎缺乏对章鱼的同情心。 </p><p> It was an example of what I think is a widespread habit in how we look at wild animals: almost in terms of tech specs, looking at the surface and not thinking about the minds and inner lives and relationships that other nonhumans have. And so for me—and a great many people—that’s what was so wonderful about My Octopus Teacher. It was about the relationship as well as the natural history.</p><p>这是我认为在我们看野生动物的普遍习惯的习惯是一个例子：几乎在科技规范方面，看着表面而不是思考其他非公路的思想和内在的生活和关系。所以对我来说 - 以及许多人 - 这就是我章鱼老师的美妙。这是关于这种关系以及自然历史。</p><p> My first sense from this story is of disconnection from the personal lives of wild animals. It’s what I call a cooling of the heart toward wild nature. The scientist you interacted with was probably a very nice person—but just didn’t seem to think that the animals they experimented on were very sentient and probably in enormous distress. That cooling of the heart, that disconnection from the wild, I think is in some ways the most dangerous thing on the planet at the moment. If you have that feeling and that disconnection, you can do anything and feel okay. And I think that’s why we’re in a very precarious position as a species.</p><p> 我从这个故事中的第一个感觉与野生动物的个人生活脱节了。这就是我称之为狂野的冷却心脏。你与之互动的科学家可能是一个非常好的人 - 但似乎并没有认为他们尝试的动物是非常感知的，可能是巨大的痛苦。这种心脏的冷却，从野外断开，我认为在某种程度上是这个星球上最危险的东西。如果您有这种感觉和断开连接，您可以做任何事情并感觉好。而且我认为这就是我们作为物种非常岌岌可危的地位。</p><p>   Octopuses don’t have tentacles as such. 3 Only squid and cuttlefish have tentacles, and those are the two attack tentacles. Octopuses only have arms.</p><p>   章鱼没有触手。 3只有鱿鱼和墨鱼有触手，那些是两个攻击触手。章鱼只有武器。</p><p> There’s a sort of a slime that’s on the arms, but they clean their suckers meticulously so that they can have powerful suctions. It feels like little suction cups sucking onto your skin and it can be very, very, strong—but if an animal is just curious and knows one, then they’re obviously not applying full force. It’s more of a touch. It’s hard to explain exactly what it feels like. I guess it’s like many little suction cups pulling your skin up at the same time. And of course they can also taste with their suckers, so they’re both feeling you and tasting you and smelling you.</p><p> 在怀里上有一种粘液，但他们精心清洁吸盘，以便他们可以拥有强大的吸取液。感觉就像吮吸着你的皮肤的少量吸盘，它可能是非常非常强烈的 - 但如果动物只是好奇并且知道一个，那么它们显然不会施加全力。这更像是一种触感。很难准确地解释它的感觉。我想这就像许多小吸杯同时拉起你的皮肤。当然，它们也可以用吸盘味道，所以他们都感受到你，品尝你并闻到你。</p><p> That’s delightful, and thank you for correcting me about the tentacles. I’m sorry to make that mistake. I don’t like to talk about somebody’s friend like that.</p><p> 这是令人愉快的，谢谢你纠正我的触手。我很遗憾地犯错误。我不喜欢谈论那样的朋友。</p><p> You don’t have to worry. People like David Attenborough have made that mistake. Many people make that mistake. It’s a pity because it’s such a lovely word, tentacles. It’s a much nicer word than arm.</p><p> 你不必担心。像David Attenborough这样的人已经犯了错误。很多人都犯了这个错误。这是遗憾的，因为这是一个如此可爱的词，触手。这是一个比手臂更好的词。</p><p> In the film your friend became  her and had the pronoun that identified her as an individual—but the shark who ultimately bit off one of her arms remained an  it. Why was that?</p><p> 在电影中，你的朋友成了她，并有代词认为她是个人 - 但是最终偏离她的一个手臂的鲨鱼仍然是它。那为什么？ </p><p> Mostly because I didn’t know that particular shark intimately. So in that very dramatic moment I wasn’t thinking to look underneath and see if it had claspers, to see if it’s male or not. 4 That  it was not a conscious thing as such. You’re probably right, though, it should have been the same.</p><p>主要是因为我不知道特别鲨鱼。所以在那个非常戏剧性的时刻，我没有想看看下面，看看它是否有克拉斯人，看看它是否是男性的。 4这不是一个有意识的事情。但是，你可能是对的，但它应该是一样的。</p><p> Those sharks are very dear to me. I’m very close with them as a species; I’ve watched them very closely for a long time. I know one or two intimately. They’re a vital component of the whole ecosystem, and they’re a vital component for the health of octopus. Especially now because many of the big reef fish have been decimated and those fish would be important predators of octopus. Now those pyjama sharks have taken their place to a certain degree and help with keeping that balance.</p><p> 那些鲨鱼对我来说非常珍贵。我和他们一样靠近他们的物种;我很长一段时间都很紧密地看着它们。我完全了解一两个。它们是整个生态系统的重要组成部分，它们是章鱼健康的重要组成部分。特别是现在，因为许多大礁鱼已经被摧毁，那些鱼将是章鱼的重要掠夺者。现在，那些睡衣鲨已经在一定程度上取得了一定程度，并帮助保持这种平衡。</p><p> There was never any intention to diminish them. They’re certainly not the bad guys or anything like that. Their lives are very fragile—quite a lot more fragile than the octopus, actually, because they mature very late and only lay two eggs.</p><p> 从来没有意图削弱他们。他们肯定不是坏人或那样的东西。他们的生活非常脆弱 - 比章鱼更脆弱，实际上，因为它们成熟很晚，只有两个鸡蛋。</p><p>  How do you make peace between caring so much for one animal and also caring about the creatures who are trying to eat her? This is a tension I wrestle with myself, and I think many people do who really care for the wild animals around them. I have groundhogs who live under my deck, and I love those groundhogs—but I also love the foxes who want to catch them. I kind of feel torn between that sometimes.</p><p>  你如何为一只动物照顾很多，也关心正在尝试吃她的生物？这是一个我与自己搏斗的紧张局势，我认为很多人都在谁真正关心周围的野生动物。我居住在我的甲板下的土拨鼠，我喜欢那些古老的丘陵 - 但我也喜欢想要抓住他们的狐狸。有时候，我有点撕裂。</p><p> The frustrating thing about a film is that you’ve only got 85 minutes. What you don’t see is that I have watched those pyjama sharks for years. I’ve watched them lay eggs in the kelp forest, I’ve watched the eggs slowly mature and those tiny little sharks maturing inside. I’ve watched them, a few of them, actually hatching out of the egg. I’ve watched most of them being predated and killed by whelks and by sea stars, and I see how incredibly fragile they are. I see them sleeping in their caves. I’m incredibly close to that species of shark.</p><p> 关于电影的令人沮丧的事情是你只有85分钟。你看不到的是，我看过那些睡衣鲨鱼多年。我看着他们在海带森林中喝鸡蛋，我已经看着鸡蛋慢慢成熟，那些微小的小鲨鱼里面成熟。我看过他们，其中一些，实际上孵化出来。我看过大多数人被鲸鱼和海星杀死，我看到他们有多脆弱。我看到他们在洞穴里睡觉。我非常接近那种鲨鱼。</p><p>  I know all their little intricacies. There’s no time, unfortunately, to show all that. I’m close to many, many different species. What you see in the film is how I’ve been very close to the octopus, my teacher, and she was so special—but what you don’t see is that I’m close to many different animals. All the different types of fish I got to know extremely well, otters, even some of the mollusks. Whales. There’re so many different animals. There’s no time to show all of that.</p><p>  我知道他们所有的缺乏复杂性。不幸的是，没有时间来展示这一切。我接近许多不同的物种。你在电影中所看到的是我是如何非常接近章鱼，我的老师，她是如此特别 - 但你看不到的是我接近许多不同的动物。所有不同类型的鱼，我都要了解非常好，甚至是一些软体动物。鲸鱼。有很多不同的动物。没有时间展示所有这一切。</p><p> So it’s very easy to not have favorites because I know how incredibly hard the life of a pyjama shark is and how incredibly difficult it is to get to adulthood. And it’s sometimes horrific to see fishermen catching these animals and just throwing them on shore and letting them die because they don’t want to take a break. There’s no way I can have favorites while being close to all these animals and knowing all their lives. And who am I as a human with my limited understanding to interfere in a system that has, in a way, been built by this giant biological intelligence over millennia.</p><p> 所以这很容易没有收藏，因为我知道睡衣鲨的生活有多难以令人难以置信，而且它是多么难以到达成年期。看到渔民捕捉这些动物并刚刚把它们扔到岸边并让他们死亡，因为他们不想休息一下，这有时可怕。我无法接近所有这些动物，并知道他们所有的生活。谁是我作为一种人类，我的理解有限地干扰一个在某种程度上是由这一巨大的生物智力建立在千年之上。 </p><p> You might actually have just answered another question of mine. In the film, when you describe your choice not to intervene in the pyjama sharks’ pursuit of your octopus teacher, you say there’s a line that can’t be crossed. Where is that line between helping and not helping? Why should one not cross it?</p><p>您实际上可能只是回答了我的另一个问题。在电影中，当你描述你的选择时不要介入睡衣鲨的追求你的章鱼老师，你说有一条无法交叉的线。在帮助而不帮助之间的那条线在哪里？为什么人们应该不穿过它？</p><p> I guess the simple answer is that if you’re going to intervene between predator and prey, like your groundhogs and foxes, you’re asking for trouble. But if it’s a single animal that’s in great distress, and you can do something just to help that animal a little bit—they have lives that are so tough anyway, and we’ve made their lives so tough. So if one of your foxes had a damaged leg or was really struggling you could just help that animal a little bit to get past that. If it didn’t interfere with the rest of the group or with other animals, that might be viable. That, for me, is the line.</p><p> 我猜简单的答案是，如果你要介入掠夺者和猎物之间，就像你的土拨鼠和狐狸一样，你就要求麻烦。但如果它是一个非常痛苦的动物，你可以做点什么，只是为了帮助那种动物有点 - 他们有着生活，无论如何，我们让他们的生活如此艰难。所以如果你的一个狐狸有一个受损的腿或者真的挣扎，你就可以帮助这种动物有点越来越过去。如果它没有干扰组的其余部分或与其他动物，那可能是可行的。这对我来说，是线。</p><p> We desperately need nature to regenerate itself. We need to leave big parts of the wild alone and let them regenerate. It’s actually critical. And if there are individual animals that we can help—we have created a world that is very difficult for them to operate in, but if we actually intervene in the natural process of survival between species, that doesn’t help the natural system.</p><p> 我们迫切需要自然来重新生成自己。我们需要单独留下狂野的大部分，让它们再生。它实际上是至关重要的。如果有各种动物我们可以帮助 - 我们创造了一个非常困难的世界，他们运作很难，但如果我们实际干预物种之间生存的自然过程中，那就没有帮助自然系统。</p><p> When I first adopted Lucas nine years ago from a cat rescue organization in Washington, D.C., his name was Puck. “Because he’s mischievous,” his foster mother said.

Over the years I have actually treated those foxes a couple times for mange, and I do appreciate that perhaps in some way I’m interfering with the natural process of disease and their population density on the landscape. On the other hand, mange is just such a terrible way to die. I can’t just stand by when I could do something.</p><p> 我喜欢你的方式。这是我自己想象的。多年来，我实际上已经对待那些狐狸的船长，我确实在某种程度上感到欣赏，我会干扰疾病的自然过程及其人口密度在景观中。另一方面，Mange只是死亡的一种可怕的方式。当我能做点什么时，我不能站起来。</p><p> I totally agree. The only thing to add to that, where you have to be slightly careful, is if an animal hasn’t got strong genes. And then you interfere and you allow that animal to procreate. You could potentially be making the gene pool weaker and more susceptible to mange. That’s where you have to be a bit careful.</p><p> 我完全同意。唯一要补充的是，你必须略微小心的地方，是一种动物是否没有强烈的基因。然后你干扰，你允许那只动物进入生育。您可能会使基因库变得较弱，更容易受到Mange。那就是你必须要小心的地方。</p><p> Absolutely, and it’s the kind of thing we take responsibility for when we intrude like that. I think it really makes it incumbent on us to act as knowledgeably as we can.</p><p> 绝对，当我们侵入那种时，我们对责任的那种东西。我认为它真的使我们能够尽可能地行事。 </p><p>   You mentioned how awful it is to see pyjama sharks caught and thrown onto shore. I could hear the pain in your voice as you said that.</p><p>你提到了看睡衣鲨被抓住并扔到岸边有多可怕。当你说的话，我可以听到你声音的痛苦。</p><p> Many of the people I know in the animal advocacy world struggle with how to process all the pain that they’re aware of. In some ways, not really thinking about the personal lives of animals buffers us from that. It protects one from the psychic difficulty of seeing the suffering of other animals. How do you cope? How do you make peace with that suffering—the suffering that we cause, and also the suffering that is going to exist independently of us?</p><p> 我在动物倡导世界中我所知的许多人都与如何处理他们所清楚的所有痛苦斗争。在某些方面，并没有真正考虑动物的个人生活，从中保护我们。它保护一个人从看到其他动物的痛苦中免受心理学困难。你如何应对？你如何与痛苦 - 我们引起的痛苦以及将与我们独立存在的痛苦？</p><p>  I work with a lot of young people who are very dedicated to conservation and to nature, and see how it difficult it is for them to deal with climate change and the environmental crisis that is unfolding. The more you know, the more painful and scary it becomes.</p><p>  我与很多致力于保护和自然的年轻人合作​​，看看他们如何应对气候变化以及展开的环境危机是如何难以实现的。你所知道的越多，它变得越来越痛苦和可怕。</p><p>  What does help me in a way is that one of my big interests is human origins. I’m interested in Middle Stone Age life—100,000 years ago, 50,000 years ago. One can see these enormous changes over time. Even in my lifetime, I’ve seen many species fluctuating radically in their numbers. It does give me hope that the wild system has immense capacity to recover. It gives me hope that if we can wake up from this sleep, this disconnection from wildlife, then they can recover.</p><p>  什么是帮助我的方式是，我的一个大兴趣是人类起源。我对中石头时代生活 -  100,000年前，50,000年前。人们可以看到这些巨大的变化随着时间的推移。即使在我的一生中，我也看到许多物种在他们的数字中剧烈波动。它确实让我希望野外系统具有巨大的康复能力。它让我希望如果我们可以从这个睡眠中醒来，这种野生动物断开，然后他们可以恢复。</p><p> The personal suffering that one becomes aware of is difficult to deal with because, I think, these animals are way more sentient and feel way more emotion than we ever imagined, so it’s not easy to deal with that. I don’t have an easy answer. Do you have an answer for that?</p><p> 个人遭受意识到的人难以应对，因为，我认为，这些动物是更有令人感情的方式，感觉比我们想象更多的情感，所以这并不容易处理这一点。我没有一个简单的答案。你有答案吗？</p><p> I certainly don’t have a simple answer, or even a complete answer, and maybe this is a bit of a cop-out—but the way I think about it is that human life has a great deal of suffering, too. There’s no way around it. But that doesn’t make our own lives any less special. That doesn’t take away from all of the good.</p><p> 我当然没有一个简单的答案，甚至是一个完整的答案，也许这是一点警察 - 但我认为的方式是人类生活也有很大的痛苦。它没有办法。但这并不是让自己的生命不那么特别。那不带走所有的好处。</p><p> With the lives of animals, I think sometimes we have a tendency to emphasize one or the other. We want to see all the good parts and act like the bad isn’t there—or we see only the bad stuff, and don’t think about the good. And I think that comes from a well-intentioned place, a place of compassion. In the end I think the good outweighs the bad. Or at least the opportunity for good outweighs the bad.</p><p> 随着动物的生命，我想有时我们有一个倾向于强调一个或另一个。我们希望看到所有好的部分，并表现得像坏的那样 - 或者我们只看到坏东西，并不考虑好的。我认为这来自一个善意的地方，一个慈悲的地方。最后，我认为这胜过了糟糕的困难。或者至少有机会越来越糟糕。 </p><p> In spring I like to watch herring as they return from the ocean. And then, a few months later, I’ll go swimming and these vast schools of fish who hatched from their eggs will pass by. It’s such a glorious thing. But of course 99 in 100 of them will be eaten soon, or die from disease, or not get enough to eat. I once asked someone—I think it was the philosopher Sue Ruddick—how to make peace with that and she said not to focus on the fact that they’ll die, but on how they have a chance to thrive.</p><p>在春天，我喜欢在从海洋回归时观看鲱鱼。然后，几个月后，我会去游泳，这些来自鸡蛋孵化的这些鱼类将通过。这是一个如此辉煌的东西。但是当然，在其中100个中，他们就会很快食用，或者死于疾病，或者没有足够吃。我曾经问过某人 - 我认为这是哲学家苏鲁德奇 - 如何与之建立和平，她说不要专注于他们会死的事实，而是他们有机会茁壮成长。</p><p> Maybe that’s just a way of trying to make myself feel better, but I think there’s something to it.</p><p> 也许这只是一种试图让自己感觉更好的一种方式，但我认为有一些东西。</p><p> It’s a good way of looking at life. I think that one of the real sufferings we have as a species is that we have in many ways severed the thread to the wild. The thread that’s been with us for 6,000 generations. And that is, consciously or unconsciously, extremely traumatic and difficult for us as a species. We cause immense suffering for ourselves by disconnecting from the wild.</p><p> 这是看生活的好方法。我认为我们作为一种物种的真正痛苦之一是，我们有许多方式将线程切断到野外。与我们一起使用的线程为6,000代。这是有意识地或无意识地，对我们作为物种的极其创伤性和困难。通过断开与野外的连接，我们造成巨大的痛苦。</p><p>  This morning I was out as usual and there was just an incredible sight in the very shallow water. This beautiful, fully wild octopus was moving around, hunting in the shallows. And it was just absolutely wild, absolutely free. They only live for a year, a year and a half—so that animal hasn’t got many existential problems. It is just thriving in its wildness.</p><p>  今天早上，我像往常一样出去，在浅水中只是一个令人难以置信的景象。这美丽，完全狂野的八达通在浅滩上狩猎。它只是绝对狂野，绝对免费。他们只住了一年，一年半 - 以便动物没有很多存在的问题。它只是在野性中蓬勃发展。</p><p> In that space it’s extremely present. So for some animals it is good—but for many, unfortunately, like the African penguins here, the problem is the food source. We are diminishing their food source. For many of them it’s a slow starvation, which is really tough to deal with.</p><p> 在那个空间里，它非常出现。所以对于一些动物来说，它是好的 - 但对于许多人来说，不幸的是，就像非洲企鹅这里一样，问题是食物来源。我们正在削弱他们的食物来源。对于其中的许多人来说，这是一个缓慢的饥饿，这真的很难处理。</p><p> So as one comes to think of oneself as being surrounded by sentience, how does that change one’s relations to the wild world? What comes out of that—for yourself, and for us?</p><p> 因此，一个人认为自己被感知所包围，这是如何改变一个人与狂野世界的关系？是什么 - 为自己而对我们来说？</p><p> I think that it’s many things. You realize this tremendous intelligence and the sophistication of these animals’ lives. The things they do to survive and procreate are so fantastical and magnificent that it develops a sense of awe that you’re surrounded by these real stories of wild animals that are far more radical than our wildest science fiction. That gives one a sense of absolute awe for the nature. It certainly makes me want to know more and be more curious and step deeper into their secret lives.</p><p> 我认为这是很多事情。你意识到这种巨大的智慧和这些动物的生命的复杂性。他们以生存和生育的事情是如此奇妙和壮观，即它造成了一种令人敬畏的感觉，即你被这些真正的野生动物的真正故事所包围的恐惧比我们最疯狂的科幻小说更为激进。这给出了对自然的绝对敬畏感。当然让我想了解更多，更加好奇，更深入地进入他们的秘密生活。 </p><p> It fills one with such a joy to see this sentience unfolding. Especially if one has had the privilege of being able to immerse and it’s been revealed in a profound way. And then the next thing that happens is you realize that their lives and our lives are not separate. They are completely interlinked. The health of their lives and the health of biodiversity directly affects our health and our wellbeing. Even for people who don’t have any contact with them, or any sense that they exist.</p><p>它充满了这样一种快乐，看看这种感觉展开。特别是如果一个人有权沉浸并且它被深刻地揭示了。然后，你意识到他们的生活和我们的生活并不分开。它们完全相互联系。生命的健康和生物多样性的健康直接影响了我们的健康和我们的健康。即使对于与他们没有任何接触的人，或者任何感觉都存在。</p><p> This is a simple example that I’m sure you know: The ocean produces at least half of the oxygen we breathe. But everything we take in, everything we drink, everything we breathe, everything we eat, is completely reliant on biodiversity being in place in wild ecosystems. And that’s what we seem to have forgotten: that the great Mother Nature is literally keeping us alive from second to second.</p><p> 这是一个简单的例子，我相信你知道：海洋生产至少一半的氧气我们呼吸。但我们所采取的一切，我们喝的一切，我们呼吸的一切，我们吃的一切都完全依赖于野生生态系统中的生物多样性。这就是我们似乎忘记的：伟大的母亲大自然实际上是让我们活着从第二到第二个。</p><p> You realize that we are totally interwoven with this giant biological intelligence. If we wish to continue living and if we wish to continue living healthily, we should be doing everything in our power to sustain and regenerate that biodiversity.</p><p> 你意识到我们与这种巨大的生物智力完全交织在一起。如果我们希望继续生活，如果我们希望健康地继续生活，我们应该在我们的权力下努力维持和重新制定这种生物多样性。</p><p>  At the end of  My Octopus Teacher, when you describe how the relationship changed your thinking, you said, “What she taught me was to feel that you’re part of this place, not a visitor, and that’s a huge difference.” Why didn’t you feel that way before? As someone who makes nature documentaries you have certainly been immersed in the wild world all your life.</p><p>  在我章鱼老师的尽头，当你描述关系改变你的思想时，你说：“她教导了我，觉得你是这个地方的一部分，而不是游客，这是一个巨大的差异。”为什么你之前没有觉得这样？作为让您居住在狂野世界的人中所有生命中的人。</p><p> For me that sense of not feeling like a visitor only came when I could understand the wild language properly. That comes from the tracking and that comes from years of going in every day, sometimes twice a day. That’s what I’m doing now. There’s a big shift that happened with me. Suddenly I could speak the wild language, I could see the motivations, I could see into the secret lives of these animals. Suddenly I felt I could speak the same language, albeit not very fluently. That made a massive difference.</p><p> 对我来说，当我能够正确理解狂野语言时，感觉不像游客一样。这是来自追踪，而且来自每天的多年来，有时每天两次。这就是我现在在做的事情。我发生了很大的班次。突然间我可以说野生语言，我可以看到动机，我可以看到这些动物的秘密生活。突然间，我觉得我可以说同一种语言，尽管不是很流利的语言。这取得了巨大的差异。</p><p> Before, I had spent a lot of time in nature, a lot of time filming, a lot of time knowing the animals—but more on a surface level, not actually being able to track them very well, or understand this wild language I’m talking about. I was never much good at it. I could film animals very well, but it’s a very different thing to immerse yourself in the wild, spending every day dedicated for months and years.</p><p> 之前，我花了很多时间，很多时间拍摄，很多时候都知道动物 - 但更多的表面级别，实际上没有能够追踪它们，或者理解这种野生语言我'谈论。我永远不会擅长它。我可以很好地拍摄动物，但这是沉浸在野外，每天都在花费几个月和几年的情况下沉浸在野外是一件非常不同的事情。</p><p> I needed to break through that surface layer and really sense what these animals were about. And I could predict what they would do, I could see the tracks and know what they did in the night. I could see trends of population explosions and animal populations diminishing. I really felt part of the system and I felt I understood the system to some degree. Do you understand what I’m saying?</p><p> 我需要突破该表面层，真的是这些动物所在的那种。我可以预测他们会做什么，我可以看到曲目，并知道他们在夜晚所做的事情。我可以看到人口爆炸和动物人口递减的趋势。我真的感受到了系统的一部分，我觉得我理解了这些系统到某种程度上。你明白我所说的吗？ </p><p>   I would say so. Not quite as immersive as what you had, but it made a great difference to me. A few years ago I lived in a suburb of Washington D.C. It was kind of a transition zone between city and country, and there was much more wild life than I had expected. Down the street from me was a stormwater retention pond and there was a little pocket forest beside it. For the two years that I lived there I would just go there every day, often twice a day, and just sit.</p><p>我会这么说。不要像你所拥有的那样沉浸，但它对我带来了很大巨大的差异。几年前，我住在华盛顿州的郊区。它是城市和国家之间的过渡带，而且比我所期望的更多野生寿命。沿着我的街道是一个暴风雨保留池，旁边有一个小口袋森林。这两年我在那里居住，我会每天都去那里，往往每天两次，只是坐下。</p><p> As I got to know those animals—not always as individuals, but at least as very distinct communities, and sometimes as individuals—it opened up such a different window onto their world. Before that I certainly appreciated them, and I would be happy to see a mockingbird or a sparrow, but I didn’t fully appreciate that it was a very particular sparrow with social relations and for whom this stormwater pond was part of their neighborhood just as it was for me. And I could see the relations playing out around me; I knew their morning rituals, where they would go for food, how they interacted and responded.</p><p> 正如我必须知道那些动物 - 并不总是作为个人，但至少作为非常独特的社区，有时候是个人 - 它在他们的世界里打开了这样一个不同的窗户。在此之前，我当然很欣赏他们，我很乐意看到一只模仿鸟或麻雀，但我并没有完全理解这是一个非常特别的麻雀，具有社会关系，这是雨水池塘是他们邻居的一部分这是对我的。我可以看到与我周围的关系;我知道他们的早晨仪式，他们会去寻找食物，他们如何互动和回应。</p><p>  So that type of awareness that you’re describing—is that something that people can get if they just live in a city or in the suburbs, if the animals they have are squirrels and sparrows and common creatures?</p><p>  那么你描述的意识的类型 - 是人们可以在一个城市或郊区住在城市或郊区的东西，如果他们有松鼠和麻雀和普通生物？</p><p> Absolutely. It’s easier, in a way, to do that. The trick is having regular, daily access to the animals’ lives. So birds are perfect to work with. Insects are perfect to work with. In fact a friend of mine, Jon Young, put out a wonderful book called  What the Robin Knows, about understanding how bird language works. I would rather be studying a tiny bird every day than going on an enormous wildlife adventure to deepest Africa every few months. You’ll get more out of that daily interaction with the bird or insect in your backyard than the sporadic, very dramatic adventures.</p><p> 绝对地。在某种程度上，它更容易做到这一点。诀窍是经常，日常进入动物的生命。所以鸟是完美的。昆虫是完美的。事实上，我的一个朋友，Jon Young，推出了一本闻名的书，称罗宾知道什么，了解鸟类工程如何。我宁愿每天都在学习一只小鸟，而不是每隔几个月到最深入的非洲野生动物冒险。您将在与您的后院中的鸟类或昆虫的日常互动比零星，非常戏剧性的冒险。</p><p>  There was an online conversation sparked by the feminist scholar Sophie Lewis, who critiqued  My Octopus Teacher through a lens of queer theory. I found the critique to be really problematic on several levels, including how she spoke so glibly about a relationship that mattered so much to you. We would not treat someone’s relationship with a fellow human like that.</p><p>  女性主义学者索菲刘易斯引发了在线谈话，他通过奇怪的理论镜头批评我的章鱼老师。我发现批评在几个层面上真正有问题，包括她如何简洁地对待你的关系。我们不会与像那样的人的关系对待某人的关系。</p><p> So that bothered me, but she did ask an interesting question: many times you and your octopus teacher touched one another, but as she wa</p><p> 所以困扰着我，但她确实问了一个有趣的问题：很多时候，你和你的章鱼老师互相碰到了，但随着她的方式</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://nautil.us/issue/99/universality/how-my-octopus-teacher-defied-convention">https://nautil.us/issue/99/universality/how-my-octopus-teacher-defied-convention</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/老师/">#老师</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/teacher/">#teacher</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/动物/">#动物</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
