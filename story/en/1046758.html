Its first innovation is also its most famous one – the flatpack furniture. By introducing this concept, and moving furniture assembly onto the user – contrary to what other furniture stores were doing – it allowed the company to reduce costs. This concept made IKEA the world’s biggest furniture store, with no real worldwide competition. This enviable position, allowed it to focus on other innovations and products that could improve the IKEA brand and allow the company to enter new markets.</p><p>自1943年成立以来，宜家（IKEA）这个名字一直是最小，便宜的家具的代名词，这些家具可以在自己的家中购买和组装。它的第一个创新也是它最著名的一个-Flatpack家具。通过引入这个概念，并将家具组装转移到用户身上，这与其他家具店的做法相反，这使该公司降低了成本。这一理念使宜家成为全球最大的家具店，没有真正的全球竞争。这一令人羡慕的地位使它能够专注于其他可改善宜家品牌并允许公司进入新市场的创新和产品。</p><p> There were, of course, a number of high profile  mistakes, but how else would a company from Sweden make €12.4 billion profit, if not for continuously making mistakes and learning from them along the way? The IKEA furniture made in the 1950s might not be fitting for today or appropriate in 10 years, while the food sold by the company 20 years ago might not respect the increasing sustainable lifestyle of many of its customers. The creation of  SPACE10, IKEA’s very own  ‘X’, the former Google X, has helped the company to experiment with new concepts and projects to address these challenges and keep the company on the forefront to new challenges. IKEA is changing how customers live, eat, and work, and its future will have a bigger role in our everyday lives.</p><p> 当然，这里有很多引人注目的错误，但是如果不是不断地犯错误并从中汲取教训，瑞典的一家公司又将如何赚取124亿欧元的利润呢？ 1950年代制造的宜家家具可能不适用于今天或十年后仍不适用，而该公司20年前出售的食品可能不尊重其许多客户日益增长的可持续生活方式。宜家自己的“ X”（以前的Google X）的诞生创造了SPACE10，这使该公司尝试了新的概念和项目来应对这些挑战，并使公司始终走在新挑战的前列。宜家正在改变顾客的生活，饮食和工作方式，其未来将在我们的日常生活中发挥更大的作用。</p><p> There are four main areas where I believe IKEA is spearheading new concepts, new technology, and better practices:</p><p> 我认为宜家在四个主要领域引领新概念，新技术和更好的做法：</p><p>  I’ll delve deeper into each category and explain how IKEA is expected to be innovating in each, and then we’ll briefly look at how IKEA has the potential to rival Amazon, as it makes the jump from a furniture store to the everyday store.</p><p>  我将深入探讨每个类别，并解释宜家将如何在每个类别中进行创新，然后，我们将简要地探讨宜家在与家具亚马逊的竞争中所具有的与亚马逊相匹敌的潜力。 。</p><p>  A few years after the flatpack furniture was invented, IKEA started opening IKEA Bistros and food markets, in its out-of-town stores.</p><p>  发明扁平包装家具几年后，宜家开始在其郊区商店开设宜家小餐馆和食品市场。</p><p> “It’s difficult to do business with someone on an empty stomach.”</p><p> “与空腹的人做生意很难。”</p><p> These were the words of IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad, who wanted to start serving food to the people spending whole days at IKEA stores out of the city. What better way to keep customers at your store than to offer them cheap AND good food?</p><p> 这就是宜家创始人英格瓦·坎普拉德（Ingvar Kamprad）的话，他想开始为全天在宜家城外商店里的人们提供食物。有什么比为顾客提供便宜又好吃的食物更好的方式来留住顾客的呢？ </p><p> The meatball remains an IKEA favourite, and the word itself has become as synonyms to IKEA as the flatpack furniture. With millions of IKEA meatballs sold each year, you would think the company would not want to upset the cart by changing recipes and adding new items to the menu. However IKEA did just that, and in mid-2020 it rolled out its ‘ veggie balls’ and the ‘ veggie hotdog’ for public consumption. Two of the most famous IKEA food staples now have their vegetarian version, with the veggie balls producing around 15 to 20 times less carbon footprint than the meatballs. IKEA also joined forces with other organisations to buy sustainably farmed  coffee, and  tea and created the ‘IKEA Food  Better Chicken’ programme which seeks to source chicken under strict animal welfare criteria.</p><p>肉丸仍然是宜家的最爱，这个词本身已成为宜家的同义词，就像扁平包装的家具一样。每年售出数以百万计的宜家肉丸，您可能会认为该公司不想通过更改食谱和在菜单中添加新项目来破坏购物车。然而，宜家只是这样做了，并于2020年中期推出了“素食球”和“素食热狗”以供公众消费。宜家最著名的两种主食现在有其素食版本，这种素食球产生的碳足迹比肉丸少15至20倍。宜家还与其他组织合作，购买可持续种植的咖啡和茶，并制定了“宜家食物更好的鸡肉”计划，力求在严格的动物福利标准下采购鸡肉。</p><p>  Like other companies in the food sector, IKEA recognises the increasing number of individuals becoming aware of the carbon footprint needed to sustain the current consumption pattern. SPACE10 has been trying to build on the meatball’s legacy by creating new concepts which leave a much smaller carbon footprint, like meatballs made from artificial meat and those made from insects, which are not unconventional ideas in 2020, even if they have yet to enter the mainstream markets. The Lab also has a concept of a 3D printed meatball, which is more of an aesthetical project rather than a ready-to-serve meatball, however, this goes to show how SPACE10 is seeking to broaden the perspective of both IKEA itself, as well as its customers, to future possibilities in the food sector.</p><p>  与食品行业的其他公司一样，宜家也认识到越来越多的人意识到维持当前消费模式所需的碳足迹。 SPACE10一直试图通过创建新概念来建立更小的碳足迹，例如，人造肉制成的肉丸和昆虫制成的肉丸，以在肉丸的遗产上建立基础，即使到了2020年，这也不是非常规的想法。主流市场。实验室还具有3D打印肉丸的概念，它更像是一个美学项目，而不是即食肉丸，但是，这表明SPACE10如何寻求扩大宜家本身的视野作为其客户，以发展食品行业的未来可能性。</p><p>  In the early 1990s, IKEA realised that the  increase in residential property prices is making it harder and harder for certain sections of the population looking to buy a home without having to break the bank.  BoKlok was born from an agreement between Swedish construction giants, Skanska, and IKEA, to build and design low-cost housing, complete with, of course, IKEA furnishing. Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland have been the first beneficiaries of this project, while the  United Kingdom will be the first country to host BoKlok housing outside of the Nordics.</p><p>  在1990年代初期，宜家意识到住宅物业价格的上涨使某些想要购买房屋而不必破产的人口变得越来越难。 BoKlok诞生于瑞典建筑巨头Skanska与宜家之间的一项协议，该协议旨在建造和设计低成本住房，当然还包括宜家家具。瑞典，挪威，丹麦和芬兰是该项目的首批受益者，而英国将是第一个在北欧以外提供BoKlok住房的国家。</p><p> BoKlok, which was also called ‘ the flatpack taken to the next level’, prides itself in using as limited and as sustainable resources as possible. The design and materials used for the pre-fabricated blocks make the houses’ energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable. This modular housing technique, allows BoKlok to build up to 80% of the houses in a factory and then transport and assemble them to the construction site itself.</p><p> BoKlok，也被称为“进入下一个阶段的扁平化包装”，以使用尽可能有限和可持续的资源而自豪。预制砌块所使用的设计和材料使房屋具有高能效和环境可持续性。这种模块化的房屋技术使BoKlok可以在工厂中建造多达80％的房屋，然后将其运输并组装到施工现场本身。</p><p>  With BoKlok, IKEA has managed to infiltrate the housing market, and as housing prices continue to rise above median wages, the company will continue to find a market for low-cost housing. What made BoKlok successful, and continues to do so, is the cost-cutting every step of the way, with profits then being passed on to the consumer. A combination of cheap land, a single standard design, and large-volume manufacturing allows IKEA to create entire housing estates while eliminating brokers and their fees. Buying a flat with BoKlok is also as simple as buying a new bed frame from IKEA – you just have to register at the nearest IKEA store for available housing units.</p><p>  宜家通过BoKlok设法渗透到了住房市场，并且随着住房价格继续上涨超过工资中位数，该公司将继续寻找低成本住房的市场。使BoKlok成功并继续取得成功的是削减成本的每一步，然后将利润转移给消费者。廉价土地，单一标准设计和大批量制造相结合，使宜家能够创建整个住宅区，同时消除经纪人及其费用。与BoKlok一起购买公寓就像从宜家购买新床架一样简单-您只需在最近的宜家商店进行注册，即可获得可用的住房单元。</p><p> While this is already disruptive in the current housing market, IKEA, or rather IKEA’s SPACE10 has already come up with a BoKlok on steroids – a new concept for future housing and working environment. ‘ The Urban Village Project’ shares the same aims of BoKlok, that of creating a sustainable and affordable way of living, but it also aims higher – to completely transform the housing market, by “bypassing the interests of short-term investors”. What this means is that the Project looks for financing by collaborating with “pension funds, future-oriented companies and municipalities” in order to drive down costs, and combine the project with co-operative structures to keep housing within the community. All managed through a neat-looking app.</p><p> 尽管这已经在当前的住房市场中造成了破坏，但宜家，或者更确切地说，宜家的SPACE10已经提出了关于类固醇的BoKlok-一种针对未来住房和工作环境的新概念。 “城市乡村项目”与BoKlok有着相同的目标，即创造一种可持续的和负担得起的生活方式，但其更高的目标是通过“超越短期投资者的利益”来完全改变房地产市场。这意味着该项目通过与“养老基金，面向未来的公司和市政当局”合作寻求融资，以降低成本，并将该项目与合作组织结合起来，以在社区内保留住房。所有内容都通过外观精美的应用程序进行管理。</p><p>  Related to this, is IKEA’s  announcement that it will start to create robotic furniture for small spaces. Rolling out in places like Hong Kong and Japan, micro-apartments will be the first to feel the benefits of the Rognan furniture, which transforms easily depending on what you need to use at the time. The idea is that one will not use a certain section of the place while busy doing something else, like not using the bed if you’re on the sofa – and Rognan helps to maximise space accordingly.</p><p>  与此相关的是宜家宣布将开始为小空间打造机器人家具。微型公寓将在香港和日本等地推出，将是第一个从Rognan家具中受益的人，该家具可以根据您当时需要的用途轻松转换。这样的想法是，在忙于做其他事情时，例如在沙发上不使用床时，人们将不会使用该位置的某个区域–而罗格南（Rognan）会相应地最大化空间。 </p><p>  In the near future, I would also see IKEA getting into the workspaces sector, providing low-cost offices for freelancers and even startups looking to cut costs. Coworking is expected to grow to an estimated  $11.52 billion in 2023, with Europe, IKEA’s home territory, leading the way, which makes it easier for the company to integrate this sector into its current BoKlok partnership with Skanska.</p><p>在不久的将来，我还将看到宜家进入工作空间领域，为自由职业者甚至希望削减成本的初创企业提供低成本的办公室。 Coworking预计将在2023年增长到115.2亿美元，其中宜家的总部位于欧洲，欧洲将带头发展，这将使该公司更轻松地将该部门整合到当前与Skanska的BoKlok合作伙伴关系中。</p><p>  In more recent years, IKEA added smart home products in its catalogue. While the company was relatively late to the party, today the IKEA customer has a number of functional smart products to choose from and which can be easily connected through the IKEA Home smart app, as well as other third-party applications. In typical IKEA fashion, its mantra of ‘making not using space’, the company did not just copy other smart appliances – IKEA’s wireless chargers can be integrated into furniture, and a SONOS Bluetooth speaker is produced either as a bookshelf or as a lamp, and both work with Google Assistant, Alexa, and Siri voice assistants. This is certainly an area were IKEA will be looking to improve on. By creating its own smart technology as an integrated part of its furniture, the company would be able to get a better understanding of how its products are being used, for how long, and can even signal to the owner when that furniture needs repairing or replacing.</p><p>  近年来，宜家在其目录中增加了智能家居产品。在公司参加聚会的时间相对较晚的今天，宜家客户可以选择多种功能性智能产品，并且可以通过宜家家居智能应用程序以及其他第三方应用程序轻松连接。该公司以“不使用空间”的口号，以典型的宜家方式，不只是复制其他智能电器-宜家的无线充电器可以集成到家具中，而SONOS蓝牙扬声器既可以制成书架，也可以制成灯具。两者都可以与Google Assistant，Alexa和Siri语音助手一起使用。当然，这是宜家希望改进的领域。通过创建自己的智能技术作为家具的集成部分，该公司将能够更好地了解其产品的使用方式，使用时间，甚至在需要维修或更换家具时向业主发出信号。 。</p><p>  A series of projects called ‘ Everyday Experiments’, by SPACE10, continue on this trend of making sure that the smart appliances being created are beneficial to the consumer. These experiments recognise the increasing multi-dimensional use of one’s house, from living quarters, to play areas, to work stations. The latter is an increasingly important part of one’s home, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Smart improvements to the house have to respect the serenity one looks for in a home, making life easier and more comfortable, while avoiding adding further technological distractions. There are also, of course, privacy issues when it comes to smart furniture or appliances, so IKEA would also be wary of further technological intrusiveness on its customers.</p><p>  SPACE10推出了一系列名为“日常实验”的项目，以确保创建的智能设备对消费者有利的趋势继续发展。这些实验认识到，从居住区到娱乐场所再到工作站，人们越来越多地使用房屋。后者已成为家中越来越重要的部分，尤其是自从COVID-19大流行以来。对房屋进行巧妙的改进必须尊重人们在房屋中寻找的宁静，使生活更轻松，更舒适，同时避免增加更多的技术干扰。当然，在智能家具或家电方面也存在隐私问题，因此宜家也要警惕对其客户的进一步技术干扰。</p><p> Some of these experiments are more likely to be used in everyday situations than others, such as the one using  hand gestures to control a light fitting, making it easier for someone to switch on/off or dim the lights without having to move.</p><p> 这些实验中的一些比其他实验更可能在日常情况下使用，例如使用手势控制灯具的实验，使某人无需移动即可更轻松地打开/关闭或调暗灯光。</p><p>  While IKEA might need to collaborate with other technological companies, such as SONOS, and depend on Google, Amazon, and Apple for voice assistants in order to grow its smart ecosystem in the short term, its better understanding of the home and what tenants want from it, allow IKEA to be in a position to create superior, practical smart appliances, than other companies in the field. Björn Block, Business Leader at IKEA Home Smart, himself  said that:</p><p>  宜家可能需要与SONOS等其他技术公司合作，并依赖Google，Amazon和Apple作为语音助手，以便在短期内发展其智能生态系统，但它需要更好地了解房屋以及租户的需求与宜家的其他公司相比，它使宜家能够创造出卓越，实用的智能家电。宜家家居智能业务负责人BjörnBlock自己说：</p><p> “We’re ( IKEA) definitely into the tech space, we’re into the digital space, and we really want to be here and really play this because I think that we can also make a difference.”</p><p> “我们（IKEA）肯定进入了技术领域，我们进入了数字领域，我们真的想在这里并真正发挥作用，因为我认为我们也可以有所作为。”</p><p>   This area is very much linked to the Smart Home, but it deserves a separate section due to AR’s possible broad applications within one’s home, as well as IKEA’s and SPACE10’s extensive experiments in the field.</p><p>   该区域与智能家居密切相关，但由于AR在其家庭中可能的广泛应用，以及宜家和SPACE10在该领域的广泛实验，因此应将其分开放置。 </p><p> The company has taken advantage of Apple’s ARKit and iOS11 to launch its own  IKEA Place, an iPhone-only app (for now) which lets users interact better with their homes and IKEA products, before even visiting an IKEA store or its online marketplace. ‘IKEA Place’ offers the ability for smartphone users to look through their screens and interact with their real-life space, by placing IKEA products in the living room or bedroom. By being true to scale, it allows you to make an easier decision on which sofa, bed frame, or chair can fit within your space.</p><p>该公司已利用Apple的ARKit和iOS11推出了自己的IKEA Place，这是一个仅限iPhone的应用程序（目前），它使用户甚至可以在访问IKEA商店或其在线市场之前，与自己的房屋和IKEA产品进行更好的交互。通过将IKEA产品放置在客厅或卧室中，“ IKEA Place”为智能手机用户提供了查看屏幕并与现实生活互动的功能。通过按比例缩放，它使您可以更轻松地决定哪种沙发，床架或椅子适合您的空间。</p><p> By providing this value to IKEA customers, ‘IKEA Place’ proves itself to be an extension of the traditional store, rather than a separate app by the same company. IKEA’s chief digital officer neatly explained this as  “the store experience with the online experience”.</p><p> 通过为宜家顾客提供这种价值，“ IKEA Place”证明了自己是传统商店的延伸，而不是同一家公司的单独应用程序。宜家首席数字官将其巧妙地解释为“商店体验与在线体验”。</p><p>  IKEA Place is, however, just the beginning of the company’s relationship with AR. New concepts are being developed as part of the ‘Everyday Experiments’ projects, such as  Shelve It, which lets users scan their walls and shows real-time options of how a certain type of shelf can be built in your room. Others, like  Point and Repair and  Light Filters, allow a better understanding of one’s surroundings, the former by having your own private interior designer and the latter by helping you figure out how lighting changes the dynamic of a room, at different times, and different seasons. All of this directly available through an app.</p><p>  但是，IKEA Place只是公司与AR关系的开始。作为“日常实验”项目的一部分，正在开发新概念，例如Shelve It，该概念使用户可以扫描墙壁并实时显示如何在您的房间中构建某种类型的架子。诸如Point and Repair和Light Filters之类的其他产品则可以更好地了解一个人的周围环境，前者通过拥有自己的私人室内设计师，而后者则可以帮助您弄清楚照明如何在不同的时间和不同的角度改变房间的动态。季节。所有这些都可以通过应用程序直接获得。</p><p>  What all of this means is that  the future of IKEA will not just be related to furniture. Just as Amazon is not a company selling books exclusively anymore,  IKEA will be playing a much larger role in our lives in the near future. The two may even be each other’s biggest competitor in areas such as smart home appliances and augmented reality or the food sector. IKEA is also aiming to  reach 3 billion customers by 2025, by investing in city-centre locations rather than out of town stores, and offer some of the more requested products and services. This opens new possibilities for IKEA, including the ability to use these city-centre locations to push forward its food products, directly competing with convenience stores like Amazon Go.</p><p>  所有这些意味着，宜家的未来将不仅与家具有关。正如亚马逊不再是专门销售书籍的公司一样，宜家在不久的将来将在我们的生活中扮演更大的角色。在智能家电，增强现实或食品领域，两者甚至可能互为最大竞争对手。宜家还计划到2025年，通过在城市中心地区而不是在城镇外的商店进行投资来吸引30亿客户，并提供一些要求更多的产品和服务。这为宜家带来了新的可能性，包括使用这些城市中心位置来推广其食品的能力，从而直接与Amazon Go等便利店竞争。</p><p> Unlike Amazon, however, IKEA is putting the environment, sustainability, and human health, front and centre in every product and service it creates. As each section above shows, as well as the recent announcements that the company is  removing non-rechargeable alkaline batteries from its stores by October 2021, and is using its supply chains  to produce personal protective equipment, IKEA is putting itself in line with the changing habits of its customers and potential new ones. All of these factors make it even more plausible that a brand like IKEA has the potential to grow to become one of the greatest cultural forces in the world.</p><p> 但是，与亚马逊不同，宜家将环境，可持续发展和人类健康放在其创造的每项产品和服务的首位和中心位置。如以上各节所示，以及最近的公告，该公司将在2021年10月之前从其商店中卸下不可充电的碱性电池，并正在使用其供应链生产个人防护设备，因此宜家将自己与变化的趋势保持一致客户的习惯和潜在的新客户。所有这些因素使得像宜家这样的品牌有可能发展成为世界上最大的文化力量之一，这似乎更加合理。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://karlsnotes.com/ikea-and-the-future-of-living/">https://karlsnotes.com/ikea-and-the-future-of-living/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/宜家/">#宜家</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/ar/">#ar</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
