"note_en": "Scripps Research chemists  Hans Renata, PhD, and  Alexander Adibekian, PhD, (both currently based in Florida, USA) have discovered a way to efficiently create a synthetic version of a valuable natural compound called cepafungin I, which has shown promise as an anti-cancer agent.\n Through this, they were able to understand how the bacterial secretion is able to block a piece of molecular machinery known as a proteasome\u2014a strategy that many existing cancer medications use to destroy tumor cells. They found that cepafungin I bound to not one but two places on the proteasome, enacting a powerful result. Their report appears in the journal   Cell Chemical Biology.\n \u201cBecause cepafungin I is able to engage the proteasome in two ways, it allows for amplification of its effect,\u201d Renata says. \u201cWe showed that this compound elicits many similar downstream biological responses as the FDA-approved chemotherapy bortezomib, while also having certain qualities that may translate into fewer unwanted side effects for patients.\u201d\n  Cepafungin I first intrigued researchers because of its usefulness as an antifungal substance, and later as a promising anti-cancer agent. It kills cells by acting on the proteasome, which is responsible for clearing away the \u201cgarbage\u201d produced by cells. When the proteasome\u2019s function is blocked, cells are overcome with their waste and die.\n But making enough of the compound to be able to study its activity or enable its eventual use a medication has proven challenging, due largely to its complex molecular structure. In the field of chemistry, scientists seek to create the desired structure in as few steps as possible, which leads to cost and time savings. But with complex compounds, that isn\u2019t an easy task.\n The Scripps Research team was able to overcome these challenges and synthesize the compound in just nine steps. For comparison, a related compound known as glidobactin A was synthesized in 21 steps in 1992\u2014and that was considered a landmark at the time.\n The team was able to speed up the process by using certain enzymes that enabled construction of one of the compound\u2019s key building blocks, an amino acid. Then they developed other creative chemistry methods to simplify construction of other parts of the molecule, including a branched lipid portion that was subsequently found to contribute to the compound\u2019s potent activity.\n \u201cOur approach saved us many steps in synthesizing the final compound compared with using classical chemical approaches,\u201d says Alexander Amatuni, a graduate student at Scripps Research and an author of the study.\n  After creating the compound, the chemists discovered that in addition to being exceptionally selective at targeting two sites on the proteasome, it didn\u2019t show any undesired cross-reaction with other proteins in cells, a feature that could make it a better drug candidate.\n Three proteasome inhibitors\u2014bortezomib, carfilzomib and ixazomib\u2014have already been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of multiple myeloma. \u201cBut those medications have some potentially serious side effects, and cancer cells may develop resistance to them over time,\u201d says co-author Adibekian, associate professor of chemistry at Scripps Research. \u201cThere is a need for alternative, more specific proteasome inhibitors.\u201d\n Graduate student Anton Shuster, also an author of the new research, noted that the team\u2019s discoveries were made possible by a close collaboration of labs with different expertise\n \u201cBy combining the two complementary technological platforms\u2014chemoenzymatic synthesis from the Renata lab and chemoproteomics from the Adibekian lab\u2014we were able to succeed,\u201d Shuster says. \u201cHaving the opportunity to work with scientists with divergent research background is what makes working at Scripps Research particularly exciting.\u201d\n Going forward, the scientists plan to continue structure-guided design of similar molecules with alternative structural features in search of useful compounds with superior anti-cancer activity.\n The methods they developed will enable them to change various parts of the structure with relative ease, Amatuni says, allowing for further investigation of biological activity. \u201cThe emphasis on translational research at Scripps Research enables this discovery,\u201d Adibekian says. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about developing the molecule further.\u201d\n   Full study: \u201cConcise

"note_en": "About five years ago, frustration at John Deere&#39;s  draconian tractor DRM culminated in a grassroots &#34;right to repair&#34; movement. The company&#39;s crackdown on &#34;unauthorized repairs&#34; turned countless ordinary citizens into technology policy activists, after DRM and the company&#39;s EULA prohibited the lion&#39;s share of repair or modification of tractors customers thought they owned. These restrictions only worked to drive up costs for owners, who faced either paying significantly more money for &#34;authorized&#34; repair, or toying around with  pirated firmware just to ensure the products they owned actually worked.\n Since then, the right to repair movement has expanded dramatically, with a heavy focus on companies like Apple, Microsoft, Sony and their attempts to monopolize repair, driving up consumer costs, and resulting in greater waste.\n It has also extended into the medical arena, where device manufacturers enjoy a monopoly on tools, documentation, and replacement parts, making it a  nightmare to get many pieces of medical equipment repaired. That has, unsurprisingly, become even more of a problem during the COVID-19 pandemic due to mass hospitalizations and resource constraints, with medical professionals being forced to use grey market parts or DIY parts just to get ventilators to work.\n Hoping to give the movement a shot of adrenaline, Senator Ron Wyden and Representative Yvette D. Clark have introduced the  Critical Medical Infrastructure Right-to-Repair Act of 2020 (pdf), which would exempt medical equipment owners and &#34;servicers&#34; from liability for copying service materials or breaking DRM if it was done so to improve COVID-19 aid. The legislation also pre-empts any agreements between hospitals and equipment manufacturers preventing hospital employees from working on their own equipment, something that&#39;s also become more of a problem during the pandemic.\n  &#34;There is no excuse for leaving hospitals and patients stranded without necessary equipment during the most widespread pandemic to hit the U.S. in 100 years,\u201d Wyden said. \u201cIt is just common sense to say that qualified technicians should be allowed to make emergency repairs or do preventative maintenance, and not have their hands tied by overly restrictive contracts and copyright laws, until this crisis is over.&#34;\n While numerous states have attempted to pass right to repair legislation, none have succeeded so far. In large part because companies like Apple have lobbied extensively to thwart them, (falsely) claiming that letting customers and independent repair merchants fix devices (usually for far less money) would be a privacy and security nightmare. In Nebraska, Apple even tried to claim that such legislation would turn the state into a  mecca for hackers (sounds pretty cool to me, but what do I know). Apple has also spent years  bullying a small repair shop in Norway because he used refurbished Apple parts to fix devices.\n This is the first time such legislation will be proposed on the federal level. As such, likely seeing it as a gateway to broader legislation, companies like Apple, Microsoft, Sony, and John Deere will now likely do their best to (quietly) kill it, despite the positive impact it could have during a pandemic.", "posttime": "2020-08-10 03:54:13", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u56fd\u5bb6,national,\u7ef4\u4fee", "title": "\u56fd\u4f1a\u5c06\u9996\u6b21\u5ba1\u8bae\u56fd\u5bb6\u4fee\u6cd5\u6743\u5229", "title_en": "Congress to consider National Right To Repair law for first time", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200806/10465645059/congress-to-consider-national-right-to-repair-law-first-time.shtml", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u56fd\u5bb6", "national", "\u7ef4\u4fee"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "0ebdee29eafb29efb711621f757d5e37.jpg", "infoid": 1017241, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5982\u679c\u6211\u4eec\u80fd\u7528\u591a\u4f59\u7684\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3\u505a\u4e00\u4e9b\u6709\u7528\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6355\u83b7\u5b83\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u5b83\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u628a\u5b83\u6df1\u57cb\u5728\u6d77\u5e95\uff0c\u90a3\u4e0d\u662f\u5f88\u68d2\u5417\uff1f\u963f\u8d21\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u5df2\u7ecf\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cbe\u786e\u505a\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "note_en": "Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if we could do something useful with excess carbon dioxide other than  capture it, compress it, and bury it deep in the bottom of the ocean?

"note_en": "In 1962, when she was still in middle school in a coastal town of Japan, the cartoonist Kuniko Tsurita sent a despairing letter to  The City, a popular comics magazine. Manga was her life. The 14-year-old loved reading a variety of genres, including  sh\u014djo, which was aimed at adolescent girls, and the more male-targeted  kashi-hon, which often featured grit, gore, and gunfights. Tsurita had dreamed for years of becoming a  mangaka, or manga artist. But her repeated failure to win any of the contests that she submitted her comics to had dimmed her hopes. \u201cFrom the moment I wake up, until late in the night, I spend all my time drawing manga,\u201d her letter read. \u201cI have been submitting work to you for some time now, but am embarrassed by the fact that I\u2019ve never ranked above fourth place. This has really made me realize just how difficult comics are (much harder than school exams, for sure).\u201d\n   If Tsurita\u2019s letter was subdued, the response she received from the all-male editorial staff was bleaker still. \u201cIt looks,\u201d the reply read, \u201clike you\u2019ve been drawing action stories, but I would recommend you stick with subject matter that you\u2019re familiar with and draw about girls instead.\u201d The naked sexism of the recommendation was unsurprising. The world of manga in the 1960s echoed Japan\u2019s stark gender divisions; significantly more men were published in the field than women. Beyond that, women cartoonists were primarily expected to draw  sh\u014djo, which, in those days, typically followed formulaic heterosexual-romance plots and was tacitly aimed at preparing its young readership for the societal norms of womanhood\u2014namely finding and supporting a husband.\n    Tsurita, however, had little interest in creating work that upheld gender norms. Although  sh\u014djo would become more complex and even transgressive in the \u201970s, Tsurita viewed it in the \u201960s as a category both limited and limiting. She liked comics aimed at men and craved the freedom to write and draw whatever she wished. She had nearly given up, though, when  Garo appeared in 1964. An alt-manga magazine that explicitly offered amateur artists a space to try out aesthetic experiments,  Garo became her comics\u2019 home base until her death in 1985 from lupus. The magazine gave Tsurita room to publish the dark, dreamlike work that she desired.\n  Her iconoclastic work is the subject of a new book,   The Sky Is Blue With a Single Cloud, a career-spanning collection of Tsurita\u2019s comics, released this summer by Drawn &amp; Quarterly. The first authorized anthology to showcase Tsurita\u2019s work in English, it includes an exhaustively researched afterword by Ryan Holmberg (adapted and expanded from a shorter piece by Mitsuhiro Asakawa). The essay, which recounts the story of young Tsurita\u2019s letter in great detail, seeks to explain her place in the heavily gendered world of Japanese manga, particularly alternative or alt-manga. While the comics assembled here are uneven in quality, and though the introductory essay may seem intimidatingly academic to readers unfamiliar with early manga, the book is overall a fantastic, continually surprising look at one of Japan\u2019s most innovative\u2014and least remembered\u2014manga artists.\n  Tsurita was the only woman consistently published in  Garo in its early years, and what made her stand out even more was the literariness of her best work. \u201cThere weren\u2019t \u2026 that many female cartoonists back then, so you have to understand how special she was for that reason alone,\u201d  Garo\u2019s co-founder, publisher, and head editor, Katsuichi Nagai, reflected in 1982. Later, he added that what set Tsurita apart from other women  mangaka of the era, such as Masako Watanabe or Hideko Mizuno, was that she was clearly \u201ctrying to make manga like works of literature.\u201d Some of Tsurita\u2019s cartoons were akin to  gekiga, an intensely personal form pioneered by Yoshihiro Tatsumi that often read like snapshots of a life, but many of her comics broke genre barriers altogether.\n  As Holmberg catalogs throughout his essay, Tsurita\u2019s art shifted over the course of her career, betokening her many cross-cultural influences. In some early comics, such as \u201cNonsense\u201d (1966), a circular tale about a man who kills evildoers because he thinks that is his God-given duty, Tsurita\u2019s art appears simple, almost crude. By contrast, \u201cWoman,\u201d from later that year, with its stunning black-and-white backgrounds and near-complete lack of dialogue, hearkens to the modernist  wordless novels of Lynd Ward in the early 20th century. As Holmberg speculates, the manga\u2019s lushly illustrated design was likely a response to  Young Aphrodites (1963), a Greek art-house film that featured similar characters and settings.\n  Other manga, such as \u201cMoney\u201d (1974) and \u201cMax\u201d (1975), portray languid, cigarette-smoking, black-clad women who often look as though they could have been drawn by Marjane Satrapi\u2014albeit with sharp lines and shading that seem to echo Tsurita\u2019s interest in the German artist K\u00e4the Kollwitz. The collection\u2019s titular comic features a haunting Grecian landscape reminiscent of the paintings of Giorgio de Chirico, and an androgynous figure who rides a motorcycle through a seemingly empty world toward a cloud: a mushroom-shaped mass, rendered across a large, stunningly shaded panel. Later pieces, such as \u201cThe Sea Snake and the Big Dipper,\u201d resemble the fantastical, seductive illustrations of the  fin de si\u00e8cle artist Aubrey Beardsley, whose style Tsurita admired. The quality of Tsurita\u2019s late work is remarkable, given how severely lupus ravaged her ability to draw; before her death, she was barely able to finish tracing the lines of her panels.\n    She was also influenced by Japanese painters and manga artists, including Yoshiharu Tsuge and Seiichi Hayashi; the latter\u2019s 1971  Garo cover of a kimonoed woman seems to appear, in an aesthetic echo, in a panel of Tsurita\u2019s surreal comic, \u201cMy Wife Is an Acrobat.\u201d Some of Tsurita\u2019s figures recall the sensuous posters and paintings of the avant-garde artist Aquirax Uno, whose images freely blend the tropes of Art Nouveau with the iconography of Edo-period artworks.\n Notably, Tsurita\u2019s manga influences tended to be men, a fact that reflects both the relative paucity of women in alt-manga then and Tsurita\u2019s distaste for conforming to the stereotypes of  sh\u014djo: smiling girls with wide, sparkly eyes and fashionable haircuts who swooned over boys. Tsurita\u2019s protagonists were sometimes men, as in \u201cNonsense,\u201d \u201cAnti,\u201d or \u201cMr. Jin Roku,\u201d but many of her comics featured women in complicated roles and functioned as subtle commentaries on the paralyzing weight of sexist expectations in a patriarchal society.\n  For instance, as Holmberg\u2019s essay explains, the title of the manga \u201cWoman\u201d was a bit \u201cbolder\u201d in Japanese than it might seem in English: The term used\u2014 onna\u2014was often an insult at the time, connoting \u201cfemale bodies and subjects in a raw state, as pure sex, or as social aberrations,\u201d and was reclaimed in the \u201970s by radical feminists. Tsurita\u2019s \u201cWoman,\u201d which seems set during humanity\u2019s earliest days, poignantly captures a woman betrayed by a man who has callously replaced her with another woman; she is beaten by him and, in turn, by the patriarchal assumptions that others make once they see that she has been rejected. The only word that appears in the comic is his name; she says it once, but his cruelty silences her for the rest of the manga, like other women who have been victims of trauma and have not felt able to speak up.\n The other women that Tsurita drew ranged widely. Some are glowering and melancholy, like the eponymous protagonist of \u201cPrincess Rokunomiya.\u201d Others are tomboys clad in gender-neutral attire, as in \u201cSounds\u201d and, most notably, the 1969 lesbian story that  Garo refused to publish, \u201cOccupants,\u201d which features a classically femme girl and her androgynous roommate, who appear to have sex in a dreamlike sequence. \u201cOccupants,\u201d unpublished in her lifetime, is one of the special joys of  The Sky Is Blue With a Single Cloud, showing Tsurita at her most atmospherically oneiric and representationally unafraid.\n  The queerness in \u201cOccupants\u201d can be read, to a degree, as presaging the burgeoning market for depictions of  yuri, or \u201cgirl love,\u201d in more subversive  sh\u014djo in the 1970s; had  Garo accepted it, the magazine would have been one of the first alt-manga publications to feature an openly lesbian relationship. But the more plausible raison d\u2019\u00eatre for \u201cOccupants\u201d was simply Tsurita\u2019s predilection for depicting gender nonconformity and queer desire, albeit in coded forms. She often included cameos of herself in her manga, in the form of short-haired, androgynous characters; these authorial avatars were not infrequently portrayed as ogling women, as in \u201cThe Struggle for Survival,\u201d a 1967 comic featuring panels of a Tsuritaesque figure gazing at a passing woman in a minidress, thick makeup, and an elaborate coiffure.\n    These moments captured a larger truth about Tsurita, who frequently transgressed the traditional roles expected of Japanese women. She smoked in public, something common for men but virtually verboten for \u201cdecent\u201d women. More disruptive still, she frequently went to pornography theaters by herself, an act that her husband, Naoyuki Takahashi, described in an interview with Holmberg as \u201crare for a woman to do\u00a0 \u2026 even now, and \u2026 unheard of back then.\u201d She sought out sexploitation films aimed at older men, like 1968\u2019s popular  The Genealogy of Tokugawa Women, from the cult director Teruo Ishii. \u201cShe was interested in women\u2019s bodies from a man\u2019s perspective,\u201d Takahashi said. When asked about her manga\u2019s queerness, Takahashi responded that Tsurita was heterosexual and had no gay friends. The truth, of course, may be unknowable, and speculating about Tsurita\u2019s identity from her work and these anecdotes is imprudent. What is clear is that she was unafraid to be a gender outlaw of sorts, both on and off the page.\n  As Holmberg muses, the uncategorizable quality of Tsurita\u2019s manga may partially account for how little has been written about her. Tsurita\u2019s work straddles genres, and the philosophical questions she explores\u2014the Cartesian question of existence in \u201cSounds,\u201d the bleak Sartrean existentialism of her more morbid stories in which characters question the value in living\u2014offer additional intellectual challenges. Moreover, as Holmberg posits, scholars studying manga tend to focus on specific genres, and because Tsurita\u2019s work doesn\u2019t neatly fit into any one area, critics have largely left her alone.

"note_en": "In December 2019 I wrote about  The Growing Problem of Malicious Relays on the Tor Network with the motivation to rise awareness and to improve the situation over time. Unfortunately instead of improving, things have become even worse, specifically when it comes to malicious Tor exit relay activity.\n Tor exit relays are the last hop in the chain of 3 relays and the only type of relay that gets to see the connection to the actual destination chosen by the Tor Browser user. The used protocol (i.e. http vs. https) by the user decides whether a malicious exit relay can actually see and manipulate the transferred content or not.\n In this post I want to give you an update on the malicious Tor relay situation for the first seven months of 2020 by looking at a single large scale malicious actor that is of ongoing concern. It demonstrates once more that current checks are insufficient to prevent such large scale attacks.\n  So far 2020 is probably the worst year in terms of malicious Tor exit relay activity since I started monitoring it about 5 years ago. As far as I know this is the first time we uncovered a malicious actor running more than 23% of the entire Tor network\u2019s exit capacity. That means roughly about one out of 4 connections leaving the Tor network were going through exit relays controlled by a single attacker.\n Figure 1 shows what accumulated fraction of the Tor network\u2019s exit capacity was controlled by the malicious actor and how many confirmed malicious relays were concurrently running (peak at over 380 relays). Figure 1 also tells us that we opened up Tor Browser at the peak of the attack on 2020\u201305\u201322 you had a 23.95% chance to end up choosing an attacker controlled Tor exit relay. Since Tor clients usually use many Tor exit relays over time the chance to use a malicious exit relay increases over time.\n  The relay count line in Figure 1 shows that they added relays in big junks, which gives  OrNetRadar (a relay group detector) the opportunity to detect them and it did in multiple cases (see Appendix). Most notably you can see a spike in relay count in March 2020. On  2020\u201303\u201316 OrNetRadar and the  Tor Project\u2019s Sybil Attack detection reported a sudden spike of over 150 new relays. Something that basically never happens in such a short period of time. They got removed at the time, but were allowed to join the network 3 days later after the malicious operator contacted the bad-relays mailing list and configured the so called \u201cMyFamily\u201d setting to declare themselves as a group. Currently there are no further requirements to run such a large group of Tor relays.\n  The 3 sharp drops in figure 1 (marked with 1, 2, 3) depict the events when some of these malicious Tor exits got detected, reported and removed from the network by the Tor directory authorities. This also shows us how fast the malicious entity recovered from a single removal event and that we didn\u2019t detect all of them at the same time. It took them less than 30 days to recover after a removal and reach 22% exit probability again (starting at 4%). It also gives us an idea that they apparently will not back-off after getting discovered once. In fact they appear to plan ahead for detection and removal and setup new relays preemptively to avoid a complete halt of their operations.\n  The temporary removal event served them as a training and all relays that followed had presumably perfect MyFamily configuration, with one important caveat: Instead of declaring all of their relays in a single group they pretended to be multiple relay groups without linking them directly together. A strategy they followed from the beginning (January 2020). Figure 2 shows their exit probability by family contact information (stacked graph).\n  Figure 3 shows how many malicious exit relays this particular actor operated split by given relay ContactInfo (stacked graph).\n  Contact information can be arbitrarily set by a relay operator so this information needs to be take with some caution, but since multiple of these email addresses interacted with the Tor Project\u2019s bad-relays mailing list, there is some confidence that all these addresses actually exists and are controlled by the malicious relay operator. They even impersonated the FBI by creating an address \u201cfbirelays@\u2026\u201d (This email address was never used to contact the bad-relays mailing list. No, I don\u2019t believe the FBI has anything to do with these relays). We can see that the attacker likes to use common email providers (hotmail, protonmail and gmail).\n   One key question of malicious relay analysis always is: What hosting companies did they use? So here is a break down by used internet service provider. It is mostly OVH (one of the \u2014 generally speaking \u2014 largest ISPs used for Tor relays). Frantech, ServerAstra and Trabia Network are also known providers for relays. \u201c Nice IT Services Group\u201d looks interesting, since I\u2019ve never seen relays on this obscure network before the attacker added some of his relays there on  2020\u201304\u201316.\n  The full extend of their operations is unknown, but one motivation appears to be plain and simple: profit. They perform person-in-the-middle attacks on Tor users by manipulating traffic as it flows through their exit relays. They (selectively) remove HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects to gain full access to plain unencrypted HTTP traffic without causing TLS certificate warnings. It is hard to detect for Tor Browser users that do not specifically look for the \u201chttps://\u201d in the URL bar. This is a well known attack called \u201c ssl stripping\u201d that exploits the fact that user rarely type in the full domain starting with \u201chttps://\u201d. There are established countermeasures, namely  HSTS Preloading and  HTTPS Everywhere, but in practice many website operators do not implement them and leave their users vulnerable to this kind of attack. This kind of attack is not specific to Tor Browser. Malicious relays are just used to gain access to user traffic. To make detection harder, the malicious entity did not attack all websites equally. It appears that they are primarily after cryptocurrency related websites \u2014 namely multiple bitcoin mixer services. They replaced bitcoin addresses in HTTP traffic to redirect transactions to their wallets instead of the user provided bitcoin address. Bitcoin address rewriting attacks are not new, but the scale of their operations is. It is not possible to determine if they engage in other types of attacks.\n I\u2019ve reached out to some of the known affected bitcoin sites, so they can mitigate this on a technical level using HSTS preloading. Someone else submitted HTTPS-Everywhere rules for the known affected domains (HTTP Everywhere is installed by default in Tor Browser). Unfortunately none of these sites had HSTS preloading enabled at the time. At least one affected bitcoin website deployed HSTS preloading after learning about these events.\n  If we look at the overall advertised exit bandwidth on the Tor network and highlight the malicious capacity, that got removed by Tor directory authorities, we can see a significant increase in advertised exit capacity after the latest removal around 2020\u201306\u201321. This part of the curve actually looks similar to the previous month when the attacker recovered it\u2019s capacity after they got removed for the first time around 2020\u201305\u201322. I added an \u201cexpected\u201d line to the graph to show where I would roughly expect the overall capacity to be without unusual growth (approximately calculated by adding the amount of advertised bandwidth known operators did add after the removal event).\n  Figure 6 shows the impact the malicious operator had on the probability that a Tor Browser user would choose one of the known organizations running Tor exit capacity (like those mentioned on  https://torservers.net/partners.html and others active in the tor-relay community since an extended amount of time). The attacker was able to reduce their exit probability from usually around ~60% to bellow 50%. This graph also shows that the fraction of these known organizations is decreasing despite the fact that their absolute advertised exit capacity is actually increasing.\n  The fraction of known operators is decreasing, so who\u2019s share is increasing? Figure 7 and 8 show the exit fraction by unknown operators by autonomous system (figure 7) and by relay ContactInfo (figure 8). The graphs only show networks and ContactInfos with a significant fraction (&gt;0.5% exit probability). The graphs show that the network fraction by the hosters OVH (heavily used by this attacker previously) and Liteserver Holding did significantly increase after the removal event around 2020\u201306\u201321 and that two huge (&gt;5% exit capacity each), new and unknown ContactInfos showed up.\n  These and some additional indicators, which I\u2019m not publishing to avoid burning them, suggest that the attacker is not gone, but since exploitation of known victims became harder, the attacker might has chosen new victims or other types of attacks. This is an ongoing analysis and details might get published in a follow-up blog post.\n   After the  blog post from December 2019 the Tor Project had some promising  plans for 2020 with a dedicated person to drive improvements in this area, but due to the recent COVID19 related  layoffs that person got  assigned to an other area. In addition to that, Tor directory authorities apparently are no longer removing relays  they used to remove since 2020\u201306\u201326. It is unclear what triggered this policy change but someone apparently likes it and is adding  undeclared  relay  groups (that used to get removed due to missing ContactInfo and MyFamily). This means the discovery of the  attacker that did run over 10% of the Tor network\u2019s guard capacity in December 2019 apparently did not lead to any improvements. Since previous reports have not been acted or responded upon yet since over a month I\u2019ve stopped reporting relays for removal, but let\u2019s leave that issue aside for the moment (topic for a separate blog post) and let\u2019s just keep in mind that the Tor Project has no dedicated resources to tackle this (relevant information when trying to make some progress).\n  \u201cwe lack the tools for tracking and visualizing which relays we trust\u201d \u2014  Roger Dingledine\n It is crucial to notice when the Tor network\u2019s known vs. unknown fractions significantly change. I\u2019m aiming to tackle this by incorporating graphs like figure 6 and 7 into the daily generated OrNetStats, but I\u2019m only able to accomplish that when verification of some static operator identifier can be automated since manual verification is too time consuming on the long run. I\u2019m working on version 2 of the  ContactInfo Information Sharing Specification to provide Tor relay operators with two easy to implement options to allow for automated verification of the \u201c operatorurl\u201d field. Verified fields can then be used as an input for the manual assignment (done once) of a \u201cknown\u201d label which is then used for the graphs. Once version 2 of the specification is released (that should happen before the end of August 2020) and deployed by enough relay operators, such graphs can be added to OrNetStats and other tools. This is also aiming to help with Roger Dingledine\u2019s  plans on this matter. One crucial factor will be the adoption of the version 2 specification by relay operators.\n  How do we make it more expensive and time consuming for malicious actors to run such a big chunk of the the Tor network on an ongoing basis? Currently there are no requirements for (large scale) Tor relay operators. So currently there is nothing that stops a malicious actor from adding 150 malicious relays, as has been demonstrated by this attack in March 2020.\n The following suggestions are taking into account that the Tor Project has no dedicated resources to address this issue.\n As an immediate countermeasure against this ongoing issue the Tor Project could require physical address verification for all new (joined in 2020) Tor relay operators that run more than 0.5% of the Tor network\u2019s exit or guard capacity. Why 0.5%? It is a balance between the risk of malicious Tor relay capacity and the required effort for verification. Using 0.5% as a threshold is a realistically low number of operators to verify. As of 2020\u201308\u201308 there are just five exit and one guard operator that match these criteria (new and big). Some of them have similarities to previously detected malicious groups. Others are somewhat known with a good reputation already. So the amount for this initial verification is limited to sending 6 letters to a provided physical address (more likely actually 3 since some might not request the physical address verification).\n This is also about empowering those that have to make difficult decisions when handling suspicious relays.\n  Roger Dingledine\u2019s  plan is to allocate a fixed lower boundary to the \u201cknown\u201d operators pool. This limits the damage a malicious operator can do, no matter how good they are at hiding their individual relays / relay groups. This approach is strong but should be combined with the following to further increase the efforts required by an attacker:\n 1. require a verified email address to gain the exit or guard relay flag. Email verification can be fully automated. Since the malicious relay operators can easily register email addresses, this is combined with the second point.\n   Since the disclosure of large scale attacks on the Tor network ( malicious operator did run &gt;10% of Tor\u2019s guard capacity) in December 2019, no improvements with regards to malicious Tor relays have been implemented.\n The malicious Tor relay operator discussed in this blog post controlled over 23% of the entire Tor network exit capacity (as of 2020\u201305\u201322)\n The malicious operator demonstrated to recover their capacity after initial removal attempts by Tor directory authorities.\n There are multiple indicators that suggest that the attacker still runs &gt;10% of the Tor network exit capacity (as of 2020\u201308\u201308)\n The reoccurring events of large scale malicious Tor relay operations make it clear that current checks and approaches for bad-relays detection are insufficient to prevent such events from reoccurring and that the threat landscape for Tor users has changed.\n Multiple specific countermeasures have been proposed to tackle the ongoing issue of malicious relay capacity.\n It is up to the Tor Project and the Tor directory authorities to act to prevent further harm to Tor users.\n  I\u2019d like to thank the person who initially reported some of the malicious relays, which allowed for the broader discovery of this huge malicious Tor exit relay fraction.

"note_en": "At exactly fifteen minutes past eight in the morning, on August 6, 1945, Japanese time, at the moment when the atomic bomb flashed above Hiroshima, Miss Toshiko Sasaki, a clerk in the personnel department of the East Asia Tin Works, had just sat down at her place in the plant office and was turning her head to speak to the girl at the next desk. At that same moment, Dr. Masakazu Fujii was settling down cross-legged to read the Osaka  Asahi on the porch of his private hospital, overhanging one of the seven deltaic rivers which divide Hiroshima; Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, a tailor\u2019s widow, stood by the window of her kitchen, watching a neighbor tearing down his house because it lay in the path of an air-raid-defense fire lane; Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, a German priest of the Society of Jesus, reclined in his underwear on a cot on the top floor of his order\u2019s three-story mission house, reading a Jesuit magazine,  Stimmen der Zeit; Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, a young member of the surgical staff of the city\u2019s large, modern Red Cross Hospital, walked along one of the hospital corridors with a blood specimen for a Wassermann test in his hand; and the Reverend Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, pastor of the Hiroshima Methodist Church, paused at the door of a rich man\u2019s house in Koi, the city\u2019s western suburb, and prepared to unload a handcart full of things he had evacuated from town in fear of the massive B-29 raid which everyone expected Hiroshima to suffer. A hundred thousand people were killed by the atomic bomb, and these six were among the survivors. They still wonder why they lived when so many others died. Each of them counts many small items of chance or volition\u2014a step taken in time, a decision to go indoors, catching one streetcar instead of the next\u2014that spared him. And now each knows that in the act of survival he lived a dozen lives and saw more death than he ever thought he would see. At the time, none of them knew anything.\n  The Reverend Mr. Tanimoto got up at five o\u2019clock that morning. He was alone in the parsonage, because for some time his wife had been commuting with their year-old baby to spend nights with a friend in Ushida, a suburb to the north. Of all the important cities of Japan, only two, Kyoto and Hiroshima, had not been visited in strength by  B-san, or Mr. B, as the Japanese, with a mixture of respect and unhappy familiarity, called the B-29; and Mr. Tanimoto, like all his neighbors and friends, was almost sick with anxiety. He had heard uncomfortably detailed accounts of mass raids on Kure, Iwakuni, Tokuyama, and other nearby towns; he was sure Hiroshima\u2019s turn would come soon. He had slept badly the night before, because there had been several air-raid warnings. Hiroshima had been getting such warnings almost every night for weeks, for at that time the B-29s were using Lake Biwa, northeast of Hiroshima, as a rendezvous point, and no matter what city the Americans planned to hit, the Super-fortresses streamed in over the coast near Hiroshima. The frequency of the warnings and the continued abstinence of Mr. B with respect to Hiroshima had made its citizens jittery; a rumor was going around that the Americans were saving something special for the city.\n  Mr. Tanimoto is a small man, quick to talk, laugh, and cry. He wears his black hair parted in the middle and rather long; the prominence of the frontal bones just above his eyebrows and the smallness of his mustache, mouth, and chin give him a strange, old-young look, boyish and yet wise, weak and yet fiery. He moves nervously and fast, but with a restraint which suggests that he is a cautious, thoughtful man. He showed, indeed, just those qualities in the uneasy days before the bomb fell. Besides having his wife spend the nights in Ushida, Mr. Tanimoto had been carrying all the portable things from his church, in the close-packed residential district called Nagaragawa, to a house that belonged to a rayon manufacturer in Koi, two miles from the center of town. The rayon man, a Mr. Matsui, had opened his then unoccupied estate to a large number of his friends and acquaintances, so that they might evacuate whatever they wished to a safe distance from the probable target area. Mr. Tanimoto had had no difficulty in moving chairs, hymnals, Bibles, altar gear, and church records by pushcart himself, but the organ console and an upright piano required some aid. A friend of his named Matsuo had, the day before, helped him get the piano out to Koi; in return, he had promised this day to assist Mr. Matsuo in hauling out a daughter\u2019s belongings. That is why he had risen so early.\n Mr. Tanimoto cooked his own breakfast. He felt awfully tired. The effort of moving the piano the day before, a sleepless night, weeks of worry and unbalanced diet, the cares of his parish\u2014all combined to make him feel hardly adequate to the new day\u2019s work. There was another thing, too: Mr. Tanimoto had studied theology at Emory College, in Atlanta, Georgia; he had graduated in 1940; he spoke excellent English; he dressed in American clothes; he had corresponded with many American friends right up to the time the war began; and among a people obsessed with a fear of being spied upon\u2014perhaps almost obsessed himself\u2014he found himself growing increasingly uneasy. The police had questioned him several times, and just a few days before, he had heard that an influential acquaintance, a Mr. Tanaka, a retired officer of the Toyo Kisen Kaisha steamship line, an anti-Christian, a man famous in Hiroshima for his showy philanthropies and notorious for his personal tyrannies, had been telling people that Tanimoto should not be trusted. In compensation, to show himself publicly a good Japanese, Mr. Tanimoto had taken on the chairmanship of his local  tonarigumi, or Neighborhood Association, and to his other duties and concerns this position had added the business of organizing air-raid defense for about twenty families.\n Before six o\u2019clock that morning, Mr. Tanimoto started for Mr. Matsuo\u2019s house. There he found that their burden was to be a  tansu, a large Japanese cabinet, full of clothing and household goods. The two men set out. The morning was perfectly clear and so warm that the day promised to be uncomfortable. A few minutes after they started, the air-raid siren went off\u2014a minute-long blast that warned of approaching planes but indicated to the people of Hiroshima only a slight degree of danger, since it sounded every morning at this time, when an American weather plane came over. The two men pulled and pushed the handcart through the city streets. Hiroshima was a fan-shaped city, lying mostly on the six islands formed by the seven estuarial rivers that branch out from the Ota River; its main commercial and residential districts, covering about four square miles in the center of the city, contained three-quarters of its population, which had been reduced by several evacuation programs from a wartime peak of 380,000 to about 245,000. Factories and other residential districts, or suburbs, lay compactly around the edges of the city. To the south were the docks, an airport, and the island-studded Inland Sea. A rim of mountains runs around the other three sides of the delta. Mr. Tanimoto and Mr. Matsuo took their way through the shopping center, already full of people, and across two of the rivers to the sloping streets of Koi, and up them to the outskirts and foothills. As they started up a valley away from the tight-ranked houses, the all-clear sounded. (The Japanese radar operators, detecting only three planes, supposed that they comprised a reconnaissance.) Pushing the handcart up to the rayon man\u2019s house was tiring, and the men, after they had maneuvered their load into the driveway and to the front steps, paused to rest awhile. They stood with a wing of the house between them and the city. Like most homes in this part of Japan, the house consisted of a wooden frame and wooden walls supporting a heavy tile roof. Its front hall, packed with rolls of bedding and clothing, looked like a cool cave full of fat cushions. Opposite the house, to the right of the front door, there was a large, finicky rock garden. There was no sound of planes. The morning was still; the place was cool and pleasant.\n  Then a tremendous flash of light cut across the sky. Mr. Tanimoto has a distinct recollection that it travelled from east to west, from the city toward the hills. It seemed a sheet of sun. Both he and Mr. Matsuo reacted in terror\u2014and both had time to react (for they were 3,500 yards, or two miles, from the center of the explosion). Mr. Matsuo dashed up the front steps into the house and dived among the bedrolls and buried himself there. Mr. Tanimoto took four or five steps and threw himself between two big rocks in the garden. He bellied up very hard against one of them. As his face was against the stone, he did not see what happened. He felt a sudden pressure, and then splinters and pieces of board and fragments of tile fell on him. He heard no roar. (Almost no one in Hiroshima recalls hearing any noise of the bomb. But a fisherman in his sampan on the Inland Sea near Tsuzu, the man with whom Mr. Tanimoto\u2019s mother-in-law and sister-in-law were living, saw the flash and heard a tremendous explosion; he was nearly twenty miles from Hiroshima, but the thunder was greater than when the B-29s hit Iwakuni, only five miles away.)\n  When he dared, Mr. Tanimoto raised his head and saw that the rayon man\u2019s house had collapsed. He thought a bomb had fallen directly on it. Such clouds of dust had risen that there was a sort of twilight around. In panic, not thinking for the moment of Mr. Matsuo under the ruins, he dashed out into the street. He noticed as he ran that the concrete wall of the estate had fallen over\u2014toward the house rather than away from it. In the street, the first thing he saw was a squad of soldiers who had been burrowing into the hillside opposite, making one of the thousands of dugouts in which the Japanese apparently intended to resist invasion, hill by hill, life for life; the soldiers were coming out of the hole, where they should have been safe, and blood was running from their heads, chests, and backs. They were silent and dazed.\n Under what seemed to be a local dust cloud, the day grew darker and darker.\n At nearly midnight, the night before the bomb was dropped, an announcer on the city\u2019s radio station said that about two hundred B-29s were approaching southern Honshu and advised the population of Hiroshima to evacuate to their designated \u201csafe areas.\u201d Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, the tailor\u2019s widow, who lived in the section called Nobori-cho and who had long had a habit of doing as she was told, got her three children\u2014a ten-year-old boy, Toshio, an eight-year-old girl, Yaeko, and a five-year-old girl, Myeko\u2014out of bed and dressed them and walked with them to the military area known as the East Parade Ground, on the northeast edge of the city. There she unrolled some mats and the children lay down on them. They slept until about two, when they were awakened by the roar of the planes going over Hiroshima.\n As soon as the planes had passed, Mrs. Nakamura started back with her children. They reached home a little after two-thirty and she immediately turned on the radio, which, to her distress, was just then broadcasting a fresh warning. When she looked at the children and saw how tired they were, and when she thought of the number of trips they had made in past weeks, all to no purpose, to the East Parade Ground, she decided that in spite of the instructions on the radio, she simply could not face starting out all over again. She put the children in their bedrolls on the floor, lay down herself at three o\u2019clock, and fell asleep at once, so soundly that when planes passed over later, she did not waken to their sound.\n The siren jarred her awake at about seven. She arose, dressed quickly, and hurried to the house of Mr. Nakamoto, the head of her Neighborhood Association, and asked him what she should do. He said that she should remain at home unless an urgent warning\u2014a series of intermittent blasts of the siren\u2014was sounded. She returned home, lit the stove in the kitchen, set some rice to cook, and sat down to read that morning\u2019s Hiroshima  Chugoku. To her relief, the all-clear sounded at eight o\u2019clock. She heard the children stirring, so she went and gave each of them a handful of peanuts and told them to stay on their bedrolls, because they were tired from the night\u2019s walk. She had hoped that they would go back to sleep, but the man in the house directly to the south began to make a terrible hullabaloo of hammering, wedging, ripping, and splitting. The prefectural government, convinced, as everyone in Hiroshima was, that the city would be attacked soon, had begun to press with threats and warnings for the completion of wide fire lanes, which, it was hoped, might act in conjunction with the rivers to localize any fires started by an incendiary raid; and the neighbor was reluctantly sacrificing his home to the city\u2019s safety. Just the day before, the prefecture had ordered all able-bodied girls from the secondary schools to spend a few days helping to clear these lanes, and they started work soon after the all-clear sounded.\n Mrs. Nakamura went back to the kitchen, looked at the rice, and began watching the man next door. At first, she was annoyed with him for making so much noise, but then she was moved almost to tears by pity. Her emotion was specifically directed toward her neighbor, tearing down his home, board by board, at a time when there was so much unavoidable destruction, but undoubtedly she also felt a generalized, community pity, to say nothing of self-pity. She had not had an easy time. Her husband, Isawa, had gone into the Army just after Myeko was born, and she had heard nothing from or of him for a long time, until, on March 5, 1942, she received a seven-word telegram: \u201cIsawa died an honorable death at Singapore.\u201d She learned later that he had died on February 15th, the day Singapore fell, and that he had been a corporal. Isawa had been a not particularly prosperous tailor, and his only capital was a Sankoku sewing machine. After his death, when his allotments stopped coming, Mrs. Nakamura got out the machine and began to take in piecework herself, and since then had supported the children, but poorly, by sewing.\n As Mrs. Nakamura stood watching her neighbor, everything flashed whiter than any white she had ever seen. She did not notice what happened to the man next door; the reflex of a mother set her in motion toward her children. She had taken a single step (the house was 1,350 yards, or three-quarters of a mile, from the center of the explosion) when something picked her up and she seemed to fly into the next room over the raised sleeping platform, pursued by parts of her house.\n Timbers fell around her as she landed, and a shower of tiles pommelled her; everything became dark, for she was buried. The debris did not cover her deeply. She rose up and freed herself. She heard a child cry, \u201cMother, help me!,\u201d and saw her youngest\u2014Myeko, the five-year-old\u2014buried up to her breast and unable to move. As Mrs. Nakamura started frantically to claw her way toward the baby, she could see or hear nothing of her other children.\n  In the days right before the bombing, Dr. Masakazu Fujii, being prosperous, hedonistic, and, at the time, not too busy, had been allowing himself the luxury of sleeping until nine or nine-thirty, but fortunately he had to get up early the morning the bomb was dropped to see a house guest off on a train. He rose at six, and half an hour later walked with his friend to the station, not far away, across two of the rivers. He was back home by seven, just as the siren sounded its sustained warning. He ate breakfast and then, because the morning was already hot, undressed down to his underwear and went out on the porch to read the paper. This porch\u2014in fact, the whole building\u2014was curiously constructed. Dr. Fujii was the proprietor of a peculiarly Japanese institution, a private, single-doctor hospital. This building, perched beside and over the water of the Kyo River, and next to the bridge of the same name, contained thirty rooms for thirty patients and their kinfolk\u2014for, according to Japanese custom, when a person falls sick and goes to a hospital, one or more members of his family go and live there with him, to cook for him, bathe, massage, and read to him, and to offer incessant familial sympathy, without which a Japanese patient would be miserable indeed. Dr. Fujii had no beds\u2014only straw mats\u2014for his patients. He did, however, have all sorts of modern equipment: an X-ray machine, diathermy apparatus, and a fine tiled laboratory. The structure rested two-thirds on the land, one-third on piles over the tidal waters of the Kyo. This overhang, the part of the building where Dr. Fujii lived, was queer-looking, but it was cool in summer and from the porch, which faced away from the center of the city, the prospect of the river, with pleasure boats drifting up and down it, was always refreshing. Dr. Fujii had occasionally had anxious moments when the Ota and its mouth branches rose to flood, but the piling was apparently firm enough and the house had always held.\n  Dr. Fujii had been relatively idle for about a month because in July, as the number of untouched cities in Japan dwindled and as Hiroshima seemed more and more inevitably a target, he began turning patients away, on the ground that in case of a fire raid he would not be able to evacuate them. Now he had only two patients left\u2014a woman from Yano, injured in the shoulder, and a young man of twenty-five recovering from burns he had suffered when the steel factory near Hiroshima in which he worked had been hit.\n Dr. Fujii had six nurses to tend his patients. His wife and children were safe; his wife and one son were living outside Osaka, and another son and two daughters were in the country on Kyushu. A niece was living with him, and a maid and a manservant. He had little to do and did not mind, for he had saved some money. At fifty, he was healthy, convivial, and calm, and he was pleased to pass the evenings drinking whiskey with friends, always sensibly and for the sake of conversation. Before the war, he had affected brands imported from Scotland and America; now he was perfectly satisfied with the best Japanese brand, Suntory.\n Dr. Fujii sat down cross-legged in his underwear on the spotless matting of the porch, put on his glasses, and started reading the Osaka  Asahi. He liked to read the Osaka news because his wife was there. He saw the flash. To him\u2014faced away from the center and looking at his paper\u2014it seemed a brilliant yellow. Startled, he began to rise to his feet. In that moment (he was 1,550 yards from the center), the hospital leaned behind his rising and, with a terrible ripping noise, toppled into the river. The Doctor, still in the act of getting to his feet, was thrown forward and around and over; he was buffeted and gripped; he lost track of everything, because things were so speeded up; he felt the water.\n Dr. Fujii hardly had time to think that he was dying before he realized that he was alive, squeezed tightly by two long timbers in a V across his chest, like a morsel suspended between two huge chopsticks\u2014held upright, so that he could not move, with his head miraculously above water and his torso and legs in it. The remains of his hospital were all around him in a mad assortment of splintered lumber and materials for the relief of pain. His left shoulder hurt terribly. His glasses were gone.\n Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, of the Society of Jesus, was, on the morning of the explosion, in rather frail condition. The Japanese wartime diet had not sustained him, and he felt the strain of being a foreigner in an increasingly xenophobic Japan; even a German, since the defeat of the Fatherland, was unpopular.

Microsoft&#39;s Game Pass, Google&#39;s Stadia, and Facebook&#39;s Gaming app all face roadblocks to publishing on the App Store.\n    &#34;The App Store was created to be a safe and trusted place for customers to discover and download apps, and a great business opportunity for all developers,&#34;  an Apple spokesperson told Business Insider this week. &#34;Before they go on our store, all apps are reviewed against the same set of guidelines that are intended to protect customers and provide a fair and level playing field to developers.&#34;\n Because each company isn&#39;t submitting each game, Apple is blocking the apps that enable access to those games.\n &#34;Our customers enjoy great apps and games from millions of developers, and gaming services can absolutely launch on the App Store as long as they follow the same set of guidelines applicable to all developers, including submitting games individually for review, and appearing in charts and search,&#34; the statement from Apple said. &#34;In addition to the App Store, developers can choose to reach all iPhone and iPad users over the web through Safari and other browsers on the App Store.&#34;\n Given that Apple allows services like Netflix and Spotify without reviewing every piece of content, why not allow a similar service for gaming?\n   The difference boils down to the medium, according to Apple: Games are interactive, unlike music and film, and there are consumer expectations baked into the App Store related to gaming.\n Those expectations extend to game content, but also to searchability, in-app payment through Apple&#39;s built-in services, and App Store charts, according to Apple.\n In order to get published on Apple&#39;s App Store,  Facebook outright removed games from its Facebook Gaming app.\n  Google removed the core component of its app \u2014 the Google Stadia app on iOS doesn&#39;t stream video games to your phone, which is what the service exists to do.\n   And, for the time being, when Microsoft&#39;s Game Pass game streaming service launches on September 15, it will only be available on Android smartphones and tablets.\n &#34;Unfortunately, we do not have a path to bring our vision of cloud gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to gamers on iOS via the Apple App Store,&#34; a Microsoft spokesperson said on Thursday. &#34;Apple stands alone as the only general purpose platform to deny consumers from cloud gaming and game subscription services like Xbox Game Pass. And it consistently treats gaming apps differently, applying more lenient rules to non-gaming apps even when they include interactive content.&#34;\n  &#34;Unfortunately, we had to remove gameplay functionality entirely in order to get Apple&#39;s approval on the standalone Facebook Gaming app \u2014 meaning iOS users have an inferior experience to those using Android,&#34; Sandberg said in a statement shared with Business Insider on Friday. &#34;We&#39;re staying focused on building communities for the more than 380 million people who play games on Facebook every month \u2014 whether Apple allows it in a standalone app or not.&#34;\n    &#34;After months of submissions and repeated rejections by Apple, we&#39;ve had to remove instant games entirely from the standalone app,&#34;  a tweet thread from the account said on Friday. &#34;We can afford to spend ~6 months grinding thru Apple reviews, but many others can&#39;t. And while we could have tried additional appeals, we didn&#39;t want to hold back from launching the version for livestreamers and fans.&#34;\n  What happens next is anyone&#39;s guess, but without support for iPhones and iPads, ambitious services like Xbox Game Pass and Google Stadia will assuredly struggle. iPhone users account for nearly half the US market share of smartphone users,  according to Statista, and iPad is  even more dominant in the tablet market.\n   One thing is certain: Given  how critical Xbox Game Pass is to Microsoft&#39;s future with the Xbox brand, we&#39;ve assuredly not heard the end of this.\n Got a tip?\u00a0Contact Business Insider senior correspondent Ben Gilbert via email ( bgilbert@businessinsider.com), \u00a0or Twitter DM ( @realbengilbert).

"note_en": "Editor\u2019s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of The Economist Today , our daily  newsletter. For more stories and our pandemic tracker, see our  hub\n C  altered life as we know it. When governments imposed lockdowns in March, people transformed their homes into makeshift offices, gyms and pubs. For many, crammed commutes and bustling nightlife became a distant memory. Now that countries have eased restrictions, residents are venturing outside again\u2014but not as much as before. Globally, they made perhaps 25% fewer trips per day in July than they did in early March, according to  The Economist\u2019s analysis of Google\u2019s phone-tracking data.\n Consumer caution has hit some industries harder than others. By training a statistical model on Google\u2019s global search data since 2016, we find that traffic for \u201crestaurant\u201d (or similar words in other languages) is currently 17% lower than we would usually expect for this time of year. Booze stores may be doing better, since searches for \u201changover\u201d have rebounded to a normal level for raucous July, after dwindling by 40% in March. But enquiries for \u201ctickets\u201d are still down by 58%. This newspaper has called the result of such an uneven recovery \u201cthe 90% economy\u201d.\n Even as people are less comfortable going out and about, Google\u2019s data show that they are persisting with home activities they picked up months ago. Take baking, for example. \u201cYeast\u201d quickly became a fad, with searches rising by 280% in April\u2014and by 1,300% in peckish Italy. Global interest has flattened since, but is still 19% above normal. Other gastronomic words show a similar pattern. The increase for \u201ctakeout\u201d, however, has been even greater. Kneading and proofing is not for everybody.\n  Though people are feasting at home, fitness has also become a priority during quarantine. Searches for \u201cdumbbell\u201d and \u201cStrava\u201d, a workout app, remain more than 60% above the usual level, despite gyms reopening. The continued interest in \u201celectric bicycles\u201d and \u201cstanding desks\u201d (especially in America) shows that workers are making their transport and home offices healthier too.\n Likewise, arts and crafts adopted in April have made a lasting mark. Aspiring Picassos have kept searches for \u201cpainting by numbers\u201d at more than double their normal rate. \u201cHair clippers\u201d remain fashionable among amateur barbers, as does \u201ctie-dye\u201d with people willing to spatter their clothes (particularly Germans, who seem to be channelling their inner Jil Sander). As with cooking, however, there are plenty of slouches who lack inspiration for such artistry. Netflix can thank them for a rate of searches that was 23% higher than usual in late July, long after March\u2019s mania for \u201cTiger King\u201d wore off.\n The Google trends for many of these home entertainments suggest that their new popularity may outlast the pandemic.

"note_en": "Everyone knows how to track which processes run on Linux, but almost no-one tracks them accurately. In fact,  all of the methods listed in this post have some deficiency or another. Lets define requirements:\n Within reason, we shouldn\u2019t need to modify or recompile our code for different kernel versions\n Bonus: If the host is a Kubernetes node or runs docker than we should be able to determine which pod/container a process belongs to. To do so, it is often sufficient to know a process\u2019 cgroup ID.   1\n Lets looks at common Linux APIs that can solve this problem. For simplicity\u2019s sake, we\u2019ll focus on detecting  execve syscalls. A full solution will also need to monitor  fork/ clone syscalls and their variants as well  execveat.\n  Use the netlink process connector. The connector will deliver notifications for short-lived processes but the notifications only include numerical data like the process\u2019  pid without data like the executable path. Therefore, you\u2019re back to reading data from  /proc and have the same race condition for short-lived processes.\n Use the Linux audit API. This is the best solution out there. The audit API exists in all modern kernels, provides full executable paths, and won\u2019t miss short-lived processes. There are only two disadvantages. First of all, only one usermode program can communicate with the kernel audit API at a time. This is a pain if you are developing an enterprise security solution and have customers who use the audit API themselves via  auditd or  osquery.  2 Second of all, the audit API isn\u2019t container aware, despite years of kernel mailing list discussions on fixing the issue.\n   Use tracepoints  3 . The kernel contains several relevant tracepoints which execute at different points in the  execve syscall. They are:  sched_process_exec,  open_exec,  sys_enter_execve,  sys_exit_execve.  4 These tracepoints are better than the previous solutions because they will track short-lived processes, but none of these tracepoints provide an executable\u2019s full path when the parameter to  exec is a relative path. In other words, if the user runs  cd /bin &amp;&amp; ./ls then the path will be reported as  ./ls and not  /bin/ls. Here is a simple demonstration:\n # enable the sched_process_exec tracepointsudo -scd /sys/kernel/debug/tracingecho 1 &gt; events/sched/sched_process_exec/enable# run ls via a relative pathcd /bin &amp;&amp; ./ls# fetch data from the sched_process_exec tracepoint# note that we don&#39;t see the full pathcd -cat trace | grep ls# disable the tracepointecho 0 &gt; events/sched/sched_process_exec/enable\n Use kprobes/kretprobes  5. Unlike tracepoints, there are many, many possible functions where you can insert a kprobe which will be hit during an  execve syscall. However, I can\u2019t find a single function in  execve\u2019s callgraph which has as function parameters both the process\u2019 PID and the full path of the executable. Therefore we have the same issue with relative paths as the tracepoint solution. There are some clever hacks you can do here - after all, kprobes can read data from the kernel\u2019s callstack - but these solutions wont be stable across kernel versions so I\u2019m ruling them out.\n Use eBPF programs with tracepoints/kprobes/kretprobes  6. This opens up some new options. Now we can run arbitrary code in the kernel every time that the  execve syscall runs. In theory, this should let us extract any information we want from kernel and send it to usermode. There are two ways of obtaining such data and neither meets our requirements:\n Read data from kernel structs like  task_struct or  linux_binprm. We can indeed fetch the executable\u2019s full path this way  7 but reading from kernel structs will make us dependent on kernel versions. Our eBPF program needs to know the offsets of struct members so it has to be compiled with kernel headers for each kernel version. This is typically solved by compiling the eBPF program at runtime, but that brings it\u2019s own issues like a requirement that you have kernel headers available on every machine.\n Use eBPF helper functions to fetch data from the kernel. This is compatible across all kernel versions that contain the helper you use. In this method you never access kernel structs directly - rather you use helper APIs to fetch data. There is only one problem: there is no eBPF helper function which can obtain the executable\u2019s full path. (However, in recent kernel versions, there  is an eBPF helper function to get the cgroup ID which is useful for mapping processes to containers.)\n  Use  LD_PRELOAD on every running executable and hook  exec calls in libc. Seriously, don\u2019t do this. It won\u2019t work for statically compiled executables, is easy for malicious code to bypass, and is fairly intrusive.\n Use tracepoints on  execve,  fork/ clone, and  chdir to track not only the creation of all processes but also their current working directory. For each  execve lookup the process\u2019 working directory and combine that with  execve\u2019s parameter to obtain a full path. If you do this, make sure you use eBPF maps and put all the logic into your eBPF programs to avoid race conditions where events arrive in usermode in the wrong order.\n Use ptrace based solutions. These are too intrusive for production code. However, if you do go this route then use ptrace + seccomp and the  SECCOMP_RET_TRACE flag. Then seccomp can intercept all  execve syscalls in the kernel and pass them to a usermode debugger which can log the  execve call before telling seccomp to continue with the  execve as usual.\n Use AppArmor. You can write an AppArmor profile which forbids a process from executing any other executables. If you put that profile in complain mode then AppArmor wont actually prevent process execution - it will only issue alerts when the profile is violated. If we attach our profile to every running process then we will have a working but very ugly and hackish solution. You probably shouldn\u2019t do this.\n   Use  ps - this just polls from  /proc and therefore has the usual race conditions\n Use the eBPF-based  execsnoop - this is just a kprobe/kretprobe based solution so it has the same dependency on kernel versions discussed above. Besides, execsnoop doesn\u2019t even expand relative paths so we have gained nothing.\n Use the old non-eBPF version of execsnoop - this won\u2019t work either. It is just a simple kprobe.\n  Use the eBPF helper function  get_fd_path - this doesn\u2019t yet exist, but once it is added to the kernel it will somewhat help. You\u2019ll still have to get the executable\u2019s FD in a way that doesn\u2019t involve reading from kernel structs.\n  None of the APIs covered here are perfect. Here are my recommendations for which solution you should use and when:\n If you can, use the audit API via  auditd or  go-audit. This will log all processes, including short-lived processes, and you\u2019ll get full executable paths without any effort. This solution wont work if someone is already using the audit API via a different usermode tool than you. In that case, read on.\n If you don\u2019t care about full-paths and you want a quick, ready-made solution that doesn\u2019t involve writing any code then use  execsnoop. This has the disadvantage of requiring kernel headers at runtime.\n If you don\u2019t care about full-paths and you\u2019re willing to go the extra mile to avoid requiring kernel headers then use one of the tracepoints mentioned above. There are multiple ways that you can connect to those tracepoints and transfer their data to usermode - whether it is via the filesystem interface shown above, via an eBPF program with eBPF maps, or via  perf tools. I\u2019ll cover these options in another post. The main thing to remember is this: if you use an eBPF program make sure it can be statically compiled so that you don\u2019t have the same dependency on kernel headers that you\u2019re trying to avoid. This means you can\u2019t access kernel structs and you can\u2019t use frameworks like  BCC which compile eBPF programs at runtime.\n If you don\u2019t care about short-lived processes and the previous solutions don\u2019t fit your use-case then use the netlink process connector in conjunction with  /proc\n Have I forgotten an obvious solution? Message me! I haven\u2019t yet setup a commenting system on this website, but you can message me on  LinkedIn.\n There is no such thing as a container or a container ID from the kernel\u2019s perspective. The kernel only knows about cgroups, network namespaces, process namespaces, and other independent kernel APIs which container runtimes like docker happen to implement containerization with. When trying to identify containers via kernel IDs you need a kernel identifier which every container has exactly one of. For docker, cgroup IDs satisfy that requirement.   [return]\n In theory user-mode multiplexers like  auditd and  go-audit can mitigate this issue, but for enterprise solutions you still don\u2019t know if the customer is using a multiplexer, if so which one, and if there are other security solutions present which connect to the audit API directly.   [return]\n tracepoints are probes that are statically compiled into the kernel at set locations. Each probe can be individually enabled so that it emits notifications when the kernel reaches that probe\u2019s location.   [return]\n To obtain this list I ran  cat /sys/kernel/tracing/available_events | grep exec and then filtered the output based on a glance at kernel sources   [return]\n kprobes let you extract debug information from almost any kernel location. You can think of them as kernel breakpoints which emit information but don\u2019t stop execution.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has been  widely praised for  her leadership that saw NZ  lock down hard for several weeks before all domestic  restrictions were lifted in June. She sees her government&#39;s response to and recovery from the coronavirus outbreak as key to her Labour Party being re-elected.\n  \u2014 Ardern&#39;s news briefing remarks  Ardern  announced at a briefing Saturday that Labour&#39;s re-election campaign that is heavily focused on continuing with the economic recovery, pledging NZ$311 million ($205.32m) for a  &#34;Flexi-wage&#34; subsidy scheme to help businesses give jobs to some 40,000 Kiwis.\n The big picture: Labour is well  ahead in the polls of its nearest rival, the National Party, led by Judith Collins. But conservative  Collins told RNZ Saturday she&#39;s still confident of winning under her party&#39;s platform &#34;Strong team, More Jobs, Better Economy.&#34;\n  By the numbers: New Zealand has 23 active coronavirus cases. All are NZ residents newly returned from abroad, who are staying in managed isolation facilities.\n Of note: The border remains closed to non-residents and all newly returned Kiwis must undergo a two-week isolation program managed by  the country&#39;s defense force. All travelers tested three times before they leave.\n Police are  stationed outside hotels where travelers are in quarantine. Officers have taken prosecutorial action against several returned travelers who&#39;ve breached these rules by fleeing the facilities under the  COVID-19 Public Health Response Act.", "posttime": "2020-08-10 02:29:28", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7eaa\u5ff5,zealand,\u65b0\u897f\u5170", "title": "\u65b0\u897f\u5170\u7eaa\u5ff5\u6ca1\u6709\u65b0\u51a0\u80ba\u708e\u793e\u533a\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u767e\u65e5", "title_en": "New Zealand Marks 100 Days of No Covid-19 Community Spread", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.axios.com/new-zealand-no-community-spread-ardern-re-election-cf3a0757-d7af-4fd3-ab2f-c2f909a5e8ac.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7eaa\u5ff5", "zealand", "\u65b0\u897f\u5170"]}]
