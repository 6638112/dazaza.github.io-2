"note_en": "Our species owes a lot to opposable thumbs. But if evolution had given us extra thumbs, things probably wouldn\u2019t have improved much. One thumb per hand is enough.\n Not so for neural networks, the leading artificial intelligence systems for performing humanlike tasks. As they\u2019ve gotten bigger, they have come to grasp more. This has been a surprise to onlookers. Fundamental mathematical results had suggested that networks should only need to be so big, but modern neural networks are commonly scaled up far beyond that predicted requirement \u2014 a situation known as overparameterization.\n In a  paper presented in December at NeurIPS, a leading conference,  S\u00e9bastien Bubeck of Microsoft Research and  Mark Sellke of Stanford University provided a new explanation for the mystery behind scaling\u2019s success. They show that neural networks must be much larger than conventionally expected to avoid certain basic problems. The finding offers general insight into a question that has persisted over several decades.\n  \u201cIt\u2019s a really interesting math and theory result,\u201d said  Lenka Zdeborov\u00e1 of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne. \u201cThey prove it in this very generic way. So in that sense, it\u2019s going to the core of computer science.\u201d\n The standard expectations for the size of neural networks come from an analysis of how they memorize data. But to understand memorization, we must first understand what networks do.\n One common task for neural networks is identifying objects in images. To create a network that can do this, researchers first provide it with many images and object labels, training it to learn the correlations between them. Afterward, the network will correctly identify the object in an image it has already seen. In other words, training causes a network to memorize data. More remarkably, once a network has memorized enough training data, it also gains the ability to predict the labels of objects it has never seen \u2014 to varying degrees of accuracy. That latter process is known as generalization.\n A network\u2019s size determines how much it can memorize. This can be understood graphically. Imagine getting two data points that you place on an  xy-plane. You can connect these points with a line described by two parameters: the line\u2019s slope and its height when it crosses the vertical axis. If someone else is then given the line, as well as an  x-coordinate of one of the original data points, they can figure out the corresponding  y-coordinate just by looking at the line (or using the parameters). The line has memorized the two data points.\n Neural networks do something similar. Images, for example, are described by hundreds or thousands of values \u2014 one for each pixel. This set of many free values is mathematically equivalent to the coordinates of a point in a high-dimensional space. The number of coordinates is called the dimension.\n  An old mathematical result says that to fit  n data points with a curve, you need a function with  n parameters. (In the previous example, the two points were described by a curve with two parameters.) When neural networks first emerged as a force in the 1980s, it made sense to think the same thing. They should only need  n parameters to fit  n data points \u2014 regardless of the dimension of the data.\n \u201cThis is no longer what\u2019s happening,\u201d said  Alex Dimakis of the University of Texas, Austin. \u201cRight now, we are routinely creating neural networks that have a number of parameters more than the number of training samples. This says that the books have to be rewritten.\u201d\n Bubeck and Sellke didn\u2019t set out to rewrite anything. They were studying a different property that neural networks  often lack, called robustness, which is the ability of a network to deal with small changes. For example, a network that\u2019s not robust may have learned to recognize a giraffe, but it would mislabel a barely modified version as a gerbil. In 2019, Bubeck and colleagues were seeking to prove theorems about the problem when they realized it was connected to a network\u2019s size.\n \u201cWe were studying adversarial examples \u2014 and then scale imposed itself on us,\u201d said Bubeck. \u201cWe recognized it was this incredible opportunity, because there was this need to understand scale itself.\u201d\n In their new proof, the pair show that overparameterization is necessary for a network to be robust. They do it by figuring out how many parameters are needed to fit data points with a curve that has a mathematical property equivalent to robustness: smoothness.\n  To see this, again imagine a curve in the plane, where the  x-coordinate represents the color of a single pixel, and the  y-coordinate represents an image label. Since the curve is smooth, if you were to slightly modify the pixel\u2019s color, moving a short distance along the curve, the corresponding prediction would only change a small amount. On the other hand, for an extremely jagged curve, a small change in the  x-coordinate (the color) can lead to a dramatic change in the  y-coordinate (the image label). Giraffes can become gerbils.\n Bubeck and Sellke showed that smoothly fitting high-dimensional data points requires not just  n parameters, but  n \u00d7  d parameters, where  d is the dimension of the input (for example, 784 for a 784-pixel image). In other words, if you want a network to robustly memorize its training data, overparameterization is not just helpful \u2014 it\u2019s mandatory. The proof relies on a curious fact about high-dimensional geometry, which is that randomly distributed points placed on the surface of a sphere are almost all a full diameter away from each other. The large separation between points means that fitting them all with a single smooth curve requires many extra parameters.\n \u201cThe proof is very elementary \u2014 no heavy math, and it says something very general,\u201d said  Amin Karbasi of Yale University.\n  The result provides a new way to understand why the simple strategy of scaling up neural networks has been so effective.\n Other research has revealed additional reasons why overparameterization is helpful. For example, it can improve the efficiency of the training process, as well as the ability of a network to generalize. While we now know that overparameterization is necessary for robustness, it is unclear how necessary robustness is for other things. But by connecting it to overparameterization, the new proof hints that robustness may be more important than was thought, a single key that unlocks many benefits.\n \u201cRobustness seems like a prerequisite to generalization,\u201d said Bubeck. \u201cIf you have a system where you just slightly perturb it, and then it goes haywire, what kind of system is that? That\u2019s not reasonable. I do think it\u2019s a very foundational and basic requirement.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-02-12 23:35:35", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc,\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6,scientists,\u7f51\u7edc", "title": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u505a\u5f97\u66f4\u597d", "title_en": "Computer scientists prove why bigger neural networks do better", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-prove-why-bigger-neural-networks-do-better-20220210/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc", "\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6", "\u7f51\u7edc"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "8907cba0300fd2ae792d8143fffe80e7.gif", "infoid": 1072754, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u65f6\u95f4\u91cc\uff0c\u5927\u7ea630\u4e07\u5e74\u524d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72e9\u730e\u91c7\u96c6\u8005\u751f\u6d3b\u5728\u51e0\u5341\u4eba\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u3001\u5e73\u7b49\u7684\u793e\u533a\u4e2d\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u5730\u7403\u4e0a\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u5730\u7403\u751f\u7269\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5927\u7ea612000\u5e74\u524d\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u5168\u65b0\u4e16\u5730\u8d28\u65f6\u4ee3\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u6c14\u5019\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u6e29\u6696\u7684\u6c14\u6e29\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u5730\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u4e00\u4e9b\u5730\u533a\u5bf9\u91ce\u751f\u8c37\u7269\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u66f4\u5927\u3002\u5728\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\u7684\u51e0\u5343\u5e74\u91cc\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u519c\u4e1a\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u793e\u4f1a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u793e\u4f1a\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u6269\u5f20\u548c\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u5171\u540c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5de5\u4e1a\u6587\u660e\u59cb\u4e8e\u51e0\u767e\u5e74\u524d\uff0c\u5f53\u65f6\u5316\u77f3\u71c3\u6599\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u63a8\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d8\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u597d\u5904\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u7ed9\u6211\u4eec\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u5168\u7403\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u751f\u5b58\u5371\u673a\u3002\u6c14\u5019\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5730\u7403\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u53d8\u66963\u6444\u6c0f\u5ea6\u81f34\u6444\u6c0f\u5ea6\u202f2100\u5e74\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u6444\u6c0f\u5ea6\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u8fbe\u52308\u6444\u6c0f\u5ea6\u202f\u6444\u6c0f\u5ea6\u6216\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u8fd9\u5c06\u4f7f\u5730\u7403\u56de\u5230\u66f4\u65b0\u4e16\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6c14\u5019\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u90a3\u65f6\u519c\u4e1a\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u3002\u53ef\u4ee5\u5236\u5b9a\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5de5\u4e1a\u6587\u660e\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u7834\u574f\u6027\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u72e9\u730e\u91c7\u96c6\u540e\u4ee3\u7684\u524d\u666f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63aa\u65bd\u5305\u62ec\u51cf\u5c11\u957f\u671f\u6781\u7aef\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u653f\u7b56\u3001\u79ef\u6781\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u51cf\u5c11\u653f\u7b56\u3001\u91cd\u65b0\u5305\u88c5\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u73b0\u5b58\u7684\u571f\u8457\u6587\u5316\u3002", "note_en": "For most of human history, about 300,000 years, we lived as hunter gatherers in sustainable, egalitarian communities of a few dozen people. Human life on Earth, and our place within the planet\u2019s biophysical systems, changed dramatically with the Holocene, a geological epoch that began about 12,000 years ago. An unprecedented combination of climate stability and warm temperatures made possible a greater dependence on wild grains in several parts of the world. Over the next several thousand years, this dependence led to agriculture and large-scale state societies. These societies show a common pattern of expansion and collapse. Industrial civilization began a few hundred years ago when fossil fuel propelled the human economy to a new level of size and complexity. This change brought many benefits, but it also gave us the existential crisis of global climate change. Climate models indicate that the Earth could warm by 3\u00b0C-4\u202f\u00b0C by the year 2100 and eventually by as much as 8\u202f\u00b0C or more. This would return the planet to the unstable climate conditions of the Pleistocene when agriculture was impossible. Policies could be enacted to make the transition away from industrial civilization less devastating and improve the prospects of our hunter-gatherer descendants. These include aggressive policies to reduce the long-run extremes of climate change, aggressive population reduction policies, rewilding, and protecting the world\u2019s remaining indigenous

"note_en": "[Note: I had found some cc:mail data files from a long long time ago (long long before trs-80.com was created). These stubs are far from complete, and there seems to be some error in dates, introduced in my attempt to convert the CC:Mail files. The dates below may be incorrect. If anyone knows a good way to convert ancient cc:mail CCA archives to Eudora MBX format, please let me know]  \t\tOn 3/31/1995, my best friend, Rich Buchman, told me about Jeff Vavasour\u2019s Model I emulator. I downloaded it and tried to figure out how to run the Scott Adams text adventures. I registered the emulator on 4/3/1995, and joined the TRS-80 listserve on 4/4/1995.  \t\tThere was already a decent archive of TRS-80 stuff on the web, at \u201cmusie.phlab.missouri.edu/pub/trs/trs-80\u201d and I was in heaven running the old software again.  \t\tOn 4/17/96, I was given a web-accessible account on my then-employer\u2019s test web server \u2026 http://w3.infonorth.com/~ira. It didn\u2019t really focus on the TRS-80, and a lot of friends had trouble accessing it (while some were changing w3 to www, it seemed that DNS was not really quick back in those days). It had my resume and a stock market analysis program I had written. On 4/19/96 I added a findings page (which seemed to be a list of web sites I liked). A visit counter went in on 4/22. As I learned HTML (which I did not know before 4/17/96), I implemented new things, such as image maps, but refused to learn cgi (something I still don\u2019t know to this day).  \t\tAt this point in history, I seemed to have gotten a Pentium 166/Mhz with 32MB of RAM and a 4MB Matrox Millenium video card for $1,600. My mom had just bought a Penitum 100Mhz laptop with 8MB of RAM, a 540MB Hard Drive(?), and a 4x CD reader for $900.  \t\tBy 6/28/1996, I started loading the little bit of TRS-80 stuff I had onto the site (or, more accurately, onto the single page set aside for the TRS-80). I also seemed to have a LITRUG (Long Island TRS-80 Users Group) page as well. By July, people were already sending emails asking to help find some long lost piece of software they had enjoyed using back in the day. On 8/19/1996, Scott Adams had sent me an email advising that the page (it was still just a page) was \u201cFascinating\u201d. On the same day, Robert A Fowkes invited me to \u201ckeep on Orch\u2019in\u201d. I think I had just created a ORCH page that day because a lot of the greats seemed to have gotten into the mix, including Jonathan Bokelman. On 9/13 (yes, this is out of order) Bill Hogue (Big 5 Software) said that I was bringing back a lot of memories \u201cmost of them are even pleasant!\u201d, the same day Peter Trefonas (CLOAD) wrote in.  \t\tThere was a snag though. There was no easy way to get TRS-80 disks converted over to TRS-80 format. There were a couple of utilities which could try to access the data, but these were messy to say the least. The most common way was over the serial port which was DREADFULLY messy.  \t\tHowever, Jeff Vavasour, as part of his Model III/4 emulator package had written a utility which made it much easier to read disks. Called \u201cGETDISK\u201d it was then the only program available which could read a non-Newdos/80 disk (there was an issue with how close NewDos/80 wrote track 0 to the physical center of the disk) and make it a DSK file.  \t\tBut GETDISK was included in the non-shareware Model III/4 emulator package, so I contacted Jeff and asked if he could make this program publically available. Jeff had no problem with doing so, but he had licensed the right to sell the Model III/4 emulator to a distributor, and could not release the program without their approval. Jeff suggested that I contact this distributor and let the owner of the company that Jeff personally was approving its release, if it was ok with him. The request email was sent on 9/3/1996 and the request was rejected on 9/7/96.  \t\tOn my next trip back to New York, [date unknown] I spent 9 straight hours using Rich\u2019s Model 4 and GETDISK (I had registered the Model III/4 emulator) to convert my disks. I would format a blank disk on the IBM, and then used Rich\u2019s Model 4 to copy my TRS-80 formatted NEWDOS/80 disks (which had the track 0 problem I mentioned earlier) to those IBM formatted disks. I would then read the IBM formatted disks using GETDISK.  \t\tThe site seemed to progress very much then as it did now. As various people discovered it, they would get very excited and email. Inquiries as to where to get a TRS-80 repaired, where to buy TRS-80\u2019s, where to find long lost software they had written, started to flow. On 9/9/96 I expressed frustration (to Jeff) as to how many emails I was getting and how much time the site was taking. The well wishes continued to come in, and people did what they could to get me their software (or to ask if I had a copy of their long lost software).  \t\tThe site did manage to grow as various authors sent in their own stuff, and others were spurred to write emulators. Yves Lempereur, who had written the one and only TRS-80 emulator for the MAC had sent over every program he had written (the FunSoft collection). Tim Mann secured permission from Roy Soltoff to release the entire Misosys/Breeze library including LDOS and SuperUtility. The preservation efforts were really on track \u2026 but the most important piece, some way for people to read their own disks so they could be emailed in, was still stuck in \u201cproprietary-land\u201d.  \t\tTo solve this problem, Matthew Reed graciously agreed to write a freeware program which would read TRS-80 disks in an IBM drive. The beta copy of READDISK was provided to me on July 1, 1997, with v1.0 released on July 15th \u2026 as freeware. This would not be the end of Matthew\u2019s GIANT contributions to preserving the TRS-80\u2019s memory.  \t\tOn July 9, 1997, Tandy contacted me telling me that they were preparing 20th Anniversary of the TRS-80 web page and wanted to know if it was ok if they provided a link to my site. I said that it would be my honor! Shortly after their page went live, Ed Juge (YUP!) emailed in told me that he was \u201csurprised to see so much lingering interest in the TRS-80\u201d and that he had found my site through the \u201clinks\u201d portion of Radio Shack\u2019s 20th anniversary page. The site was also written up in \u201cThe Arizona Republic\u201d, also in honor of the 20th Anniversary.  \t\tActually, throughout the site\u2019s operation I would receive a steady trickle of inquiries from various people about the TRS-80 which advised that Tandy had no idea how to answer their questions and referred them to the site for help \ud83d\ude42\n     bonjour,  \t\tJe d\u00e9couvre par hasard votre site\u2026 et j\u2019ai rajeuni de 40 ans.  \t\tPersonnellement, j\u2019ai achet\u00e9 mon TRS80 (unit\u00e9 debase 16k ,extension pour avoir 64k, un \u00e9cran, une imprimante \u00e0 aiguilles et le miniK7\u2026) en 1979 je crois, \u00e0 Brest il me semble.   \t\tJ\u2019\u00e9tais kin\u00e9sith\u00e9rapeute et mon \u00e9pouse m\u00e9decin. Bien s\u00fbr il n\u2019y avait aucun programme sp\u00e9cifique pour la gestion d\u2019un cabinet m\u00e9dical ou para m\u00e9dical. Il y avait \u201cprofile\u201d pour la gestion des fichiers\u2026 et le \u201cbasic\u201d\u2026 pour programmer.  \t\tJe n\u2019avais bien s\u00fbr aucune formation dans ce domaine mais j\u2019ai senti que c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019avenir et j\u2019en ai fait mon pr\u00e9sent.   \t\tJ\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 par petits bouts de programmes, aid\u00e9 par un beau-fr\u00e8re \u00e9tudiant en \u00e9cole d\u2019ing\u00e9nieur et ai appris, vite je trouve \u00e0 exploiter toutes ces possibilit\u00e9s. En quelques mois et ann\u00e9es, jour et nuit j\u2019ai construit un ensemble de programmes reli\u00e9s les uns aux autres et qui permettaient de g\u00e9rer les 2 cabinets m\u00e9dicaux.

Quel miracle\u2026 720k. Pour gagner de la place, je me souviens programmer en basic en supprimant tous les espaces\u2026  \t\tJe l\u2019ai gard\u00e9 longtemps et l\u2019ai donn\u00e9 \u00e0 un club informatique \u00e0 Banyuls que javais cr\u00e9\u00e9 en 2002.  \t\tVoil\u00e0 mon histoire TRS80 dont je suis tr\u00e8s fier. Le programme g\u00e9rait la partie administrative des fiches clients, les bulletins de salaire, le traitement de texte\u2026.  \t\tMerci \u00e0 vous pour ces m\u00e9moires TRS80   \t\tBien cordialement\n     During the early eighties I spent a year using a TRS 80 with a three bay expansion unit writing a book about Lionel Trains. When the book was finished I had a stack of discs about twenty four inches high which went into the attic and were left there when I sold the house. I had a printer which I don\u2019t recall the name of that used folded paper to send the material I typed to the publisher which was used to make the book. When I got a later Tandy Radio Shack with five inch discs after the TRS 80 \u201cTrash 80\u201d stopped saving I got a 50 MB hard drive which was considered large back then.  \t\tI had an 8 inch floppy which as I recall had DOS 3 as my main software. I also had something called Dbase which I used to do\u00c2 research on dating the toy trains. I had other software I can no longer at 82 recall the names of. Several were bought by Micro$oft and used in their later editions.  \t\tI wanted to print out a picture of my original TRS 80 and the Expansion Bay but can\u2019t seem to find the TRS 80. I think it was gray as was the Expansion Bay which had three slots for floppies.  \t\tI presently have an HP Pavilion with a fingerprint reader with win 7. I also have the same with win 8 which I don\u2019t like as well as win 7. The site was interesting but many of the pictures I don\u2019t think I ever saw back then. I never kept any of the 8 inch items because they were just too bulky and I moved around too much.\n     I was introduced to a fellow tenant in my building, an older woman \u201cof a certain age\u201d, who had come upon hard times. She was spry and lovely, albeit a bit eccentric \u2014 and very much afraid that her mind was beginning to go. I saw little evidence of that \u2014 but I did see the shadow of a woman who had once been quite a force of her own. She told me stories of her former life; of her ancestry which dated back to the Mayflower; of former roommates \u2014 all opera buffs \u2014 who all spoke different mother tongues (English, French, German) \u2014 but found they could easily communicate if they used the Italian of Puccini and Verdi .  \t\tIn any case, this woman (I\u2019ll call her \u2018Helen\u2019), could no longer live alone, and was being taken in by a relative in another state. But Helen\u2019s apartment (a rather large 3 bedroom apartment \u2014 which is a commodity coveted dearly in New York City) had been sadly neglected and was stuffed from stem to stern with relics of her former life as an avid reader, as a woodworker, as a crystallographer \u2014 and heaven knows how many other avocations and hobbies. She needed to shed nearly all her belongings except for the clothes on her back. She was moving to a small room in her relative\u2019s home halfway across the country and could not take (and had no need for) her furniture, linens, or other home furnishings. She wasn\u2019t even taking her books with her. Please, she begged everyone she knew and met to take anything they thought they could use.  \t\tIt made her happy to know someone would make use of things \u2014 rather than letting them go to waste and winding up in a dump. She took me from room to room, as we gingerly wended our way thru a Colliers brothers type maze \u2014 and she picked up item after item, begging me to take something \u2014 anything. It also depressed her being surrounded by such disarray and not being able to picture how she would ever get out of her NYC apartment (where she\u2019d lived for 40 years) and how she would \u201cpack\u201d, and what she would do about all her \u201cstuff\u201d..,  \t\tShe showed me linens (still in the original package from 20 years ago); tables and chairs, bookcase after bookcase (mostly with collapsed shelves), a fairly new surge protector (I took it), a printer attached to a parallel cable on one end \u2013 and no computer on the other. She picked up various pieces of old hardware, asking me each time if I could use it \u2014 and each time I told her as kindly as I could to let the landlord dispose of it. It was just too outdated for anyone to use or even donate\u2026 In the last hallway, on my way out, she picked up a dusty black \u201cleatherette?\u201d case from under yet another bookcase \u2014 and, as she started to show me an edge of some REALLY outdated piece of equipment inside it, I sighed sadly and shook my head and told her if the other things were good doorstops, this one was a great brick. \u201cJust leave it behind and the landlord will get rid of it for you\u201d I heard myself say.  \t\tBut after she put it down, a little buzzer went off in my brain, as I thought that equipment was so old even *I* didn\u2019t recognize it \u2014 and I began to wonder what it was. (In the 80\u2019s I was a mainframe/ Cobol/CICS person) \u2013 and though I had gotten involved with PCs early on, had never gotten near or even glimpsed a \u201chobby\u201d computer. I had to look at the label on it to know what it was \u2013 but when I saw TRS-80; I could hardly believe my eyes. It had no power cord, so I figured even if the machine was pristine, I\u2019d never find anything that would fit to power it up. But I thought at least my \u201cex\u201d would get a kick out of seeing it: he had owned a computer store in the 80\u2019s.  \t\tI told Helen it was one of the first personal computers ever made \u2014 and I doubted it was worth very much \u2013 but I would give her any money I gained from it, should that unlikely event happen. Helen\u2019s face lit up \u2013 not because we had discovered a rarity \u2013 and not because there was any possibility of monetary gain \u2013 but because I was actually carrying something out of her apartment!  \t\tWhen I got it home, I examined it more closely. I couldn\u2019t believe it had a place for batteries. Not having known anything about those computers, I was shocked to see it took AAs. Well, there *were* 4 AA batteries still sitting in the bay. But my heart sank when I saw the corrosion and leakage. It was so bad, I was afraid it had leaked beyond the battery bay. I was just so curious by that point, I persisted and cleaned out the bay. But I really didn\u2019t expect the thing to fire up as though it had just been shut down yesterday. I had no idea what I was doing, but starting pushing buttons and got something on the screen. I entered something to it and actually saved a file to it. I felt like the Egyptologist who discovered King Tut\u2019s tomb. Didn\u2019t expect this \u2013 but what an amazing find! A few days later, I showed it to my \u201cex\u201d, who had actually built his own hobby computer once upon a time: he turned it over in his hands and looked like Proust savoring his crumbs of madeleine.\n     In the late 70\u2019s we developed an automatic video tape duplication system for AME, Inc., Burbank, CA, using a TRS-80.  \t\tTheir main business was the duplication of commercials for TV broadcast. This is very labor intensive and easily subject to mistakes. The process consists of cueing a video tape, selecting color bars, then a slate, starting the video playing, selecting it then waiting until the end of the commercial, when the operator would select black while re-cueing the tape, and starting the process over again, and again, and \u2026  \t\tSo we developed a system that ran on a TRS-80 to do these functions.  \t\tThe software was written in assembler, and was burned into a prom, which replaced the original basic prom in the TRS-80.  \t\tWe repainted the buttons, and gave them new labels to ease the operators job.  \t\tWe used the printer port to control the video switcher, and the serial port to control an CMX I2 (Intelligent interface) which was connected to an Ampex VR-2000 (used prices in those days of about $50,000).  \t\tWe also added a TV sync. separator to the TRS-80 to regulate the system timing.  \t\tThis system was used so heavily, that from time to time the internal flat cable between the TRS-80 keyboard and the mother board would break.\n     Hi Ira, great site and its reminded me how I got in to computing \u2026  \t\tI was around 13 or 14 when I saw my first computer, a Tandy TRS-80 Model I Level I 4K machine \u2026 I had wandered in to my local Tandy store on my way home from school while I was doing a newspaper round. Because I was carrying a large newspaper sack the store manager asked me to take it off and leave it with him while I looked around \u2026 I walked up to a rather small display with a Model I computer on it and picked up the BASIC manual and started to look through it and type in some of the programs, I was instantly hooked! I asked the manager how much the manual was and he said I could have it if I delivered a load of their Flyer magazines on my newspaper round .. I of course jumped at the chance That night I started reading the manual from start to finish and soon realised that I needed the computer to get the most out of this new programming lark. So I returned to Tandy and asked if I could come in after school and try out some programming, the manager agreed on the proviso that I wrote some demo programs to show off what the computer could do!  \t\tI carried on visiting Tandy regularly and a year or so later I got a part-time job with them .. in fact I was a part-timer for over 5 years and got to work in five different stores in and around Bristol in the UK. I was awarded a 5 year pin which I still have I got to play with and program lots of different TRS-80 models including Model II / 16 (wow Xenix !), III, 4, Co-cos (big and small), the lovely Model 100 and some of the pocket pcs. From the money I earned I saved up and bought my first computer a Model I Level II 16K machine which later got expanded to 48K and three floppy drives plus a hi-res upgrade. I\u2019ve just got the kit out of the loft and it all fired up first time \u2026 its nice to go back to a machine which I know how it works and I even have the circuit board schematics for !! Its a pity I no longer have most of the programs I wrote including a rather large stock control suite which was used in my local Tandy store.  \t\tLooking through the list of programs on the site it reminded me of all the great games I played .. my favourite was Robot Attack .. such cool speech synthesis through the cassette output and the way it rattled the tape relay was just plain scary! (thankfully mine didn\u2019t burn out).  \t\tThanks to Tandy getting me interested in computers I went on to college to do computer science (writing up my projects using Scriptsit and printing them out on a really LOUD daisywheel printer at the regional manager\u2019s office \u2013 it was still really LOUD even in its own special sound proofing cabinet!). I then went to University and got a degree in Computer Systems Engineering, then did a PhD in Computer Science .. when I ran out of my research grant I managed to get a job at the University working in the Unix Support Team where my love for BSD Unix started and continues to this day with FreeBSD and Mac OS X  \t\tI hope to use resources on this site to get my TRS-80 back in to use .. I built my own RS232C interface and wrote an assembler based driver for it and so I might try using that to connect it up to my network through a Unix box \u2026 hmm, I wonder if I can get SLIP to work\n     Thanks for such a memory inducing site! I still have my Model 1 S/N B006841. I even hand soldered a chip with a toggle switch to get lower case.  \t\tMy first exposure to a computer was to the TRS-80 Model 1 that my sophmore science teacher owned. By this time, I had basically gotten bored with school and I believe it saved me from a doom I\u2019ll never know.  \t\tI had always liked things with push buttons and this was the ultimate. After a year of asking my teacher to stay after school to get to use the computer for \u201cfun,\u201d I decided to take the $300 I had been squirrelling away for an 8-track stereo and ask my parents for the difference to buy the used demo model I had seen in the Radio Shack store 30 miles from home.  \t\tI lived in a small farming town in Kansas and the likelihood that I would have any computer time was grim. But, my parents were the kind that cou\n......", "posttime": "2022-02-12 23:33:41", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4e2a\u4eba,stories,trs", "title": "\u5173\u4e8eTRS-80\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u6545\u4e8b", "title_en": "Personal Stories about the TRS-80", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.trs-80.com/wordpress/personal-stories/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4e2a\u4eba", "stories", "trs"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "13a8afb13b4b83a7af842ef476cb4734.png", "infoid": 1072751, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8857\u673a\u51fa\u6765\u4e86\u6539\u53d8\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u3002\u7acb\u5373\u5411\u516c\u4f17\u63a8\u51fa\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u6f14\u793a\u516c\u53f8\u6b63\u5728\u4f7f\u516c\u53f8\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u521b\u5efa\u6f14\u793a\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u62f1\u5eca\u201d\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c06\u901a\u8fc7\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u5de5\u4f5c\u5982\u4f55\u8fd0\u4f5c\u3002\n\u514b\u62c9\u514b\u548c\u66fc\u52a0\u5170\u4e8e2021\u5e74\u521d\u521b\u7acb\u4e86\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5e76\u4e8e\u53bb\u5e747\u6708\u5728\u79c1\u4eba\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7248\u4e2d\u542f\u52a8\u4e86\u5b83\u3002\u5230\u76ee\u524d\u4e3a\u6b62\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u5019\u8865\u540d\u5355\u4e0a\u6709\u5927\u7ea6300\u4e2a\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c90\u5bb6\u516c\u53f8\u5f00\u59cb\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u514d\u8d39\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e8e\u5230\u76ee\u524d\u4e3a\u6b62\u521b\u9020\u4e86125\u591a\u4e2aArcades\u3002\n\u62e5\u6709\u8425\u9500\u80cc\u666f\u7684Clark\u544a\u8bc9TechCrunch\uff0c\u800c\u5979\u548c\u66fc\u52a0\u5170\u5728\u963f\u7279\u62c9\u65af\u4eba\uff0c\u5979\u8bf4\uff0c\u5979\u8bf4\u5f00\u521b\u4e86\u4ea7\u54c1LED\u589e\u957f\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u8bb8\u591a\u5ba2\u6237\u5728\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e4b\u5916\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u3002\u95ee\u9898\u662f\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u6ca1\u6709\u770b\u5230\u5982\u4f55\u8ba9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\n\u5ba2\u6237\u59cb\u7ec8\u5b58\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u8d2d\u4e70\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u671f\u671b\uff0c\u4f46\u514b\u62c9\u514b\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u51e0\u5e74\u91cc\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5fc3\u6001\u5df2\u7ecf\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c06\u4e0d\u518d\u76f2\u76ee\u6ce8\u518c\u7684\u5fc3\u6001\u8f6c\u5411\u4e00\u4e2a\u3002\n\u65b0\u8d44\u91d1\u5c06\u4f7f\u8857\u673a\u5efa\u7acb\u5176\u4ea7\u54c1\u548c\u7f51\u7ad9\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u8fd8\u671f\u5f85\u6dfb\u52a0\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u4ea7\u54c1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u3002\u514b\u62c9\u514b\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e09\u4e2a\u56e2\u961f\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u652f\u630190\u5bb6\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u4f46\u5979\u5e0c\u671b\u5728\u5e74\u5e95\u4e4b\u524d\u52a0\u500d\u3002\nAditi Maliwal\uff0cUpfront Ventures\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u8868\u793a\uff0cClark\u662f\u4e00\u4f4d\u670b\u53cb\uff0c\u5979\u5df2\u7ecf\u77e5\u9053\u4e86\u51e0\u5e74\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u201c\u5174\u594b\u5730\u8d70\u4e86\u4e94\u5230\u5341\u5e74 - \u5982\u679c\u4e0d\u518d\u65c5\u7a0b\u201d\u3002\n\u4eceGet-Go Maliwal\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u90fd\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5168\u804c\u5ba2\u6237\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u3002\u5979\u8865\u5145\u8bf4\uff0c\u5f53\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u4e9a\u65af\u5766\u4eba\u5de5\u4f5c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u770b\u5230\u4e86\u5c06\u60a8\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u6709\u591a\u5f3a\u5927\u3002", "note_en": "Arcade is out to change that. The interactive demo company, which launched to the public today, is making it easier for companies to create demonstration videos, called \u201carcades,\u201d that walk people through how their tools work.\n Former Atlassian co-workers Caroline Clark and Rich Manalang are behind the company, which also announced $2.5 million in seed funding led by Upfront Ventures, with participation by Sequoia and a group of angel investors, including Mathilde Collin, Laura Behrens Wu, Jaren Glover, Eric Wittman, Jay Simons, Jonathan Widawski and Lenny Rachitsky.\n  Clark and Manalang founded the company in early 2021 and launched it in private beta form last July. It has about 300 on the waitlist so far. Among them, 90 companies started using a free version of the product and have created more than 125 arcades so far.\n  Arcade remembers what you click on so users can make a version of their demo and then embed snippets of the product into websites, blogs and tweets so that people who haven\u2019t used the product before can see it before signing on for a trial.\n Clark, who has a marketing background, told TechCrunch that while she and Manalang were at Atlassian, which she says pioneered the concept of product-led growth, they found that many customers were discovering their products outside of the website. The problem was, they didn\u2019t see a solution for how to make those discoveries better.\n \u201cWe wanted to create a world where people discovered products in an easy and playful manner that clearly showed what they were getting,\u201d she added.\n  Customers have always had expectations of products and tools they are buying, but Clark said in the past couple of years, that mindset has shifted to one where they will no longer blindly sign up.\n Historically, selling involved hiding behind the demo, and once the company got the person\u2019s information, it was more of a \u201cgotcha\u201d moment. One of Arcade\u2019s customers, Clockwork, which works with financial professionals, often asks potential users to connect their invoices to the product so users can see how Clockwork operates, but that is a big ask, Clark said. By utilizing Arcade, Clockwork is able to give potential customers a taste of what their platform is like without uploading that data. Carta is another customer that is deploying arcades across its social media, Clark said.\n The new funding will enable Arcade to build out its product and website as it also looks to add more engineering and product designers. Clark says the team of three have been supporting 90 companies, but she wants to double that by the end of the year.\n  \u201cWe are about helping people know what they are getting into before they load their data,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWe plan to invest more in product updates, integration into other properties and how customers can make a more powerful tool.\u201d\n Aditi Maliwal, partner at Upfront Ventures, said via email that Clark was a friend that she had known for a couple of years and is \u201cexcited to go on a five- to 10 year- \u2014 if not longer journey with.\u201d\n \u201cShe is a values driven, intellectually honest founder,\u201d Maliwal added. \u201cI invest in strong founders, who I believe have founder-market fit and are building an authentic vision. I knew from very early on that no matter what Caroline was building I would want to invest in it. The PLG market is also growing so quickly, and our worlds are almost entirely virtual at this point. The idea of getting on a Zoom or a call with a sales rep in order to try out a vendor\u2019s product feels disruptive to a users\u2019 needs and flow. It should be much easier to for users to simply see an instance of their data on a vendor\u2019s landing page.

(We\u2019ve covered many of them; they include  Brex,\u00a0 Rho,  Juni,  NorthOne,\u00a0 Lili,\u00a0 Mercury,\u00a0 Hatch,\u00a0 Anna,\u00a0 Tide,\u00a0 Viva Wallet,\u00a0 Open and many more; and you could argue Amazon, offering other money management and spending tools, is also in the space.) But Novo sees incumbents as the real \u201cchallenger\u201d here.\n \u201cWe are competing against big banks. They are the only ones we are concerned with because they own 99% of the market,\u201d said Michel Rangel, CEO of Novo, in an interview earlier this month. \u201cWe believe our product is better value for businesses, but we\u2019re happy to see others also pushing the charge forward.\u201d\n  The round is being led by Stripes, with Valar Ventures, Crosslink Capital, Rainfall Ventures, and BoxGroup \u2014 all of whom backed Novo in its  $40 million Series A, just six months ago \u2014 also participating. The startup to date has raised just over $135 million.\n A lot of startups are getting into patterns of raising large funding rounds in rapid succession to ride their respective waves of growth, and to capitalize on the huge opportunity right now to tap deep-pocketed investors looking for smart places to put their LPs\u2019 money. That is very much the case here with Novo, too. The company has seen truly accelerated growth in the last year, and specifically the last six months, both in terms of customer numbers and in terms of how much its app is getting used.\n Novo now has 150,000 SMB customers in the U.S., up by 50,000 on last June\u2019s figures. And Novo has collectively now seen $5 billion in lifetime transactions, up by $4 billion on last June\u2019s $1 billion. The company said that as of this month, it\u2019s on track to see lifetime transactions for 2022 grow to $7 billion (although given it\u2019s only January, that figure is likely to change).\n \u201cThe pandemic was a catalyst for our growth,\u201d said Rangel, who co-founded Novo with  Tyler McIntylre, who is now the CTO. Rangel noted that this Series B came on the back of Stripes approaching Novo \u201cat the tail end of its Series A\u201d after the term sheets had already been signed. Watching its growth after that \u201cvalidated\u201d another quick round of funding, he added.\n  One thing that is very notable about Novo is that, unlike a number of other neobanks, it has not taken the \u201cembedded finance\u201d approach by porting in a number of basic services by way of APIs built by third parties that focus just on infrastructure and backend services. Instead, it decided to build its central functions from the ground up in-house. (It has a large development team, mostly based out of India, Rangel told me.)\n \u201cWe say everything starting from the underlying core processor that powers the bank to what is in the hands of our 150,000 business customers has been built in house,\u201d Rangel said. (Middlesex Federal Savings handles the banking license, FDIC insurance, and access to rails for Novo.) Rangel added that its choice to build was partly done out of necessity, since in 2016 there weren\u2019t many banking-as-a-service platforms to provide those APIs. \u201cThat has unshackled us from someone else\u2019s release schedule, and it means tighter margins,\u201d he continued, but it does have its challenges, for example, in sometimes keeping product focus, and the investment needed to continue maintaining all that technology.\n The company also hasn\u2019t entirely opted out of APIs. Between its Series A and this latest round, the company launched a new Marketplace where it provides APIs for some 1,000 other apps and services that can be integrated into the Novo experience. Here, it focuses on features that sit otutside of the core functionality of a banking service, for example point of sale payments, e-commerce operations, invoice and payroll management and more. This, in fact, can also potentially provide a steer to Novo on what might be most popular and potentially worth considering as in-house products in the future, but for now it serves another couple of key purposes: it makes Novo more useful for its customers, and it provides more data sources to Novo to build future products.\n Chief among those, Rangel said, will be a new lending product where loan applications will be evaluated quickly and (the hope is) more accurately by bringing in and considering a wider set of data that gives a more informed picture of how a business is operating. This is not unlike how, for example, Stripe and Shopify have built their own cash advance and credit products; the difference here is that Novo is intentionally aiming to source as much siloed data as possible to have the most complete picture of a business\u2019s financial health.\n  \u201cDespite being the heart of the U.S. economy, the more than 30 million small businesses in the U.S. have always struggled to access even basic financial services as they are constantly overlooked by the big banks,\u201d said Saagar Kulkarni, a partner at Stripes, in a statement. \u201cWhat sets Novo apart is a fundamentally different approach to helping small businesses succeed. Instead of opting for incremental change, Novo built its banking platform from the ground up so that it could not just deliver a great digital banking experience, but actually deliver de novo financial products to a customer base that is yearning for them. At Stripes, we only invest in companies building amazing products, and Novo\u2019s rave reviews, strong retention, and incredible growth make it clear it has built something that small businesses love.\u201d Kulkarni is joining Novo\u2019s board with this round.\n As the company continues to grow, Rangel said one other area it will be considering is picking up potential smaller players that fit with its bigger strategy. That\u2019s if it doesn\u2019t get acquired itself first. Rangel said it has been approached by at least one significant player in recent years but decided to stay solo. (That may have been for the best for other reasons, too: that company has since been acquired itself, one of the byproducts of changing tides due to the pandemic.)\n \u201cWe\u2019ve done the acquisition dance,\u201d Rangel said, \u201cbut I think we\u2019ll be the ones doing the acquiring now.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-11 21:26:51", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "smbs,led,novo", "title": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc8\u963f\u5bc6\u7684Novo\uff0cSMBS Neobank\uff0c\u7531700\u7c73700\u7c73\u7684\u6761\u7eb9\u57f9\u517b\u4e8690\u4e07\u7cfb\u5217B", "title_en": "Miami-based Novo, a neobank for SMBs, raises a $90M Series B led by Stripes at a $700M valuation", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/novo-the-smb-neobank-nabs-90m-at-a-700m-valuation/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["smbs", "led", "novo"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072748, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u636e\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u53ca\u5176\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u53ca\u5176\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u79f0\uff0c\u9500\u552e\u7ffb\u65b0\u7684iPhone\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u8d44\u91d1\u589e\u52a0\u5230\u4f30\u503c\u81f357\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u8de8\u8d8a\u591a\u5e74\u524d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\n\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u603b\u90e8\u4f4d\u4e8e\u5df4\u9ece\uff0c\u6700\u65b0\u8d44\u91d1\u7b79\u96c6\u4e865.1\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u9886\u5bfc\u6295\u8d44\u662fSprints Capital\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u5bb6\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f26\u6566\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5728\u5176\u5176\u4ed6\u6280\u672f\u516c\u53f8\u63a7\u80a1\u4e2d\u6838\u5b9e\u5728\u7ebf\u652f\u4ed8\u516c\u53f8\u9769\u547d\u3002\n\u52a0\u5165\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u5408\u662f\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u8005\uff0c\u5927\u897f\u6d0b; Eurazeo\u57fa\u4e8e\u5df4\u9ece\u7684\u79c1\u52df\u80a1\u6743\u516c\u53f8; Agla\u00e9DitanBernault\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6295\u8d44 - \u548c\u4f26\u6566\u7684\u4e00\u4ee3\u6295\u8d44\u7ba1\u7406LLP\u3002\n\u7ffb\u65b0\u5668\u548c\u54c1\u724c\u901a\u8fc7Backmarket.com\u76f4\u63a5\u5411\u6d88\u8d39\u200b\u200b\u8005\u9500\u552e\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9500\u552e\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4f63\u91d1\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4e0d\u62ab\u9732\u8d22\u52a1\u72b6\u51b5\u3002\n\u201c\u65b0\u7535\u5b50\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u9500\u552e\u589e\u957f\u548c\u4ece\u5783\u573e\u586b\u57cb\u573a\u8f6c\u79fb\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5b89\u88c5\u538b\u529b\u4f1a\u4e3a\u540e\u8fbe\u5e02\u573a\u8d62\u5f97\u66f4\u591a\u4e1a\u52a1\uff0c\u201dHenrik Persson\uff08Sprint\uff09\u7ba1\u7406\u4f34\u4fa3\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8d62\u5f97\u66f4\u591a\u4e1a\u52a1\u3002\u201c\n\u80cc\u90e8\u5e02\u573a\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u76f8\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u5982Swappa\u548cEcoatm International Ltd.\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u5176\u4e00\u4e9b\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u7269\u54c1\u90fd\u76f4\u63a5\u6765\u81ea\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u7ffb\u65b0\u5668\uff0c\u7ecf\u9500\u5546\u548c\u54c1\u724c\u3002\n\u516c\u53f8\u5e0c\u671b\u7ffb\u65b0\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u53ef\u4ee5\u590d\u5236\u4e8c\u624b\u8f66\u5e02\u573a\u3002\u7ecf\u8fc7\u7ffb\u65b0\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u5360\u5168\u7403\u5168\u7403\u7535\u5b50\u4ea7\u54c1\u5168\u9500\u552e\u989d\u76846\uff05\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea670\uff05\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\u8d2d\u4e70\u6c7d\u8f66\uff0cHug de Larauze\u5148\u751f\u8bf4\u3002", "note_en": "Back Market, an online marketplace that sells refurbished iPhones and other electronic devices, has raised funding that boosts its valuation to $5.7 billion, leapfrogging what it was worth less than a year ago, according to the company and its investors.\n  Founded in 2014, Back Market fixes and resells electronic goods, including  Apple   and  Samsung smartphones and tablets, MacBook, Dell and  Microsoft laptops, Krups coffee makers and Dyson hair dryers.\n  The company, based in Paris, raised $510 million in its latest funding round. Leading the investment was Sprints Capital, a London-based investment firm that counts online payments company Revolut among its other technology-company holdings.\n  The new $5.7 billion valuation is almost an 80% jump from the $3.2 billion level Back Market achieved in May, when it raised $335 million. The increase underscores the  heady market for startups in Europe, which had previously been seen as an  also-ran in the tech universe.\n      Also joining the investment round were the e-commerce operator\u2019s existing investors, General Atlantic;  Eurazeo  a Paris-based private-equity firm; Agla\u00e9 Ventures, the venture-capital arm of  luxury titan Bernard Arnault; and London\u2019s Generation Investment Management LLP.\n  Back Market, based in Europe, has earmarked the new funds to double the size of its staff in the U.S. to about 100 this year and to boost its total global employee count by 350 to 1,000. It entered the U.S. in 2018 and expects to generate triple-digit annual revenue growth this year, said Thibaud Hug de Larauze, its co-founder and chief executive.\n  Refurbishers and brands sell directly to consumers through Backmarket.com and the company earns a commission on each sale. The company doesn\u2019t disclose financials.\n  The investment is a bet on growing consumer demand for products that reduce electronic waste and offer discounted prices, particularly at a time when inflationary pressures are increasing.\n  \u201cThe sales growth of new electronics and the mounting pressures to divert these devices from landfills creates a massive opportunity for Back Market to win more business,\u201d said Henrik Persson, Sprints\u2019 managing partner.\n  Electronic waste contains toxic additives and hazardous substances such as mercury, yet only 17.4% of 2019\u2019s e-waste was collected and recycled, according to a United Nations report published the following year.\n  Back Market competes with U.S.-based platforms like Swappa and ecoATM International Ltd.\u00a0But unlike some of its competitors, all of its items come directly from certified refurbishers, distributors and brands.\n  The defective rate of devices sold over Back Market\u2019s platform is about 4%, almost on par with the average unofficial rate of new devices, the company says. All purchases come with a contractual warranty that allows buyers to return faulty devices for a full refund.\n  The company hopes refurbished electronics can replicate the  secondhand car market. Refurbished devices represent about 6% of total global annual sales of electronics. By comparison, about 70% of cars purchased are used, Mr. Hug de Larauze said.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 21:25:42", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "iphone,sprints", "title": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5df4\u9ece\u7684\u540e\u671f\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u7ffb\u65b0\u7684iPhone\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u7531Sprints Capital\u4f30\u4ef7\u4e3a510\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4f30\u503c$ 5.7B", "title_en": "Paris-based Back Market, an online marketplace for refurbished iPhones and other devices, raises $510M led by Sprints Capital at a $5.7B valuation", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/refurbished-iphone-seller-back-market-hits-5-7-billion-valuation-11641902402?mod=djemalertNEWS", "via": "", "real_tags": ["iphone", "sprints"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7234b1548bc6464c285924d6228a0cc9.jpg", "infoid": 1072745, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u62e5\u6709Rockstar\u548c2K\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6e38\u620f\u53d1\u884c\u5546\u7684Take-Birtapary\uff0c\u88ab\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e3a\u5728\u4ef7\u503c127\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u534e\u5c14\u8857\u65e5\u62a5\uff09\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u793e\u4ea4\u6e38\u620f\u5f00\u53d1\u5546Zynga\u3002\u73b0\u91d1\u548c\u80a1\u7968\u4ea4\u6613\u9884\u8ba1\u5c06\u4e8e2023\u5e74\u7b2c\u4e00\u5b63\u5ea6\u5173\u95ed\uff0c\u5f85\u76d1\u7ba1\u6279\u51c6\u3002\nTake-2\u7684127\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u6536\u8d2d\u662f\u89c6\u9891\u6e38\u620f\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u6700\u5927\u7684\u6536\u8d2d\u4e4b\u4e00\n\u201c\u5c06Zynga\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u548c\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Zynga\u5728\u5177\u6709Take-Bive\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u4f7f\u6211\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u8fdb\u901a\u8fc7\u6e38\u620f\u8054\u7cfb\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u4f7f\u547d\uff0c\u201dZynga\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u5f17\u5170\u514b\u5409\u6bd4\u8bf4\u3002", "note_en": "Take-Two Interactive, the video game publisher that owns Rockstar and 2K Games, is  set to acquire social game developer Zynga in a deal valued at $12.7 billion (via   The Wall Street Journal).

This has resulted in Ingham\u2019s shipping more whole chickens to supermarkets and other retailers.\n Consumers have reported empty shelves in the chicken sections of supermarkets as shoppers clear out available stock.\n  Ingham\u2019s said its main sites were open and \u201chave not experienced significant on-site transmission of Covid\u201d.\n \u201cHowever, they are experiencing significantly lower levels of staff availability which is impacting production volumes and operational efficiency,\u201d the company said.\n \u201cOperational changes are being made to volume and mix across Ingham\u2019s Australian business and it is not currently possible to predict how long this disruption will continue.\u201d\n A KFC spokesperson said the fast food chain was \u201ccurrently experiencing intermittent supply chain disruptions nationally due to Covid-19 related absenteeism at our chicken suppliers, meaning some of our restaurants are unable to offer our full menu which relies on fresh chicken\u201d.\n \u201cWe\u2019re working with our multiple suppliers to mitigate the impact and provide them with support, but we expect some disruptions to continue in the coming weeks.\u201d\n  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n Ingham\u2019s said it was too early to tell what effect the shortages would have on profit.\n Its managing director, Andrew Reeves, said many employees were \u201cforced to isolate at home due to contracting Covid in the community or as a result of being close contacts\u201d.\n He said a decision by state and federal governments which removed a requirement for asymptomatic close contacts who work in the meat industry to isolate for seven days \u201cshould assist to alleviate some of the current staff shortages\u201d.\n \u201cAs operating conditions begin to stabilise, we expect our production capacity to recover relatively quickly to meet customer and consumer demand.\u201d\n The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, said workers in meatworks were particularly vulnerable to catching Covid-19.\n \u201cThere\u2019s social distancing that\u2019s been put in place but that is not enough with Omicron and inevitably if one person on that line gets sick and is infectious there\u2019s a high chance, especially as we know because of that type of wet, cold environment, for it to spread as well,\u201d she said.\n Eggs, however, are not yet in short supply, with the industry confident that it can handle the disruptions.\n \u201cAny absence of eggs in stores is a result of disruptions to supermarket staffing and logistics, and not a reflection of continuity of supply,\u201d said Rowan McMonnies, managing director of Australian Eggs.\n \u201cAustralia\u2019s 21 million hens are still laying eggs, and farmers are working around the clock to get those eggs to their customers,\u201d he said.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 18:41:11",

"note_en": "TechCrunch in October was the first to report that Brex was raising the capital and had achieved decacorn status. Greenoaks Capital and TCV co-led the financing, which brings the three-year-old San Francisco startup\u2019s total raised to $1.2 billion.\n Brex started its life focused on providing credit cards aimed mainly at startups and SMBs. It has gradually evolved its model with the aim of serving as a one-stop finance shop for these companies. Last April, Brex said it had combined  credit cards, business cash accounts and new spend management and bill pay software \u201ctogether in a single dashboard\u201d as part of   a service  called Brex Premium that cost $49 per month. Today, the company is focused on the corporate card product it\u2019s been building since its inception, banking products and expense management products. Or put more simply, it aims to serve as a \u201cfinancial operating system\u201d for its customers.\n  Its latest raise follows a year that saw a \u201cmore than doubling\u201d of revenue, according to co-CEO and co-founder Henrique  Dubugras , who declined to reveal hard figures. Existing investors made up about  95% of those participating in the Series D-2 round, he added.\n \u201cWe didn\u2019t open up to new ones because we had so many new investors with deep pockets who we\u2019d promised we\u2019d give more allocation to over the years,\u201d  Dubugras  told TechCrunch. \u201cThey were comfortable that we had hit the targets we said we were going to so that gave us some credibility to them.\u201d\n In conjunction with the funding announcement, Brex also announced that it has hired away an exec from Meta:   Karandeep Anand . Anand  has been named the company\u2019s chief product officer after having led  Meta\u2019s business products group, which served more than 200 million businesses globally. Prior to that, Anand spent 15 years at Microsoft, where he led the product management strategy for Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud and developer platform efforts.  The exec will lead Brex\u2019s product portfolio expansion efforts, where a good portion of its new capital will be directed.\n \u201cKarandeep is an engineer by background so he is product and engineering-oriented but also business and customer-oriented,\u201d Dubugras told TechCrunch. \u201cHe\u2019s a unique hire in that sense, and that\u2019s particularly important for Brex. Our software and card touches most of the employees in a company even though it\u2019s the CFO that decides to buy it. Since we want to provide a consumer-like experience, he\u2019s going to help there.\u201d\n   \u201cThe opportunity to create economic opportunity for millions of people and businesses globally through innovation in financial products is incredibly exciting,\u201d he said in a written statement. \u201cThe opportunity ahead for Brex is expansive, and I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity to create products that will help our customers grow their businesses.\u201d\n In terms of customers, Brex continues to serve startups or e-commerce companies that might be smaller businesses but with higher growth. As its earlier customers have grown and matured, Brex is now adapting to also serve mid-market to larger businesses which have different financial needs as they grow. This is where it appears Anand will be able to offer the greatest value.\n  The landscape for startups clamoring to meet companies\u2019 financial needs seems to increase by the day. One of Brex\u2019s most well-known competitors, Ramp, is also growing impressively and  last August, announced it had   raised $300 million  in a Series C round of funding that valued the company at $3.9 billion.  With its move to serve larger and more established companies, Brex seems to only be further encroaching into Ramp\u2019s territory.\n Nell Mehta, founder and managing partner of Greenoaks, believes Brex has been able to build a card that meets the needs of \u201cmodern\u201d businesses and startups. And while that alone was compelling enough to attract his firm\u2019s attention, Greenoaks also saw the broader potential for a \u201ctruly extensible platform that could solve a universal set of problems,\u201d including providing better controls over employee spend, \u201cpainless\u201d expense reporting and rewards tailored to a company\u2019s specific needs.\n \u201cThe result is a differentiated experience that shows up in attractive customer loyalty, and some of the best growth metrics we\u2019d ever seen,\u201d he wrote via email. \u201cOn top of this, we\u2019ve been consistently impressed with Brex\u2019s team, who build excellent products fast, with a profound vision for the future of business banking.\u201d\n Mehta went on to say that Brex has become the \u201ccognitive referent\u201d for modern business banking.

Its data sets \u201clook just as real as a company\u2019s original customer data with just as many details, but without the original personal data points,\u201d the company says.\n Talking to TechCrunch, MOSTLY AI CEO  Tobias Hann said that the company plans to use the proceeds to push the boundaries of what its product can do, grow its team, and gain more customers both in Europe and in the U.S., where it already has offices in New York City.\n  MOSTLY AI was founded in Vienna in 2017, and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was implemented across the EU one year later. This demand for privacy-preserving solutions and the concomitant rise of machine learning have created significant momentum for synthetic data.  Gartner predicts that by 2024, 60% of the data used for the de\u00advel\u00adop\u00adment of AI and an\u00ada\u00adlyt\u00adics projects will be syn\u00adthet\u00adi\u00adcally gen\u00ader\u00adated.\n MOSTLY AI\u2019s typical clients are Fortune 100 banks and insurers, as well as telcos. These three highly regulated sectors drive most of the demand for synthetic tabular data, alongside healthcare.\n Unlike some of its competitors, MOSTLY AI hasn\u2019t put its focus on healthcare in the past, but it could change. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly something that we are watching closely and we are actually starting some pilot projects this year,\u201d the CEO said.\n The democratization of AI means that synthetic data will eventually be used well beyond Fortune 100 companies, Hann told TechCrunch. His company therefore plans to serve smaller organizations and a wider range of sectors in the future. But until now, it made sense for MOSTLY AI to focus on enterprise-level clients.\n  At the moment, enterprise companies are the ones that have the budgets, need and sophistication to work with synthetic data, Hann said. To match their expectations, MOSTLY AI obtained  ISO certifications.\n Talking to Hann, one thing becomes clear: While the startup has a solid technical footing, it is equally invested in the commercialization of its technology and in the business value it can add for its clients. \u201cMOSTLY AI is leading this emerging and rapidly-growing space in terms of both customer deployments and expertise,\u201d Molten Ventures\u2019 investment director Christoph Hornung said.\n The need to comply with privacy laws such as the GDPR and CCPA clearly drives demand for synthetic data, but it\u2019s not the only factor at play. For instance, demand in Europe is also driven by a wider cultural context; while in the U.S., it also results from a desire to innovate. For instance, use cases can include advanced analytics, predictive algorithms, fraud detection and pricing models \u2013 but without data that can be traced back to specific users.\n \u201cMany companies are proactively approaching the space because they understand that customers value privacy,\u201d Hann said. \u201cThese companies understand that they can also gain a competitive advantage when dealing and working with data in a privacy-preserving way.\u201d\n Seeing more U.S. companies wanting to adopt synthetic data in innovative ways is the key reason why MOSTLY AI wants to grow its team in the U.S. But it is also recruiting more generally, both in Vienna and remotely. Its plan is to increase its headcount from 35 to 65 people by the end of the year.\n Hann expects 2022 to be \u201cthe year where synthetic data will take off,\u201d and beyond this year, \u201ca really strong decade for synthetic data.\u201d This will be supported by growing demand for responsible AI, articulated around key concepts such as AI fairness and explainability. Synthetic data helps answer these challenges. \u201cIt enables enterprises to augment and de-bias their data sets,\u201d Hann said.\n Machine learning aside, MOSTLY AI sees lots of potential for synthetic data to be leveraged in software testing. Supporting these use cases requires making synthetic data accessible not only to data scientists, but also to software engineers and quality testers. It\u2019s with them in mind that MOSTLY AI came up a few months ago with version 2.0 of its platform. \u201cMOSTLY AI 2.0 can be implemented on premise or in a private cloud, and adapts to different data structures of the company using it,\u201d the company  wrote at the time.\n \u201cWe are clearly a B2B software infrastructure company,\u201d Hann said. Both in its Series A and B rounds, the company looked for investors who understood that approach.\n Molten Ventures being a  publicly listed VC and consequently not subject to typical funding cycles also carried some weight, Hann confirmed when I asked. \u201cHaving this long term commitment from a partner is something that was very appealing to us, because it\u2019s a little more flexible.\u201d\n It doesn\u2019t hurt either that Citi Ventures is the venture arm of Citigroup, and that it is headquartered in the U.S. \u201cWe\u2019re significantly increasing the team in the U.S., and it\u2019s always great to also have a U.S.-based investor that can help with network and relationships there,\u201d Hann said.\n With $25 million in new funding and an increased U.S. presence, MOSTLY AI will now have more resources to compete against other companies in its segment of the synthetic data space. These include  Tonic.ai, which raised a  $35 million Series B last September;  Gretel AI, which disclosed a  $50 million Series B round last October; and  seed-funded British startup Hazy, as well as players that focus on specific verticals.\n \u201cWe do see more and more players emerging in the space and in the market in general, so it certainly shows that there\u2019s a lot of interest there,\u201d Hann said.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 17:54:28", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u5546\u4e1a,commercialize,\u6570\u636e", "title": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u827e\u90fd\u7b79\u96c6\u4e862500\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5c06\u6b27\u6d32\u548c\u7f8e\u56fd\u5546\u4e1a\u5316\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tMOSTLY AI raises $25 million to further commercialize synthetic data in Europe and the US\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/mostly-ai-raises-25-million-to-further-commercialize-synthetic-data-in-europe-and-the-u-s/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u5546\u4e1a", "\u6570\u636e"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5ca79d6601c52352e2dbfc484139c659.jpg", "infoid": 1072741, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6765\u81eaMozilla\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u7b2c\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0e\u975e\u8425\u5229\u6027\u65b0\u95fb\u5ba4\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u66f4\u591a\u6709\u5173Meta\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002", "note_en": "Rally, the privacy-first data-sharing platform from  Mozilla, will team up with nonprofit newsroom  The Markup on a research project to learn more about Meta\u2019s tracking infrastructure.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 17:27:46", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "facebook,meta,data,\u8ddf\u8e2a", "title": "Mozilla\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u9879\u76ee\u96c6\u4f1a\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u542f\u52a8Facebook Pixel Hunt\uff0c\u4e00\u9879\u8c03\u67e5Meta\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u7814\u7a76", "title_en": "Mozilla's data sharing project Rally and The Markup launch Facebook Pixel Hunt, a study to investigate Meta's data collection and tracking practices", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.adweek.com/media/mozilla-the-markup-team-up-on-a-deep-dive-into-metas-tracking-infrastructure/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["facebook", "meta", "data", "\u8ddf\u8e2a"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "3335c0ebb15fbcbbecc8a6860254c7bb.jpg", "infoid": 1072740, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6b22\u8fce\u6765\u5230\u5976\u916a\u5236\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u524d\u662f\u201cFankhauser\u7684\u5976\u916a\u9875\u201d\u3002\u662f\u7684\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\u6b63\u5728\u8f6c\u6362 - \u6211\u5f88\u6b23\u8d4f\u4f60\u7684\u8010\u5fc3\u3002\n\u5f00\u59cb\u5976\u916a\u4f7f\u60a8\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4e86\u89e3\u6210\u5206\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5976\u916a\u5236\u4f5c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u3002\n\u6211\u6545\u610f\u8bd5\u56fe\u5f00\u53d1\u98df\u8c31\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u98df\u8c31\u5728\u8d85\u5e02\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5bb9\u6613\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6210\u5206\u3002\u8981\u6c42\u7ecf\u7406\u83b7\u5f97\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u8981\u4ece\u4e13\u4e1a\u6765\u6e90\u8d2d\u4e70\uff0c\u8bf7\u67e5\u770b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u516c\u53f8\u3002", "note_en": "Welcome to Cheese Making, formerly \u201cFankhauser\u2019s Cheese Page.\u201d Yes, my site is transitioning\u2013I appreciate your patience.\n Please let me know if you have any difficulty finding something\u2013especially if it is something you have found here before.\u00a0~David Fankhauser\n Beginning Cheese Making\u00a0 takes you to further information on ingredients and equipment along with a link to a syllabus for a beginning cheese making course.\n Here is a pamphlet I put together to accompany my Cheese Making courses:  Make Your Own Cheese, A Workshop on Cheese Making..\n                                   I have purposely tried to develop recipes which use ingredients easily found locally in supermarkets.

Although the parliament has avoided a financial penalty this time.\n The European Data Protection Supervisor\u2019s (EDPS) intervention relates to a COVID-19 test booking website which the European Parliament launched in September 2020 \u2014 using a third party provider, called Ecolog.\n  The website attracted a number of  complaints, filed by six MEPs, last year \u2014 with the support of the European privacy campaign group  noyb \u2014 over the presence of third party trackers and confusing cookie consent banners, among a raft of other compliance problems which also included transparency and data access issues.\n Following an investigation, the EDPS  found the parliament was at fault in several respects and it has issued a reprimand \u2014 ordering rectification of any outstanding issues within one month.\n The test booking website was found to be dropping cookies associated with Google Analytics and Stripe \u2014 but the parliament failed to demonstrate it had applied any special measures to ensure that any associated personal data transfers to the US would be adequately protected in light of the landmark Schrems II decision by the EU\u2019s top court.\n In July 2020, the CJEU struck down the bloc\u2019s flagship data transfer agreement with the US (aka, the EU-US Privacy Shield) and issued further guidance that transfers of EU people\u2019s personal data to all third countries must be risk assessed on a case by case basis.\n  The ruling also made it clear that EU regulators must step in and suspend data flows if they believe people\u2019s information is at risk. So in order for some transfers to be legal (such as EU-US data flows) additional measures may be needed to raise the level of protection to the required standard of essential equivalence with EU law \u2014 something the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has  since issued  detailed guidance on.\n  However \u2014 in the case of the parliament\u2019s COVID-19 test booking site \u2014 the EDPS found no evidence that it or its provider had applied any such extra measures to safeguard EU-US transfers resulting from the inclusion of Google Analytics and Stripe cookies.\n Turns out the provider had copypasted code from another website it had built, for a test centre in the Brussels International Airport \u2014 hence the presence of cookies for payment company Stripe on the parliament site (despite no payments actually being required for testing booked via the website).\n Google Analytics cookies, meanwhile, had apparently been included by the provider to \u201cminimise the risk of spoofing and for website optimisation purposes\u201d, according to the EDPS\u2019 findings.\n Post- Schrems II, the presence of cookies designed to send data to US-based providers for processing creates immediate legal risk for EU-based websites \u2014 and/or their clients (in this case the parliament was found by the EDPS to be the sole data controller, while Ecolog was the data processor). So incorporating Google Analytics may do the opposite of \u2018optimizing\u2019 your site\u2019s compliance with EU data protection law.\n That said, enforcement of this particular compliance issue has been a slow burn, even since the 2020 CJEU ruling \u2014 with only a smattering of regulator-led investigations, and the  clearest leadership coming from the EDPS itself.\n A (very) long running complaint against Facebook\u2019s EU-US data transfers, meanwhile, brought by noyb founder Max Schrems in the wake of the 2013 Snowden disclosures about NSA mass surveillance of social network and Internet data, still hasn\u2019t resulted in a final decision by its lead data protection supervisor, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) \u2014 despite the latter agreeing   a full year ago that it would \u201cswiftly\u201d finalize the complaint.\n Again, though, that makes the EDPS\u2019 intervention on the parliament complaint all the more significant. tl;dr: EU banhammers are, gradually, falling.\n  In another finding against the parliament, the EDPS took issue with confusing cookie consent notices shown to visitors to the test booking website \u2014 which it found provided inaccurate information; did not always offer clear choices to reject third party tracking; and included deceptive design which could manipulate consent.\n By contrast, EU law on consent as a legal basis to process people\u2019s data requires is clear that choice must be informed, specific (i.e. purpose limited, rather than bundled) and freely given.\n The parliament was also found to have failed to respond adequately to complainants requests for information \u2014 breaching additional legal requirements law which provide Europeans with a suite of access rights related to their personal data.\n While the parliament has landed in the embarrassing situation of being reprimanded by the EDPS, it has avoided a fine \u2014 as the regulator only has narrow powers to issue financial penalties which it said these infringements did not trigger.\n But the findings of fault by the bloc\u2019s chief data protection supervisor draw fresh red lines around routine regional use of US-based tools like Google Analytics (or, indeed,  Facebook Pages) in the wake of the  Schrems II decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n Copypasting code with standard analytics calls might seem like a quick win to a website builder \u2014 but not if the entity responsible for safeguarding visitors\u2019 information fails to properly assess EU-based legal risk.\n The EDPS\u2019 reprimand for the parliament thus has wider significant as it looks likely to prefigure a wave of aligned decisions by EU regulators, given the  scores of similar complaints filed by noyb in August 2020 targeting websites across the bloc.\n \u201cWe expect more rulings on this matter in the next month,\u201d noyb\u2019s honorary chairman, Max Schrems, told TechCrunch. \u201cThe fact that the EDPS has taken a clear position is a good sign for other DPAs.\u201d\n The EDPS\u2019 sanction of the parliament over confusing cookie banners also sends a strong signal over what\u2019s acceptable and what\u2019s not when it comes to obtaining users\u2019 consent to tracking \u2014 despite confusing dark patterns still being shamefully widespread in the EU.\n (For a particularly ironic example of that, see this  blog post by analyst Forrester \u2014 which warns that regulators are coming for \u201cdark patterns\u201d, even as the analyst\u2019s own webpage serves what very much looks like a non-compliant cookie notice given the only obvious button reads \u201cAccept cookies\u201d and it takes multiple clicks through sub-menus to find an option to reject tracking cookies, so er\u2026 )\n noyb also kicked off  a major effort targeting this type of cookie non-compliance last year \u2014 which it suggested could lead to it filing up to 10,000 complaints about dubious cookie banners with EU regulators.\n Regional regulators are clearly going to have their work cut out to clean up so much infringement \u2014 which in turn may encourage DPAs to coordinate on standardizing enforcements to drive the necessary scale of change.\n The EDPS decision adds high level accelerant by sending a clear signal that confusing cookie banners are the same as non-compliant cookie banners from the body responsible for providing EU lawmakers with expert guidance on how to interpret and apply data protection law.\n Here\u2019s an illustrative snippet from its decision \u2014 which describes a portion of the confusion that hit visitors to the parliament website as they tried to parse the cookie notices at the time of the complaints (tracking cookies have since been removed from the site):\n \u201cThe English version only referred to essential cookies and prompted the user to either click on the \u2018accept all\u2019 or the \u2018save\u2019 button. The difference between the two buttons was unclear. The French version of the second layer of cookie banner referred both to essential cookies and \u2018external media\u2019. These external media cookies included cookies from Facebook, Google Maps, Instagram, OpenStreetMap, Twitter, Vimeo and Youtube. The visitor could also choose between \u2018accept all\u2019 or \u2018save\u2019. The German version of the second layer of the cookie banner referred to only one \u2018external media\u2019 cookie \u2014 Google Maps \u2014 in addition to the essential cookie.\u201d\n The EDPS\u2019 conclusion was that the cookie banners in all three languages failed to meet the EU standard for consent.\n In another sign of the cookie (non)compliance reckoning that\u2019s now unfolding in the region, some EU regulators have been taking actual action \u2014 such as France\u2019s CNIL which issued a  major slap-down to Google and Facebook last week, announcing fines of $170M and $68M respectively for choosing dark pattern design over clear choices in their cookie consent flows.\n The EDPB, which supports DPAs\u2019 enforcement of pan-EU rules like the General Data Protection Regulation, established a task force on the cookie issue  last fall \u2014 saying it would \u201ccoordinate the response to complaints concerning cookie banners\u201d noyb had filed with a number of regional agencies.\n Schrems describes that step as a \u201cgood\u201d development \u2014 but said it is also slowing things down.\n Although he suggested the direction of travel is toward a standard that will require a simple yes/no for tracking.

For example, developers, who pay 15% for transactions through Google Play\u2019s billing system, would pay 11% through Google\u2019s alternative billing system.\n  Meanwhile, Apple\u2019s top executive in South Korea, Brandon Yoon, who was in charge of the app store system, abruptly left the iPhone maker in early November. According to media reports, Yoon\u2019s leave is not related to the alternative app payment system.\n  In late August 2021, the South Korean parliament  has passed the world\u2019s first bill to prevent the global tech giants from forcing developers to use their in-app billing systems.\n \u201cWe look forward to working with the KCC and our developer community on a solution that benefits our Korean users,\u201d a spokesperson at Apple said.\n Apple said in its statement that the number of app developers operating in South Korea has increased to approximately 580,000, with more than 1.4 million apps available on the Korean App Store since 2008. Through its App Store, Apple has helped Korean developers access markets and customers in nearly 200 countries around the world, the company said.\n \u201cApple has a great deal of respect for Korea\u2019s laws and a strong history of collaboration with the country\u2019s talented app developers. Our work will always be guided by keeping the App Store a safe and trusted place for our users to download the apps they love,\u201d the spokesperson said.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 15:58:27", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "apple,\u5141\u8bb8,party,\u97e9\u56fd", "title": "Apple\u5141\u8bb8\u97e9\u56fd\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u5e94\u7528\u4ed8\u6b3e\u9009\u9879", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tApple to allow third party app payment options in South Korea\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/apple-to-allow-third-party-app-payment-options-in-south-korea/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["apple", "\u5141\u8bb8", "party", "\u97e9\u56fd"]}]
