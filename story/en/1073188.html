D: To Do list E: Beginning of notes for first meeting.    I&#39;ve developed a fairly consistent daily routine for using Proteus:  I begin by going to the page of the day.  I update the To Do list at the top of the page (usually, the To Do list for that day has already been started).  I switch out of Proteus and check my email and calendar. This may result in further additions to the To Do list. Email that has content that I want to save or that I want to reflect on and answer later, may be pasted into the content area.  As the day goes on I usually have Proteus near at hand. I will use Proteus to update my To Do list, to jot brief notes (e.g. telephone messages; thoughts), and to compose and send email. When in meetings, I will usually make notes in Proteus; if the meeting is fairly large and is covering matters that don&#39;t concern me, I&#39;ll make notes on other things, update my To Do list, or do email, while monitoring what&#39;s going on in the meeting.</p><p>图4。内容页的详细信息：a：章节和小节标题。B：页码日期（仅限每日注释部分）。C：第一行目录字段（出现在目录中）。D：待办事项清单E：第一次会议笔记的开始。我&#39；我已经为使用Proteus制定了一个相当一致的日常程序：我从每天的页面开始。我更新页面顶部的待办事项列表（通常，当天的待办事项列表已经开始）。我关掉Proteus，查看我的电子邮件和日历。这可能会进一步增加待办事项列表。如果电子邮件中有我想保存的内容，或者我想稍后反思和回复的内容，则可以将其粘贴到内容区域。随着时间的推移，我身边通常都有普罗特斯。我将使用Proteus更新我的待办事项列表，记下简短的笔记（如电话留言、想法），并撰写和发送电子邮件。开会时，我通常会用Proteus做笔记；如果会议规模相当大，涉及的事项不符合&#39；别担心我，我&#39；我会记下其他事情，更新我的待办事项清单，或发电子邮件，同时监控什么&#39；会议正在进行中。</p><p> So, in summary, frequent uses of Proteus (ranging from once or twice a week to many times a day) include:</p><p>因此，总的来说，频繁使用Proteus（从一周一次或两次到一天多次）包括：</p><p>   I use Proteus for a number of other tasks, although their frequency is in the range of from once a week to once a month.

I use the search command to search through Proteus for information several times a month- occasionally a particular quotation from something I&#39;ve read, more often notes from a particular meeting.  Summarization. Once a month I do a report on my activities; this involves browsing the last month&#39;s worth of Proteus entries. Occasionally, I need to produce a summary of the results of a series of meetings, and will search for notes relevant to particular projects.  Diagramming. A couple times a month I will use Proteus to draw diagrams or models relevant to meetings or projects in which I&#39;m evolved. (This is a completely unanticipated use: I hadn&#39;t imagined that anyone-let alone me-would want to draw with a track ball!)  Capturing Reading Notes. If I read something useful, I&#39;ll often transcribe quotations from it into a special section of Proteus. This activity occurs in bursts-with several months intervening between bursts.</p><p>参考我每个月都会使用search命令在Proteus中搜索好几次信息，偶尔也会从我&#39；我经常读某个会议的笔记。总结。我每个月做一次活动报告；这包括浏览上个月&#39；这是相当于普罗特斯作品的价值。偶尔，我需要对一系列会议的结果进行总结，并搜索与特定项目相关的笔记。图解。每月有几次，我会使用Proteus绘制与会议或项目相关的图表或模型，我&#39；我进化了。（这是一个完全出乎意料的用途：我&#39；没有想到，除了我之外，任何人都想用一个轨迹球来画画！）捕捉阅读笔记。如果我读到有用的东西，我&#39；我经常把它的语录转录到普罗特斯的一个特别章节里。这种活动以爆发的形式发生，爆发之间有几个月的间隔。</p><p>  It is interesting to note that I do not use Proteus in the way I originally thought I would. The motivation behind transforming Proteus from a stack of quotations into a full-featured electronic notebook was the vision of being able to make notes for a paper, and link the notes to the relevant quotations. However, after finishing the work of programming Proteus, I quickly abandoned this use. I found that jumping to the quotations caused a disruptive context shift, and that the functionality provided by HyperCard text fields was insufficient. What I really wanted (and soon switched to) was an outliner into which I could copy my quotations, and where I could interleave them with notes and writing fragments. In general, I do not use Proteus to author structured documents.</p><p>有趣的是，我并没有像我最初认为的那样使用Proteus。将Proteus从一堆引文转换成一个功能齐全的电子笔记本的动机是能够为一篇论文做笔记，并将笔记与相关引文联系起来。然而，在完成Proteus的编程工作后，我很快放弃了这个用途。我发现跳转到引号会导致中断性的上下文转换，而HyperCard文本字段提供的功能是不够的。我真正想要（并很快转向）的是一个大纲视图，我可以在其中复制我的引文，并在其中插入笔记和写作片段。一般来说，我不使用Proteus编写结构化文档。</p><p>  Before Proteus I was a heavy user of paper notebooks. As with Proteus, I used paper notebooks as a sort of work diary: I started each day on a new page, kept a To Do list, meeting notes, and used it as a repository for other information. However, there are couple of striking differences (besides the obvious one that I didn&#39;t use it for composing email). First, I find that I make many more notes in Proteus-in part this is because I find typing easier and faster than writing, and in part because of synergetic effects I describe in the next section. Second, I rarely looked back through my paper notebooks-and when I did, I only tended to look at recent entries. In contrast, I re-read entries in Proteus frequently. There are several reasons for this: it is easier to search and browse; the content is more legible; and when I find something useful it can be copied and re-used.</p><p>在普罗特斯之前，我是纸质笔记本的忠实用户。和Proteus一样，我使用纸质笔记本作为一种工作日记：我每天从一个新的页面开始，保留待办事项清单、会议记录，并将其用作其他信息的存储库。然而，有两个显著的区别（除了一个明显的区别，我没有用它来写电子邮件）。首先，我发现我在Proteus中做了更多笔记，部分原因是我发现打字比写作更容易、更快，部分原因是我在下一节中描述的协同效应。其次，我很少翻阅纸质笔记本，当我翻阅时，我只倾向于查看最近的条目。相比之下，我经常重读Proteus中的条目。这有几个原因：搜索和浏览更容易；内容更清晰；当我发现有用的东西时，它可以被复制和重复使用。</p><p>   Although there are many ways in which Proteus is quite useful, two are so important as to make it an essential part of my work activity.</p><p>虽然Proteus在很多方面都很有用，但有两种方法非常重要，使其成为我工作活动的重要组成部分。</p><p>  Probably the most significant impact of Proteus is a sort of synergy among the activities of note making, reference, and messaging. Messaging drives this synergy. I write notes more often-and my notes are of higher quality-because I know that I am more likely to email them to others. Because the quality of my notes is higher, I reference (and reuse) them more when I&#39;m writing a relevant message or paper. Also, the increased quality means that I am more likely to understand them when I look back at them after six months. In turn, the increased frequency of reference also drives note making and messaging: the more use I get out of them, the more effort I&#39;m willing to put into them. Thus, there is a curious sort of ambiguity when writing in Proteus: my proximate goal may be keeping notes on an interesting meeting, but I also know in the back of my mind that they may also turn into a message or serve as grist for a future paper.</p><p>Proteus最重要的影响可能是在笔记、参考和信息传递活动之间的协同作用。信息传递推动了这种协同效应。我更频繁地写笔记，我的笔记质量也更高，因为我知道我更有可能通过电子邮件将它们发送给他人。因为我笔记的质量更高，所以当我&#39；我正在写一条相关的信息或论文。此外，质量的提高意味着，当我在六个月后回顾它们时，我更有可能理解它们。反过来，参考频率的增加也推动了记笔记和发信息：我从中得到的利用越多，我就越努力；我愿意投入其中。因此，在用Proteus写作时，有一种奇怪的模糊性：我的近期目标可能是记录一次有趣的会议，但我也知道在我的脑海深处，它们也可能会变成一条信息，或成为未来论文的素材。</p><p>  The other major aspect of Proteus&#39; usefulness has to do with its portability, and with the amount of personally relevant information in it. I typically carry Proteus with me and so I always have a variety of tasks of various sizes that I can work on. If I arrive at a meeting early, I can compose a message, review notes, or update my To Do list while waiting for others to arrive.     This has changed my behavior. I am more willing to go to large meetings where some or all of the content is of unknown relevance: if the meeting is relevant, I pay attention and take notes; if parts are irrelevant, I can work on other things while keeping half an ear on the meeting. I have had extremely productive work sessions when &#39;stuck&#39; in the middle of a row in the auditorium. While this may sound like a small thing, the degree to which it alleviates irritation at late-starting meetings, and anxiety about being stuck in irrelevant meetings, makes a significant difference in my life.</p><p>变形菌的另一个主要方面是#39；有用性与它的可移植性以及其中与个人相关的信息量有关。我通常随身携带Proteus，因此我总是有各种大小的任务可以完成。如果我提前到达会议地点，我可以在等待其他人到达时撰写信息、查看笔记或更新我的待办事项列表。这改变了我的行为。我更愿意参加一些或所有内容都未知相关的大型会议：如果会议相关，我会注意并做笔记；如果部分内容不相关，我可以在会议上保持半个耳朵的同时处理其他事情。我在&#39；卡住&#39；在礼堂中间排成一排。虽然这听起来像是一件小事，但它在多大程度上缓解了晚开始开会时的恼怒，以及被困在无关会议上的焦虑，这对我的生活产生了重大影响。</p><p>  Although note making, messaging, and activity management are the primary uses of Proteus, information storage and retrieval plays an important role in supporting these tasks, as well as being useful independently. Proteus supports a variety of ways of searching for things. One can use text search, browse using the section and subsection TOCs, or search for items that have been specially marked in various ways.</p><p>虽然Proteus的主要用途是做笔记、发消息和进行活动管理，但信息存储和检索在支持这些任务方面发挥着重要作用，并且独立发挥作用。Proteus支持多种搜索方式。用户可以使用文本搜索、使用章节和小节目录进行浏览，或者搜索以各种方式进行了特殊标记的项目。</p><p>  One of the putative benefits of an electronic notebook is that you can use text search. This is not as useful as it might seem. There are three problems: First, a fact of life for me, and I suspect for most electronic notebook users, is that notes are written hastily, and hence contain frequent misspellings, typos, and abbreviations. Thus, standard keyword searches are not very effective in finding words which have been mistyped or hastily abbreviated. Second, I use many words much more frequently than I&#39;m aware of. Words like object, metaphor, interface, and communications are so frequent as to not be worth searching for, as are common project names. In this respect the use of To Do lists is a drawback, as important projects and items tend to recur in To Do lists and generate hit after hit when searching. Finally, the limitations of HyperCard&#39;s search mechanism (it takes you to the card, and shows only the first word of the first instance that matches) exacerbates the above problems. A search mechanism that would generate a list of fuzzy hits (so that when searching for PowerTalk, you&#39;d also get PowerTlk, and PwerTalk), shown with surrounding context, would be far more useful.    As a consequence of this, text search in Proteus is primarily useful when: 1) trying to put together a summary of what has happened on a project (i.e., many hits are just what you want); 2) when searching for a relatively unique target that is probably spelled correctly (e.g., part of an email address string such as &#34;boombox&#34;; or 3) when the approximate location of the item is known, so that the search can be limited to that neighborhood.</p><p>电子笔记本的一个假定好处是，你可以使用文本搜索。这并不像看上去那么有用。这里有三个问题：首先，我的一个生活事实是，笔记写得很匆忙，因此经常出现拼写错误、打字错误和缩写，我怀疑这对大多数电子笔记本用户来说也是如此。因此，标准的关键字搜索在查找输入错误或匆忙缩写的单词时不是很有效。第二，我比我更频繁地使用很多单词&#39；我知道。像对象、隐喻、接口和通信这样的词如此频繁，以至于不值得搜索，常见的项目名称也是如此。在这方面，使用待办事项列表是一个缺点，因为重要的项目和项目往往会在待办事项列表中重复出现，并在搜索时产生一次又一次的点击。最后是HyperCard的局限性&#39；s的搜索机制（它将你带到卡片，只显示第一个匹配实例的第一个单词）加剧了上述问题。一种搜索机制会生成模糊点击列表（这样在搜索PowerTalk时，你也会得到PowerTlk和PwerTalk），并与周围的上下文一起显示，这将非常有用。因此，Proteus中的文本搜索主要在以下情况下有用：1）试图汇总项目中发生的事情（即，许多点击正是您想要的）；2） 在搜索可能拼写正确的相对唯一的目标（例如，电子邮件地址字符串的一部分，如&#34；boombox&#34；或3）时，已知项目的大致位置，以便将搜索限制在该社区。</p><p>  A second strategy for finding is to mark things when you think you may want to find them later. Proteus provides two mechanisms for this: stamps and dog-ears. A stamp is a way of providing a sort of topic-specific book mark- Proteus had stamps for addresses, reference citations, and &#39;interesting items.&#39; The user can select a type of stamp and can then jump from one stamp to the next. Dog-ears are similar to stamps except a bit simpler: they are the analog of folding over the corner of a page. Like stamps, the user can jump from one dog-ear to the next.    I use dog-ears several times a month; however, I rarely use stamps. One reason for this has to do with overhead. While stamps are easy to use, requiring no more than a click to stamp something, if I&#39;m engaged in my current activity I don&#39;t think about the desirability of stamping the item, or if I do, I often don&#39;t want to interrupt my flow of activity. If I do decide to interrupt myself, I still tend not to use stamps. Stamps are primarily a way of deferring actions until later: I stamp addresses so I can enter them in my address file; I stamp citations so I can put those in a special place; and so on. If I decide to interrupt my activity, I typically just go ahead and do the whole thing.     However, this doesn&#39;t explain why dog-ears are used so much more frequently than stamps, since they are logically and functionally equivalent, both requiring a click to create, and both requiring clicking a button to search for. I believe that the explanation is that stamping something seems to require more cognitive overhead. In stamping something, the user is basically making the decision to apply a particular label to a particular piece of content. In contrast, marking a page with a dog-ear is simply saying &#39;I may want to look at something on this page again.&#39; Dog-ears are more light weight than stamps.</p><p>寻找的第二个策略是，当你认为以后可能想找到它们时，标记它们。Proteus提供了两种机制：邮票和狗耳朵。邮票是一种提供特定主题图书标记的方式——Proteus有地址、参考文献和&#39的邮票；有趣的东西&#39; 用户可以选择一种类型的戳记，然后可以从一个戳记跳到下一个戳记。狗耳朵与邮票相似，只是有点简单：它们类似于折叠一页的一角。就像邮票一样，用户可以从一只狗耳朵跳到下一只狗耳朵。我一个月用几次狗耳朵；然而，我很少使用邮票。其中一个原因与开销有关。虽然邮票很容易使用，只需要点击一下就可以在某物上盖章，如果我&#39；我正在从事我目前不喜欢的活动&#39；don’不要考虑在物品上盖章的可取性，或者如果我这样做了，我通常不会&#39；我不想打断我的活动。如果我决定打断自己，我仍然倾向于不使用邮票。盖章主要是将行动推迟到以后的一种方式：我在地址上盖章，以便在地址文件中输入地址；我在引文上盖章，这样我就可以把它们放在一个特殊的地方；等等如果我决定打断我的活动，我通常会继续做整件事。然而，这并不意味着&#39；我无法解释为什么狗耳朵的使用频率比邮票高出很多，因为它们在逻辑和功能上都是等价的，既需要点击创建，也需要点击按钮搜索。我认为原因在于，在某些东西上盖章似乎需要更多的认知开销。在加盖标签时，用户基本上是在决定将特定标签应用于特定内容。相比之下，用狗耳朵标记页面只不过是说&#39；我可能想再看看这一页上的内容&#39; 狗耳朵比邮票更轻。</p><p>  Proteus succeeds best at search by browsing. That is, a common strategy for finding something-if its approximate location is known-is to browse the appropriate table of contents. I may recognize what I&#39;m searching for, and can then jump directly to it. Or I may see something which reminds me of the context, and thus generates more cues about what I&#39;m searching for. The decision to include the first line of each content page in the subsection TOCs turned out to be a good one.     (Of course, it should be noted that TOCs were not designed with this use in mind. TOCs evolved in the context of the original quotations stack (see next subsection), and the idea of using the first line of each page was derived from an analogy to the indices of poetry and quotation anthologies.)</p><p>Proteus最擅长通过浏览进行搜索。也就是说，如果某个东西的大致位置已知，那么找到它的一个常见策略就是浏览相应的目录。我可能认识我&#39；我正在搜索，然后可以直接跳到它。或者我可能会看到一些让我想起上下文的东西，从而产生更多关于我&#39；我在寻找。将每个内容页的第一行包含在TOC小节中的决定被证明是一个好的决定。（当然，应该注意的是，TOC的设计并没有考虑到这一用途。TOC是在原始引文堆栈的背景下发展起来的（见下一小节），使用每页第一行的想法源自对诗歌和引文选集索引的类比。）</p><p>  One interesting facet of Proteus is that it has changed considerably over time, both in terms of its underlying structure and function, and in how it was used.</p><p>Proteus一个有趣的方面是，随着时间的推移，它的基本结构和功能以及使用方式都发生了很大的变化。</p><p>  Proteus did not spring into existence as an electronic notebook, or as a vehicle for exploring issues about customization and long term usefulness. Rather, it went through a gradual evolution.    Proteus began as a stack of quotations and notes (my practice is to copy down quotes from favorite books or articles). After a year or so, I had enough entries that using them became cumbersome, and so I added a table of contents that could be recompiled when new quotations were added. As more cards were added it became desirable to break it into subsections and to have a hierarchical table of contents.     About this time, I realized that with &#39;just a little more work&#39; I could have an electronic notebook that would allow me to explore on a personal level some of the frustrating issues already described. I also had a concrete task in mind for Proteus: I had been wanting to write a paper that drew upon a number of the quotations I had collected in the stack, and I thought it would be very useful to be able to outline the paper, and link parts of it to relevant quotations.</p><p>Proteus并不是作为一个电子笔记本，也不是一个探索定制和长期实用性问题的工具而诞生的。相反，它经历了一个渐进的演变。Proteus最初是一堆引语和注释（我的做法是从最喜欢的书或文章中抄录引语）。大约一年后，我有了足够多的条目，使用它们变得很麻烦，所以我添加了一个目录，可以在添加新的引用时重新编译。随着越来越多的卡片被添加进来，人们希望把它分成几个小节，并有一个分级目录。大约在这个时候，我意识到&#39；再多做一点工作&#39；我可以有一个电子笔记本，可以让我在个人层面上探索一些已经描述过的令人沮丧的问题。对于普罗特斯，我心里也有一个具体的任务：我一直想写一篇论文，引用我在书堆中收集的一些引文，我认为能够概述这篇论文，并将部分内容与相关引文联系起来会非常有用。</p><p>  Personal electronic notebooks have a paradoxical aspect to them: they really don&#39;t become useful until considerable material has been entered, and yet how many people will exert the effort needed to enter material, before the utility is evident? I call this the start up problem. While it is dangerous to generalize from a population of one, the case of Proteus suggests an interesting answer to the start up problem.    Initially, Proteus tried to solve the start up problem by cheating, in that it began with a large number of quotations that had been gradually built up over a couple of years. However, this failed, in that the initially envisioned authoring/linking use for Proteus didn&#39;t pan out: it was too cumbersome. Instead, what saved Proteus from being abandoned was its use as a diary, and that in turn was driven by the incorporation of messaging functionality. Messaging added collaborative value to the note making functionality of Proteus, and permitted it to be useful (and encouraged the entry of information), until there was enough information to make Proteus useful for reference purposes.     (As in the case of TOCs, the full importance of messaging was not anticipated. Messaging was originally incorporated in Proteus only because it was easy to add. I already had an X-command and script for messaging that I had used in another stack, the electronic edition of a newsletter I edit. Ironically, messaging was a failure in that context; fewer than a dozen people ever made use of it.)</p><p>个人电子笔记本有一个自相矛盾的方面：它们真的没有&#39；在大量材料被输入之前，你不会变得有用。然而，在效用显而易见之前，有多少人会努力输入材料？我称之为启动问题。虽然从一个人的群体中进行概括是危险的，但Proteus的案例为创业问题提供了一个有趣的答案。最初，普罗特斯试图通过作弊来解决创业问题，因为它始于大量的引文，这些引文是在几年内逐渐建立起来的。然而，这失败了，因为最初设想的Proteus的创作/链接用途没有&#39；t pan out:太麻烦了。取而代之的是，Proteus之所以没有被抛弃，是因为它被用作日记，而这反过来又是由信息功能的结合推动的。信息传递为Proteus的笔记功能增加了协作价值，并使其变得有用（并鼓励输入信息），直到有足够的信息使Proteus可用于参考目的。（就像TOC的情况一样，信息传递的全部重要性是没有预料到的。信息传递最初被纳入Proteus只是因为它很容易添加。我已经有了一个X命令和用于信息传递的脚本，我在另一个堆栈中使用了它，我编辑的一份时事通讯的电子版。具有讽刺意味的是，在这种情况下，信息传递是一个失败；fe至少有十几个人使用过它。）</p><p>  When working on the predecessor to Proteus (the original, working prototype of an electronic notebook), I had a running debate with another designer over how much structure people wanted in an electronic notebook. What I wanted, I claimed, was something very simple: just a temporally-ordered set of pages. People remember things by time, I said, and if you allow them to move pages around, and create sections, they&#39;ll just start losing things, and we&#39;ll have to introduce all sorts of functionality for organizing and navigating the notebook.    As Proteus evolved, it quickly became apparent that I was wrong. While I don&#39;t find it surprising when my intuitions about what other people want are wrong, I was surprised to discover that my intuitions about what I wanted were wrong. But it&#39;s incontestable. The most obvious trend in the evolution of Proteus is the gradual addition of more and more layers of structure. Proteus started out as one notebook; after a bit it was broken into sections, each with their own table of contents. After a bit longer subsections and subsection TOCs were added. And finally major sections of the notebooks were broken apart into separate notebooks which can be accessed through a bookshelf menu.    At the same time, it is important to note that at the beginning I neither wanted nor needed the structure. It was only as time went on, and I added more and more information, and begin to develop specialized ways of interacting with it, that the increased structure became useful for supporting access and browsing, and for segregating functionality.</p><p>在制作Proteus的前身（电子笔记本的原始工作原型）时，我与另一位设计师就人们希望电子笔记本有多大的结构展开了持续的辩论。我声称，我想要的是非常简单的东西：只是一套按时间顺序排列的页面。人们会按时间记住事情，我说，如果你允许他们移动页面，创建分区，他们&#39；我们只是开始失去一些东西，而我们&#39；I’我必须引入各种各样的功能来组织和导航笔记本电脑。随着普罗特斯的进化，很快就发现我错了。而我没有&#39；当我对别人想要什么的直觉是错误的时，我并不感到惊讶，我惊讶地发现我对自己想要什么的直觉是错误的。但它&#39；这是无可争辩的。变形菌进化过程中最明显的趋势是逐渐增加越来越多的结构层。普罗特斯最初只是一个笔记本；过了一会儿，它被分成了几个部分，每个部分都有自己的目录。在稍长一点之后，增加了小节和小节TOC。最后，笔记本的主要部分被拆分成单独的笔记本，可以通过书架菜单访问。同时，重要的是要注意，一开始我既不想要也不需要这种结构。只是随着时间的推移，我添加了越来越多的信息，并开始开发与之交互的专门方式，这种增加的结构才变得有用，可以支持访问和浏览，以及隔离功能。</p><p>  This brings us to the next trend in the evolution of Proteus: the increasing degree of task-specific specialization. As I began using Proteus in new ways, after a while I would develop functionality that support the new mode of use. For example, the use of Proteus as a diary started out fairly simply: text was simply entered onto a blank, unspecialized content page. But as time went on I developed various conventions, and then eventually implemented functionality to support and reinforce those conventions. Some instances:</p><p>这给我们带来了变形菌进化的下一个趋势：任务特定专业化程度的增加。当我开始以新的方式使用Proteus时，过了一段时间，我会开发支持新使用模式的功能。例如，将Proteus用作日记一开始就相当简单：文本只需输入一个空白的非专业内容页面。但随着时间的推移，我开发了各种约定，然后最终实现了支持和加强这些约定的功能。一些例子：</p><p> The diary page begins with the date. Initially the date was entered manually. After a while, I created a &#34;header&#34; button to automatically generate the date for the day. As of this writing, the working notebook for a new year is generated, with the diary pages having the date embedded in them.  As the To Do list became more heavily used, buttons that supported particular operations on it appeared (e.g., a &#39;procrastinate button&#39;, that moves selected To Do items to tomorrow&#39;s page; a &#39;to do button&#39; that copies selected text (usually from notes), and inserts it in the To Do list.)  A convention of separating different items with dashes was codified with the &#34;---&#34; button, which automatically drew a line of dashes.</p><p>日记页以日期开始。最初，日期是手动输入的。过了一会儿，我创造了一个&#34；标题&#34；按钮自动生成当天的日期。在写这篇文章时，新的一年的工作笔记本已经生成，日记页面中嵌入了日期。随着待办事项列表的使用越来越频繁，支持其特定操作的按钮出现了（例如，一个&#39；拖延按钮&#39；，它将选定的待办事项移动到明天的页面；一个&#39；待办事项按钮&#39；它复制选定的文本（通常来自注释），并将其插入待办事项列表。）一个用破折号分隔不同项目的惯例是用&#34---&#34; 按钮，它会自动绘制一条虚线。</p><p> These are all minor things. However, they do use up significant amounts of the limited space for controls, and contribute to the transformation of pages in the &#34;daily notes&#34; section from generic content pages to diary-specific pages. The appearance of task-specific controls also increased the pressure to split off the diary portion of the notebook into its own notebook. Perhaps most importantly, the appearance of task-specific functionality resulted in new structural features of the notebook which could then be used to support the development of more task-specific functionality. For example, once the &#34;---&#34; button for separating items was implemented, it was easy to create a button to jump from one item to the next because the system could tell that a new item was marked by the appearance of a particular number of dashes; prior to that, when dashed separators were generated manually and might have any number of dashes, the task of writing a script to distinguish separators from other uses of dashes was more work than seemed justified.    Similar stories can be told about other uses of Proteus. The quotation reference section of Proteus became more specialized, and was split off into its own notebook. A section of Proteus that started out to support scheduling, gradually became more complex and specialized, until it was replaced with links to an external, calendar application. The global Table of Contents began as a regular TOC (as in figure 3), and only gradually developed the browser-like structure shown in figure 2. Again and again there was a move from generality and simplicity towards specialization and complexity. And while there are many instances of periods of simplification (e.g., the removal of unused functionality), these simplifications were often triggered by the desire to make room for new functionality.</p><p>这些都是小事。然而，它们确实占用了大量有限的控制空间，并有助于&#34；每日笔记&#34；从一般内容页到特定于日记的页面。任务特定控件的出现也增加了将笔记本的日记部分拆分为自己的笔记本的压力。也许最重要的是，特定于任务的功能的出现导致了笔记本电脑的新结构特征，这些特征可以用来支持开发更多特定于任务的功能。例如，一旦&#34---&#34; 实现了用于分隔项目的按钮，很容易创建一个从一个项目跳到下一个项目的按钮，因为系统可以判断一个新项目是由特定数量的破折号标记的；在此之前，当虚线分隔符是手动生成的，并且可能有任意数量的破折号时，编写脚本以将分隔符与破折号的其他用途区分开来的任务比看起来合理的要多。关于普罗特斯的其他用途，也有类似的故事。Proteus的引用参考部分变得更加专业化，并被拆分成自己的笔记本。Proteus的一部分最初是支持日程安排的，后来逐渐变得更加复杂和专业化，直到它被一个外部日历应用程序的链接所取代。全局目录最初是一个常规的TOC（如图3所示），后来才逐渐发展成如图2所示的类似浏览器的结构。一次又一次地从一般性和简单性转向专门化和复杂性。虽然有很多简化的例子（例如，删除未使用的功能），但这些简化通常是由为新功能腾出空间的愿望触发的。</p><p>  When I began using Proteus, I had a relatively simple application that was easy to use and to explain to others. Now, Proteus is much more complex; it has quite a few features that are useful only to me, and that make the interface more complex and difficult to learn for anyone else. In the process of being customized for my purposes, Proteus has shifted from being usable (by anyone) to being useful (to me).     This raises some interesting questions. How general is this tradeoff between simplicity and usability on the one hand, and specialization and complexity on the other? Will technologies like OpenDoc, which promise to support customization, manifest this trend? Or, less generally, suppose that three years ago I had been magically given Proteus as it is structured today: would I have found it either usable or useful? I suspect the answer is no. My guess is that my work practices had to gradually evolve in consonance with the structure and function of Proteus. That is, rather than this being a process of me gradually customizing Proteus to my needs, it feels more like a process of co-evolution in which the electronic notebook and my work practices have mutually conditioned one another. For example, as previously noted, the use of Proteus resulted in me being more willing to attend large meetings, and in turn, more frequent use of Proteus in large meetings resulted in various adaptations for more effective use in such situations (e.g., an easy way to turn the sound off).</p><p>当我开始使用Proteus时，我有一个相对简单的应用程序，易于使用并向他人解释。现在，变形菌要复杂得多；它有很多只对我有用的特性，这使得界面更复杂，其他人也更难学习。在为我的目的定制的过程中，Proteus已经从（任何人）都可以使用转变为（对我）有用。这引发了一些有趣的问题。一方面简单性和可用性，另一方面专业化和复杂性之间的权衡有多普遍？像OpenDoc这样承诺支持定制的技术会体现这一趋势吗？或者，不那么笼统地说，假设三年前我被神奇地赋予了今天的结构：我会发现它有用还是有用？我怀疑答案是否定的。我的猜测是，我的工作实践必须逐渐发展，以符合普罗特斯的结构和功能。也就是说，这不是我根据自己的需求逐渐定制Proteus的过程，它更像是一个协同进化的过程，在这个过程中，电子笔记本和我的工作实践相互制约。例如，如前所述，使用Proteus使我更愿意参加大型会议，反过来，在大型会议中更频繁地使用Proteus使我能够适应各种情况，以便在这种情况下更有效地使用（例如，关闭声音的简单方法）。</p><p>
