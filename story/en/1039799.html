The ten men were all security guards, who were deployed to work at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Norway, according to Dagbladet’s sources. But Saudi Arabia wanted the security guards to be registered as diplomats in Norway. This would give them extended room for manoeuvring in Norway.</p><p> 外交部向达格布拉德（Dagbladet）证实，沙特阿拉伯想派遣十名正式任务前往挪威。据达格布拉德的消息来源说，这十个人全部是保安人员，被派往挪威的沙特阿拉伯大使馆工作。但是沙特阿拉伯希望保安人员在挪威注册为外交官。这将使他们有更大的在挪威进行机动的空间。</p><p> The Ministry of Foreign Affairs intervened, and the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) has informed Iyad el-Baghdadi (43) - a Norway-based journalist, activist, and critic of the Saudi regime - about the incident.</p><p> 外交部进行了干预，挪威警察安全局（PST）已将此事件告知了挪威记者，激进主义者和沙特阿拉伯政权批评家伊亚德·巴格达迪（43）。</p><p> Dagbladet has asked the Saudi embassy several questions regarding this article. The embassy has responded with a press release they originally sent out last year, criticising &#34;fabricated and false&#34; accusations, &#34;with the intent to insult Saudi Arabia.&#34;</p><p> 达格布拉德（Dagbladet）向沙特大使馆询问了有关本文的几个问题。大使馆最初在去年发出了一份新闻稿，以批评和捏造和虚假为由对此作出回应。侮辱沙特阿拉伯的指控。</p><p>  Dagbladet has received confirmation from several sources that there were several issues regarding the ten-man security team that made the Norwegian authorities react.</p><p>  达格布拉德（Dagbladet）从数个来源获得证实，有关由十人组成的安全小组的若干问题促使挪威当局作出反应。</p><p>   •  The number: The number of security guards was unusually high. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs regularly publishes a list of all foreign diplomats accredited to Norway. According to the diplomat list from the summer of 2018, the total number of Saudi diplomats in Norway at the time was 18. Both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the PST were surprised that the Saudis were about to almost double the number - with only security people.</p><p>   •人数：保安人员的数量异常高。外交部定期公布所有认可挪威的外国外交官的名单。根据2018年夏季的外交官名单，当时挪威的沙特外交官总数为18名。外交部和PST都对沙特人几乎翻了一番感到惊讶-仅出于安全考虑人。</p><p>  •  The status: Both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the PST were surprised that Saudi Arabia requested that the security guards be granted diplomatic status - and registered in the official  Diplomat List. It is unusual for security people at embassies to be registered as diplomats. Both diplomats and other embassy personell - arriving on a so-called «D-visa» to Norway - is given  diplomatic immunity. Which, as one of several benefits, means that the host country cannot arrest you if you commit a crime. But being registered formally as a diplomat gives you a wider range of benefits.</p><p>  •身份：外交部和PST都对沙特阿拉伯要求授予安全卫士外交身份并在正式外交官名单中注册感到惊讶。使馆的安全人员被登记为外交官是不寻常的。外交官和其他使馆人员-乘所谓的“ D-签证”到达挪威-均获得外交豁免权。作为多项好处之一，这意味着如果您犯罪，东道国无法逮捕您。但是，正式注册为外交官可以为您带来更多好处。 </p><p> •  The increase: Norwegian authorities reacted to the fact that the major increase in security staff did not reflect what they knew regarding the activity level at the embassy.</p><p>•增加：挪威当局对安保人员的大幅增加没有反映他们对使馆活动水平的了解这一事实作出了反应。</p><p> •  The key role: Officials at PST have later noted that security personnel, from the consulate in Istanbul, played key roles in the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Dagbladet has learned.</p><p> •关键作用：PST的官员后来指出，伊斯坦布尔领事馆的安全人员在谋杀沙特记者Jamal Khashoggi的过程中发挥了关键作用。</p><p>  The PST declined to comment on this article, however, it has been presented with all the information herein – without finding any errors.</p><p>  PST拒绝对本文发表评论，但是，本文已将其包含所有信息-并未发现任何错误。</p><p>  Guri Solberg, spokesperson at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, confirms in an e-mail to Dagbladet:</p><p>  外交部发言人古里·索尔伯格（Guri Solberg）在致达格布拉德（Dagbladet）的电子邮件中确认：</p><p> “In the summer of 2018, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs registered ten persons as new envoys at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Oslo. The status of other countries&#39; envoys to embassies is regulated by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) and the role of the envoy at the embassy. As these were mainly persons who were to have internal tasks at the embassy, nine of the ten persons were registered as administrative / technical personnel in accordance with normal practice. One of the ten people was registered as a diplomat based on their role and responsibilities. In practice, there is little difference in the degree of immunity and privileges granted to diplomatic, administrative, and technical personnel. The rules on immunity and privileges are dictated by international law by which Norway is bound, in particular the Vienna Convention of Diplomatic Relations, that includes immunity from criminal prosecution in the host state.”</p><p> “ 2018年夏天，外交部在奥斯陆的沙特阿拉伯大使馆登记了10名新使节。其他国家的地位使馆使节受《维也纳外交关系公约》（1961年）和使节在使馆的作用的约束。由于这些人主要是要在使馆内部执行任务的人员，因此在十个人中有九个人按照常规惯例被注册为行政/技术人员。十个人中有一个根据其角色和职责被注册为外交官。实际上，给予外交，行政和技术人员的豁免和特权的程度几乎没有差异。豁免和特权规则受挪威约束的国际法规定，特别是《维也纳外交关系公约》，其中包括对东道国免于刑事起诉的豁免。”</p><p>  Solberg adds: “For reasons of confidentiality, we cannot share details in individual cases.”</p><p>  索尔伯格补充说：“出于保密的考虑，我们无法在个别情况下共享细节。”</p><p>  The men arrived in Norway at the end of July 2018. The one security guard who received the diplomatic status Saudi Arabia requested, now works as Head of Security at the Saudi Arabian embassy, according to Dagbladet&#39;s sources. He is formally listed in the Foreign Ministry&#39;s diplomatic list as an &#34;attaché&#34;.</p><p>  这些人于2018年7月底到达挪威。据达格布拉德的消息来源称，一名获得沙特阿拉伯要求的外交身份的保安人员现在在沙特阿拉伯大使馆担任安全负责人。他被以外交官的身份正式列入外交部的外交名单。 </p><p>  “It was a discussion. There are regulations for the type of status that the embassies&#39; security people can hold whilst staying in Norway. They are not diplomats”, a source familiar with the case tells Dagbladet.</p><p>“这是一次讨论。对于使馆的身份类型有规定。在挪威逗留期间，安全人员可以持有。他们不是外交官”，熟悉此案的消息人士告诉达格布拉德。</p><p> According to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, all envoys from other countries have diplomatic immunity when they are working for their country’s embassy. This applies to both diplomats and administrative personnel, such as security staff.</p><p> 根据《维也纳外交关系公约》，来自其他国家的所有使节在为自己国家的使馆工作时均享有外交豁免权。这适用于外交官和行政人员，例如安全人员。</p><p> However, different degrees of immunity are granted, according to the rank of the individual within the system. Only diplomats have full immunity.</p><p> 但是，根据系统中个人的等级，可以授予不同程度的免疫力。只有外交官才能享有全部豁免权。</p><p> Neither diplomats nor security staff at embassies can be prosecuted or subjected to taxation in Norway. Security staff (administrative personnel) do not, however, have immunity from civil proceedings arising from their conduct in private. Whilst diplomats can import as much as they desire tax-free for private use, administrative personnel are only exempt from customs duties on entry to a country.</p><p> 在挪威，外交官和大使馆的安全人员都不会受到起诉或征税。但是，安保人员（行政人员）不受私人诉讼行为引起的民事诉讼的豁免。外交官可以进口任意数量的免税私人用途，而行政人员仅在进入一个国家时免除关税。</p><p> Norway can sanction an envoy with diplomatic immunity by declaring them persona non grata in Norway.</p><p> 挪威可以宣布外交官为不受欢迎的人，从而给予其外交豁免权。</p><p>   If you travel by sea to the Frognerstranda harbour, at times you can spot the Kingdom&#39;s characteristic green flag - with a white sabre, and the inscription &#34;There is no god without Allah, and Muhammad is his prophet&#34; - waving over the hedge. From a magnificent villa, designed in 1899 by the famed Norwegian architect Ingvar Hjorth, Saudi Arabia manages its activities in Norway.</p><p>   如果您乘船前往Frognerstranda港口，有时您会发现王国的特色绿旗-带有白色军刀，铭文上没有真主，穆罕默德是他的先知34; -在树篱上挥舞着。沙特阿拉伯从一栋由著名挪威建筑师Ingvar Hjorth于1899年设计的宏伟别墅中管理其在挪威的活动。</p><p>  Dagbladet has asked the Embassy in Oslo why they requested the security guards be granted diplomatic immunity, about the points Norway reacted to, about the Embassy’s relationship with the activist Iyad el-Baghdadi, and about why the Embassy wanted to increase the number of security guards by so many.</p><p>  达格布拉德（Dagbladet）已问过奥斯陆大使馆，为什么要求他们授予外交卫队豁免权，挪威对此作出的回应，大使馆与激进主义者伊亚德·巴格达迪（Iyad el-Baghdadi）的关系以及大使馆为何想增加保安员的数量太多了 </p><p> The Embassy has declined to meet with Dagbladet, preferring to respond by email, with a press release originally sent out in 2019:</p><p>大使馆拒绝与达格布拉德会面，而是希望通过电子邮件回复，最初于2019年发出新闻稿：</p><p> &#34;The Embassy is informed about what has been circulated in some media in regard to Mr. Iyad el-Baghdadi and the allegations against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Embassy would like to clarify that this person is not a Saudi citizen and is unknown to the Kingdom. What he said is fabricated and false and aims to offend the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We have been in contact with the Norwegian Government to provide the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with further information in this regard. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reserves the right to take the necessary legal measures against the mentioned-above in order to safeguard its rights.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;使馆获悉在一些媒体上流传的关于伊亚德·巴格达迪先生以及针对沙特阿拉伯王国的指控的信息。大使馆想澄清一下，该人不是沙特公民，王国不知道。他所说的是虚假的，旨在冒犯沙特阿拉伯王国。我们已经与挪威政府联系，以向沙特阿拉伯王国提供这方面的进一步信息。沙特阿拉伯王国保留对上述措施采取必要法律措施的权利，以维护其权利。＆＃34;</p><p>     The apartment where he currently lives – he moves regularly - contains little other than various cutlery, some clothes, and computer equipment with heavy encryption. A small room with weights and exercise equipment emphasizes the need, as he says, to always stay “sharp”.</p><p>     他目前居住的公寓-他定期搬家-除了各种餐具，一些衣服和经过严格加密的计算机设备外，几乎没有其他东西。正如他所说，一间装有举重和健身器材的小房间强调了始终保持“锋利”的必要。</p><p> According to Dagbladet’s information it is the Oslo police district which oversee his security.</p><p> 根据达格布拉德的资料，奥斯陆警察区负责监督他的安全。</p><p> He claims they advised him to move out of his previous apartment not too long ago.</p><p> 他声称他们建议他不久前搬出他以前的公寓。</p><p> El-Baghdadi, originally a stateless Palestinian, became an influential voice - particularly on Twitter - during the Arab Spring. He was a friend of Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist who was killed in October 2018 at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.</p><p> 最初是无国籍的巴勒斯坦人的巴格达迪（El-Baghdadi）在阿拉伯之春期间成为有影响力的声音-特别是在Twitter上。他是新闻记者Jamal Khashoggi的朋友，他于2018年10月在伊斯坦布尔的沙特领事馆被杀。</p><p>     At the same time that Saudi Arabia requested that the security team were registeret as diplomats - in the spring / early summer of 2018 - el-Baghdadi and Khashoggi met in Oslo. According to Dagbladet&#39;s information, PST has not uncovered any form of physical threat to el-Baghdadi in Norway. However, Dagbladet knows that PST informed him about the Saudi security team in a meeting.</p><p>     与此同时，沙特阿拉伯要求安全小组以身分作为外交官-在2018年春/夏初-埃尔·巴格达迪和卡修吉在奥斯陆会面。根据Dagbladet的信息，PST尚未发现对挪威的Baghdadi的任何形式的物理威胁。但是，达格布拉德知道PST在一次会议上向他介绍了沙特安全小组。 </p><p> - I had a meeting with my contact in PST in January this year. They said Saudi Arabia had applied for an unusually high number of diplomatic visas - which were denied. PST did not say when it had happened, but you are now telling me that it was the summer of 2018, el-Baghdadi tells Dagbladet. He adds:</p><p>-今年1月，我与PST的联系人开会。他们说，沙特阿拉伯已申请了异常多的外交签证，但遭到拒绝。 PST没有透露发生的时间，但是您现在告诉我那是2018年的夏天，el-Baghdadi告诉达格布拉德。他补充说：</p><p>  - PST also said that the Norwegian authorities have reported to the Saudi government, regarding threats against me - where Saudi Arabia was asked to stay away.</p><p>  -太平洋标准时间（PST）也表示，挪威当局已就对我的威胁向沙特政府报告-沙特阿拉伯被要求远离该国。</p><p> The Guardian received confirmation last year that the CIA notified the PST about a possible threat to Iyad el-Baghdadi. The threat is said to be linked to his  key role in exposing Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman&#39;s alleged hacking of Jeff Bezos, who owns Amazon and the Washington Post.</p><p> 去年，《卫报》得到确认，即中央情报局已将有关Iyad el-Baghdadi的可能威胁通知了PST。据说，这种威胁与他在揭露王储穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼（Mohammed bin Salman）涉嫌黑客入侵拥有亚马逊和《华盛顿邮报》的杰夫·贝索斯（Jeff Bezos）中的关键作用有关。</p><p>  This was the case where Saudi Arabia originally sent out the press release Dagbladet has now received once more - about false accusations and a smear campaign against the country.</p><p>  沙特阿拉伯最初发出的新闻稿就是这种情况，达格布拉德现在又收到了有关假指控和针对该国的诽谤运动的新闻。</p><p>   - Jamal Khashoggi was in Norway himself in May 2018 - he stayed at the Christiania Teater hotel, says el-Baghdadi.</p><p>   -巴尔格达迪（El-Baghdadi）说，贾马尔·卡舒吉（Jamal Khashoggi）于2018年5月亲自在挪威-他住在克里斯蒂安尼娅·泰特尔酒店。</p><p> - At that time, Saudi Arabia was completely obsessed about Jamal Khashoggi. I am sure they had people watching him, and I was with him all the time. If they sent a team, I would assume it was to find out what was going on between me and Khashoggi. We talked about meeting again and doing projects together.</p><p> -当时，沙特阿拉伯完全痴迷于贾马尔·卡舒吉（Jamal Khashoggi）。我确信他们有人在看着他，而我一直都和他在一起。如果他们派遣了一支队伍，我认为那是要找出我和卡舒吉之间发生的事情。我们谈论了再次开会和一起做项目。</p><p> Dagbladet has submitted all the information to PST, which has not found any errors. Dagbladet is further informed that the Norwegian Embassy in Riyadh was involved in the case and has asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about this matter. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs says they cannot comment on individual cases.</p><p> Dagbladet已将所有信息提交给PST，但尚未发现任何错误。达格布拉迪特进一步获悉，挪威驻利雅得大使馆卷入了此案，并已向外交部询问此事。外交部表示，他们无法对个别案件发表评论。 </p><p>   In 2014, the same year that Iyad el-Baghdadi was imprisoned and deported from the United Arab Emirates - his home country at the time, he and Jamal Khashoggi began following each other on social media. In 2018, they started planning projects together. As a journalist and activist, el-Baghdadi has been involved in collecting information about two of the most serious cases involving the Saudi regime:</p><p>2014年，也就是伊亚德·巴格达迪（Iyad el-Baghdadi）被囚禁并从阿拉伯联合酋长国（当时是他的祖国）驱逐出境的那一年，他和贾马尔·卡舒吉（Jamal Khashoggi）开始在社交媒体上互相关注。在2018年，他们开始一起计划项目。作为记者和激进主义者，巴格达迪参与收集有关沙特政权的两个最严重案件的信息：</p><p>  The murder of his friend Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul.  Saudi Arabia has confirmed, after several attempts at denying responsibility, that Khashoggi was killed by government officials on official duty. Five men were sentenced to death in December 2019 for their roles in the murder - whereupon the death sentences were revoked in September this year, and the sentences were significantly reduced, US intelligence concluded that  he was killed on the orders of Crown Prince bin Salman. The Crown Prince has in interviews apologized for the murder, but denies having ordered it, and has described it as a “regrettable mistake”.</p><p>  他的朋友Jamal Khashoggi在伊斯坦布尔被谋杀。沙特阿拉伯经过几次否认责任的确认，已确认Khashoggi被执行公务的政府官员杀害。五名男子因在谋杀中的作用于2019年12月被判处死刑-随后于今年9月撤销了死刑判决，刑期大大减少，美国情报得出的结论是，他是根据本·萨勒曼王储的命令被杀的。王储在采访中为谋杀表示道歉，但否认下了命令，并将其描述为“令人遗憾的错误”。</p><p> The case where Mohammed bin Salman is said to  have hacked the mobile phone of Jeff Bezos, the world&#39;s richest man.</p><p> 据说穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼（Mohammed bin Salman）入侵了世界首富杰夫·贝佐斯（Jeff Bezos）的手机。</p><p>  El-Baghdadi&#39;s role in the investigations has been confirmed to Dagbladet by human rights lawyer Agnes Callamard, who is the UN&#39;s special rapporteur for extrajudicial executions. It was Callamard who in January  announced that the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia was behind the hacking of Jeff Bezos&#39; phone. Bezos owns the Washington Post where Khashoggi worked as a commentator.</p><p>  联合国驻法外处决特别报告员人权律师艾格尼丝·卡拉玛德（Agnes Callamard）向达格布拉德确认了埃尔·巴格达迪在调查中的作用。正是卡拉马德（Callamard）在1月宣布沙特阿拉伯王储是杰夫·贝索斯（Jeff Bezos）遭黑客入侵的幕后黑手。电话。贝索斯拥有《华盛顿邮报》，卡修吉曾在该杂志担任评论员。</p><p>  According to the UN report, and a column written by Bezos&#39; security chief,  Gavin de Becker, Bezos was hacked via a message  sent from bin Salman&#39;s personal mobile phone. Dagbladet has been in contact with de Becker, who har declined to comment on the case. Saudi Arabia&#39;s Deputy Foreign Minister, Adel al-Jubeir, has  dismissed the allegations as &#34;nonsense and lies&#34;.</p><p>  根据联合国的报告，贝索斯（Bezos＆＃39）撰写了专栏；贝佐斯（Bezos）安全负责人加文·德·贝克尔（Gavin de Becker）通过本·萨勒曼（bin Salman）的个人手机发送的消息被黑。达格布拉德（Dagbladet）与德贝克尔（de Becker）保持联系，后者拒绝对此案发表评论。沙特阿拉伯副外交大臣阿德尔·朱拜尔（Adel al-Jubeir）将指控归咎于胡说和谎言。</p><p>  Dagbladet has repeatedly tried to get the Saudi Arabian Embassy to meet us to talk about the case - without success. Instead, the Embassy responded by e-mail, with the press release from 2019. Dagbladet has also presented the case to the foreign and information ministries in Riyadh, without receiving any response.</p><p>  达格布拉德（Dagbladet）曾多次试图让沙特阿拉伯大使馆与我们会谈此案-但没有成功。取而代之的是，大使馆通过电子邮件回复了该新闻，新闻稿发布于2019年。达格布拉德也已将该案件提交给利雅得的外交和新闻部，但未收到任何回复。</p><p> The Oslo police district tells Dagbladet they cannot comment on el-Baghdadi’s or any other individual&#39;s security and housing situation, due to security reasons.</p><p> 奥斯陆警察区告诉达格布拉德，由于安全原因，他们无法对巴格达迪或任何其他个人的安全和住房状况发表评论。 </p><p>                       dagbladet er en del av Aller Media, som er ansvarlig for dine data.
