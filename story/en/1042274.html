According to the police report, a cord had been wrapped around his neck, his face and his feet. He had been dragged behind a vehicle so forcefully that he had abrasions along his back, and his skull had been partly flattened. The medical examiner attributed French&#39;s death to &#34;homicidal violence.&#34; But then his grieving family heard nothing about arrests.</p><p> 法国人，一个八岁的祖父，他总是试图帮助人们“走运”，他的女儿隆达·汉密尔顿（Ronda Hamilton）告诉卡拉玛祖国家广播公司（KBC）的NBC分支机构伍德，三周前失踪了。根据警察的报告，一根绳子缠在他的脖子，脸和脚上。他被用力地拖到一辆车的后面，以至于他的背上擦伤了，他的头骨被部分弄平了。体检医师将法国人的死亡归咎于杀人暴力。但随后，他悲痛的家人对逮捕一事一无所获。</p><p>   For more than two years, Kalamazoo County sheriff&#39;s detectives investigated French&#39;s murder without making any arrests. Then, according to police records obtained by NBC News, one of the detectives learned of an emerging field — digital vehicle forensics — which focuses on extracting the treasure trove of data stored in an automobile&#39;s onboard computers.</p><p>   两年多来，卡拉马祖县警长对法国人的谋杀案进行了调查，没有逮捕任何人。然后，根据NBC新闻获得的警方记录，其中一名侦探了解到了一个新兴领域-数字汽车取证-该研究重点是提取存储在汽车车载计算机中的数据宝库。</p><p> They returned to French&#39;s 2016 black Chevy Silverado pickup truck, which had been stolen around the time he vanished, and discovered time-stamped recordings of someone else&#39;s voice using the hands-free system to play Eminem on the radio at the time of French&#39;s murder.</p><p> 他们返回法国2016年的黑色雪佛兰西尔维拉多皮卡车，这辆卡车在他消失后就被偷了，并使用免提系统在别人的声音中打了时间戳记，以录制别人的声音。法国谋杀时的广播电台。</p><p> The voice, according to the police report obtained by NBC News, belonged to Joshua Wessel, now 32, who used to tinker on cars and motorcycles with French. Wessel&#39;s voice was identified by relatives, including his wife, key evidence that allowed investigators to reconstruct his movements and the final hours of French&#39;s life, the police report says. In July, Wessel was arrested and charged with French&#39;s murder. He has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial subject to psychiatric assessment.</p><p> 根据NBC新闻获得的警方报告，该声音属于现年32岁的约书亚·韦塞尔（Joshua Wessel），他曾经用法语来修补汽车和摩托车。警方的报告说，韦塞尔的声音被包括他的妻子在内的亲戚所识别，这是使调查人员能够重建他的动作和法国人生命的最后时刻的主要证据。 7月，韦塞尔被捕，并被指控谋杀法国人。他不认罪，正在等待接受精神病学评估的审判。</p><p>   In recent years, investigators have realized that automobiles — particularly newer models — can be treasure troves of digital evidence. Their onboard computers generate and store data that can be used to reconstruct where a vehicle has been and what its passengers were doing. They reveal everything from location, speed and acceleration to when doors were opened and closed, whether texts and calls were made while the cellphone was plugged into the infotainment system, as well as voice commands and web histories.</p><p>   近年来，研究人员已经意识到，汽车（尤其是较新的汽车）可以成为数字证据的宝库。他们的车载计算机生成并存储数据，这些数据可用于重建车辆的位置以及乘客的活动。它们显示了从位置，速度和加速度到开门和关门的时间，以及手机插入信息娱乐系统时是否发出了短信和通话，以及语音命令和网络历史记录。</p><p>  But that boon for forensic investigators creates fear for privacy activists, who warn that the lack of information security baked into vehicles&#39; computers poses a risk to consumers and who call for safeguards to be put in place.</p><p>  但是，这给法医调查员带来了福音，这使隐私权活动家感到恐惧，他们警告说，缺乏信息安全性已经渗透到了车辆中。计算机会对消费者构成风险，他们要求采取防护措施。 </p><p> &#34;I hear a lot of analogies of cars being smartphones on wheels. But that&#39;s vastly reductive,&#34; said Andrea Amico, founder of Privacy4Cars, which makes a free app that helps people delete their data from automobiles and makes its money by offering the service to rental companies and dealerships. &#34;If you think about the amount of sensors in a car, the smartphone is a toy. A car has GPS, an accelerometer, a camera. A car will know how much you weigh. Most people don&#39;t realize this is happening.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34;我听到很多比喻说汽车是带轮智能手机的。但这是非常简化的， Privacy4Cars的创始人安德里亚·阿米科（Andrea Amico）说，该公司提供了一个免费的应用程序，可以帮助人们从汽车中删除数据，并通过向租赁公司和经销店提供服务来赚钱。 ＆＃34;如果您考虑一下汽车中的传感器数量，那么智能手机就是玩具。汽车上装有GPS，加速度计和照相机。汽车将知道您的体重。大多数人没有意识到这正在发生。</p><p>   Law enforcement agencies have been focusing their investigative efforts on two main information sources: the telematics system — which is like the &#34;black box&#34; — and the infotainment system. The telematics system stores a vehicle&#39;s turn-by-turn navigation, speed, acceleration and deceleration information, as well as more granular clues, such as when and where the lights were switched on, the doors were opened, seat belts were put on and airbags were deployed.</p><p>   执法机构一直将调查工作的重点放在两个主要的信息源上：远程信息处理系统-类似于“黑匣子”。 —和信息娱乐系统。远程信息处理系统存储车辆的逐行导航，速度，加速和减速信息，以及更详细的线索，例如何时何地打开照明灯，车门是否打开，安全带是否处于打开状态。戴上安全气囊并展开。</p><p> The infotainment system records recent destinations, call logs, contact lists, text messages, emails, pictures, videos, web histories, voice commands and social media feeds. It can also keep track of the phones that have been connected to the vehicle via USB cable or Bluetooth, as well as all the apps installed on the device.</p><p> 信息娱乐系统记录最近的目的地，通话记录，联系人列表，短信，电子邮件，图片，视频，网络历史记录，语音命令和社交媒体供稿。它还可以跟踪通过USB电缆或蓝牙连接到车辆的电话，以及设备上安装的所有应用。</p><p>  Together, the data allows investigators to reconstruct a vehicle&#39;s journey and paint a picture of driver and passenger behavior. In a criminal case, the sequence of doors opening and seat belts being inserted could help show that a suspect had an accomplice.</p><p>  这些数据一起使调查人员能够重构车辆的行程并绘制驾驶员和乘客行为的图片。在刑事案件中，开门和插入安全带的顺序可能有助于表明犯罪嫌疑人有帮凶。</p><p> &#34;I&#39;m sure everyone is aware of how much forensic data is on the phone,&#34; said Lam Nguyen, director of the Defense Cyber Crime Center, a federal forensic laboratory and training center. &#34;What people don&#39;t realize is a lot of that is being transmitted to a car just because you register the phone with the car.&#34;</p><p> 我确定每个人都知道电话中有多少取证数据，＆＃34;联邦法医实验室和培训中心国防网络犯罪中心主任林阮说。人们没有意识到的是，很多是因为您在汽车上注册了电话而被传输到汽车上的。</p><p> But compared with the security on smartphones, the security on the systems is much flimsier, digital forensic and privacy experts say. Drivers typically don&#39;t have to unlock a vehicle&#39;s infotainment system with a passcode or a fingerprint, as they do with smartphones. That means that, with a warrant, law enforcement officials can sometimes extract incriminating text messages, calls or files from an automobile far more easily than they could from a suspect&#39;s cellphone.</p><p> 数字取证和隐私专家说，但是与智能手机上的安全性相比，系统上的安全性更加脆弱。驾驶员通常不必像使用智能手机那样使用密码或指纹来解锁车辆的信息娱乐系统。这意味着，执法人员有时可以凭手令从汽车中提取有罪的短信，电话或文件，而这比从犯罪嫌疑人的手机中提取信息要容易得多。</p><p> &#34;If you&#39;ve committed some heinous crime and we can&#39;t get into your phone, we can get peripheral data that has been synced to your car,&#34; Nguyen said. &#34;The contact list, calls made, text messages. In almost any criminal investigation, communication with the victim or co-conspirators is hugely important. Taking that with the telematics you get — how many people were in the car, how many doors opened — and it all paints a strong picture.&#34;</p><p> 如果您犯下了一些令人发指的罪行，而我们却无法进入您的手机，我们将获取已同步到您汽车上的外围设备数据，＆＃34;阮说。 ＆＃34;联系人列表，拨打的电话，短信。在几乎所有的刑事调查中，与受害人或同谋的交流非常重要。借助远程信息处理技术，您可以得到-汽车中有多少人，有多少扇门打开了-这一切都描绘出一副强烈的图画。 </p><p>   More law enforcement agencies nationwide are using the data to solve cases, and they are devoting more and more resources to this new type of crime solving, law enforcement officers and digital forensic examiners say. That&#39;s partly because the main toolkit law enforcement officers and forensic examiners use has drastically expanded its offerings. Berla Corp., a Maryland-based technology company, launched a tool in 2013 with the ability to access 80 car models. Now, the company says, the number is more than 14,000, including vehicles from General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.</p><p>执法人员和数字法医检查人员说，全国越来越多的执法机构正在使用这些数据来解决案件，并且他们正在将越来越多的资源用于这种新型的犯罪解决方案。这部分是因为执法人员和法医检查人员使用的主要工具包已大大扩展了产品范围。马里兰州的科技公司Berla Corp.在2013年推出了一种工具，能够访问80种汽车模型。该公司表示，现在，这一数字已超过14,000，其中包括通用汽车，福特，大众，宝马和梅赛德斯-奔驰的车辆。</p><p>  &#34;It helps convict people, and it can help prove they are innocent,&#34; Berla founder Ben LeMere said. &#34;Children&#39;s bodies have been found. Families have had closure.&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;帮助定罪的人，并可以证明他们是无辜的，＆＃34; Berla创始人Ben LeMere说。已找到儿童的尸体。家庭已经关闭。＆＃34;</p><p> Chris Prevette, a detective sergeant with the Michigan State Police Computer Crimes Unit, responsible for the forensic extraction of data from vehicles in the state, was the first person in the agency to start extracting data from automobiles as part of criminal investigations five years ago. Today, four offices across the state do it routinely for &#34;smaller, everyday felonies,&#34; he said, &#34;sometimes two to three times a week.&#34;</p><p> 密歇根州警察计算机犯罪部门的侦探中士克里斯·普雷维特（Chris Prevette）负责该州车辆的取证，这是该机构中第一个在五年前开始从汽车中提取数据的人。如今，全州有四个办事处按惯例为较小的日常重罪做这件事。他说，有时是每周两到三遍。</p><p> Prevette used the technology in an October 2018 case in Norton Shores, Michigan, where police pulled data from a car that had been stolen and later abandoned during a traffic stop. They recovered a log of the journey it had taken the night it was stolen, including two stops it had made at an RV dealership more than 20 miles away in Coopersville County. The data trail showed precisely when the car had parked and the driver&#39;s door opened and closed. The dealership had closed-circuit video of a former employee, David Asher, 55, a handyman who did maintenance work on trailers and RVs, stealing money from the business at the same time.</p><p> Prevette在2018年10月在密歇根州诺顿海岸的一宗案件中使用了该技术，当时警方从被盗，后来在交通停车期间被遗弃的汽车中提取数据。他们记录了被盗当晚所经历的旅程的日志，包括在距库珀斯维尔县20英里外的一家RV经销商处进行的两次停留。数据跟踪准确显示了汽车何时停车以及驾驶员的车门是否打开和关闭。该经销店的闭路视频是一位前雇员戴维·阿舍尔（David Asher），现年55岁，他是一名杂物工，负责拖车和房车的维修工作，同时从公司中偷钱。</p><p> Without data pulled from the car, police wouldn&#39;t have connected the theft of the car to the burglary of the business, nor would they have pinned their suspect. Asher pleaded guilty to larceny, home invasion and an assault on a police officer during his arrest. He&#39;s serving a minimum two-year sentence in Carson City Correctional Facility.</p><p> 如果没有从汽车中提取数据，警方将不会把汽车的盗窃行为与企业的爆窃案联系起来，也不会将嫌疑人锁定。阿舍尔在被捕期间承认了盗窃罪，家庭入侵和对警察的殴打罪。他在卡森市惩教所中至少服刑两年。</p><p>  &#34;We knew he was a suspect, but we didn&#39;t have any hard evidence in the vehicle. It was really how we were able to put him in the vehicle and show how he stole it,&#34; said Ryan Pieske, the detective on the case. &#34;I wasn&#39;t surprised to see the GPS information. But to see things like when the vehicle shifts, when the doors are open, phones connecting, text messages — there was so much more than I expected there to be.&#34;</p><p>  我们知道他是嫌疑犯，但我们在车上没有任何确凿的证据。确实，我们能够将他放到车上并展示他是如何偷走的，＆＃34;案件侦探瑞恩·皮斯克（Ryan Pieske）说。看到GPS信息我并不感到惊讶。但是要看到诸如车辆换档，车门打开，电话连接，短信等情况，这比我预期的要多得多。＆＃34;</p><p>   The growing use of automobile information by law enforcement agencies also has increased because most people don&#39;t realize how much information their vehicles are tracking and that they can try to stop it.</p><p>   执法机构越来越多地使用汽车信息，这是因为大多数人没有意识到他们的车辆正在跟踪多少信息，因此他们可以尝试阻止这些信息。 </p><p> LeMere and other representatives from Berla frequently refer to the relative lack of public awareness about and lack of security in vehicle infotainment systems in presentations to law enforcement, videos of which have been seen by NBC News. LeMere was reluctant to answer questions over the phone.</p><p>LeMere和Berla的其他代表经常在执法演示中提到公众对车辆信息娱乐系统的认识相对缺乏，并且缺乏安全性，NBC新闻已经观看了这些视频。 LeMere不愿通过电话回答问题。</p><p>  &#34;People rent cars and go do things with them and don&#39;t even think about the places they are going and what the car records,&#34; LeMere said in a  June interview for a podcast made by Cellebrite, a company that makes tools to help law enforcement agencies extract data from locked mobile phones. &#34;Most of them aren&#39;t doing anything wrong, but it&#39;s pretty funny to see the hookers and blow request text messages and answers.&#34;</p><p>  人们租车去和他们一起做事，甚至不去想他们要去的地方和那辆车的记录，＆＃34; LeMere在六月接受Cellebrite制作的播客的采访中说，Cellebrite是一家制造工具的公司，该工具可以帮助执法机构从锁定的手机中提取数据。他们中的大多数并没有做错任何事情，但是看到妓女并吹嘘请求短信和答案真是太有趣了。＆＃34;</p><p> As automobiles become more automated, with self-parking and other &#34;smart&#34; features, they need more sophisticated sensors and computers, which means autos of the future will collect even more data, digital forensic and privacy experts say.  Several technology companies and automakers, such as Volvo and Bosch, have developed driver-facing cameras to detect whether the driver is paying attention to the road. While the features are designed for safety, they could also be a rich source of potential evidence: video from inside the car.</p><p> 随着汽车的自动化程度越来越高，自动泊车和其他“智能”功能变得越来越强大。数字鉴识和隐私专家说，为了实现这些功能，他们需要更先进的传感器和计算机，这意味着未来的汽车将收集更多数据。沃尔沃（Volvo）和博世（Bosch）等数家技术公司和汽车制造商已经开发了面向驾驶员的摄像头，以检测驾驶员是否关注道路。虽然这些功能是为安全而设计的，但它们也可能是潜在证据的丰富来源：来自车内的视频。</p><p> &#34;We are moving in a direction where more sensors and cameras will be required inside the car for driver or occupant monitoring and on the outside for automated vehicles,&#34; said Chelsey Colbert, policy counsel at the Future of Privacy Forum, a data privacy think tank. &#34;Car manufacturers need to focus on privacy by design.&#34;</p><p> ＆nbsp;我们正在朝着在车内需要更多传感器和摄像头进行驾驶员或乘员监控以及在车外需要更多传感器和摄像头的方向发展，＆＃34;数据隐私智囊团Future of Privacy Forum的政策顾问Chelsey Colbert说。 ＆＃34;汽车制造商需要通过设计关注隐私。</p><p>   Just as the trove of data can be helpful for solving crimes, it can also be used to commit them, Amico said. He pointed to a case in Australia, where a man stalked his ex-girlfriend using an app that connected to her high-tech Land Rover and sent him live information about her movements. The app also allowed him to remotely start and stop her vehicle and open and close the windows.</p><p>   Amico说，就像大量的数据可以帮助解决犯罪一样，它也可以用于犯罪。他指出了澳大利亚的一个案例，其中一名男子使用与她的高科技路虎（Land Rover）连接的应用跟踪了他的前女友，并向他发送了有关其运动的实时信息。该应用程序还允许他远程启动和停止车辆以及打开和关闭窗户。</p><p>  &#34;These crimes have made me feel unsafe,&#34; the victim told the court,  according to ABC News Australia, which named neither the victim nor the accused. &#34;Made me fear the technology I once embraced and left me with a deep distrust of the cybersecurity protections and laws currently in place, now I know they can be exploited.&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;这些罪行使我感到不安全，＆＃34;据澳大利亚广播公司澳洲新闻社报道，受害人告诉法庭，该人既未提及受害人，也未提及被告。 ＆＃34;让我担心我曾经使用的技术，并让我对当前的网络安全保护和法律深表不信任，现在我知道它们可以被利用。</p><p> No federal laws regulate what automakers can collect or do with the vast majority of our driving data. The Driver Privacy Act of 2015 regulates a  vehicle&#39;s event data recorder, a computer that stores a snapshot of information from immediately before, during and after a crash. However, privacy activists are calling for protections to extend to data collected by many of the other computers in an automobile, including the infotainment system.</p><p> 没有联邦法律规定汽车制造商可以收集或处理我们绝大多数的驾驶数据。 2015年《驾驶员隐私法》对车辆事件数据记录器进行了规定，该计算机是存储事故发生之前，之中和之后的信息快照的计算机。但是，隐私权主义者呼吁保护范围扩大到汽车中许多其他计算机（包括信息娱乐系统）收集的数据。 </p><p> In 2016, the Federal Trade Commission  warned about the privacy risks associated with rental cars&#39; infotainment systems and said that unless user data is deleted, it will be &#34;accessible by third parties including future renters, rental car employees, or even hackers.&#34;</p><p>在2016年，联邦贸易委员会警告有关与租车有关的隐私风险。信息娱乐系统，并说除非删除用户数据，否则第三方（包括未来的租房者，租车员工甚至黑客）都可以访问该数据。</p><p> In May, a hacker known as GreenTheOnly showed how he could access personal details and passwords from buying  used infotainment computers for Tesla cars on eBay.</p><p> 今年5月，一个名叫GreenTheOnly的黑客向他展示了如何通过在eBay上为Tesla汽车购买二手信息娱乐计算机来访问个人详细信息和密码。</p><p>  He told the electric vehicle blog  InsideEVs that each of the modules he bought had &#34;owner&#39;s home and work location, all saved Wi-Fi passwords, calendar entries from the phone, call lists and address books from paired phones, Netflix and other stored session cookies.&#34;</p><p>  他告诉电动汽​​车博客InsideEVs，他购买的每个模块都有所有者的住所和工作地点，所有已保存的Wi-Fi密码，电话中的日历项，配对电话中的呼叫列表和地址簿，Netflix和其他存储的会话Cookie。＆＃34;</p><p> Fraudsters can use those kinds of data for identity theft, Amico said. He has been calling on automakers and leasing and rental companies to provide tools and services to routinely wipe a driver&#39;s information when a vehicle changes hands — similar to how data is wiped from recycled phones and laptops.</p><p> Amico说，欺诈者可以使用这些数据进行身份盗用。他一直在呼吁汽车制造商以及租赁和租赁公司提供工具和服务，以在汽车换手时定期擦除驾驶员的信息，这类似于如何从回收手机和笔记本电脑中擦除数据。</p><p> His company, Privacy4Cars, recently sent mystery shoppers to test-drive used cars at 72 dealerships. While they were in the vehicles, they checked the infotainment systems to see whether there was any remnant personal information from previous owners. Eighty-eight percent of the shoppers found personal data left on the vehicles, such as home addresses or phone numbers.</p><p> 他的公司Privacy4Cars最近派遣神秘购物者在72个经销店试驾了二手车。当他们在车上时，他们检查了信息娱乐系统，看是否有以前车主提供的剩余个人信息。 88％的购物者发现车辆上留下的个人数据，例如家庭住址或电话号码。</p><p> &#34;One of the most common crimes in the United States is identity theft. But even without that, would you be comfortable knowing that your home address, text messages, contacts and call history are all in someone else&#39;s hands?&#34; he asked.</p><p> ＆＃34;在美国最常见的犯罪之一是身份盗窃。但是即使没有这些，您是否也知道自己的家庭住址，短信，联系人和通话记录都掌握在别人的手中？他问。</p><p>  Prevette agreed, and he has changed his habits to protect himself. &#34;I don&#39;t sync my device to a rental car. I don&#39;t want all my contacts and phone numbers floating around out there,&#34; he said, although he noted that it required some technical skill to extract all of the data. &#34;There&#39;s a little bit of comfort knowing that.&#34;</p><p>  普雷维特同意了，他改变了习惯以保护自己。我不将我的设备同步到租车。我不希望我所有的联系方式和电话号码都在那附近徘徊，他说，尽管他指出提取所有数据需要一定的技术技能。知道这一点有些安慰。 </p><p> In the meantime, Ronald French&#39;s family has found that the data has brought them some consolation while the man accused of his murder sits in jail, Hamilton, his daughter,  told WOOD. &#34;We&#39;re just happy and relieved,&#34; she said. &#34;There were a lot of tears and cheers once we found out.&#34;</p><p>与此同时，罗纳德·法兰西（Ronald French）的家人发现，当被指控谋杀罪名的男子坐在监狱里时，数据给他们带来了一些安慰，他的女儿汉密尔顿告诉伍德。 ＆＃34;我们只是开心和放心，＆＃34; 她说。 ＆＃34;一旦发现，就会有很多的眼泪和欢呼声。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/snitches-wheels-police-turn-car-data-destroy-suspects-alibis-n1251939">https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/snitches-wheels-police-turn-car-data-destroy-suspects-alibis-n1251939</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/nbc/">#nbc</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/汽车/">#汽车</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
