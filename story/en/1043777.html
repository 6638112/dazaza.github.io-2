Ordinarily a live studio audience could be counted upon to holler and slap their hands together, but something was keeping them unusually subdued. The object of the audience’s awe was sitting at the center podium on the stage, looking rather unremarkable in his thrift-store shirt and slicked-back graying hair. His name was Michael Larson.</p><p>1984年5月19日，在好莱坞的哥伦比亚广播公司电视城，当受欢迎的游戏节目《按你的运气》（Press Your Luck）录制时，好奇的紧张气氛笼罩着工作室。通常情况下，可以指望现场录音室的观众欢呼并拍打他们的手，但是却使他们异常柔和。观众敬畏的对象是坐在舞台中央的讲台上，穿着他的旧货衬衫和光滑的白发看上去并不那么显眼。他的名字叫迈克尔·拉森。</p><p> “You’re going to go again?” asked the show’s host Peter Tomarken as Larson gesticulated. Gasps and murmurs punctuated the audience’s cautious applause, and the contestants sitting on either side of Larson clapped in stunned silence. “Michael’s going  again,” Tomarken announced incredulously. “We’ve never had anything like this before.”</p><p> “你要再去吗？”节目主持人彼得·托马肯（Peter Tomarken）问道，拉森示意了一下。观众的掌声雷动着，喘着粗气，杂乱无章的声音响起，坐在拉尔森两边的选手们都被震惊地拍了拍。 “迈克尔又去了，”托马克根不敢相信地宣布。 “我们以前从未有过这样的事情。”</p><p> The scoreboard on Larson’s podium read “$90,351,” an amount unheard of in the history of  Press Your Luck. In fact, this total was far greater than any person had ever earned in one sitting on any television game show. With each spin on the randomized “Big Board” Larson took a one-in-six chance of hitting a “Whammy” space that would strip him of all his spoils, yet for 36 consecutive spins he had somehow missed the whammies, stretched the show beyond its 30-minute format, and accumulated extraordinary winnings. Such a streak was astronomically unlikely, but Larson was not yet ready to stop. He was convinced that he knew exactly what he was doing.</p><p> 拉尔森（Larson）领奖台上的记分牌上写着“ 90,351美元”，这在“ Press Your Luck”的历史上是闻所未闻的。实际上，这一总数远远超过任何人在任何电视游戏节目中的收入。每次随机旋转“大板”时，拉森就有六分之一的机会击中“锤击”空间，这将剥夺他的所有战利品，但连续36次旋转，他都以某种方式错过了击锤声，延长了比赛时间超过了30分钟的播放时间，并累积了非凡的奖金。从天文学角度来看，这种连胜是不可能的，但是拉尔森还没有准备好停止。他确信自己完全知道自己在做什么。</p><p> Michael Larson was born in the small town of Lebanon, Ohio in 1949. Although he was generally regarded as creative and intelligent, he had an inexplicable preference for shady enterprises over gainful employment. One of his earliest exploits was in middle school, where he smuggled candy bars into class and profitably peddled them on the sly. This innocuous operation was just the first in a decreasingly scrupulous series of ventures. One of his later schemes involved opening a checking account with a bank that was offering a promotional $500 to each new customer; he would withdraw the cash at the earliest opportunity, close the account, then repeat the process over and over under assumed names.</p><p> 迈克尔·拉尔森（Michael Larson）1949年出生于俄亥俄州的黎巴嫩小镇。尽管他通常被认为是有创造力和才智的人，但他对遮荫企业而不是有酬工作有着莫名其妙的偏爱。他最早的功勋之一是在中学时期，在那里他把糖果酒吧走私到了班上，然后偷偷地兜售糖果。这种无害的操作只是一系列越来越严格的冒险中的第一个。他后来的计划之一是在一家银行开一个支票帐户，该帐户向每位新客户提供500美元的促销金；他会尽早提取现金，关闭帐户，然后以假名重复一遍又一遍。</p><p>  On another occasion he created a fake business under a family member’s name, hired himself as an employee, then laid himself off to collect unemployment wages.</p><p>  在其他情况下，他以家庭成员的名义开办了一家假公司，雇用自己为雇员，然后解雇自己以领取失业工资。</p><p> By 1983 Michael Larson had been married and divorced twice and was living with his girlfriend Teresa Dinwitty. During the summers he operated a Mister Softee ice cream truck, and during the off-season he passed the time poring through piles of periodicals in search of money-making schemes. Michael also spent much of the day with his console television, scanning the airwaves for lucrative opportunities. One day it occurred to him that he could double his information intake by setting a second console TV to beside the first and tuning it to a different channel. Soon he procured a third. Eventually he added a row of smaller televisions atop the three consoles, and yet another row of tubes was later stacked atop that. Now he could watch 12 channels at once.</p><p> 到1983年，迈克尔·拉森（Michael Larson）已婚和离婚两次，并与女友特蕾莎·丁威蒂（Teresa Dinwitty）住在一起。夏季，他操作了Softee先生的冰淇淋卡车，在淡季中，他度过了漫长的时光，遍历大量期刊以寻找赚钱的计划。迈克尔在整天的大部分时间里都在控制台电视上看电视，寻找有利可图的机会。有一天，他想到可以通过将第二台控制台电视设置在第一台控制台电视旁边并将其调谐到另一个频道来使信息接收量增加一倍。不久，他获得了三分之一。最终，他在三个调音台的顶部增加了一排较小的电视，后来又在那上面放了一排电子管。现在，他可以一次观看12个频道。</p><p> The warm, buzzing television tumor metastasized into adjacent rooms, filling the house with a goulash of infomercials, news programs, game shows, and advertisements for money-making schemes. Larson watched them in a trance-like state, sometimes throughout the night. Dinwitty would later say of her boyfriend and common-law husband, “He always thought he was smarter than everybody else,” and that he had a “constant yearning for knowledge.” But when visitors asked about the chattering mass of receivers she found it easier to just tell them that Michael was crazy.</p><p> 温暖，嗡嗡作响的电视肿瘤转移到相邻的房间里，使整个屋子里充满了信息商业，新闻节目，游戏节目和赚钱计划广告的信息。拉尔森（Larson）有时整夜都看着他们处于tr状态。丁威蒂后来对她的男朋友和同居伴侣说：“他一直以为自己比其他任何人都聪明。”而且，他对知识有“不变的向往”。但是，当访问者询问大量的接收者时，她发现告诉他们迈克尔已经疯了很容易。 </p><p> One fateful November day in 1983, Peter Tomarken’s dapper countenance appeared on one of Michael’s many monitors. Tomarken was the host of a new game show called  Press Your Luck which was giving away more money than any other game shows at the time. What most interested Michael was the game’s “Big Board,” an electronic array of prize boxes which operated by lighting up squares in a rapid and random fashion until the player pressed a big red button to stop the action. The player’s randomly selected box might contain a vacation, a prize, cash rewards, and/or extra spins. But with each spin there was also a one-in-six chance of hitting a Whammy which would cause an animated character to appear on the screen and expunge all of a player’s winnings.</p><p>1983年11月是一个决定性的日子，彼得·托马肯（Peter Tomarken）轻巧的面容出现在迈克尔众多的监视器之一上。 Tomarken是一个名为Press Your Luck的新游戏节目的主持人，该节目比当时的任何其他游戏节目提供的钱都多。迈克尔最感兴趣的是游戏的“大板”（Big Board），这是一组电子奖励盒，通过快速随机地点亮方块直到玩家按下红色大按钮停止操作来操作。玩家随机选择的框可能包含休假，奖品，现金奖励和/或额外旋转。但是每次旋转都会有六分之一的机会击中Whammy，这将使动画角色出现在屏幕上并消除所有玩家的赢利。</p><p>  Larson invested in a newfangled video cassette recorder and began taping episodes of  Press Your Luck. After weeks of painstaking scrutiny Michael realized that the bouncing prize selector did not actually move randomly; it always followed one of five lengthy sequences. This information was only moderately useful due to the rapidly shuffling positions of the prizes and penalties, but his methodical analysis led to another finding. Of the eighteen squares on the Big Board there were two that never had Whammies: #4 and #8. This meant that all a player must do to avoid Whammies⁠—and thus retain his hundreds of dollars in winnings⁠—would be to memorize five interminable series of numbers and develop superhuman reflexes. Giddy with the thrill of discovery, Larson began fine-tuning his timing using his VCR’s pause key as a surrogate big red button.</p><p>  拉尔森（Larson）投资了一台新式的盒式磁带录像机，并开始录制《 Press Your Luck》的剧集。经过数周的细心检查，迈克尔意识到弹跳奖品的选择者实际上并没有随机移动。它始终遵循五个冗长序列之一。由于奖金和罚金的快速改组，该信息仅适度有用，但是他的方法分析导致了另一个发现。大木板上的18个方格中有两个从未有过Whammies的方格：＃4和＃8。这意味着所有玩家必须做的是避免Whammies，从而保留他的数百美元奖金，这将是为了记住五个无穷无尽的数字序列并发展超人反应。随着发现的兴奋，吉迪（Giddy）开始使用VCR的暂停键作为替代的大红色按钮来调整时间。</p><p> Six months later, in May 1984, Michael Larson sat beardily in the interview room for the  Press Your Luck auditions in Hollywood. His story left few heartstrings unpulled: He explained that he was an unemployed ice cream truck driver. He had borrowed the bus money to get to Hollywood from Ohio because he loved  Press Your Luck. He had stopped at a thrift store down the street to buy a 65 cent dress shirt. And he was unable to afford a gift for his six-year-old daughter’s upcoming birthday. Executive producer Bill Carruthers said of Larson’s audition, “He really impressed us. He had charisma.” Contestant coordinator Bob Edwards was uneasy about Larson, but he couldn’t quite articulate why, so Bill overruled him. “I should have listened to Bob,” Carruthers later chuckled.</p><p> 六个月后，即1984年5月，迈克尔·拉尔森（Michael Larson）呆呆地坐在采访室里，接受好莱坞的《 Press Your Luck》试镜。他的故事留下了几句不解之谜：他解释说自己是一名失业的冰淇淋卡车司机。他借了公共汽车钱从俄亥俄州去好莱坞，因为他喜欢“按你的运气”。他曾在街上的一家旧货店停下来买一件65美分的正装衬衫。而且，他无法为他六岁的女儿即将到来的生日提供礼物。执行制片人比尔·卡鲁瑟斯（Bill Carruthers）在谈到拉森的试镜时说：“他的确给我们留下了深刻的印象。他很有魅力。”竞赛协调员鲍勃·爱德华兹（Bob Edwards）对拉尔森（Larson）感到不安，但他不清楚原因，因此比尔（Bill）推翻了他。 “我应该听鲍勃的，”卡鲁瑟斯笑着说。</p><p> Taping occurred the following Saturday. Returning champion Ed Long sat on Michael’s right and contestant Janie Litras sat on his left. Host Peter Tomarken made boilerplate game-showey chit-chat with each contestant, and he asked Michael about his ice cream truck. “You’ve kind of OD’d on ice cream, right?” he asked Larson, who agreed. “Well hopefully you won’t OD on money, Michael.”</p><p> 录音在下一个星期六发生。回归冠军埃德·朗（Ed Long）坐在迈克尔的右边，而参赛者珍妮·里特拉斯（Janie Litras）坐在他的左边。主持人彼得·托马肯（Peter Tomarken）与每位参赛者进行样板游戏-花花公子聊天，然后他向迈克尔询问了他的冰淇淋车。 “你有点想吃冰淇淋吧？”他问拉森，他同意了。 “希望您不会花钱，迈克尔。”</p><p> Michael earned 3 spins on the Big Board in the first question round, giving him 3 opportunities to test the skills he had cultivated over the past six months. The board’s incandescent selector began its distinctive pseudo-random maneuvers. “Come on…big bucks,” Michael chanted, as was customary for players when up against the Big Board. “STOP!” he shouted as he slapped the button with both hands. The selector was stopped on a Whammy in slot #17. Michael shook his head and forced an embarrassed smile, but now he knew exactly how the board was timed with respect to the button. With his second and third spins Michael found his stride. He dropped all pretenses and remained silent as he concentrated on the light bouncing around the big board. Both times he successfully landed on space #4, and he ended the first half of the game with $2,500.</p><p> 在第一个问题回合中，Michael在“大董事会”上获得了3次旋转，这使他有3次机会测试过去六个月中培养的技能。董事会的白炽灯选择器开始了其独特的伪随机操作。 “快来……大钱，” Michael喊道，这是与Big Board对抗时玩家的惯常做法。 “停！”他用双手拍击按钮时大喊。选择器停在＃17槽中的Whammy上。迈克尔摇了摇头，露出尴尬的笑容，但现在他确切地知道董事会在按钮方面的时机了。在第二次和第三次旋转中，迈克尔发现了自己的步伐。当他专注于大板周围弹跳的灯光时，他放下了所有的姿势，保持沉默。两次他都成功登陆了4号空间，并以2500美元结束了比赛的上半场。</p><p>  In the second and more lucrative half of the game, Michael managed to acquire seven spins to use on the big board. Since he was in last place he was the first to spin. He positioned his hands over the button with interlocked fingers and impatiently interrupted the host’s banter by shouting, “I’m ready, I’m ready!” Tomarken indulged him, and the light on the big board began bouncing. Again, Larson was silent as he frowned at the board. Fellow contestant Ed Long would later say of Larson during these moments that “he went into a trance.”</p><p>  在游戏的第二部分和更有利可图的一半中，Michael设法获得了7次旋转以用于大型董事会。由于他排在最后，所以他是第一个旋转的人。他用互锁的手指将手放在按钮上，不耐烦地大喊：“我准备好了，我准备好了！”托马克根放纵了他，大板上的灯开始弹起。拉森再次皱着眉头，沉默了。参赛选手埃德·朗（Ed Long）后来在这些时刻对拉森说：“他陷入了tr。”</p><p> Thus began Larson’s inconceivable procession of winning spins. His demeanor alternated between intense concentration and jubilation. The strategy worked even better than he had anticipated due to the large number of Free Spin bonuses that appeared in his safe slots. Host Peter Tomarken became increasingly flabbergasted each time Larson made the “spin again” gesture. $30,000 was considered an extraordinary payoff for one day on any game show at that time, and the likelihood of missing the whammies for more than a dozen spins was considered to be vanishingly small. By his 13th spin Michael had $32,351 and nervous giggles. By his 21st spin he had $47,601 and conspicuous anxiety. But he pressed on.</p><p> 拉尔森（Larson）赢得旋转的不可思议的游行由此开始。他的举止在专心致志和欢欣鼓舞之间交替出现。该策略的效果甚至比他预期的还要好，这是由于在他的安全位置上出现了大量免费旋转奖金。每当Larson做出“再次旋转”手势时，主持人Peter Tomarken都会变得越来越沮丧。在当时的任何游戏节目中，30,000美元都被认为是一天之内的一笔不菲收益，而错过12次以上旋转击打的可能性被认为很小。到他的第13次旋转时，Michael有了$ 32,351的收入，并且有些咯咯笑。到他的第21次旋转时，他有$ 47,601和明显的焦虑感。但是他继续前进。 </p><p> The  Press Your Luck control booth had grown silent as the show’s producers began to realize that Larson was consistently winning on the same two spaces. In a panic, the booth operators called Michael Brockman, CBS’s head of daytime programming. “Something was very wrong,” Brockman said in a  TV Guide interview. “Here was this guy from nowhere, and he was hitting the bonus box every time. It was bedlam, I can tell you.” Producers asked if they should stop the show, but Larson did not appear to be breaking any rules so they were forced to allow the episode to play out.</p><p>节目的制片人开始意识到，拉尔森（Larson）一直在两个相同的领域中取胜，因此“ Press Your Luck”控制室变得沉默寡言。惊慌失措的是，展位运营商叫CBS白天节目负责人Michael Brockman。布罗克曼在接受《电视指南》采访时说：“事情很不对劲。” “这是一个无处不在的家伙，他每次都击中奖金框。我可以告诉你，那是疯子。”制片人询问是否应该停止演出，但拉尔森似乎没有违反任何规定，因此他们被迫允许播放该剧集。</p><p> Back on the stage, Ed and Janie clapped incredulously on either side of Michael, still waiting for their turns on the board. Janie let slip a snort of disgust after Michael’s 26th successful spin. Tomarken covered his face with his hand in disbelief as Larson risked almost $75k on his 32nd spin. But Michael’s zen-like concentration was beginning to falter. He paused to set his head on the podium and let out a whimper of exhaustion. Still he motioned to continue. The studio audience worried that he’d hit a whammy and experience an unfortunate reversal of fortune, while the producers in the control booth worried that he wouldn’t.</p><p> 回到舞台上，Ed和Janie难以置信地在Michael的每一侧鼓掌，仍在等待他们在董事会上的转机。迈克尔（Michael）第26次成功旋转后，珍妮（Janie）let之以鼻。 Tomarken难以置信地遮住了脸，因为Larson在第32次旋转时冒着将近$ 75k的风险。但是迈克尔像禅宗一样的专注开始动摇了。他停下来将自己的头放在讲台上，发出疲惫的声音。他仍然动议继续。制片厂的观众担心他会被打击，经历不幸的命运逆转，而控制室的制片人则担心他不会这样做。</p><p> On his 40th spin Larson’s scoreboard debt-clocked his dollar sign to make room for another digit; he surpassed $100,000. Larson, his shoulders slumped, passed his remaining spins to the bewildered Ed Long. Ed immediately hit a whammy.</p><p> 拉森（Larson）在第40次旋转时，在记分板上负债累累了​​他的美元符号，以腾出另一位数。他超过了$ 100,000。拉尔森的肩膀低落，将剩下的旋转传递给了困惑的埃德·朗。埃德立即受到打击。</p><p>  Michael sat in a twitchy daze as Ed and Janie went through their much more pedestrian turns at the board. But Larson was snapped back to reality when Janie passed 3 of her spins to him. According to the game rules he was obligated to use them. He did not appear pleased.</p><p>  埃德（Ed）和珍妮（Janie）在董事会上经过更多行人转弯时，迈克尔（Michael）抽搐着发呆。但是当珍妮（Janie）将自己的3次旋转传递给他时，拉尔森（Larson）迅速回到了现实。根据游戏规则，他有义务使用它们。他不高兴。</p><p> “I didn’t want them,” Larson joked nervously as the light began bouncing around the big board, yet almost immediately he punched the big red button and landed on $4,000 in slot #4. Janie let out a squeal. The board started again. After a longer than usual delay, Larson hit the button again, landing safely in slot #8. He had just one mandatory spin remaining. The board started flashing, and Larson let out a sigh. “STOP!” he shouted as he slapped the button, but he had pressed it a fraction of a second too soon. Slot #17 was lit, the same slot where he’d hit a whammy on his first spin. As luck would have it, however, the slot contained a trip to the Bahamas. It was over; Michael had won. Larson gave Ed an awkward embrace and offered Janie a firm handshake. In total, Larson won $110,237 in cash and prizes, including two tropical vacations and a sailboat. Reportedly this was more than triple the previous record for winnings in a single episode of a game show.</p><p> “我不想他们，”拉森紧张地开玩笑，光线开始在大板上弹起，但几乎立即他按下了红色的大按钮，落在了＃4的$ 4,000位置。珍妮发出尖叫声。董事会再次开始。经过比平常更长的延迟后，Larson再次按下按钮，安全降落在＃8插槽中。他只剩下一个强制旋转。董事会开始闪烁，拉森发出一声叹息。 “停！”当他拍打按钮时，他喊道，但是他按下按钮的时间太短了。第17号槽点灯了，与他第一次旋转时被击打的位置相同。然而，幸运的是，该时段包含了前往巴哈马的旅行。结束了；迈克尔赢了。拉尔森（Larson）拥抱了埃德（Ed）一个尴尬的拥抱，并与珍妮（坚尼）握手。 Larson总共赢得了110,237美元的现金和奖品，包括两次热带假期和一艘帆船。据报道，这是游戏节目单集获奖记录的三倍多。</p><p> A clearly discombobulated Peter Tomarken engaged Larson in an impromptu interview after the show. “Why did you keep going?” he asked.</p><p> 演出结束后，明显疏离的彼得·托马克（Peter Tomarken）与拉森进行了即兴采访。 “你为什么继续前进？”他问。</p><p> “Well, two things:” Michael replied. “One, it felt right. And second, I still had seven spins and if I passed them, somebody could have done what I did.”</p><p> “好，两件事：”迈克尔回答。 “一个，感觉不错。其次，我仍然有7次旋转，如果我通过了，那么有人可以做我所做的事情。” </p><p> Tomarken was too polite to remark on the ridiculousness of that suggestion. “What are you going to do with the money, Michael?”</p><p>Tomarken太客气了，以至于没有评论这个建议的荒谬之处。 “迈克尔，你打算怎么处理这笔钱？”</p><p>  Larson was not allowed to return as champion since he had surpassed CBS’s $25k winnings limit. As all of the perplexed parties parted ways, CBS executives were called to a meeting to dissect the episode frame-by-frame. In spite of their efforts they could find no evidence of wrongdoing or rule-breaking, so after a few weeks they grudgingly mailed Larson his check. Some people at CBS didn’t want the over-extended episode to be released to the public at all, but it was ultimately decided to air it in June as an awkwardly edited two-parter.</p><p>  Larson被禁止返回冠军，因为他已经超过了CBS的$ 25k奖金限额。当所有困惑的各方分道扬，时，CBS高管被召集开会，逐帧剖析该情节。尽管他们付出了很大的努力，但他们找不到错误或违反规则的证据，因此几周后，他们勉强地将拉森的支票寄给了拉尔森。 CBS的某些人根本不希望将扩展时间过的一集发布给公众，但最终决定在6月以尴尬的两部分内容播出。</p><p>  Executives insisted that the episode never be seen again. In the meantime  Press Your Luck paid to add some more sequences to the Big Board to prevent future contestants from mimicking Michael’s strategy.</p><p>  高管们坚持认为这一情节再也看不到了。同时，Press Your Luck支付了费用，在Big Board上添加了更多序列，以防止未来的参赛者模仿Michael的策略。</p><p> Upon his return home, neighbors were shocked to learn of “crazy” Michael Larson’s accomplishment. True to his word, he regaled his daughter with expensive birthday gifts and invested some of his spoils in real estate. But his fondness for dicey get-rich-quick deals ensnared him in a Ponzi scheme, and he lost enough money to lose his appetite for houses.</p><p> 他回到家后，邻居震惊地得知迈克尔·拉尔森（Michael Larson）的成就。忠实于他的诺言，他用昂贵的生日礼物给女儿致敬，并将他的一些赃物投资于房地产。但是，他对迪基迅速致富的热爱使他陷入了庞氏骗局，而且他损失了足够的钱，失去了对房屋的胃口。</p><p> Some months later Michael Larson saw another opportunity to stack the odds in his favor with a dash of ingenuity. He walked into his bank one day and asked to withdraw his entire account balance, but with an unusual stipulation: He wanted as much of the cash as possible in one dollar notes. The bank complied with his unorthodox request, and from there he proceeded to another bank to trade even more of his savings for singles. Over a two week period he converted the $100,000 or so that remained of his personal savings into 100,000 one dollar bills.</p><p> 几个月后，迈克尔·拉尔森（Michael Larson）看到了另一个机会，以一点点机巧将几率提高到他的偏爱。一天，他走进银行，要求提取全部帐户余额，但有一个不寻常的规定：他想要尽可能多的现金以一美元面额的钞票支付。该银行遵守了他的非正统要求，然后从那里前往另一家银行，将更多的积蓄交易为单身人士。在两周的时间里，他将这100,000美元左右的个人储蓄余额转换为100,000张一美元的钞票。</p><p> The motivation for this aberrant behavior was a contest put on by a local radio station. Each day a disk jockey would read a serial number aloud on the air, and if any listener was able to produce the matching dollar bill they would win $30,000. Michael reasoned that 100,000 one dollar bills was 100,000 opportunities to win the prize, giving him a statistical advantage. And even if his scheme proved fruitless he would just redeposit his money, so he figured he had nothing to lose.</p><p> 这种异常行为的动机是由当地一家广播电台发起的竞赛。每天，一位唱片骑师都会在空中大声读出一个序列号，如果有听众能够出示相符的美金，他们将赢得30,000美元。迈克尔认为，100,000美元的面额的钞票有100,000个获胜的机会，这给了他统计学上的优势。即使他的计划证明是徒劳的，他也只会重新存钱，所以他认为自己没有损失。</p><p> Michael and Teresa spent each day rifling through piles of cash looking for matches, pausing only for such distractions as eating, bathing, and excreting. They soon realized that it was impossible for two people to examine that much money in the allotted time, so Michael redeposited a portion of it. After a few weeks, Michael’s obsession over the contest began to put considerable strain on his relationship with Teresa, and on his relationship with reality. The cash was stashed in kitchen drawers, up the stairs, and on bedroom floors. They kept the bills in burlap sacks, grocery bags, and unkempt stacks. And though his girlfriend would scream and shout, he simply would not take the cash bags out.</p><p> 迈克尔和特雷莎每天都花大笔钱来寻找比赛，只因为吃饭，洗澡和排泄物等干扰而暂停。他们很快意识到，两个人不可能在规定的时间内检查那么多钱，所以迈克尔重新存了一部分钱。几周后，迈克尔对比赛的痴迷开始使他与特蕾莎修女的关系以及与现实的关系受到很大的压力。现金被藏在厨房的抽屉里，楼梯上和卧室的地板上。他们把钞票放在粗麻布袋，食品袋和乱蓬蓬的书包中。尽管他的女友会尖叫和大喊，但他根本不会把现金袋拿出来。 </p><p>  One evening, seeking refuge from the endless hours of cash-collating, Michael and Teresa accepted an invitation to attend a Christmas party. When they returned home at about 1:00 am, they found the back door of the house had been brutalized. Apparently the pair had unwittingly left a sizable tip for an unsolicited cleaning service: about $50,000. According to Dinwitty, Michael immediately accused her of being an accessory to the heist. She denied involvement, and police found no evidence of her guilt, but she says that Larson was never convinced. She claimed that Michael would stand and stare at her while she slept, which made her fear for her safety. One day while Michael was away she took $5,000 that he had hidden in a dresser drawer and absconded with the kids. She called him from a hotel to tell him to move out of her house. His only response was, “I want my money back.” He packed his belongings and departed, leaving one wall of the living room blemished and peeling from the heat of his once-formidable tower of televisions.</p><p>一天晚上，迈克尔和特雷莎在无休止的现金整理工作中寻求庇护，接受了参加圣诞节派对的邀请。当他们大约在凌晨1:00返家时，他们发现房子的后门遭到了残酷的对待。显然，这对夫妇不知不觉地留下了一笔不菲的小费，用于不请自来的清洁服务：约50,000美元。根据丁威蒂（Dinwitty）的说法，迈克尔立即指控她是抢劫案的助手。她否认参与，警方也没有发现自己有罪的证据，但她说拉尔森从未被说服。她声称迈克尔在睡觉时会站起来凝视她，这使她担心自己的安全。一天，迈克尔不在时，她拿走了5,000美元，他藏在梳妆台的抽屉里，与孩子们一起潜逃。她从旅馆给他打电话，告诉他要搬出她的房子。他唯一的回答是：“我要我的钱还给我。”他收拾行装，离开，离开客厅的一堵墙，从他曾经成型的电视塔的热量中剥落了。</p><p> Police never identified the thieves. In 1994, about 10 years after his pivotal  Press Your Luck appearance, Larson was invited to be a guest on ABC’s  Good Morning America to discuss the movie  Quiz Show. With a raspy voice he unbeardily reminisced about his game show exploits and expressed regret that he was never able to play on Jeopardy, because, he explained, “I think I have figured out some angles on that.” Around that same time he was also interviewed by  TV Guide magazine. When asked about the whereabouts of his  Press Your Luck winnings, he replied, “It didn’t work out. We had a cash-flow problem, and I lost everything.”</p><p> 警方从未发现小偷。 1994年，在他的举足轻重的Press Your Luck出现大约10年之后，Larson受邀成为ABC的《早安美国》的嘉宾，讨论电影Quiz Show。他用草率的声音毫不留情地回想起自己的游戏秀功绩，并对他永远无法参加《危险游戏》表示遗憾，因为他解释说：“我想我已经对此有所了解。”大约在同一时间，他还接受了《电视指南》杂志的采访。当被问及他的“按Your运”赢家的去向时，他回答说：“没有成功。我们遇到了现金流问题，我输了一切。”</p><p> In March of the following year, Michael fled from Ohio with agents from the SEC, IRS, and FBI hot on his heels. He was implicated as one of the architects of a cash-flow solution that operated under the name Pleasure Time Incorporated. It was a pyramid scam selling shares in a fraudulent “American Indian Lottery” which had hoodwinked 20,000 investors out of 3 million dollars. The Pleasure Time flimflam was historic in that it was the first time the SEC pursued a case where the bulk of the fraud took place in newfangled “cyberspace.” Michael Larson was a fugitive from justice for four years until 1999, when he turned up in Apopka, Florida. He had succumbed to throat cancer.</p><p> 次年3月，迈克尔与SEC，IRS和FBI的经纪人一起从俄亥俄州逃离。他被认为是现金流解决方案的架构师之一，该解决方案以Pleasure Time Incorporated的名义运营。这是一个金字塔骗局，出售了欺诈性的“美洲印第安人彩票”的股份，该骗局从300万美元中骗走了20,000名投资者。 Fleasure Time flimflam具有悠久的历史，因为这是SEC首次进行诉讼，其中大部分欺诈行为都发生在新型的“网络空间”中。迈克尔·拉森（Michael Larson）是逃犯的四年，直到1999年他在佛罗里达州的阿波普卡（Apopka）出道。他屈从于喉癌。</p><p>  Michael Larson held the record for the most game-show winnings in a single day until 2006, when it was broken by Vickyann Chrobak-Sadowski on  The Price is Right. Larson’s handiwork on  Press Your Luck was sufficiently extraordinary that he has become a strange kind of folk hero to some. Others regard him as a cheap huckster or a likable-but-occasionally-creepy crackpot. The real Michael Larson was arguably an amalgam of these qualities. His shenanigans on  Press Your Luck are oft described as a “scam,” “scandal,” or a “cheat,” but even the CBS executives ultimately admitted that he had broken nary a rule. In the end, his impressive performance on  Press Your Luck may be one of the only honest days of work that Michael Larson ever did.</p><p>  直到2006年，迈克尔·拉尔森（Michael Larson）都保持了单场最多游戏收入的纪录，直到2006年，维克扬·克罗巴克·萨多夫斯基（Vickyann Chrobak-Sadowski）打破了《 The Price is Right》。拉尔森（Larson）在《按Your好运》（Press Your Luck）上的手法十分出色，以至于他成为某些人的一种奇怪的民间英雄。其他人则认为他是便宜的混蛋或讨人喜欢的但偶尔令人毛骨悚然的crackpot。真正的迈克尔·拉森可以说是这些品质的结合体。他在《按Your运》上的恶作剧经常被描述为“骗局”，“丑闻”或“作弊”，但即使是哥伦比亚广播公司的高管们最终也承认他违反了任何规则。最后，他在《 Press Your Luck》上令人印象深刻的表现可能是Michael Larson曾经做过的仅有的诚实的日子之一。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.damninteresting.com/who-wants-to-be-a-thousandaire/">https://www.damninteresting.com/who-wants-to-be-a-thousandaire/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/成为/">#成为</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/larson/">#larson</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
