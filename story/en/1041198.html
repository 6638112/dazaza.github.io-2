Gov. Ron DeSantis said her firing was because she disobeyed superiors; she said it was because she wouldn&#39;t alter data to cast Florida in a more favorable light to justify the governor&#39;s plans to reopen the state&#39;s economy.</p><p> 琼斯在五月份被解雇，并很快启动了自己的在线数据仪表板。州长罗恩·德桑蒂斯（Ron DeSantis）说，开除是因为她不服从上级。她说这是因为她不会更改数据以更有利的方式投向佛罗里达州，以证明州长重新开放该州经济的计划是合理的。</p><p> In the lawsuit filed Sunday night against FDLE Commissioner Rick Swearingen, the department and several agents in Leon County Circuit Civil Court, Jones claims her constitutional rights were violated, including against unlawful search and seizure. She is seeking in excess of $100,000, according to the lawsuit&#39;s cover sheet.</p><p> 在周日晚上针对FDLE专员Rick Swearingen，部门和莱昂县巡回民事法院的几名代理人提起的诉讼中，琼斯声称侵犯了她的宪法权利，包括对非法搜身和没收的行为。根据诉讼书的封面，她要价超过10万美元。</p><p>  &#34;We are trying to achieve some kind of redress,&#34; said Rick Johnson, the lead attorney in both the civil suit and a separate whistleblower case. &#34;This is still America. This is the kind of thing that happens in tinhorn dictatorships in third world countries.&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;我们正在努力实现某种补救，＆＃34;民事诉讼和另一个举报人案件的首席律师里克·约翰逊（Rick Johnson）说。 ＆＃34;这仍然是美国。这是在第三世界国家的丁豪号独裁统治中发生的事情。</p><p>   Swearingen has defended the actions of the agents he said were &#34;vilified&#34; by the media. He blamed Jones for any risk of danger to herself or her family. He reiterated those comments in a statement released later Monday.</p><p>   斯伯林根为代理人的行为辩护，他说这些代理人被“侮辱”了。通过媒体。他指责琼斯可能对自己或家人造成危险。他在周一晚些时候发表的声明中重申了这些评论。</p><p> “ As I have said before, I am proud of the professionalism shown by our FDLE agents as they served a legal search warrant on the residence of Rebekah Jones. Our criminal investigation continues, and while I have not seen this lawsuit, I believe the facts will come out in court,” Swearingen said.</p><p> “正如我之前说过的，我为我们的FDLE代理商所表现出的专业精神感到自豪，因为他们在Rebekah Jones的住所提供了合法的搜查令。我们的刑事调查仍在继续，虽然我没有看到这桩诉讼，但我相信事实会在法庭上公布。”</p><p>       FDLE agents accompanied by Tallahassee Police officers arrived at 7:30 a.m. Dec. 7 to serve a search warrant on Jones&#39;s home in connection with an investigation of a security breach of a state Health Department emergency communication network.</p><p>       FDLE特工在12月7日上午7:30到达塔拉哈西警察陪同下，在琼斯家中提供搜查令，以调查州卫生部门紧急通信网络的安全漏洞。 </p><p> The FDLE said it took more than 20 minutes for Jones to open the door after they began knocking. Her lawyer, Johnson, said she was still in bed when the agents started knocking, and had to get dressed, wake up her children and call her attorney.</p><p>FDLE说，琼斯开始敲门后，琼斯打开门花了20多分钟。她的律师约翰逊（Johnson）说，当特工开始敲门，必须换衣服，叫醒孩子并打电话给律师时，她仍在床上。</p><p>  &#34;She thought she was going to be arrested,&#34; Johnson said. The video shows that shortly after they said they had a warrant, Jones opened the door. The lawsuit said she opened the door 39 seconds after they first said they had a warrant.</p><p>  ＆＃34;她以为自己将要被捕，＆＃34;约翰逊说。视频显示，在他们说有认股权证后不久，琼斯开了门。诉讼说，在他们首先说他们有逮捕令后39秒钟，她打开了门。</p><p> &#34;If they are pounding on the door without mentioning a warrant of any kind to arrest or search, a citizen doesn&#39;t have to open the door to police,&#34; Johnson said.</p><p> 如果他们在敲门时没有提及任何逮捕或搜查令，则公民不必向警察敞开大门，＆＃34;约翰逊说。</p><p> According to the state, an unauthorized user snuck onto the network and sent out a text message to 1,750 recipients that said:  &#34;It&#39;s time to speak up before another 17,000 people are dead. You know this is wrong. You don&#39;t have to be a part of this. Be a hero. Speak out before it&#39;s too late.&#34;</p><p> 根据该州，未经授权的用户偷偷进入网络，并向1,750名收件人发送了一条短信，说：是时候让另外17,000人死亡之前大声说出来了。您知道这是错误的。您不必参与其中。成为英雄。在为时已晚之前大声说出来。</p><p>  What&#39;s known as the &#34;ESF-8&#34; account is the state&#39;s emergency support function for public health and medical services and is used by people from several agencies, including Health and Emergency Management.</p><p>  称为＆＃34; ESF-8＆＃34;帐户是国家为公共卫生和医疗服务提供的紧急支持功能，供包括卫生和应急管理在内的多个机构的人员使用。</p><p> Jones, who has not been charged with a crime, denies she hacked into the account, which had its user name and password posted on a public website until state officials took it down four days after the raid.</p><p> 琼斯没有被指控犯罪，但否认她入侵了该帐户，该帐户的用户名和密码已在公共网站上发布，直到州官员在突袭后四天将其取下为止。</p><p>  Her lawyers were unable to get DeSantis, DOH, nor FDLE to produce any rule, policy or classification that made this emergency alert system restricted anyway, the complaint says. They doubt there would have been a crime anyway, because DOH basically gave an open invitation to anyone to access it.</p><p>  投诉说，她的律师无法让DeSantis，DOH和FDLE产生任何规则，政策或分类，从而使该紧急警报系统受到限制。他们怀疑无论如何都会犯罪，因为DOH基本上是向任何人公开发出访问邀请。 </p><p> &#34;You don’t get sued for trespassing when you walk into Publix, and you don’t need to knock or ask permission when you enter,&#34; Johnson said. &#34;That’s the gist of what this is like.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34;走进Publix时，您不会因擅闯而被起诉，进入时也无需敲门或寻求许可，＆＃34;约翰逊说。 ＆＃34;这就是它的本质。＆＃34;</p><p>  Additionally, Johnson said, there is no explanation or detail of the &#34;investigative resources&#34; the FDLE agent who applied for the search warrant mentioned in his affidavit used to obtain Jones&#39;s IP address or that it could be easily spoofed. The suit said he ignored the body of law and scientific opinion finding an IP address insufficient on its own to justify a search warrant.</p><p>  此外，约翰逊说，“调查资源”没有任何解释或细节。申请宣誓书中提到的搜查令的FDLE代理人曾经获得过琼斯的IP地址，或者很容易被欺骗。诉讼称，他无视法律和科学意见，认为仅靠IP地址不足以证明搜查令是合理的。</p><p> &#34;FDLE, seeking to ingratiate itself to DeSantis, sought to silence Plaintiff&#39;s online speech by confiscating her computer and to discover her confidential sources, and other information by seizing her cell phone,&#34; the suit says.</p><p> FDLE试图向DeSantis表示祝贺，并试图通过没收她的计算机来沉默原告的在线讲话，并通过扣押她的手机来发现她的机密消息来源和其他信息，＆＃34;西装说。</p><p> A video camera set up by Jones and pointed at the front door shows agents entering the house with sidearms unholstered and drawn. An agent points his gun up the stairs as he calls for Jones&#39;s husband and two children to come down.</p><p> 琼斯安装并指向前门的摄像机显示，特工带着没有装饰和拉动的侧臂进入房屋。一名探员呼吁琼斯的丈夫和两个孩子下来时，他的枪指着楼梯。</p><p> &#34;They entered her home with guns drawn, terrorizing her family,&#34; the complaint says. &#34;They were there to execute a search warrant for her electronic devices; however the basis of the warrant was a sham to punish plaintiff for Plaintiff&#39;s protected speech.&#34;</p><p> 他们带着枪支进入她的家，使她的家人感到恐惧，＆＃34;投诉说。 ＆＃34;他们在那里为她的电子设备执行搜查令；但是，逮捕令的依据是虚假地惩罚原告的受保护言论。</p><p>  Tallahassee lawyer Stephen S. Dobson, who also represents Jones and will be her criminal defense lawyer if charged, says he sent a letter to the FDLE, telling them the files the agency took from her are privileged attorney-client communications and work product.</p><p>  塔拉哈西律师史蒂芬·多布森（Stephen Dobson）也是琼斯的代理人，如果被起诉将成为她的刑事辩护律师。他说，他致信FDLE，告诉他们该机构从她那里获得的文件是律师与客户之间的特权交流和工作成果。</p><p> Dobson, who spent 15 years with the state law enforcement agency, said he was disappointed by what he saw.</p><p> 在国家执法机构工作了15年的多布森（Dobson）说，他对自己所看到的感到失望。 </p><p> &#34;This is, if anything, you&#39;re looking for a computer and they came in with guns drawn and pointing up the stairs and at her children,&#34; Dobson said. &#34;It&#39;s really overreach by the FDLE.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34;这是（如果有的话）您正在寻找一台计算机，他们带着枪支进来，并指着楼梯和她的孩子，＆＃34;多布森说。 FDLE确实超出了范围。</p><p>  Videos of body camera footage released by the FDLE shows a Tallahassee police officer at Jones&#39;s door with a sledgehammer in hand, and another law enforcement officer with his gun pointed at the door.</p><p>  FDLE发布的人体摄像机录像显示，琼斯家门口有一名塔拉哈西警察，手握大锤，另一名执法人员则用枪指着门。</p><p> It also shows officers grabbing Jones, bringing her onto the front stoop and frisking her. In the lawsuit, she accused the anonymous officer of committing a battery on her &#34;by repeatedly running his hands up and down her ribs and by gripping and holding her sides.&#34;</p><p> 它也显示军官抓住琼斯，将她带到前弯并打她。在诉讼中，她指责这位匿名官员通过反复在肋骨上上下挥动双手并握紧并握住自己的侧面对自己进行殴打。</p><p> Jones, the architect of the state&#39;s COVID-19 dashboard that was praised by White House coronavirus task force physician Dr. Deborah Birx, was fired in May. Two months later she filed a whistleblower complaint with the Florida Commission on Human Relations, alleging the governor retaliated against her for refusing to manipulate data.</p><p> 琼斯是该州COVID-19仪表板的建筑师，受到白宫冠状病毒工作组医师Deborah Birx博士的称赞，他于5月被解雇。两个月后，她向佛罗里达州人际关系委员会提起举报人指控，指控州长因拒绝操纵数据而对她进行了报复。</p><p>  Her firing made Jones a social media celebrity. She set up her own COVID-19 dashboard and began reporting data from the state.</p><p>  她的解雇使琼斯成为社交媒体名人。她建立了自己的COVID-19仪表板，并开始报告该州的数据。</p><p> One difference is that, unlike the state, Jones includes people who received positive results from PCR, antigen and antibody testing in her daily report of those infected with the disease. The state&#39;s daily numbers include people who received positive results for PCR and antigen tests.</p><p> 一个区别是，与该州不同，琼斯在她的每日报告中发现了那些通过PCR，抗原和抗体检测获得阳性结果的人。该州的每日人数包括接受PCR和抗原检测阳性结果的人。</p><p>  Jones&#39;s dashboard shows about 95,000 more people who have contracted the virus since the pandemic began than the state&#39;s dashboard shows. Jones also includes non-residents in her death toll, which comes out to 293 more than the state&#39;s reported death toll of Florida residents only.</p><p>  琼斯的仪表板显示自大流行开始以来感染该病毒的人数比该州的仪表板显示的人数多了95,000。琼斯还将非居民的死亡人数包括在内，这一数字比该州报告的仅佛罗里达居民的死亡人数多293人。 </p><p> Newspapers, including the South Florida Sun-Sentinel and The Palm Beach Post, have reported a pattern of data manipulation and suppression by the governor and the Department of Health.</p><p>包括《南佛罗里达太阳哨兵报》和《棕榈滩邮报》在内的报纸都报道了州长和卫生部对数据的操纵和抑制模式。</p><p> While not named as a defendant, DeSantis is cast several times throughout the lawsuit as Jones&#39;s nemesis — accused of having a hand in her firing, and suggesting that he had some influence over the investigation against her. He has denied a role in either.</p><p> 迪桑蒂斯虽然没有被告身份，但在整个诉讼中多次被判为琼斯的克星-被指控在开除她的手时被暗示，并暗示他在针对她的调查中具有一定影响力。他否认有任何角色。</p><p> The suit points out that FDLE commissioners, while appointed by the entire Cabinet, can be singlehandledly fired by a governor, as was the case when Gov. Rick Scott removed Gerald Bailey as commissioner.</p><p> 该诉讼指出，FDLE专员虽然由整个内阁任命，但可以由州长一手开除，就像州长里克·斯科特（Rick Scott）罢免杰拉尔德·贝利（Gerald Bailey）担任专员一样。</p><p> &#34;DeSantis has been openly furious about Plaintiff&#39;s work because it exposes the ongoing falsification, suppression, and misleading that are salient features of the state&#39;s data reporting about COVID-19,&#34; the suit says. &#34;He has not missed any opportunity to heap vilification and obloquy on Plaintiff in the public media.&#34;</p><p> DeSantis对原告的工作公开表示愤怒，因为它暴露了正在进行的伪造，压制和误导，这是该州有关COVID-19的数据报告的主要特征，＆＃34;西装说。他没有错过任何机会在公开媒体上对原告进行诽谤和ob毁。</p><p>         Subscribe today using the link at the top of the page and never miss a story.</p><p>         立即使用页面顶部的链接进行订阅，永远不会错过一个故事。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2020/12/21/rebekah-jones-sues-fdle-over-morning-raid/3990170001/">https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2020/12/21/rebekah-jones-sues-fdle-over-morning-raid/3990170001/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/经理/">#经理</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/manager/">#manager</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
