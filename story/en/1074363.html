It’s useful for a few different reasons:</p><p>我每周都会重读一篇我最喜欢的关于生活建议的文章——每周一篇。它之所以有用，有几个不同的原因：</p><p> The best essays are dense enough with useful advice that I find new interesting bits every time I read them.</p><p>最好的文章有足够多的有用的建议，我每次读它们都会发现新的有趣的地方。</p><p> Much good advice is  easy to understand, but hard to implement. So to get the most benefit from it, you should find whatever version of it most resonates you and then  re-read it frequently to keep yourself on track.</p><p>许多好的建议很容易理解，但很难实施。因此，为了从中获得最大的好处，你应该找到最能引起你共鸣的版本，然后经常重读，让自己保持正轨。</p><p> I’ve collected my favorite essays for re-reading below. I’ll keep this updated as I find more great essays, and I’d welcome other contributions—please suggest your own favorites in the comments!</p><p>我收集了我最喜欢的文章，在下面重读。我会不断更新这篇文章，因为我发现了更多优秀的文章，我欢迎其他的贡献，请在评论中提出你自己的最爱！</p><p>    Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time, into discrete quantities. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year old. If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you only get to watch your child experience it 8 times. And while it’s impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity like time, 8 is not a lot of something. If you had a handful of 8 peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would definitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.</p><p>有了孩子，我学会了如何将连续的时间转化为离散的时间。你只有52个周末和你2岁的孩子在一起。如果圣诞魔法持续时间从3岁到10岁，你只能看你的孩子经历8次。虽然不可能说什么是大量或少量的连续量，比如时间，但8并不是很多。如果你有一把8个花生，或者一个书架上有8本书可供选择，那么无论你的寿命如何，数量肯定是有限的。</p><p>  It has for me. It means arguments of the form “Life is too short for x” have great force. It’s not just a figure of speech to say that life is too short for something. It’s not just a synonym for annoying. If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for something, you should try to eliminate it if you can.</p><p>这对我来说很重要。这意味着“生命对于x来说太短”这种形式的论点有很大的影响力。说生命太短暂，不适合做某事，这不仅仅是一种修辞。它不仅仅是烦人的同义词。如果你发现自己认为生命对于某件事来说太短，你应该尽可能地消除它。</p><p> When I ask myself what I’ve found life is too short for, the word that pops into my head is “bullshit.” I realize that answer is somewhat tautological. It’s almost the definition of bullshit that it’s the stuff that life is too short for. And yet bullshit does have a distinctive character. There’s something fake about it. It’s the junk food of experience. [1]</p><p>当我问自己，我发现生命对于什么来说太短了，脑海中闪现的词是“胡说”我意识到这个答案有些重复。这几乎是胡说八道的定义，它是生命短暂的东西。然而，废话确实有一个独特的特征。这有点假。这是经验的垃圾食品。[1]</p><p> If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that’s bullshit, you probably already know the answer. Unnecessary meetings, pointless disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people’s mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.</p><p>如果你问自己你花了多少时间在这上面，那是胡说，你可能已经知道答案了。不必要的会议、毫无意义的争端、官僚主义、装腔作势、处理他人的错误、交通堵塞、令人上瘾但毫无回报的消遣。</p><p> I’ve found that unless I’m vigilant, the amount of bullshit in my life only ever increases. Rereading  Life is Short every so often gives me a kick in the pants to figure out what  really matters and how to get the bullshit levels back down.</p><p>我发现，除非我保持警惕，否则我生活中的胡说八道只会越来越多。每隔一段时间重读《生命短暂》会让我大吃一惊，弄清楚什么才是真正重要的，以及如何让胡说八道的水平下降。</p><p>  Derek Sivers,  There is no speed limit, in which he learns a semester’s worth of music theory in an afternoon:</p><p>德里克·西弗斯，没有速度限制，他在一个下午学习了一学期的音乐理论：</p><p> Within a minute, he started quizzing me. “If the 5-chord with the flat-7 has that tri-tone, then so does another flat-7 chord. Which one?”</p><p>不到一分钟，他就开始盘问我。“如果五和弦和七号调有三个音，那么另一个七号调也有三个音。哪一个？”</p><p>  “Right! So that’s a substitute chord. Any flat-7 chord can be substituted with the other flat-7 that shares the same tri-tone. So reharmonize all the chords you can in this chart. Go.”</p><p>“对！这是一个替代和弦。任何一个7号平和弦都可以用另一个7号平和弦来替代，这个7号平和弦共享同一个三音。所以，在这个图表中，你可以重新协调所有和弦。开始。”</p><p> The pace was intense, and I loved it. Finally, someone was challenging me — keeping me in over my head — encouraging and expecting me to pull myself up quickly. I was learning so fast, it felt like the adrenaline rush you get while playing a video game. He tossed every fact at me and made me prove that I got it.</p><p>节奏很快，我很喜欢。最后，有人在挑战我——把我压在头上——鼓励并期待我尽快振作起来。我学得太快了，感觉就像玩电子游戏时的肾上腺素激增。他把所有事实都抛给我，让我证明我明白了。</p><p> In our three-hour lesson that morning, he taught me a full semester of Berklee’s harmony courses.</p><p>那天早上我们上了三个小时的课，他教了我整整一学期伯克利的和声课程。</p><p> This was one of the major inspirations for  Be impatient. Every time I reread it, I think of at least one thing where I’m setting myself a speed limit for no reason!</p><p>这是让你变得不耐烦的主要启示之一。每次我重读它，我都会想到至少一件事，我会无缘无故地给自己设置限速！</p><p>  Sam Altman,  How To Be Successful. Sam might have observed more successful people more closely than anyone else on the planet, and the advice is as good as you’d expect.</p><p>山姆·奥特曼，怎样才能成功。山姆可能比这个星球上的任何人都更仔细地观察到了更多成功人士，而这个建议正如你所期待的那样好。</p><p> Almost everyone I’ve ever met would be well-served by spending more time thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter.</p><p>花更多时间思考应该关注什么，几乎我见过的每个人都会受益匪浅。做正确的事情比长时间工作要重要得多。大多数人把大部分时间浪费在无关紧要的事情上。</p><p> Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small handful of priorities accomplished quickly. I have yet to meet a slow-moving person who is very successful.</p><p>一旦你想好了该做什么，就要毫不犹豫地迅速完成你的一小部分优先事项。我还没有遇到过一个行动迟缓、非常成功的人。</p><p>  Almost always, the people who say “I am going to keep going until this works, and no matter what the challenges are I’m going to figure them out”, and mean it, go on to succeed. They are persistent long enough to give themselves a chance for luck to go their way.</p><p>几乎总是，那些说“我会一直坚持下去，直到成功，不管有什么挑战，我都会找到答案”的人，他们是认真的，会继续取得成功。他们有足够长的毅力，给自己一个好运的机会。</p><p> &amp;mldr To be willful, you have to be optimistic—hopefully this is a personality trait that can be improved with practice. I have never met a very successful pessimistic person.</p><p>&amp；mldr要想任性，你必须乐观，希望这是一种可以通过实践改善的性格特征。我从未见过一个非常成功的悲观主义者。</p><p>   R. W. Hamming,  You and your research. Hamming observed almost as many great scientists as Sam Altman did founders. He had some interesting conclusions:</p><p>R·W·哈明，你和你的研究。哈明观察到的伟大科学家几乎和山姆·奥特曼观察到的一样多。他得出了一些有趣的结论：</p><p> At first I asked what were the important problems in chemistry, then what important problems they were working on, or problems that might lead to important results. One day I asked, “if what they were working on was not important, and was not likely to lead to important things, they why were they working on them?” After that I had to eat with the engineers!</p><p>起初，我问化学中的重要问题是什么，然后问他们正在研究哪些重要问题，或者可能导致重要结果的问题。一天，我问：“如果他们正在做的事情不重要，也不太可能导致重要的事情，他们为什么要做这些事情？”之后我不得不和工程师们一起吃饭！</p><p> About four months later, my friend stopped me in the hall and remarked that my question had bothered him. He had spent the summer thinking about the important problems in his area, and while had had not changed his research he thought it was well worth the effort. I thanked him and kept walking. A few weeks later I noticed that he was made head of the department. Many years later he became a member of the National Academy of Engineering. The one person who could hear the question went on to do important things and all the others—so far as I know—did not do anything worth public attention.</p><p>大约四个月后，我的朋友在大厅里拦住我，说我的问题困扰了他。他整个夏天都在思考他所在领域的重要问题，虽然没有改变他的研究，但他认为这是非常值得的。我谢了他，继续走。几周后，我注意到他被任命为部门负责人。许多年后，他成为美国国家工程院院士。一个能听到这个问题的人接着做了重要的事情，而据我所知，所有其他人都没有做任何值得公众关注的事情。</p><p> &amp;mldr Some people work with their doors open in clear view of those who pass by, while others carefully protect themselves from interruptions. Those with the door open get less work done each day, but those with their door closed tend not know what to work on, nor are they apt to hear the clues to the missing piece to one of their “list” problems. I cannot prove that the open door produces the open mind, or the other way around. I only can observe the correlation. I suspect that each reinforces the other, that an open door will more likely lead you and important problems than will a closed door.</p><p>&amp；mldr一些人在工作时开门，清楚地看到路过的人，而另一些人则小心地保护自己不受打扰。那些开门的人每天完成的工作更少，但那些关门的人往往不知道该做什么，也不容易听到他们“清单”问题中缺失部分的线索。我无法证明敞开的大门会产生开放的思想，或者反过来。我只能观察到这种相关性。我怀疑这两者都会加强彼此，一扇打开的门比一扇关闭的门更有可能导致你和重要的问题。</p><p>  There is another trait that took me many years to notice, and that is the ability to tolerate ambiguity. Most people want to believe what they learn is the truth: there are a few people who doubt everything. If you believe too much then you are not likely to find the essentially new view that transforms a field, and if you doubt too much you will not be able to do much at all. It is a fine balance between believing what you learn and at the same time doubting things. Great steps forward usually involve a change of viewpoint to outside the standard ones in the field.</p><p>我花了很多年才注意到另一个特点，那就是容忍歧义的能力。大多数人想相信他们所学到的是事实：有少数人对一切都持怀疑态度。如果你相信的太多，那么你就不太可能找到改变一个领域的全新视角，如果你怀疑的太多，你就根本做不到什么。这是一个很好的平衡，在相信你所学的同时又怀疑事物。伟大的进步通常需要改变观点，使之超越该领域的标准观点。</p><p> While you are leaning things you need to think about them and examine them from many sides. By connecting them in many ways with what you already know&amp;mldr. you can later retrieve them in unusual situations. It took me a long time to realize that each time I learned something I should put “hooks” on it. This is another face of the extra effort, the studying more deeply, the going the extra mile, that seems to be characteristic of great scientists.</p><p>当你学习东西的时候，你需要从多方面思考和审视它们。通过多种方式将它们与你已经知道的联系起来；mldr。您可以稍后在异常情况下检索它们。我花了很长时间才意识到，每次我学到一些东西，我都应该在上面挂上“钩子”。这是额外努力的另一面，更深入的研究，更深入的探索，这似乎是伟大科学家的特征。</p><p> Hamming is an unusual combination of (a) a great scientist himself, (b) curious and thoughtful about what makes others great, and (c) honest and open about his observations (it seems).</p><p>哈明是（a）一位伟大的科学家本人，（b）对什么使他人伟大感到好奇和深思熟虑，以及（c）对他的观察（似乎）诚实和开放的不寻常组合。</p><p>  Anonymous,  Becoming a Magician—on how to become a person that your current self would perceive as magical:</p><p>匿名，成为一名魔术师，讲述如何成为一个你现在的自己会觉得不可思议的人：</p><p> The description was about five or six handwritten pages long, and at the time, it was a manifestation of desperate longing to be somewhere other than where I was, someone who felt free and cared for. At the time I saw that description as basically an impossibility; my life could never be so amazing in reality.</p><p>这个描述大约有五六页长，当时，它是一种绝望的渴望的表现，渴望成为一个不在我身边的人，一个感到自由和被关心的人。当时我认为这种描述基本上是不可能的；我的生活在现实中从未如此精彩。</p><p> Fast forward about seven or ten years and I rediscovered the description when I was moving old notebooks and journals from one dusty storage spot to another. As I read through it, I discovered that 90% of the statements I had made in that description were true (or true in spirit). &amp;mldr It was incredible to me, despite all the changes that had happened in my life since when I wrote the passage, that I had basically become the person whose life I had dreamed of living as a teenager.</p><p>快进大约七十年，当我把旧笔记本和日记从一个尘土飞扬的存储点转移到另一个存储点时，我重新发现了这种描述。当我通读它时，我发现我在描述中所做的90%的陈述是真实的（或精神上是真实的）&amp；尽管自我写这篇文章以来，我的生活发生了种种变化，但对我来说，我基本上已经成为了一个我十几岁时梦想过的人，这让我难以置信。</p><p>  And then came Sanatan Dinda. An Indian visual artist from Kolkata, he didn’t even make the finals the first year he competed, and the next year he placed second with a style that broke half a dozen of the implicit rules of ‘good artwork’ at the competition. &amp;mldr [T]he third year he came he won the entire competition by something like ten percent of the total awarded points over the next artist in second place.</p><p>然后是萨纳坦·丁达。作为一名来自加尔各答的印度视觉艺术家，他参加比赛的第一年甚至没有进入决赛，第二年他以一种打破了比赛中“好作品”的六条隐含规则的风格排名第二&amp；mldr他来的第三年，他赢得了整个比赛，比第二名的下一位艺术家赢得了大约10%的总积分。</p><p> &amp;mldr The thing that confused me though was this – I could not work out how he did it. Like, I had zero mental model of how he created that piece in the same timeframe we all had; how he came up with it, designed it, practiced it. Even though he placed first and I placed fifth and logically we both existed on a scale of ‘competence at bodypainting’ it seemed like the skills required were completely different.</p><p>&amp；mldr让我困惑的是，我不知道他是怎么做到的。比如，我没有任何关于他是如何在我们所有人都有的时间框架内创作这首曲子的心智模型；他是如何想出、设计、实践的。尽管他排在第一位，我排在第五位，从逻辑上讲，我们都存在于“人体彩绘能力”的等级上，但所需的技能似乎完全不同。</p><p> The exercise they suggest is a really useful activity for weekly (or monthly or yearly) reviews. Highly recommended!</p><p>他们建议的练习对于每周（或每月或每年）的复习来说是非常有用的活动。强烈推荐！</p><p>  Dan Luu,  95th percentile isn’t that good. Great for cultivating self-improvement mindset by reminding you how easy (in some sense) it is to make huge improvements at something:</p><p>Dan Luu，第95百分位不是很好。通过提醒你（从某种意义上说）在某件事上取得巨大进步是多么容易，这对于培养自我提升的心态非常有用：</p><p> Reaching 95%-ile isn’t very impressive because it’s not that hard to do. I think this is one of my most ridiculable ideas. It doesn’t help that, when stated nakedly, that sounds elitist. But I think it’s just the opposite: most people can become (relatively) good at most things.</p><p>达到95%并不令人印象深刻，因为这并不难做到。我认为这是我最可笑的想法之一。如果赤裸裸地说出来，这听上去是精英主义的，那也无济于事。但我认为恰恰相反：大多数人可以（相对地）在大多数事情上变得很好。</p><p> Note that when I say 95%-ile, I mean 95%-ile among people who participate, not all people (for many activities, just doing it at all makes you 99%-ile or above across all people). I’m also not referring to 95%-ile among people who practice regularly. The “one weird trick” is that, for a lot of activities, being something like 10%-ile among people who practice can make you something like 90%-ile or 99%-ile among people who participate.</p><p>请注意，当我说95%-ile时，我的意思是95%-ile在参与的人中，而不是所有人中（对于许多活动来说，仅仅做它就可以使你在所有人中都达到99%-ile或更高）。我也不是指那些经常练习的人中95%的人。“一个奇怪的把戏”是，对于很多活动来说，在练习的人中，大约10%的人会让你在参与的人中，大约90%或99%的人。</p><p> It’s not weekly review material, but I also appreciate the bonus section on Dan’s other most ridiculable ideas.</p><p>这不是每周的评论材料，但我也很欣赏关于丹其他最可笑想法的奖励部分。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/2020/">#2020</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/生活/">#生活</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/essays/">#essays</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/时间/">#时间</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
