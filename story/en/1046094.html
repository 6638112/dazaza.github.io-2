Their mom had heard about a clinical trial being conducted at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, and Molly told me that she’d agreed to join because she wanted to contribute to the vaccine-development effort.</p><p>圣诞节过后的几天，14岁的莫莉·黑灵（Molly Hering）和12岁的弟弟山姆（Sam）在辉瑞针对孩子的COVID-19疫苗试验中得到了第一枪。他们的妈妈听说辛辛那提儿童医院正在进行一项临床试验，莫莉告诉我说她同意加入，因为她想为疫苗开发工作做出贡献。</p><p>   Molly and Sam’s dad was recently hospitalized with COVID-19. (He recovered.) Both kids have spent most of the past year dealing with Zoom school and its attendant technical glitches. Molly finally went back to in-person ninth grade this month, but masks and social distancing are required at school. Like everyone else, she’s looking forward to the end of the pandemic. “I’ll finally be able to go to school normally,” she said.</p><p>   莫莉和山姆的父亲最近因COVID-19住院。 （他康复了。）过去一年中，两个孩子都在与Zoom学校及其随之而来的技术故障打交道。莫莉（Molly）本月终于回到了小学九年级，但是学校需要戴口罩和社交。和其他所有人一样，她期待大流行的终结。她说：“我终于可以正常上学了。”</p><p> With COVID-19 vaccines proven to be safe and effective in most adults,  Pfizer and  Moderna have both begun U.S. trials for kids as young as 12. And if those trials go smoothly, the vaccines will be tested in younger and younger kids. This is typical for new vaccines: “It’s called the age deescalation strategy,” Carol Kao, a pediatrician at Washington University in St. Louis, told me.</p><p> 事实证明，对于大多数成年人来说，COVID-19疫苗是安全有效的，辉瑞和Moderna都已开始对12岁以下的孩子进行美国试验。如果试验顺利进行，该疫苗将在越来越小的孩子中进行测试。这对新疫苗来说很典型：“这就是所谓的降低年龄的策略，”圣路易斯华盛顿大学的儿科医生卡罗尔·考（Carol Kao）告诉我。</p><p>  There are some 70 million kids in the U.S., nearly a  quarter of the country’s population. Children in general are not especially vulnerable to COVID-19; most infections are mild or even asymptomatic. In some very rare cases— fewer than 0.01 percent—young patients can develop a complication called multisystem inflammatory syndrome, or MIS-C, but it is generally quite treatable in a hospital.</p><p>  美国有大约7000万孩子，占该国人口的近四分之一。一般而言，儿童并不是特别容易感染COVID-19；大多数感染是轻度甚至无症状的。在极少数情况下（不到0.01％），年轻患者会发展为多系统炎性综合征（MIS-C）的并发症，但通常在医院可以治愈。</p><p>  Vaccinating kids, however, is often not just about the direct and immediate benefits to them. It’s also meant to protect children against diseases that would otherwise become more dangerous for them as adults—measles, mumps, and chicken pox are three common examples—and dampen the overall spread of these diseases. In the short term, the primary reason to vaccinate children against COVID-19 may be that the U.S. will have a hard time reaching herd immunity otherwise.</p><p>  但是，给孩子接种疫苗通常不仅仅给他们带来直接和直接的好处。这还意味着保护儿童免受疾病的侵害，否则这些疾病对成年人来说将变得更加危险（麻疹，腮腺炎和水痘是三个常见的例子），并抑制这些疾病的整体传播。从短期来看，为儿童接种抗COVID-19疫苗的主要原因可能是美国否则很难获得群体免疫力。</p><p>   Vaccines that work in adults generally work in children. But their effects can differ, especially in very young children. In newborns, for example, antibodies passed to them in utero can interfere with the protection conferred by the  measles vaccine, which is why that vaccine is not given until babies are  12 to 15 months old. An  early version of the pneumococcal vaccine did not work well in children under 2, because it stimulated a part of the immune system that was not yet mature.</p><p>   在成年人中工作的疫苗通常在儿童中工作。但是它们的作用可能会有所不同，尤其是在很小的孩子中。例如，在新生儿中，在子宫内传递给他们的抗体会干扰麻疹疫苗的保护作用，这就是为什么直到12至15个月大的婴儿才接种该疫苗。早期版本的肺炎球菌疫苗在2岁以下的儿童中效果不佳，因为它刺激了尚未成熟的免疫系统的一部分。</p><p>  Multiple factors determine the recommended age for a vaccination. “For example, when’s the peak incidence of disease? When is a child most likely to respond to the vaccine?” says Cody Meissner, an expert on pediatric infectious diseases at Tufts. The answers to those questions might not align. For instance, the vaccine for HPV, a sexually transmitted virus that can lead to cervical cancer, is given to boys and girls as  young as 9 years old because it stimulates a  better immune response in preteens than in older adolescents, even though preteens are unlikely to need the protection until later in life.</p><p>  多种因素决定疫苗接种的建议年龄。 “例如，什么时候发病高峰？什么时候最有可能对疫苗产生反应？”塔夫茨大学小儿传染病专家科迪·迈斯纳说。这些问题的答案可能不一致。例如，针对9岁以下的男孩和女孩使用HPV疫苗（一种可导致子宫颈癌的性传播病毒），因为与未成年的青少年相比，这种疫苗在青春期比青少年中能激发更好的免疫反应。在以后的生活中需要保护。 </p><p> Even though kids rarely get seriously sick from COVID-19, the vaccine can protect them from an illness that may still be bad enough for them to miss school and their parents to miss work, Jeff Gerber, a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told me. “Even those two-to-three-day illnesses can pile up.” He pointed out that the flu vaccine is recommended for kids, and about the same number of children  died of the flu last season as have  died of COVID-19 to date.</p><p>费城儿童医院儿科医生杰夫·格伯（Jeff Gerber）告诉记者，即使孩子很少会因COVID-19得重病，这种疫苗仍可以保护他们免受疾病困扰，甚至可能使他们无法上学，父母无法上班。我。 “即使是两到三天的疾病也会堆积起来。”他指出，建议为孩子们使用流感疫苗，上个季节死于流感的孩子人数与迄今为止死于COVID-19的孩子数量相同。</p><p>  But the main argument for broadly vaccinating children is that doing so is likely to reduce COVID-19 transmission. Although schools have not been sources of large outbreaks, many switched to distance learning, and most of those that held in-person classes required masks and distancing. If school buildings reopen without these precautions sometime this year, after adults get vaccinated but while kids are still vulnerable, they will essentially be hosting mass gatherings of unvaccinated people, says Jason Newland, a pediatrician at Washington University. “Guess who’s going to end up having it? All the kids,” he told me. “And those kids with certain underlying conditions are disproportionately impacted.” What’s more, kids could bring COVID-19 home from school, even if they don’t have symptoms. “Children could pass it on to Grandma and Grandpa. They can pass it on to another loved one who has diabetes or has obesity or has chronic kidney disease” and is not yet vaccinated, Newland said.</p><p>  但是，为儿童广泛接种疫苗的主要论据是，这样做可能会减少COVID-19的传播。尽管学校并不是大规模爆发的源头，但许多学校都转向远程学习，而且大多数亲自授课的学校都要求戴口罩和隔离。华盛顿大学的儿科医生杰森·纽兰德说，如果在今年的某个时候在成年人未接种疫苗但孩子仍很脆弱的情况下重新开放学校建筑时，则基本上将举办未接种疫苗的群众聚会。 “猜猜谁最终会拥有它？所有的孩子，”他告诉我。 “那些具有某些潜在疾病的孩子受到的影响尤其严重。”而且，即使没有症状，孩子也可以将COVID-19放学回家。 “孩子们可以把它传给奶奶和爷爷。纽兰德说，他们可以将其传播给另一个患有糖尿病，肥胖或患有慢性肾脏疾病但尚未接种疫苗的亲人。</p><p>  Public-health experts think that if precautions are in place, community transmission is low, and teachers and high-risk people are vaccinated,  reopening schools in 2021 will be worth any remaining risk, given the many and wide-ranging  consequences of keeping them closed. But the more children are vaccinated, the safer and more normal school reopenings will be.</p><p>  公共卫生专家认为，如果采取适当的预防措施，社区传播率低下以及为教师和高危人群接种疫苗，那么考虑到保持封闭的诸多后果，到2021年重新开放学校将仍然值得承担。 。但是，接种疫苗的儿童越多，学校的重新开放就越安全和正常。</p><p>  The ultimate goal of most vaccination campaigns is not just to protect the individuals who get the vaccines, but to prevent the spread of the disease to those who can’t get it, such as infants and  people at risk of allergic reactions. The more transmissible the virus—and unfortunately COVID-19 appears to be  evolving to be more transmissible—the more people need to be vaccinated in order to reach herd immunity and stop its spread through a population. The herd-immunity threshold against COVID-19 is estimated to be somewhere between  60 and 90 percent of the population. Because some people can’t get the vaccine and some may be steadfastly opposed to it, the U.S. needs to vaccinate as many of the rest of us as it can. “What we want to do is reduce the number of people who might be contagious to others,” Meissner told me. Children will almost certainly need to be a part of that effort.</p><p>  大多数疫苗接种运动的最终目标不仅是保护接种疫苗的人，而且是为了防止疾病传播给无法获得疫苗的人，例如婴儿和有过敏反应风险的人。该病毒传播性越强（不幸的是，COVID-19似乎在发展为更易传播性），需要接种更多的人才能获得牛群免疫力并阻止其在人群中传播。据估计，针对COVID-19的牛群免疫阈值为人群的60％至90％。由于有些人无法获得疫苗，有些人可能会坚决反对，因此美国需要给我们其余的人尽可能多的疫苗。迈斯纳对我说：“我们要做的是减少可能传染给他人的人数。”儿童几乎肯定会需要参与其中。</p><p> A still unanswered question about the COVID-19 vaccines, however, is how well they protect against asymptomatic transmission of the virus. When vaccinated people are exposed to the virus, their bodies’ immune response tamps down its replication—enough to reduce symptoms by 95 percent, according to the results of the Pfizer and Moderna trials for adults. But a person who is vaccinated and then exposed might still carry enough virus to spread it to others. Experts think the vaccines very likely reduce the risk of asymptomatic transmission, but follow-up studies are needed to find out by how much.</p><p> 然而，关于COVID-19疫苗的一个尚无答案的问题是它们如何有效地抵抗病毒的无症状传播。辉瑞和Moderna的成年人试验结果显示，当接种疫苗的人接触该病毒时，他们的身体的免疫反应会抑制其复制，足以将症状减轻95％。但是，接种疫苗然后暴露的人可能仍携带足够的病毒，可以将其传播给他人。专家认为，疫苗很可能会降低无症状传播的风险，但是需要进行后续研究以找出疫苗的量。</p><p>   How soon the vaccines are available to children will depend on how long the clinical trials and the FDA review process take. In the most optimistic scenario, a vaccine could be available for large numbers of kids, especially older ones, in time for the start of the school year in the fall. But last week, Operation Warp Speed said that Moderna was  having trouble recruiting enough participants in its trial for adolescents, having enrolled only 800 out of a planned 3,000. The  company’s CEO also said that while Moderna would soon begin trials for kids ages 1 to 11, it did not expect to have results until 2022. Pfizer’s adolescent trial has  reportedly finished enrollment, though the company declined to specify when it plans to move on to younger children.</p><p>   为儿童提供疫苗的时间将取决于临床试验和FDA审查过程需要多长时间。在最乐观的情况下，可以在秋季的学年开始之前为大量的孩子提供疫苗，尤其是较大的孩子。但是在上周，“扭曲速度行动”表示，Moderna难以招募足够的青少年参加试验，计划的3,000人中只有800人参加了试验。该公司的首席执行官还表示，尽管Moderna即将针对1至11岁的孩子开始试验，但它预计不会在2022年之前获得结果。据报道，辉瑞的青春期试验已经完成报名，尽管该公司拒绝透露何时计划继续进行试验。年幼的孩子。</p><p> The FDA fast-tracked the COVID-19 vaccines for adults using a process called emergency use authorization. But the normal vaccine-approval process may be more appropriate for children, says Vanderbilt’s Tina Hartert, who is leading a study on the incidence of COVID-19 in kids. Approval will take more time for several reasons. For example, the FDA has said that it wants to see more  safety data—six months or more depending on the novelty of the vaccine technology—compared with the  two months required for emergency use.</p><p> FDA使用称为紧急使用授权的程序对成年人的COVID-19疫苗进行了快速跟踪。范德比尔特（Vanderbilt）的蒂娜·哈特（Tina Hartert）领导了一项有关儿童中COVID-19发病率研究的研究，但通常的疫苗批准程序可能更适合儿童。出于多种原因，批准将需要更多时间。例如，FDA表示希望获得更多的安全性数据（六个月或更长时间，具体取决于疫苗技术的新颖性），而紧急使用则需要两个月。 </p><p>  The newness of the COVID-19 vaccines combined with the mildness of the disease in children might lead to hesitancy in some parents. When the chicken pox vaccine first became available, in the 1990s, uptake was slow—until public schools started requiring it. Meissner, who sits on the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, said he thinks schools are unlikely to require a vaccine that is authorized only for emergency use. But there is genuine debate among advisory groups about whether to mandate COVID-19 vaccination at all. “Once you require a vaccine,” Meissner says, “a lot of people who ordinarily might get the vaccine become indignant and say, ‘I’m not going to be told what I have to do for myself or my family.’”</p><p>COVID-19疫苗的新颖性与儿童疾病的轻度相结合可能会导致某些父母的犹豫。在1990年代首次获得水痘疫苗时，吸收速度很慢-直到公立学校开始要求使用水痘疫苗为止。 FDA疫苗咨询委员会成员的Meissner说，他认为学校不太可能需要仅授权用于紧急用途的疫苗。但是，咨询小组之间是否存在关于是否要强制接种COVID-19疫苗的真正辩论。迈斯纳说：“一旦需要疫苗，很多通常会接种疫苗的人就会愤慨地说，‘我不会被告知要为自己或家人做什么。”</p><p> In the long term, the COVID-19 virus is  unlikely to go away entirely—and neither is the need for vaccination. If the  virus continues to mutate or if immunity wanes, annual vaccinations or boosters every few years might be necessary. The vaccines could also become part of the recommended childhood immunization schedule. Experts say this is the best way to ensure that the entire population remains protected. “The most successful implementation programs are universal pediatric programs,” Kathleen Neuzil, a vaccine researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, told me. Parents are already used to their children getting shots from pediatricians, and pediatricians are already used to vaccinating large numbers of children. Although children may not be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, they will be when they reach adulthood. And vaccinating large numbers of adults, as the world is currently finding, is very difficult indeed.</p><p> 从长远来看，COVID-19病毒不太可能完全消失，也不需要接种疫苗。如果病毒继续突变或免疫力下降，则可能需要每隔几年进行一次年度疫苗接种或加强免疫。这些疫苗也可能成为建议的儿童免疫计划的一部分。专家说，这是确保整个人口受到保护的最佳方法。马里兰大学医学院的疫苗研究员凯瑟琳·诺伊齐尔（Kathleen Neuzil）告诉我：“最成功的实施方案是全民儿科方案。”父母已经习惯了他们的孩子从儿科医生那里打针，儿科医生已经习惯了给大量孩子接种疫苗。尽管儿童可能并非特别容易受到COVID-19的影响，但他们将在成年后出现。而且，正如世界目前所发现的那样，为大量成年人接种疫苗确实非常困难。</p><p> Molly Hering, who is participating in the Pfizer trial, doesn’t yet know whether she got the placebo or the actual vaccine. She and her brother are using an app to track their side effects; she had some nausea and headaches after she first got the shot, while he had a low fever. They are going back for their second shots this week. For childhood vaccinations to help slow the spread of the virus, more volunteers will have to join them in the trials.</p><p> 参与辉瑞试验的莫莉·黑灵（Molly Hering）尚不知道自己是否服用了安慰剂或实际疫苗。她和她的兄弟正在使用一个应用程序来跟踪他们的副作用。刚出手后她就有些恶心和头痛，而他发烧了。他们本周将进行第二次射击。为了在儿童时期接种疫苗以减缓病毒的传播，更多的志愿者将不得不参加试验。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/01/should-kids-get-covid-19-vaccine/617762/">https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/01/should-kids-get-covid-19-vaccine/617762/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/可能/">#可能</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/key/">#key</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/疫苗/">#疫苗</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
