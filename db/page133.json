Instead of waiting for a return to normalcy, she shifted the scope of the app entirely.\n Today,  Squad relaunches as an audio-based social app that aims to help users deepen their relationship with their existing circle of close friends. Squad is an audio-only app, but don\u2019t worry \u2014 it\u2019s not another Clubhouse wannabe. Instead, it functions as a news feed of voice message updates from your closest friends, which expire after 24 hours.\n  You can add up to twelve friends to your \u201csquad,\u201d and once you post an update, your squad members can emoji react or send a private voice message in response \u2014 these also expire after a day, encouraging users to be more open about what they share. Soon, Squad will support phone calls, but there currently isn\u2019t functionality for group calls or group audio messaging. But, users might be incentivized to talk on the phone via Squad rather than a typical call, since you can add a title to your call. That way, your squad member knows why you\u2019re calling before they pick up.\n  \u201cThere\u2019s a big gap in the social landscape, because most of the tools are discovery platforms, broadcast platforms, and personal branding platforms,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge opportunity for us to come in and help people maintain stronger connections with the people that they enjoy the most.\u201d\n Posting a voice update feels more genuine than a curated Instagram shot or a crafted Facebook status update (and  Facebook is decidedly uncool among Gen Z and millennials). As the popularity of apps like  Dispo show, young people are responding well to ephemeral, authentic social media experiences. But the audio-only medium could be a hard sell for people who aren\u2019t already sending voice messages on WhatsApp or iMessage. However, while Squad\u2019s initial rollout will be domestic, there\u2019s great potential for an app like this outside of the US, where  voice messaging is more popular.\n \u201cA lot of the conversations that would happen on text message are now happening in an asynchronous audio type of way,\u201d Watson added. \u201cSo we expect that to continue to penetrate further into our habits.\u201d\n Watson raised a $3.5 million seed round in 2019, and she was  featured on TechCrunch with advice on raising venture capital as a woman of color in Silicon Valley. Despite changing the direction of her app, her investors \u2014 which include Michael Dearing (Harrison Metal), Aaron Levie (Box), Katrina Lake (StichFix), Jen Rubio (Away), and Stewart Butterfield (Slack) \u2014 remain supportive. Watson secured another million dollars of funding after the seed round, bringing Squad\u2019s funding to a total of $4.5 million to date.\n \u201cOne thing [the investors] said to me was, \u2018Isa, you\u2019ve been talking about this shift in social for years now, and people told you you were crazy, that social was all figured out and there was nothing that was going to happen,\u2019\u201d Watson said. \u201cNow, people are buying into that change.\u201d\n  Even though Squad isn\u2019t a Clubhouse competitor, the rise of audio-only media is a good sign for the app\u2019s ability to crack a saturated social market (so many social apps are trying to compete with Clubhouse, it\u2019s a miracle we don\u2019t yet have audio-only Tinder speed dating). In Squad\u2019s beta test, 87.5% of users completed the onboarding process. Still, Squad falls victim to the same accessibility issues that plague Clubhouse and many of its clones. As of yet, Squad doesn\u2019t support captioning, though Watson says this is something the company has discussed and hopes to implement down the road. Not only could captioning broaden Squad\u2019s audience, but it could also further differentiate the app from messaging giants like iMessage and WhatsApp.\n Still, if you\u2019re someone who loves to send voice messages in your group chats, you might want to get your friends on Squad. Currently, the app is invite-only with a waitlist. Once you\u2019re off the waitlist, you get three invites. If you post for five days straight, you get three more invites, and if someone you invited signs up, you get two more invites as well. This continues until you round out your twelve-member squad.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 21:59:38", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

Alloy, and Little Spoon.\n Bilt has two main pieces, a rewards platform and a credit card, powered by Mastercard.\n  On the rewards side, Bilt has partnered with estate owners and property managers including the Blackstone Group, The Related Companies and Equity Residential. Folks who rent with these entities can now earn rewards each time they pay their rent, with the opportunity to earn even more rewards for things like lease renewals or lease signing bonuses.\n The co-branded  Bilt Mastercard credit card allows renters at those properties, or any other renter, to pay their rent with the credit card. As a renter myself, and as one that is still forced to pay by check via snail mail, this is a welcome offering.\n Folks who use the Bilt Mastercard will earn 2x points on rent payments and one point per dollar spent on the card elsewhere.\n These points, whether earned through spending on the card or by paying rent at Bilt-partnered properties, can be used toward travel with airlines and hotels, as well as other perks like group fitness classes. But perhaps the most significant option for spending points is to use them toward a mortgage payment.\n Bilt worked with regulators, as well as Fannie Mae and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to gain approval for using rewards points toward a mortgage. So not only can people use their rewards points toward their down payment on a home, but folks using the Bilt Mastercard can also build their credit score and earn rewards at the same time, bringing down the rates on their mortgage.\n On the revenue side, Bilt takes a cut of the transaction fee alongside Mastercard for purchases made through the Bilt credit card. The startup also generates revenue by charging property managers for the points they distribute to their tenants.\n \u201cThree years ago, if you asked us if we could bring together an alliance of property owners to work together under one unified rewards program, it would have been hard to imagine,\u201d said Jain. \u201cIf you think about getting payment networks to collaborate on a credit card or fees on rent, most people would have said that\u2019s not possible.

They\u2019ll be offered as part the studio\u2019s Epic Online Services suite, which is available to use with any game engine and supports Windows, Mac, Linux, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android.\n The new voice chat service is cross platform and supports both one-on-one and party chat in lobbies and during in-game matches. When using the service, voice data is relayed through Epic\u2019s back-end servers, and the technology handles all scaling and quality of service features. Epic says the technology has already been \u201cintegrated and battle-tested in  Fortnite,\u201d which provides some assurance that it can handle millions of players at once.\n  Alongside voice chat, Epic Online Services is also adding support for Easy Anti-Cheat, a service designed to root out and boot cheaters from online games. Easy Anti-Cheat has previously been available  for third-party developers to license for their games, but it\u2019s now free as part of Epic Online Services and should allow many more developers to make use of it. Epic argues anti-cheat software like this is increasingly important as more games offer cross-play between PCs and other platforms, since cheating software is often more readily available on PC.\n Like other anti-cheat software, Easy Anti-Cheat can occasionally  cause issues for non-cheaters and  label innocent software as malicious, so it\u2019s far from a perfect solution. But with cheating still  plaguing many of the world\u2019s biggest games, it\u2019s hard to argue against developers having another tool in their arsenal.\n Epic is including both services as part of its Epic Online Services suite, which isn\u2019t tied to its own game engine or storefront.

After giving serial daters the  ability to video chat last fall, the app is now letting members add multiple clips to their profile. Starting today, users will be able to edit and upload up to nine recorded videos from their phone to their Tinder profile. This, the company says, offers members a more &#34;authentic way to express themselves.&#34; In particular, Tinder expects its Gen Z users raised on TikTok and YouTube to take to the feature with aplomb. The demographic makes up 50 percent of its global user base.\n Video is just one of several new additions included in Tinder&#39;s latest update, which it hails as one of the biggest changes to its app since launch. It&#39;s also introducing a new speed dating-style social feature called &#34;Hot Takes&#34; that lets unmatched users talk in short spurts before swiping right or left. When the timer runs out, you&#39;ll be able to choose whether to match with the person or move on to another session. Hot Takes will be available from 6pm to midnight on weekdays and marks the first time Tinder users have been able to chat before they match. It actually sounds similar to  Spark, the dedicated speed dating app Facebook launched in April.\n   Finally, Tinder is also debuting a new section called Explore as a way for singletons to connect based on their shared interests, and as a showcase for its live events like Hot Takes. You&#39;ll be able to find potential matches based on their &#34;Passions&#34; like activism, binge watching or thrill seeking. The Explore section will launch later this summer.

", "note_en": "Personal data will continue to flow unimpeded from the EU to the UK, the bloc&#39;s member states have agreed in a unanimous decision that will relieve many businesses on both sides of the Channel of spending much time and money on complex legal paperwork.\n All 27 member states\u00a0 voted in favor of granting the UK an adequacy decision\u00a0\u2013 a special status that recognizes that the country&#39;s data laws do as good a job as the European GDPR at protecting personal information.\n     Countries that are granted adequacy gain the right to receive and process the personal data of EU citizens, which many organizations rely on to do business.\n  The UK&#39;s departure from the EU has meant that the country has ceased to be protected by the GDPR, and instead relies on domestic laws to manage citizens&#39; personal data. Those laws had to be assessed by EU regulators to ensure that they meet the bloc&#39;s standards on data protection.\n Without an adequacy decision, organizations would have had to design special contracts called Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), to ensure that they were lawfully processing the data of European citizens. Economists estimate that the total cost of implementing those new contracts to keep data flowing legally could amount to \u00a31.6 billion ($2.14 billion), with smaller firms hit the hardest.\n Achieving adequacy, therefore, was a key part of Brexit negotiations. Earlier this year, the European Commission\u00a0 published a draft document outlining the details of an adequacy decision for the UK, which determined that UK laws do indeed provide a level of data protection that is equivalent to the GDPR.\n   The decision was approved by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) in April and has now been green-lighted by member states, meaning that adequacy is on course to be implemented. Unsurprisingly, organisations and businesses across the EU and the UK have welcomed the announcement.\n &#34;A positive decision on data adequacy is a huge relief for thousands of businesses across the UK \u2013 over half of businesses surveyed by the DMA just before Brexit stated this was important for the future of their business,&#34; says Chris Combemale, the CEO of the Data and Marketing Association (DMA). &#34;The government estimated that without adequacy the UK economy could lose up to \u00a385 billion, so this announcement is a significant boost after a challenging year.&#34;\n The volume of personal data that is exchanged between the UK and the EU is significant and spans virtually all industries \u2013 think legal and financial services, but also e-commerce, human resources, and even healthcare.\n The Federation of European Academies of Medicine (FEAM), for example, stressed that the delivery of cross-border health and social care for thousands of European citizens relies on data flowing without restrictions with the UK. Health data transfers are also key to advance scientific research.\n &#34;With this (adequacy) decision, the EU and the UK can continue to benefit from the continued secure flow of personal data to facilitate the development of new treatments and to improve patient safety and care across Europe,&#34;\u00a0 said FEAM in a statement.\n While adequacy has been granted to the UK for the time being, however, the decision only applies to UK data law as it is written now. Also known as the &#34;UK GDPR&#34;, the country&#39;s domestic rules are currently modelled on European law and as such, provide a high level of data protection for citizens. But if that were to change, the EU has made clear that it could re-evaluate the decision and withdraw the agreement.\n The issue might become a point of contention. Over the past few months, the UK has repeatedly sent signals that it aims to\u00a0 seize the Brexit opportunity to diverge from the standards set by the bloc&#39;s GDPR\u00a0in an effort to boost growth and innovation.\n &#34;Adequacy was received on the basis that the UK would not diverge and not change the level of protection,&#34; Estelle Mass\u00e9, senior policy analyst and data protection lead at digital rights organisation Access Now, tells ZDNet. &#34;If the UK government were to follow through with this, then the whole legal system on which the EU has based its adequacy determination will no longer be in place and will need to be re-evaluated.&#34;\n     Just days before the EU member states voted in favor of adequacy,\u00a0 a government taskforce submitted a report to the UK prime minister with recommendations to reform the country&#39;s regulatory landscape\u00a0\u2013 including some changes to the UK GDPR.\n Describing the GDPR as &#34;out of date&#34;, the taskforce called for the government to leverage its &#34;newfound regulatory freedom&#34; to replace GDPR with a new UK-made framework for data protection.\n According to the report, GDPR compliance can cost businesses up to 30 working days-worth of time a year, and as such constitutes a significant barrier to innovation and growth. To create a more business-friendly environment, said the taskforce, the UK should implement data laws that are more proportionate, and place lower compliance burdens on smaller organisations.\n In particular, the report&#39;s authors called for the removal of a GDPR provision that lets citizens refuse to be subjected to a decision based solely on an automated decision-making system \u2013 which means that organisations must always have an alternative, human-based process in place to use as an alternative.\n  Instead, the taskforce suggested that automated decisions should be subjected to a test determining whether they are in the public&#39;s interest, and whether they meet critical fairness and transparency criteria.\n The authors also pointed to the GDPR&#39;s restrictions on using data for any purposes other than those for which it was collected, and argued that this means that organisations cannot experiment with data to understand its potential value in new applications.\n The report&#39;s recommendations are yet another red flag for some in the EU. &#34;If this is removed, it could potentially mean that the UK wants to be able to develop the use of automated decision-making systems in the public and private sectors in a way that people couldn&#39;t say no,&#34; says Mass\u00e9.\n &#34;The UK is completely free to take that path is they find it is more beneficial for them. But there will be consequences: if the UK chooses to diverge a lot from the EU, then it will lose its adequacy, and all the industries that rely on exchanging data between the EU and the UK will be in trouble.&#34;\n The next few months are likely to reveal how far the UK wishes to go in transforming the country&#39;s domestic rules on data protection \u2013 and crucially, how much leeway the EU will be willing to give. On both sides, says Mass\u00e9, the outcome of the strategy is still unclear.\n &#34;It&#39;s really quite incomprehensible to work so much to secure this adequacy and when just about to get it, to also give indication to the EU that it may change,&#34; she says. &#34;It&#39;s a really hard diplomacy game \u2013 almost as if the UK is testing the limits of the EU.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-22 21:50:46", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u82f1\u56fd,uk", "title": "\u6b27\u76df\u6210\u5458\u56fd\u6279\u51c6\u4e86\u6b27\u76df\u548c\u82f1\u56fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u65e0\u963b\u788d\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u52a8\uff0c\u51b3\u5b9a\u82f1\u56fd\u7684\u6cd5\u89c4\u4e0eGDPR\u4e00\u6837\u597d\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f01\u4e1a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u4e66\u5de5\u4f5c ", "title_en": "EU member states approve unimpeded data flows between EU and UK, deciding UK's regulations are as good as GDPR, avoiding complex legal paperwork for businesses", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-major-international-data-flow-problem-just-got-resolved-but-another-row-is-already-brewing/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u82f1\u56fd", "uk"]}]
