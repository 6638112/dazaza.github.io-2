By the end of the first quarter of 2020-2021, nearly 10,000 Fairfax students had scored F’s in two or more classes — an increase of more than 4,300 students as compared with the group who received F’s by the same time last year.</p><p>  弗吉尼亚州的费尔法克斯县公立学校（自3月以来大部分时间都在线）在本周发布了一份内部分析报告，显示在上一学年至本学年之间，至少有两堂课获得F分数的初中和高中学生所占的百分比跃升了增长83％：从6％增长到11％。到2020-2021年第一季度末，将近10,000名Fairfax学生在两个或两个以上的班级中为F评分-与去年同期获得F的组相比，增加了4,300多名学生。</p><p> Experts have warned since the beginning of the pandemic, and the unexpected national experiment in online learning, that remote schooling would take a serious academic toll on children.</p><p> 自大流行开始以来，专家们就警告说，在线学习方面出乎意料的全国性实验警告说，远程教育会对儿童造成严重的学术损失。</p><p>   Now, evidence of poor achievement in virtual classrooms is beginning to emerge nationwide: In the Independent School District in Houston,  more than 40 percent of students are earning failing grades in at least two of their classes, according to data reported by the Houston Chronicle. Likewise in St. Paul, Minn., where the superintendent recently reported that  nearly 40 percent of St. Paul Public Schools high-schoolers have failing marks, local TV station KARE reported.</p><p>   现在，在虚拟教室中成绩不佳的证据正在全国范围内出现：根据《休斯顿纪事报》报道的数据，在休斯顿的独立学区，至少有两个班的学生有40％的成绩不及格。同样在明尼苏达州圣保罗市，据当地电视台KARE报道，该校长最近报道说，圣保罗公立学校的高中生中有近40％的学生成绩不及格。</p><p> Educators have struggled with the question of how to grade students in a virtual environment since the spring. Many districts opted for a pass/fail system to close out the final quarter of the 2019-2020 school year because students and teachers had been thrust into an online-only world with almost no time to adjust or prepare.</p><p> 自春季以来，教育工作者一直在努力思考如何在虚拟环境中给学生评分的问题。许多地区选择通过/不通过系统来关闭2019-2020学年的最后一个季度，因为学生和教师被迫进入一个仅在线的世界，几乎没有时间进行调整或准备。</p><p> But the tactic led to significant dips in engagement and attendance, as families forced to navigate the vagaries of the pandemic prioritized other concerns. So, after school districts built remote learning curriculums from scratch over the summer, many advised teachers they should grade as close as possible to what they normally would come fall. School officials hoped to send a message: Students must take virtual school seriously.</p><p> 但是，这种策略导致订婚和出勤率大幅下降，因为被迫应对大流行病的家庭被迫优先考虑其他问题。因此，在学区在夏季从零开始构建远程学习课程之后，许多建议老师应该对他们的成绩尽可能接近秋季的成绩。学校官员希望传达信息：学生必须认真对待虚拟学校。</p><p>   The apparent consequences of that decision, demonstrated afresh by the Fairfax statistics published this week, are confirming fears about how the pandemic is driving an equity gap in American education that may prove impossible to close. Fairfax’s data shows that children who are engaged and care deeply about school — children in stable home situations, whose parents have sufficient resources — will stay engaged in an online environment, while children whose temperament, socioeconomic status or home situation have historically barred them from academic achievement will slip further and further behind.</p><p>   这项决定的明显后果已在本周公布的费尔法克斯统计数据中再次得到证实，这证实了人们对这种流行病如何导致美国教育公平性差距的担忧，而这种差距可能无法消除。费尔法克斯（Fairfax）的数据显示，对学校充满敬业和关怀的孩子（家庭条件稳定的孩子，父母有足够的资源）将继续在线环境中从事工作，而气质，社会经济地位或家庭状况一直使他们无法学习的孩子成就将越来越落后。</p><p> Children who were middling or poor students suddenly began earning more failing marks, including in classes they had not failed before, according to the Fairfax analysis. Historically low-performing students are seeing an explosion of C’s, D’s and F’s this semester, far more than would have been expected based on their pattern of achievement in past years.</p><p>根据Fairfax的分析，中等或贫困学生的孩子突然开始获得更多的不及格分数，包括以前从未未及格的班级。历史上表现不佳的学生看到本学期C，D和F的爆炸式增长，远远超过了根据过去几年的成就模式所预期的水平。</p><p> “Results indicate a widening gap between students who were previously performing satisfactorily and those performing unsatisfactorily,” the report concludes. “Students who performed well previously primarily performed slightly better than expected during Q1 of this year.”</p><p> 报告总结说：“结果表明，以前表现令人满意的学生与表现不理想的学生之间的差距正在扩大。” “以前表现良好的学生在今年第一季度的表现主要略好于预期。”</p><p>   “In contrast, students who were previously not performing well, performed considerably less well,” it continues.</p><p>   “相比之下，以前表现不佳的学生表现差很多，”它继续说道。</p><p> Even in normal times, factors such as socioeconomic status, race and whether parents speak English accounted for roughly two-thirds of student achievement scores and standardized test prowess, said Jack Schneider, an assistant professor of education at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell who directs research for the Massachusetts Consortium for Innovative Education and recently  published a book on public-school testing.</p><p> 洛厄尔马萨诸塞大学教育学助理教授杰克·施耐德说，即使在平时，诸如社会经济地位，种族和父母是否会说英语等因素也占学生成绩得分和标准化考试能力的三分之二。马萨诸塞州创新教育联盟的研究，最近出版了一本关于公立学校考试的书。</p><p> At this phase of the pandemic, he said, the United States has reached a tipping point: The damage done to schoolchildren with scarce resources is likely to be irreparable. The best thing the nation can do would be to offer everyone a “do-over,” Schneider said.</p><p> 他说，在大流行的这一阶段，美国已经达到了一个临界点：对资源匮乏的学童的伤害可能是无法弥补的。施耐德说，这个国家最好的办法就是为每个人提供“重做”。</p><p>   “The default should be, once we’re in-person again, everybody could go back to the grade they were in March of 2020,” he said. “We need to slow the pace down in the name of equity.”</p><p>   他说：“默认值是，一旦我们再次面对面，每个人都可以回到2020年3月的水平。” “我们需要以股票的名义放慢脚步。”</p><p> In Fairfax, whose 186,000 students make it the largest school system in Virginia, Superintendent Scott Brabrand said officials are working swiftly to boost grades. He noted many children who were performing well academically before the pandemic are still earning high marks, although he acknowledged that others “who previously struggled in school . . . continue to do so.”</p><p> 在费尔法克斯，有186,000名学生成为弗吉尼亚州最大的学校系统，学区长斯科特·布拉布兰德（Scott Brabrand）说，官员们正在迅速努力提高成绩。他指出，许多儿童在大流行前学业成绩良好，但仍获得很高的成绩，尽管他承认其他“以前在学校苦苦挣扎的孩子”。 。 。继续这样做。”</p><p> Brabrand added in a statement: “We are working on identifying these students by name and by need and are working on specific interventions to support them right now and as we phase back in person.”</p><p>Brabrand在声明中补充说：“我们正在努力按姓名和需求来识别这些学生，并正在采取具体的干预措施以支持他们，并当面逐步撤离。”</p><p>  Fairfax returned several thousand students to school buildings over the course of the fall, prioritizing students with disabilities, those whose primary language is not English and prekindergarten through elementary students. But as cases rose in the Washington area, the superintendent this month halted plans for further returns and sent some groups back to all virtual learning.</p><p>  秋季，费尔法克斯（Fairfax）将数千名学生送回了校舍，对残疾学生进行了优先处理，这些残疾学生的主要语言不是英语，而小学之前是幼儿园和幼儿园。但是随着华盛顿地区案件的增多，该负责人本月暂停了进一步返回的计划，并将一些小组送回了所有虚拟学习机构。</p><p>  On Monday, Brabrand announced that nearly 3,000 more students — elementary-schoolers and high school students taking career and technical classes — would return to online-only instruction.</p><p>  周一，布拉布兰德宣布，将有近3,000名学生（包括参加职业和技术课程的小学生和高中学生）将返回在线教学。</p><p>  He said Fairfax has already tried to help struggling children by instituting “catch-up days” and extending the first-quarter grading period. The school system also revised its student workload to make it less onerous this semester, for example  instructing teachers to give students no more than one hour per week of homework for each course.</p><p>  他说，费尔法克斯已经尝试通过设立“补习日”并延长第一季度的评分时间来帮助挣扎的儿童。学校系统还修改了学生的工作量，以减轻本学期的繁重工作，例如，指示老师给每个课程每周不超过一小时的家庭作业。</p><p>  And the school system adjusted grading: Fairfax teachers are supposed to provide “additional flexibility” on deadlines, to accommodate student absences without penalizing them and to allow ample opportunities for test retakes, according to  guidance posted online.</p><p>  并且学校系统调整了等级：根据在线发布的指南，费尔法克斯（Fairfax）的教师应该在截止日期前提供“额外的灵活性”，以适应学生的缺勤情况而不会对他们造成惩罚，并为他们提供充足的重考机会。</p><p> But one Fairfax high school teacher, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from the school system, said he is doing all of these things — and still, 50 to 70 percent of his 150 students are achieving D’s and F’s, whereas before they had earned B’s and C’s.</p><p> 但是一位不愿透露姓名的费尔法克斯高中老师担心会受到学校系统的报复。他说，他正在做所有这些事情，尽管如此，他的150名学生中有50％到70％取得了D和F。在他们获得B和C之前。</p><p>  This teacher is pursuing a very generous late policy, he said. And whenever he finds out that a student is facing extreme circumstances at home — for example, the student who was evicted from his home midway through the pandemic, or the other student whose father recently got the  coronavirus — he sits down with the child to develop an adjusted work schedule.</p><p>  他说，这名老师正在执行非常慷慨的后期政策。而且，每当他发现某个学生在家里面临极端情况时，例如，在大流行途中被驱逐出家的学生，或者另一位父亲最近感染了冠状病毒的学生，他都会与孩子坐下来发展调整后的工作时间表。</p><p>  The problem is that students do not always tell him of their troubles. And, like his colleagues, he teaches far too many children to be able to sit down individually with every one of them to investigate their home life and then plan an individualized course of study. Nor can he relax standards entirely, because then he wouldn’t be doing his job as a teacher and making sure children learn.</p><p>问题是学生们并不总是将自己的烦恼告诉他。而且，像他的同事一样，他教太多的孩子，无法与每个孩子单独坐下来调查家庭生活，然后计划个性化的学习课程。他也不能完全放宽标准，因为那样他就不会做老师并确保孩子们学习。</p><p> “I’m working multiple extra hours per week to figure out ways to bridge the gap and get the kids where they need to be,” he said. “It really is exhausting. Co-workers of mine, usually some of the most energetic and vivacious, are worn down, too.”</p><p> 他说：“我每周要多工作几个小时，以找出弥合差距并让孩子们到需要的地方的方法。” “真的很累。我的同事们，通常都是一些精力充沛，精力充沛的同事，也很疲倦。”</p><p>  Bob Farrace, spokesman for the National Association of Secondary School Principals, said educators nationwide are undergoing similar trials — and pushing themselves to the brink of breakdown to keep students learning and achieving in the classroom.</p><p>  全国中学校长协会发言人鲍勃·法拉斯（Bob Farrace）表示，全国的教育工作者正在接受类似的考验-并将自己推向崩溃的边缘，以保持学生在课堂上的学习和成就。</p><p>  “But with so many challenges at once,” he said, “it’s like they’re holding back a tidal wave with a broom.”</p><p>  他说：“但同时面临许多挑战，就好像他们用扫帚阻止了潮流一样。”</p><p> Farrace said he is hearing about spikes in D’s and F’s from superintendents across the country. The Fairfax report, compiled over the past few weeks by the school system’s research arm, offers a window into how the consequences of online learning differ by things children have no control over: race, learning ability or whether they were born into English-speaking households.</p><p> Farrace表示，他正在听到全国各地的院长听到D和F激增的消息。 Fairfax报告是由学校系统研究部门在过去几周内编制的，它提供了一个窗口，了解在线学习的后果因孩子无法控制的事情而异：种族，学习能力或他们是否生于讲英语的家庭。</p><p> Younger Fairfax students are struggling more than older ones: The percentage of middle-schoolers receiving at least two F’s quadrupled, while the percentage of high-schoolers scoring at least two F’s increased by 50 percent. The percentage of students with disabilities earning at least two F’s, meanwhile, more than doubled, while the percentage of children for whom English is a second language receiving at least two F’s rose by 106 percent to account for 35 percent of all children in this group.</p><p> 较年轻的费尔法克斯学生挣扎不止：至少获得两个F的中学生的比例增加了三倍，而获得至少两个F的高中学生的比例则增加了50％。同时，获得至少两个F的残疾学生比例增加了一倍以上，而英语为第二语言的孩子至少获得两个F的比例上升了106％，占该组所有儿童的35％ 。</p><p>  Among racial groups, Hispanic students were most affected: The percentage of these students with at least two F’s jumped from 13 to 25 percent.</p><p>  在种族群体中，西班牙裔学生受影响最大：这些学生中至少有两个F的比例从13％上升到25％。</p><p> Comparing grades achieved in past years with grades this year showed that the drop in passing grades is significant and unprecedented. The likelihood of passing an English class decreased by 40 percent this year for all students, according to the analysis, while the likelihood of passing mathematics decreased by 30 percent.</p><p>将过去几年取得的成绩与今年的成绩进行比较表明，及格分数的下降是巨大的，而且是前所未有的。分析显示，今年所有学生通过英语课程的可能性降低了40％，而通过数学的可能性降低了30％。</p><p> Student achievement is seriously off track in these two subjects from what would have been expected based on past performance. According to the analysis, 35 percent of all Fairfax students are underperforming in math, and 39 percent are underperforming in English.</p><p> 根据过去的表现，这两个科目的学生成绩严重偏离了预期。根据分析，所有Fairfax学生的35％在数学方面表现不佳，而39％的英语表现不佳。</p><p>  Again, the dip is especially severe among vulnerable children and those for whom English is not their first language. Students with disabilities and Hispanic students both saw large spikes in underperformance, compared with other demographic groups studied.</p><p>  同样，在弱势儿童和英语不是母语的儿童中，这种下降尤为严重。与其他受调查的人群相比，残疾学生和西班牙裔学生的学习成绩均出现大幅上升。</p><p> But by far the biggest drop came for learners whose primary language is not English: Forty-seven percent are underperforming in math this year, while 53 percent are underperforming in English.</p><p> 但是到目前为止，降幅最大的是母语不是英语的学习者：今年47％的学生数学成绩不佳，而53％的学生英语成绩不佳。</p><p> Fairfax mother Rocio Portillo, 35, said she was saddened but not surprised by the report. That’s because of what happened this semester to her daughter, a 17-year-old high school junior.</p><p> 费尔法克斯（Fairfax）的母亲罗西奥·波蒂略（Rocio Portillo）今年35岁，她对报告感到难过，但并不感到惊讶。这是因为这学期她17岁的高中女儿女儿发生了什么事情。</p><p> The teen achieved mostly A’s and B’s pre-pandemic. She was on track to fulfill her dream of studying forensic psychology in a four-year college. That wish is shared by her mother, who never finished college.</p><p> 十几岁的青少年大都达到了A和B的大流行前期。她正按计划实现在四年制大学中学习法医心理学的梦想。她的母亲从未完成大学学业，她也有这个愿望。</p><p> Then online learning hit. The teen cried every day during the first week this semester because she finds Zoom school nearly impossible to follow: The format is confusing and some teachers talk too fast. Despite hours of studying every day, her grades have slipped to C’s and one F.</p><p> 然后在线学习大受欢迎。这名少年在本学期的第一周每天都哭泣，因为她发现Zoom学校几乎无法实行：这种形式令人困惑，有些老师的讲话太快了。尽管每天学习时间都很多，但她的成绩却降到了C和F。</p><p>  “What breaks me is that I know she’s trying, I know she is giving it her all,” Portillo said. “She knows that college is important. She wants to be somebody in life.”</p><p>“让我感到震惊的是，我知道她正在努力，我知道她正在全力以赴，”波蒂略说。 “她知道大学很重要。她想成为人生中的一员。”</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/fairfax-schools-more-failing-grades/2020/11/24/1ac2412e-2e34-11eb-96c2-aac3f162215d_story.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/fairfax-schools-more-failing-grades/2020/11/24/1ac2412e-2e34-11eb-96c2-aac3f162215d_story.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/学生/">#学生</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/student/">#student</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
