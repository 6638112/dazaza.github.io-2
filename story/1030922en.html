He is currently pursuing personal interests and still living in Seattle.</p><p>谢尔·卡潘是亚马逊的第一位员工。他目前正在追求个人利益，仍住在西雅图。</p><p> Discussed: Getting Online, Prior Startups, Vetting Jeff Bezos, Moving to Seattle, Early Versions of Amazon, Finding Traction Through Netscape, Building the Company, Changing Roles, Life After Amazon.</p><p>讨论内容：上网，创业前，审查杰夫·贝佐斯，搬到西雅图，亚马逊的早期版本，通过网景寻找吸引力，建立公司，角色转换，亚马逊之后的生活。</p><p>   Shel : I worked as a programmer starting in 1975. My first real programming job was with an MIT spinoff called Information International, Inc. (also known as Triple-I) that was in Los Angeles, Culver City actually. I went there for a summer job in 1975. I was in college at the time, for the second time around, having dropped out once already, but stayed at Triple-I for three years. In 1978 I decided I should finish my undergraduate degree so I went back to school at UC Santa Cruz for a while and stayed in Northern California until I moved up to Seattle.</p><p>谢尔：我从1975年开始做程序员。我的第一份真正的编程工作是在麻省理工学院的一个叫信息国际公司的分支机构工作。(也被称为Triple-I)那是在洛杉矶，实际上是卡尔弗城。1975年我去那里打暑期工。当时我是第二次上大学，已经退学过一次，但在三一中学呆了三年。1978年，我决定完成我的本科学位，所以我回到加州大学圣克鲁斯分校上学一段时间，一直呆在北加州，直到我搬到西雅图。</p><p>  Shel : In early 1994, I had been working at a company called Kaleida Labs, which was a joint venture of Apple and IBM. I left there in the spring of 1994. One of the younger guys who had recently come out of university showed me Mosaic, which was brand new back then. The first time I got onto the the ARPANET, the precursor to the Internet as we know it, was 1969 or 70. I always had the feeling that there was something incredibly cool about it, but for some reason very few people seemed to think it was all that exciting. I couldn’t really imagine where it was all going to go eventually.</p><p>谢尔：1994年初，我在一家名为卡莱达实验室的公司工作，这是苹果和IBM的合资企业。我在1994年春天离开了那里。一位刚从大学毕业的年轻人给我看了马赛克，那是当时全新的。我第一次进入ARPANET(我们所知的互联网的前身)是在1969年或70年。我总觉得它有一些不可思议的酷的东西，但出于某种原因，似乎很少有人认为它有那么令人兴奋。我真的无法想象这一切最终会走向何方。</p><p> When I saw Mosaic, something clicked and I knew the Internet was finally going to open up to a much wider audience. Having missed a couple of earlier waves of technology that didn’t seem that interesting to me at the time, I thought this wave was one that was really going to be interesting and I wanted to do something with it. I didn’t know exactly what, but I knew I wanted to be involved. There were already a few new web-related businesses hiring some of the hotshots that I knew at the time. Netscape had been founded and some people I knew were already working there. It didn’t seem like a good fit for me, if I even could have gotten a job there. I wanted to do a startup and be more involved in the early phases of a business.</p><p>当我看到“马赛克”的时候，有些东西被点击了，我知道互联网最终会向更广泛的受众开放。在错过了之前的几波技术浪潮后，当时我似乎并不那么感兴趣，我认为这一波真的会很有趣，我想利用它做点什么。我不知道具体是什么，但我知道我想参与进来。已经有一些新的网络相关企业雇佣了一些我当时认识的能手。网景公司已经成立了，我认识的一些人已经在那里工作了。即使我能在那里找到一份工作，它似乎也不太适合我。我想做一家初创公司，更多地参与企业的早期阶段。</p><p> I was kicking around ideas with a friend of mine in Santa Cruz, who I had worked with at Frox and then Xerox, Herb Jellinek, trying to figure out some business idea that would be attractive to us that we could work on together–one that we thought might possibly work. We started talking to various people in our networks. Herb had gone to grad school at Stanford and one of his friends from there had gone to work at a hedge fund in New York, which happened to be the same one where Jeff Bezos worked at the time. He connected us with Jeff because he knew that Jeff was going to leave to start a web-related business that he had analyzed for this hedge fund. For whatever reason, that company didn’t want to pursue it but Jeff did.</p><p>我和我在圣克鲁斯的一个朋友一起讨论想法，他曾和我一起在Frox工作，然后是施乐公司的Herb Jellinek，试图找出一些对我们有吸引力的商业想法，我们可以一起工作-一个我们认为可能可行的想法。我们开始与我们网络中的各种人交谈。赫布曾就读于斯坦福大学的研究生院，他在那里的一个朋友去了纽约的一家对冲基金工作，恰好就是杰夫·贝佐斯当时工作的那家公司。他把我们和杰夫联系在一起，因为他知道杰夫要离开去创办一家他曾为这家对冲基金分析过的网络相关企业。不管出于什么原因，那家公司不想追求它，但杰夫想要。</p><p> Herb talked to Jeff, and then Jeff flew out to meet us in Santa Cruz. We had breakfast together and Jeff told us about his idea to start an online bookstore. We were even talking about possibly locating it in Santa Cruz. This was in spring of ‘94. Jeff went back home to New York and started thinking about where he wanted to locate. We were looking at office space in Santa Cruz but as he learned more about mail-order business he eventually decided it made more sense to be in a smaller population state or one that didn’t charge sales tax. He narrowed it down to someplace in Nevada or Seattle. I pretty much knew that I wasn’t going to be moving to Nevada. When he finally decided on Seattle, it took him all summer to convince me to move because I had lived in Santa Cruz for nearly 20 years and I liked it there.</p><p>赫伯和杰夫谈过了，然后杰夫飞到圣克鲁斯和我们会合。我们一起吃早餐，杰夫告诉我们他开一家网上书店的想法。我们甚至在讨论可能把它定位在圣克鲁斯。这是九四年的春天。杰夫回到纽约的家中，开始考虑他想要找的地方。我们在寻找圣克鲁斯的办公场所，但随着他对邮购业务有了更多的了解，他最终决定去一个人口较少的州或一个不征收销售税的州更有意义。他把范围缩小到内华达州或西雅图的某个地方。我几乎知道我不会搬到内华达州去。当他最终决定搬到西雅图时，他花了整个夏天才说服我搬家，因为我在圣克鲁斯住了近20年，我喜欢那里。</p><p> Eventually, I decided that there was enough that I wanted to do on the project that it made sense to move. Herb, who had only recently moved to Santa Cruz, decided to stay. At first I was a little bit tentative about it–I kept my house in Santa Cruz and I only moved the minimum amount of stuff I needed to live.</p><p>最终，我决定在这个项目上我有足够的事情要做，搬家是有意义的。赫伯最近才搬到圣克鲁斯，他决定留下来。一开始我有点犹豫--我把我在圣克鲁斯的房子留了下来，我只搬走了我生活所需的最低限度的东西。</p><p> At the time I thought, “Okay, I’m going to be building this website to run a bookstore and I haven’t done that before but it doesn’t sound so hard. When I’m done with that I’m not sure what I’ll do.” At that point there was no idea of doing anything but a bookstore. I thought maybe I would be able to go back to Santa Cruz and monitor it from there. I was pretty wrong about how the business would develop and how ambitious Jeff was. I didn’t know him at the time. We had just met.</p><p>当时我想，“好吧，我要建这个网站来经营书店，我以前没这么做过，但听起来并不难。当我做完这件事时，我不确定我会做什么。“。在这一点上，除了开书店，什么都不想做。我想也许我可以回到圣克鲁斯，从那里监视它。我对公司将如何发展以及杰夫的雄心壮志大错特错。当时我不认识他。我们才刚认识。</p><p> Craig : How did you vet each other? Was he technical? Had you worked with many entrepreneurs before?</p><p>克雷格：你们是怎么审查对方的？他是技术人员吗？你以前和很多企业家合作过吗？</p><p> Shel : I’d worked in a few different startups. We both gave each other references to check out. But I think my choice was mostly based on the sense I had that he was fairly likely to make something work. I had been in a number of startups where there was an absence of people with sufficient business intelligence who understood how to fundraise, market something, and make business plans that weren’t based on hopelessly complicated technology that was super interesting but that nobody was ever going to pay for. I liked the idea that it was a very straightforward sounding business. I liked that I could explain to people who the customers were likely to be, what they were going to be paying for, and how the company could pay its own way.</p><p>谢尔：我在几家不同的初创公司工作过。我们都给对方提供了退房推荐人。但我认为，我的选择主要是基于我的感觉，即他很可能会让一些事情奏效。我曾经在一些初创公司工作过，那里缺乏具有足够商业智慧的人，他们知道如何筹集资金、营销某些东西，以及制定商业计划，这些计划并不基于极其复杂的技术，这些技术非常有趣，但从来没有人会为之买单。我喜欢这个想法，那就是这是一项听起来非常直截了当的生意。我喜欢我可以向人们解释客户可能是谁，他们将为什么买单，以及公司如何支付自己的费用。</p><p> I liked the guy when I met him. He has a very engaging personality. I was excited about the project so there were other reasons too besides the people involved. At the time there was this confluence of networking, hypertext, graphics and all this stuff that was coming into play with the web for the first time.</p><p>我见到他的时候很喜欢他。他有一个非常迷人的个性。我对这个项目很兴奋，所以除了参与的人之外，还有其他原因。当时，网络、超文本、图形和所有这些第一次与网络一起发挥作用的东西汇聚在一起。</p><p> I wanted to take  Books In Print or something like it and make a hypertext version. I’d been thinking about that before I even met Jeff. I wasn’t thinking about it in the context of selling books, but I was thinking, “Man, I hate going to the library and ruffling through those card catalogues and trying to find that thing that I’m looking for.” Nobody alive probably remembers that anymore. You actually had to go through drawers full of index cards to find books you were interested in. Then you’d walk around the library and browse the shelves to see if maybe the thing you’re interested in would be nearby.</p><p>我想把印刷的书或类似的东西做成一个超文本版本。在我见到杰夫之前我就已经在想这件事了。我没有从卖书的角度来考虑这件事，但我在想，“伙计，我讨厌去图书馆翻阅那些卡片目录，试图找到我正在寻找的东西。”可能现在活着的人都不记得了。实际上，你必须翻遍装满索引卡的抽屉才能找到你感兴趣的书。然后你会绕着图书馆走一圈，浏览一下书架，看看你感兴趣的东西是否会在附近。</p><p> I thought solving that problem was a perfect application for hypertext. There were a couple other online bookstores popping up around that time, too. Nobody seemed to grasp that issue particularly well. So, I thought, “Okay, well, I really want to build this and this project is a chance for me to do it.” Plus, I had worked just after high school in a mail order operation that sold books and other things, so I felt like I was going back to my roots, and that also felt good.</p><p>我认为解决这个问题是超文本的完美应用。大约在那个时候，也有几家其他的在线书店如雨后春笋般涌现出来。似乎没有人特别理解这个问题。所以，我想，“好吧，好吧，我真的很想建造这个项目，这个项目是我做这件事的一个机会。”另外，我高中刚毕业就在一家卖书和其他东西的邮购公司工作，所以我感觉自己回到了自己的本源，这也让我感觉很好。</p><p> Craig : What was the first thing you guys had to build to get started?</p><p>克雷格：你们要开始做的第一件事是什么？</p><p> Shel : Well, there was basically nothing except for a little library from NCSA of primitive things that you could use to build slightly interactive websites. I started by building up machines and getting a database system and putting together a little development environment. There weren’t any cloud services or anything like that at the time. It was all build your own and run it yourself. There was precious little in the way of tools or development environments for web stuff or libraries to build things out of. It was all cobbled together. At that point the web was a very static thing–mostly just a collection of pages.</p><p>SHEL：嗯，除了NCSA提供的一个原始库之外，基本上什么都没有，你可以用它来建立稍微互动的网站。我从构建机器和数据库系统开始，然后组装了一个小小的开发环境。当时还没有任何云服务或类似的服务。这一切都是你自己建造，自己运营的。在工具或开发环境方面，几乎没有什么工具或开发环境可以用来构建Web内容或库。这一切都是胡乱拼凑起来的。在这一点上，网络是一个非常静态的东西--基本上只是一个页面的集合。</p><p> There were hooks in the HTTP servers for running scripts, which is what we were depending on because all of our pages had to be dynamically generated. There was really nothing that existed to build a stateful application. In other words, where you are serving different things to different people and you have to keep track of that person’s progress, as they’re adding things to a shopping basket and going through an ordering process and all that. We pretty much had to figure that out and learn how to do it.</p><p>HTTP服务器中有用于运行脚本的挂钩，这是我们所依赖的，因为我们所有的页面都必须动态生成。实际上没有什么东西可以构建有状态的应用程序。换句话说，你为不同的人提供不同的东西，你必须跟踪那个人的进展，因为他们正在把东西加到购物篮里，经历一个订购过程等等。我们几乎必须弄清楚这一点，并学习如何做到这一点。</p><p> Craig : How did you troubleshoot? Today I use Stack Overflow constantly. What would you do when you ran into a bug that you couldn’t figure out?</p><p>克雷格：你是怎么排除故障的？今天我经常使用堆栈溢出。当你遇到一个你找不到的bug时，你会怎么做？</p><p>   Shel : I don’t recall that we had a lot of help from outside parties. At one point we decided to switch from Sun Microsystems to Digital servers. I was more familiar with Sun’s machines at that time so when we got the Digital machines and had some performance issues at first, Jeff found a professor at UW who could help with kernel tuning, which I was not terribly familiar with.</p><p>谢尔：我不记得我们从外面得到过很多帮助。我们一度决定从Sun Microsystems切换到数字服务器。当时我对Sun的机器比较熟悉，所以当我们买到数字机器，一开始遇到一些性能问题时，Jeff找到了UW的一位教授，他可以帮助我进行内核调优，而我对此并不是很熟悉。</p><p> Everything else was debugging as usual. Technically speaking, Amazon was really pretty straightforward to build in the beginning. Although believe me, we had our share of bugs. But they were mostly relatively straightforward.</p><p>其他一切都在照常调试。从技术上讲，亚马逊一开始建立起来真的很简单。尽管相信我，我们也有自己的虫子。但它们大多相对直截了当。</p><p>  Shel : A month after I got there we hired a guy named Paul Davis who had been in the Computer Science staff at UW, and who was a really great hacker. He and I worked together quite well. I was mostly focused on the website and customer-facing stuff. He was primarily focusing on shipping, receiving, inventory, charging credit cards and all that kind of thing. But we both had our hands on all of the code. He only stayed for a year and a quarter or so. When he left, it was just me for several months before I could hire anybody else. I was doing all of it at that point in time. I remember I worked seven days a week for 3 months straight, and they weren’t 8-hour days. Then we started hiring a few people who could take over specific aspects of the code.</p><p>谢尔：我到那里一个月后，我们雇了一个叫保罗·戴维斯的人，他曾在威斯康星州大学的计算机科学部门工作，他是一个非常棒的黑客。他和我合作得很好。我主要集中在网站和面向客户的东西上。他主要专注于发货、接收、库存、给信用卡充值以及诸如此类的事情。但我们都拿到了所有的代码。他只待了一年半左右。当他离开的时候，只有我一个人呆了几个月，然后我才能雇到其他人。在那个时间点上，我正在做所有的事情。我记得我连续3个月每周工作7天，而不是每天工作8小时。然后我们开始雇佣一些人，他们可以接管代码的特定方面。</p><p> Craig : Do you remember how many orders you were getting per month at the time?</p><p>克雷格：你还记得当时每个月有多少订单吗？</p><p> Shel : I don’t remember numbers but it was minuscule by today’s standards. That said, our business was doubling quarterly for about six quarters or more in a row. In the beginning before we got the Digital servers, we ran the whole business on a couple of small Sun desktop machines. That was everything. We didn’t have much of a budget for hardware. We were trying to get absolutely everything we could out of a small number of tiny machines. We were always a little bit behind the curve on adding more hardware as we needed it.</p><p>谢尔：我记不清数字了，但按照今天的标准，它是微不足道的。也就是说，我们的业务连续六个季度或更长时间季度翻了一番。最初，在我们获得数字服务器之前，我们在几台小型Sun台式机上运行整个业务。这就是一切。我们没有太多的硬件预算。我们试图从一小部分微小的机器中得到我们所能得到的一切。我们总是在需要时添加更多硬件方面有点落后。</p><p>  Shel : Yeah, for sure. We were always up against the limit of what the hardware could do. For one reason or another, sorting out architectural issues to scale more gracefully was something I could never convince Jeff to allocate resources to do. There were always too many customer-facing features that needed to be developed.</p><p>夏尔：是的，当然可以。我们总是遇到硬件所能做到的极限。出于这样或那样的原因，整理架构问题以更优雅地扩展是我永远无法说服Jeff分配资源来做的事情。总是有太多面向客户的功能需要开发。</p><p> There were times when some piece of hardware would crap out and corrupt a database and, of course, some of the backups hadn’t been working. But somehow we survived.</p><p>有时，某些硬件会出现故障并损坏数据库，当然，有些备份也不起作用。但不知何故我们活了下来。</p><p>  Shel : No. Not in the beginning. I think it was maybe spring or summer of 1997 when the first people came in that were starting to work on that. In the beginning we were saving our server logs thinking they’d be really interesting to analyze, but not right now.</p><p>谢尔：没有。一开始不是。我想可能是在1997年的春天或夏天，当第一批人进来的时候，他们开始着手做这件事。一开始，我们保存服务器日志，认为分析它们会非常有趣，但现在不是这样。</p><p>   Craig : Exactly. So had you been working with Jeff on the product? How was the ship being steered?</p><p>克雷格：没错。那么你一直在和杰夫合作开发这个产品吗？船开得怎么样？</p><p> Shel : During that time we were just a bookstore, so it didn’t seem to me there was a lot of steering to be done. That said, I don’t know all the things that Jeff might have been doing that I wasn’t aware of at the time. If I think back, I can’t even clearly picture what it was that he was actually doing. He wasn’t working on any of the technical stuff. We never even had a written business plan that I know of.</p><p>谢尔：那段时间我们只是一家书店，所以在我看来没有太多的方向盘要做。也就是说，我不知道杰夫可能正在做的所有我当时没有意识到的事情。如果我回想起来，我甚至不能清楚地想象他到底在做什么。他没有做任何技术方面的工作。据我所知，我们甚至从来没有书面的商业计划。</p><p>  Shel : He wasn’t doing that. Well, maybe he was at the very, very beginning before we hired people to interact with publishers. At the very beginning we were mostly just working with distributors. But we wanted to have a large catalogue, so we also had to work directly with publishers who weren’t represented by the distributors. That was what allowed us to claim a million titles, which was a big deal back then.</p><p>雪儿：他不是那样做的。嗯，也许在我们雇佣人与出版商互动之前，他就处于非常非常开始的阶段。一开始，我们主要是与分销商合作。但我们希望有一个大的目录，所以我们还必须直接与没有经销商代表的出版商合作。这就是为什么我们可以获得一百万个冠军头衔，这在当时是一件大事。</p><p>  Shel : Well, Google wasn’t around at the time. There are probably other opinions about this but, first off, there weren’t that many websites that were interesting back then. Second, as it turned out, there was a couple who worked at Netscape at the time–Eric and Susan Benson. I had worked with Eric in three different places by then. We had a “friends and family” soft launch in the spring of ‘95. They were among the people that were trying it out. We later hired both of them at Amazon. Susan was working on Netscape’s website in an editorial capacity. I only learned this last year, but when we opened up to the public it was she who put Amazon on their “What’s New” and “What’s Cool” pages. She put us on those lists. Then because the name started with an A, it was above the fold so lots of people saw it. That was, in my opinion, a super important connection for us. It might have happened without the personal connection, but who knows, maybe not.</p><p>谢尔：嗯，那时候谷歌还不在。关于这一点可能还有其他观点，但首先，当时没有那么多有趣的网站。其次，事实证明，当时有一对夫妇在网景公司工作-埃里克和苏珊·本森(Eric Benson)和苏珊·本森(Susan Benson)。到那时，我已经和埃里克在三个不同的地方工作过。我们在95年春天进行了一次“朋友和家人”的软发布。他们是正在尝试它的人中的一员。我们后来在亚马逊雇佣了他们两人。苏珊以编辑的身份在网景公司的网站上工作。我去年才知道这一点，但当我们向公众开放时，是她把亚马逊放在了他们的“什么是新的”和“什么是酷的”页面上。她把我们放在那些名单上。然后因为这个名字是以A开头的，所以它在折叠处上面，所以很多人都看到了它。在我看来，这对我们来说是一个非常重要的联系。这可能是在没有个人联系的情况下发生的，但谁知道呢，也许不是。</p><p> Craig : That’s wild. Were you shipping to all 50 states in the beginning?</p><p>克雷格：那太疯狂了。刚开始的时候你是不是发往所有50个州？</p><p> Shel : Yeah, and several foreign countries as well. We had a lot of international orders from fairly early on.</p><p>谢尔：是的，还有几个国家。从相当早的时候起，我们就收到了很多国际订单。</p><p> Craig : At what point did you realize, “Maybe I shouldn’t keep my place in Santa Cruz. I might be at Amazon for a while.”</p><p>克雷格：你在什么时候意识到，“也许我不应该留在圣克鲁斯。我可能会在亚马逊待一段时间。“。</p><p> Shel : I think that happened two years in or so. It started to be annoying to have to manage the house remotely, even though it was a friend of mine who was renting it. I was still responsible for it. At that point I also thought, if I do move back there, I’m probably not going to live in that house. It was not a particularly great house. I decided it would make my life a little simpler to get rid of it.</p><p>谢尔：我想那是在两年左右的时间里发生的。不得不远程管理房子开始让人厌烦，尽管租房子的是我的一个朋友。我仍然对此负有责任。当时我还想，如果我真的搬回那里，我可能就不会住在那所房子里了。这不是一座特别棒的房子。我决定摆脱它会让我的生活变得简单一点。</p><p> At that time we started extending into different product areas, too. We started having sites in a couple of other countries. Germany and England were the first two. And we started to make acquisitions. I think the acquisitions were probably post-IPO, which was spring of ‘97.</p><p>那时我们也开始向不同的产品领域延伸。我们开始在其他几个国家开设网站。德国和英国是前两名。我们开始进行收购。我认为这些收购可能是在IPO后进行的，那是97年的春天。</p><p>    Shel : My role was always primarily technical with some technical management. At that time I was VP of Development and was responsible for writing the software and keeping the systems up and running. One of the people who were hired to replace me in my original role came in only a month or maybe two before the IPO. The next guy came in September of that year. Early on, the small team of technical folks had been working for me, and I was mainly doing a lot of programming myself, but also system administration, network configuration, and so forth. I was putting disk drives in enclosures and running Ethernet cabling around the building and that kind of thing.</p><p>谢尔：我的工作主要是技术方面的，还有一些技术管理方面的工作。当时我是开发副总裁，负责编写软件并保持系统正常运行。其中一位被雇来接替我最初角色的人是在IPO前一两个月来的。下一个人是在那年9月来的。早些时候，一小群技术人员一直在为我工作，我自己主要负责大量的编程工作，但也有系统管理、网络配置等工作。我把磁盘驱动器放在盘柜里，在大楼周围铺设以太网电缆，诸如此类的事情。</p><p>  Shel : Well, yeah. Those days were still before everything that’s happened with glorifying startups. If you were going to do a startup business, there wasn’t a huge expectation that it was going to be glamorous in any particular kind of way. You were going to work really hard and maybe it was going to work, though probably not.</p><p>谢尔：嗯，是的。那些日子还没有发生在美化初创企业的一切之前。如果你打算做一家初创企业，人们对它不会以任何特定的方式光彩照人抱有很高的期望。你会非常努力地工作，也许会奏效，但也可能不会。</p><p>  Shel : Up until recently, maybe a few years ago, I could have said yes. But I don’t really see anything that looks like it now. It seems highly unlikely that anything I did actually still exists over there anymore.</p><p>谢尔：直到最近，也许是几年前，我还可以说“是”。但我现在真的看不到任何看起来像它的东西。我所做的一切似乎都不太可能在那里继续存在了。</p><p> Craig : What about even design patterns? Like, this is how a shopping cart works.</p><p>克雷格：那设计模式呢？就像，这就是购物车的工作原理。</p><p> Shel : I don’t remember learning that from some other website. Though it seems like, as soon as you start thinking about that problem, it’s self-evident what it has to be like. You don’t want to make people go through a transaction every time they pick something. You have to let people go through the site and pick things that they’re interested in, put them somewhere so they can come back and get it all shipped at some point. I remember doing a lot of framing of that process on the website. Putting in text that said you could always take this out of your shopping basket later if you change your mind. So people wouldn’t feel they were overly committed.</p><p>谢尔：我不记得是从别的网站上知道的。虽然看起来，一旦你开始思考这个问题，就不言而喻了。你不想让人们每次挑选东西都要进行交易。你必须让人们浏览网站，挑选他们感兴趣的东西，把它们放在某个地方，这样他们就可以回来，在某个时候把它们全部运出去。我记得我在网站上做了很多关于这个过程的框定。在短信中写道，如果你改变主意，以后随时可以把这个从购物篮里拿出来。这样人们就不会觉得自己承诺过头了。</p><p> Back in those days nobody was used to being a customer of online businesses. You had to be careful to make people feel comfortable and let them know their actions were reversible. Even though I was mainly doing technical things, the appearance of the website and a lot of the text on it were my doing in the early days. I was careful about making things acceptable to what I understood the culture of internet users to be in those days.</p><p>在那些日子里，没有人习惯于成为在线企业的客户。你必须小心让人们感到舒适，让他们知道他们的行为是可逆的。虽然我主要是做技术上的事情，但是网站的出现和上面的很多文字都是我早期做的。我小心翼翼地让事情符合我对当时互联网用户文化的理解。</p><p> Craig : That’s so wild. You were designing for a completely different level of knowledge. You can assume so much more today.</p><p>克雷格：那太疯狂了。你的设计目标是完全不同的知识水平。今天你可以假设得更多。</p><p> Shel : Yes. Absolutely. Back in those days, it was the very beginning of doing commerce on the internet. There was a whole debate around allowing commercial activity on the internet. At least that’s how I recall it. Many people online were like, “We’re not so sure about commerce on this thing. You better not overdo it. You better be tasteful.”</p><p>夏尔：是的。绝对一点儿没错。在那些日子里，这是在互联网上做商业的刚刚开始。围绕允许互联网上的商业活动进行了一场完整的辩论。至少我记得是这样的。许多人在网上说，“我们不太确定这件事的商业前景。你最好不要做过头。你最好是有品位的。“。</p><p> There were these cases where people doing overtly commercial things were chastised by the community at large. There were some lawyers advertising their services for getting Green Cards and they were doing it by massive spamming activities. It created a huge fuss back then. It’s laughable now because so much stuff like that happens all the time.</p><p>在这些情况下，公开做商业活动的人会受到社会的普遍谴责。有一些律师为获得绿卡的服务做广告，他们通过大量的垃圾邮件活动来做到这一点。这在当时引起了很大的轰动。现在很可笑，因为这样的事情时有发生。</p><p> And when cookies started being a feature in web browsers a lot of people were really concerned about their privacy, so they would turn them off. So we had to figure out how to make things work without that. Some people were running text-only browsers back then. Plus they were on dial-up. Sending pictures was not a good thing for those people.</p><p>当Cookie开始成为网络浏览器的一项功能时，很多人真的很担心他们的隐私，所以他们会关闭它们。所以我们必须想办法在没有它的情况下如何运作。当时有些人运行的是纯文本浏览器。再加上他们在拨号上网。发照片对那些人来说不是一件好事。</p><p>  Shel : Yeah, we tested it. It always seemed important for us to make things continue to work, even for people that didn’t have a high bandwidth connection or the latest and greatest computers and all that.</p><p>雪儿：是的，我们测试过了。对我们来说，让事情继续运转似乎总是很重要的，即使对那些没有高带宽连接或没有最新最好的计算机之类的人来说也是如此。</p><p>   Craig : At the time you left, was it still a bookstore? What was it like?</p><p>克雷格：你离开的时候，它还是一家书店吗？它是什么样子的？</p><p> Shel : Well, they had branched out into several other product areas. There weren’t any digital products yet. Ebooks hadn’t happened yet. They hadn’t developed any hardware products yet. Their computing services were not public yet. It was still pretty much a retail business. Although it was definitely branching out into other product areas and other countries.</p><p>谢尔：嗯，他们已经扩展到其他几个产品领域了。当时还没有任何数码产品。电子书还没有出现。他们还没有开发出任何硬件产品。他们的计算服务还没有公开。这在很大程度上仍然是一项零售业务。虽然它肯定是扩展到其他产品领域和其他国家。</p><p> Also around the time of an IPO and afterwards, the kind of people that are attracted to go to a company changes a lot. There were boatloads of MBAs and people like that coming. It was already a big company from my perspective.</p><p>同样在IPO前后，被吸引去一家公司的人也会发生很大变化。有一船的MBA和像这样的人来了。在我看来，这已经是一家大公司了。</p><p> Craig : So you’ve observed all these technological shifts. Do you have thoughts about how people should evaluate technologies when they’re about to start building something?</p><p>克雷格：所以你观察到了所有这些技术变革。你有没有想过，当人们即将开始建造一些东西时，他们应该如何评估技术？</p><p> Shel : At this point, I don’t know. It’s a huge subject. For myself, when I look at technology these days, I see that it’s either doing something to connect people or it’s doing something that isolates people. I tend to make value judgments based on that kind of consideration about what is worth working on.</p><p>雪儿：在这一点上，我不知道。这是一个很大的课题。就我自己而言，如今当我看着技术的时候，我发现它要么是在做一些连接人们的事情，要么是在做一些孤立人们的事情。我倾向于基于这样的考虑做出价值判断，即什么是值得努力的。</p><p> You walk down the streets, you have to weave around people standing there in random orientations in the middle of the sidewalk looking at their cellphones. Then you see people speaking robotically so that their speech recognizer can understand them. Now they are running around in mobs in parks with their phones in front of them trying to catch imaginary animals. I don’t necessarily see all that as a positive development.</p><p>你走在街上，你不得不绕着站在人行道中央看手机的随机方向站着的人。然后你会看到人们用机器人说话，这样他们的语音识别器就能听懂了。现在，他们正在公园里的暴徒中跑来跑去，手机放在他们面前，试图捕捉虚构的动物。我不一定认为所有这些都是积极的发展。</p><p> I think technology has a role to play but I don’t see it being exploited very carefully in that way. But this is the kind of economy that we live in. And it’s very, very addictive. Even people who complain about it are still subject to it.</p><p>我认为技术是可以发挥作用的，但我不认为它会以这种方式被非常仔细地利用。但这就是我们生活的那种经济。而且它非常非常容易上瘾。即使是抱怨它的人也仍然受到它的影响。</p><p>  Shel : I think that a lot of what they do is more on the isolating people side. Everything caters to convenience so much that you don’t even have to get out of bed to take care of your day-to-day business. To me, that’s a step too far. Of all the major online businesses, I don’t really think that they extend in that way much beyond what we did very early on by allowing for customer reviews.</p><p>谢尔：我认为他们所做的很多事情更多的是在孤立人们方面。所有的东西都非常方便，你甚至都不用起床来处理日常事务了。对我来说，这一步走得太远了。在所有主要的在线业务中，我真的不认为它们会以这种方式延伸到我们很早就允许客户评论的方式之外。</p><p>  Shel : Not really. When he replaced me in my original job and I was moved into </p><p>谢尔：不太喜欢。当他取代了我原来的工作，我被搬进了</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div
