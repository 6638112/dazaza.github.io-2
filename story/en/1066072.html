When it happened, I was expecting to be spoken to by a cat.</p><p>当我第一次遇到狐狸时。发生在发生时，我期待用猫说话。</p><p> One of the most wonderful things about walking through north London in the early mornings is the many outside cats who loiter around. Sometimes when they’re perched in rows on top of houses and walls, I feel as if they’re welcoming me into their realm. Other times, they seemed to be judging me for encroaching on it.</p><p> 关于在清晨穿越北伦敦的最美妙的事情之一是躲避周围的许多外部猫。有时，当他们在房屋和墙壁上栖息在行上时，我觉得他们觉得他们欢迎我进入他们的境界。其他时候，他们似乎正在判断我侵犯它。</p><p> Walking through this imagined animal kingdom feels more surreal on nights I’ve been out partying with friends. The walk home becomes an intoxicated glide through the streets, alone but for a few individuals coming back from work and others leaving for early shifts. On those nights, I feel as if I’m lingering on the edge of some wonderland, a magic world to which I might be granted access by a sudden word from one of the cats, that I might suddenly hear one asking me calmly if I had lost my way.</p><p> 走过这个想象的动物王国，感觉更令人满意的夜晚我已经和朋友一起开过派对。步行回家通过街道成为一个醉人的滑行，单独，但是对于从工作中回来的一些人以及离开早期班次的人。在那些夜晚，我觉得我似乎在一些仙境的边缘挥之不去，我可能会被其中一只猫突然的单词获得访问的魔术世界，我可能会突然听到一个人，如果我，我可能会平静地问我迷失了自己的方式。</p><p> Weeks before I met the fox, still hoping for a cat to speak, I told a friend about my love for foxes. To my surprise she said there was a good chance that I’d run into one in London. According to her, it’s harder to avoid foxes than to encounter them; they’re so numerous in the city that some people see them as equivalent to rodents. They dig through trash and sometimes attack cats, which naturally angers home and pet owners.</p><p> 在我遇到狐狸之前几周，仍希望一只猫说话，我告诉一位朋友对狐狸的爱。令我惊讶的是，她说有一个很好的机会，我会在伦敦遇到一个。根据她，避免狐狸比遇到它们更难;他们在城市中有很多人，有些人认为他们相当于啮齿动物。他们通过垃圾挖掘，有时攻击猫，自然愤怒地刺痛了家园和宠物主人。</p><p> I had always thought of foxes as creatures of the wild. In stories and nature shows about foxes, humans are rarely seen. It never occurred to me that to meet a fox, all I had to do was go to one of the most populous cities in the world and simply walk down the street. A conversation with a cat felt more possible.</p><p> 我一直认为狐狸作为野生的生物。在故事和自然展示关于狐狸，人类很少见。我从来没有发生过福克斯，我所要做的就是去世界上最多的城市之一，只需走在街上。与猫的谈话感到更有可能。</p><p> But there are reportedly over 10,000 red foxes in London, because urban expansion has destroyed their habitat over the years. In order to survive, the foxes moved into the city and learned to live around humans. City life has its benefits: there’s always plenty of wasted food to go around, and it’s easier to find shelter with so many structures and alleyways. But the city comes with unique dangers, from traffic to the violence and cruelty of its human inhabitants. The same human race that took away their natural homes still punishes foxes for adapting to their new urban life.</p><p> 但是，据报道，伦敦超过了10,000多个红狐狸，因为城市扩张多年来摧毁了栖息地。为了生存，狐狸搬进了城市，学会了人类。城市生活有其益处：一直有很多浪费的食物来解决，并更容易找到拥有如此多的结构和小巷的庇护所。但该市具有独特的危险，从交通到暴力和虐待其人类居民。带走他们自然的家园的同样的人类仍然惩罚狐狸适应新的城市生活。</p><p>  the folklorist Hans-Jörg Uther once said; there are “more tales of the fox than of other animals, such as the dog or the wolf.” While in the modern Western world the fox seems to have become the incarnation of the cunning trickster – in the figure of Reynard and others – it has a vast and diverse literary history. Tricksters survive and thrive by manipulating others – friends, family, and enemies alike. The trickster is amoral and only works for its own self-interest: depending on perspective and outcome, it can be hero or villain.</p><p>  民俗主义者Hans-Jörg乌瑟尔曾经说过;狐狸比其他动物更加故事，如狗或狼。“在现代西方世界的同时，狐狸似乎已成为狡猾的诡计的化身 - 在Reynard和其他人的身影中 - 它具有巨大而多样化的文学史。 Traxsters通过操纵他人来生存和茁壮成长 - 朋友，家人和敌人。骗子是阿莫尔的，只适用于自己的自身利益：取决于视角和结果，它可以是英雄或恶棍。 </p><p> Early Christian and medieval thought painted the fox as a symbol of evil, as demonic when it wasn’t mischievous. As Saint Dunstan prayed, the devil tried to distract him by changing into a fox, to which Dunstan responded: “You are revealing how you usually behave: by your tricks you flatter the unwary so that you can devour them. Now get out of here, wretch, since Christ, who crushed the lion and the dragon with his heel, will overcome you by his grace through me, whether you’re a wolf or a fox.”</p><p>早期的基督徒和中世纪的想法将狐狸绘制为邪恶的象征，是恶魔般的恶魔。正如圣丹斯坦祈祷的那样，魔鬼试图通过改变狐狸来分散他的注意力，邓斯坦回答道：“你透露你通常如何表现：由你的伎俩，你令人难以置信，这样你就可以奉行。现在已经离开了，自基督以来，粉碎了狮子和龙的脚跟，将通过他的恩典克服你，无论你是狼还是狐狸，都会克服你。“</p><p> I knew a great number of fictional foxes before I ever met a real one. There was the fox Tod from  The Fox and the Hound, Swiper from Dora the Explorer, the Fantastic Mr. Fox, Disney’s Robin Hood, the foxes from  Redwall. And Japanese culture has myriad fox creatures, from the playful fox to the shape-shifting vixen and their own culturally specific evil and demonic foxes. In the anime  Ushio and Tora the antagonist, Hakumen no Mono, is a gigantic silver fox with nine tails, over two thousand years old, who is the physical embodiment of evil. During the final battle, one of the protagonists says that Hakumen tends to have his face down with his eyes looking upwards – a posture that an individual or animal takes when he’s ashamed. Hakumen doesn’t deny it. He tells the story of his birth, that when the world was created, good energy floated upwards and formed humans, and bad energy floated down and became him. His hatred of humanity comes from his envy that he was made corrupt and ugly, that he couldn’t be like them. In response to the revelation, he blinds himself and rages against the heroes.</p><p> 在我遇到真正的人之前，我知道了很多虚构的狐狸。来自狐狸和猎犬的狐狸Tod，从多拉的探险家，福克斯先生，迪士尼的罗宾汉，来自Redwall的狐狸。而日本文化有无数的狐狸生物，从顽皮的狐狸到塑造泼妇和他们自己的文化具体的邪恶和恶魔狐狸。在动漫Ushio和Tora敌人，Hakumen没有单声道，是一只巨大的银狐，九尾，超过两千岁，是邪恶的物理实施例。在最后的战斗中，其中一位主角说，Hakumen倾向于让他的眼睛朝上向上看 - 一个姿势，个人或动物在他惭愧时需要的姿势。 hakumen不会否认它。他讲述了他出生的故事，当世界的创造时，良好的能量向上漂浮，形成了人类，并且糟糕的能量漂浮着，成为他。他对人类的仇恨来自他嫉妒，他被腐败了，丑陋，他不能像他们一样。为了回应启示，他将自己蒙羞，并肆虐对英雄。</p><p> In   The Blue Fox by the Icelandic writer and musical artist Sjón, the idea of the fox as immoral and cunning is flipped when the fox engages with a human. The fox’s deceptive and clever nature suddenly becomes a way to avoid and survive the hunter. In encounters with humans, it is the fox who is the vulnerable one:</p><p> 在冰岛作家和音乐艺术家Sjón的蓝狐狸中，当福克斯与人类汇集时，狐狸的想法是不道德和狡猾的。福克斯的欺骗性和聪明的性质突然成为一种避免和生存猎人的方法。在与人类的遇到时，它是脆弱的狐狸：</p><p> Blue foxes are so curiously like stones that it is a matter for wonder. When they lie beside them in winter there is no hope of telling them apart from the rocks themselves; indeed, they’re far trickier than white foxes, which always cast a shadow or look yellow against the snow.</p><p> 蓝狐非常好奇地喜欢它是一个奇迹是一个问题。当他们在冬天躺在他们旁边时，没有希望从岩石上讲述它们;实际上，他们比白色狐狸更棘手，总是施放阴影或对雪看起来黄色。</p><p> A blue vixen lies tight against her stone, letting the snow drift over her on the windward side. She turns her rump to the weather, curls up and pokes her snout under her thigh, lowering her eyelids till there’s the merest hint of a pupil. And so she keeps an eye on the man who has not shifted since he took cover under the overhanging drift, here on the upper slopes of Asheimar, some eighteen hours ago. The snow has drifted and fallen over him until he resembles nothing so much as a hump of ruined wall.</p><p> 蓝色泼妇在靠在她的石头上紧紧抓住，让她在迎风方面漂移。她把臀部变成了天气，蜷缩起来，把她的鼻子卷起来，然后降低她的眼睑，直到瞳孔最不可思议。因此，她一直关注那些没有转移的人，因为他在悬垂漂移下覆盖的覆盖，这里在亚太赛的上层斜坡上，大约十八小时前。雪已经漂流并落在他身边，直到他像毁灭墙的驼峰一样。</p><p>  I was coming home around three in the morning, walking down a small street toward a passageway that usually had cats watching from the tops of both walls. I swayed along, hoping as ever to be invited into their world. In that blissful state of mind, I met a wounded cat going the opposite way. I took about three steps before I stopped. I knew what a cat looked like. What I had walked past was not a cat.</p><p>  我早上三点回家了，走下了一条小巷，朝着一条通常有猫从两面墙的顶部观看的通道。我摇摆不定，希望永远被邀请进入他们的世界。在那种幸福的心态，我遇到了一只受伤的猫走向相反的方式。在我停止之前，我大约三步。我知道猫看起来像什么。我走过的东西不是猫。</p><p> I turned slowly, not to scare the animal, and saw that my suspicion was right. It was a fox, an injured fox at that. It limped for a few steps before it also stopped and turned to look at me. I crouched in front of it. In that moment, it seemed that time was frozen, even as my heart was beating so fast. I had been so entranced by the idea of a magical world guarded by cats that I almost forgot the fox I had hoped to meet. The encounter with something fictional made real, the possibility of touching a real fox, was suddenly more enticing to me than anything.</p><p> 我慢慢变得慢慢地，不要吓唬动物，并看到我的怀疑是对的。这是一只狐狸，一个受伤的狐狸。它在它也停止并转向看着我之前，它跛行了几步。我蹲在它面前。在那一刻，似乎时间被冻结了，即使我的心脏跳动得这么快。我已经被猫守卫的神奇世界的想法所进入，我几乎忘记了我希望见面的狐狸。遇到虚构的东西真实的东西，触摸真正的狐狸的可能性，突然更加诱惑我而不是什么。 </p><p> Knowing about a fox, learning its behaviors and life through shows and books, was much different from seeing one. I had its different fictions in me, while inches away was the living flesh.</p><p>了解狐狸，通过节目和书籍学习其行为和生活，与看到一个有很大不同。我在我身上有不同的小说，而英寸则是生肉。</p><p> I knew that the fox was a wild animal. No matter how close it had been to humans in the city, it was not tame. Even the domesticated foxes I saw in videos retained a danger, a wildness, to them. That closeness to humans might have even made it more dangerous. Its injury was likely the consequence of being so close to human life, the continuation of that violence that destroyed its countryside home and pushed it to scavenge for survival. The small fox must have tangled with a human or a dog, or come in contact with a car. I knew that if I moved to touch it, it might well attack me in defense.</p><p> 我知道狐狸是野生动物。无论在城市的人类多么近，都没有驯服。即使是我在视频中看到的驯化狐狸也保留了危险，野性狂野。对人类的亲密关系可能甚至使它变得更加危险。它的伤害可能是如此接近人类生活的结果，这是摧毁其乡村家的暴力的延续，并将其推向清除生存。小狐狸必须用人或一只狗缠结，或者与汽车接触。我知道如果我搬到它，它可能会很好地攻击我的防守。</p><p> Yet how badly I wanted to reach out my hand and feel its fur. To touch its body, its face, its nose. I wanted to scoop up the injured, lonesome creature, to carry it back with me and nurse it to health. It needed help, and the more it limped down the street, the more likely it was to encounter further danger. I wanted to save it. To reach past the barrier of the fictional to the real. To truly know what a fox is.</p><p> 然而，我有多糟糕地伸出手，感觉毛皮。触摸它的身体，它的脸，鼻子。我想舀起受伤的寂寞的生物，随身携带它并将其护理到健康。它需要帮助，它偏离街道越多，遇到进一步危险的可能性就越有可能。我想拯救它。达到虚构的虚构障碍。真正知道狐狸是什么。</p><p> Even as I wanted to avoid it biting me, I wanted to feel its teeth. I wanted to be rejected by the wild. For the fox to remain a fox, wild and unattainable, even in the streets of London. For the blood it would draw from my hand to be evidence of the permanent barrier of strangeness, of human and animal, the line between fiction and reality, that existed between the two of us. I wanted to know a fox, and at the same time, to know that I could never know him.</p><p> 即使我想避免它咬我，我也想觉得它的牙齿。我想被野生拒绝。对于狐狸仍然是狐狸，狂野和无法实现的，即使在伦敦的街道上。对于血液来说，它将从我的手中汲取陌生人的惯性障碍，人类和动物，小说与现实之间的界限，在我们俩之间存在。我想知道一只狐狸，与此同时，知道我永远无法认识他。</p><p> The thrill of the encounter was part of enjoying the trickster, of not knowing its intentions. Would it come to me or betray me? Is betrayal even possible for a creature who was never meant to be grasped? The delight is in the horror of being lured into a trap, and the gratitude in being chosen to be part of its plans. The pain of being bitten and the joy of possibly knowing what it feels like to be bitten by a fox. Not only to see one, but to be marked by one.</p><p> 遭遇的兴奋是享受骗子的一部分，而不是了解其意图。它会来找我还是背叛我？对于从未意味着掌握的生物，甚至可能是可能的？喜悦是在被诱惑到陷阱中的恐怖，并且被选中的感激之情成为其计划的一部分。被咬伤的痛苦和可能知道被狐狸咬伤的感觉是什么感觉。不仅要看到一个，而且被一个标记。</p><p> I don’t know how long the fox and I looked at each other, but it finally broke the connection, turning and limping away. I was no use to it and its survival in the unforgiving concrete jungle. I stood and watched until it was out of sight, just as the cats sometimes watched me.</p><p> 我不知道狐狸多长时间，我互相看着彼此，但它终于打破了连接，转身和跛行。我对此并没有用过它的生存在未能的混凝土丛林中。我站着和看着，直到它看不见，就像猫有时候看着我一样。</p><p> I’ve seen many foxes in person since then, on other late nights as well as in the daytime. Once I’d seen the first one, the rest were revealed. I’m glad that I never touched it. To do that would somehow have been to take away what I admire most about the creatures, their elemental strangeness. Maybe that’s just another fiction, but I feel that it was correct to resist the human urge of contact, that drive to grasp and dominate every creature and part of the world. It was faithful to the nature of the animal to respect the distance that has inherently remained, even as more and more foxes move into the human world.</p><p> 从那以后，我见过很多狐狸，在其他深夜和白天。一旦我看到第一个，其余的揭示了。我很高兴我从来没有碰过它。要做到这一点，以某种方式拿走我最崇拜的生物，他们的元素陌生。也许这只是另一个小说，但我觉得抵抗人类的联系迫切是正确的，这是为了掌握并占据世界各地的每个生物和世界的主导。它忠于动物的性质，尊重固有留下的距离，即使越来越多的狐狸进入人类世界。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.plough.com/en/topics/justice/environment/the-elemental-strangeness-of-foxes">https://www.plough.com/en/topics/justice/environment/the-elemental-strangeness-of-foxes</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/元素/">#元素</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/狐狸/">#狐狸</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
