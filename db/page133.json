"note_en": "A version of this story appeared in CNN&#39;s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free   here.\n (CNN)The incredible pictures of a depleted  Lake Mead, on the California-Nevada border, illustrate the effects of drought brought on by climate change.\n Later this year, the US government will almost certainly declare the  first-ever water shortage along the Colorado River. Maps show more than a quarter of the US is in &#34; exceptional drought,&#34; underscoring the scope of a decades-long dry-out.\n Stories are popping up across the West of possible rationing, coming restrictions and looming standoffs between farmers and the government over the most precious natural resource.\n     The United States&#39; largest reservoir is draining rapidly. The shocking numbers behind  the Lake Mead drought crisis\n Restrictions. States like Arizona and Nevada are almost guaranteed to have their water allotment from the Colorado River cut back, which through a complicated drought contingency tier system  agreed to by states in 2019 will affect farmers first. But the warning signs are there for urban areas and surrounding states to conserve and evolve.\n   In the San Francisco Bay Area, served by a different water system,  residents are being asked to reduce water usage by 15% compared to 2019. Houseboats were removed from the state&#39;s second-largest reservoir because the water level fell so low. The hydropower plant at the same reservoir may be  forced offline for the first time because of low water.\n  Standoff. To the north, there&#39;s a sharp disagreement in Oregon between farmers cut off from water to irrigate their potatoes and federal officials trying to save an endangered species of fish.\n When CNN&#39;s Lucy Kafanov reported from the Klamath Basin last week, she did her live shot from the  parched bottom of a lake that should be feet deep.\n The farmers set up shop in a tent outside the canal headgate and were all but threatening to break in and open the gates themselves, like they did 20 years ago.\n The most visible and striking effect of the heat and drought is at Lake Mead, which is at its lowest levels since it was filled during construction of the Hoover Dam in the 1930s.\n Less snowpack and more evaporation from hot temperatures have taken their toll over the course of decades to the point where its dropped more than 140 feet since 2000 and sits at not much more than a third of its capacity.\n  The dam: Talk about an infrastructure project! President Joe Biden came to office promising a New Deal-level investment in infrastructure. That&#39;ll be pared back by three quarters if he&#39;s to get any Republican help passing it,\n Government spending: The latest bipartisan proposal includes $5 billion to help address the Western water shortage, although larger pots of money are meant to improve water and power infrastructure; the dam, with less water behind it, is producing less energy.\n Climate change: But while lawmakers are happy to find a way to spend money on infrastructure as long as they don&#39;t raise taxes, there&#39;s zero agreement with Republicans to do anything directly about climate change, which is helping this drought along. Democrats may try to go it alone and pass a much larger infrastructure bill that seeks to address climate change, but it&#39;s not clear they&#39;ll have the votes.\n Long time coming. The water at Lake Mead has been slowly falling for years. In 2015,  CNN went to see St. Thomas, a former town of 500 people that was bought out by the government and submerged under 60 feet of water for the sake of Lake Mead. St. Thomas emerged from the depths as the water lowered. And kept lowering.\n   Remember, 40 million people living across seven Western states and Mexico get their water from the Colorado River system.\n The entire West is dry. CNN&#39;s climate team put together  three maps to bring perspective to the historic drought.\n The current drought map shows the 88% of the Western part of the country in some shade of red and the East almost entirely unfazed.\n The upcoming rainfall outlook is just as grim, suggesting there will be no relief out West. And a look at stream and river flow demonstrates a lack of water moving across the region.\n They could have added a fourth with this heat map as the  West bakes in record temperatures.\n Decades of drought. The Intermountain West -- between the Rockies, the Cascades and the Sierra Nevada Mountains -- has technically been in a drought for decades, since 2000. It&#39;s a vicious cycle: Hot weather leads to drought, and drought leads to hot weather.\n   What makes a drought &#34;exceptional?&#34; It&#39;s interesting to look at what goes into these maps, which are quite alarming with all the deep red. The data is maintained by the  University of Nebraska-Lincoln in partnership with government agencies. They have very specific criteria that&#39;s unique to each state for delineating between &#34;extreme drought&#34; and &#34;exceptional drought.&#34;\n  Fields are left fallow; orchards are removed; vegetable yields are low; honey harvest is small\n   Fish rescue and relocation begins; pine beetle infestation occurs; forest mortality is high; wetlands dry up; survival of native plants and animals is low; fewer wildflowers bloom; wildlife death is widespread; algae blooms appear\n  Poor air quality affects health; greenhouse gas emissions increase as hydropower production decreases; West Nile Virus outbreaks rise\n Water shortages are widespread; surface water is depleted; federal irrigation water deliveries are extremely low; junior water rights are curtailed; water prices are extremely high; wells are dry, more and deeper wells are drilled; water quality is poor\n   We know the short-term effects of this drought will be restrictions and new rules. What&#39;s harder to see is the longer-term effects, although it&#39;s a broader look at water and drought that makes the dire predictions of  climate refugees fleeing parts of the country that become too hot or arid, or the breakdown of water sharing systems and agreements.\n That seems both a long way off as humans turn their attention toward using less water and finding new ways to capture it, store it and reuse it. But those far-fetched predictions seem all too close when the nation&#39;s largest reservoir is literally drying up.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 09:36:42", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,west,\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316", "title": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u897f\u90e8\u6b63\u5728\u5e72\u6db8\u3002 \u4e8b\u60c5\u4f1a\u53d8\u5f97\u4e11\u964b ", "title_en": "The American West is drying out.

would go. Over the next 5 months, I ended up releasing 16 libraries and learned a lot along the way. I wanted to share some of that knowledge and introduce some of the libraries you can now use in Ruby.\n  There are many great machine libraries for Python, so a natural place to start was to see what it\u2019d take to bring them to Ruby. It turned out to be a lot less work than expected based on a common theme.\n ML libraries want to be fast. This means less time waiting and more time iterating. However, interpreted languages like Python and Ruby aren\u2019t relatively fast. How do libraries overcome this?\n The key is they do most of the work in a compiled language - typically C++ - and have wrappers for other languages like Python.\n This was really great news. The same approach and code could be used for Ruby.\n   Native extensions are one method. They\u2019re written in C or C++ and use  Ruby\u2019s C API. You may have noticed gems with native extensions taking longer to install, as they need to compile.\n  A more general way for one language to call another is a foreign function interface, or FFI. It requires a C API (due to C++ name mangling), which many machine learning libraries had. An advantage of FFI is you can define the interface in the host language - in our case, Ruby.\n Ruby supports FFI with Fiddle. It was added in Ruby 1.9, but appears to be  \u201cthe Ruby standard library\u2019s best kept secret.\u201d\n  There\u2019s also the  FFI gem, which provides higher-level functionality and overcomes some limitations of Fiddle (like the ability to pass structs by value).\n  For libraries without a C API,  Rice provides a really nice way to bind C++ code (similar to Python\u2019s pybind11).\n  Another approach is SWIG (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator). You create an interface file and then run SWIG to generate the bindings. Gusto has a  good tutorial on this.\n  There\u2019s also  Rubex, which lets you write Ruby-like code that compiles to C (similar to Python\u2019s Cython). It also provides the ability to interface with C libraries.\n  None of the approaches above are specific to machine learning, so you can use them with any C or C++ library.\n  Libraries were chosen based on popularity and performance. Many have a similar interface to their Python counterpart to make it easy to follow existing tutorials. Libraries are broken down into categories below with brief descriptions.\n  XGBoost and  LightGBM are gradient boosting libraries. Gradient boosting is a powerful technique for building predictive models that fits many small decision trees that together make robust predictions, even with outliers and missing values. Gradient boosting performs well on tabular data.\n  Torch.rb and  TensorFlow are deep learning libraries. Torch.rb is built on LibTorch, the library that powers PyTorch. Deep learning has been very successful in areas like image recognition and natural language processing.\n  Disco is a recommendation library. It looks at ratings or actions from users to predict other items they might like, known as collaborative filtering. Matrix factorization is a common way to accomplish this.\n  Collaborative filtering can also find similar users and items. If you have a large number of users or items, an approximate nearest neighbor algorithm can speed up the search. Spotify  does this for music recommendations.\n NGT is an approximate nearest neighbor library that performs extremely well on benchmarks (in Python/C++).\n   Another promising technique for recommendations is factorization machines. The traditional approach to collaborative filtering builds a model exclusively from past ratings or actions. However, you may have additional  side information about users or items. Factorization machines can incorporate this data. They can also perform classification and regression.\n   Optimization finds the best solution to a problem out of many possible solutions. Scheduling and vehicle routing are two common tasks. Optimization problems have an objective function to minimize (or maximize) and a set of constraints.\n Linear programming is an approach you can use when the objective function and constraints are linear. Here\u2019s a really good  introductory series if you want to learn more.\n    fastText is a text classification and word representation library. It can label documents with one or more categories, which is useful for content tagging, spam filtering, and language detection. It can also compute word vectors, which can be compared to find similar words and analogies.\n   ONNX Runtime is a scoring engine for ML models. You can build a model in one language, save it in the ONNX format, and run it in another. Here\u2019s  an example.\n Npy is a library for saving and loading NumPy  npy and  npz files. It uses  Numo for multi-dimensional arrays.\n  Vowpal Wabbit specializes in online learning. It\u2019s great for reinforcement learning as well as supervised learning where you want to train a model incrementally instead of all at once. This is nice when you have a lot of data.\n  GSLR is a linear regression library powered by GSL that supports both ordinary least squares and ridge regression. It can be used alone or to improve the performance of  Eps.\n  I wanted to also give a shout-out to another library that entered the scene in 2019.\n Rumale is a machine learning library that supports many, many algorithms, similar to Python\u2019s Scikit-learn. Thanks  @yoshoku for the amazing work!\n  There are now many state-of-the-art machine learning libraries available for Ruby.

bodies to make vaccines that will\u00a0\u2013 hopefully\u00a0\u2013 prevent recurrences and treatments designed to fight off\u00a0advanced tumors.\n If they prove effective, which won&#39;t be known for at least another year or two, they could be added to the arsenal of immune therapies designed to get the body to fight off its own tumors.\n &#34;We feel pretty good about enrolling patients on these trials and are hopeful that ultimately they\u00a0can demonstrate improved outcomes,&#34; said Dr. Ryan Sullivan, a melanoma expert at\u00a0Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\n    Doctors are remaining cautious\u00a0because cancer vaccine\u00a0development &#34;has been littered with vaccines that haven&#39;t hit the mark,&#34; said Dr. Stephen Hahn, who had a career as an oncologist before running the Food and Drug Administration from 2019 until early this year.\n He said he&#39;s more optimistic this time because of how much researchers have learned about the role the immune system plays\u00a0in cancer.\n &#34;That gives us an edge to maybe finally get to the place where we need to be,&#34; said Hahn, who recently took a post with a venture capital firm, Flagship Pioneering. &#34;That would be just a remarkable step for all of us.&#34;\n  At the moment, most of the mRNA cancer vaccine trials are targeting\u00a0tumors such as melanoma and kidney cancer, where drugs called checkpoint inhibitors have already made a significant difference for many patients.\n &#34;My hope is that if we&#39;re successful, we&#39;ll be able to move into more tumor types where checkpoints haven&#39;t been as successful,&#34;\u00a0said Meredith McKean, Fentress&#39; oncologist at\u00a0Sarah Cannon Research Institute\u00a0in Nashville.\n  Fentress, of nearby Goodlettsville, Tennessee, thought he had a wart back in the summer of 2019 when he first noticed the odd bump on the middle finger of his left hand. He&#39;d had lots of those.\n At his wife Jennie&#39;s urging, he finally went to the dermatologist just before Thanksgiving. A few days later he got a call from the doctor. It wasn&#39;t just an ordinary wart, she told him, and he&#39;d need to come back to get a biopsy.\n  In early December, a surgeon amputated most of\u00a0his left middle finger. Fentress,\u00a0who is helping raise the two youngest of his five grandchildren, was told he had a 50% chance of recurrence. And if it did come back, his chances weren&#39;t good.\n  Over the last decade, pharmaceutical companies around the world have\u00a0been developing new ways to train the body&#39;s immune system to fight off tumors, particularly melanoma.\n  They had learned how to remove a brake installed by tumors, unleashing the warriors of the immune system. Ten years ago, only about 5% of people with advanced melanoma survived for five years. Now, nearly half\u00a0make it that long.\n  Trials of mRNA cancer vaccines, like the one\u00a0Fentress began in spring 2020, aim to boost that number even higher by adding soldiers to the fight.\n Cancer is challenging to treat because the body recognizes cancer cells as part of itself, and leaves them alone. Many of the targets of cancer therapy also are present in healthy cells, which is why cancer treatments are often so damaging.\n  Moderna, in a process similar to the other companies&#39;,\u00a0took cells from Fentress&#39; tumor. A computer analyzed the cells for tiny differences from normal cells that it could\u00a0use\u00a0as targets.\n Then the company\u00a0identified mutations that make protein variants only found on cancerous cells. They then create a single mRNA\u00a0that triggers the body to make these proteins\u00a0\u2013 just as COVID-19 vaccines trigger production of the spike protein that sits\u00a0on the surface of the virus. The presence of these protein fragments triggers the immune system to attack anything with that protein.\n  In April 2020, at Sarah Cannon, Fentress got his first shots of mRNA tailored to his tumor.\n &#34;They knocked me off my butt for about two days,&#34; he said. &#34;I&#39;ve never been as cold in my life.&#34;\n He also began\u00a0receiving a so-called checkpoint blockade drug to unleash his immune system against his cancer. The combination of lifting the brakes and adding soldiers to the fight\u00a0hopefully will keep his tumor from ever coming back.\n  It&#39;s too soon to know whether the therapy will work, but his doctor McKean, said he did well with the treatment.\n   Preventing recurrences is the &#34;ideal setting&#34; for mRNA technology,\u00a0said\u00a0Dr. \u00d6zlem T\u00fcreci, co-founder and chief medical officer of BioNTech.\n Once a tumor has been largely removed through surgery, a vaccine can help generate new immune soldiers known as T cells.\n &#34;The T cells will outnumber (cancer cells) and will be able to control them,&#34; T\u00fcreci said.\n Plus, a treatment soon after surgery may be able to prevent the tumor from outmaneuvering the body&#39;s immune defenses, she said.\n As with Fentress, surgical samples or a biopsy are sent to a lab where a patient&#39;s cancer cells are compared to healthy ones.\n A computer algorithm analyzes the mutations\u00a0distinct to the cancer cells, looking for ones that trigger the production of T cells, said Melissa J. Moore, Moderna&#39;s chief scientific officer, of platform research.\n So far, she said, Moderna, working with partner Merck,\u00a0has tested these personalized vaccines in about 100 patients.\n They aim eventually to make a personalized mRNA vaccine within about\u00a045\u00a0days after the patient&#39;s cancer surgery, during their\u00a0recovery.\n People who already have advanced cancer may not be able to wait for therapy. And while a few errant cancer cells are very diverse, once a tumor has spread throughout the body, it tends to develop consistent mutations, T\u00fcreci said.\n So the companies are also developing treatments that can be pre-made and &#39;taken off the shelf&#39; when a patient needs them.\n Mutated cancer cells have proteins on their surface that can be targeted by an mRNA vaccine.\u00a0For a tumor that has, say, five common mutations, a patient could get a combination of five of these vaccines.\n On Friday, BioNTech announced it was launching a new trial for this approach, testing it in 120 melanoma patients\u00a0Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia and the U.S. The new treatment, given in connection with an antibody from Regeneron, is aimed at four tumor-associated antigens. More than 90% of melanoma tumors contain at least one of the four.\n Researchers now have a better understanding of how to stimulate the immune system, said\u00a0Ulrike Gnad-Vogt, interim chief development officer for CureVac, a German mRNA\u00a0 company.\n   What still needs to be proven, experts say, is whether mRNA vaccines\u00a0can help win the battle against cancer, and if so, which approach will be better for which patients.\n The federal government  currently lists 29 studies\u00a0underway or will be soon investigating mRNA cancer vaccines.\n Because these therapies\u00a0are still experimental, there&#39;s no talk yet of how much they will cost. Patients don&#39;t pay to participate in clinical research trials.\n  To be worth any cost, mRNA vaccines will have to make a significant impact on survival, adding years not just weeks to someone&#39;s life, said Sullivan, at Mass. General.\u00a0He would consider them justified\u00a0if they could boost the long-term survival rate, which now hovers around 30%-40%, to 50%-80%.\n Dr. David Braun\u00a0a medical oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said it&#39;s always better to not make too may promises to cancer patients.\n &#34;As excited as I am about developments, I try to be cautious about overpromising,&#34; he said. &#34;Almost everyone knows someone who has not had effective therapy.&#34;\n But the fact that immune therapy has cured some cancer patients suggests there will be a way to spread those benefits to others, he said.\n In addition to treatment and prevention, mRNA can be used to turn the patient&#39;s body into a cancer drug-making machine.\n  Today, drugs like  Herceptin, which have been transformational in treating breast cancer, have to be produced in huge fermenters. These need to be kept clean and constantly scanned for imperfections, BioNTech&#39;s T\u00fcreci said.\n Instead, using mRNA technology, the patient&#39;s body could be triggered to produce the protein itself. &#34;It&#39;s an elegant and fast method, which does not need big production plants,&#34; she said.\n This research is in an early stage, T\u00fcreci noted, and details like\u00a0how often someone would need to be dosed have not yet been worked out.\n   It&#39;s made mRNA almost a household term around the world. It&#39;s proven the technology can work. And it&#39;s shown that mRNA can be made very quickly and at a tremendously large scale.\n Moderna produced its first doses of COVID-19 vaccine just two months after getting the genetic sequence of the virus \u2013 proving\u00a0that such\u00a0fast delivery is feasible, Moore said.\n Making a cancer vaccine is trickier.\u00a0With COVID, the virus&#39; genetic code led directly to a vaccine candidate, but with cancer, the tumor&#39;s genes have to be sequenced and the most potentially useful ones identified.\n  Experience with COVID-19 also helped boost production of mRNA to levels that would have seemed unbelievable just a decade ago, Moore said.\n &#34;I, in my wildest dreams\u00a0\u2026\u00a0would never have imagined that we&#39;d be making the quantities and quality of mRNA molecules we&#39;re making now with. If you had told me we were going to be doing this, I&#39;d have said you are completely crazy,&#34; she said, praising the engineers. &#34;Every time I think, &#39;Oh my God, we can&#39;t do any better than that,&#39; they surprise me.&#34;\n  It also showed how much easier it is to tackle an infectious disease like COVID-19 than cancer.\n &#34;What this taught me is gosh, it&#39;s really difficult to work in the cancer field,&#34; said T\u00fcreci, a long-time cancer researcher.\n With COVID-19, thousands of people were falling ill every day, yielding plenty of volunteers for clinical trials. It only took a few months to determine that BioNTech&#39;s vaccine provided strong protection. In cancer trials,\u00a0all five cancer centers in Germany might get only two eligible patients a month, she said. And it might be two to five years before researchers can be sure they are truly preventing someone&#39;s cancer from coming back.\n Cancer trials also were delayed during the worst of the COVID-19 outbreak\u00a0because patients couldn&#39;t make it in for treatments.\n Getting to this point was the product of decades of work by herself and others.\n &#34;There was so much to invest in terms of effort and innovation,&#34; T\u00fcreci said. &#34;Having had the opportunity\u00a0to show with the COVID vaccine that mRNA as such works is also very encouraging.&#34;\n   Fentress and his wife Jennie caught COVID-19 right after getting their first dose of vaccine.\n  They had to reschedule their second shots, but got them a few weeks later. &#34;I don&#39;t quite understand why people would refuse,&#34; said Fentress who described it as an insurance policy. &#34;I&#39;m a big fan of science and technology and stuff like that.&#34;\n  Now, he&#39;s happy he got cancer when he did. &#34;Any earlier or any later I wouldn&#39;t have gotten to participate&#34; in the clinical trial.\n  &#34;(They&#39;ve) given me a bunch of hope. They sure have,&#34; Fentress said.\u00a0&#34;If you don&#39;t have hope, you don&#39;t have any future.&#34;\n  Health and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.
