In programming, people talk about how the ability to Google is such an important skill. No one knows everything. In practice, people are always looking things up and running into weird situations that they have to figure out.</p><p>我是一名程序员。在编程中，人们谈论Google能力是多么重要的技能。没有人知道一切。在实践中，人们总是在寻找事物，并陷入必须解决的怪异情况。</p><p> That&#39;s not what this post is about. Not quite. This post is about the  decision to give it a google in the first place.</p><p> 那不是这篇文章的目的。不完全的。这篇文章是关于决定首先给它一个Google的决定。</p><p>  Here&#39;s an example. I play poker. It&#39;s hard to get good at poker, but not sucking at poker isn&#39;t very hard. Don&#39;t play junky hands preflop. Don&#39;t open-limp. Learn some basic poker math such as pot odds. If you can follow basic guidelines like that, you won&#39;t suck.</p><p>  这是一个例子。我玩扑克。很难擅长扑克，但是不吸吮扑克并不是很难。翻牌前不要玩垃圾手。不要张开嘴巴。学习一些基本的扑克数学，例如底池赔率。如果您能遵循这样的基本准则，就不会糟透了。</p><p> Yet if you sit down at a $1-2 game in Vegas, where hundreds of dollars are exchanging hands,  people who have been playing poker longer than I have been alive often don&#39;t understand these basic ideas. Ideas that you would learn if you spent ten minutes googling &#34;basics of poker strategy&#34;. You&#39;d come across articles like  How Not to Suck at Poker and you wouldn&#39;t be making such mistakes at the table.</p><p> 但是，如果您在拉斯维加斯举行的一场1-2美元的比赛中坐下来，那里有数百美元在交换手牌，那么玩扑克的时间比我还活着的人经常不了解这些基本概念。如果您花了十分钟的时间搜索“扑克策略基础”，就会学到一些想法。您会遇到诸如《如何不要在扑克上吮吸》之类的文章，并且您不会在桌上犯下这样的错误。</p><p> As an even more extreme example, I&#39;ve played in home games where despite playing poker for many years, people don&#39;t know even more basic things such as sizing your bets according to the size of the pot. Betting $20 into a $200 pot is a very small bet even if $20 feels like a lot of money. Your opponent only needs to put in $20 to have the chance at a $220 pot. Great risk-reward. In general, bet sizing is an incredibly complex topic, but all you have to know is to size your bet between 1/2 and the full size of the pot. The  80/20 principle really, really applies here.</p><p> 举一个更极端的例子，我玩过家庭游戏，尽管玩了很多年的扑克游戏，但人们甚至不知道更基本的事情，例如根据底池大小来确定赌注。即使$ 20感觉像很多钱，在$ 200的底池中下注$ 20还是很小的赌注。您的对手只需要投入20美元，便有机会获得220美元的底池。巨大的风险回报。通常，下注大小是一个非常复杂的话题，但是您所需要知道的只是将下注的大小限制在1/2到底池的全部大小之间。 80/20原则确实适用于此。</p><p>  Recently my girlfriend and I have been waking up with scratchy throats. Intuitively we thought it might be because it&#39;s getting colder out. Especially as we sleep. So we tried sleeping with the heat on higher.</p><p>  最近，我和我的女友一直嗓门沙哑。凭直觉，我们认为可能是因为天气变冷了。特别是当我们睡觉时。因此，我们尝试在高温下睡觉。</p><p> Turns out that was the exact wrong thing to do. I gave it a google and the issue seems to be that using the heat dries out the air, and dry air causes the sore throat symptoms we were experiencing.</p><p> 原来那是完全错误的事情。我给它一个谷歌，问题似乎是利用热量使空气干燥，而干燥的空气会导致我们所经历的喉咙痛症状。 </p><p>  I bought a humidifier last night. I could have just surfed around on Amazon a bit and picked something out. Instead, I gave it a google first.</p><p>昨晚我买了加湿器。我本可以在亚马逊上冲浪一下，然后挑选一些东西。相反，我首先给它一个谷歌。</p><p> It worked out well, I learned some really interesting things. A humidifier is something that seems simple where it doesn&#39;t really matter which one you choose. Turns out that intuition was also wrong.</p><p> 效果很好，我学到了一些非常有趣的东西。加湿器看起来很简单，选择哪一个都不重要。事实证明，直觉也是错误的。</p><p> It&#39;s something that you&#39;ll probably need to refill once a day, so you want it to be easy to refill. That means purchasing one that has a flat edge so you can sit it down on the counter while you refill it. My previous one was spherical so I couldn&#39;t sit it down like that. I had to hold it in one hand while I used the other hand to pour water into it. Such awkwardness adds up in the long run.</p><p> 您可能需要每天补充一次，所以您希望它很容易补充。这意味着要购买一个边缘平坦的容器，以便您在装满它时可以将其放在柜台上。我以前的那个是球形的，所以我不能那样坐下来。我必须一只手握住它，而另一只手则将水倒入其中。从长远来看，这种尴尬会加重。</p><p> Same story with ease of cleaning. With my previous one, the spout was small enough where I couldn&#39;t really reach inside to clean it and it had weird nooks and crannies that were hard/impossible to clean.</p><p> 同样的故事，易于清洁。在上一个喷头上，喷口很小，我根本无法伸手去清洗它，并且它的怪异角落和缝隙很难清洗。</p><p> One type of humidifier is called an evaporative humidifer. The main advantage is that it won&#39;t overhumidify your area. Once the humidity hits ~50% or so, it&#39;ll naturally stop producing as much humidity. The downside is that it is loud, has more moving parts, and requires you to purchase parts for it as a recurring expense.</p><p> 一种类型的加湿器称为蒸发式加湿器。主要优点是它不会使您的区域过度潮湿。一旦湿度达到50％左右，它自然就会停止产生尽可能多的湿度。不利的一面是它很大，有更多的活动部件，并且需要您为其购买零件以作为经常性费用。</p><p> After learning all of this stuff on The Wirecutter&#39;s  humidifier guide, I was able to pick the right humidifier for my needs instead of just finding the cheapest one on Amazon with decent reviews, which probably would have led to a good amount of future frustration.</p><p> 在The Wirecutter的加湿器指南中学习了所有这些内容之后，我能够选择适合自己需求的加湿器，而不仅仅是在亚马逊上找到价格最便宜的加湿器，并且获得了不错的评价，这可能会导致很多未来的挫败感。</p><p>  My girlfriend and I started playing tennis. We had played three times and made a little bit of progress, but still weren&#39;t very good.</p><p>  我和我的女友开始打网球。我们玩了三场比赛，并取得了一些进步，但仍然不是很好。 </p><p> Before our fourth time, I decided to give it a google. I came across this YouTube video:  Beginner Tennis Lesson | Forehand, Backhand &amp; Serve. It was great! It&#39;s amazing how some of those simple tips were so helpful. Without them we would have been doing much more floundering around.</p><p>在我们第四次之前，我决定给它一个谷歌。我看到了这个YouTube视频：初学者网球课|正手，反手＆amp;服务。太好了！这些简单提示中的一些如何如此有用，真是令人惊讶。没有他们，我们本来会挣扎得多。</p><p>   I find that there is a pretty high amount of variance in restaurant quality at a given price range. Most are pretty meh and leave me questioning whether it was worth spending my money there. But some are incredible and leave me very happy to have spent my money there! Especially the hole-in-the-wall type places. I really enjoy seeking those places out and channeling my inner Anthony Bourdain.</p><p>   我发现，在给定的价格范围内，餐厅的质量差异很大。大多数人都很漂亮，让我怀疑在这里花钱是否值得。但是有些太不可思议了，让我很高兴在这里花了我的钱！特别是壁挂式的地方。我非常喜欢寻找那些地方，并引导我内在的Anthony Bourdain。</p><p> Review sits such as Yelp and Google Reviews are far from perfect. Blogs and Eater are somewhat of an improvement, but also not perfect. Still, spending ten minutes skimming through such resources will definitely move the needle and seems like a great use of time.</p><p> Yelp和Google Reviews等评论网站远非完美。 Blog和Eater有所改进，但还不够完善。尽管如此，花十分钟浏览这些资源肯定会动起来，并且似乎在浪费大量时间。</p><p>  My dishwasher hasn&#39;t been working very well. I gave it a google and came across ol&#39;reliable Wirecutter&#39;s  position on the topic. I learned some very useful things that surprised me:</p><p>  我的洗碗机工作得不太好。我给它一个谷歌，发现了该主题上可靠的Wirecutter的立场。我学到了一些非常有用的东西，这些使我感到惊讶：</p><p> Cheap dishwashers still do a great job at cleaning. The thing that makes expensive ones better isn&#39;t that they do a better job at cleaning. This went directly against my initial impression that the old dishwasher in my not-renovated apartment was the problem.</p><p> 廉价洗碗机在清洁方面仍然做得很好。使昂贵的机器变得更好的是，它们在清洁方面做得更好。这直接与我最初的印象相反，即我未经装修的公寓中的旧洗碗机是问题所在。</p><p> If you pre-wash your dishes too much, it could cause problems. The water in your dishwasher that accumulates has crud and stuff from your dishes in it. The dishwasher measures this concentration. If it is low enough, it assumes your dishes must be clean and stops. This too went directly against what I previously thought. I had been trying to do more and more pre-washing to fix the issue.</p><p> 如果您洗碗的次数过多，可能会引起问题。洗碗机中积聚的水已将餐具中的残渣和东西塞入其中。洗碗机测量该浓度。如果足够低，则认为您的餐具必须干净并停下来。这也直接违背了我以前的想法。我一直在尝试进行越来越多的预洗以解决该问题。</p><p> Dishwashers need to be cleaned! With all of that hot water and soap in there, who would have thought!</p><p> 洗碗机需要清洗！那里有所有的热水和肥皂，谁会想到的！ </p><p> As a bonus, it&#39;s significantly more energy efficient to use a dishwasher than to hand wash. I previously always tried to hand wash stuff and fill up the dishwasher pretty full so I don&#39;t have to run as many loads.</p><p>另外，使用洗碗机比手洗更节能。以前，我一直尝试用手洗东西，然后将洗碗机注满，这样我就不必再负担那么多的负载了。</p><p>  I made black bean burgers last night. Before doing so I hit up my trusty resource: Serious Eats. They have a  great article on black bean burgers that really improved the quality of my cooking. Here are the important things I learned:</p><p>  昨晚我做了黑豆汉堡。在此之前，我先阅读我可信赖的资源：认真饮食。他们在黑豆汉堡上有一篇很棒的文章，确实改善了我的烹饪质量。这是我学到的重要知识：</p><p> Some cooked grain or nut like cashews give it a nice textural variation on the inside like you&#39;d find in a normal beef burger.</p><p> 像腰果这样的煮熟的谷物或坚果可以使它的内部具有很好的质感变化，就像在普通的牛肉汉堡中发现的那样。</p><p> It&#39;s also nice to get some pockets of fat on the inside of the burger, and cheese works great for this. But you need a firmer, fresher cheese like feta. A gooey would just melt and be more uniform.</p><p> 在汉堡内部放一些脂肪也是很好的选择，奶酪对此非常有用。但是您需要像羊乳酪这样的更坚硬，更新鲜的奶酪。黏糊糊只会融化并变得更均匀。</p><p> Unlike beef burgers, you have to use moderate heat. Otherwise the outside will burn and the inside won&#39;t cook all the way through.</p><p> 与牛肉汉堡不同，您必须使用适度的热量。否则，外部会燃烧并且内部不会完全煮熟。</p><p> I&#39;m not sure how much this example really meshes with my main point of &#34;give it a google&#34;. If I just &#34;gave it a google&#34;, I&#39;d probably come across some more standard recipe that wouldn&#39;t mention these things. I also cross-referenced with Budget Bytes and sure enough they didn&#39;t mention these things. Here this only worked because I was previously familiar with Serious Eats and knew to look there. So it&#39;d probably be more accurate to say &#34;give reliable resources you know a quick check&#34; than &#34;give it a google&#34;.</p><p> 我不确定这个示例与我的主要观点“ Google”相吻合的程度。如果我只是给它一个Google，我可能会遇到一些更标准的配方，而这些配方都不会提及。我还与“预算字节”进行了交叉引用，并确定它们没有提及这些内容。在这里这样做仅是因为我以前很熟悉“严重饮食”，并且知道去那里看。因此，说出您知道快速检查的可靠资源可能更准确。而不是给它一个Google＆＃34;。</p><p>  Another example of &#34;give reliable resources you know a quick check&#34; is with the  microCOVID Project. They&#39;ll tell you roughly how much risk eg. going shopping is compared to an outdoor hangout with friends.</p><p>  提供可靠资源的另一个示例，您知道可以快速检查＆＃34;与microCOVID项目有关。他们会大致告诉您例如多少风险。将逛街与与朋友的户外聚会进行了比较。 </p><p> My girlfriend had some family business to take care of at her parents yesterday, but it would involve being indoors with them for a few hours during the peak of the pandemic. So we consulted the site, determined that it would  cost about 400 microCOVIDs, and decided that it would be an acceptable risk.</p><p>我的女友昨天有一些家族企业要照顾她的父母，但要在大流行高峰期陪伴他们在室内呆几个小时。因此，我们咨询了该站点，确定将花费约400 microCOVID，并确定这是可以接受的风险。</p><p>  I recently discovered the  River Mountains Loop bike trail. It looks so cool! I want to give it a try!</p><p>  我最近发现了River Mountains Loop自行车道。看起来好酷！我想试试看！</p><p> I was looking around on that TrailLink website and saw that there are &#34;big horn sheep&#34; along the trail.</p><p> 我在该TrailLink网站上四处张望，发现那里有＆＃34;大角羊＆＃34;沿着小径。</p><p>     Well, are those safe? Turns out the answer is that you shouldn&#39;t get close to them or carry food around them, but they&#39;re not nearly a big enough danger to get in the way of a bike ride.</p><p>     好吧，那些安全吗？原来的答案是，您不应该靠近它们或在它们周围携带食物，但是它们几乎没有足够大的危险来妨碍骑自行车。</p><p> Good news. But what about other dangers? I spent a little bit of time (ok fine, a full two day  rabbit hole) skimming around  The Great Outdoors Stack Exchange and it seems perfectly safe if you&#39;re not stupid.</p><p> 好消息。但是其他危险呢？我花了一点时间（很好，一个整整两天的兔子洞）在The Great Outdoors Stack Exchange上浏览了一下，如果您不傻的话，这似乎是绝对安全的。</p><p> Ok. But what about hills? I&#39;ve done ~25 mile rides before and felt ok afterwards so you&#39;d think 36 would be alright, especially if I take a rest. But maybe this route is a lot more hilly and I wouldn&#39;t be able to finish the ride. I googled it, ended up on YouTube and watched a few videos, discovered that there are in fact some significant hills and that I&#39;d try doing part of the route first before attempting the whole route.</p><p> 好。但是小山呢？我之前骑过约25英里，之后感觉还不错，所以您会认为36没事，尤其是如果我休息一下。但是，也许这条路线更加崎and，我无法完成旅程。我在Google上搜索了一下，最后在YouTube上观看了一些视频，发现实际上有一些重要的山丘，在尝试整条路线之前，我会先尝试完成部分路线。</p><p>  I&#39;m planning on buying a house. One of the things I&#39;m looking for is the ability to Airbnb the house and spend time traveling. Particularly if I buy the house in Vegas where the summers are crazy hot and I&#39;d like to get away. How easy is this to do? How big is the risk that it just fails and doesn&#39;t generate any revenue?</p><p>  我正在计划买房。我要寻找的东西之一是能够对房屋进行Airbnb消费并花时间旅行。特别是如果我在拉斯维加斯买房子的时候，那里夏天非常热，我想逃走。这有多容易做到？它只会失败而不会产生任何收入的风险有多大？ </p><p> I spent some time googling around for answers to these questions. And this time, I didn&#39;t find them!</p><p>我花了一些时间在谷歌周围寻找这些问题的答案。而这次，我没有找到它们！</p><p> I think that this is a key point. It&#39;s ok that I didn&#39;t find the answers.</p><p> 我认为这是关键。我没找到答案，这是可以的。</p><p> I&#39;ve listed nine examples in this article. This one is the tenth, so I&#39;m batting 0.900. I think that&#39;s probably in the ballpark of my true success rate with &#34;give it a google&#34;. Given these odds, &#34;give it a google&#34; is still highly worthwhile, even though you risk leaving empty handed at times. You gotta risk it to get the biscuit!</p><p> 我在本文中列出了九个示例。这是第十个，所以我的击球率为0.900。我认为，如果给我一个Google，那可能是我真正的成功率的起点。考虑到这些可能性，请给它一个Google＆＃34;即使您冒着空手的风险，仍然值得。您必须冒险拿饼干！</p><p>  Perhaps you can tell, I&#39;m a little bit passionate about this &#34;give it a google&#34; idea. The return on investment is just so huge. A few minutes can teach you so much and help you avoid so many headaches.</p><p>  也许您可以告诉我，对此我有点热情＆＃34;给它一个Google＆＃34;理念。投资回报是如此巨大。几分钟可以教给您很多知识，并可以帮助您避免很多头痛。</p><p> I remember the first time I learned about Google. I was at my grandparents house. My grandpa has always been a curious person who likes to learn. Whenever I go there he likes to sit down and teach me things, which I thoroughly enjoy.</p><p> 我记得我第一次了解Google。我当时在我的祖父母家。我的祖父一直是一个好奇的人，喜欢学习。每当我去那里，他都喜欢坐下来教我一些东西，这些东西我都非常喜欢。</p><p> Normally he has a mild excitement to him when he explains things to me. This time though, there was a noticeably higher amount of excitement to him.</p><p> 通常，当他向我解释事情时，他会感到很激动。不过这次，他的兴奋程度明显更高。</p><p> He taught me about this web search thing he read about in the newspaper. You don&#39;t have to know the website you want in advance. If you know the  question you want answered, you can enter it in and Google will show you the websites you should visit to find the answer!</p><p> 他教了我报纸上读到的有关此网络搜索的知识。您不必事先了解您想要的网站。如果您知道要回答的问题，可以将其输入，然后Google会向您显示您应该访问的网站以找到答案！ </p><p>  Try taking a time machine back a few dozen years, find someone at the library searching for something, and tell them you have a machine that will show them exactly where to search. Avoids a lot of frustration, right?</p><p>尝试将时光机取回几十年，在图书馆找人搜索，然后告诉他们您有一台可以向他们确切显示搜索位置的机器。避免很多挫败感，对吧？</p><p> Now try telling them that  the entire library fits inside of this little machine. And that the machine fits inside their  pocket! Madness! But this is  the reality that we live in.</p><p> 现在尝试告诉他们整个库都适合这台小型计算机。而且机器可以放进他们的口袋里！疯狂！但这是我们生活的现实。</p><p> I don&#39;t think we take enough advantage of it though. Given how quick and convenient it is to research certain topics, I think &#34;give it a google&#34; is a major low hanging fruit that society should spend a lot more time plucking.</p><p> 我认为我们虽然没有充分利用它。考虑到研究某些主题的速度和便捷性，我认为可以给它一个Google＆＃34;是社会应该花费更多时间采摘的重要成果。</p><p>  Note that even in the failure case (success rate of AirBNB hosts in Las Vegas), you still learned something - that it&#39;s not a simple enough question for easy answers.</p><p>  请注意，即使在失败的情况下（拉斯维加斯的AirBNB主机成功率），您仍然学到了一些东西-这不是一个简单的问题，无法轻松获得答案。</p><p> SEO has gotten to the point that it actually takes some skill to google things usefully.  This is the only reason I can think that your main point (you&#39;ll learn something valuable in a very short time on almost any topic, so use this technique early and often) would not apply to most of us.</p><p> SEO到了要点，实际上需要一些技巧来对Google事物进行有用的搜索。这是我可以认为您的主要观点（您将在很短的时间内在几乎所有主题上学到一些有价值的东西，因此请尽早并经常使用此技术）不适用于我们大多数人的唯一原因。</p><p> Note that even in the failure case (success rate of AirBNB hosts in Las Vegas), you still learned something - that it&#39;s not a simple enough question for easy answers.</p><p> 请注意，即使在失败的情况下（拉斯维加斯的AirBNB主机成功率），您仍然学到了一些知识-这不是一个简单的问题，无法轻松获得答案。</p><p>  SEO has gotten to the point that it actually takes some skill to google things usefully.

Makes me think back to  The Distribution of Users’ Computer Skills: Worse Than You Think.</p><p>是的，这听起来似乎很合理，但这并不是我想到的。让我回想起《用户计算机技能的分布：比您想象的还要糟糕》。</p><p> SEO has gotten to the point that it actually takes some skill to google things usefully.</p><p> SEO到了要点，实际上需要一些技巧来对Google事物进行有用的搜索。</p><p> Interesting. I thought it was because Google progressively dumbed down their search and optimized it for finding things that  most people wanted to find, but not what  I wanted to find. But I suppose there&#39;s no reason it can&#39;t be both causes.</p><p> 有趣。我以为是因为Google逐渐简化了搜索，并对其进行了优化，以查找大多数人想找到的东西，而不是我想找到的东西。但是我认为没有理由不能同时造成这两种原因。</p><p> It&#39;s also plausible to me that it requires enough intersections (owns a house; rents the house out on AirBnB; in a single metro area; measures success in a reasonable way; writes about it on the internet) gets small enough that there are no results.</p><p> 对我来说，它也需要足够的交叉路口（拥有房屋；在AirBnB上出租房屋；在一个大都市地区；以合理的方式衡量成功；在互联网上写下有关内容）变得足够小，以至于我认为这很合理。没有结果。</p><p> Looking for general advice (how to succeed as an AirBNB host) might give a model that&#39;s easy to fill in, like &#34;you will succeed if the location is X appealing and there are f(X) listings or fewer.&#34;</p><p> 寻找一般建议（如何成功成为AirBNB托管人）可能会提供一种易于填写的模型，例如，如果位置吸引X并且有f（X）个列表，或者更少。＆＃34;</p><p> That still seems like a pretty easy answer to me, but it could only be found with slightly better Google Fu.</p><p> 对于我来说，这似乎仍然是一个很简单的答案，但只有使用更好的Google Fu才能找到。</p><p> I think that leads to a need for heuristics on how hard to try rephrasing things or when to give up quickly rather than getting sucked down a two day wiki walk rabbit hole.</p><p> 我认为这导致需要试探法来尝试改写事物的难易程度或何时快速放弃，而不是被吸引了两天的Wiki Walk兔子洞。 </p><p> It&#39;s worth noting that Google isn&#39;t the only search engine around. There are times when Google seems to have editoral decisions to show certain results and Yandex as an independent search engine gives you better results.</p><p>值得注意的是Google并不是唯一的搜索引擎。有时候Google似乎会根据编辑决定显示某些结果，而Yandex作为独立的搜索引擎可以为您提供更好的结果。</p><p> SEO has gotten to the point that it actually takes some skill to google things usefully.</p><p> SEO到了要点，实际上需要一些技巧来对Google事物进行有用的搜索。</p><p> So true and breaks my heart. I can feel the increased Googling difficulty, in my bones, over the last 18 months or so.  Tragedy of the commons strikes again.</p><p> 如此真实，伤透了我的心。在过去的18个月左右的时间里，我的骨头上出现了谷歌搜索难度越来越大的感觉。公地的悲剧再次袭来。</p><p> When the Internet was young, I would go straight to cnet.com for device reviews. When Google got good, I would go to Google.  Now, I go straight to cnet.com for device reviews.</p><p> 互联网还很年轻的时候，我会直接去cnet.com进行设备评论。当Google变得不错时，我会去Google。现在，我直接进入cnet.com进行设备评论。</p><p> Interesting to hear. I&#39;ve always had a vague sense that search results aren&#39;t that great in general but haven&#39;t noticed a change over time. Could easily just be me though.</p><p> 有趣的消息。我一直有一种模糊的感觉，即搜索结果总体上并没有那么好，但是还没有注意到随着时间的变化。可能很容易就是我。</p><p> It could be me, too. I used to have to think about SEO when I was in charge of a previous employer&#39;s minimal online marketing/blogging, so plenty of this sensation could be confirmation bias (tendency to blame bad Google results on SEO rather than Google, whose product it is). But I think I can spot a page that was generated primarily through SEO--probably with a better accuracy rate than me differentiating between GPT-3 and Wittgenstein.</p><p> 也可能是我。当我负责以前的雇主的最低限度的在线营销/博客工作时，我曾经不得不考虑SEO，因此很多这种感觉可能是确认偏差（倾向于将Google的不良搜索结果归咎于SEO，而不是Google产品）。但是我认为我可以发现主要是通过SEO生成的页面-可能比区分GPT-3和维特根斯坦的准确率更高。</p><p> Hello to all my housemates reading this, 30% of the time when you ask me a question this is the answer :P</p><p> 您好，我所有的室友都读过这篇文章，当您问我一个问题时，有30％的时间是答案：P </p><p> I&#39;m frequently surprised that my parents will spend effort on something or ask another person for help  without Googling; both are well-educated and comfortable using the internet, but it just isn&#39;t their first instinct like it is with me.

Since people around you are in the same environment as you, you can usually get a lot more specific advice.</p><p> 我与父母和一些同事也有类似的经历。人们经常会问我如何做一些与工作相关的事情，而通常可以通过快速的google解决。当我与我的伴侣讨论这个问题时，她说她可能会想到一些原因，为什么最好先问问周围的人。 1.由于您周围的人与您处于同一环境中，因此您通常可以获得更多具体建议。</p><p> 2. It&#39;s possible that they are asking you questions because they enjoy interacting with you and want to use it as an opportunity to learn something and interact with you at the same time.</p><p> 2.他们之所以问您问题，是因为他们喜欢与您互动，并希望以此为契机同时学习一些东西并与您互动。</p><p> Another datapoint: After googling &#34;How to stop biting my nails&#34;,  reading a few of the results and trying out  one of the instructions, I stopped biting my nails.</p><p> 另一个数据点：谷歌搜索“如何停止咬指甲”，阅读了一些结果并尝试了其中的一项说明后，我不再咬指甲。</p><p> Have a theory about why people can be reluctant to google. It may be excessively bitter.  To a large extent (especially for neurotypical people, though it seems to depend on the subject) learning is an unconscious process. The result is that people don&#39;t know how they learned and don&#39;t know how to teach.   What&#39;s more, people are apt to want to just get things done and also apt to have punishment as an easy strategy. So they shame people for not knowing what they are supposed to have picked up somehow.  This means that googling indicates that you didn&#39;t know something already, so googling means getting past an emotional barrier.  That&#39;s certainly not the only thing that&#39;s going on. I think asking questions as socializing is a thing, and so is not realizing the amazing scope of what can be searched for. And for some of us, just being old enough that the habit of googling didn&#39;t get developed.   I&#39;m a frequent and pretty habitual googler, and I&#39;ve mostly stopped calling it &#34;living in the future&#34;.</p><p> 有一个关于人们为何不愿使用Google的理论。它可能会非常苦。在很大程度上（特别是对于神经性典型的人，尽管这似乎取决于受试者）学习是一个无意识的过程。结果是人们不知道如何学习，也不知道如何教。更重要的是，人们倾向于只是把事情做好，也倾向于将惩罚作为一种简单的策略。因此，他们因不知道应该以某种方式获得的东西而使人们感到羞耻。这意味着谷歌搜索表明您不知道某些内容，因此谷歌搜索意味着越过情感障碍。当然，这并不是唯一的事情。我认为问问题是社交活动是一回事，而没有意识到可以找到的惊人范围。对于我们中的一些人来说，年龄已经足够大，以至于养成谷歌搜索的习惯就没有养成。我是一个频繁且非常习惯的Googler，并且我几乎不再称它为“未来生活”。</p><p> 1) This strikes me as an honest attempt at world modeling. 2) I don&#39;t share the viewpoint but I think it meets the bar of being plausibly true. 3) Given the intended content, I don&#39;t think it was written in an excessively bitter tone at all.</p><p> 1）这让我印象深刻，这是对世界建模的诚实尝试。 2）我不同意这个观点，但我认为它符合看起来真实的标准。 3）鉴于预期的内容，我认为它根本不是用过分苦涩的语气写的。</p><p> Using the criteria of &#34;I want to see more/less of this&#34; that the  FAQ recommends for voting, I want to see more comments like this. I worry that currently, people are fearful about coming across as too bitter and it gets in the way of honest attempts at world modeling.</p><p> 使用“我想查看更多/更少”的标准FAQ建议您投票，我想看到更多类似的评论。我担心，当前人们担心会遇到如此痛苦的情况，这会妨碍进行世界建模的诚实尝试。 </p><p> Related to dishwashers, something I learned about recently is that having detergrent in the pre-wash step makes a big difference, but a lot of people don&#39;t know this because of the detergent packs (which don&#39;t fit in the prewash compartment). My dishwasher doesn&#39;t even have a prewash compartment, but it does work better if I throw another tablet in the bottom of the tub (although it would be more efficient to get powdered detergent).</p><p>与洗碗机有关，我最近了解到的一点是，在预洗步骤中具有洗涤剂的作用会产生很大的不同，但是很多人不知道这一点，因为洗涤剂包装（不适合放入洗衣机中）预洗室）。我的洗碗机甚至没有预洗间，但如果我在浴缸底部放另一片药片，它的工作效果会更好（尽管获得洗衣粉更有效）。</p><p> An addendum to this, perhaps as a next level, is to give it a non-google search.</p><p> 对此的一个补充，也许是下一阶段，是对其进行非Google搜索。</p><p> DuckDuckGo helps me avoid the SEO-driven spammy results more easily than with Google, which is particularly apparent when searching about products, or terms that could be construed as product-related. My hypothesis is that the SEOptimizers have learnt the specifics of what Google&#39;s algorithm looks for and so have refined techniques to get their less-deserving clients rise to the top, and (thankfully) those techniques don&#39;t work with whatever alternate algorithms DDG uses. (To be clear, it&#39;s not a strict &#34;DDG is always better than Google&#34; thing, rather that they&#39;re surprisingly good at complementing each other, one being good when the other gives weak results.)</p><p> 与Google相比，DuckDuckGo帮助我更轻松地避免了SEO驱动的垃圾邮件结果，这在搜索产品或可能被视为与产品相关的字词时尤其明显。我的假设是SEOptimizers已经了解了Google算法所寻找的细节，因此也采用了完善的技术来使他们不该获得的客户排在首位，并且（幸运的是）这些技术不能与之配合使用。 DDG使用的替代算法。 （要清楚，并不是严格的DDG总是比Google更好，而是它们令人惊讶地擅长于互补，一个在另一个弱点时就很好。结果。）</p><p> Million short is useful when I&#39;m searching for something that&#39;s had a lot of media attention, but I want to avoid the mainstream media pieces on it. It excludes the top 100/1000/.../million websites on the Internet (as ranked by Alexa) from its results, which is sometimes exactly what you want.</p><p> 当我要搜索引起媒体广泛关注的内容时，短短百万字很有用，但我想避免使用主流媒体。它从结果中排除Internet上排名靠前的100/1000 /.../百万个网站（由Alexa排名），有时这正是您想要的。</p><p> For the sake of completion, some other alternate search engines are  Metager ,  Qwant , and  Mojeek (all of which claim privacy as their primary benefit). And I love me a bit of  wiby when I&#39;m feeling nostalgic about the old, simpler, 90s Internet of plain personal pages, and want to experience some of that again.</p><p> 为了完善起见，其他一些替代搜索引擎是Metager，Qwant和Mojeek（它们都声称隐私是他们的主要利益）。当我对旧的，更简单的90年代普通个人页面Internet怀有怀旧之情并想再次体验其中的一些时，我爱上了我。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/d6yNW5T6J9rtnGizc/give-it-a-google">https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/d6yNW5T6J9rtnGizc/give-it-a-google</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/give/">#give</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
