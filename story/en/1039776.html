No matter that it would be several more days before Hsieh died — the several dozen technologists, artists and other creatives on his payroll clearly understood that the party was over. According to a neighbor, they appeared to disappear overnight.</p><p>  谢家祥（Tony Hsieh）在康涅狄格州因感恩节前的大火而丧生时濒临死亡，U-Haul卡车和拖车开始抵达犹他州帕克城（Park City），度假城市扎波斯（Zappos）背后的有远见者迅速建立了享乐主义的飞地。无论谢谢死多几天，他工资单上的数十名技术人员，艺术家和其他创意人士都清楚地知道党已经结束了。一位邻居说，它们似乎在一夜之间消失了。</p><p>  Contrast that with the scene in downtown Las Vegas, which Hsieh had spent the previous decade trying to almost single-handedly revitalize. Notes and flowers still pile up in front of the Zappos headquarters, while his image, hundreds of feet wide, is being projected across the mammoth LED screens of the Fremont Street Experience. “There’s a sadness here,” Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman tells  Forbes.</p><p>  与谢建华在过去十年中一直试图单枪匹马振兴的拉斯维加斯市中心形成鲜明对比。 Zappos总部前仍然堆满了笔记和鲜花，而他的影像（数百英尺宽）正投射在Fremont Street Experience的巨型LED屏幕上。拉斯维加斯市长卡罗琳·古德曼（Carolyn Goodman）告诉《福布斯》：“这里令人难过。”</p><p> There’s also a quiet fury, aimed directly at members of this so-called “Park City Crew,” many of whom are slowly filtering back to Las Vegas. “I think whoever was there, they saw him hurting himself, they should have done the right thing,” says Michael Cornthwaite, a friend of Hsieh’s for more than a decade. Another longtime friend describes a two-part anger among his circle, “because, one, they lost Tony, and they felt Tony didn’t have anyone who loved him around him, all he had was people who financially benefited from him.”</p><p> 还有一个安静的愤怒，直接针对这个所谓的“ Park City Crew”的成员，其中许多人正慢慢回到拉斯维加斯。 “我认为无论在哪里的人，都看到他在伤害自己，应该做正确的事，”谢家的朋友迈克尔·康思韦特说，已经有十多年了。另一个长期的朋友在他的圈子中描述了两部分的愤怒，“因为，一个人失去了托尼，他们觉得托尼周围没有任何人爱他，他所拥有的只是那些从他身上受益的人。”</p><p> After  documenting Hsieh’s life, the impact he had on Vegas and his downward spiral this year,  Forbes spoke with more people who were living with Hsieh in Utah over his final months, and several other older friends familiar with what happened. They show how this group of people who joined Hsieh in Park City indulged in his worst behaviors while on his payroll, as his mental and physical health deteriorated. In the words of one old friend: “This is about manipulative leeches who exploited someone’s weakness for their own gain in the darkest of all possible ways.&#34;</p><p> 在记录了谢先生的生活，他对维加斯的影响以及今年以来的下滑之后，福布斯与他在最后几个月与谢先生一起生活在犹他州的更多人以及其他几位熟悉发生了什么的老朋友进行了交谈。他们展示了加入谢赫在帕克城的一群人是如何在他的薪水上沉迷于他最坏的行为的，因为他的身心健康状况恶化了。用一位老朋友的话说：“这是操纵性的水ches，他们以最黑暗的方式利用某人的弱点谋取自己的利益。＆＃34;</p><p>   While longtime friends of Hsieh’s first noticed him becoming more withdrawn, even distant, during conversations in the last months of 2019, Hsieh’s descent coincided almost exactly with his relocation to Park City. In January, he attended the Sundance Film Festival there, as rumors swirled around Las Vegas that Hsieh had been partying hard with a new group of younger friends.</p><p>   谢谢的长期朋友第一次注意到他在2019年最后几个月的谈话中变得更加孤僻，甚至遥远，谢谢的血统几乎恰好与他搬迁至帕克城的时间相吻合。 1月，他参加了在那里的圣丹斯电影节，当时有谣传在拉斯维加斯传开，谢谢一直在与一群年轻的朋友们开派对。</p><p> A few days later, Hsieh returned briefly to Las Vegas to officiate the wedding of two local small business owners. He seemed different. Photos taken at the event, held at a venue across the street from the El Cortez Casino, and shared with  Forbes, show Hsieh wearing a bright orange sweater and brandishing a long stick covered in post-it notes. As he walked the couple through their vows, Hsieh seemed inebriated, according to onlookers, chain-smoking Camel cigarettes through the ceremony. During the seated reception, as friends and family toasted the newlyweds with speeches, Hsieh and a group of people did yoga on mats nearby. “A lot of people were concerned,” says one person who attended the wedding.</p><p> 几天后，谢女士短暂回到拉斯维加斯，主持了两个当地小企业主的婚礼。他似乎与众不同。在活动中拍摄的照片在谢尔盖·科特斯赌场（El Cortez Casino）街对面的一个地点举行，并与《福布斯》（Forbes）分享，显示谢谢穿着一件鲜艳的橙色毛衣，挥舞着长条，上面贴着便条纸。据围观者说，当他带领这对新人走过他们的誓言时，谢似乎似乎很生气，在仪式上抽着骆驼烟。在就座酒会上，当亲朋好友用演讲向新婚夫妇敬酒时，谢和一群人在附近的垫子上做瑜伽。参加婚礼的一位人士说：“很多人都很担心。” </p><p>  Realizing the growing buzz around his behavior, Hsieh relocated to his new home, Park City. He told people he intended to focus on health, wellness and rehabilitation. Visitors cite aspects of wellness built in to his Park City schedule — from yoga to meditation to horseback riding, some of which was organized by Wellth Collective, a company cofounded by Hsieh confidante Suzie Baleson. (Baleson did not respond to requests for comment). A friend who joined Hsieh in Park City in late February, when he was renting a house at the time, said he had never seen the tech entrepreneur in better shape.</p><p>Hsieh意识到自己的行为越来越热闹，就搬到了他的新家Park City。他告诉人们，他打算专注于健康，保健和康复。参观者引用了帕克市日程中内置的健康方面，从瑜伽到冥想再到骑马，其中一些由谢茜红颜小伙伴苏西·巴列森（Suzie Baleson）共同创立的公司Wellth Collective组织。 （Baleson未回复置评请求）。一位朋友于2月下旬加入谢贤，当时是他在帕克城租房的时候，他说，他从未见过这位技术企业家。</p><p> But Hsieh’s retreat soon descended into something more sinister as the Park City Crew joined him in the mountain city over the following months. As  Forbes previously reported, Hsieh made many of them a ‘double-your-best-salary’ offer to join him in Park City on the condition they ‘be happy’ — a proposition many quickly accepted.</p><p> 但是谢贤的撤退很快就变得更加险恶，因为在接下来的几个月里，帕克城的船员加入了他，来到了这座山城。正如《福布斯》先前报道的那样，谢家华为他们中的许多人提供了“双倍薪水”的要约，条件是他们“很幸福”并加入帕克城。这一提议很快就被人们接受。</p><p>  To house his growing community, Hsieh gradually purchased nine properties, at a cost running into eight digits, amounting to about 15% of the ritzy, lakeside Aspen Springs neighborhood, riling the former corporate executives and bankers who lived there. As the year wore on, the number of hangers-on rose into the dozens as people came to make cash and stay for free, while purporting to help realize Hsieh’s many visions.</p><p>  为了容纳他不断发展的社区，谢先生逐渐购买了九处房产，价格达到八位数，约占这座古老的湖畔阿斯彭斯普林斯社区的15％，这激怒了居住在那里的前企业高管和银行家。随着岁月的流逝，随着人们开始赚钱并免费居住，衣架的数量增加到了几十个，同时旨在帮助实现谢先生的许多愿景。</p><p> Hsieh espoused grand plans, from creating world peace to building another Burning Man in Utah. He also went out of his way to support local businesses in Park City amid the pandemic, buying out entire restaurant patios for his group. Hsieh spent big money on Covid rapid tests to keep the party going.</p><p> 谢建华拥护宏伟的计划，从创造世界和平到在犹他州建立另一个燃烧的人。在大流行期间，他还竭尽全力为帕克城的当地企业提供支持，为团队购买了整个餐厅露台。 Hsieh在Covid快速测试上花了大笔钱，以保持聚会的进行。</p><p> These “employees” tried to justify their gigs by answering to Hsieh’s every whim. One resident recalls a wall of post-its, on which Hsieh would post “bounties” — or tasks that Hsieh would then pay $100 or more for someone to complete. Some were in line with building a fun park, such as an effort to construct an ice bar at one of the properties.</p><p> 这些“员工”试图通过回应谢震的每一个心血来证明自己的演出是合理的。一位居民回想起一堵墙，谢谢将在上面贴上“赏金”，或者谢谢要为某人完成支付100美元或更多的任务。有些人计划建造一个有趣的公园，例如努力在其中一处建造冰吧。</p><p>  But other projects were more untoward. One post-it asked for a research report on nitrous oxide, which Hsieh seemed to be consuming almost continuously at times — one witness even says Hsieh was holding a canister while lunching with Park City’s mayor, Andy Beerman. (The mayor declined to comment on the meeting, adding that Hsieh resided in the resort city for only a short period.) At one point, Hsieh told a resident that he had directed some of his acolytes to create a documentary on the laughing gas.</p><p>  但是其他项目则比较不理想。一位便利贴要求提供一份有关一氧化二氮的研究报告，谢谢有时似乎几乎连续消耗一氧化二氮。一位目击者甚至说谢谢在与帕克市市长安迪·比尔曼（Andy Beerman）午餐时拿着一个罐子。 （市长拒绝在会议上发表评论，并补充说谢谢只是在度假城市居住了很短的时间。）谢谢告诉一位居民，他指示他的助手们制作了一部关于笑气的纪录片。</p><p> Increasingly, many who took Hsieh up on his offer to move to Utah also took part in frequent drug use alongside their new boss. Besides nitrous oxide, there was also the hallucinogen DMT and the popular club drug ketamine — both the kinds of highs that generate a trance-like state.</p><p> 越来越多的谢谢接受他提出的移居到犹他州的提议，还与新上司一起频繁吸毒。除了一氧化二氮外，还有致幻剂DMT和受欢迎的俱乐部药物氯胺酮-两种高点都会产生类似ance的状态。 </p><p>  Paranoia increased in lockstep with the drug use. In Las Vegas, Hsieh, who had spent most of his life espousing values of communities and “holocracy,” or a non-hierarchical management philosophy where no individual was more senior-ranking than another, was famously approachable. For several years, he lived among friends in an Airstream trailer. But in Park City, security guards barricaded sections of the main house, blocking anyone who didn’t have Hsieh’s permission to enter.</p><p>妄想症与吸毒同步增长。在拉斯维加斯，谢辉一生的大部分时间都拥护社区和“专政”的价值观，或者说是一种非等级制的管理哲学，在这种哲学中，没有一个人比另一个人拥有更高的职位。几年来，他与朋友一起住在Airstream拖车中。但是在帕克城，保安人员封锁了主屋的各个部分，封锁了没有谢谢准许进入的任何人。</p><p> By the summer, Hsieh’s entourage had transformed their section of the Aspen Springs community into something of a bunker. Before Hsieh, it was the kind of place where an unknown car parked in the street could prompt a police inspection. But dozens of cars were parked in front of Hsieh’s properties. And the phalanx of security was “intimidating, especially to children that now refuse to walk by the property,” according to an email sent from the director of the neighborhood board to residents, shared with  Forbes.</p><p> 到了夏天，谢恩的随行人员已经将他们在阿斯彭斯普林斯（Aspen Springs）社区的部分变成了一个掩体。在谢女士面前，这是在街上停着一辆不知名的汽车可以促使警方检查的地方。但是谢谢的物业前停着数十辆汽车。社区委员会主任给福布斯的一封电子邮件显示，安全的方阵是“令人恐惧的，尤其是对于现在拒绝在该物业旁行走的儿童而言”。</p><p>  Back in Las Vegas, longtime friends were becoming increasingly concerned by their inability to contact Hsieh. Some visited the city to see what was going on — and some left without being granted an audience. In Las Vegas, “it was an open-door policy, period,” a friend said. “But in Park City, it might take you over an hour and a half to even get to the door. And even then you might not see him.”</p><p>  回到拉斯维加斯，长期的朋友越来越担心自己无法联系谢。一些人参观了这座城市，看看发生了什么事，还有一些人没有得到观众的支持就离开了。一位朋友说，在拉斯维加斯，“这是开放政策。” “但是在帕克城，可能要花一个半小时甚至到门外。即使那样，您可能仍然看不到他。”</p><p> These old friends saw the younger, unknown members of the Park City Crew put a barrier around Hsieh. “There were all these new faces,” says one longtime friend who visited in August. “And yet you’re protecting his privacy to just destroy himself.” By Thanksgiving, that had proven prophetic.</p><p> 这些老朋友看到了帕克城船员的年轻，默默无闻的成员在谢家周围围栏。 “所有这些新面孔都出现了，”一位八月份的老朋友说。 “然而，您正在保护他的隐私以破坏自己。”到感恩节，这已被证明是预言。</p><p> After his passing, Hsieh’s father, Richard Hsieh, and brother, Andrew Hsieh, were made the special administrators to his estate, which is estimated to hold more than half a billion dollars in assets. It’s going to be a large undertaking. While most of the Park City Crew left quickly, a handful have remained.</p><p> 谢贤过世后，其父亲理查德·谢谢（Richard Hsieh）和哥哥安德鲁·谢谢（Andrew Hsieh）被任命为其遗产的特别管理人员，据估计，该遗产拥有超过10亿美元的资产。这将是一项艰巨的任务。虽然大多数帕克城乘员迅速离开，但仍有少数人保留。</p><p> “The sad part,” says an old Las Vegas friend, “is a lot of these people are still living in these houses paid for by their dead friend.”</p><p> 拉斯维加斯的一位老朋友说：“可悲的是，很多人仍然住在他们死去的朋友付钱的房屋中。”</p><p>  I am a staff writer at Forbes.
