On April 4, one of those speakers—a woman named Licho—passed away from tuberculosis and heart disease. She was the last woman alive to speak Sare. For the past 20 years, Licho had worked to preserve the Great Andamanese language for future generations, collaborating with educational organizations and prominent linguists like Anvita Abbi, whom we’ve interviewed for this blog post. As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads to Indigenous communities like the Andaman Islands, Abbi worries for the Indigenous Peoples in remote areas, whose lives and languages are especially at risk. We interviewed Abbi by email.</p><p>在《新闻与观点》上，上个月，只有四个人能说来自安达曼大家庭的语言，安达曼大家庭来自孟加拉湾的安达曼群岛。 4月4日，其中一名发言人-一名叫Licho的妇女-死于肺结核和心脏病。她是最后一个幸存的说萨雷的女人。在过去的20年中，Licho与教育组织和Anvita Abbi等著名语言学家（我们在本博客中采访过）合作，一直致力于为后代保留安达曼语。随着COVID-19大流行病蔓延至安达曼群岛等土著社区，阿比担心边远地区的土著人民的生命和语言受到极大威胁。我们通过电子邮件采访了Abbi。</p><p> Terralingua: We’re deeply sorry to hear of your loss, knowing that Licho was your dear friend as well as a colleague. Can you tell us a bit about her and the work you did together?</p><p> Terralingua：​​得知Licho是您的挚爱朋友和同事，我们深感抱歉。您能谈谈她和您一起做的工作吗？</p><p> Anvita Abbi: I knew and worked with Licho for the last 20 years. My very first introduction to her was when I reached the island in 2000–2001. She was a bold and forthright person and an activist who was ready to fight with the administration for the rights of tribals. She taught me the Present Great Andamanese (PGA) language, a koiné (mixture) of a kind where words are drawn from four North Andamanese languages (Bo, Khora, Sare, and Jero/Jeru), but the grammar is based on Jero. Licho hailed from the Sare background, as her foster grandmother who brought her up was a Sare speaker. With Licho’s death we have lost the last speaker of Sare.</p><p> 安妮塔·阿比（Anvita Abbi）：在过去的20年中，我认识并与Licho合作。我对她的第一个介绍是在2000-2001年到达该岛时。她是一个大胆而直率的人，是一个积极分子，愿意与政府为部落权利而战。她教了我当前的大安达曼语（PGA）语言，一种koiné（混合物），其中的单词来自北安达曼语的四种语言（Bo，Khora，Sare和Jero / Jeru），但语法基于Jero。 Licho来自Sare背景，因为抚养她的寄养祖母是一位Sare演讲者。随着Licho的去世，我们失去了最后一位Sare演说家。</p><p> As I wrote in   Scientific American, Licho had also strongly opposed the construction of a road through the territory of the Jarawa, another endangered tribe living on the Andaman Islands. “The Jarawa will be decimated, just like us,” she feared. Licho worked with the Education Department of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and was one of the smartest women of the tribe. In 2013, I was honoured to have her launch the first book of Great Andamanese creation myths [see photo above].</p><p> 正如我在《科学美国人》中所写的那样，利乔还坚决反对修建一条穿越贾拉瓦（Jarawa）领土的公路。她担心：“像我们一样，贾拉瓦（Jarawa）将被毁灭。”利乔曾在安达曼和尼科巴群岛的教育部门工作，是部落中最聪明的女性之一。 2013年，我很荣幸让她发表第一本伟大的安达曼人创造神话的书[见上图]。</p><p> Licho’s teachings also helped me prepare the encyclopedic dictionary of the language. When I was working on the grammar of the language, I would visit her at Adi Basera—the Tribal Home for the Great Andamanese tribes in Port Blair [the capital of the Andaman Islands]. She always left whatever work she was involved with and sat with me for hours without showing any sign of boredom or tiredness. Her judgement about the grammaticality of the sentences helped me in framing grammatical rules of the language. Often, she would identify the etymology of a word in the language and inform me as to whether it belonged to Sare, Khora, or Jeru.</p><p> Licho的教also还帮助我编写了该语言的百科全书。当我研究语言语法时，我会去Adi Basera拜访她-位于安达曼群岛首府布莱尔港的安达曼人部落部落之家。她总是离开所从事的任何工作，并与我一起坐了几个小时而没有任何无聊或疲倦的迹象。她对句子的语法性的判断帮助我制定了语言的语法规则。通常，她会确定语言中某个单词的词源，并告知我该单词是属于Sare，Khora还是Jeru。</p><p>  Licho was a strong individual who struggled despite all odds for the betterment of her children. Nothing brought her spirits down. She carried the legacy of one of the oldest civilizations, and its language, on this earth. While others in the community were proud to forget their language, she remembered the heritage language and often lamented that the community at large had taken to Andamanese Hindi. Licho was proud of her ancestry—those who were known for valour, courage, and fearlessness. She told me that she was taught hunting in the jungle by her father and grandfather.</p><p>  利乔（Licho）是一个坚强的个体，尽管为了孩子们的进步而千方百计，她仍在奋斗。没有什么使她的情绪低落。她承载着地球上最古老的文明之一的遗产及其语言。当社区中的其他人为忘记他们的语言而感到自豪时，她想起了传统语言，并常常感叹整个社区已将其带到安达曼语的北印度语。利乔（Licho）为自己的祖先感到骄傲，这些祖先以英勇，勇气和无畏而著称。她告诉我，父亲和祖父曾教她在丛林中打猎。</p><p> TL: In your moving   Scientific American blog post, you mentioned that Andaman Islanders descended from one of the ancient “founder populations” of modern humans. Can you tell us briefly about these peoples and their history, both pre- and post-colonization? How many remain today?</p><p> TL：在您《科学美国人》的博客文章中，您提到安达曼岛民是现代人类古老的“奠基人”之一。您能否简要介绍一下这些人及其在殖民之前和之后的历史？今天还有多少？ </p><p> AA: The genetic history of Andamanese tribes in general and the Great Andamanese, in particular, is of seminal importance for understanding the evolution of modern humans. As I wrote in the  Scientific American post, population geneticists believe that the Andaman Islanders descend from one of the founder populations of modern humans, which migrated out of Africa tens of thousands years ago to populate South Asia, Southeast Asia, New Guinea, and Australia. For millennia, they fiercely defended their shores and successfully protected themselves from outsider diseases and other threats. Thus, Great Andamanese are our ancestors, as these Pre-Neolithic tribes are the first settlers of South and Southeast Asia. Other than the Great Andamanese—who now number just 60 in all—the archipelago is also home to roughly 120 Onge and 550 Jarawa, whose languages belong to what I described in 2003 as the Ang family. On North Sentinel Island, yet another tribe of 50 members or so probably speaks an Ang language; all four tribes belong to the Negrito ethnic race.</p><p>机管局：一般来说，安达曼人部落的遗传史，特别是大安达曼人的遗传史，对于理解现代人类的进化具有重要意义。正如我在《科学美国人》杂志上所写的那样，种群遗传学家认为，安达曼岛民是现代人类的奠基人之一，这些人类是几万年前从非洲移居到南亚，东南亚，新几内亚和澳大利亚的人。几千年来，他们一直在捍卫自己的海岸，并成功地保护自己免受外界疾病和其他威胁的侵害。因此，大安达曼人是我们的祖先，因为这些新石器时代前的部落是南亚和东南亚的第一批定居者。除了大安达曼人（目前仅排名60）外，该群岛还居住着大约120个昂热（Onge）和550个贾拉瓦（550 Jarawa），它们的语言属于我在2003年所说的Ang家族。在北前哨岛，还有一个由50名左右的成员组成的部落可能会讲Ang语言。这四个部落都属于Negrito族裔。</p><p> I was fortunate to work on the languages of all except the Sentinelese. My research indicates that we cannot rule out the possibility of multiple dispersions from Africa at different times, and from different locations within Africa. We may also consider positing not one but two separate migrations out of Africa into the Andamans; the first one by the Great Andamanese, and the second one by the Ang family. This view has not been refuted so far.</p><p> 我很幸运能从事除Sentinelese以外的所有语言的工作。我的研究表明，我们不能排除在不同时间和非洲不同地区出现来自非洲的多重分散的可能性。我们还可以考虑将从非洲迁移到安达曼群岛的不是一次而是两次。第一个是大安达曼人，第二个是Ang家族。到目前为止，这一观点尚未得到反驳。</p><p>  The Andaman history of contact with colonial rule is marked by the genocide of their culture, language, and human existence. External contact decimated the tribes gradually as their vulnerable immune systems could not withstand even the common diseases of the outsiders. This is not only true of India, but is prevalent all over the world as Indigenous communities have been shrinking due to outsider contact. Lack of basic health services and information in their native languages also renders them vulnerable to multiple diseases. The latest example is from the Amazon forest, where a 20-year-old woman from the Kokama tribe tested positive for coronavirus.</p><p>  安达曼接触殖民统治的历史以其文化，语言和人类生存的种族灭绝为标志。外部接触逐渐削弱了部落，因为他们脆弱的免疫系统甚至无法承受外人的常见疾病。这不仅在印度如此，而且在全世界范围内都普遍存在，因为土著人社区由于与外界的接触而不断缩小。缺乏以其母语提供的基本卫生服务和信息，也使他们容易感染多种疾病。最新的例子是来自亚马逊森林，那里有一个来自角冈部落的20岁妇女，其冠状病毒检测呈阳性。</p><p> TL: Yes, colonists have long brought illnesses to hunter-gather societies who have no immunity to these diseases. As coronavirus sweeps the globe, what are your concerns for the Andaman Islanders—and for other rural Indigenous communities? What are the implications for both lives and endangered languages?</p><p> TL：是的，殖民者长期以来给那些对这些疾病没有免疫力的猎人社会带来了疾病。随着冠状病毒席卷全球，您对安达曼岛民以及其他农村土著社区有何担忧？对生命和濒临灭绝的语言有什么影响？</p><p> AA: The Andaman islanders are in constant exposure to the locals [migrants who came from mainland India to make Andaman their homes in the early ’60s and ’70s] as some of the younger members of the Great Andamanese tribe are employed in the public sector. Others live in Port Blair and frequent the markets on daily basis. Jarawa are the ones who are very vulnerable, as the Andaman Trunk Road cuts through their forest and is frequented by human safaris of hundreds of people every day. It is a common sight to see Jarawa visiting roadside kiosks. Although Onges live far off in Little Andaman, almost 100 kms away from the city of Port Blair, they are equally vulnerable because their reserve houses several government officials and doctors. Low immunity to various city diseases and the lack of available literature in local languages on preventing the spread of COVID-19 make these three tribes vulnerable to succumbing to the virus. If that happens, there will be no way to save them, and we will lose one of the most ancient living civilizations and languages of the world. As of now, it appears that these tribes are sitting on the tip of a volcano of viruses that’s ready to erupt. They all saved themselves against the tsunami of 2004 because of their Indigenous knowledge, but the coronavirus is a new demon brought by the city dwellers.</p><p> 机管局：安达曼岛居民经常与当地人接触（从印度大陆来的安达曼人在60年代和70年代初成为家园的移民），因为安达曼大部落的一些年轻成员在公共部门工作。 。其他人则居住在布莱尔港（Port Blair），每天都在逛市场。贾拉瓦（Jarawa）是最脆弱的人，因为安达曼主干道（Andaman Trunk Road）穿过森林，每天都有成百上千的人到此游历。看到Jarawa参观路边小亭是很常见的现象。尽管昂格斯（Onges）居住在距离布莱尔港（Port Blair）市近100公里的小安达曼（Little Andaman）较远的地方，但他们同样脆弱，因为他们的后备房里有几名政府官员和医生。对各种城市疾病的免疫力低下，以及缺乏当地语言的文献来防止COVID-19的传播，使这三个部落易受该病毒的折磨。如果发生这种情况，将无法挽救它们，我们将失去世界上最古老的人类文明和语言之一。截至目前，这些部落似乎正坐在准备爆发的病毒火山的顶端。由于他们的土著知识，他们都拯救了自己免受2004年海啸的侵害，但是冠状病毒是城市居民带来的新恶魔。</p><p>  TL: That is extremely concerning, yes. Let’s talk a bit about the history and structure of Great Andamanese languages . Can you tell our readers what’s so special about this language?</p><p>  TL：非常令人担忧，是的。让我们来谈谈大安达曼语的历史和结构。您能告诉我们的读者这种语言有什么特别之处吗？</p><p> AA: My research established that Great Andamanic is the sixth language family of India, which had ten languages in its fold—but most of them became extinct by 1935. Great Andamanic shares no features with other Andamanese languages (such as Jarawa and Onge), nor with languages spoken in mainland India. The structure of Great Andamanic languages is distinct among language families in that it is based on an anthropocentric viewpoint. As I wrote in the  Scientific American article,</p><p> 机管局：我的研究确定，大安达曼语是印度的第六种语言，拥有十种语言，但到了1935年绝大部分都已绝种。也不使用印度大陆使用的语言。大安达曼语的语言结构在各种语言家族中是不同的，因为它是基于人类中心观的。正如我在《科学美国人》文章中所写的那样， </p><p> The human body is the primary model for expressing concepts of spatial orientation, categories and relations between objects and actions and events. The body is divided into seven zones, each designated by an abstract symbol that is attached to nouns, verbs, adjectives and other grammatical categories to create different meanings. So, for instance, the prefix er- denotes an external body part, whereas e- denotes an internal one… The system appears to have arisen in a prehistoric era when human beings conceptualized their world through their bodies and may shed light on the early stages of language evolution.</p><p>人体是表达空间定向，类别以及对象与动作和事件之间的关系的概念的主要模型。身体分为七个区域，每个区域由一个抽象符号指定，该符号附加在名词，动词，形容词和其他语法类别上，以创建不同的含义。因此，例如，前缀er-代表身体的外部部分，而e-则代表内部的身体部分...该系统似乎起源于史前时代，当时人类通过其身体来概念化其世界，并可能在早期阶段有所启发语言进化论。</p><p> As an example of the prefixes:  e-tei will refer to “someone’s blood or fever” and  e-binge will mean “to think” because it is internalized activity. Words for flora and fauna are never preceded by any bodily markers, unless one is describing a part of the object. For instance,  tech means “leaves,” but if one is describing the leaves of a tree (which are still on the tree), it will be rendered as  er-tech. These bodily markers are found throughout all categories of Great Andamanese grammar—a unique feature which has not been attested in any other language of the world, to the best of my knowledge.</p><p> 作为前缀的示例：e-tei表示“某人的血液或发烧”，而e-binge则表示“思考”，因为它是内部活动。除非有人在描述物体的一部分，否则动植物词语之前都不得带有任何身体标记。例如，技术的意思是“叶子”，但是如果人们描述一棵树的叶子（仍在树上），它将被渲染为er-tech。这些身体标记在安达曼语语法的所有类别中都可以找到，据我所知，这是世界上任何其他语言都没有证明的独特功能。</p><p> TL: Some might argue for the case of homogeneity, that fewer languages spoken by many worldwide is simpler. We have a different perspective here at Terralingua, of course! From your perspective, what is the value of maintaining the vitality of these endangered languages? What do they have to teach us?</p><p> TL：有人可能会为同质性辩护，世界上许多人说的语言越少越简单。当然，在Terralingua，我们有不同的看法！从您的角度来看，保持这些濒危语言的生命力有什么价值？他们必须教我们什么？</p><p> AA: Who knows better than  Terralingua about the merits of linguistic diversity? As a linguist I would like to draw the attention of your readers to the diverse linguistic structures that inform us about the various ways human being can perceive the universe and build their cognitive power. I believe that languages carry evidence of earlier environment, habitat, beliefs, and practices which are no longer in the memory of the community. Hence, the death of a language signifies the closure of the link with its ancient heritage. Linguistic diversity has given us the power of sustenance, tolerance, and acceptance of “the other.” Uniformity kills, while diversity helps us to adapt and accommodate, the two reasons why Homo Sapiens have survived so long. Our secret of sustenance on this earth lies in the mantra of diversity. If we lose this—whether it is biological, cultural, or linguistic—we are bound to be exterminated from this earth much faster than anticipated.</p><p> AA：在语言多样性的优点上，谁比Terralingua更好？作为一名语言学家，我想提请读者注意多种多样的语言结构，这些结构使我们了解了人类感知宇宙并增强其认知能力的各种方式。我相信语言可以提供早期环境，栖息地，信仰和习俗的证据，这些已不再是社区的记忆。因此，一门语言的死亡意味着与它的古老遗产的联系的关闭。语言的多样性赋予我们寄托，宽容和接受“另一个”的力量。统一杀死人，而多样性则帮助我们适应和适应，这是智人存活了这么长时间的两个原因。我们在这个地球上维生的秘密在于多元化的口头禅。如果我们丢掉了它（无论是生物学的，文化的还是语言的），那么我们必定会比预期的更快地被灭绝。</p><p> With the advent of literacy and education, diverse spoken languages eventually became marginalized. Single-language domination in a plurilingual society pushed many languages to a minority status, even though some of these had a larger number of speakers than those on the throne of dominance. Linguistic imperialism and linguistic marginalization are two points of the same spectrum. Thus, the apartheid situation is created by us through adopting an education policy that is not inclusive in nature. We have to remember that multilingualism brings in the acceptance of others and social cohesion.</p><p> 随着识字和教育的到来，多种语言最终被边缘化。在多元社会中，单一语言的统治将许多语言推向了少数群体的地位，尽管其中某些语言的发言者人数比占主导地位的人更多。语言帝国主义和语言边缘化是同一频谱的两点。因此，种族隔离局势是我们通过采取一种非包容性的教育政策而造成的。我们必须记住，多语制带来了对他人的接受和社会凝聚力。</p><p> When lexicons and grammar represent cultural and ecological knowledge as well as the specific worldview, the loss of a language is not merely a case of language death but rather the extinction of hundreds and thousands of years of accumulated experience and values. Language loss is often not voluntary; it frequently involves violations of human rights, with oppression or repression of speakers of minority languages.</p><p> 当词汇和语法代表文化和生态知识以及特定的世界观时，语言的丧失不仅是语言死亡的情况，而且是数百年累积的经验和价值观的灭绝。语言损失通常不是自愿的；它经常涉及侵犯人权，压迫或压制说少数民族语言的人。</p><p> TL: How do the younger generations of Andamanese feel about these languages? Are they interested in learning them in any capacity? Are there any other language champions in the community? What is being done to stimulate pride and interest?</p><p> TL：年轻的安达曼人对这些语言有什么感觉？他们有兴趣以任何身份学习他们吗？社区中还有其他语言冠军吗？正在采取什么措施来激发自豪感和兴趣？ </p><p> AA: It is a pathetic situation that the youth are happy to forget their language, as they want to assimilate with the dominant crowd of Hindi speakers. Single-language domination and ignoring the Indigenous languages of the region in school education encourages an inferiority complex among younger generations of the Great Andamanese. Jarawa and Onge, on the contrary, retain their languages as they are away from the perils of modern civilization.</p><p>机管局：这是一个可悲的局面，年轻人乐于忘记他们的语言，因为他们想与占主导地位的印地语使用者同化。在学校教育中，单一语言的统治和对该地区土著语言的忽视鼓励了大安达曼人的年轻一代的自卑感。相反，Jarawa和Onge保留了他们的语言，因为他们远离了现代文明的危险。</p><p> TL: As you remember Licho and the work you did together, what work will you carry forward?</p><p> TL：当您还记得Licho和您一起完成的工作时，您将开展哪些工作？</p><p> I have developed a kind of reverence for the Great Andamanese language, primarily because of my association with Licho and Nao Jr. (who died in January 2009). This reverence has inspired me to write an encyclopedic talking dictionary; a grammar of the language; educational material on Indigenous knowledge; a book of alphabets; a book of names and classification of birds ( Luisa Maffi, the Director of Terralingua, wrote the foreword for it); a CD of songs, and hundreds of images. Most of the materials are being archived with the  ELDP program of SOAS (Endangered Languages Documentation Program at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, UK.</p><p> 我对大安达曼语表达了一种敬意，主要是因为我与Licho和Nao Jr.（他们于2009年1月去世）交往。这种敬畏感激发了我写一部有声百科全书的字典。语言的语法；关于土著知识的教育材料；一本书的字母；一本鸟类名称和分类书（Terralingua的负责人路易莎·马菲（Luisa Maffi）为此写了前言）； CD的歌曲和数百张图像。大多数材料都通过SOAS的ELDP程序（位于英国伦敦的东方与非洲研究学院的濒危语言文档程序）进行了归档。</p><p>  My future plans are to bring out a book on the folklore of the language. When a language dies, the narrative power dies first; however, songs stay in the memory of the community. With the help of Nao Jr., I was able to elicit 10 remarkable and very unusual stories. Boa Sr.—the last speaker of the Bo language, who died in January 2010—sang several songs for me. All these are included in the forthcoming book, which is going to be published by Niyogi Books in New Delhi.</p><p>  我未来的计划是出版一本有关该语言的民俗书籍。语言死后，叙事力先死；但是，歌曲仍留在社区中。在小Nao的帮助下，我得出了10个引人注目的非常不寻常的故事。 Boa Sr.是Bo语言的最后一位讲者，于2010年1月去世，他为我演唱了几首歌。所有这些都包含在即将出版的书中，该书将由新德里的Niyogi Books出版。</p><p> I will be incredibly happy if I am given the opportunity to introduce the language in the schools of Andaman. I will be equally happy to contribute in writing school material for Indian children, introducing them to the extensive Indigenous knowledge about flora and fauna and other ecological aspects of the archipelago of Andaman. A similar exercise was done a few years ago with Terralingua to introduce Canadian children to the world of Great Andamanese.</p><p> 如果我有机会在安达曼学校介绍这种语言，我将感到非常高兴。我同样乐于为印度儿童编写学校教材，向他们介绍有关安达曼群岛动植物和其他生态方面的广泛土著知识。几年前，Terralingua进行了类似的练习，向加拿大儿童介绍了大安达曼人的世界。</p><p> TL: Thank you so much for taking the time to share your memories of Licho, your insights on the Great Andamanese language, and these beautiful photos with us.</p><p> TL：非常感谢您抽出宝贵的时间与我们分享您对Licho的回忆，您对安达曼语的见解以及这些精美的照片。</p><p> Author’s Note: In 2015, Anvita Abbi’s  “Vanishing Voices of the Great Andamanese” project was one of the case studies featured in the book   Biocultural Diversity Conservation: A Global Sourcebook by Luisa Maffi and Ellen Woodley.
