The outage impacted users trying to install .NET Core, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft SQL Server for Linux (yes, that&#39;s a thing) and more\u2014as well as  Azure&#39;s own devops pipelines.\n We first became aware of the problem Wednesday evening when we saw 404 errors in the output of  apt update\u00a0on an Ubuntu workstation with Microsoft Teams installed. The outage is somewhat better-documented at this .NET Core-issue  report on Github, with many users from all around the world sharing their experiences and theories.\n The short version is that the entire repository cluster that serves all Linux packages for Microsoft was completely down\u2014issuing a range of HTTP 404 (content not found) and 500 (Internal Server Error) messages for any URL\u2014for roughly 18 hours. Microsoft engineer Rahul Bhandari confirmed the outage roughly five hours after it was initially reported, with a cryptic comment about the infrastructure team &#34;running into some space issues.&#34;\n Eighteen hours after the issue was detailed, Bhandari said that the mirrors were once again available\u2014although with temporarily degraded performance, likely due to cold caches. In this update, Bhandari said that the original cause of the outage was &#34;a regression in [ apt\u00a0repositories] during some feature migration work that resulted in those packages becoming unavailable on the mirrors.&#34;\n We&#39;re still waiting for a comprehensive incident report, since Bhandari&#39;s status updates provide clues but no real explanations. The good news: We can confirm that\u00a0 packages.microsoft.com\u00a0is indeed up once again, and it is serving packages as it should.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 03:40:10", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "linux,microsoft", "title": "Microsoft\u7684Linux\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\u5df2\u5173\u95ed18\u6b21\u4ee5\u4e0a ", "title_en": "Microsoft\u2019s Linux repositories were down for 18+ hours", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/microsofts-linux-repositories-were-down-for-18-hours/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["linux", "microsoft"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "dec753757e1a32b2424679bcdbe8720b.jpg", "infoid": 1066556, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\uff08CNN Business\uff09\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bb6\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u6b63\u5728\u6566\u4fc3\u5fae\u8f6f\u5728\u53cd\u5bf9\u5176\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u6bd4\u5c14\u76d6\u8328\u7684\u4e0d\u5f53\u6307\u63a7\u540e\u505a\u66f4\u591a\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6027\u9a9a\u6270\u3002\n \u5728\u5468\u4e09\u516c\u5e03\u7684\u80a1\u4e1c\u51b3\u8bae\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6295\u8d44\u516c\u53f8Arjuna Capital\u547c\u5401\u5fae\u8f6f\u53d1\u5e03\u4e00\u5e74\u4e00\u5ea6\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5176\u6027\u9a9a\u6270\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u8c03\u67e5\u6d89\u53ca\u672c\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6d89\u5acc\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002\n \uff06\uff0334;\u7531\u4e8e\u4f17\u591a\u7684\u6027\u9a9a\u6270\u58f0\u79f0\u548c\u636e\u79f0\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5fae\u8f6f\u53d7\u5230\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u516c\u4f17\u5ba1\u67e5\u3002\u5a1c\u5854\u838e\u7f8a\u8089\uff0c\u963f\u5c14\u6751\u9996\u90fd\uff06\uff0339;\u5728\u4e00\u4efd\u58f0\u660e\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u3002 \uff06\uff0334;\u6bd4\u5c14\u76d6\u8328\u7684\u62a5\u544a\uff06\uff0339;\u636e\u79f0\u5bf9\u5fae\u8f6f\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u4e0d\u5f53\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u6027\u8fdb\u6b65\u53ea\u4f1a\u62c5\u5fc3\u4ee4\u4eba\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8d28\u7591\u7531\u6700\u9ad8\u9886\u5bfc\u7684\u6587\u5316\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\n        \u6700\u8fd1\u51e0\u5468\u6709\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6307\u63a7\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u5173\u4e8e\u5927\u95e8\uff06\uff0339;\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5728\u4ed6\u7684\u59bb\u5b50\u79bb\u5a5a\u540e\uff0c\u6885\u7433\u8fbe\u6cd5\u56fd\u5927\u95e8\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6307\u63a7\u57285\u6708\u521d\u5ba3\u5e03\u3002\n  \u5927\u90e8\u5206\u7126\u70b9\u4e00\u76f4\u57282000\u5e74\u7684\u76d6\u8328\u548c\u5fae\u8f6f\u5458\u5de5\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6001\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u7cfb\u76d6\u8328\u548c\uff0339;\u4ee3\u8868\u5df2\u627f\u8ba4\uff0c\u636e\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u4ed6\u62c5\u4efb\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u4e3b\u5e2d\u3002 Microsoft\uff06\uff0339;\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u4e24\u5e74\u524d\u53d1\u8d77\u4e86\u8c03\u67e5\u3002\u76d6\u8328\u57282020\u5e74\u521d\u79bb\u5f00\u4e86\u5fae\u8f6f\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u7684\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u76d6\u8328\u53d1\u8a00\u4eba\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e0e\u8c03\u67e5\u65e0\u5173\u3002\n \u5fae\u8f6f\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u6307\u8d23\u6027\u522b\u6b67\u89c6\u548c\u6027\u9a9a\u6270\u7684\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6307\u8d23\uff0c\u5e76\u4e8e2015\u5e74\u88ab\u8bc9\u8bbc\u884c\u52a8\u8bc9\u8bbc\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u540d\u524d\u96c7\u5458\u6307\u63a7\u5979\u88ab\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u5730\u6b67\u89c6\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u5b83\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u8868\u793a\uff06\uff0334;\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u591a\u5143\u5316\u7684\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\n 2019\u5e74\uff0cMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella\u5ba3\u5e03\u5927\u4fee\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u7ed9\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u4fe1\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u4e89\u8bae\uff0c\u5411\u5458\u5de5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u652f\u6301\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002 \n\uff06\uff0334;

Natasha Lamb, Arjuna Capital&#39;s managing partner, said in a  statement. &#34;Reports of Bill Gates&#39; alleged inappropriate relationships and sexual advances towards Microsoft employees have only exacerbated concerns, putting in question the culture set by top leadership.&#34;\n        There have been a range of allegations and reports in recent weeks about Gates&#39; workplace behavior. The allegations emerged  after his divorce from his wife, Melinda French Gates, was announced in early May.\n  Much of the focus has been on an affair between Gates and a Microsoft employee in 2000, a relationship Gates&#39; representatives have acknowledged and which reportedly took place  while he was chairman of the board. Microsoft&#39;s board said it launched an investigation into the matter two years ago. Gates  left Microsoft&#39;s board in early 2020, though a Gates spokesperson has said the decision was unrelated to the investigation.\n Microsoft has faced broader accusations from employees alleging gender discrimination and sexual harassment, and was hit with a  class action lawsuit in 2015 in which a former employee alleged she was unfairly discriminated against. The company said at the time it was &#34;committed to a diverse workforce.&#34;\n In 2019, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced an overhaul of the way the company handles HR disputes in a  letter to employees, pledging more support to employees and greater transparency.\n  &#34;The Microsoft of 2021 is very different from the Microsoft of 2000,&#34; Nadella said in an interview on CNBC. &#34;To me and to everyone at Microsoft, our focus on our culture, our diversity, our inclusion, in particular, the everyday experience of our people is super important, it&#39;s a huge priority.&#34;\n In its resolution, Arjuna Capital urged the company to release the results of independent investigations into misconduct allegations, as well as the number of sexual harassment cases investigated.\n &#34;To avoid legal and reputational risk and maintain shareholder value, Microsoft must create a culture of accountability and transparency, protecting employees from harassment and discrimination,&#34; the investment firm said.\n   Arjuna Capital has  pressured tech companies and  major businesses \u2014 including  Facebook  (  FB),  Amazon  (  AMZN),  Alphabet  (  GOOGL) and  Twitter  (  TWTR) \u2014 on a variety of issues including pay disparities, sexual harassment, civil rights and climate change.\n Its latest resolution for Microsoft will be introduced at the company&#39;s shareholder meeting this December.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 03:39:48", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "microsoft,\u80a1\u4e1c,misconduct,\u6027\u9a9a\u6270", "title": "Microsoft\u80a1\u4e1c\u63a8\u52a8\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u6bd4\u5c14\u76d6\u8328\u4e0d\u5f53\u6307\u63a7\u540e\u89e3\u51b3\u6027\u9a9a\u6270 ", "title_en": "Microsoft shareholder pushes company to address sexual harassment after Bill Gates misconduct allegations", "transed": 1, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/16/tech/microsoft-bill-gates-sexual-harassment-arjuna-capital/index.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["microsoft", "\u80a1\u4e1c", "\u6027\u9a9a\u6270"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f34abd55e53491ff40cdf6305a836282.jpg", "infoid": 1066555, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u660e\u667a\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4e13\u95e8\u4ece\u4e8b\u8de8\u5883\u8d27\u5e01\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u60f3\u5411\u751f\u6d3b\u5728\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u4eba\u6c47\u6b3e\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u96f6\u552e\u94f6\u884c\u5728\u5916\u6c47\u8d39\u7528\uff0c\u5916\u56fd\u4ea4\u6613\u8d39\u7b49\u4e2d\u6536\u8d39\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\u8d39\u7528\n \u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u7740\u540d\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u897f\u8054\u6c47\u6b3e\u548cMoneygram\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8fd9\u4e9b\u516c\u53f8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u65b9\u4fbf\u7684\u659c\u5761\u548c\u8d8a\u659c\u5761\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u4ecd\u7136\u6bd4\u660e\u667a\u66f4\u8d35\u3002\n  \u901a\u8fc7WISE\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u94f6\u884c\u8f6c\u8d26\u6216\u501f\u8bb0\u5361\u5c06\u8d44\u91d1\u4e0a\u4f20\u5230\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u660e\u667a\u8d26\u6237\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ee5\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u8d27\u5e01\u6c47\u6b3e\u7ed9\u6536\u4ef6\u4eba\u7684\u94f6\u884c\u8d26\u6237\u3002\u5f53\u6d89\u53ca\u5230\u56fa\u5b9a\u548c\u53ef\u53d8\u8d39\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8bd5\u56fe\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u900f\u660e\u548c\u524d\u671f\u3002\n \u6700\u521d\u4e8e2011\u5e74\u521b\u7acb\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u6536\u5165\u4ece4.22\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u589e\u52a0\u52305.86\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u8d22\u653f\u5e74\u5ea6\uff08\u5206\u522b\u4e3a3.01\u4ebf\u82f1\u9551\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u667a\u6167\u589e\u957f\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\u3002\u5b83\u5728\u7a0e\u524d\u4ee3\u8868\u4e865700\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff084100\u4e07\u82f1\u9551\uff09 -

If you want to send money to someone living in another country, traditional retail banks charge a lot in foreign exchange fees, foreign transaction fees, etc.\n Of course, there are some well-known alternative options, such as Western Union and MoneyGram. While those companies provide some convenient on-ramp and off-ramp methods, they\u2019re still more expensive than Wise.\n  With Wise, users first upload money to their Wise account using a bank transfer or a debit card. They can then send money in another currency to a recipient\u2019s bank account. The company tries to be as transparent and upfront as possible when it comes to fixed and variable fees.\n Originally founded in 2011, Wise has grown quite a lot as its revenue grew from $422 million to $586 million in its most recent financial year (from \u00a3303 million to \u00a3421 million respectively). It represents $57 million (\u00a341 million) in profit before tax \u2014 the company says it has been profitable since 2017.\n Overall, Wise has 10 million customers who process around $7 billion (\u00a35 billion) in cross-border transactions every month. More recently, the company diversified its revenue by adding new products.\n For instance, customers can hold money in 56 currencies in their Wise accounts. They get account numbers in 10 different currencies as well as a debit card. This feature is particularly useful for freelancers who want to accept payments in another country or people moving abroad for a year or two.\n The company has also expanded beyond B2C with Wise Business. Those accounts work a bit like regular Wise accounts, but with multiple users and additional features. Wise also powers cross-border transactions in third-party services, such as Monzo and N26.\n Opting for a direct listing is an interesting move. A few companies have chosen direct listings in the U.S., such as Spotify, Coinbase and Slack. It means that you\u2019re confident there\u2019ll be enough interests from investors as banks aren\u2019t helping you with your introduction.\n It also means that Wise doesn\u2019t need more money as a direct listing doesn\u2019t let you raise additional capital.\n Like many tech companies, Wise plans to introduce a dual-class share structure, which means that all of Wise\u2019s existing shareholders will get more votes per share for a while.

The facility, which the company describes as a \u201cmega microfactory\u201d will include a paint, body shop and general assembly plant and is expected to open in 2023. The site is near a number of manufacturing and logistics businesses, Aquila noted.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a hub that we think is going to grow like crazy,\u201d Aquila said at the event. \u201cIn addition to that, it puts you dead center for logistics and movement across North America, so you can get anywhere, same day and back is pretty important.\u201d\n  Canoo, which has said it will  deliver its first EV in the fourth quarter of 2022, also announced it is partnering with Netherlands-based contract manufacturer VDL Nedcar to handle initial production while the factory is being built.\n Canoo\u2019s announcement comes nearly a year after Oklahoma lost its bid to convince Tesla to build its next factory in the state. Tesla ultimately  picked a site near Austin for the factory, which it has said will produce the Cybertruck, the Tesla Semi and the Model Y and Model 3 for sales to customers on the East Coast.\n \u201cWe\u2019re super pumped \u2014 we think we are the flavor of the month and we are the right place for manufacturing,\u201d Gov. Kevin Stitt said, noting that the state has the lowest electricity costs in the entire country. Those lower rates have helped attract companies like Google, which operates a data center in Pryor.\n Canoo\u2019s investor day featured a variety of engineers, designers and executives all of whom focused on certain aspects of the company\u2019s vision. Canoo is focused on products for consumers and commercial customers. All of Canoo\u2019s EVs will share the same skateboard and use different cabins or \u201ctop hats\u201d that can be paired to create unique vehicles. The company has unveiled several vehicles, including an electric microbus, a pickup and one designed for business-to-business applications.\n It was also the first major public event with Aquila steering the company that has had a bumpy ride in the past year.\n Canoo started as Evelozcity in 2017, founded by former Faraday Future executives Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz. The company rebranded as Canoo in spring 2019 and debuted its first vehicle several months later. The unique-looking vehicle and Canoo\u2019s initial plan to offer it only as a subscription helped the company gain the attention of investors and the media.\u00a0Canoo even landed a  partnership with Hyundai\u00a0to co-develop EVs, but that deal fell apart earlier this year after the company changed its business model and decided to not offer engineering services to other automakers, according to comments made in March by Aquila.\n Canoo also lost its cofounders, first Krause, and  more recently Kranz. And in May, the company disclosed that is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The investigation is broad and covers the special purpose acquisition company Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp.\u2019s initial public offering and merger with Canoo, the company\u2019s operations, business model, revenues, revenue strategy, customer agreements, earnings and other related topics, along with the recent departures of certain of the company\u2019s officers, according to a quarterly earnings report posted May 17.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 03:38:48", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4fc4\u514b\u62c9\u8377\u9a6c\u5dde,build", "title": "\u5728\u4fc4\u514b\u62c9\u8377\u9a6c\u5dde\u5efa\u9020\u5176\u7b2c\u4e00\u5bb6\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5de5\u5382 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tCanoo to build its first electric vehicle factory in Oklahoma\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/canoo-to-build-its-first-electric-vehicle-factory-in-oklahoma/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4fc4\u514b\u62c9\u8377\u9a6c\u5dde", "build"]}]
