He had suffered from tuberculosis since early 1820 and, after months of distress and pain, finally succumbed to the disease at the age of just 25. Keats was a failed medical student, who had swapped operations for odes after realising his poetic talent. He had been writing for six years and publishing his poetry for four. Contrary to popular belief, Keats was not considered a renowned poet during his lifetime. His verses were vilified in the press and his works had failed to sell.</p><p>两百年前，1821年2月23日，约翰·济慈（John Keats）去世。自1820年初以来，他就一直患有肺结核，在经历了数月的痛苦和痛苦之后，他终于在25岁的时候死于该病。济慈是一名失败的医学生，他在意识到自己富有诗意的才华之后将手术换成了颂歌。他已经写作六年了，出版诗歌已经四年了。与普遍的看法相反，济慈在一生中没有被视为著名的诗人。他的诗句在媒体上受到了侮辱，他的作品没有卖出去。</p><p> After his death in Rome, Keats’ belongings were burned to prevent the spread of infection and his body speedily interred in the city’s Protestant Cemetery. All that was left of the poet were his words and the memories held dear by those he left behind. Keats himself believed his poetical efforts were for nothing. He wrote in a February 1820 letter to his fiancée Fanny Brawne: ‘I have left no immortal work behind me – nothing to make my friends proud of my memory.’ With his untimely death, it seemed probable that Keats would fade into obscurity, like many of the poets of the Romantic period who are now largely forgotten. He did not, however, and his name lives on. This was due to the efforts made by his friends, associates and admirers after his death. Many of their names are as well known as his own, while others languish in relative obscurity.</p><p> 济慈在罗马去世后，其财物被焚烧以防止感染蔓延，他的尸体迅速被埋葬在该市的新教公墓。诗人只剩下他的话语和他留下的人留下的宝贵记忆。济慈本人认为他的诗歌创作是徒劳的。他在1820年2月给未婚妻范妮·布劳恩（Fanny Brawne）的信中写道：“我没有留下不朽的作品，没有让我的朋友为我的记忆感到骄傲。”随着他过世的去世，济慈很可能会变得晦涩难懂，就像浪漫主义时期的许多诗人如今已被广泛遗忘。但是，他没有，他的名字继续存在。这是由于他死后朋友，同事和仰慕者的努力。他们的许多名字和他的名字一样众所周知，而其他名字则相对模糊。</p><p> The first of Keats’ admirers who assisted in the recuperation of his reputation was his fellow poet, Percy Bysshe Shelley. The two men had known each other in London and upon hearing of Keats’ illness Shelley invited him to Pisa to recover. Keats never made it that far. Like many, Shelley believed that negative reviews of Keats’ work had led to his death and Shelley himself was so affected by it that he wrote the elegy  Adonais in Keats’ memory: ‘I weep for Adonais – he is dead!’ The connection between the two men was made even clearer after Shelley’s drowning in July 1822. His body was washed ashore after ten days and partly identified through the copy of Keats’ poems found in his pocket. The two poets’ early deaths – both in Italy – and the burial of Shelley also in Rome’s Protestant Cemetery further entwined their legacies.</p><p> 济慈最早的崇拜者是他的诗人珀西·比希·雪莱（Percy Bysshe Shelley）。这两个人在伦敦相识，谢尔利得知吉兹患病后，便邀请他去比萨康复。济慈从未做到那么远。像许多人一样，雪莱相信对济慈工作的负面评论导致他去世，而雪莱本人也深受其影响，以至于他在济慈的记忆中写下了挽歌阿多奈斯：“我为阿杜奈哭泣-他死了！”雪莱在1822年7月溺水后，两个人变得更加清楚。十天后，他的尸体被冲上岸，并通过口袋里发现的济慈诗歌的一部分得以部分辨认。两位诗人的早逝-都在意大利-以及在罗马的新教公墓埋葬的雪莱，进一步使他们的遗产更加缠绕。</p><p> Interest in Keats appeared to go hand-in-hand with that of Shelley: as Shelley’s  Adonais increased in popularity, readers were also intrigued by the poem’s subject.</p><p> 对济慈的兴趣似乎与雪莱的兴趣并驾齐驱：随着雪莱的Adonais越来越流行，这首诗的主题也吸引了读者。</p><p> The critic and essayist Leigh Hunt is notable as the first to introduce Keats and Shelley to one another and to the reading public, through his liberal paper, the  Examiner. Hunt, a fascinating radical figure in his own right, was a key influence on Keats, encouraging him during his life and promoting his work after his death. His 1828  Lord Byron and Some of His Contemporaries included the first biographical account of Keats. In it he described Keats as:</p><p> 评论家和散文家利·亨特（Leigh Hunt）是第一个通过他的自由派论文《考官》（Examiner）向人们介绍济慈和雪莱并向大众介绍的人。亨特本身就是个令人着迷的激进人物，对济慈产生了关键影响，在他的一生中鼓励他，并在他去世后促进他的工作。他的1828年拜伦勋爵和一些他的同时代人包括济慈的第一个传记记载。他在其中将济慈描述为：</p><p> A man of genius … one of those who are too genuine and too original to be properly appreciated at first, but whose time for applause will infallibly arrive.</p><p> 一个天才的人…那些太真实，太原始以至于一开始就不应该被欣赏的人，但是他的掌声将无休止地到来。</p><p> Although only a short piece, Leigh Hunt’s chapter on Keats contained snapshots of his life, as well as some of his shorter poems.</p><p> 虽然只有一小段，但雷·亨特（Leigh Hunt）在济慈上的一章包含了他一生的快照以及他的一些短诗。 </p><p> Oddly, there was never a full-length biography of Keats written by anyone who knew him. The closest thing Keats had to a biographer was his friend, Charles Armitage Brown, who accompanied the poet to Scotland. He was his sometime collaborator and nursed him during his illness. Although Brown planned to write a biography, he never completed it. Before his emigration to New Zealand in 1841, he passed all his Keats manuscripts to Richard Monckton Milnes, later Baron Broughton. It was Milnes who eventually wrote the first biography, or as he called it, ‘a signal monument of the worth and genius of Keats’, in 1848, which included many of the poems published for the first time.</p><p>奇怪的是，从来没有任何认识他的人写过济慈的完整传记。济慈与传记作家最接近的是他的朋友查尔斯·阿米蒂奇·布朗（Charles Armitage Brown），他陪同诗人到了苏格兰。他曾经是他的合作者，在生病期间一直为他提供护理。尽管布朗计划写传记，但他从未完成。在1841年移居新西兰之前，他将所有济慈手稿都交给了理查德·蒙克顿·米尔尼斯（Richard Monckton Milnes），后来又传给了布劳顿男爵（Baron Broughton）。米尔恩斯（Milnes）最终写下了第一本传记，或如他所称，是“济慈价值和才华的信号纪念碑”，其中包括许多首次出版的诗歌。</p><p> Boosted by Milnes’ biography, Keats’ poetic reputation flourished in the Victorian era. Many key literary figures were influenced by him, including Robert Browning, who in 1825 was reportedly given original copies of Keats’ poetry; Browning’s wife, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, who referred to Keats in her 1857 poem  Aurora Leigh (‘By Keats’s soul, the man who never stepped / In gradual progress like another man’); and Alfred, Lord Tennyson, whose poetry is often recognised as a homage to Keats’ style.</p><p> 受米尔恩斯传记的提振，济慈的诗歌声望在维多利亚时代蓬勃发展。许多重要的文学人物都受到他的影响，其中包括罗伯特·布朗宁（Robert Browning），据报道他于1825年获得了济慈诗歌的原始副本。勃朗宁的妻子伊丽莎白·巴雷特·勃朗宁（Elizabeth Barrett Browning），在1857年的诗歌《极光》中提到了济慈（“济慈的灵魂，这个男人从不像其他人那样循序渐进地前进”）；坦尼森勋爵（Lord Tennyson）和阿尔弗雷德（Alfred）的诗歌通常被认为是对济慈风格的致敬。</p><p> The art world was also inspired by Keats’ words – particularly the rebellious Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, who saw their ideals reflected in his poems. John Everett Millais and William Holman Hunt were so enamoured with Keats’ poetry that the subjects of many of their paintings were taken from them. This included Millais’  Lorenzo and Isabella and both artists’ depictions of  The Eve of St Agnes.</p><p> 济慈的话语也启发了艺术界，尤其是叛逆的拉斐尔前派兄弟会，他的诗歌反映了他们的理想。约翰·埃弗里特·米莱斯（John Everett Millais）和威廉·霍尔曼·亨特（William Holman Hunt）对济慈的诗歌如此着迷，以至于许多绘画作品的题材都取材于他们。其中包括米莱的洛伦佐（Lorenzo）和伊莎贝拉（Isabella）以及两位艺术家对圣艾格尼丝前夕的描绘。</p><p> Through his poetry and paintings influenced by them, Keats’ was popularised for a Victorian audience.</p><p> 通过他的诗歌和受其影响的绘画，济慈的风靡了维多利亚时代的听众。</p><p> His legacy would become more solid in the early 20th century, as museums were dedicated to his memory in London and Rome: the Keats-Shelley House in Rome in 1906 and Wentworth Place in London, which became the Keats Memorial House in 1925.</p><p> 随着博物馆致力于他在伦敦和罗马的记忆，他的遗产将在20世纪初变得更加牢固：1906年在罗马的济慈雪莱故居和1925年在伦敦成为温特沃斯纪念馆的伦敦温特沃斯广场。</p><p> When Keats’ letters to Fanny Brawne were published in 1887 they caused a sensation with their passionate content: ‘I could be martyr’d for my Religion – Love is my religion.’ The publication in 1936 of letters from Brawne to Keats’ younger sister also renewed interest in his life and poetry and ensured that later critics recognised Brawne was worthy of Keats’ love.</p><p> 1887年，济慈（Keats）给范妮·布劳（Fanny Brawne）的信发表时，他们的热情内容引起了轰动：“我可能会为我的宗教而Re道，爱是我的宗教。” 1936年，布劳恩（Brawne）给济慈的妹妹的信出版。他还对他的生活和诗歌重新产生了兴趣，并确保后来的评论家认识到布劳恩值得济慈的爱。</p><p> Since the 1930s Keats has continued to epitomise our ideal of the Romantic poet, with his beautiful verses, tragic life and early death. His writings are beloved by generations and his life continues to be scrutinised in the 21st century perhaps to a greater extent than ever before. Despite believing that he had ‘left nothing to make [his] friends proud of [his] memory’, it is ultimately owing to the work of those very friends and fans that his memory did live on. Thanks to them, on the bicentenary of his death, Keats is still read, studied and remembered.</p><p> 自1930年代以来，济慈就以其优美的诗句，悲惨的生活和早逝，继续体现了我们对浪漫主义诗人的理想。他的作品受到世世代代的喜爱，他的生活在21世纪继续受到审查，也许比以往任何时候都受到更大的关注。尽管他认为自己“没有留下任何让他的朋友为他的记忆感到骄傲的东西”，但最终归因于他的那些朋友和粉丝的辛勤工作。多亏了他们，济慈在他去世200周年之际仍被阅读，研究和记忆。 </p><p> Amy Wilcockson is a PhD researcher at the University of Nottingham and Keats-Shelley Association of America Communications Fellow 2020-21.</p><p>艾米·威尔考克森（Amy Wilcockson）是诺丁汉大学和济慈雪莱协会的美国通讯研究员2020-21年的博士研究员。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.historytoday.com/archive/history-matters/romantic-reputation-john-keats">https://www.historytoday.com/archive/history-matters/romantic-reputation-john-keats</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/名声/">#名声</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/雪莱/">#雪莱</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
