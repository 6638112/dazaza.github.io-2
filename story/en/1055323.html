Klein&#39;s words) for aphysicist consists precisely in that theabsolutised model separates from the reality and is no longer compared with it. Here is a simple example: mathematicsteaches us that the solution of the Malthus equation dx/dt = x is uniquelydefined by the initial conditions (that is that the corresponding integral curves in the (t,x)-plane do not intersect each other). This conclusionof the mathematical model bears little relevance to the reality. A computer experiment shows that all these integral curves have common points on the negative t-semi-axis. Indeed, say, curves with the initial conditions x(0) = 0 and x(0) = 1 practically intersect at t = -10 andat t = -100 you cannot fit in an atom between them. Properties of the space at such small distances are not described at all by Euclidean geometry. Application of the uniqueness theorem in this situation obviously exceeds the accuracy of the model. This has to be respected in practical application of the model,otherwise one might find oneself faced with serious troubles. I would like to note, however, that the same uniqueness theorem explains whythe closing stage of mooring of a ship to the quay is carried out manually:on steering, if the velocity of approach would have been defined as a smooth (linear) function of the distance, the process of mooring would have required an infinitely long period of time. An alternative is an impact with the quay (which is damped by suitable non-ideally elastic bodies). By theway, this problem had to be seriously confronted on landing the first descending apparata on the Moon and Mars and also on docking with space stations - here the uniqueness theorem is working against us. Unfortunately, neither such examples, nor discussing the danger of fetishising theorems are to be met in modern mathematical textbooks, even in the better ones. I even got the impression that scholastic mathematicians(who have little knowledge of physics) believe in the principal difference of theaxiomatic mathematics from modelling which is common in natural science and which always requires the subsequent control of deductions by an experiment. Not even mentioning the relative character of initial axioms, one cannotforget about the inevitability of logical mistakes in long arguments (say, in the form of a computer breakdown caused by cosmic rays or quantum oscillations). Every working mathematician knows that if one does not controloneself (best of all by examples), then after some ten pages half of all thesigns in formulae will be wrong and twos will find their wayfrom denominators into numerators. The technology of combatting such errors is the same external control by experiments or observations as in any experimental science and it should betaught from the very beginning to all juniors in schools. Attempts to create &#34;pure&#34; deductive-axiomatic mathematics have led to the rejection of the scheme used in physics (observation - model - investigation of the model - conclusions - testing by observations) and its substitution by the scheme:definition - theorem - proof. It is impossible to understand an unmotivateddefinition but this does not stop the criminal algebraists-axiomatisators. For example, they would readily define the product of natural numbers by means of the long multiplication rule.With this the commutativity of multiplication becomes difficult toprove but it is still possible to deduce it as a theorem from the axioms. It is then possible to force poor students to learn this theorem and its proof(with the aim of raising the standing of both the science and the persons teaching it). It is obvious that such definitions and such proofs can only harm the teaching and practical work. It is only possible to understand the commutativity of multiplication by counting and re-counting soldiers by ranks and files or by calculating thearea of a rectangle in the two ways. Any attempt to do without this interferenceby physics and reality into mathematics is sectarianism and isolationism whichdestroy the image of mathematics as a useful human activity in the eyes of all sensible people. I shall open a few more such secrets (in the interest of poor students). The  determinant of a matrix is an (oriented) volume of the parallelepiped whose edges are its columns. If the students are told thissecret (which is carefully hidden in the purified algebraic education),then the whole theory of determinants becomes a clear chapter of the theory of poly-linear forms. If determinants are defined otherwise, thenany sensible person will forever hate all the determinants, Jacobians and theimplicit function theorem. What is a  group? Algebraists teach that this is supposedly a set withtwo operations that satisfy a load of easily-forgettable axioms. This definition provokes a natural protest: why would any sensible person need suchpairs of operations? &#34;Oh, curse this maths&#34; - concludes the student (who, possibly, becomes the Minister for Science in the future). We get a totally different situation if we start off not with the group but with the concept of a transformation (a one-to-one mapping of a setonto itself)as it was historically. A collection of transformations of a set is called a group if along with any two transformations it contains the resultof their consecutive application and an inverse transformation along with every transformation. This is all the definition there is. The so-called &#34;axioms&#34; are in factjust (obvious)  properties of groups of transformations. What axiomatisatorscall &#34;abstract groups&#34; are just groups of transformations of various setsconsidered up to isomorphisms (which are one-to-one mappings preserving the operations). As Cayley proved, there are no &#34;more abstract&#34;groups in the world. So why do the algebraists keep on tormenting students with the abstract definition? By the way, in the 1960s I taught group theory to Moscow  schoolchildren. Avoiding all the axiomatics and staying as close as possible to physics, in half a year I got to the Abel theorem on the unsolvability of a general equation of degree five in radicals (havingon the way taught the pupils complex numbers, Riemann surfaces, fundamentalgroups and monodromy groups of algebraic functions). This course was laterpublished by one of the audience, V. Alekseev, as the book The Abel theorem in problems. What is a  smooth manifold? In a recent American book I read thatPoincaré was not acquainted with this (introduced by himself) notion and thatthe &#34;modern&#34; definition was only given by Veblen in the late 1920s: a manifold is a topological space which satisfies a long series of axioms. For what sins must students try and find their way through all these twistsand turns? Actually, in Poincaré&#39;s  Analysis Situs there is an absolutelyclear definition of a smooth manifold which is much more useful than the &#34;abstract&#34; one. A smooth k-dimensional submanifold of the Euclidean space R N is itssubset which in a neighbourhood of its every point is a graph of a smoothmapping of  R k into  R (N - k) (where  R k and  R (N - k) are coordinatesubspaces). This is a straightforward generalization of most common smoothcurves on the plane (say, of the circle x 2 + y 2 = 1) or curves and surfaces in the three-dimensional space. Between smooth manifolds smooth mappings are naturally defined. Diffeomorphisms are mappings which are smooth, together with their inverses. An &#34;abstract&#34; smooth manifold is a smooth submanifold of a Euclidean spaceconsidered up to a diffeomorphism. There are no &#34;more abstract&#34; finite-dimensional smooth manifolds in the world (Whitney&#39;s theorem). Why do we keep on tormenting students with the abstract definition? Would it not be better to prove themthe theorem about the explicit classification of closed two-dimensional manifolds (surfaces)? It is this wonderful theorem (which states, for example, that any compact connected oriented surface is a sphere with a number of handles) that gives a correct impression of what modern mathematics is and not the super-abstract generalizations of naive submanifolds of a Euclidean space which in fact do not give anything new and are presented as achievements by theaxiomatisators. The theorem of classification of surfaces is a top-class mathematical achievement, comparable with the discovery of America or X-rays. This is agenuine discovery of mathematical natural science and it is even difficult to saywhether the fact itself is more attributable to physics or to mathematics. Inits significance for both the applications and the development of correctWeltanschauung it by far surpasses such &#34;achievements&#34; ofmathematics as the proof of Fermat&#39;s last theorem or the proof of the fact that any sufficiently large whole number can be represented as a sum of threeprime numbers.  For the sake of publicity modern mathematicians sometimes present such sporting achievements as the last word in their science. Understandably this not only does not contribute to the society&#39;s appreciation of mathematics but, on thecontrary, causes a healthy distrust of the necessity of wasting energy on (rock-climbing-type) exercises with these exotic questions needed and wanted by no one. The theorem of classification of surfaces should have been included in highschool mathematics courses (probably, without the proof) but for some reasonis not included even in university mathematics courses (from which in France,by the way, all the geometry has been banished over the last few decades). The return of mathematical teaching at all levels from the scholastic chatter to presenting the important domain ofnatural science is an espessially hot problem for France. I was astonished that all the best and most important in methodical approach mathematical books are almost unknown to students here(and, seems to me, have not been translated into French). Among these are  Numbers and figures by Rademacher and Töplitz,  Geometry and the imagination by Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen,  What is mathematics? by Courant and Robbins,  How to solve itand  Mathematicsand plausible reasoning by Polya,  Development ofmathematics in the 19th century by F. Klein. I remember well what a strong impression the calculus course by Hermite(which does exist in a Russian translation!) made on me in my school years. Riemann surfaces appeared in it, I think, in one of the first lectures (allthe analysis was, of course, complex, as it should be). Asymptotics of integrals were investigated by means of path deformations on Riemannsurfaces under the motion of branching points (nowadays, we would have calledthis the Picard-Lefschetz theory; Picard, by the way, was Hermite&#39;sson-in-law - mathematical abilities are often transferred by sons-in-law: the dynasty Hadamard - P. Levy - L. Schwarz - U. Frisch isyet another famous example in the Paris Academy of Sciences). The &#34;obsolete&#34; course by Hermite of one hundred years ago (probably, nowthrown away from student libraries of French universities) was much more modern than those most boring calculus textbooks with which students are nowadays tormented. If mathematicians do not come to their senses, then the consumers who preserved a need in a modern, in the best meaning of the word, mathematical theory as wellas the immunity (characteristic of anysensible person) to the useless axiomatic chatter will in the end turn down the services of the undereducated scholasticsin both the schools and the universities. A teacher of mathematics, who has not got to grips with at least some of the volumes of the course by Landau and Lifshitz, will then become a relict like the one nowadays who does not know the difference between an open and a closed set.
