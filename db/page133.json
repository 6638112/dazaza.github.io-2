G \n...... ", "note_en": "I am often asked in emails how to go about learning the necessary mathematics for getting a job in quantitative finance or data science if it isn&#39;t possible to head to university. This article is a response to such emails. I want to discuss how you can become a mathematical  autodidact using nothing but a range of relatively reasonably priced textbooks and resources on the internet. While it is far from easy to sustain the necessary effort to achieve such a task outside of a formal setting, it is possible with the resources (both paid and free) that are now available.\n  We&#39;ll begin by discussing the reasons for wanting to learn advanced mathematics, be it career-driven, to gain entrance into formal education or even as a hobby. We&#39;ll then outline the time commitment required for each stage of the process, from junior highschool (UK GCSE equivalent) through to postgraduate/research level work. I will then present the different study materials available for the equivalent of an undergraduate course, how to access them and how to make the best use of them. Finally, I will describe a mathematical syllabus that takes you all the way through a modern four-year Masters-level UK-style undergraduate course in mathematics, as applicable mainly to quantitative finance, data science or scientific software development.\n  In this particular article we will consider the first year of an undergraduate course. The remaining articles will each discuss subsequent years.\n    The first question to ask yourself is why you want to learn mathematics in the first place. It is an extremely serious undertaking and requires substantial long-term commitment over a number of years, so it is absolutely imperative that there is a strong underlying motivation, otherwise it is unlikely that you will stick with self-study over the long term.\n  For the majority of you on this site, it is because you wish to gain employment and/or further formal study in the field of quantitative finance, data science or scientific software development.\n  You might be an individual at the beginning of your educational career, deciding whether to take a formal university program in mathematics. You might have worked in a technical industry for 10-15 years, but seek a new role and wish to understand the necessary prerequisite material for the career change. You might also enjoy studying in your own time but lack a structured approach and want a reasonably linear path to follow.\n  One of the primary reasons for wanting to learn advanced mathematics is to become a &#34;quant&#34;. However, if your sole reason for wanting to learn these topics is to get a job in the sector, particularly in an investment bank or quantitative hedge fund, I would strongly advise you to carry out mathematics in a formal setting (i.e. at university). This is not because self-study will be any less valuable or teach you less than in a formal setting, but because the  credential from a  top university is, unfortunately, what often counts in getting interviews, at least for those early in their career.\n  An alternative reason for learning mathematics is because you wish to gain a deeper understanding of how the universe works. Mathematics is ultimately about formalising systems and understanding space, shape and structure. It is the &#34;language of nature&#34; and is utilised heavily in all of the quantitative sciences. It is also fascinating in its own right. If you are heavily interested in learning more about deeper areas of mathematics, but lack the ability to carry it out in a formal setting, this article series will help you gain the necessary mathematical maturity, if you are willing to put in the effort.\n    I want to emphasise that studying mathematics from the level of a junior highschooler to postgraduate level (if desired) will require a huge commitment in time, likely on the order of 10-15  years. Clearly this is a staggering commitment to undertake and, without a strong study-plan, will likely not be completed due to the simple fact that &#34;life often gets in the way&#34;.\n  However, chances are if you are considering studying advanced mathematics you will already have formal qualifications in the basics, particularly the mathematics learnt in junior and senior highschool (GCSE and A-Level for those of us in the UK!). In this instance it is likely that you might be able to begin learning at the start of the undergraduate level, or possibly at the level of an advanced highschool student.\n  Even if you have the equivalent qualifications in A-Level Mathematics or A-Level Further Mathematics, you will still have a long road ahead of you. I estimate that it will take approximately 3-4 years of full-time study or 6-8 years of part-time study, in order to have an equivalent knowledge base gained by an individual who has carried out formal study in a UK undergraduate mathematics program to masters level.\n  While I don&#39;t think it is necessary to have postgraduate qualifications to become a quant, it is useful and can certainly put you ahead of the competition. However, do not be put off by the time commitment for postgraduate study. It isn&#39;t absolutely necessary and is likely to be carried out in a formal, full-time setting regardless.\n  If you are happy with this overall level of commitment, then the broad path that you will follow should look something like this:\n    As you can see, a mathematics education to a high level can take anywhere from 3 years to approximately 15 years (or more!) depending on your chosen path. Hence this is not something to be undertaken lightly. You must give it serious consideration and make sure that the payoff (financial or otherwise) from study will be worth the serious effort required.\n    These days it is possible to study from a mixture of freely available video lectures, lecture notes and textbooks. There are those who learn better from watching videos and making notes, while others enjoy working methodically through a textbook. I&#39;ve listed what I consider to be the most useful resources below.\n    At the undergraduate level, I am a big fan of the  Springer Undergraduate Mathematics Series of textbooks, which cover pretty much every major course you will find on a  top-tier mathematics undergraduate degree in the UK. I will go into detail regarding choices of books for specific modules below.\n  I&#39;ve also found the  Schaum&#39;s Outlines series of books to be extremely helpful, particularly for those who like to learn by answering questions. While they don&#39;t go into the detail that others might (particularly the SUMS books above), they do help consolidate the basics by working through a lot of questions. I highly recommend them if you&#39;ve not seen any of the material before.\n    Many Universities provide publicly accessible course pages that contain freely available lecture notes, often in PDF format, typeset in LaTeX or similar. Where appropriate, I&#39;ve listed freely available lecture notes for particular courses. However, I prefer to recommend textbooks as they tend to cover a wider set of material. They aren&#39;t &#34;cherry picking&#34; material in a way that a lecturer will have to do so in order to fit the material into semester-length courses. Despite this issue, there are some extremely good lecture notes available online.\n    The rise of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) has fundamentally changed the way students now interact with lecturers, whether they are enrolled on a particular course or not. Leaders in the field include  MIT Open Courseware,  Coursera and  Udacity. Some MOOCs are free, while others charge. On the whole, I&#39;ve found MOOCs to be a great mechanism for learning as they are similar to how students learn at University, in a lecture setting.\n  They provide the added benefits of being able to pause videos, rewind them, interaction with lecturers on online portals as well as easy access to supplementary materials. Some have suggested that the quality of MOOCs is not as good as that which can be found in a University setting, but I disagree with this. On the whole, most MOOCs are actually  lectures filmed in University settings, so I feel this point is somewhat moot.\n  There are some extremely good MOOCs available in data science, machine learning and quantitative finance. However, I have found there to be a lack of more fundamental courses and as such you&#39;ll see me recommending textbooks for the majority of the courses listed here. As the focus turns to quantiative finance (in Year 3 and 4, as well as at the MFE level), I will be able to recommend more MOOCs in addition to traditional textbooks.\n    At this stage of your mathematical career you will be familiar with the basics of differential and integral calculus, trigonometric identities, perhaps some elementary linear algebra and possibly some elementary group theory, gained from highschool or through self-study.\n  However, there is a substantial shift in mindset when moving from A-Level/highschool mathematics to that studied in a typical UK undergraduate program. The methods for teaching mathematics at highschool level are largely mechanical in nature and do not require a deep level of thinking. At University, mathematics becomes largely about formal systems of axioms and an emphasis on formal proofs.\n  This means that ones thinking is shifted from mechanical solution of problems, utilising a &#34;toolbox&#34; of techniques, towards deep thought about disparate areas of mathematics that can be linked in order to prove results. It is the fundamental difference between highschool mathematics and undergraduate mathematics.\n  In fact, it is this particular mode of thinking that makes mathematics such a highly sought after degree in the quantitative finance world.\n  Self-study of university level mathematics is not an easy task, by any means. It requires a substantial level of discipline and effort to not only make the cognitive shift into &#34;theorem and proof&#34; mathematics, but also to do this as a full autodidact.\n  For those of you who are unable or unwilling to carry out formal study in a university setting and wish to tackle a full syllabus of undergraduate mathematics, I have created a comprehensive study plan below to take you from high school level mathematics to the equivalent of a four-year Masters in Mathematics undergraduate course. I have presented it in a year-by-year, module-by-module format with plenty of further reference materials to study at your own pace.\n  Since a degree course is often tailored to the desires of the individual in the latter two years, I have created a syllabus which broadly reflects the topics that a prospective quant should know. However, you can obviously add your own choices for your own particular situation. To this end, I have made suggestions where appropriate.\n  This article will concentrate on Year 1 of a degree program, with subsequent articles each covering an entire year.\n    The first year in an undergraduate mathematics education is primarily about shifting your mindset from the &#34;mechanical&#34; approach taught at highschool/A-Level into the &#34;formal systems&#34; approach that is studied at university. Hence, there is a much more rigourous emphasis on  mathematical foundations, including formal descriptions of  sets,  maps/functions,  continuity and  symmetry, as well as  theorems and  proofs.\n  The courses found in a first year largely reflect this transition, whereby the following core topics are emphasised:\n          Most  top-tier UK undergraduate courses have a &#34;Foundations&#34; module of some description. The goal of the course is to provide you with a detailed overview of the nature of university mathematics, including the notions of proof (such as  proof by induction and  proof by contradiction), the concept of a  map or  function, as well as the differing types such as the  injection,  surjection and  bijection.\n  In addition to these topics, the concept of a  set is formally outlined, as well as the induced structure on such sets by  operations, leading to the concept of  groups. These core topics and ideas will prepare you for the deeper topics of analysis, linear algebra and differential equations that form the remainder of a first year undergraduate syllabus.\n  Self-study of mathematical foundations can be challenging, as it is often the first time you will have seen the concept of a proof. It can be bewildering at the beginning to understand how proofs can be constructed, but as with everything else in life, it is possible to learn how to structure proofs through a lot of reading and practice.\n  Perhaps the best way to learn mathematical foundations is through &#34;bedside reading&#34;, or perhaps more rigourous study, of some of the better known textbooks. I myself learnt from the following two books listed under  Study Materials below. I can highly recommend them as they certainly provide a good taste as to what university mathematics is all about.\n        Real Analysis is a staple course in first year undergraduate mathematics. It is an extremely important topic, especially for quants, as it forms the basis for later courses in stochastic calculus and partial differential equations. The subject is primarily about  real numbers and functions between sets of real numbers. The main topics discussed include  sequences,  series,  convergence,  limits,  calculus and  continuity.\n  The primary benefit of studying real analysis is that it provides a gentle introduction to proofs, using examples that aren&#39;t too unfamiliar from A-Level (highschool equivalent) mathematics. In this way, real analysis courses teach not only the &#34;mindset&#34; of forming proofs, but also introduce more abstract concepts such as &#34;proper&#34; definitions of  infinity,  axioms (such as the  axiom of completeness) and some good experience manipulating  continuous functions and their  derivatives.\n  In order to learn Real Analysis by yourself, I would suggest taking a look at the textbook  Numbers and Functions: Steps into Analysis \r listed below. I used this to learn Real Analysis when I was at university and I found it extremely helpful. The book teaches you by getting you to carry out a large number of questions, rather than throwing a huge amount of text at you. In this way you  learn by doing. In addition to that book, I have listed a few others that are helpful. Finally, I&#39;ve listed a  YouTube playlist series from Harvey Mudd College, by Professor Francis Su. The video quality is not great, but the content is extremely good.\n        Linear Algebra is one of the most important, if not the most important, subjects to learn for a prospective quant or data scientist.\n  In an abstract sense Linear Algebra is about the study of  linear maps between  vector spaces. It teaches us that in certain cases linear maps and  matrices are actually equivalent. This latter result makes it extremely useful when dealing with matrix equations, of which there are many within quantitative finance and data science.\n  The majority of  statistical machine learning methods are based on the principles of linear algebra and calculus, as are many quantitative finance theories, such as the  covariance matrix and the  capital asset pricing model. Hence, it is imperative for prospective quants to learn it well.\n  Thankfully, Linear Algebra has such a wide applicability in mathematics, physics, engineering and science in general, that there are many great resources available for learning it. One of the best books to learn about it is by  Gilbert Strang, a professor at MIT. In addition to his textbook, you can also find a set of video lectures presented by him on MIT Open Courseware.\n        The subject of differential equations permeates wide areas of quantitative finance. They are an extremely important subject for a prospective quant to learn, as stochastic differential equations play a large part in options pricing theory.\n  Formally, a differential equation is a relationship between a function and its derivatives. Informally, they are equations, which describe how rates of change of the function, with respect to some other quantity, affect the function itself.\n  Ordinary differential equations (ODE) are the first type considered at university (as well as A-Level/Highschool). An ODE is a differential equation where the underlying function has one independent variable. For instance, an ODE could represent the  rate of change of population growth as a function of the population level itself.\n  As a quant, it is necessary to understand the basics of ODEs and how to solve them. Since the more complicated partial differential equations (PDE) and stochastic differential, equations (SDE) are widely found in quantitative analysis and trading, understanding the solution of the more simpler ODEs helps with understanding solutions of these problems.\n  Some ODEs can be solved  analytically, that is, with a closed-form solution, using elementary functions. However, the solution to many ODEs can only be written as a series or integral relationship. ODEs can be solved &#34;numerically&#34;, on the computer, using approximate methods. A large part of quantitative finance involves numerically solving differential equations in this manner.\n  There is no lack of study materials available for ODEs as they are a staple of the first year undergraduate mathematics program. I used the book written by my lecturer at University, and I found it to be approachable for a first year undergraduate (see Robinson, below). In addition, there is the famous &#34;Boyce &amp; DiPrima&#34; (now in its 10th edition!), which is the staple of many ODE courses. In addition there is a free video lecture series on MIT Open CourseWare:\n    Textbook/~$150 (although you&#39;ll get it much cheaper second-hand) -  Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems  by William Boyce and Richard DiPrima\n    Geometry is one of the most fundamental areas of mathematics. It is absolutely essential for many areas of deeper mathematics, including those related to quantitative finance. Many undergraduate courses introduce Euclidean geometry to students in their first year, and it is also an appropriate place to start for the autodidact.\n  The primary setting is often Euclidean Geometry in three-dimensions, namely the geometry of &#34;everyday life&#34;. You will learn a lot about constructing proofs from studying geometry, particularly with regards to projective geometry in the plane and geometry of the sphere.\n  In highschool (or at GCSE!) students are often taught about triangular geometry, and an introductory university module in Geometry will formalise these concepts, ultimately with the idea of gaining practice understanding and writing geometric proofs.\n  Euclidean Geometry eventually leads on to more general geometries such as Spherical Geometry or Hyperbolic Geometry, where familiar results from Euclidean Geometry are shown not to hold. In addition, and perhaps more relevant to the quant, having a good understanding of trigonometry is essential for later courses such as Fourier Analysis, which plays a substantial role in signals analysis and time series analysis.\n    Geometry is a tricky subject to introduce as it is extremely broad and covers such a diverse area of mathematics. However, I have found the following book, part of the Springer Undergraduate Mathematics Series, to be very helpful:\n      Groups are one of the most important algebraic structures found in mathematics. They provide the basis for studying more complex structures such as rings, fields, vector spaces (which we mentioned above in Linear Algebra). They are also strongly related to the idea of mathematical symmetry.\n  While it might be considered that groups are more of a &#34;pure mathematics&#34; topic, and thus are less applied, this is actually not the case.

Life was rich until I tried to quit. This is the story of why I had to pay $300K to unshackle myself.\u00a0  There\u2019s surprisingly little coverage on this topic, maybe because nobody is incentivized to reveal the unsavory truth, or because VCs and founders get a lot more airtime.  Here\u2019s everything I wish I knew before I joined a startup. I hope it can save you from burning piles of money like I did.\u00a0 \u200d\n  For all the talk around \u201cdisruption\u201d, startups exert a surprising inertia over employees.   \u201cGolden handcuffs\u201d is most often used to describe the inertia experienced by big tech employees who make a ton of money and have a hard time leaving. It also applies to startup employees who make a ton of  paper gains and have a hard time coming up with  real money to keep them.\u00a0 \u200d\n  Working at a startup generally requires taking a salary cut. The deal is sweetened with equity \u2014 an ownership stake that can mint millions.   The most common equity vehicle is the stock option. It\u2019s the  option to  buy a certain # of shares at a set price, aka the strike price. That\u2019s right.  You don\u2019t own shares of the company, you own the right to  buy them.    There are two more catches:\n Options usually expire within 90 days of your leaving \u2014 so you have to either pay up or give them up\n If you pay up, you also owe taxes on your  paper gains \u2014 the difference between your strike price and the current valuation\n #2 is dangerous because your taxes grow with the valuation. Even if you have a cheap strike price, your tax burden can be multiples higher. In fact, your total bill can end up costing more than the startup has ever paid you in cash! Yes, it is actually possible to be net negative after devoting years of your life as an employee.   In my case, the price tag for my vested shares was $100K, but the tax bill will be another $200K. That\u2019s a ton of cash just to  keep the shares I worked for, with no guarantees that they will be worth real money.  \u200d\n  The financial defaults are terrible for startup employees, but they don\u2019t need to be this way. You can and should negotiate the fine print, where all the devils lie. Exceptions are never granted unless you ask. Especially true if you are a strong hire and/or the startup really needs to fill the position (which is more common than you think).   First order of business is the exercise window.  Instead of taking the punishing 90 day window, ask for 10 years. You can frame it like this: \u201cI believe in the potential of X and I\u2019m excited to take part in the upside. It\u2019s important that I can do that regardless of my cash position at a specific moment in time.\u201d  Best time to ask is before you sign the offer. This is when you have peak leverage, and if you make it the final sticking point, you\u2019re more likely to get it. To gain an upper hand, try to secure competing offers that have more favorable terms.\u00a0  Does negotiating make you look petty? No, if anything, it shows you\u2019ve done your homework.  Not negotiating terrible terms betrays your naivete \u2014 like me when I signed my offer.  Whatever you settle on, make sure to get it in writing. Many a verbal promise is broken when there\u2019s large sums of money at stake.   If you still wind up with a crazy bill, see if the next company you join is willing to pay your switching cost. I forgot to do this when  negotiating with Instagram, but it can work, especially with bigger companies. The downside is that if you need the new company to bail you out of your old one, you are at their mercy.\u00a0  More points you can negotiate for:\n RSUs instead of stock options: restricted stock units have a strike price of $0, but early-stage startups may not offer this\n Even if you don\u2019t get everything you want, you\u2019ll still develop a better understanding of how accessible your equity  really is. Sometimes a higher salary is better than heaps of \u201clife-changing\u201d stock options you can never afford.  One more escape valve that just came to my attention:  83b election. If you believe in the growth potential of your shares AND you expect to stay and vest, you can choose to pay taxes on your full grant upfront, rather than on your paper gains down the line. This may save you a lot on taxes, but also comes with a dose of downsides:\n You can end up worse off if the shares decline in value OR you don\u2019t fully vest  \u200d\n  As much as startups talk about growing the pie, the finite pool of shares is treated as zero sum. There are only ever 100 points on a cap table. When you give up your options, they go back into the company pool. Your unused options can then be recycled to fund new employee packages.\u00a0\u00a0  Here&#39;s how a VC  sums it up: extending the exercise window prioritizes the well-being of former employees over existing ones. What startup in its right mind would do that?! Probably one that recognizes it was built, brick by brick, from the hands of early employees. Sadly,  91.4% do not recognize this.\u00a0  It\u2019s also hard to decipher the terms in your offer package. If every startup had to walk employees through how the numbers play out, a lot of offers would go unsigned because they\u2019re absurd. Instead, we&#39;re sold on the opportunity to \u201cmake a dent in the universe\u201d.   It\u2019s rarely about the money until the money becomes real.\u00a0 \u200d\n  Most people advised me to give up some shares, or find a third-party to front the cash and split the upside \u2014 both more rational choices than the one I took.\u00a0  In the end, watching years of hard work evaporate in 90 days far exceeded the pain of just paying for the damn lottery ticket. I\u2019m lucky I had access to that cash. Many people don\u2019t. They are forced to give up their shares or stay shackled to a company in hopes of liquidity some day.  I never joined a startup to get rich. But I did naively assume that if all went well, I would ride off into the sunset, having paid for the equity in sweat. I didn\u2019t comb through the fine print because I didn\u2019t know any better.\u00a0  Now you do! Maybe I should rebrand my $300K bill as a premium MBA \u2014 it\u2019s sure taught me a lot, and I hope it brings you a wealth of lessons too.  \u200d\n   I still believe the  right startup offers endless amounts of learning, and a serious shot at earning. But the pot of gold at the end of Unicorn Road is littered with hidden minefields.

I figured it would be a great read but at the same time, it&#39;s a useful exercise for me to see if there are any services we can get rid of or downgrade.\n Just to give you an idea of scale Prezly is an 18 person SaaS product. Fully bootstrapped (no outside capital) and serving about 500 customers globally.\n   If you break that down by the number of staff we&#39;re looking at a cost of 1250 \u20ac/month but this includes the server cost. Excluding server costs, the tooling per staff member (excluding hardware) is around  712  \u20ac/month\n  We&#39;re a software company so obviously, this is the main cost (outside of salaries). These are the minimal infrastructure we need to run the app.\n  Without any of those tools customers would start complaining. Only AWS, Sendgrid, Uploadcare and Algolia are mission-critical.

Carl Vinson aircraft carrier group, Carrier Strike Group One, in response to a massive build-up of Russian naval forces currently operating roughly 300 miles west of Hawaii.\n Multiple U.S. Defense officials speaking on background told\u00a0  The Debrief  that sailors assigned to the Carl Vinson Carrier Group found out at the end of May they would be leaving for an unscheduled deployment within the next 11 days. Reportedly, the carrier group had been previously scheduled to deploy at the end of the summer.\n Officials say the reason for the rapid deployment was large-scale movements by Russian naval forces seen heading towards the vicinity of Hawaii.\n \u201cDeployment cycles are typically very routine, highly coordinated, and scheduled well in advance,\u201d said one current Navy official who was not cleared to speak on the record. \u201cTo pull ahead of a previously scheduled deployment for a classified mission set is extremely rare.\u201d\n So far, the Navy and Department of Defense have not acknowledged the Carl Vinson Carrier Group\u2019s sudden quiet deployment. Instead, on June 17, U.S. Pacific Command released an\u00a0  article \u00a0simply announcing the group was currently in the Hawaiian Islands Operating Area. Framing its sudden appearance as \u201cintegrated training operations with the U.S. Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard.\u201d\n \u201cOperating in Hawaii provides unique opportunities for Vinson to train jointly while positioned to respond if called,\u201d Commander of the U.S. 3rd Fleet, Vice Adm. Steve Koehler, said cryptically, while avoiding mention of there being any real-world element to the group\u2019s activities. \u201cThey train to a variety of missions, from long-range strikes to anti-submarine warfare, and can move anywhere on the globe on short notice.\u201d\n   On June 13, Russian state-run media\u00a0  announced \u00a0Russia\u2019s Pacific Fleet would be conducting large-scale naval drills in the Pacific Ocean.\n According to Russian news outlet\u00a0  TASS , exercises include all of Russia\u2019s \u201cPrimorye Flotilla\u201d (Pacific Fleet), auxiliary vessels, and up to 20 aircraft, including long-range bombers. \u201cThe drills involve up to 20 surface combatants, submarines, and support vessels,\u201d specified the Russian Defense Ministry.\n CBS News   reports \u00a0that Russian officials call the maneuvers the \u201clargest exercise in the Pacific Ocean since the end of the Cold War.\u201d\n On Sunday, June 13, Three F-22 Raptors and a KC-135 refueling tanker were\u00a0  scrambled  from Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii. Initially, Air Force officials only said the scramble was an \u201cirregular patrol\u201d in response to a request by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA released a short message about the incident through Public Affairs spokesperson Ian Gregor, saying only, \u201cThe F.A.A. has a close working relationship with the military.\u201d\n Citing U.S. defense officials, CBS News   reports \u00a0the scrambling of the three stealth fighters and refueling aircraft were in response to Russian bombers that were picked up flying in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands. Reportedly, Russian bombers never entered the U.S.\u2019s Air Defense Identification Zone, and the F-22s did not intercept the aircraft.\n On May 26, several news outlets\u00a0  revealed \u00a0that a Russian Navy surveillance ship was seen lingering off the western coast of Hawaii. Believed to be the Vishnya-class signals intelligence ship the Kareliya (SSV-535), the spy vessel was reportedly set up 13 miles from the Hawaiian island of Kauai, roughly one nautical mile outside U.S. territorial waters.\n From its vantage point, the Russian spy vessel had a front-row seat to a failed air defense test by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency near Hawaii on May 27. According to reports, a pair of Standard Missile 6 Dual II (SM-6) air defense missiles failed to intercept a simulated ballistic missile attack during the test.\n Popular Mechanics Defense reporter, Kyle Mizokami,\u00a0  theorized \u00a0Russia might have been tipped off about the classified missile tests from Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and Notice to Mariners (NOMAR/HYDROPAC) warning aircraft or ships to avoid the area.\n Conversely, observation of the failed missile test may have been simply a bonus. The Kareliya- which specializes in intercepting and deciphering an adversary\u2019s transmissions \u2013 may have actually been trying to measure the U.S.\u2019s response to Russia\u2019s Pacific Fleet, which was currently heading towards the area.\n On Tuesday, CBS News   reported  that the U.S.S. Carl Vinson Carrier Group was \u201coperating about 200 miles east of Hawaii, conducting a strike group certification exercise.\u201d According to CBS, the certification exercise had been pre-planned but was moved closer to Hawaii in response to Russia\u2019s presence.\n Multiple defense officials tell\u00a0  The Debrief\u00a0 that planned exercises or deployment for the Carl Vinson Carrier Group had been previously scheduled for around September. These same officials said that in the last week of May, sailors were notified that plans to go underway had been moved up from months away to less than two weeks.\n   Defense officials tell\u00a0  The Debrief \u00a0that sailors assigned to Carrier Strike Group One reported to their ships on June 6. Live\u00a0  web cameras \u00a0of San Diego Harbor show the U.S.S. Carl Vinson left port around 10:30 am local time on June 7. Absent from its departure appears to be the usual fanfare. Namely \u201cmanning the rail\u201d or having the crew \u201cat quarters,\u201d with sailors lining up at regular intervals along the weather deck rails in ceremony as the ship enters or leaves port.\n Navy public affairs offices have declined to confirm, deny, or comment on the aircraft carrier group\u2019s deployment so far. After beginning with Naval Air Forces Command on June 10,  The Debrief\u2019s request made it up to 3rd Fleet Command\u2019s public affairs office on June 15.\n Instead of replying to media requests, on June 17, U.S. Pacific Fleet Command released a\u00a0  short article \u00a0and two images saying Carrier Strike Group One had arrived in the Hawaiian Islands Operating Area.\n Rather than acknowledging the atypical nature of the carrier group\u2019s arrival near Hawaii, Pacific Fleet Command\u2019s article seemed to be a veiled notice to Russian forces operating nearby that the U.S. Navy was prepared to respond to any aggression towards U.S. interests in the Pacific.\n The Navy mentioned that along with its flagship, the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Carl Vinson, the entire Carrier Strike Group One, which includes  \u2014 Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 2, Destroyer Squadron 1, the guided-missile destroyers U.S.S. O\u2019Kane (D.D.G. 77), U.S.S. Howard (D.D.G. 83), U.S.S. Chafee (D.D.G. 90), U.S.S. Dewey (DDG 105) and U.S.S. Michael Murphy (D.D.G. 11  \u2014 was all operating near Hawaii.\n   The Navy also reminded anyone who wasn\u2019t aware or had forgotten, the U.S.S. Carl Vinson is the first aircraft carrier equipped to support F-35C Lightning II and CMV-22B Osprey aircraft. Pointing out, the group also brought with it three U.S. Navy F/A-18 Strike Fighter Squadrons, and EA-18G Growler Electronic Attack Squadron, and E-2D Hawkeye Airborne Command &amp; Control Squadron, Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron, and Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron.\n \u201cWith its recent modifications, no other weapons platform has the responsiveness, endurance, multi-dimensional capacity, inherent battlespace awareness or command and control capabilities of CSG-1,\u201d reads the release by Pacific Fleet Command.\n CSG-1 isn\u2019t the only U.S. naval force that rapidly deployed to the Pacific in early June.\n As part of a training drill dubbed\u00a0  Exercise Agile Dagger , one-third of the Pacific Submarine Force deployed from Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam on June 3.\u00a0  According \u00a0to the Navy, submarines from Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; Bremerton, Washington; and San Diego, California; are participating in Exercise Agile Dagger to \u201cdeploy on short notice to demonstrate their readiness, agility, and lethality.\u201d\n There have been evident tensions between the United States and Russia in recent months. Russia has been accused of committing numerous cyber attacks against the U.S., and several months ago, Russia amassed 100,000 troops on the border with Western-allied Ukraine.\n However, there are no indications that any discussions regarding naval maneuvers in the Pacific came up during a meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin in Geneva on June 17.\n In a\u00a0  statement to CBS News , U.S. Indo-Pacific Command spokesperson, Captain Mike Kafka said, \u201cU.S. Indo-Pacific Command is monitoring the Russian vessels operating in international waters in the Western Pacific.\u201d\n Ultimately, why the Navy and DoD are so cagey about the Carl Vinson Carrier Group\u2019s sudden deployment or what is going on in the Pacific isn\u2019t entirely clear. It is, however, doubtful that things would ever escalate to the U.S. and Russia coming to blows.\n Nevertheless, with so many American and Russian naval forces currently operating in the vicinity of Hawaii, one defense official told\u00a0  The Debrief , \u201cThings could get pretty tense.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-19 08:21:47", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af,\u96c6\u56e2,quietly,\u7f8e\u56fd", "title": "\u6d77\u519b\u9759\u9759\u5730\u8fc5\u901f\u90e8\u7f72\u4e86\u6574\u4e2a\u822a\u7a7a\u6bcd\u8230\u96c6\u56e2\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u590f\u5a01\u5937\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u8239 - \u6c47\u62a5 ", "title_en": "The Navy Quietly Just Rapidly Deployed an Entire Aircraft Carrier Group To Meet Russian Ships Near Hawaii - The Debrief", "transed": 1, "url": "https://thedebrief.org/the-navy-quietly-just-rapidly-deployed-an-entire-aircraft-carrier-group-to-meet-russian-ships-near-hawaii/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af", "\u96c6\u56e2", "quietly", "\u7f8e\u56fd"]}]
