But the pair had something else in mind. “Do you want to have some fun?” he recalled one of them saying. “Whoa, no thank you!” he responded, and drove off, laughing to himself. It was like something he’d seen only on TV.</p><p>  他认为他们可能需要帮助，于是他停了下来，打开窗户。但是他们俩还有其他想法。 “你想找点乐子吗？”他回想起其中一位说的话。 “哇，不，谢谢！”他回应，开车离开，对自己开怀大笑。就像他只在电视上看到的一样。</p><p>  The 21-year-old, who is Black, made it a few blocks before police yanked him out of his car and began to search him. Terrified and unsure of what was happening, he insisted they had the wrong guy. Officers yelled at him to “shut the fuck up.”</p><p>  这位21岁的黑人是布莱克（Black），在警察将他从车上拉下并开始搜查他之前，经过了几个街区。他坚持认为他们选错了人，对此感到恐惧和不确定。军官对他大喊“闭嘴”。</p><p>  The women were undercover police officers. He was under arrest for patronizing a prostitute. The police put him in a van, where he sat handcuffed for hours as it filled with other Black and brown men.</p><p>  这些妇女是秘密警察。他因光顾妓女而被捕。警察把他放在一辆面包车里，他坐上几个小时，手铐里坐满了其他黑人和棕色男人。</p><p>  It was one of the New York Police Department’s biggest stings since Mayor Bill de Blasio took office in 2014, the direct outcome of a strategy he and top cops have touted in recent years to combat human trafficking: Officers should arrest “the true criminals” like “johns” and “pimps,” while making sure people forced into prostitution get the help they need to get out.</p><p>  这是自2014年市长比尔·德·布拉西奥（Bill de Blasio）上任以来纽约警察局遭受的最大打击之一，这是他和高级警察近年来吹捧的打击人口贩运战略的直接结果：警官应逮捕“真正的罪犯”，例如“约翰”和“皮条客”，同时确保被迫卖淫的人得到他们需要的帮助。</p><p>    On the ground, the reality has been different from the rhetoric. Teams of NYPD officers have descended on minority neighborhoods, leaning into car windows and knocking on apartment doors, trying to get men and women to say the magic words: agreeing to exchange sex for money. These arrests are based almost entirely on the word of cops, who say they are incentivized to round up as many “bodies” as they can.</p><p>    在地面上，现实与言辞有所不同。纽约警察局的工作人员走到少数居民区，斜倚在车窗上，敲敲公寓的门，试图让男人和女人说出神奇的话：同意以性换钱。这些逮捕行动几乎完全基于警察的话，他们说，他们被鼓励尽可能多地聚集“机构”。 </p><p>  Some of their targets were selling sex to survive; others were minding their own business. Almost everyone arrested for these crimes in the last four years is nonwhite, a ProPublica data analysis shows: 89% of the 1,800 charged with prostitution; 93% of the 3,000 accused of trying to buy sex.</p><p>他们的一些目标是卖性生活。其他人正在考虑自己的事。 ProPublica数据分析显示，在过去四年中因这些罪行而被捕的几乎所有人都是白人。在3,000名被指控购买性爱的人中有93％。</p><p>  Of the dozens of cops, lawyers and other experts ProPublica interviewed for this story, not a single one believes arrest figures for patronizing a prostitute accurately reflect the racial makeup of those who buy sex in New York City.</p><p>  在为这个故事而接受采访的数十名警察，律师和其他专家中，没有一个人相信因光顾妓女而被捕的人数准确反映了在纽约市购买性服务的人的种族构成。</p><p>  “I know for a fact that white men are the key demographic,” said Meredith Dank, a research professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who, along with her colleagues, has interviewed more than 600 young people who trade sex in the city. In one study, 65% said their main clients are white.</p><p>  约翰·杰伊刑事司法学院的研究教授梅瑞迪斯·丹克（Meredith Dank）说：“我知道白人是关键的人口统计学事实。”他与同事们面谈了该市600多名从事性交易的年轻人。在一项研究中，有65％的人说他们的主要客户是白人。</p><p>  People living paycheck to paycheck lost their jobs over crimes they swore never happened. But facing multiple court hearings and the threat of jail time, they took quick deals to move on with their lives. A former officer who worked undercover told ProPublica she participated in false arrests. Others acknowledged the system could let them slip through.</p><p>  依靠薪水支付薪水的人们因发誓从未发生的犯罪而失业。但是面对多次法庭听证会和入狱的威胁，他们迅速达成协议，继续了自己的生活。一名从事秘密工作的前官员告诉ProPublica，她参加了虚假逮捕。其他人则承认该系统可以让他们溜走。</p><p>  The problems became clear in interviews with 36 current and former officers and dozens of defendants, prosecutors and defense attorneys; weeks of observing court proceedings; and a review of hundreds of pages of sealed court records.</p><p>  在与36名现任和前任官员以及数十名被告，检察官和辩护律师的访谈中，问题变得很明显。遵守法院诉讼程序的几周；以及数百页密封法院记录的审阅。</p><p>  ProPublica delved into the work of one officer, identified in official documents as Undercover 157, whose cases are replete with allegations of false arrest and sexual misconduct that were never aired in court. Defense attorneys filed complaints with the Office of the Inspector General for the NYPD almost three years ago, which still considers it an “ongoing matter.” In a statement, the NYPD defended the undercover officer as a veteran “with approximately 1,800 successful buys and no complaints against him at the NYPD or with the Civilian Complaint Review Board.” (The department later clarified this meant no  active complaints.)</p><p>  ProPublica深入研究了一名官员的工作，该官员在官方文件中被称为Undercover 157，其案件中充斥着从未在法庭上宣扬的错误逮捕和性行为不端的指控。大约三年前，辩护律师向纽约警察局监察长办公室提出投诉，该办公室仍然认为这是“正在进行中的事情”。纽约警察局在一份声明中为卧底军官辩护，认为他是“老兵”，“成功购买了约1800次，在纽约警察局或平民投诉审查委员会中没有对他的投诉。” （该部门后来澄清，这意味着没有积极的投诉。）</p><p>    Even for a department accused in recent months of  acting with  impunity, those policing New York’s sex trade appear to operate in an extreme vacuum of accountability. The CCRB,  originally created to investigate police misconduct against communities of color, does not address allegations of false arrest and is still trying to gain authority to examine those involving sexual abuse.</p><p>    即使对于最近几个月被指控有罪不罚的部门来说，那些维护纽约性交易行为的部门似乎仍然在问责制的极端真空中运作。 CCRB最初是为了调查警察对有色人种的不当行为而创建的，它并未解决虚假逮捕的指控，并且仍在试图获得授权以审查涉及性虐待的人。 </p><p>  In the rare instances when defendants sue, the cases are often settled before officers have to testify.</p><p>在被告提起诉讼的极少数情况下，案件通常在官员必须作证之前就解决了。</p><p>  Since 2014, the city has paid more than a million in taxpayer dollars to at least 20 people who claimed they were falsely arrested in prostitution or “john” stings. Last year, it paid $150,000 to five young Latino men who said they were laughing off a proposition when they were arrested and $20,000 to a West African taxi driver who said in a sworn deposition that he was walking home when a woman asked if he’d walk down the block with her. He told ProPublica he thought she was afraid of walking alone, so he agreed. He was then arrested.</p><p>  自2014年以来，纽约市已向至少20名声称因卖淫或“约翰” st子而被错误逮捕的人支付了超过一百万美元的纳税人资金。去年，它向五名年轻的拉丁裔男子支付了15万美元，他们说他们在被捕时笑了，而向西非出租车司机支付了2万美元，后者在宣誓证词中说，当一个女人问他是否愿意时，他正回家。和她一起走下街区。他告诉ProPublica，他以为她怕独自一人走，所以他同意了。然后他被捕了。</p><p>  The undercover officer in his case netted 10 arrests in three and a half hours the night she encountered him, earning her four hours of overtime pay.</p><p>  在他的案件中，卧底警员在遇到他的那天晚上三个半小时内被捕10次，赚了四个小时的加班费。</p><p>  Eighteen current and former officers who policed the sale of sex in New York City said overtime has motivated them for years. The hours add up over the drive to the precinct, the questioning, the paperwork. “You arrest 10 girls, now the whole team’s making eight hours of overtime,” retired Sgt. Stephen Antiuk said.</p><p>  在纽约市负责买卖性行为的18名现任和前任官员说，加班激励了他们多年。这些时间加起来是开车到区，询问，文书工作的总和。 “您逮捕了10个女孩，现在整个团队加班了8个小时，”退休的军士中长。斯蒂芬·安蒂克（Stephen Antiuk）说。</p><p>  “That’s what it was all about, making money, from the lieutenant to the sergeant on down,” retired Detective John Kopack said. “You want to eat? You guys want to make some money tonight? Make some arrests, do what you got to do.”</p><p>  退休的侦探约翰·科帕克（John Kopack）说：“这就是要赚钱，从中尉到中士。” “你想吃？你们想今晚赚点钱吗？逮捕一些人，做你想做的事。”</p><p>  The NYPD did not respond to ProPublica’s detailed questions about overtime or the specific incidents in this story. Sgt. Jessica McRorie, an NYPD spokeswoman, said the department “maintains heightened vigilance and robust oversight over all of its undercover operations.” NYPD spokesman Al Baker said police shifted their prostitution strategy in 2017, leading to fewer arrests of sex workers, more of “johns” and a greater focus on “pimps.” He noted that selling sex is still illegal and the department “deploys officers where residents report crime” without consideration of race or ethnicity.</p><p>  纽约市警察局未回答ProPublica有关加班或此故事中特定事件的详细问题。中士纽约市警察局发言人杰西卡·麦克罗里（Jessica McRorie）表示，该部门“对其所有秘密行动保持高度警惕和强有力的监督。”纽约警察局发言人艾尔贝克说，警方在2017年改变了卖淫策略，导致更少的性工作者被捕，更多的“约翰”和更多的关注“皮条客”。他指出，卖淫仍然是违法的，该部门“在居民举报犯罪的地方部署官员”，不考虑种族或种族。</p><p>  As New York City’s crime rate fell to record lows in recent years, the NYPD continued to draw criticism for its outsized presence in minority neighborhoods, arresting tens of thousands of Black and Latino people on minor, nonviolent infractions. This dynamic inspired calls over the summer to “defund the police,” a slogan that depicts the department as an occupying force, disproportionately ensnaring people of color in the criminal justice system.</p><p>  由于纽约市的犯罪率近年来跌至历史最低水平，纽约警察局继续因其在少数族裔社区中的庞大存在而受到批评，逮捕了成千上万的黑人和拉丁美洲人，涉及轻微的非暴力违法行为。这个充满活力的灵感激发了整个夏天的呼吁，即“退还警察”，这是一个口号，描绘了该部门是占领军，在刑事司法系统中过分地笼罩着有色人种。 </p><p>  The statistics for arrests involving the sale of sex reflect a particularly stark example of this trend.</p><p>涉及买卖性行为的逮捕的统计数字反映了这一趋势的一个鲜明例子。</p><p>  Police Pledged to Arrest More Buyers Than Sex Workers. That Only Happened in Black and Latino Neighborhoods.</p><p>  警方承诺逮捕比性工作者更多的买家。那只发生在黑人和拉丁裔社区。</p><p>  While complaints about prostitution have long been scattered across neighborhoods of all races, arrests for buying sex are not. ProPublica found that in majority Black and Latino areas, police have arrested over three times as many alleged sex buyers as in whiter neighborhoods despite comparable complaints about prostitution and arrests of alleged sex workers in each.</p><p>  尽管对卖淫的抱怨长期散布在各个种族的社区中，但因购买性行为而被捕的情况却并非如此。 ProPublica发现，在大多数黑人和拉丁裔地区，警察逮捕了涉嫌性买主的人数是白人社区的三倍多，尽管人们对卖淫和在每个地方逮捕涉嫌性工作者的投诉相当可观。</p><p>  Michele Alexander, who is Black, sometimes worked undercover out of a precinct in Jamaica, Queens, before she retired in 2012. “When are we going to Manhattan?” she recalls asking her supervisor, after working too many sex buyer stings where the men all looked the same. “Negroes aren’t the only ones who buy vagina.” As punishment, she said she was reassigned to an early morning tour monitoring a Manhattan subway station.</p><p>  布莱克（Black）的米歇尔·亚历山大（Michele Alexander）在2012年退休之前，有时会在皇后区牙买加的一个秘密地区工作。她回想起她的上司后，在做过太多的性买手刺痛之后，这些男人看上去都一样。 “不是只有黑人买阴道。”作为惩罚，她说她已被安排去参加监视曼哈顿地铁站的清晨旅行。</p><p>    Paul Lichtbraun, a retired captain who oversaw vice in Manhattan and the Bronx until 2017, said his unit often focused on buyers, but when it received complaints about prostitution inside high-end Manhattan hotels, they’d only go after sex workers. “If I start arresting their paying customers, [the hotel’s] going to ask me to leave,” he said. “Are there always people who get off in this world? Of course there are.”</p><p>    退休的船长保罗·利希伯恩（Paul Lichtbraun）曾在曼哈顿和布朗克斯区任职，直到2017年为止。他说：“如果我开始逮捕他们的付费客户，（酒店）将要求我离开。” “在这个世界上总会有人下车吗？当然有。”</p><p>  Then, there is the community college student, stopped in a majority-Black neighborhood in Brooklyn that saw more buyer arrests in the past few years than all of Manhattan and Staten Island combined. Refusing to take a plea deal, he trekked to and from court for seven months. The prosecutor ultimately dropped the charges.</p><p>  然后，有一个社区大学生，在布鲁克林一个占多数的黑人社区停下来，在过去的几年中，逮捕的买家比曼哈顿和史坦顿岛的总和还多。拒绝接受辩诉交易，他在法庭上往返了七个月。检察官最终撤销了指控。</p><p>  The young man sued for false arrest and won a $15,000 settlement. But he lost something more fundamental, his ability to trust.</p><p>  这位年轻人以虚假逮捕为由提起诉讼，赢得了15,000美元的和解。但是他失去了更根本的东西，即信任的能力。 </p><p>  “When I see people on the street, asking for a jump or whatever, I just keep going,” he told ProPublica. “Can you imagine if it was really two girls on the corner waving for help? You just lost one guy who would stop.”</p><p>他告诉ProPublica：“当我在街上看到人们，要求跳跃或其他任何事情时，我就会继续前进。” “你能想象是否真的有两个女孩在拐角处招手帮助？你只不过少了一个人谁就会停止“。</p><p>   Whether police target sex workers or their clients, operations look much the same. Field teams of anywhere from eight to 16 officers are dispatched with the aim of securing verbal agreements of sex for money.</p><p>   无论警察是针对性工作者还是其客户，操作看起来都差不多。派出了八到十六名官员组成的实地小组，目的是确保口头上以金钱为代价的性协议。</p><p>  They often start with community complaints called “kites.” When there are none to follow, there are “strolls” or “tracks,” dark stretches in industrial sections of East New York or along Roosevelt Avenue in Queens where sex is bought and sold, noon and night. Massage parlors can be easy targets; words need not be spoken. Money lands on a table, there is a gesture in the motion of manual sex, a subtle nod in return.</p><p>  他们通常从社区投诉开始，称为“风筝”。当没有人跟随时，在纽约东部的工业区或皇后区罗斯福大街沿线的阴暗路段，在中午和晚上进行买卖。按摩室很容易成为目标。不用说话。金钱落在桌子上，在性交运动中有一种姿态，作为回报的微妙点头。</p><p>  Sometimes, no money is involved at all. “There has to be an exchange of a benefit,” said former Sgt. Louis Failla. He told the story of an undercover who once “made a deal with a crack prostitute on the street for a hamburger and fries from McDonald’s.” He always found it “humorous,” he said, “what these women would do just to get a few dollars.”</p><p>  有时，根本不涉及金钱。前中士表示：“必须交换利益。”路易斯·法伊拉。他讲述了一个秘密卧底的故事，他曾经“与大街上的妓女打交​​道，买了汉堡和麦当劳的薯条。”他说，他总是觉得这很“幽默”，“这些女人为了赚几美元会做什么。”</p><p>  Current and former undercover officers told ProPublica there’s an art to convincing their targets they aren’t cops. Some dirty their fingernails or rub newspaper on their knees to make it look like they’ve been providing oral sex on the street. One said that if a woman insisted he touch her breasts, he would do so, but he would never squeeze.</p><p>  现任和前任卧底军官告诉ProPublica，说服他们不是警察的目标是一种艺术。有些人弄脏了指甲或在膝盖上擦了报纸，使它们看起来像在街上进行口交。有人说，如果一个女人坚持要抚摸她的乳房，他会这么做，但他绝不会挤压。</p><p>  Sometimes, officers go in to arrest a woman and find she’s completely naked. Antiuk, the retired sergeant, laughed while describing the perks of the job. “The undercover can have a nice, cold beer and watch a girl take her clothes off — and he’s getting paid for it.”</p><p>  有时，警察会逮捕一名妇女，并发现她完全裸露。退休的中士安蒂克在描述这项工作的待遇时笑了起来。 “卧底可以喝一杯美味的冰镇啤酒，然后看着一个女孩脱下她的衣服，而他为此得到报酬。”</p><p>  Once the deal is made, the undercover signals that it’s time for the arrest. While backup officers can sometimes hear the incriminating conversations through a wireless device, they are not required to record. Some teams have come in after getting a signal from the undercover officer, having heard nothing of the exchange.</p><p>  达成交易后，便衣便发出信号，该该逮捕了。尽管备用人员有时可以通过无线设备听到令人讨厌的对话，但他们并不需要录音。一些团队在收到卧底人员的信号后进入，却没有听到任何交流。 </p><p>    Jazmia Inserillo, who retired as an NYPD officer in 2016, told ProPublica she participated in false arrests as an undercover officer without her backup team listening in. Sometimes, a young man would stop to flirt but hadn’t agreed to pay for sex before he was arrested. Once, a man pulled up and told the undercovers, “I know you the police,” she recalled. “And because he’s just talking, they just give the signal.”</p><p>贾兹米亚·英塞里洛（Jazmia Inserillo）于2016年作为纽约警察局的一名官员退休，他告诉ProPublica，她是秘密卧底人员，没有她的后备小组在场而参加虚假逮捕。已被逮捕。她回忆道，有一次，一个男人停下来告诉卧底：“我认识你，警察。” “而且因为他只是在讲话，所以他们只是发出信号。”</p><p>  Twice, men were clearly lost and stopped to ask for directions. “You’re not lost. You know what you came here for,” Inserillo remembers her partner saying one night. “What do you want, you looking for a blowjob?”</p><p>  两次，男人显然迷路了，停下来问路。 “您没有迷路。您知道您来这里的目的。” Inserillo记得她的伴侣说了一晚。 “您想要什么，您想要口交？”</p><p>    The man said he was looking for a street but couldn’t find it in the dark. As the three went back and forth, Inserillo remembered her partner lifting her back leg and leaning into the car, a signal to a backup team to initiate an arrest. “This girl puts her foot up while I’m in the middle of talking to him about cross streets,” Inserillo said.</p><p>    该名男子说他正在寻找一条街道，但在黑暗中找不到。当三人来回走动时，英塞里洛想起了她的搭档抬起后腿并斜倚在车上，向后备队发出逮捕信号。 Inserillo说：“当我正在与他谈论过马路的中间时，这个女孩站起来。”</p><p>  “And I look up at my lieutenant trying to signal no. But he didn’t really understand because we didn’t have a signal for no.”</p><p>  “而且我抬头看着我的中尉试图发信号否。但是他不是很明白，因为我们没有拒绝的信号。”</p><p>  She said she’d brought up another bad arrest to a supervisor, but he ignored it.</p><p>  她说，她又给主管带来了一次严重的逮捕，但他没有理会。</p><p>  John Hart, who was her lieutenant at that time and is now a deputy chief, told ProPublica no one in his unit ever mentioned false arrests to him. Inserillo later filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against a different superior officer over an unrelated incident, saying she endured  retaliation for reporting him. She won a $112,500  settlement.</p><p>  约翰·哈特（John Hart）当时是她的副手，现在是副局长，他告诉ProPublica，他所在单位中没有人向他提起过虚假逮捕。英塞里洛后来因一次不相关的事件对另一名高级官员提起了性骚扰诉讼，称她因举报他而受到报复。她赢得了$ 112,500的和解金。</p><p>  The department has had the equipment to covertly record agreements between undercover officers and targets for at least 20 years, but it does so inconsistently. Some officers told ProPublica their supervisors required them to record; others said they never taped a single arrest.</p><p>  该部门至少已有20年的时间使用了秘密记录秘密官员与目标之间的协议的设备，但这并不一致。一些官员告诉ProPublica，他们的主管要求他们记录。其他人则说，他们从未录音过一次。 </p><p>  “Almost none of these cases ever go to a courtroom, so that’s the reason recording was not a priority,” said Lichtbraun, the retired captain. “In vice, they weren’t always recorded. Frankly, they very often were not.”</p><p>“这些案件几乎都没有上过法庭，因此这就是录音不是优先事项的原因，”退休的船长利希伯恩说。 “反之，并非总是记录下来。坦白说，他们经常不是。”</p><p>  In 2016, a civil rights attorney asked a federal judge for an injunction that would forbid the department from making buyer arrests without recording them. Gabriel Harvis was representing a Black man arrested outside of a post office after being propositioned while getting a package from the trunk of his car. The man insisted he declined the sex offer, sued for false arrest and won $85,000. But the case settled before the injunction could be considered.</p><p>  2016年，一位民权律师要求一位联邦法官发出禁制令，禁止该部门在不记录买家的情况下逮捕他们。加布里埃尔·哈维斯（Gabriel Harvis）代表一个黑人，他从汽车后备箱中拿取包裹时被提议后在邮局外被捕。该男子坚持认为，他拒绝了性提议，以虚假逮捕为由，并赢得了8.5万美元。但是可以考虑在禁令前解决此案。</p><p>  Oren Yaniv, a spokesman for the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office, said prosecutors there did not know operations were sometimes recorded until ProPublica contacted them earlier this year. The office has handled more than 2,000 prostitution and patronizing cases since 2015.</p><p>  布鲁克林地方检察官办公室发言人奥伦·亚尼夫（Oren Yaniv）表示，直到今年早些时候ProPublica与他们联系之前，那里的检察官才知道有时会记录下行动。自2015年以来，该办公室已处理了2,000多个卖淫和光顾案件。</p><p>  Now that the office is aware of the recordings, Yaniv said, “we sometimes use and disclose them in cases we prosecute — those against pimps and traffickers. As in every case, if the police account raises questions or if we receive any information alleging problems with the arrest, we investigate further.”</p><p>  雅尼夫说，现在办公室知道了这些录音，“我们有时会在起诉的情况下使用和披露这些录音–那些针对皮条客和贩运者的录音。像在每种情况下一样，如果警察帐户提出问题，或者如果我们收到任何指控逮捕有问题的信息，我们将进行进一步调查。”</p><p>  The NYPD did not answer questions about when officers make recordings or why they choose not to. “For obvious safety and evidentiary reasons, the NYPD never discloses specifics of our tradecraft or investigatory methods in undercover cases.”</p><p>  NYPD没有回答有关警官何时录音或为何选择不录音的问题。 “出于明显的安全性和证据上的原因，NYPD从未在卧底案件中披露我们的工艺细节或调查方法。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/交易/">#交易</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/纽约/">#纽约</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/rs/">#rs</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/逮捕/">#逮捕</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
