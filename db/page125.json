Meanwhile tech companies are taking a far more flexible approach.\n As for workers themselves, more than half of those surveyed in a recent Pew Research Center survey said that, given the choice, they would want to keep working from home even after the pandemic subsides.\n Here&#39;s how some of the biggest names in tech and finance are handling the return to office life.\n  Apple expects employees to return to their offices three days a week come September, CEO Tim Cook wrote in an email to employees earlier this month, according to The Verge.\n &#34;For all that we&#39;ve been able to achieve while many of us have been separated, the truth is that there has been something essential missing from this past year: each other,&#34; Cook said in the email. &#34;Video conference calling has narrowed the distance between us, to be sure, but there are things it simply cannot replicate.&#34;\n Employees are expected to be in the office Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, but those with roles that allow for remote work will have the option to work from home Wednesdays and Fridays. The company is also offering up to two weeks of remote work annually and encouraging, but not requiring, vaccination.\n  Facebook announced earlier this month that employees can apply for remote work if their role allows. Any worker who wants to return to the office may do so on a flexible basis but is encouraged to spend at least half of their time in the office. Employees will also be granted 20 days each year to work from a remote location.\n Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees in a memo that he plans to continue working remotely for at least half of the next year, a company spokesperson confirmed to CNN Business.\n  Until September, Google workers around the world can continue to work remotely before deciding between coming back to their office, working out of a different Google office or applying for full-time remote work.\n &#34;The future of work is flexibility,&#34; CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a May memo to employees.\n Pichai said he expects about 60% of employees to return to their pre-pandemic offices while 20% move to a different office and 20% work from home.\n  Twitter has yet to set an exact start date for welcoming employees back to the office, but it plans to start with a 20% capacity limit.\n Early in the pandemic, the company said it plans to let some of its workforce continue working remotely &#34;forever&#34; if they choose.\n &#34;If our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work from home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen,&#34; said Twitter&#39;s vice president of people, Jennifer Christie, in a statement to CNN Business. &#34;If not, our offices will be their warm and welcoming selves, with some additional precautions, when we feel it&#39;s safe to return.&#34;\n The company has stressed that it wants employees to have the choice to return to the office, but it anticipates that most workers will opt for a hybrid model, spending some time in the office and some time at home.\n  Uber will shift to a hybrid model in September, according to an April blog post from Nikki Krishnamurthy, the company&#39;s chief people officer.\n Employees at the ride-hailing company are expected in the office three days a week, but they will have the option to work remotely the other two days.\n &#34;We feel that this combination of in-person and remote work will give people the freedom to do their best work while staying connected to their colleagues,&#34; Krishnamurthy said in the blog post.\n  Bank of America is encouraging, and expecting, all vaccinated employees to return to the office after Labor Day, CEO Brian Moynihan said this week.\n &#34;Our view is all the vaccinated teammates will be back,&#34; Moynihan said in a Bloomberg Television interview this week. &#34;We&#39;ll be able to operate fairly normally and will then start to make provisions for the other teammates as we move through the fall.&#34;\n The bank is not mandating employees to report their vaccination status, but it is expecting them to input their status in the company portal.\n  Citi said in March that it recognized how people have benefited from aspects of working remotely, and that it would embrace some flexibility in the return-to-office process.\n The bank said it expects up to 30% of US staff to return to the office in July. The majority of Citi workers globally will be designated as &#34;hybrid,&#34; working in the office at least three days a week and from home up to two days per week.\n  Goldman Sachs welcomed employees back to the office on Monday. The company is expecting 5,400 newly hired interns, analysts and associates in the office in addition to its returning employees.\n &#34;We are focused on progressing on our journey to gradually bring our people back together again, where it is safe to do so, and are now in a position to activate the next steps in our return to office strategy,&#34; the bank&#39;s leadership wrote in a May staff memo.\n Leading up to the return to in-person work, Goldman Sachs also mandated that its employees report their vaccination status. While vaccination is not required, the company is encouraging all staff to get vaccinated if possible.\n  Last month, JPMorgan opened all of its US offices to employees with a 50% occupancy cap. Executives at the bank informed staff that it expects all US-based employees back in the office by early July on a consistent rotational schedule, subject to the same 50% cap.\n &#34;We firmly believe that working together in person is important for our culture, clients, businesses and teams,&#34; JPMorgan executives said.\n  Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman took a hard line earlier this week, saying he expects the bank&#39;s New York employees back in the office by Labor Day.\n &#34;If you can go to a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office. And we want you in the office,&#34; Gorman said at an investing conference.\n The company has not mandated vaccination, but Gorman noted that &#34;well over 90%&#34; of employees had already received their Covid-19 vaccination. That number is expected to hit 98% to 99%, according to Gorman.\n The bank will continue to consider returning to the office on a case-by-case basis, Gorman said, recognizing that some employees may not be able to be vaccinated, or may be in a different situation if their office is outside of New York.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 06:11:59", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5de5\u4eba,rushing,\u5458\u5de5", "title": "\u516c\u53f8\u5411\u5de5\u4eba\u8d76\u56de\u529e\u516c\u5ba4 ", "title_en": "The companies rushing workers back to the office", "transed": 1, "url": "https://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_63f084b70df88bccd604e9b93404fcf9", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5de5\u4eba", "rushing", "\u5458\u5de5"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "9ec701e64dee3acc626b9f967e34ee5b.jpg", "infoid": 1067090, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Ryan Reynolds\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u4ed6\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7535\u5f71\u5229\u57fa - \u4e00\u79cd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4ed6\u7f55\u89c1\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\u4eba\u770b\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u81ea\u6211\u8d2c\u4f4e\u7684\u53ef\u6cbb\u8d28\uff0c\u806a\u660e\u5730\u8bbd\u523a\u7684\u5e7d\u9ed8\u611f\u3002\u4ed6\u57282016\u5e74\u7eaf\u7cb9\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff0c\uff06\uff0339;

He was sheer perfection in 2016&#39;s raunchy, R-rated blockbuster,   Deadpool. Reynolds is at his best when he has a strong co-star to play off of as a foil, and he has that in Samuel L. Jackson and Salma Hayek, his co-stars in\u00a0  The Hitman&#39;s Wife&#39;s Bodyguard, Yes, it&#39;s an awkward title for this sequel to 2017&#39;s action/comedy,   The Hitman&#39;s Bodyguard. But if you liked that movie (I thought it was a blast), chances are you&#39;ll enjoy this latest flawed-but-fun outing.\n  In the first film, Reynolds&#39; ambitious, tightly controlled, triple-A rated &#34;executive protection agent,&#34; Michael Bryce, finds his professional life in shambles after one of this clients is assassinated on his watch. Two years later, his ex-girlfriend (an Interpol agent) reluctantly hires him to protect hitman Darius Kinkaid (Jackson). Darius is a key witness in the trial of the ruthless dictator of Belarus (Gary Oldman), agreeing to testify in exchange for the release of his con-artist wide, Sonia (Hayek) from prison. Michael has to get Darius from London to the International Criminal Court while being pursued by all the crack assassins and firepower the Belarus dictator can muster. Do they ultimately succeed and save the day against nigh-impossible odds? Do you really need to ask?\n The Hitman&#39;s Bodyguard grossed $176.6 million globally\u2014not a bad showing\u2014but it received decidedly mixed reviews. Although almost everyone praised the onscreen comic chemistry between Reynolds and Jackson, much of the criticism targeted the fairly generic, cliche-ridden script. Audiences were more forgiving. One person&#39;s tired cliche is another&#39;s time-honored trope, after all, and raunchy, entertaining, R-rated comedy/action flicks are in short supply these days.\n    The Hitman&#39;s Wife&#39;s Bodyguard\u00a0brings us more of the same. We find Michael still in bodyguard exile, despite his successful mission with Kinkaid. Even his therapist can&#39;t wait to get rid of him, suggesting he take a sabbatical to Capri. He just wants to lounge poolside and read  The Secret in peace, but fate (in the form of Sonia) intervenes. Per the official premise:\n    The world\u2019s most lethal odd couple\u2014bodyguard Michael Bryce and hitman Darius Kincaid\u2014are back on another life-threatening mission. Still unlicensed and under scrutiny, Bryce is forced into action by Darius\u2019s even more volatile wife, the infamous international con artist Sonia Kincaid. As Bryce is driven over the edge by his two most dangerous protectees, the trio get in over their heads in a global plot and soon find that they are all that stand between Europe and a vengeful and powerful madman (Antonio Banderas). Joining in the fun and deadly mayhem is Morgan Freeman as...well, you\u2019ll have to see.\n The screwball/slapstick comedy aspects are more pronounced this time around, as is the cheese factor. \u00a0Once again, it&#39;s the on-screen chemistry between the three leads that makes the movie work. Reynolds and Jackson settle smoothly into their usual bickering interplay, and having Michael insist upon not carrying a gun\u2014relying on pepper spray and his trusty Swiss Army knife (&#34;they never see it coming&#34;) because his therapist advised against it\u2014makes for a solid running gag. Hayek once again shows a real gift for physical comedy, as well as impressively long, profane rants in Spanish (often left untranslated).\n Among the supporting cast, Tom Hopper\u2014best known as Luther in Netflix&#39;s   The Umbrella Academy\u2014steals his scenes as Magnusson, a superstar bodyguard who is Michael&#39;s arch-rival. Banderas gleefully camps it up as villainous Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Papadopoulos, and Richard E. Grant is back for a brief cameo as the flamboyant, drug-addicted corporate executive Mr. Seifert.\u00a0(It&#39;s always nice to see Frank Grillo, but he is wasted as Interpol agent Bobby O&#39;Neill.)\n You could level many of the same criticisms against  The Hitman&#39;s Wife&#39;s Bodyguard as its predecessor;\u00a0many reviewers already have. Is it ridiculously over the top at times? Sure, although director Patrick Hughes leans into the sillier aspects with tongue firmly in cheek. Does it follow a familiar action/buddy comedy formula? Yes, complete with car chases, explosions, a spot of torture, and double-crossing twists. The first act is kind of clumsy\u2014although the film finds its footing by the second\u2014and it&#39;s not that difficult to predict how (almost) everything plays out.\u00a0None of that matters, because ultimately the movie is just a fun, wild ride with three terrific, hugely charismatic leads carrying it through any rough spots.\n The Hitman&#39;s Wife&#39;s Bodyguard is now playing in theaters. We strongly recommend only returning to theaters after being fully vaccinated.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 05:36:11", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

dominant force in web and mobile search won\u2019t surprise you. What might, though, is that roughly two thirds of the searches on Google never leave the search results page. That is, the searchers get what they are looking for without leaving Google. These are called \u201cno-click\u201d or \u201czero-click\u201d searches.\n    The percentages vary a bit depending on device, geography, and the precise definition of \u201cno-click,\u201d but it\u2019s clear that Google is retaining a large share of searchers within its domain. Search expert Rand Fishkin, who  compiled much of this data, thinks that the percentage of no-click searches will continue to rise.\n  In their early years, search engines were expected to produce a set of links to the most relevant web pages. \u201cTen blue links\u201d were the norm. Over time, that evolved\u2014ads appeared, often looking much like the natural, or \u201corganic,\u201d results. Links to images, videos, and other content types also began to appear.\n    Even then, to get the information you wanted, you still clicked through to another site. That was good news for both entrepreneurs and large brands: if you created content that people wanted, Google would send them to you\u2014for free!\n      When Google launched, there were already popular search engines\u2014AltaVista, Yahoo, Excite, Lycos and others. These competitors had a lot in common. First, their search functionality was a small text entry box on a page cluttered with ads, news, content, directory links, and other distracting elements. They all saw being a \u201cportal,\u201d a monetized doorway to everything on the Web, as their path to success.\n    Second, their search results weren\u2019t very good. Because their rankings were highly dependent on page content, those rankings could be manipulated by optimizers. Even when there was no aggressive optimization, often the results were not good answers to the search because so many pages were designed in a way that confused the search engine algorithms.\n    Google is an early case study in my book  Friction, where I show how they focused on minimizing user effort. Their home page was essentially white space with a search box in the middle\u2014no confusion or distraction. This focus on the user\u2019s intent stood in stark contrast to their competition.\n  The big difference, though, was in the quality of Google\u2019s results. Their PageRank algorithm created a map of the Web as a giant recommendation engine. On competing search engines, a user might go through pages of results, clicking on many links, before finding what they wanted. With Google, the desired result was likely the top one, or at least in the top few.\n    Over time, Google continued to deliver ever more relevant links while also making manipulating results more difficult. But no detail missed their attention. For example, the user who goes to Google.com finds the cursor already positioned in the search box. A small thing, perhaps but it saves every user a click or tap. Even today, I constantly encounter web pages where entering something is to sole purpose of the page but the cursor isn\u2019t pre-positioned for me.\n  Another major keystroke saver was  predictive search. Start typing in the search box, and Google immediately begins to offer guesses for your search term. Type \u201cw\u201d and the first two suggestions will be \u201cweather\u201d and \u201cWalmart,\u201d no doubt the two most common searches starting with that letter. Additional characters spawn new high-probability guesses.\n    In my own experience, it\u2019s rare that I have to type in a complete search phrase. In fact, Google\u2019s suggestions are often a better way of phrasing what I wanted and likely yield more relevant results.\n  Here\u2019s the dilemma for Google: once all the user has to do is type a character or two to search, how does further reduce user effort? The answer is simple: if Google understands what the user wants, why not just  deliver the information instead of a  link to the information?\n    Increasingly, Google tries to provide the information the searcher wants on the search results page. For example, if one clicks \u201cweather\u201d after typing \u201cw,\u201d Google provides a large amount of weather data for the user\u2019s location at the top of the results: current conditions, plus hourly and daily forecasts. Most users probably find what they need without having to click through to weather.com, where the data is sourced.\n    Delivering the desired information in a simple, standard format saves more than the initial click. If the user navigates to a new site, they may have to expend additional effort to acclimate to the new site\u2019s design and to search the page for the desired information.\n  In some cases, the effort differential could be quite high. Imagine, for example, scrolling through a lengthy FAQ page vs. Google delivering only the necessary answer. Even weather.com offers only a five-day forecast on its home page - if you want to know what\u2019s predicted for a week from the current day, you\u2019ll have to click to a different page.\n  User experience can suffer, too. More than once I\u2019ve clicked through to the site from where Google obtained an answer and been assaulted by cookie warnings, pop-ups, and slow-loading pages packed with advertising.\n  A no-click result seems like a win for users, and it almost always is. The loser, if there is one, is the website where Google found the information. Users who might have lingered, consumed other content, subscribed, bought something, or created ad impressions now never get to the website.\n    Google is being assailed on all sides from regulators trying to rein in their power. Ohio wants them to be  regulated like a public utility. U.S. politicians are  drafting antitrust legislation.\n  What\u2019s different about the current anti-trust sentiment affecting not just Google but other big tech companies is that consumers may not agree they are being harmed. Historically, with no competition, monopolies charged higher prices and frequently offered poor service. If you live an an area with only one high speed internet provider, you may still experience this.\n  The big tech companies aren\u2019t monopolies in the classic sense, but dominate because of their scale and integration. No company, large or small, has the logistics infrastructure that Amazon does. Amazon\u2019s customers, though, aren\u2019t complaining. They love free, next-day delivery for almost anything. Facebook has billions of daily users, and none of them pay Facebook to use their services.\n  Similarly, few users feel they are harmed by Google\u2019s dominance. Users prefer Google despite very credible alternatives like Microsoft\u2019s Bing. A key factor in keeping Google users loyal is that they can find what they need with lower effort. As long as using Google is faster and easier, searchers will gravitate to it.\n  In fact,  Google itself disputes that third party websites are being harmed as described by Fishkin. They note that many searches don\u2019t result in a click because the searcher refines their query or uses a link like \u201crelated searches.\u201d They also point out that users can interact with a business directly without having to click. For example, a customer who viewed the address and operating hours of a local business could visit that business despite the lack of a click.\n  Beyond effort-saving, an additional factor that ensures no-click searches are here to stay is the explosion in smart speaker use. If you ask your Google Assistant or Alexa a question, you don\u2019t want multiple options to get the information. You want the answer.\n  I predict that Google will continue to use and expand its no-click results. Absent legislative or regulatory intervention, they have no reason to impair their user experience.

The reality was entirely different. Financial insecurity, increased parental responsibilities and anxiety about the future, along with other difficulties, prompted many to delay or forego having a baby. Economists are now projecting 300,000 fewer births in the United States this year than would have been expected before the pandemic.\n Demographic changes can have economic ramifications. Falling birthrates mean smaller generations of taxpayers will eventually be responsible for supporting larger generations of retirees. Historically, therefore, governments have viewed a declining birthrate as an existential threat, raising the spectre of decline or extinction. The question of how direct government action might encourage a higher birthrate is not new; European governments have been grappling with this question for decades, France foremost among them.\n France was the first country in Europe to undergo demographic transition, a sustained drop in both mortality and birth rates. Most European states experienced the transition gradually; mortality rates fell during the 18th and 19th centuries, yet birthrates remained high until roughly the early 20th century. In 18th-century France, they happened almost simultaneously. As a result, 19th-century demographers warned that France\u2019s population was increasing only marginally, in contrast to the rapid growth of its neighbours. Experts and reformers interpreted the country\u2019s defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 as a warning of what could happen to a \u2018decadent\u2019 country heading towards depopulation.\n The urgency of the crisis intensified in the last decade of the century, when the \u2018Russian influenza\u2019 briefly increased mortality rates. This pandemic, which began in autumn 1889 and continued into early 1894, killed at least one million people globally. In France, which had registered only modest annual population gains even before the pandemic (due to the country\u2019s low birthrate), the outbreak had a sobering effect. Deaths had actually exceeded births in the years 1890, 1891, 1892 and 1895.  As coffins outnumbered cradles, France\u2019s fledgling pro-natalist movement stepped up its campaign, urging the public to have more babies and lobbying for government action. It contrasted France\u2019s modest population gains with those of its neighbours, using powerful images that, for example, represented France as a small, frail man standing next to a tall, muscular Germany.\n Historians generally see the years following the First World War as the moment when French elected officials began systematically trying to influence population trends. After sustaining devastating numbers of casualties during the conflict, France\u2019s prospects for demographic recovery seemed poor. While there was some population growth in the interwar years (1919-39), this was due mostly to immigration, rather than an excess of births over deaths. The sluggish growth gave pro-natalist rhetoric a convincing sense of urgency. As the pro-natalist leader Jacques Bertillon wrote in 1919, France\u2019s victory in 1918 would be meaningless if its low birthrate continued to leave the country vulnerable to invasion.\n As French policy makers and reformers tried to encourage more births, they had to grapple with the question of why the birthrate was low to begin with. Pro-natalists offered explanations for the trend towards small families, including the modern desire for social mobility, migration to cities from country villages, tax and inheritance laws and the high cost of housing and education. Beyond financial and logistical obstacles, they saw a much more insidious cause. Many people, women specifically, simply did not want large families.\n Gender had everything to do with this assessment. Pro-natalists asserted that women\u2019s declining fertility rates were symptomatic of the breakdown of the family and gender roles. Propaganda conjured up images of a vast epidemic of modern women lacking a maternal instinct and choosing a life of voluntary sterility as they cared more about maintaining a fashionable figure than devoting themselves to a family. These images were more rhetoric than reality, however. Data indicates that most women of this generation did become mothers; they may have preferred smaller families, but they were not choosing a child-free existence.\n Some government action in this period aimed to make it harder for women to choose smaller families. This included two laws passed in 1920: one making it illegal to sell or distribute contraceptive devices or information; the other strengthening the existing law punishing illegal abortions. There was also a strong push to offer an array of financial benefits and rewards, such as allowances, to families with children. This was in part to incentivise more births and make it easier to support larger families. It was also about encouraging the population to see the process of producing and raising the next generation of soldiers, workers and mothers as a collective responsibility. Such propaganda made it clear that those who chose to have few or no children \u2013 and it was usually presented as a choice \u2013 would have to help support the children of more prolific households. It depicted exhausted parents raising large families in squalid conditions, while childless couples lived in luxury, an injustice that could only be corrected through family benefits.\n In the decades that followed, the French government expanded many of these pro-natalist benefits, and introduced new ones. Naturally, France\u2019s history of demographic policies raises the question of just how effective such measures can be. After the Second World War, for example, family allowances were generous, sometimes even representing an entire second income for low-income families with many children. This benefit was lauded as a success and credited with contributing to France\u2019s postwar baby boom. In one 1950 survey, for example, 97 per cent of respondents agreed that family allowances encouraged a higher birthrate. Yet scholars are unconvinced that these benefits actually explain France\u2019s postwar baby boom. Similar demographic phenomena were recorded in most western countries after the war, including in countries such as the US that did not deploy a pro-natalist strategy. Significantly, too, while relatively generous family benefits continued beyond the 1960s, France\u2019s postwar baby boom did not.\n As in the US, in France the pandemic has now accelerated what was already a downward trend.

you&#39;re wondering, you&#39;d need about 2000 feature-length movies to occupy that many waking hours.\n Sit back and relax. Jupiter is more than 3 times as far as we just traveled.\n   This is where we might at least see some asteroids to wake us up.  \u00a0 Too bad they&#39;re all too small to appear on this map.\n  If you were on a road trip, driving at 75mi/hr, it would have taken you over 500 years to get here from earth.\n All these distances are just averages, mind you.  \u00a0 The distance between planets really depends on where the two planets are in their orbits around the sun. \u00a0 So if you&#39;re planning on taking a trip to Jupiter, you might want to use a different map.\n If you plan it right, you can actually move relatively quickly between planets. \u00a0 The New Horizons space craft that launched in 2006 only took 13 months to get to Jupiter. \u00a0 Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;ll take a lot less than 13 months to scroll there.\n     I guess this is why most maps of the solar system aren&#39;t drawn to scale. \u00a0  It&#39;s not hard to draw the planets.  \u00a0 It&#39;s the empty space that&#39;s a problem.\n   When it comes to things like the age of the earth, the number of snowflakes in Siberia, the national debt... \u00a0 Those things are too much for our brains to handle.\n We need to reduce things down to something we can see or experience directly in order to understand them.\n We&#39;re always trying to come up with metaphors for big numbers. Even so, they never seem to work.\n  You would need    of these screens lined up side-by-side to show this whole map at once.\n If this map was printed from a quality printer (300 pixels per inch) the earth would be invisible, and the width of the paper would need to be 475 feet. \u00a0 475 feet is about 1 and 1/2 football fields.\n Even though we don\u2019t really understand them, a lot can happen within these massive lengths of time and space. \u00a0  A drop of water can carve out a canyon. \u00a0 An amoeba can become a dolphin. \u00a0 A star can collapse on itself.\n It\u2019s easy to disregard nothingness because there\u2019s no thought available to encapsulate it. There\u2019s no metaphor that fits because, by definition, once the nothingness becomes tangible, it ceases to exist.\n It\u2019s a good thing we have these tiny stars and planets, otherwise we\u2019d have no point of reference at all. \u00a0 We\u2019d be surrounded by this stuff that our minds weren\u2019t built to understand.\n All this emptiness really could drive you nuts. For instance, if you\u2019re in a sensory deprivation tank for too long, your brain starts to make things up. You see and hear things that aren\u2019t there.\n  &#34;Sorry, Humanity,&#34; says Evolution. &#34;What with all the jaguars trying to eat you, the parasites in your fur, and the never-ending need for a decent steak, I was a little busy. I didn\u2019t exactly have time to come up with a way to conceive of vast stretches of nothingness.&#34;\n Neurologically speaking, we really only deal with matter of a certain size, and energy of a few select wavelengths. For everything else, we have to make up mental models and see if they match up to the tiny shreds of hard evidence that actually feel real.\n The mental models provided by mathematics are extremely helpful when trying to make sense of these vast distances, but still... \u00a0 Abstraction is pretty unsatisfying.\n When you hear people talk about how, &#34;there\u2019s more to this universe than our minds can conceive of&#34; it&#39;s usually a way to get you to go along with a half-baked plot point about UFOs or super-powers in a sci-fi series that you&#39;re watching late at night when you can\u2019t get to sleep.\n Even when Shakespeare wrote: &#34;There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy\u201d \u2013 he&#39;s basically trying to give us a loophole to make the ghost in the story more believable.\n But all this empty space, these things of a massive scale, really are more than our minds can conceive of. The maps and metaphors fail to do them justice.\n You look at one tiny dot, then you look for the next tiny dot. Everything in between is inconsequential and fairly boring.\n   If the proton of a hydrogen atom was the size of the sun on this map, we would need 11 more of these maps to show the average distance to the electron.\n Some theories say all this emptiness is actually full of energy or dark matter and that nothing can truly be empty... \u00a0 but come on, only ordinary matter has any meaning for us.\n  If so much of the universe is made up of emptiness, what does that mean to people like us, living on a tiny speck in the middle of all of it?\n  With so much emptiness, aren&#39;t stars, planets, and people just glitches in an otherwise elegant and uniform nothingness, like pieces of lint on a black sweater?\n But without the tiny dots for it to stretch between, there would be no emptiness to measure, and for that matter, no one around to measure it.\n You might say that so much emptiness makes the tiny bits of matter that much more meaningful - simply by the fact that, against all odds, they  aren&#39;t empty. \u00a0 If you&#39;re drowning in the middle of the ocean, a floating piece of driftwood is a pretty big deal.\n What if trillions of stars and planets were crammed right next to each other? They wouldn&#39;t be special at all.\n It seems like we are both pathetically insignificant, and miraculously important at the same time.\n Whether you more strongly feel the monumental significance of tiny things or the massive void between them depends on who you are, and how your brain chemistry is balanced at a particular moment.  We walk around with miniature, emotional versions of the universe inside of us.\n It&#39;s reassuring to know that no matter how depressingly bleak or ridiculously momentous we feel, the universe, judging by its current structure, seems well aware of both extremes.\n The fact that you&#39;re here, in the midst of all this nothing, is pretty amazing when you stop and think about it.\n  Might as well stop now. We&#39;ll need to scroll through 6,771 more maps like this before we see anything else.

The effects of inflation not only are greater, but disproportionately greater, for poorer people. Those with higher incomes often offset price increases (goods, services) with increased income. Furthermore, prices often increase more for basic needs than for luxury items, a phenomenon economists call \u201cinflation inequality.\u201d Simply put, low-income families\u2019 budgets will stress and strain as they confront the coming rising costs of the essentials they need (food, energy, transport, child care).\n  The economic well-being of the most economically vulnerable Americans too often tends to be discussed as a matter of the latest Washington program or policy. Those acting in the name of \u201ceconomic justice\u201d need to pay more attention to basic economic indicators such as employment rates by demographic group, incomes and, yes, inflation, if we want to truly understand what\u2019s happening not just to the economy in a general sense but specifically to the most vulnerable within it.\n  As coming waves of inflation will demonstrate, the fundamentals\u2014and not the latest federal government initiative\u2014will most directly characterize and affect the economic well-being of the most economically vulnerable in our country.\n  You will be charged $  + tax (if applicable) for The Wall Street Journal.

But a growing contingent of medical experts is now questioning whether that conventional wisdom ought to apply to children.\n Their doubts are not borne of conspiracy beliefs, but couched in the carefully calibrated language of risk and benefit. And they&#39;re expected to  get a public airing next week as advisors to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ponder a spate of post-vaccine heart problems in adolescents and young adults.\n No one is arguing that COVID-19 immunizations for kids should stop altogether. Rather, a debate has erupted over the need to inoculate healthy children as soon as possible and according to the two-dose regimen authorized by the Food and Drug Administration.\n  The vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have been administered safely to millions of adults and been vetted in several thousand adolescents. But neither has been subjected to exhaustive testing in diverse pediatric populations, as is typically required for a vaccine intended for universal use in kids.\n The FDA authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for emergency use in adolescents as young as 12 on May 10. In the weeks that have followed, the safety monitoring systems managed by the FDA and CDC detected dozens of cases of a possible side effect in newly vaccinated teens: an inflammation of the heart muscle known as  myocarditis.\n The cases typically developed in older adolescents, most of them boys, three to four days after they got a second dose. Virtually all were considered mild, presenting as chest pain and tightness that resolved after treatment with over-the-counter medications. None of the patients appear to have died or suffered serious cardiac malfunction, though it&#39;s too early to know whether they will suffer long-term effects.\n As of June 10, the government&#39;s vaccine monitoring systems detected 226 cases of myocarditis or a related condition called  pericarditis after vaccination in people younger than 30. Normally, fewer than 100 cases would be expected for this age group, said  Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, deputy director of the CDC&#39;s Immunization Safety Office.\n  More investigation is needed to determine whether the vaccine caused these heart problems or if the timing was merely a coincidence, he said.\n Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine specialist at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the reports will give the CDC\u2019s  Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices an opportunity to \u201cgive people a clinic on relative risk\u201d \u2014 as it did after the COVID-19 vaccine made by Johnson &amp; Johnson was  linked to a rare blood-clotting disorder in younger women but still  deemed safe for use.\n Offit said he doubts the myocarditis cases will upend the long-standing certainty that kids should be vaccinated quickly.\n  Others aren\u2019t so sure. The possibility that children getting the vaccine \u2014 especially a second dose \u2014 could put their hearts at risk has amplified calls for more debate before parents, schools and others embrace the conviction that all healthy children need to get vaccinated.\n  It\u2019s not just the prospect of a surprise side effect that has prompted the sudden surge in vaccine caution.\n As the pandemic appears to be winding down across the United States and its limited toll on children has been tallied, it\u2019s no longer clear that immunizing children will bring the outbreak to a faster close, said  Dr. Martin Makary, a public health expert at Johns Hopkins University.\n Makary is urging his colleagues to \u201cthink twice\u201d before recommending universal COVID-19 vaccination of healthy kids. Given the data in hand, \u201cthere\u2019s no compelling case for it right now,\u201d he  wrote this month in MedPage, a website widely read by physicians.\n In an interview, Makary said his concerns might be allayed with a more thorough examination of the safety data.\n \u201cBut no one is thinking like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve converted now from being pro-vaccine to vaccine fanaticism.\u201d\n Given the general decline in new infections and hospitalizations, there\u2019s time for a thorough FDA vetting of the vaccines for children and adolescents, Makary said. Even if it takes months, it could wind up protecting more children from harm.\n The emerging debate threatens to divide a community that\u2019s largely been united by the pandemic.\n From the moment that the first COVID-19 vaccine started  going into Americans&#39; arms, one certainty has seemed almost beyond questioning: As soon as enough doses were available, the nation\u2019s children would roll up their sleeves.\n  Although it\u2019s clear COVID-19 has largely spared children from severe illness, the CDC says  456 American kids have died of the disease, though that is considered a conservative estimate.\n At least 20,000 \u2014 and as many as 100,000 \u2014 kids have been hospitalized with COVID-19. Indeed, the CDC reports that even as adult hospitalizations declined in March and April, the rate at which adolescents were admitted ticked upward. Nearly one-third were treated in intensive care units, undercutting the argument that severe illness rarely happens in this age group.\n COVID-19\u2019s toll on some children also lingers well beyond a bout of infection. As of mid-May, at least 4,018 in the U.S. have developed a condition called  multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MISC, that frequently appears four to six weeks after a child has cleared his or her infection and typically requires hospitalization.\n  If COVID-19 were a disease seen only in children, statistics such as these would galvanize medical professionals and public health officials to find a way to protect them, New York pediatrician  Dr. Risa Hoshino wrote in a  MedPage commentary sparked in part by Makary\u2019s views.\n By any definition, COVID-19 has been an emergency for the nation\u2019s children and the FDA\u2019s emergency use authorization is an \u201cappropriate pathway\u201d for getting vaccines to young Americans, she added.\n At Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, pediatric cardiologist  Dr. Jodie Votava-Smith has seen the wreckage of COVID-19 firsthand, and she has no doubts about the value of vaccinating kids.\n In the last month, she has helped treat a patient who developed myocarditis after a dose of vaccine, she said. The child\u2019s symptoms were mild and readily treated with ibuprofen.\n Votava-Smith said her assessment of vaccines\u2019 value has been more profoundly shaped by the dozens of children treated at CHLA for serious heart muscle inflammation as a result of having COVID-19. These children were severely ill and now face potentially enduring health effects. The disease was the cause of their misery, she said, not the vaccine.\n The mother of two children who are 5 and 7, Votava-Smith said she \u201ccan\u2019t wait\u201d to get them vaccinated. \u201cThey know they\u2019ll be getting their shot when it\u2019s their turn,\u201d she said.\n Dr. H. Cody Meissner, a Tufts University pediatrician who advises the FDA on vaccines, said it&#39;s a mistake to evaluate COVID-19 vaccines for children in the same way as it was cleared for emergency use in adults.\n \u201cThe risk calculation for vaccinating an adult is pretty easy,\u201d he said. When as many as 4,000 adults a day were dying of COVID-19, \u201ceven if there was a little risk of vaccine, most people would accept that.\u201d\n But for children, he said, \u201cthe calculus is a bit different.\u201d Although they seem to contract the coronavirus pretty readily, they\u2019re far less likely than adults to get sick or die. So even if instances of post-vaccination myocarditis are rare, they still change the risk-benefit analysis.\n \u201cThe data are not sufficient to say that the benefit of these COVID-19 vaccines outweighs the risk in children and adolescents,\u201d Meissner said. \u201cWe may get there. But we\u2019re not there now.\u201d\n  Updates:  8:08 AM, Jun. 18, 2021:  This story originally said the CDC vaccine advisory committee would discuss COVID-19 vaccines for children at a meeting on Friday, June 18.

", "note_en": "Docker Inc. started like many startups with engineers working from a single location. For us, this was in the Bay Area in the US. We were very office-centric, so the natural way to increase diversity and to get engineers from different cultures to work together was to open new offices in diverse locations. Right from the start, our goal was to mix American and European ways of producing software, giving us the best of both cultures.\n  In 2015, Docker started to open offices in Europe, starting with Cambridge in the United Kingdom and followed by Paris in France. With these two locations, the long road to gaining experience working with remote employees began.\n Having multiple offices scattered around the world is different from being fully remote. But you still start experiencing some of the challenges of not having everybody in the same location simultaneously. We spent a great deal of our time on planes or trains visiting each other.\n Despite the robust open-source culture of the company, which shows that you can build great software while not having everybody in the same room, we still had a very office-centric culture. A lot of the context of a given product conversation or decision was linked to a given office. When you were not in the office where the decision was made, you only had partial information about the decision.\n We learned a lot during this time: organizing work effectively and enjoyably while appreciating different cultures, time zones (France and US West Coast are 9 hours apart\u2026), paperwork, salary expectations, public holidays, etc.\n  The products Docker builds have a significant impact on the world, so hiring great engineers has never been a problem at Docker. We were artificially limiting ourselves to hiring talent close to one of our offices. We could open more offices or start hiring people as fully remote wherever they lived. In 2017, we hired a couple of very experienced remote engineers who had 5+ years of experience working remotely. They brought a lot of their best practices, and with them, the company learned how to be better at working with remote engineers.\n One of the areas we made changes was in how we ran meetings. Instead of only having remote employees dial in and struggling to follow conversations in conference rooms, we got everyone, even those in offices, to dial in with a good headset so that everyone was on the same level. This drastically improves the quality of meetings for those who are remote.\n We also learned the power of good writing as time zones forced communication to be more asynchronous. Concise, clear, and effective, writing became critical.\n We worked hard on our company core values, one of them is \u201cOpen Collaboration\u201d. Following that value, we started to close 1600+ slack channels to concentrate our communication around just a few dozen. We advocated for communication to happen in public slack channels by default and limiting the usage of private channels to only when necessary.\n Remote engineers felt better, but there was still a life in the office they couldn\u2019t grasp, this is when we introduced  Wormholes. Wormholes are pretty low-tech, they are a monitor, a camera, and speakers open in the offices all day. Remote engineers connect to it, have a view of the offices, and can feel the ambiance and hear general conversations. They can also slack someone to come close to the wormhole for \u201cdirect\u201d communication. They were pretty popular until we left our offices to start working from home.\n  In early 2020, once we were pretty experienced at remote working, we advocated for all positions to be open in any country that we had legal entities, making it easier for us to hire good talent.\n Then Covid hit us along with everyone else. Relatively confident in our experience of working remotely, we thought that we were more ready than others to have everyone working at home. We quickly realized that working remotely and working remotely through a pandemic are not the same at all.\n While we had the software and culture to embrace a remote-first workforce, the pandemic itself brought new challenges. Not being able to see each other in the office or family and relatives for such a long time has taken a toll on everybody. This also highlighted inequality that we didn\u2019t realize before: people with small apartments, young kids, or living alone were hit harder than those living with relatives and enjoying a large house.\n These hard-learned lessons fueled the way we shape the future of work at Docker. Giving employees help to set up their home office, helping them move from one city to another, and generally spending enough time and energy making sure everybody is comfortable as we transition to this exciting new future of work.\n  While other companies are pushing their employees to get back to offices, we decided that there is no turning back for Docker Inc. and that we will stay remote-first. All of our offices are closed and will remain so.

We wish you a long and healthy life. 100 years and more!\n You have probably seen the evolution of CPUs \u2013 from 16-bit to 32-bit CPUs and later from 32-bit to 64-bit CPUs. The logical question arises \u2013 when will 128-bit processors arrive?\n 128-bit CPU, when talking about computer architecture, means that this processor must have 128-bit integers and a 128-bit bus. It is not x2 better than 64-bit. It is not that simple at all.\n While in the past there was a need to address more memory, the current 64-bit CPUs can handle so much RAM that you can\u2019t even imagine. To be precise, the amount is 2^64 bytes or 18.44 exabytes. 1 exabyte is 1 billion gigabytes! You won\u2019t see this amount of RAM probably ever in your life. 4 Gb for a 32-bit system can be sufficient or 8 Gb for normal office work on a 64-bit OS would also work. Some cutting edge devices have 64 Gb or even 128 Gb, but this is required in very few situations like heavy CAT applications or video editing.\n We are currently using 64-bit processors, but usually, the bus is not 64 bits. More like 40-bit or 48-bit. This characteristic still has the possibility to improve.\n Going to a 128-bit CPU from a 64-bit one will require more memory. We will need a huge cache size. Otherwise, the program will just run slowlier.\n It will require a lot more power. Such a processor will be significantly bigger in size and it will release more heat too. This can be very impractical. Literally nobody wants bigger and heavier devices.\n The price per wat will also be too expensive. It will be far costlier to create a 128-bit CPU.\n Another disadvantage will be the need for a 128-bit OS and drivers. It will be pointless if such a processor can\u2019t be properly utilized. For now neither Microsoft nor Apple are even thinking of creating such an OS.\n One of the executives of ARM stated that the company \u201chas no plans for 128-bit ARM-based chips because they simply aren\u2019t needed.\u201d\n Surely one day, after many, many years we will start using 128-bits processors, but obviously, it won\u2019t be soon.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 04:30:02", "source_domain":

criteria for the adoption of the currency.\n Previous roadmap required that all member countries met three primary criteria for the adoption of the currency.\n That included member countries having a budget deficit of not more than 3 percent; average annual inflation of less than 10 percent with a long-term goal of not more than 5 percent.\n Countries were expected to also have gross reserves that can finance at least three months of imports.\n  The other convergence criteria that was adopted by ECOWAS was public debt or Gross Domestic Product of not more than 70 percent.\n There was also the issue of central banks financing budget deficit not more than 10 percent of previous year\u2019s tax revenue, and nominal exchange rate variation of plus or minus 10 percent.\n Majority of the member

", "note_en": "The city of Stockton, California, embarked on a bold experiment two years ago: It decided to distribute  $500 a month to 125 people for 24 months \u2014 with no strings attached and no work requirements. The people were randomly chosen from neighborhoods at or below the city\u2019s median household income, and they were free to spend the money any way they liked. Meanwhile, researchers studied what impact the cash had on their lives.\n The  results from the first year of the experiment, which spanned from February 2019 to February 2020, are now in. And they\u2019re extremely encouraging for its participants, and for advocates who see unconditional cash transfers as an effective way to help people escape poverty.\n The most eye-popping finding is that the people who received the cash managed to secure full-time jobs at more than twice the rate of people in a control group, who did not receive cash.  Within a year, the proportion of cash recipients who had full-time jobs jumped from 28 percent to 40 percent. The control group saw only a 5 percent jump over the same period.\n The researchers  wrote in their report that the money gave recipients the stability they needed to set goals, take risks, and find new jobs. One man in his 30s had been eligible for a real estate license for over a year but hadn\u2019t gotten it because he just couldn\u2019t afford to take time off work. Thanks to the freedom offered by the extra $500 per month, he said, his life was \u201cconverted 360 degrees \u2026 because I have more time and net worth to study \u2026 to achieve my goals.\u201d\n  Critics of cash assistance programs often  say that handing out \u201cfree money\u201d will make people less inclined to find jobs. But in the research done to date, unconditional cash does not tend to disincentivize work. In several programs \u2014 from Alaska and North Carolina in the US, to  Finland and Spain in Europe \u2014 it has had no effect on employment either way. In some cases, it seems to embolden people with an entrepreneurial bent; for instance, in Japan,  initial survey results have shown that recipients are 3.9 times more interested in launching a new business.\n Employment aside, there are clear benefits to unconditional cash programs. The Stockton experiment \u2014 which was conducted as a randomized controlled trial and underwent an independent evaluation \u2014 adds to the growing body of evidence from  basic income experiments around the world, which shows that getting unconditional cash tends to boost  happiness,  health,  school attendance, and  trust in social institutions, while  reducing crime.\n   There were other benefits from the Stockton program. Cash recipients reported being less anxious and depressed than the control group. On average, the recipients \u201cexperienced clinically and statistically significant improvements in their mental health that the control group did not \u2014 moving from likely having a mild mental health disorder to likely mental wellness over the year-long intervention,\u201d according to the researchers.\n The cash also  enabled recipients to help their family and friends. For example, one woman used the cash to help her siblings buy school clothes for their kids and to help her daughter-in-law pay for car insurance. Another bought diapers for her grandchildren.\n This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen cash programs have positive ripple effects on the broader community. In Kenya, cash transfers have stimulated the economy and   benefited not only the recipients themselves but also people in nearby villages.\n It\u2019s worth noting a wrinkle in the Stockton trial:  Each participant was given $500 per month on a debit card so that researchers would be able to see how they were using the money. However, 40 percent of it was either withdrawn as cash or transferred to an existing bank account, so researchers had to rely on participants to tell them where the money went.\n Of the money tracked on the debit cards, recipients spent most on necessities like food (37 percent), home goods and clothes (22 percent), utilities (11 percent), and car costs (10 percent). They spent less than 1 percent on alcohol or cigarettes.\n Though these numbers can\u2019t capture the full picture, they offer a counter to harmful stereotypes and faulty assumptions: that people who become poor get that way because they\u2019re bad at rational decision-making and self-control, and that they\u2019ll blow free money on frivolous things or addictive substances. The  evidence  does not support these beliefs.\n The Stockton experiment was a small study with only 125 cash recipients, so the findings should be seen as offering supporting evidence on the effectiveness of cash programs rather than as definitive standalone proof. Nevertheless,  the results of this philanthropically funded program \u2014 officially known as the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED), which received a $1 million grant from the Economic Security Project \u2014 help underscore that poverty is a lack of cash, not character, and usefully add to the body of evidence that free money doesn\u2019t disincentivize employment \u2014 it can actually boost it.\n   The message that free money can actually improve job prospects comes at a critical moment, as the  Biden administration tries to push through a pandemic aid package that would include direct checks to millions of Americans.\n The pandemic has made the idea of direct payments more popular. With the Covid-19 crisis generating so much financial loss and uncertainty, advocates have argued that citizens desperately need some sort of income floor. And against this backdrop, SEED has spawned something much bigger:  Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, a  coalition of mayors who are pushing for the US to implement a federal guaranteed income. Both SEED and the mayoral  coalition are the brainchild of Michael Tubbs, the former mayor of Stockton.\n For years now, Tubbs has promoted the idea that a guaranteed income could transform life for Stockton residents, but he\u2019s also made clear this experiment is about a lot more than just his city. \u201cStockton is a proxy for America: its diversity, its people,\u201d he  said. \u201cIt\u2019s a place that\u2019s emerging and has big, bold ideas.\u201d\n Guaranteed income is a big, bold idea that could improve life for millions of Americans if implemented more widely. That said, it\u2019s not a cure-all for the systemic obstacles that keep people from a healthy, stable life.\n As the SEED researchers wrote in their report, \u201cGuaranteed income should not be considered as a singular approach for household stability, but rather as one policy option to be implemented alongside others to shore up market failures.\u201d Other policy options include increasing the supply of affordable housing and raising the minimum wage.\n For now, only the first year\u2019s worth of data from the Stockton experiment is available; we have to wait until 2022 for the full results. But the first-year findings signal that guaranteed income programs \u2014 combined with better public policy \u2014 could go a long way toward fighting poverty.\n   Millions turn to Vox to understand what\u2019s happening in the news.

", "note_en": "I recently spent some time going through the amazing nand2tetris course, and assignment #9 is to implementsomething with the Jack programming language that runs on the Hack computer. Myfriend encouraged me to try writing a raytracer, which is an algorithm thatgenerates physically realistic images by simulating light bouncing off ofobjects. The output of the raytracer is a beautiful image with shadows,reflections, and other physical phenomena. Implementing a raytracer requires abit of math and linear algebra, and it seemed like a fun challenge to writesomething complex with the limited capabilities of the Jack\u00a0language.\n I\u2019d like to share my approach and the challenges I faced reimplementing my ownmath system and optimizing a Jack program with limited tools. Though you maynever need to do this, you might learn a lot about how computers perform math,and gain an appreciation for math\u00a0libraries!\n  First, I looked at what the Jack language had to offer. I knew that debuggingwould be really challenging, so I was looking for how easy it would be to debug,print logging statements, and set\u00a0breakpoints.\n The answer was: not very easy. The system has a 512x256 black and white screen,and when you use  Output.printString to print stuff to it, it\u2019s emitted ontothe screen, not to a separate terminal, and it doesn\u2019t scroll very well. You canset breakpoints, but it\u2019s a little tricky to step into and out of functions. Forexample, here\u2019s printing \u201cHello world\u201d to the\u00a0screen.\n  This, along with performance concerns, led me to consider writing a testimplementation of the raytracer, so that I could practice the implementation,iterate quickly, and get it working before translating it to Jack. I chose Rustfor this because I\u2019ve always wanted to learn Rust, and because it seemed like agood fit. Rust has precise control over copying semantics and int sizes,automatic memory management, immutability-first coding, and handy features likeoverflow detection for\u00a0ints.\n  To write the Rust raytracer, I mostly followed this awesome blog postwith some simplifications and modifications for the Hack computer. Since it hasa 512x256 black and white screen (no grayscale), the output fidelity is prettylimited, so I chose not to implement the fancier stuff like reflections, sinceit wouldn\u2019t be very visible anyways. Secondly, I only needed to do all colorcomputations in a single channel, since I don\u2019t have colors. Finally, I knew I\u2019dneed some sort of  dithering algorithmto convert the grayscale output of the raytracer into black and white pixels ina nice-looking\u00a0way.\n You\u2019d think I\u2019d just be able to follow the tutorial, make these changes, rendera beautiful image, and start working on this blog post, but that wasn\u2019t thecase. First, I had to solve an arguably even harder problem: the fact that Jackhas no decimal point type, only whole integers. Furthermore, the only numbertype that Jack supports is a signed 16-bit integer ( i16 in Rust), which storesvalues from -32768 to 32767. This.. is not very big. Put it this way: you canoverflow this value by multiplying 200 by\u00a0200.\n In order to implement a raytracer, you need a fairly complete math library,including multiplication, division, square roots, and \u03c0. Jack has  Math.sqrt,but it only works on the native  int type and truncates to the nearest  int.\n Of course, Rust has all the math functions I need, but it wouldn\u2019t be a verygood test implementation if I used Rust-specific functions. Therefore, I neededto use only the parts of Rust that exist in Jack, and implement the new partsmyself in order to port them to\u00a0Jack.\n So, before writing a single line of raytracer code, I needed to write my ownnumerical type that was big enough to support the range and precision I wanted.I decided to break this into two steps: implementing a big enough  Int class,then implementing a decimal point type on top of it using fixed-point arithmetic.\n  The idea behind fixed point arithmetic is that you can use some storage to storedata after the decimal point. Switching to standard base 10 for a second,consider a scenario where I only have 5 digits for storage. I can either use itto store 0 to 99999, or I could mentally insert a decimal point after the thirddigit, which lets me store 0 to 999.99. In this case, I have three digits ofrange and two digits of precision. To actually store the data, I multiply by100, which is known as the scaling factor because you store  X * 100 torepresent  X: 34832 for 348.32, etc. When the scaling factor is 100, theprecision is 0.01, because your system\u2019s smallest increment is in steps of 0.01,and anything smaller is\u00a0lost.\n  When the scaling factor is higher, you can store higher-precision decimals, butyou lose overall range. For example, with a scaling factor of 1000, which meansyou store 34832 for 34.832, you now have three digits of decimals, but only twodigits before the decimal point, so your range is now only 0\u201199.\n The overall idea idea is that you have to allocate your five digits to eitherstoring pre- or post- decimal point digits, and it\u2019s a tradeoff between rangeand precision. I\u2019ll go into this more\u00a0later!\n  Returning to building the  Int class, the main technique for doing this is tostore an array of integers. The first integer is the least significant chunk,the next one is the next significant chunk, etc. It\u2019s just like the way one usesdigits to express larger\u00a0numbers.\n   In my Rust implementation, I use  i16s (signed 16-bit integers) for everyinteger, because I wanted to simulate the equivalent Jack type  int.\n   This is a struct with an array of four  i16s. I called it  Int32 because Ithought a signed 32-bit integer would be enough range to support all the math Ineeded. It needs to support decimals in the future, and as mentioned above, Ineed to allocate these 32 bits to store data either before or after the decimalpoint. I\u2019ll go into this more in the next section. For now, we only need toconcern ourselves for implementing math on this  Int32 class.\n You might notice that I seem to have more data than I need: an array of four i16s is 64 bits of information, not 32. This is true. I deliberately left thetop eight bits of each  i16 empty, which means that each  i16 is in the rangeof  [0, 255]. I did this for a few\u00a0reasons:\n I\u2019ll need to use  i16 math to implement  Int32 math, and it\u2019s really helpfulto have some room for overflow. For example, if I use the entire  i16 range,and eventually add 30000 to 5000, it will overflow and wrap around to -30534,which is not desirable. Instead, if I only use the \u201cbottom\u201d half of the  i16,which stores 0 to 255, I can add 200 to 100 and get 300, then manually handlethe overflow myself.\n Jack has no unsigned integer, which makes the math troublesome. Most of thealgorithms that I\u2019m about to use only work on unsigned integers. Rather thantrying to make them work with signed integers, I decided to artificially limitthe size to pretend I had an unsigned integer. In other words, I can use a i16 to pretend to be a  u8 (unsigned 8-bit integer), because the range [0, 255] fits comfortably inside the range  [-32768, 32767].\n Assuming I don\u2019t use the top eight bits of each  i16, then each  i16contributes eight bits, and  8 * 4 = 32. Yay! Let\u2019s start working on the\u00a0math.\n  Most systems store negative numbers using a technique called two\u2019s complement. If you havean unsigned 3-bit integer, as you count from  000 to  111, the integers gofrom 0 to 7. But for a signed 3-bit integer stored as two\u2019s complement, as youcount from  000 to  111, the integers go from 0 to 3, then wrap around to -4,then count up to -1. This slices the available range in half, but allows you tostore negative\u00a0numbers!\n   Addition and subtraction \u201cjust work\u201d with positive and negative numberswithout having to do anything special. For example, 2 (010) + -4 (100) = 110, which corresponds to -2.\n It\u2019s easy to see if a number is negative: check if the most significant bit(farthest to the left) is 1.\n To implement negation in 2\u2019s complement, flip all the bits and add one. Here\u2019swhat that looks\u00a0like:\n pub   fn  do_neg( &amp; mut  self)  {    // Flip each integer. We need to AND with 0xFF to get rid of all the    // bits past the 8th bit, because those bits always need to be 0.   self.parts[ 0]   =   !self.parts[ 0]   &amp;   0xFF;   self.parts[ 1]   =   !self.parts[ 1]   &amp;   0xFF;   self.parts[ 2]   =   !self.parts[ 2]   &amp;   0xFF;   self.parts[ 3]   =   !self.parts[ 3]   &amp;   0xFF;     // Add one, and handle carry.   self.parts[ 0]   +=   1;     if  self.parts[ 0]   &gt;=   256  {   self.parts[ 0]   -=   256;   self.parts[ 1]   +=   1;   }     if  self.parts[ 1]   &gt;=   256  {   self.parts[ 1]   -=   256;   self.parts[ 2]   +=   1;   }     if  self.parts[ 2]   &gt;=   256  {   self.parts[ 2]   -=   256;   self.parts[ 3]   +=   1;   }     if  self.parts[ 3]   &gt;=   256  {   self.parts[ 3]   -=   256;   }  }\n You might notice I implemented this as a mutative function, rather thanreturning a new  Int32 with the negative result. This is a deliberate choice toavoid extra allocations. By reusing the same struct, I don\u2019t need to allocatemore memory for every math operation, and I\u2019ll be using these a  lot. Thismight be penny-pinching in Rust, but it was an absolute lifesaver for Jack. Ialso didn\u2019t use Rust\u2019s operator overloading, since Jack doesn\u2019t have\u00a0thatfeature.\n  As mentioned above, addition and subtraction are fairly easy in a two\u2019scomplement world. Like school math, you add each component and carry over to thenext higher chunk if\u00a0needed.\n  pub   fn  do_add( &amp; mut  self,  other:  &amp; Int32)  {   self.parts[ 0]   +=  other.parts[ 0];   self.parts[ 1]   +=  other.parts[ 1];   self.parts[ 2]   +=  other.parts[ 2];   self.parts[ 3]   +=  other.parts[ 3];     if  self.parts[ 0]   &gt;=   256  {   self.parts[ 0]   -=   256;   self.parts[ 1]   +=   1;   }     if  self.parts[ 1]   &gt;=   256  {   self.parts[ 1]   -=   256;   self.parts[ 2]   +=   1;   }     if  self.parts[ 2]   &gt;=   256  {   self.parts[ 2]   -=   256;   self.parts[ 3]   +=   1;   }     if  self.parts[ 3]   &gt;=   256  {   self.parts[ 3]   -=   256;   }  }\n  Remember that  parts[0] is the least significant chunk and  parts[3] is themost significant. This is also an example of how having that extra space in the i16 allows me to add two numbers in the  [0, 255] range without fear of  i16overflow.\n  Here\u2019s where it got trickier. Multiplication can be done just like the schooltechnique, where you multiply each pair of digits and offset\u00a0accordingly.\n  I took the algorithm from this post andadapted it to Rust (and later Jack). However, I ran into two\u00a0issues.\n First, I only adapted the unsigned version of the algorithm for simplicity. Thatmeans I needed to handle signs myself. Luckily, this is not too\u00a0bad:\n If either side was negative (i.e. if  A is negative ^ B is negative = true),negate the result.\n Secondly, I ran into integer sizing problems again during the implementation.The original implementation multiplies  unsigned shorts (or  u16 in Rust), anduses a temporary  unsigned int ( u32) to store the result. This is necessary,because multiplication is a range-expanding operation. For example, if youmultiply any two two-digit numbers, the result will be at most 4 digits. In thesame way, to properly fit the results of  u16 * u16, you need a  u32.\n  This is bad news for us because we only have one size, the  i16. You mightthink we could make this work because we secretly only use the bottom half, asmentioned above. However, even that doesn\u2019t\u00a0work.\n Since we\u2019re using just the bottom half of the  i16, it has a range of [0, 255]. What happens when we multiply 255 by 255? We get 65,025, whichdoesn\u2019t fit in a  i16 (range  [-32768, 32767]). Sad times! This makes sensebecause the  [0, 255] range is represented by the type  u8, and if youmultiply two  u8s, you get a  u16, which has the range  [0, 65535]. All wehave is  i16 (range  [-32768, 32767]), which doesn\u2019t fit :( This is a casewhere having an unsigned integer type in Jack would really help, but alas, we\u00a0donot.\n How do we fix this one? The answer is to subdivide again. Before performing themultiplication algorithm, we expand the array of four 8-bit chunks into eight4-bit chunks. Each 8-bit chunk is split into two 4-bit chunks, one with thelower four bits and one with the higher four\u00a0bits.\n let  self_parts_expanded: [ i16;   8]   =  [   self_parts[ 0]   &amp;   0x0F,   arith_rightshift(self_parts[ 0],   4),   self_parts[ 1]   &amp;   0x0F,   arith_rightshift(self_parts[ 1],   4),   self_parts[ 2]   &amp;   0x0F,   arith_rightshift(self_parts[ 2],   4),   self_parts[ 3]   &amp;   0x0F,   arith_rightshift(self_parts[ 3],   4),  ];\n  Now, we can use our multiplication algorithm on these 4-bit chunks, knowing thata unsigned 4-bit multiplication will result in a  u8, which fits inside our i16.\u00a0Huzzah!\n // Top 12 bits of each i16 should be empty, so read it like a &#34;u4&#34;. // We&#39;re simulating Jack which only has i16.  fn  u4_array_mul_u4_array(u:  &amp;[ i16;   8],  v:  &amp;[ i16;   8])  -&gt; [ i16;   16]  {    let   mut  w   =  [ 0 i16;   16];     for  j   in   0.. 8  {    let   mut  carry   =   0;    let  vj   =  v[j];    for  i   in   0.. 8  {    // Perform signed 16-bit math that will never overflow    // because we only put u4s into it! u4 * u4 = u8, which    // fits in a i16. We can&#39;t do use u8s because u8 * u8 =    // u16 and u16s don&#39;t fit in i16.    let  t   =  u[i]   *  vj   +  w[i   +  j]   +  carry;     // Bottom half of the multiply goes into the result; top    // half becomes carry for the next round.   w[i   +  j]   =  t   &amp;   0x0F;   carry   =  arith_rightshift(t,   4);   }   w[j   +   8]   =  carry;   }    w  }\n The result is generated in 4-bit chunks, so we need to combine each pair backinto one 8-bit chunk, which I won\u2019t show\u00a0here.\n Notice that I use a function to perform the right shift, rather than Rust\u2019snative  &gt;&gt;. This is again because Jack doesn\u2019t have a right shift operator, soI have to implement\u00a0it.\n // Jack doesn&#39;t have these, so we need to reimplement them.  fn  arith_rightshift(x:  i16,  n:  i16)  -&gt;  i16 {    let   mut  r   =  x;     for  _   in   0..n  {    let  divided   =  r   /   2;    // Negative numbers round away from 0, not towards 0.   r   =   if  r   &lt;   0   &amp;&amp;  divided   *   2   !=  r  {   divided   -   1   }   else  {   divided   }   }    r  }\n   Division is similar to multiplication, but a little more complicated. Just likemultiplication, I translated the code from this page. Thegeneral gist is also similar to grade school long division, where you generateeach quotient digit one by one, multiply the quotient digit by the divisor, andsubtract it from the\u00a0dividend.\n  We use the same technique of taking the absolute value before performing thealgorithm and then negating the result if exactly one of the inputs is\u00a0odd.\n As for the overflow issue, we need to break each 8-bit chunk into two 4-bitchunks, just like multiplication. The difference is that multiplication goeslike this:  8 chunks * 8 chunks =&gt; 16 chunks, while division performs theinverse:  16 chunks / 8 chunks = 8 chunks. I won\u2019t show the code here, but itjust means the input and output array sizes are\u00a0different.\n  There are many ways to compute square roots, and most of them involve some sortof converging formula that you run until you have the desired accuracy. I chosethe  Babylonian method forsimplicity. To compute the square root of  x:\n Average  guess and  x / guess to get a closer estimate of the square root,and update  guess.\n All of this is done with integer math, so it\u2019ll find the closest integer\u00a0squareroot.\n   pub   fn  do_sqrt( &amp; mut  self)  {    if  self.is_negative()  {   panic !();   }     if  self.is_zero()  {    return;   }     let   mut  guess   =  Int32::from( 5);    for  _   in   0.. 20  {    let   mut  inv   =   *self;   inv.do_div( &amp;guess);    guess.do_add( &amp;inv);   guess.do_div( &amp;Int32::from( 2));   }    self.parts   =  guess.parts;  }\n For simplicity, I started with a guess of  5 and ran 20 iterations every time.We\u2019ll talk about optimizations\u00a0later.\n Hooray, we finished our  Int32 implementation! You can see the final code here,along with unit tests. Now, we\u2019ll move on to implementing fixed\u2011pointarithmetic.\n  As mentioned above, fixed-point arithmetic involves using a whole number toencode a decimal by multiplying the decimal by a scale factor and storing theresulting\u00a0number.\n  Sometimes, a syntax like  Q15.17 is used to describe this scheme. The  Q15.17format is 32 bits (15 + 17) and uses 15 bits for pre-decimal point data and 17bits for post-decimal point data. For example, the old game Quake used  Q16.16for all of its code because the computers at that time didn\u2019t have fast floatingpoint math\u00a0yet.\n If  Q16.16 was good enough for Quake, it\u2019s probably good enough for me, so Ithought I\u2019d do the same. This means I\u2019ll use 16 bits for post-decimal pointdata, which means the scale factor will be  2^16 = 65536, and I\u2019ll be able tostore a decimal point number from -32768 to 32767, with precisions of 1/65536,or\u00a00.00001525878.\n As a result of this scheme, it happens that the top two  i16s in the  Int32parts array will be for pre-decimal point data, and the bottom two forpost-decimal point\u00a0data.\n  Now, we\u2019ll talk about how to implement fixed-point math, using what we\u00a0builtearlier.\n  To construct a  Number from a regular int, we need to wrap it in a  Int32,then multiply it by the scale\u00a0factor:\n  I wrote a handy function on  Int32 to handle the shift left for us. Shiftingleft by 2 bytes is the same as multiplying by  2^16, the scale\u00a0factor.\n  Addition and subtraction are fairly easy, because adding or subtracting two Numbers that have the same scale factor is as simple as performing theoperation on their backing  Int32s.\n pub   fn  do_add( &amp; mut  self,  other:  &amp; Number)  {   self. 0.do_add( &amp;other. 0);  }    pub   fn  do_sub( &amp; mut  self,  other:  &amp; Number)  {   self. 0.do_sub( &amp;other. 0);  }\n  To multiply two fixed numbers, we can multiply their backing  Int32s. However,the resulting number will have an extra multiply by the scale factor, so we needto divide by the scale factor afterwards to cancel it\u00a0out.\n   This poses a serious issue. If we try to do  2 * 2 in our fixed math, theunderlying  Int32s will perform  131072 * 131072, which will overflow the Int32\u2019s max of 2,147,483,647 ( 2^31 - 1).\n We could consider dividing by the scale factor prior to multiplying, but thishas the serious disadvantage of throwing away all of the post-decimal pointinformation of one of the\u00a0multiplicands.\n  To solve this, I realized that the output of the multiplication function iseight chunks of eight bits, but we can only store the bottom four chunks ofeight bits, so we normally ignore the top four\u00a0chunks.\n  However, if the multiplication function takes a \u201cbytes to right shift\u201d argument,it can read from higher chunks and change the information that is ignored. Forexample, if  right_shift_bytes is  0, it reads from result chunks  0-3. Ifit\u2019s  1, it reads from result chunks  1-4. This technique allows us to fusethe multiply and divide together to avoid losing information in between. Thedivide is accomplished by the right shift, because right shifting the parts by 1is equivalent to dividing by 256 (8\u00a0bits).\n   Conveniently, since we chose a scale factor that aligns with our array scheme,we can pass  2 as  right_shift_bytes and get the desired\u00a0result.\n  Division is similar to multiplication, but we need to multiply by the scalefactor beforehand to avoid an extra scale factor in the\u00a0denominator.\n   But just like multiplication, we can bundle the multiplication with the divisionto avoid loss of precision or overflow. The result is  do_left_shift_bytes_div:\n   Just like multiplication and division, square roots involve performing theunderlying  Int32 operation and correcting the scale factor.

From the perspective of a programmer, SSDs and disks look very similar: both are persistent, enable page-based access through file systems and system calls, and have large capacities.  However, there are also important differences, which become important if one wants to achieve optimal SSD performance. As we will see, SSDs are more complicated and their performance behavior can appear quite mysterious if one simply thinks of them as fast disks. The goal of this post is to provide an understanding of why SSDs behave the way they do, which can help creating software that is capable of exploiting them. (Note that I discuss NAND flash, not Intel Optane memory, which has different characteristics.)\n  SSDs are often referred to as disks, but this is misleading as they store data on semiconductors instead of a mechanical disk. To read or write from a random block, a disk has to mechanically move its head to the right location, which takes on the order of 10ms. A random read from an SSD, in contrast, takes about 100us \u2013 100 times faster. This low read latency is the reason why booting from an SSD is so much faster than booting from a disk.\n  Another important difference between disks and SSDs is that disks have one disk head and perform well only for sequential accesses. SSDs, in contrast, consist of dozens or even hundreds of flash chips (&#34;parallel units&#34;), which can be accessed concurrently.  SSDs transparently stripe larger files across the flash chips at page granularity, and a hardware prefetcher ensures that sequential scans exploit all available flash chips. However, at the flash level there is not much difference between sequential and random reads. Indeed, for most SSDs it is possible to achieve almost the full bandwidth with random page reads as well. To do this, one has to schedule hundreds of random IO requests concurrently in order to keep all flash chips busy. This can be done by starting lots of threads or using asynchronous IO interfaces such as libaio or io_uring.\n  Things get even more interesting with writes. For example, if one looks at write latency, one may measure results as low as 10us \u2013 10 times faster than a read. However, latency only appears so low because SSDs are caching writes on volatile RAM. The actual write latency of NAND flash is about 1ms \u2013 10 times slower than a read. On consumer SSDs, this can be measured by issuing a sync/flush command after the write to ensure that the data is persistent on flash. On most data center/server SSDs, write latency cannot be measured directly: the sync/flush will complete immediately because a battery guarantees persistence of the write cache even in the case of power loss.   To achieve high write bandwidth despite the relatively high write latency, SSDs use the same trick as reads: they access multiple flash chips concurrently. Because the the write cache can asynchronously write pages, it is not even necessary to schedule that many writes simultaneously to get good write performance. However, the write latency cannot always be hidden completely: for example, because a write occupies a flash chip 10 times longer a read, writes cause significant tail latencies for reads to the same flash chip.\n  Our understanding is missing one important fact: NAND flash pages cannot be overwritten. Page writes can only be performed sequentially within blocks that have been erased beforehand. These erase blocks have a size of multiple MB and therefore consist of hundreds of pages. On a new SSD, all blocks are erased, and one can directly start appending new data.  Updating pages, however, is not so easy. It would be too expensive to erase the entire block just to overwrite a single page in-place. Therefore, SSDs perform page updates by writing the new version of the page to a new location. This means that the logical and physical pages addresses are decoupled. A mapping table, which is stored on the SSD, translates logical (software) addresses to physical (flash) locations. This component is also called Flash Translation Layer (FTL).  For example, let&#39;s assume we have a (toy) SSD with 3 erase blocks, each with 4 pages. A sequence of writes to pages P1, P2, P0, P3, P5, P1 may result in the following physical SSD state:\n    Using the mapping table and out-of-place write, everything is good until the SSD runs out of free blocks. The old version of overwritten pages must eventually be reclaimed. If we continue our example from above by writing to pages P3, P4, P7, P1, P6, P2, we get the following situation:    At this point we have no more free erase blocks (even though logically there should still be space). Before one can write another page, the SSD first has to erase a block. In the example, it might be best for the garbage collector to erase block 0, because only one of its pages is still in use. After erasing block 0, we make space for 3 writes and our SSD looks like this:\n  To garbage collect block 0, we had to physically move page P0, even though logically nothing happened with that page. In other words, with flash SSDs the number of physical (flash) writes is generally higher than the number of logical (software) writes. The ratio between the two is called write amplification. In our example, to make space for 3 new pages in block 0, we had to move 1 page. Thus we have 4 physical writes for 3 logical writes, i.e., a write amplification of 1.33.  High write amplification decreases performance and reduces flash lifetime. How large write amplification is depends on the access pattern and how full the SSD is. Large sequential writes have low write amplification, while random writes are the worst case.  Let&#39;s assume our SSD is filled to 50% and we perform random writes. In steady state, wherever we erase a block, about half the pages of that block are still in use and have to be copied on average. Thus, write amplification for a fill factor of 50% is 2. In general, worst-case write amplification for a fill factor f is 1/(1-f):     Because write amplification becomes unreasonably high for fill factors close to 1, most SSDs have hidden spare capacity. This overprovisioning is typically 10-20% of the total capacity. Of course, it is also easy to add more overprovisioning by creating an empty partition and never write to it.\n  SSDs have become quite cheap and they have very high performance. For example, a Samsung PM1733 server SSD costs about 200 EUR per TB and promises close to 7 GB/s read and 4 GB/s write bandwidth. Actually achieving such high performance requires knowing how SSD work and this post described the most important behind-the-scenes mechanisms of flash SSDs.  I tried to keep this post short, which meant that I had to simplify things. To learn more, a good starting point is  this tutorial, which also references some insightful papers. Finally, because SSDs have become so fast, the operating system I/O stack is often the performance bottleneck.
