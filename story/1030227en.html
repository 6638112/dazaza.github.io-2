Novelists will draw from this strange life mysterious and moving episodes (we would add: the legal world will find in the account of the &#34;Sax trial&#34; a vast domain for a case law study) and the moralists will find in it the features of self-denial, physical courage and perseverance, of which only a lifted soul and a great heart are capable.</p><p>1860年，日记作家奥斯卡·科米塔特(Oscar Cometant)写道，在他为音乐艺术提供的服务中，在他不得不经历的将他的发现公之于众并保护它们免受掠夺的战斗中，在他成为所有工业国的奖励对象中，[萨克斯的一生]上升到了社会活动的高度。小说家将从这个奇怪的生活中汲取神秘而感人的情节(我们还要补充一句：法律界将在萨克斯审判的描述中发现判例法研究的广阔领域)，道德家将在其中发现自我否定、身体勇气和毅力的特征，这些特征只有振奋的灵魂和伟大的心灵才能做到。</p><p>        Antoine-Joseph Sax was born in the street that has borne his name since 1896, in a modest house, which was destroyed in 1914, and which was built on the present site of an important commercial building.</p><p>安托万-约瑟夫·萨克斯出生在自1896年以来一直以他的名字命名的街道上，出生在1914年被摧毁的一座不起眼的房子里，这座房子建在一座重要商业建筑的现址上。</p><p>  In its façade, there is a stained-glass window and an inscription chiselled into the stonework: &#34;Adolphe Sax, 1814-1894, was born here&#34;. This window was solemnly inaugurated on 27 June 1954, on the initiative of the Tourist Information Centre, under the mayorship of Mr Léon Sasserath. It is the work of Mr Jean Jadin, who designed the cartoon, and Miss Maggy Arzée. Both were taught by Miss Yvonne Gérard and Mr Perot, teachers of graphic art and decoration at the Fine Arts Academy in Namur, which was then directed by Mr Lambeau. It was created under the direction of Mr Van de Capelle.</p><p>在它的正面，有一扇彩色玻璃窗和刻在石器上的铭文：阿道夫·萨克斯(Adolphe Sax，1814-1894)出生在这里。1954年6月27日，在旅游信息中心的倡议下，在莱昂·萨瑟拉斯市长的领导下，这个窗口隆重揭幕。这是这幅漫画的设计者Jean Jadin先生和Maggy Arzée小姐的作品。两人都是由Yvonne Gérard小姐和Perot先生授课的，她们都是纳穆尔市美术学院的平面艺术和装饰课教师，该学院当时由Lambeau先生执导。它是在Van de Capelle先生的指导下创建的。</p><p>  Son of Charles-Joseph Sax (1791-1865) and Marie-Joseph Masson (1813-1861), Antoine-Joseph was the eldest of eleven children (six boys and five girls, only four of whom survived, the others dying between the ages of 20 and 25).</p><p>安托万-约瑟夫是查尔斯-约瑟夫·萨克斯(Charles-Joseph Sax，1791-1865年)和玛丽-约瑟夫·马森(Marie-Joseph Masson，1813-1861年)的儿子，是11个孩子中的老大(6个男孩和5个女孩，其中只有4个幸存下来，其他人在20岁到25岁之间死亡)。</p><p>  His childhood was tragic. Hardly able to stand, Antoine-Joseph fell from a height of three floors, seriously bumping his head against a stone: he was believed dead. At the age of three, he swallowed a bowl of vitriolized water, and then a pin. Later, he was seriously burned in a gunpowder explosion; he fell onto a cast iron frying pan and burned himself on one side. Three times he escaped poisoning and asphyxiation in his bedroom, where varnished items were lying about during the night. Another time, he was hit on the head by a cobblestone; he fell into a river and was saved by the skin of his teeth.</p><p>他的童年是悲惨的。安托万-约瑟夫几乎无法站立，他从三层楼高坠落，头部严重撞到一块石头上：据信他已经死亡。在他三岁的时候，他吞下了一碗硫酸水，然后吞下了一根大头针。后来，他在一次火药爆炸中被严重烧伤，跌倒在铸铁煎锅上，一侧烧伤。有三次他在卧室里逃脱了中毒和窒息的危险，晚上他的卧室里到处都是清漆的东西。还有一次，他被一块鹅卵石击中头部，掉进河里，死里逃生。</p><p>  &#34; He&#39;s a child condemned to misfortune; he won&#39;t live,&#34; his mother said. In the district, they called him &#34;little Sax, the ghost&#34;.</p><p>他是一个注定要倒霉的孩子；他的母亲说，他活不下去了。在这个地区，他们称他为小萨克斯，鬼魂。</p><p>  These initial serious incidents were, alas, but the prelude to an eventful existence such as only a few have known. In 1858, Adolphe Sax was miraculously saved from a cancer of the lip by a black doctor who knew the properties of certain Indian plants. What would the future have been but for this intervention?</p><p>唉，这些最初的严重事件不过是一个只有少数人知道的多事之秋的前奏。1858年，阿道夫·萨克斯被一位了解某些印度植物特性的黑人医生奇迹般地从唇癌中救了出来。如果没有这次干预，未来会是什么样子？</p><p>        A joiner-cabinetmaker, Charles-Joseph Sax quickly launched himself, with success, into the manufacture of musical instruments. In the &#34;New Street&#34; he ran a large workshop. In this trade, he acquired such a reputation that, in 1815 (his eldest son was only one year old), he also set up a workshop in Brussels (where Antoine-Joseph&#39;s brothers and sisters were to be born), where he was summoned by William I of Orange (we were then under Dutch occupation). The latter appointed him as maker to the Court and entrusted him with the task of supplying suitable instruments to Belgium regimental music corps.</p><p>查尔斯-约瑟夫·萨克斯(Charles-Joseph Sax)是一名细木细木工，他很快就成功地投身到乐器制造领域。在新街，他经营着一个很大的车间。在这一行业中，他获得了如此大的声誉，以至于在1815年(他的大儿子只有一岁)，他还在布鲁塞尔(安托万-约瑟夫的兄弟姐妹将在那里出生)设立了一个作坊，在那里他被奥兰治的威廉一世(当时我们处于荷兰占领下)召唤。后者任命他为宫廷的制作人，并委托他为比利时团音乐团提供合适的乐器。</p><p>  A self-taught man, therefore, Charles-Joseph Sax made woodwind and brass instruments, even violins and pianos. He registered a dozen patents and brought his instruments to perfection. He successfully participated in numerous exhibitions, where he was awarded flattering distinctions.</p><p>因此，查尔斯-约瑟夫·萨克斯是一个自学成才的人，他制作木管乐器和铜管乐器，甚至小提琴和钢琴。他注册了十几项专利，并使他的仪器变得完美。他成功地参加了许多展览，在那里他被授予了奉承的荣誉。</p><p>  At the time when he could have spend the day playing, laughing and having fun, Antoine-Joseph observed the work in his father&#39;s workshop, besides being given instruction by one of his uncles, a teacher in Dinant. He was intelligent and his inventive mind was already showing itself, thanks to his love for music (whilst very young, he took singing and flute lessons). Thereafter, he was given lessons by his father, who quickly appreciated his abilities and did all he could to develop them.</p><p>当安托万-约瑟夫本可以整天玩耍、大笑和玩乐的时候，他在父亲的工作室里观察工作，除了接受他的一位叔叔的指导，他的叔叔是迪南特的一名教师。他很聪明，他的创造性思维已经显现出来，这要归功于他对音乐的热爱(很小的时候，他就上过歌唱和长笛课程)。此后，他的父亲给他上课，父亲很快欣赏了他的能力，并尽其所能发展这些能力。</p><p>  Far from disregarding his son&#39;s aspirations, Charles-Joseph Sax made him his apprentice and, from a young age, he was conscious of the importance of his work, as though he were anticipating his destiny.</p><p>查尔斯-约瑟夫·萨克斯非但没有忽视儿子的抱负，反而让他当他的学徒，从很小的时候起，他就意识到工作的重要性，就好像他在预见自己的命运。</p><p>  In 1853, after the death of seven of his eleven children, and following financial worries at his Brussels business, Charles-Joseph joined his son in Paris. The master was to become the servant, and was from then on in charge of making saxophones until his death in 1865.</p><p>1853年，查尔斯·约瑟夫的11个孩子中有7个去世后，由于他在布鲁塞尔的生意陷入了财务困境，查尔斯-约瑟夫在巴黎与他的儿子团聚。主人将成为仆人，并从那时起负责制作萨克斯管，直到1865年去世。</p><p>        Supported and assisted by his father, the youth worked. He created, he perfected instruments and he played them. He was 16 when he went to the Industrial Exposition in Brussels to present flutes and ivory clarinets. At the age of 20, he made an entirely new clarinet, with 24 keys, a work of imagination and a masterpiece of manual work. Then, a new bass clarinet, which incited enthusiasm in Habeneck, the leader of the orchestra at the Paris Opera House, who was passing through Brussels, and who called the other clarinets &#34;barbarian instruments&#34;.</p><p>在他父亲的支持和帮助下，这个年轻人工作了。他创造了，他完善了乐器，他演奏了它们。当他16岁时，他去布鲁塞尔的工业博览会展示长笛和象牙单簧管。20岁时，他制作了一只全新的单簧管，有24个键，是一件想象力很强的作品，也是一件手工杰作。然后，一种新的低音单簧管激起了哈贝内克的热情，他是巴黎歌剧院管弦乐队的领队，途经布鲁塞尔，他称其他单簧管为野蛮乐器。</p><p>  Even at that early stage, this creation provoked jealousy in the soloist at the &#34;Great Royal Harmony&#34; in Brussels, who refused to use it because, he said, it had come from &#34;that weedy little pupil, Sax&#34;. &#34;Play your clarinet, then&#34; Sax answered, &#34; and I shall play mine.&#34; The challenge accepted, Sax triumphed in front of four thousand people. He became a soloist. Works were written for him that, after his departure, were no longer played because they were so difficult!</p><p>甚至在早期阶段，这件作品就在布鲁塞尔皇家大同剧院的独奏者中引起了嫉妒，他说，因为它出自杂草丛生的小学生萨克斯之手，所以拒绝使用。吹你的单簧管，然后萨克斯回答说，我来吹我的。接受了挑战，萨克斯在四千人面前取得了胜利。他成了一名独奏家。作品是为他写的，在他离开后，不再播放了，因为它们太难了！</p><p>  The young genius pursued his work. He invented a sound reflector, a new double-bass clarinet, a piano-tuning process that remained the inventor&#39;s secret and who probably was unable to exploit it for want of money, a steam organ &#34;capable of being heard throughout the province&#34;: now that just shows Sax&#39;s tendency to think big!</p><p>这位年轻的天才继续他的工作。他发明了一种声音反射器，一种新的低音单簧管，一种仍然是发明者秘密的钢琴调音工艺，他可能因为缺钱而无法利用它，一种能够在全省范围内听到的蒸汽琴：现在这正好显示了萨克斯的远大思想倾向！</p><p>  Sax&#39;s beginnings throw a very curious light on his character (we shall call him Adolphe from now on): energy, courage, dynamism, total self-confidence. He refused to go and set up a business in St Petersburg, rejected an offer to set up in London. That means that his reputation exceeded frontiers. Sax was conscious of all his possibilities and his talent; he conceived the work that he felt the call to achieve; he was full of hope and he believed he had every chance of success; he had great visions, he believed in what he saw. He suffocated in his little country.</p><p>萨克斯的开始给他的性格(从现在起我们将叫他阿道夫)提供了一个非常奇怪的光：能量，勇气，活力，完全的自信。他拒绝去圣彼得堡创业，拒绝了在伦敦设立公司的提议。这意味着他的声誉超越了国界。萨克斯意识到他所有的可能性和才华；他构思了他感觉到实现的呼唤的工作；他充满希望，他相信自己有每一个成功的机会；他有远见，他相信他所看到的。他在他的小国窒息而死。</p><p>  In 1840, he presented nine inventions at the Belgian Exhibition. He was denied the first medal on the plea of his young age; there would be nothing left to offer him the year after. He was thwarted in his true-love, if not in his pride. He refused the vermeil medal he was awarded, replying with pride, &#34; If they think me too young to deserve the gold medal, I myself think me too old to accept this vermeil one.&#34;</p><p>1840年，他在比利时展览会上展示了九项发明。他年轻的时候被拒绝了第一枚奖牌；第二年就没有什么可以提供给他的了。如果不是在他的骄傲上，他的真爱也会受挫。他拒绝了他被授予的朱红色奖牌，自豪地回答说，如果他们认为我太年轻而不配获得金牌，我自己也认为我太老了，不能接受这枚朱红色奖牌。</p><p>        The composer Halévy wrote to him of the hope that composers had in his inventions: &#34; Hurry and finish your new family of instruments (saxophones) and come and succour to the poor composers that are looking for something new and to the public that is demanding it, if not to the world itself.&#34;</p><p>作曲家哈莱维写信给他，希望作曲家们对他的发明抱有希望：快点完成你的新乐器(萨克斯管)家族，来帮助那些正在寻找新东西的可怜的作曲家和需要它的公众，如果不是世界本身的话。</p><p>  Let us add to this call and the snub in Brussels the fact of his family trials, and the decision was made: Adolphe Sax left for Paris &#34;rich in ideas and light in cash&#34;: he had thirty francs in his pocket!</p><p>让我们在这通电话和布鲁塞尔的冷落中再加上他的家庭审判的事实，决定是：阿道夫·萨克斯离开了巴黎&富有的想法和轻薄的现金&他口袋里有30法郎！</p><p>  The year 1842 formed the turning point in Sax&#39;s life, possessing as he did his new invention: the saxophone and its family.</p><p>1842年形成了萨克斯一生的转折点，就像他拥有他的新发明一样：萨克斯管及其家族。</p><p>  Moreover, in 1841, had he not presented it anonymously in Brussels, behind a curtain, so as not to disclose it and avoid the risk of plagiarism?</p><p>此外，在1841年，他不是在布鲁塞尔的幕后匿名提交了这份报告，以免泄露，避免被抄袭的风险吗？</p><p>  Adolphe Sax was almost thirty, &#34;the age at which man&#39;s creative character affirms itself, at which the human personality is drawn.&#34; At the age of 27, Napoleon won his first battle in Italy; Newton was 24 and Einstein 26 when they devised their theories. Mozart died aged 35 and Schubert at 31. Examples of precocious geniuses are manifold.</p><p>阿道夫·萨克斯(Adolphe Sax)快30岁了，这是人的创造性品格得到肯定的年龄，也是人的个性被描绘出来的年龄。27岁时，拿破仑在意大利赢得了他的第一场战斗；牛顿和爱因斯坦分别在24岁和26岁时提出了他们的理论。莫扎特去世，享年35岁，舒伯特去世，享年31岁。早熟天才的例子多种多样。</p><p>  As one former inhabitant of Dinant once rightfully said (1) &#34; a distinction has to be drawn here between a man who draws from his own abstract thoughts the stuff that his genius will knead, him for whom symbols and signs are sufficient to bring forth a thought laden with restrained life and latent splendours; and the other man for whom a technique, slow and tenacious apprenticeship on a complicated apparatus is necessary for him to be able to physically achieve the formal idea. Count, for example, how many early-developing mathematicians there are compared with child physicists. The former exist, the latter are nowhere to be found. Sax is of the category of intellectuals that concentrated on matter and not pure form&#34;.</p><p>正如迪南特的一位前居民曾经正确地说过的那样，这里必须区分一个人，一个人从自己的抽象思维中汲取他的天才将揉成的东西，一个人的符号和符号足以为他带来一种充满克制生活和潜在辉煌的思想，另一个人需要在复杂的机器上接受缓慢而顽强的技术学徒，才能在身体上实现正式的想法。例如，数一数有多少初出茅庐的数学家与儿童物理学家相比。前者存在，后者却无处可寻。萨克斯是一种专注于物质而不是纯粹形式的知识分子。</p><p>  In 1842, there was Adolphe Sax living in a simple shed in Rue Saint-Georges, Paris. To set up business, he had to borrow money from a musician acquaintance.</p><p>1842年，阿道夫·萨克斯住在巴黎圣乔治街的一间简陋小屋里。为了创业，他不得不向一位音乐家熟人借钱。</p><p>      About the saxophone, he said &#34; Its principal merit in my view is the varied beauty of its accent, sometimes serious, sometimes calm, sometimes impassioned, dreamy or melancholic, or vague, like the weakened echo of an echo, like the indistinct plaintiff moans of the breeze in the woods and, even better, like the mysterious vibrations of a bell, long after it has been struck; there does not exist another musical instrument that I know of that possesses this strange resonance, which is situated at the edge of silence.&#34;</p><p>谈到萨克斯管，他说，在我看来，萨克斯管的主要优点是它的口音多种多样，时而严肃，时而平静，时而激情，或梦幻或忧郁，或模糊，像回声的微弱回声，像树林中微风的模糊原告呻吟，更好的是，像钟声敲响很久之后的神秘振动；据我所知，没有另一种乐器具有这种奇怪的共鸣，它位于寂静的边缘。</p><p>  In June 1842, through a contact with Halévy, Sax met Hector Berlioz, who had a lot of influence in Parisian musicians&#39; circles, especially through his criticisms in the</p><p>1842年6月，通过与哈莱维的一次接触，萨克斯认识了赫克托·柏辽兹，他在巴黎音乐界有很大的影响力，特别是通过他在巴黎音乐界的批评。</p><p>  &#34;Journal des Débats&#34;. The two men talked for several hours, during which Adolphe Sax laid out all his ideas to the great composer and went into long details about his inventions and his plans.</p><p>“德巴茨周刊”(Journal des Débats&#34；)。两人交谈了几个小时，在此期间，阿道夫·萨克斯向这位伟大的作曲家阐述了他所有的想法，并详细介绍了他的发明和计划。</p><p>  Somewhat whimsical, very uncommunicative, Berlioz listened in silence. At the end of this conference, he confided in Sax, &#34;Tomorrow, you will know what I think about the work you have accomplished.&#34; This was a rather ambiguous reply, which, for the first time in his life, gave rise to some doubt in Sax&#39;s mind.</p><p>柏辽兹有点异想天开，非常沉默寡言，静静地听着。在这次会议结束时，他向萨克斯吐露了心声，明天，你就会知道我对你所完成工作的看法。这是一个相当模棱两可的回答，这是他有生以来第一次在萨克斯心中引起一些怀疑。</p><p>  On 12 June 1842, in the &#34;Journal des Débats&#34;, a great surprise awaited him: over a number of columns, Berlioz expressed limitless eulogies. The article was reproduced in the French and Belgian press.</p><p>1842年6月12日，在“德巴茨日报”上，一个巨大的惊喜等待着他：在几篇专栏文章中，柏辽兹表达了无限的悼念。这篇文章被法国和比利时媒体转载。</p><p>  For Sax, it was the start of a prolific and prodigious life, which was at the same time tormented. The price he would have to pay would be envy, jealousy, injustice, hatred and adversity before achieving glory much later.</p><p>对萨克斯来说，这是一个多产而丰富多彩的生活的开始，同时也是痛苦的。他将不得不付出的代价是羡慕、嫉妒、不公正、仇恨和逆境，然后很久之后才能获得荣耀。</p><p>  From that moment on, the inventor/composer/performer was introduced throughout the musical world. He met frequently with numerous composers, who had faith in him. He was received at the salons. He gave numerous performances in front of the biggest of names, in his workshop and in halls. Sax&#39;s name was widely known.</p><p>从那一刻起，发明家/作曲家/表演家被介绍到整个音乐界。他经常会见许多对他有信心的作曲家。他在沙龙受到接待。他在他的工作室和大厅里，在最著名的人物面前进行了无数次的表演。萨克斯的名字广为人知。</p><p>    Essentially, Sax gave his name to four great families of instruments: saxhorns, saxtrombones, saxtubas and saxophones. For the first time, a maker had interests in more than just a single instrument, but in a family of instruments. The saxophone family comprised seven instruments from the sopranino and soprano to the bass and double bass, via the alto, tenor and baritone. These instruments bring an entirely new and seductive timbre in a new form, of brass and not of wood. This form, which was discovered and adopted by Sax, is a parabolic cone. The instrument is played with reed, which imitates the sounds of a deep, bowed instrument. Therein lies the entire technical secret of the saxophone. Thus, Sax&#39;s knowledge of the principles of proportion ensured him undeniable superiority over all the other makers.</p><p>基本上，萨克斯将他的名字赋予了四大乐器家族：萨克斯号、萨克斯管、萨克斯大号和萨克斯管。第一次，制造者不仅对一种乐器感兴趣，而且对一系列乐器感兴趣。萨克斯管家族由七种乐器组成，从女高音和女高音到男低音和低音，通过女高音、男高音和男中音。这些乐器带来了一种全新的、诱人的音色，以一种新的形式，是黄铜的，而不是木头的。萨克斯发现并采用的这种形式是抛物线锥体。乐器是用簧片演奏的，它模仿深弓乐器的声音。这就是萨克斯管的全部技术秘密。因此，萨克斯对比例原则的了解确保了他比所有其他制作人都具有不可否认的优势。</p><p>  And this was precisely the main source of the multiple disappointments of this inventor, who had become used to challenge. It was only on 21 March 1846 that he patented the saxophone that he had already been playing for four years, if not longer, and which had been designed in 1838. In the face of the attacks to which he was subjected, and perhaps somewhat naively, he launched a challenge to his enemies and competitors: &#34; I shall wait another year before registering this patent. We shall see whether, by then, a maker will have produced a true saxophone!&#34; The challenge went unanswered and Sax kept his promise.</p><p>而这恰恰是这位已经习惯挑战的发明家多次失望的主要原因。直到1846年3月21日，他才申请了萨克斯管的专利，他已经演奏了四年，如果不是更长的话，而且是在1838年设计的。面对他受到的攻击，他向他的敌人和竞争对手发起了挑战，也许有些天真：在注册这项专利之前，我还会再等一年。我们将拭目以待，到那时，是否会有制造商生产出真正的萨克斯管！&#34；挑战没有得到回应，萨克斯信守了他的诺言。</p><p>    The years that followed were to be awful for the inventor, who was to have to face up to the battle that his adversaries, his competitors and imitators waged against him and pushed to the extreme, who all organised themselves into a club to fight him. His staff were enticed away; musicians were prevented from using his instruments; disparaging articles were published, accompanied by hurtful caricatures. Saxophones were exported with the trade mark obliterated and then openly reintroduced to France after a few alterations and sealed with new seals. Sax was attacked before the courts to have his patents revoked.</p><p>接下来的几年对这位发明家来说是可怕的，他不得不面对他的对手、竞争对手和模仿者对他发动的战斗，并将他们推到了极致，他们都组织成了一个俱乐部来对抗他。他的员工被引诱走了；音乐家被禁止使用他的乐器；发表了贬低他的文章，伴随着伤害性的漫画。萨克斯管被出口，商标被抹去，经过几次改装后公开重新引入法国，并用新的印章密封。萨克斯在法庭上受到攻击，要求撤销他的专利。</p><p>  It would take a book to relate all the court cases that were raised at all levels of jurisdiction. Sax won them all, not without claiming compensation, right until the final acknowledgement.</p><p>需要一本书才能将所有在各级司法管辖区提出的法庭案件联系起来。SAX赢得了所有的胜利，不是在没有要求赔偿的情况下，直到最后的确认。</p><p>  All these court cases ruined Sax, and he was declared bankrupt three times, in 1852, 1873 and 1877. And despite this, with approximately a hundred workers, some twenty thousand instruments left Sax&#39;s workshops between 1843 and 1860!</p><p>所有这些法庭案件都毁了萨克斯，他在1852年、1873年和1877年三次被宣布破产。尽管如此，在1843年到1860年间，大约有100名工人离开了萨克斯的车间，留下了大约2万台仪器！</p><p>  These disappointments, which also ruined Sax&#39;s health, induced Berlioz to write, &#34; Again and again, Sax is the victim of persecutions worthy of the Middle Ages and that recall precisely the acts and deeds of Benveuto Cellini, the Florentine engraver. They took away his workmen, stole his plans, accused him of madness and took him to court. With a little more audacity, they would have murdered him. (1) Such is the hatred that inventors always waken amongst those of their rivals that do not invent anything.&#34;</p><p>这些失望也毁了萨克斯的健康，促使柏辽兹一次又一次地写道，萨克斯是堪称中世纪的迫害的受害者，这恰恰让人想起佛罗伦萨雕刻家贝韦托·切里尼的行为和事迹。他们带走了他的工人，窃取了他的计划，指控他疯了，并将他告上了法庭。再厚颜无耻一点，他们就会杀了他。(1)这就是一种仇恨，以至于发明家总是在那些没有发明任何东西的竞争对手中唤醒他们。</p><p>      One of the great exploits of the genius from Dinant, one of his greatest victories, as well, was the reform of military music corps. In 1845, French military music corps had fallen into disuse. On the proposal of Adolphe Sax, who offered them his instruments, General de Rumigny, the Minister for War, appointed a study commission, which decided to organise a competition between the traditional system and Sax&#39;s configuration.</p><p>迪南特天才的伟大功绩之一，也是他最伟大的胜利之一，就是军乐团的改革。1845年，法国军乐团已经废弃。在阿道夫·萨克斯(Adolphe Sax)的提议下，战争部长德鲁米尼将军(General De Rumigny)任命了一个研究委员会，决定在传统系统和萨克斯的配置之间组织一场比赛。阿道夫·萨克斯向他们提供了自己的乐器。</p><p>  A great event was organised on the Champ de Mars (the present location of the Eiffel Tower) on 22 April 1845. The old system was championed by 45 professional musicians directed by Carafa. Sax championed his own with 38 musicians that he was hardly able to gather, since seven of them had failed to turn up. In addition, he himself had to play two instruments alternately, since two performers turned their backs on him at the last minute!</p><p>1845年4月22日，在火星香榭丽舍(埃菲尔铁塔的现在位置)举办了一场盛大的活动。旧的体系由45名专业音乐家倡导，由卡拉法执导。萨克斯与38位他几乎无法召集的音乐家一起捍卫了自己的音乐家，因为其中7位没有出现。此外，他自己也不得不交替演奏两种乐器，因为有两名表演者在最后一刻背弃了他！</p><p>  An audience of twenty thousand applauded Sax! It was a triumph and on 10 August that year, Sax&#39;s organisation was officially adopted, but not without provoking new hostilities on the part of the musicians who had been beaten.</p><p>两万名观众为萨克斯鼓掌！这是一次胜利，在那一年8月10日，萨克斯的组织被正式采纳，但并不是没有激起被殴打的音乐家们新的敌意。</p><p>      The list of the inventions and perfections that Sax accomplished is very long. Apart from the families of instruments already quoted, mention has to be made of reforms to musical notation, compositions, musical methods (Sax became a teacher for military musicians at the Paris Conservatory directed by Auber), a pamphlet on the influence of wind instruments on the lungs, a planned applied school for inventors, a plan for reorganising orchestras, a remarkable study on concert hall acoustics, improvements in the majority of brass and wood instruments. All together: a good forty, not counting a large number of rather extravagant and even fantastical discoveries, which nonetheless show that Sax&#39;s inventive mind was ever alert.</p><p>萨克斯完成的发明和完善的清单很长。除了已经引用的乐器家族，还必须提到对乐谱、作曲、音乐方法的改革(萨克斯后来成为巴黎音乐学院军事音乐家的教师，由奥伯执导)，一本关于管乐器对肺部影响的小册子，一所计划中的发明家应用学校，一项管弦乐队重组计划，一项关于音乐厅声学的非凡研究，大多数铜管和木乐器的改进。加在一起：整整四十个，不包括大量相当奢侈甚至奇幻的发现，但这表明萨克斯的创造性思维永远是警觉的。</p><p>        True, the saxophone was not initially adopted by the composers of the age, despite the abundant flattering marks of appreciation it received and Sax&#39;s firm friendships in the musical world. It was a long and slow rise that the instrument was to see over the whole world.</p><p>诚然，萨克斯管最初并没有被当时的作曲家采用，尽管它得到了大量的赞赏和萨克斯在音乐界的牢固友谊。这是一场漫长而缓慢的崛起，这件乐器将传遍全世界。</p><p>  But the enthusiasm it gave rise to amongst writers, and not just minor ones, meant that it was increasingly used year on year. Moreover, it was not until 1942, a century after it was invented, that the first saxophone class was to be officially created at the Paris Conservatory for Marcel Mule who, in 1928, had founded the first saxophone quartet. Brussels followed, in particular under the impulse of Professor Daneels.</p><p>但它在作家中引起的热情，而不仅仅是次要的作家，意味着它每年都在被越来越多的人使用。此外，直到1942年，也就是萨克斯管发明一个世纪后，巴黎音乐学院才正式为马塞尔·穆勒(Marcel Mule)开设了第一个萨克斯管课程。马塞尔·穆勒于1928年创立了第一个萨克斯管四重奏。布鲁塞尔紧随其后，尤其是在丹尼尔斯教授的冲动之下。</p><p>    Ce sont d&#39;abord des transcriptions et des arrangements de grands noms du classique qui voient le jour, car bien des compositeurs ne pensaient pas au saxophone ou craignaient même de l&#39;utiliser dans des ensembles.</p><p>Ce sond des转录和安排de grands nomms du classque qui voient le jour，car bien des positeur ne parient pas au sax风ou Craignent même de l&39；utiliser dans des合奏。</p><p>  The first to see the light of day were transcriptions and arrangements of the great names of classical music, since many composers did not think of the saxophone or were even chary of using it in ensembles.</p><p>最先看到曙光的是古典音乐名家的改编和改编，因为许多作曲家没有想到萨克斯管，甚至不愿在合奏中使用它。</p><p>  For the saxophone&#39;s worth to be truly exploited, it took Berlioz, Halévy, Meerbeer, Donizetti, Verdi, Ambroise Thomas, Bizet, Wagner, Massenet, Delibes, Saint-Saëns, Puccini, Vincent d&#39;Indy, Debussy, Glazunov, Ravel, Piené, Richard Strauss, Satie, G. Charpentier, Tchaikovsky, Honegger, Singelée, Florent Schmitt, Jacques Ibert, Milhaud, Villa-Lobos, Gershwin, Britten and many others; among the Belgians were: Paul Gilon, Léon Jongen, Jean Absil, Mortelmans, Marcel Poot, Théo Dejoncker, Van Moer, Dury, René Bernier, Gaston Brenta, Léon Stekke, René Barbier, Raymond Leduc, Henri Pousseur, Jean-Maie Simonis, Pierre Boulez and others; from Dinant, there were Arthur Patinet, Pierre Rodrigue and Alain Crépin. There are more than six thousand symphonic works that use one or more saxophones, mainly the alto and the tenor. In numerous countries, saxophone meets and competitions have been organised.</p><p>要真正开发萨克斯管的价值，需要柏辽兹、哈莱维、密尔比尔、多尼采蒂、威尔第、安布罗斯·托马斯、比泽、瓦格纳、马斯内、德利贝斯、圣萨恩、普契尼、文森特·德拉祖诺夫、拉威尔、皮内、理查德·施特劳斯、萨蒂、G·查彭蒂埃、柴可夫斯基、霍尼格、辛格尔、弗洛伦特·施密特、雅克·伊伯特、米尔豪、维拉-洛博斯、格什温、布里滕和许多其他人；比利时人包括：保罗·吉隆(Paul Gilon)、莱昂·容恩(Léon Jongen)、让·阿西尔(Jean Absil)、莫特曼斯(Mortelans)、马塞尔·普特(Marcel Poot)、泰奥·德容克(Théo Dejoncker)、范摩尔(Van Moer)、杜里(Dury)、勒内·贝尼尔(RenéBernier)、加斯顿·布伦塔(Gaston Brenta)、莱昂·斯特克(Léon Stekke)、勒内·巴比尔(RenéBarbier)、雷蒙德·勒杜克(Raymond Leduc)、亨利·普瑟(Henri Pousseur)、让-迈·西蒙尼斯(Jean-Maie Simonis)、皮埃尔·布列。使用一个或多个萨克斯管的交响乐作品有六千多首，主要是女中音和男高音。在许多国家，都组织了萨克斯管集会和比赛。</p><p>      Later, configurations such as quartets and sextets formed, for which many works have been written. Methods, studies and exercises were published. The beneficiaries were also brass bands and civilian and military wind bands.</p><p>后来形成了四重奏、六重奏等组态，为其写了许多作品。方法、研究和练习均已发表。受益者还包括铜管乐队和民用和军用管乐队。</p><p>  In his book &#34;The Saxophone&#34; in 1955, Marcel Perrin, professor at the Algiers Conservatory, and the founder of a quartet, took the view that &#34;the literature on the saxophone can in fact be divided into three stages:</p><p>阿尔及尔音乐学院教授、四重奏创始人马塞尔·佩林(Marcel Perrin)在1955年出版的“萨克斯管”一书中认为，关于萨克斯管的文学实际上可以分为三个阶段：</p><p>  &#34;the stagnant period: 1845 to 1918: timid, staid compositions, &#39;rococo&#39; style, with theme and variations, salon and competition music.</p><p>停滞期：1845年至1918年：胆怯、古板的作品，洛可可风格，有主题和变奏曲，有沙龙和比赛音乐。</p><p>  the period of explosion: 1918-1930: the age of jazz! ... America! ... a triumphal breach in the grey veil of gradual obliteration that was all but fatal for the sax.</p><p>爆发期：1918-1930：爵士乐时代！美国！..。逐渐消失的灰色面纱的胜利破裂，这对萨克斯来说几乎是致命的。</p><p>  the period of reason: 1930 to date: the saxophone was at last understood, and started to have &#39;its music&#39;. It became more mellow, more &#39;serious&#39; and, having found its own true atmosphere, ended up being an essential ingredient of the greatest concerts&#34;</p><p>原因是：1930年至今：萨克斯管终于被理解，并开始有了它的音乐。它变得更加醇厚，更加严肃，找到了自己真正的氛围，最终成为最伟大的音乐会的重要组成部分；</p><p>        &#34; Without jazz, what would music be? But without the sax, what would jazz be? An oft-repeated sentiment. One could add, &#34;It&#39;s jazz that ensured the success of the sax, and vice versa&#34;. Everyone knows that it was in the U.S.A. (South Carolina and Louisiana) that jazz was born, reminiscent of Africa. It was already around 1850 that modern instrumentation (with the sax) was establishing itself in </p><p>没有爵士乐，音乐会是什么？但是如果没有萨克斯，爵士乐会是什么呢？一种经常重复的情绪。人们可以加上确保萨克斯成功的爵士乐，反之亦然。每个人都知道那是在美国。(南卡罗来纳州和路易斯安那州)爵士乐诞生，让人联想到非洲。现代乐器(使用萨克斯)早在1850年左右就已经确立了自己的地位。</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.dinant.be/en/inheritance/adolphe-sax">http://www.dinant.be/en/inheritance/adolphe-sax</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/发明者/">#发明者</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/sax/">#sax</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/萨克斯/">#萨克斯</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
