And so, I&#39;m of the opinion that people have the right to decide whether to accept a vaccine or not, especially since these are experimental vaccines,&#34; said Dr. Robert Malone  during a Wednesday segment on Fox News&#39;s Tucker Carlson Tonight, saying YouTube deleted a video of him speaking about the associated risks.\n Opening the segment, Carlson shared some studies showing heart inflammation and death correlating with the use of the vaccines.\n &#34;A Norwegian study conducted of 100 nursing home residents who died after receiving Pfizer&#39;s corona shots. They found that at least 10 of those deaths were likely caused by the vaccine. 10%,&#34; Carlson said.\n  &#34;Young adults in the prime of their lives are being forced to take the vaccine because Tony Fauci said that,&#34; he said, contending Malone\u2019s expertise makes him &#34;the single most qualified&#34; person to share information about the technology and warrants him &#34;a right to speak.&#34;\n Malone clarified that he was not discouraging the use of the vaccine but was providing people with as much fair information as he could about their risks.\n &#34;This is a fundamental right having to do with clinical research ethics,&#34; he said. &#34;And so, my concern is that I know that there are risks. But we don&#39;t have access to the data, and the data haven&#39;t been captured rigorously enough so that we can accurately assess those risks \u2014 and therefore \u2026 we don&#39;t really have the information that we need to make a reasonable decision.&#34;\n  &#34;That&#39;s one of my other objections, is that we toss about these words, risk-benefit analysis, casually as if it&#39;s a very deep science. It&#39;s not. Normally, at this stage, the CDC [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices] would have performed those risk-benefit analyses. They would be data-based and science-based. They&#39;re not right now,&#34; Malone said.\n  Malone also said he has &#34;a bias that the benefits probably don&#39;t outweigh the risks&#34; for younger people who are being encouraged or required to take the vaccine.\n &#34;I can say that the risk-benefit ratio for those 18 and below doesn&#39;t justify vaccines, and there&#39;s a pretty good chance that it doesn&#39;t justify vaccination in these very young adults,&#34; he added.\n Malone  discovered in-vitro and in-vivo RNA transfection when he was at the Salk Institute in 1988, and he subsequently invented mRNA vaccines, which are being used over 20 years later to combat the spread of the coronavirus.\n YouTube told the Washington Examiner of the video that while it is &#34;open [to] discussions of potential treatments and clinical trials related to COVID-19 on YouTube, based on guidance from the CDC, FDA and other local health authorities, we don\u2019t currently allow content that recommends Ivermectin as an effective treatment or prevention method for the virus.&#34;\n &#34;As such, we removed content from Bret Weinstein&#39;s channels that violated this policy.

Of those, 247 had mild to moderate illnesses and isolated at home, never becoming sick enough to be admitted to a hospital. Six months after testing positive, 136 of the 247 (55 percent) still had lingering symptoms. And those 136 weren\u2019t only in the older age groups. In fact, in all the age groups between 16 and over 60 years old, between 50 percent and 60 percent of COVID patients reported persistent symptoms.\n For instance, of those between 16 and 30 years old, 52 percent (32 of 61) still suffered COVID-19 symptoms after six months. The most common symptoms were disturbed taste and/or smell, fatigue, difficulty breathing, difficulty concentrating, and memory problems.\n The study is small, and the exact percentages may not hold up in larger studies. However, it adds to a growing body of data finding that long-term symptoms from COVID-19 are common\u2014even in young people and/or people who had mild or even asymptomatic disease.\n    In  a non-peer-reviewed preprint study posted in March, researchers found that a third of the patients identified through medical records as suffering from so-called \u201clong-haul\u201d COVID-19 had initially reported asymptomatic cases. The study\u2019s authors, led by researchers in California, tracked the electronic medical records of 1,407 patients who had tested positive for the coronavirus, but these individuals were not sick enough to be hospitalized when they were infected. Of the 1,407, about 27 percent\u2014382 people\u2014developed long-term symptoms, and a third of them were initially asymptomatic.\n Likewise, in  another study posted this month, researchers tracked health insurance records of nearly two million people who tested positive for the coronavirus. The researchers found that about 23 percent of the patients sought care for a new post-COVID medical condition one or more months later. Of the people who had mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 that didn&#39;t require hospitalization, 27 percent experienced persistent symptoms, as did 19 percent of people who initially reported asymptomatic cases.\n The authors of the Norwegian study expressed concern about finding mild cases in young people leading to long-term problems. \u201cIt is worrying that non-hospitalized, young people (16\u201330 years old) suffer potentially severe symptoms, such as concentration and memory problems, dyspnea and fatigue, half a year after infection,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cParticularly for students, such symptoms might interfere with their learning and study progress\u2026 Considering the millions of young people infected during the ongoing pandemic, our findings are a strong impetus for comprehensive infection control and population-wide mass vaccination.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-26 06:38:02", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot",

large Oort Cloud object approaching the outer regions of the solar system.\n   The discovery has caused ripples of excitement within the planetary science community because of the object\u2019s unusually large size \u2013 initial estimates suggest it may be as big as 130\u2013160\u00a0km across, substantially bigger than some of the largest comets. Studying the object could also give researchers insights into an enigmatic process in the solar system.\n Catalogued as C/2014 UN271, the wandering visitor was found in archival data captured by the DES project, which investigates the cosmological mystery of dark energy by photographing distant galaxies.\n  \u201cThe object appears in about thirty images out of the [approximately] 80,000 that were taken over six years for the survey,\u201d  Gary Bernstein of the University of Pennsylvania, who co-discovered C/2014 UN271 along with PhD student  Pedro Bernardinelli, tells  Physics World. \u201cPedro instantly recognized it as being of special interest because of its nearly-escaping orbit and the great distance at which it was first seen,\u201d he adds.\n C/2014 UN271 seems to have come from a region some 10,000\u201320,000 times farther from the Sun than Earth. This is within the Oort Cloud \u2013 an immense shell of icy objects thought to envelop the entire solar system. On its current trajectory, the object takes nearly 5.5 million years to complete just one loop of its orbit.\n The object is probably rich in ice like a comet and is currently around three billion kilometres from the Sun. It will reach its closest point, known as perihelion, in 2031. At that time, it will be positioned below the plane of the solar system, near the orbit of Saturn.\n  Part of the interest in C/2014 UN271 is that it may be something of a transition object. Astronomers believe that many of the long period comets, that occasionally appear with bright tails, actually come from the Oort Cloud. Stars wandering near the Sun can nudge these objects from their positions and over millennia they work their way inwards, with the gravity of the giant planets tweaking their paths on each visit until they reside where we see them today.\n \u201cThe fact that [C/2014 UN271] has a perihelion so far away from the Sun might be telling us that it\u2019s done this a couple of times but is still in that process of eventually becoming some of those long period comets we know and love,\u201d explains  Meg Schwamb a Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud expert at Queen\u2019s University Belfast.\n Scientists will be keen to see how C/2014 UN271 behaves on its long journey. Will it, for example, exhibit outbursts in activity, or even disintegrate? The  Vera C Rubin Observatory, due to begin its ground-breaking survey from Chile in 2023, should be in a prime position to record whatever happens. \u201cWith Rubin Observatory coming back and imaging the sky every three nights we\u2019re going to get an effective movie of how this object has evolved over a decade,\u201d says Schwamb.\n  Initially, C/2014 UN271 did not appear to have a cloud of material \u2013 called a coma \u2013 around it. However, astronomers using the  Las Cumbres Observatory network announced in an Astronomer\u2019s Telegram bulletin on 22 June that they have detected such a feature using a large telescope in South Africa. The emergence of a coma could be the result of ices sublimating from the body\u2019s surface.\n  \u201cThere\u2019s a complex range of processes involved, with much yet to understand, and this is the biggest of the small worlds on an orbit from the Oort Cloud that we\u2019ve seen go through that start-up of activity,\u201d says  Michele Bannister, an outer solar system specialist based at the University of Canterbury.\n Some researchers have suggested C/2014 UN271 could be a destination for a sample-return mission.

Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin scrambled to save faltering markets at the start of the pandemic last year, America\u2019s top economic officials were in near-constant contact with a Wall Street executive whose firm stood to benefit financially from the rescue.\n  Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, was in frequent touch with Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Powell in the days before and after many of the Fed\u2019s emergency rescue programs were announced in late March. Emails obtained by The New York Times through a records request, along with public releases, underscore the extent to which Mr. Fink planned alongside the government for parts of a financial rescue that his firm referred to in one message as \u201cthe project\u201d that he and the Fed were \u201cworking on together.\u201d\n While some conversations were previously disclosed, the  newly released emails, together with public calendar records, show the extent to which economic policymakers worked with a private company as they were drawing up a response to the financial meltdown and how intertwined BlackRock has become with the federal government.\n Mr. Mnuchin held  60 recorded calls over the frantic Saturday and Sunday leading up to the Fed\u2019s  unveiling on Monday, March 23, of a policy package that included its first-ever program to buy corporate bonds, which were becoming nearly impossible to sell as investors sprinted to convert their holdings to cash. Mr. Mnuchin spoke to Mr. Fink five times that weekend, more than anyone other than the Fed chair, whom he spoke with nine times. Mr. Fink joined Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Powell and Larry Kudlow, who was the White House National Economic Council director, for a brief call at 7:25 the evening before the Fed\u2019s big announcement, based on Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s calendars.\n  The records reveal how often federal officials engaged with a Wall Street executive at a moment of crisis, as they strategized about how to turn around markets that were descending into chaos. Mr. Fink\u2019s firm is a huge player across many stock and debt markets, and its advisory arm helped to execute some of the Fed\u2019s crisis response during the 2008 financial meltdown. That market insight and experience got him a front-row seat at a pivotal moment, one that may have put him in a position to influence a rescue with huge ramifications for households, businesses and the entire U.S. economy.\n \u201cThey\u2019re about as close to a government arm as you can be, without being the Federal Reserve,\u201d said William Birdthistle, a professor at the Chicago-Kent College of Law and the author of a  book on funds.\n On March 24, 2020, the New York Fed announced that it had again hired BlackRock\u2019s advisory arm, which operates separately from the company\u2019s asset-management business but which Mr. Fink oversees, this time to carry out the Fed\u2019s purchases of commercial mortgage-backed securities and  corporate bonds.\n BlackRock\u2019s ability to directly profit from its regular contact with the government during rescue planning was limited. The firm signed a nondisclosure agreement with the New York Fed on March 22, restricting involved officials from sharing information about the coming programs.\n But how the Fed and Treasury devised their rescue package mattered to BlackRock. The company makes a profit by managing money for clients in an array of funds, generally charging a preset fee. It earns more when assets under its management grow. In the early days of the coronavirus crisis, as people converted financial holdings into cash, parts of its asset base  were contracting and its business outlook hinged on what happened in certain markets.\n While the Fed and Treasury consulted with many financial firms as they drew up their response \u2014 and practically all of Wall Street and much of Main Street  benefited \u2014 no other company was as front and center.\n Simply being in touch throughout the government\u2019s planning was good for BlackRock, potentially burnishing its image over the longer run, Mr. Birdthistle said. BlackRock would have benefited through \u201ctons of information, tons of secondary financial benefits,\u201d he said.\n Mr. Mnuchin could not be reached for comment. Asked whether top Fed officials discussed program details with Mr. Fink before his firm had signed the nondisclosure agreement, the Fed said Mr. Powell and Randal K. Quarles, a Fed vice chair who also appears in the emails, \u201chave no recollection of discussing the terms of either facility with Mr. Fink.\u201d\n \u201cNor did they have any reason to do so because the Federal Reserve Bank of New York handled the process with great care and transparency,\u201d the central bank added in its statement.\n Brian Beades, a spokesman for BlackRock, highlighted that the firm had \u201cstringent information barriers in place that ensure separation between BlackRock Financial Markets Advisory and the firm\u2019s investment business.\u201d He said it was \u201cproud to have been in a position to assist the Federal Reserve in addressing the severe downturn in financial markets during the depths of the crisis.\u201d\n  The disclosed emails between Fed and BlackRock officials \u2014 11 in all across March and early April \u2014 do not make clear whether the company knew about any of the Fed and Treasury programs\u2019 designs or whether they were simply providing market information.\n Emails indicate that Mr. Powell spoke with Mr. Fink on March 23, hours after the Fed announced its corporate bond program.\n \u201cLarry Fink is available to speak today regarding the project you will be working on together,\u201d an email from Mr. Fink\u2019s assistant directly to Mr. Powell said. \u201cPlease let us know if there is a convenient time for you.\u201d\n  The call does not appear on the  Fed chair\u2019s official schedule from that March. Those calendars generally track scheduled events, and may have missed meetings in early 2020 when staff members were frantically working on the market rescue and the Fed was shifting to work from home, a central bank spokesman said.\n Mr. Powell\u2019s calendars did show that he talked to Mr. Fink in March, April and May, and he has previously answered questions about those discussions.\n \u201cI can\u2019t recall exactly what those conversations were, but they would have been about what he is seeing in the markets and things like that, to generally exchanging information,\u201d Mr. Powell said at a  July news conference, adding that it wasn\u2019t \u201cvery many\u201d conversations. \u201cHe\u2019s typically trying to make sure that we are getting good service from the company that he founded and leads.\u201d\n BlackRock\u2019s connections to Washington are not new. It was a critical player in the 2008 crisis response, when the New York Fed  retained the firm\u2019s advisory arm to manage the mortgage assets of the insurance giant American International Group and Bear Stearns.\n Several former BlackRock employees have been named to top roles in President Biden\u2019s administration,  including Brian Deese, who heads the White House National Economic Council, and Wally Adeyemo, who was Mr. Fink\u2019s chief of staff and is now the No. 2 official at the Treasury.\n The firm has grown rapidly: Its assets under management swelled from $1.3 trillion  in early 2009 to $7.4 trillion in 2019. By the end of  last year, they were $8.7 trillion.\n As it expanded, it has stepped up its lobbying. In 2004, BlackRock Inc.  registered two lobbyists and spent less than $200,000 on its efforts. By 2019 it had 20 lobbyists and spent nearly $2.5 million, though that declined slightly last year, based on OpenSecrets data.  Campaign contributions tied to the firm also jumped, touching $1.7 million in 2020 (80 percent to Democrats, 20 percent to Republicans) from next to nothing as recently as 2004.\n  In March, as some of BlackRock\u2019s own offerings were being rocked at the pandemic\u2019s onset in the United States, the firm reached out to Mr. Powell and Mr. Quarles, the emails show. In one or two cases, BlackRock appears to have had phone calls with Mr. Quarles. In others, Mr. Powell and Mr. Quarles did not reply, based on the released records.\n The firm\u2019s representatives also talked to Treasury policymakers other than Mr. Mnuchin in March, the emails show. One former official said such calls were part of routine information-gathering from a big market participant when markets were rapidly falling apart.\n BlackRock operates in  short-term debt markets that came under intense stress as people and companies rushed to move all of their holdings into cash. And problems were brewing in the corporate debt market, including in exchange-traded funds, which track bundles of corporate debt and other assets but trade like stocks. Corporate bonds were difficult to trade and near impossible to issue in mid-March 2020. Prices on some high-grade corporate debt E.T.F.s, including one of BlackRock\u2019s,  were out of whack relative to the values of the underlying assets, which is unusual.\n People could still pull their money from E.T.F.s, which both the industry and several outside academics have heralded as a sign of their resiliency. But investors would have had to take a financial hit to do so, relative to the quoted value of the underlying bonds. That could have bruised the product\u2019s reputation in the eyes of some retail savers.\n \u201cThis was the first time that E.T.F.s came under stress in a really systemic way,\u201d said Gregg Gelzinis, associate director for economic policy at the Center for American Progress.\n The Fed\u2019s programs helped to turn that around. The central bank supported the corporate bond market on March 23, 2020, by pledging to buy both already issued debt and new bonds. The program for existing bonds promised to also buy E.T.F.s, because they are a quick way to get access to a wide swath of the market. The bond market and  fund recovery was nearly instant.\n When the New York Fed retained BlackRock\u2019s advisory arm to make the purchases, it  rapidly disclosed details of those contracts to the public. The firm did the program cheaply for the government, waiving fees for exchange-traded fund buying and rebating fees from its own iShares E.T.F.s back to the New York Fed.\n The Fed has explained the decision to hire the advisory side of the house in terms of practicality.\n \u201cWe hired BlackRock for their expertise in these markets,\u201d Mr. Powell  has since said in defense of the rapid move. \u201cIt was done very quickly due to the urgency and need for their expertise.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-26 06:30:08", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,consulted,\u5148\u751f", "title": "\u9876\u7ea7\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b98\u5458\u4e0eBlackriock\u54a8\u8be2\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5e02\u573a\u878d\u5316\u4e86 ", "title_en": "Top U.S. Officials Consulted with BlackRock as Markets Melted Down", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/economy/fed-blackrock-pandemic-crisis.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "consulted", "\u5148\u751f"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "ddefa6e5caa517e1895385b0f98c9333.jpg", "infoid": 1068337, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5168\u9ad8\u6e05\u91cd\u65b0\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u8865\u5145\u89c6\u9891\u6765\u81ea\u5b98\u65b9\uff0c\u5854\u8fbe\u5e93\u9a6c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u3002\u8fd9\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u662f\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u8bbf\u95ee\u2192http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tro.2021.3070124 ", "note_en": "Full HD remastered supplemental video from the official, Tadakuma Lab.This article is open access \u2192 http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2021.3070124There are many ...", "posttime": "2021-06-26 06:29:55", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u9f7f\u8f6e,gear,\u8865\u5145", "title": "\u7403\u5f62\u9f7f\u8f6e\u673a\u6784 ", "title_en": "Spherical Gear Mechanism", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhDdfiRCQS4", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9f7f\u8f6e", "gear", "\u8865\u5145"]}]
