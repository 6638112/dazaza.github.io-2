"note_en": "Washington (CNN)On Thursday, the software company  Kaseya announced that it could help unlock any of its customers&#39; systems that were still inaccessible following a devastating ransomware attack early this month that took down as many as 1,500 businesses worldwide. But for many victims it was too little, too late.\n Kaseya had obtained a decryption key, the company said, that could release any file still locked down by malicious software produced by the criminal gang REvil, which is believed to operate from Eastern Europe or Russia.\n For the organizations whose systems were still offline three weeks after the attack, the newfound availability of a decryptor tool offered a sign of hope, especially after REvil mysteriously disappeared from the internet and left many organizations unable to contact the group.\n     But for many others that have already recovered without Kaseya&#39;s help, either by paying off the ransomware gang weeks ago or by painstakingly restoring from backups, the announcement was no help -- and opens a new chapter of scrutiny for Kaseya as it declines to answer questions about how it obtained the key and whether it paid the $70 million ransom demand or another amount.\n    &#34;This would have been really nice to have three weeks ago; we&#39;ve put in over 2,000 recovery hours now,&#34; said Joshua Justice, the CEO of IT provider Just Tech which worked around the clock for the better part of two weeks to get more than 100 clients&#39; systems working again from the backups Just Tech maintains. &#34;Of course our clients couldn&#39;t expect us to sit around.&#34;\n  Justice confirmed that the tool Kaseya has made widely available has worked for him. Kaseya spokesperson Dana Liedholm told CNN in a statement Friday that &#34;fewer than 24 hours&#34; elapsed between when it obtained the tool and when it announced its existence, and that it is providing the decryption key to the tech support firms that are its customers \u2014 which in turn will use the tool to unlock the computers of countless restaurants, accounting offices and dental practices affected by the hack.\n In order to access the tool, Kaseya is requiring that businesses sign a non-disclosure agreement, according to several cybersecurity experts working with affected companies. While such agreements are not unusual in the industry, they could make it more difficult to understand what happened in the incident&#39;s aftermath. Kaseya declined to comment on the non-disclosure agreements.\n  Some businesses hit by REvil&#39;s malware are frustrated with Kaseya&#39;s rollout of the tool weeks after the initial attack, according to Andrew Kaiser, VP of sales for the cybersecurity firm Huntress Labs, which works with three tech support firms affected by the hack.\n &#34;I talked with a service provider yesterday,&#34; Kaiser told CNN, &#34;who said, &#39;Hey listen, we&#39;re a 10-to-20-person company. We&#39;ve spent over 2,500 man-hours restoring from this across our business. If we had known there was the potential to get this decryptor a week or 10 days ago, we would have made very different decisions. Now, we&#39;re down to only 10 or 20 systems that could benefit from this.&#34;\n Most firms in the same position have chosen to eat the costs of recovery rather than pass them along to customers, Kaiser said, meaning they may have wasted labor, time and money performing self-recovery in a crisis.\n Even though some companies successfully recovered from the attack on their own, many others have struggled for weeks to no avail. The problem was compounded when REvil&#39;s websites vanished, making it impossible to contact the group to make ransom payments or seek technical assistance. The group&#39;s unexplained disappearance led to widespread speculation that the US or Russian government may have gotten involved, though neither country has claimed credit. US officials have declined to comment, and a spokesman for the Kremlin has denied any knowledge of the matter.\n  The cybersecurity firm GroupSense had been working with two organizations, a small-to-midsized private school and a law firm, which were left holding the bag when they could no longer communicate with REvil.\n &#34;We were in active negotiations with REvil when they went offline,&#34; GroupSense&#39;s director of intelligence, Bryce Webster-Jacobsen, told CNN earlier this week. &#34;Immediately, what we got from the victims we were working with was, &#39;Wait, hang on, what do you mean these guys are offline? What does that mean for us?&#39;&#34;\n Other victims had already paid a ransom to REvil. One such organization had been struggling to operate the key it obtained from the group, said Critical Insight, a cybersecurity firm the victim hired to help. But with REvil&#39;s sudden disappearance, the victim was stranded, according to Mike Hamilton, Critical Insights&#39;s co-founder. The victim, which declined to be named and had no reliable backups, was dreading having to return to its customers asking for new copies of all the data it needed to complete its projects.\n Kaseya&#39;s announcement this week will likely mean the eventual restoration of these victims&#39; data. But that doesn&#39;t change the resources they had to spend, and the gut-wrenching decisions they had to make, during the long stretch of time between when the attack occurred and when Kaseya announced a decryptor that the victims did not know was a possibility.\n &#34;An extra three, four, five days could be the difference between a business continuing to operate and them saying, &#39;We can&#39;t move forward,&#39;&#34; said Kaiser.\n  That kind of conundrum has factored into the Biden administration&#39;s thinking as law enforcement and intelligence officials have explored taking ransomware groups offline, people familiar with the discussions said. The National Security Council in particular has been studying how to avoid indirectly hurting victims who may be unable to get their data back if the criminal groups are taken down or disappear.\n The administration has increasingly moved to disrupt ransomware networks, track ransom payments and build an international coalition against cybercrime. But officials have steadfastly declined to say whether the US government played a role in REvil&#39;s disappearance. The group, which is also accused of carrying out the recent ransomware attack on meat supplier JBS Foods, went offline soon after a senior administration official vowed that US authorities would take action against ransomware groups &#34;in the days and weeks ahead.&#34;\n Basic cybersecurity hygiene is the best way for companies to inoculate themselves against ransomware, an NSC spokesperson told CNN. But for victims, the administration is considering how its developing ransomware strategy may affect them, the spokesperson said.\n  As more organizations take up Kaseya&#39;s offer of a decryptor, it&#39;s possible more will come to light about how the company came by the tool, Kaiser said.\n Until then, cybersecurity experts have been left guessing as to what may have occurred. Multiple experts agreed that the theories largely fall into a few main buckets.\n It is technically possible, but unlikely, that Kaseya or one of its partners managed to reverse-engineer the tool from the ransomware, said Drew Schmitt, principal threat intelligence analyst at GuidePoint Security. Groups like REvil tend not to leave vulnerabilities in their code that can be exploited, he added.\n A more plausible theory, he said, is that Kaseya received help from law enforcement officials. If REvil&#39;s disappearance was in fact the result of a government-led operation, the authorities may have seized a decryptor they could use to help Kaseya, several cybersecurity experts said.\n It is also possible that REvil itself could have handed over the decryptor, either voluntarily or under pressure from US or Russian authorities, said Kyle Hanslovan, CEO of Huntress Labs.\n But the likeliest scenario is also the simplest one, Schmitt said: That Kaseya or someone acting on its behalf paid the ransom.\n   That raises further questions that Kaseya has not answered: Did the company pay a ransom? If so, when? If the company communicated with REvil after it disappeared, how did it communicate?\n &#34;There are a lot of scenarios that could&#39;ve occurred, but we don&#39;t have much information to say one way or another,&#34; said Schmitt, who added that information about Kaseya&#39;s response to the attack &#34;could serve as a case study for future situations moving forward.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-07-24 11:36:17", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8f6f\u4ef6,companies,\u53ef\u80fd", "title": "\u4e0e\u53d7 Kaseya \u52d2\u7d22\u8f6f\u4ef6\u653b\u51fb\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u8868\u793a\uff0cKaseya \u8981\u6c42\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u5bc6\u5668\u8bbf\u95ee\u6743\u9650\u4e4b\u524d\u7b7e\u7f72\u4fdd\u5bc6\u534f\u8bae", "title_en": "Experts working with companies affected by the Kaseya ransomware attack say Kaseya is requiring companies to sign NDAs before providing access to the decryptor", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/23/tech/kaseya-encryptor-ransomware-victims/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8f6f\u4ef6", "companies", "\u53ef\u80fd"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1069401, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "CudaText \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\uff0c\u7528 Object Pascal \u7f16\u5199\u3002\u5b83\u662f\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u514d\u8d39\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u5546\u4e1a\u7528\u9014\u3002\u5b83\u542f\u52a8\u5f97\u975e\u5e38\u5feb\uff1a\u5728 CPU Intel Core i3 3Hz \u4e0a\u7684 Linux \u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 ~30 \u4e2a\u63d2\u4ef6\u7684 ~0.3 \u79d2\u3002\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7 Python \u9644\u52a0\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u6269\u5c55\uff1a\u63d2\u4ef6\u3001linter\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u6811\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u3001\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u8bed\u6cd5\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u529f\u80fd\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e EControl \u5f15\u64ce\uff08\u867d\u7136\u4e0d\u5982\u67d0\u4e9b\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u5feb\uff09\u3002\u5e38\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u201c\u5b83\u4e0e Sublime \u76f8\u6bd4\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u4f18\u52bf\uff1f\u201d\u7ef4\u57fa\u56de\u7b54\u5b83\u3002 Wiki \u5305\u542b\u51e0\u4e4e\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6587\u6863\u3002", "note_en": "CudaText is a cross-platform text editor, written in Object Pascal.

"note_en": "A chef is unearthing recipes from one of the world&#39;s oldest cookbooks to reveal the origin of Italian food.\n It&#39;s sunset in Rome, outside the city walls. Golden light filters through umbrella pines and casts its glow on a straight stretch of smooth basalt stones that changed the course of history. This is the Appian Way, the first road built in Rome, where more than 2,000 years ago soldiers set out to conquer distant lands and returned in triumph.\n  The road is the heart of Rome&#39;s  Appia Antica Archaeological Park, an expansive green wedge that stretches from the edge of the city&#39;s historical centre to the hillside villages of the Castelli Romani. This 4,700-hectare oasis is the second largest urban park in Europe \u2013 dotted with aqueducts, nature reserves, archaeological sites, vineyards, pastures and villas owned by such luminaries as designer Valentino and actress Gina Lollobrigida.\n Less than 3km from the Colosseum&#39;s crowds, the  parco gives travellers a place to slow down and leisurely experience the Roman countryside, complete with birdsong and sightings of shepherds leading their flocks. The scattering of ruins adds a certain  memento mori that enchanted painters and poets of the Grand Tour, as you feel the circle of life standing on this old road: soft breeze carrying the scent of fresh grass, crumbling stones carrying stories from the past.\n  As this is Italy, good food must complete the idyllic scene. Enter Paolo Magnanimi, of the Appian Way&#39;s  Hostaria Antica Roma. The restaurant is located within sight of the park&#39;s iconic Mausoleum of Cecilia Metella and fronted by a flower and vegetable garden tended by Magnanimi&#39;s father, Massimo. Inside, the menu lists dishes that can&#39;t be found at any other restaurant in the city, or perhaps in the world. Behind these creations is Magnanimi, a cook passionate about creating and serving meals that are deeply rooted in this park&#39;s history, from the days of ancient Rome.\n For most, ancient Roman food doesn&#39;t sound appealing. What first comes to mind are freakish scenes like Trimalchio&#39;s banquet in the 1st-Century AD story  Satyricon, where a nouveau riche host throws an ostentatious feast that includes such &#34;delicacies&#34; as bull&#39;s testicles, sow&#39;s udders and a hare decorated with wings to resemble Pegasus.\n  But Magnanimi keeps it real, recreating delicious dishes that regular Romans ate, not the exotic fare that was reserved for the super elite. A chef and historian who has spent more than 25 years studying ancient recipes, Magnanimi says Romans were nature lovers and sensual pleasure seekers who greatly appreciated good food, though over-indulging was very &#34;un-Roman&#34;. Grains, legumes, vegetables, eggs and cheeses were the base of the diet, with fruit and honey for sweetness. Meat (mostly pork), and fish were used sparingly, and as the empire expanded beginning in the 3rd Century BC, Romans welcomed new flavours \u2013 be it pepper from India or lemons from Persia.  Garum, similar to an Asian fish sauce, was liberally used to add a rich umami flavour to Roman dishes. All this was enjoyed with honeyed wine at dinners called  convivium \u2013 gatherings to celebrate life and the seasons.\n Magnanimi embodies this spirit of celebration, whether telling stories to guests or stirring up something delicious in his kitchen. Now 54, he laughs telling me how as a younger man he had a hard time convincing his father that customers would like his revivals of ancient dishes.\n  &#34;I started working in the Hostaria when I was 14 and took a break to have my &#39;Jack Kerouac&#39; years in the USA,&#34; he said. &#34;When I came back, I had a new appreciation for the great history of Rome, and I was hungry to learn more about it.&#34; Magnanimi&#39;s inspiration grew when a friend gave him Dinner with Lucullo, a book full of stories and recipes from the days of ancient Rome. Its title character was a 1st-Century BC military man who was so famous for his banquets that Romans still praise a good dinner by saying, &#34;that was a meal worthy of Lucullo.&#34;  Magnanimi started testing recipes and had his first success with  pullum oxizomum, a chicken entree. It is made with leeks and  colatura di alici di Cetara, a condiment from the Amalfi Coast made from fermented anchovies that is the perfect substitute for garum. Some Japanese diners especially enjoyed it, and that led to him being featured on documentaries in Japan. &#34;My Roman groupies came after that; they were harder to convince to try something new,&#34; Magnanimi said. &#34;And then pollo oxizomum was praised in The New York Times, so it is still one of our most popular dishes.&#34;\n These days, the Hostaria&#39;s menu features the Eternal City standards (such as pasta amatriciana and carbonara), along with the ancient Roman dishes that have brought Magnanimi international attention and made his once-sceptical father proud.\n I first met Magnanimi in 2008 when I landed in the Hostaria and, on the recommendation of a foodie friend, ordered  patina cotidiana, a tomato-less predecessor to lasagne. The original recipe used  lagana, a flat bread, which was layered with meats, fish and cheeses. Magnanimi&#39;s was simpler, filled with ground pork, fennel and pecorino cheese.\n  To recreate this 2,000-year-old dish, Magnanimi started with a recipe from the 1st-Century AD Roman cookbook De Re Coquinaria, the only surviving recipe book from ancient Rome, which is attributed to Apicius, a wealthy gourmand once described by Pliny the Elder as &#34;the most gluttonous gorger of all spendthrifts&#34;. Since the ancient recipes didn&#39;t use quantities or details for preparation, he then consulted noted Italian archaeologist Eugenia Salza Prina Ricotti to recreate the dishes by estimating their measurements with ingredients that were true to the era.\n &#34;I couldn&#39;t put tomato in it,&#34; Magnanimi said, &#34;because tomatoes didn&#39;t come to Italy until the 1500s, when Cortes brought them back from the Americas.&#34; The  patina cotidiana, which means &#34;daily dish&#34; in Latin, is now a restaurant signature.\n  My first taste kept me returning to try more flavours of ancient Rome, including sweets such as  tiropatina, a custard that&#39;s spiced with pepper, which Romans believed to be an aphrodisiac. Magnanimi told me his most recent creation is  la cassata di Oplontis, inspired by a fresco found in a villa near Pompeii. The rich cake made with almond flour, ricotta, candied fruit and honey sells out every night.\n &#34;My cheese, I make with the mortar and pestle, exactly like a recipe from Virgil, from the 1st Century AD,&#34; Magnanimi said. This is  moretum, a cheese spread inspired by Virgil&#39;s poem about a farmworker preparing his humble lunch, grinding together coriander, celery seed, garlic and pecorino. It can be slathered on  libum, a round bread that was sacred to the Romans.\n  I&#39;d seen black carbonised libum in a Pompeii Museum, where a guide told me that its crumbs were placed on altars as an offering to household gods \u2013 a precursor to the Christian eucharist. Magnanimi shapes his libum in light, puffy rolls and stuffs them with ricotta sourced from the sheep farm up the road.\n Magnanimi missed engaging with guests during Italy&#39;s Covid-19 lockdown. With all the free time, he took lots of walks through the surrounding Appian Way, where leafy footpaths and bike lanes served as an outdoor refuge for Italians enduring some of Europe&#39;s strictest  lockdown measures.\n &#34;I spent a long morning with a shepherd, some days I&#39;d see so many Romans coming here to jog because they couldn&#39;t go to the gym, and on weekends, there were families having picnics near the aqueducts, probably coming here for the first time. I could tell we all were feeling a bigger appreciation for where we live, for Rome.&#34;\n &#34;Paolo is an important part of this place. He keeps it lively,&#34; said Simone Quilici, the director of the Appia Antica Archaeological Park. Quilici is continuing a mission that began in the early 19th Century when the idea of preserving this area began to take hold. That&#39;s when archaeologist and architect Luigi Canina decided to plant the now archetypal umbrella pines along the Appian Way.\n  Sadly, the park plans were never fulfilled and by the 20th Century, with uncontrolled traffic and the turbulence of the World War years, there was danger that this precious section of the Appian Way would be destroyed. The area became vandalised and riddled with criminal activity. Finally in 1988, largely thanks to decades of protests, the area was officially designated a park.\n &#34;I remember coming here as a little girl,&#34; Eleonora Fanelli, a Roman archaeologist and tour guide told me. &#34;I couldn&#39;t believe this was in my city, a place out of a fairy tale where I could imagine a prince on horseback galloping on the path.&#34; Now, Fanelli loves to take visitors here. &#34;Even if it&#39;s raining, they want to get out and walk on the road, step on the stones that have chariot wheel marks on them, from 312BC!&#34; She loves to tell the story of the Roman censor, Appius Claudius Caecus, who nearly bankrupted the Roman treasury to have this road built. The legend goes that though he went blind, he still maintained quality control by walking barefoot on the road to ensure that the stones were smoothly laid. The Appian Way eventually extended 563km south to Brindisi on the Adriatic coast, and was the key to the creation of the Roman Empire.\n Magnanimi has lived in the park for two decades and has high praise for Quilici&#39;s leadership. &#34;Since he began in 2017, he&#39;s made the park so much better for Romans and for tourists. New things have opened, like the 2nd-Century AD thermal baths of  Capo di Bove, where there are beautiful mosaics and a garden.&#34; There is also a new  ItinerAppia App, where visitors can scan a QR code and learn about each monument.\n &#34;I feel so lucky to live here and to welcome travellers to experience Rome,  La Grande Bellezza, for real!,&#34; Magnanimi said. &#34;Here they can step back thousands of years on these stones and know how good it tasted.&#34;\n  Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on   Facebook , or follow us on   Twitter  and   Instagram .\n If you liked this story,   sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter  called &#34;The Essential List&#34;.

"note_en": "As David Arthur Johnston takes a seat next to me on a bench in the courtyard of the Greater Victoria Public Library\u2019s main branch, I can see that his greying beard is so long and bushy it hides his neck and that his eyes are a light shade of blue, but it\u2019s his coffee that has caught my attention. It\u2019s in a to-go cup. A to-go cup.\n I ask him how he got the coffee. I realize it&#39;s an abrupt conversation starter, but it\u2019s also a fair question for someone who claims not to ever use money. He answers without hesitation: \u201cThe 9-10 Club. It&#39;s a kitchen that&#39;s open on weekday mornings for the homeless. They have food and coffee there.\u201d\n Throughout our conversation, and in many later conversations as well, I repeatedly find myself asking where or how he\u2019s acquired something. Not because I\u2019m looking for a gotcha moment, but because Johnston has organized his life around something that seems impossible and I want to know how he pulls it off.\n For those of us who struggle to make ends meet or who are disorganized or negligent with personal finances, or who can\u2019t seem to ever create a cushion for unexpected expenses, the idea of doing away with money might seem spectacularly appealing. We all know financial problems can wreak havoc, leading to health-compromising stress, divorce, homelessness. Who but the wealthy hasn\u2019t had to rack their brain to figure out how to bring in more money?\n But what if instead of always trying to figure out how to get more money, you could figure out how not to need it? What if it were possible to sever your dependence on it? To banish it completely from your life?\n  For most of us, such questions would remain a thought experiment absent a major reorganization of civilization and the global economy. But, motivated by reasons more pure than stress relief, Johnston ditched money almost two decades ago, and he says there\u2019s no going back.\n His last purchases\u2014beer, cigarettes, pot\u2014occurred 18 years ago, he says, on his 31st birthday. He claims he hasn\u2019t spent any money since. It\u2019s true, his friends have told me. No money at all.\n David Shebib, who befriended Johnston after testing his integrity\u2014he offered Johnston $20\u2014has provided a room for him to sleep in at times in the various houses he\u2019s rented over the years. He says Johnston refuses to even touch money. \u201cPeople can\u2019t give him money to give to me,\u201d he says. \u201cHe won\u2019t take an envelope from me with money in it to give to somebody else.\u201d\n Cliff MacLean, who met Johnston in 2003 while protesting the second Iraq war, says Johnston does touch money\u2014but only to destroy it or render it unusable. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him throw toonies or loonies in the ocean,\u201d he says.\n Johnston also throws found change into gutters and garbage bins and cuts out serial numbers on bills. Before 2011, when banknotes were still made of paper instead of polymer, they were easier to destroy\u2014he could just burn them.\n He doesn\u2019t seek out money for this purpose, he says. Rather, he handles it like an offensive picture littering the sidewalk or a swear word carved into a tree: \u201cThe idea is to not let kids see it.\u201d\n That\u2019s because Johnston\u2019s feelings about money are inextricably bound up in his certainty that refusing to spend it is the only moral way to live. Feeling fortunate to have broken out of \u201cset conditionings,\u201d he hopes his example\u2014as well as his writings, conversations, YouTube channel, and activism\u2014inspires others to do the same. For all Johnston\u2019s proselytizing, he lacks a pushiness. Instead, he exudes\u2014and has worked on cultivating\u2014patience and calm.\n Shebib considers him a \u201cprophet.\u201d MacLean compares him to the Stoics and says he has immense respect for Johnston\u2019s ability to stand firmly for what he believes. \u201cHe&#39;s just a little out of phase with this century,\u201d he says.\n Strangers often take a harsher view. Johnston is aware of how he can strike people as \u201cnice\u201d but \u201ccrazy.\u201d They\u2019re right about the nice part, Johnston says. Shebib concurs: \u201cHe&#39;s actually quite nice all the time. It annoys me because he doesn&#39;t have flare-ups like I do.\u201d\n After Johnston and I talk for a bit outside the library, he suggests that we walk over to St. Ann\u2019s Academy, a historic, provincially owned property on Humboldt Street that spans six acres and houses Victoria\u2019s first Roman Catholic cathedral. It\u2019s also the site of a monumental years-long showdown he had with the city, when his insistence on sleeping on the grounds of the national landmark led to his being arrested or detained so many times he lost count (he believes it\u2019s somewhere between 40 and 60).\n The showdown, which began in 2004, also paved the path for Johnston\u2019s involvement in a constitutional battle that fundamentally changed the way Victoria responds to its unhoused population and that has implications for other Canadian cities as well. Two copies of his self-published journal from that period, The Right to Sleep: The Occupation of St. Ann\u2019s Academy, are available through the Victoria Public Library: one is in circulation; the other sits in the heritage room.\n As we walk through the city, Johnston offers a small disclaimer, putting out in the open what he calls his one \u201cdebatable\u201d act of spending, post-31st birthday. If you count a gift card that someone gave him back in 2012, which he used on Big Macs and coffee, then, he says, he\u2019s been money-free for only nine years.\n  You would think that if someone has disavowed money\u2014has completely stopped using it\u2014that life for that person would become a non-stop scramble to survive. But Johnston doesn\u2019t scramble. If he\u2019s meant to eat on any given day, he will cross paths with something edible. People offer him food, or they don\u2019t. He finds it in dumpsters, or he doesn\u2019t. Under no circumstances would he buy groceries for himself, he says. And though he will accept gifts, he doesn\u2019t beg. Good karma has enabled him to survive, he says. But survival isn\u2019t what\u2019s most important to him. What\u2019s most important is living in a way that\u2019s right and true. And if living right and true doesn\u2019t end up sustaining his life, well then so be it. He\u2019s not built for this world.\n Johnston started catching on to what he calls \u201cthe truth\u201d\u2014there is no \u201chis\u201d truth or \u201ca\u201d truth\u201424 years ago, after the first of two life-altering epiphanies obliterated his self-image.\n Prior to 1997, he had thought of himself as an \u201cAverage Joe.\u201d Growing up poor in central Alberta, he suspected that he and his family were perhaps a little smarter than others\u2014his mother\u2019s generation claimed valedictorians\u2014but he felt, overall, that his life was unremarkable. He lived with his mother and sister in the country, about ten kilometres southwest of Lacombe, and visited his father, a mailman, in the nearby town of Red Deer every second weekend. His mother worked as a cashier at her brother\u2019s general store.\n Johnston was naturally social, but like so many others, he experienced anxiety and rejections. Still, he made friends easily and in high school became part of an eclectic group that included athletes, musicians, nerds, and drama geeks. (He says he evolved from basic nerd to drama geek.)\n Johnston\u2019s longtime friend Earl Oberst, who was part of the group, says Johnston had a big heart and could connect with anyone. He also had an open, curious mind. \u201cHe could take two books from the library and have them done before the end of the day,\u201d Oberst recalls. But Johnston skipped a lot of school, and when, in his senior year, he learned he\u2019d be expelled if he missed another day, he dropped out.\n Johnston and his friends often congregated around a campfire in his backyard because his mother, who\u2019s now deceased, allowed for such gatherings. She was a \u201csurrogate mom\u201d figure for Johnston\u2019s friends, says Oberst, who remembers her fondly as a \u201cGod-fearing, homemade-wine-drinking, free-spirited woman\u201d affectionately known to the group as \u201cMama Lea.\u201d\n Today, many in Johnston\u2019s high school group remain friends. While most of them have followed a conventional trajectory\u2014partnered up, settled into careers, had their own families\u2014Johnston, though he has two children, stands out for being \u201con his quest,\u201d Oberst says. \u201cThat\u2019s what a lot of us call it.\u201d He adds, \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think it would last this long.\u201d\n Shortly after leaving high school, Johnston made his way to Vancouver Island, moved in with an uncle in Gordon Head, and found work making bread at Rising Star Bakery. He briefly considered trying to enrol in university, despite not having a high school diploma, but he says he lacked the \u201cgumption\u201d and the idea fizzled.\n  With paid membership, every penny goes directly to helping our newsroom continue its work and helps our team grow and expand our coverage\n Become a Member\n First Name  Email  I consent to receiving emails from the Capital Daily. I understand I can unsubscribe at any time.\n He left the bakery job for a stint teaching English in Seoul, South Korea, where \u201cthe monkishness\u201d that would eventually dominate his life began to assert itself. After only three months in the city, he says he was overcome by a desire to flee its metropolitan culture, its decadence, its pharmacy walls dedicated to hangover medications, the shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, the lack of fresh air and bodies of water.\n He returned to Victoria and the bakery. He worked the early morning shift. By noon, he\u2019d be down at Dallas Road, meditating by the ocean and pondering the meaning of life and the nature of the universe.\n The job eventually got in the way of all the meditating and pondering. So, being a \u201cresponsible monk,\u201d he quit.\n  The first one occurred on his 25th birthday, \u00a0June 28, 1997. He\u2019d recently given away his motorbike and rid himself of all the belongings he couldn\u2019t carry in a backpack. But on that day, Johnston\u2019s drift from societal expectations gained an unstoppable momentum. While meditating down at the ocean\u2014and tripping on acid courtesy of the motorbike\u2019s new owner\u2014he experienced what would become for him unshakable insights having to do with patience, fate, and love. He says he emerged with a new understanding: that free will wasn\u2019t real; that although the world was in a state of suffering and everything was wrong, no one was to blame; that evil wasn\u2019t real; \u00a0that the whole of society was built on lies. He felt intense love. He knew that everything had changed.\n He could never again hold a conventional job. He needed his only responsibility to be to the truth. \u201cEssentially, I had seen that truth was more important than life,\u201d he would later write in the preface to his self-published journal.\n But he didn\u2019t yet have the words to describe what was going on in his head. With \u201ca scrambled brain\u201d and \u201cbarely communicative,\u201d he returned to Alberta. He planted himself on his mother\u2019s couch and remained there for the next year, working through his thoughts.\n \u201cThere&#39;s nothing healthier than a nervous breakdown,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWe don&#39;t have nervous breakdowns if we don&#39;t need them.\u201d As he sees it, \u201cIf a brain sees truth and our ego tries to ignore it, our brains will make us crazy. So that&#39;s the fail-safe\u2014that in the end, we will be so unhappy that we will force ourselves into enlightenment or kill ourselves. We either self-destruct or we get enlightened.\u201d\n Believing he had definitive answers to the unresolved ancient philosophical debate about free will and its connection to moral responsibility, Johnston, of course, felt enlightened. And when he felt ready to articulate what he\u2019d come to understand, he wrote it down.\n He returned to Victoria, armed with a small book he\u2019d typed out that espoused his worldview. Titled A Love Virus, he sold photocopies of it at the Inner Harbour for a dollar apiece or gave them away for a donation. \u201cBasically, I wanted to let everyone know they didn&#39;t have to be so sad and crazy,\u201d he says.\n While adjusting to living outside, he often felt sleep deprived. He stayed on Mount Doug for a few months before discovering Beacon Hill Park and Streetlink Emergency Shelter. Despite the exhaustion, he says, \u201cI was sort of in a resigned bliss.\u201d\n Most of his waking hours were spent on the causeway in front of the Empress Hotel. He\u2019d lay out copies of A Love Virus (which he updated a few times) and set up a cardboard sign that changed daily but always carried a pithy handwritten message\u2014often about patience or fate and always an \u201cattempt to articulate the highest truth with the least amount of words,\u201d he says.\n People\u2014usually tourists, sometimes downtown workers\u2014would see his signs and engage him in conversation. Some would give him meals or money. In addition to those donations, and whatever he made from selling his book, his uncle provided him with about $20 a month, he says. He was also still cashing GST checks at that time. Without expenses, he figures he was getting by on about $2,000 a year.\n One day Johnston looked up from his meditation spot on the Inner Harbour and saw that a tent city had sprung up on the lawn of the legislative building. \u201cIt was university students just doing a protest about the tuition or something like that,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut right away, it turned into people taking advantage of the ability to sleep, and so houseless folk started living on the lawn as well with the university students.\u201d\n Johnston settled in and befriended a crew of people who were \u201call looking for ways to be creative and save the world.\u201d One was on a speech fast and hadn\u2019t talked in four months. Another\u2014an \u201cinspired angel\u201d named Jason\u2014had just returned from a trip to India and had stopped using money.\n Epiphany Two happened a few months after they met, on June 27, 2003, almost six years to the day after Epiphany One. Johnston\u2019s father had sent him $50 for his birthday. With it, he bought beer, pot, and cigarettes, and then threw himself a small party at Beacon Hill Park. He overdid it and found himself lying on his side behind a bush. \u201cI was just pukey drunk,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was embarrassing. And then it just hit me. Like, I&#39;ve had enough of this. I&#39;m not playing this game anymore. And I was done. I had no use for money.\u201d\n It was an inspiration, not a decision, he points out. By then, he\u2019d spent several years reevaluating every societal and cultural norm he could think of, and there was just no more room in his reevaluations to feel OK about money.\n Through long talks with Jason about the meaning of life, the nature of God, and how to make people happy, he\u2019d come to see money as plain bad. How could it not be? It enabled organizations and \u201cpeople who rely on the belief in evil\u201d to do bad things. Armies, borders, possession, ownership\u2014all bad. And not only did money enable what he deemed insane behaviour on a grand scale, the dependence on it, the fear of losing it, the focus on acquiring it wrecked people\u2019s lives and drove them to be dishonest with themselves and others.\n \u201cPeople have gone completely psychotic in the thinking, \u2018I&#39;ll do anything to not be homeless,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cAnd so people are putting themselves through hell, living in situations that are just making them nuts to avoid being homeless\u2014like how many marriages are built on that? I&#39;m saying that death is better than perpetual anguish. And so once you get to that point, it&#39;s not about inviting death, it\u2019s just about \u2018rathering not\u2019\u2014like, I&#39;m not going to be bad, and if that means I have to die, then I&#39;ll die.\u201d\n Johnston says he hasn\u2019t had any close calls, that in fact, his fearlessness has been rewarded. People, he explains, just give him things.\n He tells a story about playing a bamboo flute down by the ocean. As he was reaching a crescendo and crows were flying dramatically overhead, he felt the urge to throw the flute into the water. So he did. He thinks he was making a point about attachment and impermanence in the universe. \u201cAnd the universe loves that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt&#39;s like, \u2018Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah? Well, here&#39;s a nicer flute.\u2019\u201d\n The nicer flute arrived the next day. \u201cI&#39;m sitting at the harbour. And some guy is sort of dressed like me, I guess casual, has this three-foot-long bamboo flute and a cup of coffee, and he is walking. And I say, \u2018Can I have a sip of your coffee?\u2019 \u2018Is that a flute?\u2019 \u2018Can I try it?\u2019\u201d The man gave Johnston permission for both requests\u2014and then he gave Johnston the flute.\n  If one needs little and has good karma and is resourceful (he has posted survival tips, such as how to make cardboard insoles, on his YouTube channel), getting by without using money is doable, according to Johnston, and it doesn\u2019t require disengaging from the world. The library, when it\u2019s not coping with a pandemic, has computers and internet for public use. Until recently, he was using an old computer at Shebib\u2019s house, where he stayed for nearly a year. He\u2019s designing a game, set in post-apocalyptic Washington, DC. It\u2019s backed up on a USB, so when he moved on from Shebib\u2019s place in early July, he was able to take it with him.\n USBs are \u201cmore accessible than lighters,\u201d he says, because \u201cpeople are always throwing them away.\u201d For the past seven years, he\u2019s been using an Android HTC phone that a friend who\u2019d upgraded gave him. \u201cIt was like being given an Iron Man suit,\u201d he says. He doesn\u2019t have cell service for it, though, so he can\u2019t reliably use it for calls, but as long as he\u2019s hooked into Wi-Fi, he can get onto the internet and send messages. He understands that the device could stop working at any moment, cutting him off from easy access to the digital world, but if that happened, he\u2019d probably just spend more time at the library.\n Smoking is \u201cthe one addiction that\u2019s maintainable when you don\u2019t use money,\u201d he says, because tossed-out butts usually contain usable tobacco. Shell them like a peanut and soon you\u2019ll have enough to roll a whole cigarette, as long as you have rolling paper, which he usually does because he has friends who are both generous and who smoke. It\u2019s a \u201cmoderately rare\u201d occasion when he finds himself craving a cigarette and lacking tobacco. \u201cWhen it rains, there&#39;s less tobacco,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then just wait an hour after it&#39;s done raining, and people resume throwing their tobacco on the ground.\u201d\n Johnston sleeps outside if he has to, but he doesn\u2019t have to all that often. After leaving Shebib\u2019s place, he secured a spot in one of Our Place\u2019s mat programs and is now staying in a gymnasium on Pandora Street with about 20 other unhoused people. He would have stayed longer if he could have, but Shebib will soon be moving on too. His rental house is being torn down so developers can build a large apartment building with commercial space on the site. It\u2019s a major disruption for Shebib, but Johnston has taken the uprooting in stride. He estimates that since 1997 he\u2019s lived equally outside and under a roof (either in a shelter or with a friend or friend\u2019s family).\n Shebib has been a recurring source of food and shelter over the years. He considers Johnston a good houseguest\u2014Johnston likes to cook, has a good sense of humour, cleans the kitchen, and even sometimes does his laundry\u2014but he and Shebib have never had an official arrangement.\n \u201cHe does what he does willingly, and I do what I do willingly,\u201d says Shebib, who, until recently, operated a junk hauling business. \u201cI never try to buy him, never try to bribe him, and I don&#39;t expect anything of him. So it works perfectly.\u201d\n He adds: \u201cWhat he does willingly satisfies me. I like this guy, I like him around. And he does things on his own that are for the greater good. And so I support him because of what he is doing. What he&#39;s doing is remarkable, and it&#39;s changed the law, and he has established himself as a person who does what he says\u2014is a practice of what he&#39;s preaching.\u201d\n  Johnston leads me up a small set of steps on Blanshard Street, under an arched wrought-iron sign that bridges tall hedges, and onto the grounds of St. Ann\u2019s Academy. An urban oasis lies behind the hedges. Its arboretum, orchard of fruit trees, formal gardens, and \n......", "posttime": "2021-07-24 10:55:40", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7ef4\u591a\u5229\u4e9a,victoria", "title": "\u8eab\u65e0\u5206\u6587\uff1a\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u7ef4\u591a\u5229\u4e9a\u7537\u4eba\u6ca1\u6709\u94b1\u8d70\u4e86\u4e8c\u5341\u5e74", "title_en": "Penniless: Why a Victoria man has gone two decades without money", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.capitaldaily.ca/news/penniless-two-decades-without-money", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7ef4\u591a\u5229\u4e9a", "victoria"]}]
