Thus far, Coda\u2019s Shishir Mehrotra and investor S. Somasegar  have told us what sings in Coda\u2019s pitch doc (not deck). We\u2019ve  heard how important it is to be customer-obsessed from Toast\u2019s Aman Narang and BVP\u2019s Kent Bennett. And Fifth Wall\u2019s Brendan Wallace  laid out all the biggest opportunities in prop tech. And that was just in the last month or so.\n In July, we have more top-notch speakers on the roster, including big-name founders and seasoned investors. What\u2019s more, these speakers are ready to hear about your startup. ECL features the Extra Crunch Live Pitch-off, where founders in the audience can pitch their products to speakers and get live feedback.\n  So without any further ado, here is a look at the amazing speakers we have joining us in July.\n   Jordan Nof, co-founder and general partner at Tusk Venture Partners, led early investments in companies like Lemonade, Bird and Sunday. He also invested in Wheel, co-founded by Michelle Davey, an infrastructure company focused on virtual care. Join in a conversation with them on Extra Crunch Live about what it takes to raise funding and use it to the greatest effect.\n      Check out the Startup Alley companies that will exhibit at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 in an episode dedicated to the art of the pitch.\n      Sequoia Capital is one of the biggest names in VC. On this episode of ECL, Sequoia partner Sephanie Zhan and Rec Room CEO Nick Fajt talk about how the two came together for the startup\u2019s seed round, why Zhan also led the Series A, and how it\u2019s gone on to raise nearly $150 million in funding.\n    As a reminder, Extra Crunch Live is accessible to anyone and everyone who wants to come hang out.

They expect good outcomes to come from little preparation, which doesn\u2019t happen. The meetings are being held and progress is stilted.\n One way to save everyone significant time (and win lots of friends) would be to just get rid of all meetings, but a well-prepared and well-run session can expedite communication and get a team closer to its goals. Unfortunately, most meetings are  lazily planned and poorly run, imprisoning attendees and halting productivity.\n   No one measures the impact of their meetings. So the first step is to start keeping meeting metrics so that you can identify the bad meetings on your teams\u2019 calendars.\n  My company has created  a calendar assistant that automatically measures and stops bad meetings before they occur, but if you can\u2019t automate the prevention of bad meetings, survey and learn from attendees after the meeting to record and measure them.\n Create taxonomies and quantify the types of meetings that are being held \u2014 for example: \u201cinformation sharing,\u201d \u201cbrainstorming,\u201d \u201c1:1,\u201d \u201cdecision-making,\u201d etc.\n After several months (ideally a year) of collecting metrics, you can grade the quality and look for patterns. You will probably find something along these lines:\n Very few employees decline meetings, even when it\u2019s obvious that the meeting is going to be a doozy.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 00:20:57", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u521b\u4e1a,\u521b\u4e1a\u8005,startup,\u4f1a\u8bae", "title": "\u6539\u9769\u4f60\u7684\u521b\u4e1a\u8005\u7684\u4f1a\u8bae\u6587\u5316 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tReform your startup\u2019s meeting culture\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/reform-your-startups-meeting-culture/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u521b\u4e1a", "\u521b\u4e1a\u8005", "startup", "\u4f1a\u8bae"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5ba7234fa31a1e060c125beaa2e61e1c.jpeg", "infoid": 1068032, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5b83\u5f52\u8fd8\u65b0\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5df2\u7ecf\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u8861\u91cf\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u5b83\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u5347\u7ea7\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u6295\u8d44\u3002\n Ryte\u5728\u4eca\u5e74\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u5728\u4f26\u6566\u7684\u6155\u5c3c\u9ed1\u548c\u516b\u8fbe\u901a\u4e50\u961f\u5728\u4eca\u5e74\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u4e3a\u5176\u7f51\u7ad9\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\u4e4b\u524d\u4e3e\u884c\u4e86850\u4e07\u6b27\u5143\uff0810\u7c73\uff09\u3002\n  \u5b83\u73b0\u5728\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u201cRyte\u7f51\u7ad9\u78b3KPI\u201d\uff0c\u58f0\u79f0\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc72023\u5e74\u5ea6\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f7f\u6240\u6709\u7f51\u7ad9\u78b3\u4e2d\u7acb\u76845\uff05\u3002\n Ryte\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4e13\u5bb6\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u57f9\u517b\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u8861\u91cf\u5ba2\u6237\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u78b3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6839\u636e\u78b3\u8f6c\u578bThinktank\uff0cShift\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c0f\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u548c\u652f\u6301\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5360\u5168\u7403\u6e29\u5ba4\u6392\u653e\u76843.7\uff05\u3002\u800c\u8fd9\u4e00\u8d8b\u52bf\u968f\u7740\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5316\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u540e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u8d8b\u52bf\u6b63\u5728\u8fc5\u901f\u4e0a\u5347\u3002\n Ryte\u73b0\u5df2\u4ece\u4e8b\u5176\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6Katharina Meraner\uff0c\u4ed6\u5728\u6c14\u5019\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5168\u7403\u53d8\u6696\u7684\u535a\u58eb\u5b66\u4f4d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6c14\u5019\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u7684\u6295\u5165\uff0c\u63a8\u51fa\u8fd9\u9879\u65b0\u670d\u52a1\u3002\n Ryte\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98Andy Bruckschloegl\u8868\u793a\uff1a\u201c\u76ee\u524d\u67091.89\u4ebf\u6709\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5360\u6240\u6709\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7f51\u7ad9\u76845\uff05\uff0c\u6216950\u4e07\u4e2a\u7f51\u7ad9\uff0c\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\uff0c\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e0b\uff0c2023\u5e74\u5e95\uff0c\u6c14\u5019\u4e2d\u7acb\u7684\u6c14\u5019\u4e2d\u7acb\u3002\u65f6\u95f4\u662f\u6ef4\u7b54\u4f5c\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7f51\u7ad9\u78b3\u4e2d\u6027\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u884c\u4e1a\u548c\u6d41\u7a0b\u76f8\u6bd4\u771f\u6b63\u7b80\u5355\u3002\u201c\n Ryte\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u8fd8\u4e0e\u5c3c\u52a0\u62c9\u74dc\u5723\u4f55\u585e\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u9020\u6797\u9879\u76ee\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u8ba9\u5ba2\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u8d2d\u4e70\u6c14\u5019\u8bc1\u4e66\u6765\u62b5\u6d88\u5176\u5269\u4f59\u7684\u6392\u653e\u3002 \n\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0cRyte\u8868\u793a\u5b83\u6d4b\u91cf\u6574\u4e2a\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u9875\u9762\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u9053\u7684\u6bcf\u6708\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4ea7\u751f\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u7684CO2\u91cf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002  \u5141\u8bb8\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u662fad-hoc\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u8fde\u63a5\u5230\u5e73\u53f0\u3002 \u7b80\u5355\u7684\u8c37\u6b4c\u641c\u7d22\u5c06\u5e26\u6765WebsiteCarbon\uff0cEcosistant\u548c\u5b66\u672f\u8bba\u6587\u7b49\u7f51\u7ad9\u3002 \u4f46\u636e\u6211\u6240\u77e5\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u5c06\u8fd9\u79cd\u670d\u52a1\u653e\u5165\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u3002  \u201c\u4e0eRyte\u5408\u4f5c\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u5982\u4f55\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6 - \u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u5173\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002 Ryte\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u9886\u5148\u7684\u78b3\u8ba1\u7b97\u5668\u4f7f\u6210\u5343\u4e0a\u4e07\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\u6240\u6709\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u4e86\u89e3\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ee5\u62b5\u6d88\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u78b3\u6392\u653e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u7efc\u5408\u6c14\u5019\u884c\u52a8\u6218\u7565\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u201cTristan A.

According to carbon transition thinktank, the Shift Project, the carbon footprint of our gadgets, the internet, and the systems supporting them accounts for about 3.7% of global greenhouse emissions. And this trend is rising rapidly as the world digitizes itself, especially post-pandemic.\n Ryte has now engaged its Data Scientist, Katharina Meraner, who has a PhD in climate science and global warming, and input from Climate Partner, to launch this new service.\n Andy Bruckschloegl, CEO of Ryte said: \u201cThere are currently 189 million active websites. Our goal is to make 5% of all active websites, or 9.5 million websites, climate neutral by the end of 2023 with the help of our platform, strong partners, social media activities, and much more. Time is ticking and making websites carbon neutral is really easy compared to other industries and processes.\u201d\n Ryte says it is also collaborating with a reforestation project in San Jose, Nicaragua, to allow its customers to offset their remaining emissions through the purchase of climate certificates.\n Using a proprietary algorithm, Ryte says it measures the code of the entire website, average page size, as well as monthly traffic by channel then produces a calculation of the amount of CO2 it uses up.\n Admittedly there are similar services but these are ad-hoc and not connected to a platform. A simple Google search will bring us sites like  Websitecarbon,  Ecosistant, and academic papers. But as far as I can tell, a startup like this hasn\u2019t put this kind of service into their platform yet.\n \u201cTeaming up with Ryte will help raise awareness on how information technology contributes to climate change \u2013 while at the same time providing tools to make a difference.

", "note_en": "In spite of that, many companies are attempting to attack the problem to produce a viable form of digital proof, sometimes called vaccine passports. For all intents and purposes, what many call a vaccine passport is simply proof you\u2019ve been vaccinated that you can carry on your smartphone, rather than on a card in your wallet.\n Some have argued against the digital approach  for privacy reasons. Others have claimed it is  a civil liberties issue, and some have pointed  to equity issues related to not having equal access to appropriate technology or the internet.\n  That lack of consensus along with the open ethical questions, has led some states including  Florida and  Georgia to ban the use of electronic passport records, at least as far as requiring them to conduct state business or to create a centralized vaccination record keeping system. In Iowa,  the governor signed a law last month that prohibits businesses and the state from requiring any proof to access services, whether the card is physical or digital.\n These are just a few examples of  the patchwork of state laws and executive orders that has resulted in even more complexity for companies trying to develop products to solve this problem. But not every state is banning digital vaccination records. Earlier this month,  California opened a registration system to request a digital record of your vaccination and New York  announced a system earlier this year to download proof of vaccination to your smartphone. More on these approaches later.\n We spoke to several experts to get their take on moving your vaccine card to the digital world to find out how this could work in spite of the obvious friction.\n  According to Dr. Shira I. Doron from Tufts Medical Center in Boston, whose specialties include infectious diseases and hospital epidemiology, it\u2019s not as simple a matter as may sound.\n For starters she says, states have not kept records in a consistent way. People have been getting vaccinated in all kinds of places from school gyms to pharmacies to stadiums, and it\u2019s not clear if those records have made their way to people\u2019s primary care physicians, assuming they even have one.\n \u201c[Vaccine passports could work] if [a system] had been rolled out that way [with central record keeping in mind] from December 15th [when we started vaccinating], but it was not. So, if somebody takes it on to go backwards and issue that kind of proof to people, maybe a system like that could work \u2014 and of course there are a lot of people that have taken issue with the ethics of that,\u201d she said.\n For her, it comes down to infection rates. As they drop with more people getting vaccinated, it could alleviate the need for any kind of proof at all because we would be safer simply because the infection rate fell below 10%. \u201cI think that more ideally we get down to such a low infection rate and such high rate of vaccination that there is no longer a concern about people walking into a building,\u201d she said.\n   If the infection rate remains higher than desirable, or certain entities like universities want to require it, how do we offer proof of vaccination beyond the paper card? Some people are pointing to the blockchain, but the approach isn\u2019t without controversy. New York State is using IBM\u2019s blockchain technology for its proof of vaccination called  Excelsior Pass, but  privacy advocates worry that doing so could expose people\u2019s personal medical information.\n The idea with the IBM approach is that you to go to your physician\u2019s healthcare portal or some other place that has your vaccine records, and which has partnered with IBM. The portal will present you with a QR code which you can take a picture of with your phone and store in your phone\u2019s digital wallet. The person then presents the QR code at a venue, which uses a companion scanning application to view it to see proof of vaccination (or a recent negative test). Finally the venue would verify the identity of that person with a secondary form of ID like a driver\u2019s license.\n The question then is why use the blockchain at all in this instance. IBM Global VP of Payer and Emerging Business Networks Eric Piscini, says that there are three main reasons. \u201cThe first is that the immutability of the blockchain is extremely important, and that\u2019s [a big reason] why we use it. The second piece, which is also very important is the decentralization of that platform so that [all of the vaccine data] is not just in one place. It\u2019s decentralized and managed by different parties. [\u2026] The third piece [\u2026] is the audit trail, and not just for me as a consumer, but as an [entity] that is trying to verify me,\u201d he explained.\n  But are those reasons enough to justify its use? Steve Wilson, an analyst at Constellation Research, who specializes in end user privacy thinks the blockchain is an inappropriate technology to use for digital proof of vaccination. \u201cBasically, I don\u2019t see how blockchain adds anything to the digitizing of COVID vaccinations or tests. The purpose of blockchain is to crowd-source agreement on the ordering of some events, and logging that order in a shared record. What problem in vaccination management does that address,\u201d he asked.\n  When California released a digital vaccination record app last week, it went a different route, using an open-source framework called the  Smart Health Cards Framework. The framework was developed by an organization called  The Commons Project (TCP) along with a broad coalition of health and technology organizations including Oracle, Microsoft, Salesforce, Epic and others.\n JP Pollack, co-founder of The Commons Project, Senior Researcher-in-Residence at Cornell Tech, and Assistant Professor at Weill Cornell Medicine, says that since the government has made clear it won\u2019t be compiling vaccine records in a central database, and because the vaccine administration system itself is so fragmented, it\u2019s even more challenging to create digital records. His organization is working to create a solution to that problem.\n \u201cWhat we\u2019re working on at  The Commons Project is a steering group called the  Vaccination Credential Initiative or VCI. And the purpose of that group is basically to design and advocate for a specification, someday hopefully a standard, that makes it so that all of those disparate issuers of vaccines can issue the same vaccine record in a signed and portable format,\u201d he said.\n That comes in the form of a Smart Health Card app that TCP has developed. \u201cThe additional layer that we have built is what turns [your vaccine] information into what we\u2019re calling the  Smart Health Card. And basically it\u2019s all of the information that goes on your CDC card \u2014 so your name, your date of birth, the type of vaccine that you received, the dates of your doses, lot numbers and where you received it. All of those kinds of things get packaged up into this credential, and that credential is then signed by the issuer,\u201d he said.\n  In addition to California, the state of Louisiana also went live with the The Commons Project solution this week, and Walmart recently announced that anyone that received their vaccine through them is now able to download a digital version of their vaccine record directly to the  CommonHealth app (available on Android) or  CommonPass app (available on iOS or Android). The company also hinted that other companies that have administered the vaccine would be following Walmart\u2019s lead in the coming weeks and providing access to digital records through the same apps.\n The approach doesn\u2019t necessarily solve all of the criticisms around equitable access to technology, privacy or the ethics of being asked to show proof vaccination, but it does provide a means to deliver the information digitally for those that want it in an open way.\n Regardless of the method your state chooses, if it indeed chooses any approach at all,\u00a0 it will come with its own set of pros and cons. The paper CDC card, as Wilson points out, is similar in many ways to the \u201c Yellow Card\u201d vaccination record that people traveling overseas have been carrying for decades, and that has worked fine.\n But it seems that in 2021 when approximately half the world\u2019s population owns a smartphone, while two-thirds have some sort of mobile phone, smart or otherwise, it makes sense to make this record available in a digital form. For the many startups and large companies trying to solve that problem, they will have to do more than come up with a clever solution. They will also need to figure out how to convince individuals, businesses and governments that it makes sense to even offer this approach, and that may be the biggest hurdle of all.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 00:20:17", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5bfc\u822a,navigate,\u75ab\u82d7", "title": "\u516c\u53f8\u5bfc\u822a\u4f26\u7406\u96f7\u533a\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u8bc1\u660e ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tCompanies navigate ethical minefield to build proof of vaccination apps\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/companies-navigate-ethical-minefield-to-build-proof-of-vaccination-apps/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5bfc\u822a", "navigate", "\u75ab\u82d7"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f98c8e8c03efffe977cac4c71e975843.jpg", "infoid": 1068030, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Microsoft\u5ba3\u5e03Windows 11\u5c06\u901a\u8fc7Amazon App Store\u652f\u6301Android\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff01\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5c06\u5728\u672c\u5730\u5b89\u88c5\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5b83\u4eec\u5c06\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u680f\u548c\u5f00\u59cb\u83dc\u5355\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u8981\u6c42\u60a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u8fd0\u884c\u3002\u4eceTiktok\u5230Uber\u7684\u6240\u6709\u60a8\u6700\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u5c06\u7528\u4e8e\u60a8\u7684Windows  - \u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u4fbf\uff08\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u5c1a\u672a\u4f7f\u7528\u8bb8\u591a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff06\uff0339;\u57fa\u4e8eWeb\u7684PC\u5bf9\u5e94\u7269\uff09\u3002\n  Microsoft Didn\uff06\uff0339;

These apps will be locally installed, meaning they will show up in the Taskbar and Start menu and not require your smartphone to function. All your favorite hits, from TikTok to Uber, will be available for your Windows-using convenience (if you&#39;re not already using many of these apps&#39; web-based PC counterparts).\n  Microsoft didn&#39;t go into much detail, but it&#39;s likely that Android apps on Windows 11 are powered by Microsoft&#39;s Windows Subsystem for Linux 2. These apps will be discoverable in the Microsoft Store.\n  Alongside this news, Microsoft  also unveiled a brand new Microsoft Store app, with a focus on being an open storefront for any app on Windows. This includes Win32, UWP, PWA, and now, Android apps. Windows 11 is expected to ship this fall, and that&#39;s when Android app support on Windows will be made available to the public.\n  This Android news is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Windows 11 news from today. We learned it&#39;ll be a  free upgrade for existing Windows users, it&#39;ll heavily feature  Microsoft Teams (poor Skype), and it&#39;ll have a whole host of new  productivity tools. With that being said, this Android development was  not expected, so it&#39;s a welcome cherry on top of the already incredible operating system-flavored sundae.\n However, even with all the announcements we did receive, it&#39;s worth noting that certain items weren&#39;t announced, such as a hard release date for Windows 11 that&#39;ll let people know exactly when they can grab the OS. And, lest we forget, there was also a lack of Surface Neo news, otherwise known as the most important item that could&#39;ve possibly been addressed.\n  Valve&#39;s class-based shooter Team Fortress 2 may be 14 years old, but myself and many others still play it on a frequent basis. Here&#39;s a look at why.\n Microsoft&#39;s current version of Windows on the market is Windows 10, which would imply that one day a Windows 11 could launch, right? Microsoft is expected to ship a large update for Windows later this year, codenamed Sun Valley, that is said to bring with it a brand new user experience with a new Start menu, sounds, iconography, and much more.\n Microsoft has announced Windows 11 today. But when can you get it? There are two answers as Windows Insiders can start testing it very soon, while the general release is later this year. Here is what you need to know.\n Instant computer \u2014 just add a screen. That\u2019s the general idea behind the ultra-portable PC, but it can be hard to know which one you want.
