I have sold to and bought from Amazon in about as many ways as one person can; I built an auto parts brand that sold thousands of SKUs to Amazon as a vendor (both stocking and drop ship) and as a marketplace seller (both “seller-fulfilled” and Fulfillment By Amazon, or FBA), before selling the company to a private equity fund in 2018. And I am now the founder and CEO of a startup called  Stedi (a modern EDI platform, if you’re familiar with EDI) that runs on Amazon Web Services; we automate transactions like purchase orders and invoices between brands and retailers.</p><p>这是过去十年来一直困扰我的问题。我以尽可能多的方式向亚马逊出售和从亚马逊购买；我建立了一个汽车零部件品牌，在2018年将公司出售给一家私募股权基金之前，作为卖家(包括库存和直运)和市场卖家(既有“卖家履行”，也有亚马逊(Amazon，简称FBA)履行)，我向亚马逊出售了数千个SKU。我现在是一家名为Stedi的初创公司的创始人兼首席执行官(如果你熟悉EDI的话，这是一个现代的EDI平台)，它运行在亚马逊网络服务上；我们在品牌和零售商之间实现采购订单和发票等交易的自动化。</p><p> Retail is my universe, and Amazon is my obsession. I’ve written this short book to summarize the mental model that this obsession has led me to.</p><p>零售是我的天地，亚马逊是我的痴迷。我写了这本短书来总结这种痴迷使我产生的心理模式。</p><p>  Amazon over the past 20 years has been as meaningful an economic revelation as Walmart was in the 20 years before it, and I don’t say that lightly: Walmart is one of the wonders of the modern world, built from scratch in a hyper-competitive environment, scaled from nothing to the largest company in the US by revenue and by headcount, all resulting from a singular vision of saving everyday people money with everyday low prices. It is the most successful social welfare system ever implemented, saving billions and billions of dollars for everyday Americans without costing taxpayers a dime. It is a testament to the power of compounding interest, to the power of a focused plan executed violently for decades.</p><p>亚马逊在过去20年的经济启示就像它之前20年的沃尔玛一样有意义，我不能掉以轻心地说：沃尔玛是现代世界的奇迹之一，在高度竞争的环境中从无到有，从无到有，按收入和员工人数计算，成为美国最大的公司，所有这一切都源于一个独特的愿景，即用每天的低价为普通人省钱。这是有史以来实施的最成功的社会福利制度，在不花费纳税人一分钱的情况下为普通美国人节省了数十亿美元。这证明了复利的力量，证明了几十年来暴力执行的专注计划的力量。</p><p> But Amazon is something else entirely, isn’t it? Its amalgamation of businesses don’t seem to make sense. It lacks a cohesive product strategy. It defies norms of focus yet it executes faster than seems possible for an entity of its size, let alone scope.</p><p>但亚马逊完全是另一回事，不是吗？它的业务合并似乎没有意义。它缺乏一个有凝聚力的产品战略。它违背了焦点的规范，但它的执行速度似乎比像它这样大小的实体所能达到的速度更快，更不用说范围了。</p><p> I am going to answer the question –  what is Amazon? – but you can’t begin to understand Amazon without first understanding Walmart. Walmart revolutionized the retail game; Amazon “borrowed” Walmart’s playbook as a starting point, just as Walmart borrowed the playbook from the early discount retailers as a starting point before it. And so I’ll start by answering the question:  what is Walmart?</p><p>我将回答这个问题--亚马逊是什么？--但是，如果不先了解沃尔玛，你就不可能开始了解亚马逊。沃尔玛彻底改变了零售游戏；亚马逊“借用”了沃尔玛的剧本作为起点，就像沃尔玛从早期的折扣零售商那里借来剧本作为起点一样。因此，我将从回答这个问题开始：什么是沃尔玛？</p><p>  Few people outside of Walmart realize Walmart’s historical scope of innovation. It built the largest private satellite communications network, enabling unprecedented coordination at enormous scale. Computerized point of sale systems, a massive trucking fleet to enable best-in-class logistics, innovations in EDI, the Sam’s Club format. The list goes on. But all of these innovations were really just developed in order to optimize what was a very simple formula: that is, the selection, pricing, and inventory of SKUs in, say, a 30,000-200,000 square foot store.</p><p>沃尔玛以外的人很少意识到沃尔玛历史上的创新范围。它建立了最大的专用卫星通信网络，实现了前所未有的巨大规模的协调。计算机化的销售点系统，实现一流物流的庞大卡车车队，电子数据交换(Sam‘s Club)格式的创新。名单还在继续。但所有这些创新实际上只是为了优化一个非常简单的公式：即选择、定价和库存SKU，比方说，一个30,000-200,000平方英尺的商店。</p><p> Of course, it took a lot more than that formula to run a store well – you had to give customers  all the things they really wanted: in Sam Walton’s words, “guaranteed satisfaction with what they buy; friendly, knowledgeable service; convenient hours; free parking, a pleasant shopping experience.” I’ll add a couple of things to that: the best location and effective marketing to bring customers into those stores to begin with. But, fundamentally, Walmart’s business was mostly about the first two things that Mr. Walton always mentioned: “a wide assortment of good quality merchandise” at “the lowest possible prices.”</p><p>当然，要经营好一家商店，需要的远不止这个公式--你必须满足顾客所有他们真正想要的东西：用山姆·沃尔顿(Sam Walton)的话说，“保证他们买的东西令人满意；友好、知识渊博的服务；便利的工作时间；免费停车，愉快的购物体验。”我还会补充几件事：首先，吸引顾客进入这些商店的最佳位置和有效的营销。但是，从根本上说，沃尔玛的业务主要是沃尔顿先生经常提到的前两件事：“种类繁多的优质商品”，价格“尽可能低”。</p><p> And, for the first four decades or so, Walmart became the best in the world at doing exactly that: using the square footage it had in each store as effectively as possible, stocking it with good quality merchandise at the lowest possible prices, and maintaining sufficient inventory to satisfy the resulting customer demand. All of the complexity and innovation that happened in the background was in service of each store’s merchandising efforts. The satellite communication system helped headquarters make sure that inventory was always in stock, helped one store learn from another store’s experimentation with product assortment and pricing. The trucking fleet delivered the inventory quickly and efficiently in order to make sure that stores had the inventory they needed for their customers, and cost-effectively so they could maintain the lowest possible prices. Computerized POS systems let customers check out quickly, or, in the event that they had to bring something back, return items as painlessly as possible.</p><p>在头40年左右的时间里，沃尔玛在这方面成为世界上最好的：尽可能有效地利用每家门店的面积，以尽可能低的价格囤积高质量的商品，并保持足够的库存来满足由此产生的客户需求。背景中发生的所有复杂性和创新都是为每家商店的销售努力服务的。卫星通信系统帮助总部确保库存始终存在，帮助一家商店学习另一家商店在产品分类和定价方面的试验。卡车运输车队快速高效地交付库存，以确保商店拥有客户所需的库存，并具有成本效益，以便他们能够保持尽可能低的价格。计算机化的POS系统可以让顾客快速结账，或者在他们不得不带东西回来的情况下，尽可能无痛地退货。</p><p> Choosing the right SKUs, prices, and inventory levels for a 30,000-200,000 square foot store – the business was as easy, and as hard, as that.</p><p>为一家30,000-200,000平方英尺的商店选择合适的SKU、价格和库存水平-业务就像那样简单，也一样困难。</p><p> Incalculable effort went into making Walmart absolutely world-class at merchandising. Walmart’s buyers became gatekeepers for access to the largest marketplace on the planet. The buyer’s job was to identify high-quality merchandise that the customer might want, and then negotiate the best possible price. As Claude Harris put it, “I always told the buyers: ‘You’re not negotiating for Walmart, you’re negotiating for your customer. And your customer deserves the best price you can get. Don’t ever feel sorry for a vendor. He knows what he can sell for, and we want his bottom price.’”</p><p>为了让沃尔玛在销售方面达到绝对的世界级水平，付出了不可估量的努力。沃尔玛的买家成为了进入这个星球上最大市场的看门人。买家的工作是确定顾客可能想要的高质量商品，然后协商出尽可能好的价格。正如克劳德·哈里斯(Claude Harris)所说，“我总是告诉买家：‘你不是在为沃尔玛谈判，你是在为你的客户谈判。你的客户理应得到你能得到的最好的价格。永远不要为卖主感到难过。他知道他能卖多少钱，我们想要他的最低价。‘“。</p><p> In the business of retail gatekeeping, the cost of errors was high. Stocking a Walmart store with inventory that the customer did not want was a compounding error: not only did it provide zero value to the customer, it also robbed the customer of the opportunity to buy something that they  did need. Shelf space was a zero-sum game. And, even after confirming that the item was something that the customer wanted, there were many other factors to consider: Would the vendor be able to supply enough in order to meet Walmart’s demand? Could the vendor ship on-time, and accurately? Were they in strong enough financial condition to absorb Walmart’s payment terms? Were they accurate enough in their costing to make sure that they weren’t selling at a loss, once all their indirect costs were taken into account?</p><p>在零售把关业务中，错误的成本很高。在沃尔玛商店囤积顾客不想要的库存是一个复杂的错误：这不仅给顾客提供了零价值，还剥夺了顾客购买他们确实需要的东西的机会。货架空间是一个零和游戏。而且，即使在确认商品是顾客想要的东西之后，也有许多其他因素需要考虑：卖家是否能够提供足够的商品来满足沃尔玛的需求？供应商能按时、准确地发货吗？他们的财务状况是否足以吸收沃尔玛的付款条件？一旦把所有的间接成本都考虑在内，他们的成本计算是否足够准确，以确保他们不会亏本出售？</p><p> Walmart, again, became the best in the business at weighing these considerations. The buyers became proxies for the customers, deciding what customers were likely to want and negotiating for ever-lower prices for those items, and taking into account all of the things that mattered to the customer that the customer likely did not even consider – like the vendor’s ability to fulfill demand at projected volumes. Sam Walton drilled the idea of “thinking small” and focusing on the customer into Walmart’s culture: What will the customer want when they walk into the store? What price will they want to pay? And how many will they want to buy?</p><p>在权衡这些考虑因素方面，沃尔玛再次成为业内最好的公司。买家成为客户的代理人，决定客户可能想要什么，并就这些商品的价格不断降低进行谈判，并考虑到客户可能甚至没有考虑到的所有重要的事情-比如供应商按预计数量满足需求的能力。山姆·沃尔顿将“小处着眼”和“以顾客为中心”的理念灌输到沃尔玛的文化中：顾客走进商店时会想要什么？他们愿意付出什么代价呢？他们想买多少呢？</p><p> Walmart reviewed more and more vendors, reviewed more and more SKUs. Most vendors and most SKUs did not make the cut, but, with the ones that did, Walmart’s selection grew rapidly, and it expanded the size of its stores as much as the local communities could sustain, and stocked them with as many viable SKUs from quality vendors as it could find.</p><p>沃尔玛审核了越来越多的供应商，审核了越来越多的SKU。大多数供应商和大多数SKU都没有入围，但随着那些入围的供应商的加入，沃尔玛的选择迅速增长，并在当地社区能够承受的范围内扩大了门店规模，并为它们储备了尽可能多的优质供应商提供的可行SKU。</p><p>  The story of Walmart reminds me, of all things, of the  watchmaker analogy – the classic argument for intelligent design, for a superintelligent or divine creator of the world around us, first posed by William Paley in 1802.</p><p>沃尔玛的故事让我想起了钟表匠的比喻-智能设计的经典论点，即我们周围世界的超智能或神圣的创造者，最初由威廉·佩利(William Paley)于1802年提出。</p><p> It goes something like this: suppose we were out walking in the woods and we came across a stone. We might pick up that stone and conclude that it had always been there, that it had occurred naturally. But if we continued on our walk and we came across a pocket watch, we would not likely think that the watch had always been there – we would conclude from its complexity, from its precision, from its  unnaturalness, that at some point there existed a creator who understood its function, who contrived of its design and brought it into the world through careful thought and execution.</p><p>事情大概是这样的：假设我们在树林里散步，遇到了一块石头。我们可能会捡起那块石头，然后得出结论，它一直都在那里，它是自然发生的。但是，如果我们继续走下去，遇到一块怀表，我们不太可能认为这块手表一直都在那里-从它的复杂性，从它的精确度，从它的非自然性，我们会得出结论，在某个时候，存在着一位理解它的功能的创造者，他精心设计了它的设计，并通过仔细的思考和执行将它带到了这个世界上。</p><p> The argument follows, then, that if one were to look at the entire world in all of its complexity – the careful precision by which nature works, with infinitely complex mechanisms like photosynthesis, weather patterns and migratory habits, food chains and even the complexity of an individual organism, that there must exist an infinitely-wise, infinitely-capable creator who contrived of the entirety of the system’s function and brought it into existence.</p><p>因此，争论的结论是，如果要从整个世界的复杂性--自然运作的仔细精确度，以及光合作用、天气模式和迁徙习惯、食物链，甚至单个有机体的复杂性--的无限复杂机制来看，肯定存在一个无限智慧、无限能力的创造者，他精心设计了整个系统的功能，并将其付诸实施。</p><p> I have to imagine that if a visitor from the 1800s were transported to a Walmart Supercenter in the year 1994, they would have come to the same conclusion that William Paley came to: marveling at the 100,000+ carefully-chosen SKUs around them, with the associates stocking the shelves, helping the customers, checking inventory, collecting the shopping carts, that the ‘invention’ – the creation – of Walmart was the result of intelligent design.</p><p>我不得不想象，如果一位19世纪的游客在1994年被运送到沃尔玛超市，他们会得出和威廉·佩利(William Paley)一样的结论：他们对周围10万多个精心挑选的SKU感到惊讶，同事们在货架上囤货，帮助顾客，检查库存，收集购物车，沃尔玛的“发明”--创造--是智能设计的结果。</p><p> In some ways, they would be right. Walmart, at its core – that is, a massive building filled with a selection of high-quality merchandise priced at the lowest possible prices – was a concept conceived of by a single man (though from what I’ve read about Mr. Walton, I doubt that he would have taken this sort of credit).</p><p>在某些方面，他们是对的。沃尔玛的核心是一座巨大的建筑，里面摆满了精选的高质量商品，价格尽可能低(尽管从我读到的关于沃尔顿的报道来看，我怀疑他会得到这样的赞誉)。</p><p> But the hypothetical watchmaker in our story had designed and placed  every single wheel, pinion, jewel, and jewel in the watch’s movement; Sam Walton certainly didn’t place every aisle, product, promotion, or set every price and inventory level in that Supercenter. Rather, Sam Walton was the ‘intelligent designer’ behind the Walmart  algorithm: that is, a) “a wide assortment of good quality merchandise”, b) offered “at the lowest possible prices,” c) backed by “guaranteed satisfaction” and “friendly, knowledgeable service,” d) available during “convenient hours” with “free parking” and “a pleasant shopping experience,” e) all within the largest, most convenient possible store size and location permitted by local economics.</p><p>但我们故事中假想的钟表匠设计并放置了手表机芯中的每一个轮子、小齿轮、珠宝和珠宝；山姆·沃尔顿(Sam Walton)肯定没有在那个超级中心安排每一个过道、产品、促销活动，或者设定每一个价格和库存水平。相反，山姆·沃尔顿是沃尔玛算法背后的“智能设计师”：即a)“种类繁多的优质商品”，b)“以尽可能低的价格”提供，c)以“有保证的满意度”和“友好、知识丰富的服务”为后盾，d)在“方便的时间”提供“免费停车”和“愉快的购物体验”，e)所有这些都在当地经济允许的最大、最方便的商店规模和位置内。</p><p> In other words, the size, layout, format, product mix, and the selection/training of the associates in that Supercenter were  the result of the algorithm that Sam Walton had designed.</p><p>换句话说，超级中心的规模、布局、格式、产品组合以及员工的选择/培训都是山姆·沃尔顿(Sam Walton)设计的算法的结果。</p><p> So, back to our question: what is Walmart? Or, more accurately, what was Walmart, circa 1994?</p><p>那么，回到我们的问题上：沃尔玛是什么？或者，更准确地说，1994年左右的沃尔玛是什么？</p><p> Walmart can be thought of as a  bounded search for the optimal selection, inventory, and pricing of SKUs that a local market could support. It was  bound, or constrained, by the characteristics of the local economy, and so each Walmart location was a direct reflection of the local market dynamics. The immensely difficult job of the local management team was to predict and implement the optimal mix that could theoretically have been found if every possible permutation were tested by the local economy. Undershooting or overshooting – that is, having too few or many SKUs, or too little or much inventory – would be a costly mistake. By the same token, higher-level managers were responsible for estimating the optimal size and location of the building itself, and for choosing the best associates to manage it, and so on. Each level of management, then, was tasked with managing their own level of the algorithm.</p><p>沃尔玛可以被认为是对当地市场可以支持的SKU的最优选择、库存和定价的有界搜索。它受到当地经济特征的约束或制约，因此每个沃尔玛门店都是当地市场动态的直接反映。当地管理团队极其困难的工作是预测和实施最优组合，而理论上讲，如果每种可能的组合都经过当地经济的测试，就可以找到这种最佳组合。超标或超标-即SKU太少或太多，或者库存太少或太多-将是代价高昂的错误。出于同样的原因，更高级别的经理负责估计大楼本身的最佳大小和位置，并选择最好的同事来管理它，等等。然后，每个管理级别的任务都是管理他们自己的算法级别。</p><p> Walmart executed on this algorithm almost uninterrupted for over 30 years, and it got very, very good at it, until, in 1994 – almost overnight – the algorithm that Walmart had methodically honed over the past three decades started to quietly work against it.</p><p>沃尔玛在这个算法上几乎不间断地执行了30多年，它在这方面变得非常非常擅长，直到1994年-几乎是一夜之间-沃尔玛在过去30年里有条不紊地磨练的算法开始悄悄地与它作对。</p><p>  Jeff Bezos had a big realization in 1994: the world of retail had, up until then, been a world where the most important thing was  optimizing limited shelf space in service of satisfying the customer – but that world was about to change drastically. The advent of the internet – of online shopping – meant that an online retailer had infinite shelf space. While Amazon did not have the capital to stock every SKU on the planet, nor a warehouse large enough to do so, it didn’t have a constraint on the actual ‘shelves’ themselves. An online retailer would be limited not by each local market, but by the economics and behavior of the national or international population at large.</p><p>杰夫·贝佐斯(Jeff Bezos)在1994年有了一个重大的认识：在那之前，零售界一直是一个最重要的世界，在这个世界里，最重要的是优化有限的货架空间，以满足客户的需求-但这个世界即将发生巨大变化。互联网-在线购物-的出现意味着在线零售商有无限的货架空间。虽然亚马逊没有足够的资金来储存这个星球上的每一个SKU，也没有足够大的仓库来这么做，但它对实际的“货架”本身并没有限制。一家在线零售商将不会受到每个当地市场的限制，而是受到国内或国际总体人口的经济和行为的限制。</p><p> Whereas a traditional retailer had to weigh tradeoffs within finite shelf space, an online retailer could display page after page of items with near-zero marginal cost for more items. Instead of choosing which items to stock, Amazon could let its customers do so – it would add all sorts of items to its catalog, measure web traffic for each item, and bring the items into stock that seemed most likely to sell.</p><p>传统零售商必须在有限的货架空间内权衡权衡，而在线零售商可以以几乎为零的边际成本展示更多的商品。亚马逊可以让客户选择库存，而不是选择哪些商品-它会将各种商品添加到其目录中，测量每一种商品的网络流量，并将似乎最有可能出售的商品纳入库存。</p><p> Bezos, in other words, wanted to build an  unbounded Walmart. By removing the constraint of geography – and therefore the local economy – and by adding search functionality, the new formula became simpler: the more SKUs it added, the more items would be discovered by customers; the more items that customers discovered, the more items they would buy. In this world of infinite shelf space, it wasn’t the  quality of the selection that mattered – it was pure quantity. And with this insight, Amazon did not need to be nearly as good – let alone better – than Walmart at Walmart’s masterful game of vendor and SKU selection. Amazon just needed to be faster at aggregating SKUs – and therefore faster at onboarding vendors.</p><p>换句话说，贝佐斯想要建立一个无界的沃尔玛。通过消除地理位置的限制-从而消除了当地经济的限制-并增加了搜索功能，新的公式变得更加简单：添加的SKU越多，客户发现的商品就越多；客户发现的商品越多，他们购买的商品就越多。在这个货架空间无限的世界里，重要的不是选择的质量--而是纯粹的数量。有了这种洞察力，亚马逊在沃尔玛精湛的供应商和SKU选择游戏中几乎不需要像沃尔玛一样好-更不用说更好了。亚马逊只需要更快地聚合SKU，从而更快地让供应商参与进来。</p><p> And so, back in 1994, Amazon kicked off its unbound search for the optimal selection of SKUs. Its algorithm – borrowed and modified from Walmart – was simple: a) a vast selection, b) delivered fast, c) at the lowest possible prices, d) backed by guaranteed satisfaction.</p><p>因此，早在1994年，亚马逊就开始了对SKU最佳选择的无约束搜索。它的算法-从沃尔玛借用和修改-很简单：a)广泛的选择，b)快速送货，c)尽可能低的价格，d)有保证的满意度。</p><p> Amazon added as many vendors as it could feasibly add, far outpacing other retailers because of a bar that was far lower. But the pace was too slow; Amazon was  aggregating demand – that is, customer traffic – faster than it was aggregating supply – that is, vendor selection. Amazon had bumped up against its first constraint: the speed at which it could add new vendors to its catalog and associated inventory to its warehouses.</p><p>亚马逊在可行的情况下增加了尽可能多的供应商，远远超过了其他零售商，因为门槛要低得多。但速度太慢了；亚马逊聚合需求(即客户流量)的速度快于聚合供应(即供应商选择)的速度。亚马逊遇到了它的第一个限制：向其目录添加新供应商的速度，以及向其仓库添加相关库存的速度。</p><p> Amazon correctly hypothesized that because  vendor selection was not important in the world of infinite shelf space, Amazon itself – or, more accurately, its vendor onboarding process – would be the bottleneck to growth. Another way of saying this is that Amazon did not have enough time, knowledge, or capital to fill the infinite shelf space that they had created – and even for the items they did add, they did not have the time, knowledge, or skill to effectively negotiate terms with the tens of thousands of new vendors who had come knocking. Amazon would never be able to match Walmart’s hard-won skills in fighting on the customer’s behalf for better prices, even with a small set of vendors – let alone the exploding vendor base it was starting to manage.</p><p>亚马逊正确地假设，由于供应商选择在无限货架空间的世界中并不重要，亚马逊本身-或者更准确地说，其供应商入驻过程-将是增长的瓶颈。换句话说，亚马逊没有足够的时间、知识或资金来填满他们创造的无限货架空间-即使是他们确实添加的商品，他们也没有时间、知识或技能来与数以万计的新供应商有效地谈判条款。亚马逊在为顾客争取更好价格方面来之不易的技能永远无法与沃尔玛相提并论，即使只有一小部分卖家-更不用说它开始管理的爆炸式增长的卖家基础了。</p><p> In its effort to remove this bottleneck, Amazon had an insight that would dramatically accelerate its strategy of mass SKU-aggregation: what if, instead of the painfully slow process of onboarding and negotiating with vendors, Amazon could instead open its website to third party sellers?</p><p>在努力消除这一瓶颈的过程中，亚马逊有了一个洞察力，将极大地加速其大规模SKU聚合战略：如果亚马逊可以向第三方卖家开放其网站，而不是痛苦而缓慢的入职和与供应商谈判的过程，会怎么样？</p><p> In the original six-page memo advocating for Amazon Marketplace in 2002, the memo’s author had a vision: no matter where a seller was located and no matter what products that seller carried, the seller could start selling on Amazon immediately – even in the middle of the night.</p><p>在2002年为亚马逊市场(Amazon Marketplace)宣传的最初六页备忘录中，备忘录的作者有一个愿景：无论卖家位于哪里，无论卖家携带什么产品，卖家都可以立即开始在亚马逊上销售-即使是在半夜。</p><p>  Amazon Marketplace solved a whole host of problems all at once. By allowing sellers to bypass the gatekeepers altogether, Amazon could rapidly fill its infinite shelf space with a vast selection of SKUs not available from other retailers. And instead of slowly building its own inventory on promising SKUs, Amazon could make a  seller’s already-stocked inventory instantly available to eager customers. And, perhaps most importantly, it solved the problem of how to negotiate pricing with a rapidly-expanding SKU base. When Amazon was competing against sellers for a given SKU, there were two possibilities: either Amazon had negotiated the best possible price with the vendor and would ‘win’ the sale, or it had failed to get the best possible price and another seller would win the sale instead – but Amazon would collect a 12-15% commission, and gain a data point that its nascent vendor team could use in price negotiation. And, of course, ‘losing’ the sale to a third party seller still meant that Amazon would keep the customer.</p><p>亚马逊市场一下子解决了一大堆问题。通过允许卖家完全绕过看门人，亚马逊可以迅速用其他零售商无法提供的大量SKU填满其无限的货架空间。亚马逊不需要在有希望的SKU上缓慢地建立自己的库存，而是可以让热切的客户立即获得卖家已经库存的库存。而且，也许最重要的是，它解决了如何与迅速扩大的SKU基础协商定价的问题。当亚马逊与卖家争夺某个特定的SKU时，有两种可能性：一种是亚马逊与卖家协商了尽可能好的价格，并将“赢得”销售；另一种可能性是，亚马逊未能获得尽可能好的价格，另一家卖家将赢得销售--但亚马逊将收取12-15%的佣金，并获得一个数据点，供其新成立的供应商团队在价格谈判中使用。当然，把销售额“输给”第三方卖家仍然意味着亚马逊会留住客户。</p><p> The advent of the internet had brought about a Cambrian explosion in SKUs. An increasingly connected global world meant that more and more products from abroad were coming to the US, and it was also easier than ever for US companies to launch and expand new product lines. The marketplace that Amazon had built took advantage of this trend; Amazon systematically removed friction from the seller onboarding workflow, doing seemingly small things like eliminating the UPC code requirement that would serve as a barrier for newer, less established sellers. All of these small changes started to add up, and Amazon became the fastest way for a company to start selling online. Customers began to associate Amazon with selection, and Amazon became the de facto storefront for the fledgling world of online commerce.</p><p>互联网的出现带来了寒武纪的SKU爆炸。日益互联的全球世界意味着越来越多的海外产品进入美国，美国公司推出和扩大新产品线也比以往任何时候都更容易。亚马逊建立的市场利用了这一趋势；亚马逊系统地消除了卖家自注册工作流程中的摩擦，做了一些看似很小的事情，比如取消UPC代码要求，这将成为较新、较不成熟的卖家的障碍。所有这些小变化开始累积起来，亚马逊成为一家公司开始在线销售的最快方式。消费者开始将亚马逊与选择联系在一起，亚马逊成为羽翼未丰的在线商务世界事实上的店面。</p><p> With every seller that signed up for Amazon Marketplace, Walmart’s prized vendor selection machine became more and more of a liability. Here was an entire organization optimized towards one constraint – shelf space – and that constraint had been almost completely removed overnight. Even if Walmart had recognized this immediately, it would have been an enormous ship to steer – and, in the meantime, Amazon’s SKU aggregation juggernaut was running an unbound search for customer value nationwide, while Walmart’s army of finely-tuned retailer gatekeepers was still running a  bounded search in local geographies. The effects began to compound, and Amazon’s ecommerce growth accelerated further.</p><p>随着每一个注册亚马逊市场的卖家，沃尔玛宝贵的供应商选择机器变得越来越成为一种负担。这是整个组织针对一个约束(货架空间)进行了优化，而该约束在一夜之间几乎完全消除了。即使沃尔玛立即意识到这一点，它也将是一艘难以驾驭的巨轮-同时，亚马逊(Amazon)的SKU聚合巨头正在全国范围内进行无约束的客户价值搜索，而沃尔玛精心调整的零售商守门人大军仍在当地地理位置进行有限制的搜索。这些影响开始复合，亚马逊的电子商务增长进一步加速。</p><p>  To make sense of what started to happen after Amazon rolled out Marketplace, you have to understand that  things get really weird when you run an unbounded search at internet-scale. When you remove “normal” constraints imposed by the physical world, the scale can get so massive that all of the normal approaches start to break down.</p><p>为了弄清楚亚马逊推出Marketplace后发生的事情，你必须明白，当你在互联网范围内进行无限搜索时，事情会变得非常奇怪。当你去掉物理世界强加的“正常”约束时，规模可能会变得如此巨大，以至于所有正常的方法都开始崩溃。</p><p> Walmart had solved problems of vendor management, product management, and bureaucracy at an almost unfathomable scale. It engineered intricate systems, aligned incentives, and built a culture of thinking small to stamp out inefficiencies wherever it could find them. Walmart solved problems that were  almost impossible to solve at Walmart’s scale, creating a wonder of the modern world, perhaps the pinnacle of what is possible with complex coordination. And Walmart, at its heart, is a company of merchants; it is a human-powered company, and its advantage in the marketplace is that it merchandises better than any other company on the planet. Walmart understands its customers extraordinarily well, and its merchants play a hand in every product that shows up in its aisles.</p><p>沃尔玛几乎以深不可测的规模解决了供应商管理、产品管理和官僚作风等问题。它设计了错综复杂的系统，调整了激励措施，并建立了一种从小处着手的文化，以消除任何可以找到的低效现象。沃尔玛解决了像沃尔玛这样的规模几乎不可能解决的问题，创造了现代世界的奇迹，也许是通过复杂的协调才能实现的顶峰。沃尔玛的核心是一家商人公司；它是一家人力公司，它在市场上的优势是它的商品比地球上任何其他公司都要好。沃尔玛非常了解它的顾客，它的商家在其过道上展示的每一种产品中都发挥了作用。</p><p> Amazon, by contrast, is an illustration of what happens when a massive global market is freed by the internet from the geographical constraints that previously kept it manageable; it is an illustration of what happens when you enter a problem space so large that you have to bypass the human element altogether. What was  just barely solvable with carefully-built systems at Walmart’s scale of shelf space would have been impossible to solve with shelf space that stretched on to infinity. Amazon had to find a way of abdicating responsibility for solving these problems altogether; with Marketplace, Amazon had begun to grasp at a solution that would do exactly that.</p><p>相比之下，亚马逊是一个例子，说明了当互联网将一个巨大的全球市场从以前让它变得可控的地理限制中解放出来时会发生什么；它是一个例子，说明了当你进入一个如此大的问题空间，以至于你不得不完全绕过人为因素时会发生什么。像沃尔玛这样的货架空间规模的精心建造的系统几乎无法解决的问题，如果货架空间一直延伸到无限大的话，是不可能解决的。亚马逊必须找到一种方法来完全放弃解决这些问题的责任；有了Marketplace，亚马逊已经开始抓住一个能够做到这一点的解决方案。</p><p> After removing the vendor bottleneck, Amazon had discovered the next constraint to filling its theoretically-infinite shelf space: computing power and data storage. To his horror, Bezos had discovered that Amazon’s software engineers were waiting weeks for technical resources like servers and storage to be provisioned. Instead of being limited by how fast they could write code, they were limited by how fast they could  deploy that code to Amazon’s infrastructure, and so, alongside an effort to dramatically simplify and improve its codebase – which had evolved into a mess of ‘spaghetti code’ in the ten years that Amazon had been in business – Amazon began </p><p>在消除了供应商的瓶颈之后，亚马逊发现了下一个限制其理论上无限货架空间的因素：计算能力和数据存储。令他惊恐的是，贝佐斯发现亚马逊的软件工程师要等好几个星期才能调配服务器和存储等技术资源。他们没有受到写代码速度的限制，而是受到将代码部署到亚马逊基础设施的速度的限制，因此，在极大地简化和改进代码库的同时-在亚马逊创业的十年里，代码库演变成了一团乱七八糟的“意大利面条代码”-亚马逊开始了。</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://zackkanter.com/2019/03/13/what-is-amazon/">https://zackkanter.com/2019/03/13/what-is-amazon/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/amazon/">#amazon</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/亚马逊/">#亚马逊</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/沃尔玛/">#沃尔玛</a></button></div></div><div class="shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded clearfix"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm"><div><a target="_blank" href="/story/1031138.html"><img src="http://img2.diglog.com/img/2020/10/thumb_8602bec2bfa3f7fc6b364dac6c735a5a.jpg" class="img-fluid" onerror="this.style.display='none'"></a></div><div class="item_title"><a target="_blank" href="/story/1031138.html">
