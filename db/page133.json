The company says the training \u2014 including \u201csafe marksmanship\u201d and \u201ccountering an attack\u201d \u2014 was defensive in nature and devised to better protect Saudi leaders. One person familiar with the training said it also included work in surveillance and close-quarters battle.\n There is no evidence that the American officials who approved the training or Tier 1 Group executives knew that the Saudis were involved in the crackdown inside Saudi Arabia. But the fact that the government approved high-level military training for operatives who went on to carry out the grisly killing of a journalist shows how intensely intertwined the United States has become with an autocratic nation even as its agents committed horrific human rights abuses.\n It also underscores the perils of military partnerships with repressive governments and demonstrates how little oversight exists for those forces after they return home.\n Such issues are likely to continue as American private military contractors increasingly look to foreign clients to shore up their business as the United States scales back overseas deployments after two decades of war.\n The State Department initially granted a license for the paramilitary training of the Saudi Royal Guard to Tier 1 Group starting in 2014, during the Obama administration. The training continued during at least the first year of former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s term.\n Louis Bremer, a senior executive of Cerberus, Tier 1 Group\u2019s parent company, confirmed his company\u2019s role in the training last year in written answers to questions from lawmakers as part of his nomination for a top Pentagon job during the Trump administration.\n The administration does not appear to have sent the document to Congress before withdrawing Mr. Bremer\u2019s nomination; lawmakers never received answers to their questions.\n In the document, which Mr. Bremer provided to The New York Times, he said that four members of the Khashoggi kill team had received Tier 1 Group training in 2017, and two of them had participated in a previous iteration of the training, which went from October 2014 until January 2015.\n \u201cThe training provided was unrelated to their subsequent heinous acts,\u201d Mr. Bremer said in his responses.\n He said that a March 2019 review by Tier 1 Group \u201cuncovered no wrongdoing by the company and confirmed that the established curriculum training was unrelated to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.\u201d\n  Mr. Bremer said that the State Department, \u201cin collaboration with other U.S. departments and agencies,\u201d is responsible for vetting the foreign forces trained on U.S. soil. \u201cAll foreign personnel trained by T1G are cleared by the U.S. government for entry into the United States before commencement of training.\u201d\n In a statement, Mr. Bremer said that the training was \u201cprotective in nature\u201d and that the company conducted no further training of Saudis after December 2017.\n \u201cT1G management, the board and I stand firmly with the U.S. government, the American people and the international community in condemning the horrific murder of Jamal Khashoggi,\u201d he said.\n A 2019 column by David Ignatius of The Washington Post first reported that members of the Khashoggi kill team had received training in the United States. He wrote that the C.I.A. had \u201ccautioned other government agencies\u201d that some special-operations training may have been conducted by Tier 1 Group under a State Department license.\n The issue was central to Mr. Bremer\u2019s contentious confirmation hearing and the written questions from senators, asking him what role, if any, Tier 1 Group had in training Saudis who had participated in the Khashoggi operation.\n A State Department spokesman declined to confirm whether it awarded licenses to Tier 1 Group for the Saudi training.\n \u201cThis administration insists on responsible use of U.S. origin defense equipment and training by our allies and partners, and considers appropriate responses if violations occur,\u201d said the spokesman, Ned Price. \u201cSaudi Arabia faces significant threats to its territory, and we are committed to working together to help Riyadh strengthen its defenses.\u201d\n  Mr. Trump weighed  installing the head of Cerberus, Stephen A. Feinberg, in a top intelligence post last year, but the appointment was never made. While the Trump administration had appointed Mr. Feinberg to lead the President\u2019s Intelligence Advisory Board in 2018, questions emerged about potential conflicts of interest. Cerberus  formerly owned the military contractor DynCorp, which among other things provides intelligence advice to the United States and other clients.\n It is unclear which members of the Khashoggi kill team participated in the Tier 1 Group training. Seven members of the team belonged to an elite unit charged with protecting Prince Mohammed, according to an American  intelligence report about the assassination declassified in February.\n The role of operatives from the so-called Rapid Intervention Force in the Khashoggi killing helped bolster the American intelligence case that Prince Mohammed approved the operation.\n \u201cMembers of the R.I.F. would not have participated\u201d in the killing without his consent, according to the report. The group \u201cexists to defend the crown prince\u201d and \u201canswers only to him,\u201d the document said.\n Members of the team that killed Mr. Khashoggi were involved in at least a dozen operations starting in 2017, according to officials who have read classified intelligence reports about the campaign.\n Mr. Khashoggi, a columnist for The Post, was killed inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in October 2018, his body dismembered using a bone saw. The assassination brought widespread condemnation on Prince Mohammed, who has publicly denied any knowledge of the operation.\n  Eight defendants  were sentenced to up to two decades in prison last year, but human rights advocates criticized the punishments as aimed at lower-level agents while sparing their leaders.\n The C.I.A. concluded that the prince directed the operation, but Mr. Trump said that the evidence was inconclusive and that America\u2019s  diplomatic and economic relationship with the kingdom took priority. After President Biden took office and debated the issue with his advisers before the release of the declassified intelligence report, his administration announced sanctions on Saudis involved in the killing, including members of the elite unit who protect Prince Mohammed, but chose not to directly punish the crown prince.\n The earlier iteration of the training, which took place during the Obama administration, occurred before Prince Mohammed consolidated power in the kingdom. His predecessor as crown prince, Mohammed bin Nayef, was a close ally of the United States and in particular John O. Brennan, who served as C.I.A. director under President Barack Obama.\n Prince bin Nayef was the Saudi counterterrorism chief and collaborated closely with Obama administration officials in working to dismantle Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terrorist group\u2019s affiliate based in Yemen.\n In 2017, Prince bin Salman pushed Prince bin Nayef from power and executed a broader campaign to wrest power from his rivals \u2014 including a notorious episode of imprisoning Saudi royals and businessmen at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh.\n The Trump administration considered him a valuable partner in the Middle East \u2014 especially for the administration\u2019s strategy to isolate Iran \u2014 and Prince bin Salman developed a close relationship with Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law who served as a senior adviser to Mr. Trump.\n  Prince bin Salman, the son of King Salman, is the next in line to the Saudi throne. Prince bin Nayef remains under house arrest in the kingdom.\n The  Tier 1 Group website lists numerous American special operations and intelligence units as clients, along with \u201cspecialty units that do not require recognition.\u201d It said it also trains \u201cOGA special operator teams\u201d \u2014 one pseudonym for C.I.A. paramilitary units \u2014 as well as \u201cinternational allied forces.\u201d\n Under federal rules that restrict foreign sales of American arms and military expertise, Tier 1 Group was required to apply for licenses to train the foreign operatives. Those license applications were examined by State Department officials \u2014 who were processing tens of thousands of licenses per year \u2014 and approved.\n The approval would have allowed members of the Saudi Royal Guard to enter the United States on visas processed by the American Embassy in Riyadh. The path is similar to the one followed by Second Lt. Mohammed Alshamrani, a Royal Saudi Air Force officer who  opened fire in 2019 at a naval air station in Pensacola, Fla., where he was receiving military flight training. The attack killed three people and wounded eight.\n Tier 1 Group was founded to train U.S. military personnel, taking advantage of an expanded Pentagon budget for military personnel training in basic counterinsurgency skills, according to former American officials familiar with its operations.\n One of the company\u2019s founders, Steve Reichert, a former Marine, was working as an instructor for the security contractor then known as Blackwater when he met Mr. Feinberg. With Mr. Feinberg\u2019s backing, Mr. Reichert set up Tier 1 Group, according to Mr. Reichert\u2019s  2020 account of the company\u2019s founding and former intelligence officials familiar with the efforts.\n But as U.S. military training budgets began to shrink, the company, like other private security firms, began searching for new clients. By 2014, it was beginning to train foreign military units, including Saudis.\n Decisions about granting licenses to American firms to train foreign nationals are usually made after getting input from numerous government agencies, said R. Clarke Cooper, the assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs during the Trump administration. The Pentagon and intelligence agencies often play a role, he said.\n \u201cThese things don\u2019t just come out of the ether,\u201d he said.\n Mr. Cooper said he could not recall any discussion about the Tier 1 Group training of Saudis, even after Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing. He said there were intense deliberations inside the Trump administration about how to respond to the killing after the government concluded that Prince Mohammed most likely approved it.\n In the end, he said, administration officials did not want to squander America\u2019s relationship with the kingdom \u2014 and the strategy of isolating Iran \u2014 by taking a heavy-handed approach after Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n \u201cNo government is going to flush a significant bilateral relationship over this murder, no matter how horrific it was,\u201d he said.", "posttime": "2021-06-23

", "note_en": "Skip to main content                                                                                                                When Paul McBeth first started playing in professional disc golf tournaments, he\u2019d crisscross California in his father\u2019s 1978 Dodge Ramcharger. His dad had mostly used it to rock-crawl in the desert outskirts of Los Angeles. The top of the SUV was sawed off and the side windows were smashed out. The doors were so dented they looked like topographic maps. The windshield was scarred, and the gas pedal was missing. When storm clouds gathered, Paul kicked a metal bar to the floor as he tried to outrun the rain.\n His next few cars weren\u2019t much nicer. When he was 19, he found out a friend was planning to dump an Infiniti I30 in the scrapyard and offered to pay him $500 for it. McBeth drove it from L.A. to Kansas City for the  2009 Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA) world championships and  almost all the way back. It blew a gasket 30 minutes from his house. Then there was his Ford Thunderbird that overheated every half-hour on the highway, and his camper van that he thought would save him money on hotels but ended up costing him at the gas pump.\n Finally, in 2011, after winning $4,000 for taking first place at the Memorial Championship in Scottsdale, Arizona, McBeth had saved enough money to buy a new car. He wanted a Jeep Patriot. The problem was the paperwork. \u201cUnder occupation, I put \u2018professional athlete,\u2019\u201d McBeth says. \u201cI guess they didn\u2019t believe me because they wouldn\u2019t let me finance it. I ended up having to buy the car with cash.\u201d\n In the decade since, McBeth\u2019s disc golf career has soared. He\u2019s won the PDGA world championship five times and the United States Disc Golf championship twice. In 2010, the PDGA championship\u2019s total purse was  $33,782; at this week\u2019s event, the men\u2019s winnings are expected to be upward of  $150,000. McBeth has earned more than  half a million dollars from his performances. He is, undoubtedly, the most accomplished disc golfer in the world.\n But except to a subset of hardcore frisbee fans, his more impressive accomplishments have come away from the course. In February, disc golf manufacturer Discraft announced it had extended McBeth\u2019s endorsement deal to a  guaranteed  $10 million over 10 years. McBeth also has sponsors for other disc golf gear, such as grip equipment and bags, and owns part of a company called Foundation Disc Golf that produces both products and content. He has deals outside of disc golf equipment too, with the likes of Adidas and Celsius energy drink. According to 2019 data from the  athlete marketing platform Opendorse, only about 70 athletes in the world make at least a million dollars a year in endorsement deals. McBeth\u2019s endorsement income from Discraft alone puts him on par with Bears linebacker Khalil Mack, Jazz guard Mike Conley Jr., and Astros pitcher Justin Verlander.\n \u201cUnder occupation, I put \u2018professional athlete.\u2019 I guess they didn\u2019t believe me because they wouldn\u2019t let me finance it. I ended up having to buy the car with cash.\u201d \u2014Paul McBeth\n McBeth has carved out a lucrative career in a niche sport, in part as an athlete and in part as an influencer. He isn\u2019t alone in using this blueprint. Competitors in sports ranging from bowling to lacrosse have been able to amass riches by building their brands\u2014and growing the games they love along the way.\n \u201cI think about it as a three-step funnel,\u201d says Li Jin, the founder of the digital marketing platform Atelier Ventures who coined the term \u201cPassion Economy\u201d to describe how influencers monetize social media. The first step is to attract a big audience on a known platform, like Instagram or Twitter. The second is to bring them to a platform the influencer owns, such as a newsletter or podcast. The final step is to turn people into paying customers. \u201cThat,\u201d she says, \u201cis how influencers turn social capital into financial capital.\u201d\n McBeth agreed to that $10 million deal in July 2020 after hosting a paintball party for his 30th birthday. A couple of months later, he signed the paperwork at Discraft\u2019s headquarters in Michigan. In November, he shared a  series of stories with his 150,000-plus Instagram followers. The first showed a trailer from a car dealership in Michigan. The second and third showed glamorous shots of his latest car purchase: a McLaren 570S Spider. The luxury convertible\u2014which starts at more than $200,000\u2014has switchblade doors and a retractable roof.\n   By now you may have started browsing for disc golf gear in another tab. But before you complete your order, you first need to figure out how to get anyone\u2019s attention. Not long ago, niche sports cracked the national consciousness only as punch lines. In a now-iconic  Seinfeld episode, George Costanza gets a severance package from the Yankees\u2014enough to sustain him for an entire summer\u2014and tells Jerry he\u2019s going to learn to play frolf.\n    In the 2004 comedy  Dodgeball, Vince Vaughn\u2019s group of misfits face off against Ben Stiller\u2019s crew of hulking weightlifters on a fictional channel called ESPN 8: The Ocho. The parody network became such a cultural phenomenon that in 2017 ESPN launched an annual \u201c Ocho TV\u201d day, featuring events like the National Stone Skipping Competition and World Sign Spinning Championship. (How sign spinning became an international competition before stone skipping is a mystery best explored in a separate story.) But those so-called joke sports have had the last laugh. From 2017 to 2019, ESPN\u2019s the Ocho ratings  climbed year over year. Last May, a deadlift world record attempt drew more than  300,000 viewers\u2014the network\u2019s most-watched program of the day.\n For many niche sports, television is still seen as the ultimate status symbol. Some leagues have gone so far as to buy air time for their biggest events. Last year, Dynamic Discs paid the CBS Sports Network \u201c in excess of six figures\u201d to broadcast their disc golf tournament. This stands in contrast to networks\u2019 relationships with the more prominent sports leagues. In March, the NFL  secured $113 billion from its television partners for the rights to air football games over the next 11 years.\n But television isn\u2019t the only way to command mass attention. For smaller sports and their stars, social media provides access to massive audiences without traditional gatekeepers. \u201cTo millions of kids, TikTok and YouTube are mainstream entertainment. They don\u2019t watch TV,\u201d says Taylor Lorenz, who covers social media, Gen Z, and influencers for  The New York Times. \u201cSometimes you need to get onto TV to get credibility with boomer CEOs. But for individuals, you can often monetize better on your social media.\u201d\n  The surest path to profitability is to go viral. And the kings of the viral clip are the dudes from Dude Perfect. What began as a series of stunts by college roommates at Texas A&amp;M has turned into the most popular sports channel on YouTube. Dude Perfect has nearly twice as many subscribers (56 million) as four major U.S. sports leagues\u2014the NBA (16.7 million), NFL (7.8 million), MLB (3.0 million), and NHL (1.6 million)\u2014combined. Its  water bottle flips and  ping-pong tricks have reshaped what constitutes athletic accomplishment online. And its influence echoes across the niche sports landscape. (The dudes declined to be interviewed for this story.)\n McBeth is friends and business partners with Brodie Smith, a former ultimate player who became internet famous for his frisbee trick shots and has collaborated on three videos with Dude Perfect. Smith, who boasts more than 2 million YouTube subscribers and almost a million Instagram and Twitter followers, instantly became the world\u2019s most famous disc golf player when he turned pro in late 2019. Smith has documented his journey into the sport, and has learned the finer points of the game from McBeth. In exchange, Smith has schooled McBeth on the finer points of internet fame. \u201cBrodie has made everyone in disc golf up their YouTube game,\u201d McBeth says. \u201cHe\u2019s inspired me a lot. We used to try to find the time to post videos when we could. Now we make the time. It\u2019s become a priority.\u201d\n  Jason Belmonte, the most accomplished professional bowler in the world, has collaborated on two videos with Dude Perfect. The first\u2014which shows him whizzing bowling balls past the dudes\u2019 heads and breaking flying plates with bowling pins\u2014has accumulated almost 100 million views. According to  Aux Mode, a digital service that projects the value of YouTube videos, 100 million views translates to about $400,000 of revenue. The popularity of a channel and its engagement rate can increase the value of those videos even further.\n  \u201cSome people in my fan base can recite every single stunt I performed in those videos but don\u2019t know how many titles I\u2019ve won,\u201d says Belmonte, who\u2019s captured 25 Professional Bowlers Association titles, including a record 13 major championships. \u201cEntertainment is king right now. Whether you\u2019re bowling around a dude\u2019s head or doing the world\u2019s longest strike, entertainment is what sticks in people\u2019s minds.\u201d\n Until television rights deals increase enough to start funding substantial salaries in niche sports, social media is the best way for these athletes to earn a living. Life-changing money  is out there, but they do have to earn it.\n  When Jennifer Delaney was a little girl, her father fastened a string to two ends of a stick to create a makeshift bow and instill in her a love of archery. As an MBA candidate at SMU, she rediscovered this passion as a way to relieve her stress from school and networking events. Her mother thought she should have taken up a \u201cnormal\u201d sport, like golf. In the beginning, Delaney wondered whether she was right. \u201cFor the first few months, I had bruises and blood blisters on my hands and fingers,\u201d Delaney says. \u201cI got mosquito bites from being outside so much. I got torn up.\u201d\n  To break up the monotony of practice, she started imagining more intricate targets. She launched a TikTok account called Freedom and Feathers, and made a video in which she  shot a swinging tic tac into a tic-tac-toe board. She has used arrows to  light a match and  blow out a candle. In her most popular video, which has more than 7 million views, she tosses a tennis ball in the air and pierces it as it descends. Delaney does this on top of her day job as a consultant, and estimates she spends between 30 minutes and a full weekend purchasing supplies and constructing targets. Filming the videos can take anywhere from a few minutes\u2014she shot through a Life Saver on her third try\u2014to a few days. And the process doesn\u2019t end there.\n Every time she posts a video to her nearly 1 million TikTok followers, Delaney sets a goal to respond to at least 50 comments. Even though she keeps a note on her phone with standard responses to FAQs, she can\u2019t ever clear her backlog of DMs. Still, she spends hours a day responding, because she sees how it inspires girls to get into the sport, and she wants to create a sense of community.\n \u201cHow do small sports become big ones? I got interested in that question because I really love disc golf,\u201d says Joshua Woods, a sociology professor at West Virginia who studies alternative sports and serves as the editor of the disc golf website  Parked. \u201cAnd that\u2019s part of the answer to the question: a critical mass of people become emotionally connected to a sport. People like Paul McBeth are getting paid because they can cut through the noise, and there\u2019s so much noise in the age of the internet. Passionate fans can feel like they\u2019re part of an intimate community.\u201d\n Even the most active NBA fans don\u2019t expect stars to respond to social media messages. (Unless they have talked shit about Kevin Durant, in which case they\u2019ll absolutely hear back. Hi, KD.) But the fans of niche sports sometimes feel a sense of ownership over those sports, and a sense of entitlement when interacting with their stars. Spending so much time sorting through comments can make it hard for those athletes to filter out the trolls. Delaney says that she gets daily sexist messages from men who claim what she does is easy. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018Big deal, someone has already done that particular shot.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Basketball players have made shots from every spot on the floor. That doesn\u2019t make a half-court shot any less impressive.\u2019\u201d\n \u201cSome people in my fan base can recite every single stunt I performed in those videos but don\u2019t know how many titles I\u2019ve won. Entertainment is king right now.\u201d \u2014Jason Belmonte\n When Belmonte first started bowling as a child, he couldn\u2019t lift the ball, so he pioneered the practice of bowling with both hands. While most players bowl using a single arm, Belmonte  uses both to improve his power and control. That style makes him stand out the way Rick Barry once did with his underhanded free throw shooting. When Belmonte began competing professionally, he was inundated with comments about his form. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how you can scroll right past a thousand positive comments and focus on the one negative comment you see,\u201d he says. \u201cIt took me a long time to learn how to deal with that.\u201d\n He later learned that some of those online trolls were actually his competitors in the lanes. He says that several times he\u2019s walked into the locker room\u2014yes, there are locker rooms for bowlers\u2014and overheard other bowlers whispering about how they\u2019d created burner accounts to harass him. \u201cI used to tell them \u2018Don\u2019t hide behind a username. Say it to my face.\u2019  Then they\u2019d deny it,\u201d Belmonte says. \u201cNow my reply is \u2018I have more of everything than you do. There\u2019s nothing you have that I would want.\u2019\u201d\n Belmonte also credits his unusual style for his success on social media. He\u2019s by far the most popular bowler across all of the major platforms, with 130,000 Instagram followers, 44,000 Twitter followers, and 66,000 YouTube subscribers. His bios online tout his unusual style, and his email signature reads, \u201cThis email was typed using #2HANDS.\u201d He has double-handedly changed the game of bowling for professionals and amateurs alike, many of whom trace their ability to enjoy the sport to his trailblazing style. That sense of community can be lucrative for Belmonte, who regularly releases  limited-edition merchandise for $25 to $60 on Instagram. He says those sales, which number in the thousands every year, provide \u201cfantastic supplementary income.\u201d\n \u201cIn niche sports, social media is 10 times\u2014maybe 100 times\u2014more important to an athlete than it is in mainstream sports,\u201d Belmonte says. \u201cMainstream sports stars get constant TV coverage. They\u2019re in people\u2019s faces all the time. If you\u2019re in a niche sport, you have to tell people what you have coming up and what you\u2019ve achieved. You want people to feel like they\u2019re a part of this journey.\u201d\n  As she was languishing last summer before her freshman year at Aquinas College in Michigan, volleyball player Chloe Mitchell decided\u2014like so many of us during the pandemic\u2014that she had seen just about enough of her family. Behind her house was a storage space with dusty walls and rusty bicycles, so she asked her parents for permission to convert it into a \u201cshe shed.\u201d She\u2019d recently gotten into TikTok, and posted a video documenting the change to her account. Within four days, it had accumulated a million views. By the time the shed was transformed, so too was her life. She had more than a million followers, and no idea what to do next.\n @chloevmitchell  It\u2019s DONEEEE! Thank you for watching the process and having fun with me. Check out the link in my bio if you want to see a longer she shed tour :))\n  \u266c Funky Town - The Dance Queen Group\n She didn\u2019t want to be a one-clip wonder, so she took a couple weeks off before coming back with a new project: remodeling the bathroom that she shared with her brother. \u201cI had this massive decrease in followers after the first project was finished,\u201d she says. \u201cBeing a TikTok star had  just happened, and it wasn\u2019t part of my identity. When my followers started going back up after my second project, I knew I could sustain something.\u201d\n  Mitchell\u2019s fame had nothing to do with volleyball. Nonetheless, NCAA name, image, and likeness (NIL) rules would have prevented her from collecting any profits from her social media success. During recruiting, Mitchell nearly committed to an NCAA Division II school, which would\u2019ve cost her dearly. Instead, she chose to compete at the NAIA level, which  granted athletes NIL rights in October 2020. Mitchell is now  believed to be the first college athlete to make money from endorsements. (Well,   legal money anyway.) Since then, she has earned enough to buy a laptop and a car, as well as pay off her student debt. She\u2019s saving up for her next project: flipping a house.\n As soon as this summer, NCAA athletes in states such as Florida and Mississippi will gain NIL rights. Sensing that seismic shift in the economics of college sports, Mitchell and her father, Keith, founded a company called PlayBooked. PlayBooked already has four full-time employees and has connected more than 130 NAIA athletes to paid social media sponsorship opportunities. Keith is so bullish on its prospects he turned down venture capital funding and predicts that there will be a PlayBooked Bowl by 2025.\n For athletes in niche sports, their college tenures often represent the peak of their popularity. Being able to make endorsement money, then, would be an absolute game-changer. \u201cThe riches,\u201d Keith says, \u201care in the niches.\u201d\n Myles Jones first started getting interested in Instagram while he was playing lacrosse at Duke. Every time his team played on ESPNU, he\u2019d return to his phone to discover a few hundred additional followers. He was majoring in marketing at the time, and wanted to test his ability to build his own brand. He was so successful that on the day after his 2016 graduation, STX Lacrosse representatives flew out to ink him to an endorsement deal. Within a few months, he\u2019d also signed with Adidas and made a few thousand dollars for promoting a protein powder on Instagram.\n \u201cIn niche sports, social media is 10 times\u2014maybe 100 times\u2014more important to an athlete than it is in mainstream sports. You want people to feel like they\u2019re a part of this journey.\u201d \u2014Jason Belmonte\n In November, Jones signed a major endorsement deal with Degree. He declined to reveal the exact dollar figure involved, but said he thought his agent had typed an extra zero at the end of the number when he read the text confirming the details. Yet Jones says the meaning of the deal was as significant as the money. \u201cI was stepping into the non-endemic space. A lot of what guys are selling in lacrosse is equipment\u2014sticks and goals. I felt like I was bridging the gap between a small sport and the mainstream culture. You can\u2019t buy lacrosse gear at the supermarket, but everybody needs deodorant.\u201d\n Even in mainstream sports, most athletes rely on apparel companies like Nike or Adidas as their primary sponsors. And while deals like LeBron James\u2019s lifetime contract with Nike make national headlines, most athletes have what are known as merchandise deals. They don\u2019t get money, but they get as many products as they want. Only the big names receive cash deals, and even then the payout\u2014in the low six figures, if they\u2019re lucky\u2014is generally pennies compared to their contracts. Only the megastars make millions from endorsements.\n Yet while mainstream athletes often live off their sport salaries alone, niche sport athletes typically have to rely on multiple income streams.

But  faced with five antitrust bills that could unwind  what the House Judiciary Committee described as Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook\u2019s \u201cmonopoly power,\u201d Big Tech is bringing out the big lobbying guns.\n Apple CEO Tim Cook himself called Speaker Nancy Pelosi to \u201cdeliver a warning\u201d that that the \u201crushed\u201d antitrust bills could disrupt the iPhone,  according to  The New York Times , and that\u2019s not all:\n \u201cExecutives, lobbyists, and more than a dozen think tanks and advocacy groups paid by tech companies have swarmed Capitol offices, called and emailed lawmakers and their staff members, and written letters arguing there will be dire consequences for the industry and the country if the ideas become law,\u201d the NYT wrote.\n There\u2019s a growing sense that the current administration has a genuine interest in combating tech monopolies \u2014 a point perhaps made most clearly when Biden chose prominent antitrust scholar and Amazon critic Lina Khan to lead the Federal Trade Commission.  She was sworn in last week.\n  It\u2019s not unusual for tech companies to dive deeper into lobbying these days, as you\u2019d expect now that they\u2019re the most valuable companies in the world, and we\u2019ve seen their outsize influence overwhelm voters and legislators at the local level before. Uber and Lyft won big  after backing the most expensive measure in California history, using their own apps  as an unfair advantage, and Arizona\u2019s controversial app store bill  mysteriously disappeared after tech companies stepped in. An Apple lobbyist managed to  scare California legislators away from a right-to-repair bill in 2019, too.\n Pelosi apparently wasn\u2019t having it, though, at least not on the call.

", "note_en": "Programming     My previous article, \u201c We don\u2019t need a string type\u201c, caused a bit of stir. Though the feedback is mixed, there is a common theme of a string being a useful feature. After doing a bit more research I can determine only one thing: most current string types are broken!\n Many of us believe our strings are capable of more than what they actually do. We rely on their functionality without actually checking that its valid. This can easily lead to programs which do not work correctly, particularly with respect to internationalization. In most cases it seems we would be better off without a string type.\n  I looked at how strings behave in a few basic situations. I\u2019ll go over each situation, giving the expected result and some of the actual results. I considered showing a matrix with the results, but since all the tested languages behave so poorly it didn\u2019t seem useful.\n  Using the text \u201cnoe\u0308l\u201d with a decomposed Unicode string \u201cnoe\\u0308l\u201d, I checked the following:\n 1. Does it print correctly? Yes, most languages are capable of doing this. Though the ideone.com interface seems to break the output (so be careful with testing).\n 2. What is the reverse? \u201cl\u00ebon\u201d, correct? Mostly this fails. The most common result is \u201cl\u0308eon\u201d (the dieresis is on the \u2018l\u2019 instead of the \u2018e\u2019). This is what happens without a string class, by just reversing an array of code points.\n 3. What are the first three characters? Mostly the answer here is \u201cnoe\u201d, as opposed to the desired \u201cno\u00eb\u201d. This could easily lead into a big discussion about what a character is, but I assume most people would not be happy with the current result. This is again indicative of a string type which merely treats the data as an array of code points.\n 4. What is the length? The common answer is 5. And yet again, this indicates our string types are merely arrays of characters and not truly handling the text.\n For all of these questions, try to consider what should happen if you were editing this text in your favourite word processor or text editor. I generally expect that the \u2018\u00eb\u2019 character is handled as a single entity. I don\u2019t expect backspace/delete to just remove part of the letter. I expect copying the first three letters to include the accent.\n  It was a bit weird to find out that Unicode has cats in it (I hope you have a font which shows them \u2014 if not, the title of this section is a happy cat and a sad cat, part of the Unicode emoticon set). These characters were chosen since they are outside of the BMP (basic multilingual plane). This spells trouble for languages using UTF-16 encodings (Java, C#, JavaScript).\n 1. Length? Python unicode correctly reports 2. Those UTF-16 languages tend to report 4: the characters require surrogate pairs.\n 2. Substring after the first character? Python unicode correctly reports the sad cat \u201c\ud83d\ude3e\u201d. The UTF-16 languages produce invalid strings with a half-surrogate followed by the sad cat.\n 3. Reverse? Python unicode gets the correct reverse of \u201c\ud83d\ude3e\ud83d\ude38\u201d. The UTF-16 languages produce invalid strings. With C# I think I uncovered a defect in ideone. It doesn\u2019t even show the invalid string and instead shows no output at all for the entire program! [ ideone defect]\n Languages using an encoding agnostic library, like C++, Perl, and normal Python 2 strings, fail here as well. They ignore any encoding and assume the string is an array of 1-byte code points. Python 3 adopted unicode as the default string type, thus fixing some problems. It appears that Perl also has a \u2018utf8\u2019 mode which fixes problems for these cats, but not for the \u201cno\u00ebl\u201d string.\n  This string contains a ligature character, the \u201cffl\u201d part is a single unicode code point. They exist mainly for compatibility, but they are a good test for case conversion.\n 1. What is the uppercase? I did not find any language which doesn\u2019t print \u201cBA\ufb04E\u201d. Notice the ligature remains lowercase. The expected answer is of course \u201cBAFFLE\u201d.\n Unicode has a special class of case conversion: this single ligature code point is actually converted to three code points. By not following these additional rules, a language uppercase function produces an interesting result: a string converted to uppercase still has lowercase characters in it.\n  A final check I did was to compare two logically equivalent strings with different composition forms. Here \u201cno\u00ebl\u201d is using the precomposed \u201c\u00eb\u201d character.\n 1. Is precomposed == decomposed? The answer is no in all tests. However, several languages do offer Unicode normalization libraries. In those languages the normal form of the strings does compare equal. JavaScript does not have such a library, which is really tragic because it\u2019s primarily a UI language, exactly where\u2019d you want proper unicode functionality.\n It\u2019s tempting to argue that normalization and lexical analysis is not part of the basic string type. But these seem like fundamental operations one would want to do with text. If they aren\u2019t included, what exactly is the purpose of the string type?\n  I encourage you to run such tests in your favourite language. If you are doing work with international text it is vital that you understand what your \u2018string\u2019 type is actually doing. Once you\u2019ve run this you should reconsider what your \u201cstring\u201d type is actually doing for you. In my opinion they\u2019re all broken.\n I admit the correct answer is not always clear. Text processing is a difficult topic, and at the very minimum we\u2019d have to cover grapheme clusters (some string classes expose functionality relating to this, and Perl even has a GCString class). This is beyond the scope of this article, but very relevant for a good string type.\n The point I made in my previous article becomes more poignant. I\u2019d rather have an array of characters than a broken string class. I don\u2019t put any false expectations on an array of characters: the results it produces for the above tests are very logical.

Clinically, the life-long presence of the parasite in tissues of a majority of infected individuals is usually considered asymptomatic. However, a number of studies show that this \u2018asymptomatic infection\u2019 may also lead to development of other human pathologies.\n The purpose of the study was to collect available geoepidemiological data on seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis and search for its relationship with mortality and disability rates in different countries.\n Prevalence data published between 1995\u20132008 for women in child-bearing age were collected for 88 countries (29 European). The association between prevalence of toxoplasmosis and specific disease burden estimated with age-standardized Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) or with mortality, was calculated using General Linear Method with Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDP), geolatitude and humidity as covariates, and also using nonparametric partial Kendall correlation test with GDP as a covariate. The prevalence of toxoplasmosis correlated with specific disease burden in particular countries explaining 23% of variability in disease burden in Europe. The analyses revealed that for example, DALY of 23 of 128 analyzed diseases and disease categories on the WHO list showed correlations (18 positive, 5 negative) with prevalence of toxoplasmosis and another 12 diseases showed positive trends (p&lt;0.1). For several obtained significant correlations between the seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis and specific diseases/clinical entities, possible pathophysiological, biochemical and molecular explanations are presented.\n The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis correlated with various disease burden. Statistical associations does not necessarily mean causality. The precautionary principle suggests however that possible role of toxoplasmosis as a triggering factor responsible for development of several clinical entities deserves much more attention and financial support both in everyday medical practice and future clinical research.\n Toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by the obligate apicomplexan intracellular protozoan  Toxoplasma gondii, is one of the world&#39;s most common parasites infecting most genera of warm-blooded animals (more than 30 species of birds and 300 species of mammals). It is the most prevalent infection in humans (estimated to be 30\u201350% of the world population), more than latent tuberculosis which infects about one-third of the human population (WHO,  www.who.int/entity/tb/publications/2009/tbfactsheet_2009update_one_page.pdf, accessed July 2013). The definitive hosts are representatives of the felid (cat) family. Nicolle and Manceaux (1908) first observed the parasites in the blood and tissues of a North African rodent,  Ctenodactylus gondii, and named it  Toxoplasma (arclike form)  gondii (after the rodent host)  [1]. There are three infective stages of  T. gondii: a) a rapidly dividing invasive tachyzoite; b) a slowly dividing bradyzoite in tissue cysts, which can persist inside human cells for protracted periods; and c) an environmental stage, the sporozoite, protected inside an oocyst. The oocysts, remarkably stable environmentally, are transmitted to other hosts through inadvertent ingestion.\n Seroprevalence is a measure of the accumulated exposure during a person&#39;s lifetime in a particular social setting. Most of the more than one third of the world&#39;s human population who are infected with  T. gondii remain asymptomatic because the immune system usually keeps the parasite from causing illness. Chronic, usually lifelong, infection with  Toxoplasma that is not accompanied with overt clinical symptoms of toxoplasmosis disease is termed latent toxoplasmosis while chronic infection associated with continuous or recurrent clinical symptoms is termed chronic toxoplasmosis (this form of disease is relatively rare in Europe and Northern America). Worldwide seroprevalence of the parasite measured by specific anti- Toxoplasma IgG antibodies varies between 1% and 100% depending on the environmental and socioeconomic conditions, including eating habits and health-related practices  \u2013 , general level of hygiene, host susceptibility, geographical location (geolatitude) and humidity of the soil. The incidence of infection is higher in warmer and humid climates and increases with age  . The lowest seroprevalence (\u223c1%) was found in some countries in the Far East and the highest (&gt;90%) in some parts of European and South American countries. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported an overall seroprevalence of 11% [National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey between 1999 and 2004]; another survey reported a higher number (22.5%)  . Nevertheless, toxoplasmosis is one of the leading causes of death attributed to foodborne illness  . In European countries, the prevalence ranges between 10% to 60%, and in some regions as high as 90%  [8]. In one study, 84% of pregnant women had serum antibodies against the parasite  [3]. Data from 88 countries are presented in   Table 1; most of the published data on seroprevalence are in women of childbearing age and/or those who are pregnant.\n The second and third column show prevalence of toxoplasmosis and prevalence adjusted to a standard age of 22 years to account for variation in childbearing age in across countries (column 1) using the formula Prevalence adj\u200a=\u200a1\u2212(1\u2212Prevalence)\u2227(22/childbearing age)  . Column 5 shows year(s) when the study was performed and column 6 shows number of women in the sample. For Macedonia, the 2004 WHO data were not available therefore this 30 th European country was not included in our data set.\n In the majority of the human populations, the parasite seroprevalence increases with age, and may vary by gender  ,  [94]. Latitudinal variability in the geoseroprevalence of the parasite may be due to local rainy conditions (because oocysts live longer in humid conditions), and low altitude regions (especially at mid-latitudes); a north-south seroprevalence gradient has also been reported in animals  ,  ,  .\n The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis is high in immunocompromised patients, such as those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and transplant or cancer patients treated with immunosuppressive agents  ,  ,  .\n It may be pointed out that the different serological methods used to obtain prevalence data are not standardized, and vary in sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. As a consequence, no two tests produce the same results in all cases, even when carried out in the same laboratory  .\n T. gondii strains are highly diverse but only a few lineages are widely spread. Different genotypes of the parasite show great diversity in pathogenicity and drug sensitivity. Some atypical strains have also been detected. In Europe, North America, and Africa, there are three dominant clonal lineages of  T. gondii called type I (RH, GT1,CAST), type II (ME49, WIL, HART), and type III (VEG, MOO, SOU), as well as many atypical genotypes which differ in prevalence, virulence, migratory capacity within the host, and ability to convert to the bradyzoite cyst phase  \u2013 . Different strains of the parasite induce different cytokine responses  , thus triggering development of various clinical and biochemical disturbances in the host, including modulation of the host cell proteome  ,  . Mice fed as few as 1 oocyst of  T. gondii serotype I and several atypical strains died of acute toxoplasmosis within 21 days post inoculation, while some  T. gondii type II, and III strains were less virulent  . In North America, the parasite serotype II and NE-II causes congenital toxoplasmosis, while prematurity and severity of disease at birth was associated with the coccidian NE-II serotype  . This serotype was also associated with rural residence, lower socioeconomic status and Hispanic ethnicity (P&lt;0.01\u20130.001)  . A greater variety of genotypes are found in South America and Africa than in North America and Europe  ,  , suggesting that in these continents sexual replication of the parasite occurs more frequently than in any other part of the world  . This genetic divergence may contribute to the higher prevalence of seropositivity and ocular disease due to  T. gondii, as exemplified by the higher prevalence of toxoplasmosis and  Toxoplasma-induced eye disease in southern Brazil than in any other part of the world  .\n Animals are infected by eating infected animals, by ingestion of or coming in contact with feces of an infected cat, or by transmission from mother to fetus. In humans, cats are the primary source of infection (contact with fecal material), but other pets may also be the secondary source of infection  [3],  ,  [112]. The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in the Arctic region proves that  T. gondii can thrive in the absence of cats  [113].\n Contact with raw meat of infected animals, especially pork, is a more significant source of human infections in some countries, such as in Poland, where the majority of pigs, cattle and sheep (approximately 80%) test positive for  T. gondii [8],  . Transmission of the parasite can also occur by drinking municipal/well unboiled and unbottled water containing oocysts, exposure to contaminated soil, contaminated milk, exposure of children playing in sandpits, geophagia  ,  , eating raw or undercooked meat, especially venison   or rabbits  , raw oysters, clams, or mussels  , consumption of unwashed raw fruits and vegetables contaminated with the oocytes  , blood transfusion  \u2013 , maternal-fetal passage of blood cells (including placental trophoblasts)  [123],  , solid organ allografts  ,  , bone marrow transplantation  , allogeneic stem cell transplantation  , sputum  , breast milk  ,  , and semen   (thus, probably the infection may be transmitted via both vaginal and oral sex, significantly more frequently from seropositive to passive sex partner than vice-versa (P&lt;0.001)  [133]). Poor hygiene, lower socioeconomic status and less education, as well as exposure to certain strains of  T. gondii may also contribute to a higher rate of infection  .\n T. gondii is remarkable in its ability to invade a wide variety of host cells. Invasion is an active process relying on parasite motility and the sequential secretion of proteins from secretory organelles, the micronemes, rhoptries, and the dense granules.  T. gondii can invade and multiply inside any nucleated cell type including epithelial cells and blood leukocytes  . A preference to infect and multiply inside myeloid cells  in vitro has also been reported  , and several studies in mice indicate that the dendritic cells as well as monocytes/macrophages function as systemic parasite transporters (\u201cTrojan horses\u201d) during infection  \u2013 . The parasite can be transmitted from infected dendritic cells to NK cells  , and thus, low levels of NK cells found in pregnant women may suggest transmission of the parasite  . Differential infectivity and division rate of intracellular tachyzoites in human peripheral blood leukocytes and other primary human cells  in vitro has been demonstrated depending on the cell characteristics  .\n It is believed that the majority of immunocompetent individuals infected with  T.  gondii remain asymptomatic or have a subclinical course with minor symptoms  . It is nevertheless the most common food-borne parasitic infection requiring hospital treatment  , and the third most common cause of hospitalization due to food-borne infection  . Both competent and immunocompromised persons can develop the disease, especially retinochoroiditis (ocular toxoplasmosis)  ,  ,  . In non-pregnant immunocompetent adults, acute disease may also lead to impaired eye sight  ,  . For example, in the United States, one million new infections occur each year, which result in approximately 20 000 cases of retinal pathology  . Primary infection in pregnant women is a matter of great concern, since it can be transmitted to the fetus leading to spontaneous abortion or stillbirth. A newborn exposed to  T. gondii in utero may develop congenital toxoplasmosis with major ocular and neurological consequences. In immunosuppressed (HIV, organ transplant or cancer) patients, the infection can lead to life-threatening cerebral toxoplasmosis  ,  ,  .\n Symptomatic infection with the parasite can be categorized into four groups: 1) cervical lymphadenopathy, headache, fever, sore throat, and myalgia, with possibility of splenomegaly and brief erythematous (maculopapular) rash; 2) typhus-like exanthematous form with myocarditis, meningoencephalitis, atypical pneumonia and possibly death; 3) retinochoroiditis, which may be severe, requiring enucleation; and 4) central nervous system involvement  [153]. In addition, several reports suggest that  T. gondii infection may be responsible for additional wide range of symptoms, and development of several clinical entities (summarized in   Table 2).\n  Some of the clinical manifestations of  T. gondii infection may be as a result of extensive interaction of the pathogen with approximately 3000 host genes or proteins possibly because of frequent host/pathogen antigen homology that disrupts/creates/triggers host specific metabolic pathways, and finally contributes to the development of endophenotypes of different diseases  . The parasite and concomitant viral and/or bacterial infections scavenge important metabolites from host cells and/or donate other compounds to the host causing unwanted effects. In addition,  T. gondii-derived autoantibodies also play an important role in the pathology associated with the parasite  .\n Due to the fact that  T. gondii infection is omnipresent and associated with development of many pathologies in humans and animals, including the disease burden of congenital toxoplasmosis, as represented by disability-adjusted life years (DALY) being the highest among all foodborne pathogens  , the purpose of this work was to collectively evaluate available geoepidemiological data on the parasite worldwide national seroprevalence variations and their relationship with mortality and disability rates. In the analyses, gross domestic product (GDP)  per capita as a covariate was used because earlier it was argued and demonstrated that culture-level correlations need to be controlled for regional socioeconomic parameters  ,  ,  . If possible (i.e. in multivariate GLM analyses), two potential confounding variables that could strongly influence both the survival of  Toxoplasma oocysts in soil and a course of various diseases, namely the average latitude (proxy for temperature) and the average relative humidity of particular countries have also been included into the statistical models. In this study we found many positive and some negative associations between the prevalence of toxoplasmosis and various diseases burdens. The number and strength of these associations were much higher than could be expected by chance. Still, it must be emphasized that statistical association does not mean causality. Based on the finding of a statistical association between two phenomena, one cannot determine which of them is the cause and which is the effect \u2013 in other words, whether event A causes event B, or whether event B causes event A. Not only we are unable to determine whether event A causes B, or B causes A, but sometimes there is an (unknown) event C that causes both A and B. Therefore, all effects observed in the present exploratory study as well as all suggested biological or medical interpretations must be considered just as potential stimuli for the next, more focused research (search for unknown confounders and for independent evidence) that must follow.\n The data on disease burden, mortality and Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY), were obtained from the table \u201cMortality and Burden of Diseases Estimates for WHO Member States in 2004\u201d published by WHO  [323] and available at:  www.who.int/evidence/bod. The publication can be downloaded from the website:  http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/2004_report_update/en/index.html; accessed July 2013). Summary tables present the best estimates of WHO \u2013 based on the evidence available in mid-2008 \u2013 rather than from the official estimates of Member States.  Methods and data sources are summarized in the Annexes of the \u201cGlobal burden of disease: 2004 update\u201d  [323], and the methodology used is described in more details elsewhere  [324]; also available at:  http://www.dcp2.org/pubs/GBD; accessed July 2013.\n The Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) has been defined  [323] as \u201ca health gap measure that extends the concept of potential years of life lost due to premature death and also to include equivalent years of \u2018healthy\u2019 life lost by virtue of being in a state of poor health or disability.\u201d Thus, the DALY combines in one measure the time lived with disability and the time lost due to premature mortality. One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of \u2018healthy\u2019 life, while the \u2018burden of disease\u2019 as a measure of the gap between current health status and an ideal situation where everyone lives into old age free of disease and disability. The method of calculation of age-standardized DALY has been described earlier  [323].\n In the literature, most of toxoplasmosis prevalence (seroprevalence) data are available only for women in childbearing age. Therefore, all available data collected for this population were published mostly between 1995\u20132008; the final database was obtained from 88 countries (29 European). When more than one estimation of prevalence of toxoplasmosis was available for a particular country, we gave priority to multicenter studies performed between 1998\u20132004. When the studies published different prevalence data for various regions or different years we calculated an unweighted arithmetic mean. The obtained data were adjusted to a standard age 22 years to eliminate differences in prevalence caused by different childbearing ages in various countries   were kindly provided by Mudhakar Dama) using the formula:\n All statistical tests except partial Kendall correlation test were performed independently with SPSS 21 and Statistica 10.0. The association between seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis and specific disease burden estimated with age standardized DALY was calculated using nonparametric partial Kendall correlation test  [326],   with Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDP) as covariate. Because the results of similar analyses performed with the General Linear Model (GLM) method were qualitatively the same, GLM data were primarily interpreted in the Discussion section of present study. The GLM is more sensitive for the quality of data (e.g. to presence of outliers and non-Gaussian distribution of data, etc.), however, it enables to control for more than one covariate. In the present analysis, we controlled for GDP, geographical latitude and annual mean of relative humidity of particular countries using data available at  http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD (accessed 10.12. 2013) and  http://www.climatemps.com/ (accessed 2.4. 2013). No formal corrections for multiple tests were carried out, however, the fraction of significant results largely exceeded a theoretical value of 5 false positive results per 100 tests.\n The medical importance of the association was expressed as regression coefficient \u2018B\u2019, the slope of the regression line. The higher is the absolute value of B the greater is the positive or negative impact of the predictor variable (here prevalence of toxoplasmosis)\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-23 10:00:48", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5168\u7403,global,\u6570\u636e", "title": "\u5f13\u5f62\u866b\u75c5 - \u5168\u7403\u5a01\u80c1 ", "title_en": "Toxoplasmosis \u2013 A Global Threat", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3963851/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5168\u7403", "global", "\u6570\u636e"]}]
