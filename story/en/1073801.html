In the entertainment world, there’s a long lineage of comedians who tried to copy each other, failed, and became great themselves: Johnny Carson tried to copy Jack Benny, but failed and won six Emmy awards. Then, David Letterman tried to copy Johnny Carson, but failed and became one of America’s great television hosts.</p><p>这是违反直觉的，但我们模仿别人越多，我们发现自己独特风格的速度就越快。在娱乐界，有很多喜剧演员试图互相模仿，但都失败了，而且自己也变得很棒：约翰尼·卡森试图模仿杰克·本尼，但失败了，并获得了六项艾美奖。后来，大卫·莱特曼试图模仿约翰尼·卡森，但失败了，成为美国最伟大的电视主持人之一。</p><p> Reflecting on his own influences, Conan O’Brien said: “It is our failure to become our perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us unique.”</p><p>在反思自己的影响时，柯南·奥布莱恩说：“正是我们未能成为我们心目中的理想，最终定义了我们，使我们独一无二。”</p><p> Modern creators do the opposite though. They refuse to imitate others and stubbornly insist on originality, which they hold as their highest virtue — even when it comes at the expense of quality. They might deny their ambition toward originality when you talk to them, but they reveal it in their actions. In general, creators spend much less time imitating their heroes than they do trying to make something new. I call it the Originality Disease — a pervasive plague that makes creators feel scared to imitate other people’s styles.</p><p>然而，现代的创作者却恰恰相反。他们拒绝模仿他人，固执地坚持独创性，这是他们的最高美德——即使是以牺牲质量为代价。当你和他们交谈时，他们可能会否认自己对创意的渴望，但他们会在行动中表现出来。总的来说，创作者花在模仿英雄身上的时间要比尝试创造新事物的时间少得多。我称之为创意疾病——一种普遍存在的瘟疫，让创作者害怕模仿别人的风格。</p><p> The problem may be worst among writers, who speak about their craft with levels of mystery that are usually reserved for the numinous. Writers would be smart to learn from other fields, though.</p><p>这一问题在作家中可能最为严重，他们谈论自己的艺术时往往带有神秘感，而这些神秘感通常是留给年轻人的。不过，作家从其他领域学习是明智的。</p><p>   Hollywood film directors come to mind because they’re seen as the essence of what creative professionalism looks like. When people look at Quentin Tarantino, they see a mad creative with a singular talent for making original movies. But Tarantino’s originality begins with imitation. He’s famous for replicating and building upon scenes from other movies, and he once said: “I steal from every single movie ever made.”</p><p>好莱坞电影导演之所以出现在人们的脑海中，是因为他们被视为创造性职业精神的精髓。当人们看到昆汀·塔伦蒂诺时，他们会看到一个疯狂的创意者，他有着制作原创电影的独特天赋。但塔伦蒂诺的创意始于模仿。他以复制和借鉴其他电影中的场景而闻名，他曾说：“我从每一部电影中都偷东西。”</p><p> Looking at Tarantino’s work, I revel in the paradox that imitation and innovation are not opposed, but operate in tandem.</p><p>看着塔伦蒂诺的作品，我陶醉于这样一个悖论：模仿和创新不是对立的，而是相互关联的。</p><p> I don’t know about you, but I’m a “sit back, grab some popcorn, and enjoy the movie” kinda guy. Movies are pure entertainment for me. A chance to escape the world of responsibilities and enter the trance of a captivating story. I thought everybody was like this until I watched a film with a director who was the total opposite. He was attentive to all the tiny details, from the way the musical score enhanced the film’s emotional journey, to the way light moved across the actors faces, to the way camera movements foreshadowed upcoming plot developments.</p><p>我不知道你怎么样，但我是那种“坐下来，吃点爆米花，享受电影”的人。电影对我来说是纯粹的娱乐。一个逃离责任世界、进入迷人故事恍惚状态的机会。我以为每个人都是这样的，直到我和一个完全相反的导演一起看了一部电影。他注意到了所有的细节，从乐谱增强电影情感旅程的方式，到光线穿过演员脸的方式，到摄像机的移动预示着即将到来的情节发展的方式。</p><p> Listening to him reflect on the film, I had to ask: “Did we even watch the same movie?” I felt like I was stuck in flatland, while he lived in four-dimensional space. 1</p><p>听他对这部电影的反思，我不得不问：“我们看的是同一部电影吗？”当他生活在四维空间中时，我感觉自己被困在了平地上。1.</p><p> 1 A director friend tells me that in  Joker, the musical score helps us empathize with the Arthur Fleck who would eventually become the Joker. The composer Hildur Guðnadóttir used the cello in the opening scenes to create empathy with the protagonist. But then, as the Joker’s dark side and inner turmoil was revealed, the orchestra got louder and louder. The angrier he was, the bigger the orchestra became. Through it all, the music created the audience’s perception of him: simple, naive, and uncool.</p><p>1一位导演朋友告诉我，在《小丑》中，乐谱帮助我们同情最终成为小丑的阿瑟·弗莱克。作曲家Hildur Guðnadóttir在开场场景中使用大提琴来与主人公产生共鸣。但是，随着小丑黑暗的一面和内心的混乱被揭露出来，管弦乐队的声音越来越大。他越生气，管弦乐队的规模就越大。通过这一切，音乐创造了观众对他的看法：简单、天真、不酷。</p><p> From him, I learned that creators consume art differently than consumers. They’re far more intentional in what they consume. Consuming art is productive work for them. Directors watch movies not just to be entertained, but also to see how they’re made. Consciously or not, they’re developing their own mental Pinterest board of ideas to borrow and build upon in their own work.</p><p>从他那里，我了解到创作者对艺术的消费与消费者不同。他们在消费方面更加有意识。对他们来说，消费艺术是富有成效的工作。导演们看电影不仅是为了娱乐，也是为了看看电影是如何制作的。不管有没有意识，他们都在发展自己的思想体系，以便在自己的工作中借鉴和借鉴。</p><p> George Lucas comes to mind here. To create Star Wars, he went back to the teachings of Joseph Cambell, who spent his career studying mythology and religion. Through his writings, he laid out a theory of the archetypal hero which shows up in all kinds of stories throughout history. Today, it’s known as “The Hero’s Journey.” Chances are, you’re familiar with it. While writing Star Wars, Lucas drew inspiration from Campbell’s most famous book:  The Hero with a Thousand Faces. Lucas felt the triad of mythology, folklore, and fairy tales had disappeared in the West—and he wanted his new film to revive it. In order to align the story with the classical motifs that’d reverberated through so many human cultures, Lucas re-wrote his draft of  Star Wars in order to align it with Cambell’s work.</p><p>我想到乔治·卢卡斯。为了创作《星球大战》，他回到约瑟夫·坎贝尔（Joseph Cambell）的教诲中，坎贝尔的职业生涯是研究神话和宗教。通过他的作品，他提出了一种原型英雄理论，这种理论出现在历史上的各种故事中。今天，它被称为“英雄之旅”很可能，你对它很熟悉。在写《星球大战》时，卢卡斯从坎贝尔最著名的书《千面英雄》中获得了灵感。卢卡斯觉得神话、民间传说和童话的三位一体已经在西方消失了，他希望他的新电影能重振它。为了使这个故事与许多人类文化中回响的经典主题保持一致，卢卡斯重新撰写了他的《星球大战》草稿，以便与坎贝尔的作品保持一致。</p><p> Lucas’ artistic originality was enhanced by an imitative respect of Campbell’s work and the recurring themes he discovered. Had Lucas suffered from the Originality Disease that plagues so many contemporary writers, Star Wars wouldn’t be what it is today.</p><p>卢卡斯对坎贝尔作品的模仿和他发现的反复出现的主题增强了他的艺术独创性。如果卢卡斯患有困扰着许多当代作家的原创性疾病，《星球大战》就不会是今天这样了。</p><p>     The first is pretty clear: misunderstanding inspiration. Some of the juiciest inspiration comes from admiring (and maybe even  reverse-engineering) other people’s work. But many people think inspiration needs to strike out of thin air, like a bolt of lightning. They fear that the Muses of novelty won’t visit them if their mind is contaminated with what’s been done before. In blind pursuit of originality, they avoid studying anything that’s come before them out of a fear of tainting their minds with the stain of influence. Rather than standing on the shoulders of people who’ve come before them, they look within themselves for a breakthrough idea.</p><p>第一点很清楚：误解和灵感。一些最有趣的灵感来自欣赏（甚至可能是逆向工程）他人的工作。但许多人认为灵感需要像闪电一样从稀薄的空气中迸发出来。他们担心，如果他们的头脑被之前所做的事情所污染，新奇的缪斯女神将不会造访他们。在盲目追求独创性的过程中，他们避免研究任何摆在他们面前的东西，因为他们害怕用影响力的污点玷污自己的思想。他们不是站在前面的人的肩膀上，而是从内心寻找突破性的想法。</p><p> The second is more subtle: fetishizing originality. I think this part of the disease comes from academia, where people do study those who’ve come before them—but only so they can do something different. Since scholarly journals insist on original contributions, academics are incentivized to study things nobody else is studying. The challenge, though, is that originality and usefulness are not the same thing. I worry that  academics are so focused on checking the “nobody’s ever written about this before” box that they sometimes forget to make useful contributions to human knowledge.</p><p>第二个更微妙：崇拜原创。我认为这部分疾病来自学术界，在学术界，人们确实研究那些在他们之前出现的人，但只是为了让他们能做些不同的事情。由于学术期刊坚持原创，学者们被激励去研究其他人都没有研究过的东西。然而，挑战在于独创性和实用性不是一回事。我担心，学者们过于专注于检查“以前没有人写过这个”框，以至于他们有时会忘记对人类知识做出有用的贡献。</p><p> The third is pure conjecture: self-obsession. Perhaps our Originality Disease has its roots in Freud’s work, which still underpins our model of human psychology. To the extent that ideas like the ego and the subconscious seem trivial, it’s only because they’ve been so influential. Freud’s ideas basically went viral, and as they did, made their way to Salvador Dalí who led Europe’s surrealist painting movement. Instead of trying to capture reality like the Realists or interpret it like the Impressionists, the Surrealists went inwards and painted the landscape of their own consciousness. They rejected logic and reason in favor of dream-inspired visions.</p><p>第三是纯粹的猜测：自我困扰。也许我们的原创性疾病源于弗洛伊德的工作，这仍然是我们人类心理学模型的基础。在某种程度上，像自我和潜意识这样的想法似乎微不足道，这只是因为它们的影响力太大了。弗洛伊德的思想基本上被传播开来，并且像他们那样，传播到了领导欧洲超现实主义绘画运动的萨尔瓦多·达利那里。超现实主义者没有像现实主义者那样捕捉现实，也没有像印象主义者那样解读现实，而是深入内心，描绘自己意识的风景。他们拒绝了逻辑和理性，而支持以梦为灵感的愿景。</p><p> Then, the psychedelic movement of the 1960s may have entrenched us even deeper inside the internal world. As the twin movements of self-love and free expression grew, people rejected the authoritative declarations of Christianity and, in the terrifying wake of World War II, anything that smelled like orthodoxy. Instead of looking outward for answers, people turned inwards. This trend has only accelerated with the rise of therapy and meditation—fields in which many advocates insist that the self knows best and the answers are within us. We think of ourselves as tiny little islands. This is a uniquely contemporary mindset. As the pastor at a local church said to me recently, the early  Christians believed that our lives were porous. Rather than buffering themselves from exterior influences, they welcomed the divine in their lives and let it grow in them like a lush springtime flower.</p><p>那么，20世纪60年代的迷幻运动可能会让我们在内心世界中更加根深蒂固。随着自爱和自由表达这两大运动的发展，人们拒绝接受基督教的权威宣言，并在可怕的第二次世界大战后拒绝接受任何闻起来像正统的东西。人们没有向外寻找答案，而是向内看。这一趋势只是随着治疗和冥想领域的兴起而加速，在这些领域中，许多倡导者坚持认为自我最了解，答案就在我们内心。我们认为自己是一个小岛。这是一种独特的当代心态。正如当地教堂的牧师最近对我说的那样，早期的基督徒相信我们的生活是多孔的。他们并没有把自己从外部的影响中解放出来，而是在生活中欢迎神，让它像春天盛开的花朵一样在自己体内生长。</p><p> It is said that art reflects the  spirit of the times. Perhaps the thinking of our secular age has infiltrated our creative mindset too. In the world of art, our paintings are increasingly  abstract in order to reflect the subjective experience of the artists who made them. So often, they aim to capture attention with the originality of shock value instead of quality. This narcissistic self-worship has people rejecting the canon. As we’ve turned inwards for inspiration, we’ve turned originality into our cardinal virtue.</p><p>据说艺术反映了时代精神。也许我们世俗时代的思想也渗透到了我们的创造性思维中。在艺术世界中，我们的绘画越来越抽象，以反映艺术家的主观体验。通常，他们的目标是用震撼价值而不是质量的创意来吸引注意力。这种自恋的自我崇拜让人们拒绝接受正典。当我们向内心寻求灵感时，我们把独创性变成了我们的基本美德。</p><p> The alternative is a pursuit towards truth. In the words of C.S. Lewis, who is famous for the vivid imagination he presented in stories like the  Chronicles of Narnia: “No man who cares about originality will ever be original. It’s the man who’s only thinking about doing a good job or telling the truth who becomes really original—and doesn’t notice it.”</p><p>另一种选择是追求真理。C.S.刘易斯以其在《纳尼亚纪事》等小说中展现的生动想象力而闻名，他说：“任何一个关心独创性的人都不会是独创的。只有那些只想着做好工作或说实话的人，才会变得真正独创，却没有注意到这一点。”</p><p> Lewis’ words align with the premise of Roger Scruton’s excellent documentary   Why Beauty Matters . 2  He opens it with the premise that before the 20th century, if you asked anybody about the purpose of creating art, they would have said: “To make something beautiful.” But beginning around the time of Duchamp’s urinal in 1917, the primary purpose of art shifted to shocking its viewer with originality instead of beauty. To capture their viewers’ attention, artists disturbed their viewers and violated taboos. Rather than pursuing the lofty goal of objective beauty, we’ve turned inward and the results have been terribly ugly. Scruton insists that our language, music, and manners have become increasingly offensive and self-centered too. He blames the decline in beauty on the self-centeredness of modernity and a nonsensical break from tradition.</p><p>刘易斯的话符合罗杰·斯克鲁顿的优秀纪录片《为什么美丽重要》的前提。2.他在开篇的前提是，在20世纪之前，如果你问任何人创作艺术的目的，他们都会说：“创造美好的事物。”但从1917年杜尚的小便器时代开始，艺术的主要目的转向用创意而不是美来震撼观众。为了吸引观众的注意力，艺术家们扰乱了观众，违反了禁忌。我们没有追求客观美的崇高目标，而是转向内心，结果非常丑陋。Scruton坚持认为，我们的语言、音乐和礼仪也变得越来越无礼，越来越以自我为中心。他将美的衰落归咎于现代性的自我中心和对传统的荒谬突破。</p><p> 2 BBC took it down because it didn’t stand with their values, so the only available version is pirated and has Portuguese subtitles. Of course, this is how you know it’s a great documentary.</p><p>英国广播公司把它撤了下来，因为它不符合他们的价值观，所以唯一可用的版本是盗版的，有葡萄牙语字幕。当然，这就是为什么你知道这是一部很棒的纪录片。</p><p>  Don’t think I’m advocating for stasis though. I like watching humanity innovate, and valuing tradition too much can limit progress. Here, the artists of ancient Egypt come to mind. They trained to write in a rigid script, so their apprenticeships were only complete once they could cut images and symbols clearly in stone, according to the established rules. As Ernst Gombrich wrote in  The Story of Art: “No one wanted anything different, no one asked him to be ‘original’. On the contrary, he was probably considered the best artist who could make his statues most like the admired monuments of the past.” Driven by a philosophy of imitation without innovation, Egyptian art didn’t change much. A thousand years later, new works that closely resembled the ancestral ones were praised equally. There was little change, little progress, and little development. It was stagnant — imitation without innovation.</p><p>但别以为我是在提倡停滞期。我喜欢观看人类的创新，过于重视传统会限制进步。在这里，人们想起了古埃及的艺术家。他们接受过刻板的书写训练，因此，他们的学徒生涯只有在能够按照既定规则在石头上清晰地切割图像和符号后才能结束。正如恩斯特·贡布里奇（Ernst Gombrich）在《艺术的故事》（Story of Art）中所写：“没有人想要任何不同的东西，没有人要求他‘独创’。相反，他可能被认为是最优秀的艺术家，可以让他的雕像最像过去受人敬仰的纪念碑。”在没有创新的模仿哲学的推动下，埃及艺术没有发生多大变化。一千年后，与祖传作品极为相似的新作品受到了同等的赞扬。几乎没有变化，几乎没有进步，几乎没有发展。它停滞不前——没有创新的模仿。</p><p> Doing the opposite of the Egyptians doesn’t work either. Innovation without imitation is a fool’s strategy. Just look at the historical examples. Einstein’s paradigm-shifting invention of general relativity was enabled by decades of studying classical physicists, whose ideas he later built upon. Many of the most original musicians have spent hours practicing scales in order to pick up on the creative powers of those they admire. In the world of writing, Hunter S. Thompson once hand-wrote every word of  The Great Gatsby so he could feel what it’s like to write a great novel. Robert Louis Stevenson meticulously copied paragraphs he enjoyed, and once he got familiar with them, he threw the books to the other side of the room to force himself to rewrite paragraphs from memory.</p><p>做与埃及人相反的事也不管用。没有模仿的创新是傻瓜的策略。看看历史上的例子。爱因斯坦改变范式的广义相对论发明是由几十年来研究经典物理学家的努力促成的，他后来把这些物理学家的想法建立在这些物理学家的基础之上。许多最具独创性的音乐家花了数小时练习音阶，以汲取他们欣赏的人的创造力。在写作领域，亨特·S·汤普森曾经亲手写下《了不起的盖茨比》的每一个字，这样他就能感受到写一部伟大小说的感觉。罗伯特·路易斯·史蒂文森一丝不苟地抄写他喜欢的段落，一旦熟悉了，他就把书扔到房间的另一边，强迫自己根据记忆重写段落。</p><p> These days, writers are hesitant to promote these imitative strategies. Perhaps their aversion comes from how gung-ho schools are about the dreaded P-Word: plagiarism. The fear of plagiarism is injected into us in school, where we’re taught to fear anything that smells like imitation. Plagiarism was so heavily punished that I imagined it like the electric chainsaw that promised instant expulsion.</p><p>如今，作家们对推广这些模仿策略犹豫不决。也许他们的厌恶来自于学校对“剽窃”这个可怕的词的狂热。在学校里，对剽窃的恐惧被灌输给我们，我们被教导要害怕任何闻起来像模仿的东西。剽窃受到了如此严厉的惩罚，以至于我想象它就像电锯一样承诺立即被开除。</p><p> Of course, plagiarism is wrong. The problem is that our tormented fear of plagiarism has clenched its claws around the things that are actually good for you. Out of excessive trepidation, we’ve lost touch with the subtle, but important distinction between stealing other people’s work without giving them credit (which is obviously a bad thing) and mirroring the style or values of a writer you admire (which should be praised and promoted).</p><p>当然，剽窃是错误的。问题是，我们对剽窃的极度恐惧已经紧紧抓住了那些真正对你有益的东西。出于过度的恐惧，我们已经失去了一个微妙但重要的区别，即窃取他人的作品而不给予赞扬（这显然是一件坏事）和反映你欣赏的作家的风格或价值观（这应该得到赞扬和提升）。</p><p>   The etymology of the word “imitate” is one of my favorites. During the time of Shakespeare, the word “ape” meant both “primate” and “imitate.” Perhaps the etymology indicates that knowledge of imitation is core to who we are. 3</p><p>“模仿”这个词的词源是我最喜欢的词源之一。在莎士比亚时代，“猿”一词的意思是“灵长类”和“模仿”也许词源表明，模仿知识是我们的核心。3.</p><p> 3 That’s one reason why Christianity, the world’s largest religion, tells us to imitate another human being: Jesus Christ.</p><p>这就是世界上最大的宗教基督教告诉我们模仿另一个人的原因之一：耶稣基督。</p><p> Throughout human history, most imitative  learning happened through apprenticeships. Leonardo da Vinci comes to mind. He had almost no formal schooling, but secured his first apprenticeship at the age of 14. Time in his master’s studio led him to study math, anatomy, drawing techniques, and the beauty of geometry. In true “Imitate, then Innovate” fashion, there were obvious similarities between what da Vinci observed as an apprentice and what he’d later produce on his own. In fact, one of his master’s most famous sculptures was of the young warrior David standing in triumph over Goliath. (In fact, some scholars think their master-apprentice relationship was so close that da Vinci posed for Verrocchio’s  David). Given that, we shouldn’t be surprised that it resembled the one da Vinci painted later in his career and likely contributed to his fascination with Michelangelo’s statue of  David.</p><p>纵观人类历史，大多数模仿学习都是通过学徒制进行的。我想起了莱昂纳多·达芬奇。他几乎没有接受过正规教育，但在14岁时获得了第一次学徒资格。在硕士工作室的时间让他学习数学、解剖学、绘画技巧和几何之美。在真正的“模仿，然后创新”时尚中，达芬奇作为学徒观察到的东西和他后来自己创作的东西之间有着明显的相似之处。事实上，他主人最著名的雕塑之一是年轻的战士大卫战胜歌利亚的胜利。（事实上，一些学者认为他们的师徒关系如此密切，以至于达芬奇为维罗基奥的《大卫》摆姿势。）。有鉴于此，我们不应该感到惊讶，因为它与达芬奇在其职业生涯后期绘制的那幅画相似，可能是他对米开朗基罗的大卫雕像着迷的原因。</p><p>  Today, things have changed. We’ve dropped apprenticeships in the name of  efficiency. Instead of doing an apprenticeship, wannabe Da Vincis are training at professional art schools. With the decline of apprenticeships came the decline of imitative learning. The twin rise of the printing press and, later, mass schooling, led us to disproportionately value knowledge that could be codified in textbooks. Humanity dropped apprenticeships in pursuit of efficiency. What humanity gained in its ability to scale the transmission of facts it lost in its disproportionate focus on ideas that could travel in textbooks. The transmission of technique and tacit knowledge was lost in translation.</p><p>今天，情况发生了变化。我们以提高效率的名义放弃了学徒制。想要成为达芬奇的人不是学徒，而是在专业艺术学校接受培训。随着学徒制的衰落，模仿学习也随之衰落。印刷术和后来的大众教育的双重崛起，使我们对可以编入教科书的知识产生了不成比例的重视。人类为了追求效率而放弃了学徒制。人类在衡量事实传播的能力方面所获得的东西，在过度关注可能在教科书中传播的思想时失去了。技术和隐性知识的传递在翻译中丢失了。</p><p> To see what I mean, look at writing education. English class teaches you how to be a good editor because it’s the easiest thing to systematize and communicate in textbooks. That’s why we learn grammar and syntax. Though they’re useful, they don’t have much to say about the deeper but indescribable aspects of writing: idea generation, how to recognize the shape of an interesting argument, honing your style, overcoming the fear of criticism, and fighting  writer’s block. Common pieces of advice like “get rid of the passive voice” are shallow, low-leverage points of instruction compared to the real, but hard-to-describe benefits of creating your own vocabulary or becoming a more observant person — both of which are better learned through imitation.</p><p>要明白我的意思，看看写作教育。英语课教你如何成为一名好的编辑，因为这是在教科书中最容易系统化和交流的事情。这就是我们学习语法和句法的原因。虽然它们很有用，但对于写作的深层次但无法描述的方面，它们没有太多的话要说：创意的产生，如何识别有趣论点的形状，磨练你的风格，克服对批评的恐惧，以及与作家的阻碍作斗争。像“摆脱被动语态”这样的常见建议与实际情况相比是肤浅的、低杠杆的教学点，但很难描述创造自己的词汇或成为一个更善于观察的人的好处——这两者都可以通过模仿更好地学习。</p><p>  The harder it is to put the core knowledge into words, the more a skill should be developed through imitative learning. Often, these skills have a bunch of subtleties that are best learned in conversation with a master, or by watching them do their work. Cooking is the ultimate example. Though I’ve bought a few cookbooks from my favorite steakhouses, the charr on the outside of my Ribeyes are never quite as perfect and the meat is never quite as juicy. Following a recipe can make you a great dinner host, but it won’t turn you into Gordon Ramsay. Though every chef should know the basic science of food preparation — such as the four elements of good cooking (salt, fat, acid, heat) and the five taste buds (sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami) — the highest levels of cooking are driven by supple rules of thumb that are best acquired through the apprenticeship model that every high-end chef goes through. Knowing the science of cooking can take chefs to the top 10% of their craft, but knowing the art takes them to the top 1%. This is because rigid frameworks are too strict for the contoured nature of reality in the kitchen.</p><p>核心知识越难用语言表达，就越需要通过模仿学习来培养技能。通常情况下，这些技能都有一些微妙之处，最好是通过与大师对话，或通过观看他们完成工作来学习。烹饪就是最好的例子。虽然我从我最喜欢的牛排馆买了几本烹饪书，但我的里贝耶牛排外面的烤肉从来没有那么完美，肉也从来没有那么多汁。遵循食谱可以让你成为一名出色的晚餐主人，但它不会让你变成戈登·拉姆齐。尽管每位厨师都应该了解食物准备的基础科学——比如好的烹饪的四个要素（盐、脂肪、酸、热）和五种味蕾（甜、酸、咸、苦和鲜味）——但烹饪的最高水平是由灵活的经验法则驱动的，这些经验法则最好是通过每一个高端厨师都需要的学徒模式获得的厨师通过了。了解烹饪的科学知识可以让厨师达到他们手艺的前10%，但了解烹饪的艺术知识可以让他们达到前1%。这是因为僵硬的框架对于厨房中现实的轮廓性质来说过于严格。</p><p> Creative work is similar. The difference though is that you can imitate the end product of creative work in a way you can’t do with cooking. This is why reading a lot of good writing is among the best ways to become a good writer. Even if the principles of effective writing are hard to communicate, reading a lot hones your intuition for what quality writing feels like.</p><p>创意工作也是如此。不过，不同之处在于，你可以模仿创造性工作的最终成果，而这是烹饪所无法做到的。这就是为什么阅读大量优秀作品是成为优秀作家的最佳途径之一。即使有效写作的原则很难沟通，大量阅读也会磨练你的直觉，让你了解高质量写作的感觉。</p><p> For knowing when to embrace imitative learning, I’ll throw one more principle into the pot: the more you’re drawn to learning the skill on YouTube, the more it’ll benefit from imitative learning. “YouTube skills” tend to be more bodily than intellectual. They’re hard to describe in words. Nobody learns to dance by reading a textbook. Instead they watch videos they can copy, emulate the people they see moving on their screen, and if they’re serious, work with a coach who can provide instant feedback. Likewise, people often say that books about writing are categorically bad — and they’re right. It’s not because the writers are bad, but because when you try to distill the deepest parts of writing into text, the ideas become so reductive that they stop being useful.</p><p>为了知道什么时候应该接受模仿学习，我将向大家介绍另外一个原则：你越是被吸引到YouTube上学习这项技能，它就越能从模仿学习中受益。“YouTube技能”往往是身体技能而非智力技能。它们很难用语言描述。没有人通过阅读课本来学习舞蹈。相反，他们观看可以复制的视频，模仿他们在屏幕上看到的移动的人，如果他们是认真的，与能够提供即时反馈的教练合作。同样，人们经常说关于写作的书绝对是糟糕的——他们是对的。这并不是因为作者不好，而是因为当你试图将写作的最深层部分提炼成文本时，这些想法变得如此简单，以至于它们不再有用。</p><p> Improving creative  education begins with retrieving the benefits of apprenticeships. When you imitate somebody’s work, you’re forced to think about why they made the decisions they made. Through consumption and creation, you weave the threads of other people’s work into a tapestry of your own.</p><p>改善创新教育首先要恢复学徒制的好处。当你模仿别人的作品时，你不得不思考他们为什么做出决定。通过消费和创造，你把别人的作品编织成自己的织锦。</p><p>   They say that social situations will reveal who you are because personality is relative and you don’t have anybody to compare yourself to when you’re alone. I like how the poet John O’Donohue put it when he wrote: “In the presence of the other, you begin to see who you are in how they reflect you back to yourself.”</p><p>他们说，社交场合会揭示你是谁，因为个性是相对的，当你独自一人时，你没有任何人可以与你相比。我喜欢诗人约翰·奥多诺霍（John O’Donohue）在他写道：“在他人面前，你开始看到自己是谁，他们如何将你反射回自己。”</p><p> Imitation helps us discover our creative personalities because it reveals our taste and which parts of the creative process come most naturally to us. This is what writers mean when they say they’re trying to find their “voice.”</p><p>模仿有助于我们发现自己的创造性个性，因为它揭示了我们的品味，以及创作过程中最自然的部分。这就是作家们说他们试图找到自己的“声音”的意思</p><p> Through imitation, you can create your own apprenticeship. I know a painting coach who tells her students to listen for resistance in the imitation process. She says that your authentic artistic voice shines in the delta between your own style and the style of the painter you want to emulate.</p><p>通过模仿，你可以创造自己的学徒生涯。我认识一位绘画教练，她告诉她的学生在模仿过程中倾听阻力。她说，你真实的艺术声音在你自己的风格和你想模仿的画家的风格之间的三角洲闪耀。</p><p> One of my favorite parts of visiting art museums is watching up-and-coming artists sketch in the gallery rooms. I always try to talk to a few of them because the act of imitation makes them think so deeply about the art before their eyes. Through conversation, I can pick up their observations and integrate it into my memory bank of knowledge. During a trip to the British Museum, I once met an aspiring painter named Finley. He was sketching some ancient Greek statues, and aimed to magnify the sense of movement in them. With each black line and each smudge of shadow, he was forced to consider why the sculptor shaped the marble in the way he did. Though these statues were centuries old, Finley was engaged in a spirited conversation with the ghost of this bygone craftsman.</p><p>参观艺术博物馆时，我最喜欢的一件事就是在美术馆的房间里观看崭露头角的艺术家们的素描。我总是试着和他们中的一些人交谈，因为模仿的行为让他们对眼前的艺术思考得如此深刻。通过对话，我可以收集他们的观察结果，并将其整合到我的知识记忆库中。在大英博物馆的一次旅行中，我遇到了一位有抱负的画家，名叫芬利。他正在画一些古希腊雕像的草图，旨在放大其中的运动感。每个黑线和阴影的每个污点，他被迫考虑为什么雕塑家的大理石形状，他做的方式。尽管这些雕像已有数百年的历史，芬利却与这位逝去工匠的鬼魂进行了一次意气风发的对话。</p><p>  It’s no coincidence that many professional writers are trained in painting. Learning to see as a painter is among the best things you can do to become a more articulate writer. Both skills require a keen sense of observation. Where painters aim to illuminate the world with color and shadow, writers aim to illuminate it with words and metaphors. Both activities are acts of composition and sometimes, the selective withholding of information. Writing and painting have similar essential properties that manifest themselves in wildly different ways — like different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Likewise, visible light, X-rays, ultraviolet, and infrared light waves are simply different ways of capturing the same reality.</p><p>许多专业作家都受过绘画训练，这并非巧合。学会以画家的身份看待问题是你成为一个更善于表达的作家所能做的最好的事情之一。这两种技能都需要敏锐的观察力。画家的目标是用色彩和阴影来照亮世界，而作家的目标是用文字和隐喻来照亮世界。这两种行为都是合成行为，有时是选择性地隐瞒信息。书写和绘画有着相似的本质属性，它们以截然不同的方式表现出来——比如电磁频谱的不同部分。同样，可见光、X射线、紫外线和红外光只是捕捉同一现实的不同方式。</p><p> The most surprising part of sketching is seeing all the little details in a scene that only occur to you after you’ve been observing it for a few hours. To write and to paint is to learn how to see. Maybe that’s why David McCullough, a trained painter and arguably America’s greatest biographer once said: “Insight comes, more often than not, from looking at what’s been on the table all along, in front of everybody, rather than discovering something new… That’s Dickens’ great admonition to all writers, ‘Make me see.’”</p><p>素描最令人惊讶的部分是看到场景中的所有小细节，这些细节只有在你观察了几个小时后才会出现。写作和绘画就是学习如何看。也许这就是为什么训练有素的画家、可以说是美国最伟大的传记作家戴维·麦卡洛（David McCullough）曾说：“洞察力往往来自于在所有人面前看到一直摆在桌面上的东西，而不是发现新的东西……这是狄更斯对所有作家的伟大忠告，‘让我明白’。”</p><p> If painters get so much out of imi</p><p>如果画家能从imi身上得到这么多</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/模仿/">#模仿</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/imitate/">#imitate</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
