She is seeking class-action status for some of the claims, though courts have yet to certify the class.</p><p>Liss Riordan女士代表数百名前IBM员工提出类似索赔。她正在为一些索赔寻求集体诉讼地位，尽管法院尚未对此类索赔进行认证。</p><p> Adam Pratt, an IBM spokesman, defended the company’s employment practices. “IBM never engaged in systemic age discrimination,” he said. “Employees were separated because of shifts in business conditions and demand for certain skills, not because of their age.”</p><p>IBM发言人亚当·普拉特为公司的雇佣行为辩护。“IBM从未参与过系统性的年龄歧视，”他说。“员工离职是因为商业环境的变化和对某些技能的需求，而不是因为他们的年龄。”</p><p> Mr. Pratt said that IBM hired more than 10,000 people over 50 in the United States from 2010 to 2020, and that the median age of IBM’s U.S. work force was the same in each of those years: 48. The company would not disclose how many U.S. workers it had during that period.</p><p>普拉特说，从2010年到2020年，IBM在美国雇佣了超过1万名50岁以上的员工，而且IBM美国劳动力的年龄中位数在每一年都是相同的：48岁。该公司不愿透露在此期间有多少美国工人。</p><p> A  2018 article by the nonprofit investigative website ProPublica documented the company’s apparent strategy of replacing older workers with younger ones and argued that it followed from the determination of Ginni Rometty, then IBM’s chief executive, to seize market share in such cutting-edge fields as cloud services, big data analytics, mobile, security and social media. According to the ProPublica article, based in part on internal planning documents, IBM believed that it needed a larger proportion of younger workers to gain traction in these areas.</p><p>非营利调查网站ProPublica在2018年发表的一篇文章中记录了该公司用年轻员工取代年长员工的明显战略，并指出，这源于时任IBM首席执行官吉尼·罗梅蒂（Ginni Rometty）在云服务、大数据分析、，移动、安全和社交媒体。根据部分基于内部规划文件的ProPublica文章，IBM认为需要更大比例的年轻员工才能在这些领域获得吸引力。</p><p>  In 2020, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission released a summary of an investigation into these practices at IBM, which found that there was “top-down messaging from IBM’s highest ranks directing managers to engage in an aggressive approach to significantly reduce the head count of older workers.” But the agency did not publicly release evidence supporting its claims.</p><p>2020年，平等就业机会委员会（Equal Employment Opportunity Commission）发布了一份IBM对这些做法的调查摘要，发现“IBM高层发出了自上而下的信息，指示管理者采取积极的方法，大幅减少老年员工的人数。”但该机构没有公开发布支持其主张的证据。</p><p>  The newly unsealed documents — which quote from internal company emails, and which were filed in a “statement of material facts” in the lawsuit brought by Ms. Liss-Riordan — appear to affirm those conclusions and show top IBM executives specifically emphasizing the need to thin the ranks of older workers and hire more younger ones.</p><p>这些新启封的文件引用了公司内部的电子邮件，并在Liss Riordan提起的诉讼中以“重要事实陈述”的形式提交。这些文件似乎证实了这些结论，并显示IBM高层管理人员特别强调了精简年长员工队伍和雇佣更年轻员工的必要性。</p><p> “We discussed the fact that our millennial population trails competitors,” says one email from a top executive at the time. “The data below is very sensitive — not to be shared — but wanted to make sure you have it. You will see that while Accenture is 72% millennial we are at 42% with a wide range and many units falling well below that average. Speaks to the need to hire early professionals.”</p><p>“我们讨论了我们的千禧一代人口落后于竞争对手的事实，”当时一位高管的一封电子邮件说。“下面的数据非常敏感——不能共享——但希望确保你拥有这些数据。你会看到，埃森哲有72%是千禧一代，而我们有42%是千禧一代，范围很广，许多单位远远低于这一平均水平。这说明需要雇佣早期专业人士。”</p><p> “Early professionals” was the company’s term for a role that required little prior experience.</p><p>“早期专业人士”是该公司对一个几乎不需要经验的职位的称呼。</p><p> Another email by a top executive, appearing to refer to older workers, mentions a plan to “accelerate change by inviting the ‘dinobabies’ (new species) to leave” and make them an “extinct species.”</p><p>一位高管的另一封电子邮件似乎是针对年长员工的，其中提到了一项计划，即“通过邀请‘恐龙’（新物种）离开来加速变化”，并使它们成为“灭绝物种”</p><p> A third email refers to IBM’s “dated maternal workforce,” an apparent allusion to older women, and says: “This is what must change. They really don’t understand social or engagement. Not digital natives. A real threat for us.”</p><p>第三封邮件提到了IBM的“过时的母亲劳动力”，这显然是对年长女性的暗示，并说：“这是必须改变的。她们真的不了解社交或参与。不是数字原住民。这对我们来说是一个真正的威胁。”</p><p> Mr. Pratt, the spokesman, said that some of the language in the emails “is not consistent with the respect IBM has for its employees” and “does not reflect company practices or policies.” The statement of material facts redacts the names of the emails’ authors but indicates that they left the company in 2020.</p><p>发言人普拉特说，电子邮件中的一些措辞“与IBM对其员工的尊重不一致”，并且“没有反映公司的做法或政策”这份重要事实声明对电子邮件作者的姓名进行了修订，但表明他们是在2020年离开公司的。</p><p>  Both earlier legal filings and the newly unsealed documents contend that IBM sought to hire about 25,000 workers who typically had little experience during the 2010s.  At the same time, “a comparable number of older, non-Millennial workers needed to be let go,” concluded a passage in one of the newly unsealed documents, a ruling in a private arbitration initiated by a former IBM employee.</p><p>早期的法律文件和新公布的文件都声称，IBM试图雇佣约25000名工人，这些人在2010年代通常没有什么经验。与此同时，“相当数量的老年非千禧一代员工需要被解雇，”一份新启封的文件中的一段话总结道，这是一项由IBM前员工发起的私人仲裁裁决。</p><p>  Similarly, the E.E.O.C.’s letter summarizing its investigation of IBM found that older workers made up over 85 percent of the group whom the company viewed as candidates for layoffs, though the agency did not specify what it considered “older.”</p><p>类似地，欧盟经合组织在总结其对IBM调查的信中发现，在该公司视为裁员候选人的群体中，年龄较大的员工占85%以上，但该机构没有具体说明其认为“年龄较大”的群体</p><p> The newly unsealed documents suggest that IBM sought to carry out its strategy in a variety of ways, including a policy that no “early professional hire” can be included in a mass layoff in the employee’s first 12 months at the company. “We are not making the progress we need to make demographically, and we are squandering our investment in talent acquisition and training,” an internal email states.</p><p>最新公布的文件表明，IBM试图以多种方式实施其战略，其中包括一项政策，即员工在公司的头12个月内大规模裁员不得包括“早期专业雇佣”。一封内部电子邮件写道：“我们没有在人口统计方面取得所需的进展，我们正在浪费我们在人才获取和培训方面的投资。”。</p><p>  The lawsuit also argues that IBM sought to eliminate older workers by requiring them to move to a different part of the country to keep their jobs, assuming that most would decline to move. One internal email stated that the “typical relo accept rate is 8-10%,” while another said that the company would need to find work for those who accepted, suggesting that there was not a business rationale for asking employees to relocate.</p><p>这起诉讼还辩称，IBM试图通过要求老年工人迁往美国其他地区以保住工作来消除老年工人，前提是大多数人会拒绝搬家。一封内部邮件称“典型的重新安置接受率为8-10%”，而另一封邮件则表示，公司需要为那些接受重新安置的人找到工作，这表明要求员工重新安置没有商业理由。</p><p> And while IBM employees designated for layoffs were officially allowed to apply for open jobs within the company, other evidence included in the new disclosure suggests that the company discouraged managers from actually hiring them. For example, according to the statement of material facts, managers had to request approval from corporate headquarters if they wanted to move ahead with a hire.</p><p>虽然被指定裁员的IBM员工被正式允许申请公司内部的空缺职位，但新披露的其他证据表明，公司不鼓励经理们实际聘用他们。例如，根据重要事实陈述，如果经理们想继续招聘，他们必须向公司总部申请批准。</p><p> Several of the plaintiffs in a separate lawsuit brought by Ms. Liss-Riordan appeared to have been on the receiving end of these practices. One of them, Edvin Rusis, joined IBM in 2003 and had worked as a “solution manager.” He was informed by the company in March 2018 that he would be laid off within a few months. According to his legal complaint, Mr. Rusis applied for five internal positions after learning of his forthcoming layoff but heard nothing in response to any of his applications.</p><p>在Liss Riordan女士提起的另一起诉讼中，几名原告似乎是这些做法的接受方。其中一人Edvin Rusis于2003年加入IBM，曾担任“解决方案经理”2018年3月，该公司通知他，他将在几个月内被解雇。根据他的法律申诉，鲁西斯在得知自己即将被解雇后申请了五个内部职位，但对他的任何申请都没有得到任何回应。</p><p> Mr. Pratt, the spokesman, said that the company’s efforts to shield recent hires from layoffs, as well as its approach to relocating workers, were blind to age, and that many workers designated for layoffs did secure new jobs with IBM.</p><p>发言人普拉特说，该公司为保护最近雇佣的员工不被解雇所做的努力，以及重新安置员工的方法，都是对年龄的忽视，许多被指定裁员的员工确实在IBM找到了新工作。</p><p>  The ProPublica story from 2018 identified employees in similar situations, and others who were asked to relocate out of state and decided to leave the company instead.</p><p>2018年的ProPublica故事指出了处于类似情况的员工，以及其他被要求迁出州并决定离开公司的人。</p><p> The company has faced other age discrimination claims, including a lawsuit filed in federal court in which plaintiffs accused the company of laying off large numbers of baby boomers because they were “less innovative and generally out of touch with IBM’s brand, customers and objectives.” The case was settled in 2017, according to ProPublica.</p><p>该公司还面临其他年龄歧视指控，包括向联邦法院提起的诉讼，原告指控该公司解雇了大量婴儿潮一代，因为他们“缺乏创新，通常与IBM的品牌、客户和目标脱节”据ProPublica称，此案于2017年结案。</p><p> In 2004, the company  agreed to pay more than $300 million to settle with employees who argued that its decision in the 1990s to replace its traditional pension plan with a plan that included some features of a 401(k) constituted age discrimination.</p><p>2004年，该公司同意支付3亿多美元，与员工达成和解。员工辩称，该公司在20世纪90年代决定用包含401（k）计划某些特征的计划取代传统养老金计划，构成了年龄歧视。</p><p> The federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act prohibits discrimination against people 40 or over in hiring and employment on the basis of their age, with limited exceptions.</p><p>《联邦就业年龄歧视法》禁止40岁或40岁以上的人因年龄而在雇佣和就业方面受到歧视，但有少数例外。</p><p> The act also requires companies to disclose the age and positions of all people within a group or department being laid off, as well as those being kept on, before a worker waives the right to sue for age discrimination. Companies typically require such waivers before granting workers’ severance packages.</p><p>该法案还要求公司在员工放弃年龄歧视起诉权之前，披露集团或部门内所有被解雇人员以及被留任人员的年龄和职位。公司通常在发放员工遣散费之前要求此类豁免。</p><p> But IBM stopped asking workers who received severance packages to waive their right to sue beginning in 2014, which allowed it to cease providing information about the age and positions of workers affected by a mass layoff.</p><p>但从2014年开始，IBM不再要求收到遣散费的员工放弃起诉权，这使得它可以停止提供受大规模裁员影响的员工的年龄和职位信息。</p><p> Instead, IBM required workers receiving a severance package to bring any discrimination claims individually in arbitration — a private justice system  often preferred by corporations and other powerful defendants. Mr. Pratt said the change was made to better protect workers’ privacy.</p><p>相反，IBM要求领取遣散费的员工在仲裁中单独提出任何歧视索赔——这是一个私人司法系统，企业和其他有权势的被告往往更喜欢这种系统。普拉特说，做出这一改变是为了更好地保护员工的隐私。</p><p>  While some former employees preserved their ability to sue IBM in court by declining the severance package, many former employees accepted the package, requiring them to bring claims in arbitration. Ms. Liss-Riordan, who is running for attorney general of Massachusetts, represents employees in both situations.</p><p>虽然一些前雇员拒绝了遣散费，保留了他们在法庭上起诉IBM的能力，但许多前雇员接受了遣散费，要求他们在仲裁中提出索赔。正在竞选马萨诸塞州总检察长的利斯·里奥尔丹在这两种情况下都代表员工。</p><p> The particular legal matter that prompted the release of the documents in federal court was a motion by one of the plaintiffs whose late husband had signed an agreement requiring arbitration, and whose arbitration proceeding IBM then sought to block.</p><p>促使联邦法院公布这些文件的具体法律问题是一名原告提出的动议，其已故丈夫签署了一项要求仲裁的协议，IBM随后试图阻止其仲裁程序。</p><p> IBM argued that the plaintiff sought to pursue the claim in arbitration after the window for doing so had passed, and that some of the evidence the plaintiff sought to introduce was confidential under the arbitration agreement. The plaintiff argued that those provisions of the arbitration agreement were unenforceable.</p><p>IBM辩称，原告寻求在仲裁窗口过去后提起诉讼，并且原告试图提出的一些证据根据仲裁协议是保密的。原告辩称，仲裁协议的这些条款不可执行。</p><p> The judge in the case, Lewis J. Liman, has yet to rule on the merits of that argument. But in January, Judge Liman ruled that documents in the case, including the statement of material facts, should be available to the public.</p><p>本案法官刘易斯·J·利曼尚未对该论点的是非曲直做出裁决。但今年1月，利曼法官裁定，案件中的文件，包括重要事实陈述，应向公众公开。</p><p> IBM asked a federal appellate court to stay Judge Liman’s disclosure decision, but a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected the company’s argument, and the full circuit court also declined to grant a stay. The New York Times filed an amicus brief to the circuit court arguing that the First Amendment applied to the documents in question.</p><p>IBM要求联邦上诉法院暂缓利曼法官的披露决定，但美国第二巡回上诉法院的一个由三名法官组成的小组驳回了该公司的论点，巡回法院也拒绝批准暂缓。《纽约时报》向巡回法院提交了一份法庭之友简报，辩称第一修正案适用于相关文件。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/灭绝/">#灭绝</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/员工/">#员工</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
