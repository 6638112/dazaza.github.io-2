I pass it often in the car. The wolf, it says, was killed by the hunter Polson in or about the year 1700.</p><p>Brora附近有一座纪念碑，距离John o’Groats不到60英里，声称纪念萨瑟兰最后一头狼被杀的地点。我经常在车上通过。它说，这头狼是在1700年左右被猎人Polson杀死的。</p><p> I know this story. Polson, so it goes, was standing watch outside the wolf’s lair while his sons laid waste to the pups inside. When the she-wolf returned from the hunt, racing to the aid of her young, she bounded past the hunter and, as she did, he grabbed her by the tail. From inside the den – now plunged into darkness as Polson and the wolf struggled at its entrance – came, in Gaelic, a shout of alarm: “Father! What’s blocking the light?” To which Polson replied: “If the tail comes away at the root, you’ll soon find out!”</p><p> 我知道这个故事。顺便说一句，波尔森正站在狼的巢穴外面守望，而他的儿子们则将废物浪费在了狼窝里。当她的狼从狩猎中回来时，在年轻的帮助下赛车，她越过了猎人，并且像她一样，他抓住了她的尾巴。鲍尔森和狼在入口处挣扎时，从书房内部陷入了黑暗。盖尔语中传来一声惊:：“父亲！是什么挡住了灯？”波尔森对此回答：“如果尾巴从根部脱落，您很快就会发现！”</p><p> It’s an unlikely story, even as such stories go. The history of wolves is saturated with this kind of machismo and mythmaking. Here are all its stock ingredients: the lupine villain, the plucky hunter, the lucky break. Did it really happen? Probably not. Still, whether Polson is to blame or not, there are no wild wolves left in  Scotland. By 1700, they had also long been extirpated from England and from Wales – though their old territory is commemorated in the form of names: Ulthwaite, Wolfenden, Wolfheles, Wolvenfield. Their deaths, too: Woolpit, Wolfpit, Woolfall. All across Europe there were centuries of open warfare against the wolf – that universal antihero, folkloric villain, sharp-toothed grandmother with a glint in her eye – which saw it hunted relentlessly wherever people lived, persecuted across continents and cultures.</p><p> 即使是这样的故事，这也是一个不太可能的故事。狼的历史充满了这种大男子主义和神话。这里是所有库存的成分：羽扇豆小人，勇敢的猎人，幸运的休息。真的发生了吗？可能不会。尽管如此，无论波尔森是否应受指责，苏格兰仍然没有野狼。到1700年，他们也早已从英格兰和威尔士灭绝，尽管他们的旧领土以名字的形式来纪念：Ulthwaite，Wolfenden，Wolfheles，Wolvenfield。他们也死了：Woolpit，Wolfpit，Woolfall。在整个欧洲，数百年来一直在与野狼展开野战-那个普遍的反英雄，民俗的恶棍，锋利的祖母，她的眼睛一闪而过-看到它在任何人居住的地方都被无情地猎杀，遍及各大洲和文化。</p><p>  In Europe, those that survived retreated to rare enclaves, finding sanctuary on the high ground of the Apennines, or fleeing east into the debatable lands where Europe bleeds into Asia: Carpathia, the Balkans. There, the wolves in exile clung on, waiting for an opportunity, preparing for their victorious return.</p><p>  在欧洲，幸存下来的人退居到稀有的飞地，在亚平宁山脉的高地上找到庇护所，或向东逃往欧洲流向亚洲的有争议的土地：喀尔巴阡山脉，巴尔干半岛。在那里，流亡的狼紧紧抓住，等待机会，为他们的胜利返回做准备。</p><p> If the trajectory of the European wolf is dispiriting, it is also familiar. We have become well acquainted with graphs that plot the advance of humans against the decline of all else. Everywhere we go, it seems, we wreak death and destruction,  chipping away at the natural world. But over the last century, a different narrative has been writing itself into existence. In Europe, patterns of farming and land use have been changing on a grand scale, as marginal land – too steep or too depleted to be worth the effort of farming – falls into disuse. As the value of livestock has dropped, young people, too, have increasingly abandoned rural areas for cities. When they do, ever more land often goes unclaimed, unploughed, unrestrained. Some estimate that in the three decades leading to 2030, an area the size of Italy will have been abandoned within the EU alone.</p><p> 如果欧洲狼的轨迹令人沮丧，那也是众所周知的。我们已经非常熟悉将人类的进步与其他一切的衰落相对应的图表。似乎我们走到的每个地方都在造成死亡和破坏，摧毁了自然世界。但是在过去的一个世纪中，一种不同的叙事一直在自我书写。在欧洲，由于边际土地（太陡或太贫乏，不值得进行耕作的努力）已被废弃，因此耕作和土地使用的方式正在发生大规模变化。随着牲畜价值的下降，年轻人也越来越多地将农村地区抛给城市。当他们这样做时，越来越多的土地往往无人认领，不受耕作，不受限制。有人估计，在到2030年的三十年中，仅在欧盟内部就将放弃意大利这样大的地区。</p><p> While our attention has been elsewhere, nature has been expanding into the gaps left behind. As annual crops fade away without human input, shrubs and fast-spreading thorns take their place. Then tiny trees take root and the ground starts to bristle with new life as soft and hard woods, hoisted from the earth, spread a densely embroidered tapestry of life across the landscape. The still summer’s air is soon vibrating with the tiny wings of insects. Songbirds raise their voices, trail up and down the scales, an orchestra coming into tune. Rabbits, badgers and foxes dig their homes between the roots. Deer graze in shabby pastures, leap tumbledown gates. Along the rivers’ edges, otters dive and beavers build their dams – some reintroduced, many recolonising territory of their own accord. Mice nest in old barns. Wild boar rootle in new woods.</p><p> 尽管我们的注意力转移到其他地方，但自然已经在扩大到留下的空白中。随着一年一度的农作物在没有人工干预的情况下逐渐消失，灌木和快速蔓延的荆棘取代了它们。然后，微小的树木生根发芽，大地开始生硬，刚硬的木材从地上升起，在地面上散布着浓密的绣花织锦，成为新生命。寂静的夏天的空气很快随着昆虫的微小翅膀振动。鸣鸟提高声音，在音阶上向上和向下移动，使乐团响起来。兔子，badge和狐狸在两根之间挖出自己的家。鹿在破旧的牧场上吃草，翻滚翻滚的大门。沿着河流的边缘，水獭潜水，海狸筑起水坝-一些是重新引入的，许多是自己定居的。老鼠在旧谷仓里筑巢。在新的树林里的野猪根。</p><p> All this Arcadian plenty has tempted in the carnivores, who crept in quietly at first, testing the waters. Lynx: low to the ground, ear-tufted, slinking through the shadows, rarely seen. Some 9,000 of them or more are  now thought to live on the continent, having been hunted to local extinction in western and central Europe by the middle of the 20th century. Brown bears: 17,000 of them,  spread through Scandinavia, the Dinaric Alps, the Carpathian mountains, Bulgaria, Greece, Cantabria, the Alps.</p><p> 所有这些阿卡迪亚人的食物都吸引了食肉动物，这些食肉动物起初悄悄地潜入水中，试水。山猫：低到地面，簇簇着耳朵，在阴影中徘徊，鲜为人知。据认为，到20世纪中叶，其中约有9,000或更多的人生活在非洲大陆上，已被捕到西欧和中欧的局部灭绝。棕熊：17,000只，分布在斯堪的纳维亚半岛，迪纳里克阿尔卑斯山，喀尔巴阡山脉，保加利亚，希腊，坎塔布里亚，阿尔卑斯山。</p><p>   There are an estimated 12,000 wolves  in Europe now, far more than in the contiguous US – where the grey wolf was similarly persecuted, until legal protections came into force in the 70s – and they have now been documented in every single country on the European mainland. In 2017, the first wolf for more than a century was spotted in Luxembourg and the first wolf was sighted in Denmark for 200 years. Last year, wolves were confirmed to have set up home in a Dutch national park. These are all crowded countries, intensively farmed and densely populated, and the wolves’ presence there indicates how closely our ranges have come to overlap. Recently, while the residents of Scanno, Italy, were confined inside to halt the spread of Covid-19, four wolves were seen to hunt a herd of deer through the town; they took down a hind and devoured it right there in the street.</p><p>目前，欧洲估计有12,000头狼，远比美国连续遭受威胁的美国多。在美国，狼一直受到类似的迫害，直到70年代法律保护生效为止，现在在欧洲大陆的每个国家都有记录在案。 。 2017年，在卢森堡发现了一个多世纪以来的第一只狼，在丹麦发现了200年以来的第一只狼。去年，狼被确认在荷兰国家公园安家。这些都是拥挤的国家，属于集约化养殖和人口稠密的国家，那里狼群的存在表明我们的分布范围有多近的重叠。最近，当意大利Scanno的居民被限制在室内以阻止Covid-19的传播时，发现有四头狼在镇上猎杀一群鹿。他们拿下了后脚，在街上吞噬了它。</p><p> Mainly, however, the wolves live where we have ceded ground. Iberian wolves now wander the ghost villages of Galicia, and Eurasian wolves haunt abandoned cold war-era  military sites along the former iron curtain. In the early 00s, they crossed the border into Germany from the dense forests of Poland, finding sanctuary in former army testing ranges and post-industrial ruins. There are now more than 100 German wolf packs, each of five to 10 animals, occasionally more. Where we have withdrawn, they have grown. Our loss has been their gain.</p><p> 但是，主要来说，狼生活在我们割让的地方。伊比利亚狼现在在加利西亚的幽灵村庄中徘徊，而欧亚狼则在前铁幕沿线的冷战时期军事遗迹中徘徊。 00年代初，他们从波兰茂密的森林越境进入德国，在前陆军测试场和后工业废墟中找到庇护所。现在有100多个德国狼群，每群5到10只动物，有时更多。我们撤退的地方，他们已经成长。我们的损失就是他们的收获。</p><p> But then again, maybe that’s the wrong way to think about it. Perhaps their gain could be our gain, too; perhaps their return heralds change for the better, for the whole ecosystem. In recent years, scientists have come to appreciate the full impact that an apex predator, such as the wolf, can have upon its wider environment. The seminal case study that guides thinking on this issue is that of Yellowstone national park, 3,500 square miles of protected land in north-west Wyoming. There, the 1995 reintroduction of grey wolves into the environment after a 70-year absence has  offered insight into the influence of large predators upon the behaviour of grazing animals, their prey.</p><p> 但是话又说回来，也许这是错误的思考方式。他们的收获也许也可以是我们的收获；也许他们的回归使者为整个生态系统变得更好。近年来，科学家开始意识到诸如狼之类的先头掠食者对其广泛环境可能产生的全部影响。指导这一问题的开创性案例研究是怀俄明州西北部3,500平方英里保护地的黄石国家公园。在那儿，灰狼缺席了70年之后，1995年重新将灰狼引入环境，这使人们能够洞察大型捕食者对放牧动物及其猎物行为的影响。</p><p>  As far as the elk and mule deer of Yellowstone were concerned, the return of the wolves changed everything. Though they had faced some predation throughout – not least from humans with guns – they had grown used to milling freely through the open landscape, grazing hither and thither. Heretofore relatively peaceful sunlit glades and fragrant sagebrush meadows became gauntlets to run, through which they moved as targets. They grew nervy, hesitant. They kept on the move through the clearings, bunching tightly together in agile, watchful groups. They snatched mouthfuls on the move, and ate less overall.</p><p>  就黄石公园的麋鹿和m鹿而言，狼的归来改变了一切。尽管他们在整个过程中都面临着掠夺-尤其是带着枪的人类-他们已经习惯于自由地在开阔的土地上铣削，在四处觅食。迄今为止，相对和平的阳光普照的林间空地和芬芳的鼠尾草草甸成为了要塞，它们成为目标。他们变得神经质，犹豫。他们在整个活动中不断前进，紧密地聚集在敏捷的观察小组中。他们在移动中抢了口，吃了更少的食物。</p><p> Around the same time as the wolves were released, the mountain lion population, once hunted to local extinction, was becoming re-established as well – having crept back in from wilderness areas in central Idaho. Under these twin pressures, over a period of about 15 years, elk numbers halved.</p><p> 大约在释放狼的同时，曾经被猎杀到局部灭绝的美洲狮种群也正在重新建立起来-从爱达荷州中部的荒野中返回来。在这种双重压力下，在大约15年的时间内，麋鹿数量减少了一半。</p><p> Those that did survive behaved differently, too: when the wolves were on the prowl, they retreated to the dimly lit comfort of the woods, where they might wander in clandestine bands. They avoided the cougars, most active at night, by steering clear of landmarks where they might be trapped or surprised from above in the dark – ravines, outcrops, embankments. No longer did they live in an environment defined by its waterholes and pastures, or even by its ridgelines and ravines, but by areas now suffused with danger and relief. A psychological topology, this – one marked with hillocks of anxiety and peaks of alarm. Ecologists know this as “the landscape of fear”.</p><p> 幸存者的行为也有所不同：狼群四处寻觅时，它们退缩到昏暗的树林中，可能会在秘密地带徘徊。他们避开了可能被困在黑暗中或从上方被惊吓的地标-山沟，露头和堤防，从而避免了夜间最活跃的美洲狮。他们不再生活在水坑和牧场，甚至山脊和山沟所界定的环境中，而是生活在如今充满危险和救济的地区。这是一种心理拓扑结构，以焦虑和警报高峰为特征。生态学家将其称为“恐惧景观”。</p><p> And as the deer’s psychological landscape metamorphosed in the presence of the wolves, so too did the physical landscape that underlay it. As deer numbers fell and grazing habits changed, the willow, cottonwood and aspen seedlings they had been stripping from the clearings were granted a reprieve. Undergrowth thickened. Leafy stands grew up along the river edges. In this way, fear is a force that shapes the world.</p><p> 鹿的心理环境在狼的存在下发生了变质，构成它的物理环境也变了。随着鹿数量的减少和放牧习性的改变，他们从空地中剥下的柳树，杨木和白杨树幼苗获得了缓刑。灌木丛变厚。绿树成荫的林立在河边。这样，恐惧就是塑造世界的力量。</p><p> Across the Atlantic, European environmentalists were paying close attention. Some were interested in what change these self-willed wolves might wreak upon their old haunts. Others were more interested in, essentially, their application – how wolves might be used as a tool of rewilding and reforestation. Wolves might, they hypothesised, be a way by which ecosystems thrown wildly out of kilter could be brought back into some form of balance. The big bad wolf has returned to favour, in certain ecological circles, at least.</p><p>在整个大西洋上，欧洲环保主义者一直在密切关注。一些人对这些自发的狼可能会改变他们的旧缠身感兴趣。其他人基本上对它们的应用更感兴趣-如何将狼用作野营和重新造林的工具。他们假设，狼可能是一种使狂野灭绝的生态系统恢复平衡的方式。至少在某些生态学界，这头大灰狼已经重新受到青睐。</p><p>  Here in Scotland, red deer have been running rampant for decades. Thanks to the lack of natural predators, and the sporting estates’ habit of feeding them through winter, numbers have more than doubled since 1959, rising from 155,000 to an  estimated 400,000. Highland landowners have been pressed into service as ersatz wolves, and are now required by law to spend months stalking smooth-skinned hills – bitten down to the quick by hungry mouths – with loaded rifles; and  they do so, some more enthusiastically than others. In this way, last year, 80,000 red deer were culled.</p><p>  在苏格兰，几十年来，马鹿一直猖running。由于缺乏天然的捕食者，以及体育馆在冬季喂养它们的习惯，自1959年以来，捕食者的数量已增加了一倍多，从15.5万增加到了40万。高地的土地所有者被迫作为eratz狼来服役，现在法律要求他们花数月的时间跟踪那些装满步枪的光滑皮肤的山丘，这些山丘被饥饿的嘴咬伤得很快。他们这样做，比其他人更热情。这样，去年扑杀了80,000头马鹿。</p><p> Many believe this is nowhere near enough, but it’s a time-consuming, expensive process that swallows up thousands of working hours each year. For this reason, our old enemy has been looking a lot more attractive of late.</p><p> 许多人认为这还远远不够，但这是一个耗时，昂贵的过程，每年要花掉数千个工作时间。因此，我们的老敌人最近看起来更具吸引力。</p><p> But wolves will not return on their own. We are separated from the wolf packs of continental Europe by the sea; if we want wolves in Scotland, haunting the hills, we will have to invite them in.</p><p> 但是狼不会自己回来。我们被欧洲与欧洲大陆的狼群隔开。如果我们想在苏格兰狼群出没，那就不得不邀请他们加入。</p><p> The hunting lodge at Alladale sits on a low rise, overlooking the glens that form the body of Paul Lister’s Highland estate, 30 miles inland from the monument at Brora. It’s a grand, stone-built Victorian country house with bay windows and high ceilings. When I arrive there on a hot summer’s day, I find a half-dozen stags dozing peacefully on the lawn, looking sleek and lithe, docile as cows, their antlers trimmed with a velvet of russet and gold.</p><p> 阿拉代尔（Alladale）的狩猎小屋位于一栋低层建筑上，俯瞰着保罗·李斯特（Paul Lister）高地庄园的遗迹，该庄园距离Brora纪念碑的内陆地区30英里。这是一幢宏伟的，石头建造的维多利亚式乡间别墅，带有凸窗和高高的天花板。当我在炎热的夏日到达那里时，我发现有六只雄鹿在草坪上安静地打zing，看起来圆滑而轻盈，像牛一样温顺，鹿角用赤褐色和金色的天鹅绒修剪。</p><p>  I step towards them, right up to them, almost – I’m maybe three metres away when they finally heave to their feet and swing to face me, almost defiantly, before trotting into the trees that mark the edge of the garden. “No fear,” comments Lister. That’s the problem.</p><p>  我几乎朝他们走来，直到他们走近–当他们终于站起来，几乎挑衅地摆向我时，我大概在三米外，然后小跑到标志着花园边缘的树木上。 “不用担心，”李斯特评论道。那就是问题所在。</p><p> The land at Alladale is steeply pitched, dramatic, desperately beautiful. But as a landscape of fear, this time of year, it is smooth and almost featureless. The deer will head up to the high ground over winter, he says, during the stalking season, when all bets are off. But for now they are safe. “They know, well enough, when it’s time to go.”</p><p> 阿拉代尔（Alladale）的土地陡峭起伏，戏剧性，绝望美丽。但是作为恐惧的风景，一年中的这个时候，它是平稳的，几乎没有特色。他说，在缠扰季节中，当所有赌注都消失的时候，这头鹿会在整个冬季登上高地。但是目前他们是安全的。 “他们知道，什么时候该走。”</p><p> Lister is a vigorous man, slim and tanned, in his 60s. The heir to a vast fortune made in furniture, he has been sinking a sizeable part of it into the rewilding of this Highland estate since he bought it in 2003. Back then, there were 25 deer per square km; today, through a combination of “population management” – that is, shooting them – and extensive deer fencing, his staff have brought that figure down to four or five. These days, he doesn’t call it an estate, but a “wilderness reserve”.</p><p>李斯特（Lister）是个60岁左右的朝气蓬勃，苗条又黝黑的人。自从他在2003年购买家具以来，他一直是家具业的巨大财富的继承人，他一直将其中很大一部分投入到这个高地庄园的荒野中。那时，每平方公里有25头鹿。如今，通过“种群管理”（即射击）和广泛的鹿围栏相结合，他的员工将这一数字降低到了四五。如今，他不再称其为庄园，而是“荒野保护区”。</p><p> Whatever you want to call it, the results of the work are tangible, easily visible to the naked eye. We bump down a track in a Land Rover to view how this is a place shivering with summer foliage, so unlike the naked hollows of the glens I know so well – those cavernous spaces, those glacial curves. Birch and aspen tremble along the river’s edge, swollen with the very last of the snowmelt. Scots pine shin up the very steepest slopes, bilberries blooming in their shadow. None of this came about by accident. These trees were planted in batches, tens of thousands of them at a time. The oldest are now approaching two decades in the ground, and are maturing in safety, behind 6ft-high fences that march along the road’s edge and then up and over the ridgeline. Between their branches, unseen, scamper red squirrels: native to the area but boosted by releases from elsewhere. Back at the lodge, wildcat kittens romp in a pen, part of a reintroduction project that could see them set loose within a couple of years. All of it part of the same grand plan.</p><p> 无论您想称它为什么，工作的结果都是有形的，用肉眼很容易看到。我们沿着陆虎的一条小路撞下来，以查看这是一个充满夏日叶子的瑟瑟发抖的地方，因此与我所熟知的裸露的凹痕不同-那些海绵状的空间，那些冰川的弯曲。桦木和白杨沿着河的边缘颤抖，最后融化的雪肿了。苏格兰松树在最陡峭的山坡上发光，越桔在阴影中绽放。这些都不是偶然产生的。这些树木被分批种植，一次种植了成千上万。现在最古老的地面已经接近二十年，并且在6英尺高的篱笆后面安全地成熟，篱笆沿着道路的边缘行进，然后越过山脊线。在它们的分支之间，看不见的，散落着的红色松鼠：原产于该地区，但受到其他地方释放的刺激。回到小屋，野猫小猫用钢笔围住，这是重新引入项目的一部分，该项目可能会导致它们在几年内松动。所有这些都是同一宏伟计划的一部分。</p><p> But what Lister really wants is this: a 50,000-acre enclosure within which wolves run free alongside the deer and the rabbits and the squirrels and the wildcats and all else. The hope is that the wolves would take it upon themselves to “manage” the deer population, starting with the weakest – the old, the sick, the starving – and working up, keeping them on their toes, on the move, relieving the grazing pressure on the hills and thus liberating the land to attain a level of fertility not seen for centuries.</p><p> 但是，李斯特（Lister）真正想要的是：一个50,000英亩的围栏，狼在其中与鹿，兔子，松鼠，野猫和其他所有动物自由奔跑。希望是狼能够承担起“管理”鹿种群的责任，从最弱的人（老弱，病残，挨饿）开始，努力工作，使他们保持脚尖，移动，减轻放牧山丘上的压力，从而解放了土地，达到了数百年来未曾见过的肥沃水平。</p><p> Lister views this as a way to restore a crucial self-righting mechanism to an ecosystem thrown haywire, an ecosystem where “nothing makes sense” any more. Morally speaking, he says, “it’s the right thing to do”. Before, we killed the wolves and the bears and the lynx – trapped them, bludgeoned them, flayed them alive – “because they were inconvenient to us. What gave us the right to eliminate other species? It’s disgusting. So when we have the opportunity to put something back, albeit in a controlled way, it should fill us with joy.”</p><p> 李斯特（Lister）认为，这是将重要的自我修复机制恢复到被抛弃的生态系统中的一种方法，该生态系统不再“毫无意义”。从道德上讲，他说，“这是正确的事情”。在此之前，我们杀死了狼，熊和山猫，将它们困住，将它们刺成短棍，使它们存活下来。“因为它们给我们带来了不便。是什么赋予了我们消除其他物种的权利？那真令人恶心。因此，当我们有机会放回某些东西时，尽管它是有控制的，但它应该使我们充满喜悦。”</p><p>  Still,  his plan – heavily modelled on the game reserves of South Africa – retains a great deal of hands-on interference with the “natural way of things”. The wolves themselves would require population management. “If you put a pack of wolves in here, they’re soon going to make two packs, then you have to step in and neuter the females. It’s the only way to do it.” The game reserves do it all the time – “play God” – but perhaps it’s the best we could hope for in a broken world.</p><p>  尽管如此，他的计划（以南非的禁猎区为模型）仍然保留了对“自然事物”的大量动手干预。狼本身需要进行人口管理。 “如果您在这里放一包狼，它们很快就会制造两包，那么您就必须介入，绝育雌性。这是唯一的方法。”游戏储备一直在发挥作用-“扮演上帝”-但也许这是我们在破碎世界中希望得到的最好成绩。</p><p>   Lister’s wolf plan – limited though it is in scope – has met with stiff resistance from almost every corner. Trembling voices speak up at public meetings, frightened for their safety. Bureaucratic hurdles emerge that may prove insurmountable: animal welfare controls prevent the keeping of predators and prey enclosed together; hikers point to their right to roam Scottish lands, enshrined in law. People here, says Lister, have forgotten what it means to live alongside predators. They are obsessed with livestock, their helpless pets. They kick and squeal, refuse to adapt their ways for a wilder future. What could it cost us, this risk aversion? While we’ve been wringing our hands over a few dozen beavers, refusing even to countenance the reintroduction of lynx, Europe has been rewilding of its own accord. Wolves brook no bureaucracy. They do not believe in borders.</p><p>   李斯特的狼计划虽然范围有限，但几乎每个角落都遭到了坚决的抵制。颤抖的声音在公开会议上大声疾呼，为他们的安全感到恐惧。出现官僚主义的障碍，可能证明是无法克服的：动物福利控制措施阻止将捕食者和猎物围在一起。远足者指出了他们漫游在法律所规定的苏格兰土地上的权利。李斯特说，这里的人们已经忘记了与掠食者同住意味着什么。他们沉迷于牲畜，无助的宠物。他们踢和尖叫，拒绝适应自己的方式，以实现更广阔的未来。这种风险规避可能会使我们付出什么呢？尽管我们一直在争夺几十只海狸，甚至拒绝表彰山猫的引入，但欧洲却一直在迷惑自己。狼不容忍任何官僚主义。他们不相信边界。</p><p> It has been years since we have come face to face with apex predators in our own country. If our fear was a landscape, it would be a prairie, a great plain. The threats we face now are constructions of our devising.</p><p> 自从我们与自己国家的顶级掠食者面对面以来已有好几年了。如果我们的恐惧是一片风景，那将是一个草原，一个大平原。我们现在面临的威胁是我们的构想。</p><p> Our fear of wolves is out of all proportion to the danger they pose us. Wolves very rarely attack humans, and even actively avoid us. One might live a lifetime in the woods with a pack of wolves for neighbours and never see a single one. When thinking of reintroductions, we must be circumspect, realistic: the risk of wolf attack is small. Tiny, even. Still, it is not zero.</p><p>我们对狼的恐惧与它们对我们构成的危险不成比例。狼很少攻击人类，甚至积极躲避我们。一个人可能会在森林中一生带一包狼为邻居而生活，却再也看不到一头狼了。在考虑重新引入时，我们必须谨慎行事，切合实际：狼袭击的风险很小。很小，甚至。仍然不为零。</p><p>  Mark Mennle knows well the risks that wolves can bring. Mark is in his mid-40s, a shepherd from Prignitz, in Brandenburg, in the east of Germany. An itinerant shepherd, he grazes his flock of 600 sheep on state-owned grassland and between the panels of solar farms in a region where wolves have firmly re-established themselves in the space of a decade.</p><p>  马克·门奈（Mark Mennle）非常了解狼可能带来的风险。马克（Mark）40岁左右，是德国东部勃兰登堡州普里尼茨（Prignitz）的牧羊人。他是一个流浪的牧羊人，在国有草原上以及在十年之内狼群已经牢固地重建自己的地区的太阳能农场的板块之间放牧了600只绵羊。</p><p> He, like all farmers in the area, has had to adapt his practices to the wolves’ return. In some parts of Europe – mountainous regions, where the sheep roam free – shepherds have reverted to rearing more “primitive” breeds, better able to fend for themselves against a predator’s threat. In Brandenburg, a flat, rather sandy, plain crisscrossed with rivers and ribbed by dykes, Mennle uses specialist electric fencing, pinning it to the ground to stop wolves getting in underneath. He uses more traditional methods, too: he had to trade in his quick, compliant sheepdogs for a powerful, bear-like breed – the Illyrian shepherd dog – that lives in among the sheep as their protectors. But the dogs themselves can be difficult to handle. It’s a hard balance to strike: they must be safe to coexist with ramblers and cyclists, but aggressive enough to start a fight with a wolf. Like hiring Hells Angels as security: things can go sour fast. Last year, a man came by, walking a pet dog – a scrappy little thing that strained at the lead and barked. One of Mennle’s guard dogs grabbed it, pulling the lead from its owner’s grip, and killed it. The furious man came at Mennle with a stick.</p><p> 像该地区的所有农民一样，他不得不适应狼群的回归。在欧洲的某些地区（山区，绵羊无处游走），牧羊人已开始饲养更多的“原始”品种，能够更好地抵御捕食者的威胁。在勃兰登堡州，一片平坦而多沙的平原，纵横交错，河流纵横交错，被堤坝所包围，门内尔使用专业的电子围栏将其钉在地面上，以阻止狼群进入下方。他也使用了更传统的方法：他不得不用自己快速，合规的牧羊犬来换取一种强大的，像熊一样的品种-伊利里亚牧羊犬-它生活在绵羊中间作为保护者。但是狗本身可能很难处理。很难达到平衡：它们必须安全地与漫步者和骑自行车者共存，但必须具有足够的侵略性才能与狼打架。就像雇用“地狱天使”一样安全：事情会很快变坏。去年，一个人走过，walking着一只爱犬-一块杂乱无章的小东西，紧紧抓住铅，吠叫着。 Mennle的一只护卫犬抓住了它，将铅从所有者的握柄中拉出并杀死了它。那个怒气冲冲的人拿着棍子来到了孟尔。</p><p> He has 17 of these guard dogs now. They are expensive animals, each one worth far more than a sheep. “Last year, I had to explain to my seven-year-old daughter that I couldn’t get her a Christmas present because I had to buy a new dog. That was heartbreaking.” He doesn’t own his land. At this rate – the extra costs of security, the growing losses – he never will. For even with the dogs, his flock is not safe.</p><p> 他现在有17只这些护卫犬。它们是昂贵的动物，每个动物的价值都远远超过绵羊。 “去年，我不得不向我的7岁女儿解释说，因为要买一条新狗，我无法给她送圣诞礼物。真令人伤心。”他不拥有自己的土地。以这种速度-额外的安全成本，不断增长的损失-他永远不会。因为即使有狗，他的羊群也不安全。</p><p> On 1 March, his phone rang at 7.30am. It was the police, calling to tell him there had been an attack. When Mennle reached the paddock where the assault had taken place, he could see the ravens circling. He knew at once, he says now, that something terrible had happened. What he found there was carnage, a desperate scene: 12 sheep dead – shredded – a dismembered mess. Eight more ewes lay broken and bleeding in the grass, some still breathing, heavily pregnant, in the process of dying. Others had gone into labour out of shock, only for the wolves to kill the infant lambs as they emerged. Another 30, Mennle later realised, had been taken, never to be seen again.</p><p> 3月1日，他的电话在上午7.30响。是警察，打电话告诉他发生了袭击。当Mennle到达发生袭击的围场时，他可以看到乌鸦盘旋。他现在说，他立刻知道发生了一件可怕的事。他发现那里是大屠杀，一个绝望的景象：12头羊被杀死，被切成碎片，被肢解成一团。另外八头母羊躺在草地上破裂破裂，流血不断，有些还在呼吸，怀孕严重，正在死亡。其他人则出于震惊而投入工作，只是为了让狼杀死幼小羔羊。 Mennle后来意识到，又有30个人被带走，再也看不到了。</p><p> Massacres like this – killing beyond all possible hunger, as if for sport – are not unknown among wolves. When hunting deer, they will separate their victim from the herd and seize it; when it falls, its fellow deer will run, abandoning it to its doom. But sheep are different. They stay together. Even as the wolves are stripping their sisters for parts, they herd ever more tightly together, bleating, ready for slaughter. Blood-crazed wolves, adrenaline pumping, will kill, and kill, and kill. As Mark rushed to the scene, he had been struggling to align what the police had told him with what he knew of his animals. He had left the flock miles from here, grazing contentedly, only the night before. The wolves hunted them for 5km,” he says. “Can you imagine that?”</p><p> 像这样的屠杀-杀灭一切可能的饥饿感，就像运动一样-在狼群中并不陌生。在猎鹿时，他们会将受害者与牛群隔离开来并抓住它；当它掉落时，它的同伴鹿将奔跑，将其抛弃。但是绵羊是不同的。他们在一起。甚至在狼将其姐妹剥去一部分的同时，它们也更加紧密地聚集在一起，流血，准备宰杀。狂血的狼，肾上腺素泵浦，将杀死，杀死并杀死。马克赶到现场时，他一直在努力使警察告诉他的一切与他对动物的了解保持一致。他只在前一天晚上就离开了那群羊，离开那里只有几英里。狼狩猎了他们5公里。”他说。 “你能想象得到吗？”</p><p> He gets financial recompense from the state, but – he says – not enough to cover the costs. That’s not the worst part. “It’s the images I can’t get out of my head. You feel for your sheep. You don’t want them to suffer. The bloodbath in the field is not comparable to what the butcher is doing.” This was the sixth attack since 2016. They’re getting worse. Altogether, he’s lost about 300 sheep to the wolves. Still, he hasn’t thought about giving up. The prospect confounds him. What else would he do?</p><p> 他从州获得经济补偿，但是-他说-不足以支付费用。那不是最糟糕的部分。 “这是我无法摆脱的图像。你为你的羊感到。您不希望他们受苦。现场的血腥屠杀与屠夫的行为无法相比。”这是自2016年以来的第六次袭击。他一共损失了约300只绵羊。不过，他还没有考虑放弃。前景使他感到困惑。他还会做什么？</p><p>  As wolf numbers rise across the continent – as packs grow, split and reform – here we sit on our island, watching through our fingers, patrolling our perimeters. There is no serious consideration of releasing wolves into the UK countryside – at least, not in the foreseeable future.</p><p>随着整个大陆上狼群数量的增加-种群的增加，分裂和改良-在这里，我们坐在我们的岛上，用手指看着，在外围巡逻。没有认真考虑过将狼释放到英国的乡下，至少在可预见的将来。</p><p> Efforts to reintroduce the comparatively small and harmless lynx, for example – seen by some as a stepping stone to the ultimate goal of bringing back wolves – remain extremely controversial, while beavers “unofficially” released into Scotland’s Tayside 15 years ago, where they continue to thrive, are a major source of contention.</p><p> 例如，重新引入相对较小和无害的山猫的努力（在某些人看来是实现重新夺回狼的最终目标的垫脚石）仍然极富争议，而海狸在15年前“非正式地”投放到苏格兰的泰赛德，在那里他们继续蓬勃发展，是争用的主要来源。</p><p> Farmers, perhaps fairly, feel they have enough to contend</p><p> 农民也许公平地认为他们有足够的竞争能力</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/24/landscape-of-fear-why-we-need-the-wolf-rewilding-scotland">https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/24/landscape-of-fear-why-we-need-the-wolf-rewilding-scotland</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/需要/">#需要</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/wolf/">#wolf</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/土地/">#土地</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
