When I finally realized through personal experimentation and research that the best mattress is no mattress, I could never look at the world the same. We are asleep when it comes to which bed is the best bed.</p><p>我花了30年时间想知道该睡什么才能获得最佳睡眠和健康。当我最终通过个人实验和研究意识到最好的床垫是没有床垫的时候，我再也看不到同样的世界了。说到哪张床是最好的床，我们都睡着了。</p><p>  I discovered that the mattress is creating and/or masking the body’s current structural imbalances, impeding circulation and hampering the body from realigning itself during sleep. Sleeping on a hard surface can reshape the back and realign the body. A firm sleep surface helps the body’s relationship with gravity, with the earth. This is a therapeutic practice available to all of us, which works while we sleep.</p><p>我发现床垫正在制造和/或掩盖身体当前的结构失衡，阻碍循环，阻碍身体在睡眠中自我调整。在坚硬的地面上睡觉可以重塑背部，重新调整身体。坚实的睡眠表面有助于身体与重力、与地球的关系。这是一种对我们所有人都有效的治疗方法，在我们睡觉时有效。</p><p> The bedding industry relies on bold claims that one mattress or pillow will outperform another. Some of the claims are tempting, promising a good night’s sleep like you’ve never had before–for only a few thousand dollars.</p><p>床上用品行业依赖于大胆的说法，即一个床垫或枕头的表现优于另一个。其中一些说法很诱人，承诺只需几千美元就可以睡个好觉，这是你从未有过的。</p><p> Where are ‘they’ getting this information? Sleep and health are intricately related. There is no scientific definition of ‘comfort.’ Sleep and especially deep sleep with theta and delta brain waves is known to restore health. How does the actual bed or surface upon which one sleeps affect the quality of sleep?</p><p>“他们”从哪里得到这些信息？睡眠和健康有着错综复杂的关系。“舒适”没有科学的定义众所周知，睡眠，尤其是深度睡眠和θ和δ脑电波可以恢复健康。一个人睡觉的实际床或表面是如何影响睡眠质量的？</p><p> When I researched for months trying to find an intelligent, scientific article on what type of bed will provide deep, rejuvenating sleep, I could not find it. None of the research seems to know specifically anything about this. The statements are not definitive and claims are not backed up, or are backed up with dubious studies. Even the terms ‘comfort,’ ‘soft,’ and ‘healthy’ are not defined. No studies measure the important health indicators, like pulse, heart rate, levels of stress hormones as related to the type of surface being used.</p><p>当我研究了几个月，试图找到一篇关于什么样的床能提供深度、恢复活力的睡眠的智能、科学的文章时，我找不到它。这些研究似乎都不知道这方面的具体情况。这些声明并不确定，声明也没有得到支持，或者有可疑研究的支持。甚至“舒适”、“柔软”和“健康”这三个术语也没有定义。没有研究测量重要的健康指标，如脉搏、心率、与所使用表面类型相关的应激激素水平。</p><p>  Most ‘authorities’ seem confused and baffled. For instance the Mayo Clinic says: “If you have chronic low back pain, you may benefit from sleeping on a medium-firm mattress. Consider trying out a medium-firm mattress before you buy. However, you may find your back pain is reduced with a softer mattress.” (1)</p><p>大多数“当局”似乎感到困惑和困惑。例如，梅奥诊所说：“如果你有慢性腰痛，你可能会受益于睡在一个中等坚固的床垫上。在买之前考虑试用一个中等坚固的床垫。但是，你可能会发现你的背痛是用一个柔软的床垫减少的。”(1)</p><p> There is no stated cause of low back pain. If the cause is unknown, then the cure must be too. Second, the terms ‘medium firm’ and density are not defined. How can the Mayo Clinic be satisfied with this recommendation, based on absolutely nothing?</p><p>没有明确的原因导致腰痛。如果病因不明，那么治疗方法也必须如此。其次，“中等企业”和“密度”这两个术语没有定义。梅奥诊所怎么会对这个毫无根据的建议感到满意呢？</p><p> I found other statements such as: “a bed shouldn’t be too hard or too soft” or “What works for some people doesn’t work for others.” Sleep science research seems to have completely left out the body and how it interacts with the sleep environment.</p><p>我还发现了其他一些说法，比如：“床不应该太硬或太软”，或者“对某些人有效的东西对其他人无效”睡眠科学研究似乎完全忽略了身体及其与睡眠环境的相互作用。</p><p> What is the specific density of a ‘medium-firm’ mattress, or any other mattress for that matter? Why–in physiological terms–does one surface have a different effect on the body than another surface? What about respiration and air flow through the mattress? Or synthetic vs. non-synthetic? But even more fundamentally: Do we need a mattress at all?I had some hunches–pardon the expression–which started the whole search in the first place. From restorative yoga I got the paradigm that certain positions could induce specific calming responses, relaxing the autonomic nervous system. The New Ergonomics believes the bones need to have some resistance (i.e. a hard surface). From science I knew about the different stages of sleep and how rejuvenating sleep happens during the third and fourth stages. From nutrition I knew that certain vitamins and minerals were needed for the best sleep, and heavy metals in the body can disrupt deeper stages of sleep. Yet the truth of what specific mattress would be optimal for comfort and rejuvenation remained unanswered.</p><p>“中等硬度”床垫或其他床垫的密度是多少？为什么——从生理学角度讲——一个表面对身体的影响不同于另一个表面？呼吸和空气流经床垫的情况如何？还是合成与非合成？但更根本的是：我们需要床垫吗？我有一些预感——请原谅我的表情——这从一开始就开始了整个搜索。从恢复性瑜伽中，我得到了一个范例，即某些姿势可以诱导特定的镇静反应，放松自主神经系统。新的人体工程学认为骨骼需要有一定的阻力（即坚硬的表面）。从科学上，我知道了睡眠的不同阶段，以及在第三和第四阶段如何使睡眠恢复活力。从营养学上，我知道最佳睡眠需要某些维生素和矿物质，而体内的重金属会扰乱更深层次的睡眠。然而，什么样的床垫最适合舒适和恢复活力，这个事实仍然没有答案。</p><p> One thing I knew, everyone is dealing with the same thing. Hardly a day passes that I don’t overhear some conversation about sleep, and generally the problem with getting a good night’s sleep.</p><p>有一件事我知道，每个人都在处理同一件事。几乎每天我都会无意中听到一些关于睡眠的对话，以及关于如何获得良好睡眠的问题。</p><p>  I am skeptical of technological fixes, which are usually touted as the answer to society’s sleeping problems. The extent to the complexity of the bedding industry has become absurd. It is not uncommon for a couple to spend thousands of dollars on the ‘perfect’ mattress system. If this really worked, it would seem that by now, most people at least in America would have solved the sleeping problem and be wide-eye-and-bushy-tailed ready to start the day. But this isn’t the case at all, as anyone who picks up a magazine or watches a few minutes of TV will soon see, with advertisements for sleep aids, sleep drugs, better mattresses, orthopedic pillows, and stimulant drugs.</p><p>我对技术修复持怀疑态度，它们通常被吹捧为解决社会睡眠问题的方法。床上用品行业的复杂程度已经变得荒谬。一对夫妇花费数千美元购买“完美”床垫系统并不罕见。如果这真的奏效，那么现在看来，至少在美国，大多数人已经解决了睡眠问题，睁大了眼睛，留着浓密的尾巴，准备开始新的一天。但事实并非如此，任何一个拿起杂志或看几分钟电视的人很快就会看到，有助于睡眠的广告、睡眠药物、更好的床垫、矫形枕头和兴奋剂。</p><p> The assumed paradigm is that a mattress is essential to good sleep just like a chair is essential to sitting. But why did mattresses become mainstream? When did the buffalo robe and pile of leaves go out of fashion? Could a good night’s sleep be had if, for instance, we slept on a sandy beach or the equivalent? Why did ‘they’ start saying a firm bed is best, and still provide a two to three foot thick ‘system’ of mattresses just to get you to that ‘firm bed’ effect?</p><p>假设的范例是，床垫对良好睡眠至关重要，就像椅子对坐姿至关重要一样。但是为什么床垫会成为主流呢？水牛袍和一堆叶子什么时候过时了？例如，如果我们睡在沙滩或类似的地方，能睡个好觉吗？为什么“他们”开始说坚固的床是最好的，但仍然提供两到三英尺厚的“系统”床垫，只是为了让你达到“坚固的床”的效果？</p><p>  Some of the questions came up as I experimented napping and sleeping on different surfaces, including beaches, boulders by the river, grass, and just the bare ground. My conclusion was that almost anything seemed to work, and the best surfaces were those most removed from the modern box-spring bed, the waterbed, or the memory foam bed.</p><p>当我尝试在不同的地面上打盹和睡觉时，其中一些问题出现了，包括海滩、河边的巨石、草地和光秃秃的地面。我的结论是，几乎任何东西似乎都能起作用，最好的表面是那些从现代箱式弹簧床、水床或记忆泡沫床上移除最多的表面。</p><p> Finally I started turning up some information. A former Japanese health pioneer Katsuzo Nishi published a book in 1927 detailing a system of exercises and practices which include sleeping on a hard surface such as a board, to help with spinal alignment and circulation. Here is an excerpt from the Nishi website.</p><p>最后我找到了一些信息。1927年，日本前健康先驱西胜胜出版了一本书，详细介绍了一套锻炼和练习系统，其中包括在硬表面（如木板）上睡觉，以帮助脊柱对齐和循环。以下是西岛网站的摘录。</p><p> His theories are characterized by the idea that, in spite of the fact that the human bone structure and positioning of the internal organs are basically the same as those evolved for the mammalian species that ambulate on four legs, human beings’ upright, two-legged life style places certain structural strains on the human bone structure, resulting in problems like obstruction of the flow of food through the intestines (constipation) due to the unnatural (vertical) positioning of the organs. As methods to compensate for these structural defects, Nishi conceived and encouraged the use of treatment through exercises such as the goldfish (movement) style spinal column rectification exercise and the Nishi-shiki health fortifying technique( (lateral vibration exercise know as the “Haifuku Undo”).</p><p>他的理论的特点是，尽管人类的骨骼结构和内脏器官的位置基本上与四条腿行走的哺乳动物物种的骨骼结构和位置相同，但人类直立、两腿的生活方式对人类的骨骼结构造成了一定的结构张力，由于器官的不自然（垂直）定位，导致肠道内食物流动受阻（便秘）等问题。作为弥补这些结构缺陷的方法，Nishi设想并鼓励通过金鱼（运动）式脊柱矫正练习和Nishi-shiki健康强化技术（横向振动练习称为“海福-松手”）等练习进行治疗。</p><p>  Furthermore, based on the structure of the human network of arteries and veins, Nishi refuted the heart-driven blood circulation theory of William Harvey, proposing instead a theory that the capillaries provided the true driving force of the circulatory system. And, in order to compensate for the obstruction of circulation in the four limbs resulting from the human species’ vertical posture, he proposed the Capillary Action- Inducing exercise (Mokan Undo), which involves lying on the back, raising the arms and legs and applying a slight vibrating motion.</p><p>此外，基于人体动脉和静脉网络的结构，Nishi驳斥了William Harvey的心脏驱动血液循环理论，提出了毛细血管是循环系统真正驱动力的理论。此外，为了补偿人类垂直姿势造成的四肢循环障碍，他提出了毛细血管动作诱导运动（Mokan Undo），包括仰卧、抬起手臂和腿，并进行轻微的振动运动。</p><p> Besides these exercises, Nishi also recommended methods making use of implements like a hard, half –cylinder pillow, design to keep the cerebral vertebrae in the ideal position from a structural standpoint and a flat sleeping platform (flat board) designed to do the same for the vertebrae of the spinal column. (2)</p><p>除了这些练习之外，Nishi还推荐了一些方法，比如使用坚硬的半圆筒枕头，从结构的角度来看，其设计可以使大脑脊椎保持在理想的位置，以及设计用于脊柱脊椎的平面睡眠平台（平板）。(2)</p><p> This is at least anecdotal evidence that mattresses in general are bad for our health from a structural and metabolic perspective. Whether they are brand new or worn out makes no difference. My hypothesis is that mattresses insulate us from our experience of our body. They do not allow the resistance that we need to keep us in alignment and optimize breathing and circulation. When it comes to a mattress, more is not better. Less is better.</p><p>从结构和代谢的角度来看，这至少是床垫对我们健康有害的传闻证据。它们是全新的还是破旧的都没有区别。我的假设是，床垫将我们与我们的身体体验隔离开来。它们不允许我们保持一致、优化呼吸和循环所需的阻力。说到床垫，越多越好。越少越好。</p><p>  The whole concept of a mattress, a deep, soft place to rest our tired bones, is mistaken. More rejuvenation comes from less fluff. It doesn’t take something two feet thick to provide the hardness of a simple cot or a pallet on the floor. The traditional Japanese had it right with their sitting as well as their sleeping. Their mattresses (futons) are about the thickness of a typical quilt. No doubt, Nishi’s recommendations had something to do with the reason that some Japanese people still use traditional Japanese sleeping habits, even though Western furniture is available.</p><p>床垫是一个深而软的地方，可以让我们疲惫的骨头得到休息，这种想法是错误的。更多的活力来自于更少的绒毛。它不需要两英尺厚的东西就能提供一个简单的床或地板上的托盘的硬度。传统的日本人对他们的坐姿和睡眠都很在行。他们的床垫（蒲团）的厚度与典型的被子差不多。毫无疑问，西西的建议与一些日本人仍然使用日本传统睡眠习惯的原因有关，尽管有西方家具可供选择。</p><p>  Yet again I was experimenting–this time sleeping on a thin cotton blanket folded in half. I could hardly believe it. After all these years of troubling over having a good bed, even what was considered a hard bed, to my surprise, I actually slept at least as well on practically nothing. I’m not saying it felt luxurious or soft, but I slept well and felt even better upon awakening. I could see what Nishi was saying about improved circulation to the extremities. When the surface is very firm like a board, there is nothing to push up against the muscles. The bones take the brunt of the pressure so the muscles with arteries and veins and free. I also wonder if perhaps this resistance against the bones might encourage bone density while we sleep, and soft mattresses therefore might influence bone loss. This would make a great study but I can’t find any already performed.</p><p>我又一次在做实验——这次我睡在一张叠成两半的薄棉毯上。我简直不敢相信。多年来，我一直为拥有一张好床而烦恼，哪怕是被认为是一张硬床，但令我惊讶的是，我实际上什么都没睡，至少睡得一样好。我并不是说它感觉奢华或柔软，但我睡得很好，醒来后感觉更好。我能看出Nishi所说的改善四肢循环的话。当表面像木板一样坚硬时，就没有任何东西可以向上推压肌肉。骨骼承受着压力的冲击，所以肌肉有动脉和静脉，并且是自由的。我还想知道，这种对骨骼的抵抗是否会在我们睡觉时促进骨密度，因此软床垫可能会影响骨质流失。这将是一个伟大的研究，但我找不到任何已经执行。</p><p>  Although many Japanese sleep in beds these days, it is still common to sleep on a futon mattress spread on the floor. Westerners call the small couch which turns into a bed a futon, but that is very different from the traditional Japanese futon. A traditional Japanese futon set includes shikibuton (under futon), kakebuton (comforters), and makura (pillow)… Shikibuton is usually stuffed with cotton batting and is wrapped in shikifu (sheets). Japanese uses different types of futon, depending on the season, such as light ones in summer and heavy ones in winter. Futon made from down feathers is light and comfortable but is most expensive. Kakebuton is covered by kakebuton cover. The traditional Japanese pillow (makura) is filled with red beans or buckwheat chaff… Futon is usually put away during the day in the closet called oshiire. The oshiire closet has sliding doors and usually divided into two shelves. It is best to keep the futon on the upper shelf. Japanese houses are usually small and do not have many rooms, so a room is used for dual purposes. During the day, a room can be used as workroom or guestroom after futon is stored in the oshiire. It is very convenient… It is important to sometimes dry futon under direct sunshine. You may ruin your futon if you keep them in the closet or spread on the floor all the time. Remember that Japan is very humid especially in rainy season. There is a product called futon kansouki (futon dryer) in Japan. Just place the dryer between kakebuton and shikibuton while it is spread on the floor. Airing your futon really helps you sleep well… Also, it is commonly said that sleeping on futon is better for the back than sleeping on a soft bed. The hardness of the floor seems to be good for people who have back problems.</p><p>虽然现在很多日本人都睡在床上，但睡在铺在地板上的蒲团床垫上仍然很常见。西方人把变成床的小沙发称为蒲团，但这与传统的日本蒲团大不相同。传统的日本蒲团套装包括香菇布（蒲团下）、kakebuton（被子）和makura（枕头）……香菇布通常用棉絮填充，并用香菇布（床单）包裹。日本人根据季节的不同，使用不同类型的蒲团，比如夏天的轻蒲团和冬天的重蒲团。羽绒制成的蒲团轻便舒适，但价格最贵。Kakebuton由Kakebuton封面覆盖。传统的日本枕头（makura）里装满了红豆或荞麦糠……蒲团通常在白天放在一个叫oshiire的衣橱里。oshiire壁橱有滑动门，通常分为两个架子。最好把蒲团放在上面的架子上。日本的房子通常很小，房间也不多，所以一个房间有两个用途。白天，蒲团存放在oshiire后，房间可以用作工作室或客房。这很方便…有时在阳光直射下烘干蒲团很重要。如果你一直把蒲团放在壁橱里或摊在地板上，你可能会弄坏你的蒲团。记住，日本非常潮湿，尤其是在雨季。日本有一种叫做futon kansouki（futon干燥器）的产品。只需将烘干机放在kakebuton和shikibuton之间，同时将其摊铺在地板上即可。晾晒你的蒲团真的能帮助你睡个好觉……而且，人们通常说，睡蒲团比睡在柔软的床上更有益于背部。地板的硬度似乎对背部有问题的人有好处。</p><p> In an article in  Science News called “Slumber’s Unexplored Landscape: People in Traditional Societies Sleep in Eye-opening Ways,” Bruce Bower explains why I have had such a hard time finding real information on sleep patterns, behavior, and biology—because—according to Bruce Bower–it has been an ’embarrassingly’ overlooked area of anthropology.</p><p>布鲁斯·鲍尔在《科学新闻》上发表了一篇题为《睡眠未探索的风景：传统社会中的人们以令人大开眼界的方式睡觉》的文章，他解释了为什么我很难找到关于睡眠模式、行为、，生物学是因为根据布鲁斯·鲍尔的说法，它一直是人类学中一个“令人尴尬的”被忽视的领域。</p><p> “Adult sleepers in traditional societies recline on skins, mats, wooden platforms, the ground, or just about anything except a thick, springy mattress. Pillows or head supports are rare, and people doze in whatever they happen to be wearing. Virtually no one, including children, keeps a regular bedtime. Individuals tend to slip in and out of slumber several times during the night. In these unplugged worlds, darkness greatly limits activity and determines the time allotted to sleep. Folks there frequently complain of getting too much sleep, not too little.” (3)</p><p>“在传统社会中，成年睡眠者靠在皮肤、垫子、木平台、地面上，或者除了厚而有弹性的床垫以外的任何东西上。枕头或头枕很少见，人们会在他们碰巧穿的任何东西上打瞌睡。几乎没有人，包括儿童，有固定的就寝时间。个人往往会溜进或溜出贫民窟呃晚上好几次。在这些没有连接的世界里，黑暗极大地限制了人们的活动，并决定了分配给睡眠的时间。那里的人们经常抱怨睡眠太多，而不是太少。" (3)</p><p> My instigating hypothesis that modern beds (mattresses) are not needed and possibly counter-productive was starting to prove plausible. The article also says that a single stint of total sleep–that is the accepted norm by today’s sleep ‘experts’–was not normal for pre-industrial societies and that the advent of artificial lighting has altered the body’s natural circadian rhythms. From reading the few studies conducted on native people’s sleep patterns, one can easily surmise we are barking up the wrong tree when we think a NASA designed mattress will solve our sleep problems.</p><p>我鼓舞人心的假设是，现代床（床垫）是不需要的，而且可能适得其反，这一假设开始被证明是合理的。文章还说，一段时间的完全睡眠——这是当今睡眠“专家”公认的标准——对前工业化社会来说并不正常，人工照明的出现改变了人体的自然昼夜节律。通过阅读为数不多的关于土著人睡眠模式的研究，我们可以很容易地推测，当我们认为NASA设计的床垫可以解决我们的睡眠问题时，我们错了。</p><p> According to an article on WebMD, there are no independent studies showing any bed or mattress has healing powers. “Consumers shouldn’t be lured by claims of therapeutic benefits for beds,” says Charles Cefalu, MD, spokesman for the American Geriatrics Society. He says that “the only beds that can claim to be therapeutic are prescribed by physicians for home use and have the same technology as therapeutic beds used in hospitals to treat burn victims.”</p><p>根据WebMD上的一篇文章，没有独立的研究表明任何床或床垫都有治愈能力。美国老年医学会发言人Charles Cefalu医学博士说：“消费者不应该被床位治疗益处的说法所吸引。”。他说，“唯一可以声称是治疗性的床位是由医生开给家庭使用的，并且拥有与医院用于治疗烧伤患者的治疗性床位相同的技术。”</p><p> This article goes on to say that firm surfaces may be problematic, especially for older sleepers or those with arthritis. It does say, however, that most of these problems can be alleviated with propping and bolstering pillows– especially a pillow under the back of the knees when sleeping on the back.</p><p>这篇文章接着说，坚硬的表面可能会有问题，尤其是对于老年睡眠者或关节炎患者。然而，它确实说，大多数这些问题都可以通过支撑和支撑枕头来缓解，尤其是当仰卧时，放在膝盖后面的枕头。</p><p> A mattress in any true sense of the word causes the hips to sink in and the lower back to collapse, which interrupts natural alignment. Ironically, this is the same effect that chair sitting has on the body. When the back collapses in on itself, whether sitting or lying down, the lungs cannot hold as much oxygen and breathing is immediately hampered. When the body does not get its optimal amount of oxygen, the parasympathetic nervous system which induces relaxation is impeded. When breathing is shallow, the stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol are overproduced–which keeps the body from fully relaxing.</p><p>任何真正意义上的床垫都会导致臀部下沉，下背部塌陷，从而中断自然对齐。讽刺的是，这和坐在椅子上对身体的影响是一样的。当背部自行塌陷时，无论是坐着还是躺着，肺部都无法容纳足够的氧气，呼吸立即受阻。当身体不能获得最佳的氧气量时，引起放松的副交感神经系统就会受到阻碍。当呼吸较浅时，应激激素肾上腺素和皮质醇分泌过多——这使身体无法充分放松。</p><p> The viewpoint of followers of the New Ergonomics is that chair sitting causes ‘front loading’ of the body (see Challenges to Natural Sitting). Since the muscles are tighter in front, the body feels better hunched over to some degree. Likewise, sleeping on a modern mattress causes slumping. Then when we lie down on a firm surface, tight muscles are stretched, which feels uncomfortable. Therefore, we have gotten dependent on a soft bed to maintain the out-of-alignment position, or posture of flexion. It may feel better and even help some people sleep better, because they aren’t being distracted by the body’s attempt to stretch and realign itself. But without the feedback a hard surface offers, deeper problems develop and we don’t reach our full potential.</p><p>新人类工效学的追随者们的观点是，坐在椅子上会导致身体的“前负荷”（参见对自然坐姿的挑战）。由于前面的肌肉更紧，身体在某种程度上感觉更好。同样，睡在现代床垫上也会导致摔倒。然后，当我们躺在坚硬的地面上时，紧绷的肌肉会被拉伸，这会让我们感到不舒服。因此，我们依赖软床来维持不对齐的位置或屈曲姿势。它可能会让人感觉更好，甚至帮助一些人睡得更好，因为他们不会因为身体试图伸展和调整自己而分心。但如果没有坚硬表面提供的反馈，更深层次的问题就会发展，我们无法充分发挥自己的潜力。</p><p> If the mattress does play some role in improving sleep, the best mattress is not a mattress at all, but something more like a pad or a pallet on the floor–something that comes the closest to mimicking the very ground from which humans evolved.</p><p>如果床垫确实在改善睡眠方面发挥了一定作用，那么最好的床垫根本不是床垫，而是更像是地板上的垫子或托盘——最接近人类进化的背景。</p><p>  Of course when first lying down and sleeping on a hard surface, you are probably going to feel uncomfortable. And what is meant by a ‘hard’ surface?  I have personally tested various beds, futons, and natural surfaces over several decades and have come to the conclusion that what mattress manufacturers call ‘firm’ or ‘hard’ does not even come close to the traditional Japanese futon. What describes this quality best is a thick quilt on a floor or board. That bit of padding (about one to two inches of compressed padding) won’t let the hips sink in to mis-align the spine, yet it buffers the body somewhat.</p><p>当然，当你第一次躺在坚硬的地面上睡觉时，你可能会感到不舒服。什么是“硬”表面？几十年来，我亲自测试了各种床、蒲团和自然表面，得出结论，床垫制造商所说的“坚固”或“坚硬”甚至与传统的日本蒲团相去甚远。最能体现这种品质的是地板或木板上的厚被子。这种填充物（大约1到2英寸的压缩填充物）不会让髋部下沉，从而使脊柱错位，但它会在一定程度上缓冲身体。</p><p> From my own experimenting and interviewing people, I have come to the conclusion that this amount of firmness is what works for most Americans who are changing their lifestyle and sleeping habits.  You will need to experiment for yourself to see what works. You can start with napping and later try sleeping this way. It may take more than one night to get used to it. You can gradually go to a harder surface and compare the results.</p><p>通过我自己的实验和采访，我得出了这样一个结论：这种坚定程度对大多数正在改变生活方式和睡眠习惯的美国人来说是有效的。你需要自己做实验，看看什么是有效的。你可以先打盹，然后试着这样睡觉。可能需要一个多晚上才能习惯。你可以慢慢地去比较坚硬的表面，比较结果。</p><p>  The interesting thing I have found upon informally interviewing people who have tried sleeping on firm surfaces is that they complain about it being hard and less comfortable, and yet they sleep very well and feel refreshed upon awakening.  You can sleep on a ‘platform bed’ or the floor. A ‘platform bed” is a simple raised surface where your mat goes, but does not have a true mattress. The platform bed is best for those who don’t want to get down to the floor level. It’s disadvantage is it can’t be put away during the day.</p><p>我在非正式采访那些试图在坚硬的地面上睡觉的人时发现了一件有趣的事，他们抱怨这很难，也不太舒服，但他们睡得很好，醒来后感觉精神焕发。你可以睡在“平台床”或地板上。“平台床”是一个简单的凸起表面，可以放你的垫子，但没有真正的床垫。平台床最适合那些不想躺到地板上的人。它的缺点是白天不能放在一边。</p><p> The Japanese use a tatami mat under the futon. This provides ventilation underneath which helps regulate body temperature as well as keep the futon from becoming damp with the body’s persperation. It also keeps the futon, blanets, and pillows off the floor which might be dirty and drafty. This is a great invention, but is expensive and doesn’t always fit in with a person’s interior design. A simple tatami mat imitation can be easily handmade from lumber. All that is needed is a slatted surface raised a few inches off the floor. Or the platform bed can serve as a tatami mat if it has a slatted surface.</p><p>日本人在蒲团下面用榻榻米垫。这为床底提供了通风，有助于调节体温，并防止蒲团随着身体的运转而受潮。它还能让被子、布袋和枕头远离地板，因为地板可能又脏又通风。这是一项伟大的发明，但价格昂贵，并不总是适合一个人的室内设计。一个简单的榻榻米垫仿制品可以很容易地用木材手工制作。所需要的只是一个板条表面，离地面几英寸。或者，如果平台床的表面有条板，它也可以用作榻榻米垫。</p><p> People with health issues such as arthritis, scoliosis, rheumatism, or weak capillaries will need to use common sense and not go to as hard a surface as healthier individuals.  What you are aiming for is a ‘spine-neutral’ position. Neutral spine is the natural position of the spine when all 3 curves of the spine — cervical (neck), thoracic (middle) and lumbar (lower) — are present and in good alignment.</p><p>患有关节炎、脊柱侧凸、风湿病或毛细血管虚弱等健康问题的人需要运用常识，而不是像健康的人那样走到坚硬的表面。你的目标是“脊柱中立”的姿势。中立脊柱是脊柱的自然位置，当颈椎（颈部）、胸椎（中部）和腰椎（下部）的所有三条曲线都存在并处于良好的对齐状态时。</p><p> The type of comfort one feels on a hard surface is more of an acquired taste. It is similar to the difference between Wonder Bread and old fashioned sourdough bread. One is soft and empty, one is solid and wholesome. You will feel your hips and shoulders rubbing against the surface and you won’t sink in as before. Unfamiliarity is not comfortable. It is comforting in the way it helps you breathe more fully, the way it grounds your body, the way it reassures you that there is something solid somewhere in life that you can always count on.</p><p>在坚硬的表面上感觉到的舒适感更多的是后天获得的味道。这类似于神奇面包和老式酸面包之间的区别。一个是柔软而空虚的，一个是坚实而有益健康的。你会感觉到你的臀部和肩膀在表面摩擦，你不会像以前那样陷进去。不熟悉是不舒服的。它帮助你更充分地呼吸，让你的身体更稳定，让你确信生活中总有一些坚实的东西可以依靠，这是一种安慰。</p><p> At first you may feel like it’s impossible to relax, because it contradicts all your ideas about relaxation. You are feeling your life energy, the place your body comes up against the earth. You will know where you are out of alignment. Give it some time. Common sense and a spirit of adventure go a long way.</p><p>一开始你可能会觉得放松是不可能的，因为这与你所有关于放松的想法相矛盾。你正在感受你的生命能量，你的身体与地球接触的地方。你会知道你偏离了方向。给点时间。常识和冒险精神很重要。</p><p> Sleeping in this way resembles restorative yoga, and props can be used in much the same way. The goal is to position the body so it is relaxed and comfortable. There are several supports, bolsters, and pillows which can be propped in any number of ways depending on individual needs.  For instance, for lower back pain, place a small support under the lower back (when lying on your back). A rolled up sock will work, but a flax seed eye pillow is the ultimate size and shapes just the right amount. Or alternatively, place a bolster behind the knees.</p><p>以这种方式睡觉类似于恢复性瑜伽，道具的使用方式也大致相同。目标是使身体处于放松和舒适的位置。有几种支架、靠垫和枕头，可以根据个人需要以多种方式支撑。例如，对于下背部疼痛，在下背部下方放置一个小支架（仰卧时）。卷起来的袜子可以，但是亚麻籽眼枕的尺寸和形状都非常合适。或者，在膝盖后面放一个靠垫。</p><p> When side sleeping, hug a large pillow and put a pillow between your knees–or use a body pillow. Also, make sure your head pillow is tall enough. It should be about 5 inches (for most people) when compressed–your head should not be pushed up or down but paralell with the bed.</p><p>侧睡时，抱住一个大枕头，在膝盖之间放一个枕头——或者用一个身体枕头。另外，确保你的头枕足够高。当你的头被压缩时，它应该是5英寸（对于大多数人来说）——你的头不应该被推上或推下，而是与床平行。</p><p>  1–The perceived comfort is an adaptive response. The body becomes ‘front-loaded’ due to facters such as chair sitting and mattresses. When the body stretches and lengthens on a firm surface, those tight muscles and ligaments are stretched and noticed, causing discomfort.</p><p>1–感知舒适度是一种适应性反应。由于坐椅和床垫等因素，身体变得“前倾”。当身体在坚硬的表面上伸展和拉长时，这些紧绷的肌肉和韧带会被拉伸和注意到，导致不适。</p><p> 2–The psychosomatic aspect of a mattress: It looks thick and plush, therefore it MUST be comfortable.</p><p>2–床垫的身心方面：它看起来又厚又柔软，因此一定很舒适。</p><p> 3–Since mattresses have been around for so long, no-one even questions their usefulness. Therefore no studies are performed.</p><p>3–由于床垫已经存在了这么久，没有人质疑它们的实用性。因此没有进行任何研究。</p><p> 4–The propaganda of a century of advertising.  In reality that mattress is creating and/or masking the body’s current structural imbalances, impeding circulation and hampering the body from realigning itself during sleep. Sleeping on a hard surface can reshape the back and realign the body. A firm slee</p><p>4–一个世纪的广告宣传。事实上，床垫正在制造和/或掩盖身体当前的结构失衡，阻碍循环，阻碍身体在睡眠中自我调整。在坚硬的地面上睡觉可以重塑背部，重新调整身体。结实的雨衣</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/睡眠/">#睡眠</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/dreams/">#dreams</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
