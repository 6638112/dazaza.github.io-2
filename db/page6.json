A customer used their support contract to ask   how to change among the three levels of play in Space Cadet Pinball. My proudest achievement of Windows XP was   fixing the game so it didn\u2019t consume 100% CPU. People keep asking   if it can be brought back.\n One point of contention is over my claim that   I removed Pinball from Windows because I couldn\u2019t get the 64-bit version to work. Retrocomputing enthusiast   NCommander even undertook a   Zapruder-level analysis of all of the 64-bit versions of Windows he could find to prove or disprove my story.\n I was amazed at the level of thoroughness (and the fortitude it required to get those Itanium systems up and running, much less debug them), but there\u2019s one version of 64-bit Windows that NCommander didn\u2019t try out, and that\u2019s the one that\u2019s relevant to the story.\n When the 64-bit Windows project started, there was no Itanium hardware yet. The only way you could run any Itanium code was to run it in a simulator. Booting Windows on an Itanium simulator took forever. Clearly not the development environment you wanted when porting millions of lines of code.\n On the other hand, the Windows team did have access to a lot of copies of another 64-bit processor: The Alpha AXP.\n In 1999, Compaq announced that   it would no longer support Windows on the Alpha AXP, which left a lot of Windows team members with cumbersome paperweights on their desks.\n  \n The Alpha AXP is internally a 64-bit processor. It\u2019s just that 32-bit Windows used only the 32-bit subset.\n  Now, 64-bit Windows on the Alpha AXP would never ship. But the Alpha AXP did have the advantage of  existing in physical form, so the system could finish booting before the heat death of the universe. The assumption is that most of the effort in porting Windows to the Itanium is in the 32-bit to 64-bit transition, and not in dealing with quirks of the specific 64-bit processor you are porting to.\n The assumption was somewhat validated by experience: The 32-bit Windows code base had been ported to many 32-bit processors, with relatively few architecture-specific issues. Once you got a 64-bit version of Windows working for the Alpha AXP, it should be a comparatively small amount of additional work to port it to Itanium. The hard part was going from 32-bit to 64-bit.\n The team set to work, and we had 64-bit Windows running on physical Alpha AXP hardware long before we had any physical Itanium hardware. I could test my 64-bit port on a physical Alpha AXP system to validate that it was successful. And that\u2019s the system that had the broken collision detector.\n NCommander did find a collision detection bug on the Itanium, although that bug was nowhere as severe as the one that existed on the Alpha AXP. My guess is that it had to do with the default rounding mode established by the C runtime library.\n My theory as to what happened is that some time after I removed Pinball from the product, the C runtime team realized that they had a compatibility bug in the way they set the default rounding mode, and they fixed it. Or maybe there was a compiler bug, and the compiler team fixed that. Whatever the problem was, somebody fixed it, and then they went back and re-tested Pinball with this fix, and everything worked great, so they put Pinball back.\n I\u2019m just guessing about what happened afterward because nobody informed me that they had gotten Pinball working and added it back. I just assumed that it was gone forever.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 03:25:42", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "windows,\u7a7a\u95f4,gaps,cadet", "title": "\u572864\u4f4d\u7a97\u53e3\u4e0a\u586b\u5145\u7a7a\u95f4Cadet Pinball\u6545\u4e8b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u7a7a\u767d", "title_en": "Filling in some gaps in the story of Space Cadet Pinball on 64-bit Windows", "transed": 1, "url": "https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20220106-00/?p=106122", "via": "", "real_tags": ["windows", "\u7a7a\u95f4", "gaps", "cadet"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "2f96b034c675a9ba40e7c30ea4bd03d5.png", "infoid": 1072544, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u987e\u540d\u601d\u4e49\uff0c\u7535\u6e90\u8fdc\u7a0b\u684c\u9762\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u4ee5PowerShell\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u8fdc\u7a0b\u684c\u9762\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\n\u6211\u8fd8\u5c06\u63d0\u9ad8\u6ce8\u91ca\u548c\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08\u8be6\u7ec6/\u6b63\u5e38\u6587\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c1d\u8bd5\u652f\u6301\u5149\u6807\u72b6\u6001\u76d1\u89c6\u5668\uff08\u5728\u67e5\u770b\u5668\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5149\u6807\u72b6\u6001\uff09\u3002\n\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u5c3d\u529b\u51c6\u5907\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cPhrozen Sasu\u4e0d\u80fd\u4e0d\u8bb2\u8fc7\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0cPhrozen SASU\u4e0d\u5f97\u8d23\u4efb\u4efb\u4f55\u635f\u5931\u548c/\u6216\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6709\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "note_en": "As the name suggests, Power Remote Desktop is a Remote Desktop application entirely coded in PowerShell.\n It does not rely in any existing remote desktop application / protocol to function.

This change allowed us to do a major code cleanup and migrate to some newer methods in different areas which are only available on Buster and above.\n Debian 9 \u201cStretch\u201d was released in 2017, and it has been initially superseded by Debian 10 \u201cBuster\u201d, and then Debian 11 \u201cBullseye\u201d.\n DietPi v7.9 was the last release with support for Debian Stretch.  DietPi v8.0 and later require Debian Buster or newer.\n Read our article   Why you should upgrade your Stretch system now to learn more about the need to make this upgrade and you could do this easily to Debian Buster and even further to latest version ( Debian Bullseye).\n  Network    For new images, the default DHCP timeout is not reduced to 10 seconds anymore. This could have been too short, in which case network targets of the boot sequence are reached before an IP has been actually assigned. Especially in case of  AUTO_SETUP_AUTOMATED=1 this could have lead to connection test timeouts and hence abortion of the automated first run setup. Many thanks to  @jpeg2600 for reporting such a case:  MichaIng/DietPi#5143\n DietPi-Config    When configuring a first WiFi slot via scanning for SSIDs, the WiFi adapter is now not brought up via  ifup but  ip l dev wlanX up. This way no DHCP and WPA client starts are triggered, which are doomed to fail when the WiFi adapter is not connected to any access point yet. Especially in case of the default 60 seconds DHCP timeout, this would otherwise cause an unnecessary long delay.\n DietPi-Dashboard    Added an option to view multiple dashboard nodes from one frontend web interface. Related to this, the backend can now be installed only, reducing memory usage and making it impossible to manually access the node outside of the backend API.\n DietPi-Print_large    This new script has been added which can be executed or sourced from  /boot/dietpi/func/dietpi-print_large to print the string passed via first argument in large  figlet style fonts. It currently only supports the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, dot and dash, i.e. those commonly allowed in hostnames.\n DietPi-Banner    Added an option to print the system\u2019s hostname in large  figlet style fonts, right below the banner header. In case it is enabled as well, the regular/small hostname line will then be skipped. Many thanks to  @matellis for implementing this feature:\n DietPi-Software |  Mono    mono-complete won\u2019t be installed anymore but only  mono-devel instead. This skips the  XSP4 webserver service, which listens on port 8084 by default where it conflicts with File Browser. This only affects new installations. You can manually apply this change running next command:\n DietPi-Software |   FuguHub    The outdated official installer has been replaced with a fully automated own setup, removing the obsolete or even harmful interactive dialogues. On fresh installs, an admin account  dietpi with global software password is created as well.\n DietPi-Software |   myMPD    Installation is now done via official APT repository, which means quicker install compared to compiling from source, fewer dependencies and easier updates via  apt upgrade:  MichaIng/DietPi#5115\n DietPi-Software |   Airsonic    Since the project has been archived by its maintainer and suffers from the critical  Log4Shell security vulnerability, we moved to the advertised fork \u201cAirsonic-Advanced\u201d which also enables compatibility with Java 17 and hence Debian Bullseye. Airsonic will be reinstalled as part of the DietPi update to apply the migration. All data and settings will be preserved and migrated automatically.\n DietPi images |   Parallels Desktop (macOS)    New Virtual Machine image for Parallels Desktop on macOS.\n  Raspberry Pi    Resolved an issue where unintentionally the turbo mode was enabled. This got backported to v7.9, to our existing RPi images and via live patch. Many thanks to  @ayo-x and  @whyisthisbroken for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5088\n DietPi-FS_partition_resize    Resolved an issue where in some cases the boot partition failed to mount on first boot since after the partition resize the system in some cases didn\u2019t get sufficient time to fully apply the change before continuing with the boot mount attempt. Many thanks to  @Mausy5043 and  @sistemicorp for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5006\n DietPi-Config    Resolved an issue where on Raspberry Pi, when the full KMS display driver is used, the sound card selection could have been falsely applied. With full KMS enabled, for each HDMI port an additional HDMI sound card appears (replacing the regular firmware HDMI sound device), even when no HDMI device is attached and with onboard audio disabled. This lead to an increase of external sound card indices. The appearance of the KMS HDMI sound cards is now aligned with the onboard firmware HDMI sound cards, i.e. if not onboard  auto or HDMI is selected in  dietpi-config, now the KMS HDMI sound devices are disabled as well, making use of the  noaudio device tree overlay parameter.\n DietPi-Software Resolved an issue where on first boot, choice and preference menu selections triggered an error as the install state file did not exist yet. Many thanks to  @bsheeres for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5080\n Resolved an issue where the deprecated  AUTO_SETUP_FILE_SERVER_INDEX option in  dietpi.txt file was applied inverted.  -1 should have installed  ProFTPD and  -2 Samba, while it was done the opposite way. However, note that this setting is not present on current images and deprecated. Use  AUTO_SETUP_INSTALL_SOFTWARE_ID instead to mark any one or multiple file servers for automatic install. Many thanks to  @bsheeres for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5081\n Browsers - On the ARMv6 Raspberry Pi models Raspberry Pi 1 and Zero (1) since Bullseye,  Chromium and  Firefox fail to start due to hardware and build limitations which are outside of our control. Since those are currently the only two browser available from  dietpi-software, they have been disabled together with the browser preference menu for those systems, until we find and implement a good additional compatible browser. Further info:  RPi-Distro/chromium-browser#21.\n DietPi-Software |   Kodi    Resolved an issue where subsequent Kodi reinstalls created duplicates of the  CMA parameter for the KMS overlay setting in  config.txt. The duplicates are patched out during DietPi update.\n DietPi-Software |   Docker    Resolved an issue where the install was aborted due to an incorrect check for missing kernel modules. Many thanks to  @dragonandy for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5061\n DietPi-Software |   Pi-hole    Resolved an issue where the teleporter import log was not shown but denied by the X-Frame-Options header:  https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/unable-to-restore-teleporter-backup-fresh-install-no-funky-changes-made/51573\n DietPi-Software |   Blynk Server    Resolved an issue on ARMv6 RPi models where the install failed as the latest Blynk Server release does not contain a Java 8 build. Since the older Java 8 build does not contain a native Log4Shell vulnerability mitigation, it is added server-wise on these systems.\n DietPi-Software |   Mycroft AI    Resolved an issue on Bullseye (and above) systems where  mycroft-cli-client command fails with a permissions issue, even as root user.

Many thanks to  @kd9352 for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5058\n DietPi-Software |   myMPD    Resolved an issue where the installation failed due to an updated dependency. Many thanks to  @supersexy for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5115\n DietPi-Software |   Python 3    Worked around an issue where the  pip reinstall failed. Many thanks to  @hueppinr for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5117\n DietPi-Software |   Unbound    Resolved an issue where the  unbound-resolvconf service applied localhost automatically as local name server, if the  resolvconf package was installed. Since often Unbound is installed in combination with Pi-hole or AdGuard Home, and those are usually used by network clients only, not the server itself,  unbound-resolvconf is disabled now on Unbound installs. If Unbound is wanted as local resolver as well, it should be explicitly configured, e.g. via dietpi-config network options.

But the USPTO has maintained that \u201cspectacles\u201d is a generic term for smart glasses and that Snap\u2019s version \u201chas not acquired distinctiveness,\u201d as required for a trademark.\n In its complaint filed Wednesday in US District Court in California, Snap claims that the Spectacles name \u201cevokes an incongruity between an 18th century term for corrective eyewear and Snap\u2019s high-tech 21st century smart glasses. SPECTACLES also is suggestive of the camera\u2019s purpose, to capture and share unusual, notable, or entertaining scenes (i.e., \u201cspectacles\u201d) and while also encouraging users to make \u2018spectacles\u2019 of themselves.\u201d\n Snap first introduced its camera-equipped Spectacles in 2016 (\u201ca wearable digital video camera housed in a pair of fashionable sunglasses,\u201d according to its complaint), which can take photos and videos while the user wears them and connects with the Snap smartphone app. Despite selling them both online and in pop-up vending machines around the world, the first iteration of Spectacles mostly flopped with consumers. In its 2017 third-quarter earnings report,  Snap said it had lost nearly $40 million on some 300,000 unsold Spectacles.\n In May 2021,  Snap CEO Evan Spiegel showed off an augmented reality ver sion of the Spectacles, which so far are available only to a small group of creators and reviewers chosen by the company. The  AR Spectacles aren\u2019t yet available for purchase by the general public.\n  Snap\u2019s new complaint posits that there\u2019s been enough media coverage of Spectacles, bolstered by some industry awards and its own marketing including social media, to support its claim that consumers associate the word \u201cspectacles\u201d with the Snap brand. Snap first filed a trademark application for Spectacles in September 2016, \u201cfor use in connection with wearable computer hardware\u201d and other related uses \u201camong consumer electronics devices and displays.\u201d\n During several rounds of back-and-forth with the company since then, the USPTO has maintained that the word \u201cspectacles\u201d appeared to be \u201cgeneric in connection with the identified goods,\u201d i.e. the camera glasses. Snap continued to appeal the agency\u2019s decision.\n In a  November 2021 opinion, the USPTO\u2019s Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (pdf) upheld the decision, reiterating that the word \u201cspectacles\u201d was a generic term that applied to all smart glasses, not just Snap\u2019s version. Despite the publicity Snap claimed its Spectacles had received from its marketing and social media, the board noted in its opinion that Spectacles\u2019 \u201csocial media accounts have an underwhelming number of followers, and the number of followers is surprisingly small,\u201d which didn\u2019t support the company\u2019s argument that there had been a high enough level of consumer exposure to Snap\u2019s Spectacles to claim that consumers associated the word with Snap\u2019s brand.\n In its Tuesday complaint, Snap\u2019s attorneys argued that \u201cspectacles is an old-fashioned term popular in the 18th century,\u201d and that it \u201cis not often used today in the United States,\u201d especially by Snapchat\u2019s young audience. \u201cThis indicates that modern-day usage of \u201cspectacles\u201d in the United States\u2014especially among a younger demographic of consumers who are the relevant consumers of Snap\u2019s SPECTACLES camera product\u2014is not commonly understood to mean eyeglasses, and certainly not a wireless-enabled video camera product.\u201d\n But the USPTO appeal board said in November that the evidence didn\u2019t support that argument, and that the word \u201cspectacles\u201d still retains its generic meaning and therefore can\u2019t be trademarked. The board noted that in its own marketing, Snap had demonstrated that its Spectacles \u201ceyeglasses form is a feature, function and characteristic of the camera, not only functionally but aesthetically.\u201d\n Snap\u2019s lawsuit, which names acting USPTO director Drew Hirshfeld, seeks to have the appeal board\u2019s November decision reversed.

And now at least one splinter group is arguing that the entire project should be decentralized, potentially an industry first.\n Launched in July,  Pudgy Penguins has become one of the most successful NFT projects, raking in over  45,400 ETH in sales on NFT marketplace OpenSea. (That works out to about $140 million in today\u2019s ether ( ETH) prices.) NFT stands for \u201c non-fungible tokens,\u201d a subcategory of cryptocurrencies that represents ownership in a unique asset, from art to real estate.\n The collection of 8,888 chubby and flightless Antarctic creatures \u2013 donning accessories such as baseball caps and fishing rods \u2013 were available to mint last July for 0.03 ETH and sold out in less than 20 minutes.\n  According to Twitter user and Pudgy Penguins owner  @9x9x9eth, Pudgy Penguins co-founder  Cole Thereum \u201cpromised a game, a token, an educational book on NFTs and more\u201d to the community last September.\n \u201cAfter a half year, they still have not yet set up the team, they are still in the stage of hiring,\u201d 9x9x9 told CoinDesk via Twitter.\n (9x9x9 publicly stated he has spent nearly 600 ETH on the collection and holds 242 Pudgy Penguins NFTs and one rare \u201cbanana\u201d penguin, purchased for 100 ETH.)\n Pudgy Penguins pseudonymous co-founders Cole Thereum and Twitter user  @tubbyfat didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment via Twitter direct message.\n  On Wednesday evening, 9x9x9 published  a Twitter thread claiming the Pudgy Penguins founders were looking to abandon the project and offered to sell him its shell for 888 ETH (about $2.8 million), an offer he turned down.\n Since the tweets,  the floor price of a Pudgy Penguin shot up from about 0.6 ETH ($1,860) on Wednesday evening to 1.7 ETH ($5,270) as of press time.\n Now, the project has received buyout offers as high as 750 ETH ($2.3 million) from other prominent individuals in the NFT market, including  Mintable co-founder  Zach Burks, NFT collector  @beaniemax and  Netz Capital\u2019s  Luca Netz.\n    Others in the community are more wary of a buyout. NFT hedge fund  Starry Night Capital\u2019s  @Vince_Van_Dough and  eGirl Capital\u2019s  @loomdart \u2013 other prominent stakeholders in the project \u2013 have floated the idea of migrating the community to a new project called  Wrapped Penguins.\n  The Pudgy Penguins founding team receives a small percentage in royalties from each NFT sale, meaning founders of successful projects can continue to line their pockets as long as trading volume persists.\n Wrapped Penguins,  available as a free mint on NFT platform  Metadrop for current Penguin holders, would sever all ties with the original founding team with the new project in the hope of creating a parallel community that would be governed using a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) framework.\n A wrapper is a  smart contract that takes an asset and issues a parallel asset, allowing the Pudgy Penguins NFT holder to hold an identical \u201cwrapped\u201d penguin.

If you intend to use an EV to reduce carbon emissions from oil, you don\u2019t have to wait until you own one. If you already own one, you can further reduce your footprint. Let\u2019s find out.\n Transport, by far, is one of the largest sectors contributing to CO2 emissions. The time it takes for the oil to burn and pollute is short in this sector. And we burn it in our towns and cities where we live. This is easy to see and experience. Hence the immediate concern.\n  Bu  t what we don\u2019t see is how we unconsciously consume everyday products made out of materials derived from petroleum. While they may not immediately release emissions as vehicles do, they still contribute to our carbon footprint every single day.\n Perhaps oil is one of the most efficiently refined resources. With the current demand, a barrel of oil produces more than just fuel. Mass adoption of EVs could change that. But how about the products made from petroleum?\n  There are over 6,000 products made from petroleum. The tires, bodywork, and the dashboard of an electric vehicle use materials made from petroleum products. Some of the sophisticated healthcare equipment use materials made from petroleum. Our modern lives depend on them.\n Chances are you are currently wearing clothes that are made from petroleum products. Just take a look around and you will see they are everywhere. It is virtually impossible to avoid using them all.\n  Trash, a lot of trash! Once these products reach the end of their lifetime (often barely used), they end up in landfills and in places where they shouldn\u2019t \u2014 rivers, ocean, soil.\n Single-use plastic is the major contributor. Plastic is notoriously difficult to recycle. Of all the plastic ever produced, only 9% is recycled. The majority of the plastic waste is sent to landfills and the ocean and thus killing sea life. Say no to single-use plastic.\n  Synthetic clothes made from polyester, polyacryl, etc., shed microfibre particles on each wash. These particles reach the waterbody and enter our food chain through crop absorption and seafood. And let\u2019s not forget, they do kill marine life.\n  Teabags can release microplastic particles in your cup of tea, as many as 11.6 billion of them, and you know where they go! Instead, loose tea leaf and metallic infusers could be your best bet. Bonus \u2014 you also reduce the trash created by teabags.\n Personal care products such as face wash, toothpaste, etc., containing solid plastic microbead particles enter the waterbody and end up on your plate. Several countries have banned the use of microbeads for good!\n  And the list goes on! Often the petroleum products having shorter shelf life are a matter of concern. That said, we cannot deny the positive uses of some of the products based on petroleum. A few have saved lives! It is about finding the right balance.\n By now, you must have also thought about public transport and ridesharing to reduce the carbon footprint. How is this related to EVs? I wanted to use EV as a segue to bring this topic since it is closer to our efforts to reduce the use of oil, directly and indirectly.\n We need to make conscious decisions before the next purchase. Or better ask ourselves, do we really need them? Can we reuse, repair or upcycle? The media and society around us hide the truth and force us to make bad choices. Being a conscious consumer is not easy, but we can try.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 02:20:14", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "ev,\u5851\u6599", "title": "\u60a8\u4e0d\u9700\u8981EV\u6765\u4ece\u77f3\u6cb9\u4e2d\u524a\u51cf\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u91cf", "title_en": "You don't need an EV to cut your carbon emissions from oil", "transed": 1, "url": "https://santhoshsundar.medium.com/conscious-consumerism-petroleum-770fa288a4a0", "via": "", "real_tags": ["ev", "\u5851\u6599"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072537, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528Disqus\u53d1\u8868\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7sacha@sachachua.com\u53d1\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u7ed9\u6211\u3002", "note_en": "You can comment with Disqus or you can  e-mail me at sacha@sachachua.com.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 02:18:43", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "emacs,\u53d1\u8868", "title": "2022-01-03 Emacs\u65b0\u95fb", "title_en": "2022-01-03 Emacs News", "transed": 1, "url": "https://sachachua.com/blog/2022/01/2022-01-03-emacs-news/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["emacs", "\u53d1\u8868"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "0c5f5d8ed032a36eb718ae7e24c41085.jpg", "infoid": 1072536, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u661f\u671f\u4e8c\u665a\u4e0a\u53d1\u8868\u7684\u4e00\u9879\u5f00\u521b\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u516c\u53f8Zecops\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u963b\u6b62\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6a21\u62dfIOS\u91cd\u542f\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4ed6\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5bf9\u53ef\u80fd\u60f3\u8981\u6b3a\u9a97\u7528\u6237\u601d\u8003\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u6765\u8bf4\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u7528\u7684\u6280\u672f\u91cd\u65b0\u542f\u52a8\u5176\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8bf7\u5728\u8be5\u611f\u67d3\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7ef4\u62a4\u5176\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u6743\u9650\u3002\n\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u79f0\u4e4b\u4e3aNooreboot\uff0c\u5373\u5c06\u5230\u8df3\u677f\uff08Apple iOS UI App\uff0cAKA\u4e3b\u5c4f\u5e55\uff09\u548c\u7bee\u677f\uff08\u8df3\u677f\u540e\u9762\u7684\u5b88\u62a4\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u62bd\u5934\u548c\u62e6\u622a\u624b\u673a\u91cd\u542f\u547d\u4ee4\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u6309\u4e0b\u97f3\u91cf+\u7535\u6e90\u6309\u94ae\uff09\u7136\u540e\u7981\u7528\u8df3\u677fUI\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5173\u95ed\u6574\u4e2a\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\n\u7531\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5236\u91cd\u542f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b21\u5feb\u901f\u6309\u4e0b\u97f3\u91cf\u548c\u97f3\u91cf\u6309\u94ae\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u957f\u6309\u7535\u6e90\u6309\u94ae\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u89c2\u770b\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5236\u91cd\u542f\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u5b8c\u6210\u4e4b\u524d\u963b\u6b62\u5b83\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6267\u884cnooreboot\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "note_en": "In a piece of groundbreaking research published on Tuesday night, security firm ZecOps said that it found a way to block and then simulate an iOS restart operation, a technique that they believe could be extremely useful to attackers who may want to trick users into thinking they rebooted their device and as a result, maintain access for their malware on that infected system.\n The technique is of extreme importance and gravity because of the way the iPhone malware landscape has evolved in recent years, where, due to advances in the security of the iOS operating system, malware can\u2019t achieve boot persistence as easily as it once did.\n Because of this, today, most iOS malware strains focus on infecting a device, gaining root access, and harvesting and spying on the user until victims restart their iPhones and iPads, after which the attacker tries to infect the victim again.\n As a result, many security experts have recommended over the past year that users who might be the target of malicious threat actors regularly reboot devices in order to remove backdoors or other implants.\n And some more generic iOS security tips: reboot your device daily, to remove non-persistent implants. Create regular iTunes backups, to check them later for signs of compromise. Trigger sysdiags regularly and save them.\n\u2014 Costin Raiu (@craiu)  September 14, 2021\n   But in a\u00a0 blog post\u00a0on Tuesday, ZecOps said that the iOS restart process isn\u2019t immune to being hijacked once an attacker has gained access to a device.\n The researchers said they developed a technique they called\u00a0 NoReboot\u00a0that taps into\u00a0 SpringBoard\u00a0(the Apple iOS UI app, aka the Home Screen) and\u00a0 Backboardd\u00a0(the daemon behind SpringBoard) to detect and intercept a phone restart command (such as pressing the Volume Down + Power buttons) and then disabling the SpringBoard UI instead of shutting down the entire OS.\n This effectively leaves the iPhone screen with no UI, mimicking the state a device is usually in when it is turned off.\n However, the device is still powered on, but without a user interface. To prevent the device from ringing or vibrating, ZecOps said its\u00a0 NoReboot proof-of-concept code\u00a0also disables features such as 3D Touch feedback, camera LED indicators, and vibration and sound for any incoming calls or notifications.\n The proof-of-concept code also includes a fake boot-up screen to complete the illusion of a full iOS reboot.\n  ZecOps said the NoReboot technique works with regular restarts but does not work with\u00a0 forced restarts, which take place at a hardware level, rather than software.\n \u201cWe have not found an easy way to hijack the force restart event. This event is implemented at a much lower level,\u201d ZecOps researchers said.\n However, ZecOps researchers warn that this does not mean users should believe they are safe if they perform a forced restart.\n Because the forced restart event requires users to rapidly press the Volume Up and Volume Down buttons multiple times and then long-press the Power Button, an attacker could watch for a pattern that resembles a forced restart, block it before it finishes, and then perform the NoReboot attack instead.\n The discovery and revelation of the new NoReboot attack highlights that users should not solely rely on iOS reboots to remove malware from their device but should primarily rely on classic security apps and forensics tools to identify and remove such threats instead.\n At the time of writing, no iOS malware has been seen or publicly documented using a trick resembling NoReboot.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 01:27:04", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8f6f\u4ef6,ios,iphone,\u6f14\u5458,actors", "title": "\u5a01\u80c1\u6f14\u5458\u53ef\u4ee5\u6a21\u62dfiPhone\u91cd\u65b0\u542f\u52a8\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684iOS\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6", "title_en": " Threat Actors Can Simulate IPhone Reboots and Keep IOS Malware On a Device", "transed": 1, "url": "https://therecord.media/threat-actors-can-simulate-iphone-reboots-and-keep-ios-malware-on-a-device/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8f6f\u4ef6", "ios", "iphone", "\u6f14\u5458", "actors"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072535, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Saola\u662f\u5982\u6b64\u96be\u4ee5\u6349\u6478\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u91ce\u5916\u6ca1\u6709\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5bb6\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u5b83\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4ed6\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fdd\u5b58\u5b83\n\u5c3d\u7ba1\u52aa\u529b\u6539\u5584\u5b89\u7eb3\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5c71\u8109\u81ea\u7136\u4fdd\u62a4\u533a\u7684\u5de1\u903b\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4e00\u5bb6\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u5c71\u8109\u901a\u8fc7\u8001\u631d\uff0c\u8d8a\u5357\u548c\u4e1c\u5317\u67ec\u57d4\u5be8\u5ef6\u4f38\u7ea6680\u82f1\u91cc\uff0c\u5077\u730e\u4e00\u76f4\u5f3a\u70c8\u3002 \u201c\u6210\u5343\u4e0a\u4e07\u7684\u4eba\u4f7f\u7528\u9677\u9631\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u68ee\u6797\u91cc\u6709\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u4eba\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5927\u578b\u54fa\u4e73\u52a8\u7269\u7684\u79cd\u7fa4\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u9e1f\u7c7b\u6ca1\u6709\u529e\u6cd5\u9003\u907f\u5e76\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u5b89\u5229\u4e9a\u7279\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u201d\u79d1\u7f57\u62c9\u591a\u5dde\u7acb\u5927\u5b66\u7684\u535a\u58eb\u5b66\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e16\u536b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7814\u7a76\u9677\u9631\u5bf9\u5371\u53ca\u5371\u5bb3\u5927\u578b\u9e7f\u8338\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\n\u5982\u679c\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u7684Saolas\u5c06\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u7531SWG\u548c\u8d8a\u5357\u653f\u5e9c\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u4fd8\u864f\u80b2\u79cd\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u5728\u8d8a\u5357\u4e2d\u90e8B\u1ea1chm\u00c3\u56fd\u5bb6\u516c\u56ed\u3002", "note_en": "The saola is so elusive that no biologist has seen one in the wild. Now they are racing to find it, so they can save it\n    W eighing 80-100kg and sporting long straight horns, white spots on its face and large facial scent glands, the saola does not sound like an animal that would be hard to spot. But it was not until  1992 that this elusive creature was discovered, becoming the first large mammal new to science in more than 50 years.\n Nicknamed the \u201cAsian unicorn\u201d, the saola continues to be elusive. They have never been seen by a biologist in the wild and have been camera-trapped only  a handful of times. There are reports of villagers trying to keep them in captivity but they have died after a few weeks, probably due to the wrong diet.\n  It was during a survey of wildlife in the remote V\u0169 Quang nature reserve, a 212 square mile forested area of north central  Vietnam, in 1992, that biologist Do Tuoc came across two skulls and a pair of trophy horns belonging to an unknown animal.\n Twenty more specimens, including a complete skin, were subsequently collected and, in 1993, laboratory tests revealed the animal to be not only a new species, but an entirely new genus in the bovid family, which includes cattle, sheep, goats and antelopes.\n Initially named Vu Quang Ox, the animal was later called saola ( Pseudoryx  nghetinhensis) \u2013 meaning \u201cspindle horns\u201d, the arms or posts (sao) of a spinning wheel (la) according to Lao-speaking ethnic groups in  Laos and neighbouring Vietnam.\n  The discovery was hailed as one of the most spectacular zoological discoveries of the 20th century but  less than 30 years later the saola population is believed to have declined massively due to commercial wildlife poaching, which  has exploded in Vietnam since 1994. Even though the saola is not directly targeted by poachers, intensive commercial snaring that supplies animals for use in traditional Asian medicine or as bushmeat serves as the primary threat.\n  Despite efforts to improve patrolling of nature reserves in the Annamite mountains, a major mountain range extending about 680 miles through Laos, Vietnam and into north-east Cambodia, poaching has been intensifying. \u201cThousands of people use snares, so there are millions of them in the forest, which means populations of large mammals and some birds have no way to escape and are collapsing throughout the Annamites,\u201d says Minh Nguyen, a PhD student at Colorado State University, who studies the impact of snares on critically endangered large-antlered muntjac.\n In 2001, the saola population was estimated to number 70 to 700 in Laos and several hundred in Vietnam. More recently, experts have put the number at  fewer than 100 \u2013 a decline that led to the species being listed as critically endangered on the IUCN red list in 2006, the highest risk category that a species can have before extinction in the wild. The animal was  last camera-trapped in 2013 in the Saola Nature Reserve in central Vietnam. Since then, villagers continue to report its presence in areas in and around Pu Mat national park in Vietnam and in Bolikhamxay province in Laos.\n We stand at a moment of conservation history. We know how to find and save this magnificent animal. We just need the world to come together\n In 2006, William Robichaud and Simon Hedges, a biologist and specialist on wildlife conservation and countering the illegal wildlife trade in Asia and Africa, co-founded the  Saola Working Group (SWG) with the aim of finding the last saolas in the wild for a captive breeding programme, in order to reintroduce the species back into the wild in future, in a natural habitat that is free from threats.\n The SWG connects conservation organisations in Laos and Vietnam to raise awareness, collect information from local people, and search for saola. But the animals continue to elude the team. Between 2017 and 2019, the SWG carried out an intensive search using 300 camera traps in an 11 square mile area of the Khoun Xe Nongma national protected area in Laos. Not one of the million photographs captured saola.\n According to the IUCN,  only about 30% of potential Saola habitat has had any form of wildlife survey and potentially as little as 2% has been searched intensively for the species. Technologies limit the capabilities \u2013 camera traps are not good at detecting individual animals that are spread across a large area, especially in the damp, dense forest of the saola range. In August this year, the IUCN Species Survival Commission called for more investment in the search for the saola. \u201cIt is clear that search efforts must be significantly ramped up in scale and intensity if we are to save this species from extinction,\u201d said Nerissa Chao, Director of the IUCN SSC Asian Species Action Partnership\n  One organisation,  the Saola Foundation, is raising money for a new initiative that would train dogs to detect saola signs such as dung. Any samples would then be studied onsite using rapid saola-specific DNA field test kits being developed in conjunction with the Wildlife Conservation Society\u2019s Molecular Laboratory in New York. Should the kits return a positive result within an hour, expert wildlife trackers will start searching for saola in the forest.\n If successful, captured saolas will be taken to a captive breeding centre being developed by the SWG and the Vietnamese government at B\u1ea1ch M\u00e3 national park in central Vietnam.\n \u201cWe stand at a moment of conservation history,\u201d says Robichaud, who is president of the Saola Foundation. \u201cWe know how to find and save this magnificent animal, which has been on planet Earth for perhaps 8m years. We just need the world to come together and support the effort. It won\u2019t cost much, and the reward, for saola, for the Annamite mountains, and for ourselves, will be huge.\u201d\n Find more  age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters  Phoebe Weston and  Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features", "posttime": "2022-01-10 01:25:15", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6,\u6293\u4f4f,step,\u9677\u9631", "title": "\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u4eec\u6293\u4f4f\u4e86\u201c\u4e9a\u6d32\u72ec\u89d2\u517d\u201d\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u7a00\u6709\u7684\u52a8\u7269\u4e4b\u4e00", "title_en": "Scientists Step Up Hunt For 'Asian Unicorn,' One of World's Rarest Animals", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/07/scientists-step-up-hunt-for-asian-unicorn-one-of-worlds-rarest-animals-aoe", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6", "\u6293\u4f4f", "step", "\u9677\u9631"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7d79de91228e184b2b1c662f798e5387.jpg", "infoid": 1072534, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u572812\u670821\u65e5\u661f\u671f\u4e8c\u8df3\u5230\u4e3b\u8981\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2aNFT\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u964d\u81f3\u540c\u6837\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u5c31\u50cf\u52a0\u5bc6\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u9879\u76ee\u4e00\u6837\uff0cNFT\u7cfb\u5217\u7334\u5b50\u738b\u56fd\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u5e02\u573a\u5206\u6570\u7ef4\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u548c\u8c10\u7684\u804a\u5929\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0e\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u793e\u533a\u4e00\u8d77\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u90fd\u5373\u5c06\u5411\u5176\u793e\u533a\u6210\u5458\u5206\u53d1\u5956\u52b1\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee4\u724cAirDrop\u768421\u4e16\u7eaa\u548c\u5206\u5f62\u7684NFT\u666e\u96f7\u65af\u7684\u7334\u5b50\u738b\u56fd - \u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u662f\u65e9\u671f\u652f\u6301\u8005\u7684\u514d\u8d39\u5206\u53d1 - \u51e0\u5929\u540e\u3002\n\u201c\u6211\u4eec\u603b\u662f\u52aa\u529b\u4f7f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u66f4\u96be\u53d1\u751f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7ee7\u7eed\u6295\u8d44\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u4fdd\u62a4\u7528\u6237\u201d\n\u8461\u8404\u7f51\u7edc\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u9662\u957f\u5e15\u5e15\u65af\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684\u540c\u4e8b\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u521d\u59cb\u9ed1\u5ba2\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u9996\u5148\u88ab\u5265\u593a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4ee5\u521b\u5efa\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f7f\u7528\u7684Webhooks\u3002 \u201c\u8fd9\u662f\u90a3\u4e9b\u771f\u6b63\u4f24\u5bb3\u4e86\u4f60\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u8005\u90fd\u5728\u9a84\u50b2\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u201dPappas\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5e38\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u201d", "note_en": "Skip to main content                                                                                                                On Tuesday, December 21st, two NFT projects fell victim to the same attack. Like many projects in the crypto world, the NFT collection Monkey Kingdom and in-game asset marketplace Fractal both engaged heavily with their communities through Discord chat servers. Both projects were about to distribute rewards to their community members: Monkey Kingdom through an NFT presale on the day of the 21st and Fractal through a token airdrop \u2014 essentially a free distribution to early supporters \u2014 a few days later.\n Then, disaster struck. Posts appeared in the official \u201cannouncements\u201d channel of each project claiming that a surprise mint would reward community members with a limited edition NFT. Hundreds jumped at the chance \u2014 but for those who followed the links and connected their crypto wallets, a costly surprise was waiting. Rather than receiving an NFT, wallets were being drained of the Solana cryptocurrency, which both projects used for purchases.\n In the space of an hour, a Twitter post, first  from Monkey Kingdom and  then from Fractal, informed followers that their Discord servers had been hacked; news of the NFT mints was bogus, the links a phishing fraud. In the case of Fractal, the scammers  got away with about $150,000 worth of cryptocurrency. For Monkey Kingdom, the estimated total was  reported to be $1.3 million.\n the same techniques that hype up a sale can also open the door to hackers\n Neither attack targeted the blockchain or the tokens themselves. Instead, the thieves exploited weaknesses in the infrastructure used to sell the tokens \u2014 specifically, the Discord chatrooms where NFT fans gather. It\u2019s a reminder of a persistent weakness in the growing NFT economy, where surprise drops have primed buyers to move fast or risk missing out. But the same techniques that hype up a sale can also open the door to hackers \u2014 and in this case, a single compromise can end up spreading to more than one community at once.\n In this case, the NFTs thieves had targeted a feature known as a webhook. Webhooks are used by many web applications (Discord included) to listen for a message sent to a particular URL and trigger an event in response, like posting content to a certain channel. You can think of a webhook like a secret phone number, a unique identifier that can be \u201ccalled\u201d (or, in a closer approximation, \u201ctexted\u201d) to connect to an application on the other end.\n By gaining access to webhooks belonging to the Fractal and Monkey Kingdom Discord servers, the hackers were able to send messages that were broadcast to all members of certain channels: a feature meant to be used only for official communications from the project teams. This was where the fake \u201cannouncement\u201d had come from and why it had pointed to a scam address. In hindsight, the content should have raised some red flags \u2014 but given the distribution method, it looked just legitimate enough that many were fooled.\n \u201cwe are always working to make it harder for these attacks to happen and will continue to invest in education and tools to help protect our users\u201d\n Discord webhooks are used to automate messages based on activities in other applications: for example, the  official documentation describes making a bot that notifies a channel of new GitHub commits. But it\u2019s easy to lose track of those bots amid the various third-party service integrations, and crucially, there\u2019s no way to switch off all of them at once if you\u2019ve been hacked. The result is a major opportunity for attackers and a liability for any Discord communities who aren\u2019t paying attention to their integrations.\n A Discord spokesperson said the company cautioned people to be careful when giving others access to their devices and personal information and pointed to guidance made available through its Moderator Academy  resource center.\n \u201cDiscord takes the safety of all users and communities very seriously, including social engineering attacks like these,\u201d said Peter Day, senior manager of corporate communications at Discord. \u201cWhile there are clear controls in place, we are always working to make it harder for these attacks to happen and will continue to invest in education and tools to help protect our users.\u201d\n \u201cThis is one of those things that really hurts you, both in terms of pride and professionalism\u201d\n The origin of the hack appears to have been a service called Grape Network, which provides community management tools to Fractal, Monkey Kingdom, and hundreds of other crypto projects that used Discord. Roughly a week before the cryptocurrency theft, an employee of Grape Network going by the screen name Arximedis had been caught by a separate scam on another Discord server entirely, this one belonging to Solana.\n By first manipulating a Solana moderator, then Arximedis himself, through a  phishing attack that involves getting the target banned, the hackers had managed to obtain an account access token that let them perform actions on behalf of the Grape administrator. It was enough to let them create an avenue to send messages to the Fractal and Monkey Kingdom Discord channels. With the groundwork in place, the hackers kept quiet and waited for a time to strike.\n Grape Network founder Dean Pappas confirmed to  The Verge that his colleague had been the target of the initial hack and that this first hack had been exploited to create the webhooks that were used in the second. \u201cThis is one of those things that really hurts you, both in terms of pride and professionalism,\u201d Pappas said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult situation.\u201d\n In a statement sent via Twitter, the head of the Monkey Kingdom project (who asked to be referred to by the pseudonym \u201cMonkey King\u201d) said that additional security measures had now been put in place to avoid future attacks and ensure the safety of users. The Monkey King also pointed to the money raised by the project to refund victims of the scam.\n NFT projects are particularly vulnerable to this kind of attack because they move so quickly. Hyped projects often sell out within hours \u2014 or sometimes minutes \u2014 so early adopters are conditioned to act fast. And Discord, now the go-to platform for NFT communities, is where the early intel on presales and airdrops is released first. That means community members are primed to jump on any announcements that give them an edge, which, in turn, lets scammers leverage fake messages to devastating effect.\n  In the most heated drops, making a successful transaction can be difficult even for the early movers.  A Chainalysis examination of one popular project showed that more than 26,000 unsuccessful mint transactions occurred within the first hour after launch, each of which used up nonrefundable transaction fees. All told, more than $4 million was spent on gas fees for unsuccessful transactions.\n There\u2019s no indication yet that the NFT craze will slow in 2022, which means there\u2019ll be no shortage of new projects looking to scale by using off-the-shelf solutions to build their infrastructure. There are signs that Discord, the beating social pulse of the NFT community, is also a goldmine for unscrupulous individuals looking to separate marks from their hard-earned coins \u2014 but perhaps as techniques of moderation and server administration in the community improve, more rigorous management of problem areas (like webhooks and third-party plugins) will reduce risk.\n The good news is that, for the two projects affected by this particular hack, there may be sunnier days ahead. Fractal, the game asset marketplace,  went live on the penultimate day of 2021. And having reimbursed money that was lost by members, Monkey Kingdom is relaunching the NFT line that was interrupted by the hack. The community is loyal, the Monkey King told us, and fans are once again ready to pick up a deal.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 01:24:49", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u9ed1\u5ba2,nft,hacking,\u653b\u51fb", "title": "\u4e0d\u548c\u8c10\u9ed1\u5ba2\u662fNFT\u4e70\u5bb6\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u5a01\u80c1", "title_en": "Discord Hacking is the Newest Threat For NFT Buyers", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/7/22870912/nft-communities-boom-discord-hackers-cryptocurrency-webhooks", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9ed1\u5ba2", "nft", "hacking", "\u653b\u51fb"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e820db917f0e9ee6cec2ad4b899ac5f0.jpg", "infoid": 1072533, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "JALOPNIK\u6536\u4ef6\u7bb1\u5df2\u7ecf\u4eae\u8d77\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u672c\u7530\u6c7d\u8f66\u57282002\u5e74\u7684\u4e00\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5361\u4f4f\u7684\u65f6\u949f\u548c\u65e5\u5386\u7684\u62a5\u544a\u3002\u8513\u5ef6\u4ee4\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u52302004\u5e74\u548c2012\u5e74\u65b0\u7684\u672c\u7530\u548cACURA\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u3002\n\u6211\u4eec\u521a\u6536\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u672c\u7530\u6280\u672f\u90e8\u95e8\u76ee\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u3002\u4e00\u65e6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u5468A\u6388\u6743\u7ecf\u9500\u5546\u5c06\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u90a3\u65f6\u534f\u52a9\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u3002\u5c06\u5411\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ecf\u9500\u5546\u53d1\u51fa\u670d\u52a1\u516c\u544a\uff0c\u4ece\u672c\u7530\u82f1\u56fd\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6700\u597d\u54a8\u8be2\u60a8\u5f53\u5730\u7684\u672c\u7530\u6388\u6743\u7ecf\u9500\u5546\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u4f55\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u5c06\u6709\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u91ca\u653e\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u534f\u52a9\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u8054\u7cfb\u672c\u7530\u6280\u672f\u90e8\u95e8\u989d\u5916\u7684\u63f4\u52a9\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0b\u9762\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\u67e5\u770b\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u672c\u7530\u6388\u6743\u7ecf\u9500\u5546\u53ca\u5176\u8054\u7cfb\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\n\u672c\u7530\u6ca1\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u540e\u53f0\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u662f\u53d1\u9001\u66f4\u65b0\u78c1\u76d8\u4ee5\u4fee\u590d\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u95ee\u9898\u6ca1\u6709\u4fee\u590d\u3002\u672c\u7530\u8bf4\uff0c\u5b83\u6b63\u5728\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6ca1\u6709\u627e\u5230\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u65f6\u949f\u5e94\u8be5\u57288\u6708\u7684\u67d0\u4e2a\u65f6\u5019\u7ea0\u6b63\u81ea\u5df1\u3002", "note_en": "The Jalopnik inbox has been lit up with a number of reports about clocks and calendars in Honda cars getting stuck at a certain time in the year 2002. The spread is impressive, impacting Honda and Acura models as old as 2004 and as new as 2012. Here\u2019s what might be happening.\n  If you scroll through a   Honda or   Acura   forum right now, chances are you\u2019re going to run into a bunch of confused owners. When they hopped into their cars on January 1 they found the clocks on their navigation systems frozen at a certain time. And the calendar date? 2002, or 20 years ago.\n The issue is widespread, hitting a huge number of cars in Acura\u2019s and Honda\u2019s   lineup with navigation systems. And it\u2019s not just in the United States, as owners in Canada and even as far as the United Kingdom have all reported similar issues.\n      As a number of Honda and Acura owners have noted on these forums, their clocks read correctly until what appeared to have been the first time update of 2022. Then, their navigation systems turned into time machines, leaving them behind as they went back to 2002.\n    American Honda is aware of a potential concern related to the clock display on certain older Acura and Honda models equipped with navigation systems. We are currently investigating this issue to determine possible countermeasures and have no additional details to share at this time.\n  Owners have also reached out and received different responses. American Honda provided the CR-V Owners Club   forum this response:\n We have escalated the NAVI Clock Issue to our Engineering Team and they have informed us that you will experience issue from Jan 2022 thru August 2022 and then it will auto-correct. Please be assured that we will continue to monitor this and will advise you if a fix is available before that time.\n   We have just received some more information regarding this and were advised that the Honda technical department are currently working on this. Once there is a fix for this issue Honda authorized dealers will be made aware of it and will be able to assist with this at that point. A service bulletin will be issued to our dealers from Honda UK on how to fix this. As such it would be best to check with your local Honda authorized dealer for any updates as they would have the latest information for this and will be able to assist once the fix is released. They can also contact the Honda technical department for additional assistance with this if necessary.

The date is broadcasted including a number representing the week, coded in 10 binary digits. These digits count from 0 to 1023 then roll over on week 1024. GPS weeks first started on January 6, 1980 before first zeroing out on midnight August 21, 1999. It happened again April 6, 2019. The next happens in 2038.\n   If software isn\u2019t coded to account for the rollover, weird stuff can happen, like a calendar going back exactly 1024 weeks. It\u2019s impossible to know for sure without being able to look at Honda\u2019s programming, but these navigation systems might be programmed so that the start of their week counter is a date 19.6 years in the past, but not in-line with GPS epoch.\n Owners should be able to turn off the automatic update function and set the date and time manually, but they\u2019re finding that the functionality doesn\u2019t work right now. Likewise, the clock resets back to the incorrect time every time the car is started.\n  This isn\u2019t the first time that Honda and Acura owners have experienced this issue.   On August 16, 2017, Hondas and Acuras with navigation systems from model years 1999 through 2004 had their clocks reset to 0:00 and their calendars roll back to January 1, 1998. It then happened  again   on January 1, 2021 to many owners. In all cases, the time lost adds up to 1024 weeks.\n Honda didn\u2019t explain the cause back then, but the solution then was to send out update disks to fix the errors. There is no fix for the current issue. Honda says it\u2019s investigating and if it does not find a fix, the clocks should correct themselves sometime in August.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 01:23:18", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u65f6\u949f,clocks,\u672c\u7530", "title": "\u672c\u7530\u65f6\u949f\u8fc7\u53bb\u56f0\u6270\u4e8620\u5e74\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4fee\u590d", "title_en": "Honda Clocks Are Stuck 20 Years In The Past And There Isn't A Fix", "transed": 1, "url": "https://jalopnik.com/honda-clocks-are-stuck-20-years-in-the-past-and-this-mi-1848306970", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u65f6\u949f", "clocks", "\u672c\u7530"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c52c30a9cee9f47cc5dee3cb7d9009aa.jpg", "infoid": 1072531, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4eba\u4eec\u53cd\u590d\u72af\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u9519\u8bef\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8bc1\u660e\u81ea\u5df1\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u53f3\u8fb9\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4e00\u9762\u3002\n[quote]\u6211\u52aa\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6211\u60f3\u51fa\u7684\u6700\u597d\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u3002[/ quote]", "note_en": "One big mistake people repeatedly make is focusing on proving themselves right, instead of focusing on achieving the best outcome. This is the wrong side of right.\n Most people never work as hard as they do when they are trying to prove themselves right. They unconsciously hold on to the ideas and evidence that reinforce their beliefs and dismiss anything that counters. When this happens, it\u2019s not about the best outcome, it\u2019s about protecting your ego. If you\u2019ve made this mistake, you\u2019re not the only one.\n \u201cYou should take the approach that you, the entrepreneur, are wrong. Your goal is to be less wrong.\u201d\n \u2014 Elon Musk\n One of the biggest differences between running a company and working for a company is how you tend to think about solving problems.\n As a knowledge worker employed by someone else, I wanted to be right. I saw being right as how I proved my worth to both myself and the company. The best outcome was my being right. Because \u2026\n  But \u2026 I couldn\u2019t be wrong. My ego wouldn\u2019t let me.\n   [quote]I worked toward achieving the best outcome I came up with myself and not the best outcome that was possible.[/quote]\n For the longest time, I thought that if the winning idea wasn\u2019t my idea, I\u2019d be nothing. I thought no one would see me as valuable. No one would see me as insightful. People would think I wasn\u2019t adding value. And worse, I\u2019d see myself as not contributing.\n  \u201cAvoid having your ego so close to your position that when your position falls, your ego goes with it.\u201d\n \u2014 Colin Powell\n I had so much of my identity wrapped up in being right that I was blind to  how the world really works. I was  acting like an amateur \u2014 I worked toward achieving the best outcome I came up with myself and not the best outcome possible.\n At Farnam Street, one of our principles is that we work with the world as it really is, not as we want it to be. My desire to be right reflected how I wanted the world to work, not how it actually worked. Instead of trying to be right, I try to  be less wrong.\n The most important lesson I\u2019ve learned from running a company is that the more I give up trying to be right, the better the outcomes get for everyone. I don\u2019t care who gets the credit. I care about creating the best possible work.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 01:18:01", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u9519\u8bef,wrong,\u4e13\u6ce8", "title": "\u53f3\u8fb9\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4e00\u9762", "title_en": "The Wrong Side of Right", "transed": 1, "url": "https://fs.blog/wrong-side-right/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9519\u8bef", "wrong", "\u4e13\u6ce8"]}]
