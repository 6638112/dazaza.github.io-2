There have been many YouTube pronouncements about its family-friendliness, yet there are few concrete details that have convinced us it will stand out in an increasingly crowded home-gaming market. And this year, public scrutiny about the $250 system (currently open for  $100 preorder &#34;down payments&#34; or  full-price preorders, which include two controllers and six pack-in games) has grown, particularly after Intellivision\u00a0joined the 2021 virtual E3-showcase fray\u2014and did so with a resounding thud.\n Thus far, the Amico has used video presentations to show what the company hopes will set this handheld apart from the pack. Those videos mostly originate from Intellivision and a few hand-picked fan YouTube channels. Until we can go hands on with live hardware ourselves, these videos leave us with question marks about dev kits and other potentially inauthentic presentations. Leaks from an Intellivision developer portal this week will have to suffice for now, as it&#39;s a great opportunity to finally take a closer look at what the heck an Intellivision Amico actually is.\n  I began closely watching the Amico once I noticed that  its E3 2021 presentation video included unclear footage of how the device actually works. These &#34;live gameplay&#34; videos hint at Amico&#39;s central gimmick: gameplay happens primarily on a TV screen, but the device can also integrate content on an LCD screen embedded in every controller (controllers resemble  Nintendo&#39;s Wii U, albeit with smaller gamepads). However, the E3 video cuts and pans so much that we can&#39;t tell if the Amico controllers are legitimately interacting with\u00a0the nearby TV set. Older Amico videos have shown apparent lag between controller input and TV display\u2014when those videos haven&#39;t hidden the controller from view altogether, that is. This recent E3 presentation did nothing to reduce concern on that front.\n      The E3 presentation included multiple stock images of happy families playing with Amico, and Intellivision CEO Tommy Tallarico later confirmed those images were doctored\u2014DualShock-like controllers were digitally replaced with Amico&#39;s touchscreen-filled pads.  Tallarico defended the promotional choice on Twitter\u00a0by saying, &#34;That is exactly what stock photos are meant for and why they exist.&#34;\n Next to the stock photos was direct-feed footage of apparent Amico gameplay that looked simplistic and sometimes stuttering. It didn&#39;t inspire confidence in a price category that includes competent $200 to $300 options like the Nintendo Switch and Apple TV 4K. To picture it, imagine an online Flash gaming portal full of mostly flat, 2D game designs with a few 3D twists and visual flourishes, and you get some idea of Amico&#39;s visual aesthetic.\n Perhaps a different sizzle-reel approach would have done a better job selling the Amico concept, and I don&#39;t envy any marketing department dealing with a pandemic-related expo drought where a physical demo might fill in these gaps. But for a console that revolves around  the lukewarm Wii U concept of &#34;gameplay on TV, extra screen in your hand,&#34; whose last announced launch date was October 10, 2021, it sure seems like time to release more details. This is especially true for a new, unproven hardware maker, since the Intellivision brand name was acquired in 2018 by an entirely new team.\n \u201cSmart Display 200\u201d doesn\u2019t sound as cute as \u201cAmico\u201d\n Intellivision has been frank that Amico was built with budget-priced gaming in mind.\u00a0 Its official &#34;specs&#34; page makes that clear, with performance numbers that resemble lower-powered Android smartphones. But this recent leak from Intellivision&#39;s online &#34;developer&#34; portal provided concrete specifics about how much hardware power this $250 system and its controllers will eventually deliver.\n      The Intellivision developer portal was recently publicly available online, no password needed, for long enough to have the details\u00a0 saved at archive.org earlier this month. Sources with knowledge about Amico have confirmed to Ars Technica that the leaked specs we&#39;ve seen were legitimate.\u00a0While the specs were live as recently as June 14 and line up with Amico&#39;s own official specs page, they could still change between now and the system&#39;s launch.\n The Intellivision developer portal includes precise specs for various system elements in order to help game makers begin building Amico software before they receive official dev kits.\u00a0Before listing all of its specs, Intellivision&#39;s own comparison makes the point more simply:\n We&#39;ve found the ZTE ZMax Pro Z981 (Snapdragon 617, Adreno 405) is a good benchmark test and runs just a little slower than the Amico hardware.\n This model of ZTE smartphone debuted in 2016 at a budget price point of $100 unlocked\u2014and that included a 13 MP camera sensor, a 6-inch, 1080p display, and a\u00a03,400 mAh battery. In comparison, Amico works as a set-top box for your TV while embedding a 3.2-inch, 240p capacitive touchscreen into each of its controllers (two will be included in the box).\n The developer portal calls out Qualcomm&#39;s Smart Display 200 platform\u2014and specifies its &#34;APQ8053-Lite&#34; model, which includes a 1.8GHz Snapdragon 624, an Adreno 506 GPU, 2GB of LPDDR3 DRAM, 16GB of Flash storage, and built-in controllers for interfaces like HDMI, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth (but not Ethernet). While prices on bulk-manufactured SoC motherboards can vary for many reasons, this one appears to be available in bulk orders at rates near $38 per board (though that one includes a camera sensor, which Amico will not have in either its primary box or its controllers).", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:53:55", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6cc4\u6f0f,intellivision,amico", "title": "\u54ce\u5440\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u667a\u529bamico\uff1f \u63a7\u5236\u53f0\u7684\u6cc4\u6f0f\u6d41\u95e8\u6237\u7f51\u7ad9\u63d0\u4f9b\u63d0\u793a ", "title_en": "What the heck\u2019s an Intellivision Amico?

Google  detailed YouTube TV&#39;s  &#34;4K Plus&#34; subscription add-on, which costs an extra $20 on top of the standard $65-per-month plan, for a total of $85 per month. 4K Plus might sound like it will simply provide a resolution bump, but subscribing to the higher tier will also unlock a new offline playback feature and unlimited simultaneous streaming over home Wi-Fi. The latter feature is otherwise limited to three streams per account. The one no-extra-cost feature of today&#39;s announcement is 5.1 audio support, which is rolling out to all YouTube TV members.\n  YouTube TV is Google&#39;s US-only pay-per-month service meant to replace a cable TV subscription. For the base price of $65 a month, you get access to a bundle of major cable TV channels, like ESPN,\u00a0CNN, MTV, Cartoon Network, Discovery, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, TBS, TNT, USA, NFL Network, and more. The major US TV networks\u2014CBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox\u2014are all included. In addition to paying extra for 4K, you can also tack on other premium add-ons like cable TV movie channels such as HBO, Stars, Showtime, and Cinemax. Sports packages, including NFL Red Zone, are available as well.\u00a0Just like cable, YouTube TV is quite expensive and keeps getting more expensive. Google just  raised the price to $65 last year. Even if you pay the extra $20, it sounds like 4K content will be hard to come by. Google says that &#34;4K playback is available on select live and on-demand content from these networks: Discovery, ESPN, FOX Sports, FX, Nat Geo, NBC Sports, and Tastemade.&#34; The lack of 4K content isn&#39;t YouTube TV&#39;s fault, though. While Internet streaming services like Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube have all been on the 4K content train for some time, cable TV networks are still primarily producing content in 720p or 1080p. YouTube TV is essentially cable, and there&#39;s just not that much 4K content available.\n     Google&#39;s support page says that 4K playback will require an Internet connection that&#39;s at least 15Mbps. Most 4K-capable smart devices seem compatible, but Google calls out the 4K Apple TV and PlayStation 4 Pro as having iffy 4K support, saying these two devices are only compatible with &#34;select content&#34; and that &#34;some programs may have lower resolution.&#34; It sounds like\u00a0this is an AV1 video codec problem. AV1 is the next big video codec that devices will need to support, and it offers better image quality at lower bitrates, with no royalty fees. Google is a big booster of the codec, a stance that has led to  disputes over support on Roku devices. The Apple TV and the PS4 Pro both don&#39;t support AV1, so it sounds like this support note is just indicating that those devices won&#39;t be able to play exclusive AV1 4K content.\n  Offline playback might be the most interesting of YouTube TV&#39;s two new features. The offline feature will let you download DVR recordings if you&#39;re forking over $85 a month for YouTube TV with the 4K Plus package. The one big downside is that offline playback requires the YouTube TV\u00a0 app,\u00a0so that means it works on phones and Chromebooks but not on anything that would typically use a browser, like Windows, Mac, or Linux. To try to get users hooked on the $20 extra add-on, YouTube is offering an introductory price of $10 per month extra for the package for the first year.

The Columbus Dispatch  wrote. With a June 30 deadline looming, Ohio&#39;s House and Senate approved the budget and sent it to Gov. Mike DeWine for final approval on Monday night, the Dispatch wrote.\n  As we wrote  earlier this month, the Ohio Senate approved a version of the budget containing an  amendment that would have forced existing municipal broadband services to shut down and prevented the formation of new public networks. The proposed law was  reportedly &#34;inserted without prior public discussion,&#34; and no state senator publicly sponsored the amendment. It was approved in a party-line vote as Democrats opposed the restrictions in municipal broadband.\n The House version did not contain the amendment, and it was dropped during negotiations between the House and Senate.\n  Lawmakers apparently relented to public pressure from supporters of municipal broadband and cities and towns that operate the networks.\u00a0People and businesses from Fairlawn, where the city-run FairlawnGig network offers fiber Internet, played a significant role in the protests. FairlawnGig itself  asked users to put pressure on lawmakers, and the subscribers did so in great numbers.\n &#34;We had a real grassroots movement here in Fairlawn. We are thrilled our residents, subscribers, and businesses came together and helped us defeat this amendment,&#34; Fairlawn Service Director Ernie Staten said yesterday,  according to an article by\u00a0the Community Networks team at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR). &#34;We appreciate that the State of Ohio recognizes that municipal broadband has a place in this state and we hope to continue this great endeavor.&#34;\n Fairlawn subscribers sent more than 700 emails telling lawmakers, &#34;Don&#39;t take this (municipal broadband) away!&#34; Staten said.\n    The proposed law would have let cities and towns provide broadband service only to unserved areas and used a definition of &#34;unserved&#34; that would reportedly have made over 98 percent of the state ineligible for municipal broadband. The proposed law defined &#34;unserved areas&#34; as those without access to service with download speeds of at least 10Mbps and upload speeds of at least 1Mbps, which isn&#39;t even half as fast as the 25Mbps/3Mbps broadband threshold the Federal Communications Commission  adopted over six years ago.\n  Staten also pointed out that &#34;municipalities only enter the broadband space when forced to by the inaction of the private sector,&#34;  according to the Akron Beacon Journal.\n There are  about 30 public broadband providers in Ohio. Besides Fairlawn, examples of local governments running broadband networks include Hudson, Medina County, and Wadsworth.\u00a0&#34;We&#39;re thrilled that communities like Fairlawn and Hudson can keep serving their communities,&#34; Summit County Executive Ilene Shapiro said after learning that the budget amendment was dropped, according to the Akron Beacon Journal.\n Cleveland City Council President Kevin Kelley previously\u00a0 said the city would sue the state\u00a0if it restricted municipal broadband.\n Until a few months ago,  19 US states had laws restricting municipal broadband, passed for the benefit of private Internet providers that don&#39;t want to face competition from public networks. Washington state lawmakers have since  killed their anti-municipal broadband law, and Arkansas\u00a0 ended many of its restrictions\u00a0on municipal broadband as well.\n  Though it isn&#39;t banning public networks, at least for now, Ohio&#39;s legislature is apparently not letting municipal networks apply for a new round of funding.\n &#34;While Staten celebrated the removal of the budget amendment, he called the victory &#39;bittersweet,&#39; as municipalities and electric cooperatives in the state do not have access to the proposed $250 million broadband expansion grant program that will be established when, and if, Gov. Dewine signs the budget into law,&#34; the ILSR wrote.\n The outcome of that isn&#39;t certain yet. &#34;We have been asking for a small definition change to add municipalities and electric coops, but unless they changed the language, I believe the House version stands,&#34; Staten told the ILSR. But the biggest news is the legislature dropping the plan that would have forced networks to shut down. &#34;Being able to continue [providing service] is much more important,&#34; Staten said.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:53:23", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5171\u548c\u56fd,gop,\u5bbd\u5e26", "title": "\u4fc4\u4ea5\u4fc4\u5dde\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u5728\u62b5\u6297\u5c45\u6c11\u6297\u8bae\u540e\u7981\u6b62\u5e02\u653f\u5bbd\u5e26 ", "title_en": "Ohio GOP ends attempt to ban municipal broadband after protest from residents", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/ohio-gop-ends-attempt-to-ban-municipal-broadband-after-protest-from-residents/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5171\u548c\u56fd", "gop", "\u5bbd\u5e26"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "52fe1b1c0a3112af1c5e229c6f85d4f8.png", "infoid": 1068689, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u66f4\u65b0\uff1aPrivacyShark\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u62a5\u544a\u6b64\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u5df2\u4ece\u4e0b\u9762\u7684LinkedIn\u83b7\u53d6\u4e86\u8bed\u53e5\u3002\n \u636e\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684LinkedInBreac\u533a\u66b4\u9732\u4e86700\u7c73\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8d85\u8fc7756\u4e07\u7528\u6237\u768492\uff05\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u662f\u5728\u6697\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u51fa\u552e\uff0c\u8bb0\u5f55\u5305\u62ec\u7535\u8bdd\u53f7\u7801\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u5730\u5740\uff0c\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6570\u636e\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u5de5\u8d44\u3002\n \u83b7\u5f97\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ed1\u5ba2\u5df2\u53d1\u5e031M\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u68c0\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u65e2\u662f\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u6700\u65b0\u7684...\n  RestorePrivacy\u62a5\u544a\u79f0\uff0c\u9ed1\u5ba2\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6ee5\u7528\u5b98\u65b9LinkedIn API\u4ee5\u4e0b\u8f7d\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u6837\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u57284\u6708\u4efd\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\n 6\u670822\u65e5\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7684\u9ed1\u5ba2\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4ece7\u4ebf\u4e2aLinkedIn\u7528\u6237\u9500\u552e\u5e7f\u544a\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8bba\u575b\u7684\u7528\u6237\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u5305\u542b100\u4e07LinkedIn\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6837\u672c\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u68c0\u67e5\u4e86\u8be5\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u5305\u542b\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4fe1\u606f\uff1a\n  \u6839\u636e\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u68c0\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b83\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u90fd\u662f\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u5e76\u4e0e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7528\u6237\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u8868\u786e\u5b9e\u662f\u6700\u65b0\u7684\uff0c\u6765\u81ea2020\u52302021\u7684\u6837\u672c\u3002\n \u6211\u4eec\u76f4\u63a5\u5411\u7528\u6237\u81f4\u7535\uff0c\u8be5\u7528\u6237\u5728\u9ed1\u5ba2\u8bba\u575b\u4e0a\u53d1\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4ed6\u58f0\u79f0\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528LinkedIn API\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u4eba\u4eec\u4e0a\u4f20\u5230\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u6570\u636e\u3002 \n\u6ca1\u6709\u5305\u542b\u5bc6\u7801\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ad9\u70b9\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u8fd9\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u8eab\u4efd\u76d7\u7a83\u548c\u4ee4\u4eba\u4fe1\u670d\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u9493\u9c7c\u5c1d\u8bd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u81ea\u5df1\u7528\u4e8e\u83b7\u53d6LinkedIn\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u767b\u5f55\u51ed\u636e\u3002\n \u4f7f\u7528\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\uff0cLinkedIn\u786e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86500M\u8bb0\u5f55\u5305\u62ec\u4ece\u5176\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u58f0\u79f0\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u6e90\u3002 Privacyshark\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u6b64\u65f6\u53d1\u8868\u4e86\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u9648\u8ff0\uff1a\n \u867d\u7136\u6211\u4eec\u4ecd\u5728\u8c03\u67e5\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u62ec\u4eceLinkedIn\u522e\u4e0b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ece\u5176\u4ed6\u6765\u6e90\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0d\u662fLinkedIn\u6570\u636e\u8fdd\u7ea6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u786e\u5b9a\u6ca1\u6709\u66b4\u9732\u79c1\u4ebaLinkedIn\u6210\u5458\u6570\u636e\u3002\u6765\u81eaLinkedIn\u7684\u522e\u64e6\u6570\u636e\u662f\u8fdd\u53cd\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u6761\u6b3e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u65ad\u52aa\u529b\u786e\u4fdd\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4f1a\u5458\u9690\u79c1\u53d7\u5230\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002\n \u67d0\u4eba\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u591f\u522e\u767e\u4e07\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u4f7f\u7528API\u200b\u200b\u8fd8\u662f\u5176\u4ed6\uff0c\u8fd9\u7edd\u5bf9\u662f\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e......\n  \u60a8\u6b63\u5728\u9605\u8bfb9To5MAC  -

The database is for sale on the dark web, with records including phone numbers, physical addresses, geolocation data, and inferred salaries.\n The hacker who obtained the data has posted a sample of 1M records, and checks confirm that the data is both genuine and up-to-date \u2026\n  RestorePrivacy reports that the hacker appears to have misused the official LinkedIn API to download the data, the same method used in  a similar breach back in April.\n On June 22nd, a user of a popular hacker advertised data from 700 Million LinkedIn users for sale. The user of the forum posted up a sample of the data that includes 1 million LinkedIn users. We examined the sample and found it to contain the following information:\n  Based on our analysis and cross-checking data from the sample with other publicly available information, it appears all data is authentic and tied to real users. Additionally, the data does appear to be up to date, with samples from 2020 to 2021.\n We reached out directly to the user who is posting the data up for sale on the hacking forum. He claims the data was obtained by exploiting the LinkedIn API to harvest information that people upload to the site.\n No passwords are included, but as the site notes, this is still valuable data that can be used for identity theft and convincing-looking phishing attempts that can themselves be used to obtain login credentials for LinkedIn and other sites.\n With the previous breach, LinkedIn did confirm that the 500M records included data obtained from its servers, but claimed that more than one source was used.  PrivacyShark notes that the company has issued a similar statement this time:\n While we\u2019re still investigating this issue, our initial analysis indicates that the dataset includes information scraped from LinkedIn as well as information obtained from other sources. This was not a LinkedIn data breach and our investigation has determined that no private LinkedIn member data was exposed. Scraping data from LinkedIn is a violation of our Terms of Service and we are constantly working to ensure our members\u2019 privacy is protected.\n The someone was indeed able to scrape millions of records, whether using the API or otherwise, that is definitely a security breach \u2026\n  You\u2019re reading 9to5Mac \u2014 experts who break news about Apple and its surrounding ecosystem, day after day.
