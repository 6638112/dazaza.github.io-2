Writing clarifies and sharpens your thoughts in a way that is superior to merely articulating them in a conversation. It allows you to look at your ideas more objectively, almost as if they were from another person. You can then examine them and think about if what you have written down is really true.</p><p>我和其他许多人一样，已经发现，不写就几乎不可能认真思考。写作比仅在对话中表达思想更清晰，更清晰。它使您可以更客观地看待您的想法，就像它们来自另一个人一样。然后，您可以检查它们，并考​​虑您写下的内容是否真实。</p><p> However, more often than discovering that your ideas are wrong, you will discover something different: that you do not know what you think. Sure, you have some vague idea, and you believe that there is a chain of reasoning that leads to a certain conclusion. But what you will discover is that this chain of reasoning is mostly not existent. At best, it has many holes and maybe leads not where you think it does. This discovery is, of course, very unpleasant and sometimes even painful. In a sense, you have lied to yourself by thinking you have thought through this specific topic when, in reality, you have only copied the opinion of someone else.</p><p> 但是，除了发现您的想法是错误的以外，您还会发现一些不同的东西：您不知道自己的想法。当然，您有一个模糊的想法，并且您相信有一系列推理可以得出一定的结论。但是您会发现，这种推理链几乎不存在。充其量，它有很多漏洞，而且可能没有您认为的那样领先。当然，这一发现是非常不愉快的，有时甚至是痛苦的。从某种意义上说，当您实际上只是复制了他人的意见时，您就以为自己已经思考了这个特定主题，从而对自己撒谎。</p><p> This process requires an immense amount of honesty because nobody likes to feel stupid. Either you do not know what you think, in which case you feel stupid. Or it turns out that what you believed to be your opinion does not really make sense, is logically inconsistent, and mostly copied from someone else, in which case you feel stupid as well. However, the reward for all this exhausting work is clarity and simplicity. You now possess a chain of reasoning where you have looked as carefully as you can for holes and problems. The next step is to let others examine your reasoning—publishing.</p><p> 这个过程需要大量的诚实，因为没有人喜欢感到愚蠢。您要么不知道自己在想什么，在这种情况下您就会感到愚蠢。或事实证明​​，您认为自己的观点并没有真正的道理，在逻辑上是不一致的，并且大多是从别人那里复制过来的，在这种情况下，您也会感到愚蠢。然而，所有这些辛苦工作的回报是清晰和简单。现在，您拥有一连串的推理功能，在此过程中，您尽可能仔细地查找漏洞和问题。下一步是让其他人检查您的推理-发布。</p><p>  I am happy when others enjoy my work and when I can offer a new perspective, but for me, the criticism of my ideas is the most rewarding part of publishing. This is why I recently wrote:</p><p>  当别人喜欢我的作品并提出新观点时，我感到很高兴，但是对我来说，对我的观点的批评是出版中最有意义的部分。这就是为什么我最近写道：</p><p>  If you care about being less wrong tomorrow than you are today, you have to take this extreme attitude towards criticism. It will show in your writings and in the way you express your ideas. If you want to be perceived as smart and right, you will articulate your ideas in a moderate way so that others agree with it. (This is one of the main problems I have with contemporary intellectuals who always seem to take the middle ground.) If you are searching for truth, you will articulate the most extreme and radical consequences of your ideas, precisely because others will disagree with them and tell you where your ideas are wrong.</p><p>  如果您关心明天要比今天少犯错，则必须对批评持极端态度。它会以您的作品和表达想法的方式显示出来。如果您想被认为是明智而正确的，则将以一种适度的方式阐明您的想法，以使其他人对此表示赞同。 （这是我对当代知识分子的主要问题之一，他们似乎总是处于中间立场。）如果您寻求真理，那么您将清楚地表达出您想法的最极端和最根本的后果，正是因为其他人会不同意并告诉您您的想法错误的地方。</p><p> A good example is a discussion about the distribution of intelligence (not IQ) that I often have with my dad. To crudely summarize the discussion: he believes most people are too stupid to understand complex ideas; for him, this even applies to people who do not recognize the importance of free speech (the real free speech without the “but”). On the other hand, I think that the difference between people’s minds is mostly quantitative (speed and memory) and that almost everyone can understand complex ideas if they take the time and put in the effort; for me, this even applies to, e.g., quantum mechanics.</p><p> 一个很好的例子是关于我父亲经常拥有的智力（不是智商）分布的讨论。总而言之，他认为大多数人都太愚蠢，无法理解复杂的想法。对他来说，这甚至适用于那些不承认言论自由的重要性的人（没有“但是”的真正的言论自由）。另一方面，我认为人们的思想差异主要是定量的（速度和记忆力），并且几乎每个人只要花时间并付出努力就能理解复杂的想法。对我来说，这甚至适用于例如量子力学。</p><p> I do not want to get into the discussion (that’s a different essay, and it is more nuanced than I portrayed it here), but note how radically different our positions are. It is because we both put forward the most extreme consequence of our theories. If he or I cared about finding a consensus and about looking correct, we could have used different examples: he could have said that people cannot understand complex systems like capitalism, and I could have said that people are capable of understanding even classical physics.</p><p> 我不想参与讨论（这是另一篇文章，而且比我在这里所描述的更加细微），但是请注意我们的立场有多么根本的不同。这是因为我们都提出了我们理论的最极端结果。如果他或我关心达成共识并看起来正确，我们可以使用不同的例子：他可以说人们无法理解像资本主义这样的复杂系统，我可以说人们甚至能够理解古典物理学。</p><p> Notice that the disagreement looks way less severe using these examples. Some people might even argue that understanding how capitalism works is more difficult than understanding classical physics. It feels as if we are way closer to a compromise or to finding a common ground. But in reality, were are just further away from finding the truth because our disagreement is not as clear and obvious as it could be, which leads to worse criticism.</p><p>请注意，使用这些示例，分歧看起来并不那么严重。有些人甚至可能会争辩说，了解资本主义的运作方式比了解古典物理学要困难得多。感觉好像我们距离妥协或寻找共同点已经很近了。但是实际上，离我们的发现真相还很遥远，因为我们之间的分歧并不像可能的那样清晰明了，这导致了更糟糕的批评。</p><p>  This way of expressing ideas can sometimes be perceived as rude because, in contrast to most other people, you are not searching for consensus but for the truth. However, it is not a form of arrogance to express the most extreme consequences of your ideas; it is a form of intellectual honesty. In this way, your ideas are widely open to criticism, and you are therefore more likely to learn something. You are also more likely to look stupid, but that is a price you must be willing to pay.</p><p>  这种表达思想的方式有时会被视为不礼貌，因为与大多数其他人相反，您不是在寻求共识，而是在寻求真理。但是，表达您的想法的最极端后果并不是一种傲慢的形式。这是一种知识诚实的形式。这样，您的想法就很容易受到批评，因此您更有可能学到一些东西。您也看起来更愚蠢，但这是您必须愿意付出的代价。</p><p>  The inherent fuzziness of conversations makes it difficult to notice gaps in your understanding and reasoning. This applies both to your conversation partner and to yourself.</p><p>  对话固有的模糊性使得很难注意到您在理解和推理方面的差距。这适用于您的对话伙伴和您自己。</p><p> Having a conversation with someone else about your ideas is only superior to writing about them under two conditions. First, if you have already thought about your ideas on the topic a lot and have carefully examined your chain of reasoning, which, as I have already explained, is best done in writing. And second, if the other person is smart, has thought about the topic a lot as well, and values truth over consensus. If, and only if, both of these conditions are met, a conversation can be more fruitful in sharpening your ideas than writing about them. There are other advantages to conversations with regards to creativity, thought-provoking impulses, and inspiration, but for thinking deeply about a topic, writing is superior to a conversation.</p><p> 与他人就您的想法进行对话仅比在两种情况下撰写有关您的想法更好。首先，如果您已经对这个主题有很多想法，并且已经仔细检查了推理链，那么正如我已经解释的那样，最好以书面形式完成。其次，如果另一个人很聪明，那么他也会考虑这个话题，并且重视真理而不是共识。当且仅当这两个条件都满足时，对话才能使您的想法更加生动，而不是撰写想法。对话在创造力，发人深省的冲动和灵感方面还具有其他优势，但是对于深入思考主题而言，写作胜于对话。</p><p>  Anyone who reads books that are commonly known as  the classics will be somewhat discouraged from publishing their writing because these people were so smart. Every idea you come up with has probably been expressed better by someone else (most likely even by Plato because, as some say,  all of western philosophy is merely a series of footnotes to his works). Put differently by Allen Farrington:</p><p>  阅读那些通常被称为经典的书籍的人会因为出版这些著作而变得有些沮丧，因为这些人非常聪明。您提出的每个想法可能已被其他人更好地表达了（最有可能甚至是柏拉图，因为有人说，所有西方哲学只是他作品的一系列脚注）。艾伦·法灵顿（Allen Farrington）的说法不同：</p><p> “The classics are classic because those people were a lot smarter than us and we kinda wish they were still around telling the rest of us idiots what to do.”</p><p> “经典之作之所以经典，是因为那些人​​比我们聪明得多，我们有点希望他们仍然在告诉我们其他白痴该怎么做。”</p><p> Although I whole hardheartedly agree with this sentiment and might one day decide to write up my thoughts on why I think we are “stupider” than our ancestors, it does not have to be demotivating. In fact, it is quite the opposite. Recognizing that our contemporary intellectuals are, let’s just say, “not up for the task” should be a motivation for everyone else. I think the question,</p><p> 尽管我全心全意地同意这一观点，并且有一天可能决定写下我对为什么我认为我们比祖先“愚蠢”的想法，但这并不一定会令人沮丧。实际上，情况恰恰相反。可以肯定地说，认识到我们的当代知识分子“不能胜任任务”应该是其他所有人的动力。我认为这个问题</p><p>  should be answered with a resounding no. We are standing on the shoulders of giants, being mostly unworthy of the great works of the past. But it does not mean that we cannot make ourselves worthy. You (and I) may not possess the courage of Nietzsche or the wisdom of Plato, but it is our responsibility to breathe new life into their thoughts—to think them further—and since they are not around, there is no point in being discouraged.</p><p>应该用响亮的编号回答。我们站在巨人的肩膀上，几乎不配过去的伟大作品。但这并不意味着我们不能使自己有价值。您（和我）可能没有尼采的勇气或柏拉图的智慧，但是我们有责任为他们的思想注入新的生命-进一步思考他们-并且由于他们不在身边，因此沮丧是没有意义的。</p><p>  Do not compare yourself to the classics; they are dead and cannot solve our problems for us. If you need confidence, compare yourself to contemporary intellectuals, and you will see that society needs all the help it can get. Remember, “ in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king,” and one thing is certain: there are very few two-eyed men left.</p><p>  不要将自己与经典相提并论；他们死了，无法为我们解决我们的问题。如果您需要自信，请将自己与当代知识分子进行比较，您将看到社会需要它所能获得的所有帮助。请记住，“在盲人之地，独眼的人为王”，有一件事是肯定的：剩下的独眼的人很少。</p><p> Every time I get disappointed in my ability to think and articulate my thoughts, which happens frequently, I look at contemporary intellectuals and remember Bukowski’s words:</p><p> 每当我对自己思考和表达自己的思想的能力感到失望时（这经常发生），我看着当代知识分子并记住布科夫斯基的话：</p><p> “I had to continue because they were so bad, not because I was so good; and I’m still not so good, but they’re still very bad.”</p><p> “我必须继续，因为他们太糟糕了，而不是因为我太好了；而且我还不是很好，但是他们仍然很糟糕。”</p><p>  This essay is my way of saying: Start writing! You will learn as much about the topic as about yourself. You will be shocked by how often you trick yourself into falsely thinking that you have understood something. You will write and think, “Oh, is this why I think that? I didn’t know that.”</p><p>  这篇文章是我的表达方式：开始写作！您将学到与自己一样多的话题。您会以为自己经常欺骗自己以错误的方式认为自己已经了解了某些东西而感到震惊。您会写并思考：“哦，这是为什么我这么认为？我不知道。”</p><p> The process is exciting, challenging, scary, and sometimes painful, but above all, it is worth it. And one day, you and I might be able to read the great works of the past and feel that we have honored their achievements by keeping their ideas alive, and maybe we have even managed to think some of them further.</p><p> 这个过程令人兴奋，具有挑战性，令人恐惧，有时甚至是痛苦的，但最重要的是，这是值得的。有一天，您和我也许可以阅读过去的伟大著作，并感到我们通过保持他们的想法而对他们的成就感到荣幸，也许我们甚至设法进一步考虑了其中的一些。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/the-purpose-of-writing/">https://limitlesscuriosity.com/the-purpose-of-writing/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/写作/">#写作</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/purpose/">#purpose</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/想法/">#想法</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
