", "note_en": "A large facility capable of extracting significant amounts of carbon dioxide from the air is being planned for north east Scotland.\n The proposed plant would remove up to one million tonnes of CO2 every year - the same amount taken up by around 40 million trees.\n The extracted gas could be stored permanently deep under the seabed off the Scottish coast.\n    This Direct Air Capture (DAC) plan is a joint project between UK firm  Storegga and Canadian company  Carbon Engineering.\n It&#39;s at a very early stage of development - today&#39;s announcement is the beginning of the engineering and design of the plant.\n  A feasibility study has already been carried out and if everything goes well, the facility would be operational by 2026.\n  However there are many hurdles, including planning and finance - and a site for the plant won&#39;t be selected until next year.\n If it does go ahead it would be the biggest DAC facility in Europe and depending on the final configuration, could be the biggest in the world.\n  According to the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), if the world wants to stay safe, then the rise in global temperatures needs to be kept below 1.5C by the end of this century.\n There&#39;s not much wiggle room left: in 2020  temperatures were already 1.2C above the historical level.\n  To keep the mercury down, we need to curb the emissions of the warming gases that are driving them up.\n  The IPCC says that rapid cuts in carbon from cars, home heating and almost every aspect of our lives will be needed over the next decade.\n Even then, say the scientists, the world will still need to suck significant amounts of greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere to stay below the 1.5C threshold.\n While planting trees is one important approach to this problem, technology is also being used to capture CO2 directly from the air.\n &#34;Even if all the other measures that we&#39;re taking to avoid emissions, electric cars, renewable energy, those types of things, even if those succeed, you still need carbon removal,&#34; said Steve Oldham, CEO of Carbon Engineering.\n &#34;Direct air capture I think is going to be a significant part of the UK is net zero plan.&#34;\n  &#34;For us a typical facility is about a million tonnes of CO2 removal per year. That&#39;s the equivalent of 40 million trees.&#34;\n   At their pilot plant in Squamish, British Columbia, they&#39;ve been removing CO2 from the atmosphere since 2015, pulling down around 1 tonne of CO2 every day.\n Their system involves a fan to suck in air, which is then exposed to a liquid mixture that binds the carbon dioxide.\n   When these are treated at temperature of about 900C, the pellets decompose into a CO2 stream and calcium oxide.\n  At that point it can be pumped underground and buried permanently, sold for commercial use or even turned into liquid fuel.\n Right now the plan is for Carbon Engineering licence their technology to UK firm Storegga, who will be responsible for choosing the site and building the facility.\n  According to both companies involved, north east Scotland has significant advantages for this type of technology.\n  They point to the fact that there is abundant renewable energy sources, there&#39;s a skilled workforce from the North Sea oil industry that have the type of skills needed to build and operate a DAC facility.\n But a key advantage are pipelines going out under the sea to allow the permanent burial of the captured carbon.\n &#34;We&#39;re keen to locate the plant as close as possible to transport and storage infrastructure so we don&#39;t actually have to suffer more and more costs to move captured carbon offshore and then underground,&#34; said Alan James from Storegga.\n  Carbon Engineering has received significant investment from fossil fuel companies in the past and is working closely with one firm on the development of a DAC plant in Texas.\n Oil companies are keen on good quality CO2 because they can use it to flush out extra oil from depleted wells.\n  &#34;I came out of the oil industry in 2007, largely because I was getting concerned about what the impact was,&#34; he told BBC News.\n &#34;None of the emissions that we take out here will be used for extracting more hydrocarbons. That&#39;s not what our business now is about. We have nothing to do with producing hydrocarbons, period.&#34;\n  Scientists say that DAC, if deployed widely, will have major impacts on energy, water and land use.\n By 2050,  according to this report from last year, food crop prices could rise more than five-fold in some parts of the world.\n Some people are also worried that if direct air capture becomes economically viable, then governments might start to go easy on cutting emissions.\n  However, supporters of DAC say that&#39;s not the case - they argue that for sectors that are hard to cut, including shipping, aviation and the oil and gas industry, then DAC is a good option for limiting their impact on the climate.\n Researchers who&#39;ve studied these emerging technologies say it would be foolish to rely fully on them and neglect the basic steps of decarbonising power, transport and industry.\n &#34;It&#39;s a much more sensible strategy to treat these technologies as a really nice addition, we should work hard on them and make sure that they can become cost competitive, and economic in the 2020s,&#34; said Dr Ajay Gambhir, a senior research fellow at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment.\n &#34;But at the same time, we need to just make sure we reduce emissions as fast as possible as far as possible.

 Boxabl\uff08@_boxabl\uff094\u670822\u65e5\uff0c2021 ", "note_en": "The world\u2019s richest people are known to live the most extravagant lives. Any one of us would probably do the same: work your way to a considerable fortune, and you\u2019d splurge on  luxury accommodation, luxury cars, luxury vacations, luxury everything. As far as Musk is concerned, billionaire or not, he can do very well without a couple of items on that list\u2014including luxury accommodation.    \rA while back, Musk caused a lot of buzz online by announcing plans to sell his entire real estate portfolio, which was predictably impressive. He went ahead with the plans, and, as far of the world knows, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO is now homeless, more or less. According to one of his tweets from earlier this month, he now lives on SpaceX property in a house that\u2019s worth some $50,000.     \r\u201cMy primary home is literally a ~$50k house in Boca Chica / Starbase that I rent from SpaceX. It\u2019s kinda awesome though,\u201d Musk wrote.  \u201cOnly house I own is the events house in the Bay Area. If I sold it, the house would see less use, unless bought by a big family, which might happen some day.\u201d     The fact that Musk doesn\u2019t even  own the cheap house he lives in when in Texas is just the icing on the cake. According to  Teslarati, that house is actually a prefabricated, towable tiny home called Boxabl Casita\u2014the cheapest model (and the only one available for preorder as of the moment of press).  Boxabl actually hinted at this back in November 2020, when they revealed they had delivered a unit to Boca Chica for a then-mysterious A-list client.    \rThe Casita is as adorable as the name suggests. It\u2019s a 20x20 foot ( 6x6 meter) home-made of concrete panels, steel and EPS foam that can be shipped or towed (even by  a Model X, as one of the tweets available at the bottom of the page shows) directly to the buyer. Setting it up takes between one hour and one day, depending on the setup the owner wants: the Casita can be made for off-grid living or hooked up to utilities. Also depending on this, the setup can imply a variety of additional costs.    \rStill, the Casita itself starts at $50,000 and is made to  \u201clast a lifetime.\u201d The walls, floor, and roof are structurally laminated panels rated higher for insulation and durability than everything else on the traditional home-building market. The Casita is hurricane and storm resistant, fire-resistant, flood-resistant, and 90% rated for snow. It\u2019s cheap to maintain and can be made even cheaper by means of solar panels, backup batteries, and  smart tech.    \rThe base model is perfect for a small family, being more of a studio apartment: it\u2019s basically a square space divided into four living areas. You have a master bedroom area, a kitchen area, a bathroom, and a living slash dining area. That said, it\u2019s well organized, quite good looking and airy due to the high ceiling. More importantly, it&#39;s well equipped: you have a large fridge, a washer-dryer unit, a dishwasher, a double sink, an ironing board, and an oven and microwave in the kitchen; the bathroom has a deep shower tub, and a sizable counter; you get heating and AC as part of the standard package.     The idea is for Boxabl to start offering larger models soon, variations on this tiny Casita, while also including this one as  a module for larger constructions. Boxabl believes that the housing industry needs to evolve and head into mass production to be more efficient and more affordable. The only way out of the housing crisis, the company CEO says in one of the videos below, is by offering units that are more durable, more affordable, and with shorter delivery dates.    \rClearly, the Boxabl Casita unit is awesome enough to have caught the eye of  Elon Musk. But Boxabl likes to dream of a future well beyond building on Earth: they recently unveiled a concept for a Mars unit, based on the idea that the Casita can also serve for medical or military use in disaster or conflict areas. Why not think ahead into the not-too-distant future in which  Musk leads humanity on a mission to colonize Mars?      My primary home is literally a ~$50k house in Boca Chica / Starbase that I rent from SpaceX. It\u2019s kinda awesome though.   \rOnly house I own is the events house in the Bay Area. If I sold it, the house would see less use, unless bought by a big family, which might happen some day.\n\r\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk)  June 9, 2021\n      Eagerly awaiting the Cybertruck, need 12,000 pound tow capacity  @elonmusk. #tech  #startup  #housing  #construction  \rDisclaimer: Model X not rated to tow Casita.

The signed overflow UB exploitation is an attempt to work around this.\n    To be more precise: the #1 transform that compilers really want to get out of this is to replace int32\n  loop counters with int64 loop counters in 64-bit code whenever possible, because int32s are bad news\n                                                    That MOVSXD (marked *) is indicative of the issue: we&#39;re on a 64-bit machine trying to use a 32-bit index to\n  refer to an array, and because addresses are 64-bit (and we could absolutely have an array larger than 4GB but\n  with less than 2 billion entries), we need to sign-extend that index to 64-bit before we can do our addressing\n      That sign-extend is extra work in the inner loop that would not exist in the 32-bit version of this snippet.\n  It also causes other problems. For example, the 32-bit equivalent of the code above always accesses memory at\n        and ebx is what&#39;s called an &#34;induction variable&#34; - it changes by a constant value in every loop iteration\n  (incrementing by 1 in this case). A 32-bit compiler can realize this and replace it with pointer arithmetic\n  (incrementing esi by 4 every iter, say). &#34;esi&#34; and &#34;ebx&#34; are both 32-bit values subject to 32-bit wraparound,\n              with a sign extend in the middle (that &#34;sext32to64(ebx)&#34; is what the &#34;movsxd rbx, edx&#34; does). And in\n    dramatically, by (4 - 2^(32+2)). In 32-bit mode (all addresses modulo 2^32), this is just an increase by 4\n  as usual; the &#34;wraparound&#34; part is a multiple of 2^32 and hence invisible. In 64-bit mode, it isn&#39;t; if the\n            Option a) is relatively straightforward in this particular example, but it can get hairy, and my point is\n  that 32-bit compilers never need to worry about any of this to begin with (and neither do 64-bit compilers\n      And if the compiler *isn&#39;t* able to do these proofs, it can get pretty bad. For example, the loop above\n  is basically all loop overhead, and most compilers will end up unrolling (or vectorizing, but I&#39;ll\n  ignore that) it. Now we&#39;d prefer to see an inner loop like: (I won&#39;t show the setup or tail loop here):\n                      (only showing the adressing parts here, in practice there&#39;s other transforms we&#39;d like to see too, but\n      If the compiler can&#39;t (for whatever reason) prove that the index expressions are not going to overflow\n                                      This is a silly example, but all you need to do is look at some assembly listings for\n    &#34;movsxd&#34;; usually you&#39;ll be able to find actual addressing code that does stuff like this\n      Anyway, as said, compilers use the signed-overflow UB as a free ticket to promote int32\n            to int etc.) work pretty well when &#34;int&#34; is the width of machine registers and pretty\n  badly when it&#39;s not. Newer languages (e.g. Go and Rust) solve this problem by just making\n  &#34;int&#34; be 64-bit on 64-bit platforms, which removes most of the motivation for this kind\n          Eating the sign extends (and resulting extra work) on cold code is not *that* bad if\n  there&#39;s a way for the compiler to tell the programmer about the hot loops that really\n        often as much (or more) of a problem than the extra instructions. On x64, it is in\n          or similar. The top 32 bits of &#34;rbx&#34; will get zero-cleared the next time a 32-bit ALU\n  op writes to ebx, but that&#39;s fine. At least we didn&#39;t use an extra register.\n    e.g. show when overflows can&#39;t happen in a loop such as the example loop (in this\n  case: if we can prove &#34;count&#34; stays fixed throughout the loop, we only enter the loop\n  if &#34;0 &lt; count&#34;, and we only stay in the loop until &#34;i &gt;= count&#34;; with i increasing at\n  a rate of 1 per iteration, this is guaranteed to happen before i overflows). This is\n      programmer, and it can be really hard to understand what the compiler can or cannot\n  prove at any given point in time. So it&#39;s tricky. Better analysis catches more and\n      If in doubt, it&#39;s almost always preferable to have semantics defined in such a way\n                                    of many arithmetic operations, and your life sucks no matter what.
