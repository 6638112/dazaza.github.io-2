We look forward to seeing you in the arena and hope you try the Crackdown Update that went live today!\u201d\n  This potential ad rollout had been particularly noteworthy because the ads were being tested inside a title from a third-party developer. Facebook has purchased a handful of VR studios in recent months and owns a number of the most popular Quest titles inside its marketplace, so the opportunity to roll out advertising with a third-party partner gave Facebook an chance to frame the advertising rollout as a way for other developers to open up their monetization channels, rather than for Facebook to do so.\n The announcement last week still brought out plenty of critics in the VR community who weren\u2019t thrilled about Facebook\u2019s broader struggles with balancing advertising efforts with user privacy, but other users seemed to be more annoyed by the prospect of ads being rolled out inside a paid title they had already purchased.  Blaston retails for $9.99 in the Oculus store.\n Resolution Games abandoning the test before it even started is an early setback for Facebook\u2019s VR advertising efforts that showcases just how skeptical the Oculus platform\u2019s most vocal users still are of Facebook. In a blog post last week, Facebook sought to address early concerns with what user data would be used to serve up advertising in VR, specifically noting that conversations recorded by the headset\u2019s microphone and images analyzed by the onboard tracking cameras would not be used.\n Facebook saw considerable backlash last year from virtual reality fans when they shared that new headset owners would need a Facebook account in order to activate their devices. While criticism poured in following the announcement, the recently released $299 Quest 2 headset has already outsold all of Facebook\u2019s previous VR devices combined, the company has said.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 06:47:38", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "facebook,\u5e7f\u544a,\u8fdb\u5165,entry", "title": "Facebook\u7684\u8fdb\u5165VR\u5e7f\u544a\u4e0d\u4f1a\u592a\u597d ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tFacebook\u2019s entry into VR advertising isn\u2019t going too well\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebooks-entry-into-vr-advertising-isnt-going-too-well/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["facebook", "\u5e7f\u544a", "\u8fdb\u5165", "entry"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c0e1be35788304c1f8d3f08471141a59.png", "infoid": 1067308, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6682\u65e0\u8bc4\u8bba \uff1a ", "note_en": "No comments :", "posttime": "2021-06-22 06:39:56", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe,framework,\u6682\u65e0", "title": "SLSA\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6 ", "title_en": "SLSA, an End-to-End Framework for Supply Chain Integrity", "transed": 1, "url": "https://security.googleblog.com/2021/06/introducing-slsa-end-to-end-framework.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe", "framework", "\u6682\u65e0"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "2cbf030bcdcc24d01234e98cd7ff3a36.jpg", "infoid": 1067307, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8499\u7279\u5229\u5c14\u4e0b\u6b21\u4e58\u5750\u7535\u68af\u5230\u653f\u5e9c\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u542c\u5230\u8f83\u5c11\u7684\u7f8e\u56fd\u6d41\u884c\u51fb\u4e2d\uff0c\u4eceCeline Dion\uff06\uff0339;

I actually hope that one day, videos like this and the whole coming out process are not necessary, but until then I will do my best and my part to cultivate a culture that\u2019s accepting and compassionate and I\u2019m going to start by donating $100,000 to the Trevor Project. They\u2019re an incredible organization, they\u2019re the number one suicide-prevention service for LGBTQ youth in America and they\u2019re truly doing incredible things.

He has 20.5 career sacks. He played in college for Penn State (where I am a proud alum).\n No openly active gay or bi player has ever played a down in an NFL regular season game.
