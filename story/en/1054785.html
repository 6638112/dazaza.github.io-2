They go for the weather, the four thousand yearly hours of baking sunlight. They go for the casinos, rising up by the highway on the lands of the Quechan and the Cocopah. They go to witness the arsenal of the largest standing army in the world at the Yuma Proving Grounds, where mortars and brimstone missiles pummel the Sonoran Desert. And then there are people who go for the same reason I did: because they’re afflicted with aching and rotting teeth, with broken molars and crooked gums, mouths full of pain that follow them around like debts. Because just across the border from Yuma, so close you can walk it, is Los Algodones—Molar City. The dental tourism capital of the world.</p><p>你会感到惊讶的是人们必须去亚利桑那州尤马的原因。他们为天气而努力，四千年的烘烤阳光。他们去赌场，在戒指和Cocopah的土地上崛起。他们去看世界上最大的常设军队的阿森纳，在尤马证明的场地，迫击炮和硫磺导弹戴上索诺兰沙漠。然后有人出于同样的原因，我做了因为只是在yuma的边界，所以你可以走路，是los algodones-molar城市。世界的牙科旅游资本。</p><p> Every year roughly 120,000 Canadians and Americans cross the border into Los Algodones. There they spend millions of dollars on dental care that costs a fraction of what it does back home. The town’s population hovers around five thousand, but it’s home to over five hundred practicing dentists who power the local economy and contribute to the booming global medical tourism industry.</p><p> 每年大约12万加拿大人和美国人将边境跨越LOS algodes。在那里，他们花费数百万美元的牙科护理费用，这花费了一小部分回家。该镇的人口徘徊在五千左右，但它是超过五百多百练习当地经济的牙医，并为蓬勃发展的全球医疗旅游业做出贡献。</p><p> Medical tourism is a deceptively sunny phrase for the lengths a person will go to escape their pain. It’s a type of migration that can only exist under certain asymmetries of care and certain conditions of capitalism. When health is a commodity it feels realer the more dearly you have paid for it. But medical tourism is the inverse: health as a bargain, health as a matter of exchange rates. Health as a gamble.</p><p> 医疗旅游是一个愚蠢的阳光灿烂的短语，一个人会逃避他们的痛苦。这是一种迁移的类型，只能在关心的某些不对称和资本主义条件下存在。当健康是一种商品时，它会越来越认真地为此而越多。但医疗旅游是逆：健康作为讨价还价，作为汇率的酬金。健康作为赌博。</p><p>  In her novel  The Story of My Teeth, the Mexican author Valeria Luiselli describes: “The teeth are the true windows to the soul; they are the tabula rasa on which all our vices and all our virtues are inscribed.”</p><p>  在她的小说中，墨西哥作者Valeria Luiselli描述了：“牙齿是灵魂的真正窗户;他们是我们所有的恶习和我们所有的美德的塔巴拉Rasa。“</p><p> It’s true you can learn a lot from teeth. From the flattening of canines you can learn when ancient cultures transitioned from hunting to agriculture, and proof of famines has been discovered in the hypoplasias on the enamel of the dead. You can tell who ate with their fingers, who lived in the rain shadow of a mountain, who dined on the sacramental nectar of a child deity. Teeth are a biography in the macro, stamped with facts about ourselves that are barely recognizable from the vantage point.</p><p> 这是真的，你可以从牙齿中学到很多。从犬歌的平坦化你可以学习当从狩猎到农业的古代文化和饥荒的证据时，已经在死者的牙釉质上发现了饥荒。你可以告诉谁用手指吃了，他住在山的雨影的阴影中，他在童话的圣洁花蜜上用餐。牙齿是宏观的传记，盖上了关于我们自己几乎无法识别的事实。</p><p> The story of my teeth is relatively simple: they’re expensive and they break often. Some people buy Rolexes that keep worse time than a microwave, I pay for teeth that don’t work. I’ve had some two-dozen-plus cavities filled, two root canals, my wisdom teeth extracted, my enamel soaked in fluoride gel, all costing somewhere north of twenty thousand dollars. Some of this I’ve paid out of pocket, some has been covered by insurance via my partner or jobs. I’ll likely have to spend almost as much on more work imminently, though it’s less certain how I’ll pay for it.</p><p> 我牙齿的故事比较简单：它们很贵，他们经常突破。有些人购买罗克斯，这比微波更糟糕的时间，我支付不起作用的牙齿。我有一些填充了两个二十多个加洞，我的智齿提取，我的珐琅浸泡在氟凝胶中，所有人都在北方的两万美元。其中一些我正在从口袋里支付，有些人已经通过我的伴侣或工作所覆盖。我可能必须尽可能多地花费更多的工作，尽管它不太确定如何支付它。</p><p> I think of my teeth as a kind of debt. Even the archaic word for cavities— caries—implies shouldering a burden. Anyone who’s carried debt knows the way it can discolour a life, forcing a sense of foreclosure onto reality, making disaster feel inevitable.</p><p> 我认为我的牙齿是一种债务。即使是苍蝇的古老话语也意味着肩负着负担。任何携带债务的人都知道它可以贬低生命的方式，强迫丧失抵押品赎回权的意识，让灾难感到不可避免。 </p><p>  The morning of my first day travelling to Los Algodones, I woke up in the Quechan Resort Casino with a toothache. The pain emanated from my maxillary second molar, the four-cusped workhorse that allows mammals to chew. My molar was at this point less of a tooth than it was a tiny cairn of crumbling enamel, ruined by cavities to the extent that it could no longer support a crown. The last fragment broke off on a cherrystone a few months before; I remembered holding the fragment over the kitchen sink, cherry juice staining it like blood.</p><p>我早上前往Los algodones旅行，我醒来的休息室赌场赌场。疼痛从我的上颌第二磨牙散发出来，这是允许哺乳动物咀嚼的四个轴的摩尔。我的臼齿在这一点上的牙齿少于它是一个小型的摇摇欲坠的搪瓷，被空腔毁了到它不再支撑冠部的程度。最后几个月前的最后一个片段在樱石上脱落了;我记得拿着厨房水槽的碎片，樱桃汁染色它喜欢血液。</p><p> It had ached while I travelled: on the plane from Toronto, in the glassed-in smoker’s pen at Washington Dulles airport, during the stopover in Dallas, and again during the one in El Paso. It had ached as I sat in the back of the Uber that drove me from the Yuma airport through the darkened desert to Quechan reservation. I asked the driver if he had ever been to Los Algodones and he told me he was a Marine stationed nearby, and they weren’t allowed to cross the border.</p><p> 在我旅行的时候疼痛了：在多伦多的飞机上，在华盛顿杜勒斯机场的玻璃吸烟笔中，在达拉斯中途停留，再次在埃尔帕索。当我坐在优步的背面时，它已经坐在推动我从Yuma机场通过黑暗的沙漠向我进行预订。我问司机如果他去过Los algodes，他告诉我他是一个附近的海洋，他们不允许越过边境。</p><p> Outside my window I could see the pool and the parking lot with its knuckled palm trees, dotted with   RVs. Beyond that, the expanse of the desert: endless miles of creosote and broken rock. It was late February, the end of snowbird season and the beginning of long months of unendurable heat. One state north, Bernie Sanders was trying to take the Nevada caucus and bring the country closer to a nationalized system of healthcare than it had come in a century. Less than a month later a global pandemic would make the idea of getting on a plane or crossing a border terrifying.</p><p> 在我的窗外，我可以看到游泳池和带有指定的棕榈树的停车场，用RV点缀。除此之外，沙漠的广阔：无尽的克雷糖和破碎的岩石。二月末，雪鸟季节结束和长期不尽的热量的开始。北方的一个州，伯尼桑德斯试图乘坐内华达院长，将该国更接近一个国有化的医疗保健系统，而不是一个世纪。不到一个月后，全球大流行将使乘坐飞机或过境地恐怖的想法。</p><p>  In the lobby I was greeted by the tidal hum of slot machines. The Quechan Casino feels less like a palace of sin than it does a server farm: a dim, air conditioned, and windowless silo where machines chirp and flash as they extract your money with a ruthless, algorithmic efficiency. Cigarette smoke rose towards the ceiling and the   ATM charged $7 per withdrawal.</p><p>  在大厅里，我被老虎机的潮汐嗡嗡声迎来了。 Quechan Casino感觉不像一个派遣宫，比服务器农场的宫殿：一个暗淡，空调和无窗筒仓，当他们用无情的算法效率提取您的资金时，机器啁啾和闪存。卷烟烟雾朝向天花板，ATM每次退出收取7美元。</p><p> Outside, the desert air was hot and bacterialess. If the interior of the casino suited tooth pain, a midnighter’s disease, this was dentist country, the sun bright and lidless as a headlamp. The road ran alongside a narrow creek, choked with river grass and paddled by cormorants. This, I realized, was the Colorado River. This was where one the mightiest rivers in the world, the one that fills the Grand Canyon and powers Las Vegas, limps free of the continental United States and into Mexico, dissipating in a brackish delta of mudflats and sandbars. At Hoover Dam, the impounded waters of the Colorado power turbines that weigh hundreds of tons. A day’s drive south and you could throw a stone across it.</p><p> 外面，沙漠空气很热和细菌。如果赌场内部牙齿疼痛，这是一个中间人的疾病，这是牙医国家，太阳明亮而透明，作为前照灯。路沿着一条狭窄的小溪跑，用河草窒息并被鸬鹚划桨。这是，我意识到，是科罗拉多河。这是世界上最强大的河流，填补了大峡谷和力量拉斯维加斯的人，跛行的巨额没有大陆美国和墨西哥，散发在野蛮的泥滩和沙栏的咸斯特拉。在Hoover Dam，Colorado动力涡轮机的蓄水水位称重数百吨。一天的南风，你可以扔石头。</p><p> The enamel of a tooth is made up of millions of microscopic prisms, arranged in rows. Stacked together like a woodpile, they form the hardest and most inorganic substance in the body, a mineral explosion driven by the aggregate electrical current of cell clusters that start to conspire long before we’ve even developed spines. They’re a foreign substance, only partially organic and generated by a flourish of primeval chemistry. They aren’t flesh, but they can hurt like flesh. You can go into debt over them like flesh. You can find yourself crippled by them like flesh.</p><p> 牙齿的珐琅由数百万微观棱镜组成，以行排列。如林下堆叠在一起，它们形成了身体中最难和最无机的物质，这是一种由电池集群的聚集电流驱动的矿物爆炸，这在我们甚至开发出刺之前开始终结。它们是异物，仅部分有机，由蓬勃发展的原始化学。他们不是肉，但他们可以像肉体一样伤害。你可以像肉体一样陷入困境。你可以发现自己像肉体一样瘫痪。</p><p>  The Andrade Port of Entry is the lowest volume border checkpoint along the U.S.–Mexico border. The Trump administration’s vision of a border wall hangs over the Southwest like a hallucinatory fantasy, and you can see evidence of it close to Yuma, where construction was recently completed on over two hundred miles of new fencing, a corrugated monstrosity that resembles a Richard Serra sculpture. But at the Andrade Port, the border is little more than a length of barbed wire fence and a few crumbled concrete outbuildings. A Quechan-run parking lot allows crossers on the   U.S. side to park their cars before walking through a narrow passageway and into a shed, ostensibly our last few steps on American soil. Inside there were no questions, no declarations, no people in uniforms wielding rubber stamps. Just an unplugged metal detector and a dog dozing in a wire cage.</p><p>  进入的Andrade港口是美国墨西哥边境的最低卷边界检查点。特朗普政府对边境墙的愿景悬挂在西南部的幻想之类的幻想中，您可以看到它靠近Yuma的证据，其中建设最近完成了超过两百英里的新围栏，这是一种类似于Richard Serra的瓦楞泥装饰雕塑。但在安德拉德港口，边界几乎没有长度的铁丝网和一些碎混凝土外建筑。 Quechan-Run停车场允许在美国的横穿路上乘坐汽车，然后在穿过狭窄的通道之前停放他们的汽车，并在美国土地上的最后几个步骤。内部没有问题，没有声明，没有人穿制服挥舞着橡皮戳。只是一个拔出的金属探测器和狗在线笼中的狗。 </p><p> It doesn’t feel like a place at all. Which is a condition it shares with all borders: feeling separate from the locations they straddle, the last breath between them but unclaimed by each.</p><p>它不像一个地方。这是一个与所有边界共享的条件：感觉与他们跨行的位置分开，它们之间的最后一口气，但每个人都没有认领。</p><p> Modern medicine views the mouth and the teeth inside it the same way. That’s why an annual physical almost never includes a look inside your mouth; it’s less a part of a body than a front gate. But in her book  Teeth, Mary Otto explains why this is hubris: “Pain, loss of function, serious illness, and even death result from untreated oral conditions and offer harrowing reminders that the mouth is part of the body and that oral health is essential to overall health.”</p><p> 现代医学在同样的方式看着嘴巴和牙齿。这就是为什么每年的物理几乎从不包括嘴里的外观;它不仅仅是正文的一部分而不是前门。但在她的书牙齿中，玛丽奥托解释了为什么这是哈布里斯：“痛苦，功能丧失，严重的疾病，甚至死亡，甚至是未经治疗的口腔条件的痛苦，并提供了嘴巴是身体的一部分，并且口腔健康是必不可少的整体健康。“</p><p> Dental care is rarely included in conversations about expanding rights to accessible medical care or in the medical industries schemas of health, despite the fact that tooth decay afflicts almost half the population of Earth, and global spending on dental procedures outstrips that of cancer treatments or vaccine research. The mouth’s living tissue is home to millions of microflora and organic systems, varied ecologies, and bacterial cultures that pass through it to the body to provide its life-giving balance. There is no possibility of living without that variety, that puncture between the inside and the out.</p><p> 牙科护理很少包括在扩大可访问的医疗护理或健康的医疗行业模式的对话中，尽管蛀牙折磨几乎是地球人口的几半，以及全球牙科手术支出超过癌症治疗或疫苗研究。口的活组织是数百万微生物和有机系统，不同的生态和细菌培养物，通过它到身体的细菌培养物，以提供其生命平衡。没有这种品种的生活没有可能，内部和出局之间的刺穿。</p><p>  It’s hard to imagine how truly full of dentists Los Algodones is. It’s like trying to imagine a city full of piano movers. They are, quite literally, everywhere. Memories of inconveniently scheduled cleanings quake in the face of the omnipresent availability, the frantic, logicless convenience. They line the streets, sit atop one another in stories, share entrances. The sky in Los Algodones looks down on a canopy of signage, emblazoned with Xeroxed grins. Clinics compete for claims: the quickest, the cleanest, the most painless, the most popular service in town. As soon as I set foot past the border checkpoint I was greeted by men in medical scrubs, construction boots poking from beneath their airy blue pant legs, who thrust pamphlets and flyers in my hands. One man strolled in lazy circles wearing a sandwich board that advertised veneers.</p><p>  很难想象牙医洛杉矶的真正充满了。这就像试图想象一个充满钢琴搬家的城市。他们在字面上，到处都是。面对无所不能的可用性，疯狂，逻辑的便利，疯狂的清理消暑的回忆。他们排队街道，坐在彼此的故事中，分享入口。 LOS algodones中的天空俯视着标志的树冠，与Xeroxed Grins一起赞美。诊所竞争索赔：最快，最干净，最无痛的，城镇最受欢迎的服务。一旦我踏上边境检查点，我被医疗磨砂膏的男子招呼，建筑靴子从他们的通风蓝裤腿下戳戳，他在我手中推动小册子和传单。一名男子漫步在懒人圈子穿着夹心板宣传贴面。</p><p> In my long history of dental work, I have never once been told the cost of a procedure before agreeing to it. In the dentist’s chair with a broken or infected tooth, you don’t feel like a customer; you feel like someone being offered a lifeline out of medical catastrophe, and only a lunatic would think about money at a moment like that. Better to think of it afterwards, with your mouth swollen and bloody, waiting to see if your credit card is declined.</p><p> 在我历史悠久的牙科工作历史中，我从来没有告诉过在同意它之前的程序费用。在牙医的椅子上有破碎或受感染的牙齿，你不像客户一样;你觉得有人被提供出一个医疗灾难的生命线，只有一个疯子会在那样的时刻考虑金钱。更好地想到它后，用嘴肿胀和血腥，等着看你的信用卡是否被拒绝。</p><p> In Los Algodones, however, competitive pricing is the order of the day; it’s on signs and on the flyers shoved into your hands and yelled to you from storefronts. Having a tooth pulled costs roughly $50   USD, about as much as a carton of Duty-Free cigarettes. A dental implant, in which the living root of a tooth is replaced by a metal screw and topped with a prosthetic lump of fused porcelain, runs about $1,600 in Canada and as much as $4,000 in the   U.S. (I know because I desperately need two that I haven’t been able to afford to replace the crumbling temporaries following root canals). In Los Algodones they cost around $450, which means I could rebuild one side of my mouth and come out better than if I were to accidentally drop my phone.</p><p> 然而，在LOS algodones中，竞争定价是当天的顺序;它在迹象和传单上掌握在你的手中，并从店面向你喊叫。牙齿被拉的成本约为50美元，大约一如既往的免税香烟。一种牙科植入物，其中牙齿的活根被金属螺钉所取代，并搭配稠合瓷器的假块，加拿大约为1,600美元，在美国多达4,000美元（我知道，因为我迫切需要两个我没有能够在根运河之后取代粉碎的临时）。在LOS algodones中，他们的价格约为450美元，这意味着我可以重建嘴的一侧，比我不小心掉下手机更好地走出来。</p><p> All this made me feel suddenly, drunkenly rich. I didn’t feel like someone who had flown across the continent on a long shot, but instead like a tourist, secure in the sudden radioactive potency of my currency. I walked with the thin, late season crowd through the streets, numbers dancing in my head. All around me, sunburnt couples strolled, boozy, willing to loiter in their relief. People haggled over the price of Harley Davidson wallets with street vendors, while other vendors across the street selling identical Harley Davidson wallets watched. I stopped in a restaurant where a mariachi band listlessly played a Don Henley set and the bar sagged under gallon jugs of margarita mix crowned with upended tequila bottles. Around me, people drank heavily through swollen jaws. The various accents of the continental   U.S. cut the rudiments of Spanish vocabulary into starchy chunks. Hawkers walked between tables, selling hammered tin star fish, tequila bottles shaped like revolvers, cigars, ponchos done up to look like   NFL jerseys. Maybe this is what borders are, I thought, places where commerce and commodities and junk and medicine all collect, washing together like flotsam at an inlet.</p><p> 所有这一切让我感到突然，醉酒富裕。我不觉得有一个在长射边飞过大陆的人，而是像旅游一样，在我国货币的突然放射性效力中确保了安全。我走过薄薄的，晚期人群穿过街道，在我脑海里跳舞。在我身边，晒黑夫妇漫步，笨拙，愿意在他们的救援中徘徊。人们唠叨了哈利戴维森钱包的价格与街头供应商，而其他街道上的其他供应商销售相同的哈利戴维森钱包。我停在一家餐馆里，玛丽亚奇乐队无所不意地播放了唐亨利套装，酒吧在加仑玛格丽塔队的加仑山上追逐，加强了达到龙舌兰酒瓶。在我身边，人们通过肿胀的下颚挣扎。美国大陆大陆的各种口音将西班牙词汇的雏形切成淀粉块。霍克斯走在桌子之间，卖锤锡星鱼，龙舌兰酒瓶，形状像左轮手枪，雪茄，Ponchos看起来像NFL球衣一样。也许这就是毗邻的是，我想，商品和商品和垃圾和医学都收集的地方，像槟榔一样在入口处洗涤。 </p><p>  Dentists in Mexico are able to offer such cutthroat prices for the same reason it’s easier to buy a pair of Levi’s that are made in Istanbul, or a casserole dish that was assembled in Thailand. The inequities between its national economy and the global superpowers in the West mean that the costs of production and wages are astonishingly low compared to the   U.S. and Canada. But Mexican dentists also benefit from subsidized training, which means they don’t graduate saddled by enormous loads of student debt. And in Mexico, dentists are not required to have malpractice insurance, which can cost Canadian or American dentists thousands of dollars per year.</p><p>墨西哥的牙医能够提供这种碎片价格，有同样的原因，在伊斯坦布尔或泰国组装的砂锅菜中，更容易购买一对Levi的价格。西方国民经济与全球超级大国之间的不公平意味着与美国和加拿大相比，生产和工资的成本令人惊讶地低。但墨西哥牙医也受益于补贴培训，这意味着他们不会被巨大的债务致死地掩盖。在墨西哥，牙医不需要有弊端保险，每年可以花费加拿大或美国牙医千元。</p><p> This last point is what makes getting your teeth fixed in Los Algodones possible, but it’s also what makes people wary. On internet forums and Facebook, users exchange recommendations and tips with other medical tourists, and there are a minority of horror stories. People have exchanged the pain of broken teeth for the pain of bridges that aren’t correctly set, or implants that come loose. But that’s a risk you run in Canada or the United States, too.</p><p> 最后一点是让你的牙齿在los algodones中修复，但它也是让人谨慎的原因。在互联网论坛和Facebook上，用户与其他医疗游客交换建议和提示，并且有少数恐怖故事。人们已经交换了破碎的牙齿的痛苦，以便无法正确设置的桥梁疼痛，或植入物的植入物。但这也是您在加拿大或美国运行的风险。</p><p> The question of why dental care is so expensive in Canada and the   U.S. requires some explanation. Dentistry has historically sat adjacent to respectable medicine. The first dentists were itinerant surgeons who worked in city squares rather than in medical colleges. They represented a medieval tradition of travelling cures, and a dentist in the 18th century might as likely be a mesmerist, or an applier of leeches, or a peddler of mercury tonics. At their best, they were individuals gifted with a combination of salesmanship, common sense, and a stomach for gore.</p><p> 为什么牙科护理在加拿大和美国昂贵的问题需要一些解释。牙科历史悠久地坐在尊重的药物附近。第一个牙医是在城市广场而不是医学院工作的巡回外科医生。他们代表着旅行治疗的中世纪传统，18世纪的牙医可能很可能是乳房的，或水蛭的猫头鹰或汞调节的小贩。他们最好，他们是有销售，常识和血胃胃的组合的人。</p><p> This made it unattractive to physicians, who emerged from the same quagmire of competing cures but managed to elevate their own professional standing, not least via the exclusion of other practices. As a hierarchy of human physiology developed, divided, and subdivided into territories of expertise, the mouth and those that worked on it were excluded. Charles Harris, the father of American dentistry, made attempts to integrate dentists into medical colleges during the mid-1800s and was rebuffed. This, even as breakthroughs in science had shown the way that a rotten tooth might transmit infected blood to the brain, and how bacteria and unicellular organisms travelled through the world like a second kind of air, dashing the notion that health could be separated from the environment, or that the body could be segmented into higher and lower orders of importance.</p><p> 这使得对来自竞争治疗的同一个泥潭的医生没有吸引力，而是设法提升自己的专业人士，并非最不仅仅是通过排除其他做法。作为人类生理学的层次，划分，分为专业知识领土，嘴巴和那些在它上面的人被排除在外。美国牙科父亲的查尔斯哈里斯试图在1800年代中期将牙医融入医学院校，并拒绝。这甚至作为科学中的突破表明，腐烂的牙齿可能将感染的血液传递给大脑，以及如何像第二种空气一样如何穿过世界，破坏了健康可以分开的概念环境，或者身体可以分割为更高，更较低的重要性。</p><p> This division has had lasting, deleterious effects on the way we think of health, how we conceptualize care, and who deserves it. It’s why potentially life-saving dental treatments like extractions and root canals are often considered “cosmetic” by insurance companies. It’s also part of why people are often embarrassed and ashamed by the state of their teeth. Tooth pain is viewed more as a matter of personal failing than it is a matter of public health, which obscures the way systemic inequity keeps treatment away from the people who need it. As the writer Sarah Smarsh says: “Poor teeth, I knew, beget not just shame but more poorness: people with bad teeth have a harder time getting jobs and other opportunities. People without jobs are poor. Poor people can’t access dentistry—and so goes the cycle.”</p><p> 这司对我们想到健康的方式，我们如何概念化关怀，以及谁应该得到持续的。这就是为什么潜在的救生牙科治疗如提取和根运河，通常被保险公司视为“化妆品”。这也是为什么人们经常尴尬，而受到牙齿的状态。牙齿疼痛的视为更加个人失败的问题，这是一个公共卫生的问题，这掩盖了系统性不公平的方式让远离需要它的人。当作家莎拉·斯莫什说：“牙齿差，我知道，生物不只是羞耻，但更糟糕：牙齿坏的人有更难的工作和其他机会。没有工作的人很差。穷人无法访问牙科 - 所以循环。“</p><p> Physicians and dentists may not sit at the same table, but the diseases they treat do. The bodies we inhabit suffer for their division.</p><p> 医生和牙医可能不会坐在同一张桌子上，而是他们对待的疾病。我们居住的尸体受到他们的师。</p><p>  I am generally a risk averse person, because I’m at least partially convinced that I’m an idiot. When confronted with two conflicting pieces of information (when one Tripadvisor user says a Los Algodones dentist saved their teeth and another says they subjected them to hours of unnecessary pain, for instance), I tend to spend less time making sober appraisals than fearfully contemplating the perfect reality trap that allows facts to exist in the multiple.</p><p>  我一般是一个厌恶的人，因为我至少部分地相信我是个白痴。当面对两个冲突的信息时（当一个TripAdvisor用户说，LOS algodes牙医挽救了他们的牙齿，另一个人说他们让他们在几小时的时间不必要的痛苦，例如），我倾向于花费更少的时间使清醒的评估比可怕的评估完美的现实陷阱，允许在多个中存在事实。 </p><p> Days in Los Algodones were disorienting, with its hallucinatory specificity, the way it makes you imagine human teeth being swept out like barber’s clippings at the end of the workday. After I had visited as many dentists as I could, I would walk out of the central commercial district and into the residential neighbourhoods: quieter, sparser streets that had more of the desert backdrop leaking into them. Children played in dusty parks and stray dogs lay around, blinking into the sunlight. I took pictures of a stack of life-sized Spider-Man pinatas stacked in front of a storefront and ate a plate of lengua tacos.</p><p>LOS algodones的日子令人幻想，具有幻觉的特异性，这使您可以想象人类牙齿在工作日结束时像理发师的剪报一样扫除。在我被访问过的时候，我会走出中央商业区，进入住宅区：安静，有更多沙漠背景泄漏到它们中。孩子们在尘土飞扬的公园和流浪的狗旁边躺着，眨眼睛。我拍摄了一堆堆积在店面的堆积蜘蛛侠的照片，并吃了一盘Lengua炸玉米饼。</p><p> I walked back to Los Algodones three times. I picked dentists based on reviews found on forums and at random. Some were glitzy operations, with large staff and on-site hotels where patients could convalesce in the jacuzzi. Others were less familiar. The first dentist I visited was in a concrete bungalow painted with lucha libre wrestlers. Inside, wrestling masks hung from the walls, and the owner, an old man in a brown suit, dozed in his dentist’s chair. When he woke up, he sat me down and readied his tools. I scrutinized the diplomas on the wall, which I couldn’t read anyway. I explained to him the history of my teeth, and he nodded patiently, then made the universal gesture for “open up,” making a large O with his mouth and going  aaaahh. When he brought the circular mirror and the probing hook towards me, I flinched. I thought about how far from home I was. I tried to tell him, to reiterate: my teeth  hurt. They’re swollen and broken, and I was afraid some were turning grey, but most importantly, they fucking hurt. Hurt when I breathed winter air and ate certain foods. Sometimes they hurt so unpredictably that I woke my partner in the night, near-blind with pain. Please, I told the dentist, be careful.</p><p> 我走回Los algodones三次。我选择了基于在论坛和随机的审核的牙医。有些人是乐趣的运营，拥有大型员工和现场酒店，患者可以在按摩浴缸中进行康复。其他人不那么熟悉。我访问过的第一名牙医是在一个混凝土简易帆船上涂上了Lucha Libre Waltlers。里面，摔跤面具悬挂在墙上，主人，一个穿着棕色西装的老人，在他的牙医的椅子上发布了混思。当他醒来时，他坐下来，再次阅读他的工具。我在墙上仔细审查了文凭，无论如何我都无法阅读。我向他解释了牙齿的历史，他耐心地点头，然后使普遍的手势“开放”，用他的嘴巴制作一个大的o，然后去Aaaahh。当他带来圆形镜子和探测钩子时，我爆发了。我想到了我的家。我试图告诉他，重申：我的牙齿受伤了。他们肿了，破碎了，我害怕有些人转身灰色，但最重要的是，他们他妈的受伤了。当我呼吸冬季空气并吃某些食物时受伤。有时候他们伤害了如此不可预测，我夜间醒来，近乎盲目的痛苦。拜托，我告诉牙医，小心。</p><p> And he was. He found the ruined fillings and the cankered flesh, touched them but withdrew when I flinched. Then he tore a page out of a magazine and wrote down everything I would need to fix them. Extractions, roots canals, implants. Potentially a sinus lift, which is where the gums are peeled away and the bones of the jaw artificially grafted, millimetre by millimetre. This was essentially the same thing prescribed by dentists back home, only in this case he wrote down the prices as well, in neat columns like a receipt from the grocery store.</p><p> 他是。他发现了破败的馅料和腐烂的肉体，触动了他们，但是当我畏缩时撤回了。然后他撕掉了一个杂志的页面，并写下了我需要解决它们的一切。提取，根部运河，植入物。潜在的鼻窦升降机，它是牙龈剥离的地方，并且颌骨的骨骼是由毫米的毫米毫米。这与牙医返回家庭的基本上是同一件事，只有在这种情况下，他也在以这种情况下写下价格，在杂货店的收据中的整齐列中。</p><p> Walking back into the United States takes a lot longer than leaving it. During the peak season, the wait can take hours, as the tourist rush mixes with Mexican citizens who travel back and forth across the border to work on massive agricultural farms during the winter harvest. In line I checked estimates on the   U.S. Customs and Border Control’s official app and looked around at the others waiting, trying to spot evidence of bridge insertions and sinus lifts. When the border agent asked me if I had anything to declare, I imagined my future self splitting into a wide grin to display row upon row of pearly, industrially white teeth, fixed to my jaw with titanium composite screws.</p><p> 走回美国需要的时间比离开它更长。在旺季期间，等待可能需要几个小时，因为旅游匆匆与墨西哥公民混合在冬季收获期间在冬季收获期间在巨大的农业农场上班。在线我检查了美国海关和边境管制官方的官方应用程序的估计，并在其他等待中环顾四周，试图发现桥接插入和鼻窦升降机的证据。当边境代理人问我如果我有任何申报，我想象我的未来自我分裂成宽笑容，以在珍珠，工业洁白的牙齿行上展示排，用钛合金螺钉固定在我的下巴上。</p><p> Arriving back at the hotel at the end of the day, I began to notice something. It was there as I walked across the casino floor: a prickling in the air, and an electric current of risk. The chemical sense of chances both desperate and considered being taken, life savings and the bone white coins set into living flesh, all pushed forward onto the table with the immense desert at your back.</p><p> 在一天结束时抵达酒店，我开始注意到一些事情。在那里，我走过赌场地板：空中刺痛，风险的电流。绝望和考虑的化学意识既绝望和被认为是被拍摄的，生命节省和骨骼白色硬币被设为活肉体，所有人都向前推进到桌子上，背部左右。</p><p> But in the end, I didn’t let anyone fix my teeth in Molar City. Whatever feeling of wealth I possessed evaporated when it came time to put some money down. Gambling gives you a feeling of unaccountable wealth right up until the moment you actually place your bet, at which point you see the hard material kernel of your fate taken out of your hands. Sitting in my hotel room comparing prices, I wasn’t confident that I wouldn’t spend too much on the wrong thing. Less a gambler than an idiot. If anthropologists were to unearth my dental remains a thousand years hence, I wondered what conclusions my teeth might contribute to: a snapshot of a rapaciously commodified healthcare system? Evidence of a needless bifurcation in the care of a whole self? Errata from the </p><p> 但最终，我没有让任何人在臼齿城里修理我的牙齿。无论我在时间下降的时候，我所拥有的财富感觉如何蒸发。赌博给你一种不负责任的财富的感觉，直到你实际地放置你的赌注，那么你看到你的命运的硬质材料内核从你的手中取出。坐在我的酒店房间比较价格，我并不相信我不会在错误的事情上花太多。较少的赌徒而不是白痴。如果人类学家在牙科学家遗留留下千年之后，我想知道我的牙齿可能有贡献什么：冒劣商品的医疗保健系统的快照吗？证据表明，在整个自我的照顾中的不必要分叉？勘误表来自</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://hazlitt.net/longreads/molar-city">https://hazlitt.net/longreads/molar-city</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/臼齿/">#臼齿</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/molar/">#molar</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/牙齿/">#牙齿</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
