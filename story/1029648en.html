It’s obviously a great exit for everyone associated with Clover, but you’ll have to forgive me if I’m a bit befuddled that a 3-star Medicare Advantage plan with an MLR of 98.8% in 2019 and ~57,000 lives is somehow being valued at $3.7 billion (roughly equaling $65k per life covered). Granted, building up a Medicare Advantage plan to 57,000 lives is no easy feat. But a $3.7 billion valuation?</p><p>周二，Medicare Advantage保险初创公司之一Coverer宣布，将通过Facebook的Chaath Palihapitiya拥有的SPAC上市-估值37亿美元。对于与三叶草有关联的每个人来说，这显然是一个很好的退出，但如果我有点困惑的话，请原谅我，一个2019年MLR为98.8%、生命约为5.7万人的三星级医疗保险优势计划不知何故估值为37亿美元(大致相当于每个生命覆盖6.5万美元)。诚然，将医疗保险优势计划建立到5.7万人的生命并非易事。但是37亿美元的估值呢？</p><p> Th e valuation just doesn’t make a ton of sense if you’re just looking at this as a Medicare Advantage insurance company. Of course, Clover isn’t just being pitched as an MA insurer, it’s being pitched as a technology company that’s going to fix the healthcare space. A big part of the growth story discussed in the investor presentation, even though it’s not baked into the financials yet, is about the tech platform — the Clover Assistant.</p><p>如果你只把它看作是一家医疗保险优势保险公司，那么这个估值就没有多大意义。当然，三叶草不仅仅是一家并购保险公司，它还被定位为一家将修复医疗领域的技术公司。在投资者演示中讨论的增长故事中，很大一部分是关于科技平台-三叶草助手的，尽管它还没有纳入金融数据。</p><p> It doesn’t help any of this that the investor deck could best be described as a hot mess. There’s very little detail on the business, and details that are there are at best confusing to understand.  Here’s a link to the investor presentation.</p><p>投资者可以说是一团乱七八糟的东西，这对这一切都没有任何帮助。关于这项业务的细节很少，而且这些细节充其量也是令人费解的。以下是投资者演示文稿的链接。</p><p> Clover certainly doesn’t describe itself as two different businesses, but the valuation certainly seems to imply it. I’d have hoped that the investor presentation would have provided a bit more confidence that Clover is worth the astronomical valuation. But instead, the presentation seems to mislead the reader as to the current state of the business. More on this below. All of this has me yearning for the rigor of a traditional S-1 and IPO process.</p><p>三叶草当然没有将自己描述为两个不同的企业，但估值似乎肯定暗示了这一点。我原本希望，投资者的陈述会让人们更有信心，认为三叶草的估值值得上天文数字。但相反，演示文稿似乎误导了读者，让他们无法了解企业的现状。下面是关于这一点的更多信息。所有这些都让我向往传统S-1和IPO流程的严谨。</p><p> As I’ve perused the deck, I’ve reached the conclusion that Clover is really pitching two separate businesses, with the second one driving the valuation upside:</p><p>当我仔细阅读资料时，我得出的结论是，克洛弗实际上是在推销两项不同的业务，第二项业务推动了估值的上升：</p><p>  Let’s start digging into the business, first with some general context / background, and then going into the two seemingly separate parts of the business — the MA plan and the tech platform.</p><p>让我们开始深入研究业务，首先了解一些大致的背景/背景，然后进入业务的两个看似独立的部分-并购计划和技术平台。</p><p>  Beyond the dynamics of each part of the business that I’ll get into below, there are some worrying dynamics around this deal as a general context for the business. I’m a bit leery about this SPAC for a few reasons:</p><p>除了我将在下面介绍的每个业务部分的动态之外，围绕这笔交易作为业务的总体背景，还有一些令人担忧的动态。我对这个SPAC有点怀疑，原因有几个：</p><p> In Vivek Garipalli, Clover’s CEO, you have someone who has legislators in his home state poking around an investigation into shenanigans related to him and others while they received over  $150 million in management fees running Carepoint Health, the group of hospitals he ran prior to starting Clover. His legacy at Carepoint, by the way, was purchasing it out of bankruptcy and turning it around by going out of network with insurers and jacking up prices to turn a profit. In 2013  one of his hospitals was the most expensive in the country. Gross.</p><p>在克洛弗的首席执行官维韦克·加里帕利(Vivek Garipalli)身上，有人让他家乡的议员们对与他和其他人有关的恶作剧进行调查，同时他们获得了超过1.5亿美元的管理费，经营着他在创办克洛弗之前经营的Carepoint Health医院集团。顺便说一句，他在Carepoint留下的遗产是将其从破产中收购出来，并通过与保险公司脱离网络并提高价格来盈利来扭转局面。2013年，他的一家医院是全国最昂贵的医院之一。恶心。</p><p> In Palihapitiya, you have a guy taking full advantage of the zero interest rate environment and launching SPACs left and right. He is apparently launching a personal collection of 26 SPACs, which he is labeling IPOA to IPOZ. Clover, being the third of his 26 SPACs has earned the moniker of  is IPOC. I am sure he is going to make a whole lot of money off his SPACs, but I’m a bit skeptical about the general societal value of whats going on here. Palihapitiya, fresh off his IPOC / Clover investor presentation show (more on that below)  is already on to SPACs IPOD, IPOE, and IPOF. That leaves him twenty more SPACs to get through after that. He gets to benefit from taking companies public without the diligence of a traditional IPO process — or really any process at all — but where is the diligence and rigor on these investments for the general investor? His presentation on Clover is *at best* misleading, as we’ll get to below. Yet… he waves his magic wand and this all of a sudden Clover is worth $3.7 billion because the Virgin Galactic SPAC worked out?</p><p>在Palihapitiya，有一个人充分利用了零利率环境，左右推出了SPAC。显然，他正在推出一个由26个SPAC组成的个人收藏，他将这些SPAC贴上了IPOA的标签，将其命名为IPOZ。克洛弗是他26个SPAC中的第三个，赢得了IS IPOC的绰号。我确信他将从他的SPAC中赚到一大笔钱，但我对这里正在发生的事情的总体社会价值持怀疑态度。帕里哈皮蒂亚刚刚参加完他的IPOC/三叶草投资者演示秀(更多信息见下文)，他已经开始在SPAC的iPod、IPOE和IPOF上做客了。在那之后，他还有二十个SPAC要通过。他可以从公司上市中受益，而不需要传统IPO过程的勤奋-或者实际上任何过程-但对于普通投资者来说，这些投资的勤奋和严谨在哪里？他关于三叶草的陈述“充其量”是误导性的，我们将在下面讨论。然而…。他挥舞着魔杖，因为维珍银河空间委员会(Virgin Galaxy SPAC)成功了，这个三叶草突然价值37亿美元？</p><p> In Clover, you have a company that has a checkered past and widely missed the mark a number of times, including being fined by CMS for  misleading marketing practices,  pissing off its customers, and finally acknowledging it needed to hire more healthcare folks while  laying off 25% of staff in 2019.</p><p>在三叶草，你会发现一家公司的历史参差不齐，而且多次严重失误，包括因误导营销行为而被CMS罚款，激怒客户，最后承认需要雇佣更多的医疗保健人员，同时在2019年裁员25%。</p><p> Clover, mind you, was pitching early on (presumably 2015) that it would have  65,000 Medicare Advantage members and a gross margin of 20% back in 2017. It has 57,000 MA members today, in 2020. It’s gross margin was 2.5% in 2019. I recognize that every startup is going to have its fair share of hard moments and you can’t always expect them to hit every project or number (and frankly getting to 57k MA members is a huge accomplishment for a lot of folks at Clover, who I’m sure have worked really hard to get Clover to this point). But… this seems like a bit more than your typical set of startup issues here. There is a pattern of behavior.</p><p>请注意，三叶草在很早(估计是2015年)就提出，它将在2017年拥有6.5万名联邦医疗保险优势会员，毛利率为20%。到2020年，它现在有5.7万名MA会员。它在2019年的毛利率为2.5%。我认识到，每一家初创公司都会有相当一部分的艰难时刻，你不能总是指望他们能成功完成每个项目或数字(坦率地说，对于克洛弗的许多人来说，拥有57000名MA会员是一个巨大的成就，我相信他们为了让克洛弗走到这一步真的很努力)。但是…。这似乎比你这里典型的创业问题要多一点。这是一种行为模式。</p><p>  Adding to the sense of chicanery is that Palihapitiya’s portion of the investor presentation felt a bit like an imaginary episode of Silicon Valley where Erlich Bachman gave a TEDTalk on why healthcare is so screwed up in this country. If you aren’t aware already that healthcare is screwed up, it’s worth checking out. But if you already are aware that healthcare is screwed up… I’d just go ahead and skip the first 64 pages of the presentation. The slides are full of brilliant nonsense like slide #59, pasted below, which depicts why Palihapitiya is excited about Clover. It’s almost as though this dude ran growth at Facebook or something.</p><p>让人感到更具欺骗感的是，帕里哈皮蒂亚在投资者演示中的部分感觉有点像硅谷虚构的一集，埃利希·巴赫曼(Erlich Bachman)在TED演讲中讲述了为什么这个国家的医疗保健如此糟糕。如果你还没有意识到医疗保健被搞砸了，那就值得一查。但是如果你已经意识到医疗保健搞砸了，…。我只想跳过演示文稿的前64页。幻灯片充满了精彩的胡言乱语，就像下面贴的第59张幻灯片，它描述了为什么帕里哈皮蒂亚对三叶草感到兴奋。这几乎就像是这个家伙在Facebook或其他什么地方经营增长。</p><p>  Soooo… this is the type of in depth analysis that gets a company public these days? Ok sweet deal I’m in!</p><p>Soooo…。这就是如今让一家公司上市的那种深度分析吗？好的，甜蜜的交易，我加入！</p><p> Palihapitiya, to his credit, also tweeted a one-pager on his investment thesis for the deal, which is quite nice in it’s simplicity. Healthcare Industry = screwed up. Awesome Clover Tech = the solution. MA = big market. Clover = GROWTH * GROWTH * GROWTH. It’s worth reading if you’re interested in the thesis here.</p><p>值得称赞的是，帕里哈皮蒂亚还在推特上用一页纸介绍了他对这笔交易的投资论点，这一点很简单。医疗保健行业=搞砸了。了不起的三叶草科技=解决方案。MA=大市场。三叶草=增长*增长*增长。如果你对这里的论文感兴趣，这本书值得一读。</p><p>  All of this context makes me a little nervous about this deal and whats really going on behind the scenes here. Not to say that Clover can’t still be a great company despite some of the issues articulated above. But, I’d want to see some proof of that in the investor presentation before buying in. Unfortunately, this is where things seem to fall apart. Let’s check out Clover the Medicare Advantage insurance startup…</p><p>所有这些背景让我对这笔交易以及这里幕后的真实情况感到有点紧张。这并不是说，尽管存在上述一些问题，三叶草仍不能成为一家伟大的公司。但是，在买入之前，我希望在投资者演示中看到一些这一点的证据。不幸的是，这似乎是事情分崩离析的地方。让我们来看看三叶草，医疗保险优势保险初创公司…</p><p>  Now we’re through the general context setting, let’s take a look at the mechanics of Clover’s core business as a Medicare Advantage plan.</p><p>现在我们已经完成了一般的上下文设置，让我们来看看作为联邦医疗保险优势计划的三叶草核心业务的机制。</p><p>  Clover is a  3 Star Medicare Advantage plan. For context… while it technically is defined as an ‘average’ rating, that is not a good rating. If you worked at UHG and were in charge of a 3 Star plan I’m fairly certain that it would get you fired for gross incompetence. (I’m… only partly joking. You’d definitely get fired.).  For reference, of the 410 entities that have MA contracts for 2020, 210 of them are at least 4 Stars, and 360 had at least 3.5 Stars. That means that Clover is in the bottom 13% of all Medicare Advantage plans on its Star rating, despite all of the cool AI technology. Perhaps it’s not surprising that Clover’s Star rating is not mentioned in the investor deck once. Ohhhhhh right, I forgot it’s a technology company, not an insurance company and AI algorithms will figure out how to fix that byzantine healthcare stuff later. No need to worry.</p><p>三叶草是一项三星级医疗保险优势计划。对于上下文…。虽然从技术上讲，它被定义为“平均”评级，但这并不是一个好的评级。如果你在UHG工作，并负责一个三星级计划，我相当肯定这会让你因为严重的无能而被解雇。)我是…。只是半开玩笑而已。你肯定会被炒鱿鱼的。)。作为参考，在410家签订了2020年MA合同的实体中，210家至少是4星，360家至少有3.5星。这意味着三叶草在所有医疗保险优势计划的星级评级中排名垫底13%，尽管有所有酷的人工智能技术。或许，三叶草的星级评级没有一次在投资者甲板上被提及也就不足为奇了。哦，对了，我忘了这是一家科技公司，而不是一家保险公司，人工智能算法稍后会弄清楚如何解决拜占庭式的医疗保健问题。不用担心。</p><p> For those who aren’t aware, the Star rating is a  pretty enormous deal for insurers as it is basically the driving force behind Medicare Advantage plan profitability. You have a good Star rating, you’re profitable. You have a bad Star rating, you’re not profitable. This is in large part because Medicare gives you pretty sizable bonus payments if you’re at 4 Stars or above as a plan.  As this article suggests, an increase from 3 to 4 Stars can increase a plans revenue by ~15% as well as a 8% — 12% increase in enrollment. That… seems important, no? Maybe you should at least mention your plans to improve your Star rating in your investor deck?</p><p>对于那些没有意识到的人来说，星级评级对保险公司来说是一笔相当巨大的交易，因为它基本上是医疗保险优势计划盈利能力背后的驱动力。你有很好的星级评级，你是有利可图的。你的星级很差，你不赚钱。这在很大程度上是因为，如果你是四星级或以上的计划，医疗保险会给你相当大的奖金支付。正如本文所建议的，从三星级增加到四星级可以使计划收入增加~15%，注册人数增加8%-12%。那个…。看起来很重要，不是吗？也许你至少应该在你的投资者甲板上提到你提高星级评级的计划？</p><p>  Referenced a few times in the investor presentation and by Clover folks is that Clover is the “ fastest growing Medicare Advantage plan in the US (w/ at least 50K members)”. Leaving aside the mathematical game they’re playing to give Clover an advantage by defining the denominator as their membership number and no less (i.e. it excludes Devoted which had a significantly higher growth rate as it grew roughly the same number of members as Clover on a significantly lower base), let’s take a look at what Clover’s membership growth has looked like over time versus other Medicare Advantage startups:</p><p>在投资者报告中和三叶草人士多次提到的是，三叶草是“美国增长最快的联邦医疗保险优势计划(拥有至少50K会员)”。抛开他们正在玩的数学游戏，通过将分母定义为会员数量而不是更少(即不包括增长率明显高于三叶草的会员数量)，让我们来看看一段时间以来，与其他Medicare Advantage初创公司相比，三叶草的会员数量增长情况：</p><p>  Clover certainly does demonstrate solid year over year growth rates. And to be sure, growing in Medicare Advantage markets is really hard, as most healthcare companies find out.  This blog post covers well the challenges of growth in the Medicare Advantage market for the startups in the space. It is not easy to demonstrate GROWTH * GROWTH * GROWTH in the space.</p><p>三叶草确实表现出了稳健的同比增长率。可以肯定的是，正如大多数医疗保健公司所发现的那样，在医疗保险优势市场增长真的很难。这篇博客文章很好地报道了医疗保险优势市场增长给该领域的初创企业带来的挑战。要在空间中展示增长*增长*增长并非易事。</p><p> But at the same time, Clover’s growth seems pretty unremarkable compared to the other startups in the space. For instance Clover and Devoted both grew ~15k members between 2019 and 2020. And there’s not necessarily any problem with that — Clover is in good company with the companies on that list. But what I do take issue with is slides like this one below from Palihapitiya, referring to Clover’s growth rate as over double it’s next nine nearest competitors on average. Again, this all seems a bit disingenuous at best.</p><p>但与此同时，与该领域的其他初创公司相比，克洛弗的增长似乎相当平淡无奇。例如，三叶草和敬业在2019年至2020年间都增加了约1.5万名会员。这不一定有什么问题--三叶草和榜单上的公司关系很好。但我不同意的是下面这张来自Palihapitiya的幻灯片，指的是三叶草的增长率是紧随其后的9个竞争对手的平均增长率的两倍多。再说一次，这一切充其量看起来有点不真诚。</p><p>  I’m really curious what Clover thinks its next nine competitors are here? It’d be helpful if Palihapitiya put some labels on these things.</p><p>我真的很好奇，三叶草认为它接下来的九个竞争者会在这里吗？如果帕里哈皮蒂亚给这些东西贴上标签会很有帮助。</p><p>  Clover presents a lot of numbers related to market share and growth that are misleading regarding its position in the Medicare Advantage market. For instance, check out slide 8 (slide 73 overall), which says in the title that Clover is the fastest growing MA plan in the US and talks about Clover’s market share being 25%, with the caveat that it’s only in established counties. Note also that Palihapitiya covered the market share data as well in slide 37, without any caveat about the 25% market share only in ‘established counties’.</p><p>三叶草提供了许多与市场份额和增长相关的数字，这些数字在其在医疗保险优势市场的地位方面具有误导性。例如，看一下幻灯片8(整个幻灯片73)，标题中说三叶草是美国增长最快的并购计划，并谈到三叶草的市场份额为25%，并警告说，这只在老牌县。还要注意的是，Palihapitiya在幻灯片37中也涵盖了市场份额数据，没有任何关于只有“老牌县”的25%市场份额的警告。</p><p>  If you look at that slide and think to yourself, jeez, Clover has an awesome business in the MA space, I wouldn’t blame you! 25% is an incredible market share! You’re in the neighborhood of UHC market penetration in that territory. That is really good. But then you check out the footnote and see that it’s only in counties that Clover has over 500 members… which I suppose has the benefit of being one way that you can look at market share? But if you look across Clover’s entire book of business… the market share story seems, well, a little bit different:</p><p>如果你看着那张幻灯片，心里想，天哪，三叶草在并购领域有一笔了不起的生意，我不会怪你！25%的市场份额令人难以置信！你们正处在那个地区UHC市场渗透率的附近。那真的很不错。但是，如果你看一下脚注，你会发现只有在各县，克洛弗才有超过500000名…会员。我想这有一个好处，那就是你可以用一种方式来看待市场份额？但如果你翻阅克洛弗的整本商业书籍，…。市场份额的故事似乎，嗯，有点不同：</p><p>  Clover hasn’t been able to reach 1,000 members in a single state outside of New Jersey. It has sub 1% marketshare in all of the states it is in aside from New Jersey, where it has 11.0% market share, and Georgia, where it has 2.4% market share. For a company that is supposedly in the GROWTH * GROWTH * GROWTH club, this seems a bit… underwhelming?</p><p>克洛弗在新泽西州以外的任何一个州都无法联系到1000名会员。除了新泽西州和佐治亚州外，它在所有州的市场份额都不到1%，新泽西州和佐治亚州的市场份额分别为11.0%和2.4%。对于一家理应处于增长*增长*增长俱乐部的公司来说，这似乎有点…。平淡无奇？</p><p> Even in New Jersey, Clover’s stronghold, it appears they’ve hit 25% market share in only one county—Hudson. That seems awfully different than their claims in the investor presentation. They’re above 20% market share in two additional counties, Atlantic and Passaic. Oh and by the way, those hospitals that Garipalli owned prior to Clover? Located in Hudson County.</p><p>即使是在克洛弗的大本营新泽西州，他们似乎也只在一个县-哈德逊-达到了25%的市场份额。这似乎与他们在投资者演示中的说法大相径庭。他们在另外两个县大西洋和帕塞伊克的市场占有率超过20%。哦，顺便问一下，加里帕利在克洛弗之前拥有的那些医院？位于哈德逊县。</p><p> Prior to 2016 it appears as though Garipalli was testing out Clover inside of CarePoint. While Clover  was citing almost 7,200 members in 2015, while Clover’s insurance license wasn’t in the Medicare Advantage enrollment files in 2015. CarePoint Insurance Company, however, was in the MA enrollment files (for 2013–2015), and had right around 7,200 members in 2015. In 2016, CarePoint didn’t have any members. Garipalli seems to have built Clover on the back of CarePoint, making it a provider-sponsored plan of sorts in the New Jersey area. So it actually makes a ton of sense that they’re seeing a relatively good market share in Hudson — it is significantly easier to get people to enroll in MA plans when you have a friendly provider handy (note: this comes back into play when you think about Clover’s partnership with Walmart… it is one thing that could potentially kickstart some serious growth for them).</p><p>在2016年之前，加里帕利似乎是在CarePoint内部测试三叶草。虽然三叶草在2015年引用了近7200名会员，而三叶草的保险执照在2015年没有出现在联邦医疗保险优势的登记文件中。然而，CarePoint保险公司在MA注册文件中(2013-2015年)，2015年大约有7200名会员。2016年，CarePoint没有任何会员。Garipalli似乎在CarePoint的支持下建立了三叶草，使其成为新泽西地区提供商赞助的某种计划。因此，他们在哈德逊看到了相对较好的市场份额，这实际上很有道理-当你手头有一个友好的供应商时，让人们注册MA计划要容易得多(注：当你考虑到克洛弗与沃尔玛…的合作伙伴关系时，这一点又开始发挥作用了。这是一件可能会为他们带来一些严重增长的事情)。</p><p> Clover had 56,747 total members in July 2020 across two insurance licenses (Clover HMO of New Jersey and Clover Insurance Company), with 54,867 of those members in New Jersey. In total, the counties where Clover had members had a total of 1,172,952 Medicare Advantage enrollees, meaning Clover’s overall market share is sub 5% across all of its markets. Let’s look at its market share even in New Jersey counties:</p><p>截至2020年7月，三叶草共有56,747名会员，涉及两个保险牌照(新泽西州的三叶草HMO和三叶草保险公司)，其中54,867名会员在新泽西州。总体而言，三叶草拥有会员的县总共有1172,952名联邦医疗保险优势(Medicare Advantage)参与者，这意味着三叶草在所有市场的总市场份额不到5%。让我们看看它在新泽西州各县的市场份额：</p><p>  For all the talk about the advantages of technology driving growth and scale… it seems a bit worrisome to see how hard it has been for Clover to scale beyond a handful of counties in New Jersey. Check out the market penetration they have in some other metro areas that they’re offering product they’re in:</p><p>尽管所有人都在谈论技术推动增长和规模…的优势。看到克洛弗想要超越新泽西州几个县的规模有多难，似乎有点令人担忧。看看他们在其他一些大都会地区的市场渗透率，他们正在提供他们所在的产品：</p><p>  That’s… not great. Further confusing all of this is this slide below arguing that Clover has 48% market share in Hudson, 36% in Cumberland, and 24% in Bergen. Huh? As best I can tell that is demonstrably false given the CMS data above. Hudson is the highest market share at 29%, Cumberland and Bergen are 14%.</p><p>那是…。不太好。更让人困惑的是下面这张幻灯片，理由是三叶草在哈德逊的市场份额为48%，在坎伯兰的市场份额为36%，在卑尔根的市场份额为24%。哈?。根据上面的CMS数据，我可以断定这是明显错误的。哈德逊的市场份额最高，为29%，坎伯兰和卑尔根为14%。</p><p>  I am guessing that Clover is again pulling some slight of hand and referencing market capture — their share of net new members who are signing up for Medicare Advantage plans (Palihapitiya makes a comment along these lines on slide 36). Still… seems like they’re intentionally trying to cause confusion and make their market share rates look better than they really are here.</p><p>我猜三叶草又在开玩笑了，并提到了市场占有率-他们在签约联邦医疗保险优势计划的净新会员中所占的份额(Palihapitiya在幻灯片36上沿着这些路线发表了评论)。仍然是…。看起来他们是故意想制造混乱，让他们的市场占有率看起来比实际情况要好。</p><p> Also, if you look at the market share chart on the left side of the page on Slide 90 above, look at Year 2. Clover is saying all of those counties are above 10% in year 2. This is their ‘scalable playbook’, yes? **Goes and checks year 2 market share in markets outside of NJ in the charts above** Oh wait, the markets where they’re in year 2 of membership they have sub 1% marketshare. Turns out that scalable playbook seems like it still is yet to be written.</p><p>另外，如果你看上面幻灯片90页左侧的市场份额图表，看看第二年。克洛弗说，所有这些国家在第二年的市场份额都在10%以上。这是他们的“可扩展策略”，对吗？**去上面的图表中检查新泽西州以外的市场第二年的市场份额**哦，等等，他们加入第二年的市场份额不到1%。事实证明，可伸缩的剧本似乎还没有写出来。</p><p> I believe ‘woof’ is the technical term for the current state of Clover’s market shares in new markets. It highlights how hard it is to acquire members in the Medicare Advantage market. This doesn’t strike me as the demand generation you’d see if Clover were akin to Tesla disrupting the car industry. It strikes me as the demand generation of a regional provider-sponsored plan that is trying to scale to new markets where it has no brand clout. Clover sounds much more like a regional Medicare Advantage plan in New Jersey at this point than a game changing technology company that’s in the GROWTH * GROWTH * GROWTH club.</p><p>我相信“WOF”是技术术语，指的是三叶草在新市场的市场份额现状。它突显了在医疗保险优势市场获得会员是多么困难。如果三叶草类似于特斯拉(Tesla)颠覆汽车业，你会发现这并不是你会看到的需求一代。在我看来，这是一个地区性供应商赞助的计划的需求产生，该计划正试图扩展到它没有品牌影响力的新市场。在这一点上，三叶草听起来更像是新泽西州的地区性医疗保险优势计划，而不是一家处于增长*增长*增长俱乐部的改变游戏规则的技术公司。</p><p> To be clear, you can build a really, really nice business in the Medicare Advantage space without needing to make the claims that Clover is in the investor presentation. It turns out that even if you’re at 1% market share, it equates to hundreds of millions of revenue. You’ve just gotta manage the medical spend on that population effectively.</p><p>需要明确的是，你可以在联邦医疗保险优势领域建立一个非常非常好的业务，而不需要声称三叶草在投资者演示文稿中。事实证明，即使你的市场占有率为1%，也相当于数亿美元的收入。你只需要有效地管理这部分人群的医疗支出就行了。</p><p>  Somewhere in Minneapolis, the Bright Health team has gotta be laughing all the way to the bank on their Brand New Day acquisition earlier this year. Brand New Day is a California-centric Medicare Advantage plan with a 3.5 star Medicare Advantage plan (not perfect, but better than 3!) and has ~43,000 lives. Look at the growth trajectories of Brand New Day and Clover above and tell me you see a meaningful difference there — I don’t personally. You just have one high flying VC-backed technology startup and one sleepy old school healthcare company started in the 1980s, but got into the MA space at the same time as Clover.</p><p>在明尼阿波利斯的某个地方，光明健康团队在今年早些时候的品牌新年收购中肯定一直在笑着去银行。全新一天是一个以加州为中心的联邦医疗保险优势计划，拥有3.5星级的医疗保险优势计划(不是完美的，但比3星级要好！)。拥有约43,000条生命。看看上面的品牌新日(Brand New Day)和三叶草的增长轨迹，告诉我你看到了一个有意义的不同--我个人没有看到。你只有一家雄心勃勃的风投支持的技术初创公司和一家昏昏欲睡的老式学校医疗保健公司，它们成立于20世纪80年代，但与克洛弗同时进入并购领域。</p><p> Brand New Day, with its 43,000 members, is probably doing somewhere on the order of $430 million of revenue this year (43k members x $1k in premium per year). If they’re managing costs well, it certainly could be profitable on that book of business, and at the very least likely is not losing $200 million+ per year.</p><p>拥有4.3万名会员的品牌新一天今年的收入可能在4.3亿美元左右(43000名会员x每年1000美元的保费)。如果他们能很好地管理成本，这笔业务当然可以盈利，而且至少每年不会亏损2亿美元以上。</p><p> Given the Brand New Day acquisition was  announced about a month after  Bright raised $635 million, lets just go ahead and assume that Bright used all of the capital they raised to acquire Brand New Day (it doesn’t seem like it could have been any more than that or we would have heard about it in another press release). If anything that feels like the highest amount it could have been.</p><p>鉴于收购Brand New Day的消息是在Bright筹集6.35亿美元约一个月后宣布的，那么我们就假设Bright用他们筹集的所有资金收购了Brand New Day(看起来不可能超过这个数字，否则我们就会在另一份新闻稿中听说这件事)。如果有任何感觉像是最高金额的话。</p><p> So, if you assume that Bright did pay a purchase price of $635 million, that would mean Bright paid ~$14,600 per Brand New Day member. This compares to Clover’s current valuation of… ~$65,000 per member. That strikes me as a particularly large difference, particularly while Clover is losing over $200 million a year. That tech platform sure is being valued pretty highly!</p><p>所以，如果你假设光明支付了6.35亿美元的购买价格，那就意味着光明为每个品牌新一天的会员支付了大约14,600美元。这与三叶草目前对…的估值形成了鲜明对比。每名会员约65,000美元。这给我留下了特别大的不同，特别是在三叶草每年亏损超过2亿美元的情况下。那个技术平台肯定很受重视！</p><p> $635 million still seems like it’d be a great financial outcome for Brand New Day and the team there, although not quite the venture scale unicorn VC-backed startups feel the pressure to be. It also seems like a significantly more reasonably valued acquisition by Bright than by the SPAC — the difference in valuation per member is insane. Maybe we’re all just really good negotiators up here in Minneapolis or something.</p><p>对于Brand New Day和团队来说，6.35亿美元似乎仍然是一个很好的财务结果，尽管没有独角兽风险投资支持的初创公司感到的压力那么大。与SPAC相比，Bright的收购估值似乎也要合理得多--每个成员的估值差异简直是疯了。也许我们都是明尼阿波利斯或其他地方的优秀谈判者。</p><p>  Clover spends a lot of time in its slides breaking down new members vs returning members, as they are significantly more profitable on returning members, which isn’t entirely surprising. Check out this slide on the financial breakdown between the two — note the revenue difference between year 1 and future years, which is a coy reference to the benefits of risk adjustment. Most notable is the wide gap in MCR. It drops from 95% — 105% in Year 1 to 70% — 85% for retained members.</p><p>三叶草在其幻灯片中花费了大量时间来分析新会员和回归会员，因为他们对回归会员的利润明显更高，这并不完全令人惊讶。看看这张关于两者之间的财务细目的幻灯片-注意第一年和未来几年的收入差异，这是对风险调整好处的含糊其辞的引用。最值得注意的是MCR的巨大差距。留守会员的比例从第一年的95%-105%下降到70%-85%。</p><p>  Now, the 70% — 85% would be a great MCR number for Clover’s retained members… what evidence do they give to back up that claim? Turns out there’s next to nothing. Check out slide 99, which shows their ‘Clover Assistant Returning Member MCR’ at 89% in 2019. So… last year the MCR was 89% for Returning Members, but yet somehow Clover is going to get that to 70% — 85% for that same population? Ok.</p><p>现在，对于三叶草的保留会员…来说，70%-85%将是一个很好的MCR值。他们提供了什么证据来支持这一说法？结果发现这里几乎什么都没有。看看幻灯片99，上面显示他们的“三叶草助理回归会员”在2019年的MCR为89%。所以…。去年，回归成员的MCR是89%，但克洛弗不知何故会将同样人口的MCR提高到70%-85%？好的。</p><p>  Clover again generally displays some impressive sleight of hand with numbers like MCR throughout the deck. Their attempt to compare Q1 2020 data to 2019 full year data in the chart above is really deft, and obviously shows a nice decline from 89% to 82%. 82% would be pretty good for a full year, but the only issue with that analysis is that MLRs are always lowest in Q1 and generally go up throughout the year, with the highest being in Q4. Why not compare Q1 2019 to Q1 2020, Clover folks? Not exactly confidence inspiring. Maybe MCR will indeed come in at 83% for the year as Clover is predicting, which would be excellent — and given the year we’ve had with a pandemic, who knows! The data doesn’t exactly support it at this point though.</p><p>三叶草又一次展示了一些令人印象深刻的手势，整个甲板上都有像MCR这样的数字。他们试图将2020年第一季度的数据与上图中的2019年全年数据进行比较，这一尝试真的很巧妙，显然显示出从89%到82%的良好下降。82%对于全年来说是相当不错的，但这一分析的唯一问题是，MLR总是在第一季度最低，通常全年都会上升，最高的是在第四季度。为什么不将2019年第一季度与2020年第一季度进行比较，三叶草的朋友们？并不是很有信心。也许MCR真的会像克洛弗预测的那样今年达到83%，这将是非常好的-考虑到我们经历了大流行的一年，谁知道呢！不过，在这一点上，数据并不完全支持这一点。</p><p>  Clover only shares two years of historical financials in the slide deck, but those years aren’t pretty. Clover’s MCR for 2019 was 98.8% and 2018 was 97.1%. The company suffered net losses of $364 million in 2019 and $202 million in 2018. Note that  according to reports, Clover lost $34 million in 2016 and $5 million in 2015. This is not exactly a confidence inspiring image.</p><p>克洛弗在幻灯片中只分享了两年的历史金融数据，但这些年并不美好。三叶草2019年的MCR为98.8%，2018年为97.1%。该公司2019年净亏损3.64亿美元，2018年净亏损2.02亿美元。注意，据报道，三叶草2016年亏损3400万美元，2015年亏损500万美元。这并不完全是一张鼓舞信心的图片。</p><p>    It only has meaningful marketshare in a handful of counties where its CEO used to own hospitals and started the plan as part of the hospitals</p><p>它只在少数几个县拥有有意义的市场份额，在这些县，它的首席执行官曾经拥有医院，并将该计划作为医院的一部分开始实施。</p><p>   It is hemorrhaging cash, with over $200 million in losses each of the last two years</p><p>它正在大量流失现金，在过去的两年里每年都有超过2亿美元的损失。</p><p>  Clover’s Medicare Advantage plan feels like it is sinking and needs to start bailing water. No wonder they are placing so much weight on the pivot to Clover Assistant as a PCP enablement platform. On to that!</p><p>三叶草的联邦医疗保险优势计划感觉到它正在下沉，需要开始捞水了。难怪他们如此重视将三叶草助手作为PCP支持平台。去查那件事！</p><p>  Throughout the investor presentation Clover and Pa</p><p>在整个投资者演示文稿中，克洛弗和佩奇</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@olearykm/a-review-of-the-clover-spac-6a22d000afdb">https://medium.com/@olearykm/a-review-of-the-clover-spac-6a22d000afdb</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/空间/">#空间</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/clover/">#clover</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/三叶草/">#三叶草</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
