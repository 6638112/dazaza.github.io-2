The campaign also included leaders from Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, United Airlines, SkyWest Airlines and Southwest Airlines — all with their hands extended. The flight attendant and pilot unions were also part of the lobbying.</p><p> 他并不孤单。该活动还包括来自阿拉斯加航空公司，Alligiant Air，Delta Air Lines，Frontier Airlines，夏威夷航空公司，吊桥航空公司，联合航空公司，Skywest航空公司和西南航空公司的领导者 - 所有人都延伸。航班服务员和试点工会也是游说的一部分。</p><p> A year later, as the stock market cruises to new heights, questions should be asked about the $50 billion in grants that were used to prop up the  airline industry. Was it worth it? And was it necessary?</p><p> 一年后，随着股市巡航到新的高度，应当询问赔偿金的赠款500亿美元的问题。它值得吗？有必要吗？</p><p> The good news is that the rescue money likely saved as many as 75,000 jobs, most remaining at full pay. And that money also kept the airlines from filing for bankruptcy, and in a position to ferry passengers all over the country to jump start economic growth as the health crisis subsides.</p><p> 好消息是，救援人数可能会节省多达75,000个就业机会，最省略了全额薪酬。并且这笔资金也将航空公司归还破产，并在全国各地渡轮乘客乘坐乘客，以恢复健康危机消退。</p><p> The bad news is that it is also likely that taxpayers massively overpaid: The original grant of $25 billion in April meant that each of the 75,000 jobs saved cost the equivalent of more than $300,000. And with each additional round of bailout money, that price has grown.</p><p> 坏消息是，纳税人也很可能超付：4月份的原始授予250亿美元的意思是，75,000个就业机会中的每一个都节省了相当于超过300,000美元的成本。随着每一轮救助金钱，价格已经成长。</p><p> The truth is that shareholders of the airlines have been the biggest beneficiaries. That includes airline executives, many of whom have been paid in stock for years and stood to lose millions of dollars if their holdings were wiped out. Airline chiefs collected tens of millions per year in compensation before the pandemic, in part by boosting their companies’ share prices by regularly buying back tens of billions in shares. That meant setting aside less money for a rainy day — or, in this case, a pandemic.</p><p> 事实是航空公司的股东一直是最大的受益者。其中包括航空公司高管，其中许多人已经股票支付了多年，如果他们的持有人被擦掉，那就才能减少数百万美元。航空公司酋长在大流行前每年收集数百万美元，部分通过定期购买股份中的数十亿美元来提高他们的公司股价。这意味着在下雨天撇开少钱 - 或者，在这种情况下，大流行。</p><p>  But here we are: Shares of United traded below $20 in May; today they are above $60. The patterns are similar for the other major carriers.</p><p>  但在这里，我们是：5月份股票交易股价低于20美元;今天他们超过60美元。这些模式类似于其他主要载体。 </p><p> Airline stocks — lifted by taxpayers — are up nearly 200 percent from their pandemic trough and have almost recovered their losses.</p><p>航空公司 - 由纳税人解除 - 占大流行槽的近200％，几乎恢复了他们的损失。</p><p>  It is fair to say that we socialized the airline industry’s losses and largely privatized the gains.</p><p>  它说，我们很公平地说，我们社会化航空业的损失，并在基本上私有化。</p><p> No other industry affected by the pandemic received more from the government. There was no special program for hotels or restaurants or travel agencies. Companies in those industries had to line up for the small business-focused Paycheck Protection Program and pray. The largest loan the program could make was $10 million.</p><p> 没有其他受到大流行影响的行业从政府获得更多。没有特殊的酒店或餐馆或旅行社。这些行业的公司不得不排队小型企业薪水保护计划并祈祷。该计划最大的贷款可以制定为1000万美元。</p><p> The question isn’t whether airline employees should have been helped, it’s whether airline shareholders should have been. The airline bailouts weren’t simply a job-protection program, as advertised. In case you’re not convinced, there’s this: United invested $20 million into an electric helicopter company last month that went public through a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. Does that sound like a company that is in such dire straits that it requires a taxpayer-funded bailout? It received a third rescue payment after it made the investment.</p><p> 问题不是航空公司员工是否应该得到帮助，这是航空公司股东是否应该是。公布的航空公司救助计划不仅仅是求职计划，如宣传。如果您不相信，这是：今年通过特殊用途收购公司或SPAC，美国上市将2000万美元投入了电动直升机公司。这听起来像是在这样的公司中，它需要纳税人资助的救助吗？它在投资后获得了第三次救援。</p><p> With the stock market now soaring, it is worth considering whether the airlines needed taxpayer money at all. Private investors seem to be willing to  throw money at everything these days, from celebrity-backed blank-check companies with no profits to troubled video game retailers, Bitcoin and digital art. Why not airlines?</p><p> 随着股市现在飙升，值得考虑航空公司是否需要纳税人金钱。私人投资者似乎愿意这些天的一切，来自名人支持的空白检查公司，没有利润陷入困境的视频游戏零售商，比特币和数字艺术。为什么不航空公司？</p><p> Even during the depths of the pandemic, in April last year, Carnival Cruise Line managed to raise $4 billion in debt from private investors, just as the airlines were still negotiating their first rescue deal with the government. That said, Carnival had to pay dearly for the money, with an interest rate of around 12 percent.</p><p> 即使在大流行深度的深处，去年4月，嘉年华巡航行管理到私人投资者筹集了40亿美元的债务，正如航空公司仍然谈判与政府的第一次救援协议谈判。也就是说，狂欢节不得不为这笔钱支付良好的费用，利率约为12％。</p><p> The   stimulus payments would be $1,400 for most recipients. Those who are eligible would also receive an identical payment for each of their children. To qualify for the full $1,400, a single person would need an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or below. For heads of household, adjusted gross income would need to be $112,500 or below, and for married couples filing jointly that number would need to be $150,000 or below. To be eligible for a payment, a person must have a Social Security number.

COBRA, for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, generally lets someone who loses a job buy coverage via the former employer. But it’s expensive: Under normal circumstances, a person may have to pay at least 102 percent of the cost of the premium. Under the relief bill, the government would pay the entire COBRA premium from April 1 through Sept. 30. A person who qualified for new, employer-based health insurance someplace else before Sept. 30 would lose eligibility for the no-cost coverage. And someone who left a job voluntarily would not be eligible, either.

More people would be eligible, and many recipients would get a bigger break. The bill would also make the credit fully refundable, which means you could collect the money as a refund even if your tax bill was zero. “That will be helpful to people at the lower end” of the income scale, said Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax &amp; Accounting.

You wouldn’t have to pay income taxes on forgiven debt if you qualify for loan forgiveness or cancellation — for example, if you’ve been in an income-driven repayment plan for the requisite number of years, if your school defrauded you or if Congress or the president wipes away $10,000 of debt for large numbers of people. This would be the case for debt forgiven between Jan. 1, 2021, and the end of 2025.

About $27 billion would go toward emergency rental assistance. The vast majority of it would replenish the so-called Coronavirus Relief Fund, created by the CARES Act and distributed through state, local and tribal governments,   according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. That’s on top of the $25 billion in assistance provided by the relief package passed in December. To receive financial assistance — which could be used for rent, utilities and other housing expenses — households would have to meet several   conditions. Household income could not exceed 80 percent of the area median income, at least one household member must be at risk of homelessness or housing instability, and individuals would have to qualify for unemployment benefits or have experienced financial hardship (directly or indirectly) because of the pandemic. Assistance could be provided for up to 18 months,   according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. Lower-income families that have been unemployed for three months or more would be given priority for assistance.

They made the case that if airlines were to fall into bankruptcy, there would be no planes ready to help revive the economy when the time came. They argued that pilots couldn’t be laid off and quickly rehired, since they need to be in flight regularly or training on simulators to be certified to fly.</p><p> 航空公司酋长和工会老板劝告大会，该行业是不同的 - 更不可或缺。他们致意了这种情况，如果航空公司陷入破产，那么就没有飞机准备好帮助恢复经济的时候。他们认为，飞行员无法休息并迅速地重新努力，因为他们需要定期飞行或培训模拟器被认证飞行。</p><p> Would airlines have stopped flying in bankruptcy? Nope. In previous airline bankruptcies — and there have been dozens — the companies kept operating. The government could have provided financing under that scenario, similar to the way it did when it rescued General Motors in 2009, taking a major equity stake in the company so that taxpayers could share in the upside when it recovered.</p><p> 航空公司会停止破产吗？没有。在以前的航空公司破产 - 并且已经有几十次 - 公司保持运营。政府可以在这种情况下提供融资，类似于它在2009年获救通用汽车的情况下，在公司筹集了一项重大股权，使纳税人在恢复时可以在上行中分享。</p><p> The airlines, in exchange for the taxpayer money, agreed to some conditions, including halting stock buybacks, reducing executive pay and agreeing to issue stock warrants to the government. But the warrants are tiny. In the case of American Airlines,  the company will issue warrants that are worth about $230 million today — a small fraction of the $4 billion that the taxpayers bequeathed the carrier’s shareholders in the first round of bailouts.</p><p> 航空公司以换取纳税人的资金，同意一些条件，包括停留股票回购，减少高管薪酬并同意向政府发行股票权证。但认股权证很小。就美国航空公司而言，本公司将发行价值约2.3亿美元的认股权证 - 纳税人在第一轮救助者留下了承运人股东的40亿美元的一小部分。 </p><p> Of course, we’ll never know what would have happened to the industry had it been forced to raise money on its own.</p><p>当然，我们永远不会知道该行业发生了什么，它被迫自己筹集资金。</p><p> “Congress has saved thousands of airline jobs, preserved the livelihoods of our hard-working team members and helped position the industry to play a central role in the nation’s recovery from Covid-19,” Mr. Parker and a top lieutenant at American Airlines said in a statement after the latest round of bailouts last week. “Lawmakers from both parties have backed legislation that recognizes the dedication of airline professionals and the importance of the essential work they do.”</p><p> “国会已经节省了数千家航空公司的工作，保留了我们勤劳的团队成员的生计，并帮助了该行业在国家从Covid-19复苏发挥着核心作用，”帕克先生和美国航空公司的顶级中尉说在上周最新一轮救助之后的声明中。 “双方的立法者已经支持立法，认识到航空公司专业人才的奉献，以及他们所做的基本工作的重要性。”</p><p> After the banking crisis of 2008 led to bailouts, the recriminations began when firms like Goldman Sachs had a banner year in the aftermath — and paid bankers record bonuses.</p><p> 2008年银行危机导致救助人员后，当戈尔曼萨赫斯这样的公司在后果举行横幅年度和支付的银行家纪录奖金时开始了。</p><p> Will the same thing happen to the airlines? Under the terms of their bailouts, the chief executives’ compensation this year and last was capped at about half what they received before the pandemic.</p><p> 航空公司会发生同样的事情吗？根据救助条款，今年的首席执行官赔偿并在大流行前覆盖了大约一半的内容。</p><p> Delta has already begun to issue special payments to some other managers. It says this is to compensate them in part for extra hours worked during the pandemic. “The payment of special bonuses to management while the airline is still burning cash is premature and inappropriate,” said Chris Riggins, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association, in a statement this month.</p><p> Delta已经开始向其他一些经理发出特殊付款。它说这是为了弥补它们在大流行期间工作的额外时间。 “在航空公司仍然燃烧现金的同时支付专门奖金，而空军飞行员协会发言人克里斯里格斯表示，在本月的一份声明中，克里斯里格斯表示。</p><p> The worst for the airline industry may be over, but the debate about the appropriateness of the pandemic bailouts is just getting started.</p><p> 最糟糕的航空行业可能结束，但关于大流行救助人员的适当性的辩论才刚刚开始。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/business/dealbook/airline-bailouts.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/business/dealbook/airline-bailouts.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/航空公司/">#航空公司</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/bailouts/">#bailouts</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
