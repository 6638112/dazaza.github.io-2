This is the edited script of a talk I gave for the Game Dev Days 2020.</p><p>终于，在它发布后将近3个月，我可以停止考虑古特瓦勒了。这是我在2020年游戏开发日的演讲的经过编辑的脚本。</p><p>     A few years ago I only did gamejams.  Gamejams are essentially deadlines, forcing you finish something.  I also did a lot of short jams alone, where i would sit down and give myself 30 minutes to make a prototype. Many of the gifs I post on twitter are the results of these solo jams.   This helped me to learn to code and to design and to schedule, but over time I found that simply making stuff was not enough anymore.  What I really love is doing something new.  Something that has not existed before. Finding a new angle on an old problem brings me an intense, deep joy that is really hard to describe.  There is a lot of unexplored space in games and what I am currently really interested in is  expression: How do I tell a story through a game?   How do I communicate how I feel through videogames?   Its really hard and kind of stupid, considering that videogames are all about endless repetition in closed systems, but its what i want to explore right now.   And I explored it at my own pace while working as a receptionist, making games like  Up in the sky and  Every Wall.</p><p>     几年前，我只玩游戏。 Gamejams本质上是最后期限，迫使您完成某些工作。我还独自做过很多简短的果酱，在那里我坐下来给自己30分钟时间来制作原型。我在推特上发布的许多gif都是这些单独果酱的结果。这帮助我学习了编码，设计和日程安排，但是随着时间的流逝，我发现仅仅制作东西已经不够了。我真正喜欢的是做新的事情。以前不存在的东西。在一个旧问题上找到新的角度给我带来了强烈而深刻的喜悦，这真的很难描述。游戏中有很多未开发的空间，而我目前真正感兴趣的是表情：如何通过游戏讲故事？如何通过电子游戏传达自己的感受？考虑到电子游戏都是在封闭系统中无休止的重复，这确实非常愚蠢，但是我现在想探索的是。当我担任接待员时，我按照自己的节奏进行了探索，制作了《天上掉下来》和《隔壁》等游戏。</p><p>  There is a game developer called  miziziziz, one of the few who makes watchable youtube videos, who made a commercial game called  Theyes Thou in one month.  When I lost my job as a receptionist because of the coronavirus, I decided to steal that idea. Since I am not overly interested in traditional FUN game design, I needed to make something that felt new to me.  I needed to make a game that actually said something about the world we move through everyday. Just making an entertainment box would have been too boring and unfocused.   But since I was unemployed I felt like I needed to make something that at least had a shot at commercial viability. One month is not a lot of time, but I needed to come up with something that people would also want to pay for. The roguelike we ended up making contains a short section at the end where I try to actually say something, where I try to express myself. This part of the game was important to me, the rest was just decorations.  I wanted people to buy the game because it looked like a nice little roguelike, and then, in the end, I wanted them to engage with this secret part of the game that was actually important to me.   And I had one month to make that real.</p><p>  有一个名为miziziziz的游戏开发者，是制作可观看的youtube视频的少数几个游戏开发者之一，他们在一个月内制作了一款名为“ thees Thou”的商业游戏。当我因为冠状病毒而失去了接待员的工作时，我决定偷这个想法。由于我对传统的FUN游戏设计并不太感兴趣，因此我需要做出一些对我来说新鲜的东西。我需要制作一款游戏，该游戏实际上讲述了我们每天穿越的世界。仅仅制作一个娱乐盒就太无聊和专心。但是由于我失业了，所以我觉得我需要做出至少对商业可行性有影响的事情。一个月不是很多时间，但是我需要想出一些人们也想付钱的东西。我们最终做出的流氓行为在结尾处包含一小段，我试图说些什么，并在其中表达自己。游戏的这一部分对我很重要，其余的只是装饰。我希望人们购买该游戏，因为它看起来像个不错的小流氓，然后最终，我希望他们参与游戏中对我来说很重要的秘密部分。我有一个月的时间来实现这一目标。</p><p>  Gutwhale is a product of its deadline.  All of it was made in the easiest way possible. The code is a mess of course, but I want to talk more about the decisions, forced upon us by the deadline, that permeate the whole project:</p><p>  Gutwhale是其最后期限的产物。所有这些都是以最简单的方式完成的。代码当然是一团糟，但是我想更多地讨论在整个截止日期之前强制我们执行的决策：</p><p> Gutwhale is only called Gutwhale because the project needed an artist. Franek is very good at making pixelart and he, for whatever reason, also loves to draw whales. So when he was on the fence about joining the project, I quickly changed the setting to take place inside of a whale. This does not make a lot of sense, but Franek got to draw a whale and the game had an artist.</p><p> Gutwhale之所以称为Gutwhale，是因为该项目需要一位艺术家。 Franek擅长制作Pixelart，无论出于何种原因，他也喜欢画鲸鱼。因此，当他对加入该项目感到不安时，我迅速将设置更改为在鲸鱼内部进行。这没有多大意义，但是Franek不得不画一条鲸鱼，并且游戏中有一位艺术家。</p><p>  Gutwhale used to take place on a single screen, because then I would not have to write a camera system. When it turned out that a single screen was pretty boring, we just glued multiple single screens together and make the floor break once all enemies were defeated. The core loop of Gutwhale was born out of not wanting to code a camera system.</p><p>  古特瓦勒曾经发生在单个屏幕上，因为这样我就不必编写摄像系统。事实证明，单个屏幕非常无聊，我们只是将多个单个屏幕粘合在一起，一旦所有敌人都被击败，就让地板破了。古特瓦勒（Gutwhale）的核心循环源于不想编写摄像系统的代码。</p><p>  The small size of the Levels themselves helped me in a lot of ways. The level generation code does not need to consider unreachable platforms and could be hacked together violently. Because there is so little space to move around in, enemies become more dangerous and I needed to code less of them to fill the game.</p><p>  小级别的水平本身在很多方面帮助了我。级别生成代码不需要考虑无法访问的平台，并且可以被暴力地合并在一起。由于移动空间太小，敌人变得更加危险，我需要编写更少的代码来填充游戏。 </p><p> The deadline forced me to think quickly and to design dirtily, accidentally disovering some pretty neat things. It certainly has also hurt the game in a lot of ways.</p><p>截止日期迫使我快速思考并进行肮脏的设计，无意间破坏了一些精美的东西。当然，它也从很多方面伤害了游戏。</p><p>   For people with little to no platformer roguelike experience, it is extremely hard.minutes and then give up, never to touch the game again.  For people who played downwell and gonner, it is a piece of cake and they can 100% the game in around 20 minutes. There is an endless nightmare mode, but it did not have an engaging highscore system, so the best players of Gutwhale quickly got bored.  The save system of Gutwhale had horrible bugs and there were technical problems all over the place, prohibitung us from implementing Achievements and updating the game easily. We used Construct 2, an engine that is no longer supported by its developers in favour of Construct 3. This made it impossible to add Steam Achievements and created some other technical problems. And these problems are just that:  Problems.   They exist because we rushed through development at an insane speed and I can forgive myself for making them, because I was actually focusing on this one secret thing at the end.   BUT  The part of the game that is most important to me, the ending, is also not working as intended. I was unable to clearly communicate what I wanted to communicate.  There was not enough time to conduct long term playtests and interview players about how they perceived the ending. There was not enough time for me to really reflect and ponder and tweak and adjust the ending of Gutwhale. I started the project as a compromise between compelling gameplay and a secret, expressive part, which enabled me to keep working on the game. And that part did not work. It did not resonate.  At least it feels like that to me now.</p><p>   对于几乎没有平台游戏的无赖体验的人来说，这是非常艰难的。几分钟之后，就放弃了，再也不想碰它了。对于玩井下和贡纳游戏的人来说，这只是小菜一碟，他们可以在20分钟内100％完成游戏。有一个无尽的噩梦模式，但是它没有引人入胜的高分系统，因此古特瓦尔的最佳球员很快就感到无聊。 Gutwhale的保存系统存在可怕的错误，并且到处都是技术问题，这使我们无法实施Achievements和轻松地更新游戏。我们使用了构造2，该引擎不再受其开发人员支持，而是转为构造3。这使得添加Steam Achievements成为不可能，并且造成了其他一些技术问题。这些问题就是：问题。它们之所以存在，是因为我们以疯狂的速度着手进行开发，而我可以原谅自己制造它们，因为最终我实际上只专注于这一秘密。但是游戏对我来说最重要的部分，即结局，也未达到预期的效果。我无法清楚地传达我想传达的内容。没有足够的时间进行长期游戏测试并就玩家对结局的看法采访玩家。我没有足够的时间去真正地思考，思考和调整，并调整古特瓦勒的结局。我开始这个项目时是在引人入胜的游戏玩法和秘密的表现力部分之间做出折衷，这使我得以继续从事游戏。那部分没有用。它没有引起共鸣。至少现在对我来说就是这样。</p><p>   It made me more money than I would have earned at my previous job, but not nearly enough to not have to go back to that job in 7 days.</p><p>   这使我赚到的钱比我上一份工作所赚的钱还多，但还不足以在7天之内不再需要这份工作。</p><p>      and last but defenitly not least, I got to work with Franek, Britt Brady and Clovelt who have thaught me a lot and are amazing people.</p><p>      最后但也是最重要的一点是，我与Franek，Britt Brady和Clovelt一起工作，这让我非常高兴，并且是很棒的人。</p><p>  Finishing games is hard.  Really hard.  As a way to deal with this, a series of game jams has been created, where speed is key and the end product is only as important as the fact that it got finished. We have seen amazing games made in insanely short times and countless people have been able to dabble in game dev because of the contained nature of game jams.    BUT  Applying this need for speed to bigger projects creates dynamics that should not be confused with efficiency and skill.  The core part of Gutwhale, the one thing I was truly interested in, withered and died because of the deadline, because we were so wrapped up in getting the game done.  There was simply not enough time to stop and smell the flowers. The deadline mercilessly and in cold blood, pulled us away from being able to express ourselves.  Gutwhale is nice and I am proud of it, but i think it is time for me to force myself to move on to a different way of development.  When i did not know what I wanted express through the games I make, when i just wanted to MAKE, I needed frameworks to support me, to force me to do the work and to put in the hours, but after years of doing that, those structures have started to feel inhibiting in the best way possible.  They are still able to teach me and to challenge me, but in the end, they are also keeping me from moving towards, to where I want to go, to do what I want to create. Deadlines keep me from really reflecting and looking at myself. They keep me from thinking about what i want to express through my work and they keep me from then actually saying that.</p><p>  完成游戏很难。真的很难。作为解决此问题的方法，已经创建了一系列游戏卡纸，其中速度是关键，而最终产品的重要性仅取决于它完成的事实。我们已经看到了惊人的短时间内制作出的出色游戏，并且由于游戏拥堵的固有性质，无数人能够涉足游戏开发。但是，将速度的这种需求应用到较大的项目中会产生动态，不应与效率和技能相混淆。 Gutwhale的核心部分是我真正感兴趣的一件事，由于截止日期而枯萎，死了，因为我们非常忙于完成游戏。根本没有足够的时间停下来闻花香。截止日期无情和冷血，使我们无法表达自己的意思。古特瓦勒很友善，我为此感到自豪，但是我认为现在是时候让我强迫自己迈向另一种发展方式了。当我不知道自己想通过自己制作的游戏表达什么时，当我只是想制作游戏时，我需要框架来支持我，迫使我去做工作并投入大量时间，但是经过多年的努力，这些结构已经开始以最好的方式受到抑制。他们仍然能够教我并向我挑战，但最终，他们也使我无法朝着自己想去的地方前进，去做自己想创造的事情。截止日期使我无法真正反思和看着自己。他们阻止我思考我想通过我的工作表达什么，并且阻止我从那时起就这样说。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="http://stuffedwomb.at/goodbye_gutwhale">http://stuffedwomb.at/goodbye_gutwhale</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/2020/">#2020</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/再见/">#再见</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/goodbye/">#goodbye</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
