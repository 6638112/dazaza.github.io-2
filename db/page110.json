The 2.03\u00a0m (6\u00a0foot\u00a07\u00a0inch) by 3.58\u00a0m (11\u00a0foot\u00a09\u00a0inch) canvas was started in 1880 and finished in 1891. Repin recorded the years of work along the lower edge of the canvas.  Alexander III bought the painting for 35,000  rubles, at the time the greatest sum ever paid for a Russian painting. Since then, the canvas has been exhibited in the  State Russian Museum in  Saint Petersburg.\n   Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks depicts a supposedly historical tableau, set in 1676, and based on the legend of  Cossacks sending an insulting reply to an ultimatum from the  Sultan of the  Ottoman Empire,  Mehmed IV.\n According to the (unsubstantiated) story, the  Zaporozhian Cossacks (from &#34;beyond the rapids&#34;, Ukrainian:  za porohamy), inhabiting the lands around the lower  Dnieper River in  Ukraine) had defeated  Ottoman Empire forces in battle. However, Mehmed demanded that the Cossacks submit to Ottoman rule. The Cossacks, led by  Ivan Sirko, replied in a characteristic manner: they wrote a letter, replete with insults and profanities. The painting exhibits the Cossacks&#39; pleasure at striving to come up with ever more base vulgarities.\n  Sultan Mehmed IV to the Zaporozhian Cossacks:As the Sultan; son of Muhammad; brother of the sun and moon; grandson and viceroy of God; ruler of the kingdoms of Macedonia, Babylon, Jerusalem, Upper and Lower Egypt; emperor of emperors; sovereign of sovereigns; extraordinary knight, never defeated; steadfast guardian of the tomb of Jesus Christ; trustee chosen by God Himself; the hope and comfort of Muslims; confounder and great defender of Christians \u2013 I command you, the Zaporogian Cossacks, to submit to me voluntarily and without any resistance, and to desist from troubling me with your attacks.\n   O sultan, Turkish devil and damned devil&#39;s kith and kin, secretary to Lucifer himself. What the devil kind of knight are thou, that canst not slay a hedgehog with your naked arse? The devil shits, and your army eats. Thou shalt not, thou son of a whore, make subjects of Christian sons. We have no fear of your army; by land and by sea we will battle with thee. Fuck thy mother.\n Thou Babylonian scullion, Macedonian wheelwright, brewer of Jerusalem, goat-fucker of Alexandria, swineherd of Greater and Lesser Egypt, pig of Armenia,  Podolian thief,  catamite of Tartary, hangman of  Kamyanets, and fool of all the world and underworld, an idiot before God, grandson of the Serpent, and the crick in our dick. Pig&#39;s snout, mare&#39;s arse, slaughterhouse cur, unchristened brow. Screw thine own mother!\n So the Zaporozhians declare, you lowlife. You won&#39;t even be herding pigs for the Christians. Now we&#39;ll conclude, for we don&#39;t know the date and don&#39;t own a calendar; the moon&#39;s in the sky, the year with the Lord. The day&#39;s the same over here as it is over there; for this kiss our arse!\n  In the 19th century, the historical Zaporozhian Cossacks were sometimes the subject of picturesque tales demonstrating admiration of their primitive vitality and contemptuous disregard for authority (in marked contrast to the more civilized subjects of the authoritarian Russian state).  [2] Whether the incident portrayed actually happened or is a just another of these tales is not known, but no concrete or reliable evidence exists that it did happen,  [2] although the question remains disputed.\n Nikolai Gogol&#39;s 1842  romantic- historical novella   Taras Bulba describes the incident in passing. Repin associated with  Savva Mamontov and his artistic circle and probably heard the story there; at any rate, Repin made his first sketches for the painting in Mamontov&#39;s home.  [2]\n While working on the original version,  Repin in 1889 began work on a second version. This work remained unfinished. The artist tried to make the second version of  The Cossacks more &#34;historically authentic&#34;. In 1932 it was transferred by the  Tretyakov Gallery to the  M. F. Sumtsov Kharkiv Historical Museum. In 1935, it was moved to the  Kharkiv Art Museum \u00a0[ ru;  fr;  de], where it is now stored. This canvas is slightly smaller than the original version.\n The historian  Dmytro Yavornytsky assisted Repin in portraying the scene authentically.   Vladimir Gilyarovsky, a popular journalist of partial Cossack descent, was said to be one of the models who posed for Repin. This, however, turned out to be a falsehood.  [4]\n   The French poet  Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a versified version of the letter (&#34;R\u00e9ponse des Cosaques Zaporogues au Sultan de Constantinople&#34;) as part of his poem &#34;La Chanson du mal-aim\u00e9&#34; in his collection of poems   Alcools (1913).\n This versified version of the letter has been set to music by the French singer-songwriter  L\u00e9o Ferr\u00e9, who composed a whole  oratorio on   La Chanson du mal-aim\u00e9 for soloists, choir and orchestra (1953). Verses were also set to music by  Dmitri Shostakovich in his  Symphony No. 14, amongst other poets (Lorca, Rilke) writing about death.\n   Art critic  Clement Greenberg selected Repin&#39;s painting as a bad example of &#34; kitsch&#34; in his influential essay   Avant-Garde and Kitsch (1939).  [5]\n   A trailer for the &#34;Cossacks&#34; expansion to the video game   Europa Universalis IV includes an altered version of the reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks (2015).  [6]\n The game   Cossacks: European Wars has the central detail of the picture in its logo.\n A parody of the painting was created in 2017 titled &#39;Letter to the Enemies of Russia&#39; by Vasily Nesterenko which depicts Russian soldiers in Syria writing a letter to President Erdogan of Turkey.\n  Several full-size copies of the Repin painting exist, including a famous reproduction by  Pavel Porfirov (Repin&#39;s student), currently held by the  Cincinnati Art Museum.\n  ^     a     b     c    Walther K.

Perhaps, she speculated, these journalists were jealous of her, \u201ca woman who wears size four\u201d and who has \u201cno trouble staying slim.\u201d Her theory was put to the test when  The Saturday Evening Post sent Joan Didion to profile her in 1968, the year that Ronald Reagan, then the governor of California, would lose the Republican presidential primary to Richard Nixon. If not a competition of looks or a comparison of waistbands, then what could have accounted for the resulting article? \u201cPretty Nancy\u201d followed the style that was then becoming distinctive of Didion\u2019s journalistic prose: a blunt, self-assured series of descriptions and observations that lead the reader to believe she was just writing down what she saw. Here is Nancy pretending to pluck a rhododendron blossom. Here is Nancy finding her light. Here is Nancy wearing \u201cthe smile of a woman who seems to be playing out some middle-class American woman\u2019s daydream, circa 1948.\u201d 1     Nancy, of course, did not like Didion\u2019s profile. She found it sardonic and judgmental and accused Didion of having written the piece before they even met. She couldn\u2019t understand it, she said later. She thought they were having a nice time. 2 What is it about Joan Didion that seduces and then betrays? In her writing she promises little, and in her public life she offers even less. The title of Didion\u2019s new essay collection,  Let Me Tell You What I Mean, almost seems like the kind of cruel joke one might find in one of her pieces. Has a writer ever been less likely to say just what she means? Across the 12 works included\u2014which span Didion\u2019s entire career from her column in  The Saturday Evening Post in the late 1960s and \u201970s to one-off essays and reports for  The New Yorker to speeches given at her alma mater, as well as introductions to other people\u2019s books\u2014the impression one gets is that of reading a magazine made up of all ledes and kickers. This is the case with \u201cPretty Nancy,\u201d too. It contains many of Didion\u2019s trademarks. Her sentences often exist as aphorisms, all the more brutal for being brief; her choice of weapon tends to be the direct quote. These tendencies capture something true about her writing in general: Her essays show a writer who attempts a close reading of the powerful people and strange circumstances she encounters but then, when understanding proves difficult, draws back to look at them from a great, flat distance. 3  In  Blue Nights, her 2011 memoir about grief, family, and work, Didion said that when she and her husband, John Gregory Dunne, worked on dialogue for their screenplays, they would mark the time a character spent speaking before coming up with the words themselves: What was said was not as important as the rhythm and length of the speech. Her essays also have this novelistic approach. As Hilton Als notes in his foreword to  Let  Me Tell You What I Mean, \u201ca peculiar aspect of Joan Didion\u2019s nonfiction is that a significant portion of it reads like fiction.\u201d This appears to be the case, however, not because Didion is too imaginative in her journalistic renderings but rather because of her sense of control over the material and her certainty of its meaning, as though nothing happens without her permission. 4  One finds echoes of this approach in the way Didion circles around the California governor\u2019s wife, the tension hovering in the sharp point she holds back from making. There are inferences into what kind of person Nancy is, what kind of mother her teenage son might see her as, what kind of sycophantic circle a political family might live within. In many ways, Didion casts Nancy in a film of her own making. The writing could serve as cues for a character in a screenplay rather than as descriptions of a real-life woman in a magazine profile. 5 Let Me Tell You What I Mean includes a kind of corollary to \u201cPretty Nancy,\u201d Didion\u2019s 2000 profile of Martha Stewart (or, more to the point, of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia LLC), another story of a woman in the business of promising domestic harmony. \u201cThis is getting out of the house with a vengeance, and on your own terms,\u201d Didion writes, \u201cthe secret dream of any woman who has ever made a success of a PTA cake sale.\u201d Didion\u2019s sentences have a way of taking a person at face value and seeing the way subtle truths lie under glossy surfaces. 6  Other profiles are of groups, like her essay on a meeting of Gamblers Anonymous, in which she writes that she had to leave as soon as she heard the people there speak of \u201cserenity,\u201d because it is a word she associates with death. There is a profile of a building, too\u2014San Simeon, the castle William Randolph Hearst built with his newspaper fortune. Here, Didion\u2019s classic cruelties are put to good use, showing her disdain for the wealthy who never had to learn how to use their money wisely: \u201cSan Simeon was\u2026exactly the castle a child would build, if a child had $220 million and could spend $40 million of it on a castle.\u201d 7 When writing about what she likes, Didion finds herself drawn to her subjects with an intimate approach; she writes about them as if she is sharing their secret. In \u201cAlicia and the Underground Press,\u201d the subject is alternative newspapers, but the essay is really about the purportedly objective mainstream press and Didion\u2019s fatigue in the face of it\u2014she much prefers a journalistic tone that mimics a conversation between friends. \u201cThese papers ignore the conventional newspaper code,\u201d she explains in what, for her, can be read as praise, and instead \u201csay what they mean.\u201d When a writer at an underground newspaper has a thought, Didion adds, they say so, and best of all \u201cquite often in lieu of who, what, where, when, how.\u201d 8 But as the reader continues through the essays in this collection, her writing can also take on the feeling of being alone in someone else\u2019s living room: She is going through their homes in search of a secret. In her article about the Hearst castle, she critiques the childishness of grown men, and in \u201cOn Being Unchosen by the College of One\u2019s Choice,\u201d she critiques the overgrown precociousness in children. As with a face in profile, the angles are everything. 9 Didion loves other people\u2019s words, to turn them over and examine them from all sides. This does not necessarily mean that she is faithful to what they said: \u201cWhy I Write,\u201d a speech she gave at UC Berkeley and included here, is now frequently quoted in essays about Didion for its unrelenting admission that she considers writing a hostile act. She also returns in the speech to the cinematographer\u2019s lens: 10 Many people know about camera angles now, but not so many know about sentences. The arrangement of the words matters, and the arrangement you want can be found in the picture in your mind\u2026. The picture tells you how to arrange the words and the arrangement of the words tells you, or tells me, what\u2019s going on in the picture. 11\n The questions such a collection of essays demands\u2014for example, why these pieces, and why now?\u2014invite a cynical answer that is then attached, inextricably so, to the thought itself: Because these are the pieces that haven\u2019t been recently collected; because these are the pieces that can be sold either to the completist or to the casual reader. If this book does have a theme, it is one indistinguishable from what many readers already know about Didion: that all of this writing is less about the topic than about how Didion feels about it. This unanswerable approach can almost lead the reader to the point of hypnosis\u2014no matter the subject, her preferred subtext is what she won\u2019t tell and we can\u2019t know. Nancy Reagan probably had many reasons to feel betrayed by Didion\u2019s article, but the reason she was insulted had nothing to do with Didion\u2019s insincerity: She evades, but she does not lie. In her writing, she may not tell us what she means, but we can certainly sense how she feels. 12 Betrayal, of course, is possible only when a loyalty has been broken. Who, readers might ask, does Didion stand with? What is she for or against? In a 1972 essay, \u201cSeduction and Betrayal,\u201d Elizabeth Hardwick said that these two illicit actions have become a question more of psychology than of ethics. \u201cWe ask ourselves how the delinquent ones feel about their seductions, adulteries, betrayals, and it is by the quality of their feelings that our moral judgments are formed\u2026. In novelistic relations, where the pain inflicted is only upon the feelings of another person, everything is blurred.\u201d 13    When New York Review Books reissued this essay along with some of Hardwick\u2019s other essays in 2001, Didion made the following observation in her introduction: 14 At the time  Seduction and Betrayal was first published, a reviewer in  The New  York  Times complained that if the book had a fault, it was that its author failed to \u201cmake sufficient distinctions between the real and the literary.\u201d That there are no such distinctions to be made, that the women we invent have changed the course of our lives as surely as the women we are, is in many ways the point of this passionate book. 15\n This fuzziness that both Hardwick and Didion describe\u2014of novels that seem like biographies, of news reports that read like fiction\u2014is perhaps the only way to read Didion\u2019s work. Every profile is of a character; every article invents a story. As she told a student reporter for Berkeley\u2019s  Daily Californian in 2001: 16 The whole way I think about politics came out of the English Department. They taught a form of literary criticism which was based on analyzing texts in a very close way. If you start analyzing the text of a newspaper or a political commentator on CNN using the same approach of close textual analysis, you come to understand it in a different way. It\u2019s not any different from reading Henry James. 17\n For Didion, politics, like a novel, pulls from life but also can exists as fantasy, and can therefore be read like literature. 18 With this, a key is handed to those inclined to read Didion like code. A woman can accept her fate or she cannot, Didion seems to say again and again; she can play heroine, or she can escape the narrative altogether. The future awaits us either way. A woman with no loyalties is a Madame Bovary. A woman who cannot help her loyalties is an Anna Karenina. A woman who is the last to discover her own loyalties is an Isabel Archer. And a woman who will write book after book and essay upon essay without ever claiming her own loyalties is a Joan Didion. 19 In novels by Henry James and his contemporaries, being a journalist is something of a punishment to the journalist and to those around the journalist: Reporters, editors, and critics are a necessary burden on the social circles of much more interesting characters and a quiet threat to good manners. Like Henrietta Stackpole, the feminist journalist who acts as a comic foil for Isabel Archer in  The Portrait of a Lady, their presence signals someone who knows a secret is currency. We wait in suspense to see if they try to cash it in. 20    The curious thing about reading Didion is finding her agree with this literary assessment. In \u201cAlicia and the Underground Press,\u201d and in other essay collections like  Political Fictions and nonfiction books like  Miami, we often find Didion describing a certain kind of journalist as a marginal figure, at the boundaries of an event. Their access\u2014and their determination to keep it\u2014often is a central theme in her descriptions of her peers. 21 Perhaps that\u2019s why Didion has also so frequently become a subject for other writers, and a subject of such strong critiques. The many roles she occupies\u2014journalist, novelist, and screenwriter\u2014has made her an idol of publishing, and with that vaunted status comes an ever-rotating inquiry into who she is and what she believes. I\u2019m sure some people read Didion and think she\u2019s just fine, but given her style, fame, and other forms of capital and cachet, it is also hard not to notice the extremes of love and hate. Readers and subjects alike often report the same mistaken expectations, the same hurt feelings, as they periodically look to excavate some meaning or matter from the extensive collection of writing that exists by or about Didion. 22 When critics go looking for signs or theories about Didion, they often turn to her politics. Writing for  Popula, Maria Bustillos argued that she was \u201cthe First Lady of Neoliberalism\u201d and that the fandom around Didion misses the politics at the center of so much of her writing. \u201cThe weirdest thing about it,\u201d Bustillos writes, \u201cis this dyed-in-the-wool conservative woman\u2026somehow became the irreproachable darling of New York media and stayed that way for decades, all on the strength of a dry, self-regarding prose style and a \u2018glamor shot\u2019 with a Corvette.\u201d 23 Reading Didion\u2019s latest collection is enough to convince anyone that her writing is often more evocative than empathetic, more interested in style than in meaning. For some this might be primarily a literary feature of her writing, but for Bustillos this has made her journalism often read like \u201can unrelenting exercise in class superiority.\u201d And it is true that Didion\u2019s politics, while often contradictory and strange, were not all that inscrutable or indiscernible. She was a woman who loved Barry Goldwater, who told her friends that Nixon was too liberal, who unironically embraced a gently nostalgic interpretation of Americana and never missed an opportunity to cite a Hemingway sentence or a John Wayne scene. Her ideology is right there for the reader\u2014laid out on the page, waiting for your interpretation. 24 But a reader is not a voyeur, and an audience has its own autonomy. Didion\u2019s calculated vanity turns other people into a reflection that somehow manages to show nothing; this does indeed look, to a certain type of romantic, like seduction. She puts herself in view and then shuts the blinds. This may frustrate some readers, but it is hardly an act of \u201cbetrayal.\u201d I often think about a line in Robert McKee\u2019s popular and frequently skewered screenwriting manual,  Story, in which he says that he is always surprised to see audiences who want to know everything possible about a character over the span of one film. You couldn\u2019t know everything about a person in an entire lifetime, he reminds us. What makes you think you can get it all in a 90-minute movie? 25 There was a time when reading Didion made me feel like I had swallowed something that burned\u2014that I could taste what it might be like to make someone sick with desire\u2014and she retains that sense of being both divisive and adored; she will remain a powerful observer of our times and someone whose style people are quick to turn into metaphor. You could read every Joan Didion book ever released, study every sentence, look for her name in the margins of other biographies and in the bylines of archived clippings, in the credits rolling past on the screen, and still, you might know nothing. 26\n    In order to comment, you must be logged in as a paid subscriber.\u00a0 Click here to log in\u00a0or subscribe.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 03:35:49", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u592a\u6781,didion,warning", "title": "\u743c\u8fea\u592a\u6781\u7684\u6f2b\u957f\u89c2\u70b9 ", "title_en": "Joan Didion\u2019s Long View", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/joan-didion-tell-you-what-mean-review/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u592a\u6781", "didion", "warning"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c28e87ba9b1fb310a21aab809066587f.png", "infoid": 1067534, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4e0d\u77e5\u4f55\u6545\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u534a\u5f26\u534a\u51fd\u6570\u8bed\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u80fd\u591f\u91c7\u53d6\u4e00\u4e9b\u4efb\u610fCSS\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u914d\u7ed9React\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed5\u8fc7CSS\u9009\u62e9\u5668We\uff06\uff0339;

You don&#39;t need to understand how cars work in order to drive, but it sure as heck helps when your car breaks down on the side of the road.\n Debugging CSS is hard enough on its own without adding in a layer of tooling magic! By demystifying styled-components, we&#39;ll be able to diagnose and fix weird CSS issues with way less frustration.\n In this blog post, we&#39;ll pop the hood and learn how it works by building our own mini-clone of \ud83d\udc85 styled-components.\n     styled-components comes with a collection of helper methods, each corresponding to a DOM node. There&#39;s  h1,  header,  button, and dozens more (they even support SVG elements like  line and  path!).\n The helper methods are called with a chunk of CSS, using an obscure JavaScript feature known as \u201ctagged template literals\u201d. For now, you can pretend that it&#39;s written like this:\n  h1 is a helper method on the  styled object, and we call it with a single argument, a string.\n These helper methods are little component factories. Every time we call them, we get a brand-new React component.\n   When we run  const Title = styled.h1(...), the  Title constant will be assigned to our  NewComponent component. And when we render the  Title component in our app, it&#39;ll produce an  &lt;h1&gt; DOM node.\n What about the  styles parameter that we passed to the  h1 function? How does it get used?\n  We come up with a unique class name by hashing  styles into a seemingly-random string, like  dKamQW or  iOacVe.\n  We inject a new CSS class into the page, using that hashed string as its name, and containing all of the CSS declarations from the  styles string.\n       In React, it&#39;s common to render some JSX conditionally. In this example, we only render our  &lt;Wrapper&gt; element if our  ItemList component is given some items:\n function ItemList({ items }) { if (items.length === 0) { return &#34;No items&#34;; } return ( &lt;Wrapper&gt; {/* Stuff omitted */} &lt;/Wrapper&gt; )}const Wrapper = styled.ul` background: goldenrod;`;// Rendering with an empty array:render(&lt;ItemList items={[]} /&gt;);\n It may surprise you to learn that styled-components doesn&#39;t do anything with the CSS we provided in this case. That  background declaration is never added to the DOM.\n Instead of eagerly generating CSS classes whenever a styled component is  defined, we wait until the component is  rendered before injecting those styles into the page.\n This is a good thing! On larger websites, it&#39;s not uncommon for  hundreds of kilobytes of unused CSS to be sent to the browser. With styled-components, you only pay for the CSS you render, not the CSS you write  .\n The only reason this works is because JavaScript has closures. Every component generated from  styled.h1 has its own little scope that holds the CSS string. When we render our  Wrapper component, even if it&#39;s seconds/minutes/hours later, it has exclusive access to the styles we&#39;ve written for it.\n There&#39;s one more reason that we defer CSS injection: because of interpolated styles. We&#39;ll cover those near the end of this article.\n  You might be wondering: how does that  createAndInjectCSSClass function work? Can we really generate new CSS classes from within JS?\n We can! One straightforward way is to create a  &lt;style&gt; tag, and then fill it with raw CSS text:\n  This method works, but it&#39;s cumbersome and slow. A more modern way to do this is with the CSSOM, the CSS version of the DOM. The CSSOM provides a friendlier way to add or remove CSS rules using JavaScript:\n  For a long time, styles generated through the CSSOM couldn&#39;t be edited in the Chrome developer tools. If you&#39;ve ever seen &#34;greyed out&#34; styles in the devtools, it&#39;s because of this limitation:\n   Thankfully, however, this changed in Chrome 85. If you&#39;re interested, the Chrome team  wrote a blog post about how they added support for CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components to the devtools.\n    This works, but we need many many more helpers! We need buttons and links and footers and asides and marquees  .\n There&#39;s another problem, too. As we&#39;ll see,  styled can be called as a function directly:\n  The  styled object is both a function and an object. Bewilderingly, this is a totally valid thing in JavaScript. We can do stuff like this:\n  Let&#39;s update our styled-components clone to support these new requirements. We can borrow some ideas from functional programming to make it possible.\n  This code uses a technique known as  currying. It allows us to &#34;preload&#34; the  Tag argument.\n If you haven&#39;t seen it before, currying can be a bit mindbending. But it&#39;s helpful in this case, as it allows us to easily create many shorthand helper methods:\n     One of the coolest things about styled-components is that we can mix them with our own custom components!\n  function Message({ children, ...delegated }) { return ( &lt;p {...delegated}&gt; You&#39;ve received a message: {children} &lt;/p&gt; );}const UrgentMessage = styled(Message)` background-color: pink;`;render( &lt;UrgentMessage&gt; We&#39;re having a fire sale! &lt;/UrgentMessage&gt;);\n At first glance, this seems absolutely magical. How are we applying those styles to our custom component?\n The key is in the prop delegation. Here&#39;s what we&#39;d see if we logged out that  delegated object:\n     We come up with a unique class name ( OkjqvF), and render the  Tag variable (our  Message component) with a  className prop.\n This only works if we apply the  className prop to an HTML node inside our component though.  The following won&#39;t work:\n  By delegating all of the props that  Message receives to the  &lt;p&gt; element it renders, we unlock this pattern. Thankfully, many third-party components (eg. the  Link component in react-router) follow this convention.\n    const Button = styled.button` background-color: transparent; font-size: 2rem;`const PinkButton = styled(Button)` background-color: pink;`;render( &lt;PinkButton&gt;Hello World&lt;/PinkButton&gt;);\n I used to think that the library &#34;merged&#34; these styles somehow, creating a new &#34;mega class&#34; that contained all the declarations. But it actually creates two distinct classes.\n   Our goal in this process is to make sure that the  PinkButton styles &#34;extend&#34;  Button styles. In the event of a conflict,  PinkButton should win.\n Rather than overcomplicating things in JavaScript, we can rely on CSS to do the hard work for us!\n In CSS, there is a complex hierarchy of rules that governs how to resolve conflicts. An ID selector,  #btn, will win out against a class selector,  .btn. Which in turn beats a tag selector,  button.\n But in this case, we have two classes! The two selectors,  .abc123 and  .def456, are equally matched. So the algorithm falls back to a secondary rule. It looks at the order of rules defined in the stylesheet.\n  An important clarification: The order that we  apply the classes doesn&#39;t matter. Consider this case:\n  You might  expect that the first paragraph would be red, and the second paragraph would be blue. But that would be incorrect: both paragraphs will be blue. The order of the classes in the  class attribute doesn&#39;t matter:\n  The styled-components library takes great care to ensure that CSS rules are inserted in the correct order, to make sure that the styles are applied correctly. This is a non-trivial problem: we do all kinds of dynamic things in React, and the library is constantly adding/removing classes, while ensuring that a sensible order is preserved.\n  We need to update our code so that it applies both of the classes. We can combine them like so:\n  When we render  PinkButton, the  Tag variable is equal to our  Button component.  PinkButton will generate a unique class name ( def456), and pass that as the  className prop to  Button.\n If you&#39;re confused by this process, you&#39;re not alone; we&#39;ve entered the mindbending realm of recursion, where styled-components are rendering styled-components. As I wrote this article, I tripped over this bit, and had to spend a minute reconfiguring my own understanding.\n But here&#39;s the thing: the exact JS mechanics that accomplish this aren&#39;t important. That&#39;s an implementation detail. The important thing is that you understand these takeaways:\n styled-components makes sure to insert these rules in the correct order, so that  PinkButton&#39;s styles will overwrite any conflicts in  Button.\n  We&#39;ve almost finished creating our minimum-viable styled-components clone, but there&#39;s one more task in our list:  .\n Sometimes, our CSS will depend on React props. For example, an image might take a  maxWidth prop:\n const ContentImage = styled.img` display: block; margin-bottom: 8px; width: 100%; max-width: ${p =&gt; p.maxWidth};`;render( &lt;&gt; &lt;ContentImage alt=&#34;A running shoe with pink laces and a rainbow decal&#34; src=&#34;/images/shoe.png&#34; maxWidth=&#34;200px&#34; /&gt; &lt;ContentImage alt=&#34;A close-up shot of the same running shoe&#34; src=&#34;/images/shoe-closeup.png&#34; /&gt; &lt;/&gt;)\n   The first class,  sc-bdnxRM, is used to uniquely identify the React component that was rendered ( ContentImage). It doesn&#39;t provide any styles, and we can ignore it for our purposes.\n  The seemingly-random class names,  JDSLg and  eXyedY, are actually hashes of the styles that will be applied. When we interpolate in a different  maxWidth prop, we get a different set of styles, and so a unique class is generated.\n This explains why we can&#39;t &#34;pre-generate&#34; the classes! We  have to wait until the component is rendered before we know what CSS will be applied, because the same  styled.button instance won&#39;t always produce the same styles.\n Interpolation isn&#39;t the only way we can customize the styles of one particular component instance. My personal favourite way is to use CSS variables. It looks like this:\n const ContentImage = styled.img` display: block; margin-bottom: 8px; width: 100%; max-width: var(--max-width);`;render( &lt;&gt; &lt;ContentImage alt=&#34;A running shoe with pink laces and a rainbow decal&#34; src=&#34;/images/shoe.png&#34; style={{ &#39;--max-width&#39;: &#39;200px&#39;, }} /&gt; &lt;ContentImage alt=&#34;A close-up shot of the same running shoe&#34; src=&#34;/images/shoe-closeup.png&#34; /&gt; &lt;/&gt;)\n If we inspect the HTML, we&#39;ll notice that both elements share the same CSS class:\n  By letting modern CSS do the dynamic stuff for us, we produce less CSS. This is also a potential performance win: when the dynamic data changes, we don&#39;t need to generate a whole new CSS class and append it to the page!\n I wrote about this pattern (and many others!) in my blog post,  \u201cThe styled-components Happy Path\u201d.\n     Tagged template literals are wild, and it would take an entirely separate blog post to explain how they work and what they&#39;re doing here.\n The important thing to know is that all of those little interpolation functions are called when the component is rendered, and used to &#34;fill in the gaps&#34; in our style string.\n   When we render our component,  reconcileStyles is able to invoke each of those interpolated functions with the data passed through props. In the end, we&#39;re left with a plain ol&#39; string with populated values.\n When the props change, the process is repeated, and a new CSS class is generated.\n  This blog post has been  a journey. Perhaps more than any other post I&#39;ve written, this one covers some pretty treacherous terrain. This stuff is not easy to wrap our mind around.\n If parts of this post didn&#39;t make much sense to you, that&#39;s alright! It might require a bit of percolation. As you continue to use styled-components, hopefully the ideas in this post will become clear.\n In addition to the practical benefits of understanding your tools, I hope that this post also helps you appreciate what the styled-components team has accomplished. Building and maintaining open-source software is never easy, and it&#39;s  especially fraught when working on a CSS-in-JS tool, in a community where the entire category is contentious.\n If you found this post helpful, you might be interested in something else I&#39;m working on. It&#39;s called  CSS for JavaScript Developers. It&#39;s a comprehensive online course specifically created for JS framework devs who find CSS confusing or frustrating. We learn exactly how CSS works as a language, from first principles, building a robust mental model that can be used to solve just about every layout challenge you encounter.\n I&#39;m planning to launch the course in September of this year.

The OnePlus 8 was part of the phone-maker&#39;s 2020 lineup. Though the OnePlus 8 Pro was bigger in size and spec, the high-level specs on this standard model still make it a decent flagship phone in 2021. OnePlus phones have generally appealed to us by offering flagship-level specs and performance for less than the ever-ballooning price of most high-end smartphones. This year\u2019s Prime Day sale takes the $500-600\u00a0 OnePlus 8 down to $349, a much more competitive price that again gives more expensive (and less expensive) phones a run for their money.\n Just looking at the spec sheet, you can see that\u2014with 5G support (on GSM networks like AT&amp;T and T-Mobile), a 6.55-inch 402 pixels-per-inch OLED display with a 90 Hz refresh rate, 8GB RAM (albeit of the slower LPDDR4X variety), 128GB of UFS 3.0 storage, and Qualcomm\u2019s 2020 flagship Snapdragon 865 processor\u2014the OnePlus 8 is a phone that remains competitive. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no removable storage, though that&#39;s not out of the ordinary in 2021.\n     There are big specs in the battery and camera department, as well. The 4,300 mAh battery uses OnePlus\u2019 Warp Charge technology to juice the phone from 1 percent to half-full in 22 minutes, according to the company, and it tends to last about a day under normal usage. Wireless charging is not available, though. To allow for varying shots and artistic expression, the camera array includes three different cameras: one with a standard lens, one with a macro lens, and one with an ultrawide-angle lens. The cameras range from decent to not so great, though we had a few surprisingly good moments in\u00a0 our experience with the phone.\n  Thankfully, OnePlus is  one of the better phone OEMs with regard to Android updates: the updates usually land within a few weeks of each release, though the company often lags 1 to 3 months behind on security updates. The company&#39;s Oxygen OS still looks good and makes useful customizations to the Android operating system, but because the OnePlus 8 is already a year old, you should only expect one more major software update  for Android 12 and a little less than two years of security updates. The OnePlus 8&#39;s update prowess, good looks, low cost, and not-cheap-feeling hardware are a lot more than we can say for many Android phones in 2021, particularly at this price point.\n Note: Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through\u00a0  affiliate programs .", "posttime": "2021-06-23 02:57:56", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u624b\u673a,\u4ea4\u6613,\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a,day,oneplus", "title": "149\u7f8e\u5143\u7684oneplus 8\u662f\u6700\u597d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u65e5\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u4ea4\u6613 ", "title_en": "The OnePlus 8 for $349 is the best Prime Day smartphone deal", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/amazon-prime-day-2021-best-smartphone-deals-oneplus-8/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u624b\u673a", "\u4ea4\u6613", "\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a", "day", "oneplus"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "dd8894544d6c1664f7da11526a549ad3.jpg", "infoid": 1067530, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8be5\u62df\u8bae\u7684\u6536\u8d2d\u662f\u4e0a\u4e2a\u6708\u5ba3\u5e03\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u5411\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86MGM\u76844,000\u90e8\u7535\u5f71\u548c17,000\u6b21\u5c55\u793a\u5c06\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5c04\u51fb\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76db\u4f1a\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u5e97\u9762\u672c\u8eab\u5c31\u662f\u5176\u5ba2\u6237\u7684\u8fdd\u7ea6\uff01\u7528\u4e8e\u6309\u9700\u5a92\u4f53\u3002\n  \u4f5c\u4e3a\u6743\u5229\u53d8\u5316\u624b\u548c\u516c\u53f8\u8f6c\u79fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6d41\u666f\u89c2\u662f\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684;\u867d\u7136Netflix\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u5185\u5bb9\uff08\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u4e0d\u8fdc\u5904\uff09\u548c\u8fea\u65af\u5c3c\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5907\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f00\u59cb\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8282\u76ee\u548c\u7535\u5f71\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8282\u76ee\u548c\u7535\u5f71\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u5a92\u4f53\u884c\u4e1a\u5229\u6da6\u4e30\u539a\u7684\u5c3e\u5df4\u3002\n \u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u662f\u5426\u5e94\u8be5\u62e5\u6709\u5185\u5bb9\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6709\u6548\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7535\u5f71\u548c\u7535\u89c6\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u751f\u4ea7\u5546\uff0c\u516c\u53f8\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u76f4\u63a5\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8bb8\u53ef\u4ea4\u6613\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u7684\u5b50\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u51cf\u5c11\u5230\u5185\u90e8\u751f\u4ea7\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u96f6\u552e\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5de8\u5934\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7ade\u4e89\u5176\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u884c\u4e1a\u5e1d\u56fd\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002\n FTC\u4e3b\u5e2dLina Khan  -

As an independent producer of films and TV a company can secure its own licensing deals and operate in direct competition with similar businesses. As a subsidiary of Amazon, it would likely be in large part reduced to an in-house production company for the retail and web giant, not competing on the merits of its products but as part of a multi-industry empire.\n FTC Chair Lina Khan \u2014  appointed just last week \u2014 has been among the foremost critics of the latter business model. Her now famous \u201cAmazon\u2019s Antitrust Paradox\u201d paper asserted that Amazon uses dominance in one industry, like AWS in web hosting, to shore up other less successful arms, like its nascent delivery service. If the latter would fail without the support of the former, the argument (roughly) goes, the company is potentially engaging in anti-competitive behavior enabled by market power.\n That the market power and the behavior are in different verticals excused it under the antitrust doctrine of the recent era (so long as consumers didn\u2019t see price increases), but Khan aimed to challenge that doctrine with her paper \u2014 and now, as one of the most powerful regulators in the country, she has been given the chance to shape it firsthand.\n  Such large deals are always reviewed by federal authorities, and in this case the FTC is reportedly in charge, probably because it has already taken on the role of antitrust investigation into Amazon in other circumstances. It\u2019s also handling Facebook (which it has tangled with repeatedly over the years), while the agency\u2019s enforcement partners at the Justice Department took charge of looking into Google and Apple. (The FTC declined to comment, saying it does not confirm the existence of investigations.)\n In this case it seems unlikely that the Amazon purchase of MGM will be blocked, seeing as there is certainly real competition in the space and MGM has not been able to make its own way \u2014 a sale is almost inevitable. But the review will take place nonetheless, and it will likely elucidate how the FTC has changed its approach to this type of merger.\n It\u2019s entirely possible that even in a light-touch approval of this deal there will be opportunity to see new doctrine in play; for example, Amazon\u2019s arguably monopolistic position in ostensibly unrelated markets is likely to take a greater role than under previous FTC leadership. It may even set the stage for more comprehensive and aggressive reviews to come, or perhaps even rewinding previously approved mergers, something Chair Khan  has said is a distinct possibility.",

significant as it recognizes that Intel will be enabling SiFive\u2019s IP portfolio on its 7nm manufacturing process for upcoming foundry customers. We are expecting Intel to offer a wide variety of its own IP, such as some of the x86 cores, memory controllers, PCIe controllers, and accelerators, however the depth of its third party IP support has not been fully established at this point. SiFive\u2019s IP is the first (we believe) official confirmation of specific IP that will be supported.\n    Announced earlier this year by Pat Gelsinger, Intel Foundry Services (or IFS) is one prong of Intel\u2019s strategy to realign itself with the current and future semiconductor market. Despite having attempted to become a foundry player in the past, whereby they build chips under contract for their customers, it hasn\u2019t really worked out that well \u2013 however IFS is a new reinvigoration of that idea, this time with more emphasis on getting it right and expanding the scope.\n  To that end, Intel has been reorganizing its manufacturing and operations hierarchy into its own vertical group under Keyvan Esfarjani, with IFS led by Randhir Thakur as President reporting to this group.  As reported by CRN in the past week, Intel has recently hired a number of key talents from its foundry competition to aid this transition, including Hong Hao, the former head of Samsung\u2019s North American foundry business, to \u2018 formulate business strategies and execute customer engagement plans\u2019. Intel has also hired Bob Brennan, a former 22 year Intel employee most recently at Micron, as Vice President of Customer Design Enablement at IFS, assisting with end-to-end contract-to-product solutions for IFS customers. This includes engagement with Intel\u2019s Design Engineering Group, putting customers on the right track with Intel roadmaps.\n    Simply offering Intel\u2019s portfolio of technologies alone to customers isn\u2019t going to entice many customers, and in order to compete with other foundry competition, Intel needs to engage with other IP holders to provide design kits and tools for other technologies. For example, if an Intel Foundry Services customer wants to use an Intel core paired with a third party memory controller on Intel\u2019s 14nm process, that third party memory controller design has to be validated at Intel. Similarly, if a customer wants to combine Arm cores or other accelerators, that IP has to be validated. Intel has to create a structure of supported IP aside from their own, and today\u2019s announcement is one of the initial steps to that.\n    Today\u2019s announcement from SiFive is the launch of a new family of \u2018Performance\u2019 cores, debuting with the P270 and the P550. Both cores are Linux capable, with full support for the RISC-V vector extension v1.0rc, and the P550 is SiFive\u2019s highest performance core ever with a reported SPEC2006 int score of 8.65 per GHz. As part of that announcement, Intel is the lead development partner of the P550 core on Intel\u2019s own 7nm process. That\u2019s what the press release says.\n  In our emails with PR however, the wording was a little loose, and stated that\n  Intel recently selected SiFive to work with the Intel Foundry Services (IFS) business  to offer IP to Foundry customers. As part of the growth and development of the IFS business, IFS is creating \u2026 the P550 on the Intel 7nm.\n  The first sentence is critical here; it broadens the scope of the initial press release beyond simple co-operation of a singular IP core (the P550) into something more encompassing. The first step on such an endeavor would obviously be a proof point, such as enabling the P550, but then going beyond to other elements of SiFive\u2019s portfolio. How wide the scope is beyond the P550 has not been commented on at this time, however if all goes well, we could easily imagine a wide remit for SiFive solutions at any foundry.\u00a0 It should be noted that some musings have been made that Intel might be trying to acquire SiFive, however nothing that AnandTech could confirm or get comment on \u2013 the fact that the two companies are putting this announcement out today might dampen those rumors a little.\n  The fact that the press release also mentions 7nm is an interesting angle. We\u2019re covering what Intel is making with SiFive P550 in a separate news article, as it is big enough news to get its own title.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 02:49:26", "source_domain":

Reddit, the self-proclaimed front page of the internet, is determining what should and should not appear on its feeds.\n  When it comes to content moderation, which has become an ever more high-profile problem in recent years, Reddit opts for a different approach compared to other large social platforms.\n  Unlike Facebook, for example, which outsources much of the work to moderation farms, Reddit relies in large part on its communities (or subreddits) to self-police. The efforts of volunteer moderators are guided by rules defined by each individual subreddit, but also a   set of values authored and enforced by Reddit itself.\n  The company has come under criticism for this model, though, which some have interpreted as laissez-faire and lacking in accountability. But Chris Slowe, Reddit CTO, says this is a total mischaracterization.\n  \u201cIt may seem like a crazy thing to say about the internet today, but humans on average are actually pretty good. If you look at Reddit at scale, people are creative, funny, collaborative and derpy - all the things that make civilization work,\u201d he told  TechRadar Pro.\n  \u201cOur underlying approach is that we want communities to set their own cultures, policies and philosophical systems. To make this model function, we need to provide tools and capabilities to deal with the [antisocial] minority.\u201d\n  Slowe was the first ever Reddit employee, hired in 2005 as an engineer after renting out two spare rooms to co-founders Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian. The three had met during the first run of now-infamous accelerator program Y Combinator, which left Slowe with fond memories but also a failed startup and time to fill.\n Although he took a break from Reddit between 2010-2015, Slowe\u2019s experience gives him a unique perspective on the growth of the company and how the challenges it faces have changed over time.\n  In the early years, he says, it was all about scaling up infrastructure to deal with traffic growth. But in his second stint, from 2016 to present, the focus has shifted to trust, security and user safety.\n \u201cWe provide users with tools to report content that violates site policies or rules set by moderators, but not everything is reported. And in some cases, the report is an indication that it\u2019s too late,\u201d he explained.\n \u201cWhen I came back in 2016, one of my main jobs was figuring out precisely how Reddit communities operate and defining what makes the site healthy. Once we had identified symptoms of unhealthiness, we worked from there.\u201d\n   Unlike other social platforms, Reddit has a multi-layered approach to content moderation, which is designed to adhere as closely as possible to the company\u2019s \u201ccommunity-first\u201d ethos.\n The most primitive form of content vetting is performed by the users themselves, who wield the power to upvote items they like and downvote those they don\u2019t. However, while this process boosts popular posts and squashes unpopular ones, popularity is not always a mark of propriety.\n The community mods act as the second line of defence and are armed with the power to remove posts and ban users for breaching guidelines or the content policy. The most common subreddit rule, according to Slowe, is essentially \u201cdon\u2019t be a jerk\u201d.\n The company\u2019s annual   Transparency Report, which breaks down all the content removed from Reddit each year, suggests mods are responsible for roughly two-thirds of all post removals.\n To catch any harmful content missed by the mods, there are the Reddit admins, who are employed by the company directly. These staff members perform manual spot checks, but are also armed with technological tools to help identify problem users and police one-on-one interactions that take place in private.\n \u201cThere are a number of signals we use to surface issues and establish whether individual users are trustworthy and have been acting in good faith,\u201d said Slowe. \u201cThe tricky part is that you\u2019ll never catch it all. And that\u2019s partly because  it is always going to be somewhat grey and context-dependent.\u201d\n Asked how this situation could be improved, Slowe explained he is caught in a difficult position; torn between a desire to uphold the company\u2019s community-first policy and knowledge that there are technologies coming to market that could help catch a greater percentage of abuse.\n For example, Reddit is already beginning to employ advanced  natural language processing (NLP) techniques to more accurately assess the sentiment of interactions between users. Slowe also gestured towards the possibility of using AI to analyze images posted to the platform and conceded that a larger quantity of moderation actions will occur without human input as time goes on.\n However, he also warned of the fallibility of these new systems, which are   prone to bias and certainly capable of error, and the challenges they might pose to the Reddit model.\n \u201cIt\u2019s kind of terrifying, actually. If we\u2019re talking about this as an enforcement model, it\u2019s the same as putting cameras literally everywhere and relying on the great overmind of the machine to tell us when there\u2019s a crime,\u201d he said.\n Although erecting a technological panopticon might limit the amount of unsavory material that lands on the platform, doing so would ultimately require Reddit to cast aside its core philosophy: community above content.\n   Content moderation is a problem that none of the social media giants can claim to have nailed, as demonstrated by the debate surrounding Donald Trump\u2019s accounts and the banning of Parler from app stores. Reddit was also caught up in these conversations, eventually taking the decision to ban the r/DonaldTrump subreddit.\n As powerful as the community-first model may be, there is significant conflict at the heart of Reddit\u2019s approach. The company aspires to give its communities near-total autonomy, but is ultimately forced to make editorial decisions about where to draw the line.\n \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the arbitrary, capricious arbiter of what content is correct and what\u2019s not,\u201d Slowe told us. \u201cBut at the same time, we need to be able to enforce a set of [rules]. It\u2019s a very fine line to walk.\u201d\n Reddit tries to keep its content policy as succinct as possible to eliminate loopholes and make enforcement easier, but revisions are common. For example, revenge pornography was banned on the platform in 2015 under ex-CEO Ellen Pao. Last year, the company added a clause that outlawed the glorification of violence.\n \u201cBeing true to our values also means iterating our values, reassessing them as we encounter new ways to game the system and push the edges,\u201d explained Slowe.\n \u201cWhen we make a change that involves moving communities from one side of the line to the other, that is the end of a long process of figuring out holes in our content policy and working backwards from there.\u201d\n However, while the majority will agree that the absence of revenge porn is an unqualified positive, and that incitement of violence took place on r/The_Donald, both examples are evidence that Reddit has to engage with moderation on the same plane as Facebook, Twitter or any other platform.\n When hard questions need to be asked, in other words, Reddit has found it needs to rely on its own muscle.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 02:48:42", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5229\u7528,moderation,reddit", "title": "Reddit\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u5176\u793e\u533a - \u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9002\u5ea6\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5176\u7528\u6237\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5916\u5305\u5ba1\u6838\u573a ", "title_en": "How Reddit uses its community-first approach to moderate content, relying heavily on its users instead of outsourced moderation farms", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.techradar.com/in/news/how-reddit-turned-its-millions-of-users-into-a-content-moderation-army", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5229\u7528", "reddit"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067525, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4e0b\u8f7dPDF\u6458\u8981\uff1a\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u662f\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\uff06\uff0334; uncthed castle\uff06\uff0334;\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7b49\u751a\u81f3\u4ecd\u7136\u9488\u5bf9\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5047\u8bbe\u63d0\u9ad8\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5ef6\u7eed\u4e86\u4e00\u5927\u96c6\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5173\u8282\u548c\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4f7f\u7528Ajoint Optimization\u4e0a\u641c\u7d22\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u5f0f/\u6df7\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u548c\u5b83\u4eec\u7684ramensidizers\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e0a\u641c\u7d22\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5e8f\u5217/\u6df7\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c13\u4e2a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u5f0f/\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u6765\u63d0\u51fa\u6b63\u89c4\u5316\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9MLP\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5bf9MLP\u7684\u5bf9MLP\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\uff08i\uff09\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6b63\u89c4\u5316\u666e\u901a\u7684MLPSSignight MLPS\u663e\u7740\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u7b51\uff0c\uff08ii\uff09\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4f20\u7edfML\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982XGBoost\u3002\n      \u4e66\u76ee\u5de5\u5177\u4ee3\u7801\uff06amp;\u5173\u4e8eArxivlabs Arxivlabs\u7684\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u8bba\u6587\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e0a\u76f4\u63a5\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u5206\u4eab\u65b0\u7684Arxiv\u529f\u80fd\u3002\n  \u4e0eArxivlabs\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u90fd\u63a5\u53d7\u5e76\u63a5\u53d7\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5f00\u653e\uff0c\u793e\u533a\uff0c\u5353\u8d8a\u548c\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u3002 Arxiv\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\uff0c\u53ea\u4e0e\u9075\u5b88\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u5408\u4f5c\u3002\n  \u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5c06\u589e\u52a0Arxiv\uff06\uff0339;\u793e\u533a\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff1f\u4e86\u89e3\u6709\u5173Arxivlabs\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u3002 ", "note_en": "Download PDF  Abstract: Tabular datasets are the last &#34;unconquered castle&#34; for deep learning, withtraditional ML methods like Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees still performingstrongly even against recent specialized neural architectures. In this paper,we hypothesize that the key to boosting the performance of neural networks liesin rethinking the joint and simultaneous application of a large set of modernregularization techniques. As a result, we propose regularizing plainMultilayer Perceptron (MLP) networks by searching for the optimalcombination/cocktail of 13 regularization techniques for each dataset using ajoint optimization over the decision on which regularizers to apply and theirsubsidiary hyperparameters. We empirically assess the impact of theseregularization cocktails for MLPs on a large-scale empirical study comprising40 tabular datasets and demonstrate that (i) well-regularized plain MLPssignificantly outperform recent state-of-the-art specialized neural networkarchitectures, and (ii) they even outperform strong traditional ML methods,such as XGBoost.\n      Bibliographic Tools      Code &amp; Data      Related Papers       About arXivLabs   arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n  Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n  Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv&#39;s community?

But when NASA\u2019s Voyager spacecraft sailed past them in the late 1970s and 1980s, scientists found that all four worlds were running planetary fevers \u2014 a revelation as jarring as finding a bonfire inside your freezer.\n Follow-up observations by ground-based telescopes and the Galileo and Cassini spacecraft demonstrated that their planet-wide fevers have persisted through time. Their planetary pyrexias are acute: Jupiter\u2019s lower latitudes, for example, should be a frigid \u2212110 degrees Celsius. Instead, the atmosphere there cooks at 325 degrees. What incognito incinerator is behind this? And how is this unknown heat source warming not just a single spot on the planet, but the entire upper atmosphere?\n Scientists have tried to explain this \u201cenergy crisis,\u201d but have remained \u201cconfused for about 50 years,\u201d said  James O\u2019Donoghue, a planetary astronomer at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Now two papers have conclusively revealed where all that heat is coming from: Jupiter and Saturn\u2019s northern and southern lights \u2014 their auroras.\n The results come from detailed measurements of both gas giants\u2019 upper atmospheres. Saturn\u2019s atmospheric temperature was taken by the Cassini spacecraft during the maneuvers that ultimately plunged it into the planet; Jupiter\u2019s was stitched together using a telescope atop a giant Hawaiian volcano. Both show that the atmospheres are hottest near the auroral zones below both magnetic poles. As you approach the equator, the temperature drops off. Clearly, the aurora is bringing the heat \u2014 and, as with a radiator, that heat decreases with distance.\n  A solution to the energy crisis may have far-reaching ramifications. Planets \u2014 from those in our own solar system to those orbiting distant stars \u2014 don\u2019t always keep their atmospheres. Many gassy envelopes are destroyed over time, in some cases turning giant worlds into tiny, uninhabitable husks. Researchers want to be able to distinguish these from habitable, Earth-like planets. If we hope to do so, said  Zarah Brown, a researcher at the University of Arizona, \u201cone of the major parameters that you would want to know is the temperature of the outer atmosphere, since that\u2019s where gas is lost to space.\u201d\n  Earth\u2019s northern and southern lights  aren\u2019t yet completely understood, but the  basics are clear.\n The sun shoots volleys of magnetic fields and energetic particles into space. When these volleys \u2014 better known as the solar wind \u2014 reach our planet, they interact with Earth\u2019s own magnetic bubble, which is known as the magnetosphere. The energetic particles then spiral down to the planet\u2019s north and south magnetic poles. There, they ping off gas atoms and molecules in the upper atmosphere. Those impacts temporarily energize the gases, which emit visible flashes of light.\n In general, auroras require three ingredients: a source of energetic particles, a magnetic field and an atmosphere. Jupiter and Saturn have all three, but neither planet\u2019s auroras are quite like Earth\u2019s.\n  Earth\u2019s magnetic field comes from the churning of liquid nickel-iron alloys deep below our feet. But the gas giants don\u2019t have liquid-iron cores. Instead, the planets\u2019 immense gravity squeezes colossal volumes of liquid hydrogen in their outer cores so hard that the hydrogen\u2019s electrons  pop free. The process turns the hydrogen into a magnetism-generating metal.\n Because these maelstroms of metal hydrogen are so immense, the gas giants\u2019 magnetospheres make Earth\u2019s look lilliputian. Jupiter\u2019s magnetosphere \u201cis the biggest structure in the solar system,\u201d said O\u2019Donoghue. \u201cIts tail goes down to Saturn, and possibly beyond.\u201d\n The gas giants also can\u2019t rely on a plentiful supply of energetic particles, or plasma, from the solar wind, which dissipates with increasing distance from the sun. Instead, they rely on acts of volcanic alchemy.\n Jupiter gets most of its plasma from its moon Io, the most volcanic object known to science. Io\u2019s near-constant magmatic eruptions jettison an abundance of volcanic material into space; there, it bathes in sunlight, becomes electrically excited, then showers down onto Jupiter. Most of Saturn\u2019s plasma comes from Enceladus, a mirrorlike icy moon that fires spectacular jets of frigid watery matter into space.\n  These plasmas shoot into the planets\u2019 expansive magnetospheres, which accelerate them into the poles. There, the charged particles in the plasma collide with gas molecules in the atmosphere.\n Auroras on Saturn emit mostly ultraviolet light; on Jupiter, they\u2019re in both ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths. But the processes that make light aren\u2019t the same as those that make heat. In this case, \u201cit\u2019s all about friction,\u201d said O\u2019Donoghue.\n Plasma flows to the planets\u2019 magnetic poles via field lines \u2014 magnetized tendrils that stretch far into space. These tendrils and their streams rotate along with the planet. But they sometimes struggle to keep pace. Jupiter, for example, rotates once every 10 hours. When those streams of plasma lag behind the planet\u2019s rotation, Jupiter\u2019s powerful westerly winds push through them. The drag of these winds on the slow-moving plasma streams creates friction. And that friction makes heat \u2014 perhaps, in the case of Jupiter, 125 times more heat than the planet gets from the sun. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of nuts,\u201d said O\u2019Donoghue.\n It\u2019s not surprising, then, that astronomers have been wondering if the auroras are the source of those planetary fevers. \u201cFor decades, it was obvious that there was plenty of energy in the aurora,\u201d said  Luke Moore, a senior research scientist at Boston University. But in order to navigate from suspicion to certainty, astronomers needed a map: specifically, a heat map of the gas and ice giants\u2019 upper atmospheres. With it, they could see if the highest temperatures could be superimposed on the auroras, and if this heat was diffusing over the entire planet.\n The first map came from a final act. In April 2017, after 13 years in orbit around Saturn, NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft was commanded to do something remarkable: make 22 orbits of the planet while repeatedly diving between it and its rings. The so-called  Grand Finale, which ended on September 15, 2017, when the spacecraft burned up in Saturn\u2019s clouds, gave Cassini a close-up view of the world like no other.\n  As Cassini passed close to Saturn, it peered through the planet\u2019s atmosphere at the bright stars beyond. The light from these stars appeared to change depending on the density of the atmosphere that the light passed through. A gas\u2019s density and temperature are related, so researchers used dozens of these measurements, known as stellar occultations, to produce detailed heat maps for both the day and night sides of Saturn\u2019s upper atmosphere.\n Published last year in   Nature Astronomy, the heat maps showed a thermal spike around the auroras, and a gentle drop-off in temperatures toward the equator.\n It certainly seemed as if the auroras were responsible. But \u201cif our theory of energy redistribution on Saturn is correct, it would have to work on Jupiter as well,\u201d said Brown, who was the lead author on the Saturn study.\n Now, due to the work by O\u2019Donoghue and his colleagues, it appears that it does.\n Attributing Jupiter\u2019s upper atmospheric fever to its own auroras also required a heat map. But making such a map is far from easy. The planet\u2019s chaotic upper atmosphere changes from week to week. You can\u2019t just take a measurement near the poles on one night, then come back a few weeks later and compare it with a measurement near the equator. In time, the skies will shift significantly, and evidence of any heat flows will be lost.\n What researchers needed was a global heat map made during a relatively brief moment in time \u2014 one that showed the flow of heat over several hours.\n O\u2019Donoghue, Moore and company turned to the Keck Observatory atop Hawai\u2018i\u2019s dormant Mauna Kea volcano. They used it to observe Jupiter in infrared light over two nights \u2014 April 14, 2016, and January 25, 2017 \u2014 for five hours apiece. During the course of each night they created a high-resolution heat map of Jupiter\u2019s day side. Both maps clearly showed temperatures peaking around the auroral zones, hitting a staggering 730 degrees Celsius. This thermal zenith gradually declined as you approached the equator, where the mercury still hit an impressive 325 degrees.\n  Their results, currently available in a  preprint that has been accepted to  Nature, harmonize with what Cassini saw at Saturn. The results have been taken as hard proof that the auroras can solve the energy crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s a big step forward, seeing that it\u2019s auroral heating,\u201d said  Rosie Johnson, a space physics researcher at Aberystwyth University in Wales who wasn\u2019t involved with either paper.\n Licia Ray, a space and planetary physics researcher at Lancaster University in England who is also not involved with either paper, praises the Saturn study\u2019s rigorous data set. But she is less convinced by the Jupiter paper. \u201cThey\u2019re only using two nights of data, and I find that to be an issue,\u201d she said. But despite her misgivings, \u201cI think the temperature gradient result [at Jupiter] probably will hold, because they\u2019ve seen it at Saturn,\u201d she said.\n Having comparatively few observations is \u201ca fair concern, because these are very dynamic places, these giant planets,\u201d said Moore. Additional nights of Jupiter observations have been collected and are currently being processed.\n In any event, most independent researchers seem convinced that the planet-wide fevers are down to the auroras. These papers provide \u201ca really nice confirmation that what we suspected was happening is actually happening,\u201d said  Leigh Fletcher, a planetary scientist at the University of Leicester in England who was not involved with the work. \u201cEnergy is leaking from the auroral domain down into the lower latitudes.\u201d The question is: How?\n  The majority of atmospheric circulation models struggle to move heat from the aurora through Jupiter and Saturn\u2019s screeching westward winds to the equator \u2014 at yet, their heat maps show that these tempestuous hurdles are somehow being overcome.\n One potential  solution was inspired by Cassini\u2019s observations. Cassini discovered that, on occasion, a disturbance to a lower layer of Saturn\u2019s atmosphere can cause that layer to migrate to the upper atmosphere. Such an inversion may disrupt and slow down the upper atmosphere\u2019s powerful westward winds \u2014 perhaps enough to allow the auroral heat to leak through.\n  In theory, this mechanism could apply to Jupiter too. But the upper atmospheres of gas giants lack clouds \u2014 clear markers of movement \u2014 which makes studying winds there \u201cfiendishly challenging,\u201d said Fletcher. For now, this part of the energy crisis remains a riddle without a resolution.\n O\u2019Donoghue\u2019s team suspects that a second process might help distribute heat around Jupiter. Occasionally, intense solar wind activity will exert pressure on Jupiter\u2019s magnetosphere, squeezing it. Prior work  indicated that when this compression happens, Io\u2019s plasma streams can get quickly pushed into the upper atmosphere. The additional plasma gives those powerful westward winds more to push through, which could produce a heating spike.\n Such a spike may have been seen during the recent surveys. Around the time of the January 25, 2017, observation, when solar wind activity was relatively high, the already hot upper atmosphere spiked in temperature. The team simultaneously spotted a curious high-temperature structure moving from the auroral zones toward the equator. These phenomena were not seen during the April 14, 2016, observation, when the solar wind activity was relatively quiet.\n  The team speculates that a burst of solar wind activity in early 2017 may have pinched the planet\u2019s magnetosphere. But other factors could also be in play. Ray speculates that an uptick in volcanic activity on Io may provide an alternative explanation. Without more observations, they can\u2019t be certain one way or the other, said O\u2019Donoghue.\n Despite these lingering quandaries, the conclusive identification of the auroras as Jupiter and Saturn\u2019s atmospheric arsonists has significantly bolstered our understanding of these worlds. Uranus and Neptune, however, remain shrouded in a thick fog of uncertainty. They have different atmospheres, magnetic fields and rotational behaviors \u2014 \u201cthey\u2019re wacky,\u201d said Brown \u2014 meaning what works for the gas giants may not work for the ice giants. They\u2019re so far away that we struggle to see either in detail using Earth\u2019s telescopes, and it looks as though they  won\u2019t be visited by another spacecraft for the foreseeable future.

Al-Alam goes back to 2003 and is broadcast in Arabic, Farsi and English to audiences in the Middle East and the Mediterranean.\n The FBI &amp; the obscure Bureau of Industry &amp; Security, an agency birthed in 2001 with the task advancing &#34;national security, foreign policy, &amp; economic objectives&#34; - have shut down Press TV.

The TV channel is headquartered in Beirut, Lebanon.\n Well that\u2019s a metric butt-ton of images &amp; videos of events in Yemen gone from the internet.  https://t.co/0QlLKKSZAu\n\u2014 Nick Waters (@N_Waters89)  June 22, 2021\n Neither the US nor the Iranian authorities have commented on the seizures just yet. Meanwhile, the NGO Yemen Solidarity Council (YSC)\u00a0 condemned\u00a0 \u201cthe deliberate silencing of the Yemeni voice by the American regime.\u201d\n In a statement released through the YSC, Al Masirah said it was  \u201cnot surprised\u201d by the apparent seizure, as it  \u201ccomes from those that have supervised the most heinous crimes against our people.\u201d\n The \u201cban \u201d on the website  \u201creveals, once again, the falsehood of the slogans of freedom of expression and all the other headlines promoted by the United States of America, including its inability to confront the truth,\u201d the outlet said.\n &#34;This American ban on the Al Masirah Net website and other friendly website reveals, once again, the falsehood of the slogans of freedom of expression and all the other headlines promoted by the United States of America, including its inability to confront the truth.&#34;\n\u2014 Rune Agerhus (@Aldanimarki)  June 22, 2021\n In the absence of any official word, there has been speculation that the domains may have been hacked instead. Furthermore, the seizures appear to have affected only the .com and .net domains that are under US jurisdiction. PressTV remains available at the .ir domain.\n We firmly oppose the apparent U.S. seizure of news websites, state-run or otherwise. This sets a dangerous precedent. Iran&#39;s  @PressTV, Al-Alam along w/ Yemeni&#39;s Al Masirah are showing this graphic. Still some debate that they&#39;ve been hacked.

He also said the Iranian ballistic missile program was  \u201cnot up for negotiation.\u201d\n              While the Trump administration took a hard-line approach to Iran, imposing unprecedented sanctions and even  assassinating a senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps general \u2013 resulting in Iranian missile strikes against US bases in Iraq \u2013 it never moved against media outlets. The Biden administration was thought to be open for relaxing tensions.\n WTF???

Media reports have tallied  over 2,100 deaths, but federal health authorities have not released an official death count.\n Past medical reviews have estimated that the fungal infection\u2014mucormycosis\u2014has an overall fatality rate of around 50 percent. However, mortality rates vary by patients\u2019 underlying condition and what part of the body the mucormycetes fungi invade. Infection can take hold in the gastrointestinal tract, skin breaks, lungs, and the blood.\n In India, the fungi appear to be mainly taking root in the nose and sinuses, where they can spread to facial bones, eyes, and even the brain. Once an infection is established, it can quickly become aggressive and lead to tissue death. If it spreads to the eye, many patients end up permanently losing vision and, in some cases, need to have their eye entirely removed to keep the infection from spreading.\n    Mucormycetes are a ubiquitous group of molds, and they typically only strike immunocompromised patients, such as those with diabetes. The soil-lurking molds love acidic conditions, making patients with  diabetic ketoacidosis\u2014a complication in which the blood becomes acidic\u2014particularly vulnerable.\n Medical experts hypothesize that the current surge of mucormycosis in India is down to a confluence of factors related to the COVID-19 wave. Many of the cases are occurring in people who are recovering or have recently recovered from COVID-19. The combination of poor hygiene amid the health crisis, the country\u2019s large number of people with diabetes\u2014particularly uncontrolled diabetes\u2014and  an over-reliance on glucocorticoid steroids appear to be playing a role in the fungal epidemic. Steroid use can help treat COVID-19, but it can also tamp down immune responses and make people vulnerable to opportunistic infections, such as mucormycosis.\n An expert in fungal infections referred to the situation as \u201c triple whammy,\u201d as Ars reported previously.\n In recent days, media reports out of India have noted  children having their eyes surgically removed because of fungal infections, local governments  declaring epidemics, and  black-market sales of treatments for mucormycosis.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 02:46:31", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u771f\u83cc,fungus,\u611f\u67d3", "title": "\u201c\u9ed1\u8272\u771f\u83cc\u201d\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u98d9\u5347 -

It is located 9.2 billion light-years away and stretches across roughly a 15th of the observable universe.\n  Its discovery was &#34;serendipitous,&#34; Alexia Lopez, a doctoral candidate in cosmology at the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) in the U.K., told Live Science. Lopez was assembling maps of objects in the night sky using the light from about 120,000   quasars \u2014 distant bright cores of galaxies where supermassive   black holes are consuming material and spewing out energy.\n   As this light passes through matter between us and the quasars, it is absorbed by different elements, leaving telltale traces that can give researchers important information. In particular, Lopez used marks left by   magnesium to determine the distance to the intervening gas and dust, as well as the material\u2019s position in the night sky.\n  In this way, the quasars act &#34;like spotlights in a dark room, illuminating this intervening matter,&#34; Lopez said.\n In the midst of the cosmic maps, a structure began to emerge. &#34;It was sort of a hint of a big arc,&#34; Lopez said. &#34;I remember going to Roger [Clowes] and saying &#39;Oh, look at this.&#39;&#34;\n Clowes, her doctoral adviser at UCLan, suggested further analysis to ensure it wasn&#39;t some chance alignment or a trick of the data. After doing two different statistical tests, the researchers determined that there was less than a 0.0003% probability the Giant Arc wasn&#39;t real. They presented their results on June 7 at the 238th virtual meeting of the American Astronomical Society.\n   But the finding, which will take its place in the list of biggest things in the cosmos, undermines a bedrock expectation about the universe. Astronomers have long adhered to what&#39;s known as the cosmological principle, which states that, at the largest scales, matter is more or less evenly distributed throughout space.\n The Giant Arc bigger than other enormous assemblies, such as the Sloan Great Wall and the   South Pole Wall, each of which are dwarfed by even larger cosmic features.\n &#34;There have been a number of large-scale structures discovered over the years,&#34; Clowes told Live Science. &#34;They&#39;re so large, you wonder if they&#39;re compatible with the cosmological principle.&#34;\n  The fact that such colossal entities have clumped together in particular corners of the cosmos indicates that perhaps material isn\u2019t distributed evenly around the universe.\n But the current standard model of the universe is founded on the cosmological principle, Lopez added. &#34;If we&#39;re finding it not to be true, maybe we need to start looking at a different set of theories or rules.&#34;\n Lopez doesn&#39;t know what those theories would look like, though she mentioned the idea of modifying how gravity works on the largest scales, a possibility that has been popular with a small but loud contingent of scientists in recent years.\n Daniel Pomar\u00e8de, a cosmographer at Paris-Saclay University in France who co-discovered the South Pole Wall, agreed that the cosmological principle should dictate a theoretical limit to the size of cosmic entities.\n Some research has suggested that structures should reach a certain size and then be unable to get larger, Pomar\u00e8de told Live Science. &#34;Instead, we keep finding these bigger and bigger structures.&#34;\n Yet he isn&#39;t quite ready to toss out the cosmological principle, which has been used in models of the universe for about a century. &#34;It would be very bold to say that it will be replaced by something else,&#34; he said.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 02:46:08", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u62c9\u4f38,arc,\u5b87\u5b99", "title": "\u201c\u5de8\u578b\u5f27\u201d\u62c9\u4f383.3B\u6d45\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u5e74\u4e0d\u5e94\u8be5\u5b58\u5728 ", "title_en": "'Giant arc' stretching 3.3B light-years across the cosmos shouldn't exist", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.livescience.com/giant-arc-in-space.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u62c9\u4f38", "arc", "\u5b87\u5b99"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "9da3d2feb91344e7033900a60d5f38ee.jpg", "infoid": 1067520, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u6c7d\u8f66\u96c6\u56e2\u5468\u4e8c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u5df2\u6b63\u5f0f\u5b8c\u6210\u5176\u6536\u8d2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u516c\u53f8\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u8be5\u4ea4\u6613\u4e8e12\u6708\u5ba3\u5e03\uff0c\u4f30\u503c\u7684\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u52a8\u529b\u91cf\u4e3a11\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u8d2d\u4e70SEES Hyundai\u5728\u516c\u53f8\u4e2d\u62ff\u8d77\u4e8680\uff05\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u80a1\u6743\uff0c\u524d\u4efb\u6240\u6709\u8005\u8f6f\u94f6\u884c\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e8620\uff05\u7684\u6240\u6709\u6743\u3002\n \u8fd9\u7b14\u4ea4\u6613\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u4e3a\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u52a8\u6001\u521b\u9020\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5bb6\uff0c\u8fd9\u7ee7\u7eed\u907f\u5f00\u4e16\u754c\uff06\uff0339;\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6301\u7eed\u6240\u6709\u6743\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6700\u4ee4\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4e8e1992\u5e74\u7684\u9ebb\u7701\u7406\u5de5\u5b66\u9662\u8fc5\u901f\u6446\u8131\uff0c\u5e76\u5e78\u5b58\u4e8eDARPA\u7814\u7a76\u8865\u52a9\u91d1\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u751f\u6d3b\u3002\u8c37\u6b4c\u57282013\u5e74\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u662fAndroid\u8054\u5408\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u5b89\u5353\u00b7\u9c81\u5bbe\u9886\u5bfc\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u7b80\u8981\u5174\u8da3\u3002\u8c37\u6b4c\u91ca\u653e\u4e86\u516c\u53f8\u5bf9\u519b\u4e8b\u5408\u540c\u7684\u5e78\u5b58\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5f53\u9c81\u5bbe\u4e00\u5e74\u540e\u7559\u4e0b\u8c37\u6b4c\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u884c\u653f\u5229\u76ca\u7559\u4e0b\u4e86\u4ed6\u3002\n  \u8c37\u6b4c\u5c06\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u52a8\u529b\u9500\u552e\u7ed9\u65e5\u672c\u63a7\u80a1\u516c\u53f8Softbank 2017\u5e74\uff0c\u62a5\u544a\u4e861.65\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u9707\u60ca\u7684\u4f4e\u4ef7\u3002\u52302020\u5e7412\u6708\uff0cSoftBank\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u4e00\u4e9b\u6295\u8d44\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5357\uff08\u4f18\u6b65\uff0cWework\uff0cOneWeb\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u59cb\u9500\u552e\u50cf\u80f3\u818a\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u7687\u51a0\u73e0\u5b9d\u3002\u73b0\u4ee3\u5e0c\u671b\u6295\u8d44\u66f4\u591a\uff06\uff0334;\u79fb\u52a8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u8f6f\u94f6\u80fd\u591f\u7ffb\u8f6c\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u52a8\u6001\u4ee5\u6574\u7406\u5229\u6da6\u3002\u6536\u8d2d\u5bf9\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u975e\u5e38\u4ee4\u4eba\u5174\u594b\u3002\u867d\u7136\u516c\u53f8\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u6405\u62cc\u884c\u4e1a\u9886\u5148\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e74\u4ee3\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4e00\u76f4\u90fd\u662f\u7eaf\u7cb9\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ea\u5f00\u59cb\u9500\u552e\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c74,500\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u72d7\uff06\uff0334;\u73b0\u8d27\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u4e00\u5e74\u524d\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5c06\u9500\u552e\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624d\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u6709\u5229\u53ef\u56fe\uff0c\u5219\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4e0d\u662f\u5f88\u591a\u516c\u53f8\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u96f6\u4ef6\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u4ea7\uff0c\u4f46\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u5546\u4f3c\u4e4e\u975e\u5e38\u9002\u5408\u4e00\u5bb6\u53ef\u4ee5\u8df3\u8dc3\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u3002\n    \u7531\u4e8e\u62e5\u6709\u73b0\u4ee3\u6c7d\u8f66\u516c\u53f8 - \uff06\uff0334;

The deal was  announced in December\u00a0and valued Boston Dynamics at $1.1 billion. The purchase sees Hyundai pick up an 80 percent controlling stake in the company, with the previous owner, Softbank, retaining 20 percent ownership.\n The deal will hopefully create a stable home for Boston Dynamics, which has continued to pump out the world&#39;s most impressive robots despite continual ownership changes. The company was spun off from MIT in 1992 and survived for most of its life on DARPA research grants. Google acquired the independent Boston Dynamics in 2013 as part of a brief interest in robotics led by Android co-founder Andy Rubin. Google freed the company from surviving on military contracts, but when  Rubin left Google a year later, the executive interest in robotics left with him.\n  Google sold Boston Dynamics to the Japanese holding company Softbank in 2017 for  a reported\u00a0$165 million, a shockingly low price. By December 2020, Softbank found itself in dire financial straits after some of its other investments went south (Uber, WeWork, OneWeb) and started selling off crown jewels  like Arm. Hyundai wanted to invest in more &#34;mobility solutions,&#34; and Softbank was able to flip Boston Dynamics for a tidy profit. The acquisition is pretty exciting for Boston Dynamics. While the company has been churning out industry-leading robotics work for years, it has all been pure research. Boston Dynamics only started selling a product, the  $74,500 robotic dog &#34;Spot,&#34;\u00a0one year ago. If Boston Dynamics is ever going to sell enough robots to be profitable, getting costs down is essential. Not many companies specialize in the mass production of robotics parts and components, but a car manufacturer seems like a pretty good fit for a company that could make the jump.\n    Hyundai Motor Group is a top-5 vehicle manufacturer thanks to owning Hyundai Motor\u00a0 Company\u2014the &#34;Hyundai&#34; car brand you&#39;ve been thinking of this whole time\u2014and Kia Motors. Hyundai Motor Group also owns  Hyundai Rotem\u2014maker of trains, manufacturing equipment, and  military tanks\u00a0(!)\u2014along with the Hyundai racing team and Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction.\u00a0If this is starting to sound complicated, welcome to the world of South Korean conglomerates. Hyundai Motor Group is the second-largest behind Samsung Group. Don&#39;t confuse the Hyundai Motor Group with  all these other companies that start with &#34;Hyundai.&#34;\n  The good news for Boston Dynamics is that Hyundai has tons of experience in building production lines, designing parts for mass production, and saving money via economies of scale. These are all things a formerly research-focused robotics company probably doesn&#39;t have much expertise in.\n  The press release says as much: &#34;The deal is also expected to allow the [Hyundai Motor] Group and Boston Dynamics to leverage each other\u2019s respective strengths in manufacturing, logistics, construction and automation. Together, the Group and Boston Dynamics will create a robotics value chain, from robot component manufacturing to smart logistics solutions. Additionally, the Group will support Boston Dynamics\u2019 continued expansion of its product line and global sales and service footprint.&#34; Boston Dynamics has sold &#34;hundreds&#34; of units of its Spot robotic dog (including  to SpaceX) for at least $74,500 each. There are\u00a0a host of accessories for Spot, like a charging dock, a  robotic arm that lets it open doors and turn valves, and various cameras for remote inspection of dangerous areas.

But while today&#39;s  patch notes detailed most of these changes, one unexpected error popped up for some players: a new on-screen display, which can&#39;t be disabled, that shows each player&#39;s home IP address.\n The news emerged primarily as Twitch game streamers began jumping into the game and hosting their sessions to fans, only to notice the line of text\u2014which also  includes the player&#39;s console username (\u00e0 la Xbox&#39;s &#34;Gamertag&#34;) and other apparent numerical indicators\u2014not only appeared on-screen but began bouncing from the top to the bottom of the screen in a way that would prevent a streamer from easily cropping the details for privacy&#39;s sake. In a rush to showcase the game&#39;s new content to their Twitch audience, many streamers inadvertently revealed that information to their audiences.\n The game&#39;s social media account acknowledged the issue shortly after players began complaining about it, though they did so somewhat disingenuously by describing the IP address leak as merely &#34; a floating string of text.&#34; An hour later, the same social media account asked players to &#34;refrain from streaming&#34; the game for the time being while an internal investigation was taking place. Shortly after, the developer  owned up to the issue\u00a0while saying that it was isolated to PlayStation 5 consoles.\n    As far as casual gameplay goes, this is merely a visual nuisance, but anyone interested in either streaming the game or sharing clips or screenshots would be wise to take Crystal Dynamics&#39; advice and lock your play down for the time being. Your home IP address is not your last line of Internet defense by any means, and it may be assigned by your ISP in dynamic fashion, but it&#39;s still the kind of personally identifying information that you don&#39;t want to freely share online\u2014especially if your favorite streaming chat room includes bored ne&#39;er-do-wells who might leverage that IP address for notorious means. (Though, really, you should double-check your home computing environment to ensure that an IP address leak doesn&#39;t spell doom for your devices or connection.)\n    While Crystal Dynamics has yet to clarify why this happened, it&#39;s quite possible that this identifier string is inherited from an internal testing version of the game, perhaps used by remote QA testers who can&#39;t go to an office to test unfinished patch content. I&#39;ve seen bouncing-text identifiers many times in a post-pandemic game-criticism world, primarily when I&#39;m invited to play unannounced or early versions of new games and am asked not to record my footage.\u00a0Many video game developers employ similar practices while sharing unfinished game content across a global remote workforce.\n Today&#39;s bad news follows the game&#39;s lengthy development process,  mediocre critical reception, and issues with update cadence, since its always-online nature was met with expectations of regularly expanded and fleshed-out content that hasn&#39;t necessarily arrived. Development slowdown has included an apparent delay to the PlayStation-exclusive addition of the superhero Spider-Man, which still doesn&#39;t have a release date for PlayStation consoles.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 02:08:55", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5730\u5740,avengers,\u6e38\u620f", "title": "Marvel\u7684\u590d\u4ec7\u8005\u66f4\u65b0\u95ea\u70c1\u5c4f\u5e55\u4e0a\u7684IP\u5730\u5740\uff0cDev\u627f\u8bfa\u4fee\u590d ", "title_en": "Marvel\u2019s Avengers update flashes IP addresses on screen, dev promises fix", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/marvels-avengers-update-flashes-ip-address-on-screen-dev-promises-fix/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5730\u5740", "avengers", "\u6e38\u620f"]}]
