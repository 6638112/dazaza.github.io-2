She had nearly two decades of experience leading diversity and inclusion efforts inside important institutions, like Washington state’s governor’s office, but she’d never worked at an influential global business leader like Amazon.</p><p>当Chanin Kelly-Rae于2019年开始在亚马逊工作作为公司云计算部门的全球经理，她对她的新工作有了很大的雄心壮志。她在华盛顿州的总督办公室等重要机构中拥有近二十年的经验，其领先的多样性和融入努力，但她从未在像亚马逊这样的有影响力的全球商业领袖工作。</p><p> But less than a year later, Kelly-Rae quit. Her tenure inside the company convinced her that Amazon’s corporate workplace has deep, systemic issues that disadvantage Black employees and workers from other underrepresented backgrounds. And she was dismayed by her perception that Amazon leadership was unwilling to listen to internal experts about how to identify and fix these problems.</p><p> 但不到一年后，Kelly-Rae戒掉了。她的任期内在公司内心深信，亚马逊的企业工作场所具有深刻的系统性问题，缺乏黑人员工和来自其他特殊的背景的工人。她感到沮丧，因为她的看法，亚马逊领导力不愿意倾听关于如何识别和解决这些问题的内部专家。</p><p> “Amazon was not doing things in a way that represents best practices that would advance diversity and inclusion in any way that is meaningful and thoughtful,” she told Recode. “Let me add: Amazon appeared to be taking steps backward instead of forward.”</p><p> “亚马逊并没有以一种代表最佳做法的方式做事，这些做法将以有意义和周到的任何方式推进多样性和包容性，”她告诉回收。 “让我添加：亚马逊似乎正在倒退而不是前进。”</p><p>  Kelly-Rae, who is Black, is one of more than a dozen former and current Amazon corporate employees — 10 of whom are Black — who told Recode in interviews over the past few months that they felt the company has failed to create a corporate-wide environment where all Black employees feel welcomed and respected. Instead, they told Recode that, in their experience, Black employees at the company often face both direct and insidious bias that harms their careers and personal lives. All of the current and former employees, other than Kelly-Rae, spoke on condition of anonymity either because of the terms of their employment with Amazon or because they fear retribution from Amazon for speaking out about their experiences.</p><p>  黑名单的Kelly-Rae是十多个前者和当前的亚马逊公司员工 -  10人，其中10名是黑人的 - 在过去的几个月里，他们在过去几个月里被召开了，他们认为公司未能创造企业 - 所有黑人员工都感到欢迎和尊重的广阔环境。相反，他们告诉回收，在他们的经验中，公司的黑人员工经常面临直接和​​阴险的偏见，损害他们的职业生命和个人生活。除了与亚马逊的就业条款之外，所有当前和前雇员都谈到了匿名的条件，或者因为他们害怕亚马逊的报复，以便谈论他们的经历。</p><p> Current and former Amazon diversity and inclusion professionals — employees whose work focuses on helping Amazon create and maintain an equitable workplace and products — told Recode that internal data shows that Amazon’s review and promotion systems have created an unlevel playing field. Black employees receive “least effective” marks more often than all other colleagues and are promoted at a lower rate than non-Black peers. Recode reviewed some of this data for the Amazon Web Services division of the company, and it shows large disparities in performance review ratings between Black and white employees.</p><p> 当前和前任亚马逊多样性和包容专业人员 - 工作侧重于帮助亚马逊创造和维护公平的工作场所和产品的员工 - 告诉回收内部数据显示亚马逊的审查和促销系统创建了一个不展开的播放领域。黑人员工比所有其他同事都经过“最低有效”的标记，并以低于非黑同行的速度升级。重新介绍公司的亚马逊Web服务部门的一些数据，它显示了黑白员工之间的绩效审查评级的巨大差异。</p><p> “We struggle to bring [Black] folks in because there’s not a whole lot of desire, in my opinion, to go outside of our normal practices,” a current Amazon diversity manager told Recode. “And then when they do get here, it’s harder to get promoted, harder to get top-tier rated, and easier to get lowest-tier. All those things combined make it so folks don’t wanna stay. And folks will leave Amazon and go take on more senior roles elsewhere.”</p><p> “我们努力带来[黑色]人民，因为在我看来，在我们看来，在我们的正常做法之外没有大量的愿望，”目前的亚马逊多样性经理告诉回收。 “然后当他们确实到这里时，升级更难，更难获得顶级评级，更容易获得最低层。所有这些事情都结合起来，所以人们不想留下来。人们会离开亚马逊，并在其他地方接受更多的高级角色。“</p><p>  “We disagree with this characterization of Amazon’s culture and believe that it misrepresents the facts and is based on the views of a small number of individuals.”</p><p>  “我们不同意亚马逊文化的这种特征，并相信它歪曲了事实，是基于少数个人的意见。” </p><p>  We work hard to build an inclusive culture that welcomes, celebrates, and values all people, but we’re disappointed if even one person has a negative experience. Teams across Amazon have hired hundreds of thousands of Black employees and thousands of Black managers, and our retention data and employee surveys illustrate that they have similar attrition rates and greater job satisfaction and feelings of inclusion than their non-Black colleagues. We recognize we have work to do, including increasing Black representation at all levels, and we set — and met — aggressive goals to double the representation of Black Vice Presidents and Directors in 2020 and are committing to do so again in 2021. We encourage anyone to compare our goals and progress towards achieving those goals with other large employers.</p><p>我们努力建立一个包容性的文化，欢迎，庆祝和价值所有人，但如果甚至一个人甚至有一个人有负面的经历，我们都会失望。亚马逊的团队雇用了数十万黑人员工和数千名黑色管理人员，我们的保留数据和员工调查说明了他们具有类似的磨损率和更高的工作满意度和比非黑人同事的纳入感。我们认识到我们有工作要做，包括增加各级的黑色代表，我们设定 - 并达到了攻击目标，以便在2020年的黑人副总统和董事的代表加倍，并在2021年致力于再次这样做。我们鼓励任何人比较我们的目标和进展与其他大型雇主实现这些目标。</p><p> Some of those who spoke to Recode recounted what they saw as biased interactions inside Amazon’s corporate offices, including a white male manager who told a Black female employee, unprompted, that his ancestors “owned slaves but I’m pretty sure they were good to their slaves.” Others described microaggressions like being called out by managers and peers for not smiling or being friendly enough.</p><p> 一些人发言的人叙述了他们在亚马逊的公司办公室内部看到的偏见互动，包括一名白色男性经理，他们告诉黑色女性员工，没有突出，他的祖先“拥有奴隶，但我很确定他们对他们很好奴隶。“其他人描述了像管理者和同龄人被召唤出来的微不足道，因为不笑着或友好。</p><p> They told Recode that even when they reported these kinds of interactions to human resources, the offending colleagues often faced few or no repercussions, especially in cases where there were no other witnesses. Many of these employees work or worked for Amazon Web Services, the division of Amazon that is run by longtime Amazon executive  Andy Jassy, whom Jeff Bezos recently announced will succeed him as Amazon CEO later this year. Still, several said they believe that Jassy cares about systemic racism impacting Black Americans inside and outside of the company.</p><p> 他们告诉回收率，即使他们报告了对人力资源的这些互动，违规的同事往往面临着几乎没有或没有反冲，特别是在没有其他证人的情况下。这些员工的许多员工工作或为亚马逊网络服务工作，亚马逊的亚马逊部门被长期亚马逊行政安迪Jassy经营，杰夫贝斯最近宣布的亚马逊将在今年晚些时候成功担任亚马逊首席执行官。尽管如此，有几个人认为，他们认为Jassy关心系统性的种族主义，影响公司内外的黑人美国人。</p><p>  The employees Recode interviewed said the racial bias they encountered at Amazon affected them in a multitude of meaningful ways: Four of the Black women who spoke to Recode said they sought mental health counseling while at Amazon, either solely or in large part because of their experience working at the company. Some workers said treatment from colleagues and managers compelled them to leave the company, even though they’d once viewed it as the opportunity of their dreams. And some stuck it out at the company by transferring roles, and even taking demotions, to escape toxic bosses. One current employee said she’s still at Amazon because she believes she can make a difference.</p><p>  雇员撰写受访者表示，他们在亚马逊遇到的种族偏见影响了他们的众多有意义的方式：四个被召回的黑人女性们说，他们在亚马逊的时候，他们在亚马逊时求咨询，而不是他们的经历在公司工作。一些工人说，同事和经理的治疗使他们离开公司，即使他们曾经将其视为他们梦想的机会。有些通过转移角色而甚至采取降级，逃避有毒的老板，有些并在公司困扰着公司。当前员工表示，她仍然在亚马逊，因为她相信她可以有所作为。</p><p>   Some of those interviewed said that not all teams and managers perpetuate these racial biases at the company. And several told Recode they were heartened when company leaders, including Bezos, spoke out publicly last year to condemn police killings of Black Americans and to support the Black Lives Matter movement.</p><p>   其中一些采访说，并非所有团队和经理都延续了公司的这些种族偏见。几位告诉回收他们在包括贝斯科斯在内的公司领导人去年宣称警察杀害黑人美国人并支持黑人生活的杀戮。</p><p> But they all said their view is that the company is plagued by systemic issues that disproportionately harm Black employees — and several faulted the company’s senior leadership team, known as the S-team, for not focusing enough on identifying and implementing the right strategies to fix the biases. Some employees also told Recode that they think the human resources division has not done enough to root out employees that they feel have discriminated against them or their Black colleagues.</p><p> 但他们都说他们的观点是，该公司是由不成比例地伤害黑人员工的系统问题 - 以及公司高级领导团队的有关S-Team的几个错误，因为没有专注于确定和实施正确的解决方案偏见。一些员工还告诉回收，他们认为人力资源部门尚未足以扎根员工，他们认为他们遭受了他们或他们的黑人同事。</p><p> And these issues extend far beyond Amazon’s corporate workforce, as seen last spring after Amazon fired a Black warehouse manager named Christian Smalls, who had organized a small employee walkout at a facility to protest what the group said were inadequate health protections for workers during the early weeks of the pandemic. Amazon’s top lawyer, David Zapolsky, later referred to Smalls as “not smart, or articulate” in notes from a meeting with Bezos and other company leaders. After these notes  leaked to the press,  Amazon white-collar employees fumed over the treatment of Smalls and Zapolsky’s choice of words, which were viewed as offensive at best and racist at worst.</p><p> 这些问题远远超出了亚马逊的公司劳动力，如去年春天在亚马逊发射了一个名为Christian Smalls的黑色仓库经理，他们组织了一个小型员工罢工，以抗议该集团在早期的工作人员的健康保护不足大流行的周。亚马逊的顶级律师David Zapolsky，后来将小于与贝佐和其他公司领导人的会晤的笔记中“不聪明的，或表达”。在这些笔记泄露到新闻界之后，亚马逊白领员工对少数和ZAPOLSKY的单词的治疗感到沮丧，这在最糟糕的是最佳和种族主义的令人反感。 </p><p>  These allegations matter because the company is the second-largest private sector employer in the US, and how Amazon hires, treats, and retains Black employees directly impacts the hundreds of thousands of people who work for the tech giant. Beyond that, Amazon’s runaway success makes it a model for other businesses that try to emulate its internal culture and labor practices. But it also matters because Amazon runs businesses across varied industries — from retail to media to cloud computing to  facial recognition software — and the decisions its leaders make, and experiences and points of view that inform their decisions, have the power to positively or negatively affect tens of millions of other Americans far outside of Amazon’s walls.</p><p>这些指控物质是本公司是美国第二大私营部门雇主，以及亚马逊如何雇用，对待和保留黑人员工直接影响为科技巨头工作的数十万人。除此之外，亚马逊的失控成功使其成为试图模仿其内部文化和劳动惯例的其他业务的模型。但它也很重要，因为亚马逊在各种行业上运行业务 - 从零售到媒体到云计算到面部识别软件 - 以及其领导者的决定，以及通知他们的决定的经验和观点，具有积极或负面影响的权力在亚马逊的墙壁之外，数以万计的其他美国人。</p><p> Kelly-Rae, for her part, said Amazon’s massive reach and power come with great responsibility.</p><p> 为了她的部分，亚马逊的大规模覆盖力和力量具有巨大的责任，凯利-Rae表示。</p><p> “They have access to our lives in more ways than any other company,” she said. “The best thing they can do when creating opportunity is make sure that opportunity is enjoyed universally and not kept from some because of who they are.”</p><p> “他们比任何其他公司更多地进入我们的生活，”她说。 “在创造机会时，他们可以做的最好的事情是确保普遍享受机会，而不是因为他们是谁而不受影响。”</p><p> “Amazon is really good at things it wants to be good at,” she added, “and if Amazon decided it really wanted to be good at this, I have no doubt it can be.”</p><p> “亚马逊真的很擅长它想要擅长的东西，”她补充道，“如果亚马逊决定真的很想擅长这一点，我毫不怀疑它可以。”</p><p>  Kelly-Rae was only a month into her job as a diversity and inclusion leader for a department in Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud computing division, when she started to realize the work ahead would be daunting.</p><p>  Kelly-Rae只是一个月的工作，作为亚马逊网络服务部门的多样性和包容领导者，这是公司的云计算司，当时她开始意识到未来的工作将令人生畏。</p><p> She had gathered with the rest of Amazon’s diversity and inclusion employees at the company’s Seattle, Washington, headquarters for an inaugural all-staff meeting in January 2020, shortly before the Covid-19 pandemic turned the world upside down.</p><p> 她在公司的西雅图，华盛顿的总部为2020年1月的亚马逊，华盛顿总工作人员会议上聚集了亚马逊的其他多样性和包容员工，在Covid-19流行病颠倒了世界之前，不久之后很快就会倒置。</p><p> The teams had gathered for the first-annual internal diversity summit to share feedback, learn from their peers and leaders, and discuss goals and the right strategies to meet them.</p><p> 该团队聚集在一起为第一届年度内部多样性峰会分享反馈，从同行和领导者中学到，并讨论目标和合适的战略。 </p><p> During a Q&amp;A session with employees at that summit, tensions rose as employees started questioning Beth Galetti, Amazon’s head of human resources and a member of Bezos’s S-team. According to three people who were present at the event, some employees were concerned about what they saw as a lack of resources for diversity and inclusion work, and they wanted to know why Amazon has for years failed to hit certain S-team goals related to the percentage of job applicants from underrepresented racial backgrounds who get an in-person interview.</p><p>在Q＆amp期间;在那个峰会上的员工的会议，紧张局势上升为员工开始质疑Beth Galetti，亚马逊的人力资源负责人和Bezos的S-Team成员。根据这次活动的三个人，一些员工对他们所看到的缺乏多样性和包容性的资源感到关切，他们想知道为什么亚马逊多年未能达到某些与之相关的S-Team目标。获得受访者面试的代表性种族背景的求职者的百分比。</p><p> The conversation reached a boiling point when Galetti was asked why D&amp;I employees at Amazon who work outside of the HR department don’t have access to more granular data about the demographics of the workforce across different management levels.</p><p> 当询问Galetti为什么D＆amp时，谈话达到了沸点;我在人力资源部门外面工作的亚马逊的员工都无法获得更多关于劳动力的人口统计数据的更多细粒度数据。</p><p> At the  @SeattleChamber  #RLC2017 where Beth Galetti, Amazon’s SVP for HR, talks about our leadership principles and our investment in talent.  pic.twitter.com/2AZKIhVy3H</p><p> 在@seattlechamber＃rlc2017，亚马逊的人力资源的Beth Galetti，谈论我们的领导原则和我们对人才的投资。 pic.twitter.com/2azkihvy3h.</p><p>— Jared Axelrod (@JaredAxelrod)  October 20, 2017</p><p> -  Jared Axelrod（@Jaredaxelrod）2017年10月20日</p><p> “You don’t need the data to do your job,” was Galetti’s approximate response, the three sources said.</p><p> “你不需要数据来完成你的工作，”三个消息人士称，格莱蒂的近似响应是。</p><p> “That left everyone in the room aghast,” Kelly-Rae told Recode. “If the data doesn’t matter, then that body of work doesn’t matter.”</p><p> “让每个人都留在房间里，”Kelly-Rae告诉Recode。 “如果数据没关系，那么工作机构无关紧要。”</p><p> Those in attendance said the response was shocking not only because  Amazon leaders boast about the central role data plays in everything the tech giant does, but also because data analysis is crucial in identifying problems and opportunities in diversity and inclusion work.</p><p> 那些出席的人表示，不仅因为亚马逊领导人吹嘘了科技巨头的一切中的亚马逊领导者，而且因为数据分析在确定多样性和包容性工作中的问题和机遇方面至关重要。 </p><p> “That’s the antithesis of what you would say about anything at Amazon,” a current Amazon diversity manager told Recode.</p><p>“这就是对你在亚马逊的任何东西所说的对立面的对立面，”目前的亚马逊多样性经理告诉Recode。</p><p> The Amazon spokesperson said employees at the summit misunderstood Galetti’s intent and that she meant it wasn’t necessary to access the requested data to know Amazon needs to make progress in D&amp;I, or to prove to company leaders that more needs to be done.</p><p> 亚马逊发言人表示峰会上的员工被误解的加莱蒂的意图，她的意思是没有必要访问所要求的数据以了解亚马逊的进步，或者向公司领导者提供更多需要做的。</p><p> After Galetti’s comment, Kelly-Rae raised her hand to explain to Galetti the importance of such data. She then approached Galetti afterward to introduce herself, and to offer to continue the conversation at a later date.</p><p> 在格莱蒂的评论之后，Kelly-Rae举手向加利提解释了这些数据的重要性。然后她后来接近加尔蒂以介绍自己，并在以后继续谈话。</p><p> “She told me when I was at Amazon longer, then I could talk to her,” Kelly-Rae told Recode. “And she walked away from me.”</p><p> “当我在亚马逊的时间里，她告诉我，然后我可以和她谈谈，”Kelly-Rae告诉Recode。 “她走了远离我。”</p><p> Kelly-Rae left Amazon in September after just 10 months; she is now focused exclusively on a consulting business she founded 20 years ago, Chanin Kelly-Rae Consulting. She says the comments by Galetti, who is white, were one of the earliest signs in her brief tenure at Amazon that led her to believe the executive team was not truly interested in making it a priority to attract and retain employees from underrepresented backgrounds.</p><p> 凯利雷在仅10个月后留下了亚马逊;她现在专注于她20年前成立的咨询业务，Chanin Kelly Rae Consulting。她说，白人是白人的意见，是她在亚马逊的简短任期内最早的标志之一，让她相信执行团队并没有真正感兴趣地让它成为吸引和保留来自不足的背景的员工。</p><p>   On the surface, Amazon’s diversity statistics look better than most tech giants: In 2019, 26.5 percent of employees identified as Black. But the main reason for that is the disproportionate number of Black workers employed in Amazon’s lower-paying front-line workforce — the hundreds of thousands of workers who pick, pack, and ship orders out of Amazon warehouses and, in some cases, deliver them to customer doors. (Amazon hasn’t publicly released data on the racial breakdown between its corporate and front-line workforces since 2016.)</p><p>   在地面，亚马逊的多样性统计数据看起来比大多数科技巨头更好：2019年，26.5％的员工被确定为黑色。但这是亚马逊低薪前线劳动力的黑人工人的主要原因 - 数十万工人挑选，包装和乘坐亚马逊仓库的订单，在某些情况下，提供到顾客的门。 （亚马逊自2016年以来，亚马逊没有公开发布关于其公司和前线劳动力之间的种族分解的数据。）</p><p> Around 11 percent of Amazon managers in 2020 were Black, including both corporate staff and front-line warehouse and physical store positions. (Black Americans make up 12 percent of the entire private sector workforce across the US, but just 7 percent of managerial roles,  according to new research from the consulting firm McKinsey.) In 2020, Amazon said it doubled its number of Black directors and vice presidents and would aim to do the same in 2021; Amazon has around 400 vice presidents globally, but only around a dozen are Black.</p><p> 2020年约有11％的亚马逊经理是黑人，包括企业员工和前线仓库和物理商店职位。 （黑人美国人占美国全部私营部门劳动力的12％，但根据咨询公司麦肯锡的新研究，只有7％的管理角色。）在2020年，亚马逊表示，它的黑客董事和副人士翻了一番总统并将旨在在2021年做同样的事;亚马逊在全球范围内拥有大约400个副主席，但只有十几个是黑色的。 </p><p> But even directors and VPs aren’t necessarily at the top of Amazon’s hierarchy, where corporate employees are slotted into Levels 4 through 12, which is occupied solely by Bezos (and soon, presumably,  future CEO Jassy). The top leadership team, the S-team, is composed of about two dozen executives, including everyone at Level 11, and a select few VPs, who sit at Level 10. This exclusive group meets regularly to discuss long-term ideas as well as pressing issues, and to also set or approve goals for important initiatives across the company, including the diversity goals pertaining to directors and VPs. But the S-team hasn’t set a similar goal of doubling Black representation among its own group for 2021.</p><p>但甚至董事和vps也不一定位于亚马逊的层次之上，公司员工在第4到12级，该员工仅由贝佐斯（很快，概念，未来的首席执行官Jassy占用。 S-Team的顶级领导团队由大约二十几个高管组成，包括11级的每个人，以及坐在10级的少数vps组成。这个独家团体定期举行讨论长期想法和迫切问题，并在本公司的重要举措中设定或批准目标，包括与董事和VPS相关的多样性目标。但是，S-Team在2021年，他的团队尚未设定双人组中的黑色代表的类似目标。</p><p> Only this summer did Amazon finally name its first Black leader to the S-team: Alicia Boler Davis, a vice president who runs the company’s warehouse network worldwide. Amazon’s spokesperson said the company has not set a goal to double Black S-team representation in 2021 but declined to provide a reason.</p><p> 只有今年夏天，亚马逊终于将其第一个黑人领导人命名为S-Team：副总裁aliCia Boled Davis，他们在全球范围内运营公司的仓库网络。亚马逊的发言人表示，该公司在2021年尚未设定双黑人队代表的目标，但拒绝提供理由。</p><p>   For Kelly-Rae, this goal to double the company’s Black VPs and directors is not enough. “If Amazon was to ever enjoy wholesale success in diversity and inclusion programming, they need to have experienced D&amp;I practitioners represented at every level,” Kelly-Rae told Recode. “They need someone on the S-team.”</p><p>   对于Kelly-Rae，这一目标是加倍公司的黑色VPS和董事是不够的。 “如果亚马逊在多样性和包容性编程中享有批发成功，他们需要经验丰富的D＆amp;我在每个级别代表的实习者，”Kelly-Rae告诉recode。 “他们在S团队中需要有人。”</p><p> For other Black managers in the division, Galetti’s “you don’t need the data” moment was an inflection point for a different reason.</p><p> 对于该部门的其他黑色管理人员，格莱蒂的“你不需要数据”时刻是不同原因的拐点。</p><p> “That, for me, was transformative,” a current Amazon diversity manager told Recode. “I thought, ‘Shit, if I can’t get buy-in and help from [Galetti], where do I go?’”</p><p> “这对我来说，是转型性的，”目前的亚马逊多样性经理告诉回收。 “我想，'屎，如果我无法从[加尔蒂]的买入和帮助，我去哪儿了？”“</p><p>  All 10 Black employees who spoke to Recode said either they or Black colleagues they know were hired at lower levels in Amazon’s internal hierarchy than their qualifications justify. At Amazon, your level means a lot: It dictates a role’s importance, salary range, and additional compensation (usually in the form of Amazon stock). Coming in at a lower level can set back your career at Amazon by years.</p><p>  所有10名黑名雇员谈到返回的黑人员工表示他们所知道的他们所知道的黑人同事在亚马逊内部等级的较低水平上雇用而不是他们的资格证明。在亚马逊，你的水平意味着很多：它决定了一个角色的重要性，薪水范围和额外的补偿（通常是亚马逊股票的形式）。在较低级别进入距离亚马逊的职业生涯多年。</p><p> “I think there are very serious systemic issues around leveling,” Kelly-Rae said. This observation isn’t merely anecdotal. Kelly-Rae’s former role as a diversity and inclusion manager gave her specific insight into some of  the company’s internal hiring and promotion practices. “It is not uncommon for women, and especially Black women, to have a role advertised at one level but extended an offer at a position that is lower.”</p><p> “我认为整个水平周围有非常严重的系统问题，”凯莉莱说。这种观察不仅仅是轶事。 Kelly-Rae作为多样性和纳入经理的历史作用使她对本公司内部招聘和促进措施的一些洞察力。 “妇女，特别是黑人女性并不罕见，在一个层面上发挥作用，但在一个较低的位置延长了展会。” </p><p>  Sources told Recode that’s what happened with Black employees who joined Amazon in 2016 when it acquired Partpic, an Atlanta-based tech startup founded by two Black entrepreneurs. Multiple former Amazon employees familiar with the situation told Recode that both Partpic founders left after approximately three years because they had negative experiences at Amazon.</p><p>消息来源告诉回收，这就是在2016年加入亚马逊的黑人员工发生的事情，它在被收购的基于亚特兰大的科技创业公司被两名黑色企业家创立的亚特兰大的技术创业公司。熟悉这种情况的多个前亚马逊员工告诉返回两个分开的创始人在大约三年后离开，因为他们在亚马逊的消极经历。</p><p> They said the startup’s co-founder/CEO at one point took a demotion so that she could remove herself from a toxic working relationship with a disrespectful boss. And they said she spent considerable time during her tenure fighting for promotions for several employees who had PhDs but were down-leveled when they joined.</p><p> 他们表示，初创公司的联合创始人/首席执行官曾经采取了降级，以便她可以从与不尊重的老板的有毒工作关系中移除自己。他们表示，她在竞争中花了大量时间，以便为几个有博士学位的员工争取促销，但在他们加入时被下降。</p><p> Sources said Amazon slotted several Black Partpic employees with PhDs into Level 4 roles when they joined the company — the lowest level for any corporate employee, including those who have just finished their undergraduate degree. Another employee, Partpic’s chief technology officer, was placed at Level 5 though some of her peers at Amazon with similar education and work backgrounds were working at Level 6. (She was eventually promoted to Level 6, but it took two years; she later transferred to AWS.) Sources told Recode that the other Partpic co-founder left, in part, because he felt misled and disrespected when Amazon quickly killed the startup’s core technology shortly after it launched as a standalone feature in the Amazon shopping app.</p><p> 消息人士称，当他们加入公司时，亚马逊将几个黑人分开的员工展开了几个黑色的员工，以达到公司的第4级角色 - 任何公司员工的最低水平，包括刚刚完成本科学位的人。另一名员工秘书处的首席技术官虽然她在亚马逊的一些同龄人在6级工作，但在6级工作，她最终晋升到6级，但花了两年;她后来需要两年;她后来转移了两年到AWS。）来源告诉回收另一个秘方的联合创始人留下的，因为他觉得当亚马逊在亚马逊购物应用程序的独立功能开始后很快就杀死了启动核心技术时，他感到误导和不尊重。</p><p>  And for Kelly-Rae, down-leveling wasn’t just something she observed happening to other Black Amazon employees. She said it happened to her. When she received her offer to join Amazon in late 2019, she confronted an unpleasant surprise: Despite her almost 20 years of experience, Amazon slotted her into a management level that was lower than the one a recruiter originally described. That meant a lower salary and fewer shares of Amazon stock.</p><p>  对于凯莉-RAE，下降不仅仅是她观察到其他黑亚马逊员工的东西。她说它发生在她身上。当她在2019年底加入亚马逊时，她面临着不愉快的惊喜：尽管她近20年的经验，亚马逊将她进入一个低于最初招聘人员的管理水平。这意味着亚马逊股的较低薪水和较少的股份。</p><p>   This kind of down-leveling can happen at Amazon, in part, because of the company’s hiring process. Interviews are conducted not only by recruiters and hiring managers, but also by soon-to-be peers of the candidate and at least one person outside of the immediate team, called a “bar raiser.” Amazon told Recode these bar raisers are trained, in part, to identify potential bias during the interview process. A single interviewer taking part in what Amazon calls the hiring “loop” can essentially vote against hiring a candidate, or can recommend that a candidate get down-leveled. Candidates are not told why they are being slotted at a certain level, or one lower than the one they were first told.</p><p>   这种下降可以在亚马逊发生，部分是因为公司的招聘过程。面试不仅由招聘人员和招聘经理进行，而且还通过候选人很快与候选人和至少一个人在直系团队以外的人，称为“酒吧raiser”。亚马逊告诉回收这些酒吧提升者培训，部分地培训，以识别在面试过程中的潜在偏见。一名面试官参加亚马逊呼叫招聘“循环”的人，可以基本上投票反对招聘候选人，或者可以推荐候选人下降。候选人没有被告知为什么他们在一定程度上被开槽，或者比第一次被告知的那个低。</p><p> Anderson, the Amazon spokesperson, would not confirm or deny Kelly-Rae’s specific claim. She acknowledged that it’s common for candidates to be down-leveled during interview processes, but said this is something that happens to employees from all backgrounds, and that candidates are sometimes even up-leveled.</p><p> Anderson是亚马逊发言人，不会确认或否认Kelly-Rae的具体索赔。她承认，在采访过程中候选人潜入候选人普及，但表示这是从所有背景的员工发生的事情，并且候选人有时甚至升级。</p><p> Kelly-Rae said two AWS VPs, including a hiring manager, later acknowledged that she should have been brought on at a higher level, but they hadn’t rectified the mistake by the time she left.</p><p> Kelly-Rae表示，两个AWS VPS（包括招聘经理），后来承认她应该以更高的水平带来，但他们并没有让她离开的时候纠正错误。 </p><p> Amazon judges its version of “culture fit” by evaluating job candidates, and existing employees during performance reviews, on some of the company’s 14 leadership principles. Several former Black employees pointed to these principles as possible tools for discrimination, and said they could provide cover for some managers to use them against Black employees. The most problematic leadership principle according to these former employees is  “Earns Trust,” which reads in full: “Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.”</p><p>亚马逊通过评估求职者以及绩效评估期间的求职者和现有员工来评估其“文化适合”的版本，就其中一些14个领导原则。几位前黑人员工作为可能的歧视工具指出这些原则，并表示他们可以为某些经理提供封面，以将它们与黑人员工一起使用。根据这些前雇员的最有问题的领导原则是“获得信任”，这完全读：“领导者谨慎倾听，坦率地发言，恭敬地对待他人。即使在这样做是尴尬或尴尬的时候，他们也是自我关键的。领导者不相信他们或他们的团队的身体气味香水。他们将自己和他们的团队结合起来最好。“</p><p> “If you talk to people across Amazon, they’ll say that if the company ever wants to weaponize a leadership principle, the one they go to often is Earns Trust,” Kelly-Rae said. “What does it mean? It’s a catchall. It means nothing so it can mean everything. Someone can say it if they don’t think you are a team player. They can say it if they don’t believe you’ll fall in line. They can say it if they believe you’re someone who pushes back too much. And they can say it if you are someone who doesn’t push back enough. They don’t have to quantify it or qualify it.”</p><p> “如果你与亚马逊的人交谈，他们会说，如果公司曾经想要武装领导原则，那么他们往往的人就是赢得信任，”Kelly-Rae说。 “这是什么意思？这是一个渔矿。这意味着它可能意味着一切。如果他们不认为你是团队球员，有人可以说出来。如果他们不相信你会落入一行，他们可以说出来。如果他们相信你是一个推翻太多的人，他们可以说出来。他们可以说，如果你是一个不够推回来的人。他们不必量化它或有资格。“</p><p> Three other former Black Amazon employees interviewed by Recode said the Earns Trust leadership principle was used as reasoning to try to push them, or Black colleagues at the company, out. A Black former Amazon employee told Recode that a director once told them and other Black employees in a candid conversation about the downsides of the company’s values system that “the one they use against Black women specifically was Earns Trust.” After he</p><p> Recode采访的另外三名前黑人亚马逊员工表示，赚取信任领导原则被用作推理，试图推动他们或黑人同事们出局。一位黑人前亚马逊员工告诉回收董事曾经告诉过他们和其他黑人员工在坦率的谈话中关于公司价值观系统的缺陷，这是“他们对黑人女性专门获得信任的人来说。”在他之后</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/2/26/22297554/amazon-race-black-diversity-inclusion">https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/2/26/22297554/amazon-race-black-diversity-inclusion</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/amazon/">#amazon</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/亚马逊/">#亚马逊</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/黑人/">#黑人</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
