Tripp has raised some $15 million in total funding to date.\n  VR startups have largely struggled to earn investor fervor in recent years as major tech platforms have sunsetted their virtual reality efforts one-by-one leaving Facebook and Sony as the sole benefactors of a space that they are  still struggling to monetize at times. While plenty of VR startups are continuing to see engagement, many investors which backed companies in the space five years ago have turned their attention to gaming and computer vision startups with more broad applications.\n Reeves says that the pandemic has helped consumers dial into the importance of mindfulness and mental health awareness, something that has also pushed investors to get bolder in what projects in the space that they\u2019re backing.\n Tripp has apps on both the Oculus and PlayStation VR stores and subscription experiences that can be accessed for a $4.99 per month subscription.\n The company provides a variety of guided experiences, but users can also use the company\u2019s \u201cTripp composer\u201d to build their own visual flows. Beyond customization, one of Tripp\u2019s major sells is giving consumers deeper, quicker meditative experiences, claiming that users can get alleviate stress with sessions as short as 8 minutes inside their headset.

Last year, Fleetwood Mac\u2019s 1977 album \u201cRumours\u201d re-entered the Billboard charts after \u201cDreams,\u201d a song on the record, went viral on TikTok. Dance trends also often go viral on TikTok, which can correlate with a boost in sales for the artist whose song is featured. So, the more music that\u2019s licensed by apps like TikTok and Snapchat, the more opportunity there is for  another Nathan Apodaca moment, which means free publicity for the platform.\n  Already, gen Z artists like Olivia Rodrigo have leveraged these social platforms to promote their new music. On Snap, over 10 million videos were created using her song \u201cDriver\u2019s License,\u201d Snap reports. Rodrigo was also the first artist to use AR Lenses on Snapchat to promote her record-breaking debut \u201cSour,\u201d but to be fair, she also shared AR effects on Instagram.\n Olivia Rodrigo sings about \u201c deja vu\u201d on her new album, and you might also be getting deja vu from Snap\u2019s announcement. TikTok also  struck a deal with UMG in February. And before that, in November, TikTok announced  a new licensing agreement with Sony. Meanwhile, Snap\u2019s portfolio of music partners include Warner Music Group, Sony Music Publishing, and more. These deals aren\u2019t exclusive \u2014 you can make a video with \u201cdeja vu\u201d on Snapchat, TikTok, and Instagram alike. When it comes to deals like these, it\u2019s a constant battle of reactionary one-upmanship.

But the exposed server was accessible from the internet and configured so that anyone from outside the organization could create a user account and log in unimpeded, SpiderSilk\u2019s chief security officer Mossab Hussin told TechCrunch.\n When TechCrunch visited the GitLab server, the login page showed it was accepting new user accounts. It\u2019s not known exactly how long the GitLab server was accessible in this way, but  historic records from Shodan, a search engine for exposed devices and databases, shows the GitLab was first detected on the internet on March 18.\n SpiderSilk shared several screenshots showing that the GitLab server contained secret keys and passwords associated with servers and databases belonging to New York State\u2019s Office of Information Technology Services. Fearing the exposed server could be maliciously accessed or tampered with, the startup asked for help in disclosing the security lapse to the state.\n TechCrunch alerted the New York governor\u2019s office to the exposure a short time after the server was found. Several emails to the governor\u2019s office with details of the exposed GitLab server were opened but were not responded to. The server went offline on Monday afternoon.\n Scot Reif, a spokesperson for New York State\u2019s Office of Information Technology Services, said the server was \u201ca test box set up by a vendor, there is no data whatsoever, and it has already been decommissioned by ITS.\u201d (Reif declared his response \u201con background\u201d and attributable to a state official, which would require both parties agree to the terms in advance, but we are printing the reply as we were not given the opportunity to reject the terms.)\n When asked, Reif would not say who the vendor was or if the passwords on the server were changed. Several projects on the server were marked \u201cprod,\u201d or common shorthand for \u201cproduction,\u201d a term for servers that are actively use. Reif also would not say if the incident was reported to the state\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s office. When reached, a spokesperson for the Attorney General did not comment by press time.\n TechCrunch understands the vendor is Indotronix-Avani, a New York-based company with offices in India, and owned by venture capital firm Nigama Ventures.

Prior to founding Handsome, she spent six years as a vice president at an investment startup that raised and invested over $130 million during her time there.\n Nikki Dominguez is the co-founder and president of  Handsome, an app that provides beauty professionals with equal career opportunities. She also built two beauty academies and one school and turned a team of 70 into a team of more than 150 stylists.\n  Any funding opportunities we had in the pipeline evaporated. This was especially true for investors considering attempts to reach new and underrepresented founders.\n But the fundraising market came back pretty quickly in 2020 \u2014 for some. And though we are thrilled to have closed a $1.5 million pre-seed round in the middle of a pandemic, the challenges we faced in the past continued. The spotlight only turned back on minority founders after the Black Lives Matter movement took off last summer, and we began to pursue fundraising again in late 2020. We could tell by how investors interacted with our pitch deck or asked us questions that they already had preconceived ideas about us and our business.\n We were in our second year of running  Handsome and had traction similar to, if not better than, other male-centric startups that were getting funded, yet we still ran into friction when fundraising. The hard part was that we didn\u2019t have any concrete evidence as to why, or the extent to which, fundraising was harder for minority and female teams outside of our apparent challenges and personal experiences. Men are allowed to have a vision or an idea on the back of a cocktail napkin, while women need to have fully established businesses and revenue streams.\n  DocSend, a tool that we and thousands of other startups use to send out pitch decks to investors, analyzed how investors interact with pitch decks. A recent DocSend  study confirmed our hunch, finding that investors do indeed scrutinize the decks of businesses founded by women and minorities differently.\n For instance, their data showed investors spent 20% longer on the business model section of decks from all-female teams at the pre-seed stage than all-male teams. While more time spent on a particular section of a deck may seem to indicate more interest, it can actually be a sign of greater scrutiny and skepticism.\n  When you look at the makeup of the average VC you are pitching to, it is likely a middle-aged white man. When pitching Handsome \u2014 something that\u2019s reimagining the education and community of the beauty industry \u2014 you can imagine that most VCs don\u2019t understand the value and opportunity at hand. Although beauty is a $190 billion global industry ($60 billion alone in the U.S.), investors who don\u2019t follow this industry might have a hard time understanding how big it is, how the industry works, and how our business fits into this thriving market. Even further, investors might completely discredit our business because of the \u201cbeauty\u201d label.\n All these factors can lead to more time spent analyzing the business model \u2014 and its viability \u2014 articulated in our pitch deck. In reality, VCs are busy, and if they\u2019re spending more time on the fundamentals of your business, they don\u2019t understand it. It\u2019s more likely they are looking for ways that your business won\u2019t work. And, frankly, we are not business school graduates or Stanford alumni, so investors who want to de-risk their portfolios will spend more time looking at our deck to gauge if we know how to build a business.\n  Despite all this, we believe that most of the time, investors don\u2019t even know they are acting on these biases. They don\u2019t realize they may have already written you off, which is part of the problem. Awareness of a subconscious bias is the first step toward making positive change. Investors may think they\u2019re widening the funnel simply by taking a meeting or providing mentorship over coffee when, subconsciously, they\u2019ve already counted you out.\n Even though the barriers are being lowered, minority founders just starting out still have a hard time getting their foot in the door. Most underrepresented founders don\u2019t have an established network, making it difficult to get even an initial introduction. That\u2019s why these founders aren\u2019t getting meetings. So even with more investor goodwill, founders are still unable to access the capital they need to grow their businesses.\n It takes time and effort to enact meaningful changes.

while\u00a0 BIOSConnect\u00a0provides remote firmware update and OS recovery features.\n The chain of flaws discovered by Eclypsium researchers comes with a CVSS base score of 8.3/10 and enables privileged remote attackers\u00a0to impersonate Dell.com and take control of the target device&#39;s boot process to break OS-level security controls.\n &#34;Such an attack would enable adversaries to control the device&#39;s boot process and subvert the operating system and higher-layer security controls,&#34; Eclypsium researchers explain in a\u00a0report shared in advance with BleepingComputer.\n &#34;The issue affects 129 Dell models of consumer and\u00a0business laptops, desktops, and tablets, including devices\u00a0protected by Secure Boot and Dell Secured-core PCs,&#34; with roughly 30 million individual devices exposed to attacks.\n  The reasearchers identified one issue leading to an insecure TLS connection from BIOS to Dell (tracked as\u00a0CVE-2021-21571) and three overflow vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-21572, CVE-2021-21573, and CVE-2021-21574).\n Two of\u00a0the overflow security flaws &#34;affect the OS recovery process,\u00a0while the other affects the firmware update process,&#34; Eclypsium says. &#34;All three vulnerabilities are independent, and each\u00a0one could lead to arbitrary code execution in BIOS.&#34;\n Additional info on the vulnerabilities can be found in  Eclypsium&#39;s report\u00a0and the complete list of affected device models in\u00a0 Dell&#39;s advisory.\n  According to Eclypsium, users will have to update the system BIOS/UEFI for all affected systems. The researchers also recommend\u00a0using an alternate method other than the SupportAssist&#39;s BIOSConnect feature to apply BIOS updates on their devices.\n Dell is providing BIOS/UEFI updates for impacted systems and updates to affected executables on Dell.com.\n CVE-2021-21573 and CVE-2021-21574 don&#39;t require require additional customer action as they were addressed server side on May 28, 2021. However, the CVE-2021-21571 and\u00a0CVE-2021-21572 vulnerabilities require Dell Client BIOS updates to be fully addressed.\n Users who cannot immediately update their systems can disable BIOSConnect from the BIOS setup page or using the\u00a0 Dell Command | Configure (DCC)&#39;s Remote System Management tool.\n &#34;The specific vulnerabilities covered here allow an attacker to remotely exploit the UEFI firmware of a host and gain control over the most privileged code on the device,&#34; the researchers concluded.\n &#34;This combination of remote exploitability and high privileges will likely make remote update functionality an alluring target for attackers in the future, and organizations should make sure to monitor and update their devices accordingly.&#34;\n  This is not the first time owners of Dell computers have been exposed to attacks by security vulnerabilities found in the SupportAssist software.\n Two years ago, in May 2019, the company patched another high-severity\u00a0 SupportAssist remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability\u00a0caused by an improper origin validation weakness and reported by security researcher Bill Demirkapi in 2018.\n This RCE allowed unauthenticated attackers on the same Network Access layer with targeted systems to remotely execute arbitrary executables on unpatched devices.\n Security researcher Tom Forbes found a similar RCE flaw\u00a0 in the Dell System Detect software\u00a0in 2015, allowing attackers to trigger the buggy program to download and execute arbitrary files without user interaction.\n SupportAssist was again patched one year later, in February 2020, to address a security flaw due to a DLL search-order hijacking bug that enabled local attackers to\u00a0 execute arbitrary code with Administrator privileges\u00a0on vulnerable devices.\n Last but not least, last month Dell addressed a flaw making it possible to\u00a0 escalate privileges from non-admin users to kernel privileges, a bug found in the DBUtil driver that ships with tens of millions of Dell devices.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 02:02:21", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6f0f\u6d1e,\u9ed1\u5ba2,ios,\u4ee3\u7801,\u6234\u5c14", "title": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5728\u6234\u5c14SupportAssist\u7684\u751f\u7269\u8fde\u63a5\u529f\u80fd\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u8ba9\u9ed1\u5ba2\u8fdc\u7a0b\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd129\u6234\u5c14\u578b\u53f7 ", "title_en": "Researchers discover four major vulnerabilities in Dell SupportAssist's BIOSConnect feature, letting hackers remotely execute code, affecting 129 Dell models", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dell-supportassist-bugs-put-over-30-million-pcs-at-risk/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6f0f\u6d1e", "\u9ed1\u5ba2", "ios", "\u4ee3\u7801", "\u6234\u5c14"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1068068, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5f53C\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570ARGC\uff08\u53c2\u6570\u8ba1\u6570\uff09\u548cargv\uff08\u53c2\u6570\u5411\u91cf\uff09\u63a5\u6536\u4efb\u4f55\u547d\u4ee4\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u8be5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u662f\u89e3\u91ca\u8be5\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\n \u6709\u5f88\u591a\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u662fgetoptfunction\uff08\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff0cgetopt\u5c06\u5f15\u7528getopt\u548cgetopt_long\uff09.one\u6269\u5c55\u4e00\u4e9bgetopt\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u60e0\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5b83\u65f6\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8fArgv\u7684argnectents\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u7ec4\u9996\u5148\u51fa\u73b0\u6240\u6709\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u662f\u975e\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\n \u6b64\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u5206\u533a\u6570\u7ec4\u3002\u5e76\u4e14\u6211\u4eec\u60f3\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5206\u533a\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6240\u6709\u9009\u9879\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6240\u6709\u7684\u975e\u6d3b\u52a8\u90fd\u662f\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u3002\n \u53bb\u5e74\u6211\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86Parg\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eargv\uff0c\u5b83\u4e0egetopt\u7c7b\u4f3c\u3002\u5b83\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u51fd\u6570parg_reorder\uff08\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u6267\u884c\u6b64\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u6211\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5 -

It is upto the program to interpret the contents of this array of strings.\n There are many ways to do this, one of the simpler solutions is the  getoptfunction (in the following, getopt will refer to both getopt and getopt_long).One extension some getopt implementations offer, is that they reorder thecontents of  argv as they process it, resulting in an array where all theoptions appear first followed by the nonoptions.\n This reordering partitions the array. And we want a stable partition, so therelative order of all the options, and of all the nonoptions is the same.\n Last year I released  parg, a simple parser for  argv that works similarlyto getopt. It has a separate function,  parg_reorder(), that performs thisreordering. I used a simple algorithm for this \u2013 allocate a temporary arraythe size of  argv, parse the arguments, and fill in the options from the startand nonoptions from the end of the new array. Then copy them back, reversingthe nonoptions to their original order in the process. In hindsight, I couldhave moved the options into their final place in  argv right away.\n This runs in  time, but also requires  additional space. Thespace requirement could be a problem (for instance on embedded systems), solet\u2019s see if we can do better.\n The code examples in the following are pseudo-code, and glance over somedetails. Please see the  examples on GitHub for working C++ code.\n We note that if we already partitioned the two halves of an array,, we can compute the partition of both by swapping and . Swapping adjacent blocks in an array is sometimescalled  rotating, and can be done in linear time, for instance using reversal(observing that ).\n  So we can use  divide and conquer. With a recursive function thatsplits the array at the middle, this runs in  time and requires stack space.\n stable_partition_recursive ( first ,  n ,  pred ) {\t if  ( n  ==  1 )  {\t\t return  pred ( first )  ?  first  +  1  :  first ;\t }\t left  =  stable_partition_recursive ( first ,  n  /  2 ,  pred );\t middle  =  first  +  n  /  2 ;\t right  =  stable_partition_recursive ( middle ,  n  -  n  /  2 ,  pred );\t rotate ( left ,  middle ,  right );\t return  left  +  ( right  -  middle ); }\n Much better, but ideally we would like to use only constant extra space.To achieve this, we can use the same technique as in bottom-up merge sort. We first process the array in blocks of size 2, thenagain in blocks of size 4 (whose two halves of size 2 are alreadypartitioned), and so on, until we process the entire array as one block.\n stable_partition_bottomup ( first ,  n ,  pred ) {\t for  ( width  =  1 ;  width  &lt;  n ;  width  *=  2 )  {\t\t next  =  first ;\t\t for  ( i  =  0 ;  i  &lt;  n ;  i  +=  2  *  width )  {\t\t\t limit  =  n  -  i  &lt;  2  *  width  ?  n  -  i  :  2  *  width ;\t\t\t if  ( limit  &gt;  width )  {\t\t\t\t middle  =  next  +  width ;\t\t\t\t left  =  std :: find_if_not ( next ,  middle ,  pred );\t\t\t\t next  =  middle  +  width\t\t\t\t right  =  std :: find_if_not ( middle ,  next ,  pred );\t\t\t\t rotate ( left ,  middle ,  right );\t\t\t }\t\t }\t }\t return  left  +  ( right  -  middle ); }\n  In a sense, the price we pay to avoid the recursion is that we do not rememberthe partition points of the two halves, and need to find them again. This meanswe use the predicate  times instead of .\n However, since the two halves are already partitioned, we can use binary searchto find the partition points. This reduces the number of predicate applicationsto  (since ), whichmeans we have the same time complexities as the recursive algorithm, but usingonly constant extra space.\n stable_partition_bsearch ( first ,  n ,  pred ) {\t for  ( width  =  1 ;  width  &lt;  n ;  width  *=  2 )  {\t\t next  =  first ;\t\t for  ( i  =  0 ;  i  &lt;  n ;  i  +=  2  *  width )  {\t\t\t limit  =  n  -  i  &lt;  2  *  width  ?  n  -  i  :  2  *  width ;\t\t\t if  ( limit  &gt;  width )  {\t\t\t\t middle  =  next  +  width ;\t\t\t\t left  =  std :: partition_point ( next ,  middle ,  pred );\t\t\t\t next  =  middle  +  width\t\t\t\t right  =  std :: partition_point ( middle ,  next ,  pred );\t\t\t\t rotate ( left ,  middle ,  right );\t\t\t }\t\t }\t }\t return  left  +  ( right  -  middle ); }\n If the array is almost partitioned, these algorithms still go through everystep. We can do something similar to natural merge sort, and repeatedlylook for the next place where a rotate is needed, stopping if we find none.We must be careful though, if we simply look for  areas and rotate them,we get quadratic time on alternating patterns. Instead we can look for and rotate the middle two, just like above.\n stable_partition_natural ( first ,  last ,  pred ) {\t do  {\t\t next  =  first ;\t\t change  =  false ;\t\t do  {\t\t\t left  =  std :: find_if_not ( next ,  last ,  pred );\t\t\t middle  =  std :: find_if ( left ,  last ,  pred );\t\t\t right  =  std :: find_if_not ( middle ,  last ,  pred );\t\t\t next  =  std :: find_if ( right ,  last ,  pred );\t\t\t if  ( left  !=  middle  &amp;&amp;  middle  !=  right )  {\t\t\t\t rotate ( left ,  middle ,  right );\t\t\t\t change  =  true ;\t\t\t }\t\t }  while  ( next  !=  last );\t }  while  ( change ); }\n At best this runs in , while the worst-case complexity is the same asthe bottom-up version. Since the widths are no longer fixed size, we have toperform a linear search for the partition points, so the number of predicateapplications is back to . Also, we have to use the predicateto find the middle and next starting point, so we may use more predicateapplications than the bottom-up version.\n There is an algorithm that can perform stable partitioning in  usingconstant extra space ( PDF), but it is somewhat more involved,and not practical given the constraints of the specific task.\n Let us return to the problem of reordering arguments. One issue here is that wecannot tell if any given element is an option, an option argument, or anonoption, without parsing the entire array up to that point (i.e. we cannotassume random access).\n This is because any given element could be preceded by an option that uses itas its option argument (looking at the previous element is not enough, sincethat might be an option argument instead of an option). Or there could be a -- somewhere, which means the remaining elements are nonoptions (unless that -- is in fact the option argument of a preceding option).\n This makes the natural algorithm a good fit, since it applies the predicatelinearly from left to right in each loop.\n So how does this all compare to getopt implementations? The two I checkedperform the reordering in each call by scanning over any nonoptions from thecurrent position, and then rotating them to the end of the array. Thiseffectively builds the array of nonoptions at the end, while moving down thepart that has not yet been processed.\n  This requires constant extra space, but takes worst-case  time.While this could theoretically be used in an algorithmic complexity attack,most systems limit the size of the command-line arguments in some way. As anexample of the worst-case behavior, the following line runs  ls with 200,000nonoptions (redirecting the error messages for missing file), and takes about0.3 seconds (Fedora 24 running in a VM):\n  Whereas this line runs  ls with the same number of arguments, but alternatingnonoptions and options (the  -a option enables showing files that start witha period, and has no effect in this case), and takes 11 seconds:", "posttime": "2021-06-25 02:01:51", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6392\u5e8f,reordering", "title": "\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u8bba\u70b9 ", "title_en": "Reordering Arguments", "transed": 1, "url": "http://hardtoc.com/2016/11/07/reordering-arguments.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6392\u5e8f"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d70e17a3efaa795b87d3eaf4d94395a0.jpg", "infoid": 1068067, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\n\u201c\u8a79\u59c6\u65af\u4e54\u65af\u7684\u65b0\u9896\uff0c\u9898\u4e3a\u5c24\u5229\u897f\u65af\u7684\u4e00\u4efd\u526f\u672c\u5df2\u7ecf\u6d3e\u51fa\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\uff0c\u5411\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u53d1\u9001\u5230\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u88ab\u544a\u77e54\u670828\u65e5\u7559\u4e0b\u4e86\u4e0d\u6765\u6885\u5728\u4e0d\u6765\u6885\u5883\u5185\u7684\u5377\uff0c\u4e8e1932\u5e745\u67083\u65e5\u661f\u671f\u4e8c\u5728\u7ebd\u7ea6\u6e2f\u3002\n \u201c\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u5411\u60a8\u4f20\u8f93\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u5e0c\u671b\u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5b98\u65b9\u5ba1\u67e5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u6d77\u5173\u3002\u6b63\u5982\u60a8\u6240\u77e5\u9053\u7684\uff0c\u5c24\u5229\u897f\u65af\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e8c\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\u53d7\u5230\u8d5e\u626c\uff0c\u6279\u8bc4\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e8c\u5341\u4e16\u7eaa\u4e16\u754c\u6587\u5b66\u7684\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u5176\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u6587\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u786e\u4fe1\u5c24\u5229\u897f\u65af\u5e76\u4e0d\u8fdd\u53cd\u5173\u7a0e\u6cd5\u6848\u3002\u5728\u8bf4\u8fd9\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5bf9\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u4e66\u7684\u4e0d\u826f\u6001\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5408\u89e3\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u9274\u4e8e[Dennett\uff0c\u5df2\u5a5a\u7231\u548c\u907f\u5b55\u6848\u4f8b]\u8fd9\u4e00\u6001\u5ea6\uff0c\u9274\u4e8e[\u4e39\u5c3c\u7279\uff0c\u5a5a\u59fb\u7231\u60c5\u548c\u907f\u5b55\u6848\u4f8b]\u7684\u8fd1\u671f\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e0d\u518d\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5236\u88c1\u3002\u201c\n \u51e0\u5929\u540e\uff0c\u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u968f\u673a\u4e4b\u5bb6 - \u5b83\u5df2\u7ecf\u901a\u8fc7\u4e86\u6d77\u5173\u3002\u6124\u6012\uff0c\u6069\u65af\u7279\u4eb2\u81ea\u9001\u5230\u6d77\u5173\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u7684\u5305\u88f9\uff0c\u5e76\u8981\u6c42\u641c\u7d22\u5b83\u3002\u5f53\u68c0\u67e5\u5458\u6253\u5f00\u5b83\u5e76\u627e\u5230\u5c24\u5229\u897f\u65af\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u5600\u5495\u7740\uff0c\u201c\u54e6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u4e0a\u5e1d\u7684\u7f18\u6545\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u6ce8\u610f\u5b83\u3002\u201d\u6069\u65af\u7279\u575a\u6301\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4ed6\u6293\u4f4f\u4e86\u5b83\u3002 5\u67088\u65e5\uff0c\u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u88ab\u6d77\u5173\u6b63\u5f0f\u6263\u62bc\u3002 Lindey\u6566\u4fc3\u6d77\u5173\u5b98\u5458\u5c06\u672c\u4e66\u8f6c\u53d1\u7ed9\u7f8e\u56fd\u5f8b\u5e08\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u7684\u8bc9\u8bbc\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002 1932\u5e745\u670824\u65e5\uff0c\u5c24\u5229\u897f\u65af\u6d3e\u5f80\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5357\u90e8\u7684\u7f8e\u56fd\u53f8\u6cd5\u90e8\u95e8\uff0c\u201c\u6839\u636e\u201d1930\u5e74\u5173\u7a0e\u6cd5\u6848\u201c\u7b2c305A\u6761\u7b2c305A\u6761\u7b2c305A\u6761\u7b2c305A\u6761\u7684\u89c4\u5b9a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u201d\u6ca1\u6536\uff0c\u6ca1\u6536\u548c\u7834\u574f\u4e66\u7c4d\u3002\u201c\u5c24\u5229\u897f\u65af\u7684\u6218\u6597\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f00\u59cb\u3002 ", "note_en": "In the early 1930s, James Joyce\u2019s  Ulysses was the most notorious banned book in the United States. Using a stream-of-consciousness style to describe twenty-four hours in the life of a lower-middle class Dubliner named Leopold Bloom, Joyce\u2019s classic, published in 1922, was brilliant, dense, convoluted, complex, and legally obscene.  Ulysses was the \u201conly volume of literary importance still under a ban\u201d in the country, Morris Ernst declared. He set out to \u201cliberate\u201d it, and the celebrated case, resolved by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in 1934, was not only a landmark in the law of literary censorship but also a turning point in Ernst\u2019s career.\n    Joyce\u2019s novel had a long history of suppression in the United States. Ulysses had been banned even before Joyce finished writing it. In 1918, as he was completing  Ulysses, Joyce sent chapters to the New York\u2013based literary magazine the Little Review, which published them in installments. The Post Office Department confiscated the issues and burned them. Shortly after, the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice had obscenity charges brought against the Review\u2019s editors for having published the chapter in which Bloom masturbates while watching a young woman on the beach. John Quinn, a noted literary lawyer and patron of the arts, defended the editors in court. Despite Quinn\u2019s persuasive argument\u2014Ulysses was so dense and convoluted that no one could possibly understand it, much less be debauched by it, he argued\u2014a three-judge panel, using the Hicklin test, concluded that the book had the potential to corrupt youth and was therefore obscene. After the New York decision, no American publisher was willing to take a chance on  Ulysses. The book was eventually issued in Paris in 1922, under the imprint of the avant-garde bookstore Shakespeare and Company. Joyce gave Sylvia Beach, the bookstore\u2019s proprietor, the world rights to Ulysses.\n The ban on the book notwithstanding, Ulysses found a wide and receptive audience in the United States. Blue paperbound copies were smuggled into the country and sold at fantastic prices, sometimes as much as fifty dollars. Joyce won critical acclaim for Ulysses; articles and treatises were written about it, its style was widely imitated, and the book achieved masterpiece status. Observed critic Harry Hansen in 1933, a generation of Americans coming of age in the 1920s grew up \u201cwith the idea that [Ulysses] is a literary Bible.\u201d\n Because Ulysses could not be legally published in the United States, it could not be copyrighted. Samuel Roth, an infamous publisher of pornography, seized on this opportunity and began to publish bowdlerized installments of Ulysses in his magazine Two Worlds Monthly. Joyce sued Roth over the unconsented use of his name. One hundred sixty-seven of Joyce\u2019s literary friends, including T. S. Eliot, D. H. Lawrence, and Thomas Mann, signed a petition protesting the \u201cappropriation and mutilation\u201d of Joyce\u2019s work. Joyce won an injunction in 1927. Meanwhile, US Customs officials seized copies of the book that were imported from Paris. In 1928, the US Customs Court, in an action titled A. Heymoolen v. United States, affirmed the exclusion of Ulysses as an obscene book.\n  Joyce, who was living in Paris, launched a search for a reputable American publisher. Aging, syphilitic, and nearly blind, he was desperate for money, and it was rumored that Roth was going to sell another pirated edition, publishing as many as twenty thousand copies. A few US publishers, sensitive to the changing cultural climate around sex and the more liberal obscenity rulings in the New York courts, began to discuss the possibility of bringing out an American edition of  Ulysses. But no one was willing to commit to it; with the legal restrictions in place, publishing  Ulysses was a still a risky proposition. Ernst knew about the renewed interest in  Ulysses, and in the summer of 1931 he had asked Alexander Lindey to help him find a publisher that might be willing to publish the book and cooperate in a test case to remove the ban. Ernst planned to deploy the same strategy he had used in the Contraception and Married Love cases\u2014he would have a copy of Ulysses imported from France and seized by the Customs Office under the Tariff Act as an obscene book, and then he would challenge the seizure.\n  In August, Lindey had a lengthy conversation with Sylvia Beach\u2019s sister, Holly Beach Denis, about the possibility of an American publisher obtaining the rights and participating in the \u201clegalization of Ulysses.\u201d Denis said that she was \u201ctremendously interested\u201d and that Sylvia Beach would likely cooperate if a suitable publisher could be found. Shortly after, Lindey wrote to Ernst, \u201cI . . . feel very keenly that this would be the grandest obscenity case in the history of law and literature, and I am ready to do anything in the world to get it started. What do you suggest?\u201d\n \u201cTell Mrs. Denis that I want to see her,\u201d Ernst replied. \u201cI am sure I can get a good publisher.\u201d\n Two months later, Ernst lunched with Ben Huebsch, ACLU member and vice president of Viking Press. Viking had published Ernst\u2019s  To The Pure, as well as Joyce\u2019s  Dubliners and  Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. In a letter after the lunch, Ernst told Huebsch he was confident that because of his recent victories in obscenity cases,  Ulysses can \u201cnow be tested (in court) with the real hope of gaining immunity for it.\u201d Ernst assured Huebsch that he had little to lose under his plan. Because customs actions proceeded against the book, rather than its publisher or mailer, no one risked fines or jail sentences. Huebsch didn\u2019t have to spend a dime on publishing  Ulysses until the court approved it\u2014the fight would be waged over an imported copy of the Shakespeare and Company edition. Success in the customs case didn\u2019t mean that it was completely safe to publish  Ulysses, however, Ernst warned. The book could still be seized by the post office, and the publisher could be charged under state obscenity laws. The approval of  Ulysses by a federal tribunal, however, made subsequent actions against the book \u201chighly improbable,\u201d according to Ernst.\n  As an incentive to get Viking to publish Ulysses and sponsor the case, Ernst offered Huebsch his usual deal. His normal fee was a retainer of $1,000. If the case were appealed to the Supreme Court, fees and costs could run as high as $8,000. Ernst proposed a contingency arrangement in which he would be paid a retainer of $500 and an additional $500 for each subsequent appeal. The maximum would be $2,000 if the case went all the way to the Supreme Court. In exchange for the reduced rate, Ernst wanted 4 percent of the book\u2019s royalties.\n Ernst knew he had a good chance of winning the case and that the publicity around the litigation would drive up the book\u2019s sales. Huebsch agreed and approached Sylvia Beach about obtaining the American rights to Ulysses. When she demanded $25,000, Huebsch balked. Huebsch then wrote to Bennett Cerf, the young president of Random House, who had also expressed interest in publishing  Ulysses. Huebsch told Cerf that it was fine for him to try to acquire the rights from Beach. Around the same time, Robert Kastor, a New York stockbroker who was the brother-in-law of Joyce\u2019s son, approached Cerf and asked if Random House was interested in publishing  Ulysses.\n Cerf was thrilled at the possibility of issuing the first legal edition of  Ulysses. It would bring Random House, then a fledgling company (only six years old), into major prominence in the publishing world. Cerf and Ernst met in March 1932, and Ernst offered him the same contingency deal he had presented to Huebsch. Meanwhile, under pressure from Joyce, Sylvia Beach agreed to give Joyce the world rights to  Ulysses. By the end of the month, Random House had worked out a contract with Joyce in which Joyce received $1,500 and the firm obtained the US rights to the book. Ernst would litigate the customs case, and if the book were cleared, Random House would publish it. Under the final agreement with Random House, Ernst would receive 5 percent of the royalties if the book were legalized and published. Cerf \u201chad not the faintest doubt\u201d that Ernst would win the case. Ernst, he was sure, could handle the litigation \u201cbetter than anyone else in the country.\u201d\n  Ernst set the wheels of the \u201cgrandest obscenity case\u201d in motion in 1932 when he instructed Cerf to have a copy of  Ulysses sent from Paris to Random House\u2019s office in New York. Cerf wrote to Joyce\u2019s secretary Paul Leon asking him \u201cto purchase the latest edition of Ulysses.\u201d Knowing the courts\u2019 resistance to hearing expert testimony in obscenity cases, Ernst had come up with the idea of pasting positive reviews of Ulysses into the book itself, which would be introduced as evidence. Cerf advised Leon, \u201cif there has been printed . . . any circular containing opinions of prominent men or critics on this book, paste a copy of the circular into the front of the book. It is important that this circular be actually pasted into the book, as if it is separate we may not be able to use it as evidence when the trial comes up, but if these opinions of respected people are actually pasted in the book, they become, for legal purposes, a part of the book, and can be introduced as evidence.\u201d Leon was told to notify Cerf what ship the book would be coming in on so that Cerf and Lindey could alert authorities. Cerf explained, \u201cIt is necessary that they catch this book or all our efforts in this matter will have been in vain.\u201d\n  The main argument Ernst planned to make in court was by then a familiar one\u2014that the question of whether a work was obscene should be determined by contemporary social standards, and it was \u201cundisputed\u201d that the public accepted  Ulysses. Ernst planned to demonstrate this by showing the accolades the book had won from literary critics, professors, and other \u201cprominent men\u201d whose sentiments reflected public opinion. Ernst instructed Lindey to have Random House send more than five hundred letters to esteemed writers and intellectuals surveying their opinion on  Ulysses. Cerf was also told to put together a massive file containing essays, articles, and positive reviews of  Ulysses, as well as statements from \u201cprominent critics, librarians, authors, physicians, psychologists, welfare workers, and the like,\u201d attesting that  Ulysses had major \u201cliterary, scientific, [and] sociological value.\u201d Random House also sent a circular to one hundred colleges and universities, asking whether Joyce was used in courses. Nine hundred letters were sent to librarians, querying whether  Ulysses was on their shelves or whether they would like to have it in their collections. By the end of May, Random House had received favorable responses from several important literary figures, including George Jean Nathan, Theodore Dreiser, John Dos Passos, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Hundreds of librarians said they wanted to have copies of the book and saw  Ulysses as having major literary importance.\n On April 27, 1932, Leon telegrammed Cerf that he had shipped a copy of  Ulysses on the SS Bremen, scheduled to arrive in New York on May 3. Leon had pasted positive reviews into the book\u2019s cover; he also sent several articles praising  Ulysses that he hoped Ernst could use in his \u201cspeech before either the lower or the higher court.\u201d31 Lindey alerted the collector of customs:\n \u201cA copy of James Joyce\u2019s novel, entitled Ulysses, has been dispatched into this country, addressed to our client. We are informed that the volume left on the Bremen on April 28, and is due at the port of New York on Tuesday, May 3, 1932.\n \u201cWe are transmitting this information to you because we do not wish the book to slip through the Customs without official scrutiny. As you may know, Ulysses during the last two decades has been praised by critics as probably the most important contribution to the world literature of the twentieth century. Entirely apart from its profound literary significance, we are convinced that Ulysses is not violative of the Tariff Act. In saying this we are not unmindful of the adverse attitude of your department with regard to the book in the past. We feel, however, that in view of such recent decisions as [the Dennett, Married Love, and Contraception cases] there is no longer any legal sanction for such attitude.\u201d\n A few days later the book showed up at Random House\u2014it had passed through customs. Furious, Ernst personally marched the package over to the customs office and demanded that it be searched. When the inspector opened it and found  Ulysses, he muttered, \u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake, everybody brings that in. We don\u2019t pay attention to it.\u201d Ernst insisted that he seize it. On May 8, the book was officially seized by customs. Lindey urged customs officials to forward the book to the Offices of the United States Attorneys for proceedings. On May 24, 1932,  Ulysses was sent to the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York for \u201cforfeiture, confiscation, and destruction of the book in accordance with the provisions of Section 305a of the Tariff Act of 1930.\u201d The battle over  Ulysses had begun.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 02:01:35", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5c24\u5229\u897f\u65af,joyce", "title": "\u6f58\u65af\u7684\u5c24\u5229\u897f\u65af\u7981\u6b62 ", "title_en": "The Banning of Joyce's Ulysses", "transed": 1, "url": "https://crimereads.com/banned-books-ulysses-joyce-morris-ernst/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5c24\u5229\u897f\u65af", "joyce"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1068066, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "CL-BERDGE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u666e\u901a\u7684LISP\u5e94\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cf\u8eab\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u4f2a\u9020\u5f00\u53d1\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u5b83\u6839\u636eASINGE\u754c\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u548cOS\u8bbe\u65bd\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u8de8\u8d8a\u5e73\u9762\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a\u8d44\u6e90\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u56fe\u5f62\uff0c\u97f3\u9891\uff0c\u7269\u7406\uff0cGUI\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u6700\u7ec8\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u3002\n CL-BOVEGE\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u5b83\u5206\u4e3a\u51e0\u4e2a\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u7531\u5730\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u60a8\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u9700\u6c42\u6216You an\u81ea\u5df1\u5199\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff01\n      ;;\u5c06CL-BOLDGE\u5206\u53d1\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230QuickLISP\u4e2d\uff08QL-DEST\uff1a\u5b89\u88c5-dist\uff06\uff0334; http\uff1a//bodge.borodust.org/dist/org.borodust.bodge.txt&#34;\uff1a\u66ff\u6362t\uff1a\u63d0\u793anil\uff09;;\u52a0\u8f7dCL-BOVGE\u6f14\u793a\uff08QL\uff1aQuickLoad\uff1aBodge-Demo\uff09;\u542f\u52a8\u6f14\u793a\uff08bodge-demo\uff1a\u8fd0\u884c\uff09\n        Cl-Bodge\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u5355\u4eba\u9879\u76ee\u5230\u76ee\u524d\u4e3a\u6b62 - \u4e8b\u60c5\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u7834\u88c2\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u786e\u5b9e\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u6216findme\u548c\u4ee4\u4eba\u656c\u754f\u7684#lispgames\u793e\u533a\u5728#lispgames\u9891\u9053\u804a\u5929\uff0c\u5728IRC\uff1a//libera.chat\uff1a6697\u4e2d\u804a\u5929\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u7531\u8054\u7cfb\u6211\u3002\n  \u00a92021\u7f51\u7ad9\u5185\u5bb9\u5728CC By-Nd 4.0\u00a9\uff06\uff0334;\u9ed1\u8272\u767d\u8272\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\uff06\uff0334; Alfredo\uff0cCC\u7684Iconset by 3.0 ", "note_en": "cl-bodge is a cross-platform Common Lisp application framework tailored forgame development needs.

", "note_en": "Little Red Dog Games is an indie game developer that primarily uses  Godot to create games such as   Deep Sixed,   Precipice, and their latest game,   Rogue State Revolution. To learn more about their experience developing games in Linux, we sat down for an interview with CEO Ryan Hewer and Lead Programmer, Denis Comtesse.\n Tell us a little about Little Red Dog Games. How did you come into being as a company?\n Ryan: We\u2019ve been around for the better part of a decade now\u2014I\u2019d say maybe 8 years. We\u2019re based out of northern New York, and Denis resides in Germany. We started off as a hobby business making point-and-click adventure games and playing around with various tools that are out there. With every product we said, alright, well what if we take it a little bit further? What if we push ourselves a little bit more? Then we started taking on increasingly ambitious games.\n Now we\u2019ve come to the point where we\u2019re not really a hobby business anymore, we\u2019re all full-time developers. We\u2019ve got a studio that has put out four commercial games\u2014and a smattering of other things we won\u2019t admit to. I think we\u2019re one of the larger companies out there that uses the Godot open source software, and we\u2019re definitely one of the larger Linux-focused companies out there.\n   Ryan: Denis is our lead programmer, and he works within the Linux environment, so it\u2019s kind of a requirement for anything that we do. We have to play nicely with Linux.\n Denis: It\u2019s all my fault. Originally the first game was made with Adventure Game Studio, which I believe was still Windows-based, but from 2016 onward we started to use Godot. Since I\u2019ve been a Linux user since about 2008, I just used the tools that I\u2019d always used, and we just went with it.\n  Linux, and by extension Godot, are not usually the go-to game development platforms. Why did you choose to design your games in this software?\n Ryan: We\u2019re not exclusively Linux developers, and working within the Godot system doesn\u2019t come at the expense of other platforms. So for us, because we use Godot for a lot of our products, adapting from Windows to Linux is quite literally like flipping a switch, changing a few parameters here and there; but I would say it\u2019s less than a half-hour\u2019s work to be able to support Linux consumers out there. Linux users represent about 7 percent of our market right now as game developers, which is more than enough to justify the minimal steps needed to be able to make the game compatible for Linux PCs.\n Denis: For my case, I\u2019ve always been using Linux. It\u2019s just my favorite operating system. I\u2019m doing all my work in it. I\u2019m also a musician and I\u2019m recording all my music in Linux, and so for me it was just obvious since most game engines support Linux.\n On the other hand, I didn\u2019t pick Godot because it has good Linux support\u2014that\u2019s a welcome bonus\u2014but because I really like the workflow of it. I tested a couple of engines, and this was the one I preferred. And since I had already worked with Godot, it was obvious that we would continue using this engine for similar projects.\n    What do you find are the benefits of Linux game development over more traditional avenues? Why is it your preference?\n Denis: I usually encourage everyone to use the tools they like. Of course in a game development team we have to agree on certain things like which game engine we use. But other than that, some people use Linux, and some people use Windows on our team. Everyone just uses what they like to use within the limitations of the project. We\u2019re not forcing anyone to work in an operating system they don\u2019t like.\n  Denis: Most of the work is translatable unless you need certain tools that aren\u2019t available on Linux. Sometimes you have to use workarounds, but with compatibility layouts like WINE and all the possibilities that allow you to run Windows software on Linux quite easily now, I haven\u2019t run into any problems. As a Linux user for many years, I know how to approach these things. I\u2019ve mostly used open source software even before I switched to Linux, so the switch wasn\u2019t difficult for me.\n  Ryan: Right now there exists very little pressure or incentive pushing game developers, practically speaking, into developing for Linux. It\u2019s more of a spillover benefit of trying to work with new and diverse tools. Godot\u2019s market share is slowly growing within the realm of non-traditional engines. And it\u2019s inevitable that with that, with an increasing number of developers that are adopting Godot as an engine, you\u2019re going to see more Linux games coming out into the market. There\u2019s no reason not to. It would be a huge oversight for any developer to not be putting out packages for that 7 percent demographic, and it\u2019s painless within Godot to do that. I think just for that reason you\u2019re going to see more content.\n We will say that our Linux users are often very grateful for all of our products that come out in the Linux environment, and they can be some of your biggest cheerleaders. I would encourage developers to pay attention to these overlooked markets, just because that kind of publicity can go a very long way.\n Denis: The only thing that any developer has to be aware of is that as soon as you release something for Linux, you have to do support for Linux. For us it\u2019s easy. If the lead programmer is already working in Linux, then it\u2019s no problem. Every build is tested in Linux by default because I\u2019m using it every day, but for other developers it\u2019s definitely something to consider because you need someone who knows Linux and knows how it works to be able to provide support. Godot was very easy to work with in that regard, and I don\u2019t think we had any Linux-specific bug reports, have we?\n Ryan: No. Actually it\u2019s the opposite. Historically when it comes to development we always get issues in Windows, and then the response back is, well we\u2019re not seeing that on the Linux build at all. And that\u2019s nice\u2014unless you\u2019re us, in which case that\u2019s just frustrating and awful. But I would say that usually the Linux builds have fewer stability issues. I would encourage developers to generally use a mix of OSes in their pipeline really early on in development, because you can catch some real weird behavior that way before it\u2019s too late. We\u2019ve definitely caught some issues when it comes to file naming for the Linux environment, for example, and that sometimes things that would be acceptable in Windows are not acceptable in Linux and vice versa.\n   Denis: I game almost exclusively on Linux because it\u2019s getting easier. A couple of years ago, I occasionally had to use  WINE to run Linux games when I had to run Windows games on Linux, which is getting more and more reliable. It works surprisingly well, and now with Steam Play it\u2019s getting even easier. Most of the time the game just runs out of the box. It surprises me, I usually don\u2019t even check to see if a game has Linux support when I buy it, just because even if it doesn\u2019t, I can usually get it to run.\n As for favorite games, I\u2019m not playing enough, to be honest. I play strategy games and adventure games, and the most recent title that had native Linux support that I played was   Beyond a Steel Sky. I like that one.\n  Denis: I rarely play on Windows. Only in the very rare case where a game just won\u2019t run, and that hasn\u2019t happened in a while. Most stores come with their own launchers, and installing a game is just a couple of mouse clicks, so for me it\u2019s not any different.\n  Ryan: Oh, man. The things I could tell you. We\u2019ve started work on what is our largest and most ambitious project ever, and I don\u2019t like saying the word magnum opus because I say it too much, but this really does qualify. This is a big one. Our team has grown rapidly over the past year or so, and we\u2019re going to be experiencing growth for the next year or so after that. The next game will be stunningly gorgeous.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 02:01:07", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6e38\u620f,\u5f00\u53d1,linux,games",

officials that it plans to open the Supercharger network to other automakers by September 2022.\n The news comes amid several rumors of Tesla opening up its extremely valuable electric vehicle fast-charging network.\n  It\u2019s hard to put a number on that value, but there\u2019s no doubt at this point that Tesla\u2019s Supercharger network is the most extensive electric vehicle fast-charging network in the world.\n Instead of relying on third-party charging networks like most other automakers, Tesla developed its own network from the ground up, which was more of a necessity, considering how early Tesla was with electric vehicles.\n A decade after deploying the first Supercharger,\u00a0 Tesla now has over 25,000 Superchargers\u00a0at over 2,700 stations around the world.\n Unlike third-party networks, like Ionity, Electrify America, or ChargePoint, only Tesla vehicles can charge on the Supercharger network.\n However, Tesla has often indicated that it is open to the idea of sharing the Supercharger network with other automakers, but it would be dependent on coming to an agreement on sharing the cost.\n The automaker has been rumored to be in discussions with other automakers to come to such a deal in the past, but we have never seen any actual results.\n   The rumors of Tesla opening up the Supercharger network have been ramping up lately. A German official recently announced that they have been in  talks with Tesla to open up the network to other automakers.\n  Tesla has been in contact with  Vestland fylkeskommune, the governing body of Vestland county in Norway, about getting access to incentives to deploy charging stations.\n  In minutes of a council meeting obtained by Electrek (hat tip to Hillmann Hunter), government officials confirmed that Tesla told them that it plans to open the Supercharger network to other automakers by September 2022, and therefore, they agree to approve the incentives as long as Tesla goest through with the initiative.\n Here\u2019s the relevant segment of the meeting (translated from Norwegian via Google Translate):\n \u201cThe condition for benefits is that infrastructure must be developed with a publicly available offer. Tesla applied for benefits to expand 5 fast-charging stations. Tesla\u2019s charging stations today are just available for Tesla cars. That type of infrastructure is then only open for use by one group and not for the general public otherwise. In the application, Tesla describes the relevant charging stations will nevertheless be publicly available from the third quarter of 2022. The administration considers that the charging stations for which benefits have been applied for will then be eligible for the scheme, provided that the benefits paid out after Tesla opens the charging offer for all car brands no later than the end of September 2022. The administration recommends that Vestland County Municipality take note that the benefit can be removed if the conditions are not met.\u201d\n For the first time, this put an actual timeline for Tesla opening its Supercharger network to other automakers.\n It\u2019s unclear if it would only be for Norway, Europe, or globally, but as previously mentioned, Tesla has recently been in similar talks in Germany.\n It would be easier for Tesla to open the network in Europe, where its Supercharger network uses the CCS connector, which is standard in the region.\n  In North America, Tesla would have to offer an adapter since it uses a proprietary plug on its vehicles and charging stations in that market.\n  This is a big deal. It\u2019s the best source of information about Tesla opening up the Supercharger network to date, and it also gives us a timeline.\n The timeline should also be reassuring to people since one of the big concerns was that opening up the Supercharger network would result in more traffic and create possibly longer wait times.\n However, with over a year to plan the move, Tesla has some time to prepare and improve capacity where needed in order to welcome more EV owners on the network.\n Obviously, this will be a new source of revenue for Tesla, which it can then pour into expanding the Supercharger network.\n But more importantly, it will enhance the charging experience for every other EV, which will help Tesla\u2019s mission to accelerate EV adoption.\n This move is making some people show their true colors. When I say I&#39;m a Tesla fan, I&#39;m saying I&#39;m a fan of the mission to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles and this is a mission move. More charging solutions for every EV is a good thing for EV adoption period.  https://t.co/sNLoWvVdXg\n  You\u2019re reading Electrek\u2014 experts who break news about  Tesla,  electric vehicles, and  green energy, day after day.

", "note_en": "Most movie companies require viewers to invest 90 minutes or longer to absorb their theatrical works in the way they were intended but this method of presenting a story is reportedly being undermined.\n Earlier this week, the Content Overseas Distribution Association (CODA) informed TF that people are now devoting entire YouTube channels to so-called \u2018fast movies\u2019.\n These are heavily edited copies of mainstream movies that aim to tell the whole story (complete with spoilers) within a very short period, often inside just 10 minutes.\n  As this image of one example channel shows, these edits are very popular and can generate millions of views. According to CODA, there are channels with hundreds of uploads being viewed tens of millions of times, often with a for-profit motive. This means that they may fall outside traditional \u2018 fair use\u2018 style exceptions.\n  During our discussions with CODA our impression was that \u2018fast movie\u2019 uploaders would be dealt with sometime in the future but a few hours ago the anti-piracy group informed us that police in Japan had already sprung into action.\n During Wednesday, the Miyagi Prefectural Police Life Safety Division and the Shiogama Police Station arrested three suspects under suspicion of uploading \u2018fast movies\u2019 to YouTube without the rightsholders\u2019 consent. The arrests were reportedly carried out under the Copyright Act, which was boosted with  new amendments on January 1, 2021.\n \u201cFrom June to July 2020, the suspects edited \u2018I Am a Hero\u2019 and two other motion pictures owned by Toho Co., Ltd. as well as \u2018Cold Fish\u2019 and one other motion picture owned by Nikkatsu Corporation down to about 10 minutes without the permission of the right holders. Further, the suspects added narration and uploaded the videos to YouTube to earn advertising revenue,\u201d CODA explains.\n  \u201cFast movies are clear copyright infringement and serious crime that goes beyond the scope of legally permitted citation, however minor each act may seem,\u201d CODA informs TorrentFreak.\n \u201cFast movies including spoilers would discourage viewers from watching the original films and thus have a serious adverse effect on the right holders.\u201d\n In addition to uploaders who do not seek to gain financially, CODA says that some are effectively commercial operations, working at scale to utilize existing copyrighted movies in order to generate profit.\n \u201cThere are also malicious contributors who make a profit from advertising revenue, such as uploading 270 works and channels that are played about 80 million times in total. In addition, the content including spoilers leads to not watching the official main movie, and the influence on the right holder is enormous.\u201d\n An earlier report from  NHK indicates that the losses cited by rightsholders are huge \u2013 95 billion yen (US$ 856.7m) in the past 12 months alone, roughly $10 per \u2018fast movie\u2019 view when working in the 80 million views cited by CODA.\n  Copyright laws in the United States (where YouTube is based) differ from those in Japan, so it is not yet clear what type of action will be taken overseas. According to CODA, however, the rightsholders it represents are \u201cseriously concerned\u201d with the rise of \u2018fast movies\u2019 and although specifics cannot be provided at the moment, CODA will play a prominent role in any action taken.\n \u201cCODA shall co-operate with international enforcement partners to identify malicious account operators and consult with the police for successful criminal prosecution to wipe out \u2018fast movies\u2019,\u201d the anti-piracy group says.\n In respect of civil action, CODA says it is yet to apply for DMCA subpoenas in US courts to identify people uploading \u2018fast movies\u2019 to YouTube but it will be assisting rightsholders when that takes place, or when lawsuits are filed.\n  CODA informs TF that some channels have already begun removing their \u2018fast movies\u2019. Indeed, CODA sent us a number of links to channels that were accused of infringing the rights of MPA members studios (including Disney) but just a few hours later, these channels had disappeared from YouTube ( 1, 2).\n All of the channels shared by CODA appear to be operated from Japan but there is no shortage of YouTube channels operated from the US too.\n CODA doesn\u2019t name any of these as specific problems but they are undoubtedly popular with movie fans. Well put together, with commentary describing the films in some detail, some appear to have been in operation for years while also managing to evade YouTube\u2019s Content ID system.\n It will remain to be seen what legal remedies the studios have available to them outside Japan but in the meantime, CODA is encouraging movie fans not to visit \u2018fast movie\u2019 channels at all.\n \u201cCODA urges viewers to remember that viewing illicit videos would benefit the criminals indirectly and damage the interests of the right holders who create the original works,\u201d the anti-piracy group concludes.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 02:00:07", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "youtube,\u7535\u5f71,\u53d1\u5e03,\u8b66\u65b9,arrest", "title": "\u8b66\u65b9\u902e\u6355\u4e86\u4e09\u6b21\u5728YouTube\u4e0a\u53d1\u5e0310\u5206\u949f\u7535\u5f71\u6458\u8981 ", "title_en": "Police Arrest Three for Posting 10 Minute Movie Summaries on YouTube", "transed": 1, "url": "https://torrentfreak.com/police-arrest-three-for-posting-10-minute-movie-summaries-on-youtube-210623/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["youtube", "\u7535\u5f71", "\u53d1\u5e03", "\u8b66\u65b9", "arrest"]}]
