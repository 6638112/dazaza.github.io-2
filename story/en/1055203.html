The plane was dark and quiet. A man I assumed to be her husband murmured almost inaudibly in response, something to the effect of “I wish I was dead.”</p><p>这些话来自一名坐在我身后的年长夜晚飞往华盛顿，D.C的年长的妇女。飞机很黑暗。一个男人我认为是她的丈夫几乎听不到反应地嘀咕着，“我希望我已经死了”。</p><p>  To hear more feature stories,  see our full list or  get the Audm iPhone app.</p><p>  要听取更多功能故事，请参阅我们的完整列表或获取Audm iPhone应用程序。</p><p> I didn’t mean to eavesdrop, but couldn’t help it. I listened with morbid fascination, forming an image of the man in my head as they talked. I imagined someone who had worked hard all his life in relative obscurity, someone with unfulfilled dreams—perhaps of the degree he never attained, the career he never pursued, the company he never started.</p><p> 我不是故意窃听，但无法帮助它。我听着病态的迷恋，在他们谈话时形成了我脑子里的男人的形象。我想象一个在相对默默无闻中努力工作的人，有一个没有达到的梦想的人 - 也许是他从未达到过的程度，他从未追求的职业生涯，他从未开始的公司。</p><p> At the end of the flight, as the lights switched on, I finally got a look at the desolate man. I was shocked. I recognized him—he was, and still is, world-famous. Then in his mid‑80s, he was beloved as a hero for his courage, patriotism, and accomplishments many decades ago.</p><p> 在飞行结束时，随着灯的开启，我终于看了凄凉的人。我感到震惊。我认识到他 - 他仍然是世界着名的。然后在他80年代中期，他被允许是他的勇气，爱国主义和几十年前成就的英雄。</p><p>  As he walked up the aisle of the plane behind me, other passengers greeted him with veneration. Standing at the door of the cockpit, the pilot stopped him and said, “Sir, I have admired you since I was a little boy.” The older man—apparently wishing for death just a few minutes earlier—beamed with pride at the recognition of his past glories.</p><p>  当他走上了我身后的飞机的过道时，其他乘客们用崇拜迎接他。站在驾驶舱的门口，飞行员阻止了他说：“先生，我自从我是一个小男孩以来钦佩你。”在认识到他过去的辉煌时，老人明显希望几分钟欣赏了几分钟。</p><p> For selfish reasons, I couldn’t get the cognitive dissonance of that scene out of my mind. It was the summer of 2015, shortly after my 51st birthday. I was not world-famous like the man on the plane, but my professional life was going very well. I was the president of a flourishing Washington think tank, the American Enterprise Institute. I had written some best-selling books. People came to my speeches. My columns were published in  The New York Times.</p><p> 为了自私的原因，我无法让这个场景的认知不应忘记。这是2015年夏天，我的51岁生日不久。我不是像飞机上的男人一样着名的世界，但我的职业生活很好。我是美国企业研究所的繁荣华盛顿智库总统。我写了一些畅销书籍。人们来到我的演讲。我的专栏发表在纽约时报。</p><p> But I had started to wonder:  Can I really keep this going? I work like a maniac. But even if I stayed at it 12 hours a day, seven days a week, at some point my career would slow and stop. And when it did, what then? Would I one day be looking back wistfully and wishing  I were dead? Was there anything I could do, starting now, to give myself a shot at avoiding misery—and maybe even achieve happiness—when the music inevitably stops?</p><p> 但我已经开始奇怪：我可以真的保持这种吗？我像疯子一样工作。但即使我每周七天待了12小时，在某些时候，我的职业生涯会缓慢和停止。什么时候，那么呢？我会有一天渴望回头，希望我死了吗？现在有什么可以做的，从现在开始，让自己在避免痛苦 - 甚至可以实现幸福 - 当音乐不可避免地停止？ </p><p>  Though these questions were personal, I decided to approach them as the social scientist I am, treating them as a research project. It felt unnatural—like a surgeon taking out his own appendix. But I plunged ahead, and for the past four years, I have been on a quest to figure out how to turn my eventual professional decline from a matter of dread into an opportunity for progress.</p><p>虽然这些问题是个人的，但我决定将它们作为我所在的社会科学家，将它们视为一个研究项目。它感到不自然的外科医生取出自己的附录。但是我暂在前进，过去四年，我一直在寻求弄清楚如何从恐惧事件到进步的机会来转向我最终的专业衰退。</p><p>  T “happiness studies” has boomed over the past two decades, and a consensus has developed about well-being as we advance through life. In  The Happiness Curve: Why Life Gets Better After 50, Jonathan Rauch, a Brookings Institution scholar and an  Atlantic contributing editor, reviews the strong evidence suggesting that the happiness of most adults declines through their 30s and 40s, then bottoms out in their early 50s. Nothing about this pattern is set in stone, of course. But the data seem eerily consistent with my experience: My 40s and early 50s were not an especially happy period of my life, notwithstanding my professional fortunes.</p><p>  在过去的二十年中，T“幸福研究”已经蓬勃发展，并且在我们通过生活推进时，共识已经发展了幸福。在幸福曲线中：为什么生活在50岁以后生活变得更好，布鲁克斯机构学者和大西洋贡献编辑，审查了强有力的证据表明，大多数成年人的幸福通过30多岁和40多岁下降，然后在50年代初期下来。当然，这个模式没有任何东西设置在石头中。但是，尽管我的专业财富，但我的40多岁和50岁的40多岁并不符合我的生活，这是我的40多岁，并不是一个特别幸福的时期。</p><p>  So what can people expect after that, based on the data? The news is mixed. Almost all studies of happiness over the life span show that, in wealthier countries, most people’s contentment starts to increase again in their 50s, until age 70 or so. That is where things get less predictable, however. After 70, some people stay steady in happiness; others get happier until death. Others—men in particular—see their happiness plummet. Indeed, depression and suicide rates for men increase after age 75.</p><p>  那么，基于数据，人们会有什么期待？这个消息很混合。几乎所有对生命跨度的幸福研究表明，在较富裕的国家，大多数人的内容开始在50年代再次增加，直到70岁左右。然而，这就是事情变得不那么可预测的地方。经过70岁，有些人保持稳定的幸福;其他人在死亡之前更快乐。其他人特别 - 看到他们的幸福暴跌。事实上，75岁以后，男性的抑郁和自杀率增加。</p><p>  This last group would seem to include the hero on the plane. A few researchers have looked at this cohort to understand what drives their unhappiness. It is, in a word, irrelevance. In 2007, a team of academic researchers at UCLA and Princeton analyzed data on more than 1,000 older adults. Their findings, published in the  Journal of Gerontology, showed that senior citizens who rarely or never “felt useful” were nearly three times as likely as those who frequently felt useful to develop a mild disability, and were more than three times as likely to have died during the course of the study.</p><p>  最后一组似乎在飞机上包含英雄。一些研究人员研究了这一伙伴，了解驱动他们的不快乐的原因。它是一个单词，无关紧要。 2007年，UCLA和普林斯顿的学术研究人员分析了超过1,000名老年人的数据。在Gerontology杂志上发表的调查结果表明，作为经常感到适用于发展轻度残疾的人的高级公民很少三倍，并且可能拥有三倍以上的时间在研究过程中死亡。</p><p>  One might think that gifted and accomplished people, such as the man on the plane, would be less susceptible than others to this sense of irrelevance; after all, accomplishment is a well-documented source of happiness. If current accomplishment brings happiness, then shouldn’t the memory of that accomplishment provide some happiness as well?</p><p>  有人可能认为那些有天赋和成就的人，如飞机上的男人，比其他意识的不可挽回的易感性更容易受到影响;毕竟，成就是一个良好的幸福来源。如果目前的成就带来了幸福，那么就不应该记住那种成就也提供了一些幸福吗？</p><p> Maybe not. Though the literature on this question is sparse, giftedness and achievements early in life do not appear to provide an insurance policy against suffering later on. In 1999, Carole Holahan and Charles Holahan, psychologists at the University of Texas,  published an influential paper in  The International Journal of Aging and Human Development that looked at hundreds of older adults who early in life had been identified as highly gifted. The Holahans’ conclusion: “Learning at a younger age of membership in a study of intellectual giftedness was related to … less favorable psychological well-being at age eighty.”</p><p> 也许不会。虽然这个问题的文献却稀疏，但生活早期的天赋和成就似乎并不似乎在以后的痛苦中提供保险政策。 1999年，Carole Holahan和Charles Holahan，德克萨斯大学的心理学家在国际老龄化和人类发展中发表了一种有影响力的论文，这些纸张看着数百名年初生活中的老年人被认为是高度的。 Holahans的结论：“在研究智力天赋的研究中学习年龄较年轻的会员与......八十年纪岁月不太有利的心理健康。”</p><p>  This study may simply be showing that it’s hard to live up to high expectations, and that telling your kid she is a genius is not necessarily good parenting. (The Holahans surmise that the children identified as gifted might have made intellectual ability more central to their self-appraisal, creating “unrealistic expectations for success” and causing them to fail to “take into account the many other life influences on success and recognition.”) However, abundant evidence suggests that the  waning of ability in people of high accomplishment is especially brutal psychologically. Consider professional athletes, many of whom struggle profoundly after their sports career ends. Tragic examples abound, involving depression, addiction, or suicide; unhappiness in retired athletes may even be the norm, at least temporarily. A study published in the  Journal of Applied Sport Psychology in 2003, which charted the life satisfaction of former Olympic athletes, found that they generally struggled with a low sense of personal control when they first stopped competing.</p><p>  这项研究可以简单地表明它很难辜负高期望，并且告诉你的孩子她是天才不一定是养育的。 （Holahans猜测那些被确定为天赋的孩子可能会使智力能力更加核心自我评价，为他们创造“不切实际的期望”并导致他们未能“考虑到成功和认可的许多其他生命影响。 “）然而，丰富的证据表明，高成就人的能力造成了尤为野蛮的心理。考虑职业运动员，其中许多人在体育职业生涯结束后非常争取。悲剧的例子比比皆是，涉及抑郁，成瘾或自杀;退休运动员的不快乐至少可能是常态的准则。 2003年申请运动心理学杂志发表的一项研究，绘制了前奥运会运动员的生活满意度，发现它们一般在首次停止竞争时挣扎着低于个人控制感。 </p><p>  Recently, I asked Dominique Dawes, a former Olympic gold-medal gymnast, how normal life felt after competing and winning at the highest levels. She told me that she is happy, but that the adjustment wasn’t easy—and still isn’t, even though she won her last Olympic medal in 2000. “My Olympic self would ruin my marriage and leave my kids feeling inadequate,” she told me, because it is so demanding and hard-driving. “Living life as if every day is an Olympics only makes those around me miserable.”</p><p>最近，我询问了一位前奥林匹克金奖金体操运动员的多米尼克Dawes，在最高水平竞争和获胜后的正常生活感觉如何。她告诉我，她很高兴，但调整并不容易 - 仍然不是，即使她在2000年赢得了她最后的奥运勋章。“我的奥运会毁了我的婚姻，让我的孩子感到不足，”她告诉我，因为它是如此苛刻和艰难的驾驶。 “生活的生活好像每一天都是奥运会，只会让我周围悲惨的人。”</p><p> Why might former elite performers have such a hard time? No academic research has yet proved this, but I strongly suspect that the memory of remarkable ability, if that is the source of one’s self-worth, might, for some, provide an invidious contrast to a later, less remarkable life. “Unhappy is he who depends on success to be happy,” Alex Dias Ribeiro, a former Formula 1 race-car driver,  once wrote. “For such a person, the end of a successful career is the end of the line. His destiny is to die of bitterness or to search for more success in other careers and to go on living from success to success until he falls dead. In this case, there will not be life after success.”</p><p> 为什么前精英表演者可能有这么艰难的时间？没有学术研究已经证明这一点，但我强烈怀疑纪念能力显着，如果这是一个人的自我价值的来源，可能会因为一些人而言，提供一个不太令人瞩目的生活对比。 “不开心的是，他取得了快乐的成功，”一名前一级方程式赛车司机，一旦写道，亚历克斯·迪亚·里尔罗“对于这样一个人来说，成功职业的结束是线的结束。他的命运是死于苦涩或寻求其他职业的成功，并在他死亡之前取得成功的成功。在这种情况下，成功后不会有生命。“</p><p>  Call it the Principle of Psychoprofessional Gravitation: the idea that the agony of professional oblivion is directly related to the height of professional prestige previously achieved, and to one’s emotional attachment to that prestige. Problems related to achieving professional success might appear to be a pretty good species of problem to have; even raising this issue risks seeming precious. But if you reach professional heights and are deeply invested in being high up, you can suffer mightily when you inevitably fall. That’s the man on the plane. Maybe that will be you, too. And, without significant intervention, I suspect it will be me.</p><p>  称之为精神病学着引力的原则：专业遗忘痛苦的想法与先前取得的专业威望的高度直接相关，并对这一声望的情感依恋。与实现专业成功有关的问题可能似乎是一个非常好的问题;即使提高这个问题似乎珍贵的风险。但是，如果您达到专业的身高，并且深入投入高涨，当您不可避免地跌倒时，您就可以遭受遭受。那是飞机上的男人。也许这也是你。而且，没有明显的干预，我怀疑它会是我。</p><p>  The Principle of Psychoprofessional Gravitation can help explain the many cases of people who have done work of world-historical significance yet wind up feeling like failures. Take Charles Darwin, who was just 22 when he set out on his five-year voyage aboard the Beagle in 1831. Returning at 27, he was celebrated throughout Europe for his discoveries in botany and zoology, and for his early theories of evolution. Over the next 30 years, Darwin took enormous pride in sitting atop the celebrity-scientist pecking order, developing his theories and publishing them as books and essays—the most famous being  On the Origin of Species, in 1859.</p><p>  精神切除的引力原则可以帮助解释那些做出世界历史意义的工作的许多案例，但是感觉像失败一样。在1831年，他刚刚开始他的五年航行时，达克斯达尔文22岁。返回27日，他在整个欧洲庆祝了他在植物学和动物学中发现的发现，以及他早期的进化理论。在接下来的30年里，达尔文在坐在名人 - 科学家啄食秩序上享有巨大的自豪，制定他的理论并将其作为书籍和论文发布 - 最着名的物种的起源，于1859年。</p><p>  But as Darwin progressed into his 50s, he stagnated; he hit a wall in his research. At the same time an Austrian monk by the name of Gregor Mendel discovered what Darwin needed to continue his work: the theory of genetic inheritance. Unfortunately, Mendel’s work was published in an obscure academic journal and Darwin never saw it—and in any case, Darwin did not have the mathematical ability to understand it. From then on he made little progress. Depressed in his later years, he wrote to a close friend, “I have not the heart or strength at my age to begin any investigation lasting years, which is the only thing which I enjoy.”</p><p>  但正如达尔文进入他的50岁，他停滞不前;他在研究中击中了一堵墙。同时，奥地利僧人的名义被Gregor Mendel的名字发现了达尔文所需要的继续他的工作：遗传遗传理论。不幸的是，孟德尔的工作在一个模糊的学术期刊上发表，达尔文从未见过它 - 无论如何，达尔文没有有理解的数学能力。从那时起，他取得了很少的进步。在他晚年的几年里沮丧，他写信给一个亲密的朋友，“我的年龄没有心脏或力量开始任何调查持续的年份，这是我唯一喜欢的。”</p><p> Presumably, Darwin would be pleasantly surprised to learn how his fame grew after his death, in 1882. From what he could see when he was old, however, the world had passed him by, and he had become irrelevant. That could have been Darwin on the plane behind me that night.</p><p> 据推测，达尔文会感到惊喜，以了解他的成名在他去世后的成名，1882年。然而，当他老了，然而，当他老了，世界已经过去了，他已经变得无关紧要了。那天晚上，这可能是达尔文在我身后的飞机上。</p><p>  I a younger version of me, because I have had precocious experience with professional decline.</p><p>  我是我年轻的版本，因为我有专业衰退的早熟经验。 </p><p> As a child, I had just one goal: to be the world’s greatest French-horn player. I worked at it slavishly, practicing hours a day, seeking out the best teachers, and playing in any ensemble I could find. I had pictures of famous horn players on my bedroom wall for inspiration. And for a while, I thought my dream might come true. At 19, I left college to take a job playing professionally in a touring chamber-music ensemble. My plan was to keep rising through the classical-music ranks, joining a top symphony orchestra in a few years or maybe even becoming a soloist—the most exalted job a classical musician can hold.</p><p>作为一个孩子，我只有一个目标：成为世界上最伟大的法国角球员。我在它掠过，每天练习时间练习，寻求最好的老师，并在任何能够找到的任何合奏中玩耍。我的卧室墙上有着名的角球员的照片，以获得灵感。一会儿，我以为我的梦想可能会成真。 19岁时，我离开大学在旅游室 - 音乐集团专业上工作。我的计划是通过古典音乐排名继续上升，在几年内加入顶级交响乐团，或者甚至成为一个独奏者 - 最崇高的工作古典音乐家可以持有。</p><p> But then, in my early 20s, a strange thing happened: I started getting worse. To this day, I have no idea why. My technique began to suffer, and I had no explanation for it. Nothing helped. I visited great teachers and practiced more, but I couldn’t get back to where I had been. Pieces that had been easy to play became hard; pieces that had been hard became impossible.</p><p> 但是，在我20多岁的早期，发生了一个奇怪的事情：我开始变得更糟。至今，我不知道为什么。我的技术开始受苦，我对此没有解释。没有任何帮助。我访问了伟大的教师，练习了更多，但我无法回到我去过的地方。易于发挥的碎片变得难以努力;一直很难成为不可能的碎片。</p><p>  Perhaps the worst moment in my young but flailing career came at age 22, when I was performing at Carnegie Hall. While delivering a short speech about the music I was about to play, I stepped forward, lost my footing, and fell off the stage into the audience. On the way home from the concert, I mused darkly that the experience was surely a message from God.</p><p>  也许我年轻的最糟糕的时刻，但鞭打的职业生涯于22岁时，我在卡内基大厅表演。在发表关于我即将发挥的音乐的简短讲话的同时，我走了前进，失去了我的脚，并落下了舞台进入了观众。在从音乐会回家的路上，我黑暗地沉思了这一经验肯定是上帝的消息。</p><p>  But I sputtered along for nine more years. I took a position in the City Orchestra of Barcelona, where I increased my practicing but my playing gradually deteriorated. Eventually I found a job teaching at a small music conservatory in Florida, hoping for a magical turnaround that never materialized. Realizing that maybe I ought to hedge my bets, I went back to college via distance learning, and earned my bachelor’s degree shortly before my 30th birthday. I secretly continued my studies at night, earning a master’s degree in economics a year later. Finally I had to admit defeat: I was never going to turn around my faltering musical career. So at 31 I gave up, abandoning my musical aspirations entirely, to pursue a doctorate in public policy.</p><p>  但我多年来一直在闲置。我在巴塞罗那市乐团上坐了一席之地，在那里我练习练习，但我的演奏逐渐恶化。最终我在佛罗里达州的一个小型音乐学院找到了一份工作教学，希望没有实现的神奇的转变。意识到也许我应该对冲我的赌注，我通过远程学习回到大学，并在30岁生日之前短暂赢得了学士学位。我秘密继续在晚上继续学习，一年后赢得经济学硕士学位。最后，我不得不承认失败：我永远不会转过我摇摇欲坠的音乐职业。所以在31岁时放弃了，完全放弃了我的音乐愿望，在公共政策中追求博士学位。</p><p>  Life goes on, right? Sort of. After finishing my studies, I became a university professor, a job I enjoyed. But I still thought every day about my beloved first vocation. Even now, I regularly dream that I am onstage, and wake to remember that my childhood aspirations are now only phantasms.</p><p>  生命正在继续，对吗？有点。完成学业后，我成为一名大学教授，我很享受。但我仍然以为我心爱的第一个职业的每一天。即使是现在，我也经常梦想我在舞台上，醒来难以记住，我的童年愿望现在只是卑微的魅力。</p><p> I am lucky to have accepted my decline at a young enough age that I could redirect my life into a new line of work. Still, to this day, the sting of that early decline makes these words difficult to write. I vowed to myself that it wouldn’t ever happen again.</p><p> 我很幸运能够接受我在足够大的年龄的下降，我可以将我的生命重定向到一系列新的工作中。仍然，到这一天，早期下降的刺痛使这些话难以写作。我向自己发誓，它不会再发生。</p><p> W  In some professions, early decline is inescapable. No one expects an Olympic athlete to remain competitive until age 60. But in many physically nondemanding occupations, we implicitly reject the inevitability of decline before very old age. Sure, our quads and hamstrings may weaken a little as we age. But as long as we retain our marbles, our quality of work as a writer, lawyer, executive, or entrepreneur should remain high up to the very end, right? Many people think so. I recently met a man a bit older than I am who told me he planned to “push it until the wheels came off.” In effect, he planned to stay at the very top of his game by any means necessary, and then keel over.</p><p> 在一些职业中，早期下降是不可避免的。没有人希望奥运会运动员保持竞争力，直到60岁到60岁。但在许多身体上不合适的职业中，我们隐含地拒绝在非常老之前的衰退的必然性。当然，我们的四肢和腿筋可能会随着年龄的增长而削弱。但只要我们保留我们的大理石，我们的工作质量作为作家，律师，行政或企业家应该保持高达最终，对吧？很多人都这么认为。我最近遇到了一个比我告诉我他计划“推到车轮脱落”的人中有点年长。实际上，他计划通过任何必要的方式留在比赛的顶部，然后龙骨结束。 </p><p>  But the odds are he won’t be able to. The data are shockingly clear that for most people, in most fields, decline starts earlier than almost anyone thinks.</p><p>但他将无法使用赔率。这些数据令人震惊地清楚地说，对于大多数人来说，在大多数领域，下降比几乎任何人都在思考。</p><p>  According to research by Dean Keith Simonton, a professor emeritus of psychology at UC Davis and one of the world’s leading experts on the trajectories of creative careers, success and productivity increase for the first 20 years after the inception of a career, on average. So if you start a career in earnest at 30, expect to do your best work around 50 and go into decline soon after that.</p><p>  据Den Keith Simonton的研究，UC Davis教授和世界领先的专家领导者，在职业生涯成立后的前20年，成功和生产力增加，平均而言，成功和生产力增加。因此，如果您在30岁的认真职业生涯中开始职业生涯，期望尽快完成50左右的工作，并在此之后不久跌幅。</p><p> The specific timing of peak and decline vary somewhat depending on the field. Benjamin Jones, a professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, has spent years studying when people are most likely to make prizewinning scientific discoveries and develop key inventions. His findings can be summarized by this little ditty:</p><p> 峰值的特定时间和下降的定时有所不同，具体取决于场景。 Benjamin Jones是西北大学凯洛格管理学院的战略和创业教授，在何时何时最有可能制作科学发现并制定关键发明。他的发现可以通过这个小小的概括：</p><p> Age is, of course, a fever chill that every physicist must fear. He’s better dead than living still when once he’s past his thirtieth year.</p><p> 当然，年龄是发烧寒意每个物理学家都必须害怕。他比生活更好一旦他过去三十年的一年。</p><p> The author of those gloomy lines? Paul Dirac,  a winner of the 1933 Nobel Prize in Physics.</p><p> 那些阴沉的线条的作者？ Paul Dirac是1933年诺贝尔物理奖的赢家。</p><p> Dirac overstates the point, but only a little. Looking at major inventors and Nobel winners going back more than a century, Jones has found that the most common age for producing a magnum opus is the late 30s. He has shown that the likelihood of a major discovery increases steadily through one’s 20s and 30s and then declines through one’s 40s, 50s, and 60s. Are there outliers? Of course. But the likelihood of producing a major innovation at age 70 is approximately what it was at age 20—almost nonexistent.</p><p> diac夸大了这一点，但只有一点。看着大量的发明家和诺贝尔赢家越来越多的世纪，琼斯发现，制作Magnum Opus的最常见的年龄是30多岁。他表明，主要发现的可能性稳定地通过了20多岁和30岁，然后通过40年代，50岁和60多岁下降。有异常值吗？当然。但是，在70岁时生产重大创新的可能性大致为20岁 - 几乎不存在。</p><p>  Much of literary achievement follows a similar pattern. Simonton has shown that poets peak in their early 40s. Novelists generally take a little longer. When Martin Hill Ortiz, a poet and novelist, collected data on  New York Times fiction best sellers from 1960 to 2015, he found that  authors were likeliest to reach the No. 1 spot in their 40s and 50s. Despite the famous productivity of a few novelists well into old age, Ortiz shows a steep drop-off in the chance of writing a best seller after the age of 70. (Some nonfiction writers—especially historians—peak later, as we shall see in a minute.)</p><p>  大部分的文学成就遵循类似的模式。 Simonton表明诗人在40岁初期峰顶。小说家一般需要一点时间。当诗人和小说家奥蒂斯奥蒂斯（Martin Hill Ortiz），1960年至2015年的纽约时报小说畅销书收集的数据，他发现作者最愿意达到40多岁和50年代的第1位。尽管有一些小说家的着名生产力很大，但Ortiz在70岁之后写一个最佳卖家的机会显示了一个陡峭的下降。（一些非小说作者 - 特别是历史学家 - 稍后，我们将在一分钟。） </p><p>  Entrepreneurs peak and decline earlier, on average. After earning fame and fortune in their 20s, many tech entrepreneurs are in creative decline by age 30. In 2014, the  Harvard Business Review  reported that founders of enterprises valued at $1 billion or more by venture capitalists tend to cluster in the 20-to-34 age range. Subsequent research has found that the clustering might be slightly later, but all studies in this area have found that the majority of successful start-ups have founders under age 50.</p><p>企业家高峰和衰退平均。在20多岁的成名和财富后，许多科技企业家逐年创造性下滑。2014年，哈佛商业审查报告称，经济资本家价值10亿美元或以上的企业的创始人倾向于在20到 - 34岁范围。随后的研究发现，聚类可能会略微稍后，但这一领域的所有研究都发现大多数成功的初创企业在50岁以下的创始人。</p><p> This research concerns people at the very top of professions that are atypical. But the basic finding appears to apply more broadly. Scholars at Boston College’s Center for Retirement Research studied a wide variety of jobs and found considerable susceptibility to age-related decline in fields ranging from policing to nursing. Other research has found that  the best-performing home-plate umpires in Major League Baseball have 18 years less experience and are 23 years younger than the worst-performing umpires (who are 56.1 years old, on average). Among air traffic controllers, the age-related decline is so sharp—and the potential consequences of decline-related errors so dire—that the mandatory retirement age is 56.</p><p> 这项研究涉及人们的职业最高的人。但基本发现似乎更广泛地申请。波士顿学院退休研究中心的学者研究了各种各样的工作，并发现与宣誓教会的年龄相关的年龄相关的衰退相当大的易感性。其他研究发现，主要联盟棒球的最佳家庭板裁判员有18年的经验，比最糟糕的裁判员更年轻，23岁（平均为56.1岁）。在空中交通管制员中，与年龄相关的下降是如此尖锐 - 拒绝相关错误的潜在后果 - 强制性退休年龄为56。</p><p>  In sum, if your profession requires mental processing speed or significant analytic capabilities—the kind of profession most college graduates occupy—noticeable decline is probably going to set in earlier than you imagine.</p><p>  总而言之，如果您的职业需要精神处理速度或重大分析能力 - 那种大学毕业生占用的职业明显下降可能会比您想象的更早。</p><p>  I  is inevitable but also happens earlier than most of us expect, what should we do when it comes for us?</p><p>  我是不可避免的，但也比我们大多数人在我们来临的时候早点发生，我们应该在我们来的时候怎么办？</p><p> Whole sections of bookstores are dedicated to becoming successful.

Consider the case of Johann Sebastian Bach. Born in 1685 to a long line of prominent musicians in central Germany, Bach quickly distinguished himself as a musical genius. In his 65 years, he published more than 1,000 compositions for all the available instrumentations of his day.</p><p> 但有些人已经管理了他们的下降。考虑Johann Sebastian Bach的案例。 Bach迅速出生于1685年到德国中部的长长的音乐家，迅速将自己视为音乐天才。在65年的年度，他为他一天的所有可用仪器发表了1,000多个组合物。</p><p> Early in his career, Bach was considered an astoundingly gifted organist and improviser. Commissions rolled in; royalty sought him out; young composers emulated his style. He enjoyed real prestige.</p><p> 在他的职业生涯早期，巴赫被认为是一个惊人的有天赋的器官和即兴创作者。佣金滚入;皇室寻找他;年轻的作曲家模仿了他的风格。他喜欢真正的声望。 </p><p> But it didn’t last—in no small part because his career was overtaken by musical trends ushered in by, among others, his own son, Carl Philipp Emanuel, known as C.P.E. to the generations that followed. The fifth of Bach’s 20 children, C.P.E. exhibited the musical gifts his father had. He mastered the baroque idiom, but he was more fascinated with a new “classical” style of music, which was taking Europe by storm. As classical music displaced baroque, C.P.E.’s prestige boomed while his father’s music became passé.</p><p>但它没有持续的是，没有小部分，因为他的职业生涯被举办的音乐趋势所追求，其中包括他自己的儿子，被称为C.p.e的Carl Philipp Emanuel。到后面的几代人。巴赫的20名儿童的第五个，C.P.E.展示了他父亲的音乐礼物。他掌握了巴洛克的成语，但他更加着迷于新的“古典”风格的音乐，这是由风暴带来欧洲的。作为古典音乐流离失所的巴洛克，C.p.e.父亲的音乐变得Passé的兴奋地蓬勃发展。</p><p>  Bach easily could have become embittered, like Darwin. Instead, he chose to redesign his life, moving from innovator to instructor. He spent a good deal of his last 10 years writing  The Art of Fugue, not a famous or popular work in his time, but one intended to teach the techniques of the baroque to his children and students—and, as unlikely as it seemed at the time, to any future generations that might be interested. In his later years, he lived a quieter life as a teacher and a family man.</p><p>  像达尔文一样轻松地浮动。相反，他选择重新设计他的生命，从创新者转向教练。他在过去10年中度过了很多，他的艺术艺术，而不是在他的时代的着名或热门工作，而是一个意图教授巴洛克式的技术对他的孩子和学生 - 而且，因为它似乎不太可能时间，到任何可能有兴趣的后代。在他晚年，他像老师和一个家人一样平静了一个安静的生活。</p><p>  What’s the difference between Bach and Darwin? Both were preternaturally gifted and widely known early in life. Both attained permanent fame posthumously. Where they differed was in their approach to the midlife fade. When Darwin fell behind as an innovator, he became despondent and depressed; his life ended in sad inactivity. When Bach fell behind, he reinvented himself as a master instructor. He died beloved, fulfilled, and—though less famous than he once had been—respected.</p><p>  巴赫和达尔文之间有什么区别？两者都是在生活早期的预知和众所周知。两者都遭到了永久性的名声。他们所不同的是他们对中年褪色的方法。当达尔文落后于创新者时，他变得沮丧和沮丧;他的生命结束了悲伤的不活动。当巴赫落后时，他将自己重新发明了一位主教练。他曾经去过祂心爱的，达成，而且 - 虽然曾经尊重的少数少。</p><p> The lesson for you and me, especially after 50: Be Johann Sebastian Bach, not Charles Darwin.</p><p> 你和我的课程，特别是在50之后：是约翰塞巴斯蒂安巴赫，而不是查尔斯达尔文。</p><p>  A potential answer lies in the work of the British psychologist Raymond Cattell, who in the early 1940s introduced the concepts of fluid and  crystallized intelligence. Cattell defined fluid intelligence as the ability to reason, analyze, and solve novel problems—what we commonly think of as raw intellectual horsepower. Innovators typically have an abundance of fluid intelligence. It is highest relatively early in adulthood and diminishes starting in one’s 30s and 40s.
