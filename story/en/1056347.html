These ports controlled the spread the only way anyone knew how: medical quarantines. Staten Island reluctantly hosted the Port of New York’s infected for much of the first half of the 1800s. There are at least three burial grounds on the island for those who died in medical quarantine hospitals.</p><p>在十九世纪，纽约这样的港口城市等患有毛刺，霍乱，天花，黄热病和“黑呕吐物”的时期是世界病变的捕捞盆地。这些端口控制了唯一的途径，任何人知道如何：医疗隔离。史丹岛勉强举办了18世纪上半叶的大部分地区感染的纽约港。岛上至少有三个埋葬的地面，适合那些在医疗检疫医院死亡的人。</p><p> One burial ground can be found on the corner of St. Marks Place and Hyatt Street in the neighborhood now called St. George, not far from the Staten Island Ferry. The northeast corner of this intersection brackets a municipal plaza of the Richmond County Courthouse. On the overcast day I traveled there in December 2020, the plaza was virtually empty. The number of Covid-19 cases were spiking on Staten Island.</p><p> 一个埋葬地面可以在圣克斯地区和凯悦街的拐角处找到，现在叫做St. George，离Staten Island Ferry不远。这个交叉路口的东北角托架了里士满县法院的市政广场。在我2020年12月在那里旅行的阴天日，广场几乎是空的。 Covid-19案件的数量在史特纳岛上飙升。</p><p> Earlier in the year, I heard a news report that mentioned there were few, if any, memorials to those who died in the influenza pandemic of 1918. It just wasn’t the sort of mass death that  lent itself easily to memorialization. I wondered if or how we would memorialize our own pandemic. Soon thereafter, I stumbled across a  blog post about the burial grounds—and memorials—dedicated to those who died in nineteenth-century pandemics on Staten Island. I wanted to go see all three sites—the one in St. George, one up the road from there, and one farther south along the coast called Seguine Point—thinking maybe I would glimpse into our future. I was also tired of being inside and wanted to get out for a walk.</p><p> 我早些时候在一年中，我听到了一份新闻报道，提到了1918年甲型流感大流行病的人的少数，如果有的话，如果有的话，那么就没有那种借给纪念纪念的大规模死亡。我想知道是否或者我们如何纪念我们自己的大流行。此后，我很快，我偶然发现了一个关于埋葬地面的博客文章 - 和纪念碑 - 致力于那些在史坦岛上的十九世纪疯狂的人去世。我想去看看所有三个地点 - 在圣乔治的一个，一个在那里的路上，一个沿着海岸的一个往返叫做Segine Point的南方思考也许我会瞥见我们的未来。我也厌倦了在里面，想出去散步。</p><p> In the center of the courthouse plaza is a mangy patch of grass, maybe twenty by thirty feet large and rimmed with sidewalks. Near the center is what looks like a gravestone. Underneath a recessed Catholic cross it reads   1845–1851. The marker is off center and quite small relative to the size of the patch of grass. It feels slightly out of place and inadequate; a single gravestone implies a single death, when this clearly isn’t the case. The small marker struggles to encapsulate the wave of death caused by the Irish potato famine that crashed on the shores of Staten Island. Near the gravestone is a much larger sign that reads   1799–1858. These signs appear related, but already the dates raise questions.</p><p> 在法院的中心，广场是一个漫画的草地，也许二十英尺大，带人行道上的边缘。靠近中心是看起来像墓碑的内容。在嵌入的天主教十字架下面，它读了1845-1851。标记偏离中心，相对于草片的大小相当小。它感觉略微不合适，不充分;单个墓碑意味着单一死亡，当这种情况清楚并非如此。小型标记斗争，以封装由坠落在史丹岛海岸的爱尔兰马铃薯饥荒导致的死亡。在墓碑附近是一个更大的标志，读了1799-1858。这些迹象显示相关，但已经提出了问题。</p><p> In the nineteenth century, the area occupied by the courthouse housed the locally infamous Marine Hospital, a medical quarantine. This complex of buildings, built on the site in 1799, treated the contagious masses that came through New York, rich and poor alike. The reigning theory of disease transmission at the time was ghostly and gaseous; medical professionals argued that illness emanated from odors, the humidity of steerage, and the stew of marshes. It was carried by winds and in the sheets of the sick. The only effective cure, according to the latest science, was containment.</p><p> 在十九世纪，法院占据的地区设有局部臭名昭着的海洋医院，医疗检疫。这座建筑物的复合物，建于1799年的网站，对待通过纽约的传染性群众，富裕和穷人。当时疾病传播的统治理论是幽灵般的幽灵般和气态;医疗专业人士认为，疾病从异味散发出来，静止的湿度，以及沼泽的炖菜。它是被风和病床携带的。根据最新科学的唯一有效治愈是遏制。</p><p> Up until the 1840s the complex served only a slow trickle of the sick, about five hundred patients a year. Almost from the beginning, neighbors fearing infection complained, to no avail. The arrangement festered. Then the fire-hose spray of European immigration—spurred in part by the Irish famine—flooded the hospital and the surrounding neighborhood with patients. The pitch of islanders’ consternation grew considerably. By 1849 seven thousand people moved through the Marine Hospital per year. Before undertakers had hauled the dead up the road to the Marine Cemetery, near Silver Lake. But during this wave of immigration, so many people were dying that officials directed workers to cut graves on the Marine Hospital’s grounds to bury the dead. There was not enough room for single graves, so three or more bodies filled each trench. In the three years the mass grave operated, from 1847 to 1850, it’s possible that three thousand bodies were buried in the ground under my feet.</p><p> 直到1840年代，该综合体只能慢慢生病，每年约五百名患者。几乎从一开始，邻居担心感染抱怨，无济于事。安排疲惫不堪。然后由欧洲移民的消防软管喷雾刺激，部分地由爱尔兰饥荒淹没了医院和周围的邻近患者。岛民的音高会变得大大增长。到1849年，七千人每年通过海洋医院。在进行靠近银湖附近的海洋公墓的道路上拖了一下死者。但在这浪潮的移民期间，很多人死于官员指示工人在海洋医院的理由上切割坟墓来埋葬死者。没有足够的坟墓空间，所以三个或更多的尸体填充了每个沟槽。在三年内，群众坟墓经营，从1847年到1850年，它可能在我脚下埋葬了三千个尸体。</p><p>  The Marine Hospital was unsurprisingly deadly for the hospital’s workers. Budget reports list funeral expenses for employees as their own line item. In 1850 the hospital purchased 556 wooden coffins. In 1856, a year with a deadly yellow-fever outbreak at the Marine Hospital, thirty-three workers came down with the virus, including five nurses, four orderlies, and a cook. Contemporary maps of the grounds show a separate graveyard for employees down the hill from the plaza.</p><p>  海洋医院对医院的工人致命致命。预算报告列出员工作为自己的行项目的丧葬费用。 1850年，该医院购买了556个木制棺材。 1856年，在海洋医院的致命黄热病爆发的一年里，三十三名工人随着病毒，包括五名护士，四个秩序和厨师。当代地图的地图显示了一个独立的墓地，供山上乘坐广场下山。 </p><p> I walked downhill on Hyatt Street toward Victory Boulevard, looking for any sign of the employees’ gravesite. In the middle of the block, inexplicably, is a gigantic pit that’s gone to seed, bordered by a chain-link fence. Marshy plants abound. The pit appears to be a municipal quagmire unrelated to the burial sites, but I estimate the cemetery was located in the southeast corner, next to a day care, a check cashing store, and a Domino’s Pizza. There are no historical markers of what was, or still is, here.</p><p>我在凯悦街走向胜利大道，寻找员工墓地的任何迹象。在街区的中间，莫名其妙地是一种巨大的坑，即被种子，由链子连锁围栏接壤。沼泽植物比比皆是。坑似乎是与墓地无关的市政泥潭，但我估计墓地位于东南角，毗邻一日花，支票兑现商店和多米诺的比萨饼。这里没有什么历史标记，或者仍然是在这里。</p><p> The burial site up the hill on St. Marks and Hyatt, with its single gravestone in the courthouse plaza, is the result of an archaeological survey and disinterment that began in 2003. The remains that were recovered were placed in coffins and reburied in a concrete vault under the patchy grass. I am skeptical that everyone buried there was Irish, as the gravestone implies through omission. How could they be? Immigrants from all over the world came to New York in the nineteenth century, not to mention soldiers coming back from the Spanish-American War with yellow fever.</p><p> 在圣克斯和凯悦山上埋葬山丘，在法院广场上的单身墓碑，是2003年开始的考古调查和失去诠释的结果。回收的遗体被置于棺材中并在混凝土中重新恢复在斑驳的草地下的拱顶。我持怀疑态度，每个人都埋在那里有爱尔兰人，因为墓碑通过遗漏意味着。他们怎么样？来自世界各地的移民在十九世纪来到纽约，更不用说从西班牙 - 美国战争的士兵用黄热病。</p><p> Then again, that gravestone doesn’t preclude other ethnicities and other stories buried in the crypt. It just expresses the prerogative of whoever arranged this contemporary memorial. But maybe this is the only way we memorialize something that is almost unmemorializable: a gigantic collection of assorted unidentified bones. These bones become a proxy for the tragedy of the Irish famine but cannot also carry the memory of the five or six diseases that randomly washed over the world in the nineteenth century. It’s why we have infinitely more memorials for 9/11 than for the victims of yellow fever. Memorials rarely pay homage to people—they use people to pay homage to ideas.</p><p> 然后，墓碑并不排除埋藏的其他种族和其他故事。它只是表达了安排这一当代纪念的人的特权。但也许这是我们纪念几乎不大规模化的唯一纪念的唯一方法：繁殖的身份不明骨骼的巨大收藏。这些骨头成为爱尔兰饥荒的悲剧的代理，但也不能携带在十九世纪随机洗涤世界的五种或六种疾病的记忆。这就是为什么我们为9/11拥有无限的纪念碑，而不是黄热病的受害者。纪念碑很少向人们致敬 - 他们使用人们对想法致敬。</p><p>  Once immigration to New York tapered off in the early 1850s, unclaimed bodies from the Marine Hospital were once again taken up the road to the Marine Cemetery. As they were wheeled past Staten Island homes, their inhabitants grew increasingly alarmed by the idea of living in the wake of diseased corpses, spouting their miasmas of germs. These fears would continue until residents found a direct but radical solution that cut out the root of their problem: they burned the Marine Hospital down in 1858.</p><p>  一旦移民到1850年代初，纽约逐渐减少，海洋医院的无人认领的身体再次将通往海洋公墓的道路。因为他们被转过了史泰登岛的家园，他们的居民因生活在患病尸体之后而越来越惊慌失措，从而掠夺他们的细菌米萨斯。这些恐惧将持续到居民发现一种直接但激进的解决方案，这些解决方案减少了他们的问题根源：他们于1858年烧毁了海洋医院。</p><p> The annual number of patients treated at the Marine Hospital complex was down to the low hundreds by 1858, but the villagers had had enough. On the night of September 1 a mob stormed the six-foot walls with mattresses full of straw and flammable camphene. What didn’t burn the first night, they came back and lit the second. A stevedore shot another stevedore to settle a grudge and an ailing patient passed during those two nights, but no one died as a direct result of the blaze. After the compound was reduced to smoldering rubble, it was never rebuilt. The Marine Cemetery at Silver Lake essentially ceased operations, too.</p><p> 在海洋医院综合体处治疗的患者的年度数量下降到1858年的低位，但村民们已经足够了。 9月1日晚上，一个暴徒撞上了六英尺的墙壁，装满了稻草和燃烧的樟树。什么并没有烧第一个晚上，他们回来了，点燃了第二个。斯特韦德射击了另一个斯蒂夫服德来解决怨恨，并在这两晚上通过了一名疾病的患者，但没有人作为大火的直接导致死亡。在将化合物降低到闷烧的瓦砾之后，它永远不会重建。 Silver Lake的海洋公墓也基本上停止了操作。</p><p>  But the burial plot near Silver Lake was still there. Throughout the rest of the 1800s, the Marine Cemetery had a fence and a house for the caretaker. Gravestones marked a handful of the dead: William Crowther of London, who died in 1818 of fever while on his way home from Haiti to Philadelphia, and Andrew Staley, a “native of Old England who fell victim to the epidemic fever” in 1805. A 1923 site survey showed that twenty-four tombstones remained, which I calculate to be less than half of a tenth of one percent of the total number buried. The Marine Cemetery was then swallowed up by the new public Silver Lake Park in the 1920s. When the city then turned a portion of the park into a golf course, the surviving gravestones were buried in the process of terraforming the links.</p><p>  但银湖附近的埋葬地块仍然存在。在19世纪余下，海洋公墓有一个栅栏和看护人的房子。墓碑标志着少数死者：威廉·众多伦敦，他在1818年发烧时去世，同时在从海地到费城，安德鲁斯塔利，1805年的“旧英格兰的古老英格兰的原产人”。 1923年的网站调查显示，二十四个墓碑仍然存在，我计算的时间不到埋地总数的十分之一。然后，在20世纪20年代，新的公共银湖公园吞噬了海洋公墓。当城市然后将公园的一部分转变为高尔夫球场时，潜伏的墓碑被埋葬在地带地下的环节中。</p><p> My self-guided tour took me there next. Layered over the land where all the dead were buried is the eighteenth fairway. Right beyond the golf-cart parking lot and next to a sand trap is a boulder that sits on paving bricks; behind it is a blue spruce and a flagpole with an American flag, an Irish flag, and a Parks Department flag.</p><p> 我的自我引导之旅带我接下来。层叠在整个死者被埋没的土地上是第十八球道。超越高尔夫购物车停车场，毗邻沙坑是一块坐在铺路砖的巨石;在它背后是蓝色云杉和一个旗杆，与美国国旗，爱尔兰国旗和公园部门旗帜。 </p><p>   Here, once again, are conflicting dates and figures, suggesting that the cemetery was only open from 1849 to 1858 and that there are seven thousand dead, a number I haven’t seen elsewhere. While it is wonderful that someone has recognized the thousands of people probably buried beneath the golf course, it notably revolves around a certain strain of Irish identity. One effective way to remember messy, sprawling catastrophes is by sorting out the dead into different buckets. It slices away at the vines and weeds that make human death an unwieldy, largely ungraspable abstraction. To remember, we reduce the story to one that the living can relate to. Clearly someone needed this story, this memorial, to exist, though I can’t say who. It might not matter if the facts aren’t perfectly straight.</p><p>在这里，再一次是冲突的日期和数据，表明墓地从1849年到1858年开放，那里有七千人死亡，我在其他地方没有见过的数字。虽然有人认识到有人认识到可能埋在高尔夫球场下面的人，但它局部围绕着一定的爱尔兰身份留出了一定的身份。记住凌乱，蔓延的灾难的一种有效方法是通过将死者分类成不同的桶。它在葡萄藤和杂草上切开，使人类死亡成为一个笨重的，在很大程度上不可批压的抽象。要记住，我们将故事减少到一个生活可以与之相关的故事。显然有人需要这个故事，这个纪念馆，虽然我不能说谁。如果事实并不完全直接，这可能没关系。</p><p>   After 1858 ships still needed a place to send infected passengers, and people without family or money continued to die on the various islands in New York Bay that still quarantined the sick. Though the state stopped using the Marine Cemetery, they continued to bury bodies elsewhere on Staten Island. Officials sent diseased corpses to a burial ground on a marshy lowland on the southeastern coast now known as Seguine Point.</p><p>   1858年船只仍然需要一个发送受感染的乘客的地方，没有家庭或金钱的人继续死于纽约海湾的各种岛屿，仍然被隔离。虽然国家停止使用海洋公墓，但他们继续在史丹岛的其他地方埋葬尸体。官员将患有尸体送到了沼泽地在东南海岸的沼泽地面上，现在称为SEGE点。</p><p> As a burial ground, Seguine Point was as hotly contested and despised by its neighbors as any other. The plot had been the proposed site of a quarantine hospital to replace the compound farther north in Tompkinsville. The state even started construction on a new building in 1857, but the locals torched the nascent structure. They also destroyed the pier, hoping to further inhibit the use of the site. This spate of destruction inspired the pyromania in Tompkinsville of the next year.</p><p> 作为一个埋葬地，SEGUINE Point与其邻国一样热烈竞争和鄙视。该情节是检疫医院的拟议部门，以取代Tompkinsville的北方的复合。国家甚至在1857年开始在新建筑上建造，但当地人武装了新兴的结构。他们还摧毁了码头，希望进一步抑制现场的使用。这种破坏激烈启发了明年Tompkinsville的Pycomania。</p><p> When a  New York Times journalist traveled to the site in 1882, after it began serving as a burial ground, he could not find a carriage that would take him from the train station to the beach. Locals didn’t dare go near it. The plot was neighbored only by farms. He walked muddy roads until a passing driver agreed to take him as close as half a mile. Upon arrival the reporter found a “desolate” scene. Not much more than cheap wooden tablets marked the graves. A fallen tree lay among the plots. He met a man fishing near the site who told him that he often saw people pull up in tugboats, dump the coffins in graves, cover them with dirt, and leave without a prayer.</p><p> 当纽约时报记者于1882年到达该网站时，在它开始作为埋葬地面之后，他找不到一个将从火车站带到海滩的马车。当地人不敢靠近它。这些情节只有农场邻居。他走了泥泞的道路，直到通过司机同意把他带到半英里。抵达后，记者发现了一个“荒凉的”场景。不得超过廉价的木片标记坟墓。一棵倒下的树在地块中躺着。他遇到了一个在网站附近的男子钓鱼，他们告诉他，他经常看到人们在拖船中拉起，倾倒坟墓中的棺材，用泥土覆盖它们，没有祷告。</p><p> In 1890 the state decided to get rid of the graves at Seguine Point. Officials hired a dredging contractor named Mr. Flannery to exhume the bodies and cremate them on site in an ad hoc brick oven. A series of articles in the  New York Herald captured the careless and grisly process. As hired men dug up corpses, often a leg or arm would fall off. “Without the slightest hesitation,” reported the  Herald, “it would be thrown with the rest of the body,” much like a fruit vendor tossing an apple back onto their cart. The grave diggers hooted with delight when they found gold and jewelry. Flannery failed to get the crematorium running for the first couple days, so bodies were piled in an open pit. Residents complained of the smell. By the third day, the brick oven was functioning. Workers, who had been sleeping in the graveyard in a crude shack, eating beans and macaroni cooked over a fire, began to incinerate the bodies. The process was not smooth, and the number of grave diggers dwindled, causing the foreman to ply the remaining men with whiskey.</p><p> 1890年，国家决定摆脱SEGE点的坟墓。官员聘请了一名名叫仙女掌先生的疏浚承包商将尸体挖掘并在坦克烤箱内的现场发烧它们。纽约先驱报先生的一系列文章占据了粗心和可怕的过程。雇用的男人挖出尸体，通常腿部或手臂会脱落。 “没有丝毫的犹豫，”报道了先驱，“它会随着身体的其余部分抛出，”就像一个水果供应商扔了一个苹果回到他们的购物车。当他们找到黄金和珠宝时，坟墓的梦想家很高兴。邪恶未能获得第一个夫妇的火葬场运行，所以尸体被堆积在一个露天的坑里。居民抱怨闻起来。在第三天，砖烤箱运作。曾经在坟墓的墓地中睡过头，吃豆子和通心粉的工人，开始焚烧身体。这个过程并不顺利，坟墓的数量被欺骗，导致工头们用威士忌为剩下的人。</p><p> Every body was supposed to have been exhumed, cremated, and buried on Swinburne Island, just off the coast from Seguine Point. But not everything went to plan and the remains didn’t all get buried; the crematorium blew the ashes out to sea. But after reading the  Herald’s account, I can’t be confident the contractor got every last body from this poorly maintained and haphazardly organized cemetery.</p><p> 每个人都应该被挖掘，被火化，并埋在斯威士岛，刚刚从海岸从SEGEINE点开始。但并非一切都在计划，遗骸并非所有人都被埋葬了;火葬场将灰烬吹到海边。但是在阅读了先驱警习的账户之后，我无法自信，承包商得到了这一切的最后一个身体，从这种不良和随意组织的墓地。</p><p>  Today, the burial ground at Seguine Point is covered by Wolfe’s Pond Park, a large recreational area with a rocky beach. As I walk on the beach, the tide is out and pairs of men with boots and pitchforks dig up rocks in search of bloodworms for bait. Flocks of Brant, down from Canada for the winter, honk and dive for food just past the shore.</p><p>  今天，Segine Point的墓地被沃尔夫的池塘公园覆盖，这是一个带有岩石海滩的大型娱乐区。当我走在海滩上时，潮流就会出来，靴子与靴子和干草叉挖岩石以寻找诱饵的血腥。布兰特群，从加拿大为冬天，鸣喇叭和潜水到岸边。 </p><p> I push up from the beach through a thicket of seagrass, northern bayberry, and phragmites to what contemporary maps call the “BBQ area.” In the place of the old burial grounds is a wide-open field, quite flat, with picnic tables. There is an intentional-seeming diversity of trees planted at unimaginative and awkwardly even intervals; sycamores and red oaks mix with paper birches and ginkgos. Goose mess carpets the squishy grass. The only other people in the BBQ area are two middle-aged women with matching red hair and red jackets sitting more than a hundred yards away.</p><p>我从海滩上推到海滩，丛生的海湾，北部的北部和芦苇以及当代地图叫“烧烤区”。在旧埋地的地方是一个广阔的领域，相当平坦，野餐表。有意似乎在难以想象的且笨拙的间隔种植的树木; Sycamores和Red Oaks与纸桦树和Ginkgos混合。鹅混乱地毯鳞草状的草。烧烤区中唯一的其他人是两个中年妇女，配有匹配的红头发和红色夹克，距离一百码以上。</p><p> It is more than likely that there are human remains buried in this marshy BBQ area, yet there’s no memorial. I am also suspicious that there are Marine Hospital employees buried near the day care in St. George, because I cannot find any records of disinterment. News reports suggest that developers disturbed the on-site quarantine graves at least twice in the twentieth century, once as recently as 1957 when the corner where the plaza now stands was turned into a parking lot. One local claims that during construction she once saw a dump truck full of bones. She followed it to the water and watched as the contents were emptied into the harbor.</p><p> 在这个沼泽的烧烤区中有可能埋葬人类仍然存在，但没有纪念馆。我也怀疑，海洋医院员工在圣乔治靠近日托附近埋藏，因为我找不到任何令人失望的记录。新闻报道表明，开发人员在二十世纪至少两次打扰了现场检疫坟墓，曾经是1957年，当时Plaza现在已经成为停车场的角落。一个本地声称，在建造期间，她曾经看到一个装满骨骼的垃圾桶。她跟着水，看着内容被清空到港口。</p><p>   I found a number online for the group responsible for the lone gravestone at the courthouse and dialed. A woman on the other end of the line answered and was surprised when I told her I was writing about the island’s forgotten quarantine burial grounds. She said, emphatically, that “it is  absolutely no secret that there are quarantine burial grounds on Staten Island,  every history book mentions them.” Then she said she wasn’t going to talk to me on a cell phone and hurried off the line. I felt a little silly for thinking I might find a latter-day facsimile of the abandoned cemetery caretaker Mr. Hunter, from Joseph Mitchell’s  1956 story. Mitchell’s character is warm, nostalgic, and happy to talk at length. My memorialist was not interested in me and my own petty investigation into the incompleteness of memorials. She protects and rehabilitates abandoned cemeteries, and maybe that was enough. You can’t interrogate the desire to protect abandoned graves too much because it is a bottomless task. Do we need to keep clean and protect all graves for all of time? Of course not. We just do what we can. We establish tributes as an expression of our own thin, fleeting dominion over history.</p><p>   我在网上找到了一个号码，为法院队负责孤独的墓碑并拨打。一个女人在那里的另一端回答，当我告诉她我写了关于岛上被遗忘的检疫埋葬地面时感到惊讶。她强调，“这绝对没有秘密，即在史坦伦岛上有隔离墓地，每个历史书都提到了他们。”然后她说她不会在手机上跟我说话，并匆匆走出这条线。我觉得有点愚蠢地思考我可能会发现废弃的公墓看护人亨特先生的后期传感器，从约瑟夫米切尔的1956年故事。米切尔的角色是温暖的，怀旧的，乐于谈论长度。我的纪念碑对我并不感兴趣，以及我自己的小调查纪念馆的不完整性。她保护和恢复被遗弃的墓地，也许就够了。你无法审问保护废弃坟墓的愿望太多，因为它是一个无底的任务。我们是否需要保持清洁和保护所有坟墓？当然不是。我们只是做我们所能的事情。我们建立朝鲜作为我们自己瘦的表达，在历史上表达了巨大的统治。</p><p> Never forget, we often say, knowing all the while that we must forget in order to function on a daily basis. Cemeteries, while so solid-seeming, are just blips in the slipstream of history, an attempt to control time and hoard memories that we all know will fade. Soon they’ll be covered in a layer of sediment. Most of the ten thousand people who died of infectious diseases on Staten Island in the nineteenth century are and will be forgotten. We claim to remember them when it is useful to the present, as it must have been in 2002, when someone decided after almost seventy years that they would publicly re-remember the burial grounds. Cultural memory, clearly, is not contiguous. The past is a mess.</p><p> 永远不要忘记，我们经常说，知道我们必须忘记以便每天起作用。墓地，虽然如此坚实的似乎，只是在历史上的滑翔中削弱，试图控制时间和囤积的记忆，以至于我们所有人都会褪色。很快他们将被藏在一层沉积物中。大多数在十九世纪死于史特纳岛的传染病的万人都是忘记的。我们声称当它对现在有用时会记住它们，因为它一定是2002年，当有人在近七十年后决定他们会公开重新记住埋葬地。文化记忆，显然，不是连续的。过去是一团糟。</p><p> During the coronavirus pandemic, Staten Island once again has to deal with the interment of unclaimed bodies of plague victims. In April 2020 the public administrator for Richmond County  announced that five people who had died of Covid-19 were still unclaimed. If they weren’t spoken for, they would be buried at one of four cemeteries, based on their religion. The Associated Press  reported a story at the same time about Mount Richmond Cemetery, where Jews who die poor or unclaimed are buried. “A century ago,” according to the article, the cemetery “buried garment workers killed in the Triangle Shirtwaist fire and those who fell to the Spanish flu. More recently, it was Holocaust survivors who fled Europe.” The cemetery has struggled to keep up with burials during the Covid-19 pandemic, burying almost ten times as many people as usual.</p><p> 在冠状病毒大流行期间，史丹岛再次必须处理瘟疫受害者无人认领的机构。 2010年4月，里士满县的公共管理人员宣布，五名死于Covid-19的人仍然无人认领。如果他们没有说出，他们将根据他们的宗教来埋葬四个墓地之一。联邦新闻报告了一个关于里士满公墓的同时报告了一个故事，其中埋葬了死亡或无人认领的犹太人。 “一个世纪前，”根据这篇文章，墓地“埋葬服装工人在三角形裙子火灾中丧生，那些落到西班牙流感的人。最近，它是逃离欧洲的大屠杀幸存者。“墓地在Covid-19大流行期间努力跟上埋葬，像往常一样埋葬几乎十年的人。</p><p> At the time I was walking around Staten Island, more people  were dying in the borough than anywhere else in the city, much like in the late 1840s. Richmond County officials worked to make sure Staten Islanders were buried on the island and not sent to  Hart’s Island, the city’s main cemetery for unclaimed bodies.</p><p> 当我在史特纳岛散步时，越来越多的人比城市的任何地方都在自治堡中死亡，就像在1840年代后期一样。里士满县官员曾努力确保史泰肯岛民被埋葬在岛上，而不是送到哈特岛，这座城市的主要墓地是无人认领的机构。</p><p> But without a site like the Marine Hospital, that choke point and locus of disease, the bodies of Covid-19 victims will simply be scattered among the rest of the dead. Their gravesites will not become a place to collectively mourn our experience of mass death. Every Staten Island history book will likely mention the coronavirus pandemic, and many might mention the borough’s attempt to keep the bodies buried on the island. But will we remember? What remains of nineteenth-century gravesites suggest that we will, but only if we need to.</p><p> 但是没有像海洋医院这样的网站，那个疾病的窒息点和遗迹，Covid-19受害者的尸体将只是在死者的其余部分中分散。他们的坟墓不会成为集体哀悼我们对大规模死亡经历的地方。每个史泰登岛历史书都会提到冠状病毒大流行，许多人可能会提到自治市镇试图让身体埋在岛上。但我们会记得吗？ 19世纪坟墓的遗体表明我们会的，但只有我们需要。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/revisiting-dead">https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/revisiting-dead</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/审视/">#审视</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/墓地/">#墓地</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
