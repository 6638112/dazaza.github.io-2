She had 20 batteries to replace in the cavernous, 85-degree warehouse that day.</p><p>Shannon等待抱着肌肉在肩膀上拉着一个50英镑的电池进入其架子，但她忽略了痛苦并继续前进。当天，她有20个电池更换在海绵体，85度的仓库中。</p><p> Hauling batteries is a major part of the job for Wait and hundreds of other workers like her at Google&#39;s data centers. They&#39;d tried switching to automated machines during her two years working in the Berkeley County, South Carolina facility, but that stopped after only a few weeks when one of the machines pinned a co-worker to a wall.</p><p> 牵引电池是等待和在谷歌和＃39;数据中心等待像她这样的其他工人的主要部分。他们尝试在南卡罗来纳州伯克利县工作的两年内尝试切换到自动化机器，但在其中一台机器钉在一堵墙时，只有几周后停止。</p><p> Despite the heavy lifting, many of the workers in Google&#39;s 14 U.S. data centers at least start out enjoying the work. It&#39;s a tech job for people with no tech experience. It pays relatively well ($15 per hour for most contract workers). And while it&#39;s physically demanding, it&#39;s nothing like working at an Amazon fulfillment center or the local Walmart.</p><p> 尽管沉重的举重，但许多工人在谷歌＆＃39;第14位美国数据中心至少开始享受工作。它与没有科技经验的人的技术工作。它相对较好（大多数合同工人每小时15美元）。虽然它的身体要求＆＃39; s＆＃39; s什么都不喜欢在亚马逊履行中心或当地沃尔玛工作。</p><p>  But Wait and other workers like her who keep the data centers running are not actually Google employees. While as many as half the workers in some data centers actually work for Google, make Google salaries and get all those famous Google perks, the other half don&#39;t. For data center contractors specifically, that difference can extend beyond second-tier social status to job insecurity and forced unemployment.</p><p>  但是等待像她这样的其他工人，他们保持数据中心跑步不是谷歌员工。虽然一些数据中心的一半工人实际上适用于谷歌，但制作谷歌工资并获得所有着名的Google Perks，另一半不＆＃39; t。具体而言，对于数据中心承包商来说，这种差异可以超越二线社会地位，以求职和强迫失业。</p><p> Protocol spoke with four contract and full-time Google employees in three of the 14 U.S. locations for this story, all of whom were granted anonymity for fear of losing their jobs (except for Wait, whose data center contract recently ended).</p><p> 议定书与四个合同和全职谷歌员工谈到了14名美国的三个合同和全职谷歌员工的这个故事，所有这些都是害怕失去失去工作的匿名性（除了等待，最近结束的数据中心合同除外）。</p><p>  Google calls workers like Wait temporary, vendor or contract staff — TVCs, for short. Data center TVCs sign up for two-year jobs with Modis Engineering, a branch of the second-largest global contracting company, the Adecco Group. They are called &#34;Level 1&#34; employees, and they usually start with no previous experience or specialty skills. They are trained on the job to perform repair and maintenance tasks on the data center floor, and they work in close partnership with Google employees, many of whom do similar or even identical work. Some contractors even train new Googlers on some of their tasks.</p><p>  谷歌呼叫等待临时，供应商或合同工作人员的工人 -  TVCS，短暂。 Data Center TVCS与Modis Engineersing，第二大全球缔约公司，Adecco集团的分支注册了两年的职位。它们被称为＃34; 1级＆＃34;员工，他们通常从以前的经验或专业技能开始。他们受过工作培训，在数据中心楼层上执行维修和维护任务，他们与谷歌员工密切合作，其中许多人都有类似甚至相同的工作。一些承包商甚至培训了一些任务的新歌谣。</p><p> But those two-year contracts are written in stone. Workers like Wait are not usually allowed to apply either to renew their contracts or to do the same job as a Google employee. If they want to keep working in the same job, they have to leave the data center for six months and then come back and apply again — but neither Google nor Modis will tell workers why.</p><p> 但这两年的合同是用石头写的。等待的工人通常不能允许申请续订合同或与谷歌员工做同样的工作。如果他们想继续在同一工作中工作，他们必须离开数据中心六个月，然后再次回来申请 - 但谷歌和MODIS都不会告诉工人为什么。 </p><p>  One Level 1 worker, based in a data center in Iowa, will have to leave his TVC job in July. &#34;My two years is going to be coming up. They call it the six-month exclusion thing. I&#39;ll have to leave for six months before I can apply to come back,&#34; he told Protocol. He&#39;s worried about finding a job for six months when his contract expires in July. The pandemic already left many people unemployed in his area who still can&#39;t find jobs, and he wants to know why he has to become one of them when Google will likely simply hire someone else to replace him.</p><p>一级1级工人，位于爱荷华州的数据中心，将在7月份留下他的TVC工作。 ＆＃34;我的两年将来会出现。他们称之为六个月的排除物。我必须在申请回来之前留下六个月，＆＃34;他告诉议定书。他担心他的合同在7月到期时找到了六个月的工作。大流行已经让许多人失业在他的地区，仍然可以找到工作，并且他想知道为什么他必须成为其中一个人，因为谷歌可能只是雇用别人来取代他。</p><p> &#34;The only complaint I have is the fact that I have to leave for six months. I don&#39;t feel that&#39;s right that TVCs get recycled like this,&#34; he said. &#34;I&#39;ve never gotten a real answer as of why. And they train people, and they let them go, and then they have to train people all over again. It seems like a bad business model. That&#39;s my life right now. It&#39;s bizarre.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我唯一的抱怨是我必须离开六个月。我没有觉得它的＆＃39; tvcs像这样回收，＆＃34;他说。 ＆＃34;我从未有过真正的答案。他们训练了人，他们让他们走了，然后他们必须再次训练人们。这似乎是一个不好的商业模式。现在是我的生活。它＆＃39; s bizarre。＆＃34;</p><p>  Google likely requires the six-month leave due to federal employment law, Barbara Figari, an employment attorney in California, told Protocol.</p><p>  谷歌可能需要由于联邦就业法，加利福尼亚州的就业律师芭芭拉Figari，告诉议定书。</p><p> Under existing IRS guidelines, a company can&#39;t arbitrarily determine which workers are full employees and which are contractors. The business has to be able to prove when a worker meets certain  key legal definitions about contract work, and, if they fail, they would be required to treat the contractor as if they were an employee, according to Figari.</p><p> 根据现有的美国国税局指南，一家公司可以随意确定哪位工人是完整的员工，这是承包商。据意大利州法蒂略，当一名工人符合合同工作的某些关键法律定义时，企业必须能够证明一项关于合同工作的某些关键法律定义，据意大利设施如下。</p><p>  &#34;One of those guidelines is whether there is a written contract or employment benefits. The other aspect is, is the relationship a continuing one, and is it a key aspect of the business,&#34; Figari said. Companies will try to work around this by saying: &#34;If it&#39;s cut off at a specific timeline, we were able to get by without them for six months. They are not a key aspect of our business, and [the role] is not a continuing one,&#34; she explained.</p><p>  ＆＃34;其中一个指导方针是是否存在书面合同或就业福利。另一方面是，是关系一个继续的方面，它是业务的关键方面，＆＃34;菲达说。公司将尝试解决以下问题：＆＃34;如果它在特定时间表中切断，我们就可以在没有它们六个月的情况下获得。他们不是我们业务的关键方面，而且[角色]不是一个继续的，＆＃34;她解释道。</p><p> Google has long said contractors get treated differently from employees —  different pay, different badges, no swag, no events — explicitly to maintain that boundary. They are not Google employees, so of course they don&#39;t get Google benefits.</p><p> 谷歌已经长期以来，承包商与员工不同的方式对待 - 不同的工资，不同的徽章，没有赃物，没有事件 - 明确地保持这种边界。他们不是谷歌员工，所以他们当然不会得到谷歌的好处。</p><p> But in the data centers, one full-time Google employee told Protocol that both groups of workers often do exactly the same work. &#34;At our site, it&#39;s a smaller team, so it&#39;s a lot easier for us to have personal relationships with the contractors,&#34; he explained. &#34;From the top down, there is a very clear division, and especially at other sites, they get treated like second class citizens, really.&#34;</p><p> 但在数据中心，一个全职谷歌员工告诉议定书，两组工人经常做得完全相同的工作。 ＆＃34;在我们的网站，它＆＃39;是一个较小的团队，所以它更容易让我们与承包商拥有个人关系，＆＃34;他解释道。 ＆＃34;从顶部下来，有一个非常明确的部门，特别是在其他网站上，他们像二等公民一样对待。＆＃34; </p><p> The contract workers are not allowed to use certain tools that would make their jobs easier, according to this Google staffer. For example, they don&#39;t have permissions to access some of those software tools that would improve diagnostics, he explained. And the smaller stuff makes him angry, too. He knows he would be reprimanded if he gave a contractor a Google t-shirt handed out for free during an event. &#34;But there&#39;s no issue if they go on the Google merchandise store and buy it themselves,&#34; he said.</p><p>根据这位谷歌的员工，合同工人不允许使用某些工具，这些工具将使自己的工作更容易。例如，他们解释说，他们有权访问将改善诊断的一些软件工具。较小的东西也让他生气。如果他在活动期间免费发放谷歌T恤，他会知道他会被谴责。 ＆＃34;但是，如果他们继续谷歌商品商店，那么没有问题，并且自己购买它，＆＃34;他说。</p><p>  The aforementioned Iowa contractor even trains Google employees. &#34;The other day, I was training Googlers. I have more expertise and knowledge in this than the Googlers that they hire,&#34; he said. &#34;We&#39;re doing the same exact job, but we&#39;re getting paid like half of what we&#39;re worth.&#34;</p><p>  上述IOWA承包商甚至训练了谷歌员工。 ＆＃34;前几天，我正在训练陀螺仪。这比他们雇用的陀螺仪在这方面拥有更多的专业知识和知识，＆＃34;他说。 ＆＃34;我们做了相同的确切工作，但我们＆＃39;重新获得报酬，如我们的一半。＆＃34;</p><p> Protocol asked why the workers are required to take six-month leaves between contracts, but Google did not provide a clear explanation. &#34;Temporary staff work on a Google assignment for a fixed amount of time to cover short-term leaves, when we have spikes in business needs, or when we need to quickly incubate special projects,&#34; a Google spokesperson replied.</p><p> 议定书询问为什么工人需要在合同之间服用六个月的叶子，但谷歌没有提供明确的解释。 ＆＃34;临时工作人员在谷歌分配上工作，以固定的时间覆盖短期叶子，当我们在业务需求中有巨大时，或者我们需要快速孵化特殊项目时，＆＃34;谷歌发言人回答道。</p><p> &#34;I&#39;m not aware of any law that would say two years as a guidance, but longer than two years would raise a question, that really could be more of an employment,&#34; Figari told Protocol.</p><p> ＆＃34;我不知道任何愿意这两个年作为指导的法律，但长度超过两年会提出一个问题，这真的可能更多的就业，＆＃34; Figari告诉协议。</p><p>  Some of the Level 1 workers, such as Wait, want the relationship to be a continuing one. When she first took the job at the Berkeley County facility in 2018, it was a stopgap to help fill the time and pay the bills while she pursued her master&#39;s degree. Once she started, though, she found she enjoyed the technical, challenging and engaging work of learning how to repair servers, replace batteries and install the hardware needed to expand the data center. Her bosses told her that before her two-year contract ended, she might be able to apply to do the same job, actually for Google.</p><p>  一些级别的工人，例如等待，希望关系成为一个继续的。当她在2018年首次在伯克利县设施工作时，这是一个停止填补时间并在追求她的主人＆＃39; S学位时支付账单。但是，一旦开始，她发现她享受了学习如何修复服务器的技术，挑战和吸引力的工作，更换电池并安装展开数据中心所需的硬件。她的老板告诉她，在她两年的合同结束之前，她可能可以申请做同样的工作，实际上是为了谷歌。</p><p>  &#34;There seemed to be a promise that if you work hard and you are successful, you too might be able to transfer from being a contractor to a Googler, or a full-time employee,&#34; Wait said. &#34;It was nice knowing that I could potentially make a career out of that if for some reason being a professor didn&#39;t work out some day.&#34; But after her first year of employment, Wait started &#34;hearing rumors&#34; that Google wasn&#39;t hiring any more Level 1 data technicians as Google employees, and that all the positions would be contract-only going forward.</p><p>  ＆＃34;似乎是一个承诺，如果你努力工作，你成功，你也可能能够从承包商转移到吉说者，或全职员工，＆＃34;等待说。 ＆＃34;很高兴知道我可能会在某种原因成为一名教授，我可能会使职业生涯脱颖而出。＆＃34;但在她的第一年的就业后，等待开始＆＃34;听证谣言＆＃34;谷歌＆＃39; t雇用任何级别的1级数据技术人员作为谷歌员工，并且所有职位都将是合同的。</p><p> Suddenly, the twinge in her shoulder from her daily quota of battery replacements felt heavier, somehow. Less worth it. Everyone was less happy in their work. &#34;No one really saw a light at the end of the tunnel, once we realized that Google wasn&#39;t going to be hiring any more Googlers that were working the position we were working,&#34; Wait said. Her contract ended in February, and she went back to grad school. Working as a data tech is her past, not her future.</p><p> 突然间，她的肩膀中的速度从她的日常电池替代品的配额含量较重，不知何故。不值得。每个人都在他们的工作中不太开心。 ＆＃34;一旦我们意识到谷歌，没有人在隧道末端真的看到了一片灯光，谷歌是谁雇用更多正在雇用我们工作的职位的歌谣，＆＃34;等待说。她的合同结束于二月，她回到了毕业生。作为数据技术工作是她的过去，而不是她的未来。 </p><p> &#34;I have a lot of friends who have claimed unemployment, because they couldn&#39;t find anything at the end of the two years,&#34; Wait said.</p><p>＆＃34;我有很多声称失业的朋友，因为他们无法在两年结束时找到任何东西，而＃34;等待说。</p><p>  The Iowa data center technician is in a different position than Wait. He&#39;d worked in other related jobs before he got the contract with Modis in 2019. When he learned Google wouldn&#39;t be directly hiring Level 1s to do the same job in-house, he thought he might be able to apply for the Level 2 equivalent, called DT2. Those jobs usually require five or six years of experience as a Level 1 contractor for someone brand new to the field — a hard level to reach when workers have to leave for six months after every two years — but because of his previous experience, he might be able to study hard enough to apply by the time his two-year contract is up.</p><p>  爱荷华州数据中心技术人员比等待在不同的位置。他在2019年与Modis合同之前工作在其他相关的工作岗位之前。当他学会了谷歌＆＃39; t直接雇用1级，在内部做同样的工作，他认为他可能能够申请2级等效，称为DT2。这些工作通常需要五六年的一六年作为1级承包商的一个居民，为田野的一个全新 - 当工人在每两年后六个月后达到艰难的水平 - 但由于他以前的经验，他可能会能够在他的两年合同上努力学习足够的申请。</p><p> &#34;To get into Level 2, it&#39;s very difficult. I&#39;m pretty close now, but making me take six months off…,&#34; he started. He had a hard time finishing the sentence. He doesn&#39;t think he will be ready to apply for a Google job before he is forced to quit.</p><p> ＆＃34;进入2级，它非常困难。我现在很接近，但让我休息六个月......，＆＃34;他开始。他有很难完成判决。他认为他将在被迫戒烟之前准备申请谷歌工作。</p><p> &#34;Vendors, temporary staff and contractors have always been welcome to apply for any full-time jobs and go through the same hiring process as any other qualified candidate,&#34; a Google spokesperson told Protocol.</p><p> ＆＃34;供应商，临时员工和承包商一直欢迎申请任何全职工作，并通过与其他合格的候选人相同的招聘流程，＆＃34;谷歌发言人告诉议定书。</p><p>  While Wait was willing to tolerate the way Google limited contractor perks when she had a chance of becoming a Googler herself, the end of that dream made her pay more attention to the small things: She couldn&#39;t get her water bottle replaced when it broke, she couldn&#39;t attend Google &#34;TGI Fridays,&#34; she couldn&#39;t wear a Google T-shirt. Then she got angry about the big things: All of her coworkers had back problems, Googlers were making double the salary for half the physical labor and she was warned that she might be fired for talking about COVID-related emergency hazard pay that Google had promised but not yet paid (the company eventually followed through with payment). She posted an angry discussion of working conditions and salary on her personal Facebook page.</p><p>  虽然等待愿意容忍Google Limited承包商津贴的方式，但当她有机会成为一个吉说者自己，那梦想的结束让她更加关注小事：她不能让她的水瓶更换它破了，她不能参加谷歌＆＃34; TGI星期五，＆＃34;她不能戴上谷歌T恤。然后她对大事生气了：她所有的同事都有回来的问题，陀螺队正在为一个身体劳动的一半薪水加倍，她被警告说，她可能被解雇了谈论谷歌所承诺的Covid相关的紧急危险支付但尚未支付（公司最终通过付款）。她在她的个人Facebook页面上发表了对工作条件和薪水的愤怒讨论。</p><p>  That&#39;s when Modis took her badge and told her to go home. (Modis did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) &#34;They said I was a security risk, that I might have violated the non-disclosure agreement that I signed by complaining about working conditions. They took my badge and my laptop, and security removed me from the site. They followed me out the door,&#34; she said.</p><p>  那个＆＃39;■当Modis带她的徽章并告诉她回家。 （Modis没有响应多个评论请求。）＆＃34;他们说我是一种安全风险，我可能已经违反了我通过抱怨工作条件签署的不披露协议。他们带着我的徽章和我的笔记本电脑，安全删除了我的网站。他们跟着我门，＆＃34;她说。</p><p> Wait, however, already had a meeting scheduled  with the Alphabet Workers Union for the next day — she joined as soon as they went public in January. The newly-formed group jumped at the chance to help her, as they knew her dismissal had likely been illegal. All workers that are employed by a company (not independent contractors, who are self-employed) are allowed to talk about wages and working conditions in their workplace; it&#39;s one of the few iron-clad protections under federal labor law. While this law is only enforced when someone complains to the National Labor Relations Board, an employer explicitly telling a worker they can&#39;t talk about wages is the kind of thing the NLRB takes very seriously.</p><p> 然而，等待第二天的字母工人联盟已经开会了 - 她一旦公开就在1月份就加入。新成立的小组有机会帮助她，因为他们知道她解雇可能是非法的。所有由公司（不是独立承包商而非独立承包商）允许在其工作场所讨论工资和工作条件;它＆＃39;少数钢铁包裹保护下的少数钢铁制品之一。虽然这项法律只会在有人向国家劳工关系委员会抱怨国家劳工关系委员会时执行，但一个雇主明确地告诉工人，他们可以＆＃39; T谈论工资是NLRB非常重视的那种东西。 </p><p>  The lawyers at the Communications Workers of America filed unfair labor practice charges on Wait&#39;s behalf. While regular legal proceedings can take ages,  the negative press was so overwhelming that Modis almost immediately agreed to give Wait her job back. And about two months later, in early April, Modis and Google settled the charges with the NLRB,  agreeing to post large, bold signs across the Berkeley County facility reminding workers that they are allowed to talk about their pay and working conditions both in and out of the workplace.</p><p>美国通信工人的律师提出了不公平的劳务实践指控。虽然普通法律程序可能需要年龄，但负面的印刷机如此压倒性地，Modis几乎立即同意给予自己的工作。大约两个月后，4月初，Modis和Google与NLRB结算了指控，同意在伯克利县设施的大型大胆迹象，提醒工人，他们被允许谈论他们的薪酬和工作条件工作场所。</p><p> Wait&#39;s contract expired in February, before she could get the chance to enjoy her victory, and she left the data center with no plans to come back.</p><p> 等待＆＃39;在2月份到期，在享受胜利的机会之前，她留下了胜利，而且没有计划回来的数据中心。</p><p> Her new friends from the data center don&#39;t have the same luxury, so she&#39;s not abandoning her support for the Alphabet Workers Union or her newfound interest in labor law. &#34;A lot of my friends who have children are using welfare in order to make ends meet. Most of them wait the six months this way, and then go back to working again. That is six months of not working. And I do not understand how they are able to make it during that time,&#34; Wait said.</p><p> 她的新朋友来自数据中心＆＃39; T具有相同的奢侈品，所以她并没有放弃她对劳动法的新发现兴趣的支持。 ＆＃34;我有很多有孩子正在使用福利的朋友，以便达到结束。他们中的大多数人都等了六个月，然后再回去工作了。这是不工作的六个月。我不明白他们在那段时间内能够做到这一点，＆＃34;等待说。</p><p> She added: &#34;And I know for a fact that some Googlers really appreciate that I stood up for my coworkers by forcing the world to look at how Google uses contracting agencies and staffing agencies to subsidize their labor.&#34;</p><p> 她补充说：＆＃34;我知道一些陀螺仪真的很感激我通过强迫世界来看看谷歌如何使用签约机构和人员配备机构来补贴他们的劳动力来支持我的同事。＆＃34; </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.protocol.com/google-contractors-forced-unemployment">https://www.protocol.com/google-contractors-forced-unemployment</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
