Holly Williams explores a remarkable career – and the nature of fame.</p><p>在18世纪，他制定了今天的议程#39；查尔斯·迪布丁（Charles Dibdin）是美国的超级巨星，但后来基本上被遗忘了。霍莉·威廉姆斯探索了一个非凡的职业生涯——以及名声的本质。</p><p> Think of an era-defining, wildly popular pop star: are you picturing David Bowie? Prince? Elton John? Maybe Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga or Adele? The solo singer-songwriter, whose persona is as well-known as their music and lyrics, is a cornerstone of popular music.</p><p>想一想一个定义时代、广受欢迎的流行歌星：你在画大卫·鲍伊吗？王子埃尔顿·约翰？也许是泰勒·斯威夫特、Lady Gaga或阿黛尔？这位独唱歌手兼词曲作者是流行音乐的基石，他的个性与他们的音乐和歌词一样广为人知。</p><p> Yet none of those names achieved anything like the domination of arguably Britain&#39;s first popular music star: Charles Dibdin. If the name isn&#39;t familiar, that&#39;s probably because he died in 1814 – although you might recognise the tune of one of his many nautical songs, Tom Bowling, often featured in the UK&#39;s popular annual classical concert, Last Night of the Proms.</p><p>然而，这些名字中没有一个能达到英国的统治地位#39；英国第一位流行音乐明星：查尔斯·迪丁。如果名字不是&#39；我不熟悉，那&#39；这可能是因为他死于1814年——尽管你可能会认出他众多航海歌曲中的一首，汤姆·保龄球，经常出现在英国&#39；她受欢迎的年度古典音乐会，舞会的最后一晚。</p><p>     Yet in his own lifetime – and indeed for half a century after his death – Dibdin was no one-hit wonder, but a hugely prolific, extremely famous figure. He performed in operas and then wrote his own, composed more than a thousand songs, toured one-man shows around the country, and opened his own London theatre. He penned several novels and a five-volume history of theatre. His own autobiography also stretched to four volumes – the largest memoir of the period, and a good indication of Dibdin&#39;s remarkable facility for self-promotion.</p><p>然而，在他自己的一生中——事实上，在他去世后的半个世纪里——迪布丁并不是一个轰动一时的奇迹，而是一个多产、极为著名的人物。他在歌剧中表演，然后创作了自己的歌剧，创作了1000多首歌曲，在全国各地巡回演出了单人剧，并开办了自己的伦敦剧院。他写了几部小说和一部五卷的戏剧史。他自己的自传也长达四卷——这是该时期最大的回忆录，很好地体现了迪丁&#39；这是一个非常好的自我推销工具。</p><p> &#34;He was the most dominant singer-songwriter that Britain has ever had,&#34; insists David Chandler, Professor of English Literature at Doshisha University in Kyoto, who has overseen the recent recording of several of Dibdin&#39;s shows for CD and digital streaming. &#34;Who is the great British singer-songwriter? Most people are going to choose someone alive or recently deceased – but most of those would have some competition [in their respective eras]. With Dibdin, you just have someone with no obvious rival. Nobody else could combine his performance skills and his musical talents, and his facility for writing lyrics,  and his ability to self-publicise, all in one. That&#39;s what makes him really unique.&#34;</p><p>&#34;他是英国有史以来最具统治力的歌手兼词曲作者；京都多西沙大学的英国文学教授戴维·钱德勒坚持认为，他负责最近录制了几首迪丁&#39；s播放CD和数字流媒体&#34;谁是伟大的英国歌手和词曲作者？大多数人会选择活着的人或最近去世的人——但大多数人（在各自的时代）会有一些竞争。有了迪丁，你就有了一个没有明显对手的人。没有人能将他的表演技巧、音乐天赋、作词技巧和自我宣传能力融为一体。那&#39；这就是他真正与众不同的地方&#34;</p><p>  Chandler first became fascinated by Dibdin because, as an academic researching the Romantic era, he kept tripping over Dibdin&#39;s name in newspapers. Dibdin clearly had a rather tempestuous nature, and was often getting into financial difficulties, fighting with the critics, and falling out dramatically with other figures in the London theatrical scene – including David Garrick, who exploited Dibdin&#39;s musical talents for his Drury Lane theatre in the 1760s and 1770s, when Dibdin was a young man.</p><p>钱德勒最初对迪布丁着迷是因为，作为一名研究浪漫主义时代的学者，他经常被迪布丁绊倒&#39；她在报纸上的名字。迪布丁显然有一种相当暴躁的天性，经常陷入财务困境，与批评者发生斗争，并与伦敦戏剧界的其他人物发生戏剧性的争吵——包括利用迪布丁的戴维·加里克&#39；17世纪60年代和17世纪70年代，迪布丁年轻时，他在德鲁里巷剧院发挥了音乐天赋。</p><p> Dibdin&#39;s reputation as being tricky to work with ultimately led to his staging one-man shows from 1787. He called these innovative, touring performances his &#34;Table Entertainments&#34;, and it is a selection of these – alongside The Jubilee, a work written for Garrick&#39;s bonanza Shakespeare festival in 1769 – that have lately been performed and recorded by  Retrospect Opera, with baritone Simon Butteriss bringing Dibdin back to life.</p><p>迪丁和#39；他的名声是很难合作，最终导致他从1787年开始举办单人表演。他把这些创新的巡回演出称为他的&#34；餐桌娱乐&#34；，这是其中的一个选择——除了为加里克&#39写的作品《禧年》；1769年的莎士比亚音乐节（bonanza Shakespeare festival）——最近由Retrospect Opera表演并录制，男中音西蒙·巴特里斯（Simon Butteriss）将迪丁带回了生活。</p><p> &#34;Dibdin made enemies, certainly, like a lot of large personalities do. And that&#39;s why he ended up having to work on his own,&#34; laughs Butteriss. &#34;It was a struggle – he very much had to do everything himself, having been feted at Drury Lane.&#34;</p><p>&#34;当然，迪布丁和许多大人物一样，也是敌人。那&#39；这就是他最终不得不独自工作的原因；巴特里斯笑了&#34;这是一场斗争——他在德鲁里巷（Drury Lane）受到了款待，所以一切都得自己做&#34;</p><p> The Table Entertainments, however, were a hit. A charming raconteur, Dibdin would play multiple characters, blending comic storytelling with songs played on the piano. In his most successful, titled The Wags, for instance, Dibdin conjures up a villa outside of London – a &#34;camp of pleasure&#34; where English eccentrics eat and drink, tell jokes and stories, and sing songs. First performed in 1790, The Wags was his fourth Table Entertainment, and saw Dibdin &#34;able to refine his product to the point where it had an almost perfect appeal,&#34; says Chandler. Dibdin performed it 108 times in its first London season alone – and went on to churn out new Table Entertainments for the next 20 years.</p><p>然而，餐桌上的娱乐活动很受欢迎。迪布丁是一个迷人的饶舌者，他会扮演多个角色，将喜剧故事与钢琴上的歌曲结合在一起。例如，在他最成功的作品《Wags》中，迪丁虚构了伦敦郊外的一座别墅——a&#34；欢乐营&#34；在这里，英国怪人吃喝、讲笑话、讲故事、唱歌。第一次表演是在1790年，Wags是他的第四个桌上娱乐节目，并观看了Dibdin&#34；能够改进他的产品，使其具有近乎完美的吸引力，&#34；钱德勒说。Dibdin仅在其第一个伦敦季就表演了108次，并在接下来的20年里大量推出了新的桌上娱乐节目。</p><p>  &#34;In the writing, he is so alive,&#34; says Butteriss, when asked about the attraction of Dibdin&#39;s work. &#34;I do the patter parts in Gilbert and Sullivan, and character roles in opera, and because I think more like an actor than a singer, it really appealed to me that there was so much dramatic and comic meat in his writing. He felt like a kindred spirit.&#34;</p><p>&#34;在写作中，他是如此的活跃，&#34；当被问及迪布丁的吸引力时，巴特里斯说；这是工作&#34;我在《吉尔伯特和沙利文》中扮演说唱部分，在歌剧中扮演角色，因为我觉得他更像一个演员而不是一个歌手，他的作品中有如此多的戏剧性和喜剧性内容，这真的吸引了我。他觉得自己是个志同道合的人&#34;</p><p>  While Butteriss acknowledges that many of Dibdin&#39;s songs wouldn&#39;t stand up as individual pieces, he suggests the narrative that Dibdin writes around them is what makes them compelling. &#34;His characters are brilliantly written, and it&#39;s all carefully devised so he can play all the parts – it becomes a bravura thing. There&#39;s one song called The Margate Hoy in which he plays about 10 characters simultaneously having a conversation with one another. It&#39;s very funny indeed – it&#39;s this tiny, seven-minute opera on its own, really.&#34;</p><p>Butteriss承认Dibdin和#39；s歌曲&#39；他认为，Dibdin围绕着这些作品所写的叙事，是它们引人注目的原因&#34;他笔下的人物写得很精彩，而且&#39；这一切都是精心设计的，所以他可以扮演所有角色——这成了一件非常棒的事情。那里&#39；有一首歌叫《马盖特·霍伊》，他在歌中同时扮演10个角色，彼此交谈。它&#39；这真的很有趣——它&#39；这是一部七分钟的小歌剧，真的&#34;</p><p> Outside of the London season, Dibdin toured these shows up and down the country – another innovation. &#34;As far as I know, no one had done this before: [touring as] literally a man and piano, and playing in a very wide range of venues,&#34; says Chandler. &#34;Public halls, private venues, clubs… he even did a private show for the Prince Regent.&#34;</p><p>在伦敦季之外，迪丁在全国各地巡回演出，这是另一项创新&#34;据我所知，以前没有人这样做过：（以男式和钢琴的身份巡演），在各种各样的场地演奏，&#34；钱德勒说&#34;公共大厅、私人场所、俱乐部……他甚至为摄政王做了一场私人演出&#34;</p><p>  But key to Dibdin&#39;s success was that his characters, stories and songs had wide appeal – they weren&#39;t just for the upper classes. &#34;Dibdin liked his connections to powerful people; he dedicated a book to the prince,&#34; Chandler says, but adds that Dibdin believed he could entertain anybody: &#34;He had a very broad cross-section of audience, that varied depending on where he was doing the show – the university towns, where you&#39;d get an intellectual, student audience, but also northern industrial centres. He talks about farmers coming to his show.&#34; He always enjoyed playing Liverpool, apparently, where his humour went down particularly well. And Dibdin&#39;s comic timing, stage presence and facility for a quick-witted ad-lib were certainly all part of the brand. &#34;His manner of coming upon the stage was in a happy style,&#34;  wrote his contemporary, playwright John O&#39;Keeffe. &#34;He ran on sprightly and with a nearly laughing face, like a friend who enters hastily to impart you some good news.&#34;</p><p>但Dibdin的关键是&#39；他的成功在于他的角色、故事和歌曲具有广泛的吸引力——它们不是&#39；这不仅仅是为了上层阶级&#34;迪布丁喜欢他与权势人物的关系；他为王子奉献了一本书&#34；钱德勒说，但他补充说，迪丁相信他可以招待任何人：&#34；他有一个非常广泛的观众群体，这取决于他做节目的地方——大学城，你&#39；d有知识分子、学生观众，但也有北方工业中心。他说农民会来参加他的表演&#34; 显然，他总是喜欢在利物浦踢球，他的幽默感在那里表现得特别好。和迪丁&#39；该品牌的喜剧时机、舞台表演和机智的即兴表演都是该品牌的一部分&#34;他上台时的样子很愉快&#34；与他同时代的剧作家约翰·O&#39；基夫&#34;他快活地跑着，脸上几乎带着笑，就像一个朋友急忙进来告诉你一个好消息&#34;</p><p> You could even see Dibdin&#39;s shows as a very early form of stand-up; there are tales of him sparring with drunk hecklers. &#34;I think he is very much part of the history of stand-up as well,&#34; says Chandler. Such was the success of his solo shows, Dibdin was able to open his own small theatre, the Sans Souci, in London in 1795 to host them – also an unheard-of thing for a performer at the time. &#34;It was a tiny theatre, but it was a place people wanted to be seen,&#34; suggests Butteriss.</p><p>你甚至可以看到迪丁&#39；s是一种非常早期的站立形式；有他和醉酒的质问者争吵的故事&#34;我认为他也是单口相声历史的一部分；钱德勒说。1795年，迪布丁在伦敦开办了自己的小剧院“无苏奇”，主持了他的个人表演，这也是当时表演者闻所未闻的事情&#34;这是一个很小的剧院，但它是一个人们想被看到的地方；巴特利斯建议。</p><p>  Another of Dibdin&#39;s canniest moves was to pioneer merchandise: he would sell his own sheet music, as well as his books, at performances. His self-publishing approach means it&#39;s hard to tell exactly how popular his three novels really were, although we do know they appeared in more than one edition.</p><p>另一个是迪丁&#39；他最精明的举动是开创商品市场：他会在演出中出售自己的乐谱和书籍。他的自我出版方式意味着它&#39；It’很难说他的三部小说到底有多受欢迎，尽管我们知道它们出现在不止一个版本中。</p><p> More significant are the song sheets, which featured lyrics and scores for keyboard and a kind of widely played flute. &#34;One of Dibdin&#39;s strokes of genius was to start publishing his own music, which was not at all common [at the time],&#34; points out Chandler. &#34;He&#39;d sign each one – he must&#39;ve had these enormous signing sessions.&#34;</p><p>更重要的是歌曲表，其中包括歌词和键盘乐谱，以及一种广泛演奏的长笛&#34;迪布丁和#39；他的天才之举是开始出版他自己的音乐，这在当时根本不常见；钱德勒指出&#34;他&#39；d每个人都要签名——他必须&#39；我参加了大量的签约会议&#34;</p><p> It was another clever innovation – not only offering audiences a chance to take away a signed memento of a good night out, but also a way to make sure his tunes were heard more widely, sung at home or in taverns. As an indicator of how numerous and widely collected his songs were, in the Bodleian Library&#39;s collection of surviving Broadside ballads from the later 18th Century, a whopping 324 are by Dibdin – while his closest rival clocks in with only 11.</p><p>这是另一个聪明的创新——不仅让观众有机会拿走一个晚上外出时签了名的纪念品，还让观众可以更广泛地听到他的曲子，在家里或酒馆里演唱。作为他的歌曲数量和广泛收集的指标，在博德莱恩图书馆&#39；迪布丁收集了18世纪后期流传下来的旁白民谣，其中324首是迪布丁创作的，而他最亲密的对手只有11首。</p><p>  And this doesn&#39;t take into account how Dibdin fans might themselves make copies of someone else&#39;s score. Few such hand-written scores survive, but the practice was likely common – and we know it took place with Dibdin&#39;s work thanks to one very high-profile fan: Jane Austen. Her small music collection features several works by Dibdin, copied out in her own hand.</p><p>这并没有&#39；Don’不要考虑Dibdin的粉丝们自己可能会如何复制别人#39；s得分。很少有这样的手写分数幸存下来，但这种做法很可能很普遍——我们知道这发生在迪丁&#39；这要归功于一位非常引人注目的粉丝：简·奥斯汀。她的小型音乐收藏包括迪布丁的几部作品，这些作品是她亲手复制的。</p><p> She&#39;s not the only Dibdin acolyte: he&#39;s also thought to have been a major inspiration for Gilbert and Sullivan. &#34;Dibdin invented the English comic opera that they then developed,&#34; says Butteriss.</p><p>她&#39；他不是唯一的迪丁助手：他&#39；人们还认为这也是吉尔伯特和沙利文的主要灵感来源&#34;迪布丁发明了英国喜剧歌剧，后来他们又发展了这部歌剧；巴特里斯说。</p><p> Dibdin&#39;s operas were enormously popular not only in his lifetime, but throughout much of the 19th Century, and we know WS Gilbert saw Dibdin&#39;s work as a young man. Butteriss thinks his influence is explicit. &#34;[Gilbert] lifts the comedy naval language he puts in HMS Pinafore from Dibdin. And I think the audience would have recognised it – a homage, rather than a stealing.&#34;</p><p>迪丁和#39；吉尔伯特的歌剧不仅在他有生之年广受欢迎，而且在整个19世纪的大部分时间里都非常受欢迎，我们知道吉尔伯特的歌剧《迪丁与39》；他年轻时就开始工作了。巴特里斯认为他的影响是显而易见的&#34;[Gilbert]提升了他在Dibdin的HMS Pinafore中加入的喜剧海军语言。我想观众会认出这是一种敬意，而不是偷窃&#34;</p><p> Two of Dibdin&#39;s most successful operas, The Waterman (1774) and The Quaker (1775), were performed all over the anglophone world – and in Britain continued to be performed for up to hundred years afterwards, says Chandler. &#34;Which is incredible: no other opera of this period had such a long afterlife as those.&#34;</p><p>迪布丁和#39；钱德勒说，英国最成功的歌剧《沃特曼》（1774年）和《贵格会》（1775年）在英语世界各地演出，之后在英国继续演出长达数百年&#34;这是难以置信的：这一时期没有其他歌剧的来世如此之长&#34;</p><p>  Both Butteriss and Chandler would love to see his full-scale operas remounted – but we no longer have the original orchestral parts. Those that do exist, for The Waterman for example, hail from those productions from the mid-19th Century. How close these are to the originals is unclear – although they&#39;re potentially interesting in their own right. The 1840s – several decades after Dibdin&#39;s death – proved to be the peak moment for his legacy. As well as his operas still being staged, there was also a flush of interest in his songs, with numerous new editions published, including one ambitious collection by Charles Dickins&#39;s father-in-law, George Hogarth.</p><p>巴特里斯和钱德勒都希望看到他的大型歌剧重演——但我们不再拥有最初的管弦乐部分。那些确实存在的作品，比如《沃特曼》，来自19世纪中期的作品。目前尚不清楚它们与原作有多接近——尽管它们&#39；他们可能对自己感兴趣。19世纪40年代——迪丁之后的几十年&39；他的死——被证明是他遗产的巅峰时刻。除了他的歌剧仍在上演外，人们对他的歌曲也产生了浓厚的兴趣，出版了许多新版本，包括查尔斯·狄更斯（Charles Dickins）的一部雄心勃勃的作品集&#39；他的岳父乔治·霍格斯。</p><p> And then… a gradual fade into relative obscurity. A version of The Waterman was performed in Covent Garden in 1911. Another opera, Lionel and Clarissa, was revived at the Lyric Theatre in London in 1925. And people continue to record Tom Bowling to this day… Still, it&#39;s a sharp decline from Britain&#39;s most prolific and popular singer-songwriter to being remembered for one tune only.</p><p>然后…逐渐淡出相对的默默无闻。1911年，沃特曼的一个版本在考文特花园上演。另一部歌剧《莱昂内尔与克拉丽莎》于1925年在伦敦抒情剧院重演。直到今天，人们还在继续记录汤姆·保龄球……不过，它&#39；这与英国相比急剧下降&#39；她是世界上最多产、最受欢迎的歌手兼词曲作者，只因一首曲子而被人铭记。</p><p> So can Dibdin&#39;s afterlife tell us anything about what we might expect for the reputations of the pop stars of our own time – what afterlife we might anticipate for David Bowie, or Adele? Well, perhaps.</p><p>迪丁也可以&#39；s来世告诉我们，我们对我们这个时代的流行歌星的声誉有什么期待——我们对大卫·鲍伊（David Bowie）或阿黛尔（Adele）的来世有什么期待？也许吧。</p><p> &#34;For a whole generation after his death, Dibdin was really current, a lot of his songs were known,&#34; points out Chandler – as we now see with the most popular music of the 20th Century. &#34;There was about 60 years where a lot of English people would have known a number of Dibdin songs. But by the time you get to 80 years after his death, he&#39;s fading. So much new stuff comes along, some of the old just has to get displaced.&#34;</p><p>&#34;在他死后整整一代人的时间里，迪布丁真的很流行，他的很多歌曲都很出名，&#34；钱德勒指出——正如我们现在看到的20世纪最流行的音乐&#34;在大约60年的时间里，很多英国人都会知道一些迪丁歌曲。但当他去世80年后，他&#39；正在消退。新事物层出不穷，一些旧事物不得不被取代&#34;</p><p> Whether such a fate awaits pop stars in an era of Spotify remains to be seen. But as Dibdin proves, fame can be a fickle mistress – and there&#39;s no guarantee that being the most popular figure in one era means you&#39;ll be remembered in another.</p><p>在Spotify的时代，流行歌星是否会面临这样的命运还有待观察。但正如迪布丁所证明的那样，名望可以是一个变化无常的情妇——而且&#39；It’不能保证成为某个时代最受欢迎的人物意味着你&#39；我们将在另一个世界被铭记。</p><p> Charles Dibdin&#39;s The Wags, The Jubilee, and Christmas Gambols are available on CD and streaming platforms;   retrospectopera.org.uk</p><p>查尔斯·迪布丁&#39；在CD和流媒体平台上可以看到Wags、Jubilee和Christmas Gambols；回顾歌剧。组织。英国</p><p> If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our    Facebook  page or message us on    Twitter .</p><p>如果你想对这个故事或你在BBC文化上看到的任何东西发表评论，请访问我们的Facebook页面或在Twitter上给我们发消息。</p><p> And if you liked this story,    sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter , called The Essential List.
