trailer from Warner Bros. for director James Gunn&#39;s forthcoming\u00a0  The Suicide Squad,\u00a0in which Courtney reprises his role as Captain Boomerang from 2016&#39;s   Suicide Squad. It&#39;s got quite bit of new footage and some small additional details (such as why Idris Elba&#39;s Bloodsport is in prison in the first place). Each of the three trailers released so far has been better than the last, so we have high hopes for this film.\n As  I&#39;ve written previously,\u00a0 The Suicide Squad is not a direct sequel to the 2016 film; Gunn has said he wanted to take the franchise in a new direction and introduce new characters. He drew inspiration from writer\u00a0 John Ostrander&#39;s original 1980s  Suicide Squad comics. (Ostrander has a small role in the final film.) Gunn  has described his R-rated film as a superhero version of the classic 1967 film\u00a0  The Dirty Dozen, selecting characters he described as &#34;loser, B-grade supervillains.&#34;\n  Joel Kinnaman and Viola Davis reprise their 2016 roles as Col. Rick Flag and Intelligence Officer Amanda Waller, respectively, with Steve Agee playing John Economos, prison warden and aide to Waller. The squad this time around includes Elba&#39;s Bloodsport, Peacemaker (John Cena), Courtney&#39;s Captain Boomerang, Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), Savant (Michael Rooker), King Shark (voiced by Rooker&#39;s   Cliffhanger co-star Sylvester Stallone), Blackguard (Pete Davidson), Javelin (Flula Borg), and everyone&#39;s favorite psycho, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie).\n Other cast members include Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmalchian), whose trademark polka-dotted suit is actually a collection of gadgets; Weasel (Sean Gunn, James&#39; kid brother), an anthropomorphic weasel; Sol Soria (Alice Braga); TDK (Nathan Fillion); Mongal (Mayling Ng);\u00a0Flo Crawley (Tinashe Kajese); and Thinker (Peter Capaldi). Storm Reid plays\u00a0Bloodsport&#39;s daughter Tyla.\n Each of the prior trailers (released within a week of each other) had a very distinctive tone\u2014a deliberate choice by Gunn.\u00a0The  first was a red-band trailer (pretty tame as these things go) that played up the humor. It opened with a plan for Flag and his team to rescue Harley Quinn, who thwarted it by rescuing herself. Then there was some standard exposition to set up the basic story: namely, that the Suicide Squad members get the same deal as before: 10 years off their sentence if they successfully complete their mission, with a nanite injection that will explode should they disobey orders in any way.\n    The  second trailer, released on April Fool&#39;s Day, dispensed with the jokey tone and\u00a0running gags of King Shark&#39;s gruesome eating habits (&#34;num-num&#34;) in favor of a darker, more ominous tenor.\u00a0We got to see Polka-Dot Man in action, and TDK revealed a surprising ability to separate his arms from his body.\u00a0Bonus: we got a good look at the writing on the back of Harley Quinn&#39;s jacket: &#34;Live Fast Die Clown.&#34;\n This latest trailer falls somewhere between jokey and dark. It focuses more on Bloodsport, opening with him scrubbing floors in prison as Waller tries to recruit him for the squad. Waller uses Bloodsport&#39;s daughter&#39;s upcoming court case as leverage. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t take such extreme measures if this mission weren&#39;t more important that you could possibly imagine,&#34; Waller assures him. We also learn that Bloodsport is in prison because he put Superman in the ICU with the help of a kryptonite bullet, so he&#39;s got legit badass bona fides.\n In terms of new footage, we get an inter-squad debate over what kind of dog Weasel might be\u2014TDK guesses Afghan hound, Harley is hoping for werewolf\u2014with Flag assuring them Weasel is harmless.

We started to build a casual relationship then. Fast forward to 2016. At my first fund, Cross Culture [Ventures], we were interested in investing in early childhood care. We were actually looking at a number of different companies and one of my partners, Suzy [Ryoo] was like, \u2018Have you heard of this company Wonderschool that Chris Bennett was starting, and I was like, \u2018Holy shit, I know Chris.\u2019 \u201d\n According to Bennet, Nichols reached out about the opportunity on Facebook Messenger. After the initial conversation and assessing some direct competitors, Nichols says Wonderschool was ultimately the right fit for Cross Culture\u2019s portfolio.\n  \u201cI used to go the TED conference every year,\u201d says Bennett. \u201cI met a woman who told me that early childhood education was really important [ \u2026 ] She said, \u2018A lot of the skills I use today as a CEO, a lot of those seeds were planted before the age of five.\u2019 I thought that was a really wild idea. I started doing research and realized there was a shortage of childcare in America.\u201d\n Bennett cringed slightly when we started the process of showing off the company\u2019s early deck. The first thing that jumped out at all of us was just how bare bones the presentation is: white text on a blue background, largely made up of bullet points.

months and it is still not finished!\n Our marketing created the campaign page themselves, because it takes IT forever to setup anything!\n Sounds familiar? I have been on both ends of these conversations, but mostly on the \u201cbeing yelled at\u201d end. For a long time, I was puzzled. Why was this happening?\n  You have a reasonable development team. Certainly expensive enough for your CFO to give you hard time. Despite that, things are still moving at snail&#39;s pace, at least according to your business users. Stuff is coming out of your pipeline, sure, but many good ideas, which could even be quickly developed, are killed, because no-one wants to wait until next quarter to test a simple business hypothesis.\n Many organizations adapt agile development methodologies with high hopes of solving this very issue. Often that fails miserably. What those Scrum certified consultants fail to mention is that Scrum optimizes for short term predictability, rather than throughput. Maybe Scrum has too many meetings for you, so you pick Kanban. Or rather what you think is Kanban, though it probably is not Kanban, but a single pile of tasks and a Jira board with few columns to go along with it. Result is more or less the same in both cases.\n Few companies even choose to go back to waterfall project management, because that at least gives them the illusion of long term predictability. It can definitely promise more than agile can deliver.\n  Too late in my career have I discovered  Kingman&#39;s formula. The formula originally appeared in an ancient math paper by J. F. C. Kingman in 1960 named \u201c The single server queue in heavy traffic&#34;. (Mind you, the server mentioned here is an actual person serving someone)\n   where  \u03c4 is the mean service time (i.e.  \\( \u03bc=\\frac{{1}}{{\u03c4}} \\) is the service rate),  \u03bb is the mean arrival rate,  \\( \u03c1=\\frac{{\u03bb}}{{\u03bc}} \\) is the utilization,  c a is the coefficient of variation for arrivals (that is the standard deviation of arrival times divided by the mean arrival time) and  c s is the coefficient of variation for service times.\n Understood? No? OK. I did not get it either at first, so let me explain. This formula, from the field of queueing theory, puts into relation the queue length (or in other words, how long does it actually take in real world days to develop anything here) with the following variables:\n variability in task size (are the tasks similar in size or some are small and some really big?)\n  utilization (what is the ratio between the entity performing the task is idle versus busy)\n You don&#39;t need to understand it completely in order to learn from it. The important takeaways are, that all three of the above increase the queue length. But they do so in a peculiar way with regards to the utilization. Under about 85% utilization, the variability does play a role, but not that big. Even with high variability, the work flows smoothly. But above 85% utilization the graph of queue length seems to explode exponentially. It becomes extremely sensitive to the two variabilities and above 95% the queue length starts quickly approaching infinity. Or it definitely feels that way to your users. Just ask them.\n Because the effect of high utilization is so large, much bigger than the influence of the two variabilities, the formula can be simplified and approximated as\n  If you plot it in a graph, it looks something like this. The graph is borrowed from The DevOps Handbook. Just notice how the wait time really takes off after hitting 85% utilization.\n    The variability of arrival rate is difficult to influence, as the tasks often originate outside of your control. There are still things you can do. To the outside world, IT looks like a opaque box, where you insert the tasks on one end and (sometimes) features come out the other end. The actual process however often involves multiple teams where the work is handed over and mini-queues also exist. Try to avoid batching of tasks in these internal handovers for more smooth workflow. And try to reduce the number of handovers by integrating more roles into a single team or eliminate the stages ruthlessly. Do you really need all those approval columns?\n Also, try to avoid big management planning sessions, where the board locks itself in a mountain resort for the weekend and creates a list of high priority projects for the following quarter. That does not help.\n  Task size is something we can influence more directly. If you take one thing from agile, it&#39;s the concept of User stories. If done right, a single user story should provide some value to some users and be ready to deploy within the two-week sprint. That means it should be small enough and uniform enough to help reduce the variability.\n Slicing user stories is an art in itself and would probably do for a separate article, but I will leave you with just one idea, that should help:  Try to solve a problem completely for a single class of users, however small that class is, rather than partially solve a problem for everyone.\n  The most important, but actually probably the simplest to influence, is the utilization of the team.  Just plan less work and give your team some slack. But simple does not mean easy. It&#39;s very counterintuitive. \u201cWhat do you mean, plan less work? How is that going to speed things up?\u201d Well, because science says so!\n But if science and beautiful math formulas fail to convince, you can reach for an example everyone should be able to understand. The analogy is not perfect, but works pretty well. I am talking of course about  traffic jams on the highway. I assume you have been in few. Have you noticed, how when the number of cars on the highway starts to increase, the speed you are driving goes down a bit? And then, it reaches some kind of seemingly illogical point, where suddenly everything comes to a screeching halt, even when there is no apparent reason like an accident or closure?\n Remember how the traffic experts keep telling you: \u201cIf there is a lot of traffic, slow down and avoid switching lanes to avoid causing a traffic jam?\u201d Well, that&#39;s because with a lot of traffic, the road has a  high utilization (ie. less space between cars). By switching lanes you are increasing the  variability of arrival (each segment of each lane works actually as a separate queue). By going fast, you are unable to keep driving a same constant speed like everyone else and thus increase the  variability of the duration of the task. You are constantly speeding up and slowing down. The task in this case means \u201cmoving one meter forward\u201d. Under high utilization, even slight increase in either of the two variabilities or the utilization itself has a huge effect on the queue size. The result: traffic jam.\n   You have to slow down to go faster. It&#39;s as simple as that. Aim for below 85% utilization. Same as we do not run our servers at 100% utilization, we should not run our teams at 100% utilization. If you do, expect your queues to approach \u221e.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 06:03:03", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5371\u9669,kingman,\u4efb\u52a1", "title": "\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4f60\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5371\u9669 ", "title_en": "Ignore the Kingman at your own peril", "transed": 1, "url": "https://taborsky.cz/posts/2021/kingman-formula/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5371\u9669", "kingman", "\u4efb\u52a1"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f9e875478a46c0c63032e3ad14e54496.png", "infoid": 1067569, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters", "note_en": "This is an open access journal, and articles are distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 License, which allows others to remix, tweak, and build upon the work non-commercially, as long as appropriate credit is given and the new creations are licensed under the identical terms.\n  Saffron,  Crocus sativus (Iridaceae), is a perennial herb, which earned its popularity as both medicine and spice. It is an inhabitant of different mountainous regions of Asia Minor to Greece, Western Asia, Egypt, and India. The benefits of saffron as an antidepressant are well-documented. Almost 150 volatile and nonvolatile compounds are obtained from the chemical analysis of this plant. Fewer than 50 constituents elucidated and identified so far showed phytochemical characteristics. The major bioactive compounds identified are safranal, crocin, and picrocrocin, which are responsible for its aroma as well as its bitter taste. This review is an attempt to encompass the methods of analysis and pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of saffron followed by its efficacious and safe potential.\n Crocus sativus L. belonging to Iridaceae family, commonly known as saffron, is a perennial herb widely cultivated in Iran and other countries, such as India and Greece. Commercial saffron is a spice comprises of dried red stigma with a small portion of the yellowish style attached to the flower of  Crocus sativus L., in Chinese its known as Fan-Hong-Hua. From decades saffron was used in traditional Chinese medicines for its expectorant, aphrodisiac, and antispasmodic effects.[ ] Saffron can be planted from an altitude of sea level to almost 2000 m, but it is more preferably adapted to hill sides and mountain valleys, ranging in altitudes between 600 and 1700 m.[ 2] Also, this plant can be cultivated in a dry and infertile place where there is an extreme water shortage in summer. The origin of the word saffron is the French term \u201cSafran,\u201d which was derived from the Latin word \u201csafranum\u201d and yellowish in color, phytochemical analysis have revealed that the color is mainly because of the degraded carotenoid compounds, crocin and crocetin.[ ] This is one of the valuable herb in the world because it requires properly plucked stigma from the flowers. Variation and high quality of final products are due to the harvest process involved.[ ]\n Saffron has been famous as both medicine and spice in some cultures. The stigma of saffron has been used as a medicine over 3600 years ago.[ ] Saffron was used in various opioid preparations for pain relief (sixteenth to nineteenth centuries).[ ] Also, saffron has been used in coloring tunics in the region of Spain and by the Babylonian culture around 2400 BC.[ 7] This expensive spice can be found in different mountainous regions of Asia Minor to Greece, Western Asia, Egypt, or Kashmir.[ 7] Each of the flowers has three red-colored stigma, and one stigma of saffron weighs approximately 2 mg. Approximately 1 kg of this valuable spice is made from 150,000 flowers that must be carefully picked.[ ]\n One of the most established findings regarding the benefits of saffron is its antidepressant activity. There are clinical trials conducted, evaluating the efficacy of saffron in mild-to-moderate depression. The studies reported that saffron was more effective than placebo and at least equivalent to the therapeutic doses of imipramine and fluoxetine. One of the top five most predominant diseases worldwide is depression.[ ] Depression can affect the quality of life of someone because of the facts that it can cause a headache, difficulty in thinking, and loss of interest.\n Recently, approximately 150 volatile and nonvolatile compounds have been detected from the chemical analysis of  C. sativus L. However, fewer than 50 constituents have been identified so far as the phytochemicals of  C. sativus L. The major constituents of saffron are crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal.[ 9] The phytochemical agents in saffron are responsible for many pharmacological actions in the body. The phytochemical research has found that the color of saffron is mainly because of the degraded compound of carotenoids, which are crocin and crocetin.[ ] Many clinical studies focused more on the antidepressant effects of saffron.\n Saffron has intensive fragrant with slightly bitter taste and produces a bright yellow-orange solution when soaked in warm water.[ 10] Its stigma was shown to contain carbohydrates, minerals, mucilage, vitamins B1 and B2, and pigments. Crocin, crocetin, carotene, lycopene, and gigantic[ ] anthocyanin, alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and zeaxanthin are the oil-soluble pigments that can be found in the stigma.[ 12] The color of saffron is the result of degradation of carotenoid compounds named crocin. According to Wallis,[ 13] crocin constituent of saffron, which highly related to its intense color, is the natural water-soluble carotenoid. Crocetin in  C. sativus L. is a water-insoluble conjugated polyene with two carboxylic acid residues.[ 14] Crocetin esters or also known as crocin, which is hydrophilic and water soluble, are usually found in the saffron extract in which \u03b1-crocin, the glycosyl ester of crocetin, is the main contributor for the significant bright yellow-orange color of saffron.[ 15] Saffron has a unique flavor that is related mainly to the glycoside picrocrocin.[ 16] Picrocrocin is responsible for the unique flavor of  C. sativus L., which is found to be stable in fresh raw saffron and broken down when heated to release.[ ] Specific essential oils of the flower contribute to the sweet fragrance of saffron. The principal constituent of total essential oil of  C. sativus L., safranal is a carboxaldehyde volatile compound formed by deglucosylation of picrocrocin.[ 16] Saffron is widely used in food processing industry as colorant and flavoring agents. The essential oils also comprised several terpene aldehydes, ketones, and terpene derivatives (pinene and cineol).[ 10] The secondary metabolites present in the petals of  C. sativus L. are tannins, anthocyanins, and flavonoids, which include rutin, quercetin, luteolin, hesperidin, and bioflavonoids. Those compounds have been reported to have many pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory,[ ] antinociceptive,[ ] and blood pressure lowering effects.[ ]\n All  trans and  cis isomers of crocin reflect the characteristics of carotenoids by having ultraviolet (UV)-Vis spectra highlighting double peaks between 400 and 500 nm in the visible region.[ 21] Safranal is responsible for aroma, whereas its precursor picrocrocin, which is a monoterpene glycoside, is accountable for the bitter taste of saffron.[ 21] The pattern of UV absorption of picrocrocin can be seen with a broad band at 250 nm with the maximum absorption of 254 nm, reflecting the presence of an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated cycloaldehyde functional group in its molecular structure.[ 22] Picrocrocin underwent enzymatic or chemical hydrolysis to produce glucose and aglycone and then yielded safranal via dehydration during drying process.[ 22] Active components that indicate the quality and pharmacological studies of saffron are the enzymatic oxidative metabolites of glucoside derivative of zeaxanthin, which include  cis- and  trans-crocin, crocetin, picrocrocin, and safranal.[ 23] The main phytochemicals that may contribute to the biological activities of  C. sativus L. are crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal.\n Crocin and saffron extract had been revealed to prevent memory and spatial learning impairment because of chronic-induced stress.[ ] Prophylactic property of saffron against memory deficiency had been proposed to occur as the result of the correlation between the antioxidant activity of saffron and the impairment because of oxidative stress.[ 21] Akhondzadeh  et al.,[ ] in 2004, had shown saffron extract to be equally efficient to imipramine during double-blind and randomized trial conducted over 6 weeks. The dried saffron petal also had been revealed to be effective in mild-to-moderate depression based on 6 weeks of double-blind randomized clinical trials.[ ] Crocin (30 mg/day), the main antioxidant constituent of saffron stigmas, was shown to amplify the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in treating patients with mild-to-moderate depression with the absence of substantial side effects based on the observation of 4 weeks of randomized, double-blind, prospective, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial with 40 patients of major depressive disorder.[ ] Scientifically proven traditional uses of saffron as antidepressant suggested that crocin exerts its antidepressant effect by increasing cAMP response element binding protein, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor inducible levels in rat hippocampus.[ ] Subacute administration of crocin was indicated to cause antidepressant effects in the rat. When saffron capsules administered to patients with a prior history of percutaneous coronary intervention who had depression, it was found to be equally effective as fluoxetine.[ ] In one of the 6-week pilot double-blind, randomized trial, the petal of the  C. sativus L. was found to be equally valid with the stigma in the treatment of depressed outpatients.[ 30] The petal constituent of  C. sativus L., kaempferol, was revealed to have antidepressant effect when evaluated using forced swimming test in mice and rats.[ 31] It has been perceived that current findings of biological activities of  C. sativus L., particularly its main constituent crocin, supported its medicinal used in traditional practices.\n According to Murray and Lopez,[ ] depressive disorder is one of the most prevalent psychiatric diseases and has been estimated to affect up to 21% of the world\u2019s population. Majority of patients are often reluctant to take synthetic antidepressant drugs in their appropriate doses because of the anticipated side effects such as the inability to drive a car, dry mouth, constipation, and libido.[ ] Hence, plant extracts are some of the most attractive sources of new drugs and have been shown to produce a better result with low side effects in the treatment of depression.[ ]\n C. sativus L. or commonly known as saffron is an expensive traditional spice. Its active components have shown several useful pharmacological effects such as anticonvulsant, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, radical scavenger effects, and learning and memory-improving effects.[ ] Akhondzadeh  et al.[ 30] stated that saffron had been widely used to relieve stomachaches, ease the pain of kidney stones, and treat depression in Persian traditional medicine.\n According to Srivastava  et al.,[ ] two active ingredients of  C. sativus L., which are crocin and safranal, have shown antidepressant effects. This is in accordance to the study carried out by Hosseinzadeh  et al.,[ 35] regarding the effects of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of  C. sativus L. stigma and their constituents, safranal and crocin, for the antidepressant activity by using forced swimming test in mice. The result obtained shows that the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of stigma (0.2\u20130.8 g/kg), safranal (0.15\u20130.5 mL/kg), and crocin (50\u2013600 mg/kg) could reduce the immobility time of the mice and the swimming time increased greatly. It is suggested that the inhabitation of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin reuptake by crocin and safranal might be the possible mechanism of antidepressive effect of saffron.[ 30] Akhondzadeh  et al.[ ] also conducted a randomized trial to compare the efficacy of saffron with imipramine in the treatment of mild-to-moderate depression. In another study, patients were assigned to receive capsule saffron (30 mg/day) three times a day (tds) or capsule imipramine (100 mg/day tds) for a 6-week research.[ ] The result showed that saffron at this dose was found to be effective comparable to imipramine in the treatment of mild-to-moderate depression.\n Because the stigma of  C. sativus L. (saffron) is very expensive, the researchers use the leaves of this plant as it is cheaper and possesses antidepressant effect. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized trial performed by Srivastava  et al.,[ ] 40 patients were randomly assigned to receive a capsule of the petal of  C. sativus L. at dose of (30 mg/day) twice daily (bd) and capsule of placebo twice daily (bd) for a 6-week study. At 6 weeks, the petal of  C. sativus L. produced a significantly better outcome on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale than placebo. Hence, it is proven that the petal of  C. sativus L. does give antidepressant effect. Karimi  et al.[ 36] also conducted a study regarding the effects of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the stigma and petal of  C. sativus L. for the antidepressant activity according to the forced swimming test in mice. It was shown that both stigma and petal reduced immobility time of the mice. In a double-blind and randomized trial performed by Akhondzadeh Basti  et al.,[ ] patients were randomly assigned to receive a capsule of petal of  C. sativus L. (15 mg bid) (Group 1) and fluoxetine (10 mg bid) (Group 2) for an 8-week study. At the end of the trial, the petal of  C. sativus L. was found to be effective as similar to fluoxetine in the treatment of mild-to-moderate depression. In study by Melnyk  et al. (2010), kaempferol (the active constituent in saffron petals) at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg in mice and 50 mg/kg in rat reduces depressive symptoms similar to fluoxetine.[ 37] Wang  et al.[ ] also conducted research regarding the antidepressant properties of stigmas and corms of  C. sativus L. The corms of  C. sativus L. were fractionated based on polarity and yielded petroleum ether fraction and dichloromethane fraction. At doses of 150, 300, and 600 mg/kg, it showed significant antidepressant-like activities as the immobility time in the forced swimming test and tail suspending test was significantly reduced by these two fractions.\n Hausenblas  et al.[ ] stated that, similar to antidepressants, saffron may exert its antidepressant effect by modulating the levels of certain chemicals in the brain, including serotonin (a mood-elevating neurotransmitter). Although it has been proposed that saffron increases serotonin levels in the brain, the exact mechanism of action for this is unknown. More specifically, a saffron extract might inhibit serotonin reuptake in synapses. Inhibiting synaptic serotonin reuptake keeps serotonin in the brain longer, thereby enhancing its positive effects while combating depression.\n Several analytical methods have been developed for the systematic separation and quantification of saffron ( C. sativus L.) metabolites.[ ] Several methodologies have been reported using different analytical tools to analyze the bioactive constituents of saffron, that is, picrocrocin, safranal, and crocin.[ , 40, 41, 42, 43] UV-vis spectrometry method is recommended by the International Standardization Organization to characterize the quality of saffron. The technique has been used for quality and stability studies of saffron, whereby the process is considered to be appropriate for recognizing the taste, color, and flavor of the spice (ISO/TS 3632, 2003). However, this method is not suitable for the identification and quantification of each component of saffron extract. This is because the technique is not specific and cannot adequately separate. Hence, because of mentioned reasons, the advanced stationary phases of analytical and preparative methods have been developed such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gel column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, multilayer coil counter current chromatography with silica gel, aluminum oxide, and Sephadex LH-20.[ 41, 42, 44, ]\n Tarantilis  et al.[ ] and Tarantilis and Polissiou[ 43] in their studies reported other analytical methods such as reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) coupled together with mass spectrometry and photodiode array detector, and for the detection of volatile compounds, gas chromatography with mass spectrometer (MS).\n Most of the studies conducted have been focused on the analytical determination of the structure of crocin. However, the methods to isolate high-purity crocin have not been established.[ , 46] To obtain adequately pure crocin, the compound is first separated by chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 and then by preparative HPLC.[ 42] Through this method, crocin can only maximally be separated to seven fractions. The method also implies repeated procedures, which are time-consuming, before purified crocin can be isolated. A simple two-step method in which 20 fractions of crocin are separated simultaneously in the first step, and then high-purity pigment is obtained in a subsequent step has been reported by Zhang  et al.[ 46] The purity of the crocin compound was reported to be above 95%, whereby the methods used two-step, low-pressure liquid chromatography without preparative HPLC. Tarantilis and Polissiou[ 43] reported that isolation method namely micro-simultaneous steam distillation-solvent extraction and vacuum head space were more suitable to isolate the aroma components of saffron as compared to standard distillation method. Another method for the separation of crocin reported was crystallization, whereby the amount of obtained crocin from the first crystallization step was 17% of the stigma powder, but its purity was approximately 85%. The purity increased to more than 97% after a second crystallization step was performed. Therefore, the total amount of crocin obtained is 10% from the initial stigma powder of saffron.[ ]\n Other than the investigation of the biological activities of crocetin and crocin, it is also important to determine the pharmacokinetic aspects of the compounds such as its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion in the body. Until now, most of the studies were carried out using  in vitro and  in vivo animal model, which mainly focuses on the absorption and metabolism parameters. Also, the review of the pharmacokinetic profile of those compounds in human body remains inadequate. A study was conducted by Umigai  et al.[ ] on 10 healthy human volunteers with a single dose of crocetin orally administered at three doses (7.5, 15, and 22.5 mg) in the 1-week interval to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of plasma crocetin by using RP-HPLC. They reported that crocetin was rapidly absorbed and detected in the plasma within 1h and reached a peak of mean maximum plasma concentration, C max (100.9\u2013279.7 ng/ml) around 4\u20134.8 h. The C max value was also reported to be increasing in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, the mean elimination half-life of crocetin, T 1/2, in human plasma was also ranging from 6.1 to 7.5 h.[ ]\n In pharmacokinetic study, one of the factors affecting the bioavailability of a compound is its solubility and absorption through the gastrointestinal tract. The research carried out by Xi  et al.[ ] using HPLC observed that crocin remained undetected in the serum of tested rats, regardless of gender, following single or repeated doses of oral administration. However, its hydrolysis product, crocetin, was found in low concentration in the serum. Crocin also was excreted mainly in feces. Besides, following repeated oral doses of crocin, no accumulation of crocetin was found in the serum.[ ] This suggests that crocin is hydrolyzed in the intestine into crocetin before being absorbed into the bloodstream following oral administration. In detail, on the basis of  in vitro study, crocin was reported to get hydrolyzed into deglycosylated  trans-crocetin and subsequently, absorbed by passive transcellular diffusion to a high extent within short time interval through intestinal cells.[ ]\n However, a recent study by Zhang  et al.[ ] showed that orally administered crocin could be absorbed through gastrointestinal tract \n......", "posttime": "2021-06-23 06:02:28", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6297\u6291\u90c1,saffron,warning", "title": "\u85cf\u7ea2\u82b1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6297\u6291\u90c1\u836f ", "title_en": "Saffron as an Antidepressant", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6266642/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6297\u6291\u90c1", "saffron", "warning"]}]
