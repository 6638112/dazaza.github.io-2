They will also end EPA oversight of smog and emissions from pipelines and storage sites and lessen monitoring and reporting requirements for certain pollutants, the Journal reported.\n The new rules have most of the major elements of proposals from 2018 and 2019, according to the newspaper.\n  An EPA spokesperson told The Hill that the rule is \u201cstill under interagency review\u201d when asked for comment on the report.\n In 2019, the agency   proposed eliminating requirements  for oil and gas companies to install technology for monitoring methane emissions from pipelines, wells and facilities.\n In 2018, it proposed   reducing the frequency of monitoring methane emissions  of oil and gas wells to every two years and compressor stations that help transport natural gas to just once a year.\n  However, the Journal reported Monday that the administration would forgo the measures that would have reduced the inspection frequency due to difficulty in justifying them legally.\n The 2018 proposed rule also aimed to reduce qualifications for engineers that need to certify that emissions-capturing equipment is used and allow for more \u201calternative\u201d technologies to limit pollution, reduce emissions reporting requirements and exempt many natural gas processing plants from monitoring.\n Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that can be   25 times more impactful  than carbon dioxide in equal quantities. In 2018, it accounted for nearly 10 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions caused by human activity.", "posttime": "2020-08-11 08:28:02", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u73af\u4fdd\u7f72,rescind,\u6392\u653e", "title": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u73af\u4fdd\u7f72\u5c06\u64a4\u9500\u5bf9\u77f3\u6cb9\u548c\u5929\u7136\u6c14\u7684\u7532\u70f7\u89c4\u5b9a", "title_en": "EPA To Rescind Methane Regulations For Oil and Gas", "transed": 1, "url": "https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/511298-epa-to-issue-methane-rollback-this-week-report", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u73af\u4fdd\u7f72", "rescind", "\u6392\u653e"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e77108d04a7a0e824d867404245e7261.png", "infoid": 1017453, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6839\u636e\u5468\u4e00\u5206\u53d1\u7ed9\u64ad\u5ba2\u5236\u4f5c\u4eba\u7684\u4e00\u5c01\u673a\u5bc6\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u5c06\u628a\u514d\u8d39\u64ad\u5ba2\u7eb3\u5165\u5176\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u97f3\u4e50\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u4ea7\u54c1\u4e2d\u3002\n\u5468\u4e00\u670d\u52a1\u53f0\u770b\u5230\u7684\u8fd9\u5c01\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u79f0\uff0c\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u5f88\u5feb\u5c31\u4f1a\u5141\u8bb8\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u97f3\u4e50(Amazon Music)\u548c\u97f3\u9891(Audible)\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e24\u9879\u670d\u52a1\u8ba2\u9605\u3001\u4e0b\u8f7d\u548c\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u514d\u8d39\u64ad\u5ba2\u3002\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u97f3\u4e50\u7684\u514d\u8d39\u5c42\u548c\u4ed8\u8d39\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u7528\u6237\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u64ad\u5ba2\u3002\n\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u8054\u7cfb\u4e86\u9876\u7ea7\u64ad\u5ba2\u5236\u4f5c\u4eba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u97f3\u4e50\u548cAudible\u76845500\u4e07\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u529f\u80fd\u4e4b\u524d\u63d0\u4ea4\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u8282\u76ee\u63d0\u8981\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u6ca1\u6709\u900f\u9732\u8fd9\u9879\u529f\u80fd\u5c06\u4e8e\u4f55\u65f6\u63a8\u51fa\u3002\n\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u64ad\u5ba2\u6574\u5408\u5230\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u97f3\u4e50\u548cAudible\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u53ef\u80fd\u6700\u7ec8\u4f1a\u4e3a\u5176\u667a\u80fd\u626c\u58f0\u5668\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5e73\u53f0\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u751f\u7684\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u70b9\u64ad\u8282\u76ee\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u7684Echo\u626c\u58f0\u5668\u548cFire TV\u8bbe\u5907\u7cfb\u5217\u652f\u6301\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6765\u81eaStitcher\u3001TuneIn\u3001iHeart Radio\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u64ad\u5ba2\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "note_en": "Amazon will incorporate free podcasts into its Amazon Music and Audible products, according to a confidential email distributed to podcast producers on Monday.\n The email, seen by  The Desk on Monday, said Amazon would soon allow users of Amazon Music and Audible to subscribe, download and stream free podcasts using each service.

"note_en": "In 1948 there were seven thousand people in Grinnell, Iowa, including more than one who didn&#39;t dare take a drink in his own house without pulling the shades down first. It was against the law to sell liquor in Grinnell, but it was perfectly legal to drink it at home. So it wasn&#39;t that. It wasn&#39;t even that someone might look in through the window and disapprove. God knew Grinnell had more than its share of White Ribbon teetotalers, but by 1948 alcohol was hardly the mark of Cain it had once been. No, those timid souls with their fingers through the shade loops inside the white frame houses on Main Street and Park Street were thinking of something else altogether.\n They happened to live on land originally owned by the Congregational minister who had founded the town in 1854, Josiah Grinnell. Josiah Grinnell had sold off lots with covenants, in perpetuity, stating that anyone who allowed alcohol to be drunk on his property forfeited ownership.  In perpetuity! In perpetuity was forever, and 1948 was not even a hundred years later. In 1948 there were people walking around Grinnell who had known Josiah Grinnell personally. They were getting old; Grinnell had died in 1891; but they were still walking around. So... why take a chance!\n  The plain truth was, Grinnell had Middle West written all over it. It was squarely in the middle of Iowa&#39;s Midland corn belt, where people on the farms said &#34;crawdad&#34; instead of crayfish and &#34;barn lot&#34; instead of barnyard. Grinnell had been one of many Protestant religious communities established in the mid-nineteenth century after Iowa became a state and settlers from the East headed for the farmlands. The streets were lineal with white clapboard houses and elm trees, like a New England village. And today, in 1948, the hard-scrubbed Octagon Soap smell of nineteenth-century Protestantism still permeated the houses and Main Street as well. That was no small part of what people in the East thought of when they heard the term &#34;Middle West.&#34; For thirty years writers such as Sherwood Anderson, Sinclair Lewis, and Carl Van Vechten had been prompting the most delicious sniggers with their portraits of the churchy, narrow-minded Middle West. The Iowa painter Grant Wood was thinking of farms like the ones around Grinnell when he did his famous painting  American Gothic. Easterners recognized the grim, juiceless couple in Wood&#39;s picture right away. There were John Calvin&#39;s and John Knox&#39;s rectitude reigning in the sticks.\n In the fall of 1948 Harry Truman picked out Grinnell as one of the stops on his whistle-stop campaign tour, one of the hamlets where he could reach out to the little people, the average Americans of the heartland, the people untouched by the sophisticated opinion-makers of New York and Washington. Speaking from the rear platform of his railroad car, Truman said he would never forget Grinnell, because it was Grinnell College, the little Congregational academy over on Park Street, that had given him his first honorary degree. The President&#39;s fond recollection didn&#39;t cut much ice, as it turned out. The town had voted Republican in every presidential election since the first time Abraham Lincoln ran, in 1860, and wasn&#39;t about to change for Harry Truman.\n On the face of it, there you had Grinnell, Iowa, in 1948: a piece of mid-nineteenth-century American history frozen solid in the middle of the twentieth. It was one of the last towns in America that people back east would have figured to become the starting point of a bolt into the future that would create the very substructure, the electronic grid, of life in the year 2000 and beyond.\n    It was in the summer of 1948 that Grant Gale, a forty-five-year-old physics professor at Grinnell College, ran across an item in the newspaper concerning a former classmate of his at the University of Wisconsin named John Bardeen. Bardeen&#39;s father had been dean of medicine at Wisconsin, and Gale&#39;s wife Harriet&#39;s father had been dean of the engineering school, and so Bardeen and Harriet had grown up as fellow faculty brats, as the phrase went. Both Gale and Bardeen had majored in electrical engineering. Eventually Bardeen had taught physics at the University of Minnesota and had then left the academic world to work for Bell Laboratories, the telephone company&#39;s main research center, in Murray Hill, New Jersey. And now, according to the item, Bardeen and another engineer at Bell, Walter Brattain, had invented a novel little device they called a transistor.\n It was only an item, however; the invention of the transistor in 1948 did not create headlines. The transistor apparently performed the same function as the vacuum tube, which was an essential component of telephone relay systems and radios. Like the vacuum tube, the transistor could isolate a specific electrical signal, such as a radio wave, and amplify it. But the transistor did not require glass tubing, a vacuum, a plate, or a cathode. It was nothing more than two minute gold wires leading to a piece of processed germanium less than a sixteenth of an inch long, shaped like a tiny brick. Germanium, an element found in coal, was an insulator, not a conductor. But if the germanium was contaminated with impurities, it became a &#34;semiconductor.&#34; A vacuum tube was also a semiconductor; the vacuum itself, like the germanium, was an insulator. But as every owner of a portable radio knew, vacuum tubes drew a lot of current, required a warm-up interval before they would work, and then got very hot. A transistor eliminated all these problems and, on top of that, was about fifty times smaller than a vacuum tube.\n Bob had a certain way of listening and staring. He would lower his head slightly and look up with a gaze that seemed to be about one hundred amperes.\n So far, however, it was impossible to mass-produce transistors, partly because the gold wires had to be made by hand and attached by hand two thousandths of an inch apart. But that was the telephone company&#39;s problem. Grant Gale wasn&#39;t interested in any present or future applications of the transistor in terms of products. He hoped the transistor might offer a way to study the flow of electrons through a solid (the germanium), a subject physicists had speculated about for decades. He thought it would be terrific to get some transistors for his physics department at Grinnell. So he wrote to Bardeen at Bell Laboratories. Just to make sure his request didn&#39;t get lost in the shuffle, he also wrote to the president of Bell Laboratories, Oliver Buckley. Buckley was from Sloane, Iowa, and happened to be a Grinnell graduate. So by the fall of 1948 Gale had obtained two of the first transistors ever made, and he presented the first academic instruction in solid-state electronics available anywhere in the world, for the benefit of the eighteen students majoring in physics at Grinnell College.\n  One of Grant Gale&#39;s senior physics majors was a local boy named Robert Noyce, whom Gale had known for years. Bob and his brothers, Donald, Gaylord, and Ralph, lived just down Park Street and used to rake leaves, mow the lawn, baby-sit, and do other chores for the Gales. Lately Grant Gale had done more than his share of agonizing over Bob Noyce. Like his brothers, Bob was a bright student, but he had just been thrown out of school for a semester, and it had taken every bit of credit Gale had in the local favor bank, not only with other faculty members but also with the sheriff, to keep the boy from being expelled for good and stigmatized with a felony conviction.\n Bob Noyce&#39;s father, Ralph Sr., was a Congregational minister. Not only that, both of his grandfathers were Congregational ministers. But that hadn&#39;t helped at all. In an odd way, after the thing happened, the boy&#39;s clerical lineage had boomeranged on him. People were going around saying, &#34;Well, what do you expect from a preacher&#39;s son?&#34; It was as if people in Grinnell unconsciously agreed with Sherwood Anderson that underneath the righteousness the midwestern Protestant preachers urged upon them, and which they themselves professed to uphold, lived demons of weakness, perversion, and hypocrisy that would break loose sooner or later.\n No one denied that the Noyce boys were polite and proper in all outward appearances. They were all members of the Boy Scouts. They went to Sunday School and the main Sunday service at the First Congregational Church and were active in the church youth groups. They were pumped full of Congregationalism until it was spilling over. Their father, although a minister, was not the minister of the First Congregational Church. He was the associate superintendent of the Iowa Conference of Congregational Churches, whose headquarters were at the college. The original purpose of the college had been to provide a good academic Congregational education, and many of the graduates became teachers. The Conference was a coordinating council rather than a governing body, since a prime tenet of the Congregational Church, embedded in its name, was that each congregation was autonomous. Congregationalists rejected the very idea of a church hierarchy. A Congregational minister was not supposed to be a father or even a shepherd but, rather, a teacher. Each member of the congregation was supposed to internalize the moral precepts of the church and be his own priest dealing directly with God. So the job of secretary of the Iowa Conference of Congregational Churches was anything but a position of power. It didn&#39;t pay much either.\n The Noyces didn&#39;t own their own house. They lived in a two-story white clapboard house that was owned by the church at Park Street and Tenth Avenue, at the college. Not having your own house didn&#39;t carry the social onus in Grinnell that it did in the East. There was no upper crust in Grinnell. There were no top people who kept the social score in such matters. Congregationalists rejected the idea of a social hierarchy as fiercely as they did the idea of a religious hierarchy. The Congregationalists, like the Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, and United Brethren, were Dissenting Protestants. They were direct offshoots of the Separatists, who had split off from the Church of England in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and settled New England. At bottom, their doctrine of the autonomous congregation was derived from their hatred of the British system of class and status, with its endless gradations, topped off by the Court and the aristocracy. Even as late as 1948 the typical small town of the Middle West, like Grinnell, had nothing approaching a country club set. There were subtle differences in status in Grinnell, as in any other place, and it was better to be rich than poor, but there were only two obvious social ranks: those who were devout, educated, and hardworking, and those who weren&#39;t. Genteel poverty did not doom one socially in Grinnell. Ostentation did. The Noyce boys worked at odd jobs to earn their pocket money. That was socially correct as well as useful. To have devoted the same time to taking tennis lessons or riding lessons would have been a gaffe in Grinnell.\n Donald, the oldest of the four boys, had done brilliantly at the college and had just received his Ph.D. in chemistry at Columbia University and was about to join the faculty of the University of California at Berkeley. Gaylord, the second oldest, was teaching school in Turkey. Bob, who was a year younger than Gaylord, had done so well in science at Grinnell High School that Grant Gale had invited him to take the freshman physics course at the college during his high school senior year. He became one of Gale&#39;s star students and most tireless laboratory workers from that time on. Despite his apparent passion for the scientific grind, Bob Noyce turned out to be that much-vaunted creature, the well-rounded student. He was a trim, muscular boy, five feet eight, with thick dark brown hair, a strong jawline, and a long, broad nose that gave him a rugged appearance. He was the star diver on the college swimming team and won the Midwest Conference championship in 1947. He sang in choral groups, played the oboe, and was an actor with the college dramatic society. He also acted in a radio drama workshop at the college, along with his friend Peter Hackes and some others who were interested in broadcasting, and was the leading man in a soap opera that was broadcast over station WOI in Ames, Iowa.\n  Perhaps Bob Noyce was a bit too well rounded for local tastes. There were people who still remembered the business with the box kite back in 1941, when he was thirteen. It had been harmless, but it could have been a disaster. Bob had come across some plans for the building of a box kite, a kite that could carry a person aloft, in the magazine  Popular Science. So he and Gaylord made a frame of cross-braced pine and covered it with a bolt of muslin. They tried to get the thing up by running across a field and towing it with a rope, but that didn&#39;t work terribly well. Then they hauled it up on the roof of a barn, and Bob sat in the seat and Gaylord ran across the roof, pulling the kite, and Bob was lucky he didn&#39;t break his neck when he and the rig hit the ground. So then they tied it to the rear bumper of a neighbor&#39;s car. With the neighbor at the wheel, Bob rode the kite and managed to get about twelve feet off the ground and glide for thirty seconds or so and come down without wrecking himself or any citizen&#39;s house or livestock.\n Livestock ... yes. Livestock was a major capital asset in Grinnell, and livestock was at the heart of what happened in 1948. In May a group of Bob Noyce&#39;s friends in one of the dormitory houses at Grinnell decided to have a luau, and he was in on the planning. The Second World War had popularized the exotic ways of the South Pacific, so that in 1948 the luau was an up-to-the-minute social innovation. The centerpiece of a luau was a whole roasted suckling pig with an apple or a pineapple in its mouth. Bob Noyce, being strong and quick, was one of the two boys assigned to procure the pig. That night they sneaked onto a farm just outside of Grinnell and wrestled a twenty-five-pound suckling out of the pigpen and arrived back at the luau to great applause. Within a few hours the pig was crackling hot and had an apple in its mouth and looked good enough for seconds and thirds, which everybody helped himself to, and there was more applause. The next morning came the moral hangover. The two boys decided to go see the farmer, confess, and pay for the pig. They didn&#39;t quite understand how a college luau, starring his pig, would score on the laugh meter with a farmer in midland Iowa. In the state of Iowa, where the vast majority of people depended upon agriculture for a livelihood and upon Protestant morality for their standards, not even stealing a watermelon worth thirty-five cents was likely to be written off as a boyish prank. Stealing a pig was larceny. The farmer got the sheriff and insisted on bringing criminal charges.\n There was only so much that Ralph Noyce, the preacher with the preacher&#39;s son, could do. Grant Gale, on the other hand, was the calm, well-respected third party. He had two difficult tasks: to keep Bob out of jail and out of court and to keep the college administration from expelling him. There was never any hope at all of a mere slap on the wrist. The compromise Grant Gale helped work out\u2014a one-semester suspension\u2014was the best deal Bob could have hoped for realistically.\n The Night of the Luau Pig was quite a little scandal on the Grinnell Richter scale. So Gale was all the more impressed by the way Bob Noyce took it. The local deathray glowers never broke his confidence. All the Noyce boys had a profound and, to tell the truth, baffling confidence. Bob had a certain way of listening and staring. He would lower his head slightly and look up with a gaze that seemed to be about one hundred amperes. While he looked at you he never blinked and never swallowed. He absorbed everything you said and then answered very levelly in a soft baritone voice and often with a smile that showed off his terrific set of teeth. The stare, the voice, the smile\u2014it was all a bit like the movie persona of the most famous of all Grinnell College&#39;s alumni, Gary Cooper. With his strong face, his athlete&#39;s build, and the Gary Cooper manner, Bob Noyce projected what psychologists call the halo effect. People with the halo effect seem to know exactly what they&#39;re doing and, moreover, make you want to admire them for it. They make you see the halos over their heads.\n Years later people would naturally wonder where Bob Noyce got his confidence. Many came to the conclusion it was as much from his mother, Harriett Norton Noyce, as from his father. She was a latter-day version of the sort of strong-willed, intelligent, New England\u2013style woman who had made such a difference during Iowa&#39;s pioneer days a hundred years before. His mother and father, with the help of Rowland Cross, who taught mathematics at Grinnell, arranged for Bob to take a job in the actuarial department of Equitable Life in New York City for the summer. He stayed on at the job during the fall semester, then came back to Grinnell at Christmas and rejoined the senior class in January as the second semester began. Gale was impressed by the aplomb with which the prodigal returned. In his first three years Bob had accumulated so many extra credits, it would take him only this final semester to graduate. He resumed college life, including the extracurricular activities, without skipping a beat. But more than that, Gale was gratified by the way Bob became involved with the new experimental device that was absorbing so much of Gale&#39;s own time: the transistor.\n Noyce and his wife arrived in Palo Alto at six a.m. By noon he had signed a contract to buy a house. That afternoon he went to ask Shockley for a job, projected the halo, and got it.\n Bob was not the only physics major interested in the transistor, but he was the one who seemed most curious about where this novel mechanism might lead. He went off to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge, in the fall to begin his graduate work. When he brought up the subject of the transistor at MIT, even to faculty members, people just looked at him. Even those who had heard of it regarded it merely as a novelty fabricated by the telephone company. There was no course work involving transistors or the theory of solid-state electronics. His dissertation was a &#34;Photoelectric Study of Surface States on Insulators,&#34; which was at best merely background for solid-state electronics. In this area MIT was far behind Grinnell College. For a good four years Grant Gale remained one of the few people Bob Noyce could compare notes with in this new field.\n Well, it had been a close one! What if Grant Gale hadn&#39;t gone to school with John Bardeen, and what if Oliver Buckley hadn&#39;t been a Grinnell alumnus? And what if Gale hadn&#39;t bothered to get in touch with the two of them after he read the little squib about the transistor in the newspaper? What if he hadn&#39;t gone to bat for Bob Noyce after the Night of the Luau Pig and the boy had been thrown out of college and that had been that? After all, if Bob hadn&#39;t been able to finish at Grinnell, he probably never would have been introduced to the transistor. He certainly wouldn&#39;t have come across it at MIT in 1948. Given what Bob Noyce did over the next twenty years, one couldn&#39;t help but wonder about the fortuitous chain of events.\n Fortuitous ... well! How Josiah Grinnell, up on the plains of Heaven, must have laughed over that!\n  GRANT GALE WAS the first important physicist in Bob Noyce&#39;s career. The second was William Shockley.

"note_en": "I recently watched  Build an enterprise-grade service mesh with Traffic Director, featuring Stewart Reichling and Kelsey Hightower of GCP, and of course Google Cloud\u2019s  Traffic Director. Coming at this with a brain steeped in 5\u00bd years of AWS technology and culture was surprising in ways that seem worth sharing.\n Stewart presents the problem of a retail app\u2019s shopping-cart checkout code. Obviously, first you need to call a payment service. However it\u2019s implemented, this needs to be a synchronous call because you\u2019re not going to start any fulfillment work until you know the payment is OK.\n If you\u2019re a big-league operation, your payment processing needs to scale and is quite likely an external service you call out to. Which raises the questions of how you deploy and scale it, and how clients find it. Since this is GCP, both Kubernetes and a service fabric are assumed. I\u2019m not going to explain \u201cservice fabric\u201d here; if you need to know go and web-search some combination of Envoy and Istio and Linkerd.\n The first thing that surprised me was Stewart talking about the difficulty of scaling the payment service\u2019s load balancer, and it being yet another thing in the service to configure, bearing in mind that you need health checks, and might need to load-balance multiple services. Fair enough, I guess. Their solution was a client-local load balancer, embedded in sidecar code in the service mesh. Wow\u2026 in such an environment, everything I think I know about load-balancing issues is probably wrong. There seemed to be an implicit claim that client-side load balancing is a win, but I couldn\u2019t quite parse the argument. Counterintuitive! Need to dig into this.\n And the AWS voice in the back of my head is saying \u201cWhy don\u2019t you put your payments service behind API Gateway? Or ALB? Or maybe even make direct calls out to a Lambda function? (Or, obviously, their GCP equivalents.) They come with load-balancing and monitoring and error reporting built-in. And anyhow, you\u2019re probably going to need application-level canaries, whichever way you go.\u201d I worry a little bit about hiding the places where the networking happens, just like I worry about ORM hiding the SQL. Because you can\u2019t ignore either networking or SQL.\n  Traffic Director \u00b7 It\u2019s an interesting beast. It turns out that there\u2019s there\u2019s a set of APIs called \u201cxDS\u201d, originally from Envoy, nicely introduced in  The universal data plane API. They manage the kinds of things a sidecar provides: Endpoint discovery and routing, health checks, secrets, listeners. What Google has done is arrange for gRPC to support xDS for configuration, and it seems Traffic Director can configure and deploy your services using a combination of K8s with a service mesh, gRPC, and even on-prem stuff; plus pretty well anything that supports xDS. Which apparently includes Google Cloud Run.\n It does a lot of useful things. Things that are useful, at least, in the world where you build your distributed app by turning potentially any arbitrary API call into a proxied load-balanced monitored logged service, via the Service Fabric.\n Is this a good thing? Sometimes, I guess, otherwise people wouldn\u2019t be putting all this work into tooling and facilitation. When would you choose this approach to wiring services together, as opposed to consciously building more or less everything as a service with an endpoint, in the AWS style? I don\u2019t know. Hypothesis: You do this when you\u2019re already bought-in to Kubernetes, because in that context service fabric is the native integration idiom.\n I was particularly impressed by how you could set up \u201cglobal\u201d routing, which means load balancing against resources that run in multiple Google regions (which don\u2019t mean the same things as AWS regions or Azure regions). AWS would encourage you to use multiple AZ\u2019s to achieve this effect.\n Also there\u2019s a lot of support for automated-deployment operations, and I don\u2019t know if they extend the current GCP state of the art, but they looked decent.\n Finally, I once again taken aback when Stewart pointed out that with Traffic Directors, you don\u2019t have to screw around with iptables to get things working. I had no idea that was something people still had to do; if this makes that go away, that\u2019s gotta be a good thing.\n Kelsey makes it go \u00b7 Kelsey Hightower takes 14 of the video\u2019s 47 minutes to show how you can deploy a simple demo app on your laptop then, with the help of Traffic Director, on various combinations of virts and K8s resources and then Google Cloud Run. It\u2019s impressive, but as with most K8s demos, assumes that you\u2019ve everything up and running and configured because if you didn\u2019t it\u2019d take a galaxy-brain expert like Kelsey a couple of hours (probably?) to pull that together and someone like me who\u2019s mostly a K8s noob, who knows, but days probably.\n I dunno, I\u2019m in a minority here but damn, is that stuff ever complicated. The number of moving parts you have to have configured just right to get \u201cHello world\u201d happening is really super intimidating.\n But bear in mind it\u2019s perfectly possible that someone coming into AWS for the first time would find the configuration work there equally scary. To do something like this on on AWS you\u2019d spend (I think) less time doing the service configuration, but then you\u2019d have to get all the IAM roles and permissions wired up so that anything could talk to anything, which can get hairy fast. I noticed the GCP preso entirely omitted access-control issues. So, all in, I don\u2019t have evidence to claim \u201cWow, this would be simpler on AWS!\u201d \u2009\u2014\u2009just that the number of knobs and dials was intimidating.\n One thing made me gasp then laugh. Kelsey said \u201cfor the next step, you just have to put this in your Go imports, you don\u2019t have to use it or anything:\n   I was all \u201cWTF how can that do anything?\u201d but then a few minutes later he started wiring endpoint URIs into config files that began with  xdi: and oh, of course. Still, is there, a bit of a code smell happening or is that just me?\n  Anyhow \u00b7 If I were already doing a bunch of service-fabric stuff, I think that Traffic Director might meet some needs of today and could become really valuable when my app started getting heterogeneous and needed to talk to various sorts of things that aren\u2019t in the same service mesh.\n  What I missed \u00b7 Stewart\u2019s narrative stopped after the payment, and I\u2019d been waiting for the fulfillment part of the puzzle, because for that, synchronous APIs quite likely aren\u2019t what you want, event-driven and message-based asynchronous infrastructure would come into play. Which of course what I spent a lot of time working on recently. I wonder how that fits into the K8s/service-fabric landscape?", "posttime": "2020-08-11 07:59:40", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

studios to remove the Fox name from two of them.\n Nearly a year and a half after acquiring 20th Century Fox Television and Fox 21 TV Studios, Disney is changing the former to simply 20th Television, while the latter will become Touchstone Television. Additionally, ABC Studios and its subsidiary ABC Signature Studios are folding into one unit that will now be called ABC Signature. The full integration of the Disney Television Studios rebranding is effective immediately, with new logos and motion end cards that viewers will see on screen expected to be completed by year&#39;s end. No executive changes or layoffs are expected as part of the changes.\n The decision to remove &#34;Fox&#34; from two of the studios&#39; names was part of the larger $71.3 billion deal between Disney and 21st Century Fox. Fox was dropped from film divisions 20th Century and Searchlight in January.\n &#34;Our new studio names and logos mark a new day for ABC Signature, 20th Television and Touchstone Television while honoring their rich histories and the creative power of the Walt Disney Co. Dana [Walden] and I could not be more pleased with the first year of our three studios together as part of Disney Television Studios and we believe that with our powerhouse talent roster and exceptional studio teams, the best is yet to come,&#34; said Disney TV Studios president Craig Hunegs.\n Dropping the Fox 21 banner in favor of Touchstone revives the former Disney brand that was retired in 2007 as the division was then-rebranded as ABC TV Studios as part of the company&#39;s push to drop such lesser-known brands in favor of those leaning into its signature assets. Reviving Touchstone is a way to honor the past. The new ABC Signature will be overseen by president Jonnie Davis. Tracy Underwood, who added ABC Studios to her purview at ABC Signature, will continue to report to Davis. The blending of the two divisions was considered a logical next progression after Davis expanded Underwood&#39;s role to include both units. ABC Signature Studios was previously the cable and streaming arm of ABC Studios. With streaming a priority for every studio, the blending of the two units makes sense.\n Touchstone TV will be overseen by Fox 21&#39;s Bert Salke. Carolyn Cassidy will continue to lead 20th Television.", "posttime": "2020-08-11 07:33:41", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

"note_en": "On August 4, 2020, a massive explosion blasted deadly waves through  downtown Beirut. Then, video of the fireball rippled around the world almost as quickly. Now, details of the blast that started in a fireworks storage area by a small storage building at the end of a Beirut pier trickle in as the world waits to hear what the final death, injury, and destruction tallies will be. However, in a way, the world already has some idea what to expect, because similar blasts have occurred before.\n As a biomedical engineer with a doctorate in the patterns of injury and trauma that follow an explosion, scraping together information from accidental blasts is part of my daily work. The more mundane explosions are rarely this size, but the same principles of physics and chemistry apply. Science, along with a few case studies from history, let me do some preliminary calculations to puzzle out this explosion, too.\n In 1917, an accidental detonation of 6 million pounds of hodgepodge high explosives in the harbor of Halifax, Nova Scotia, left a  swath of wreckage that, at least until Tuesday, was the largest nonnuclear explosion ever created by humanity. As we learn more about Beirut, which could possibly challenge that record, the story of Halifax tells us what we might expect to learn about the ensuing trauma, and the modern cell phone videos, along with the blast physics gleaned by scientists in the intervening century, tell us why those patterns of trauma occurred in quite the way they did.\n  Every fire is a rearrangement of molecules, and an explosion is basically a fire turbocharged into a hyper-energy-fueled frenzy. Unstable structures barter and swap atoms with one another until all of them, happy with their trades, blissfully settle into more relaxed, lower-energy states, like rocks reaching the bottom of a hill. But their excess energy has to go somewhere. In a campfire, where the chemical reactions are facilitated in a leisurely way by the oxygen in the air alone, energy is released slowly as enjoyable levels of heat and light. In an explosion, however, the devilish little instigator that is oxygen shoves the process into overdrive.\n  Early reports of the blast revealed that the building that sparked the eruption may have been storing large quantities of ammonium nitrate, a flammable chemical that has relatively harmless manifestations as fertilizer but has also been experimented with as a rocket fuel. Oxygen is the key to ammonium nitrate\u2019s  deadly habit of exploding, and given that  47 known, major, accidental ammonium nitrate explosions have occured in the last century, it is undeniably a habit. \u201cAmmonium\u201d is a nitrogen atom with four hydrogens, written NH 4 +, whereas the \u201cnitrate\u201d part of the mix is a nitrogen with three oxygens, NO 3 -. Under boring everyday conditions, the  + of the ammonium and the  \u2013 of the nitrate pull the two molecules into a harmless hug, but when you add a spark\u2014or a firework\u2014the molecules realize that their very atoms can get a little friskier and convert into something completely new.\n  When ammonium nitrate is manufactured as fertilizer, it is mixed with other chemicals that usually  stop this reaction from happening, though as the 2013 explosion at the West Fertilizer Company proved, those chemicals are  not always successful. The first reports out of Beirut suggested fertilizer may have once again been the culprit. However,  photos shared on social media showed bags marked \u201cNitroprill HD\u201d supposedly being stored at the Beirut pier, and some have speculated that if those photos are accurate,  Nitroprill may be a knockoff of the name-brand blasting agent Nitropril. Nitropril is  designed for use in coal mines, so this particular breed of ammonium nitrate would not have been mixed with quieting chemicals like a fertilizer would be; rather, it would have been mixed to blow.\n  And nitrate, when mixed to blow, wants to ditch those little Os. It\u2019s chemically unstable, meaning the bonds between the Ns and the Os vibrate with an unhappy level of physical tension. Overloaded with three oxygens, NO 3 - is eager to shove some onto any neighbor, and with a little bit of heat to get things moving, it will do so willingly. NH 4 + is all too happy to accept.\n  The chemical rearrangement of ammonium nitrate answers a lot of the public questions about the videos, including the source of the startling red color of the plume. One of the byproducts of NO 3 - as it sheds all that oxygen is nitrogen dioxide, which has a logically obvious chemical structure of NO 2 and looks  deep, blood red. Many explosive materials give off tints and hues during a blast that suggest their chemical composition\u2014chemical additives to color both smoke and explosions have been around since  before the 1920s and are how we get different-colored fireworks and  signaling flares\u2014and it\u2019s nitrogen dioxide that gives an ammonium nitrate explosion its signature, ominous blood-like tone. A small blast can look subtle and orange-ish, but on a large scale like at Beirut, the sunlight helps deepen its hue.\n  According to Brad Wojtylak, a special agent bomb technician and certified explosive specialist with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, when smoke plumes are large enough, they begin to catch the sunlight, and refraction will darken the normal colors produced by any explosion. Wojtylak is not directly involved in the Beirut investigation but has 16 years of experience investigating blast accidents. He says as sunlight bounces around within the cloud of contaminants, other, less determined wavelengths get refracted off in different directions. When a smoke plume happens on such a large scale, only the longest wavelengths, the red shades, persevere all the way through to the viewer on the other side. So, the natural reddish color becomes even deeper, richer, darker than it would be for a small blast.\n An explosive with a pure burn, like any explosive used in military-grade weaponry, will produce smoke that looks equally pure: snowy, billowy white, or sometimes a pale grey. But accidental explosions are far less tidy, and their sloppy combustion also produces ash, particulates, and gross black charred contaminated matter. This black gunk billows into the sky along with the other byproducts, coloring the smoke plume, like the charcoal residue left behind after the more efficient parts of the campfire wood have burned away. To a blast expert, the videos, with their roiling cloud of black and red curling over the pier of Beirut, scream \u201cammonium nitrate.\u201d\n  The videos also show an unnervingly uniform hemisphere of white propagating outward from the blast site, a dome of vicious vapor that eventually hurtles toward every person filming and announces its arrival in the audio with a crash. This hemisphere is the pressure wave produced by the explosion.\n No, it\u2019s not a shock wave. It\u2019s a pressure wave, and that key difference affects the number of casualties expected. A shock wave goes from zero pressure to its absolute maximum pressure in literally zero seconds. The impact of a pressure wave is like hitting the ground after rolling down a steep cliff; the force of a shock wave is like hitting the ground after falling through the air and reaching terminal velocity. High explosives produce shock waves; low explosives, like ammonium nitrate, produce pressure waves, which have a bit of slope to their shape, a period of time over which the pressure increases more gradually.\n  Shocks, because of their fascinating and complex physics, travel faster than the speed of sound, and they cause far more damage than pressure waves. Thankfully, we know this blast did not produce a shock because the speed of the water-vapor-filled white dome can be measured.\n The speed of sound in air is 343 meters per second. Based on the viewing angle and distinctive red chairs pictured in some of the later frames,  I traced one of the Beirut videos posted by  The Guardian to its filming location on the rooftop terrace of  La Mezcaleria Rooftop Bar, and measured it to be 885 meters from the center of the blast. From that vantage, the pressure wave can be seen neatly traveling from the center of the blast first to the point halfway between the end of the pier and the edge of the long, massive gray grain silo building, a distance of 151 meters, then to the end of the pier, 262 meters, then eventually to La Mezcaleria.\n By measuring the times at which the pressure wave reaches these landmarks on the video, we know that, as it blazed down the pier, its rampage occurred at a speed of only 312 meters per second. That\u2019s slow for a bomb. Then by the time the audible crash and mayhem reached the formerly peaceful and picturesque outdoor bar, it had slowed to at most 289 meters per second. The pressure wave, slower than the 343 meters per second speed of sound, caused destruction, horror, confusion, shattered glass, torn-apart flat surfaces, and disorientation for onlookers as their ears were subjected to the rapid pressure fluctuations. But a shock wave could have caused them to  drop dead from lung trauma as they watched.\n In the  6 million-pound Halifax explosion of 1917, the propagation of the shock wave through downtown left a swath of fatalities reaching 1.5 miles from the center of the blast, killing an estimated 1,950 and leaving another 8,000 with devastating injuries. (The ships that exploded in the harbor were known to be carrying high explosives, which by their nature always make shock waves.) In Beirut, thankfully, while building damage has been reported up to  5.6 miles away, because the low-explosive ammonium nitrate made a pressure wave rather than a shock wave, the fatality estimates so far are still in the hundreds, even though the charge size was likely larger than the bomb in Halifax.\n  Thanks to modern technology that  charge size can be calculated scientifically too, even while waiting for more complete information to trickle out, using the size of the telltale crater. Analysis of the aerial photographs of the pier shows a crater in the range of 120 to  140 meters in diameter; blast physics mixed with history tell us that to carve a chunk that size from the side of the planet requires a charge equivalent to 1.7 to 5.4 million kilograms of TNT (that\u2019s 3.8 to 11.8 million pounds for any Americans dragging their feet on converting to metric). For reference, the bombing of the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 used the  equivalent of 1.8  thousand kilograms of TNT. So, Beirut was at minimum a thousand times more  boom than Oklahoma City.\n As an aside, nuclear weaponry is set to detonate several hundred feet above ground level, and therefore doesn\u2019t exert enough force directly on the soil to create a crater. The detonation of the first atomic weaponry above Hiroshima occurred almost exactly 75 years ago to the day, and despite its historically unprecedented trauma to the city and populace,  it left behind no crater.\n Sign up for our  Longreads newsletter for the best features, ideas, and investigations from WIRED.\n Germany, too, knows the destructive power of improperly stored ammonium nitrate, and an accident in that country reinforces the calculation of the charge size. In 1921, a fertilizer explosion in Oppau, Germany, carved a remarkably similar crater. At 120 meters in diameter, following the explosion of  4.1 million kilos of ammonium nitrate, the size of the Oppau crater supports the idea that the Beirut pier, which early reports said held only  2,750 metric tons\u20142.75 million kilograms\u2014may have held some number of millions more kilograms of charge. However even using only those 2,750 metric tons, Special Agent Wojtylak says his preliminary calculations indicate that those safe from all risk of carnage would have needed to be at least 15 kilometers from the Beirut pier.\n  Within that radius, the injuries from such a massive blast in a downtown location can be as varied as the victims who experience them, but a number of them are likely from glass and other flying projectiles. Flat, delicate, frangible, and installed in large sheets, glass is the perfect target for a blast wave of even minuscule magnitude; it shatters and flies easier than any other substance.\n In Halifax, the fire that eventually triggered the main explosion meant that citizens were already positioned at their windows to watch the excitement when the bomb detonated. As a result, of those wounded on that morning in 1917, injuries of shattered glass penetrating the eyes of onlookers were described as \u201c extraordinarily prevalent.\u201d The accident of the fireworks storage area and its alarming plume of smoke similarly guaranteed plenty of onlookers for Beirut. Without smoke drawing these witnesses, we would not have such ample cell phone footage, but there also might have been fewer injuries.\n  The Halifax explosion resulted in the same series of events that, according to Duke University Hospital emergency room physician Dan Buckland, still occurs in emergency rooms today after mass casualty incidents. Buckland treated casualties following a natural gas explosion in Durham, North Carolina, in 2019 which, while substantially smaller in size, occurred in a densely populated downtown area. The first wave of patients are those who were physically near emergency services, he says, those unlucky enough to get hurt but lucky enough to do it in close proximity to an ambulance. After that, the hospitals get flooded by \u201c walking wounded,\u201d those who are wounded enough to seek medical care but intact enough to transport themselves. The key to increasing the number of survivors, Buckland says, is getting the third wave of patients through the door, through the crowds of this second wave. The third wave is made up of those at the core of the site, too injured to walk, whom the emergency responders combing the wreckage medically prioritize next.\n After a blast in a civilian area, emergency responders aren\u2019t the only heroes. Just after 9 am on December 6, 1917, in Halifax, mustachioed 45-year-old train dispatcher  Vincent Coleman knew the lazy plume of smoke coming from the explosive-laden vessel in Halifax harbor was a terrifying portent of worse to come. But as the other dispatchers ran for their lives, Coleman realized the number of train passengers set to arrive at Halifax any moment, and so he stayed long enough to send one final telegram: \u201cHold up the train. Munitions ship on fire and making for Pier 6 ... Goodbye boys.\u201d Coleman died in the blast at 9:05, but his final message saved thousands, not just the passengers on the trains that were able to stop before entering the zone of destruction, but also the citizens already in Halifax: The telegram signal reached every operator in the surrounding region, and because of Coleman\u2019s quick thinking, every doctor who felt the earth rumble, up to 160 km away, had almost immediate access to news about what had happened. They  rushed in to help.\n Medical personnel dealt with as many of the first, second, and even third waves of injured patients as fast as humanly possible, some of them even creating makeshift treatment centers on trains. From Beirut too, will gradually emerge stories of heroism and savvy, along with the final accounting of lives lost. But in the meantime, between those who filmed the blast and the application of physics, we can prevent any escalation of conspiracy theories or misunderstandings. The explosion wasn\u2019t a military-grade bomb; it most certainly wasn\u2019t a nuclear one. It was, sadly, tragically, history repeating itself yet again: Explosives can be devastatingly lethal, and we should never underestimate their destructive fury.\n   \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Listen to  Get WIRED, our new podcast about how the future is realized.

Today, Amazon is rebranding the suite of video game-focused perks to match the naming convention of its other digital services, such as Prime Video and Prime Reading. The newly-named  Prime Gaming works the same way as before. It&#39;s bundled with Amazon Prime -- the company\u2019s all-encompassing subscription service that includes faster \u2018premium\u2019 deliveries -- and offers a bunch of digital goodies that are designed to entice gamers. These include a free channel subscription on Twitch (if you don\u2019t have Prime, these normally cost at least $5 per month), a smattering of games and items for popular titles such as  Apex Legends.\n Amazon hasn&#39;t said why it&#39;s rebranding Twitch Prime. We&#39;re guessing some Prime customers still aren&#39;t aware that Twitch Prime exists or comes with their membership. There might be some users, too, who play games but don&#39;t use Twitch and wrongly assume that the perks aren&#39;t relevant to them. In a press release, Amazon said that Prime Gaming &#34;brings more new content for more games than ever before,&#34; pointing to  the various SNK titles that have been offered to subscribers and the agreements it&#39;s secured with heavyweight publishers such as Riot Games and Roblox Corporation.\n  It&#39;s unclear, though, if Amazon has any plans to change the general mix of perks and freebies that are included in the bundle. The company is rumored to be working on  a streaming service similar to Stadia, Nvidia&#39;s Geforce Now and xCloud, which will soon be bundled with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscriptions. Amazon is a game publisher, too, though most of its efforts, including   The Grand Tour Game and   Crucible, have  failed to take off. Still, it&#39;s not hard to imagine an Amazon-owned subscription that combines Twitch perks, Stadia-style streaming, and various in-game items for its own software (the company is planning to launch  an MMORPG called  New World next year) and those released by third-party publishers.", "posttime": "2020-08-11 07:31:49", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

the structure as a passive microwave repeater, part of a Bell Atlantic 6 GHz radio link between Thurmont and Frederick, MD. The link has been decommissioned but the repeater was not removed, due to the expense involved.\n  The web page for the passive repeater has been moved to my Bell System web site; the URL is  http://long-lines.net/places-routes/Thurmont_repeater/index.html .\n    Headquartered at Andrews Air Force Base in Camp Springs, Maryland, this unit provides communications vital to national security.\n  The 789th operates the   &#34;Mystic Star&#34; or Special Air Missions Communications (SAMCOM) radio network, which keeps the President and other senior officials in contact while airborne.\n  In addition, the 789th manages the  GLOBAL radio network. In a nuclear war, GLOBAL would transmit Emergency Action Messages from the National Command Authority to the U.S. nuclear forces. In peacetime, GLOBAL carries a wide variety of defense communications.\n                                    Also known as Site R and The Rock, this little-known underground facility is home to the Alternate National Military Command Center.\n        These documents from the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, highly classified for more than 30 years, discuss a proposal for a nuclear-bomb-proof command post 3,500 feet (1,067 meters) underground, in the vicinity of the Pentagon.\n      Mention the name &#34;Western Union&#34; and it&#39;s likely that most people will think of telegrams and money transfers.\r\r Less well known is the role played by The Western Union Telegraph Company in providing communications for national security during the Cold War.\r As a pioneer in data transmission and microwave radio communications, Western Union built and operated networks which carried important defense traffic.\n  Former employees of Western Union may wish to join  The Retired Western Union Employees Association.\n  The   Western Union Alumni web site offers historical information about the company,\rits technology and its services. Former employees are invited to register, and to share their knowledge and recollections.\n  The archives of the Western Union Telegraph Company are available for research at the Archives Center of the National Museum of American History in Washington, DC.\rThe Center&#39;s archivists have created a  description and finding aids for the collection.\n  Western Union supported at least two defense communications networks in the nation&#39;s capital area:\rthe  Washington Area Wideband System (WAWS), and the Automatic Digital Network (AUTODIN).\rAs its name implies, WAWS was limited to the Washington DC area; it linked various defense and intelligence-community facilities.\rAUTODIN was far more extensive, providing record communications service to military installations around the world.\n   The Western Union microwave network consisted of a chain of stations which reaching east and west across much of the country, with several branches going north and south.\n  Map of the Washington-Pittsburgh-New York City microwave routes (Oct. 22, 1957)   This &#34;radio triangle&#34; was America&#39;s first commercial microwave network, placed in service in 1947.

"note_en": "Based purely on economics, there should be a lot more solar panels on roofs in the United States. With the dramatic plunge in the price of panels, solar systems have become competitive with the cost of electricity in a growing number of states, leaving the question of sun exposure to be the primary driver of whether adoption makes sense. Yet photovoltaic-equipped houses remain a rarity in the US, despite many states pushing for the adoption of renewable energy.\n So why isn&#39;t that push working? To try to find out, a small team of researchers worked with a non-profit that promotes solar installs, helping test out two different message. One message focused on self-interest and emphasized the economic benefits of installing panels. The other was what&#39;s termed &#34;pro-social,&#34; meaning it emphasized that installation of solar would bring benefits to the community. As the researchers found, self-interest was king\u2014even after the promotion was over. But self-interest did have a side benefit in that the systems that were installed tended to get the most energy out of their panels.\n  The work relies on a program called Solarize. Solarize runs town-level programs that include a single installer that provides the entire town with a group rate. Program ambassadors also run pro-solar programs within the town, encouraging adoption. These programs were the ones targeted by the researchers, who arranged an experiment based on the message delivered by these ambassadors. Some towns received messages that focused on self-interest, like \u201csave thousands by installing solar.\u201d Others were more community-focused\u2014\u201cOur community is doing something together to have more clean energy,\u201d for example. The researchers worked with the program in Connecticut (one of the researchers is at Yale), which has expensive electricity.\n Previous surveys of Solarize participants suggest that either message could resonate. Of the top three reasons people were in the program, two involve economics (cheap pricing and saving on utility bills), and the other was concern for the environment.\n To turn this into an experiment, the researchers identified sets of three towns that were roughly matched demographically. Those towns were then split up so that one received a self-interested message, another received the pro-social message, and one didn&#39;t participate in the Solarize program. Due to some financial glitches, one of the planned programs didn&#39;t occur, leaving the experiment done with 29 towns and a total of just under 700,000 people participating. Data on existing trends and households were obtained by using Connecticut data on all state solar installs, as well as US Census Bureau data. Participants also received follow-up surveys.\n Overall, the Solarize program was effective, driving more installations than occurred in the control communities, as well as higher than the prior trends in the towns that participated. And, during the campaign, the self-interest messaging resulted in higher total installs than occurred in the towns that received pro-social messaging. While towns that received pro-social messaging did see a higher rate of install than control towns, the difference wasn&#39;t statistically significant.\n  In addition, the self-interest messaging resulted in more productive installs. Using Google&#39;s solar calculator, the authors estimate that the panels installed in response to these messages receive more sunlight on an average day, producing an extra 4.4 megawatt-hours over the lifetime of a typical system. That&#39;s consistent with the fact that the people who had received the self-interested messaging reported money as their foremost reason for installing solar. In addition, they were more likely to pay for their systems upfront, rather than taking loans, which increased the rate of return for the purchase.\n Not surprisingly, this sort of message also worked better in high-income communities. There&#39;s some hints that pro-social messaging worked better in low-income communities, but the results weren&#39;t statistically significant. The one thing that was consistently true for those who received the pro-social message is that they reported they were more satisfied with their installs and more likely to recommend solar to their friends and neighbors.\n Overall, the researchers suggest that there&#39;s no one-size-fits-all message that is likely to induce people to install solar power. For those with the means to pay for installations upfront, appealing to financial interest appears to be the way to go. Meanwhile, the community-focused messaging may draw in consumers who may not be in the strongest financial position but are primarily motivated by environmental concerns\u2014and are willing to install panels in less productive locations.\n The value of getting the message right isn&#39;t restricted to the campaign itself.

A new California law codified stricter requirements before companies can classify workers as contractors.\n The companies are also behind a California ballot measure that would keep drivers as contractors and provide them with some benefits.\n The new ruling, which comes in response to a  request from California&#39;s attorney general, gives the companies 10 days to appeal the decision before it goes into effect. They hope to use that appeal to get a longer stay on the ruling.\n  &#34;The court\u2019s ruling is stayed for a minimum of 10 days, and we plan to file an\u00a0immediate emergency appeal on behalf of California drivers. The vast majority of drivers want to work independently, and we\u2019ve already made  significant changes to our app to ensure that remains the case under California law. When over 3 million Californians are without a job, our elected leaders should be focused on creating work, not trying to shut down an entire industry during an economic depression.&#34;\n \u2014 Uber spokesperson  &#34;Drivers do not want to be employees, full stop. We\u2019ll immediately appeal this ruling and continue to fight for their independence. Ultimately, we believe this issue will be decided by California voters and that they will side with drivers.&#34;\n \u2014 Lyft spokesperson", "posttime": "2020-08-11 07:05:57", "source_domain":

"note_en": "Across California\u2019s Central Valley, hundreds of thousands of workers wash the vegetables, debone the meat, sort the nuts and package the produce that finds its way into kitchens throughout the United States.\n When the coronavirus hit, their work was ruled essential, so they kept working in the often cramped facilities that fuel a state industry that exports  $21bn in agricultural products each year.\n Workers told the Guardian that in the past months, as much of  California sheltered at home, they took their places at the production lines and sorting tables, against all social distancing guidelines, as their companies made excuses for why coworker after coworker stopped showing up for their shifts. Some workers said they had to learn from news reports that they had been exposed to Covid-19. Others said they felt obligated to work even when showing virus symptoms.\n Then they returned to their homes in cities across the region, unknowingly exposing their parents, their spouses, their children, aunts, uncles and cousins to the virus.\n  \u201cWe felt like they would tell us. They would take precautions. But they didn\u2019t,\u201d said Marielos Cisneros of her former employer, the nut producer Primex Farms, when the pandemic began. \u201cIn a sense, we felt secure.\u201d\n Now the virus is surging in the Central Valley, with several reported deaths among essential workers. In 10 counties, state authorities list workplaces and businesses as likely drivers for increased transmission. In at least two more counties, outbreaks in several food processing facilities have led to hundreds of infections.\n Workers and workers\u2019 rights organizations say these outbreaks and the subsequent swell of infections in the Central Valley point to a devastating truth: that we are each only as protected as our least protected; as vulnerable as our most vulnerable.\n \u201cYou can appear to contain the spread among middle-class workers but when it reaches those workers who are furthest on the margins, who are most disadvantaged, the virus is going to spread,\u201d said Edward Flores, a sociology professor at the University of California, Merced.\n  The Central Valley runs 450 miles down the center of California, much of it flat fields, lush fruit trees and vibrant orchards. The region contains the largest concentration of dairies in the state, as well as a number of meat-processing centers, together with the farms forming an agricultural juggernaut. In the San Joaquin Valley alone \u2013 the southern bulk of the region \u2013 more than 173,000 work in agriculture, with 45,000 more in food manufacturing, 60,600 more in grocery retail and 86,000 in transportation and warehousing, according to UC Merced\u2019s Community and Labor Center.\n In the eight counties of the San Joaquin Valley, a 27,000-square-mile area of 4.3 million residents, coronavirus cases are at 1,900 per 100,000 residents. In comparison, the San Francisco Bay Area, with 7.7 million residents in 7,000 square miles, has 770 cases per 100,000 residents.\n  From the beginning of the pandemic, advocacy groups expressed concern for  the safety of essential food workers. Much of this work does not allow for social distancing, with workers squeezing next to each other in fields and crowding together at the plants. Many who do the low-wage labor that keeps these industries afloat are Latinx and do not speak English, making it difficult for them to communicate with their employers and understand their rights. Some are undocumented, with the fear of deportation preventing them from coming forward with any grievances.\n Still, over the past five years, the federal and state occupational safety and health division has received more complaints out of the Central Valley and inspected more accidents in this region than anywhere else in the state, according to Ana Padilla, executive director of UC Merced\u2019s Community and Labor Center. The San Joaquin Valley has 13% of the state\u2019s meat-processing centers, but has received 49% of the state\u2019s inspections, Padilla said.\n Roxana Alvarado, 30, worked at Primex Farms in Wasco up until a few weeks ago. When she tested positive for the virus in June, dozens of her coworkers had already been infected, according to the workers and the United Farm Workers of America (UFW).\n At least 151 Primex workers have tested positive for Covid-19, according to the company \u2013 more than a third of the plant\u2019s staff. UFW, which is keeping a census of infected workers, said the first confirmed infected worker, whom the company has blamed for bringing the virus  into the facility from abroad and fired, last worked on 20 May.\n Workers said management held a meeting when the pandemic first took off, warning them not to travel or put themselves at higher risk for infection, but gave out little other information. Before the outbreak, they offered no testing and told the workers they could bring masks from home if they wanted but that they weren\u2019t mandatory. They made little effort to create social distancing. \u201cIn a typical day, an eight-hour shift, I can be in contact with 100 or more people, walking between people, going around the floor, chatting with people without masks,\u201d said Alvarado.\n Alvarado had worked at Primex for almost two years, cleaning both the facility and the produce. When people stopped showing up for their shifts, management would say they were on vacation, Alvarado said. On 23 June, the company admitted that it had 31 confirmed cases \u2013 although UFW says the real number of infections around that time was closer to 76.\n By then, Alvarado had brought the virus home to Bakersfield, where she lived with her husband and two children. Her five-month-old baby tested positive.\n \u201cThey took away my right to choose whether to expose my family and myself to Covid when they didn\u2019t inform us what was going on,\u201d Alvarado said. \u201cIf I had known there was Covid, I would have made the difficult decision to not go to work because I never would have put my family at risk.\u201d\n  Marielos Cisneros, 40, had worked as a sorter and then a production clerk for Primex for almost three years when she contracted a fever and went to the hospital on 10 June. She made sure human resources knew. \u201cWhen I told them that I was positive, the HR lady told me not to tell anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cShe told me to say I had a headache, that I had anything else but Covid.\u201d Primex denies the allegation.\n  All four of her children got coronavirus, including a son with asthma, Cisneros said. As a single mother dependent on one paycheck, she said she would have gone to work regardless, but she would have taken more precautions had she known how prevalent the virus was at the facility.\n Flores and Padilla, the researchers at UC Merced,  authored a study looking into the connection between low-wage work and the spread of Covid-19. They found that most counties in California with high worker distress were on the state\u2019s coronavirus watchlist, including much of the Central Valley.\n The disadvantages of this region and its workforce put them at higher risk not just for exposure to the virus, but also for unsanitary and unsafe work conditions with little freedom to advocate for themselves, Padilla said. More than 21% of workers in the region live below the poverty line and 17.9% are dependent on food stamps, according to the researchers. The region\u2019s immigrants have the lowest rate of naturalization in the state. Most workers don\u2019t qualify for federally guaranteed emergency leave, and if they are undocumented, they do not qualify for unemployment. From these tenuous circumstances, they go on to live in households that rank as the largest in the state.\n \u201cOne lady told me that she got infected, went home and unfortunately her entire family of 16 others was there,\u201d said Armando Elenes, UFW\u2019s secretary-treasurer. \u201cI\u2019m talking her husband, her sons, her son\u2019s wife, their kids. It went from her to 16 others.\u201d\n So far, 49 adult family members of the workers at the Primex plant and 34 children have tested positive, Elenes said.\n Jesse Rojas, a Primex spokesman, said the allegations by workers and UFW were \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201chearsay\u201d.\n  \u201cThe overwhelming majority of current and actual Primex employees are upset over UFW\u2019s lies and feel entirely safe going to work, as the company has gone above and beyond to ensure their safety,\u201d he said. He added  that Primex \u201chas been adhering to and following guidelines and recommendations by each institution at every level from the very beginning of the pandemic\u201d, but he declined to provide details of what those guidelines were and the dates that the company put them in place.\n  About 60 miles north in Kings county, another outbreak swept through Central Valley Meat Co, a slaughterhouse and beef-packaging plant. Attorneys representing workers in a class-action lawsuit against the company assert that the virus arrived at the facility in Hanford in April, eventually spreading to about 200 workers.\n At one point, in early May, Kings county reported that it had 158 coronavirus cases while Central Valley Meat Co reported internally that it had 161 cases, according to the lawsuit \u2013 more than 100% of the county\u2019s total cases. \u201cIt is beyond peradventure that Central Valley Meat is responsible for the significant increase in COVID-19 cases in Kings county,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n  The company did not put in place good social distancing guidelines, hand sanitizing stations or offer face masks until an outbreak was in full swing, according to workers and the lawsuit. Now, so many of the workers have gotten coronavirus that they\u2019ve given up on following any guidelines, said a former deboner who asked to only be identified as Martin out of fear of losing his job. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the virus has passed because everyone has tested positive,\u201d he said.\n The first person infected stopped coming to work in April, and when workers asked why, management told them he had an earache, Martin, 31,  said. It wasn\u2019t until that person\u2019s brother, who lived with him and also worked at the plant, tested positive and told their coworkers that they realized coronavirus had arrived.\n When Maria Pilar Ornelas, the lawsuit\u2019s main plaintiff, began struggling to breathe at work on 23 April, she asked management if she could get tested, according to the lawsuit. They told her testing was only offered to employees \u201cchosen by the company\u201d, the suit said, and told her she had to finish her shift, even though she had a headache so severe that her vision became blurry. She soon developed a fever of 103.7F.\n Ornelas eventually paid $225 for a test because the company does not provide health insurance, the lawsuit  said. By then, she had unknowingly spread the virus to her boyfriend.\n Martin, who has worked for the company for six years, tested positive in late April, along with another relative who lived with him. While Martin\u2019s wife and two children did not display symptoms during their 14-day quarantine, the wife and child of Martin\u2019s relative tested positive.\n Martin said some of his coworkers kept working despite displaying symptoms because they were afraid to lose their jobs if they stopped. Other coworkers stopped coming into work because they were scared of getting infected, he said \u2013 enough that in May and June, the company paid workers a bonus to risk their health and come to work.\n \u201cI felt like I was being bought out,\u201d Martin said. \u201cIt felt like they were trying to buy my life for an extra $100 a week.\u201d\n  Last month, California officials indicated that combating the spread in the Central Valley must be a priority. The governor, Gavin Newsom, announced that he was dedicating $52m to expand contact tracing, quarantine efforts and investigations in eight counties.\n Newsom has been upfront that coronavirus has harmed parts of California\u2019s population and economy in disproportionate ways. In particular, the Latinx community and low-wage essential labor workforce have borne the brunt of the burden, with the recent rise in cases in the Central Valley making the differences strikingly clear.\n  Padilla and Flores of UC Merced say that only more stringent policies and enforcement around workplace conditions will curb the crisis. Workplace safety and health concerns existed before Covid-19, they argue. Now, with the threat of a virus all around, the risks are potentially fatal.\n Maria Hortencia Lopez, a 57-year-old Primex employee, died of Covid on 14 July. Another worker who tested positive was taken off life support last month and is not expected to survive. Pedro Zuniga, a 52-year-old produce handler at a Safeway distribution center in Tracy, died weeks after coworkers began displaying symptoms at the center. Management told the sick employees that they had to keep working, according to a lawsuit filed by Zuniga\u2019s widow. Fifty-one workers eventually tested positive.\n Teena Massingill, a spokeswoman for Albertsons Companies, which owns Safeway, said the state occupational safety and health division inspected the Tracy distribution center on 15 April \u2013 two days after Zuniga\u2019s death \u2013 \u201cand no violations were found\u201d. \u201cPrior to Mr. Zuniga falling ill, the Company had instituted enhanced cleaning practices and social distancing protocols at the facility, and was implementing health screening and temperature checks,\u201d she said.\n At Primex, employees went on strike on 25 June and 6 July to demand the company adhere to federal law that requires employers like Primex to provide paid leave for specified reasons related to Covid-19 for up to 80 hours. Workers at the company struggled to get their full 80 hours paid, workers and UFW said. Cisneros said Primex told her it counted as vacation time.\n (@UFWupdates) Primex workers demand the company take action to protect them from COVID19 and treat them as the essential workers they are. / Trabajadores exigen que la compa\u00f1\u00eda tome accion para protegerlos del COVID19 y que los traten como como los trabajadores esenciales que son. #WeFeedYou  pic.twitter.com/6Byq7Iuatd\n After the strike, workers received their 80 hours, but then Primex laid off 40 employees, including, according to workers, Alvarado and some of the most outspoken when it came to the virus. Primex said the cuts were necessary because of production needs. Soon afterwards, it began hiring new workers. Rojas, the Primex spokesperson, said the company \u201chas always paid the state COVID-19 80-hour sick pay\u201d and that \u201cthe company has never retaliated against any employee\u201d. He added: \u201cAll of the changes in personnel are typical changes during the season.\u201d\n Marielos Cisneros felt that she was being bullied by management after she participated in the strike. She also still didn\u2019t feel safe in the facility, so she quit a week ago.\n She knows that the work they do is essential. She only wishes they were treated as such.\n \u201cTo them, we\u2019re just workers,\u201d Cisneros said. \u201cThey replace us really fast.

Lyft\u2019s   stock is down a sharper 2.1%, though its shares rose during regular trading, making the impact of its after-hours declines smaller in aggregate.\n As TechCrunch noted in its  coverage of the ruling, the costs associated with classifying current drivers as employees and not independent contractors could prove material. While the decision might be meaningful, investors seemed unmoved. Reading the Wall Street tea leaves can be an exercise in futility, but in this case the months of chatter and legal wrangling over the central question of whether drivers should be employees may have desensitized investors to any particular news item.\n  Both companies provided statements after the news broke, each stating that they will appeal the ruling. That legal posture could also help assuage investor concerns about short-term economic impacts regarding the injunction, which is currently set to take effect in ten days.\n  \u201cDrivers do not want to be employees, full stop. We\u2019ll immediately appeal this ruling and continue to fight for their independence. Ultimately, we believe this issue will be decided by California voters and that they will side with drivers.\u201d\n  \u201cThe court\u2019s ruling is stayed for a minimum of 10 days, and we plan to file an immediate emergency appeal on behalf of California drivers. The vast majority of drivers want to work independently, and we\u2019ve already made significant changes to our app to ensure that remains the case under California law. When over 3 million Californians are without a job, our elected leaders should be focused on creating work, not trying to shut down an entire industry during an economic depression.\u201d\n Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi  published an op-ed in the New York Times today ahead of the ruling, arguing for a middle ground between the gig economy of today\u2019s lack of worker support, and full employment.\n To understand why shares of Uber and Lyft are not taking more fire from public investors in light of the news, TechCrunch turned to the Uber\u2019s most recent earnings filings. Lyft does not report Q2 earnings until this Wednesday meaning we have less recent material from the company. Uber\u2019s documents, however, are useful.\n  Uber reported earnings last week,  showing stiff losses and a  surging food-delivery business. The company\u2019s ride-hailing operation was severely hampered by COVID-19 and its related impacts.\n As part of its earnings cycle, Uber  filed a 10-Q document. It included notes regarding the California legal situation from before the recent decision. The filing is dated August 7, 2020, or last Friday, making it about as fresh a comment from the company that we can expect regarding its pre-news perspective on the matter.\n Here\u2019s the first pertinent portion of its SEC filing, with our emphasis to help you parse it:\n The Company has existing litigation, including class actions, PAGA lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative and audit proceedings, asserting claims by or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors. In connection with the enactment of California State Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), the Company has received and expects to continue to receive \u2013 in California and in other jurisdictions \u2013 an increased number of misclassification claims.  With respect to the Company\u2019s outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on its current knowledge, the Company believes that the ultimate amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.  If one or more of these matters were resolved against the Company for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\n A bit further down in the filing, Uber said the following, regarding its chances of success:\n On August 6, 2020, following a hearing on the matter, the San Francisco Superior Court informed the parties that the Court would take the motions under submission and publish its order in the coming days.\n The Company intends to vigorously defend itself with regard to these actions. The Company\u2019s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.\n  Using their share price movement as a barometer, the immediate view from investors appears to be that the possible damage to Uber and Lyft from the decision could prove modest despite.\n Uber and Lyft had  made profit promises to their shareholders before COVID-19 arose, harming their business results. The California decision could add another layer of difficulty for each as they work to come out of the COVID area solvent, and once again on a path to adjusted profitability.", "posttime": "2020-08-11

\u201cnever stopped coding\u201d and what he sees changing in tech.\n \u201cWe try to not be too smart, because great founders often see things beyond what you\u2019re seeing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you try to be too smart, you\u2019ll miss the Airbnbs of the world. You\u2019ll say \u2018Airbeds in peoples houses? That\u2019s stupid! I\u2019m not going to invest in that,\u2019 and you could\u2019ve bought 10% of Airbnb for like nothing back then\u2026 10% of that company\u2026 you can do your own math.\u201d\n  Extra Crunch Live is our new virtual event series where we sit down with some of the top founders, investors and builders in tech to glean every bit of insight they care to share. We\u2019ve recently been joined by folks like  Hunter Walk,  Kirsten Green\u00a0and  Mark Cuban.\n To watch the entire interview with  Geoff Ralston,    sign up for ExtraCrunch \u2014 but once you\u2019ve got that covered, you can find it (and a bunch of key excerpts from the chat!) below.\n   I prefer it when an Extra Crunch Live conversation starts out with actionable advice, so we kicked things off with any suggestions Ralston had for folks looking to apply to YC. And he had plenty! Such as:\n Mind the deadline, but all hope is not lost if you miss it: \u201cIf you miss the deadline, it\u2019s not the end of the world,\u201d says Ralston. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone on the admissions team that I said this, but it\u2019s a  little bit of a soft deadline. We would never turn down the next epic company because you missed the deadline\u2026 although your odds go down of getting in if you don\u2019t make it in by [the deadline]. Why shouldn\u2019t your odds be as high as possible?\u201d\n Don\u2019t change things up for YC\u2019s sake: \u201cDo whatever you can do to make your company as successful, as real as possible\u2026 but don\u2019t try to like, pretty up your company for YC,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s never smart [to do] for an investor. Don\u2019t make bad short-term decisions because you think there\u2019s a deadline that you should do wrong things for. Instead, build your company for the long term, and do the best you can possibly do to find product market fit, to build the right product, to build the right technology, to build the right software or whatever it is you\u2019re building.\u201d\n Later in the video (around the  40:55 mark), a question from the audience leads Ralston back to the topic, and he has a few more pieces of advice:\n Stick to the instructions: \u201cThe instructions are fairly clear. It says: do a one-minute video, have all the founders there, and talk to us. That\u2019s a good idea! Don\u2019t give us some marketing video, we\u2019re not interested in that. That\u2019s not how we\u2019re making our decision.\u201d\n Hone your pitch: \u201cThink about expressing yourself concisely, with great clarity. It does not help to write a book in the application. Be kind to us! We\u2019re reading, you know,  hundreds of applications. Get your idea across as clearly as you can. That\u2019s actually a really good signal to us, if you can describe what you\u2019re doing with a minimum of words. That helps us a ton.\u201d\n Tell your story: \u201cDo not skimp on talking about yourselves!\u201d Ralston notes. \u201cWe are super interested in you, who you are, and why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-08-11 06:37:45", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "ralston,president,yc", "title": "\nY
