He was one of the most influential figures in the history of jazz, and he had a prolific output (just on Spotify, he has over 1,000 songs). Many of these are different recordings of the same song, but jazz is so improvisational that it’s difficult to draw the line of what counts as a distinct song.</p><p>迈尔斯戴维斯（1926-1991）是一个爵士小号手，带宽机和作曲家。他是爵士历史上最有影响力的人物之一，他有一个多产的产出（就在Spotify上，他有超过1000首歌）。其中许多是同一首歌的不同录音，但爵士乐是如此即使是难以将重要的歌曲绘制到一个独特的歌曲。</p><p> My aim with this guide is to write something that would have been very helpful to me when I started listening to Miles Davis. I will list and discuss the albums that I view as essential listening, and bullets beneath will list my favourite songs from that album. This list is far from comprehensive and there are many albums I chose to leave out. This means that the jazz fusion period is underrepresented, because I personally don’t like it as much as his earlier work. Miles was famously difficult, rude, and beat his wives on multiple occasions. So do not take this piece as an endorsement of him as a person. If you feel that I missed something important, please don’t hesitate to  contact me.</p><p> 我与本指南的目标是在我开始听迈瓦斯时，写一些对我非常有帮助的东西。我将列出并讨论我认为是必不可少的听力的专辑，下面的子弹将列出我最喜欢的歌曲。此列表远非全面，并且有许多我选择遗漏的专辑。这意味着爵士融合时期不足，因为我个人不喜欢他早期的工作。迈尔斯着名很难，粗鲁，并在多个场合击败他的妻子。所以不要把这件作品作为一个人的认可。如果你觉得我错过了一些重要的东西，请不要犹豫与我联系。</p><p> This post is grouped chronologically within periods, but the different periods overlap so it’s not strictly chronological. Some of the years in this post may be confusing because of the lag between recording and release. The years I mention are from the date of release. This difference is most apparent for  Cookin’,  Relaxin’, Workin’ and  Steamin’ with the Miles Davis Quintet, all of which were recorded over a two-day session in 1956 (!) to complete Davis’ contract with Prestige records.</p><p> 这篇文章在时间顺序分组，但不同的时期重叠，所以它不是严格的时间。由于录音和释放之间的滞后，这篇文章中的一些岁月可能会令人困惑。我提到的几年是从发布之日起。这种差异对于使用Miles Davis Quintet的Cookin'，Caplein'，Workin'和Steamin'最为明显，所有这些都是在1956年（！）的两天会议上录制了戴维斯的合同。</p><p> There is a perception that jazz is dead, and Davis himself even famously declared that jazz was dead. This is pretty unfair. For one thing, almost all of jazz is on Spotify now at amazingly high quality. For another, the decline of the cultural centrality to jazz has led to a decline in the price of concert tickets, etc., such that there’s high returns to having expertise. Tyler Cowen  writes that “current times are the very best for jazz, ever”.</p><p> 有一种看法，爵士乐已经死了，戴维斯自己甚至宣称爵士乐已经死了。这是非常不公平的。有一件事，几乎所有的爵士都在惊人的高质量上发现了Spotify。另一方面，对爵士乐队的文化中心的衰落导致音乐会门票价格下降等下降，使得拥有专业知识的高回报。 Tyler Cowen写道，“当前时间是爵士乐的最佳时间”。</p><p> Jazz is so interesting to me because of its fusion of intricate underlying structure with improvisation and spontaneity. As Ken Burns put it, jazz is “familiar, but brand new every night”. Moreover, I enjoy the intellectual demandingness of jazz as a genre. Jazz musicians seem to be the most thoughtful and intelligent of any genre. Many of the more Avant Garde songs mentioned in this post don’t sound good unless you’re really concentrating. Some of it sounds cacophonous to a newcomer. This is why jazz is considerably more difficult to get into than other genres and has a lack of listenership among the youth.</p><p> 爵士乐对我来说非常有意思，因为它具有完善和自发性的复杂性结构的融合。正如肯烧的那样，爵士爵士是“熟悉的，但每晚全新”。此外，我喜欢爵士乐的智力求求作为一种类型。爵士音乐家似乎是任何类型最周到和最聪明的人。这篇文章中提到的许多更安全的歌曲听起来不太好，除非你真的很集中。一些它听起来很高兴对新人来说。这就是为什么爵士乐比其他类型更困难，并且在青年中缺乏倾听。</p><p> Disclaimer: I’m a philistine with limited musical knowledge or ability. This guide is by no means meant to be authoritative. But I worked very hard on it. So, after hundreds of hours of listening, I present to you: a beginner’s guide to Miles Davis. You may find this guide significantly more helpful if you follow along with  this playlist on Spotify, which compiles all of the featured songs in order.</p><p> 免责声明：我是一个有限的音乐知识或能力的哲学家。本指南绝不是有权威的。但我努力工作。所以，经过数百小时的听力，我介绍给你：初学者指南达维斯。如果您在Spotify上遵循此播放列表，您可能会发现本指南明显更有用，从而按顺序编译所有特色歌曲。</p><p>  Miles Davis’ career spanned the most important eras in jazz. He replaced  Dizzy Gillespie as trumpeter for the quintet of the legendary saxophonist  Charlie Parker, which is how he first came to notoriety. There’s a lot of static on the earlier recordings. This doesn’t bother me so much anymore, but in any case, I recommend remastered versions where you can find them. My overall highlights from this era are  Boplicity,  Four, and  Bags’ Groove.</p><p>  迈尔斯戴维斯的职业生涯跨越了爵士乐中最重要的时代。他将昏昏欲睡的吉布斯替换为小号手，为传奇萨克斯管师查理帕克的五餐，这就是他首先出现的人。早期录音上有很多静态。这不再打扰我了，但在任何情况下，我都推荐你能找到的重新制作版本。我从这个时代的整体亮点是Boplicity，Four和Bags's Groove。 </p><p>        In general, there are many remastered, extended and reissued versions of all of Davis’ popular songs and albums, and frequently no canonical version. Luke Muehlhauser talked about this on his  blog, which I recommend.</p><p>一般来说，所有戴维斯热门歌曲和专辑的重新制作，扩展和重新发行版本，并且通常没有规范版本。 Luke Muehlhauser在他推荐的博客上谈过这个。</p><p>   If you listen to this album, it’ll probably be the  Rudy Van Gelder (RVG) remaster. Van Gelder was a legendary audio engineer known for editing in such a way that produced a distinctive sound.</p><p>   如果您倾听这张专辑，那么它可能是鲁迪范格特（RVG）麦克风。梵德德是一种传奇音频工程师，以便以这样的方式编辑，从而产生了独特的声音。</p><p>    As far as I know, this album played an important part in the etymology of the word cool. Davis, with his suits, beautiful women, and suave look, was the definition of cool. He was part of what it  meant to be cool. In his later more experimental years his clothing was much more unusual, colourful, and counter-cultural. Another interesting thing about this album is how Davis exemplified a kind of 50s masculinity, but his music was disarming and romantic. It was very common for couples to go to see him in jazz clubs together.</p><p>    据我所知，这张专辑在很酷的词源中发挥了重要作用。戴维斯，伴随着他的衣服，美丽的女人和苏娃外观，是凉爽的定义。他是它意味着很酷的一部分。在他以后更加实验的岁月中，他的衣服更加不寻常，丰富多彩，以及反文化。关于这张专辑的另一个有趣的事情是戴维斯如何示例着一种50年代的男性气质，但他的音乐正在解除武装和浪漫。夫妻俩在爵士乐俱乐部一起去看他是非常常见的。</p><p>    Miles Davis’ band repeatedly shifted in its composition, but it can be roughly grouped into two stable periods: the First Great Quintet and the Second Great Quintet. There is a famous debate among Miles Davis fans over which quintet is better. The First Quintet had  Red Garland on piano,  Paul Chambers on bass,  Phill Joe Jones on drums, and  John Coltrane on tenor sax.  Cannonball Adderley later joined with alto saxophone (making it a sextet). Davis had a reputation for featuring up-and-coming unknown artists on his album, and he launched Coltrane’s career. If you are only vaguely familiar with Davis sound, it’s likely this is the period that you recognise. It includes Kind of Blue, the best-selling jazz album of all it.  Bill Evans replaced Red Garland on piano for some of this period, most famously on Kind of Blue. My overall highlights from this era are  ‘Round Midnight,  Walkin’,  Milestones,  My Funny Valentine and  So What.</p><p>    Miles Davis的乐队在其组合中反复转移，但它可以大致分为两个稳定的时期：第一个伟大的Quintet和第二次伟大的Quintet。在里程戴维斯粉丝中有一个着名的辩论，其中Quintet更好。第一个五级有钢琴上的红色花环，在贝斯的Paul Chambers，在鼓声乔·琼斯上的Paul Joe Jones，在Tenor Sax上的John Coltrane。炮弹adderley后来加入了萨克斯管（使它成为六分）。戴维斯在他的专辑中具有崭露头角的未知艺术家的声誉，他推出了Coltrane的职业生涯。如果你只是含糊地熟悉戴维斯的声音，那可能这是你认识到的时期。它包括蓝色，全部畅销的爵士专辑。比尔埃文斯在这一时期的一些时期取代了钢琴的红花环，最着名的蓝色。我从这个时代的整体亮点是'六边形午夜，走路'，里程碑，我的有趣的情人节，那么。</p><p>    ‘Round Midnight by Thelonious Monk is one of the most famous jazz standards. Miles was the origin of many jazz standards, including Milestones and So What.</p><p>    “由雷可兰和尚的午夜是最着名的爵士标准之一。迈尔斯是许多爵士标准的起源，包括里程碑，那么。</p><p>        One interesting feature of jazz is that it’s a fundamentally American genre. Americans songs dominate every popular genre, but jazz especially so. Some of this is because of the specific role played by race relations in jazz history. But one could speculate that there’s a deeper reason. America, at its best, has separation of powers and constitutional protections. It’s all about error-correction and human fallibility. Jazz, likewise, is all about revising and improvising. Contrast this with continental Europe, which has spent much of its history falling prey to one utopian ideology or another, with classical as the dominant music of high culture.</p><p>        爵士乐的一个有趣的特征是它是一个从根本上的美国类型。美国人歌曲占据了每一个受欢迎的类型，但爵士乐尤其如此。其中一些是因为爵士历史中的竞争关系扮演的具体作用。但人们可以推出更深层次的原因。美国，最好的，有能力和宪法保护的分离。这完全是关于纠错和人类的识别。同样，爵士乐是关于修改和提高的。将其与大陆欧洲造成鲜明对比，这花了大部分历史将猎物陷入了一个乌托邦理发学或其他历史，经典为高文化的主导音乐。</p><p>   It’s worth mentioning that the mid-to-late 50s was the apex of Davis’  cool jazz period. This is much lower tempo than  bebop, which is characterised by fast continuous saxophone melodies and is where Davis got his start. Cool jazz is what people might think of as ‘coffee table jazz’. I sometimes work while listening to it, but other sub-genres within jazz are too fast-paced and complex for me to listen to while concentrating on something else. Some jazz purists would disdain the idea of listening to jazz while working at all, as opposed to giving it your full attention. Indeed, before maybe a year ago, I had never intensely listened to music while doing nothing else for any significant period, because I got bored too easily. But now I usually listen to jazz while browsing the album covers, and very often with my eyes closed.</p><p>   值得一提的是，到晚50年代中期是戴维斯酷爵士时期的顶点。这比Bebop比Bebop更低了，其特点是快速连续的萨克斯管旋律，并且是戴维斯的开始。酷爵士乐是人们可能认为作为'咖啡桌爵士'的人。我有时会在听它的同时工作，但爵士乐中的其他子类型太快，而且对我来说，在专注于别的时听起来很复杂。有些爵士纯粹主义者会蔑视听爵士乐的想法，而一直在工作，而不是让它完全关注。实际上，在可能一年前之前，我从来没有在任何重要时期那里做任何别的时都没有谈论音乐，因为我太容易感到厌倦。但现在我通常在浏览专辑封面时听爵士乐，而且经常闭着眼睛。 </p><p>    This was a major force in the introduction of  modal jazz, characterised by switching among musical modes. Tyler Cowen described the album as the ‘Mona Lisa’ of jazz: undeniably a great work of art, but overplayed and overrated. Nonetheless, I think it’s essential to listen to all of it. The last few songs listed here are from the extended edition of the album. I recommend the extended versions of most of these albums, where one exists, and listening to alternate takes of the same song. Sometimes the albums also include banter from the band, in which you can hear Miles’ famously raspy voice, which he acquired because of a throat condition.</p><p>这是引进模态爵士乐的主要力量，其特征在于乐音模式。 Tyler Cowen将专辑描述为Jazz的“Mona Lisa”：无可否认的艺术品，但夸大和高估了。尽管如此，我认为倾听所有人都很重要。这里列出的最后几首歌曲来自专辑的扩展版本。我推荐大多数这些专辑的扩展版本，其中一个存在，并收听替代歌曲。有时，专辑还包括乐队的聊天，您可以听到近距离的“着名的Raspy声音”，因为喉咙状况。</p><p>   If you really liked any of the music from before this point, you’ll probably like most or almost all of it. One of the great things about jazz is that there’s a functionally infinite amount of top-tier jazz, supposing you don’t have extremely niche tastes, while with almost everything else I consume I struggle to find content I love that I haven’t already read/watched/listed to.</p><p>   如果您真的喜欢从这一点之前的任何音乐，那么您可能最喜欢或几乎所有音乐。关于爵士爵士的伟大事物之一是，有一个功能无限的爵士乐，假设你没有极大的利基口味，而几乎所有其他我消耗的东西我都会努力寻找我所爱的内容我还没有阅读/观看/列出。</p><p>   Salt Peanuts has been stuck in my head a lot recently. Because jazz usually doesn’t have any vocals, it’s harder at first for songs to get stuck in your head or to tell them apart. With time, I’ve gotten a lot better at this. There are certainly excellent jazz vocalists –  Ella Fitzgerald,  Billie Holiday,  Chet Baker. But there is something to be said for consciously choosing to not have any lyrics in your music. Asking why jazz doesn’t have any words strikes me as a bit like asking why novels don’t have any pictures. The music speaks for itself.</p><p>   最近盐花生一直被困在我的脑海里。因为爵士通常没有任何声乐，因为歌曲陷入脑袋或告诉他们分开时，这更加艰难。随着时间的推移，我已经好了。肯定有一个优秀的爵士乐歌手 - 艾拉菲茨杰拉德，比利假日，切特贝克。但有意识地选择没有音乐中的任何歌词，有一些东西可以说。问为什么爵士爵士没有任何话语袭击我有点像问为什么小说没有任何照片。音乐为自己说话。</p><p>   Someday My Prince Will Come (yes, it’s based on the theme from Snow White)</p><p>   有一天我的王子会来（是的，它是基于雪白的主题）</p><p> This may be my favourite album cover of all time. In general, the album covers from the golden era of jazz are  absolutely gorgeous. This seems like a lost art because album covers are so much less prominent in the digital era. The  Sketches  of Spain,  Miles Ahead, and  Birth of the Cool covers are all iconic. I think that one of the first things that drew me to jazz, before I had any appreciation for the music, was the way people looked when they were playing it. They just looked so cool!</p><p> 这可能是我最喜欢的专辑封面。一般来说，爵士爵士的金色时代的专辑涵盖绝对华丽。这似乎是一个迷失的艺术，因为专辑封面在数字时代突出得多。西班牙的草图，英里的英里，和凉爽的封面的诞生都是标志性的。我认为在我对音乐欣赏之前，将我戴上爵士乐爵士的第一件事之一是人们在玩它的时候看起来。他们看起来很酷！</p><p>  Davis’ collaboration with the pianist and arranger  Gil Evans was legendary. My overall highlights are  Miles Ahead,  The Duke,  Summertime, and  Solea.</p><p>  戴维斯与钢琴家和安排吉尔埃文斯的合作是传奇的。我的整体亮点是未来，公爵，夏季和索尔盟。</p><p>   Another point: this is not dancing music. I believe that some of Davis’ concerts even had signs up to stop people from dancing. This is in stark contrast to earlier years of jazz, which developed around a culture of dancing halls and highly rhythmic music. Take this with a grain of salt, but it  seems like one of the motivations for this era of jazz was to prove to white people that black people were capable of inventing a rich and complex art form that was musically on a par with classical. Indeed,  Lee Morgan, the jazz trumpeter, famously said that jazz should be called “black classical music”.</p><p>   另一点：这不是跳舞音乐。我相信一些戴维斯的音乐会甚至签署了令人厌恶的人。与爵士乐的早期爵士州的鲜明对比，这在舞厅的文化和高度节奏的音乐周围发展。用一粒盐带来这一点，但它似乎是这个爵士乐时代的动机之一是向白人证明，黑人能够发明富裕和复杂的艺术形式，这是一个与古典相提并论的标志。事实上，吉斯摩根，爵士队小号手，着名的是，爵士乐应该被称为“黑色古典音乐”。 </p><p>   Porgy and Bess is a famous opera by George Gershwin. The Gershwin songbook has been covered many times, and the  rendition by Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald might be the most famous. There have been more arrangements of summertime than anyone can keep track of, but I think Davis’ may well be the best.</p><p>Porgy和Bess是George Gershwin的着名歌剧院。 Gershwin Songbook已经多次涵盖，Louis Armstrong和Ella Fitzgerald的演绎可能是最着名的。夏季的安排比任何人都可以跟踪，但我认为戴维斯可能是最好的。</p><p>    This album was inspired by his wife, Frances Taylor Davis, and her love of flamenco dancing.  Sketches appears to be his first movement toward an acoustic-electric sound. I was surprised to learn that this album is somewhat controversial among Davis fans, so I think it’s thoroughly underrated.</p><p>    这张专辑的灵感来自他的妻子，Frances Taylor Davis，以及她对弗拉门戈舞蹈的热爱。草图似乎是他对声音电动声音的第一次运动。我很惊讶地知道这张专辑在戴维斯粉丝中有点争议，所以我认为它彻底被低估了。</p><p>  Miles Davis’ Second Great Quartet had  Herbie Hancock on piano,  Ron Carter on bass,  Tony Williams on drums, and  Wayne Shorter on tenor saxophone. Its sound was more unconventional, and arguably the 60s are passed the ‘golden era’ of jazz.  E.S.P. and  Seven Steps  to Heaven are my favourite albums from this era. My overall highlights are  Seven Steps to Heaven,  E.S.P. and  Agitation.</p><p>  迈尔斯戴维斯的第二次伟大的四重奏在钢琴上有Herbie Hancock，罗恩卡特在Bass，Tony Williams在鼓上托尼·威廉姆斯，而韦恩队更短的萨克斯管。它的声音更加不传统，可以说60年代通过了爵士乐的“金色时代”。 E.S.P.天堂的七个步骤是来自这个时代最喜欢的专辑。我的整体亮点是天堂，E.S.P.的七步和激动。</p><p>   One of my favourite things about jazz is the extent to which its subject matter is universal. Many (most?) popular songs are about love, which is fine, but it’s narrow. The best jazz is a kind of philosophical meditation about the tension between planning and improvisation. The benefits of bottom-up versus top-down design. The extent to which life is an interrelated mesh of trade-offs and constraints. How beauty – and perfection –balances on a knife-edge between order and chaos.</p><p>   关于爵士乐的最喜欢的事情之一是其主题是普遍的程度。许多（大多数？）流行的歌曲是关于爱情，这很好，但它很窄。最好的爵士乐是一种关于规划与即兴创作之间的紧张局势的哲学冥想。自下而上与自上而下设计的好处。生命的程度是相互关联的权衡和约束的网格。美容如何 - 订单和混乱之间的刀刃上的平衡。</p><p>    I don’t have the musical talent to predict which way a piece of jazz will go, but there is a very satisfying way in which it feels like the notes  makes sense after they’re played. It’s curious: I feel like asking ‘how could it have been otherwise?’, when of course, it could easily have been otherwise.</p><p>    我没有乐音才能预测，这是一块爵士乐将会去的方式，但是有一种非常令人满意的方式，在他们玩耍后感觉就像音符一样感觉。这很好奇：我觉得问'怎么可能已经呢？'，当然，它很容易被别的。</p><p>   Bill Evans, who was a pianist with the Miles Davis Quintet for a time, once said “There are no wrong notes, only wrong resolutions.” The way the very same note can sound totally different when played accidentally by an amateur compared to consciously played by a virtuoso is fascinating to me.</p><p>   比尔埃文斯，谁是钢琴家，戴维斯Quintet一段时间，曾经说过“没有错误的笔记，只有错误的决议。”相比，同样的票据可以与业余的意外播放相比，与艺术家的有意识地扮演的业余令人迷人的方式，这就是相同的票据。</p><p>   Nefertiti is one of Davis’ last albums of ‘conventional’ jazz before he developed a more experimental style.</p><p>   Nefertiti是戴维斯的最后一张“常规”爵士乐的最后一张专辑之一，在他开发了更实验的风格之前。 </p><p>  One of the key things to understand about Miles Davis is the extent to which he was continuously switching up his style and changing genres. Jazz fusion and Avant Garde jazz are acquired tastes. I found  Directions to make for the easiest listening. My favourite songs from this section are  Love for Sale,  Duran and  Black Satin.</p><p>了解迈尔斯戴维斯的关键事情之一是他不断换取他的风格和改变类型的程度。爵士融合和前卫爵士爵士被收购品味。我找到了最简单的聆听方向。来自这一部分的我最喜欢的歌曲是待售，杜兰和黑缎面。</p><p>   The trumpeter Wynton Marsalis once  said that “in jazz, every moment is a crisis.” This was a much more elegant way of putting one of my earlier points about the universality of the themes in jazz.</p><p>   小号手Wynton Marsalis曾经说过“在爵士乐中，每一刻都是危机。”这是一个更优雅的方式，使我早期的一个关于主题的普遍性在爵士乐中的普遍性。</p><p>      Perhaps the most famous jazz fusion album of all time. There are single versions and shorter edits of many of these songs, which you might appreciate if you don’t like listening to long songs. Many of his fusion pieces are 30+ minutes long.</p><p>      也许是有史以来最着名的爵士融合专辑。许多歌曲中有单一版本和更短的编辑，如果您不喜欢听长歌曲，您可能会欣赏。他的许多融合件长30分钟。</p><p>    Miles took a lot of inspiration from world music, as evidenced in  Sketches. This album uses a lot of Indian percussion.</p><p>    迈尔斯从世界音乐中汲取了很多灵感，如草图所证明。这张专辑使用了很多印度的打击乐器。</p><p>   Placing this in the fusion period is somewhat of a mischaracterisation, because this album compiles 15 years’ worth of previously unreleased tracks. Nonetheless, the title track is the first recording where Davis used electric instruments.</p><p>   将其放置在融合时期有点减少错误，因为这张专辑汇总了15年的价值以前未发行的轨道。尽管如此，标题曲目是戴维斯使用电气器械的第一个录制。</p><p>     Davis continued making music until he died in 1991, but the most recent material is of more mixed quality and never really found an audience. Some of the live recordings from this period are much better, however, as we’ll see in the next section.</p><p>     戴维斯继续制作音乐，直到1991年去世，但最近的材料质量更加混合，从未真正找到了观众。然而，一些从这一段时间的现场录音都好多了，因为我们将在下一节中看到。</p><p>  I actually prefer listening to live recordings. They often last much longer than the originals and they give interesting re-imaginings and re-interpretations of familiar tracks. My favourite songs in this section are  So What,  Walkin’,  Générique,  Sur l’autoroute and  Autumn Leaves.</p><p>  我实际上更喜欢听取现场录音。他们经常比原件更长，他们给出了有趣的重新想象和对熟悉赛道的重新解释。我最喜欢的歌曲是什么，walkin'，générique，sur l'autoroute和秋叶。 </p><p>   This album was an improvised soundtrack for a French film. After spending some time in France in the 50s, Davis was frustrated when he returned to America’s more backward racial attitudes. It’s possible that this anger influenced his music, but I really don’t know.</p><p>这张专辑是法国电影的简易解乐架。在50多岁的法国花了一段时间后，当他回到美国更落后的种族态度时，戴维斯受挫。这种愤怒可能影响了他的音乐，但我真的不知道。</p><p>   One of the themes I find most interesting in jazz is the constant tension between improvisation and planning. The different takes sound really different to one another. You would naively think that, however good your music is when you’re composing on the spot, it must be better when you can plan it out in advance. But something is lost when you write the music down. In the very early days of jazz, even the introduction of recording technology was controversial, because when you can record music there is a sense in which it becomes set in stone, and unchanging. But jazz, it was argued, was all about change and revisions. There’s an obvious parallel here with Socrates’ dislike of writing. I say “on the spot” but this is unfair: jazz improvisation requires tremendous practice and intellectual effort. People sometimes conflate “genius” with “very talented”, but so far as I’m concerned, Miles Davis was legitimately a genius in this regard.</p><p>   我发现最有趣的爵士乐的主题是即兴创作与规划之间的不断紧张。不同的声音彼此真实不同。你天真地认为，然而，你的音乐很好，当你当场撰写时，当你提前计划它时，它必须更好。但是，当你向下写音乐时，一些事情就会丢失。在爵士的初期，即使引入录音技术也是有争议的，因为当你可以录制音乐时，有一个有意义的意义，它变成了石头，而且不变。但是爵士乐，它被认为是关于改变和修订。这里有一个明显的平行与苏格拉底的写作不喜欢。我说“当场”，但这是不公平的：Jazz即兴创作需要巨大的实践和智力。人们有时会用“非常有才华”混淆“天才”，但到目前为止，迈尔斯戴维斯在这方面是一个天才。</p><p>      Side note: It’s striking how many errors are made in the transcription of lesser-known albums onto Spotify. A lot of the songs on this album have inconsistent capitalisation, i’s that aren’t capitalised, and others have spelling errors.</p><p>      侧面注意：在Spotify的较少收藏夹中，在较鲜明的专辑的转录中令人醒目。这张专辑的很多歌曲都有不一致的资本化，我是不是大写的，而其他专辑则具有拼写错误。</p><p>   This was recorded the year that Davis died, with  Quincy Jones. You can tell that he had lost some of his technical proficiency with the trumpet by this point. While Davis was at a time extremely fit and enjoyed boxing, decades of frequent alcohol, cocaine, and heroin use took its toll. With Davis, though, you’re generally not listening for technical proficiency: he certainly couldn’t play faster or higher than some other trumpeters. It’s more that his style is incredibly distinctive. Even today, I’m not aware of any trumpeter that can make their instrument sound the same way Miles could, which is an impressive feat for any musician.</p><p>   这是戴维斯去世的那一年，与昆西琼斯去世。你可以告诉他在这一点上失去了他的一些技术熟练程度。虽然戴维斯是一次非常适合和享受的拳击，但数十年的频繁的酒精，可卡因和海洛因使用造成的损失。然而，与戴维斯，你一般没有倾听技术熟练程度：他当然不能比其他一些小号家更快或高。他的风格更令人难以置信地独特。即使在今天，我也不知道任何可以让他们的乐器听起来像英里的乐器声音的任何小号，这是任何音乐家的令人印象深刻的壮举。</p><p>   Miles Davis wrote an autobiography with Quincy Troupe, which understandably is essential reading for understanding him.</p><p>   迈尔斯戴维斯写了一篇与昆西剧团的自传，可以理解地是理解他的重要阅读。</p><p>  This is a documentary series and accompanying book. I haven’t been able to find a place to affordably watch the documentary, but I recommend the book wholeheartedly. I also recommend  this YouTube interview with Wynton Marsalis and Ken Burns about the series. A quote I liked: “When historians in 1,000 years look back on America, it’ll be remembered for three things: baseball, the constitution, and jazz.”</p><p>  这是一本纪录片系列和随附的书籍。我没有能够找到一个经济守望纪录片的地方，但我全心全意地推荐这本书。我还推荐这个YouTube采访Wynton Marsalis和Ken关于该系列的烧伤。我喜欢的报价：“当历史学家在1000年来回顾美国时，它会被记住三件事：棒球，宪法和爵士乐。”</p><p>  This film is set during Davis’ dormant period in the late 70s in which he was struggling with drug addiction and not making any music. It’s pretty good, though not amazing. The film was Don Cheadle’s directorial debut and stars Don Cheadle and  Obi-Wan Kenobi Ewan McGregor. Cheadle did a great job with the raspy voice. People who know about this sort of thing say that the fingering and playing look believable because Cheadle actually learned how to play trumpet for the film.</p><p>  这部电影在戴维斯在戴维斯的休眠期间设定了70年代后期，其中他正在努力吸毒成瘾而不是做任何音乐。它非常好，但不是惊人的。这部电影是Don Cheadle的导演首次亮相和明星Don Cheadle和Obi-Wan Kenobi Ewan McGregor。 Cheadle与Raspy的声音做得很好。了解这种事情的人说，指法和玩耍看起来可信，因为Cheadle实际上学会了如何为电影演奏小号。 </p><p> The film was scored by the excellent  Robert Glasper, who also produced the ending track, which is really good. I’ve included the Go Ahead John edit from the film in the  playlist. I have had frustrations trying to find jazzy hip hop where the jazz wasn’t just bad or excessively electronic. Kendrick Lamar and Glasper seem like exceptions to this. Glasper also made a  video for Wired where he reviewed jazz scenes in films, which you should watch.</p><p>这部电影由优秀的Robert Glasper评分，他还产生了结局轨道，这真的很好。我已经包括前瞻John John编辑从播放列表中的电影。我挫败了试图找到爵士嘻哈，爵士乐不仅仅是糟糕或过度电子。 Kendrick Lamar和Glasper似乎是例外。 Glasper还为有线提供了一个有线的视频，他在那里审查了你应该观看的电影中的爵士乐场景。</p><p>  One of my favourite documentaries. It contains interviews with Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Frances Taylor Davis, and others. They even interviewed the French woman whom Davis had a relationship while he was living in Paris in the 50s. The soundtrack is really good, and it includes  Donna Lee, which I’ve also included in the companion  playlist.</p><p>  我最喜欢的纪录片之一。它包含与Herbie Hancock，Wayne较短，Frances Taylor Davis等采访。他们甚至采访了戴维斯在50年代居住在巴黎关系的法国女性。 Soundtrack非常好，它包括Donna Lee，我也包括在同伴播放列表中。</p><p>  There were interesting discussions about Miles Davis on the Conversations with Tyler episodes with  John McWhorter and  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (you can search the transcripts to skip to the relevant part). I’m not sure whether they mention Davis specifically, but Tyler Cowen’s discussions with the music critics  Alex Ross and  Ted Giola are also excellent. Giola now has a  Substack that you should subscribe to if you enjoyed this post. I also enjoyed  this video from the YouTube channel Polyphonic about  Kind of Blue.  All  of  his  other  videos about  jazz are also worth watching.</p><p>  有趣的讨论与John McWhorter和Kareem Abdul-Jabbar的泰勒剧集对话的谈话有趣的戴维斯（你可以搜索转录物以跳到相关零件）。我不确定他们是否具体提到戴维斯，但Tyler Cowen与音乐评论家Alex Ross和Ted Giola的讨论也很好。 Giola现在有一个别的东西，你应该订阅如果你喜欢这篇文章。我还从YouTube频道复音上享受了这个视频，关于那种蓝色。他的所有其他关于爵士乐的视频也值得关注。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://samenright.com/2021/06/06/a-beginners-guide-to-miles-davis/">https://samenright.com/2021/06/06/a-beginners-guide-to-miles-davis/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/戴维斯/">#戴维斯</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/guide/">#guide</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
