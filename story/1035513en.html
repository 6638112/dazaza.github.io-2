On an April afternoon, I arrived at the Hollywood Art Deco building that has long served as Fincher’s base of operations, where he was about to look at footage from his 10th feature film,  “Gone Girl,” then in postproduction. We headed upstairs and found the editor Kirk Baxter assembling a scene. Fincher watched it once through, then asked Baxter to replay a five-second stretch. It was a seemingly simple tracking shot, the camera traveling alongside Ben Affleck as he entered a living room in violent disarray: overturned ottoman, shattered glass. The camera moved at the same speed as Affleck, gliding with unvarying smoothness, which is exactly how Fincher likes his shots to behave. Except that three seconds in, something was off. “There’s a bump,” he said.</p><p>六年前，在我联系David Fincher并告诉他我想写一篇有关他如何制作电影的文章之后，他邀请我到办公室亲自介绍我的案子，而当我在那儿时，看着他完成一些工作。 4月的一个下午，我到达了好莱坞艺术装饰风格的大楼，该大楼长期以来一直是Fincher的业务基地，他将在那里观看他的第十部长片《 Gone Girl》的录像，然后进行后期制作。我们上楼去，发现编辑柯克·巴克斯特（Kirk Ba​​xter）正在组装场景。 Fincher观看了一次，然后要求Baxter重播五秒钟。这是一个看似简单的跟踪镜头，当本·阿弗莱克（Ben Affleck）进入一个充满混乱的起居室时，他和本·阿弗莱克（Ben Affleck）一起旅行：翻转了矮凳，碎玻璃。相机以与Affleck相同的速度移动，并以不变的平滑度滑动，这正是Fincher喜欢他的镜头表现的方式。除了三秒钟，什么都没有发生。他说：“有一个障碍。”</p><p> No living director surpasses Fincher’s reputation for exactitude. Any account of his methods invariably mentions how many takes he likes to shoot, which can annoy him, not because this is inaccurate but because it abets a vision of him as a dictatorially fussy artiste. Fincher, who is 58, argues that this caricature misses the point: If you want to build worlds as engrossing as those he seeks to construct, then you need actors to push their performances into zones of fecund uncertainty, to shed all traces of what he calls “presentation.” And then you need them to give you options, all while hitting the exact same marks (which goes for the camera operators too) to ensure there will be no continuity errors when you cut the scene together. Getting all these stars to align before, say, Take No. 9 is possible but unlikely. “I get, He’s a perfectionist,” Fincher volunteered. “No. There’s just a difference between mediocre and acceptable.”</p><p>在世的导演中，没有哪一个能超越芬彻的声誉。关于他的方法的任何叙述都总是提及他喜欢拍摄多少张照片，这会惹恼他，这不是因为这不准确，而是因为这助长了他对独裁艺术家的看法。芬奇现年58岁，他认为这种讽刺意味没有抓住重点：如果您想建立像他想要建构的世界那样令人着迷的世界，那么您需要演员将他们的表演推向肥沃的不确定性区域，以摆脱他的一切痕迹。称为“演示”。然后，您需要他们给您提供选项，同时都击中完全相同的标记（相机操作员也是如此），以确保将场景剪裁在一起时不会出现连续性错误。让所有这些恒星在例如第9号之前对齐，这是可能的，但不太可能。 “我明白，他是一个完美主义者，”芬彻自愿参加。 “没有。平庸和可以接受之间只有一个区别。”</p><p> Baxter played the sequence again, and this time I spotted a little artifact of the camera operator’s hand — a hiccup before the shot came to rest. Jeff Cronenweth, the cinematographer on “Gone Girl” and several other Fincher features, told me later that Fincher stays vigilant for any distractions onscreen that might pull audiences off “the ride” he’s constructing. “It could be unconscious — you could come out of a movie that had 10 soft shots, meaning they’re out of focus, and say, ‘That was pretty good.’ But David’s thought process is to eliminate all of that — to fight to make sure that there aren’t any of those mistakes.” Brad Pitt, who has starred in three Fincher films, recalled times when they would “be doing a shot, and there would be the slightest imperceptible wiggle from the camera, and you could see Finch literally tense up — like, it physically hurts him.”</p><p>百特再次播放了该序列，这次我发现了相机操作员手的一些伪影-镜头静止之前出现了打h。电影《失落的女孩》的摄影师杰夫·克罗南威斯（Jeff Cronenweth）和芬奇的其他几本影片后来告诉我，芬奇对屏幕上可能引起观众分心的任何干扰保持警惕。 “这可能是无意识的-您可能从一部有10张柔和镜头的电影中脱颖而出，这意味着它们没有聚焦，然后说，'那很好。'但大卫的思想过程是消除所有这些-进行战斗以确保没有任何错误。”曾在三部Fincher电影中出演过的布拉德·皮特（Brad Pitt）回忆起他们“做镜头”的时光，镜头中会有丝毫不为人所知的摆动，您会发现芬奇实际上紧张不安-像那样，身体受到了伤害。 ”</p><p> Fincher put an encouraging hand on Baxter’s shoulder: “Looks great otherwise,” he said. We returned to Fincher’s office, where fabric swatches suspended overhead softened the sun pouring in from a skylight. I hadn’t realized it, but Fincher was at something of a crossroads. “Gone Girl” was due out that October, and although he had adapted it with the author Gillian Flynn from her  enormously popular thriller, the film’s commercial success was in no way guaranteed. His previous feature,  “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo” — a lavish, lurid $90 million adaptation of another best seller, meant to kick off a trilogy — came in fourth at the box office on its opening holiday weekend, underperforming such competitors as “Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked.” The trilogy was put on ice.</p><p>芬彻在巴克斯特的肩膀上伸出了令人鼓舞的手：“否则看起来很棒，”他说。我们回到芬彻的办公室，那里悬挂着布样，使从天窗射入的阳光变得柔和。我还没意识到，但芬彻正处在十字路口。 《失落的女孩》原定于十月发行，尽管他与作者吉利安·弗林（Gillian Flynn）一起改编自广受欢迎的惊悚片，但影片的商业成功却丝毫没有保证。他先前的剧本《龙纹身的女孩》（这是另一部畅销书的豪华，诱人的9000万美元改编，意在拉开三部曲）在上映假日周末票房排名第四，表现不及“ Alvin和花栗鼠：沉船。”三部曲放到了冰上。</p><p> Fincher had worked in Hollywood long enough to take this in relative stride. He was familiar with the business’s unpredictability, not to mention its venality. In recent years, though, studios had grown ever hungrier for blockbusters and ever less likely to finance the mid-budget movies Fincher excelled at, like his masterpiece,  “Zodiac” (2007) or  “The Social Network” (2010). Or, for that matter, an unmade project called “Mank,” the screenplay of which, written by Fincher’s journalist father, Jack, sat on a shelf in his office among Taschen tomes and other bric-a-brac. “Mank” told the story of how the screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz came to write “Citizen Kane” (the landmark 1941 Orson Welles film, about a loosely fictionalized version of the American tycoon William Randolph Hearst) while slowly drinking himself to death.</p><p>芬奇在好莱坞工作了足够长的时间，以取得相对的进步。他熟悉公司的不可预测性，更不用说它的活力了。不过，近年来，制片厂对大片的渴望越来越强烈，而资助Fincher擅长制作的中档电影的可能性也越来越小，就像他的代表作《黄道十二宫》（2007）或《社会网络》（2010）一样。或者，就此而言，还有一个未完成的项目，名为“ Mank”，该电影的剧本是由Fincher的记者父亲杰克（Jack）编写的，坐在他的办公室书架上，藏在Taschen手提袋和其他书中。 《曼克》讲述了编剧赫曼·曼凯维奇（Herman Mankiewicz）如何写《公民凯恩》（1941年具有里程碑意义的奥森·威尔斯电影，讲述的是美国大亨威廉·兰道夫·赫斯特（William Randolph Hearst）的一幅虚构的版本）并慢慢饮酒致死的故事。</p><p>  Fincher would later tell me that the idea for the film first arose “around ‘Alien 3,’” his first feature and a notorious fiasco. (He was the third director hired onto a beleaguered production, forced to start shooting before the movie had an ending and then shut out of the final edit — the result being a commercial bomb he is not alone in reviling.) In an ideal world, he said, he would have made “Mank” instead of  “Alien 3,” “but I had to go off and slit my own throat in slow motion.” Over the years, Fincher kept his hopes for the movie alive, even as other jobs beckoned and financiers showed little appetite for a movie “about old movies that’s black and white that no one will understand.”</p><p>芬彻后来告诉我，这部电影的构想最初是围绕“外星人3”出现的，这是他的第一部长片，而且声名狼藉。 （他是受困于这部陷入困境的制作的第三位导演，被迫在电影结局之前开始拍摄，然后被拒之门外，最终导致了商业炸弹的袭击，他并不孤单。）在理想的世界中，他说，他本来可以用“ Mank”代替“ Alien 3”，“但是我必须走开，以慢动作割开自己的喉咙。”多年来，芬切（Fincher）使他对这部电影的希望永存，尽管其他工作招手招呼，而金融家对这部电影也没有兴趣，“这部电影是黑白电影，没人会理解。”</p><p> When “Gone Girl” came out, it would gross a monstrous $370 million — but by that point Fincher was done making movies, at least for a while. Directing the 2013 pilot of the Netflix series  “House of Cards” inspired him to do more TV. He proposed that I anchor my profile to the big-budget remake of the dark British series “Utopia” that he was planning to direct for HBO. He also mentioned his desire to adapt “Mindhunter,” a true-crime book about the genesis of the F.B.I.’s psychological-profiling unit. This series would distill one of his career-long thematic preoccupations: the tension — and bleed — between forces of anarchy, violence and perversity on one side, and efforts to thwart, decode, taxonomize and otherwise control that chaos on the other.</p><p>当《消失的女孩》（Gone Girl）发行时，票房总额达到了惊人的3.7亿美元，但那时候芬彻（Fincher）已经完成了电影的制作，至少有一段时间了。导演2013年Netflix系列“纸牌屋”的飞行员，启发了他制作更多电视节目。他提议我将自己的个人资料固定在他打算为HBO导演的英国深色系列“乌托邦”的大预算翻拍中。他还提到了他希望改编一本关于联邦调查局心理档案室起源的真正犯罪书籍“ Mindhunter”。该系列文章将提炼出他整个职业生涯中的一项专心研究：一方面无政府状态，暴力和颠覆力量之间的紧张和流血，另一方面则是阻止，解码，分类和控制混乱的努力。</p><p> But as the months turned into years, “Utopia” stalled in a budgetary impasse at HBO, and my article stalled along with it. In 2016, Fincher moved to Pittsburgh to oversee production on  “Mindhunter,” and when I sent an email about visiting him there, I received no reply. He made two seasons — the first one good, the second one excellent — and then, by last year, was ready to return to moviemaking. “It sounds ridiculous, but I didn’t realize how all-encompassing showrunning was,” he told me this past March, the two of us in his office once again. “Ninety-hour weeks, and you never get ahead.” Netflix, he explained, invited him to tackle “ ‘something small that you’ve always wanted to do.’ I said, ‘I’ll send you this script.’ I didn’t tell them it was black and white. I didn’t tell them it was period.”</p><p>但是随着时间的推移，数月之久，“理想国”陷入了HBO的预算僵局，我的文章也随之停滞。 2016年，Fincher搬到了匹兹堡，负责监督“ Mindhunter”的制作，当我发送一封电子邮件拜访他时，没有收到任何回复。他做了两个赛季，第一个赛季好，第二个赛季好，然后到去年，准备重返电影制作。 “这听起来很荒谬，但我没有意识到如何实现全方位的表演。”他在今年三月告诉我，我们两个人再次在他的办公室里。 “九十小时的一周，你永远都无法取得成功。”他解释说，Netflix邀请他解决“”您一直想做的小事。”我说，“我将向您发送此脚本。”我没有告诉他们这是黑白的。我没有告诉他们那是时期。”</p><p> Somewhat to his surprise, they bit: “I said, ‘Really?’” And so he invited me back to Los Angeles as he worked to complete his 11th feature film — “Mank.”</p><p>令他有些惊讶的是，他们有点：“我说，'真的吗？'”于是，他在完成第11部长片《曼克》的工作中邀请我回到洛杉矶。</p><p> “Mank” has deep reverberations with post-2016 America. It’s set in Hollywood at the tail end of the Great Depression, when Americans became destitute by the millions, grotesque wealth was concentrated among ruling classes determined to stifle a nascent socialist wave (there is a “fake news” subplot involving Upton Sinclair’s 1934 campaign for governor of California) and fascism loomed here and overseas. Against this backdrop, the film tells the story of how a “singularly great writer,” as Fincher characterized Mankiewicz, was “given cover by Orson Welles to drain his bile about the haves and the have-nots, and about Willie Hearst’s singular lack of empathy for the have-nots.”</p><p>“ Mank”对2016年后的美国产生了深远的影响。它坐落在好莱坞的大萧条末期，当美国人被数百万人沦为穷人时，怪诞的财富集中在执政阶级中，这些阶级决心扼杀新生的社会主义浪潮（存在“假新闻”子情节，涉及厄普顿·辛克莱尔1934年竞选加利福尼亚州州长）和法西斯主义在这里和海外若隐若现。在这样的背景下，影片讲述了芬奇（Fincher）描绘曼凯维奇（Mankiewicz）的“奇妙作家”的故事，“奥森·威尔斯（Orson Welles）掩饰了他的胆汁，使人们了解了贫富，以及威利·赫斯特（Willie Hearst）缺乏奇异之处。对那些没有的人表示同情。”</p><p> Fincher shot the movie in and around Los Angeles with Gary Oldman in the title role, and by the time of my visit, he was three and a half weeks into a 10-week cut. “We went six days over — so this is what we have to work with,” he said. He spoke in a tone less of dismay and more of shrugging acceptance, exuding a calm that stood in contrast to the world outside his office walls. Just the day before, the spreading coronavirus had forced the N.B.A. to suspend its season, and panic was mounting. Every now and then, Fincher read news updates aloud from an iPad, but mostly he stayed focused on “Mank”-related tasks. (The following week, Fincher’s staff members would begin working remotely or in staggered shifts that allowed for distancing.)</p><p>芬切（Fincher）以加里·奥德曼（Gary Oldman）的名义在洛杉矶及其周围拍摄了这部电影，到我拜访时，他已经有三个半星期的时间进入了10周的剪辑。他说：“我们已经进行了六天，所以我们必须与之合作。”他说话的语调不但令人沮丧，而且更耸耸肩接受，散发着与办公室墙外世界形成鲜明对比的平静。就在前一天，传播的冠状病毒迫使N.B.A.暂停其季节，并且恐慌情绪越来越高。 Fincher时不时地从iPad上大声朗读新闻更新，但大部分时间他始终专注于与“ Mank”相关的任务。 （接下来的一周，芬彻的工作人员将开始进行远程工作或以轮换的方式进行工作，以便进行疏散。）</p><p>  The significance of “Mank” for Fincher is multilayered. For one, he reveres “Citizen Kane.” “I don’t think it’s the greatest American movie ever made,” he said, “but it’s in the top three — and they made it in  1941.” (“The Godfather Part II” and “maybe ‘Chinatown’” round out his podium.) For another, Jack Fincher — whom David described as “the most important writer in my life, and not only the person who first introduced me to ‘Citizen Kane’ but the person who first introduced me to movies” — died in 2003 of pancreatic cancer, with the screenplay in its eighth draft.</p><p>“曼克”对芬彻的意义是多层的。其中之一，他尊敬“公民凯恩”。他说：“我认为这不是美国有史以来最伟大的电影，但它在前三名中-他们是1941年制作的。” （“教父第二部分”和“也许是'唐人街'完善了他的演讲台。”另外，杰克·芬彻（Jack Fincher）-大卫被戴维形容为“我一生中最重要的作家，而不仅仅是向我初次介绍我的那个人”公民凯恩（Kane），但第一个向我介绍电影的人”-因胰腺癌于2003年去世，其剧本在其第八稿中。</p><p> “When Jack retired,” Fincher went on, “he said, I really want to write a screenplay.” Fincher encouraged him to reread  “Raising Kane,” Pauline Kael’s 1971 tribute to Mankiewicz: “I said, Is there a movie in Mankiewicz pulling this thing out of the ether and laying it out for this movie brat to make? And Jack went off and wrote the script, and it was really good.” The only thing requiring much revision, he said, was that his father “never understood Hollywood’s inherent cynicism — he didn’t understand the magnetic pull for the sociopath that Hollywood has.”</p><p>“杰克退休后，”芬彻继续说道，“他说，我真的很想写一部剧本。” Fincher鼓励他重读Pauline Kael于1971年向Mankiewicz致敬的影片《 Raising Kane》：“我说过，Mankiewicz中有一部电影将这件事从以太坊中拉出来并布置成电影小子来制作吗？然后杰克离开去写了剧本，真的很棒。”他说，唯一需要做大修改的事情是，他的父亲“从来不了解好莱坞的内在犬儒主义。他不了解好莱坞对社会病态的吸引力。”</p><p> Fincher has a wry sense of humor. You can read his affection for a wit like Mankiewicz’s through his own love of cutting remarks, which he delivers in a spirit of sporting fun. At one point, looking at old movie trailers together — he was planning to model promotional materials for “Mank” on them — we watched one for “Gone With the Wind,” during which Fincher remarked: “It’s just a soap opera, isn’t it? With a large staircase.”</p><p>芬奇有着幽默感。您可以通过自己对剪切话语的热爱来阅读他对Mankiewicz这样的机智的热爱，他本着体育娱乐的精神来传达这一点。有一次，他看着旧的电影预告片一起-他正计划在上面制作“曼克”的宣传材料-我们观看了一部“随风而逝”，在那段时间里芬奇评论道：“这只是一部肥皂剧，不是吗？”是吗？有一个大楼梯。”</p><p> He wore a white T-shirt under a gray cardigan, and among the items arranged neatly on his gray-stained wood desk were eight pairs of eyeglasses, a gold-edition Apple Watch given to him by Jony Ive, a packet of black adhesive webcam covers promising “privacy protection” and a notepad with DAVID FINCHER in block letters atop each page (another gift). As he spoke, his fingers wiped and dabbed at the surface in front of him, clearing away particles real and imagined in an absent-minded exercise of un-doodling. “I think he’s O.C.D., in a way,” the screenwriter Eric Roth, a friend and repeat collaborator of Fincher’s, told me later. “I love sitting at his desk and mucking with all his lenses and watching him wipe up the condensation from the Diet Coke I was just drinking.”</p><p>他穿着一件灰色开衫下面的白色T恤，在整整齐齐地放在灰色染色的木桌上的物品中，有八副眼镜，一盒由乔尼·艾夫（Jony Ive）送给他的金版Apple Watch，这是一包黑色粘性摄像头。在每页上都用大写字母覆盖了有前途的“隐私保护”和DAVID FINCHER的记事本（另一份礼物）。在他说话时，他的手指擦了擦，擦在他前面的表面，清除了涂鸦过程中虚构的真实和想象中的粒子。 Fincher的朋友兼重复合作伙伴编剧埃里克·罗斯（Eric Roth）后来对我说：“从某种意义上说，我认为他是O.C.D.。” “我喜欢坐在他的办公桌旁，with着他所有的镜头，看着他擦掉我刚喝的健怡可乐中的冷凝水。”</p><p> After a bit, Fincher made for a small screening room, where we met Eric Weidt, the colorist for “Mank,” who was charged with balancing its blacks, whites and grays to Fincher’s satisfaction. The rough conceit in crafting the movie’s look and sound, Fincher said, was: “What if this film was made concurrently with ‘Kane,’ and what if Welles had something to do with it?” Camera angles were low; focus was deep. Footage — shot with a monochrome sensor that Fincher first asked the digital-camera company RED to develop for him back in 2012 — would be treated to look like old film stock. Fincher’s longtime sound designer, Ren Klyce, would oversee a team of technicians as they analyzed the audio spectrum of films from the era and — in an elaborate process that included “rerecording the final mix in a theater to give it even more of an old-theater-sound feel,” as Ceán Chaffin, Fincher’s producing partner and wife, put it — worked to make “Mank” sound like them, too.</p><p>过了一会儿，芬奇来到一个小型放映室，在那里我们遇到了“曼克”的调色师埃里克·魏德（Eric Weidt），他负责平衡黑色，白色和灰色，使芬奇满意。 Fincher说，在制作电影的外观和声音时，粗略的想法是：“如果这部电影是与'Kane'同时制作的，而Welles与之有关系呢？”相机角度很低；重点很深。影片是用单色传感器拍摄的，这是Fincher在2012年首先要求数码相机公司RED为他开发的影片，看起来像是旧的胶卷。 Fincher的长期声音设计师Ren Klyce将负责监督一组技术人员，他们分析了该时代电影的音频频谱，并且在一个精心设计的过程中包括“在剧院中重新录制最终混音以使其具有更多的老式声像，剧院声音的感觉，”正如Fincher的制作合伙人和妻子塞恩·查芬（CeánChaffin）所说的那样，也努力使“曼克”听起来像他们。</p><p> Fincher likes to fiddle with every last thing we see and hear in his films, seeking out new digital techniques with each project that allow him to fiddle on an increasingly granular scale. For “Mank,” he would creep through scenes a frame at a time — drawing clouds into open skies, multiplying roadside dust kicked up by passing cars, tweaking the brilliance of background street lamps so they didn’t give off the telltale (to him, if not to me) shine of the “modern metal-halide fixtures” they actually were. Knowing that he has this much power awaiting him in editing has made Fincher much looser on set than he used to be. He mentioned a scene at the end of “Mank” in which there were hairs coming out of Amanda Seyfried’s wig (she plays Marion Davies, the movie star and romantic companion to Hearst). Seyfried’s hair, he recalled, “crossed in front of her eyes, and they wanted to cut and run in. I said, ‘She’s giving us great stuff.’ ‘What about the hairs?’ ‘I can get rid of them later, trust me.’”</p><p>芬切喜欢摆弄电影中我们看到和听到的所有最后的东西，在每个项目中寻找新的数字技术，使他能够以越来越细微的大小摆弄。对于“ Mank”，他一次要在一个场景中爬行-将乌云吸引到开阔的天空中，乘以路过的汽车踢出的路边灰尘，调整背景路灯的亮度，以使它们不散布故事（对他而言） （如果不是我的话）实际上是“现代金属卤化物灯具”的光芒。知道他有这么多的力量在等待编辑，这使Fincher的场景比以前更加宽松。他提到“ Mank”结尾处的一幕，其中有阿曼达·塞弗里德（Amanda Seyfried）假发露出的头发（她饰演电影明星马里昂·戴维斯和赫斯特的浪漫伴侣）他回忆说，塞弗里德的头发“交叉在她的眼前，他们想剪成一条路。我说，'她给了我们很多东西。''那根头发呢？''相信我。'”</p><p> One of the most remarkable techniques Fincher has helped to pioneer is called shot stabilization. Since “The Social Network,” he has captured a frame as much as 20 percent larger than the one he needs for his final picture. This creates a buffer of excess visual information that allows him to digitally correct for the slightest trembles, lurches and late starts, erasing all imperfections from the camera movement. His shots come to represent the gliding, unmediated gaze of some impossible — and faintly malevolent — eye: “I want it to feel omniscient,” Fincher said.</p><p>Fincher帮助开拓的最杰出的技术之一就是射击稳定。自从“社交网络”以来，他拍摄的画框比他最后一张照片所需要的画框大20％。这会创建过多的视觉信息缓冲区，使他能够以数字方式校正最轻微的颤抖，倾斜和起步较晚，从而消除了相机运动中的所有瑕疵。芬奇说：“他的镜头表现出了一些不可能的，微弱的恶毒之眼的滑动，无中介的凝视：“我希望它感觉无所不知。</p><p> Stabilization also allows Fincher and his editors to reframe entire shots after the fact and to construct seamless split-screen composites, suturing different takes into one. For a straightforward example of a stabilized Fincher shot, you can watch the  “red band” trailer for “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo” and note the ominous, tractor-beam smoothness with which the camera is drawn toward the Vanger mansion. But it’s an effect Fincher deploys on material as seemingly inconsequential as a character setting a drink on a table, and he wound up stabilizing every single shot in “Mank” — a film he calls “as labor intensive, on a pixel-by-pixel basis, as any Marvel movie.” Chaffin characterized his scrupulousness on “Mank” in affectionately needling terms: “David is such a freak,” she said, “he’s going to touch every frame.”</p><p>稳定还使Fincher和他的编辑可以在事后重新构图整个镜头，并构建无缝的分屏合成，将不同的镜头缝合在一起。关于稳定的Fincher拍摄的简单示例，您可以观看“带龙纹身的女孩”的“红色乐队”预告片，并注意将照相机拉向Vanger大厦时不祥的牵引束平滑度。但这是芬奇在材料上部署的一种效果，似乎与角色在桌上摆放饮料的姿势无关紧要，而且他最终稳定了“曼克”中的每一个镜头，他称这部电影“劳动强度大，逐像素”就像任何一部Marvel电影一样。”查芬用深情的针刺刻画了他对“曼克”的谨慎态度：“大卫真是个怪胎，”她说，“他将触及每一帧。”</p><p> The fundamental formal pleasure of watching a Fincher film is that every last micron of the experience has been considered, and then reconsidered, with an abundance of love, skill and precision. Seated beside Weidt, Fincher scanned “Mank” for elements that either delighted (“I love the little edge-light under his ear hairs”) or irked him. When Fincher complained about the brilliance of a bit player’s collar, I remarked that his eye was traveling to details that audiences would most likely never notice. “Hopefully!” Fincher said, adding: “We’re trying to control where people’s eyes go, so they don’t end up looking at stuff that’s just going to confuse them. Which is the simplest way to describe what directing is: ‘How do I get them to look where I need them to look?’”</p><p>观看Fincher电影的基本形式上的乐趣在于，对经历的每一个细节都经过深思熟虑，然后再以丰富的爱意，技巧和精准度进行重新考虑。 Fincher坐在Weidt旁边，扫描“ Mank”中是否有使他感到高兴的元素（“我爱他的头发下面的小边缘光”）或使他讨厌。当Fincher抱怨某个球员的衣领的光彩夺目时，我说过他的视线正朝着观众很可能不会注意到的细节移动。 “希望！”芬彻说，他补充说：“我们正在努力控制人们的视线，以使他们最终不会看到只会使他们感到困惑的事物。描述方向的最简单方法是：“如何让他们看到需要他们看的地方？”</p><p> In films like  “Fight Club” and  “Panic Room,” Fincher used special effects to send his camera flying into refrigerator wiring and through coffeepot handles, and for this reason he is sometimes associated with a flashy, careening style. But Erik Messerschmidt, the cinematographer on “Mindhunter” and “Mank,” stressed how, since “Zodiac,” Fincher has leaned toward a “very classical” visual rule book whose fundamentals predate French New Wave and  vérité. Fincher tends to eschew hand-held shots except in rare cases, and his camera typically moves only when an actor does — and at the same speed. Cronenweth told me that “in the majority of features,” Fincher’s rule is that if an actor “slides forward a bit, we slide with them. They adjust, we adjust. They stop, we stop. David’s very clever about designing movement to enhance a scene — not for the sake of movement, but to be that much more intimate with the characters.”</p><p>在诸如“战斗俱乐部”和“电影室”之类的电影中，芬彻使用特殊效果将相机悬挂在冰箱的电线上，并通过咖啡壶的手柄，因此，他有时会显得浮华，热情。但是，“ Mindhunter”和“ Mank”的摄影师Erik Messerschmidt强调，自“黄道十二宫”以来，Fincher如何朝着“非常古典的”视觉规则书倾斜，其基本原理早于法国新浪潮和vérité。芬奇（Fincher）倾向于避免手持镜头，除非极少数情况，他的相机通常仅在演员以相同速度移动时才移动。克罗宁韦斯（Cronenweth）告诉我，“在大多数功能中，”芬彻的规则是，如果一个演员“向前滑动一点，我们就会与他们一起滑动。他们调整，我们调整。他们停下来，我们停下来。大卫非常聪明地设计运动来增强场景-不是为了运动，而是与角色更加亲密。”</p><p>  Brad Pitt, who calls Fincher one of “the funniest [expletive] I’ve ever met,” often gets together with him for movie nights, during which, Pitt said, “He’ll be muttering the whole time: ‘That shot works. That’s a bad handoff. Why would you go to the insert of the glove there? Stabilize!’ It’s like watching a football game with Bill Belichick.” (Fincher described playing his favorite video game, Madden NFL, as “the only time I’m not thinking about movies.”) Another close friend is the filmmaker Steven Soderbergh, who told me about visiting Fincher during postproduction on his 2002 thriller, “Panic Room.” Soderbergh described the scene this way: “David had a laser pointer out, and he was circling this one section of a wall in the upper part of the frame, saying, ‘That’s a quarter of a stop too bright.’ I had to leave the room. I had to go outside and take some deep breaths, because I thought, Oh, my God — to see like that? All the time? Everywhere? I wouldn’t be able to do it.”</p><p>布拉德·皮特（Brad Pitt）称芬奇为“我见过的最有趣的[粗暴]”，他经常和他在一起参加电影之夜，在此期间，皮特说：“他会一直在喃喃地说道：' 。那是一个不好的交接。你为什么要去那儿插入手套？稳定！’这就像和比尔·贝里奇克（Bill Belichick）观看足球比赛一样。” （芬奇将玩自己喜欢的视频游戏《疯狂的美国橄榄球》（Madden NFL）描述为“这是我唯一一次不考虑电影。”电影制片人史蒂芬·索德伯格（Steven Soderbergh）告诉我关于芬奇在2002年惊悚片的后期制作中访问过的经历，恐慌室。”索德伯格以这种方式描述了这一场景：“戴维伸出了激光指示器，他正在画框上部的一堵墙上盘旋，说：'那太近了四分之一。'我不得不离开房间。我不得不走到外面深呼吸，因为我想，哦，我的上帝-看到那样的东西？每时每刻？到处？我做不到。”</p><p> I asked Soderbergh to name his favorite Fincher film, and he replied that choosing one was tough, but if he ranks them according to the one he rewatches most, the answer is “Panic Room.” This is an uncommon pick. The film — in which Jodie Foster fends off home invaders over the course of a single night — is a spring-loaded formal exercise, set almost entirely in one location, that offers no overarching points about human nature, or the limits of the knowable, or the sociopathic extremes of ambition, the way other Fincher films have done. And yet, Soderbergh argued: “I don’t know anybody else who would imagine executing something like that and then actually have the fortitude to do it. It makes my head hurt watching it. It makes my knees buckle.”</p><p>我请索德伯格为他最喜欢的芬彻电影命名，然后他回答说，选择一部很难，但是如果按照最喜欢的一部来对它们进行排名，答案就是“ Panic Room”。这是一个不常见的选择。这部电影-朱迪·福斯特（Judie Foster）在一个晚上里抵御住了侵略者-这是一部充满春天色彩的正式演习，几乎全部设置在一个位置，没有提供关于人性或已知界限的总体观点，或野心勃勃的野心，这是其他Fincher电影所做的方式。然而，索德伯格辩称：“我不认识其他人，他们会想象执行这样的事情，然后真正有决心去做。看着它使我的头部受伤。它使我的膝盖弯曲。”</p><p>  Soderbergh was careful to praise more than Fincher’s formal mastery: “I think because people are blinded by his outsize visual dexterity, he doesn’t get enough credit for his understanding of story.” Several collaborators emphasized this point. Eric Roth, who wrote Fincher’s  “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” and helped finalize the script for “Mank,” told me that Fincher “understands narrative and the purpose of things in a script maybe more than I do.” Andrew Kevin Walker, who wrote  “Se7en” — Fincher’s shockingly dark serial-killer blockbuster — and has done uncredited work on other Fincher films, said, “If David wanted to take the time, he could write his movies himself.”</p><p>Soderbergh不仅要赞美Fincher的正式能力，还要谨慎地赞美他：“我认为，由于人们对他超凡的视觉灵敏性视而不见，因此他对故事的理解并没有得到足够的认可。”一些合作者强调了这一点。埃里克·罗斯（Eric Roth）曾写过芬彻（Fincher）的《本杰明·巴顿（The Benjamin Button）的好奇案例》，并帮助敲定了《曼克》（Mank）的剧本。他告诉我，芬奇“比其他人更能理解剧本的叙述和目的。”安德鲁·凯文·沃克（Andrew Kevin Walker）曾写过《芬奇的黑暗连环杀手》惊人的大片《 Se7en》，并在芬奇的其他影片上做过无证工作。他说：“如果大卫想花时间，他可以自己写电影。”</p><p> Discussing screenwriting at one point, Fincher said that “coming up with a great line is not actually the gift of the screenwriter. The gift is, When do they say it?” And, he added, “strategically deployed silence can be just as breathtaking.” One actor, Holt McCallany, who co-starred on “Mindhunter” as the F.B.I. agent Bill Tench, relayed a striking anecdote that illustrated this point. In the series’ second season, Tench has learned that while he was chasing serial killers in the field, his preadolescent son was involved in a heinous crime at home. The child stops speaking, his behavior continues to unsettle and Tench’s family life comes under severe strain. “My marriage is falling apart, and in this scene I’m trying to connect with my little boy at an ice-cream parlor,” McCallany said. “And during rehearsal, David said, ‘This is the moment that it hits you: This is what it’s going to be from now on. It’s not going to change.’”</p><p>在谈到编剧时，芬彻说：“拿出精彩的台词实际上并不是编剧的天赋。礼物是，他们什么时候说？而且，他补充说，“战略部署的沉默可能同样令人叹为观止。”一位演员霍尔特·麦卡兰尼（Holt McCallany）出演了《猎杀者》（Mindhunter），并担任F.B.I.特工比尔·滕奇（Bill Tench）转达了一个有趣的轶事，说明了这一点。在该系列剧的第二季中，滕奇获悉，他在野外追捕连环杀手时，他的青春期儿子在家中犯下了令人发指的罪行。孩子停止说话，他的行为继续变得不安，Tench的家庭生活受到严重压力。麦卡兰妮说：“我的婚姻破裂了，在这个场景中，我正试图与我的小男孩在一家冰激凌店里保持联系。” “在排练期间，大卫说：‘这是打到您的那一刻：这就是从现在开始的样子。这不会改变。’”</p><p> This bleak interpretation “hadn’t occurred to me,” McCallany said. Fincher managed, with one note, to illuminate the show’s driving themes: the fallibility of authority, the folly of trying to build a bulwark against the inexplicable. “That’s what it means to be in the presence of a great director,” McCallany said. “Because what he said wasn’t in the lines.”</p><p>麦卡兰妮说，这种荒凉的解释“对我而言没有发生”。芬彻设法用一个音符阐明了该节目的驱动主题：权威的谬误，试图对无法解释的东西建立堡垒的愚蠢行为。麦卡兰妮说：“这就是拥有出色导演的意义。” “因为他说的话不在话下。”</p><p> On his desk, beside his keyboard, Fincher keeps a black-and-white photograph of Jack at rest — on a sofa, hands clasped, eyes closed. It’s a shot that Fincher took in 1976, when he was just 14. “That’s why it’s out of focus,” he told me. Fincher was born in Denver, but when he was small, his parents moved to Marin County, just north of San Francisco, where Jack wrote for LIFE and </p><p>Fincher在桌子上和键盘旁边，让Jack保持静止状态的黑白照片-在沙发上，双手紧握，双眼紧闭。这是芬彻（Fincher）在1976年拍摄的镜头，当时他才14岁。 Fincher出生于丹佛，但在他小的时候，他的父母就搬到了旧金山北部的马林县，杰克在那写信给生活和</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/magazine/david-fincher-mank-interview.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/magazine/david-fincher-mank-interview.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/可能/">#可能</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/fincher/">#fincher</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/电影/">#电影</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
