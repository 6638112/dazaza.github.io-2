Now he stood in the belly of the block in his suit and tie, pulled down his mask and announced that he was putting us under quarantine.</p><p> 当有人喊道时，我在纽约州南部的纽约州的监狱牢房里，“诉讼徒步旅行！” Sullivan惩教设施主管，这是一个名叫威廉钥匙柜的60岁的灰化男子，已经进入了一个绑在他脸上的面具的细胞块，伴随着一对代表。现在他站在他的西装和领带的街区的肚子里，拉下了他的面具并宣布他正在检疫的地方。</p><p> I’m incarcerated with some 400 men in Sullivan, a 36-year-old prison about 100 miles north of Manhattan. During normal times, prisoners can spend several hours a day outside our cells, even in maximum-security facilities like this one — attending programs, exercising, swinging mops, swapping packs of cigarettes, hustling. But with the winter cold settling in, Covid-19 deaths in New York prisons had spiked over the previous two weeks to 29 as of Jan. 14, and authorities had suspended most prison programs and movement.</p><p> 我在曼哈顿以北约100英里的36岁的监狱中被监禁。在正常时期，囚犯可以在我们的细胞外每天花几个小时，即使在这一的最高安全设施中，也是如此 - 参加计划，锻炼，摆动拖把，交换卷烟，喧嚣。但随着冬季寒冷的沉降，纽约监狱的Covid-19死亡在前两周飙升至1月14日，当局暂停了大多数监狱计划和运动。</p><p> For the foreseeable future, Keyser said, we’d be locked in our cells for all but one hour each day. We’d already been feeling especially confined, with visiting rooms closed statewide since December of last year. Now it was going to get worse. “It’s a bit of a long haul,” Keyser acknowledged. He made rounds, answering questions from men in their cells. Then he and his deputies left, to repeat the announcement in Sullivan’s other cell blocks.</p><p> 对于可预见的未来，keyser表示，我们每天都被锁定在我们的细胞中。我们已经感到特别局限于，访问室自去年12月以来州际旅馆封闭。现在它会变得更糟。 “这有点长，”钥匙家承认。他做出了回合，回答了他们细胞中的男人的问题。然后他和他的代表离开了，在沙利文的其他细胞块中重复宣布。</p><p> When Covid arrived in the United States last year, I was incarcerated in Westchester County, one of the pandemic’s first hot spots, at Sing Sing Correctional Facility. Even as people on the outside were required to wear face coverings indoors, Sing Sing’s roughly 1,300 prisoners, not provided with masks, had to walk around barefaced or make do with handkerchiefs. State records show that 66 people incarcerated at the facility have tested positive as of the end of March. But testing was extremely limited early on, and I surmise that many more have been infected, myself included. (Last April, I had a fever, lost my sense of taste and felt short of breath.) Four prisoners and one officer have died.</p><p> 当Covid去年抵达美国时，我在唱歌惩教设施时被威彻的第一个热点之一被监禁。即使在外面的人们需要在室内穿面部覆盖物时，唱歌的大约1300名囚犯没有提供面具，不得不赤行徒步或用手帕做。国家记录显示，截至3月底，该设施被监禁的66人经过了肯定的。但是早期测试非常有限，我推动了更多感染的人，我已经包括更多。 （去年4月，我发烧了，失去了我的味道和呼吸短暂。）四名囚犯和一名军官已经死亡。</p><p> So I was relieved when, last summer, I was transferred to a two-tiered cellblock in Sullivan called D North. Sullivan had escaped the worst of the pandemic, and in my nearly 20 years of prison living, its cells were the best I’d seen. There was hot water in the sinks and a sliver of a window, and I could stretch out both arms without touching the cinder-block walls. The view from the second tier was like that of a mezzanine seat in a theater. I could see the common area with tables and seats and, beyond it, the cells across from me, on both floors. The 60 men of D North would be my new neighbors.</p><p> 所以我在去年夏天的时候被解脱出来，我被转移到一个名为D North的沙利文中的双层细胞壁。沙利文逃脱了大流行中最糟糕的，在我近20年的监狱生活中，它的细胞是我所看到的最好的。水槽中有热水和窗口的条子，我可以伸出两个胳膊而不触摸煤渣壁。第二层的视图就像剧院的夹层座位一样。在两个楼层上，我可以看到带有桌子和座位的公共区域，超越它，来自我的细胞。 D North的60名男人将是我的新邻居。</p><p> By then, safety practices were improving. Officers brought us cloth and surgical masks somewhat regularly. New York State Clean hand sanitizer, bottled by my peers at the Great Meadow Correctional Facility, filled dispensers all over New York, including in prisons. The smell of alcohol and bleach and water wafted through the facility. For a while, being in prison during a pandemic didn’t feel as apocalyptic as it once had.</p><p> 然后，安全实践正在改善。官员会带来我们的布料和手术面具。纽约州清洁洗手液，由我的同龄人装瓶在伟大的草地惩教机构，填充纽约的填充分配器，包括监狱。通过该设施挥动的酒精和漂白剂和水的味道。有一段时间，在大流行期间在监狱中曾经像曾经一样成为世界末日。 </p><p> But now, under lockdown, cell fever set in. Normally energetic men started oversleeping, then slogging through the day, elbows on their bars, babbling nonsense. My neighbor alternated between laughing out loud at nothing in particular and singing R.&amp;B. for hours.</p><p>但是现在，在锁定下，细胞发热套装。通常精力充沛的男人开始睡过头，然后在一天中甩掉，肘部在他们的酒吧，唠叨废话。我的邻居在大声笑不比不比不比不比说，唱着r＆amp; b。用了几个小时。</p><p> Cell fever set in. Normally energetic men started oversleeping, then slogging through the day, elbows on their bars, babbling nonsense.</p><p> 细胞发烧套装。通常精力充沛的男性开始睡过头，然后甩掉一天，肘部在他们的酒吧，唠叨废话。</p><p> For one hour a day, eight of us at a time would be allowed out to shower, make phone calls and connect our prison-issued tablets to a kiosk to send and receive messages through a private communications provider called JPay. Before my cell was unlocked, I’d make a mental to-do list. It usually included securing spots on the phone and kiosk, then taking a quick shower. I might stop by some blockmates’ cells, which we were free to do; it felt good to have conversations that weren’t shouted through bars.</p><p> 每天一个小时，我们八个会允许淋浴，拨打电话，并将我们的监狱发布的平板电脑连接到自助服务终端，通过私人通信提供商发送和接收消息，聘请JPay。在我的细胞解锁之前，我会做一个心理到待办事项清单。它通常包括在手机和亭子内保护斑点，然后快速淋浴。我可能会被一些碉堡的细胞停止，我们可以自由地进行;在没有通过酒吧喊叫的谈话感到很好。</p><p> Afterward, I’d wait for a blockmate working as a porter to wipe down a phone with bleach and water before letting me use it. I’d call my 75-year-old mom in Fort Lauderdale, who’d talk to me about her cat, her Parkinson’s and family gossip. Every time, I’d ask if she’d gotten the vaccine yet. She’d tell me she hadn’t. She didn’t bother to ask if I had.</p><p> 之后，我等待一个碉堡作为搬运工，在让我用它之前，用漂白剂擦拭手机。我会在劳德代尔堡打电话给我75岁的妈妈，他谈谈了我的猫，她的帕金森和家庭八卦。每次，我都会问她是否已经得到了疫苗。她告诉我她没有。如果我有的话，她不打算问。</p><p> At one point it seemed as if prisoners everywhere could be among the first in line for Covid-19 vaccines. In November, after the federal government announced their imminent arrival, the American Medical Association recommended that we be prioritized to receive them, along with others living in congregate settings where it’s difficult to keep people apart.</p><p> 在一个点，它似乎随着囚犯到处都是Covid-19疫苗的第一个。 11月，联邦政府宣布迫在眉睫的抵达后，美国医学会建议我们优先收到他们，以及生活在聚集环境中的其他人，在那里难以让人们分开。</p><p> That made sense to me. Nationwide, at least  one in five prisoners has tested positive as of December, according to the nonprofit Marshall Project, four times the rate of those on the outside. (I’m a contributing writer for the Marshall Project.) More than 2,500 have died, at twice the outside rate. The mortality rate for incarcerated New Yorkers is actually lower than for those outside prison, but incarcerated New Yorkers have tested positive at a higher rate. And it wasn’t only about protecting us. With staff members and visitors coming in and out all the time, those of us in here are part of the same ecosystem that you all out there belong to. Even if we can’t leave, the virus can.</p><p> 对我来说是有道理的。根据非营利组织项目的数据，全国范围内，至少有一名囚犯在12月份进行了积极的测试，根据非营利组马歇尔项目，这是一个外界的速度的四倍。 （我是Marshall项目的贡献作家。）超过2,500人死亡，两倍于外部速度。被监禁的纽约人的死亡率实际上低于监狱的人，但被监禁的纽约人以更高的价格测试了阳性。这不仅仅是为了保护我们。与工作人员和访客一直进出，我们在这里的那些是与您所在的同一生态系统的一部分。即使我们不能离开，病毒也可以。</p><p> Early in the pandemic, though, states started coming up with vastly different policies around vaccinating incarcerated people. California, Massachusetts and New Jersey made prisoners eligible early on. But by late January, New York officials still hadn’t announced any such plans, putting the state behind at least 27 others that had. The governors of  Washington and  Kentucky have each granted more than 1,000 commutations during the pandemic, lowering prison populations in the hopes of reducing transmission. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York has commuted only 31 sentences, though he has also released nearly 4,000 people early by other means.</p><p> 然而，在大流行早期，各国开始在接种疫苗的疫苗接种的人周围提出不同的政策。加利福尼亚州，马萨诸塞州和新泽西州赋予了符合条件的囚犯。但到1月底，纽约官员仍未宣布任何此类计划，将国家落后于其他27人。华盛顿和肯塔基州的州长在大流行期间授予了超过1,000个换向，降低了监狱群体，希望减少传播。纽约的纽约·安德鲁M. Cuomo只有31个句子，虽然他还通过其他方式发布了近4000人。 </p><p> Sometimes I heard about these developments from Michael Antinuche, who lives in a downstairs cell across from me, listens to NPR ad nauseam and had become obsessed with all things Covid. (He pronounces it “Cober.”) A rough 49-year-old gangster from Queens, raspy-voiced and round-bodied, Antinuche is serving 25 years to life for a conviction on murder, assault and weapons-possession charges. We call him Mikey Meatballs.</p><p>有时我听说过来自迈克尔···阿特内奇的这些发展，他在楼下的楼下，侦听NPR AD Nauseam，并陷入了所有的东西Covid。 （他将其发出“Co-caber”。我们称他为Mikey Meatballs。</p><p> Meatballs is a hardened guy, but Covid, the invisible enemy, tormented him; he hoped to get out and see the daughter he’d never known as a free man. She was born two months after his arrest. Now she is an adult. Meatballs’s family sent virus statistics from the New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS) to his tablet. He would stop administrators and question them about testing, tracing and, according to Meatballs, their decision to confiscate his masks on a recent cell search. He would suggest ways for them to run a safer prison. A lot of them struck me as pretty sound.</p><p> 肉丸是一个硬化的家伙，但科米德，隐形敌人，折磨他;他希望出去看看他从未被称为自由男人的女儿。她被捕后两个月出生。现在她是成年人。 Meatballs的家庭向他的平板电脑发送了纽约修正和社区监督部（DOCCS）的病毒统计。他会阻止管理员并质疑他们关于测试，追踪和肉丸的问题，他们决定将他的掩码在最近的细胞搜索中没收。他会建议他们跑步的方法。很多人把我击中了漂亮的声音。</p><p> Ten days into the lockdown, I stopped by my buddy Samuel Goodman’s cell. Sam, who’s serving 10 years for robbery and assault, spent several hours a day doing porter work in the Sullivan infirmary, which was packed with patients who’d tested positive in random tests the prison was conducting. For about $3.75 a week, Sam stepped into a one-piece zip-up suit with a hood, put on an N-95 mask and face guard, then cleaned and mopped and passed out food trays in the four-man rooms housing those who had tested positive. People with worse symptoms stayed in isolation rooms. When Sam threw out the garbage, it went in a hazardous-waste bag.</p><p> 锁定十天进入锁定，我被我的伙伴塞缪尔古德曼的牢房停了下来。萨姆为抢劫和攻击服务10年，每天花费几个小时的时间在沙利文医务室进行搬运工工作，该搬运工在Sullivan医务室工作，这些患者与在监狱正在进行的随机测试中测试正面测试的患者。每周约3.75美元，Sam踏上了一块带有罩的一体式拉链套装，穿上一个N-95面具和面部护罩，然后在四人房间里清理和拖地并通过了食物托盘，住在那些人的四人房间里测试过积极。症状更严重的人居住在孤立的房间里。当山姆扔出垃圾时，它进入了一个危险的废物袋。</p><p> “I look out for guys as much as I can,” Sam told me, legs pretzeled on his bed, a “Star Wars” encyclopedia turned over next to him. Sam is 30 years old, with long auburn hair and a vicious red scar down the side of his face, from when gang members tried to double up on a drug bill and he refused to pay. “I give them extra tea and food and ice,” he said. Sam’s mom, a nurse, died in 2018 while Sam was locked up. She’d have liked that he was doing this work, he told me. He said his neighbor Chucky was now positive and in the infirmary. Sam hadn’t been tested. Though he felt fine, Chucky’s illness didn’t seem like a coincidence.</p><p> “我尽可能多地向伙伴留意，”萨姆告诉我，双腿留在床上，一个“星球大战”百科全书翻过来。山姆是30岁的，长长的赤褐色头发和他脸上的脸上的恶毒红色疤痕，从帮派成员试图加倍毒品法案，他拒绝支付。 “我给了他们额外的茶和食物，”他说。山姆的妈妈是一名护士，在2018年去世时山姆被锁定。他告诉我，她很喜欢他在做这项工作。他说，他的邻居Chucky现在是积极的和在医务室。山姆尚未测试过。虽然他觉得很好，但克鲁克的疾病似乎并不像是巧合。</p><p> I peeked into the empty cell to the right, with its unmade bed. The blanket was crumpled, the sheets wrinkled, barely holding on to the thin plastic mattress.</p><p> 我偷看了右边的空的细胞，用否则的床。毯子被弄皱，薄片皱起了褶皱，几乎没有坚持薄塑料床垫。</p><p> “Loco’s down there, too,” Sam said. This was alarming, because Loco — Johnny Ayala — was 57 and because he liked to cook for Sam and me, using ingredients we bought at the prison commissary or received in the mail. In a plastic hot pot sold at the commissary, Loco did wonders with pepperoni sauce over rigatoni. Serving 32½ years to life for murder and arson, he was admirably active for his age, working a job on the prison maintenance crew. Loco had earlier been placed in quarantine and tested because the correction officer he worked for on the maintenance crew had tested positive. Now he, too, had the coronavirus and was in the infirmary along with Chucky, his symptoms worsening.</p><p> “Loco在那里的地方，”萨姆说。这是令人担忧的，因为Loco  -  Johnny Ayala  - 是57岁，因为他喜欢在监狱委员会的监狱委员或收到的食材烹制Sam和Me。在销售在委员会的塑料火锅中，Loco用辣椒酱对Rigatoni进行了奇观。为谋杀和纵火服务32五岁，他对他的年龄令人钦佩地活跃，在监狱维修机组人员工作。 Loco早些时候被置于检疫并测试，因为他在维护人员工作的修正官员已经测试过积极。现在，他也有冠状病毒，并在医务室和Chucky一起，他的症状恶化。</p><p> I thought about the men who’d be most in danger if there were an outbreak in D North. One was two cells down from Sam: David Brooks, an 81-year-old serving 25 to 50 years for rape. I’d heard that he used to be a musician. He kept to himself, leaving his cell only to grab his food tray from the cart. I didn’t know Old Man Brooks well.</p><p> 如果D North发生疫情，我会想到那些最危险的人。一个是来自山姆的两种细胞：大卫布鲁克斯，一个81岁的人为强奸服务25至50岁。我听说他曾经是一个音乐家。他留着自己，留下他的牢房只抓住他的食物托盘。我不太了解老人的溪。 </p><p> I especially worried about a neighbor named Paul Ford, who was 58 years old, blind and taking medication for diabetes and schizoaffective disorder. (Sullivan houses many prisoners with special needs: hearing impairment, blindness, serious mental illness.) Before lockdown, Paulie could often be found in the common area, swaying in his seat, head tilted upward like Stevie Wonder’s as he mumbled to himself. He wore a black plastic rosary around his neck, its thin string barely holding onto him.</p><p>我特别担心一名名叫保罗福特的邻居，患有58岁，盲人和服用糖尿病和脑血糖症的药物。 （沙利文都拥有许多具有特殊需求的囚犯：听力障碍，失明，严重的精神疾病。）在锁定之前，Paulie通常可以在公共区域找到，在他的座位上摇曳，像他对自己的咕噜声一样向上倾斜。他脖子上穿着黑色塑料念珠，它的薄串几乎没有抓住他。</p><p> Paulie came to Brooklyn from Jamaica as a teenager. In 1980, at age 18, he was trying to steal a car with two friends when an off-duty police officer in his pajamas interrupted. A gunfight erupted, in which a bullet pierced one of Paulie’s eyes, blinding him in both, and another hit the officer in the chest, killing him. Paulie and his co-defendants were all found guilty of murder and attempted robbery. Paulie was sentenced to 26⅓ years to life.</p><p> Paulie从牙买加成为少年的布鲁克林。 1980年，18岁时，当他的睡衣中断时，他试图用两个朋友偷车。枪击爆发，其中一个子弹刺穿了一个Paulie的眼睛，在两者中都致盲，另一个击中了胸部的军官，杀了他。 Paulie和他的共同被告都被判犯有谋杀和企图抢劫罪。保利地区被判处26岁的岁月。</p><p> I had watched others in the cellblock tend to Paulie with a level of care I had never before witnessed in prison. A clerk in the Sullivan law library kept files of Paulie’s paperwork: mental-health reports, parole-hearing minutes. Once, while I was sitting with Paulie, Meatballs brought him a cake.</p><p> 我在手机里看了别人倾向于帕莉，我从未见过监狱以上。 Sullivan Law Library的一名职员保留了Paulie文书工作的文件：心理健康报告，假释听证会分钟。曾经，虽然我和paulie坐在一起，肉丸给他带来了蛋糕。</p><p> Kasiem Chaves, who earned around $7.50 a week as Paulie’s mobility guide, helped Paulie with just about everything: cleaning his cell, communicating, walking. Kasiem had been incarcerated 38 years for a robbery and murder in the Bronx. Now a gangly, graying 65-year-old, he was known at Sullivan as the Old God. It was a reference to his affiliation with the Five-Percent Nation, an offshoot of the Nation of Islam whose members refer to men as “Gods” and women as “Earths.” But I also thought of the nickname as a nod to the thoughtful steadfastness we saw in him.</p><p> Kasiem Chaves每周赚到大约7.50美元，因为Paulie的行动指南帮助Paulie在一切方面的一切：清洗他的细胞，沟通，走路。 KASIEM在布朗克斯抢劫和谋杀案中被监禁了38年。现在是一个GANGLY，灰色65岁，他在沙利文中闻名为旧上帝。这是他与五个百分之五个国家的关系，这是伊斯兰教国家的分支，其成员将男子称为“众神”和妇女为“地球”。但我也想到了绰号，因为我们在他身上看到的周到坚定不移。</p><p> Several times, after Kasiem and Paulie returned from a medicine run, I heard Kasiem arguing with the pantry servers because they’d forgotten to put aside a tray. He’d hustle up a cake, heat some water for instant coffee and serve it to Paulie. Kasiem tried hard to follow physical distancing guidelines, because he saw himself as responsible not only for his own life but also for Paulie’s. In early February, Paulie was supposed to go before a parole panel for the ninth time, to determine whether, after more than 40 years of being locked up, he’d be allowed to leave. Given the pandemic, Kasiem thought Paulie might get his chance. Kasiem, scheduled to see a parole board for the first time in March, was hoping he’d get his chance, too.</p><p> 几次，在Kasiem和Paulie之后从药物运行返回后，我听到了Kasiem与Pantry服务器争论，因为他们被遗忘放在托盘上。他匆匆拍了一块蛋糕，加热一些水，速溶咖啡，并为paulie提供服务。 Kasiem努力努力遵循身体疏远的准则，因为他认为自己是负责他自己的生命，也是为了Paulie的负责。在2月初，Paulie应该在第九次被假释面板之前去，以确定经过40多年的被锁定后，他被允许离开。鉴于大流行，Kasiem认为Paulie可能会机会。 Kasiem，计划在三月首次看到假释板，希望他也能获得他的机会。</p><p> In prison, everything that happens feels like part of our punishment. Over the last year, that has included living through a pandemic while behind bars. Critics of New York’s vaccination plan point out that prisoners are already being punished for our crimes with incarceration — none of us were sentenced to be at extra risk during a pandemic too.</p><p> 在监狱中，发生的一切都感觉就像我们惩罚的一部分。在去年，其中包括在酒吧后面通过大流行生活。纽约的疫苗接种计划的批评者指出，囚犯已被监禁，我们的罪行已经受到监禁 - 我们均未被判处大流行病的风险。</p><p> As the lawyer and human rights advocate Bryan Stevenson has written, we are “more than the worst thing we’ve ever done.” That’s the ideal. Yet the worst thing we’ve done is part of us, too; we are the sum of all our deeds. I murdered a man, and I sometimes feel that the act did diminish the value of my own life. I sometimes feel that I am less deserving of the vaccine than an innocent person.</p><p> 随着律师和人权倡导者，布莱恩史蒂文森已经写了，我们“比我们曾经做过的最糟糕的事情”。这是理想的。然而，我们所做的最糟糕的事情也是我们的一部分;我们是我们所有行为的总和。我谋杀了一个男人，我有时会觉得这一行为确实减少了我自己生活的价值。我有时会觉得我不太值得疫苗而不是无辜的人。 </p><p> I called my mom in Fort Lauderdale and told her, over a phone handset that reeked of bleach and burned my nostrils, about the state government’s decision not to offer us the vaccine. “I can get it,” Mom told me. “I don’t want it. I wish I could give it to you. I’m not productive anymore. I’m shot.” Mom said she doesn’t trust the vaccine, anyway — she thinks they injected water into Joe Biden’s arm: “Ha, I sound like a nut, right?”</p><p>我在劳德代尔堡打电话给我妈妈，并告诉她，通过电话手机，漂白漂白并烧掉了我的鼻孔，关于国家政府的决定不为我们提供疫苗。 “我可以得到它，”妈妈告诉我。 “我不想要它。我希望我能把它给你。我不再富有成效了。我拍了。“妈妈说她不相信疫苗，无论如何 - 她认为他们将水注射到Joe Biden的手臂：“哈，我听起来像坚果，对吧？”</p><p> Mom’s Parkinson’s has robbed her of aging gracefully. She falls, urinates on herself. My older siblings had a different father, and they resented my mom for leaving them with him. She married my father, had me. Then he left her, and we wound up in a housing project. My father later took his own life. In 2001, when I was selling drugs, I shot and killed a man in Brooklyn and was sentenced to 25 years to life for murder, plus three years for drug sales and possessing a gun. One of my brothers died a decade later of an overdose. Now Mom is alone.</p><p> 妈妈的帕金森已经抢劫了她的老化。她摔倒，小便自己。我的兄弟姐妹有一个不同的父亲，他们对我的妈妈们带着他留下来。她娶了我父亲，让我有。然后他离开了她，我们在住房项目中伤了起来。我的父亲后来他自己的生命。 2001年，当我销售毒品时，我在布鲁克林杀死了一个男人，被判处了25岁，谋杀谋杀，加上三年的药物销售和拥有枪支。我的一位兄弟们在过量服用之后死了十年。现在妈妈独自一人。</p><p>  The hardest part of my punishment is that it’s also Mom’s punishment. I’ve felt it acutely these last several months, unable to be there for her when she needs me most. I’ve been having the same conversations with my mom that many other sons and daughters have had with their aging, sometimes stubborn parents: “Make sure your home health aides wear masks and wash their hands, and make sure they don’t touch you.” But how can I be certain my mother will do anything I ask her to do from in here?</p><p>  我惩罚的最难部分是它也是妈妈的惩罚。在过去的几个月里，我觉得这令人痛心，当她最需要我时，他们无法在她身边。我和妈妈一起对待了许多其他儿女的谈话，有时顽固的父母：“确保你的家庭健康助手戴上面具并洗手，并确保他们不接触你。“但是，我怎样才能确定我的母亲会做任何我要求她在这里做的事情吗？</p><p> I told Mom I wanted her to take the vaccine. She said she wouldn’t wait in line for it, but if they brought it to her on a platter, she’d think about it. She told me her younger sister, Mary Ann — my Trump-loving aunt — wasn’t taking it. I looked at the clock and realized that I had seven minutes left of my hour. I needed a shower. “I have to go,” I said. “Don’t listen to Mary Ann!”</p><p> 我告诉妈妈，我希望她参加疫苗。她说她不会排队等待，但如果他们把它带到她的拼盘上，她会想到它。她告诉我她的妹妹，玛丽安 - 我的特朗普爱姨妈 - 没有服用它。我看着时钟，意识到，我小时离开了七分钟。我需要淋浴。 “我得走了，”我说。 “不要听玛丽安！”</p><p>  On Jan. 29, I heard about six D North men whose tests had come back positive. (DOCCS did not comment on specific prisoners’ medical situations, including individual test results.) Old Man Brooks, two cells down from Sam, was one of them. “D North is on quarantine,” crackled over a walkie-talkie on an officer’s hip. “Lock it down!”</p><p>  1月29日，我听说过六个D北男性，其测试已经回来了积极。 （DOCCS对特定囚犯的医疗情况没有评论，包括个人测试结果。）老人Brooks，来自Sam的两个细胞，是其中之一。 “D North是在隔离中，”在官员的臀部上的拐杖噼啪作响。 “把它锁定！”</p><p> A mess-hall worker started leaving a cart with premade trays just inside the cell block’s gate, the way you might leave soup and groceries on the stoop of an infected loved one’s home. Each morning and afternoon, a weary nurse, wearing a purple mask and a panic button clipped to her scrubs, stopped by every cell, stuck a temperature gun through the bars and swiped our foreheads as we leaned forward. An officer with a clipboard recorded the temperatures.</p><p> 一位混乱的霍尔工作人员开始留下电动托盘的推车，在细胞块的门内，你可能会在被感染的爱人的家的弯腰上留下汤和杂货的方式。每天早上和下午，疲惫的护士，穿着紫色面具和恐慌的按钮夹在她的磨砂膏上，被每个细胞停下来，透过酒吧堵住了温度枪，然后在我们向前倾斜时刷到我们的额头。一名官员剪贴板记录了温度。</p><p> My neighbor was not pleased. “Somebody’s a superspreader!” he shouted. He wondered aloud how Old Man Brooks, who seemed never to leave his cell without a mask on, had contracted the virus. “Goddamn superspreader, where’s he at? It’s that Napoleon Dynamite white boy working the clinic!”</p><p> 我的邻居不高兴。 “有人是一个超级普拉斯！”他喊道。他大声想知道，似乎从未在没有面具的情况下似乎永远不会离开他的牢房的人，已经签约了病毒。 “Goddamn Superspreader，他在哪里？这是拿破仑炸药白人男孩工作诊所！“ </p><p>  It was true that a cluster of positives was turning up near Sam’s cell. Two of the steady D North officers had tested positive, too, and were out sick. Sam still hadn’t been tested, but people were becoming suspicious and bad-tempered: Meatballs warned Sam to stay on his side of the block.</p><p>确实，一群积极的群体正在萨姆的牢房附近。两个稳定的北官也经过了积极的测试，并生病了。山姆仍然没有被测试过，但人们变得可疑和脾气暴躁：肉丸警告山姆留在街区。</p><p> “What am I supposed to do?” Sam murmured through his mask, stopping by to see me. “Tell them down at the clinic, ‘Everyone back in the block thinks I’m a superspreader because I work down here, so you guys should test me’?”</p><p> “我应该做些什么？”山姆通过他的面具嘀咕着，停止看我。 “告诉他们在诊所，'每个人都回到街区认为我是一个超级普拉斯，因为我在这里工作，所以你们应该测试我'？”</p><p> But it was too late for that. The quarantine included Sam, who could no longer go to work at the infirmary. The fact that he hadn’t been regularly tested, let alone offered the vaccine, seemed to me to reflect a broader lapse in officials’ judgment.</p><p> 但为此为时已晚。检疫包括山姆，谁再也不能在医务室工作。他没有经常测试的事实，更不用说似乎在我身上似乎反映了官员判决的更广泛的失误。</p><p> Sam might well have brought the virus from the infirmary to D North, infecting his neighbors and the C.O.s on the block, who in turn might have passed it to others when they went home. Still, as Meatballs pointed out, all visits had been canceled for weeks, and we were locked down. Even if Sam had carried the virus from the infirmary to our block, the people coming from the outside to work at Sullivan were most likely to have brought it into the facility in the first place.</p><p> Sam可能会带来病毒从医务室到D North，感染他的邻居和C.O.S在街区上，当他们回家时可能已经把它传递给别人。仍然是肉丸所指出的，所有访问都被取消了几周，我们被锁定了。即使SAM从医务室携带病毒到我们的街区，来自外面的人在Sullivan上工作的人最有可能在第一位置将其带入该设施。</p><p> Locked in all day, I felt depression coming on. My mattress is this plastic three-inch thing that sags in the middle. (DOCCS says prison mattresses are four inches thick when they’re issued.) I’d flip it, smack it, but there was no hope. I made the bed in the morning and tried not to sit on it. I missed the yard, working out in the weight pit with my pal Simon, then lapping the yard’s perimeter and chatting. Simon Dedaj is a charismatic 57-year-old Albanian-American mobster doing 50 years to life for a double murder. (He maintains he didn’t commit the murders.) He has gray hair and dark eyes that shine when he smiles, and he listens to me with genuine interest. I was trying to start a daily exercise regimen in the cell, and I’d hear Simon in my head telling me to just do it. I’d get through a few stretches and free squats, lie on the floor, feel my back crack, breathe. It wasn’t the same.</p><p> 我一整天都锁着，我觉得沮丧了。我的床垫是这种塑料三英寸的东西，在中间落下。 （Doccs说，当签发时，监狱床垫有4英寸厚。）我会翻过来，咂嘴，但没有希望。我早上睡了，试图不要坐在它上面。我错过了院子，用我的Pal Simon在体重坑里锻炼，然后拍打院子里的周边和聊天。 Simon Dedaj是一个有魅力的57岁的阿尔巴尼亚美孚Mobster，为一个双重谋杀案做了50岁。 （他坚持他没有犯谋杀案。）他有灰色的头发和黑暗的眼睛，当他微笑时闪耀，他用真正的兴趣听我。我试图在细胞中开始每日锻炼方案，我听到了我的脑海里的西蒙告诉我只是这样做。我通过一些伸展和自由蹲，躺在地板上，感受到我的背裂，呼吸。这不一样。</p><p> People in prison use the word “bugout” to refer to those with serious mental illness. Kasiem wondered if we could prevent our own crackup by staying vigilant with our studies, being creative, exercising. Most of all, I think Kasiem’s work with Paulie kept him sane, gave him meaning.</p><p> 监狱里的人使用“超出宣传路线”这个词来提到那些具有严重精神疾病的人。 Kasiem想知道我们是否可以通过与我们的学习保持警惕来防止我们自己的脆弱，创造性，锻炼。最重要的是，我认为Kasiem与Paulie的工作让他保持理智，给了他的意思。</p><p> Each morning, I’d still be in bed, and I’d see Kasiem’s shell-toe Adidas glide past my cell. With a hand broom and a cardboard scoop, he’d sweep the cigarette ashes from Paulie’s floor. Then the Old God would kneel at Paulie’s feet and help him tie his laces. Lately, after Kasiem returned to his own cell, Paulie would be back under the covers, wearing state-issued greens — pants, a sweatshirt with cigarette-burned holes — and seeming lethargic. Juice cups and a few half-used rolls of toilet tissue littered his desk. Some of us suspected he had Covid, though a test had come back negative.</p><p> 每天早上，我仍然在床上，我会看到Kasiem的贝壳脚趾阿迪达斯在我的手机上滑过。用手扫帚和纸板舀，他会从Paulie的地板上扫过香烟灰烬。然后老上帝会跪在保罗的脚下，帮助他绑他的鞋带。最近，在Kasiem返回他自己的细胞后，Paulie将回到盖子下，穿着国有发行的蔬菜 - 裤子，带卷烟洞的运动衫 - 看似昏昏欲睡。果汁杯和几卷半二手卫生巾卷在他的办公桌上乱扔垃圾。我们有些人怀疑他有Covid，虽然考试已经回来了消极。 </p><p> One of my neighbors called the porter. The porter, swinging a mop, was half-deaf. He couldn’t hear my neighbor, or was ignoring him, so my neighbor kept calling. “Abdullah. Abdullah. Abdullah! Abduuullah!” I ground my teeth and fantasized about punching his face. Perhaps many of you have had these thoughts, if maybe not as intense, about those with whom you’ve been cooped up. In prison, you can’t escape it. Voices tumble through your bars: chatter, laughter, disinformation.</p><p>我的一个邻居称为搬运工。摆动拖把的搬运工是半聋。他听不到我的邻居，还是忽略了他，所以我邻居呼召。 “阿卜杜拉。阿卜杜拉。阿卜杜拉！ abduuulah！“我碰到了我的牙齿，幻想着猛击他的脸。也许很多人都有这些想法，如果可能不如你已经被融资的那些人。在监狱里，你无法逃脱它。声音通过你的酒吧翻滚：喋喋不休，笑声，伪造。</p><p> “The Cober is like a game of foosball, with all the strains — every step you take, you’re getting hit,” Meatballs said.</p><p> “COOM就像一场桌上球的游戏，所有的菌株 - 你所采取的每一步，你都被击中了，”肉丸说。</p><p>  “I heard the O blood types don’t get it,” a voice chimed in.</p><p>  “我听到o血液类型没有得到它，”一个声音闪闪发光。</p><p>  “Every move you make, I’ll be watching you,” the singer continued.</p><p>  “每一个动作，我会看着你，”歌手继续。</p><p> Loco returned on Feb. 1, his face sunken. “I felt like something was squeezing my insides,” he told me. He bent over and put his hands on his knees. “Look at me, I can’t catch my breath,” he said. He’d lost 20 pounds since I last saw him. I a</p><p> Loco于2月1日返回，他的脸沉没。 “我觉得有些东西正在挤压我的内部，”他告诉我。他弯下腰​​，把手放在膝盖上。 “看着我，我不能喘不过气来，”他说。自从我上次见到他以来，他已经失去了20磅。我是</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/06/magazine/prison-covid.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/06/magazine/prison-covid.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/流行/">#流行</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/pandemic/">#pandemic</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/监狱/">#监狱</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
