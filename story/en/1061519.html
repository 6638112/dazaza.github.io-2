One day she locked the door and went away never to return. When we visited the place couple of years ago, the easiest way to get there was to drive to the closest village, then proceed by foot. We had to pass through some fields, then through a forest. Finally, we&#39;ve descended into a swampy gorge overgrown with vegetation. The path was barely passable. Blackberries and nettles were growing everywhere. We&#39;ve walked down along the stream. We&#39;ve passed the cellars, carved into soft tuff rock, that once belonged to the farm. Now they were empty, with no doors and half-filled with water. Then we have arrived at the farm itself. The stone-and-adobe walls were reduced to almost nothing. You could see them sticking out of the thicket here and there and that was it. Eerily, in this country without people, there was an improvised goat shed built out of sticks and plastic foil among the weed, leaning against the remnant of a wall. There were no goats, nor people, to be seen though.</p><p>在1950年底＆＃39;我的曾祖母是家庭农场的最后居民。有一天，她锁门了，离开永远不会回来。当我们访问几年前的地方时，最容易到达最近的村庄的最简单方法，然后步行。我们必须通过一些领域，然后通过森林。最后，我们＆＃39; ve Deached进入了植被的沼泽峡谷。路径几乎无法通过。黑莓和荨麻在任何地方都在增长。我们沿着溪流走下去。我们通过了酒窖，雕刻成柔软的凝灰岩，曾经属于农场。现在他们是空的，没有门和半充满水。然后我们已经到了农场本身。石头和Adobe墙壁几乎没有。你可以看到它们在这里和那里伸出丛林而且就是这样。在没有人的这个国家，在这个国家，有一个简易山羊棚，在杂草中脱掉棍子和塑料箔，靠在墙上的残余。虽然没有山羊，也没有人。</p><p> I&#39;ve always considered this part of Slovakia, stretching roughly from the town of Krupina towards Veľký Krtíš and Lučenec, to be an enchanted land. It is wild and mostly empty, with hard-to-access depopulated villages and small farms all over the place. If you travel to the area you will experience a genuine post-apocalyptic feeling. Everything is seemingly falling apart. Nature is taking over. Unemployment rate is around 30%. The region has the highest support for neo-Nazi parties in the country.</p><p> 我一直认为斯洛伐克这一部分，粗略地伸展到VeëkýKrtíš和路德的克鲁普镇。它是狂野的，大多是空的，难以访问的村庄和小农场到处。如果您前往该地区，您将体验到真正的世界末日的感觉。一切似乎都崩溃了。自然接管了。失业率约为30％。该地区对该国新纳粹派对的最高支持。</p><p> I never knew much about the history of the region and it was just by a coincidence that I&#39;ve stumbled upon an interview with a person who wrote a study about what happened to this once populous and prosperous region in the second half XIX. and the first half of XX. century.</p><p> 我从来不知道该地区的历史，这只是一个巧合的是，我偶然发现了与一个关于在下半场XIX中曾经有关于这一点曾经发生过的人的人的人进行了采访。和xx的前半部分。世纪。</p><p> It was so weirdly (but not entirely) reminiscent of some of the problems that developed societies are facing today that I&#39;ll try to recount the story in English to make it available to wider audience.</p><p> 它非常奇怪（但并不完全）让人想起制定社会今天面临的一些问题，即我试图用英语叙述故事，使其可用于更广泛的受众。</p><p> In XIX. century the trend of having a single child took hold among protestants of the historical regions of Novohrad, Hont, Malohont and Gemer. Quite obviously, it was a measure against getting impoverished by splitting the family property. However, that can&#39;t possibly be the full explanation. First, catholics faced pretty much the same economic pressures and yet they&#39;ve survived unscathed. Second, the situation wasn&#39;t that different in other parts of the country but the trend of having one child haven&#39;t occurred elsewhere until much later in XX. century.</p><p> 在XIX。世纪拥有一个孩子的趋势在诺科德，霍恩，马洛登和宝石历史地区的新教徒中举行。很明显，通过分裂家庭物业，这是一种措施防止贫困。但是，可以＆＃39; t可能是完整的解释。首先，天主教徒面临着相同的经济压力，但它们尚未受到伤害。其次，这种情况不存在于国家的其他地区，但在XX的其他地方发生了一个孩子的趋势。世纪。</p><p> In fact, the reason of the trend is not known. If you ask me, it could very well be just been few families getting rich by retaining and merging their properties and everyone else mimicking them.</p><p> 事实上，趋势的原因尚不清楚。如果你问我，刚刚通过保留和合并他们的房产和融合他们的所有人来赚很少的家庭。</p><p> Anyway, it seems that if you had multiple kids back then you&#39;ve got criticized and laughed at by your friends and neighbors. It may have been a sentiment similar to the one you can hear voiced about Slovak Roma communities today: &#34;Oh, they are so unruly! They have no restraint! They are so poor and yet have so many kids!&#34; except that it was targeted on the ingroup instead of an outgroup. In short, the whole thing was propelled by peer pressure rather than by an explicit policy.</p><p> 无论如何，似乎如果你有多个孩子回来你＆＃39;曾经被你的朋友和邻居嘲笑。它可能是一个类似于您可以听到关于斯洛伐克罗马社区的声音的情绪：＆＃34;哦，他们是如此不守恒！他们没有克制！他们太穷了，还有很多孩子！＆＃34;除了它是针对InGroup而不是一个小组。简而言之，整个事情被同伴的压力推动而不是明确的政策。 </p><p> In the end, the only sanctioned way to have a second child was when the first one died.</p><p>最后，有第二个孩子的唯一制裁方式是第一个死亡的时候。</p><p> And the system have worked nicely for the first and the second generation. Families grew richer. Farms were consolidated. Living conditions improved. Old wooden buildings were replaced by new houses made of stone. More rooms were added. Plaster decorations and art nouveau elements appeared. Everyone wanted to show off.</p><p> 该系统为第一代和第二代和第二代工作得很好。家庭变得更加丰富。农场被整合。生活条件改善了。老木制建筑被用石头制成的新房子所取代。更多的房间增加了。膏药装饰和艺术的艺术元素出现了。每个人都想炫耀。</p><p> But the progress came at a cost. Sexual abstinence brought in the familiar zoo of weird behaviors, ranging from coitus interruptus to having sex with animals. It was typically the oldest woman in the household who was charged with enforcement of the abstinence and so the strange custom of daughter-in-law sleeping with mother-in-law emerged. The interview mentions a wide range of magical rituals aimed at preventing conception. More importantly though, unwanted pregnancies were solved by amateurishly done abortions that have often left the woman with serious health issues or even led to infertility or death. I don&#39;t enjoy pointless cruelty so I&#39;m not going to go into the details of the procedures that were used at the time.</p><p> 但进展以成本为本。性禁欲在奇怪的行为中带来了熟悉的动物园，从Coitus Irrentuptus与动物发生性关系。这通常是家庭中最古老的女人被指控执行禁欲，因此与婆婆出现了媳妇的奇怪习俗。面谈提到了广泛的魔法仪式，旨在预防概念。更重要的是，不需要的妊娠通过业余正常的堕胎来解决，这些堕胎通常让女性具有严重的健康问题，甚至导致不孕症或死亡。我不喜欢毫无意义的残忍，所以我不会进入当时使用的程序的细节。</p><p> The custom of having a single child survived even in the face of the risk of the child dying. And the children did die. The child mortality in XIX. century was high. If the child died and the parents were too old to have a new kid, or if the woman was rendered infertile by previous abortions, the family died out. Their names were preserved in the names of places where the family farm once stood, but as the region gets even more depopulated and remaining houses are bought by holidaymakers, even those faint memories gradually disappear.</p><p> 甚至面对儿童死亡的风险，让一个孩子的习俗幸存下来。孩子们确实死了。 XIX的儿童死亡率。世纪很高。如果孩子死亡，父母太老了，不能有一个新的孩子，或者如果女人被以前的堕胎所呈现不孕，那么这个家庭就会消失。他们的名字被保留在家庭农场曾经站立的地方的名字中，但由于该地区甚至更加贫穷，并且度假者购买了更多的房屋，即使那些淡淡的记忆逐渐消失。</p><p> That was not the only problem though. The farms grew enormous. People hadn&#39;t the strength to take care of them. While there are still old houses in good condition in other regions of Slovakia, in the regions with one child system the people resigned at maintaining them. The houses were abandoned, left to the mercy of weather and they gradually decayed. So did the yards. Fields were left uncultivated, overtaken be weed. Entire farms turned into a wasteland. There was nobody left to care.</p><p> 这不是唯一的问题。农场成长巨大。人们哈丁＆＃39;它照顾他们的力量。虽然在斯洛伐克的其他地区仍然存在良好的房屋，但在一个儿童系统的地区，人们辞职的人辞职。房子被遗弃，留下了天气的怜悯，他们逐渐衰变。码头也是如此。田地留下了未开垦的，被掀起了杂草。整个农场都变成了荒地。没有人留下关心。</p><p>  Having the protestant work ethic, people were reluctant to give up. They&#39;ve tried to keep up but there wasn&#39;t enough labor available. With decrease in population hiring loborers to work in fields became ever more expensive. Children were overworked from a very young age. People in their twenties looked like forty-somethings. They&#39;ve drank to escape the reality. Combined with the health issues caused by botched abortions it seems to have led to an extremely tiring and mirthless life. One contemporary author writes: &#34;At the fair in Rimavská Seč I&#39;ve observed young women, barely 22 years old, floundering around like mummies. Not one of them ever smiles.&#34;</p><p>  拥有新教的劳动道德，人们不愿意放弃。他们试图跟上但是有足够的劳动力，他们试图跟上。随着雇用LoBorers的人口减少，在田地里工作变得更加昂贵。孩子们从一个非常年轻的时代过度劳累。他们二十几岁的人看起来像是四十多个。他们＆＃39; ve喝了逃避现实。结合拙劣的堕胎造成的健康问题，它似乎导致了极其疲倦和无聊的生活。一个当代作者写道：＆＃34;在rimavskásečičičičič9; ve观察到的年轻女性，几乎没有22岁，像木乃伊一样挣扎。不是他们中的一个笑了。＆＃34;</p><p> Decrease in population led to shortage of partners. While it was inconceivable before for a protestant girl to get a catholic husband, suddenly it became an option. Things that were unthinkable before became inevitable. It even happened sometimes that a rich girl married a manual laborer at the farm. That have in turn, strangely, led to emancipation of women. The property was owned by the wife and all important decisions were done by her. The husband acted only as a front.</p><p> 人口减少导致了合作伙伴的短缺。虽然这是一个令人难以置信的女性女孩来获得天主教丈夫，但它突然变成了一个选择。在不可避免的事情之前是不可想象的。它甚至发生了有时候，一个富有的女孩在农场结婚了一名手工制造者。这又奇怪地导致了妇女的解放。该物业由妻子拥有，所有重要决策都是由她所做的。丈夫只是一个正面。 </p><p> Although child marriages were generally frowned at the shortage of potential partners led to a race of securing a (preferrably rich) spouse as soon as possible. Often, girls as old as 13 or 14 were wed to boys of 17 or 18. That have led to unhappy marriages, psychological problems and, again, excessive drinking.</p><p>虽然儿童婚姻通常在潜在的合作伙伴短缺中皱起眉头，但在尽快担任一场（更优选的富人）配偶的比赛。通常，旧的女孩是13或14的女孩曾与17或18日的男孩结婚。这导致了不快乐的婚姻，心理问题，再次过度饮酒。</p><p> The evidence from archives and newspapers points at yet another phenomenon: Young people at the time were beginning to have sex before marriage. This is still the same strict protestant community and yet it seems that they were encouraged by their parents: &#34;They are the only children. They can do whatever they want.&#34;</p><p> 来自档案和报纸的证据表明另一个现象：当时的年轻人开始在婚前发生性行为。这仍然是严格的新教徒社区，但似乎他们被父母鼓励：＆＃34;他们是唯一的孩子。他们可以做任何他们想要的事情。＆＃34;</p><p> More unforeseen consequences: Protestants in Slovakia were, on average, better educated and more forward-looking than the catholics. To give one example, the leaders of nationalist movement of 1848 came mostly from the milieu of the protestant clergy. (Being a nationalist in 1848 counted as progressive!) However, in the regions with single child system it was the catholics who could afford the luxury of sending some of the kids to school and still have some who stayed at home and worked at the farm. If, on the other hand, a single protestant child left it was a tragedy and it often resulted in the family dying out.</p><p> 更不可预见的后果：斯洛伐克的新教徒平均，比天主教徒更好地接受教育和前瞻性。为了举一个例子，1848年民族主义运动的领导者主要来自新教神职人员的Milieu。 （作为一个民族主义者，1848年被计算为进步！）然而，在单一儿童系统的地区，它是奢侈品的天主教徒，他们能够向学校发送一些孩子，仍有一些人在家里呆在家里并在农场工作。另一方面，如果单一的新教儿童离开它是一个悲剧，它经常导致家庭消失。</p><p> The trend continued after the dissolution of Austria-Hungary and establishment of first Czechoslovak republic. In 1929, contemporary author writes: &#34;And this plague is eating away Slovak protestants more and more, and especially in the places where people are richer. During agrarian reform people got forests, grazing lands and meadows. They are still working hard to get even more earthly possessions but they don&#39;t want to have children. In one house there is a single kid, a boy. In another one, there&#39;s yet another single kid, a girl. Big farmers both. They marry those young people and then only one house remains, only one family to die out.&#34;</p><p> 奥地利匈牙利解散并建立了第一届捷克斯洛伐克共和国的趋势继续。 1929年，当代作者写道：＆＃34;这瘟疫正在越来越多地吃斯洛伐克的斯洛伐克语，特别是在人们更丰富的地方。在农村改革期间，人们得到了森林，吃草土地和草地。他们仍在努力获得更多地上的财产，但他们不想有孩子。在一所房子里，有一个孩子，一个男孩。在另一个，那里＆＃39;又是另一个孩子，一个女孩。大农民都。他们嫁给那些年轻人，然后只有一个房子仍然，只有一个家庭死去。＆＃34;</p><p> It should be said that there was an attempt by protestant intelligentsia to fight this trend. They&#39;ve proposed to tax the families with one child or without children. It was even proposed to cede the property of the childless couples, after their death, to the state. But there was a problem there: The families of government officials had, as a norm, one child. They would never agree to higher taxes. All that being said, even protestant intelligentsia haven&#39;t fared much better. Looking at statistics for protestant priests, it turns out they used to have one child.</p><p> 应该说，纽约人触发抗议者的企图试图战斗这一趋势。他们＆＃39; ve建议将家人纳入一个孩子或没有孩子。甚至建议将无子女夫妇的财产追求，在他们的死亡之后向国家。但那里有一个问题：政府官员的家庭作为一个常态，一个孩子。他们永远不会同意更高的税收。所有这些都被说，甚至是新教徒的知识利亚哈比＆＃39; t比较好。看着新教牧师的统计数据，事实证明他们曾经有一个孩子。</p><p> The original interview can be found  here (in Slovak).
