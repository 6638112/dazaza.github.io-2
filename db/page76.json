The Columbus Dispatch  wrote. With a June 30 deadline looming, Ohio&#39;s House and Senate approved the budget and sent it to Gov. Mike DeWine for final approval on Monday night, the Dispatch wrote.\n  As we wrote  earlier this month, the Ohio Senate approved a version of the budget containing an  amendment that would have forced existing municipal broadband services to shut down and prevented the formation of new public networks. The proposed law was  reportedly &#34;inserted without prior public discussion,&#34; and no state senator publicly sponsored the amendment. It was approved in a party-line vote as Democrats opposed the restrictions in municipal broadband.\n The House version did not contain the amendment, and it was dropped during negotiations between the House and Senate.\n  Lawmakers apparently relented to public pressure from supporters of municipal broadband and cities and towns that operate the networks.\u00a0People and businesses from Fairlawn, where the city-run FairlawnGig network offers fiber Internet, played a significant role in the protests. FairlawnGig itself  asked users to put pressure on lawmakers, and the subscribers did so in great numbers.\n &#34;We had a real grassroots movement here in Fairlawn. We are thrilled our residents, subscribers, and businesses came together and helped us defeat this amendment,&#34; Fairlawn Service Director Ernie Staten said yesterday,  according to an article by\u00a0the Community Networks team at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR). &#34;We appreciate that the State of Ohio recognizes that municipal broadband has a place in this state and we hope to continue this great endeavor.&#34;\n Fairlawn subscribers sent more than 700 emails telling lawmakers, &#34;Don&#39;t take this (municipal broadband) away!&#34; Staten said.\n    The proposed law would have let cities and towns provide broadband service only to unserved areas and used a definition of &#34;unserved&#34; that would reportedly have made over 98 percent of the state ineligible for municipal broadband. The proposed law defined &#34;unserved areas&#34; as those without access to service with download speeds of at least 10Mbps and upload speeds of at least 1Mbps, which isn&#39;t even half as fast as the 25Mbps/3Mbps broadband threshold the Federal Communications Commission  adopted over six years ago.\n  Staten also pointed out that &#34;municipalities only enter the broadband space when forced to by the inaction of the private sector,&#34;  according to the Akron Beacon Journal.\n There are  about 30 public broadband providers in Ohio. Besides Fairlawn, examples of local governments running broadband networks include Hudson, Medina County, and Wadsworth.\u00a0&#34;We&#39;re thrilled that communities like Fairlawn and Hudson can keep serving their communities,&#34; Summit County Executive Ilene Shapiro said after learning that the budget amendment was dropped, according to the Akron Beacon Journal.\n Cleveland City Council President Kevin Kelley previously\u00a0 said the city would sue the state\u00a0if it restricted municipal broadband.\n Until a few months ago,  19 US states had laws restricting municipal broadband, passed for the benefit of private Internet providers that don&#39;t want to face competition from public networks. Washington state lawmakers have since  killed their anti-municipal broadband law, and Arkansas\u00a0 ended many of its restrictions\u00a0on municipal broadband as well.\n  Though it isn&#39;t banning public networks, at least for now, Ohio&#39;s legislature is apparently not letting municipal networks apply for a new round of funding.\n &#34;While Staten celebrated the removal of the budget amendment, he called the victory &#39;bittersweet,&#39; as municipalities and electric cooperatives in the state do not have access to the proposed $250 million broadband expansion grant program that will be established when, and if, Gov. Dewine signs the budget into law,&#34; the ILSR wrote.\n The outcome of that isn&#39;t certain yet. &#34;We have been asking for a small definition change to add municipalities and electric coops, but unless they changed the language, I believe the House version stands,&#34; Staten told the ILSR. But the biggest news is the legislature dropping the plan that would have forced networks to shut down. &#34;Being able to continue [providing service] is much more important,&#34; Staten said.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:53:23", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5171\u548c\u56fd,gop,\u5bbd\u5e26", "title": "\u4fc4\u4ea5\u4fc4\u5dde\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u5728\u62b5\u6297\u5c45\u6c11\u6297\u8bae\u540e\u7981\u6b62\u5e02\u653f\u5bbd\u5e26 ", "title_en": "Ohio GOP ends attempt to ban municipal broadband after protest from residents", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/ohio-gop-ends-attempt-to-ban-municipal-broadband-after-protest-from-residents/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5171\u548c\u56fd", "gop", "\u5bbd\u5e26"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "52fe1b1c0a3112af1c5e229c6f85d4f8.png", "infoid": 1068689, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u66f4\u65b0\uff1aPrivacyShark\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u62a5\u544a\u6b64\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u5df2\u4ece\u4e0b\u9762\u7684LinkedIn\u83b7\u53d6\u4e86\u8bed\u53e5\u3002\n \u636e\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684LinkedInBreac\u533a\u66b4\u9732\u4e86700\u7c73\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8d85\u8fc7756\u4e07\u7528\u6237\u768492\uff05\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u662f\u5728\u6697\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u51fa\u552e\uff0c\u8bb0\u5f55\u5305\u62ec\u7535\u8bdd\u53f7\u7801\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u5730\u5740\uff0c\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6570\u636e\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u5de5\u8d44\u3002\n \u83b7\u5f97\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ed1\u5ba2\u5df2\u53d1\u5e031M\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u68c0\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u65e2\u662f\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u6700\u65b0\u7684...\n  RestorePrivacy\u62a5\u544a\u79f0\uff0c\u9ed1\u5ba2\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6ee5\u7528\u5b98\u65b9LinkedIn API\u4ee5\u4e0b\u8f7d\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u6837\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u57284\u6708\u4efd\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\n 6\u670822\u65e5\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7684\u9ed1\u5ba2\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4ece7\u4ebf\u4e2aLinkedIn\u7528\u6237\u9500\u552e\u5e7f\u544a\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8bba\u575b\u7684\u7528\u6237\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u5305\u542b100\u4e07LinkedIn\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6837\u672c\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u68c0\u67e5\u4e86\u8be5\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u5305\u542b\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4fe1\u606f\uff1a\n  \u6839\u636e\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u68c0\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b83\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u90fd\u662f\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u5e76\u4e0e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7528\u6237\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u8868\u786e\u5b9e\u662f\u6700\u65b0\u7684\uff0c\u6765\u81ea2020\u52302021\u7684\u6837\u672c\u3002\n \u6211\u4eec\u76f4\u63a5\u5411\u7528\u6237\u81f4\u7535\uff0c\u8be5\u7528\u6237\u5728\u9ed1\u5ba2\u8bba\u575b\u4e0a\u53d1\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4ed6\u58f0\u79f0\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528LinkedIn API\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u4eba\u4eec\u4e0a\u4f20\u5230\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u6570\u636e\u3002 \n\u6ca1\u6709\u5305\u542b\u5bc6\u7801\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ad9\u70b9\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u8fd9\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u8eab\u4efd\u76d7\u7a83\u548c\u4ee4\u4eba\u4fe1\u670d\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u9493\u9c7c\u5c1d\u8bd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u81ea\u5df1\u7528\u4e8e\u83b7\u53d6LinkedIn\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u767b\u5f55\u51ed\u636e\u3002\n \u4f7f\u7528\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\uff0cLinkedIn\u786e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86500M\u8bb0\u5f55\u5305\u62ec\u4ece\u5176\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u58f0\u79f0\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u6e90\u3002 Privacyshark\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u6b64\u65f6\u53d1\u8868\u4e86\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u9648\u8ff0\uff1a\n \u867d\u7136\u6211\u4eec\u4ecd\u5728\u8c03\u67e5\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u62ec\u4eceLinkedIn\u522e\u4e0b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ece\u5176\u4ed6\u6765\u6e90\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0d\u662fLinkedIn\u6570\u636e\u8fdd\u7ea6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u786e\u5b9a\u6ca1\u6709\u66b4\u9732\u79c1\u4ebaLinkedIn\u6210\u5458\u6570\u636e\u3002\u6765\u81eaLinkedIn\u7684\u522e\u64e6\u6570\u636e\u662f\u8fdd\u53cd\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u6761\u6b3e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u65ad\u52aa\u529b\u786e\u4fdd\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4f1a\u5458\u9690\u79c1\u53d7\u5230\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002\n \u67d0\u4eba\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u591f\u522e\u767e\u4e07\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u4f7f\u7528API\u200b\u200b\u8fd8\u662f\u5176\u4ed6\uff0c\u8fd9\u7edd\u5bf9\u662f\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e......\n  \u60a8\u6b63\u5728\u9605\u8bfb9To5MAC  -

The database is for sale on the dark web, with records including phone numbers, physical addresses, geolocation data, and inferred salaries.\n The hacker who obtained the data has posted a sample of 1M records, and checks confirm that the data is both genuine and up-to-date \u2026\n  RestorePrivacy reports that the hacker appears to have misused the official LinkedIn API to download the data, the same method used in  a similar breach back in April.\n On June 22nd, a user of a popular hacker advertised data from 700 Million LinkedIn users for sale. The user of the forum posted up a sample of the data that includes 1 million LinkedIn users. We examined the sample and found it to contain the following information:\n  Based on our analysis and cross-checking data from the sample with other publicly available information, it appears all data is authentic and tied to real users. Additionally, the data does appear to be up to date, with samples from 2020 to 2021.\n We reached out directly to the user who is posting the data up for sale on the hacking forum. He claims the data was obtained by exploiting the LinkedIn API to harvest information that people upload to the site.\n No passwords are included, but as the site notes, this is still valuable data that can be used for identity theft and convincing-looking phishing attempts that can themselves be used to obtain login credentials for LinkedIn and other sites.\n With the previous breach, LinkedIn did confirm that the 500M records included data obtained from its servers, but claimed that more than one source was used.  PrivacyShark notes that the company has issued a similar statement this time:\n While we\u2019re still investigating this issue, our initial analysis indicates that the dataset includes information scraped from LinkedIn as well as information obtained from other sources. This was not a LinkedIn data breach and our investigation has determined that no private LinkedIn member data was exposed.

Coming in at a $10 billion market capitalization would make SentinelOne the most valuable cybersecurity IPO to date.\n A source said that the road show has been stronger than anticipated, in part because of the strength of one of its competitors, CrowdStrike, which is publicly traded and currently sitting at a  market cap of $58 billion.\n  The other reason for the response is a slightly grimmer one: Cybersecurity continues to be a major issue for businesses of all sizes, public organizations, governments and individuals. \u201cNo one wants to see another SolarWinds, and there is no reason that there shouldn\u2019t be more than one or two strong players,\u201d a source said.\n As is the bigger trend in cybersecurity, Israel-hatched, Mountain View-based  SentinelOne\u2018s approach to combat that is artificial intelligence \u2014 and in its case specifically, a machine-learning-based solution that it sells under the brand  Singularity that focuses on endpoint security, working across the entire edge of the network to monitor and secure laptops, phones, containerised applications and the many other devices and services connected to a network.\n Last year, endpoint security solutions were estimated to be around an $8 billion market, and analysts project that it could be worth as much as  $18.4 billion by 2024 \u2014 another reason why SentinelOne may have moved up the timetable on its IPO (last year the company\u2019s CEO Tomer Weingarten had told me he thought the company had one or two years left as a private company before considering an IPO, a timeline it clearly decided was worth speeding up).\n SentinelOne  raised $267 million on a $3.1 billion valuation led by Tiger Global as recently as last November, but it has been expanding rapidly. Growth last quarter was 116% compared to the same period a year before, and it now has more than 4,700 customers and annual recurring revenue of $161 million, according to its  S-1 filing. It is also still not profitable, posting a net loss of $64 million in the last quarter.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:52:33", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

to grow our understanding of the company beyond  our EC-1.\n First, we\u2019ll explore the growth of Duolingo\u2019s total user base, how much money it makes per active user, and how effectively the company has managed to convert free users to paid products over time. The numbers will set us up to understand what else can be learned about Duolingo\u2019s business beyond our original deep dive into the company\u2019s finances \u2014 specifically underscoring the pressure cooker it finds itself in when looking for new revenue sources.\n Starting with  Duolingo\u2019s growth in total active users, guess how fast they rose from 2019 to 2020. Hold that number in your head.\n The actual numbers are as follows: In 2019, Duolingo closed the year with 27.3 million monthly active users (MAUs); it wrapped 2020 with 36.7 million MAUs. That\u2019s a gain of 34%. If we narrow our gaze to Q1 2021 numbers compared to Q1 2020, we can see that Duolingo\u2019s MAUs rose from 33.5 million to 39.9 million, or growth of around 19%.\n  The bulk of Duolingo\u2019s growth, then, came in early 2020 when we consider its pandemic bump. Put more simply, the company scaled from 27.3 million MAUs at the end of 2019 to 33.5 million MAUs at the end of Q1 2020; from then, the company added 3.2 million more MAUs throughout 2020 and 6.4 million during the next four quarters.\n Another lens through which to view the numbers is simply a recognition that first-quarter results at Duolingo appear to be stronger than results in the rest of the year, perhaps due to New Year\u2019s resolutions to learn a new language or brush up on a second language learned in high school.\n Next, let\u2019s examine  Duolingo\u2019s monetization efforts regarding converting free users to paying users.\n Here we can see a very different growth story. While the company\u2019s MAUs rose 34% from 2019 to 2020, the company\u2019s paying users rose from 900,000 at the end of 2019 to 1.6 million at the end of 2020. That is a far-sharper gain of 84% on a year-over-year basis.\n So, while Duolingo did see material user growth during 2020, it saw turbo-charged expansion in the users it was able to shake revenue from. Improved monetization, more than acceleration in user growth, was the pandemic\u2019s effect on Duolingo.\n What can we see in the company\u2019s more recent results? From Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, Duolingo\u2019s paid subscribers rose from 1.1 million to 1.8 million, a gain of around 64%. That was a slower pace than the company managed more generally in 2020, which matches Duolingo\u2019s slower revenue growth in Q1 2021 than it recorded in 2020.\n The number is still strong, we think. But not as impressive as the more than 100% revenue expansion that the company put on the board last year.\n In percentage terms, 3.3% of Duolingo\u2019s MAUs were paid subscribers in 2019. That figure rose to 4.4% in 2020. And in Q1 2021, it reached 4.5%. Duolingo rounds that number to 5% in its S-1, which feels somewhat aggressive to us, given the somewhat modest pace at which the metric is improving. Here\u2019s the wording:\n As of March 31, 2021, approximately 5% of our monthly active users were paid subscribers of Duolingo Plus. Our paid subscriber penetration has increased steadily since we launched Duolingo Plus in 2017 and, combined with our user growth, has led to our revenue more than doubling every year since.\n  Next, let\u2019s chat about  revenue per MAU. To get consistent numbers, we\u2019ll divide quarterly revenues by MAU figures from the same period. So, we\u2019ll compare Q4 2019 revenue at Duolingo with its year-end MAU figure. We\u2019ll do the same for 2020, and for Q1 2021 we\u2019ll use both numbers from that period.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:52:15", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u589e\u957f,depicts,duolingo", "title": "Duolingo\u7684S-1\u63cf\u7ed8\u4e86\u4ee4\u4eba\u6bdb\u9aa8\u609a\u7136\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8d27\u5e01\u5316\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u82f1\u8bed\u8ba4\u8bc1 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tDuolingo\u2019s S-1 depicts heady growth, monetization, new focus on English certification\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/duolingos-s-1-depicts-heady-growth-monetization-new-focus-on-english-certification/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u589e\u957f", "depicts", "duolingo"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1068686, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u4eec\u4f9d\u9760\u60a8\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff1a\u60a8\u662f\u5426\u77e5\u9053\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u6bcf\u67083\u7f8e\u5143\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7684Phoronix\u4fdd\u8d39\uff1f\u4eca\u5929\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5b83\u6765\u67e5\u770b\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e0a\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u9875\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u65e0\u5e7f\u544a\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u867d\u7136\u6536\u76ca\u5141\u8bb8\u6211\u4eec\u7f16\u5199\u66f4\u591a\u7684Linux\u786c\u4ef6\u8bc4\u8bba\u3002 Linus Torvalds\u521a\u521a\u5c06Linux 5.13\u5185\u6838\u53d1\u5e03\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\r   Linux 5.13\u53ea\u662f\u6807\u8bb0\u5e76\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u4e86\u3002\u5185\u6838\u5728\u65b0\u7684\uff06\uff0334\u4e0b\u8fd0\u9001;\u6e38\u884c\uff06\uff0334\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd;\u4e0a\u5468\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u4ee3\u53f7\u3002\r   Linux 5.13\u4e3aApple M1\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6700\u521d\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7136\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u672c\u652f\u6301\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u71a8\u70eb\u524d\u65b9\u7684\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u548c\u66f4\u591a\u3002\u8fd8\u6709\u65b0\u7684Linux 5.13\u5b89\u5168\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5982Landlock LSM\uff0cClang CFI\u652f\u6301\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u9009\u5730\u968f\u610f\u5730\u968f\u673a\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u5185\u6838\u5806\u6808\u504f\u79fb\u91cf\u3002\u8fd8\u6709AMD\u6709\u8da3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u56f4\u7ed5FreeSync HDMI\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u521d\u59cbAldebaran\u4fc3\u9500\u7b49\u7b49\u3002\u82f1\u7279\u5c14\u5728Alder Lake\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u51b7\u5374\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u548c\u66f4\u591a\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u5e26\u4e0a\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002 Linux 5.13\u8fd8\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u66f4\u6539\uff0c\u56f4\u7ed5IO_\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u901a\u7528USB\u663e\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u65b0\u786c\u4ef6\u542f\u7528\u3002\r   \u8bf7\u53c2\u9605Linux 5.13\u6216\u5b8c\u6574\u7684Linux 5.13\u529f\u80fd\u6982\u8ff0\u7684\u9876\u90e8\u529f\u80fd\u3002\r     \u73b0\u5728\u5b83\u4e0eLinux 5.14\u5468\u671f\u548c\uff0339; s\uff06\uff0339;\u5728Linux 5.14\u4e0a\u671f\u5f85\u7740\u8bb8\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u66f4\u65b0\uff1aLinus Torvalds\u73b0\u5df2\u53d1\u5e035.13\u516c\u544a\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u4eec\u81eaRC7\u4ee5\u6765\u4e00\u76f4\u5f88\u5e73\u9759\u7684\u4e00\u5468\uff0c\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6ca1\u6709\u7406\u7531\u5ef6\u8fdf5.13\u3002\u672c\u5468\u7684\u77ed\u8def\u662f\u5c0f\u7684\uff0c\u53ea\u670988\u4e2a\u975e\u5408\u5e76\u63d0\u4ea4\uff08\u548c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e9b\u53ea\u662f\u6062\u590d\uff09......\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4e0a\u5468\u5c0f\u800c\u4e14\u5e73\u9759\uff0c\u603b\u4f535.13\r\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u76f8\u5f53\u5927\u3002\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b83\u548c\uff0339;\uff06\uff0339;\u8f83\u5927\u76845.x\u7248\u672c\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc716k\u7684\u63d0\u4ea4\uff08\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5408\u5e76\u8d85\u8fc717k\uff09\uff0c\u6765\u81ea\u8d85\u8fc72k\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u3002\u4f46\u5b83\uff06\uff0339; s\u4e00\u4e2a\uff06\uff0334;\u5927\u5168\uff06\uff0334;\u4e00\u4ef6\u4e8b\u60c5\uff0c\u4e0d\u662f\u7279\u522b\u7a81\u51fa\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u3002\uff06\uff0334; ", "note_en": "We Rely On Your Support: Did you know that you can get  Phoronix Premium for under $3 per month?

Linus Torvalds has just released the  Linux 5.13 kernel as stable.\r   Linux 5.13 was just  tagged and is ready to go. The kernel is shipping under the new &#34;Opossums on Parade&#34; codename that was put in place last week.\r   Linux 5.13 brings initial but still early support for the Apple M1 with basic support but not yet accelerated graphics and a lot more to iron out moving ahead. There are also new Linux 5.13 security features like the Landlock LSM, Clang CFI support, and optionally randomizing the kernel stack offset at each system call. There is also AMD fun this cycle around FreeSync HDMI support, initial Aldebaran bring-up, and more. Intel has more work on Alder Lake, a new cooling driver, and more discrete graphics bring-up. There are also other changes for Linux 5.13 around faster IO_uring, a generic USB display driver, and other new hardware enablement.\r   See  the top features of Linux 5.13 or the complete  Linux 5.13 feature overview.\r     Now it&#39;s onward to the Linux 5.14 cycle and already  many features to look forward to with Linux 5.14.   Update: Linus Torvalds has now posted his 5.13  announcement, &#34; So we had quite the calm week since rc7, and I see no reason to delay 5.13. The shortlog for the week is tiny, with just 88 non-merge commits (and a few of those are just reverts)...Of course, if the last week was small and calm, 5.13 overall is\ractually fairly large. In fact, it&#39;s one of the bigger 5.x releases, with over 16k commits (over 17k if you count merges), from over 2k developers. But it&#39;s a &#34;big all over&#34; kind of thing, not something particular that stands out as particularly unusual.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:43:43", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "linux,\u53d1\u5e03,apple,released,\u652f\u6301", "title": "Linux 5.13 kernel\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u5305\u62ecApple M1\u652f\u6301\uff0cClang CFI\u548cLineux\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u5757 ", "title_en": "Linux 5.13 Kernel Released, Includes Apple M1 Support, Clang CFI, and Landlock's Linux Security Module", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-5.13-Released", "via": "", "real_tags": ["linux", "\u53d1\u5e03", "apple", "released", "\u652f\u6301"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7e2dd72d1344aaf19b9a913a9227a5c5.jpg", "infoid": 1068685, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u666e\u7f57\u7ef4\u767b\u65af\uff08AP\uff09 - \u5f53\u7f8e\u56fd\u6267\u6cd5\u5b98\u5458\u9700\u8981\u7f29\u5c0f\u51c0\u8d44\u6599\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u8f6c\u5411\u5927\u578b\u6280\u672f\u516c\u53f8\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u5e9e\u5927\u6570\u5b57\u6c60\u5858\u901a\u8fc7\u5df2\u7ecf\u6302\u94a9\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u670d\u52a1\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5730\u7684\u4eba\u3002\n \u7531\u56db\u4e2a\u6700\u5927\u7684\u6280\u672f\u516c\u53f8\u7f16\u5236\u7684\u6570\u636e\u663e\u793a\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6267\u6cd5\u8bf7\u6c42 - \u7535\u8bdd\uff0c\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\uff0c\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u7167\u7247\uff0c\u8d2d\u7269\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u9a7e\u9a76\u8def\u7ebf\u548c\u66f4\u591a - \u81ea2015\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u6709\u4e24\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u8b66\u65b9\u4e5f\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u7cbe\u660e\u5173\u4e8e\u8986\u76d6\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u66f2\u76ee\uff0c\u4ee5\u514d\u8b66\u60d5\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u3002\n \u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u63ed\u793a\uff06\uff0339\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u662f\uff0c\u7279\u6717\u666e\u65f6\u4ee3\u7f8e\u56fd\u53f8\u6cd5\u90e8\u8981\u6c42\u6765\u81ea\u82f9\u679c\uff0c\u5fae\u8f6f\u548c\u8c37\u6b4c\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5173\u4e8e\u56fd\u4f1a\u6210\u5458\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u52a9\u624b\u548c\u65b0\u95fb\u8bb0\u8005\u5728\u6cc4\u9732\u8c03\u67e5\u4e2d - \u7136\u540e\u8ffd\u6c42\u7981\u6b62\u8fd9\u4e9b\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6cd5\u9662\u547d\u4ee4\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002\n   \u57282020\u5e74\u7684\u4e0a\u534a\u5e74 - \u53ef\u7528\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u6570\u636e -  Apple\uff0cGoogle\uff0cFacebook\u548cMicrosoft\u4e00\u8d77\u5171\u540c\u5f00\u5c55\u4e86\u6765\u81ea\u5f53\u5730\uff0c\u5dde\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5b98\u5458\u7684112,000\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u8bf7\u6c42\u3002\u516c\u53f8\u540c\u610f\u5728\u5176\u4e2d85\uff05\u7684\u6848\u4ef6\u4e2d\u4ea4\u51fa\u4e00\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u3002 Facebook\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5176Instagram\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5360\u62ab\u9732\u6700\u591a\u7684\u62ab\u9732\u3002\n  \u8003\u8651\u7ebd\u6ce2\u7279\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6cbf\u6d77\u57ce\u5e0224,000\u4e2a\u5c45\u6c11\uff0c\u5438\u5f15\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u590f\u5b63\u6e38\u5ba2\u3002\u5c11\u4e8e100\u540d\u519b\u5b98\u5de1\u903b\u57ce\u5e02 - \u4f46\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e3a\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u5468\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u3002\n \u90a3\u4e2a\uff06\uff0339;

", "note_en": "PROVIDENCE\u00a0(AP) \u2014 When U.S. law enforcement officials need to cast a wide net for information, they&#39;re increasingly turning to the vast digital ponds of personal data created by Big Tech companies via the devices and online services that have hooked billions of people around the world.\n Data compiled by four of the biggest tech companies shows that law enforcement requests for user information \u2014 phone calls, emails, texts, photos, shopping histories, driving routes and more \u2014 have more than tripled in the U.S. since 2015. Police are also increasingly savvy about covering their tracks so as not to alert suspects of their interest.\n That&#39;s the backdrop for recent revelations that the Trump-era U.S. Justice Department sought data from Apple, Microsoft and Google about members of Congress, their aides and news reporters in leak investigations \u2014 then pursued court orders that blocked those companies from informing their targets.\n   In just the first half of 2020 \u2014 the most recent data available \u2014 Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft together fielded more than 112,000 data requests from local, state and federal officials. The companies agreed to hand over some data in 85% of those cases. Facebook, including its Instagram service, accounted for the largest number of disclosures.\n  Consider Newport,\u00a0a coastal city of 24,000 residents that attracts a flood of summer tourists. Fewer than 100 officers patrol the city \u2014 but they make multiple requests a week for online data from tech companies.\n That&#39;s because most crimes \u2014 from larceny and financial scams to a recent fatal house party stabbing at a vacation rental booked online \u2014 can be at least partly traced on the internet. Tech providers, especially social media platforms, offer a &#34;treasure trove of information&#34; that can help solve them, said Lt. Robert Salter, a supervising police detective in Newport.\n  &#34;Everything happens on Facebook,&#34; Salter said. &#34;The amount of information you can get from people&#39;s conversations online \u2014 it&#39;s insane.&#34;\n As ordinary people have become increasingly dependent on Big Tech services to help manage their lives, American law enforcement officials have grown far more savvy about technology than they were five or six years ago, said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group.\n  That&#39;s created what Cohn calls &#34;the golden age of government surveillance.&#34; Not only has it become far easier for police to trace the online trails left by suspects, they can also frequently hide their requests by obtaining gag orders from judges and magistrates. Those orders block Big Tech companies from notifying the target of a subpoena or warrant of law enforcement&#39;s interest in their information \u2014 contrary to the companies&#39; stated policies.\n Of course, there&#39;s often a reason for such secrecy, said Andrew Pak, a former federal prosecutor. It helps prevent investigations getting sidetracked because someone learns about it, he said \u2014&#34;the target, perhaps, or someone close to it.&#34;\n Longstanding opposition to such gag orders has recently resurfaced in the wake of the Trump-era orders. Apple in 2018 shared phone and account data generated by two Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee, but the politicians didn&#39;t find out until May, once a series of gag orders expired.\n Microsoft also shared data about a congressional aide and had to wait more than two years before telling that person. Brad Smith, Microsoft&#39;s president, last week called for an end to the overuse of secret gag orders, arguing in a Washington Post opinion piece that &#34;prosecutors too often are exploiting technology to abuse our fundamental freedoms.&#34;\n  Critics like Cohn have called for revision of U.S. surveillance laws drawn up years ago when the police and prosecutors typically had to deliver warrants to the home of the person being targeted for searches. Now that most personal information is kept in the equivalent of vast digital storehouses controlled by Big Tech companies, such searches can proceed in secret.\n &#34;Our surveillance laws are really based on the idea that if something is really important, we store it at home, and that doesn&#39;t pass the giggle test these days,&#34; Cohn said. &#34;It&#39;s just not true.&#34;\n  Many tech companies are quick to point out that the majority of the information they are forced to share is considered &#34;non-content&#34; data. But that can include useful details such as the basic personal details you supply when you register for an account, or the metadata that shows if and when you called or messaged someone, though not what you said to them.\n Law enforcement can also ask tech companies to preserve any data generated by a particular user, which prevents the target from deleting it. Doing so doesn&#39;t require a search warrant or any judicial oversight, said Armin Tadayon, a cybersecurity associate at advisory firm the Brunswick Group.\n If police later find reasonable grounds for conducting a search, they can return with a warrant and seize the preserved data. If not, the provider deletes the copies and &#34;the user likely never finds out,&#34; Tadayon said.\n  In Newport, getting a search warrant for richer online data isn&#39;t that difficult. Salter said it requires a quick trip to a nearby courthouse to seek a judge&#39;s approval; some judges are also available after hours for emergency requests. And if a judge finds there is probable cause to search through online data, tech companies almost always comply.\n &#34;Most of the companies do play ball,&#34; Salter said. &#34;We can speak with people, get questions answered. They&#39;re usually pretty helpful.&#34;\n Nearly all big tech companies \u2014 from Amazon to rental sites like Airbnb, ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft and service providers like Verizon \u2014 now have teams to respond to such requests and regularly publish reports about how much they disclosed. Many say they work to narrow overly broad requests and reject those that aren&#39;t legally valid.\n  Some of the most dramatic increases in requests have been to tech companies that cater to younger people. As the messaging app Snapchat has grown in popularity, so have government requests for its data. Snap, the company behind the app, fielded nearly 17,000 data requests in the first six months of 2020, compared to 762 in the same period of 2015.\n Salter said the fact that we&#39;re all doing so much online means police detectives need to stay tech-savvy. But training courses for how to file such requests aren&#39;t hard to find.\n For those worried about the growing volume of online data sought by law enforcement, Salter said: &#34;Don&#39;t commit crimes and don&#39;t use your computer and phones to do it.&#34;\n &#34;Judges are not going to sign off on something if we don&#39;t have probable cause to go forward,&#34; he said. &#34;We&#39;re not going to look at people&#39;s information without having something to go on.&#34;\n But Cohn said more tech companies should be using encryption technology to make all personal information, including metadata, virtually impossible to decipher without a user key to unlock it.\n Until then, she said, police can short circuit constitutional protections against unreasonable searches &#34;by just going to the company instead of coming directly to us.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:43:19", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u9ec4\u91d1\u65f6\u4ee3,requests", "title": "\u201c\u76d1\u89c6\u7684\u9ec4\u91d1\u65f6\u4ee3\u201d\uff0c\u8b66\u65b9\u57286\u4e2a\u6708\u5185\u63d0\u51fa112,000\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u8981\u6c42 ", "title_en": "'Golden Age of Surveillance', as Police Make 112,000 Data Requests in 6 Months", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.newportri.com/story/news/local/2021/06/27/newport-police-use-big-tech-social-media-aid-investigations/5334035001/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9ec4\u91d1\u65f6\u4ee3", "requests"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "ba188861a0e659785786f8568f21e7d7.jpg", "infoid": 1068684, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Coinbase Ceo Brian Armstrong\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5217\u51fa\u201c\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u201d\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u5b83\u662f\u5408\u6cd5\u7684\u3002\n \u4ed6\u8865\u5145\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u8bba\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5176\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5404\u79cd\u786c\u5e01\u3002\n    Coinbase Ceo Brian Armstrong\u4eca\u5929\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u8ba1\u5212\u5217\u51fa\u6bcf\u4e2a\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e0a\u5141\u8bb8\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\u3002\n \uff06\uff0334;\u63d0\u9192Coinbase\u5982\u4f55\u5217\u51fa\u8d44\u4ea7\uff1a\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5217\u51fa*\u6bcf\u4e2a*\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\u5b83\u662f\u5408\u6cd5\u7684\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u4ed6\u53d1\u4e86\u63a8\u6587\u3002\n \u963f\u59c6\u65af\u7279\u6717\u8865\u5145\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u786c\u5e01\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u7279\u6b8a\u5f85\u9047\u3002 \uff06\uff0334;\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4e0a\u5e02\u6807\u51c6\u4e4b\u5916\uff08\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168/\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5c31\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u63d0\u4f9b\u610f\u89c1\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u662f\u8d44\u4ea7\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u8bba\u8005\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u76f8\u4fe1\u81ea\u7531\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5e94\u8be5\u5728\u5bc6\u7801\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u6211\u4eec\uff06\uff0339;

We are asset agnostic, because we believe in free markets and that consumers should have choice in the cryptoeconomy. This is how we&#39;ll have the most innovation,&#34; he said.\n The CEO suggested that, over time, the exchange will introduce ways for its users to review or rate each asset. In theory, this would be to provide other consumers with information to make more educated decisions, he said.\n The exchange has certainly picked up the pace when it comes to listing new assets. In 2017, the exchange offered just four cryptocurrencies: bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, and bitcoin cash. At the time, a Coinbase listing was a big occasion, often pumping a coin&#39;s price on the announcement that it was coming to the exchange \u2014 something that became known as &#34;The Coinbase Effect.&#34;\n Now the exchange lists 63 cryptocurrencies, from stablecoins like tether (USDT) to well-known coins like cardano (ADA) and even more obscure coins like NKN (NKN), which ranks 166th on CoinMarketCap.\n In January, Coinbase said that it was  considering 44 cryptocurrencies that it may choose to add. It has already added a few of them, including ankr (ANKR), curve (CRV) and skale (SKL). Just three days ago, the exchange added more tokens including barnbridge (BOND), livepeer (LPT) and quant (QNT) to its roster.\n But with thousands more assets out there, it still has a long way to go if it truly wants to list every cryptocurrency.\n   \u00a9 2021 The Block Crypto, Inc.

General counsel Dev Stahlkopf is leaving for the top legal role at another company, a move expected to be announced later on Tuesday.\n  Two of Microsoft&#39;s other top lawyers will add the title of general counsel. Lisa Tanzi will lead a new team that oversees how policies are implemented by engineering and sales teams around the globe, while 23-year Microsoft veteran Hossein Nowbar will be in charge of the corporate legal team, including intellectual proprty,  litigation, compliance, and competition teams.\n Former FTC commissioner and Microsoft chief privacy officer Julie Brill will add oversight of the company&#39;s responsible AI, digital safety, accessibility compliance and regulatory governance efforts.\n Between the lines: While Microsoft spent much of the 2000s fighting with regulators, Smith says this time around Microsoft is working to anticipate and embrace new sets of rules, rather than lead the charge against them.\n Although Microsoft has not been at the top of the list of companies that legislators seek to rein in, Smith said he expects that the company will be significantly affected by the wave of legislation to come.\n &#34;While I think it is easy for people to focus just on antitrust law and just the U.S., what is happening is much bigger and broader than that,&#34; Smith said.\n In the internal memo announcing the reorganization, Smith included a map of countries where new regulation of the tech industry has been proposed. That map has most of the globe colored in.\n  The big picture: Smith said he anticipates the new rules will impact not just Microsoft and other tech companies, but ultimately also their corporate customers, who will be subject to laws covering issues ranging from privacy to AI ethics.\n &#34;This is a sweeping set of changes,&#34; he said. &#34;The wise course in our view is to start to prepare what it takes.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:41:49", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "microsoft,\u5fae\u8f6f,\u4eca\u5e74,grow,axios", "title": "\u5fae\u8f6f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4eca\u5e74\u5c06\u5728\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u589e\u52a0\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u591a\u5e74\u6d6a\u6f6e\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u516c\u53f8\u4e8b\u52a1\u4eba\u5458\u8fbe\u523020\uff05 ", "title_en": "Microsoft says it will grow its legal and corporate affairs staff by 20% this year in anticipation of a multiyear wave of increased tech regulation globally", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.axios.com/microsoft-legal-team-expands-regulation-6bc0d5b9-e4a7-4131-ad4d-8d3030d0d7ab.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["microsoft", "\u5fae\u8f6f", "\u4eca\u5e74", "grow", "axios"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "92460ad72a85980b01b640c4549009f2.png", "infoid": 1068681, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f88\u9ad8\u5174\u5730\u5ba3\u5e03\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u65e0\u5e7f\u544a\u79c1\u4eba\u8ba2\u9605\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002\u6ce8\u518c\u5e76\u514d\u8d39\u83b7\u5f97\u4e09\u4e2a\u6708\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6bcf\u6708\u53ea\u97004.95\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n \u5f53\u524d\u641c\u7d22\u72b6\u6001\u88ab\u6253\u7834\u3002\u4e3b\u6d41\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u4e0d\u518d\u4e3b\u8981\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u5b83\u4eec\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u544a\uff0c\u5c06\u6709\u673a\u641c\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u63a9\u76d6\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u6298\u53e0\u3002\u4ee5\u5584\u610f\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e16\u754c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u826f\u597d\u65b9\u5f0f\u5df2\u7ecf\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u9879\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8d27\u5e01\u5316\u70b9\u51fb\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5e7f\u544a\u5546\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u4e1a\u52a1\u3002\n NEEVA\u662f\u641c\u7d22Reimagined  -

And by connecting Neeva to email accounts, calendars, and cloud storage platforms, users can surface information that is most valuable to them without sacrificing privacy.\n Moreover, we support the content ecosystem. Rather than being a toll collector for the web\u2019s content, we are strongly pro-publisher and are committed to creating revenue opportunities for content creators. We will share at least 20% of our topline revenue with content creator partners when their content is used to directly answer a Neeva user\u2019s query.\n \u201cNeeva was built on the premise that search should focus on the consumer, and only the consumer, not advertisers,\u201d said Sridhar Ramaswamy, CEO, and Co-Founder, Neeva. \u201cSearch results should always prioritize finding the best answer to a consumer\u2019s query \u2014 not on selling ads or tracking behavior online. Today\u2019s launch of our subscription-based model is the first step in providing a viable search alternative for consumers, built on trust and transparency.\n We put the user at the center of everything. From online shopping to searching old emails, every feature is designed with the user in mind.\n Ad-free: Up to 40% of search results on the major search engine are advertisements. We deliver 100% ad-free, real search results, allowing users to find what they want, without ads getting in the way.\n  Browse safely and privately: Our browser extension, compatible with all major browsers, prevents trackers from following consumers. We never sell or share user data with anyone. It\u2019s part of our  privacy promise. And users can search anonymously in incognito mode.\n  Customize search results: Users can choose the retailers they love and news sources they want to see results from. Neeva users can stay up-to-date on everything from stock picks to the status of packages for delivery on their homepage.\n  Get expert recommended shopping results: We allow users to discover the very best products aggregated in one place, and easily read through reviews from reputable sites and verified customers.\n  Search the web \u2014 and personal accounts: To make searching even more convenient, Neeva users can sync personal email, calendar, and documents so they can find everything they need from one search bar.\n  Support content creators with search queries: We are committed to sharing at least 20% of our topline revenue with content creator partners when their content is used to directly answer a Neeva user\u2019s query. Not only are we committed to paying content creator partners, but we are also working on a set of features to make it easy for content creators to establish direct relationships with Neeva users. For example, Neeva users will be able to easily subscribe to email newsletters directly from a search results page. We are already working with Medium and Quora and in the process of establishing robust and diverse partnerships from news to food to travel and beyond.\n  We provide a browser-based extension, compatible with all major browsers, Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge, and Safari. It runs across all devices and is available via an  iOS app.\n  Neeva is the world\u2019s first private, ad-free search engine, committed to showing you the best result for every search. We will never sell or share your data with anyone, especially advertisers. Go to  neeva.com for a free three-month trial.

", "note_en": "SQL Joins are the quintessential database operation. A join allows the user to slice and dice multiple disparate data sets, e.g., combining transaction data with product SKUs or customer information with purchase history. Similar results could be created without joining but require wide flat tables and possibly heavy pre and post-processing. Properly executed, joins provide flexibility, increase performance and allow for a wide range of data exploration.\n However, joins are, by definition, expensive. A join combines the columns from one or more tables into a new table using one or more predicates to match rows. It is instructive for programmers to think of a JOIN operation semantically equivalent to a  for loop. Given the following query, which combines the records from table  t1 and table  t2 using the predicate column  a in table  t1 equal to column  b in table  t2, we can write a pseudocode  for  loop as follows: \u200d\n   Such an operation has complexity N * M, where N is the number of records in  t1 and M is the number of records in  t2. For small tables, this is trivial (particularly on GPUs). Nevertheless, for large tables or complicated join predicates, we quickly exceed the computational ability of even the most powerful single server systems. Join optimization is a well-studied area of database research, and many well-known approaches mitigate the \u201cN squared\u201d problem detailed above. One common approach is to leverage a hash table data structure to reduce the number of match tests required between the two tables. This method builds a hash table over one of the tables, and the loop is augmented with a lookup into the hash table to obtain the potential set of matching rows: \u200d\n  While the loop structure remains similar to our first example, the hash table can significantly reduce the number of searches in the second loop. In the best case, the hash table can provide both constant time lookup and strict equality guarantees, reducing the loop to: \u200d\n   OmniSciDB supports hash joins with on-the-fly construction of hash tables on both CPU and GPU. Multiple hash functions are supported depending on the complexity of the join\u2019s equality predicate and/or size. Today, we will consider accelerating geospatial join queries using hash joins.\n We define a geospatial join query as one which uses a geospatial operator as the join predicate. A user might have a table of geocoded tweets with longitude and latitude and want to determine what zipcode the tweet falls in -- possibly coloring tweets by zipcode on a rendered map in Immerse. Such a query might look like the following: \u200d\n   (note that left join preserves tweets with no match in the zipcodes datasets, meaning a tweet will be included with a \u201cNULL\u201d color if it has no corresponding zip code, rather than excluded)\n To determine whether a tweet is inside a given zipcode, we need to check the tweet location point against each zipcode polygon exhaustively. Most algorithms require a check of each vertex of the zipcode polygon (there are a few methods for doing this; we use the  winding method) against each point. Assuming we have 1 million tweets and 33,144 zipcodes, comparing each point to each polygon would result in 33 billion comparisons. Since the median zipcode has 166 vertices, we add more zeros for 5,501,904,000,000 total comparisons (5.5 trillion operations). This does not account for the operations required to load data, check boundary conditions, and more, so we can consider it a lower bound. The latest Ampere GPUs have nearly ten teraflops, which executes the above operation in about 500ms, but if we increase our tweets table to 100M, we see time to compute increase to 6 minutes. Most OmniSci customers use data in the range of 500M to the low billions, and most queries in OmniSci run in milliseconds. So, we need to employ some optimization to make geojoins interactive.\n While it may not be readily apparent, we can apply the same hash table technique discussed above to the zipcodes table. We require two conditions; first, we need a suitable hash function to build our hash table. Moreover, we need an expression to hash over that has the following property: ST_Contains is true if the hash join expression is also true. We introduce a new operator called Overlaps, which satisfies this property.\n    We define Overlaps( b,a) or  a overlaps  b to be true if the bounding box of object  a overlaps the bounding box of object  b. Note that this operator may be better named  ApproxOverlaps; we will stick with Overlaps for the rest of this article for brevity. For a point, we consider the bounding box to collapse to the point. So, if  a is a point and  b is another geospatial object, Overlaps returns true if point  a is inside the bounding box surrounding the object  b. Now we will prove ST_Contains is true if and only if Overlaps is true. Assume we have a point  a and a geospatial object  b and a bounding box  b_box. Assume ST_Contains( b, a) is true (that is, the geospatial object  b contains the point  a) and assume Overlaps( b, a) is false (that is,  a does not overlap  b). The bounding box  b_box contains  b by definition. So, if  b contains  a, then  a must be inside the bounding box for  b. Therefore  a overlaps  b. However, we assumed Overlaps( b, a) was false, so we have a contradiction and, if ST_Contains( b, a) is true, then Overlaps( b, a) must also be true.\n We can use this property to replace the expression ST_Contains( b, a) in the query with the binary predicate Overlaps( b, a) AND ST_Contains( b, a). We will then build a hash table over the expression Overlaps( b, a) and use the hash table to reduce the number of comparisons in the join. To do that, we need a hash function. Consider the bounding boxes of the geospatial objects b. If we take the union of all bounding boxes, make it a rectangle, and then subdivide this region into individual bins, each of the same size, we can create a function that spatially maps any point  a into a bin. One such function assigns an integer identifier to each bin, computed by dividing the point coordinates by the corresponding bin dimension and taking the floor.  Space-filling curves are another option. We opted for the simple hash function because our input data is not sorted or ordered, and queries typically target a single bucket, not a range of buckets. The memory locality properties of space-filling curves are an area of future exploration. To build a hash table for this function, we take the bounding box for each polygon, determine the bin(s) the bounding box overlaps, and write an identifier for the polygon into each bin.\n    Putting it all together, we combine the new expression Overlaps( b,a) AND ST_Contains( b,a) with the hash table over Overlaps( b,a). For a given point  a, we first check the hash table to see which bin the point belongs to by applying the hash function to the point. We read the list of polygon IDs from the bin. This operation computes Overlaps for the point  a and all polygons  b (note that the condition is a bit weaker, in that a point could be in the same bin as a polygon but the two could not overlap, but it is sufficient for our purposes as any polygon not in the bin cannot possibly contain the point -- see figure 1 ). This process constrains the total number of comparisons for ST_Contains to only polygons which  might contain the given point. If the bins are low occupancy, we can significantly reduce the number of comparisons required for each point. The following pseudocode illustrates this process: \u200d\n   We started with an expression, ST_Contains( b,a), and rewrote the expression to an equivalent expression, Overlaps( b,a) AND ST_Contains( b,a). We can then use the hash join framework with an appropriate hash function and hash table to constrain the search space of the expression and improve performance. So, how do we choose appropriate bin sizes when building the hash table?\n Hash table sizing is a tradeoff between the size of the hash table and the number of records in each bin. The fewer records in each bin, the less work we have to do per bin; this means fewer expensive ST_Contains operations in our example above. However, as bins get smaller, more bins must cover the same area, increasing the time to build the hash table and its size. Our algorithm (see figure 2) searches for a hash table with low bin occupancy, capped to a maximum size. We parameterize the search over the &#34;bin threshold,&#34; the minimum bin size we will allow in the hash table. The tuner initializes the bin size by iterating over all the bounding boxes we want to add to our hash table and determine the size of the bounding box in each dimension; if that bounding box size is less than the current bin threshold but greater than the current is chosen bin size, we take that as the new bin size. By lowering the bin size threshold, we can systematically search across both hash table size and bin occupancy.\n    We will walk through one step of the tuning process in detail. Each step computes a set of one-dimensional bin sizes (the framework currently only supports two-dimensional bins but is built to support arbitrary dimensionality). We can calculate the total hash table size and a metric for average bin occupancy from the computed bin sizes. We use the calculated size and occupancy to decide whether to continue tuning. First, we look to see if the hash table is too large. If the hash table has grown too big, we use the previously determined threshold value/bin sizes. However, if no previous value exists, we have likely overshot the bin size and need to pick a more significant threshold. In this case, the algorithm reverses itself and picks larger bins until we have a hash table under the size threshold. The remaining two cases are straightforward. Keys per bin is a measure of bin occupancy, i.e., how many bounding boxes overlap a given bin (in aggregate). If the keys per bin are increasing, or if we have reached the keys per bin threshold, we terminate the algorithm, assuming that the size costs of a larger hash table will outweigh any further occupancy gains, and use the values from the previous iteration.\n   We have run several experiments to demonstrate the algorithm search process and tradeoff between bin occupancy and hash table size. The experiments below use a left-hand side table with geotagged records from Twitter&#39;s public API (the &#34;tweets&#34; table). We used an AMD Threadripper 2950X with dual NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPUs. The tweets were loaded with the standard fragment size (32M rows per fragment), split evenly across both GPUs. No additional optimizations were applied. We used three polygon tables; counties in the United States (3,233 rows with 7,944,863 total vertices across all polygons), zipcodes in the United States (33,144 rows with 52,210,207 total vertices), and census blocks in the United States (220,740 rows with 67,581,813 total vertices. The query was a left join between the tweets table and the relevant polygon table, with the first run excluded to eliminate the initial disk fetch of the data. We used a single count aggregate with no filters in the projection. Data for each experiment are in the figures below.\n     All experiments consisted of setting a target key per bin parameter and determining the resulting hash table size, build time, and execution time of the query utilizing the hash table. Using these figures, we can understand how the algorithm behaves in various settings and what the tradeoff between hash table size and bin occupancy means for hash table build time and query execution.\n Generally, results show that as the hash table gets larger, the build time becomes much more expensive, and the execution time can either moderately decrease, remain the same, or even increase. The US Counties in Tweets figure displays time on the y-axis; we see that the build time oscillates wildly at relatively low keys per bin, left of the red dotted line. We also see corresponding oscillations in the hash table size. Figure 4 (below) plotted the chosen bin thresholds against the same target keys per bin as in Figure 3(b). As one would reasonably expect, the largest hash table corresponds to the smallest bin size. However, occupancy and hash table size do not seem to be correlated at these small bin sizes. \u200d\n    To understand this correlation (or lack of correlation), we return to the tuning algorithm; to make tuning decisions, we must select new bin sizes for each step. Reducing the previous bin size by a fixed step and finding the largest bounding box dimension under the new threshold determines the new bin size per dimension. In this way, the algorithm moves through the different-sized bounding boxes, ensuring that at least one bounding box fits roughly within a bin. In practice, this avoids bin sizes scaled by a fixed size that does not match the underlying geometry (mainly since the units of the underlying geometry can vary by the coordinate system). By combining the bin size chooser with hash table size and keys per bin metrics, we can minimize execution time (by maximizing hash table size) using keys per bin to keep build times in check. Indeed, the default solution is either at or relatively close to optimal in Figure 2.\n What happens when the bins get smaller? A slight variation in bin size at small scales results in a dramatic difference in hash table size. The small bin size is typically the result of many steps because the algorithm searches through bin sizes based on existing data and selects smaller bounding boxes at each iteration with a fixed step size. The keys per bin occupancy metric change as we work through bounding boxes of similar sizes. Suddenly, we jump to a much smaller bounding box; this causes the hash table size to increase dramatically and change the occupancy, which terminates the algorithm at the previous iteration (see Figure 4b). Essentially, the bin occupancy metric prevents us from \u201cfalling through\u201d bounding boxes to one which is much smaller than the \u201caverage\u201d bounding box size in the dataset.\n In summary, our experiments show that the occupancy metric helps the tuning algorithm avoid dramatic changes in hash table size due to &#34;slipping down&#34; to the next group of bounding boxes, which may be much smaller than our experimentation group. By combining an experimentally determined minimum occupancy threshold with occupancy trend, we can abort tuning right at the edge of a reasonably large hash table (giving low bin occupancy and good performance) without falling into an unstable region where the hash table size can increase by orders of magnitude or oscillate wildly across similar occupancy metrics. While this algorithm produces strong results, additional optimizations are possible. We want to solve the optimization problem to maximize hash table size for a given occupancy threshold and pick an occupancy threshold that maximizes query execution time without creating an unreasonable build time. Consider this our first attempt at approximating a solution.\n Even though we are looking at additional optimizations to increase parallelism and performance of our overlaps join approach, it already has shown to be of immense benefit for bringing big geo-joins to be interactive or near-interactive performance levels. On a machine, with 2 Nvidia RTX 3090 GPUs, overlaps join increased performance over loop join between 200 to 1,200X on various examples, at the most extreme increasing a join of US tweets to US census block groups from 11.3K lookups per second with loop join to 22.38M lookups per second with overlaps join.\u00a0 Finally, we believe there are additional speedups possible. For example, experiments leveraging space-filling curves to order and hash the data suggest the potential to gain an additional 3-4X in performance by increasing spatial locality and lowering execution divergence during the probe phase of the hash join, so stay tuned for more on this front.\n Point in polygon joins are just one example application of the techniques described above. The generic OVERLAPS operator applies to various queries, including spatial and temporal queries (or combinations of the two). In general, two broad applications emerge; queries requiring an algorithm to construct the hash table and queries that dictate the construction of the hash table based on the predicate defining the OVERLAPS relationship in the query. We have implemented distance joins between geospatial points as an example of the latter type; if a user requests all points within N units of each other, we can construct the hash table such that a simple search of neighboring bins is always guaranteed to return the points which might be within N units of each other. While we are in the early stages of productionizing these techniques, the point in polygon join is available in OmniSci as of version 5.6 across all product modalities, including desktop, OmniSci

", "note_en": "KVM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is the de-facto standard hypervisor for Linux-based cloud environments. Outside of Azure, almost all large-scale cloud and hosting providers are running on top of KVM, turning it into one of the fundamental security boundaries in the cloud.\n    In this blog post I describe a   vulnerability \u00a0in KVM\u2019s AMD-specific code and discuss how this bug can be turned into a full virtual machine escape.  To the best of my knowledge, this is the first public writeup of a KVM guest-to-host breakout that does not rely on bugs in user space components such as QEMU. The discussed bug was assigned CVE-2021-29657, affects kernel versions  v5.10-rc1 to v5.12-rc6 \u00a0and was patched at the end of   March \u00a02021 . \u00a0As the bug only became exploitable in v5.10 and was discovered roughly 5 months later, most real world deployments of KVM should not be affected. I still think the issue is an interesting case study in the work required to build a stable guest-to-host escape against KVM and hope that this writeup can strengthen the case that hypervisor compromises are not only theoretical issues.\n    I start with a short overview of KVM\u2019s architecture, before diving into the bug and its exploitation.\n     KVM is a Linux based open source hypervisor supporting hardware accelerated virtualization on x86, ARM, PowerPC and S/390. In contrast to the other big open source hypervisor Xen, KVM is deeply integrated with the Linux Kernel and builds on its scheduling, memory management and hardware integrations to provide efficient virtualization.\n    KVM is implemented as one or more kernel modules (kvm.ko plus kvm-intel.ko or kvm-amd.ko on x86) that expose a low-level IOCTL-based   API \u00a0to user space processes over the /dev/kvm device. Using this API, a user space process (often called VMM for Virtual Machine Manager) can create new VMs, assign vCPUs and memory, and intercept memory or IO accesses to provide access to  emulate d or virtualization-aware hardware devices.   QEMU \u00a0has been the standard user space choice for KVM-based virtualization for a long time, but in the last few years alternatives like   LKVM ,   crosvm \u00a0or   Firecracker \u00a0have started to become popular.\n    While KVM\u2019s reliance on a separate user space component might seem complicated at first, it has a very nice benefit: Each VM running on a KVM host has a 1:1 mapping to a Linux process, making it managable using standard Linux tools.\n    This means for example, that a guest&#39;s memory can be inspected by dumping the allocated memory of its user space process or that resource limits for CPU time and memory can be applied easily. Additionally, KVM can offload most work related to device emulation to the userspace component. Outside of a couple of performance-sensitive devices related to interrupt handling, all of the complex low-level code for providing virtual disk, network or GPU access can be implemented in userspace.\n    When looking at public writeups of KVM-related vulnerabilities and exploits it becomes clear that this design was a wise decision. The large majority of disclosed vulnerabilities and all publicly available exploits affect QEMU and its support for emulated/paravirtualized devices.\n    Even though KVM\u2019s kernel attack surface is significantly smaller than the one exposed by a default QEMU configuration or similar user space VMMs, a KVM vulnerability has advantages that make it very valuable for an attacker:\n Whereas user space VMMs can be sandboxed to reduce the impact of a VM breakout, no such option is available for KVM itself. Once an attacker is able to achieve code execution (or similarly powerful primitives like write access to page tables) in the context of the host kernel, the system is fully compromised.\n Due to the somewhat poor security history of QEMU, new user space VMMs like crosvm or Firecracker are written in Rust, a memory safe language. Of course, there can still be non-memory safety vulnerabilities or problems due to incorrect or buggy usage of the KVM APIs, but using Rust effectively prevents the large majority of bugs that were discovered in C-based user space VMMs in the past.\n Finally, a pure KVM exploit can work against targets that use proprietary or heavily modified user space VMMs. While the big cloud providers do not go into much detail about their virtualization stacks publicly, it is safe to assume that they do not depend on an unmodified QEMU version for their production workloads. In contrast, KVM\u2019s smaller code base makes heavy modifications unlikely (and KVM\u2019s contributor list points at a strong tendency to upstream such modifications when they exist).\n      With these advantages in mind, I decided to spend some time hunting for a KVM vulnerability that could be turned into a guest-to-host escape. In the past, I had   some success \u00a0with finding vulnerabilities in KVM\u2019s support for nested virtualization on Intel CPUs so reviewing the same functionality for AMD seemed like a good starting point. This is even more true, \u00a0because the recent increase of AMD\u2019s market share in the server segment means that KVM\u2019s AMD implementation is suddenly becoming a more interesting target than it was in the last years.\n    Nested virtualization, the ability for a VM (called L1) to spawn nested guests (L2), was also a niche feature for a long time. However, due to hardware improvements that reduce its overhead and increasing customer demand it\u2019s becoming more widely available. For example, Microsoft is heavily pushing for   Virtualization-based Security \u00a0as part of newer Windows versions, requiring nested virtualization to support cloud-hosted Windows installations. KVM enables support for nested virtualization on both AMD \u00a0and \u00a0Intel by default, so if an administrator or the user space VMM does not explicitly disable it, it\u2019s part of the attack surface for a malicious or compromised VM.\n    AMD\u2019s virtualization extension is called SVM (for Secure Virtual Machine) and in order to support nested virtualization, the host hypervisor needs to intercept all SVM instructions that are executed by its guests, emulate their behavior and keep its state in sync with the underlying hardware. As you might imagine, implementing this correctly is quite difficult with a large potential for complex logic flaws, making it a perfect target for manual code review.\n     Before diving into the KVM codebase and the bug I discovered, I want to quickly introduce how AMD SVM works to make the rest of the post easier to understand. (For a thorough documentation see   AMD64 Architecture Programmer\u2019s Manual, Volume 2: System Programming Chapter 15 .) SVM adds support for 6 new instructions to x86-64 if SVM support is enabled by setting the SVME bit in the EFER MSR. The most interesting of these instructions is  VMRUN , which (as its name suggests) is responsible for running a guest VM.  VMRUN  takes an implicit parameter via the RAX register pointing to the page-aligned physical address of a data structure called \u201cvirtual machine control block\u201d (VMCB), which describes the state and configuration of the VM.\n    The VMCB is split into two parts: First, the State Save area, which stores the values of all guest registers, including segment and control registers. Second, the Control area which describes the configuration of the VM. The Control area describes the virtualization features enabled for a VM, \u00a0sets which VM actions are intercepted to trigger a VM exit  and \u00a0stores some fundamental configuration values such as the page table address used for   nested paging .\n    If the VMCB is correctly prepared (and we are not already running in a VM), VMRUN will first save the host state in a memory region called the host save area, whose address is configured by writing a physical address to the VM_HSAVE_PA MSR. Once the host state is saved, the CPU switches to the VM context and VMRUN only returns once a VM exit is triggered for one reason or another.\n    An interesting aspect of SVM is that a lot of the state recovery after a VM exit has to be done by the hypervisor. Once a VM exit occurs, only RIP, RSP and RAX are restored to the previous host values and all other general purpose registers still contain the guest values. In addition, a full context switch requires manual execution of the VMSAVE/VMLOAD instructions which save/load additional system registers (FS, SS, LDTR, STAR, LSTAR \u2026) from memory.\n    For nested virtualization to work, KVM intercepts execution of the VMRUN instruction and creates its own VMCB based on the VMCB the L1 guest prepared (called vmcb12 in KVM terminology). Of course, KVM can\u2019t trust the guest provided vmcb12 and needs to carefully validate all fields that end up in the real VMCB that gets passed to the hardware (known as vmcb02).\n    Most of the KVM\u2019s code for nested virtualization on AMD is implemented in   arch/x86/kvm/svm/nested.c \u00a0and the code that intercepts VMRUN instructions of nested guests is implemented in  nested_svm_vmrun :\n           * Save the old vmcb, so we don&#39;t need to pick what we save, but can\n      The function first fetches the value of RAX out of the currently active vmcb ( svm-&gt;vcmb ) in  1  (numbers are marked in the code samples) . For guests using nested paging (which is the only relevant configuration nowadays) RAX contains a guest physical address (GPA), which needs to be translated into a host physical address (HPA) first.  kvm_vcpu_map \u00a0( 2 ) takes care of this translation and maps the underlying page to a host virtual address (HVA) that can be directly accessed by KVM.\n    Once the VMCB is mapped,  nested_vmcb_checks \u00a0is called for some basic validation in  3 . Afterwards, the L1 guest context which is stored in  svm-&gt;vmcb \u00a0is copied into the host save area  svm-&gt;nested.hsave \u00a0before KVM enters the nested guest context by calling  enter_svm_guest_mode \u00a0( 4 ) .\n         Looking at  enter_svm_guest_mode \u00a0we can see that KVM copies the vmcb12 control area directly into svm-&gt;nested.ctl and does not perform any further checks on the copied value.\n  Readers familiar with double fetch or Time-of-Check-to-Time-of-Use vulnerabilities might already see a potential issue here: The call to  nested_vmcb_checks \u00a0at the beginning of  nested_svm_vmrun \u00a0performs all of its checks on a copy of the VMCB that is stored in guest memory. This means that a guest with multiple CPU cores can modify fields in the VMCB after they are verified in  nested_vmcb_checks , but before they are copied to svm-&gt;nested.ctl in  load_nested_vmcb_control .\n    Let\u2019s look at  nested_vmcb_checks  to see what kind of checks we can bypass with this approach:\n         At first glance this looks pretty harmless.  control-&gt;asid \u00a0isn\u2019t used anywhere and the last check is only relevant for systems where nested paging isn\u2019t supported. However, the first check turns out to be very interesting.\n    For reasons unknown to me, SVM VMCBs contain a bit that enables or disables interception of the VMRUN instruction when executed inside a guest. Clearing this bit isn\u2019t actually supported by hardware and results in an immediate VMEXIT, so the check in  nested_vmcb_check_controls \u00a0simply replicates this behavior. \u00a0When we race and bypass the check by repeatedly flipping the value of the INTERCEPT_VMRUN bit, we can end up in a situation where svm-&gt;nested.ctl contains a 0 in place of the INTERCEPT_VMRUN bit. To understand the impact we first need to see how nested vmexit\u2019s are handled in KVM:\n    The main SVM exit handler is the function  handle_exit \u00a0in   arch/x86/kvm/svm.c , which is called whenever a VMexit occurs. When KVM is running a nested guest, it first has to check if the exit should be handled by itself or the L1 hypervisor. To do this it calls the function  nested_svm_exit_handled \u00a0( 5 ) whi ch will return  NESTED_EXIT_DONE if the vmexit will be handled by the L1 hypervisor and no further processing by the L0 hypervisor is needed :\n           nested_svm_exit_handled \u00a0first calls  nested_svm_intercept (6) \u00a0to see if the exit should be handled. When we trigger an exit by executing VMRUN in a L2 guest, the default case is executed ( 7 )  to see if the INTERCEPT_VMRUN bit in svm-&gt;nested.ctl is set.  Normally, this should always be the case and the function returns NESTED_EXIT_DONE to trigger a nested VM exit from L2 to L1 and to let the L1 hypervisor handle the exit ( 8 ). (This way KVM supports infinite nesting of hypervisors).\n    However, if the L1 guest exploited the race condition described above svm-&gt;nested.ctl won\u2019t have the INTERCEPT_VMRUN bit set and the VM exit will be handled by KVM itself. This results in a second call to  nested_svm_vmrun \u00a0while still running inside the L2 guest context.  nested_svm_vmrun \u00a0isn\u2019t written to handle this situation and will blindly overwrite the L1 context stored in  svm-&gt;nested.hsave \u00a0with data from the currently active  svm-&gt;vmcb \u00a0which contains data for the L2 guest:\n     * Save the old vmcb, so we don&#39;t need to pick what we save, but can\n    This becomes a security issue due to the way Model Specific Register (MSR) intercepts are handled for nested guests:\n  SVM uses a permission bitmap to control which MSRs can be accessed by a VM. The bitmap is a 8KB data structure with two bits per MSR, one of which controls read access and the other write access. A 1 bit in this position means the access is intercepted and triggers a vm exit, a 0 bit means the VM has direct access to the MSR. The HPA address of the bitmap is stored in the VMCB control area and for normal L1 KVM guests, the pages are allocated and pinned into memory as soon as a vCPU is created.\n    For a nested guest, the MSR permission bitmap is stored in  svm-&gt;nested.msrpm \u00a0and its physical address is copied into the active VMCB (in  svm-&gt;vmcb-&gt;control.msrpm_base_pa ) while the nested guest is running. Using the described double invocation of  nested_svm_vmrun , a malicious guest can copy this value into the  svm-&gt;nested.hsave \u00a0VMCB when  copy_vmcb_control_area \u00a0is executed. This is interesting because the KVM\u2019s hsave area normally only contains data from the L1 guest context so  svm-&gt;nested.hsave.msrpm_base_pa \u00a0would normally point to the pinned vCPU-specific MSR bitmap pages.\n      Since commit \u201c  2fcf4876: KVM: nSVM: implement on demand allocation of the nested state \u201d from last October, svm-&gt;nested.msrpm is dynamically allocated and freed when a guest changes the SVME bit of the MSR_EFER register:\n       For the \u201cdisable SVME\u201d case, KVM will first call  svm_leave_nested \u00a0to forcibly leave potential\n  nested guests and then free the  svm-&gt;nested \u00a0data structures (including the backing pages for the MSR permission bitmap) in  svm_free_nested . As  svm_leave_nested \u00a0believes that  svm-&gt;nested.hsave \u00a0contains the saved context of the L1 guest, it simply copies its control area to the real VMCB:\n           svm-&gt;nested-&gt;msrpm . Once  svm_free_nested \u00a0is finished and KVM passes control back to the guest, the CPU will use the freed pages for its MSR permission checks. This gives a guest unrestricted access to host MSRs if the pages are reused and partially overwritten with zeros.\n    To summarize, a malicious guest can gain access to host MSRs using the following approach:\n Repeatedly try to launch a L2 guest using the VMRUN instruction while flipping the INTERCEPT_VMRUN bit on a second CPU core.\n If VMRUN succeeds, try to launch a \u201cL3\u201d guest using another invocation of VMRUN. If this fails, we have lost the race in step 2 and must try again. If VMRUN succeeds we have successfully overwritten  svm-&gt;nested.hsave \u00a0with our L2 context.\n Clear the SVME bit in MSR_EFER while still running in the \u201cL3\u201d context. This frees the MSR permission bitmap backing pages used by the L2 guest who is now executing again.\n Wait until the KVM host reuses the backing pages. This will potentially clear all or some of the bits, giving the guest access to host MSRs.\n    When I initially discovered and reported this vulnerability, I was feeling pretty confident that this type of MSR access should be more or less equivalent to full code execution on the host. While my feeling turned out to be correct, getting there still took me multiple weeks of exploit development. In the next section I\u2019ll describe the steps to turn this primitive into a guest-to-host escape.\n     Assuming our guest can get full unrestricted access to any MSR (which is only a question of timing thanks to init_on_alloc=1 being the default for most modern distributions), how can we escalate this into running arbitrary code in the context of the KVM host? To answer this question we first need to look at what kind of MSRs are supported on a modern AMD system. Looking at the   BIOS and Kernel Developer\u2019s Guide \u00a0for recent AMD processors we can find a wide range of MSRs starting with well known and widely used ones such as EFER (the Extended Feature Enable Register) or LSTAR (the syscall target address) to rarely used ones like SMI_ON_IO_TRAP (can be used to generate a System Management Mode Interrupt when specific IO port ranges are accessed).\n  Looking at the list, several registers like LSTAR or KERNEL_GSBASE seem like interesting targets for redirecting the execution of the host kernel. Unrestricted access to these registers is actually  enabled by default , however they are automatically restored to a valid state by KVM after a vmexit so modifying them does not lead to any changes in host behavior.\n    Still, there is one MSR that we previously mentioned and that seems to give us a straightforward way to achieve code execution: The VM_HSAVE_PA that stores the physical address of the host save area, which is used to restore the host context when a vmexit occurs. If we can point this MSR at a memory location under our control we should be able to fake a malicious host context and execute our own code after a vmexit.\n     AMD is pretty clear about the fact that software should not touch the host save area in any way and that the data stored in this area is CPU-dependent: \u201c Processor implementations may store only part or none of host state in the memory area pointed to by VM_HSAVE_PA MSR and may store some or all host state in hidden on-chip memory. Different implementations may choose to save the hidden parts of the host\u2019s segment registers as well as the selectors. For these reasons, software must not rely on the format or contents of the host state save area, nor attempt to change host state by modifying the contents of the host save area. \u201d (AMD64 Architecture Programmer\u2019s Manual, Volume 2: System Programming, Page 477). To strengthen the point, the format of the host save area is undocumented.\n Debugging issues involving an invalid host state is very tedious as any issue leads to an immediate processor shutdown. Even worse, I wasn\u2019t sure if rewriting the VM_HSAVE_PA MSR while running inside a VM can even work. It\u2019s not really something that should happen during normal operation so in the worst case scenario, overwriting the MSR would just lead to an immediate crash.\n Even if we can create a valid (but malicious) host save area in our guest, we still need some way to identify its host physical address (HPA). Because our guest runs with nested paging enabled, physical addresses that we can see in the guest (GPAs) are still one address translation away from their HPA equivalent.\n    After spending some time scrolling through AMD\u2019s documentation, I still decided that VM_HSAVE_PA seems to be the best way forward and decided to tackle these problems one by one.\n    After dumping the host save area of a normal KVM guest running on an AMD EPYC 7351P CPU, the first problem goes away quickly: As it turns out, the host save area has the same layout as a normal VMCB with only a couple of relevant fields initialized. Even better, the initialized fields include all the saved host information documented in the AMD manual so the fear that a\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:39:17", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u9003\u751f,escape,kvm", "title": "\u4e00\u4e2aEPYC\u9003\u751f\uff1a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76KVM\u7a81\u7834 ", "title_en": "An EPYC escape: Case-study of a KVM breakout", "transed": 1, "url": "https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/06/an-epyc-escape-case-study-of-kvm.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9003\u751f", "escape", "kvm"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1068677, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u6025\u6027\u547c\u5438\u7efc\u5408\u5f81\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd22\uff08SARS-COV-2\uff09\u4fe1\u4f7fRNA\uff08mRNA\uff09\u7684\u75ab\u82d7\u5728\u9884\u9632\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u75be\u75c52019\u5e741-5\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u301c95\uff05\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u75ab\u82d7\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u6297\u4f53\u5206\u6ccc\u6297\u4f53\uff08PBS\uff09\u548c\u751f\u53d1\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff08GC\uff09B\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4ecd\u7136\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u63a5\u53d7\u4e24\u5242BNT162B2\u768414\u4e2a\u60a3\u8005\u768414\u4e2a\u4e2a\u4f53\u4e2d\u68c0\u67e5\u4e86\u5916\u5468\u8840\uff08n = 41\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6297\u539f\u7279\u5f02\u6027B\u7ec6\u80de\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u572814\u4e2a\u60a3\u6709\u4e24\u79cd\u5242\u91cf\u7684BNT162B2\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u5168\u957fSARS-COV-2\u98d9\u5347\u7684mRNA\u7684\u75ab\u82d7\uff08S \uff09\u57fa\u56e01.\u5faa\u73afIgG-\u548cIgA\u5206\u6cccPBS\u9776\u5411\u7b2c\u4e8c\u514d\u75ab\u540e\u4e00\u5468\u8fbe\u5230\u7684S\u86cb\u767d\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u4e09\u5468\u540e\u6301\u7eed\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9bPB\u53cd\u5e94\u524d\u9762\u7684\u8840\u6e05\u6297\u8840\u6e05\u6297\u672b\u671f\u548c\u4e2d\u548c\u6297\u4f53\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4ee5\u65e9\u671f\u5faa\u73af\u7684SARS-COV-2\u83cc\u682a\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b0\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5148\u524d\u611f\u67d3\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u6700\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8840\u6676\u53cd\u5e94\u7684SARS-COV-2 \u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u67e5\u6392\u51fa\u814b\u7a9dLNS\u7684\u7ec6\u9488\u5438\u6c14\u7269\uff08FNA\uff09\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9274\u5b9a\u4e86\u5728\u539f\u53d1\u6027\u514d\u75ab\u540e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6240\u6709\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4e2d\u62df\u5408S\u86cb\u767d\u7684GC B\u7ec6\u80de\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6392\u51fa\u7684LNS\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u7684S\u7ed3\u5408GC B\u7ec6\u80de\u548cPBS\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u5242\u514d\u75ab\u540e\u81f3\u5c1112\u5468\u3002 S\u7ed3\u5408GC B\u7ec6\u80de\u884d\u751f\u7684\u5355\u514b\u9686\u6297\u4f53\u4e3b\u8981\u9776\u5411S\u86cb\u767d\u7684\u53d7\u4f53\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u57df\uff0c\u5176\u514b\u9686\u8f83\u5c11\u4e0eN-\u672b\u7aef\u7ed3\u6784\u57df\u6216\u4e0e\u4eba\u8d1d\u66ff\u59a5\u8461\u8404\u75c5\u6bd2OC43\u548cHKU1\u5171\u7528\u7684\u8868\u4f4d\u3002\u4e0e\u4ec5\u8bc6\u522bSARS-COV-2 S\u86cb\u767d\u7684\u90a3\u4e9b\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u4ea4\u53c9\u53cd\u5e94\u6027B\u7ec6\u80de\u514b\u9686\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u4f53\u91cd\u7a81\u53d8\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u50a8\u5668B\u7ec6\u80de\u6765\u6e90\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eSARS-COV-2 mRNA\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6301\u7eed\u7684GC B\u7ec6\u80de\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4f53\u6db2\u514d\u75ab\u529b\u3002\n       \n     \u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4ea4\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u60a8\u540c\u610f\u9075\u5b88\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6761\u6b3e\u548c\u793e\u533a\u6307\u5357\u3002\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u53d1\u73b0\u6ee5\u7528\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u6216\u4e0d\u9075\u5b88\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6761\u6b3e\u6216\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u8bf7\u5c06\u5176\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5408\u9002\u3002 ", "note_en": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines are ~95% effective in preventing coronavirus disease 2019 1\u20135.

These PB responses preceded maximal levels of serum anti-S binding and neutralizing antibodies to an early circulating SARS-CoV-2 strain as well as emerging variants, especially in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, who produced the most robust serologic responses. By examining fine needle aspirates (FNAs) of draining axillary LNs, we identified GC B cells that bound S protein in all participants sampled after primary immunization. Remarkably, high frequencies of S-binding GC B cells and PBs were sustained in these draining LNs for at least twelve weeks after the booster immunization. S-binding GC B cell-derived monoclonal antibodies predominantly targeted the receptor binding domain of the S protein, with fewer clones binding to the N-terminal domain or to epitopes shared with the S proteins of the human betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1. The latter cross-reactive B cell clones had higher levels of somatic hypermutation compared to those that only recognized SARS-CoV-2 S protein, suggesting a memory B cell origin. Our studies demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccination of humans induces a persistent GC B cell response, enabling the generation of robust humoral immunity.\n       \n     By submitting a comment you agree to abide by our  Terms and  Community Guidelines.

His plan is billed not only as an infrastructure plan but one that would help respond to the climate crisis. A big part of that is making it easier for more Americans to travel by mass transit. The Biden plan noted that \u201cAmerica lags its peers \u2014 including Canada, the U.K., and Australia \u2014 in the on-time and on-budget delivery of infrastructure,\u201d but that understates the problem.\n Not only are these projects inordinately expensive, states and localities are not even attempting to build particularly ambitious projects. The US is the sixth-most expensive country in the world to build rapid-rail transit infrastructure like the New York City Subway, the Washington Metro, or the Chicago \u201cL.\u201d And that\u2019s with the nation often avoiding tunneling projects, which are often the most complicated and expensive parts of any new metro line. According to the Transit Costs Project, the five countries with higher costs than the US \u201care building projects that are more than 80 percent tunneled ... [whereas in the US] only 37 percent of the total track length is tunneled.\u201d\n   There\u2019s no one simple reason for this. Experts are clamoring for the government to collect more data, but the complexity of the problem lends itself to complex solutions. Still, the stakes are high. NYU researchers  noted the massive economic stakes, pointing to studies that show that building dense urban transit networks could increase aggregate economic growth by roughly 10 percent.\n The goal is bigger than a single light rail line or a trolley; it\u2019s about creating transit networks that allow people to navigate from home to work to play easily enough to give up their cars, thereby reducing pollution and congestion. It\u2019s not enough that the nation\u2019s richest states can afford to build one or two transit projects every couple of decades. Bringing down costs is paramount to achieve the climate and economic benefits that accompany transit projects.\n   America\u2019s infrastructure cost problem isn\u2019t just confined to transit, it\u2019s also the country\u2019s highways.\n Research by New York Federal Reserve Bank and Brown University researchers reveals that the cost to construct a \u201clane mile of interstate increased five-fold\u201d between 1990 and 2008. New construction \u2014 widening and building interchanges and building new sections of road altogether \u2014 is where the bulk of the problem lies, says one of the researchers, economist Matthew Turner. (The cost of \u201cheavy maintenance\u201d like resurfacing increased as well, but Turner said that\u2019s due almost entirely to the rise in the price of certain paving materials.)\n Leah Brooks, an economist at George Washington University, also studied the highway problem. Her  research finds that states spent nearly three times as much to build a mile of highway in the 1980s as they did in the early \u201860s.\n \u201cBig picture for the interstate highway system is that we saw relatively reasonable cost increases [from the mid 1950s] to about the early \u201870s and then pretty substantial cost increases thereafter,\u201d Brooks explained.\n   And when it comes to mass transit, looking closer at the major projects states have attempted in comparison with their international counterparts is clarifying. The Eno Center for Transportation  painted a dismal picture in its  recent report: On a per mile basis, America\u2019s transit rail projects are some of the most expensive in the world. In New York, the Second Avenue Subway cost $2.6 billion per mile, in San Francisco the Central Subway cost $920 million per mile, in Los Angeles the Purple Line cost $800 million per mile.\n In contrast, Copenhagen built a project at just $323 million per mile, and Paris and Madrid did their projects for $160 million and $320 million per mile, respectively. These are massive differences in cost.\n Paul Lewis, vice president of policy and finance at the Eno Center, broke it down: \u201cThe US has a pretty big premium for tunnel projects across the board and a slight premium for [above-ground] projects.\u201d\n Researchers have ruled out some of the more obvious potential explanations for why these projects cost more in the US.\n As transit researcher Alon Levy writes in a  report for the Niskanen Center, \u201cThis is not about our wealth: there is no correlation between a country\u2019s GDP per capita and its subway construction costs. Nor is it about geological factors: the biggest factor behind a project\u2019s cost is what country it is in, and costs are fairly consistent even across different geologies ... This is purely institutional.\u201d\n And when it comes to roads and the bulk of the high costs \u2014 \u201cthe new construction bit\u201d \u2014 Turner says even though he has  \u201cno idea why those prices are increasing,\u201d he can \u201celiminate a lot of things.\u201d Turner explains that common theories like  unions or  the way we\u2019re building roads or  where we\u2019re  building them (for example, in more urban areas) are not supported by statistical evidence.\n  I moved to Montgomery County, Maryland, in 1999. Officials  had been thinking about building a rail line across the county for more than a decade at that point. More than 20 years later, the Purple Line is only 40 percent built and has run hundreds of millions of dollars over budget,  according to the Washington Post.\n As the Action Committee for Transit, a local pro-transit organization,  documented, residents of the wealthy DC suburb of Chevy Chase have led a decades-long crusade against the light rail project,  which will benefit the entire region, by claiming that a \u201ctiny transparent invertebrate\u201d might be at risk. \u201cWhen no endangered amphipods were found,\u201d the detractors turned to other arguments. However, repeated references to the potential harm to the Columbia Country Club and also a public comment disparaging the needs of people in less affluent communities makes clear that much of the stated concern was likely never environmental or financial.\n Gustavo Torres, executive director of a local immigration rights advocacy group CASA  told the Baltimore Sun: \u201cRight now, for a domestic worker to go to Bethesda to work, it takes two hours because they take three buses,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the Purple Line, it is going to take between 15 and 20 minutes.\u201d\n Any major project will incur harms on some group of people \u2014 construction can impede traffic, new structures can obstruct a view from your porch, things that reasonable people would agree are annoying or costly. But transportation projects have to go somewhere , and  one only has to look at the housing market to see the costs of allowing individual citizens to derail projects due to real or fabricated harms.\n   Brooks, the George Washington University economist, explained that the case of the Purple Line might explain many of the cost increases we\u2019ve seen over the decades. What does she call this phenomenon? \u201cWe call this the rise of citizen voice.\u201d\n Brooks ruled out the \u201cperfectly reasonable explanations\u201d like paying workers more or the increased cost of highway materials as driving much of the cost increase. Instead, she says, judicial, statutory, and administrative changes \u2014 in particular the passage of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in 1970 \u2014 have led to increased power for citizens.\n This isn\u2019t inherently an issue \u2014 while it raises costs to engage with lawsuits, if it stops the government from taking harmful action, that could be a good thing! Sometimes costs are rising because we\u2019re paying for something valuable, for instance higher safety standards and accessibility infrastructure like elevators.\n But often, we\u2019re just paying for wealthy individuals to exert their preferences over everyone else.\n NEPA required environmental impact statements (EIS) for \u201cmajor federal actions\u201d that could \u201csignificantly affect\u201d the environment,  write the Niskanen Center\u2019s Brink Lindsey and Samuel Hammond. Lawsuits have turned what were once reasonable requirements into behemoths:\n An EIS could be as short as 10 pages ... [but]  under the pressure of litigation the law\u2019s demands grew ever more onerous: Today the average EIS runs more than 600 pages, plus appendices that typically exceed 1,000 pages. The average EIS now takes 4.5 years to complete; between 2010 and 2017, four such statements were completed after delays of 17 years or more. And remember, no ground can be broken on a project until the EIS has made it through the legal gauntlet \u2013 and this includes both federal projects and private projects that require a federal permit.\n \u201cOnce the construction process starts, people complain. And those complaints lead to lawsuits,\u201d NYU professor and transit researcher Eric Goldwyn explains. Even in New York City where in 2018,  62 percent of all reported trips were made by transit, biking, or walking, the Second Avenue Subway project was plagued with disruptions by locals.\n SPUR, a California public policy nonprofit, argues that its state\u2019s environmental protection law (CEQA) \u201cis often used inappropriately to delay or stop transit and sustainable transportation projects that would have significant benefit to the environment.\u201d As city planner and UCLA housing researcher Nolan Gray  documented in the Atlantic, CEQA lawsuits have \u201cimperiled  infill housing in Sacramento,  solar farms in San Diego, and  transit in San Francisco. The mere threat of a lawsuit is enough to stop small projects\u2014especially housing\u2014from starting in the first place.\u201d\n \u201cThere are egregious examples of this,\u201d SPUR\u2019s transportation policy director Laura Tolkoff told me. \u201cOne person sued the San Francisco bicycle plan over parking losses which basically held up 34 miles of bike lanes for over four years. Over 2,000 individuals were  injured during that same time period due to collision while riding their bicycle.\u201d\n In Tolkoff\u2019s example, the state\u2019s environmental protection law was being used to defend a parking lot.\n  To try and figure out the root causes of America\u2019s transit costs problem, NYU researchers \tGoldwyn, Alon Levy, and Elif Ensari  looked to Boston, where the Green Line Extension (GLX) has been in the works for three decades. The 4.3-mile light rail project was estimated to cost $1.12 billion in 2012 \u2014 by 2015, that number had nearly tripled. Unsurprisingly, the project was put on hold.\n \u201cOne of the things that is so vexing about this issue is that there\u2019s not just one obvious thing,\u201d Eric Goldwyn, an assistant professor at NYU and a member of the Transit Costs Project, told Vox.\n But the researchers were able to identify a few reasons for what happened to the Green Line: Jockeying between two different understaffed agencies with little experience managing large projects and consultants, a laissez-faire approach to allowing stakeholders\u2019 expensive ideas to be added to the project scope \u201ceven if impractical,\u201d and  public pressure for more as the project dragged on and the demand for transit options increased.\n   While Boston\u2019s cost overruns were extreme, even for the US, the lessons learned in this case study are ones repeated by the experts Vox spoke with.\n One reason the US isn\u2019t very good at building transit cheaply is that it doesn\u2019t practice.\n \u201cIf you look at Paris or Seoul or Shanghai, they\u2019ve been building [transit] pretty much nonstop for decades now. New York, on the other hand, built its subway at a breakneck pace until 1940 and then cooled it,\u201d Goldwyn explained.\n Agencies aren\u2019t routinely in charge of building new things, so every time they do, it\u2019s back to the drawing board.\n \u201cThere\u2019s a learning curve, almost with every city, when they\u2019re introducing rail, because you don\u2019t have a local knowledge base on how to do this,\u201d explained Ethan Elkind, director of the climate program at UC Berkeley\u2019s Center for Law, Energy &amp; the Environment. \u201cWhether that\u2019s on the construction side or the oversight side or public management side. You do see a lot of cities stumble out of the gate when they\u2019re trying to get their first projects done.\u201d\n Then there\u2019s the complexity of building across multiple jurisdictions. The federal government often provides funding for a project that requires multiple cities or counties to coordinate, all to complete a multibillion-dollar project unlike one they\u2019ve probably ever accomplished before, often without a clearly defined leader \u2014 it\u2019s like the most dysfunctional group project ever.\n Elkind noted that even when the federal government works with a single jurisdiction, it can get messy, pointing to  \u201cthe existence of both Farragut North and Farragut West stations [in Washington, DC] \u2014 there was supposed to be one station but  the federal government wouldn\u2019t hand over this parcel that would have provided for one unified station.\u201d\n   Further, these agencies are often understaffed, creating bottlenecks at  every step of the process: \u201cThe nature of these projects is that you get questions about like \u2018should I use this CCTV wiring or that one\u2019 \u2014 you need people who can respond quickly and be expert enough on an array of topics [to keep the project moving],\u201d Goldwyn explained.\n Levy highlighted the failure of American institutions to turn to other parts of the world to learn what they are doing better: \u201cGetting more of these planning managers to say we need to be more German, more Italian, more Swedish, Korean \u2014 that\u2019s really hard,\u201d they said. \u201cThe United States is so bad at learning from other countries. If something in America doesn\u2019t work [and] in other countries it does work, people don\u2019t really course-correct.\u201d\n Transit agencies and local governments also  sometimes try to preempt public outcry, creating more work for themselves in the process. The Boston Green Line, for instance, proposed limiting construction to between 10 pm and 7 am and  required that traffic keep flowing. But as the transit costs researchers noted, \u201claborers are less productive when they have to spend the first hour of their shift setting things up and the last hour breaking things down to mask the fact that there is a major construction project underway. ... [I]n Istanbul, transit construction projects run 24 hours a day.\u201d In the span of seven years (the expected duration of the Green Line\u2019s 4.3-mile project), Istanbul built over 12 miles of subway.\n \u201cHere in the United States, we as a country are not very accepting of disruption,\u201d Goldwyn told Vox. In Los Angeles, workers constructing the Purple Line could only work weekends \u2014 then  Covid-19 hit, and stay-at-home orders made it possible for them to work 24/7. The result?\n   After all this talk of cost overruns and inordinate spending on various projects, you might think that the US is spending way too much on transportation. In fact, according to a  report by the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program, the nation\u2019s transit spending \u201cfell by $9.9 billion in inflation-adjusted terms\u201d over the last 10 years. In comparison with similar countries, America spends a relatively small amount of its GDP (1.5 percent) on public infrastructure, while the UK spends 2 percent, France 2.4 percent, and Australia 3.5 percent.\n The problem is fundamentally that the US is  getting very little for what it builds.\n \u201cDon\u2019t miss the bigger prize here, which is, are we building the right infrastructure, in the right places, for the right reasons. We\u2019re not lacking money here,\u201d Adie Tomer, Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program fellow, argued. \u201cWe need to somehow talk about infrastructure efficiency and project delivery, but there\u2019s also a bigger story here too.\u201d\n Step one is  more data. The research we have on cost is limited by the fact that very little data is collected to figure out what each portion of a project actually cost. If a project is getting federal money, requiring that it provide an itemized list of costs to the federal government is a first step.\n   \u201cThe first is like the most benign thing, which is you should tell us how much a project costs when it\u2019s done,\u201d Brooks told Vox. \u201cAt the moment, the Federal Highway Administration doesn\u2019t know how much it costs to build any individual section of the highway.\u201d\n This isn\u2019t a new idea. As Matt Yglesias  reported for Vox in 2017, \u201csomeone killed a congressional inquiry into America\u2019s sky-high transit construction costs\u201d with no explanation.\n There are also myriad ways the US needs to streamline the process for developing transit projects. Lewis explained to me that European regulators were often shocked that American transit agencies have to go through their own process to get authorization to shut down a street or prepare an area for construction.\n \u201cA lot of the [processes] that we use here in the United States are too slow or too cumbersome and outdated. We need to make it easier to build more and better transit projects,\u201d Lewis explained.\n But cutting down on bureaucracy doesn\u2019t mean slashing government budgets \u2014 while simplifying the rules and regulations that go into developing projects, American transit agencies need to be staffed up in-house to reduce reliance on expensive contractors and build up institutional knowledge.\n Turning to other countries can show how to accomplish some of the country\u2019s transit goals (environmental protection, for instance) without exorbitant costs \u2014 Levy  writes that while the US paves the way for expensive lawsuits, Italy\u2019s equivalent federal environmental law \u201cis enforced by the administrative state.\u201d\n There is no magic button or single regulatory fix that will put the US on the path to a future with accessible, plentiful, and cost-efficient transit. But public fascination with seemingly futuristic forms of transportation like Elon Musk\u2019s  hyperloop dream or a network of high-speed rail crisscrossing the country proves the value of pushing through the bureaucratic and legal morass.\n   Millions turn to Vox to understand what\u2019s happening in the news.

of the big tech companies are effectively curbing the spread of COVID-19 disinformation.\n &#34;It&#39;s exhausting to keep saying this, but none of the tech platforms are doing enough to curb the toxic lies polluting their platforms,&#34; said Luca Nicotra, Campaign Director at Avaaz.\n The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously warned about a COVID-19 &#34;infodemic&#34; that threatens to undermine the global response to the health crisis.\n Avaaz has called on social networks, and the European Union, to tackle COVID-19 misinformation in a similar way to climate change.\n  &#34;We urgently need a &#39;Paris Agreement for Disinformation&#39;,&#34; said Nicotra, &#34;but that requires the Big Tech platforms to agree on a strong Code of Practice that has meaningful commitments and measurable action.&#34;\n  V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, the European Commission&#39;s Vice-President for Values and Transparency, has supported the calls from Avaaz.\n &#34;We must have tools to punish those whose involvement can be proven [of spreading disinformation],&#34; Jourova tweeted on Thursday.\n Euronews has contacted Facebook -- which also owns Instagram -- Twitter, and YouTube&#39;s parent company Google for a response to the study.\n   In their study, Avaaz found 240 pieces of fact-checked misinformation about COVID-19 that were spreading on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Youtube.\n This content had reportedly been liked, shared, and commented on more than 2.8 million times.\n &#34;The big four tech platforms are failing to act on 37% of the COVID-19 disinformation content sample studied in this research,&#34; Avaaz added.\n Overall, YouTube was found to be the worst social network for acting on COVID-19 misinformation, Avaaz said, where over 92% of the misinformation on YouTube analysed by the study had not been acted on.\n Twitter also fared poorly, failing to tackle 74% of the COVID-19 falsities found by Avaaz, while Facebook (27%) and Instagram (7%) had also neglected to remove some misinformation.\n   The video-sharing platform said previously stated that it banned content about the coronavirus that posed a &#34;serious risk of egregious harm&#34; or contradicted medical information given by the WHO and local health authorities.\n &#34;YouTube has long-standing policies prohibiting harmful and misleading medical or health-related content on the platform,&#34; a spokesperson told Euronews.\n &#34;We have continued to act quickly to update our policies related to COVID-19 to better meet the challenges we are seeing on YouTube. In addition to removing violative content, we raise up authoritative information to provide users with additional context.&#34;\n Avaaz noted that fact-checking videos is &#34;more difficult&#34; than fact-checking written posts or images, but said YouTube had had &#34;ample time&#34; to find a solution.\n YouTube said their teams had removed more than 900,000 videos related to &#34;dangerous or misleading COVID-19 medical information.&#34;\n   Facebook has also stated that it shares the goal of &#34;reducing the spread of misinformation&#34;, and has criticised the new study.\n &#34;Avaaz\u2019s analysis does not take into account the more than 18 million pieces of content that we\u2019ve removed from Facebook and Instagram for violating our COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation policies since the beginning of the pandemic,&#34; said a company spokesperson.\n &#34;We\u2019ve also labeled more than 167 million pieces of COVID-19 content rated false by our network of fact checking partners.&#34;\n &#34;There is no playbook for a program like ours and we\u2019re constantly working to improve it,&#34; the spokesperson added.\n Avaaz&#39;s study found that COVID-19 misinformation on Facebook had received more interactions than on any other platform.\n   Social networks have previously been cited for their algorithms, which recommend new content and topics to users and aim to keep them on the platforms.\n Previous studies have said that these algorithms also push social media users towards content containing dangerous conspiracy theories and misinformation.\n But the report by Avaaz has also found that tech companies are not tackling misinformation equally in different languages.\n Nearly half (49%) of fact-checked misinformation content in major non-English European languages is not acted upon, the report claimed.\n That compares to English, where only 29% of COVID-19 misinformation is not tackled, Avaaz said.\n  The group said that most of the misinformation spreading about COVID-19 in Italian (84%) and Portuguese (62%) had not been actioned.\n Meanwhile, Spanish and German speakers were most protected online with measures lacking for only 20% and 21% of false content, respectively.\n In a statement to Euronews, Twitter said that they were accelerating their worldwide efforts to remove COVID-19 misinformation.\n &#34;Making certain that reliable, authoritative health information is easily accessible on Twitter has been a priority long before we were in the midst of a global pandemic,&#34; said a company spokesperson.\n &#34;Since the beginning of COVID-19, we\u2019ve expanded and increased our investment in those efforts. We\u2019ve removed more than 22,400 Tweets and challenged 11.7 million accounts worldwide.&#34;\n Avaaz also noted that the preference of Twitter and Youtube to remove misinformation, rather than label it, could become a risk to freedom of speech.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:36:52", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5df4\u9ece,paris,avaaz", "title": "\u201c\u6211\u4eec\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u201d\u5df4\u9ece\u7684\u8bfd\u8c24\u534f\u8bae\u201c\u201d ", "title_en": "\u201cWe urgently need a 'Paris Agreement for Disinformation' \u201c", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.euronews.com/2021/06/24/social-networks-still-failing-to-tackle-covid-19-misinformation-report-claims", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5df4\u9ece", "paris", "avaaz"]}]
