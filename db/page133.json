The Amazon-owned company declined to comment on the length of the bans or what provoked them, but pointed TechCrunch toward its rules on sexual content.\n It\u2019s possible that both Amouranth (Kaitlyn Siragusa) and Indiefoxx (Jenelle Dagres) will be reinstated Monday, 72 hours after their Friday ban, but both channels remained unavailable at the time of writing. Siragusa  confirmed to Polygon that she was suspended after a stream in which she did yoga poses while making ear-licking sounds into a microphone.\n   The so-called \u201c ASMR-meta\u201d on Twitch, where streamers boost their views by whispering into their microphones or producing licking sounds, sometimes while holding yoga poses, follows the  controversy around hot tubs on Twitch that exploded last month. In both instances, some Twitch creators believe that the platform\u2019s rules are selectively enforced.\n \u201cWith ASMR meta and crazy yoga poses, believe it or not I watched two other girls doing it to the tune of 2-5k views without any bans for months before I folded the activity into ASMR creating the infamous \u2018ASMR\u2019 meta,\u201d Siragusa wrote on Twitter. \u201cThose other streamers are still unbanned and continue to do it. My sin was taking inaction as a sign of tacit acceptance, and then blowing the top off the secret and hitting 30k viewers.\u201d\n Because both the ASMR meta and the hot tub meta were dominated by female streamers, the whole situation has attracted even more misogyny within the Twitch community, where  female streamers are still regularly harassed off the platform.\n I will always find it ENORMOUSLY IRONIC that the generation that fought \u201cviolent video games don\u2019t cause an uptick in gun/violent crimes\u201d(I agree), instantly turn tail &amp; succumb to a bad take like \u201cHOT TUB/ASMR GIRLS LITERALLY CREATE CREEPERS that plague other girl creators!\u201d\n  In a blog addressing the proliferation of women streaming from pools and hot tubs at the time, Twitch wrote that \u201cbeing found to be sexy by others is not against our rules, and Twitch will not take enforcement action against women, or anyone on our service, for their perceived attractiveness.\u201d The company clarified that while a bathing suit in a bedroom might break the rules, \u201ccontextually appropriate\u201d swimwear is allowed.\n  \u201cOur intention with the Sexually Suggestive policy was to draw a line on content that is overtly or explicitly sexually suggestive, not to ban all content that could be viewed as sexually suggestive \u2013 but we acknowledge that our rules are not as clear as they could be.\n Prohibiting every form of content that could be interpreted as suggestive would also result in far more restrictions on the video games and premium content that we currently allow, especially considering the ways that female characters are sometimes objectified or presented in a sexualized manner.\u201d\n Its solution at the time was to create a \u201cPools, Hot Tubs, and Beaches\u201d category where that content could live. Most of Twitch\u2019s categories are dedicated to specific games, with most of the platform\u2019s non-gaming streams listed in the popular catch-all category \u201cJust Chatting.\u201d\n ASMR has its own category with 2.4 million followers, encompassing ear-tingling ASMR streams that don\u2019t push the boundaries of Twitch\u2019s rules with the more recent crop of those that do. So far, instead of building out a more thoughtful way to corral sexually suggestive content, the company is opting to punish anybody who it decides crosses the line. But it\u2019s possible that could all change: Last month, Twitch said it was working on new policies to further clarify the rules on sexually suggestive content.\n Unfortunately for Twitch \u2014 and for the female creators disproportionately affected by its uneven policies \u2014 the abundance of ear-licking streams suggests that until then, the company will be making these same determinations over and over as it tries to draw a line within a gray area of its own making.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 04:16:53", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "asmr,suspends,\u62bd\u6410", "title": "\u62bd\u6410\u6682\u505c\u4e24\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u7684ASMR\u6eaa\u6d41\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u5973\u6027\u521b\u4f5c\u8005 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tTwitch suspends two popular female creators over sexy ASMR streams\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/twitch-asmr-meta-amouranth-indiefoxx/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["asmr", "suspends", "\u62bd\u6410"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "40afbcfce20e042570d284be40d33de8.jpg", "infoid": 1067281, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6839\u636ePickbook\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f532020\u5e745\u6708\uff0cCouchbase\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u6b21\u4f30\u503c\u4e3a5.5\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u91d1\u989d\u4f30\u503c\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6709\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7b79\u6b3e\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ec\u89d2\u517d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\u9996\u6b21\u4eae\u76f8\u7684\u72ec\u89d2\u517d\u3002\n \u6211\u4eec\u60f3\u63ed\u793a\u5b83\u662f\u5426\u5c06\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ef7\u683c\u5e76\u5f00\u59cb\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6211\u4eec\u6316\u6398\u4e86Couchbase\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u8d22\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4e86\u89e3\u516c\u53f8\u53ca\u5176\u5e02\u573aComps\u3002\n  COICBASE S-1\u63d0\u4ea4\u8be6\u7ec6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u9500\u552e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6280\u672f\u3002\u66f4\u5177\u4f53\u5730\u8bf4\uff0cCouchbase\u4e3a\u5ba2\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u63aa\u8f9e\u4e2d\u7684NoSQL\uff08\u201c\u67b6\u6784\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u201d\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u4e0eSQL\u67e5\u8be2\u63d0\u51fa\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\n COICBASE\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u53ef\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u4e91\u4e0a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u516c\u5171\u4e91\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u662f\u5728\u9884\u5b9a\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5411\u5927\u516c\u53f8\u9500\u552e\uff0c\u5728\u5176\u8d22\u653f\u5e74\u5ea6\u7684\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\u5438\u5f15\u4e86541\u540d\u5ba2\u6237\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u53bb\u5e74\u6536\u76d8\u751f\u621010780\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u5e74\u5ea6\u7ecf\u5e38\u6027\u6536\u5165\u3002\n Couchbase\u5c06\u5176\u6536\u5165\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6876\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u8ba2\u9605\u5305\u62ec\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8bb8\u53ef\u6536\u5165\u4ee5\u53ca\u516c\u53f8\u79f0\u4e4b\u4e3a\u201c\u652f\u6301\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u201d\u6536\u5165\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u5176\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u201c\u5408\u540c\u540e\u652f\u6301\u201d\u6216PC\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u63fd\u5b50\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u201c\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\u548c\u6709\u6743\u63a5\u6536\u672a\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u5347\u7ea7\u201c\u5408\u540c\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\n \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u6536\u5165\u662f\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e0d\u8a00\u81ea\u660e\u7684\uff0c\u6bd4\u8ba2\u9605\u4ea7\u54c1\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002 ", "note_en": "According to  PitchBook data, Couchbase was last valued at a post-money valuation of $580 million when it raised $105 million in May 2020.

More specifically, Couchbase offers customers database technology that includes what NoSQL can offer (\u201cschema flexibility,\u201d in the company\u2019s phrasing), as well as the ability to ask questions of their data with SQL queries.\n Couchbase\u2019s software can be deployed on clouds, including public clouds, in hybrid environments, and even on-prem setups.

", "note_en": "The highly contagious delta variant is the fastest and fittest coronavirus strain yet, and it will &#34;pick off&#34; the most vulnerable people, especially in places with low  Covid-19 vaccination rates, World Health Organization officials warned Monday.\n Delta, first identified in India, has the potential &#34;to be more lethal because it&#39;s more efficient in the way it transmits between humans and it will eventually find those vulnerable individuals who will become severely ill, have to be hospitalized and potentially die,&#34; Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO&#39;s emergencies program, said during a news conference.\n  Ryan said world leaders and public health officials can help defend the most vulnerable through the donation and distribution of Covid vaccines.\n &#34;We can protect those vulnerable people, those frontline workers,&#34; Ryan said, &#34;and the fact that we haven&#39;t, as Director-General (Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus) has said, again and again, is a catastrophic moral failure at a global level.&#34;\n The WHO said Friday that delta is becoming  the dominant variant of the disease worldwide.\n The agency declared delta a\u00a0 &#34;variant of concern&#34;\u00a0last month. A variant can be labeled as &#34;of concern&#34; if it has been shown to be more contagious, more deadly or more resistant to current vaccines and treatments,\u00a0 according to the health organization.\n Delta is now replacing alpha, the highly contagious variant that swept across Europe and later the U.S. earlier this year, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia, said in a recent interview.\n  Studies suggest it is around 60% more transmissible than alpha, which was more contagious than the original strain that emerged from Wuhan, China, in late 2019.\n  Delta has now spread to 92 countries, Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO&#39;s technical lead for Covid, said Monday. It now makes up at least 10% of all new cases in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and is on its way to becoming the dominant variant in the nation.\n The United Kingdom recently saw delta become the dominant variant there, surpassing its native alpha variant, which was first detected in the country last fall. The delta variant now makes up more than 60% of new cases in the U.K.\n WHO officials have said there were reports that the delta variant also causes more severe symptoms, but that more research is needed to confirm those conclusions. Still,\u00a0 there are signs\u00a0that the delta strain could provoke different symptoms than other variants.\n No variant has really found the combination of high transmissibility and lethality, but delta is &#34;the most able and fastest and fittest of those viruses,&#34; WHO officials said.\n &#34;This particular delta variant is faster, it is fitter, it will pick off the more vulnerable more efficiently than previous variants, and therefore if there are people left without vaccination, they remain even at further risk,&#34; Ryan said Monday.\n Van Kerkhove said &#34;unfortunately we don&#39;t yet have the vaccines in the right places to protect people&#39;s lives.&#34;\n The WHO has been urging wealthy nations, including the U.S. to donate doses. The Biden administration earlier Monday detailed where it will send 55 million vaccine doses, the majority of which will be distributed through COVAX, the WHO-backed immunization program.\n &#34;These vaccines are highly effective against severe disease and death. That is what they are intended for, and that is what they need to be used for&#34; Van Kerkhove said. &#34;This is what COVAX and WHO and all of our partners have been advocating for, that these vaccines reach people most at risk.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-22 04:10:41", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "covid,fastest,\u75ab\u82d7", "title": "\u8c01\u8bf4\u4e09\u89d2\u6d32\u662f\u6700\u5feb\uff0c\u6700\u9002\u5408\u7684Covid\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5c06\u201c\u6311\u9009\u201d\u6700\u8106\u5f31\u7684 ", "title_en": "WHO Says Delta is the Fastest and Fittest Covid Variant and Will 'Pick Off' Most Vulnerable", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/21/covid-delta-who-says-variant-is-the-fastest-and-fittest-and-will-pick-off-most-vulnerable-.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["covid", "fastest", "\u75ab\u82d7"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d717bfe70c3c158ff7c1f2bea7485287.png", "infoid": 1067278, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Tiktok\u521b\u5efa\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u518d\u9700\u8981\u5728\u81f3\u5c11\u5230\u67d0\u4e9b\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u201c\u751f\u7269\u4e2d\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\u201d\u3002\u4eca\u5929\uff0cTiktok\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u521b\u9020\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u96c6\u6210\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6dfb\u52a0\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u70f9\u996a\u89c6\u9891\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u626b\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u914d\u65b9\u5171\u4eab\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5177\u6709\u6210\u5206\u5217\u8868\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u80fd\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7Quizlet\u6dfb\u52a0\u6d4b\u9a8c\uff0c\u6216\u901a\u8fc7\u547c\u5438\u547c\u5438\u7ec3\u4e60\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4e4b\u524d\u5df2\u7ecf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fc7\u6b64\u529f\u80fd;\u622a\u81f3\u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u7528\u6237\u90fd\u80fd\u770b\u5230\u548c\u4e92\u52a8\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u4f46\u53ea\u6709A\uff06\uff0334;\u9009\u62e9\uff06\uff0334;\u7fa4\u4f53\u521b\u5efa\u8005\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u3002\n \u7531\u4e8e\u60a8\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u9996\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u6b64\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u5904\u66f4\u65b0\u60a8\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u8f7d\u9875\u9762\u4ee5\u67e5\u770b\u5b83\u3002\n \u5df2\u6279\u51c6\u4f7f\u7528Jump\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u5e73\u53f0\u5305\u62ec\u4e0a\u8ff0\u626b\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u547c\u5438\u548cQuizlet\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\uff0cStatmuse\u548cTabelog\u3002\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u559c\u6b22Buzzfeed\uff0cJumprope\uff0cIRL\u548cWatcha\u5c06\u5728\u672a\u6765\u51e0\u5468\u63a8\u51fa\u3002\u6dfb\u52a0\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u5305\u62ec\u7535\u5f71\u8bc4\u8bba\u548c\u7f8e\u5bb9\u6559\u7a0b\u3002\n  \u6700\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u5c06\u662fSnapchat\u7684\u8ff7\u4f60\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u7684\u8ff7\u4f60\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u8ba9\u60a8\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u5b50\u8d2d\u4e70\u7535\u5f71\u7968\u6216\u4ece\u5934\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u51a5\u60f3\u7ec3\u4e60\u3002 WeChat\uff0cMount Messaging App\uff0c\u4e5f\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8ff7\u4f60\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\n \u201cTiktok\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5a31\u4e50\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u5730\uff0c\u201dTiktok\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u8d1f\u8d23\u4eba\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u4e2d\u5199\u9053\u3002 \u201c\u901a\u8fc7Tiktok\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u793e\u533a\u7684\u201d\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u82f1\u91cc\u201c\uff06\uff0339;

Today,  TikTok introduced Jump, a new way for creators to add interactivity to their videos via third-party integrations. So, for example, a cooking video could feature a list of ingredients via  Whisk, a recipe-sharing app. You might also be able to add a quiz via  Quizlet, or breathing exercises via  Breathwrk. The company has beta-tested this feature before; as of today, all users will be able to see and interact with Jumps, but only a &#34;select&#34; group of creators will actually be able to add them to their content.\n This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.  Update your settings here, then reload the page to see it.\n Some of the platforms that have been approved to work with Jump include the aforementioned Whisk, Breathwrk and Quizlet, as well as Wikipedia,  StatMuse and  Tabelog. Others like BuzzFeed,  Jumprope,  IRL and  WATCHA will launch in the coming weeks. Examples of added content include movie reviews and beauty tutorials.\n  The closest competitor to Jump would be  Snapchat\u2019s Minis, which are essentially mini apps that let you buy movie tickets through Atom or have meditation exercises from Headspace. WeChat, the popular Chinese messaging app, also has its own line of mini apps.\n \u201cTikTok has become a destination both to be entertained and to learn,\u201d wrote Sean Kim, TikTok\u2019s head of product, in a press release. \u201cThrough TikTok Jump, we&#39;re creating that \u2018last mile\u2019 of our community&#39;s discovery journey and helping to spark action and deeper interaction both on and off the platform\u201d\n Update, 3:30PM ET: This story originally said that Jumps were now available for all users.
