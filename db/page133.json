Outward was a British  World War II program to attack Germany by means of free-flying  balloons. It made use of cheap, simple  balloons filled with hydrogen. They carried either a trailing steel wire intended to damage high voltage  power lines by producing a  short circuit, or incendiary devices that were intended to start fires in fields,  forests and  heathland.\n A total of 99,142 Outward balloons were launched; about half carried incendiaries and half carried trailing wires.  [a]\n Compared to Japan&#39;s better-known  fire balloons, Outward balloons were crude. They had to travel a much shorter distance so they flew at a lower altitude\u00a0\u2013 16,000 feet (4,900\u00a0m), compared with 38,000 feet (12,000\u00a0m)\u00a0\u2013 and had only a simple mechanism to regulate altitude by means of dropping ballast or venting lifting gas. This meant the balloons were simple to mass-produce and only cost 35  shillings each (approximately equivalent to \u00a396 in 2021  [3]).\n The free flying balloon attacks were highly successful. Although difficult to assess exactly, they had an economic impact on Germany far in excess of the cost to the British government.  [2]  [4]  [5]\n    Because there was concern over what could happen if a  barrage balloon accidentally got loose, in 1937 the British carried out a study on the damage that may be caused by a balloon-carried wire hitting power lines.  [2] These concerns were evidently borne out when early in the year 1940, the Air Vice Marshal of the Balloon Command, the organisation responsible for the barrage balloons, wrote that &#34;Since the outbreak of the war, I have had constant complaints from the electricity distributors regarding the damage done in this country by [barrage] balloons that have broken away from their moorings.&#34; to which he added &#34;...advantage might be taken of this to impede and inconvenience the enemy.&#34;  [6] Meanwhile, in 1940, it was proposed that bomb laden balloons could be launched from France. Their position would be tracked by radio triangulation and the bombs would be released by radio control when the balloon drifted over a worthwhile target.  [7] This plan was never put into action, objections included that &#34;attacks of this nature should not be originated from a cricketing country&#34; and a concern that the enemy might retaliate with similar weapons.  [2] The idea became redundant when defeat in the  Battle of France put possible launch sites out of British control.\n  On the night of 17\u201318 September 1940, a gale broke loose a number of British barrage balloons and carried them across the  North Sea. In Sweden and Denmark, they damaged power lines, disrupted railways and knocked down the antenna for the Swedish International radio station.  [8]  [2] Five balloons were reported to have reached Finland.  [9] A report on the damage and confusion reached the British  War Cabinet on 23 September 1940.  Winston Churchill then directed that the use of free-flying balloons as weapons against Germany should be investigated.  [9]  [6]\n The  Air Ministry initially produced a negative report, possibly because the  Ministry of Aircraft Production felt balloons would be ineffective weapons and would consume too many resources.  [2]\n   However, the  Admiralty took up the idea with more enthusiasm. In particular, Captain Gerald C. Banister, Director of Boom Defence and a proponent of using balloons as a weapon of offence, pressed the point. The meteorological considerations\u00a0\u2013 including the possibility that the weather might favour the enemy retaliating in kind\u00a0\u2013 were carefully investigated and found to be highly favourable: winds above 16,000 feet (4,900\u00a0m) tend to blow from west to east, making it difficult for the Germans to retaliate with similar balloons.  [10]\n Of particular interest was the possibility of damaging Germany&#39;s electricity distribution network by shorting out high-voltage  overhead power lines with thin wires dragged by balloons. Again, the results of investigations were favourable: trials showed that even a thin steel wire, much thinner than that used to tether the static barrage balloons, when drawn in sliding contact across two or more  phases, could cause an arc as long as 15 feet (4.6\u00a0m) and that arc would be maintained until the  circuit breaker opened. In some cases, the arc&#39;s heat could melt the aluminium outer layers and then the reinforcing steel centre strands of the conductors. Even if the cable was not severed, the conductors would be weakened so that they would be susceptible to breaking due to increased electrical demands or normal weather events such as wind, snow and ice.  [6] Investigations revealed that it was common practice in pre-war Germany to use a  Petersen coil as protection against earthing; this design was effective against a short between a high voltage cable and earth but relatively vulnerable to a short between different phases. A short between phases could result in damage, not just to a cable, but to transformers and the circuit breakers themselves.  [11]  [6] The Admiralty ran trials using surplus spherical latex meteorological balloons about 8 feet (2.4\u00a0m) in diameter when inflated. Calculations based on the trials predicted that there would be between a 10% to 75% chance of a balloon&#39;s wire coming into contact with a high-voltage overhead line during a 30 miles (48\u00a0km) transit along the ground.\n Balloons could also carry incendiaries. Large areas of pine forest and heathland in Germany made the countryside vulnerable to random incendiary attack and it was hoped that the Germans would be forced to assign large numbers of people to the task of  fire watching, possibly diverting them from more productive war-work.\n Furthermore, the Admiralty concluded that the balloons could be produced at very little cost; many of the important parts already existed as surplus materials, and despite the needs of conventional barrage balloons, there was plenty of hydrogen gas with which to fill the balloons.  [2] Finally, the balloons could be used with a small number of British personnel who would face minimal risks.\n  The balloons used were surplus weather balloons of which the Navy had a stock of 100,000  [11] all carefully stored in  French chalk. Using this surplus was important to the practicality of Operation Outward because white latex rubber from which they were made  [12] was an important war material that was in short supply. The balloons were about 8 feet (2.4\u00a0m) in diameter when inflated.  [b] They carried a simple timing and regulating mechanism that was based upon a design developed for  Operation Albino \u2013 a plan to use somewhat larger latex balloons in an anti-aircraft role.  [c] At launch, a  slow-burning fuse was lit; its length was calibrated to the estimated time to arrive over German-controlled territory. At first, the balloon rose rapidly and expanded in size until an internal cord tightened, preventing further increase in altitude beyond 25,000 feet (7,600\u00a0m) by releasing some gas; the balloon would then begin a slow descent due to the hydrogen gradually leaking away.  [6] After a while, the slow burning fuse would release a bung in a can of mineral oil; as the oil slowly dripped out, the balloon&#39;s payload would lighten, arresting its descent. The same slow-burning fuse was also used to release the balloon&#39;s weapon.\n There were a number of payload designs designated:  wire,  beer,  jelly,  socks,  lemon and  jam.\n   In the case of the  wire payload, the slow burning fuse would burn through the cord that held the trailing wire. The trailing wire consisted of about 700 feet (210\u00a0m) of   1\u2044 16 inch (1.6\u00a0mm) diameter hemp cord with a breaking strength of 40 pounds (18\u00a0kg). The hemp cord was attached to 300 feet (91\u00a0m) of 0.072-inch (1.8\u00a0mm) diameter ( 15 gauge) steel wire.  [6] Tests had revealed that the main reason for the trailing wire getting caught up in ground obstacles was &#34;springiness&#34; at the end of the wires; this was addressed by obtaining special straightened wire.  [11]\n At the same time as the trailing wire was deployed, a stopper on the canister of mineral oil was released so that it would assist in maintaining altitude by slowly dripping out and lightening the load on the balloon.  [6] It was calculated that the balloon should have a slightly negative lift of about 1 pound (0.45\u00a0kg) so that the balloon would descend until a short length of the wire had its weight taken by the ground. The long length of hemp cord allowed the balloon to maintain an altitude of about 1,000 feet (300\u00a0m) which would reduce the chance of the balloon being becalmed in still air.\n The plan was that the wire tail would be dragged for about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) across the countryside and eventually encounter a high-voltage transmission line.  [6] A phase-to-phase short circuit would be initiated; during trials, arcs 15 feet (4.6\u00a0m) long were initiated by the wire.  [6] The arc would burn for some time before the transmission line protection operated; there was a good chance the circuit breaker itself would be damaged and the conductors might burn through due to arcing. This could cause a line to collapse and require repairs. German efforts to protect transmission lines from attack were unsuccessful: neither a new type of line conductor clamp nor different overcurrent protection settings had any useful effect.  [6]\n    Beer consisted of a cylindrical metal container   8 + 1\u2044 2 inches (22\u00a0cm) in diameter and 9 inches (23\u00a0cm) long containing seven or eight half-pint bottles.  [16] Each bottle was a  Self-igniting phosphorus (SIP) grenade  [15] \u2013 it contained  white phosphorus,  benzene, water and a strip of raw  rubber, two inches (5.1\u00a0cm) long, which dissolved and formed a layer. After a delay caused by a  slow burning fuse, the metal container was tipped open and its contents allowed to fall out. Around the neck of each bottle was a small metal sleeve that held a heavy ball about one inch (25\u00a0mm) in diameter.  [16] The ball was attached to a strip of canvas;  [16] this ensured that when the bottles dropped they fell the right way round.  [17] The SIP grenades would spontaneously ignite on shattering.\n Jelly were cans of incendiary jelly.  [18] Each cuboid can measured about   11 + 1\u2044 2 by  6 + 1\u2044 2 by 4 inches (29\u00a0cm \u00d7\u00a017\u00a0cm \u00d7\u00a010\u00a0cm) and contained one imperial gallon (4.5\u00a0l) of jelly.  [19] A release mechanism and a fuse were provided; on ignition a fireball erupted with a radius of about 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m).  [19]\n Socks were long thin canvas bags of incendiary material each weighing about 6 pounds (2.7\u00a0kg). Socks were packed with  wood wool, bound with wire and soaked in boiling  paraffin wax.  [2]  [17] Each Outward balloon could carry three socks. The whole bundle measured about 27 by 10 by 10 inches (690\u00a0mm \u00d7\u00a0250\u00a0mm \u00d7\u00a0250\u00a0mm).  [19] When dropped, socks formed a V\u2011shaped sausage designed to catch in the crown of a tree.  [2] Fuses were inserted in each end of the device and it would burn from each end for 15 minutes.  [2] In 1941 the Royal Navy had a stock of 10,000 such socks already fused and ready to be used and another 20,000 bodies that could be brought forward as required.  [2]  [d]\n    All the payloads that are clearly code named and described are either a trailing wire or an incendiary.  Small yellow bombs left over and re-purposed from  Operation Albino were also used  [20] and it seems likely that these are identified by one of these code words.  [21] It is possible that the other was used to drop leaflets \u2013 there are occasional, but nonspecific, mentions of leaflet drops in the records.  [2]\n  After a lengthy bureaucratic struggle between the opponents in the Air Ministry and proponents in the Admiralty, the British  Chiefs of Staff gave the go\u2011ahead in September 1941 and a launch site was set up, based at HMS  Beehive, a Royal Navy  shore establishment near  Felixstowe in  Suffolk. The actual  balloon releases took place at the  Felixstowe Ferry Golf Club.  [22] The first launches took place on 20 March 1942. Within days, the British were receiving reports of forest fires near  Berlin and  Tilsit in  East Prussia.  [23]\n The personnel that launched the balloons were six Royal Navy and Royal Marine officers, 80 Royal Marines, 7  Women&#39;s Royal Naval Service (WRNS) officers and 140 non-commissioned WRNS.  [2] The operation also required the assistance of the  RAF Balloon Command (that supplied and delivered the hydrogen) and the Naval Meteorological Services.  [2] The balloons were inflated using hydrogen from pressure cylinders that were brought to the launch site by truck. They were inflated inside three-sided tents or windbreaks. During inflation, it was necessary to keep the latex wet with a water spray\u00a0\u2013 otherwise, friction between the balloon and the tent canvas might have caused the hydrogen to ignite. The inflated balloons were conveyed by hand to a dispersal point, where their payload was attached. Balloon operations could be hazardous, and there were many incidences of launch crew requiring hospital treatment for burns caused by exploding balloons or by mishandling incendiary payloads.  [24] The WRNS were equipped with &#34;flash-proof jacket &amp; hood (\u00bd mica &amp; \u00bd fine copper gauze over the face) + protective cream on hands and fire-proof black gloves.&#34;  [e]\n For security reasons, the Felixstowe launch crews were referred to as a &#34;Boom-defence&#34; unit, a cover story that was partly true as they were put to work maintaining  anti-submarine nets when weather conditions were not right for balloon launches. The Felixstowe golf club site had a number of  Lewis Guns for anti-aircraft defence, which the WRNS women were trained to operate, occasionally releasing balloons for the purpose of target practice.  [26]\n   The British were keen to assess the effectiveness of Operation Outward. Intercepts of  Luftwaffe communications soon showed German fighters were trying to shoot down balloons. This encouraged the British as it was felt that the harassment value on German air defences alone justified Operation Outward\u00a0\u2013 it cost the Germans more, in terms of fuel and wear and tear on aircraft, to destroy each balloon than it cost the British to make them. Later, reports were received revealing damage to electricity supplies and fires in forests and on farms.  [27] Most of these reports were harvested from newspaper reports in Denmark, France and other occupied countries where the German authorities tried to paint the British attacks in an unfavourable light.  [27]\n After the war, German records revealed that the trailing wire attacks had caused the Germans considerable inconvenience with electricity supplies frequently being interrupted and significant damage to the electrical distribution network.  [2] A 1946 report concluded that, based on available records, \u00a31,500,000 of damage was done (approximately equivalent to \u00a355 million in 2021  [3]).  [4] The report also stated that the actual amount of damage must have been far higher because the records were very incomplete with no available records for the Russian zone and all records becoming less reliable after 1943.  [4] The Germans had attempted to record interrupts to the lower voltage lines, but the incidents were so frequent that the recording was abandoned.  [2] In addition to sending up fighters, the Germans used anti-aircraft fire against the balloons, sometimes shut down electric cables when an attack was anticipated, and modified the circuit breakers on high voltage networks.  [2]\n In July 1942, a second launch site was set up at Oldstairs Bay near  Dover.  [23] On 12 July 1942, a wire-carrying balloon struck a 110 kV power line near  Leipzig. A failure in the  circuit breaker at the  B\u00f6hlen power station caused a fire that destroyed the station;  [1] this was Outward&#39;s greatest success.  [6]\n The effects of the incendiary attacks were very difficult to assess\u00a0\u2013 it could be difficult to tell whether any particular fire was caused by  Outward or by an accident, sabotage, or aircraft-dropped incendiary. However, intelligence sources included reports from newspapers printed in occupied Europe indicated that some fires had definitely been caused by Outward.  [27]\n Outward caused damage in neutral countries\u00a0\u2013 on the night of 19\u201320 January 1944, two trains collided at  Laholm in Sweden after an Outward balloon knocked out electrical lighting on the railway.  [1]\n Changing winds could also blow balloons back to the United Kingdom. On one occasion, a balloon knocked out the electricity supply to the town of  Ipswich.  [28]\n  In August 1942, launches reached 1,000 per day, and later increased to attacks involving up to 1,800 balloons all launched over a period of three to four hours.  [27] Balloon launches continued, though they were frequently suspended when there were large air-raids on Germany as it was feared the balloons might damage Allied bombers.  [27]\n From May 1944 it was decided to change tactics because of increased Allied aircraft activity. The mass balloon launches were stopped and replaced with a &#34;trickle&#34; of balloons launched from three sites at ten-minute intervals throughout daylight hours.  [27] Furthermore, only 2% of the balloons were to be of the trailing wire type.  [27] The &#34;trickle system&#34; was not thought to be a significant threat to Allied aircraft so it could go on uninterrupted.  [27] The trickle system simplified the hydrogen supply requirements of the launch sites, and released transport vehicles and compressed gas cylinders needed for  operations against German V-1 flying bombs and for the  Normandy landings.  [27]\n      ^  Sources agree on the total number but vary as to the exact proportions of wire and incendiary payloads, Peebles gives a little more than half to incendiaries,  [1] National Archive records vary slightly but give a little more than half to trailing wires.  [2]\n ^  An eight foot diameter hydrogen filled balloon might be expected to lift 18.66 pounds (8.46\u00a0kg).  [13]\n ^  Operation Albino was a plan to use many free balloons to form an aerial minefield. Each Albino balloon would carry a long wire with a parachute at the bottom and a  small yellow bomb at the top. If an aircraft caught the wire, the drag of the parachute would cause the bomb to be drawn down onto the aircraft where it would explode on contact. Albino was tried out, but was not particularly successful.  [14]  [15]\n ^  If one Outward balloon carried three socks then the 9,644  sock payloads mentioned in the records would have almost exactly used this supply.\n  ^  The figures in the table come directly from a document in the National Archive. The totals do not add up correctly so there must be some errors in the record.

paper  published on Thursday.\n Orbiting a star 400 light-years away, PDS 70c is an otherworldly Jupiter-like gas giant that is particularly interesting to planet watchers. Unlike most other confirmed exoplanets, PDS 70c and its neighbor PDS 70b are not yet fully grown. So much so, when they were discovered in 2018 and 2019 respectively, it was the first time researchers were able to directly image a protoplanet.\n The latest observations have confirmed PDS 70c is harboring another astronomical gem: it\u2019s surrounded by a cloud of gas and dust in which satellites are slowly taking shape.\n   \u201cOur work presents a clear detection of a disc in which satellites could be forming,\u201d  said Myriam Benisty, first author of the paper and a researcher at the University of Grenoble, France.\n  Back in  2019, Benisty and her colleagues suspected they had glimpsed the fuzzy outline of a circumplanetary disk around the exoplanet. Now, they are sure of it after being able to see it more clearly with the ALMA telescope in the Chilean desert.\n \u201cOur ALMA observations were obtained at such exquisite resolution that we could clearly identify that the disc is associated with the planet and we are able to constrain its size for the first time,\u201d she said.\n     The moon-forming disk measures about the same distance from our Sun to Earth in diameter, and holds enough mass to form up to three satellites the size of the Moon. It\u2019s not clear how many moons will eventually orbit PDS 70c, however.\n Astronomers believe that satellites are created in a similar way to planets. Particles of gas and dust collide and glom together to form an accretion disk that steadily gets bigger in size. The evidence for these so-called circumstellar disks, where planets are born, have been spotted around stars, but circumplanetary disks, where moons are born, have rarely been seen.\n   \u201cThese observations are really the first where we\u2019ve been able to truly identify the presence of a circumplanetary disk \u2014 until now we didn\u2019t have definitive proof that these exist,\u201d co-author Richard Teague, a fellow at the Harvard &amp; Smithsonian\u2019s Center for Astrophysics, told  El Reg.\n \u201cBeyond that, we can measure the size and mass of the disk, providing clues on the internal structure and the likelihood of this disk in forming moons. Additionally, as we have such wonderful data on the circumstellar disk, we can put all of these constraints in the context of the larger circumstellar disk to understand whether the environment is similar to those which theories would predict are most likely to form circumplanetary disks.\u201d\n  The researchers reckon that both exoplanets, PDS 70c and PDS 70b, provide good environments to study the necessary conditions for moons to form.\n \u201cOne of this big puzzles in this system is the difference between the two planets. Both planets have been detected in the near infrared, however only PDS 70c seems to have a clear circumplanetary disk around it. We want to better understand the difference between these two planets,\u201d Teague added.\n \u201cIs PDS 70c starving PDS 70b, for example? Could it be accreting all the material from the circumstellar disk before PDS 70b has a chance? Having the opportunity to study one example of a moon forming disk is great, but [the planetary system] is unique in that it allows us to study two, and the interplay between them.\u201d \u00ae\n    With Alphabet&#39;s legendary commitment to products, we can&#39;t wait to see what its robotics biz Intrinsic achieves\n     Alphabet today launched its latest tech startup, Intrinsic, which aims to build commercial software that will power industrial robots.\n  Intrinsic will focus on developing software control tools for industrial robots used in manufacturing, we&#39;re told. Its pitch is that the days of humans having to manually program and adjust a robot&#39;s every move are over, and that mechanical bots should be more autonomous and smart, thanks to advances in artificial intelligence and leaps in training techniques.\n  This could make robots easier to direct \u2013 give them a task, and they&#39;ll figure out the specifics \u2013 and more efficient \u2013 the AI can work out the best way to achieve its goal.\n  Continue reading\n  Bug of the week Google has fixed a bug in Chrome OS version 91.0.4472.165 that surfaced on Monday and prevented some users from being able to login to their systems.\n  Chrome OS downloads updates automatically but doesn&#39;t apply them until reboot, so only those who restarted their Chromebooks to ingest the force-fed broken update were affected.\n  Earlier this week, the internet titan on its Google Workplace status page  said, &#34;Our engineering team has identified an issue on Chrome OS 91.0.4472.165.

"note_en": "Early last October my phone rang. On the line was a researcher calling from Today, the BBC\u2019s agenda-setting morning radio programme. She told me that something strange had happened, and she hoped I might be able to explain it. Nearly 16,000 positive Covid cases had disappeared completely from the UK\u2019s contact tracing system. These were 16,000 people who should have been warned they were infected and a danger to others, 16,000 cases contact tracers should have been running down to figure out where the infected went, who they met and who else might be at risk. None of which was happening.\n  It was an astonishing story that would, in time, lead me to delve into the history of accountancy, epidemiology and vaccination, discuss file formatting with Microsoft\u2019s founder, Bill Gates, and even trace the aftershocks of the collapse of Enron. But above all, it was a story that would teach me about the way we take numbers for granted.\n Now, as the UK tentatively reopens against a background of rapidly rising cases, we are hoping that vaccinations will keep us safe. The vaccines have \u2014 rightly \u2014 been trumpeted as a scientific triumph. Their development and rollout have taken place on a heroic scale.\n But back in September and October, when the UK was also reopening against a strikingly similar backdrop of rising cases, we had no vaccine to protect us. Instead, we were trying to defend ourselves with data. And we didn\u2019t seem to be nearly as enamoured of data as we now are of vaccines. That is a shame, because when you\u2019re relying on numbers to keep you safe, it\u2019s important to put some effort into keeping your numbers straight.\n  The origin of Excel can be traced back far further than that of Microsoft. In the late 1300s, the need for a solid system for accounts was evident in the outbursts of one man in particular, an Italian textile merchant named Francesco di Marco Datini. Poor Datini was surrounded by fools.\n \u201cYou cannot see a crow in a bowlful of milk!\u201d he berated one associate. \u201cYou could lose your way from your nose to your mouth!\u201d he chided another.\n Iris Origo\u2019s vivid book  The Merchant of Prato describes Datini\u2019s everyday life and explains his problem: keeping track of everything in a complicated world. By the end of the 14th century, merchants such as Datini had progressed from mere travelling salesmen able to keep track of profits by patting their purses. They were now in charge of sophisticated operations.\n Datini, for example, ordered wool from the island of Mallorca two years before the sheep had even grown it, a hedge to account for the numerous subcontractors that would process it before it became beautiful rolls of dyed cloth. The supply chain between shepherd and consumer stretched across Barcelona, Pisa, Venice, Valencia, North Africa and back to Mallorca. It took four years between the initial order of wool and the final sale of cloth. No wonder Datini insisted on absolute clarity about where his product was at any moment, not to mention his money.\n How did he manage?\u00a0Spreadsheets. Datini, of course, did not use Excel back in 1396. But he did use its direct predecessor: sheets of paper laid out according to the system of double-entry bookkeeping, otherwise known as bookkeeping alla veneziana. In double-entry bookkeeping, every entry is made twice. (The clue\u2019s in the name.) For example, if you spend 100 florins on wool, that is recorded as a credit of 100 florins in your cash account and a debit of 100 florins worth of wool in your assets account. This extra effort of booking everything twice makes it much easier to detect mistakes. If one has been made, the books won\u2019t balance.\n Double-entry bookkeeping became an essential method for keeping track of who owed what to whom, foreign exchange transactions, profits, losses, everything. It helped Datini and merchants like him ensure nothing was lost, no matter how incompetent their associates.\n A century later, the master of double-entry booking was Luca Pacioli. He was a serious mathematician and a friend of Leonardo da Vinci. But he\u2019s best known today as the most famous accountant who ever lived. He literally wrote the book on the double-entry method, back in 1494. Pacioli once advised, \u201cIf you cannot be a good accountant, you will grope your way forward like a blind man and may meet great losses.\u201d\n We don\u2019t have to accept Pacioli\u2019s insensitive simile to understand his point: life is easier when you can see the obstacles and opportunities around you. Good accounts show us clearly what would otherwise be invisible. But if you can\u2019t keep your spreadsheets straight, you may meet great losses. (More on that shortly.)\n Nearly five hundred years later, in 1978, a student named Dan Bricklin sat in a classroom at Harvard Business School. As he watched his accounting professor filling in rows and columns on the blackboard, an idea dawned on him. Each time the professor made a change he would have to work across and down the grid, erasing and rewriting other numbers to make everything add up. Bricklin knew that this erasing and rewriting was happening every day, millions of times a day, all over the world, as accounting clerks adjusted the entries in what they called spreadsheets: big sheets of paper spread across two pages of an accounting ledger.\n Bricklin was a geek and former programmer who immediately thought, \u201cI can do this on a computer.\u201d As Steven Levy described in a classic mid-1980s feature in Harper\u2019s, the rest was history. Bricklin and a friend called their spreadsheet program VisiCalc. It went on sale on October 17 1979. It was a smash hit soon followed by Lotus 1-2-3 and then, in due course, by Excel.\n For accountants, digital spreadsheets were revolutionary, replacing hours of painstaking work with a few taps on a keyboard. But some things didn\u2019t change. Accountants still had their professional training and their double-entry system. The rest of us did not, but that did not prevent Excel from becoming ubiquitous. It was, after all, easily accessible and flexible, a tool like a Swiss Army knife for numbers, sitting in your digital back pocket. Any idiot could use it. And goodness, we did.\n  Nobody really knows what happened to the 16,000 positive Covid cases that disappeared from the spreadsheet. Public Health England (PHE), a government agency responsible for the process, still hasn\u2019t published anything very informative on the issue.\n \u201cThe suggestion that any cases were \u2018lost\u2019 is simply incorrect,\u201d they told me. \u201cNo cases were missed. There was a delay in referring cases for contact tracing and reporting them in the national figures.\u201d\n That delay was typically four or five days, long enough to render the test result almost useless. If I mislaid my passport just before a holiday and then found it after five days staying at home instead, I am not sure I would triumphantly wave it in the air and declare, \u201cThe suggestion that my passport was \u2018lost\u2019 is simply incorrect.\u201d\n For a contact-tracing system, lost for five days is lost. The question is, how were they lost? Somewhere in PHE\u2019s data pipeline, someone had used the wrong Excel file format, XLS rather than the more recent XLSX. And XLS spreadsheets simply don\u2019t have that many rows: 2 to the power of 16, about 64,000. This meant that during some automated process, cases had vanished off the bottom of the spreadsheet, and nobody had noticed.\n Everyone could see the funny side of the mishap. The idea of simply running out of space to put the numbers was darkly amusing. The fact that Microsoft was never anyone\u2019s idea of cool simply added to the absurdity. Clippy, the maligned automated assistant from Office 2000, began making the rounds as a meme: \u201cIt looks like you\u2019re trying to track a global pandemic. Would you like help?\u201d\n A few weeks after the data-loss scandal, I found myself able to ask Bill Gates himself about what had happened. Gates no longer runs Microsoft, and I was interviewing him about vaccines for a BBC programme called How to Vaccinate The World. But the opportunity to have a bit of fun quizzing him about XLS and XLSX was too good to pass up.\n I expressed the question in the nerdiest way possible, and Gates\u2019s response was so strait-laced I had to smile: \u201cI guess\u2026 they overran the 64,000 limit, which is not there in the new format, so\u2026\u201d Well, indeed. Gates then added, \u201cIt\u2019s good to have people double-check things, and I\u2019m sorry that happened.\u201d\n Exactly how the outdated XLS format came to be used is unclear. PHE sent me an explanation, but it was rather vague. I didn\u2019t understand it, so I showed it to some members of Eusprig, the European Spreadsheet Risks Group. They spend their lives analysing what happens when spreadsheets go rogue. They\u2019re my kind of people. But they didn\u2019t understand what PHE had told me, either. It was all a little light on detail.\n They agreed that the basic problem was that whatever PHE had done wrong, it didn\u2019t have the right checks and controls to flag problems. Or as Gates put it, \u201cIt\u2019s good to have people double-check things.\u201d\n  The original paper spreadsheets were designed to help us not lose our way, and one might naturally imagine the digital spreadsheet is not only faster but more accurate. Is it? One clue comes from a wonderful study conducted by Felienne Hermans, a computer scientist. A few years ago, Hermans realised that there was a bountiful source of spreadsheets she could study. That source was Enron, the bankrupt energy company.\n After Enron collapsed in 2001 amid an epic accounting scandal, regulators extracted a cache of half a million emails from the company\u2019s servers. Those emails are now publicly available and have been studied by researchers trying to understand everything from the evolution of informal written language to the way people use email folders. Hermans was interested in what was attached to some of these emails: spreadsheets.\n She started digging through them, not looking for fraud, but for spreadsheets with obvious errors such as missing or circular references. Looking at nearly 10,000 spreadsheets with calculations in them, she found that a quarter had at least one such error. The errors even seemed to multiply. If a spreadsheet had any mistakes at all, on average it contained more than 750.\n How can a spreadsheet acquire so many errors? Matt Parker, the author of  Humble Pi, a book about mathematical mishaps and their consequences, notes that Excel\u2019s own functionality combined with the mistaken assumptions of users will often introduce\u00a0mistakes.\n Type an international phone number into Excel, for example, and the program strips off the leading zeroes, which are redundant in a mathematical integer but not in a phone number. If instead you type in a twenty digit serial number, Excel will decide those 20 digits are a huge quantity and round them off, turning the last few digits into zeroes.\n Or say you\u2019re a genetics researcher typing in the name of a gene such as \u201cMembrane Associated Ring-CH-Type Finger 1\u201d, or March1 for short, or perhaps the Sept1 gene. You can imagine what Excel does next. It turns those gene names into dates. One study estimated that 20 per cent of all genetics papers had errors caused by Excel\u2019s autocorrect.\n Microsoft\u2019s defence is simple enough: the default settings are intended to work in everyday scenarios. Which is the polite way of saying: Guys, Excel wasn\u2019t designed for genetics researchers. It was designed for accountants.\n But it\u2019s understandable that scientists picked up Excel and started to use it. It\u2019s powerful, it\u2019s flexible. It\u2019s ubiquitous. It may not be the right tool, but it\u2019s the tool that\u2019s right there.\n When used by a trained accountant to carry out double-entry bookkeeping, a long-established system with inbuilt error detection, Excel is a perfectly professional tool. But when pressed into service by genetics researchers or contact tracers, it\u2019s like using your Swiss Army Knife to fit a kitchen because it\u2019s the tool you have closest at hand. Not impossible, but hardly advisable.\n And yet when the genetics research community were wrestling with the autocorrecting genes issue, they resigned themselves to the hard truth that they would never wean people off Excel. Instead, the folks in charge \u2014 the Hugo Gene Nomenclature Committee \u2014 decided to change the names of the genes in question.\n The decision is understandable. But it also neatly illustrates the contortions we go through as a result of treating data as an afterthought, just something to slap together on a spreadsheet. That is a shame, because history suggests that well-managed information can be\u00a0transformative.\n  A few months ago, I asked folks on Twitter if they could recommend some good books about the eradication of smallpox. Most people recommended books about Edward Jenner, who in 1796 was the first to demonstrate an effective smallpox vaccine. That\u2019s revealing, because I\u2019d asked about the eradication of smallpox, and smallpox wasn\u2019t eradicated in 1796. Not even close.\n While eradication would have been impossible without a highly effective vaccine, it also required the highly effective use of information. Or as Datini might have said, it required not losing your way from your nose to your mouth.\n Ever since the vaccine for smallpox was demonstrated in 1796, people dreamed of eradicating the disease. But those dreams kept failing to come true. In trying to vaccinate the entire planet, over and over again, the vaccinators never managed to reach quite enough people. In poorer countries, smallpox lingered in rural areas or neglected communities. A generation of babies were born without any immunity and, soon enough, the disease returned.\n In the mid-1960s, smallpox was still killing two million people a year. The World Health Organization announced it would redouble its efforts to eradicate the disease and planned to do so by intensifying the mass vaccination campaign. One of those leading these efforts was  Bill Foege, an Iowan-born epidemiologist who knew smallpox so well he could detect cases by smell. (Lesion-blistered skin has a distinctive odour.)\n Foege would show up in a village in eastern Nigeria, all six foot seven of him, and the elders would put out the word, Come and see the tallest man in the world! And people did. Foege reckons he once vaccinated 11,600 people in a single day. It wasn\u2019t enough to quash periodic outbreaks.\n Then, late in 1966, Foege received a radio message warning of an outbreak of smallpox in a village about a hundred miles away. He travelled there, found five cases and vaccinated everyone they\u2019d been in contact with. (The smallpox vaccine can still work even if it is given a day or more after people have been exposed to the virus.)\n Standard practice then would be to vaccinate everyone for miles around. But Foege\u2019s team just didn\u2019t have enough doses. Instead, he used radio and the local network of missionaries to spot new cases. Every evening at seven o\u2019clock, they\u2019d switch on the radio and put the word out. Whenever an outbreak was reported, Foege and his team quickly raced to the scene and administered vaccines.\n The hope was to create something like a firebreak, keeping the disease from spreading. And it worked. Using this tactic, Foege\u2019s team eliminated smallpox from eastern Nigeria within six months. It was 1967, and soon civil war engulfed the country. Despite the chaos and enormous bloodshed of that war, smallpox did not return.\n The secret was to worry less about the blanket coverage that was never quite good enough and to worry more about quickly finding exactly where each outbreak had appeared. Eradication was all about information. Up until that point, information had been very patchy. The WHO realised it had been finding only 100,000 or so cases each year against a backdrop of 10 million.\n Foege\u2019s experience showed that public health workers could beat smallpox if they had the data. The strategy became known as ring vaccination. It\u2019s not the same as contact tracing, but it has a lot in common: in both cases you need to rapidly isolate infected people and find their recent contacts.\n Ring vaccination worked. In less than a decade, doctors were scrambling to get to an outbreak in India so that they could observe a case of smallpox before the virus went extinct. The last gasp of smallpox in the wild was in Somalia, late in 1977. Ali Maow Maalin, 23 years old, a cook and part-time vaccinator, astonishingly, had not been vaccinated. He developed smallpox symptoms, was vaccinated \u2014 along with 91 friends and contacts \u2014 and recovered. Maalin devoted his life to the eradication of polio.\n The vaccines were important. Essential, in fact. But so was quickly identifying and tracing contacts at risk. Smallpox had survived nearly two centuries of vaccinations \u2014 but it could not survive a well-run system that targeted outbreaks and tracked potential cases.\n With hindsight, it seems simple. In a way, it was. But of course, keeping track of things is harder than it might first appear. Francesco di Marco Datini could have told you that.\n  One of the striking lessons of the pandemic has been how powerful data can be when handled well \u2014 and how much damage is done when the data are fumbled. Almost every question we have asked about this virus requires the deft use of statistics to answer it. Who has it? How does it spread? Who is most at risk? How can we treat it? Without a flow of good data and reliable ways to analyse that data, we haven\u2019t a hope of answering such questions.\n This is not just a case of having the right boffins solve the right equations. Data do not grow on trees: they must be assembled. An example of this process done right is Recovery (Randomised Evaluations of Covid-19 Therapy). Recovery is a system for running simple but powerful randomised trials of different Covid therapies as an integrated part of the regular treatment of hospital patients with Covid, all over the UK. It was set up at the start of the pandemic in a matter of days by two Oxford academics, Peter Horby and Martin Landray.\n Recovery has produced a steady stream of vital findings, notably that the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine does not help and the cheap steroid dexamethasone is a lifesaver. (How many lives it has saved is unclear, but it\u2019s surely well over a million by now.) It is an example of what can be done when we take seriously not only the data, but the \u201cdata infrastructure\u201d, the tools and the processes we have to collect, manage and analyse that data.\n It is hard to think of a clearer contrast with the misfiring contact-tracing systems in many supposedly sophisticated western democracies. Nature reported late last year that Australia, Washington state and Hawaii were still using phones or faxes to share information about new cases, and that public health professionals from Africa were aghast at the failure of the US system to learn the hard-won lessons of the Ebola outbreak.\n There is more to running a good contact-tracing system than data infrastructure. But without good data the task is all but impossible. As with smallpox, success begins with rapidly figuring out where the virus is \u2014 and therefore, where it might go next.\n Nor has the vaccine rendered contact tracing obsolete. Most people still aren\u2019t vaccinated, and some people never will be. One day there will be another pandemic, and another, and another. We can\u2019t guarantee vaccines will work every time, and vaccines take time to develop. While we wait, there will always be contact tracing. And good contact tracing, like thousands of other good things we want to achieve, requires investing in serious data infrastructure.\n  Let\u2019s say you really want proof that contact tracing works, how would you get it?\n Let\u2019s also say you\u2019re a mad scientist, crazed with power and unhindered by conventional ethics. You\u2019d probably hack into the country\u2019s contact-tracing system, then you\u2019d delete some of the positive cases, making sure that some regions lost a lot of cases and so\n......",

low-earth orbit to provide high-speed Internet to underserved parts of the world, especially places without easy access to cable or fiber.\n  SpaceX&#39;s Starlink beta opened up in my area, so I installed Dishy\u2014that&#39;s the nickname for the large white satellite dish above\u2014and I&#39;ve been testing it and comparing it to my Cable internet.\n I have  Raspberry Pis monitoring my Internet\u2014one on Starlink, and one on Spectrum. And I also have a power monitor measuring power usage. And I&#39;ve tracked everything since day one to see if weather like snow and thunderstorms affect service, and how Starlink compares to Cable.\n Here&#39;s the bottom line: Most of the time, I couldn&#39;t tell I was using Starlink. And that&#39;s good. Everything felt the same.\n But that was  most of the time. I have  eight trees around my house, and there&#39;s literally nowhere I could put Dishy that allows it a full view of the sky with no &#39;obstructions&#39;.\n  Reality hits when I&#39;d notice a page not loading. I&#39;d open up the Starlink app and see &#34;Obstructed.&#34; At my house, that happens for a minute or two, a few times per hour, because of the trees.\n And as pictured above, a recent app update lets it show  exactly where the obstructions are. (Though it&#39;s estimation about the frequency is a bit off\u2014I would have a very brief obstruction (&lt; 10 seconds) every 5 minutes or so, and then a longer obstruction (20-40 seconds) every 10-20 minutes).\n   I live in a suburb outside a large city. Starlink isn&#39;t made for people like me who already have good Internet, but I plan on passing on Starlink to my cousin once it&#39;s available at her farm.\n If I had no other Internet options, I&#39;d trim up my tree for a more reliable connection.\n Starlink is currently in beta, so reviews should be taken with a grain of salt. There are no guarantees, and a lot will change before it goes public.\n If you want the whole story, and enjoy videos, here&#39;s the video I made for this review:\n   First I&#39;ll talk about the Starlink Terminal, nicknamed &#39;Dishy McFlatface&#39;. If you look at the guts inside the dish, it&#39;s a LOT different from a normal passive dish.\n  Dishy is more of a computer with a array of tiny antennae than a satellite dish. And that&#39;s the reason why the hardware currently costs $500\u2014and SpaceX is actually losing money on every dish they sell!\n At Mobile World Congress, Elon Musk said the terminal costs SpaceX over $1000, but they&#39;re working on a new version that could be a little bit closer to $300\u2014someday.\n The dish uses dozens of antennae for  beam-forming, to target a tiny satellite whizzing by in low earth orbit. Then the array locks onto another satellite, and another, and so on.\n In addition to the complex antenna control, there&#39;s also a full modem and basically an entire little computer inside. COSIC, a research group in Belgium,  extracted the firmware from the dish, and found it runs Linux on a 4-core System on a Chip.\n And on top of all that, it also has a self-aiming mechanism that orients the dish at the right angle when you first turn it on.\n  The hard-wired 100&#39; Cat6 Ethernet cable is  technically not supposed to be cut and reterminated. So installation and cable routing can be annoying, especially if you need more than 100&#39; of cable.\n And the dish gets fairly hot in use. Because it houses a computer and a lot of electronics, it has thermal limits that can cause issues in areas with extreme cold or extreme heat.\n The recent heat wave in the US resulted in some Dishies  shutting down after they reached 122\u00b0F (50\u00b0C).\n  Some users watered Dishy to keep it cool, or raised it off the ground more. But luckily I haven&#39;t run into that issue yet.\n I&#39;ll mention more about power consumption later, but during extreme cold, the dish has a sort of &#39;snow&#39; mode where it heats up to melt off ice and snow. And in the one snow storm we got here in St. Louis, that&#39;s exactly what happened\u2014with no Internet dropouts!\n My dish survived four months of every type of weather St. Louis has to offer:\n  Dishy comes with a small tripod stand you could stake into the ground or onto a flat roof, but as I showed in my  Starlink roof install video, I mounted it directly on my asphalt shingle roof using the volcano mount. There&#39;s also a flashing mount and pole adapters available, so you can mount it most anywhere.\n  And... that&#39;s still an open question. Right now, Starlink is being rolled out slowly, by geographical &#39;cells&#39;, around select parts of the world. They can&#39;t roll it out everywhere because the satellite constellation is not yet complete, there aren&#39;t enough ground stations, and satellites can&#39;t communicate directly with each other, so each satellite has to be able to see both a ground station and your terminal to get a connection.\n What this means is you couldn&#39;t just pick up Dishy and drop it anywhere and get service. Each Dishy is tied to a service address, and if you go more than few miles away, you might not get a connection. I tested this at my cousin&#39;s farm, 60 miles from my house, and while the dish could get a few bytes here and there, it wasn&#39;t giving any reliable signal.\n SpaceX  does allow you to change the service address, but the the new address must be in a covered cell.\n But until more infrastructure is built out and a new terminal is available, Starlink is definitely not going to be convenient for travel, like onboard RVs, airplanes, or boats.\n   The other main piece of hardware you get with Starlink is this router. The router isn&#39;t anything to write home about, but at least it&#39;s a halfway-decent wireless and wired router.\n I learned from  TurtleHerding&#39;s teardown that the router runs on Qualcomm&#39;s IPQ4018 System on a Chip, which is  another 4-core ARM CPU, in addition to the one inside Dishy, and it runs a custom build of OpenWRT; you can even see the code SpaceX uses to build the router software\u2014well, at least most of it\u2014 on GitHub!\n I haven&#39;t tried too hard to hack my way into it, but it was fun to see an  ASCII-art version of SpaceX&#39;s logo when I tried logging in over SSH. It even had this fun little quote as the banner:\n  For the astute reader, the quote is a variation on a line from Bee Movie.\n While I was in that deep, I checked  one hop further, and tried to access what&#39;s presumably the Starlink base station, and got this lovely rendition of the Nyan Cat:\n  Jokes aside, the best way to configure Starlink is through the mobile App. If you visit  192.168.100.1 in your browser, you can access some features, like stowing dishy, restarting the router, and seeing connection stats, but that&#39;s about it.\n But the mobile app has all the functionality on the web, and then some: once you sign in, you can manage the WiFi network name, separate the 2.4 and 5 GHz networks, and access all the Starlink support FAQs.\n The router isn&#39;t complicated, which is a blessing and a curse. You can&#39;t get a static IPv4 address, if that&#39;s something you care about, since Starlink uses  CGNAT, but VPNs do work. And you technically can get a static routable IPv6 address if you use your own router and toss out Starlink&#39;s, but that&#39;s not something the average user would care about.\n I should also note that a lot of these things have changed since I first started using the beta.\n I&#39;m happy with the router&#39;s simplicity, and also happy you can use your own if you want. But from a hardware standpoint, there are two major downsides:\n There&#39;s only one gigabit network port on the back, so you&#39;d need a switch to plug in more than one wired device.\n The router is very top-heavy. I don&#39;t know  how many times I&#39;ve accidentally knocked it over. It got annoying enough I  3D printed this base to keep it standing up.\n   The hefty power supply has no problem staying put. Inside this black brick is an understated two-port PoE++ switch, capable of supplying over 100W to Dishy!\n It also powers the router via PoE, so you don&#39;t have to have an extra wall wart AC adapter plugged in for the router.\n This high power rating means it&#39;s doubly important to use the right cabling, especially for Dishy. If you splice Dishy&#39;s wire, use Cat6A or better cable, and keep the run less than 100&#39;, otherwise the power to the Dish might not be adequate, or you could even overheat Dishy&#39;s cable!\n I wanted to see just how much power Starlink uses, especially since people have asked how well it would work off-grid with solar or battery power, and the results were surprising.\n  I popped a  Shelly Plug into my UPS that sends power usage data over my network, then set up my Raspberry Pi to track Starlink&#39;s power consumption, and I&#39;ve been monitoring since day one.\n  The dish plus the router consumes almost 100W of power, all day long. Compare that to the 5-10 Watts my cable modem and ASUS router consume, and it&#39;s definitely something to consider.\n The other thing that surprised me was what happened on April 21 this year. We had a freak late-spring snowstorm with a few inches of snow falling in a short period of time.\n  During the heavy snowfall, Dishy quickly spiked up to 125W, peaking at 175W towards the end of the snowstorm.\n According to support, Dishy has a kind of &#39;snow mode&#39;, where it heats itself up enough to melt snow off the top, and it seems like it automatically goes into that mode when snow starts obstructing the sky.\n Dishy consumes a lot of power. If you want to run off solar power, adding an extra 90-plus watts to your load isn&#39;t nothing. Other satellite-based Internet providers use a bit of energy too, but Starlink is in a league of its own.\n Starlink&#39;s 2.4 kWh of daily power consumption means running Starlink 24x7 would cost around $10 a month, on average, in the USA. That&#39;s about the same as a modern mid-size refrigerator.\n   And I&#39;m splitting this part of my review into two sections: subjective, and objective. You don&#39;t need me to tell you that I can make FaceTime calls, play Halo, manage my open source projects, and watch YouTube all day.\n Because that&#39;s about it, subjectively-speaking. It&#39;s boring, because Starlink is basically what I&#39;m used to: A mostly-online high speed Internet connection.\n But what&#39;s boring to me is revolutionary to some people. My cousin, whose house I visited earlier this year, gets  5 Mbps of download bandwidth, and less than 1 Mbps up. Having 20x faster Internet is life-changing for someone with a low-quality Internet connection.\n The one thing that wasn&#39;t always pleasant was how some software handled dropouts, especially some streaming platforms and video conferencing apps. Since that happens a couple times an hour at my house, I would have to call someone back, or refresh a page and watch an ad again to get back into a stream.\n Most well-known apps like Netflix, FaceTime, and Zoom, handled things well without any incident. It was really the apps and services that are obviously outsourced, like poorly-made TV network apps, that would have strange issues requiring a relaunch.\n Subjectively, I really like Starlink. I&#39;ve been able to leave my iPhone and iPad connected only through Starlink, and I hardly ever notice the obstructions.\n The dropouts have gotten less frequent, too, as SpaceX launches more satellites (which means more sky coverage), and has updated Dishy&#39;s software to be better at switching between satellites.\n  But how does Starlink  really perform? I covered in detail how I  use Raspberry Pis to monitor my Internet. I wanted raw numbers with lots of data over time, so I could form a solid opinion about Starlink.\n  So I&#39;ve been running this Raspberry Pi since the day I installed Starlink, and every 30 minutes, it runs a Speedtest, and charts the result. It also checks for latency, and tracks all of Starlink&#39;s own statistics, thanks to some  code from Dan Willcocks!\n  On average, over the past few months, I&#39;ve gotten about 150 Mbps down, and 20 Mbps up, with 40 ms of latency.\n I could get peak download speeds just over 300 Mbps, and peak upload of around 30 Mbps, and according to Elon,  ping times could someday be as low as 20 milliseconds, but I&#39;m more interested in what I can measure  right now.\n   (The results above were an average for an entire 7-day period.) It&#39;s not a fair fight, since Starlink isn&#39;t made to compete against urban Cable Internet, but then again, I  do pay 1.5 times more for Cable, and while it gives me a lot faster downloads, it&#39;s only a tiny bit faster on the upload speeds, in terms of the upload:download ratio.\n  The best measure of how it  feels, though, is jitter, and using the Request Duration graph, it&#39;s easy to see there&#39;s more jitter, or variation in the response times, from Starlink. But it&#39;s not as bad as I thought it would be.\n If I were a competitive gamer, or was trying to livestream something important, I wouldn&#39;t rely on Starlink just yet. I  did a full livestream on my unstable prone-to-obstruction connection... and it worked! But there were some blank spots during dropouts and times when YouTube knocked down the bitrate.\n   Starlink comes out way better there, since the DSL connection is a paltry 6 Mbps down, and .5 up! 150 down with 15 up, it&#39;s not even a competition!\n  The last thing I&#39;ll mention is the price and contract. Right now, the basic Starlink kit is $500, and the service costs $99 a month. Most people will need another $100-200 worth of mounting gear, and if you want it professionally installed, expect to pay a few hundred more.\n But the contract is straightforward, which is usually  not the case with ISPs in America: unlimited data, with  supposedly no plans to add data caps, and no hidden fees or early termination charges.\n You can cancel any time with a support ticket, and the main catch with the service right now is the fact it&#39;s a beta, so SpaceX doesn&#39;t really have to guarantee any level of service, and the network can temporarily turn go offline at any time for any reason.\n  Before I wrap up, there are two major issues some people have with Starlink, and really any low-earth constellation like it, and that&#39;s it&#39;s impact on earth-based astronomy, and it&#39;s potential to increase the risk of the  Kessler syndrome, a catastrophic increase in space debris.\n But for both issues, SpaceX has been working to mitigate the risks\u2014as much as they can. See my  first Starlink video for a deeper discussion of both issues, and follow the news for updates on both\u2014it seems like every month there&#39;s a new development in these areas.\n And with the potential of Amazon launching their own low-earth-orbit  Kuiper system, these issues must be dealt with, because even if the risk is managed, things that happen in orbit affect the entire planet, not just the USA.\n  My hope is that any satellite-based Internet can be as open and inexpensive as possible, to give people equal access to high-speed Internet, no matter where they live or work.\n To sum up my review, I really like, but don&#39;t  love Starlink. At the beginning, I had thoughts of switching to Starlink and ditching my cable ISP, just because how poorly they&#39;ve treated me as their customer over the years. And Starlink performed well, and their support has been great...\n But the performance just isn&#39;t where I need it  for what I do. If I didn&#39;t have decent cable Internet, like my cousin, that&#39;d be a different story. And judging by many people&#39;s reaction to getting Starlink, it can be life-changing.\n The nice thing is, for now I have two Internet connections at my house, and I&#39;m going to aggregate them so I can get more than 50 Megabits of upload speed.

Just to be clear, using the constant is a very bad idea in almost every situation I can think of. Even instructions like  RCPSS  should only be used by people who are convinced that the tradeoffs are worth it (or don\u2019t have any other choice). Subtracting from the constant above is even worse, and handles even fewer corner cases.\n I\u2019ve been working on a specialised discrete optimisation algorithm, and  perf tellsme that it\u2019s spending around 25% of its time on one (double float) divisioninstruction: the algorithm has to repeatedly compute  x  - 1 for a couple hundredthousand values in a vector. If the denominator was constant, it would be simple tospeed that up. Unfortunately, the only shortcut for reciprocals seems to consist ofcomputing an approximation and refining it with a couple  Newton-Raphsonsteps.\n Surprisingly, it\u2019s still possible to achieve significant speed-ups when as many as 3refinement steps are used: a division unit takes a lot of space, so, unlikemultiplications and additions, hardware divisions can rarely be executed in parallel.I.e., each division takes a couple cycles (around 7-14, according to  AgnerFog\u2019s tables [PDF]), and must wait for the previous division to be fullycomputed. Since I\u2019m dividing a large number of values one after the other,I\u2019m looking for good throughput more than latency, and it can be usefulto perform more operations, as long as they\u2019re executed in parallel or in apipeline.\n The textbook way to compute an approximation of the reciprocal isprobably to use hardware support. On  x86[-64], that would be  RCPSS, whichcomputes a 12 bit approximation for the reciprocal of a single float. Formy use case, I also have to convert to and from doubles ( CVTSD2SD and CVTSS2SD). My Westmere machine can dispatch one of these instructions percycle.\n But then again, it seems like it would be possible to do something like the classic fast inverse square root. Simply taking the opposite value of the exponent field givesus a decent approximation: double floats on x86 (and on most other machines) arerepresented as\n sign : exponent : significand 1 bit: 11 bits : 52 bits (and implicit leading 1)\n The exponent is signed, but represented as unsigned numbers with a positive bias:an exponent of 0 is represented by 1022, and -1 by 1021, 1 by 1023, etc.The maximal biased value for a normal number is 2046 (2047 is used forinfinities and NaNs). So, to get the opposite value of the exponent, it suffices tosubtract it from 2046. That gives us a single bit of precision which, whilesufficient to guarantee convergence of the Newton-Raphson steps, is far fromuseful.\n Instead, it would be interesting to also exploit the significand to get a couple morebits of precision from a subtraction like to-double( a  - from-double( x)). TheNewton-Raphson steps can diverge when the initial guess is too large, so the constant a should be of the form 2046  \u22c5 2  52 -  b, where  b   [0 ,2  52 - 1]. I graphed themaximal error on a range of inputs (2  17 equidistant values between 0 and 3),and it looks unimodal (decreasing until it hits the global minimum, thenincreasing).\n   I want to minimise a function that seems unimodal, but isn\u2019t (a priori)differentiable and is fairly expensive to compute. That seemed like a perfectapplication for the  golden section search (to avoid any problem with floating pointrounding errors, I used an exhaustive search once the range was down to acouple thousand values). I waited a couple seconds, and my REPL spit out 0x7FDE623822FC16E6 for the best value of  a: the max relative error after 3 stepsis on the order of 4  \u22c5 10  - 11 ( \u2248 35 bit), and the average around 1  \u22c5 10  - 11.The convergence rate of the Newton-Raphson methods is quadratic, so themagic constant yields slightly more than 4(!!) bits of precision after a singlesubtraction.\n In the end, going through  RCPSS is still faster, as the initial guess is almost 3times as precise, but on another machine without hardware support for approximatereciprocals, or on which the Newton-Raphson steps execute faster, it might be usefulto keep  0x7FDE623822FC16E6 in mind. Granted, that doesn\u2019t seem to often have beenthe case so far: I can\u2019t find that constant or any value close to it on google.", "posttime": "2021-07-24 07:05:00", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6d6e\u70b9,magic,\u9664\u6cd5", "title": "0x7FDE623822FC16E6\uff1a\u53cc\u6d6e\u70b9\u5012\u6570\u7684\u795e\u5947\u5e38\u6570\uff082011\uff09", "title_en": "0x7FDE623822FC16E6: A magic constant for double float reciprocal (2011)", "transed": 1, "url": "http://pvk.ca/Blog/LowLevel/software-reciprocal.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6d6e\u70b9", "magic", "\u9664\u6cd5"]}]
