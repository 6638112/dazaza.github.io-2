The book will be published on March 2, 2021. In this excerpt, it is the summer of 2008, and SpaceX has attempted to launch the Falcon 1 rocket twice already, failing both times. As the company&#39;s engineers prepare for a third launch attempt from tiny Omelek Island in the Kwajalein Atoll, time and money are running out...</p><p>这摘自《 LIFTOFF：埃隆·马斯克和我们的埃里克·伯格的发射SpaceX的绝望早期》一书的第八章。该书将于2021年3月2日出版。在此摘录中，这是2008年的夏天，SpaceX已尝试两次发射Falcon 1火箭，但均两次失败。当公司的工程师准备在夸贾林环礁的奥梅利克岛进行第三次发射尝试时，时间和金钱都用光了...</p><p>  By the time of Flight Three, the SpaceXers had grown accustomed to their visits out to the central Pacific Kwajalein Atoll for launches. Over the course of three years, they learned how to survive in the tropical environment and even enjoy island life. Some of these lessons were hard won, however.</p><p>  到第三次飞行时，SpaceXers已经习惯了访问太平洋夸瓦林环礁中部环礁进行发射的习惯。在三年的时间里，他们学习了如何在热带环境中生存甚至享受岛屿生活。但是，其中一些教训是来之不易的。</p><p> Fairly early on during the Kwaj experience, engineer Brian Bjelde missed the evening boat back to Kwajalein. It happened. He and a few others slept under the stars, passing a perfectly pleasant night. But the next morning, Bjelde lacked a change of clothes. So he grabbed a T-shirt from a package of Falcon 1 swag items that had shown up in Omelek. The vacuum-packed, white T-shirt may have been wrinkled, but at least it was clean, and it kept the sun off his back. Bjelde went through massive quantities of sunscreen every day—any piece of skin exposed to the tropical sun was covered. Throughout that day, as he slathered himself in it, Bjelde noticed the T-shirt’s wrinkles straightening beneath the island’s heat and humidity.</p><p> 在Kwaj体验期间的相当早的时候，工程师Brian Bjelde错过了傍晚返回Kwajalein的游船。它发生了。他和其他一些人睡在星空下，度过了一个非常愉快的夜晚。但是第二天早上，比耶德没有换衣服。因此，他从出现在Omelek的猎鹰1赃物包中抓起了一件T恤。真空包装的白色T恤可能已经起皱，但至少它是干净的，并且可以防止阳光直射。比耶尔德每天都要接受大量的防晒霜-任何一块暴露在热带阳光下的皮肤都被覆盖了。在这一天中，比耶尔德（Bjelde）身陷其中，注意到岛上的热量和湿气下T恤的皱纹逐渐变直。</p><p>  Late in the afternoon, he went to take a shower. “I took my shirt off, and I had the worst sunburn of my life through the t-shirt,” he said. “I had a perfect sunburn. I think the end of my days will come through skin cancer because of that Kwajalein experience. The sunshine went straight through that cheap white T-shirt. I just didn’t think to put sunscreen underneath it. Why would you?”</p><p>  下午晚些时候，他去洗个澡。他说：“我脱下了衬衫，这件T恤使我一生中最严重的晒伤。” “我晒得很完美。我认为由于Kwajalein的经历，我的日子将终结于皮肤癌。阳光直射穿过那件廉价的白色T恤。我只是不想在它下面放防晒霜。你怎么会呢？</p><p> The heat and humidity punished those on Omelek in other ways. Bjelde had been a California kid, where it sometimes got hot but rarely so humid. And he had never done this kind of physical labor before.</p><p> 高温和潮湿以其他方式惩罚了Omelek上的那些。比耶尔德（Bjelde）曾经是加利福尼亚的孩子，有时会变热，但很少变湿。而且他以前从未做过这种体力劳动。</p><p> Marines out at sea may be familiar with crotch rot, but Bjelde had never heard of it. “I don’t claim to be thin or skinny, and if your thighs rub a little bit, and then you sweat, it leads to chafing,” he said. “But the salty, humid environment just made things worse.”</p><p> 海上的海军陆战队可能对may腐很熟悉，但比耶尔德从未听说过。他说：“我并没有声称自己瘦弱或瘦弱，如果你的大腿有点摩擦，然后出汗，就会导致擦伤。” “但是咸湿的环境只会使情况变得更糟。”</p><p> As he struggled to move around one day, walking bow-legged across the island, Bjelde asked the more experienced Chris Thompson what he should do about his painful ailment. Did he need penicillin, perhaps? Thompson, a former Marine, explained the trick of rubbing underarm deodorant between the legs. And Thompson offered another useful suggestion: switching from boxers to boxer briefs.</p><p> 当他艰难地四处走动，弓着腿走过整个岛屿时，比耶德问了经验丰富的克里斯·汤普森，他应该如何应对自己的痛苦。他是否需要青霉素？汤普森（Thompson）是一位前海军陆战队队员，他解释了在两腿之间摩擦腋下除臭剂的技巧。汤普森（Thompson）提出了另一个有用的建议：从平角裤改为平角裤。 </p><p> The few women on the island faced their own travails. In the early years, Anne Chinnery and Flo Li had little privacy and no running water. Using the island’s toilet necessitated filling a bucket with sea water first so the toilet could be flushed. Showers were even more rudimentary. Initially, the SpaceXers filled a trash bucket with water to wash their hands. When she got really hot and sweaty at the end of a long day. Li said she would put on a bathing suit and dump the rain water over her head to rinse off.</p><p>岛上的几名妇女面临着自己的苦难。早年，Anne Chinnery和Flo Li几乎没有隐私，也没有自来水。使用岛上的厕所必须先向桶里装满海水，以便冲洗马桶。淋浴更基本。最初，SpaceXers将一个垃圾桶装满水以洗手。当她在漫长的一天结束时真的很热又满头大汗的时候。李说，她会穿上泳衣，把雨水倒在头上，以冲洗干净。</p><p> As the Flight One campaign progressed in 2006, the small team moved on from a trash can to a camp shower. They collected rainwater in large, black bags, and then laid the bags out on the helipad to warm up during the daytime. One of these bags would be dragged onto a stand so that it hung over a folding metal chair, allowing for the luxury of a warm shower. For the benefit of Chinnery and Li, a shower curtain afforded a measure of privacy.</p><p> 随着2006年“飞行第一”活动的进行，小团队从垃圾桶转移到了营地淋浴间。他们用黑色的大袋子收集雨水，然后将袋子放在停机坪上以在白天预热。这些袋子之一将被拖到架子上，以便悬挂在折叠的金属椅子上，从而可以享受温暖的淋浴。为了让Chinnery和Li受益，浴帘提供了一定程度的私密性。</p><p>       The engineers and technicians worked hard during the daytime, but as the sun neared the horizon, the crews would often take a break. They’d swim; a few people even skinny-dipped in the lagoon as a final escape from the heat.</p><p>       工程师和技术人员在白天辛勤工作，但是当太阳临近地平线时，工作人员常常会休息一下。他们会游泳；一些人甚至瘦身地浸在泻湖中，以逃避高温。</p><p> Sometimes their efforts at rowdy fun would go awry. Omelek was small enough to walk across in a few minutes, but during later flight campaigns there was an old, raggedy golf cart for employee use. Zach Dunn described it as “serious turd,” hung together with baling wire and bubblegum. At some point between Flights Two and Three, the brakes went bad on the cart, but when the launch team returned from Los Angeles no one realized it.</p><p> 有时，他们在吵闹乐方面的努力会出错。奥梅莱克（Omelek）很小，可以在几分钟内走过去，但是在随后的飞行活动中，有一个旧的，破烂的高尔夫球车供员工使用。扎克·邓恩（Zach Dunn）将其描述为“严重草皮”，并与捆扎线和泡泡糖挂在一起。在第二和第三次飞行之间的某个时刻，刹车失灵了，但是当发射团队从洛杉矶回来时，没人意识到这一点。</p><p> At the end of one workday, as some of his friends caught the boat back to Kwaj, Dunn decided to see them off in style. He hopped onto the cart, parked near the trailers for overnighters and put the pedal to the metal. Dunn thought it would be fun to zoom past his departing friends, honking and waving. He had built up a good bit of speed as he neared the dock, and in preparation to salute the boat, Dunn decided he had better slow down. In a slapstick moment straight out of a cartoon, when Dunn pushed on the brake pedal it went down to the floor without any resistance. He succeeded in getting his comrades’ attention, but for the wrong reasons, as he began screaming and careening toward a small rocky ledge. From there, Dunn faced a clear shot into the lagoon, likely flipping end over end as he went. He made a split-second decision and veered toward a palm tree instead.</p><p> 在一个工作日结束时，当他的一些朋友乘船回到夸伊时，邓恩决定送他们时尚的衣服。他跳上购物车，停在拖车附近供过夜使用，然后将踏板踩到金属上。邓恩（Dunn）认为，拉近他即将离任的朋友，鸣喇叭和挥手很有意思。当他靠近码头时，他已经提高了速度，为准备向船敬礼，邓恩决定最好放慢速度。转瞬即逝，当邓恩踩下制动踏板时，它毫无阻力地下降到地板上。他成功地引起了同志的注意，但是由于错误的原因，他开始尖叫并开始朝着小小的岩石壁架进发。从那里，邓恩面对一个清晰的镜头进入泻湖，可能在他走的时候翻过来。他做出了短暂的决定，转而转向一棵棕榈树。</p><p> “Instead of seeing me waving and honking and being a general goofball, they just saw me drive out at full speed, no explanation whatsoever,” Dunn said of the group on the boat. “Then I crashed into a palm tree at top speed.”</p><p> 邓恩在船上说：“他们没有看到我挥舞，鸣叫和成为一个普通的傻瓜，而是看到我全速驶出，没有任何解释。” “然后我以极高的速度撞到了一棵棕榈树上。”</p><p> The impact threw Dunn over the cart’s steering wheel, but he walked away from the accident. The employees on the boat laughed uproariously.</p><p> 撞击使邓恩摔在了手推车的方向盘上，但他避开了事故。船上的员工大笑起来。 </p><p> Some SpaceXers who stayed overnight fished the coral reefs surrounding Omelek, though they released anything they caught. Small organisms that grow on tropical coral reefs produce ciguatoxin, which accumulates in small fish and in greater concentrations in larger fish on up the food chain. The Marshallese people developed an immunity to the toxin, but it causes severe food poisoning in outsiders. Every now then the SpaceXers would hear a report of a visitor to Kwaj dying after eating a reef fish.</p><p>一些过夜的SpaceXers捕捞了Omelek周围的珊瑚礁，尽管他们释放了捕获的任何东西。在热带珊瑚礁上生长的小型生物会产生雪茄毒素，这种雪茄毒素会积聚在小型鱼类中，而在食物链中的大型鱼类中会更富集。马绍尔人对这种毒素具有免疫力，但会在外人体内造成严重的食物中毒。然后每隔一段时间，SpaceXers就会听到一个关于Kwaj的游客在吃礁鱼后死亡的报道。</p><p> There were natural threats on land, too. Coconut crabs, which can grow up to three feet in length and are the largest arthropods in the world, lived on Omelek. Sometimes, they would be seen scurrying up a tree and using strong pincers to knock a coconut to the ground. Then, back on the ground, the crab would crack open the coconut. “There was definitely no sleeping naked on the beach for us,” said Jeff Richichi, a structures engineer.</p><p> 陆地上也有自然威胁。居住在Omelek上的椰子蟹可以长到三英尺长，是世界上最大的节肢动物。有时，会看到他们在树上匆匆忙忙地用钳子将椰子砸在地上。然后，螃蟹会回到地面上，将椰子打开。 “我们绝对不在海滩上裸睡，”建筑工程师杰夫·里奇奇（Jeff Richichi）说。</p><p> By the time of Flight Three, the Omelek engineers and technicians had continued to refine their environment, especially with better food for those who slept on the island. In the double-wide’s kitchen, they would take turns cooking meals that outclassed the fare in the Army cafeteria on Kwaj. In the mornings, they feasted on steaming plates of scrambled eggs. In the evenings, they mixed it up. Bulent Altan and a new launch engineer, Ricky Lim, did a lot of the cooking because they enjoyed it. It might be grilled steaks one night or shrimp in paprika sauce the next. Altan’s specialty was a Turkish goulash he loved to bake, mixing pasta with garlic and yogurt, smothered in a butter-and-tomato sauce. It proved a crowd pleaser on Omelek. There were other comforts, too. A refrigerated sea van had an endless supply of drinks, including beer for the evenings.</p><p> 到第三次飞行时，Omelek的工程师和技术人员已继续改善他们的环境，尤其是为那些在岛上睡觉的人提供更好的食物。在两人间的厨房里，他们轮流做饭，超出了夸伊（Kwaj）陆军食堂的票价。早晨，他们在蒸盘上盛装炒鸡蛋。在晚上，他们把它混在一起。 Bulent Altan和新的发射工程师Ricky Lim做了大量的烹饪，因为他们很喜欢。可能是一晚烤牛排，或者第二天是红辣椒酱虾。 Altan的特色菜是他喜欢烘烤的土耳其炖牛肉，将面食与大蒜和酸奶混合，并涂上黄油和西红柿酱。事实证明，这对Omelek来说是令人愉悦的。也有其他安慰。冷藏的海上货车无休止地供应饮料，包括晚上的啤酒。</p><p>    “Everything was fantastic luxury compared to the first flight, so we loved it on Omelek,” Altan said. “After the really, really crazy days everyone gathered around at dinnertime and really enjoyed just sitting down and relaxing. We would always watch the same movies over and over again, like  Starship Troopers. The most important thing is that the camaraderie was great.”</p><p>    “与首航相比，一切都非常豪华，因此我们在Omelek上非常喜欢，” Altan说。 “在经历了非常非常疯狂的日子之后，每个人都在晚餐时间聚集在一起，非常喜欢坐下来放松身心。我们总是会一遍又一遍地看同样的电影，例如《星际飞船》。最重要的是，友情极好。”</p><p> The overnighters also built a wooden deck attached to the trailer. From there, they could survey some of the darkest skies on Earth. Oftentimes, clouds obscured their view. But when it was clear, there were a million brilliant stars. Sometimes there were artificial stars, too. They looked like shooting stars but didn’t fade out. Rather, they brightened—because these were intercontinental ballistic missiles being shot from the mainland United States toward Kwajalein Atoll.</p><p> 过夜者还建造了一个挂在拖车上的木制甲板。从那里，他们可以调查地球上最黑暗的天空。通常，乌云遮住了他们的视线。但是很明显，那里有一百万颗璀璨的星星。有时也有人造星星。它们看上去像流星，但并没有消失。相反，它们是光明的，因为它们是从美国本土向夸贾林环礁发射的洲际弹道导弹。</p><p> It was a great irony: the imperative to fly fast pushed SpaceX from Vandenberg to Kwajalein, and once there, the employees had a grand view of missiles launched from Vandenberg. For the better part of half a century, the small atoll had served as ground zero for the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles and, later, President Ronald Reagan’s “Strategic Defense Initiative.” The Army’s facilities on Kwajalein still serve a number of purposes, but the most enduring one is acting as a giant target range.</p><p> 讽刺的是：必须快速将SpaceX从范登堡推到夸贾林，一旦到达那儿，员工们就对范登堡发射的导弹抱有极大的期待。在半个世纪的上半叶，小环礁一直是洲际弹道导弹和后来的罗纳德·里根总统的“战略防御计划”发展的零地面。陆军在夸贾林（Kwajalein）的设施仍可用于多种用途，但最持久的用途却是巨大的目标范围。</p><p> When the Air Force wants to test the accuracy of a Minuteman III missile, it will launch the three-stage, solid-fueled rocket from Vandenberg toward Kwaj. With its sophisticated radars, cameras, and other tracking equipment, the Reagan test site in Kwaj captures precise radar and optics data about the missile as it streaks through the atmosphere at about four miles per second. Often, the missiles targeted Illeginni Island on the western side of the atoll. This means they passed almost directly over Omelek, on the eastern rim of the chain of islands. From there, SpaceXers spending the night on Omelek marveled as these missiles came in. Nearing Kwajalein, the missile’s third stage would drop off, leaving only the missile bus, carrying the simulated warheads.</p><p> 当空军想要测试Minuteman III导弹的准确性时，它将从范登堡向夸伊发射三级固体燃料火箭。凭借先进的雷达，摄像头和其他跟踪设备，位于夸伊的里根测试基地以每秒约4英里的速度穿过大气层，捕获有关导弹的精确雷达和光学数据。通常，导弹对准环礁西侧的伊莱金尼岛。这意味着它们几乎直接越过了岛屿链东部边缘的奥梅莱克。从那里，当这些导弹进入时，SpaceXers在Omelek上度过了一个夜晚。在夸贾林附近，导弹的第三级将下降，仅留下装有模拟弹头的导弹公共汽车。 </p><p> For some of the older hands on Kwaj, the prospect of incoming ballistic missiles rekindled distant memories of the Cold War. Seeing those rockets come in was beautiful but also a little terrifying, knowing that if a real warhead was on board death would be imminent. “The simulated bombs would split off like little fireflies,” Chinnery said. “It was very eerie to see those. It reminded me of growing up and being scared of nuclear annihilation.”</p><p>对于Kwaj的一些较老的人来说，即将来临的弹道导弹的前景重新燃起了对冷战的遥远记忆。看到那些火箭进来真是美极了，但也有些恐怖，因为知道如果真正的弹头在机上，死亡将迫在眉睫。 Chinnery说：“模拟炸弹会像小萤火虫一样分裂。” “看到这些真是令人毛骨悚然。它使我想起了成长，并害怕核毁灭。”</p><p> Another advantage of spending the night in the double-wide trailer was skipping morning rush hour and catching a few more winks. The big catamaran that carried Boeing employees from Kwaj to Meck Island, and then dropped off SpaceX workers at Omelek, was reliable. But it got an early start, leaving the dock at 6:05 a.m. This meant that Buzza’s team had to rise early if they wanted to eat breakfast before riding across Kwaj to the pier to catch a ride.</p><p> 在双轮预告片中过夜的另一个优势是跳过了早上的高峰时间，又多了一些传情动漫。大双体船可以将波音公司的员工从夸伊岛运到梅克岛，然后在Omelek派遣SpaceX工人，这是可靠的。但是它起步很早，于早上6:05离开码头，这意味着Buzza的团队如果想吃早餐，必须早起，然后才越过Kwaj到码头搭便车。</p><p> “I never missed that boat, ever,” Buzza said. “But sometimes, teammates would. The Army is very punctual and would not deviate. Except for one time, they did come back to the dock for Elon.”</p><p> “我从来没有错过过那条船，”布扎说。 “但是有时候，队友会。陆军很守时，不会偏离。除了一次，他们确实回到了伊隆码头。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/03/after-two-failures-spacex-needed-a-win-in-2008-would-it-get-one/">https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/03/after-two-failures-spacex-needed-a-win-in-2008-would-it-get-one/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/成为/">#成为</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/triumph/">#triumph</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/omelek/">#omelek</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
