Did the Internet go out again? Is her computer plugged in? Is the math too confusing? Sophia can’t really answer. She’s too upset, wondering whether she’ll ever learn new things again, fearing she’ll fail the fourth grade and, more than anything, missing her friends. She hasn’t seen a single friend since March, when she was in third grade.</p><p>  她的母亲和姐姐急忙问发生了什么事。互联网又出去了吗？她的电脑插好了吗？数学太混乱了吗？索菲娅无法真正回答。她太难过了，想知道自己是否会再次学习新事物，担心自己四年级不及格，更想念她的朋友。自3月份读三年级以来，她再也没有见过一个朋友。</p><p>  “So I just get really angry and frustrated,” she said. “I cry.”</p><p>  她说：“所以我真的很生气和沮丧。” “我哭了。”</p><p>  Some children are doing fine with remote school; some even prefer it. But many others are like Sophia: They are suffering emotionally, mentally and even physically from so many hours, often alone, in front of a computer screen.</p><p>  有些孩子在边远学校学习得很好。有些甚至更喜欢它。但是还有许多其他方面像索菲亚：他们在电脑屏幕前的许多小时（通常是一个人）中在情感，心理，甚至身体上遭受痛苦。</p><p>    To gauge the struggle, The Washington Post asked parents nationwide to share stories and artwork produced by youths participating in the mandatory home-school experiment, garnering more than 60 responses from families living in 18 states.</p><p>    为了衡量这场斗争，《华盛顿邮报》要求全国各地的父母分享参加强制性家庭学校实验的年轻人的故事和艺术作品，获得了来自18个州的家庭的60多个回应。</p><p>  School-age children are losing interest in food. They are complaining of back pain and burning eyes. They are developing feelings of depression.</p><p>  学龄儿童正在失去对食物的兴趣。他们抱怨背部疼痛和眼睛灼热。他们正在逐渐感到沮丧。</p><p>  It is unsurprising, even predictable, experts say, and likely to get worse the longer school campuses throughout the country remain shut down.</p><p>  专家说，这不足为奇，甚至可以预见，而且随着全国各地较长时间的学校停课，情况可能会变得更糟。</p><p>  “The strain on kids is enormous,” said Matthew Biel, chief of the child and adolescent psychiatry division at Georgetown University School of Medicine. “Your 7-year-old wants to be recognized when they raise their hand. Oftentimes doesn’t happen on Zoom. They want to be able to make a comment, make a joke with a peer — can’t do that, no chatting allowed. Wants to be able to get up and walk around the classroom and move — can’t do that, we need to see your face on screen.”</p><p>乔治敦大学医学院儿童和青少年精神病学科主任马修·比尔（Matthew Biel）说：“对孩子的压力很大。” “您7岁的孩子举手时希望得到认可。通常，缩放不会发生。他们希望能够发表评论，与同伴开玩笑-不能那样做，不允许聊天。希望能够起身在教室里走来走去-无法做到，我们需要在屏幕上看到你的脸。”</p><p>  He said it can be particularly hard for children with special needs, developmental delays or social struggles, but it can also be challenging for youths who simply crave friendship and the comfort of school rituals.</p><p>  他说，对于有特殊需要，发育迟缓或社会斗争的孩子来说，这可能特别困难，但对于那些只渴望友谊和享受学校礼节的年轻人来说，这也可能是一个挑战。</p><p>  Especially for younger children, Biel said, the only way to express shock, sadness and displeasure is through emotional, sometimes violent outbursts and tantrums. And, although parents across the United States are rushing to reassure their children, they cannot provide the one answer that would help most — telling children when the pandemic will be over.</p><p>  比尔说，尤其是对于年幼的孩子，表达震惊，悲伤和不满的唯一途径是情绪激动，有时是暴力爆发和发脾气。而且，尽管美国各地的父母都在努力让孩子放心，但他们无法提供最有帮助的答案-告诉孩子大流行病何时结束。</p><p>  “This is just how life is now,” Biel said. “None of us can really share with our kids when it is going to end. We don’t know.”</p><p>  “这就是现在的生活，”比尔说。 “快要结束时，我们谁也不能真正与孩子们分享。我们不知道。”</p><p>              It starts when the 12-year-old pulls on his uniform: white button-down shirt, gray slacks, blazer and tie, as mandated by his New York City private school. Then he sits down on his bed, where he will spend the next six hours attending an almost unbroken string of Zoom classes.</p><p>              从12岁的男孩穿上他的制服开始：他的纽约纽西兰私立学校要求穿白色纽扣衬衫，灰色休闲裤，西装外套和领带。然后他坐在床上，接下来的六个小时里，他将参加一系列几乎不间断的Zoom课程。</p><p>    Two hours in, his neck starts to bother him. His muscles feel strained, stretched. Holding his head in the same position for so long is unnatural, just plain wrong.</p><p>    两个小时后，他的脖子开始打扰他。他的肌肉感到紧张，舒展。长时间将头保持在同一姿势是不自然的，只是完全错误的。</p><p>    But the worst is when his eyes start to water and itch, which they almost always do. Creedence rubs them, and that helps, but within seconds they hurt worse. Soon they’re bloodshot, so ghastly looking that his parents at one point tested him for pinkeye — but no, it was just from staring at a screen for so long.</p><p>    但最糟糕的是，他的眼睛开始流泪发痒，而他们几乎总是这样做。诚信会磨擦他们，这是有帮助的，但是在几秒钟之内，他们会感到更糟。很快，他们就充满了血腥，如此阴森恐怖的表情使他的父母在某一时刻对他进行了红眼测试-但没有，仅仅是因为盯着屏幕看了这么长时间。</p><p>    One room over, his 8-year-old sister, Piper, who attends Zoom classes while in her bedroom, usually starts feeling lightheaded at Hour 3. Her eyes begin burning around then, too. She takes every one of the “stretch breaks” her school offers, but what she would really like to do is run out to the playground for a game of tag.</p><p>在一个房间里，他8岁的姐姐Piper在卧室里参加Zoom课程时，通常在第3小时开始感到头昏眼花。那时，她的眼睛也开始发红。她参加了学校提供的每一次“延长休息时间”，但她真正想做的是跑到操场上玩标记游戏。</p><p>  That, Piper is sure, would make her feel better — or at least closer to how she used to feel before the pandemic, back when she woke up every morning feeling happy. There wasn’t a particular reason, she said. She just remembers being excited for the day.</p><p>  派珀（Piper）确信，那会让她感觉好些，或者至少接近大流行之前的感觉，每天早晨醒来时都会感到幸福。她说，没有特别的原因。她只记得那天很兴奋。</p><p>  That almost never happens now. Instead, “you get frustrated and furious,” Piper said. “Like, you don’t want to look at a screen. You don’t want to be at online school. You start crying.”</p><p>  现在几乎从未发生过。相反，“您会感到沮丧和愤怒，”派珀说。 “就像，您不想看屏幕。您不想在网上学校。你开始哭了。”</p><p>  Creedence said he is just as frustrated as his sister. He would like to complain about school to his friends — in online chats, because he can’t see them in person — but so many of his friends have moved away. There was the family that left for Florida, and the twins, once his best friends, who now live in the Hamptons. Their parents decided they didn’t like New York anymore, Creedence said.</p><p>  Creedence说他和姐姐一样沮丧。他想向朋友抱怨上学-在网上聊天中，因为他看不到他们-但是他的很多朋友都搬走了。有一家人去了佛罗里达，而双胞胎曾经是他最好的朋友，现在住在汉普顿。 Creedence说，他们的父母认为他们不再喜欢纽约了。</p><p>  Piper misses her soccer team. Creedence misses the doughnut shop across the street, which recently shut down because of a lack of customers.</p><p>  派珀（Piper）想念她的足球队。 Creedence错过了马路对面的甜甜圈店，最近由于缺乏顾客而关闭了。</p><p>  When things get too sad or weird, the siblings like to lose themselves in video games. The nice thing about a video game, Creedence said, is that it lets you shape the world the way you want it to look — or, he clarified, the way you need it to look.</p><p>  当事情变得太悲伤或怪异时，兄弟姐妹会喜欢在视频游戏中迷失自己。 Creedence说，关于视频游戏的一件好事是，它可以让您以自己想要的外观塑造世界，或者，他澄清了，您需要它的外观。</p><p>    “We might never be able to go back to some of our favorite restaurants, because they closed down, and we might never really see our friends again, because they moved away,” Creedence said. “This may never get back to normal.”</p><p>    “我们可能永远无法回到我们最喜欢的一些餐馆，因为他们关门了，我们可能再也见不到我们的朋友了，因为他们搬走了，” Creedence说。 “这可能永远不会恢复正常。”</p><p>            At the start of the school year, Karen James tried to make things as normal as she could for her 7-year-old daughter, Olivia Gabriela James. She took first-day-of-school photos and dressed her up in nice school clothes. Olivia was right on time to her at-home workstation, in the dining room of the family’s home in Alexandria, Va.</p><p>在学年开始时，凯伦·詹姆斯（Karen James）试图使自己7岁的女儿奥利维亚·加布里埃拉·詹姆斯（Olivia Gabriela James）变得尽可能正常。她拍摄了开学第一天的照片，并穿着漂亮的校服打扮自己。奥利维亚（Olivia）准时到达了她位于弗吉尼亚州亚历山大市（Alexandria）家庭住宅餐厅的家庭工作站。</p><p>  But as time went by, James found there were holes she could not fill. Sometimes the mother felt helpless.</p><p>  但是随着时间的流逝，詹姆斯发现自己无法填补那些空白。有时母亲感到无助。</p><p>  “Hands tied, I can’t change anything myself,” she thought. “And I’m doing the best that I can. Right? Which on some days doesn’t seem good enough.”</p><p>  她想：“双手被绑住了，我自己什么也不能改变。” “而且我正在尽力而为。对？有时候似乎还不够好。”</p><p>  A single mom, James had to balance helping her daughter with her own demanding work-from-home responsibilities.</p><p>  詹姆斯是个单身母亲，不得不在帮助女儿和要求自己在家工作的工作之间取得平衡。</p><p>    Olivia complained about technology (“It’s glitchy”) and missing her friends (“It’s really hard”). She longed to be in the same room with her teacher. The death of  George Floyd added a layer of pain that Olivia, who is Black, is barely able to process. The second-grader glimpsed some of the news footage, and her mother felt forced to talk with her about injustices years before she would have liked.</p><p>    奥利维亚（Olivia）抱怨技术（“小故障”）并想念她的朋友（“这真的很难”）。她渴望和她的老师在同一个房间。乔治·弗洛伊德（George Floyd）的去世使布​​莱克（Olivia）几乎无法承受痛苦。这位二年级学生瞥见了一些新闻镜头，她的母亲被迫在她不愿意的几年前与她谈论不公正现象。</p><p>  “George Floyd died, and it just made me really sad, upset,” Olivia said. She knows exactly what happened. “The officer put his knee in his neck so he couldn’t breathe.”</p><p>  奥利维亚说：“乔治·弗洛伊德（George Floyd）去世了，这让我非常难过，沮丧。”她确切地知道发生了什么。 “军官将膝盖放在脖子上，所以他无法呼吸。”</p><p>  The hardest blow came just before Olivia’s birthday, on Aug. 2, when James had to tell Olivia that her grandfather would not be coming to the house for her party. He comes every year, so when James told her daughter that he wouldn’t be showing up this year, she feared Olivia would think it was a trick, setting up some kind of super-special surprise.</p><p>  最严重的打击发生在8月2日奥利维亚（Olivia）生日前夕，当时詹姆斯不得不告诉奥利维亚（Olivia）她的祖父不会来参加她的聚会。他每年都会来，所以当詹姆斯告诉女儿他今年不会参加时，她担心奥利维亚会认为这是一个把戏，给人一种特别的惊喜。</p><p>  “No, baby, really, this time Grandpa can’t come from Florida,” she told her. “It’s real.”</p><p>她告诉她：“不，宝贝，真的，这次爷爷不能从佛罗里达来。” “它是真实的。”</p><p>  Olivia was in tears. So was her grandfather, leaving James forced to comfort both her father and daughter.</p><p>  奥利维亚哭了。她的祖父也是如此，詹姆斯被迫安慰父亲和女儿。</p><p>  “I just think about the long term and how it will affect her academically as well as emotionally, and I try to give as many hugs and kisses and support as I can,” James said. “And I tell her, you know, we’re all doing this, like everyone in America this is happening to right now. But I wonder sometimes, you know — am I just talking over her head? So [I] just try to love on her, the best I can.”</p><p>  詹姆斯说：“我只是考虑长远的因素，以及它将如何影响她的学业和情感上，我会尽可能地给予拥抱，亲吻和支持。” “而且我告诉她，你知道，我们正在做这件事，就像美国每个人一样，这正在发生。但是我不知道有时候，你知道吗？我只是在谈论她的头吗？所以[我]尽力去爱她。</p><p>            Luke Pages, 12, has a lot of trouble guessing how his days are going to go.</p><p>            12岁的卢克·佩奇斯（Luke Pages）在猜测自己的日子将会如何时遇到了很多麻烦。</p><p>  Not because of online school — that’s predictable. He knows how many 15-minute screen breaks to expect. He knows he will be taught by seven teachers over the course of the week. And he knows exactly how tired he will be — and how much his head will hurt — by the third Zoom class.</p><p>  不是因为在线学校-这是可以预见的。他知道需要等待15分钟的屏幕中断时间。他知道一周中将有七名老师教他。而且他确切地知道第三堂Zoom课将使他感到疲劳，以及头部受伤多少。</p><p>    “Emotions” is not a word Luke used a lot pre- coronavirus. The sixth-grader, who lives in Gaithersburg, Md., with his parents and little brother, Ethan, never spent time thinking about how he was feeling before. The answer was almost always “good.”</p><p>    卢克（Luke）使用了很多冠状病毒前病毒，这不是一个词。六年级的学生与父母和弟弟伊桑（Ethan）一起住在马里兰州的盖瑟斯堡，从没花时间思考过自己的感受。答案几乎总是“好”。</p><p>  He is still happy, sometimes. But that sense of well-being has an expiration date now, and he never knows how long it will last. On good days, an hour. On not-so-good days, 10 minutes.</p><p>  有时他仍然很快乐。但是这种幸福感现在有一个有效期，他永远不知道它能持续多久。在好日子里，一个小时。在不太好的日子里，十分钟。</p><p>      “I don’t know why,” Luke said. “It’s like a roller coaster of emotions.”</p><p>“我不知道为什么，”卢克说。 “这就像情绪的过山车。”</p><p>  Ethan, who is in fifth grade, has come up with his own words to describe what is happening inside his head. “Big feelings,” he calls it.</p><p>  五年级的伊桑（Ethan）用自己的话来描述脑海中正在发生的事情。 “大感动，”他这样称呼。</p><p>  “I am feeling very sad and angry,” Ethan said. “Sad because I can’t see my friends and the people I miss. Angry because I have to see the same people, including my annoying brother.”</p><p>  “我感到非常悲伤和愤怒，”埃森说。 “很遗憾，因为我看不到我的朋友和我想念的人。生气是因为我必须见到同样的人，包括我讨厌的兄弟。”</p><p>  He also wishes he could see his teachers in person. Watching them on Zoom is “fine,” but the 10-year-old sometimes feels as if his teachers are not really his teachers — and he’s not a real fifth-grader — because he has never actually set foot in a classroom.</p><p>  他还希望他能亲自见到他的老师。在Zoom上观看他们“很好”，但是10岁的他有时觉得自己的老师不是真正的老师，而且他也不是真正的五年级学生，因为他从未真正踏过教室。</p><p>  Ethan has questions about his lessons, and he doesn’t know how to put them into words that will make sense in an online chat or an email, which is the only way to win private time with the teacher. He would like to walk up to his teacher and explain his confusion with his hands. Sometimes, especially when school is hard, he closes his eyes and imagines doing that.</p><p>  伊桑（Ethan）对自己的课程有疑问，他不知道该如何将这些单词变成在线聊天或电子邮件中有意义的单词，这是与老师一起度过私人时间的唯一途径。他想走向老师，并用双手解释自己的困惑。有时，特别是在学校刻苦学习的时候，他闭上了眼睛，幻想着这样做。</p><p>  Luke, meanwhile, daydreams about something he always took for granted — the several-minute slices between every lesson. Back in real school, that is when he walked the hallways with his friends, headed for the next classroom. He can’t remember what they talked about — just random stuff, probably. Now, he can’t even see his friends’ faces, because not everybody likes to turn their cameras on for Zoom class.</p><p>  同时，卢克（Luke）幻想着自己总是想当然的事情-每节课之间的几分钟。回到真正的学校时，就是当他和朋友一起走过走廊，前往下一间教室时。他不记得他们在说什么-可能只是随机的东西。现在，他甚至看不到朋友的脸，因为不是每个人都喜欢打开相机进行变焦课程。</p><p>  Although the rest of his emotions have gone haywire, the 12-year-old said there is one feeling he can always count on: The end of every school day brings the same exhaustion and disappointment. If Luke could just go play football with his best friend after school, the way he used to, that might make him feel better. Instead, he’s developed a mantra.</p><p>  尽管他的其余情绪已变得一团糟，但这位12岁的年轻人说，他总是可以依靠的一种感觉：每个上学日的结束都带来同样的疲惫和失望。如果卢克放学后可以和他最好的朋友一起踢足球，就像他以前那样，那会让他感觉更好。相反，他发展了口头禅。</p><p>  “We’re all in this together,” he tells himself. “We will get through it.”</p><p>他告诉自己：“我们在一起。” “我们将克服它。”</p><p>            Sophia Sanchez in Los Angeles knows who she would like to tell about everything going wrong with her life — her best friend, Sofia, who shares her name and whom she has known since first grade. Before the pandemic, she and Sofia were working on an illustrated book about a spy. They drew side by side at recess, unfolding new details of the plot with every picture. And they talked — about school, what was happening that day, how it made them feel.</p><p>            洛杉矶的索菲娅·桑切斯（Sophia Sanchez）知道她想告诉她一生中所有不幸的事情-她最好的朋友索非亚（Sofia）与她共享名字，并且自一年级起就认识她。大流行之前，她和索非亚正在写一本关于间谍的插图书。他们在凹处并排画着，每张照片都展现了情节的新细节。他们谈论了-关于学校，那天发生的事情，它给他们的感觉如何。</p><p>  Sofia is the only friend Sophia has spoken to since school shut down. But her mother doesn’t have Sofia’s mother’s number, so Sophia messages Sofia through the chat function of an online game they both play. It’s okay, Sophia said, but it doesn’t really feel like she’s talking to her best friend.</p><p>  自学校关闭以来，索非亚是索菲亚唯一的朋友。但是她的母亲没有索非亚的母亲的电话，因此索菲亚通过双方都玩的在线游戏的聊天功能向索非亚发送消息。没关系，索菲亚说，但实际上并没有感觉到她正在和最好的朋友聊天。</p><p>  If the coronavirus were somehow gone tomorrow, that’s who Sophia would want to see first. She would march straight back to normal school. She would head for the monkey bars, where she would race Sofia, just like before.</p><p>  如果明天冠状病毒消失了，那就是索菲亚（Sophia）最想见的人。她将直奔正规学校。就像以前一样，她将前往猴子酒吧，在那里她将参加索非亚比赛。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/11/27/remote-learning-emotional-toll">https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/11/27/remote-learning-emotional-toll</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/孩子/">#孩子</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/school/">#school</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/学校/">#学校</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
