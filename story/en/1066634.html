This one is another tale of Digital, but for it we need to go back a decade earlier. Back to 1986 when I joined the company, fresh out of college.</p><p>我在20世纪90年代后期的数字设备公司（DEC）之前的关于我的时间之前写的，致力于建立一个灾难性的激励计划来构建alpha工作站。这是数字的另一个故事，但我们需要早些时候回复十年。回到1986年我加入公司时，清新大学。</p><p> I grew up in the late 70s/early 80s, idolizing DEC. It was the cool computer tech company that had produced the  PDP-8 mini, which I learned to program on, and later the  VAX 11/780, which I had used in some of my earliest computer courses I took while still in high school. Thinking they were the best computer company may have been  primacy bias on my part, perhaps. But there was no debating that Digital was a dominant force in the market, holding the number two computer manufacturer spot, behind IBM, and a desirable place for a new engineer to work.</p><p> 我在70年代后期/ 80年代初期长大，偶然地崇拜DEC。它是酷电脑科技公司，生产了PDP-8迷你，我学会了编程，后来vax 11/780，我在我最早的计算机课程中使用的是我仍然在高中。思考他们是最好的计算机公司可能是我的首要偏见，也许是。但是，没有辩论数字是市场上的主要力量，持有两位电脑制造商现货，后面IBM，以及一个新工程师工作的理想地点。</p><p> But by the time I was a Senior in college, it was strangely not I that went looking for a job at DEC; it was DEC that found me. I had in fact “uneven” grades let’s say, and I was really just searching to find a job of any sort, as graduation neared. As fate would have it though, a school alumni who worked at Digital came by, looking for a college hire. The professor who’s lab I worked in recommended me, and the next thing you know, I was renting my first car, to drive out to Shrewsbury, Massachusetts for an interview.</p><p> 但是，当我是大学里的一名前辈时，它奇怪地不是在DEC寻找工作;这是Dec，发现了我。事实上，我有“不平衡”的成绩让我们说，我真的只是在寻找任何排序的工作，因为附近的毕业。然而，作为命运会有它，校友在数字化的学校校友来了，寻找大学雇用。我在建议我工作的教授，以及你所知道的下一件事，我租了我的第一辆车，开车去什鲁斯伯里，马萨诸塞州接受采访。</p><p> I was worried about having to explain some of my grades, but the subject, luckily, never came up. They asked a few digital logic questions which I could definitely handle, and they were very interested in my senior design project, a microprocessor-based LAN/router I had built that later won best project at the school that year. (Having that project to talk about was definitely a lifesaver and welcome distraction from explaining my calculus woes!)</p><p> 我很担心不得不解释我的一些成绩，但幸运的是，幸运的是，永不出现。他们询问了一些我可以肯定处理的数字逻辑问题，他们对我的高级设计项目非常感兴趣，这是一个基于微处理器的LAN /路由器，我曾在那年赢得了学校的最佳项目。 （让这个项目谈论是绝对是救星，欢迎分散解释我的微积分！）</p><p> They made me an offer the next day, and there was absolutely no debate in my head about taking it. So I went to work at my dream company, and I still remember the feeling of walking into work on day one and seeing my office and name plate, with brand new  VAXcluster-connected  VT100 terminal of my own ready for me, and thinking  “Holy shit, I’m working for Digital!”</p><p> 他们第二天给了我一个报价，我的脑袋里绝对没有辩论。所以我去了我的梦想公司工作，我仍然记得在第一天走进工作的感觉，看到我的办公室和铭牌，用全新的vaxcluster连接的vt100终端，我自己为我做好准备，并思考“圣洁”狗屎，我正在为数字工作！“</p><p> I got an apartment about a mile down the road from the plant, but on day one in ESD, I learned that my assigned project was actually going to be at the office in Littleton, Massachusetts, 25 miles to the north. DEC of the day was this giant, spreading organism with offices sprouting up on an almost weekly basis in one town or another in the western suburbs of Boston. Inter-office hopping was common, and DEC would pay mileage for people who had to travel, and even had a fleet of helicopters to shuttle people around.</p><p> 我从工厂的道路上有一个公寓，但在伊斯州的一天，我得知我的指定项目实际上将在马萨诸塞州的利特尔顿的办公室，到达北部25英里。这一天的十二年巨人是这个巨人，在波士顿西郊的一个城镇或另一个城镇的几乎每周出现的办事处传播有机体。办公室跳跃是普遍的，DEC会为那些不得不旅行的人支付里程，甚至有一支直升机队伍穿梭人。</p><p> Our ESD division in Shrewsbury had the job of designing the memory systems (dynamic ram) for all of DEC’s products. My group worked on the main memory systems for VAX mainframes, which at the time were very complex beasts with a lot of specialized hardware for controlling things like interleaving, error detection and correction, self-test diagnostics, and ram refresh handling.</p><p> 我们在什鲁斯伯里的ESD师为所有DEC产品设计了设计内存系统（动态RAM）的工作。我的小组在vax大型机的主要内存系统上工作，当时是非常复杂的野兽，具有很多专用硬件，用于控制交错，错误检测和校正，自检诊断和RAM刷新处理等内容。 </p><p>  Later as computers became smaller, a lot of this specialized memory hardware was either not needed, or incorporated into ICs, and memory systems for computers in general became a commodity. By the time of my adventures in the Alpha workstations group in the 90’s, there would no longer be a centralized storage group at DEC, for memory design anyway, and this idea that hardware could become a commodity had stuck in my head and was pushing me to (eventually) move to a software career.</p><p>后来随着计算机变得更小，不需要许多专用内存硬件，或者包含在IC中，并且一般的计算机的存储器系统成为商品。到了90年代Alpha工作站集团冒险的时间，无论如何，在DEN中，将不再是一个集中存储组，而且硬件可能成为商品的想法已经困在我的头上并推动了我（最终）搬到软件职业。</p><p> 1986 was a different matter. Our ESD group then was busy working on many products across the company, including several very large and as it turns out, competing mainframe designs. I would drive up to Littleton every day to work on my assigned product, which was a new VAX mainframe code-named “Argonaut”. This was to be a third-generation offering from the Midrange Systems Business (MSB) division of DEC, which had previously designed and built the  VAX 8800 series.</p><p> 1986年是一个不同的物质。然后我们的ESD集团正在忙于整个公司的许多产品，包括几个非常大的，并且事实证明，竞争大型机设计。我每天都会开车到Littleton，以便在我的指定产品上工作，这是一个名为“Argonaut”的新VAX大型机代码。这是从DEC的中频系统商业（MSB）部门的第三代产品，该公司先前设计并建造了VAX 8800系列。</p><p> The target market for the MSB group was medium-sized businesses: bigger than a mom-and-pop shop with only a few employees, but not a giant multinational company. Able to afford maybe hundreds of thousands for a computer, but not millions. This was a huge, growing market, and a host of minicomputer companies were playing in it, like  Data General,  Apollo, and  Prime Computer. But the big concern on everyone’s minds in the various hardware groups around DEC was almost always “Big Blue” — IBM.</p><p> MSB集团的目标市场是中型企业：大于一个只有少数员工的妈妈和流行商店，而不是巨大的跨国公司。能够为电脑提供数十万，但不是数百万人。这是一个巨大的，不断增长的市场，以及一系列小型计算机公司在它中播放，如数据通用，阿波罗和主要计算机。但对大都市各种硬件集团的每个人心中的大部分关切几乎总是“大蓝” -  IBM。</p><p>  I don’t remember having a lot of discussions about our competition, but there was a de-facto attitude among the engineers I hung out with anyway that the other minicomputer companies, such as Data General and Apollo, were just copycat wannabes — never able to match Digitals accomplishments, and not really a threat. IBM though held a different place in the threat hierarchy for us. I would say they commanded a lot more respect, being the number one computer company, and historically a major force in the development of computer technology.</p><p>  我不记得有很多关于我们的竞争的讨论，但是，无论如何，我挂出的工程师之间的态度是另一个小型计算机，例如数据通会和阿波罗，只是模仿崇拜者 - 从不能够匹配数字成就，而不是真正威胁。 IBM虽然在我们的威胁层次结构中持有不同的地方。我会说他们吩咐更多的尊重，成为一家计算机公司，历史上是计算机技术的发展中的重大武力。</p><p> That didn’t mean we thought they were better than us though. IBM’s image at DEC was one of a stuffy, slow, old-school company who’s time had already come and gone. (Ironically, that was very close to being true for DEC at this point, and in fact IBM would outlive us.) IBM was business-focused, and in a seemingly over-formal, boring way. Their engineers all wore ties, we were told (not entirely true, even in 1986), where at DEC, you would be made fun of if you showed up to work first day wearing a tie, even if you were a manager.</p><p> 这并不意味着我们认为它们比我们好。 IBM在Dec的形象是一个闷热，慢，老学校公司之一，他已经到了已经走了。 （讽刺意味着，这一点非常接近于TEC的真实，其实IBM会比我们更加努力。）IBM是专注于商业的，并以看似过于正式的，无聊的方式。他们的工程师所有穿着领带，我们被告知（并不完全是真的，即使在1986年），在十二月，如果你在第一天戴着领带时，你就会取笑，即使你是经理。</p><p> And so I worked in the company thinking IBM was both technically and culturally the enemy. But within the hardware groups that were building mainframe computers, IBM was also the target to be emulated, and hopefully surpassed. DEC was creating bigger and bigger systems, and the once rack-sized minicomputers of the PDP era had given way to larger, multi-cabinet setups, even within the midrange business unit that in theory was supposed to be making smaller, cheaper computers.</p><p> 所以我在公司工作，思考IBM在技术上和文化上都是敌人。但在构建大型机计算机的硬件组内，IBM也是要仿真的目标，并希望超越。 DEC创造了更大，更大的系统，即使在理论上的中间业务部门内，PDP时代的机架式小型计算机曾经有过多的多机柜设置，理论上应该制作更小，更便宜的计算机。</p><p> I worked for over a year on Argonaut, designing memory controller chips that handled our double-bit error correction and self test pattern generation, and working on the ram array design. We had completed the chip designs and simulations, and were to the point where we were getting close to building hardware.</p><p> 我在Argonaut工作了一年多，设计了处理我们的双位纠错和自检模式生成的内存控制器芯片，并在RAM阵列设计上工作。我们已经完成了芯片设计和模拟，并且是我们接近建筑硬件的地步。 </p><p> It was a crazy, incredible time, and I had the good fortune to work with and learn from some very talented people there, including a few who went on to be chip design superstars.  Jim Keller and  Pete Bannon to name a couple, but if I am going to name drop, I would also need to say that I was a very junior engineer, on the periphery of things. So I rarely interacted directly with the CPU design team and did not know those guys personally too well.</p><p>这是一个疯狂，令人难以置信的时光，我有很多财富与那里的一些非常有才华的人一起工作，包括一些人继续成为筹码设计超级巨星。 Jim Keller和Pete Bannon命名为一对夫妇，但如果我要去下降，我还需要说我是一个非常初级的工程师，在事情的周边。所以我很少直接与CPU设计团队互动，并不知道那些人的人太好了。</p><p> One day though I was sitting in a lab back in Shrewsbury doing going over our design specs with some techs there, and I got a call from the Littleton office. They said management had called a big meeting, and it was about the project and I needed to get back to the office right away. I got in my car and drove up immediately, but it was a short meeting and by the time I got up there, it was over. The takeaway from it was, Argonaut had been cancelled.</p><p> 有一天，虽然我坐在实验室里，在Shrewsbury做了我们在那里的一些科技的设计规范，我接到了Littleton办公室的电话。他们说管理人员叫大会，它是关于该项目，我需要立即回到办公室。我进入了我的车并立即开车，但这是一个很短的会议，当我在那里起床时，它结束了。来自它的外卖是，Argonaut已被取消。</p><p> I and safe to say a very large majority of people there were completely blind-sided by this, as cancellation had not been even a fleeting thought for us. We were laser-focused on completing our design, and getting it out into the battlefield against IBM. But technology problems had crept in, and the management and some of the senior technical staff there had been quietly trying to resolve a major obstacle that had cropped up with the I/O structure of the gate array chips we were using.</p><p> 我安全地说，这是一个非常盲目的人，这是完全盲目的，因为取消甚至对我们来说甚至没有呼气的想法。我们激光专注于完成我们的设计，并将其抵御IBM的战场。但是技术问题悄悄进入，管理层和一些高级技术人员悄然试图解决我们使用的门阵列芯片的I / O结构而裁剪的主要障碍。</p><p> For the technical, this was an issue of simultaneous switching, causing signal integrity problems. It was a big issue, the kind that would normally lead to a major project delay, and possibly some people being fired for making poor technical decisions (but honestly, at DEC we never fired anyone, we were really bad at it)</p><p> 对于技术来说，这是一个同时切换的问题，导致信号完整性问题。这是一个大问题，这种情况通常会导致一个主要的项目延误，并且可能有些人被解雇了解技术决策差（但是老年人，我们从未解雇任何人，我们真的很糟糕）</p><p> It could have been fixed, eventually though. Cancellation should have been off the table for a project like this, since building a next-generation business mainframe was at the time, a mission-critical thing for us.</p><p> 最终可能已经修复了。取消应该已经离开了这样的项目，因为建立了一个下一代商业大型机，这是我们的任务关键的事情。</p><p> The reason that cancellation of a year-or-more-long effort involving hundreds of engineers was feasible in the minds of DEC’s upper management was this: they had another competing product under development in the company to go to.</p><p> 取消涉及数百名工程师的年度或更多努力的原因在于12月的上层管理层的思想是可行的：他们在公司开发下有另一个竞争产品。</p><p> Fifteen miles to the south, in Marlborough, Massachusetts, sat a hulking fortress of a building that Digital called “MRO1”. MRO1 was a three-story concrete and glass structure, originally built in 1969 by RCA for use as factory space. It was later purchased by DEC for manufacturing use as well, but eventually converted to office space that was home to a major division of the company - High Performance Systems (HPS).</p><p> 到南部十五英里，在马萨诸塞州马拉堡，坐落于一座令人叫“Mro1”的建筑物的一个巨大的堡垒。 Mro1是一款三层混凝土和玻璃结构，最初由RCA建于1969年，用作出厂空间。它后来在DEC购买了制造业的情况下，但最终转换为办公空间，是公司的主要部门 - 高性能系统（HPS）。 </p><p> The sprawling factory floor that had years previously built  DECSystem-20s was now a sea of cubicles for the HPS engineering staff, the sheer scale of which was beyond anything I had ever seen, or have seen since. The Argonaut engineers from the much-smaller MSB building in Littleton would fit in one corner of this giant office complex.</p><p>庞大的工厂楼层以前建造了DECSYSTEM-20S现在是HPS Engineering员工的小隔间，其庞大的规模超出了我见过的任何东西，或者从此看过。来自Littleton的大多数MSB建筑的Agronaut工程师将适合这个巨型办公楼的一个角落。</p><p>  This was Digital’s “big computer” division, the group that was tasked with going after IBMs core business with very large, and very expensive mainframe computer designs. And if the MSB division in Littleton had IBM-envy, it was nothing compared with what was going on over in Marlborough. HPS was very much trying to be IBM, so much so that there had been a mini cultural shift from the DEC norm going on there, with managers wearing ties and a general higher level of formality of engineering processes.</p><p>  这是数字的“大电脑”师，该小组由IBMS核心业务以非常大的，非常昂贵的大型计算机设计。如果Littleton的MSB部门有IBM-envy，那么与马尔堡的发生相比，它没有什么比。 HPS非常试图成为IBM，这么多，因此来自于那里的DEC规范的迷你文化转变，经理佩戴领带和一般的工程流程形式。</p><p>  After the cancellation of Argonaut, there was a week-long, drunken party at the house of one of the engineers, “Nancy”, who had a place with a big back yard and an inground pool. The day they announced the news we were all in shock, and Nancy came to the rescue, inviting everyone over for an impromptu party — which was a badly needed distraction for all involved. I don’t remember much of it, I think Jim Keller threw me into the pool at one point, (which may have counted as the most significant interaction we ever had.)</p><p>  取消Argonaut后，在其中一名工程师的房子里有一个周长日，醉酒的派对，“南希”，他们有一个有一个大的后院和进入池的地方。他们宣布的那一天我们都震惊，南希来到救援，邀请每个人都过于一个即兴党 - 这是一项糟糕的令人沮丧。我不记得了很多，我认为Jim Keller在一点地把我扔进了池中，（这可能被视为我们曾经拥有的最重要的互动。）</p><p>  It was supposed to be a one day party, but as everyone soon found out, there was nothing to do at work. People would show up in the morning, and the management would give out stuff to read and research, like some things about MIPS architecture that we were looking into. But then everyone would just kind of leave, and we’d end up at Nancy’s house with suntan lotion, coolers and barbeque supplies, probably much to her dismay after two or three days.</p><p>  它应该是一个一天的派对，但随着每个人都很快发现，工作中没有什么可做的。人们会在早上出现，管理层会透露阅读和研究，就像我们正在研究的MIPS架构的一些事情。但随后每个人都只是休假，我们最终会在南希露天的房子里，冷却器和烧烤用品，可能在两三天后令她沮丧的可能很多。</p><p> The party eventually ended, but things went on over the summer in the same way: you would show up to work, see if anything was going on, management would say “stay tuned”, and you would go home. It amazed me even then that a company would allow this to happen. There were no layoffs, no reassignments to different groups, they just let everything float for pretty much the summer. It must have cost a fortune, and I highly doubt anything would go down like this ever again in today’s tech business world.</p><p> 派对最终结束了，但事情在夏天的方式上越来越多：你会展现出来的工作，看看有什么事情发生了，管理层会说“保持调整”，你会回家。它甚至对我来说令人惊讶的是，公司会允许这种情况发生。没有裁员，没有对不同的群体重新分配，他们只是让一切都漂浮在夏天。它必须花费一笔财富，我非常怀疑在今天的科技商业世界中再次如此。</p><p> My situation that summer was different though, owing to the fact that I was actually not part of the MSB division, but part of Electronic Storage Development. I was a centralized resource, who could be deployed on other projects easily. My managers were not about to let me have the summer off, since HPS was in the middle of their own giant mainframe project, code-named “Aquarius”. I was reassigned to this project, which was also in the late stages of development.</p><p> 由于我实际上不是MSB司的一部分，但夏天的情况是不同的，而且是电子存储开发的一部分。我是一个集中资源，可以轻松地部署在其他项目上。我的经理不是要让我夏天的休息，因为HPS是在他们自己的巨大的大型机项目中间，代号为“Aquarius”。我被重新分配给这个项目，这也在发展后期的发展阶段。</p><p> It was not an easy transition for me. Although organizationally, I worked for an outside group, I had been embedded in the MSB design team for over a year and had become quite loyal to our effort, and felt like part of the tribe. HPS to us was not a group we thought about much, but probably when we did, we lumped them into the “IBM” category of being a bloated, overly-formal, stuffy division.</p><p> 对我来说并不容易过渡。虽然组织地，我为一个外部集团工作，我已经嵌入了一年多的MSB设计团队，并已忠于我们的努力，并觉得是部落的一部分。 HPS给我们不是一个我们想到的小组，但可能在我们做过的时候，我们将他们陷入了“IBM”类别，成为一个臃肿，过于正式的闷闷不乐的部门。 </p><p> There was not much if any communication or technical exchange between the HPS and MSB design teams, even though we were working on very similar products. So I didn’t know what, if any, transferrable knowledge I gained from working on Argonaut could be applied to working on Aquarius.</p><p>如果HPS和MSB设计团队之间的任何沟通或技术交流，以及我们正在使用非常相似的产品，并不多。所以我不知道什么，如果我从事Argonaut工作的任何可转让知识，都可以应用于水瓶座的工作。</p><p> Once I got to Marlborough, I found that the HPS engineers were much more prone to looking over their shoulders at what might be going on over at MSB, and did in fact consider the ever-larger machines coming out of that division to be a competing threat to their work. They were all quite happy Argonaut was cancelled, and the product management there expanded the Aquarius product line to include a lower-end variant, called “Aridus” to fill in the gap left by the cancellation of our project. The whole Aquarius program had been envisioned as an “IBM Killer”, but its first (and spoiler, only) victim would be a product within the same company.</p><p> 一旦我到达Marlborough，我发现HPS工程师更容易探讨在MSB可能会发生的事情上，实际上认为，从那个司那时越来越大的机器考虑到竞争对他们的工作威胁。他们都是相当快乐的Argonaut被取消，而产品管理扩展了水瓶座产品线，包括一个名为“Aridus”的低端变体，以填补我们项目取消留下的差距。整个水瓶座计划被设想为“IBM杀手”，但它的第一个（和剧透）受害者将是同一公司内的产品。</p><p> And so it was very hard not to feel out of place, working in HPS — almost like I was an exchange student, or perhaps, captured prisoner. I remember listening to HPS people disparage the product group in MSB, and then ask me if the people there did the same kind of thing when talking about HPS. I was the rare guy who had been over enemy lines, and they would often ask about what things were like in MSB, as if we were talking about Russia or something. I kind of shrugged, because honestly we did not spend a lot of time in MSB thinking about them.</p><p> 因此，很难感觉不合适，在HPS工作 - 几乎就像我是一名交换学生，或者也许是俘虏囚犯。我记得听听HPS人员在MSB中贬低产品组，然后在谈论HPS时询问我是否在那里做了同样的事情。我是一位曾经过于敌人线的罕见人，他们经常询问MSB中的事情，就像我们在谈论俄罗斯或某事一样。我有点耸了耸肩，因为老实说，我们没有花很多时间在MSB思考他们。</p><p> Someone should have though, obviously. Today I find it ridiculous that a major corporation would allow huge groups to silo to this degree, to fail to communicate, cooperate, and share, and to allow them to build overlapping and competing products. To allow this kind of animosity to build between employees of the same company. We’re talking about thousands of engineers involved here, between the two divisions. Seems like something that could have only happened in the crazy 1980’s, but I am betting if enough people read this far, we will see comments to the contrary.</p><p> 显然有人应该拥有。今天，我发现一个主要公司将允许庞大的群体到这一学位，未能沟通，合作和分享，并允许他们建立重叠和竞争产品的荒谬荒谬。允许这种敌意在同一公司的员工之间建立。我们在两个部门之间讨论了这里参与其中的成千上万的工程师。似乎只是在疯狂的1980年代发生的东西，但我打赌如果足够的人读到这一点，我们将看到恰恰相反。</p><p> This siloed competition phenomenon in fact happens a lot, and I have seen lesser versions of this play out at other, smaller companies I’ve worked for. Sometimes it is just a matter of two groups colliding with each other and trying to do the same thing, or even two individuals. The common goal of beating the external competition gives way to an internal fight for control of something, fueled by lack of communication and sometimes, lack of trust.</p><p> 这种敌人的竞争现象实际上发生了很多，而且我已经看到了这场比赛的那些鲜明的版本，我曾经工作过。有时，这只是两个群体互相碰撞，并试图做同样的事情，甚至两个人。击败外部竞争的共同目标让位于控制某些东西的内部斗争，通过缺乏沟通，有时缺乏信任。</p><p> Maybe its too simplistic a take, but for me it all of it owes to a failure of management, somewhere in the end. Easy to say I know, and not always easily or effectively addressed, but in essence avoidable. DEC’s version of this failure was just perhaps a bigger example of competitive siloing that is allowed to manifest at many companies, very often to negative effect.</p><p> 也许是它太简单的，但对我来说，所有这一切都归功于管理层，到底某个地方。很容易说我知道，并不总是容易或有效地解决，而是实质上可以避免。 DEC的这种失败版本可能只是一个更大的竞争孤岛典型的例子，允许在许多公司中表现出来，经常是负面影响。</p><p> The Aquarius project for its part turned out to be a billion dollar disaster, and that doesn’t even count however much money was spent on our cancelled Argonaut project. Released in 1989 as the  VAX 9000, only a few dozen were sold, despite the billion dollar development cost.</p><p> 水瓶座项目的部分令人灾难令人灾难，甚至没有计数，但在我们取消的Argonaut项目上花了很多钱。 1989年发布为vax 9000，只有几十几个被销售，尽管很少十亿美元的发展成本。 </p><p>  Much of this failure owes to technical missteps, to be clear. Aquarius was so-named because it was a water cooled system, a necessity due to the enormous power demands of the bipolar transistor, emitter-coupled logic (ECL) technology used in the system. This technology was in favor at the time due to its speed, but required exotic cooling and interconnect technology that required an army of mechanical and thermal engineers to design.</p><p>这种衰退的大部分都归功于技术误解。水瓶座是如此命名，因为它是水冷系统，这是由于双极晶体管，系统中使用的发射极耦合逻辑（ECL）技术的巨大电力需求导致的必然性。这项技术在速度下有利于其速度，但需要异国情调的冷却和互连技术，需要一支机械和热工程师设计。</p><p> It all would soon be eclipsed by superior CMOS chip technology, which offered good performance with much less power required. This in turn allowed chips to be scaled up in size, reducing chip counts and thus interconnect delays between chips, boosting the overall performance of the entire system.</p><p> 这一切都将很快被卓越的CMOS芯片技术黯然失色，这提供了良好的性能，需要更少的电力。这反过来允许芯片尺寸缩放，减少芯片计数，从而互连芯片之间的延迟，提高整个系统的整体性能。</p><p> And to be fair - our cancelled Argonaut project also utilized ECL chip technology, so would have had similar drawbacks. In the end, the winner (within DEC anyway) in this competitive CPU design contest was neither the Littleton MSB group or the Marlborough HPS group, but what was coming out of our chip foundry in Hudson, Massachusetts. Fast VLSI CMOS processors, starting with the  microVAX chip sets but eventually leading to the high-performance Alpha chip, would soon dominate the company, eliminating CPU design groups in both MSB and HPS.</p><p> 并且是公平的 - 我们取消的Argonaut项目也使用了ECL芯片技术，因此会有类似的缺点。最终，在这个竞争激烈的CPU设计比赛中获胜者（无论如何）都不是Littleton MSB集团还是Marlborough HPS集团，但是在马萨诸塞州哈德森的芯片铸造中出现了什么。 Fast VLSI CMOS处理器从Microvax Chip集开始，但最终导致高性能alpha芯片，将很快主导公司，消除了MSB和HPS中的CPU设计组。</p><p> Maybe if we had moved these mainframe projects to CMOS earlier, there would have been a way for both these projects to succeed in the marketplace, who knows. And the larger strategic issue of DEC being slow to follow the “smaller, cheaper, better” route that the industry pivoted to once CMOS technology matured is also a huge factor in our companies decline — and beyond the scope of this story.</p><p> 也许如果我们早些时候向CMOS移动了这些大型机项目，那么这些项目都会在知道的市场中取得成功。和较大的战略问题是慢慢遵循“较小，更便宜”的速度，即行业枢转的行业枢转到CMOS技术成熟也是我们公司衰落的巨大因素 - 超出了这个故事的范围。</p><p> It could be that failure was just in the cards for us. When I think back on this time though, I keep returning to the idea that we would have been in a much better position somehow if these company divisions had worked together, rather than competed as rivals. (In writing this, the word “divisions” in the first place seems very tell-tale.)</p><p> 这可能是失败的只是我们的卡片。当我回想出这个时间时，我一直归功于我们在某种程度上在某种程度上在某种程度上处于更好的位置，如果这些公司部门一起工作，而不是竞争对手。 （在写这篇文章中，第一个地方“划分”这个词似乎非常讲述。）</p><p> Certainly the R&amp;D costs would have been lower, and maybe a cooperating set of R&amp;D groups could have come up with a better technical solution. Or if MSB had targeted a lower-end market segment with less overlap, perhaps their project would not have been cancelled, and at least on of the two projects would have succeeded in making a profit. Whatever the case, the whole combined thing had to have gone down as one of the most expensive blunders in computer development history.</p><p> 当然，R＆amp; D成本将较低，也许是一个合作的R＆amp; D组可能会提出更好的技术解决方案。或者如果MSB瞄准了较少重叠的低端市场段，也许他们的项目不会被取消，并且至少两个项目将成功地赚取利润。无论如何，整个组合的东西都必须被归结为计算机开发历史上最昂贵的吹风机之一。</p><p> I remember in 1993, after it had become clear that Aquarius was a flop, attending an R&amp;D staff meeting in an auditorium in Digital’s famous “Mill” headquarters in Maynard, Massachusetts, where I was then working in the Alpha Workstations group. DEC’s stock price had dropped, we were in the midst of a series of layoffs, and a discontented crowd had gathered to hear Jack Smith, Chief Operating Officer of the company, speak.</p><p> 我记得1993年，清楚地清楚地说，水瓶座是一个翻转，参加了一个R＆amp; Dight在Mayachusetts的Digital的“ill”总部的一名礼堂的工作人员会议，然后我在alpha工作站集团工作。 12月的股票价格下降，我们在一系列裁员中，一位不满的人群聚集在一起，听到公司首席运营官的杰克史密斯，发言。 </p><p> Jack was not well liked by a lot of the engineering staff, and had in the past done things such as send out a memo complaining about how the parking lot at the Mill was only half full at 9AM, where in the old days it was always full. When he was not accusing people of shorting their work hours, he was green-lighting bad product decisions, like funding two largely overlapping projects that used soon-to-be-obsolete technology. I don’t remember the content of the meeting, probably a pep talk of some sort, but I do remember the Q&amp;A that followed.</p><p>杰克不受很多工程人员的喜好，并且在过去做了一些备忘录，如备忘录，抱怨厂房的停车场是如何在上午9点才有一半，在过去的那天，它总是如此满的。当他没有指责人们缩短工作时间时，他是绿色照明的不良产品决策，如资金使用很快过时的技术的主要重叠的项目。我不记得会议的内容，可能是一个谈论某种东西，但我记得Q＆amp;一个随后的Q＆amp。</p><p> A bold engineer stood up and said bluntly that the company had spent one billion dollars developing a computer that no one wanted, and that if we had instead invested in literally anything else, such as for instance McDonald’s franchises, we would have made more money. Jack (who was obviously bad at reading a room, or otherwise he would not have scheduled a Q&amp;A in the first place) stood there numbly and only said:</p><p> 一位大胆的工程师站起来，直言不讳地说，公司已经花了十亿美元开发一个没有人想要的电脑，如果我们相反，如果我们在字面上投入了其他任何东西，例如麦当劳的特许经营，我们就会赚更多的钱。杰克（谁在阅读房间很糟糕，否则他不会安排一个Q＆amp;首先是一个Q＆amp）与之大吃一谈，只有说：</p><p>    Many other armchair analysists and MBA students have debated the causes of Digital’s downfall, and there is probably no new ground left to cover here. And I don’t know to what degree the unchecked redundancy and inter-division competition played in the failures of these mainframe projects, or of Digital in general. But do I know it certainly didn’t help. For me, the memories of these projects remain as an cautionary reminder of what can happen when people in an organization fail to cooperate with each other.</p><p>    许多其他扶手椅分析主义者和MBA学生已经讨论了数字垮台的原因，并且可能没有剩下新的地面来覆盖。我不知道在这些大型机项目的失败或数字一般的失败中扮演的未经检查的冗余和跨境比赛。但我知道它肯定没有帮助。对我而言，这些项目的回忆仍然是警示提醒，当组织中的人员无法互相合作时会发生什么。</p><p> Shortly after the events of this story, Digital would close its iconic Maynard headquarters, along with many other offices in order to control costs. And i</p><p> 在这个故事的事件之后不久，数字将关闭其标志性的Maynard总部，以及许多其他办事处以控制成本。和我</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://madned.substack.com/p/the-enemy-within">https://madned.substack.com/p/the-enemy-within</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/竞争/">#竞争</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
