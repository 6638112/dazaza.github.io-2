(I admit that the below version has been pieced together from a few incomplete online sources, primarily  this one, which was reprinted by Peter Morwood, and which seems to have been a slightly different edit from the  Books and Bookmen version.) It meanders a little, and it’s a little pompous in places (even as it tries to be casual about it) and parts of it have not aged particularly well (delicate shade of pink, indeed), but in the end, most of it is still pretty good advice.</p><p> 幸运的是，我最近偶然发现了弗莱明（Fleming）的一篇文章，标题为“如何编写惊悚片”，该文章出现在1963年5月的《书籍与书友》（Books and Bookmen）中，距作者去世仅一年多。 （我承认下面的版本是由一些不完整的在线资源拼凑而成的，主要是彼得·莫伍德（Peter Morwood）重印的该版本，似乎与《图书与Bookmen》版本略有不同。）很少，并且在某些地方有点浮夸（即使它试图让它变得随意），并且它的某些部分还没有特别好地老化（确实是粉红色的淡淡阴影），但是最后，大多数还是不错的建议。</p><p>  The craft of writing sophisticated thrillers is almost dead. Writers seem to be ashamed of inventing heroes who are white, villains who are black, and heroines who are a delicate shade of pink.</p><p>  编写复杂的惊悚小说的技巧几乎已经死了。作家似乎为发明白色英雄，黑色恶棍和精致的粉红色女英雄而感到羞耻。</p><p>   I am not an angry young, or even middle-aged, man. I am not “involved.” My books are not “engaged.” I have no message for suffering humanity and, though I was bullied at school and lost my virginity like so many of us used to do in the old days, I have never been tempted to foist these and other harrowing personal experiences on the public. My opuscula do not aim at changing people or making them go out and do something. They are written for warm-blooded heterosexuals in railway trains, airplanes and beds.</p><p>   我不是一个生气的年轻人，甚至不是中年人。我没有“参与”。我的书没有“订婚”。我没有遭受人类苦难的消息，尽管我像以前的许多人一样在学校被欺负，失去了童贞，但我从未尝试过将这些以及其他令人痛苦的个人经历强加给公众。我的职责不是要改变人或使他们外出做某事。它们是为火车，飞机和床铺上的温血异性恋者而写的。</p><p> I have a charming relative who is an angry young littérateur of renown. He is maddened by the fact that more people read my books than his. Not long ago we had semi-friendly words on the subject and I tried to cool his boiling ego by saying that his artistic purpose was far, far higher than mine. He was engaged in “The Shakespeare Stakes.” The target of his books was the head and, to some extent at least, the heart. The target of my books, I said, lay somewhere between the solar plexus and, well, the upper thigh. These self-deprecatory remarks did nothing to mollify him and finally, with some impatience and perhaps with something of an ironical glint in my eye, I asked him how he described himself on his passport. “I bet you call yourself an Author,” I said. He agreed, with a shade of reluctance, perhaps because he scented sarcasm on the way. “Just so,” I said. “Well, I describe myself as a Writer. There are authors and artists, and then again there are writers and painters.”</p><p> 我有一个迷人的亲戚，是一位生气勃勃的年轻文学家。他读过我的书的人比他多的事实令他感到震惊。不久前，我们在这个话题上说了几句半友好的话，我试图通过说他的艺术目的远比我高得多来冷却他的自我。他从事《莎士比亚名胜》。他的书的目标是头部，至少在一定程度上是心脏。我说过，我书的目标位于太阳神经丛和大腿上部之间的某个地方。这些自嘲的言论丝毫没有减轻他的痛苦，最后，我有些不耐烦，也许带着讽刺的眼神，问他如何在护照上描述自己。我说：“我敢打赌，你称自己是作者。”他有些勉强地答应了，也许是因为他在途中闻到了讽刺。 “就是这样，”我说。 “嗯，我形容自己是作家。有作家和画家，再有作家和画家。”</p><p> This rather spiteful jibe, which forced him, most unwillingly, into the ranks of the Establishment, whilst stealing for myself the halo of a simple craftsman of the people, made the angry young man angrier than ever and I don’t now see him as often as I used to. But the point I wish to make is that if you decide to become a professional writer, you must, broadly speaking, decide whether you wish to write for fame, for pleasure or for money. I write, unashamedly, for pleasure and money.</p><p> 这种相当卑鄙的态度使他最不情愿地被迫进入机构的行列，同时为自己偷走了一个简单的工匠的光环，这使愤怒的年轻人比以往任何时候都更加愤怒，我现在不认为他是像我以前那样但是我想说的是，如果您决定成为一名专业作家，那么从广义上讲，您必须决定自己是为名利，娱乐还是金钱而写作。我毫不羞愧地为快乐和金钱而写作。</p><p>    I also feel that, while thrillers may not be Literature with a capital L, it is possible to write what I can best describe as “Thrillers designed to be read as literature,” the practitioners of which have included such as Edgar Allan Poe, Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, Eric Ambler and Graham Greene. I see nothing shameful in aiming as high as these.</p><p>    我也觉得，尽管惊悚小说可能不是大写L的文学作品，但我可以写出我最能形容为“被设计为文学作品的惊悚小说”，其中包括艾德加·艾伦·坡，达西耶尔等在内的从业者。 Hammett，Raymond Chandler，Eric Ambler和Graham Greene。瞄准如此高的目标，我没有感到可耻。</p><p> All right then, so we have decided to write for money and to aim at certain standards in our writing. These standards will include an unmannered prose style, unexceptional grammar and a certain integrity in our narrative.</p><p>好的，所以我们决定以金钱为目的，并在写作中以某些标准为目标。这些标准将包括无礼的散文风格，无例外的语法以及我们叙述中的一定完整性。</p><p> But these qualities will not make a best seller. There is only one recipe for a best seller and it is a very simple one. You have to get the reader to turn over the page.</p><p> 但是这些品质不会成为畅销书。畅销书只有一种配方，这是非常简单的配方。您必须让读者翻页。</p><p>  If you look back on the best sellers you have read, you will find that they all have this quality. You simply  have to turn over the page.</p><p>  如果您回顾阅读过的最畅销书，您会发现它们都具有这种品质。您只需翻页即可。</p><p> Nothing must be allowed to interfere with this essential dynamic of the thriller. This is why I said that your prose must be simple and unmannered. You cannot linger too long over descriptive passages.</p><p> 绝不允许任何东西干扰惊悚片的这种基本动力。这就是为什么我说您的散文必须简单无礼。对于描述性段落，您不能流连忘返。</p><p> There must be no complications in names, relationships, journeys or geographical settings to confuse or irritate the reader. He must never ask himself “Where am I? Who is this person? What the hell are they all doing?” Above all there must never be those maddening recaps where the hero maunders about his unhappy fate, goes over in his mind a list of suspects, or reflects what he might have done or what he proposes to do next. By all means, set the scene or enumerate the heroine’s measurements as lovingly as you wish, but in doing so, each word must tell, and interest or titillate the reader before the action hurries on.</p><p> 名称，人际关系，旅程或地理环境必须没有任何复杂性，以免使读者感到困惑或烦恼。他绝对不能问自己“我在哪里？这个人是谁？他们到底在做什么？”最重要的是，绝对不能有那些令人发狂的回顾，在这些回顾中，英雄会为自己的不幸命运而烦恼，在脑海中翻阅一系列犯罪嫌疑人，或者反映出他可能做了什么或下一步打算做什么。一定要按照自己的喜好设置场景或枚举女主人公的身高，但这样做时，每个单词都必须说明，并在采取行动之前引起读者的兴趣或陶醉。</p><p>  I confess that I often sin grievously in this respect. I am excited by the poetry of things and places, and the pace of my stories sometimes suffers while I take the reader by the throat and stuff him with great gobbets of what I consider  should interest him, at the same time shaking him and shouting “Like this, damn you!” about something that has caught my particular fancy. But this is a sad lapse, and I must confess that in one of my books,  Goldfinger, three whole chapters were devoted to a single game of golf.</p><p>  我承认在这方面我经常犯下严重罪行。我对事物和地点的诗歌感到兴奋，有时我的故事步伐会受到影响，而我却紧紧抓住读者的喉咙，塞满了我认为应该引起他兴趣的大杯啤酒，同时摇晃他并大喊“像这样，该死的你！”关于引起我特别喜欢的事情。但这是一个可悲的失误，我必须承认，在我的一本著作《金手指》中，整整三章专门讨论了一场高尔夫比赛。</p><p> Well, having achieved a workmanlike style and the all-essential pace of narrative, what are we to put in the book—what are the ingredients of a thriller?</p><p> 好吧，在实现了工人式的风格和叙事的所有基本步伐之后，我们在书中要写些什么—惊悚片的成分是什么？</p><p> Briefly, the ingredients are anything that will thrill any of the human senses—absolutely anything.</p><p>简而言之，成分是任何会令人类感动的东西-绝对是任何东西。</p><p> In this department, my contribution to the art of thriller-writing has been to attempt the total stimulation of the reader all the way through, even to his taste buds. For instance, I have never understood why people in books have to eat such sketchy and indifferent meals. English heroes seem to live on cups of tea and glasses of beer, and when they do get a square meal we never hear what it consists of. Personally, I am not a gourmet and I abhor food-and-winemanship. My favorite food is scrambled eggs. In the original typescript of  Live and Let Die, James Bond consumed scrambled eggs so often that a perceptive proof-reader suggested that this rigid pattern of life must be becoming a security risk for Bond. If he was being followed, his tail would only have to go into restaurants and say “Was there a man here eating scrambled eggs?” to know whether he was on the right track or not. So I had to go through the book changing the menus.</p><p> 在这个部门，我对惊悚写作艺术的贡献一直是试图一路激发读者的兴趣，甚至激发他的味蕾。例如，我从未理解为什么书中的人必须吃这样粗略而冷漠的饭菜。英国英雄似乎生活在喝茶和啤酒的杯子上，当他们吃到一顿正餐时，我们永远不会听到它的成分。就我个人而言，我不是美食家，我讨厌食物和酒水。我最喜欢的食物是炒鸡蛋。在《生与死》的原始打字稿中，詹姆斯·邦德（James Bond）经常食用炒鸡蛋，以至于有感性的校对者建议，这种僵化的生活模式必将成为邦德的安全隐患。如果被跟踪，他的尾巴只需要去餐馆里说：“这里有人吃炒鸡蛋吗？”知道他是否在正确的轨道上。因此，我必须仔细阅读本书以更改菜单。</p><p>   It must surely be more stimulating to the reader’s senses if, instead of writing “He made a hurried meal off the  Plat du Jour—excellent cottage pie and vegetables, followed by home-made trifle” (I think this is a fair English menu without burlesque) you write “Being instinctively mistrustful of all  Plats du Jour, he ordered four fried eggs cooked on both sides, hot buttered toast and a large cup of black coffee.” No difference in price here, but the following points should be noted: firstly, we all prefer breakfast foods to the sort of food one usually gets at luncheon and dinner; secondly, this is an independent character who knows what he wants and gets it; thirdly, four fried eggs has the sound of a real man’s meal and, in our imagination, a large cup of black coffee sits well on our taste buds after the rich, buttery sound of the fried eggs and the hot buttered toast.</p><p>   如果不是写“他用美味的馅饼和蔬菜，再加上自制的琐碎食物，然后在Jour Plat du Jour上匆匆做饭”，那肯定是对读者的感觉有更大的刺激（我认为这是一个不错的英语菜单，没有滑稽的人物）你写道：“由于本能地不信任所有的Plas du Jour，他点了两面煮的四个煎鸡蛋，热黄油吐司和一大杯黑咖啡。”这里的价格没有差别，但应注意以下几点：首先，我们都喜欢早餐食品，而不是通常在午餐和晚餐时食用的食品。其次，这是一个独立的角色，知道自己想要什么并得到了它。第三，四个煎鸡蛋听起来像是真正的男人用餐，在我们的想象中，在煎鸡蛋和黄油烤面包发出浓郁的黄油味之后，一大杯黑咖啡正好放在我们的味蕾上。</p><p> What I aim at is a certain disciplined exoticism. I have not re-read any of my books to see if this stands up to close examination, but I think you will find that the sun is always shining in my books—a state of affairs which minutely lifts the spirit of the English reader—that most of the settings of my books are in themselves interesting and pleasurable, taking the reader to exciting places around the world, and that, in general, a strong hedonistic streak is always there to offset the grimmer side of Bond’s adventures. This, so to speak, “pleasures” the reader . . .</p><p> 我的目标是某种有纪律的异国情调。我还没有重新阅读我的书来看看是否可以通过严密的检查，但是我认为您会发现我的书中总是阳光普照，这种状况在某种程度上提升了英语阅读者的精神，我的书中的大多数设置本身都是有趣且令人愉悦的，将读者带到了世界各地令人兴奋的地方，并且总的来说，始终存在强烈的享乐主义色彩，以抵消邦德冒险的阴暗面。可以这么说，这“使读者满意”。 。 。</p><p> At this stage let me pause for a moment and assure you that, while all this sounds devilish crafty, it has only been by endeavoring to analyze the success of my books for the purpose of this essay that I have come to these conclusions. In fact, I write about what pleases and stimulates me.</p><p> 在这个阶段，让我暂停片刻，向您保证，尽管所有这些听起来都是诡计多端，但仅出于本文目的，我一直在努力分析我的书籍的成功之处，从而得出了这些结论。实际上，我写的是什么使我感到高兴和振奋。</p><p>  My plots are fantastic, while being often based upon truth. They go wildly beyond the probable but not, I think, beyond the possible. . . . Even so, they would stick in the gullet of the reader and make him throw the book angrily aside—for a reader particularly hates feeling he is being hoaxed—but for two further technical devices, if you like to call them that. First of all, the aforesaid speed of the narrative, which hustles the reader quickly beyond each danger point of mockery and, secondly, the constant use of familiar household names and objects which reassure him that he and the writer have still got their feet on the ground. This is where the real names of things come in useful. A Ronson lighter, a 4.5 litre Bentley with an Amherst-Villiers supercharger (please note the solid exactitude), the Ritz Hotel in London, the 21 Club in New York, the exact names of flora and fauna, even James Bond’s Sea Island cotton shirts with short sleeves. All these details are  points de repère to comfort and reassure the reader on his journey into fantastic adventure.</p><p>  我的情节太棒了，而通常都是基于事实。他们疯狂地超越了可能性，但我认为没有超越可能。 。 。 。即使这样，它们仍会卡在读者的食槽中，使他愤怒地将书扔到一边-因为读者特别讨厌觉得自己被骗了-但是对于另外两个技术设备，如果您喜欢这样称呼他们。首先，上述叙述的速度使读者迅速逃避嘲笑的每个危险点；其次，不断使用熟悉的家喻户晓的名字和物件，使他确信自己和作家仍能站稳脚跟。地面。这是事物的真实名称有用的地方。 Ronson打火机，4.5升Bentley跑车和Amherst-Villiers增压器（请注意坚固性），伦敦的Ritz Hotel，纽约的21 Club，动植物的确切名称，甚至包括James Bond的Sea Island棉质衬衫短袖。所有这些细节都是要舒适和使读者放心进入奇妙冒险旅程的要点。</p><p>   Well, I seem to be getting on very well with picking my books to pieces, so we might as well pick still deeper.</p><p>   好吧，我似乎在整理书本方面做得很好，所以我们不妨进一步选书。</p><p> People often ask me, “How do you manage to think of that? What an extraordinary (or sometimes extraordinarily dirty) mind you must have.”</p><p>人们经常问我：“您如何想到这一点？您必须有什么特别的（有时甚至是非常肮脏的）想法。”</p><p>  I certainly have got vivid powers of imagination, but I don’t think there is anything very odd about that. We are all fed fairy stories and adventure stories and ghost stories for the first 20 years of our lives, and the only difference between me and perhaps you is that my imagination earns me money. But, to revert to my first book,  Casino Royale, there are strong incidents in the book which are all based on fact. I extracted them from my wartime memories of the Naval Intelligence Division of the Admiralty, dolled them up, attached a hero, a villain and a heroine, and there was the book.</p><p>  我当然具有想象力的生动力量，但是我认为这没有什么奇怪的。在我们生命的前20年，我们都饱受童话，冒险故事和幽灵故事的困扰，而我与您之间的唯一区别就是我的想象力为我赚了钱。但是，回到我的第一本书，《皇家赌场》，本书中有很多事件都是基于事实的。我从战时对海军部海军情报部的回忆中提取了它们，将它们装扮成玩具，并附加了一个英雄，一个小人和一个女英雄，然后便有了这本书。</p><p> The first was the attempt on Bond’s life outside the Hotel Splendide. SMERSH had given two Bulgarian assassins box camera cases to hang over their shoulders. One was of red leather and the other one blue. SMERSH told the Bulgarians that the red one contained a bomb and the blue one a powerful smoke screen, under cover of which they could escape.</p><p> 首先是尝试在邦德酒店外的生活中尝试邦德的生活。 SMERSH已经给了两个保加利亚刺客盒装相机镜箱悬在他们的肩膀上。一种是红色皮革，另一种是蓝色。 SMERSH告诉保加利亚人，红色的炸弹装有炸弹，蓝色的炸弹装有强大的烟幕，在掩护下他们可以逃脱。</p><p> One was to throw the red bomb and the other was then to press the button on the blue case. But the Bulgars mistrusted the plan and decided to press the button on the blue case and envelop themselves in the smoke screen before throwing the bomb. In fact, the blue case also contained a bomb powerful enough to blow both the Bulgars to fragments and remove all evidence which might point to SMERSH.</p><p> 一种是投掷红色炸弹，另一种是按下蓝色弹壳上的按钮。但是保加利亚人对此计划不信任，决定在投下炸弹之前，按下蓝色盒子上的按钮，将自己包裹在烟幕中。实际上，蓝色的箱子还装有炸弹，炸弹的威力足以将两个保加利亚人炸成碎片，并清除所有可能指向SMERSH的证据。</p><p>  Farfetched, you might say. In fact, this was the method used in the Russian attempt on Von Papen’s life in Ankara in the middle of the war. On that occasion the assassins were also Bulgarians and they were blown to nothing while Von Papen and his wife, walking from their house to the embassy; were only bruised by the blast.</p><p>  您可能会说牵强。实际上，这是俄国在战争中试图企图冯·帕彭（Von Papen）在安卡拉生活的方法。那个时候刺客也是保加利亚人，当冯·帕彭和他的妻子从他们的房子走到使馆时，他们被炸死了。只因爆炸而受伤。</p><p>  As to the gambling scene, this grew in my mind from the following incident. I and my chief, the Director of Naval Intelligence—Admiral Godfrey—in plain clothes, were flying to Washington in 1941 for secret talks with the American Office of Naval Intelligence, before America came into the war. Our seaplane touched down at Lisbon for an overnight stop, and our Intelligence people told us how Lisbon was crawling with German secret agents. The chief of these and his two assistants gambled every night in the casino at the neighboring Estoril. I suggested to the DNI that he and I should have a look at these people. We went, and there were the three men, playing at the high  chemin de fer table. Then the feverish idea came to me that I would sit down and gamble against these men and defeat them, thereby reducing the funds of the German Secret Service.</p><p>  至于赌博现场，在接下来的事件中，这在我脑海中浮现。我和我的酋长，海军情报局局长戈弗雷海军上将穿便服，于1941年美国参战前飞往华盛顿，与美国海军情报局进行秘密会谈。我们的水上飞机降落在里斯本，经过一整夜，情报人员告诉我们里斯本如何与德国特工一起爬行。这些酋长和他的两名助手每天晚上在附近的埃斯托里尔（Estoril）的赌场赌博。我向DNI建议他和我看看这些人。我们走了，有三个人，在高化学桌旁玩耍。后来我想到了一个狂热的想法，我会坐下来与这些人赌博，打败他们，从而减少德国特勤局的资金。</p><p> It was a foolhardy plan which would have needed a golden streak of luck. I had £50 in travel money. The chief German agent had run a bank three times. I bancoed it and lost. I suivied and lost again, and suivied a third time and was cleaned out, a humiliating experience which added to the sinews of war of the German Secret Service and reduced me sharply in my chief’s estimation.</p><p> 这是一个艰苦的计划，需要有一点运气。我有50英镑的旅行钱。这名德国首席特工曾三度经营一家银行。我取缔了它，然后迷路了。我再次屈服并迷失了自己，第三次屈服并被洗劫一空，这种丢人的经历加重了德国特勤局的战争筋骨，使我的首领大为失望。</p><p>  It was this true incident which is the kernel of Bond’s great gamble against Le Chiffre.</p><p>正是这起真正的事件，是邦德针对勒·奇夫勒的伟大赌博的核心。</p><p> Finally, the torture scene. What I described in Casino Royale was a greatly watered-down version of a French-Moroccan torture known as  passer á la mandoline, which was practiced on several of our agents during the war.</p><p> 最后是酷刑现场。我在《皇家赌场》中描述的是法摩摩洛哥酷刑的一种被彻底淡化的版本，称为“ man la la mandoline过客”，战争期间我们的一些特工都在实践这种做法。</p><p> So you see the line between fact and fantasy is a very narrow one. I think I could trace most of the central incidents in my books to some real happenings.</p><p> 因此，您会看到事实与幻想之间的界限非常狭窄。我认为我可以将我书中的大多数中心事件追溯到一些真实的事件。</p><p> We thus come to the final and supreme hurdle in the writing of a thriller. You must know thrilling things before you can write about them. Imagination alone isn’t enough, but stories you hear from friends or read in the papers can be built up by a fertile imagination and a certain amount of research and documentation into incidents that will also ring true in fiction.</p><p> 因此，我们在编写惊悚片时遇到了最终和最高的障碍。您必须先了解激动人心的事情，然后才能写下它们。仅仅凭空想象是不够的，但是您可以从丰富的想象力以及对事件的一定程度的研究和记录中建立起您从朋友那里听到的故事或在报纸上阅读的故事，这些故事在小说中也是如此。</p><p>  Having assimilated all this encouraging advice, your heart will nevertheless quail at the physical effort involved in writing even a thriller. I warmly sympathize with you. I too, am lazy. My heart sinks when I contemplate the two or three hundred virgin sheets of foolscap I have to besmirch with more or less well chosen words in order to produce a 60,000 word book.</p><p>  吸收了所有这些令人鼓舞的建议后，即使编写惊悚片，您的内心也会为所付出的体力而感到振奋。我对你表示同情。我也是，很懒。当我想到两三百张原始的傻瓜纸时，我的心沉浸了，我不得不用或多或少的精挑细选的单词来糊涂，以产生一本60,000册的单词本。</p><p>  In my case, one of the first essentials is to create a vacuum in my life which can only be satisfactorily filled by some form of creative work, whether it be writing, painting, sculpting, composing or just building a boat. I am fortunate in this respect. I built a small house on the north shore of Jamaica in 1946 and arranged my life so I could spend at least two months of the winter there. For the first six years I had plenty to do during these months exploring Jamaica, coping with staff and getting to know the locals, and minutely examining the underwater terrain within my reef. But by the sixth year I had exhausted all these possibilities, and I was about to get married – a prospect which filled me with terror and mental fidget. To give my idle hands something to do, and as an antibody to my qualms about the marriage state after 43 years as a bachelor, I decided one day to damned well sit down and write a book. The therapy was successful. And while I still do a certain amount of writing in the midst of my London Life, it is on my annual visits to Jamaica that all my books have been written. But, failing a hideaway such as I possess, I can recommend hotel bedrooms as far removed from your usual “life” as possible. Your anonymity in these drab surroundings and your lack of friends and distractions in the strange locale will create a vacuum which should force you into a writing mood and, if your pocket is shallow, into a mood which will also make you write fast and with application.</p><p>  以我为例，首先要创造的真空是我生活中的真空，这种真空只能通过某种形式的创意作品来令人满意地填补，无论是写作，绘画，雕刻，构图还是仅仅建造一条船。在这方面，我很幸运。 1946年，我在牙买加北岸建造了一座小房子，安排了自己的生活，以便在那里度过至少两个月的冬天。在最初的六年中，在这几个月中，我有很多工作要做，包括探索牙买加，与工作人员打交道并结识当地人，并仔细检查珊瑚礁内的水下地形。但是到了第六年，我已经用尽了所有这些可能性，并且我即将结婚-这个前景使我充满了恐怖和精神上的烦恼。为了给闲着的事情做些事情，并作为对单身43年后的婚姻状况的一种抗拒，我决定有一天该死的好好坐下来写一本书。治疗成功。虽然我在伦敦生活中仍在做一些写作，但我每年对牙买加的访问都写了我所有的书。但是，如果没有像我这样的藏身之处，我可以建议您将酒店的卧室与您平时的“生活”尽量远离。您在这些单调乏味的环境中的匿名性，以及在陌生区域中缺乏朋友和分心的情况，将造成真空，这将迫使您进入写作状态，如果口袋太浅，则将进入一种情绪状态，这也将使您在使用应用程序时快速书写。</p><p> So far as the physical act of writing is concerned, the method I have devised is this. I do it all on the typewriter, using six fingers. The act of typing is far less exhausting than the act of writing, and you end up with a more or less clean manuscript. The next essential is to keep strictly to a routine—and I mean strictly. I write for about three hours in the morning—from about 9:30 till 12:30—and I do another hour’s work between 6 and 7 in the evening. At the end of this I reward myself by numbering the pages and putting them away in a spring-back folder. The whole of this four hours of daily work is devoted to writing narrative.</p><p> 就写作的身体行为而言，我设计的方法就是这样。我用六根手指在打字机上完成所有操作。打字的行为远不如写作的疲惫，并且最终您得到的手稿或多或少是干净的。下一个要点是严格遵守常规，我的意思是严格。我从上午9:30到12:30大约写三个小时，晚上又在6点到7点之间做一个小时的工作。最后，我给页码编号并将其放在回弹文件夹中，以奖励自己。这四个小时的日常工作全部用于撰写叙述。</p><p>  I never correct anything and I never go back to what I have written, except to the foot of the last page to see where I have got to. If you once look back, you are lost. How could you have written this drivel? How could you have used “terrible” six times on one page? And so forth. If you interrupt the writing of fast narrative with too much introspection and self-criticism, you will be lucky if you write 500 words a day and you will be disgusted with them into the bargain.</p><p>我从不更正任何内容，除了回到最后一页的脚下，看看要去的地方，我再也不会回过头来。如果您一次回头，就会迷路。你怎么能写这本书？您如何在一页上使用“可怕”六次？依此类推。如果您过多的内省和自我批评打断了快速叙事的写作，那么如果您每天写500个单词，您会很幸运，并且对它们讨价还价感到厌恶。</p><p> By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day and you aren’t disgusted with them until the book is finished, which will be, and is, in my case, in about six weeks.</p><p> 按照我的公式，您每天写2,000个字，直到这本书读完为止（在我看来，这大约是六个星期），您就不会讨厌它们。</p><p> I don’t even pause from writing to choose the right word or to verify spelling or a fact. All this can be done when your book is finished.</p><p> 我什至不会停下来选择合适的单词或验证拼写或事实。当您的书完成后，所有这些都可以完成。</p><p>  When my book is finished I spend about a week going through it and correcting the most glaring errors and rewriting passages. I then have it properly typed with chapter headings and all the rest of the trimmings. I then go through it again, have the worst pages retyped and send it off to my publisher.</p><p>  当我的书读完后，我花了大约一个星期的时间来仔细阅读并纠正最明显的错误并改写段落。然后，我用章标题和所有其他修饰词正确键入。然后，我再次进行浏览，重新输入最差的页面并将其发送给我的发布者。</p><p>  They are a sharp-eyed bunch at Jonathan Cape and, apart from commenting on the book as a whole, they make detailed suggestions which I either embody or discard. Then the final typescript goes to the printer and in due course the galley or page proofs are there and you can go over them with a fresh eye. Then the book is published and you start getting letters from people saying that Vent Vert is made by Balmain and not by Dior, that the Orient Express has vacuum and not hydraulic brakes, and that you have mousseline sauce and not Béarnaise with asparagus.</p><p>  他们在乔纳森·卡普（Jonathan Cape）眼神敏锐，除了评论整本书外，他们还提出了详细的建议，我要么予以体现，要么放弃。然后，最后的打字稿进入打印机，并在适当的时候出现厨房或页面校样，您可以重新审视它们。然后出版这本书，您会收到一些人的来信，说Vent Vert是Balmain而不是Dior制造的，Orient Express具有真空而不是液压制动器，并且您具有蛋黄酱而不是Béarnaise和芦笋。</p><p> Such mistakes are really nobody’s fault except the author’s, and they make him blush furiously when he sees them in print. But the majority of the public does not mind them or, worse, does not even notice them, and it is a salutary dig at the author’s vanity to realize how quickly the reader’s eye skips across the words which it has taken him so many months to try to arrange in the right sequence.</p><p> 这些错误实际上不是作者的错，而是作者的错误，当他看到印刷版时，这些错误会使他发红。但是大多数公众都不介意它们，或者更糟的是甚至没有注意到它们，这是作者虚荣的发掘，以了解读者的眼睛如何迅速跳过了花了他好几个月才知道的单词。尝试按正确的顺序安排。</p><p>  But what, after all these labors, are the rewards of writing and, in my case, of writing thrillers?</p><p>  但是，在完成所有这些工作之后，写作的报酬以及对我而言激动人心的写作有什么收获呢？</p><p> First of all, they are financial. You don’t make a great deal of money from royalties and translation rights and so forth and, unless you are very industrious and successful, you could only just about live on these profits, but if you sell the serial rights and the film rights, you do very well.</p><p>首先，它们是财务。您不会从特许权使用费和翻译权等方面赚到很多钱，除非您非常勤奋和成功，否则您只能靠这些利润谋生，但是如果您出售连续版权和电影版权，你做得很好。</p><p> Above all, being a comparatively successful writer is a good life. You don’t have to work at it all the time and you carry your office around in your head. And you are far more aware of the world around you.</p><p> 最重要的是，成为一个比较成功的作家是一种美好的生活。您不必一直在工作，而将您的办公室摆在脑海中。您将更加了解周围的世界。</p><p> Writing makes you more alive to your surroundings and, since the main ingredient of living, though you might not think so to look at most human beings, is to be alive, this is quite a worthwhile by-product of writing, even if you only write thrillers, whose heroes are white, the villains black, and the heroines a delicate shade of pink.</p><p> 写作使您对周围的环境更加有生命，并且既然生活的主要成分（尽管您可能不认为对大多数人这样看）是活着的，这是相当有价值的写作副产品，即使您只是写惊悚片，其中英雄是白人，恶棍是黑人，女主人公是淡淡的粉红色。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://lithub.com/ian-fleming-explains-how-to-write-a-thriller/">https://lithub.com/ian-fleming-explains-how-to-write-a-thriller/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/弗莱明/">#弗莱明</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/fleming/">#fleming</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
