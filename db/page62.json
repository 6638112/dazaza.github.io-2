A case summary of the incident details airborne police efforts to pursue and unsuccessfully identify the astonishingly powerful craft described as \u201cvery sophisticated/specialized and able to perform like no other.\u201d\n   The\u00a0 initial encounter\u00a0occurred just after 10 p.m. on Feb. 9, but was only revealed in May.\u00a0 Subsequent information\u00a0was reported earlier this month. The executive summary version is that a drone nearly collided with a Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) helicopter above Tucson. The chopper then chased the craft over a veering, 70-mile course at speeds over 100 mph and altitudes of up to 14,000 feet. During that run, the escaping uncrewed aerial system (UAS) craft violated restricted airspaces \u2013 including those of an Air Force base and Tucson\u2019s airport \u2013 and displayed maneuverability and power reserves far beyond those of a consumer drone.\n  The FBI was brought onto the case and continues searching for the craft and its pilots. Thus far, however, it appears little headway has been made toward illuminating that astonishing (and very illegal) night flight. However, Brett Tingley of  The Drive\u2019s\u00a0 War Zone\u00a0continues his excellent coverage of the story, and has obtained and\u00a0 written up reports\u00a0filed by Tucson police (TPD) whose helicopter joined the chase. At times, it\u2019s hard not to hear a bit of wonder and grudging admiration for the serious chops the law-breaking drone demonstrated before ultimately shaking them.\n The cop copter joined the chase after the CBP reported its near miss, and quickly made visual contact with the fleeing drone. They confirmed FBI descriptions of the craft having only \u201ca single, green position light on the underbody,\u201d but otherwise could not get a good enough look at it to estimate something as basic as size. Even use of night vision goggles \u2013 while looking right at it \u2013 failed to flesh the drone out further.\n  The furtive UAS then put on something of a catch-me-if-you-can show. In their report, TPD pilots say the drone \u201cmaneuvered all over the city\u2026 at about 10,500-11,000 ft\u2026 in a manner to hamper our ability to track it.\u201d Then the super-drone got really cheeky.\n The uas was very sophisticated/specialized and able to perform like no other uas I have ever observed. The uas began flying orbits around our aircraft as we tracked it\u2026 up to an altitude of 12,000 ft (the uas was in excess of 14,000ft), its speed at times well in excess of 100 mph\u2026 (From) its flight path (it) was obvious the controller had clear sight of both the helicopters tracking it by the way it would orbit us and abruptly fly behind us and attempt to avoid our visual contact.\n Despite headwinds of 40 mph, the fleeing craft managed to clear 100 mph. Though pursuing cops had hoped the prolonged hunt would exhaust the drone\u2019s batteries, it \u201cnever displayed signs of reduced\u2026 or weakening power supply.\u201d However, the TPD officers did say the craft occasionally \u201cappeared to move in an erratic pattern as if the signal with its home station was getting weaker, but then would stabilize and continue on its flight path.\u201d\n An hour after it began, the chase ended \u2013 ironically \u2013 with the TPD helicopter having to turn back for refueling, and the CBP unit unable to get another visual fix on the drone.

", "note_en": "Americans sure love their coffee. Even last spring when the pandemic shut down New York, nearly every neighborhood shop that sold takeout coffee managed to stay open, and I was amazed at how many people ventured forth to start their stay-at-home days with a favorite store-made brew.\n One elderly friend who prepandemic had traveled from Brooklyn to Manhattan by subway to buy her preferred blend of ground coffee arranged to have it delivered. \u201cWell worth the added cost,\u201d she told me. I use machine-brewed coffee from pods, and last summer when it seemed reasonably safe for me to shop I stocked up on a year\u2019s supply of the blends I like. (Happily, the pods are now recyclable.)\n All of us should be happy to know that whatever it took to secure that favorite cup of Joe may actually have  helped to keep us healthy. The  latest assessments of the health effects of coffee and caffeine, its main active ingredient, are reassuring indeed. Their consumption has been linked to a  reduced risk of all kinds of ailments, including Parkinson\u2019s disease, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, gallstones, depression, suicide, cirrhosis, liver cancer, melanoma and prostate cancer.\n In fact, in numerous studies conducted throughout the world, consuming four or five eight-ounce cups of coffee (or about 400 milligrams of caffeine) a day has been associated with reduced death rates . In a study of more than 200,000 participants followed for up to 30 years, those who drank three to five cups of coffee a day, with or without caffeine, were 15 percent  less likely to die early from all causes than were people who shunned coffee. Perhaps most dramatic was a 50 percent  reduction in the risk of suicide among both men and women who were moderate coffee drinkers, perhaps by boosting production of brain chemicals that have antidepressant effects.\n As  a report published last summer by a research team at the Harvard School of Public Health concluded, although current evidence may not warrant recommending coffee or caffeine to  prevent disease, for most people drinking coffee in moderation \u201ccan be part of a healthy lifestyle.\u201d\n It wasn\u2019t always thus. I\u2019ve lived through decades of sporadic warnings that coffee could be a health hazard. Over the years, coffee\u2019s been deemed a cause of conditions such as heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, pancreatic cancer, anxiety disorder, nutrient deficiencies, gastric reflux disease, migraine, insomnia, and premature death. As recently as 1991, the World Health Organization listed coffee as a possible carcinogen. In some of the now-discredited studies, smoking, not coffee drinking (the two often went hand-in-hand) was responsible for the purported hazard.\n \u201cThese periodic scares have given the public a very distorted view,\u201d said Dr. Walter C. Willett, professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cOverall, despite various concerns that have cropped up over the years, coffee is remarkably safe and has a number of important potential benefits.\u201d\n That\u2019s not to say coffee warrants a totally clean bill of health. Caffeine crosses the placenta into the fetus, and coffee drinking during pregnancy can increase the risk of miscarriage, low birth weight and premature birth. Pregnancy alters how the body metabolizes caffeine, and women who are pregnant or nursing are advised to abstain entirely, stick to decaf or at the very least limit their caffeine intake to less than 200 milligrams a day, the amount in about two standard cups of American coffee.\n The most common ill effect associated with caffeinated coffee is sleep disturbance. Caffeine locks into the same receptor in the brain as the neurotransmitter adenosine, a natural sedative. Dr. Willett, a co-author of the Harvard report, told me, \u201cI really do love coffee, but I have it only occasionally because otherwise I don\u2019t sleep very well. Lots of people with sleep problems don\u2019t recognize the connection to coffee.\u201d\n In  discussing his audiobook on caffeine with Terry Gross on NPR last winter, Michael Pollan called caffeine \u201cthe enemy of good sleep\u201d because it interferes with deep sleep. He confessed that after the challenging task of weaning himself from coffee, he \u201cwas sleeping like a teenager again.\u201d\n Dr. Willett, now 75, said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to get to zero consumption to minimize the impact on sleep,\u201d but he acknowledged that a person\u2019s sensitivity to caffeine \u201cprobably increases with age.\u201d People also vary widely in how rapidly they metabolize caffeine, enabling some to sleep soundly after drinking caffeinated coffee at dinner while others have trouble sleeping if they have coffee at lunch. But even if you can fall asleep readily after an evening coffee, it may disrupt your ability to get adequate deep sleep, Mr. Pollan states in his forthcoming book, \u201cThis Is Your Mind on Plants.\u201d\n Dr. Willett said it\u2019s possible to develop a degree of tolerance to caffeine\u2019s effect on sleep. My 75-year-old brother, an inveterate imbiber of caffeinated coffee, claims it has no effect on him. However, acquiring a tolerance to caffeine could blunt its benefit if, say, you wanted it to help you stay alert and focused while driving or taking a test.\n Caffeine is one of more than a thousand chemicals in coffee, not all of which are beneficial. Among others with positive effects are polyphenols and antioxidants. Polyphenols can inhibit the growth of cancer cells and lower the risk of Type 2 diabetes; antioxidants, which have anti-inflammatory effects, can counter both heart disease and cancer, the nation\u2019s leading killers.\n None of this means coffee is beneficial regardless of how it\u2019s prepared. When brewed without a paper filter, as in French press, Norwegian boiled coffee, espresso or Turkish coffee, oily chemicals called diterpenes come through that can raise artery-damaging LDL cholesterol. However, these chemicals are virtually absent in both filtered and instant coffee. Knowing I have a cholesterol problem, I dissected a coffee pod and found a paper filter lining the plastic cup. Whew!\n Also countering the potential health benefits of coffee are popular additions some people use, like cream and sweet syrups, that can convert this calorie-free beverage into a calorie-rich dessert. \u201cAll the things people put into coffee can result in a junk food with as many as 500 to 600 calories,\u201d Dr. Willett said. A 16-ounce  Starbucks Mocha Frappuccino, for example, has 51 grams of sugar, 15 grams of fat (10 of them saturated) and 370 calories.\n With iced coffee season approaching, more people are likely to turn to cold-brew coffee. Now rising in popularity, cold brew counters coffee\u2019s natural acidity and the bitterness that results when boiling water is poured over the grounds. Cold brew is made by  steeping the grounds in cold water for several hours, then straining the liquid through a paper filter to remove the grounds and harmful diterpenes and keep the flavor and caffeine for you to enjoy. Cold brew can also be made with decaffeinated coffee.\n Decaf is not totally without health benefits. As with caffeinated coffee, the polyphenols it contains have anti-inflammatory properties that may lower the risk of Type 2 diabetes and cancer.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 09:59:37", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5496\u5561,benefits", "title": "\u5496\u5561\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u76ca\u5904 ", "title_en": "The Health Benefits of Coffee", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/14/well/eat/coffee-health-benefits.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5496\u5561", "benefits"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "80354baa89ae69603cbfc4191b27b17f.jpg", "infoid": 1067879, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6839\u636e\u65b0\u95fb\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u67cf\u514b\u90e1\u54c8\u745f\u74e6\u5e2d\u8d1d\u65af\u5361\u5c14\u4e3b\u5e2d\u548c\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u5ba3\u5e03\u8f9e\u804c\uff0c\u5ba3\u5e03\uff0c\u8f9e\u804c\u662f\u8f9e\u804c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4f8b\u8349\u6848\u548c\u6885\u6797\u8fbe\u76d6\u8328\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u7684\u53d7\u6258\u4eba\u3002\n \u6bd4\u5c14\u548c\u6885\u7433\u8fbe\u76d6\u8328\u5ba3\u5e03\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e8e2021\u5e745\u6708\u8131\u843d\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bb8\u591a\u4eba\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7834\u788e\u7684\u516c\u544a\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5173\u4e8e\u4ed6\u4eec\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5168\u4e16\u754c\u7ed3\u675f\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u8ffd\u6c42\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u516c\u544a\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u50a8\u5b58\u4f17\u591a\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n \u8be5\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d44\u52a9\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u810a\u9ad3\u7070\u8d28\u708e\uff0c\u8425\u517b\uff0c\u519c\u4e1a\uff0c\u5168\u7403\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u536b\u751f\uff0c\u827e\u6ecb\u75c5\u6bd2\uff0c\u759f\u75be\uff0c\u70df\u8349\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u75ab\u82d7\uff0c\u6027\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49......\u548c\u6211\u4eec\u521a\u521a\u5165\u95e8\u3002\n \u5b83\uff06\uff0339;\u771f\u6b63\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u3002\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u4e8c\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u5df2\u7ecf\u53d1\u5c55\u5230\u8d85\u8fc71,600\u540d\u5458\u5de5\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7548\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u603b\u4ed8\u6b3e\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5b83\u5e76\u4e0d\u5938\u5f20\u5730\u8bf4\uff0c\u57fa\u7840\u662f\u5b8c\u5168\u6539\u53d8\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002\n  \u572890\u5c81\u65f6\uff0c\u81ea\u52a9\u9910\u6350\u8d60\u4e86\u4ef7\u503c410\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4f2f\u514b\u5e0c\u5c14\u80a1\u7968\u5230\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u3002\u5728\u4eca\u5929\u548c\u7b2c39\u9875\u7684\u516c\u544a\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ed6\u8865\u5145\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ed6\u6350\u8d60\u4e86\u989d\u5916\u768441\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u6ca1\u6709\u7ed9\u51fa\u4ed6\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002\n \uff06\uff0334;\u4eca\u5929\u662f\u6211\u7684\u91cc\u7a0b\u7891\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u5df4\u83f2\u7279\u5728\u4e00\u4efd\u58f0\u660e\u4e2d\u5199\u9053\u3002 \uff06\uff0334;\u57282006\u5e74\uff0c\u6211\u627f\u8bfa\u5206\u53d1\u6211\u6240\u6709\u7684\u4f2f\u514b\u5e0c\u5c14\u6d77\u745f\u8587\u80a1\u7968 - \u8d85\u8fc799\uff05\u7684\u51c0\u503c - \u6148\u5584\u4e8b\u4e1a\u3002\u968f\u7740\u4eca\u5929\u768441\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u6211\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\n \u5df4\u83f2\u7279\u4ece\u76d6\u8328\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u7684\u8f9e\u804c\u8f9e\u804c\u4e3a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u6bd4\u5c14\u76d6\u8328\u548c\u6885\u7433\u8fbe\u6cd5\u56fd\u5927\u95e8\u7684\u516c\u544a\u4e4b\u540e;\u79bb\u5a5a\u3002 \n\uff06\uff0334;\u591a\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u6211\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u6258\u4eba - \u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u6d3b\u52a8\u53d7\u52a9\u8005 - \u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u6536\u4ef6\u4eba\u7684\u8d44\u91d1\uff0c\u7968\u636e\u548cMelinda Gates\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\uff08BMG\uff09\u3002 \u6211\u73b0\u5728\u6b63\u5728\u8f9e\u804c\uff0c\u5c31\u50cf\u6211\u5728\u4f2f\u514b\u5e0c\u5c14\u4ee5\u5916\u7684\u6240\u6709\u516c\u53f8\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u6240\u505a\u7684\u90a3\u6837\uff0c\u201c\u5df4\u83f2\u7279\u8bf4\u3002 \u201cBMG\u7684\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u662fMark Suzman\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u8fd1\u671f\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u8c01\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u6211\u7684\u5168\u529b\u652f\u6301\u3002 \u6211\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u540c\u6b65100\uff05\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u8eab\u4f53\u53c2\u4e0e\u7edd\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76ee\u6807\u3002\uff06\uff0334;

For many, it was an earth-shattering announcement, one that raises a host of questions about the future of their foundation and its quest to end disease worldwide. This latest announcement adds to the growing number of questions about what&#39;s in store for the many enterprises currently being managed by the Gates Foundation.\n The foundation supplies grants to researchers studying polio, nutrition, agriculture, global education, sanitation, HIV, malaria, tobacco control, vaccines, gender inequality...and we&#39;re just getting started.\n It&#39;s a truly massive enterprise. The foundation has grown to over 1,600 employees over the last two decades and has issued total payments in excess of $54.8 billion, so it&#39;s not an overstatement to say that the foundation is quite literally transforming the world.\n  At the age of 90, Buffet has donated $41 billion worth of Berkshire stock to the five foundations. In today&#39;s announcement, he added that he has donated an extra $4.1 billion, but\u00a0he didn&#39;t give a reason for his decision.\n &#34;Today is a milestone for me,&#34; Buffett wrote in a statement. &#34;In 2006, I pledged to distribute all of my Berkshire Hathaway shares \u2014 more than 99% of my net worth \u2014 to philanthropy. With today\u2019s $4.1 billion distribution, I\u2019m halfway there.&#34;\n Buffett\u2019s resignation from the Gates Foundation board comes at an unprecedented time for the organization, especially following the announcement of founders Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates&#39; divorce.\n &#34;For years I have been a trustee \u2014 an inactive trustee at that \u2014 of only one recipient of my funds, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMG). I am now resigning from that post, just as I have done at all corporate boards other than Berkshire\u2019s,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cThe CEO of BMG is Mark Suzman, an outstanding recent selection who has my full support. My goals are 100% in sync with those of the foundation, and my physical participation is in no way needed to achieve these goals.&#34;\n  This is a breaking story and will be regularly updated as new information becomes available.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 09:16:07", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5df4\u83f2\u7279,\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a,buffett,\u8f9e\u804c", "title": "\u6c83\u4f26\u5df4\u83f2\u7279\u4ece\u6bd4\u5c14\u548c\u6885\u7433\u8fbe\u76d6\u8328\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u8f9e\u804c ", "title_en": "Warren Buffett Resigns From Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation", "transed": 1, "url": "https://interestingengineering.com/warren-buffett-resigns-from-bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5df4\u83f2\u7279", "\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a", "buffett", "\u8f9e\u804c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "efe63fc2d79fb2edfa85bf16a8739ee2.jpg", "infoid": 1067878, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8d77\u521d\uff0c\u4ece\u5bb6\u91cc\u5de5\u4f5c\u89c9\u5f97\u50cf\u9003\u8131\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e1c\u897f\u3002\u4eba\u4eec\u5728\u547c\u5524\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e3e\u884c\u4e00\u6b21\u6c57\u886b\u548c\u6324\u538b\u7684\u547c\u53eb\u4e2d\u6324\u538b\u65f6\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u6b22\u8fce\u3002\u901a\u52e4\u840e\u7f29\u548c\u67d4\u97e7\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u6ca1\u6709\u4eba\u62c5\u5fc3\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5348\u9910\u53c8\u4ece\u516c\u5171\u51b0\u7bb1\u91cc\u5077\u4e86\u3002\n \u7136\u540e\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e00\u5e74\u591a\u7684\u62e8\u53f7\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8367\u5149\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f00\u59cb\u62db\u624b\u3002\u5728\u4e1c\u5317\u548c\u897f\u90e8\u7684\u4e09\u4f4d\u6570\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u70ed\u6d6a\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u5458\u5de5\u5f00\u59cb\u6000\u7591\u8349\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u66f4\u73af\u4fdd\u7684 -

People rejoiced in taking meetings in sweatpants and squeezing in a load of laundry between calls. Commutes shrank and flexibility expanded. Nobody worried about their lunch being stolen from the communal fridge anymore.\n Then, after more than a year of dialing in, the physical office, in all its fluorescence, began to beckon.  After a  heat wave in the Northeast and  triple-digit temperatures in the West, some employees started to wonder if the grass might be greener \u2014 or, at least, the cubicle cooler \u2014 on the other side.\n \u201cI\u2019ve started going into work a few days a week to take advantage of the air-conditioning,\u201d said Courtney Walsh, a librarian at an intellectual property firm in Boston, whose third-floor apartment gets stiflingly hot.\n Ms. Walsh, 44, usually waits until July to install her window unit, but this year she cracked in early June, when she realized \u201cclutching the ice packs from my grocery delivery wasn\u2019t a long-term solution.\u201d Still, she said, while her modest A.C. takes the edge off, it\u2019s not as effective (or free) as her office\u2019s central air.\n \u201cI have to run it for hours before a meeting, which drives up my utility bill,\u201d she said. \u201cThen it\u2019s so loud while I\u2019m trying to talk that I have to turn it off. So then I\u2019m immediately sweating again.\u201d\n Globally, less than a third of households own an air-conditioner, according to  a 2018 report from the International Energy Agency. And even in countries like the United States, where almost 90 percent of homes have some kind of A.C., all that cooling doesn\u2019t come cheap.\n The U.S. government\u2019s most recent  Residential Energy Consumption Survey, completed in 2015, found that  Americans spend an average of $265 on air-conditioning annually. (For those in the hot-humid climate zone that stretches from Florida to southeastern Texas, that figure is closer to $525.)\n Earlier this year, Michelle Ozuna asked her boss if she could start going back into the office twice a week. While she loves the charm of her studio apartment in Anaheim, Calif., the building has no central air and the windows can barely keep out the heat.\n \u201cI\u2019ve got my portable air-conditioner on my left, a fan on my right, and I\u2019m still miserable,\u201d said Ms. Ozuna, 44, who works in human resources for a community college. \u201cI realized I really need to be in the office for my own sanity. I just want to be freezing again.\u201d\n Seeking the solace of air-conditioned spaces is nothing new, said Salvatore Basile, the author of \u201cCool: How Air-Conditioning Changed Everything.\u201d Though New York City\u2019s yellow cabs  weren\u2019t required to have A.C. until 1990, the city ran an experiment in the 1950s in which it put a fleet of 50 air-conditioned taxis on the streets, advertising their advantage with a bright blue sticker on the windshield.\n \u201cMany drivers reported that a large proportion of their rides came from people who actually didn\u2019t even want to go anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just wanted to be driven around a while to cool off.\u201d\n Still, when Willis Carrier \u2014 widely regarded as the inventor of modern air-conditioning \u2014 installed his \u201capparatus for treating air\u201d in 1902 in the Brooklyn printing plant where he worked, keeping his fellow employees comfortable wasn\u2019t top of mind.\n \u201cThe first attempts to cool buildings and factories were made to protect machinery and equipment, not to benefit people,\u201d Mr. Basile said. \u201cThe notion of \u2018comfort cooling,\u2019 as we know it, was actually a fairly late idea.\u201d\n The first high-rise air-conditioned office building in the United States \u2014 the 21-story Milam Building in San Antonio \u2014 didn\u2019t open until 1928, and even then it was something of an anomaly, Mr. Basile said.\n \u201cThe idea of installing air-conditioning in an office was expensive, and the ductwork took up a lot of space,\u201d he said. \u201cWorkers got nothing from management but awnings free of charge, and it was B.Y.O. electric fans.\u201d\n By 1951, the Empire State Building was air-conditioned, and in 1953, the Woolworth Building followed suit \u2014 though only in a third of its offices. When the Chrysler Building joined the party in 1954, \u201cit was becoming apparent that A.C. was a must in the modern American office,\u201d Mr. Basile said.\n  \u201cBefore Covid, you were usually at work during the dog days of summer, so you didn\u2019t realize how grim it could get at home,\u201d said Eileen Pozniak, a project manager who moved to London from New York 10 years ago.\n \u201cLast summer was awful because it was so hot and we couldn\u2019t go in at all,\u201d Ms. Pozniak, 38, said. \u201cNow I plan to go in as much as I can.\u201d\n John Tranfaglia, a 29-year-old policy analyst with the University of Michigan Health System, wishes he could do the same. His one wheezing window unit is fighting an uphill battle against the muggy Midwestern summer, but his team can\u2019t go back to the office until the fall.\n When he stopped by last month to grab a few things, the temperature hit him immediately. \u201cIt was so cold in there,\u201d Mr. Tranfaglia said. \u201cI was so envious.\u201d\n While nobody likes sticking to their seat through a meeting, discomfort isn\u2019t the only concern for workers sweating it out from home.\n \u201cIf I\u2019m shiny and flushed onscreen, I worry I don\u2019t seem as professional,\u201d said Rachel Bowles, a 37-year-old dietitian in Santa Clara, Calif. \u201cIt makes me feel like I have less authority.\u201d\n Even though her appointments are still virtual, she\u2019s been going into the office just so she can video chat from an air-conditioned space.\n \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on women, especially younger women, to look put together in order to be taken seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we\u2019re visibly sweaty, we can be perceived as nervous or frazzled.\u201d\n Kate O\u2019Berry, a 36-year-old analyst in New Bedford, Mass., also sees the office, and its consistently low temperatures, as a place where she feels most in control.\n \u201cIn my mind, I have Work Kate and Home Kate,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for the last year and a half, I\u2019ve had to be Work Kate at home, with all my messes and interruptions and distractions.\u201d Returning to her air-conditioned office \u201cmakes me feel normal,\u201d she said.\n Not everyone is excited about having a subsidized place to cool off. A  2015 study revealed that most office buildings set their temperatures based on  a formula developed in the 1960s that uses the metabolic rates of men \u2014 meaning plenty of employees find it far too cold for comfort.\n \u201cI\u2019m not looking forward to the A.C.-induced shivering again,\u201d said Emily Shields, 36, a content designer in Chicago, whose office thermostat is set so low that she\u2019s spent many a summer workday running her hands under the hot water in the bathroom just to get the feeling back.\n She and her husband have compromised on the air-conditioning while they both work from home. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten used to being able to work with a blanket on my lap whenever I need, including when I give important presentations,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sad that that will be going away.\u201d\n As for Ms. Walsh, she has already planned her next trip to the office for a brief reprieve from Boston\u2019s humidity. But even she recognizes the double-edged sword of the workplace A.C.\n \u201cIt\u2019s awful, and it\u2019s the best,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going back in again in a few days and I can\u2019t wait. I\u2019ll don my office cardigan after an hour or two, and it\u2019ll be bliss.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-24 09:14:49", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News",

", "note_en": "Peloton\u2019s Treadmills cost between $2,500 and $4,000. They\u2019ve also injured  70 people and killed  one child. Peloton issued a recall on the treadmills after an  investigation by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). Those who kept the Tread+ got a nasty shock in their inbox recently: After the treadmill downloaded an update Peloton said was designed to make the device safer, users reported they could no longer run on it without paying Peloton a $39.99 per month subscription fee.\n    \u201cWe care deeply about the safety and well being of our Members and we created Tread Lock to secure your Tread+ against unauthorized access,\u201d Peloton said in  an email it sent to customers. \u201cUnfortunately at this time \u2018Just Runn\u2019 is no longer accessible without a Peloton Membership.\u201d It offered to waive the subscription fee for the first three months and apologized for the inconvenience.   Peloton\u2019s subscription ecosystem provides users with live classes, crafted playlists, and customized tracks. For people who just want to run or bike, they can select the \u201cJust Bike\u201d or \u201cJust Run\u201d feature and use their devices like normal exercise equipment. Unless, of course, the user has updated the Tread+ to get the safety update.\n  After footage of children getting  injured on treadmills circulated online and CPSC issued its warning, Peloton founder CEO and founder John Foley released a  statement calling the warning \u201cmisleading and inaccurate.\u201d CSPC noted that the Pelton treadmill was uniquely dangerous because of its design, noting that its height off the ground and tread design caused objects and people to more easily slide under the machine.\n   \u201cWe design and build all of our products with safety in mind. But in order to help ensure that you and your family members stay safe with Peloton products in your home, we need your help,\u201d Foley said in his statement. He urged Tread+ users to make sure the space around the device was clear of pets and children and to lock the safety key up between uses. Peloton initially refused to issue a recall but relented after the CPSC issued its statement.\n  The new Tread Lock update adds another layer of safety to the Tread+. \u201cTread Lock is a safety feature that automatically locks the Peloton Tread+ after you put your Tread+ to sleep or after 45 seconds of inactivity outside of a class,\u201d Peloton  said on its website.\n  For now, the cost of using that new feature is, apparently, about $40 a month, though Peloton claimed it would not always be so. \u201cUnfortunately due to current technical limitations, Tread Lock is not yet available without a Peloton Membership,\u201d Peloton told Motherboard in an email. \u201cWe understand that this is an inconvenience for some and are working on updates to Tread Lock that will allow us to make Tread Lock and Just Run available without a Peloton Membership.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-24 08:30:42", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8dd1\u6b65\u673a,treadmill,peloton", "title": "Peloton\u8dd1\u6b65\u673a\u5b89\u5168\u66f4\u65b0\u9700\u8981\u6bcf\u670840\u7f8e\u5143\u8ba2\u9605 ", "title_en": "Peloton Treadmill Safety Update Requires $40 a Month Subscription", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.vice.com/en/article/4avnzg/peloton-treadmill-safety-update-requires-dollar40-a-month-subscription", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8dd1\u6b65\u673a", "treadmill", "peloton"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "2bb3c0bf4fcaa4278e6a56931e606f12.jpg", "infoid": 1067872, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5b54\u96c0\u53d1\u5c04\u8fd1\u4e00\u5e74\uff0cNBCuniversal\u7684Marquee Streaming\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ec8\u4e8e\u6765\u4e86\u7535\u89c6\u548c\u6d88\u9632\u7247\u3002\n Streaming Service\u5c06\u4e8e6\u670824\u65e5\u6b63\u5f0f\u5230\u8fbe\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u8bbf\u95ee\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u516c\u53f8\u5468\u4e09\u5ba3\u5e03\u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5c06\u5728\u6d88\u9632\u7535\u89c6\u4ea7\u54c1\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6d88\u9632\u7535\u89c6\u68d2\u7cbe\u7b80\uff0c\u706b\u7535\u89c6\u68d24K\u548c\u706b\u7535\u89c6\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u89c6\u3002\u5b54\u96c0\u53d1\u8a00\u4eba\u544a\u8bc9\u8fb9\u7f18\uff0c\u5373\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4ee3\u706b\u7535\u89c6\u53ca\u4ee5\u4e0a\u5c06\u6709\u652f\u6301\u8be5\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u5e26\u6709\u6d88\u9632OS 5\u53ca\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u6d88\u9632\u7247\u3002\n \u9664\u5b54\u96c0\u5916\uff0c\u5206\u9500\u534f\u8bae\u8fd8\u5c06\u770b\u523015\u4e2aNBCuniversal Apps\u8fd8\u7ed9\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5404\u79cdNBC\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548cTelemundo\u3002\u5b54\u96c0\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u662f\u514d\u8d39\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4efb\u4f55\u4e00\u4e2a\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u4ed8\u8d39\u5c42\u89e3\u9501\u66f4\u591a\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u539f\u4ef6\u3002\u5b54\u96c0\u7684\u4f18\u8d28\u5e7f\u544a\u652f\u6301\u7684\u4e00\u5c42\u6bcf\u6708\u8017\u8d395\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u5e7f\u544a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6bcf\u670810\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n \u652f\u6301\u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u652f\u6301\u5c06\u4f7f\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bbf\u95eeNBCuniversal\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u7f16\u7a0b\u76ee\u5f55 -

The companies announced Wednesday that the app would be supported across Fire TV products, including Fire TV Stick Lite, Fire TV Stick 4K, and Fire TV smart TVs. A Peacock spokesperson told  The Verge that second-generation Fire TVs and above will have support for the app, as will all Fire Tablets with Fire OS 5 and above.\n In addition to Peacock, the distribution agreement will see 15 NBCUniversal apps arrive on Amazon devices as well, including various NBC apps and Telemundo. Much of Peacock\u2019s content is available to stream for free, but users can unlock more content and originals with either of the service\u2019s paid tiers. Peacock\u2019s premium ad-supported tier costs $5 per month, while its ad-free experience costs $10 per month.\n Support for the app will give streamers access not only to NBCUniversal\u2019s catalog of network programming \u2014 including popular series like  The Office,  30 Rock, and  Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit \u2014 but also to coverage of various sporting events. These include Sunday Night Football, the Tokyo Olympics, and, because Peacock has  exclusive rights to the WWE Network, SummerSlam.\n Previously, Fire TV users who\u2019d hoped to access event coverage exclusive to the service would either have to find another way to stream it or sideload it themselves \u2014 something Peacock itself  previously encouraged its frustrated users to try as a workaround.\n When support arrives tomorrow, Fire TV users will be able to open and search the service\u2019s catalog using voice commands. The companies said that later this year, users will get further Alexa support and the ability to surf Peacock using an Alexa Voice Remote, a Fire TV Cube, or by pairing an Echo device to a Fire TV

", "note_en": "Retired New Zealand weightlifter and former Olympian Tracey Lambrechs warned Thursday that transgender athletes will eventually \u201cknock women out of sport\u201d unless action is taken.\n Lambrechs competed in the same weight class as transgender athlete Laurel Hubbard after Hubbard, born biologically male, transitioned in 2013 and began competing in women\u2019s weightlifting competitions. Lambrechs said she lost all of her weightlifting records soon after Hubbard began competing.\n \u201cI was like \u2018What do you mean? There\u2019s no one that\u2019s close to me,\u2019\u201d Lambrechs said during an interview with  Fox News, recalling a phone call she received from her coach letting her know that Hubbard had eclipsed her lifting records and beat her out of the number one spot for their weight class. \u201cLaurel started weightlifting, and she competed on the weekend. So as of now, you\u2019re number two.\u201d\n Hubbard is set to  become the first openly transgender person to compete in the Olympics after winning a spot on the New Zealand national team. At 43 years old, Hubbard is currently the oldest weightlifter competing.\n Lambrechs said that trans athletes could eventually destroy women\u2019s sports by forcing out all biologically female competitors.\n  \u201cIt\u2019s honestly going to knock women out of sport. Women are not going to want to participate in something where there isn\u2019t opportunity for them to win medals or go to international competition,\u201d she said.\n After Hubbard beat Lambrechs out of her records, Lambrechs was given little recourse if she wanted to continue competing.\n \u201cI was told by the national weightlifting body that I either needed to drop a weight category or look at retiring,\u201d Lambrechs said. Lambrechs ultimately decided to drop a weight class so that she could continue competing.\n  Each nation is capped at sending just one athlete per weight class for major weightlifting competitions. Lambrechs lost nearly 40 pounds in three months to drop weight classes and continue competing.\n \u201cI just did what I had to do to accomplish my goal of competing at my third Commonwealth Games. It meant a lot to me to show the Commonwealth that I wasn\u2019t knocked out that easily,\u201d Lambrechs said.\n Lambrechs has previously  claimed that athletes have been warned to be silent about transgender competitors in women\u2019s sports. In May, she said that sport was being taken away from women because of committees allowing biological men to compete against them.\n  \u201cI\u2019m quite disappointed, quite disappointed for the female athlete who will lose out on that spot,\u201d Lambrechs said. \u201cWe\u2019re all about equality for women in sport, but right now that equality is being taken away from us.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve had female weightlifters come up to me and say, \u2018What do we do? This isn\u2019t fair, what do we do?\u2019 Unfortunately, there\u2019s nothing we can do because every time we voice it we get told to be quiet,\u201d she added.\n  The Daily Wire is one of America\u2019s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

Thanks to this reconstruction, we can now see that the composition as it was painted by Rembrandt was even more dynamic,&#34; Rijksmuseum director Taco Dibbits said.\n &#34;It is wonderful to be able to now see with our own eyes The Night Watch as Rembrandt intended it to be seen.&#34;\n   The Night Watch is considered Rembrandt&#39;s most ambitious work. It was commissioned by the mayor and leader of the civic guard of Amsterdam, Frans Banninck Cocq, who wanted a group portrait of his militia company.\n Prior to the restoration the painting was nearly 4m tall and 4.5m wide (12.5 x 15 ft) and weighed 337kg (743lb). As well as being famous for its size, the piece is acclaimed for its use of dramatic lighting and movement.\n In 1975, a man armed with a bread knife fought off a museum guard and slashed the painting, telling bystanders that he &#34;did it for the Lord&#34;.\n The piece was also attacked with a knife in 1911 and sprayed with a chemical in 1990, but only minor damage occurred on both occasions that was relatively easy to repair.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 07:44:38", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e,helps,\u73b0\u5728", "title":

", "note_en": "Where does your enterprise stand on the AI adoption curve? Take our  AI survey to find out.\n Adobe has launched  Substance 3D tools that take advantage of AI technology for immersive creation.\n The tools are aimed at making more realistic special effects, gaming, and entertainment imagery. They are also targeted at wider industries that similarly require a precision realism in design, said Sebastien Deguy (the vice president of 3D and immersive at Adobe) in an interview with GamesBeat.\n  \u201cTwo-and-a-half years ago, my company [Allegorithmic] was acquired to do 3D and immersive design,\u201d Deguy said. \u201cWe created this new division called 3D immersive. And the goal for this division is to provide a set of\u00a0 ecosystem of applications from Adobe for the 3d community, including game developers. It\u2019s for the studios we currently serve with our software products but also the new designers who are interested in 3D.\u201d\n Adobe acquired  Allegorithmic because of the potential it saw in the future of 3D technology. Since then, Adobe has been working on expanding Substance 3D.\n  \u201cCreators and designers in other industries beyond the game industry are adopting these game technologies,\u201d Deguy said. \u201cThere is a lot of room to grow. Most of the actual 3D tools are really complex and complicated to learn. Our tools are really well defined and easy to get into. We\u2019re trying to make it more accessible.\u201d\n But Adobe isn\u2019t making toys, either. It is targeting a new generation of designers who are just starting to use 3D in their processes. Substance 3D uses artificial intelligence to eliminate much of the technical complexity of 3D design and features the \u201cwhat you see is what you get\u201d interface artists know from  Photoshop\u00a0or\u00a0 Illustrator. And the collection isn\u2019t just about tools \u2014 it also includes thousands of models, textures, lighting systems, and other assets designers can use to jump-start projects.\n One of the main concerns of 3D artists and designers today \u2014 whether in game development, VFX, or product design \u2014 is that the design process is really fragmented. They need to jump between various tools as part of their workflows. The Adobe Substance 3D Collection was designed to connect seamlessly with Adobe Creative Cloud in order to drastically help streamline this process, allowing 3D artists to switch between Substance, Photoshop, InDesign, and more. Also, Adobe says this will help creatives curious about 3D quickly adopt and learn the tools because they are accustomed to the interface and the Creative Cloud, Deguy said.\n   Substance 3D includes four new tools and an expanded ecosystem, including an expanded library of thousands of customizable 3D assets.\n Deguy said that the tool can be used in industries like architecture, fashion, food/beverage, and more. The tool can easily be integrated into design processes, regardless of experience level, he said.\n One of the new tools is Stager, which can assemble 3D models, materials, and lighting in a 3D scene and produce virtual photography. It gets a big boost from machine learning, Deguy said.\n   The third tool is Modeler, which will soon be available for private beta. Modeler connects virtual reality and desktop for a more immersive design process and organic sculpting.\n And the last tool is the 3D Asset Library, an expanded library of thousands of customizable 3D assets to feed creatives\u2019 workflow. The toolkit also provides access to Creative Cloud\u2019s fonts library, storage, and more.\n One example where the tools are useful is virtual photography.\u00a0Due to the pandemic, most brands/companies had to discontinue all photo or video shoots. By generating photorealistic renderings of products, companies like  Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s save time and money while creating lifelike images for marketing, promotion, and other uses.\n  Rival solutions come from Autodesk, Unity, and Unreal. The Substance 3D tools are interoperable with a lot of the competition, though, as standards such as Pixar\u2019s Universal Scene Description (USD) are spreading through simulation tools such as  Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse, Deguy said.\n Guido Quaroni is the director of engineering and 3D immersive at Adobe, but before that, he was at Pixar, where he was responsible for open-sourcing USD.  In a panel at the 2021 GPU Technology Conference (GTC), he said the idea of USD emerged at Pixar in 2010 as the company was dealing with multiple libraries that dealt with large scenes in its movies.\n  \u201cSome of the ideas in USD go back 20 years to  Toy Story 2, but the idea was to formalize it and write it in a way that we could eventually open source it,\u201d Quaroni said on my panel at GTC 2021.\n  Deguy said, \u201cWe want to make sure that we connect our teams and they talk to each other. And one of the things also that will help new designers to get into our offering is the fact that we will connect normally to the Omniverse and the Unity companies of this world, but also Photoshop and Illustrator and all the Create tools. We\u2019re at the same company, so we can connect.\u201d\n GamesBeat&#39;s creed when covering the game industry is &#34;where passion meets business.&#34; What does this mean?

", "note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  In  mathematical logic and  computer science,  homotopy type theory ( HoTT    /  h \u0252 t/) refers to various lines of development of  intuitionistic type theory, based on the interpretation of types as objects to which the intuition of (abstract)  homotopy theory applies.\n This includes, among other lines of work, the construction of homotopical and  higher-categorical  models for such type theories; the use of type theory as a logic (or  internal language) for abstract homotopy theory and  higher category theory; the development of mathematics within a type-theoretic  foundation (including both previously existing mathematics and new mathematics that homotopical types make possible); and the  formalization of each of these in computer  proof assistants.\n There is a large overlap between the work referred to as homotopy type theory, and as the  univalent foundations project. Although neither is precisely delineated, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, the choice of usage also sometimes corresponds to differences in viewpoint and emphasis.  [1] As such, this article may not represent the views of all researchers in the fields equally. This kind of variability is unavoidable when a field is in rapid flux.\n    At one time the idea that types in  intensional type theory with their identity types could be regarded as  groupoids was  mathematical folklore. It was first made precise semantically in the 1998 paper of Martin Hofmann and  Thomas Streicher called &#34;The groupoid interpretation of type theory&#34;, in which they showed that intensional type theory had a model in the category of  groupoids.  [2] This was the first truly &#34; homotopical&#34; model of type theory, albeit only &#34;1- dimensional&#34; (the traditional models in the  category of sets being homotopically 0-dimensional).\n Their paper also foreshadowed several later developments in homotopy type theory. For instance, they noted that the groupoid model satisfies a rule they called &#34;universe extensionality&#34;, which is none other than the restriction to 1-types of the  univalence axiom that  Vladimir Voevodsky proposed ten years later. (The axiom for 1-types is notably simpler to formulate, however, since a  coherent notion of &#34;equivalence&#34; is not required.) They also defined &#34;categories with isomorphism as equality&#34; and conjectured that in a model using higher-dimensional groupoids, for such categories one would have &#34;equivalence is equality&#34;; this was later proven by Benedikt Ahrens, Krzysztof Kapulkin, and  Michael Shulman.  [3]\n  The first higher-dimensional models of intensional type theory were constructed by  Steve Awodey and his student Michael Warren in 2005 using  Quillen model categories. These results were first presented in public at the conference FMCS 2006  [4] at which Warren gave a talk titled &#34;Homotopy models of intensional type theory&#34;, which also served as his thesis prospectus (the dissertation committee present were Awodey, Nicola Gambino and Alex Simpson). A summary is contained in Warren&#39;s thesis prospectus abstract.  [5]\n At a subsequent workshop about identity types at  Uppsala University in 2006  [6] there were two talks about the relation between intensional type theory and factorization systems: one by Richard Garner, &#34;Factorisation systems for type theory&#34;,  [7] and one by Michael Warren, &#34;Model categories and intensional identity types&#34;. Related ideas were discussed in the talks by Steve Awodey, &#34;Type theory of higher-dimensional categories&#34;, and  Thomas Streicher, &#34;Identity types vs. weak omega-groupoids: some ideas, some problems&#34;. At the same conference Benno van den Berg gave a talk titled &#34;Types as weak omega-categories&#34; where he outlined the ideas that later became the subject of a joint paper with Richard Garner.\n All early constructions of higher dimensional models had to deal with the problem of coherence typical of models of dependent type theory, and various solutions were developed. One such was given in 2009 by Voevodsky, another in 2010 by van den Berg and Garner.  [8] A general solution, building on Voevodsky&#39;s construction, was eventually given by Lumsdaine and Warren in 2014.  [9]\n At the PSSL86 in 2007  [10] Awodey gave a talk titled &#34;Homotopy type theory&#34; (this was the first public usage of that term, which was coined by Awodey  [11]). Awodey and Warren summarized their results in the paper &#34;Homotopy theoretic models of identity types&#34;, which was posted on the  ArXiv preprint server in 2007  [12] and published in 2009; a more detailed version appeared in Warren&#39;s thesis &#34;Homotopy theoretic aspects of constructive type theory&#34; in 2008.\n At about the same time, Vladimir Voevodsky was independently investigating type theory in the context of the search of a language for practical formalization of mathematics. In September 2006 he posted to the Types mailing list &#34;A very short note on homotopy  lambda calculus&#34;,  [13] which sketched the outlines of a type theory with dependent products, sums and universes and of a model of this type theory in Kan  simplicial sets. It began by saying &#34;The homotopy \u03bb-calculus is a hypothetical (at the moment) type system&#34; and ended with &#34;At the moment much of what I said above is at the level of conjectures. Even the definition of the model of TS in the homotopy category is non-trivial&#34; referring to the complex coherence issues that were not resolved until 2009. This note included a syntactic definition of &#34;equality types&#34; that were claimed to be interpreted in the model by path-spaces, but did not consider  Per Martin-L\u00f6f&#39;s rules for identity types. It also stratified the universes by homotopy dimension in addition to size, an idea that later was mostly discarded.\n On the syntactic side, Benno van den Berg conjectured in 2006 that the tower of identity types of a type in intensional type theory should have the structure of an \u03c9-category, and indeed a \u03c9-groupoid, in the &#34;globular, algebraic&#34; sense of Michael Batanin. This was later proven independently by van den Berg and Garner in the paper &#34;Types are weak omega-groupoids&#34; (published 2008),  [14] and by Peter Lumsdaine in the paper &#34;Weak \u03c9-Categories from Intensional Type Theory&#34; (published 2009) and as part of his 2010 Ph.D. thesis &#34;Higher Categories from Type Theories&#34;.  [15]\n  The concept of a univalent fibration was introduced by Voevodsky in early 2006.  [16]However, because of the insistence of all presentations of the Martin-L\u00f6f type theory on the property that the identity types, in the empty context, may contain only reflexivity, Voevodsky did not recognize until 2009 that these identity types can be used in combination with the univalent universes. In particular, the idea that univalence can be introduced simply by adding an axiom to the existing Martin-L\u00f6f type theory appeared only in 2009.\n Also in 2009, Voevodsky worked out more of the details of a model of type theory in  Kan complexes, and observed that the existence of a universal  Kan fibration could be used to resolve the coherence problems for categorical models of type theory. He also proved, using an idea of A. K. Bousfield, that this universal fibration was univalent: the associated fibration of pairwise homotopy equivalences between the fibers is equivalent to the paths-space fibration of the base.\n To formulate univalence as an axiom Voevodsky found a way to define &#34;equivalences&#34; syntactically that had the important property that the type representing the statement &#34;f is an equivalence&#34; was (under the assumption of function extensionality) (-1)-truncated (i.e. contractible if inhabited). This enabled him to give a  syntactic statement of univalence, generalizing Hofmann and Streicher&#39;s &#34;universe extensionality&#34; to higher dimensions. He was also able to use these definitions of equivalences and contractibility to start developing significant amounts of &#34;synthetic homotopy theory&#34; in the proof assistant  Coq; this formed the basis of the library later called &#34;Foundations&#34; and eventually &#34;UniMath&#34;.  [17]\n Unification of the various threads began in February 2010 with an informal meeting at  Carnegie Mellon University, where Voevodsky presented his model in Kan complexes and his Coq code to a group including Awodey, Warren, Lumsdaine, and  Robert Harper, Dan Licata,  Michael Shulman, and others. This meeting produced the outlines of a proof (by Warren, Lumsdaine, Licata, and Shulman) that every homotopy equivalence is an equivalence (in Voevodsky&#39;s good coherent sense), based on the idea from category theory of improving equivalences to adjoint equivalences. Soon afterwards, Voevodsky proved that the univalence axiom implies function extensionality.\n The next pivotal event was a mini-workshop at the  Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach in March 2011 organized by Steve Awodey, Richard Garner, Per Martin-L\u00f6f, and Vladimir Voevodsky, titled &#34;The homotopy interpretation of constructive type theory&#34;.  [18] As part of a Coq tutorial for this workshop, Andrej Bauer wrote a small Coq library  [19] based on Voevodsky&#39;s ideas (but not actually using any of his code); this eventually became the kernel of the first version of the &#34;HoTT&#34; Coq library  [20] (the first commit of the latter  [21] by Michael Shulman notes &#34;Development based on Andrej Bauer&#39;s files, with many ideas taken from Vladimir Voevodsky&#39;s files&#34;). One of the most important things to come out of the Oberwolfach meeting was the basic idea of higher inductive types, due to Lumsdaine, Shulman, Bauer, and Warren. The participants also formulated a list of important open questions, such as whether the univalence axiom satisfies canonicity (still open, although some special cases have been resolved positively  [22]  [23]), whether the univalence axiom has nonstandard models (since answered positively by Shulman), and how to define (semi)simplicial types (still open in MLTT, although it can be done in Voevodsky&#39;s Homotopy Type System (HTS), a type theory with two equality types).\n Soon after the Oberwolfach workshop, the  Homotopy Type Theory website and blog  [24] was established, and the subject began to be popularized under that name. An idea of some of the important progress during this period can be obtained from the blog history.  [25]\n  The phrase &#34;univalent foundations&#34; is agreed by all to be closely related to homotopy type theory, but not everyone uses it in the same way. It was originally used by Vladimir Voevodsky to refer to his vision of a foundational system for mathematics in which the basic objects are homotopy types, based on a type theory satisfying the univalence axiom, and formalized in a computer proof assistant.  [26]\n As Voevodsky&#39;s work became integrated with the community of other researchers working on homotopy type theory, &#34;univalent foundations&#34; was sometimes used interchangeably with &#34;homotopy type theory&#34;,  [27] and other times to refer only to its use as a foundational system (excluding, for example, the study of model-categorical semantics or computational metatheory).  [28] For instance, the subject of the IAS special year was officially given as &#34;univalent foundations&#34;, although a lot of the work done there focused on semantics and metatheory in addition to foundations. The book produced by participants in the IAS program was titled &#34;Homotopy type theory: Univalent foundations of mathematics&#34;; although this could refer to either usage, since the book only discusses HoTT as a mathematical foundation.  [27]\n   In 2012\u201313 researchers at the  Institute for Advanced Study held &#34;A Special Year on Univalent Foundations of Mathematics&#34;.  [29] The special year brought together researchers in  topology,  computer science,  category theory, and  mathematical logic. The program was organized by  Steve Awodey,  Thierry Coquand and  Vladimir Voevodsky.\n During the program  Peter Aczel, who was one of the participants, initiated a working group which investigated how to do type theory informally but rigorously, in a style that is analogous to ordinary mathematicians doing set theory. After initial experiments it became clear that this was not only possible but highly beneficial, and that a book (the so-called  HoTT Book)  [27]  [30] could and should be written. Many other participants of the project then joined the effort with technical support, writing, proof reading, and offering ideas. Unusually for a mathematics text, it was developed collaboratively and in the open on  GitHub, is released under a  Creative Commons license that allows people to  fork their own version of the book, and is both purchasable in print and downloadable free of charge.  [31]  [32]  [33]\n  More generally, the special year was a catalyst for the development of the entire subject; the HoTT Book was only one, albeit the most visible, result.\n   ACM Computing Reviews listed the book as a notable 2013 publication in the category &#34;mathematics of computing&#34;.  [34]\n  dependent type            x  :  A  \u00a0  \u22a2  \u00a0  B  (  x  )  \u00a0    {\\displaystyle x:A\\ \\vdash \\ B(x)\\ }\n   \u03b1  :      I  d         I  d     A    (  a  ,  b  )    (  p  ,  q  )    {\\displaystyle \\alpha :\\mathrm {Id} _{\\mathrm {Id} _{A}(a,b)}(p,q)}\n  HoTT uses a modified version of the &#34; propositions as types&#34; interpretation of type theory, according to which types can also represent propositions and terms can then represent proofs. In HoTT, however, unlike in standard &#34;propositions as types&#34;, a special role is played by &#39;mere propositions&#39; which, roughly speaking, are those types having at most one term, up to  propositional equality. These are more like conventional logical propositions than are general types, in that they are proof-irrelevant.\n  The fundamental concept of homotopy type theory is the  path. In HoTT, the type            a  =  b    {\\displaystyle a=b}   is the type of all paths from the point            a    {\\displaystyle a}   to the point            b    {\\displaystyle b}  . (Therefore, a proof that a point            a    {\\displaystyle a}   equals a point            b    {\\displaystyle b}   is the same thing as a path from the point            a    {\\displaystyle a}   to the point            b    {\\displaystyle b}  .) For any point            a    {\\displaystyle a}  , there exists a path of type            a  =  a    {\\displaystyle a=a}  , corresponding to the reflexive property of equality. A path of type            a  =  b    {\\displaystyle a=b}   can be inverted, forming a path of type            b  =  a    {\\displaystyle b=a}  , corresponding to the symmetric property of equality. Two paths of type            a  =  b    {\\displaystyle a=b}   resp.            b  =  c    {\\displaystyle b=c}   can be concatenated, forming a path of type            a  =  c    {\\displaystyle a=c}  ; this corresponds to the transitive property of equality.\n Most importantly, given a path            p  :  a  =  b    {\\displaystyle p:a=b}  , and a proof of some property            P  (  a  )    {\\displaystyle P(a)}  , the proof can be &#34;transported&#34; along the path            p    {\\displaystyle p}   to yield a proof of the property            P  (  b  )    {\\displaystyle P(b)}  . (Equivalently stated, an object of type            P  (  a  )    {\\displaystyle P(a)}   can be turned into an object of type            P  (  b  )    {\\displaystyle P(b)}  .) This corresponds to  the substitution property of equality. Here, an important difference between HoTT and classical mathematics comes in. In classical mathematics, once the equality of two values            a    {\\displaystyle a}   and            b    {\\displaystyle b}   has been established,            a    {\\displaystyle a}   and            b    {\\displaystyle b}   may be used interchangeably thereafter, with no regard to any distinction between them. In homotopy type theory, however, there may be multiple different paths            a  =  b    {\\displaystyle a=b}  , and transporting an object along two different paths will yield two different results. Therefore, in homotopy type theory, when applying the substitution property, it is necessary to state which path is being used.\n In general, a &#34;proposition&#34; can have multiple different proofs. (For example, the type of all natural numbers, when considered as a proposition, has every natural number as a proof.) Even if a proposition has only one proof            a    {\\displaystyle a}  , the space of paths            a  =  a    {\\displaystyle a=a}   may be non-trivial in some way. A &#34;mere proposition&#34; is any type which either is empty, or contains only one point with a trivial  path space.\n Note that people write            a  =  b    {\\displaystyle a=b}   for            I    d    A    (  a  ,  b  )    {\\displaystyle Id_{A}(a,b)}  , thereby leaving the type            A    {\\displaystyle A}   of            a  ,  b    {\\displaystyle a,b}   implicit. Do not confuse it with            i    d    A    :  A  \u2192  A    {\\displaystyle id_{A}:A\\to A}  , denoting the identity function on            A    {\\displaystyle A}  .\n  Two types            A    {\\displaystyle A}   and            B    {\\displaystyle B}   belonging to some universe            U    {\\displaystyle U}   are defined as being  equivalent if there exists an  equivalence between them. An equivalence is a function\n  which has both a left inverse and a right inverse, in the sense that for suitably chosen            g    {\\displaystyle g}   and            h    {\\displaystyle h}  , the following types are both inhabited:\n I    d    B  \u2192  B    (  f  \u2218  g  ,  i    d    B    )  ,    {\\displaystyle Id_{B\\rightarrow B}(f\\circ g,id_{B}),}\n I    d    A  \u2192  A    (  h  \u2218  f  ,  i    d    A    )  .    {\\displaystyle Id_{A\\rightarrow A}(h\\circ f,id_{A}).}\n  f  \u2218  g    =    B  \u2192  B    i    d    B    ,    {\\displaystyle f\\circ g=_{B\\rightarrow B}id_{B},}\n h  \u2218  f    =    A  \u2192  A    i    d    A    .    {\\displaystyle h\\circ f=_{A\\rightarrow A}id_{A}.}\n This expresses a general notion of &#34;           f    {\\displaystyle f}   has both a left inverse and right inverse&#34;, using equality types. Note that the invertibility conditions above are equality types in the function types            A  \u2192  A    {\\displaystyle A\\rightarrow A}   and            B  \u2192  B    {\\displaystyle B\\rightarrow B}  . One generally assumes the function extensionality axiom, which ensures that these are equivalent to the following types that express invertibility using the equality on the domain and codomain            A    {\\displaystyle A}   and            B    {\\displaystyle B}  :\n \u03a0    y  :  B    .  \u00a0  I    d    B    (  (  f  \u2218  g  )  (  y  )  ,  i    d    B    (  y  )  )  ,    {\\displaystyle \\Pi _{y:B}.\\ Id_{B}((f\\circ g)(y),id_{B}(y)),}\n \u03a0    x  :  A    .  \u00a0  I    d    A    (  (  h  \u2218  f  )  (  x  )  ,  i    d    A    (  x  )  )  .    {\\displaystyle \\Pi _{x:A}.\\ Id_{A}((h\\circ f)(x),id_{A}(x)).}\n i.e. for all            x  :  A    {\\displaystyle x:A}   and            y  :  B    {\\displaystyle y:B}  ,\n       Having defined functions that are equivalences as above, one can show that there is a canonical way to turn paths to equivalences.In other words, there is a function of the type\n (  A  =  B  )  \u2192  (  A  \u2243  B  )  ,    {\\displaystyle (A=B)\\to (A\\simeq B),}\n which expresses that types            A  ,  B    {\\displaystyle A,B}   that are equal are, in particular, also equivalent.\n  (  A  =  B  )  \u2243  (  A  \u2243  B  )    {\\displaystyle (A=B)\\simeq (A\\simeq B)}\n &#34;In other words, identity is equivalent to equivalence.

Thousands of subscribers depend on LWN for the best news from the Linux and free software communities. If you enjoy this article, please consider  subscribing to LWN. Thank youfor visiting LWN.net!\n There is an ongoing effort to &#34;modernize&#34; the kernel-development process;so far, the focus has been on  providing bettertools that can streamline the usual email-based workflow. But that&#34;email-based&#34; part has proven to be problematic for some potentialcontributors, especially those who might want to simply submit a small bugfix and are not interested in getting set up with that workflow. Theproject-hosting &#34;forge&#34; sites, like GitHub and GitLab, provide a nearlyfrictionless path for these kinds of one-off contributions, but they donot mesh well\u2014at all, really\u2014with most of mainline kernel development.There is some ongoing work that may change all of that, however.\n Konstantin Ryabitsev at the Linux Foundation has been spearheading much of thiswork going back at least as far as his  September\u00a02019draft proposal for better kernel tooling. Those ideas were discussed at the  2019 Kernel Maintainers Summit and at a  meeting at Open Source Summit Europe\u00a02019in October. Throughout, Ryabitsev has been looking at ways to make it easier fornon-email patch submitters; along the way, he has also released the   b4tool for collecting up patches and worked on  patch attestation.\n A recent  postto the kernel workflows mailing list shows some progress toward a bot that can turna GitHub pull request (PR) into a well-formed patch series to send to theproper reviewers and mailing lists. &#34; This would be a one-wayoperation, effectively turning Github into a fancy &#39;git-send-email&#39; replacement.&#34; He also laid out some of thebenefits that this bot could provide both for maintainers and patchsubmitters: submitters would no longer need to navigate their way around git-format-patch, get_maintainer.pl, and git-send-email -- nor would need to have a patch-friendly outgoing mail gateway to properly contribute patches subsystem maintainers can configure whatever CI pre-checks they want before the series is sent to them for review (and we can work on a library of Github actions, so nobody needs to reimplement checkpatch.pl multiple times) the bot should (eventually) be clever enough to automatically track v1..vX on pull request updates, assuming the API makes it straightforward\n He had some questions about whether the bot should be centralized in asingle repository (per forge platform) that would serve as the singlesubmission point, or whether subsystem maintainers would want to configure their ownrepositories. The latter would give maintainers the opportunity to set their owncriteria for checks that would need to pass (e.g.  checkpatch.pl)before the PR was considered valid, but would mean that they might have to rideherd on the repository as well.\n In addition, Ryabitsev wondered when and how PRs would get closed. The botcould potentially monitor the mainline and auto-close PRs once the patch setgets merged, but that won&#39;t be perfect, of course. An easier approach forhim would be &#34; to auto-close the pull request right after it&#39;s sent to the list with a message like &#39;thank you, please monitor your email for the rest of the process&#39;&#34;, but he was unsure if that would be best.\n As might be guessed, reactions from those participating in the thread wereall over the map. While there is a lack of many kinds of diversity withinthe kernel community, opinions on development workflow\u2014opinions, ingeneral, in truth\u2014do not have that problem. Some maintainers have zerointerest in this kind of effort at all. As Christoph Hellwig  put it:&#34; Please opt all subsystems I maintain out of this crap. The lastthing I need is patches from people that can&#39;t deal with a sane workflow.&#34;\n Hellwig&#39;s complaint, which Jiri Kosina  agreedwith, may be more about the expectations of those who use GitHub (andthe like), and less about the possibility of having a web-based interface tokernel development. Dmitry Vyukov  askedwhy Hellwig and Kosina would be unwilling to accept patches from the systemif they cannot really distinguish them from a regular submission. Vyukovsaid that he is currently experiencing a Git email submission problem that heis uninterested in working around, so he can see why others might besimilarly inclined. Meanwhile, though, he sees benefits from thiskind of bot: On the other hand this workflow has the potential to ensure that younever need to remind to run checkpatch.pl, nor spend time on writingcode formatting comments and re-reviewing v2 because code formattingwill be enforced, etc. So I see how this is actually beneficial formaintainers.\n Hellwig is  notopposed to a web-based solution, though he wants nothing to do withGitHub. But Ryabitsev  seemsuninterested in &#34; reimplementing a lot of stuff that we already get &#39;forfree&#39; from Github and other forges&#34;. Both  Mark Brownand  LaurentPinchart suggested that there are mismatches between GitHub-normal practicesand those of the kernel community. Pinchart mentioned the inability tocomment on a patch&#39;s commit message on GitHub as something that generally leadsto poor messages; the platform is training these developers to a certainextent: Developers who have only been exposed to those platforms are very likelyto never have learnt the importance of commit messages, and of propersplit of changes across commits. Those are issues that are inherent tothose platforms and that we will likely need to handle in an automatedway (at least to some extent) or maintainers will become crazy [...]\n But Miguel Ojeda  thinksthat it is really no different from new developers showing up on themailing list with patches. &#34; The same happens in the LKML -- somepeople have sent bad messages, but we correct them and they learn.&#34; He also  notedthat automated checking of patches can help both developers andmaintainers: [...] it is particularly useful to teach newcomers and tosave time for maintainers having to explain things. Even if amaintainer has a set of email templates for the usual things, it takestime vs. not even having to read the email.\n Ojeda is  working on the  Rust for Linux project, which we  looked at backin April; he  saidthat he has also been working on a bot: For Rust for Linux, I have a GitHub bot that reviews PRs and spots theusual mistakes in commit messages (tags, formatting, lkml vs. lorelinks, that sort of thing). It has been very effective so far to teachnewcomers how to follow the kernel development process. I am also extending it to take Acks, Reviewed-by&#39;s, Tested-by&#39;s, etc.,and then performing the merge only if the CI passes (which includesrunning tests under QEMU, code formatting, lints, etc.) after applyingeach patch.\n But Ojeda is taking things in a rather different direction than what Ryabitsev isenvisioning. Ojeda wants to move the main place for patch review and thelike from the mailing lists to GitHub. He is also considering having hisbot pick up patches from the mailing list and turning them into GitHubPRs\u2014the reverse of what Ryabitsev is doing.\n For his part, Ryabitsev  said:&#34; That&#39;s pretty cool, but I&#39;m opposed to this on theologicalgrounds. :)&#34; In particular, he is concerned about the &#34;single pointof failure&#34; problem for the kernel-development infrastructure. If his botis unavailable for any reason, it may be inconvenient for those who use it,but that will not hobble development. He sees GitHub as simply a&#34; developer frontend tool&#34;.\n Somewhat similar to Ojeda&#39;s intentions, Brendan Higgins  hasa tool to pick up patches from a mailinglist (kselftest in this case) and upload them to a  Gerrit instance. He seessome potential synergies between his bot and the one Ryabitsev is working on.Similarly, Drew DeVault  has been workingon the reverse direction, from a mailing list to a project forge, aswell. Patchwork is alongstanding code-review project that also collects up patches from mailing lists topopulate a web application.It would seem that much of the focus is on getting patches out of mailing lists, though, which is not where Ryabitsev is headed.\n While some maintainers want no part of this &#34;GitHub Future&#34;, others areenthusiastic about the possibilities it could bring. Vyukov  thinksthat having a single GitHub repository with multiple branches will helpconsolidate the kernel-development landscape, which is currently fragmentedon subsystem lines. He sees it as an opportunity to apply consistentcoding-style standards; it does not matter which, he said, &#34; as long as it&#39;sconsistent across the project&#34;. It would also allow testingconsistency throughout the tree and the same for the development process: For once: it will be possible to have proper documentation on theprocess (as compared to current per-subsystem rules, which are usuallynot documented again because of low RoI [return on investment] for anything related to asingle subsystem only).\n It is not at all clear that Vyukov&#39;s interest in consistency throughout thetree is shared widely, but there have certainly been complaints along theway about the difficulty of navigating between the different subsystemprocesses and requirements for submissions. There is also interest inmaking things easier for quick, one-off contributions; as Ryabitsev  putit: Our code review process must alsoallow for what is effectively a &#34;report a typo&#34; link. Currently, this isextremely onerous for anyone, as a 15-minute affair suddenly becomes aherculean effort. The goal of this work is to make drive-by patches easierwithout also burying maintainers under a pile of junk submissions.\n Clearly keeping &#34;junk submissions&#34; to a bare minimum is going to beimportant. Linus Torvalds  saidthat he has had to turn off email from GitHub because it is too noisy;people have apparently signed him up as a project member without any kindof opt-in check. Beyond that, any kind of patch submission from PRs wouldneed to have some sanity checks, including size limits, so that PRs like  one pointed out by Ryabitsevdo not end up on the mailing list.\n That kind of PR highlights another problem: repository maintenance. GregKroah-Hartman  saidthat there will be a need to monitor whatever repositories are being usedfor this purpose. It is not a small task: What ever repo you put this on, it&#39;s going to take constant maintenanceto keep it up to date and prune out the PRs that are going to accumulatethere, as well as deal with the obvious spam and abuse issues thatpopular trees always accumulate.\n Torvalds does not want his GitHub tree used for this purpose andKroah-Hartman said the same. However it plays out, someone will have to betasked with keeping the repository tidy, which is &#34; a thankless taskthat will take constant work&#34;. But Ryabitsev is  hopefulthat the Linux Foundation could fund that kind of work if it becomesnecessary.\n In the end, it will likely come down to how seamlessly the GitHub bot fitsin. If maintainers truly cannot really tell the difference in anysubstantive way, it is hard to see many of them rejecting well-formedpatches that fix real problems in their subsystems. That ideal may not bereached right away, however, which might lead to a premature end to theexperiment. It will be interesting to see it all play out over the comingmonths and years.\n         ( Log in to post comments)", "posttime": "2021-06-24 07:42:23", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "github,linux,\u62c9\u5230", "title": "\u5c06github\u62c9\u5230Linux\u5185\u6838\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d ", "title_en": "Pulling GitHub into the Linux kernel process", "transed": 1, "url": "https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/860607/ef7cdf174ccbe54d/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["github", "linux", "\u62c9\u5230"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "00d20856e7333d9861481cdb1112ab31.png", "infoid": 1067863, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5929\u6c14\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u73b0\u5728\u6b63\u5728\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8db3\u591f\u63a5\u8fd1\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u4fe1\u5fc3\u3002\n \u5e95\u7ebf\uff1a\u6211\u4eec\u5373\u5c06\u4f53\u9a8c\u5386\u53f2\u60a0\u4e45\u7684\u533a\u57df\u70ed\u6d6a\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c06\u6253\u7834\u6bcf\u65e5\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u6e29\u5ea6\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002\n \u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u65f6\u673a\u66f4\u52a0\u4e0d\u5bfb\u5e38\u7684\u70ed\u6d6a\uff0c\u6bd4\u8fc7\u53bb\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u6e29\u6696\u65f6\u671f\u90fd\u53d1\u751f\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u4e0d\u5bfb\u5e38\u3002\n \u4f46\u662f\u70ed\u91cf\u4e0d\u4f1a\u662f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u4e00\u4e9b\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u5982\u897f\u5317\u534e\u76db\u987f\u548c\u6d77\u5cb8\uff0c\u5c06\u9003\u8131\u6781\u7aef\u3002\n       \u5728\u6211\u63d0\u4f9bTorrid\u9884\u6d4b\u4e4b\u524d -

Much cooler near the water along the coast and Northwest Washington.\n    The much higher resolution UW WRF model (4-km grid spacing compared to about 9 km for the European Model) driven by the U.S. GFS global model is quite similar, but slightly cooler, with the off-white and white colors show where temperatures are forecast above 100F at 5 PM Saturday.\n    But Saturday is just a &#34;warm up&#34; for the extraordinarily threatening temperatures predicted for Sunday and Monday.\n    Just amazing.\u00a0 From Olympia south, temperatures rise to 105F and more, with Portland, reaching 110F-- just smashing the previous all-time record of 107F.\u00a0 Sea Tac gets to 101F.\u00a0 Above 110F in portions of the Columbia Basin.\u00a0 But it is the west-side temperature extremes that really are really insane, leading to many stations breaking their all-time records.\n     And then there is Monday.\u00a0 And quite honestly, it is hard to believe my eyes.\u00a0 Around 105F at SeaTac--breaking the all-time record of 103F.\u00a0 Around 114F in Portland---7F greater than the previous record.\u00a0 110F in Olympia and peaking around 115 near Richland.\u00a0 Folks....this is unparalleled, dangerous meteorological territory.\n     But these are just single forecasts.\u00a0 What about ensembles of many forecasts?\u00a0 A key tool for determining probabilities and confidence estimates in our forecasts.\n  For Saturday and Sunday, most of the European Center and U.S. ensemble members are on the same page, suggesting we should have confidence in the forecasts.\n  The ensemble average tends to be highly skillful and the European Ensemble mean forecasts for Seattle and Portland are shown below: up to 103F in Seattle and 110 in Portland.\n     Monday is far more uncertain than the weekend....it could be nutty warm and perhaps a minor cool down in the West. Stay tuned for that as we get closer.\n In any case,\u00a0 it is essentially certain that the Willamette Valley and western Washington from Seattle southward will have a historical heatwave, one beyond the experience of many residents.\n An important issue is that the minimum temperatures will not fall below 70F during the coolest periods, making it more difficult to cool homes and apartments. For portions of the heatwave, the dew points will rise into the mid-60s, making it seem more humid than normal.\n In a region where air conditioning is not widespread, this event will be potentially dangerous for the elderly and I can glad the City of Seattle Emergency Management folks are working on cooling centers and other approaches to mitigate the heat.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 07:41:57", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u70ed\u6d6a,heat,\u6e29\u5ea6", "title": "\u5386\u53f2\u70ed\u6d6a\uff0c\u5728\u897f\u5317\u5730\u533a\u7684\u5f55\u97f3\u6e29\u5ea6 ", "title_en": "An Historical Heat Wave with Record-Breaking Temperatures over the Northwest", "transed": 1, "url": "https://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2021/06/an-historical-heat-wave-with-record.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u70ed\u6d6a", "heat", "\u6e29\u5ea6"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "bc76d530f1dba6f42155007141e113d3.jpg", "infoid": 1067862, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5f53\u96c5\u864e\u57282013\u5e74\u4ece\u5bb6\u4e2d\u7981\u6b62\u5de5\u4f5c\u65f6\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u4e2d\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff1a\u5728\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u662f\u81ea\u53d1\u5408\u4f5c\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\n \u201c\u8fd9\u4e00\u5207\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\uff0c\u201dJacqueline Reses\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u96c5\u864e\u6267\u884c\u5458\u5de5\uff0c\u5728\u5458\u5de5\u5907\u5fd8\u5f55\u4e2d\u3002 \u201c\u4e00\u4e9b\u6700\u4f73\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u6765\u81ea\u8d70\u5eca\u548c\u81ea\u52a9\u9910\u5385\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u8bc6\u65b0\u4eba\u548c\u5373\u5174\u56e2\u961f\u4f1a\u8bae\u3002\u201d\n \u4eca\u5929\uff0cReses\u5973\u58eb\u73b0\u5728\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u662f\u6295\u8d44\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u90ae\u653f\u4e4b\u5bb6\u8d44\u672c\u7684\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u73b0\u5728\u4f1a\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5199\u5907\u5fd8\u5f55\u5417\uff1f\u201d\u5979\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u54e6\u8036\u3002\u201d\u5979\u8bf4\uff0c\u5979\u4ecd\u7136\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u5408\u4f5c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u878d\u5408\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u53bb\u5e74\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\n \u7136\u800c\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u8005\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u98ce\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u8001\u677f\u6b63\u5728\u542c\u8d77\u6765\u4e0e2013\u5e74\u96f7\u65af\u5973\u58eb\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u7eb8\u6761\u3002\u201c\u521b\u65b0\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u201d\u82f9\u679c\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98Tim Cook\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5173\u4e8e\u5e16\u5b50 -

It may even hurt innovation, they say, because the demand for doing office work at a prescribed time and place is a big reason that the American workplace has been inhospitable for many people.\n \u201cThat\u2019s led to a lot of the outcomes we see in the modern office environment \u2014 long hours, burnout, the lack of representation \u2014 because that office culture is set up for the advantage of the few, not the many,\u201d said Dan Spaulding, chief people officer at Zillow, a real estate marketplace.\n \u201cThe idea you can only be collaborative face-to-face is a bias,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d ask, how much creativity and innovation have been driven out of the office because you weren\u2019t in the insider group, you weren\u2019t listened to, you didn\u2019t go to the same places as the people in positions of power were gathering?\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-24 07:41:45", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4f1a\u8bae,meetings,\u529e\u516c\u5ba4", "title": "\u5728\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u4f1a\u8bae\u4f1a\u8bae\u63d0\u5347\u521b\u65b0\u5417\uff1f \u6ca1\u6709\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e ", "title_en": "Do chance meetings at the office boost innovation?
