Castle, who was enrolled in pharmacy school in Ohio, said she was “100% certain that I would stay with a small, independent pharmacy and open my pharmacy one day,” Castle told Modern Retail in a phone interview. But while interning at Walmart, she said, “I absolutely fell in love with it.”</p><p>劳伦·城堡（Lauren Castle）在2011年开始在沃尔玛（Walmart）实习时，她认为自己的寿命不会超过几个月。卡斯尔在俄亥俄州的药房学校就读，她说：“她100％肯定我会留在一家小型独立药房并有一天开药房，”卡斯尔在接受电话采访时告诉《现代零售》。但是，在沃尔玛实习期间，她说：“我绝对爱上了它。”</p><p> She was shocked when a brief reflection she wrote about her summer internship experience, which she’d posted on the company’s intranet forum, made it all the way up to corporate executives. They decided to feature her in their company-wide newsletter. She remembered thinking, “Wow, I am one associate out of over 2 million in the entire world, and my story mattered,” she said. “That was the start, basically, for me.”</p><p> 她在公司内部网论坛上发布的关于夏季实习经历的简短回顾使这一过程一直上升到企业主管，她对此感到震惊。他们决定在全公司通讯中介绍她。她记得当时曾想过：“哇，我是全世界200万以上人口中的一员，我的故事很重要，”她说。 “基本上，这就是我的开始。”</p><p> Now Castle is speaking to more than just Walmart employees. She is one of the roughly 500 people enrolled in the company’s Spotlight program, a new initiative that wants to turn Walmart workers into small-scale influencers.</p><p> 现在，Castle不仅在与沃尔玛员工对话。她是该公司Spotlight计划的大约500名参与者之一，该计划是一项新计划，旨在使沃尔玛员工成为小规模的影响者。</p><p>  Spotlight, which the company began testing this fall, remakes Walmart employees into public-facing company advocates. It’s an outgrowth of Walmart’s My Local Social program, which asked volunteer employees to post on behalf of their local stores. Now, under Spotlight, each employee is the brand. Spotlight is designed to showcase a behind-the-scenes look at life at Walmart. On Instagram, Castle  posts  about the grocery delivery services offered through Walmart’s subscription program, Walmart+, or her  advice for student pharmacists .</p><p>  该公司于今年秋天开始测试的Spotlight使沃尔玛的员工重新成为面向公众的公司倡导者。这是沃尔玛的“我的本地社交”计划的产物，该计划要求志愿员工代表他们的本地商店发布信息。现在，在Spotlight下，每个员工都是品牌。 Spotlight旨在展示沃尔玛生活的幕后故事。在Instagram上，Castle发表了有关通过沃尔玛的订阅计划Walmart +提供的杂货送货服务的信息，或她对学生药剂师的建议。</p><p>   Other Spotlight influencers have gravitated to TikTok (a platform Walmart may  become a stakeholder in), which has fast become a new hub for the company. The app is   teeming  with employees jokingly taping their store managers to a pole, giving a “  Walmart cheer ” before work, or participating in a cross-country “  Walmart dance party ” hosted through TikTok’s duet feature.</p><p>   其他Spotlight影响者已将其吸引到TikTok（沃尔玛可能成为其利益相关者的平台）中，该公司已迅速成为该公司的新枢纽。该应用程序充满了员工的玩笑，他们在商店经理面前开玩笑地称赞他们，在工作前给予“沃尔玛欢呼”，或参加由TikTok的二重奏功能主持的越野“沃尔玛舞会”。</p><p> For now, the Spotlight program is still small — but over the next few years, Walmart is looking to expand it to its  nearly 1.5 million  U.S. associates.</p><p> 目前，Spotlight计划仍然很小，但在接下来的几年中，沃尔玛正计划将其扩展到将近150万名美国员工。</p><p>  “Our vision is to grow this into the world’s largest employee-influencer program,” Jeff Zilberman, the vice president of client services at Brand Networks, the contractor that manages Walmart’s My Local Social and Spotlight programs, told Modern Retail in an email. Brand Networks also manages social campaigns for  Samsung, among other companies.  “By giving a voice to its front-line associates, Walmart is humanizing its brand and giving customers authentic, relatable content that they actually want to see and engage with.”</p><p>  管理沃尔玛“我的本地社交和聚光灯”计划的承包商Brand Networks客户服务副总裁Jeff Zilberman表示：“我们的愿景是将其发展成为全球最大的员工影响力计划。” Brand Networks还管理三星等公司的社交活动。 “通过向一线员工发出声音，沃尔玛正在人性化其品牌，并向客户提供他们真正希望看到并与之互动的真实，相关的内容。” </p><p> Walmart has been shy about discussing its extensive employee social media programs, and the company did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But conversations with Walmart employees, interviews with executives familiar with Spotlight and publicly available episodes from Walmart’s   Sparkcast podcast  give a glimpse into how the growing program is trying to turn employees into a social media force to be reckoned with — and might presage a future in which retail workers are tapped to promote products, broadcast store promotions and combat bad press.</p><p>沃尔玛一直不愿讨论其广泛的员工社交媒体计划，并且该公司未回应多个置评请求。但是，与沃尔玛员工的对话，对熟悉Spotlight的高管的采访以及沃尔玛的Sparkcast播客中公开发布的片段让我们瞥见了这一不断发展的计划如何试图将员工转变为不容忽视的社交媒体力量，并且可能预示着未来的发展零售业人员被利用来促销产品，广播商店促销和打击不良新闻。</p><p> Walmart is part of a growing cohort of retailers that have recruited employees to showcase the positive sides of their companies. Dunkin’ is   compensating  four retail employees to post TikToks on the job, and GameStop recently tried to get its employees to participate in dance challenges on the app. Even Amazon has an army of “FC ambassadors” — warehouse workers that are   paid to tweet corporate talking points  about life inside Amazon fulfillment centers.</p><p> 沃尔玛是越来越多的零售商中的一部分，这些零售商已经招聘了员工以展示公司的积极面。邓金（Dunkin）正在补偿四名零售雇员在工作中发布TikToks，而GameStop最近试图让其雇员参加该应用程序中的舞蹈挑战。即使是亚马逊，也有一支由“ FC大使”组成的军队—仓库工人，其工资是用来发布有关亚马逊运营中心内部生活的企业话题的推文。</p><p> Walmart has not formally announced plans to make Spotlight available to a large swath of its workforce, but the company appears to be actively considering it. “We are talking about opening this up to some hourly roles, on the clock,” Zachary Lones, who heads social media marketing at the company,   told  the podcast “Click 2 Bricks” in November. And Zilberman, the Brand Networks employee,   said  on an episode of “Sparkcast” that “we very much want to continue to grow and evolve [the Spotlight program], and one day make it available to all 1.5 million associates.”</p><p> 沃尔玛尚未正式宣布使Spotlight可供其大部分员工使用的计划，但该公司似乎正在积极考虑。该公司社交媒体营销负责人Zachary Lones在11月告诉播客“ Click 2 Bricks”时说：“我们正在谈论每天按小时开放这些角色。” Brand Networks员工Zilberman在“ Sparkcast”一集中表示，“我们非常希望继续发展和发展[Spotlight计划]，有一天将其提供给所有150万员工。”</p><p> The company has framed its employee influencer program as a way to empower workers. “We want their voice, we want them to talk to their community about what’s relevant,” Lones said on “Click 2 Bricks.” But Walmart in particular, which has   only recently  raised employee wages to an average of $14.26 an hour and has   faced accusations  of punishing workers who take sick days, has extra incentive to look good on social media.</p><p> 该公司制定了员工影响力计划，以增强员工能力。 “我们想要他们的声音，我们希望他们与社区讨论相关的内容，” Lones在“ Click 2 Bricks”上说。但尤其是沃尔玛，最近才将员工的工资提高到每小时平均14.26美元，并面临着惩罚要请病假工人的指控，这具有在社交媒体上表现良好的额外动机。</p><p> The makings of Spotlight  Walmart clearly understands the power of social media. Since 2011, every Walmart store in the country — nearly 5,000 — has had its own, localized Facebook page. That program — first called My Facebook, then renamed My Local Social — soon expanded to other social channels, with local Walmart stores popping up on Instagram and TikTok.</p><p> Spotlight Walmart的产品清楚地了解社交媒体的力量。自2011年以来，该国的每家沃尔玛商店（近5,000家）都拥有自己的本地化Facebook页面。该程序最初称为“我的Facebook”，然后重命名为“我的本地社交”，不久又扩展到其他社交渠道，当地的沃尔玛商店在Instagram和TikTok上迅速出现。</p><p> Stores are given general autonomy to post content, and most posts go up before the company can approve them. Lones told “Click 2 Bricks” that there is a moderation team that will vet posts after the fact. He also said that the My Local Social app has an algorithm that “flags keywords and won’t allow things to be published if there’s curse words or something like that.” Only once has the company asked that a post be deleted for being, as he put it, “off brand.”</p><p> 商店具有发布内容的一般自主权，大多数帖子在公司批准之前都会上架。隆斯告诉《 Click 2 Bricks》，有一个审核小组将在事发后审查帖子。他还说，“我的本地社交”应用程序具有一种算法，该算法“标记关键字，并且如果存在咒骂性词语或类似内容，将不允许发布内容。”该公司仅一次要求删除帖子，因为他说这是“品牌外”。</p><p>   Posting on My Local Social is a volunteer gig — although employees can win items like pins or t-shirts. Castle, who was a My Local Social volunteer before she became an influencer with Spotlight, said that while she was a pharmacist in Flint, Michigan, her Walmart store was especially active on social media. That was after news broke about the water crisis in the city. Her store made it a point to talk about all the programs it offered to the community — like lead testing, health fairs, plus foods and vitamins that could offset potential lead poisoning.</p><p>   在“我的本地社交”上发帖是义工，尽管员工可以赢得别针或T恤之类的物品。卡斯尔（Castle）在成为Spotlight的影响者之前是“我的本地社交”志愿者，她说，虽然她是密歇根州弗林特的一名药剂师，但她的沃尔玛商店在社交媒体上尤其活跃。那是在有关城市水危机的消息传出之后。她的商店非常重视谈论它向社区提供的所有计划，例如铅测试，健康展览会，以及可以抵消潜在铅中毒的食品和维生素。 </p><p> Within Walmart, an entire micro-industry has sprouted up around My Local Social. There’s the Sparkcast podcast, hosted by Brand Networks. In Walmart’s corporate intranet, Brand Networks hosts a video series called “Posts that SPARK,” which highlights some of the most successful social posts that year. Walmart also organizes regular speaking events with social media and copywriting experts to teach workers about social media. According to Lones, employees from TikTok recently gave a session.</p><p>在沃尔玛内部，整个微行业在“我的本地社交”周围萌芽。由品牌网络主持的Sparkcast播客。在沃尔玛的公司内部网中，品牌网络主持了一个名为“发散的帖子”的视频系列，重点介绍了当年一些最成功的社交帖子。沃尔玛还与社交媒体和文案写作专家组织定期的演讲活动，以向员工介绍社交媒体。根据Lones的说法，TikTok的员工最近举行了一次会议。</p><p> Within the My Local Social app, there is a ranking system, complete with white, blue, silver and gold badges; they’re recalculated every quarter according to how much reach and engagement each store’s posts get. “People who raise their hand to become social champs end up becoming our next-level leaders,” Lones said on “Clicks 2 Bricks.” “They get promoted faster. They’re getting visibility. They’re happier.”</p><p> 在“我的本地社交”应用程序中，有一个排名系统，其中包括白色，蓝色，银色和金色徽章。他们会根据每个商店的帖子获得多少影响力和参与度，每季度重新计算一次。隆恩斯在“ Clicks 2 Bricks”上说：“举手成为社会冠军的人们最终成为了我们的下层领导人。” “他们的晋升更快。他们越来越知名。他们更快乐。”</p><p> How My Local Social became Spotlight  The new Spotlight program takes the My Local Social project a step further. Instead of having employees post to a Walmart store account, it asks them to talk about the company on their own personal social channels.</p><p> “我的本地社交”如何成为Spotlight的新Spotlight程序使“我的本地社交”项目更进一步。它要求员工在自己的个人社交渠道上谈论公司，而不是让员工发布到Walmart商店帐户。</p><p> Right now, only salaried employees can become Spotlight influencers. The hourly workers who make up the bulk of Walmart’s staff are not yet eligible. Walmart recruited its top-performing My Local Social ambassadors, like Castle, to join the program this fall.</p><p> 目前，只有受薪员工才能成为Spotlight影响者。占沃尔玛员工大部分的时薪工人还没有资格。沃尔玛（Walmart）招募了表现最出色的“我的本地社交”大使，例如Castle，今年秋天加入了该计划。</p><p> Spotlight, which has its own dedicated app, runs themed “campaigns,” built around a series of question prompts, to inspire employee posts. Most campaigns are centered on timed events like Thanksgiving or Black Friday, according to Castle. The Spotlight app asks questions like, “What do you like to cook on Thanksgiving?” Others are dance challenges — on TikTok, Walmart recently introduced an employee-created song and dance, the   #WalmartHolidayShuffle . On their profiles in the app, Spotlight influencers can select certain skills, personality traits, or hobbies — running the gamut from “veteran” to “singing/rapping” to “makeup” to “gardening” — so that Walmart can recommend campaigns for them specifically.</p><p> Spotlight拥有自己的专用应用程序，它运行围绕一系列问题提示的主题“活动”，以激发员工的职位。据卡斯尔称，大多数活动都集中在诸如感恩节或黑色星期五之类的定时活动上。 Spotlight应用程序会询问诸如“您想在感恩节做饭吗？”之类的问题。其他挑战是舞蹈挑战-沃尔玛（Walmart）在TikTok上最近推出了员工创作的歌舞#WalmartHolidayShuffle。在应用程序的个人资料中，Spotlight影响者可以选择某些技能，性格特征或兴趣爱好-从“老将”到“唱歌/说唱”再到“化妆”再到“园艺”到整个范围，以便沃尔玛为他们推荐广告系列特别。</p><p> Ryan Orlick, another Spotlight influencer who started out posting through My Local Social, told Modern Retail that Walmart’s social media strategy is especially good for recruiting. Orlick remembered a video he posted two years back, recorded from the paint aisle in a Walmart store, talking about new jobs available at Walmart. It got a lot of engagement — and a rush of applications. “It was this aha moment,” said Orlick said in a phone interview. The draw for people, he said, is the local connection. “People knew who I was. They stop and pay attention because, oh, I know that face,” he said. “It’s not a corporate campaign promoting our hiring or a product or service.”</p><p> 另一位开始通过“我的本地社交网站”发布的Spotlight影响者Ryan Orlick告诉《现代零售》，沃尔玛的社交媒体策略特别适合招聘。 Orlick记得他两年前发布的一段视频，该视频是在沃尔玛商店的油漆过道中录制的，谈论的是沃尔玛的新工作。它参与了很多工作，而且申请也很匆忙。 “正是这个时刻，”奥尔里克在电话采访中说。他说，吸引人们的是本地联系。人们知道我是谁。他们停下来注意，因为，哦，我知道那张脸，”他说。 “这不是宣传我们的招聘或产品或服务的公司宣传活动。”</p><p> Orlick, who now oversees digital operations for 11 Walmart stores in Michigan, said that social media was instrumental to his rise in the company. “I was able to use the My Local Social program to put myself in front of my boss’s boss’s boss,” he said. “It helped me get noticed, and start building those relationships.”</p><p> Orlick现在负责密歇根州11家沃尔玛商店的数字运营，他说社交媒体对他在公司的崛起起了重要作用。他说：“我能够使用“我的本地社交”程序将自己置于老板的老板的面前。” “它帮助我得到关注，并开始建立这种关系。” </p><p> Orlick emphasized that Spotlight is opt-in. But even as an optional program, Walmart’s corporate executives clearly see a lot of value in expanding Spotlight. Orlick said he didn’t realize how important Spotlight was going to be until recently, when he started getting asked to participate in two or three conference calls about Spotlight per week. “That’s when it kind of clicked that this is a program that the company is invested in, and they want it to grow,” he said.</p><p>Orlick强调选择加入Spotlight。但是，即使作为一项可选计划，沃尔玛的企业高管也清楚地看到了扩展Spotlight的巨大价值。 Orlick说直到最近，他才开始被要求参加有关Spotlight的每周两三个电话会议，直到最近他才意识到Spotlight的重要性。他说：“当时，这是该公司投资的一项计划，他们希望它能够发展。”</p><p> Compensating engagement  While personal content makes up the bulk of Spotlight posts, brand sponsorships are on the rise. In November, Walmart introduced a partnership with action figure brand Funko: Spotlight influencers were asked to make posts with Funko products, according to Orlick, and the top 10 posts (based on an algorithm that measures engagement) received $200 each in cash. Other challenges are higher paid. For a new challenge that Walmart posted with the hoverboard brand Hover-1, the top prize is $1,000.</p><p> 补偿参与虽然个人内容占Spotlight帖子的大部分，但品牌赞助正在增加。去年11月，沃尔玛与动作玩偶品牌Funko建立了合作关系：根据Orlick的说法，要求聚光灯影响者发表Funko产品的帖子，排名前10位的帖子（基于衡量参与度的算法）每人获得200美元现金。其他挑战是高薪。对于沃尔玛与悬浮滑板品牌Hover-1发布的新挑战，最高奖金为1,000美元。</p><p> Castle said that these rewards are a step toward Walmart developing a “true influencer program.” “A lot of us, we started off with our own personal profiles just because we were genuinely excited about it and like to share what we do in our job,” she said. “And so now it’s actually kind of coming full circle where we have this program to help compensate for that, which is just really exciting.”</p><p> 卡斯尔说，这些奖励是沃尔玛开发“真正的影响者计划”的一步。她说：“我们中的很多人，我们刚开始拥有自己的个人资料，只是因为我们对此感到非常兴奋，并喜欢分享我们在工作中所做的事情。” “所以现在实际上已经到了一个完整的圈子，我们有了这个程序来弥补这一点，这真的很令人兴奋。”</p><p> Introducing financial rewards adds new questions for the employee influencing field. Patrick Thelen, a  public relations professor at San Diego State University  who studies employee advocacy, worries about the larger trend that programs like this might signal — especially if, as Walmart has discussed, the program becomes available on a much more widespread basis.</p><p> 引入经济奖励会给员工影响领域增加新的问题。圣地亚哥州立大学的公共关系学教授帕特里克·塞伦（Patrick Thelen）研究员工的倡导，他担心这样的程序可能会发出更大的趋势，尤其是如沃尔玛所讨论的那样，该程序在更广泛的范围内可用。</p><p> “Some employees are more active on social media than others,” Thelen said. Referring to paying employees for successful social posts, he said, “is it fair to offer that as an incentive? I don’t know.” It becomes even more complex if executives say employees with good social chops are most likely to get promoted. “Why should your ‘influencer skills’ have anything to do with getting a promotion?”</p><p> 塞伦说：“有些员工在社交媒体上比其他员工更活跃。”他谈到为成功的社交职位支付薪水时，“提供激励措施是否公平？我不知道。”如果高管们说具有良好社交能力的员工最有可能得到晋升，那就变得更加复杂。 “为什么您的“影响者技能”与晋升有什么关系？”</p><p> Even though the program is voluntary, he worried that it could set a troubling precedent. “I think that’s dangerous territory, and I would stay away from that if I were advising the organizations,” Thelen said.</p><p> 尽管该计划是自愿的，但他担心该计划可能会开创令人不安的先例。塞伦说：“我认为那是危险的领域，如果我为这些组织提供建议，我将远离这一领域。”</p><p> On the flip side, promoting companies on social media is a form of labor, and in the same way that regular influencers will receive compensation for talking about a brand, other experts feel that employees should be offered the same benefit. “It seems like there are a lot of companies out there right now who are like, ‘we now expect you to post in your spare time,’ and not treating that as real labor that deserves payment,” said Alexandra J. Roberts, a law professor at the University of New Hampshire who studies social media disclosures. “I think [saying] ‘we’re going to give you a color-coded ranking and tell you that you’re great’ is pretty weak compared to, ‘We’re going to pay you for your work.’”</p><p> 另一方面，在社交媒体上推广公司是一种劳动，就像普通影响者因谈论品牌而获得报酬一样，其他专家也认为应该为员工提供同样的利益。 “似乎现在有很多公司，'我们现在希望您在业余时间里发帖'，而不是将其视为应得的实际劳动，”亚历山德拉·J·罗伯茨（Alexandra J. Roberts）说：新罕布什尔大学法学教授，研究社交媒体披露。 “我认为[说]“我们将为您提供以颜色区分的排名，并告诉您您很棒”，相比之下，“我们将为您的工作付费”。 </p><p> The other thorny question that Spotlight raises is centered on disclosure rules. Although Walmart rarely publicly discusses its employee influencer programs, the company does note that workers are behind these posts. In order for a post to be counted inside the Spotlight app, it has to include the hashtag #IWorkForWalmart — the employee influencer equivalent of appending a post with #ad.</p><p>Spotlight提出的另一个棘手问题是信息披露规则。尽管沃尔玛很少公开讨论其员工影响力计划，但该公司确实指出，这些职位背后是工人。为了使帖子可以在Spotlight应用程序内进行计数，它必须包含#IWorkForWalmart主题标签—相当于员工的影响力，相当于将帖子附加#ad。</p><p> It gets a bit murkier when talking about brand-sponsored campaigns. The Funko collaboration, for instance, asked employees to use the hashtag #FunkoPop in addition to #IWorkForWalmart in every post. Employees made clear that they were Walmart workers — but less certain is whether, since the campaign was sponsored by Funko, an extra disclosure is needed.</p><p> 在谈论品牌赞助的广告系列时，它会变得更加模糊。例如，与Funko合作时，要求员工在每个帖子中除#IWorkForWalmart外还使用#FunkoPop标签。员工明确表示他们是沃尔玛员工-但不确定性是否存在，因为该活动由Funko赞助，是否需要额外披露。</p><p> “ I haven’t seen much precedent on this question,” said  Roberts.  “ If Walmart and others continue to expand these practices, maybe we’ll hear from the FTC with additional guidance soon.” The bottom line, she said, revolves around the question, “would having the information affect how consumers understand the post or endorsement? If it would, they should have it. ”</p><p> 罗伯茨说：“我在这个问题上还没有看到很多先例。” “如果沃尔玛和其他公司继续扩大这些做法，也许我们会很快收到来自联邦贸易委员会的消息，并提供其他指导。”她说，最重要的是围绕着这个问题：“信息是否会影响消费者如何理解帖子或认可？如果可以的话，他们应该拥有它。 ”</p><p> A growing retail phenomenon  Right now, the companies with employee influencers are a small but fast-growing pool, running the gamut from Topgolf to Huawei. Scrolling through TikTok, it’s increasingly difficult to gauge which posts are company-ordained and which are truly organic — especially as some actually organic employees posts have   resulted in firings . “There are many companies using leaderboards like the ones Walmart is using, where employees can compete and get monetary rewards, swag, prizes,” said Thelen. “It’s a practice that seems to be increasingly common.”</p><p> 零售现象日益严重目前，拥有员工影响力的公司虽然规模很小，但增长迅速，从Topgolf到华为一应俱全。滚动浏览TikTok，越来越难以确定哪些职位是公司指定的，哪些职位是真正的有机的-尤其是因为某些实际上是有机的员工职位已导致解雇。 Thelen说：“有许多公司使用沃尔玛所使用的排行榜，员工可以竞争并获得金钱奖励，赃物和奖品。” “这种做法似乎越来越普遍。”</p><p> But there are pitfalls to growing these programs. Employee social media posts work, Thelen said, when they’re actually organic. If soon every company is incentivizing every employee to post about their workplaces, consumers will get smart, and “then those programs will lose value,” he said.</p><p> 但是，发展这些计划存在陷阱。 Thelen说，员工社交媒体上的帖子实际上是有机的。他说，如果每家公司都尽快激励每位员工发布有关其工作场所的信息，那么消费者将变得精明，“那么这些程序将失去价值”。</p><p>   T he program could easily become an important publication relations tool. Should something bad happen, a Spotlight campaign could in theory ask employees to shed a more favorable light on the company. It’s much harder to criticize a company when faced with an employee — even if they aren’t representative of the majority of workers — saying they love their job. The   description  of the Spotlight app on Google Play alludes to its use for “brand reputation,” writing that “challenges may be about products, services, brand reputation, etc.”</p><p>   该程序很容易成为重要的发布关系工具。如果发生坏事，理论上，Spotlight活动可以要求员工对公司给予更有利的帮助。当面对员工时，要批评一家公司就更难了，即使他们并不能代表大多数员工，也要说他们喜欢自己的工作。 Google Play上Spotlight应用的描述暗示了其用于“品牌声誉”的用法，写道“挑战可能与产品，服务，品牌声誉等有关”。</p><p> None of the influencers Modern Retail spoke to said they were explicitly asked to say positive things about the company, and Orlick emphasized that while Walmart does have question prompts in the Spotlight app, “never is there a ‘hey, we want you to talk about X,’” he said.</p><p> Modern Retail的影响者中没有一个说过要他们明确表达对公司的正面评价，Orlick强调，尽管沃尔玛在Spotlight应用程序中确实有问题提示，“从来没有，'嘿，我们希望您谈论X，'”他说。 </p><p> Jaywant Singh, a marketing professor at the University of Southampton, has   studied  how brands use influencers for corporate PR. He pointed to some cases of this happening, like McDonald’s partnering with food influencers in India after backlash to the company’s Dosa Masala burger. But Singh said examples of companies using influencers to fend off critics are “far and few between.”</p><p>南安普敦大学市场营销学教授Jaywant Singh研究了品牌如何使用影响者进行企业公关。他指出了发生这种情况的一些情况，例如麦当劳（McDonald）与印度的食品影响者合作，对该公司的Dosa Masala汉堡表示强烈反对。但是辛格说，有一些公司利用有影响力的人来抵制批评家的例子“很少”。</p><p> For now, Spotlight’s future as a Walmart-led PR tool remains to be seen — as does the overall phenomenon’s impact. But if employee influencing does catch on to a much broader extent, it could have implications for the fundamental experience of working in retail. Thelen worries that, as employee influencing becomes more mainstream, social media might increasingly guide hiring decisions — even for people in jobs outside of PR and media. “I’m scared of the fact that, will you be looking at how many followers people have on social media before you hire anyone for any type of job? Is that what we want?” said Thelen.</p><p> 目前，聚光灯作为沃尔玛主导的PR工具的未来还有待观察-整体现象的影响也是如此。但是，如果员工影响力的确扩大到更大范围，则可能会对零售业的基本经验产生影响。 Thelen担心，随着员工影响力日益成为主流，社交媒体可能会越来越多地指导招聘决策-即使对于公关和媒体以外的工作人员也是如此。 “我很害怕这样一个事实，在您雇用任何人从事任何类型的工作之前，您是否会查看人们在社交媒体上拥有多少关注者？那就是我们想要的吗？”塞伦说。</p><p> Castle, however, continues to evangelize the program. She described groups on the company’s intranet server where Spotlight influencers point out especially social-media-adept Walmart workers. “It’s like, hey, I saw this associate who’s doing some really cool things on their social channels,” she said. “It’s just sort of that grassroots effort to try and get more people involved and participating.”</p><p> 但是，Castle继续宣传该计划。她在公司的Intranet服务器上描述了小组，Spotlight的影响者特别指出了社交媒体领域的沃尔玛员工。她说：“就像，嘿，我看到这位同事正在他们的社交渠道上做一些非常酷的事情。” “这只是尝试让更多人参与并参与的基层工作。”</p><p> Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated that Castle graduated from pharmacy school in 2011. It has been updated to reflect that she was interning while still enrolled.</p><p> 更正：这个故事的早期版本错失了Castle在2011年从药房毕业的事实。该信息已更新，以反映出她仍在就读期间正在实习。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.modernretail.co/retailers/a-true-influencer-program-inside-walmarts-growing-army-of-employee-tiktokers/">https://www.modernretail.co/retailers/a-true-influencer-program-inside-walmarts-growing-army-of-employee-tiktokers/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/沃尔玛/">#沃尔玛</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/walmart/">#walmart</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/员工/">#员工</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
