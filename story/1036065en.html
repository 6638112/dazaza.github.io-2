Next, she had to prove it. Fortunately for Tedia, she had eyewitnesses.</p><p>1370年，Tedia Lambhird向John Saundirson申请离婚，声称她的丈夫无能为力。接下来，她必须证明这一点。对于Tedia来说幸运的是，她有目击者。</p><p> One key witness, Thomas son of Stephen, testified in church court that he had seen the couple unsuccessfully attempting to have sex in John’s father’s barn before 9 o’clock one springtime morning. In spite of the fact that John and Tedia were “applying themselves with zeal to the work of carnal intercourse,” Thomas reported that he saw “John’s rod was lowered and in no way rising or becoming erect.” Furthermore, Thomas claimed that John’s brother also witnessed the failed sexual encounter, adding that the brother stroked John’s penis with his hand in order to see if he could help.</p><p> 一位主要证人，斯蒂芬的儿子托马斯（Thomas）在教堂法庭上作证说，他看到这对夫妇在一个春天的早晨9点之前在约翰父亲的谷仓里尝试性交失败。尽管约翰和泰迪亚“热衷于肉体性交”，但托马斯报告说，他看到“约翰的鱼竿下降了，丝毫没有上升或勃起。”此外，托马斯声称约翰的兄弟也目睹了失败的性交，并补充说，兄弟用手抚摸着约翰的阴茎，看他是否可以帮忙。</p><p> So to summarize: John Saundirson not only tried (and failed) to have early-morning barn-sex with his wife before an audience of two men but also received ineffective manual penis stimulation from his own brother. Thanks to Thomas’s devastating testimony, Tedia won her case.</p><p> 综上所述：约翰·桑迪森（John Saundirson）不仅试图（失败了）与妻子在两个男人面前进行早间性行为，而且还从他自己的兄弟那里得到了无效的人工阴茎刺激。多亏了托马斯（Thomas）的毁灭性证词，泰迪亚（Tedia）胜诉。</p><p> Outrageous as it seems, the case of Lambhird v. Saundirson is one of multiple late medieval English annulment cases on record that focus on the question of impotence — which is still grounds for divorce in plenty of places today, including parts of the United States.</p><p> Lambhird诉Saundirson案似乎令人发指，是有记录的多个中世纪晚期英国废除婚姻案件之一，重点关注阳ot问题-今天仍然是许多地方（包括美国部分地区）离婚的理由。</p><p> In the Middle Ages, impotence was one of the few grounds on which a woman could successfully obtain a divorce, since the Catholic Church believed that spouses owed the “marital debt” of sex to one another. But in order to confirm the husband’s impotence and to ensure that the woman wasn’t simply making false claims to escape the sacrament of marriage — after all, women were thought to be inherently less trustworthy and more prone to lying than men — the courts needed witnesses.</p><p> 在中世纪，阳imp是妇女能够成功离婚的少数理由之一，因为天主教会认为，配偶彼此之间存在性的“婚姻债务”。但是，为了确认丈夫的无能，并确保妇女不是简单地提出虚假主张以逃避婚姻的圣礼，毕竟，妇女被认为天生比男人更不可信，更容易撒谎，法院需要目击者。</p><p> Sometimes these “witnesses” were a little more like investigators. Medieval historian Bronach Kane examines some of these cases in  Impotence and Virginity in the Late Medieval Ecclesiastical Court of York, noting how physical inspections of genitals and breasts by the defendant’s friends and neighbors were used to determine impotence, virginity and pregnancy in church court cases.</p><p> 有时这些“证人”更像是调查员。中世纪历史学家布罗纳赫·凯恩（Bronach Kane）在约克中世纪晚期天主教法院对阳Imp和处女症中的其中一些案件进行了检查，指出被告人的朋友和邻居对生殖器和乳房的身体检查是如何用于确定教堂法庭案件中阳imp，童贞和怀孕的。</p><p> Often the witnesses in impotency cases were women, either married female acquaintances, widows, or local sex workers. They might be tasked by the court with inspecting the man’s genital equipment, or they might expose their breasts and genitals to the allegedly impotent man, give him ale and tasty snacks, kiss him, and rub his penis in a warm room to see whether he became aroused. But other times, these witnesses were men who looked on as the husband in question tried to have sex, or even lent a hand and stroked his penis themselves, reporting their findings to the court.</p><p> 在阳ot案件中的证人常常是妇女，她们是已婚的女性熟人，寡妇或当地的性工作者。法院可能会责令他们检查该男子的生殖器，也可能将他们的乳房和生殖器暴露于据称无能的男子，给他啤酒和美味的零食，亲吻他，并在温暖的房间里摩擦他的阴茎，看看他是否引起了。但有时，这些目击者是男人，她们是在所讨论的丈夫试图进行性行为，甚至伸手抚摸自己的阴茎时向法庭报告他们的发现。</p><p>  Impotence was a pressing concern for men and women in late medieval England. Multiple poems from the time feature women gathering in groups over copious amounts of alcohol and complaining about their impotent husbands, comparing their flaccid penises to maggots, snails and bumblebees. Other poems are voiced by the men themselves, who mourn their impotence and offer advice to others about preserving their virility. “All ye lovers take heed of me, for I was once as lusty as ye,” laments one poet.</p><p>在中世纪晚期的英格兰，阳是男人和女人的紧迫问题。当时的多首诗以女性聚集在一起喝大量的酒精为生，抱怨她们无能为力的丈夫，将松弛的阴茎与，蜗牛和大黄蜂进行比较。男人们也表达了其他诗歌，他们哀悼自己的无能，并为他人提供了关于保持活力的建议。一位诗人感叹道：“你们所有的恋人都注意我，因为我曾经和你们一样欲望。”</p><p> Guy de Chauliac, an influential physician and noted medical authority of the time, recommended that impotence be treated with spices, concoctions of spiced and sweetened wine, hot oils, and vigorous penile rubbing in front of a fire made of woodchips. He noted that male physicians were often commissioned as expert witnesses in divorce cases and suggested that they “examine the generative members” of the accused man carefully before ordering him to go to bed with a sexually experienced woman and interviewing her afterward.</p><p> 盖伊·德·乔利亚克（Guy de Chauliac）是一位颇具影响力的医生，并曾当过著名的医学权威，他建议用香料，加香料的加糖酒，热油和强烈的阴茎摩擦在木屑制成的火堆上治疗阳imp。他指出，在离婚案件中，通常聘请男医生作为专家证人，并建议他们在命令他与一个有性经验的妇女上床并随后与她面谈之前，仔细“检查”被告男子的生殖成员。</p><p>  When Katherine Barlay filed to annul her marriage to William Barton due to impotence in 1433, more than a dozen people gave testimonies about William’s penis after examining it on numerous occasions. After three men and several women inspected William at a tavern called the Swan, one Robert Lincoln testified that William placed his “manly rod” in his hand; Lincoln described it as “long and large enough to have carnal coupling with any woman alive.” On another evening, three men examined William’s “secret manly members” at a friend’s house. They also gave his penis rave reviews, often comparing it to their own. One testified that he himself had fathered 10 children and that “William’s was better in length and girth than [my] rod ever was.” Another reported that William Barton had “large and fit testicles and other signs of virility … just as [I myself] ever had or better.” Getting into more specific measurements, two witnesses testified that Barton’s penis was “two handfuls” long when erect. (Measuring penis length by the “handful” was not uncommon during this time: One poem features a man who boasts that his penis is “a handful and half” in length.)</p><p>  当凯瑟琳·巴雷（Katherine Barlay）在1433年因阳imp而宣布与威廉·巴顿（William Barton）结婚后，十几个人在多次检查后对威廉的阴茎作了证词。在三名男子和几名妇女在名为“天鹅”的小酒馆里检查威廉之后，一个罗伯特·林肯作证说威廉将他的“男子气概”放在他手中。林肯将其描述为“足够长，足以与任何活着的女人进行肉体耦合。”在另一个晚上，三名男子在一个朋友家中检查了威廉的“男子气概的秘密成员”。他们还给他的阴茎好评如潮，经常将其与自己的比较。一个人作证说，他本人已经生了10个孩子，而且“威廉的长度和周长比[我]的钓竿要好。”另一位报道说，威廉·巴顿“睾丸较大且健壮，并且有其他生殖力迹象……就像[我本人]曾经有过或更好。”进行更具体的测量时，两名证人作证说，巴顿的阴茎勃起时“很短”。 （在这段时间内用“少数”测量阴茎的长度并不少见：一首诗中有一个人称自己的阴茎长度为“少数一半”。）</p><p> Several women also inspected William Barton’s genitalia, including one who agreed that William’s “rod and testicles appeared sufficient to serve and please any honest woman.” But some women had less glowing comments about William’s genitalia, supporting his wife’s accusation of impotence. Robert Lincoln, however, countered that these particular women had handled William’s penis too roughly and with such cold hands that “on account of shame, his rod retracted itself into William’s body.”</p><p> 几位妇女还检查了威廉·巴顿的生殖器，其中一位同意威廉的“杆和睾丸看起来足以服务并​​取悦任何诚实的妇女”。但是一些妇女对威廉的生殖器的评论较少，这支持了妻子对阳imp的指控。然而，罗伯特·林肯（Robert Lincoln）则反驳说，这些特殊的女人过分粗暴地握着威廉姆斯的阴茎，用冰冷的双手“由于羞愧，他的杖缩回了威廉姆斯的身体”。</p><p> The true state of William’s penis even divided one married couple: While Katherine Mycholson claimed that “his rod was of no value,” her husband, John, testified that this assessment was “contrary to his sight and knowledge” and promised to make his wife confess her penile “perjury” to their priest as soon as possible. (As with many of these medieval cases, there is unfortunately no record of who won the case of Barlay v. Barton.)</p><p> 威廉姆斯的阴茎的真实状况甚至将一对已婚夫妇分开：当凯瑟琳·迈克尔森（Katherine Mycholson）声称“他的鱼竿毫无价值”时，她的丈夫约翰（John）作证说，这种评估“与他的见识和知识背道而驰”，并答应让他的妻子尽快向他们的牧师承认她的阴茎“伪证”。 （不幸的是，与许多中世纪案件一样，没有关于谁赢得Barlay诉Barton案的记录。）</p><p>  In 1561 or 1562, when Margaret Alatt filed for divorce from Richard Pierson on the grounds of impotence, Richard admitted that the couple had never had sex, but he was full of elaborate explanations. He testified that he had wanted to consummate the marriage on their wedding night, but “by chance hurt himself before he could have his pleasure.” He decided to abstain from sex for the next eight weeks in order to see if he might heal on his own.</p><p>  1561年或1562年，玛格丽特·阿拉特（Margaret Alatt）以阳imp为由向理查德·皮尔森（Richard Pierson）申请离婚时，理查德承认这对夫妻从未发生过性关系，但他充满了详尽的解释。他作证说，他想在他们的新婚之夜圆满完成婚姻，但是“偶然地伤害了自己，使他无法享乐。”他决定在接下来的八周内放弃性生活，以了解自己是否可以自行治愈。</p><p> In the meantime, “before he could be perfectly healed,” Margaret told everyone that Richard lacked “members that which a man should have.” When she asked him to have sex with her, Richard answered that “he was not well, but he thought he should amend in continuance of time.” Richard then visited a doctor, who gave him a special medicinal drink — a sort of liquid Viagra — that he drank every morning and evening for nine days until he “was cured, and perceived himself lusty.” But by then, he says, he had no desire to sleep with Margaret. At the trial, he insisted that he couldn’t possibly be impotent because he’d had sex with another woman (whom he conveniently failed to name) and was sure that her child was his. When the church court asked him why he’d cheated on his wife, he explained that “he would never have done so, but that she had raised such a slander” — by publicizing her accusations of impotence — that he’d had no choice.</p><p> 同时，“在他被完美治愈之前，”玛格丽特告诉所有人理查德缺乏“成员们男人应该拥有的东西。”当她要求他与她发生性关系时，理查德回答说：“他不舒服，但他认为他应该在时间上继续进行修正。”理查德随后拜访了一位医生，他给他提供了一种特殊的药用饮料-一种液体伟哥-他每天早上和晚上都喝酒九天，直到他“被治愈，并感觉到自己有色泽”。但他说，那时他已经不想和玛格丽特睡了。在庭审中，他坚持认为自己不可能做无能为力，因为他曾与另一名妇女发生性关系（但他不愿透露姓名），并确定她的孩子就是他的孩子。当教堂法院问他为什么要对妻子作弊时，他解释说“他永远不会这样做，但她提出了这样的诽谤”-通过宣传她对阳imp的指控-他别无选择。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://narratively.com/the-distinguished-medieval-penis-investigators/">https://narratively.com/the-distinguished-medieval-penis-investigators/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/中世纪/">#中世纪</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/medieval/">#medieval</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/阴茎/">#阴茎</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
