Reffkin is so passionate about inspiring others from nontraditional backgrounds to pursue their dreams that he wrote   a book  about it.</p><p> 本周，我赶上了整个其他话题的雷弗金：他对创业的道路，作为一个被一个派在父亲所死无家可归的虐待的单身母亲抚养的孩子。 Reffkin非常热衷于激发来自非传统背景的人，以追求他们梦想他写了一本关于它的梦想。</p><p>  In our discussion, Reffkin shared what he believes are the secrets to his success (hint: one of them involves lots of listening) and his advice for his young entrepreneurs, especially those from non-privileged backgrounds.</p><p>  在我们的讨论中，Reffkin分享了他认为是他成功的秘诀（提示：其中一个涉及大量听力）以及他对他年轻企业家的建议，特别是那些来自非特权背景的建议。</p><p>  TC: As the mother of a teen who is already trying to start his own business, I’m intrigued by your DJing as a teenager. What finally got you motivated to care about school and how did you manage to graduate in such a short amount of time?</p><p>  TC：作为一个已经试图开始自己的事业的青少年的母亲，我是你的djing作为少年的兴趣。终于让你有动力关心学校，你是如何在这么短的时间内毕业的？</p><p> Reffkin: Well, I think your son might just be on the right track! Please give him a word of encouragement from me, from one entrepreneur to another.</p><p> Reffkin：嗯，我认为你的儿子可能只是在正确的轨道上！请给他一个鼓励我的一个鼓励，从一个企业家到另一个企业家。</p><p> My mom says that a lot of other parents thought she was crazy for letting me launch my DJ business. But starting a successful DJ business in high school helped me learn about myself and my passion for entrepreneurship — and it ultimately helped me get into Columbia, forming the core of both my personal statement and the relationships I built with several members of the admissions team.</p><p> 我妈妈说，很多其他父母认为她疯了让我发动我的DJ业务。但是，在高中开始成功的DJ业务帮助了我对自己的热情以及我对创业的热情 - 最终帮助我进入了哥伦比亚，形成了我个人陈述的核心和我与招生团队的几名成员建立的关系。</p><p> I believe the first step is always to dream big. For me, my big dreams for my college future started on a trip to New York City. I toured Columbia and fell in love with it, but I knew it was going to be hard for me to get in. In fact, my high school guidance counselor said, “Don’t even apply. It wouldn’t be worth your time and money on the application fee.” In that moment, my desire to go to Columbia went from strong to absolute, because suddenly it felt like it was about something larger than myself — not just where I went to school, but about a broader struggle for opportunity for people like me. So I poured myself into my SAT prep to show that even though I had a C average, I had what it took to keep up at a top school. And thankfully, it paid off.</p><p> 我相信第一步总是梦想大。对我来说，我的大学未来的大梦想开始前往纽约市。我在哥伦比亚巡回了哥伦比亚，爱上了它，但我知道我会很难进入。事实上，我的高中指导顾问说：“甚至普遍存在。在申请费上不值得您的时间和金钱。“在那一刻，我渴望去哥伦比亚的渴望到绝对，因为突然间，它觉得它是关于我更大的东西 - 不仅仅是我去上学的东西，而是对像我这样的人的机会挣扎。所以我把自己倒入了我的SAT准备，表明即使我有一个平均值，我也有什么需要在一个顶级学校努力。谢天谢地，它得到了报酬。 </p><p> In high school and college, I was a C-student in part because I didn’t see how studying calculus or Western Civilization related to my life or my dreams. I knew that excelling in school wasn’t going to be the way I was going to distinguish myself in the world. At the same time, I was energized by my entrepreneurial efforts and my summer internships. I moved as quickly as I could to get through school and have my real life begin, because the real world made so much more sense to me.</p><p>在高中和学院，我是一名C-学生，因为我没有看到如何学习与我的生命或梦想相关的微积分或西方文明。我知道学校的优秀表现不会成为我将在世界上区分自己的方式。与此同时，我被我的企业家努力和暑期实习充满活力。我尽快搬到学校，让我的真实生活开始，因为现实世界对我来说更有意义。</p><p> TC: How do you think being raised by a single mother without privilege helped shape you as a man, and entrepreneur? How would you say being a person of color impact your path?</p><p> TC：你认为没有特权的单身母亲抚养人如何帮助塑造你作为一个男人，而企业家？你怎么说成为一个颜色的人会影响你的道路？</p><p> Reffkin: Growing up, it was just me and my mom. She’s an Israeli immigrant, disowned by her parents because I was Black. My father abandoned us and died, homeless, when I was young. What shaped me most as an entrepreneur was learning from my mother. She embodied the entrepreneurial spirit and taught me one of the most important principles: every time you get knocked down, you’ve got to bounce back with passion. I saw her face bad relationships, bankruptcy, and the stream of daily rejections that comes from being an agent. And she always bounced back. So when the world told me I couldn’t do something or that I was destined to fail, I was ready for them. Thanks to my mom, I already knew how to bounce back.</p><p> Reffkin：成长，这只是我和我的妈妈。她是一个以色列移民，因为我是黑人而被父母斩首。当我年轻的时候，我的父亲抛弃了我们并死了，无家可归。是一个企业家从母亲那里学习的东西是什么形象的。她体现了创业精神，并教给了我最重要的原则之一：每次你被击倒时，你都必须用激情反弹。我看到她面临不良的关系，破产和作为代理人的每日拒绝流。她总是反弹。所以当世界告诉我，我不能做某事或者我注定要失败，我已经为他们做好了准备。感谢我的妈妈，我已经知道如何反弹。</p><p>  Being Black and Jewish, I’ve felt out of place my entire life. In most classes in Hosch school and college, I was the only Black person. In almost every meeting early in my career, I was the only Black person. When I was raising capital for Compass, I almost never saw someone Black on the other side of the table. But I’ve been very fortunate. I’ve been lucky to get terrific advice along the way from so many Black mentors, from the late Vernon Jordan, to Ken Chenault, the former CEO of American Express, to Bayo Ogunlesi, who is lead director for Goldman Sachs. There’s a really strong community of people who’ve all supported each other.</p><p>  黑色和犹太人，我感觉到了我的整个生活。在霍奇学校和大学的大多数课程中，我是唯一的黑人。在我职业生涯的几乎每次会议中，我都是唯一的黑人。当我为指南针提升资本时，我几乎从未在桌子的另一边看到过黑色。但我一直很幸运。我很幸运能够从此从弗农·乔丹的已故弗农·乔丹到肯科克·哥伦（American Express）前任Ceo的肯塔科·奥格莱斯队的途中获得了极大的建议，以至于Goldman Sachs的主要董事。有一个真正强大的人民互相支持。</p><p> TC: You’ve had some impressive mentors over the years. How did those relationships develop? How have they been valuable besides the obvious?</p><p> TC：多年来你有一些令人印象深刻的导师。这些关系是如何发展的？除了显而易见的情况下，它们是如何有价值的？</p><p> Growing up, I was hungry for advice. Coming from a single-parent home, I looked for guidance and wisdom on how to create a better life wherever I could find it. My mom connected me to several non-profits when I was in high school that helped open my eyes to how much opportunity and support there was out there in the world.</p><p> 成长，我渴望建议。来自一个单亲之家，我寻找关于如何在能够找到的地方创造更好的生活的指导和智慧。当我在高中时，我妈妈把我联系到了几个非利润，帮助我的眼睛睁开眼睛，世界上有多少机会和支持。</p><p> The most important lesson I’ve learned in my life is that feedback is a gift. Even when it’s hard to hear, feedback is a gift. My relationships with many of my mentors deepened because I started asking them for really tough, candid feedback — the sort of things they thought other people wouldn’t tell me. And then, I’d actually take their advice, apply it in my life, and let them know how it had helped me. That did two two things: First, it led to more honest and practical advice that helped me get better faster. Second, it made the people who had given me advice feel far more invested in my success and the success of whatI was working on.</p><p> 我生命中学到的最重要的教训是，反馈是礼物。即使很难听到，反馈是礼物。我与许多导师的关系加深了，因为我开始向他们询问他们真正艰难，坦率的反馈 - 他们认为其他人不会告诉我的那种东西。然后，我实际上会采取建议，在我的生活中应用它，让他们知道它是如何帮助我的。这是两件两件事：首先，它导致更诚实和实用的建议，帮助我更快地变得更好。其次，它让我赐给我建议的人感到更多地投资我的成功和当前的成功就在努力。 </p><p>  The other thing my mentors gave me was the sense that even though the world was telling me I couldn’t be successful, I could be. Meeting someone like Vernon Jordan who advised presidents and CEOs alike, had a profound impact on me. He was a father figure to me. I met him when I was 23 years old, and at that time, it wasn’t clear to me that you could be successful in the business world as a Black man. I just hadn’t seen it before. When I started at Lazard, Vernon Jordan was the only other Black investment banker there. He was not just a senior partner, he was a legend, widely known for serving on more Fortune 500 boards than anyone in history. He took a strong interest in me, and with his support and advice, he made me feel like I belonged and helped me see a path where I could be as successful as I wanted to be.</p><p>我的导师给我的另一件事是这种感觉，即使世界告诉我，我就不能成功，我可以。遇见像Vernon Jordan这样的人，他建议总统和CEOS相似，对我产生了深刻的影响。他是一个父亲的身影。当我23岁的时候，当我在那时，我遇到了他，对我来说，你可能会在商业世界中作为一个黑人成功。我以前刚看过它。当我开始在Lazard时，弗农·乔丹是那里唯一的其他黑人投资银行家。他不仅仅是一位高级伙伴，他是一个传奇，广为人知，在历史上的任何人都闻名于更多财富500强董事会。他对我带来了强烈的兴趣，并在他的支持和建议下，他觉得我觉得我所属并帮助我看到一条我想要的道路，就像我想成为一样成功的道路。</p><p> I founded a nonprofit in my twenties called America Needs You that has provided mentorship, career development, and college support to thousands of students. I wrote my new book,    No One Succeeds Alone , as a way to pay it forward by making the lessons I’ve been fortunate enough to learn from so many remarkable people available to everyone — and it’s why I’m donating all of my proceeds to nonprofits that help young people realize their dreams.</p><p> 我在叫做美国的二十几岁的二十几岁的非营利组织需要你提供了媒体，职业发展和大学支持成千上万的学生。我写了我的新书，没有人独自成功，作为一种幸运的方式来支付它，足以从每个人那里获得这么多可用的人们的幸福来学习 - 这就是为什么我捐赠了所有收益的原因帮助年轻人意识到自己的梦想的非营利组织。</p><p> TC: What advice you would give to young, aspiring entrepreneurs, especially those from non-privileged backgrounds?</p><p> TC：您将给予年轻，有抱负的企业家，特别是那些来自非特权背景的建议？</p><p> Reffkin: Here’s the advice I’d give to someone from an underrepresented group who just graduated college and is in their first job:</p><p> Reffkin：这是我从一个刚刚毕业的大学毕业的群体中给某人的建议，并在他们的第一份工作中：</p><p> 1) Don’t let anyone get in the way of your dream. Not society, not your colleagues, not even yourself. Whenever anyone tells you to slow down, speed up.</p><p> 1）不要让任何人妨碍你的梦想。不是社会，而不是你的同事，甚至不是你自己。每当有人告诉你放慢速度，加速。</p><p> 2) Spend the next 10 years learning as much as you can from the smartest people you can. Find mentors in your job and outside that will give you the honest feedback that others won’t. Feedback is a gift. It’ll be hard for you to hear, but it’s actually even harder for them to give it to you. So you may have to ask for it directly and let people know that you can take it.</p><p> 2）在您可以从最聪明的人中尽可能多地学习未来10年。在你的工作中找到导师，外面会给你诚实的反馈，其他人不会。反馈是礼物。你会很难听到，但它们甚至更难地给你。所以你可能不得不直接要求，让人们知道你可以接受它。</p><p> 3) Learn how to turn negativity into positive energy that fuels you. There will always be skeptics, doubters, and haters telling you that you can’t do something or that you don’t belong.</p><p> 3）学习如何将消极性转化为燃烧您的积极能量。总会有怀疑论者，怀疑者和仇敌告诉你你不能做某事或者你不属于。 </p><p>  Reffkin:  I believe that to be truly successful, you can’t have a Plan B. As a CEO, you have to be all-in, and that’s what I am for Compass: 100% dedicated to our 23,000 agents and employees. One of my mentors told me about the “shower test” once — that if you’re not excited enough about your job to think about it in the shower, you’re probably not in the right job. And I’ll tell you: I’m so passionate about the company we’re building that I’m still thinking about Compass in the shower. At Compass, we’ve accomplished much in the past eight years, but we’re truly just getting started.</p><p>Reffkin：我相信要真正成功，你不能拥有一个计划B.作为首席执行官，你必须全方位，这就是我为指南针的东西：100％致力于我们的23,000名代理商和员工。 我的一位导师告诉我关于“淋浴测试”一次 - 如果你在淋浴中的工作不够兴奋，那么你可能没有在正确的工作中。 我会告诉你：我对我们建造的公司非常激情，我还在考虑淋浴的指南针。 在指南针上，我们在过去的八年里完成了很多工作，但我们真的只是入门。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/how-robert-reffkin-went-from-being-a-c-average-student-to-the-founder-of-compass/">https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/how-robert-reffkin-went-from-being-a-c-average-student-to-the-founder-of-compass/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/reffkin/">#reffkin</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/帮助/">#帮助</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
