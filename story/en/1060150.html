It was a great experience for me. I could finally see the place I’d previously only known from books and TV and the tart taste of the Lugol’s iodine I had to drink a few days after the disaster.  After many visits to the plant, I was finally even allowed to enter the damaged Reactor 4 and see the notorious control room. It was here that the failed experiment resulting in the reactor exploding and the uncontrolled emission into the atmosphere of terabecquerels of radioactive isotopes was conducted. A decade ago, obtaining the necessary permits to see the epicenter of the events of April 1986 was extremely arduous and complicated. Today, this place is a must-see on most tourist excursions.</p><p>自从我第一次访问切尔诺贝利核电站以来，已经近10年了。这对我来说是一个很好的经历。我终于看到了我以前只从书籍和电视中熟知的地方，灾难后几天我不得不喝卢瓦尔的碘的馅饼。经过多次访问工厂后，我终于允许进入损坏的反应堆4并看到臭名昭着的控制室。在这里，进行了导致反应器爆炸的失败实验和对放射性同位素的褐色肌肉大气中的不受控制的排放。十年前，获得必要的许可证，了解1986年4月的事件的震中非常艰巨和复杂。今天，这个地方是一个在大多数旅游游览的必看。</p><p> Today I return once again to the plant. This time, I want to see new places that I haven’t yet photographed. When I got permission after several months of effort, sending letters and making phone calls, I was very excited. As one of the staff members in charge of my visit said, I had been granted exclusive access to the nuclear power plant. I can’t wait to find out what this actually means. So, I will be spending the next two days taking photos that I hope to use in the next  HALF-LIFE album. It probably won’t be done any time soon, so in the meantime, I’ll share with you my thoughts about my visit to the power plant and tell you what it was like to photograph it. But, who knows, maybe 10 years from now you’ll be able to see these places with your own eyes.</p><p> 今天我再回到工厂。这一次，我想看到我尚未拍摄的新地方。当我在几个月的努力后获得许可，发送信件并打电话，我很兴奋。作为负责我访问的工作人员之一，我已被授予对核电站的独家访问权限。我迫不及待地想知道这实际上是什么意思。所以，我将在接下来的两天里度过我希望在下一张半场专辑中使用的照片。这可能不会随着时间的时间来完成，所以在此期间，我会与你分享我对电厂的访问，并告诉你它喜欢拍摄它的想法。但是，谁知道，可能会从现在开始10年，你可以用自己的眼睛看到这些地方。</p><p> The reason for my regular visits remains the same: the desire to document the changes taking place in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. And there’s been quite a few: from the construction of the New Safe Confinement (which I  wrote about in more detail here), to the construction of several new industrial facilities that will make the decommissioning of the plant, including the damaged Reactor 4, possible and much safer. I hope that, under the influence of slow but systematic changes, eventually Chernobyl will not only be known as the site of the largest nuclear disaster in the world.</p><p> 我常规访问的原因保持不变：希望在切尔诺贝利禁区中进行更改的愿望。已经有了很少的问题：从建设新的安全禁闭（这里在这里写得更详细），建设了几种新的工业设施，该设施将使工厂退役，包括损坏的反应堆4，可能并更安全。我希望，在缓慢但系统的变化的影响下，最终切尔诺贝利不仅被称为世界上最大的核灾难的网站。</p><p>  All visitors to the Chernobyl power plant must pass through  ABK-1, the administrative and social building which houses the offices of the management and key departments as well as an underground bunker with a crisis center. From here, a narrow 800-m long corridor provides access to the rest of the facility.</p><p>  切尔诺贝利电厂的所有游客必须通过ABK-1，行政和社会楼，包括管理和主要部门的办公室以及带有危机中心的地下掩体。从这里，一个狭窄的800米长的走廊可进入其余设施的进入。</p><p> This time, I start my visit in BK-2, also known as ABK-2. When all four reactors were still in operation, its operations were split with ABK-1. When the last reactor was shut down several years ago, the building was no longer needed and closed.</p><p> 这一次，我在BK-2开始访问，也称为ABK-2。当所有四个反应堆仍在运行时，其运营与ABK-1分开。当几年前关闭最后反应堆时，建筑物不再需要并关闭。</p><p>  The elevator in the main lobby doesn’t inspire confidence. The flashing light and how difficult it is to open the doors make me prefer to take the stairs to the ninth floor. From the window, you can perfectly see the huge bulk of Reactor 3 and, behind it, the New Safe Confinement covering the damaged Reactor 4. This view reminds me of the events of 1986, when miners were working at the base of the several dozen meters high wall. They dug an underground tunnel to pour a concrete slab under the damaged reactor in order to prevent radioactive lava from penetrating into the ground. Then, in the first months after the disaster, all the windows of BK-2 were covered with lead plates to reduce the amount of radiation. Most of the floors were converted into changing rooms and showers for the liquidators. Their job was to clean up the radioactive debris from the reactor explosion. For this task they had to wear thick rubber jumpsuits and lead plates weighing more than 20 kilos and then run the few dozen meters between BK-2 and the wall of Reactor 3. Two or three shovelfuls and then a quick return — that’s how high the radiation was in that place. Even this short time had an impact on their health, but the liquidators weren’t thinking of benefits, money, or awards, they were just doing their soldierly duty.</p><p>  主堂的电梯不会激发信心。闪光灯和打开门的难度让我更喜欢将楼梯乘坐到第九层。从窗户来看，您可以完美地看到巨大的大部分反应堆3，并在它背后，覆盖损坏的反应堆4.这一观点提醒我1986年的活动，当时矿工在几十岁的基地工作时米高墙。他们挖了一个地下隧道，将混凝土板倒在受损反应器下方，以防止放射性熔岩穿透地面。然后，在灾难发生后的第一个月，BK-2的所有窗口都被引线板覆盖，以减少辐射量。大多数楼层被转换成更衣室和淋浴的清理人。他们的工作是清理反应堆爆炸的放射性碎片。对于这项任务，他们必须穿厚厚的橡胶跳跃和铅板重20公斤，然后在BK-2和反应堆墙之间运行几十米。两三个铲，然后快速回归 - 这是多高的辐射在那个地方。即使是这种短暂的时间也对他们的健康产生了影响，但清算人不是在考虑福利，金钱或奖项，他们只是在做他们的士兵。</p><p>  No traces of these events are visible today. Outside, it’s quiet and peaceful; the piles of contaminated soil and debris from under the reactor have long since disappeared. The surrounding area has been covered with asphalt. I return to the present and systematically, floor by floor, look into each room. When I find something interesting, I photograph it. Although most of the valuable items or important documents are long gone, I still see many interesting reminders from a few or many years ago. To some, these objects might appear useless or meaningless; to others, they are valuable artifacts recalling the times when this plant produced electricity. The two workers accompanying me seem to share my opinion because they explore the corners of every room with great enthusiasm. Whenever they find something worthy of attention, they call me over. Without their help, I would have missed some interesting things.</p><p>  今天没有可见这些事件的痕迹。外面，这是安静和宁静的;从反应器下方的污染土壤和碎片已经消失了。周边地区已覆盖着沥青。我返回现在和系统地，楼层楼，看看每个房间。当我找到有趣的东西时，我拍照。虽然大多数有价值的物品或重要文件已经不复存了一致，但我仍然从几年或多年前看到了许多有趣的提醒。对于一些，这些物体可能出现无用或毫无意义;对于别人来说，他们是有价值的工件回顾了这种植物产生的电力时的时代。陪伴我的两名工人似乎分享了我的意见，因为他们以极大的热情探索每个房间的角落。每当他们找到一些值得关注的东西时，他们都会打电话给我。没有他们的帮助，我会错过一些有趣的东西。 </p><p>        Wandering around inside the building and looking into all the rooms is reminiscent of urbex, the exploration of abandoned man-made structures. Maybe the difference is that urbex is usually done without permission of the property’s owners, while I am here completely legally.</p><p>在建筑物内部徘徊并调查所有房间都让人想起URBEX，探索被遗弃的人造结构。也许区别在于urbex通常在财产所有者许可的情况下进行，而我在这里完全合法。</p><p> When we’re about to leave, I decide to check the basement. It’s a natural reflex that’s developed over years of documenting the Chernobyl Zone. It is often in these places – dark, inconspicuous, and difficult to access – that I’ve found many valuable, undamaged artifacts.</p><p> 当我们即将离开时，我决定检查地下室。它是一种自然的反射，它是多年的记录切尔诺贝利区域的发展。它通常在这些地方 - 黑暗，不起眼的，难以访问 - 我发现了许多有价值的，无损害的神器。</p><p>  Right at the start, I come across massive steel doors. Identical to the ones in the bunker located in the basement of ABK-1. There, they lead to the crisis center where the course of action following the 1986 disaster was directed. I  visited the center several years ago. Unfortunately, I’m not able to check what’s behind these armored doors. The mechanism is completely rusted, making it impossible to open them and look inside.</p><p>  在开始时，我遇到了大规模的钢门。与位于ABK-1的地下室的地堡中的那些相同。在那里，他们导致危机中心在1986年灾难所在的行动方案。几年前我访问了该中心。不幸的是，我无法检查这些装甲门后面。该机制是完全生锈的，使得不可能打开它们并看内部。</p><p>  Anyone who has visited the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and stood in front of the old sarcophagus and later the New Safe Confinement that covers it has probably wondered about the tall gray building to its left. This is the Interim Spent Nuclear Fuel Storage Facility, the next place on my list of places to visit.</p><p>  任何访问切尔诺贝利禁区的人并站在旧的石棺面前，后来覆盖它可能会想到它左侧高大的灰色建筑的新安全限制。这是临时废旧核燃纳储存设施，下一步在我的访问名单上。</p><p>  As with all active nuclear facilities, there is a strict security regime here. The first barrier after entering the building are the massive security revolving doors with electronic access control. However, before the plant employee accompanying me can insert his card and enter his PIN, he has to call security and announce our visit. Just outside the door is another metal-detecting gate, with two armed soldiers standing watch next to it. One of them meticulously checks the numbers on my passport and photographic equipment, digit by digit. Fortunately, everything checks out and we can head in further. But before we are allowed to enter the main part of the complex, aka the dirty zone, we have to change into protective gear and masks. We are also given a dosimeter that counts the dose of radiation absorbed. When we exit, the procedure is repeated in reverse order and so on in every complex we visit. Sometimes, the procedures take longer than our stay inside the facility.</p><p>  与所有活跃的核设施一样，这里有严格的安全制度。进入建筑物后的第一个屏障是具有电子访问控制的大规模安全旋转门。但是，在陪伴我的工厂员工之前可以插入他的卡并进入他的密码，他必须召唤安全并宣布我们的访问。就在门外是另一个金属探测门，两个武装士兵站在它旁边。其中一个精心地检查我的护照和摄影设备上的数字，按数字数字。幸运的是，一切都在退房，我们可以进一步前进。但在我们被允许进入复杂的主要部分之前，又名脏区，我们必须换成防护装备和面具。我们还给予剂量计，这些剂量计重视吸收的辐射剂量。当我们退出时，我们访问的每个复杂程序都以相反的顺序重复该过程。有时，程序比我们在设施内的逗留时间更长。</p><p>  First, I meet with the facility’s chief engineer. After a few formalities, he takes me on a tour of the entire complex and describes the processes that take place here. First, we got to the largest hall where there is a huge pool with more than 21,000 spent fuel assemblies from reactors 1-3. Depending on the location, radiation levels vary from 40 to 800 μSv/h, which is about 200-400 times higher than normal. The ISF-1 is a wet-type spent fuel storage facility, meaning that the fuel assemblies are stored in water. The huge pool consists of five reinforced concrete tanks covered by hundreds of steel plates. As I step on them, I feel rather strange and insecure because I know what lies beneath them. Additionally, every step I take causes the steel flaps to move, causing a sound that echoes throughout the hall. I’m only calmed by the sight of the engineer, who confidently steps on the plates, not looking at me at all. After a moment, the engineer bends down and opens one. The radiation increases, but only slightly. The lack of a cover doesn’t change all that much; the greatest barrier against the radiation is the water.</p><p>  首先，我与设施的总工程师见面。经过几个手续的手续，他带我参观整个综合体，并描述了这里发生的过程。首先，我们到达最大的大厅，有一个巨大的游泳池，距离反应堆1-3件有超过21,000个燃料组件。根据该位置，辐射水平从40到800μSV/ h之间变化，比正常高约200-400倍。 ISF-1是湿式燃料储存设施，这意味着燃料组件储存在水中。巨大的水池由五个钢板覆盖的五个钢筋混凝土罐组成。当我踏上他们时，我觉得很奇怪，不安全，因为我知道他们下面的是什么。此外，我采取的每一步都会导致钢襟翼移动，导致整个大厅呼应的声音。我只是通过镜头镇静的工程师，他们自信地踩到了盘子上，而不是看着我。经过一瞬间，工程师向下弯曲并打开一个。辐射增加，但仅略微。缺乏封面不会改变所有这些;对辐射的最大障碍是水。</p><p>    The fuel assemblies are pulled out in the hall next door. Now I can stay here freely, but the radiation levels during this procedure are very high – about 2 Sv/h. This is already a dose that can cause serious radiation sickness or even death. Due to this, the entire process is controlled remotely through a small window made of thick leaded glass or through a system of monitors and cameras from a small room located several meters above us.</p><p>    燃料组件在隔壁的大厅中拔出。现在我可以自由留在这里，但此过程中的辐射水平非常高 - 约2 sv / h。这已经是一种剂量，可能导致严重的辐射疾病甚至死亡。由此，整个过程通过由厚的铅玻璃制成的小窗户远程控制，或通过来自位于我们几米的小房间的监视器和摄像机系统。 </p><p>   Once the long metal rods containing the fuel have been pulled out of the water and placed in a huge, missile-shaped basket, they are lowered and put onto a specially constructed train. Only then can they be taken safely outside. What for? As the complex’s name suggests, it was not designed for long-term storage of the spent fuel, as its design life ends in 2028. This place will be the next item on my agenda.</p><p>一旦含有燃料的长金属杆被拉出水并放置在巨大的导弹形篮子中，它们就会降低并放在专门建造的火车上。只有这样，他们才能安全地放在外面。做什么的？随着复杂的名称表明，由于其设计生活在2028年结束，因此它不是用于长期储存的燃料。这个地方将是我议程上的下一个项目。</p><p>     The ISF-2 complex serves as an interim storage facility for dry-type spent fuel assemblies. Before the spent fuel goes there, it is processed first in a building located on the premises.</p><p>     ISF-2配合物用作干式废燃料组件的临时储存设施。在花费燃料到达那里，它首先在位于房屋的建筑物中处理。</p><p>   Inside, my attention is drawn to the “hot chamber”, the heart of the entire building. A huge, hermetically sealed room, completely isolated from the external environment by thick concrete walls; you can look inside through small leaded glass windows located on both sides of the chamber. Cameras resistant to high levels of radiation and remote-controlled machinery and tools have been installed inside. It is here that the spent fuel assemblies from the defunct reactors will be cut in half, dried, and later packed into double-layered steel canisters.</p><p>   里面，我的注意力被绘制到“热门房”，整个建筑的核心。巨大，密封的房间，通过厚实的混凝土墙完全从外部环境隔离;您可以通过位于腔室两侧的小型带玻璃窗的内部。内部安装了耐高采烈辐射和遥控机械和工具的摄像机。这里的是，废物反应器中的燃料组件将切成两半，干燥，后来填充到双层钢罐中。</p><p>   Outside the chamber are monitors, consoles, and large arms topped by manipulators and buttons used to remotely perform even the most complex operations. To a layman unfamiliar with the steps for processing nuclear fuel, it’s truly an impressive sight. When I look through the thick leaded glass at all these machines and tools, I think of the sci-fi film  Alien: Resurrection where attempts are made in a similar chamber to subdue a dangerous xenomorph. With predictable results.</p><p>   腔室外部是由机械手和按钮顶部的监视器，控制台和大型臂，用于远程执行最复杂的操作。对于加工核燃料的步骤而不熟悉的外行，这是一个令人印象深刻的景象。当我在所有这些机器和工具上透过厚厚的铅玻璃时，我想到了SCI-FI胶片外星：复活，其中在类似的腔室中尝试制定危险的Xenomorph。具有可预测的结果。</p><p>   But, back to reality. The view of the hot chamber makes me realize how dangerous a task we have before us. And a long-term one, since the radioactive isotopes in the fuel will take thousands of years to decay. 100 years, the storage period for the processed fuel in ISF-2, is just a blink of an eye for radioactive isotopes. What’s next? ISF-3? We don’t know yet. Perhaps technologies will emerge that will allow us to reprocess and use the fuel for other purposes, or perhaps it will end up in an underground radioactive waste dump. This is the problem we will face – well, not us but future generations.</p><p>   但是，回到现实。热门房间的视野让我意识到我们面前的任务有多危险。和长期的，因为燃料中的放射性同位素将需要数千年来腐烂。 100年来，ISF-2中加工燃料的储存期仅仅是放射性同位素的眨眼。下一步是什么？ ISF-3？我们还不知道。也许可以出现的技术将使我们能够重新处理并使用燃料以获取其他目的，或者可能会在地下放射性废物垃圾堆中最终。这是我们将面临的问题 - 嗯，不是美国但后代。</p><p>   In December 2020, the “hot tests” for the whole complex concluded. At that time, 22 containers with 186 fuel assemblies had been processed for the first time and then packed into two steel canisters and stored in concrete modules behind the main building. It is estimated that the entire fuel processing process will take about 10 years, and the complex will become the world’s largest dry spent fuel storage facility.</p><p>   2020年12月，整个复合体的“热门测试”得出结论。当时，第一次处理了22个具有186燃料组件的容器，然后装入两个钢罐子并储存在主楼后面的混凝土模块中。据估计，整个燃料加工过程需要大约10年，并且复杂将成为世界上最大的干燥燃料储存设施。</p><p>   In addition to the ISF-1 and ISF-2, which deal with spent nuclear fuel, another two facilities have been built on the site for the treatment of solid and liquid radioactive waste collected from the operation and decommissioning of the power plant and from the sarcophagus. I visit the first, where low-, intermediate- and high-level waste is processed for temporary or final storage, including concrete, sand, and metal. The huge building contains a system of airtight caissons, hot chambers, and other areas where radioactive waste is cut, fragmented, shredded, sorted by radioactivity level, compressed, and incinerated. All of the work is done using remote-controlled machines to which interchangeable tools can be attached — including a jackhammer, concrete crusher, chainsaw, and hydraulic shears. The processed waste is then encapsulated and sealed in concrete containers before being sent to a radioactive waste repository. Like the ISF-2, the plant has already processed its first batch of radioactive waste and currently is in the final stages of hot testing and certification.</p><p>   除了处理废核燃料的ISF-1和ISF-2之外，还建立了另外两种设施，用于治疗从电厂的运行和退役中收集的固体和液体放射性废物的固体和液体放射性废物。石棺。我访问了第一个，在那里处理临时或最终储存的低，中级和高级废物，包括混凝土，沙子和金属。巨大的建筑包含一个气密沉箱，热室等系统和其他区域的区域，通过放射性水平，压缩和焚烧排序，分散，破碎。所有工作都是使用远程控制机器完成可互换工具的可互换工具 - 包括Jackhammer，混凝土破碎机，电锯和液压剪切。然后将处理的废物封装并在混凝土容器中密封，然后被发送到放射性废物库。与ISF-2一样，该工厂已经处理了首批放射性废物，目前正在进行热门测试和认证的最后阶段。 </p><p>         The New Safe Confinement (NSC) is a huge 110-meter-high steel construction that was built to cover the old, worn-out sarcophagus. It reduces the negative impact of radiation on the environment, the public, and employees. The cranes mounted on the top of the structure will make it easier to dismantle the unstable old sarcophagus and remove the nuclear fuel and materials containing it located inside.</p><p>新的安全监禁（NSC）是一个巨大的110米高的钢结构，用于覆盖旧的磨损的石棺。它降低了辐射对环境，公众和员工的负面影响。安装在结构顶部的起重机将使更容易拆除不稳定的旧石棺，并删除包含它位于内部的核燃料和材料。</p><p>   I have  visited the NSC many times during its construction and after it was completed and slid over the old sarcophagus. I mentioned at the time that without proper perspective, it’s hard to assess the size of the structure in its entirety. That is why this time I’m visiting it with the intention of taking a photo with a human figure in it so you can see just how enormous it is. The main purpose of my visit, however, is to see the old sarcophagus beneath it.</p><p>   在建筑过程中，我已经访问了NSC，并且在完成并在旧的石棺上滑动并滑动。我在没有适当的角度的情况下提到的，很难以整体评估结构的大小。这就是为什么这次我正在访问它的意图，目的是用一个人的身影拍照，所以你可以看到它有多巨大。然而，我的访问的主要目的是看到它下面的旧石棺。</p><p>  As most readers probably know, the sarcophagus was built over the ruins of the building covering the damaged Reactor 4 in order to reduce the radioactive contamination emitted after the disaster. Working under the pressure of time and in extremely difficult and dangerous conditions, the workers completed their task in a record 206 days. No work is currently being carried out inside it, although the structural integrity of the entire complex and the condition of the control/measurement equipment installed within are regularly checked to ensure its nuclear, radioactive and seismic safety. This is the responsibility of, among others, the staff of the Operation Shop and the Radiation Safety Shop. The latter is responsible for the safety of personnel during maintenance and repair work as well as routinely monitoring the radiation situation inside the facility. This is done by dosimetrists, with whom I meet in an inconspicuous room near the entrance to the old sarcophagus.</p><p>  由于大多数读者可能都知道，石棺建造在覆盖损坏的反应器4的建筑物的废墟上，以减少灾难后排放的放射性污染。在时间的压力下工作，在极度困难和危险的情况下，工人在纪录206天内完成了他们的任务。目前没有任何工作，尽管定期检查整个复合体的结构完整性以及安装在内的控制/测量设备的状况，以确保其核，放射性和地震安全性。这是行动商店和辐射安全商店的工作人员的责任。后者负责维护和维修工作期间人员的安全，并常规监测设施内的辐射情况。这是由dosimetrists完成的，我在靠近旧石棺附近的一个不起眼的房间里遇到的。</p><p> Most of the room is occupied by desks on which, besides computers and monitors, are detailed plans of each floor of the sarcophagus. On the wall hangs a map of the entire complex on which zones with different levels of access are marked. However, most of the space is taken up by cabinets with neat rows of dosimeters used by staff entering the sarcophagus. The dosimetrists are not very talkative and are reluctant to respond to my request to tell me about their jobs. They only come alive when I ask them to take me inside the sarcophagus and show me what their job is like in practice.</p><p> 除了电脑和监视器之外，大多数房间都被桌子占用，是石棺每个楼层的详细计划。在墙壁上挂起整个复合体的地图，在该地图上标明了具有不同级别的区域。然而，大多数空间被橱柜占用，员工进入石棺使用的员工使用整齐的一排排剂量计。剂量分子不是非常健谈的，不愿意回复我的要求告诉我他们的工作。当我要求他们带我进入石棺内并向我展示他们的工作就像在实践中一样活着。</p><p>     It seems that they agree because I’m given a dosimeter and strict orders not to touch anything. I now have three such devices with me: two count the received dose and the third the current radiation level. First, we take the main staircase 059/2 to level +3 and from there we enter the sarcophagus. For safety reasons, the dosimetrist goes first. We go deep into a long corridor and then down steel stairs. Old paint is peeling everywhere and thick metal pipes and tangled electric wires stretch along either side of us. Everything is covered by a special solution that binds dust and impedes the spread of radioactive isotopes. It gives the surfaces a pink, glossy color.</p><p>     似乎他们同意，因为我给了一个剂量表和严格的订单，不要触摸任何东西。我现在有三种这样的设备：两个计数接收的剂量和第三个电流辐射水平。首先，我们将主要楼梯059/2拿到级别+3，从那里进入石棺。出于安全原因，Dosimetrist首先。我们深入走进了一条长长的走廊，然后走了钢铁楼梯。旧油漆到处都是剥离，厚厚的金属管，沿着我们两侧伸展的缠结电线。一切都被一个特殊的解决方案所覆盖，它绑定灰尘并阻碍放射性同位素的蔓延。它给出了粉红色，光泽的颜色。</p><p>   Before each room hangs a piece of paper with a number and a name that means nothing to me: 101/4 – Трасса откачки ЖРО ОУ, then 101/3 – РУСН-6kB, etc. It is only after I return that I’m able to decipher all of the abbreviations and descriptions: the route for pumping liquid radioactive waste, switchgear 6kV, etc.</p><p>   每间房间挂在一个有一个数字和一个名字的纸之前，这对我没有任何意义：101/4  - трассаоткачкижроу，那么101/3  - Русн-6kb等。只有在我回来之后我能够破译所有缩写和描述：泵送液体放射性废物，开关设备6kV等的路线</p><p>   In this labyrinth of near-identical corridors, I quickly lose my sense of direction and, after a while, I stop paying attention to the signs. I blindly follow the dosimetrist. Although the masks prevent us from breathing in radioactive dust, there is nothing we can do to protect ourselves from the gamma radiation penetrating our bodies. Unseen dangers may lurk around every corner. In such a situation, the dosimeters are our eyes; thanks to them we know how far we can go.</p><p>   在这个近乎相同的走廊迷宫中，我很快就会失去我的方向，经过一段时间，我停止关注标志。我盲目地遵循剂量司司专家。虽然面具防止我们在放射性尘埃中呼吸，但我们可以做任何我们可以从凝视我们身体的伽玛辐射来保护自己。看不见的危险可能会潜伏在每个角落周围。在这种情况下，剂量计是我们的眼睛;感谢他们，我们知道我们可以走多远。 </p><p>      The thought that I’m moving through a mysterious labyrinth of radioactive corridors covered by two sarcophagi stresses me out and increases my feelings of uncertainty and confusion. I try with all my might to concentrate on taking pictures, but the fast pace, poor lighting, and the lack of a tripod don’t make things any easier. Despite this, holding the dosimeter in one hand and my camera in the other, I try to take sharp images. I’m shooting in bursts hoping that one of the photos will come out not blurred. Suddenly, the dosimetrist stops and looks intently at the device’s display. He moves the aluminum rod on which it is mounted in every direction and tries to find the source of the increased radiation. On my dosimeter, the radiation level is still relatively low, but I am several meters behind him. Our face masks make communication difficult, so I step closer and peek over his shoulder. The red display reads over 1000 μSv/h and still rising. That’s about 5000 times higher than outside, but still relatively safe at least in the short term. Unfortunately, my dosimetrist disagrees and gives the signal that we need to head back.</p><p>我认为我透过了两个Sarcophag覆盖的放射性走廊的神秘迷宫的想法会强调我，增加了我的不确定性和混乱的感觉。我尽我所能专注于拍照，但快速的速度，照明差，缺乏三脚架不要让事情变得更容易。尽管如此，在一方面握住剂量计，另一方面，我试图采取尖锐的图像。我在爆发中射击，希望其中一个照片不会模糊。突然，剂型剂师停止并在设备的显示屏上专注地看起来。他移动其在每个方向上安装的铝棒，并试图找到增加的辐射源。在我的剂量表上，辐射水平仍然相对较低，但我在他身后几米。我们的脸上的面具使沟通困难，所以我走近他的肩膀。红色显示屏读取超过1000μsv/ h并仍在上升。这比外部高约5000倍，但至少在短期内比较安全。不幸的是，我的剂量司专家不同意，并给出了我们需要回头的信号。</p><p>    We can’t go any further; the radiation is too high. It doesn’t matter to the dosimetrist that I’ve been in more radioactive places before. I’m just a photographer and he’s responsible for my safety. Besides, it’s better that my dosimeter doesn’t read more than the dose specified in the permit because otherwise we’d both be in trouble. Despite this, I feel great satisfaction at being one of the few photographers in the world able to visit this place. To see more, I think I’d need to complete a dosimetry course and get a job at the plant…</p><p>    我们不能进一步走去;辐射太高。对于前沿的手机来说，我以前在更放射性的地方并不重要。我只是一个摄影师，他对自己的安全负责。此外，更好的是，我的剂量计不仅仅是许可证中规定的剂量更好，因为否则我们都遇到了麻烦。尽管如此，我对世界上几个能够访问这个地方的摄影师之一感到非常满意。要查看更多，我认为我需要完成一个装备的课程并在工厂获得工作......</p><p>  After returning home, I start to post-process the photos. It turns out that besides the interior of the sarcophagus I captured something else. Something no less interesting, albeit much more dangerous. In several of the pictures, I notice some small, bright spots. At first, I think it’s due to a high ISO, dirty sensor, or some mistakes made during the post-processing process. However, upon closer inspection of the photos, I come to the realization that my camera’s sensor has captured invisible radiation! It’s really “hot” out there!</p><p>  回到家后，我开始后处理照片。事实证明，除了石棺的内部，我捕获了其他东西。一些不太有趣的东西，尽管更危险。在几张图片中，我注意到一些小，明亮的斑点。起初，我认为它是由于在后处理过程中产生的高ISO，肮脏的传感器或一些错误。但是，在仔细检查照片后，我实现了我的相机传感器已经捕获了看不见的辐射！那里真的是“热”！</p><p>  About the author: Arkadiusz Podniesiński is a Polish photographer and filmmaker, a technical diver, and a graduate of Oxford Brookes University in Great Britain.
