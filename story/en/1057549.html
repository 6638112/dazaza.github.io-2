When I arrive at dawn before the bidding begins, three men are seated at folding tables, waiting for a darkened television screen to flicker on. The drone and dribble of a Keurig coffee machine is the only sound interrupting the silence. It promises to be another wistful day in a long series of wistful days.</p><p>  在马萨诸塞州新贝德福德的鱼拍卖，这是另一个安静的7月日。当我在竞标开始前达到黎明时，三名男子坐在折叠桌子上，等待变暗的电视屏幕闪烁。 keurig咖啡机的无人机和运球是唯一中断沉默的声音。它承诺成为一系列渴望的渴望日子。</p><p> Last night, just nine fishing boats pulled up to the dock behind the building, far fewer than the hundreds of boats lining up for the old city auction on Pier 3 in the 1980s. Back then, boats would haul in as much as 500 tonnes of cod, haddock, flounder, and other species of groundfish from the icy depths of the North Atlantic. Today’s groundfish catch is 4.3 tonnes. Most of the money keeping the port afloat is in scallops.</p><p> 昨晚，只有九艘渔船拉到了大楼后面的码头，比20世纪80年代码头3的旧城市拍卖会少于数百艘船。回到后，船只会在500吨的鳕鱼，黑桥，比目鱼和其他北大西洋的冰冷深处的土鱼中拖运。今天的壁鱼捕获是4.3吨。保持港口漂浮的大部分资金都在扇贝中。</p><p> I start to pull out a chair to take a seat when I hear a voice behind me. “I don’t think you want to do that,” says a lanky, gray-haired man reading a magazine. “The guy who normally sits in that chair will choke you to death.”</p><p> 当我在我身后听到声音时，我开始拔出椅子坐座位。 “我不认为你想这样做，”一个读一本杂志的洛克，灰色的男人说。 “通常坐在那位椅子上的那个人会让你失望。”</p><p> “Choke you to death on cigarette smoke!” cracks a black guy with a patch on his beret that reads, “I’m Cape Verdean.”</p><p> “在香烟烟雾中扼杀你死！”在他的贝雷帽上撕裂一个黑人，读书，“我是佛得角。”</p><p> After I move to the back row, a big-bellied, bald man in a plaid shirt pushes past the No Smoking sign on the front door and walks into the room. He takes his seat and lights up a Winston cigarette. He spits out a few words about a dissatisfied fish buyer to the auction owner in raspy Portuguese. Then, he switches to English. “Tell him he can go fuck himself, the fish is fine,” he growls. “I saw every fucking one, it’s his fucking problem.” It doesn’t take me long to realize that this is Carlos Rafael, otherwise known as The Codfather, who was out of jail on a US $2-million bond. Under the table, an electronic monitoring bracelet is beaming his location to federal authorities who are making sure he gets back to his house every night by 8:30 p.m.</p><p> 在我搬到后排之后，格子衬衫的一个大鼓结的秃头男子推动了前门上的禁烟标志，走进房间。他带着他的座位，点燃一个温斯顿香烟。他吐出了一些关于一个不满意的鱼买家的拍卖所有者在Raspy葡萄牙人的拍卖所有者。然后，他切换到英语。 “告诉他他可以去他妈的自己，鱼很好，”他咆哮着。 “我看到了每个他妈的一个，这是他他妈的问题。”它不需要我很长时间意识到这是Carlos Rafael，否则被称为Codfather，谁在200亿美元的债券上没有监狱。在桌面下，电子监控手镯将他的位置发射到联邦当局，他们每天晚上8:30每晚都会回到他家。</p><p> Even as Rafael awaits a criminal trial on charges that he lied to the government about netting nearly 370 tonnes of tightly managed fish and then enlisted a sheriff’s deputy to help him smuggle his ill-gotten cash profits to Portugal, the 65-year-old remains the most powerful man in what is still the richest fishing port in the United States. On the walls of the dingy auction house hang photos of Rafael’s hunter-green vessels with “CR” embossed on their bows in gold like a royal cypher. He owns 36 fishing vessels that control one-fifth of New England’s cod quota, along with permits for lobsters, scallops, and other seafood. Some of his boats are named after the Portuguese islands of his youth:  Ilha do Corvo and the  Açores. Other names are plucked from Greek mythology and include Poseidon, Hercules, and Hera—the goddess known for her jealous rages and a name he liked so much he used it twice. He is also a buyer of fish, lording over a vertically integrated empire likely worth more than $100-million.</p><p> 即使Rafael等待刑事审判，他欺骗了他对政府留下近370吨的紧密托管鱼类，然后邀请了一个警长的副手，以帮助他把他的不良现金利润脱落给葡萄牙，这是65岁的遗体最强大的男人仍然是美国最富有的渔港。在乡村拍卖宫的墙上，Rafael的猎人 - 绿色船只的照片与“Cr”浮雕在金色的蝴蝶结像一个皇家的cypher那样。他拥有36艘渔船，控制新英格兰的五分之一的鳕鱼配额，以及龙虾，扇贝和其他海鲜的许可证。他的一些船只以葡萄牙人的青年岛屿命名：Ilha do Corvo和Açores。其他名称从希腊神话中拔出，包括Poseidon，Hercules和Hera  - 为她嫉妒的愤怒而闻名的女神，他喜欢他的名字他用两次。他也是鱼的买家，垂直综合帝国的霸主可能超过1000万美元。 </p><p>  The criminal charges against Rafael couldn’t come at a worse time for the fishing industry here, which has been beaten down by the unforgiving arithmetic of the underwater world. While haddock have multiplied to healthy numbers, cod and flounder stocks remain excruciatingly, stubbornly, almost spitefully, low. But because trawl nets are indiscriminate, fishermen can’t readily take advantage of the haddock bounty without exceeding pitiful caps on diminished stocks. Locals say they spend more time avoiding fish than trying to catch them.</p><p>对拉法埃尔的刑事指控无法在这里捕捞行业的时间差，这被海底世界的无情算术被殴打。虽然黑桥乘以健康的数字，但鳕鱼和比目鱼股仍然令人沮丧地顽固，顽固，几乎恶意地低。但由于拖网净不分青刺激，渔民不能轻易利用皮托克赏金而不超过可怜的股票上的可怜的帽子。当地人说他们花了更多的时间来避免鱼，而不是试图抓住他们。</p><p> Some fishermen want to make the rules more flexible, working with regulators to open up closed fishing grounds, change rules on fishing gear, and put a cap on how big a chunk of the fishery a single person can control. But Rafael’s lies have polluted data on the health of a large fraction of New England’s 20 groundfish stocks and, potentially, scallops as well, making any reform all the more controversial. If the only people thriving are crooks—and Rafael’s fleet has racked up more serious violations than most—it raises the question of whether groundfishing in New England has an honest future.</p><p> 一些渔民希望使规则更加灵活，与监管机构合作开辟封闭的渔场，改变渔具的规则，并将渔业的一大块块的大部分缩小一个人可以控制。但拉斐尔的谎言已经污染了关于新英格兰20个壁前股票的大部分健康的数据，并且潜在地，扇贝也是如此改革更具争议。如果唯一蓬勃发展的人是骗子 - 而拉斐尔的舰队已经比大多数人更严重的违规行为 - 它提出了在新英格兰的磨砺有一个诚实的未来的问题。</p><p> I had called Rafael on his cellphone before showing up here, and he warned me if I stopped by his business, Carlos Seafood, he’d throw me out. After the auction, I introduce myself and ask if he’d be willing to talk seafood. He scans my face with his eyes, like a fish cutter deciding where to plunge the knife. “No,” he says. To tell his story I’d have to unravel his legacy without his assistance, but he had left behind a trail of court documents, government records, embittered rivals, and, most damningly, his own words.</p><p> 在这里出现之前，我在手机上叫Rafael，如果我被他的事业停下来，他警告我，他会把我扔掉。拍卖后，我介绍自己并询问他是否愿意谈谈海鲜。他用眼睛扫视我的脸，就像一个鱼切割机决定在哪里撞到刀子。 “不，”他说。要讲述他的故事，我必须在没有他的帮助下揭开他的遗产，但他留下了法院文件的踪迹，政府记录，怒目而投的竞争对手，最达到的，他自己的话。</p><p>  The king of New England groundfish was born on Portuguese soil on June 29, 1952. It was an oppressive time for the Portuguese people, under the rule of a dictatorship for over two decades, which—like most imperial powers at the time—was struggling with colonial independence movements. Rafael grew up on the Azores islands, well over 1,000 kilometers from the mainland, but the distance would not buffer him from the military draft. At the age of 12, his father sent him to a monastery school to avoid fighting in Portugal’s wars in Africa. But Rafael dreamed of a freer life and orchestrated his expulsion as part of his personal campaign to get his family to move to America. It worked. In 1968, when Rafael was 15, he arrived in Massachusetts, according to a 2004 interview he gave as part of a New Bedford oral history project.</p><p>  新英格兰王妃的国王于1952年6月29日出生在葡萄酒土壤上。这是葡萄牙人的压迫时间，根据独裁者的统治，超过二十年，这是一种像最时代的大多数帝国权力 - 正在挣扎殖民独立运动。拉斐尔在亚塞尔群岛长大，距离大陆超过1000公里，但远距离不会从军事汇票中缓冲他。在12岁时，他的父亲把他送到了一个修道院学校，以避免在葡萄牙在非洲的战争中战斗。但拉斐尔梦想着实现自由的生活，并将驱逐他的驱逐成为他个人运动的一部分，让他的家人搬到美国。有效。 1968年，当Rafael为15时，他抵达马萨诸塞州，根据2004年采访，他作为新的贝德福德口头历史项目的一部分。</p><p> In a poetic way, Rafael was simply following generations of Portuguese before him. From its earliest days as a whaling port—it was on these cobbled streets that Herman Melville was inspired to write  Moby Dick—New Bedford has been attracting Portuguese seamen. Parts of the city today feel less like a Yankee fishing village and more like old Portugal. At Tia Maria’s European Cafe, you can still get  chouriço sandwiches on Portuguese rolls and finish it off with an espresso and a  pastel de  nata—a traditional custard tart.</p><p> 以诗意的方式，拉斐尔只是在他面前追随几代葡萄牙语。从最早的日子开始作为捕鲸的港口 - 它在这些鹅卵石街道上，赫尔曼·梅尔维尔受到启发，撰写莫迪迪克 - 新贝德福德一直吸引葡萄牙海员。这座城市的一部分今天感觉不像洋基渔村，更像是老葡萄牙。在Tia Maria的欧洲咖啡馆，您仍然可以在葡萄牙卷上获得Chouriço三明治，并用浓咖啡和淡紫色的丁香挞完成它。</p><p> Rafael’s first job in his new country was making  linguiça sausage at Amaral’s—a New Bedford institution still in operation today. Back in those days, the money in New Bedford was all about cod, so, naturally, Rafael moved into the fish business.</p><p> Rafael在他新的国家的第一份工作在Amaral's-A仍在今天仍在运营中制作了Linguiça香肠。回到那些日子里，新贝德福德的钱都是关于鳕鱼，所以，自然地，拉斐尔搬进了鱼业。</p><p> Eighty kilometers off the coast lies Georges Bank, an underwater mesa where the Gulf Stream collides with the Labrador Current, stirring up nutrients from the depths and creating one of the most productive marine areas on Earth. From February to April, large schools of cod rise from the Atlantic and migrate across the rocky, shallow waters of the bank in order to spawn and hunt eels and other prey. Cod are a wise-looking fish. They can grow upward of 90 kilograms over their 20-year lifespan and have a fleshy sensory organ dangling from their chin that looks like a Fu Manchu mustache. Battered and fried, cod are the fish of choice for fish and chips. The Portuguese like to dry and salt them—a preparation known as  bacalhau.</p><p> 距离海岸八十公里谎言乔治银行，一个水下梅萨，海湾流与拉布拉多州的电流碰撞，从深处搅拌营养素，并在地球上创造一个最富有成效的海域地区之一。从2月到4月，大型鳕鱼从大西洋和迁移到岩石，浅滩的岩石中涌现，以撒上鳗鱼和其他猎物。鳕鱼是一个明智的鱼。他们可以在20年的20年寿命上向上增长90公斤，肉体感觉器官从他们的下巴悬挂着，看起来像一个富曼城胡子。被打击和炒，鳕鱼是鱼和薯条的选择。葡萄牙语喜欢干燥和盐盐 - 一种称为Bacalhau的制备。 </p><p> Rafael started hauling boxes of fish, and eventually became an apprentice fish cutter on the wharf. “Six, seven months later, I was the second or the third best cutter that they had in there,” Rafael said in his oral history. “I went to the owner and I told him, ‘You gotta give me a raise.’” When the owner refused, Rafael started working for a competitor.</p><p>拉斐尔开始搬运了鱼盒，最终成为码头上的学徒鱼切割机。 “六个，七个月后，我是他们在那里的第二个或第三个最佳刀具，”拉斐尔在他的口头历史中说道。 “我去了主人，我告诉他，”你得给我一个提升。“”当店主拒绝时，拉斐尔开始为竞争对手工作。</p><p> After a few years climbing the ranks, he saw an opportunity to launch his own business, Portuguese-American Seafood, by operating as a so-called nightrider. While many fishermen sold their catch at the old city auction each morning, those who were more impatient, more desperate for cash, or wanted to avoid taxes, would unload directly with Rafael at cut-rate prices. “Buy low and sell high, that’s the name of the game,” Rafael said.</p><p> 经过几年的攀登队伍，他看到机会通过作为所谓的Nightrider来推动自己的商业，葡萄牙美洲海鲜。虽然许多渔民每天早上在旧城市拍卖会上出售他们的赛车，那些更不耐烦，更绝望的现金，或者想要避免税收，将直接卸载Rafael以削减价格。 “购买低，卖得很高，这是游戏的名称，”拉法埃尔说。</p><p>  Things were going well until his enterprise went bust—one source says his partner ran off with the company cash—and he had to start over. In the spring of 1980—with three trucks to his name and a $5,000 loan—he launched Carlos Seafood, the same company he runs today. He bragged that he would work three days straight without sleeping. “I needed toothpicks to keep my eyes open,” he later said. He eventually broke into the old boys’ network that controlled access to the city auction. After six months, he had $250,000 cash in his hands. He built a 10-bedroom house and bought his first two fishing vessels.</p><p>  事情顺利进展顺利，直到他的企业走过胸部 - 一个来源说，他的伴侣用公司现金跑了下来，他必须重新开始。在1980年春天 - 用三辆卡车到他的名字和5,000美元的贷款 - 他推出的卡洛斯海鲜，同一家他今天跑的公司。他吹嘘他将在没有睡觉的情况下直接工作三天。 “我需要牙签，让我的眼睛睁开，”他后来说。他最终被闯入了控制着城市拍卖的老男孩的网络。六个月后，他手中有250,000美元的现金。他建造了一个10卧室的房子，买了前两个渔船。</p><p> In those days, the city auction, which started with a bell at 8:00 a.m. and ended 22 minutes later, was a circus. The boats all went for bidding simultaneously, and the entire boatload would end up—sight unseen—at the docks of the winner, where they could be unloaded. The auction rewarded enthusiasm and social status rather than hard numbers. Typically, an established buyer would get an auctioneer’s attention and bark out prices per pound for each species on a particular boat. The auctioneer then scribbled the prices down on a chalkboard along with the bidder’s initials.</p><p> 在那些日子里，城市拍卖会在上午8点开始举办钟声并结束22分钟后，是一个马戏团。船只都同时竞标，整个船载将在胜利者的码头上结束看不见，在那里他们可以卸下。拍卖会奖励热情和社会地位，而不是艰难的数字。通常情况下，建立的买方将获得拍卖师的注意力，并为特定船上的每种物种吠叫每种物种的价格。然后拍卖师随后将价格汇总在黑板上以及投标人的首字母。</p><p> When subsequent buyers shouted out competing bids, the first bidder could defend it by shouting “10”—a tenth of a cent increase. This system made it tricky for upstarts to get in on the action, but Rafael found he could bid a whopping price for one species on a particular boat to get his letter—C—on the board. Then, he could lowball the rest of the haul. “Carlos was good at elbowing the other guys and yelling loudly to get the boats,” says Armando Estudante, a retired fisherman who was friendly with Rafael in those days.</p><p> 当随后的买家喊出竞标时，第一个投标人可以通过喊“10”来保护它，第十次提高十分之一。这个系统使提升者令人棘手进入行动，但拉斐尔发现他可以在特定船上投标一个物种的往往的价格，以便在董事会上获取他的信-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-on。然后，他可以在剩下的剩下的剩余时间。 “卡洛斯擅长肘击另一个人，大声大声喊叫，以获得船只，”那些与拉斐尔友好的退役渔民，在那些日子里友好的亚马逊·伊斯坦德。</p><p> Because the auction prices were nonbinding, when the boat unloaded at Rafael’s dock, he would complain about the quality of the fish and haggle like no one else. By that point, it was too late or too much of a hassle for the captain to find a new buyer. “I didn’t steal it from anybody,” Rafael said in the oral history. “Maybe I hustled a lot of fishermen down there, y’know wheelin’ and dealin’, but shame on them if they didn’t know better.” Some fishermen got smart and refused to sell to him. “No ‘C’” the auctioneer would write under their boats. Felicio Lourenço, who died in 2008, was once so angry about being manipulated that he allegedly pulled a gun on Rafael.</p><p> 因为拍卖价格不贴为，当船在Rafael的码头卸下时，他会抱怨鱼的质量和别人没有其他人。到那一点，为队长找到一个新买家来说太晚了或太多了。 “我没有从任何人那里偷取它，”拉斐尔在口头历史中说道。 “也许我在那里掏出了很多渔民，你知道的'和dealin'，但如果他们不知道更好，就会羞辱他们。”有些渔民有聪明，拒绝向他销售。 “拍卖师不会在他们的船下写下。 2008年死亡的FelicioLourenço曾经生气则为被操纵，他据称他在Rafael上拿着枪。</p><p> Rafael’s first serious brush with the law came in 1984. He hadn’t been paying his taxes: he figured the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) could wait while he grew his company. The government disagreed. He spent four and a half months in federal prison for tax evasion and said he had to pay $750,000 for back taxes and penalties when he was released. “As I was paying them off, I was still making extra money,” he boasted. At its peak, Carlos Seafood was processing on the order of 10 million kilograms of fish per year, estimates Eric Nunes, who ran a competing company in New Bedford, Sea View Fillet Company.</p><p> Rafael的第一个严肃的刷子与法律进行了1984年。他还没有支付税款：他讨论了内部收入服务（IRS）可以在他公司成长时等待。政府不同意。他在联邦监狱中花了四个半月的逃税，并表示他不得不在被释放时支付750,000美元的税收和处罚。 “当我付出的时候，我仍然赚了额外的钱，”他吹嘘。在其高峰期，卡洛斯海​​鲜每年加工1000万公斤鱼类，估计埃里克尼斯，他在新贝德福德的竞争公司乘坐竞争公司。 </p><p>  Throughout the 1980s, New Bedford fishermen became notorious for poaching Canadian fish. To settle a long-running territorial dispute, in 1984, the International Court of Justice in The Hague drew a line down the center of Georges Bank, which effectively gave the Canadians three-quarters of the cod fishery. “They took the richest fishing grounds away from our boats,” says Nunes, who left the business in the late 1990s.</p><p>整个20世纪80年代，新的贝德福德渔民对偷奏的加拿大鱼变得臭名昭着。为了解决一个漫长的领土纠纷，1984年，海牙国际法院沿着乔治银行的中心划线，有效地给了加拿大人四分之三的鳕鱼渔业。 “他们将最富有的渔场从我们的船上带走，”在20世纪90年代末离开了这项业务的金枪鱼说。</p><p> When Canadian officials chased after the pirate fishing vessels, the crew would form a human chain on deck to guard the engine room from gunfire. Then, they’d drop their pants and bend over. The Canadians arrested fishermen in their waters and seized their vessels, creating a diplomatic row with the United States.</p><p> 加拿大官员在海盗渔船后追逐时，船员将在甲板上形成一个人类链，以防止发动机室从枪声。然后，他们会摔倒裤子并弯腰。加拿大人在流域中逮捕了渔民并扣押了他们的船只，与美国建造了外交。</p><p> If the law couldn’t stop the New Bedford fishermen, nature would. In 1992, cod stocks dropped to five percent of their historical levels. In a single year, the value of the port’s seafood landings declined from $150-million to $100-million. As the industry was tanking, some of the biggest processors were caught falsely branding Canadian fish as American and selling them to the US military. There was so little fish in the 1990s that one mobster was using fishing vessels to smuggle cocaine and pot into New Bedford.</p><p> 如果法律无法阻止新的贝德福德渔民，自然会。 1992年，COD股减少到历史层面的5％。在一年中，港口海鲜着陆的价值从1.5亿美元降至1000万美元。随着行业的坦克，一些最大的处理器被摧毁了品牌的加拿大鱼作为美国人，将他们卖给美国军队。 20世纪90年代有这么小的鱼，一个流氓正在使用渔船来走私可卡因和锅中进入新的贝德福德。</p><p> Carlos Rafael, once a scrappy underdog, seized upon the tough times to invest in establishing his own fishing fleet to guarantee a steady supply of fish for the processors’ blades. He’d partner with captains and then buy them out when they retired or got fed up with his verbal abuse. Jose Farias, a Portuguese welder who was a co-owner of Rafael’s boats for seven years, says that, strangely enough, when he sold his share to Rafael in 2007, he wasn’t one cent richer. “I don’t make no money,” he told me over the phone in broken English. “He’s the one who do all the paperwork. He go to office and do the settlements.”</p><p> Carlos Rafael曾经是一个陷入困境的失败者，抓住艰难时期，投资于建立自己的钓鱼船队，以保证处理器刀片的稳定供应鱼。他与船长合作，然后在退休或厌倦了他的口头虐待时购买了他们。曾经是Rafael船只七年的共同主的葡萄牙焊机何塞法利亚说，奇怪的是，当他在2007年卖给Rafael时，他并不富裕。 “我没有钱，”他通过手机以破碎的英语告诉我。 “他是那个完成所有文书工作的人。他去办公室并做出决定。“</p><p>  Pissing people off was the collateral damage of Rafael’s greed. He began treating the docks as his personal shipyard, leaving derelict vessels hanging around for years. When harbor personnel tried to get him to move a boat to make room for another fisherman, Rafael threatened their lives, according to two sources who declined to be named for fear of retaliation. “I’ll grab you by the neck and throw you down these stairs,” he told one fisherman, according to a source. “I’ll throw you in the water and when you try to climb up, I’ll hold your head down,” he allegedly told another. Rafael never followed through on any of these threats, but they nonetheless left their recipients shaken.</p><p>  撒尿的人是拉斐尔贪婪的抵押伤害。他开始将码头视为他的私人造船厂，留下了持续多年的遗弃船只。当涉及被拒绝报复时的两个来源，拉斐尔威胁着他们的生活，当港口人员试图让他搬到另一艘船，威胁他们的生活。 “我会在脖子上抓住你的楼梯，”他告诉一位渔夫，根据一个来源。 “我会把你扔进水中，当你试图爬上时，我会抓住你的头，”他据称告诉他人。拉斐尔从未跟随任何这些威胁，但他们仍然离开了他们的收件人。</p><p> In 2002, when the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began an effort to remove nine sunken ships from the harbor floor as part of a Superfund cleanup, Rafael had a leaky fishing vessel— Just a Girl—tied up in the Herman Melville Shipyard with a pump running every couple of days to keep it afloat. Rather than move his boat so that the EPA could complete its work, he allowed it to sink and let the government deal with the added cleanup. When the EPA sent him the bill, he sued and lost.</p><p> 2002年，当美国环境保护局（EPA）开始努力去除港口楼的九次凹陷，作为超级清理的一部分，Rafael有一个漏水的渔船 - 只是一个在赫尔曼梅尔维尔造船厂的女孩捆绑一个泵运行每天的时间，以保持漂浮。而不是移动他的船，以便EPA可以完成其工作，他允许它下沉并让政府处理补充的清理。当EPA派遣他的账单时，他起诉和丢失了。</p><p> A few years later, a 38-year-old dockworker named Jose Baptista died of carbon-monoxide fumes while working below deck on Rafael’s boat the  Sandra-Lee. Rafael  told the  Standard-Times that he felt awful about it. “It’s beyond our control,” he said. When the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigated, he refused to answer their questions on the advice of his lawyer. The agency later fined him $46,000 for negligence.</p><p> 几年后，一位38岁的码头名叫何塞·巴尔蒂斯塔在Rafael的船上工作的碳水化合物下面工作时死于甲板上。拉斐尔告诉标准时代，他对它感到痛苦。 “它超出了我们的控制，”他说。当美国职业安全和健康管理局调查时，他拒绝回答他们对律师建议的问题。原子能机构后来罚款46,000美元的疏忽。 </p><p> It’s hard to say exactly when the man who started his career as a fish cutter became The Codfather. Was it in 1995, when he beat federal charges of price-fixing? Was it in 1995, when he bought three scallop boats when the fishery had collapsed and made a killing when it opened up again the next year? Or was it in 1999, when he was arrested for lying to authorities about his fishing history in order to get special permits for squid and black sea bass?</p><p>当作为鱼切割机开始职业生涯的人成为决心时，很难说。是1995年，当他击败了价格的联邦指控？ 1995年，当渔业崩溃并在明年再次开放时，他买了三艘扇贝船只？或者在1999年被捕，因为他被捕到当局有关他的渔业历史，以便获得鱿鱼和黑海低音的特殊许可？</p><p> “I am a pirate,” Rafael  told regulators during a federal fisheries management meeting, “It’s your job to catch me.” Over two decades, he racked up more than half a million dollars in fines for more than 30 federal fishing violations. His boats have been cited for overfishing, failing to throw back undersized fish and lobsters bearing eggs, having boats with secret coolers in them, blocking coast guard inspectors from boarding, failing to declare fishing trips, and filing false reports on his catch. For Rafael, it was just the cost of doing business.</p><p> “我是海盗，”拉斐尔在联邦渔业管理会议期间告诉监管机构，“这是你抓住我的工作。”超过二十年，他在30多百万美元的罚款中超过了超过30万美元的联邦捕鱼违规行为。他的船被引用了过度捕捞，未能抛弃患有鸡蛋的漏洞，其中船上有秘密冷却器，阻挡海岸警卫队检查员从登机，未能宣布钓鱼旅行，并在他的捕获中提交错误报告。对于拉斐尔，这只是做生意的成本。</p><p>  A couple of years ago, when the US Coast Guard boarded Rafael’s boat the  Bulldog in the Gulf of Maine, the trawl winch began unspooling, sending the net plunging into the ocean and out of sight. The feds suspected the winch brake had been released on purpose. They later retrieved the net and discovered it had an illegal liner designed to prevent undersized fish from slipping through the regulation mesh. The case is under investigation and the captain declined to comment for this article on the advice of his lawyer.</p><p>  几年前，当美国海岸警卫队登上Rafael的船在缅因州湾的斗牛犬时，拖网绞车开始了未用植，将净灌注进入海洋，看不见。联邦调查局涉嫌绞车制动器已释放出于目的。他们后来检索了网络并发现了它有一个非法衬里，旨在防止口径的鱼从调节网中滑动。案件正在调查，船长拒绝评论本文就律师的建议。</p><p> Alan Sherman, who has captained another Rafael boat,  Resolute, for six years, says Rafael doesn’t meddle with his fishing and he doesn’t meddle with Rafael’s shoreside business. When Sherman doesn’t like something Rafael has to say, he’s willing to push back. “That’s the trouble with some of these guys that have worked for him,” he says. “They’re afraid of him.” And just as fishermen are afraid of Rafael, they’re also afraid for their future.</p><p> 艾伦·谢尔曼（Alan Sherman）曾举办了另一艘Rafael船，六年的六年，Rafael不会与他的钓鱼干涉，他不会干涉Rafael的Sporeside业务。当谢尔曼不喜欢拉斐尔的东西时，他愿意推回来。 “这是一个为他工作的一些人的麻烦，”他说。 “他们害怕他。”就像渔民害怕拉斐尔一样，他们也害怕他们的未来。</p><p>  One morning last summer, I stop by Bergie’s Seafood, a small fish house on the waterfront frequented by fishermen who don’t want to sell at an auction dominated by Rafael. After passing through a vinyl curtain into the cool warehouse, I tiptoe around puddles of water on the concrete floor to the carpeted side office and find David Stanley, the vice president of vessel operations, sitting at a computer. “What Carlos did affects the whole industry,” he says bitterly. “Gives us all a big, fat black eye.” If he’s angry at Rafael, he’s even angrier at the federal government for letting the fishing business collapse. “We got fucked,” he says.</p><p>  去年夏天的一天早上，我停在Bergie的海鲜，在江边的小鱼屋，凡经常被渔民在由Rafael主导的拍卖中销售。经过乙烯基窗帘进入凉爽的仓库后，我脚尖周围的水泥水坑在水泥地板上到地毯的旁边办公室，找到船只运营副总裁大卫斯坦利，坐在电脑上。 “卡洛斯做了什么影响整个行业，”他痛苦地说道。 “给我们所有大脂肪的黑眼睛。”如果他对拉斐尔生气，他甚至在联邦政府甚至是渔业崩溃的愤怒。 “我们搞砸了，”他说。</p><p> In 2010, New England fisheries shifted to a catch shares management system—a kind of cap and trade for fish, where a fisherman or group of fishermen is secured a share of the annual catch. These shares are based on each fisherman’s catch history. The system was supposed to help fishermen avoid a frenzy of competition at the start of each season. They’d be able to fish smarter and reduce the amount of by-catch thrown overboard. But the system has been hamstrung by the uneven recovery of fish stocks.</p><p> 2010年，新英格兰渔业转移到渔业股份管理系统 - 一种渔业股票和贸易，其中渔民或一群渔民被占年度渔获量的份额。这些股票基于每个渔民的捕获历史。该系统应该帮助渔民在每个赛季开始时避免狂热的竞争。他们能够越来越聪明，减少逐个捕获的落水量。但该系统因鱼类股票的不均匀恢复而陷入困境。</p><p> In 2016, the New England fleet was allowed to catch more than 50,000 tonnes of haddock, but they could only bring up about 1,000 tonnes of cod in the process. They also had to avoid two overfished species of flatfish—American plaice and witch flounder. If an individual fisherman brought up more than his or her share of these species, he or she could buy pricey allocations from other fishermen. But once the fishery-wide quota for any single stock was met, the entire groundfishery came to a halt. In 2015, US fishermen left 76 percent of their haddock quota—worth more than $100-million wholesale—in the ocean.</p><p> 2016年，允许新英格兰舰队捕获超过50,000吨的海岸，但它们只能在该过程中提出约1000吨COD。他们还必须避免两种溢出的扁平鱼类普遍存在的物种和巫婆比目鱼。如果一个单独的渔民比他的这些物种的份额更多，他或她可以从其他渔民购买昂贵的拨款。但是，一旦遇到任何单一股票的渔业范围的配额，整个地下杂志都停止了。 2015年，美国渔民留下了76％的海拔配额，价值超过1000万美元的批发在海洋中。 </p><p>   Catch shares, however, were working swimmingly for Rafael, who said he had accumulated 60 permits and stacked them onto 15 active vessels. He was a pathological whiner, however. He told the press he was tired of paying taxes and angry that Massachusetts had singled him out in restricting a federal aid fund for the troubled fishing industry. In early 2015, he announced that he planned to sell off all his boats and move to Cape Verde, a former Portuguese colony off the coast of Africa. “I’m gonna cash in and screw,” he  said. Some thought he was just puffing himself up. But he was serious.</p><p>然而，抓住股票正在为拉斐尔游泳，他说他已经积累了60份允许并将它们堆积在15个活跃的船上。然而，他是一种病理抱怨。他告诉媒体他厌倦了税收和愤怒的愤怒，马萨诸塞州已经在限制陷入困境的渔业的联邦援助基金中单挑了他。在2015年初，他宣布他计划在非洲海岸的前葡萄牙殖民地卖给佛得角，搬到佛得角。 “我要兑现坚持，”他说。有些人认为他只是喘不过气来。但他很认真。</p><p> Soon after, a pair of Russian immigrants with sketchy backgrounds reached out to him through a broker and paid a visit to his office that June. Rafael told them he wanted $175-million for the business, but, according to his financial statements, its assets only amounted to $21-million and it was just bringing in between $3- and $4-million in revenue each year.</p><p> 不久之后，一对俄罗斯移民与粗略背景通过经纪人伸出援手，并参观他的办公室。拉斐尔告诉他们，他希望为这项业务提供1.75亿美元，但是，根据他的财务报表，其资产仅为2100万美元，每年才达到3亿美元至4000万美元。</p><p>  Rafael pulled a ledger from his desk with the word “cash” on the front. “We are profitable,” he told them. “You will not see it on paper for Carlos Seafood.”</p><p>  拉斐尔从桌子上拉了一个分类帐，前面的“现金”一词。 “我们是有利可图的，”他告诉他们。 “你不会在Carlos Seafood纸上看到它。”</p><p> While he was claiming a loss of almost half a million that year, he showed them he brought in an extra $600,000 in cash in just six months. Every day he had a boat come into port, he was sending his fish to Michael Perretti, a convicted felon who ran South Street Seafoods in New York, and Perretti was sending him “jingles”—cash—that he was flying back to Portugal.</p><p> 虽然他声称近五十百万年的损失，但他向他们展示了他只在六个月内以600,000美元的现金带来。每天他都有一艘船进入港口，他正在向纽约跑南街海鲜的被定罪的重群岛送他的鱼到迈克尔佩里，而Perretti则派他“杰尔” - 他飞回葡萄牙。</p><p> At that moment, Rafael seemed to realize what he was admitting to the two strangers. “You could be the IRS in here. This could be a clusterfuck. So I’m trusting you. The only thing is, I open myself because both of you is Russians and I don’t think they would have two Russians. Fuck me—that would be some bad luck!”</p><p> 那一刻，拉斐尔似乎意识到他对这两个陌生人承认的内容。 “你可以成为这里的美国国税局。这可能是一个群集。所以我相信你。唯一的是，我打开自己，因为你们两个都是俄罗斯人，我认为他们没有两个俄罗斯人。操我 - 那将是一个不好的运气！“</p><p> In fact, the two Rus</p><p> 事实上，两个rus</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hakaimagazine.com/features/last-trial-codfather/">https://www.hakaimagazine.com/features/last-trial-codfather/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/codfather/">#codfather</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/trial/">#trial</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/拉斐尔/">#拉斐尔</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
