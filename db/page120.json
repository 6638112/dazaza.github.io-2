"note_en": "Instructure, the company that develops the learning management system Canvas, has filed with the Securities Exchange Commission for an initial public offering, the company announced Monday.\n The private equity firm Thoma Bravo, which focuses on technology companies,  acquired Instructure in March 2020 for $2 billion, removing it from public trade as schools and universities shuttered due to the coronavirus pandemic and moved to online learning platforms.\n For the first three months of 2021, Instructure reported  $94 million in revenue and a net loss of $33.1 million. The company\u2019s prospectus asserts that online learning will become a permanent part of education and that federal relief funding will contribute to further investment in edtech.\n \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has created a set of conditions in which students of all ages have been learning remotely for a year, providing an opportunity to demonstrate the efficacy of distance learning at scale and opening up new possibilities for learners who previously could not access quality education,\u201d  the filing reads. \u201cAlmost overnight, schools and universities had to rapidly adopt or redeploy online platforms for students and teachers to conduct lessons remotely. As a result of government stimulus and realigned school and university budget priorities, hardware, software, and internet connectivity began to proliferate in regions and markets with historically low levels of access. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a massive tailwind to adoption over the past year, but the need for ongoing technology in education will persist well beyond the pandemic.\u201d\n Instructure serves more than 6,000 customers worldwide. Its learning management system, Canvas, passed more than 30 million K-12 and university users in 2020, according to the filing.\n Despite the widespread use of Instructure\u2019s technology, executives warn in the prospectus that the company could face significant challenges in the coming months, such as possible reversals of new business initiated during the pandemic.\n \u201cWe have a history of losses, and we do not expect to be profitable for the foreseeable future,\u201d the prospectus reads.\n It lists net losses by Instructure of $80.2 million in 2019 and $200.2 million in 2020.\n The filing says that Instructure, since being acquired, is now focusing primarily on education, citing its sale of Bridge, which catered to corporate learning. Instructure sold Bridge for $50 million, EdSurge reported.\n Since being acquired by Thomas Bravo, Instructure in December acquired Certica Analytics, an education analytics provider.

He said ShipBob had between 1,200 and 1,500 customers on its platform as it entered 2020.

", "note_en": "The round was co-led by Fireside Ventures (a prominent Indian investor in consumer and hardware tech space) and an unnamed global investor, the Indian startup said, without revealing the other firm\u2019s name. HeyDay, PDS International, Class 5 Global, Secocha Ventures, and founders of  hardware startup boAt (Aman Gupta and Sameer Mehta) also participated in the round. It\u2019s not clear whether the round also includes debt \u2014 as is popular among Thrasio-like ventures \u2014 and if the entire financing is being wired in one tranche.\n 10club acquires small brands that sell their products on e-commerce platforms and scales those businesses.\n  \u201cGreat businesses are growing on the backs of e-commerce giants like Amazon, Flipkart, Nykaa and more. They get their foundational years right but find it difficult to scale, and understand that competition is hard to curb.That\u2019s where we step in, allowing you \u2013 the entrepreneurs \u2013 to enjoy an exit and benefit from years of hard work,\u201d the startup describes on its LinkedIn page.\n 10club is one of a few dozen firms that is  attempting to replicate what is popularly known as the Thrasio-model in India. Mensa Brands, a similar venture by former fashion e-commerce Myntra chief executive, recently raised $50 million in equity and debt. TechCrunch  reported earlier this month that UpScale, another prominent player in this space, is in advanced talks with Germany\u2019s Razor Group to raise capital.\n Pity the folks at Thrasio that must be scratching their heads wondering why they&#39;re getting so many hits/mentions from India.  https://t.co/N9r2JYWCyp\n Like Thrasio, several of these firms are trying to acquire brands that sell mid-range to high-end products in categories where competition is limited. In fact, some of the categories that are common among these brands are so under-appreciated that even Amazon and other e-commerce firms have not explored them through their private label ecosystems.\n New York-headquartered Thrasio, which has raised over $1.3 billion in equity and debt since December last year, had acquired or otherwise  consolidated about 6,000 third party sellers on Amazon as of earlier this year.\n \u201cIndia and online-first brands are at the cusp of the next revolution. We, at Fireside, believe that both VC and acquisition driven model will co-exist going forward and can turbocharge the growth of early-stage brands. Together with the team at 10Club, we will be able to drive this change and enable e-commerce entrepreneurs to realize the full potential of their brands,\u201d said Vinay Singh, Partner at Fireside Ventures, in a statement. As part of the deal, Singh is also joining 10club\u2019s board.\n Bhavna Suresh, co-founder of 10club and former chief executive of real-estate marketplace Lamudi, said the startup has already built its foundational pillars of the centralized platform and signed letters of intent worth $15 million from several firms and will deploy the fresh capital to operate the new businesses.\n &#34;Thrasio

", "note_en": "Workforce analytics company Visier has secured $154 million CAD ($125 million USD), becoming the latest Canadian tech startup to surpass a $1 billion valuation.\n The all equity, Series E round was sole-sourced from Goldman Sachs Asset Management and brings Visier\u2019s valuation to $1.2 billion CAD ($1 billion USD).\n  An already profitable company with a healthy bottom line, Visier raised the capital after Goldman Sachs expressed interest in helping the startup optimize for companies facing new human resource (HR) challenges coming out of COVID-19.\n Visier is a Vancouver-based startup that offers cloud-based workforce analytics software. Its tech helps companies build programs and plans focused on employee wellness, retention, and more. The startup was founded in 2010 and currently serves around 8,000 customers, including the likes of Adobe, Bridgestone, Electronic Arts, McKesson, and Uber. Visier is available in more than 75 countries.\n It was created by Ryan Wong (CEO), John Schwarz (chairman), Jan Schwarz, and Brett Schwarz. John Schwarz began his career at IBM, later becoming president of Symantec (now NortonLifeLock). He also led Business Objects, which was acquired by SAP. It was there he worked with Wong, who focused on engineering at both Business Objects and SAP after the merger.\n This Series E capital brings Visier\u2019s total funding to date to $270 million CAD ( $219.5 million USD). Visier\u2019s past investors include Summit Partners, Foundation Capital, Adams Street Partners, BYU Cougar Capital, and Sorenson Capital.\n  In addition to the $154 million in primary capital, Goldman Sachs also bought out around $92 million CAD ($75 million USD) from existing investors. CEO Wong declined to disclose the details of that deal.\n \u201cAccess to information about employees and the health of an organization has never been more critical,\u201d said Holger Staude, managing director within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with Visier at this pivotal moment and support the company\u2019s continued growth.\u201d\n Visier plans to use the capital to ensure it can win big in what it sees as a \u201cswift and massive transformation\u201d occurring in the HR space. Visier sees two major trends in the HR sector: an increased demand placed on organizations to \u201cbetter know, care for, and support their employees\u201d and the need for new recruitment strategies as COVID-19 has created a more distributed workforce.\n \u201cWhen the pandemic is over, the surveys are saying that there will be a change in the workforce,\u201d Wong said in an interview. \u201cI think that turnover is as high as between 25 to 40 percent.\u201d\n \u201cI think it will be headline news that companies will finally wake up in the morning and find they [have lost] that percentage of their workforce,\u201d the CEO added. \u201cAnd it is a real problem. [Visier has] been beating that drum, and telling and warning that is coming because of all the data that we\u2019re seeing.\u201d\n \u201cThis whole returning to work is not going to be smooth sailing,\u201d he lamented.\n  The workforce analytics market Visier operates in is expected to reach $5.97 billion USD globally by 2026.  Reports show a surge in investment in workforce analytics from multinational companies and note the demand for workforce analytics software surged during the pandemic, as companies look for ways to ensure productive and efficient management of the workforce amid remote and hybrid work models.\n Companies have been increasingly announcing new hybrid or remote work models, including Shopify, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, PayPal, and Salesforce, which declared the  nine to five workday \u201cdead.\u201d\n Wong pointed to how companies being more willing to hire remote workers can create new challenges as much as it creates new opportunities and access to talent.\n \u201cThe whole recruiting and where we hire has changed completely,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, companies that have a workforce planning or talent strategy on where they recruit and how they actually retain talent and assume the classic way of working [will continue], they will be in shock.\u201d\n In addition to changes brought about by COVID-19, Wong also sees a shift in overall employee culture over the past year, led by social movements. He sees employees demanding more than their employers when it comes to addressing social issues, internally and externally.\n \u201cThe last year, the whole pandemic and the whole social movement, has brought a different contract between employer employees.\u201d\n \u201cIn the last 25 years, organizations were very much about profit and loss (P&amp;L),\u201d Wong said. \u201cI think the next 25 years is more than just P&amp;L. It is not acceptable to be just looking at P&amp;L, the social responsibility [expectations] that organizations will put in, by law and by the employee pressure, is very high. The last year, the whole pandemic and the whole social movement, has brought a different contract between employer employees.\u201d\n Many companies, especially in the tech space, have seen employees demanding action on diversity and inclusion and holding their employers more accountable for actions across a wide spectrum of issues. A homegrown example is  Shopify, which has faced long-standing criticisms over some of its company policies.\n \u201cThe partnership with Goldman Sachs on the next phase of Visier\u2019s growth underscores the fact that people analytics has become mainstream business practice,\u201d said Visier chairman John Schwarz. \u201cThis investment is key to establishing Visier as the independent global cloud platform for people related business insights.\u201d\n Visier, a company of more than 400 employees, is looking to use part of the funding to grow its own employee base, globally. The startup plans to hire around 100 workers in the next 12 months and may look to create a Toronto base in addition to its Vancouver headquarters.\n One major use for the Goldman capital will be to create a partner ecosystem within Visier\u2019s existing platform. This is something the company had been working on prior to the Series E round but the launch of which has been accelerated by the injection of capital. Visier plans to launch the platform this summer.\n Visier also plans to make acquisitions using its newfound capital, something that has not been part of its strategy in the past.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:19:41", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5f00\u53d1,\u8f6f\u4ef6,\u52b3\u52a8\u529b,cad,visier", "title": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e91\u7684\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5206\u6790\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684Visier\uff0c\u4eceGoldman Sachs\u83b7\u5f9715400\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684CAD\u7cfb\u5217E\uff0c\u4ee51.2\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684CAD\u4f30\u4ef7 ", "title_en": "Visier, which develops cloud-based workforce analytics software, raises $154M CAD Series E from Goldman Sachs at a $1.2B CAD valuation", "transed": 1, "url": "https://betakit.com/workforce-analytics-startup-visier-secures-154-million-cad-from-goldman-sachs/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5f00\u53d1", "\u8f6f\u4ef6", "\u52b3\u52a8\u529b", "cad", "visier"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "3c56705dcd8765a269238027d3bed46a.jpg", "infoid": 1068562, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u65b0\u52a0\u5761/\u66fc\u8c376\u670828\u65e5\uff08\u8def\u900f\u793e\uff09\n \u6cf0\u56fd\u4fdd\u7687\u515a\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bb6\u8096\u514b\u6d1b\u5fb7\uff06\uff0334;

Chuenchoopol told Reuters he and a team of 80 volunteers had created the maps and planned to report everyone named on them to police on accusations of insulting the monarchy.\n A spokesperson for Alphabet&#39;s Google  (GOOGL.O) said by email &#34;the issue is now fixed&#34;, and noted: &#34;We have clear policies about what&#39;s acceptable for user generated My Maps content. We remove user generated maps that violate our policies.&#34;\n A version of one of the maps seen by Reuters included the names and addresses of nearly 500 people, many of them students, together with their photos in university or high school uniforms. It had received over 350,000 views.\n The faces of those named had been covered by black squares with the number 112, in reference to the article under the country&#39;s criminal code which makes insulting or defaming the monarchy punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\n  Songklod said that he and the team of volunteers sought to highlight those they accused of breaking that law.\n &#34;When each of us sees something offensive posted on social media, we put it on the map,&#34; he said. Describing it as a &#34;psychological&#34; warfare operation, Songklod said the aim was to dissuade people from online criticism of the monarchy.\n Youth-led protests that began last year brought unprecedented criticism of the monarchy and calls for its reform both on the streets and online.\n The government did not immediately respond to comment on the removal of the Google Maps or the content they contained.\n Songklod, 54, a retired army captain and prominent right-wing activist, said he considered the operation targeting opponents of the monarchy a &#34;massive success&#34; despite the removal of the maps.\n  Human rights groups and critics of the establishment said the maps included the private data and addresses of hundreds of people and could put them at risk of violence.\n &#34;I started to get panicked messages from young people in Thailand who had been doxxed in a royalist document on Google Maps accusing them of being anti-monarchy,&#34; said Andrew MacGregor Marshall, a Scotland-based critic of the monarchy and one of the earliest to highlight the existence of the maps.\n &#34;It\u2019s clear that young Thai people who just want democracy are facing worsening risks.&#34;\n Reporting by Fanny Potkin in Singapore and Panu Wongcha-um in Bangkok, additional reporting by Jessie Pang; Editing by Matthew Tostevin and Alison Williams", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:19:25", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "google,\u8c37\u6b4c,\u8868\u793a,removed,\u5730\u56fe", "title": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u5220\u9664\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u5217\u51fa\u4e86\u6570\u767e\u540d\u6cf0\u56fd\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bb6\u7684\u540d\u79f0\u548c\u5730\u5740\u88ab\u6307\u8d23\u5bf9\u65b9\u7684\u541b\u4e3b\u5236 ", "title_en": "Google says it removed two user-generated maps that listed names and addresses of hundreds of Thai activists accused of opposing the monarchy", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/google-takes-down-maps-targeting-hundreds-thais-accused-opposing-king-2021-06-28/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["google", "\u8c37\u6b4c", "\u8868\u793a", "removed", "\u5730\u56fe"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7aa6ffe3cc64f79984b9637328856626.jpg", "infoid": 1068561, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "4G\u4e34\u5e8a\u521b\u5efa\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ee5\u8fd0\u884c\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u540e\u7aef\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5c06\u60a3\u8005\u968f\u673a\u5316\u5165\u6cbb\u7597\u548c\u5b89\u6170\u5242\u7ec4\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u836f\u7269\u548c\u5b89\u6170\u5242\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u90a3\u4e9b\u5e93\u5b58\u4e2d\u7684\u836f\u7269\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u81f3\u5c11\u5728\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u836f\u7269\u9001\u7ed9\u60a3\u8005\u3002\u6240\u6709\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u90fd\u5c5e\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u8bd5\u7528\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u4f1e\uff0c\u6216\u77ed\u6682\u7684RTSM\u3002\n \u5177\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c4G\u4e34\u5e8a\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u79f0\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u7ba1\u7406\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8981\u6c42\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u957f\u671f\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6587\u6863\u7f16\u5199\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u914d\u7f6e\u4e3a\u5e73\u53f0\u3002\n  \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5242\u91cf\u4ece\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u6700\u5feb\u901f\u5ea6\u4e3a6\u5929 -

That means randomizing patients into treatment and placebo groups, locating medicines and placebos, keeping the supply of those medicines stocked, and, at least during the pandemic, delivering those medicines to patients. All of these tasks fall under the umbrella of Randomized Trial Supply Management, or RTSM for short.\n Specifically, 4G Clinical\u2019s software, called Prancer, uses natural language processing to take specific requirements needed to manage a clinical trial, which are often written in long, complex documents, and configures them into a platform.\n  The fastest the company has been able to move from a phone call to the first dose in a clinical trial was 6 days \u2013\u00a0a sprint that created the software needed for a COVID-19 study during the pandemic. That was an exceptionally fast case, but in general, 4G Clinical says it can beat standard timelines by considerable margins.\n \u201cMost vendors in the world would say that they are probably, you know, between 10 and 16 weeks from, you know, from the kicking off a study until they can dose a patient,\u201d says Dave Kelleher, a company co-founder. \u201cOur typical timeline is generally four to six weeks post spec signature.\u201d\n Generally, large pharmaceutical companies are capable of creating these trial management systems internally. Small companies, however, may not have the capability to do so. 4G Clinical goal is to provide a service that can be of use to both. 4G Clinical has currently designed systems for over 230 companies \u2013\u00a0though the company would not disclose the specific trials in which its systems are being used.\n  4G clinical is also announcing over $200 million in a growth equity round led by Goldman Sachs. Before Goldman, the primary investment came from Boston-based Schooner Capital and First Analysis, a VC firm out of Chicago.\n Kelleher declined to say what the plans for the round were, other than company has plans to pursue more go-to-market strategies and R&amp;D, and ultimately aims to \u201ctake up as much air\u201d in the eClinical and RTSM space as possible.\n The eClinical market is expected to reach about   $14.7 billion by 2027 . RTSM made up about 17 percent of market share in 2020. With the complexity of clinical trials increasing, and the number of trials growing \u2013\u00a0even after COVID-19 related issues shut many trials down in 2020 \u2013 there may be room for more growth.\n Before COVID-19, there was evidence that the amount of clinical trials had   steadily been increasing . In 2000, there were 2,119 clinical trials registered at Clinicaltrials.gov. By 2010, 100,208, and by 2020, 362,532 registered by the end of the year (that includes massive slowdowns created by the pandemic for non-COVID research).\n Within that landscape, there is some evidence that sponsors of clinical trials are using more external applications to manage those clinical trials. Of 500 clinical operations professionals respondents   surveyed  by Veeva (another eClinical company, keep in mind) found that 63 percent were using an RTSM system, up from about 43 percent in 2017.\n 4G Clinical, generally, is looking to benefit from the increased public attention to the clinical trials process, and the flexibility that the pandemic has created for sponsors to get creative with clinical trial designs.\n The pandemic did encourage some innovation in this regard. Take, for example, the World Health Organization\u2019s SOLIDARITY trial, which used an adaptive trial design in which multiple drugs could be tested at once. Drugs that showed no promise mid-way through the trial could be dropped (as hydroxychloroquine was in June 2020). The adaptive part, in short, allows for mid-trial tweaks.\n It\u2019s not the traditional design of the gold-standard randomized controlled clinical trial, but it did glean a significant amount of knowledge in a short period of time.   After seven months , three of four drugs tested showed no effect on mortality, whereas the fifth remdesivir, showed some limited promise.\n  Adaptive trial designs weren\u2019t unheard of before the pandemic \u2013\u00a0the FDA had actually released guidance on adaptive clinical trials   in 2019 . But the post-pandemic landscape might encourage more flexibility in this regard, and with it, increase a need for software that can be tweaked to accommodate such changes.\n \u201cI think that we saw some regulatory hurdles reduced as part of this process that allows for more creativity in study design,\u201d says Kelleher. \u201cProbably the most important thing for us is our flexibility, we can make changes to studies very rapidly \u2013\u00a0to live studies.\u201d\n 4G Clinical and other RTSM software like it, are looking to hone tools that already exist within clinical trials \u2013\u00a0specifically software used to actually run them. It\u2019s an area of research that the team itself has both a personal stake in, and strong industry knowledge.\n Kelleher was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis at the age of 23 (a disease to which there is still no definitive cure), and previously founded the Portland-based ACME business consulting. His co-founder Ed Tourtellotte, lost his wife to breast cancer around the same time. Neither have a background in pharmacology, but rather, the team is tackling drug development through streamlining clinical trial software.\n By contrast, other companies aim to streamline clinical trial processes through A.I-based drug target identification, an especially hype-induced area of the space in which investment quadrupled to   $13.9 billion between 2019 and 2020 . Clinical trial management software may seem more mundane, but it\u2019s still an essential part of running Phase III and most Phase II studies.\n Tourtellotte has designed bespoke software systems for major drug developers, including Pfizer\u2019s Impala system (used in 80 percent of Pfizer\u2019s clinical trials for the past 20 years, says Kelleher) and another system Trident, which was sold   to Bioclinica in 2009 \u00a0(along with Tourtoulette\u2019s company, Tourtellotte Solutions). Trident was   utilized by GlaxoSmithKlein  for clinical trials in 2010.\n At this point, the company has declined to confirm a total amount of funding, but in 2020, revenue grew 110 percent with just ten percent of its portfolio focused on COVID-19 related projects.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:19:05", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5f00\u53d1,\u8f6f\u4ef6,goldman,\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c", "title": "4G\u4e34\u5e8a\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7528\u4e8e\u7ba1\u7406\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u7531Goldman Sachs\u63d0\u9ad8200\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143 ", "title_en": "4G Clinical, which develops software to manage clinical trials, raises $200M led by Goldman Sachs", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/4g-clinicals-clinical-trial-management-software-attracts-over-200m-in-new-funding/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5f00\u53d1", "\u8f6f\u4ef6", "goldman", "\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d9370be530678a1c667467fa48442d82.jpg", "infoid": 1068560, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4ece2019\u5e74\u4e0a\u534a\u5e74\u52302020\u5e74\u4e0a\u534a\u5e74\uff0c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u4e0a\u7684\u652f\u51fa\u4ece405\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u5230520\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u589e\u52a0\u4e8628.4\uff05\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83 -

This is due, in part, to demand from markets like the Philippines, where the COVID-19 pandemic has forced business closures and quarantines, Sensor Tower noted.\n Consumer spend outside of games was driven by sports, finance, business, book and entertainment apps. Subscription-based apps in the top 100 apps (excluding games) were a large part of this spend, too, contributing $8.3 billion during the period. TikTok remained a top grossing app during the first half of 2021, followed by YouTube and regular top-earner Tinder.\n  Of course, mobile game spending continues to contribute to the largest part of the overall consumer spend, reaching $44.7 billion during the first half of the year. The App Store accounted for $26 billion of that figure, but growth slowed from 26.5% in the year-ago period to 13.5% from the first half of 2020 to the first half of 2021.\n  Top-grossing games in the first half of 2021 were, in order, Tencent\u2019s Honor of Kings ($15 billion+), PUBG Mobile (including its localized version for China, reached nearly $1.5 billion), Genshin Impact ($848 million+), Roblox and Coin Master.\n Mobile app download growth also significantly slowed in the first half of this year, the firm found.\n Last year, the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a surge of new mobile app installs around the world, as consumers looked to apps for work, school, shopping, heath, grocery and more. During the first half of 2020, app installs had jumped 25.7% year over year to reach 71.3 billion downloads. But in the first half of 2021, downloads only grew 1.7% to reach 72.5 billion installs.\n  The App Store even saw a year-over-year decline in nongame installs in the first half of 2021, dropping 10.9% to 16.3 billion from 18.3 billion in the first half of 2020. Sensor Tower believes this is reflective of the increased competition for consumer attention in markets with a high number of iOS users, like the U.S., where businesses have been reopening and in-person activities are resuming.\n Meanwhile, Google Play (nongame) installs climbed 6% in the first half of this year to 56.2 billion from the 53 billion in the first half of 2020. This could be tied to the demand for apps in markets where Android is dominant, like India, which has continued to be impacted by the pandemic. As a result, app adoption on Google Play was 3.5 times higher than on the App Store during the first half of 2021.\n  The (nongame) app with the most downloads was TikTok, which gained 384.6 million new installs during the first half of this year. But this is down by around 38% from the 619 million installs it saw during the year-ago period \u2014 a change that can be attributed to  its ban from the Indian market last year.

However, unlike ClassPass\u2019 BTC model, Gympass partners with employers who then pay a flat fee for the platform (an app) which then allows their employees to choose from several wellbeing plans that give them access to myriad in-person gyms and studios, and a directory of health apps, such as Calm. The offerings are broken up into the following categories: physical health, emotional health, nutrition and sleep.\n According to the company, in May, Gympass saw a record 4 million monthly check-ins across its network of more than 50,000 global partners. In fact, for some of the partners, usage hit above pre-COVID levels.\n  Between increased anxiety rates and documented weight gain during the pandemic, it\u2019s clear that people are eager to get active again with the hopes of improving their mental health and their waistlines.\n GymPass is the brainchild of Cesar Carvalho, a former McKinsey &amp; Company consultant in Brazil who was always on the road and yearned for a corporate wellness product that would comply with his hectic work schedule.\n  \u201cSome days I worked from home, other days I worked from the office, and then there was the time I was traveling. I could never go to the gym in one place,\u201d Carvalho told TechCrunch. \u201cI realized that my needs were the same as others,\u201d he said.\n  \u201cI\u2019m one of those crazy entrepreneurs that drops out of their MBA to start a company, but looking back now, it worked out okay,\u201d he said, later telling TechCrunch that Gympass is now in Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, the U.S., Germany, Spain, Italy, Ireland, and the U.K.\n Since its launch in S\u00e3o Paulo in 2012, the company achieved product-market fit fairly quickly, and its growth and expansion have been largely organic.\n Originally, Gympass was a BTC concept, and one of its first clients was an executive at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Brazil. He liked the product so much that he eventually said to Carvalho, \u201cCan\u2019t I communicate this to my 5000 employees in all the cities where we have offices in Brazil?\u201d With that question \u2013 and offer \u2013 Carvalho saw the need to pivot and build a B2B company.\n After only three years in Brazil, one of his biggest Brazilian clients asked Carvalho to expand to Mexico, because his company had a large presence there and he wanted to offer Gympass to its employees. And so follows most of the expansion stories.\n \u201cWe expanded to Spain, because we worked with a Spanish bank in Mexico, and they wanted their employees in Spain to have access to our product,\u201d he said.\n This round, which doubles the company\u2019s valuation to $2.2 billion, includes participation from SoftBank, General Atlantic, More Strategic Ventures, Kaszek Ventures and Valor.

The latter fund is in addition, and designed to complement, a  previously unannounced   $2.3 billion global \u201cLeaders\u201d fund that is focused on later-stage investing \u00a0that Accel closed in December.\n  Accel expects to invest in about 20 to 30 companies per fund on average, according to Partner Rich Wong. Its average investment in its growth fund will be in the $50 million to $75 million range, and $75 million and $100 million out of its global Leaders fund.\n But the firm is also still eager and \u201cexcited\u201d to incubate companies, Wong said.\n \u201cWe\u2019ll still write $500,000 to $1 million seed checks,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s important to us to work with companies from the very beginning and support them through their entire journey.\u201d\n Indeed, as TechCrunch recently reported, Accel has a history of backing companies that were previously bootstrapped (and often profitable) -\u2013 the latest example being  Lower, a Columbus, Ohio-based fintech, which just raised a  $100 million Series A.\n Interestingly, Accel is often referred to some of these companies by existing portfolio companies (also in the case of Lower, whose CEO was referred to Accel by Galileo Clay Wilkes). More often than not, companies that Accel backs out of its early-stage and growth funds are bootstrapped and located outside of Silicon Valley.\n The venture firm has long looked outside of Silicon Valley for opportunities, and has had offices not only in the Bay Area, but in London and Bangalore for years. Part of its investment thesis is to \u201cinvest early and locally,\u201d according to Wong. Examples of this philosophy include investments in companies based all over the world \u2014 from Mexico to Stockholm to Tel Aviv to Munich.\n Since the time of its last fund closure in 2019, the firm has seen 10 portfolio companies go public, including  Slack, Austin-based Bumble, Bucharest-based UiPath, CrowdStrike, PagerDuty, Deliveroo and  Squarespace, among others.\n  It also had 40 companies experience an M&amp;A, including Utah-based Qualtrics\u2019s $8 billion acquisition by SAP and Segment\u2019s $3.2 billion acquisition by Twilio. Also, just last week, Rockwell Automation announced it was   buying Michigan-based Plex Systems  for  $2.22 billion in cash. Accel first invested in Plex, which has developed a subscription-based smart manufacturing platform, in 2012.\n Recent investments include a number of fintech companies such as LatAm\u2019s  Flink, Berlin-based  Trade Republic,  Unit and Robinhood rival  Public. Accel has also backed as existing portfolio companies such as  Webflow, a software company that helps businesses build no-code websites and events startup  Hopin.\n   \u201cFor example, we\u2019ll look at automation companies, consumer businesses and security companies, but at a global scale. Our goal is to find the best entrepreneurs regardless of where they are,\u201d she said.\n That has only been intensified by the recent rise of the smartphone and cloud, Wong said.\n \u201cBefore, companies were mostly selling to the consumer in their own country,\u201d he added. \u201cBut now the size of the market is so dramatically bigger, allowing them to become even larger, which is one of the reasons why I believe we\u2019re seeing investment pace at this speed.\u201d\n To support this, it\u2019s notable that Accel\u2019s global Leaders fund is \u201cdramatically\u201d larger than the $500 million Leaders fund the firm closed in 2019.\n Also, de Rycker points out, companies are staying private longer so the opportunity to invest in them until they sell or go public is greater.\n Accel is also patient. In some cases, the firm\u2019s investors will develop \u201cyears-long\u201d relationships with companies they are courting.\n \u201c1Password is an example of this approach,\u201d Wong said. \u201cArun [Mathew] had that relationship for at least six years before that investment was made.

Today, Alphabet\u2019s drone-delivery subsidiary Wing announced that it\u2019s launching its OpenSky app in the U.S. on Google Play and the iOS App Store.\n   The app was launched in Australia back in 2019 for both hobbyist and commercial drone pilots, with help from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). The U.S. version was created with input from the FAA for operation in Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) airspaces.\n Using the app, drone operators can request approval to operate in spaces like those around areas, expediting a process that would traditionally take days or weeks to go through.\n \u201cWhy is a drone delivery company investing in an operator app?\u201d Wing asks rhetorically in a blog post. \u201cBecause with nearly two million registered drones in the U.S. already, regulatory compliance of all drones will allow them to share the sky safely. Moreover, compliance will ultimately expand the uses and benefits of drones \u2014 among them emergency response, commercial inspections and contactless delivery \u2014 to more people.\u201d",

", "note_en": "At first blush, it may seem like a textbook example of a startup idea destined never to get anywhere. By definition, any new search engine competes with Google, whose 90 percent-plus market share leaves little oxygen for other players. And we\u2019ve been accustomed to getting our search for free since well  before there was a Google\u2014which might make paying for it sound like being expected to purchase a phone book.\n But  Neeva is indeed a new search engine, officially launching today, that carries a subscription fee. Though it\u2019s extremely similar to Google in many respects\u2014with a few twists of its own\u2014it dumps the web giant\u2019s venerable ad-based business model in the interest of avoiding distractions, privacy quandaries, and other compromises. It\u2019s free for three months\u2014long enough for users to grow accustomed to it without obligation\u2014and $4.95 a month thereafter. Apps for iPhones and iPads, and browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Brave, are part of the deal.\n Neeva may have a certain whiff of improbability about it, but its cofounders,  Sridhar Ramaswamy and Vivek Raghunathan, are the furthest thing from na\u00effs. Two long-time Google executives with more than a quarter-century of experience at the web giant between them, they have an insider\u2019s understanding of how it operates. Moreover, about 30 percent of the roughly 60-person staff they\u2019ve assembled at Neeva consists of ex-Googlers, including Hall-of-Famers such as Udi Manber (a former head of Google search) and Darin Fisher (one of the inventors of Chrome). They\u2019ve also secured $77.5 million in funding, including investments from venture-capital titans Greylock and Sequoia.\n  At its highest level, Neeva represents a bet that the way Google monetizes search and other services through advertising\u2014as it\u2019s done for more than two decades to wildly profitable effect\u2014has hampered its user experience, thereby opening up an opportunity. \u201cI tell people that Neeva is as much a social experiment as it is a technological experiment,\u201d says Ramaswamy, the company\u2019s CEO. \u201cIt\u2019s looking for the answer to the question, \u2018If there was a high-quality product that clearly benefits you in multiple ways, would you pay for it as opposed to having it be free, supported by ads?&#39;\u201d\n Whatever the answer to that question, Neeva\u2019s creators understand what they\u2019re getting into. \u201cSridhar and Vivek, with their depth of knowledge on everything from technology to what people actually need and do, are probably the only people in the world where I would go, \u2018Okay, I\u2019ll go on this journey with you, because you know how to go on this journey,&#39;\u201d says Greylock partner and LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman.\n (Which is not to say there aren\u2019t other ambitious privacy-centric search engines on journeys at least somewhat similar to Neeva\u2019s. DuckDuckGo has been on its own for 13 years;  once a one-man operation, it now has  129 employees and $100 million in annual revenue from ads that don\u2019t involve tracking individual users. And Brave, the browser company  founded by web pioneer Brendan Eich, is beta-testing its own  privacy-first search engine and says free and for-pay versions will be available.)\n  Looming antitrust case aside, it\u2019s not that Google is all that obviously vulnerable. Over the years, unlike some products with monopolistic market share\u2014 Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer comes to mind\u2014the search behemoth hasn\u2019t calcified through lack of competition. Instead, it remains the category\u2019s\u00a0 leading engine of innovation: Google says that it  rolled out 4,500 improvements\u00a0last year alone.\n But  some of the downsides of Google\u2019s dependence on ad revenues are right before our eyes. Once famously unobtrusive, the ads displayed with search results have gradually migrated from the right column to the top of search results, multiplied in number and size, and lost the shaded box that isolated them from organic results. Today, for many searches, ads all but crowd the organic results off the screen until you scroll downwards. For others, links to Google\u2019s own money-making services, such as Google Flights, get prime real estate.\n  Then there\u2019s the fact that Google  builds profiles of its users based on their online activity, the better to precisely target them with advertising not only at its own sites but all the other ones across the web whose ads are powered by Google. With no ads to serve up, Neeva shouldn\u2019t leave privacy-conscious types feeling like they\u2019re being monitored for ulterior purposes. (By default, Neeva does hold onto your searches for 90 days to improve the quality of features such as autosuggestions, but you can erase this log or tell the service you don\u2019t want it to keep it in the first place.)\n  In another break from search-engine tradition, Neeva says that it will  turn at least 20 percent of its top-line revenue over to publishing partners, including the first two it\u2019s announced, Quora and Medium. Though the details of where this could lead remain vague, it\u2019s another attempt to set Neeva apart from Google, which has often been accused of benefiting from media outlets\u2019 content without adequate compensation, a long-simmering dispute that has led to  lawsuits and  legislation. (After years of controversy, Google can at least point to the fact that it\u2019s  spending $1 billion on programs involving giving money to news outlets.)\n  Ramaswamy and Raghunathan tend to frame their discomfort about Google\u2019s business model in polite terms. One of Neeva\u2019s investors\u2014NYU professor, author, and entrepreneur  Scott Galloway\u2014isn\u2019t so circumspect. As you might expect of someone who has  called for the breakup of Google and other tech giants, he\u2019s withering in his analysis of Google and enthusiastic about the possibility of an upstart like Neeva chipping away at its pervasiveness.\n \u201cThe addictive nature of search, of getting answers at your fingertips or connecting with people, that\u2019s sort of the nicotine,\u201d says Galloway. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for you, it\u2019s addictive, but it doesn\u2019t give you cancer. The thing that gives you cancer, the tobacco, if you will, is the ad model. Because ultimately, over time, all you\u2019re focused on is gathering more data on the consumer so that you can further monetize him or her. And where it ends up is where you are now with Google, where Google no longer takes you to the best place based on your query, but to another place they can further monetize.\u201d\n  Galloway emphasizes that he put money into Neeva mostly because he thinks it\u2019s a smart investment. At the same time, he adds, \u201cI want to be a small part of the effort to try and release the stranglehold that Google has on content discovery. I think it leads to very bad places.\u201d\n Even if you\u2019re nowhere near as agitated over Google\u2019s dominance and practices as Galloway is, you might find yourself rooting for for what Neeva is trying to accomplish. Search \u201cis a phenomenal daily habit that has transformed how we live,\u201d says Neeva board member Margo Georgiadis, herself a former high-ranking Googler who ran the company\u2019s commercial and ad operations in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America. \u201cBut there\u2019s an opportunity with how we\u2019ve evolved the way we live our lives and use technology to make it much, much better if your business model is aligned 100 percent with the consumer.\u201d\n It\u2019s hard to bring up ad-subsidized services from big tech companies without someone helpfully reminding you that if  you\u2019re not paying for the product, you are the product. With Neeva\u2019s subscription-based model, the product is unquestionably the product. It just needs to be a compelling one\u2014even though its team is small and the competition has a 23-year head start.\n  In a way, the Neeva story begins in 2003. That\u2019s when Ramaswamy joined Google and was put to work on its still-nascent advertising team. Placing targeted text ads next to search results was already proving to be a powerful idea, but \u201clittle did I, or most others, realize that this would be one of the largest businesses ever,\u201d he remembers. He devoted the next fifteen years to the engineering side of that growth, eventually overseeing 10,000 Googlers as senior VP of ads and commerce.\n But by the latter part of that time, he was developing qualms about the whole proposition of monetizing eyeballs through targeted ads all around the web, as Google was doing. \u201cOne of the things that I paid a lot of attention to is how data was separated between off-Google experiences and on-Google experiences,\u201d he explains. \u201cTo me, keeping that data separate was an important part of the promise that Google implicitly made to its users.\u201d Increasingly, however, he found himself having to consent to compromises such as users\u2019 Google searches influencing the ads they saw on YouTube.\n \u201cWe tried to be thoughtful about how information flowed around, but it was also very clear where things were pointed at,\u201d Ramaswamy says. Having had his fill of the dilemmas associated with the ad business, he explored the possibility of pivoting to a different role within Google. Ultimately, \u201cI decided that a clean start was what I needed,\u2019 he says.\n  After quitting Google in the fall of 2018, he thought he\u2019d found that clean start as a venture capitalist at Greylock. The conflict between ad-based business models and serving users remained on his mind, though. Thinking about it took him down the path that would lead to Neeva.\n Soon, he was joined in this exploration by Raghunathan, who\u2019d had an impressive Google career of his own. In the middle of it, he\u2019d worked on  Google Now, an initiative to make search more anticipatory that later evolved into the Google Assistant. He says that he found shaping the future of search to be exhilarating, but nonetheless then \u201cwent over to the dark side, and I monetized YouTube.\u201d\n Like Ramaswamy, Raghunathan wrestled with the effect that business pressures had on user experiences. Marketers love to reinforce their messaging by exposing consumers to the same ad over and over and over. YouTube fans rankle at such repetition. Guess whose interests won out? \u201cWe\u2019d have these well-intentioned conversations around trading off users\u2019 happiness for customer value,\u201d Raghunathan recounts.\n  Still at Google, Raghunathan chatted with Ramaswamy about the startup idea the latter was formulating. \u201cI remember him telling me this insight, this string he was pulling on,\u201d says Raghunathan. \u201cThat you could not reimagine search the product without reimagining the business model that underpins search.\u201d Eager to join that effort, Raghunathan left Google after almost 12 years to become Neeva\u2019s cofounder.\n (Why the name \u201cNeeva?\u201d Raghunathan cheerfully admits that they chose it, then backfilled in a rationale: \u201cIn hindsight, there is a story we can tell about Neeva, in Sanskrit, meaning \u2018fundamentals\u2019 or \u2018the basics.\u2019 It actually means something that is very core to our mission. But I\u2019d be lying if I told you we knew that.\u201d)\n As Ramaswamy and Raghunathan recruited a team, they found that other Googlers past and present were eager to take a fresh look at search, including some whom they hadn\u2019t known at their old company. \u201cThe kind of ideas I heard from Sridhar and Vivek really excited me,\u201d says Bindu Pucha, who was once an IBM Research staffer, spent five years at Google, and now works on infrastructure technology for Neeva.\n  For Udi Manber, what Neeva was up to was compelling enough to lure him back into search, an area he\u2019d left behind in 2015 to focus on health-related technologies at the National Institutes of Health and elsewhere. Earlier this year, he joined Neeva part-time, spending two or three days a week on research efforts.\n A legendary computer scientist who held top jobs at Yahoo and Amazon as well as Google, Manber was another key Googler who had his frustrations with the dynamics of ad-subsidized search. \u201cI was one of the biggest advocates of privacy at Google, and I pushed for it a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cI won some fights. I lost many others.\u201d The fact that Neeva is tiny is liberating, he argues: \u201cInnovation is hard for every company, but I think small companies are better at it than large companies overall.\u201d\n  To say that Neeva is in a position to rethink search is not to suggest that it\u2019s trying to change everything. What it\u2019s launching is not the iPhone to Google\u2019s BlackBerry. Indeed, much of the user experience can fairly be described as \u201cGoogle-like.\u201d\n  That\u2019s not a bad thing. \u201cThe paradox and the challenge here is that it has to be different enough from what already exists to get attention and to be engaging, but not so radically different that it\u2019s disorienting to people,\u201d says Greg Sterling, a  long-time observer of the search business and VP of market insights at location marketing company Uberall. \u201cThere\u2019s a weird tight rope that I think they\u2019re trying to walk.\u201d\n They\u2019re not doing it alone.\u00a0Neeva has indexed several billion web pages on its own but also credits Apple, Bing, and Yelp at the bottom of search results; other information providers include\u00a0Intrinio, Weather.com, and Xignite.\u00a0Even Google is an ingredient, with Google Maps embedded in search results.\n \u201cWherever we can build, we will build,\u201d declares Raghunathan. \u201cWhere we can license or buy, we will. Users don\u2019t care. And so we will do what makes sense for users to build a maximally differentiated, maximally useful, maximally, delightful product.\u201d\n  Nothing about the end result is likely to discombobulate the Googling masses. There\u2019s a search field that looks just like Google\u2019s search field\u2014except that it sports a rotating set of taglines such as \u201cNo ads here\u201d and \u201cYou are not the product.\u201d There are autosuggestions as you type, plus links to related searches and \u201cPeople Also Asked\u201d queries. Rows of videos and news items are interspersed throughout the results, and the right column often includes a block of facts on whatever you searched for based on sources such as Wikipedia.\n  Dig into the same results on Neeva and Google, however, and you\u2019ll notice some differences. For instance, while both search engines respond to searches such as \u201cbest laptops\u201d with tidy carousels summarizing expert reviews, they\u2019re more prominent on Neeva, while Google puts a similar-looking carousel of paid links at the top. You can also expand Neeva\u2019s summaries into more detailed previews without leaving the search results, a boon for comparison shopping. (The service takes a similar approach with recipes.)\n The Google home page consists of a search field, \u201cGoogle Search\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Feeling Lucky\u201d buttons, and an expanse of white space\u2014remarkably unchanged from its original look back in 1998. Neeva, by contrast, fills its home page with personalizable widgets. They include ones for local weather, stock prices of your choice, and news. That last widget consists entirely of stories from name-brand media outlets\u2014from  The Daily Beast to Fox News\u2014and you can customize it by specifying which sources you want to see more often or less often.\n  Still another distinguishing characteristic is Neeva\u2019s integrations with third-party services. You can hook the service up with information sources such as your Gmail or Outlook email and calendar, Google Drive or Dropbox storage, and/or Slack or Jira account. Neeva will then index them and intersperse material from them in your search results as well as presenting it in a dedicated \u201cPersonal\u201d tab. Google has experimented with similar concepts in the past\u2014it once  mashed up Google search and Gmail\u2014but seems to have moved on from the concept.\n  For all that\u2019s nice about Neeva\u2014starting with its organic results sitting at the top of the page rather than below a payload of advertising\u2014it hasn\u2019t done the impossible by reaching Google-like sophistication right out of the gate. Those product-oriented results for searches such as \u201cbest laptops\u201d are well packaged, but the ones I checked out were thin on sources, with  PC Mag dominating the review links to such an extent that I wondered if it was through some partnership deal. (It isn\u2019t.)\n Neeva also doesn\u2019t do local information anywhere near as well as Google: It knows my Zip Code, but when I searched for a local pizza chain, it gave me a map for the branch 28 miles away, not the one within walking distance. It can answer questions such as \u201cWhat time is it in Rio?\u201d and \u201cHow tall is Joe Biden?\u201d with facts that appear on the results page itself, but it doesn\u2019t do so for as dizzying an array of queries as Google does.\u00a0When I used the pre-release site, I also encountered the occasional out-and-out glitch, like a thumbnail map of San Francisco that turned into Indianapolis when I clicked on it.\n  Ramaswamy acknowledges that in its current state, Neeva is something of a rough draft: \u201cWe have several large launches planned for next month, on the search quality side, after being publicly available,\u201d he says. It will be interesting to see where it gets by the fall, when the people now signing up conclude their three-month free trials and choose whether to become paying customers.\n Where it could go after that is hard to say, but it\u2019s not like search has no remaining problems to solve. \u00a0When I asked Manber about what he was working on, he wouldn\u2019t tell me: \u201cI learned a long time ago to talk about things only after I\u2019ve done them, not when I\u2019m just planning to do them.\u201d\n  As I began working on this article and got pre-release access to Neeva, I wanted to use it all the time. To ensure that I didn\u2019t reflexively Google for anything, I went into Safari\u2019s settings to change my default search engine to Neeva. It was only then that I realized I couldn\u2019t. Most major browsers make you pick from a few pre-selected search engines, not (yet) including Neeva; only Chrome allows you to choose one that\u2019s not on its canned list.\n That experience underlined that Neeva is entering a world that isn\u2019t exactly wired to give a new stand-alone search engine its best shot at success. To control its destiny, a search company really needs to write at least some of its own software; it\u2019s not a coincidence that everyone from Google to  DuckDuckGo has come out with a browser. And now so has Neeva, with its iPhone and iPadOS browsers as well as extensions that embed similar functionality in other browsers.\n \u201cThe browser and search are just so intertwined, right?\u201d says Neeva software engineer Darin Fisher. \u201cSearch is such an important part of the UI of the browser.\u201d Fisher knows whereof he speaks: He\u2019s a 21-year veteran of the browser wars whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes Netscape and Firefox as well as Chrome from  its inception until earlier this year.\n According to Fisher, the symbiotic nature of browsing and searching can create design conundrums that put a browser/search engine company at odds with its users. For example, if you type the name of a site into the browser\u2019s address bar, will it send you right there? Or will it err on the side of directing you to a page of search results it can monetize through ads?\n With no ads, Neeva can resist such temptations. \u201cWhen I think about Neeva and that simple business model that it has\u2014if people are happy, they\u2019re paying\u2014it opens the door to not having that tension,\u201d says Fisher.\n Along with putting the Neeva search engine front and center, the company\u2019s apps and extensions allow it to implement privacy-related features it couldn\u2019t implement purely as web services. While browsing a website, you can click on an icon near its address to get a summary of the trackers it contains that monitor your browsing for advertising and other purposes; you can also turn on a feature called Tracking Prevention, which blocks such surveillance and speeds up page rendering.\n  A few days before Neeva\u2019s official debut, as I used the pre-release browser, I found that it not only foiled trackers but also eliminated advertisements all over the web. It turned out that Neeva was also surprised by the sweeping ad deletion, an artifact of its browser\u2019s reliance on core technologies from Mozilla\u2019s Firefox.

That could keep programmers who already use the company&#39;s tools satisfied and also attract new ones.\n  The system, called GitHub Copilot, draws on source code uploaded to code-sharing service GitHub, which Microsoft acquired in 2018, as well as other websites. Microsoft and GitHub developed it with help from OpenAI, an AI research start-up that Microsoft  backed in 2019.\n Researchers at Microsoft and other institutions have been trying to teach computers to write code for decades. The concept has yet to go mainstream, at times because programs to write programs have not been versatile enough. The GitHub Copilot effort is a notable attempt in the field, relying as it does on a large volume of code in many programming languages and vast Azure cloud computing power.\n Nat Friedman, CEO of GitHub, describes GitHub Copilot as a virtual version of what software creators call  a pair programmer -- that&#39;s when two developers work side by side collaboratively on the same project. The tool looks at existing code and comments in the current file and the location of the cursor, and it offers up one or more lines to add. As programmers accept or reject suggestions, the model learns and becomes more sophisticated over time.\n The new software makes coding faster, Friedman said in an interview last week. Hundreds of developers at GitHub have been using the Copilot feature all day while coding, and the majority of them are accepting suggestions and not turning the feature off, Friedman said.\n Programming involves coming up with an idea about how to do something and then implementing it, and GitHub Copilot is good at the second part, said Greg Brockman, a co-founder of OpenAI and its chief technology officer.\n  &#34;You don&#39;t want to go read  Twilio&#39;s API documentation. It knows all that stuff. It&#39;s actually quite reliable at it,&#34; he said. Brockman calls this work last-mile programming, and he said that having computers take care of it leads to speed improvements.\n  &#34;It can save me from having to dive through a whole bunch of documentation to get a tool to do a thing that I know it&#39;s capable of doing, and that is so good for productivity,&#34; he said. &#34;I can&#39;t even tell you the number of hours I&#39;ve wasted trying to figure out the right way to do a relatively prosaic thing, just navigating the complexity of these tools.&#34;\n  &#34;It may very well be one of those things that makes programming itself more approachable,&#34; Scott said.\n It supports almost every programming language, but it&#39;s been designed to work best with JavaScript, Python and TypeScript, Friedman said.\n GitHub Copilot will first appear in Microsoft&#39;s Visual Studio Code, a free open-source product, and Microsoft plans to incorporate it into the commercial Visual Studio product in the future.\n  The model at the core of GitHub Copilot, called Codex, is a descendent of GPT-3, a powerful model that OpenAI trained on large volumes of text, Brockman said. Engineers fed the model &#34;many, many terabytes of public source code out there,&#34; Friedman said.\n This isn&#39;t the first time Microsoft has leaned on OpenAI to deliver smart software. Last month  Microsoft showed how it would update the Power Apps Studio application, which nontechnical people use to write apps, so that users could type in words describing the elements they&#39;d like to add and have GPT-3 show options for the necessary code.\n OpenAI recognizes the potential for AI models to come up with code with GPT-3, which it introduced last year. The start-up says on  its website that an online service delivering GPT-3 can handle &#34;code completion.&#34; But back when OpenAI was first training the model, the start-up had no intention of teaching it how to help code, Brockman said. It was meant more as  a general purpose language model that could, for instance, generate articles, fix incorrect grammar and translate from one language into another.\n Over the next few months, people experimented with the model to see what it could do, both useful and silly --  for instance, one engineer made a website that could design a button that looked like a watermelon. Brockman reached out to Friedman, as he was running a key destination where millions of programmers work on code and things proceeded from there.\n GitHub employees have tried to ensure that GitHub Copilot will generate secure, high-quality code. &#34;We&#39;ve built a number of safety mechanisms into Copilot that we think are cutting-edge in terms of reducing the chances of mistakes in various areas here, but they&#39;re definitely not perfect,&#34; Friedman said.\n The underlying technology won&#39;t be only Microsoft&#39;s to use. OpenAI will release the Codex model this summer for third-party developers to weave into their own applications, Brockman said.\n Microsoft could someday release a version of the product that enterprises could train to understand their programming styles, Scott said. For now, Microsoft is only offering the service that knows about code stored in public repositories.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:16:56", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot",

regulatory and governmental approvals, in a press release post-publication. It also confirmed that the price of the acquisition which will be an $800 million all-cash deal.\n The deal gives 2U,  a company that filed to go public in 2014 and continues to be one of the rare U.S. edtech companies listed on the stock market, a new wave of collaboratively-built content to its software. Plus, 2U just acquired with stronger name recognition thanks to its Ivy League backers, which some see as a branding move that could help the public company with its own chunk of the market. The company\u2019s last big acquisition was in 2019,  when it paid $750 million to acquire Trilogy education, a company that builds in-person and online bootcamps in collaboration with universities.\n  EdX was founded in 2012 amid a crop of massive open online course (MOOC) offerings, including Udacity and Coursera. The company, set up as a non-profit, had an alluring promise upon launch: it would help anyone in the world take a Harvard or MIT class, for free. The institutions, of course, have thrown in a cumulative $80 million in donations into edX to keep the operation free.  Its own launch came weeks after Coursera announced that Princeton, Stanford, UPenn, and the University of Michigan would host courses on its own online learning platform. Now, edX\u2019s acquisition comes months after Coursera went public.\n  Today, edX, led by president and professor Anant Agarwal, hosts over 3,000 courses led by 15,000 instructors and used by 35 million users. Open edX, the platform\u2019s open source platform, is used by 2,400 learning sites worldwide,  according to the organization\u2019s website.\n EdX will turn into a public benefit corporation as part of this transaction. Per sources, proceeds from the transaction will go into another non-profit managed by Harvard and MIT, and the institutions will not profit off of the transaction. That said, an MIT statement reveals. that edX took a line of credit from MIT and Harvard, and those funds will be returned to both institutions.\n \u201cBecause edX is a public charity, the proceeds from its sale can only be distributed for a purpose consistent with edX\u2019s mission, not to compensate those who contributed to the nonprofit,\u201d  the statement reads.\n Part of this transaction, which has been in the works since February 2021, is colored by the fact that edX has been transparent with its own financial woes and journey to becoming a self-sustaining business. Then MIT Provost Rafael Reif, now the president of the school, had  hinted at eventual revenue generation the program first launched, saying in 2012 that \u201cthe drive is not to make money..that said, we intend to find a way to support those activities. There are several approaches we are considering, and we don\u2019t want this project to become a drain on the budgets of MIT or Harvard.\u201d\n In 2018, the same fiscal year it  had $37 million in revenue, edX introduced  a support fee, alongside its ongoing offering that asks students to pay for a verified certification upon course completion. In announcement, the company wrote that \u201cwe believe that we need to move toward a financial model that allows edX and our partners to achieve sustainability and we acknowledge that means moving away from our current model of offering virtually everything for free.\u201d The edX board also considered other options, MIT. said,  but decided those were \u201cnot as beneficial to edX, its learners, or its partner institutions as the transaction with 2U.\u201d\n The new transaction and edX\u2019s choice to turn into a public benefit corporation might become the financial model that it itself was looking for, indicating just how. hard it may be to monetize a MOOC. While 2U has committed to continuing edX\u2019s free coursework for at least five years, as well as seeding a new non-profit, edX as it currently stands \u2013 a massive education non-profit \u2013 will no longer function as it currently does in the future.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:16:36", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

\uff08song@heraldcorp.com\uff09 ", "note_en": "A Seoul court\u2019s decision last week that effectively confirmed Netflix\u2018s obligation to pay network usage fees to mobile carriers suggests that the global video streaming giant might have to change its business strategy in South Korea, according to industry sources Monday.   The US-based content provider that raised 415.5 billion won ($367.6 million) in revenue in Korea alone last year has not been paying network fees to provider SK Broadband, the internet protocol TV subsidiary of SK Telecom.   The SK unit filed a complaint with the Korea Communications Commission in November 2019, and Netflix sued SK a few months later. Netflix asked the court to review whether or not it has an obligation to pay for its network usage.   On Friday, the court ruled against Netflix, saying, \u201cAccording to the principle of freedom of contract, whether to conclude a contract and what price to pay is a matter to be decided through the negotiations of the concerned parties.\u201d\u00a0  The court also said, \u201cNetflix is at least receiving network services, including management of the network quality, at a cost.\u201d\u00a0  \u201cIt is also reasonable to say that Netflix has the obligation of paying the price for the services to SK Broadband.\u201d  Friday\u2018s ruling was interpreted by industry watchers as indicating the principle of net neutrality is losing ground in Korea, where global platform giants, including Facebook and Google, would be obligated to pay the price for their massive network traffic as they see growing numbers of Korean subscribers.   \u201cThis decision clearly confirms by law that Netflix needs to pay network usage fees to SK Broadband,\u201d the internet service provider said.   It seems highly likely that Netflix will appeal, although the US firm officially said it will continue its partnership with SK Broadband for both companies\u2019 customers and promised to continue investing in its \u201copen connect\u201d strategy.   The US firm has forged marketing partnerships with KT and LG U+, giving it an upper hand on the fee issue with the two other mobile carriers.\u00a0  \u00a0On Monday, SKT CEO Park Jung-ho commented on the issue, saying, \u201cThe time has come to meet Netflix.\u201d  \u201cI think the ruling can make our meeting much better. Cooperation in Asia will be important for Netflix.\u201d   According to industry estimates, the total fees Netflix will have to pay to all three mobile carriers would be over 100 billion won a year.   Netflix accounted for 4.8 percent of the country\u2019s total network traffic in the fourth quarter of 2020.   Korean portal giant Naver, which accounted for 1.8 percent of all traffic, paid around 70 billion won last year. Kakao paid around 30 billion won   The court estimated the network usage fee for SK would be around 200 billion won.   \u201cIf Netflix changes its stance and is willing to talk with us, both firms could appraise the exact amount of fees,\u201d an official from SK Broadband said. \u201cHowever, an appeal is highly likely to follow.\u201d   Last year, as the COVID-19 pandemic affected Korea, the number of Netflix users grew and network traffic spiked due to the streaming service, the SK official explained.   Since the Korean telecommunications network is part of the national backbone, when network speeds slow down, mobile carriers are forced to deal with poor network quality.   Also, unlike in the United States where the net neutrality principle was abandoned, Korea keeps the principle that stipulates internet service providers should treat all data on the internet the same, and not discriminate against content providers.   Netflix, which pays usage fees in the US, Japan and France, insists on net neutrality in Korea.   \u201cThe latest ruling might give KT and LG U+ room for negotiating the fee,\u201d said an industry official. \u201cIt would also affect entries and business strategies of other foreign content providers like Disney+ and Amazon Prime that are eyeing the Korean market.\u201d\u00a0  ( song@heraldcorp.com)", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:16:24", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "2020,\u7f51\u7edc,traffic,netflix", "title": "\u97e9\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u88c1\u5b9aNetflix\u6709\u4e49\u52a1\u5411\u79fb\u52a8\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u652f\u4ed8\u7f51\u7edc\u4f7f\u7528\u8d39; Netflix\u57282020\u5e74\u7b2c\u56db\u5b63\u5ea6\u5360\u8be5\u56fd\u4ea4\u901a\u76844.8\uff05 ", "title_en": "A South Korean court has ruled that Netflix is obligated to pay network usage fees to mobile carriers; Netflix made up 4.8% of the country's traffic in Q4 2020", "transed": 1, "url": "http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20210628000798", "via": "", "real_tags": ["2020", "\u7f51\u7edc", "traffic", "netflix"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "cd79ea6516cd435bdfe215883d9a5383.jpg", "infoid": 1068552, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Snapchat\u662f\u8b66\u544aiPhone\u7528\u6237\uff0cApp Store\u4e2d\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u7248\u672c\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u516c\u53f8\u6b63\u5728\u5c1d\u8bd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\n  Snapchat\u4e0a\u6b21\u57286\u670828\u65e5\u5728App Store\u4e2d\u66f4\u65b0\u4e86IOS\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u7248\u672c11.34.0.35\u66f4\u65b0\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\uff06\uff0334;\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\uff06\uff0334;\u5230\u6d88\u606f\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4\u53d1\u5e03\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e9b\u7528\u6237\u51fa\u9519\u4e86\u3002\n \u8bb8\u591aSnapchat\u7528\u6237\u58f0\u79f0\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u6253\u5f00\u5b83\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5c06\u81ea\u52a8\u5d29\u6e83\u5230iPhone\u4e3b\u5c4f\u5e55\u3002\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u89e6\u53d1\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u76f8\u673a\u8fdb\u6599\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u89c1\u4e4b\u540e\u3002\n  Snapchat\uff06\uff0339; S\u652f\u6301\u56e2\u961f\u5728\u661f\u671f\u4e00\u53d1\u5e03\u5230Twitter\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\uff06\uff0334;\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u8b66\u544a\u7528\u6237\uff06\uff0334;\u6302\u7d27\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5b83\u5e76\u5728\u4fee\u590d\u4e0a\u5de5\u4f5c\uff01\uff06\uff0334;\n \u867d\u7136\u5b83\u662f\u672a\u77e5\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5728App Store\u4e2d\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u5fc5\u987b\u901a\u8fc7App Store Review\u8fdb\u7a0b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba1\u67e5\u672c\u8eab\u5feb\u901f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u5982\u679c\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\uff0c\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7248\u672c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f88\u5feb\u5230\u8fbe\u3002\n \u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4e0b\u53487:23\u3002\u4e1c\u90e8\uff1aSnapchat\u62a5\u544a\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5df2\u5f97\u5230\u4fee\u590d\u3002\u7ee7\u7eed\u770b\u5230\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7528\u6237\u88ab\u6307\u793a\u624b\u52a8\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u66f4\u65b0\u5230\u7248\u672c11.34.1.35\u3002\n \u5728\u6bcf\u5468AppleInsider\u64ad\u5ba2\u4e2d\u8ddf\u4e0aApple  - \u5e76\u6bcf\u5929\u4eceAppleInsider\u83b7\u5f97\u5feb\u901f\u65b0\u95fb\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u521a\u8bf4\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u563f\uff0c\u897f\u91cc\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u5230\u60a8\u7684HomePod Mini\u5e76\u8be2\u95ee\u8fd9\u4e9b\u64ad\u5ba2\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6211\u4eec\u6700\u65b0\u7684HomeKit Insider Enisode\u3002 \n\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u60f3\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u4e3b\u8981AppleInsider\u64ad\u5ba2\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u82f9\u679c\uff06\uff0339; s vodcasts\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8ba2\u96055\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u901a\u8fc7Patreon\u6765\u652f\u6301AppleInsider Podcast\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u559c\u6b22\u4efb\u4f55\u5176\u4ed6\u64ad\u5ba2\u64ad\u653e\u5668\u3002  AppleInsider\u5df2\u7ecf\u63d0\u4ea4\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u76df\u94fe\u63a5\u8d2d\u4e70\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u57f9\u8bad\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u3002 \u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u5185\u5bb9\u3002 ", "note_en": "Snapchat is warning iPhone users that the version of the messaging app available in the  App Store has a problem, and is something the company is trying to solve.\n  Snapchat last updated its  iOS app in the App Store on  June 28, with the version 11.34.0.35 update adding a number of &#34;bug fixes&#34; to the messaging tool. However, the maintenance release has gone wrong for some users.\n A number of Snapchat users claim the app automatically crashes to the iPhone Home Screen whenever it is opened. It is unclear what is triggering the crash, but it occurs just after the camera feed becomes visible.\n  Snapchat&#39;s support teams  posted to Twitter on Monday that it is &#34;aware of the issue,&#34; warning users to &#34;Hang tight, we are looking into it and working on a fix!&#34;\n While it is unknown exactly when the patch will be available in the App Store, given it has to pass through the App Store review process to do so, it is likely that the major app may be fast-tracked through the review itself. If so, the updated version could arrive fairly soon.\n Update, 7:23 p.m. Eastern: Snapchat reports the issue has  been fixed. Users who continue to see problems are instructed to manually update their app to version 11.34.1.35.\n Keep up with everything Apple in the weekly AppleInsider Podcast \u2014 and get a fast news update from AppleInsider Daily.
