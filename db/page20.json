The IRS will let taxpayers verify their identity via a live, virtual interview to create an account,  the agency said Monday.\n    The new option in the agency&#39;s authentication system is now available as a short-term solution for this year&#39;s tax filing system, the IRS said.\n The agency received  significant criticism for previously requiring taxpayers to authenticate their identity by providing a selfie. The IRS used facial recognition software from ID.me to analyze the selfies after signing an  $86 million contract with the company.\n Civil rights groups and  members of Congress from both parties questioned how the IRS could begin the use of facial recognition without advance warning. Consequently, earlier this month, the IRS said it would  stop using the ID.me facial recognition software, adding in a statement that it will &#34;transition away from using a third-party service for facial recognition to help authenticate people creating new online accounts.&#34;\n However, the announcement did little to quell outrage about the initial decision to use ID.me&#39;s tools, and senators on both sides of the aisle  continued to raise concerns about what information ID.me gained access to.\n The IRS said Monday that taxpayers will still have the option to verify their identity automatically with ID.me&#39;s biometric verification tools. For taxpayers who select this option, new requirements are in place to ensure images provided by taxpayers are deleted for the account being created. Furthermore, the IRS said, any existing biometric data from taxpayers who previously created an IRS Online Account that has already been collected will also be permanently deleted over the course of the next few weeks.\n For future tax filing seasons, the IRS is aiming to roll out Login.Gov as an authentication tool.", "posttime": "2022-02-22 13:56:43", "source_domain": "slashdot.org",

"Partner Alex Brunicki said in a statement: \u201cWe\u2019ve pushed ourselves to be an entrepreneurial fund\u2026 I\u2019d say we\u2019ve made it to our \u2018Series A\u2019. We\u2019re developing deeper edge in frontier markets like Biotech and Crypto; we\u2019re bringing nascent communities together \u2013 such as Coin-Op \u2013 in a meaningful way; and we\u2019ve built an exceptional team to support our founders at scale.\u201d\n Co-founded and launched in 2016 by Partners Andre de Haes and Brunicki, Backed says it now has 67 companies with an aggregate value of \u20ac10.7Bn. It\u2019s also claiming three unicorns: SkyMavis owners of crypto game Axie Infinity; banking platform Thought Machine; and the Ethereum Layer 2 solution Immutable X. It\u2019s also had exists such as mobile gaming studio, Hutch Games, which sold to MTG for $375M in November 2020.\n  LPs in the fund include firms such as Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (through their Sienna Capital vehicle) and private firms such as Wilshire Associates, alongside 20 family offices and over 20 entrepreneurs.\n The question is, with so many early-stage VC funds now playing across Europe, what sets Backed apart from the others?\n Backed says it\u2019s all about being \u201chuman-centric\u201d. That translates into an 18-month founder support programme, with leadership training, workshops, in-house recruiter, mental health service providers and an in-house executive coach for founders and leadership teams.\n In other words: a large swathe of training and events. Backed\u2019s other \u2018special sauce\u2019 \u2013 it says \u2013 is plenty of off-sites and founder retreats. Whether you want to describe those as \u2018parties\u2019 or not is up to you, but it\u2019s just as well that, in modern times, UK Prime Minister Boris Johson has re-defined the meaning of the phrase \u2018work events\u2019.\n  This emphasis on hosting translates into 30 events annually, from founder dinners to a 1,000 person party at the Finnish tech conference Slush, and co-hosting conferences such as Coin-Op, a global blockchain-gaming summit held at the London Science Museum.\n Backed also has 60 Venture Scouts in its network across Europe such as Maximillian Bade, GP at Nucleus Capital, Abi Mohamed, Programme Lead at Tech Nation, Saloni Bhojwani, Partner at Pink Salt Ventures, and Nalden, Founder of WeTransfer and Adelee.\n In an interview de Haes told me: \u201cDuring the pandemic, we launched three different kinds of workshop or webinar series for founders, such as how do you survive a pandemic and how do you look after your people. Now that we\u2019re moving back to an offline world\u2026 it\u2019s ramping up again. So this year, for example, we\u2019ve got two three-day retreats in Italy and Ibiza for founders, six crypto gaming events. So it\u2019s we\u2019re going back to a much more in-person experience.\u201d\n The question, however, is how are all these events funded, given VCs aren\u2019t usually in the events business?: \u201cWe\u2019re funding from management fee and from voluntary contributions that attendees make up the events,\u201d de Haes told me. \u201cAnd then from sponsors, so AWS, Pernod Ricard \u2013 these sorts of businesses want to be associated with this clan of people.\u201d\n   \u2022 21% Web3 / Blockchain\u2022 15% Gaming &amp; Entertainment\u2022 12% Biotech\u2022 10% Financial Services\u2022 10%

"note_en": "MarketForce, which was launched in Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda last year after  growing beyond Kenya and Nigeria, plans to introduce buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) options to help merchants access fast-moving-consumer-goods (FMCGs) on credit. It also plans to enter additional markets in East and West Africa.\n Through its merchant super app  RejaReja, informal traders can source goods (hundreds of SKUs) directly from manufacturers and distributors, make and pay for orders digitally, accept payments for utility bills and access loans for their businesses. The RejaReja retail marketplace was launched in 2020 as a brainchild of MarketForce, a SaaS product for the formal markets, founded by  Tesh Mbaabu and  Mesongo Sibuti in 2018.\n  \u201cOur mission is to enable SMEs to grow, and what we\u2019ve realized over time is that offering them loans is great, but that we need to empower them to access goods. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve introduced this merchant inventory financing, which is like an overdraft facility, where they\u2019re able to order goods and pay later after selling them. We started a pilot and it is going well,\u201d MarketForce CEO and co-founder Mbaabu told TechCrunch.\n During the pilot, Mbaabu said that order stock value tripled, underlining the demand for such tailored inventory financing options for traders who sell a huge chunk of all the FMCGs sold across sub-Saharan Africa.\n \u201cWe\u2019re very deliberate about extending working capital and that\u2019s why we raised some debt and also because we are looking at that fintech angle as our big frontier for the next phase of our business,\u201d said Mbaabu.\n This latest round (equal amount of debt and equity) brings the total funds raised by MarketForce to date to $42.5 million. It also comes seven months after the startup  raised $2 million in a pre-Series A round.\n  The latest round was led by V8 Capital Partners; a London and Lagos based African-focused investment vehicle with participation from Ten13 VC, SOSV Select Fund, Vu Ventures, Vastly Valuable Ventures, Uncovered Fund. Existing investors that took part in the round include Reflect Ventures, Greenhouse Capital, Century Oak Capital and Remapped Ventures. Cellulant co-founder Ken Njoroge, who joins the MarketForce board as chairman, also took part in the round.\n \u201cMarketForce demonstrates what we see as a triple threat with regards to returns. A strong executive team with an amazing track record, an expansive untapped market of informal retailers across the continent, and a business model that scales extremely quickly,\u201d said V8 Capital General Partner and member of the MarketForce board, Tobi Oke.\n  MarketForce also plans to double its team to 800 and grow the number of merchants using the RejaReja app by 2.5 times to 250,000 over the next few months, growing from 5,000 they served a year ago. A growth in merchant number and RejaReja\u2019s expansion also means new markets for FMCG brands.\n RejaReja is an asset-light model meaning that it doesn\u2019t own capital assets like warehouses and delivery trucks as most of them are provided by its partners that include manufacturers and distributors. Its nature of business allows it to grow fast.\n \u201cWe grew to tier two cities in markets that we are in. This has also opened up distribution opportunities for brands that were not previously able to access these markets,\u201d said Mbaabu.\n During an interview in December last year, Mbaabu told TechCrunch that RejaReja expects its merchants to grow to 1 million by the end of this year as it works towards digitizing the estimated 100 million small traders across sub-Saharan Africa.\n He also said that since launch, RejaReja had grown exponentially with over 87,000 orders made through the platform at an average basket value of $151. With a 40% month-on-month growth, it expected to record over $60 million in annualized transaction volumes at the end of last year. RejaReja\u2019s main competitors include  TradeDepot\u00a0and\u00a0 Sokowatch.\n About  80% of household retail in sub-Saharan Africa is delivered through informal retailers but these shops are faced with a number of challenges like stockouts, earnings instability and lack of financing, factors that make it hard for their businesses to grow.\n MarketForce, through RejaReja, solves this by providing a marketplace where informal traders can source goods directly, which also keeps the prices of products competitive by removing the need for agents, and ensures the next-day delivery of goods. It also uses the traders\u2019 transaction history to develop the credit profiles needed to secure loans. The startup has a partnership with Pezesha \u2014 a digital financial marketplace platform \u2014 to extend loans to its merchants.\n MarketForce plans more partnerships to bring on board other services for merchants like insurance, savings and investment.\n \u201cThe goal of RejaReja is to be the super app of the informal market. We\u2019d like the merchants to have one access point for all the different financial and digital services they need to grow in the digital age,\u201d said Mbaabu.", "posttime": "2022-02-22 13:48:34",

"note_en": "The US Copyright Office has rejected a request to let an AI copyright a work of art. Last week,  a three-person board reviewed a 2019 ruling against Steven Thaler, who tried to copyright a picture on behalf of an algorithm he dubbed Creativity Machine. The board found that Thaler\u2019s AI-created image didn\u2019t include an element of \u201chuman authorship\u201d \u2014 a necessary standard, it said, for protection.\n Creativity Machine\u2019s work, seen above, is named \u201cA Recent Entrance to Paradise.\u201d It\u2019s part of a series  Thaler has described as a \u201csimulated near-death experience\u201d in which an algorithm reprocesses pictures to create hallucinatory images and a fictional narrative about the afterlife. Crucially, the AI is supposed to do this with extremely minimal human intervention, which has proven a dealbreaker for the Copyright Office.\n \u201cCourts have been consistent in finding that non-human expression is ineligible for copyright protection\u201d\n The board\u2019s decision calls \u201cthe nexus between the human mind and creative expression\u201d a vital element of copyright. As it notes, copyright law doesn\u2019t directly outline rules for non-humans, but courts have taken a dim view of claims that animals or divine beings can take advantage of copyright protections. A 1997 decision says that a book of (supposed)  divine revelations, for instance, could be protected if there was (again, supposedly) an element of human arrangement and curation. More recently, a court found that a monkey  couldn\u2019t sue for copyright infringement. \u201cThe courts have been consistent in finding that non-human expression is ineligible for copyright protection,\u201d the board says.\n This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean  any art with an AI component is ineligible. Thaler emphasized that humans weren\u2019t meaningfully involved because his goal was to prove that machine-created works could receive protection, not simply to stop people from infringing on the picture. (He\u2019s  unsuccessfully tried to establish that AIs can patent inventions in the US as well.) The board\u2019s reasoning takes his explanation for granted. So if someone tried to copyright a similar work by arguing it was a product of their own creativity executed by a machine, the outcome might look different. A court could also reach an alternate conclusion on Thaler\u2019s work if he follows his rejection with a lawsuit.\n Even so, the Copyright Office is highlighting the importance of human agency in machine-produced works. As AI becomes  a bigger part of artists\u2019 repertoires, the limits of that conclusion could be tested for years to come.", "posttime": "2022-02-22 13:40:23", "source_domain": "slashdot.org",

"note_en": "I&#39;m trying some experimental tiers on Patreon to see if I can get to  substack-like levels of financial support for this blog without moving to substack!    Misidentifying talent     Here are some notes from talent scouts:  Recruit A:  ... will be a real specimen with chance to have a Dave Parker body. Facially looks like Leon Wagner. Good body flexibility. Very large hands.\n  Recruit B:  Outstanding physical specimen \u2013 big athletic frame with broad shoulders and long, solid arms and leg. Good bounce in his step and above avg body control. Good strong face.\n  Out of context, you might think they were scouting actors or models, but these are baseball players (&#34;A&#34; is Lloyd Moseby, &#34;B&#34; is Jim Abbott, and &#34;C&#34; is Derek Jeter), ones that were quite good (Lloyd Moseby was arguably only a very good player for perhaps four years, but that makes him extraordinary compared to most players who are scouted). If you read other baseball scouting reports, you&#39;ll see a lot of comments about how someone has a &#34;good face&#34;, who they look like, what their butt looks like, etc.\n  Basically everyone wants to hire talented folks. But even in baseball, where returns to hiring talent are obvious and high and which is the most easily quantified major U.S. sport, people made fairly obvious blunders for a century due to relying on incorrectly honed gut feelings that relied heavily on unconscious as well as conscious biases. Later, we&#39;ll look at what baseball hiring means for other fields, but first, let&#39;s look at how players who didn&#39;t really pan out ended up with similar scouting reports (programmers who don&#39;t care about sports can think of this as equivalent to interview feedback) as future superstars, such as the following comments on  Adam Eaton, who was a poor player by pro standards despite being considered one of the hottest prospects (potential hires) of his generation:\n  Scout 1: Medium frame/compact/firm. A very good athlete / shows quick &#34;cat-like&#34; reactions. Excellent overall body strength. Medium hands / medium length arms / w strong forearms ... Player is a tough competitor. This guy has some old fashioned bull-dog in his make-up.\n  Scout 2: Good body with frame to develop. Long arms and big hands. Narrow face. Has sideburns and wears hat military style. Slope shoulders. Strong inlegs ... Also played basketball. Good athlete .... Attitude is excellent. Can&#39;t see him breaking down. One of the top HS pitchers in the country\n  Scout 3: 6&#39;1&#34;-6&#39;2&#34; 180 solid upper and lower half. Room to pack another 15 without hurting\n  On the flip side, scouts would also pan players who would later turn out to be great based on their physical appearance, such as these scouts who were concerned about Albert Pujols&#39;s weight:\n  Scout 1: Heavy, bulky body. Extra (weight) on lower half. Future (weight) problem. Aggressive hitter with mistake HR power. Tends to be a hacker.\n  Scout 2: Good bat (speed) with very strong hands. Competes well and battles at the plate. Contact seems fair. Swing gets a little long at times. Will over pull. He did not hit the ball hard to CF or RF. Weight will become an issue in time.\n  Pujols ended up becoming one of the best baseball players of all time ( currently ranked 32nd by WAR). His weight wasn&#39;t a problem, but if you read scouting reports on other great players who were heavy or short, they were frequently underrated. Of course, baseball scouting reports didn&#39;t only look at people&#39;s appearances, but scouts were generally highly biased by what they thought an athlete should look like.\n  Because using stats in baseball has &#34;won&#34; (top teams all employ stables of statisticians nowadays) and &#34;old school&#34; folks don&#39;t want to admit this, we often see people saying that using stats doesn&#39;t really result in different outcomes than we used to get. But this is so untrue that the examples people give are generally  self-refuting. For example, here&#39;s what Sports Illustrated had to say on the matter:\n  Media and Internet draft prognosticators love to play up the \u201cscrappy little battler\u201d aspect with Madrigal, claiming that modern sabermetrics helps scouts include smaller players that were earlier overlooked. Of course, that is hogwash. A players [sic] abilities dictate his appeal to scouts\u2014not height or bulk\u2014and smaller, shorter players have always been a staple of baseball-from Mel Ott to Joe Morgan to Kirby Puckett to Jose Altuve.\n  These are curious examples to use in support of scouting since Kirby Puckett was famously overlooked by scouts despite putting up statistically dominant performances and was only able to become a baseball player through random happenstance, when the assistant director of the Twins  farm system went to watch his own son play in a baseball game his and saw Kirby Puckett in the same game, which led to the Twins drafting Kirby Puckett, who carried the franchise for a decade.\n  Joe Morgan was also famously overlooked and only managed to become a professional baseball player through random happenstance. Morgan put up statistically dominant numbers in high school, but was ignored due to his height. Because he wasn&#39;t drafted by a pro team, he went to Oakland City College, where he once again put up great numbers that were ignored. The reason a team noticed him was a combination of two coincidences. First, a new baseball team was created and that new team needed to fill a team and the associated farm system, which meant that they needed a lot of players. Second, that new baseball team needed to hire scouts and hired Bill Wight (who wasn&#39;t previously working as a scout) as a scout. Wight became known for not having the same appearance bias as nearly every other scout and was made fun of for signing &#34;funny looking&#34; baseball players. Bill convinced the new baseball team to &#34;hire&#34; quite a few overlooked players, including Joe Morgan.\n  Mel Ott was also famously overlooked and only managed to become a professional baseball player through happenstance. He was so dominant in high school that he played for adult semi-pro teams in his spare time. However, when he graduated, pro baseball teams didn&#39;t want him because he was too small, so he took a job at a lumber company and played for the company team. The owner of the company team was impressed by his baseball skills and, luckily for Ott, the owner of the company team was business partners and friends with the owner of a baseball team and effectively got Ott a position on a pro baseball team, resulting in the  20th best baseball career of all time as ranked by WAR  1. Most short baseball players probably didn&#39;t get a random lucky break; for every one who did, there are likely many who didn&#39;t.\n  Deciding who to &#34;hire&#34; for a baseball team was a high stakes decision with many millions of dollars (in 2022 dollars) on the line, but rather than attempt to seriously quantify productivity, teams decided who to draft (hire) based on all sorts of irrelevant factors. Like any major sport, baseball productivity is much easier to quantify than in most real-world endeavors since the game is much simpler than &#34;real&#34; problems are. And, among major U.S. sports, baseball is the easiest sport to quantify, but  this didn&#39;t stop baseball teams from spending a century overindexing on visually obvious criteria such as height and race.\n  I was reminded of this the other day when I saw a thread I recently saw on Twitter (which I don&#39;t want to link to because I don&#39;t want to make this about the person or the thread in particular \u2014 the opinion is one I frequently see from people who are successful). In the thread, a very successful person talks about how they got started, saying that they were able to talk their way into an elite institution despite being unqualified and use this story to conclude that elite gatekeepers are basically just scouting for talent and that you just need to show people that you have talent.\n  I&#39;ve heard this kind of story from other successful people, who tend to come to bimodal conclusions on what it all means. Some conclude that the world correctly recognized their talent and that this is how the world works; talent gets recognized and rewarded. Others conclude that the world is fairly random with respect to talent being rewarded and that they got lucky to get rewarded for their talent when many other people with similar talents who used similar strategies were passed over  2.\n  Another time I was reminded of old baseball scouting reports was when I heard about how a friend of mine who&#39;s now an engineering professor at a top Canadian university got there. Let&#39;s call her Jane. When Jane was an undergrad at the university she&#39;s now a professor at, she was sometimes helpfully asked &#34;are you lost?&#34; when she was on campus. Sometimes this was because, as a woman, she didn&#39;t look like was in the right place when she was in an engineering building. Other times, it was because she looked like and talked like someone from rural Canada. Once, a security guard thought she was a homeless person who had wandered onto campus. After a few years, she picked up the right clothes and mannerisms to pass as &#34;the right kind of person&#34;, with help from her college friends, who explained to her how one is supposed to talk and dress, but when she was younger, people&#39;s first impression was that she was an admin assistant, and now their first impression is that she&#39;s a professor&#39;s wife because they don&#39;t expect a woman to be a professor in her department. She&#39;s been fairly successful, but it&#39;s taken a lot more work than it would&#39;ve for someone who looked the part.\n  Another thing that reminded me of how funny baseball scouting reports are is a conversation I had with Ben Kuhn a while back.\n  Me: it&#39;s weird how tall so many of the men at my level (senior staff engineer) are at big tech companies. In recent memory, I think I&#39;ve only been in a meeting with one man who&#39;s shorter than me at that level or above. I&#39;m only 1&#34; shorter than U.S. average! And the guy who&#39;s shorter than me has worked remotely for at least a decade, so I don&#39;t know if people really register his height. And people seem to be even taller on the management track. If I look at the VPs I&#39;ve been in meetings with, they must all be at least 6&#39; tall.   Ben: Maybe I could be a VP at a big tech company. I&#39;m 6&#39; tall!   Me: Oh, I guess I didn&#39;t know how tall 6&#39; tall is. The VPs I&#39;m in meetings with are noticeably taller than you. They&#39;re probably at least 6&#39;2&#34;?   Ben: Wow, that&#39;s really tall for a minimum. 6&#39;2&#34; is 96%-ile for U.S. adult male\n  When I&#39;ve discussed this with successful people who work in big companies of various sorts (tech companies, consulting companies, etc.), men who would be considered tall by normal standards, 6&#39; or 6&#39;1&#34;, tell me that they&#39;re frequently the shortest man in the room during important meetings. 6&#39;1&#34; is just below the median height of a baseball player. There&#39;s something a bit odd about height seeming more correlated to success as a consultant or a programmer than in baseball, where height directly conveys an advantage.One possible explanation would be due to a  halo effect, where positive associations about tall or authoritative seeming people contribute to their success.\n  When I&#39;ve seen this discussed online, someone will point out that this is because height and cognitive performance are correlated. But if we look at the literature on IQ, the correlation isn&#39;t strong enough to explain something like this. We can also observe this if we look at fields where people&#39;s mental acuity is directly tested by something other than an IQ test, such as in chess, where most top players are around average height, with some outliers in both directions. Even without looking at the data in detail, this should be expected because correlation between height and IQ is weak, with much the correlation due to the relationship at the low end  3, and the correlation between [IQ and performance in various mental tasks is also weak (some people will say that it&#39;s strong by social science standards,  but that&#39;s very weak in terms of actual explanatory power even when looking at the population level and it&#39;s even weaker at the individual level).  And then if we look at chess in particular, we can see that the correlation is weak, as expected.\n  Since the correlation is weak, and there are many more people around average height than not, we should expect that most top chess players are around average height.  If we look at the most dominant chess players in recent history, Carlsen, Anand, and Kasparov, they&#39;re 5&#39;8&#34;, 5&#39;8&#34;, and 5&#39;9&#34;, respectively (if you look at different sources, they&#39;ll claim heights of plus or minus a couple inches, but still with a pretty normal range; people often exaggerate heights; if you look at people who try to do real comparisons either via photos or in person, measured heights are often lower than what people claim their own height is  4).\n  It&#39;s a bit more difficult to find heights of go and shogi players, but it seems like the absolute  top modern players from this list I could find heights for (Lee Sedol, Yoshiharu Habu) are roughly in the normal range, with there being some outliers in both directions among elite players who aren&#39;t among the best of all time, as with chess.\n  If it were the case that height or other factors in appearance were very strongly correlated with mental performance, we would expect to see a much stronger correlation between height and performance in activities that relatively directly measure mental performance, like chess, than we do between height and career success, but it&#39;s the other way around, which seems to indicate that the halo effect from height is stronger than any underlying benefits that are correlated with height.\n  If we look at activities where there&#39;s a fair amount of gatekeeping before people are allowed to really show their skills but where performance can be measured fairly accurately and where hiring better employees has an immediate, measurable, direct impact on company performance, such as  baseball and hockey, we can see that people went with their gut instinct over data for decades after there were public discussions about how data-driven approaches found large holes in people&#39;s intuition.\n  If we then look at programming, where it&#39;s somewhere between extremely difficult and impossible to accurately measure individual performance and the impact of individual performance on company success is much less direct than in sports, what should our estimate of how accurate talent assessment be?\n  The pessimistic view is that it seems implausible that we should expect that talent assessment is better than in sports, where it took decades of there being fairly accurate and rigorous public write-ups of performance assessments for companies to take talent assessment seriously. With programming, talent assessment isn&#39;t even far enough along that anyone can write up accurate evaluations of people across the industry, so we haven&#39;t even started the decades long process of companies fighting to keep evaluating people based on personal opinions instead of accurate measurements.\n  Jobs have something equivalent to old school baseball scouting reports at multiple levels. At the hiring stage, there are multiple levels of filters that encode people&#39;s biases. A classic study on this is  Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan&#39;s paper, which found that &#34;white sounding&#34; names on resumes got more callbacks for interviews than &#34;black sounding&#34; names and that having a &#34;white sounding&#34; name on the resume increased the returns to having better credentials on the resume. Since then, many variants of this study have been done, e.g.,  resumes with white sounding names do better than resumes with Asian sounding names,  professors with white sounding names are evaluated on CVs are evaluated as having better interpersonal skills than professors with black and Asian sounding names on CVs, etc.\n  The literature on promotions and leveling is much weaker, but I and other folks who are in highly selected environments that effectively require multiple rounds of screening, each against more and more highly selected folks, such as VPs, senior (as in &#34;senior staff&#34;+) ICs, professors at elite universities, etc., have observed that filtering on height is as severe or more severe than in baseball but less severe than in basketball.\n  That&#39;s curious when, in mental endeavors where the &#34;promotion&#34; criteria are directly selected by performance, such as in chess, height appears to only be very weakly correlated to success. A major issue in the literature on this is that, in general, social scientists look at averages. In a lot of the studies, they simply produce a correlation coefficient. If you&#39;re lucky, they may produce a graph where, for each height, they produce an average of something or other. That&#39;s the simplest thing to do but this only provides a very coarse understanding of what&#39;s going on.\n  Because I like knowing how things tick, including organizations and people&#39;s opinions, I&#39;ve (informally, verbally) polled a lot of engineers about what they thought about other engineers. What I found was that there was a lot of clustering of opinions, resulting in clusters of folks that had rough agreement about who did excellent work. Within each cluster, people would often disagree about the ranking of engineers, but they would generally agree on who was &#34;good to excellent&#34;.\n  One cluster was (in my opinion; this could, of course, also just be my own biases) people who were looking at the output people produced and were judging people based on that. Another cluster was of people who were looking at some combination of height and confidence and were judging people based on that. This one was a mystery to me for a long time (I&#39;ve been asking people questions like this and collating the data out of habit, long before I had the idea to write this post and, until I recognized the pattern, I found it odd that so many people who have good technical judgment, as evidenced by their ability to do good work and make comments showing good technical judgment, highly evaluated so many people who so frequently said blatantly incorrect things and produced poorly working or even non-working systems). Another cluster was around credentials, such as what school someone went to or what the person was leveled at or what prestigious companies they&#39;d worked for. People could have judgment from multiple clusters, e.g., some folks would praise both people who did excellent technical work as well as people who are tall and confident. At higher levels, where it becomes more difficult to judge people&#39;s work, relatively fewer people based their judgment on people&#39;s output.\n  When I did this evaluation collating exercise at the startup I worked at, there was basically only one cluster and it was based on people&#39;s output, with fairly broad consensus about who the top engineers were, but I haven&#39;t seen that at any of the large companies I&#39;ve worked for. I&#39;m not going to say that means evaluation at that startup was fair (perhaps all of us were falling prey to the same biases), but at least we weren&#39;t falling prey to the most obvious biases.\n  Back to big companies, if we look at what it would take to reform the promotion system, it seems difficult to do when biased because many individual engineers are biased. Some companies have committees handle promotions in order to red\n......", "posttime": "2022-02-22 13:30:28", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "I\u2019ve been on Nexuses and Pixels since Nexus one. Stock-or-nothing was me. However, the mobile phone market has become a bit stale and innovation has slowed down. That is until the foldables started to appear and slowly becoming reliable.\n  I was in need of replacing my aging Pixel 4 and after watching Marques\u2019 video I decided to face my old dislike and go for a Samsung device. The form factor definitely made the phone interesting, although costly.\n The phone arrived and to my surprise Samsung software had become bearable, even likable over the years since I last tried it. I swapped out my Pixel and the Flip became my daily driver. I started to really like the phone. Foldables will definitely have a place in the future line-up of smartphones.\n  All was looking good and in 3 months in I was happy with my purchase. But then\u2026\n  One day, I took the phone out of my pocket and the screen had a black part in the middle and the top half no longer responded to touch. When I got home the black part has expanded and kept growing. The screen clearly had failed from the fold. But hey, no worries, I had not dropped the phone, it was in case and I\u2019ve only used the phone the way I\u2019ve always used my other phones. So I\u2019ll just send it to Samsung for repairs and all is good. Folding is still new tech so shit happens, I didn\u2019t really mind.. until I received a response from Samsung repair:\n Based on the information you have provided, we have contacted our service partner to obtain more detailed information regarding the repair.\n During the technical inspection of your device, the technician was able to determine that in addition to the display, the frame is also broken and that this damage is due to a mechanical impact, such as a fall, bending or excessive pressure.\n So what\u2019s the damage? This is what Samsung service claims as damage stopping them from repairing the phone:\n  As the picture Samsung sent doesn\u2019t really tell what size damage it really is, here is a better picture of the same scratch:\n  The screens on these foldables are not glass. They\u2019re plastic. Soft plastic. So this scratch is probably caused by a grain of sand in my pocket about a month ago. It has had no impact to the phone\u2019s use.\n     There you go. I call bullshit on Samsung. I know I\u2019ve not dropped the phone or done anything I\u2019d see unreasonable with the phone. It is barely 3 months old of which the last 2 months it was in the official Samsung case.\n That is a phone that costed 1.099,00 \u20ac lasted barely 3 months and Samsung wants 304,00 \u20ac to fix the screen, which I still maintain broke in normal use and not by some damage caused by me as Samsung claims.\n So fuck that. I\u2019ll not give a single penny to that company, ever again. To make sure I don\u2019t change my mind, I framed the phone, including the warranty repair rejection email to have on my desk to remind me of this forever:\n  OK, it\u2019s one phone, one bad customer service experience. I know a lot of people who have had a great experience with Samsung hardware and their customer service. So why does this one matter so much that I bothered to to write about it? Let me explain why this is a really big deal in my opinion, when it comes to Samsung\u2019s attitude towards their customers and new technology.\n Foldables are still in early stages. As I already mentioned, folding phones is a great idea. As with any new technology it takes time to iron out early problems. Things break, need to be fixed, improved etc. That\u2019s all fine! I wasn\u2019t angry when the phone broke, I was angry when it wasn\u2019t repaired.\n The issue I have with this is the company policy forcing the Samsung repair-center team to reject warranty repair in this case. Samsung should adjust their policies when it comes to these new phones and the unknowns with them. What they\u2019re doing currently is forcing their early-adopter customers to bear the risks of the new technology. With a device like this the policy should be leaning much more towards the customer\u2019s side. A foldable warranty repair should be rejected only when it is extremely obvious that there was damage caused by the user. They should be protecting their technology reputation by taking the responsibility of it. That is where my issue with all this lies. If this would have been an S22, I\u2019d be annoyed but not this disappointed.\n  \u2026 Also, Samsung, the GDPR removal request I sent didn\u2019t seem to have any impact, don\u2019t make me ask again.", "posttime": "2022-02-22 13:27:09", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u624b\u673a,\u4e09\u661f,samsung", "title":

"note_en": "Lately I have been trying to get through the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&#39;s big report, the one that came out late last year, called \u201c Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis.\u201d It&#39;s a challenge because (a) I must, um, learn as I go, and (b) the PDF is nearly 4,000 pages of aggregated, footnoted, illustrated scientific consensus about weather. That&#39;s too much consensus;  everyone agrees. Yet obviously they\u2014the hundreds of IPCC-affiliated scientists who compiled this behemoth\u2014 want us to read it, right? The thing exists, so I should at least try. Plus it&#39;s free to download. I love a bargain.\n However, the gigantic PDF broke my e-reader. In time I got it to work, but the font was too small. So I used a command-line program called mutool to split each page in half, and now I can read the book in landscape mode with bigger type, a little hack of which I am embarrassingly proud\u2014although the resulting document is nearly 8,000 pages long.\n  Eight kilopages is a lot, but a very long book is still a book: You start at the beginning, skip the intro pages, skim over the \u201cSummary for Policymakers,\u201d jump forward 7,000 pages or so and read a little from \u201cAnnex V: Monsoons.\u201d OK, so maybe it&#39;s not really a book, more of a database that results from a complicated bureaucratic process. I make it a few pages at a time, until my brain refuses to go any further without a  Twitter break.\n  Frustrated by my slow progress, I started to use Twitter to look up the climate scientists themselves, click through their timelines. It&#39;s a good way to see what they&#39;re about\u2014to pick up social signals that might bring the rest of their network into better focus. As you&#39;d expect from a group of extremely smart literal cloud people, they aren&#39;t exactly dank memelord true posters. Some speak in press releases; some like to share science news. Yet personal details always leak out\u2014kids and spouses and the like. You see their little avatar faces, come across some artifact like a Spotify playlist, witness their naked enthusiasm for glaciers. Reading through this stuff, I definitely feel like I&#39;m creeping.\n I think this sort of filthy spyhood\u2014peepreading\u2014is a particularly  internettish way of learning. Like when you wake up and all the social media posts circulating in your peer group are suddenly about  a thing, but you don&#39;t know what the  thing is. Most of the time the tweets are elliptical, like \u201cCouldn&#39;t happen to a nicer columnist\u201d or \u201cJust shows you what actually goes on in the mineralogy community.\u201d In fact, the vaguer they are, the more likely the thing is to be really bad and/or salacious. So now you have to\u2014no higher priority\u2014blow up your morning and use context clues to unpack the scandal, poking around the network, seeing who liked what, pasting tweets into your group chats to see if anyone has any insight, until you find out who has been called out for what by a now-locked account, with the end result being, of course, that you  do figure it out, some squalid nasty thing someone said or did, and, welp, you can go about your day and wait for the story to show up in an essay about cancel culture.\n  I&#39;m not proud of this. I just  do it. Sometimes it&#39;s the only way to learn about subcultures and communities. When you&#39;re researching software history, which is something I like to do, you have to venture into copyright-dubious Discords and peculiar archive-focused websites and lurk around until you find out how to get the good stuff. You have to page through a bunch of gossip, drama, fights over whether emulating old computers in software is \u201creal\u201d or not. And if you lurk long enough, read enough forum threads, someone will post a temporary link to the special Google doc filled with links to confusingly titled zip files. The internet turns the world into a puzzle you must solve to feel safe. It&#39;s scary, of course, but when you solve the puzzle you feel an unbelievable sense of control. (This is also, alas, how you get QAnon.)\n  But being a sneakbrowser is also just who I am. Owing to cowardice, extraordinary shyness, or perhaps toxic masculinity (choose whichever works for you), I&#39;d rather spy for a year than ask a direct question. This is an unfortunate quality in a journalist. The job of a journalist is to call smart people and ask them to explain things. Those people  have to talk to you because it helps their careers. I find that I always slightly misunderstand what they tell me; I get the tone wrong, and then they send corrective emails that pulp my soul. I do better looking at the artifacts of a civilization than participating in it. Twitter, newsletters, Slacks, Discords: Lurking is learning.\n  So give me a network and the tools to read it. Give me the textbook called  Web Markup Languages Produced in Anger, the anthology of GitHub messages called  You Can&#39;t Program in Lisp Because You&#39;re an Idiot, the climate report called \u201cEnergy-Systems People and Earth-Systems People: The Longest Thread.\u201d\n  There&#39;s a software truism, credited to former Microsoft Windows head Steven Sinofsky, that says \u201cDon&#39;t ship your org chart.\u201d In other words, build products (or websites) for users; don&#39;t make them figure out which department in your organization does what. But everyone ships their org chart. And thank God, because if I want to understand an organization, sometimes I spider its entire website using a command-line tool called wget. You can tell what makes a place tick just from the folder structure\u2014how many blog posts, how much news it produces, whether it sorts by day or month, the sheer number of folders, all the different corners of the operation. Does the design change between departments? Is there a charismatic leader who shows up everywhere? What web host are they using? (The IPCC website, for its part, is about 15 gigs, has PDFs going back decades, uses WordPress, and has caching turned on\u2014all signs of health.) Please, world: Keep shipping your org chart.\n  Now, look. I do come by some of my climate knowledge legitimately. I ask questions. I attend Zoom seminars and learn about REMO climate models. I&#39;ve read multiple textbooks (well, sections of them). But the information so rarely sticks that way. I feel like the internet has made me immune to coherent narrative. So while I thought I was going to read the IPCC PDF and learn about the planet, of course I can&#39;t do that. I&#39;ve turned into a paranoid basement detective, using digital string and note cards to figure out how the world works.\n When people ask me what I am reading these days, I usually fish around for a credible answer, but the truth is \u201cthis one mailing list from 1999\u201d or \u201ca really good GitHub commit thread that blew up terribly.\u201d I learn by browsing until I forget what I didn&#39;t understand. This method can be frustrating to witness, and it has not led me to be the most deadline-driven of mammals, but it&#39;s a fantastic hobby. Maybe one day I&#39;ll make it 100 pages into \u201cClimate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis.\u201d But by the time you read this, IPCC Working Group II may have released its report on \u201cclimate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability\u201d\u2014i.e., the bad, scary stuff. This document will also, according to the outline agreed upon in 2017, be many kilopages. Sadly, I&#39;m looking forward to it.\n     \ud83d\udcf1 Torn between the latest phones?

LOUIS (AP) \u2014 A flaw in a state database that allowed public access to thousands of teachers\u2019 Social Security numbers has been in place for a decade before a St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter exposed it, according to a report that was released Monday.\n Republican Gov. Mike Parson  condemned  reporter Josh Renaud last fall for writing about the weakness, even though the paper refrained doing so until after the state could fix it. Parson also said the Missouri State Highway Patrol would conduct an investigation, which culminated in the 158-page report that was released Monday.\n The St. Louis Post-Dispatch  reports that DESE spokeswoman Mallory McGowin told the patrol that Renaud hadn\u2019t accessed \u201canything that was not publicly available, nor was he in a place he should not have been.\u201d\n  According to the report, McGowin also told investigators with the patrol that a vulnerability that left 576,000 teacher Social Security numbers exposed \u201cwould have been there since 2011, when the application was implemented.\u201d\n  The Post-Dispatch previously obtained  records  through an open records request showing that the state education commissioner initially planned to thank the newspaper for finding the problem. But the state instead issued a news release calling the reporter a \u201chacker.\u201d\n McGowin said the database \u2014 like other state computer services \u2014 is actually overseen by Parson\u2019s Office of Administration, which the governor controls.\n The highway patrol said it spent about 175 hours on the investigation. Three officers assisted in the probe. No cost estimate was provided.\n The report\u2019s release came more than a week after Cole County Prosecuting Attorney Locke Thompson announced  he would not be charging Renaud in connection with the investigation.\n The investigators also talked with cybersecurity expert Shaji Khan, who had verified for the Post-Dispatch that the flaw existed.\n Khan, who teaches at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said he was alarmed by the information he\u2019d received about the vulnerability.\n \u201cHe (Khan) stated by the time he was done looking, he realized how bad the situation was and indicated the state needed to be notified immediately,\u201d the report notes.\n Khan\u2019s attorney, Elad Gross, said last week that Thompson would not be charging Khan either.\n \u201cGovernor Mike Parson had no basis to instigate a criminal investigation into reporter Josh Renaud or cybersecurity expert Dr. Shaji Khan. These Missourians responsibly reported a security flaw on a public website that transmitted teachers\u2019 social security numbers to every website visitor. They did the right thing,\u201d Gross said in a statement.", "posttime": "2022-02-22 13:00:30", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "For more than a year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has collected data on hospitalizations for Covid-19 in the United States and broken it down by age, race and vaccination status.  But it has not made most of the information public.\n When the C.D.C. published the first significant data on the effectiveness of boosters in adults younger than 65 two weeks ago, it  left out the numbers for a huge portion of that population: 18- to 49-year-olds, the group the data showed was least likely to benefit from extra shots, because the first two doses already left them well-protected.\n The agency recently debuted a dashboard of  wastewater data on its website that will be updated daily and might provide early signals of an oncoming surge of Covid cases. Some states and localities had been sharing wastewater information with the agency since the start of the pandemic, but it had never before released those findings.\n Two full years into the pandemic, the agency leading the country\u2019s response to the public health emergency has published only a tiny fraction of the data it has collected, several people familiar with the data said.\n  Much of the withheld information could help state and local health officials better target their efforts to bring the virus under control. Detailed, timely data on hospitalizations by age and race would help health officials identify and help the populations at highest risk. Information on hospitalizations and death by age and vaccination status would have helped inform whether healthy adults needed booster shots. And wastewater surveillance across the nation would spot outbreaks and emerging variants early.\n Without the booster data for 18- to 49-year-olds, the outside experts whom federal health agencies look to for advice had to rely on numbers from Israel to make their recommendations on the shots.\n Kristen Nordlund, a spokeswoman for the C.D.C., said the agency has been slow to release the different streams of data \u201cbecause basically, at the end of the day, it\u2019s not yet ready for prime time.\u201d She said the agency\u2019s \u201cpriority when gathering any data is to ensure that it\u2019s accurate and actionable.\u201d\n  Dr. Daniel Jernigan, the agency\u2019s deputy director for public health science and surveillance said the pandemic exposed the fact that data systems at the C.D.C., and at the state levels, are outmoded and not up to handling large volumes of data. C.D.C. scientists are trying to modernize the systems, he said.", "posttime": "2022-02-22 12:51:20", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "In November,  the company raised $60 million in equity and debt for its Series B, which it used to fund further software development and more vehicles to expand. The additional funds, which bring Zoomo\u2019s total funding up to $101.5 million, will be used for much of the same purpose, specifically hiring more team members globally and investing into further fleet and vehicle management offerings for both mechanics and customers, as well as developing an end rider app, Mina Nada, co-founder and CEO at Zoomo, told TechCrunch.\n The startup is also continuing development and rollout of its new high performance utility e-bike, the Zoomo One, and is investing in new vehicle form-factors and accessories.\n  Zoomo offers its e-bikes as a flexible, weekly subscription for gig workers for anywhere from $20 per week to $35 per week in the U.S., which includes servicing and support. Often those prices can be cheaper if a gig worker is signing up through a partnership with one of the app-based delivery companies like UberEats or DoorDash. It also provides fleets of e-bikes (and third-party manufactured mopeds, in some markets), as well as fleet management software, to enterprise customers like Domino\u2019s.\n Since Zoomo was founded in 2017, it has expanded to 16 cities in six countries across North America, Asia Pacific and Europe, with Spain, France and Germany being added to the list just last year. The startup says its revenue grew 4x globally and its enterprise business grew 20x in 2021, but up from what, it didn\u2019t clarify.\n \u201c2021 was a transformative year for Zoomo, as we saw enterprises and fleet managers, in addition to gig-workers, benefit from our innovative platform,\u201d Nada said in a statement. \u201c2022 is the year we take the business up a gear\u2026At Zoomo, we see a world within the next decade where every last-mile delivery will be completed on a light electric vehicle supported by the Zoomo ecosystem. Our investors will help bring us one step closer to making this a reality.\u201d\n The raise was led by Collaborative Fund, with strategic investors MUFG Innovation Partners, SG Fleet, Akuna Capital and Wind Ventures also joining the round. This is the first time Zoomo has secured strategic funding, and marks the potential for future benefitial partnerships and initiatives, particularly in Latin America and Japan \u2013 Wind is the venture capital arm of COPEC, one of LatAm\u2019s largest energy and forestry companies, and MUFG is the corporate VCarm of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group\u2019s Open Innovation Strategy.", "posttime": "2022-02-22 12:11:07", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7535\u52a8,delivery,zoomo", "title": "\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u82f1\u91cc\u4ea4\u4ed8\u7535\u52a8\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546Zoomo\u5411B\u7cfb\u5217\u8ffd\u52a02000\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tLast mile delivery e-bike supplier Zoomo tacks on $20M to Series B\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/21/last-mile-delivery-e-bike-supplier-zoomo-tacks-on-20m-to-series-b/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7535\u52a8", "delivery", "zoomo"]}]
