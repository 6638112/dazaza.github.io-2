In an adapted excerpt, the author of  Madhouse at the End of the Earth  examines the many cases of psychosis that have since afflicted year-round Antarctic personnel and asks, What is it about the southernmost continent that makes people go insane?</p><p>比利珍的令人痛苦的故事，在1890年代陷入南极海冰中的速度快，揭示了星球最敌对的环境中的隔离可能导致最强硬的探险家失去主意。在一个改进的摘录中，地球结束时的麦克豪的作者检查了许多精神病的病例，这些精神病患者以来，这是令人沮丧的全年南极人员，并问道，这是什么让人疯狂的大陆？</p><p> On August 16, 1897, more than twenty thousand people flocked to the Antwerp waterfront to see off the  Belgica, a three-mast whaleship setting sail for the largely uncharted waters of Antarctica. Led by 31-year-old Adrien de Gerlache, the Belgian Antarctic Expedition was to be the first scientific mission into the void at the bottom of world maps. Seven months later, the  Belgica was caught in the pack ice of the Bellingshausen sea, and her men were condemned to be the first to endure an Antarctic winter. The sun set for the last time on May 17. Through seventy days of darkness, during which the men were unable to stray from the ship for fear of never finding it again, their bodies and minds began to break down. The expedition’s American surgeon, Dr. Frederick Cook, observed the suffering around him with an anthropologist’s eye. His description of the men’s mental anguish might have applied to any number of polar missions in the years since the  Belgica. “The long…night with its potential capacity for tragedy makes a madhouse of every polar camp,” he would later write. “Here men love and hate each other in a passion which defies description. Murder, suicide, starvation, insanity, icy death and all the acts of the devil, become regular mental pictures.”</p><p> 1897年8月16日，超过2万人蜂拥到安特卫普海滨，以查看比利珍，这是一个三桅杆鲸鱼环境，为南极洲的主要未知水域。由31岁的Adrien de Gerlache领导，比利时南极探险队是世界地图底部的第一个科学任务。七个月后，比利珍被夹在Bellingshausen海的冰上，她的男人被谴责成为第一个忍受南极冬季的冰。今年5月17日最后一次晒太阳。通过七十天的黑暗，在此期间，这些人无法偏离船只，因为害怕再也找不到它，他们的身体和思想开始分解。探险队的美国外科医生弗雷德里克厨师博士，观察了他周围的痛苦与人类学家的眼睛。他对男性的精神痛苦的描述可能会在比利克以来的几年内应用于任何数量的极地任务。 “长时间......患有其剧烈能力的夜晚让每个极地阵营的疯子，”他稍后会写。 “在这里，男人在蔑视描述的激情中彼此热爱和讨厌。谋杀，自杀，饥饿，疯狂，冰冷的死亡和魔鬼的所有行为，成为普通的心理照片。“</p><p> Every man aboard hoped that the return of the sun in late July (seasons are inverted in the southern hemisphere) would ease the shipwide distress. Instead, symptoms grew more severe as it became obvious that the sun’s rays were insufficient to loosen the ice’s grip on the  Belgica. For several men, in what would become a familiar pattern in Antarctica over the next 120 years, anguish gave way to insanity.</p><p> 船上的每个人都希望7月底的太阳回归（季节在南半球倒在南半球）会缓解造船困境。相反，症状变得更加严重，因为它显而易见的是，太阳的光线不足以松开对比比克的冰块。对于几名男子，在未来120年内将成为南极洲的熟悉模式，痛苦让位于疯狂。</p><p>  As the forecastle was coming to life on the morning of August 7, 1898, the young Belgian sailor Jan Van Mirlo, his eyes glistening with fear, handed a note to the second engineer, Max Van Rysselberghe:</p><p>  由于预测在1898年8月7日的早晨来到生命，年轻的比利时水手Jan Van Mirlo，他的眼睛用恐惧闪闪发光，向第二名工程师递交了一张笔记，Max Van Rysselgerghe：</p><p>    Van Rysselberghe was flabbergasted. He at first suspected a hoax—Van Mirlo was notorious for his histrionics—and asked him a series of questions. When his fellow Fleming failed to respond, Van Rysselberghe took him straight to Cook’s cabin.</p><p>    范鲁西贝尔格被令人毛骨悚然。他首先涉嫌Hoax-van Mirlo对他的培养剂来说是臭名昭着的 - 并问他一系列问题。当他的弗莱明未能回应时，Van Rysselberghe将他直接烹制烹饪的小屋。</p><p>  After examining the patient, the doctor concluded that there was nothing wrong with Van Mirlo’s ears or vocal cords. The problem was with his mind. He was experiencing a hysterical crisis that was likely to get worse in the next few days. Cook ordered Van Mirlo’s crewmates to discreetly keep an eye on him, in two-hour shifts, even at night.</p><p>  在检查病人后，医生得出结论，范米尔乐的耳朵或声带没有错。问题在他的脑海里。他正在经历一个歇斯底里的危机，在接下来的几天可能会变得更糟。 Cook订购了van Mirlo的船员，谨慎地关注他，在两小时的轮班中，即使在晚上也是如此。</p><p>  The deckhand recovered his speech and hearing within a week, but not his reason. Among the first things he said when he rediscovered his voice was that he was going to murder his superior, chief engineer Henri Somers, as soon as he had the chance.</p><p>  Deckhand在一周内恢复了他的讲话和听证会，但不是他的理由。在他重新发现他的声音时，他说的第一件事是他将谋杀他的优越，首席工程师Henri Somers，一旦他有机会就立即。 </p><p> Van Mirlo’s psychosis struck his shipmates at their core. His unraveling escalated the sense of terror that had been simmering on board for months. He was simultaneously an augury of the worst that the men feared for themselves and a vector of fear. If he said he would murder Somers, what was to stop him from changing his mind and killing someone else? Now the expeditioners had to worry not only about “the elements conjured against us,” wrote the  Belgica’s captain, Georges Lecointe, but also “this man who was irresponsible for his actions.” The sailor’s condition was a particularly extreme manifestation of shipwide unease, an acting-out of the panic that most were barely managing to keep contained.</p><p>van mirlo的精神病患者在他们的核心击中了他的船。他的解开升级了几个月的恐怖感。他同时成为最糟糕的陪计人民害怕自己和恐惧的传染媒介。如果他说他会谋杀萨默，那是什么阻止他从改变他​​的思想并杀死别人？现在，探险者不得不担心“对我们有魅力的要素”，写了比比里卡的队长，乔治·莱切，也是“这个不负责任的行为”。水手的病情是造船的一个特别极端的表现，即大多数人几乎无法遏制所遏制的恐慌。</p><p>  Soon after, another sailor, Adam Tollefsen, began showing signs of severe paranoia. The Norwegian boatswain was among the most experienced and dependable seamen on the ship. He was accustomed to the cold and the dark, having worked in the Arctic, and had performed his duties with skill, intelligence, and zeal. The  Belgica’s first mate, a fellow Norwegian named Roald Amundsen, was especially fond of Tollefsen. But in his diary on November 28, Amundsen acknowledged that the boatswain “displayed some very strange symptoms today which are indicative of insanity.” That night, Tollefsen had asked him if he was truly aboard the  Belgica. When Amundsen answered that yes, he was, Tollefsen looked perplexed and said he had no memory of embarking on the ship.</p><p>  不久之后，另一个水手，亚当托勒芬，开始显示严重偏执的迹象。挪威船长是船上最有经验和可靠的海员之一。他习惯于寒冷，黑暗，在北极工作，并履行了他的职责，智慧和热情。 Belgica的第一个伴侣是一个名叫Roald Amundsen的挪威语，特别喜欢Tollefsen。但在他的日记于11月28日，Amundsen承认，船长“今天展示了一些非常奇怪的症状，这表明了疯狂。”那天晚上，Tollefsen问他是否真的是乘坐比利尼察。当Amundsen回答说是的时，他是，Tollefsen看起来很困惑，并说他没有记忆在船上开始。</p><p> Tollefsen’s protuberant eyes darted nervously at every creak of the hull, every pop in the ice. He experienced ferocious headaches and kept his thickly bearded jaw clenched at all times, as if bracing for imminent disaster. Tollefsen grew so suspicious of the other crewmembers that he retreated to dark corners of the ship. He avoided the forecastle at night and slept instead in the freezing hold, among the rats, without a bedcover or proper winter clothes. “His spirit is troubled by delusions of grandeur and mad terrors,” observed Lecointe. “Odd mystery: the word ‘ chose’ [French for ‘thing’] infuriates him. Since he doesn’t speak French, he imagines that ‘chose’ means  kill and that his companions have given each other the signal to execute him.”</p><p> Tollefsen的突起眼睛在船上的每个吱吱声上紧张地猛烈地飞动，每次冰都在冰上。他经历了凶猛的头痛，并保持着厚厚的大胡子，始终紧握，好像是迫在眉睫的灾难。 Tollefsen对他撤退到船的黑暗角落的其他船长感到困扰。他在晚上避开了预测，而是在大鼠中睡觉而不是冰盖，没有床杯或适当的冬天衣服。 “他的精神被妄想和疯狂的恐惧的妄想困扰着”，“莱克观察。 “奇怪的谜团：”选择“这个词[法国人''''''']激怒了他。由于他不会说法语，他想象“选择”意味着杀戮，他的同伴互相赋予了执行他的信号。“</p><p> Tollefsen had to be watched at all times, lest he attempt to strike first at those he believed meant to harm him. His friend Jan Van Mirlo, still reeling from his own psychotic episode, volunteered to be his guardian. Van Mirlo believed that Tollefsen had begun to act bizarrely after the death in June of one of the  Belgica’s officers, Emile Danco. “He became shy,” recalled Van Mirlo, and “was continuously writing letters to his beloved ‘Agnes’ in which he wrote about all his misery here on the ice and about his persecution at the hands of his shipmates.” According to Van Mirlo, Tollefsen would place these letters in a mound of snow that resembled a mailbox. “To give him pleasure, we went to retrieve the letters and told them they were on their way to Agnes.”</p><p> Tollefsen必须随时观看，以免他在那些他认为意味着伤害他的人中首先罢工。他的朋友Jan Van Mirlo，仍然从自己的精神病剧集中卷入，自愿成为他的监护人。范米尔洛认为Tollefsen在6月的死亡之后开始行动，其中一位比利提官员，Emile Danco。 “他变得害羞，”梵德洛召回，“不断地写信给他心爱的'艾格尼丝'，他在冰上撰写了他的所有痛苦，以及他在他的船只手中的迫害。”根据范米洛，Tollefsen会将这些字母放在类似邮箱的土墩中。 “为了给他愉快，我们去了检索信并告诉他们他们正在前往艾格尼丝的路上。”</p><p> Tollefsen’s mental state deteriorated drastically during the month of November. “He doesn’t speak, his eyes look vacant, and the only task we can entrust him with is to scrape sealskins,” wrote Lecointe. “Even then, he barely progresses in this work: after ten minutes, he drums on the skin with his knife, looking with a bewildered air in the direction of distant pressure ridges.” If anyone approached him, Tollefsen would shudder and instinctively bow his head, “as if to receive the coup de grâce.”</p><p> Tollefsen的精神状态在11月份的月份急剧恶化。 “他不会说话，他的眼睛看起来空缺，我们可以委托他的唯一任务是刮去Sealskins，”莱特特写道。 “即使那么，他也几乎没有进展这项工作：十分钟后，他用刀子鼓在皮肤上，看着距离遥远的压力脊的方向令人困惑的空气。”如果有人接近他，Tollefsen会颤抖，本能地鞠躬，“仿佛接受政变。”</p><p>  If the literature of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries—by the likes of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Mary Shelley, Edgar Allan Poe, and Jules Verne—imagined a link between the polar regions and insanity, the  Belgica expedition confirmed it. The decades of frenzied Antarctic exploration that followed the voyage cemented the continent’s reputation as an inherently maddening place. Still today in Antarctic research stations, as modern amenities dull the ferocity of the environment and digital communications keep year-round personnel in touch with the outside world, madness lurks in the corridors.</p><p>  如果第十八世纪和十九世纪的文献 - 由塞缪尔泰勒罗德里德，玛丽·谢尔利，埃德加·艾伦普，和朱尔斯·弗尼斯 - 想象极地地区和疯狂之间的联系，比利提卡探险证实了它。疯狂的南极勘探数十年，随后的航行将大陆的声誉作为一个自然的疯狂的地方。今天仍然在南极研究站，随着现代化设施沉闷的环境和数字通信的凶猛保持全年人员与外界联系，走廊里的疯狂潜伏。</p><p> The English explorer Frank Wild, who traveled to Antarctica several times, including with Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton in the early 1900s, admitted in his unpublished memoirs that the psychological toll of polar expeditions had gone largely unreported: “When leaders of Expeditions write up their books, they usually give the impression that their parties were composed of archangels &amp; that rows &amp; differences never occurred,” wrote Wild. “In all of my six expeditions quarrels &amp; squabbles have taken place, &amp; men’s tempers most naturally become frayed when herded together in close quarters under the trying conditions of a polar winter.”</p><p> 前往南极洲的英国探险家弗兰克狂野，包括与罗伯特·弗尔康斯科特和欧内斯特Shacklelon在19世纪初，在他未发表的备忘录中承认，极地探险的心理造价在很大程度上未报告：“当探险领导人时，会写作他们的书籍，他们通常给人一种印象，即他们的各方由Archangels＆amp组成;那行＆amp;差异从未发生过，“狂野写道。 “在我所有的六次探险中争吵＆amp;争吵已经发生，＆amp;当在极地冬季的日志居住在近距离在近距离在一起时，男人的脾气最自然地磨损。“ </p><p>  In the extreme conditions of the Antarctic, these crises could trigger violent impulses. During Scott’s  Discovery expedition to the Ross Sea, in the winter of 1902, “one man’s mind gave way,” Wild wrote. “One evening during bad weather he was missed. A search party was organised by one man going straight out from the ship with a rope; before he got out of sight in the drift, another took hold of the line &amp; so on until some two hundred yards of rope was paid out, then the party commenced a sweeping movement round the ship. The missing man was found a short distance ahead of the ship with a crowbar in his hand. When asked what he was doing there he said ‘Well, I knew a search party would be sent out for me, &amp; I hoped – (here he named a man with whom he had quarrelled) would find me, &amp; I was going to brain him with this bar’.”</p><p>在南极的极端条件下，这些危机可能引发暴力冲动。在斯科特在罗斯大海的发现探险期间，在1902年的冬天，“一个人的心灵给出了道路，”疯狂写道。 “在恶劣天气期间，他错过了一个晚上。一名搜索派对由一个人从船上直接从船上直接出来;在他在漂移的视线下走出视线之前，另一个抓住了线条＆amp;因此，直到大约两千米的绳子得到了支付，那么党开始了船上的扫地运动。在他手中用撬棍前面发现失踪的男人很短的距离。当被问及他在那里做了什么，他说，我知道一个搜索派对会被送出我，＆amp;我希望 - （在这里他将一个与他争吵的人命名）会找到我，＆amp;用这个酒吧'，我会脑子脑子。“</p><p> People who go mad in the Antarctic tend to go mad in similar ways. Those affected are prone to hallucinations and paranoid delusions. They often stray from the ship or the base without notifying their colleagues, as if they believed they could walk back to civilization. And they are typically obsessed with violence, either threatening murder (like Van Mirlo) or fearing it (like Tollefsen)—or both.</p><p> 在南极疯狂的人往往以类似的方式生气。受影响的人易患幻觉和偏执妄想。他们经常从船上或基地流失而不通知他们的同事，好像他们认为他们可以回到文明。他们通常痴迷于暴力，威胁谋杀案（如van mirlo）或担心它（如tollefsen）-or两者。</p><p> Sidney Jeffryes was a wireless radio operator on the Australian explorer Douglas Mawson’s Australasian Antarctic Expedition (1911-1914). After months holed up with four other men in a hut on Cape Denison—an outcropping of George V Land, immediately south of Australia, that Mawson rightly called “the windiest place on earth”—Jeffryes suffered a mental breakdown. He began ranting incoherently and picking fights with his companions. After brawling with one of them, he asked another to “be his second if he did any shooting.” All firearms and ammunition were immediately hidden from him. Jeffryes “surely must be going off his base,” Mawson wrote in his diaries. “During the day he sleeps badly, gets up for dinner looking bad, husky; mutters sitting on his bunk in the dark afterward.“ Jeffryes became convinced, as Tollefsen had been, that his fellow expeditioners wanted to kill him, and nothing they could say could disabuse him of the notion. Months later, it was discovered that Jeffryes had secretly been sending radio communications to a station on Macquarie island to report that it was his colleagues who had gone mad. 1 He was relieved of his position and only recovered once he was back in Australia.</p><p> Sidney Jeffryes是澳大利亚探险家Douglas Mawson的澳大利亚南极探险（1911-1914）的无线无线电运营商。几个月后，在丹尼森开普斯丹尼斯的四个其他男人身上 - 一个乔治V土地的露头，马森正当地称为“地球上最大的地方”-Jeffryes遭受了精神崩溃。他开始咆哮不连贯，并与他的同伴采摘战斗。在与其中一个人争吵之后，他向另一个人询问“如果他做了射击，就会成为他的第二个。”所有枪支和弹药都立即隐藏起来。 “杰弗雷斯”肯定必须要走出他的基地，“Mawson在他的日记中写道。 “白天他睡得很糟糕，哈西斯的晚餐看起来很糟糕;嘀咕着坐在他的铺上的黑暗之后。“杰弗里斯变得相信，因为Tollefsen一直是他的同伴想杀死他，而且他们所能说的任何东西都可以欺骗他的概念。几个月后，有人发现，杰弗里斯偷偷地向麦格里岛上的车站发送了无线电通信，以报告他是他疯狂的同事。 1他的立场释放了他的立场，只有一旦他回到澳大利亚一次才能康复。</p><p> 1Another member of Mawson’s expedition, Xavier Mertz, became delirious following a grueling overland journey during which he and Mawson were forced to shoot and eat some of their beloved dogs to survive. Mertz raved and thrashed in their tent, soiled himself repeatedly, and chewed off the tip of his frostbitten finger to prove his courage. He died later that day. It has been suggested that his mental symptoms and his death were caused by an excess of vitamin A, found in high concentration in the livers of huskies.</p><p> 1个穆森探险队的其他成员，泽维尔·默兹在艰苦的陆上旅程之后，他和马森被迫射击并吃一些心爱的狗来生存。默兹在他们的帐篷里咆哮着，反复弄脏自己，并咀嚼着他冰球的尖端，以证明他的勇气。那天晚些时候他去世了。有人提出，他的精神症状和他的死亡是由过量的维生素A引起的，在哈士奇的肝脏中高浓度。</p><p> By 1928, when the celebrated American naval pilot and explorer Richard Byrd was planning his first expedition to Antarctica, the idea that the continent drove men to violence and insanity had become so common that he thought to bring along two coffins and twelve straightjackets.</p><p> 到1928年，当庆祝的美国海军飞行员和探险者理查德·伯德（Richard Byrd）计划他的第一次向南极洲的探险时，这是大陆驱使男人暴力和疯狂的想法变得如此普遍，他认为他认为沿着两个棺材和十二件直刀具。</p><p> Instances of madness occurred throughout the twentieth century, even as the infrastructure of research bases developed, making personnel less likely to suffer from the harshness of the elements. A few cases stand out. In 1955, a member of the Naval Construction Battalion assigned to build the first American base on the continent, at McMurdo Sound, became paranoid. Fearing that his psychosis would destabilize the rest of the crew, his commanding officers had a special cell built for him next to the infirmary, lined with mattresses to muffle the sound of his mad ravings.</p><p> 疯狂的情况在二十世纪中发生，即使作为研究基地的基础设施，也使得人们不太可能遭受这些元素的严峻性。一些案件脱颖而出。 1955年，一名海军建筑营的成员分配在麦克马多的声音，成为大陆的第一个美国基地，成为偏执狂。担心他的精神病症会使船员的其余部分稳定下来，他的指挥官有一个特殊的细胞，为他旁边的医务室旁边，衬有床垫，以消除他疯狂的狂欢的声音。</p><p> In the early 70s the U.S. Navy began carrying out regular psychiatric evaluations of all Antarctic personnel on its bases. At each station, the clinicians found, “there was at least one and usually more episodes of actual or attempted physical aggression each year. In retrospect, these events were invariably reported at the lowest points of morale during the year and were the source of great guilt, rumination and preoccupation in the group.” But the most extreme case of emotional disorder observed during the Naval study concerned a service member who was “overtly psychotic with paranoid delusions and assaultive behaviour.” The station’s medical staff treated him with powerful sedatives and isolated him from the rest of the other personnel. “It is significant that his delusions developed in a tense emotional milieu which was marked by conscious homosexual anxiety stimulated by a schizoid, effeminate and seductive member of the group,” the report of the study added.</p><p> 70年代初，美国海军开始对其基地的所有南极人员进行常规精神病评估。在每个站，临床医生发现，“每年至少有一个和通常更多的实际或企图物理侵略的发作。回想起来，这些事件总是在年内士气的最低​​点报告，是巨大内疚，谣言和小组的关注。“但在海军研究期间观察到最极端的情绪障碍的情况有关的服务成员是“偏执狂妄想和争议行为的公开精神病”。该车站的医务人员用强大的镇静剂对待他，并从其他人员身上孤立他。 “他的妄想在紧张的情绪中，他的妄想是显着的，这是由分裂，女性化和诱人成员刺激的意识式的同性恋焦虑，”该研究的报告添加。 </p><p>  At 5 a.m. on August 22, 1978, a fire broke out in the Chapel of the Snows at McMurdo station. The station’s firefighters were unable to contain the flames, which soon consumed the entire wooden structure. Only the church bell and a few religious items could be salvaged. It was later found that the blaze had been ignited by a man who had “gone a little screwy.”</p><p>在1978年8月22日在5月22日，在McMurdo Station的雪橇教堂中爆发了火灾。该车站的消防员无法遏制火焰，这很快消耗了整个木结构。只能拯救教堂铃和一些宗教物品。后来发现火焰被一个“走了一点螺旋”的男人点燃了。</p><p> For all the threats of violence issued by unstable crewmembers, there has been, to date, only one suspected murder in Antarctica. In May 2000, Rodney Marks, a 32-year-old Australian astrophysicist wintering at the South Pole station, fell ill while walking between buildings on the compound and died 36 hours later, in wretched pain. An autopsy attributed his death to methanol poisoning; the subsequent criminal investigation could not determine whether it had been the result of suicide of foul play.</p><p> 对于不稳定的船员发出的所有暴力威胁，迄今为止，迄今为止，只有一个涉嫌在南极洲谋杀案。 2000年5月，罗德尼标志，一个32岁的澳大利亚天体物理学家在南极站越来越越来越淡，而在化合物的建筑物之间行走并在36小时后去世，在可怜的痛苦中。尸检归因于他的死亡甲醇中毒;随后的刑事调查无法确定它是否是犯规的自杀的结果。</p><p>  A recent case was more conclusive, if ultimately less deadly. On October 9, 2018, in the cafeteria of Russia’s Bellingshausen station, on King George Island, a 54-year-old engineer named Sergei Savitsky grabbed a knife and plunged it into the chest of Oleg Beloguzov, a welder with whom he’d had a history of conflict. (Beloguzov was airlifted to a hospital in Chile, where he recovered.) An unnamed source told a reporter that Savitsky had snapped after Beloguzov kept spoiling the endings of books.</p><p>  最近的一个案例更加决定，如果最终致命。 2018年10月9日，在乔治岛国王乔治岛的自助餐厅，一个54岁的工程师，一个名叫塞里索尼·塞尔吉·萨尔吉（Sergei Savitsky）抓住了一把刀，把它塞进Oleg Beloguzov的胸部，一个与他所拥有的焊接师冲突的历史。 （Beloguzov在他康复的那里乘坐智利的一家医院。）一个未命名的来源告诉记者，在Beloguzov保持破坏书籍的结尾之后，拯救了一位救世主。</p><p>  A study of 313 men and women conducted at McMurdo Station in the 1990s revealed that 5.2 percent of those surveyed suffered from a psychiatric disorder. While this rate is slightly lower than among the general population of the United States, it should be noted that all station personnel are rigorously screened for such disorders before arriving. The Antarctic had made them lose their bearings.</p><p>  在20世纪90年代McMurdo站进行了313名男女的研究表明，5.2％的调查患有精神疾病。虽然这个速度略低于美国的一般人口中，但应该指出，在到达之前，所有车站人员都严格筛查此类疾病。南极使他们失去了轴承。</p><p> What is it about Antarctica that seems to dissolve the bonds of sanity? An official report of the  Belgica expedition, published in Brussels in 1904, offered an explanation that could have been written by Poe: “One sailor had fits of hysteria which bereft him of reason. Another, witnessing the pressure of the ice, was smitten with terror and went mad at the spectacle of the weird-sublime and in dread of pursuing fate.” It’s tempting to see, as authors from Coleridge to Verne to Lovecraft do, a dark poetry to polar madness, a correspondence between the highest latitudes of the earth and the deepest corners of the mind. Yet the romantic notions that a place can exert a maddening force, or that insanity is the penalty of hubris, or that the very blankness of the landscape forces men to face their innermost fears, don’t hold up to scientific scrutiny. The etiology of mental illness is rarely so symbolic.</p><p> 南极洲似乎溶解理智债券是什么？ Belgica Expsionition的正式报告，1904年在布鲁塞尔出版，提供了一个由Poe撰写的解释：“一名水手拥有呼吸器的合适理性。另一个，目睹了冰的压力，被恐怖迷住，并在奇怪的崇高和恐惧追求命运的恐惧中生气了。“看看，作为沃尔尼的作者来说，看看沃尔尼对Loverraft的作者来说，一个黑暗的诗歌，成为极地疯狂的黑暗诗歌，地球最高纬度与头脑最深的角落之间的对应关系。然而，一个地方可以发挥疯狂的力量的浪漫概念，或者疯狂是哈布里斯的惩罚，或者景观势力的空白迫使男人面临最内心的恐惧，不要坚持科学审查。精神疾病的病因很少如此象征。</p><p>  Scholars today associate “polar madness,” generally speaking, with a combination of environmental factors like the cold and the dark—which can disrupt circadian rhythms and hormonal balances—and psychosocial factors, such as isolation, confinement, monotony, and the interpersonal conflicts that inevitably arise among small groups forced to spend a lot of time together. It has been observed on both ends of the earth. But a distinction must be made between winter-over syndrome, a sense of brain-fog and disorientation that amounts to a particularly acute form of cabin fever, and the rarer cases of actual psychosis, including Van Mirlo’s and Tollefsen’s. Whereas those suffering from winter-over syndrome tend to be listless and gloomy, the truly psychotic are typically frantic, paranoid, seeing enemies and danger around every corner. In many ways, their crises resemble a phenomenon observed in the Arctic not within overwintering expeditions but rather among the men and women who lived in those forbidding regions year-round.</p><p>  今天的学者们在今天助理“极地疯狂”，一般而言，具有寒冷和黑暗等环境因素的组合 - 这可能会破坏昼夜节律和荷尔蒙平衡 - 和心理社会因素，如隔离，监禁，单调和人际关系的影响不可避免地出现在小组中，被迫在一起花很多时间。已经在地球的两端观察到。但是，冬季综合症的区别是一种脑雾和迷人的感觉，这达到了特别锐尖的机舱发烧，以及罕见的实际精神病的案例，包括van mirlo和tollefsen。虽然那些患有冬季综合症的人往往是无精打采而阴沉的，但真正的精神病通常是疯狂的，偏执狂，看到每个角落的敌人和危险。在许多方面，他们的危机在北极观察到的现象不在过度遍溢的探险中，而是在始朗生活在那些禁止地区的男人和女性中。</p><p> From the 1890s until the 1920s, explorers documented dozens of cases of manic, delusional, sometimes violent behavior among the Inuhuit, the indigenous population of Northern Greenland. The Inuhuit supposedly had a word to describe such episodes:  pibloktoq. 2 “The manifestations of this disorder are somewhat startling,” wrote the American Arctic explorer Robert Peary, among the first Western explorers to describe it.</p><p> 从19世纪20年代到20世纪20年代，探险家记录了几十个躁狂，妄想，有时暴力行为的欧洲州北部土着人口。 inuhuit据说有一个词来描述这样的集：pibloktoq。 2“这种疾病的表现有点令人震惊，”美国北极探险家Robert Peary写道，第一个西部探险家描述它。 </p><p> 2The word first appears in the writing of Josephine Diebitsch-Peary, Robert Peary’s wife. She likely took liberties with the transliteration since it resembles no known term or phrase in the modern Inuhuit dialect of Northern Greenland.</p><p>2这个词首先出现在Josephine Diebitsch-Peary，Robert Peary的妻子的写作中。由于它类似于格陵兰地北部现代Inuhuit方言，她可能会带来自由。</p><p> The patient, usually a woman, begins to scream and tear off and destroy her clothing. If on the ship, she will walk up and down the deck, screaming and gesticulating, and generally in a state of nudity, though the thermometer may be in the minus forties. As the intensity of the attack increases, she will sometimes leap over the rail upon the ice, running perhaps half a mile. The attack may last a few minutes, an hour, or even more, and some sufferers become so wild that they would continue running about on the ice perfectly naked until they froze to death, if they were not forcibly brought back. When an Eskimo is attacked with  piblokto indoors, nobody pays much attention, unless the sufferer should reach for a knife or attempt to injure some one.”</p><p> 患者通常是一个女人，开始尖叫，撕掉摧毁她的衣服。如果在船上，她将在甲板上，尖叫，尖叫，尖叫，并且通常处于裸体状态，尽管温度计可能在负四十年代。随着袭击的强度增加，她有时会在冰上跳过铁轨，也许跑了半英里。攻击可能持续几分钟，一小时甚至更多，有些患者变得如此狂野，他们将继续在冰上完全赤身裸体跑步，直到他们冻结死亡，如果他们没有强行带回来。当Eskimo遭到Piblokto遭受袭击时，除非患者应该伸出刀或试图伤害一些人，否则没有人注意。“</p><p> Early on, explorers and anthropologists tended to consider  pibloktoq as integral to the identity of the Inuhuit, like an exotic version of the “hysteria” then thought primarily to afflict women. (Western doctors occasionally treated it with injections of mustard water.) Over the years, social scientists have proposed more plausible theories to explain it, none of which are fully satisfactory. Some believed it could be a form of shamanic trance, while others have attributed it to nutritional deficiency, and others still to “brooding over absent relatives or fear of the future.” Perhaps the most common explanation has been that  pibloktoq was related—like winter-over syndrome—to seasonal environmental factors, particularly to the cold and darkness of the Arctic winter.</p><p> 早期，探险家和人类学家往往将pibloktoq视为欧洲努力的身份的组成，就像一个异国情调的“歇斯底里”的形式版本，然后主要想到折磨女性。 （西医偶尔会用芥末水的注射治疗。）多年来，社会科学家们提出了更合理的理论来解释它，其中没有一个完全令人满意。有些人认为这可能是一种萨满恍惚的形式，而其他人则归因于营养缺乏，而其他人则仍然仍然“沉思不存在的亲戚或对未来的恐惧”。也许最常见的解释是pibloktoq与冬季过度综合征为季节性环境因素，特别是北极冬季的寒冷和黑暗。</p><p> Both Van Mirlo and Tollefsen were also known to flee into the cold, woefully underdressed. Could the two men have experienced an antipodal variant of  pibloktoq, one that lasted not hours but weeks, months? A current theory among social scientists suggests that  pibloktoq was not a congenital malady peculiar to the Inuhuit but rather a severe stress reaction arising from early contact with Western outsiders. While that circumstance does not apply to the men of the  Belgica—if anything, the source of their anxiety was the  lack of contact with the outside—the theory suggests that polar psychosis might be less a physiological phenomenon than a function of emotional distress, exacerbated by a bleak and unforgiving landscape.</p><p> 凡麦洛和托莱芬均众所周知，逃离寒冷，令人窒息的枯萎病。这两个人可能经历过pibloktoq的反双解膜变异，一个持续时间，但几个月，月份？社会科学家之间的目前的理论表明，PibloktoQ不是inuhuit的先天性疾病，而是从早期接触西方外人而产生的严重压力反应。虽然这种情况不适用于比利卡的男人 - 如果有的话，他们的焦虑来源是与外面的源于缺乏接触 - 理论表明，极地精神病可能不那么少于情绪痛苦的功能，加剧了通过凄凉和难以理解的景观。</p><p>  If isolation, confinement, and fear are the primary stressors in polar environments, they were especially potent on the  Belgica expedition. Since no man had experienced a winter in the Antarctic pack ice before, nobody knew what lay in store. Drifting on the fringes of a desolate continent, at the mercy of the ice’s pressures, without the possibility of rescue or communication with the rest of the world, the men of the  Belgica were among the most isolated human beings on earth.</p><p>  如果隔离，禁闭和恐惧是极地环境中的主要压力，它们特别有效地对比利卡探险。由于没有人在南极包冰中经历过冬天，因此没有人知道商店里的躺着。漂浮在荒凉大陆的条纹上，在冰冷的压力下，没有救助或与世界其他地区拯救或沟通的可能性，比利珍人是地球上最孤立的人类之一。</p><p> Adapted from MADHOUSE AT THE END OF THE EAR</p><p> 在耳朵末端的麦克福特改编</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gq.com/story/insane-in-antarctica-excerpt">https://www.gq.com/story/insane-in-antarctica-excerpt</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/南极洲/">#南极洲</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/people/">#people</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/可能/">#可能</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
