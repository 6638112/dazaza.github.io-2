www.befrienders.org \u4e0a\u627e\u5230", "note_en": "WG Sebald\u2019s writing on the Holocaust was driven by the anger and distress he felt over his father\u2019s service in Hitler\u2019s army\n    His books are saturated with despair. Over and over again, his emotionally traumatised characters are caught \u2013 inescapably \u2013 in plots that doom them to a life of anguish. Often, they kill themselves.\n Now, the psychological wounds and suicidal thoughts that blighted  WG Sebald\u2019s own life and secretly inspired him to begin writing fiction are to be laid bare for the first time in a forthcoming biography.\n  \u201cWhat lay behind his writing was this great trauma that he was expressing and suffering,\u201d said Carole Angier, author of   Speak, Silence: In Search of WG Sebald, the first major biography of the German author who wrote  The Emigrants and   Austerlitz.\n The book, which will be published later this month, sheds new light on why Sebald often chose to write about the Jewish and German tragedy of the  Holocaust.\n Lauded as one of the world\u2019s greatest writers when he died aged 57 in a car crash 20 years ago, Sebald always had a troubled relationship with his father, a German soldier who fought in the second world war, the biography will show.\n  He fought with his father \u2013 an \u201cold-fashioned authoritarian man\u201d \u2013 his whole life, but their relationship took a turn for the worse when, at the age of 17, Sebald was shown a film at school about concentration camps. It was the early 1960s, and at the time, Angier says, \u201cthe Holocaust was never spoken of in German families. That was Sebald\u2019s first visual and visceral encounter with it.\u201d\n The film traumatised him. \u201cHe saw his father as a Nazi, who had served without question in Hitler\u2019s army.\u201d\n Painfully aware that his parents had accepted and benefited from Hitler\u2019s rule, he began to find their silence on the subject agonising. \u201cHe could never get his parents to talk about the war,\u201d Angier says. \u201cHe would accuse his father, and his father would clam up and say he didn\u2019t remember. Then he would get angry and they would have a row.\u201d\n At around the same time, Sebald \u2013 who was brought up as a Catholic \u2013 began to question the church. \u201cHe became a dissenter.\u201d\n He grew depressed and eventually had a breakdown. \u201cHe said later he came \u2018close to the edge of his reason\u2019 at this time, and that this can happen if someone\u2019s identity that\u2019s been built up over many years is destroyed or falls to bits,\u201d Angier says.\n He would later explore these feelings in  Austerlitz, his final masterpiece, about a Jewish refugee whose parents perished in the Holocaust. Adopted by Christians after arriving in Britain on the  Kindertransport as a small child, the refugee discovers his Jewish identity on the brink of adulthood and then, after repressing the trauma of what happened to him, has a nervous breakdown later in life.\n Sebald hid his own breakdown from his family and never sought any formal treatment. He continued to suffer from serious episodes of depression, anxiety, panic and \u201cterrible feelings of isolation\u201d throughout his life, and ended up having three major breakdowns in total, the biography reveals for the first time.\n  The second occurred during his first term as a 22-year-old teacher at Manchester University. Overwhelmed by his feelings of alienation, hopelessness and panic, Sebald fell into another \u201cacute depression\u201d, similar to that of the narrator of Max Ferber\u2019s story in  The Emigrants. \u201cHe later confirmed that what he wrote there was true of himself, that he went through a crisis during that time.\u201d\n At the time, he confessed to a friend he thought he was \u201cgoing mad\u201d and that \u201csometimes he\u2019d like to let go, but there were people who were holding him back\u201d.\n Angier assumes this was his family: \u201cI think he was suicidal, or had suicidal thoughts, throughout his life.\u201d It was at this point that he started writing fiction. \u201cHe wrote his first novel, which has never been published. The hero is a very gloomy, hypersensitive character. It\u2019s definitely entirely based on himself \u2013 it\u2019s a very autobiographical piece.\u201d\n It was while he was teaching at Manchester University in his early 20s, in this vulnerable state that he got to know the first Jewish person he had ever met, his \u201cwonderful\u201d landlord, Peter Jordan, a German refugee. \u201cHere was a real person, who had grown up exactly like him, spoke his language, lived in the same way, skied on the same hills \u2013 and he\u2019d had to flee and his parents were murdered. Meeting him brought home to Sebald the human reality of these terrible crimes.\u201d\n Sebald \u2013 who, by this time, had started calling himself Max, instead of Winfried, his Nazi-approved birth name \u2013 was struck by one particular aspect of Jordan\u2019s behaviour. Like Sebald\u2019s parents, Jordan did not like to speak about the war.\n \u201cHe did that typical refugee thing of not thinking about it, not facing what happened to his parents. That is the story that Sebald is always telling, of these people who are both the survivors and victims of  Nazism, forced into exile, carrying a burden for the rest of their lives and trying not to think about it, to avoid trauma.\u201d In Sebald\u2019s books, however, this strategy never works.\n  Later, he wanted to reproduce in his readers the same sense of shocking reality he had felt, so he put photos of Peter Jordan and his family in  The Emigrants and pretended they belonged to his fictional character Max Ferber. \u201cThe character\u2019s history is the history of Peter Jordan and all the photographs are of his family,\u201d Angier reveals.\n Sebald\u2019s final breakdown, at the age of 35, was the most severe. On a journey through Italy, he started to imagine men were pursuing him around Verona with murderous intent. \u201cHe felt absolutely terrified and convinced that all these terrible, sinister things were happening around him.\u201d He feared he was going mad, an experience he recounts in his first published work of fiction,  Vertigo. \u201cHe was in a very, very disturbed state.\u201d\n He tells a friend later that when he visited Milan cathedral, he got to the top and \u201cnearly fell into the abyss\u201d.\n  It was this breakdown that \u201ctipped him over\u201d into serious writing. \u201cThat breakdown was crucial. It is then that he begins to write literary fiction. He fills his characters with his own despair.\u201d Writing fiction allowed him to express the trauma he was feeling and hiding from the world. \u201cHe always said he only started to write to get away from his academic routine. That was not true. He started to write to explore and deal with this terrible depression that he\u2019d fallen into. And it wasn\u2019t wholly personal, in fact the main trauma was the historical burden he was carrying.\u201d\n But Angier is keen to point out that his books also display his deadpan sense of humour. \u201cPeople think his books are incredibly pessimistic and gloomy, which they are, but he was also mordantly funny. Humour was a coping mechanism \u2013 a socially acceptable way of expressing his gloom. And he was very charming and funny in real life.\u201d\n In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by email-ing  jo@samaritans.org or  jo@samaritans.ie.

June,  Unity quietly updated its licensing policy requirements for developers working on \u201cclosed platforms\u201d like Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and Google Stadia.\n  Unity developers starting new projects will now need either a Unity Pro license or a Preferred Platform License Key to develop for these platforms.\n  The news was delivered internally to Unity game developers on the Unity GameCore forum, and went into effect on June 30 th.\n  A Unity spokesperson confirmed to Gamasutra that the change took place, explaining that \u201cdeveloping for consoles is a complex undertaking for any studio and Unity has always recommended Unity Pro for development on these platforms.\u201d\n  The spokesperson also stressed that the change is for new developers working on new platform-approved projects that update to the 2021.2 tech stream. If your game is currently in development on an older version of Unity, you don\u2019t need Unity Pro at this time.\n  A handful of developers reached out to Gamasutra with concerns about this change because while Sony and Nintendo both make Preferred Platform License Keys available to developers, Microsoft does not. Previously if a developer had XDX (the Xbox Development SDK) on their computer, it apparently unlocked all Unity features for use on Xbox.\n  June\u2019s policy change renders that moot, and means a new developer working on an approved game for Xbox will need to pay for a Unity Pro license, which currently costs $1,800 per year per seat.\n  Unity previously required developers to use Unity Pro (or Enterprise) if their funding or revenue was greater than $200K\u00a0in the last 12 months. For smaller developers with less than $200K\u00a0in revenue or funding, Unity Plus and Unity Personal were options for development.\n  A spokesperson for Microsoft told Gamasutra that it the company is aware of the changes, but didn\u2019t indicate if the company would be creating its own Preferred Platform License Key program for developers. \u201cWe will continue to work with our development partners and engine providers, including Unity, to determine how to best support creators on Xbox,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n  They added that Microsoft is \u201cdeeply committed to independent developers and with our prioritization of the community accelerating, ensuring they have a clear path to success on Xbox and Windows.\u201d\n  Unity\u2019s changes here aren\u2019t exactly sweeping, since many developers working on the platform already pay for Unity Pro or have access to Preferred Platform License Keys. Some developers Gamasutra spoke with didn\u2019t even notice the change took place, or expressed indifference about how it would affect their future projects.\n  Those who are most impacted are developers whose projects aren\u2019t approved yet who are interested in shipping their game on Xbox or any other platform that doesn\u2019t provide the partnered license keys, and who don\u2019t quite have the cash for Unity Pro.\n  Developers reaching out to Gamasutra also expressed concern over the decision to announce this change by way of an internal forum that requires you to sign a non-disclosure agreement to access\u2014new developers most impacted by the policy change might not know about the shift in economics for publishing on these specific platforms.\n  It\u2019s\u00a0concern worth highlighting. Hopefully Microsoft is in the process of restoring the same level of access for Unity developers that was previously available with XDX.", "posttime": "2021-08-06 01:51:22", "source_domain":

Raft is famed for its understandability (relative to other consensus algorithms such as  Paxos) yet some aspects of the protocol still require careful treatment. For instance, determining when it is safe for a leader to commit commands from previous leaders or when it is safe for servers to delete or overwrite commands in their logs.\n Recently, byzantine agreement protocols, such as  Tendermint,  Casper FFG, and  HotStuff, have utilized the abstraction of chains to decide a sequence of commands. This is instead of the usual approach of a mutable replicated log, as used by protocols such as  Multi-Paxos, Raft &amp;  PBFT. Previously, we described a simple rotating leader consensus algorithm,  Benign HotStuff, using this chain-based approach.\n In today\u2019s post, we continue to examine chain-based approaches to consensus by describing the Raft protocol using chaining. We call the resulting protocol  Chained Raft and it gives us a new (and arguably simpler) lens through which to view Raft and the problem of consensus more generally. Importantly, the switch from mutable to immutable state can make Raft easier to reason about. Reads within the protocol never become stale and we avoid the tricky question of when it is safe to overwrite state.  We are by no means the first to use immutability to reduce the complexity of distributed systems.\n  The aim of Raft and Chained Raft is to implement  state machine replication. Specifically, a set of servers each maintain a copy of a state machine and the consensus protocol must ensure that each state machine receives the same sequence of commands.\n Both algorithms take the same high-level approach of electing one server to be the  leader. Clients send commands to the leader and the leader copies them onto a majority of servers using the AppendEntries RPC before committing them to its state machine and replying to the clients. When the leader fails, another server is elected to be the leader using the RequestVotes RPC. This process involves a majority of servers to ensure that the new leader has a copy of all commands executed by the previous leader.\n  Just like Raft, Chained Raft takes place over a series of  terms, each with at most one leader. Each server stores its current term, which is initially 0 and increases over time.\n A  block contains a command (in practice, a batch of commands) and a pointer to a previous block. A block in Chained Raft is analogous to a log entry in Raft. Note that unlike log entries in Raft, blocks in Chained Raft do not contain indexes or terms.\n Each server starts with an empty  genesis block and adds blocks over time to form a  chain. This chain is analogous to a log in Raft. Below is an example chain, it begins with the genesis block (shown in grey) which is followed by three blocks containing the commands A, B &amp; C (shown in blue).\n  New blocks are created by the current leader, which then appends these blocks to the chains of its  followers using the AppendEntries RPC. A leader can commit a command to its state machine only once it has ensured that all future leaders will do the same.\n Unlike Raft\u2019s logs, these chains are immutable thus servers never delete or overwrite blocks. The chains may fork into multiple branches (and even sub-branches) when recovering from a leader failure, however, only one branch will ever be committed. The chain below has forked into two branches so only one of D or E &amp; F could be committed.\n  The  head of a chain is the most recently added block (aka the  tip). This block will not be pointed to by any other block in the chain. In other words, the head is always one of the leaves of the \u201ctree\u201d. Initially, the head of each chain is the genesis block and the head is updated each time a block (or sequence of blocks) is added. The head is used by servers to track which of the chain branches is most up to date.\n Each server maintains a  commit marker. The commit marker points to the highest block (furthest from the genesis block) in the chain which can safely be committed to a state machine. This is analogous to the commit index in Raft. The commit marker is initially set to the genesis block and progresses along the chain over time.\n All blocks on the path from the genesis block to the commit marker can be safely committed. In the example below, only command A can be committed.\n  If there is a path from a block $b$ to a block $b\u2019$ then we say that block $b$  extends block $b\u2019$. All blocks therefore extend the genesis block.\n As well as the current term, each server also stores the  last appended term, which is the term the server was in when it last appended a block to its chain. To put it another way, this was the term when the current head was appended. The last appended term is initially 0 and increases over time. The last appended term is always equal to or less than the current term. The last appended term in Chained Raft serves the same function as the last log term in Raft.\n  A leader commits a command by first creating a new block containing the command and a pointer to its current head, the newly created block is added to the leader\u2019s chain and the head is updated to the new block. The leader then replicates this block to its followers using the  AppendEntries RPC (as in Raft). Note that the log entries in Raft\u2019s AppendEntries RPC are replaced by blocks. The previous log index and previous log term in Raft\u2019s AppendEntries RPC can be omitted as block pointers now serve the same purpose.\n After checking the term of the AppendEntries RPC, a follower will add the received blocks to its chain provided it already has the block which is pointed to by the first new block. Otherwise, the follower will reply with false and the leader will retry the AppendEntries RPC, this time with the previous block too. This process will continue until the follower successfully adds the new blocks.\n Whenever a follower adds new blocks to a chain, its head is updated accordingly. If this is the first time this follower has appended blocks in this term then it will also update the last appended term. The next index and match index used by leaders in Raft to track the state of the follower\u2019s logs is replaced with the analogous  next markers and  match markers. Once the leader learns that the majority of servers have appended a block, the commit marker can be updated. The updated commit marker is included in subsequent AppendEntries RPCs.\n The example below shows the chains of three servers. The first server is a leader which has added a new block (command C) but has not yet sent the AppendEntries RPC to its followers.\n Below shows the same example after the leader has completed the AppendEntries RPC with the followers. Both followers now have a copy of command C and the leader has updated its commit marker as a result. The followers have also learned that the previous block (command B) can be committed as the leader included its commit marker in the AppendEntries RPC.\n  Leader election in Chained Raft works much the same as it does in Raft. When a follower becomes a  candidate, it votes for itself and sends a  RequestVote RPC to all servers. Instead of including the last log term and last log index, the RequestVote RPC includes the candidate\u2019s head and last appended term.\n Like Raft, a follower votes for a candidate only if the follower has not already voted for another candidate in this term and the candidate\u2019s chain (or log) is at least as up to date as the follower\u2019s. A candidate\u2019s chain is at least as up to date, provided either:\n the candidate\u2019s last appended term is greater than the follower\u2019s last appended term or\n  the candidate\u2019s last appended term is equal to the follower\u2019s last appended term and either:\n Once a candidate receives votes from a majority of followers then it becomes a leader.\n The example below shows the state of three servers. Only the first and second servers could become leaders. The first server could receive votes from any server. The second server could receive a vote from the third server as it has a greater last appended term but it will not receive a vote from the first server. Neither the first or second server will vote for the third server.\n Consider what might happen next if the second server becomes the leader. The new leader will add the next block (command D) to its head (command B) and replicate it using the AppendEntries RPC. As shown below this would create a fork on the first server.\n A newly elected leader may have uncommitted blocks from the previous leaders. In this case, it replicates them to the followers using the AppendEntries RPC when it adds the first new block in the current term. As per usual in Raft, once this new block has been replicated onto a majority of servers, the leader can update its commit marker and thus commits the blocks from previous leaders as well. Notice that a leader will therefore always send AppendEntries RPCs containing at least one new block from its current term.\n  The chain on each server grows over time. In practice, once a commit marker passes a fork in the chain, the other branches can be safely garbage collected. These branches, which should be very rare, represent the \u201croads not taken\u201d by Chained Raft. These forks only occur when a leader fails and the new leader\u2019s chain does not contain all of the blocks added by the failed leader. It is important to note that these \u201cmissed blocks\u201d cannot have been committed by a previous leader before it failed.\n Consider the example below. Before the commit marker passes the fork, the chain includes two branches, command D and commands E/F. Later, once the commit marker has been updated to command E then the branch containing command D can be safely deleted.\n   The  Raft paper (Figure 3) identifies five properties which are useful for proving the safety of Raft. The analogous properties for Chained Raft are below:\n    In other words, leaders only move their heads forwards along a chain. Note that this is slightly different from Raft\u2019s leader append-only which states that \u201ca leader never overwrites or deletes entries in its log; it only appends new entries.\u201d. In Chained Raft, all servers only append new blocks.\n Log Matching property: If two chains contain the same block then the path from the genesis block to the block on both chains will be the same.\n This is achieved by the requirement that servers only append a new block if they already have the block pointed to by the new block.\n Leader Completeness: If a block is committed in a given term then the heads of the leaders for all greater terms will either be the block or will extend the block.\n Consider a block $b$ that was first committed by the leader in term $t$. At least a majority of servers will at some point have had last appended terms of $t$ and heads which were $b$ or which extended $b$.\n We will use a proof by induction over the terms after $t$ to show leader completeness.\n Base case Consider what happens in the next term, $t+1$. If there is a leader in term $t+1$ then it received votes from a majority of servers. At least one server with a last appended term of $t$ and a head which is also either $b$ or extends $b$ must have voted for the leader. Since the leader cannot have a last appended term greater than $t$, the leader must have had the same last appended term ($t$) and a head which is equal to the server\u2019s head or extends it. Therefore, if term $t+1$ had a leader then $b$ will be present in the path from the genesis block to the leader\u2019s head.\n Inductive case Consider what happens in some term $t+k$. We assume that leader completeness holds up to term $t+k-1$. If there is a leader in term $t+k$ then it received votes from a majority of servers. At least one server which once had a last appended term $t$ and a head which is also either $b$ or extends $b$ must vote for the leader. Any leaders since will have added blocks that extend $b$. Therefore if the term $t+k$ has a leader then the leader\u2019s head will be $b$ or extend it.\n State Machine Safety: Each copy of the replicated state machine receives the same commands in the same order.\n Combining the previous properties and the fact that servers only commit commands when they are instructed to do so by the leader, gives us state machine safety.\n  Like Raft, Chained Raft guarantees liveness  after synchrony provided at least a majority of servers are up and communicating reliably  (caveats apply).\n The proof of liveness which we will skip for now is much the same for Raft and Chained Raft, however, the following idea is useful to note. From the leader append-only property we know that if two servers have the same last appended term then their heads are either the same or one head extends the other. This means that for any pair of servers at least one server could vote for the other and thus at least one server in any majority could be elected leader.\n   Benign HotStuff is a rotating leader protocol, where each leader (aka a  primary in Benign HotStuff) adds one block before handing over leadership to the next server. In contrast, Chained Raft is a stable leader protocol, where a leader adds blocks until it fails (or at least until another server believes it has failed).\n In benign HotStuff, the role of leader is rotated between servers in a round-robin fashion, whereas in Raft and Chained Raft, servers must gain votes from a majority of servers before becoming a leader.\n Benign Hotstuff takes the  \u201cRaft-style\u201d approach to consensus of assigning terms to blocks for their lifetime and thus blocks are not \u201cpromoted\u201d to greater terms by subsequent leaders, as is the case with \u201cPaxos-style\u201d consensus. Chained Raft avoids the question of what term to assign to blocks from previous terms by storing only the term of the head (using the last appended term).\n Like Benign HotStuff, Chained Raft requires the leader to copy uncommitted blocks (called  state transfer in Benign Hotstuff) to its followers alongside adding a new block in the current term. This restriction helps to simplify both algorithms as it means that the most recently added block, the head, is always from the latest leader.\n Note that the propose message in Benign HotStuff is analogous to the AppendEntries RPC request in Chained Raft and the vote message in Benign HotStuff is analogous to a combined AppendEntries RPC response and RequestVote RPC response.\n Benign HotStuff stores a term with every block whereas Chained Raft only tracks the term of the current head (using the last appended term).\n  We have described Raft using append-only chains instead of mutable logs. Interestingly, Chained Raft and Raft are very similar protocols. Raft can be expressed naturally using chains as it already decides commands strictly in-order (unlike some other consensus protocols such as  Multi-Paxos).\n So, what do you think? Is Chained Raft simpler than the original Raft protocol? Would you be interested in seeing other log-based consensus algorithms such as  Multi-Paxos or  Fast Paxos described using chains?

"note_en": "The federal government has banned Australians who normally live in other countries from returning home without needing government permission in a move branded as \u201cbarbaric.\u201d\n Until now, residents of other countries who are Australian are allowed to leave the country without applying for an exemption, but are regularly questioned at the border and required to prove that they live abroad as part of the international border bans brought in at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n  But on Thursday the government quietly changed the rule, effective from August 11, claiming it was a loophole.\n Now, according to the government\u2019s  explanatory statement tabled in Parliament, a person will have to demonstrate to the Australian Border Force Commissioner a \u201ccompelling reason for needing to leave Australian territory\u201d.\n  The amendment, which cannot be disallowed, \u201cwill reduce the pressure on Australia\u2019s quarantine capacity, reduce the risks posed to the Australian population from COVID-19, and assist in returning vulnerable Australians back home,\u201d the government said.\n Exemptions can be granted for business travel, but the government has previously said it intends to clamp down on the number of them being granted.\n The government did not issue a press release to alert the public to the change nor did Health Minister Greg Hunt, who tabled the amendment, raise it in any of his media interviews on Thursday.\n  \u201cThis does not stop Australians ordinarily resident outside Australia from departing. However, these people will now need to apply for an exemption,\u201d she said.\n  \u201cThe exemption\u2019s regime is based on health advice and enables people to travel if essential, but is ultimately about keeping Australians safe from overseas COVID transmission.\u201d\n  James Turbitt recently flew back to Australia from Belgium to try and say goodbye to his seriously ill mother.\n He missed out on seeing her one last time because he was told to hire a charter flight worth tens of thousands of dollars to qualify for an exemption to leave hotel quarantine. He is currently in the country sorting out her affairs before returning home.\n Turbitt said the government\u2019s changes were aimed at citizens like him and that it was \u201cbarbaric and counterproductive\u201d.\n  \u201cI came back for the passing of my mother, I was locked in a hotel room while she passed away, denied an exemption to see her, and now I am subjected to proving my life overseas, in order to leave again?\u201d the 35-year-old said.\n \u201cMy life is overseas, my work is there, my partner is there, I\u2019ve just lost my mother, and now I can be denied to go back and seek comfort from my partner?\n \u201cShe has not been allowed in with me and now I might be denied leaving? What has this country come to?\n \u201cThe [Queensland] Premier goes overseas to the Olympics, the Prime Minister goes to check out his family history in England.\n  \u201cNow someone who doesn\u2019t even want to be in this country is potentially going to be forcibly detained in a place he doesn\u2019t want to be. I do not agree that it is fair,\u201d he said.\n Australia is alone in banning its citizens, temporary visa holders, permanent residents and dual citizens from leaving the country under the international travel ban brought in March 2020.\n It is also the only country to have  temporarily threatened some of its citizens with the threat of jail and massive fines if they tried to return home from India during the height of its recent COVID wave. Several Australians who had been trying to get home died in India.\n Australia is also alone in the world in locking out its citizens through a cap on the number of people who can enter the country in a single week \u2013 recently halved to around 3000 at the request of several Labor premiers.\n This has resulted in a queue of more than 35,000 Australians around the world who are trying to get home at any one time but can\u2019t because of the restrictions on hotel quarantine spaces.\n The Morning Edition newsletter is our guide to the day\u2019s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.

Yelp for Business \u5e10\u6237\u9875\u9762\u4e0a\u627e\u5230\u3002", "note_en": "While there is no federal mandate for businesses to require proof of vaccination, some cities are introducing their own policies. Recently, New York City became the first to  require proof of vaccination for indoor restaurants and gyms, and, San Francisco is  now exploring a similar set of mandates. Other cities may choose to follow suit in the future.\n In addition,  local  business  owners across the U.S. are implementing their own measures outside of federal or state guidance, including requiring masks or proof of vaccination for customers, or requiring their staff to be vaccinated. These choices often come at price, as the businesses risk social media backlash and bad reviews from the anti-vaccine crowd.\n Yelp\u2019s new features will represent an attempt to help mitigate that reaction, the company explains.\n  Yelp says it will proactively leverage a combination of automated systems and human moderators to safeguard businesses from attacks from customers if a business opts to activate either of the two new options related to their Covid vaccine policies.\n Though the company has long since had  systems in place to address \u201creview bombing\u201d incidents, Yelp says the practice has gotten worse in recent months.\n  In the past, businesses that gained negative public attention may have had an influx of reviews from those who didn\u2019t have a first-hand experience with the business in question, which violates Yelp\u2019s policy. Yelp may then alert visitor to the business\u2019s page that there\u2019s the potential for fake reviews or that thee had been spikes in unusual activity. The company will sometimes even temporarily block users from being able to leave reviews. And in some cases, Yelp will also need to  remove false reviews or those that otherwise violate its policies.\n But since January 2021, Yelp says it\u2019s had to place over 100  Unusual Activity Alerts on its pages in response to a business gaining public attention for their Covid health and safety practices. This has included if a business notified customers that vaccinations were required for its employees or for its patrons.\n As a result, Yelp has had to remove nearly 4,500 reviews for violating its content guidelines.\n  As Yelp was already handling these types of incidents, it\u2019s now more formally introducing a way for businesses to flag their Covid policies through the new products.\n The company notes it put a similar system in place when it launched our  Black-owned attribute in June 2020 and again followed the same process for other identity attributes (e.g.  Latinx-owned,  Asian-owned, and  LGBTQ-owned) by proactively monitoring business pages that activated these attributes for any hateful, racist or other harmful content that violated its content guidelines.\n The company tells TechCrunch there was demand for its new Covid policy feature from business owners, as well.\n  \u201cBoth business owners and consumers have expressed interest in Yelp releasing vaccine-related attributes,\u201d said Noorie Malik, Yelp\u2019s VP of User Operations. \u201cFor many months we\u2019ve seen businesses implement vaccine requirements for both their customers and staff. As a result, we\u2019ve also seen a rise in reviews focused on people\u2019s stance on Covid vaccinations rather than their actual experience with the business,\u201d Malik noted.\n The businesses want to be assured that their page will be more actively monitored for false reviews when they choose to share this information.\n Yelp, of course, understands that if allowed its reviews platform to become a place that veered away from customers detailing their first-hand experiences, it service overall would become less useful.\n \u201cYelp has always served as a trusted source of information on local businesses, helping the millions of people that come to Yelp every day make informed spending decisions,\u201d Malik said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that consumers have a resource for relevant first-hand information when engaging with a business. You could argue this is even more important during a public health crisis, making reviews from relevant first-hand consumer experiences critical.\u201d\n The feature is rolling out now and can be found on the  Yelp for Business account page.", "posttime": "2021-08-06 01:06:29", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6dfb\u52a0,adds,\u4f01\u4e1a", "title": "Yelp \u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8ba9\u4f01\u4e1a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5206\u4eab\u4e0e\u75ab\u82d7\u76f8\u5173\u7684 Covid \u653f\u7b56", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tYelp adds tools that let businesses share their Covid policies related to vaccines\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/yelp-adds-tools-that-let-businesses-share-their-covid-policies-related-to-vaccines/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6dfb\u52a0", "adds", "\u4f01\u4e1a"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "60045bfb6bb4930751583e2def80e90f.jpeg", "infoid": 1071570, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u5bb6\u82af\u7247\u5236\u9020\u5546\u5728\u4e00\u4efd\u58f0\u660e\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9ad8\u901a\u4ee5\u6bcf\u80a1 37 \u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u51fa\u4ef7 46 \u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u83b7\u5f97\u516c\u53f8\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u7684\u6279\u51c6\uff0c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u80a1\u4e1c\u200b\u200b\u6295\u7968\u3002 Veoneer \u548c Magna \u5728 7 \u6708\u4efd\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e24\u5bb6\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u90fd\u6279\u51c6\u4e86\u6b64\u6b21\u6536\u8d2d\u3002 Veoneer \u662f\u9ad8\u7ea7\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u8f66\u8f86\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u5546\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6267\u884c\u4e00\u7ec4\u6709\u9650\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u4e0a\u53d8\u6362\u8f66\u9053\u6216\u7d27\u6025\u5236\u52a8\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1 ADAS \u4e0e\u201c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u201d\u76f8\u53bb\u751a\u8fdc\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u4e14\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u529f\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u5f53\u4eca\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u66f4\u591a\u65b0\u8f66\u4e2d\u3002\u9ea6\u683c\u7eb3\u548c\u9ad8\u901a\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fc5\u901f\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u7ade\u8d2d\u6218\u770b\u597d ADAS \u6280\u672f\u7684\u672a\u6765\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6bcf\u5bb6\u516c\u53f8\u90fd\u5e0c\u671b\u4e0e\u4e00\u7ea7 ADAS \u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u5927\u9646\u548c\u535a\u4e16\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002\u9ad8\u901a\u7684\u5e02\u503c\u76ee\u524d\u4e3a 1648 \u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u800c\u9ea6\u683c\u7eb3\u7684\u5e02\u503c\u4e3a 253 \u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u9ea6\u683c\u7eb3\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u63d0\u4ea4\u53cd\u6295\u6807\u3002\u5e02\u573a\u5bf9\u65b0\u51fa\u4ef7\u505a\u51fa\u4e86\u56de\u5e94\uff0cVeoneer \u7684\u80a1\u4ef7\u5728\u5468\u4e09\u548c\u5468\u56db\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e0a\u6da8\u4e86\u8fd1 7 \u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4ece 31.22 \u7f8e\u5143\u4e0a\u6da8\u81f3 38.20 \u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u5728 7 \u6708 23 \u65e5\u5ba3\u5e03\u51fa\u552e\u7ed9 Magna \u4e4b\u524d\uff0cVeoneer \u7684\u80a1\u4ef7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u80a1 19.93 \u7f8e\u5143\u3002 Veoneer \u4e8e 2018 \u5e74\u4ece\u6c7d\u8f66\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u5236\u9020\u5546 Autoliv \u5206\u62c6\u51fa\u6765\u3002 \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4e0e\u6c83\u5c14\u6c83\u6c7d\u8f66\u6210\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u5bb6\u540d\u4e3a Zenuity \u7684\u5408\u8d44\u4f01\u4e1a\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u8be5\u5408\u8d44\u4f01\u4e1a\u540e\u6765\u4e8e\u53bb\u5e74 7 \u6708\u5206\u62c6\u3002 ADAS \u5f00\u53d1\u5546\u8fd8\u4e0e\u9ad8\u901a\u516c\u53f8\u6709\u9884\u5148\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u4e24\u5bb6\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u4e00\u6708\u4efd\u7b7e\u7f72\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5728 ADAS \u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "note_en": "Qualcomm\u2019s $4.6 billion bid, which comes in at $37 per share, has already received approval from the company\u2019s board and would not need a stockholder vote, the chipmaker said in a statement. Veoneer and Magna said in July that both companies\u2019 boards had approved the acquisition.\n Veoneer is a developer of advanced driver assistance systems, decision-making vehicle hardware and software that can perform a limited set of actions under certain conditions, like changing lanes on a highway or emergency braking. While ADAS is a far cry from \u201cself-driving cars,\u201d it has become a popular \u2014 and attainable \u2014 set of features that are appearing in a greater share of new vehicles on offer today.\n The burgeoning bidding war between Magna and Qualcomm is bullish on the future of ADAS technology, as each company seeks to stay competitive with Tier-1 ADAS suppliers Continental and Bosch. Qualcomm\u2019s market capitalization currently sits at $164.8 billion, while Magna\u2019s is $25.3 billion. It\u2019s unclear whether Magna will submit a counter-bid.\n The market has responded to the new bid, with the stock price of Veoneer rising nearly $7 per share, from $31.22 to $38.20 between Wednesday and Thursday. Prior to the announcement of the sale to Magna on July 23, Veoneer stock sat at $19.93 per share.\n Veoneer was spun off from automotive safety system maker Autoliv in 2018.

Mission managers held open the option of making another attempt Wednesday at 12:57 p.m. ET, weather permitting, if the problem can be resolved in time.\n The launching atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket initially was planned for last Friday, but NASA ordered a delay while Russian space station engineers   resolved problems with a newly arrived laboratory module. Over the weekend, the Starliner launch was reset for Tuesday.\n Forecasters monitoring Florida&#39;s typically stormy summer afternoon weather predicted a 60% chance of acceptable conditions then lowered the odds to 50-50. The team pressed ahead with fueling, but around 10:30 a.m., Boeing announced the launch had been called off,  tweeting, &#34;We&#39;re confirming today&#39;s #Starliner Orbital Flight Test-2 launch is scrubbed. More details soon.&#34;\n The Starliner flight marks a major milestone for Boeing and NASA as the agency transitions from hitching rides aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft to fielding commercial crew ships built by Boeing and SpaceX.\n SpaceX, under a $2.6 billion NASA contract, launched its Crew Dragon spacecraft on a successful unpiloted test flight in 2019 and a piloted test flight last year. Since then, the California rocket builder has launched two operational flights to the space station carrying two long-duration crews to the outpost.\n Boeing, under a $4.2 billion contract, launched its Starliner on an unpiloted test flight December 20, 2019, but plans to dock with the space station were   derailed by software problems. Company managers are counting on this week&#39;s second test flight to finally clear the way for piloted missions.\n Depending on lessons learned, Boeing and NASA could be ready to launch three astronauts aboard a different Starliner capsule by the end of this year or early next year.", "posttime": "2021-08-06 00:52:07", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "starliner,scrubs,\u53d1\u5c04", "title": "\u6ce2\u97f3\u516c\u53f8\u5c06 Starliner \u4e58\u5458\u8231\u53d1\u5c04\u5230\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ad9", "title_en": "Boeing Scrubs Launch of Starliner Crew Capsule To Space Station", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/starliner-launch-nasa-boeing-watch-live-stream-today-2021-08-03/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["starliner", "scrubs", "\u53d1\u5c04"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "00d5af5b8027c5b9da78a41db8782e06.jpg", "infoid": 1071567, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5fae\u8f6f\u5df2\u901a\u77e5\u5458\u5de5\uff0c\u4ece 9 \u6708\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u8fdb\u5165\u7f8e\u56fd\u5fae\u8f6f\u5927\u697c\u7684\u4eba\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u4f9b\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u8bc1\u660e\u3002\u56e0\u8eab\u4f53\u72b6\u51b5\u6216\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u539f\u56e0\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u5b97\u6559\u4fe1\u4ef0\uff09\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63a5\u79cd\u75ab\u82d7\u7684\u5458\u5de5\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u7279\u6b8a\u4f4f\u5bbf\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8fd8\u5c06\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u7684\u5168\u9762\u91cd\u65b0\u5f00\u653e\u65e5\u671f\u4ece 9 \u6708\u63a8\u8fdf\u5230\u201c\u4e0d\u65e9\u4e8e 2021 \u5e74 10 \u6708 4 \u65e5\u201d\u3002\u6b63\u5982\u6211\u4eec\u81ea\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u5f00\u59cb\u4ee5\u6765\u6240\u505a\u7684\u90a3\u6837\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u7ee7\u7eed\u5bc6\u5207\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b0\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5e76\u968f\u7740\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u8c03\u6574\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u5c06\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u653e\u5728\u9996\u4f4d\u3002\u6839\u636e\u6211\u4eec\u4e0e\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u534f\u5546\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u5168\u9762\u5f00\u653e\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u7684\u6700\u65e9\u65e5\u671f\u4e0d\u65e9\u4e8e 2021 \u5e74 10 \u6708 4 \u65e5\u3002\u4ece 9 \u6708\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u5c06\u8981\u6c42\u6240\u6709\u5458\u5de5\u3001\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4efb\u4f55\u8fdb\u5165\u7f8e\u56fd Microsoft \u5927\u697c\u7684\u5ba2\u4eba\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u4e3a\u5458\u5de5\u5236\u5b9a\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u4f4f\u5bbf\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u7ee7\u7eed\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5730\u533a/\u56fd\u5bb6/\u5dde\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5ba1\u67e5\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6839\u636e\u9700\u8981\u8c03\u6574\u65e5\u671f\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u3002\u5fae\u8f6f\u544a\u8bc9 The Verge\uff0c\u90a3\u4e9b\u7167\u987e\u514d\u75ab\u6291\u5236\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4eba\u5458\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u662f\u5b69\u5b50\u592a\u5c0f\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63a5\u79cd\u75ab\u82d7\u7684\u7236\u6bcd\uff0c\u5c06\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5bb6\u5de5\u4f5c\u5230 1 \u6708\u4efd\u3002\u5fae\u8f6f\u7684\u516c\u544a\u662f\u5728\u5168\u56fd\u8303\u56f4\u5185 COVID-19 \u6848\u4ef6\u6fc0\u589e\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8\u5b9e\u65bd\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u4e4b\u540e\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u3002 Facebook \u8981\u6c42\u6240\u6709\u7f8e\u56fd\u5458\u5de5\u5728\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u6234\u53e3\u7f69\uff0c\u5e76\u8981\u6c42\u6240\u6709\u5458\u5de5\u5728\u8fd4\u56de\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u65f6\u63a5\u79cd COVID-19 \u75ab\u82d7\u3002 Facebook \u9884\u8ba1\u5c06\u5728 10 \u6708\u5168\u9762\u91cd\u65b0\u5f00\u653e\u3002\u8c37\u6b4c\u8fd8\u5c06\u8981\u6c42\u5458\u5de5\u5728\u8fd4\u56de\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u4e4b\u524d\u63a5\u79cd\u75ab\u82d7\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd4\u56de\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u8fdf\u5230 10 \u6708 18 \u65e5\u3002", "note_en": "Microsoft has informed employees that it will require proof of vaccination for anyone entering a Microsoft building in the US starting in September.

intelligence models to help place thousands of 5G wireless transmitters for optimal performance.\n  Later this year, the company will begin a multibillion-dollar rollout of midband spectrum, which expands coverage of its existing ultra wideband 5G wireless service.\n  Maximizing coverage with the least number of transmitters is a priority, said Shankar Arumugavelu, senior vice president and global chief information officer of Verizon.\n  \u201cWhen we build out these networks, these are very capital-intensive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to make sure that we are being very judicious in terms of how we are investing our capital.\u201d\n    The models, designed by in-house data scientists and other employees, factor in a number of variables that can alter the strength of 5G signals, like buildings, bridges, terrain, the position of the transmitter, as well as other transmitters nearby.\n    Verizon, along with rivals  AT&amp;T  and T-Mobile US Inc., is racing to build out nationwide 5G service,  a yearslong effort slowed by the lack of available airwaves for fast transmission and long signal ranges, and by the deployment of new network equipment, analysts have said.\n  The largest U.S. carrier, Verizon began using AI models in 2018 to determine the best spots to install transmitters for its ultra wideband spectrum and is using AI again for its midband spectrum, considered the sweet spot in terms of range and speed. Verizon expects to cover 100 million people with midband spectrum by March 2022, according to the company.\n  \u201cWithout AI, we would not be able to do this. Period,\u201d Mr. Arumugavelu said.\n  In a U.S. government airwaves auction earlier this year, Verizon  landed more than half of the midband spectrum.\n  The carrier will pay  more than $50 billion for those airwaves and related expenses and is planning a total of $10 billion in capital expenditures over the next three years to expand its midband range, the WSJ has previously reported.\n      T-Mobile, which is also bringing out its midband 5G network, has used AI models to help engineers prioritize the locations for upgrading its 4G gear to 5G, said Grant Castle, vice president of device engineering and technology labs.\n  So-called small cell 5G transmitters, or antennas, are about the size of a backpack and are placed on vertical structures like utility poles or buildings.\n  Verizon\u2019s AI system can point to the best such perches by weighing various factors within specific ZIP Codes and how well the signal could cover the area, Mr. Arumugavelu said. Using computer-vision technology, the models can analyze spatial and geographic elements\u2014bridges, trees and building heights around specific intersections, for instance\u2014and find the most viable spot for a 5G transmitter, he added.\n  The technology can also recommend the best positioning for the antennas so that the signal covers the area without causing interference with other antennas nearby, he said.\n  Billions of dollars are at stake in the rollout of midband 5G spectrum, which is why Verizon is relying on AI, said Sid Nag, vice president of research for cloud and edge computing at technology research firm  Gartner\n  \u201cThey have to be very precise and clinical to identify the places where they are going to place the nodes,\u201d he said.\n  Businesses are expected to adopt 5G faster than consumers, partly because of the technology\u2019s potential to enable connectivity for drones, autonomous vehicles and remote healthcare, Mr. Nag said.\n  Verizon and other carriers are also focused on making sure the 5G nodes are in just the right spots because they want their customers to be as satisfied as possible with the service, he said.\n      Deloitte

solutions, has  raised $56 million in series B funding led by Crosspoint Capital Partners with participation from ForgePoint Capital and Prelude. Cofounder and CEO Mario Vuksan says the proceeds, which bring its total raised to $81 million, will be put toward scaling ReversingLabs\u2019 sales and marketing efforts as ReversingLabs looks to expand its global reach.\n Over the past year, there\u2019s been several high-profile incidents where attackers have attempted to compromise enterprises through the software supply chain. According to a recent Anchore  survey, 64% of companies were affected by.a supply chain attack in 2021 and 60% have made securing the software supply chain a top 2022 priority. The attacks highlight the need for controls that can help validate the integrity of software and its components through the development, deployment, and adoption lifecycle.\n  ReversingLabs, which was founded in 2009 by Mario Vuksan and Tomislav Pericin, aims to combat the growing threat with static analysis and file reputation services that provide visibility into malware and its location. The platform analyzes file and binary-based threats emerging from the web, mobile, email, cloud, and app development across industry verticals like software, financial services, defense, retail, and insurance.\n \u201cThe level of sophistication and complexity in today\u2019s cybersecurity attacks means that enterprises can no longer assume that software products from their providers are safe,\u201d CrossPoint managing partner Dr. Hugh Thompson said in a press release. \u201cReversingLabs provides a proactive and transparent approach to understanding the threats that exist within software even in cases where you don\u2019t have access to source code.\u201d\n  At the core of the ReversingLabs platform is the \u201cTitanium\u201d engine, an  AI system that harvests thousands of file types and continuously monitors an index of over 10 billion files for future threats. The system unpacks files in the underlying object structure \u2014 down to embedded executables, libraries, documents, resources, and icons \u2014 and maps \u201chuman-readable\u201d indicators to classifications. Security analysts get threat intelligence that they can us to prioritize threats, while threat intelligence and hunting teams get a workbench for deep file analysis, ostensibly enabling them to accelerate investigations.\n \u201cEvery organization, whether an integrated software vendor developing software or an enterprise procuring or using software, needs controls to manage the software supply chain attack surface,\u201d Crosspoint managing partner Greg Clark said in a statement. \u201cThis attack surface is nuanced, and traditional approaches like source code scanning are insufficient. Every part of the code, compile, build and deploy cycle needs to be checked. ReversingLabs is a great ally in the fight against these threats. Their solution is unique, very hard to replicate and immensely valuable.\u201d\n ReversingLabs competes in a cybersecurity market anticipated to be worth $170.4 billion in 2022,  according to Gartner.

Previously, Amazon had expected employees to start working in the office regularly the week of Sept. 7.\n However, Amazon stopped short of implementing a vaccine mandate for those who do work in the office, as companies including Microsoft, Google, and Facebook have done. Amazon said it requires employees to wear masks in the office, except for those who can verify they\u2019ve been fully vaccinated.\n  Amazon informed employees of the new timeline in a message this morning, and confirmed the details in a statement to GeekWire.\n Its decision ups the ante for corporate responses to the rise of the COVID-19 Delta variant. Microsoft earlier this week said the full reopening of its U.S. workplaces  will now take place no earlier than Oct. 4. Google and Apple currently have similar timelines.\n The role of Amazon and other tech giants as bellwethers for such decisions means that other companies often follow their lead.\n Amazon\u2019s guidance for returning to work has evolved in response to changing public health guidelines and employee feedback.\u00a0 The company  said in March that it planned to \u201creturn to an office-centric culture as our baseline.\u201d\n  It  relaxed that stance in June, saying it would offer \u201ca mix of working between the office and home,\u201d with a baseline of three days a week in the office.\n The seven-day rolling daily average of COVID-19 cases has more than quadrupled in Washington state in the past month,  to more than 1,500 daily cases as of Aug. 1.

"note_en": "Consuming alcohol increases the risk of getting more cancers than previously thought, according to a major study, which also found that drinking coffee protects against liver cancer.\n Alcohol consumption is linked to several cancers including those of the head and neck \u2013 mouth, pharynx and larynx \u2013 oesophageal and bowel, along with the more widely known connection with breast and liver cancer, according to an international team led by  Imperial College London.\n  The study also showed that drinking at least one cup of coffee daily is associated with a lower risk of developing liver cancer and  basal cell carcinoma of the skin, with the effects observed for both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee.\n   Giota Mitrou, the director of research and innovation at World  Cancer Research Fund (WCRF), which funded the research, said: \u201cThis umbrella review confirms the evidence we have for alcohol and coffee in relation to cancer.\n \u201cFurther research needs to better understand the mechanisms involved in the links between coffee and cancer as well as between alcohol and different cancer subtypes.\u201d\n She said people who were concerned about how their diet might affect their risk of cancer could consult the WCRF\u2019s  cancer prevention recommendations, which advocate limiting alcohol consumption, being a healthy weight and physically active, and enjoying a diet rich in wholegrains, vegetables, fruit and pulses.\n Alcohol increases the risk of cancer because when it is metabolised, it breaks down into chemicals that can bind to DNA, resulting in mutations that could become cancerous.\n Alcohol can also increase the levels of the hormones linked to the development of some types of breast cancer. In general, the more alcoholic drinks a person consumes, the higher their risk of developing one of the associated cancers, the scientists found.\n The authors of the study are calling for more targeted public health policies that enable people to understand the  link between drinking alcohol and cancer to encourage them to limit their consumption.\n Coffee, conversely, is thought to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may protect against diseases triggered by inflammation such as cancer.\n The Imperial study looked at data from 860 reviews of published studies, which explored the association between food and nutrient intake and the risk of either developing or dying from 11 different cancers.\n Although the researchers found weak links between cancer and most types of food and drink, the evidence for increased risk from alcohol consumption and reduced risk for coffee and dairy products was strong for the 11 cancers they looked at.", "posttime":

software. Today, I\u2019d like to tell you a bitabout  PostgreSQL.\n Many people don\u2019t understand how old Postgres truly is: the first release  1was in July of 1996. It used this logo:\n  After 25 years of persistence, and a better logo design, Postgres stands todayas one of the most significant pillars of profound achievement in free software,alongside the likes of Linux and Firefox. PostgreSQL has taken a complex problemand  solved it to such an effective degree that all of its competitors areessentially obsolete, perhaps with the exception of SQLite.\n For a start, Postgres is simply an incredibly powerful, robust, and reliablepiece of software, providing the best implementation of SQL.  2It provides a great deal of insight into its own behavior, and allowsthe experienced operator to fine-tune it to achieve optimal performance. Itsupports a broad set of SQL features and data types, with which I have alwaysbeen able to efficiently store and retrieve my data. SQL is usually the #1bottleneck in web applications, and Postgres does an excellent job of providingyou with the tools necessary to manage that bottleneck.\n Those tools are also exceptionally well-documented. The  PostgreSQLdocumentation is  incredibly in-depth. It puts the rest of us to shame,really. Not only do they have comprehensive reference documentation whichexhaustively describes every feature, but also vast amounts of prose whichexplains the internal design, architecture, and operation of Postgres, plusdetailed plain-English explanations of how various high-level tasks can beaccomplished, complete with the necessary background to  understand thosetasks. There\u2019s essentially no reason to ever read a blog post or Stack Overflowanswer about how to do something with Postgres \u2014 the official docs coverevery aspect of the system in great depth.\n The project is maintained by a highly disciplined team of engineers. I havecomplete confidence in their abilities to handle matters of performance,regression testing, and security. They publish meticulously detailed weeklydevelopment updates, as well as thorough release notes that equips you withsufficient knowledge to confidently run updates on your deployment. Their gitdiscipline is also legendary \u2014 here\u2019s the  latest commit at the timeof writing:\n postgres_fdw: Fix issues with generated columns in foreign tables.postgres_fdw imported generated columns from the remote tables as plaincolumns, and caused failures like &#34;ERROR: cannot insert a non-DEFAULTvalue into column &#34;foo&#34;&#34; when inserting into the foreign tables, as ittried to insert values into the generated columns. To fix, we do thefollowing under the assumption that generated columns in a postgres_fdwforeign table are defined so that they represent generated columns inthe underlying remote table:* Send DEFAULT for the generated columns to the foreign server on insert or update, not generated column values computed on the local server.* Add to postgresImportForeignSchema() an option &#34;import_generated&#34; to include column generated expressions in the definitions of foreign tables imported from a foreign server. The option is true by default.The assumption seems reasonable, because that would make a query of thepostgres_fdw foreign table return values for the generated columns thatare consistent with the generated expression.While here, fix another issue in postgresImportForeignSchema(): it triedto include column generated expressions as column default expressions inthe foreign table definitions when the import_default option was enabled.Per bug #16631 from Daniel Cherniy. Back-patch to v12 where generatedcolumns were added.Discussion: https://postgr.es/m/16631-e929fe9db0ffc7cf%40postgresql.org\n  Ultimately, PostgreSQL is a technically complex program which requires anexperienced and skilled operator to be effective. Learning to use it is a costlyinvestment, even if it pays handsomely. Though Postgres has occasionallyfrustrated or confused me, on the whole my feelings for it are overwhelminglypositive. It\u2019s an incredibly well-made product and its enormous andstill-growing successes are very well-earned. When I think of projects whichhave made the most significant impacts on the free software ecosystem, and onthe world at large, PostgreSQL has a place on that list.", "posttime": "2021-08-06 00:49:14",

"note_en": "It has never been very clear to me why a book requires a foreword. If the reason is that the body of the book is not self-explanatory, then the need for a foreword does not speak very well for the body of the book. And if the reason is that the book requires some sort of endorsement, then the foreword should, really, be written by a book salesman, i.e., an  obviously interested party. (Nobody is ever fooled by ostensibly \u201cdisinterested parties\u201d anyway.)\n I am not really in a position to write a traditional foreword to Paolo Soleri\u2019s book: first, because I am not sure I understand it\u2014and so I cannot possibly interpret it with authority. (I am awed by it.) And, second, because I am not a disinterested party; I am his friend.\n  Who is Soleri? Answer: He is a wiry, medium-height man around fifty who was born in Torino, in Northern Italy, where he received his Doctorate in Architecture. After World War II, he came to the United States and became apprenticed to Frank Lloyd Wright. He was one of Wright\u2019s two or three most brilliant students and was therefore kicked out by the master. Since that time, more or less, he has lived and worked in Scottsdale, Arizona, writing, drawing (on endless sheets of butcher paper), and building\u2014both on his own acres in Scottsdale and elsewhere in the United States and Europe. He supports himself and his family by making ceramic and metal bells that swing in the breeze and make nice sounds.\n What is he trying to say? Answer: I am not completely sure, because this is a very difficult book to read. Like many so-called visionary types, Soleri has invented his own language, and some of the words in that language won\u2019t be found in any English dictionary. (Curiously enough, some of those words are a bit reminiscent of Italian Futurist talk of fifty years ago.)  What I  think he is trying to say is this: there is an inherent logic in the structure and nature of organisms that have grown on this planet. Any architecture, any urban design, and any social order that violates that structure and nature is destructive of itself and of us. Any architecture, urban design, or social order that is based upon organic principles is valid and will prove its own validity.\n What is he trying to draw? Answer: A new world based upon those principles. And beautifully, too! What is more, it seems as if the first settlement of this new world may soon be rising on 4,000 acres some 70 miles from Phoenix, Arizona, on a lovely plateau 3,700 feet above sea level. Here, Soleri and his students\u2014eventually as many as 2,000 people in all\u2014will soon build  Arcosanti, a community based upon the principles developed in this book. It will be, in Soleri\u2019s words,  a self-testing school for urban studies, a place where teaching and living will go on in an environment that is, in fact, the lesson itself. It is a daring project, and it will require financial support; but it is, to the best of my knowledge, the only  New Town currently planned in the United States that started with a visionary idea of real force\u2014rather than a mortgage.\n Is he practical or is he crazy? Answer: In view of what has been happening on this planet in recent years, it is safe to say that those in charge are neither practical nor sane. This does not mean, of course, that any  visionary profoundly critical of the present order of things is necessarily more practical or more sane. All it does mean is that anyone committed to the present way of building buildings, cities, or societies should disqualify himself as a critic of Soleri\u2019s proposals. In one of his more lucid statements, Soleri says that  the care of the citizen is the sap of the city. But one can care only for that which one loves. A lovable city is the key to a living city. A lovely city is not an accident, as a lovely person is not an accident. I rather doubt that the New York City Planning Commission, say, is likely to make LOVE its master plan; but if it were to do just that, who is to say that LOVE is not a more practical and a more sane policy than whatever that Commission is following at present?\n Why should anyone read Soleri\u2019s book? Answer: because that is the best way to gain access to some very remarkable ideas\u2014ideas that will challenge just about everything all the rest of us keep doing, day after day. Soleri says that  the fundamental distinction between the city and the anthill will be  not just brains by the score but also minds by the score. This book is the work of an extraordinary mind. I keep thinking of  Antonio Sant\u2019Elia, who\u2014to the best of my knowledge\u2014never built anything at all, but whose drawings of  ideal cities have profoundly shaped every modern city in the world.\n In any event, I have not seen a book on architecture and urban design, recently, that has bothered me as much as this one. If that is an improper foreword, so be it.\n   The written content of this book is really an  endogenous affair for and with myself. In both knowledge and information my credentials are very limited, but it must be recognized that the conceptual criteria for the arcologies are the necessary stuff of their makeup. If I were to present the arcologies without their theoretical background, I would not be supplying any foundation for the conceptual process nor any comprehensive justification for the results. By limiting myself to the presentation of my own model of reality, I would be presenting a fragmented thesis and would not be able to follow up with a constructive proposal. There are perhaps many people better qualified than I am to elaborate a credible or usable model of reality. There is no one to my knowledge who has an awareness of the environmental consequences of the thesis here presented, much less made a serious effort at the deployment of any proposal.\n The thesis demands a transfiguration of the earth without defiling or disfiguring its own cosmic aspects. The performance of the professionals, engineers, architects, and planners are doodles on the back of a cosmic phenomenon and will not do. Unlimited doodling produces squalor. In fact, the massive intrusion of irrelevance is enough sand in the cogs of civilization to spew out evil, in a very pragmatic sense. The exponential savagery of chaos is the outcome of false order, an order deprived of structure.\n This work seeks a definition of the problem in its more general terms, an environment suitable for the species of man, a coherence that may be historically valid. To keep the reader engaged in the continuity of the process and conscious of its cosmic scale (and thus meaningful only within such dimensions), terms have been used that reiterate this concern. For the purpose of self-clarification, a  theory has thus been developing parallel to the planning ideas. A theory is a framework of reference per se, fairly neutral. The use one makes of it measures its validity. Though constant adherence to a theory may sometimes dull the mind, it is a way of seeking and achieving coherence in one\u2019s work. One tests both theory and the new idea by wedging one into the other. What follows is such a framework, whose great limitations do not completely cancel the advantage the author has derived from its personal construction.\n To help the reader understand the material presented here, I have adopted two devices. The first is the use of diagrams to illustrate roughly the concepts.  The second is the use of italics for the fraction of the written parts that I feel carries or condenses the ideas. It is possible for the reader to go through the italicized portions in an uninterrupted sequence and then come back to the complete text. Each chapter was written on a different occasion, a partial explanation for the lack of continuity.\n A warning is necessary for the student. The graphics are not to be taken literally. The symbolism is evident and is characterized by the different hands that helped to produce it. The complexity of the system would in any case preclude the possibility of well-thought-out detail in the general context in which this book should remain.\n   \u201cMan can be understood only by  ascending from physics, chemistry, biology, and geology. In other words he is  first of all a cosmic problem.\u201d    Teilhard de Chardin  \u201cReflections of Energy\u201d  Review of scientific questions  (orig. text)  \uf1ab (October 1952)\n  \u201c\u2026that power from which we derive so much pride, what is it in truth but the subjective consciousness of a progressive weld of humanity to the physical universe of which the great determinisms now act, no longer as formidable outsiders, but as through thought itself, colonizing us for a silent world of which we have become the agents?\u201d   (orig. text)  \uf1ab   Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss  Tristes Tropiques (1955)\n   This work has a critical part and a constructive part. They are treated concurrently in the first section, where criticism is coupled with what in my view is a perspective suggesting a greater coherence. To help focus the problem, I have simplified it greatly. I do not feel this invalidates the results because the argument is kept in the context of a peach not being a potato and not of a peach being yellow or peachy; and the results are not a blueprint for a city-civilization but only a guideline toward a new option. After this first part follows the development of thirty schemes based on theoretical propositions and then a proposed micro-experiment in  Arcosanti by the Cosanti Foundation.\n In the critical inquiry it is assumed that the best hopes for contemporary man have been fulfilled and the urban medium has been cleared of slums and cleansed of ills and grievances. If there is no mention of segregated minorities, of slum clearance, of exploiter and exploited, of tax unfairness, of bossism, of children killed by delivery trucks, of skid-row peripatetics, of  pets not allowed, of profit incentives, of self-help, it is because one assumes that in time the skill of man will take care of them all.  The foundation of equity is thus granted. There is then happy man within the full-fledged  coordination of city and suburban expanse. Megalopoly stretches over the continents from top to bottom, from left to right, emerging victorious and shiny above an unending and felicitous suburbia.\n The critical end of this work is to confute the truth of such a condition; that is to say, such a hope is doubly false. It is false because it is not feasible; it is utopian in its inner contradictions and its detachment from the tenets of life itself. It is false in the sense of being deadly, a scourge many times worse than the squalor of present days.\n Life\u2019s bulk is negated when megalopoly and suburbia are taken as the environmental bulk. Their existence and hypothetical validity are at best only peripheral, the spurious fringe to a far more substantial structure. The inquiry is then into the construction of a congruous environment that such structure may define.\n The questioning implicit in the first part of this book is aimed at the validity of the ideal we have put to ourselves. The contention is that this ideal is the result of a mortification of the worth of man and a partly involuntary abdication from the fullness of life, that it is fundamentally an evil, antilife proposition. The constructive end of this work is not to find either a timid alternative or a cure-all answer. What is attempted is the clarification of some of the very elementary processes by which the life of man and society seem to evolve, and then, using these concepts, the effort to define broadly some concrete organism coherent to the platform of the fundamentals reached, a platform regarded as historically valid. The position taken is evolutionist. That is to say,  I have little doubt that life in general and human life in particular can be symbolized by a vector and cannot be symbolized by a random pattern. Vectoriality is the character of living reality, and the care of man is basically a willful or unconscious action with or against it. ( Figures 9,  10) Antivector forces collect themselves in the unlimited reservoirs of entropy. The provector forces are striving at the reduction and eventual consumption of such reservoirs through a process called here the aesthetogenesis of the real, process and end, themselves the stuff of life. In this context utopia is the disavowal of any vectorial urge that might exist in the species of man and a settlement for something less than engrossing, for instance, a giving up in the  calm sea of affluence.\n      Constantine Doxiadis presents a frightening world map. The American continent is covered with a kind of fabric that reminds one of a dark and torn flannel worn by a strong torso. The holes are large but are just holes. ( Figure 1) The dark fabric is  ecumenopoly, the universal city. The holes are the areas where the earth breathes and renews itself: a map of despair. Doxiadis forecasts a continent transformed into a human backyard. The teeming human ants are everywhere, and everywhere are human ants. Nor will the holes be spared. They will not be pockets of farmland or wilderness. They will be dotted by subcolonies and will be invaded weekly by waves of schizophrenic vacationers and seasonally flooded by a tide of discouraged suburbanites given to temporary nomadism.\n The quasi-unbroken membrane of biological and mental matter prognosticated by Doxiadis will be sheltered by the nonbiological paraphernalia of the man-made. The Athens and the Florence of the Golden Ages will be stamped out in thousands of copies\u2014ten thousand of them for a mass of one billion, one hundred thousand for a mass of ten billion, and so on. The thinking is that of a creature bound to a surface existence.  He has been given a surface enveloping a solid sphere, and he is doing his level best to carpet it with one or two or five layers of performance. It will not do.\n One hundred to five hundred layers of performance will grossly produce a shrinkage of ecumenopoly to one one-hundredth of its suggested size. Instead of a stagnant and far too extensive layer of pseudo-urban environment, there would then be fibers of dense vitality running over continents and seas, ribbing the surface of the planet. ( Figure 2) They would actually be urban rivers whose core would serve for transportation and communication, whose top would be an endless airport, and the sides the actual urban substance. In the foundations and around them, the producing plants would be cybernetically organized. Taking off from the urban rivers, or coming to them, would be urban systems of smaller dimension ending or taking off from large modular cities, the subject of this book.  The material presented here is a schematic reference to modular urban systems that find full coherence as appendices and as origins of the urban rivers, carriers of the bulk of civilization.\n   The demands of acceleration and deceleration, a slavery peculiar to matter in motion, a slavery not imposed on light, ultimately force on matter the inescapable need for miniaturization.  Miniaturization is the process that minimizes the prime handicap of the physical world: the time-space strait jacket. This law or rule is so universal as to guide investigation possibly to the ultimate convergence among the apparent divergences that occur within the universal stuff of matter and energy and the puzzle of life versus death.   Miniaturize or die has been the key rule for incipient life.\n As the subject of this work is the city, one might anticipate here, and not just metaphorically, that miniaturize-or-die is and remains the condition sine qua non for the development of the social, collective animal contained in the towns and cities of the world. Secularization, the existential mark of our present, will be allowed or rejected by the advent or not of the physical miniaturization of our urban centers.  This occurrence is not just the key to success but the aim evolution has put to itself at this conjuncture of history.\n It could be argued that nothing new ever occurs in time, if not that a certain and constant polarity is slowly producing, in increasing numbers, clusters of performances in ever more complex systems. The living organism would be the collection from the four corners of the universe of a number of compatible happenings. Conception would be the trigger for such an implosive process.\n In the case of the mind, where the unlimited possible implodes into the finite real, the farther away it finds food for its development and the more numerous the data caught in its net, the greater is its power, that is to say, the greater is its miniaturizing power, which depends in turn upon the degree of its own miniaturization.  It is as if step-by-step evolution would take account of itself and make a complete synopsis (miniaturization) of its achievements in order to have at its finger tips all the available power for the next leap ( Figure 3), demonstrating that the container of universality or wholeness must be the miniaturization of the best instruments available.\n       In a sense, there is miniaturization of matter and miniaturization of performance. One copes with the challenge of the future to the degree of success permissible by the degree of the other (and vice versa).\n Evolution suggests a pulsatory behavior that has devised a miniaturizing process for each step moving from matter to mind: miniaturization from unending and spare cosmic existence to geological matter, miniaturization from geological matter to organic stuff, miniaturization from organic to organism, miniaturization from organism to animality, miniaturization from animality to reflectivity (man). Now that man is working at the full characterization of the ultraorganism of the human group, another miniaturization is mandatory.\n All these successive miniaturizations are necessary because of the incremental complexity inherent in the progression. The greater the complexity, the greater the spatial and temporal obstacles to performance. Thus the necessity of fitting more into less, both spatially and temporally speaking, is proportionally greater. Furthermore, one can distinguish two kinds of miniaturization:  general miniaturization\u2014from the possible to the real;  specific miniaturization\u2014the evolutionary complexification of the real. ( Figure 4)\n If the universe is a deterministic machine, general miniaturization now belongs specifically to man, as he is the one whose inquietude makes the choice among many possibilities a more than theoretical decision.\n That which miniaturizes into the real, but does not subsequently undertake  specific self-miniaturization, becomes one of the dead limbs of history and is given back to naught. The society of man faces this danger, and because of the scale of his existence relative to the size of the earth, man is also directly endangering the existence of the earth itself. Inwardly, any organism is a superb device, a marvel in complexity, compactness, and congruence\u2014a miniaturized universe. Outwardly, as a member of a group, it is little more than a torpid fraction of a cumbersome mechanism.  The superanimal constituting society has not undergone the miniaturizing metamorphosis, and it is by its very nature totally unprepared for the performance of its designated task.\n Society must become a true organism that will perform adequately. This will be made possible through the power of miniaturization. The physical miniaturization of its container, the city, is a necessary step to this end.\n If we do not succeed in specifically miniaturizing our society, which has come from a possible existence in the species of man to a condition of elemental concreteness through the phase of general miniaturization, then this same society will not accede to the existential dimension of groping evolution.\n Society has not yet been given the self-perpetuating stamina that characterizes organisms. It has to be constantly reasoned or forced into accepting its own exis\n......", "posttime": "2021-08-06 00:48:44", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

users in Europe are under the General Data Protection Regulation. Theoretically, the one not respecting it may have a fine up to the biggest amount between 20 million or up to 4% of total revenues.\n GDPR entered into force without tooling to make it happen. 3 years later the market is still not ready to implement it.\n So far, according to our  latest report of GDPR, the huge majority of companies (almost all of them to be frank) are not compliant. And there is a reason for that. It is because GDPR has been thought and created without even the idea of the tools to implement it, with regulators believing the market will adapt and find the solutions. But the reality is that companies are today not really just able to implement GDPR correctly. They still did not realize their cultural digital transformation, still struggling going into the cloud, and you want them to respect a high level of ethics and technology as per the GDPR? Impossible. Even major vendors selling Privacy solutions are not able to deliver real compliance. Most of the time, they just sell solutions to declare how a customer could be theoretically compliant. They declare documents and processing activities in a static manner, not linked to what really happens in the system. 88% of companies still rely on Word and Excel for their GDPR compliance. And the remaining 12% percent rely on softwares that could be considered as augmented versions of Excel, with \u201cspecific\u201d data models. No intelligence can be observed in these \u201cDPO toolsets\u201d. The current compliance market and technology stack is flawed by design. And all companies are at risk of fines, and still not able to neither be transparent about the use of personal data with their users, nor to transform good data governance into operational efficiency. It is losing all the way down.\n  Do you know how much is the smallest GDPR fine ever given? 28\u20ac, given by Hungarian Data Protection Regulator. Do you know who was targeted : Google Ireland. With fines like this, GDPR was not scaring anyone. Even despite the French CNIL who gave $50M of fine to Google on the other side of the spectrum, GDPR fines were seen just as a reminder, not a sentence of punishment. The total sum of all the fines delivered by data regulations authorities, before the Amazon fine of last week, was around 300 millions dollars. It could be scary for some companies to lose a few millions because of a data breach, or because of keeping customer data too long. But you have to compare the cost of compliance.  It has been estimated that the total cost of GDPR compliance, just for the US market to be around $150Bn. If you extrapolate for EU companies as well as for the global economy, we could reach a few hundreds billions of dollars to be (badly) compliant. So when you compare a few hundred millions of fines over 3 years, versus a few hundred of billions to set GDPR up and maintain it over time, you can see that the fines were definitely not scary.  But last Friday, the Luxembourg data protection authority decided to fine Amazon for almost $1Bn ($887M)\n   And this is totally a game changer. It is a game changer because it makes the risk event \u201cgetting fined for GDPR\u201d finally a risk that is not worth taking anymore. Now, every company has received the message that \u201cyou must not mess with GDPR\u201d.\n  Before this news, the privacy software tooling management market was expected to be worth $8Bn by 2023. We will see exactly what will be the impact of these estimates, but one thing is sure, the market will never be the same. The GDPR stick is there, it is big and hits hard. It is time for companies to raise their level of personal data ethics until they get reminded to do it the hard way. There is another way to think about GDPR. Instead of a stick, GDPR could be carrot for many businesses and an enabler of value.  This is what the latest Cisco 2020 Data Benchmark study shows. On 2500+ companies interviewed, more than 70% of them found that a better personal data management  :\n   It also demonstrates than the average Return on Investment of Privacy investment was 225%, and that for an average spending of $1,2M, the average return was $2,7M. And this is only the ROI we can calculate, not including all the positive externalities like employee engagement and loyalty, ecosystem trust, etc...\n  Perception is not the reality anymore, when it comes to deal with GDPR compliance and privacy concerns. You can see GDPR as a stick or a carrot. But the only thing that is sure is that if you don&#39;t care about it, GDPR will take care about you.\n  &#34;By three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest; Second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest.&#34;\n  PS : if you want to become a Privacy Engineer want to be part of the team who is making GDPR compliance a reality by building easy to use APIs for developers, we are hiring all roles from all over the world.
