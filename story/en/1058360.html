The Canadian company said no.</p><p>   Amazon.com Inc.去年告诉Smart-Thermostat Maker Ecobee，即使客户不使用它们，也必须从其启用语音的设备中提供科技巨头数据。加拿大公司表示没有。</p><p>  The smaller company feared that complying with the demand would violate customer privacy, said a person familiar with the episode. Ecobee’s devices work with  Alexa, Amazon’s voice-powered assistant, and it already shared some data with Amazon, the person said. Moreover, the company worried Amazon would glean insights from Ecobee’s users that it could  use in competing products.</p><p>  一个熟悉这一集的人表示，该较小的公司担心遵守需求违反客户的隐私。 ECOBEE的设备与Alexa，Amazon的语音供电助手合作，它已经与亚马逊共享了一些数据，该人表示。此外，该公司担忧亚马逊将从Ecobee的用户讨论它可以在竞争产品中使用。</p><p>  Amazon responded that if Ecobee didn’t serve up its data, the refusal could affect Ecobee’s ability to sell on Amazon’s retail platform, the person said.</p><p>  亚马逊回应说，如果Ecobee没有提供数据，那么该人表示，如果ECOBEE没有提供其数据，拒绝会影响Ecobee在亚马逊零售平台上销售的能力。</p><p>  Amazon’s tactic of leveraging dominance in one business to compel partners to accept terms from another is a familiar one, said former Amazon executives and officials at companies on the receiving end. Amazon’s tactics, they said, go beyond typical product bundling and tough negotiating in part because the company threatens punitive action on vital services it offers, such as its retail platform.</p><p>  亚马逊在一个企业中利用主导地位的策略强迫合作伙伴接受另一个人的术语是一个熟悉的，以前的亚马逊高管和在收到的公司上的官员表示。他们说，亚马逊的策略超越了典型的产品捆绑和艰难的谈判，部分原因是该公司对其提供的重要服务，例如其零售平台的重要服务。</p><p>  Partners often acquiesce to Amazon’s demands, the executives and officials said, because of its power in a range of market sectors.</p><p>  合作伙伴经常默认亚马逊的要求，主管和官员所说，因为它在一系列市场部门的权力。</p><p>  An Amazon spokesman, Jack Evans, said Ecobee still sells on its site. Ecobee spokeswoman Andie Weissman said “Amazon continues to be a valued Ecobee partner.” The person familiar with the negotiation said talks continue.</p><p>  杰克发言人杰克埃文斯说，Ecobee仍然在其网站上销售。 Ecobee发言人Andie Weissman表示，“亚马逊继续成为一个有价值的Ecobee合作伙伴。”熟悉谈判的人表示会谈继续。 </p><p>  David Barnett, chief executive officer of PopSockets LLC, maker of cellphone accessories, said Amazon employees can make these kinds of threats because the company is so powerful. “Their employees are going to try to hit their goals by whatever means they can, including these asymmetric relationships,” he said.</p><p>亚马逊员工的Popsockets LLC首席执行官David Barnett（Popsockets LLC）首席执行官表示，亚马逊员工可以制作这些威胁，因为公司是如此强大。他说：“他们的员工将尝试通过任何意义，包括这些不对称的关系，包括这些不对称的关系。”</p><p>  Mr. Barnett, who testified before the  U.S. House Antitrust Subcommittee last year, said Amazon used its retail-platform power and a promise to rid its marketplace of counterfeit PopSockets products to compel PopSockets to spend more on Amazon’s ad service.</p><p>  Barnett先生在去年的美国屋反托拉斯小组委员会之前作证，亚马逊使用其零售平台电力和承诺将其假冒Popsockets产品的市场摆脱，以强迫Popsockets在亚马逊的广告服务上花费更多。</p><p>  In his testimony, he said: “One has to ask, ‘How is it that such a successful business maintains partnerships with so many companies while bullying them?’” Because of Amazon’s power, he said, “they have to tolerate it.”</p><p>  在他的证词中，他说：“一个人必须问，”这么成功的企业如何与这么多公司保持伙伴关系，同时欺负它们？“因为亚马逊的力量，他说：”他们必须容忍它。“</p><p>  Amazon’s Mr. Evans said the company doesn’t require payment for anti-counterfeiting services like those offered to PopSockets.</p><p>  亚马逊的埃文斯先生表示，该公司不需要支付对Popsockets提供的反假冒服务。</p><p>      “Amazon always tries to negotiate the best terms for our customers—we would be doing them a disservice if we didn’t,” Mr. Evans said. “And it shouldn’t surprise anyone that we negotiate across our business units—that’s normal practice anywhere. Many of our customers and partners do this, and usually are seeking to include other aspects of our business in their agreements with us.”</p><p>      “亚马逊总是试图谈判我们的客户的最佳术语 - 如果我们没有，我们将以争夺者为他们，”埃文斯先生说。 “并且不应该让任何人谈判我们的业务部门 - 这在任何地方都正常练习。我们的许多客户和合作伙伴这样做，通常正在寻求与我们的协议中业务的其他方面。“</p><p>  Opportunities for Amazon to link business lines are significant, with its broad operations in retail,  cloud computing, digital ads, streaming content, voice-assistant technology and logistics. It is one of very few companies that command such sizable positions in so many disparate industries.</p><p>  亚马逊联机业务线的机会很重要，其在零售，云计算，数字广告，流媒体内容，语音辅助技术和物流中的广泛运营。它是非常少数公司的公司之一，这些公司在这么多不同的行业中指挥如此相当大的职位。</p><p>  It is No. 1 or No. 2 by market share in many businesses it operates in, according to estimates by research firms and congressional findings. Amazon’s online retail platform is by far the largest in the U.S., and the company is the third-largest digital advertiser by revenue in the U.S., according to research firm eMarketer. It is the biggest cloud-computing company globally by revenue, according to research firm  Gartner  Inc. Amazon’s Fire TV devices account for a third of all streaming-media-player installed base in the U.S., according to research firm Parks Associates. It commands major positions in areas such as voice-enabled speakers, book sales and online groceries.</p><p>  根据研究公司和国会调查结果的估计，它在许多企业中的市场份额中的1号或第2号。据研究公司Emarketer称，亚马逊在美国的在线零售平台迄今为止，该公司是美国第三大数字广告商。据研究公司公园员工的统计，据研究公司公园员工称，它是亚马逊的最大云计算公司Gartner Inc.的最大云计算公司。它命令在启用语音扬声器等地区的主要位置，书籍销售和在线杂货等领域。 </p><p>   When a company uses its dominance in a market to impose terms on customers, it can raise antitrust concerns. Regulators have long examined whether a dominant company is limiting customer choice by forcing buyers that want one product or service to buy another as well, a tactic sometimes called “tying.” Federal authorities have pursued tying allegations as part of antitrust lawsuits against companies ranging from John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Co., broken up in 1911, to  Microsoft  Corp. , which in 2001 reached a  settlement with the Justice Department over several allegations, without admitting wrongdoing, including that it unfairly tied its internet browser to its operating system.</p><p>当公司在市场上使用其主导地位来对客户施加条款时，它可以提高反垄断问题。监管机构已经长期审查了统治公司是否通过强迫想要购买产品或服务购买的买家提供另一个产品或服务的买家来限制客户选择，这是一个有时称为“捆绑”的策略。联邦当局追求绑定指控，作为抵御John D. Rockefeller的标准石油公司的反垄断诉讼的一部分，于1911年分为Microsoft Corp.，Microsoft Corp.在2001年与司法部达成了几个指控，而不承认不法行为，包括它不公平地将其互联网浏览器绑定到其操作系统。</p><p>  U.S. lawmakers, the Federal Trade Commission and regulators in multiple states are examining competitive practices of Amazon and other tech giants. In October, the  Antitrust Subcommittee completed a 16-month investigation into potential anticompetitive practices of Amazon,  Apple  Inc.,  Facebook  Inc. and  Alphabet  Inc.’s Google. The  committee concluded that Amazon had “monopoly power” over its sellers, and cited evidence that Amazon had leveraged its dominance in online commerce as pressure in negotiations with firms in other lines of business.</p><p>  美国立法者，多个国家的联邦贸易委员会和监管机构正在检查亚马逊和其他科技巨头的竞争实践。 10月份，反托拉斯小组委员会为亚马逊，Apple Inc.，Facebook Inc.和Alphabet Inc.的谷歌进行了16个月的潜在反竞争做法。委员会得出结论，亚马逊在其卖方中有“垄断权力”，并引用了亚马逊利用其在线商务的主导地位作为与其他业务范围的公司谈判的压力。</p><p>    Amazon disputed the report’s conclusions, saying in  a blog post that “large companies are not dominant by definition, and the presumption that success can only be the result of anti-competitive behavior is simply wrong.”</p><p>    亚马逊对报告的结论有争议，在一个博客帖子中说：“大公司不通过定义占主导地位，并取得成功只能成为反竞争行为的结果是错误的。”</p><p>  Antitrust specialists say proving that behavior such as tying is illegal can be difficult. Tying is “hard to enforce easily,” said Gary Reback, a lawyer at Carr &amp; Ferrell LLP who has worked on major antitrust lawsuits and was an opponent of Microsoft in its legal battles over competition. Litigators tend to focus on “monopoly maintenance” in antitrust lawsuits rather than trying to prove tying, he said.</p><p>  反托拉斯专家说，证明捆绑是非法的行为可能很困难。 Carr＆amp的律师Gary Reback表示，捆绑是“容易实施”，“ Ferrell LLP曾在主要的反托拉斯诉讼中工作，并在其法律战斗中致力于竞争中的竞争对手。他说，诉讼人倾向于关注在反垄断诉讼中的“垄断维护”，而不是试图证明捆绑。</p><p>  Ecobee had long dealt with Amazon. It received funding in 2016 from the Alexa Fund, Amazon’s venture-capital arm, which remains a minority shareholder.  Amazon sometimes competes with companies it invests in.</p><p>  Ecobee与亚马逊长期以来。它于2016年获得资金来自Alexa Fund，亚马逊的风险资本臂，仍然是少数股东。亚马逊有时与它投资的公司竞争。</p><p>  Amazon’s Alexa assistant is one of several voice assistants that big technology companies have promoted in recent years to embed their products deeper into people’s lives, competing with Apple’s Siri and Google Assistant. When customers use the “Alexa command” in a product that is enabled by Alexa to perform tasks such as turning on the lights or raising the temperature, Amazon receives details of those interactions.</p><p>  亚马逊的Alexa Assistant是几个语音助理之一，即近年来大型科技公司促进了将产品更深入地融入人们的生活，与苹果的SIRI和谷歌助理竞争。当客户在Alexa启用的产品中使用“Alexa命令”以执行打开灯或提高温度等任务时，亚马逊接收这些交互的详细信息。</p><p>  More recently, Amazon has asked Ecobee and other Alexa-enabled-device sellers to share “proactive state” data, which would update Amazon about the device’s status at all times, even when the customer isn’t using the Alexa command, said executives at companies who say Amazon has asked them to provide such data. That could give Amazon information such as the temperature of a user’s home, whether the user’s doors are locked and when the user last opened the garage doors, for instance.</p><p>  最近，亚马逊已经要求Ecobee和其他启用Alexa的设备销售商分享“主动状态”数据，这将始终更新亚马逊关于设备的状态，即使客户不使用Alexa命令，高管也会说那些说亚马逊的公司要求他们提供这些数据。这可以提供亚马逊信息，例如用户家的温度，用户的门是否被锁定，并且当用户最后打开车库门时。 </p><p>    Amazon’s Mr. Evans said the company uses the proactive-state data to improve the customer experience and make better recommendations. He said customers are informed that the data will be shared with Amazon when linking their accounts.</p><p>亚马逊埃文斯先生表示，该公司使用主动状态数据来改善客户体验并提高建议。他表示，客户被告知数据将在链接其帐户时与亚马逊共享数据。</p><p>  Amazon’s online retail platform accounts for two-fifths of e-commerce sales, according to eMarketer. Losing that sales channel could devastate a company like Ecobee.</p><p>  据Emarketer称，亚马逊的在线零售平台占电子商务销售额的二分之二。失去销售渠道可能会像Ecobee这样的公司摧毁一家公司。</p><p>  Amazon had also told Ecobee that if it didn’t comply with the data demands, it could potentially not retain Alexa certification on future models or have access to big selling events such as Prime Day, said one of the people.</p><p>  亚马逊也告诉了Ecobee，如果它没有遵守数据所需，它可能无法保留未来模型的alexa认证，或者可以访问诸如粉末之类的大销售事件，称之一。</p><p>   Last year, Amazon pressured  AT&amp;T  Inc.’s WarnerMedia to put its new HBO Max streaming service on Amazon’s Prime Video if it wanted the service to go on another Amazon platform, said people involved in the discussions. The AT&amp;T unit’s HBO service that came before Max had a channel on Prime Video, part of Amazon’s Prime platform.</p><p>   去年，亚马逊在＆amp; T Inc.的令人沮丧的是，如果它希望服务去另一个亚马逊平台，就可以在亚马逊的巅峰视频上放置新的HBO Max Freement Service，表示参与讨论。在Max之前出现的AT＆amp; T单元的HBO服务在亚马逊的主要平台的一部分是在Prime Video上的频道。</p><p>  Relationships between programmers and Amazon’s Prime Video have often been tense. Amazon sells subscriptions to other entertainment companies’ channels in return for a significant cut of that revenue as well as a slice of advertising inventory if the platform has commercials. Amazon also retains nearly all the valuable customer data and viewing habits, according to executives who have struck deals for Prime Video channels.</p><p>  程序员和亚马逊的主要视频之间的关系通常是紧张的。亚马逊向其他娱乐公司的渠道销售订阅，以换取该收入的大量削减，以及该平台有商业广告的广告清单。据高管们掌握了PRIME视频渠道的优惠师，亚马逊还保留了几乎所有有价值的客户数据和观看习惯。</p><p>  As WarnerMedia was preparing to launch HBO Max, it told Amazon it didn’t want the service to be a channel on Prime Video, but did want to be on Amazon’s Fire TV, part of a separate unit, said the people involved in the discussions. Amazon replied to WarnerMedia that it couldn’t be on Fire TV without being on Prime Video, they said.</p><p>  随着令人武装的准备发射HBO Max，它告诉亚马逊它不希望这项服务成为Prime视频的频道，但是希望在亚马逊的火电视台上，一部分单独的单位，表示参与讨论的人。他们说，亚马逊回复了令警报，它不能在没有追求诗歌视频的情况下。</p><p>  Amazon’s Mr. Evans said Amazon pushed for HBO Max to be on both platforms because that is better for customers.</p><p>  亚马逊的埃文斯先生表示，亚马逊推动了HBO Max在两个平台上，因为这对客户来说更好。 </p><p>  When HBO Max launched in May 2020, it was absent from Fire TV and Prime Video. It took nearly six months of behind-the-scenes battling for that to change,  The Wall Street Journal reported at the time. WarnerMedia eventually agreed to keep HBO on Prime Video until this year’s end. To help seal the deal to get HBO Max on Fire TV, it extended a lucrative contract with the cloud-computing arm Amazon Web Services, or AWS, said the people involved in the discussions. The Information, an online news publication,  earlier reported some details of the negotiations and HBO Max’s expanded AWS deal.</p><p>当HBO Max于2020年5月推出时，它缺乏火电视和主要视频。在当时的华尔街日报报道，它需要近六个月的幕后幕后作战。令人梦想最终同意在今年的结束之前让HBO保持奖励视频。为了帮助密封交易让HBO Max在火电视上，它与云计算Amazon Web服务或AWS表示有利可图的合同，表示参与讨论。该信息，在线新闻出版物，早些时候报告了谈判和HBO Max的一些细节扩大了AWS交易。</p><p>    Executives from HBO Max complained about Amazon’s behavior during the negotiations to the House Antitrust Subcommittee investigating Amazon’s business practices, said people familiar with the probe.</p><p>    来自HBO Max的高管在探索的人们讨论了亚马逊反托拉斯小组委员会的谈判期间，亚马逊的行为抱怨。</p><p>  Amazon’s Mr. Evans said that there are occasions, including its talks with HBO, when companies are interested in exploring partnerships across multiple Amazon businesses.</p><p>  亚马逊的埃文斯先生表示，有些场合，包括与HBO的会谈，当时公司有兴趣探索多个亚马逊企业的伙伴关系。</p><p>  A former longtime senior AWS executive said that in recent years AWS has discussed how to better leverage its cloud clout in broader Amazon negotiations. Because of Amazon’s size, it is common for companies to work with many different business units within Amazon. Some AWS customers also sell large volumes of their products on Amazon.com.</p><p>  一位前长期高级AWS执行官表示，近年来AWS已经讨论了如何更好地利用其云团在更广泛的亚马逊谈判中。由于亚马逊的规模，公司常常在亚马逊内使用许多不同的业务单位。一些AWS客户还在Amazon.com上销售大量产品。</p><p>  Amazon’s Mr. Evans said that negotiations often don’t occur in a silo and that Amazon and its partners often seek to reach agreements that cover multiple aspects of their businesses and Amazon’s.</p><p>  亚马逊的埃文斯先生表示，谈判往往不会发生在筒仓中，亚马逊及其合作伙伴经常寻求达到其业务和亚马逊的多个方面的协议。</p><p>  Amazon over the years has used its established muscle  to build a new business in advertising. That business has grown from a relatively small unit a decade ago to what is now the third-largest digital-ad operation by revenue in the U.S. after Google and Facebook, according to eMarketer, with revenue of $21.5 billion last year.</p><p>  多年来亚马逊已经使用其建立的肌肉来建立一个新的商业广告。该业务十年前已经从一个相对较小的单位增长到现在，在谷歌和Facebook之后，在谷歌和Facebook之后的收入是现在的第三大数字广告运营，该荣获量去年收入为215亿美元。</p><p>  Do you think there are grounds for an antitrust investigation into Amazon? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>  您认为是否存在对亚马逊的反托拉斯调查的理由？为什么或者为什么不？加入下面的对话。 </p><p>  In 2013, in a previously unreported episode, Prime Video was in negotiations with Viacom Inc.—now part of ViacomCBS Inc.—to buy more than $200 million in content from the media company to stream on Amazon’s Prime platform, said people involved with the deal.</p><p>2013年，在以前未报告的剧集中，Prime视频与ViaCom Inc.的谈判 - 现在的ViaComcbs Inc.的一部分 - 从媒体公司购买超过2亿美元的内容到亚马逊的主要平台，表示参与其中交易。</p><p>  Amazon’s advertising business at the time was nascent, and Amazon’s management team wanted to expand it quickly, said people involved in the talks. Prime Video and advertising both fell under the purview of Jeff Blackburn, an Amazon executive who belonged to the circle of top advisers to CEO  Jeff Bezos.</p><p>  亚马逊当时的广告业务是新生，亚马逊的管理团队想快速扩展它，表示参与会谈。 Prime视频和广告既涉及属于首席执行官杰夫·贝佐斯圈的亚马逊高级顾问圈的杰夫布拉特盖的默认范围。</p><p>  In the middle of negotiations, he instructed his team to tell Viacom that Amazon would buy the content only if Viacom bought millions of dollars in advertising across Amazon’s properties, said people involved in the deal. Viacom reluctantly agreed.</p><p>  在谈判中间，他指示他的团队告诉ViaCom，只有亚马逊在亚马逊的房产上广告广告中购买了数百万美元的广告时，亚马逊才能购买亚马逊。威盛不情愿地同意了。</p><p>  Mr. Blackburn, who left Amazon this year, didn’t respond to inquiries. Amazon’s Mr. Evans said the company’s “individual businesses build partnerships independently with other companies.”</p><p>  今年离开亚马逊的布莱克本先生并没有回复询问。亚马逊的埃文斯先生表示，该公司的“个人企业与其他公司独立建立伙伴关系”。</p><p>  In 2018,  AMC Networks  Inc.’s contract was up for negotiation with Amazon Prime, where it had channels for its Shudder and Sundance Now franchises. The new terms Amazon was proposing were much more lucrative for Amazon than they had been in the prior contract, said people involved in the deal. Amazon was demanding more revenue from subscriptions of the channels and pressed AMC to spend significant amounts on advertising across its platforms, including Fire TV and Amazon’s IMDb movie website, the people said.</p><p>  2018年，AMC Networks Inc.的合同是谈判与亚马逊素数，在那里它有渠道为其颤抖，日光现在特许经营权。亚马逊的新术语对于亚马逊而言，亚马逊比他们在现有合同中更有利可图，所以参与了这笔交易。人们说，亚马逊要求渠道订阅的收入更多，并按下AMC在其平台上为广告提供大量的广告，包括火电视和亚马逊的IMDB电影网站。</p><p>  AMC pushed back on the terms, the people said. Weeks before the contract was set to expire, Amazon disabled the ability for Amazon Prime members to subscribe to AMC’s channels, they said. The timing coincided with Halloween. The weeks around the holiday are the busiest time of year for AMC to sign up new subscribers, with around a quarter of new subscribers enrolling during that period, the people said.</p><p>  人们说，AMC推回这些条款。合同将于到期前几周，亚马逊禁用了亚马逊总成员订阅AMC的渠道的能力，他们说。时序与万圣节恰逢。人们说，假期周围的周数是AMC的最繁忙的AMC，围绕四分之一的新订阅者在此期间注册。</p><p>  Within two weeks of Amazon’s suspending subscriptions, AMC agreed to pay Amazon a higher revenue share, although not as high as Amazon was asking, and agreed to the advertising terms, they said.</p><p>  在亚马逊暂停订阅的两周内，AMC同意支付亚马逊的收入份额较高，虽然亚马逊并不高，但同意广告条款，他们说。 </p><p>  An AMC spokeswoman said: “We had productive renewal conversations with Amazon in 2018 around our targeted streaming services Shudder and Sundance Now. Since then, we have expanded our relationship with the launch of AMC+ and Amazon continues to be a great partner that has contributed to the service’s fast growth.”</p><p>AMC发言人表示：“我们在2018年在我们的目标流媒体服务周围与亚马逊有生产力的续展对话，现在是颤抖和日光。从那时起，我们已经扩大了我们与AMC +的推出的关系，亚马逊继续成为一个伟大的合作伙伴，这为服务的快速增长做出了贡献。“</p><p>   Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the Democrat who represents Amazon’s Seattle-area home district and is vice chair of the House Antitrust Subcommittee, said Amazon also has used tying tactics to build part of its logistics arm, called Fulfillment by Amazon, or FBA.</p><p>   代表亚马逊西雅图地区家庭区的民主党人普拉米尔·杰帕帕尔·贾亚帕（Pramila Jayapal）表示，亚马逊也使用绑定策略来构建其物流臂的一部分，称为亚马逊的履行或FBA。</p><p>  Amazon takes a percentage of sales on its platform by outside vendors. Since 2006, it has also charged sellers who sign up to have FBA handle warehousing, processing and shipping of their items. Today, nearly two-thirds of sellers on Amazon.com in the U.S. use FBA, according to Marketplace Pulse, a research firm. FBA is a pillar of the Amazon Logistics unit that is separate from the retail operation and that rivals  FedEx  Corp. and  United Parcel Service  Inc.</p><p>  亚马逊由外部供应商占据其平台上的百分比。自2006年以来，它还向卖方收取卖方，他们注册了FBA处理仓储，加工和运输物品。如今，今天，在美国的澳大利多赛中，近三分之二的卖家在美国使用FBA。 FBA是亚马逊物流单元的支柱，与零售运营分开，竞争对手FedEx Corp.和United Parcel Service Inc.</p><p>  Ms. Jayapal said sellers testified privately that Amazon compelled them to use its fulfillment service by making it harder to sell goods on its retail platform. In particular, access to Amazon’s coveted “Buy Box”—which determines which seller of an item is featured for a sale—and getting good placement in search results, are contingent upon a seller’s participating in the fulfillment program, she said.</p><p>  Jayapal女士表示，卖家私下作证，亚马逊迫使他们通过在其零售平台上销售商品来使用其履行服务。特别是，进入亚马逊的令人垂涎的“买箱” - 为什么在搜索结果上销售和获得良好安置的物品的销售额是指的，而且在卖方参与履行计划的情况下，她说。</p><p>    Jerry Kavesh, who sells apparel and footwear on Amazon, said he recently pulled some inventory from FBA because he couldn’t afford the cost. Since then, he said, he has noticed a slowdown in sales for those items compared with ones he kept in the fulfillment program.</p><p>    在亚马逊上销售服装和鞋子的Jerry Kavesh表示，他最近从FBA撤回了一些库存，因为他买不起成本。从那时起，他说，与在履行计划中保存的人相比，他已经注意到这些物品的销售放缓。</p><p>  “There’s a ramification for not using FBA,” he said. “It impacts your search-ability and impacts your Buy Box opportunities because FBA trumps everything when it comes to the Buy Box.”</p><p>  “没有使用FBA有一个分支，”他说。 “它会影响您的搜索能力，并影响您的购买框机会，因为FBA在购买框中胜过一切。”</p><p>  Amazon has said that using its fulfillment service is voluntary for sellers. Closely guarded algorithms determine the Buy Box and search ranking on Amazon.com.</p><p>  亚马逊表示，使用其履行服务是卖家自愿的。密切保护的算法决定了Amazon.com上的“购买”框并搜索排名。 </p><p>  Amazon’s Mr. Evans said that FBA participation isn’t part of the algorithms for the Buy Box or search ranking but that speed of delivery is. Products offered through Amazon’s logistics network generally provide a better experience for customers than fulfillment through other means, he said.</p><p>亚马逊的埃文斯先生表示，FBA参与不是购买框或搜索排名的算法，但交货速度是。他说，通过亚马逊的物流网络提供的产品，通常为客户提供更好的客户体验，而不是通过其他方式提供更好的客户。</p><p>  In PopSockets’ case, its hit product—a collapsible handle that attaches to smartphones—was contending with counterfeits on Amazon, said Mr. Barnett, the CEO. For more than a year, the Boulder, Colo., company made regular complaints to Amazon about the fakes, he said. It asked for its products to be “gated” on Amazon’s site, which would require resellers of PopSockets products to be vetted for authenticity.
