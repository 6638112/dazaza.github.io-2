This was all a misunderstanding, he had thought. Parks had trouble with the law in his past, but that was behind him. Since being released from prison on drug-related charges, he had changed his life and was now working a steady job as a carpenter.</p><p> 公园，一个居住在新泽西州帕特森的31岁的黑人，他从祖母叫疯狂的电话，告诉他来自伍德布里奇的警察，30英里之外的伍德布里奇，在他们分享的公寓里寻找他。他曾想过这一切都是一种误解。公园在过去的法律上有困难，但这是在他身后。由于从监狱释放了与毒品有关的费用，他改变了他的生命，现在正在努力工作作为木匠。</p><p> Standing at the desk of the police station, holding an envelope with his Social Security card and identification, Parks was ready to clear his name. It wouldn&#39;t be so easy.</p><p> 站在派出所的桌子上，拿着一个与社会保障卡和身份证明，公园准备清楚他的名字。它不会那么容易。</p><p> &#34;Four or five minutes later as me and [the clerk] were talking, two other officers walk up and tell me to put my hands behind my back,&#34; Parks recalled in an interview with CNN Business. &#34;He&#39;s like, &#39;Put your hands behind your back. You&#39;re under arrest.&#39;&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;四或五分钟后，我和[职员]在说话，另外两名官员走路告诉我把手放在我的背后，＆＃34;公园在接受CNN业务采访时回忆起。 ＆＃34;他喜欢，＆＃39;把手放在背后。你逮捕了。＆＃39;＆＃34;</p><p>  The charges were serious: aggravated assault, unlawful possession of weapons, using a fake ID, possession of marijuana, shoplifting, leaving the scene of a crime, resisting arrest. On top of that, Parks was accused of nearly hitting a police officer with a car.</p><p>  收费严重：加重袭击，非法拥有武器，使用假身份证，拥有大麻，入店行窃，离开现场犯罪，抵抗逮捕。最重要的是，公园被指控几乎击中了一辆警察的汽车。</p><p>  Detained by the Woodbridge police, Parks, whose arrest was first reported by  NJ.com, said he spent 11 days in jail. Only upon his release was he able to learn what the evidence against him was.</p><p>  由Woodbridge警察拘留，公园，他的逮捕是由NJ.com报告的，他说他在监狱里度过了11天。只有在他的释放之上，他能够了解对他的证据是什么。</p><p> According to a police report obtained by CNN, the evidence presented by the police officers that led to Parks&#39; arrest was a &#34;high profile comparison&#34; from a  facial recognition scan of a photo from what was determined to be a fake ID left at the crime scene that witnesses connected to the suspect. The facial recognition match was enough for prosecutors and a judge to sign off on his arrest.</p><p> 根据CNN获得的一份警察报告，警官带领的证据导致停放＆＃39;逮捕是一个＆＃34;高调比较＆＃34;从一张照片的面部识别扫描从决心是在犯罪现场留下的假身份证，目睹与嫌疑人相连的罪行。面部识别比赛足以让检察官和法官签署他的逮捕。 </p><p> What followed was a year-long legal nightmare for Parks, who faced years in prison and the potential of additional time due to his prior convictions.</p><p>随后是一年长期以来的公园合法噩梦，他面临着近年的监狱和潜在的额外时间，因为他的先前定罪。</p><p>  While facial recognition technology has become increasingly accurate,  research has shown it is drastically more prone to error when trying to match the faces of darker skinned people. And because no federal guidelines exist to limit or standardize the use of facial recognition by law enforcement, states -- and, more often, municipalities -- are left to decide for themselves what, if anything, to do to control its use.  Virginia recently became the fifth state to curtail the use of the facial recognition by police, while  Portland,  San Francisco,  Oakland and Boston are among the cities outlawing it.</p><p>  虽然面部识别技术变得越来越准确，但研究表明，在试图匹配肤色的脸上的面孔时，研究表明它更容易出现错误。因为没有联邦准则限制或标准化使用执法，各国 - 以及更常见的城市 - 留下自己的使用，以便自己决定，如果有的话，可以做些什么来控制它的使用。弗吉尼亚最近成为第五次遏制警察使用面部认可的国家，而波特兰，旧金山，奥克兰和波士顿是禁止的城市之一。</p><p>  There are only a handful of known cases in which facial recognition has been used as the sole evidence in an arrest, and many police departments claim to use facial recognition for investigative leads only. However, according to some privacy advocates, the restrictions on facial recognition being presented as evidence are lax, and there is little transparency about how those matches are being used in criminal cases.</p><p>  只有少数人的已知案例，其中面部识别被用作逮捕中的唯一证据，许多警察部门索赔只要求使用面部认可的调查潜在罪。然而，根据一些隐私倡导者，对面部识别的限制被呈现为证据是宽松的，并且关于如何在刑事案件中使用这些比赛的透明度很少。</p><p> &#34;When we talk about the number of facial recognition scans unfolding in the United States every day, we don&#39;t even know the full number,&#34; said Albert Fox Cahn, executive director of Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, a nonprofit that opposes the use of facial recognition by law enforcement. &#34;You can have people who are being sent to jail wrongly who never know that facial recognition played a role in their arrest.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;当我们谈论每天在美国展开的面部识别扫描的数量时，我们甚至都知道全部号码，＆＃34;监督技术监督项目执行主任Albert Fox Cahn表示，这是一种非营利组织，反对法律执法的面部认可。 ＆＃34;你可以让那些被送往监狱的人错误地从不知道面部承认在他们的逮捕中发挥了作用。＆＃34;</p><p>  The crimes Parks had allegedly committed occurred at a Hampton Inn in Woodbridge, New Jersey on January 26, 2019. Local police responded to an alleged shoplifting incident and spoke with a suspect who gave them a Tennessee driver&#39;s license. When the officers ran the license through with dispatch, they came back with no results. It was a fake ID.</p><p>  据称犯罪园区曾致力于2019年1月26日的新泽西州伍德布里奇的汉普顿酒店。当地警方回应了一个涉嫌入店行窃事件，并与嫌疑人发言，他们给了他们田纳西州司机＆＃39;牌照。当官员通过派遣运行许可证时，他们没有结果。这是一个假身份证。</p><p> After being confronted by the police, the suspect ran out of the hotel, got into a car and sped off, according to the police report. While fleeing, he hit a concrete pillar and a police car, and almost struck an officer.</p><p> 根据警方报告，嫌疑人曾遇到过酒店，进入了一辆车并赶走了。逃离时，他击中了一个混凝土的柱子和一辆警车，几乎击中了一名军官。</p><p>   Two eyewitnesses to the crime told police that the photo on the fake Tennessee driver&#39;s license matched the person they&#39;d seen. With that, police sent the photo off for facial recognition scanning. The scan compared the Tennessee ID photo to a police database of faces and, police said, returned a &#34;high profile comparison&#34; to a picture of Nijeer Parks. To this day, Parks and his lawyer don&#39;t know what photo of him the system scanned or where it came from.</p><p>   对犯罪的两个目击者告诉警方，假田纳西州的驾驶员＆＃39;牌照与他们看过的人匹配。有了这个，警方将照片送去进行面部识别扫描。扫描将田纳西州的ID照片与警方说，返回A＆＃34;高调比较＆＃34;到了尼雅公园的照片。到这一天，公园和他的律师唐＆＃39; t知道他的系统扫描或来自哪里的照片。 </p><p> With seemingly no other evidence, according to the police report, officers in the Woodbridge Police Department, Middlesex County Assistant Prosecutor Peter Nastasi and Woodbridge Municipal Court Judge David Stahl signed off on a warrant for Parks&#39; arrest.</p><p>据警方报告称，似乎没有其他证据，伍德布里奇警察局，米德尔斯县助理检察官彼得Nastasi和Woodbridge市法院法官David Stahl签署了一个公园＆＃39的逮捕令;逮捕。</p><p>  Two years after her son was arrested, Patricia Parks stood in the kitchen of his apartment staring at an enlarged print out of the suspect&#39;s fake ID.</p><p>  她的儿子被捕后两年，Patricia Parks站在他的公寓的厨房里，盯着嫌疑人和＃39;假身份证的扩大印刷。</p><p> &#34;He looks nothing like him ... nothing like him,&#34; she said. &#34;People have a saying &#39;all Black people look the same.&#39; That&#39;s the first thing came to my mind when I&#39;d seen this photo because it looks nothing like my son.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;他看起来只像他一样......没有他，＆＃34;她说。 ＆＃34;人们有一句话＆＃39;所有黑人看起来都一样。＆＃39;那个＆＃39;当我看到这张照片时，第一件事就是我的脑海想到了我的脑海。因为它看起来不像我的儿子。＆＃34;</p><p> Nijeer  noted that the suspect appears to be wearing earrings. &#34;All you had to do was look at my ears and notice I don&#39;t even have ear piercings,&#34; he said.</p><p> Nijeer指出，嫌疑人似乎穿着耳环。 ＆＃34;你所要做的就是看看我的耳朵，并注意我甚至有耳孔，＆＃34;他说。</p><p>   At the time the crimes were being committed, Parks was at a Western Union 30 miles away from the Hampton Inn sending money to his fiancée. He happened to take a picture of the receipt&#39;s tracking number that corroborated his story. Still, it took nearly a year for the charges against him to be dropped.</p><p>   在犯罪犯罪时，公园位于西联汇款，距离汉普顿店送钱30英里，向他的未婚妻汇款。他碰巧拍了收据的照片＆＃39;追踪的追踪号码，以证实他的故事。尽管如此，对他的指控仍然需要近一年。</p><p>   &#34;I&#39;ve never heard anything from anybody else... no, &#39;We&#39;re sorry. We could have went about it a different way.&#34; said Parks. &#34;Nothing.&#34;</p><p>   ＆＃34;我从未听过任何人的任何人......没有，＆＃39;我们＆＃39;对不起。我们本可以像这样做不同的方式。＆＃34;公园说。 ＆＃34;没有。＆＃34;</p><p>  Nijeer Parks isn&#39;t the only person who&#39;s been arrested thanks to a supposed facial recognition match that wasn&#39;t. There&#39;s also  Robert Williams and Michael Oliver, two Black men arrested in Detroit based in part on bad facial recognition results. Their cases were later dropped, too. Williams, joined by the ACLU, recently filed a  federal suit against the City of Detroit.</p><p>  尼雅公园ISN＆＃39;这是唯一一名唯一的人，它被认为是被认为的面部识别符合而被逮捕的那些＆＃39; t。其中罗伯特威廉姆斯和迈克尔奥利弗罗伯特威廉姆斯和迈克尔奥利弗在底特律逮捕，部分基于面部识别结果。他们的病例后来也被掉了下来。威廉姆斯加入了ACLU，最近向底特律市提起了联邦诉讼。 </p><p> Experts say examples of facial recognition being presented as evidence to make arrests are rare. What&#39;s more common is police not mentioning to the defense that facial recognition was used at all, according to a  report by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.</p><p>专家表示，面部识别的例子被提出为逮捕的证据是罕见的。根据全国刑事辩护律师协会的一份报告，＆＃39;较常见的是警方没有提到捍卫面部认可的辩护。</p><p> A small but growing group of jurisdictions have  banned or restricted its use by law enforcement</p><p> 一个小但不断增长的司法管辖区已经禁止或限制了执法的使用</p><p>  The Woodbridge Police Department and the Middlesex Prosecutors Office did not respond to questions on whether it was still their practice to use facial recognition matches as probable cause in arrests. There do not appear to be any local, state-wide or federal regulations in place that would prevent them from doing so.</p><p>  Woodbridge警察局和Middlesex检察官办公室没有回答关于仍然是他们是否仍然使用面部识别比赛作为可能的逮捕原因的问题。似乎没有任何地方，全国或联邦法规，这将阻止他们这样做。</p><p> Some police departments, government agencies and  facial recognition vendors have cautioned that purported facial recognition matches should be used only as investigative tools, not as evidence.</p><p> 一些警察部门，政府机构和面部承认供应商提醒说，据称的面部识别比赛应仅作为调查工具使用，而不是证据。</p><p> Facial recognition &#34;remains an investigative lead only,&#34; FBI Deputy Assistant Director Kimberly Del Greco  testified to Congress in 2017. &#34;The candidates must be further reviewed by specialized face examiners and/or the relevant investigators.&#34;</p><p> 面部识别＆＃34;仍然是一个调查铅，＆＃34;联邦调查局副助理主任Kimberly del Greco于2017年作证为国会。＆＃34;候选人必须由专门的面部审查员和/或相关调查人员进一步审查。＆＃34;</p><p> Detroit&#39;s police manual stipulates that a facial recognition match is meant to be used only &#34;as an investigative lead&#34; and &#34;is not to be considered a positive identification of a subject.&#34;</p><p> 底特律＆＃39;警察手册规定，面部识别匹配仅用于仅使用＆＃34;作为调查领导＆＃34;和＃34;不是被认为是一个受试者的积极识别。＆＃34;</p><p> However, according to Clare Garvie, a senior associate with the Center on Privacy &amp; Technology at Georgetown Law, even in jurisdictions that claim to use facial recognition matches only to launch investigations, the distinction between &#34;investigative tool&#34; and &#34;evidence&#34; can be a blurry one for police to follow. The police &#34;are in no way informed ... on what constitutes sufficient additional investigative steps,&#34; Garvie said.</p><p> 但是，根据与隐私中心的高级助理和amp的高级助理Clare Garvie;乔治城法律的技术，即使在声称使用面部识别匹配的司法管辖区，只能在启动调查，＆＃34之间的区别;调查工具＆＃34;和＃34;证据＆＃34;可以成为警察的模糊的一个。警察＆＃34;没有通知......关于什么构成足够的额外调查步骤，＆＃34;加维说。 </p><p> Although we don&#39;t know for sure what the Woodbridge Police Department&#39;s policies around facial recognition are, the  New York City Police Department has an explicit policy stipulating that there must be &#34;other corroborating evidence&#34; along with facial recognition matches to allow for an arrest.</p><p>虽然我们不确定Woodbridge警察局＆＃39;纽约市警察局的政策是什么，纽约市警察局有明确的政策规定必须有和＃34;其他证据＆＃34;随着面部识别匹配，允许逮捕。</p><p> In practice, that additional investigative step could be as simple as getting a witness to say that a photo obtained from a facial recognition match looks like the suspect.</p><p> 在实践中，额外的调查步骤可以像解见证那样简单，说从面部识别匹配中获得的照片看起来像嫌疑人。</p><p> For example, according to  court filings, one NYPD officer texted a witness a photo of a single face obtained in a facial recognition search, along with the message &#34;Is this the guy...?&#34; When the witness said yes, police made the arrest.</p><p> 例如，根据法院申请，一名NYPD官员发布了一个见证在面部识别搜索中获得的单一面孔的照片，以及消息＆＃34;这是家伙......？＆＃34;当见证说是的，警方逮捕了。</p><p>  Parks is now suing those involved in his arrest for violating his civil rights and &#34;intentional infliction of emotional distress.&#34; None of the defendants listed on Parks&#39; lawsuit responded to a request for comment. In March, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case, which is still ongoing . Judge Stahl, who is not listed as a defendant, also did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>  帕克斯现在采取违反他的民权和第34次参与他的逮捕的人;故意造成情绪困扰。＆＃34;没有被告在公园和＃39上市;诉讼答复了评论请求。 3月份，被告提出了一项议案，以解雇仍在持续的案件。没有被列为被告的判断判断，也没有回复评论请求。</p><p>  &#34;You took being comfortable away from me. I see police, I&#39;m automatically shaken up,&#34; Parks told CNN. &#34;You proved to me that you can lock me up for anything, and there&#39;s nothing I can do about it.&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;你带着舒适的远离我。我看到警察，我自动摇晃，＆＃34;公园告诉CNN。 ＆＃34;你证明了我，你可以锁定我的任何东西，而且在那里我可以做任何事情。＆＃34; </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/29/tech/nijeer-parks-facial-recognition-police-arrest/index.html">https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/29/tech/nijeer-parks-facial-recognition-police-arrest/index.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/黑人/">#黑人</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/facial/">#facial</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/公园/">#公园</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
