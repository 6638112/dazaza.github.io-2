Not Home edition, mind,			but Pro. Internet access and Microsoft account will (or most likely will) be needed to finish the			system setup. And I decided, that&#39;s it, I had enough stupidity for one lifetime.</p><p>几天前，我看到一篇论坛帖子，指向一篇链接到</p><p>  This pointless cloudification of the classic PC desktop formula will never stop. It won&#39;t stop until			desktop as a service is a reality and all that nonsense. No. I&#39;m not going to cooperate with that plan.			And so I&#39;ve now finally decided that I&#39;m going to properly start moving my production workflows away			from Windows. That won&#39;t be an easy task. After all, I&#39;ve been using Windows since 1992. But I have 			 zero intention of using Windows 11, as it&#39;s pointless			in its own right, and I have even less intention of being a subscription monkey. Services yes, products			never. This article is a start of a journey whereby I plan to wean myself off Windows. Let&#39;s begin.</p><p>这种对经典PC桌面模式毫无意义的云化永远不会停止。它赢了&#39；不要等到</p><p>      First, I need to give you a bit more context, so you fully understand what I have in mind. One, I			use Windows, mostly because I need it for gaming and Office (publishers and such). Most other things			work just fine in Linux, which is my second, secondary-primary setup. Two, I use Linux extensively,			too, and the experience is rather decent. It&#39;s not perfect just yet, but things are slowly improving. A			bit too slowly. But hey. You can read more about this in my now three-year-long 			 series of articles on 			 Slimbook Pro2 laptop &amp; Kubuntu. That&#39;s going			encouragingly well.</p><p>首先，我需要给你们更多的背景知识，这样你们就能完全理解我的想法。一，我</p><p>  At the moment, my production Windows setup consists of Windows 10 Pro, plus an odd relic, which we			will ignore for the time being. Windows 10 will be supported until 2025, so there is no immediate			problem here. We have almost four full years ahead, and even then, things won&#39;t suddenly stop or become			irrelevant. After all, people still use Windows 7 and such. But there are scenarios where you should or			really must have a fully up-to-date operating system.</p><p>目前，我的生产Windows安装程序由Windows 10 Pro和一个奇怪的遗留软件组成，我们正在使用它</p><p>  To add insult to the injury, Windows 11 also has the utterly bizarre TPM requirement nonsense, which			means that 			 my beefy desktop, which has TPM disabled in BIOS, is not			compatible with Windows 11 (excellent), and will technically become &#34;useless&#34; for new editions of			Windows even if I do decide to install them. But then, when you combine all the different stupidities			being piled into Windows - Weather icon, Teams being installed without anyone asking, Rewards crap			shown in the header of the Settings menu, Edge protocol hardcoding, no easy way to disable updates or			Defender, and then some, one has to realize that there is no future for people with triple-digit IQ in			this space.</p><p>雪上加霜的是，Windows 11还有一个完全奇怪的TPM要求，这是毫无意义的</p><p>  This means I have to move away from Windows. But I want to do that in a nice, elegant, strategic			manner that doesn&#39;t leave me functionally impaired. That means slowly, carefully, methodically mapping			out all of my usecases to the finest detail, and then porting them over to Linux.</p><p>这意味着我必须离开窗户。但我想用一种优雅的策略</p><p>      The journey is still in the very early stages. But roughly, the plan is as follows. From now till			2025, I will write a series of tutorials and guides, covering every step of my migration effort,			showing you how and what I did with this or that particular usecase. For example, how to install 			 SketchUp 2017 in Linux. Check! I will also focus on games			and the office suite usage, of course, because among the many different usage scenarios, those			have always remained as outstanding gaps in the Windows-Linux parity.</p><p>这段旅程仍处于非常早期的阶段。但大致计划如下。从现在到现在</p><p>  Here&#39;s a quick list of some of the things that come to mind, for the time being:</p><p>这里&#39；下面是一个简短的列表，列出了我目前想到的一些事情：</p><p>  I will need to test the Windows builds of Kerkythea, Foxit Reader and KompoZer through				WINE.</p><p>我需要通过测试Kerkythea、Foxit Reader和KompoZer的Windows版本</p><p>  I will try to install my old copy of Office 2010 in the same manner. Or maybe buy a license for				something like the OnlyOffice desktop suite. Or I will pay professional book editors to convert my				scripts and stories. I will rather pay hundreds or thousands of dollars to people for their work				than participate in the must-online fest. This will be a conscious financial decision, and while it				won&#39;t be in my favor, the MuSt-HaVe-OnLiNe crowd will not see a dime of it. A penny or a cent, if				you prefer.</p><p>我将尝试以同样的方式安装Office 2010的旧版本。或者买一张驾驶执照</p><p>  I will keep or convert my desktop to a dual-boot setup and use Windows 10 beyond its expiration				date for gaming. Maybe it&#39;s a bit inconvenient, but 				 my favorite desktop, Plasma, has a superb save-workspace				settings, including all your programs and files, so you can resume an old session without a				hitch.</p><p>我将保留或将我的桌面转换为双启动设置，并在过期后使用Windows 10</p><p>  I will most likely buy a new Slimbook/Linux desktop workstation and make it my primary				system.</p><p>我很可能会购买一台新的Slimbook/Linux桌面工作站，并将其作为我的主要设备</p><p>        Realistically, that could happen. It is possible that there might be some corner usecase where one			must have an up-to-date Windows workflow for something, I don&#39;t know, to be able to use a government			site or fill in a government form somewhere or do online banking. This will be a difficult scenario to			solve. I have no easy answers for that just yet.</p><p>事实上，这是可能发生的。有可能存在某个角落的用例</p><p>  If that happens, at the moment, given the technology and solutions available, the way I imagine			it:</p><p>如果发生这种情况，在目前，考虑到可用的技术和解决方案，就像我想象的那样</p><p>  If not, create a dual-boot setup, and then purge and delete the online account manually from				Linux.</p><p>如果没有，请创建双启动设置，然后从中手动清除并删除联机帐户</p><p>  At some distant point in the future, even this may not be a feasible scenario. Perhaps if Windows			goes subscription-only. Again, I have no easy answer for how to resolve this. But I will leave this			battle for when it becomes relevant. At the moment, my focus will be on moving my CURRENT Windows setup			to an equivalent Linux setup. That&#39;s my plan for 2025.</p><p>在未来的某个遥远的时刻，即使这样也可能不可行。也许如果窗户</p><p>  Timewise, even beyond 2025, Windows 10 will remain relevant for quite a way while, the same way			Windows 7 is today. At the very least, this is because the LTSC version of Windows 10 will be around			for another 5-6 years thereafter, and that means the software that runs on Windows 10 will remain			available and supported. Especially if the pointless TPM requirement suddenly renders a huge, huge			swath of Windows machines un-upgradable.</p><p>就时间而言，即使在2025年以后，Windows 10仍将在相当长的一段时间内保持相关性，而同样的方式</p><p>    Yes. You may also have read about the &#34;security chip&#34; Pluton thingie. Trusted computing and all			that. It is also something that could (emphasis on could, pure speculation for now) block other			operating systems from running on the machine. Theoretically, you may end up with hardware that is			locked to specific operating systems and/or doesn&#39;t support certain features in the BIOS, which may			preclude Linux from being used on these machines. That could be a difficult scenario, too. In a way,			this is not that different from what you have today with Secure Boot.</p><p>对你可能也读过&#34；安全芯片&#34；深成岩体。可信计算和所有</p><p>  But. This hasn&#39;t happened, and it hasn&#39;t happened since 2004 or so, roughly when the concept of			Trusted computing started making headlines in the tech journalism. Since, Microsoft and various other			companies have tried to implement &#34;enhanced&#34; security features on the hardware and BIOS level, and for			the most part, it didn&#39;t really make any big difference. For the most part, you can disable Secure			Boot, and a variety of Linux distributions supports it (Secure Boot) nonetheless. I have personally not			encountered any system that prevents you from turning Secure Off in the BIOS menu.</p><p>但是这还没有&#39；没有发生，而且还没有&#39；2004年左右，大约在</p><p>    Again, this is most likely to happen, using my prophetic skills, at least 5-10 years off. Like the			must-use Windows scenario outlined earlier, that is a battle for after this current challenge I have.			Peace and quiet until 2025, slow preparation for the cutoff. By then, I&#39;d like to hope that Steam &amp;			Linux becomes a given, and I can put the whole corporate greed hysteria behind me. It&#39;s not a fun thing			thinking about this problem, but ignoring it will not make the stupidity go away. You must face it,			embrace it, and then fend it off.</p><p>用我的预言能力来看，至少5-10年后，这很可能再次发生。就像</p><p>    The world changes. The world is changing. It&#39;s inevitable. And normal. But that does not mean every			change is good, or that one should accept stupid or pointless things with a grin on their face. Nope. I			am aware that the young generations are more accustomed and more accepting of the online-always			account-everywhere computing, especially on their smartphones. But my desktop is not a phone, and I&#39;m			not willing to play stupid games of marketing greed and silly touch ideas on something that has &#34;Pro&#34;			in its label. If I pay money for a supposedly top-tier product, I want to be left alone, and I don&#39;t			want any of the modern crap.</p><p>世界变了。世界正在改变。它&#39；这是不可避免的。而且很正常。但这并不意味着每一次</p><p>  There will come a point in the future when the computing model changes for good. In 15-20 years, no			one will talk about the &#34;offline&#34; and &#34;local&#34; and such stuff. That will be the reign of dinosaurs, and			the young people will of course ignore us, the same way &#34;we&#34; ignore people when they talk about radio			or cable TV or any old idea that feels silly and cumbersome today. You can&#39;t win that battle. But			there&#39;s one battle you can win. And that&#39;s where you put your hard-earned money. I for sure will not be			giving money for a touchfest-inspired version of a classic desktop operating system. Call it &#34;Low-IQ&#34;			edition, I might consider it. Call it &#34;Pro&#34;, I don&#39;t want any of the nonsense. Simple.</p><p>在未来的某个时刻，计算模式将永远改变。15-20年后，不会</p><p>  In 15-20 years, I intend to be on a small island somewhere, open a bakery or some other post-IT			detox syndrome business that people do once they get fed up with chewing on the sour end of the			corporate stick. By then, I hope my biggest concerns will be the weather for the day and who I invite			to my BBQ. And I hope to go online only when I need to shoot or race some friends in a game, or to			check email once a week because that&#39;s what you do when you live on a small island somewhere.</p><p>15-20年后，我打算在某个小岛上，开一家面包店或其他便利店</p><p>  Until then, I still must wrestle with occasional stupidity. I have already stated that I have no			intention of using Windows 11, and the additional constraint on the Pro version seals the deal for			good. I hope you find this little rant entertaining. The really interesting bits will be the follow up			articles, over the next months and years, in which I will painstaking detail my migration experiences			and hurdles. Hopefully, everything will work, but even if not, I&#39;ll do my best to solve the problems			that arise. It took me five years to get SketchUp working again in Linux, and if it takes me another			five to sort out a dozen other issues, so be it. But I will not give up.</p><p>在那之前，我仍然必须与偶尔的愚蠢作斗争。我已经说过我没有</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/可能/">#可能</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
