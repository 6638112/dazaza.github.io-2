For others, it starts with the memes. The price of lumber has soared over the past year, and it’s an incredibly hot commodity. The internet has taken notice.</p><p>对于一些人来说，进入美国的木材紧缩的旅程从决定建造一个新的家庭，或在家庭仓库，大流行驱动的家庭改造热潮有助于使基本材料昂贵，难以进入。对于别人来说，它从模因开始。在过去的一年里，木材价格飙升，这是一个令人难以置信的热门商品。互联网通知了。</p><p> “Not even one police escort,” on person on Twitter  quipped alongside a photo of a truck stacked with lumber rolling down the highway. Another  snapped a picture of a pile of boards in a building, remarking, “Wow, neighbors just casually flaunting their wealth in the hallway.”</p><p> “甚至没有一名警察护送，”在Twitter上剥夺了一张卡车的照片，堆放着用木材滚落的卡车的照片。另一个拍了一堆牌照在建筑物中的照片，评论，“哇，邻居只是随便炫耀他们在走廊里的财富。”</p><p>  While the memes are a joke, the situation is real: Demand for lumber has exploded in recent months, and suppliers have struggled to keep up. Much of the industry has been on its heels since the Great Recession, and it slowed down production accordingly. Those sawmill closures and such aren’t easy to reverse, even if someone might have predicted things would pick up now.</p><p>  虽然模因是一个笑话，但情况是真实的：最近几个月的对木材的需求已经爆炸，供应商努力跟上。自经济衰退以来，这位大部分行业都在其脚跟上，并相应地减缓了生产。即使有人可能已经预测，那些锯木厂闭包并不易逆转。</p><p> Prices have, in turn, skyrocketed. For years, the price of 1,000 board feet of lumber has generally traded in the $200 to $400 range. It’s now well above $1,000. (One board foot is 12x12x1 inches, and the average new single-family home takes about 16,000 board feet of lumber to construct.) A new house that would have cost $10,000 in wood to get off the ground a couple of years ago now costs $40,000 worth of wood — assuming, that is, you can even get your hands on the lumber.</p><p> 反过来，价格又飙升。多年来，1,000杆木材脚的价格一般以200美元到400美元的范围交易。它现在高于1000美元。 （一个栏脚是12x12x1英寸，平均新的单户住宅需要大约16,000个木板的木材。）几年前，在木头下车的新房子现在占上难，现在需要40,000美元值得的木材 - 假设，即，你甚至可以让你的手放在木材上。</p><p>  Most people in the sector expected that Covid-19 would induce an industry-wide slowdown, not an industry-wide boom. Many were caught flat-footed.</p><p>  该部门的大多数人都预计Covid-19将引起行业范围的放缓，而不是一个行业范围的繁荣。许多人被抓住了平息。</p><p> “Not only has it surprised me, it’s just surprised the whole industry, how quickly we came roaring back. Housing and construction, repair and remodel, that’s where so much money was pointed by American consumers that the sheer scale of demand was hard to fathom,” Stinson Dean, CEO of Deacon Lumber, a lumber trading company based in Missouri, told me.</p><p> “它不仅让我感到惊讶，而且整个行业只是惊讶，我们咆哮着迅速。住房和建筑，修复和改造，这就是美国消费者所指出的那么多钱，即在密苏里州的木材贸易公司的Deacon Lumber的首席执行官STINSON Dean Stinson Dean Stinson Dean告诉我。</p><p> In the middle of our call, he had to pause to make a sale. “I’m so sorry, everyone needs lumber, and I have it,” he said after putting me on hold. He explained it probably would have been cheaper for his client, in Texas, to buy the truckload of lumber he just sold them directly from a producer up in Canada, but that producer is sold out through May, and they needed the materials ASAP. “You can’t get anything prompt, and a lot of folks have just underestimated their inventory needs, so they need to lean on folks like me.”</p><p> 在我们的电话中间，他不得不停下来销售。 “我很抱歉，每个人都需要木材，我有它，”他在让我暂停后说道。他解释说它可能会对他的客户更便宜，在德克萨斯州购买木材的卡车，他刚从加拿大的生产者直接卖掉了，但该制片人通过5月售罄，他们尽快售罄。 “你无法得到任何提示，很多人刚刚低估了他们的库存需求，所以他们需要依靠像我这样的人。” </p><p> The lumber frenzy is part of a string of unexpected and strange developments in the Covid-19 economy. Before there was the great run on wood of 2021,  there was the great run on toilet paper of 2020. The same lockdown boredom and extra cash that inspired  some people to get into day trading animated people to decide it was time to fix up their homes. Those who fled cities decided not only to  buy existing homes but also to build new ones.</p><p>木材狂热是Covid-19经济体中一系列意外和奇怪的发展的一部分。在2021年的木头上有大跑的伟大跑步之前，在2020年的卫生纸上有很好的跑步。相同的锁定无聊和额外的现金，激发了一些人进入日常交易动画的人来决定是时候修理他们的房屋了。那些逃离城市的人不仅决定购买现有的房屋，还决定建立新的家园。</p><p> In recent days, I spoke with a dozen people across the lumber industry about the economics of the current craze and why lumber is so expensive and so hard to come by. Many were bemused that anyone was even interested. Panels and two-by-fours and studs are not usually the stuff of public intrigue.</p><p> 最近几天，我用十几个人对木材行业的交谈有关当前热潮的经济学，以及为什么木材是如此昂贵，难以通过。许多人被愚蠢地愚蠢地兴趣。面板和二章和铆钉通常不是公共阴谋的东西。</p><p> “I honestly don’t know what to make of it,” said Chace Barber, a Canadian logger and truck driver who’s become a bit of a lumberjack  TikTok star in recent months, of his newfound internet following. “I guess I’ve been trying to explain as much about logging as I can.” It wasn’t a given that the TikTok crowd would be particularly into his line of work, but the memeification of lumber has certainly helped — not to mention that the 32-year-old Barber is quite attractive. (Though he says he doesn’t get as many DMs as you’d think.)</p><p> “老实说，我肯定不知道该制作什么，”Chace Barber，一名加拿大登录器和卡车司机近几个月的洛姆伯里奇蒂克特恒星，他的新发现互联网追随着。 “我想我一直试图向伐木那么多解释。”这不是一个鉴于Tiktok人群将特别是他的工作线，但木材的忆取肯定有助于 - 更不用说32岁的理发师非常有吸引力。 （虽然他说他没有像你想象的那样多的DMS。）</p><p> Barber isn’t the only one who’s puzzled — at the cultural interest, and also the broader situation. Beyond a  2018 blip, the lumber industry hasn’t exactly been thriving lately. “Everybody’s hot and heavy about this business we’re in, and to us, it’s kind of funny, because this is a generational run,” said Chip Setzer, director of trading and growth at Mickey, a commodities trading platform. “I would venture to guess there’s nobody alive that has ever seen what we’re going through right now.”</p><p> 理发师不是唯一一个困惑的人 - 在文化兴趣，以及更广泛的情况。超越2018年，木材行业最近并没有完全蓬勃发展。 “每个人都对这一业务的热烈而沉重，我们在我们身上，这是一个有趣的，因为这是一个代理运行，”米奇商品交易平台的交易和增长总监芯片赛车说。 “我会冒险猜测现在没有见过我们现在正在经历的东西。”</p><p>    Before we get further into the lumber industry crunch, it’s probably a good idea to explain how the flow of material usually goes: Someone cuts down a log in the forest, it gets put in a truck, and goes to a sawmill or panel mill to be processed into a finished product — a stick of lumber, a sheet of plywood or OSB (oriented strand board), etc. That then goes out into the world to be sold.</p><p>    在我们进一步进入木材行业紧缩之前，解释材料的流动通常是如何发展的好主意：有人在森林里砍伐了一辆登录，它放在卡车上，然后进入锯木厂或面板磨机被加工成成品 - 木材棒，一张胶合板或OSB（面向股线）等，然后进入世界上销售。</p><p> Timber and lumber refer to different things: Timber is the raw fiber from the forest, the tree; lumber is a manufactured finished good, like what you’d buy at the hardware store to fix your fence. You can sort of think of the chain like the oil industry. The unprocessed oil is the log, the refinery is the sawmill, and gas is the lumber — the product everyone’s talking about now.</p><p> 木材和木材参考不同的东西：木材是森林的原料纤维，树;木材是一个制造成品的好，就像你在五金店买的东西来修复你的围栏。您可以对石油工业等连锁进行思考。未加工的油是日志，炼油厂是锯木厂，天然气是木材 - 每个人都在谈论的产品。</p><p> To a certain extent, the story of that lumber mania is a pretty straightforward one of supply and demand: People want more wood than there is to go around.</p><p> 在一定程度上，那个木材狂热的故事是一个非常简单的供需之一：人们想要更多的木头，而不是四处走动。 </p><p> “Housing and construction, repair and remodel, that’s where so much money was pointed by American consumers that the sheer scale of demand was hard to fathom”</p><p>“住房和建筑，修理和改造，这就是美国消费者所指出的那么多的钱，纯粹的需求规模难以理解”</p><p> And while there are places where the supply of timber is tight, there are others where it’s not at all. What’s vexing people trying to build a deck isn’t really a shortage of trees to be cut down, it’s more a shortage of the processed wood you can actually use — the lumber.</p><p> 虽然有木材供应紧张的地方，但还有其他人根本没有。试图建造甲板的烦恼人们并不是削减树木的短缺，它更短缺了你可以实际使用的加工木材 - 木材。</p><p> When the pandemic hit in the spring of 2020, many people in the lumber industry assumed business was about to go sour. Millions of people were out of work, businesses across the country were shuttered, and the country was in a recession. And so, producers reacted accordingly.</p><p> 当大流行于2020年春天袭击时，木材工业中的许多人都假定业务即将酸味。全国各地的企业倒闭了数百万​​人失业，该国陷入衰退。因此，生产者相应地反应。</p><p> “They really dialed back, thinking that demand would fall, and the reality is that demand never slowed,” said Dustin Jalbert, senior economist and lumber industry specialist at Fastmarkets RISI.</p><p> “他们真的拨回了，认为需求会下降，现实是需求从未放缓，”Fastimars Risi的高级经济学家和木材行业专家说。</p><p> Instead, things sped up. People stuck at home because of Covid-19 shutdowns across the country decided it was a good time to take on home improvement projects repairing and remodeling their homes — they put up fences, added on decks, built out offices, refinished basements. The DIY trend helped drive stellar sales numbers at stores such as  Home Depot and  Lowe’s.</p><p> 相反，事情加快了。由于Covid-19遍布全国内部的人们认为这是一个很好的时代，采取家居改善的项目修复和改造他们的房屋 - 他们戴上栅栏，在甲板上添加，建造办公室，改良地下室。 DIY趋势有助于推动家庭仓库和洛厄斯等商店的恒星销售数字。</p><p> Many of those who weren’t busy fixing up their homes  went looking for new ones. And where they couldn’t find preexisting homes, they started to build. Whatever initial slowdown there may have been in construction pretty quickly subsided. “Us being capitalist America, if people want to buy a house because they want to move out of the city and move to the suburbs, someone will build it for them. They’ll figure out a way,” said Michael Wisnefski, CEO of MaterialsXchange, an online marketplace for lumber and plywood.</p><p> 许多不忙着修理他们的房子的人都在寻找新的。他们找不到预先存在的家园，他们开始建立。无论初步放缓，都可能迅速施工。 “我们是资本主义美国，如果人们想买房子，因为他们想搬出城市并搬到郊区，有人会为他们建造它。他们会弄清楚一条路，“MaterialXchange的首席执行官Michael Wisnefski说，木材和胶合板的在线市场。</p><p> Residential housing starts — a metric of when new construction projects start —  have consistently climbed,  hitting rates not seen since before the Great Recession. The hot housing market helped heat up the lumber market, and in turn, that’s made new housing prices higher.</p><p> 住宅始于新的建筑项目开始 - 一直攀登，从衰退巨大衰退之前持续攀爬。热门住房市场有助于加热木材市场，而且反过来，这使得新的住房价格更高。 </p><p> “It’s adding about $36,000 to the price of a typical newly built home and almost $13,000 to a typical apartment,” said Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders.</p><p>“典型新建家庭的价格和典型的公寓近13,000美元的价格增加了大约36,000美元，”国家家庭建设者协会首席经济学家Robert Dietz表示。</p><p>   It’s worth noting that demand isn’t just surging in North America; it’s also up overseas, which further strains the industry.</p><p>   值得注意的是，需求不只是在北美飙升;它也在海外，这进一步追赶行业。</p><p>  The lumber industry has struggled to recover in the wake of the Great Recession and housing bubble, and a series of  economic,  regulatory, and  environmental issues have weighed it down. In the US and Canada, many sawmills closed up shop altogether or otherwise adjusted operations downward;  2019 was a bad year for lumber in particular.</p><p>  木材行业在巨大经济衰退和房地产泡沫之后，努力恢复，以及一系列经济，监管和环境问题将其称为下降。在美国和加拿大，许多锯木厂完全关闭商店或以其他方式调整的操作向下; 2019年是尤其是木材的糟糕的一年。</p><p> “You can’t have 12 recessionary years in an industry and not have that industry adjust how it behaves,” said Paul Jannke, principal at Forest Economic Advisors.</p><p> “你不能在一个行业中拥有12年，而且没有这种行业调整它的行为方式，”森林经济顾问的校长Paul Jannke表示。</p><p> In the spring of 2020, in preparation for even worse business, a lot of wholesalers sold off inventory and dialed down operations. As it became increasingly clear that the pandemic might not be such a disaster for the sector after all, it took the industry a while to believe it would last. “They didn’t actually start production up right away, and by the time they figured out this was actually real and it was going to last, they ran into issues with quarantining their employees, so they weren’t able to ramp up production,” Jannke said.</p><p> 在2020年春天，为更糟糕的业务准备，很多批发商销售库存并拨打了操作。由于越来越明显，大流行毕竟这一部门可能对该行业造成这么灾难，因此它占据了行业一段时间，相信它会持续的。 “他们实际上并没有立即开始生产，当时他们弄清楚这实际上是真实的，它将持续下去，他们遇到了隔离员工的问题，所以他们无法加速生产， “Jannke说。</p><p> Finding lumber workers was challenging pre-Covid-19; during the pandemic, it’s been even harder. Sawmills have had a hard time staffing up and adding shifts, not only because of Covid-related restrictions and safety measures but also because a lot of people don’t want to work those types of jobs. Some people I  spoke with suggested expanded unemployment insurance, which adds an extra $300 a week onto state benefits until September 6, may also be a factor — though, of course, sawmills are making so much money now they might be able to afford to pay workers more and court them back.</p><p> 寻找木材工人面临着挑战性的预科卫生生19;在大流行期间，它更加困难。 Sawmills已经努力工作了员工，并增加了班次，不仅因为与Covid相关的限制和安全措施，而且因为很多人不想工作这些类型的工作。有些人用建议的讲话扩大了失业保险，该保险将每周增加300美元到国家福利，直到9月6日，也可能是一个因素 - 但当然，锯木厂现在正在赚取这么多的钱，他们现在可能会负担得起这么多钱工人更多，并将他们回来。</p><p> “You can’t have 12 recessionary years in an industry and not have that industry adjust how it behaves”</p><p> “你不能在一个行业中拥有12年，而不是那个行业调整它的行为方式” </p><p> Steve Swanson, who runs one sawmill and two plywood mills in Oregon, is among those who have worked to keep up with the current demand. “At these price levels, we’re doing very, very well,” he said. “We suffered dramatically over the last decade, and now we’re getting rewarded for having the tenacity to stay in business.”</p><p>在俄勒冈州经营一个锯木厂和两个胶合板厂的史蒂夫斯旺森是那些工作以跟上当前需求的人。 “在这些价格水平上，我们做得非常好，”他说。 “在过去十年中，我们遭到巨大遭受了巨大的痛苦，现在我们得到了持久性持久的荣获。”</p><p> Still, things could be better. Since 2007, he sold off one sawmill and completely shut down two others; he employs about 700 workers now, but with those jettisoned operations, he estimates he’d have employed 500 more. He notes that many people just don’t understand how hard it is to get a sawmill up and running. “They’d like to see our industry respond to these prices and make new lumber, but a new sawmill today is $100 million, it takes two years to build, and there’s no guarantee you’re going to have the raw materials to run it.” Plus, who knows how long this current surge will last.</p><p> 尽管如此，事情可能会更好。自2007年以来，他卖掉了一个锯木厂并完全关闭了其他两个;他现在雇佣了大约700名工人，但随着这些被抛弃的业务，他估计他已经雇用了500次。他指出，很多人只是不明白，让锯木厂跑步和跑步是多么努力。 “他们希望看到我们的行业回应这些价格并制作新的木材，但今天新的锯木厂是1亿美元，需要两年时间才能建立两年，并且没有保证你将拥有原材料来运行它。“另外，谁知道当前浪涌将持续多久。</p><p> The lumber supply chain, up and down, is tight, from the trucks and railcars moving materials from point A to point B, to workers to staff the lumber yards and sawmills, to, of course, the logs themselves. You can’t grow a tree overnight, or get it to the sawmill to turn it into lumber. And once you cut a tree down, it takes years to grow it back.</p><p> 木材供应链，上下，是紧的，从卡车和轨道车移动材料从一个点到指向b，向工人员工员工员工，当然，当然是原木本身。你不能在一夜之间种树，或者将它带到锯木厂转向木材。一旦你砍掉树下，就需要数年时间来恢复。</p><p> In the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia, where many of the logs come from, the “timber baskets,” or how much wood is available to cut,  are fairly constrained, Jalbert explained. About 30 percent of US lumber consumption is from Canada, and a lot of it is from British Columbia, and they’ve been dealing with a multi-decade beetle infestation  that’s hurt the supply. Wildfires pose a threat to logging in those areas, and there’s an  ongoing battle between conservationists and loggers in the Pacific Northwest, where logging on federal lands is restricted.</p><p> 在太平洋西北和不列颠哥伦比亚省，其中许多日志来自，“木材篮子”，或者木材可供削减多少木材，是相当受到约束的，贾伯特解释说。大约30％的美国木材消费来自加拿大，很多来自不列颠哥伦比亚省，他们一直在处理伤害供应的多十年甲虫侵扰。野火对这些地区的登录构成了威胁，并且在太平洋西北地区的保护主义者和伐木工人之间存在持续的争斗，在那里禁止联邦土地的登录受到限制。</p><p> On the other hand, in the US South, another area abundant with timber, the problem is sort of the opposite. “They have a glut of timber,” Jalbert said. Until the region has enough sawmill capacity to turn that timber into lumber, however, production will remain slower than it could be.</p><p> 另一方面，在美国南方，另一个区域与木材丰富，问题是一种对面。 “他们有一个木材，”贾伯特说。直到该地区有足够的锯木厂的能力将木材变成木材，而且生产率仍然慢。</p><p> “We’re finding that we have a huge inventory of trees ready to be harvested. There’s this increased demand on the lumber side of things with the same production capacity ... but the production side has all they need as far as the logs to produce lumber,” said Dan Hockenberger, the owner of Virginia Forest Resources, a timber company.</p><p> “我们发现我们有一个巨大的树木库存准备被收获。具有相同生产能力的木材方面的需求增加了......但是生产方面的所有东西都需要像日志生产木材，“弗吉尼亚州森林资源的所有者，弗吉尼亚州森林资源，一家木材公司丹波伯格说。</p><p> And even if it were to ramp up, softwood lumber from the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia isn’t necessarily interchangeable with what’s being produced in the South, said Dean, the lumber trader. “The lumber that is produced from a Southern yellow pine tree does not have the same use cases as lumber that’s produced from a Canadian spruce tree,” he said. But out of necessity, many builders are figuring out how to adjust and use more of what’s available.</p><p> 即使它是升起的，来自太平洋西北和不列颠哥伦比亚省的软木木材也不一定与南方的南部在南方制造的内容中的互换，这是木材交易商。 “由南部黄松树生产的木材没有与从加拿大云杉树生产的木材相同的用例，”他说。但是，许多建设者都在弄清楚如何调整和使用更多可用的东西。 </p><p> This disconnect between raw materials and processing capacity means that the wealth of the lumber boom  isn’t really being shared up and down the supply chain, and  many of the people growing trees are being left out. Timber prices in many places have remained stagnant, especially when you account for taxes and inflation. “We are swimming in wood in the South,” said Brooks Mendell, chief executive of forest supply researcher Forisk Consulting. “The sawmills can just buy what’s out there, there’s so much available. We have an imbalance.”</p><p>这种在原材料和加工能力之间的断开意味着木材繁荣的财富并没有真正分享供应链，并且许多生长树木的人都被遗漏了。在许多地方的木材价格仍然停滞不前，特别是当您征收税收和通货膨胀时。 “我们在南方的木材中游泳，”森林供应研究人员首席执行官Frooks Mendell表示，咨询咨询。 “锯木厂可以只买到那里，有很多可用。我们有一个不平衡。“</p><p> For his part, Barber, in Canada, isn’t seeing much of a bump in his paycheck. “The price of lumber has gone way up, the mill’s making a lot more money, but they’re not paying us any more,” he said. “It’s funny how that works.”</p><p> 在加拿大的，在他的部门，理发店没有看到他的薪水中的大部分凹凸。 “木材的价格走了起来，磨坊的钱更多，但他们不再支付我们，”他说。 “这有趣的是如何工作。”</p><p>  The surge in demand and dearth of supply in lumber are causing all sorts of volatility and distortions in the market. The lumber futures market  keeps hitting new highs, surpassing $1,400 per 1,000 board feet, and  things might be about to get even wilder. The cash market — meaning the actual physical product — is booming.  Some sawmills are selling boards before they’re even cut. Those in search of lumber are paying a high price to get it, if they can get their hands on it at all.</p><p>  木材供应量和供应的缺乏浪潮导致市场上的各种波动和扭曲。木材期货市场保持迎接新的高位，超过每1000个董事会的1,400美元，事情可能会甚至更加令人讨厌。现金市场 - 意味着实际的物理产品 - 正在蓬勃发展。一些锯木厂在他们甚至削减之前销售了董事会。那些寻找木材的人正在支付高价格来获得它，如果他们能够掌握它。</p><p>  “I have customers in foreign markets that are like, ‘I will wire transfer you $1 million right now, can you just get me some product?’ And no, I can’t,” Setzer, the commodities trader, said. He described having to place countless calls to truckers just to get something moved, and said he tells members of his team to sometimes pad their numbers on quotes to buyers because prices are moving so quickly that “you’re going to end up taking a loss on stuff if you quote it cheaply.”</p><p>  “我有像国外市场的客户一样，”我现在将推动你100万美元，你可以给我一些产品吗？“而且，商品贸易商的塞雷尔说，我不能，”索尔塞尔说。他描述了必须将无数电话放置到卡车司机只是为了得到一些移动的东西，并表示他告诉他的团队成员有时会在报价上填充他们的数字，因为价格正在迅速移动，“你将最终造成损失如果你廉价地引用它，那么就会。“</p><p> Lumber futures contracts as far out as November  remain above $1,000, suggesting things might not settle down anytime soon. While the music’s going, producers are going to keep on dancing — and, if they can manage, dancing faster.</p><p> 当地的木材期货合约仍然是11月高于1000美元，建议事情可能不会很快安定下来。虽然音乐的速度，生产者将继续跳舞 - 并且如果他们可以管理，跳舞更快。</p><p> “We simply respond to the higher prices,” Swanson said. “Why would I sell lumber at $800 per 1,000 board feet when others are offering me $1,500? It’s a commodity not any different than oil and gas and corn and orange juice — when there’s not enough of it to go around, the price goes up.”</p><p> “我们只是回应了更高的价格，”斯旺森说。 “当其他人提供1,500美元时，为什么我为每1000杆脚卖800美元的木材？这是一种不同于石油和天然气和玉米和橙汁的商品 - 当没有足够的东西来解决时，价格上涨。“</p><p> There’s consensus that the lumber mania will slow down at some point. Eventually, prices will settle back down and sawmills will catch up. But nobody is quite sure when. The spring and summer building season is upon us, and if demand didn’t slow down this past winter, it’s not going to right now. If there is a slowdown in the coming winter, combined with strong production in the mills, that may allow the chain to get back into equilibrium. By and large, everything settling down and the supply chain getting in order is going to take time.</p><p> 达人的达成共识，即木材狂热将在某些时候慢下来。最终，价格将恢复下来，锯木厂将赶上。但没有人肯定。春夏建筑季节在我们身上，如果在过去的冬天的需求并没有减慢，它现在不去。如果即将到来的冬季出现放缓，请联合轧机的强大生产，这可能使链条恢复均衡。 BY ANDLY，一切安置，供应链条按顺序进入。 </p><p> “In forestry, this sort of rebalancing takes time. The trees take a long time to grow, and it takes years to build a new mill,” Mendell said.</p><p>“在林业中，这种重新平衡需要时间。孟德尔说，树木花了很长时间才能成长，需要数年的新磨机。</p><p> While some people have pointed to lumber prices as a sign of increasing  inflation and a sign that the economy is overheating, there’s really not much that, say, the Federal Reserve can do about it. Increasing the federal interest rate, for instance, might discourage people from building homes, but it might also deter lumber producers from making the investments to up their sawmill capacity.</p><p> 虽然有些人指出了木材价格作为增加通货膨胀的迹象，但经济过热的标志，但是，如果美联储可以做到这一点。例如，增加联邦利率可能会阻止人们建立房屋，但它也可能阻止木材生产商使投资占据锯木厂的能力。</p><p> “If we’ve got supply-side constraints, the best way to battle supply-side constraints is more supply,” Dietz said. “We need more sawmills, and that takes capital.”</p><p> “如果我们有供应方限制，那么反战侧限制的最佳方式是供应更多，”Dietz说。 “我们需要更多的Sawmills，并取得资金。”</p><p> Duties on Canadian lumber, currently at 9 percent,  may have driven up prices in the past, but that’s not really what’s going on right now either. Given how much prices have skyrocketed, that 9 percent is pretty negligible.</p><p> 目前均为9％的加拿大木材的职责可能已经推动了过去的价格，但现在也不是真正的事情。鉴于飙升的价格飙升，9％的价格是可忽略不计的。</p><p> Dean said he doesn’t expect to get back to pre-Covid-19 lumber pricing, but he does think the situation will moderate. “People are only paying these high prices because they have to, and eventually those people who have to buy lumber will buy enough and we’ll be able to breathe and prices will reset. To me, the question is, where will we reset?” he said.</p><p> 迪恩说，他不指望回到Covid-19木材定价，但他认为情况会温和。 “人们只支付这些高价格，因为他们必须，最终那些必须购买木材的人会足够买，我们将能够呼吸和价格将重置。对我来说，问题是，我们将在哪里重置？“他说。</p><p> To be sure, one nagging question is why soaring prices and scarce lumber haven’t caused a slowdown already. You might think that if it’s so hard and expensive to build out your deck right now, you might wait until next year. But thus far, that’s not what’s happening.</p><p> 要确定，一个唠叨的问题是为什么飙升和稀缺木材没有引起放缓。您可能会认为如果它如此艰难而且昂贵，现在可以在明年等到达。但到目前为止，那不是发生的事情。</p><p> The situation has also sprouted conspiracy theories that there isn’t a shortage at all — you don’t have to dig very far into the internet to  find theories that there’s a plethora of lumber out there and that the lumberyards, mill owners, and other powers-that-be of the forest are just hiding it. The experts I asked about the conspiracy theories laughed them off.</p><p> 这种情况也有发芽的阴谋理论，根本没有短缺 - 你不必挖掘互联网，找到有一个夸张的木材，伐木工人，磨坊主和其他人州的权力只是掩饰它。专家我询问阴谋理论笑了。 </p><p> “They’re not hiding the boards, they’ve got nothing. They’re going to sell every board they can at these prices,” Mendell said.</p><p>“他们没有隐藏董事会，他们没有。 “他们打算以这些价格出售每个董事会，”Mendell说。</p><p>  Dean also pointed out that what looks like a lot of lumber to a regular person is not actually a lot of lumber, despite what the truthers out there might believe. Again, it takes thousands of board feet of lumber to construct your typical single-family house. “A lot of the lumber you see is already sold, it’s already committed, so it’s not available for sale on the open market.”</p><p>  迪恩还指出，对于普通人来说，普通人的看法并不是很多木材，尽管有可能相信的判守。再次，需要成千上万的木材脚来构建典型的单户家庭。 “你看到的很多木材已经售出，它已经承诺，所以它无法在开放市场上出售。”</p><p> “That conspiracy is crazy,” Barber said. “If you just see the trucks go in and out, you can see the lumber cycling.”</p><p> “阴谋是疯狂的，”巴伯说。 “如果你只是看到卡车进出，你可以看到木材骑自行车。”</p><p> Hockenberger, the timber company owner, initially thought that I might be a lumber truther reaching out to him to talk conspiracies. “Nowadays when somebody wants to talk to you about the topic, you don’t really know what their intent is with that information,” he said.</p><p> Hokenberger，Timber公司主人最初认为我可能是一个伸向他的木材经车，以谈谈阴谋。 “现在有人想跟你谈论这个话题，你真的不知道他们的意图是什么，”他说。</p><p>  The finance industry has birthed a number of memes in recent months — you’ve got the meme stocks like  GameStop, the Fed-dedicated “ Money Printer Go Brrr,” and  Dogecoin, for example. And now, you can add lumber to this list.</p><p>  最近几个月的金融业已经诞生了一些MEMES  - 您可以获得像Gamestop这样的MEME股，例如Fed专用的“Money Printer Go Brrr，”和DogeCoin。现在，您可以将木材添加到此列表中。</p><p> Reporting for this story, I discovered that lumber Twitter is definitely a thing — and figures such as Dean ( @LumberTrading) and Jalbert ( @2x4caster) are among the stars of it. Some of the discussion is serious, and a lot of it is jokes. Snap a picture of some wood, toss off a one-liner about how much money it’s worth, and you’ve struck meme gold.</p><p> 报告这个故事，我发现了木材Twitter绝对是一个事情 - 迪恩（@lumbertrading）和jalbert（@ 2x4caster）等数字是它的。一些讨论是严肃的，很多笑话是笑话。拍摄一些木头的照片，折掉一个衬里，有多少钱值，你已经击中了MEME GOLD。</p><p> took my inheritance to the dump this morning.

People that do commit to it, I think they see pretty quickly that this isn’t going to be a get-rich-quick type thing,” he said.</p><p> 一个威斯康星州咨询林斯特要求留下匿名为他的客户保密，他认为他在寻求进入种植木材的人们的人们中看到更多的兴趣：他在跳进来之前几乎就思考它。“他们认为它很酷或这是下一个比特币，但后来他们也必须意识到这很大，足够复杂，他们将要承诺它。那些犯了致力的人，我认为他们很快看到了这一点不会是一个富有的快速类型的东西，“他说。</p><p>  Barber got into TikTok less than a year ago after some of his coworkers told him to give it a try. “I notice truckers do really well on TikTok, and my only theory is we have a lot of time during the day to sit and think about things,” he said.
