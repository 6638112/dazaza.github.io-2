He wanted a city that was smaller and cheaper, big enough that he could find a decent restaurant but not so much that its problems felt unsolvable and every little task like an odyssey. After the pandemic hit and he and his wife went through a grand reprioritizing, they centered on Spokane, where their son went to college. They had always liked visiting and decided it would be a nice place to move.</p><p>不管是什么原因，而且有很多原因，史蒂夫·麦克唐纳决定不再和洛杉矶交往。他想要一个更小、更便宜的城市，大到可以找到一家像样的餐厅，但不至于让人觉得它的问题无法解决，每一个小任务都像是一次冒险。大流行袭来后，他和妻子经历了一次重大的优先权调整，他们把注意力集中在斯波坎，他们的儿子在那里上大学。他们一直都喜欢参观，并认为这将是一个很好的搬家的地方。</p><p> Eastern Washington was of course much colder. Until this winter, Mr. MacDonald, a native Southern Californian, had never shoveled snow. But their new house is twice as big as their Los Angeles home, cost less than half as much and is a five-minute commute from City Hall, where Mr. MacDonald works as Spokane’s director of community and economic development.</p><p>华盛顿东部当然要冷得多。直到今年冬天，出生在南加州的麦克唐纳从未铲过雪。但他们的新房子是他们在洛杉矶的房子的两倍大，价格不到一半，距离市政厅只有五分钟的通勤时间。麦克唐纳在市政厅担任斯波坎的社区和经济发展总监。</p><p> He arrives each day to tackle a familiar conundrum: how to prevent Spokane from developing the same kinds of problems that people like him are moving there to escape.</p><p>他每天都来解决一个熟悉的难题：如何防止斯波坎发展成像他这样的人搬到那里逃避的那种问题。</p><p>  “I’m realizing more and more how important the future prosperity of this city is about getting housing right,” he said. “If we don’t, it’s going to track more closely with what happened in Los Angeles.”</p><p>他说：“我越来越意识到，这个城市未来的繁荣对于获得合适的住房是多么重要。”。“如果我们不这样做，它将更密切地追踪洛杉矶发生的事情。”</p><p> Mr. MacDonald knows the pattern, and so does everyone else who has been following the frenetic U.S. housing market for the past decade. The story plays out locally but is national in scope. It is the story of people leaving high-cost cities because they’ve been priced out or become fed up with how impossible the housing problem seems. Then it becomes the story of a city trying to tame prices by building more housing, followed by the story of neighbors fighting to prevent it, followed by the story of less expensive cities being deluged with buyers from more expensive cities, followed by the less expensive cities descending into the same problems and struggling with the same solutions.</p><p>麦克唐纳知道这种模式，过去十年来一直在关注疯狂的美国房地产市场的其他人也知道。这个故事在当地上演，但在全国范围内。这是一个人们离开高成本城市的故事，因为他们已经被定价过高，或者厌倦了住房问题似乎是多么不可能。然后它变成了一个城市试图通过建造更多住房来控制价格的故事，接着是邻居奋力阻止房价上涨的故事，接着是价格较低的城市挤满了来自价格较高城市的买家的故事，其次是成本较低的城市陷入同样的问题，并努力寻找同样的解决方案。</p><p> It’s easier to change where we live than it is to change how we live.</p><p>改变我们生活的地方比改变我们的生活方式更容易。</p><p> Whether it’s  Boise or  Reno or  Portland or  Austin, the American housing market is caught in a  vicious cycle of broken expectations that operates like a food chain: The sharks flee New York and Los Angeles and gobble up the housing in Austin and Portland, whose priced-out home buyers swim to the cheaper feeding grounds of places like Spokane. The cycle brings bitterness and “ Don’t Move Here” bumper stickers — and in Spokane it has been supercharged during the pandemic and companies’ shift to remote work.</p><p>无论是博伊西、里诺、波特兰还是奥斯汀，美国的房地产市场都陷入了一个预期破灭的恶性循环，就像食物链一样运作：鲨鱼逃离纽约和洛杉矶，吞噬奥斯汀和波特兰的房屋，他们的买房者纷纷涌向斯波坎等地的廉价食物区。这种循环带来了痛苦和“不要在这里移动”的保险杠贴纸——在斯波坎，在大流行和公司转向远程工作的过程中，这种循环得到了加强。</p><p> No matter how many times it happens, no matter how many cities and states try to blunt it with recommendations to build more housing and provide subsidies for those who can’t afford the new stuff, no matter how many zoning battles are fought or homeless camps lamented, no next city, as of yet, seems better prepared than the last one was.</p><p>无论这种情况发生了多少次，无论有多少城市和州试图用建造更多住房和为那些买不起新东西的人提供补贴的建议来削弱它，无论发生了多少次分区大战或无家可归者营地的哀叹，到目前为止，似乎没有一个城市比上一个城市准备得更好。</p><p>  Just a few years ago, a Spokane household that made the median income could afford about two-thirds of the homes on the market, according to Zillow. Now home prices are up 60 percent over the past two years, pricing out broad swaths of the populace and fomenting an escalating housing crisis marked by resentment, zoning fights and tents.</p><p>Zillow称，就在几年前，一个收入达到中等水平的斯波坎家庭可以负担市场上大约三分之二的住房。现在，房价在过去两年里上涨了60%，使广大民众失去了信心，引发了以怨恨、分区大战和帐篷为特征的住房危机。</p><p>  Being an “it” place was something Spokane’s leaders had long hoped for. The city and its metropolitan region have spent decades trying to convince out-of-town professionals and businesses that it would be a great place to move. Now their wish has been granted, and the city is grappling with the consequences.</p><p>成为一个“it”场所是斯波坎的领导人长期以来的期望。这座城市及其大都会区花了几十年的时间，试图说服外地的专业人士和企业相信，这将是一个很好的搬迁地点。现在，他们的愿望得到了满足，城市正在努力应对后果。</p><p> More fascinating tales you can’t help but read all the way to the end.</p><p>更多引人入胜的故事，你会情不自禁地读到最后。</p><p> Garage doors, a straightforward finishing touch, have become a source of woe for the home-building industry,  thanks to supply-chain issues.</p><p>车库门，一个简单的画龙点睛，由于供应链问题，已经成为住宅建筑行业的一个祸根。</p><p> Was the  “Russian flu” of the late 19th century actually a pandemic driven by a coronavirus? And could its course give us clues about our pandemic?</p><p>19世纪末的“俄罗斯流感”真的是由冠状病毒引起的大流行吗？它的进程能为我们提供有关大流行的线索吗？</p><p> Our reporter hid seven tracking devices in her husband’s belongings to see  how invasive they were and which ones he would find.</p><p>我们的记者在她丈夫的物品中藏了七个追踪装置，看看它们有多具有侵入性，他会找到哪些。</p><p> Growth is never perfect, and Spokane’s influx has been accompanied by a booming employment market that has increased wages, turned abandoned warehouses into offices and helped the city recover jobs lost during the pandemic. This is normally called progress. But for people who already lived in and around Spokane or the suburbs just across the border in north Idaho, the shift from living in a place that was broadly affordable to broadly not has come on with the suddenness of a car crash. Now many workers are wondering what the point of growth is if it only makes it harder to keep a roof over their head.</p><p>增长从来都不是完美的，斯波坎的涌入伴随着一个蓬勃发展的就业市场，该市场提高了工资，将废弃的仓库变成了办公室，并帮助该市恢复了疫情期间失去的工作岗位。这通常被称为进步。但对于那些已经住在斯波坎及其周边地区或北爱达荷州边境对面的郊区的人来说，从一个基本上可以负担得起的地方到一个基本上不可以负担的地方的转变，已经伴随着一场车祸的突然发生。现在，许多工人都在想，如果这只会让他们更难维持生计，那么增长的意义何在。</p><p> Even the mayor isn’t immune. In an interview, Nadine Woodward, a Republican who was elected in 2019, noted that her son and daughter-in-law, newlyweds who moved home during the pandemic, were living with her and her husband while they figured out where they could afford to settle. They came back to Spokane from Seattle, where they were long ago priced out. Austin was the next city on their list, but then its home prices shot up to about where Seattle’s were when they left. At this point, even Spokane is seeming pricey.</p><p>就连市长也不能幸免。2019年当选的共和党人纳丁·伍德沃德（Nadine Woodward）在一次采访中指出，她的儿子和儿媳（在疫情期间搬回家的新婚夫妇）与她和丈夫住在一起，同时他们也在考虑自己能在哪里安顿下来。他们从西雅图回到斯波坎，在那里他们很久以前就被卖光了。奥斯汀是他们名单上的下一个城市，但随后其房价飙升至他们离开西雅图时的水平。在这一点上，就连斯波坎似乎也很昂贵。</p><p> “I never thought I’d see the day where my adult children couldn’t afford a home in Spokane,” Ms. Woodward said.</p><p>伍德沃德说：“我从没想过有一天我的成年子女买不起斯波坎的房子。”。</p><p>  Standing by a snow-covered lawn on an overcast afternoon, Steve Silbar, a local real estate agent who has been selling homes for five years, explained Spokane’s transformation in terms of a six-inch screen. When he thinks of a typical buyer, Mr. Silbar said, he imagines a couple thousands of miles away, perhaps on a beach, looking at their phones. They’re considering moving to a cheaper city, and do a search for homes.</p><p>在一个阴天的下午，当地房地产经纪人史蒂夫·西尔巴（Steve Silbar）站在白雪覆盖的草坪旁，已经卖了五年的房子，他用六英寸屏幕解释了斯波坎的转变。西尔巴说，当他想到一个典型的买家时，他会想象几千英里外，或许在海滩上，他在看他们的手机。他们正在考虑搬到一个更便宜的城市，寻找住房。</p><p> Clients like this are why Mr. Silbar invested $3,000 in a camera that allows him to create three-dimensional tours of his listings, and why the exterior of every home he sells is showcased with an aerial video shot by a drone. In a market that attracts so many outsiders, a virtual walk through the interior and bird’s-eye flight over the street can be the nudge buyers need to bid on a home they’ve never entered, in a city they’ve never seen.</p><p>这就是为什么西尔巴投资3000美元购买了一台摄像机，让他能够对房源进行三维漫游，以及为什么他出售的每套房子的外部都会用无人机拍摄的空中视频进行展示。在一个吸引了如此多外来者的市场中，虚拟的室内漫步和街道上的鸟瞰飞行可能是买家在一个他们从未进入过的城市中，对一套他们从未见过的房子进行竞价所需的推动。</p><p>  “I have to assume that the person that is looking at my listing has never been to Spokane, does not know about Spokane, has no clue,” Mr. Silbar said.</p><p>西尔巴说：“我不得不假设，查看我名单的人从未去过斯波坎，不知道斯波坎的情况，也没有任何线索。”。</p><p>  Spokane is the largest city on the road from Seattle to Minneapolis. This fact is frequently cited as the logic behind its economy: It’s between things. The city was incorporated in 1881 and grew into a transportation hub for the surrounding mining and logging industries. It remains a hub, only instead of shipping out timber and silver, businesses revolve around Fairchild Air Force Base and a collection of hospitals and universities that draw from the rural towns that stretch from eastern Washington to northern Idaho and into western Montana.</p><p>斯波坎是西雅图至明尼阿波利斯公路上最大的城市。这一事实经常被引用为其经济背后的逻辑：它介于事物之间。这座城市成立于1881年，并发展成为周边采矿业和伐木业的交通枢纽。它仍然是一个中心，只是没有运出木材和白银，而是围绕着飞兆半导体空军基地和一系列医院和大学开展业务，这些医院和大学来自从华盛顿东部到爱达荷州北部和蒙大拿州西部的农村城镇。</p><p> The transition from past to present plays out across a skyline in which the usual collection of anonymous bank and hotel towers is broken up by historic brick buildings that seem to be either in a state of abandonment or rehabilitation or occupied by low-rent tenants while waiting for redevelopment. The current boom has already made its mark in the form of new apartment towers, warehouses turned office buildings and an empty lot that will soon contain a 22-story building that will be the city’s tallest.</p><p>从过去到现在的过渡跨越了一条天际线，在这条天际线中，通常匿名的银行和酒店大楼被历史悠久的砖房分割开来，这些砖房似乎要么处于废弃状态，要么处于翻修状态，要么在等待重建时被廉租租户占据。目前的繁荣已经在新的公寓楼、仓库变成的办公楼和一片空地上留下了印记，这些空地将很快包含一栋22层的建筑，这将是该市最高的建筑。</p><p> Driving around town, Michael Sharapata, a commercial real estate broker who moved to Spokane from the Bay Area in 2017, gave a staccato accounting of new leases, such as the millions of square feet that Amazon occupies out by the airport, or the satellite offices rented by various regional accounting and building firms.</p><p>2017年从湾区搬到斯波坎的商业房地产经纪人迈克尔·沙拉帕塔（Michael Sharapata）开车在镇上转悠，对新租约进行了断断续续的核算，比如亚马逊在机场占用的数百万平方英尺，或者各地区会计和建筑公司租用的卫星办公室。</p><p> His family is coming, too. After Mr. Sharapata and his wife moved north, they were followed, in rapid succession, by his brother-in-law in Austin, another brother-in-law in the Bay Area and his sister-in-law in Salt Lake City.</p><p>他的家人也要来。沙拉帕塔和妻子北上后，他在奥斯汀的姐夫、湾区的另一位姐夫和盐湖城的嫂子接二连三地跟着他们。</p><p> “We were looking for an affordable community that had an opportunity to accommodate all of us,” he said.</p><p>“我们正在寻找一个负担得起的社区，有机会容纳我们所有人，”他说。</p><p>  As in most of urban America, much of the growth in the Spokane area is on the fringes, where heavy equipment and the skeletal outlines of new subdivisions unfold in every direction and into Idaho. Building permits have surged, and the cadre of mostly local builders who had the market more or less to themselves now grumble that the rapid growth has attracted big national builders like D.R. Horton and Toll Brothers.</p><p>与美国大部分城市一样，斯波坎地区的大部分增长都在边缘地带，重型设备和新分区的轮廓向各个方向延伸，并延伸到爱达荷州。建筑许可证数量激增，大部分是本地建筑商的干部或多或少都有自己的市场，现在他们抱怨说，快速增长吸引了D.R.霍顿和托尔兄弟等大型全国建筑商。</p><p> All of this happened fairly recently. In the years after the Great Recession, when homebuilders were in bankruptcy or hibernation, migration to the Spokane region plunged. That pattern shifted in 2014 when, as if a switch had been flipped, waves of migrants started arriving as already high-cost cities like Seattle and San Francisco saw their housing markets go into a tech-fueled frenzy.</p><p>所有这些都是最近发生的。大衰退后的几年里，当房屋建筑商破产或冬眠时，向斯波坎地区的移民急剧减少。这种模式在2014的时候发生了变化，好像一个交换机被翻转了一样，大批移民开始涌入，像西雅图和旧金山这样的高成本城市看到他们的住房市场陷入了科技狂热。</p><p> By the end of 2014, migration to the Spokane region had jumped to more than 2,000 net new residents, compared with a net loss the year before, according to Equifax and Moody’s Analytics. Annual growth has only continued, rising further with the pandemic to more than 4,500 net new residents.</p><p>根据Equifax和Moody's Analytics的数据，截至2014年底，斯波坎地区的新居民净迁移量已跃升至2000多人，而前一年则出现净损失。每年的增长只是在继续，随着大流行进一步上升，新居民净人数超过4500人。</p><p> Sometimes they come for the chance to buy their first home. Other times it’s a bigger house or some land. Joel Sweeney, an academic adviser at Eastern Washington University, wanted the best of both: a single-family house on a quiet street that was close enough to downtown that he could walk to a good brewery. That sort of Goldilocks urbanity could cost a million in Austin, where he and his wife lived until last year. When they moved to Spokane they paid less than a third of that.</p><p>有时他们来是为了有机会买第一套房子。有时是一栋更大的房子或一些土地。东华盛顿大学（Eastern Washington University）的学术顾问乔尔·斯威尼（Joel Sweeney）希望两者兼得：在一条安静的街道上建一栋独栋住宅，离市中心足够近，他可以步行到一家好的酿酒厂。在奥斯汀，这种“金发姑娘”式的温文尔雅可能要花费100万英镑，他和妻子一直住在那里，直到去年。当他们搬到斯波坎时，他们只付了不到三分之一的钱。</p><p> “You could not get a house for $299,000 in Austin where you could walk to a bunch of different stuff,” he said.</p><p>他说：“在奥斯汀，你不可能花29.9万美元买到一套房子，在那里你可以步行去各种各样的地方。”。</p><p>  The white house with the red door sits on a quiet block near Gonzaga University. It has two bedrooms, one bathroom and 1,500 square feet of living space.</p><p>带红门的白宫坐落在冈萨加大学附近一个安静的街区。它有两间卧室、一间浴室和1500平方英尺的生活空间。</p><p>  Mr. Silbar, the real estate agent, has sold it twice in the past three years. The first time, in November 2019, he represented a buyer who offered $168,000 and got it with zero drama. This year it went back on the market, and Mr. Silbar listed it for $250,000. Fourteen offers and a bidding war later, it closed at $300,000.</p><p>房地产经纪人西尔巴在过去三年里已经两次出售了它。2019年11月，他第一次代表一位买家，出价16.8万美元，并以零戏剧性的价格获得。今年它重新上市，西尔巴以25万美元的价格将其上市。14个报价和一场竞价战之后，它以30万美元收盘。</p><p> When Mr. Silbar got into the business, he said, his clients were “nurses and teachers,” and now they’re corporate managers, engineers and other professionals. “What you can afford in Spokane has completely changed,” he said.</p><p>他说，当西尔巴进入这一行业时，他的客户是“护士和教师”，现在他们是企业经理、工程师和其他专业人士。“你在斯波坎能负担得起的已经完全改变了，”他说。</p><p> The typical home in the Spokane area is worth  $411,000, according to Zillow. That’s still vastly less expensive than markets like the San Francisco Bay Area ($1.4 million), Los Angeles ($878,000), Seattle ($734,000) and Portland ($550,000). But it’s dizzying (and enraging) to long-term residents.</p><p>据齐洛介绍，斯波坎地区的典型住宅价值41.1万美元。这仍然比像旧金山湾地区（140万美元）、洛杉矶（878000美元）、西雅图（734000美元）和波特兰（550000美元）的市场要便宜得多。但这让长期居住的人感到头晕目眩（并且愤怒）。</p><p> Five years ago,  a little over half the homes in the Spokane area sold for less than $200,000, and about 70 percent of its employed population could afford to buy a home, according to a recent report commissioned by the Spokane Association of Realtors. Now fewer than 5 percent of homes — a few dozen a month — sell for less than $200,000, and less than 15 percent of the area’s employed population can afford a home. A recent survey by Redfin, the real estate brokerage, showed that home buyers moving to Spokane in 2021 had a budget 23 percent higher than what locals had.</p><p>根据斯波坎房地产经纪人协会（Spokane Association of Realtors）最近委托的一份报告，五年前，斯波坎地区超过一半的房屋售价不到20万美元，约70%的就业人口有能力买房。现在，不到5%的房屋——一个月几十套——售价不到20万美元，该地区就业人口中不到15%能买得起房子。房地产经纪公司Reffern最近的一项调查显示，2021购房者搬到斯波坎的预算比本地人高23%。</p><p> One of Mr. Silbar’s clients, Lindsey Simler, a 38-year-old nurse who grew up in Spokane, wants to buy a home in the $300,000 range but keeps losing out because she doesn’t have enough cash to compete. Spokane isn’t so competitive that it’s awash in all-cash offers, as some higher-priced markets are. But prices have shot up so fast that many homes are appraising for less than their sale price, forcing buyers to put up higher down payments to cover the difference.</p><p>西尔巴的客户之一、38岁的护士林赛·西姆勒（Lindsey Simler）在斯波坎（Spokane）长大，她想买一套30万美元范围内的房子，但由于没有足够的现金来竞争，她一直在输。斯波坎并不像一些价格更高的市场那样，充满了现金流。但房价飙升如此之快，以至于许多房屋的估价低于其销售价格，迫使买家支付更高的首付以弥补差额。</p><p> A dozen failed offers later, Ms. Simler has decided to sit out the market for a while because the constant losing is so demoralizing. If prices don’t calm down, she said, she’s thinking about becoming a travel nurse. With the health care work force so depleted by Covid-19, travel nursing pays much better and, hopefully, will allow her to save more for a down payment.</p><p>十几个失败的报价之后，西姆勒决定暂时退出市场，因为不断的亏损让人士气低落。她说，如果价格不稳定，她正在考虑成为一名旅行护士。随着C2019冠状病毒疾病的健康护理工作人员的减少，旅行护理费用会大大提高，希望她能节省更多的首付。</p><p> “I’m not at the point where I want to give up on living in Spokane, because I have family here and it feels like home,” she said. “But travel nursing is going to be my next step if I haven’t been able to land a house.”</p><p>她说：“我现在还不想放弃在斯波坎的生活，因为我在这里有家人，感觉就像在家一样。”。“但如果我还没能找到房子，旅行护理将是我的下一步。”</p><p>  From her seventh-floor office atop the Art Deco City Hall, Ms. Woodward, the mayor, looked out at the Spokane River, where in the warmer months a gondola glides past her window to a park built for the World’s Fair. Spokane hosted the fair in 1974 as a means of revitalizing its blighted downtown, and during the recent interview Ms. Woodward pointed out the window at cranes and construction sites that she calls “positive activity.”</p><p>市长伍德沃德从装饰艺术市政厅顶层的七楼办公室向外眺望斯波坎河，在温暖的几个月里，一辆敞篷车从她的窗户滑过，来到为世博会而建的公园。斯波坎在1974年主办了这场博览会，作为振兴其破败的市中心的一种手段。在最近的采访中，伍德沃德女士指出了起重机和建筑工地的窗口，她称之为“积极活动”</p><p> Spokane’s job market is among of the strongest in the nation, and the virtuous economic cycle — of people coming for housing, causing businesses to come for people, causing more people to come for jobs — is in full swing. And yet, as in Seattle and California before and increasingly across the nation, the scourge of rising prices, particularly for rent and housing, makes it feel less virtuous than advertised.</p><p>斯波坎的就业市场是美国最强劲的就业市场之一，而良性经济循环——人们来这里买房，导致企业来找人，导致更多人来找工作——正在如火如荼地进行。然而，就像之前在西雅图和加利福尼亚州一样，而且越来越多地在全国范围内，不断上涨的价格，尤其是租金和住房价格，让人们觉得它不如宣传的那么高尚。</p><p> The recent Realtors report warned of “significant social implications” if the city doesn’t tackle housing. The issues included young families not being able to buy or taking on excessive debt, small businesses not being able to hire, difficulty keeping young college graduates in town.</p><p>最近的房地产经纪人报告警告说，如果该市不解决住房问题，将产生“重大社会影响”。这些问题包括年轻家庭无法购买或承担过多债务，小企业无法雇佣，年轻大学毕业生难以留在城里。</p><p> In the dominoes of the housing market, the disappointments of aspiring buyers like Ms. Simler get magnified as they move down to lower-income households. With homes so hard to buy, rents have shot up, and the vacancy rate for apartments is close  to zero.</p><p>在房地产市场的多米诺骨牌中，像西姆勒这样有抱负的购房者的失望情绪随着他们搬到低收入家庭而加剧。由于住房如此难以购买，租金飙升，公寓空置率接近于零。</p><p> All of this has compounded at the lowest end of the market, where the nonprofit Volunteers of America’s Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho affiliate, which runs three shelters and maintains 240 apartments for people who were formerly homeless, said it will lose a quarter of its units in the next fiscal year as more of its funding goes to higher rents.</p><p>这一切在市场的最低端更加复杂，在那里，美国华盛顿东部和爱达荷州北部附属机构的非营利志愿者经营着三个庇护所，为以前无家可归的人提供240套公寓，该公司表示，随着更多资金流向更高的租金，它将在下一个财政年度失去四分之一的单元。</p><p>  In December, as temperatures dropped and shelters filled, advocates and members of the homeless population protested by setting up several dozen tents on the City Hall steps. The encampment was gone two weeks later but has since been reconstructed on a patch of dirt on the other side of town. In the winter cold it smells like ash and soot from the open fires burning to keep people warm.</p><p>12月，随着气温下降，庇护所人满为患，倡导人士和无家可归者成员在市政厅台阶上搭建了几十顶帐篷进行抗议。两周后，营地消失了，但后来在城镇另一边的一片泥土上重建。在寒冷的冬天，它闻起来像是为了取暖而燃烧的明火中的灰烬和煤烟。</p><p>  Last year, Ms. Woodward declared a housing emergency, and her administration has put in place initiatives that mirror those of housing-troubled cities on the West Coast. The city has built new shelters, is encouraging developers to repurpose commercial buildings into apartments, is making it easier for residents to build backyard units and is rezoning the city to allow duplexes and other multiunit buildings in single-family neighborhoods.</p><p>去年，伍德沃德宣布了住房紧急状态，她的政府也实施了一些举措，以反映西海岸住房问题城市的情况。该市修建了新的庇护所，鼓励开发商将商业建筑改造成公寓，使居民更容易建造后院单元，并正在重新规划该市，允许在单户社区建造复式和其他多单元建筑。</p><p> Ms. Woodward pointed to Kendall Yards, one of the developments outside her City Hall window, as an example of what she wanted to see more of. The mixed-density project could be a postcard picture of what economists and planners say is needed to combat the nation’s housing shortage and sprawl. In defiance of the single-family zoning laws that dictate the look of most U.S. neighborhoods,  Kendall Yards has houses next to townhomes next to apartments, with retail and office mixed in.</p><p>伍德沃德以肯德尔庭院为例，这是她市政厅窗外的一处开发项目，她希望看到更多的东西。混合密度项目可能是一张明信片，展示了经济学家和规划者所说的对抗美国住房短缺和扩张所需要的东西。肯德尔庭院（Kendall Yards）的住宅毗邻联排别墅，毗邻公寓，零售和办公楼混杂在一起，这与规定了美国大多数社区外观的单户分区法背道而驰。</p><p> People in town seem to love it, but are leery of there being more places like it, especially in their neighborhood.</p><p>镇上的人似乎很喜欢它，但对有更多这样的地方持怀疑态度，尤其是在他们的社区。</p><p> “I think it’s awesome — I have friends there, and we go down there to the farmers’ market and walk around,” said John Schram, a co-chair of the neighborhood council in Spokane’s Comstock neighborhood. “That’s just not my vision of what I want for me.
