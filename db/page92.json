Now, he has received validation for a proof at the heart of his quest from an unlikely source: a computer.\n Although most mathematicians doubt that machines will replace the creative aspects of their profession anytime soon, some acknowledge that technology will play an increasingly important role in their research \u2014 and this particular feat could be a turning point towards its acceptance.\n Scholze, a number theorist, set forth the ambitious plan \u2014 which he co-created with his collaborator Dustin Clausen from the University of Copenhagen \u2014 in a series of lectures in 2019 at the University of Bonn, Germany, where he is based. The two researchers dubbed it \u2018condensed mathematics\u2019, and they say it promises to bring new insights and connections between fields ranging from geometry to number theory.\n Other researchers are paying attention: Scholze is considered one of mathematics\u2019 brightest stars and has a track record of introducing revolutionary concepts. Emily Riehl, a mathematician at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, says that if Scholze and Clausen\u2019s vision is realized, the way mathematics is taught to graduate students in 50 years\u2019 time could be very different than it is today. \u201cThere are a lot of areas of mathematics that I think in the future will be affected by his ideas,\u201d she says.\n Until now, much of that vision rested on a technical proof so involved that even Scholze and Clausen couldn\u2019t be sure it was correct. But earlier this month, Scholze announced that a project to check the heart of the proof using specialized computer software had been successful.\n  Mathematicians have long used computers to do numerical calculations or manipulate complex formulas. In some cases, they have proved major results by making computers do massive amounts of repetitive work \u2014 the most famous being a proof in the 1970s that any map can be coloured with just four different colours, and without filling any two adjacent countries with the same colour.\n  But systems known as proof assistants go deeper. The user enters statements into the system to teach it the definition of a mathematical concept \u2014 an object \u2014 based on simpler objects that the machine already knows about. A statement can also just refer to known objects, and the proof assistant will answer whether the fact is \u2018obviously\u2019 true or false based on its current knowledge. If the answer is not obvious, the user has to enter more details. Proof assistants thus force the user to lay out the logic of their arguments in a rigorous way, and they fill in simpler steps that human mathematicians had consciously or unconsciously skipped.\n Once researchers have done the hard work of translating a set of mathematical concepts into a proof assistant, the program generates a library of computer code that can be built on by other researchers and used to define higher-level mathematical objects. In this way, proof assistants can help to verify mathematical proofs that would otherwise be time-consuming and difficult, perhaps even practically impossible, for a human to check.\n Proof assistants have long had their fans, but this is the first time that they have played a major role at the cutting edge of a field, says Kevin Buzzard, a mathematician at Imperial College London who was part of a collaboration that checked Scholze and Clausen\u2019s result. \u201cThe big remaining question was: can they handle complex mathematics?\u201d Says Buzzard. \u201cWe showed that they can.\u201d\n And it all happened much faster than anyone had imagined. Scholze  laid out his challenge to proof-assistant experts in December 2020, and it was taken up by a group of volunteers led by Johan Commelin, a mathematician at the University of Freiburg in Germany. On 5 June \u2014 less than six months later \u2014  Scholze posted on Buzzard\u2019s blog that the main part of the experiment had succeeded. \u201cI find it absolutely insane that interactive proof assistants are now at the level that, within a very reasonable time span, they can formally verify difficult original research,\u201d Scholze wrote.\n  The crucial point of condensed mathematics, according to Scholze and Clausen, is to redefine the concept of topology, one of the cornerstones of modern maths. A lot of the objects that mathematicians study have a topology \u2014 a type of structure that determines which of the object\u2019s parts are close together and which aren\u2019t. Topology provides a notion of shape, but one that is more malleable than those of familiar, school-level geometry: in topology, any transformation that does not tear an object apart is admissible. For example, any triangle is topologically equivalent to any other triangle \u2014 or even to a circle \u2014 but not to a straight line.\n Topology plays a crucial part not only in geometry, but also in functional analysis, the study of functions. Functions typically \u2018live\u2019 in spaces with an infinite number of dimensions (such as wavefunctions, which are foundational to quantum mechanics). It is also important for number systems called  p-adic numbers, which have an exotic, \u2018fractal\u2019 topology.\n  Around 2018, Scholze and Clausen began to realize that the conventional approach to the concept of topology led to incompatibilities between these three mathematical universes \u2014 geometry, functional analysis and  p-adic numbers \u2014 but that alternative foundations could bridge those gaps. Many results in each of those fields seem to have analogues in the others, even though they apparently deal with completely different concepts. But once topology is defined in the \u2018correct\u2019 way, the analogies between the theories are revealed to be instances of the same \u2018condensed mathematics\u2019, the two researchers proposed. \u201cIt is some kind of grand unification\u201d of the three fields, Clausen says.\n Scholze and Clausen say they have already found simpler, \u2018condensed\u2019 proofs of a number of profound geometry facts, and that they can now prove theorems that were previously unknown. They have not yet made these public.\n There was one catch, however: to show that geometry fits into this picture, Scholze and Clausen had to prove one highly technical theorem about the set of ordinary real numbers, which has the topology of a straight line. \u201cIt\u2019s like the foundational theorem that allows the real numbers to enter this new framework,\u201d Commelin explains.\n  Clausen recalls how Scholze worked relentlessly on the proof until it was completed \u2018through force of will\u2019, producing many original ideas in the process. \u201cIt was the most amazing mathematical feat I\u2019ve ever witnessed,\u201d Clausen recalls. But the argument was so complex that Scholze himself worried there could be some subtle gap that invalidated the whole enterprise. \u201cIt looked convincing, but it was simply too novel,\u201d says Clausen.\n For help checking that work, Scholze turned to Buzzard, a fellow number theorist who is an expert in Lean, a proof-assistant software package. Lean was originally created by a computer scientist at Microsoft Research in Redmond, Washington, for the purpose of rigorously checking computer code for bugs.\n Buzzard had been running a multi-year programme to encode the entire undergraduate maths curriculum at Imperial into Lean. He had also experimented with entering more-advanced mathematics into the system, including the concept of perfectoid spaces, which helped to earn Scholze a Fields Medal in 2018.\n Commelin, who is also a number theorist, took the lead in the effort to verify Scholze and Clausen\u2019s proof. Commelin and Scholze decided to call their Lean project the Liquid Tensor Experiment, in an  homage to progressive-rock band Liquid Tension Experiment, of which both mathematicians are fans.\n A febrile online collaboration ensued. A dozen or so mathematicians with experience in Lean joined in, and the researchers got help from computer scientists along the way. By early June, the team had fully translated the heart of Scholze\u2019s proof \u2014 the part that worried him the most \u2014 into Lean. And it all checked out \u2014 the software was able to verify this part of the proof.\n  The Lean version of Scholze\u2019s proof comprises tens of thousands of lines of code, 100 times longer than the original version, Commelin says. \u201cIf you just look at the Lean code, you will have a very hard time understanding the proof, especially the way it is now.\u201d But the researchers say that the effort of getting the proof to work in the computer has helped them to understand it better, too.\n  Riehl is among the mathematicians who have experimented with proof assistants, and even teaches them in some of her undergraduate classes. She says that, although she doesn\u2019t systematically use them in her research, they have begun to change the very way she thinks of the practices of constructing mathematical concepts and stating and proving theorems about them. \u201cPreviously, I thought of proving and constructing as of two different things, and now I think of them as the same.\u201d\n Many researchers say that mathematicians are unlikely to be replaced by machines any time soon. Proof assistants can\u2019t read a maths textbook, they need continuous input from humans, and they can\u2019t decide whether a mathematical statement is interesting or profound \u2014 only whether it is correct, Buzzard says. Still, computers might soon be able to point out consequences of the known facts that mathematicians had failed to notice, he adds.\n Scholze says he was surprised by how far proof assistants could go, but that he is unsure whether they will continue to have a major role in his research. \u201cFor now, I can\u2019t really see how they would help me in my creative work as a mathematician.\u201d",

bring its Confidential Cloud Software Platform to market and to evolve its technology and security innovations in the enterprise confidential computing market.\n Insight Partners led the Series B round.\u00a0Founded in 2018, the company provides a platform that leverages confidential computing technologies to lock down data and application workloads. The solution is said to isolate workloads from would-be attackers or rogue insiders and software.\n Protecting applications requires protecting the application itself and the infrastructure, which Anjuna says results in many companies not moving sensitive workloads to the public cloud. The company pitches itself as a way to harden machines and create security zones to define which applications that can run alongside other applications on the same machine.\n By creating a software perimeter around applications that provides hardware-grade security, Anjuna said, its solution removes the need to secure or patch the host, VM or container.\n According to the company, organizations can now fully lock down data and applications during runtime, closing a critical gap to shut out insiders, attackers and rogue software, even if they gain root access to a host. The protection is said to work seamlessly across storage, networks, multicloud or hybrid cloud environments from different vendors and on-premises data centers. The company\u2019s software transparently deploys within the enterprise ecosystem, securing all data in all states including support for packaged and legacy enterprise applications instantly and without modification, Anjuna said.\n \u201cAnjuna makes it practical to use powerful hardware-level security features in clouds and servers from all major providers,\u201d Ayal Yogev, co-founder and chief executive of Anjuna, said in a statement. \u201cThis can transparently accommodate software applications unchanged while extending hardware-grade protection uniformly across all of IT infrastructure.\u201d\n Including the new funding, Anjuna has raised $32.1 million to date,\u00a0 according to data from Crunchbase. Previous investors include Uncorrelated Ventures, Playground Global, Y Combinator, Drom Room Fund, DCVC and Founder Collective.\n  Show your support for our mission by joining our Cube Club and Cube Event Community of experts.

above and the associated question \u2013  What did they hold before opening the closet?. After looking at the video, you can easily answer that the person is holding a phone. People have a remarkable ability to comprehend visual events in new videos and to answer questions about that video. We can decompose visual events and  actions into  individual interactions between the  person and other  objects. For instance, the  person initially  holds a  phone and then  opens the closet and  takes out a picture. To answer this question, we need to recognize the action \u201c opening the closet\u201d and then understand how \u201c before\u201d should restrict our search for the answer to events before this action. Next, we need to detect the interaction \u201c holding\u201d and identify the object being held as a \u201c phone\u201d to finally arrive at the answer. We understand questions as a composition of individual reasoning steps and videos as a composition of individual interactions over time.\n Designing machines that can similarly exhibit compositional understanding of visual events has been a core goal of the computer vision community. To measure progress towards this goal, the community has released numerous video question answering benchmarks ( TGIF-QA,  MSVD/MSRVTT,  CLEVRER,  ActivityNet-QA). These benchmarks evaluate models by asking questions about videos and measure the models\u2019 answer accuracy. Over the last few years, model performance on such benchmarks have been encouraging:\n  However, it is unclear why models are improving. Simple questions like \u201cWhat did they  hold  before  opening the closet?\u201d require a composition of many different reasoning capabilities. Are the models improving at recognizing  actions? On understanding  interactions? Or are they just improving on exploiting linguistic and visual biases in the dataset? Since these benchmarks primarily offer a single \u201coverall accuracy\u201d metric as an evaluation measure, we have a limited view of each model\u2019s strengths and weaknesses.\n To better answer these questions, we introduce the benchmark Action Genome Question Answering (AGQA). AGQA measures spatial, temporal, and compositional reasoning through nearly two hundred million question answering pairs. AGQA\u2019s questions are complex, compositional, and annotated to allow for explicit tests that find the types of questions that models can and cannot answer.\n  Creating a benchmark at this scale is prohibitively expensive to scale with human annotators. Instead, we design a synthetic generation process using rules-based question templates to generate questions from scene information, which represents what occurs in the video using symbols (Figure 3: spatio-temporal scene graphs from  Action Genome). Synthetic generation allows us to control the content, structure, and compositional reasoning steps required to answer each generated question.\n We ran state of the art models on our benchmark and found that they performed poorly, relied heavily on linguistic biases, and struggled to generalize to more complex tasks. In fact, all the models performed barely above an ablation where the video was not presented as an input at all.\n  Action Genome Question Answering has  192 Million complex and compositional question-answer pairs. We also sample  3.9 Million question-answer pairs such that this subset has a more even distribution of answers and a wider diversity of questions. Each question has detailed annotations about the content in and structure of the question. These annotations include a program of the reasoning steps needed to answer the question and a mapping of items in the question to the relevant part of the video (Figure 4). AGQA also provides detailed metrics, including test splits to measure performance on different question types and three new metrics designed to measure compositional reasoning.\n  To synthetically generate questions, we first represent the video through scene graphs (Figure 3). We take a sample of frames from the video in which each frame annotates the actions, objects, and relationships that occur in that frame. Second, we built 28 templates. These templates include a natural language frame referencing types of items within the scene graphs. In Figure 4, the template provides a general natural language frame asking if the subject did a  relationship on an  object during a specified  time period. Each template also has a program outlining a series of steps to follow in order to answer the question. The example in Figure 4 iterates over the  time period, finds all the objects on which they had that  relationship, then determines if the specified  object exists within that list.\n  Third, we combine the scene graphs and the templates to generate natural language question-answer pairs. For example, the above template could use the scene graph from Figure 3 to generate the natural language question \u201cDid they  watch  a phone  before  lying down?\u201d. The associated program then automatically generates the answer by iterating over the time  before they were  lying down, finding all the items they were  watching , and determining that they do not  watch  a phone during that time. Combining the scene graphs and templates creates a wide variety of natural language question-answer pairs. Each pair in our benchmark includes a reference to the program of reasoning steps used to generate the answer, as well as a mapping that grounds words in the question to the scene graph annotations. Finally, we take the generated pairs and balance the distributions of answer and question types. We smooth answer distributions for different categories then sample questions such that the dataset has a diversity of question structures.\n  Human evaluation. We validate our question-answer pairs through human validation and find that annotators agree with 86.02% of our answers. To put this number in context,  GQAand  CLEVR, two recent automated benchmarks, report 89.30% and 92.60% human accuracy, respectively. Some scene graphs have inconsistent, incorrect, or missing information in the scene graphs that propagate into incorrect questions. There may also be differences between the ontologies of the scene graph and human understood definitions. For example, there are 36 objects in the scene graphs, but humans may consider objects that appear in the video but are not within the model\u2019s purview.\n We provide further detail on the human tasks, each of these error sources, and recommendations for future video representations in the supplementary section of our paper.\n Model performance depends on linguistic biases. We run three state of the art models on our benchmark ( HCRN,  HME, and  PSAC), and find that the models struggle on our benchmark. If the model only chose the most likely answer (\u201cNo\u201d) it would achieve a 10.35% accuracy. The highest scoring model, HME, achieved a 47.74% accuracy, which at first glance appears to be a big improvement. However, further investigation found that much of the gain in accuracy comes from just exploiting linguistic biases instead of from visual reasoning. Although HCRN achieved 47.42% accuracy overall, it still achieved a 47% accuracy without seeing the videos. The fact that the model is so dependent on linguistic biases instead of visual reasoning reduces the ability of our other test splits to effectively measure visual reasoning for these particular models.\n Measurement of different question attributes. We provide splits in the test set to measure model performance on different types of reasoning skills, semantic categories, and question structures.\n To understand model performance on different types of questions, we split the test set by the reasoning skills needed to answer the question. For example, some questions test superlative concepts like first and last ( What did they pick up first, a dish or a picture?), some compare the duration of multiple actions ( Was the person eating some food or sitting on the floor for longer?), and others require activity recognition ( What were they doing last?). Different models achieved the highest accuracy in each category. Model performance also varied widely among these categories, with all three models performing the worst on activity recognition.\n AGQA also splits questions by if their semantic focus is on objects, relationships, or actions. Only choosing the most common answer would lead to a 9.38%, 50%, and 32.91% accuracy on questions about objects, relationships, and actions respectively. The highest performing models achieved a 42.48% accuracy for object-oriented questions, while the blind model achieved a 40.74% accuracy. The blind model outperformed all other models with a 67.40% accuracy for relationship-oriented questions, and a 60.95% accuracy on action-oriented questions.\n Finally, we annotate each question by its structure. Query questions are open-answered ( What did they hold?). Verify questions verify if a question is true ( Did they hold a dish?). Logic questions use a logical operator ( Did they hold a dish but not a blanket?). Choose questions offer a choice between two options ( Did they hold a dish or a blanket?). Compare questions compare the attributes of two options ( Compared to holding a dish, were they sitting for longer?). Every model performed the worst on open-answered questions and best on verify and logic questions.\n New compositionality metrics. We also provide three new metrics that specifically measure compositional reasoning. These split the training and test sets to test the model\u2019s ability to generalize to novel compositions of previously seen ideas, to indirect references, and to more compositional steps.\n First, we measure a model\u2019s ability to generalize to novel compositions. We consider a composition to be two discrete ideas, composed together into one instance. For example \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cstanding up\u201d are a composition in the question \u201cWhat did they take before standing up?\u201d. To ensure these compositions are novel in the test set, we include the ideas of before and standing up in the training set when they are composed with other items. However, we do not include questions in the training set in which the before-standing up composition occurs. The models struggle to generalize to the compositions they see for the first time in the test set. The best performing model barely achieves more than 50% accuracy on binary questions that have only two answers. On open answer questions that have more than two possible answers, the highest performing model achieves 23.72% accuracy.\n  Our second metric measures generalization to indirect references. Direct references state what they are referring to (a phone), while indirect references refer to something by its attributes or other relationships (the first thing they held). We use indirect references to increase the complexity of our questions. This metric compares how well models answer a question with indirect references if they can answer it with the direct reference. Models can answer approximately 80% of questions using indirect references if they could answer it with the direct reference.\n The third compositionality metric measures generalization to more complex questions. A training and test split divides the questions such that the training set contains simpler questions with fewer compositional steps, while the test set includes questions with more compositional steps. The models struggle on this task, as none of them outperform 50% on binary questions, which have only two answers.\n Question complexity and accuracy. Finally, we annotate the number of compositional steps needed to answer each question. We find that although humans remain consistent as questions become more complex, models decrease in accuracy.\n   AGQA opens avenues for progress in several directions. Neuro-symbolic and meta learning modeling approaches could improve compositional reasoning. The programmatic breakdown of questions could also inform work on generating explanations. We also invite exploration into employing and generating different symbolic representations of video.\n Our benchmark highlights the weak points of existing models, including overreliance on linguistic biases and a difficulty generalizing to novel and more complex tasks. However, its balanced dataset of question answer pairs and detailed metrics provide a baseline for exploring multiple exciting new directions.\n   Keep on top of the latest SAIL Blog posts via  ,  , or email:", "posttime": "2021-06-24 10:00:30", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7ec4\u6210,benchmark", "title": "AGQA\uff1a\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u57fa\u51c6 ", "title_en": "AGQA: A Benchmark for Compositional, Spatio-Temporal Reasoning", "transed": 1, "url": "http://ai.stanford.edu/blog/agqa/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7ec4\u6210", "benchmark"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7174a0c64ae2d00b1226445af6eec30e.jpg", "infoid": 1067883, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u9644\u52a0\u4fe1\u606f\u5df2\u7ecf\u6d6e\u73b0\u5728\u56fe\u68ee\u4e2d\u7684\u5b98\u5458\u88ab\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e3a\u201c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4fee\u6539\u201d\u540e\u7684\u795e\u79d8\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6d6e\u51fa\u6c34\u9762\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u6d88\u5931\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\uff0c\u5c0f\u65f6\u957f\u7684\u8ffd\u9010\u8fb9\u754c\u5de1\u903b\u76f4\u5347\u673a\u3002\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8be6\u60c5\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u6458\u8981\u7a7a\u6c14\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u8b66\u5bdf\u52aa\u529b\u8ffd\u6c42\u548c\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u88ab\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e3a\u201c\u975e\u5e38\u590d\u6742/\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u50cf\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6765\u7684\u60ca\u4eba\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u827a\u3002\n   \u6700\u521d\u7684\u906d\u9047\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u4e0b\u534810\u70b9\u4e4b\u540e\u3002 2\u67089\u65e5\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u5728\u4e94\u6708\u900f\u9732\u3002\u968f\u540e\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u672c\u6708\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u62a5\u9053\u3002\u6267\u884c\u6458\u8981\u7248\u672c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0e\u56fe\u68ee\u4e0a\u65b9\u7684\u6d77\u5173\u548c\u8fb9\u5883\u5de1\u903b\uff08CBP\uff09\u76f4\u5347\u673a\u76f8\u649e\u3002\u7136\u540e\u65a9\u6ce2\u5668\u968f\u540e\u5c06\u5de5\u827a\u8ffd\u9010\uff0c70\u82f1\u91cc\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc7100\u82f1\u91cc/\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u9ad8\u8fbe14,000\u82f1\u5c3a\u7684\u6d77\u62d4\u9ad8\u5ea6\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u9003\u79bb\u672a\u7528\u6027\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08UAS\uff09\u4fb5\u72af\u53d7\u9650\u5236\u7a7a\u95f4 -

A case summary of the incident details airborne police efforts to pursue and unsuccessfully identify the astonishingly powerful craft described as \u201cvery sophisticated/specialized and able to perform like no other.\u201d\n   The\u00a0 initial encounter\u00a0occurred just after 10 p.m. on Feb. 9, but was only revealed in May.\u00a0 Subsequent information\u00a0was reported earlier this month. The executive summary version is that a drone nearly collided with a Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) helicopter above Tucson. The chopper then chased the craft over a veering, 70-mile course at speeds over 100 mph and altitudes of up to 14,000 feet. During that run, the escaping uncrewed aerial system (UAS) craft violated restricted airspaces \u2013 including those of an Air Force base and Tucson\u2019s airport \u2013 and displayed maneuverability and power reserves far beyond those of a consumer drone.\n  The FBI was brought onto the case and continues searching for the craft and its pilots. Thus far, however, it appears little headway has been made toward illuminating that astonishing (and very illegal) night flight. However, Brett Tingley of  The Drive\u2019s\u00a0 War Zone\u00a0continues his excellent coverage of the story, and has obtained and\u00a0 written up reports\u00a0filed by Tucson police (TPD) whose helicopter joined the chase. At times, it\u2019s hard not to hear a bit of wonder and grudging admiration for the serious chops the law-breaking drone demonstrated before ultimately shaking them.\n The cop copter joined the chase after the CBP reported its near miss, and quickly made visual contact with the fleeing drone. They confirmed FBI descriptions of the craft having only \u201ca single, green position light on the underbody,\u201d but otherwise could not get a good enough look at it to estimate something as basic as size. Even use of night vision goggles \u2013 while looking right at it \u2013 failed to flesh the drone out further.\n  The furtive UAS then put on something of a catch-me-if-you-can show. In their report, TPD pilots say the drone \u201cmaneuvered all over the city\u2026 at about 10,500-11,000 ft\u2026 in a manner to hamper our ability to track it.\u201d Then the super-drone got really cheeky.\n The uas was very sophisticated/specialized and able to perform like no other uas I have ever observed. The uas began flying orbits around our aircraft as we tracked it\u2026 up to an altitude of 12,000 ft (the uas was in excess of 14,000ft), its speed at times well in excess of 100 mph\u2026 (From) its flight path (it) was obvious the controller had clear sight of both the helicopters tracking it by the way it would orbit us and abruptly fly behind us and attempt to avoid our visual contact.\n Despite headwinds of 40 mph, the fleeing craft managed to clear 100 mph. Though pursuing cops had hoped the prolonged hunt would exhaust the drone\u2019s batteries, it \u201cnever displayed signs of reduced\u2026 or weakening power supply.\u201d However, the TPD officers did say the craft occasionally \u201cappeared to move in an erratic pattern as if the signal with its home station was getting weaker, but then would stabilize and continue on its flight path.\u201d\n An hour after it began, the chase ended \u2013 ironically \u2013 with the TPD helicopter having to turn back for refueling, and the CBP unit unable to get another visual fix on the drone. The last time anyone saw it, the super-UAS was \u201cflying in and out of the cloud base at 12,000 ft\u201d before vanishing altogether.\n  You\u2019re reading DroneDJ \u2014 experts who break news about DJI and the wider drone ecosystem, day after day.

", "note_en": "Americans sure love their coffee. Even last spring when the pandemic shut down New York, nearly every neighborhood shop that sold takeout coffee managed to stay open, and I was amazed at how many people ventured forth to start their stay-at-home days with a favorite store-made brew.\n One elderly friend who prepandemic had traveled from Brooklyn to Manhattan by subway to buy her preferred blend of ground coffee arranged to have it delivered. \u201cWell worth the added cost,\u201d she told me. I use machine-brewed coffee from pods, and last summer when it seemed reasonably safe for me to shop I stocked up on a year\u2019s supply of the blends I like. (Happily, the pods are now recyclable.)\n All of us should be happy to know that whatever it took to secure that favorite cup of Joe may actually have  helped to keep us healthy. The  latest assessments of the health effects of coffee and caffeine, its main active ingredient, are reassuring indeed. Their consumption has been linked to a  reduced risk of all kinds of ailments, including Parkinson\u2019s disease, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, gallstones, depression, suicide, cirrhosis, liver cancer, melanoma and prostate cancer.\n In fact, in numerous studies conducted throughout the world, consuming four or five eight-ounce cups of coffee (or about 400 milligrams of caffeine) a day has been associated with reduced death rates . In a study of more than 200,000 participants followed for up to 30 years, those who drank three to five cups of coffee a day, with or without caffeine, were 15 percent  less likely to die early from all causes than were people who shunned coffee. Perhaps most dramatic was a 50 percent  reduction in the risk of suicide among both men and women who were moderate coffee drinkers, perhaps by boosting production of brain chemicals that have antidepressant effects.\n As  a report published last summer by a research team at the Harvard School of Public Health concluded, although current evidence may not warrant recommending coffee or caffeine to  prevent disease, for most people drinking coffee in moderation \u201ccan be part of a healthy lifestyle.\u201d\n It wasn\u2019t always thus. I\u2019ve lived through decades of sporadic warnings that coffee could be a health hazard. Over the years, coffee\u2019s been deemed a cause of conditions such as heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, pancreatic cancer, anxiety disorder, nutrient deficiencies, gastric reflux disease, migraine, insomnia, and premature death. As recently as 1991, the World Health Organization listed coffee as a possible carcinogen. In some of the now-discredited studies, smoking, not coffee drinking (the two often went hand-in-hand) was responsible for the purported hazard.\n \u201cThese periodic scares have given the public a very distorted view,\u201d said Dr. Walter C. Willett, professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cOverall, despite various concerns that have cropped up over the years, coffee is remarkably safe and has a number of important potential benefits.\u201d\n That\u2019s not to say coffee warrants a totally clean bill of health. Caffeine crosses the placenta into the fetus, and coffee drinking during pregnancy can increase the risk of miscarriage, low birth weight and premature birth. Pregnancy alters how the body metabolizes caffeine, and women who are pregnant or nursing are advised to abstain entirely, stick to decaf or at the very least limit their caffeine intake to less than 200 milligrams a day, the amount in about two standard cups of American coffee.\n The most common ill effect associated with caffeinated coffee is sleep disturbance. Caffeine locks into the same receptor in the brain as the neurotransmitter adenosine, a natural sedative. Dr. Willett, a co-author of the Harvard report, told me, \u201cI really do love coffee, but I have it only occasionally because otherwise I don\u2019t sleep very well. Lots of people with sleep problems don\u2019t recognize the connection to coffee.\u201d\n In  discussing his audiobook on caffeine with Terry Gross on NPR last winter, Michael Pollan called caffeine \u201cthe enemy of good sleep\u201d because it interferes with deep sleep. He confessed that after the challenging task of weaning himself from coffee, he \u201cwas sleeping like a teenager again.\u201d\n Dr. Willett, now 75, said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to get to zero consumption to minimize the impact on sleep,\u201d but he acknowledged that a person\u2019s sensitivity to caffeine \u201cprobably increases with age.\u201d People also vary widely in how rapidly they metabolize caffeine, enabling some to sleep soundly after drinking caffeinated coffee at dinner while others have trouble sleeping if they have coffee at lunch. But even if you can fall asleep readily after an evening coffee, it may disrupt your ability to get adequate deep sleep, Mr. Pollan states in his forthcoming book, \u201cThis Is Your Mind on Plants.\u201d\n Dr. Willett said it\u2019s possible to develop a degree of tolerance to caffeine\u2019s effect on sleep. My 75-year-old brother, an inveterate imbiber of caffeinated coffee, claims it has no effect on him. However, acquiring a tolerance to caffeine could blunt its benefit if, say, you wanted it to help you stay alert and focused while driving or taking a test.\n Caffeine is one of more than a thousand chemicals in coffee, not all of which are beneficial. Among others with positive effects are polyphenols and antioxidants. Polyphenols can inhibit the growth of cancer cells and lower the risk of Type 2 diabetes; antioxidants, which have anti-inflammatory effects, can counter both heart disease and cancer, the nation\u2019s leading killers.\n None of this means coffee is beneficial regardless of how it\u2019s prepared. When brewed without a paper filter, as in French press, Norwegian boiled coffee, espresso or Turkish coffee, oily chemicals called diterpenes come through that can raise artery-damaging LDL cholesterol. However, these chemicals are virtually absent in both filtered and instant coffee. Knowing I have a cholesterol problem, I dissected a coffee pod and found a paper filter lining the plastic cup. Whew!\n Also countering the potential health benefits of coffee are popular additions some people use, like cream and sweet syrups, that can convert this calorie-free beverage into a calorie-rich dessert. \u201cAll the things people put into coffee can result in a junk food with as many as 500 to 600 calories,\u201d Dr. Willett said. A 16-ounce  Starbucks Mocha Frappuccino, for example, has 51 grams of sugar, 15 grams of fat (10 of them saturated) and 370 calories.\n With iced coffee season approaching, more people are likely to turn to cold-brew coffee. Now rising in popularity, cold brew counters coffee\u2019s natural acidity and the bitterness that results when boiling water is poured over the grounds. Cold brew is made by  steeping the grounds in cold water for several hours, then straining the liquid through a paper filter to remove the grounds and harmful diterpenes and keep the flavor and caffeine for you to enjoy. Cold brew can also be made with decaffeinated coffee.\n Decaf is not totally without health benefits. As with caffeinated coffee, the polyphenols it contains have anti-inflammatory properties that may lower the risk of Type 2 diabetes and cancer.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 09:59:37", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5496\u5561,benefits", "title": "\u5496\u5561\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u76ca\u5904 ", "title_en": "The Health Benefits of Coffee", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/14/well/eat/coffee-health-benefits.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5496\u5561", "benefits"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "80354baa89ae69603cbfc4191b27b17f.jpg", "infoid": 1067879, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6839\u636e\u65b0\u95fb\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u67cf\u514b\u90e1\u54c8\u745f\u74e6\u5e2d\u8d1d\u65af\u5361\u5c14\u4e3b\u5e2d\u548c\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u5ba3\u5e03\u8f9e\u804c\uff0c\u5ba3\u5e03\uff0c\u8f9e\u804c\u662f\u8f9e\u804c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4f8b\u8349\u6848\u548c\u6885\u6797\u8fbe\u76d6\u8328\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u7684\u53d7\u6258\u4eba\u3002\n \u6bd4\u5c14\u548c\u6885\u7433\u8fbe\u76d6\u8328\u5ba3\u5e03\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e8e2021\u5e745\u6708\u8131\u843d\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bb8\u591a\u4eba\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7834\u788e\u7684\u516c\u544a\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5173\u4e8e\u4ed6\u4eec\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5168\u4e16\u754c\u7ed3\u675f\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u8ffd\u6c42\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u516c\u544a\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u50a8\u5b58\u4f17\u591a\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n \u8be5\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d44\u52a9\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u810a\u9ad3\u7070\u8d28\u708e\uff0c\u8425\u517b\uff0c\u519c\u4e1a\uff0c\u5168\u7403\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u536b\u751f\uff0c\u827e\u6ecb\u75c5\u6bd2\uff0c\u759f\u75be\uff0c\u70df\u8349\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u75ab\u82d7\uff0c\u6027\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49......\u548c\u6211\u4eec\u521a\u521a\u5165\u95e8\u3002\n \u5b83\uff06\uff0339;\u771f\u6b63\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u3002\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u4e8c\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u5df2\u7ecf\u53d1\u5c55\u5230\u8d85\u8fc71,600\u540d\u5458\u5de5\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7548\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u603b\u4ed8\u6b3e\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5b83\u5e76\u4e0d\u5938\u5f20\u5730\u8bf4\uff0c\u57fa\u7840\u662f\u5b8c\u5168\u6539\u53d8\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002\n  \u572890\u5c81\u65f6\uff0c\u81ea\u52a9\u9910\u6350\u8d60\u4e86\u4ef7\u503c410\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4f2f\u514b\u5e0c\u5c14\u80a1\u7968\u5230\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u3002\u5728\u4eca\u5929\u548c\u7b2c39\u9875\u7684\u516c\u544a\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ed6\u8865\u5145\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ed6\u6350\u8d60\u4e86\u989d\u5916\u768441\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u6ca1\u6709\u7ed9\u51fa\u4ed6\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002\n \uff06\uff0334;\u4eca\u5929\u662f\u6211\u7684\u91cc\u7a0b\u7891\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u5df4\u83f2\u7279\u5728\u4e00\u4efd\u58f0\u660e\u4e2d\u5199\u9053\u3002 \uff06\uff0334;\u57282006\u5e74\uff0c\u6211\u627f\u8bfa\u5206\u53d1\u6211\u6240\u6709\u7684\u4f2f\u514b\u5e0c\u5c14\u6d77\u745f\u8587\u80a1\u7968 - \u8d85\u8fc799\uff05\u7684\u51c0\u503c - \u6148\u5584\u4e8b\u4e1a\u3002\u968f\u7740\u4eca\u5929\u768441\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u6211\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\n \u5df4\u83f2\u7279\u4ece\u76d6\u8328\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u7684\u8f9e\u804c\u8f9e\u804c\u4e3a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u6bd4\u5c14\u76d6\u8328\u548c\u6885\u7433\u8fbe\u6cd5\u56fd\u5927\u95e8\u7684\u516c\u544a\u4e4b\u540e;\u79bb\u5a5a\u3002 \n\uff06\uff0334;\u591a\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u6211\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u6258\u4eba - \u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u6d3b\u52a8\u53d7\u52a9\u8005 - \u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u6536\u4ef6\u4eba\u7684\u8d44\u91d1\uff0c\u7968\u636e\u548cMelinda Gates\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\uff08BMG\uff09\u3002 \u6211\u73b0\u5728\u6b63\u5728\u8f9e\u804c\uff0c\u5c31\u50cf\u6211\u5728\u4f2f\u514b\u5e0c\u5c14\u4ee5\u5916\u7684\u6240\u6709\u516c\u53f8\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u6240\u505a\u7684\u90a3\u6837\uff0c\u201c\u5df4\u83f2\u7279\u8bf4\u3002 \u201cBMG\u7684\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u662fMark Suzman\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u8fd1\u671f\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u8c01\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u6211\u7684\u5168\u529b\u652f\u6301\u3002 \u6211\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u540c\u6b65100\uff05\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u8eab\u4f53\u53c2\u4e0e\u7edd\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76ee\u6807\u3002\uff06\uff0334;

For many, it was an earth-shattering announcement, one that raises a host of questions about the future of their foundation and its quest to end disease worldwide. This latest announcement adds to the growing number of questions about what&#39;s in store for the many enterprises currently being managed by the Gates Foundation.\n The foundation supplies grants to researchers studying polio, nutrition, agriculture, global education, sanitation, HIV, malaria, tobacco control, vaccines, gender inequality...and we&#39;re just getting started.\n It&#39;s a truly massive enterprise. The foundation has grown to over 1,600 employees over the last two decades and has issued total payments in excess of $54.8 billion, so it&#39;s not an overstatement to say that the foundation is quite literally transforming the world.\n  At the age of 90, Buffet has donated $41 billion worth of Berkshire stock to the five foundations. In today&#39;s announcement, he added that he has donated an extra $4.1 billion, but\u00a0he didn&#39;t give a reason for his decision.\n &#34;Today is a milestone for me,&#34; Buffett wrote in a statement. &#34;In 2006, I pledged to distribute all of my Berkshire Hathaway shares \u2014 more than 99% of my net worth \u2014 to philanthropy. With today\u2019s $4.1 billion distribution, I\u2019m halfway there.&#34;\n Buffett\u2019s resignation from the Gates Foundation board comes at an unprecedented time for the organization, especially following the announcement of founders Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates&#39; divorce.\n &#34;For years I have been a trustee \u2014 an inactive trustee at that \u2014 of only one recipient of my funds, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMG). I am now resigning from that post, just as I have done at all corporate boards other than Berkshire\u2019s,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cThe CEO of BMG is Mark Suzman, an outstanding recent selection who has my full support. My goals are 100% in sync with those of the foundation, and my physical participation is in no way needed to achieve these goals.&#34;\n  This is a breaking story and will be regularly updated as new information becomes available.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 09:16:07", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5df4\u83f2\u7279,\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a,buffett,\u8f9e\u804c", "title": "\u6c83\u4f26\u5df4\u83f2\u7279\u4ece\u6bd4\u5c14\u548c\u6885\u7433\u8fbe\u76d6\u8328\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u8f9e\u804c ", "title_en": "Warren Buffett Resigns From Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation", "transed": 1, "url": "https://interestingengineering.com/warren-buffett-resigns-from-bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5df4\u83f2\u7279", "\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a", "buffett", "\u8f9e\u804c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "efe63fc2d79fb2edfa85bf16a8739ee2.jpg", "infoid": 1067878, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8d77\u521d\uff0c\u4ece\u5bb6\u91cc\u5de5\u4f5c\u89c9\u5f97\u50cf\u9003\u8131\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e1c\u897f\u3002\u4eba\u4eec\u5728\u547c\u5524\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e3e\u884c\u4e00\u6b21\u6c57\u886b\u548c\u6324\u538b\u7684\u547c\u53eb\u4e2d\u6324\u538b\u65f6\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u6b22\u8fce\u3002\u901a\u52e4\u840e\u7f29\u548c\u67d4\u97e7\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u6ca1\u6709\u4eba\u62c5\u5fc3\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5348\u9910\u53c8\u4ece\u516c\u5171\u51b0\u7bb1\u91cc\u5077\u4e86\u3002\n \u7136\u540e\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e00\u5e74\u591a\u7684\u62e8\u53f7\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8367\u5149\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f00\u59cb\u62db\u624b\u3002\u5728\u4e1c\u5317\u548c\u897f\u90e8\u7684\u4e09\u4f4d\u6570\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u70ed\u6d6a\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u5458\u5de5\u5f00\u59cb\u6000\u7591\u8349\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u66f4\u73af\u4fdd\u7684 -

People rejoiced in taking meetings in sweatpants and squeezing in a load of laundry between calls. Commutes shrank and flexibility expanded. Nobody worried about their lunch being stolen from the communal fridge anymore.\n Then, after more than a year of dialing in, the physical office, in all its fluorescence, began to beckon.  After a  heat wave in the Northeast and  triple-digit temperatures in the West, some employees started to wonder if the grass might be greener \u2014 or, at least, the cubicle cooler \u2014 on the other side.\n \u201cI\u2019ve started going into work a few days a week to take advantage of the air-conditioning,\u201d said Courtney Walsh, a librarian at an intellectual property firm in Boston, whose third-floor apartment gets stiflingly hot.\n Ms. Walsh, 44, usually waits until July to install her window unit, but this year she cracked in early June, when she realized \u201cclutching the ice packs from my grocery delivery wasn\u2019t a long-term solution.\u201d Still, she said, while her modest A.C. takes the edge off, it\u2019s not as effective (or free) as her office\u2019s central air.\n \u201cI have to run it for hours before a meeting, which drives up my utility bill,\u201d she said. \u201cThen it\u2019s so loud while I\u2019m trying to talk that I have to turn it off. So then I\u2019m immediately sweating again.\u201d\n Globally, less than a third of households own an air-conditioner, according to  a 2018 report from the International Energy Agency. And even in countries like the United States, where almost 90 percent of homes have some kind of A.C., all that cooling doesn\u2019t come cheap.\n The U.S. government\u2019s most recent  Residential Energy Consumption Survey, completed in 2015, found that  Americans spend an average of $265 on air-conditioning annually. (For those in the hot-humid climate zone that stretches from Florida to southeastern Texas, that figure is closer to $525.)\n Earlier this year, Michelle Ozuna asked her boss if she could start going back into the office twice a week. While she loves the charm of her studio apartment in Anaheim, Calif., the building has no central air and the windows can barely keep out the heat.\n \u201cI\u2019ve got my portable air-conditioner on my left, a fan on my right, and I\u2019m still miserable,\u201d said Ms. Ozuna, 44, who works in human resources for a community college. \u201cI realized I really need to be in the office for my own sanity. I just want to be freezing again.\u201d\n Seeking the solace of air-conditioned spaces is nothing new, said Salvatore Basile, the author of \u201cCool: How Air-Conditioning Changed Everything.\u201d Though New York City\u2019s yellow cabs  weren\u2019t required to have A.C. until 1990, the city ran an experiment in the 1950s in which it put a fleet of 50 air-conditioned taxis on the streets, advertising their advantage with a bright blue sticker on the windshield.\n \u201cMany drivers reported that a large proportion of their rides came from people who actually didn\u2019t even want to go anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just wanted to be driven around a while to cool off.\u201d\n Still, when Willis Carrier \u2014 widely regarded as the inventor of modern air-conditioning \u2014 installed his \u201capparatus for treating air\u201d in 1902 in the Brooklyn printing plant where he worked, keeping his fellow employees comfortable wasn\u2019t top of mind.\n \u201cThe first attempts to cool buildings and factories were made to protect machinery and equipment, not to benefit people,\u201d Mr. Basile said. \u201cThe notion of \u2018comfort cooling,\u2019 as we know it, was actually a fairly late idea.\u201d\n The first high-rise air-conditioned office building in the United States \u2014 the 21-story Milam Building in San Antonio \u2014 didn\u2019t open until 1928, and even then it was something of an anomaly, Mr. Basile said.\n \u201cThe idea of installing air-conditioning in an office was expensive, and the ductwork took up a lot of space,\u201d he said. \u201cWorkers got nothing from management but awnings free of charge, and it was B.Y.O. electric fans.\u201d\n By 1951, the Empire State Building was air-conditioned, and in 1953, the Woolworth Building followed suit \u2014 though only in a third of its offices. When the Chrysler Building joined the party in 1954, \u201cit was becoming apparent that A.C. was a must in the modern American office,\u201d Mr. Basile said.\n  \u201cBefore Covid, you were usually at work during the dog days of summer, so you didn\u2019t realize how grim it could get at home,\u201d said Eileen Pozniak, a project manager who moved to London from New York 10 years ago.\n \u201cLast summer was awful because it was so hot and we couldn\u2019t go in at all,\u201d Ms. Pozniak, 38, said. \u201cNow I plan to go in as much as I can.\u201d\n John Tranfaglia, a 29-year-old policy analyst with the University of Michigan Health System, wishes he could do the same. His one wheezing window unit is fighting an uphill battle against the muggy Midwestern summer, but his team can\u2019t go back to the office until the fall.\n When he stopped by last month to grab a few things, the temperature hit him immediately. \u201cIt was so cold in there,\u201d Mr. Tranfaglia said. \u201cI was so envious.\u201d\n While nobody likes sticking to their seat through a meeting, discomfort isn\u2019t the only concern for workers sweating it out from home.\n \u201cIf I\u2019m shiny and flushed onscreen, I worry I don\u2019t seem as professional,\u201d said Rachel Bowles, a 37-year-old dietitian in Santa Clara, Calif. \u201cIt makes me feel like I have less authority.\u201d\n Even though her appointments are still virtual, she\u2019s been going into the office just so she can video chat from an air-conditioned space.\n \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on women, especially younger women, to look put together in order to be taken seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we\u2019re visibly sweaty, we can be perceived as nervous or frazzled.\u201d\n Kate O\u2019Berry, a 36-year-old analyst in New Bedford, Mass., also sees the office, and its consistently low temperatures, as a place where she feels most in control.\n \u201cIn my mind, I have Work Kate and Home Kate,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for the last year and a half, I\u2019ve had to be Work Kate at home, with all my messes and interruptions and distractions.\u201d Returning to her air-conditioned office \u201cmakes me feel normal,\u201d she said.\n Not everyone is excited about having a subsidized place to cool off. A  2015 study revealed that most office buildings set their temperatures based on  a formula developed in the 1960s that uses the metabolic rates of men \u2014 meaning plenty of employees find it far too cold for comfort.\n \u201cI\u2019m not looking forward to the A.C.-induced shivering again,\u201d said Emily Shields, 36, a content designer in Chicago, whose office thermostat is set so low that she\u2019s spent many a summer workday running her hands under the hot water in the bathroom just to get the feeling back.\n She and her husband have compromised on the air-conditioning while they both work from home. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten used to being able to work with a blanket on my lap whenever I need, including when I give important presentations,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sad that that will be going away.\u201d\n As for Ms. Walsh, she has already planned her next trip to the office for a brief reprieve from Boston\u2019s humidity. But even she recognizes the double-edged sword of the workplace A.C.\n \u201cIt\u2019s awful, and it\u2019s the best,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going back in again in a few days and I can\u2019t wait. I\u2019ll don my office cardigan after an hour or two, and it\u2019ll be bliss.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-24 09:14:49", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News",

", "note_en": "Peloton\u2019s Treadmills cost between $2,500 and $4,000. They\u2019ve also injured  70 people and killed  one child. Peloton issued a recall on the treadmills after an  investigation by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). Those who kept the Tread+ got a nasty shock in their inbox recently: After the treadmill downloaded an update Peloton said was designed to make the device safer, users reported they could no longer run on it without paying Peloton a $39.99 per month subscription fee.\n    \u201cWe care deeply about the safety and well being of our Members and we created Tread Lock to secure your Tread+ against unauthorized access,\u201d Peloton said in  an email it sent to customers. \u201cUnfortunately at this time \u2018Just Runn\u2019 is no longer accessible without a Peloton Membership.\u201d It offered to waive the subscription fee for the first three months and apologized for the inconvenience.   Peloton\u2019s subscription ecosystem provides users with live classes, crafted playlists, and customized tracks. For people who just want to run or bike, they can select the \u201cJust Bike\u201d or \u201cJust Run\u201d feature and use their devices like normal exercise equipment. Unless, of course, the user has updated the Tread+ to get the safety update.\n  After footage of children getting  injured on treadmills circulated online and CPSC issued its warning, Peloton founder CEO and founder John Foley released a  statement calling the warning \u201cmisleading and inaccurate.\u201d CSPC noted that the Pelton treadmill was uniquely dangerous because of its design, noting that its height off the ground and tread design caused objects and people to more easily slide under the machine.\n   \u201cWe design and build all of our products with safety in mind. But in order to help ensure that you and your family members stay safe with Peloton products in your home, we need your help,\u201d Foley said in his statement. He urged Tread+ users to make sure the space around the device was clear of pets and children and to lock the safety key up between uses. Peloton initially refused to issue a recall but relented after the CPSC issued its statement.\n  The new Tread Lock update adds another layer of safety to the Tread+. \u201cTread Lock is a safety feature that automatically locks the Peloton Tread+ after you put your Tread+ to sleep or after 45 seconds of inactivity outside of a class,\u201d Peloton  said on its website.\n  For now, the cost of using that new feature is, apparently, about $40 a month, though Peloton claimed it would not always be so. \u201cUnfortunately due to current technical limitations, Tread Lock is not yet available without a Peloton Membership,\u201d Peloton told Motherboard in an email. \u201cWe understand that this is an inconvenience for some and are working on updates to Tread Lock that will allow us to make Tread Lock and Just Run available without a Peloton Membership.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-24 08:30:42", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8dd1\u6b65\u673a,treadmill,peloton", "title": "Peloton\u8dd1\u6b65\u673a\u5b89\u5168\u66f4\u65b0\u9700\u8981\u6bcf\u670840\u7f8e\u5143\u8ba2\u9605 ", "title_en": "Peloton Treadmill Safety Update Requires $40 a Month Subscription", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.vice.com/en/article/4avnzg/peloton-treadmill-safety-update-requires-dollar40-a-month-subscription", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8dd1\u6b65\u673a", "treadmill", "peloton"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "2bb3c0bf4fcaa4278e6a56931e606f12.jpg", "infoid": 1067872, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5b54\u96c0\u53d1\u5c04\u8fd1\u4e00\u5e74\uff0cNBCuniversal\u7684Marquee Streaming\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ec8\u4e8e\u6765\u4e86\u7535\u89c6\u548c\u6d88\u9632\u7247\u3002\n Streaming Service\u5c06\u4e8e6\u670824\u65e5\u6b63\u5f0f\u5230\u8fbe\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u8bbf\u95ee\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u516c\u53f8\u5468\u4e09\u5ba3\u5e03\u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5c06\u5728\u6d88\u9632\u7535\u89c6\u4ea7\u54c1\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6d88\u9632\u7535\u89c6\u68d2\u7cbe\u7b80\uff0c\u706b\u7535\u89c6\u68d24K\u548c\u706b\u7535\u89c6\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u89c6\u3002\u5b54\u96c0\u53d1\u8a00\u4eba\u544a\u8bc9\u8fb9\u7f18\uff0c\u5373\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4ee3\u706b\u7535\u89c6\u53ca\u4ee5\u4e0a\u5c06\u6709\u652f\u6301\u8be5\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u5e26\u6709\u6d88\u9632OS 5\u53ca\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u6d88\u9632\u7247\u3002\n \u9664\u5b54\u96c0\u5916\uff0c\u5206\u9500\u534f\u8bae\u8fd8\u5c06\u770b\u523015\u4e2aNBCuniversal Apps\u8fd8\u7ed9\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5404\u79cdNBC\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548cTelemundo\u3002\u5b54\u96c0\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u662f\u514d\u8d39\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4efb\u4f55\u4e00\u4e2a\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u4ed8\u8d39\u5c42\u89e3\u9501\u66f4\u591a\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u539f\u4ef6\u3002\u5b54\u96c0\u7684\u4f18\u8d28\u5e7f\u544a\u652f\u6301\u7684\u4e00\u5c42\u6bcf\u6708\u8017\u8d395\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u5e7f\u544a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6bcf\u670810\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n \u652f\u6301\u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u652f\u6301\u5c06\u4f7f\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bbf\u95eeNBCuniversal\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u7f16\u7a0b\u76ee\u5f55 -

The companies announced Wednesday that the app would be supported across Fire TV products, including Fire TV Stick Lite, Fire TV Stick 4K, and Fire TV smart TVs. A Peacock spokesperson told  The Verge that second-generation Fire TVs and above will have support for the app, as will all Fire Tablets with Fire OS 5 and above.\n In addition to Peacock, the distribution agreement will see 15 NBCUniversal apps arrive on Amazon devices as well, including various NBC apps and Telemundo. Much of Peacock\u2019s content is available to stream for free, but users can unlock more content and originals with either of the service\u2019s paid tiers. Peacock\u2019s premium ad-supported tier costs $5 per month, while its ad-free experience costs $10 per month.\n Support for the app will give streamers access not only to NBCUniversal\u2019s catalog of network programming \u2014 including popular series like  The Office,  30 Rock, and  Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit \u2014 but also to coverage of various sporting events. These include Sunday Night Football, the Tokyo Olympics, and, because Peacock has  exclusive rights to the WWE Network, SummerSlam.\n Previously, Fire TV users who\u2019d hoped to access event coverage exclusive to the service would either have to find another way to stream it or sideload it themselves \u2014 something Peacock itself  previously encouraged its frustrated users to try as a workaround.\n When support arrives tomorrow, Fire TV users will be able to open and search the service\u2019s catalog using voice commands. The companies said that later this year, users will get further Alexa support and the ability to surf Peacock using an Alexa Voice Remote, a Fire TV Cube, or by pairing an Echo device to a Fire TV

", "note_en": "Retired New Zealand weightlifter and former Olympian Tracey Lambrechs warned Thursday that transgender athletes will eventually \u201cknock women out of sport\u201d unless action is taken.\n Lambrechs competed in the same weight class as transgender athlete Laurel Hubbard after Hubbard, born biologically male, transitioned in 2013 and began competing in women\u2019s weightlifting competitions. Lambrechs said she lost all of her weightlifting records soon after Hubbard began competing.\n \u201cI was like \u2018What do you mean? There\u2019s no one that\u2019s close to me,\u2019\u201d Lambrechs said during an interview with  Fox News, recalling a phone call she received from her coach letting her know that Hubbard had eclipsed her lifting records and beat her out of the number one spot for their weight class. \u201cLaurel started weightlifting, and she competed on the weekend. So as of now, you\u2019re number two.\u201d\n Hubbard is set to  become the first openly transgender person to compete in the Olympics after winning a spot on the New Zealand national team. At 43 years old, Hubbard is currently the oldest weightlifter competing.\n Lambrechs said that trans athletes could eventually destroy women\u2019s sports by forcing out all biologically female competitors.\n  \u201cIt\u2019s honestly going to knock women out of sport. Women are not going to want to participate in something where there isn\u2019t opportunity for them to win medals or go to international competition,\u201d she said.\n After Hubbard beat Lambrechs out of her records, Lambrechs was given little recourse if she wanted to continue competing.\n \u201cI was told by the national weightlifting body that I either needed to drop a weight category or look at retiring,\u201d Lambrechs said. Lambrechs ultimately decided to drop a weight class so that she could continue competing.\n  Each nation is capped at sending just one athlete per weight class for major weightlifting competitions. Lambrechs lost nearly 40 pounds in three months to drop weight classes and continue competing.\n \u201cI just did what I had to do to accomplish my goal of competing at my third Commonwealth Games. It meant a lot to me to show the Commonwealth that I wasn\u2019t knocked out that easily,\u201d Lambrechs said.\n Lambrechs has previously  claimed that athletes have been warned to be silent about transgender competitors in women\u2019s sports. In May, she said that sport was being taken away from women because of committees allowing biological men to compete against them.\n  \u201cI\u2019m quite disappointed, quite disappointed for the female athlete who will lose out on that spot,\u201d Lambrechs said. \u201cWe\u2019re all about equality for women in sport, but right now that equality is being taken away from us.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve had female weightlifters come up to me and say, \u2018What do we do? This isn\u2019t fair, what do we do?\u2019 Unfortunately, there\u2019s nothing we can do because every time we voice it we get told to be quiet,\u201d she added.\n  The Daily Wire is one of America\u2019s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

Thanks to this reconstruction, we can now see that the composition as it was painted by Rembrandt was even more dynamic,&#34; Rijksmuseum director Taco Dibbits said.\n &#34;It is wonderful to be able to now see with our own eyes The Night Watch as Rembrandt intended it to be seen.&#34;\n   The Night Watch is considered Rembrandt&#39;s most ambitious work. It was commissioned by the mayor and leader of the civic guard of Amsterdam, Frans Banninck Cocq, who wanted a group portrait of his militia company.\n Prior to the restoration the painting was nearly 4m tall and 4.5m wide (12.5 x 15 ft) and weighed 337kg (743lb). As well as being famous for its size, the piece is acclaimed for its use of dramatic lighting and movement.\n In 1975, a man armed with a bread knife fought off a museum guard and slashed the painting, telling bystanders that he &#34;did it for the Lord&#34;.\n The piece was also attacked with a knife in 1911 and sprayed with a chemical in 1990, but only minor damage occurred on both occasions that was relatively easy to repair.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 07:44:38", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e,helps,\u73b0\u5728", "title":

", "note_en": "Where does your enterprise stand on the AI adoption curve? Take our  AI survey to find out.\n Adobe has launched  Substance 3D tools that take advantage of AI technology for immersive creation.\n The tools are aimed at making more realistic special effects, gaming, and entertainment imagery. They are also targeted at wider industries that similarly require a precision realism in design, said Sebastien Deguy (the vice president of 3D and immersive at Adobe) in an interview with GamesBeat.\n  \u201cTwo-and-a-half years ago, my company [Allegorithmic] was acquired to do 3D and immersive design,\u201d Deguy said. \u201cWe created this new division called 3D immersive. And the goal for this division is to provide a set of\u00a0 ecosystem of applications from Adobe for the 3d community, including game developers. It\u2019s for the studios we currently serve with our software products but also the new designers who are interested in 3D.\u201d\n Adobe acquired  Allegorithmic because of the potential it saw in the future of 3D technology. Since then, Adobe has been working on expanding Substance 3D.\n  \u201cCreators and designers in other industries beyond the game industry are adopting these game technologies,\u201d Deguy said. \u201cThere is a lot of room to grow. Most of the actual 3D tools are really complex and complicated to learn. Our tools are really well defined and easy to get into. We\u2019re trying to make it more accessible.\u201d\n But Adobe isn\u2019t making toys, either. It is targeting a new generation of designers who are just starting to use 3D in their processes. Substance 3D uses artificial intelligence to eliminate much of the technical complexity of 3D design and features the \u201cwhat you see is what you get\u201d interface artists know from  Photoshop\u00a0or\u00a0 Illustrator. And the collection isn\u2019t just about tools \u2014 it also includes thousands of models, textures, lighting systems, and other assets designers can use to jump-start projects.\n One of the main concerns of 3D artists and designers today \u2014 whether in game development, VFX, or product design \u2014 is that the design process is really fragmented. They need to jump between various tools as part of their workflows. The Adobe Substance 3D Collection was designed to connect seamlessly with Adobe Creative Cloud in order to drastically help streamline this process, allowing 3D artists to switch between Substance, Photoshop, InDesign, and more. Also, Adobe says this will help creatives curious about 3D quickly adopt and learn the tools because they are accustomed to the interface and the Creative Cloud, Deguy said.\n   Substance 3D includes four new tools and an expanded ecosystem, including an expanded library of thousands of customizable 3D assets.\n Deguy said that the tool can be used in industries like architecture, fashion, food/beverage, and more. The tool can easily be integrated into design processes, regardless of experience level, he said.\n One of the new tools is Stager, which can assemble 3D models, materials, and lighting in a 3D scene and produce virtual photography. It gets a big boost from machine learning, Deguy said.\n   The third tool is Modeler, which will soon be available for private beta. Modeler connects virtual reality and desktop for a more immersive design process and organic sculpting.\n And the last tool is the 3D Asset Library, an expanded library of thousands of customizable 3D assets to feed creatives\u2019 workflow. The toolkit also provides access to Creative Cloud\u2019s fonts library, storage, and more.\n One example where the tools are useful is virtual photography.\u00a0Due to the pandemic, most brands/companies had to discontinue all photo or video shoots. By generating photorealistic renderings of products, companies like  Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s save time and money while creating lifelike images for marketing, promotion, and other uses.\n  Rival solutions come from Autodesk, Unity, and Unreal. The Substance 3D tools are interoperable with a lot of the competition, though, as standards such as Pixar\u2019s Universal Scene Description (USD) are spreading through simulation tools such as  Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse, Deguy said.\n Guido Quaroni is the director of engineering and 3D immersive at Adobe, but before that, he was at Pixar, where he was responsible for open-sourcing USD.  In a panel at the 2021 GPU Technology Conference (GTC), he said the idea of USD emerged at Pixar in 2010 as the company was dealing with multiple libraries that dealt with large scenes in its movies.\n  \u201cSome of the ideas in USD go back 20 years to  Toy Story 2, but the idea was to formalize it and write it in a way that we could eventually open source it,\u201d Quaroni said on my panel at GTC 2021.\n  Deguy said, \u201cWe want to make sure that we connect our teams and they talk to each other. And one of the things also that will help new designers to get into our offering is the fact that we will connect normally to the Omniverse and the Unity companies of this world, but also Photoshop and Illustrator and all the Create tools. We\u2019re at the same company, so we can connect.\u201d\n GamesBeat&#39;s creed when covering the game industry is &#34;where passion meets business.&#34; What does this mean?

", "note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  In  mathematical logic and  computer science,  homotopy type theory ( HoTT    /  h \u0252 t/) refers to various lines of development of  intuitionistic type theory, based on the interpretation of types as objects to which the intuition of (abstract)  homotopy theory applies.\n This includes, among other lines of work, the construction of homotopical and  higher-categorical  models for such type theories; the use of type theory as a logic (or  internal language) for abstract homotopy theory and  higher category theory; the development of mathematics within a type-theoretic  foundation (including both previously existing mathematics and new mathematics that homotopical types make possible); and the  formalization of each of these in computer  proof assistants.\n There is a large overlap between the work referred to as homotopy type theory, and as the  univalent foundations project. Although neither is precisely delineated, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, the choice of usage also sometimes corresponds to differences in viewpoint and emphasis.  [1] As such, this article may not represent the views of all researchers in the fields equally. This kind of variability is unavoidable when a field is in rapid flux.\n    At one time the idea that types in  intensional type theory with their identity types could be regarded as  groupoids was  mathematical folklore. It was first made precise semantically in the 1998 paper of Martin Hofmann and  Thomas Streicher called &#34;The groupoid interpretation of type theory&#34;, in which they showed that intensional type theory had a model in the category of  groupoids.  [2] This was the first truly &#34; homotopical&#34; model of type theory, albeit only &#34;1- dimensional&#34; (the traditional models in the  category of sets being homotopically 0-dimensional).\n Their paper also foreshadowed several later developments in homotopy type theory. For instance, they noted that the groupoid model satisfies a rule they called &#34;universe extensionality&#34;, which is none other than the restriction to 1-types of the  univalence axiom that  Vladimir Voevodsky proposed ten years later. (The axiom for 1-types is notably simpler to formulate, however, since a  coherent notion of &#34;equivalence&#34; is not required.) They also defined &#34;categories with isomorphism as equality&#34; and conjectured that in a model using higher-dimensional groupoids, for such categories one would have &#34;equivalence is equality&#34;; this was later proven by Benedikt Ahrens, Krzysztof Kapulkin, and  Michael Shulman.  [3]\n  The first higher-dimensional models of intensional type theory were constructed by  Steve Awodey and his student Michael Warren in 2005 using  Quillen model categories. These results were first presented in public at the conference FMCS 2006  [4] at which Warren gave a talk titled &#34;Homotopy models of intensional type theory&#34;, which also served as his thesis prospectus (the dissertation committee present were Awodey, Nicola Gambino and Alex Simpson). A summary is contained in Warren&#39;s thesis prospectus abstract.  [5]\n At a subsequent workshop about identity types at  Uppsala University in 2006  [6] there were two talks about the relation between intensional type theory and factorization systems: one by Richard Garner, &#34;Factorisation systems for type theory&#34;,  [7] and one by Michael Warren, &#34;Model categories and intensional identity types&#34;. Related ideas were discussed in the talks by Steve Awodey, &#34;Type theory of higher-dimensional categories&#34;, and  Thomas Streicher, &#34;Identity types vs. weak omega-groupoids: some ideas, some problems&#34;. At the same conference Benno van den Berg gave a talk titled &#34;Types as weak omega-categories&#34; where he outlined the ideas that later became the subject of a joint paper with Richard Garner.\n All early constructions of higher dimensional models had to deal with the problem of coherence typical of models of dependent type theory, and various solutions were developed. One such was given in 2009 by Voevodsky, another in 2010 by van den Berg and Garner.  [8] A general solution, building on Voevodsky&#39;s construction, was eventually given by Lumsdaine and Warren in 2014.  [9]\n At the PSSL86 in 2007  [10] Awodey gave a talk titled &#34;Homotopy type theory&#34; (this was the first public usage of that term, which was coined by Awodey  [11]). Awodey and Warren summarized their results in the paper &#34;Homotopy theoretic models of identity types&#34;, which was posted on the  ArXiv preprint server in 2007  [12] and published in 2009; a more detailed version appeared in Warren&#39;s thesis &#34;Homotopy theoretic aspects of constructive type theory&#34; in 2008.\n At about the same time, Vladimir Voevodsky was independently investigating type theory in the context of the search of a language for practical formalization of mathematics. In September 2006 he posted to the Types mailing list &#34;A very short note on homotopy  lambda calculus&#34;,  [13] which sketched the outlines of a type theory with dependent products, sums and universes and of a model of this type theory in Kan  simplicial sets. It began by saying &#34;The homotopy \u03bb-calculus is a hypothetical (at the moment) type system&#34; and ended with &#34;At the moment much of what I said above is at the level of conjectures. Even the definition of the model of TS in the homotopy category is non-trivial&#34; referring to the complex coherence issues that were not resolved until 2009. This note included a syntactic definition of &#34;equality types&#34; that were claimed to be interpreted in the model by path-spaces, but did not consider  Per Martin-L\u00f6f&#39;s rules for identity types. It also stratified the universes by homotopy dimension in addition to size, an idea that later was mostly discarded.\n On the syntactic side, Benno van den Berg conjectured in 2006 that the tower of identity types of a type in intensional type theory should have the structure of an \u03c9-category, and indeed a \u03c9-groupoid, in the &#34;globular, algebraic&#34; sense of Michael Batanin. This was later proven independently by van den Berg and Garner in the paper &#34;Types are weak omega-groupoids&#34; (published 2008),  [14] and by Peter Lumsdaine in the paper &#34;Weak \u03c9-Categories from Intensional Type Theory&#34; (published 2009) and as part of his 2010 Ph.D. thesis &#34;Higher Categories from Type Theories&#34;.  [15]\n  The concept of a univalent fibration was introduced by Voevodsky in early 2006.  [16]However, because of the insistence of all presentations of the Martin-L\u00f6f type theory on the property that the identity types, in the empty context, may contain only reflexivity, Voevodsky did not recognize until 2009 that these identity types can be used in combination with the univalent universes. In particular, the idea that univalence can be introduced simply by adding an axiom to the existing Martin-L\u00f6f type theory appeared only in 2009.\n Also in 2009, Voevodsky worked out more of the details of a model of type theory in  Kan complexes, and observed that the existence of a universal  Kan fibration could be used to resolve the coherence problems for categorical models of type theory. He also proved, using an idea of A. K. Bousfield, that this universal fibration was univalent: the associated fibration of pairwise homotopy equivalences between the fibers is equivalent to the paths-space fibration of the base.\n To formulate univalence as an axiom Voevodsky found a way to define &#34;equivalences&#34; syntactically that had the important property that the type representing the statement &#34;f is an equivalence&#34; was (under the assumption of function extensionality) (-1)-truncated (i.e. contractible if inhabited). This enabled him to give a  syntactic statement of univalence, generalizing Hofmann and Streicher&#39;s &#34;universe extensionality&#34; to higher dimensions. He was also able to use these definitions of equivalences and contractibility to start developing significant amounts of &#34;synthetic homotopy theory&#34; in the proof assistant  Coq; this formed the basis of the library later called &#34;Foundations&#34; and eventually &#34;UniMath&#34;.  [17]\n Unification of the various threads began in February 2010 with an informal meeting at  Carnegie Mellon University, where Voevodsky presented his model in Kan complexes and his Coq code to a group including Awodey, Warren, Lumsdaine, and  Robert Harper, Dan Licata,  Michael Shulman, and others. This meeting produced the outlines of a proof (by Warren, Lumsdaine, Licata, and Shulman) that every homotopy equivalence is an equivalence (in Voevodsky&#39;s good coherent sense), based on the idea from category theory of improving equivalences to adjoint equivalences. Soon afterwards, Voevodsky proved that the univalence axiom implies function extensionality.\n The next pivotal event was a mini-workshop at the  Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach in March 2011 organized by Steve Awodey, Richard Garner, Per Martin-L\u00f6f, and Vladimir Voevodsky, titled &#34;The homotopy interpretation of constructive type theory&#34;.  [18] As part of a Coq tutorial for this workshop, Andrej Bauer wrote a small Coq library  [19] based on Voevodsky&#39;s ideas (but not actually using any of his code); this eventually became the kernel of the first version of the &#34;HoTT&#34; Coq library  [20] (the first commit of the latter  [21] by Michael Shulman notes &#34;Development based on Andrej Bauer&#39;s files, with many ideas taken from Vladimir Voevodsky&#39;s files&#34;). One of the most important things to come out of the Oberwolfach meeting was the basic idea of higher inductive types, due to Lumsdaine, Shulman, Bauer, and Warren. The participants also formulated a list of important open questions, such as whether the univalence axiom satisfies canonicity (still open, although some special cases have been resolved positively  [22]  [23]), whether the univalence axiom has nonstandard models (since answered positively by Shulman), and how to define (semi)simplicial types (still open in MLTT, although it can be done in Voevodsky&#39;s Homotopy Type System (HTS), a type theory with two equality types).\n Soon after the Oberwolfach workshop, the  Homotopy Type Theory website and blog  [24] was established, and the subject began to be popularized under that name. An idea of some of the important progress during this period can be obtained from the blog history.  [25]\n  The phrase &#34;univalent foundations&#34; is agreed by all to be closely related to homotopy type theory, but not everyone uses it in the same way. It was originally used by Vladimir Voevodsky to refer to his vision of a foundational system for mathematics in which the basic objects are homotopy types, based on a type theory satisfying the univalence axiom, and formalized in a computer proof assistant.  [26]\n As Voevodsky&#39;s work became integrated with the community of other researchers working on homotopy type theory, &#34;univalent foundations&#34; was sometimes used interchangeably with &#34;homotopy type theory&#34;,  [27] and other times to refer only to its use as a foundational system (excluding, for example, the study of model-categorical semantics or computational metatheory).  [28] For instance, the subject of the IAS special year was officially given as &#34;univalent foundations&#34;, although a lot of the work done there focused on semantics and metatheory in addition to foundations. The book produced by participants in the IAS program was titled &#34;Homotopy type theory: Univalent foundations of mathematics&#34;; although this could refer to either usage, since the book only discusses HoTT as a mathematical foundation.  [27]\n   In 2012\u201313 researchers at the  Institute for Advanced Study held &#34;A Special Year on Univalent Foundations of Mathematics&#34;.  [29] The special year brought together researchers in  topology,  computer science,  category theory, and  mathematical logic. The program was organized by  Steve Awodey,  Thierry Coquand and  Vladimir Voevodsky.\n During the program  Peter Aczel, who was one of the participants, initiated a working group which investigated how to do type theory informally but rigorously, in a style that is analogous to ordinary mathematicians doing set theory. After initial experiments it became clear that this was not only possible but highly beneficial, and that a book (the so-called  HoTT Book)  [27]  [30] could and should be written. Many other participants of the project then joined the effort with technical support, writing, proof reading, and offering ideas. Unusually for a mathematics text, it was developed collaboratively and in the open on  GitHub, is released under a  Creative Commons license that allows people to  fork their own version of the book, and is both purchasable in print and downloadable free of charge.  [31]  [32]  [33]\n  More generally, the special year was a catalyst for the development of the entire subject; the HoTT Book was only one, albeit the most visible, result.\n   ACM Computing Reviews listed the book as a notable 2013 publication in the category &#34;mathematics of computing&#34;.  [34]\n  dependent type            x  :  A  \u00a0  \u22a2  \u00a0  B  (  x  )  \u00a0    {\\displaystyle x:A\\ \\vdash \\ B(x)\\ }\n   \u03b1  :      I  d         I  d     A    (  a  ,  b  )    (  p  ,  q  )    {\\displaystyle \\alpha :\\mathrm {Id} _{\\mathrm {Id} _{A}(a,b)}(p,q)}\n  HoTT uses a modified version of the &#34; propositions as types&#34; interpretation of type theory, according to which types can also represent propositions and terms can then represent proofs. In HoTT, however, unlike in standard &#34;propositions as types&#34;, a special role is played by &#39;mere propositions&#39; which, roughly speaking, are those types having at most one term, up to  propositional equality. These are more like conventional logical propositions than are general types, in that they are proof-irrelevant.\n  The fundamental concept of homotopy type theory is the  path. In HoTT, the type            a  =  b    {\\displaystyle a=b}   is the type of all paths from the point            a    {\\displaystyle a}   to the point            b    {\\displaystyle b}  . (Therefore, a proof that a point            a    {\\displaystyle a}   equals a point            b    {\\displaystyle b}   is the same thing as a path from the point            a    {\\displaystyle a}   to the point            b    {\\displaystyle b}  .) For any point            a    {\\displaystyle a}  , there exists a path of type            a  =  a    {\\displaystyle a=a}  , corresponding to the reflexive property of equality. A path of type            a  =  b    {\\displaystyle a=b}   can be inverted, forming a path of type            b  =  a    {\\displaystyle b=a}  , corresponding to the symmetric property of equality. Two paths of type            a  =  b    {\\displaystyle a=b}   resp.            b  =  c    {\\displaystyle b=c}   can be concatenated, forming a path of type            a  =  c    {\\displaystyle a=c}  ; this corresponds to the transitive property of equality.\n Most importantly, given a path            p  :  a  =  b    {\\displaystyle p:a=b}  , and a proof of some property            P  (  a  )    {\\displaystyle P(a)}  , the proof can be &#34;transported&#34; along the path            p    {\\displaystyle p}   to yield a proof of the property            P  (  b  )    {\\displaystyle P(b)}  . (Equivalently stated, an object of type            P  (  a  )    {\\displaystyle P(a)}   can be turned into an object of type            P  (  b  )    {\\displaystyle P(b)}  .) This corresponds to  the substitution property of equality. Here, an important difference between HoTT and classical mathematics comes in. In classical mathematics, once the equality of two values            a    {\\displaystyle a}   and            b    {\\displaystyle b}   has been established,            a    {\\displaystyle a}   and            b    {\\displaystyle b}   may be used interchangeably thereafter, with no regard to any distinction between them. In homotopy type theory, however, there may be multiple different paths            a  =  b    {\\displaystyle a=b}  , and transporting an object along two different paths will yield two different results. Therefore, in homotopy type theory, when applying the substitution property, it is necessary to state which path is being used.\n In general, a &#34;proposition&#34; can have multiple different proofs. (For example, the type of all natural numbers, when considered as a proposition, has every natural number as a proof.) Even if a proposition has only one proof            a    {\\displaystyle a}  , the space of paths            a  =  a    {\\displaystyle a=a}   may be non-trivial in some way. A &#34;mere proposition&#34; is any type which either is empty, or contains only one point with a trivial  path space.\n Note that people write            a  =  b    {\\displaystyle a=b}   for            I    d    A    (  a  ,  b  )    {\\displaystyle Id_{A}(a,b)}  , thereby leaving the type            A    {\\displaystyle A}   of            a  ,  b    {\\displaystyle a,b}   implicit. Do not confuse it with            i    d    A    :  A  \u2192  A    {\\displaystyle id_{A}:A\\to A}  , denoting the identity function on            A    {\\displaystyle A}  .\n  Two types            A    {\\displaystyle A}   and            B    {\\displaystyle B}   belonging to some universe            U    {\\displaystyle U}   are defined as being  equivalent if there exists an  equivalence between them. An equivalence is a function\n  which has both a left inverse and a right inverse, in the sense that for suitably chosen            g    {\\displaystyle g}   and            h    {\\displaystyle h}  , the following types are both inhabited:\n I    d    B  \u2192  B    (  f  \u2218  g  ,  i    d    B    )  ,    {\\displaystyle Id_{B\\rightarrow B}(f\\circ g,id_{B}),}\n I    d    A  \u2192  A    (  h  \u2218  f  ,  i    d    A    )  .    {\\displaystyle Id_{A\\rightarrow A}(h\\circ f,id_{A}).}\n  f  \u2218  g    =    B  \u2192  B    i    d    B    ,    {\\displaystyle f\\circ g=_{B\\rightarrow B}id_{B},}\n h  \u2218  f    =    A  \u2192  A    i    d    A    .    {\\displaystyle h\\circ f=_{A\\rightarrow A}id_{A}.}\n This expresses a general notion of &#34;           f    {\\displaystyle f}   has both a left inverse and right inverse&#34;, using equality types. Note that the invertibility conditions above are equality types in the function types            A  \u2192  A    {\\displaystyle A\\rightarrow A}   and            B  \u2192  B    {\\displaystyle B\\rightarrow B}  . One generally assumes the function extensionality axiom, which ensures that these are equivalent to the following types that express invertibility using the equality on the domain and codomain            A    {\\displaystyle A}   and            B    {\\displaystyle B}  :\n \u03a0    y  :  B    .  \u00a0  I    d    B    (  (  f  \u2218  g  )  (  y  )  ,  i    d    B    (  y  )  )  ,    {\\displaystyle \\Pi _{y:B}.\\ Id_{B}((f\\circ g)(y),id_{B}(y)),}\n \u03a0    x  :  A    .  \u00a0  I    d    A    (  (  h  \u2218  f  )  (  x  )  ,  i    d    A    (  x  )  )  .    {\\displaystyle \\Pi _{x:A}.\\ Id_{A}((h\\circ f)(x),id_{A}(x)).}\n i.e. for all            x  :  A    {\\displaystyle x:A}   and            y  :  B    {\\displaystyle y:B}  ,\n       Having defined functions that are equivalences as above, one can show that there is a canonical way to turn paths to equivalences.In other words, there is a function of the type\n (  A  =  B  )  \u2192  (  A  \u2243  B  )  ,    {\\displaystyle (A=B)\\to (A\\simeq B),}\n which expresses that types            A  ,  B    {\\displaystyle A,B}   that are equal are, in particular, also equivalent.\n  (  A  =  B  )  \u2243  (  A  \u2243  B  )    {\\displaystyle (A=B)\\simeq (A\\simeq B)}\n &#34;In other words, identity is equivalent to equivalence. In particular, one may say that &#39;equivalent types are identical&#39;.&#34;  [27] : 4\n   HoTT a\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-24 07:42:47", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7406\u8bba,type,\u7c7b\u578b", "title": "\u540c\u578b\u578b\u7406\u8bba ", "title_en": "Homotopy Type Theory", "transed": 1, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_type_theory", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7406\u8bba", "type", "\u7c7b\u578b"]}]
