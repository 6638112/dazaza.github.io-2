But mysteries still remain.</p><p>科学家花了375年的时间才发现世界第八大大陆，而该大陆一直隐藏在人们的视野中。但谜团仍然存在。</p><p> It was 1642 and Abel Tasman was on a mission. The experienced Dutch sailor, who sported a flamboyant moustache, bushy goatee and penchant for rough justice – he later tried to hang some of his crew on a drunken whim – was confident of the existence of a vast continent in the southern hemisphere, and determined to find it.</p><p> 那是1642年，亚伯塔斯曼（Abel Tasman）正在执行任务。这位经验丰富的荷兰水手满是花哨的胡须，浓密的山羊胡子和对粗暴正义的嗜好-后来他试图将一些船员吊在醉酒的心血来潮中-对南半球的广阔大陆充满信心，并决心找到它。</p><p> At the time, this portion of the globe was still largely mysterious to Europeans, but they had an unshakeable belief that there must be a large land mass there – pre-emptively named  Terra Australis – to balance out their own continent in the North. The fixation dated back to Ancient  Roman times, but only now was it going to be tested.</p><p> 当时，地球的这一部分对欧洲人来说仍然基本上是个神秘的事物，但是他们坚信，那里一定有一块巨大的土地-优先命名为Terra Australis-以平衡他们在北方的大陆。这种注视可以追溯到古罗马时代，但直到现在才需要进行测试。</p><p> And so, on 14 August, Tasman set sail from his company&#39;s base in Jakarta, Indonesia, with two small ships and headed west, then south, then east, eventually ending up at the South Island of New Zealand. His first encounter with the local Māori people did not go well: on day two, several  paddled out on a canoe, and rammed a small boat that was passing messages between the Dutch ships. Four Europeans died. Later, the Europeans fired a cannon at 11 more canoes – it’s not known what happened to their targets.</p><p> 因此，在8月14日，塔斯曼带着两艘小船从他公司在印度尼西亚雅加达的基地起航，向西，然后向南，然后向东，最后到达了新西兰的南岛。他与当地毛利人的第一次交往并不顺利：第二天，有几人划着独木舟划船，撞上了一条在荷兰船只之间传递信息的小船。四名欧洲人死亡。后来，欧洲人向另外11艘独木舟发射了一门大炮-目前还不清楚他们的目标发生了什么。</p><p> And that was the end of his mission – Tasman named the fateful location  Moordenaers (Murderers) Bay, with little sense of irony, and sailed home several weeks later without even having set foot on this new land. While he believed that he had indeed  discovered the great southern continent, evidently, it was hardly the commercial utopia he had envisaged. He did not return.</p><p> 这就是他任务的终点–塔斯曼几乎没有讽刺意味地将命运定为命运的地点Moordenaers（Murderers）湾，几周后甚至没有踏上这片新大陆就回家了。虽然他相信自己确实已经发现了南部大大陆，但显然，这并不是他所设想的商业乌托邦。他没有回来。</p><p> (By this time, Australia was already known about, but the Europeans thought it was not the legendary continent they were  looking for. Later, it was named after  Terra Australis when they  changed their minds).</p><p> （这一次，澳大利亚已经广为人知，但欧洲人认为这并不是他们想要的传奇大陆。后来，当他们改变主意时，它以Terra Australis的名字命名）。</p><p>  In 2017, a group of geologists  hit the headlines when they  announced their discovery of Zealandia – Te Riu-a-Māui in the Māori language. A vast continent of 1.89 million sq miles (4.9 million sq km) it is around six times the size of Madagascar.</p><p>  2017年，一群地质学家登上头条新闻，他们以毛利语宣布发现西兰德西亚人-TeRiu-a-Māui。 189万平方英里（490万平方公里）的广阔大陆，是马达加斯加的六倍。 </p><p> Though the world&#39;s encyclopaedias, maps and search engines had been adamant that there are just seven continents for some time, the team confidently informed the world that this was wrong. There are eight after all – and the latest addition breaks all the records, as the smallest, thinnest, and youngest in the world. The catch is that 94% of it is underwater, with just a handful of islands, such as New Zealand, thrusting out from its oceanic depths. It had been hiding in plain sight all along.</p><p>尽管全世界的百科全书，地图和搜索引擎一直坚称一段时间内只有七个大洲，但该团队自信地告诉世界这是错误的。毕竟有八种，而最新的则打破了所有记录，成为世界上最小，最薄和最年轻的唱片。渔获物是它的94％是在水下，只有少数几个岛屿（例如新西兰）从其海洋深处伸出来。一直隐藏在它的视线中。</p><p> &#34;This is an example of how something very obvious can take a while to uncover,&#34; says Andy Tulloch, a geologist at the New Zealand Crown Research Institute GNS Science, who was part of the team that discovered Zealandia.</p><p> ＆＃34;这是一个示例，说明很明显的事情可能要花一些时间才能发现，＆＃34;新西兰皇冠研究所GNS Science的地质学家Andy Tulloch说，他是发现Zealandia的团队的成员。</p><p> But this is just the beginning. Four years on and the continent is as enigmatic as ever, its secrets jealously guarded beneath 6,560 ft (2km) of water. How was it formed? What used to live there? And how long has it been underwater?</p><p> 但这仅仅是开始。四年过去了，非洲大陆像往常一样神秘，它的秘密被秘密保护在6,560英尺（2公里）水深以下。它是如何形成的？过去在那里住过什么？水下已经有多久了？</p><p>   More than a century after Tasman discovered New Zealand in 1642, the British map-maker James Cook was sent on a scientific voyage to the southern hemisphere. His official instructions were to observe the passing of Venus between the Earth and the Sun, in order to calculate how far away the Sun is.</p><p>   塔斯曼（Tasman）在1642年发现新西兰后一个多世纪，英国地图制作者詹姆斯·库克（James Cook）被派往南半球进行科学航行。他的官方指示是观察金星在地球和太阳之间的掠过，以便计算太阳有多远。</p><p>  But he also carried with him a sealed envelope, which he was instructed to open when he had completed the first task. This contained a top-secret mission to discover the southern continent – which he arguably sailed straight over, before reaching New Zealand.</p><p>  但是他还随身携带了一个密封的信封，当他完成第一个任务时，指示他将其打开。这包含了发现南部大陆的绝密任务-在到达新西兰之前，他可以说是直航过去。</p><p> The first real clues of Zealandia&#39;s existence were gathered by the Scottish naturalist Sir James Hector, who attended a voyage to survey a series of islands off the southern coast of New Zealand in 1895. After studying their geology, he concluded that New Zealand is &#34;the  remnant of a mountain-chain that formed the crest of a great continental area that stretched far to the south and east, and which is now submerged…&#34;.</p><p> 苏格兰博物学家詹姆斯·赫克特爵士（Sir James Hector）收集了西兰群岛存在的第一个真实线索，他于1895年参加一次航行，对新西兰南部海岸附近的一系列岛屿进行了勘测。在研究了其地质状况之后，他得出结论：新西兰是＆＃34;山脉的残余物，形成了一个巨大的大陆地区的峰顶，该大陆地区向南和向东延伸，现在被淹没了……。</p><p> Despite this early breakthrough, the knowledge of a possible Zealandia remained obscure, and very little happened until the 1960s. &#34;Things happen pretty slowly in this field,&#34; says Nick Mortimer, a geologist at GNS Science who led the 2017 study.</p><p> 尽管有早期的突破，对可能的西兰西亚人的了解仍然很模糊，直到1960年代几乎没有发生任何事情。 ＆＃34;在这个领域，事情发生得很慢，＆＃34;领导2017年研究的GNS Science地质学家Nick Mortimer说。 </p><p> Then in the 1960s, geologists finally agreed on a definition of what a continent is – broadly, a geological area with a high elevation, wide variety of rocks, and a thick crust. It also has to be big. &#34;You just can&#39;t be a tiny piece,&#34; says Mortimer. This gave geologists something to work with – if they could collect the evidence, they could prove that the eighth continent was real.</p><p>然后在1960年代，地质学家最终就大洲的定义达成了共识–广义上讲，是一个海拔高，岩石种类繁多，地壳厚的地质区域。它也必须很大。 ＆＃34;您不能成为一小块，＆＃34;莫蒂默说。这为地质学家提供了一些可以合作的东西-如果他们可以收集证据，就可以证明第八大陆是真实的。</p><p>   Still, the mission stalled – discovering a continent is tricky and expensive, and Mortimer points out that there was no urgency. Then in 1995, the American geophysicist Bruce Luyendyk again described the region as a continent and suggested calling it Zealandia. From there, Tulloch describes its discovery as an exponential curve.</p><p>   尽管如此，任务仍然停滞不前–发现一个大洲既棘手又昂贵，Mortimer指出没有紧迫性。然后在1995年，美国地球物理学家布鲁斯·卢恩代克（Bruce Luyendyk）再次将该地区描述为一个大陆，并建议将其称为西兰德兰。从这里，Tulloch将其发现描述为指数曲线。</p><p>  Around the same time, the &#34; United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea&#34; came into force, and finally provided some serious motivation. It states that countries can extend their legal territories beyond their Exclusive Economic Zone, which reaches 200 nautical miles (370km) out from their coastlines, to claim their &#34;extended continental shelf&#34; – with all the mineral riches and oil this encompasses.</p><p>  大约在同一时间，＆＃34; 《联合国海洋法公约》生效，并最终提供了一些严肃的动机。声明指出，各国可以将其法定领土延伸到专属经济区以外，该专属经济区从海岸线延伸200海里（370公里），以声明其“延伸的大陆架”。 –包括所有矿产和石油。</p><p> If New Zealand could prove that it was part of a larger continent, it could increase its territory by six times. Suddenly there was an abundance of funding for trips to survey the area, and the evidence gradually built up. With every rock sample that was collected, the case for Zealandia improved.</p><p> 如果新西兰能够证明它是一个更大的大陆的一部分，它的领土可以增加六倍。突然有大量的资金用于对该地区的调查，证据逐渐建立起来。每收集到一块岩石样品，Zlandia的情况就会有所改善。</p><p> The final flourish came from satellite data, which can be used to track tiny variations in the Earth&#39;s gravity across different parts of the crust to map the seafloor. With this technology, Zealandia is clearly visible as a misshapen mass almost as large as Australia.</p><p> 最终的繁荣来自卫星数据，该数据可用于跟踪地壳不同部分的地球重力的微小变化，以绘制海底图。有了这项技术，就可以清楚地看到西兰西亚的畸形质量，几乎与澳大利亚一样大。</p><p>  When the continent was finally unveiled to the world, it unlocked one of the  most sizeable maritime territories in the world. &#34;It is kind of cool,&#34; says Mortimer, &#34;If you think about it, every continent on the planet has different countries on it, [but] there are only three territories on Zealandia.&#34;</p><p>  当该大陆终于对外开放时，它解锁了世界上最大的海域之一。 ＆＃34;很酷，＆＃34;莫蒂默（Mertimer）说，＆＃34;如果您考虑一下，地球上的每个大陆上都有不同的国家，但是[西兰西亚]只有三个领土。</p><p> In addition to New Zealand, the continent encompasses the island of New Caledonia – a French colony famous for its dazzling lagoons – and the tiny Australian territories of Lord Howe Island and Ball&#39;s Pyramid. The latter was described by one 18th-Century explorer as appearing &#34; not to be larger than a boat.&#34;</p><p> 除新西兰外，该大陆还包括新喀里多尼亚岛（法国殖民地以其令人眼花乱的泻湖而闻名）以及澳大利亚的豪勋爵岛和鲍尔金字塔的小领土。后者由一位18世纪的探险家描述为“出现”。不大于船。＆＃34; </p><p>  Zealandia was originally part of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana, which was formed about 550 million years ago and essentially lumped together all the land in the southern hemisphere. It occupied a corner on the eastern side, where it bordered several others, including half of West Antarctica and all of eastern Australia.</p><p>西兰西亚最初是古老的冈瓦纳超大陆的一部分，该大陆是大约5.5亿年前形成的，基本上将南半球的所有土地集中在一起。它位于东侧的一个角落，与其他几个州接壤，包括西南极洲的一半和整个澳大利亚东部。</p><p> Then around 105 million years ago, &#34;due to a process which we don&#39;t completely understand yet, Zealandia started to be pulled away&#34;, says Tulloch.</p><p> Tulloch说，大约在1.05亿年前，由于我们还不完全了解这一过程，西兰西亚开始被撤走。</p><p> Continental crust is usually around 40km deep – significantly thicker than oceanic crust, which tends to be around 10km. As it was strained, Zealandia ended up being stretched so much that its crust now only extends 20km (12.4 miles) down. Eventually, the wafter-thin continent sank – though not quite to the level of normal oceanic crust – and disappeared under the sea.</p><p> 大陆壳通常约40公里深-比海洋壳（通常约10公里）要厚得多。由于压力很大，Ilandia最终被拉伸得如此之大，以至于其地壳现在仅向下延伸20公里（12.4英里）。最终，这片稀薄的大陆沉没了-尽管还没有达到正常的海洋硬壳的水平-却消失在海底。</p><p> Despite being thin and submerged, geologists know that Zealandia is a continent because of the kinds of rocks found there. Continental crust tends to be made up of igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks – like granite, schist and limestone, while the ocean floor is usually just made of igneous ones such as basalt.</p><p> 尽管地处薄弱且被淹没，但地质学家们知道，西兰西亚是一个大陆，因为在那里发现了各种岩石。大陆壳往往由火成岩，变质岩和沉积岩组成，如花岗岩，片岩和石灰石，而海床通常仅由火成岩如玄武岩制成。</p><p>  But there are still many unknowns. The unusual origins of the eighth continent make it particularly intriguing to geologists, and more than a little baffling. For example, it&#39;s still not clear how Zealandia managed to stay together when it&#39;s so thin and not disintegrate into tiny micro-continents.</p><p>  但是仍然有许多未知数。第八大陆的不寻常起源使它对地质学家特别感兴趣，而且令人莫名其妙。例如，尚不清楚新西兰人在这么薄且不会分解成微小的微大陆时如何设法保持在一起。</p><p> Another mystery is exactly when Zealandia ended up underwater – and whether it has ever, in fact, consisted of dry land. The parts that are currently above sea level are ridges that formed as the Pacific and Australian tectonic plates crumpled together. Tulloch says opinion is split as to whether it was always submerged apart from a few small islands, or once entirely dry land.</p><p> 另一个谜团恰恰是西兰西亚何时最终落入水下的事实，以及它是否曾经由旱地组成。当前处于海平面之上的部分是由太平洋和澳大利亚构造板块皱缩在一起形成的山脊。 Tulloch说，人们对它是淹没在几个小岛上还是曾经完全干旱的土地上持有不同意见。</p><p>  With its mild climate and 39 million-sq-mile (101 million-sq-km) range, Gondwana itself was home to a vast array of flora and fauna, including the first four-limbed land animals and later, an abundance of the largest to ever live – the titanosaurs. So, could the rocks of Zealandia be studded with their preserved remains?</p><p>  凭借其温和的气候和3900万平方英里（1.01亿平方公里）的范围，冈瓦纳本身就是众多动植物的家园，其中包括最早的四肢陆生动物和后来的大量最大的陆生动物。永远活着-泰坦龙。难道，西兰西亚的岩石上会保存着保存完好的遗骸吗？ </p><p>  Fossilised land animals are rare in the southern hemisphere, but  the remains of several were found in New Zealand in the 1990s, including the rib bone of a giant, long-tailed, long-necked dinosaur (a sauropod), a beaky herbivorous dinosaur (a hypsilophodont) and an armoured dinosaur (an ankylosaur). Then in 2006,  the foot bone of a large carnivore, possibly a kind of allosaur, was discovered in the Chatham Islands, about 500 miles (800km) east of the South Island. Crucially, the fossils all date to after the continent of Zealandia split from Gondwana.</p><p>僵化的陆地动物在南半球很少见，但在1990年代在新西兰发现了其中的几具，包括巨型长尾长颈恐龙（蜥脚类），喙状草食性恐龙的肋骨（ Hypsilophodont）和装甲恐龙（ankylosaur）。然后在2006年，在南岛以东约500英里（800公里）的查塔姆群岛上发现了一种大型食肉动物（可能是一种异龙）的脚骨。最重要的是，化石的历史可以追溯到西兰西亚大陆从冈瓦纳分裂之后。</p><p>  However, this doesn&#39;t necessarily mean there were dinosaurs roaming over the majority of Zealandia – these islands may have been sanctuaries while the rest was drowned, as it is now. &#34;There&#39;s a long debate about this, about whether it&#39;s possible to have land animals without continuous land – and whether without it, they would have been snuffed out,&#34; says Sutherland.</p><p>  但是，这并不一定意味着有恐龙在整个西兰群岛上空游荡-这些岛屿可能是庇护所，而其余的则被淹死了。关于这一点，人们争论不休，是否有可能拥有没有连续土地的陆生动物；以及如果没有它，它们会被扑灭吗？萨瑟兰说。</p><p> The plot thickens with one of New Zealand&#39;s weirdest and most beloved inhabitants, the kiwi – a dumpy, flightless bird with whiskers and hair-like feathers. Oddly, its closest relative is not thought to be the Moa, which is part of the same group – the ratites – and lived on the same island until its extinction 500 years ago, but the even-more giant elephant bird, which stalked the forests of Madagascar until as recently as 800 years ago.</p><p> 奇异鸟是新西兰最怪异，最受人喜爱的居民之一，它是一种矮胖，不会飞的鸟，有胡须和类似羽毛的羽毛，使该地块变厚了。奇怪的是，它的近亲不被认为是Moa，它是同一群人的一部分-褐土鼠-一直生活在同一岛上，直到500年前灭绝，但那只更大的象鸟在森林中徘徊。直到800年前的马达加斯加。</p><p> The finding has led scientists to believe that both birds evolved from a common ancestor that lived on Gondwana. It took  130 million years to fully break up, but when it did, it left behind fragments which have since been scattered all across the globe, forming South America, Africa, Madagascar, Antarctica, Australia, the Arabian Peninsula, the Indian Subcontinent, and Zealandia.</p><p> 这一发现使科学家们相信这两只鸟都是从居住在冈瓦纳的共同祖先进化而来的。它花费了1.3亿年的时间才完全破裂，但是当它破裂时，它留下了分散在全球各地的碎片，形成了南美，非洲，马达加斯加，南极洲，澳大利亚，阿拉伯半岛，印度次大陆和西兰西亚。</p><p> This, in turn, suggests that at least part of now-submerged Zealandia has remained above sea level the whole time. Except around 25 million years ago the entire continent – even possibly the entirety of New Zealand – is thought to have been  plunged underwater. &#34;It was thought that all the plants and animals must have colonised afterwards,&#34; says Sutherland. So what happened?</p><p> 反过来，这表明现在被淹没的西兰西亚岛至少有一部分一直保持在海平面之上。除了大约2500万年前，整个大陆-甚至可能是整个新西兰-都被淹没在水下。 ＆＃34;认为以后所有的动植物都必须定居，＆＃34;萨瑟兰说。所以发生了什么事？</p><p>  Though it&#39;s not possible to collect fossils from the seafloor of Zealandia directly, scientists have been plumbing its depths by drilling. &#34;Actually the most helpful and distinctive fossils are the ones which form in the very shallow seas,&#34; says Sutherland. &#34;Because they leave a record – there are zillions and zillions of tiny, tiny little fossils that are very distinctive.&#34;</p><p>  尽管不可能直接从西兰西亚海底收集化石，但科学家一直在通过钻探来探究其深度。 ＆＃34;实际上，最有用和最独特的化石是在非常浅的海域中形成的化石，萨瑟兰说。 ＆＃34;因为它们留下了记录–有成千上万的非常独特的微小化石。</p><p> In 2017, a team undertook the most extensive surveys of the region so far, and drilled more than 4,101ft (1,250m) into the seabed at six different sites. The cores that they collected contained pollen from land plants, as well as spores and the shells of organisms that lived in warm, shallow seas.</p><p> 2017年，一个团队进行了迄今为止该地区最广泛的调查，并在六个不同的地点向海床钻了4,101英尺（1,250m）以上。他们收集的核心含有陆地植物的花粉，以及生活在温暖的浅海中的孢子和生物的壳。 </p><p> &#34;If you have water, which is only you know, 10m (33ft) deep or something like this, then there&#39;s a good chance that there was land around as well,&#34; says Sutherland, who explains that the pollen and spores also hint at the possibility that Zealandia was not quite as submerged as was thought.</p><p>＆＃34;如果只有水，深度只有10m（33ft）或类似的东西，那么很有可能周围也有土地，萨瑟兰说，他解释说花粉和孢子也暗示了西兰菌可能没被想象的那么淹没的可能性。</p><p>   &#34;If you look at a geological map of New Zealand, there are two things that really stand out,&#34; says Sutherland. One of these is Alpine Fault, a plate boundary that runs along the South Island and is so significant, it can be seen from space.</p><p>   ＆＃34;如果您看一看新西兰的地质图，有两点确实很突出，＆＃34;萨瑟兰说。其中之一就是阿尔卑斯断层，这是一个沿南岛延伸的板块边界，其意义重大，可以从太空中看到。</p><p>  The second is that the geology of New Zealand – as well as that of the wider continent – is oddly bent. Both are split in two by a horizontal line, which is where the Pacific and Australian tectonic plates meet. At this exact point, it looks like someone has taken the lower half and twisted it away, so that not only do the previously-continuous ribbons of rock no longer line up, but they are almost at right angles.</p><p>  第二个问题是，新西兰以及整个大陆的地质状况都发生了奇怪的变化。两者均由一条水平线一分为二，这是太平洋和澳大利亚构造板块相遇的地方。在这一点上，好像有人拿走了下半部分并将其扭曲开，因此，以前连续的岩石带不再排列在一起，而是几乎成直角。</p><p> An easy explanation for this is that the tectonic plates moved, and somehow deformed them out of shape. But exactly how or when this happened is still totally unresolved.</p><p> 一个简单的解释是，构造板块运动了，并且以某种方式使其变形。但是，确切的方式或发生时间仍完全没有解决。</p><p>  Sutherland explains that the continent is unlikely to give up all its secrets anytime soon. &#34;It&#39;s quite hard to make discoveries, when everything is 2km (1.2 miles) underwater, and the layers that you need to sample are 500m (1,640ft) beneath the seabed as well,&#34; he says. &#34;It&#39;s really challenging to go out and explore a continent like that. So, it just takes a lot of time, money and effort to go out and ships and survey regions.&#34;</p><p>  Sutherland解释说，该大陆不太可能很快放弃其所有秘密。当一切都在水下2公里（1.2英里），并且您需要采样的层也在海床下方500 m（1,640英尺）时，很难发现。他说。走出去探索像这样的大洲确实非常具有挑战性。因此，要花费大量时间，金钱和精力去运送和调查区域。＆＃34;</p><p> If nothing else, the world&#39;s eighth continent surely shows that – nearly 400 years after Tasman&#39;s quest – there is still plenty to be discovered.</p><p> 如果没有其他的话，这个世界第八大洲肯定表明，在塔斯曼（Tasman）追寻行动将近400年之后，仍然有很多值得探索的地方。</p><p>   Join one million Future fans by liking us on    Facebook , or follow us on    Twitter  or    Instagram .</p><p>   通过在Facebook上喜欢我们，或在Twitter或Instagram上关注我们，加入一百万未来粉丝。 </p><p> If you liked this story,    sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter , called &#34;The Essential List&#34;.
