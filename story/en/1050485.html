He was designing their packaging.</p><p> Yeo既不是游戏设计师也不是作家。他正在设计他们的包装。</p><p>    Let’s say you go to the store and buy a video game. What does it look like? Chances are, it comes in a plastic box, roughly the size of a DVD case, and there’s a logo on the top that tells you what platform it’s for — Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo. It’s easy to understand, and it’s easy to fit on shelves. Retailers like it. The platform owners like it. This is the way it’s been for decades — simple, predictable, and safe.</p><p>    假设您去商店买了一个视频游戏。它是什么样子的？可能是，它装在一个塑料盒中，大约相当于DVD盒的大小，并且顶部带有徽标，告诉您该产品适用于Xbox，PlayStation和Nintendo的平台。很容易理解，也很容易放在架子上。零售商喜欢它。平台所有者喜欢它。这就是几十年来的方式-简单，可预测和安全。</p><p> It wasn’t always this way, especially in the computer game industry, where anyone could make a game without needing to get permission. In the early years before the industry was standardized, computer game packaging ran the gamut from loose floppy disks in Ziploc bags 2 to big, intimidating boxes as thick as a dictionary. But why stop there? How about something even weirder or wilder? If there were no rules, why did you have to sell games in a rectangular box at all?</p><p> 并非总是这样，尤其是在计算机游戏行业中，任何人都可以在无需获得许可的情况下制作游戏。在行业标准化之前的最初几年，计算机游戏包装的范围从Ziploc袋2中的松散软盘到像字典一样厚的大型吓人盒子。但是为什么要停在那里？甚至更奇怪或更野性的东西怎么样？如果没有规则，为什么您根本必须在矩形框中出售游戏？</p><p> If you really wanted your game to make an impression, you called Hock Wah Yeo.</p><p> 如果您真的想让您的游戏给人留下深刻的印象，那就给Hock Wah Yeo打个电话。</p><p> Yeo is a graphic designer based in the San Francisco Bay Area, and through the 80s and 90s, he created the boldest, most unusual packaging in the game industry. While other game publishers were trying to get attention with flashy, colorful, in-your-face aesthetics, Yeo was deconstructing the idea of what a game box could be altogether. He made boxes shaped like pyramids and trapezoids, boxes that conveyed emotions and movement with their physical shape, designed to stop people in their tracks and get them to pick it up. And whether he intended it or not, his work landed him right in the middle of a battle for the future of retail space.</p><p> Yeo是旧金山湾区的一名平面设计师，在80年代和90年代，他创造了游戏行业中最大胆，最不寻常的包装。当其他游戏发行商试图以浮华，多彩，面部表情吸引人们的注意力时，Yeo正在解构一个游戏盒可以完全是什么的想法。他制作了形状像金字塔和梯形的盒子，这些盒子通过其物理形状传达了情感和动作，旨在阻止人们进入正轨，并让他们捡起它。无论他是否打算，他的工作都使他在零售业的未来之战中脱颖而出。</p><p> In this article, we’re going deep into the game packaging design work by Hock Wah Yeo, the developers who hired him, and the industry that could barely keep up.</p><p> 在本文中，我们将深入研究Hock Wah Yeo的游戏包装设计工作，雇用他的开发人员以及几乎无法跟上的行业。 </p><p>      In the span of Hock Wah Yeo’s career, making game boxes was something that happened by accident.</p><p>在Hock Wah Yeo的整个职业生涯中，制作游戏机盒是偶然发生的事情。</p><p> Yeo was the co-founder of the Design Office of Wong &amp; Yeo, a graphic design firm he ran with his partner at the time, Valerie Wong. 3 While Wong was mostly handling corporate clients, designing things like brochures and logos, Yeo was doing product design and packaging. (Wong did not respond to interview requests for this article.) He was interested in what he described as “the art in practical things” — the design aspects of everyday objects, finding something ordinary and turning it into something unexpected. 1,4</p><p> Yeo是Wong＆amp; amp; amp;设计办公室的联合创始人。杨（Yeo）是当时与合伙人瓦莱丽·王（Valerie Wong）共同经营的一家图形设计公司。 3 Wong主要负责处理公司客户，设计小册子和徽标之类的东西，而Yeo则从事产品设计和包装。 （Wong没有回应这篇文章的采访要求。）他对自己所说的“实际事物中的艺术”感兴趣-日常物品的设计方面，发现一些平凡的东西并将其变成意想不到的东西。 1,4</p><p> Unfortunately, his earliest clients didn’t quite allow him to be as creative as he wanted. One of his first jobs at the Design Office was designing packaging for wine bottles, but he found it to be stifling, unexciting work. The wine industry is steeped in tradition, with a long history of standards and expectations for product design that didn’t leave him much room for creativity. “I’ve done odd-shaped labels on them,” Yeo said, “but still, you have to have a standard bottle. You can’t change that shape.” 1</p><p> 不幸的是，他最早的客户并没有完全允许他发挥自己想要的创造力。他在设计办公室的最初工作之一是设计葡萄酒瓶的包装，但他发现这是令人窒息的，令人兴奋的工作。葡萄酒行业传统悠久，对标准和对产品设计的期望由来已久，因此没有太多的创造空间。 Yeo说：“我已经在它们上面做过异形标签，但仍然必须有一个标准的瓶子。您无法更改形状。” 1个</p><p>  Everything changed for Yeo one evening at a wedding dinner, when he crossed paths with Thom Hayward, a creative director at Broderbund Software. Hayward was responsible for handling Broderbund’s packaging, and as it happened, he was looking for a new designer to work on one of their upcoming products.</p><p>  Yeo在一个结婚晚宴上的一个晚上改变了一切，当时他与Broderbund Software的创意总监Thom Hayward越过路。海沃德负责处理Broderbund的包装，并且碰巧发生了，他正在寻找新的设计师来处理他们即将推出的产品之一。</p><p> That’s how Yeo landed his first work for the software industry, creating the cover art for… an office program called  Thinking Cap. It was not a high-profile piece of software. “I mean, they weren’t gonna risk a big game on me for the first time,” Yeo said, laughing. 1</p><p> 这就是Yeo着手在软件行业从事的第一项工作的方式，为……名为“ Thinking Cap”的办公程序创建封面。它不是一个引人注目的软件。 Yeo笑着说：“我的意思是，他们不会第一次冒险在我身上发生一场大比赛。” 1个</p><p> Thinking Cap has a busy cover, featuring crayon-style shapes and squiggles in a bold neon-pastel palette in the style of  the Memphis design movement from the 80s. It was more than Yeo could’ve gotten away with on a wine bottle, for sure, and it’s certainly a surprising look for what was, effectively, a program that helped you write outlines.</p><p> Thought Cap的封面很忙，采用蜡笔风格的形状和大胆的霓虹色调色板中的花体，采用了80年代孟菲斯设计的风格。当然，这远远超出了Yeo所能拥有的葡萄酒瓶，对于有效地帮助您编写轮廓的程序来说，这无疑是令人惊讶的外观。</p><p> From that point on, the Design Office of Wong &amp; Yeo became a staple in Broderbund’s line-up of designers. Among other things, they designed the packaging for a majority of the games Broderbund released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, including well-known titles like  Lode Runner and  Deadly Towers. It might not have been the most exciting design work, but compared to other boxes for NES games, they have a unique, sharp style, with the art illustrations partially covered up by a solid-texture cutout. And most importantly, the Design Office put their name on the underside of every box. It was unusual at the time for external designers to receive credit like this, especially on Nintendo games, but they wanted to be acknowledged for their work. 1</p><p> 从那时起，黄＆amp; amp;设计办公室Yeo成为Broderbund设计师阵容的主要组成部分。除其他外，他们为Broderbund为Nintendo Entertainment System发行的大多数游戏设计了包装，其中包括Lode Runner和Deadly Towers等著名游戏。它可能不是最激动人心的设计作品，但与其他NES游戏盒相比，它们具有独特，鲜明的风格，艺术插图的一部分被坚实纹理的切口遮盖了。最重要的是，设计办公室在每个盒子的下面都贴上了他们的名字。当时外部设计师获得这样的荣誉是很不寻常的，尤其是在任天堂游戏上，但他们的工作要受到认可。 1个 </p><p>  While Yeo’s early design work for Broderbund is good, it’s not too much different from what else was out on the market. But soon, a project came along that would let him approach packaging design from a completely new angle.</p><p>虽然Yeo为Broderbund所做的早期设计工作不错，但与市场上的其他产品并没有太大区别。但是很快，一个项目就出现了，这将使他从一个全新的角度着手进行包装设计。</p><p> Broderbund had signed on new developer, Velocity, to publish their upcoming flight simulator game  JetFighter: The Adventure. “They wanted to make a big splash with their product,” Yeo explained, and Broderbund assigned him to work with the studio on a new box concept. Now a trusted designer for Broderbund, Yeo was given carte blanche for the first time to come up with any idea he wanted.</p><p> Broderbund已与新开发人员Velocity签约，以发布他们即将推出的飞行模拟器游戏JetFighter：The Adventure。 Yeo解释说：“他们希望用自己的产品大放异彩。” Broderbund指派他与工作室合作开发新的盒子概念。现在，他是Broderbund值得信赖的设计师，Yeo首次获得了全权委托，想出他想要的任何想法。</p><p> For inspiration, he visited software stores to see what stood out. “We went to the stores and looked at what’s being displayed,” Yeo said, “and we noticed that, at that time, just in any retail stores, there’s a lot of noise, a lot of colors, messages yelling at you” — but it was all two-dimensional, printed on the sides of rectangular boxes.</p><p> 为了获得灵感，他参观了软件商店，以了解突出之处。 Yeo说：“我们去商店看了看陈列的东西，当时我们注意到，在任何零售商店中，都有很多杂音，很多颜色，消息在向你大吼大叫” –但都是二维的，印在矩形盒子的侧面。</p><p> “We just realized that the one thing they haven’t done was to differentiate their product with form.” 1</p><p> “我们只是意识到他们没有做的一件事就是通过形式来区别他们的产品。” 1个</p><p>    As the software industry was growing, packaging was a big driver for sales. More people were buying computers, but they didn’t necessarily know what software was out there. Even by the early-mid-90s, reviews, previews, and advertisements for software were still a bit of a niche market, so unless consumers were reading computer and gaming magazines, they probably didn’t know what they were going to buy until they walked into the store. That’s when an eye-popping package would get their attention. 6</p><p>    随着软件行业的发展，包装是销售的主要动力。越来越多的人购买计算机，但是他们不一定知道那里有什么软件。即使到90年代中期，软件的评论，预览和广告仍然是一个小众市场，因此，除非消费者阅读计算机和游戏杂志，否则他们可能直到购买他们的产品时才知道要买什么。走进商店。到那时，令人眼花package乱的程序包就会引起他们的注意。 6</p><p> Software Etc., one of the major American software retailers, put a premium on good-looking packaging. “It is 80 to 90 percent of whether or not we carry the product,” said Chuck Whitaker, divisional merchandise manager for Software Etc., in a 1994 issue of  Computer Retail Week. 7 If the packaging was high quality, that was a hint — both to consumers and retailers — that the software inside was worth looking at. 6,7 You could sell the best program in the plainest box, “but if you can’t get the customer to pick the box up,” Whitaker said, “who cares?” 7</p><p> 美国最大的软件零售商之一，Software Etc.十分重视外观精美的包装。 “我们是否携带该产品的比例为80％到90％，” Software Etc.的部门商品经理Chuck Whitaker在1994年的《计算机零售周》上说。 7如果包装的质量很高，那么对消费者和零售商而言，这都意味着其中的软件值得一看。 6,7您可以在最平淡的盒子中出售最好的程序，“但是，如果您不能让客户接起盒子，”惠特克说，“谁在乎呢？” 7</p><p> That was the core of Yeo’s design philosophy: getting people to pick up the box. “If you want to sell somebody something,” he said, “it’s gotta be in your hands.” So how do you do it? You have to shock them on a subconscious level. It’s something that Yeo refers to as “disturbing the mindset.”</p><p> 这就是Yeo的设计理念的核心：吸引人们来拿起盒子。他说：“如果你想卖给别人某物，那一定要掌握在你手中。”你是怎么做到的？您必须在潜意识上震惊他们。 Yeo称之为“干扰思维定势”。 </p><p> Yeo explained it to me by using the example of a new car. Whenever Toyota rolls out a new model, we’re probably not going to pay close attention to it. A car is a car, right? “But if Toyota introduced a three-wheel car,” he continued, “we all would look at it, because our reference for ‘car’ is that it has to have four wheels, and now that’s changed. It’s new information.” Our brains instinctively tell us that this thing should not be the way it is. “If we disturb your mindset, you’re curious,” Yeo said. “The reaction is not, ‘Is this product right for me?’ The immediate reaction should be, ‘What the hell is it?&#39;”</p><p>杨以新车为例向我解释了这一点。每当丰田推出新车型时，我们可能就不会密切关注它。汽车就是汽车，对吗？他继续说：“但是如果丰田推出了三轮汽车，我们都会考虑，因为我们对“汽车”的提法是它必须有四个轮子，现在已经改变了。这是新信息。”我们的大脑本能地告诉我们，这件事不应该是这样。 “如果我们打扰您的心态，您会感到好奇，”杨说。 “反应不是，‘这个产品适合我吗？’直接反应应该是‘到底是什么？＆＃39;”</p><p> “When that hits the conscious mind, they’ll pick it up,” he said, “and that’s when you sell it to them.” 1</p><p> 他说：“当这击中了有意识的头脑时，他们会捡起它，那就是当您将它们卖给他们时。” 1个</p><p>   As Yeo recalls it, the software market in the late 80s and early 90s was still small enough that it was easy to get your products on store shelves, and the relatively small audience for software was eager to buy something new. “Even if you sold it in a brown bag, it would have been sold,” Yeo joked. But that was no reason to be complacent. It was an opportunity to do something new and surprising. “We knew that in time, marketing would get more difficult, that we need to have an edge. We need to create an emotional response to the product.” 1 They needed to disturb the mindset, and in a software store, the way to do that was changing the shape of the box.</p><p>   正如Yeo回忆的那样，在80年代末和90年代初，软件市场仍然很小，以至于可以很容易地将您的产品上架销售，并且相对较小的软件受众也渴望购买新产品。 “即使把它装在一个棕色的袋子里，它也会被卖出去的。”杨o开玩笑说。但这没有理由感到自满。这是做新的和令人惊讶的事情的机会。 “我们知道，随着时间的推移，营销会变得更加困难，我们需要拥有优势。我们需要对产品产生情感上的回应。” 1他们需要打乱思维定势，在软件商店中，这样做的方法是改变盒子的形状。</p><p> That’s what you can see above with the box for  JetFighter. The top of the box is angled so that it would rise above the rest of the games on the shelf, suggesting a fighter jet lifting off at high speed. On the back of the box, two flaps fold out, loosely evoking the features on the jet’s wings. These are small changes, but significant enough that they completely alter the profile of the box. It literally stands out over the competition.</p><p> 这就是您上面带有JetFighter框的内容。盒子的顶部是倾斜的，因此它会升到架子上其余游戏的上方，这表明一架喷气战斗机可以高速起飞。箱子的背面有两个折翼，可以轻松唤起喷气机机翼上的功能。这些变化很小，但意义重大，足以完全改变盒子的轮廓。从字面上看，它在竞争中脱颖而出。</p><p>  Evidently, it was a success, because Velocity brought back Yeo to make the packaging for the sequel  JetFighter II. Again, he added some minor three-dimensional elements, this time with a large V-shape sticking out of the front that opened up like a lid. It’s only a small difference looking at it on a shelf, but in 1990, there was little else like this on the market.</p><p>  显然，这是成功的，因为Velocity带回Yeo制作续集JetFighter II的包装。再次，他添加了一些次要的三维元素，这次是从前面伸出一个大的V形，像一个盖子一样打开。在架子上看它只是一个很小的差别，但是在1990年，市场上几乎没有其他类似的东西。</p><p> The two  JetFighter games were the first time Yeo finally got to experiment with unusual form factors, something he had always wanted to do in his design work but never had the opportunity until he fell in with the game industry. While the computer game business had existed for many years at this point, it was quickly expanding, and the lack of established norms and standards meant that developers were willing to try something totally off-the-wall to break through. 8</p><p> 这两款JetFighter游戏是Yeo首次尝试使用不寻常的外形进行试验，这是他在设计工作中一直想做的事情，但是直到进入游戏行业之前他才有机会。在这一点上，计算机游戏业务已经存在了很多年，但它却在迅速扩展，而缺乏既定的规范和标准意味着开发人员愿意尝试一些彻底的突破。 8</p><p> “It was the frontier. I loved it,” Yeo told me. Compared to his old clients, he liked working with small game publishers because of their energy and their eagerness to experiment. “They were more innovative, and they were willing to look at new ideas afresh without preconceptions,” he said. “I’m so thankful that I fell into [gaming], that this allowed me to create what I created. Any other industry, it wouldn’t have allowed me that much creativity.” 1 In other words, it sure was a lot more fun than designing wine labels.</p><p> “这是边境。我喜欢它，” Yeo告诉我。与他的老客户相比，他喜欢与小型游戏发行商合作，因为他们精力充沛且渴望实验。他说：“他们更具创新性，他们愿意在没有先入之见的情况下重新审视新想法。” “我非常感激能够参加[游戏]，这使我得以创造出自己创造的东西。任何其他行业，都不会给我那么多的创造力。” 1换句话说，它肯定比设计葡萄酒标签有趣得多。 </p><p> Yeo’s work was starting to turn heads in the industry.  Computer Reseller News, one of the early publications for the computer retailers, reported in August 1991 that  JetFighter and  JetFighter II had “warped the notion of the traditional rectangular box […] winning itself prime floor space at several retailers.” And it wasn’t just getting attention from consumers and store-owners but from other game developers as well, who were realizing they could cut through the noise of retail spaces with distinctive packaging. 8</p><p>Yeo的工作开始在业界引起关注。作为计算机零售商的早期出版物之一，《计算机经销商新闻》在1991年8月报道说，JetFighter和JetFighter II“扭曲了传统的矩形盒子的概念[…]在多家零售商中赢得了主要的地面空间。”这不仅引起了消费者和商店所有者的关注，而且也引起了其他游戏开发商的注意，他们意识到，可以通过独特的包装来消除零售空间的噪音。 8</p><p> One of those developers was Craig Fryar from Peninsula Gameworks, who was trying to figure out what to do with their new game,  Spectre. It was an unconventional title — a networked multiplayer game for the Macintosh at a time when neither of those things were common — and Fryar was having difficulty finding a publisher for it. When he saw the box for  JetFighter II, he knew that Velocity was the sort of publisher that would be willing to take risks. And he wanted  Spectre to have a box like that too. 9,10</p><p> 其中一位开发者是Peninsula Gameworks的Craig Fryar，他试图弄清楚如何处理他们的新游戏Spectre。这是一个非常规的标题-Macintosh上的一种联网多人游戏，当时这两种情况都不常见-而且Fryar很难为其找到发行商。当他看到JetFighter II的包装盒时，他知道Velocity是愿意冒险的那种发行商。而且他也希望Spectre也有这样的盒子。 9,10</p><p> Velocity did agree to publish the game, and once again they hired Yeo to design the packaging. This time, with some experience in odd geometries, he threw out the rectangular box and rethought the concept of game packaging from the ground up.</p><p> Velocity确实同意发布游戏，然后他们再次聘请Yeo设计包装。这次，他凭借在奇异几何形状方面的一些经验，扔出了矩形盒子，并从头开始重新思考游戏包装的概念。</p><p>   When Yeo was making packaging for a game, the way he thought about it, he was giving the game a physical form. Software is “intangible,” he explained, and when you’re designing a box, it’s a opportunity to give the game a physical shape, to take a digital idea and turn it into a real, three-dimensional object. 1</p><p>   当Yeo为游戏制作包装时，他以这种方式思考，他是在给游戏一种物理形式。他解释说，软件是“无形的”，当您设计盒子时，这是一个机会，使游戏具有物理形状，采用数字创意并将其转变为真实的三维物体。 1个</p><p> That was the idea behind the pyramid-shaped box for  Spectre. The shape of the package was based on the game’s flat, low-polygonal graphics, where all the tanks are made out of single-color triangles. 1 It was like the game itself was protruding into physical space, like one of the tanks had escaped into the real world, and now you could hold it.</p><p> 那就是Spectre金字塔形盒子背后的想法。包装的形状基于游戏的扁平低多边形图形，其中所有的战车都由单色三角形制成。 1就像游戏本身伸入了物理空间，就像其中一辆坦克已经逃到现实世界中一样，现在您可以握住它了。</p><p> The developers immediately supported it. “We were just knocked out,” Fryar remembered. “We were like, yep, this is gonna make history. This is gonna make waves.” 10</p><p> 开发人员立即支持它。 “我们刚刚被淘汰，”弗莱尔回忆道。 “我们就像，是的，这将创造历史。这会引起波澜。” 10</p><p> In a store full of busy-looking packages vying for your attention,  Spectre was like an object from another dimension. It was a single plain color with minimal text on the front to explain itself. It was irresistible. Thanks in large part to the packaging design, the game sold far more units than expected — upwards of half a million copies — and soon after, Fryar was fielding phone calls from other curious developers, who were thinking about ordering their own unusual boxes and wanted to learn more about the process. 10</p><p> 在一个充满忙碌包装的商店中争夺您的注意力，Spectre就像是来自另一个维度的对象。它是一种纯色，前面带有很少的文字说明。这是不可抗拒的。很大程度上要归功于包装设计，这款游戏的销量远远超出了预期（超过50万本）。随后，弗莱尔（Fryar）接到了其他好奇的开发商的电话，他们正在考虑订购自己的不寻常盒子，并希望了解有关该过程的更多信息。 10 </p><p> Yeo remembers he was actually contacted by someone in the book publishing industry who didn’t even play computer games but who bought  Spectre, just because it was such a bizarre-looking item that he had to get it. (He wanted to commission something like that for his own company, but it never went anywhere; you can’t really make a pyramid-shaped book.) 1</p><p>Yeo记得他实际上是与书籍出版业的某人联系的，他甚至没有玩电脑游戏，但购买了Spectre，只是因为这件看起来很奇怪的东西，他必须得到它。 （他想为自己的公司委托类似的服务，但它从未成功过；您无法真正制作出金字塔形的书。）1</p><p> It was a turning point for the Design Office of Wong &amp; Yeo. When I spoke with game developers who worked with Hock Wah Yeo, most of them said they were inspired by hire the Design Office because of the box for  Spectre. 11,12 Or if it wasn’t  Spectre, it was the box he designed shortly after for  Prince of Persia. 13</p><p> 这是黄＆amp; amp;设计办公室的转折点。嗯当我与与霍华W（Hock Wah Yeo）合作的游戏开发人员交谈时，他们中的大多数人都说，受Spectre的启发，他们受雇于设计办公室。 11,12如果不是Spectre，那是他不久后为波斯王子设计的盒子。 13</p><p>   Prince of Persia had been out for three years by that point, and in preparation for a re-release and a port to the Macintosh, Broderbund decided to bring in Yeo to freshen up the packaging. They wanted something similar to what he did for the  JetFighter games, something that played around with three-dimensional form. That’s when he created the famous “trapezoid” box for  Prince of Persia (seen above), a two-piece design that captures the perspective and momentum of the hero leaping over a pit of spikes.</p><p>   那时，波斯王子已经出行了三年，为了准备重新发行和移植到Macintosh，Broderbund决定带上Yeo来重新包装。他们想要的东西类似于他在JetFighter游戏中所做的，并且以三维形式玩耍。从那时起，他为波斯王子创造了著名的“梯形”盒子（如上所示），这种两件式设计捕捉了英雄越过尖峰坑的视角和动量。</p><p> The new design outperformed their expectations: according to Yeo, when the new box was released, sales of the game tripled. 1 (I was unable to reach  Prince of Persia designer Jordan Mechner to corroborate that figure.)</p><p> 新设计的表现超出了他们的期望：根据Yeo的说法，发布新包装后，游戏的销量增长了两倍。 1（我无法联系波斯王子的设计师Jordan Mechner证实这一数字。）</p><p> “From then on, all these publishers came to us and said, ‘Can you do us a  Prince of Persia box?&#39;” Yeo recalled. 1</p><p> “从那时起，所有这些出版商都来找我们，说：‘您能给我们做一个波斯王子的盒子吗？＆＃39;”杨回忆。 1个</p><p> Between  Spectre and  Prince of Persia, Yeo’s style of unconventional box design had proven itself, and with all the business they were suddenly getting, the Design Office’s strategy of putting their name on their work had paid off. Publishers wanted to take risks, and here was a new, surprising way for their games to get attention.</p><p> 在Spectre和波斯王子之间，Yeo的非常规包装盒设计风格得到了证明，随着他们突然间获得的所有业务，设计办公室将自己的名字印在作品上的策略获得了回报。发行商想冒险，这是他们的游戏获得关注的一种新的，令人惊讶的方式。</p><p> But their work also exposed a rift that would vex the game industry for the next decade.</p><p> 但是他们的工作也暴露出一个裂痕，这将困扰下一个十年的游戏产业。 </p><p>      If you couldn’t tell from the picture, the box for  Spectre has a black, plastic triangle sticking out of the front. According to Fryar, that triangle was a big problem for software retailers, because they would have trouble stacking the box without accidentally damaging it. 10,14 It looked cool, but it took up a lot of room, and it was difficult to get on the shelves. For the follow-ups to  Spectre —  Spectre Supreme and  Spectre VR — Yeo created a new tapered pyramid design without any elements sticking out that would be easier to handle, 10 but it was still too cumbersome for some stores to deal with.</p><p>如果您无法从图片中分辨出来，则Spectre的框的前面有一个黑色的塑料三角形。根据Fryar的说法，三角形对于软件零售商来说是个大问题，因为他们在堆叠盒子时会遇到麻烦，不会意外损坏它。 10,14看起来很酷，但占用了很多空间，很难上架。对于Spectre（Spectre Supreme）和Spectre VR的后续产品，Yeo创建了一个新的锥形金字塔设计，没有任何突出的元素，这很容易处理，但10对于某些商店来说仍然太麻烦了。</p><p> “I was at the Electronics Boutique managers’ meeting last year, and a number of them came up and told me: ‘Love your game, hate your box,&#39;” Michael Nelson, CEO of Velocity, told  Computer Retail Week in 1994. “When you get certain feedback from retailers, you have to take it to heart.” 15</p><p> “去年我参加了电子精品店经理会议，其中许多人告诉我：‘爱你的游戏，讨厌你的盒子，＆＃39;” Velocity的首席执行官Michael Nelson在1994年接受《计算机零售周》采访时说：“当您从零售商那里得到某些反馈时，您必须将其牢记在心。” 15</p><p> The lack of standardized packaging was a major source of frustration for software stores in the 1990s, and for years and years, retailers and game publishers tried to come to terms on a set of rules for what computer game boxes should look like. There were good reasons for everyone involved to reach an agreement, not only to free up precious retail shelf space and bring down manufacturing costs, but also to reduce the waste generated by continuing to make these giant, empty boxes. 8,15,16,17 Despite groups like the Software Publishers Association holding roundtables with major retail chains to hash out their differences, 17,18,19 there would be no consensus over the proper size of computer games for nearly a decade. 20 Big stores like Kmart and Walmart threatened to go it alone and ban oversized game packaging by themselves, but they never managed to reach the critical mass necessary to force change across the entire industry. 16,17,19,21</p><p> 缺乏标准化包装是1990年代软件商店沮丧的一个主要根源，多年来，零售商和游戏发行商试图就计算机游戏盒应遵循的一套规则达成协议。参与其中的每个人都有充分的理由达成协议，不仅要释放宝贵的零售货架空间并降低制造成本，而且要减少继续制造这些巨大的空盒子所产生的浪费。 8,15,16,17尽管像软件发行商协会这样的组织通过与主要零售连锁店举行圆桌会议来解决它们之间的差异，[17,18,19]在将近十年的适当计算机游戏规模上仍未达成共识。像Kmart和Walmart这样的20家大型商店扬言要独自经营，并禁止超大型游戏包装，但是它们从未达到推动整个行业变革所必需的临界数量。 16,17,19,21</p><p> The reason everyone was reluctant to agree to any changes was that, as inconvenient as they were, big weird boxes sold well. Games like  JetFighter might have been annoying to work with, but the striking packaging designs really did spark curiosity and entice sales. 8,15 Dewey Thoes, the software purchaser for CompUSA, said that in the months following its release,  JetFighter II — a game that’s not particularly well-known today — was one of the company’s top sellers. 8</p><p> 每个人都不愿意接受任何更改的原因是，尽管很不方便，但大怪异的盒子卖得很好。像JetFighter这样的游戏可能很烦人，但是引人注目的包装设计确实引起了人们的好奇心并吸引了销售。 8,15 CompUSA的软件购买者Dewey Thoes说，在发行之后的几个月中，JetFighter II（一款今天并不特别出名的游戏）是该公司最畅销的游戏之一。 8</p><p>  “Our category is unique in that the packaging has to do all the marketing for the consumer,” said Babbage’s president Gary Kusin. If the boxes were smaller and standardized, whatever benefits that would bring the stores in terms of logistics, it would make the games seem less valuable, and that might hurt sales. 21</p><p>  巴贝奇（Babbage）总裁加里·库辛（Gary Kusin）表示：“我们的类别很独特，因为包装必须为消费者进行所有营销。”如果包装盒较小且标准化，则无论从物流方面为商店带来什么好处，都将使游戏的价值降低，并可能损害销售。 21岁</p><p> Thus, retailers would put up with games that were shaped like, in one case, Snoopy’s doghouse from  Peanuts, because they did strong numbers, 15 and even if they were a hassle, no party was interested in upending their mutually beneficial arrangement. “We like what we have today,” CompUSA vice president of merchandising Ellen Miller told  Computer Retail Week, “but [we’d like it] tempered.” 21</p><p> 因此，零售商会忍受像花生中的史努比狗窝那样形状的游戏，因为它们的销售量很高，有15种，即使他们很麻烦，也没有任何一方有兴趣破坏他们互惠互利的安排。 CompUSA产品副总裁艾伦·米勒（Ellen Miller）对《计算机零售周刊》说：“我们喜欢我们今天拥有的东西，但是[我们希望]有所节制。” 21岁</p><p> Yeo was aware that the retail industry wasn’t thrilled about his packaging. But as he noted, that didn’t stop them from buying the games, and he saw no reason to make things simpler. “As long as they’re still putting out products on the shelf, we’ll continue doing it,” he said, “because my job is to get them  off the shelf, into the consumer’s hands, not making it easy for the retailer.” 1</p><p> Yeo意识到零售业对他的包装并不感到兴奋。但是正如他指出的那样，这并没有阻止他们购买游戏，而且他认为没有理由使事情变得更简单。他说：“只要他们仍将产品摆在货架上，我们就会继续这样做，因为我的工作是将产品从货架上移交给消费者，而不是让零售商容易。” 1个 </p><p> Some former clients said the same thing. Edward de Jong from Magic Mouse Productions recalled that retailers didn’t have a problem as long as the software kept selling. If they couldn’t move the products, de Jong believed that was their own problem, and it was no reason to crack down on creativity. “Imagine if cosmetics had packaging rules,” de Jong said, “how boring would that be.” 12</p><p>一些以前的客户说了同样的话。 Magic Mouse Productions的Edward de Jong回忆说，只要软件继续销售，零售商就不会遇到问题。德容认为，如果他们不能转移产品，那是他们自己的问题，也没有理由打击创造力。德琼说：“想象一下化妆品是否有包装规定，那会多么无聊。” 12</p><p>    The Design Office of Wong &amp; Yeo had made a name for themselves, and now their services were in demand. “We were just overwhelmed with the amount of work that was coming in at that time,” Yeo said. Some of their clients would be as small as one person, or they could be some of the largest publishers in the industry. Whoever they were, Yeo says the process worked largely the same way.</p><p>    黄＆amp;设计事务所Yeo为自己赢得了名声，现在他们的服务需求旺盛。 Yeo说：“当时，我们不胜其烦。”他们的一些客户可能只有一个人，或者他们可能是业内最大的出版商。 Yeo表示，无论他们是谁，该过程基本上都以相同的方式进行。</p><p>  When a publisher hired the Design Office to create their game box, the first thing Yeo would do is set expectations. They hired him because they wanted him to design something unique and bizarre that no one had ever seen before, and he wanted to be sure they understood what that meant. “We were upfront with all our clients that that we do is unconventional,” he explained. If they had too many restrictions or preconceived ideas about what the box should be like, he wouldn’t take the job. “If we didn’t have room to deviate,” Yeo continued, “we would say, no, this project is not right for us.” 1</p><p>  当发行商雇用设计办公室来创建他们的游戏盒时，Yeo要做的第一件事就是设定期望值。他们之所以雇用他，是因为他们希望他设计出前所未有的独特而怪异的东西，并且他想确保他们理解这意味着什么。他解释说：“我们在与所有客户的合作中领先于我们，这是非常规的。”如果他们对包装盒的形状有太多的限制或先入为主的想法，那么他就不会担任这份工作。 Yeo继续说：“如果我们没有偏离的空间，我们会说，不，这个项目不适合我们。” 1个</p><p> Then they would try out an early version of the game. It would be rude to say that </p><p> 然后他们将尝试游戏的早期版本。这么说是不礼貌的</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://obscuritory.com/essay/incredible-boxes-of-hock-wah-yeo/">https://obscuritory.com/essay/incredible-boxes-of-hock-wah-yeo/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/福华/">#福华</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/hock/">#hock</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
