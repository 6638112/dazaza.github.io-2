The reality was entirely different. Financial insecurity, increased parental responsibilities and anxiety about the future, along with other difficulties, prompted many to delay or forego having a baby. Economists are now projecting 300,000 fewer births in the United States this year than would have been expected before the pandemic.\n Demographic changes can have economic ramifications. Falling birthrates mean smaller generations of taxpayers will eventually be responsible for supporting larger generations of retirees. Historically, therefore, governments have viewed a declining birthrate as an existential threat, raising the spectre of decline or extinction. The question of how direct government action might encourage a higher birthrate is not new; European governments have been grappling with this question for decades, France foremost among them.\n France was the first country in Europe to undergo demographic transition, a sustained drop in both mortality and birth rates. Most European states experienced the transition gradually; mortality rates fell during the 18th and 19th centuries, yet birthrates remained high until roughly the early 20th century. In 18th-century France, they happened almost simultaneously. As a result, 19th-century demographers warned that France\u2019s population was increasing only marginally, in contrast to the rapid growth of its neighbours. Experts and reformers interpreted the country\u2019s defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 as a warning of what could happen to a \u2018decadent\u2019 country heading towards depopulation.\n The urgency of the crisis intensified in the last decade of the century, when the \u2018Russian influenza\u2019 briefly increased mortality rates. This pandemic, which began in autumn 1889 and continued into early 1894, killed at least one million people globally. In France, which had registered only modest annual population gains even before the pandemic (due to the country\u2019s low birthrate), the outbreak had a sobering effect. Deaths had actually exceeded births in the years 1890, 1891, 1892 and 1895.  As coffins outnumbered cradles, France\u2019s fledgling pro-natalist movement stepped up its campaign, urging the public to have more babies and lobbying for government action. It contrasted France\u2019s modest population gains with those of its neighbours, using powerful images that, for example, represented France as a small, frail man standing next to a tall, muscular Germany.\n Historians generally see the years following the First World War as the moment when French elected officials began systematically trying to influence population trends. After sustaining devastating numbers of casualties during the conflict, France\u2019s prospects for demographic recovery seemed poor. While there was some population growth in the interwar years (1919-39), this was due mostly to immigration, rather than an excess of births over deaths. The sluggish growth gave pro-natalist rhetoric a convincing sense of urgency. As the pro-natalist leader Jacques Bertillon wrote in 1919, France\u2019s victory in 1918 would be meaningless if its low birthrate continued to leave the country vulnerable to invasion.\n As French policy makers and reformers tried to encourage more births, they had to grapple with the question of why the birthrate was low to begin with. Pro-natalists offered explanations for the trend towards small families, including the modern desire for social mobility, migration to cities from country villages, tax and inheritance laws and the high cost of housing and education. Beyond financial and logistical obstacles, they saw a much more insidious cause. Many people, women specifically, simply did not want large families.\n Gender had everything to do with this assessment. Pro-natalists asserted that women\u2019s declining fertility rates were symptomatic of the breakdown of the family and gender roles. Propaganda conjured up images of a vast epidemic of modern women lacking a maternal instinct and choosing a life of voluntary sterility as they cared more about maintaining a fashionable figure than devoting themselves to a family. These images were more rhetoric than reality, however. Data indicates that most women of this generation did become mothers; they may have preferred smaller families, but they were not choosing a child-free existence.\n Some government action in this period aimed to make it harder for women to choose smaller families. This included two laws passed in 1920: one making it illegal to sell or distribute contraceptive devices or information; the other strengthening the existing law punishing illegal abortions. There was also a strong push to offer an array of financial benefits and rewards, such as allowances, to families with children. This was in part to incentivise more births and make it easier to support larger families. It was also about encouraging the population to see the process of producing and raising the next generation of soldiers, workers and mothers as a collective responsibility. Such propaganda made it clear that those who chose to have few or no children \u2013 and it was usually presented as a choice \u2013 would have to help support the children of more prolific households. It depicted exhausted parents raising large families in squalid conditions, while childless couples lived in luxury, an injustice that could only be corrected through family benefits.\n In the decades that followed, the French government expanded many of these pro-natalist benefits, and introduced new ones. Naturally, France\u2019s history of demographic policies raises the question of just how effective such measures can be. After the Second World War, for example, family allowances were generous, sometimes even representing an entire second income for low-income families with many children. This benefit was lauded as a success and credited with contributing to France\u2019s postwar baby boom. In one 1950 survey, for example, 97 per cent of respondents agreed that family allowances encouraged a higher birthrate. Yet scholars are unconvinced that these benefits actually explain France\u2019s postwar baby boom. Similar demographic phenomena were recorded in most western countries after the war, including in countries such as the US that did not deploy a pro-natalist strategy. Significantly, too, while relatively generous family benefits continued beyond the 1960s, France\u2019s postwar baby boom did not.\n As in the US, in France the pandemic has now accelerated what was already a downward trend.

you&#39;re wondering, you&#39;d need about 2000 feature-length movies to occupy that many waking hours.\n Sit back and relax. Jupiter is more than 3 times as far as we just traveled.\n   This is where we might at least see some asteroids to wake us up.  \u00a0 Too bad they&#39;re all too small to appear on this map.\n  If you were on a road trip, driving at 75mi/hr, it would have taken you over 500 years to get here from earth.\n All these distances are just averages, mind you.  \u00a0 The distance between planets really depends on where the two planets are in their orbits around the sun. \u00a0 So if you&#39;re planning on taking a trip to Jupiter, you might want to use a different map.\n If you plan it right, you can actually move relatively quickly between planets. \u00a0 The New Horizons space craft that launched in 2006 only took 13 months to get to Jupiter. \u00a0 Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;ll take a lot less than 13 months to scroll there.\n     I guess this is why most maps of the solar system aren&#39;t drawn to scale. \u00a0  It&#39;s not hard to draw the planets.  \u00a0 It&#39;s the empty space that&#39;s a problem.\n   When it comes to things like the age of the earth, the number of snowflakes in Siberia, the national debt... \u00a0 Those things are too much for our brains to handle.\n We need to reduce things down to something we can see or experience directly in order to understand them.\n We&#39;re always trying to come up with metaphors for big numbers. Even so, they never seem to work.\n  You would need    of these screens lined up side-by-side to show this whole map at once.\n If this map was printed from a quality printer (300 pixels per inch) the earth would be invisible, and the width of the paper would need to be 475 feet. \u00a0 475 feet is about 1 and 1/2 football fields.\n Even though we don\u2019t really understand them, a lot can happen within these massive lengths of time and space. \u00a0  A drop of water can carve out a canyon. \u00a0 An amoeba can become a dolphin. \u00a0 A star can collapse on itself.\n It\u2019s easy to disregard nothingness because there\u2019s no thought available to encapsulate it. There\u2019s no metaphor that fits because, by definition, once the nothingness becomes tangible, it ceases to exist.\n It\u2019s a good thing we have these tiny stars and planets, otherwise we\u2019d have no point of reference at all. \u00a0 We\u2019d be surrounded by this stuff that our minds weren\u2019t built to understand.\n All this emptiness really could drive you nuts. For instance, if you\u2019re in a sensory deprivation tank for too long, your brain starts to make things up. You see and hear things that aren\u2019t there.\n  &#34;Sorry, Humanity,&#34; says Evolution. &#34;What with all the jaguars trying to eat you, the parasites in your fur, and the never-ending need for a decent steak, I was a little busy. I didn\u2019t exactly have time to come up with a way to conceive of vast stretches of nothingness.&#34;\n Neurologically speaking, we really only deal with matter of a certain size, and energy of a few select wavelengths. For everything else, we have to make up mental models and see if they match up to the tiny shreds of hard evidence that actually feel real.\n The mental models provided by mathematics are extremely helpful when trying to make sense of these vast distances, but still... \u00a0 Abstraction is pretty unsatisfying.\n When you hear people talk about how, &#34;there\u2019s more to this universe than our minds can conceive of&#34; it&#39;s usually a way to get you to go along with a half-baked plot point about UFOs or super-powers in a sci-fi series that you&#39;re watching late at night when you can\u2019t get to sleep.\n Even when Shakespeare wrote: &#34;There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy\u201d \u2013 he&#39;s basically trying to give us a loophole to make the ghost in the story more believable.\n But all this empty space, these things of a massive scale, really are more than our minds can conceive of. The maps and metaphors fail to do them justice.\n You look at one tiny dot, then you look for the next tiny dot. Everything in between is inconsequential and fairly boring.\n   If the proton of a hydrogen atom was the size of the sun on this map, we would need 11 more of these maps to show the average distance to the electron.\n Some theories say all this emptiness is actually full of energy or dark matter and that nothing can truly be empty... \u00a0 but come on, only ordinary matter has any meaning for us.\n  If so much of the universe is made up of emptiness, what does that mean to people like us, living on a tiny speck in the middle of all of it?\n  With so much emptiness, aren&#39;t stars, planets, and people just glitches in an otherwise elegant and uniform nothingness, like pieces of lint on a black sweater?\n But without the tiny dots for it to stretch between, there would be no emptiness to measure, and for that matter, no one around to measure it.\n You might say that so much emptiness makes the tiny bits of matter that much more meaningful - simply by the fact that, against all odds, they  aren&#39;t empty. \u00a0 If you&#39;re drowning in the middle of the ocean, a floating piece of driftwood is a pretty big deal.\n What if trillions of stars and planets were crammed right next to each other? They wouldn&#39;t be special at all.\n It seems like we are both pathetically insignificant, and miraculously important at the same time.\n Whether you more strongly feel the monumental significance of tiny things or the massive void between them depends on who you are, and how your brain chemistry is balanced at a particular moment.  We walk around with miniature, emotional versions of the universe inside of us.\n It&#39;s reassuring to know that no matter how depressingly bleak or ridiculously momentous we feel, the universe, judging by its current structure, seems well aware of both extremes.\n The fact that you&#39;re here, in the midst of all this nothing, is pretty amazing when you stop and think about it.\n  Might as well stop now. We&#39;ll need to scroll through 6,771 more maps like this before we see anything else.

The effects of inflation not only are greater, but disproportionately greater, for poorer people. Those with higher incomes often offset price increases (goods, services) with increased income. Furthermore, prices often increase more for basic needs than for luxury items, a phenomenon economists call \u201cinflation inequality.\u201d Simply put, low-income families\u2019 budgets will stress and strain as they confront the coming rising costs of the essentials they need (food, energy, transport, child care).\n  The economic well-being of the most economically vulnerable Americans too often tends to be discussed as a matter of the latest Washington program or policy. Those acting in the name of \u201ceconomic justice\u201d need to pay more attention to basic economic indicators such as employment rates by demographic group, incomes and, yes, inflation, if we want to truly understand what\u2019s happening not just to the economy in a general sense but specifically to the most vulnerable within it.\n  As coming waves of inflation will demonstrate, the fundamentals\u2014and not the latest federal government initiative\u2014will most directly characterize and affect the economic well-being of the most economically vulnerable in our country.\n  You will be charged $  + tax (if applicable) for The Wall Street Journal.

But a growing contingent of medical experts is now questioning whether that conventional wisdom ought to apply to children.\n Their doubts are not borne of conspiracy beliefs, but couched in the carefully calibrated language of risk and benefit. And they&#39;re expected to  get a public airing next week as advisors to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ponder a spate of post-vaccine heart problems in adolescents and young adults.\n No one is arguing that COVID-19 immunizations for kids should stop altogether. Rather, a debate has erupted over the need to inoculate healthy children as soon as possible and according to the two-dose regimen authorized by the Food and Drug Administration.\n  The vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have been administered safely to millions of adults and been vetted in several thousand adolescents. But neither has been subjected to exhaustive testing in diverse pediatric populations, as is typically required for a vaccine intended for universal use in kids.\n The FDA authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for emergency use in adolescents as young as 12 on May 10. In the weeks that have followed, the safety monitoring systems managed by the FDA and CDC detected dozens of cases of a possible side effect in newly vaccinated teens: an inflammation of the heart muscle known as  myocarditis.\n The cases typically developed in older adolescents, most of them boys, three to four days after they got a second dose. Virtually all were considered mild, presenting as chest pain and tightness that resolved after treatment with over-the-counter medications. None of the patients appear to have died or suffered serious cardiac malfunction, though it&#39;s too early to know whether they will suffer long-term effects.\n As of June 10, the government&#39;s vaccine monitoring systems detected 226 cases of myocarditis or a related condition called  pericarditis after vaccination in people younger than 30. Normally, fewer than 100 cases would be expected for this age group, said  Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, deputy director of the CDC&#39;s Immunization Safety Office.\n  More investigation is needed to determine whether the vaccine caused these heart problems or if the timing was merely a coincidence, he said.\n Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine specialist at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the reports will give the CDC\u2019s  Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices an opportunity to \u201cgive people a clinic on relative risk\u201d \u2014 as it did after the COVID-19 vaccine made by Johnson &amp; Johnson was  linked to a rare blood-clotting disorder in younger women but still  deemed safe for use.\n Offit said he doubts the myocarditis cases will upend the long-standing certainty that kids should be vaccinated quickly.\n  Others aren\u2019t so sure. The possibility that children getting the vaccine \u2014 especially a second dose \u2014 could put their hearts at risk has amplified calls for more debate before parents, schools and others embrace the conviction that all healthy children need to get vaccinated.\n  It\u2019s not just the prospect of a surprise side effect that has prompted the sudden surge in vaccine caution.\n As the pandemic appears to be winding down across the United States and its limited toll on children has been tallied, it\u2019s no longer clear that immunizing children will bring the outbreak to a faster close, said  Dr. Martin Makary, a public health expert at Johns Hopkins University.\n Makary is urging his colleagues to \u201cthink twice\u201d before recommending universal COVID-19 vaccination of healthy kids. Given the data in hand, \u201cthere\u2019s no compelling case for it right now,\u201d he  wrote this month in MedPage, a website widely read by physicians.\n In an interview, Makary said his concerns might be allayed with a more thorough examination of the safety data.\n \u201cBut no one is thinking like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve converted now from being pro-vaccine to vaccine fanaticism.\u201d\n Given the general decline in new infections and hospitalizations, there\u2019s time for a thorough FDA vetting of the vaccines for children and adolescents, Makary said. Even if it takes months, it could wind up protecting more children from harm.\n The emerging debate threatens to divide a community that\u2019s largely been united by the pandemic.\n From the moment that the first COVID-19 vaccine started  going into Americans&#39; arms, one certainty has seemed almost beyond questioning: As soon as enough doses were available, the nation\u2019s children would roll up their sleeves.\n  Although it\u2019s clear COVID-19 has largely spared children from severe illness, the CDC says  456 American kids have died of the disease, though that is considered a conservative estimate.\n At least 20,000 \u2014 and as many as 100,000 \u2014 kids have been hospitalized with COVID-19. Indeed, the CDC reports that even as adult hospitalizations declined in March and April, the rate at which adolescents were admitted ticked upward. Nearly one-third were treated in intensive care units, undercutting the argument that severe illness rarely happens in this age group.\n COVID-19\u2019s toll on some children also lingers well beyond a bout of infection. As of mid-May, at least 4,018 in the U.S. have developed a condition called  multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MISC, that frequently appears four to six weeks after a child has cleared his or her infection and typically requires hospitalization.\n  If COVID-19 were a disease seen only in children, statistics such as these would galvanize medical professionals and public health officials to find a way to protect them, New York pediatrician  Dr. Risa Hoshino wrote in a  MedPage commentary sparked in part by Makary\u2019s views.\n By any definition, COVID-19 has been an emergency for the nation\u2019s children and the FDA\u2019s emergency use authorization is an \u201cappropriate pathway\u201d for getting vaccines to young Americans, she added.\n At Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, pediatric cardiologist  Dr. Jodie Votava-Smith has seen the wreckage of COVID-19 firsthand, and she has no doubts about the value of vaccinating kids.\n In the last month, she has helped treat a patient who developed myocarditis after a dose of vaccine, she said. The child\u2019s symptoms were mild and readily treated with ibuprofen.\n Votava-Smith said her assessment of vaccines\u2019 value has been more profoundly shaped by the dozens of children treated at CHLA for serious heart muscle inflammation as a result of having COVID-19. These children were severely ill and now face potentially enduring health effects. The disease was the cause of their misery, she said, not the vaccine.\n The mother of two children who are 5 and 7, Votava-Smith said she \u201ccan\u2019t wait\u201d to get them vaccinated. \u201cThey know they\u2019ll be getting their shot when it\u2019s their turn,\u201d she said.\n Dr. H. Cody Meissner, a Tufts University pediatrician who advises the FDA on vaccines, said it&#39;s a mistake to evaluate COVID-19 vaccines for children in the same way as it was cleared for emergency use in adults.\n \u201cThe risk calculation for vaccinating an adult is pretty easy,\u201d he said. When as many as 4,000 adults a day were dying of COVID-19, \u201ceven if there was a little risk of vaccine, most people would accept that.\u201d\n But for children, he said, \u201cthe calculus is a bit different.\u201d Although they seem to contract the coronavirus pretty readily, they\u2019re far less likely than adults to get sick or die. So even if instances of post-vaccination myocarditis are rare, they still change the risk-benefit analysis.\n \u201cThe data are not sufficient to say that the benefit of these COVID-19 vaccines outweighs the risk in children and adolescents,\u201d Meissner said. \u201cWe may get there. But we\u2019re not there now.\u201d\n  Updates:  8:08 AM, Jun. 18, 2021:  This story originally said the CDC vaccine advisory committee would discuss COVID-19 vaccines for children at a meeting on Friday, June 18.

", "note_en": "Docker Inc. started like many startups with engineers working from a single location. For us, this was in the Bay Area in the US. We were very office-centric, so the natural way to increase diversity and to get engineers from different cultures to work together was to open new offices in diverse locations. Right from the start, our goal was to mix American and European ways of producing software, giving us the best of both cultures.\n  In 2015, Docker started to open offices in Europe, starting with Cambridge in the United Kingdom and followed by Paris in France. With these two locations, the long road to gaining experience working with remote employees began.\n Having multiple offices scattered around the world is different from being fully remote. But you still start experiencing some of the challenges of not having everybody in the same location simultaneously. We spent a great deal of our time on planes or trains visiting each other.\n Despite the robust open-source culture of the company, which shows that you can build great software while not having everybody in the same room, we still had a very office-centric culture. A lot of the context of a given product conversation or decision was linked to a given office. When you were not in the office where the decision was made, you only had partial information about the decision.\n We learned a lot during this time: organizing work effectively and enjoyably while appreciating different cultures, time zones (France and US West Coast are 9 hours apart\u2026), paperwork, salary expectations, public holidays, etc.\n  The products Docker builds have a significant impact on the world, so hiring great engineers has never been a problem at Docker. We were artificially limiting ourselves to hiring talent close to one of our offices. We could open more offices or start hiring people as fully remote wherever they lived. In 2017, we hired a couple of very experienced remote engineers who had 5+ years of experience working remotely. They brought a lot of their best practices, and with them, the company learned how to be better at working with remote engineers.\n One of the areas we made changes was in how we ran meetings. Instead of only having remote employees dial in and struggling to follow conversations in conference rooms, we got everyone, even those in offices, to dial in with a good headset so that everyone was on the same level. This drastically improves the quality of meetings for those who are remote.\n We also learned the power of good writing as time zones forced communication to be more asynchronous. Concise, clear, and effective, writing became critical.\n We worked hard on our company core values, one of them is \u201cOpen Collaboration\u201d. Following that value, we started to close 1600+ slack channels to concentrate our communication around just a few dozen. We advocated for communication to happen in public slack channels by default and limiting the usage of private channels to only when necessary.\n Remote engineers felt better, but there was still a life in the office they couldn\u2019t grasp, this is when we introduced  Wormholes. Wormholes are pretty low-tech, they are a monitor, a camera, and speakers open in the offices all day. Remote engineers connect to it, have a view of the offices, and can feel the ambiance and hear general conversations. They can also slack someone to come close to the wormhole for \u201cdirect\u201d communication. They were pretty popular until we left our offices to start working from home.\n  In early 2020, once we were pretty experienced at remote working, we advocated for all positions to be open in any country that we had legal entities, making it easier for us to hire good talent.\n Then Covid hit us along with everyone else. Relatively confident in our experience of working remotely, we thought that we were more ready than others to have everyone working at home. We quickly realized that working remotely and working remotely through a pandemic are not the same at all.\n While we had the software and culture to embrace a remote-first workforce, the pandemic itself brought new challenges. Not being able to see each other in the office or family and relatives for such a long time has taken a toll on everybody. This also highlighted inequality that we didn\u2019t realize before: people with small apartments, young kids, or living alone were hit harder than those living with relatives and enjoying a large house.\n These hard-learned lessons fueled the way we shape the future of work at Docker. Giving employees help to set up their home office, helping them move from one city to another, and generally spending enough time and energy making sure everybody is comfortable as we transition to this exciting new future of work.\n  While other companies are pushing their employees to get back to offices, we decided that there is no turning back for Docker Inc. and that we will stay remote-first. All of our offices are closed and will remain so.

We wish you a long and healthy life. 100 years and more!\n You have probably seen the evolution of CPUs \u2013 from 16-bit to 32-bit CPUs and later from 32-bit to 64-bit CPUs. The logical question arises \u2013 when will 128-bit processors arrive?\n 128-bit CPU, when talking about computer architecture, means that this processor must have 128-bit integers and a 128-bit bus. It is not x2 better than 64-bit. It is not that simple at all.\n While in the past there was a need to address more memory, the current 64-bit CPUs can handle so much RAM that you can\u2019t even imagine. To be precise, the amount is 2^64 bytes or 18.44 exabytes. 1 exabyte is 1 billion gigabytes! You won\u2019t see this amount of RAM probably ever in your life. 4 Gb for a 32-bit system can be sufficient or 8 Gb for normal office work on a 64-bit OS would also work. Some cutting edge devices have 64 Gb or even 128 Gb, but this is required in very few situations like heavy CAT applications or video editing.\n We are currently using 64-bit processors, but usually, the bus is not 64 bits. More like 40-bit or 48-bit. This characteristic still has the possibility to improve.\n Going to a 128-bit CPU from a 64-bit one will require more memory. We will need a huge cache size. Otherwise, the program will just run slowlier.\n It will require a lot more power. Such a processor will be significantly bigger in size and it will release more heat too. This can be very impractical. Literally nobody wants bigger and heavier devices.\n The price per wat will also be too expensive. It will be far costlier to create a 128-bit CPU.\n Another disadvantage will be the need for a 128-bit OS and drivers. It will be pointless if such a processor can\u2019t be properly utilized. For now neither Microsoft nor Apple are even thinking of creating such an OS.\n One of the executives of ARM stated that the company \u201chas no plans for 128-bit ARM-based chips because they simply aren\u2019t needed.\u201d\n Surely one day, after many, many years we will start using 128-bits processors, but obviously, it won\u2019t be soon.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 04:30:02", "source_domain":

criteria for the adoption of the currency.\n Previous roadmap required that all member countries met three primary criteria for the adoption of the currency.\n That included member countries having a budget deficit of not more than 3 percent; average annual inflation of less than 10 percent with a long-term goal of not more than 5 percent.\n Countries were expected to also have gross reserves that can finance at least three months of imports.\n  The other convergence criteria that was adopted by ECOWAS was public debt or Gross Domestic Product of not more than 70 percent.\n There was also the issue of central banks financing budget deficit not more than 10 percent of previous year\u2019s tax revenue, and nominal exchange rate variation of plus or minus 10 percent.\n Majority of the member

", "note_en": "The city of Stockton, California, embarked on a bold experiment two years ago: It decided to distribute  $500 a month to 125 people for 24 months \u2014 with no strings attached and no work requirements. The people were randomly chosen from neighborhoods at or below the city\u2019s median household income, and they were free to spend the money any way they liked. Meanwhile, researchers studied what impact the cash had on their lives.\n The  results from the first year of the experiment, which spanned from February 2019 to February 2020, are now in. And they\u2019re extremely encouraging for its participants, and for advocates who see unconditional cash transfers as an effective way to help people escape poverty.\n The most eye-popping finding is that the people who received the cash managed to secure full-time jobs at more than twice the rate of people in a control group, who did not receive cash.  Within a year, the proportion of cash recipients who had full-time jobs jumped from 28 percent to 40 percent. The control group saw only a 5 percent jump over the same period.\n The researchers  wrote in their report that the money gave recipients the stability they needed to set goals, take risks, and find new jobs. One man in his 30s had been eligible for a real estate license for over a year but hadn\u2019t gotten it because he just couldn\u2019t afford to take time off work. Thanks to the freedom offered by the extra $500 per month, he said, his life was \u201cconverted 360 degrees \u2026 because I have more time and net worth to study \u2026 to achieve my goals.\u201d\n  Critics of cash assistance programs often  say that handing out \u201cfree money\u201d will make people less inclined to find jobs. But in the research done to date, unconditional cash does not tend to disincentivize work. In several programs \u2014 from Alaska and North Carolina in the US, to  Finland and Spain in Europe \u2014 it has had no effect on employment either way. In some cases, it seems to embolden people with an entrepreneurial bent; for instance, in Japan,  initial survey results have shown that recipients are 3.9 times more interested in launching a new business.\n Employment aside, there are clear benefits to unconditional cash programs. The Stockton experiment \u2014 which was conducted as a randomized controlled trial and underwent an independent evaluation \u2014 adds to the growing body of evidence from  basic income experiments around the world, which shows that getting unconditional cash tends to boost  happiness,  health,  school attendance, and  trust in social institutions, while  reducing crime.\n   There were other benefits from the Stockton program. Cash recipients reported being less anxious and depressed than the control group. On average, the recipients \u201cexperienced clinically and statistically significant improvements in their mental health that the control group did not \u2014 moving from likely having a mild mental health disorder to likely mental wellness over the year-long intervention,\u201d according to the researchers.\n The cash also  enabled recipients to help their family and friends. For example, one woman used the cash to help her siblings buy school clothes for their kids and to help her daughter-in-law pay for car insurance. Another bought diapers for her grandchildren.\n This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen cash programs have positive ripple effects on the broader community. In Kenya, cash transfers have stimulated the economy and   benefited not only the recipients themselves but also people in nearby villages.\n It\u2019s worth noting a wrinkle in the Stockton trial:  Each participant was given $500 per month on a debit card so that researchers would be able to see how they were using the money. However, 40 percent of it was either withdrawn as cash or transferred to an existing bank account, so researchers had to rely on participants to tell them where the money went.\n Of the money tracked on the debit cards, recipients spent most on necessities like food (37 percent), home goods and clothes (22 percent), utilities (11 percent), and car costs (10 percent). They spent less than 1 percent on alcohol or cigarettes.\n Though these numbers can\u2019t capture the full picture, they offer a counter to harmful stereotypes and faulty assumptions: that people who become poor get that way because they\u2019re bad at rational decision-making and self-control, and that they\u2019ll blow free money on frivolous things or addictive substances. The  evidence  does not support these beliefs.\n The Stockton experiment was a small study with only 125 cash recipients, so the findings should be seen as offering supporting evidence on the effectiveness of cash programs rather than as definitive standalone proof. Nevertheless,  the results of this philanthropically funded program \u2014 officially known as the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED), which received a $1 million grant from the Economic Security Project \u2014 help underscore that poverty is a lack of cash, not character, and usefully add to the body of evidence that free money doesn\u2019t disincentivize employment \u2014 it can actually boost it.\n   The message that free money can actually improve job prospects comes at a critical moment, as the  Biden administration tries to push through a pandemic aid package that would include direct checks to millions of Americans.\n The pandemic has made the idea of direct payments more popular. With the Covid-19 crisis generating so much financial loss and uncertainty, advocates have argued that citizens desperately need some sort of income floor. And against this backdrop, SEED has spawned something much bigger:  Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, a  coalition of mayors who are pushing for the US to implement a federal guaranteed income. Both SEED and the mayoral  coalition are the brainchild of Michael Tubbs, the former mayor of Stockton.\n For years now, Tubbs has promoted the idea that a guaranteed income could transform life for Stockton residents, but he\u2019s also made clear this experiment is about a lot more than just his city. \u201cStockton is a proxy for America: its diversity, its people,\u201d he  said. \u201cIt\u2019s a place that\u2019s emerging and has big, bold ideas.\u201d\n Guaranteed income is a big, bold idea that could improve life for millions of Americans if implemented more widely. That said, it\u2019s not a cure-all for the systemic obstacles that keep people from a healthy, stable life.\n As the SEED researchers wrote in their report, \u201cGuaranteed income should not be considered as a singular approach for household stability, but rather as one policy option to be implemented alongside others to shore up market failures.\u201d Other policy options include increasing the supply of affordable housing and raising the minimum wage.\n For now, only the first year\u2019s worth of data from the Stockton experiment is available; we have to wait until 2022 for the full results. But the first-year findings signal that guaranteed income programs \u2014 combined with better public policy \u2014 could go a long way toward fighting poverty.\n   Millions turn to Vox to understand what\u2019s happening in the news.

", "note_en": "I recently spent some time going through the amazing nand2tetris course, and assignment #9 is to implementsomething with the Jack programming language that runs on the Hack computer. Myfriend encouraged me to try writing a raytracer, which is an algorithm thatgenerates physically realistic images by simulating light bouncing off ofobjects. The output of the raytracer is a beautiful image with shadows,reflections, and other physical phenomena. Implementing a raytracer requires abit of math and linear algebra, and it seemed like a fun challenge to writesomething complex with the limited capabilities of the Jack\u00a0language.\n I\u2019d like to share my approach and the challenges I faced reimplementing my ownmath system and optimizing a Jack program with limited tools. Though you maynever need to do this, you might learn a lot about how computers perform math,and gain an appreciation for math\u00a0libraries!\n  First, I looked at what the Jack language had to offer. I knew that debuggingwould be really challenging, so I was looking for how easy it would be to debug,print logging statements, and set\u00a0breakpoints.\n The answer was: not very easy. The system has a 512x256 black and white screen,and when you use  Output.printString to print stuff to it, it\u2019s emitted ontothe screen, not to a separate terminal, and it doesn\u2019t scroll very well. You canset breakpoints, but it\u2019s a little tricky to step into and out of functions. Forexample, here\u2019s printing \u201cHello world\u201d to the\u00a0screen.\n  This, along with performance concerns, led me to consider writing a testimplementation of the raytracer, so that I could practice the implementation,iterate quickly, and get it working before translating it to Jack. I chose Rustfor this because I\u2019ve always wanted to learn Rust, and because it seemed like agood fit. Rust has precise control over copying semantics and int sizes,automatic memory management, immutability-first coding, and handy features likeoverflow detection for\u00a0ints.\n  To write the Rust raytracer, I mostly followed this awesome blog postwith some simplifications and modifications for the Hack computer. Since it hasa 512x256 black and white screen (no grayscale), the output fidelity is prettylimited, so I chose not to implement the fancier stuff like reflections, sinceit wouldn\u2019t be very visible anyways. Secondly, I only needed to do all colorcomputations in a single channel, since I don\u2019t have colors. Finally, I knew I\u2019dneed some sort of  dithering algorithmto convert the grayscale output of the raytracer into black and white pixels ina nice-looking\u00a0way.\n You\u2019d think I\u2019d just be able to follow the tutorial, make these changes, rendera beautiful image, and start working on this blog post, but that wasn\u2019t thecase. First, I had to solve an arguably even harder problem: the fact that Jackhas no decimal point type, only whole integers. Furthermore, the only numbertype that Jack supports is a signed 16-bit integer ( i16 in Rust), which storesvalues from -32768 to 32767. This.. is not very big. Put it this way: you canoverflow this value by multiplying 200 by\u00a0200.\n In order to implement a raytracer, you need a fairly complete math library,including multiplication, division, square roots, and \u03c0. Jack has  Math.sqrt,but it only works on the native  int type and truncates to the nearest  int.\n Of course, Rust has all the math functions I need, but it wouldn\u2019t be a verygood test implementation if I used Rust-specific functions. Therefore, I neededto use only the parts of Rust that exist in Jack, and implement the new partsmyself in order to port them to\u00a0Jack.\n So, before writing a single line of raytracer code, I needed to write my ownnumerical type that was big enough to support the range and precision I wanted.I decided to break this into two steps: implementing a big enough  Int class,then implementing a decimal point type on top of it using fixed-point arithmetic.\n  The idea behind fixed point arithmetic is that you can use some storage to storedata after the decimal point. Switching to standard base 10 for a second,consider a scenario where I only have 5 digits for storage. I can either use itto store 0 to 99999, or I could mentally insert a decimal point after the thirddigit, which lets me store 0 to 999.99. In this case, I have three digits ofrange and two digits of precision. To actually store the data, I multiply by100, which is known as the scaling factor because you store  X * 100 torepresent  X: 34832 for 348.32, etc. When the scaling factor is 100, theprecision is 0.01, because your system\u2019s smallest increment is in steps of 0.01,and anything smaller is\u00a0lost.\n  When the scaling factor is higher, you can store higher-precision decimals, butyou lose overall range. For example, with a scaling factor of 1000, which meansyou store 34832 for 34.832, you now have three digits of decimals, but only twodigits before the decimal point, so your range is now only 0\u201199.\n The overall idea idea is that you have to allocate your five digits to eitherstoring pre- or post- decimal point digits, and it\u2019s a tradeoff between rangeand precision. I\u2019ll go into this more\u00a0later!\n  Returning to building the  Int class, the main technique for doing this is tostore an array of integers. The first integer is the least significant chunk,the next one is the next significant chunk, etc. It\u2019s just like the way one usesdigits to express larger\u00a0numbers.\n   In my Rust implementation, I use  i16s (signed 16-bit integers) for everyinteger, because I wanted to simulate the equivalent Jack type  int.\n   This is a struct with an array of four  i16s. I called it  Int32 because Ithought a signed 32-bit integer would be enough range to support all the math Ineeded. It needs to support decimals in the future, and as mentioned above, Ineed to allocate these 32 bits to store data either before or after the decimalpoint. I\u2019ll go into this more in the next section. For now, we only need toconcern ourselves for implementing math on this  Int32 class.\n You might notice that I seem to have more data than I need: an array of four i16s is 64 bits of information, not 32. This is true. I deliberately left thetop eight bits of each  i16 empty, which means that each  i16 is in the rangeof  [0, 255]. I did this for a few\u00a0reasons:\n I\u2019ll need to use  i16 math to implement  Int32 math, and it\u2019s really helpfulto have some room for overflow. For example, if I use the entire  i16 range,and eventually add 30000 to 5000, it will overflow and wrap around to -30534,which is not desirable. Instead, if I only use the \u201cbottom\u201d half of the  i16,which stores 0 to 255, I can add 200 to 100 and get 300, then manually handlethe overflow myself.\n Jack has no unsigned integer, which makes the math troublesome. Most of thealgorithms that I\u2019m about to use only work on unsigned integers. Rather thantrying to make them work with signed integers, I decided to artificially limitthe size to pretend I had an unsigned integer. In other words, I can use a i16 to pretend to be a  u8 (unsigned 8-bit integer), because the range [0, 255] fits comfortably inside the range  [-32768, 32767].\n Assuming I don\u2019t use the top eight bits of each  i16, then each  i16contributes eight bits, and  8 * 4 = 32. Yay! Let\u2019s start working on the\u00a0math.\n  Most systems store negative numbers using a technique called two\u2019s complement. If you havean unsigned 3-bit integer, as you count from  000 to  111, the integers gofrom 0 to 7. But for a signed 3-bit integer stored as two\u2019s complement, as youcount from  000 to  111, the integers go from 0 to 3, then wrap around to -4,then count up to -1. This slices the available range in half, but allows you tostore negative\u00a0numbers!\n   Addition and subtraction \u201cjust work\u201d with positive and negative numberswithout having to do anything special. For example, 2 (010) + -4 (100) = 110, which corresponds to -2.\n It\u2019s easy to see if a number is negative: check if the most significant bit(farthest to the left) is 1.\n To implement negation in 2\u2019s complement, flip all the bits and add one. Here\u2019swhat that looks\u00a0like:\n pub   fn  do_neg( &amp; mut  self)  {    // Flip each integer. We need to AND with 0xFF to get rid of all the    // bits past the 8th bit, because those bits always need to be 0.   self.parts[ 0]   =   !self.parts[ 0]   &amp;   0xFF;   self.parts[ 1]   =   !self.parts[ 1]   &amp;   0xFF;   self.parts[ 2]   =   !self.parts[ 2]   &amp;   0xFF;   self.parts[ 3]   =   !self.parts[ 3]   &amp;   0xFF;     // Add one, and handle carry.   self.parts[ 0]   +=   1;     if  self.parts[ 0]   &gt;=   256  {   self.parts[ 0]   -=   256;   self.parts[ 1]   +=   1;   }     if  self.parts[ 1]   &gt;=   256  {   self.parts[ 1]   -=   256;   self.parts[ 2]   +=   1;   }     if  self.parts[ 2]   &gt;=   256  {   self.parts[ 2]   -=   256;   self.parts[ 3]   +=   1;   }     if  self.parts[ 3]   &gt;=   256  {   self.parts[ 3]   -=   256;   }  }\n You might notice I implemented this as a mutative function, rather thanreturning a new  Int32 with the negative result. This is a deliberate choice toavoid extra allocations. By reusing the same struct, I don\u2019t need to allocatemore memory for every math operation, and I\u2019ll be using these a  lot. Thismight be penny-pinching in Rust, but it was an absolute lifesaver for Jack. Ialso didn\u2019t use Rust\u2019s operator overloading, since Jack doesn\u2019t have\u00a0thatfeature.\n  As mentioned above, addition and subtraction are fairly easy in a two\u2019scomplement world. Like school math, you add each component and carry over to thenext higher chunk if\u00a0needed.\n  pub   fn  do_add( &amp; mut  self,  other:  &amp; Int32)  {   self.parts[ 0]   +=  other.parts[ 0];   self.parts[ 1]   +=  other.parts[ 1];   self.parts[ 2]   +=  other.parts[ 2];   self.parts[ 3]   +=  other.parts[ 3];     if  self.parts[ 0]   &gt;=   256  {   self.parts[ 0]   -=   256;   self.parts[ 1]   +=   1;   }     if  self.parts[ 1]   &gt;=   256  {   self.parts[ 1]   -=   256;   self.parts[ 2]   +=   1;   }     if  self.parts[ 2]   &gt;=   256  {   self.parts[ 2]   -=   256;   self.parts[ 3]   +=   1;   }     if  self.parts[ 3]   &gt;=   256  {   self.parts[ 3]   -=   256;   }  }\n  Remember that  parts[0] is the least significant chunk and  parts[3] is themost significant. This is also an example of how having that extra space in the i16 allows me to add two numbers in the  [0, 255] range without fear of  i16overflow.\n  Here\u2019s where it got trickier. Multiplication can be done just like the schooltechnique, where you multiply each pair of digits and offset\u00a0accordingly.\n  I took the algorithm from this post andadapted it to Rust (and later Jack). However, I ran into two\u00a0issues.\n First, I only adapted the unsigned version of the algorithm for simplicity. Thatmeans I needed to handle signs myself. Luckily, this is not too\u00a0bad:\n If either side was negative (i.e. if  A is negative ^ B is negative = true),negate the result.\n Secondly, I ran into integer sizing problems again during the implementation.The original implementation multiplies  unsigned shorts (or  u16 in Rust), anduses a temporary  unsigned int ( u32) to store the result. This is necessary,because multiplication is a range-expanding operation. For example, if youmultiply any two two-digit numbers, the result will be at most 4 digits. In thesame way, to properly fit the results of  u16 * u16, you need a  u32.\n  This is bad news for us because we only have one size, the  i16. You mightthink we could make this work because we secretly only use the bottom half, asmentioned above. However, even that doesn\u2019t\u00a0work.\n Since we\u2019re using just the bottom half of the  i16, it has a range of [0, 255]. What happens when we multiply 255 by 255? We get 65,025, whichdoesn\u2019t fit in a  i16 (range  [-32768, 32767]). Sad times! This makes sensebecause the  [0, 255] range is represented by the type  u8, and if youmultiply two  u8s, you get a  u16, which has the range  [0, 65535]. All wehave is  i16 (range  [-32768, 32767]), which doesn\u2019t fit :( This is a casewhere having an unsigned integer type in Jack would really help, but alas, we\u00a0donot.\n How do we fix this one? The answer is to subdivide again. Before performing themultiplication algorithm, we expand the array of four 8-bit chunks into eight4-bit chunks. Each 8-bit chunk is split into two 4-bit chunks, one with thelower four bits and one with the higher four\u00a0bits.\n let  self_parts_expanded: [ i16;   8]   =  [   self_parts[ 0]   &amp;   0x0F,   arith_rightshift(self_parts[ 0],   4),   self_parts[ 1]   &amp;   0x0F,   arith_rightshift(self_parts[ 1],   4),   self_parts[ 2]   &amp;   0x0F,   arith_rightshift(self_parts[ 2],   4),   self_parts[ 3]   &amp;   0x0F,   arith_rightshift(self_parts[ 3],   4),  ];\n  Now, we can use our multiplication algorithm on these 4-bit chunks, knowing thata unsigned 4-bit multiplication will result in a  u8, which fits inside our i16.\u00a0Huzzah!\n // Top 12 bits of each i16 should be empty, so read it like a &#34;u4&#34;. // We&#39;re simulating Jack which only has i16.  fn  u4_array_mul_u4_array(u:  &amp;[ i16;   8],  v:  &amp;[ i16;   8])  -&gt; [ i16;   16]  {    let   mut  w   =  [ 0 i16;   16];     for  j   in   0.. 8  {    let   mut  carry   =   0;    let  vj   =  v[j];    for  i   in   0.. 8  {    // Perform signed 16-bit math that will never overflow    // because we only put u4s into it! u4 * u4 = u8, which    // fits in a i16. We can&#39;t do use u8s because u8 * u8 =    // u16 and u16s don&#39;t fit in i16.    let  t   =  u[i]   *  vj   +  w[i   +  j]   +  carry;     // Bottom half of the multiply goes into the result; top    // half becomes carry for the next round.   w[i   +  j]   =  t   &amp;   0x0F;   carry   =  arith_rightshift(t,   4);   }   w[j   +   8]   =  carry;   }    w  }\n The result is generated in 4-bit chunks, so we need to combine each pair backinto one 8-bit chunk, which I won\u2019t show\u00a0here.\n Notice that I use a function to perform the right shift, rather than Rust\u2019snative  &gt;&gt;. This is again because Jack doesn\u2019t have a right shift operator, soI have to implement\u00a0it.\n // Jack doesn&#39;t have these, so we need to reimplement them.  fn  arith_rightshift(x:  i16,  n:  i16)  -&gt;  i16 {    let   mut  r   =  x;     for  _   in   0..n  {    let  divided   =  r   /   2;    // Negative numbers round away from 0, not towards 0.   r   =   if  r   &lt;   0   &amp;&amp;  divided   *   2   !=  r  {   divided   -   1   }   else  {   divided   }   }    r  }\n   Division is similar to multiplication, but a little more complicated. Just likemultiplication, I translated the code from this page. Thegeneral gist is also similar to grade school long division, where you generateeach quotient digit one by one, multiply the quotient digit by the divisor, andsubtract it from the\u00a0dividend.\n  We use the same technique of taking the absolute value before performing thealgorithm and then negating the result if exactly one of the inputs is\u00a0odd.\n As for the overflow issue, we need to break each 8-bit chunk into two 4-bitchunks, just like multiplication. The difference is that multiplication goeslike this:  8 chunks * 8 chunks =&gt; 16 chunks, while division performs theinverse:  16 chunks / 8 chunks = 8 chunks. I won\u2019t show the code here, but itjust means the input and output array sizes are\u00a0different.\n  There are many ways to compute square roots, and most of them involve some sortof converging formula that you run until you have the desired accuracy. I chosethe  Babylonian method forsimplicity. To compute the square root of  x:\n Average  guess and  x / guess to get a closer estimate of the square root,and update  guess.\n All of this is done with integer math, so it\u2019ll find the closest integer\u00a0squareroot.\n   pub   fn  do_sqrt( &amp; mut  self)  {    if  self.is_negative()  {   panic !();   }     if  self.is_zero()  {    return;   }     let   mut  guess   =  Int32::from( 5);    for  _   in   0.. 20  {    let   mut  inv   =   *self;   inv.do_div( &amp;guess);    guess.do_add( &amp;inv);   guess.do_div( &amp;Int32::from( 2));   }    self.parts   =  guess.parts;  }\n For simplicity, I started with a guess of  5 and ran 20 iterations every time.We\u2019ll talk about optimizations\u00a0later.\n Hooray, we finished our  Int32 implementation! You can see the final code here,along with unit tests. Now, we\u2019ll move on to implementing fixed\u2011pointarithmetic.\n  As mentioned above, fixed-point arithmetic involves using a whole number toencode a decimal by multiplying the decimal by a scale factor and storing theresulting\u00a0number.\n  Sometimes, a syntax like  Q15.17 is used to describe this scheme. The  Q15.17format is 32 bits (15 + 17) and uses 15 bits for pre-decimal point data and 17bits for post-decimal point data. For example, the old game Quake used  Q16.16for all of its code because the computers at that time didn\u2019t have fast floatingpoint math\u00a0yet.\n If  Q16.16 was good enough for Quake, it\u2019s probably good enough for me, so Ithought I\u2019d do the same. This means I\u2019ll use 16 bits for post-decimal pointdata, which means the scale factor will be  2^16 = 65536, and I\u2019ll be able tostore a decimal point number from -32768 to 32767, with precisions of 1/65536,or\u00a00.00001525878.\n As a result of this scheme, it happens that the top two  i16s in the  Int32parts array will be for pre-decimal point data, and the bottom two forpost-decimal point\u00a0data.\n  Now, we\u2019ll talk about how to implement fixed-point math, using what we\u00a0builtearlier.\n  To construct a  Number from a regular int, we need to wrap it in a  Int32,then multiply it by the scale\u00a0factor:\n  I wrote a handy function on  Int32 to handle the shift left for us. Shiftingleft by 2 bytes is the same as multiplying by  2^16, the scale\u00a0factor.\n  Addition and subtraction are fairly easy, because adding or subtracting two Numbers that have the same scale factor is as simple as performing theoperation on their backing  Int32s.\n pub   fn  do_add( &amp; mut  self,  other:  &amp; Number)  {   self. 0.do_add( &amp;other. 0);  }    pub   fn  do_sub( &amp; mut  self,  other:  &amp; Number)  {   self. 0.do_sub( &amp;other. 0);  }\n  To multiply two fixed numbers, we can multiply their backing  Int32s. However,the resulting number will have an extra multiply by the scale factor, so we needto divide by the scale factor afterwards to cancel it\u00a0out.\n   This poses a serious issue. If we try to do  2 * 2 in our fixed math, theunderlying  Int32s will perform  131072 * 131072, which will overflow the Int32\u2019s max of 2,147,483,647 ( 2^31 - 1).\n We could consider dividing by the scale factor prior to multiplying, but thishas the serious disadvantage of throwing away all of the post-decimal pointinformation of one of the\u00a0multiplicands.\n  To solve this, I realized that the output of the multiplication function iseight chunks of eight bits, but we can only store the bottom four chunks ofeight bits, so we normally ignore the top four\u00a0chunks.\n  However, if the multiplication function takes a \u201cbytes to right shift\u201d argument,it can read from higher chunks and change the information that is ignored. Forexample, if  right_shift_bytes is  0, it reads from result chunks  0-3. Ifit\u2019s  1, it reads from result chunks  1-4. This technique allows us to fusethe multiply and divide together to avoid losing information in between. Thedivide is accomplished by the right shift, because right shifting the parts by 1is equivalent to dividing by 256 (8\u00a0bits).\n   Conveniently, since we chose a scale factor that aligns with our array scheme,we can pass  2 as  right_shift_bytes and get the desired\u00a0result.\n  Division is similar to multiplication, but we need to multiply by the scalefactor beforehand to avoid an extra scale factor in the\u00a0denominator.\n   But just like multiplication, we can bundle the multiplication with the divisionto avoid loss of precision or overflow. The result is  do_left_shift_bytes_div:\n   Just like multiplication and division, square roots involve performing theunderlying  Int32 operation and correcting the scale factor.

From the perspective of a programmer, SSDs and disks look very similar: both are persistent, enable page-based access through file systems and system calls, and have large capacities.  However, there are also important differences, which become important if one wants to achieve optimal SSD performance. As we will see, SSDs are more complicated and their performance behavior can appear quite mysterious if one simply thinks of them as fast disks. The goal of this post is to provide an understanding of why SSDs behave the way they do, which can help creating software that is capable of exploiting them. (Note that I discuss NAND flash, not Intel Optane memory, which has different characteristics.)\n  SSDs are often referred to as disks, but this is misleading as they store data on semiconductors instead of a mechanical disk. To read or write from a random block, a disk has to mechanically move its head to the right location, which takes on the order of 10ms. A random read from an SSD, in contrast, takes about 100us \u2013 100 times faster. This low read latency is the reason why booting from an SSD is so much faster than booting from a disk.\n  Another important difference between disks and SSDs is that disks have one disk head and perform well only for sequential accesses. SSDs, in contrast, consist of dozens or even hundreds of flash chips (&#34;parallel units&#34;), which can be accessed concurrently.  SSDs transparently stripe larger files across the flash chips at page granularity, and a hardware prefetcher ensures that sequential scans exploit all available flash chips. However, at the flash level there is not much difference between sequential and random reads. Indeed, for most SSDs it is possible to achieve almost the full bandwidth with random page reads as well. To do this, one has to schedule hundreds of random IO requests concurrently in order to keep all flash chips busy. This can be done by starting lots of threads or using asynchronous IO interfaces such as libaio or io_uring.\n  Things get even more interesting with writes. For example, if one looks at write latency, one may measure results as low as 10us \u2013 10 times faster than a read. However, latency only appears so low because SSDs are caching writes on volatile RAM. The actual write latency of NAND flash is about 1ms \u2013 10 times slower than a read. On consumer SSDs, this can be measured by issuing a sync/flush command after the write to ensure that the data is persistent on flash. On most data center/server SSDs, write latency cannot be measured directly: the sync/flush will complete immediately because a battery guarantees persistence of the write cache even in the case of power loss.   To achieve high write bandwidth despite the relatively high write latency, SSDs use the same trick as reads: they access multiple flash chips concurrently. Because the the write cache can asynchronously write pages, it is not even necessary to schedule that many writes simultaneously to get good write performance. However, the write latency cannot always be hidden completely: for example, because a write occupies a flash chip 10 times longer a read, writes cause significant tail latencies for reads to the same flash chip.\n  Our understanding is missing one important fact: NAND flash pages cannot be overwritten. Page writes can only be performed sequentially within blocks that have been erased beforehand. These erase blocks have a size of multiple MB and therefore consist of hundreds of pages. On a new SSD, all blocks are erased, and one can directly start appending new data.  Updating pages, however, is not so easy. It would be too expensive to erase the entire block just to overwrite a single page in-place. Therefore, SSDs perform page updates by writing the new version of the page to a new location. This means that the logical and physical pages addresses are decoupled. A mapping table, which is stored on the SSD, translates logical (software) addresses to physical (flash) locations. This component is also called Flash Translation Layer (FTL).  For example, let&#39;s assume we have a (toy) SSD with 3 erase blocks, each with 4 pages. A sequence of writes to pages P1, P2, P0, P3, P5, P1 may result in the following physical SSD state:\n    Using the mapping table and out-of-place write, everything is good until the SSD runs out of free blocks. The old version of overwritten pages must eventually be reclaimed. If we continue our example from above by writing to pages P3, P4, P7, P1, P6, P2, we get the following situation:    At this point we have no more free erase blocks (even though logically there should still be space). Before one can write another page, the SSD first has to erase a block. In the example, it might be best for the garbage collector to erase block 0, because only one of its pages is still in use. After erasing block 0, we make space for 3 writes and our SSD looks like this:\n  To garbage collect block 0, we had to physically move page P0, even though logically nothing happened with that page. In other words, with flash SSDs the number of physical (flash) writes is generally higher than the number of logical (software) writes. The ratio between the two is called write amplification. In our example, to make space for 3 new pages in block 0, we had to move 1 page. Thus we have 4 physical writes for 3 logical writes, i.e., a write amplification of 1.33.  High write amplification decreases performance and reduces flash lifetime. How large write amplification is depends on the access pattern and how full the SSD is. Large sequential writes have low write amplification, while random writes are the worst case.  Let&#39;s assume our SSD is filled to 50% and we perform random writes. In steady state, wherever we erase a block, about half the pages of that block are still in use and have to be copied on average. Thus, write amplification for a fill factor of 50% is 2. In general, worst-case write amplification for a fill factor f is 1/(1-f):     Because write amplification becomes unreasonably high for fill factors close to 1, most SSDs have hidden spare capacity. This overprovisioning is typically 10-20% of the total capacity. Of course, it is also easy to add more overprovisioning by creating an empty partition and never write to it.\n  SSDs have become quite cheap and they have very high performance. For example, a Samsung PM1733 server SSD costs about 200 EUR per TB and promises close to 7 GB/s read and 4 GB/s write bandwidth. Actually achieving such high performance requires knowing how SSD work and this post described the most important behind-the-scenes mechanisms of flash SSDs.  I tried to keep this post short, which meant that I had to simplify things. To learn more, a good starting point is  this tutorial, which also references some insightful papers. Finally, because SSDs have become so fast, the operating system I/O stack is often the performance bottleneck.

", "note_en": "Note: I\u2019m writing this as a former employee (as of June 2021) of Autodesk. My views are entirely my own, based on my recollections and personal experiences during my time with the company.\n I\u2019ve been working with the  Shotgun team in various capacities for t  he past 7 years, shortly after it was acquired by  Autodesk. The first few months I worked with the team, people would ask me what it was like, and I\u2019d always answer \u201cabsolutely everyone is super-smart, it\u2019s really weird\u201d. Practically everyone who was there back then has now moved onto other things outside of Autodesk, but I stay in touch with many of them and miss working with them all greatly.\n Today I read  this post (warning: the language used in the post is quite strong). It\u2019s the kind of thing no Product Manager wants to read, as it signifies us having failed our users. It made me reflect on how things have changed both in the company and how those changes have manifested in the formerly beloved product itself over the past few years.\n When I started, the feeling within the Shotgun team was one of a startup embedded within a larger corporation. We had a great deal of autonomy, and I spent the first few months blissfully unaware of what most of the rest of Autodesk was doing. We were focused on one thing, and that singular purpose, combined with the fact that most of the team (myself included) had been plucked out of the industry we were now serving, meant that all of us cared deeply about the work we were doing. Customer pain wasn\u2019t a cliche, it was our pain too. I spent months embedded with people trying to use Shotgun to get their film and episodic shows produced, I was there when things went wrong for them and they lost time or got frustrated. Our company mission was to \u201cget people home in time for dinner\u201d and we all knew how important that was. We had seen people work long hours, sacrificing everything for the sake of a single shot in a piece of media (or had been one of those people). We desperately wanted to succeed.\n  Even when I joined seven years ago, much of the technology used in the web-based product was dated, and many of the design patterns and user interactions were archaic or undercooked in a rush to get them out the door. From a certain perspective, this was a good thing\u2013 the product had product-market fit, and arguably a big part of the reason for that was that its development process was optimised for being responsive to the multitude of varying needs of its customers, not in spending time and energy in polishing features that were good enough. One thing I learned about building B2B software, is that every customer needs different things. So if you have customer A who needs something, then you go and build it as quickly as possible, when customer B comes along with a different problem, you are incentivised in the short term to now go and build the thing customer B needs, rather than iterating on the feature you just made for the benefit of some imaginary future customer. Everyone wants to build software that delights, but doing so often means not doing something else, and when you are trying to make people \u201chappy\u201d and \u201cwilling to pay\u201d, as opposed to \u201cdelighted\u201d, something has to give.\n Years of this mindset had created a product that was feature-rich, had incredible retention, even winning an Academy Award, but was falling apart at the seams from product debt. We had reached a point with the product where whenever we tried to build anything new or otherwise update certain aspects of the software, dozens of unrelated things would break. There was limited test coverage across all the code, and conversely a lot of different ways for users to configure their particular experience. It wasn\u2019t that every instance of Shotgun was unique, but it wasn\u2019t far off.\n It was a problem that always seemed incomprehensible to new leadership. Someone would join the team with the ambition to make us go faster, assuming it was down to lack of motivation or willingness to make changes. I referred to  this excellent article often when I was thinking about this situation, and this graph in particular:\n  We were constantly in the red area of the graph. We had tons of data on what we needed to do with the product, debated furiously about what was the most important of all the things to commit our scarce resources to, because doing anything at all would be extremely challenging and costly; and then failed to execute effectively. That though, was not down to any technical hurdles. It was down to an existential issue.\n  Autodesk is a big corporation, albeit one with less than 10,000 employees globally. It\u2019s best known for AutoCAD, though the overall product portfolio probably numbers in the hundreds. Most of what Autodesk does is serve the architectural, construction and manufacturing industries. A tiny portion of its revenue though, comes from media &amp; entertainment, predominantly high-end 3D content creation and rendering (with Shotgun as the product that focuses on the business functions of those processes). No one seems to know, or at least be able to articulate why it maintains its deathgrip (over time it has acquired many of the dominant products in the space) over a vertical that doesn\u2019t materially factor into the company\u2019s bottom line. We would speculate that there\u2019s the sex appeal (such as it is) of big splashy visual effects showreels in stark contrast to photos of people with hardhats and the umpteenth render of a building exterior in corporate marketing materials. Whatever the reason, we constantly felt that the corporate overlords would at some point decide to cut their losses and drop the entire division. That never happened though. Instead we had a string of reorgs and their corresponding shifts in focus.\n Around three years ago our product group was selected to pilot a new \u201cincubation\u201d process within Autodesk. On paper it was a superb idea- you allow a group to effectively function with the same level of autonomy\u2013 and accountability\u2013 as a startup would. Our goals became growth-based, we had targets and if those targets were successfully met then our \u201cfunding\u201d would increase accordingly.\n The problem though, was that no-one on the team actually cared about growth. \u201cGet people home in time for dinner\u201d had to become something more like \u201cget even more people home at some time\u201d. Our growth targets then just became a means to an end: get more users and then we get permission to do the stuff that we actually felt excited by.\n With all of this came a sense of (in retrospect) unjustified optimism. The team was restructured, some development teams were dropped and more senior managers were hired in their place. The idea was to get them in place for when our team would be able to grow. The only thing we needed to figure out was where to find the growth opportunity.\n The high-end visual effects industry that we dominated is notoriously slow to adapt to change, and operates for the most part on razor-thin margins. There were billions flowing into film and episodic production every year, but there wasn\u2019t (and likely still isn\u2019t) an obvious opportunity to further monetise our existing customers. But there were two bets that might make a difference. First, Shotgun was too hard to get up and running for anyone unfamiliar with it (due to us never having paid back the aforementioned product debt). Fixing this might lead to greater adoption. Second, although Shotgun popular with Producers and Coordinators, Artists didn\u2019t get on well with it. It was estimated that in a given company there were many more artists not using Shotgun than there were people already using it and that winning them over would lead to significant growth.\n We organised around going after those two potential opportunities and then almost immediately ran into trouble. I (along with a couple of other product managers) was involved with solving the ease of use problem. What was easy was identifying the roadblocks and them prioritising their importance. Where we came unstuck was in actually trying to implement viable solutions to those problems. Any single problem we tried to address was going to be a multi-month effort with the team we had and the technical challenges we would have to overcome (and again, in retrospect even those estimates seem woefully optimistic). There was also the problem which no-one really wanted to admit, which was we didn\u2019t have experience of building things that were easy to use (fortunately, for me at least, many of the people we hired over the past couple of years  did have that experience, and I learned a lot from them).\n But we tried, thinking we could tackle smaller line items in shorter time spans and build up a sort of momentum. We budgeted work by the quarter, but the first quarter worth of work stretched out to two quarters, then required further work in addressing regressions, then more regressions. My choice each time was between abandoning the work half-finished and try something else, or else seeing things through to completion. I chose the latter option, because we had a long history of leaving things half-finished, and everyone on the team, and our customers, was pretty tired of it. I still don\u2019t know if it was the right one, but it definitely wasn\u2019t the wrong one.\n Meanwhile, the artist opportunity was pursued by building out a new product from the ground up, using a much more modern technology stack than we were used to. It represented the future, but it also meant that many developers who were experienced with Ruby or C++ had to reskill in a very short space of time. It was hard. The product, Shotgun Create, ultimately launched as a vastly superior (in terms of user experience) alternative to Shotgun\u2019s capabilities for reviewing and approving work. But it was hard to get people to actually use it. For a couple of months or so, everyone across the organisation stopped what they were doing to help out on the adoption push. It was a stressful time for many, and when it was over, had left a deep scar on the team.\n Two opposing schools of thought were forming. In one camp, the only way forward was to completely redesign and rebuild Shotgun from scratch, using modern engineering and design. In the other, we had to make incremental changes, minimizing disruption to users above all else. Both approaches had their pros and cons, but the team couldn\u2019t be aligned to one or the other. From leadership down, we oscillated back and forth between each. During this stormy time, the strategy to improve adoption through changes in the product was jettisoned in favour of a focus on Go To Market, and a number of key people departed the company, either through frustration or having been terminated.\n The result of this was that for the first time the majority of employees on the Shotgun team were not native to the media and entertainment industry. Many of them were willing to learn, and had a strong sense of empathy, but it would take time to build the domain knowledge up. Priorities shifted once more, this time to focus on integrating with the Autodesk corporate machinery. It was a sensible approach, as it would remove things that were bespoke to Shotgun without providing any real benefit, such as billing and sales channels, but it carried a massive opportunity cost, with leadership making it the top priority for us, and requiring a lot of work over a number of months for the team without having anything users would actually care about to show for it. More reorgs happened, as if to drive this point home. The \u201cStreet Team\u201d, a support team comprised of extremely smart and knowledgeable former Shotgun experts and workflow specialists, was dissolved, with the general Autodesk support team attempting to fill in. From the perspective of the product team, we pretty much stopped hearing from customers altogether (aside from those we were speaking to directly).\n The incubation process ended, or perhaps fizzled out. Many customers were complaining that their needs were not being met, but there wasn\u2019t capacity to do anything about it (others had since given up complaining, which was in many ways worse). What we were trying to focus our energies on at that point was creating the infrastructure to create new experiences in a piecemeal way that would be decoupled from the problematic technology stack. Our bet was that being able to build in a new environment would allow for experimentation and iteration at a speed expected of a modern software company. It represented our attempt to finally break free of the technical debt that had plagued us for years. It was exciting.\n  I can\u2019t say (both for legal reasons, and because I don\u2019t know) where things are headed for Shotgun going forwards. It has recently been renamed to \u201cShotGrid\u201d in an effort to make it less problematic, as part of the integration work (and needless to say, requiring a lot of work in its own right). I can count the number of people still working on the ShotGrid team who have industry experience on one hand (and the former willingness to learn and empathise seems to have dissipated), a far cry from how it was when I joined. Perhaps that doesn\u2019t matter. Perhaps the remaining ShotGrid team will be able to address the product debt issues and modernise or otherwise improve it for the userbase in a way we were unable to do. More than anything, I hope to read a post from a customer at some point in the future, telling a story about how the product helped them get home in time for dinner.", "posttime": "2021-06-21

", "note_en": "I&#39;m switching to Julia after running this comparison of Julia vs Numpy and Fortran, for performance and code simplicity.\n      Julia is a pretty new language, which, among other things, aims tosolve the so-called  \u201ctwo-language problem\u201d in scientific computing.\n That is, we usually test ideas in a  rapid-prototyping languagelike Matlab or Python, but when the testing is done, and its timeto do some serious computation, we need to rely on a different (compiled)programming language.\n Many tools exist to ease the transition, and  wrapping Fortran librariesinto Python has been my preference so far. For example, wrapping up some Fortran with F2PY seems like a very convenient wayto use (and distribute) efficient Fortran code that anybody can run.I also keep track of various ways of using Fortran in Python in  this post.\n Now,  Julia aims to solve this issue in a radical way. The idea is to usea single programming language, which has both an interactive mode, suitablefor rapid prototyping, but that can also be compiled and executed at C/Fortranperformance.\n     Numpy is restricted to single-threading in many cases, is hard to code and read, and can be much slower than the two alternatives.\n Fortran offers great performance with pretty simple code, but some wrapping is required to call Fortran from high-level languages like Python.\n Julia is faster and easier to write than Numpy and is even able to beat gfortran\u2019s performance.\n Honestly, I was shocked by what I found in my performance comparison.Julia is amazing.  I didn\u2019t expect Julia would beat gfortran with compiler optimizations in my test.And it currently does so  by a lofty margin.\n  Opinions on code readability are, of course, subjective, but I want to explainwhy I think  Numpy offers the worst quality experience.\n So far, interpreted languages have required manual re-writing of loops as vector operations.With some practice, this becomes and easy task, but after having done so extensively for many years (first in Matlab, then in Python),I came to the conclusion that  I hate to manually vectorize code. I prefer to write for loops and have the compiler vectorize them for me!\n   Can you tell what it does, at first sight? Can you reason about the code\u2019s performance?Can you even guess the dimension of the output M?\n Now, here is a nested for loop which does the same as the above code.\n    No wonder why they named Fortran \u201cFORmula TRANslator\u201d in the first place.Interestingly, the Julia syntax is exactly similar in this regard.\n So even though I agree with the idea than Python is a beautiful language to work with,I don\u2019t think the same holds for Numpy. Yes, Numpy allows us to stay within a Python framework and get things donewith simple one-liners (which is pretty neat anyway) but the resulting Numpycode becomes hard to read afterward.\n  I believe there is no such thing as a definitive benchmark. Running a seriesof completely unrelated tests of toy problems, and claiming that a certain languageis overall the best because it does well in most of the tests,is meaningless if we are interested in certain specific and more realisticcases.\n Rather than trying to rely on big, all-purpose benchmarks, I believe it is preferable to run,from time to time, some micro-benchmarks suited to our own projects.\n If we can predict what the major performance bottlenecks of our code will be,major performance bottleneck of our codeWe can then come up with a minimalistic, but spot-on example, and create a specific performancetest that suits our needs.\n In my numerical projects, for example, I do a lot of array operations and I evaluate a lot of complex exponentials.So that\u2019s why this test is about just that. My benchmark was already described above,it\u2019s just: given a vector a, form the matrix\n   All tests were run in an Intel i7-4700MQ CPU (3.40 GHz, 6MB of Cache)with 8 GB of DDR3 RAM\n   function eval_exp(N) a = range(0, stop=2*pi, length=N) A = Matrix{ComplexF64}(undef, N, N) @inbounds  [email\u00a0protected] for j in 1:N for i in 1:N A[i,j] = exp((100+im)*im*sqrt(a[i]^2 + a[j]^2)) end end return Aendeval_exp(5)print(string(&#34;running loop on &#34;, Threads.nthreads(), &#34; threads \\n&#34;))for N in 1000:1000:10000 @time begin A = eval_exp(N) endend\n   note: ST and MT stand for single-threaded and multithreaded,respectively. Note that in all cases, the fast-math optimization flag was used, which allows compilers to reorder mathematical expressions to obtain accuracy, but in a way that could break IEEE compliance.\n  Interestingly, from the above table, we can compute the threading efficiency,that is, the speed-up factor when moving from single to multithreading.\n  In a quad-core CPU, Julia\u2019s Multithreading efficiency is about 4.9,whereas when relying on gfortran and OpenMP, we get about 3.6. So Julia is effectively taking advantage of hyperthreading, somethingwhich is rarely seen in OpenMP.\n    It turns out that Julia has further tools to increase performance. One of such toolsis LoopVectorization.jl\n As suggested by Mason in  this topicof the JuliaLang forum, at least the single-threaded version can besped up quite significantly by resorting to that library.\n I\u2019ll continue to dig deeper on how to skeeze the last bit of performanceout of computer hardware by resorting to Julia. Stay tuned!\n  Why is Fortran still used. I had a fair degree of experience with Fortran, and I believe there are solid reasons to use Fortran for scientific computing today.\n Will Julia Replace Fortran in HPC?. However, afeter comparing Fortran with Julia on various grounds, I tend to think that, over time, Julia seems on track to superseed Fortran, even in the HPC niche.\n I&#39;m Martin D.
