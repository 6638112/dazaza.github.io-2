The site \u2013 named McGraths Flat \u2013 contains superb examples of fossilised animals and plants from the Miocene epoch. The team\u2019s findings were published today in   Science Advances.\n The new fossil site is located in the Central Tablelands, NSW near the town of Gulgong, and represents one of only a handful of fossil sites in Australia that can be classified as a \u2018 Lagerst\u00e4tte\u2019\u2013 a site that contains fossils of exceptional quality.\n Over the last three years a team of researchers has been secretly excavating the site, discovering thousands of specimens including rainforest plants, insects, spiders, fish and a bird feather.\n  UNSW Senior Lecturer Dr McCurry said the fossils formed between 11 and 16 million years ago and are important for understanding the history of the Australian continent.\n \u201cThe fossils we have found prove that the area was once a temperate, mesic rainforest and that life was rich and abundant here in the Central Tablelands,\u201d Dr McCurry said.\n \u201cMany of the fossils that we are finding are new to science and include trapdoor spiders, giant cicadas, wasps and a variety of fish.\n \u201cUntil now it has been difficult to tell what these ancient ecosystems were like, but the level of preservation at this new fossil site means that even small fragile organisms like insects turned into well-preserved fossils.\u201d\n Associate Professor Michael Frese, who imaged the fossils using stacking microphotography and a scanning electron microscope (SEM), said that the fossils from McGraths Flat show an incredibly detailed preservation.\n \u201cUsing electron microscopy, I can image individual cells of plants and animals and sometimes even very small subcellular structures,\u201d Dr Frese said.\n \u201cThe fossils also preserve evidence of interactions between species. For instance, we have fish stomach contents preserved in the fish, meaning that we can figure out what they were eating. We have also found examples of pollen preserved on the bodies of insects so we can tell which species were pollinating which plants.\n \u201cThe discovery of melanosomes \u2013 subcellular organelles that store the melanin pigment \u2013 allows us to reconstruct the colour pattern of birds and fishes that once lived at McGraths Flat. Interestingly, the colour itself is not preserved, but by comparing the size, shape and stacking pattern of the melanosomes in our fossils with melanosomes in extant specimens, we can often reconstruct colour and/or colour patterns.\u201d\n  The fossils were found within an iron-rich rock called \u2018goethite\u2019, not usually thought of as a source of exceptional fossils. \u201cWe think that the process that turned these organisms into fossils is key to why they are so well preserved. Our analyses suggest that the fossils formed when iron-rich groundwaters drained into a billabong, and that a precipitation of iron minerals encased organisms that were living in or fell into the water,\u201d Dr McCurry said.\n Dr McCurry said the fossilised plants and animals were similar to those found in rainforests of northern Australia, but that there were signs that the ecosystem at McGraths Flat was beginning to dry.\n \u201cThe pollen we found in the sediment suggests that there might have been drier habitats surrounding the wetter rainforest, indicating a change to drier conditions,\u201d he said.\n Australian Museum Chief Scientist and director of the AM\u2019s Research Institute, Professor Kristofer Helgen, said the fossil site brought to life a picture of outback Australia that we can now barely believe existed.\n \u201cAustralia is the most unique continent biologically, and this site is extremely valuable in what it tells us about the evolutionary history of this part of the world. It provides further evidence of changing climates and helps fill the gaps in our knowledge of that time and region,\u201d Prof. Helgen said.\n \u201cThe AM has a rich history of expeditions and scientific research, and we love that the public is always fascinated by these fundamental human endeavours of exploration and discovery.\u201d\n Field work at McGraths Flat was funded through the generous donation from a descendant of Robert Etheridge, an English palaeontologist who came to Australia in 1866. Etheridge joined the Australian Museum in 1887 as Assistant Palaeontologist and in 1895 was made Curator of the Museum.\n   First found in 2017, McGraths Flat is named after Nigel McGrath who discovered the first fossils from the site. The site is located near Gulgong in central NSW (Gulgong is a Wiradjuri word that means \u201cdeep waterhole\u201d).\n The Miocene Epoch (~23\u20135 million years ago) was a time of immense change in Australia. The Australian continent had separated from Antarctica and South America and was drifting northwards. When the Miocene began there was enormous richness and variety of plant and animal life in Australia. But at around 14 million years ago an abrupt change in climate known as the \u201cMiddle Miocene Disruption\u201d caused widespread extinctions. Throughout the latter half of the Miocene, Australia gradually became more and more arid, and rainforests turned into the dry shrublands and deserts that now characterise the landscape. The newly discovered fossil site, McGraths Flat, provides an unprecedented look into what Australian ecosystems were like prior to this aridification.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:34:06",

"note_en": "Study finds test works on people with concerning signs such as unexplained weight loss or fatigue\n    Scientists have developed a blood test that could help detect cancer in people with nonspecific symptoms such as unexplained weight loss or fatigue.\n If validated, the test could enable cancer patients to be identified earlier, when they are more likely to respond to treatment, and help flag up who could benefit from early access to drugs designed to tackle metastatic cancer. The test can also tell if the disease has spread.\n  There is currently no clear route through which someone with nonspecific symptoms that could be cancer is referred for further investigation. NHS rapid diagnostic centres are being set up to support faster and earlier cancer diagnosis, but often patients will be examined by their GP, and if they can\u2019t identify an obvious cause of their symptoms then the patient will simply be told to come back if they get worse.\n \u201cThe problem we\u2019ve had in the past is that if they do have cancer, that cancer is growing all the time, and when they come back the cancers are often quite advanced,\u201d said Dr James Larkin, of the University of Oxford, who was involved in the research.\n Although it is difficult to know precisely how many individuals fall into this category, \u201cit is likely to be tens of thousands of patients across the UK,\u201d Larkin said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to capture these patients when they come to the GP, to give them an immediate referral option.\n \u201cThe moment you can say \u2018you have a cancer\u2019, it provides a strong incentive to send that patient for an imaging investigation to see if you can find that cancer.\u201d\n The new test utilises a technology called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which profiles levels of small molecules called metabolites in the blood. Healthy individuals have different metabolic \u201cfingerprints\u201d to those with localised or metastatic cancer.\n In a study published in the journal  Clinical Cancer Research, Larkin and colleagues analysed samples from 300 patients with nonspecific but concerning symptoms of cancer, such as fatigue and weight loss, and found that the test correctly detected cancer in 19 out of every 20 of those with the disease. It cannot yet pinpoint the type of tumour they have, but this is the ultimate goal.\n The test could also distinguish between patients with localised or metastatic cancer with 94% accuracy, making this the first blood test to be able to detect if a person\u2019s cancer has spread without knowing type of tumour they have.\n \u201cSuch information changes how you treat patients,\u201d Larkin said. For instance, certain immunotherapies have been shown to increase survival rates among people with metastatic cancer, but they are expensive and have side-effects. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to prescribe them to everyone, but there are patients out there that would absolutely benefit if you could only identify them early enough.\n A different type of  blood test that aims to detect circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) is being trialled in the NHS, but metabolic changes may be detectable earlier, while ctDNA technology also requires you to know which mutations to look for when finding a tumour.\n The next step is to confirm the accuracy of the test in 2,000 to 3000 British patients with nonspecific symptoms, which Larkin hopes could happen within the next two years. This data would then be submitted to national regulatory agencies responsible for authorising such tests.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:33:25", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8bd5\u9a8c,test,\u5177\u6709", "title": "\u8840\u6db2\u8bd5\u9a8c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u60a3\u6709\u975e\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u75c7\u72b6\u7684\u4eba\u7684\u764c\u75c7", "title_en": "Blood Test Could Help Detect Cancer Earlier In People With Nonspecific Symptoms", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/05/blood-test-could-help-detect-cancer-in-people-with-nonspecific-symptoms", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8bd5\u9a8c", "test", "\u5177\u6709"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "08e0dad70c80a043549e73e7533f3bc3.jpg", "infoid": 1072503, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u968f\u7740\u66b4\u98ce\u96ea\u672c\u5468\u626b\u8fc7\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e1c\u6d77\u5cb8\uff0c\u4ea4\u901a\u5b98\u5458\u90e8\u7f72\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4fdd\u6301\u51ac\u5b63\u9053\u8def\u6e05\u6670\uff1a\u76d0\u3002\n\u9053\u8def\u76d0\u7531\u6c2f\u5316\u94a0\u5236\u6210\uff0c\u8868\u76d0\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u540c\u5316\u5b66\u54c1\u3002\u6839\u636e\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u6240\u6709\u76d0\uff0c\u5927\u7ea643\uff05\u7528\u4e8e2020\u5e74\u5730\u8d28\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u516c\u8def\u53bb\u51b0\u3002\n\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u4e5f\u6709\u540e\u679c\u3002 Hintz\u535a\u58eb\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6de1\u6c34\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u76d0\u5ea6\u6c34\u5e73\u5347\u9ad8\u5df2\u7ecf\u5bfc\u81f4\u6de1\u6c34\u751f\u7269\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u548c\u751f\u957f\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u7e41\u6b96\u4ea7\u51fa\u7684\u51cf\u5c11\u3002\n\u636eCary Institute\u79f0\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d89\u53ca\u7528\u76d0\u76d0\u6c34\u6eb6\u6db2\u8fdb\u884c\u98ce\u66b4\u5904\u7406\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u76d0\u91cf\u51cf\u5c1175\uff05\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9053\u8def\u7b49\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u76d0\u50a8\u5b58\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u9650\u5ea6\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002", "note_en": "As snowstorms sweep the East Coast of the United States this week, transportation officials have deployed a go-to solution for keeping winter roads clear: salt.\n But while pouring tons of salt on roads makes winter driving safer, it also has damaging environmental and health consequences, according to a growing body of research.\n As snow and ice melt on roads, the salt washes into soil, lakes and streams, in some cases contaminating drinking water reservoirs and wells. It has killed or endangered wildlife in freshwater ecosystems, with high chloride levels toxic to fish, bugs and amphibians, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  \u201cIt\u2019s an issue that requires attention now,\u201d said Bill Hintz, an assistant professor in the environmental sciences department at the University of Toledo and the lead author of a recent research review published in the journal  Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment.\n  \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of scientific evidence to suggest that freshwater ecosystems are being contaminated by salt from the use of things like road salt beyond the concentration which is safe for freshwater organisms and for human consumption,\u201d Dr. Hintz said.\n  Salt has been used to de-ice roads in the United States since the 1930s, and its use across the country has tripled in the past 50 years, Dr. Hintz said. More than 20 million metric tons of salt are poured on U.S. roads each winter, according to an estimate by the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in New York, and the environmental costs are growing.\n  Still, little has been done to address the environmental impact of road salt because it is cheap and effective, said Victoria Kelly, the environmental programming manager at the Cary Institute. By lowering the freezing temperature of water, salt prevents snow from turning to ice and melts ice that is already there.\n Road salt is made from sodium chloride, the same chemical found in table salt. Of all salt consumed in the United States, about 43 percent is used for highway de-icing, according to the U.S. Geological Survey in 2020.\n  The consequences of insufficiently salting roads were seen this week, when hundreds of drivers were stranded by  a snowstorm on Interstate 95 in Virginia. Officials said the storm began with rain, which washed away road salt and made it difficult to keep roads clear.  More snow fell in the Mid-Atlantic States and the Northeast on Friday.\n But environmentalists say the problems associated with road salt are getting harder to ignore. Ms. Kelly said the accumulation of salt in drinking water reservoirs in some places was harming people on low-sodium diets.\n  A 2018 study of wells in Dutchess County, N.Y., found that sodium concentration in wells reached levels as high as 860 milligrams per liter \u2014 much higher than the  federal and state recommendation that levels not exceed 20 milligrams per liter for people on very low-sodium diets and 270 milligrams per liter for people on moderately restricted sodium diets.\n A separate 2018 study in the journal Environmental Science and Technology showed that 24 percent of private drinking wells in New York were contaminated with salt that had been used on roads. About 15 percent of people in the United States get their water from private ground wells, while the rest rely on community water systems, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n More counties and states are rethinking the amount of salt they use because of the associated costs. Last month, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York announced appointments to the Adirondack Road Salt Reduction Task Force, established to review road-salt contamination.\n \u201cI have no doubt that this group of individuals will work tirelessly to protect our state from the adverse effects of road salt,\u201d Ms. Hochul said. \u201cWe look forward to seeing this group finally convene and make progress in preventing further pollution to our waterways and our environment.\u201d\n  There are consequences for wildlife, too. Dr. Hintz said his review showed that elevated salinity levels in freshwater ecosystems had already caused a reduction in the abundance and growth of freshwater organisms and a reduction in their reproduction outputs.\n Card 1 of 3 Biden\u2019s climate agenda in peril.  President Biden is facing an  increasingly narrow path\u00a0to fulfill his ambitious environmental goals with the\u00a0Build Back Better Act \u2014 which contains $555 billion in proposed climate action \u2014  in limbo on Capitol Hill.\n How some cities are reducing emissions.  A district in London has developed an innovative way to  divert subway heat for buildings to lower carbon emissions. Stockholm and Vancouver are turning to waste heat from sewage instead.\n Sounding the alarm.  A report on the state of the Arctic  highlights troubling and consistent trends\u00a0in the region that are linked to global warming. Researchers are  also growing increasingly concerned about Antarctica, where ice shelves are melting and wilder winds are altering crucial currents.\n Road salt also corrodes vehicles and bridges, causing $5 billion in annual repairs in the United States, according to an estimate by the Environmental Protection Agency. AAA suggests drivers wash and clean their vehicles regularly during winter to help offset the effects of road salt and to limit driving when salt and other de-icing chemicals are at their highest concentrations.\n In Britain, the Salt Association said that salt was the cheapest form of de-icing material and that it had a low environmental impact when used responsibly. \u201cAs with all highway maintenance activities, there are environmental implications from winter road maintenance,\u201d the organization said in a statement. \u201cHighways depots, spreading vehicles and the de-icing agent all contribute, but with good management, this burden can be minimized.\u201d\n  While there is not a perfect solution to the issue, there are alternatives that can significantly reduce salt usage without compromising driver safety.\n One method involves treating roads before storms with a salt brine solution, which can lead to a 75 percent reduction in the amount of salt used while keeping roads just as safe, according to the Cary Institute. Building better salt storage sites can also minimize waste.\n Some counties, like Jefferson County, Wis., have already made changes. Bill Kern, the county\u2019s highway commissioner, said switching to a brine solution had enabled the county to cut its salt use by up to 60 percent since 2018 without an increase in the number of accidents. By using less salt, the county has reduced its overall cost for winter maintenance of state and county highways by 20 percent since 2018, saving about $1.6 million, Mr. Kern said.\n Over the past decade, some states, including Rhode Island, have passed legislation aimed to reduce their use of road salt and have increasingly applied a brine solution to roads in winter, but environmentalists say more needs to be done.\n  While engineers have developed better alternatives, they have not been widely implemented in part because they require upfront costs for purchasing equipment, Ms. Kelly said.\n \u201cIt\u2019ll save us money, and it\u2019ll help to save our freshwater,\u201d she said, while adding that \u201cbecause of that legacy effect, it\u2019s going to take a really long time to see the impact of the steps we take.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:32:20", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u9053\u8def,salt", "title": "\u9053\u8def\u76d0\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u4f46\u5b83\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u4e5f\u5f88\u7cdf\u7cd5\u3002", "title_en": "Road Salt Works.

He knows logic, strategy and decision-making. Widely regarded as the greatest chess player in the history of mankind, the Russian grandmaster \u2013 ranked No. 1 from 1984 to 2005 \u2013 sees the world with a certain clarity.\n So it will delight many in the blockchain industry to learn that Kasparov, easily one of the smartest people alive, is now a champion of cryptocurrency. And it\u2019s partly because of math. Kasparov has spent his \u201cretirement\u201d opposing Russian President Vladimir Putin (a defiance that once got him tossed in jail), fighting for humanitarian causes and serving as chairman of the Human Rights Foundation (a nonprofit that strongly supports  bitcoin as a freedom-giving tool). Now he views crypto as a way to check government power. Bitcoin offers protection against rampant government spending, says Kasparov, \u201cbecause you\u2019re protected by math\u201d \u2013 by the logic of the code itself.\n  Kasparov also sees merit in  non-fungible tokens. In December, in partnership with  1Kind, he dropped a series of 32 NFTs that showcase iconic moments from his life: the 1985 match that crowned him as the youngest world chess champion, the epic battle against International Business Machines\u2019 artificial intelligence-powered \u201cDeep Blue\u201d and speeches against totalitarian governments.\n It\u2019s this battle against totalitarianism that has defined the current chapter of his life, and Kasparov sees crypto as part of that struggle. Or as the grandmaster puts it, \u201cI believe that supporting crypto is an important part of my contribution to the future of humanity.\u201d\n   Kasparov: If you followed my career and read about my early interest in computers and technology, you should not be surprised that I was very excited when I recognized the value of cryptocurrencies and NFTs.\n This goes all the way back to the \u201880s; I always tried to be at the cutting edge. It started with chess. But I also saw an opportunity to use computers and new tools to advance individual freedoms. It\u2019s my belief that technology should help people fight back against the power of the state.\n  Cryptocurrencies become an inseparable part of or progress, because the whole world is moving digital. And if the economy becomes more digital, so does the money. Another philosophical reason is that \u2026 governments [have] unlimited opportunities to print money. And printing money is the most exquisite form of borrowing from us and from future generations.\n And I believe that cryptocurrencies \u2013 with bitcoin as a standard \u2013 offer a protection against this onslaught of the government, because you\u2019re protected by math. You\u2019re protected by the limited number of any code behind the respective currency. Cryptocurrencies, and all the products related to cryptocurrencies, are absolutely vital for the future development of our world.\n   My first indirect involvement was through the Human Rights Foundation. Because in the Human Rights Foundation, we had a few experts that have been advocating cryptocurrencies at a very early stage. And as an organization, we offer support to the dissidents around the world.\n We thought about using crypto as a way to help them to get material help, because in many countries it was impossible \u2013 and it\u2019s still impossible \u2013 to actually get proper funding. So crypto offered an opportunity to support these activists indirectly. And the more I learned about it, the more interested I got in the whole mechanism.\n  Look, crypto is a controversial thing. Because you hear a lot of people say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s money laundering. That helps bad guys.\u201d True. I mean, no technology is uniquely good, because it\u2019s technology. Humans still have a monopoly for evil.\n So, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of talks about it, and I\u2019ll say, \u201cLook, it\u2019s not the magic wand or the terminator. It\u2019s not a harbinger of utopia or dystopia. It\u2019s a tool.\u201d Crypto is a tool. And of course it could benefit some bad guys with maligned intentions. But it\u2019s about the balance, it\u2019s about trade-offs. And I think the balance is so much in favor of progress.\n  You mentioned crypto\u2019s ability to help protect human rights in undemocratic countries. What do you see as the benefits in democratic countries?\n In the democratic countries in America and Europe, trillions of dollars will be printed. I\u2019m an American taxpayer. And I understand that you need to build new infrastructure. But I\u2019m not happy to see that the government has a free hand to use my taxes, basically to devalue [the dollar].\n So I think it\u2019s very important that technology would offer me an opportunity to fight back, to protect my hard-earned fortune. And I think that bitcoin \u2013 which I believe is online gold \u2013 and other cryptocurrencies are the way to the future. I\u2019m not a financial expert, but I would not be surprised if, I would not be surprised if, in 10 years\u2019 time, the dollar will be replaced by the basket of coins as a standard.\n   I suppose if you believe that, then it would almost be foolish not to be buying Bitcoin?\n   Well, I think bitcoin will remain as a standard. But of course it cannot stay alone. So that\u2019s why you have more coins coming in. It\u2019s a natural process. Now we have thousands and thousands of coins. It\u2019s like the dot-com bubble. Ninety-nine point nine percent will be gone. But those that survive will become the Googles of the world. I\u2019m not here to judge which one, but there will be few that will survive \u2013 that\u2019s why I said basket of coins.\n In the past, your championing of human rights has gotten you in trouble with the Russian authorities. Given that background, are you concerned that your support for cryptocurrency can get you in hot water?\n Well, this is definitely a no. [In the past,] I was in hot water. To give you an idea, one of the NFTs is a picture of my first arrest in Russia. So it\u2019s all reflected in my NFT. Look, this is much less perilous than to attack Putin directly.\n I grew up in the Soviet Union, and learned from my mother and my teacher the motto of Soviet dissidents, \u201cDo what you must, and so be it.\u201d And I believe that supporting crypto is an important part of my contribution to the future of humanity. And, again, I [view it] as a much less risky endeavor than speaking publicly about Putin or other dictators.\n   I don\u2019t pretend to be a great expert in NFTs, but I\u2019m not aware of anything similar that exists. It\u2019s a collection of 30-plus NFTs that are related to special events in my life and special people in my life. This is a story that connects you to very personal moments. Every NFT has a video message.\n It\u2019s all connected to the physical assets, like my notebooks from the \u201870s. Thanks to my late mother, who preserved this archive, you can actually look at me scribbling in 1973.\n The NFTs all reflect the moments of me growing up, learning from my mother, and from my teachers, and then fighting for the title, and then shifting my life and moving into human rights and computers.\n Interesting. This feels almost like a memoir, in a sense. I\u2019ve worked with CEOs before to collaborate on their memoirs, and one thing I\u2019ve found is that the process can almost be emotional, or even a bit therapeutic. Did you have any sense of that?\n The whole story starts from a very emotional moment, though it\u2019s a tragic one. My mother died on Christmas day last year, from COVID. And I couldn\u2019t be next to her, and that was a really big blow because we were so close.\n While she was alive, I didn\u2019t even know that she preserved all these archives. She was not happy to talk about the past. That\u2019s why I [held off] on any major publication that would highlight [the past]. I wrote two books, but not the one that could tell everything.\n After she died, I thought it would be right for me [to honor] her memory to actually start doing things. I\u2019m doing a documentary now; it\u2019s in Russian. The first segment will be ready early next year. And I hope I can cover my entire chess career, and it\u2019s for her. It\u2019s dedicated for her. And this [NFT] project was inspired by this tragedy. I thought it was very important to show my personal life and her connection, and why she was so important.\n And so I spoke to 1Kind, and 10% of the sales will go to Kasparov Chess Foundation, and this will be a scholarship under her name for all the great talents raised by single mothers.\n  The leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a  strict set of editorial policies.

The protests began in the west of the country over the weekend, after a sharp rise in fuel prices, and quickly spread through cities across the nation.\n The internet was shut down nationwide on Wednesday. And though the intent appeared to be to disrupt the protesters\u2019 communications, the effects of the blackout have spread further.\n Kazakhstan is a power player in the bitcoin world. Last year, the nation became the world\u2019s second-largest center for bitcoin mining after the United States, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, after China, a major hub, clamped down on crypto mining activity. As of August, Kazakhstan was hosting 18% of global bitcoin mining, according to  Fortune.\n  Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are created or \u201cmined\u201d by high-powered computers, usually at data centers in different parts of the world that compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles in a highly energy-intensive process.\n The more miners on the network, the greater the amount of computer power is needed to mine new bitcoin. The hashrate falls if miners drop off the network, in theory making it easier for the remaining miners to produce new coin.\n The hashrate at major crypto mining pools \u2013 groups of miners in different locations that team up to produce bitcoin \u2013 was down 14% from Tuesday to Thursday, according to data from mining firm BTC.com.\n Bitcoin\u2019s price, too, took a plunge \u2013 a drop in hashrate doesn\u2019t necessarily boost price. The cryptocurrency fell below $43,000 on Thursday, testing multi-month lows.\n  Economics aside, bitcoin\u2019s negative  environmental impact has been an ongoing issue. Blockchain-based currencies require large amounts of power, which is mostly derived from fossil fuels. And in Kazakhstan, specifically, the power behind bitcoin is cause for concern.\n Coal is the main source of regional power. Kazakhstan\u2019s crypto mining farms are mostly powered by ageing coal plants which themselves \u2013 along with coalmines and whole towns built around them \u2013 are a headache for authorities as they seek to decarbonize the economy. Since the old plants are inefficient and carbon-heavy, they generate an outsize amount of pollution.\n According to the  International Energy Agency, Kazakhstan\u2019s emissions per energy unit are higher than what China\u2019s used to be. The agency estimates that China\u2019s coal emitted about 1,000g of CO 2 a kilowatt hour, while Kazakhstan\u2019s emits close to 1,500g.\n The Kazakh government said last year it planned to crack down first on unregistered \u201cgrey\u201d miners who it estimates might be consuming twice as much power as the \u201cwhite\u201d or officially registered ones.\n Last year, its energy ministry said that \u201cgrey\u201d mining may consume up to 1.2GW of power, which together with \u201cwhite\u201d miners\u2019 600MW comes up to about 8% of Kazakhstan\u2019s total generation capacity.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:28:40", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01,\u4f18\u60e0,internet,\u6316\u6398", "title": "\u54c8\u8428\u514b\u65af\u5766\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u5173\u95ed\u4f18\u60e0\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u91c7\u77ff\u4e1a\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u6253\u51fb", "title_en": "Kazakhstan Internet Shutdown Deals Blow To Global Bitcoin Mining Operation", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/kazakhstan-bitcoin-internet-shutdown", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01", "\u4f18\u60e0", "internet", "\u6316\u6398"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d1df198affec6555963c51dcc78b00a1.jpg", "infoid": 1072499, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u5468\u56db\u76d1\u7763Firefox\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5468\u56db\u627f\u8ba4\u4e86\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u6f5c\u5728\u5730\u6784\u6210\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u793a\u6b63\u5728\u5ba1\u67e5\u5176\u76ee\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u52a0\u5bc6\u6350\u8d60\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u201c\u9002\u5408\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6c14\u5019\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u201d\n\u56f4\u7ed5\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u73af\u5883\u8db3\u8ff9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5df2\u4e0e\u5404\u79cd\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u521b\u5efa\u65b9\u5f0f\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002 Bitcoin\u548cEthereum\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u5de5\u4f5c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u8584\u8377\u7684\u6bcf\u79cd\u8d27\u5e01\u7684\u65b0\u5757\u4f9b\u7535\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u8ba1\u7b97\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u7f51\u7edc\u589e\u957f\u5e76\u751f\u4e0b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u56f4\u7ed5\u65f6\u949f\u56f4\u7ed5\u7740\u6570\u5343\u4e2aGPU\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u751f\u80b2\uff0c\u4ee5\u53c2\u4e0e\u89e3\u51b3\u96be\u9898\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u3002", "note_en": "The foundation, which oversees the development of the Firefox browser, on Thursday acknowledged conversations around the environmental impact that cryptocurrencies potentially pose and said it is reviewing whether its current policy on crypto donations \u201c fits with our climate goals.\u201d\n \u201cDecentralized web technology continues to be an important area for us to explore, but a lot has changed since we started accepting crypto donations,\u201d the foundation said in a tweet thread, pledging to be forthcoming about the updates of its review.\n  The foundation started to face backlash after it invited people to donate to the American nonprofit firm via using a variety of crypto tokens, including bitcoin.\n In response to its tweet, Jamie Zawinski (a founder of Mozilla)\u00a0 expressed dismay at the foundation\u2019s move. \u201cEveryone involved in the project should be witheringly ashamed of this decision to partner with planet-incinerating Ponzi grifters,\u201d he said, adding an expletive.\n Peter Linss, the founder of Gecko, the engine that powered the browser,  joined the conversation in telling Mozilla that it was \u201cmeant to be better than this.\u201d\n This isn\u2019t the first time a major firm has faced backlash \u2014 or distanced itself from Bitcoin \u2014 because of environmental concerns. In May last year, Tesla suspended accepting bitcoin as payment for its vehicles, just  months after introducing the option.\n  Musk said the firm was \u201cconcerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal.\u201d Weeks later, he said the company will \u201cmost likely\u201d  accept bitcoin again once the mining rate for the cryptocurrency reaches 50% renewables.\n Questions around the environmental footprint of Bitcoin have been linked to how various tokens are created. Bitcoin and Ethereum use a mechanism called proof-of-work to power their networks and mint new blocks of each currency. This calculation, by design, has become more complex over the years as the networks grew and gave birth to an industry of firms that run thousands of GPUs around the clock to participate in solving the puzzle.\n Bitcoin mining consumes about 148 terawatt-hours of energy annually, the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance estimates. Many cryptocurrency proponents have, however, either\u00a0 disputed such findings or have made a case for why it is worth it.\n In recent months, a broader divide has started to emerge in the industry. The critics have challenged some of the fundamental value proposition of web3. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, who supports Bitcoin, has  dismissed the assertion that VCs aren\u2019t reaping most profits from web3 projects.\n Amid the ongoing discourse, many firms have\u00a0scaled back their web3 ambitions. Discord  pushed pause on exploring crypto and NFTs in November following outcry from many who opposed the idea.

We are grateful to our Limited Partners who have believed in us and stuck with us over the past 12 years and hope to earn their trust once again. We thank our many wonderful entrepreneurs who made this set of funds possible.\n One might ask: \u201cWhy invest $9B in a brand new set of technology companies?\u201d Our answer begins with one of the firm\u2019s core   cultural values :   We believe in the future and we bet the firm that way.\n At Andreessen Horowitz, we specifically believe in the technology-enabled future. There are no more worthwhile endeavors than our most brilliant minds taking great risks to improve the world by doing something larger than themselves. As my partner Marc describes in   Technology Saves the World , without great advances in technology, life on Earth certainly will not get better and may well get worse.\n Beyond that, we see entrepreneurs every day with potential solutions ranging from a fairer creative economy to better education for low income students to cures for cancer. We never know which of these will work and that\u2019s why we value the people who bet their careers and their lives on solving these problems.\n It is our role and mission to help these entrepreneurs build the best companies they can and achieve their important goals. With these new funds, including a $1.5B Bio fund, $5B Growth fund, and $2.5B Venture fund, coupled with the $2.2B Crypto Fund and $400M Seed Fund we raised in 2021, we will continue to invest across the entire spectrum of stages, writing checks as small as $25,000 and up to hundreds of millions of dollars.\n    The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

Put more simply, Ottawa-based Assent aims to help manufacturers make smarter decisions regarding \u201cwho they do business with and how their products are sourced,\u201d notes CEO Andrew Waitman.\n And today, the company is announcing it has raised $350 million at a valuation of more than $1 billion in a funding round led by Vista Equity Partners. The financing follows a $131 million Series C raise led by Warburg Pincus, which remains the company\u2019s largest shareholder.\n  Interestingly, Assent was bootstrapped for the first five years of its life \u2014 from 2010 to 2015. In the subsequent years, after Waitman came on as CEO, the company has raised over $500 million and grew its headcount from about 20 to 820 today (45% of which identify as female). While half a billion dollars raised in the U.S. is not uncommon, it\u2019s a bit more rare in the Canadian tech scene.\n Assent\u2019s trajectory continues to grow and Waitman projects the SaaS company will cross $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) this year after growing ARR by over 50% in the past 12 months. Its customers include the likes of  GE Appliances, Polaris, Stryker and Escatec.\n The company delivers enterprise-wide supply chain sustainability solutions across product compliance, trade compliance and ESG \u2014 better known as  Environmental, Social and (Corporate) Governance . Assent has made a name for itself by being exclusively focused on complex manufacturing. Doubling down on that niche has allowed it to build what it claims is \u201cthe industry\u2019s largest network of supplier intelligence.\u201d Specifically, it works to help complex manufacturers proactively identify and manage risk, accelerate market access and growth and promote brand reputation.\n Assent\u2019s compliance platform provides centralized access to supply chain data for use by teams across a given company. It automates data collection and validation and provides \u201cconfigurable\u201d reporting so that its customers \u201ccan stay ahead\u201d of their data requirements.\n  \u201cThe increasing complexity and scale of regulations and varying requirements globally, combined with a heightened focus on ESG, presents challenges for companies across industries, particularly for manufacturers,\u201d Waitman said. \u201cAssent enables deep insight and rapid transparency to help ensure products are made with environmental and human rights standards necessary to compete \u2014 and win \u2014 in markets of the future.\u201d\n  The company plans to use its new capital mostly to continue expanding in Europe, eventually enter the Asian market and grow its headcount by 40% across its sales, services, engineering, customer success and marketing teams.\n \u201cManufacturing represents 20% of GDP,\u201d Waitman told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s an enormous market.\u201d\n Vista\u2019s Foundation Fund, which invests in middle-market companies seeking to scale and accelerate their growth trajectory, led the investment. Vista\u2019s Patrick Severson, co-head of the Vista Foundation Fund, and Jake Hodgman, managing director of the Foundation Fund, will join the Assent board of directors.\n Companies globally are facing increased demand to ensure they source their components and raw materials in an ethical and responsible manner, either from government regulators who oversee them or from customers and partners whose expectations hold them to higher standards, noted Severson. Assent is \u201cahead of the curve\u201d when it comes to solving enterprise supply chain challenges through technology.\n \u201c Assent\u2019s solution empowers companies to mitigate their brand and reputation risk and become better corporate citizens,\u201d  Severson added. \u201cThe scrutiny being placed on complex manufacturers in how they manage their supply chains is only increasing. Assent is uniquely positioned to be a clear leader in a future focused on manufacturers adopting supply chain sustainability best practices.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:25:04", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "compliance", "title": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e25\u592a\u534e\u7684\u7b26\u5408\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u5e2e\u52a9\u516c\u53f8\u5408\u89c4\u6027\uff0c\u8d38\u6613\u5408\u89c4\u548cESG\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u7684SaaS\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\uff0c\u4ee51\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143+\u4f30\u4ef7\u63d0\u9ad8350\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143", "title_en": "Ottawa-based Assent Compliance, a SaaS provider that helps companies with product compliance, trade compliance, and ESG, raises $350M at a $1B+ valuation", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/canadas-assent-compliance-lands-350m-from-vista-equity-for-supply-chain-data-management/", "via": "", "real_tags": []}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072494, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u62db\u8058\u65b0\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u65b0\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u6211\u60f3\u84b8\u53d1\u4e00\u4e9b\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u8fd9\u7bc7\u5e16\u5b50\u6d89\u53ca\u6211\u7684\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u662f\u5bf9'T\u5f62\u4eba\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u5373\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u3002 T\u5f62\u4eba\u7269\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0eI\u5f62\u4eba\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u79f0\u4e3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002 1\uff0c\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u72b6\u6001\uff0c2\u4e2aT\u5f62PeoLteare\u5bfb\u6c42\u5546\u54c1\uff1a\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u201c\u6846\u67b6\u675c\u7a74\u201d\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u51e0\u5e74\u5185\u4ee4\u4eba\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u7684T\u5f62\u4eba\u585e\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u9152\u5427\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5b89\u59ae\u7279\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u6761\uff0c\u5373\u65b0\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u52a0\u73ed\u3002 3.\n\u73b0\u5728\u8981\u505a\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u6211\u6b63\u5728\u5199\u8fd9\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u5728\u4e2a\u4eba\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u826f\u597d\u7684I\u5f62\u548cT\u5f62\u7684\u4eba\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u90fd\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u62db\u8058\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u56e2\u961f\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u5f00\u59cb\u66f4\u559c\u6b22\u4ee5T\u5f62\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7ef4\u6301\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u6211\u53ca\u65f6\u6293\u4f4f\u4e86\u81ea\u5df1\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u66f4\u52a0\u5173\u6ce8\u8fd9\u4e00\u504f\u96f7\u7684\u504f\u89c1 - \u6211\u5e0c\u671b\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u4f1a\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\uff01\n\u6211\u751a\u81f3\u770b\u5230\u672a\u805a\u7126\u7684\u672f\u8bed\u88ab\u629b\u51fa\u7684\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u3002\u8bf7\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u8fd9\u53d1\u751f\u5728AnInterview\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u771f\u7684\u6ca1\u6709\u5224\u65ad\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u91cd\u70b9\uff01 \u21a9\ufe0e", "note_en": "Being on the lookout for recruiting new students for  my new researchgroup, I wanted to distil some of my observationsinto textual form. This post deals with my impression that academia isdoing a disservice to \u2018T-shaped persons,\u2019 i.e.  persons combining deepexpertise in one or more fields with an ability to collaborate acrossareas. T-shaped personsare often contrasted with I-shaped persons, commonly known as experts.  1Given the state of the art in the software industry,  2 T-shaped peopleare a sought-for commodity: the current \u2018framework du jour\u2019 might beobsolete in a few years, but the horizontal bar of a T-shaped personensures that they can also contribute to other aspects of a project, andquite likely will develop new vertical bars, i.e. new expertise overtime.  3\n Output above all else.As I am looking at the many resumes and motivational letters fromexcellent students all over the globe, it occurred to me that academiais not necessarily kind to the Ts: the primary metric in academic hiringis still the \u2018scientific output,\u2019 which is measured in publications suchas journal articles, conference articles, etc. In machine learningresearch, the fast pace of the field now has created a situation inwhich even aspiring Ph.D. candidates are often expected to have a fewpublications under the belt already. Coming from mathematics, whereone paper  every few years\u00a0(!) is considered the mark ofa productive mathematician, these expectations are bonkers to me, andI wonder how many capable candidates end up pursuing other goals becauseof these invisible barriers.  4\n Hiring people: I before T.In any case, many graduate schools and resume reviewers tend to  ignorethe breadth of a person\u2019s skills, focusing instead only on the depth. Bytaking the scientific output, in conjunction with maybe some relevantcoursework, as the be-all and end-all, any other skills tend tobe missed. At best, it might raise an eyebrow or two in magnanimoussurprise: falling prey to precisely the issue I describe in this post,I noticed myself doing this for candidates that already convinced mebecause of their academic track record! At worst, additional skillsmight be considered detrimental upon review, because a T-shaped personmay have a smaller number of papers than others.  5\n This is a  problem for machine learning research. Given theaforementioned fast pace in the field, excellent research necessitatesmoving away from silos! There will of course always be a demand forpeople that have deep domain expertise, but many facets of contemporaryresearch can be addressed just as well by a T-shaped person, in myexperience.\n Ts as multipliers.Throughout my career, the most impactful projects always had a T-shapedperson onboard. This person would usually not be an expert in thesubject matter, but would be able to provide the direly-needed scaffolding and foundation of a project that is all too often ignoredin the initial phase, until it comes back later on with full swing towreak havoc. This includes, for instance:\n  In my experience, these skills\u2014and others\u2014are not commonly considered when hiringsomeone. And to some extent, having fallen into the same trap, I fullyunderstand this! Paraphrasing  Leonard McCoy in Star Trek,we want to state \u2018I\u2019m a researcher, not a(n) $X$,\u2019 with $X \\in$ $\\{$softwaredeveloper, designer, marketing person, artist, $\\dots\\}$\n Progress in our interdisciplinary times, however, also requires peoplethat are sufficiently skilled to tackle these  other tasks. Even thoughsuch tasks might seemingly be unrelated to the overall scientific goalof creating new knowledge, they are still a fundamental part of themodern process of scientific inquiry.\n What to do now? I am writing this post because I detected aninconsistency in my personal observations and my actions: virtually allthe projects that contained a good mix of I-shaped and T-shaped personssucceeded extraordinarily well. Yet, upon recruiting my own team,I started to prefer I-shaped profiles over T-shaped ones, instead ofstriving for a solid balance. I caught myself in time and willsubsequently pay more attention to this bias of mine\u2014I hope thatothers will do the same!\n Machine learning and academia in general are enriched by teamscomprising diverse backgrounds and personalities. We should strive toachieve this.\n (In case more incentives are needed: the largest groups and researchdivisions are already doing this\u2014they are hiring not only for academicoutput, but also based on general software skills, for instance. If it\u2019sgood enough for them, it should certainly be good enough for the rest ofus.)\n  There is a veritable zoo of characters of the alphabet, trying tocapture the elusive properties of people out there in the realworld. It should be understood that I do not even for a second thinkthat one pithy letter is sufficient to describe a real person;all of these characterisations are merely hinting towards certainproperties. As always in real life, there are many different shadeson a spectrum to consider here.\u00a0 \u21a9\ufe0e\n My views pertain only to jobs that have a distinct softwaredevelopment component. I lack personal experience about other typesof jobs and would love to learn more about them.\u00a0 \u21a9\ufe0e\n Over time, one might think that a T-shaped person thus turns intoa comb-like pattern.

Unveiled at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show, the machine combines the 8R tractor, a TruSet-enabled chisel plow, a GPS guidance system, and advanced technologies. \u00a0 \u201cThe global population is expected to grow from about 8 billion to nearly 10 billion people by 2050, increasing global food demand by 50%,\u201d says Jahmy Hindman, chief technology officer at John Deere. \u201cFarmers must also work through the variables like changing weather conditions, variations in soil quality, and managing weeds and pests \u2013 all of which impact the ability to farm during critical times of the year.\u201d  Equipped with six pairs of stereo cameras that enable 360\u00b0 obstacle detection and distance calculation, the images are passed through a network that classifies each pixel in about 100 milliseconds. This determines whether the machine continues or stops. In addition, the machine continuously checks its position relative to a geofence to ensure it is operating where it is supposed to, within less than an inch of accuracy. \t\u00a0 \t\u201cThe autonomous 8R tractor collected more than 50 million images during in-field testing for the last three years,\u201d says Willy Pell, VP autonomy and new ventures at John Deere.\n   Once transported to the field, a farmer configures the machine for autonomous operation. Using the John Deere Operations Center mobile app, a simple swipe starts the autonomous tractor. While it works, a farmer can leave the field to focus on other tasks, yet still monitor the machine remotely from a mobile device. Access to live video, images, data, and metrics allows a farmer to adjust speed, depth, and more.\n  Should an anomaly or an issue appear in the field, a farmer will be alerted and be able to adjust, so the machine\u2019s performance is optimized. The autonomous 8R tractor can prep 325 acres in 24 hours.\n \u201cThe autonomous 8R tractor is doing something that was once thought impossible,\u201d says Julian Sanchez, director, emerging technology for John Deere.\u00a0\u201cThis machine is creating a digital footprint of the farm.\u201d \t\u00a0 \tDeere says the autonomous 8R tractor will be available later this year.\n      For related content and insights from industry experts, sign up for Successful Farming newsletters.

It also supports RemNote, IdeaFlow, Mem, and Notion, and adding additional systems isn\u2019t too difficult.\n One of the usability perks of Go Note Go is that there is no monitor. This means you can\u2019t get distracted browsing the internet while writing on Go Note Go. You also can\u2019t get distracted wordsmithing your own writing. It makes writing pleasurable, even if it comes at the cost of having typos and stray thoughts in your writing; you can always clean those up later.\n Go Note Go does a lot more, so I do encourage you to  learn more about it, but it isn\u2019t the focus of this post, which is about sending messages.For the purposes of this post, Go Note Go is a data entry system for Roam. And since I\u2019ve also built a system that allows sending messages directly from Roam, this means I can now send messages directly from Go Note Go. So, I can send messages when driving, camping, and as I drift off to sleep at night.\n To send a message in Go Note Go, you simply \u201c@\u201d the person you are writing to. To send a message to Adriana, I would write \u201c@Adriana Message goes here\u201d. To send a message to David Dohan (using first and last name), I could write \u201c@David Dohan: Message goes here\u201d. You can @ someone at any point in the message. You can also @ multiple people, and Messager will send them a group message.\n Go Note Go acts as an outliner now too; this is both a big usability improvement for Go Note Go on it\u2019s own, and doubly so for using Go Note Go as a messager. An \u201coutliner\u201d is a system for taking notes as a series of nested bullets. You can push tab to indent notes underneath other notes; I\u2019ve developed a user experience that makes this moderately natural, even in the absence of a monitor or any other visual feedback. For sending messages, the outliner feature is a boon. Any notes you nest under an @\u2019d note will also register as additional messages for the @\u2019d recipients. This makes writing longer multiline messages a pleasure, even without a monitor.\n The default behavior of my messaging system is to hold the messages for approval before sending them. So, the messages that I write as I drift off to sleep don\u2019t send as I drift off to sleep. Instead, I see them in the morning and approve them, and only upon being approved are they sent automatically.\n This delayed-approve-then-send approach is particularly well suited for Go Note Go, where I likely make typos and want to clean up the messages before they are sent, since I am writing them without a monitor. Later in the post I\u2019ll dive into what the approval process looks like (tl;dr there\u2019s a spreadsheet where I can mark a message as \u201cOK\u201d to send), but first I want to share additional benefits of being able to send messages directly from my note-taking app, which is currently Roam Research.\n  Anything I write on my Go Note Go appears in Roam Research, but I can also take notes directly in Roam.Just like on Go Note Go, the way to draft a message in Roam is to \u201c@\u201d the person you are writing to.Messager has some heuristics it uses to translate your @\u2019s into proper recipients.So, the syntax for @\u2018ing someone isn\u2019t too strict.\n Using Roam offers some possibilities beyond what I can do on Go Note Go, such as including images in messages.Like on Go Note Go, you can use nested bullets to create longer messages,and you can @ as many people as you want for a message.In Roam, however, you can also include images in your messages.Messager will intelligently send those in the native format used by the underlying messaging service,rather than blindly sending the markdown stored in Roam.I find this feature, being able to use images naturally in Roam, and then have them send naturally as messages,quite pleasant.\n One future direction I\u2019d like for this project is to add a \u201csend\u201d button in Roam next to any messages I\u2019ve drafted there,as well as to display the status of the messages inline in my notes. That\u2019s not implemented now, but would be a nice-to-have for the future.\n Today, all messages are automatically added to my \u201cmessager queue\u201d where they wait for approval before being sent.I like having this approve-before-sending approach as the default, since it psychologically frees me up to write things I might not otherwise write if I was instead using a send button that sent immediately.However, sometimes being able to send something immediately is desirable, and that\u2019s not a clean option in the current setup.\n  Any messages in Roam (whether entered directly into Roam, or entered via Go Note Go), are automatically added to a spreadsheet, the \u201cMessager Queue\u201d. These are the spreadsheet\u2019s columns:\n  The Messager Queue sheet is filtered by default to show all pending messages. For each message it shows the  Service on which it will be sent and well as the  Recipient of the message. The service can be one of FB Messenger, Twitter, iMessage, a Slack server, or Discord. The recipient can either be an individual, a list of individuals, a group, a Slack channel, or a Discord server and channel.\n There\u2019s also a sheet that lists aliases, so it\u2019s easy to use a short name or informal name to refer to a longer service or recipient; e.g. I use \u201c@Audio Tools\u201d as a shorthand for sending to a group of 5 people on Messenger all interested in audio tools for networked thought.\n The Messager Queue sheet also displays the  Text of the message to send, so you can easily clean up the message here for any typos or clarifications before it is sent.\n The  Date and  Time columns allow for scheduling messages to be sent at any point in the future. Leave them blank and the message will be sent as soon as it is approved. Use keyboard shortcuts cmd-; (for date) and cmd-shift-; (for time) to quickly fill out these columns if desired.\n Finally, the  Approval column is the most important. Mark a messages as OK if you want it to be sent, or as Ignored if you deside to skip it. The  Status column is updated automatically by Messager when the message is sent (or if it fails to send, then the error appears here). You can also mark the Status manually with whatever value you want (e.g. if you send the message manually), and the Messager system will ignore that message going forward. If you want the system to retry sending a message, simply clear out the Status column and it will try again.\n I include this spreadsheet as a custom service in  Ferdi, so it lives alongside all the messaging apps I use. (This in itself might be the subject of a future  snippet.)\n  Beyond allowing me to catch a bunch of typos, it\u2019s also a psychologically useful thing for me.I am more willing to write and I feel able to say more things that I might not otherwise,knowing I have the opportunity to cancel or change the message later.In that way, it\u2019s like gmail\u2019s undo feature. In gmail, undo not a true undo, but having those 30 seconds after clicking send to retract the message make a big difference.\n Another benefit of sending the messages only after approving them is the ability to sleep at night. If I write a message at night, I know you haven\u2019t responded yet because my messages haven\u2019t even sent yet; they\u2019ll go out in the morning, after I\u2019ve had a chance to clean them up. So, I don\u2019t spend any mental effort wondering if there\u2019s a response from you. It also allows me to set the appropriate tone for the messages, by having them go out at a reasonable time, rather than appearing urgent by being sent in the middle of the night. And it does this without me needing to keep the message draft in my head as I sleep. So, I sleep better.\n This is why, while the ability to send messages immediately would also be a good feature to add, I am inclined to leave approve-in-the-morning messages as the system\u2019s default behavior.\n  One additional small usability feature is that Bieber Bot will message me in the morning or evening whenever there are messages in the Messager Queue awaiting my approval.\n This sounds like a small convenience, and in fact has proven even more useful than it might at first sound.When I wake up in the morning, I sometimes don\u2019t remember that I\u2019ve written messages the preceding night.So, having Bieber Bot send me the link to the Messager Queue and gently remind me to approve the messages has beenconsistently charming and welcome. Thanks, Bieber Bot.\n  Messager is the underlying system that sends the messages in the Messager Queue system.As noted previously, it supportsFacebook Messenger, Twitter,Slack, Discord, and iMessage.It also supports Hacker News, which hasn\u2019t been so useful for this project.And I am thinking I may add gChat and email support next.\n I use Messager for more than just sending messages from the Messager Queue spreadsheet;it also backs other projects like my  Kangaroo Auto-responder and  several parts of Bieber Bot.Its purpose, in the most broad sense, is to support programmatically sending and receiving messages in a uniform manner across all the messaging systems I use.\n For Facebook Messager, it uses  fbchat to enable programmatically sending and receiving messages as myself. It also uses Facebook\u2019s API to allow sending messages as Bieber Bot.\n For Twitter, it uses the API to support public tweets, private tweets (using a separate account;  see here for how I use this to reclaim my attention), and DMs.\n  Slack and Discord are the most recent additions, and they currently live outside the core Messager system;they are implemented using Browserflow flows.This means that I am effectively sending Slack and Discord messages as myself, rather than using an API to do so.The messages are sent in a browser using clicks and keyboard presses,all in the same human-centric UI that I would use if I were to send the messages manually.I\u2019m so grateful to Browserflow for making this possible, as Slack and Discord have been really key additions to this project.\n  I\u2019ve been using the setup for only a few days so far, and am continuing to actively develop it.So far, I absolutely love it.\n The headless typing experience provided by Go Note Go makes for a great environment for drafting messages.So too does using Roam Research while scrolling through social media. (I\u2019m the sort of person who doesn\u2019t usually like replying publicly to social media posts, but does enjoy engaging with them in 1:1 or small group chat messages.)Drifting off to sleep has proven to be another excellent time to share thoughts with friends.I don\u2019t want to start  a conversation with friends as I drift off to sleep, but loads of thoughts come to mind that I do want to share with people, and so adding them to my Messager Queue to send the next day has been quite satisfying.\n If this interests you, feel free to get in touch.If you do, I\u2019ll do my best to get back to you, likely as I\u2019m drifting off to sleep.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:19:00", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7761\u7720,messages,\u6d88\u606f", "title": "\u5f53\u6211\u6f02\u79fb\u5230\u7761\u7720\u65f6\u53d1\u9001\u6d88\u606f", "title_en": "Sending messages as I drift off to sleep", "transed": 1, "url": "https://davidbieber.com/post/2022-01-08-new-messager-setup/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7761\u7720", "messages", "\u6d88\u606f"]}]
