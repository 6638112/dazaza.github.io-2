The purpose of this paper is to explore the evidence of fasting, caloric restriction and the ketogenic diet and it&#39;s correlation to cancer. As well as exploring the advent of agriculture as the cause of cancer. The arguments are analyzed from a logical standpoint using the first principles approach.</p><p>该理论认为，地球上的大多数人，尤其是那些来自寒冷环境的后代，正在罹患癌症和疾病，因为他们在冬季和春季缺少长期的禁食、热量限制和生酮饮食，这在他们的祖先中很普遍；生活。本文的目的是探索禁食、热量限制和生酮饮食的证据及其#39；这与癌症有关。以及探索农业作为癌症病因的出现。使用第一原理方法从逻辑角度分析这些论点。</p><p>  I graduated from Uppsala University in 2018 where I majored in Information Systems which can be concluded as the study and analysis of different systems, be it systems in nature, information technology or psychology. I minored in Software Engineering. Since Yoshinori Ohsumi won the Nobel Prize in 2016 on autophagy, I started doing intermittent fasting and advancing to eating one meal a day since 2020-01-01 (with a few breaks here and there). Also I incorporated some longer fasting intervals sporadically. I also find it interesting to speculate about evolution and how different genetics affect our day-to-day lives. However, I&#39;m not educated in this subject, I&#39;m only a reader and have tried to speculate a conclusion based on information around the topic.</p><p>我于2018年毕业于乌普萨拉大学，主修信息系统，可以总结为对不同系统的研究和分析，无论是自然系统、信息技术还是心理学。我辅修软件工程。自2016年大须佳彦（Yoshinori Ohsumi）获得自噬诺贝尔奖以来，我开始断断续续地禁食，并从2020年1月1日开始每天吃一顿饭（偶尔休息）。此外，我还偶尔加入一些较长的禁食时间间隔。我还发现，推测进化以及不同的基因如何影响我们的日常生活很有趣。然而，我&#39；我没有受过这方面的教育，我&#39；我只是一个读者，并试图根据有关主题的信息推测出一个结论。</p><p>   Cancer is the second highest cause of deaths, where cardiovascular diseases take first place, according to data collected from 2017 (Roser and Ritchie 2015). The techniques used in this theory would probably eliminate cardiovascular disease but I&#39;m only focused on cancer for the topic of this paper. My speculation is that cancer started to significantly develop alongside the constant consumption of carbohydrates, probably caused by agriculture and the availability of carbohydrates. We can base some assumption that the current society is suffering from cancer, however there is little to no evidence that pre-agriculture society was suffering from cancer. Johnson (2010) found the oldest remains of cancer to date back to 2700 years ago. The specimen was found to have a form of prostate cancer, and according to Kaiser et al. (2020), prostate cancer has a direct association with insulin resistance. They found that a low carbohydrate/ketogenic diet should be favored for their superior impact on metabolic parameters. This does support the theory based on that the advent of agriculture started getting traction around 7000 to 10000 years ago, where carbohydrate consumption rose, alongside with insulin resistance. Meaning that no statistically significant evidence has been found for cancer deaths, pre-agriculture.</p><p>根据2017年收集的数据（Roser和Ritchie 2015），癌症是第二大死亡原因，心血管疾病居首位。这个理论中使用的技术可能会消除心血管疾病，但我&#39；我在本文的主题中只关注癌症。我的推测是，随着碳水化合物的不断消耗，癌症开始显著发展，这可能是由农业和碳水化合物的可用性引起的。我们可以基于当前社会患癌症的一些假设，但是几乎没有证据表明前农业社会患癌症。约翰逊（2010）发现了2700年前最古老的癌症遗骸。该标本被发现患有某种形式的前列腺癌，根据Kaiser等人（2020年）的研究，前列腺癌与胰岛素抵抗直接相关。他们发现，低碳水化合物/生酮饮食对代谢参数的影响更大，因此应该受到青睐。这确实支持了一个理论，即农业的出现大约在7000到10000年前开始受到重视，碳水化合物消耗量增加，同时胰岛素抵抗。也就是说，在农业生产之前，还没有发现有统计意义的癌症死亡证据。</p><p> Li (2014) shows some statistics in his Ted talk, where he explains that 40% of women in their 40s and 50s actually have microscopic breast cancers, 50% of men in their 50s and 60s have microscopic prostate cancers, and viritually 100% of us when we reach our 70s will have microscopic thyroid cancers. These will however not develop further because they lack a angiogenisis (blood supply).</p><p>Li（2014）在他的Ted演讲中展示了一些统计数据，他在演讲中解释说，40%的40岁和50岁的女性实际上患有显微镜下的乳腺癌，50%的50岁和60岁的男性患有显微镜下的前列腺癌，而实际上，我们70多岁时100%的人会患有显微镜下的甲状腺癌。然而，由于缺乏血管生成（血液供应），这些疾病不会进一步发展。</p><p> Bray et al. (2018) investigated some statistics about cancer rates in developed countries. They found that, on average, every type of cancer in both sexes was 2.5 times more prevalent in society with a high Human Development Index.</p><p>布雷等人（2018年）调查了发达国家癌症发病率的一些统计数据。他们发现，平均而言，在人类发展指数较高的社会中，每种类型的癌症在男女中的患病率都要高出2.5倍。</p><p>  DeLauer (2019) simplifies the complex cancer growth processes in a video, highlighting that most cancer cells differ from regular cells in how they are converting energy to proliferate. He references a recent study by Hsieh et al. (2019) where they conclude that cell glycolysis is the main cause for cancer growth, but also not a very efficient one, meaning that most cancers respond to high insulin and blood-glucose levels to grow and that cancer use high amounts of glucose to grow a very small amount. Lowering the blood-glucose level was shown to inhibit cancer growth and switching to a ketogenic diet was shown to completely starve the cancer. It was concluded that (most) cancer cells can&#39;t convert ketones for growth. Poff et al. (2014) writes in their paper on the survival rate in mice with metastatic cancer, and they mention that cancer cells express an abnormal metabolism characterized by increased glucose consumption, and that, just supplementing ketones, resulted in a greater survival rate.</p><p>DeLauer（2019）在一段视频中简化了复杂的癌症生长过程，强调大多数癌细胞在如何将能量转化为增殖方面与常规细胞不同。他引用了谢等人（2019年）最近的一项研究，他们得出结论，细胞糖酵解是癌症生长的主要原因，但也不是一个非常有效的原因，这意味着大多数癌症对高胰岛素和高血糖水平的生长作出反应，癌症使用高剂量的葡萄糖来生长非常小的量。研究表明，降低血糖水平可以抑制癌症的生长，而改用生酮饮食则可以彻底饿死癌症。结论是（大多数）癌细胞可以&#39；t转化酮以促进生长。Poff等人（2014年）在他们关于转移性癌症小鼠生存率的论文中写道，他们提到癌细胞表现出以葡萄糖消耗增加为特征的异常代谢，并且仅仅补充酮类就导致了更高的生存率。</p><p> This notion is also supported by Gannett (2016) where she explains that she has stopped the growth of a malignant brain cancer, as well as curing polycystic ovarian disease, Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis and pre-stage breast fibroids cancers, using the ketogenic diet. Berg (2020) explains in his talk that a human body running on ketones is much healthier compared to one that uses glucose as fuel. His main points are that tumors can&#39;t grow on ketones and that a ketogenic diet doesn&#39;t increase insulin as much as a regular glucose diet would.</p><p>Gannett（2016）也支持这一观点，她解释说，她已经阻止了恶性脑癌的生长，并治愈了多囊卵巢疾病，桥本&#39；使用生酮饮食治疗甲状腺炎和前期乳腺肌瘤癌。伯格（2020）在他的演讲中解释说，与使用葡萄糖作为燃料的人体相比，使用酮的人体更健康。他的主要观点是肿瘤可以&#39；不能靠酮生长，而且生酮饮食不会&#39；不要像常规的葡萄糖饮食那样增加胰岛素。</p><p> D’Agostino (2013) explains in his ted talk that he researched the effect on ketones as a cure for oxygen and pressure based seizures in navy seal divers. He explains multiple examples of people that have used the ketogenic diet as a cure for epilepsy and they are using ketone supplements as a cure for the navy seal divers. He later points out that cancer cells can only use large amounts of glucose as energy and are unable to proliferate on ketones. He quotes professor Thomas Seyfried, the author of Cancer is a metabolic disease. Lunt (2016) also talks about how cancer is extremely dependent on sugar, and she also speaks of how some cancer cells can rewire their own glucose metabolism based on the availability of oxygen. D’Agostino (2013) also did some research on cancer cells and oxygen where he found evidence that a high oxygen environment was highly effective at destroying cancer cells.</p><p>达戈斯蒂诺（2013）在ted演讲中解释说，他研究了酮对海军海豹突击队潜水员氧和压力性癫痫发作的治疗作用。他解释了多个使用生酮饮食治疗癫痫的例子，他们正在使用酮补充剂治疗海豹突击队潜水员。他后来指出，癌细胞只能使用大量葡萄糖作为能量，不能在酮上增殖。他引用了《癌症是一种代谢性疾病》一书的作者托马斯·塞弗里德教授的话。Lunt（2016）还谈到了癌症是如何极度依赖糖的，她还谈到了一些癌细胞是如何根据氧气的可用性重新连接自己的葡萄糖代谢的。达戈斯蒂诺（2013）还对癌细胞和氧气进行了一些研究，他发现证据表明，高氧气环境在摧毁癌细胞方面非常有效。</p><p> Harper (2020) presents a few interesting findings on the ketogenic diet. He explains a graph called the axis of illness, where the base cause is carbohydrates which leads to insulin resistance which leads to obesity which leads to inflammation. He notes that, just simply switching to a ketogenic diet would eliminate approximately 70% of chronic diseases. He also goes on about cancer and confirms that cancer cells are dependent on glucose for fuel, and he shows an interesting theory where his hypothesis is that glucose and insulin are very strong growth factors in the body and by lowering them, using the ketogenic diet, allows the immune system to catch cancer cells before it spreads. His latest study on ketogenic adaptation explored the effects on women with terminal breast cancer at stage four, where they supplied them with a ketogenic diet alongside chemotherapy. This resulted in extreme cancer regression after six weeks.</p><p>Harper（2020）提出了一些关于生酮饮食的有趣发现。他解释了一个叫做“疾病轴”的图表，其中的基本原因是碳水化合物，它导致胰岛素抵抗，从而导致肥胖，从而导致炎症。他指出，只要简单地改用生酮饮食就能消除大约70%的慢性病。他还谈到了癌症，并证实癌细胞依赖葡萄糖作为燃料，他展示了一个有趣的理论，他的假设是葡萄糖和胰岛素是体内非常强大的生长因子，通过降低它们，使用生酮饮食，免疫系统可以在癌细胞扩散之前捕获它们。他关于生酮适应的最新研究探索了晚期乳腺癌患者在第四阶段的影响，在第四阶段，他们在化疗的同时提供生酮饮食。这导致癌症在六周后严重消退。</p><p> Li (2014) explains that all cancers are dependent on mutated angiogenesis for growth. He also demonstrates that cancer cells can be efficiently removed by anti-angiogenesis compounds. Woolf et al. (2015) explores the effect a ketogenic diet has on angiogenesis in mice, they noted that angiogenesis is significantly reduced on a ketogenic diet. Woolf et al. also summerizes the ketogenic diet:</p><p>Li（2014）解释说，所有癌症的生长都依赖于突变的血管生成。他还证明，抗血管生成化合物可以有效去除癌细胞。Woolf等人（2015）探讨了生酮饮食对小鼠血管生成的影响，他们指出，生酮饮食显著减少了血管生成。Woolf等人还总结了生酮饮食：</p><p> &#34;The mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor benefits of the ketogenic diet, caloric restriction (and intermittent fasting) and other potential metabolic therapies have not yet been fully elucidated; however, preclinical data strongly suggests that metabolic alteration may be a highly effective therapy and may in fact enhance the current standard of care for malignant gliomas.&#34;</p><p>&#34;生酮饮食、热量限制（和间歇性禁食）和其他潜在代谢疗法的抗肿瘤作用机制尚未完全阐明；然而，临床前数据强烈表明，代谢改变可能是一种非常有效的治疗方法，事实上可能会提高目前恶性胶质瘤的治疗标准&#34;</p><p>  A recent study from Tendler et al. (2021) measures the change in hormones based on the different seasons. They concluded that, like all other animals, humans also have different winter-spring peaks in hormones for reproduction, growth, metabolism and stress adaptation. The study suggested that humans have a circannual clock that can keep track of the seasons, regulating hormones based on the seasons. The observed changes were in the hormones, cortisol, ACTH, T3, T4, TSH, estradiol, testosterone, LH, FSH, GH, IGF-1 and prolactin.</p><p>Tendler等人（2021年）最近的一项研究根据不同的季节测量了激素的变化。他们得出的结论是，与所有其他动物一样，人类在生殖、生长、新陈代谢和压力适应方面也有不同的冬春激素峰值。这项研究表明，人类有一个生物钟，可以跟踪季节，根据季节调节激素。观察到的变化包括激素、皮质醇、ACTH、T3、T4、TSH、雌二醇、睾酮、LH、FSH、GH、IGF-1和催乳素。</p><p>  Dr Françoise Wilhelmi de Toledo mentions in an interview with Buchinger Wilhelmi fasting institute, about the effect that fasting has on spring allergies. She uses fasting to resolve an allergy to birch pollen during April (Wilhelmi 2021).</p><p>Françoise Wilhelmi de Toledo博士在接受Buchinger Wilhelmi禁食研究所采访时提到禁食对春季过敏的影响。4月期间，她通过禁食来解决对桦树花粉过敏的问题（威廉米2021）。</p><p> There is also fasting incorporated in the major religions. Both Christianity and Islam have their major fasts usually between March and May. Judaism uses fasting more spread out throughout the year (Wikipedia 2021).</p><p>在主要宗教中也有禁食。基督教和伊斯兰教的主要斋戒时间通常在3月至5月之间。犹太教在一年中更多地使用禁食（维基百科2021）。</p><p>  Autophagy was first measured by Yoshinori Ohsumi, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 2016, where the processes is the natural, regulated mechanism of the cell that removes unnecessary or dysfunctional components. Autophagy is present in different states of life, but most notably after aerobic exercise or fasting (Wikipedia 2021). Berg (2020) mentions in his talk that he recommends patients to follow a consistent aerobic exercise regime for the benefits of autophagy and health. According to Tramazzo (2019) autophagy will trigger about 10 hours faster if the person is already in nutritional ketosis/fat adapted, amplifying its effects.</p><p>自噬最早由2016年获得诺贝尔生理学和医学奖的大须佳彦（Yoshinori Ohsumi）测量，其过程是细胞去除不必要或功能失调成分的自然调节机制。自噬存在于生命的不同状态，但最显著的是在有氧运动或禁食后（维基百科2021）。Berg（2020）在演讲中提到，为了自噬和健康，他建议患者遵循一致的有氧运动方案。根据Tramazzo（2019）的研究，如果患者已经处于营养性酮症/脂肪适应状态，自噬将更快触发约10小时，从而放大其影响。</p><p> One common misconception is that one has to be in a fasted state for autophagy to start, however, Chung and Chung (2019) explored the changes of the primary autophagy-related genes using caloric restriction. They found that autophagy-related genes in humans were significantly increased in response to a reduction in calories by 30 percent.</p><p>一个常见的误解是，人必须处于禁食状态才能开始自噬，然而，Chung和Chung（2019）利用热量限制探索了主要自噬相关基因的变化。他们发现，人体内的自噬相关基因随着卡路里减少30%而显著增加。</p><p>  In his presentation about therapeutic fasting, Fung (2016) goes into detail about the benefits of fasting and that the modern human is built to withstand repeated episodes where there is no food. He goes over that in a fasted state, the body increases it&#39;s energy expenditure and cell oxygen availability over four days of fasting, peaking at day three. He explains fasting as the way the body cleans out all the junk that accumilates.</p><p>在他关于治疗性禁食的演讲中，冯（2016）详细介绍了禁食的好处，以及现代人是为了承受没有食物的反复发作而构建的。他说，在禁食状态下，身体会增加它#39；在四天的禁食期间，婴儿的能量消耗和细胞氧的可用性在第三天达到峰值。他解释说，禁食是身体清除吸收的所有垃圾的方式。</p><p> Longo (2016) speaks about fasting and how it affects aging and diseases. He did some research with the IGF-1 receptor and genetically created mice with 50% of their normal size. He found that they would live almost 50% longer compared to normal mice alongside with the finding that they also would never develop any diseases, compared to 10% of the normal mice. He also shows his research from UCLA where they would starve worms, bacteria and yeast, and the outcome was that if you switch them from a lot of nutrients to only water, they would live much longer. Another reference of this is from Cheng et al. (2014) where they found that prolonged fasting reduces IGF-1 and promotes hematopoietic-stem-cell-based regeneration and reverse immunosuppression. Brandhorst (2015) did a study on a periodic fasting diet and found that mice on this diet would have an almost halved cancer rate, and they would experience cancer only in their later stages of life and the majority of tumors was benignant, compared to the control group where they would have it from early stages in life and majority was malignant.</p><p>Longo（2016）谈到了禁食及其对衰老和疾病的影响。他用IGF-1受体做了一些研究，并用基因创造了50%正常大小的小鼠。他发现，与正常小鼠相比，它们的寿命延长了近50%，同时发现它们也不会患任何疾病，而正常小鼠的寿命为10%。他还展示了他在加州大学洛杉矶分校的研究，在那里，它们会饿死蠕虫、细菌和酵母，结果是，如果你把它们从大量的营养物质改为只喝水，它们会活得更长。Cheng等人（2014年）也提到了这一点，他们发现长期禁食会降低IGF-1，促进造血干细胞再生和逆转免疫抑制。Brandhorst（2015）对周期性禁食饮食进行了研究，发现采用这种饮食的小鼠的癌症发病率几乎降低了一半，而且它们只会在生命后期患癌症，与对照组相比，大多数肿瘤是良性的，而对照组从生命早期就患癌症，大多数是恶性的。</p><p> Sinclair (2019) speaks of his research in anti-aging at Google. His techniques goes around the topic of epigenome manipulation and the prevention of aging, this will in turn prevent every disease that could be age related, including risk for developing cancer. He later mentions that a natural way to manipulate your epigenome is to eat less frequently, and he is currently following an intermittent fasting regime. He also answers a question from the audience on insulin and aging where he concludes that aging is a direct correlator with high insulin and blood-glucose levels. Also there is an important epigenome pathway-chemical called nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) which is correlated with nerve health and epigenome repairing. Mills et al. (2017) writes in a paper that NMN occurs naturally in different types of food such as: edamame, broccoli, cucumber seed, cucumber peel, cabbage, avocado, tomato, mushroom, raw beef and shrimp. All of which are low in carbohydrates.</p><p>Sinclair（2019）谈到了他在谷歌的抗衰老研究。他的技术围绕着表观基因组操作和预防衰老这一主题展开，这将反过来预防每一种可能与年龄有关的疾病，包括患癌症的风险。他后来提到，控制表观基因组的一种自然方式是少吃，他目前正在遵循间歇性禁食制度。他还回答了观众关于胰岛素和衰老的问题，他得出结论，衰老与高胰岛素和血糖水平直接相关。此外，还有一种重要的表观基因组途径化学物质称为烟酰胺单核苷酸（NMN），它与神经健康和表观基因组修复有关。Mills等人（2017）在一篇论文中写道，NMN自然存在于不同类型的食物中，例如：毛豆、花椰菜、黄瓜籽、黄瓜皮、卷心菜、鳄梨、番茄、蘑菇、生牛肉和虾。所有这些都是低碳水化合物。</p><p> Mokhtari et al. (2017) found that some plant foods contain sulforaphane, a compound that is able to specifically target cancer cells to induce apoptosis (programmed cell death). The plant foods include: broccoli sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, brussels sprouts, cabbage and bok choy. All of which are low in carbohydrates.</p><p>Mokhtari等人（2017年）发现，一些植物食品中含有萝卜硫素，这是一种能够特异性靶向癌细胞以诱导凋亡（程序性细胞死亡）的化合物。植物食品包括：花椰菜芽、花椰菜、花椰菜、羽衣甘蓝、芽甘蓝、卷心菜和白菜。所有这些都是低碳水化合物。</p><p> Li (2014) has a list of anti-angiogenic foods. Some of them are: green tea, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, oranges, bok choy, kale, ginseng, maitake mushroom, licorice, turmeric, artichokes, lavender, pumpkin, tuna, parsley, garlic, tomato, olive oil and dark chocolate. All of which are low in carbohydrates.</p><p>Li（2014）列出了一系列抗血管生成食品。其中包括：绿茶、草莓、黑莓、覆盆子、橙子、白菜、甘蓝、人参、金针菇、甘草、姜黄、朝鲜蓟、薰衣草、南瓜、金枪鱼、欧芹、大蒜、番茄、橄榄油和黑巧克力。所有这些都是低碳水化合物。</p><p>  Caloric restriction has long been used as a measure for people to lose weight, but there are also appliances against disease. O’Flanagan et al. (2017) explored the effects that calorie restriction has on cancer patients. Their specification was to lower the patients&#39; caloric intake by 30 percent, without the incurrence of malnutrition. Their data suggest that caloric restriction acts against inflammation, angiogenesis, insulin and IGF-1. They also mention that a 30 percent reduction in calories in mice, displayed an overall 75.5 percent reduction in tumor incidence. They speculated that caloric restriction combined with a ketogenic diet, would probably increase that number.</p><p>长期以来，热量限制一直被用作人们减肥的手段，但也有一些预防疾病的器具。O’Flanagan等人（2017年）探讨了限制热量摄入对癌症患者的影响。他们的规格是降低患者#39；热量摄入减少30%，而不会导致营养不良。他们的数据表明，热量限制可以对抗炎症、血管生成、胰岛素和IGF-1。他们还提到，小鼠体内卡路里减少30%，肿瘤发病率总体上降低了75.5%。他们推测，热量限制加上生酮饮食可能会增加这个数字。</p><p>   What got me starting on this theory was a  documentary about how the Greenland vikings came to be, and how they lived. It&#39;s described that they lived on an extremely restrictive diet since nothing grew on Greenland. Most of their diet consisted of fish and seal. I got curious about that and came to the conclusion that people would probably have to adapt to their environment, that would then define their diet.</p><p>让我开始这个理论的是一部关于格陵兰维京人是如何形成的，以及他们是如何生活的纪录片。它&#39；s描述说，由于格陵兰岛上没有任何植物生长，他们的饮食非常严格。他们的饮食大多是鱼和海豹。我对此感到好奇，并得出结论，人们可能必须适应他们的环境，这将决定他们的饮食。</p><p>  The Paleolithic diet is well known in the literature to be a clear replicate of our ancestors&#39; diet. The diet consists of fresh lean meats, fish, shellfish, eggs, nuts, seeds, fruits, berries, vegetables and small amounts of honey. This diet breakdown would be low in carbohydrates except for some sparse times of the year, probably in summer when certain fruits and honey was available. Following this diet, paired with regular exercise and fasting, would leave any individual in ketosis for more or less their entire life. The Paleolithic era lasted from 2.5 million years ago until 9000 years ago, when we switched to an insulin spiking, carbohydrate based diet (Wikipedia 2022).</p><p>旧石器时代的饮食在文献中是众所周知的，是我们祖先的清晰复制品#39；饮食饮食包括新鲜瘦肉、鱼类、贝类、鸡蛋、坚果、种子、水果、浆果、蔬菜和少量蜂蜜。除了一年中的一些稀疏时间外，这种饮食分解的碳水化合物含量很低，可能是在夏天，那时可以买到某些水果和蜂蜜。遵循这种饮食，再加上定期锻炼和禁食，会让任何人或多或少地终生处于酮症状态。旧石器时代从250万年前一直持续到9000年前，那时我们转向以胰岛素和碳水化合物为基础的饮食（维基百科2022）。</p><p> Sebastian et al. (2002) explains that natural selection has had &lt; 1% of evolutionary time to adapt to our new modern diet from the advent of agriculture. They also measured the difference in acid net load of the Paleolithic diet compared to the western diet and found a mismatch between the nutrient composition of the diets and genetically determined nutritional requirements.</p><p>Sebastian等人（2002年）解释说，自然选择产生了&lt；1%的进化时间来适应农业出现后我们新的现代饮食。他们还测量了旧石器时代饮食与西方饮食的酸净负荷差异，发现饮食的营养成分与基因决定的营养需求不匹配。</p><p>  My idea here was that people who lived in the north, where winters were harsh, would probably not eat any vegetables during the long winters, because nothing grew. We know that people stocked up on food, but what would they do if the food would perish, they then would have to find food local to the environment. What is interesting about this is that carbohydrates are only prevalent in certain vegetables, and a purely carnivore diet contains almost no carbohydrates. Saladino (2020) talks about the carnivore diet and how skeletal analysis of early humans showed that they were almost exclusively carnivores. He also confirms that humans would eat based on their environment, and that the vegetables today looked nothing like they did for the early humans. He mentions that the domestication of popular vegetables have resulted in favoring the least toxic, the highest yielding and highest caloric version of that plant. And that the availability of plants was nowhere near as they are today. My thoughts on this is that humans probably lived mainly on a carnivore based diet, with a small amount of plants and carbohydrates, consumed in a supplementary way. That would explain the quick energy reaction the body has to carbohydrates.</p><p>我在这里的想法是，生活在北方的人们，那里的冬天很严酷，在漫长的冬天，他们可能不会吃任何蔬菜，因为没有什么东西生长。我们知道人们囤积食物，但如果食物会腐烂，他们会怎么做，然后他们必须找到当地环境的食物。有趣的是，碳水化合物只在某些蔬菜中普遍存在，纯肉食性饮食几乎不含碳水化合物。萨拉迪诺（Saladino，2020）谈到了食肉动物的饮食，以及早期人类的骨骼分析如何表明他们几乎完全是食肉动物。他还证实，人类会根据自己的环境进食，而今天的蔬菜看起来与早期人类完全不同。他提到，对受欢迎的蔬菜进行驯化后，人们倾向于选择毒性最小、产量最高、热量最高的蔬菜。而且植物的可利用性远不如今天。我的想法是，人类可能主要以食肉动物为基础，以补充的方式摄入少量植物和碳水化合物。这可以解释身体对碳水化合物的快速能量反应。</p><p> A recent study from Lennerz (2021) shows self reported evidence from people following the carnivore diet for at least 6 months. They concluded that adults consuming a carnivore diet experienced few adverse effects and instead reported health benefits and high satisfaction.</p><p>Lennerz（2021）最近的一项研究显示，食肉动物饮食至少持续6个月的人有自我报告的证据。他们得出的结论是，食用肉食性饮食的成年人几乎没有副作用，反而报告了健康益处和高满意度。</p><p> As the basis of my theory is that you should enter a ketogenic diet during winter and also do sessions of fasting, Saladino (2020) brings up a few studies where they observed an decrease in oxidative stress when people entered a carnivore diet. This could be connected to either the benefits of the ketogenic or the carnivore diet, however, I think that they are very similar.</p><p>萨拉迪诺（Saladino，2020）提出了一些研究，他们观察到，当人们进入肉食性饮食时，氧化应激降低。我的理论的基础是，你应该在冬季进行生酮饮食，也应该进行禁食。这可能与生酮饮食或食肉饮食的益处有关，然而，我认为它们非常相似。</p><p>  While researching ketosis, I found that it can cure a lot of diseases. Harper (2020) confirms this with his presumed, axis of illness. He explains the axis of illness as a connected model where eating a high frequent and high carbohydrate diet increases insulin resistance which then promotes inflammation and obesity, which then leads to more insulin resistance. This is a bad spiral and it will eventually lead to chronic disease. Harper estimates that 70% of chronic disease, but most notably, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and alzheimers, could be cured by just breaking this cycle. Now the question at hand, how long should you break the cycle to gain the benefits? Well in Harper&#39;s research they see a change in cancer growth and a metabolic change in just six weeks, so if you do this up to six months every winter I would assume that it has some effect. The literature also supports this, Byrne et al. (2017) found that periodic diet breaks work extremely well in a scenario of weight loss without muscle loss and metabolic slowdown.</p><p>在研究酮症时，我发现它可以治愈很多疾病。哈珀（2020）用他推测的疾病轴心证实了这一点。他将疾病轴解释为一个相互关联的模型，即频繁食用高碳水化合物饮食会增加胰岛素抵抗，进而促进炎症和肥胖，进而导致更多的胰岛素抵抗。这是一个恶性循环，最终会导致慢性病。哈珀估计，70%的慢性病，但最显著的是心血管疾病、癌症、糖尿病和老年痴呆症，只要打破这个循环就可以治愈。现在的问题是，你应该打破这个循环多久才能获得好处？在哈珀&#39；在美国的研究中，他们在六周内就能看到癌症生长的变化和新陈代谢的变化，所以如果你每年冬天都在六个月内这样做，我认为这会产生一些影响。文献也支持这一点，Byrne等人（2017年）发现，在没有肌肉损失和代谢放缓的情况下，周期性饮食休息在减肥的情况下效果非常好。</p><p> Bosworth (2019) talks about how ketones are a superior fuel for the brain and how a small supplementation of Medium-Chain Triglyceride (MCT) oil in a non-ketogenic diet, would increase the levels of ketones in the blood and in term lead to a larger brain engagement of all cells. This was most noted in older patients with lower brain function, lower memory function or alzheimers. She also speaks of diseases like, ADHD, parkinssons, epilepsy, depression as a result of chronic brain swelling and inflammation, we can probably assume that this is the axis of illness portrayed in the brain.</p><p>Bosworth（2019）谈到了酮如何成为大脑的高级燃料，以及在非生酮饮食中少量补充中链甘油三酯（MCT）油如何增加血液中的酮水平，并最终导致所有细胞在大脑中更大程度的参与。这在脑功能低下、记忆功能低下或阿尔茨海默症的老年患者中最为明显。她还提到了多动症、帕金森氏症、癫痫、慢性脑肿胀和炎症导致的抑郁症等疾病，我们可能认为这是大脑中描绘的疾病轴。</p><p> I also remember seeing some sources that newborns have a 70 times higher blood-ketone level compared to those in grown humans, maybe meaning that it&#39;s used for brain development in early stage in life. Why we see cancer in children could be that bad cell-components are inherited from the mother. Since the immune systems t-cells have a form of register to remember diseases, that would result in a sort of a learning period for the immune system to slowly adapt. And since it takes seven to ten years to replace every cell in one&#39;s body, we could assume that the cancer caused in children is probably inherited from the mother.</p><p>我还记得看到一些资料显示，新生儿的血液酮水平是成年人的70倍，这可能意味着&#39；在生命早期用于大脑发育。我们之所以在儿童身上看到癌症，可能是因为坏细胞成分是从母亲那里遗传来的。由于免疫系统的t细胞有一种形式的记忆疾病的寄存器，这将导致免疫系统有一个学习期来慢慢适应。由于一个电池需要七到十年的时间来更换&#39；我们可以假设，儿童身上的癌症可能是母亲遗传的。</p><p> Mikhaila Peterson (2022) explains how she had lived with severe arthritis, skin rashes and depression for years.

They found that resistance training could result in a permanent increase in muscle mitochondria, what is interesting about this is the function it could have had on ancient humans. What we know today is that a person with more mitochondria in their skeletal musculature will respond faster to resistance training and hypertrophy, rather than a person with less mitochondria. And if one can permanently adapt to an increase of mitochondri</p><p>Groennebaek和Vissing（2017）在他们的论文中写道，作为对阻力训练的反应，骨骼肌组织中线粒体的永久性适应功能。他们发现，抵抗力训练可以导致肌肉线粒体的永久性增加，有趣的是，这可能对古代人类有作用。我们今天所知道的是，骨骼肌组织中线粒体较多的人对阻力训练和肥大的反应会比线粒体较少的人更快。如果一个人能永久性地适应线粒体的增加</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/禁食/">#禁食</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/winter/">#winter</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/饮食/">#饮食</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
