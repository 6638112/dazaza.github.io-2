It seemed like a window into the kind of world you might want to join once you got out.</p><p>回到大学时，我真的很喜欢看《学徒》。这似乎是一扇窗户，让你一走出家门，就能了解到你可能想要加入的那种世界。</p><p> Then I read  The Art of the Deal — which we have since learned was ghost written by someone else (Lame!).</p><p>然后我读了《交易的艺术》(The Art Of The Deal)--后来我们才知道，这本书是别人写的鬼写的(差劲！)。</p><p> So, when I heard there was a  Trump University seminar in my area, I had to go. This was when Trump University was new and didn’t have bad press.</p><p>因此，当我听说特朗普大学(Trump University)在我所在的地区举办研讨会时，我不得不离开。这是特朗普大学刚刚成立，没有负面新闻的时候。</p><p>  Expensive hotel — the experience of affluence that he sells — and being told that the team that had been sent out was the very best of the best…</p><p>昂贵的酒店--他出售的是一种富裕的体验--被告知被派去的团队是最好的…中最优秀的。</p><p> The teachers were the best people, and even the event coordinator was the very best they had!</p><p>老师们是最好的人，就连活动协调员也是他们最好的！</p><p>  At the time, though, it was really cool to hear we had the very best people taking care of us.</p><p>不过，在那个时候，听到我们有最好的人照顾我们，这真的很酷。</p><p>  I went mostly out of curiosity, and I learned a lot so I was happy. For others though it may have been less good.</p><p>我主要是出于好奇心去的，我学到了很多东西，所以我很开心。不过，对其他人来说，情况可能没那么好。</p><p> At this point, I was in my first job out of college, doing some consulting work for a Fortune 500 company through a consulting firm. But that doesn’t mean that I was more than a cog in the machine.</p><p>在这一点上，我是大学毕业后的第一份工作，通过一家咨询公司为一家财富500强公司做一些咨询工作。但这并不意味着我不仅仅是机器上的一个齿轮。</p><p> From that perspective, what Trump University taught was quite enlightening. I learned interesting new things about both business and how the law affects things.</p><p>从这个角度来看，特朗普大学教授的内容相当有启发性。我学到了关于商业和法律如何影响事物的有趣的新事物。</p><p>  It was a very packed three-day affair, I’m just going to do an overview of two areas they might make one more money, that also reveal things about the game itself:</p><p>这是一个非常拥挤的为期三天的活动，我只想概述一下他们可能会多赚一分钱的两个领域，这也揭示了游戏本身的一些东西：</p><p>   The core of being able to flip a house fast is getting it so far below market price that you can make a profit selling it to someone else, who still thinks you’re offering a sweet deal!</p><p>能够快速卖出房子的核心是把它卖到远远低于市场价的水平，这样你就可以把它卖给其他人赚取利润，而其他人仍然认为你提供的是一笔不错的交易！</p><p>  The person selling their house to you either needs to be desperate to sell soon (motivated seller), or you need to convince them that their house is worth a whole lot less than it is. Or both.</p><p>把房子卖给你的人要么需要急于尽快卖掉(有动力的卖家)，要么你需要让他们相信他们的房子价值比实际价值低很多。或者两者兼而有之。</p><p> This is really an information game, and you need to find those deals and close them before other people find out about them.</p><p>这真的是一场信息游戏，你需要在其他人发现之前找到这些交易并完成交易。</p><p> As an example, a guy found a house listed for ~$500K that was worth ~$650K+ because the seller and their agent were from out of town and didn’t know any better. He made the offer right there and got it in writing.</p><p>举个例子，一个家伙发现了一套标价50万美元的房子，价值65万美元以上，因为卖家和他们的经纪人来自外地，对此一无所知。他当场就提出了报价，并以书面形式写了下来。</p><p> The next day, the seller got an offer for $650K — but the deal was already done. Game over!</p><p>第二天，卖家收到了65万美元的报价--但交易已经完成。游戏结束!。</p><p>  So, how were you supposed to find these really good deals as well as people to buy them?</p><p>那么，你应该如何找到这些真正划算的交易以及购买它们的人呢？</p><p>  The simplest way was just to put out ads that you have a well priced property for sale in an area.</p><p>最简单的方法就是发布广告，说你在某一地区有一套价格合理的房产要出售。</p><p> If you really didn’t, you just told them that it had been sold but that you could reach out to them when you got new deals, if they tell you what kinds of deals they are interested in.</p><p>如果你真的没有，你只是告诉他们房子已经卖出去了，但如果他们告诉你他们对哪种交易感兴趣，你可以在有新的交易时联系他们。</p><p> This isn’t unusual. Lots of people use this type of idea to build lists of qualified prospects.</p><p>这并不罕见。很多人使用这种想法来建立合格的潜在客户名单。</p><p>   Looking through public records to find people who might be in trouble or at risk of foreclosure.</p><p>查看公共记录，寻找可能陷入困境或面临丧失抵押品赎回权风险的人。</p><p> Looking through obituaries for the recently deceased whose heirs might need to sell property soon.</p><p>浏览最近去世的人的讣告，他们的继承人可能很快就需要出售财产。</p><p> Driving around and finding rundown homes that maybe the owner isn’t living in that are just a tax burden.</p><p>开车四处寻找破旧的房子，也许房主并不住在里面，这只是一种税收负担。</p><p> Building a network of people who would get a commission if they brought you a lead that resulted in deal.</p><p>建立一个人脉网络，如果他们给你带来交易的线索，他们就能拿到佣金。</p><p> Once you found these opportunities, you had to get an accurate sense of their worth, and convince the home owners that it was in fact worth a whole lot less.</p><p>一旦你发现了这些机会，你必须对它们的价值有一个准确的认识，并说服房主，这些机会实际上价值要低得多。</p><p> Then you’d get them to sign a contract to sell it, so you could shop it around to your investors.</p><p>然后你会让他们签一份合同来出售它，这样你就可以把它卖给你的投资者了。</p><p>  This is where things get dodgy. In order to have a high chance of making profit you need to get a number of things right. For example:</p><p>这就是事情变得棘手的地方。为了有很高的盈利机会，你需要做一些正确的事情。例如：</p><p> Don’t be a realtor, so you’re not subject to those laws! (exploiting that loophole!)</p><p>不要做房地产经纪人，这样你就不受那些法律的约束了！(利用这个漏洞！)。</p><p> Include a back out clause in the contract for you, but not the seller. Like “pending confirmation from my business partner” — If you can’t sell it for a profit, you just kill the deal! But the seller is stuck with you.</p><p>在合同中为你加入一项退约条款，而不是卖方。就像“等待我的商业伙伴的确认”--如果你不能出售它来盈利，你就会扼杀这笔交易！但是卖家被你困住了。</p><p> When you get the contract, go to the Title office and you muddy the title so the seller can’t sell it behind your back.</p><p>当你拿到合同的时候，去产权办公室，你把产权弄得一团糟，这样卖家就不能背着你卖了。</p><p> Do a double transfer at the title office, so that instead of the seller directly selling to the investor, they sell to you (for a second), and then you sell to the investor, but it’s the investor’s money that buys the house — your wallet is never exposed!  The benefit? The seller doesn’t find out you already made $20K selling their house!</p><p>在产权办公室进行双重转账，这样卖家就不会直接卖给投资者，他们会卖给你(一秒钟)，然后你再卖给投资者，但买房子的是投资者的钱--你的钱包永远不会暴露！好处是什么？卖家不会发现你卖了他们的房子已经赚了2万美元！</p><p> You can even give the seller a couple of thousand dollars extra so you look like a super nice guy — and get a testimonial out of them!</p><p>你甚至可以多给卖家几千美元，让你看起来像个超级好人--然后从他们那里得到一份证明！</p><p>  “No one had made a better offer to them, so who can say if they would’ve found a better deal. You definitely gave them the best offer they’ve gotten so far!”</p><p>“没有人给他们更好的报价，所以谁能说他们会不会找到更好的交易呢？”你绝对给了他们到目前为止最好的报价！“。</p><p> … The fact that a little lack of information can have large costs for people is quite sad.</p><p>…。信息的一点点匮乏可能会给人们带来巨大的代价，这一事实令人相当悲哀。</p><p>  Tax liens are interesting both for the high return you can get, and because they show you a little about how the government does business.</p><p>税收留置权很有趣，既是因为你可以获得高额回报，也是因为它们让你了解了政府是如何做生意的。</p><p> The idea is simple. If you owe taxes, the government may put a tax lien on your house.</p><p>想法很简单。如果你欠税，政府可能会对你的房子征收留置税。</p><p> Let’s say that you owe $1,000 in taxes on your home. Depending on the state, you may be hit with a tax lien and then have to pay an amount like $1,500… Or $2,000.</p><p>假设你的房子欠1,000美元的税。根据所在州的不同，你可能会受到税收留置权的打击，然后不得不支付大约1,500美元的…。或者2000美元。</p><p> These tax liens are auctioned off so that government gets all the money it planned to. As an investor, the chances of you getting the expected return are very good.</p><p>这些税收留置权被拍卖，这样政府就可以得到它计划的所有资金。作为投资者，你获得预期回报的机会非常大。</p><p> The interesting thing about tax liens is that — with the way the law is setup — if it’s not paid and you manage to successfully foreclose on one, you can usually get the house free and clear (with any remaining mortgages owed to banks erased).</p><p>关于税收留置权的有趣之处在于，按照法律的设置方式，如果你没有支付税款，而你成功地取消了其中一项的抵押品赎回权，你通常可以免费获得房屋，而且可以清偿(所有欠银行的剩余抵押贷款都会被抹去)。</p><p> Naturally, if there is a mortgage, the bank will usually pay you rather than end up losing a ton of money.</p><p>当然，如果有抵押贷款，银行通常会付钱给你，而不是最终损失一大笔钱。</p><p> But even so, this leads to the development of investment strategies that account for laws in different places, and your chances of events like the foreclosure succeeding, to maximize your projected profit.</p><p>但即便如此，这也会导致投资策略的发展，考虑到不同地方的法律，以及你成功止赎等事件的机会，以最大化你的预期利润。</p><p> It is worth noticing that this is a result of a government supposedly acting for the sake of its citizens. Decent businesses would not be as callous towards customers experiencing hardship.</p><p>值得注意的是，这是一个理应为公民着想的政府的结果。正派的企业不会对遭遇困难的客户如此冷酷无情。</p><p> You see this pattern elsewhere also. You couldn’t pay $200 in court fees? The debt was sold and now you owe $500 to the debt collector! Yay!</p><p>你在其他地方也可以看到这种模式。你连200美元的诉讼费都付不起？债务被卖掉了，现在你欠收债人500美元！耶！</p><p> It would seriously do the government good to have better business sense and more respect for its customers’ well being.</p><p>如果政府有更好的商业意识，更尊重客户的福祉，这将对政府有很大好处。</p><p>  During the ~$1,500 seminar, the instructors would push hard for you to hire a Trump University mentor for three days, full time for upwards of $30K.</p><p>在1500美元的研讨会期间，讲师们会极力要求你聘请一位特朗普大学的导师，为期三天，全职费用超过3万美元。</p><p> They’d even give you scripts for what to say to your bank to increase your credit limit so you could put it on your card!</p><p>他们甚至会给你脚本，告诉你该怎么跟你的银行说什么来提高你的信用额度，这样你就可以把它记在你的卡上了！</p><p> The idea was that during those three days, the mentors would help you close deals with their greater experience. And you would learn to do it right by seeing real experts in real life situations.</p><p>他们的想法是，在这三天里，导师会用他们丰富的经验帮助你达成交易。你可以通过在现实生活中见到真正的专家来学习如何做好这件事。</p><p> There were a ton of complaints around this, that people didn’t get much attention from the mentor after paying the money, and that most may not have made back the $30K+ during those three days.</p><p>围绕这一点有大量的抱怨，人们在支付了这笔钱后没有得到导师的太多关注，而且大多数人可能在这三天里没有拿回3万多美元。</p><p> Plus, some of the people who felt scammed were older people. I personally knew a retired USAF officer who I believe was in his 70s, who did put that $30K+ on his credit card.</p><p>此外，一些感觉被骗的人是老年人。我个人认识一位退休的美国空军军官，我相信他已经70多岁了，他确实在信用卡上刷了3万多美元。</p><p> IIRC, he was bailed out by his estranged son. So, where it didn’t end too badly for him, it must have still been pretty humiliating.</p><p>IIRC，他被分居的儿子保释出来。所以，在对他来说结局不是太糟糕的情况下，这肯定仍然是相当丢脸的。</p><p>  I don’t personally know someone who was happy after paying that $30K. But, I also didn’t know everyone in my group.</p><p>我个人不知道有谁在付了那3万美元后还会开心。但是，我也不认识我的小组里的每一个人。</p><p> It may be because this was early on for Trump University and it hadn’t quite turned into a money making machine yet. And maybe I’m being optimistic but, I didn’t feel that the instructors were actively trying to be dishonest with us.</p><p>这可能是因为这对特朗普大学来说还很早，它还没有完全变成一台赚钱机器。也许我太乐观了，但是，我并不觉得教官们在积极地试图对我们不诚实。</p><p> Even so, the setup for the three days of mentorship was risky. This is what you had to do to before those three days, so you could get the best results:</p><p>即便如此，为期三天的辅导安排还是有风险的。这是你在这三天之前必须做的事情，这样你才能得到最好的结果：</p><p> And then schedule all the meetings for the 3 day window when your mentor would be there.</p><p>然后在你的导师到场的3天内安排所有的会议。</p><p>  That’s a lot that you have to get perfect so you can really milk those 3 days.</p><p>这是一个很大的问题，你必须做到完美，这样你才能真正地在这3天里挤奶。</p><p>  You might be able to pull this off if you’re a super go getter, but then I wonder if you really need these mentors. If you can’t though, then that $30K+ is burned!</p><p>如果你是一个超级围棋好手，你或许可以做到这一点，但我想知道你是否真的需要这些导师。如果你做不到，那么这3万多美元就烧掉了！</p><p> The court filings also show that many of the instructors teaching these courses (at least later on), had themselves failed at real estate before joining Trump University…</p><p>法庭文件还显示，教授这些课程的许多讲师(至少后来)在加入特朗普大学…之前，自己在房地产行业失败了。</p><p> If you were stuck with one of those guys, even perfect execution wouldn’t be able to save you from the fact that your mentors themselves were incompetent.</p><p>如果你被这些家伙中的一个困住了，即使是完美的执行力也不能拯救你，因为你的导师本身就是无能的。</p><p>  What one expects from any respectable business is that the value offered exceeds the value they paid to get what they want (at least in the mind of the customer).</p><p>人们对任何一家体面企业的期望是，提供的价值超过他们为获得自己想要的东西而支付的价值(至少在客户心目中是这样)。</p><p> You at least have to aim to for  most customers being happy with your service… You can’t be a thief.</p><p>您至少必须致力于让大多数客户对您的服务…感到满意。你不可能是小偷。</p><p> The way Trump handled this, and the way he seems to have handled many other projects; it looks like he doesn’t care enough about the real details of how the businesses will provide the value they promise.</p><p>特朗普处理这件事的方式，以及他似乎处理过许多其他项目的方式；看起来他对企业如何提供承诺的价值的真正细节不够关心。</p><p> Often, he’s really just selling his name and the public image he’s created of living the rich lifestyle that people aspire towards.</p><p>很多时候，他只是在推销自己的名字和他创造的过着人们渴望的丰富生活方式的公众形象。</p><p> The awkward part… He could just hire talented people to handle the details for him!</p><p>尴尬的部分…。他可以雇佣有才华的人来为他处理细节！</p><p> There just aren’t many excuses to be made. The style of doing business just isn’t that of a real professional.</p><p>没有太多的借口可以找。做生意的风格不是真正的专业人士的风格。</p><p>  As we can see, the problem isn’t just with businesses. The kinds of business opportunities Trump University taught you to exploit exist in part because of the way that our government has set things up.</p><p>正如我们所看到的，问题不仅仅出在企业身上。特朗普大学(Trump University)教你利用的那种商机之所以存在，部分原因是我们的政府设置了这种方式。</p><p> There has been a lack of attention to detail, and a lack of appreciation for how the ways the laws are setup impact people’s lives. That casualness in doing things has a very long history.</p><p>人们缺乏对细节的关注，也缺乏对法律设置方式如何影响人们生活的理解。做事的随意性由来已久。</p><p> What at least some Republicans hoped for in Trump, was an effective businessman — an effective professional who really knows how to improve how things work.</p><p>至少一些共和党人希望特朗普是一个高效的商人-一个真正知道如何改善事情运作的高效专业人士。</p><p> Looking at Singapore for example, it went from 3rd world to 1st world in 30 years or so under Lee Kuan Yew’s leadership.</p><p>以新加坡为例，在李光耀的领导下，它在30年左右的时间里从第三世界发展到了第一世界。</p><p> One of Lee Kuan Yew’s key decisions was to make the public sector competitive with the private sector, in the war for talent. Because it’s worth it to have the best people working in government.</p><p>李光耀的关键决定之一是让公共部门在人才争夺战中与私营部门竞争。因为让最优秀的人在政府工作是值得的。</p><p>  Pre-COVID, the main things that Trump did with the economy were to reduce taxes without reducing government spending (and maybe reduce some regulations)</p><p>在COVID之前，特朗普对经济所做的主要事情是在不减少政府支出的情况下减税(可能还会减少一些监管)。</p><p> Which is like doing a large stimulus package — at a time when the economy was already doing well and when it had already been under stimulus for a long time.</p><p>这就像是在实施一项大规模刺激计划--此时经济已经表现良好，而且已经在刺激下运行了很长一段时间。</p><p> This is like taking out a large loan and carelessly throwing money over the place. Obviously, for a while that’ll make it look like things are going really well!</p><p>这就好比借了一大笔贷款，却不小心把钱扔得到处都是。显然，在一段时间内，这会让事情看起来非常顺利！</p><p>  Which means that once the extra money runs out, you’ll find that many of the investments that looked okay when you were flush with cash were in fact bad investments. And now you’re in even more debt than before.</p><p>这意味着，一旦多余的钱用完了，你会发现很多在你现金充裕的时候看起来还不错的投资实际上都是糟糕的投资。现在你的债务比以前更多了。</p><p>  This is not unlike what Trump has done with his own businesses. He started off with hundreds of millions of dollars from his dad — free and clear.</p><p>这与特朗普对自己企业的所作所为没有什么不同。一开始，他从父亲那里得到了数亿美元--清清楚楚地拿到了。</p><p> And now… He still has the appearance of affluence, but he’s taken on so much debt that he hasn’t used well that no respectable US bank is willing to lend him much more money.</p><p>现在是…。他仍然看起来很富有，但他背负了太多债务，以至于他没有好好利用，以至于没有一家受人尊敬的美国银行愿意借给他更多的钱。</p><p> Seriously… It’s not personal. You should build teams of good professionals, give them clear responsibilities — and then let them handle it!</p><p>严重的…。这不是私人恩怨。你应该组建一支优秀的专业团队，给他们明确的责任--然后让他们来处理！</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/bigger-picture/the-lessons-of-trump-university-d73cb10e2208">https://medium.com/bigger-picture/the-lessons-of-trump-university-d73cb10e2208</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/kind/">#kind</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/政府/">#政府</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
