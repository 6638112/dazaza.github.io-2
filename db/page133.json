", "note_en": "Kredivo is operated by Singapore-based fintech FinAccel. This is the largest loan facility it has raised so far, and is VPC\u2019s biggeast debt commitment to a fintech company outside of the United States and Europe, as well as its only investment in Southeast Asia. Kredivo will use the debt facility to help achieve its goal of serving 10 million customers in Indonesia.\n  Other notable startups that have received debt financing from VPC include  Razor Group,  factory 14,  Konfio and  Elevate.\n Kredivo has more than three million customers and offers two main types of lending products: zero interest 30-day \u2018buy now, pay later\u2019 financing for e-commerce and offline purchases, and three-, six- and 12-month installment loans with an interest rate of 2.6% a month, or a maximum annual rate of 53.36%. Kredivo chief executive officer Akshay Garg told TechCrunch that its \u2018buy now, pay later\u2019 services are typically used for small-value online purchases, while installment loans are used to finance bigger transactions, like laptops, home renovation or medical care.\n While \u2018buy now, pay later\u2019 services like Klarna, Afterpay or Affirm offer convenience to customers in the United States or Europe, in emerging markets it also serves as a tool to build credit, especially in countries that have low credit card penetration, Garg said.\n  \u201cCredit is one of the largest and most complex areas of the financial services ecosystem and the fact is that Indonesia is deeply underserved on that equation,\u201d he said. Most banks only provide secured lending, like home or car loans, and unsecured lending is rare. Garg said there are only eight million credit card holders in Indonesia, which has a population of 270.6 million, and that number has not changed in 13 years.\n One of the reasons for Indonesia\u2019s very low credit card penetration rate is because banks are reluctant to give unsecured loans, especially to younger customers.\n \u201cWhat we\u2019re solving is less a convenience problem and more an access problem. We\u2019re putting unsecured credit, or the ability to buy on credit, in the hands of urban millennials for the first time, simply because banks are just not providing them access to credit cards,\u201d said Garg.\n He added that Kredivo\u2019s effective risk-scoring model allows to charge low interest rates, and its non-performing loan ratio is in the low single-digits, despite the economic impact of COVID-19, which Garg described as a \u201ctrial by fire.\u201d\n Like credit cards from banks, Kredivo also reports customers\u2019 loan histories to Indonesia\u2019s credit bureaus, so they can build credit scores. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is a building Indonesia\u2019s first real digital credit bureau from the ground up, and I think our risk metrics show that this is not just for the sake of some funky innovation, but something that is delivering real performance,\u201d Garg said.\n In a statement, VPC partner Gordon Watson said, \u201cWe have been impressed with the resilience and growth of the business and look forward to deepening our partnership with Kredivo. The company presents a unique combination of growth, scale, risk management and financial inclusion in one of the most exciting emerging markets in the world.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-21 21:30:25", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8d44\u672c,pay,\u8d37\u6b3e", "title": "\u7acb\u5373\u8d2d\u4e70\uff0c\u4ed8\u6b3e\u540e\u6765\u542f\u52a8Kredivo\u5c06\u5176\u503a\u52a1\u5de5\u4e1a\u4ece\u80dc\u5229\u516c\u56ed\u8d44\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u5230200\u7c73 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tBuy now, pay later startup Kredivo doubles its debt facility from Victory Park Capital to $200M\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/buy-now-pay-later-startup-kredivo-doubles-its-debt-facility-from-victory-park-capital-to-200m/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8d44\u672c", "pay", "\u8d37\u6b3e"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "472d26730f32eb781b3bb259f60f8099.jpg", "infoid": 1067200, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u8bb8\u53ef\u97f3\u4e50\u4e3a\u5e7f\u544a\uff0c\u7535\u5f71\uff0c\u7535\u89c6\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u7b49\u7684\u9ad8\u8c03\u540d\u79f0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8fea\u58eb\u5c3c\uff0cNetflix\uff0cApple\uff0cCoca-Cola\uff0c\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u548c\u8c37\u6b4c\u3002\u5b83\u5bc4\u51fa\u6765\u81ea\u5927\u7ea660\u4e07\u97f3\u4e50\u5bb6/\u6b4c\u66f2\u624b\u673a/\u6743\u5229\u6301\u6709\u4eba\u7684\u6b4c\u66f2\u3002\n \u8be5\u670d\u52a1\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\uff0c\u8be5\u670d\u52a1\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6708\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u5b83\u5ba3\u5e03\u6536\u8d2d\u521b\u610f\u673a\u6784\u7684\u5361\u9a6c\u91cc\u7ef4\u65af\u3002\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e00\u5e74\u4e2d\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u6536\u8d2d\u5305\u62ecCuesongs\uff0cSong zu\uff0c\u6912\u76d0\u5377\u997c\u548c\u7a81\u53d1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002\n  \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u8d44\u91d1\u5c06\u8d70\u5411\u66f4\u591a\u7684M\uff06amp;\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u5168\u7403\u4eba\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u603b\u90e8\u4f4d\u4e8eL.A.\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u6b27\u6d32\u548c\u4e9a\u592a\u5730\u533a\u8bbe\u6709\u529e\u4e8b\u5904\u3002\n  \u201cSongtradr\u6b63\u5728\u8fc5\u901f\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u7ee7\u7eed\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5f00\u53d1\u6280\u672f\u7684B2B\u97f3\u4e50\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b0\u6536\u8d2d\uff0c\u201d\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98Paul Wiltshire\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u3002 \u201c\u5438\u5f15\u5982\u6b64\u56de\u5408\u7684\u8fd9\u7c7b\u84dd\u7b79\u80a1\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8d5e\u540c\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u8fc5\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u97f3\u4e50\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u613f\u666f\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u201d ", "note_en": "The platform licenses music to high profile names for advertising, films, TV, gaming and the like, including Disney, Netflix, Apple, Coca-Cola, Amazon and Google.

Other acquisitions made in the past year include Cuesongs, Song Zu, Pretzel and Tunefind.\n  The company says the new funding will go toward even more M&amp;As, new products and an increase in global headcount. The company is headquartered in L.A., but also has offices in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.\n  \u201cSongtradr is rapidly accelerating as we continue to develop our tech-enabled B2B music ecosystem and integrate our new acquisitions,\u201d CEO Paul Wiltshire said in a press release. \u201cAttracting such a blue-chip investor base into this round further endorses our vision of the future music industry in this rapidly evolving digital world, providing a strong foundation for the future.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-21 21:30:11", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name":

", "note_en": "This week twenty-five years ago, Quake broke new ground in game engine realism.It was one of the first commercial games to have fully texture mapped 3D scenesrendered in real-time, with pre-computed lightmaps adding an extra layer ofatmosphere.\n Still, the requirement that the game run in real time on meagre 1996 hardware,placed massive constraints on graphical realism. In this post I want to explorehow the game can be made to look better, with modern hardware and offlinerendering.\n I am going to talk about how I wrote a script for converting Quake demo filesinto Blender scenes.  Blender is a free and opensource 3D modelling and rendering application. Its renderer, Cycles, is apath tracer capable of producing photorealistic imagery, supporting featuressuch as motion blur, depth of field, a comprehensive shader system, and muchmore. By exporting to Blender we get to use all of these features for free,without having to write a new renderer. My objective is to use the originalgame assets as much as possible, while relying on Blender\u2019s accurate lightingsimulation to improve realism.\n Throughout this post I will be linking to the source code, which is part of my pyquake repository. If you want tohave a go at importing your own demos into Blender, I have put together some instructions,but I probably won\u2019t respond to any issues or PRs.I encourage you to make a fork if you are interested in maintaining this project.\n   A demo file is a compact recording of a Quake game, for the purposes of sharingwith other players, or for personal review. Being a multiplayer game, the gameis split into client and server components. The demo is essentially a recordingof the traffic that goes from server to client during the game. Given a demo,and an installation of Quake, it is then possible to reproduce exactly what theplayer saw at the time of recording:\n  Note that even in single player mode, there are still client and servercomponents in the code, with the network layer replaced by a simple memorytransfer, which means demos can be recorded in this setting too.\n Since the demo file format is closely related to the Quake protocol, it can beunderstood by reading the appropriate layer of Quake\u2019s networking code. It isthen relatively straightforward, if a little laborious, to write a parser forthe demo file format in Python.\n When parsed, the demo file can be read a little like a script for a play.

This gives the geometry and textureinformation for the level, along with some other data structures which we willcome onto later. The file format is well documentedand, with a little effort, can be parsed into Python classes. Similarly, themodels which represent things like monsters, weapon models and so on, aredefined in .mdl files, which is also well documented.This project doesn\u2019t handle sound (for the video at the top I simply dubbed arecording from the game), so there is no need to parse sound assets.\n    Blender has a rich Python scripting interface. In fact, Blender\u2019s GUI works byinteracting with a Python API, and so anything that can be done through the UIcan also be scripted. Using this Python interface, I made a script to importthe .bsp files and models parsed above into Blender. For most of the concepts inthe Quake assets there are direct analogues in Blender:\n  My code for importing the parsed .mdl and .bsp files into Blender is here (.mdl)and  here (.bsp).\n Importing the parsed demo consists of reading the intro section to tell us whichgame assets (models and map) to convert into Blender assets, and then animatingthem according to the baseline / update sections. I make use of Blender\u2019sanimation support to do this. More specifically, I insert position,orientation, and shape-key keyframes for every  ServerMessageUpdate command inthe parsed demo. I also keyframe animated shaders such as warping water so thatthey move according to the current game time. Below is a recording showing theresult of importing a demo from the first level in the game. My code forimporting demos files into Blender can be found here.\n   At this point we have our geometry loaded and animated, with some texturesapplied. Still, we are missing light sources. When the Quake levels weredesigned, lights were defined as point light sources scattered throughout thelevel. A compilation process then converts these point light sources into lightmaps. This process works by assigning a low resolution texture to each surfacein the level, and calculating how much each  texel is directlyilluminated by these point light sources. Since this process on\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-21 21:22:43", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8def\u5f84,tracing,\u6e38\u620f", "title": "\u5728\u6405\u62cc\u5668\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5730\u9707 ", "title_en": "Path Tracing Quake in Blender", "transed": 1, "url": "http://matthewearl.github.io/2021/06/20/quake-blender/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8def\u5f84", "tracing", "\u6e38\u620f"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067198, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u5730\u5740\u548c/\u6216\u5bc6\u7801\u4e0e\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u8bf7\u68c0\u67e5\u5e76\u518d\u6b21\u5c1d\u8bd5\u3002  \u767b\u5f55\u5931\u8d25\u3002 \u8bf7\u68c0\u67e5\u60a8\u4ece\u5217\u8868\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\uff0c\u5e76\u8f93\u5165\u60a8\u7528\u4e8e\u767b\u5f55\u60a8\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u7528\u6237\u540d\u548c\u5bc6\u7801\u3002  \u4e00\u4e9b\u793e\u4f1a\u671f\u520a\u8981\u6c42\u60a8\u521b\u5efa\u4e2a\u4eba\u8d44\u6599\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u60a8\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5e10\u6237 ", "note_en": "The email address and/or password entered does not match our records, please check and try again.\n  Login failed.
