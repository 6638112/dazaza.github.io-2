A short story about our dreams of technology.     Mercifully, the whole thing is starting to fade, to become an episode. When I do still catch the odd glimpse, it’s peripheral; mere fragments of mad-doctor chrome, confining themselves to the corner of the eye. There was that flying-wing liner over San Francisco last week, but it was almost translucent. And the shark-fin roadsters have gotten scarcer, and freeways discreetly avoid unfolding themselves into the gleaming eighty-lane monsters I was forced to drive last month in my rented Toyota. And I know that none of it will follow me to New York; my vision is narrowing to a single wavelength of probability. I’ve worked hard for that. Television helped a lot.</p><p>如果五十年前的那些未来前景在今天实现，您会感觉如何？关于我们的技术梦想的简短故事。幸运的是，整个事情开始消退，成为一集。当我仍然瞥见奇怪的一面时，它就是外围设备。只是疯狂的医生Chrome的片段，将自己限制在眼角。上周在旧金山上空有那架飞翼客机，但它几乎是半透明的。鱼翅跑车变得越来越稀少，高速公路谨慎地避免陷入我上个月在我租来的丰田车中被强迫驾驶的闪闪发光的八车道怪物中。而且我知道，没有什么人会跟随我到纽约。我的视野正在缩小到一个单一的可能性范围。我为此而努力。电视帮助很大。</p><p> I suppose it started in London, in that bogus Greek taverna in Battersea Park Road, with lunch on Cohen’s corporate tab. Dead steam-table food and it took them thirty minutes to find an ice bucket for the retsina. Cohen works for Barris-Watford, who publish big, trendy “trade” paperbacks: illustrated histories of the neon sign, the pinball machine, the windup toys of Occupied Japan. I’d gone over to shoot a series of shoe ads; California girls with tanned legs and frisky Day-Glo jogging shoes had capered for me down the escalators of St. John’s Wood and across the platforms of Tooting Bec. A lean and hungry young agency had decided that the mystery of London Transport would sell waffle-tread nylon runners. They decide; I shoot. And Cohen, whom I knew vaguely from the old days in New York, had invited me to lunch the day before I was due out of Heathrow. He brought along a very fashionably dressed young woman named Dialta Downes, who was virtually chinless and evidently a noted pop-art historian. In retrospect, I see her walking in beside Cohen under a floating neon sign that flashes  THIS WAY LIES MADNESS in huge sans-serif capitals.</p><p> 我想它始于伦敦，在巴特西公园路那座虚假的希腊小酒馆里，在科恩的公司菜单上吃午餐。蒸汽桌上已经死了，他们花了三十分钟才找到一个冰桶给retsina。科恩为Barris-Watford工作，后者出版了大而时尚的“贸易”平装本：插图说明了霓虹灯的历史，弹球机，被占领日本的发条玩具。我去拍摄了一系列的鞋子广告；加州女孩晒黑的双腿和活泼的Day-Glo慢跑鞋已经在圣约翰伍德（St. John’s Wood）的自动扶梯和Tooting Bec的平台上向我倾斜。一个瘦弱而饥饿的年轻代理商决定，伦敦运输公司的奥秘将出售华夫饼干胎的尼龙跑步者。他们决定;我开枪我从纽约的旧时起就隐约认识了科恩，他邀请我去希思罗机场前一天吃午饭。他带了一个穿着时尚的年轻女士叫迪亚塔·唐斯（Dialta Downes），她实际上是下巴的，显然是著名的波普艺术史学家。回想起来，我看到她在一个漂浮的霓虹灯下在科恩旁边走过，霓虹灯在巨大的无衬线大写字母中闪烁着“这种方式的谎言”。</p><p> Cohen introduced us and explained that Dialta was the prime mover behind the latest Barris-Watford project, an illustrated history of what she called “American Streamlined Moderne.” Cohen called it “raygun Gothic.” Their working title was  The Airstream Futuropolis: The Tomorrow That Never Was.</p><p> 科恩向我们作了介绍，并解释说迪亚塔是最新的巴里斯-沃特福德（Barris-Watford）项目的原动力，这是她所谓的“美国精简现代艺术”的历史说明。科恩将其称为“哥特式射线枪”。他们的工作头衔是《气流未来之城：从未有过的明天》。</p><p> There’s a British obsession with the more baroque elements of American pop culture, something like the weird cowboys-and-Indians fetish of the West Germans or the aberrant French hunger for old Jerry Lewis films. In Dialta Downes this manifested itself in a mania for a uniquely American form of architecture that most Americans are scarcely aware of. At first I wasn’t sure what she was talking about, but gradually it began to dawn on me. I found myself remembering Sunday morning television in the Fifties.</p><p> 英国人痴迷于美国流行文化中更多的巴洛克式元素，例如西德人奇怪的牛仔和印度人的恋物癖或对杰里·刘易斯老电影的法国饥渴。在Dialta Downes中，这表现为一种对大多数美国人几乎不了解的独特的美国建筑形式的狂热。刚开始我不确定她在说什么，但是渐渐地我开始意识到。我发现自己想起了《五十年代》周日早上的电视。</p><p> Sometimes they’d run old eroded newsreels as filler on the local station. You’d sit there with a peanut butter sandwich and a glass of milk, and a static-ridden Hollywood baritone would tell you that there was A Flying Car in Your Future. And three Detroit engineers would putter around with this big old Nash with wings, and you’d see it rumbling furiously down some deserted Michigan runway. You never actually saw it take off, but it flew away to Dialta Downes’s never-never land, true home of a generation of completely uninhibited technophiles. She was talking about those odds and ends of “futuristic” Thirties and Forties architecture you pass daily in American cities without noticing: the movie marquees ribbed to radiate some mysterious energy, the dime stores faced with fluted aluminum, the chrome-tube chairs gathering dust in the lobbies of transient hotels. She saw these things as segments of a dreamworld, abandoned in the uncaring present; she wanted me to photograph them for her.</p><p> 有时，他们会在本地电视台上播放旧的腐蚀新闻纸作为填充。您会坐在那里，那里有花生酱三明治和一杯牛奶，而饱经风霜的好莱坞男中音会告诉您，未来有一辆飞行汽车。底特律的三名工程师会带着那只带翅膀的老式纳什（Nash）轻推一下，您会发现它在密西根州一条空无一人的跑道上狂轰乱撞。您从未真正看到过它的腾飞，但它飞到了Dialta Downes从未有过的土地上，这是一代完全不受约束的技术爱好者的真正故乡。她谈论的是美国城市中每天都经过的“未来派”三十年代和四十年代建筑的奇异之处：电影的天幕肋骨散发出一些神秘的能量，一角硬币商店面对着铝制的凹槽，铬管椅上聚集着灰尘在临时酒店的大厅里。她把这些东西当作梦境的一部分，抛弃在无情的当下。她要我为她照相。</p><p> The Thirties had seen the first generation of American industrial designers; until the Thirties, all pencil sharpeners had looked like pencil sharpeners—your basic Victorian mechanism, perhaps with a curlicue of decorative trim. After the advent of the designers, some pencil sharpeners looked as though they’d been put together in wind tunnels. For the most part, the change was only skin-deep; under the streamlined chrome shell, you’d find the same Victorian mechanism. Which made a certain kind of sense, because the most successful American designers had been recruited from the ranks of Broadway theater designers. It was all a stage set, a series of elaborate props for playing at living in the future.</p><p> 三十年代出现了第一代美国工业设计师。直到三十年代，所有的卷笔刀看起来都像卷笔刀一样，这是您基本的维多利亚时代机制，也许带有装饰性的装饰。设计师出现后，一些削笔刀看起来好像是在风洞中拼在一起的。在大多数情况下，这种变化只是肤浅的。在简化的镀铬外壳下，您会找到相同的维多利亚时代机制。这具有某种意义，因为最成功的美国设计师是从百老汇剧院设计师中招募的。这一切都是舞台，是一系列未来生活中精心制作的道具。</p><p> Over coffee, Cohen produced a fat manila envelope full of glossies. I saw the winged statues that guard the Hoover Dam, forty-foot concrete hood ornaments leaning steadfastly into an imaginary hurricane. I saw a dozen shots of Frank Lloyd Wright’s Johnson Wax Building, juxtaposed with the covers of old  Amazing Stories pulps, by an artist named Frank R. Paul; the employees of Johnson Wax must have felt as though they were walking into one of Paul’s spray-paint pulp Utopias. Wright’s building looked as though it had been designed for people who wore white togas and Lucite sandals. I hesitated over one sketch of a particularly grandiose prop-driven airliner, all wing, like a fat, symmetrical boomerang with windows in unlikely places. Labeled arrows indicated the locations of the grand ballroom and two squash courts. It was dated 1936.</p><p> 喝咖啡时，科恩制作了一个充满光泽的胖马尼拉信封。我看到有翼的雕像守护着胡佛水坝，四十英尺的混凝土引擎盖装饰物坚定地倾斜在假想的飓风中。我看到了弗兰克·劳埃德·赖特（Frank Lloyd Wright）的约翰逊·蜡像馆（Johnson Wax Building）的十几张照片，上面是名叫弗兰克·R·保罗（Frank R. Paul）的艺术家的旧奇妙纸浆的覆盖物。 Johnson Wax的员工一定感到好像走进了Paul的喷浆纸浆乌托邦中。赖特（Wright）的建筑物看起来好像是为穿着白色长袍和Lucite凉鞋的人设计的。我犹豫了一幅特别宏伟的道具驱动的客机的草图，它的所有机翼都像胖胖的对称回旋镖，在不太可能的地方带有窗户。标有箭头的箭头指示大宴会厅和两个壁球场的位置。它的日期为1936年。</p><p> “This thing couldn’t have flown … ?” I looked at Dialta Downes.</p><p>“这东西不可能飞过……？”我看着Dialta Downes。</p><p> “Oh, no, quite impossible, even with those twelve giant props; but they loved the look, don’t you see? New York to London in less than two days, first-class dining rooms, private cabins, sun decks, dancing to jazz in the evening … The designers were populists, you see; they were trying to give the public what it wanted. What the public wanted was the future.”</p><p> “哦，不，即使有那十二个巨型道具，这也是完全不可能的；但他们喜欢这种外观，您不知道吗？在不到两天的时间里，纽约到伦敦就设有一流的饭厅，私人小木屋，日光浴平台，并在晚上跳爵士舞。他们试图向公众提供想要的东西。公众想要的是未来。”</p><p> I’d been in Burbank for three days, trying to suffuse a really dull-looking rocker with charisma, when I got the package from Cohen. It is possible to photograph what isn’t there; it’s damned hard to do, and consequently a very marketable talent. While I’m not bad at it, I’m not exactly the best, either, and this poor guy strained my Nikon’s credibility. I got out depressed because I do like to do a good job, but not totally depressed, because I did make sure I’d gotten the check for the job, and I decided to restore myself with the sublime artiness of the Barris-Watford assignment. Cohen had sent me some books on Thirties design, more photos of streamlined buildings, and a list of Dialta Downes’s fifty favorite examples of the style in California.</p><p> 当我从科恩（Cohen）那里拿到包裹时，我已经在伯班克（Burbank）待了三天，试图用魅力来让一个看起来很呆板的摇滚歌手感到惊讶。可以拍摄不存在的东西；这太难了，因此很有才华。虽然我并不擅长，但我也不是最出色的人，这个可怜的家伙使我的尼康信誉大打折扣。我感到沮丧是因为我喜欢做好工作，但并没有完全沮丧，因为我确实确保得到这份工作的支票，所以我决定以Barris-Watford职位的高超技巧来恢复自我。科恩给我寄来了一些有关三十年代设计的书，更多流线型建筑物的照片，以及迪亚塔·唐斯（Dalta Downes）在加利福尼亚州最喜欢的五十种风格的清单。</p><p> Architectural photography can involve a lot of waiting; the building becomes a kind of sundial, while you wait for a shadow to crawl away from a detail you want, or for the mass and balance of the structure to reveal itself in a certain way. While I was waiting, I thought of myself in Dialta Downes’s America. When 1 isolated a few of the factory buildings on the ground glass of the Hasselblad, they came across with a kind of sinister totalitarian dignity, like the stadiums Albert Speer built for Hitler. But the rest of it was relentlessly tacky; ephemeral stuff extruded by the collective American subconscious of the Thirties, tending mostly to survive along depressing strips lined with dusty motels, mattress wholesalers, and small used-car lots. I went for the gas stations in a big way.</p><p> 建筑摄影可能需要大量等待。当您等待阴影从所需的细节中爬出，或者等待结构的质量和平衡性以某种方式展现出来时，建筑物就变成了日d。在等待的时候，我想到了Dialta Downes的America。当1在哈苏（Hasselblad）的毛玻璃上隔离一些工厂建筑物时，它们遇到了一种险恶的极权主义尊严，例如阿尔伯特·斯佩尔（Albert Speer）为希特勒建造的体育场。但是其余的内容都是无情的。短暂的东西是由三十年代的美国集体潜意识所挤出的，大部分生活在沿着布满尘土的汽车旅馆，床垫批发商和小型二手车的令人压抑的地带上。我去了很多加油站。</p><p> During the high point of the Downes Age, they put Ming the Merciless in charge of designing California gas stations. Favoring the architecture of his native Mongo, he cruised up and down the coast erecting raygun emplacements in white stucco. Lots of them featured superfluous central towers ringed with those strange radiator flanges that were a signature motif of the style and which made them look as though they might generate potent bursts of raw technological enthusiasm if you could only find the switch that turned them on. I shot one in San Jose an hour before the bulldozers arrived and drove right through the structural truth of plaster and lathing and cheap concrete.</p><p> 在唐斯时代的高峰期，他们让无情的明（Ming the Merciless）负责加利福尼亚加油站的设计。他喜欢他的祖国蒙哥（Mongo）的建筑，在海岸上空游荡，在白色灰泥上架设了雷贡炮台。它们中的许多都带有多余的中央塔架，这些塔架上挂着奇怪的散热器法兰，这是该风格的标志性主题，如果您只找到打开它们的开关，就好像它们可能会产生强大的原始技术热情。在推土机抵达前一个小时，我在圣何塞开了一枪，开车驶过石膏，板条和廉价混凝土的结构真相。</p><p> “Think of it,” Dialta Downes had said, “as a kind of alternate America: a 1980 that never happened. An architecture of broken dreams.”</p><p> “想想，”迪亚塔·唐斯说，“作为一种替代美国：1980年从未发生过。破碎的梦的建筑。”</p><p>  And that was my frame of mind as I made the stations of her convoluted socioarchitectural cross in my red Toyota—as I gradually tuned in to her image of a shadowy America-that-wasn’t, of Coca-Cola plants like beached submarines, and fifth-run movie houses like the temples of some lost sect that had worshiped blue mirrors and geometry. And as I moved among these secret ruins, I found myself wondering what the inhabitants of that lost future would think of the world I lived in. The Thirties dreamed white marble and slipstream chrome, immortal crystal and burnished bronze, but the rockets on the covers of the Gernsback pulps had fallen on London in the dead of night, screaming. After the war, everyone had a car—no wings for it—and the promised superhighway to drive it down, so that the sky itself darkened, and the fumes ate the marble and pitted the miracle crystal. …</p><p>  这就是我的心态，因为我在红色的丰田车上摆弄了她那复杂的社会建筑交叉点，后来我逐渐了解了她那阴暗的美国的形象，可口可乐的植物就像是沙滩潜水艇，还有第五家经营的电影院，例如一些曾经崇拜过蓝色镜面和几何形状的失落宗派的庙宇。当我在这些秘密废墟中穿行时，我发现自己想知道那个失落的未来的居民会如何看待我所生活的世界。三十年代梦dream以求的白色大理石和滑流镀铬，不朽的水晶和抛光的青铜，但是火箭被掩盖了深夜，许多Gernsback纸浆掉落在伦敦，尖叫着。战争结束后，每个人都拥有一辆没有翼的汽车，以及承诺的高速公路将其压低，以至于天空本身一片漆黑，烟雾吞噬了大理石，使奇迹般的水晶落入坑中。 …</p><p> And one day, on the outskirts of Bolinas, when I was setting up to shoot a particularly lavish example of Ming’s martial architecture, I penetrated a fine membrane, a membrane of probability. …</p><p>有一天，在玻利纳斯的郊区，当我准备拍摄一幅有关明式武术建筑的特别奢华的例子时，我穿透了一层细密的膜，即一种可能性的膜。 …</p><p>  And looked up to see a twelve-engined thing like a bloated boomerang, all wing, thrumming its way east with an elephantine grace, so low that I could count the rivets in its dull silver skin, and hear—maybe—the echo of jazz.</p><p>  抬头看去，看到一个十二引擎的东西，像一个肿的回旋镖，全翼，以大象般的风度向东猛冲，如此之低，以至于我可以数出沉闷的银色皮肤中的铆钉，并听到（也许）爵士乐的回声。</p><p> I took it to Kihn. Merv Kihn, free-lance journalist with an extensive line in Texas pterodactyls, redneck UFO contactees, bush-league Loch Ness monsters, and the Top Ten conspiracy theories in the loonier reaches of the American mass mind.</p><p> 我把它带到基恩。自由记者梅尔夫·基恩（Merv Kihn）在得克萨斯州的翼手龙，乡下人的不明飞行物联系人，丛林同盟的尼斯湖怪兽以及在美国大众头脑更懒散的十大阴谋论中有广泛的专栏。</p><p> “It’s good,” said Kihn, polishing his yellow Polaroid shooting glasses on the hem of his Hawaiian shirt, “but it’s not  mental; lacks the true quill.”</p><p> 基恩说：“很好，”他在夏威夷衬衫的下摆上擦了黄色的宝丽来射击眼镜，“但这不是精神问题；缺乏真正的羽毛笔。”</p><p> “But I saw it, Mervyn.” We were seated poolside in brilliant Arizona sunlight. He was in Tucson waiting for a group of retired Las Vegas civil servants whose leader received messages from Them on her microwave oven. I’d driven all night and was feeling it.</p><p> “但是我看到了，默文。”我们坐在亚利桑那州灿烂的阳光下的池畔。他在图森（Tucson）等待一群退休的拉斯维加斯公务员，他们的领导在微波炉上收到了他们的消息。我整晚开车，一直感觉到。</p><p> “Of course you did. Of course you saw it. You’ve read my stuff; haven’t you grasped my blanket solution to the UFO problem? It’s simple, plain and country simple: people”—he settled the glasses carefully on his long hawk nose and fixed me with his best basilisk glare—“ see … things. People see these things. Nothing’s there, but people  see them anyway. Because they need to, probably. You’ve read Jung, you should know the score. … In your case, it’s so obvious: You admit you were thinking about this crackpot architecture, having fantasies. … Look, I’m sure you’ve taken your share of drugs, right? How many people survived the Sixties in California without having the odd hallucination? All those nights when you discovered that whole armies of Disney technicians had been employed to weave animated holograms of Egyptian hieroglyphs into the fabric of your jeans, say, or the times when—”</p><p> “当然可以。你当然看到了您已经阅读了我的东西；您是否掌握了我对UFO问题的全面解决方案？简单，朴素和乡村风格：人们”，他将眼镜小心地放在长鹰的鼻子上，并用最好的蛇怪眩光固定在我身上，“”……见到。人们看到这些东西。那里什么都没有，但是人们仍然可以看到它们。因为他们需要，也许。您已经读过荣格，您应该知道分数。 ……就您而言，这是如此明显：您承认您正在考虑这种幻想的构架，充满幻想。 …看，我确定您已经服用了一部分毒品，对吗？有多少人在六十年代的加利福尼亚幸存下来而没有发生奇怪的幻觉？当您发现迪斯尼技术人员的全部人员都被雇用将埃及象形文字的动画全息图编织到牛仔裤的布料中时，或者说是在什么时候-</p><p>  “Of course not. It wasn’t like that at all; it was ‘in a setting of clear reality,’ right? Everything normal, and then there’s the monster, the mandala, the neon cigar. In your case, a giant Tom Swift airplane. It happens  all the time. You aren’t even crazy. You know that, don’t you?” He fished a beer out of the battered foam cooler beside his deck chair.</p><p>  “当然不是。根本不是那样；那是“在一个清晰的现实中”，对吧？一切正常，然后是怪物，曼陀罗和霓虹雪茄。就您而言，是一架巨大的汤姆·斯威夫特飞机。它一直在发生。你甚至都不疯狂。你知道吗？”他从甲板椅旁受虐的泡沫冷却器中捞出啤酒。</p><p> “Last week I was in Virginia. Grayson County. I interviewed a sixteen-year-old girl who’d been assaulted by a  bar hade.”</p><p>“上周我在弗吉尼亚州。格雷森县。我采访了一个16岁的女孩，她被一家酒吧的哈德袭击。”</p><p>  “A bear head. The severed head of a bear. This  bar hade, see, was floating around on its own little flying saucer, looked kind of like the hubcaps on cousin Wayne’s vintage Caddy. Had red, glowing eyes like two cigar stubs and telescoping chrome antennas poking up behind its ears.” He burped.</p><p>  “熊头。被切断的熊头。看到，这条酒吧的烛台漂浮在它自己的小飞碟上，看上去有点像表弟韦恩（Wayne）的老式球童上的轮毂盖。红色的发光的眼睛像两个雪茄短棒，可伸缩的镀铬天线在耳朵后面刺破。”他打。</p><p>  “You don’t want to know; you’re obviously impressionable. ‘It was cold’”—he lapsed into his bad Southern accent—“‘and metallic.’ It made electronic noises. Now that is the real thing, the straight goods from the mass unconscious, friend; that little girl is a witch. There’s no place for her to function in this society. She’d have seen the devil if she hadn’t been brought up on The Bionic Woman’ and all those ‘Star Trek’ reruns. She is clued into the main vein. And she knows that it happened to her. I got out ten minutes before the heavy UFO boys showed up with the polygraph.”</p><p>  “你不想知道；您显然印象深刻。 “很冷”-他陷入了南方的不良口音-“和金属味。”它发出了电子噪音。现在是真实的东西，来自群众潜意识，朋友的直接物品；那个小女孩是个女巫。她在这个社会上无处可去。如果她不是在《仿生女人》中长大的，她就会看到魔鬼，而所有“星际迷航”都将重播。她陷入了主静脉。她知道这发生在她身上。在十足的不明飞行物男孩出现在测谎仪上之前，我走了十分钟。”</p><p> I must have looked pained, because he set his beer down carefully beside the cooler and sat up.</p><p> 我一定看起来很痛苦，因为他把啤酒小心地放到冷藏柜旁边坐了起来。</p><p> “If you want a classier explanation, I’d say you saw a semiotic ghost. All these contactée stories, for instance, are framed in a kind of sci-fi imagery that permeates our culture. I could buy aliens, but not aliens that look like Fifties’ comic art. They’re semiotic phantoms, bits of deep cultural imagery that have split off and taken on a life of their own, like the Jules Verne airships that those old Kansas farmers were always seeing. But you saw a different kind of ghost, that’s all. That plane was part of the mass unconscious, once. You picked up on that, somehow. The important thing is not to worry about it.”</p><p> “如果您想获得更经典的解释，我想您是看到了一个符号幽灵。例如，所有这些接触者故事都以一种贯穿我们文化的科幻影像为框架。我可以购买外星人，但不能购买看起来像五十年代漫画艺术的外星人。它们是符号符号的幻影，是一些深远的文化意象，它们已经分裂并呈现出自己的生命，例如堪萨斯州老农民经常看到的儒勒·凡尔纳飞艇。但是，您看到了另一种鬼魂，仅此而已。那架飞机曾经是大众无意识的一部分。您以某种方式对此有所了解。重要的是不要为此担心。”</p><p>  Kihn combed his thinning blond hair and went off to hear what They had had to say over the radar range lately, and I drew the curtains in my room and lay down in air-conditioned darkness to worry about it. I was still worrying about it when I woke up. Kihn had left a note on my door; he was flying up north in a chartered plane to check out a cattle-mutilation rumor (“muties,” he called them; another of his journalistic specialties).</p><p>  基恩梳理着他稀疏的金发，最近去听了他们在雷达范围内不得不说的话，我在房间里拉上窗帘，躺在有空调的黑暗中，为此担心。我醒来时仍在担心。基恩在我的门上留下了一张纸条。他正乘包机在北方飞行，以查明一个关于残割牛的谣言（他称呼“杂物”；这是他的另一个新闻专业）。</p><p>  I had a meal, showered, took a crumbling diet pill that had been kicking around in the bottom of my shaving kit for three years, and headed back to Los Angeles.</p><p>  我吃了一顿饭，洗完了澡，吃了一个粉碎性的减肥药，该药在我的剃须用品盒的底部已经踢了三年，然后回到了洛杉矶。</p><p> The speed limited my vision to the tunnel of the Toyota’s headlights. The body could drive, I told myself, while the mind maintained. Maintained and stayed away from the weird peripheral window dressing of amphetamine and exhaustion, the spectral, luminous vegetation that grows out of the corners of the mind’s eye along late-night highways. But the mind had its own ideas, and Kihn’s opinion of what 1 was already thinking of as my “sighting” rattled endlessly through my head in a tight, lopsided orbit. Semiotic ghosts. Fragments of the Mass Dream, whirling past in the wind of my passage. Somehow this feedback-loop aggravated the diet pill, and the speed-vegetation along the road began to assume the colors of infrared satellite images, glowing shreds blown apart in the Toyota’s slipstream.</p><p>速度限制了我对丰田大灯通道的视野。我告诉自己，在保持思想的同时，身体可以驱动。保持并远离苯丙胺和精疲力竭的怪异外围窗户装饰，光谱和发光的植物沿着深夜的高速公路从人眼的角落生长出来。但是头脑有自己的想法，基恩对1的看法已经成为我的“视力”，它在我那头狭窄而倾斜的轨道上无休止地摇动着。符号鬼。大众梦的碎片，在我穿越的风中旋转过去。这种反馈回路不知何故使减肥药加重了，沿路的速度植被开始呈现出红外卫星图像的颜色，在丰田的支流中吹散着发光的碎片。</p><p> I pulled over, then, and a half-dozen aluminum beer cans winked goodnight as I killed the headlights. I wondered what time it was in London, and tried to imagine Dialta Downes having breakfast in her Hampstead flat, surrounded by streamlined chrome figurines and books on American culture.</p><p> 然后我停了下来，当我杀死前灯时，有六个铝制啤酒罐在晚安中眨了眨眼。我想知道伦敦现在几点钟，想像一下迪亚塔·唐斯在她的汉普斯特德公寓里吃早餐，周围是流线型的镀铬小雕像和有关美国文化的书籍。</p><p> Desert nights in that country are enormous; the moon is closer. I watched the moon for a long time and decided that Kihn was right. The main thing was not to worry. All across the continent, daily, people who were more normal than I’d ever aspired to be saw giant birds, Bigfeet, flying oil refineries; they kept Kihn busy and solvent. Why should I be upset by a glimpse of the 1930s pop imagination loose over Bolinas? I decided to go to sleep, with nothing worse to worry about than rattlesnakes and cannibal hippies, safe amid the friendly roadside garbage of my own familiar continuum. In the morning I’d drive down to Nogales and photograph the old brothels, something I’d intended to do for years. The diet pill had given up.</p><p> 在那个国家，沙漠之夜是巨大的。月亮更近了。我看了很长时间的月亮，并确定基恩是对的。最主要的是不用担心。在整个非洲大陆，每天都有比我更渴望见到正常人的人们看到巨型鸟类，Bigfeet和飞行中的炼油厂；他们让基恩忙碌而有偿债能力。为何一瞥1930年代波利纳斯上空的流行想象就感到不安？我决定去睡觉，没有什么比响尾蛇和食人嬉皮士更担心的了，在我自己熟悉的连续体的友好路边垃圾中安全无虞。早上，我开车去诺加莱斯（Nogales）照相，并把老妓院照相，这是我多年来打算做的事情。减肥药已放弃。</p><p> The light woke me, and then the voices. The light came from somewhere behind me and threw shifting shadows inside the car. The voices were calm, indistinct, male and female, engaged in conversation.</p><p> 灯光唤醒了我，然后是声音。光线从我身后的某个地方发出，并在车内投下了不断变化的阴影。声音平淡，含糊不清，男女双方都在交谈。</p><p> My neck was stiff and my eyeballs felt gritty in their sockets. My leg had gone to sleep, pressed against the steering wheel. I fumbled for my glasses in the pocket of my work shirt and finally got them on.</p><p> 我的脖子僵硬，眼球在窝里坚韧不拔。我的腿睡着了，压在方向盘上。我在工作衬衫的口袋里摸索着眼镜，终于戴上了。</p><p>  The books on Thirties design were in the trunk; one of them contained sketches of an idealized city that drew on  Metropolis and  Things to Come, but squared everything, soaring up through an architect’s perfect clouds to zeppelin docks and mad neon spires. That city was a scale model of the one that rose behind me. Spire stood on spire in gleaming ziggurat steps that climbed to a central golden temple tower ringed with the crazy radiator flanges of the Mongo gas stations. You could hide the Empire State Building in the smallest of those towers. Roads of crystal soared between the spires, crossed and recrossed by smooth silver shapes like beads of running mercury. The air was thick with ships: giant wing-liners, little darting silver things (sometimes one of the quicksilver shapes from the sky bridges rose gracefully into the air and flew up to join the dance), mile-long blimps, hovering dragonfly things that were gyrocopters …</p><p>  三十年代设计的书在后备箱里。其中一张包含一个理想化城市的草图，该城市借鉴了《大都市》和《未来事物》，但将所有东西摆平，通过建筑师的完美云层飞向齐柏林飞艇码头和疯狂的霓虹灯尖顶。那个城市是我身后的城市的比例模型。尖塔耸立在尖顶上，闪闪发光的锯齿形台阶，爬到中央的金色圣殿塔上，上面耸立着Mongo加油站的疯狂散热器法兰。您可以将帝国大厦隐藏在其中最小的塔中。尖顶之间的水晶之路so绕，被光滑的银色形状（如流淌的水银珠）穿过和重新穿过。船上空气弥漫：巨大的机翼衬里，银色的飞镖小东西（有时天桥上的一种流银形状优雅地升到空中，飞起来参加舞蹈），一英里长的飞艇，盘旋着蜻蜓的东西，是旋翼机……</p><p> I closed my eyes tight and swung around in the seat. When I opened them, I willed myself to see the mileage meter, the pale road dust on the black plastic dashboard, the overflowing ashtray.</p><p> 我闭上眼睛，在座位上转来转去。当我打开它们时，我希望自己能看到里程表，黑色塑料仪表板上的白色道路灰尘，满是烟灰缸。</p><p> “Amphetamine psychosis,” I said. I opened my eyes. The dash was still there, the dust, the crushed filter tips. Very carefully, without moving my head, I turned the headlights on.</p><p>“安非他命精神病，”我说。我睁开眼睛。破折号仍在那儿，灰尘，破碎的过滤嘴。非常小心，没有动我的头，我打开了大灯。</p><p>  They were blond. They were standing beside their car, an aluminum avocado with a central shark-fin rudder jutting up from its spine and smooth black tires like a child’s toy. He had his arm around her waist and was gesturing toward the city. They were both in white: loose clothing, bare legs, spotless white sun shoes. Neither of them seemed aware of the beams of my headlights. He was saying something wise and strong, and she was nodding, and suddenly I was frightened, frightened in an entirely different way. Sanity had ceased to be an issue; I knew, somehow, that the city behind me was Tucson—a dream Tucson thrown up out of the collective yearning of an era. That it was real, entirely real. But the couple in front of me lived in it, and they frightened me.</p><p>  他们是金发。他们站在汽车旁边，一个铝制的鳄梨，中央的鲨鱼鳍舵从其脊柱突出，光滑的黑色轮胎像一个孩子的玩具。他的胳膊缠在她的腰上，正在向这座城市打手势。他们俩都是白色的：宽松的衣服，裸露的腿，一尘不染的白色太阳鞋。他们俩似乎都没有意识到我的头灯光束。他在说些明智而有力的话，她在点头，突然我被吓坏了，以一种完全不同的方式被吓坏了。理智不再是一个问题；我知道，以某种方式，我身后的城市是图森，这是一个时代的集体向往抛出的图森梦想。那是真实的，完全真实的。但是我面前的那对夫妇住在里面，他们吓坏了我。</p><p> They were the children of Dialta Downes’s ’80-that-wasn’t; they were Heirs to the Dream. They were white, blond, and they probably had blue eyes. They were American. Dialta had said that the Future had come to America first, but had finally passed it by. But not here, in the heart of the Dream. Here, we’d gone on and on, in a dream logic that knew nothing of pollution, the finite bounds of fossil fuel, or foreign wars it was possible to lose. They were smug, happy, and utterly content with themselves and their world. And in the Dream, it was  their world.</p><p> 他们是迪亚塔·唐斯（Dialta Downes）80岁那年的孩子；他们是梦想的继承人。他们是白人，金发碧眼，也许有蓝眼睛。他们是美国人。迪亚塔曾说，未来首先来到了美国，但终于过去了。但不是在梦中。在这里，我们以一种梦logic以求的方式不断前进，这种梦想对污染，化石燃料的有限界限或可能造成损失的外国战争一无所知。他们对自己和自己的世界充满自满，快乐和完全满足。在梦中，那是他们的世界。</p><p> Behind me, the illuminated city: Searchlights swept the sky for the sheer joy of it. I imagined them thronging the plazas of white marble, orderly and alert, their bright eyes shining with enthusiasm for their floodlit avenues and silver cars.</p><p> 在我身后的是发光的城市：探照灯扫过天空，为其增添了无限的欢乐。我以为他们挤满了白色大理石的广场，井然有序，机警，明亮的眼睛充满热情地照亮了他们泛光灯火的大街和银色的汽车。</p><p>  I put the car in gear and drove forward slowly, until the bumper was within three feet of them. They still hadn’t seen me. 1 rolled the window down and listened to what the man was saying. His words were bright and hollow as the pitch in some chamber of commerce brochure, and I knew that he believed in them absolutely.</p><p>  我把汽车放上档，缓慢向前行驶，直到保险杠在它们三英尺内。他们仍然没有看到我。 1把窗户滚下来，听了那个男人在说什么。他的话像某个商会小册子中的沥青一样明亮而空洞，我知道他绝对相信它们。</p><p> “John,” I heard the woman say, “we’ve forgotten to take our food pills.” She clicked two bright wafers from a thing on her belt and passed one to him. I backed onto the highway and headed for Los Angeles, wincing and shaking my head.</p><p> “约翰，”我听到那个女人说，“我们忘记吃我们的食物药了。”她从皮带上的东西上敲了两下明亮的威化饼，然后递给了他。我退回到高速公路上，前往洛杉矶，摇了摇头。</p><p> I phoned Kihn from a gas station. A new one, in bad Spanish Modern. He was back from his expedition and didn’t seem to mind the call.</p><p> 我从加油站给基恩打了电话。一个新的，在糟糕的西班牙现代。他从探险队中回来了，似乎不介意这个电话。</p><p> “Yeah, that is a weird one. Did you try to get any pictures? Not that they ever come out, but it adds an interesting  frisson to your story, not having the pictures turn out. …”</p><p>“是的，那很奇怪。您是否尝试获取任何图片？并不是说它们曾经出现过，而是在您的故事中增加了一个有趣的弗里森，而没有照片出来。 ……”</p><p>   “Watch lots of television, particularly game shows and soaps. Go to porn movies. Ever see  Nazi Love Motel? They’ve got it on cable, here. Really awful. Just what you need.”</p><p>   “看很多电视，特别是游戏节目和肥皂。去看色情电影。见过纳粹爱情汽车旅馆吗？他们已经在这里用电缆了。真可怕正是您所需要的。”</p><p>  “Quit yelling and listen to me. I’m letting you in on a trade secret: Really bad media can exorcise your semiotic ghosts. If it keeps the saucer people off my back,</p><p>  “别大喊，听我说。我要告诉您一个商业秘密：真的不好的媒体可以驱使您的符号幽灵。如果它使飞碟人远离我，</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/吉布森/">#吉布森</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/continuum/">#continuum</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
