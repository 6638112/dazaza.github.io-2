Image Credit: Dog Company CC BY-NC-ND 2.0\n      On June 13, the Hubble Space Telescope&#39;s payload computer stopped working, bringing the great instrument&#39;s operations to a halt. Several attempts have been made to restart \u2013 so far without success \u2013 and astronomers are bracing themselves for the possibility this is the end for the telescope that changed our view of the universe.\n NASA has revealed only limited information about the Hubble trouble and is close-lipped about the chances of getting it up and operating again. On June 16, the NASA website  announced; \u201cAfter analyzing the data, the Hubble operations team is investigating whether a degrading memory module led to the computer halt. The team is preparing to switch to one of several backup modules.\u201d\n Two days later, on June 18, an update  reported; \u201cWhen the operations team attempted to switch to a back-up memory module, however, the command to initiate the backup module failed to complete. Another attempt was conducted on both modules Thursday evening to obtain more diagnostic information while again trying to bring those memory modules online. However, those attempts were not successful.\u201d\n The Hubble Twitter account is no more enlightening. Besides tweeting a link to the media release, its most recent update was a  Father&#39;s day message about Lyman Spitzer, considered the telescope&#39;s parent.\n  Four missions to Hubble fixed problems and upgraded parts of the instruments. However, the last servicing mission took place  in 2009\u00a0\u2013 even that only occurred after a  widespread public campaign. At the time the  JWST, seen as a replacement for Hubble despite operating largely at longer wavelengths, was expected to come into operation soon, reducing Hubble&#39;s importance.\n Twelve years later, with the JWST  still not launched, optimism about its capacity to fill the void Hubble will leave is much more muted, but there are no plans to extend Hubble&#39;s life. Although some hope Hubble could have another ten or even twenty years in it, if a major failure occurs it&#39;s unlikely to be revived.\n Hubble has survived some scares before, most recently a  gyroscope failure before  returning to full capacity.\n It&#39;s hard to believe after 30 years of photographs of  mesmerizing beauty and data that has  transformed our knowledge of almost every field of astronomy, Hubble was once a by-word for failure and government waste. Delays caused by the Challenger disaster and numerous equipment replacements caused the mission&#39;s costs to blow out before Hubble left the ground. Once in space, the primary mirror was revealed to have been polished to the wrong shape. Astonishingly, evidence of the problem had been dismissed, rather than inspiring further checks.\n Although some important work could still be conducted, the telescope remained the butt of widespread  jokes and derision until corrective mirrors  resolved the problem. Since then, however, Hubble has become perhaps the most important single scientific instrument since Galileo\u2019s first telescope. Coming so soon after the collapse of the  Arecibo Observatory, its loss would be a major hit to the astronomical community&#39;s morale.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 07:29:29", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u91cd\u542f,glitch,\u54c8\u52c3", "title": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6545\u969c\u505c\u6b62\u4e86\u54c8\u52c3\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u3002 \u5230\u76ee\u524d\u4e3a\u6b62\uff0c\u91cd\u542f\u5931\u8d25 ", "title_en": "A Computer Glitch Stopped Hubble's Operations.

That hasn\u2019t stopped hordes from stampeding to the local doc-in-a-box for antibody testing. But to get a reliable answer from testing, vaccinated people have to get a specific kind of test, and at the right time.\n Take the test too soon, or rely on one that looks for the wrong antibodies \u2014 all too easy to do, given the  befuddling array of tests now available \u2014 and you may believe yourself to still be vulnerable when you are not.\n Actually, scientists would prefer that the average vaccinated person not get antibody testing at all, on the grounds that it\u2019s unnecessary. In clinical trials, the vaccines authorized in the United States provoked a strong antibody response in virtually all of the participants.\n \u201cMost people shouldn\u2019t even be worrying about this,\u201d said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University.\n But antibody tests can be crucial for people with  weak immune systems or those who take certain medications \u2014 a broad category encompassing millions of people who are recipients of organ donations, have certain blood cancers, or who take steroids or other drugs that suppress the immune system. Mounting evidence suggests that a significant proportion of these people do not produce a sufficient antibody response after vaccination.\n If you must get tested, or just want to, it\u2019s essential to get the right kind of test, Dr. Iwasaki said: \u201cI feel a little bit hesitant to recommend everybody getting tested, because unless they really understood what the test is doing, people might get this wrong sense of not having developed any antibodies.\u201d\n  Early in the pandemic, many commercial tests were designed to look for antibodies to a coronavirus protein called the nucleocapsid, or just N, because after infection, those antibodies  were plentiful in the blood.\n But these antibodies are not as powerful as those required to prevent virus infection, nor do they last as long. More important, antibodies to the N protein are not produced by the vaccines authorized in the United States; instead, those vaccines provoke antibodies to another protein sitting on the surface of the virus, called the spike.\n If people who were never infected are vaccinated and then are tested for antibodies to the N protein instead of to the spike, they may be in for a rude shock.\n  David Lat, a 46-year-old legal writer in Manhattan, was hospitalized for Covid-19 for three weeks in March 2020, and he chronicled most of his illness and recovery on Twitter.\n Over the following year, Mr. Lat was tested for antibodies numerous times \u2014 when he went to his pulmonologist or cardiologist for follow-ups, for example, or to donate plasma. His antibody levels were high in June 2020 but steadily fell over the following months.\n  The decline \u201cdidn\u2019t worry me,\u201d Mr. Lat recalled recently. \u201cI had been told to expect that they would naturally wane, but I was just happy that I was still positive.\u201d\n Mr. Lat was fully vaccinated by March 22 of this year. But an antibody test on April 21, ordered by his cardiologist, was barely positive. Mr. Lat was stunned: \u201cI would have thought a month after being immunized, I would have antibodies through the roof.\u201d\n Mr. Lat  turned to Twitter for an explanation. Florian Krammer, an immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, responded, asking Mr. Lat which test had been used. \u201cThat\u2019s when I looked at the fine print on the test,\u201d Mr. Lat said. He realized it was a test for antibodies to the N protein, not to the spike.\n \u201cIt seems that by default, they just give you the nucleocapsid one,\u201d Mr. Lat said. \u201cI never thought to ask for a different one.\u201d\n In May, the Food and Drug Administration recommended against the use of antibody tests for assessing immunity \u2014 a decision that has  drawn criticism from some scientists \u2014 and provided only bare-bones information about testing to health care providers. Many doctors are still unaware of the differences between antibody tests, or the fact that the tests measure just one form of immunity to the virus.\n Rapid tests that are commonly available deliver a yes-no result and may miss low levels of antibodies. A certain type of lab test, called an Elisa test, may offer a semi-quantitative estimate of antibodies to the spike protein.\n It\u2019s also important to wait to be tested at least two weeks after the second shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, when antibody levels will have risen enough to be detectable. For some people receiving the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, that period may be as long as four weeks.\n \u201cIt\u2019s the timing and the antigen and the sensitivity of the assay \u2014 these are going to be very important,\u201d Dr. Iwasaki said.\n In November, the World Health Organization  set standards for antibody testing, allowing for comparison of different tests. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good tests out there now,\u201d Dr. Krammer said. \u201cLittle by little, all these manufacturers, all these places that run them are adapting to international units.\u201d\n Antibodies are just one aspect of immunity, noted Dr. Dorry Segev, a transplant surgeon and researcher at Johns Hopkins University: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot happening under the surface that antibody tests are not directly measuring.\u201d The body also maintains so-called cellular immunity, a complex network of defenders that also responds to invaders.\n Still, for someone who is vaccinated but immunocompromised, it may be very helpful to know that protection against the virus isn\u2019t what it should be, he said. For example, a transplant patient with poor antibody levels might be able to use test results to convince an employer that he or she should continue to work remotely.\n Mr. Lat has not sought another test. Just learning that the vaccine most likely has given him a fresh increase of antibodies, despite his test results, was reassurance enough: \u201cI trust that the vaccines work.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-22 07:28:59", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u77e5\u9053,vaccine,\u6297\u4f53", "title": "\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\u75ab\u82d7\u662f\u5426\u6709\u6548\uff1f \u5728\u5408\u9002\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5f97\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5 ", "title_en": "Wondering If the Vaccine Worked?

The tech industry is skipping any sort of a summer slowdown. Facebook is taking on Clubhouse and Spotify, India is still figuring out how to manage its burgeoning technology industry, and everyone is raising money. Plus, we have notes on a new VC fund that has quite a twist. Let\u2019s get into it! \u2014  Alex\n  Facebook wants your voice:\u00a0Facebook\u2019s live-audio service is out, putting Big Blue in competition with Clubhouse, a buzzy startup,  and Spotify. In the wake of Clubhouse\u2019s super-active early 2021, a host of Big Tech companies are looking to capture the magic that the startup managed to bottle. How successful Facebook will be at cutting in on Clubhouse\u2019s game is not clear; so far, Facebook has  yet to dominate the dating world, for example, making its entrance into the live-audio space more potential than promise of domination.\n Consumer fintech is looking good: \u00a0New numbers from European fintech unicorn Revolut dropped today, with TechCrunch\u2019s  Romain Dillet taking a look at the company for our publication. The gist is that Revolut had a deeply unprofitable 2020, but one that showed a real ramp toward smaller losses as it went on. I  doodled on the company\u2019s numbers here, if that\u2019s your thing.\n IPOs keep coming: \u00a0Sure, we\u2019re still waiting for Robinhood to file to go public, but after  WalkMe\u2019s public debut last week, there are new tech companies approaching the public markets. Couchbase filed today, kicking off the process of floating the database software company backed by Accel, Mayfield and Ignition Partners. Expect more filings in the coming weeks.\n  To keep proper tabs on both sides of the startup fundraising marketplace, we\u2019re stripping VC news into its own section on occasion. Today is one such day. First, however, some startup news:\n $10M for e-bikes:\u00a0Ubco, a New Zealand-based electric utility bike startup, announced a $10 million raise today. The company is best known for its Ubco 2X2, an \u201call-wheel-drive electric motorbike that looks like a dirt bike but rides like a moped\u201d \u2014 and looks rather fetching. Urban transit is changing as cities look to limit their car \u2014 and carbon \u2014 footprints. If trends hold, startups like Ubco could find themselves selling into a market that is moving in their direction.\n Consumers love debt:\u00a0TechCrunch covered news today that Kredivo, an Indonesian buy now, pay later (BNPL) startup, added $100 million to its credit facilities. The new capital access doubles the amount of debt that Kredivo can access. The news illustrates both the global consumer appetite for rejiggered debt products that transcend traditional credit cards, as well as the willingness of investors around the world to provide BNPL companies with ever more capital access.  More on the subject here.\n Music licensing remains complicated, lucrative:\u00a0When  Ludacris rapped that up-and-coming artists should \u201cget a entertainment lawyer in the music profession,\u201d he wasn\u2019t kidding. The musical world is complicated. Mechanical licenses, platform cuts \u2014 it\u2019s a lot. And where there\u2019s complexity, there\u2019s opportunity. Songtradr just raised $50 million to help license music to \u201chigh-profile names for advertising, films, TV, gaming and the like,\u201d TechCrunch wrote in covering its latest round. Songtradr has now raised more than $100 million to fund its efforts.\n Are shoes still hot?\u00a0Backers of SoleSavy think so. They just put $12.5 million into the company\u2019s Series A round. Unlike StockX \u2014  which is big business these days \u2014 SoleSavy isn\u2019t a retail marketplace. Instead, it\u2019s a company looking to build a sneaker head community. A community is like a subreddit, but on a different CMS and hosting provider, in case you\u2019d forgotten.\n  What educational background generates the best entrepreneurs? Every university will tell you that they are the best. Many founders manage without a degree at all. The Academy Investor Network is betting that graduates of American military academies will prove lucrative. The fund  just announced a $2.5 million anchor LP for its first fund, adding to capital from Scout Ventures, where co-founder Emily McMahan is a venture partner. She\u2019s partnering with Sherman Williams in targeting a $50 million first raise.\n Let\u2019s see how far their thesis carries them. At least they will be able to brag with confidence that when it comes to  rucking they will have the highest founder quality in the world.\n  Usually, a teacher who grades students on a curve is boosting the efforts of those who didn\u2019t perform well on the test. In the case of cloud companies, however, it\u2019s the other way around.\n As of Q1 2021, startups in this sector have a median Series A around $8 million, reports PitchBook. With $100+ million rounds becoming more common, company valuations are regularly boosted into the billions.\n Andy Stinnes, general partner at Cloud Apps Capital Partners, says founders who are between angel and Series A should seek out investors who are satisfied with $200,000 to $500,000 in ARR. Usually a specialist firm, these VCs are open to betting on startups that haven\u2019t yet found product-market fit.\n  (Extra Crunch is our membership program, which helps founders and startup teams get ahead.

All the activity is attracting complaints and possible government intervention. TechCrunch reported today that India \u201cproposed \u2026 banning flash sales on e-commerce platforms and preventing their affiliate entities from being listed as sellers as the South Asian market looks to further tighten rules.\u201d\n India\u2019s government is also  busy battling with Twitter, as we\u2019ve reported at length.\n Germany is not enthused with Apple: \u00a0With a fourth investigation opened, this time involving Apple, Germany\u2019s oversight of competition in the tech world ratcheted up another few degrees today. In the case of Big Phone, the governmental body will \u201cdetermine whether or not the iPhone maker meets the threshold of Germany\u2019s updated competition law.\u201d If Apple does, it would allow the country\u2019s government to \u201cintervene proactively\u201d regarding the company\u2019s activity.\n Apple is also taking fire in its domestic market for what some perceive as heavy-handed tactics regarding its mobile app ecosystem, a market that the Cupertino-based company both moderates and extracts rents from.\n Uber buys Cornershop:\u00a0Today is a notable day for Latin American tech startups as the U.S. ride-hailing giant agreed to buy the 47% of Cornershop that it doesn\u2019t own. The price? 29 million Uber shares. That\u2019s about $1.3 billion worth of Uber equity.\n The car service and delivery magnate bought Postmates last year, adding to its ability to deliver more than merely rides. The Cornershop buy fits into the thesis because the smaller company is also in the delivery market.\n   TechCrunch wants to help startups find the right expert for their needs.

their first in-game ads inside the title  Blaston from the prolific VR game developer Resolution Games, and just days later the game studio has shared that after hearing an earful from users they\u2019ve decided to abandon the ad rollout.\n \u201cAfter listening to player feedback, we realize that Blaston isn\u2019t the best fit for this type of advertising test,\u201d a tweet from the  Blaston account read. \u201cTherefore, we no longer plan to implement the test. We look forward to seeing you in the arena and hope you try the Crackdown Update that went live today!\u201d\n  This potential ad rollout had been particularly noteworthy because the ads were being tested inside a title from a third-party developer. Facebook has purchased a handful of VR studios in recent months and owns a number of the most popular Quest titles inside its marketplace, so the opportunity to roll out advertising with a third-party partner gave Facebook an chance to frame the advertising rollout as a way for other developers to open up their monetization channels, rather than for Facebook to do so.\n The announcement last week still brought out plenty of critics in the VR community who weren\u2019t thrilled about Facebook\u2019s broader struggles with balancing advertising efforts with user privacy, but other users seemed to be more annoyed by the prospect of ads being rolled out inside a paid title they had already purchased.  Blaston retails for $9.99 in the Oculus store.\n Resolution Games abandoning the test before it even started is an early setback for Facebook\u2019s VR advertising efforts that showcases just how skeptical the Oculus platform\u2019s most vocal users still are of Facebook. In a blog post last week, Facebook sought to address early concerns with what user data would be used to serve up advertising in VR, specifically noting that conversations recorded by the headset\u2019s microphone and images analyzed by the onboard tracking cameras would not be used.\n Facebook saw considerable backlash last year from virtual reality fans when they shared that new headset owners would need a Facebook account in order to activate their devices. While criticism poured in following the announcement, the recently released $299 Quest 2 headset has already outsold all of Facebook\u2019s previous VR devices combined, the company has said.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 06:47:38", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "facebook,\u5e7f\u544a,\u8fdb\u5165,entry", "title": "Facebook\u7684\u8fdb\u5165VR\u5e7f\u544a\u4e0d\u4f1a\u592a\u597d ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tFacebook\u2019s entry into VR advertising isn\u2019t going too well\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebooks-entry-into-vr-advertising-isnt-going-too-well/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["facebook", "\u5e7f\u544a", "\u8fdb\u5165", "entry"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c0e1be35788304c1f8d3f08471141a59.png", "infoid": 1067308, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6682\u65e0\u8bc4\u8bba \uff1a ", "note_en": "No comments :", "posttime": "2021-06-22 06:39:56", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe,framework,\u6682\u65e0", "title": "SLSA\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6 ", "title_en": "SLSA, an End-to-End Framework for Supply Chain Integrity", "transed": 1, "url": "https://security.googleblog.com/2021/06/introducing-slsa-end-to-end-framework.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe", "framework", "\u6682\u65e0"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "2cbf030bcdcc24d01234e98cd7ff3a36.jpg", "infoid": 1067307, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8499\u7279\u5229\u5c14\u4e0b\u6b21\u4e58\u5750\u7535\u68af\u5230\u653f\u5e9c\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u542c\u5230\u8f83\u5c11\u7684\u7f8e\u56fd\u6d41\u884c\u51fb\u4e2d\uff0c\u4eceCeline Dion\uff06\uff0339;

He has 20.5 career sacks. He played in college for Penn State (where I am a proud alum).\n No openly active gay or bi player has ever played a down in an NFL regular season game.

and currently meet UK air quality targets. However despite this drop, airborne particles in London are still highly lead-enriched compared to natural background levels, according to new Imperial research published today in  PNAS.    The study found that up to 40 percent of lead in airborne particles today comes from the legacy of leaded petrol. The researchers say this highlights the long-term persistence of contaminants introduced by human activities in the environment.\n  Lead author of the study Dr. El\u00e9onore Resongles, who carried out the work at Imperial&#39;s Department of Earth Science and Engineering, said, &#34;Petrol-derived lead deposited decades ago remains an important pollutant in London. Despite the leaded petrol ban, historically combusted lead is still present in London&#39;s air more than 20 years later.&#34;\n  The researchers compared the chemical and isotopic composition of particulate matter in the air with samples of road dust and urban soil, which confirmed the role of the resuspension of dust contaminated from leaded petrol in lead&#39;s persistence in London today.\n  They explained that lead from leaded petrol once settled in the environment and is steadily re-suspended into the air through wind and vehicle movement, providing a constant background level and remobilisation mechanism.\n  They say this also highlights a potential hazard that warrants further investigation into its effects on Londoners&#39; health as, despite air quality targets, there is no &#39;safe&#39; threshold for lead in humans.\n  Dr. Resongles added, &#34;Long-term low-level exposure to lead can adversely affect health, and while we don&#39;t yet know the health implications of our findings, they suggest that leaded petrol might still be providing low level exposure which can have detrimental effects on health.&#34;\n    Lead has historically been used in a variety of ways, from petrol, batteries, alloys and solders to piping and paint in homes and buildings\u2014and until 1999, leaded petrol remained the primary source of lead emissions in the UK atmosphere. The use of lead in petrol has ceased in most countries worldwide because of evidence that exposure to lead causes neurodevelopmental problems in children and cardiovascular, kidney, and reproductive problems in adults.\n  The study, which included researchers from French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development and Princeton University in collaboration with University of Birmingham, German Meteorological Service, and King Abdulaziz University, measured the concentrations of lead and its isotopic composition in two London locations between 2014 and 2018, before comparing them with previous data from the 1960s, &#39;70s, &#39;90s, and 2010.\n    The researchers took eighteen samples of   at street level in Marylebone in the summer of 2018, and 20 samples on a 24-meter-high rooftop at Imperial&#39;s South Kensington campus between 2014 and 2018.\n  By comparing with historical data the isotopic composition of air particles in London, they found that lead sources have remained unchanged over the past decade. They also found that the isotope composition of the air particles was similar to the signature of soils and road dust, leading them to suggest that resuspension of lead-containing dust, perhaps with wind and vehicle movement, is now an important source of lead.\n  In the 1980s, annual average airborne lead concentrations in central London dropped from 500-600 ng/m 3 of air to around 300 ng/m 3, before dropping further to around 20 ng/m 3 in 2000. The researchers in this study measured lead concentrations of 8 ng/m 3 of air on average during the summer 2018 at Marylebone Road.\n  Senior author Professor Dominik Weiss, also of Imperial&#39;s Department of Earth Science and Engineering, said, &#34;We used to have a lot of lead circulating in the air, but it dropped dramatically when leaded   was phased out at the turn of the millennium. However, the evolution of isotope composition since then suggests that lead in the air, soil and dust persists at background levels, and this could turn out to be a concern for health.\n  &#34;Our findings highlight the need for an in depth study of blood   in the population as was done recently in the U.S. Legacy lead deposited pre-1999 is significantly contributing to the overall lead burden, so we must try to reduce further the amount of lead we are releasing today if we want to offset legacy metals.\n  &#34;The findings from the London study are in line with results from similar studies we conducted in Sao Paolo, Brazil and raise questions about long-term lead contamination in other megacities worldwide.&#34;\n  The researchers say that if these current levels prove harmful, then measures should be taken to target the sources of the lead in soil and on roads.\n  Possible measures to lower lead levels include covering contaminated urban soils with fresh soil, which has been effective in reducing children&#39;s blood lead levels in New Orleans. Dr. Resongles said, &#34;Atmospheric lead has reached a baseline in London which is difficult to push down further with present policy measures. More research is needed to identify the effect of present air concentrations\u2014even if they meet data air quality targets\u2014on human health, and to find the best way to rid London of lead&#39;s legacy for good.&#34;

Efforts to make Rust a viable language for Linux kernel development began at the 2020 Linux Plumbers conference, with acceptance for the idea coming from Linus Torvalds himself. Torvalds specifically requested Rust compiler availability in the default kernel build environment, to support such efforts\u2014not to replace the entire source code of the Linux kernel with Rust-developed equivalents, but to make it possible for new development to work properly.\n Using Rust for new code in the kernel\u2014which might mean new hardware drivers or even replacement of GNU Coreutils\u2014potentially decreases the number of bugs lurking in the kernel. Rust simply won&#39;t allow a developer to leak memory or create the potential for buffer overflows\u2014significant sources of performance and security issues in complex C-language code.\n     The new contract from the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG) gives Ojeda a full-time paycheck to continue memory safety work he was already doing on a part-time basis. ISRG Executive Director Josh Aas notes that the group has worked closely with Google engineer Dan Lorenc and that financial support from Google itself is critical to sponsoring Ojeda&#39;s ongoing work.\n &#34;Large efforts to eliminate entire classes of security issues are the best investments at scale,&#34; Lorenc said, adding that Google is &#34;thrilled to [help] the ISRG support Miguel Ojeda&#39;s work dedicated to improving the memory safety of the kernel for everyone.&#34;\n  Ojeda&#39;s work is the first project to be sponsored under the ISRG&#39;s Prossimo banner, but it&#39;s not the first step the organization has taken for greater memory safety. Previous initiatives include a memory-safe TLS module for the Apache web server, a memory-safe version of the  curl\u00a0data transfer utility, and  rustls\u2014a memory-safe alternative to the ubiquitous OpenSSL network encryption library.\n The Prossimo initiatives can be found at  memorysafety.org, along with donation links\u2014the ISRG and its Prossimo projects are 100 percent supported by charitable donations, from both individuals and community-minded companies.

Some might see it as an unexpected turn from Spielberg&#39;s company, given the director&#39;s past stances on streaming movies. Two years ago, an Amblin spokesperson publicly announced  that Spielberg intended to support changes to the Academy Awards that would reclassify Netflix films as TV movies, ineligible for Oscars like Best Picture.\n The push was planned during a time when Netflix-distributed film  Roma was poised to sweep the awards shows. But in the end, the Academy  rejected the calls from Spielberg and others to restrict eligibility.\n As is often the case, today&#39;s press release was accompanied by prewritten statements by various executives involved, including Spielberg himself. The quote attributed to him says:\n    At Amblin, storytelling will forever be at the center of everything we do, and from the minute [Ted Sarandos, Netflix co-CEO and chief content officer] and I started discussing a partnership, it was abundantly clear that we had an amazing opportunity to tell new stories together and reach audiences in new ways. This new avenue for our films, alongside the stories we continue to tell with our longtime family at Universal and our other partners, will be incredibly fulfilling for me personally since we get to embark on it together with Ted, and I can\u2019t wait to get started with him, [Scott Stuber, Netflix Head of Global Film], and the entire Netflix team.\n Amblin is not new to streaming. The company has already produced films that have played prominently or exclusively on streaming platforms, perhaps most notably the Netflix original  The Trial of the Chicago 7 released last fall. Amblin has also produced a post-apocalyptic drama called  Finch that is scheduled to air on Apple TV+ later this year.\n Today&#39;s announcement could be a win for Netflix, which now faces numerous viable competitors (such as HBO Max or Disney+) in a streaming TV/film space that it has previously dominated.\n But if you&#39;re a fan of Spielberg&#39;s films, don&#39;t get too excited just yet: Amblin produces films made by directors other than Spielberg, so this deal is no guarantee that we&#39;ll be seeing the next Spielberg movie on Netflix.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 05:56:27", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4ea4\u6613,spielberg,\u7535\u5f71", "title": "Steven Spielberg\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u516c\u53f8\u4e0eNetflix\u7b7e\u7f72Multifilm\u4ea4\u6613 ", "title_en": "Steven Spielberg\u2019s production company signs multifilm deal with Netflix", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/steven-spielbergs-production-company-signs-multifilm-deal-with-netflix/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4ea4\u6613", "spielberg", "\u7535\u5f71"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "10ce5f01d343c28c065405b7956aee9f.jpg", "infoid": 1067299, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u97e9\u56fd\u8f66\u8f86\u5236\u9020\u5546\u73b0\u4ee3\u6c7d\u8f66\u96c6\u56e2\u5ba3\u5e03\u6536\u8d2d\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u516c\u53f8\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u80a1\u6743\u3002\n  \u8be5\u4ea4\u6613\u4e8e\u53bb\u5e7412\u6708\u542f\u52a8\uff0c\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u516c\u53f8\u5c06\u8d2d\u4e708.8\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4efd\u989d\u3002\u8fd9\u7b14\u4ea4\u6613\u5c06\u6d89\u53ca\u73b0\u4ee3\u53ca\u5176\u9644\u5c5e\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u73b0\u4ee3\u6c7d\u8f66\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u6c47\u96c6\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u683c\u6d1b\u6c83\u516c\u53f8\n \u73b0\u4ee3\u7535\u673a\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u6469\u6bd4\u65af\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u6765\u7684\u683c\u6d1b\u74e6\u548c\u6d8c\u6b27\u68ee\u8463\u4e8b\u957f\u5206\u522b\u670930\uff05\uff0c20\uff05\uff0c10\uff05\u548c20\uff05\u3002\n \u8fd9\u7b14\u4ea4\u6613\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u949f\u6b63\u5f0f\u63a5\u7ba1\u97e9\u56fd\u6c7d\u8f66\u516c\u53f8\u9886\u5bfc\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u6536\u8d2d\u3002\u6295\u8d44\u5c06\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u4ee3\u9686\u8d77\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u5382\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u7269\u6d41\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u4e1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002\n    \u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5df2\u77e5\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7528\u4e8e\u91ca\u653e\u6280\u672f\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u673a\u5668\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53ef\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u72d7\u72b6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u65e5\u672c\u6295\u8d44\u516c\u53f8SoftBank\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ef7\u503c\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u52a8\u6001\u7ea6\u4e3a11\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n \u6b64\u6b21\u6536\u8d2d\u8fd8\u65e8\u5728\u878d\u5165\u6d77\u62d4\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u884c\u4e1a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5185\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002\n M\uff06amp;\u4ea4\u6613\u9075\u5faa\u73b0\u4ee3\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u5347\u9ad8\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6295\u8d44\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u8be5\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u5360\u4e0a\u98ce\u3002 12\u6708\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8fd8\u5ba3\u5e03\u5c06\u6295\u8d4460.1\u4e07\u4ebf\u97e9\u5143\uff0c\u4ee5\u81f3\u4e8e2025\u5e74\u4ee5\u4f9b\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u3002 \n2019\u5e7410\u6708\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5ba3\u5e03\uff0c\u5176\u4e00\u534a\u7684\u4e1a\u52a1\u5c06\u4e0e\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u8054\u7cfb\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u57ce\u5e02\u7a7a\u8fd0\u80fd\u529b\u5360\u636e\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5ea7\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u662f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002 ", "note_en": "South Korean vehicle manufacturer Hyundai Motor Group has  announced the acquisition of a controlling stake in the U.S robotics firm Boston Dynamics.\n  The deal was initiated last year in December, where the automaking firms will buy a share of $880 million.

In February 2020, he  said digital assets like Bitcoin ( BTC) lack the basic tenants of a stable currency and praised the Securities and Exchange Commission for \u201ccracking down\u201d on initial coin offerings.\n Kashkari is not a member of this year\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee, the group responsible for setting United States monetary policy. The Minneapolis branch of the Fed will  serve as an alternate FOMC member in 2022 before rotating back onto the committee as a voting member in 2023.\n While Kashkari isn\u2019t voting on monetary policy this year, he  opposes any measures to hike interest rates before 2023. The Fed\u2019s dot-plot summary of interest rate forecasts released last week suggests that policymakers are eyeing a resumption of rate hikes by the end of 2023, which is earlier than previously expected.\n  The revised forecast may have contributed to the sharp rise in the U.S. dollar at the expense of equities, commodities and even cryptocurrencies. Digital asset values were down across the board on Sunday, extending a sharp correction from  last week\u2019s mild recovery.\n Assets like DOGE burst into the mainstream earlier this year with retail-driven FOMO that was aided by favorable tweets from Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The hype surrounding Dogecoin even eclipsed that of Bitcoin in January as  tweet volumes surged 1,800%. But as crypto values plunged, DOGE was hit especially hard. As Cointelegraph reported,  Dogecoin liquidations briefly surpassed those of Bitcoin in April.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 05:48:49", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u603b\u7edf,fed,\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a", "title": "\u660e\u5c3c\u963f\u6ce2\u5229\u65af\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8\u603b\u7edf\u5409\u5c14\u5361\u4ec0\u5361\u91cc\u547c\u5401Duge Ponzi\u8ba1\u5212 ", "title_en": "Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari Calls DOGE a Ponzi Scheme", "transed": 1, "url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/minneapolis-fed-president-neel-kashkari-calls-doge-a-ponzi", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u603b\u7edf", "fed", "\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "6b8de5bc2836042024ccee878a1f38e9.jpeg", "infoid": 1067296, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5dde\u8428\u514b\u62c9\u95e8\u6258\uff08AP\uff09 -  Gov.Gavin Newsom\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5dde\u5c06\u507f\u8fd8\u5728\u5168\u56fd\u6700\u5177\u4eba\u53e3\u7a20\u5bc6\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u6240\u6709\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u79df\u91d1\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u5927\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u627f\u8bfa\u5728\u7ed9\u79df\u623f\u65f6\u4f7f\u623f\u4e1c\u603b\u4f53\u878d\u4e3a\u4e00\u4f53 \u6e05\u6d01\u677f\u5ca9\u3002 ", "note_en": "SACRAMENTO, Calif.

", "note_en": "I can no longer feel the top of my head. Apparently it takes 3-5 months to regain sensation up there, and some people never get the feeling back. Oh well, what do you need to feel things from the top of your head for anyway?\n But, it\u2019s truly bizarre touching the top of my head and only getting feedback from my hand. Almost like touching someone else\u2019s head except my brain knows where my hand is and seems to get confused, as if it doesn\u2019t know how to close the loop. Proof I guess of just how connected the body and the mind are.\n Anyway, you probably want to know, what its like? What does it feel like to be awake while someone is drilling deep inside your head? Well, let me walk you through it as best as I can.\n  The day began by getting this lovely looking frame bolted onto my skull. It didn\u2019t feel as bad as it looks. They froze the areas where the bolts go so other than the weight and some added pressure around my skull I couldn\u2019t really feel it. But, after they turned me into a cartoon supervillain, I learned that an emergency case had come in that would delay my surgery by an hour or two. So, I sat there in the cramped pre-op room staring at the other patients who were doing their best not to look horrified when we made eye contact.\n Eventually I got wheeled into the OR. Like a guest of honor there were many onlookers waiting for me when I got there. In addition to the surgical team itself of at least 7 or 8 people, there were a couple rows of students who had come to watch and learn.\n First I was laid out on the table and had the frame locked into a much larger contraption that would keep my head securely in place no matter how much I wriggled and writhed about. Then there was about half an hour of prep that the team did in a flurry of activity happening all around me. During which time my hair was cut, but only the parts that might get in the way of the procedure, giving me that classically handsome friar tuck look. Then all sorts of sterilizing ointments were applied. Between that, the oxygen, and the mild sedatives I was given it was almost starting to feel like a trip to a spa.\n    Throughout the morning I had felt very ready for what I was about to experience. I\u2019m not sure exactly what to attribute that to, but in the days preceding it my mind was completely at ease with what I was about to experience. One fear I thought I might have going in was that I would start to doubt the decision I had made.  As I wrote before, DBS was not the only option available to me. What if I got into the OR and started to second guess myself? Thankfully I never paid the thought much attention. Part of it was that I knew I was in great hands, Dr. Suneil Kalia and his team at Toronto Western Hospital are as good as it gets. It also helped that I knew I had done my homework.\n Four years earlier on a Friday morning in Jerusalem I was wandering the halls of Hadassah medical center looking for Prof. Hagai Bergman. Friday is the start of Shabbat, the day of rest when all of Jerusalem shuts down. I wandered through the empty halls of his building wondering if I had come at the wrong time, but there he was and he seemed anxious to see me.\n He ushered me into his office and spent the next three hours taking me on a guided private tour of the basal ganglia as well as a new therapy that he was helping make a reality \u2013 closed loop deep brain stimulation. I didn\u2019t realize it at the time but he was showing me my future.\n He also recommended to me a pair of books,  The Mind\u2019s I and  I Am A Strange Loop by Douglas Hofstadter. I\u2019ve had them close to me ever since and often return to them. I haven\u2019t read anything else that comes as close to explaining who and what we are, why we experience what we experience, and why we think the thoughts that we think. Some say we have no idea how DBS, or the brain for that matter, works. But, if closed loop DBS is successful, I think it would prove that while we may not ever know all the details, we do already have the right conceptual framework. We are a collection of strange loops and most of the neurological problems we face can be attributed to a break in one or more of those loops. Find the right loop or loops to close and we can fix just about anything that goes wrong.\n I haven\u2019t spoken to Prof. Bergman since, but will forever be grateful for those three hours he spent patiently explaining this new technique that I will soon be turning on inside my own head to me. Here is a taste of that lecture he gave me.\n    I\u2019ll have much more to say on closed loop DBS in the future. Back to the OR.\n Now, as much as I believed I was ready for what I was about to experience, nothing can really prepare you for what it is\u00a0like to be awake during it all. Every detail of that morning has been indelibly etched into my memory, yet I struggle to find the words to describe it. Language isn\u2019t really suited for such things and whatever words I\u2019ll choose to use won\u2019t really be able to capture it. Such is life I guess.\n I\u2019ll start with the pain, which there really isn\u2019t that much of. The only thing that really really hurt were all the needles used to freeze my scalp, after that I didn\u2019t really feel anything. So I was a little surprised when after the freezing they told me that they were ready to start drilling through my skull, meaning they had already sliced through all the various layers of my scalp.\n  Next came the drilling of the bore holes. If there is any part of this procedure that is likely to induce trauma it is this. I will never forget that sound. Usually sound is created by your ear picking up tiny vibrations of particles in the air. But in this case the sound comes more from your entire skull shaking violently to the rotating drill boring a hole through your head. I didn\u2019t hear it as much as I felt it, as if the entire universe was grinding together inside my skull.\n Once the brain is exposed the team covered themselves and me in protective gear so they can turn on the giant stereotactic imaging device that guides the surgeon through my brain deep into my subthalamic nucleus. All of that is displayed on a screen in front of you allowing yourself and the team to see everything happening in real time. This goes by surprisingly quickly and was somewhat uneventful, though I do remembered some murmured remarks between the surgeons about avoiding a particular vein somewhere along the way.\n I did wonder, what would it be like if something went wrong. What would the reactions of the surgeons have been if they tripped that vein? All through the procedure the team sounded very calm and business like. Would the tone of their words suddenly have turned to panic? And what would I experience? Would the world suddenly go dark? Would my conscious awareness and this chain of experience I call my self suddenly shift to something else?\n Anyway, once it looks like it is in the right spot, which you can tell by the lead penetrating the crosshairs on the screen, they began the microelectrode recording. They played the live sound on a speaker which emitted the different sounds of each cortical layer as it went deeper and deeper. Throughout the procedure I was talking and lucid. Lobbing question after question at the team, here Dr. Kalia had to tell me to shut up so they could listen and confirm they were in the right spot.\n The crescendo slowly builds until it reaches the target and then the sound of hundreds of thousands of your own neurons excitedly relaying the information they carry to one another fills the room. This was the most intimate moment of the day. My brain was speaking to me, though in a language \u201cI\u201d could not understand. And even though I knew there was some perturbation in that sound that was responsible for the symptoms I felt, I smiled thinking of all that was going right inside me.\n     Once they confirmed they were in the desired position the stimulation was turned on. It was in the left hemisphere of my brain which controls the right side of my body. I was asked to do a few simple movement tasks with my hands like tapping my index finger and thumb together as quickly as possible and pretending to turn a doorknob. It was roughly noon and I had not taken any medication up to that point. Normally if I had gone till noon without any medication I would have had a pronounced tremor, the tapping would have been very slow and labored, and I would have barely been able to turn my wrist over and back. But at that moment I felt as though I had travelled back in time eight years to before my diagnosis. My fingers and my wrist moved fluidly. It was liberating. I was back in control. Despite being strapped to a table with my head in a giant vice I felt euphoric. This disease had suddenly and magically dissipated. Nothing short of a modern medical miracle.\n But it was short lived as I was then reminded that the entire process needed to be repeated for the other side. Now the novelty of the whole experience wore off and I started to really feel the weight of the frame tying me down. I closed my eyes, gritted my teeth and got through it. But not without the whole thing taking its toll. A mix of nausea and a shearing headache crept over me that slowly grew in intensity. I wanted to tell them not to bother with getting this side as precise as possible, to just hurry up and get it all over with as quickly as they could.\n There is a lot more I could say about the whole ordeal, including the tunneling of the wires through my neck and the placement of the battery in my chest two days later, but I\u2019ll leave it at that for now. It has been 12 days since the operation and I am feeling much better than I would have expected, though not entirely like myself either. In less than a month I should begin programming the device which hopefully will make everything I experienced worthwhile. I\u2019m not sure exactly what I\u2019ll do if, once we get all the parameters right, they flick that switch and I get to permanently return to that state I felt when they turned on the stimulation in the OR, but suffice it to say that I am looking forward to getting there.\n The last thing I\u2019ll show is the MRI I had taken the day after. The white dots you see on the left is the inflammation surrounding the holes that were drilled. I close my eyes and wonder how all the cells surrounding that spot must be reacting, all the neurons trying to communicate with this foreign object, all the glial cells now busily forming the scar tissue that will lock those long leads you see on the right in place for the rest of my life.\n  Soon enough the stimulator will be turned on and the contacts will be activated, hopefully restoring mobility to this strange loop that I am.\n   I am very pleased that your operation appears to have gone welll; You will be looking foreward to switching it on no doubt. Keith\n    As usual. Great post! You are an inspiration and good luck turning on the juice soon, best wishes, Frank\n  This was a fascinating post to read as a neurosurgery resident. Thank you for sharing your experience, and I hope DBS works out for you.\n  The human body is an incredible, complex, designed piece of artistry.
