It’s a gray July morning on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, and the smell of smoke from a wildfire to the north mixes with the briny sea breeze. Suntok looks up for a moment, gazing at the pale sky, then picks his way down a beach access clogged with tree trunks. Along the shore, the tide has retreated, revealing an expanse of boulders coated in blankets of slick, verdant algae. Seagulls wheel overhead as the waters of nearby Muir Creek flow into the Salish Sea.</p><p>斯蒂芬·桑托克穿过一片纠结的黑莓灌木丛。在不列颠哥伦比亚省的温哥华岛上，这是一个7月的灰色早晨，北边野火的浓烟味与咸海风混合在一起。桑托克抬头看了一会儿，凝视着苍白的天空，然后沿着一条被树干堵塞的海滩通道走下去。沿着海岸，潮水退去，露出一大片巨石，上面覆盖着一层光滑的绿藻。当附近穆尔溪的海水流入萨利什海时，海鸥在头顶盘旋。</p><p> Suntok works as a criminal defense lawyer in Victoria, British Columbia’s capital city, but he spends much of his spare time in the service of science, collecting rare fossils that he donates to museums. For at least a decade and a half, he has searched shores and river gorges across Vancouver Island, collecting a wide variety of fossilized specimens—including the dental plate of a previously unknown fish,  Canadodus suntoki, which paleontologists named after him, and a rare species of crab from a beach near Campbell River, where the species was once plentiful. But of the many sites he checks regularly, few match the rock formations along Muir Creek beach when it comes to vertebrate fossils. In some spots, the sandstone cliffs and intertidal boulders are studded with fossil shells and bits of fossilized bone that date to more than 23 million years ago. It’s in this ancient boneyard that Suntok has made some of his most intriguing discoveries—the fragmentary remains of ancient whales that lived and died in the ocean here tens of millions of years ago.</p><p>桑托克在不列颠哥伦比亚省首府维多利亚市担任刑事辩护律师，但他将大部分业余时间用于科学服务，收集他捐赠给博物馆的稀有化石。在至少15年的时间里，他一直在温哥华岛的海岸和河谷进行搜寻，收集了各种各样的化石标本，包括一种名为Canadodus suntoki的鱼的牙板，古生物学家以他的名字命名，以及坎贝尔河附近海滩上的一种稀有螃蟹，那里曾经物种丰富。但在他经常检查的许多地点中，很少有能与缪尔溪海滩沿线的岩层相匹配的脊椎动物化石。在一些地方，砂岩悬崖和潮间带巨石上布满了化石外壳和可追溯到2300多万年前的骨骼化石。正是在这个古老的墓地里，桑托克做出了一些最有趣的发现，那就是数千万年前在这里的海洋中生活和死亡的古代鲸鱼的残骸。</p><p>  This morning, Suntok has agreed to take me along for a visit to this fossil site. In the distance, lush green forest spills over the tops of the cliffs that border the beach. As we slowly approach the site, weaving along the slippery beach rocks, Suntok begins scanning every boulder we pass for fossils. Up close, the curved, overhung cliff face looks barren and austere, like something from a sci-fi movie set on another planet. Each layer of stratigraphy is a stark stripe of brown, beige, or gray, and some are flecked with white shells. These rocks date to an epoch known as the Oligocene, which stretched from 33.9 to 23 million years ago. It was a time of global cooling, when grasslands expanded on land, and mammals such as horses, camels, and primates began spreading out.</p><p>今天早上，桑托克同意带我去参观这个化石遗址。远处，郁郁葱葱的绿色森林覆盖着与海滩接壤的悬崖顶部。当我们沿着光滑的海滩岩石慢慢接近遗址时，桑托克开始扫描我们经过的每一块巨石，寻找化石。近距离观察，这张弯曲、悬垂的悬崖脸看上去既贫瘠又简朴，就像科幻电影中以另一个星球为背景的场景。每一层地层都是一条棕色、米色或灰色的明显条纹，有些还点缀着白色的贝壳。这些岩石可以追溯到一个称为渐新世的时代，从3390万年前延伸到2300万年前。那是一个全球降温的时期，草原在陆地上扩张，马、骆驼和灵长类等哺乳动物开始扩散。</p><p> Suntok slides a pair of reading glasses onto his nose, then hunches down and rolls onto his back to get a better look at a low shelf near the base of the cliff. Fossils can sometimes be extremely difficult to spot, he explains. The first vertebrate fossils he found at Muir Creek belonged to an extinct species of Oligocene whale, but initially, all he could see on the surface of the rock was a tiny half-moon-shaped irregularity. It was the tip of a fossilized bone. Subsequent excavation revealed three fossil vertebrae locked in the rock. Since then, Suntok has scoured this beach dozens of times. It always looks different, he says, because the waves chip away at the cliffs, revealing new surfaces to check.</p><p>桑托克把一副阅读眼镜放在鼻子上，然后弯腰坐在背上，以便更好地看到悬崖底部附近的一个低矮的架子。他解释说，化石有时极难发现。他在缪尔溪发现的第一批脊椎动物化石属于一种已灭绝的渐新世鲸鱼，但最初，他在岩石表面只能看到一个微小的半月形不规则。那是一块骨骼化石的尖端。随后的挖掘发现岩石中有三块脊椎化石。从那以后，桑托克已经在这个海滩上搜寻了几十次。他说，它看起来总是不同的，因为海浪拍打着悬崖，露出新的表面来检查。</p><p> At the base of the cliff, Suntok continues poring over the low shelf, checking small irregularities in the rock. Soon, he spots a sliver of fossilized bone—possibly a small fragment of a rib from an ancient marine mammal. But Suntok opts to leave it in place. It’s just a scrap and removing it without the right tools would result in damage. He is only carrying a hammer and chisel today. In British Columbia, fossils found on Crown land are protected as heritage objects under the Land Act, and fossil hunters are required to report major finds so that skilled researchers can take them out with the proper tools and methods. But it’s good practice to report fossils whenever they are found.</p><p>在悬崖底部，桑托克继续仔细观察低矮的大陆架，检查岩石中的小不规则之处。很快，他发现了一块长条骨化石，可能是古代海洋哺乳动物肋骨的一小块。但尚托克选择让它留在原地。它只是一块废料，如果没有合适的工具将其移除，会造成损坏。他今天只带着一把锤子和凿子。在不列颠哥伦比亚省，根据《土地法》，在皇室土地上发现的化石作为文物受到保护，化石猎人必须报告重大发现，以便熟练的研究人员可以用适当的工具和方法将其取出。但是，无论何时发现化石都要报告，这是一种很好的做法。</p><p>  Suntok is patient when it comes to fossil hunting. He has seen for himself how precious these pieces of fossilized bone can be for the researchers who study ancient whales and other marine life. “Everything I’ve found is just a rock … until a paleontologist who knows what they’re doing studies this thing and describes it and puts flesh on the bone,” he says. “Before that, it’s just a curiosity in my cabinet.” Each whale fossil, after all, is a potential clue to the long and complex story of cetaceans, and to the dramatic transformations they underwent over millions of years. Moreover, the study of ancient whales has taken on new relevance in an era of rapid climate change. A better understanding of the remarkable evolution of cetaceans could assist researchers and conservationists alike in protecting whales in the future, as these leviathans are confronted with the increasingly harsh realities of a world dominated by humans.</p><p>在化石狩猎方面，桑托克很有耐心。他亲眼目睹了这些骨骼化石对研究古代鲸鱼和其他海洋生物的研究人员来说是多么珍贵。“我发现的一切都只是一块岩石……直到一位知道他们在做什么的古生物学家研究并描述了这件事，然后把肉放在骨头上，”他说。“在那之前，这只是我橱柜里的一个好奇心。”毕竟，每一块鲸鱼化石都是鲸类漫长而复杂的故事的潜在线索，也是它们在数百万年中经历的巨大变化的潜在线索。此外，在气候快速变化的时代，对古代鲸鱼的研究具有了新的意义。更好地了解鲸类的显著进化，可以帮助研究人员和自然资源保护主义者在未来保护鲸鱼，因为这些巨兽面临着人类主导的世界日益严峻的现实。</p><p>  Whales are among the largest animals to ever exist on Earth, with some adult blue whales reaching 180 tonnes, nearly 21 times the weight of a  Tyrannosaurus rex. And the long history of whales, which spans more than 50 million years, is chock-full of surprises. The earliest whales lived near water—but not in it—and they looked very different from the whales we know today.  Pakicetus, for example, was a wolf-sized animal with four legs, a long snout, and a big tail. It hunted small prey along the coastal margins of Pakistan some 50 million years ago. But what links  Pakicetus and the other early whales to modern cetaceans is a distinctive anatomical feature they all share: a bulbous structure in their ears known as an involucrum. This ancient structure may assist today’s whales and dolphins in hearing underwater. Early whales also had distinctive double-pulley ankle bones seen only in even-toed hoofed mammals, like camels and cows, which are now understood to be whales’ closest relatives.</p><p>鲸鱼是地球上有史以来最大的动物之一，一些成年蓝鲸重达180吨，几乎是霸王龙的21倍。鲸鱼的悠久历史跨越了5000多万年，充满了惊喜。最早的鲸鱼生活在水附近，但不在水里，它们看起来与我们今天所知道的鲸鱼非常不同。例如，Pakicetus是一种狼大小的动物，有四条腿、长长的鼻子和一条大尾巴。大约5000万年前，它在巴基斯坦海岸边缘捕猎小猎物。但将Pakicetus和其他早期鲸鱼与现代鲸类联系在一起的是它们都有一个独特的解剖学特征：耳朵中的球状结构称为总苞。这种古老的结构可能有助于今天的鲸鱼和海豚在水下听觉。早期的鲸鱼也有独特的双滑轮踝骨，只有偶数趾的有蹄哺乳动物才能看到，比如骆驼和奶牛，它们现在被认为是鲸鱼的近亲。</p><p>  As cetaceans evolved, forelimbs became flippers, nostrils shifted back to become blowholes, and legs eventually disappeared. It took whales about 10 million years to transition from land to sea, and they may have done so for a variety of reasons, which include escaping predation on land and capitalizing on abundant marine prey. But once whales were completely aquatic, they spent the next 40 million years adapting fully to life in the ocean. For much of this time, most cetaceans were little bigger than a humpback whale. Then, beginning around 4.5 million years ago, whales underwent another remarkable transformation. Many began bulking up dramatically, eventually reaching their current extreme sizes. That allowed them to bump up the amount of prey they consumed in one gulp, swim vast distances to reach places with abundant food sources, and fight off most marine predators.</p><p>随着鲸目动物的进化，前肢变成了鳍状肢，鼻孔变回气孔，最后腿消失了。鲸鱼花了大约1000万年的时间从陆地过渡到海洋，它们这样做可能有多种原因，包括逃避陆地上的捕食和利用丰富的海洋猎物。但一旦鲸鱼完全是水生动物，它们在接下来的4000万年里完全适应了海洋中的生活。在这段时间的大部分时间里，大多数鲸类都比座头鲸略大。然后，从大约450万年前开始，鲸鱼经历了另一次显著的转变。许多人开始急剧膨胀，最终达到目前的极限尺寸。这使它们能够一口吞下大量猎物，游很远的距离到达食物来源丰富的地方，击退大多数海洋捕食者。</p><p> That’s the basic, broad trajectory, but huge gaps remain in our knowledge of whales—including how baleen evolved in some species. And that’s where whale fossils come in. Fossil bones preserve enormous amounts of information, and whale fossils from the Oligocene era are particularly valuable, given the many changes that cetaceans went through at that time. The trouble is that marine fossils from that era are exceedingly difficult to find in most parts of the world. Sea levels during the Oligocene were much lower than today, so fossilized marine life from that time tends to lie deep beneath the ocean—beyond the reach of paleontologists.</p><p>这是基本的、广泛的轨迹，但我们对鲸鱼的了解仍然存在巨大差距，包括鲸须在某些物种中是如何进化的。这就是鲸鱼化石的来源。化石骨骼保存了大量的信息，鉴于当时鲸类经历了许多变化，渐新世时期的鲸鱼化石尤其有价值。问题是，在世界大部分地区很难找到那个时代的海洋化石。渐新世时期的海平面比今天低得多，所以那个时期的海洋生物化石往往位于海洋深处，超出了古生物学家的能力范围。</p><p> But in a few parts of the world, scientists have discovered rock formations on land that are littered with these rare Oligocene marine fossils. The Pacific Northwest is one such place. Sometimes, when whales and other marine animals died in the shallow oceans of the Oligocene, their skeletons were buried by sediment on the seafloor. Over time, the sediment hardened into layers of rock, and the bones sandwiched between these layers slowly petrified, becoming fossils. Eventually, major geological processes pushed these Oligocene layers above sea level in the Pacific Northwest. At localities like Muir Creek, strong waves and heavy winter rains batter the cliff faces, eroding the rock and revealing the fossils within.</p><p>但在世界上的一些地方，科学家们已经在陆地上发现了散布着这些罕见的渐新世海洋化石的岩层。太平洋西北部就是这样一个地方。有时，当鲸鱼和其他海洋动物在渐新世的浅海中死亡时，它们的骨骼被海底沉积物掩埋。随着时间的推移，沉淀物硬化成岩层，夹在岩层之间的骨骼慢慢石化，成为化石。最终，主要的地质作用将这些渐新世地层推到太平洋西北部的海平面以上。在缪尔溪（Muir Creek）等地，强烈的海浪和冬季暴雨拍打着悬崖表面，侵蚀着岩石，露出里面的化石。</p><p>  “It’s basically kind of a combination of the right conditions 25 million years ago, and then the right conditions today,” says Victoria Arbour, the curator of paleontology at the Royal BC Museum (RBCM) in Victoria. She and a recent University of Victoria graduate, Elizabeth Rohlicek, have been trying to identify a collection of cetacean fossils from Muir Creek and nearby Kirby Creek, and piece together the stories they tell about whales in the Pacific long ago.</p><p>维多利亚皇家不列颠哥伦比亚博物馆（RBCM）古生物学馆长维多利亚·阿尔布尔（Victoria Arbour）说：“这基本上是2500万年前的正确条件和今天的正确条件的结合。”。她和最近的维多利亚大学研究生Elizabeth Rohlicek一直试图从缪尔溪和附近的柯比克里克那里识别鲸鱼化石的集合，并把他们很久以前在太平洋上讲述的鲸鱼的故事拼凑起来。</p><p>  On a midsummer morning in a darkened gallery at the RBCM, Arbour and Rohlicek lead the way through a new exhibit on killer whales. Whale calls echo and blue lights swirl across the killer whale models and  Free Willy memorabilia, as Arbour, on maternity leave, pushes a stroller holding her newborn son, Oswald, or Ozzy for short. A leading expert on armored dinosaurs, Arbour clearly loves all things paleontology. Her Twitter feed brims with artists’ reconstructions of dinosaurs and other extinct animals, and she is fond of fossil-themed fashion. Today, she’s sporting a collared shirt teeming with tiny dinosaurs. Behind her, Rohlicek, the 23-year-old former student she’s mentoring, flashes a bright smile. Animated and self-assured, Rohlicek lights up when she gushes about ancient whales.</p><p>仲夏的一个早晨，在RBCM一个昏暗的画廊里，阿尔布尔和罗利切克领衔参观了一个关于虎鲸的新展览。鲸鱼的叫声回荡，蓝光在虎鲸模型和免费的威利纪念品上打转，而正在休产假的阿尔布尔推着一辆婴儿车，车上抱着她刚出生的儿子奥斯瓦尔德，简称奥兹。阿尔布尔是研究装甲恐龙的顶尖专家，他显然热爱古生物学的一切。她的推特上充斥着艺术家对恐龙和其他灭绝动物的重建，她喜欢以化石为主题的时尚。今天，她穿着一件布满小恐龙的领衬衫。在她身后，23岁的罗利切克（Rohlicek）微笑着。罗利切克曾是她辅导的学生。当罗利切克滔滔不绝地谈论古代鲸鱼时，她充满了活力和自信。</p><p>  Midway through the exhibit, the museum’s collections manager joins us. He’s pushing a cart stacked with some of the fossils found at Muir Creek. Most of these specimens, Rohlicek explains, are marked with information about where they were found and by whom. The bones and fragments—ranging from complete vertebrae and rib bones to a piece of skull—were collected by fossil finders, including Suntok, over the past 60 years. All of the specimens, however, were sitting in storage, waiting to be identified and studied when Arbour and Rohlicek began their research project in the fall of 2020.</p><p>展览进行到一半时，博物馆的藏品经理加入了我们。他推着一辆车，车上堆满了在缪尔溪发现的一些化石。罗利切克解释说，这些标本中的大多数都标有它们在哪里被发现以及被谁发现的信息。这些骨骼和碎片从完整的脊椎骨、肋骨骨到一块头骨，都是由化石发现者在过去60年中收集的，包括桑托克。然而，当阿尔布尔和罗利切克在2020年秋天开始他们的研究项目时，所有的标本都被保存起来，等待鉴定和研究。</p><p> It’s not uncommon for fossils to sit in museum drawers for decades before they are investigated, says Arbour, who joined the RBCM in 2018. Sometimes, there’s insufficient people power at museums to study them, and other times, it’s a lack of people with the right research background for a project. But often curators must wait until a collection holds enough specimens to tell a story. That’s why paleontologists urge fossil hunters to donate their finds to a university or museum where they can be preserved for future studies. A single rib from Muir Creek wouldn’t have prompted a research project, Arbour explains, but by the time Rohlicek, then an undergraduate student, joined her lab in early 2020, the collection had accumulated enough specimens to ensure an interesting takeaway.</p><p>2018年加入RBCM的阿尔布尔说，化石在被调查之前被放在博物馆抽屉里几十年并不罕见。有时，博物馆里没有足够的人来研究它们，而另一些时候，缺乏对一个项目有正确研究背景的人。但通常策展人必须等到藏品中有足够的标本来讲述一个故事。这就是为什么古生物学家敦促化石猎人将他们的发现捐赠给大学或博物馆，以便保存下来供未来研究之用。Arbour解释说，Muir Creek的一根肋骨不会引发一个研究项目，但到2020年初，当时还是本科生的Rohlicek加入她的实验室时，这个收藏已经积累了足够的标本，以确保有一个有趣的外卖。</p><p>  Rohlicek was majoring in biology and earth and ocean sciences at the time but had become enamored with paleobiology—a branch of paleontology that investigates the evolution of fossil species and how they fit into ancient ecosystems. She was considering a career in paleobiology and contacted Arbour to hear how women fare in this field, which is still dominated by men. With Arbour’s encouragement, she began volunteering in the RBCM’s paleontology lab. And after the museum was forced to close its doors in 2020 due to the pandemic, Arbour invited her to assist with a study of the Muir Creek fossil collection. Rohlicek leaped at the opportunity.</p><p>罗利切克当时主修生物学、地球和海洋科学，但却迷上了古生物学——古生物学的一个分支，研究化石物种的进化以及它们如何适应古代生态系统。她正在考虑从事古生物学的职业，并联系了阿尔布尔，以了解女性在这个仍然由男性主导的领域的表现。在阿尔布尔的鼓励下，她开始在皇家生物博物馆的古生物学实验室做志愿者。2020年，该博物馆因大流行被迫关门后，阿尔布尔邀请她协助研究缪尔溪化石收藏。罗利切克抓住了这个机会。</p><p> Access to the museum labs was restricted, however. So, starting in the fall, the two women met at the museum every Wednesday evening after closing and rolled a mobile lab—a plastic cart stocked with marine fossils, measuring tapes, and sketch pads—into the public Natural History Gallery. Next to a life-sized mammoth sculpture known affectionately as Woolly, they got to work, poring over the specimens by lamplight as the ambient nature sounds from the exhibit played on a loop—the soundtrack to their research.</p><p>然而，博物馆实验室的使用受到限制。因此，从秋天开始，两位女士每周三晚上在博物馆关门后见面，并将一个移动实验室——一辆装满海洋化石、卷尺和素描板的塑料车——推到公共自然历史画廊。在一个真人大小的长毛象雕塑旁边，他们开始工作，在灯光下仔细观察标本，周围的自然声音从展览中循环播放到他们研究的原声带上。</p><p>   For Rohlicek, analyzing all those unknown marine fossils with Arbour in such a surreal environment was both intimidating and exciting. “I had these fossils that no one had ever looked at, and that had never been published about,” she says, still marveling at the experience. To gather vital data, the pair examined each fossil carefully, photographing, sketching, and measuring it. Then they compared each to similar-looking bones from known species. In this way, they identified the body parts and determined that the fossils belonged to whales that roamed the world’s seas during the Oligocene.</p><p>对罗利切克来说，在这样一个超现实的环境中用阿尔布尔分析所有这些未知的海洋化石既令人害怕又令人兴奋。“我有这些化石，从来没有人看过，也从来没有发表过，”她说，仍然对这段经历感到惊讶。为了收集重要数据，两人仔细检查了每一块化石，并对其进行了拍照、素描和测量。然后，他们将每一块骨头与已知物种的相似骨骼进行比较。通过这种方式，他们确定了这些化石的身体部位，并确定这些化石属于渐新世期间在世界海洋中游荡的鲸鱼。</p><p> This was a time of major tectonic activity. When South America and Australia drifted north, splitting away from Antarctica, a path was cleared for a new circumpolar current. Global temperatures dropped, sea levels fell, and the new current caused widespread upwelling—a process that pushes nutrients from the deep up to the surface, resulting in localized plankton blooms. And this may have helped spur the evolution of baleen whales—called mysticetes, a name derived from Greek words meaning “mustache whale”—as they began to swap their teeth for long keratinous plates and gradually shift from hunting for meals to filter-feeding. At the same time, echolocation was developing among toothed whales, and this ability to detect distant things with the aid of reflected sound waves, allowed them to navigate in deep, dark waters and hunt the prey that flourished there. This combination of diversification and tough-to-find fossils, says Robert Boessenecker, a whale paleontologist at the College of Charleston in South Carolina, “is what makes the Oligocene so damn interesting.”</p><p>这是一个主要的构造活动时期。当南美洲和澳大利亚向北漂移，脱离南极洲时，一条新的绕极洋流的路径被清除。全球气温下降，海平面下降，新的洋流导致了大范围的上升流——这一过程将营养物质从深海推到表面，导致局部浮游生物大量繁殖。这可能有助于刺激被称为“神秘鲸鱼”的须鲸的进化，这个名字来源于希腊语，意思是“胡子鲸”——它们开始用牙齿交换长角质板，并逐渐从猎食转变为滤食。与此同时，齿鲸的回声定位技术也在发展，这种借助反射声波探测远处物体的能力，使它们能够在黑暗的深水中航行，并捕猎在那里繁衍生息的猎物。南卡罗来纳州查尔斯顿学院的鲸鱼古生物学家罗伯特·博塞内克（Robert Boessenecker）说，这种多样性和难以发现的化石的结合，“正是渐新世如此有趣的原因。”</p><p> For Rohlicek, the next step was to gather research on the cetacean species thought to have lived in the northeast Pacific during the Oligocene. She soon discovered that the Pacific Ocean was once a terrifying place where many predators lurked. One of the most nightmarish was an ancient whale with a huge, eel-like body, serrated teeth, and tiny hind limbs that couldn’t have supported its enormous body. Its name was  Basilosaurus, meaning “king lizard.” Originally classified as a reptile,  Basilosaurus dwarfed the other early whales. It measured more than 15 meters from snout to tail—about the length of a standard bowling lane—and evidence suggests that it ate smaller cetaceans, as some killer whales do today.  Basilosaurus is thought to have gone extinct before the beginning of the Oligocene, but some may have survived in certain areas after that, Rohlicek says. “It’s not like they all just died off right on the first Tuesday of the month,” she explains.</p><p>对于罗利切克来说，下一步是收集对据信在渐新世期间生活在太平洋东北部的鲸类物种的研究。她很快发现太平洋曾经是一个可怕的地方，那里潜伏着许多捕食者。其中最可怕的是一头古代鲸鱼，它有着巨大的鳗鱼般的身体，锯齿状的牙齿，小小的后肢无法支撑它巨大的身体。它的名字叫Basilosaurus，意思是“蜥蜴王”巴西龙最初被归类为爬行动物，使其他早期鲸鱼相形见绌。它从鼻子到尾巴的长度超过15米，大约相当于一条标准保龄球道的长度，有证据表明，它吃的是较小的鲸类，就像今天的一些虎鲸一样。罗利切克说，巴西龙被认为是在渐新世开始之前灭绝的，但在渐新世开始之后，一些可能在某些地区幸存下来。她解释说：“他们并不是在本月的第一个星期二就去世了。”。</p><p>  As Rohlicek continued delving into her cetacean research, Arbour began contacting paleontologists who specialize in whale evolution. She knew that she and Rohlicek would need assistance in identifying the species represented in the Muir Creek collection, and after years of rubbing shoulders with other paleontologists, Arbour knew who to ask. “People sometimes think science is very siloed and competitive,” she says, “and for sure that also happens, but it’s not all like that.” Often, she notes, getting help is as simple as calling up a colleague and saying, “Hello, Friend-who-knows-random-whale-vertebrae, what is this?” So that’s exactly what she did.</p><p>随着罗利切克继续深入她的鲸类研究，阿尔布尔开始联系专门研究鲸鱼进化的古生物学家。她知道她和罗利切克在鉴定缪尔溪收藏中代表的物种时需要帮助，在与其他古生物学家进行了多年的交流之后，阿尔布尔知道该问谁。“人们有时认为科学是非常孤立和竞争性的，”她说，“当然也会发生这种情况，但并非都是这样。”她指出，获得帮助通常很简单，只需给同事打电话，然后说：“你好，认识随机鲸鱼脊椎的朋友，这是什么？”所以她就是这么做的。</p><p> One of those colleagues was Nick Pyenson, the curator of fossil marine mammals at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. Pyenson is a vertebrate paleontologist who has spent many years studying whales, and he was willing and able to help.</p><p>其中一位同事是尼克·皮恩森，他是华盛顿特区史密森学会海洋哺乳动物化石的策展人。皮恩森是一位脊椎动物古生物学家，多年来一直在研究鲸鱼，他愿意也能够提供帮助。</p><p> One of Suntok’s fossil finds, a partial scapula with fine fractures, posed a unique challenge, says Rohlicek. After extracting it from the rock, Suntok set the fossil in plaster to prevent damage. The casing protected the specimen well, but it permanently hid one side, making the fossil difficult to identify. But Suntok’s field notes contained a vital clue: near the shoulder-blade fragment, the lawyer found a fossilized atlas—the vertebra from the base of a whale’s skull. And when Rohlicek and Arbour showed the specimens to Pyenson on a video call, he immediately recognized the small bumps on the outer edge of the fossilized atlas. They were a telltale skeletal trait of ancient river dolphins. Rohlicek and Arbour were delighted. The close proximity of the two fossils at Muir Creek suggested they may have come from the same individual.</p><p>罗利切克说，桑托克的一个化石发现，部分肩胛骨有细微骨折，这是一个独特的挑战。桑托克从岩石中取出化石后，用石膏将其固定，以防损坏。外壳很好地保护了标本，但它永久性地隐藏了一面，使化石难以识别。但桑托克的现场记录包含了一条重要线索：在肩胛骨碎片附近，律师发现了一块化石阿特拉斯——一头鲸鱼颅骨底部的脊椎。当Rohlicek和Arbour通过视频通话向Pyenson展示这些标本时，他立刻认出了化石地图集外缘的小突起。它们是古代河豚的骨骼特征。罗利切克和阿尔布尔很高兴。穆尔溪的两块化石非常接近，这表明它们可能来自同一个人。</p><p>   River dolphins are cetaceans, and the earliest species seem to have thrived in salt water before they eventually shifted into river habitats. Today, river dolphins are found in the warm waters of South America as well as various river systems in Asia, but during the Oligocene, some species clearly inhabited the cold waters of the northeast Pacific.</p><p>河豚是鲸类动物，最早的物种似乎是在咸水中繁衍生息，然后才最终转移到河流栖息地。如今，在南美洲的温暖水域以及亚洲的各种河流系统中都能发现河豚，但在渐新世期间，一些物种显然居住在太平洋东北部的寒冷水域。</p><p> As the research progressed, Arbour and Rohlicek identified two additional groups of cetaceans among the fossil bones in the Muir Creek collection: a  Basilosaurus and a possible member of the genus  Aetiocetus, which includes small baleen whales that had yet to lose their teeth. A pair of mystery vertebrae still partially embedded in rock—and a few other backbones in the collection—seemed to be of the same general size and shape as those thought to belong to aetiocetids and described in publications by other researchers. But that was just a hypothesis. Paleontologists had studied the distinctive skulls of aetiocetids but they had yet to fully describe other parts of the skeleton, and Rohlicek and Arbour didn’t have a skull to guide them.</p><p>随着研究的进展，阿尔布尔和罗利切克在缪尔溪收集的化石化石中发现了另外两组鲸类：一组是Basilosaurus，另一组可能是Aetiocetus属的成员，其中包括尚未失去牙齿的小须鲸。一对仍然部分嵌在岩石中的神秘椎骨和收藏中的其他几根脊骨，似乎与其他研究人员在出版物中描述的被认为属于病原体的椎骨具有相同的大小和形状。但这只是一个假设。古生物学家曾研究过古鲸类独特的头骨，但他们还没有完全描述骨骼的其他部分，罗利切克和阿尔布尔也没有头骨来指导他们。</p><p> But a fossil whale skeleton sitting nearly 4,000 kilometers away in Pyenson’s lab in Washington, DC, held hope for clinching the identification of the mystery vertebrae.</p><p>但在华盛顿特区的皮恩森实验室里，一具近4000公里外的鲸鱼骨骼化石为确定这种神秘脊椎动物的身份带来了希望。</p><p>  The Smithsonian Institution is home to the largest collection of whale fossils in the world. Examples of nearly every lineage of whale can be found at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) in Washington, DC, or in the museum’s storage facility in nearby Maryland.</p><p>史密森学会收藏了世界上最大的鲸鱼化石。在华盛顿特区的史密森尼国家自然历史博物馆（NMNH）或附近马里兰州的博物馆储存设施中，可以找到几乎所有鲸鱼谱系的例子。</p><p> “The Smithsonian preserves how the world once was,” Pyenson says on a balmy October morning, after rushing in a few minutes late for our appointment at the NMNH. The blue-eyed paleontologist has taken part in scientific expeditions to every continent on Earth, including Antarctica, but today, attired in dress shoes and a collared shirt despite the stifling humidity, he would blend in with many of the city’s politicians and executives. Indeed, on a crowded sidewalk, Washington’s elite would have no idea they’re standing next to one of the leading authorities on whale evolution.</p><p>“史密森学会保留了过去的世界，”在10月一个温暖的早晨，皮恩森说，他赶了几分钟才赶来参加我们在NMNH的会面。这位蓝眼睛的古生物学家参加了对地球上每一个大陆的科学考察，包括南极洲，但今天，尽管天气闷热，他还是穿着正装鞋和有领衬衫，与该市的许多政客和高管融为一体。事实上，在拥挤的人行道上，华盛顿的精英们根本不知道他们站在鲸鱼进化方面的一位权威人士旁边。</p><p> Pyenson leads the way through the exhibits and down to the laboratories and offices. As we cross the Sant Ocean Hall, he pauses under a cast of an early whale with four legs,  Maiacetus, which hangs from the ceiling. As I gaze at the doglike skeleton in wonder, he points out a second huge cetacean suspended nearby:  Basilosaurus, the giant eel-shaped whale that Rohlicek identified in the Muir Creek collection.</p><p>皮恩森带领大家穿过展品，来到实验室和办公室。当我们穿过圣海洋大厅时，他在一头早期的四条腿鲸鱼Maiacetus的石膏下停了下来，这头鲸鱼悬挂在天花板上。当我惊奇地注视着这具狗一样的骨架时，他指出了另一种悬浮在附近的巨大鲸类：Basilosaurus，这是Rohlicek在Muir Creek收藏中发现的一种巨大的鳗鱼形鲸鱼。</p><p>  The 19th-century founders of natural history museums could not have imagined the amount of damage that humans would wreak on the world’s ecosystems, and all that would be lost because of this, Pyenson says. They merely collected everything they could. Over the years, curators at the Smithsonian’s 11 museums have added about 145 million specimens and other objects to the collection—from fossils and shells to modern art and space shuttles. As Pyenson peers over his mask—which is emblazoned with a graphic visualizing the global average temperature rise over the last 150 years—he says we need such records of past worlds. Museums not only protect the past; they can help us navigate the challenges of the present and future. “Sea level change, ocean acidification, and habitat loss—those are all features that we see through geologic time,” he says, “and we’re living through them in human lifetimes.” Learning how ancient whales adapted in the past can provide context for how they’ll fare in the future. “The story of what will happen has been written before,” he</p><p>皮恩森说，19世纪自然历史博物馆的创立者无法想象人类会对世界生态系统造成多大的破坏，以及由此造成的所有损失。他们只是尽可能地收集一切。多年来，史密森学会的11个博物馆的策展人在收藏中增加了约1.45亿件标本和其他物品，从化石和贝壳到现代艺术和航天飞机。当皮恩森凝视着他的面具时，他说我们需要这些过去世界的记录。他的面具上有一个图形，显示了过去150年来全球平均气温的上升。博物馆不仅保护过去；它们可以帮助我们应对当前和未来的挑战。“海平面变化、海洋酸化和栖息地丧失——这些都是我们在地质时期看到的特征，”他说，“我们在人类的一生中都经历过它们。”了解古代鲸鱼如何适应过去可以为它们未来的生活提供背景。“关于将要发生的事情的故事以前就有人写过，”他说</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/悬崖/">#悬崖</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/cliff/">#cliff</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/化石/">#化石</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
