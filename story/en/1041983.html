A biochemist at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), Karikó had dedicated much of the previous two decades to finding a way to turn one of the most fundamental building blocks of life, mRNA, into a whole new category of therapeutics.</p><p>1995年，KatalinKarikó处于最低潮。卡里科（Karikó）是宾夕法尼亚大学（UPenn）的一名生物化学家，在过去的二十年中，他一直致力于寻找一种方法，将最基本的生命构成要素之一mRNA转变为一种全新的疗法。</p><p> More often than not, Karikó found herself hitting dead ends. Numerous grant applications were rejected, and an attempt to raise funding from venture capitalists in New York to form a spin-off company had proved to be a fruitless endeavour. ”They initially promised to give us money, but then they never returned my phone calls,” she says.</p><p> Karikó经常发现自己陷入僵局。许多赠款申请被拒绝，并且试图从纽约的风险资本家筹集资金以成立一家分拆公司的尝试被证明是徒劳的。她说：“他们最初承诺给我们钱，但后来他们再也没有回我的电话。”</p><p>  By the mid 1990s, Karikó’s bosses at UPenn had run out of patience. Frustrated with the lack of funding she was generating for her research, they offered the scientist a bleak choice: leave or be demoted. It was a demeaning prospect for someone who had once been on the path to a full professorship. For Karikó’s dreams of using mRNA to create new vaccines and drugs for many chronic illnesses, it seemed to be the end of the road.</p><p>  到1990年代中期，卡里科（Karikó）在UPenn的老板们已经失去了耐心。她为自己的研究缺乏资金而感到沮丧，他们为这位科学家提供了一个荒凉的选择：离开还是被降职。对于曾经去过正式教授职位的人来说，这是一个可耻的前景。对于卡里科（Karikó）的梦想，即使用mRNA来为许多慢性疾病开发新的疫苗和药物，这似乎已经走到了尽头。</p><p> Thirty four years earlier, the discovery of mRNA had been announced amidst a clamour of scientific excitement in the summer of 1961. For more than a decade, researchers in the US and Europe had been attempting to unravel exactly how DNA is involved in the creation of proteins – the long strings of amino acids that are vital to the growth and functioning of all life forms.</p><p> 三十四年前，在1961年夏天，人们在科学兴奋的喧嚣声中宣布了mRNA的发现。十多年来，美国和欧洲的研究人员一直在试图弄清DNA如何参与到DNA的创建中。蛋白质–一长串氨基酸，对所有生命形式的生长和功能至关重要。</p><p>  It transpired that mRNA was the answer. These molecules act like digital tape recorders, repeatedly copying instructions from DNA in the cell nucleus, and carrying them to protein-making structures called ribosomes. Without this key role, DNA would be nothing but a useless string of chemicals, and so some have dubbed mRNA the ‘software of life.’</p><p>  事实证明，mRNA是答案。这些分子就像数字磁带录音机一样，反复复制细胞核中DNA的指令，并将其携带到称为核糖体的蛋白质制造结构中。没有这种关键作用，DNA只会是无用的一连串化学物质，因此有些人将mRNA称为“生活软件”。</p><p> At the time the nine scientists credited with discovering mRNA were purely interested in solving a basic biological mystery, but by the 1970s the scientific world had begun to wonder if it could exploit this cellular messaging system to turn our bodies into medicine-making factories.</p><p> 当时，九位因发现mRNA而著称的科学家纯粹是对解决基本的生物学奥秘感兴趣，但到1970年代，科学界开始怀疑它是否可以利用这种细胞信息系统将我们的身体变成制药厂。</p><p>  Artificial mRNA, designed and created in a petri dish and then delivered to the cells of sick patients through tiny packages called nanoparticles, offered a way of instructing the body to heal itself. Research groups around the world began looking into whether mRNA could be used to create the vaccines of the future by delivering messages to cells, teaching them to create specific antibodies to fight off a viral infection. Others started investigating whether mRNA could help the immune system recognise and destroy cancerous tissue.</p><p>  人工mRNA是在皮氏培养皿中设计和制造的，然后通过称为纳米颗粒的小包装传递到患病患者的细胞中，提供了一种指导身体自我修复的方法。全世界的研究小组开始研究是否可以通过向细胞传递信息，教导它们产生特异性抗体来抵抗病毒感染来使用mRNA来制造未来的疫苗。其他人开始研究mRNA是否可以帮助免疫系统识别和破坏癌组织。 </p><p> Karikó was first exposed to these ideas as an undergraduate student in 1976, during a lecture at the University of Szeged in her native Hungary. Intrigued, she began a PhD, studying how mRNA might be used to target viruses. While the concept of gene therapy was also beginning to take off at the same time, capturing the imagination of many scientists, she felt mRNA had the potential to help many more people.</p><p>卡里科（Karikó）于1976年作为一名本科生在她的家乡匈牙利塞格德大学（University of Szeged）的一次演讲中首次接触到这些想法。她很感兴趣，开始了博士学位，研究如何将mRNA用于靶向病毒。虽然基因疗法的概念也同时开始兴起，吸引了许多科学家的想象，但她感到mRNA有潜力帮助更多人。</p><p> “I always thought that the majority of patients don’t actually need new genes, they need something temporary like a drug, to cure their aches and pains,” she said. “So mRNA was always more interesting to me.”</p><p> 她说：“我一直认为，大多数患者实际上并不需要新基因，他们需要暂时性的药物（例如药物）来治疗疼痛。” “因此，mRNA总是对我更有趣。”</p><p>  At the time, the technology required to make such grand ambitions a reality did not yet exist. While scientists knew how to isolate mRNA from cells, creating artificial forms was not possible. But in 1984, the American biochemist Kary Mullis invented polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a method of amplifying very small amounts of DNA so it can be studied in detail. By 1989, other researchers had found a way to utilise PCR to generate mRNA from scratch, by amplifying DNA strands and using an enzyme called RNA polymerase to create mRNA molecules from these strands. “For scientists working on mRNA, this was very empowering,” said Karikó. “Suddenly we felt like we could do anything.”</p><p>  当时，实现这种宏伟雄心所需的技术还不存在。尽管科学家们知道如何从细胞中分离出mRNA，但无法创造出人工形式。但是在1984年，美国生物化学家Kary Mullis发明了聚合酶链反应（PCR），一种扩增非常少量DNA的方法，因此可以对其进行详细研究。到1989年，其他研究人员发现了一种利用PCR的方法，通过扩增DNA链并使用一种称为RNA聚合酶的酶从这些链产生mRNA分子的方式，从头开始生成mRNA。 Karikó说：“对于研究mRNA的科学家来说，这非常有力量。” “突然之间，我们觉得自己无所不能。”</p><p>  With an mRNA boom taking place on the other side of the Atlantic, Karikó decided it was time to leave Hungary and head for the US. So in 1985, she accepted a job at Temple University and moved to Philadelphia along with her husband, two year old daughter, and a teddy bear with £900 sewn into it – the proceeds from the sale of their car on the black market.</p><p>  随着大西洋另一端的mRNA繁荣兴起，卡里科（Karikó）决定是时候离开匈牙利前往美国了。因此，在1985年，她接受了坦普尔大学的一份工作，并与丈夫，两岁的女儿和一只泰迪熊一起被缝制到了费城，泰迪熊缝了900英镑，这是他们在黑市上出售汽车的收益。</p><p> It did not take long for the American dream to sour. After four years, she was forced to leave Temple University for neighbouring UPenn after a dispute with her boss, who then attempted to have her deported. There she began working on mRNA therapies which could be used to improve blood vessel transplants, by producing proteins to keep the newly transplanted vessels alive.</p><p> 美国梦没多久就变了。四年后，在与老板发生纠纷后，她被迫离开坦普尔大学，去了附近的UPenn，后者随后试图将她驱逐出境。在那里，她开始从事mRNA疗法的研究，该疗法可通过产生蛋白质使新移植的血管保持生命来改善血管移植。</p><p> However, by the early to mid 1990s, some of the early excitement surrounding mRNA was beginning to fade. While scientists had cracked the problem of how to create their own mRNA, a new hurdle had emerged. When they injected it into animals it induced such a severe inflammatory response from the immune system that they died immediately. Any thoughts of human trials were impossible.</p><p> 然而，到1990年代初至中期，围绕mRNA的某些早期兴奋开始逐渐消失。当科学家们破解了如何创建自己的mRNA的问题时，出现了新的障碍。当他们将其注射到动物体内时，它会从免疫系统引起严重的炎症反应，从而立即死亡。任何人类试验的想法都是不可能的。</p><p> This was a serious problem, but one Karikó was determined to solve. She recalls spending one Christmas and New Year’s Eve conducting experiments and writing grant applications. But many other scientists were turning away from the field, and her bosses at UPenn felt mRNA had shown itself to be impractical and she was wasting her time. They issued an ultimatum, if she wanted to continue working with mRNA she would lose her prestigious faculty position, and face a substantial pay cut.</p><p> 这是一个严重的问题，但一个Karikó决心解决。她回想起圣诞节和除夕花了一个时间进行实验并撰写了赠款申请。但是许多其他科学家正在远离该领域，而她在UPenn的老板们认为mRNA证明自己是不切实际的，并且浪费了时间。他们发出了最后通,，如果她想继续从事mRNA的研究，她将失去她享有声望的教职，并面临大幅减薪。 </p><p>  ”It was particularly horrible as that same week, I had just been diagnosed with cancer,” said Karikó. “I was facing two operations, and my husband, who had gone back to Hungary to pick up his green card, had got stranded there because of some visa issue, meaning he couldn’t come back for six months. I was really struggling, and then they told me this.”</p><p>卡里科说：“就在同一周，我刚刚被诊断出患有癌症，这特别可怕。” “我面临两次手术，而回匈牙利去领绿卡的丈夫因签证问题而被困在那里，这意味着他六个月无法回来。我真的很挣扎，然后他们告诉了我。”</p><p> While undergoing surgery, Karikó assessed her options. She decided to stay, accept the humiliation of being demoted, and continue to doggedly pursue the problem. This led to a chance meeting which would both change the course of her career, and that of science.</p><p> 在接受手术期间，卡里科（Karikó）评估了她的选择。她决定留下来，接受被降级的耻辱，并继续顽强地追求这个问题。这导致了一次机会会议，这将改变她的职业生涯以及科学生涯。</p><p> In 1997, Drew Weissman, a respected immunologist, moved to UPenn. This was long before the days where scientific publications were available online, and so the only way for scientists to peruse the latest research was to photocopy it from journals. “I found myself fighting over a photocopy machine in the department with this scientist called Katalin Karikó,” he remembered. ”So we started talking, and comparing what each other did.”</p><p> 1997年，受人尊敬的免疫学家Drew Weissman移居到UPenn。这早于可以在线获取科学出版物的时代之前，因此科学家细读最新研究的唯一方法是从期刊上复印。他回忆说：“我发现自己在这个部门与一位名叫KatalinKarikó的科学家在复印机上作斗争。” “因此，我们开始交谈，并比较彼此的所作所为。”</p><p> While Karikó’s academic status at UPenn remained lowly, Weissman had the funding to finance her experiments, and the two began a partnership. “This gave me optimism, and kept me going,” she said. “My salary was lower than the technician who worked next to me, but Drew was supportive and that’s what I concentrated on, not the roadblocks I’d had to face.”</p><p> 卡里科（Karikó）在UPenn的学业地位仍然很低，但魏斯曼（Weissman）有资金资助她的实验，两人开始了合作。她说：“这让我感到乐观，并使我继续前进。” “我的薪水低于我旁边工作的技术人员，但是Drew给予了支持，这就是我所关注的，而不是我必须面对的障碍。”</p><p> Karikó and Weissman realised that the key to creating a form of mRNA which could be administered safely, was to identify which of the underlying nucleosides – the letters of RNA’s genetic code – were provoking the immune system and replace them with something else. In the early 2000s, Karikó happened across a study which showed that one of these letters, Uridine, could trigger certain immune receptors. It was the crucial piece of information she had been searching for.</p><p> 卡里科（Karikó）和韦斯曼（Weissman）意识到，创造一种可以安全管理的mRNA形式的关键是确定哪些潜在的核苷（RNA的遗传密码）刺激了免疫系统，并用其他物质取代了它们。在2000年代初期，Karikó发生在一项研究中，该研究表明其中一个字母尿苷可以触发某些免疫受体。这是她一直在寻找的关键信息。</p><p>  In 2005, Karikó and Weissman published a study announcing a specifically modified form of mRNA, which replaced Uridine with an analog – a molecule which looked the same, but did not induce an immune response. It was a clever biological trick, and one which worked. When mice were injected with this modified mRNA, they lived. “I just remember Drew saying, ’Oh my god, it’s not immunogenic,’” said Karikó. “We realised at that moment that this would be very important, and it could be used in vaccines and therapies. So we published a paper, filed a patent, established a company, and then found there was no interest. Nobody invited us anywhere to talk about it, nothing.”</p><p>  2005年，Karikó和Weissman发表了一项研究，宣布了一种特定修饰的mRNA形式，该形式用类似物取代了尿苷，该类似物看起来相同，但不会诱导免疫反应。这是一个聪明的生物技巧，而且有效。给小鼠注射这种修饰的mRNA后，它们就活了下来。卡里科说：“我只记得德鲁说，‘噢，天哪，这不是免疫原性的’。” “我们当时意识到这将非常重要，并且可以用于疫苗和疗法。因此，我们发表了论文，申请了专利，成立了公司，然后发现没有兴趣。没有人邀请我们到任何地方谈论它，什么都没有。”</p><p> Unbeknown to them, however, some scientists were paying attention. Derrick Rossi, then a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University, read Karikó and Weissman’s paper and was immediately intrigued. In 2010, Rossi co-founded a biotech company called Moderna, with a group of Harvard and MIT professors, with the specific aim of using modified mRNA to create vaccines and therapeutics. A decade on, Moderna is now one of the leaders in the Covid-19 vaccine race and valued at approximately $35 billion (£26b), after reporting that its mRNA based vaccine showed 94 per cent efficacy in a Phase III clinical trial.</p><p> 然而，他们不为人所知，一些科学家正在关注。当时斯坦福大学的博士后研究员德里克·罗西（Derrick Rossi）阅读了卡里科（Karikó）和魏斯曼（Weissman）的论文，并立即对此产生了兴趣。 2010年，罗西（Rossi）与一群哈佛大学和麻省理工学院的教授共同创立了一家名为Moderna的生物技术公司，其具体目标是使用修饰的mRNA来生产疫苗和治疗剂。十年过去了，Moderna现已成为Covid-19疫苗竞赛的领导者之一，价值约350亿美元（26b英镑），此前该公司报道其基于mRNA的疫苗在III期临床试验中显示出94％的功效。 </p><p> But it was not novel infectious disease vaccines which got the world interested in mRNA again. Around the same time, Rossi was establishing Moderna, Karikó and Weissman were also finally managing to commercialise their finding, licensing their technology to a small German company called BioNTech, after five years of trying and failing.</p><p>但是并不是新型的传染病疫苗再次引起了世界对mRNA的兴趣。大约在同一时间，罗西（Rossi）建立了Moderna，卡里科（Karikó）和魏斯曼（Weissman）也终于设法将他们的发现商业化，经过五年的尝试和失败，将其技术授权给一家名为BioNTech的德国小型公司。</p><p> Both Moderna and BioNTech – which had been founded by a Turkish born entrepreneur called Ugur Sahin - had their eye on the lucrative fields of cancer immunotherapy, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Now that Karikó and Weissman’s discovery made it possible to safely administer mRNA to patients, some of the original goals for mRNA back in the 1970s, had become viable possibilities again.</p><p> 由土耳其出生的企业家Ugur Sahin创立的Moderna和BioNTech都将目光投向了利润丰厚的癌症免疫疗法，心血管疾病和代谢性疾病领域。如今，Karikó和Weissman的发现使得可以安全地对患者使用mRNA，早在1970年代就实现了mRNA的最初目标，如今又成为可行的可能性。</p><p> Vaccines were also on the horizon. In 2017, Moderna began developing a potential Zika virus vaccine, while in 2018 BioNTech entered into a partnership with Pfizer to develop mRNA vaccines for influenza, although the large scale funding which drives vaccine projects was still nowhere to be seen.</p><p> 疫苗也即将出现。 2017年，Moderna开始开发潜在的Zika病毒疫苗，而2018年，BioNTech与辉瑞（Pfizer）建立了合作伙伴关系，共同开发用于流感的mRNA疫苗，尽管驱动疫苗项目的大规模资金仍无处可寻。</p><p>  That has all changed in 2020. With the Covid-19 pandemic requiring vaccine development on an unprecedented scale, mRNA vaccine approaches held a clear advantage over the more traditional but time consuming method of using a dead or inactivated form of the virus to create an immune response. In April, Moderna received $483 million (£360m) from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to fasttrack its Covid-19 vaccine program.</p><p>  到2020年，这一切都发生了变化。随着Covid-19大流行需要前所未有的规模开发疫苗，mRNA疫苗方法比使用死或灭活形式的病毒来产生免疫力的更传统但耗时的方法具有明显的优势。响应。今年4月，Moderna从美国生物医学高级研究与开发管理局获得了4.83亿美元（3.6亿英镑）的资金，以快速跟踪其Covid-19疫苗计划。</p><p> Karikó has been at the helm of BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine development. In 2013, she accepted an offer to become Senior Vice President at BioNTech after UPenn refused to reinstate her to the faculty position she had been demoted from in 1995. “They told me that they’d had a meeting and concluded that I was not of faculty quality,” she said. ”When I told them I was leaving, they laughed at me and said, ‘BioNTech doesn’t even have a website.’”</p><p> Karikó一直是BioNTech Covid-19疫苗开发的负责人。 2013年，在UPenn拒绝恢复她于1995年被降职的教职之后，她接受了成为BioNTech高级副总裁的邀请。“他们告诉我说，他们开会了，得出的结论是我不是教师素质，”她说。 “当我告诉他们我要离开的时候，他们嘲笑我，说，‘BioNTech甚至没有网站。’”</p><p> Now, BioNTech is a household name, following reports last month that the mRNA Covid-19 vaccine it has co-developed with Pfizer works with more than 95 per cent efficacy. Along with Moderna, it is set to supply billions of doses around the globe by the end of 2021.</p><p> 现在，BioNTech已是家喻户晓的名字，此前上个月有报道称，它与辉瑞公司共同开发的mRNA Covid-19疫苗的功效超过95％。到2021年底，它将与Moderna一起向全球提供数十亿剂。</p><p> For Karikó, seeing the results of BioNTech’s Phase III trial, simply brought a sense of quiet satisfaction. “I didn’t jump or scream,” she said. “I expected that it would be very effective.”</p><p> 对于Karikó而言，看到BioNTech的III期临床试验的结果，只是带来了一种安静的满足感。她说：“我没有跳或尖叫。” “我希望它会非常有效。” </p><p> But after so many years of adversity, and struggling to convince people that her research was worthwhile, she is still trying to comprehend the fact that her breakthrough in mRNA technology could now change the lives of billions around the world, and help end the global pandemic.</p><p>但是在经历了这么多年的逆境之后，她努力使人们相信她的研究是值得的，但她仍在努力理解这一事实，即她在mRNA技术上的突破现在可以改变全世界数十亿人的生活，并有助于结束全球大流行。</p><p>  “I always wanted to help people, to try and get something into the clinic,” she said. “That was the motivation for me, and I was always optimistic. But to help that many people, I never imagined that. It makes me very happy to know that I’ve played a part in this success story.”</p><p>  她说：“我一直想帮助人们，尝试使某些东西进入诊所。” “这是我的动力，我一直都很乐观。但是为了帮助那么多人，我从未想象过。知道自己在这个成功故事中发挥了作用，这让我感到非常高兴。”</p><p>   ❤️ It’s tempting to share passwords with you partner  but you should stop</p><p>   ❤️很想与您的伴侣共享密码，但是您应该停止</p><p> 📧 Nigerian Prince email scams have a long legacy,  including boosting the growth of a notorious police unit</p><p> 📧尼日利亚王子电子邮件诈骗案源远流长，其中包括促进臭名昭著的警察部队的发展</p><p>  🔊  Listen to The WIRED Podcast, the week in science, technology and culture,  delivered every Friday</p><p>  🔊收听每个星期五播报的科学，技术和文化周《有线》播客</p><p>  The WIRED World in 2021 is an unmissable briefing on the ideas, trends, technologies, people and companies that will shape the coming year.</p><p>  2021年《有线世界》是有关将影响来年的想法，趋势，技术，人员和公司的必不可少的简报。</p><p>  Buy it now</p><p>  现在购买 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/mrna-coronavirus-vaccine-pfizer-biontech">https://www.wired.co.uk/article/mrna-coronavirus-vaccine-pfizer-biontech</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/压碎/">#压碎</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/mrna/">#mrna</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
