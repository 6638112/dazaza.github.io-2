This eventually leads to a feeling of burnout. Over the years, I\u2019ve learned that I\u2019m not alone. In fact, in a recent Gallup study,  44% of people reported feeling burned out sometimes.\n Today, I\u2019m going to tell my story of burnout and how I know when I\u201dm reaching my limit. In the next two posts, I\u2019ll explain some techniques that have helped me recover and share how I avoid sliding back into burnout.\n  As a kid, I took art lessons for nearly ten years. I went every single week \u2014 until I turned seventeen, that is.\n At seventeen, I was taking AP classes, dual-enrolled in the local community college, on my high school\u2019s debate team, taking horseback riding lessons, working a part-time job, and still going to my art lessons every week. I had overloaded myself so much that everything I once loved felt like a chore. I was so exhausted and overwhelmed that I simply stopped going to my art lessons. I didn\u2019t call and explain the situation. I didn\u2019t say goodbye to the instructor I had spent the last ten years with. I just stopped showing up.\n I am not proud of seventeen-year-old Sarah\u2019s actions. However, it was an important life lesson for me. It turns out I can\u2019t do  everything. And when I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed, I need to intervene and make a change for myself. This was the first time I experienced burnout.\n I\u2019d love to say I figured out how to avoid burnout altogether after the \u201cart lesson incident,\u201d but that would be false. I\u2019ve experienced it time and time again. It seems to be a cyclical pattern in my life.\n Because I\u2019ve dug myself out of burnout more times than I\u2019d like to admit, it\u2019s become a strange skill of mine. I\u2019ve picked up some techniques for reclaiming my life after experiencing it. More importantly, though, over the past few years, I\u2019ve focused on how to avoid falling into burnout altogether. I\u2019ll talk about those over the next two weeks.\n   The following are the signs of burnout that I keep an eye out for. When I see them, I know I need to make a change. Hopefully, these tells will resonate with you as well.\n  When I\u2019m burned out, I\u2019m not the most pleasant person to be around. I tend to get irritated at things no human honestly should. I have a harder time regulating my emotions and generally feel uncomfortable for the majority of my day.\n This is when I find myself fantasizing about spending large spans of time completely alone.\n  I like to be busy. In fact, my friends and family have been joking about my inability to sit still and relax for as long as I can remember. However, when I\u2019m feeling burned out, I start to dread the things I once looked forward to. Fun hobbies start to feel like an irritating chore.\n This is when I find myself longing to sit on the couch and do absolutely nothing.\n  Like most humans, I prefer to be in control of my life. I get frustrated when I feel as if I don\u2019t have the ability to choose my own path or even influence it. When I\u2019m feeling burned out, I feel trapped \u2014 as if I have no way out of the non-ideal situations I find myself in.\n   Burnout impacts me physically as well as mentally. I\u2019ve never been a great sleeper. When I\u2019m feeling burned out, this problem is exacerbated. I often find myself waking up at odd hours of the night, worrying about things that are not even significant or in my control.\n Additionally, high levels of stress coupled with less sleep is a surefire path to headaches. For me, these headaches typically manifest as tension and pressure around my eyes, jaw, and forehead.\n   Every person experiences life differently, so of course, each person\u2019s experiences with burnout will vary as well. Maybe some of my telltale signs of burnout resonate with you. Maybe yours are completely different \u2014 if so, I\u2019d love to hear about them in the comments!\n Next Thursday, I\u2019ll talk about how to pull yourself out of a state of burnout.", "posttime":

"note_en": "Millions of people are being pushed towards hunger by the coronavirus pandemic, which could end up killing more people through lack of food than from the illness itself,  Oxfam has warned.\n Closed borders, curfews and travel restrictions have disrupted food supplies and incomes in already fragile countries, forcing an extra million people closer to famine in  Afghanistan and heightening the humanitarian disaster in Yemen, where two-thirds already live in hunger.\n One million more people are facing famine in Afghanistan as a result of coronavirus, according to a report from the charity. The number of people on the brink of famine in the country rose sharply from 2.5 million last September to 3.5 million in May, the result of border closures and the economic downturn in neighbouring Iran that caused a drop in home remittances by overseas workers.\n  Oxfam said that up to 12,000 people could die from hunger every day globally \u2013 2,000 more than died from Covid-19 each day in April.\n Along with Afghanistan, the charity identified Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Venezuela, the west African Sahel, Ethiopia, Sudan,  South Sudan, Syria, and Haiti as extreme hunger hotspots.\n \u201cThe knock-on impacts of Covid-19 are far more widespread than the virus itself, pushing millions of the world\u2019s poorest people deeper into hunger and  poverty. It is vital governments contain the spread of this deadly disease, but they must also prevent it killing as many \u2013 if not more \u2013 people from hunger,\u201d said the chief executive of Oxfam GB, Danny Sriskandarajah.\n \u201cFor many people, Covid-19 comes as a crisis on top of a crisis. To break the cycle of hunger, governments must build fairer and more sustainable food systems that ensure small-scale producers and workers earn a living wage.\u201d\n Oxfam said countries with existing problems, such as South Sudan and Syria, were already seeing  hunger worsen but there was also concern for middle-income countries such as India and Brazil.\n Mass unemployment was affecting all countries, but informal labourers were suffering the most, often unable to travel to work.\n Travel restrictions were also hitting food supplies by preventing farmers from hiring workers and small-scale producers from accessing their own fields.\n The report said the virus was  heightening the humanitarian disaster in Yemen, where two-thirds of people already have inadequate food.\n Remittances from Yemeni workers abroad had dropped by 80% \u2013 $253m (\u00a3200m) \u2013 in the first four months of 2020 as a result of job losses across the Gulf region. The closure of supply routes has led to food shortages and food price hikes in the country, which imports 90% of its food.\n Salem Jaffer Baobaid, Yemeni spokesman for Islamic Relief, said the war in  Yemen had destroyed the country\u2019s economy, forcing many into day labour rather than secure jobs.\n \u201cThis pandemic has obliged people to stay at home. This has made life very difficult for people who are meeting their needs on a daily basis,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pandemic has affected even the basic life cycle and the suffering of the people has increased.\u201d\n  Islamic Relief warned that even though food and fuel prices had spiked in recent weeks, the international community had failed to meet funding goals for Yemen. Baobaid said the result was more families having to beg on the streets.\n \u201cThe global humanitarian community need to pay attention to the situation in Yemen. It\u2019s not long before we can slide into a catastrophic humanitarian situation,\u201d he said.\n The UN World Food Programme, which estimates that the number of people facing severe hunger will increase by about 122 million this year as a result of the pandemic, cut food deliveries by almost half in northern Yemen. Oxfam said humanitarian assistance around the world had been curtailed by restrictions on movement and other precautions to prevent the virus spreading.\n The Oxfam report said only 9% of funding for tackling food security had been met under then UN\u2019s global fund against Covid-19.\n  Oxfam has called for more money to fight hunger caused by the pandemic, and pushed for the cancellation of debt owed by poor countries when G20 finance ministers meet next week.\n Oxfam also highlighted a crisis in Africa\u2019s Sahel region, where at least 4 million people have been displaced by extreme climate conditions that were damaging crops, causing greater tension between communities sharing resources.", "posttime": "2020-07-10 01:07:36", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name":

"note_en": "On June 21, Cloudflare automatically mitigated a highly volumetric DDoS attack that peaked at 754 million packets per second. The attack was part of an organized four day campaign starting on June 18 and ending on June 21: attack traffic was sent from over 316,000 IP addresses towards a single Cloudflare IP address that was mostly used for websites on our Free plan. No downtime or service degradation was reported during the attack, and no charges accrued to customers due to our  unmetered mitigation guarantee.\n The attack was detected and handled automatically by  Gatebot, our global DDoS detection and mitigation system without any manual intervention by our teams. Notably, because our automated systems were able to mitigate the attack without issue, no alerts or pages were sent to our on-call teams and no humans were involved at all.\n  During those four days, the attack utilized a combination of three attack vectors over the  TCP protocol:  SYN floods,  ACK floods and SYN-ACK floods. The attack campaign sustained for multiple hours at rates exceeding 400-600 million packets per second and peaked multiple times above 700 million packets per second, with a top peak of 754 million packets per second. Despite the high and sustained packet rates, our edge continued serving our customers during the attack without impacting performance at all\n  Attacks with high bits per second rates aim to saturate the Internet link by sending more bandwidth per second than the link can handle. Mitigating a bit-intensive flood is similar to a dam blocking gushing water in a canal with limited capacity, allowing just a portion through.\n  In such cases, the Internet service provider may block or throttle the traffic above the allowance resulting in denial of service for legitimate users that are trying to connect to the website but are blocked by the service provider. In other cases, the link is simply saturated and everything behind that connection is offline.\n  However in this DDoS campaign, the attack peaked at a mere 250 Gbps (I say, mere, but \u00bc Tbps is enough to knock pretty much anything offline if it isn\u2019t behind some DDoS mitigation service) so it does not seem as the attacker intended to saturate our Internet links, perhaps because they know that our global capacity exceeds 37 Tbps. Instead, it appears the attacker attempted (and failed) to overwhelm our routers and data center appliances with high packet rates reaching 754 million packets per second. As opposed to water rushing towards a dam, flood of packets can be thought of as a swarm of millions of mosquitoes that you need to zap one by one.\n  Depending on the \u2018weakest link\u2019 in a data center, a packet intensive DDoS attack may impact the routers, switches, web servers, firewalls, DDoS mitigation devices or any other appliance that is used in-line. Typically, a high packet rate may cause the memory buffer to overflow and thus voiding the router\u2019s ability to process additional packets. This is because there\u2019s a small fixed CPU cost of handing each packet and so if you can send a lot of small packets you can block an Internet connection not by filling it but by causing the hardware that handles the connection to be overwhelmed with processing.\n Another form of DDoS attack is one with a high HTTP request per second rate. An HTTP request intensive DDoS attack aims to overwhelm a web server\u2019s resources with more HTTP requests per second than the server can handle. The goal of a DDoS attack with a high request per second rate is to max out the CPU and memory utilization of the server in order to crash it or prevent it from being able to respond to legitimate requests. Request intensive DDoS attacks allow the attacker to generate much less bandwidth, as opposed to bit intensive attacks, and still cause a denial of service.\n  So how did we handle 754 million packets per second? First, Cloudflare\u2019s network utilizes BGP Anycast to spread attack traffic globally across our fleet of data centers. Second, we built our own DDoS protection systems, Gatebot and dosd, which  drop packets inside the Linux kernel for maximum efficiency in order to handle massive floods of packets. And third, we built our own L4 load-balancer, Unimog, which uses our appliances&#39; health and other various metrics to load-balance traffic intelligently within a data center.\n In 2017, we published a blog introducing Gatebot, one of our two DDoS protection systems. The blog was titled  Meet Gatebot - a bot that allows us to sleep, and that\u2019s exactly what happened during this attack. The attack surface was spread out globally by our Anycast, then Gatebot detected and mitigated the attack automatically without human intervention. And traffic inside each datacenter was load-balanced intelligently to avoid overwhelming any one machine. And as promised in the blog title, the attack peak did in fact occur while our London team was asleep.\n So how does Gatebot work? Gatebot asynchronously samples traffic from every one of our data centers in over 200 locations around the world. It also monitors our  customers\u2019 origin server health. It then analyzes the samples to identify patterns and traffic anomalies that can indicate attacks. Once an attack is detected, Gatebot sends mitigation instructions to the edge data centers.\n To complement Gatebot, last year we released a new system codenamed dosd (denial of service daemon) which runs in every one of our data centers around the world in over 200 cities. Similarly to Gatebot, dosd detects and mitigates attacks autonomously but in the scope of a single server or data center. You can read more about dosd in our  recent blog.\n  While in recent months we\u2019ve observed a  decrease in the size and duration of DDoS attacks, highly volumetric and globally distributed DDoS attacks such as this one still persist. Regardless of the size, type or sophistication of the attack, Cloudflare offers  unmetered DDoS protection to all customers and plan levels\u2014including the Free plans.\n  DDoS  Security  Gatebot

"note_en": "Contracts are the foundation for any business, and getting good at negotiating and understanding these instruments is critical for any startup founder. Asking the right questions at just the right moment can be the difference between signing a deal today (and saving those legal fees!) and losing a deal and ending up in a courtroom in the Eastern District of Texas.\n Given how critical this skill is, we\u2019re excited to bring two seasoned and complementary attorneys to  TC Early Stage on July 21 &amp; 22 who are experts at the legal issues facing startups to offer their advice and answer your questions about how to think about business law and how to balance getting the right advice with the financial constraints of early-stage startups.\n  James Alonso is founder and partner at  Magnolia Law where he specializes in company formation, venture financing, and the law around scaling startups. Meanwhile, Adam Zagaris is the founder and partner of Moonshot Legal, where he specializes in startup laws around areas like commercial transactions, intellectual property, and human resources.\n Together, the two will go into all the different facets of the modern legal environment for startups, and help founders understand their role in the legal process. If you can save even 15 minutes of your lawyer\u2019s time in the future from their combined advice, you will already have paid for the entire entry fee for  TC Early Stage in the first place. So come join us and become an  interested party.\n TC Early Stage (July 21 and 22) has so much to offer. The show will bring together   50+ experts across startup core competencies , such as fundraising, operations and marketing. Cyan Bannister is set to explain how to get an investor to say yes to your startup. Asher Abramson will be sharing how to create growth assets for paid channels, lawyers James Alonso and Adam Zagaris will share how to draw up your first contracts, and Priti Choksi is hosting a session on how to get a company acquired rather than selling.\n The two-day show features more than 50 sessions, but don\u2019t worry; attendees will get access to the videos on demand for all of them. What\u2019s more, most of the speakers, who happen to be investors, are participating in TechCrunch\u2019s CrunchMatch, our platform that connects founders to investors based on shared interests.\n Here\u2019s the fine print. Each of the 50+ breakout sessions is limited to around 100 attendees. We expect a lot more attendees, of course, so signups for each session are on a first-come, first-serve basis.\n Buy your ticket today , and you can sign up for the breakouts we are announcing today, as well as those already published. Pass holders will also receive 24-hour advance notice before we announce the next batch. (And yes, you can \u201cdrop\u201d a breakout session in favor of a new one, in the event there is a schedule conflict.)\n Get your\u00a0  TC Early Stage pass today  and jump into the inside track on the sessions we announced so far, as well as the ones to be published in the coming weeks.", "posttime": "2020-07-10 00:48:16", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

"note_en": "We\u2019ve open-sourced Retrie, a code refactoring tool for Haskell that makes codemodding faster, easier, and safer. Using Retrie, developers can efficiently rewrite large codebases (exceeding 1 million lines), express rewrites as equations in Haskell syntax instead of regular expressions, and avoid large classes of codemodding errors.\n Retrie\u2019s features include the ability to rewrite expressions, types, and patterns; the ability to script rewrites and add side conditions; and a library for scripting more advanced rewrites. Retrie also respects and maintains local scoping, preserves white space, and does not rewrite code comments.\n  Refactoring improves the overall design of a codebase, but it can be a meticulous, time-consuming task. To avoid errors, refactoring is often done by hand, in small increments. As the size of a codebase grows, this approach becomes infeasible, and tool support is critical.\n In the spectrum of refactoring tools, there are two extremes. At one end, there are find-and-replace string manipulation tools, such as sed. These tools are fast, but it is difficult to express complicated rewrites. At the other end of the spectrum are tools for parsing and manipulating an abstract syntax tree (AST). AST manipulation tools are very powerful but require extensive domain knowledge and are typically slow compared with string replacement.\n Retrie occupies a comfortable middle ground. Expressing rewrites as equations in the syntax of the target language (in this case, Haskell) is easier than defining a complex regular expression or AST traversal. Since equations are more powerful than regular expressions and rewrites can be scripted, Retrie is more powerful than string replacement alone. Retrie also leverages several techniques to narrow the search space before parsing and efficiently finding matches, which makes it faster than typical AST manipulation tools.\n As an example of using Retrie, let\u2019s say you have some code, including functions like  foo:\n module MyModule where \rfoo :: [Int] -&gt; [Int] \rfoo ints = map bar (map baz ints)\n You realize that traversing the list  ints twice is slower than doing it just once.  Instead of fixing the code manually, you can express the transformation as an equation and apply it everywhere in the current directory:\n retrie --adhoc &#34;forall f g xs. map f (map g xs) = map (f . g) xs&#34;\n  module MyModule where \rfoo :: [Int] -&gt; [Int] \r-foo ints = map bar (map baz ints) \r+foo ints = map (bar . baz) ints\n  Haskell powers our anti-abuse rule engine,   Sigma . To manage the growing scale and complexity of rules, we   migrated Sigma to Haskell  in 2015. Sigma blocks spam, phishing attacks, and malware before they can affect people on Facebook.  Retrie has allowed us to quickly and safely migrate Sigma\u2019s rules to new APIs and libraries.

All of these improvements have the common goal of making it easier to find visual inspiration, learn new things, and get more done.\n  Starting this week, a new feature makes it easy to find quick facts about what you see on Google Images. When you search for an image on mobile in the U.S., you might see information from the  Knowledge Graph related to the result. That information would include people, places or things related to the image from the Knowledge Graph\u2019s database of billions of facts, helping you explore the topic more.\n  For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re searching for beautiful state parks to visit nearby. You want to swim during your visit, so you tap on a picture of a park with a river. Beneath the photo you might see related topics, such as the name of the river, or which city the park is in. If you tap a specific topic, it will expand and show you a short description of the person, place or thing it references, along with a link to learn more and other related topics for you to explore. With this information, you can better understand the image you\u2019re viewing and whether the web page is relevant to your search.", "posttime": "2020-07-10 00:46:18", "source_domain":

"note_en": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday recognized about half of Oklahoma as Native American reservation land and overturned a tribe member\u2019s rape conviction because the location where the crime was committed should have been considered outside the reach of state criminal law.\n  The justices ruled 5-4 in favor of a man named Jimcy McGirt and agreed that the site of the rape should have been recognized as part of a reservation based on the historical claim of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation - beyond the jurisdiction of state authorities. Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch joined the court\u2019s four liberals in the majority.\n The ruling means that for the first time much of eastern Oklahoma is legally considered reservation land. More than 1.8 million people live in the land at issue, including roughly 400,000 in Tulsa, Oklahoma\u2019s second-largest city.\n Tribe members who live within the boundaries are now set to become exempt from certain state obligations such as paying state taxes, while certain Native Americans found guilty in state courts may be able to challenge their convictions on jurisdictional grounds. The tribe also may obtain more power to regulate alcohol sales and expand casino gambling.\n The ruling could affect the other four of the \u201cFive Tribes\u201d in Oklahoma: the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw and Seminole tribes.\n The ruling voided McGirt\u2019s sentence of 1,000 years in prison but he could face a new trial in federal court rather than state court.\n Under U.S. law, tribe members who commit crimes on tribal land cannot be prosecuted in state courts and instead are subject to federal prosecution, which sometimes can be beneficial to defendants. Reservations were established beginning in the 19th century after U.S. authorities expelled Native Americans from their traditional lands.\n McGirt, 71, has served more than two decades in prison after being convicted in 1997 in Wagoner County in eastern Oklahoma of rape, lewd molestation and forcible sodomy of a 4-year-old girl. McGirt, who did not contest his guilt in the case before the justices, had appealed a 2019 ruling by a state appeals court in favor of Oklahoma.\n McGirt is a member of the Seminole Nation. The crime occurred on land historically claimed by the Creek Nation.\n At issue was whether the Muscogee (Creek) Nation territory where the crime was committed should be considered a Native American reservation or whether Congress eliminated that status around the time Oklahoma became a state in 1907.\n Oklahoma argued that the Creek Nation never had a reservation. But even if one existed, the state and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration argued it long ago was eliminated by Congress.\n The justices weighed a complex historical record that started with the forced relocation by the U.S. government of Native Americans, including the Creek Nation, to Oklahoma in a traumatic 19th century event known as the \u201ctrail of tears.\u201d\n A reservation is land managed by a tribe under the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs and generally exempt from state jurisdiction including taxation.", "posttime": "2020-07-10 00:45:45", "source_domain":

Sailer)\u3002\n.", "note_en": "On June 22nd, visitors to Slate Star Codex, a long-standing blog of considerable influence, discovered that the site\u2019s cerulean banner and graying WordPress design scheme had been superseded by a barren white layout. In the place of its usual catalogue of several million words of fiction, book reviews, essays, and miscellanea, as well as at least as voluminous an archive of reader commentary, was a single post of atypical brevity. \u201cSo,\u201d it began, \u201cI kind of deleted the blog. Sorry. Here\u2019s my explanation.\u201d The farewell post was attributed, like virtually all of the blog\u2019s entries since its inception, in 2013, to Scott Alexander, the pseudonym of a Bay Area psychiatrist\u2014the title \u201cSlate Star Codex\u201d is an imperfect anagram of the alias\u2014and it put forth a rationale for this online self-immolation.\n  \u201cLast week I talked to a  New York Times technology reporter who was planning to write a story on Slate Star Codex,\u201d the post continued. \u201cHe told me it would be a mostly positive piece about how we were an interesting gathering place for people in tech, and how we were ahead of the curve on some aspects of  the coronavirus situation.\u201d In early March, Alexander had suggested that his readers begin to prepare for potential catastrophe, and his extensive review of the available medical literature led him to the conclusion that, despite the early guidance by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the contrary, masks were likely to prove more useful than not. A month later, he looked back at his forecast and awarded himself a \u201csolid B-\u201d\u2014not perfect, but at least more accurate than the news media, which, with some notable exceptions, he wrote, \u201cnot only failed to adequately warn its readers about the epidemic, but actively mocked and condescended to anyone who  did sound a warning.\u201d Journalists, in his view, were guilty of an inability or a refusal to weight the possible outcomes. As he put it, if there was even a ten per cent risk of a ruinous pandemic, shouldn\u2019t that have been the headline? Alexander, who prefaces some of his own posts with an \u201cepistemic status,\u201d by which he rates his own confidence in the opinions to follow, thought the media, too, should present its findings in shades of gray.\n The final post went on, \u201cIt probably would have been a very nice article. Unfortunately, he told me he had discovered my real name and would reveal it in the article, ie doxx me.\u201d Alexander explained that he has a variety of reasons to prefer that his real name, which can be ascertained with minimal investigation, be left out of the paper of record. As a psychiatrist, he suspects that his relationships with his patients could be compromised if they were made aware of his \u201cpersonal\u201d blog, which gets six hundred thousand monthly page views. The site, and the community it undergirds, has found itself embroiled in various disputes, and his longtime readers would have understood why he wished he\u2019d done more to camouflage his identity. He also worries about the fate of his patients should the clinic for which he works decide to fire him. There was also, he added, the \u201cprosaic\u201d matter of his personal safety. One of his commenters had recently claimed to have been subject to a  ting, a dangerous prank in which a police   team is given false reason to descend with military force upon a victim\u2019s home. Alexander\u2019s living arrangement is communal, and his responsibility extended to his household. \u201cI live with ten housemates including a three-year-old and an infant,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand I would prefer this not happen to me or them.\u201d\n  Alexander\u2019s appeals to the reporter\u2019s conscience had been ineffective. \u201cHe said that it was  New York Times policy to include real names, and he couldn\u2019t change that,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAfter considering my options, I decided on the one you see now. If there\u2019s no blog, there\u2019s no story.\u201d Alexander had taken his own work, and his site as a community gathering place, temporarily hostage in the hope that the  Times would either cancel the story or permit the use of his pseudonym. Should his readers like to help him, he went on, they might contact the technology editor, a veteran journalist based out of the paper\u2019s San Francisco bureau. In a parenthetical aside, he asked that his supporters remain courteous: \u201cRemember that you are representing me and the SSC community, and I will be very sad if you are a jerk to anybody. Please just explain the situation and ask them to stop doxxing random bloggers for clicks. If you are some sort of important tech person who the New York Times technology section might want to maintain good relations with, mention that.\u201d This plea conformed with the online persona he has publicly cultivated over the years\u2014that of a gentle headmaster preparing to chaperone a rambunctious group of boys on a museum outing\u2014but, in this case, it seemed to lend plausible deniability to what he surely knew would be taken as incitement.\n In the past seven years, S.S.C. has become perhaps the premier public-facing venue of the \u201crationalist\u201d community, a group of loosely affiliated writers and respondents who first coalesced, in the mid-two-thousands, on sites dedicated to the prospect that, with training and effort, our natural cognitive biases can be overcome. Many of these people work in or around Silicon Valley\u2014as mathematicians, programmers, or computer scientists\u2014and their common interests tend to include artificial intelligence, transhumanism, an appreciation for the subtleties of statistical thinking, and the effective-altruism movement.\n  Alexander\u2019s role in the community is difficult to encapsulate\u2014an e-book of his collected S.S.C. posts runs to about nine thousand pages\u2014but one might credit him with two crowning contributions. First, he has been instrumental in the evolution of the community\u2019s self-image, helping to shape its members\u2019 understanding of themselves not as merely a collection of individuals with shared interests and beliefs but as a mature subculture, one with its own jargon, inside jokes, and pantheon of heroes. Second, he more than anyone has defined and attempted to enforce the social norms of the subculture, insisting that they distinguish themselves not only on the basis of data-driven argument and logical clarity but through an almost fastidious commitment to civil discourse. (As he puts it, \u201cliberalism conquers by communities of people who agree to play by the rules.\u201d) If one of the bedrock beliefs in Silicon Valley is that the future ought to be determined by a truly free market in ideas, one emancipated from the influence of institutional incumbents and untainted by the existing ideological polarities, Slate Star Codex is often held up as an example of what the well-behaved Internet can look like\u2014a secret orchard of fruitful inquiry.\n Alexander\u2019s appeal elicited an instant reaction from members of the local intelligentsia in Silicon Valley and its satellite principalities. Within a few days, a petition collected more than six thousand signatories, including the cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker, the economist Tyler Cowen, the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, the cryptocurrency oracle Vitalik Buterin, the quantum physicist David Deutsch, the philosopher Peter Singer, and  the OpenAI C.E.O. Sam Altman. Much of the support Alexander received was motivated simply by a love for his writing. The blogger Scott Aaronson, a professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin, wrote, \u201cIn my view, for SSC to be  permanently deleted would be an intellectual loss on the scale of, let\u2019s say, John Stuart Mill or Mark Twain burning their collected works.\u201d Other responses seemed unwarranted by the matter at hand. Alexander had not named the reporter in question, but the former venture capitalist and cryptocurrency enthusiast Balaji Srinivasan, who has a quarrelsome Twitter personality, tweeted\u2014some three hours after the post appeared, at 2:33   in San Francisco\u2014that this example of \u201cjournalism as the non-consensual invasion of privacy for profit\u201d was courtesy of Cade Metz, a technology writer ordinarily given over to enthusiastic stories on the subject of artificial intelligence. Alexander\u2019s plea for civility went unheeded, and Metz and his editor were flooded with angry messages. In another tweet, Srinivasan turned to address Silicon Valley investors, entrepreneurs, and C.E.O.s: \u201cThe New York Times tried to doxx Scott Alexander for clicks. Just unsubscribing won\u2019t change much. They can afford it. What will is freezing them out. By RTing #ghostnyt you commit to not talking to NYT reporters or giving them quotes. Go direct if you have something to say.\u201d\n  Other prominent figures in Silicon Valley, including Paul Graham, the co-founder of the foremost startup incubator,  Y Combinator, followed suit. Graham did not expect, as many seemed to, that the article would prove to be a \u201chit piece,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s revealing that so many worry it will be, though. Few would have 10 years ago. But it\u2019s a more dangerous time for ideas now than 10 years ago, and the NYT is also less to be trusted.\u201d This atmosphere of danger and mistrust gave rise to a spate of conspiracy theories: Alexander was being \u201cdoxxed\u201d or \u201ccancelled\u201d because of his support for a Michigan State professor accused of racism, or because he\u2019d recently written a post about his dislike for paywalls, or because the  Times was simply afraid of the independent power of the proudly heterodox Slate Star Codex cohort.\n The proliferation of such elaborate conjectures was hardly commensurate with the vision of Slate Star Codex as a touchstone of patience and disinterest. Alexander\u2019s initial account of his exchange with Metz seemed to have seeded the escalation. For one thing, the S.S.C. code prioritizes semantic precision, but Metz\u2014if Alexander\u2019s account is to be taken at its word\u2014had proposed not to \u201cdoxx\u201d Alexander but to de-anonymize him. Additionally, it seems difficult to fathom that a professional journalist of Metz\u2019s experience and standing would assure a subject, especially at the beginning of a process, that he planned to write a \u201cmostly positive\u201d story; although there often seems to be some confusion about this matter in Silicon Valley, journalism and public relations are distinct enterprises. Finally, the business model of the  Times has little to do with chasing \u201cclicks,\u201d per se, and, even if it did, no self-respecting journalist would conclude that the pursuit of clicks was best served by the de-anonymization of a \u201crandom blogger.\u201d The  Times, although its policy permits exceptions for a variety of reasons, errs on the side of the transparency and accountability that accompany the use of real names. S.S.C. supporters on Twitter were quick to identify some of the  Times\u2019 recent concessions to pseudonymous quotation\u2014Virgil Texas, a co-host of the podcast \u201cChapo Trap House,\u201d was mentioned, as were Banksy and a member of  \u2014as if these supposed inconsistencies were dispositive proof of the paper\u2019s secret agenda, rather than an ad-hoc and perhaps clumsy application of a flexible policy. Had the issue been with Facebook and its contentious moderation policies, which are applied in a similarly ad-hoc and sometimes clumsy way, the reaction in Silicon Valley would likely have been more magnanimous.\n Until recently, I was a writer for the  Times Magazine, and the idea that anyone on the organization\u2019s masthead would direct a reporter to take down a niche blogger because he didn\u2019t like paywalls, or he promoted a petition about a professor, or, really, for any other reason, is ludicrous; stories emerge from casual interactions between curious reporters and their overtaxed editors. Perhaps Metz was casting about for something on Silicon Valley\u2019s good sense on the coronavirus, found Alexander\u2019s post, and thought he\u2019d look into it. (Metz declined to comment on the record, and a spokesperson for the  Times issued the following statement: \u201cWe do not comment on what we may or may not publish in the future. But when we report on newsworthy or influential figures, our goal is always to give readers all the accurate and relevant information we can.\u201d)\n But the rationalists, despite their fixation with cognitive bias, read into the contingencies a darkly meaningful pattern. Alexander, whose role has been to help explain Silicon Valley to itself, was taken up as a mascot and a martyr in a struggle against the  Times, which, in the tweets of Srinivasan, Graham, and others, was enlisted as a proxy for all of the gatekeepers\u2014the arbiters of what it is and is not O.K. to say, and who is allowed, by virtue of their identity, to say it. As Eric Weinstein, a podcast host and managing director at Peter Thiel\u2019s investment firm, tweeted, \u201cI believe that activism has taken over.\u201d Here was the first great salvo in a new front in the culture wars.\n The temperature of the reaction only seemed to climb as rumors spread that Metz\u2019s interest in Slate Star Codex might not be limited to Alexander\u2019s early warnings about the coronavirus. Messages from Metz, published on Twitter and Reddit, revealed that his overtures to S.S.C. figures had referred to the blog\u2019s readership with such adjectives as \u201cpowerful\u201d and \u201cinteresting,\u201d and noted that S.S.C. was a \u201chugely influential voice, not only with the tight-knit community in the comments, but with some very influential figures in Silicon Valley and beyond.\u201d These neutral, noncommittal words were ominously interpreted, taken as a clue that the reporter might be working on something other than a light, flattering story. On July 1st, a Bay Area attorney whose Twitter bio reads \u201cInto Stoicism, engineering, blockchains, Governance Econ, InfoSec, 2A,\u201d tweeted, \u201cSome inside sources tell me @CadeMetz is running around asking if @slatestarcodex meetups were \u2018all white men\u2019 and whether \u2018commenters were trying to recruit people into white supremacy.\u2019 Words cannot express how much I want to see @nytimes burn for this.\u201d Alexander\u2019s supporters were working themselves into a tizzy about a story that had not been published and, for all they knew, never would be. Alexander told me, via e-mail, that he\u2019d \u201cgotten word that more of my enemies and people connected to embarrassing incidents in my life were interviewed, all after I went public with my blog post.\u201d After that, he chose to respond to only a few of my questions.\n What would eventually become the rationalist community had its distant origins in the futurist Listservs of the very early Internet era. But it took shape as an identifiable movement on a blog called LessWrong, which was created in 2009 and maintained by a machine-intelligence researcher and former Orthodox Jew named Eliezer Yudkowsky, an acerbic autodidact best known for an endless ur-text called the Sequences, as well as a two-thousand-page fanfic series called \u201cHarry Potter and the Methods of Rationality.\u201d LessWrong was, among many other things, a forum for the expression of early concerns about the existential risk posed by runaway artificial intelligence, and it attracted such contributors as the Oxford researcher Nick Bostrom and the libertarian-leaning economist Robin Hanson, whose own blog, Overcoming Bias, served as a precursor. In time, the rationalist movement developed into a symposium for dispassionate, data-driven conversation about economics, philosophy, social science, and culture taken up in the spirit of logical serenity. Perhaps the largest share of its attention is devoted to metacognitive elucidations of the tools of reason, and the heroic effort to purge oneself of common biases and fallacies. The community grew comfortable with its own private lexicon, one almost designed to be daunting to outsiders unfamiliar with the concepts of \u201cpareidolia\u201d or the \u201cmotte-and-bailey fallacy.\u201d\n  Under the influence of Bay Area counterculture, a prominent fraction of the community extended to the offline world their disinclination to observe convention: they often live in communal settlements, experiment with nootropics, and practice polyamory. In \u201c The AI Does Not Hate You,\u201d an excellent overview of rationalist history and debate, the British journalist Tom Chivers notes with an avuncular warmth that most rationalists seem constitutionally incapable of ordinary small talk. They do, however, have a tendency to make any idle assertion into the subject of a proposition bet, a pastime that embodies their conviction that you can only think clearly about the expected value of an outcome if you have \u201cskin in the game,\u201d or a personal stake. (Before the publication of Chivers\u2019s book, Alexander wagered a thousand dollars that it would not present a negative image of the rationalist community, and won.)\n  Alexander began as a contributor to LessWrong, and the center of rationalist gravity followed him, in 2013, to Slate Star Codex. As a leading member of a community that views personal identity as theoretically immaterial to logical matters, he only occasionally finds it relevant to mention the details of his own life, but its contours are easy enough to find online. He is not yet forty. He grew up in Southern California and attended a leafy liberal-arts college in the Northeast, where he won scholarships for his undergraduate work in philosophy. He attended medical school abroad, did humanitarian service in Haiti, and lived in the Midwest before he fetched up in the Bay Area. Alexander has described himself as an \u201casexual heteroromantic,\u201d and has also practiced polyamory, which is mentioned on the blog, and lives in some form of intentional community. He takes an annual survey of his readership and frequently reports on the patterns he discovers, especially when they diverge from expectations. \u201cThe average IQ is in the 130s,\u201d he wrote, in 2016. \u201cWhite men are overrepresented, but so are LGBT and especially transgender people.\u201d\n  On the blog, Alexander strives to set an example as a sensitive, respectful, and humane interlocutor, and even in its prolixity his work is never boring; the fiction is delightfully weird and the arguments are often counterintuitive and brilliant. He has frequently allowed that a previous position he\u2019s taken is wrong\u2014his views of trans people are a major example\u2014and has contributed to the understanding, among people who like to be right about everything, that the gracious acceptance of one\u2019s own error (or \u201cfailure mode\u201d) ought to be regarded as a high-status move rather than something to be stigmatized. Alexander\u2019s terminal commitment, he has said repeatedly, is to the \u201cprinciple of charity,\u201d a technical term he has borrowed, from the analytic philosophers W. V. O. Quine and Donald Davidson, and slightly repurposed to mean, as Alexander once put it, \u201cif you don\u2019t understand how someone could possibly believe something as stupid as they do, that this is more likely a failure of understanding on your part than a failure of reason on theirs.\u201d\n Many rationalist exchanges involve lively if donnish arguments about abstruse thought experiments; the most famous, and funniest, example, from LessWrong, led inexorably to the conclusion that anyone who read the post and did not immediately set to work to create a superintelligent A.I. would one day be subject to its torture. Others reflect a near-pathological commitment to the reinvention of the wheel, using the language of game theory to explain, with mathematical rigor, some fact of social life that anyone trained in the humanities would likely accept as a given. A minority address issues that are contentious and at times offensive. These conversations, about race and genetic or biological differences between the sexes, have rightfully drawn criticism from outsiders. Rationalists usually point out that these debates represent a tiny fraction of the community\u2019s total activity, and that they are overrepresented in the comments section of S.C.C. by a small but loud and persistent cohort\u2014one that includes, for example, Steve Sailer, a peddler of \u201c scientific racism.\n......", "posttime": "2020-07-10 00:45:20", "source_domain":

"note_en": "Employees inside Ford have asked the company\u2019s leadership to stop making and selling police vehicles, according to   Jalopnik. In response, Ford CEO Jim Hackett has told employees in a letter that he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s \u201ccontroversial that the Ford Police Interceptor helps officers do their job\u201d and that Ford will continue the business.\n The internal discussion, which Ford confirmed to  The Verge, comes as the country is gripped by national movements for racial justice and against police brutality that were sparked by the killing of George Floyd.\n Ford is far and away the leading automaker in the US when it comes to making and selling specially-designed vehicles for law enforcement, making up some two-thirds of the market. While it\u2019s not a big source of the company\u2019s annual revenue (which was $156 billion in 2019), Ford has long maintained that its overall lineup benefits from new technologies that get tested in the police vehicles (like hybrid electric drivetrains, for example).\n \u201cOur resources can and should be diverted to other forms of first response and public safety\u201d\n The national protests, though, have inspired some Ford employees to rethink the company\u2019s relationship with police. The issue has been brought up at recent town hall meetings, and now employees \u2014 including Black workers who are part of Ford\u2019s African Ancestry Network (FAAN) employee resource group \u2014 have circulated a letter asking the company to \u201ccease development, production, and sale of all custom police vehicles and products.\u201d\n Other employees have since signed onto the letter (though it\u2019s unclear how many) and they want the company to take some kind of action by July 15th, according to  Jalopnik. \u201cOur resources can and should be diverted to other forms of first response and public safety,\u201d the employees wrote.\n  The seemingly  endless footage of police violence captured across the last few months has caused a reckoning in some industries, especially tech. Nextdoor stopped a program that  allowed users to forward posts to law enforcement. Amazon even announced it will stop allowing police to  use its facial recognition technology for a year, and  Microsoft has made a similar pledge. This all came after employees across the tech industry have spent the last year pushing back against their  companies\u2019 contracts with government agencies, too.\n But the same couldn\u2019t really be said for the transportation industry (save for bike companies,  which are split on the matter), even though some of the most horrific videos to go viral in the last two months featured protestors being run over by Ford police vehicles.\n This is one reason why employees inside Ford are now arguing that the company should sever its relationship with police. \u201cWe cannot claim to support the fight against systemic racism while supplying and supporting the very systems that perpetrate violence against Black Americans,\u201d the group wrote, according to  Jalopnik.\n  Throughout our history, the vehicles that Ford employees design and build have been used as accessories to police brutality and oppression. We know that while many join, support, or supply law enforcement with good intentions, these racist policing practices that plague our society are historic and systemic \u2014 a history and system perpetuated by Ford for over 70 years \u2014 ever since Ford introduced the first-ever police package in 1950. As an undeniable part of that history and system, we are long overdue to \u201cthink and act differently\u201d on our role in racism.\n When Hackett publicly  addressed the nationwide protests in early June, he said \u201c[t]here are no easy answers,\u201d and that Ford is \u201cnot interested in superficial actions.\u201d Hackett said that \u201c[t]his is our moment to lead from the front and fully commit to creating the fair, just and inclusive culture that our employees deserve.\u201d\n But in his internal letter to employees, Hackett defended the company\u2019s business of making vehicles for police. And he argued that Ford\u2019s police cars, SUVs, and trucks could make those police officers \u201csafer and more accountable\u201d \u2014 though without going into detail:\n The issues plaguing police credibility have nothing to do with the vehicles they\u2019re driving. In fact, as we imagine the future power of our connected vehicles, smarter Ford vehicles can be used to not only improve officers\u2019 ability to protect and serve, but also provide data that can make police safer and more accountable. Just think, dating back to the Model T, Ford has more than 100 years in serving first responders and that leadership over the decades has been earned by co-developing our purpose-built vehicles and technologies with police and emergency agencies to make our vehicles the number one choice.\n Hackett also said that taking away Ford\u2019s specially-built vehicles \u201cwould be doing harm to [police officers\u2019] safety and making it harder for them to do their job.\u201d\n \u201cAgain, this is why, given our insights, new capabilities and leadership, I believe these unfortunate circumstances present Ford with an even greater opportunity to not only innovate new solutions but also leverage our unique position to support the dialogue and reform needed to create safer communities for all,\u201d Hackett wrote.\n He wrapped his letter by thanking employees for speaking up, but saying that Ford won\u2019t change course. \u201cI do appreciate people speaking their mind to me on this issue \u2013 it helped me generate this note to explain why we are continuing our commitment to police forces all over the world in our trusted products,\u201d he said.", "posttime": "2020-07-10 00:44:56", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u798f\u7279,\u5458\u5de5,employees", "title": "\u798f\u7279\u5458\u5de5\u8981\u6c42\u516c\u53f8\u505c\u6b62\u751f\u4ea7\u8b66\u8f66", "title_en": "Ford employees ask the company to stop making police cars", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317894/ford-employees-black-police-vehicles-law-enforcement-george-floyd", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u798f\u7279", "\u5458\u5de5", "employees"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1010827, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728ARM\u62ab\u9732CPUSLS\u6f0f\u6d1e\u548cLLVM\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u521d\u59cb\u7f13\u89e3\u540e\u82b1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46GNU\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u96c6\u5408(GCC)\u73b0\u5728\u4e5f\u9488\u5bf9\u6b64\u76f4\u7ebf\u63a8\u6d4b\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7f13\u89e3\u3002(\u6ce8\uff1aGnu Compiler Collection(Gnu Compiler Collection\uff0cGNU Compiler Collection)(GCC))\u73b0\u5728\u4e5f\u9488\u5bf9\u6b64\u76f4\u7ebf\u63a8\u6d4b\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7f13\u89e3\u3002\u76f4\u7ebf\u63a8\u6d4b\u6f0f\u6d1e\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4ARMv8\u5904\u7406\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u66f4\u6539\u540e\u6267\u884c\u3002\u7f13\u89e3SLS\u6d89\u53ca\u5728\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u4e4b\u540e\u5bf9\u63a8\u6d4b\u5c4f\u969c\u4f7f\u7528SB\u6307\u4ee4\u3002ARM\u4eca\u5929\u4e0eGCC Git\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u6700\u521d\u7684SLS\u7f13\u89e3\u5305\u62ecRET\u548cBR\u6307\u4ee4\u3002SB\u6307\u4ee4\u5728\u53d7\u652f\u6301\u7684SoC\u4e0a\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u6d4b\u5c4f\u969c\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u4e3aDSB SY+ISB\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d0\u4ea4\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86BLR\u6307\u4ee4\u7684SLS\u3002\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528-mharden-sls=\u4e3aGCC\u542f\u7528ARM SLS\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c\u503c\u4e3a&#34\uff1bALL&34\uff1b\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u6240\u6709\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\uff1b\u503c\u4e3a&#34\uff1bretbr&#34\uff1b\u53ef\u4ec5\u5728RET\u548cBR\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0a\u63d2\u5165\u63a8\u6d4b\u969c\u788d\uff1b\u6216&#34\uff1bblr&34\uff1b\u53ef\u4ec5\u7f13\u89e3BLR\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u5c1a\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u3002ARM SLS\u7f13\u89e3\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u5c06\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5230\u6765\u3002", "note_en": "It took a month after  Arm disclosed the CPU &#34;SLS&#34; vulnerability and when the LLVM compiler landed their initial mitigation, but the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) now has mitigations as well for this Straight Line Speculation vulnerability.\r   The Straight Line Speculation vulnerability could lead to instructions on ARMv8 processors being executed following a change in control flow.

"note_en": "Marketing teams should scale alongside new business revenue. As the company generates new business, the marketing budget gets bigger and the team scales accordingly.\n Companies often think about go-to-market (GTM) spend in terms of payback periods - if we put a dollar into the business today, how long will it take to get that dollar back in terms of revenue. For example, if we spent $15m on GTM in 2019 and generated $15m new business ARR in 2019 that would be a 12 month payback period. A 12 month payback is considered great for most SaaS businesses.\n When you combine the idea of payback periods along with industry benchmarks for marketing spend you start to get a picture of what marketing budgets look like as you scale. According to  Keybanc, SaaS companies spend between 15% and 50% of their go-to-market budget on marketing.\n When you map out this percentage spend against payback periods, you start to get a sense of what your marketing budget at different revenue targets should look like.\n  The mix is largely determined by the sales motion. Generally, Self-serve SMB businesses require more marketing spend whereas enterprise sales heavy businesses require less marketing.\n From here you can start to get a sense of what you can afford and how big your marketing team could be at each point in scale. Generally, marketing teams (full-time-employees) account for 35-40% of your marketing budget.\n Another helpful datapoint comes from  Insight Partners, where they provide benchmarks for new logo bookings per marketing employee (FTE).\n   As companies target bigger customers, individual marketers are able to support more revenue scaling from $498k/FTE to $1,238k/FTE. Bigger ACV companies typically have smaller marketing teams as the go-to-market strategy is more outbound sales led, rather than through digital growth marketing tactics.\n By taking these benchmarks and extrapolating them against new business targets, you start to get a clear picture of what your marketing team should look like over time.\u00a0 \u200d\n   So for example, if I want to generate $9m in new business this year, and most of my customers pay me $50k each, then i\u2019ll want to have a marketing team of around 11 people, but if i mainly focus on SMB customer then i\u2019ll likely need a team of 18 people.\n Of course, benchmarks and extrapolations only tell part of the story. Some companies index higher on programs vs. people. The exact mix depends on what you\u2019ve found to work for your business in the past and what you want to experiment with in the future. Additionally,\u00a0 your capital position will naturally change your level of investment.\n From personal experience, I found the above benchmarks to be a bit inflated to how we\u2019ve built the team at Lattice.\u00a0 Historically, we\u2019ve tended to operate a lean team of generalists, hire more contractors and indexed towards more program spend. But as we\u2019ve added more specialization on the team, the numbers start to even out towards the above benchmarks.\u00a0 \u200d\n Regardless, understanding the relationship between new business targets, size of customer contracts, and go-to-market motion will help you to determine the size of your marketing team as the business grows.\n Sign up for my newsletter.

"note_en": "Last week, 2K made waves by becoming the first publisher to  set a $70 asking price for a big-budget game on the next generation of consoles.  NBA2K21 will cost the now-standard $60 on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, but 2K will ask $10 more for the upcoming Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 versions of the game (a $100 &#34;Mamba Forever Edition&#34; gives players access to current-generation and next-generation versions in a single bundle).\n It remains to be seen if other publishers will follow 2K&#39;s lead and make $70 a new de facto standard for big-budget console game pricing. But while $70 would match the high-water mark for  nominal game pricing, it wouldn&#39;t be a historically high asking price in terms of  actual value. Thanks to inflation and changes in game distribution, in fact, the current ceiling for game prices has never been lower.\n  To measure how the actual asking price for console games has changed over time, we relied primarily on  scanned catalogs and  retail advertising fliers we found online. While this information was easier to find for some years than others, we were still able to gather data for 20 distinct years across the last four decades. We then adjusted those nominal prices to constant 2020 dollars using  the Bureau of Labor Statistics&#39; CPI inflation calculator.\n To avoid the influence of low-priced bargain bin games or retailer discounts, we focused on the highest asking prices for individual games we could find in each year (collector&#39;s editions excluded). But to avoid undue skewing from outliers like  the $100 Genesis version of  Virtua Racing, we averaged the highest top-level asking price we could find for a &#34;basket&#34; of games representing up to eight different genres. So for NES prices in 1988, the $49.99 top asking price for\u00a0 Blades of Steel\u00a0in the Sports slot was partially balanced out by the $34.99 top asking price for\u00a0 The Karate Kid in the &#34;fighting/brawler&#34; slot.\n  The resulting data is a little noisy from year to year, depending on which specific games were included on extant advertisements we could track down. Over time, though, the pricing trends are still pretty easy to spot.\n While nominal cartridge game prices in the early &#39;80s topped out at $30 to $40, inflation makes that the equivalent of $80 to $100 per game these days. Nominal prices stayed relatively flat into the late &#39;80s as the industry started recovering from the great crash, but inflation brought the actual value down a bit in constant dollars.\n    As the industry transitioned into 16-bit cartridges in the &#39;90s, though, nominal prices for top-end games rose quickly past $60 in nominal dollars and $110 in 2020 dollars. That&#39;s in large part because of the expensive ROM storage and  co-processors often included in games of the day. By 1997, late-era SNES and early-era N64 games were routinely selling for $69.99 at many retailers, the highest nominal prices the industry has generally seen and still the equivalent of over $110 in today&#39;s dollars.\n  The late-&#39;90s transition to disc-based games relieved a lot of the cost pressure on physical game production, which translated to generally lower prices for consumers. But that pricing transition didn&#39;t happen immediately. Early Saturn and PlayStation games in 1996 would regularly sell for $59.99 or more, translating to about $100 in 2020 dollars.\n Disc prices settled down to a more reasonable $49.99 soon after that, setting a functional nominal price ceiling that would remain until the mid &#39;00s. It wasn&#39;t until the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 hit the scene that top asking prices started increasing to $59.99. And that&#39;s the de facto ceiling that has remained in place to this day, even as digital downloads and the explosion of indie games has meant many titles now launch at well below this price.\n Adjusting for inflation, we can see the actual (2020 dollar) value of top-end disc-based games plateaued right around $70 for almost a decade through in the &#39;00s and early &#39;10s. Inflation has slowly eroded that value in the last decade, though, to the point where a $10 increase like the one for  NBA2K21 merely gets games to the same actual price point as they enjoyed earlier in the century.\n  As the &#34;real value&#34; of big-budget games has increased, publishers have looked for new ways to squeeze more money out of the average player. Trends like  collector&#39;s editions, widespread  downloadable content,  season pass subscriptions, and  annoying microtransactions have meant some players already spend much more than $60 for a single top-end title.\n Raising a game&#39;s basic asking price to $70 won&#39;t eliminate publishers&#39; need or desire to exploit these further revenue streams. But it may help make up for the bottom-line deficits brought on by  ballooning development costs for graphically intensive titles in the  consoles&#39; coming ray-tracing era.\n Those additional costs may be hard for many gamers to swallow, just as  similar increases for streaming video subscription services have been over the years. That&#39;s especially true now that there&#39;s so much gaming competition from lower-cost and even high-quality free-to-play titles.\n But a bump to $70 would not be a historically unprecedented increase in console gaming&#39;s price ceiling. Accounting for inflation, in fact, it would merely bring those prices back in line with the recent historical average\u2014something to keep in mind as you prepare for a new, seemingly costlier

They include Laura Grimmelmann (Ex-Accel), Nicolas Kopp (CEO, N26 U.S.), Roland Grenke (Dubsmash co-founder) and Zachary Smith (SVP of product at U.S. challenger bank Chime).\n Founded early this year and with a planned launch in early 2021, Berlin-based Amie is developing a productivity app that combines a person\u2019s calendar and to-dos in one place. Previously called coco, it promises to work across all devices, with an interface that \u201cworks just like you think\u201d.\n  \u201cBack in the day, you had a calendar on your office wall, and a to-do list on a notepad,\u201d M\u00fcller tells me. \u201cYou could take your list with you elsewhere, but not your calendar. Those were digitized instead of rethinking the flow. Most productivity apps solve very specific problems, creating a new one, [and] users need too many tools\u201d.\n M\u00fcller says Amie is built on the principle that \u201cto-dos, habits and events all take time, and all belong in the same place\u201d. Many people already schedule to-dos and the startup wants offer the fastest way to create to-dos, schedule events, check your calendar \u201cand even jump into Zoom calls\u201d.\n As a glimpse of what\u2019s to come, Amie promises to let you drag \u2018n\u2019 drop to-dos into your day, or turn links and screenshots into to-dos. \u201cWith Amie\u2019s Alfred-like app, you can create an event and invite people in a different timezone, all while other apps are still loading,\u201d says the young company.\n More broadly, Amie wants to act as a central workspace, letting you also do things like join video calls, take notes, and do email, without the need to open extra browser tabs and therefore avoid \u201ccontext switching\u201d.\n \u201cAmie will target professionals who are currently using Google Calendar, due to our integration,\u201d adds M\u00fcller. \u201cThe waitlist already counts thousands of users, who are mostly professionals working in the tech industry e.g. designers, developers, bizdevs, etc\u201d.", "posttime": "2020-07-10 00:23:22", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4ea7\u54c1\u7ecf\u7406,\u7a0b\u5e8f,\u652f\u6301,backs,amie", "title": "\nCrecodures\u652f\u6301Amie\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u6765\u81ea\u524dn26\u4ea7\u54c1\u7ecf\u7406\u4e39\u5c3c\u65af\u00b7\u7a46\u52d2(Dennis M\u00fcller)\u7684\u65b0\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tCreandum backs Amie, a new productivity app from ex-N26 product manager Dennis M\u00fcller\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/amie/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4ea7\u54c1\u7ecf\u7406", "\u7a0b\u5e8f", "\u652f\u6301", "backs", "amie"]}]
