Fuchs is a physicist at the University of Massachusetts Boston and the leading proponent of QBism, one of the newest and most controversial of quantum theory’s many interpretations. It goes something like this: Quantum mechanics, the theory physicists use to predict the behavior of elementary particles like electrons and photons that make up matter and light, doesn’t actually pertain to particles, but rather to the  beliefs about them of whoever is using the theory. And if several people are using it at the same time? Then QBism says that each of them is entitled not only to their own beliefs, but to their own  facts.</p><p>我第一次采访Chris Fuchs时就搞砸了。福斯是波士顿麻州大学的物理学家，也是QBIST的主要倡导者，是量子理论最新和最具争议性的众多解释之一。它是这样的：量子力学，物理学家用来预测组成物质和光的电子和光子等基本粒子的行为的理论，实际上与粒子无关，而是与使用该理论的人对粒子的信念有关。如果几个人同时使用它呢？然后QBism说，他们每个人不仅有权拥有自己的信仰，而且有权拥有自己的事实。</p><p> It was August 2020 and Fuchs and I were talking over Zoom. He was slumped in a stuffed armchair, sporting wire-rimmed glasses and pandemic-long hair. He’d insisted I educate myself about QBism before talking to me, and had sent me 17 links to articles, interviews, and videos. Now he was regaling me with an anecdote-filled story of his career when I blurted out the question that had been bugging me all along, which was essentially, “How the hell could that be right?”</p><p>那是2020年8月，福斯和我在讨论Zoom。他瘫倒在一张填充扶手椅上，戴着金属丝框眼镜，留着一头长发。他坚持在和我交谈之前让我对QBism进行自我教育，并给我发了17个文章、采访和视频链接。现在，当我脱口而出一个一直困扰着我的问题时，他正在用一个充满奇闻轶事的职业生涯故事逗我开心，这个问题本质上是，“这怎么可能是对的？”</p><p> If our theories don’t mirror an underlying reality, in what sense can they supply explanations?</p><p>如果我们的理论不能反映一个潜在的现实，那么在什么意义上它们能提供解释呢？</p><p> Fuchs, like me, is in his mid-50s, and has a boyishly rounded face. My blunder was immediately obvious in the way that face melted before my eyes, like wax under heat. In an instant he transformed from raconteur to lecturer, put up a picture of a complicated laboratory setup and began grilling me about it. “Do two guys who walk in and casually glance at this experiment agree what the experiment is doing?” he asked. The lecture concluded with a theorem sketched on a whiteboard. I was kicking myself the whole time, not just because I’d scotched my plan to get to know Fuchs better before wrangling over QBism, but because I couldn’t follow his argument anyway, despite my background in physics, including a Ph.D.</p><p>福斯和我一样，50多岁，长着一张孩子气的圆脸。我的失误很明显，那张脸在我眼前融化了，就像热下的蜡一样。转眼间，他从一个健谈的人变成了一个演讲者，贴出了一张复杂实验室设置的照片，开始盘问我。“两个走进来漫不经心地瞥了一眼这个实验的人是否同意这个实验在做什么？”他问道。讲座结束时，白板上画了一个定理。我自始至终都在自责，这不仅是因为在就QBism争吵之前，我放弃了更好地了解福斯的计划，还因为我无论如何都无法理解他的论点，尽管我有物理学背景，包括博士学位。</p><p> Actually, my education was part of the problem, as was the reason I went into physics in the first place. I was a tough case in elementary school, an intelligent and curious but also emotional and impulsive ADHD kid with a home life roiled by conflict and the confusion of stories that didn’t add up. Being class clown was my greatest ambition until a teacher discovered that I’d finished a math workbook in a weekend that was supposed to take a year. That led to me finding myself in the back of an algebra class in a panic, as a teacher tapped equations on the board, and I was baffled by the letters.  What the heck is x? I suffered in silence until the epiphany finally came.  X is a number, just one you don’t know yet. Euphoria! Plus, the sensation of having opened a door to a place containing many more doors leading to many more ideas beyond “ x.” That palace of ideas, with its numbers and symbols and geometric shapes, soon became a playground as well as a refuge, a place where all my “why” questions had answers and where things made sense in a way that didn’t apply to the rest of my life. I was later drawn to physics for its promise that the palace was real, and that hidden somewhere inside it was one grand equation that, like the God I’d dismissed for being too magical, could ultimately explain everything.</p><p>事实上，我的教育是问题的一部分，这也是我开始学习物理的原因。在小学的时候，我是一个很难对付的人，一个聪明、好奇但又情绪化、冲动的多动症孩子，家庭生活被冲突和混乱的故事搅乱，这些故事都没有意义。成为班上的小丑是我最大的抱负，直到一位老师发现我在一个周末完成了一本数学练习册，这本应该需要一年的时间。这让我发现自己在一堂代数课的后面惊慌失措，一位老师在黑板上敲打方程式，我被这些字母弄糊涂了。x到底是什么？我默默忍受，直到顿悟终于到来。X是一个数字，只是一个你还不知道的数字。兴奋此外，打开一扇门，通往一个包含更多门的地方，带来了“x”之外更多想法的感觉。这个想法的宫殿，有着数字、符号和几何形状，很快就成了一个游乐场和避难所，在这里，我所有的“为什么”问题都有答案，在那里，事情以一种不适用于我余生的方式变得有意义。后来，我被物理学所吸引，因为它承诺宫殿是真实的，而在宫殿的某个地方隐藏着一个宏大的方程式，就像我因为太神奇而抛弃的上帝一样，它最终可以解释一切。</p><p>  By the time I spoke with Fuchs I was less wide-eyed about physics (graduate school will do that to you), but the palace was still my happy place. I’d internalized a lesson that emotions are dangerous and developed an aversion to conflict and a craving for certainty that translated to my keeping a certain distance from people. Marriage, for example, had long been a bridge too far. And I doubted my ability to change, in part because a world that’s ultimately nothing but particles conforming to the laws of physics appeared to make free will a delusion.</p><p>当我与福斯交谈时，我对物理学的了解已经不那么多了（研究生院会这样做的），但宫殿仍然是我快乐的地方。我已经内化了一个教训，即情绪是危险的，并形成了对冲突的厌恶和对确定性的渴望，这转化为我与人保持一定的距离。例如，婚姻长久以来一直是一座过犹不及的桥梁。我怀疑自己改变的能力，部分是因为一个最终只不过是符合物理定律的粒子的世界似乎让自由意志成为了一种错觉。</p><p> At the same time, I could see there was a problem with the idea that physics can explain the world, because of the way quantum theory describes particles with probabilities rather than properties. We tend to think that the sizes, shapes, and locations of physical objects are explained by the locations of their constituent particles. Quantum theory, however, doesn’t attribute such properties to particles, describing them instead in terms of the probabilities that they will  appear  to have locations if and when they are  observed. And yet what “observed” means and what happens during an observation to make properties materialize out of quantum theory’s murk of possibilities and into the solid shapes that objects have in our everyday experience are questions that the theory doesn’t address. Physicists call this gap in quantum theory’s account of explanation the “measurement problem.”</p><p>与此同时，我发现物理学可以解释世界的想法存在问题，因为量子理论用概率而不是属性来描述粒子。我们倾向于认为，物理物体的大小、形状和位置是由其组成粒子的位置来解释的。然而，量子理论并没有将这些特性归因于粒子，而是根据粒子在被观察到时出现位置的概率来描述它们。然而，“被观察到的”意味着什么，以及在观察过程中发生了什么，使属性从量子理论的黑暗可能性中具体化，并变成我们日常经验中物体的固体形状，这些都是该理论没有解决的问题。物理学家将量子理论解释中的这一缺口称为“测量问题”</p><p> A host of interpretations of quantum theory offer an assortment of stories purporting to solve the measurement problem, but I wasn’t satisfied with any of them. QBism’s tale is the latest in a tradition that denies that quantum theory directly describes reality and yet, to hear Fuchs tell it, still offers the possibility of getting some grasp on what “reality” really is. “The world is not made of six flavors of quarks,” he’d written. “It is a world in which even dreams and ambitions have substance.”</p><p>对量子理论的大量解释提供了各种各样的故事，旨在解决测量问题，但我对其中任何一个都不满意。QBism的故事是一个否认量子理论直接描述现实的传统的最新版本，然而，听福斯讲，它仍然提供了对“现实”到底是什么的一些理解。“世界不是由六种夸克组成的，”他写道。“这是一个连梦想和抱负都有实质内容的世界。”</p><p> That sort of woo raised a red flag in my materialistic mind, as did Fuchs’ habit of saying that QBism’s take on quantum mechanics “makes life worth living.” Still, it was clear that QBism was worth taking seriously, as it had been by a raft of recent physics papers including one in  Nature Physics titled “Facts Are Relative.” So as unsettling as I found such ideas, I was determined to get on Fuchs’ good side and to learn how to think like a QBist myself.</p><p>这种求爱在我的唯物主义思想中升起了一面红旗，福斯说量子力学的量子力学“让生命有价值”的习惯也是如此尽管如此，很明显，QBism值得认真对待，就像最近一系列物理学论文一样，包括《自然物理学》中一篇题为《事实是相对的》的论文因此，尽管我发现这些想法令人不安，但我决心站在福斯这边，学习如何像QBist一样思考。</p><p>  A few weeks after my talk with Fuchs, high on a stony Adirondack peak, my heart pounding with nerves, I got down on one knee, looked up at my girlfriend Martina’s freckled face, and asked her to marry me. A few days later, I shared the story by email with Fuchs. Not something I’d usually do, but he’d sent me photos from his own wedding, 25 years before, on Ghost Ranch in New Mexico, former home of painter Georgia O’Keeffe. He’d fallen in love with Kiki in a week and, overcome with emotion, had proposed six months later with a cigar band for a ring, despite a promise to himself that he’d wait at least a year. I noted the contrast with my own proposal, made after the 30-odd years of bachelorhood it took me to get used to the idea, the two-plus years of dating that was my rule, and a grueling 4-mile hike up a mountain for good measure.</p><p>我和福斯在阿迪朗达克的一座石峰上交谈了几周后，我的心因神经紧张而怦怦直跳，我单膝跪下，抬头看着女友玛蒂娜长满雀斑的脸，向她求婚。几天后，我通过电子邮件与福斯分享了这个故事。我通常不会这么做，但他给我寄了25年前他自己婚礼的照片，那是在新墨西哥州的幽灵牧场，画家乔治亚·奥基夫的故居。他在一周内就爱上了琪琪，情绪激动，六个月后，他向一个雪茄乐队求婚要了一枚戒指，尽管他向自己承诺至少要等一年。我注意到这一点与我自己的提议形成了鲜明的对比。我在30多年的单身生活后，才习惯了这个想法，两年多的约会是我的规则，还有一次艰苦的4英里爬山。</p><p> I blurted out the question that had been bugging me all along. “How the hell could that be right?”</p><p>我脱口而出了一直困扰我的问题。“这怎么可能是对的？”</p><p> I’d recovered from our first interview by talking to Fuchs a second time and keeping my focus on getting to know him personally. Once he was convinced that my interest in QBism was genuine, he began inundating me with emails, links, and reading lists, including four books by and about William James, whose philosophy was apparently important. Sprinkled into my QBism correspondence course came all manner of personal anecdotes and photos: of 20-something Fuchs in swim trunks on a beach, of his backyard smoker and the glistening meats he’d made with it, of him proudly holding up a giant weed he’d pulled from his yard. “I have no internal filter,” he told me. Still, not all of the deluge was amicable. Fuchs read an article I’d written for the  New York Times Magazine  and objected to my labeling the views of atomic physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg “anti-realist.” He referred to that word as “that damned misnomer,” and said my comment calling those views a “dead end” had “nothing to do with the historical record.”</p><p>我已经从第一次面试中恢复过来，第二次和福斯交谈，并把注意力集中在了解他个人上。一旦他确信我对QBism的兴趣是真诚的，他就开始给我发电子邮件、链接和阅读清单，其中包括威廉·詹姆斯的四本书，以及关于他的四本书，他的哲学显然很重要。我的QBism函授课程中散布着各种各样的个人轶事和照片：20多岁的富克斯穿着泳裤在海滩上，他在后院抽烟，用它做了闪闪发光的肉，他自豪地举着从院子里拔出来的一根巨大的杂草。“我没有内部过滤器，”他告诉我。然而，并不是所有的洪水都是友好的。福斯读了我为《纽约时报》杂志写的一篇文章，反对我把原子物理学家尼尔斯·波尔和维尔纳·海森堡的观点称为“反现实主义”他把这个词称为“那个该死的用词不当的人”，并说我的评论称这些观点是“死胡同”，“与历史记录无关”</p><p> I figured my comments stung because if QBism is Fuchs’ baby, the closest thing to its grandfather is Bohr. Bohr won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1922 for devising a model of atoms in which electrons are confined to one of a discrete set of orbits around the atom’s nucleus, an idea that defied both the laws of physics at the time as well as common sense, since it required electrons to jump between orbits but to never  be between orbits. Nonetheless, the model accounted for observed phenomena like the colors of light emitted and absorbed by hydrogen gas, and in 1925 Heisenberg conceived quantum theory by coming up with equations that predicted not only Bohr’s results, but other atomic phenomena as well. The strange thing was that Heisenberg’s handiwork was pure mathematical manipulation; his equations only referred to observable quantities like light frequencies and avoided any description of electron behavior that could explain  why those frequencies were what they were.</p><p>我觉得我的评论很刺痛，因为如果QBism是福斯的宝贝，那么最接近它祖父的就是波尔。波尔在1922年因设计了一个原子模型而获得诺贝尔物理学奖，在该模型中，电子被限制在原子核周围的一组离散轨道中的一个，这一想法既违背了当时的物理定律，也违背了常识，因为它要求电子在轨道之间跳跃，但决不能在轨道之间。尽管如此，该模型解释了观察到的现象，如氢气发射和吸收的光的颜色。1925年，海森堡提出了不仅预测玻尔结果，而且预测其他原子现象的方程式，从而构想了量子理论。奇怪的是，海森堡的作品纯粹是数学运算；他的方程式只提到了可观测的量，比如光的频率，并避免了对电子行为的任何描述，以解释为什么这些频率是这样的。</p><p> Meanwhile, Erwin Schrödinger developed his own version of the theory that, by treating electrons as waves, he hoped would reveal the workings inside the black box that Heisenberg had made. But the mathematical object that Schrödinger called the wave function, now often called the quantum state, didn’t describe physical waves in the way he’d hoped. Instead, it became the standard device physicists use to summarize the theory’s probabilities. Albert Einstein, whose belief that physics can and should describe the world’s inner workings had always inspired me, figured the theory was simply incomplete. But Bohr and Heisenberg argued that the lesson of these developments was that physics describes something else. “The laws of nature which we formulate mathematically in quantum theory deal no longer with the particles themselves,” wrote Heisenberg, “but with our  knowledge of the elementary particles.”</p><p>与此同时，埃尔文·薛定谔发展了自己的理论版本，他希望通过将电子视为波来揭示海森堡制造的黑匣子内部的工作原理。但是薛定谔称之为波函数的数学对象，现在通常被称为量子态，并没有像他希望的那样描述物理波。相反，它成了物理学家用来总结理论概率的标准装置。阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦（Albert Einstein）认为物理学可以也应该描述世界的内部运作，这一信念一直激励着我，他认为这个理论根本不完整。但波尔和海森堡认为，这些发展的教训是，物理学描述了其他东西。海森堡写道：“我们在量子理论中用数学方法表述的自然法则不再涉及粒子本身，而是涉及我们对基本粒子的知识。”</p><p> “Knowledge” meant the information encoded in the quantum state; for example, the probability that a given atom will appear at a particular location when it’s observed. Bohr proposed an explanation for why physics must give its account of reality from such a remove. “We must never forget,” he wrote, “that we ourselves are both actors and spectators in the drama of existence.”</p><p>“知识”是指量子态中编码的信息；例如，一个给定的原子在被观察时出现在特定位置的概率。玻尔提出了一个解释，解释为什么物理学必须从这样一个角度来解释现实。“我们永远不能忘记，”他写道，“我们自己也是存在戏剧中的演员和观众。”</p><p> Bohr’s point was that our observations change and to some degree create the world we observe, an idea supported by the way quantum theory implies that the observer of an object and the object itself necessarily become, to use Schrödinger’s word, entangled. What’s observed is not the object per se, but instead a kind of mash-up of the object, the observer, and all the choices made in the method of observation. Bohr called these mash-ups—things like the colors of light emitted and absorbed by hydrogen—“phenomena,” and concluded that quantum theory tells us that physics, rather than describing the world as it is, must describe such phenomena, or, as he also put it, the “human experience” of the world.</p><p>玻尔的观点是，我们的观察改变了，并在某种程度上创造了我们所观察的世界，量子理论支持了这一观点，用薛定谔的话来说，一个物体的观察者和物体本身必然会纠缠在一起。观察到的不是对象本身，而是对象、观察者和观察方法中所有选择的一种混搭。玻尔将这些混搭的东西，如氢发射和吸收的光的颜色，称为“现象”，并得出结论，量子理论告诉我们，物理必须描述这种现象，而不是描述世界的本来面目，或者，正如他所说，描述世界的“人类体验”。</p><p> Many seemingly paradoxical behaviors of subatomic particles, such as those that appear in a classic case of quantum inexplicability called the double-slit experiment, can be demystified with this perspective. In the double-slit, particles such as electrons are fired at a screen with two holes in it, and the mystery is how they sometimes exhibit interference effects as if they were spread-out waves and yet in other circumstances act like point-like particles. To this day, there are physicists who argue that Einstein was right, that quantum theory is incomplete, and that so-called “hidden variables”—meaning particle properties not appearing in quantum mechanics—are necessary to explain this behavior.</p><p>亚原子粒子的许多看似自相矛盾的行为，比如量子不可解释的经典案例“双缝实验”中出现的那些行为，可以用这种观点来解开谜团。在双缝中，像电子这样的粒子被发射到一个有两个孔的屏幕上，而谜团在于，它们有时如何表现出干涉效应，就好像它们被传播出去的波一样，而在其他情况下，它们的行为就像点状粒子。直到今天，仍有物理学家认为爱因斯坦是对的，量子理论是不完整的，所谓的“隐藏变量”——即量子力学中没有出现的粒子特性——是解释这种行为的必要条件。</p><p> But Bohr believed the apparent contradictions of quantum phenomena result from attempts to picture the world as it is apart from observation, when  that’s something we just can’t do. A corollary was that concepts like “particle,” “wave,” and “which slit” an electron passed through are not realities but rather what Bohr called “abstractions”: ideas devised to describe phenomena in terms of observer and observed when that distinction doesn’t actually exist. In which case, an electron is neither particle nor wave; it just is what it is, or rather what it does when we interact with it. And despite how nonsensical it sounds: There is simply  no fact of the matter  of which slit an electron passed through unless that passing was observed.</p><p>但玻尔认为，量子现象的明显矛盾源于试图把世界描绘成与观察不同的样子，而这是我们无法做到的。一个推论是，像“粒子”、“波”和“撕裂”一个电子通过的概念不是现实，而是波尔所说的“抽象”：当这种区别实际上不存在时，设计用来描述观察者和观察者现象的想法。在这种情况下，电子既不是粒子也不是波；它只是它的本来面目，或者更确切地说，是我们与它互动时它所做的事情。尽管这听起来很荒谬：除非观察到电子通过哪个狭缝，否则根本不存在电子通过哪个狭缝的事实。</p><p> Such was Bohr’s radical reimagining of physics. And yet, Fuchs argues, Bohr wasn’t radical enough.</p><p>这就是玻尔对物理学的彻底重新构想。然而，福斯认为，玻尔还不够激进。</p><p>  QBukis,” in Fuchs-speak, are weekly meetings Fuchs has with his research group, nowadays on Zoom. I attended my first in October 2020. Fuchs was slouched in his chair, his pandemic hairdo now two months longer than when I’d last seen him. During the period of random banter that QBukis invariably start with, Fuchs brought up a favorite Wings song, “Let Me Roll It,” and played it for the group. As the crosstalk subsided, Fuchs asked Jacques Pienaar, a young postdoc working with him from Brazil, to take over and lead a discussion about a recent paper by a group of physicists who support a rival interpretation to QBism. The central question was how to deal with Wigner’s friend.</p><p>QBukis，“在Fuchs的演讲中，Fuchs每周都会与他的研究小组在Zoom上举行会议。我在2020年10月参加了我的第一次会议。Fuchs懒洋洋地坐在椅子上，他的发型比我上次见到他的时候长了两个月。在QBukis总是以随机玩笑开始的那段时间里，Fuchs唱了一首最喜欢的Wings歌曲，“让我来吧。”随着相声的平息，福斯请与他一起工作的巴西年轻博士后雅克·皮纳尔接手并主持一场讨论，讨论的是一群物理学家最近发表的一篇论文，他们支持对QBism的一种对立解释。核心问题是如何处理维格纳的朋友。</p><p> Everyone’s heard of Schrödinger’s cat, the thought experiment in which a cat is locked in a box with a quantum device having a 50-50 chance of releasing a poisonous gas. The point of confusion is that quantum theory’s quantum state characterizes the cat as a superposition of the two possible outcomes: dead or alive. While popular culture gets a lot of mileage out of imagining what it means for the cat to  be in such a superposition, the theory doesn’t actually speak to that question, and Bohr would remind us that that’s because physics must restrict itself to describing human experience, in this case what the observer sees when he or she opens the box and looks. Schrödinger published this scenario in 1935. Oddly, it took a quarter of a century and another Nobel Laureate to ask what in retrospect seems like an obvious question: If physics is about human experience, why not put a person in the box?</p><p>每个人都听说过薛定谔猫，这是一个思维实验，在这个实验中，一只猫被锁在一个装有量子装置的盒子里，有50%的几率释放有毒气体。令人困惑的是，量子理论的量子态将猫描述为两种可能结果的叠加：死亡或活着。虽然大众文化从想象猫处于这种叠加状态意味着什么中获得了很多好处，但这个理论实际上并没有回答这个问题，波尔会提醒我们，这是因为物理学必须将自身局限于描述人类经验，在这种情况下，观察者打开盒子看时看到的东西。1935年，薛定谔发表了这一设想。奇怪的是，花了四分之一个世纪和另一位诺贝尔奖得主才提出了一个回顾起来似乎显而易见的问题：如果物理学是关于人类经验的，为什么不把一个人放进盒子里？</p><p> That’s what Hungarian physicist Eugene Wigner did, calling the imaginary person his “friend.” Being a friend, Wigner switched out the poison for a device with a light, which we can imagine comes on either red or green. The result of Wigner’s analysis is that the friend in the box sees, for example, green and believes the quantum state should reflect that result, while Wigner, in the same position as the observer of Schrödinger’s cat, believes the state to be a 50-50 superposition of the two colors. Wigner’s state is analogous to that in the double-slit experiment and indicates, by Bohr-style reasoning, that there is no fact of the matter about the light’s color. The conclusion is that, while Wigner’s friend  knows the green light is a fact, Wigner, with equal justification,  knows it isn’t. This result highlights a troubling gap in Bohr’s and Heisenberg’s contention that quantum theory is about human knowledge and experience, namely the answers to the questions:  Whose knowledge? And  whose experience?</p><p>匈牙利物理学家尤金·维格纳（Eugene Wigner）就是这么做的，他称这个假想的人是他的“朋友”作为一个朋友，维格纳关掉了一个带有灯的装置的毒药，我们可以想象它是红色或绿色的。维格纳分析的结果是，盒子里的朋友看到了绿色，并认为量子态应该反映出这个结果，而维格纳与薛定谔猫的观察者处于相同的位置，认为量子态是两种颜色的50-50叠加。维格纳的状态与双缝实验中的状态类似，通过波尔式的推理表明，光的颜色不存在任何事实。结论是，虽然维格纳的朋友知道绿灯是事实，但维格纳也有同样的理由知道事实并非如此。这一结果突显了波尔和海森堡关于量子理论是关于人类知识和经验的论点中的一个令人不安的差距，即对以下问题的答案：谁的知识？谁的经历呢？</p><p>  The “Facts Are Relative” paper in  Nature Physics, written by physicist Caslav Brukner, focuses on a variation of Wigner’s friend and argues that quantum theory’s capacity for contradictions runs deep enough to imply that facts are indeed relative to the observer, much as space and time were found to be by Einstein. This is a more bizarre conclusion than even Bohr and Heisenberg seem to have anticipated, but in a way it’s not new. The Many Worlds Interpretation of quantum theory, for example, claims that every possible outcome of every physical interaction happens, that the universe is constantly cleaving to accommodate all the resulting contradictory facts, and that in the case of Wigner’s friend both the device with the light and the friend divide into two, and then proceed to live separate lives with different facts (red vs. green) in distinct branches of a vast and ever-growing multiverse.</p><p>物理学家卡斯拉夫·布鲁克纳（Caslav Brukner）在《自然物理学》（Nature Physics）上发表了一篇题为“事实是相对的”的论文，该论文关注的是维格纳朋友的一个变体，并认为量子理论的矛盾能力足够深刻，足以暗示事实确实是相对于观察者的，就像爱因斯坦发现的空间和时间一样。这是一个比玻尔和海森堡似乎预期的更奇怪的结论，但在某种程度上这并不是新的结论。例如，对量子理论的多世界解释声称，每一种物理相互作用的每一种可能结果都会发生，宇宙不断分裂以容纳所有由此产生的矛盾事实，而对于维格纳的朋友来说，带光的设备和朋友都一分为二，然后在一个巨大且不断增长的多元宇宙的不同分支中，以不同的事实（红色和绿色）过着不同的生活。</p><p> The QBists panned their rivals’ paper. Marcus Appleby, a longtime collaborator of Fuchs’, reclined on a sofa in Sydney, declared it “incoherent.” Blake Stacey, a physicist, like Fuchs, at University of Massachusetts Boston, was frustrated by the paper’s assumption that two physicists can communicate perfectly about experimental outcomes.</p><p>QBIST抨击了竞争对手的论文。福斯的长期合作者马库斯·阿普尔比（Marcus Appleby）斜靠在悉尼的一张沙发上，宣称这是“不连贯的”Blake Stacey，一个物理学家，像福斯，在波士顿麻州大学，对该论文的假设感到失望，认为两个物理学家能够完美地交流实验结果。</p><p> Listening to the QBists eviscerate what would otherwise seem to me a passable paper made me feel as though I’d happened upon a more advanced civilization, of aliens maybe, to whom premises that most physicists take for granted are deemed antiquated and naïve. It was Fuchs who delivered the QBist coup de grace. The authors, he said, “don’t even worry about what the hell probability means.”</p><p>听QBIST把原本在我看来还可以通过的论文掏空，让我觉得自己仿佛遇到了一个更先进的文明，可能是外星人，对他们来说，大多数物理学家认为理所当然的前提被认为是过时和幼稚的。是福斯发动了QBist政变。他说，作者们“根本不用担心概率到底意味着什么。”</p><p> As I logged out of the meeting, that comment struck me as capturing the defining observation of QBism: Quantum mechanics describes everything with probabilities so what “probability” means is central to what the theory is about. The problem is that philosophers and mathematicians have been debating that since long before quantum theory and, as Bertrand Russell said, “nobody has the slightest idea what it means.”</p><p>当我退出会议时，这句话让我震惊，因为它捕捉到了QBism的定义性观察：量子力学用概率描述一切，所以“概率”的含义是该理论的核心。问题是，早在量子理论出现之前，哲学家和数学家就一直在争论这个问题，正如伯特兰·罗素所说，“没有人知道它的意思。”</p><p>  Probability, like love, beauty, and good taste, resists objective definition. That’s easy to see in situations like a coin toss, where Newton’s laws assure us that no real randomness is involved and that a person armed with a video camera and an appropriately programmed computer could potentially predict the outcome far more competently than a more casual observer who assigns a 50 percent probability to heads. But even in the quantum case, where the indeterminacy is intrinsic, there is no escaping the fact that the probabilities a person assigns are to some degree subjective, depending on their experience, knowledge, preferences, and even their personality—there’s always that guy who thinks he knows more than he does.</p><p>概率，就像爱、美和品味一样，抗拒客观的定义。在抛硬币这样的情况下很容易看出这一点，牛顿定律向我们保证，不涉及真正的随机性，一个配备了摄像机和适当编程的计算机的人可能比一个更随意的观察者更有能力预测结果，后者将50%的概率分配给头部。但即使在量子的情况下，不确定性是内在的，也无法逃避这样一个事实：一个人分配的概率在某种程度上是主观的，取决于他们的经验、知识、偏好，甚至他们的个性，总有一个人认为他知道的比他知道的更多。</p><p> QBism’s core tenet is that probabilities are  completely  subjective, the personal beliefs of whoever is assigning them, constrained only by the rules of probability theory such as one which says that each must be valued between zero and one. This interpretation of probabilities is called “personalist Bayesian.” The “Q” in QBism stands for quantum and the “B” for Bayesian (or at least it did until Fuchs ditched that connection and made QBism its own brand, like KFC). It, like Fuchs’ marriage, got its start in the mid-1990s when he was a graduate student at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque studying under physicist Carlton Caves and determined to get to the bottom of quantum theory. It was Caves and particularly his postdoc Ruediger Schack who won Fuchs over to the personalist Bayesian perspective, and QBism grew out of a collaboration between the three.</p><p>QBism的核心信条是，概率是完全主观的，是分配概率的人的个人信念，仅受概率论规则的约束，比如说，每个概率的值必须在0到1之间。这种对概率的解释被称为“个人化贝叶斯”QBism中的“Q”代表quantum，而“B”代表Bayesian（至少在Fuchs放弃这种联系，将QBism打造成自己的品牌之前是这样的，比如肯德基）。它就像福斯的婚姻一样，始于上世纪90年代中期，当时他是阿尔伯克基新墨西哥大学的一名研究生，在物理学家卡尔顿洞穴中学习并决心进入量子理论的底部。正是Caves，尤其是他的博士后Ruediger Schack，让Fuchs接受了个性化的贝叶斯观点，而QBism正是在这三者的合作中成长起来的。</p><p> QBism’s account of quantum theory’s meaning follows from its core tenet. If the quantum state of an atom, for example, is considered to describe the  atom, then quantum theory, which is basically a bunch of rules for how states evolve, amounts to a system for predicting what the atom might do. But with probabilities construed as beliefs, the quantum state becomes beliefs too, and the entire theory transmogrifies into a whole other animal. The state of the atom then describes the theory’s  user, specifically their beliefs about what they may experience by probing the atom. And the theory’s rules then govern those beliefs, informing the user about how to optimize them. Fuchs calls quantum theory a “law of thought,” and “a system for making better decisions in light of the world you’re in.”</p><p>QBism对量子理论意义的解释源于其核心原则。例如，如果一个原子的量子态被认为是描述原子的，那么量子理论，基本上是一系列关于状态如何演化的规则，相当于一个预测原子可能会做什么的系统。但当概率被解释为信念时，量子态也变成了信念，整个理论变成了另一个动物。然后，原子的状态描述了理论的使用者，特别是他们对通过探测原子可能经历的体验的信念。然后，该理论的规则管理这些信念，告知用户如何优化它们。Fuchs称量子理论是“思维法则”，是“根据你所处的世界做出更好决策的系统”</p><p> This viewpoint resolves the contradictions in Wigner’s friend. Wigner’s and his friend’s states differ because they represent different users’ beliefs about their potentially different future experiences. QED.</p><p>这种观点解决了维格纳的朋友之间的矛盾。维格纳和他朋友的状态不同，因为它们代表了不同用户对未来可能不同体验的信念。QED。</p><p>  It’s almost too easy, the way QBism quashes quantum conundrums. And it took a while for its implications to sink in.</p><p>这几乎太容易了，就像QBism解决量子难题一样。过了一段时间，它的影响才逐渐深入人心。</p><p> One day, in the depths of a pandemic winter spent holed up in a house in the woods with my new fiancé, I looked out the window and saw a titmouse hopping around in the snow. I realized, with a shock, that the QBists would say that what I was calling a titmouse was not actually a thing in the world, and that this was the key to their solution to the measure</p><p>一天，在一场大流行的严冬中，我和我的新未婚夫躲在森林里的一所房子里，我从窗户望出去，看到一只山雀在雪地里蹦蹦跳跳。我震惊地意识到，QBIST会说我所说的山雀其实不是世界上的东西，这是他们解决这一问题的关键</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/量子/">#量子</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/quantum/">#quantum</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/福斯/">#福斯</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
