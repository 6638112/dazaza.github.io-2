Then two arrived at once. When should we expect the next one? And what can they teach us?</p><p>天文学家花了几十年来寻找从我们自己的太阳系外面寻找物体。然后两次抵达。我们什么时候应该期待下一个？他们能教我们什么？</p><p> It emerged from the celestial void in October 2017 – a tiny bright speck on the telescope at   Haleakalā Observatory,  Hawaii.</p><p> 它从2017年10月的天体无效中出现 - 夏威夷哈里克·天文台的望远镜上的一个小明亮的斑点。</p><p> Tumbling through space at 57,000mph (90,000 kmph), the object is thought to have come from the direction of Vega, an alien star that resides 147 trillion miles (237 trillion km) away. Possibly shaped like an elongated cigar, possibly formed into an uncannily spaceship-like disc, by the time it was spotted it had already zipped by our own Sun, performed a slick hairpin turn, and begun hurtling off in another direction.</p><p> 通过空间在57,000英里/小时（90,000公里），该目的被认为是从Vega的方向来源于Vega，一个住在147万亿英里（237万km）的外星人明星。可能像一个细长的雪茄，可能形成一个不百万化的太空飞船，当它被发现它已经被我们自己的太阳拉伸，表演了一个光滑的发夹转动，并在另一个方向上开始脱落。</p><p> This space anomaly was named &#39; Oumuamua – pronounced oh-moo-uh-moo-uh – Hawaiian for &#34;a messenger from afar arriving first&#34;. Robert Weryk, the astronomer at the University of Hawaii who first detected it,  knew immediately from its speed that he was looking at something new to physics. This was no ordinary comet or asteroid, it was an interstellar visitor from a distant, unidentified solar system – the first to have ever been found.</p><p> 这个空间异常被命名为＃39; Oumuamua  - 发音哦 -  moo-uh-moo-uh  - 夏威夷为＆＃34;远处的一个使者抵达First＆＃34;夏威夷大学的天文学家Robert Weryk立即从其看待物理学的东西时立即了解。这不是普通的彗星或小行星，它是来自遥远的，未识别的太阳系的星际访客 - 首先被发现。</p><p> Appropriately for an object with such alien origins, it soon became clear that &#39;Oumuamua was suitably strange. Two things in particular fixated scientists.</p><p> 适当地为具有这种外星的物体的对象，很快就会变得清楚地＆＃39; Oumuamua适当奇怪。特别是固定科学家的两件事。</p><p> The first was its mysterious acceleration away from the Sun, which was hard to reconcile with many ideas about what it might have been made of. The second was its peculiar shape – by some estimates, it was 10 times as long as it was wide. Before &#39;Oumuamua,  the most elongated known space objects were three times longer than they were wide.</p><p> 首先是它远离太阳的神秘加速，这很难与对其所做的事情的许多想法进行调和。第二种是其特殊的形状 - 通过一些估计，只要它宽度就要是10倍。之前＆＃39; Oumuamua，最细长的已知空间物体比宽度长三倍。</p><p> Over the years that followed, scientific journals and global media headlines swarmed with speculation. Was it a  block of solid hydrogen? Could it have been a  cosmic &#34;dust bunny&#34; – a giant space version of the clumps of hair and debris often found under living room furniture? Or was it, as the esteemed Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb suggested, an artificial construction  made by an intelligent extra-terrestrial civilisation?</p><p> 多年来，科学期刊和全球媒体头条新闻蜂拥而至。它是一块固体氢吗？它可以是一个宇宙＆＃34;尘埃兔子＆＃34; - 在客厅家具下常用的头发和碎片的巨大空间版本？或者是，正如尊敬的哈佛天文学家AVI Loeb所建议的那样，由智能的陆地文明制作的人工建筑？ </p><p>  Scientists had suspected for decades that our solar system might be regularly visited by these intergalactic voyagers, many of which are thought to have been roaming among the stars for billions of years. But though there are hundreds of specialist instruments scanning the skies each night, from a snow-battered telescope at the South Pole to the sun-baked Atacama Large Millimeter Array (Alma) in the Chilean Andes, none had ever been spotted.</p><p>科学家们曾曾曾怀疑我们的太阳系可能经常被这些间歇性的墓地定期访问，其中许多人被认为是漫游在星星中的漫游数十亿年。但是，虽然有数百种专业仪器每晚扫描天空，但从南极的雪地望远镜到智利和智利的雪地般的阿塔卡马大型毫米阵列（Alma），没有曾经发现过。</p><p>  On 30 August 2019, the engineer and amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov glimpsed an object moving against the predawn sky from his personal observatory in Nauchnyi, Crimea – using a telescope he had made himself. Even at first sight, he realised it was special – it was travelling in a different direction to the comets that inhabit the main asteroid belt that straddles the Solar System.</p><p>  2019年8月30日，工程师和业余天文学家Gennady Borisov瞥见了一个对手，在Nauchnyi，克里米亚的私人观测站中迈出了一个对手的物体 - 他使用了他自己的望远镜。即使是一见钟情，他也意识到它是特别的 - 它是在不同方向上行驶，彗星居住在跨越太阳系的主要小行星带。</p><p> 2I/Borisov was named in its discoverer&#39;s honour, and is suspected to be a rogue comet – one that&#39;s not bound to a star. So where did these visitors come from? What can they tell us about alien solar systems? And how often should we expect to see them?</p><p> 2i / borisov被命名为它的发现者＆＃39;荣誉，被怀疑是一个流氓彗星 - 它不受一颗星的＆＃39;那么这些访客来自哪里？他们能告诉我们什么是外星人太阳系？我们应该多久希望看到它们？</p><p>   &#39;Oumuamua has not yet been definitively  classified as a comet or an asteroid – it might be something else entirely – but scientists have always thought that most interstellar objects would be the former. Some of the comets that currently inhabit the furthest reaches of our own solar system may have originally been interstellar voyagers before they were captured by the Sun&#39;s gravity, so this would make sense.</p><p>   ＆＃39; Oumuamua尚未被视为彗星或小行星归类 - 它可能完全是别的 - 但科学家们一直认为大多数星际物体都是前者。目前居住在我们自己的太阳系中最远达到的一些彗星可能最初是在阳光下被捕获的突出的暴风母横向的海岸主义者，所以这将是有意义的。</p><p> However, most comets have &#34;tails&#34; – bright smudges that trail behind them – which form when they travel close to the Sun and heat up, releasing the frozen gases and dust inside them. As you might have guessed by now, &#39;Oumuamua didn&#39;t. This was particularly jarring, because its path took it deep into the Solar System, plunging towards the Sun and missing it by a mere 0.26 AU – around a quarter of the distance from the Earth to the Sun.</p><p> 但是，大多数彗星都有＆＃34;尾巴＆＃34; - 在它们后面的明亮污迹 - 当他们靠近阳光并加热时，它们的形式形成，释放冻结的气体和灰尘。正如你现在所猜到的那样，＆＃39; oumuamua didn＆＃39; t。这尤其困扰，因为它的道路将其深入太阳系，朝着太阳落山并错过了0.26奥 - 距离地球到太阳的四分之一距离。</p><p> &#34;As the data came in, more and more peculiarities came about,&#34; says Loeb, adding that he attended a conference about &#39;Oumuamua around this time, and when it ended, he left the room with a colleague who has worked on asteroids for decades. &#34;He said, &#39;This is so strange, I wish it had never existed&#39; – it took people out of their comfort zone.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;随着数据进入，越来越多的特点来自，＆＃34; Loeb说，他在这次参加了关于＆＃39的会议。当它结束时，他将房间与一位几十年来的小行星一起工作过。 ＆＃34;他说，＆＃39;这是如此奇怪，我希望它从未存在过＆＃39; - 让人们走出他们的舒适区。＆＃34;</p><p>   At first, scientists thought that perhaps this meant &#39;Oumuamua was a rocky asteroid after all. Then more observations came through. &#34;They found that it had this acceleration as it was moving away from the Sun,&#34; says Alan Jackson, an astronomer and planetary scientist at Arizona State University.</p><p>   起初，科学家认为也许这意味着＆＃39; Oumuamua毕竟是一个岩石的小行星。然后更多的观察结果通过了。 ＆＃34;他们发现它有这种加速，因为它远离太阳，＆＃34;亚利桑那州立大学的天文学家和行星科学家艾伦杰克逊说。 </p><p> This was universally baffling. It&#39;s perfectly normal for comets to accelerate as they travel back out from a close encounter with the Sun, but only because they are being powered by their tails – the gases being ejected give them a kick, like the engine on a rocket.</p><p>这是普遍困惑的。它对于彗星来说，彗星完全正常，因为他们从与太阳紧密遭遇跳出时加速，但只因为它们被他们的尾巴动力 - 所喷射的气体给他们一个踢，就像火箭上的发动机一样。</p><p>  &#34;That is really the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back for me, so to speak – in addition to the Sun&#39;s force of gravity, there was something pushing it away,&#34; says Loeb. &#34;In order to explain this push, you needed about a 10th of the mass of this object to evaporate.&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;这真的是突破骆驼的稻草＆＃39;回到我身边，所以要说 - 除了太阳＆＃39;的重力，还有一些推动它的东西，＆＃34; Loeb说。 ＆＃34;为了解释这一推动，您需要大约10个蒸发这个目的的10个质量。＆＃34;</p><p> One idea was that perhaps the object was a &#34;hydrogen iceberg&#34; – a giant lump of frozen hydrogen, which could have formed a tail that wouldn&#39;t be visible from Earth.</p><p> 一个想法是，也许对象是一个＆＃34;氢冰山＆＃34; - 巨大的冷冻氢气，这可以形成一个尾部，即从地球上可见。</p><p> However, not everyone was convinced. For a start, no one has ever seen hydrogen ice in space – Loeb and his colleagues have argued that lumps of it couldn&#39;t possibly have remained cold enough for long enough to form a large object like &#39;Oumuamua. And given that its freezing point (-259C/-434F) is only slightly above the ambient temperature of the Universe, it seems unlikely that it would have survived the several-hundred-million year trek from the nearest region of space thought to make such objects.  As one commentator put it, it would have fallen apart after being &#34; cooked by starlight&#34;.</p><p> 但是，不是每个人都相信。出于一开始，没有人在太空中看到氢冰 -  Loeb和他的同事们认为它的肿块可以＆＃39; T可能仍然足够冷，足以形成像＆＃39; Oumuamua等大物体。鉴于其冰点（-259c / -434f）仅略高于宇宙的环境温度，它似乎不太可能在最近的空间地区的几百万年徒步旅行中幸存下来对象。随着一个评论员所说，它会在＆＃34之后崩溃;由星光＆＃34烹制;</p><p> In all the confusion, the idea that &#39;Oumuamua might have been made by an intelligent alien civilisation began to look a little bit more plausible – for one thing, scientists at the Seti Institute were intrigued enough to point a telescope at it and  listen out for any radio signals that it might be emitting.</p><p> 在所有的混乱中，＆＃39的想法; Oumuamua可能已经被一个聪明的外星人文明所做的开始看起来更加合理 - 对于一件事而言，Seti Institute的科学家感到足够的兴趣来指出它和倾听它可能发出的任何无线电信号。</p><p> In the alien technology scenario, the unexplained push &#39;Oumuamua received from the Sun was caused by the reflection of sunlight off its surface, which would need to be a thin, flat and reflective – like the wind pushing the sail on a boat. The object was indeed extremely shiny for how small it was, &#34;but of course, nature doesn&#39;t make sails&#34;, says Loeb. &#34;So that&#39;s what led me to suggest in a Scientific American  article and later in a  scientific paper [and  now a book] that it may be of artificial origin.&#34;</p><p> 在外星技术场景中，无法解释的推动和＃39;从太阳收到的Oumuamua是由阳光从其表面的反射引起的，这需要是一种薄，平坦和反光的 - 就像风吹在船上的风。对于它的小，而且＃34但是当然，本质上的对象确实非常有光泽。而且，大自然没有制作帆＆＃34;洛杉矶。 ＆＃34;所以，在科学的美国文章中，在科学论文[现在是一本书]，它可能是人工来源的东西。＆＃34;</p><p> Loeb explains that another object – 2020-SO – received a similarly mysterious acceleration from the Sun in September 2020. It was initially spotted by the same telescope that found &#39;Oumuamua, and turned out to be a rocket booster from the failed Surveyor II mission launched in 1966, which aimed to land a spacecraft on the Moon. It was successfully launched into space, but quickly lost contact and had been drifting around for decades. Like Loeb&#39;s proposed alien &#34;lightsail&#34;, it had a flat, reflective surface that could repel light and propel it forwards.</p><p> Loeb解释说，另一个对象 -  2020  - 所以 - 所以在2020年9月获得了同样的神秘加速。它最初被发现的望远镜被发现＆＃39; oumuamua，并原来是来自失败的测量师的火箭助推器II在1966年推出的使命，旨在将航天器降落在月球上。它成功地发射到太空中，但很快就失去了联系，几十年来漂流。像Loeb＆＃39; S提出的外星人＆＃34; Lightrail＆＃34;它有一个平坦的反射表面，可以击退光并推动它前进。 </p><p>  In the end, Seti didn&#39;t find anything – though this  doesn&#39;t rule out the possibility that &#39;Oumuamua belonged to a long-dead cosmic civilisation.</p><p>最终，Seti Didn＆＃39; T找到任何东西 - 虽然这一事件并不排除了＆＃39; Oumuamua属于长死亡宇宙文明的可能性。</p><p> Then finally, earlier this year Jackson and his colleague Steven Desch came up with an explanation that seems to explain &#39;Oumuamua&#39;s quirky features, without the need for any alien technology. They started by ruling things out. For one thing, they knew that if there were any gases leaving &#39;Oumuamua, they couldn&#39;t include carbon monoxide, water, or carbon dioxide, because astronomers would have seen them.</p><p> 最后，今年早些时候杰克逊和他的同事史蒂文德奇提出了一个似乎解释的解释＆＃39;欧姆穆拉＆＃39;古怪的功能，无需任何外星技术。他们开始通过统治事物。一方面，他们知道如果有任何气体离开＆＃39; oumuamua，他们不能包括一氧化碳，水或二氧化碳，因为天文学家会看到它们。</p><p> &#34;It had to be something nobody had considered before,&#34; says Desch. It also couldn&#39;t have been hydrogen, because the Universe is just too hot. &#34;We just realised that nitrogen ice could supply exactly the amount of push it needs – and it&#39;s observed on Pluto,&#34; he says. To corroborate the idea, they calculated how shiny the surface of &#39;Oumuamua was and compared it to the reflectivity of nitrogen ice – and found that the two were  more or less exact matches.</p><p> ＆＃34;它必须是没有人考虑过的东西，＆＃34;德恩说。它也可以＆＃39; t一直是氢气，因为宇宙太热了。 ＆＃34;我们刚才意识到氮冰可以完全提供所需的推动量 - 以及在冥王星，＆＃34上观察到的＆＃39;他说。为了证实这个想法，他们计算了＆＃39的表面有多闪亮; Oumuamua是并将其与氮冰的反射率进行比较 - 发现这两个是或多或少的完全匹配。</p><p> The team concluded that the object was likely to be a chunk of nitrogen ice, which was chipped off the surface of a Pluto-like exoplanet around a young star. Based on the evolution of our own solar system, which started out with thousands of similar planets in the icy neighbourhood of the Kuiper belt, they suggested that the fragment may have broken off around half a billion years ago.</p><p> 该团队得出结论，该物体可能是一块氮冰块，它在一个年轻的明星周围切碎了冥王星的外部的表面。基于我们自己的太阳系的演变，它在Kuiper皮带的冰冷邻域内的成千上万的类似行星开始，他们建议片段可能已经缩短了大约十亿多年前。</p><p> &#34;Eventually Neptune moved through that region and ejected a lot of the material – and this happened very early on,&#34; says Desch. They suggest that &#39;Oumuamua has been travelling around the frigid, barren expanse of deep space ever since.</p><p> ＆＃34;最终海王星通过该地区移动并弹出了很多材料 - 这发生了很早的事情，而＃34;德恩说。他们建议＆＃39; oumuamua一直在寒冷的寒冷之旅，从那时起贫瘠的宽阔空间。</p><p> Though the object would have finally reached the very outermost edge of the Solar System many years ago, it would have taken a long time to travel to the balmy, central region where it was first discovered – and been gradually worn down into a pancake as it approached. This explains its unusual shape and its acceleration in one go, because the evaporating nitrogen would have left an invisible tail that propelled it forwards. &#34;Our atmosphere is mostly nitrogen and you can see though it,&#34; says Jackson. &#34;Nitrogen gas is difficult to detect.&#34;</p><p> 虽然这些物体终于多年前终于到了太阳系的最外面的边缘，但它将长时间去旅行到第一次发现的中央地区 - 并逐渐磨损到煎饼中接近。这解释了其一个不寻常的形状及其加速，因为蒸发的氮将留下一个不可见的尾巴，以推动它前进。 ＆＃34;我们的氛围大多是氮，你可以看到它，＆＃34;杰克逊说。 ＆＃34;氮气难以检测。＆＃34;</p><p>  For one thing, Loeb is sceptical that the Pluto-like planet &#39;Oumuamua came from would have had a large enough surface area for it to be statistically plausible that we have found a fragment of it. His team have calculated that you would need for the stars in the galaxy to have have 100 times the mass they do, to account for us seeing a nitrogen iceberg that&#39;s been chipped off. &#34;The surface layer of Pluto is only a few percent of its size,&#34; he says, &#34;so that just doesn&#39;t make sense&#34;.</p><p>  对于一件事，Loeb是令人抱歉的，冥王星样的星球＆＃39;欧穆拉瓜来自于足够大的表面积，以便在统计上可符合我们发现它的碎片。他的团队已经计算出你需要在银河系中的星星有100倍的群众，以解释我们看到氮冰山的氮冰山。 ＆＃34;冥王星的表面层只有其尺寸的百分之几，＆＃34;他说，＆＃34;所以刚刚没有意义＆＃34; </p><p> But if the theory turns out to be correct, &#39;Oumuamua may have provided a rare glimpse of what lies in alien solar systems.</p><p>但是，如果理论结果是正确的，而且＃39; Oumuamua可能已经提供了外星太阳系中所在的罕见瞥见。</p><p> At the moment, we can only see the planets that orbit other stars indirectly – by how much light they block out as their silhouette passes in front of tthe stars, or though the way their gravity distorts light as they pass by. It&#39;s all down to the mind-boggling distances involved. Travelling the 4.2 light years (25 trillion miles) to the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, would take thousands of years with our current technology. If it left the Earth now, a spacecraft like the Voyager – which is currently exploring deep space just outside our solar system – would  arrive in the year 75100.</p><p> 目前，我们只能看到间接地轨道的行星间接地 - 由于他们的轮廓在T恒星前面传出了多少灯，或者他们的重力扭曲了光线时，他们的剪影被传递。它＆＃39;涉及到令人沮丧的令人难以置信的距离。在最近的明星，Proxima Centauri旅行4.2光年（25万亿英里）将需要千年的技术。如果它现在离开了地球，像旅行者那样的航天器 - 目前在太阳系之外探索的深层空间 - 将在75100年到达。</p><p> &#34;Getting to another extrasolar planet is never going to happen in my lifetime, or that of Western civilisation,&#34; says Jackson. &#34;But we can have nature deliver pieces of them to us that we can actually see up close.&#34;.</p><p> ＆＃34;到另一个额外的地球永远不会发生在我的一生中，或西方文明，＆＃34;杰克逊说。 ＆＃34;但我们可以让他们对我们的大自然交付，我们实际上可以看到关闭。＆＃34;</p><p> The fact that &#39;Oumuamua was still relatively large when it entered our solar system suggests that was still a pristine fragment of its parent planet, preserved in the icy vacuum of space for half a billion years. In all that time, it is likely to have never encountered another star up close, until it stumbled upon our own. &#34;It probably passed through dozens of solar systems within a fraction of a lightyear, but it wouldn’t have survived another trip near a sun like ours,&#34; says Desch.</p><p> ＆＃39的事实;当它进入我们的太阳系时，Oumuamua仍然相对较大，这表明它仍然是其父母行星的原始片段，在冰冷的空间中保存了半年的冰冷却。在那个时候，它可能从未遇到过另一个明星关闭，直到它偶然发现自己。 ＆＃34;它可能在一个灯塔的一小部分内通过了几十个太阳能系统，但它不会像我们这样的阳光附近幸存下来，＆＃34;德恩说。</p><p> In particular, &#39;Oumuamua&#39;s possible identity as an icy nitrogen iceberg suggests that other solar systems are reassuringly similar to our own.</p><p> 特别是，＆＃39; oumuamua＆＃39;冰冰山的可能身份表明，其他太阳系是与我们自己相似的。</p><p>  &#34;What it tells us is that in the outer regions of other planetary systems, we have these larger objects like Pluto,&#34; says Jackson. Calculations have even suggested that the ice had a reddish tint, similar to the one found layered over Pluto&#39;s nitrogen glaciers, which contain methane. &#34;They&#39;re large enough that they differentiated – they were hot enough that they separated the different materials they were made out of and produced a layered structure.&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;它告诉我们的是，在其他行星系统的外部区域，我们有这些更大的物体，如冥王星，＆＃34;杰克逊说。计算甚至建议冰具有红色色调，类似于在含有甲烷的冥王星＆＃39; S氮冰川上的分层。 ＆＃34;他们＆＃39;重大足够大，它们差异化 - 它们足够热，使它们分开了它们的不同材料，它们制成了分层结构。＆＃34;</p><p> Before &#39;Oumuamua, the outer reaches of other planetary systems were a total mystery, because the objects there are too distant to form much of a silhouette against their neighbourhood star. &#34;We only really know about the ones that are closer in, because they go round more often and block out more of the starlight,&#34; says Jackson.</p><p> 之前的oumuamua，其他行星系统的外部到来是一个完全谜，因为对象太远来形成了对他们邻里星的大部分轮廓。 ＆＃34;我们真的知道那些更接近的人，因为他们往往更频繁地绕过更多的星光，＆＃34;杰克逊说。 </p><p> Even the nitrogen itself is news – in the Solar System, it&#39;s ubiquitous. But until &#39;Oumuamua, it was impossible to say whether it was common elsewhere. &#34;That isn&#39;t something we have any kind of direct handle on before,&#34; says Jackson.</p><p>即使是氮本身也是新闻 - 在太阳系中，它＆＃39;无处不在。但直到oumuamua，oumuamua，不可能说它是否在其他地方是常见的。 ＆＃34;那是我们之前有任何类型的直接手柄的东西，＆＃34;杰克逊说。</p><p>  Luckily, 2I/Borisov has turned out to be emphatically less difficult to decipher than its cosmic companion. It&#39;s been recognised as the first  interstellar comet ever found. Much like those lingering at the outer edges of the Solar System, 2I/Borisov is thought to have been composed of a muddy mixture of water, dust, and carbon monoxide. It had a visible tail and was more or less what scientists were expecting. If anything, 2I/Borisov makes &#39;Oumuamua seem even weirder.</p><p>  幸运的是，2I / Borisov已经证明不太难以解读而不是宇宙伴侣。它被认为是有史以来第一个星际彗星的被认为是＆＃39;与太阳系的外边缘缠绕的那样，2I / Borisov被认为是由水，灰尘和一氧化碳的泥泞的混合物组成。它有一个可见的尾巴，或多或少是什么科学家的期待。如果有的话，2I / Borisov使＆＃39; oumuamua似乎甚至令人烦恼。</p><p> 2I/Borisov is thought to have been ripped from an ancient solar system centred around a red dwarf star, the dimmest and most abundant type in our galaxy. Based on its speed and trajectory, one international team has tentatively calculated that it might have originated around the star Ross 573 – now a white dwarf – which inhabits a region of space around 629 trillion miles (965 trillion km) away from the Sun. They suggest that it was ejected into space after the violent collision of  three large objects in this celestial neighbourhood around 900,000 years ago.</p><p> 2I / Borisov被认为已被围绕着红矮星，古代太阳能系统的古老的太阳能系统，这是我们的银河系中的Dimmest和最丰富的类型。基于其速度和轨迹，一个国际团队暂定计算它可能已经围绕了星际罗斯573  - 现在是一个白矮星 - 距离太阳约629万亿英里（965万km）栖息地区。他们认为，在900万年前在这个天体邻里的三个大物体的暴力碰撞后被排入太空。</p><p> However, Jackson is dubious. &#34;We don&#39;t know which specific star system 2I/Borisov came from, it&#39;s been travelling for too long to track back to an individual system,&#34; he says. &#34;But because Borisov looks more like a solar system comet, we would expect that it came from the cloud of comets within its parent system, wherever that is.&#34;</p><p> 然而，杰克逊是可疑的。 ＆＃34;我们不知道哪个特定的明星系统2i / borisov来自，它＆＃39;一直在走回个单独的系统，＆＃34;他说。 ＆＃34;但是因为博伊奥看起来更像是太阳系彗星，我们希望它来自其父系统中的彗星云，无论何处。＆＃34;</p><p>  While some experts are mulling over how &#39;Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov can be so different, others are working on exactly how many other objects there might be like them.</p><p>  虽然一些专家仔细考虑如何＆＃39; Oumuamua和2i / Borisov可以如此不同，但其他人正在正常工作，究竟有多少其他物体可能会像它们一样。</p><p> &#34;We had expected that we would eventually see interstellar objects, because we know that comets in our own solar system are ejected on a reasonably regular basis,&#34; says Jackson. It was logical to assume that the same process would happen elsewhere in the galaxy – but totally hypothetical.</p><p> ＆＃34;我们预计我们最终会看到星际物体，因为我们知道我们自己的太阳系中的彗星是以合理定期的，＆＃34被弹出。杰克逊说。假设相同的过程将发生同样的过程是合乎逻辑的 - 但是完全假设的。</p><p> Even after the discovery of &#39;Oumuamua, exactly how rare or statistically improbable its arrival was remained as baffling as the object itself – for all anyone knew its arrival might have been a once-in-a-lifetime event. Equally, our solar system could be swarming with these fragments of the wider galaxy, which are so dark, they only show up when their path happens to take them right past the Sun.</p><p> 即使在发现＆＃39; Oumuamua，oumuamua的发现是多么罕见或统计上的抵达仍然被困惑，因为对象本身是令人困惑的 - 对于所有人来说，所有人都知道它的到来可能是一个终身活动的一毫无千变万变的活动。同样，我们的太阳系可能会蜂拥而至的较宽银河系的碎片，这是如此黑暗，当他们的道路发生在阳光下时，它们只会出现。 </p><p> Now that scientists have found two interstellar voyagers, their hunch has been more or less confirmed. But estimating exactly how common these objects are – and how often we can expect to see them – remains extremely tricky.</p><p>现在，科学家们发现了两个星际的盗贼，他们的亨希或多或少确认。但是估计这些对象的常见程度如何 - 我们可以期望看到它们的频率 - 仍然非常棘手。</p><p> One  early calculation performed by Loeb and colleagues long before any interstellar objects were actually seen, in 2009, looked at how likely we were to find a single one. They based their estimate on the density of stars in the Milky Way and assumptions about the amount of matter each of them is ejecting into the wider universe, then compared this to the sensitivity of the most powerful telescope on Earth. They concluded that the probability it will find one in its entire lifetime of searching is &#34;very small&#34; – between one in a 1,000 and one in 100,000. Objects like &#39;Oumuamua should be so rare, scientists almost shouldn&#39;t have seen it.</p><p> 在2009年，Loeb及其同事在任何星际物体上进行了一次早期计算，在2009年，看着我们找到一个单一的可能性。它们基于估计银河系中的恒星密度和关于它们中的每一个都被喷射到更广泛的宇宙中的思想中的假设，然后将其与地球上最强大的望远镜的敏感相比。他们得出结论，它在其整个寿命中找到一个搜索的概率是＆＃34;非常小的＆＃34; - 在1,000人中一个，一个100,000人之间。像＆＃39这样的物体; oumuamua应该是如此罕见，科学家们几乎应该看见它。</p><p> But they did. Based on its successful detection, one team calculated that, in each three-dimensional unit of space with sides the length of the distance from the Earth to the Sun, you would find approximately  five similarly-sized cosmic objects there at any given time.</p><p> 但他们做到了。基于其成功检测，一个团队计算出，在每个三维空间单元的空间，侧面距离地球到太阳的距离的长度，你会在任何给定时间找到大约五个类似尺寸的宇宙对象。</p><p>  This suggests a significantly higher density of interstellar matter in the galaxy than had previously been thought. It also hints that, rather than being solely produced by young solar systems when their planets are forming, these objects are released throughout the entire lives of stars – or they wouldn&#39;t be anywhere near as common.</p><p>  这表明星系中的明显较高的星际物质密度而不是先前被认为。它还提示，而不是仅由年轻的太阳能系统生产的行星在形成时，这些物体在整个星期之缘释放 - 或者它们不会像常见一样的任何地方释放。</p><p> Meanwhile, more recent research – made after the discovery of 2I/Borisov – suggests that there are  around 50 interstellar objects spanning at least 50m accross in our solar system at any given time.</p><p> 与此同时，在发现2I / Borisov后，更新的研究 - 表明，在任何特定时间内，我们的太阳系中有大约50个跨越至少50米的星际物体。</p><p> This is significant, because not all interstellar objects are as innocent as our recent visitors. While the impact that killed off the dinosaurs is now thought to have come from an object that originated  within our own solar system, interstellar asteroids and comets are likely to be  especially destructive, because they travel significantly faster than the ones orbiting our own Sun.</p><p> 这很重要，因为并非所有的星际物体都像我们最近的访客一样无辜。虽然现在被杀死恐龙的影响，但现在被认为是从我们自己的太阳系中起到的物体中，星形小行星和彗星可能是特别破坏性的，因为他们的旅行比我们自己的太阳绕着曲目的速度明显更快。</p><p>  Either way, scientists are about to get some answers. Detecting the faint glow of interstellar objects requires powerful equipment – exactly the kind that a new observatory under construction in Chile will have.</p><p>  无论哪种方式，科学家即将得到一些答案。检测到星际物体的微弱发光需要强大的设备 - 恰好是智利建设的新天文台的那种。 </p><p> The Vera Rubin Observatory sits on top of Cerro Pachón, a 2,682 metre (8,799-ft) high mountain in the north of the country. It&#39;s expected to go live in 2022 or 2023 and is home to the largest digital camera ever constructed for the field of astronomy. It will undertake nightly surveys of the night skies, searching for near-earth objects at least 140m (500ft) across – around two-thirds the size of &#39;Oumuamua and one-seventh the size of 2I/Borisov.</p><p>Vera Rubin观测台位于该国北部2,682米（8,799英尺）的高山上的CerroPachón顶部。它预计将在2022年或2023年居住，是最大数码相机为天文领域建造的最大数码相机。它将在夜空中进行夜间调查，在大约三分之二的大小的大约三分之二的近140米（500英尺处; Oumuamua和第七尺寸2i / Borisov大小的夜间对象。</p><p> Many astronomers are optimistic that it will find the next interstellar object – as well as our solar system&#39;s  elusive hypothetical extra planet, Planet Nine. &#34;What we really need is we need to see more objects like &#39;Oumuamua, then we can look at those statistics and actually get a proper picture of how many of those kind of objects there are,&#34; says Jackson.</p><p> 许多天文学家乐观地认为它会发现下一个星际物体 - 以及我们的太阳系＆＃39;象征的假设额外的星球，行星九个。 ＆＃34;我们真正需要的是，我们需要查看更多的对象，如oumuamua，那么我们可以看出这些统计数据，实际上可以获得有多少这些物体的图片，＆＃34;杰克逊说。</p><p>  Loeb&#39;s hope is that the telescope will identify the next interstellar object when it is on its way into our solar system, with enough warning that we have time to send a spacecraft to intercept it and take a closer look. He cites the Osiris-Rex mission, which launched in September 2016 and has already successfully travelled to the asteroid Bennu, more than  200 million miles (321 million km) from Earth. It&#39;s currently on its way back, due to return with photographs and samples in 2023.</p><p>  Loeb＆＃39;希望望远镜在进入我们的太阳系时，望远镜将识别下一个星际物体，有足够的警告，我们有时间发送宇宙飞船拦截并仔细看看。他引用了2016年9月推出的Osiris-Rex Mission，已经成功前往小行星Bennu，从地球上超过2亿英里（321万英里）。它目前正在回来的＆＃39;由于2023年的照片和样品返回。</p><p> &#34;And that will tell us if it&#39;s artificial, or, or natural,&#34; says Loeb. &#34;And, of course, if it looks artificial, that will be very interesting. And we could land on it, and even read off the labels ‘Made on Planet X’.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;这将告诉我们它是否＆＃39; s人工，或自然，＆＃34; Loeb说。 ＆＃34;当然，如果它看起来人为，那将是非常有趣的。我们可以降落它，甚至读出在行星X'上制作的标签。＆＃34;</p><p> Desch is equally enthusiastic about a trip to an interstellar object, though for slightly more conventional reasons. &#34;When we think about any sort of spacecraft going to something in our own solar system, we have a checklist of things we want to get at, and this would be the same,&#34; he says, listing off some of the most important items, such as whether it contains amino acids – hinting at possible organic life – and determining if it contains water or carbon monoxide. &#34;To get a rundown of all the chemistry of the object, that&#39;s what I&#39;d want,&#34; he says.</p><p> 烟囱同样热情地对星际物体的旅行，但是对于略微更传统的原因。 ＆＃34;当我们考虑在我们自己的太阳系中出现的任何宇宙飞船时，我们都有一个我们想要参加的清单，这将是相同的，＆＃34;他说，列出了一些最重要的物品，例如是否含有氨基酸 - 在可能的有机生命中暗示 - 并确定它是否含有水或一氧化碳。 ＆＃34;要获得对象的所有化学性，那个＆＃39;＆＃39; d想要的，＆＃34;他说。</p><p> But whatever happens, Loeb would like to see the scientific community keep an open mind – especially if our third encounter with an interstellar object proves just as baffling as &#39;Oumuamua</p><p> 但是，无论发生什么，Loeb都希望看到科学界保持开放的心态 - 特别是如果我们的第三次遭遇星际物体，那就被证明是令人难以置信的＆＃39; Oumuamua</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210506-the-interstellar-voyagers-that-visited-our-sun">https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210506-the-interstellar-voyagers-that-visited-our-sun</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/答案/">#答案</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/search/">#search</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/太阳系/">#太阳系</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
