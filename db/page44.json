", "note_en": "Since I first started working on my website at age fourteen, the sitehas gone through many revisions, and hopefully changed for the better.This blog was originally dynamically served using a Python/Flask backend,having a custom login system and post \u201ceditor\u201d (just an input box).One of the more strange things about my website, though, was how I displayedcontent.\n It was clear to me, even at my young age, that writing raw HTML wassuboptimal. Somehow (perhaps through GitHub) I heard about Markdown,and realized that a human-readable markup language was probably a muchbetter way to go. What remained was, of course, rendering the content.The easiest way I found was to just stick a JavaScript script, callingout to  marked, to run on pageload and convert all the markup into pretty HTML.\n This rendering would happen on every page load. Every time I navigatedbetween pages on my site, for a second or two, I\u2019d see the raw, unrenderedMarkdown that I had written, which would then disappear and be replacedwith a proper view of the page\u2019s content. The rendering wasn\u2019t error-proof,either. If my connection was particularly slow (which it was, thanks, Comcast),or if I forgot to disable uMatrix, I would be left having to sift throughthe frequent occurences of  #,  _,  *\u2026 Eventually I realized my mistake,and switched to rendering Markdown on the backend. Now, my contentwould appear to the user already formatted, and they wouldn\u2019t have towait for a JavaScript program to finish to read what I had written.All was well.\n Sometimes, I look back on the early iterations of my site, and smileat the silly mistakes I\u2019d made. Yet I can\u2019t innocently make fun ofmy original Markdown rendering solution, because in a way, it lives on.\n  When I search for \u201crender math on website\u201d on Google,the following two links are at the top of my search:\n  Indeed, these are the two most popular math rendering solutions(in my experience). Yet both of these solutiosn share something somethingin common with each other and with the early iterations of my website -they use client-side rendering for static content. In my opinion, this is absurd.Every time that you visit a website that uses MathJax or KaTeX, any mathematicalnotation arrives to your machine in the form of LaTex markup. For instance,       e  \u2212  x 2 e^{-\\frac{x}{2}}     e         \u2212           2        x \u200b     looks like  e^{-\\frac{x}{2}}. The renderingsoftware (MathJax or KaTeX) then takes this markup and converts it intoHTML and CSS that your browser can display. Just like my old website,all of this happens  every time the page is loaded. This isn\u2019t an uncommonthing, either: websites like Mathematics StackExchange and Chegg use MathJax, and many more can be foundon  this list.According to  this page, Facebook Messenger, Khan Academy,  Gitterand  GitLab use KaTeX. Some of these websitesdon\u2019t even load their content with JavaScript enabled, much less rendermath.\n A skeptic might say that it is not possible to render LaTeX to HTML andCSS ahead of time. This might even have been true in the past. A useron the \u201ccan we replace client-side MathJax with server-side MathJax\u201d thread on MathOverflow Meta in 2015 points out that MathJax doesn\u2019t supportserver-side HTML output:\n I found  [the comment] from a MathJax developer confirming that HTML+CSS doesn\u2019t work yet with the server-side version . . .\n    Or are we? Version 2.6 of MathJax has the following comment in its change log:\n Improved CommonHTML output. The CommonHTML output now provides the same layout quality and MathML support as the HTML-CSS and SVG output. It is on average 40% faster than the other outputs and the markup it produces are identical on all browsers and thus can also be pre-generated on the server via MathJax-node.\n  [CommonHTML] is MathJax\u2019s primary output mode since MathJax version 2.6. Its major advantage is its quality, consistency, and the fact that its output is independent of the browser, operating system, and user environment\n So not only is it explicitly possible to have a server-generated math output,but the algorithm that would be used for generating such output is alreadyin use on the client-side! If you look hard enough, you may even find a fewresources for using this algorithm server-side, but many of those suffer fromanother problem\u2026\n  It\u2019s tempting to convert mathematics to an image, such as a PNG or an SVG file.This approach is taken on  this blog and this  Advanced Web Machinery article.  Wolfram MathWorld also render their mathematics to images. However, in my opion,this is  not the right approach. It is inconvenient for me as a user,and, I suspect, for those in need of assistive technologies. Here arethe issues I see with rendering mathematics to images:\n Images are impossible to use with copy/paste. I am unable to select a word,number, or symbol in a rendered image. I do this on occasion, and this isnot a contrived issue.\n Images are not nearly as responsive, and are difficult to style.Line breaking, fonts, and even colors are difficult to change when using images.They stick out like a sore thumb when used for inline math, and canlook very strange (or disappear) if a user extension manipulates colors on thepage.\n Images are completely opaque to users in need of screen readers. Whilesome readers support  MathML,   [note:MathML is an XML-based markup for mathematics, meant to serve as a low-levelouput target for other math processors. While it is supported in Firefox,it requires a Polyfill in Chrome, and brings us back to front-end JavaScript. ] images are much harder to work with. The sitesthat I linked that use images do not have captions with their math,making it completely inaccessible.\n Using images instead of a JavaScript-based renderer reminds me ofthe  false dichotomy fallacy. Why can\u2019t we do what we do,but using the server?\n  If you look up \u201cmathjax setup\u201d on Google, you are greeted with dozensof links telling you how to get the rendering working client-side. It\u2019sconvenient: a single JavaScript  &lt;src&gt; tag, and maybe a bit of codeat the bottom of the page with some settings.\n If you look up \u201cmathjax render server-side\u201d, the resources are far morescarce. In fact, the first two image-based solutions I presented to youcame up as results after such a search. One more website looks promising: Antoine Amarilli\u2019s blog post about server-side rendering.The page promises a self-hosted way of generating HTML using  mathjax-node,and even provides a very compelling sample output. I decided to tryout this approach, but to no avail. First of all, the MathJax infrastructurehas changed:\n As mathjax has reorganized their repositories, to make the following work, you will probably need to install manually mathjax-node-cli, as well as maybe installing mathjax-node and possibly mathjax-node-page. Again, I haven\u2019t tried it. Thanks again to Ted for pointing this out!\n This was indeed the case. The bigger issue, though, was that the  page2htmlprogram, which rendered all the mathematics in a single HTML page,was gone. I found  tex2html and  text2htmlcss, which could onlyrender equations without the surrounding HTML. I also found  mjpage,which replaced mathematical expressions in a page with their SVG forms.This actually looked quite good - the SVGs even had labels with theiroriginal LaTeX code. However, those labels were hard to read (likelyespecially so for people using screen readers), and the SVG imagesotherwise maintained most of the issues I described above. Additionally,  the page behaved significantly more sluggishly after the initial render than the JavaScript-based alternative.   [note:This is purely anecdotal, and would require a more thorough analysis togeneralize. ]\n In short, it\u2019s much harder to find resources for server-side LaTeX rendering.It is especially hard to find such resources that work with morethan static pages. I could probably use a regular expression to extractmath I need to render from HTML, call  tex2htmlcss on it, and splice it backinto the page. But how could a WordPress user render their math? Whatabout someone writing their blog engine like I did in my youth? Somehow,those of us wanting to give our users a better experience are leftfumbling for an alternative, more or less without outside help\u2026\n  The majority of websites today use client-side, JavaScript-based renderingtechniques for mathematics. The work that could be done by a serveris outsorced to thousands of browsers, who have to run the same codeto get  identical results. Somehow, this is the best solution -the most accessible alternatives use images, which are a downgradeto the user experience. I wish for server-side rendering to becomemore common, and better documented.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:31:52", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "2020,\u6e32\u67d3,math", "title": "\u7f51\u4e0a\u6570\u5b66\u6e32\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\uff082020\uff09 ", "title_en": "Problems with math rendering on the web (2020)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://danilafe.com/blog/math_rendering_is_wrong/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["2020", "\u6e32\u67d3", "math"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "719dcf5cd02261fe43e602a5fdba0d11.jpg", "infoid": 1068435, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u57282009\u5e74\u6210\u7acb\uff0cDoximity\u662f\u533b\u751f\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u3002 \u5b83\u5728\u5176\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u670980\uff05\u7684\u7f8e\u56fd\u533b\u751f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u57282020\u5e74\u7684\u6536\u5165\u4e3a200\u7c73+\u3002......  \u9605\u8bfb\u66f4\u591a  \u79d1\u7f57\u62c9\u591a\u5dde\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5e73\u7b49\u85aa\u916c\u6cd5 - \u4ee5\u53ca\u989d\u5916\u7684\u5b98\u50da\u4e3b\u4e49 - \u6b63\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u56fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u6c11\u7684\u504f\u8fdc\u5de5\u7a0b\u673a\u4f1a\u3002 ......  \u9605\u8bfb\u66f4\u591a  VR\u4ecd\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u201c\u6740\u624b\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u201d\u3002 \u5fc3\u4e2d\u548c\u51a5\u60f3\u7b54\u6848\u5417\uff1f ......  \u9605\u8bfb\u66f4\u591a  \u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u75ab\u82d7\u5361\uff0c\u800c\u7ebd\u7ea6\u4f7f\u7528Excelsior Pass\u3002 \u5982\u679c\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u7387\u7ee7\u7eed\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u5219\u53ef\u80fd\u91cd\u8981\u3002 ...... \n\u9605\u8bfb\u66f4\u591a  \u725b\u8089\u4ef7\u683c\u98d9\u5347......\u548c\u59274\u4ef6\u8089\u888b\uff08\u5609\u5409\uff0c\u6770\u5e03\uff0c\u6cf0\u68ee\u98df\u54c1\uff0c\u56fd\u5bb6\u725b\u8089\uff09\u6b63\u5728\u62c9\u52a8\u5229\u6da6\u3002 ......  \u9605\u8bfb\u66f4\u591a  \u4f26\u6566\u827a\u672f\u5bb6Stacie McCormick\u6210\u7acb\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u827a\u672f\u535a\u89c8\u4f1a\uff0c\u5979\u79f0\u4e4b\u4e3a\u201c\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u548c\u6536\u85cf\u5bb6\u7684\u706b\u79cd\u201d\u3002 ......  \u9605\u8bfb\u66f4\u591a  Wayfair\u8054\u5408\u521b\u59cb\u4ebaSteven Conine\u8ba4\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7f8e\u56fd\u5c06\u4f7f\u7528\u6211\u4eec\u5bb6\u76843D\u6a21\u578b\u8d2d\u4e70\u5bb6\u5177\u3002 ......  \u9605\u8bfb\u66f4\u591a ", "note_en": "Founded in 2009, Doximity is a social network for doctors.

management products from the three largest cloud hyperscalers.\n With AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform leading the pack, cloud infrastructure providers saw spending hit $41.8bn in Q1, 35 per cent up on a year earlier  according to Canalys. While organisations employ some hedging in terms of infrastructure, when it comes to data management and analytics, it is best to stick with one player, said Sanjeev Mohan, VP analyst at Gartner.\n Although AWS, Azure, and GCP all have strengths and weaknesses in the data toolset, there was little to gain from trying to pick the best technologies from each vendor, Mohan told the Gartner Data &amp; Analytics Summit this week.\n   &#34;Tread carefully. If you&#39;re new and you say, I want to be multi-cloud, then think again. It is a full-time job keeping up with a single cloud, and understand[ing] all the nuances, [you don&#39;t have time] to go and start investing in multiple clouds.&#34;\n      While Mohan used his session to discuss the technologies offered by each of the biggest cloud providers in their data and analytics stack, which one to go with comes down to what kind of user you are.\n &#34;Any of these cloud providers will work for you from a business point of view, the question is more non-functional: what skills do you have? If you are a Microsoft shop, then go with Azure, because you&#39;re familiar with Microsoft tools. If you have a very sophisticated IT shop and you want a vast breadth of products and you are happy to do a lot of engineering then AWS provides you with more choices. If you are open source as a department, then Google Cloud,&#34; Mohan said.\n   If you&#39;re into picking your cloud provider for a data platform, Mohan offered a long list of criteria, including consistency, open source vs proprietary, ease of deployment, data ingest, data access, performance, scalability, and so on.\n Just because you&#39;re in their cloud doesn&#39;t mean you have to go with the multibillion-dollar provider&#39;s data tools either. After a bit of fence sitting and hand wringing about not being &#34;unfair to hundreds of products that we cover on weekly basis on non-native tools,&#34; Mohan conceded that Informatica has a vast array of data engineering products. Apache Kafka, Snowflake, and newbie data ingestion unicorn Fivetran got honourable mentions too.\n   But let&#39;s not forget old friends. Despite the stratospheric rise and ungainly fall of Hadoop, the stacks of the main cloud providers offer traces of a few hidden elephants. Microsoft, for example, has Hadoop buried in managed service HDInsight. Once relying on Hortonworks, it now uses a Microsoft distro. AWS has Elastic MapReduce, a managed Hadoop and Spark service for batch and online processing. Similarly, Google relies on Hadoop, the distributed file system it inspired, in its Dataproc tool for creating persistent objects, as well as in Data Fusion, a data transformation product. \u00ae\n     UK artists seek &#39;luvvie levy&#39; on new gadgets to make up for all the media that consumers access online\n     Leading lights in the world of &#34;the arts&#34; have called for a techy tax on mobiles, laptops, and PCs to help finance creative industries they claim have been ravaged by lack of revenue and funding.\n  DACS \u2013 the visual artists&#39; rights management nonprofit \u2013 reckons a levy of 1-2 per cent on the sale of new tech gadgets could help raise \u00a3250m-\u00a3300m a year.\n  Part of the reasoning behind the initiative, it said, is that it would help redress the balance caused by people accessing music, films, and other creative material online without paying for it directly.\n  Continue reading\n  Panasonic&#39;s Toughbook G2 tablet will feature 10-finger touch even with gloves on and full Windows 11 compatibility.\n  Continue reading\n  Bezos v Branson: Battle of the wannabe Space Barons as Virgin Galactic cleared by FAA to start flying customers\n     A pair of rich white men look set to duke it out at the edge of space after Virgin Galactic was given the green light by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to fly customers to space.\n  Continue reading\n  Fujitsu wins \u00a39m contract hike for Oracle HR system running nearly 3 years late at Northern Ireland Education Authority\n     Fujitsu has been awarded a \u00a39.2m contract extension by the Northern Ireland Education Authority for changes to the implementation of an Oracle HR and payroll system that is already nearly three years late.\n  The project \u2013 first known as the EA Integrated Financial Management Information System, now dubbed EA One Project \u2013 began in 2015 with a \u00a320m contract award to the Japanese supplier. But, according to  a tender award notice published last week, the authority said the new award was necessary to &#34;facilitate functionality changes to effectively meet schools&#39; requirements, data migration issues due to the complexity of the variations in employee terms and conditions, and project delays due to COVID-19 lockdowns.&#34;\n  The notice continued: &#34;This modification will enable the continuation of the existing single contractor managed service arrangement which includes the supply of a broad range of computer and related services, information technology consultancy services and the supply of computer hardware, software and associated products.\n  Continue reading\n  When free and open source actually means \u00a36k-\u00a38k per package: Atos&#39;s \u00a3136m contract with NHS England\n  &#39;All software must be safely and securely deployed within guidelines provided to us,&#39; says outsourcer\n     French outsourcer Atos has been charging NHS England between \u00a36,000 and \u00a38,000 for packing up popular free and open-source software requested by workers in the non-departmental government body.\n  According to documents seen by  The Register, data workers in NHS England have to request FOSS packages via their line management. These are fulfilled by outsourcer Atos, as part of  its \u00a3136m agreement with the Department of Health and Social Care signed in June 2019.\n  Analysts within NHS England who work on strategic planning of one of the world&#39;s largest public health systems, as well as assisting with the COVID-19 response, have requested common, freely available open-source packages such as R, the statistical language, and Python, the general-purpose language.\n  Continue reading\n  The UK&#39;s financial watchdog has fired a warning shot across the bow of Binance, and ordered it to place a notice on binance.com scaring off Brit crypto fans.\n  This seems to have come about because Binance, which is ultimately based in the Cayman Islands, wanted to launch an exchange in the UK using its London-based affiliate Binance Markets Ltd. Since the start of the year, cryptocurrency firms in Britain have had to register with the nation&#39;s Financial Conduct Authority and meet its anti-money-laundering and anti-terrorism-funding requirements.\n  Binance hasn&#39;t done this yet, or as the FCA itself put it, Binance has demonstrated an &#34;imposition&#34; to the regulator&#39;s rules.\n  Continue reading\n  We hope this hotel has a nice spa because Windows sure looks like it needs some R&amp;R\n     Bork!Bork!Bork! Microsoft Windows is notable for its ability to fall over pretty much anywhere, but this is, we think, the first time it has disgraced itself over the side of a hotel.\n  &#34;The 4 star hotel is using a 2 star OS for its signage, it seems,&#34; said our reader, who spotted the borkage over the weekend, smeared up against the wall of the Mercure Bridgwater in Somerset, England.\n  Continue reading\n  A study by freshwater crustacean boffins in Florida has revealed that feeding antidepressants to crayfish can make them more outgoing and adventurous \u2014 which is more or less a definition of how antidepressants are supposed to work. On humans, at least.\n  The experiment set out to investigate how exposure to antidepressants might affect crayfish behaviour in the wild, since human pharmaceutical pollutants are an increasing factor in freshwater environments.\n  To do this, they created \u201c20 oval-shaped recirculating artificial streams,\u201d each of which they filled with 60 litres of chemical-free groundwater. In each artificial stream, they built a shelter at one end for the crayfish to start in, which led to two separate paths: one flavoured with fish gelatin to signal a source of food; the other populated by another crayfish to potentially provoke an aggressive response.\n  Continue reading\n  The M in M1 is for moans: How do you turn a new MacBook Pro into a desktop workhorse?\n     The M1 MacBook Pro is like that brilliant colleague who insists on microwaving fish in the office kitchenette. Good at its job, certainly, but also deeply annoying.\n  On one hand, this machine is a veritable beast. It&#39;s fast, quiet, and has the best battery life of any machine this reviewer has used. Yet it suffers from two distinct flaws. First, it is reliant on just two USB-C (in this case, Thunderbolt 4) ports for external expandability. Secondly, for whatever reason, it natively supports just one external display.\n  Fortunately, these are fairly straightforward to circumvent, provided you&#39;ve got some deep pockets. A few weeks ago, Anker sent us  its PowerExpand 5-in-1 Thunderbolt 4 dock to review. Priced at \u00a3200, it&#39;s not cheap.\n  Continue reading\n  Sponsored With the progress of clouds, organizing IT infrastructure is no harder than organizing pizza delivery.\n  According to MarketsandMarkets, by the end of 2021, cloud data centers will process over 94% of the total workload. It\u2019s easy to explain why businesses migrate to clouds: companies like how simple it is to rent capacities and solutions from providers. However, all that is more relevant to virtual machines.\n  The situation around dedicated servers is not as simple. They are, however, still indispensable for certain tasks, and allow client\u2019s business to get the most out of its infrastructure. Our review of bare metal servers will show their advantages, when they are indispensable and how to seamlessly integrate them into corporate IT infrastructure.\n  Continue reading\n  Hubble telescope in another tight spot: Between astrophysicists sparring over a &#39;dark matter deficient&#39; galaxy\n  One team says DF2 is 72m LY away, another disagrees \u2013 we speak to both sides\n     Never mind memory errors from radiation. Another deteriorating part of the decades-old Hubble Space Telescope has found itself in a jam. This time its camera unit is once again in the middle of a clash between scientists over whether or not the galaxy NGC 1052-DF2 contains any dark matter.\n  When DF2 was  written up in a  Nature paper in 2018, the study immediately raised eyebrows. The paper concluded the galaxy was devoid of dark matter. How could that be possible?\n  The mysterious substance is thought to be present in all galaxies, holding together glittering stars, swirls of dust and gas, and more, giving the galaxies structure and shape.

", "note_en": "\u201cThe Martian\u201d by Andy Weir, and its  film adaptation directed by Ridley Scott, remain some of my all time favorite science fiction works. Way back in the day  I wrote a technical commentary. I last read the book in 2015 (until 2 weeks ago) and watched the film in 2018.\n More recently I\u2019ve been exploring in detail how  Starship changes the game with Lunar exploration and began to wonder what \u201cThe Martian\u201d would look like with a Starship-based architecture, rather than the rather more expensive and complex architecture used in the book.\n   The book is not entirely self-consistent in its architecture, but to recap, about 25 launches of an Atlas V-like booster are used to assemble the parts and supplies for a 6 person trip to Mars. Each trip takes 4 years and provides a 30 day stay on the surface. Amortizing the Hermes cost over 5 missions, each mission works out to be about $30b, or $166m per person per day on Mars. This is a conservative estimate \u2013 in Chapter 12 Lewis says \u201cUncle Sam paid a hundred thousand dollars for every second we\u2019ll be here\u201d which works out to be about $260b for the whole program, or $65b/year. Either total is quite ambitious in the context of NASA\u2019s current budget!\n In contrast, a Starship-based mission is optimized for high volume cargo delivery to the Martian surface. With cargo costs around $1000/kg, extended crewed missions and even city building become the most natural activity, and personnel costs drop from O($1000/s) to O($1000/day). This makes a big difference!\n  Unlike the Martian, there is only one new space vehicle, instead of five or six. The marginal unit cost is perhaps $10m, instead of $5b. It\u2019s rapidly reusable, and delivers cargo in 100 T lots to the surface. Unfortunately for \u201cThe Martian\u201d, Starship edition, the loss of programmatic brittleness and overwhelming system complexity means that the plot can\u2019t rely on steadily ricocheting between various  MacGuffins and science-based exposition. Or at least, not in the same way.\n Instead, it has to contend with the somewhat less familiar trope of a lonely human in a post-scarcity landscape. In some ways, this may enable a more thorough examination of the human condition but it also presents challenges for plot motivation.\n  For completeness, here\u2019s the Mars-Earth and Earth-Mars  \u201cporkchop\u201d plot for the 2020s. Broadly speaking, launches are only advisable in the blue regions.\n      Six days into what should be the greatest month of my life, and it\u2019s turned into a nightmare.\n I got loaded up at the departure night celebration. 550 days on Mars, time to head home. Took the rover for a spin around the base to get one last look at the Martian horizon, homed in on the Starship that will take us home, crawled into my bunk, and went to sleep.\n Next morning I woke up and realize that I\u2019m not in space. Well, I am in space, in the sense that everything is in space somewhere, but I\u2019m still in a Starship that\u2019s parked on Mars. Did we delay our launch for some reason? No.\n No we didn\u2019t. I looked out the window and on the other side of the main drag saw a blackened spot where the other ERV Starship launched, oh, 6 hours before. It didn\u2019t wake me.\n It takes a while to make the 1200 T of fuel needed to fuel up one of these bad boys and fly home, so in the meantime I\u2019m apparently stranded here on a planet with nothing but 5000 T of cargo for company and a 300 day wait until the next crew arrives.\n But that\u2019s not the funny part. The funny part is that the cargo manifest database has been corrupted. Within 2 miles of my current position there are a few dozen Starships still loaded to the gills with everything a growing Mars base could possibly need. Pallets of light bulbs. Container loads of robots. Several dozen robotic machines capable of basically any action given the right instructions.\n I can search the database and verify that I have something like 10,000 days of food supply \u2013 surely enough to see me out \u2013 but without unloading every last Starship my odds of finding any of it is vanishingly small. Just the thought of all those lonely sandwiches and croissants made my stomach pinch a little.\n Here I am, a tiny dragon on an unbelievable hoard, and I don\u2019t know where anything is.\n  The Hab shook in the roaring wind as the astronauts huddled in the center. All six of them now wore their flight space suits, in case they had to scramble for an emergency takeoff in the MAV. Johanssen watched her laptop while the rest watched her.\n \u201cSustained winds over one hundred kph now,\u201d she said. \u201cGusting to one twenty-five.\u201d\n \u201cJesus, we\u2019re gonna end up in Oz,\u201d Watney said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the abort wind speed?\u201d\n \u201cTechnically one fifty kph,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cAny more than that and the Starship\u2019s in danger of tipping.\u201d\n  \u201cSorry, commander,\u201d Martinez conceded. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, Watney. This is Mars. The low atmospheric density means that 150 kph wind is barely perceptible. Nothing is going to tip the Starship.\u201d\n \u201cI guess I look pretty silly wearing a flight suit 12 months before we\u2019re due to launch?\u201d Watney asked.\n    I\u2019d better run diagnostics on the failed communications system. It sure looks like that latest software update bricked it. Seems unlikely that NASA would ship a patch that broke stuff permanently, but then again, who really understands Linux these days anyway?\n Now I\u2019m faced with a dilemma. Hunt through various bins of contraband USB drives looking for an earlier form of the software so I can manually reflash the ROM, or hack literally any of the thousands of radios within easy reach.\n Thousands of radios? Well, yes. Bluetooth? Radio. Wifi? Radio. GSM? Radio. 5G? Radio. Zigbee? Radio. Asset trackers? Radio. Radio radio radio. But in this brave new world of ours, all our Internet of Shit devices come with radios built in. It\u2019s a security nightmare. But only the USB drives are forbidden\u2026\n Of course, a 2 W cellular transmitter is hardly capable of streaming live video all the way back to Earth, but the  Shannon-Hartley theorem shows you can still transmit data over a very noisy channel. I\u2019ll put a sacrificial IoT radio in some kind of cantenna, load up the WSPR error correcting software, and start transmitting a status beacon. Back of the envelope math suggests I can send and receive a few thousand bits a day, which when combined with a submarine code book I have handy will be adequate to keep the lights on until I can locate that pallet of spare Starlink receivers.\n Would I write my own coding system using the ASCII alphabet? Why would I inflate a 26 character alphabet that\u2019s already pretty redundant to 256 characters? To reserve 90% of my channel for umlauts so that NASA can write \u00a3\u00a2~\u221a\u00b0\u00a9%}} without any ambiguity? Please!\n And of course it\u2019s trivially easy to network all the local radios, so I don\u2019t have to do an EVA to a nearby rover to check my email. What is this, 1982?\n  Let\u2019s think about this methodically. Today I suited up, picked a cargo Starship at random, drove to its base, activated the external lift, and was gently lifted up into its cavernous cargo hold. Except that it was so full I could barely see in, let alone climb around, and every cargo pallet was wrapped in an opaque white pressure sleeve to prevent vacuum exposure. Naturally, every cargo pallet was also annotated with a giant QR code describing the contents, which I am unable to decode because my eyes are not pixelated. Useful.\n I unloaded a pallet onto the tray of my rover, drove it back to the Hab and into the airlock, then broke through the seal to find \u2026 bearings. I now have 10,000 bearings of various sizes. And zero nutritional content.\n Let\u2019s do the math. I can unload 4 pallets a day, and my Hab can contain perhaps 20 before it is too full to move. Each Starship contains 200 pallets, so\u2026 this approach does not scale. My odds of finding a pallet I can metabolize before I die of old age are looking pretty slim.\n Time to think bigger. Somewhere in those Starships are the materials to build a large pressurized tent easily big enough to contain all the cargo. Originally, we were meant to do some prospecting and the next crew would deploy the base materials, so that the crew up here was never material constrained.\n  I cracked open my laptop and started hacking. First, there\u2019s no reason I have to physically be present at a Starship to unload it. Obviously something needs to collect each pallet of cargo or else they\u2019ll pile up at the base, but I dropped some code on each rover enabling it to coordinate with the Starship cargo crane to synchronize position and procure a pallet.\n Because it\u2019s the future, everything is covered in cameras and I can easily oversee and tweak the process as it goes along. My fleet of rovers is already in the process of ransacking every Starship in sight, driving their cargo to a selected location, and dropping it on the ground.\n Which means that, in my quasi-isolated state, I\u2019m deciding where the first Mars base is actually going to be built. So I\u2019m picking the spot with a good view.\n After a week or so of continuous operations, all 5000 T of cargo is now knolled in neat rows where I can drive back and forth on the open rover.\n In my hand as I drive is an X-Ray Fluorescence gun, designed to perform contactless assays of near-surface minerals for prospecting, and, in this case, unmarked cargo bales. After 45 minutes of driving up and down the rows mindlessly irradiating this already irradiated frozen desert hellscape, I finally got what I\u2019d been looking for \u2013 a strong fluorine signature.\n Fluorine is ordinarily a rather antisocial little atom but substituting for hydrogen in polymers makes a very UV and chemical resistant substance. I cut through the packaging and found \u2026\n Teflon cookware. Okay, I\u2019m on the right track, but I\u2019m not opening a shop today. Back to driving.\n The sun was setting in the west when I got my second hit. This time, I hit pay dirt. Reinforced PTFE tent material. Acres of the stuff. I forked the package to the center of the cargo midden and turned in for the night.\n Before I went to sleep I tasked a rover to fit the entrenching tool and excavate the perimeter of the new enclosure.\n Next morning I drove back to the site and found my path blocked by a trench. Duh. I filled in a bit, then XRF gun in hand I found the wall anchor pallets, buried them in the trench, then pulled the tent materials out from the center to the edges where it zipped together.\n I\u2019m making it sound easy. It would be impossible, except I\u2019m the sole planetary heir to a boatload of stuff intended to replicate the entire industrial revolution in a year or two. So it was merely a pain in the ass. At times the effort of moving a joystick to drive the enormous and powerful vehicles around caused me to mist up my helmet.\n See instruction manual steps 12-20 for a riveting account of what happened next: All my cargo was now under a 20 acre inflatable enclosure. Inside, the greenhouse effect began to warm things up a bit so they were no longer incredibly cold \u2013 merely ordinarily cold.\n My jury rigged inflation set up provided enough pressure to protect the cargo so I proceeded to open every last pallet. This I did by hand. With a chain saw. I\u2019m not a barbarian, and there are like a thousand pallets to open. But a rover-mounted robot chainsaw is too metal, even for me.\n When all was said and done, I basically had the world\u2019s loneliest and most poorly organized open-air bazaar full of stuff that was mostly, though not entirely, recognizable by sight. I unpacked the life support physical plant gear, got it set up, and when the interior was shirt sleeves compatible, rebuilt my cargo manifest by hand.\n I worked in a supermarket as a kid. This was like a stock take, except that making it up before the shift ended wasn\u2019t a viable strategy anymore.\n I had spent ten weeks getting everything unpacked and when I was done, I got a reply to my beacon. NASA thoughtfully sent me the manifest database decryption passcode in plaintext. It was \u201ccargo_manifest_123\u201d. So now I know where everything was on the now empty Starships. Great.\n I was pleasantly surprised that so much could be done so quickly with so few people. Soon they\u2019ll be building new Mars cities without bothering to send any astronauts at all. Even better.\n  Mindy Park moved on to perusing the rest of the image. The Hab was intact of course, why wouldn\u2019t it be? Aliens? Dr. Kapoor would be happy to see that anyway.\n    \u201cDr Kapoor, not urgent but I noticed that activity at the base has been continuing since the crew left, are the robotics teams proceeding? If so, why are they siting what seem to be cargo pallets in the backup city site location? And in the shape of a giant \u2026\u201d\n   \u201cYeah,\u201d Mitch said. \u201cHow long are we gonna keep this from the Ares 3 crew? They all think Watney\u2019s dead. It\u2019s a huge drain on morale.\u201d\n   \u201cNo, you discussed it,\u201d Mitch interrupted. \u201cThey think they lost a crewmate. They\u2019re devastated.\u201d\n \u201cAnd when they find out they abandoned a crewmate?\u201d Venkat asked. \u201cWill they feel better then?\u201d\n Mitch poked the table with his finger. \u201cThey deserve to know. You think Commander Lewis can\u2019t handle the truth?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of morale,\u201d Venkat said. \u201cThey can concentrate on getting home\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI make that call,\u201d Mitch said. \u201cI\u2019m the one who decides what\u2019s best for the crew. And I say we bring them up to speed.\u201d\n    Venkat looked at Mitch. \u201cI thought we controlled all the data flowing to and from the  Hermes?\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re elite technical experts,\u201d Mitch replied, \u201cThey can set up a VPN. Their browser traffic is encrypted. It\u2019s not hard. My 8 year old does it to stream Netflix shows from Europe.\u201d\n     Lewis: Someone *cough @AstroJohannsen cough* said she verified Mark was in his bunk before we launched. Looks like we left him behind. Whoops. Sorry @NASA.\n   \u201cVenkat, we may have a problem. I manifested an additional 100 kg of pasta for the early resupply.\u201d\n     \u201cClassic error. We\u2019ve all done it. And would you believe, Amazon Prime\u2019s return policy from Mars isn\u2019t much good.\u201d\n  \u201cHardly! This isn\u2019t the 1900s with their primitive expendable rockets. Logistics is practically below the API nowadays. And NASA never complains about getting the extra miles!\u201d\n \u201cI remember those days. We drilled holes in everything to save weight, even the spaghetti!\u201d\n \u201cNot the astronauts, though, they always squealed when we tried to remove redundant anatomical systems to save weight.\u201d\n \u201cWell 100 T of pasta is a big mistake, but at least you didn\u2019t accidentally miscount your crew before pressing the big red button.\u201d\n   \u201cGood point, why not send her back out with the next crew? I\u2019ll run it by Mitch. He\u2019ll love it.\u201d\n    \u201cYes, I think we can retcon a regulation stipulating that crew members may only re-enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere provided all living members are physically present.\u201d\n   \u201cYes. I appreciate the sacrifice but can you imagine NASA would have ever begun a crewed Mars campaign without the ability to lift a million tonnes a year to orbit? Including oddly large orders of pasta?\u201d\n \u201cI think they want to participate, but they would have to sacrifice their probe.\u201d\n \u201cWhy? NASA, Russia, ESA, JAXA, hell, even the Australian Space Agency could launch it for them. When is the next Starship flight in their direction?\u201d\n \u201cCurrent policy is no fewer than one Starship per planet per launch window, so we have half a dozen opportunities in the next year. Can we pencil them in?\u201d\n     I\u2019ve had some time on my hands. Well, that\u2019s one way of putting it. Now that NASA\u2019s communications system is back up, they won\u2019t stop driving every robot they can get their hands on to do stuff. Do you know how annoying it is to find your rover drove off in the middle of the night and insists it can\u2019t return until it\u2019s torqued 13,000 bolts on some obscure production line?\n Can you believe how failure prone that rover\u2019s radio turned out to be? Rover antenna in hand, I drove my Mars car around my growing base and allowed my mind to wander.\n So here I am. An overproductive fuel plant, a bunch of robotic robot factories, a small decorative lake that is yet to be stocked with fish, and a few dozen empty Starships waiting in a bone yard to be scrapped for parts some day.\n Each has 8 little legs that fold out under the skirt and can adjust position to ensure stable landings on uneven ground. I found that the relevant accelerometer was not as well bolted down as it should be, and devised a cunning plan.\n Standing on the Starship\u2019s flight deck, I activating landing mode, put the accelerometer in my hand, turned on some sweet beats, and started wiggling that little sensor around.\n The Starship computer thought the ground was doing something very funny and moved the legs to compensate. And slowly, slowly, the entire spaceship began to shuffle across the landscape. I was halfway to the launching pad before the beat even dropped.\n Once there I dumped the fuel plant tanks into the Starship, climbed aboard, and pressed the big red button. Sitting atop 9.5 km/s of dispatchable delta-V, where was I going to go?\n 8 minutes later I was in a nice polar Low Mars Orbit. After this it was an exercise in Kerbal Space Program. I boosted out, changed planes, aerobraked back in, orbited Phobos, landed for a couple of days, walked around, flew to Deimos, same deal, then went back to LMO. I still had enough fuel practically to fly back to Earth but the launch window wasn\u2019t quite right. So I dumped a few hundred tons of prop and re-entered, landing back on the launch pad. I unstowed my safely hijacked rover from the skirt cargo bin and drove back into town.\n  Soon enough the next window opened up and the next lot of cargo began to rain down from above. I drove out to a nearby hill so I could watch them come in in batches of 6 or 7, every morning just before lunch time. Soon the dusty old bone yard was joined by a few dozen more Starships, this time with their manifests intact.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:29:25", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u706b\u661f,martian,\u661f\u8230", "title": "\u201c\u706b\u661f\u201d+\u661f\u8230 ", "title_en": "\u201cThe Martian\u201d + Starship", "transed": 1, "url": "https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2021/04/09/the-martian-starship/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u706b\u661f", "martian", "\u661f\u8230"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "737a1cb5374b38efa654668d82b1416d.png", "infoid": 1068430, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u54e6\uff0c\u770b\uff0c\u75af\u72c2\u7684Microsoft Build\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\uff01\u4eca\u5e74\u7684Microsoft Build\u662f\uff0c\u4f60\u77e5\u9053\uff0c\u518d\u6b21\u5168\u90e8\u865a\u62df\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9.NET\u548cWSL\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u6211\u53d1\u73b0\u6574\u4e2a\u4f1a\u8bae\u4e2d\u63d0\u5230\u4e86\u6ca1\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u7684Windows\u5f00\u53d1\u4ee4\u4eba\u5931\u671b\u3002\u5b83\u8ba9\u6211\u8ba9\u6211\u60f3\u5ff52019\u5e74\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6211\u4ecd\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u4ece\u6211\u7684\u5e08\u7236\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u8fc7\u6765\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u7684\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\u5728\u5efa\u9020\u4f1a\u8bae\u671f\u95f4\u6b7b\u4ea1;\u6211\u53ea\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4eca\u5e74\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6458\u8981\u3002\u597d\u5427\uff0c\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u6f5c\u5165\u3002\n   \u4e3a\u4e86\u6211\u7684\u5931\u671b\uff0c\u8fd9\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u592a\u591a\u65b0\u7684\u3002\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u901a\u5e38\u7f29\u5199\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5230\u76ee\u524d\u4e3a\u6b62\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982WSLG\u548c\u201cWSL  -  Install`\u3002\u6211\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u65b0\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u662f\u4f7f\u7528WSLG\u4f7f\u7528WSL\u4e2d\u7684WSL\u4e2d\u200b\u200b\u4f7f\u7528\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u8bd5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\n   \u5173\u4e8e.NET\u7684\u4f1a\u8bdd\u5305\u88c5\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6709\u51e0\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u5b83\u7684\u4f1a\u8bdd\u6570\u3002 .NET\u5347\u7ea7\u52a9\u624b\uff08\u5e2e\u52a9\u5c06.NET\u9879\u76ee\u5347\u7ea7\u5230\u6700\u65b0\u7248\u672c\uff09\u662f\u6211\u5c06\u6211\u7684\u65e7\u9879\u76ee\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u66f4\u65b0\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u4e14.NET 6\u4e0e\u5176\u5355\u5806\u53e0\uff08\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u4e2aSDK\uff0cBCL\uff0cToolchain\uff09\u5e73\u53f0\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\u4f7f\u5b83\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u524d\u9014\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4ece\u4f1a\u8bdd\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u603b\u7ed3\uff1a ", "note_en": "Oh, look, a wild Microsoft Build appeared! The Microsoft Build this year was, you know, all virtual again. As a person who is more interested in .NET and WSL development, I find it disappointing that not much of Windows development is mentioned in the entire conference. It made me miss  Build 2019. While I am still not recovered from my master\u2019s study, my laptop died right during the Build conference; I can only provide a straightforward summary of this year\u2019s Build. Well, I think let\u2019s dive in.\n   To my disappointment, there is not much new in this build. This build generally recapped everything we have so far, such as WSLg and ``wsl --install`. The only new thing I noticed is Visual Studio\u2019s ability to debug using the browser in WSL using WSLg.\n   The sessions about .NET is packed with information, although there is nearly 1-digit number of sessions about it. .NET Upgrade Assistant (Help upgrade .NET project to latest version) would be possibly a great tool for me to migrate my old projects to newer version, and .NET 6 with its Single stack (only one SDK, BCL, Toolchain for cross-platform) structure made it looks really promising.

While serious early glitches have been worked out, significant issues remain, according to the article. Amazon is reportedly unconcerned about the hiccups and bad press that result so long as sufficient numbers of drivers are available to replace those whose accounts are mistakenly terminated.\n \u201cExecutives knew this was gonna shit the bed,\u201d\u00a0a former engineer who designed the system told Bloomberg.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s actually how they put it in meetings. The only question was how much poo we wanted there to be.\u201d\n  The e-commerce giant  started Flex in 2015 to handle surges of packages and two-hour deliveries for its Prime Now service. Today, it also coordinates deliveries for Whole Foods grocery orders. (If you\u2019re curious to hear details about how the system functions when it&#39;s working, Ars\u2019 own Sam Machkovech  went gonzo a few years ago and worked a shift as a driver.) During the pandemic, the Flex program became an increasingly important part of the retailer\u2019s logistics program, so much so that it  offered Flex drivers a bonus to work at least 20 hours in December 2020. \u00a0 Flex hirings, performance reports, and firings are all handled by software, with minimal intervention by humans. Drivers sign up and upload required documents via a smartphone app, through which they also sign up for shifts, coordinate deliveries, and report problems. It\u2019s also how drivers monitor their ratings, which fall into four broad buckets\u2014Fantastic, Great, Fair, or At Risk. Flex drivers are assessed on a range of variables, including on-time performance, details like whether the package is sufficiently hidden from the street, and a driver\u2019s ability to fulfill customer requests.\n    Amazon refutes the idea that drivers have been unfairly treated. \u201cWe have invested heavily in technology and resources to provide drivers visibility into their standing and eligibility to continue delivering, and investigate all driver appeals,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Kate Kudrna told Bloomberg.\n  Former Flex drivers interviewed by Bloomberg and driver reports posted on forums across the Internet reveal an opaque system that often leaves them guessing as to why their ratings dropped or why their accounts were terminated\u2014effectively firing them from the job.\n Neddra Lira, a former driver interviewed by Bloomberg, said her ratings tanked after she had to return packages to the warehouse when she found a nail in her tire. She managed to raise her rating to \u201cgreat\u201d over the next several weeks only to have her account terminated for violating terms of service. She appealed the termination, but Amazon didn\u2019t budge.\n Another driver Bloomberg spoke with, Stephen Normandin, had trouble delivering packages to Phoenix-area apartment complexes before dawn. The gates were still locked, the offices were closed, and package recipients weren\u2019t answering their phones. In another apartment complex, an Amazon locker wouldn\u2019t open for him. His rating also suffered in the wake of those problems, and he spent six weeks reviving it\u2014only to be terminated days later because his rating had \u201cdropped below an acceptable level.\u201d\n  The reasons Amazon gives for firing Flex workers don\u2019t always appear to match the true reason for the termination. One driver posting on reddit said they were terminated because, according to the Flex app, the selfies they took to verify their identity at the start of the shift didn\u2019t match the driver\u2019s license photo they uploaded when they set up the account. The driver wasn\u2019t buying it, though, since in the shift they worked before being fired, packages the app assigned to them were not available at the Prime Now depot and thus were unable to be delivered. \u201cThe termination email I received this morning was sent at 1:17am, but at 1:06am, just eleven minutes before, I had also received one of those generic emails reminding me that I need to pick up all of my orders,\u201d the person  wrote. \u201cI\u2019m assuming this isn\u2019t coincidence, and even though the termination email specifically states \u2018images\u2019 as the reason for termination, I\u2019m attributing it to these \u2018missed packages.\u2019\u201d\n     Amazon started  requiring selfies in 2019 so that multiple people wouldn\u2019t share a single account. The practice may help prevent people from using other accounts to steal packages. But there are other drivers who use the practice for more legitimate purposes, including  to deliver more packages faster, which can bump up their ratings, or to fulfill deliveries  without racking up parking tickets.\n Flex drivers\u2019 forums are littered with posts from people complaining that their accounts were terminated because their selfies did not \u201cmeet the requirements for the Amazon Flex program.\u201d The photos appear to be verified by image recognition algorithms. People who have lost weight or shaved their beards or gotten a haircut have run into problems, as have drivers attempting to start a shift at night, when low lighting can result in a poor-quality selfie.\n Drivers who believe they\u2019ve been unfairly terminated have ten days to petition to have their accounts reinstated, but in that time, they cannot work any shifts. If a driver loses the appeal, they can ask for arbitration, though it costs them $200. For many drivers, who make between $18\u2013$30 per hour delivering for Flex, it\u2019s simply not worth it. For Amazon, though, botched terminations don\u2019t seem to be tempering interest in the Flex program.

My own patience ran out earlier this year while leafing through the  New York Times food section. There, in the newspaper of record, was  a recipe for savory scones with onions, currants, and caraway. Though I wasn\u2019t particularly interested in making savory scones, one passage caught my eye:\n  Add the onions to the skillet and increase the heat to medium-high. Cook until they begin to turn dark brown and somewhat soft, about 5 minutes. Add the oil and a pinch of the fine sea salt; continue cooking until the onions are soft and caramelized, about 5 minutes longer.\n    Soft, dark brown onions in five minutes. That is a lie. Fully caramelized onions in five minutes more. Also a lie.\n  There is no other word for it.\u00a0Onions do not caramelize in five or 10 minutes. They never have, they never will\u2014yet recipe writers have never stopped pretending that they will.  I went on Twitter and said so, rudely,  using CAPS LOCK. A chorus of frustrated cooks responded in kind (\u201cThat\u2019s on some bullshit. You want caramelized onions? Stir for 45 minutes\u201d).\n      As long as I\u2019ve been cooking, I\u2019ve been reading various versions of this lie, over and over. Here\u2019s Madhur Jaffrey, from her otherwise reliable  Indian Cooking, explaining how to do the onions for rogan josh: \u201cStir and fry for about 5 minutes or until the onions turn a medium-brown colour.\u201d The  Boston Globe,  on preparing pearl onions for coq au vin: \u201cAdd the onions and cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes or until golden.\u201d The  Washington Post, on  potato-green bean soup: \u201cAdd the onion and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden brown.\u201d\n    If you added all those cooking times together end to end, you still wouldn\u2019t have caramelized onions. Here, telling the truth about  how to prepare onions for French onion soup, is Julia Child: \u201c[C]ook slowly until tender and translucent, about 10 minutes. Blend in the salt and sugar, raise heat to moderately high, and let the onions brown, stirring frequently until they are a dark walnut color, 25 to 30 minutes.\u201d Ten minutes plus 25 to 30 minutes equals 35 to 40 minutes. That is how long it takes to caramelize onions.\n  Telling the truth about caramelized onions would turn a lot of dinner-in-half-an-hour recipes into dinner-in-a-little-over-an-hour recipes. I emailed\u00a0Sam Sifton, the  Times food critic turned national editor, to ask if the Recipe Writing Guild had some secret agreement to print false estimates of onion-cooking time. He wrote back: \u201cI can reveal that onion caramelization takes longer than the Guild believes. But it need not take as long as you believe it to take! You can speed it up with butter, so long as you are careful not to burn.\u201d\n      Could onions be browned, at all, in 10 minutes? I embarked on a quest to find out. Someone on Twitter had suggested things would go faster with sweet onions. This seemed a little like pepping up a bread pudding recipe by treating sliced pound cake as a kind of bread. But I bought a Tampico sweet onion, chopped half of it into tiny bits\u2014only half, so as not to crowd the pan\u2014and turned my biggest burner as high as it would go. Butter seemed a little risky at that temperature, so I went with olive oil, in a cheap, lightweight nonstick skillet. In five minutes, a few flecks of brown had appeared among the otherwise raw-looking onion bits. After eight minutes, some of the onion had begun to take on the scorched aspect of the unfortunate onions stuck to bagels. At the 10-minute mark, the brown flecks had turned black, in a mince that was a mix of brown and still-pale bits. The onion was done cooking\u2014that is, it was beginning to be ruined\u2014but it was not very well caramelized. At 11 minutes, I scraped an inedible mess out of the pan.\n    But the onion lies had not yet been fully refuted. Melissa Clark, the author of the  Times\u2019 scone recipe,  claimed in a Diner\u2019s Journal post that she relies on \u201ca somewhat unusual technique,\u201d one that \u201ctakes less than half the time of the traditional slow-cooked method of caramelization and makes for sweeter, more intensely flavored onions with a complex, chewy texture.\u201d The secret, she writes, is starting the onions in a dry pan, and adding the oil later.\n    Note that half the time of the traditional method is  still 20 minutes, not 10. Nevertheless, I decided to follow her instructions to the letter. I used a red onion, as Clark specified, \u201chalved through the root and thinly sliced crosswise.\u201d I started slicing it paper-thin. Not good enough? I got out the knife sharpener and touched up the edge on the cleaver. Now it was tissue-paper thin. I heated the pan\u2014dry\u2014over a generously medium-high flame, then added the onions.\n    After five minutes\u2014when according to Clark, it would \u201cbegin to turn dark brown and somewhat soft\u201d\u2014the onion was resolutely white and pink, and only slightly translucent. I added the oil: one tablespoon, extra-virgin. The white parts turned the color of extra-virgin olive oil.\n  At 10 minutes, when it was supposed to be done, the onion was translucent and soft, with only a tinge of gold. Soon after, one golden speck appeared. By 15 minutes, the onion was even softer and more golden. At 20 minutes, there were deep brown patches, and I was afraid they would scorch while I set down my spatula to take notes. At 24 minutes, the risk of scorching forced me to lower the heat to medium. By 25 minutes, they were pretty well caramelized, and at 28 minutes they were as done as I\u2019d want.\n      So Clark was only off by 180 percent on the cooking time. You can save 12 minutes off caramelizing onions, provided you pin yourself to the stove.\n  That is the deeper problem with all the deceit around the question of caramelized onions. The premise is wrong. The faster you try to do it, the more you waste your time. This isn\u2019t some kitchen koan. It\u2019s a practical fact. The 10-minute-cum-28-minute caramelized onion is all labor and anxiety. Give yourself 45 or 50 minutes to brown onions, working slowly on a moderate flame, and it\u2019s an untaxing background activity. You can chop other vegetables, wash some pots, duck out to have a look at the ballgame on TV in the next room. Keep half an eye on the pan. It will only need close tending toward the end.\n    Recipe writers approach kitchen time with a stopwatch. The  Times\u2019 scone recipe, as written, claimed to take 45 minutes. Once you subtract out the (fictitiously shortened) onion-cooking time, the one-minute caraway-seed-toasting time, the 15-to-17 minute baking time, and the 10-minute cooling time, that leaves the cook seven to nine minutes in the middle to mix the dough (including grating frozen butter into it), shape it, cut it into scones, and lay the scones out on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Oh, and somewhere in there, the onions needed to \u201ccool completely.\u201d Isn\u2019t home baking soothing?\n  In truth, the best time to caramelize onions is yesterday. Often enough, you need to have them ready before you can start on the rest of the dish. Thus the recipe-writers\u2019 impulse to deceive. Browning onions is slow work, and it comes first. So get a pan going after dinner, and they\u2019ll be ready when you need them. Or throw the onions in a crock pot and go to bed. In recipe time, that\u2019s hours and hours. In your time, the time that matters, it\u2019s less than five minutes.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:28:39", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4f5c\u5bb6,writers,\u6d0b\u8471", "title": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u98df\u8c31\u4f5c\u5bb6\u6492\u8c0e\u6d89\u53ca\u7126\u7cd6\u6d0b\u8471\u9700\u8981\u591a\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\uff1f \uff082012\uff09 ", "title_en": "Why do recipe writers lie about how long it takes to caramelize onions?

it\u2019s never been easier to find tortillas that smell like fresh popcorn, taste like the earth, and support small family farms in Mexico. In  certain cities, you can buy a bag of fresh masa for homemade tacos as readily as you can find sliced bread. Just a few years ago, your only options for quality tortillas were to scour the web for \u201ctortiller\u00edas nearby\u201d or ask your favorite taquero where they got theirs. So how did we get here?\n \u201cWe\u2019re in the era of third wave masa, and it\u2019s been 100 years in the making,\u201d Jorge Gaviria says, referring to a century of access to  nixtamalized masa in the United States culminating in our current golden age. As the cofounder of  Masienda, an importer of heirloom Mexican corn and high-quality tortilla equipment, he has earned the moniker of masa pioneer in the resurgence of premium masa. He likens the new demand for complex, aromatic, earthy Mexican corn to the  third wave specialty coffee movement\u2019s impact on our coffee appetites. \u201cMeticulous sourcing, single-origin, and geeking out about the process is now happening with masa,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the same kind of framework.\u201d\n  The first wave of masa in the U.S. was all about convenience, starting with the invention of Maseca, the first instant masa flour, in 1941. In the decades that followed, a second wave of brick-and-mortar tortilla shops began in states with large Mexican immigrant populations. These tortiller\u00edas make decent masa out of American commodity field corn and have been the backbone of American barrios for generations.\n  Masa\u2019s third wave is all about seeking the most flavorful corn varieties from small growers across Mexico. Two brands\u2014Masienda in the States and  Tamoa in Mexico\u2014are shaping this new standard by lugging heavy sacks of really good-tasting corn from Mexico to the U.S., all in the name of serious tortillas. As of now, these are the only companies with sufficient connections to Mexican farmers to ensure a consistent supply of heirloom corn. But they\u2019re not alone in building this wave. Tortiller\u00edas like  Three Sisters Nixtamal in Portland, Oregon, and  Kernel of Truth Organics in Los Angeles, as well as restaurants like  Suerte in Austin, are working with American farmers to make the best possible masa using domestic corn.\n   The difference in flavor between true nixtamalized masa made from heirloom organic corn versus Maseca-based tortillas made from conventional corn is like swapping supermarket white bread for a hot loaf of whole grain sourdough. The aroma, flavor, and even texture is incomparable. If you want to understand why, you can: Transparent sourcing is a keystone of this golden age.\n  In 2019, Gaviria published a  15-page report of Masienda\u2019s sourcing model, which includes an impact analysis, expenses, and portraits of their farmers. Gaviria shares that he expects his 2021 report to be published in the next month. \u201cWe have structures in place where we document how much corn we are purchasing each year from each community to understand a baseline over the course of a few years,\u201d he says. \u201cOur corporate interest is not to over-source, but balancing what we believe is an appropriate amount that still allows for individuals to supply their local community.\u201d It\u2019s a necessary check to protect a delicate ecosystem, ensuring a future not just for heirloom corn, but also for the culture and community that make it possible.\n  Appetites for quality masa on both sides of the border have been growing for years. Taco nerds in the U.S. have longed for a day where the tortilla was treated with as much respect as the juicy meat placed on it. But they had to wait until 2014 to see tortillas with an origin statement appear on an upscale restaurant menu, which came with the arrival of Mexican chef Enrique Olvera\u2019s  Cosme in New York City.\n  The idea behind Cosme\u2019s handmade tortillas was to tell a story of Mexico with each bite. Olvera, the celebrated chef behind  Pujol in Mexico City and  Damian in Los Angeles, insisted on a whole masa  program, nixtamalizing masa for tortillas and training American servers on the subtleties of regional corn varieties. The corn itself came from Masienda, which sold its first sack of Mexican corn to Cosme in 2014, marking it as one of the first Mexican restaurants in America to use real Mexican corn. Cosme\u2019s wild success sparked a new wave of interest in quality masa among the food-obsessed set. It also signaled to restaurant operators that despite the higher effort and cost, focusing on quality masa could be commercially viable. Masienda\u2019s base of customers grew, quickly, expanding into the direct-to-consumer market with varieties like chalque\u00f1o blanco and easier-to-nixtamalize blue varieties.\n The tortillas were a hit. In his   New York Times review of Cosme in 2015, restaurant critic Pete Wells described the tortillas aroma as \u201ccompletely wholesome\u2014like flowers, bread straight from the oven, and a baby\u2019s cheek at the same time.\u201d\n  In the years since, Masienda has contributed two further innovations to the golden age of masa. The first, the adorably named  Molinito, is a countertop mill that grinds tortiller\u00eda-quality masa on demand. It\u2019s the first machine of its kind designed for home or restaurant kitchens that uses stone in its grinding mechanism rather than metal burrs, essential to achieving the buttery-smooth quality of premium masa. Before the Molinito, you had to pay a lot of money to ship heavy portable grinders from Mexico or seek out hand-cranked manual grinders from mom-and-pop Mexican markets. While these types of metal grinders sufficed for the average home cook, there is something extra romantic about getting that immaculate Play-Doh that only stone grind wheels can provide. The second game changer, which, like the Molinito, came to market in 2020, is a  \u201cchef grade\u201d instant tortilla flour akin to Maseca, but made from heirloom corn varieties, just like Masienda\u2019s fresh masa. As a just-add-water option, it\u2019s a historic boon to serious home taqueros and corn nerds.\n  At the same time, homegrown tortiller\u00edas around the country have been striving to make the best possible masa using American corn. Rather than relying on commodity dried field corn, enterprising tortiller\u00eda owners have been connecting with growers of varieties native to Northern California and the Midwest. It turns out that corn grown according to American organic standards makes pretty great masa too.\n  In Portland, Oregon, Adriana Azc\u00e1rate-Ferbel and her husband, Pedro Ferbel-Azc\u00e1rate, founded  Three Sisters Nixtamal in 2012, after getting tired of bringing back suitcases full of enchiladas Potosinas from Azc\u00e1rate-Ferbel\u2019s family\u2019s home in Mexico\u2019s state of San Luis Potosi. Azc\u00e1rate-Ferbel committed to the painstaking process of showing local food lovers why they should care about the tortillas they used for their Tuesday taco nights. The couple showed up every week at Portland\u2019s famous Saturday Farmers Market and free-sampled their way to a loyal customer base. Market goers were especially drawn to an eye-catching stack of marbled tortillas. The tortillas are made from a unique formula that Three Sisters Nixtamal created by carefully layering yellow, white, and blue corn masa batches with its red masa made with dried red chiles.\n \u201cWhen we first started, you couldn\u2019t even find American corn to nixtamalize!\u201d Azc\u00e1rate-Ferbel tells me in Espa\u00f1ol about her tortiller\u00eda\u2019s long journey. They wanted to get their corn as locally as possible, she says, but all the corn grown nearby in California and Washington was either a sweet corn variety or lower quality corn for animal feed. \u201cThe only organic corn that farmers were growing back then was used to feed their animals. It was hard at first.\u201d Azc\u00e1rate-Ferbel remembers vividly when she saw her first sack of Masienda corn in 2015. She was mesmerized by the sheer existence of heirloom Mexican corn in the States. \u201cBut it was $5 a pound just to buy the corn,\u201d she continues, \u201cand by the time you added labor and equipment cost to nixtamalize, we couldn\u2019t afford it.\u201d So they went their own way with American-grown field corn from Northern California, which was the most local the couple could find back then. In 2021, they are still committed to masa education, and you can still find their stand\u2019s vendors slicing masa to make freshly puffed tortillas for curious passersby to try at the farmers market. Their tortillas are now in many co-ops and supermarkets along the Pacific Northwest too.\n In Austin, Texas, Ferm\u00edn Nu\u00f1ez of  Suerte has made his own contribution to the country\u2019s tortilla renaissance in the form of outrageously delicious tacos on tortillas made from local corn. \u201cSuerte came about after being obsessed with making tacos out of central Texan corn,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez says. His obsession began with a serendipitous blob of masa that his future business partner, Sam Hellman-Mass, nixtamalized from Texas corn. \u201cBy luck, a well-known farmer here in Austin gave Sam some of his quality corn grown the right way that he usually fed his pigs with, and we opened Suerte, chasing that perfect tortilla since then.\u201d\n  Nu\u00f1ez and Hellman-Mass fought the uphill battle against Austin\u2019s Tex-Mex expectations, and through each plate of constantly revolving antojitos, like his perfect triangular tetelas filled with braised greens, he\u2019s taught many the joy of great masa in a region more partial to thick  flour tortillas and crunchy \u201chard shells.\u201d The accolades came pouring in. In 2019,  Food &amp; Wine placed it at number two on its  Best New Restaurant list. Waves of new articles and public attention followed shortly after. With growing demand and no other nixtamal of that quality in town, Nu\u00f1ez and Hellman-Mass effectively created a new corn market in Texas, and they are now stretching the limits of what the local supply can allow. \u201cThe corn growing season in Texas is crazy,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez continues. \u201cYou can only plant and harvest corn in Texas in March, so that means that you gotta commit to and predict how much corn the restaurant will go through the following year.\u201d\n  Nu\u00f1ez, who was born in northeast Mexico, believes that it\u2019s all about respecting the region where your Mexican restaurant is located. \u201cIf we were in Mexico, we would probably use corn from Mexico, but we\u2019re not\u2014we\u2019re in Austin.\u201d\n   For the longest time, public demand and market competition has pushed taqueros and taqueras in the U.S. to use the least expensive tortillas possible. This led to the almighty institution of $2 tacos that has dominated taquer\u00edas for the past 20 years. Organic tortillas can cost up to five times that of tortillas made from Maseca, and that figure only rises for handmade tortillas at restaurants. The result is a double standard that venerates the idea of a well-made taco, but also prevents the taquero from using better ingredients and selling tacos at a livable price. Something weird happens when you place a tortilla under beautiful ingredients. Before it was a \u201csmall plate.\u201d Now it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d a taco. In a market where customers don\u2019t think twice about paying $6 for a cup of coffee or $25 for a bowl of pasta, why are they unwilling to spend a few more dollars for a taco made with especially flavorful heirloom corn?\n  The high price of good masa has a lot to do with the physical heaviness of dried corn, and the fact that it grows best in the southern parts of Mexico. Transporting small-but-weighty batches of corn across the country costs money. But besides making for better tortillas, buying from heirloom corn farmers brings crucial support to traditional foodways surrounding one of the world\u2019s first domesticated crops. More important, it also supports the hardworking farming families who have saved those seeds for generations and helps them continue to grow rare, flavorful varieties for all your taco-nerding needs.\n At the same time, low-income Mexican people in Mexico and the U.S. shouldn\u2019t be priced out of their own culinary heritage. A true masa revolution needs to account for the inequalities and exploitation that exist in the supply chain, and it must protect those communities in relation to the growing demand for heirloom corn.\n \u201cMaking organic nixtamal using organic corn was our way of giving the middle finger to an industry that took so much of our cultural existence,\u201d Ricardo \u201cRick\u201d Ortega says. He is the cofounder of L.A.\u2019s first organic tortiller\u00eda,  Kernel of Truth Organics. Ortega and his founding business partner, Omar Ahmed, started his revolutionary tortiller\u00eda in 2014 as a stand against the city\u2019s gentrification, which threatens to erase their hometown\u2019s Mexican heritage. Ahmed is a second-generation tortillero. After his family\u2019s longstanding tortilla shop was gentrified out of Echo Park, an L.A. neighborhood that was a hotbed for gang violence in the \u201990s but is now one of L.A.\u2019s most expensive, Ortega and Ahmed pooled their savings to launch the brand, nixtamalizing on other shops\u2019 equipment in off-hours.\n The pandemic nearly forced Kernel of Truth Organics to shut down its tortilla-making permanently, but it barely ground by. Despite an urgent need for capital, Ortega and Ahmed refuse to sell tortillas to retail locations that mark up their products. \u201cI think about my mom and our abuelas,\u201d Ortega says. He admits that he still catches his parents with Guerrero tortillas\u2014a national mass-market brand\u2014in their refrigerator, but he is not giving up. This parental tortilla treason encapsulates the challenge posed by organic and heirloom corn tortillas: \u201cHow can we make these organic tortillas affordable enough for our parents and se\u00f1oras?\u201d Ortega asks.\n  As Ortega says, tortiller\u00edas like his are fighting the long fight. \u201cThe good fight,\u201d as he calls it. \u201cTo keep true tortillas close to our hearts and to keep masa in our hands.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:28:03", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6765\u5230,age,\u7389\u7c73\u997c", "title":

", "note_en": "In 2006, Redfin was the first company to put homes on a map\u2070. This was even before Google Maps was a performant platform. They launched with Microsoft Virtual Earth before migrating to Google Maps in 2008\u00b9. This was a legendary achievement in proptech, massively empowering homebuyers to shop on their own. Ever since, high quality map browsing has been table stakes for any real estate shopping tool.\n Going into Q2, the maps on Opendoor were having performance issues. When a user viewed  homes in Phoenix, it could take 15+ seconds before they see anything on the map.\n  Before we could start optimizing map speed, we needed to figure out why it felt slow. After some profiling with Chrome dev tools, it became apparent that there was a slow call to our REST API to fetch the property listing data to display on the map. Looking further, Datadog showed us that the bulk of this time was spent in ActiveModelSerializers and fetching from the DB. We then constructed a metric that captured the user pain we wanted to address: p90 time to fetch property data for the map. We use a 90th percentile to capture the predominant user experience while excluding outliers.\n   The 10.54s p90 to &lt;1s p90 optimization happened in 5 parts over about 1 month:\n   We use Rails  active_model_serializers to describe the fields that the REST API will return. A common problem in Rails apps is the same serializer being used for multiple endpoints and bloating to contain fields needed for multiple use-cases. This causes over-fetching of data both from our APIs and from the backing DB (we store listings in MongoDB). We also updated our  Mongoid queries to use  projections to return only the data necessary to fulfill the request from MongoDB. Creating specialized serializers just for the map component and reducing data fetches solved these issues and got us nearly a 2x speedup.\n A common problem in Rails apps is the same serializer being used for multiple endpoints and bloating to contain fields needed for multiple use-cases.\n   While fixing the DB problem, we noticed that we had smart logic in place to cache the serialized list of properties when the front-end requested an unfiltered list of properties for a region. This is the most common type of query because it\u2019s the default state when a user lands on a map. Unfortunately a bug had been introduced that turned off this caching behavior in all cases. We corrected this behavior and added integration tests around the endpoint to ensure the cache is populated, then hit on subsequent requests. Alerts on latency spikes and cache hit rate will catch and flag us to investigate caching system failures in prod (more on that below).\n  Datadog showed a lot of bouncing around between our serializers and mongo. It turned out that one of the fields had added an n+1 query by doing a fetch in one of the serializer fields as it was serializing a list of properties. We did this by using  Mongoid\u2019s includes() when querying for properties from the database. Optimizing queries so that all data was fetched in bulk before anything was serialized won us a few more seconds.\n  Both the properties on the map and the properties in the list were fetched by the same query. This was a design decision made to keep the logic simple and minimize the payload size if a property appears in both the list and the map. Profiling revealed that payload size wasn\u2019t really an issue, but each list required its own CloudSearch and database query. Splitting these into two separate API calls done in parallel from the front-end was an easy win and didn\u2019t require any encounters with multi-threading in Rails.\n  Our final win came from avoiding the database entirely on some requests. Normally we fetch property listings from CloudSearch then hydrate them with a few extra fields from MongoDB. Instead, we switched the front-end to only expect latitude/longitude point locations and display clusters if there are more than 120 properties to show. This means that when point clusters are showing we don\u2019t have to touch MongoDB, and in the cases we do, it\u2019s a small number of properties and relatively quick.\n  The final step was ensuring we have a great way to catch regressions. While automated tests are useful to catch bugs at the code level, alerting is important because subtle config changes can break distributed systems (like the cache) in ways automated testing in a staging environment may not catch. We now get notified by Datadog when there\u2019s an anomalous latency change and we have useful dashboards with associated metrics.\n    As a result, we\u2019re seeing great performance from our home shopping tools and have seen even faster adoption of  Opendoor-Backed Offers, an offering that backs our buyers\u2019 home offers with all cash to give them a competitive edge in today\u2019s hot market. Performance work on web and mobile is a top priority for me and my team.

", "note_en": "Patrick Doherty had always been very active. He trekked the Himalayas and hiked trails in Spain.\n  But about a year and a half ago, he noticed pins and needles in his fingers and toes. His feet got cold. And then he started getting out of breath any time he walked his dog up the hills of County Donegal in Ireland where he lives.\n  &#34;I noticed on some of the larger hill climbs I was getting a bit breathless,&#34; says Doherty, 65. &#34;So I realized something was wrong.&#34;\n  Doherty found out he had a rare, but devastating inherited disease \u2014 known as  transthyretin amyloidosis \u2014 that had killed his father. A misshapen protein was building up in his body, destroying important tissues, such as nerves in his hands and feet and his heart.\n    &#34;It&#39;s terrible prognosis,&#34; Doherty says. &#34;This is a condition that deteriorates very rapidly. It&#39;s just dreadful.&#34;\n  So Doherty was thrilled when he found out that doctors were testing a new way to try to treat amyloidosis. The approach used a revolutionary gene-editing technique called  CRISPR, which allows scientists to make very precise changes in DNA.\n      On Saturday, researchers reported the first data indicating that the experimental treatment worked, causing levels of the destructive protein to plummet in Doherty&#39;s body and the bodies of five other patients treated with the approach.\n    The advance is being hailed not just for amyloidosis patients but also as a proof-of-concept that CRISPR could be used to treat many other, much more common diseases. It&#39;s a new way of using the innovative technology.\n  &#34;This is a major milestone for patients,&#34; says  Jennifer Doudna of the University of California, Berkeley, who shared a Nobel Prize for her work helping develop CRISPR.\n  &#34;While these are early data, they show us that we can overcome one of the biggest challenges with applying CRISPR clinically so far, which is being able to deliver it systemically and get it to the right place,&#34; Doudna says.\n  CRISPR has already been shown to help patients suffering from the devastating blood disorders  sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. And doctors are trying to use it to treat cancer and to  restore vision to people blinded by a rare genetic disorder.\n  But those experiments involve taking cells out of the body, editing them in the lab, and infusing them back in or injecting CRISPR directly into cells that need fixing.\n    The study Doherty volunteered for is the first in which doctors are simply infusing the gene-editor directly into patients and letting it find its own way to the right gene in the right cells. In this case, it&#39;s cells in the liver making the destructive protein.\n  &#34;This is the first example in which CRISPR-Cas9 is injected directly into the bloodstream \u2014 in other words systemic administration \u2014 where we use it as a way to reach a tissue that&#39;s far away from the site of injection and very specifically use it to edit disease-causing genes,&#34; says John Leonard, the CEO of  Intellia Therapeutics, which is sponsoring the study.\n  Doctors infused billions of microscopic structures known as nanoparticles carrying genetic instructions for the CRISPR gene-editor into four patients in London and two in New Zealand. The nanoparticles were absorbed by their livers, where they unleashed armies of CRISPR gene-editors. The CRISPR editor homed in on the target gene in the liver  and sliced it, disabling production of the destructive protein.\n  Within weeks, the levels of protein causing the disease plummeted, especially in the volunteers who received a higher dose. Researchers reported at the  Peripheral Nerve Society Annual Meeting and in a  paper published in  The New England Journal of Medicine.\n  &#34;It really is exciting,&#34; says Dr.  Julian Gillmore, who is leading the study at the University College London, Royal Free Hospital.\n  &#34;This has the potential to completely revolutionize the outcome for these patients who have lived with this disease in their family for many generations. It&#39;s decimated some families that I&#39;ve been looking after. So this is amazing,&#34; Gillmore says.\n  The patients will have to be followed longer, and more patients will have to be treated, to make sure the treatment&#39;s safe, and determine how much it&#39;s helping, Gillmore stresses. But the approach could help those struck by amyloidosis that isn&#39;t inherited, which is a far more common version of the disease, he says.\n  Moreover, the promising results potentially open the door for using the same approach to treatment of many other, more common diseases for which taking cells out of the body or directly injecting CRISPR isn&#39;t realistic, including heart disease, muscular dystrophy and brain diseases such as Alzheimer&#39;s.\n  &#34;This is really opening a new era as we think about gene-editing where we can begin to think about accessing all kinds of different tissue in the body via systemic administration,&#34; Leonard says.\n    &#34;This is a wonderful day for the future of gene-editing as a medicine,&#34;  agree  Fyodor Urnov, a professor of genetics at the University of California, Berkeley. &#34;We as a species are watching this remarkable new show called: our gene-edited future.&#34;\n  Doherty says he started feeling better within weeks of the treatment and has continued to improve in the weeks since then.\n  &#34;I definitely feel better,&#34; he told NPR. &#34;I&#39;m speaking to you from upstairs in our house. I climbed stairs to get up here. I would have been feeling breathless. I&#39;m thrilled.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:27:25", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u57fa\u56e0,gene,crispr", "title":

", "note_en": "Adventures with Van Gogh is a weekly blog by Martin Bailey, our long-standing correspondent and expert on the artist. Published every Friday, his stories will range from newsy items about this most intriguing artist to scholarly pieces based on his own meticulous investigations and discoveries.\n  Reproduced here for the first time: a trio of sketches from Vincent\u2019s village\u2014designed as a bookmark\n One of Van Gogh\u2019s most unusual artworks has just emerged\u2014three unknown sketches of peasants. They are drawn on a thin vertical strip of paper, a curious format for an artist to choose. The drawings were found in a novel on the French peasantry and the paper is exactly the same height as the book.\n The three sketches are reproduced by  The Art Newspaper here for the first time. Discoveries of totally unknown Van Gogh drawings are now rare\u2014perhaps once or twice in a decade. The sheet has just gone on display at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, in a new exhibition on acquisitions,   Here to Stay (until 12 September). Although it is presented in the show as simply a trio of sketches, the artwork almost certainly served an unexpected purpose.\n    Teio Meedendorp, a senior researcher at the Amsterdam museum, told us: \u201cI believe that it was made as a bookmark. It would be curious to draw three sketches in this configuration unless there was a reason, and it fits snugly inside the book in which it was found.\u201d\n    Vincent, an avid reader, gave his copy of a novel on the French peasantry to his Dutch artist friend Anthon van Rappard. Writing to Van Rappard on 15 June 1883, he said he would be posting a package to him in Utrecht, with prints and a book by the French writers Emile Erckmann and Alexandre Chatrian, whom he greatly admired.  Histoire d\u2019un Paysan recounts the story of the French Revolution through the eyes of an Alsace peasant. Illustrated by Th\u00e9ophile Schuler, Vincent assured his friend that \u201cI do think you\u2019ll find the Erckmann-Chatrian beautiful\u201d.\n    Van Rappard died in 1892, aged just 33, and the book then passed to his wife Henri\u00ebtte, who lived until 1910.  Histoire d\u2019un Paysan, together with the bookmark, was quietly preserved by her family until 2019, when both were privately sold to the Van Gogh Museum.\n The pencil drawings are crude, since they were done soon after Vincent set out to become an artist, but they are important since so few of his early informal sketches survive. Stylistically, they can be dated to autumn 1881, when he was living in his parent\u2019s village of Etten and was deeply interested in capturing figures of the local peasants at work.\n It was not until two years later that Vincent sent  Histoire d\u2019un Paysan to Van Rappard, suggesting that the bookmark had lain forgotten in the novel and was not noticed when he wrapped up the package. If Vincent had set out to give Van Rappard a few sketches, he would have been much more likely to have sent very recent ones, to demonstrate how his art was developing.\n On the 28cm-high bookmark, the upper sketch shows a woman walking by a pollarded tree. The middle one portrays a seated man beside a fire, a work reminiscent of a finished drawing which Van Gogh made in November 1881,   Old Man at the Fireside  (now Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum, Otterlo). The lower sketch depicts a woman in profile. Van Gogh may well have seen the figures as loosely illustrating the Erckmann-Chatrian novel.\n    The front of the book is signed \u201cVincent\u201d. He had sent the book to Van Rappard \u201cto read\u201d and it is unclear whether the signature indicates that it was a gift or was a polite reminder that it was a loan and should be returned.\n    In October, just over year after sending the book, Van Rappard visited Vincent in Nuenen\u2014but without returning the book. During the visit Van Gogh sketched a portrait of his friend, the largest drawn portrait in his entire oeuvre. Only the top half of the work survives.\n Sadly, their friendship came to an abrupt end in May 1885, after Van Rappard wrote critically about Vincent\u2019s only  lithograph, which depicted his painting of  The Potato Eaters. Vincent, who was furious, dismembered the portrait, neatly slicing it in half. The bottom half has been lost, but he soon reused the reverse of the top half to make rough sketches of a pair of women and a man carrying a bundle of wood.\n Thanks to this recycling, the most important half of the Van Rappard portrait, with the eyes, has been saved\u2014poignant evidence of Van Gogh\u2019s closest friendship during his Dutch artistic years.\n  \u2022 Christie\u2019s is to sell a drawing of   The Potato Harvester (Aardappelrooier)  in London on 30 June, estimated at \u00a3300,000-\u00a3500,000. Dating from June-July 1885, it was done in Nuenen, the village in the south of the Netherlands. Fork in hand, the peasant is digging up potatoes, while smoking his pipe.  The Potato Harvester was originally owned by the distinguished Dutch art historian H.P. Bremmer.\n    \u2022 The  Sunflowers (August 1888) is back in London this week, after being the star attraction for a tour of the National Gallery\u2019s paintings to Japan and Australia. At the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra the exhibition of 61 works was seen by 201,000 people during its 15-week run. With Covid-19, this is likely to rank among the world\u2019s best-attended 2020-21 exhibitions.\n    Martin Bailey is a leading Van Gogh specialist and investigative reporter for  The Art Newspaper.

", "note_en": "Those of us who learned arithmetic using pen and paper, working with the ten digits 0\u20139 and place value, may take for granted that this is the way it\u2019s always been done, or at least the way it ought to be done. But if you think of the amount of time and energy spent in the early school years just to teach place value, you\u2019ll realize that this sort of numeracy is not preordained.\n  Over the past 5,500 years, more than 100 distinct ways of writing numbers have been developed and used by numerate societies, linguistic anthropologist Stephen Chrisomalis has found. Thousands more ways of speaking numbers, manipulating physical objects, and using human bodies to enumerate are known to exist, or to have existed, he writes in his new book \u201c Reckonings: Numerals, Cognition, and History.\u201d Remarkably, each of the basic structures was invented multiple times independently of one another. In \u201cReckonings,\u201d Chrisomalis considers how humans past and present have used numerals, reinterpreting historical and archaeological representations of numerical notation and exploring the implications of why we write numbers with figures rather than words. Drawing on, and expanding upon, the enormous cross-cultural and comparative literatures in linguistics, cognitive anthropology, and the history of science that bear on questions of numeracy, he shows that numeracy is a social practice.\n Chrisomalis took time out from a busy end to the spring semester to field a few questions about his new book, his spirited defense of Roman numerals, his complicated relationships with mathematicians, and his thoughts on the validity of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis.\n  Philip Laughlin: We\u2019ve worked with a number of linguists and anthropologists over the years but you are our first author to specialize in written numerical systems. What sparked your interest in this topic? Why are numerals an important area of research?\n Stephen Chrisomalis: I first became interested in numerals when I wrote a paper in an undergraduate cognitive anthropology course in the mid-1990s. After moving away from the subject for a couple years, I came back to it when I was looking for a PhD topic along with my advisor, the late Bruce Trigger at McGill. This resulted in my dissertation, which later became my first book, \u201c Numerical Notation: A Comparative History\u201d (Cambridge, 2010). It was an unorthodox project for an anthropology department \u2014 neither strictly archaeological nor ethnohistorical nor ethnographic. But that was exactly the sort of creative project that it was possible to do at McGill at that time, and that sadly, given the exigencies of the modern job market, is almost impossible to imagine doing today.\n  What brought me to numerical notation as a dissertation subject is much of what still appeals to me about it now. We have evidence from over 100 different systems used across every inhabited continent over 5,000 years, including all the world\u2019s literate traditions. Numbers are a ubiquitous domain of human existence, and written numerals are virtually everywhere that there is writing. While, of course, the historical and archaeological records are partial (which is in turn both exciting and frustrating), understanding their history and cross-cultural transmission is a tractable problem. We can tell, roughly, when and where they originate and how they relate to one another.\n Also, every user of a numerical notation system is also a speaker of one or more languages, which lets us ask great questions comparing number words to numerical notation and to show how they interact. These questions can be as simple as \u201cDo people say \u2018two thousand twenty one\u2019 or \u2018twenty twenty one\u2019?\u201d and as big as \u201cWere numbers first visual marks or spoken words?\u201d As a linguist and an anthropologist, that\u2019s very attractive. Because there is a significant and large literature on numerical cognition, the comparative, historical data I bring to the table is useful for testing and expanding on our knowledge in that interdisciplinary area.\n PL: You had the cover image and title for this book in your head for years. Can you explain the significance of the watch and why you chose the title \u201cReckonings\u201d in the first place? What were you trying to get across to potential readers with that evocative word?\n  SC: The title \u2018Reckonings\u2019 invokes the triple meaning of the word \u2018reckon\u2019 \u2014 to calculate, to think, and to judge \u2014 which parallels the three parts of the subtitle: \u201cNumerals, Cognition, and History.\u201d Reckoning is not mathematics, in its technical, disciplinary sense, but it reflects the everyday practices of working with and manipulating numbers. Then, in English and in other languages, we extend the verb for calculation to thinking in general \u2014 to reckon thus involves the more general cognitive questions I hope I\u2019ve addressed. Finally, we come to reckoning as judgement \u2014 every numerical notation faces its own reckoning as users decide whether to adopt, transmit, and eventually, abandon it. As I spend a lot of time talking about the obsolescence of numeral systems, most notably but not limited to the Roman numerals, I wanted to echo this decision-making process of judgement by which users decide to abandon one notation in favor of another. \u201cReckonings\u201d signals that the book might be about arithmetic \u2014 but it\u2019s about a lot more than that.\n  The cover image of the book is a watch designed by the French watchmaker Jean-Antoine L\u00e9pine in 1788, now held at the British Museum (BM 1958,1201.289). L\u00e9pine was one of the first horologists to consistently use Western (commonly called Arabic) numerals instead of Roman numerals for hour markers, but in the 1780s he made a number of watches like this one, where he instead playfully mixed the two systems. The hybridity on this sort of artifact is visually striking and memorable to the viewer, both then and now. But actually, it isn\u2019t as weird as it seems; we combine numerical representations all the time, like when we write something like \u201c1.2 million\u201d instead of \u201c1,200,000.\u201d Unlike the Roman numerals alone, which would be visually \u2018unbalanced\u2019 on a watch, this hybrid system expresses every number from 1 through 12 in no more than two digits. To me it embodies the passage of time in material form and the replacement of the Roman numerals. By the 1780s, they had been replaced for most purposes, but watch and clock faces are one of the places where, even today, they\u2019re pretty common. As a sort of metonym for this historical process, the L\u00e9pine watch highlights that the decline and fall of the Roman numerals was not a slow, steady, predictable replacement, but one with many disjunctures.\n PL: At the book launch, you talked a bit about the future of number systems, but with the caveat that you are not a \u201cFuturologist.\u201d So I\u2019ll ask you to put on a historian\u2019s hat instead: What kind of cultural changes are necessary for a society to switch from one number system to another? It seems to me that significant changes would have to happen at least at the political and economic level for one numerical system to supersede another, right?\n SC: One of the key arguments in \u201cReckonings\u201d is that numerical notations don\u2019t get replaced in orderly, \u2018survival of the fittest\u2019 processes. To argue that simply raises the question: fittest for what purpose? Numerical notations are principally used for representation and communication, not computation, so it\u2019s the context of writing and reading practices, rather than changes in mathematics, that motivate their history. The last time that happened was with the advent of the printing press and the rise of a more general literacy among white middle-class Europeans in the 15 th and 16 th centuries alongside mercantile capitalism \u2014 and not coincidentally, that was exactly when, where, and by whom the Roman numerals were substantially abandoned. Strikingly, this was not accompanied with a lot of fanfare or explicit comparison of the two systems. The Western numerals had been around in Europe for 500 years, and then, once conditions were right, they rapidly supplanted Roman numerals so that some commentators could even see the change within a lifetime.\n  Just in general, though, we should be very hesitant to assume that we are at the \u2018end of history\u2019 of anything, whether that\u2019s a number system or a political system. Nothing lasts forever \u2013 we may simply lack the imagination to think of how and when it could be replaced. I\u2019m confident that your average Roman or Egyptian or Aztec merchant or engineer couldn\u2019t have imagined the Western numerals. In the same way, I think we\u2019re subject to the same sort of cognitive closure \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine from our vantage point what could ever change to lead to the abandonment of a universal notation. While I don\u2019t see it happening soon, the sorts of massive technological changes of the past 50 years, extended for another century or two, could be such a catalyst. But alone, technology isn\u2019t deterministic \u2014 only in conjunction with changes in social, economic, and communicative practices would that be likely. And even then, there\u2019s no guarantee. Not only would such a system need to be invented, but some community of users would need to perceive it as being sufficiently better, for some purpose, to warrant abandoning what is, at this point, a universal notation. One of the costs of doing so is that, because numerical systems are for communicating, using a rare system means you aren\u2019t able to communicate with as many people as with a common one. That isn\u2019t necessarily fatal to a notation\u2019s survival, but it is an obstacle to be overcome.\n PL: I\u2019m curious to know how mathematicians have responded to your work. How do they feel about the historical perspective you bring to number systems and arithmetic, and does it have any bearing on their own work?\n SC: Well, I sometimes joke with my friends and collaborators who are mathematicians that mathematics is the branch of anthropology that focuses on numbers! Seriously, though, mathematics and anthropology seem to stand on the opposite ends of a spectrum about the degree to which the phenomena they study are fundamentally human. Mathematicians are mostly Platonists \u2014 or really, more strictly, mathematical realists \u2014 they argue very persuasively that abstract mathematical objects like numbers are in some sense real independent of our observation of them. Some of this sense is intuitive \u2014 anyone who has done mathematics has experienced this sensation of real discovery, even when \u2018discovering\u2019 something that had been known for centuries. But some of it is based on the quite proper insight that even very weird mathematical entities, like \u03c0, are not subject to cultural whim. In contrast, anthropologists tend to see most things as culturally constructed and subject to variation \u2014 a human product of specific social contexts. These are caricatures, but there\u2019s some truth to them. Anthropologists tend not to spend a lot of time on things where the human element is irrelevant.\n In the late 1940s and early 1950s this led to a debate between the Platonist mathematician and popularizer Martin Gardner and the materialist evolutionary anthropologist Leslie White. The former treats variation in the form of notation as nothing more than differences in representing a deep, underlying reality, the latter sees the construction of mathematical objects by human minds as prior to the invention of formal mathematics. And because anthropologists (as a stereotype with some validity) don\u2019t often have much training in mathematics, it\u2019s easy to fall into this binary. But actually it doesn\u2019t need to be nearly so antagonistic. Most mathematicians freely grant that humans create notations, and that different notations make some ideas easy to see and others much harder. And even a brief look at the comparative history of mathematics and numeration shows that there is much more commonality among human arithmetic than there is difference. There simply is nowhere where 1+1=3. That\u2019s because the human mind is interacting with the real world to produce insights, and that\u2019s true even for mathematics where the objects of analysis are quite abstract.\n PL: You spend a lot of time debunking the idea that the Roman numerals are an inferior notation. Why so much energy on defending an archaic system? What do the Roman numerals tell us about number systems in general?\n SC: Of all the number systems still in use today, the only one most readers will be familiar that uses a different structure to the now nearly-universal Western numerals 0-9 are the Roman numerals. They may be archaic but we still use them for all sorts of secondary and prestige functions, like counting things we really value, such as kings, popes, and Super Bowls. (Although every year, the week before the Super Bowl, there is a news article complaining about them!) But they are still taught and learned in lots of schools. And actually, that\u2019s part of the problem, because along with the signs IVXLCDM and the rules for combining them, we are also taught an ideology that the Roman numerals were no good for math, and that was why they were discarded. That ideology is so pervasive that it has rarely been questioned.\n  It\u2019s not that I think the Roman numerals are the best system available; they just aren\u2019t nearly as awful as we\u2019ve been conditioned to believe. They not only survived but thrived, throughout large swaths of Europe, for 2,000 years. Unless we believe that pre-modern people were a bunch of dupes, they can\u2019t have been so bad. Even after the Western numerals 0-9 were introduced into Europe through Arabic and Indian ancestors, it took hundreds of years for the Roman numerals to be supplanted. This is not some sort of archaism that just happened to avoid being snuffed out. It was a core representational practice throughout most of Europe for almost any purpose you can imagine numbers being used for. The one thing they weren\u2019t really used for is what we now think of as pen-and-paper arithmetic \u2014 lining up numbers in columns. That\u2019s because in classical antiquity and indeed, until the past few hundred years, arithmetic was an embodied and material practice (e.g., on a counting board or abacus) whereas numerical notation was used for writing and recording. This division of labor is very common throughout the world\u2019s numerical notations, most of which were never manipulated directly for arithmetic.\n PL: Since you are an anthropology professor and I am a cognitive science editor at The MIT Press, I would be remiss if I did not ask you about Benjamin Lee Whorf\u2019s \u201c Language, Thought, and Reality.\u201d This is probably the first cognitive science book MIT Press ever published and it has remained in print for over 60 years now. In 2021, what do you make of that book in particular and the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis in general? Is it an idea that still retains power?\n SC:  \u201cLanguage, Thought, and Reality\u201d is almost certainly the most cited piece of linguistic anthropological writing ever, and still taught in hundreds of courses, including my own graduate seminar, where I regularly teach the chapter \u201cThe relation of habitual thought and behavior to language.\u201d It is also one of the most deeply misunderstood books across multiple fields. There really is no such thing as \u201cthe Sapir-Whorf hypothesis\u201d; rather, there are a set of ideas, some centuries old, about the effect that language has on thought. But everyone knows that language has some effect on thought \u2014 no reasonable person denies this. What Whorf, Sapir, and other linguistic relativists do is argue that variations in linguistic structure \u2014 patterns in syntax or morphology, or differences in how languages divide up the world \u2014 affect cognition. (Although I should note that neither Sapir nor Whorf used the term \u2018cognition\u2019 at all, because MIT Press was one of the first presses to define cognitive science as an independent subject of investigation!) What is the scope of these effects? Probably less than in some of the more programmatic statements by folks like Whorf, but significantly more than would have been assumed by linguists, say, 30 years ago when I first studied the discipline.\n Number and numeracy was one of the earliest domains of human social life studied under what we would now think of as the 19th-century ancestors of linguistic relativity \u2014 but largely in a now-rightly rejected way that saw systems of thought as part of ordered, evolutionary stages from simple to complex. I recently published  a paper on this very subject. In  LT&amp;R, Whorf argued that Newtonian physics was, in significant part, a product of the structuring influence of European languages in which Newton wrote, like Latin and English. That\u2019s a big claim and hard to justify empirically. But both number words and number notations are basically categories; they\u2019re ways of dividing up the world of quantity meaningfully, and humans do it in different ways. These notations constrain but do not determine how we solve numerical problems. A meme that floats around social media every few months asks people to describe how they solve the problem \u201c28 + 47.\u201d The answer is 75 \u2014 that\u2019s not relativistic. And there are a number of strategies for solving the problem. In a community where arithmetic is mediated through a device like an abacus, the strategies will be even more varied.

", "note_en": "On Thursday, July 13, 1995, a concentration of high pressure in the upper atmosphere above Midwest Chicago forced massive amounts of hot air to the ground, causing temperatures as high as 41\u00b0C (106\u00b0F). In a Midwestern city not built for tropical heat, roads buckled, cars broke down in the street, and schools closed their doors. On Friday, three Con Ed power transformers failed, leaving 49,000 people without electricity. In high-rise apartments with no air conditioning, temperatures hit 49\u00b0C (120\u00b0F) even with the windows open. The heat continued into Saturday. The human body can only take about 48 hours of uninterrupted heat like this before its defenses begin to shut down, and emergency rooms were so crowded they had to turn away heatstroke victims. Sunday was no better, and as the death toll rose\u2014of dehydration, heat exhaustion, and renal failure\u2014the morgues hit capacity, too, and bodies were stored in refrigerated meat-packing trucks. In all, 739 people died as a result of the heat wave.\n In its aftermath, an inquiry found, unsurprisingly, that the majority of those who died were poor, old, and lived alone. More surprising was the gender imbalance: significantly more men died than women. This was especially strange considering that in Chicago in July\u00a0of 1995, there were more old women who lived alone than old men.\n What made these men more vulnerable than the women? It wasn\u2019t physical circumstances. Both groups lived mostly in \u201csingle room occupancy\u201d buildings, or   SROs\u2014apartments of one room in what used to be called flophouses. It was social circumstances. The phrase \u201cNo known relatives\u201d appears repeatedly in police reports of the dead men\u2019s homes. Letters of regret were found on floors and in backs of drawers: \u201cI would like to see you if that\u2019s possible, when you come to the city\u201d; \u201cIt seems to me that our family should have gotten along.\u201d The single rooms of the deceased are described as \u201croach infested\u201d and \u201ca complete mess,\u201d indicating few or no visitors. The women, according to Eric Klinenberg,  who wrote a book on the heat wave, had people who checked up on them and so kept them alive; the men did not. \u201cWhen you have time please come visit me soon at my place,\u201d read another letter, unsent.\n   Artie, 63, who lives in Beards Fork, West Virginia, population 200, has never married. He grew up in Beards Fork, but spent most of his life elsewhere. He moved back when he was 47 to take care of his sick mother, who died earlier this year. Now, after putting his own life on hold for sixteen years, he finds himself single, semi-retired, and without a close friend. \u201cLife goes by really fast,\u201d he said. Since his mom died, he\u2019s found himself thinking, \u201cWhere in the hell did it go?\u201d\n This is the kind of thing he used to talk about with his mother. Now that she\u2019s gone, he doesn\u2019t really open up to anyone. He has no close friends in the area, and he\u2019s \u201cfelt a lot of depression over the past few years.\u201d\n Artie\u2019s not an antisocial guy or a homebody. His career brought him into contact with hundreds of interesting people over the years; he lived in California for a decade, and before that he had a nine-year relationship. But back in his hometown, all the connections he made seem to have melted away. \u201cI don\u2019t really have any close friends, other than my family,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is something different.\u201d (A 2005 Australian  study agreed: while close friendships increase your longevity by up to 22\u00a0percent, family relationships make no difference.)\n Artie has a group of friends he met in his thirties and forties with whom he\u2019s still in touch, mainly on Facebook, but those relationships are \u201cnot quite the same as the friendships I had when I was younger. Less deep. Less vulnerable. And I\u2019m not even sure I want to [open up].\u201d He\u2019s somewhat close with a few of his former coworkers, but though they confide in him, he doesn\u2019t feel like he can confide in them. \u201cThey\u2019re younger,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand my problems.\u201d Despite being semi-retired, he still goes into the office every day and stays late, after everyone\u2019s gone. \u201cI\u2019m reluctant to go home,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody\u2019s there.\u201d\n In many ways, Artie seems in danger of going down the path of those Chicago   SRO-dwellers. But there\u2019s an important difference between those men and Artie: what the former had in common was their  social isolation\u2014having few or no social connections. Artie\u2019s problem, on the other hand, is one of  loneliness\u2014the  feeling of being isolated, regardless of your social connectedness, usually due to having few or no confidants.\n  At first glance it seems unlikely. I\u2019m 34. I have what seems to me a pretty active social life. I\u2019m integrated into my community and I go to arts events regularly. I\u2019ve lived here in Toronto off and on since I was 18. I went to university here. I helped found an arts venue here. I know hundreds of people here, if not thousands. I have multiple jobs\u2014college instructor, freelance writer, tutor. I have friends. Whatever path led to these lonely destinations, I want to believe, is not the path I\u2019m on. When I die, my floor will be tidy, and my letters sent.\n And yet, there\u2019s something about their stories that seems eerily familiar. Slowly but surely, I feel my social world slipping away from me. All three of my jobs combined require me to be around other humans a total of about eight hours out of a week\u2019s 168. The other 160, I\u2019m mostly at home. It\u2019s not unusual for me to go several days in a row with no social contact of any kind, and the longer I go without it, the scarier it feels. I become shy, paranoid that no one would want to hang out with me. Social slights metastasize in my brain. I start to avoid social functions, convinced I\u2019ll walk into a wall of mysterious eye contact. I live close to many friends, but I hide from them when I see them in the street. I don\u2019t think of myself as antisocial\u2014I love people, love being around them, and have had so many good friendships\u2014but it often feels like an uphill battle, and mystifyingly complex, to not slip back endlessly into this pit of despair.\n The thing is, I wasn\u2019t always like this. How did I get here?\n  Friendship in adulthood is a challenge for a lot of people. On average,  both m en and women start to lose friends around age 25, and  continue to lose friends steadily for the rest of our lives. As adults, we tend to work more, commit to more serious romantic relationships, and start families, all of which end up taking priority over buddy time. Even if, like me, at age 34, you don\u2019t have full-time work, you\u2019re not in a relationship, and you\u2019re nowhere close to starting your own family, others\u2019 adulting leaves you bereft.\n Furthermore, young adults  move around the country more than any other demographic, which severs our support networks\u2014a phenomenon Robert Putnam calls the \u201cre-potting\u201d effect, referring to the injury a transplanted plant sustains losing its roots.  People are changing jobs more than ever, which interrupts connections that in previous eras would have become decades long. And freelancing, which  Forbes estimates  50\u00a0percent\u00a0of the   U.S. workforce will be doing in one way or another by 2020, deprives the worker of not only job security, but social stability. As a freelancer who\u2019s had six different jobs in the past year alone and who lived in a dozen countries throughout my twenties, I fall squarely into the most vulnerable part of this Venn diagram. I try to compensate by keeping up with, like, four or five different friend-groups on social media\u2014mostly Facebook, where I have 3,691 contacts\u2014but I often find myself using social media more like a performance art video game than a way to facilitate friendships. And studies show that I\u2019m closer to the norm than the exception. \u201cOnline social contacts with friends and family,\u201d as  one study put it, \u201cwere not an effective alternative for offline social interactions in reducing feelings of loneliness.\u201d\n And that\u2019s what I am, I guess. Lonely. Sometimes excruciatingly so. Loneliness can be measured by psychometry like the    UCLA Loneliness Scale (I scored 21 out of 40) or the  De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (I am high on emotional loneliness, low on social loneliness). For me, though, loneliness at its core is a stubborn, irrational certainty that no matter how well I know the people in my life\u2014several of whom I consider close, some of whom I\u2019ve known for decades\u2014I am not, as the poem goes, involved in mankind. I still feel, in the bad moments, frantic with isolation, and become my 16-year-old self, desperate on the edge of my parents\u2019 bathtub, mentally searching for a friend, having ruled out all the obvious candidates. I tried to summon a world in which Blake MacPhail, whose sister\u2019s apartment I visited once two years earlier, could be considered my friend. That wasn\u2019t the loneliest I ever felt, but it set the template, and I still feel that way more often than perhaps those who know me would suspect. Or maybe they would suspect it; maybe they feel it too; over the past few decades, as the structure of society has changed, loneliness has increased, and now affects  almost half the population. Just last week, the American Psychological Association issued a  press release advising that \u201cmany nations around the world now suggest we are facing a \u2018loneliness epidemic.\u2019\u201d\n And as if  feeling lonely wasn\u2019t bad enough, it also turns out that loneliness and isolation are shockingly bad for your health and wellbeing. The quality of your friendships is the largest predictor of your  happiness. Social isolation weakens your immune system, raises your blood pressure, messes with your sleep, and  can be as bad for you as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. According to the authors of  a widely cited meta-analysis, loneliness on its own can increase your chances of an early death by 30\u00a0percent\u00a0and \u201cheightened risk for mortality from a lack of social relationships is greater than that from obesity.\u201d And in practical terms, being in contact with nobody in an emergency, like the men in the Chicago heat wave, can kill you in an instant.\n Unfortunately for me, like the majority of those Chicago dead, I belong to another, perhaps counterintuitive, at-risk category: I\u2019m a man. All that freelancing and moving and adulthood stuff affects men and women alike, but, for a complex set of reasons, men face additional roadblocks to connection. On average, we have  fewer confidants\u00a0and\u00a0are  more socially isolated.\u00a0Women  do report being lonelier than men, and research says, statistically, they are\u2014if they\u2019re married and between the ages of 20 and 49. For all other demographics, though,\u00a0 men are in fact lonelier than women. On top of all that, there\u2019s a   consensus among  researchers   that due to male reluctance to self-identify as having emotional problems, the ubiquity of men\u2019s loneliness is probably being underestimated.\n  I have a photograph of my friend Tyler and myself\u00a0snuggling on my parents\u2019 cream carpet, in the sun, next to my sandy dog. It\u2019s a sweet moment, but captures something bitter, too: this was probably the last time I touched a male friend in a way that wasn\u2019t a handshake or a bro-y hug. We were, like, six.\n One avenue into understanding men\u2019s loneliness is to consider how children are socialized. In an interview, Niobe Way, a professor of developmental psychology at New York University who has been doing research with adolescent boys for almost three decades, talked about how we are failing boys. \u201cThe social and emotional skills necessary for boys to thrive are just not being fostered,\u201d she said in an interview. Indeed, when you look at the research, men do not start life as the stereotypes we become. Six-month-old boys  are likely to \u201ccry more than girls,\u201d more likely to express joy at the sight of our mother\u2019s faces, and more likely to match our expressions to theirs. In general, before the age of four or five, research shows that  boys are more emotive than girls.\n The change begins around the time we start school: at that age\u2014about five\u2014boys become  worse than girls at \u201cchanging our facial expressions to foster social relationships.\u201d This is the beginning of a socialization process in \u201ca culture that supports emotional development for girls and discourages it for boys,\u201d according to  Dan Kindlon and Michael Thompson. This begins to affect our friendships early\u2014in a study in New Haven, Connecticut, boys aged 10-18 were  significantly worse than girls at knowing who their friends  were : \u201cover a two-week period, the boys changed their nomination of who their best friend was more frequently than girls, and their nomination was less likely to be reciprocated.\u201d\n Still, there\u2019ll never be better soil than school in which to grow friendships, and most boys do find good friends as children. Way, who summarized her findings in her book  Deep Secrets, found that, up until early adolescence, boys are not shy about how much they love their friends. Way quotes one boy named Justin in his first year of high school: \u201c[My best friend and I] love each other\u2026 That\u2019s it\u2026 you have this thing that is deep, so deep, it\u2019s within you, you can\u2019t explain it. \u2026 I guess in life, sometimes two people can really, really understand each other and really have a trust, respect, and love for each other.\u201d Another high school freshman, Jason, told Way friendships were important because then \u201cyou are not lonely \u2026 you need someone to turn to when things are bad.\u201d\n However, for many boys\u2014Way calls it \u201cnear-universal\u201d\u2014a shift occurs in late adolescence,\u00a0roughly from the ages of 15-20. In a phase of life we often think of in optimistic terms\u2014self-discovery, coming of age\u2014boys\u2019 trust in each other shatters like glass. Three years after his first interview, Jason, asked if he had any close friends, said no, \u201cand immediately adds that while he has nothing against gay people, he himself is not gay.\u201d Another boy interviewed by Way in the eleventh grade who up until the year before had maintained a best friendship for ten years said he now had no friends because \u201cyou can\u2019t trust nobody these days.\u201d In interviews with thousands of boys, Way saw a tight correlation between confiding in close friends and mental health, and she observed that, across all ethnic groups and income brackets, three quarters of the boys she spoke to \u201cgrow fearful of betrayal by and distrustful of their male peers\u201d in late adolescence, and \u201cbegin to speak increasingly of feeling lonely and depressed.\u201d\n Making matters worse, in the middle of this estrangement from other boys, as we\u2019re becoming young men, we\u2019re governed more than ever by a new set of rules about what behaviour we\u2019re allowed to show. Psychologists call them display rules. \u201cExpressions of hurt and worry and of care and concern for others,\u201d  according to white high schools boys, are \u201cgay\u201d or \u201cgirly.\u201d Black and Hispanic boys, according to Way\u2019s interviews, feel pressure to conform to even stricter rules. Men who break the rules, and express \u201csadness, depression, fear, and dysphoric self-conscious emotions such as shame and embarrassment\u201d are viewed as \u201c unmanly\u201d and are  comforted less than women. Way told me when she speaks in public, she often quotes a 16-year-old boy who said, \u201cIt might be nice to be a girl, \u2018cause then I wouldn\u2019t have to be emotionless.\u201d\n  And yet, it\u2019s easy to be skeptical\u2014aren\u2019t men doing fine, compared to everyone else? How much does this actually hurt men? They still have friends, don\u2019t they? And yes, entering adulthood, and up to the age of 25, men and women do have  approximately the same number of friends. For the outsider looking in, then, and even for the man himself, it may appear that nothing\u2019s amiss. But to paraphrase University of Missouri researchers Barbara Bank and Suzanne Hansford, men have power, but are not well. In the   UK,  suicide rates among men are steadily rising. In the   US, so is\u00a0 unemployment among men, often coupled with opioid abuse. In a  2006 paper addressed to psychiatric practitioners, William S. Pollack of Harvard Medical School wrote, \u201cpresent socialization systems are dangerous to boys\u2019 physical and mental health and to those around them, leading to increased school failure, depression, suicide, lonely isolation, and, in extremis, violence.\u201d In a study Pollack did of boys age 12-18, only 15\u00a0percent\u00a0of them projected \u201cpositive, forward-looking sentiment regarding their futures as men.\u201d\n Women  keep being intimate with their friends into adulthood, and men, generally,  do not: \u201cDespite efforts to dismiss it, the finding that men\u2019s same-sex friendships are less intimate and supportive than women\u2019s is robust and widely documented.\u201d\n Perhaps you want to say that men just like it that way. Perhaps you want to say, like Geoffrey Grief, writing in  Buddy System: Understanding Male Friendships,\u00a0\u201cMen are more comfortable with shoulder-to-shoulder friendships while women prefer face-to-face friendships, which are more emotionally expressive.\u201d Shoulder-to-shoulder meaning: engaging in a shared activity, like playing a game of pick-up basketball, as opposed to confiding face-to-face and being emotionally vulnerable. This may be true for some men, who, like some women, need less intimacy than others. But when asked, men say we  wish we had more intimacy in our friendships with other men.\n \u201cWhat is wrong with men,\u201d Bank and Hansford asked, \u201cthat they can\u2019t or won\u2019t do what they enjoy to the same extent as women do?\u201d In a study of 565 undergraduates, they investigated. Six possible reasons why men shut each other out were measured by questions like \u201chow often [the subject] and their best friend showed affection for each other, had a strong influence on the other, confided in the other, and depended on the other for help.\u201d The worst offenders? Homophobia, and something they called \u201cemotional restraint,\u201d which they measured by responses to statements like \u201cA man should never reveal worries to others.\u201d\n From the vantage point of adulthood, especially in progressive circles, it\u2019s easy to forget the ubiquitous and often quasi-ironic homophobia of teen boys, which circulated among my guy friends. That\u2019s why it was amazing to read  Dude, You\u2019re a Fag by   C. J. Pascoe, 1  1I have to call attention to the fact that so much of the most insightful work on masculinity\u2014Way, Bank, Hansford, Pascoe, Fehr, and others\u2014has been done by women. who spent a year embedded in an American high school divining and taxonomizing the structures of teen male identity in intricate and systemic detail. She concluded that \u201cachieving a masculine identity entails the repeated repudiation of the specter of failed masculinity\u201d\u2014in other words, boys must earn their gender over and over again, often by \u201clobbing homophobic epithets at one another.\u201d And unfortunately, for boys both gay and straight, the rise of gay marriage and queer visibility has not made schoolyards any more tolerant. In fact, Way, who still works with kids in New York City schools, warned that, in contrast to the unselfconscious way straight men can be physically affectionate in repressive societies, in cultures where being gay is a publicly viable option, boys actually feel even   more pressure to prove their straight identity. \u201cI hear that coming from all sorts of sources\u2014parents, kids,\u201d said Way, who notes the simultaneity of the rise of gay acceptance and the phrase \u201c no homo.\u201d\n Way discusses yet another\u00a0reason men may shut each other out: a major betrayal or insult we don\u2019t have the relationship skills to get past. Though they often happen in late adolescence, Way saw the fallout from these formative injuries as \u201ca dramatic loss that appears to have long-term consequences.\u201d\n For all these reasons\u2014the socialization we receive as kids, as well as emotional restraint, homophobia, experiences of betrayal, and many others 2  2Bank  &amp; Hansford\u2019s other four: 1) role conflicts, where men feel their one role, e.g. as a romantic partner, means they cannot continue in another rol\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:26:20", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u519b\u56e2,legion", "title": "\u519b\u56e2\u5b64\u72ec ", "title_en": "The Legion Lonely", "transed": 1, "url": "https://hazlitt.net/longreads/legion-lonely", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u519b\u56e2", "legion"]}]
