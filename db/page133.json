Simple, fast and affordable APIs for everyday use.  Signup for free (no credit card needed) and get $5 of free credit to get started.\n     Micro has evolved from an open source framework to a full blown API platform, one that\u2019s continues to focus on the developer experience first and foremost. The majority of our users are building APIs for end public consumption but having to rebuild many of the building blocks they need wherever they go.\n We wanted to solve that problem by providing a set of programmable building block services as simple APIs for public consumption from anywhere in the world, all in one place.\n  Cache - Ephemeral key-value storage - Store any data up to 1mb for fast key based lookup. Set TTLs to expire entries so you don\u2019t have to remember to delete them.\n  DB - Simple database service - Use CRUD via an API and leave the SQL behind. A really dead simple database service which provides JSON document storage.\n  Crypto - Cryptocurrency prices and quotes - Stay up to date with bitcoin, ethereum, dogecoin and other prices. Track them in real time and build any sort of visualisation on top.\n  Image - Upload, resize and crop images - Upload images, resize on the fly and serve them via a CDN all without having to do anything more than curling our API.\n  OTP - One time password generation - Throwaway the passwords and use one time token generation to login or authenticate users. Simple OTP generation and validation.\n  Routing - Turn by turn directions and etas - A vastly cheaper Google Maps API alternative powered by OSRM. We\u2019ll give you turn by turn routing directions and etas using OpenStreetMap data.\n  Additionally we\u2019ve partnered with third party API providers such as  Finage,  ExchangeRate-API and the  WeatherAPI to bring more functionality to the platform like  Currency conversion,  Stock prices and  Weather forecasts, so you can access everything you need with just one account and one API key, all in one place.

The software giant revealed its surprise Windows 11 addition during its special Windows event today. Android apps will run natively on Windows 11 and will be downloadable from Amazon\u2019s Appstore, via the new Windows Store that\u2019s included in the operating system.\n Microsoft says it\u2019s using Amazon\u2019s Appstore to bring Android apps to Windows 11. Apps will be listed in the new Windows store, and Microsoft is also partnering with Intel to use its Intel Bridge technology to make this a reality. Android apps on Windows 11 can be pinned to the taskbar or snapped alongside traditional Windows apps.\n   Android apps on Windows 11 are an obvious answer to Apple\u2019s progress with its M1 chips and running iOS apps on macOS. While there are many web equivalents to mobile apps, they\u2019re often lackluster, and certain apps like Snapchat, Ring, Venmo, Roomba, and the majority of home automation apps aren\u2019t available on the web.\n Microsoft demonstrated apps like TikTok running on Windows 11 today. The Windows store that Microsoft showed lists Ring, Yahoo, Uber, and others, so we\u2019ll likely see full access to Amazon\u2019s Appstore. It\u2019s not immediately clear how many existing devices will support Android apps with Windows 11, as hardware will need to support Intel Bridge technology.\n   This surprise announcement follows Microsoft\u2019s original plans to  let Windows developers rework their existing Android apps for Windows in 2015. Project Astoria, as Microsoft labeled it, was a method to try to convince developers to port apps and make it easier to do so. The plan eventually fell apart less than a year later, with  Microsoft admitting that having \u201ctwo bridge technologies to bring code from mobile operating systems to Windows was unnecessary.\u201d\n Microsoft has been  toying with the idea of running Android apps on Windows natively for years, and the company had been experimenting with the idea of listing Android apps in the Windows Store just ahead of the Windows 10 launch. Instead, Microsoft pushed ahead trying to convince developers to adopt its  failed Universal Windows Platform.\n Android app integration directly into Windows is a significant shift, especially as the company has been  favoring Your Phone as the method to bridge the gap between Android and Windows. Microsoft has been  embracing Android as the mobile version of Windows for years, and now those same mobile apps will run directly in Windows 11.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 00:10:40", "source_domain":

After months of teases, hints of the number 11, and a  giant Windows 11 leak, Microsoft\u2019s new operating system is official. The big focus for Windows 11 is a simplification of the Windows user interface, a new Windows store, and improvements to performance and multitasking.\n Windows 11 includes a new Start menu and updated Start button that are both centered on the taskbar. This UI is very similar to what we first saw in Windows 10X, a project originally planned for dual-screen devices that Microsoft eventually canceled. A lot of the UI work that went into Windows 10X is appearing in Windows 11.\n  The new Start menu drops the Live Tiles that were originally introduced with Windows 8 and opts for more of the typical launcher you\u2019d find in Chrome OS or Android. There are apps, recent documents, and a separate search interface. Much of the centered appearance is clearly influenced by macOS and Chrome OS, and Windows 11 also includes the rounded corners we\u2019ve seen in both Android and iOS.\n Windows chief Panos Panay says \u201cthe team has obsessed over every detail.\u201d Windows 11 will also include updated dark and light modes, that look a lot better than what we\u2019ve seen in Windows today.\n   There\u2019s also something Microsoft is calling snap layouts, which allow you to quickly snap apps into the various modes that Windows 11 supports. This new version of Windows 11 will also remember where your apps are stored, thanks to something called Snap Group layouts.\n It looks like a useful way to support multiple monitors, and ensure that apps always open on the correct screen. That\u2019s particularly helpful if you\u2019re using a laptop hooked up to a monitor, or a traditional desktop machine with multiple displays.\n Performance is also a big focus for Windows 11. Windows updates are 40 percent smaller, and more efficient as they now happen in the background. Hopefully that will mean that Windows 11 doesn\u2019t disturb you in the middle of work.\n   Microsoft is also integrating Microsoft Teams directly into Windows 11, for both consumers and commercial users. Teams is integrated directly into the taskbar, allowing Windows 11 users to call friends, family, or coworkers. It\u2019s clear that this is a big shift away from Skype, which was bundled as part of Windows 10.\n Windows Widgets and touch gestures are also a big part of Windows 11. Widgets is a personalized feed, powered by AI, and builds on the widgets we\u2019ve seen  Microsoft introduce in Windows 10. It slides in from the left-hand side of Windows 11 and you can also make it fullscreen. Built-in widgets include a news feed, weather, and maps.\n Interestingly, these widgets also include one that lets you tip local creators directly from within Windows 11.\n   Microsoft is also improving the gestures you can use on tablets, and the touch targets. Instead of flipping into a tablet mode, Windows 11 simply adapts to allow you to touch the OS easily.\n Coupled with this are improvements to inking and voice typing. With certain pens, Windows 11 will also support haptic feedback here. That could mean we\u2019ll see a lot of new hardware that will support these stylus changes in Windows 11.\n Xbox is a big part of Microsoft, and we also got to hear from Xbox executive Sarah Bond about PC gaming with Windows 11. Auto HDR, a feature in Xbox Series X / S, will be part of Windows 11. Enabling Auto HDR will add high dynamic range (HDR) to a large number of DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 games, as long as you have a compatible HDR monitor.\n   Microsoft is also promising speed and performance improvements for Windows 11. DirectStorage will be part of Windows 11, a big new feature from Xbox Series X / S. DirectStorage will require the latest NVMe drives to speed up game load times on Windows 11, and game developers will need to enable this technology to boost load times further.\n Xbox Game Pass is also being integrated into Windows 11, thanks to a new Xbox app that the company has been testing for months.

", "note_en": "Long-term complications after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are common in hospitalized patients, but the spectrum of symptoms in milder cases needs further investigation. We conducted a long-term follow-up in a prospective cohort study of 312 patients\u2014247 home-isolated and 65 hospitalized\u2014comprising 82% of total cases in Bergen during the first pandemic wave in Norway. At 6 months, 61% (189/312) of all patients had persistent symptoms, which were independently associated with severity of initial illness, increased convalescent antibody titers and pre-existing chronic lung disease. We found that 52% (32/61) of home-isolated young adults, aged 16\u201330 years, had symptoms at 6 months, including loss of taste and/or smell (28%, 17/61), fatigue (21%, 13/61), dyspnea (13%, 8/61), impaired concentration (13%, 8/61) and memory problems (11%, 7/61). Our findings that young, home-isolated adults with mild COVID-19 are at risk of long-lasting dyspnea and cognitive symptoms highlight the importance of infection control measures, such as vaccination.\n     The respiratory tract is the site of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry and infection; however, COVID-19 is a complex systemic disease, affecting the cardiovascular, renal, hematologic, gastrointestinal and central nervous systems  1. As evidence emerges of predominantly lasting impairment of lung function related to fibrosis, more data on the long-term effects of COVID-19 on other organs are required  2. A plethora of symptoms persist in patients surviving severe COVID-19 (refs.   3, 4), and a long COVID syndrome has been proposed  5, 6. However, the severity and duration of symptoms remain largely unknown. Chronic fatigue occurred after SARS infection in 2003 (ref.   7), and it is well known in the aftermath of a spectrum of infectious diseases  8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, patient management in intensive care was frequently associated with mental and physical decline, and this could partially explain long COVID in patients with severe illness  14. However, the burden of long COVID in mild to moderately ill patients is not well defined. We assessed persistent symptoms 6 months after initial COVID-19 in a prospective cohort of hospitalized and home-isolated patients from the first pandemic wave in Bergen, Norway.\n All patients diagnosed at the only centralized testing facility in the city of Bergen were invited to participate, as well as all patients admitted to the city\u2019s two hospitals: Haukeland University Hospital and Haraldsplass Deaconess Hospital. Recruitment commenced with the first diagnosed home-isolated and the first hospitalized patients; 92% of patients during the first pandemic wave agreed to participate. The objective was to identify factors and biomarkers associated with long-term complications. From 28 February to 4 April 2020, we consecutively recruited 357 patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2. We collected demographic and clinical data as well as blood samples. Household members of patients who tested positive were included to ensure completeness of the cohort, and their infection was diagnosed by SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies at 2 months  15. At 6-month follow-up, the study population available for analysis comprised 312 patients, of whom 247 were home-isolated and 65 were hospitalized (Fig.  1).\n Number of participants eligible for inclusion at baseline, blood sampling at 2 months and assessment and fatigue evaluation at 6 months. BMEC, Bergen Municipality Emergency Clinic; LTF, lost to follow-up.\n The median age of the study population was 46 years (interquartile range (IQR) 30\u201358 years) with 51% (160/312) women. Forty-four percent had comorbidities (137/312), the most frequent being chronic lung disease (12%, 38/312, 34 with asthma), hypertension (11%, 35/312), chronic heart disease (7%, 22/312), rheumatic diseases (6%, 20/312), diabetes (4%, 13/312) and immunosuppressive conditions (4%, 11/312). In 272 patients who recorded symptoms during acute disease, fatigue (90%, 244/272), cough (71%), headache (64%), myalgia (58%) and dyspnea (55%) were the most frequent, whereas only 21% had fever. Hospitalized patients were older than home-isolated patients, had higher body mass index (BMI) and had more comorbidities, including chronic lung disease, chronic heart disease, hypertension and diabetes (Table  1).\n  Sixty-one percent (189/312) of the total patient population had persistent symptoms 6 months after initial COVID-19 illness, with the most common symptoms being fatigue (37%), difficulty concentrating (26%), disturbed smell and/or taste (25%), memory problems (24%) and dyspnea (21%). Whereas the frequency of most symptoms increased with age in the study population, disturbed smell and/or taste was more frequent in people younger than 46 years old (Table  2). Thirty-nine percent of the study population, commonly children and young adults, had no symptoms at 6 months. Even among the 247 home-isolated patients, 55% (136/247) experienced persistent symptoms at 6 months, most commonly fatigue (30%), disturbed taste and/or smell (27%), concentration impairment (19%), memory loss (18%) and dyspnea (15%) (Table  2).\n  The youngest age group (0\u201315 years) rarely suffered persistent symptoms (13%, 2/16), whereas 52% (32/61) of young adults aged 16\u201330 years who were home-isolated for mild to moderate initial illness had persistent symptoms, the most common being disturbed taste and/or smell (28%), fatigue (21%), dyspnea (13%) and impaired concentration (13%) and memory (11%) (Table  2). In these young adults, comorbidity was not significantly associated with persistent symptoms (33% versus 31%,  P\u2009=\u20091) or fatigue (47% versus 27%,  P\u2009=\u20090.2), although numbers of subjects were low.\n Convalescent antibodies reach a plateau approximately 1\u20132 months after infection, providing a general marker for the magnitude of the immune response  16. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein specific IgG and microneutralizing antibody titers detected after 2 months were significantly higher in hospitalized patients than home-isolated patients ( P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001; Extended Data Fig.  1). Increased antibody titers at 2 months were associated with the severity of initial illness, older age and higher BMI in multivariable analysis (Table  3 and Fig.  2; severity score adapted from Beigel et al.  17).\n  The relationship of severity of initial COVID-19 illness and of age with anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike ( a and  b) and microneutralizing antibody titers ( e and  f) at 2 months. The relationship of antibody titers at 2 months with number of persistent symptoms ( c and  g) and total fatigue score according to the Chalder scale ( d and  h) at 6-month follow-up. The 13 symptoms used are listed in Table  2. The severity of illness was as follows: 1\u2014asymptomatic ( n\u2009=\u20095); 2\u2014home-isolated with symptoms ( n\u2009=\u2009242); 3\u2014hospitalized without medical needs ( n\u2009=\u20090); 4\u2014hospitalized with medical needs ( n\u2009=\u200931); 5\u2014hospitalized needing O 2 ( n\u2009=\u200924); 6\u2014hospitalized needing non-invasive ventilation ( n\u2009=\u20094); and 7\u2014hospitalized needing respirator ( n\u2009=\u20096). The cohort was divided into 15-year age groups: 0\u201315 ( n\u2009=\u200916), 16\u201330 ( n\u2009=\u200965), 31\u201345 ( n\u2009=\u200969), 46\u201360 ( n\u2009=\u200990) and &gt;60 ( n\u2009=\u200972).  a,  b,  e and  f show median spike IgG and microneutralizing antibody titers (horizontal line), 25% and 75% quantiles (box), plus 95% confidence intervals (lines) with outliers (dots).  c and  d are violin plots of number of symptoms (up to 13) or fatigue score (values 0\u201333) divided into four categories of spike IgG: &lt;150 ( n\u2009=\u200921), 150\u20134999 ( n\u2009=\u200996), 5,000\u201320,000 ( n\u2009=\u2009103) and &gt;20,000 ( n\u2009=\u200992). 5k,\u20095,000; 20k, 20,000.  g and  h are violin plots of four categories of microneutralizing titers: &lt;20 (neg  n\u2009=\u200942), 20\u201379 ( n\u2009=\u2009107), 80\u2013320 ( n\u2009=\u200992) and &gt;320 ( n\u2009=\u200971). O 2, supplemental oxygen.\n Increased antibody titers as well as pre-existing lung disease were independently associated with both persistent fatigue and total number of symptoms at 6 months in multivariable analysis (Table  4 and Fig.  2c,d,g,h). Severity of initial illness was associated with persistent fatigue and weakly associated with total number of symptoms (Table  4).\n  Post-viral fatigue has been reported afer SARS infection  7 and other viral infections  11, 12, 13. To assess fatigue, we used the Chalder fatigue score, which is validated for adults  18, 19. Fatigue is defined as a total bimodal score of 4 or higher on 11 questions. Thirty percent (69/231) of home-isolated patients, 16 years of age or older, had fatigue at 6 months compared to 63% (39/62) of hospitalized patients. Severe fatigue at 6 months, defined as bimodal score \u22654 + total ordinal score \u226523, was present in 7% (17/231) of home-isolated and 24% (15/62) of hospitalized patients (Supplementary Table  1). In home-isolated patients, the most frequent symptoms of physical fatigue (questions 1\u20137) were tiredness (35%, 81/231), increased need for rest (30%) and lack of energy (29%); the most common symptoms of mental fatigue (questions 8\u201311) were difficulties finding words (23%), difficulties concentrating (19%) and memory problems (18%) (Supplementary Table  1).\n In patients 16 years of age or older, fever during acute illness, severity of initial illness and female gender were associated with fatigue at 6 months in binomial logistic regression (Supplementary Table  2). In addition to female gender, pre-existing lung disease, severity of acute illness and increased convalescent antibody titers were independently associated with increasing fatigue score at 6 months in multivariable analysis (Table  4 and Fig.  2d,h).\n Despite the correlation between severity of initial disease and antibody titers at 2 months, both factors were independently associated with features of long COVID in multivariable analysis (Table  4 and Supplementary Table  2). In stratified analysis of 242 home-isolated patients with low to moderate symptoms, increased antibody titers remained associated with number of symptoms (odds ratio (OR) = 1.56, confidence interval (CI) 1.23\u20131.96) and fatigue score (OR = 1.07, CI 1.02\u20131.12), although the association was not statistically significant for fatigue as a dichotomous variable (OR = 1.48, CI 0.98\u20132.31).\n Our study is novel in assessing long COVID symptoms, not only in hospitalized patients but also in young patients and home-isolated patients with milder disease. A strength is a near-complete, geographically defined cohort of both antibody- and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive patients from the first pandemic wave, including all severities of disease, in an immunologically naive population. The small subgroups are a limitation of this study, and our findings should be confirmed in larger cohorts.\n We found that a large proportion of survivors of COVID-19 in our cohort had persistent symptoms 6 months after their initial illness. Although it has previously been reported that patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19 frequently suffer long-term symptoms  20, 21, 22, 23, we found that more than half of home-isolated, mildly to moderately ill patients with COVID-19 still suffered symptoms 6 months after infection. It is worrying that non-hospitalized, young people (16\u201330 years old) suffer potentially severe symptoms, such as concentration and memory problems, dyspnea and fatigue, half a year after infection. Particularly for students, such symptoms might interfere with their learning and study progress.\n The high prevalence of persistent fatigue in patients with COVID-19 is striking and appears higher than observed after common infections, such as influenza, Epstein\u2013Barr virus mononucleosis and dengue  11, 12, 13. Data from Norway have previously shown slightly lower chronic fatigue prevalence (11%) in the general population  24 than in the present household controls (14%), who were younger and had fewer comorbidities than infected patients but were sampled at the same time. However, this apparent difference might be a coincidence owing to low numbers. Our finding that women had higher prevalence of fatigue concurs with results from an earlier study in the general Norwegian population  24. The association between severity of illness and persistent symptoms agrees with data from hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (ref.   20). As the respiratory tract is the main target organ for COVID-19, our finding of an association between underlying chronic lung disease (mostly asthma) and persistent symptoms, including fatigue, is not surprising.\n The association between severe initial disease and increased antibody titers at 2 months could be due to higher viral load, which could trigger the immune system more profoundly  25. The finding of increased convalescent antibody titers with increasing age could be explained by more severe disease in older people, as age is a known strong risk factor for severe COVID-19. However, by contrast with the immunosenescence observed after influenza infection in the elderly, multivariable analysis indicated that age and severity of illness were independently associated with increased antibody titers. These findings call for enhanced surveillance of COVID-19 mass vaccination programs. Home-isolated patients aged 16\u201330 years with mild COVID-19 are at risk of long-lasting dyspnea and cognitive symptoms. Considering the millions of young people infected during the ongoing pandemic, our findings are a strong impetus for comprehensive infection control and population-wide mass vaccination.\n All participants, or their guardians for children younger than 16 years old, provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee of Western Norway (no. 118664). No compensation was provided to participants beyond reimbursing travel costs to the clinic.\n  As part of a prospective cohort study with long-term follow-up, we consecutively enrolled home-isolated patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the period 28 February to 4 April 2020, during the first wave of the pandemic in Bergen, Norway. For hospitalized patients, we accepted longer inclusion due to delay in hospitalization, up to 6 May. The study population included SARS-CoV-2 RT\u2013PCR-positive patients diagnosed at Bergen Municipality Emergency Clinic and those admitted to the two neighboring city hospitals: Haukeland University Hospital and Haraldsplass Deaconess Hospital. Household contacts of identified patients were invited to participate in the study as secondary cases (seroconverters) or seronegative controls  15. All registered patients with SARS-CoV-2 were invited to participate. The initial rate of participation at inclusion was 92% (278/302); at 2 months, the rate of participation was 88% (336/381, numerator and denominator includes seropositive household members at this time point); and at 6 months, the rate of participation was 82% (312/381). Convalescent serum samples were collected 2 months after infection for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers.\n All testing in Bergen was centralized to the Emergency Clinic and the city\u2019s two hospitals, allowing recruitment of all consenting patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Bergen. In total, 3,319 patients were tested by RT\u2013PCR in the Municipality Emergency Clinic during the period. Of these, 228 tested positive by RT-PCR, and six were excluded because their address was outside of Bergen or because they were admitted to hospital and were categorized as hospitalized. All suspected cases seen at the Municipality Emergency Clinic were examined clinically and diagnosed by medical staff. Patients with moderate disease were sent home for home isolation, or, if considered severe, they were hospitalized. Most of the hospitalized patients were diagnosed upon admission. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for laboratory confirmation. Patients were telephoned with their results of the RT\u2013PCR test, which was conducted at the reference microbiology laboratory in the tertiary hospital. All confirmed home-isolated patients were contacted by telephone with an invitation to join the study. An additional 79 patients were identified through investigation of seroconversion of household members of RT\u2013PCR-positive patients. Telephone interviews were conducted by medical staff to collect clinical and demographic data. Participants attended the University Clinic at 2 months (6\u20138 weeks) and 6 months (\u00b11 month) for follow-up appointments with medical staff where they were interviewed about long-term symptoms.\n  All consenting patients attended a follow-up clinic and were interviewed by medical staff at baseline, 2 months and 6 months. They provided demographic information; clinical information on symptoms at baseline and 6-month follow-up; and information on potential risk factors, including comorbidities and use of medication. Specific symptoms recorded during acute illness included fever, cough, dyspnea, fatigue, myalgia and headache. Participants were asked if they had any comorbidities and, if so, which specific comorbidities from the following: asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, chronic heart disease, hypertension, chronic liver disease, kidney disease, neuromuscular disease, dementia, rheumatic disease, active cancer, other severe chronic disease and immunosuppressive conditions, including genetic immunodeficiency, HIV, organ transplant, and cytostatic or other immunosuppressive treatment. Data were collected on severity of initial illness\u2014that is, need for hospitalization, symptoms during acute illness and need for non-invasive ventilatory support or respirator treatment  17. Radiological investigations were conducted only on hospitalized patients. At 6-month follow-up, all participants aged 16 years or older were invited to complete a validated fatigue questionnaire containing 11 key questions according to the Chalder fatigue scale  18, 19. Fatigue was defined as a total dichotomized score of 4 or higher. Severe fatigue was defined as fatigue plus a total Chalder score of 23 or higher.\n  Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on RT\u2013PCR on samples from nasopharyngeal swabs and on serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity  26. Serum samples were collected 2 months after infection for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C until analyzed. Samples were heat-inactivated for 1 h at 56\u2009\u00b0C before analysis in duplicate by a two-step ELISA for detecting SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies (Southern Biotech, cat. no. 2040-05) to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (screening 1:100 dilution) and the spike protein (confirmation from 1:100 in five-fold dilutions). Endpoint titers were calculated as the reciprocal of the serum dilution giving an optical density value of 3 standard deviations above the mean of historical pre-pandemic serum samples ( n\u2009=\u2009128)  26. Sera with antibodies against the RBD were tested in a microneutralization assay using the local isolate hCoV-19/Norway/Bergen-01/2020 (GISAID accession ID EPI_ISL_541970) in a certified Biosafety Level 3 laboratory as previously described  27. Briefly, sera were tested in duplicate in doubling dilutions starting from 1:20 dilution and mixed with 100 TCID 50 viruses, followed by incubation with rabbit monoclonal IgG against SARS-CoV2 NP (Sino Biological, cat. no. 40143-R019-100) and biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Southern Biotech, cat. no. 4050-08) and extravidin\u2013peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. E2886). The microneutralizing antibody titer is the reciprocal of the serum dilution giving 50% inhibition of virus infectivity. For all control individuals, negative serology was confirmed at 6 months.\n  Data were entered using electronic case report forms in REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture, Vanderbilt University). All analyses were conducted in R version 4.0.3 ( www.r-project.org), and graphs were produced in R using the ggplot and gridExtra packages.

But when the Maryland-based biotech firm Novavax announced its latest  stunning trial results last week, and an efficacy rate of more than 90 percent even against coronavirus variants, the response from the same media outlets was muted in comparison. The difference, of course, was the timing: With three vaccines already authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the nation is \u201c awash in other shots\u201d already, as the  The New York Times put it.\n Practically speaking, this is true. If the FDA sees no urgency, the Novavax vaccine might not be available in the U.S. for months, and in the meantime the national supply of other doses exceeds demand. But the asymmetry in coverage also hints at how the hype around the early-bird vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna has distorted perception. Their rapid arrival has been described in this magazine as \u201c the triumph of mRNA\u201d\u2014a brand-new vaccine technology whose \u201cpotential stretches far beyond this pandemic.\u201d Other outlets gushed about \u201c a turning point in the long history of vaccines,\u201d one that \u201c changed biotech forever.\u201d It was easy to assume, based on all this reporting, that mRNA vaccines had already proved to be the most effective ones you could get\u2014that they were better, sleeker, even   cooler than any other vaccines could ever be.\n But the fascination with the newest, shiniest options obscured some basic facts. These two particular mRNA vaccines may have been the first to get results from Phase 3 clinical trials, but that\u2019s because of superior trial management, not secret vaccine sauce. For now, they are harder and more expensive to manufacture and distribute than traditional types of vaccines, and their side effects are more common and more severe. The latest Novavax data confirm that it\u2019s possible to achieve the same efficacy against COVID-19 with a more familiar technology that more people may be inclined to trust. (The mRNA vaccines delivered efficacy rates of  95 and  94 percent against the original coronavirus strain in Phase 3 trials, as compared with  96 percent for Novavax in its first trial, and now 90 percent against a mixture of variants.\n  Pandemic-vaccine success, as I  wrote last year, was never just about the technology. You needed a good vaccine, sure\u2014but to get it out the door quickly, you also had to have a massive clinical-trial operation going, and it had to be situated in places where the virus would be spreading widely at just the right time. Even if your candidate worked amazingly well, if you weren\u2019t testing it in the middle of a huge outbreak, you\u2019d have to wait a very long time for the evidence to build.\n The precise timing of these studies mattered a great deal in practice. The Phase 3 clinical trials for Pfizer and Moderna, for example, were up and running in the U.S. by late summer 2020, and so they caught the nation\u2019s giant wave of infections in the fall. By the time Novavax had finished recruiting in the U.S. and Mexico,  in February, case rates had been dropping precipitously. This fact alone, independent of any aspect of vaccine technology, did a lot to shape the outcome.\n Corporate strategy was another crucial factor. To \u201cwin\u201d the vaccine race, a company would need to be able to produce high-quality vaccine doses reliably and quickly, and in vast numbers. It would also need to field the challenges of working with multiple regulatory agencies around the world. And it would need to do all of this  at the same time.\n BioNTech, the German company that developed the Pfizer mRNA vaccine, could not have accomplished so much, so quickly by itself. Last October, the company\u2019s CEO, U\u011fur \u015eahin,  told German interviewers that BioNTech had sought out Pfizer for help because of the scale of the clinical-trial program necessary for drug approvals. That strategic partnership, and not simply the \u201ctriumph of mRNA,\u201d was what propelled them past the post. (Moderna had the advantage of its partnership with the National Institutes of Health.) Consider this: The BioNTech-Pfizer first-in-human vaccine study appeared on the U.S. government\u2019s registry of clinical trials on  April 30, 2020\u2014the  same day as the first-in-human vaccine study for Novavax, which would be going it alone. In a parallel universe where Novavax had paired up with, say, Merck, this story could have come out very differently.\n In the meantime, the early success of two mRNA vaccines pulled attention away from the slower progress of other candidates based on the same technology. Just two days after last week\u2019s Novavax announcement came the news that an mRNA vaccine developed by the German company CureVac had delivered a  weak early efficacy rate in a Phase 3 trial, landing below even the 50 percent minimum level set by the World Health Organization and the FDA. \u201c The results caught scientists by surprise,\u201d  The New York Times reported. CureVac is the company that President Donald Trump  reportedly tried to lure to the U.S. early in the pandemic, and the one that Elon Musk  said he would supply with automated \u201cRNA microfactories\u201d for vaccine production. In the end, none of this mattered. CureVac\u2019s mRNA vaccine just doesn\u2019t seem to be good enough.\n The \u201c sobering\u201d struggles of CureVac perfectly illustrate what epidemiologists call \u201csurvivor bias\u201d\u2014a tendency to look only at positive examples and draw sweeping conclusions on their basis. When the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines triumphed,  The  Washington Post suggested that a bet on \u201c speedy but risky\u201d mRNA technology had paid off with a paradigm-shifting breakthrough. Anthony Fauci called the gamble \u201c a spectacular success.\u201d Such analyses usually had less to say about the non-mRNA vaccines that had gotten into clinical trials just as quickly\u2014and about the other mRNA vaccines that were hitting snags along the way.\n Now we\u2019ve seen what happened to CureVac, and that  some mRNA formulations clearly work much better than others.  By one count, nine groups were testing mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in animal studies as of May 2020, and six were expected to be in clinical trials a few months later. By the end of the year, only BioNTech-Pfizer, Moderna, and CureVac had reached Phase 3 testing,  compared with 13 non-mRNA vaccines. Of the nine mRNA-vaccine candidates that were already testing in animals in mid-2020, just two have proved efficacy at this point, while no fewer than  nine vaccines based on more traditional technologies have reached the same mark.\n These other, non-mRNA vaccines have been widely used throughout the world\u2014and some could still make an important difference in the U.S. Although the U.S. has plenty of doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines available right now, demand for them has cratered.  The Washington Post  reports that in 10 states, fewer than 35 percent of American adults have been vaccinated. An international study of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, published in May, found that among the most common online rumors were those alleging particular dangers of mRNA technology\u2014that it leads, for example, to the creation of \u201c genetically modified human beings.\u201d The CDC has also made a point of  debunking the circulating falsehood that COVID-19 vaccines can change your DNA. For a time, it looked as though the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine would help address this worry. It\u2019s based on a fairly new technology, but not as new as mRNA. However, concerns about  tainted doses made at a Baltimore factory and the emergence of a  very rare but serious side effect have pretty much dashed that hope. The Johnson &amp; Johnson single-dose vaccine has reportedly accounted for  fewer than 4 percent of doses administered in the country.\n  In this context, the success of the Novavax vaccine should be A1 news. The recent results confirm that it has roughly the same efficacy as the two authorized mRNA vaccines, with the added benefit of being based on an older, more familiar science. The protein-subunit approach used by Novavax was first implemented for the hepatitis B vaccine, which has been used in the U.S.  since 1986. The pertussis vaccine, which is required for almost all children in U.S. public schools, is also made this way. Some of those people who have been wary of getting the mRNA vaccines may find Novavax more appealing.\n The Novavax vaccine also has a substantially lower rate of side effects than the authorized mRNA vaccines.  Last week\u2019s data showed that about 40 percent of people who receive Novavax report fatigue after the second dose, as compared with 65 percent  for Moderna and more than 55 percent  for Pfizer. Based on the results of Novavax\u2019s  first efficacy trial in the U.K., side effects (including but not limited to fatigue) aren\u2019t just less frequent; they\u2019re milder too. That\u2019s a very big deal for people on hourly wages, who already bear a disproportionate risk of getting COVID-19, and who have been less likely to get vaccinated in part because of the risk of losing days of work to post-vaccine fever, pain, or malaise. Side effects are a big barrier for COVID-vaccine acceptance. The  CDC reported on Monday that, according to a survey conducted in the spring, only about half of adults under the age of 40 have gotten the vaccine or definitely intend to do so, and that, among the rest, 56 percent say they are concerned about side effects. Lower rates of adverse events are likely to be a bigger issue still for parents, when considering vaccination for their children.\n Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have been extraordinary lifesavers in this pandemic, and we may well be heading into a new golden age of vaccine development. (This week, BioNTech started injections in an  early trial for an mRNA vaccine for melanoma.) But  even the best experts at predicting which drugs are going to be important get things wrong quite a bit, overestimating some treatments and underestimating others. Pharmaceuticals are generally a gamble.\n But here\u2019s what we know today, based on information that we have right now:\u00a0 Among several wonderful options, the more old-school vaccine from Novavax combines ease of manufacture with high efficacy and lower side effects. For the moment, it\u2019s the best COVID-19 vaccine we have.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 00:09:15", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "mrna,vaccines,\u75ab\u82d7", "title": "mRNA\u75ab\u82d7\u662f\u975e\u51e1\u7684\uff0c\u4f46Novavax\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d ", "title_en": "The mRNA Vaccines Are Extraordinary, but Novavax Is Even Better", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/06/novavax-now-best-covid-19-vaccine/619276/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["mrna", "vaccines", "\u75ab\u82d7"]}]
