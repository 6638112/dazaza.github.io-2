If we compare the 100 richest people in 1982 tothe 100 richest in 2020, we notice some big differences.  In 1982 the most common source of wealth was inheritance. Of the100 richest people, 60 inherited from an ancestor. There were 10du Pont heirs alone. By 2020 the number of heirs had been cut inhalf, accounting for only 27 of the biggest 100 fortunes.  Why would the percentage of heirs decrease? Not because inheritancetaxes increased. In fact, they decreased significantly during thisperiod. The reason the percentage of heirs has decreased is notthat fewer people are inheriting great fortunes, but that morepeople are making them.  How are people making these new fortunes? Roughly 3/4 by startingcompanies and 1/4 by investing. Of the 73 new fortunes in 2020, 56derive from founders&#39; or early employees&#39; equity (52 founders, 2early employees, and 2 wives of founders), and 17 from managinginvestment funds.  There were no fund managers among the 100 richest Americans in 1982.Hedge funds and private equity firms existed in 1982, but none oftheir founders were rich enough yet to make it into the top 100.Two things changed: fund managers discovered new ways to generatehigh returns, and more investors were willing to trust them withtheir money. [  1]  But the main source of new fortunes now is starting companies, andwhen you look at the data, you see big changes there too. Peopleget richer from starting companies now than they did in 1982, becausethe companies do different things.  In 1982, there were two dominant sources of new wealth: oil andreal estate. Of the 40 new fortunes in 1982, at least 24 were dueprimarily to oil or real estate. Now only a small number are: ofthe 73 new fortunes in 2020, 4 were due to real estate and only 2to oil.  By 2020 the biggest source of new wealth was what are sometimescalled &#34;tech&#34; companies. Of the 73 new fortunes, about 30 derivefrom such companies. These are particularly common among the richestof the rich: 8 of the top 10 fortunes in 2020 were new fortunes ofthis type.  Arguably it&#39;s slightly misleading to treat tech as a category.Isn&#39;t Amazon really a retailer, and Tesla a car maker? Yes and no.Maybe in 50 years, when what we call tech is taken for granted, itwon&#39;t seem right to put these two businesses in the same category.But at the moment at least, there is definitely something they sharein common that distinguishes them. What retailer starts AWS? Whatcar maker is run by someone who also has a rocket company?  The tech companies behind the top 100 fortunes also form awell-differentiated group in the sense that they&#39;re all companiesthat venture capitalists would readily invest in, and the othersmostly not. And there&#39;s a reason why: these are mostly companiesthat win by having better technology, rather than just a CEO who&#39;sreally driven and good at making deals.  To that extent, the rise of the tech companies represents a qualitativechange. The oil and real estate magnates of the 1982 Forbes 400didn&#39;t win by making better technology. They won by being reallydriven and good at making deals.  [  2]And indeed, that way ofgetting rich is so old that it predates the Industrial Revolution.The courtiers who got rich in the (nominal) service of Europeanroyal houses in the 16th and 17th centuries were also, as a rule,really driven and good at making deals.  People who don&#39;t look any deeper than the Gini coefficient lookback on the world of 1982 as the good old days, because those whogot rich then didn&#39;t get as rich. But if you dig into  how theygot rich, the old days don&#39;t look so good. In 1982, 84% of therichest 100 people got rich by inheritance, extracting naturalresources, or doing real estate deals. Is that really better thana world in which the richest people get rich by starting techcompanies?  Why are people starting so many more new companies than they usedto, and why are they getting so rich from it? The answer to thefirst question, curiously enough, is that it&#39;s misphrased. Weshouldn&#39;t be asking why people are starting companies, but whythey&#39;re starting companies again. [  3]  In 1892, the  New York Herald Tribune compiled a list of all themillionaires in America. They found 4047 of them. How many hadinherited their wealth then? Only about 20% — less than theproportion of heirs today. And when you investigate the sources ofthe new fortunes, 1892 looks even more like today. Hugh Rockofffound that &#34;many of the richest ... gained their initial edge fromthe new technology of mass production.&#34; [  4]  So it&#39;s not 2020 that&#39;s the anomaly here, but 1982. The real questionis why so few people had gotten rich from starting companies in1982. And the answer is that even as the  Herald Tribune&#39;s list wasbeing compiled, a wave of   consolidation was sweeping through theAmerican economy. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries,financiers like J. P. Morgan combined thousands of smaller companiesinto a few hundred giant ones with commanding economies of scale.By the end of World War II, as Michael Lind writes, &#34;the majorsectors of the economy were either organized as government-backedcartels or dominated by a few oligopolistic corporations.&#34; [  5]  In 1960, most of the people who start startups today would havegone to work for one of them. You could get rich from starting yourown company in 1890 and in 2020, but in 1960 it was not really aviable option. You couldn&#39;t break through the oligopolies to getat the markets. So the prestigious route in 1960 was not to startyour own company, but to work your way up the corporate ladder atan existing one. [  6]  Making everyone a corporate employee decreased economic inequality(and every other kind of variation), but if your model of normalis the mid 20th century, you have a very misleading model in thatrespect. J. P. Morgan&#39;s economy turned out to be just a phase, andstarting in the 1970s, it began to break up.  Why did it break up? Partly senescence. The big companies thatseemed models of scale and efficiency in 1930 had by 1970 becomeslack and bloated. By 1970 the rigid structure of the economy wasfull of cosy nests that various groups had built to insulatethemselves from market forces. During the Carter administration thefederal government realized something was amiss and began, in aprocess they called &#34;deregulation,&#34; to roll back the policies thatpropped up the oligopolies.  But it wasn&#39;t just decay from within that broke up J. P. Morgan&#39;seconomy. There was also pressure from without, in the form of newtechnology, and particularly microelectronics. The best way toenvision what happened is to imagine a pond with a crust of ice ontop. Initially the only way from the bottom to the surface is aroundthe edges. But as the ice crust weakens, you start to be able topunch right through the middle.  The edges of the pond were pure tech: companies that actuallydescribed themselves as being in the electronics or software business.When you used the word &#34;startup&#34; in 1990, that was what you meant.But now startups are punching right through the middle of the icecrust and displacing incumbents like retailers and TV networks andcar companies. [  7]  But though the breakup of J. P. Morgan&#39;s economy created a new worldin the technological sense, it was a reversion to the norm in thesocial sense. If you only look back as far as the mid 20th century,it seems like people getting rich by starting their own companiesis a recent phenomenon. But if you look back further, you realizeit&#39;s actually the default. So what we should expect in the futureis more of the same. Indeed, we should expect both the number andwealth of founders to grow, because every decade it gets easier tostart a startup.  Part of the reason it&#39;s getting easier to start a startup is social.Society is (re)assimilating the concept. If you start one now, yourparents won&#39;t freak out the way they would have a generation ago,and knowledge about how to do it is much more widespread. But themain reason it&#39;s easier to start a startup now is that it&#39;s cheaper.Technology has driven down the cost of both building products andacquiring customers.  The decreasing cost of starting a startup has in turn changed thebalance of power between founders and investors. Back when startinga startup meant building a factory, you needed investors&#39; permissionto do it at all. But now investors need founders more than foundersneed investors, and that, combined with the increasing amount ofventure capital available, has driven up valuations. [  8]  So the decreasing cost of starting a startup increases the numberof rich people in two ways: it means that more people start them,and that those who do can raise money on better terms.  But there&#39;s also a third factor at work: the companies themselvesare more valuable, because newly founded companies grow faster thanthey used to. Technology hasn&#39;t just made it cheaper to build anddistribute things, but faster too.  This trend has been running for a long time. IBM, founded in 1896,took 45 years to reach a billion 2020 dollars in revenue.Hewlett-Packard, founded in 1939, took 25 years. Microsoft, foundedin 1975, took 13 years. Now the norm for fast-growing companies is7 or 8 years. [  9]  Fast growth has a double effect on the value of founders&#39; stock.The value of a company is a function of its revenue and its growthrate. So if a company grows faster, you not only get to a billiondollars in revenue sooner, but the company is more valuable whenit reaches that point than it would be if it were growing slower.  That&#39;s why founders sometimes get so rich so young now. The lowinitial cost of starting a startup means founders can start young,and the fast growth of companies today means that if they succeedthey could be surprisingly rich just a few years later.  It&#39;s easier now to start and grow a company than it has ever been.That means more people start them, that those who do get betterterms from investors, and that the resulting companies become morevaluable. Once you understand how these mechanisms work, and thatstartups were suppressed for most of the 20th century, you don&#39;thave to resort to some vague right turn the country took underReagan to explain why America&#39;s Gini coefficient is increasing. Ofcourse the Gini coefficient is increasing. With more people startingmore valuable companies, how could it not be?             Notes  [  1]Investment firms grew rapidly after a regulatory change bythe Labor Department in 1978 allowed pension funds to invest inthem, but the effects of this growth were not yet visible in thetop 100 fortunes in 1982.  [  2]George Mitchell deserves mention as an exception. Thoughreally driven and good at making deals, he was also the first tofigure out how to use fracking to get natural gas out of shale.  [  3]When I say people are starting more companies, I mean thetype of company meant to   grow very big. There has actually been adecrease in the last couple decades in the overall number of newcompanies. But the vast majority of companies are small retail andservice businesses. So what the statistics about the decreasingnumber of new businesses mean is that people are starting fewershoe stores and barber shops.  People sometimes get   confused when they see a graph labelled&#34;startups&#34; that&#39;s going down, because there are two senses of theword &#34;startup&#34;: (1) the founding of a company, and (2) a particulartype of company designed to grow big fast. The statistics meanstartup in sense (1), not sense (2).  [  4]Rockoff, Hugh. &#34;Great Fortunes of the Gilded Age.&#34; NBER WorkingPaper 14555, 2008.  [  5]Lind, Michael.  Land of Promise. HarperCollins, 2012.  It&#39;s also likely that the high tax rates in the mid 20th centurydeterred people from starting their own companies. Starting one&#39;sown company is risky, and when risk isn&#39;t rewarded, people opt for  safety instead.  But it wasn&#39;t simply cause and effect. The oligopolies and high taxrates of the mid 20th century were all of a piece. Lower taxes arenot simply a cause of entrepreneurship, but an effect as well: thepeople getting rich in the mid 20th century from real estate andoil exploration lobbied for and got huge tax loopholes that madetheir effective tax rate much lower, and presumably if it had beenmore common to grow big companies by building new technology, thepeople doing that would have lobbied for their own loopholes aswell.  [  6]That&#39;s why the people who did get rich in the mid 20th centuryso often got rich from oil exploration or real estate. Those werethe two big areas of the economy that weren&#39;t susceptible toconsolidation.  [  7]The pure tech companies used to be called &#34;high technology&#34; startups.But now that startups can punch through the middle of the ice crust,we don&#39;t need a separate name for the edges, and the term &#34;high-tech&#34;has a decidedly   retro sound.  [  8]Higher valuations mean you either sell less stock to get agiven amount of money, or get more money for a given amount ofstock. The typical startup does some of each. Obviously you end upricher if you keep more stock, but you should also end up richerif you raise more money, because (a) it should make the companymore successful, and (b) you should be able to last longer beforethe next round, or not even need one. Notice all those shouldsthough. In practice a lot of money slips through them.  It might seem that the huge rounds raised by startups nowadayscontradict the claim that it has become cheaper to start one. Butthere&#39;s no contradiction here; the startups that raise the most arethe ones doing it by choice, in order to grow faster, not the onesdoing it because they need the money to survive. There&#39;s nothinglike not needing money to make people offer it to you.  You would think, after having been on the side of labor in its fightwith capital for almost two centuries, that the far left would behappy that labor has finally prevailed. But none of them seem tobe. You can almost hear them saying &#34;No, no, not  that way.&#34;  [  9]IBM was created in 1911 by merging three companies, the mostimportant of which was Herman Hollerith&#39;s Tabulating Machine Company,founded in 1896. In 1941 its revenues were $60 million.  Hewlett-Packard&#39;s revenues in 1964 were $125 million.  Microsoft&#39;s revenues in 1988 were $590 million.
