"note_en": "A casual visitor to  Scotland might assume that the Gaelic language is thriving, with every police car carrying the word  poileas and every ambulance  ambaileans. Yet in the few places where it is spoken, the language is in a profound, potentially terminal crisis.\n Without radical action, Scots Gaelic will be dead within a decade, according to a study. The language is rarely spoken in the home, little used by teenagers, and used routinely only by a diminishing number of elderly Gaels dispersed across a few island communities in the Hebrides.\n The study by a team of Gaelic experts and socio-linguists at the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) found that only 11,000 people were habitual Gaelic speakers, after a rapid decline during the 1980s when the density of native speakers fell below 80%.\n It forecasts that next year\u2019s national census will find the proportion of people in the Western Isles who speak Gaelic has fallen to nearly 45%, a figure the experts believe puts the language on the verge of non-viability.\n  \u201cWe are in the position where the remaining vernacular networks are in the process of collapsing,\u201d said Prof Conchu\u0301r O\u0301 Giollaga\u0301in, the lead author of the study and an expert in Irish and Scots Gaelic.\n He said an urgent overhaul of policy was needed, with a far greater emphasis on restoring Gaelic as a living, everyday language in its core communities. He suggested there should be a new community-led Gaelic-language trust based in the Western Isles.\n \u201cIt is imperative we have an open and honest discussion,\u201d he said. \u201cThe situation is so critical; the vernacular community is falling apart and those charged with supporting Gaelic need to face up to these issues. More of the same [policies] will give you more of the same crisis.\u201d\n The study will reignite long-running controversies over the status of Gaelic and government strategies. The Scottish government has put heavy emphasis on increasing access to Gaelic education, specifically funding the construction of primary and secondary schools in cities such as Glasgow and Edinburgh.\n  Over the last year the Western Isles council, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, has increased Gaelic education in all schools and made it the default language for all children starting primary, provoking clashes between the Conservatives and the Scottish National party and Scottish Greens at Holyrood.\n O\u0301 Giollaga\u0301in said far greater energy should go into ensuring Gaelic is spoken at home and in every social situation, not just at school. Parents should be \u201cencouraged to speak it to their children, in social and family settings,\u201d he said. Gaelic should be embedded in all aspects of day-to-day life.\n The study, which involved research throughout the Western Isles, in Staffin, a Gaelic-speaking district of Skye, and Tiree, an island in Argyll and Bute, found that even in Gaelic-speaking families, English was the default language. There was \u201cgeneral indifference among the young regarding the place of Gaelic in their lives,\u201d it found.\n O\u0301 Giollaga\u0301in said there was a similar crisis in Ireland, where only about 17,000 people use Irish habitually, despite official figures showing it is spoken by 1.7 million people. Things are in a stronger position with the Welsh language, where about half of the 500,000 people who can speak Welsh do so routinely.\n In both Scotland and Ireland, the trend of putting Gaelic on public signs and official vehicles has masked deep-rooted institutional indifference, O\u0301 Giollaga\u0301in said. These were \u201cpyrrhic, symbolic victories\u201d, where Gaelic was given superficial recognition but remained peripheral to organisations\u2019 work, or where \u201cthe actual speakers\u2019 group is completely marginalised\u201d.\n Mairi MacInnes, the chair of B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig, the board charged with promoting Gaelic, said the study\u2019s findings about a generational divide \u201cwill come as no surprise to anyone\u201d. She said the current strategy, focusing on schooling, had been agreed after widespread consultation.\n Even so, she said, the board was \u201cwilling to discuss with island communities what else they want to happen, in addition to the many positive things which are already in place.\u201d\n A Scottish government spokeswoman said ministers were interested in the study\u2019s conclusions, including its call for new structures. \u201cThe Gaelic language is a vital part of Scotland\u2019s cultural identity and ministers support efforts to improve access for speakers to learn and use the language,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\n \u201cAlthough the Gaelic language is in a fragile condition, there are a range of policies and interventions in place to promote the learning, speaking and use of Gaelic in the islands and these are constantly kept under review.\u201d\n \u2022 This article was amended on 2 July 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to Welsh as a Gaelic

"note_en": "Tesla has surprised Wall Street again with  better-than-expected delivery numbers. The electric carmaker delivered 90,650 vehicles in the second quarter of 2020, up slightly from the  88,400 vehicles delivered in the first quarter. This despite the fact that Tesla&#39;s main factory in Fremont, California, was  shut down by county officials for the  first half of the quarter.\n Tesla&#39;s stock leapt at the news. After closing at a record high of $1,120 yesterday, Tesla&#39;s shares rose above $1,200 in pre-market trading on Thursday morning.\n While Tesla&#39;s Q2 deliveries were up from the previous quarter, they&#39;re down slightly from the\u00a0 95,200 vehicles produced in the\u00a0second quarter of 2019. Tesla also delivered more cars in\u00a0 Q3 and  Q4 of 2019 than it did last quarter. That presumably reflects the effects of the coronavirus over the last two quarters, as well as the phaseout of the federal tax credit for purchasing a Tesla. The credit fell by half on June 30, 2019 and phased out completely on December 31.\n Tesla&#39;s 5 percent decline in year-over-year deliveries compares favorably to  other carmakers. GM suffered a 34 percent year-over-year sales decline in the second quarter of 2020. Fiat Chrysler saw sales fall 39 percent year over year. Other carmakers that have reported so far have seen year-over-year declines ranging between 9 percent and 58 percent.\n Tesla produced 82,272 vehicles in the second quarter, 8,400 fewer than it delivered\u2014which means that Tesla has been drawing down inventories built up prior to the pandemic.\u00a0Tesla says it has now ramped up production to pre-pandemic levels, setting the stage for growth in Q3.\n  In 2018, Tesla delivered almost 25,000 Model S and Model X (combined) per quarter. In 2019, this fell to around 17,000.\n In the first quarter of 2020, Model S and Model X deliveries were at 12,200. In the second quarter, the number was 10,600.\n Cooling interest in these high-end cars likely reflects the fact that Tesla hasn&#39;t done a major refresh of either model in several years. That makes it hard for consumers to justify paying a big premium over the newer Model 3 and Model Y, which accounted for the bulk of Tesla&#39;s sales last quarter.", "posttime": "2020-07-02 22:09:30", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7279\u65af\u62c9,\u4ea4\u8d27,stock,\u4ea4\u4ed8", "title": "\u7279\u65af\u62c9\u80a1\u4ef7\u518d\u6b21\u8dc3\u5347\uff0c\u4ea4\u8d27\u91cf\u51fa\u4eba\u610f\u6599\u5730\u5f3a\u52b2", "title_en": "Tesla stock leaps again on unexpectedly strong delivery numbers", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/07/tesla-stock-leaps-again-on-unexpectedly-strong-delivery-numbers/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7279\u65af\u62c9", "\u4ea4\u8d27", "stock", "\u4ea4\u4ed8"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "de5d731b294f002368259df3e6537dbe.jpg", "infoid": 1009485, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8be5\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u6bcf\u5929\u90fd\u5728\u5173\u6ce8\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u548c\u79c1\u4eba\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u989d\u5916\u7684Crunch\u8ba2\u6237\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u4ea4\u6362\u83b7\u5f97\u5b8c\u5168\u8bbf\u95ee\u6743\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8ba2\u9605\u4f18\u60e025%\u3002\n\u6628\u5929\uff0cLemonade\u548cAcolade\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u9ad8\u4e8e\u9884\u671f\u533a\u95f4\uff0cLemonade\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5176\u9884\u671f\u7684\u4e0a\u8c03\u533a\u95f4\uff0cAcolade\u51fa\u552e\u7684\u80a1\u7968\u6570\u91cf\u8d85\u8fc7\u9884\u671f\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u5e02\u573a\u8981\u6c42\u6210\u957f\u578b\u80a1\u7968\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u592a\u62c5\u5fc3\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u5f88\u96be\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e3e\u63aa\u89e3\u8bfb\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u4f55\u4e1c\u897f\u3002\n\u6216\u8005\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bf4\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5bfb\u6c42\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u4f46\u62c5\u5fc3\u634d\u536b\u5176\u79c1\u52df\u5e02\u573a\u4f30\u503c\u7684\u65e0\u5229\u53ef\u56fe\u7684\u72ec\u89d2\u517d\u516c\u53f8\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u662f\u4e0a\u5e02\u7684\u9ec4\u91d1\u65f6\u523b\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u7eea\u5f97\u5230\u4e86Agora\u6700\u8fd1\u51e0\u5929\u575a\u633a\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u7206\u70b8\u6027\u7684\u9996\u65e5\u4e0a\u5e02\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002\n\u76ee\u524d\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u4e00\u516c\u5f00\u5e02\u573a\u65f6\u523b\u5c06\u6301\u7eed\u591a\u4e45\u3002\u6628\u65e5\u7f8e\u56fd\u5355\u65e5\u5f55\u5f975\u4e07\u5b97\u65b0\u65b0\u51a0\u80ba\u708e\u4e2a\u6848\uff0c\u52a0\u4e0a\u56fd\u6c11\u7ecf\u6d4e\u518d\u5ea6\u5f00\u59cb\u653e\u7f13\uff0c\u6216\u8bb8\u7a97\u53e3\u671f\u77ed\u3002\u6216\u8bb8\u4e0d\u662f-\u6211\u4eec\u4e4b\u524d\u5bf92020\u5e74IPO\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u662f\u9519\u8bef\u7684\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u8981\u592a\u4ed3\u4fc3\u5730\u505a\u51fa\u66f4\u591a\u9884\u6d4b-\u4f46\u5f88\u660e\u663e\uff0c2019\u5e74\u7b2c\u56db\u5b63\u5ea6\u53ef\u80fd\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u72ec\u89d2\u517d\u516c\u53f8\u53ef\u80fd\u80fd\u591f\u5438\u5f15\u5230\u5b83\u4eec\u60f3\u8981\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\n\u4eca\u5929\u4e0a\u5348\uff0c\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u7b80\u5355\u56de\u987e\u4e00\u4e0bLemonade\u548cAculade\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u6210\u4e3a\u4ea4\u6613\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u5929\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u7ed9\u4ed6\u4eec\u65b0\u7684\u6536\u5165\u500d\u6570\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u9996\u6b21\u4eae\u76f8\u4e4b\u524d\u4e86\u89e3\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u516c\u4f17\u751f\u6d3b\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u6211\u4eec\u624d\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4e86\u89e3\u4e0b\u4e00\u6279\u8db3\u591f\u5927\u80c6\u5730\u7ad9\u51fa\u6765\u4e0a\u5e02\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u3002\n\u6700\u8fd1\u51e0\u5468\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6ee5\u7528\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u7684IPO\u6bd4\u55bb\u3002\u6253\u5f00\u7a97\u6237\u3002\u6e29\u6c34\u3002\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u9648\u8bcd\u6ee5\u8c03\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf4\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u51e0\u5468IPO\u8868\u73b0\u975e\u5e38\u597d\uff0cIPO\u7cbe\u54c1\u5e97(IPO Boutique)\u4eca\u5929\u4e0a\u5348\u62a5\u544a\u79f0\uff0c\u6700\u8fd127\u5bb6IPO\u4e2d\u670917\u5bb6\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u9ad8\u4e8e\u6700\u521d\u8bbe\u5b9a\u7684\u533a\u95f4\u3002", "note_en": "The Exchange is a daily look at startups and the private markets for Extra Crunch subscribers; use code EXCHANGE to get full access and  take 25% off your subscription.\n  Yesterday  Lemonade   and  Accolade   priced above their expected ranges, with Lemonade  pricing above its\u00a0 raised range and Accolade  selling more shares than expected.

Perhaps not \u2014 we were wrong before about the IPO market in 2020, so let\u2019s not get too hasty to make more predictions \u2014 but it is clear that  Q4 2019 wasn\u2019t the only time when unicorns might have been able to attract the prices they wanted.\n This morning let\u2019s briefly go over the final pricing for Lemonade and Accolade, and give them new revenue multiples ahead of their first days as trading entities. We need to start their public life knowing how they were valued ahead of their debut so that we can better understand the next set of companies that are bold enough to get off their backside and go public.\n  We\u2019ve abused every possible IPO metaphor in recent weeks. Open windows. Warm waters. But without clich\u00e9, we can state that IPOs are performing very well in recent weeks, with  IPO Boutique reporting this morning that 17 of the last 27 IPOs have priced above the range that they first set.", "posttime": "2020-07-02 22:08:29", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8363\u8a89,flying,ipo", "title": "\n\u67e0\u6aac\u6c34\u548c\u8363\u8a89\u7684\u96c4\u5fc3\u52c3\u52c3\u7684IPO\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u9f13\u52b1\u5176\u4ed6\u72ec\u89d2\u517d\u516c\u53f8\u4e0a\u5e02", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tHigh-flying IPOs for Lemonade and Accolade may encourage other unicorns to go public\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/high-flying-ipos-for-lemonade-and-accolade-may-encourage-other-unicorns-to-go-public/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8363\u8a89", "flying", "ipo"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5f40899a5654252c1867900920a7cfdc.png", "infoid": 1009484, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6b27\u6d32\u9886\u5148\u7684\u79d1\u6280\u589e\u957f\u80a1\u6743\u6295\u8d44\u8005Kennet Partners\u4e0e\u7231\u5fb7\u8499\u5fb7\u7f57\u65af\u67f4\u5c14\u5fb7\u96c6\u56e2(Edmond De Rothschild Group)\u7684\u79c1\u52df\u80a1\u6743\u90e8\u95e8Edmond de Rothschild Private Equity\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5176\u7b2c\u4e94\u53ea\u57fa\u91d1\u201cKennet V\u201d\u7b79\u96c6\u4e862.5\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143(2.23\u4ebf\u6b27\u5143)\u3002\nKennet\u6700\u51fa\u540d\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5b83\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e86\u6536\u636e\u94f6\u884c\u3001Spatial Networks\u548cVLocity\u3001IntelPeer\u548cMedeAnalytics\u7684Exist\u7b49\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u4e1a\u52a1\u3002\u5b83\u8fd8\u6295\u8d44\u4e86Eloomi\u3001Codility\u3001Nuxeo\u548cRimilia\u3002Kennet\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u52df\u96c6\u8fd9\u53ea\u65b0\u57fa\u91d1\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u6b27\u6d32\u548c\u4e9a\u6d32\u5404\u5730\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u3002\nKennet V\u57fa\u91d1\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f00\u59cb\u5728\u82f1\u56fd\u3001\u6b27\u6d32\u548c\u7f8e\u56fd\u5bf9B2B\u3001SaaS\u8fdb\u884c\u65b0\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u3002\n\u901a\u5e38\uff0cKennet\u6295\u8d44\u4e8e\u516c\u53f8\u6536\u5230\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u7b14\u5916\u90e8\u8d44\u91d1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3a\u9500\u552e\u548c\u8425\u9500\u6269\u5f20\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d44\u91d1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u56fd\u9645\u4e0a\u3002\u5b83\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u7d2f\u8ba1\u8d44\u4ea7\u7ea6\u4e3a10\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\nKennet Partners\u8463\u4e8b\u603b\u7ecf\u7406\u5e0c\u52d2\u5c14\u00b7\u9f50\u5fb7\u5c14(Hillel Zidel)\u5728\u7535\u8bdd\u4e2d\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\uff1a\u201c\u6211\u4eec\u5f88\u5e78\u8fd0\uff0c\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8d44\u91d1\u90fd\u662f\u5728Covid\u88ad\u51fb\u4e4b\u524d\u7b79\u96c6\u7684\u3002\u4f46\u6211\u4eec\u4ecd\u7136\u80fd\u591f\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6211\u4eec\u73b0\u5728\u6b63\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u53ea\u57fa\u91d1\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u5b83\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4eba\u4eec\u51fa\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u800c\u6d8c\u5411\u79d1\u6280\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8fd9\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u81f3\u5c11\u9700\u8981\u4e94\u5e74\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u201c\u3002\nEdmond de Rothschild Private Equity\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u7ea6\u7ff0\u5c3c\u00b7\u57c3\u5c14-\u54c8\u8d6b\u59c6(Johnny El-Hachem)\u5728\u4e00\u4efd\u58f0\u660e\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\uff1a\u201c\u6211\u4eec\u4e0eKennet\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u559c\u6b22\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u6d3b\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u4e1a\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d44\u91d1\u7684\u6218\u7565\u3002COVID\u5371\u673a\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5176\u4e2d\u8bb8\u591a\u5de5\u5177\u5bf9\u4e1a\u52a1\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u201c", "note_en": "Thus it is that  Kennet Partners, a leading European technology growth equity investor, has raised $250m (\u20ac223m) for its fifth fund, \u2018Kennet V\u2019, in partnership with Edmond de Rothschild Private Equity, the Private Equity division of the Edmond de Rothschild Group.\n Kennet is perhaps best know for its involvement in companies such as Receipt Bank, Spatial Networks and its exist from Vlocity, IntelePeer, and MedeAnalytics. It\u2019s also invested in Eloomi, Codility, Nuxeo and Rimilia. In raising this new fund, Kennet says it exceeded its target and secured new investors from across Europe and Asia.\n  The Kennet V fund has already started to deploy the capital into new investments in B2B, SaaS across the UK, Europe and the US.\n Typically, Kennet invests in the first external funding that companies receive and is used to finance sales and marketing expansion, particularly internationally. It\u2019s cumulative assets managed are approximately $1 billion.\n Hillel Zidel, managing director,  Kennet Partners,   told me by phone that: \u201cWe were fortunate in that most of the capital was raised just before Covid hit. But we were still able to bring additional investors in. Had we been designing a fund for now, then this would have been it, because people have rushed towards technology out of necessity. So this has brought forward digitization but at least five years.\u201d\n Johnny El-Hachem, CEO, Edmond de Rothschild Private Equity said in a statement: \u201cWe partnered with Kennet, because we liked the dynamism of the team coupled with their strategy of financing businesses providing mission-critical technology solutions. The COVID crisis has underscored the importance of many of these tools to business continuity.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-07-02 22:08:07", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot",

"note_en": "Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s closest confidante who hasn\u2019t been seen in public since his death, has been arrested by the FBI in New Hampshire, the Daily Beast has confirmed.\n The elusive British socialite has been accused of involvement in Epstein\u2019s alleged sexual crimes,  and a report by NBC News says she has been arrested on as-yet unspecified charges related to Epstein. She is reportedly expected to appear in federal court later on Thursday.\n After  Epstein&#39;s apparent jailhouse suicide, the hunt was on for the deceased financier\u2019s longtime consort whom he  once described as his \u201cbest friend,\u201d and who was complicit in the sexual trafficking of underage girls, victims say.\n Maxwell is also facing a  lawsuit from Jennifer Araoz, who claims Epstein repeatedly sexually assaulted her at his Manhattan townhouse beginning in 2001. At the time, Araoz was 14 and attending New York\u2019s Talent Unlimited High School. She claims Epstein raped her on one occasion when she was 15 years old.\n According to Araoz\u2019s complaint, Maxwell hired the young recruiter who approached Araoz outside her school and \u201coversaw the process that lead to the recruitment and grooming of\u201d Aroaz for Epstein. Maxwell is believed to have contacted Araoz directly to arrange visits to the Upper East Side mansion, the lawsuit says.\n Maxwell\u2014the daughter of the late, disgraced  British media tycoon Robert Maxwell\u2014hobnobbed with the global elite, forging bonds with the Clintons (she attended Chelsea Clinton\u2019s wedding in 2010) and Donald Trump. She also partied with Britain\u2019s Prince Andrew, whom she introduced to Epstein. Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre claims  she was forced to have sex with the prince when she was a teenager. (Buckingham Palace has denied the allegations.)\n After her father\u2019s death in 1991, Maxwell moved to New York, immersed herself in the city\u2019s social circuit, and dated the mysterious Jeffrey Epstein. Their romance faded, but  she became his major-domo, traveling companion and\u2014according to Epstein\u2019s victims and their lawyers\u2014his accomplice in an international child sex-trafficking ring.\n Epstein\u2019s accusers have long claimed Maxwell recruited, groomed and sexually abused the minor girls who visited Epstein\u2019s lairs in New York and Florida. During their 2005 investigation, Palm Beach cops tried to interview Maxwell but couldn\u2019t reach her,  according to unsealed testimony by retired detective Joseph Recarey. (Maxwell\u2019s lawyers pointed out, in one court filing, that Recarey \u201cfailed to uncover any evidence\u201d against her and that she \u201cwas never considered a suspect by the government.\u201d)\n In 2009, Maxwell was identified as a recruiter for Epstein in a lawsuit filed by Giuffre, who was then identified only as Jane Doe 102. The suit was one of many filed by victims after Epstein\u2019s 2007 sweetheart deal with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Miami. While cops found Epstein molested dozens of girls, Epstein pleaded guilty to two state charges and served only 13 months in jail, mostly on  work release.\n Giuffre went public in an interview with the  Daily Mail in 2011, and again accused Maxwell of facilitating her sexual encounters with Epstein and Prince Andrew. She told the tabloid that when she was 18, Epstein hinted she was \u201ctoo old\u201d for him, and that he and Maxwell once suggested Giuffre have Epstein\u2019s child. \u201cThey said I would have to sign a contract relinquishing rights to the child and consenting to Jeffrey having as many relationships as he liked,\u201d Giuffre told the  Mail. \u201cIt was a smack in the face.\u201d\n One January 2015 court filing by Giuffre further implicated Maxwell. She said that when she was 15 or 16, Epstein and Maxwell \u201ctrained me to do what they wanted, including sexual activities and the use of sexual toys\u201d in New York and Florida.\n \u201cGhislaine Maxwell was heavily involved in the illegal sex. I understood her to be a very powerful person. She used Epstein\u2019s money and he used her name and connections to gain power and prestige,\u201d Giuffre stated in the declaration. \u201cOne way to describe Maxwell\u2019s role was as the \u2018madame.\u2019 She assumed a position of trust for all the girls, including me.\u201d\n But Maxwell allegedly used that trust to also sexually abuse dozens of girls herself and take nude photos of them, Giuffre claimed.", "posttime": "2020-07-02 21:48:02", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7ea2\u989c,maxwell,\u7231\u6cfc\u65af\u5766", "title":

"note_en": "Contact(s):   Caroline Brooks  Communications and Brand Strategy  office: 517-432-0920   brooks78@msu.edu,   Joseph Cesario  Psychology  office: 517-355-0203   cesario@msu.edu  **Researcher&#39;s note: &#34;As noted in the published research, analyses on nationwide crime data cannot speak to the causes of any specific police-citizen interaction, nor should it be used to justify it. Our analyses tested for racial disparities in fatal officer shootings \u2013 which should not be conflated with racial bias. Moreover, the analyses only looked at fatal police shootings and not tragic deaths by police due to other causes and we stress that these findings cannot incriminate or exonerate officers in any specific case.&#34;\n  The authors would like to note that the interpretation of this research has come under criticism by Knox and Mummolo ( https://www.pnas.org/content/117/3/1261). Although the authors addressed the issues raised in a reply ( https://www.pnas.org/content/117/3/1264), they are currently reanalyzing data to more directly address the criticism.\n  Reports of racially motivated, fatal shootings by police officers have garnered extensive public attention and sparked activism across the nation. New research from Michigan State University and University of Maryland reveals findings that flip many of these reports on their heads \u2013\u00a0white police officers are not more likely to have shot minority citizens than non-white officers.\n  \u201cUntil now, there\u2019s never been a systematic, nationwide study to determine the characteristics of police involved in fatal officer-involved shootings,\u201d said Joseph Cesario, co-author and professor of psychology at MSU. \u201cThere are so many examples of people saying that when black citizens are shot by police, it\u2019s white officers shooting them.\u00a0In fact, our findings show no support that black citizens are more likely to be shot by white officers.&#34;\n  The findings \u2013  published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, or PNAS \u2013 are based on an independent database Cesario and his team created that catalogued each police shooting from 2015. The team \u2013 led also by co-author David Johnson from University of Maryland \u2013 contacted every police department that had a fatal police shooting to get the race, sex and years of experience for every officer involved in each incident. The team also leveraged data from police shooting databases by The Washington Post and The Guardian.\n  \u201cWe found that the race of the officer doesn\u2019t matter when it comes to predicting whether black or white citizens are shot,&#34; Cesario said. &#34;If anything, black citizens are more likely to have been shot by black officers, but this is because black officers are drawn from the same population that they police. So, the more black citizens there are in a community, the more black police officers there are.\u201d\n  The data show that it\u2019s not racial bias on behalf of white officers relative to black officers when it comes to fatal shootings, and that\u2019s good news. The bad news, Cesario said, is that internal policy changes, such as diversifying police forces, may not reduce shootings of minority citizens.\n  Beyond officer race, the team drew other conclusions about details related to racial disparities in fatal officer shootings.\n  \u201cMany people ask whether black or white citizens are more likely to be shot and why. We found that violent crime rates are the driving force behind fatal shootings,\u201d Cesario said. \u201cOur data show that the rate of crime by each racial group correlates with the likelihood of citizens from that racial group being shot. If you live in a county that has a lot of white people committing crimes, white people are more likely to be shot. If you live in a county that has a lot of black people committing crimes, black people are more likely to be shot. It is the best predictor we have of fatal police shootings.\u201d\n  By connecting the findings of police officer race, victim race and crime rates, the research suggests that the best way to understand police shootings isn\u2019t racial bias of the police officer; rather, by the exposure to police officers through crime.\n  The vast majority \u2013 between 90% and 95% \u2013 of the civilians shot by officers were actively attacking police or other citizens when they were shot. Ninety percent also were armed with a weapon when they were shot. The horrific cases of accidental shootings, like mistaking a cell phone for a gun, are rare, Cesario said.\n  \u201cWe hear about the really horrendous and tragic cases of police shootings for a reason: they\u2019re awful cases, they have major implications for police-community relations and so they should get attention,\u201d Cesario said. \u201cBut, this ends up skewing perceptions about police shootings and leads people to believe that all fatal shootings are similar to the ones we hear about. That\u2019s just not the case.\u201d\n  One thing that was surprising to the researchers, Cesario said, were the number of mental health cases that resulted in fatal officer shootings.\n  \u201cIt was truly striking and we didn\u2019t recognize just how many there were,\u201d he said. \u201cThis shows how underappreciated mental health is in the national discussion of fatal officer shootings.\u201d\n  Nearly 50% of all fatal shootings involving white civilians were because of mental health; it also accounted for nearly 20% of black civilians and 30% of Hispanics. These included two types of mental health cases: the first was \u201csuicide by cop,\u201d in which civilians intentionally antagonize the police because they want an officer to kill themselves; the second was a result of mental disorders, such as when a civilian is suffering from schizophrenia and poses a threat to officers.\n  Although white officers are not more likely than black officers to shoot black citizens when looking at all fatal shootings, the data are too uncertain to draw firm conclusions once different subtypes of shootings, such as shootings of unarmed citizens, are examined. This is because these types of shootings are too rare for strong conclusions to be drawn.\n  Cesario said that better record keeping \u2013 such as the FBI&#39;s National Use-of-Force Data Collection, which launched in 2019 \u2013 will enable researchers to understand police shootings in finer detail.\n    (Note for media: Please include a link to the original paper in online coverage: https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/07/16/1903856116)", "posttime": "2020-07-02 21:46:31", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "database,\u6570\u636e\u5e93,\u8b66\u5bdf", "title": "\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u63a2\u7d22\u8b66\u5bdf\u67aa\u51fb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u89c1(2019\u5e74)", "title_en": "Research database explores racial bias in police shootings (2019)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2019/new-research-database-explores-racial-bias-in-police-shootings/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["database", "\u6570\u636e\u5e93", "\u8b66\u5bdf"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d9bd761cc4ef714bc5b0ffa13edf5766.png", "infoid": 1009480, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u6b63\u5728\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u8fd0\u884c\u6a21\u7cca\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u5c31\u50cf\u8bb8\u591a\u5176\u4ed6\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u4e00\u6837\u3002\u9664\u6b64\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3aGoogle\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u53cdsystemd\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6ca1\u6709Google\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u5728systemd\u4e0a\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u4e14Google\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u4e0esystemd\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4eba\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5de5\u8d44\u5355\u4e0a\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0cChromeOS\u4e0d\u505asystemd\uff0cKubernetes\u5bf9systemd\u4e00\u70b9\u4e5f\u4e0d\u53cb\u597d\uff0c\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8c37\u6b4c\u5728\u67d0\u79cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4ecb\u4e8e\u4e0d\u559c\u6b22systemd\u548c\u4e0d\u5728\u4e4esystemd\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002", "note_en": "Google is running fuzzing infrastructure for us, like for a lot of other open source projects.

"note_en": "What is the feasibility of survival on another planet and being self-sustaining? This question is of particular importance for the future of the space conquest and perhaps also for the future of humanity in general [1,2]. The use of  in situ resources and different social organizations have been proposed [3\u20136,12\u201319] but there is still a poor understanding of the problem\u2019s variables. I show here that a mathematical model can be used to determine the minimum number of settlers and the way of life for survival on another planet, using Mars as the example [6,15]. It is based on the comparison between the time requirements to implement all kinds of human activities for long term survival and the available time of the settlers. An important parameter of the model is called the sharing factor, which allows some reduction of time requirements per individual if, for example, the activity concerns the construction of an object that can be shared by several individuals. For survival on Mars, some assumptions are made for the organization of the settlers and engineering issues [13\u201315]. The minimum number of settlers has been calculated and the result is 110 individuals. Other assumptions can be made. The proposed method allows assessments and comparisons, opening the debate for the best strategy for survival. If this relatively low number is confirmed, survival on another planet might be easier than expected, provided that the organization of the settlers is appropriate.\n     Humanity could be threatened with extinction due to some cataclysmic event  1. As pointed out by Sagan, in this case, the only possible way to avoid the end of the world as we know it might be to settle another planet within a short period of time  2. But what is the feasibility of survival on another planet for a small group of humans? The problem has already been addressed in terms of sufficient genetic diversity and social adaptation by several authors  3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Marin and Beluffi showed that earlier studies were too constrained  6. They performed simulations with different multi-generational population sizes and determined on a statistical basis that the group of humans could reasonably survive if the initial size were to be greater than 98. However, the problem has not been addressed in terms of engineering capacities and human resources for long-term survival.\n Considering time and payload constraints, the number of people that could be sent to another planet would be rather limited. Space X is currently working on a giant reusable interplanetary vehicle with the objective of sending 100 persons at a time to the red planet. However, this is an optimistic estimate of the capability, the feasibility of the reusability remains uncertain and the qualification of the vehicle for landing on Mars and relaunch from Mars could be very difficult and take several decades. In most well studied mission to Mars scenarios, which last at least 6 months for the outbound trip and for crews of 3 to 6 astronauts, it is suggested to use several giant rockets to carry only a few dozens of tons of consumables to the red planet  8, 9, 10, 11. While on the planet, many authors proposed a settlement process based on the utilization of resources that can be found in the atmosphere or in the soil of the planet  12, 13, 14, 15. For instance, Zubrin proposed to extract carbon dioxide from the Martian atmosphere and water ice from the soil to produce oxygen and organic compounds, hematite to produce iron, silicates to produce glass, etc.  13. Even if the feasibility of the approach is generally acknowledged, the complexity of the implementation is poorly understood and the number of items that would remain to be sent each year would still represent a tremendous challenge. From a practical point of view, it is not clear how many years it would take, as a minimum, to achieve a reasonable level of self-sufficiency, how many rockets would be required to send resources and goods and what would be the way of life and the organization of the society during the development period. If a slow settlement process is already a great challenge, what if time and payloads were constrained and the objective was the long term survival of the group without help from Earthlings?\n Similar issues arise for interstellar travel. In the pioneering works from O\u2019Neill, Bond and Martin, or Matlof, the long term survival of a small group of humans has been addressed  16, 17, 18. Engineering and human factor issues were highlighted, especially the reliability of systems, knowledge management and psychology but the feasibility remained uncertain and not well understood. An important question, which is addressed in this paper, is to determine the minimum number of individuals in terms of human resources and the most appropriate organization to survive on an extra-terrestrial world, which might eventually be artificial. In a more recent paper, Hein  et al. revisited the issue of world ships for interstellar travel  19. Interestingly, the last words of their conclusion were: \u201cAll issues related to determining an adequate crew size will have a major impact on the feasibility of a world ship\u201d. It should be noticed that this question is also of interest if the objective is to settle on a given planet according to a slow and well-established plan. Indeed, there exist many possible dramatic reasons that may cause the failure of such a plan. Suppose for instance that a settlement has already started and that there are regular space trips towards the planet. In case of war on Earth, important space sector infrastructures may be destroyed, causing a long term interruption in space travel. It could also happen that a conflict occurs between the terrestrial governments and the settlers and, later on, a group declares independence and tries to survive on its own. Another reason could be the will of a new government to stop the settlement process because of the never-ending increasing cost.\n For all these reasons, the problem of determining the minimum number of individuals for survival is of interest. It is possible to make assumptions and to discuss different scenarios but what is generally lacking is a methodology to perform quantitative assessments, especially for engineering issues. The objective of the paper is to show that mathematical modelling of the problem is possible. In next paragraphs, a mathematical expression is proposed and the parameters are discussed. A case study is also presented concerning survival on Mars. Some assumptions are made and the minimum number of individuals to survive on Mars is determined.\n The problem can be mathematically defined in different ways. Basically, regarding human resources, the minimum number of individuals for survival depends on their capacity to produce essential objects and consumables using local resources. The initial state of the settlement is very important because large quantities of resources and modern tools may help a lot in developing industries and achieving a viable state. However, there are two reasons suggesting that the impact of the initial state is not so important. On the one hand, a limiting factor is the cost and complexity of interplanetary trips. On the other hand, the lifetime of modern tools such as vehicles, computers, robots, etc. is in general in the order of ten years, which is very short and implies finding quickly solutions to replace them. For the sake of simplicity, it is assumed here that the initial amount of resources and tools sent from Earth will be rather limited and as a consequence will not have much impact on survival. Providing that the initial state is viable, it is assumed that survival depends only on two important variables:\n Available local resources. A local resource can be a gas, mineral or liquid present on the surface of the planet. It is available if its exploitation is possible to extract useful chemical elements. Specific chemical elements have to be found on the planet for survival (water, oxygen, etc.). They must exist as available local resources or they have to be produced from the exploitation of other local resources.\n Production capacity. The production capacity is defined by the number of items (consumables, tools, \u2026) that can be produced among the list of all items needed for survival for a given period of time. For a given number of settlers, the capacity has to reach an acceptable threshold allowing survival and development of the settlement.\n   requirements and capacities can only be compared for a given period of time. It is proposed here to consider the orbital period of the planet (OP) as the reference time for comparisons. As many objects have a longer lifetime (life support systems, habitation, etc.) the time for their maintenance, repair or reconstruction has to be taken into account using a proportion of the OP. If it is possible to find appropriate resources on the planet, the working time requirements and the working time capacity depend on:\n  As the number of people grows, the needs for survival also grow. Nevertheless, as some objects can be shared among several individuals (e.g., a habitat or a vehicle), the working time requirements grow slower than the working time capacity. It is therefore expected that, above a minimum number of individuals, the constraint is satisfied and survival becomes possible.\n  The right hand part of the expression is the working time capacity. \u201cworking\u201d is defined here in the broad sense, excluding sleeping, eating, hygiene and resting, but including activities such as raising babies, preparing meals and social activities, which are required for mental health and cohesion of the group. An estimation can easily be provided. The cumulated annual living time is given by the orbital period times the number of individuals. Part of this time is used for sleeping (one third), or for eating, hygiene, and resting (one twelfth). In addition, children and elderly persons are less productive. About one fourth of the population is assumed unproductive. All in all, the annual working time capacity is estimated at 31.25% of the annual living time. See methods for the details.\n  The annual working time requirements can be estimated by determining the set of all essential human activities required for survival. Obviously, in order to fulfil fundamental needs such as breathing, eating, or raising children, various industrial processes have to be implemented. For instance, the construction of a new building might require extracting specific ores and the use of tools made of iron, which implies an iron industry. For survival with a short number of individuals, the working time requirements have to be minimized. As a consequence, it is necessary to minimize the number of industries and at the same time to maximize productivity using modern tools. A trade-off must therefore be found between the productivity rate and the small size of the industrial development. As a first approach to the problem, a possible approach is to split human activities into 5 domains, as illustrated Fig.\u00a0 1:\n d 1: In the domain of  ecosystem management, the main activities are designing and maintaining systems for the production of appropriate gases, controlling air composition, pressure and temperature in habitable modules, collecting, producing and recycling water, controlling life cycles of all living organisms, processing organic wastes, growing plants for agriculture and finally producing and storing food.\n d 2: In the domain of  energy production, depending on the strategy, for instance if it is decided to use photovoltaic cells to produce electricity and to produce methane for vehicles, the main activities are linked to the extraction and processing of silicates, producing photovoltaic cells, wires, and extracting methane thanks to a Sabatier reactor. Heating also belongs in this category.\n d 3: In the domain of  industry, especially metallurgy and chemistry, the main activities are extracting, collecting and processing appropriate ores, making construction materials, manufacturing objects, and producing tools for other activities (e.g., agriculture). Industry may also be concerned in the production of glass, ceramics and plastics, as well as clothes and medicine depending on the strategic choices for survival.\n d 4:  Building domain. Even if a base is built before the arrival of humans, it will have to be frequently reorganized according to the evolution of the settlement (number of settlers, new industries, new organization of the work, new way of life, etc.). In addition, the lifetime of any construction is limited. New habitable zones with new ecosystems and new factories will have to be built close to interesting local resources. Everything will have to be designed and organized for good living conditions and optimization of the work. All activities linked to the architecture, organization (or reorganization), maintenance and construction of buildings are included here.\n d 5: The last domain concerns  social activities. For survival and for the development of the settlement (without development, a small settlement could easily collapse), it is important to raise children and to educate them. It is therefore assumed that the growing rate of the population is positive. Other fundamental human activities concern health care, preparing meals, cleaning, washing, organizing the work and making decisions. For survival, time for sport, culture and entertainment can be minimized, but probably not totally eliminated.\n  Importantly, for each activity, some margins must be taken into account to cope with unforeseen events. Other activities must concern adaptations of processes to the size of the population and time for reorganization and industrial mutations.\n  As the number of individuals grows in the settlement, more and more objects are shared among them. For instance, people can live in the same habitat, sharing the same air revitalization system, the same water processing system, the same energy production system, etc. If each settler was completely isolated and no sharing was possible, each individual would have to perform all activities and the total time requirement would be obtained by a multiplication by the number of individuals. In addition, a greater number of individuals makes it possible to be more efficient through specialization and to implement other industries allowing the use of more efficient tools. In order to take the possibility of sharing and productivity into account, a sharing factor can be introduced. The time requirement for a given single activity can be simply divided by this factor, which would be different for each activity and for each number of individuals. The sharing factor can be estimated by different functions (polynomial, trigonometric, step functions, etc.). In a restricted range, it can be conveniently estimated by Eq. ( 2). See Methods for a detailed analysis of the sharing factor.\n       Remark: The sharing factor depends on the needs, the processes, the resources and environmental conditions, which may be different depending on the planet.\n  A mathematical expression of constraint (1) can now be obtained. As the total working time capacity is linearly correlated with the number of individuals and the way of calculating the total time requirement for all activities is also a factor of n, n can be eliminated in both sides of the equation.\n    \\(r({a}_{j,i})\\) is the individual annual working time requirement to run activity   i in domain  \\({{\\boldsymbol{d}}}_{{\\boldsymbol{j}}}\\).\n   The individual annual working time requirement can be estimated for each activity. Sharing factors are thus the only parameters defined as functions of   n (Eq. ( 2)). The minimum number of settlers for survival is therefore the minimum value of   n for which constraint (3) is respected.\n  Even if there are enough individuals for the production of goods, a small society can collapse for many different reasons. According to Marin and Beluffi, these reasons can be infertility, inbreeding, sudden deaths (genetic issues included  7), accidents or random events  6. Other important risks with severe impacts concern the loss of important assets, the loss of large amounts of resources, mortal fights among different groups of individuals, or a significant loss of efficiency at work due to inappropriate social organization (e.g., loss of know-how, loss of motivation, bureaucracy, etc.). In order to mitigate the risks, a possible option is to produce more than the minimum. This is especially true at the beginning of the settlement, as any accident could dramatically reduce the production capacity. In the early stages, the severity of the risks also depends on the initial state. In order to mitigate the risks, it will therefore be important to start with large amounts of resources and spare parts. Complementary studies are needed using simulations with different parameters to assess the probability of success for the proposed minimum number of settlers.\n The method is applied to the survival on Mars. The objective is to determine the minimum number of individuals that is compatible with constraint (3). The difficulty is to determine the best trade-off among the different parameters, especially the types of resources that will be exploited, the industries that will be implemented, the organization of the work, the way of life, etc. The specific utilization of Martian resources for life support, agriculture and industrial production has been studied in different workshops and published in reports and books  12, 13, 14, 15. As the complexity of the problem is high, the viability and optimality of any set of choices will remain uncertain. In a recent contest organized by the Mars Society, people were asked to define a realistic scenario to settle the red planet. As our proposal was based on conservative assumptions and the ability to survive if the help from Earthlings were stopped, it is proposed here to use it as a guideline  15. See Methods for more details about our hypotheses.\n  The total working time requirement per individual to implement each activity has been calculated as a function of the number of individuals. According to Eq. ( 3), survival is possible only if the working time requirement is less than the working time capacity. As the working time requirement per individual is decreasing with the number of individuals (thanks to sharing factors), the determination of the minimum number of individuals for survival is straightforward. The result is presented Fig.\u00a0 2. The minimum number of individuals for survival on Mars is 110.\n Determination of the minimum number of individuals for survival on Mars. The annual working time capacity is greater than the annual working time requirement if the initial number of individuals is greater than 110.\n Another interesting result is the distribution of the working time requirement for one individual in comparison with the individual time requirement for 110 individuals (see Fig.\u00a0 3). For a single person, the problem is to implement all industrial activities, while for 110 persons, half of the working time requirement is in the domain of social activities, including raising babies, health care and cultural events.\n An original method has been proposed to determine the minimum number of individuals for survival on another planet or in space, using Mars as the example. It is based on the comparison between the required working time to fulfil all the needs for survival and the working time capacity of the individuals. An important parameter of the model is the sharing factor, which is used to take sharing and productivity into account. In the example provided to illustrate the method, the estimated minimum number of individuals for survival on Mars is 110. This is obviously a rough estimate with numerous assumptions and uncertainties.

"note_en": "In the past year, it\u2019s seen one of the most profitable venture-backed exits of any tech ecosystem (with the $4 billion sale of Honey to PayPal) and investors are minting billion-dollar companies in the region at a torrid pace. It\u2019s also the city where investors are spending the most money outside of venture capital\u2019s big major hubs: San Francisco, Boston and New York.\n While Los Angeles has a lot going for it, that also means it potentially has a lot to lose in the current economic downturn. California continues to be hard-hit by COVID-19, despite local and state officials working to reopen businesses.\n TechCrunch surveyed some of the city\u2019s leading investors in sectors like property technology and cannabis to get their take on how the city may survive \u2014 and potentially thrive \u2014 in a new era ushered in by the response to the pandemic.\n From larger fund investors like  Mark Suster   and Kara Nortman at Upfront Ventures to Dana Settle at Greycroft Partners; to early-stage investors like Will Hsu at Mucker Capital; TX Zhuo at Fika Ventures, the responses were generally upbeat about the future opportunities for Los Angeles startups.\n Even specialist fund investors like  Karan Wadhera   of the cannabis-focused investment firm  Casa Verde Capital   and Brendan Wallace at the real estate-focused firm Fifth Wall believe that Los Angeles will thrive in the post-COVID world.\n As  Mucker Capital   co-founder Hsu writes, \u201cThere are far more great companies than there are venture dollars here in LA. Investors in other cities should continue to see LA as an underserved ecosystem with huge opportunities.\u201d\n    How much is Upfront focused on investing in the local LA ecosystem versus less geographically focused?\n Upfront invests about 40% of its investment dollars in the great LA market and invests about 40% split between the Bay Area and NYC. Upfront has always invested nationally and internationally with the final 20% and we have produced significant exits in Chicago, Baltimore, Paris, London and Las Vegas to name a few.\n Where we do invest outside of LA of course we bring all of our contacts and relationships to bear, which makes us a logical choice for any startup raising capital where having access to the biggest influencers, media companies, academic institutions and medical professionals can help propel the company\u2019s success.\n  It\u2019s true that some startup businesses have been impacted by this pandemic but as we\u2019re learning a few short months in, there has been much more acceleration of the trends leading toward technology growth that were already in place.\n Specifically addressing some LA-based companies we can share with you the trends we see directly with demand data:\n We already knew that telemedicine made sense for doctors and patients and now this trend has accelerated, regulations being lessened and cultural barriers overcome. We see a huge growth in food production and preservation (Apeel Sciences, for example) and food distribution (such as ChowNow). The need to reduce people in warehouses has propelled demand for robotics/automation for companies like inVia Robotics and the need for remote monitoring has helped LA-based DroneBase.", "posttime":

"note_en": "As co-workers began to get sick, essential worker Yudelka LaVigna took an unpaid leave of absence. When she got her unemployment benefits, she realized something unheard of: She was making more money not working.\n  &#34;That just kind of opens your eyes,&#34; says LaVigna, who&#39;s now back at her New York call center job for essential services.\n  When the government shut down the U.S. economy in a bid to tame the spread of the coronavirus, Congress scrambled to help tens of millions of people who lost jobs. The government rushed one-time relief checks to all families that qualified and tacked an extra $600 onto weekly unemployment benefits, which are usually less than regular pay and vary by state.\n  But so far, lawmakers have not passed any measure to increase pay for workers who were asked to keep going to work during a highly contagious health crisis. Some companies did create hazard, or &#34;hero,&#34; pay \u2014 typically around $2 extra an hour or a one-time bonus. Most have since  ended it.\n    So those boosted unemployment checks have created a bizarre distortion in the labor market, where holding on to a job doesn&#39;t guarantee being financially better off than losing one.\n     LaVigna says it&#39;s a weird imbalance. &#34;You feel like, you guys [the government] never have money for people that really need it, and all of a sudden you have money for everybody,&#34; she says. &#34;But then the people that are still essentially working don&#39;t get the recognition that they deserve.&#34;\n  Few employers have compensated extra for on-site work amid the health crisis. A  recent survey by the Economic Policy Institute found that fewer than a third of people who had to leave their homes to work during the pandemic received additional pay or benefits. As U.S. coronavirus cases persist and some states are even backtracking their reopening plans, workers have flooded social media with calls for hazard pay.\n  The Facebook group &#34;Give Essential Workers Essential Pay&#34; drew  nearly 4,000 members in a matter of weeks: cashiers and bus drivers, pharmacy technicians and sanitation workers, welders and machinists. They post pictures of the thank-you gifts their companies have sent them: hats, bracelets, T-shirts and gift cards.\n     &#34;We got videos from our employer saying thank you. We got musicians from the Grammys, or whatever, saying thank you. ... If we&#39;re so thanked and so important, why don&#39;t they write a bill for  us?&#34; says Nick Stone, an essential worker at a Nevada plant that supplies rock and other material for roadway, housing and other construction projects.\n  &#34;Think about the coal miners that go underground and risk their lives, and why their wages are increased compared to a surface miner,&#34; says Stone, a longtime miner. &#34;This pandemic was the same thing. We [essential workers] let everybody stay at home, and we put the country on our back to carry it. ... But we didn&#39;t choose to do this. This was asked of us.&#34;\n  Many social media conversations about hazard pay inevitably bring up the extra $600 weekly in unemployment benefits that workers wish they received too. It&#39;s a stark reminder of just how much of a difference that money can make to millions of working families.\n        Studies have begun to show that the additional pandemic aid threw a  critical lifeline to low-income households,  keeping many from poverty. It was easier to access compared with the typically onerous bureaucracy of U.S. safety-net programs. And experts who study poverty say that this money did a better job approximating a living wage than many minimum-wage jobs do.\n  &#34;All of a sudden when we actually want to help people, we think that $600 a week is the kind of amount that seems reasonable,&#34; says Liz Ananat, an economics professor at Barnard College, Columbia University. &#34;I was honestly astonished by $600 a week, because it was so generous compared to what I&#39;m used to looking at.&#34;\n  But the short-lived pandemic boost ends at the end of July.  Ananat&#39;s research also suggests that roughly half of those who&#39;ve lost work are still waiting for their unemployment checks. Many have no savings to fall back on.\n    &#34;I&#39;m not angry at anyone receiving that [unemployment]. I can&#39;t be angry, because you have to still feed your family,&#34; says Sandra Ellington, a custodial worker at the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport in Ohio.\n    Ellington knows the importance of her work \u2014 and she says she has found a way to commute to work and keep the airport clean as safely as possible.\n  But her life has changed. She&#39;s couponing more, because groceries have  gotten more expensive. And it has been months since she has hugged her mom, who&#39;s 70 and used to come over for a cup of coffee on the porch a few times a week, but had to stop. Ellington has seen her from the car while dropping off supplies. They say &#34;I love you&#34; to each other from a distance.\n  &#34;We&#39;ve worked through it all. ... We&#39;ve been there through the whole fight,&#34; Ellington says. &#34;We did not get the option [to stay home]. And I&#39;m not mad I didn&#39;t get that option. But I should be paid essential pay.&#34;\n    Lisa Cianci, a medical secretary near Boston, has been working 12-hour overnight shifts at an emergency room. On a recent call, her dad suggested she take a vacation because she sounded stressed.\n  &#34;I&#39;m psychologically, mentally, emotionally \u2014 I&#39;m like, spent,&#34; Cianci says. &#34;And I feel like I&#39;m not the same person.&#34;\n  She&#39;s hopeful that lawmakers will pass some kind of hazard pay for essential workers and finally come out and show that &#34;We haven&#39;t forgotten you.&#34;", "posttime": "2020-07-02 21:01:20", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5de5\u8d44,pay", "title":

"note_en": "This week, in a matter of just 48 hours, several social media companies made major changes to how their platforms are and can be used. Reddit  deleted a group, or \u201csubreddit\u201d, called \u201cThe Donald\u201d that was known for encouraging targeted harassment and hate speech. YouTube  banned videos from white supremacists like David Duke and Richard Spencer. And Facebook  cracked down on a wide swath of dangerous content, including groups devoted to the \u201cboogaloo\u201d movement, which hopes to spark a race war in the United States.\n These developments signal a significant shift in how these companies see their role and responsibility in the world. Until extremely recently their leaders repeatedly declared that \u201cfree speech\u201d was their primary value, and trumped other values like safety, dignity and democracy.\n Now, without declaring they had been wrong all along, these companies seem to have all decided it was time to declare a different way of dealing with dangerous, extremist content \u2013 at least on the surface. Why all this action, and why now?\n The first half of 2020 was a perfect storm of factors that made many of these companies reconsider how they want to represent themselves to the world and how they want to treat their users. The flood of misinformation about the Covid-19 pandemic endangered lives. The bold movements for social justice that rose up in the wake of the martyrdom of George Floyd heightened sensitivity and awareness of the dangers of white supremacy in the US like nothing else in recent years. And the re-election effort of Donald Trump has grown increasingly dangerous, with the president and his followers frequently deriding public health efforts and celebrating state and vigilante violence against Black people and their allies.\n In this environment, corporate leaders at Google, Twitter,  Facebook, Reddit and other companies had to take much more seriously the question of how they influence the world. Of course, social media scholars have been calling for this level of attention for almost a decade. Since around 2017, many journalists have, as well. But it took more than scholarship and journalism to make a difference.\n Companies as rich, powerful, and ubiquitous as Facebook and Google only have two real soft spots. One is labor. Both Google, which owns YouTube, and Facebook face a constant shortage of highly qualified and experienced workers. Many people who work for these companies have other employment options in ways that most American workers will never enjoy. Technology workers command high salaries and have unusual flexibility in their career plans and life choices. They are also in constant communication with each other, meaning that Silicon Valley workers, when they choose to, have a lot of power in terms of collective message-making. Recent months have seen  growing expressions of disgust among  workers at major tech companies who are frustrated at their companies\u2019 refusal to respond more assertively to problems with how their platforms are used. The CEOs and COOs of these companies are now, belatedly, realizing they have to take these concerns seriously.\n The other soft spot is advertising. Advertisers have even more power than workers. This week several major global advertisers, apparently led by Unilever,  announced that they are suspending advertising on Facebook until the company has stronger protocols against the use of its platform for hate speech and disinformation.\n Unilever may be one of the few institutions on earth that Facebook needs more than it needs Facebook. In fact, the consumer products conglomerate has a fairly strong record on matters of social responsibility. Yet it\u2019s been somewhat surprising when companies beyond the usual list of do-gooders step up to make a stand against racism and fascism.  Advertisers as powerful and diverse as Clorox, Ford, HP  and Adidas have decided that they do not want their products and logos associated with racism, calls to violence, or other trappings of emerging fascism in the United States. The number of boycotting companies has grown to more than 300, and even Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were  reportedly phoning their corporate friends to encourage them to stop advertising on Facebook.\n Why did it take so long, however, to get major tech companies to change their tune? Why weren\u2019t the leaders of Reddit,  YouTube and Facebook willing to take such steps in the aftermath of the 2017 genocide of the Rohingya minority in Myanmar? Why didn\u2019t they act in 2016, when Facebook actively supported the Trump campaign as the failed businessman pledged to build a wall to keep Mexicans out of the US and ban Muslim immigration? Why did it take the visual evidence of the killing of George Floyd and all of the fallout within just one country, the US, to move advertisers, labor and management to take such action? Didn\u2019t all the algorithmically stoked violence in Sri Lanka, India, Kenya, Myanmar and the Philippines matter?\n We shouldn\u2019t celebrate this moment. Let\u2019s mark it, instead, as a potential turning point in the history of Silicon Valley and its relationship with movements for global social justice, and try to understand its limitations. We still don\u2019t know to what extent these recent moves to de-platform extremism will make a difference over time.\n It\u2019s likely these advertisers will return to Facebook \u2013 still the best advertising platform ever created \u2013 after the US election in November. There is also a very good chance that the extremist actors who are pushing for violence and racism will just find a way to re-platform themselves under new aliases. Other social media services might help these movements promote themselves and generate not only wider audience participation, but also the sense of victimhood and indignation that is one of the chief drivers of fascism.\n So these moves could backfire or yield only marginal results over time. Nonetheless we should review the Great Deplatforming of 2020 as a potentially positive shift in the awareness of powerful people about the plight of the powerless and the rising forces of fascism in the United States.\n If only these companies, and the democracies they operate in, took the global threats more seriously. We still have much work to do.\n Siva Vaidhyanathan is a professor of Media Studies at the University of Virginia and the author of Antisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy", "posttime": "2020-07-02 21:00:23", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "facebook,\u79cd\u65cf\u4e3b\u4e49,reddit", "title": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48Reddit\u548cFacebook\u82b1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e48\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u624d\u5c4f\u853d\u79cd\u65cf\u4e3b\u4e49\u56e2\u4f53\uff1f", "title_en": "Why did it take so long for Reddit and Facebook to block racist groups?", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/02/reddit-youtube-facebook-block-racist-groups-why-did-it-take-so-long", "via": "", "real_tags": ["facebook", "\u79cd\u65cf\u4e3b\u4e49", "reddit"]}]
