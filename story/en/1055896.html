The police swapped tips on identifying pagan symbols. A company that sells toothpaste and soap had to deny, repeatedly, that it was acting as an agent of Satan.</p><p>Vigilante父母在幼儿园下挖了，寻找秘密隧道。警察交换了识别异教符号的提示。一家销售牙膏和肥皂的公司不得不反复否认它作为撒旦的代理人。</p><p> Early in the 1980s, baseless conspiracy theories about cults committing mass child abuse spread around the country. Talk shows and news programs fanned fears, and the authorities investigated hundreds of allegations. Even as cases slowly collapsed and skepticism prevailed, defendants went to prison, families were traumatized and millions of dollars were spent on prosecutions.</p><p> 在20世纪80年代的早期，关于邪教的毫无意义的谋取理论，犯了群众虐待全国各地的群众。谈话节目和新闻节目煽动恐惧，当局调查了数百个指控。即使在慢慢崩溃和怀疑的病例普遍存在的情况下，被告人被创伤了，家庭被创伤，并在起诉上花费了数百万美元。</p><p> The phenomenon was so sprawling that, in its aftermath, it took on several names, like the  ritual abuse scare or the  day care panic. But one name has increasingly stuck: the satanic panic.</p><p> 这种现象如此庞大，即在其后果中，它采用了几个名字，就像仪式滥用恐惧或日托恐慌一样。但一个名字越来越陷入困境：撒旦恐慌。</p><p> “The evidence wasn’t there, but the allegations of satanic ritual abuse never really went away,” said Ken Lanning, a former F.B.I. agent who worked on hundreds of abuse cases with the bureau’s behavioral science unit. “When people get emotionally involved in an issue, common sense and reason go out the window. People believe what they want and need to believe.”</p><p> “证据不在那里，但撒旦仪式滥用的指控从来没有真正消失过，”肯兰宁说，这是一个前任的F.I.曾在局部行为科学单位工作数百名滥用案件的经纪人。 “当人们在情绪上参与问题时，常识和理由出现窗外。人们相信他们想要的东西，需要相信。“</p><p>  When the book “Michelle Remembers” was published in 1980, introducing readers to a cast of murderous Canadian satanists, it landed on a powder keg of American anxieties, said Mary deYoung, a professor emeritus of sociology at Grand Valley State University.</p><p>  玛丽德耶尔州立大学社会学教授的教授德菲表示，当1980年出版的“米歇尔记得”发表给麦克酸加拿大人撒旦队的粉末粉粉，将读者降落在美国焦炭。</p><p> More women were going to work, by choice and necessity in the wake of the women’s rights movement and as the country struggled with a recession. Conservatism and the religious right were ascendant, and both emphasized the nuclear family. Good day care was hard to find, Ms. deYoung said, and many parents felt guilt for relying on it.</p><p> 在妇女权利运动之后，通过选择和必要性，更多的妇女将工作，因为该国陷入衰退。保守主义和宗教权利都是上升，两者都强调了核心家庭。 Deyoung女士说，好日子很难找到，很多父母都觉得依赖它有罪。</p><p> And after decades of denial, the public was starting to confront the problem of sexual abuse, especially involving children. “You hook all of those things together magically and boom — you’ve got the proper fuel for a moral panic,” she said.</p><p> 在几十年的否认之后，公众开始面临性虐待问题，特别是涉及儿童的问题。 “你神奇地把所有这些东西挂在一起，繁荣 - 你有一个道德恐慌的适当燃料，”她说。 </p><p> The spark, she said, was “Michelle Remembers,” a book by a Canadian psychologist and his former patient about her memories of child abuse at the hands of satanists. Although its lurid claims were quickly challenged, the book was a best seller. Suddenly, it seemed, terror could be lurking in any neighborhood.</p><p>她说，火花是“米歇尔记得”，一本加拿大心理学家和他前患者关于她对撒旦手中的儿童回忆的书。虽然其LURID声明迅速挑战，但这本书是一个畅销书。突然，似乎，恐怖可能会在任何邻居都潜伏。</p><p> The book gave people a villain to look for outside the family, said Sarah Marshall, a host of the history podcast “ You’re Wrong About.”What readers heard, she said, was, “Don’t look in the mirror, the call is not coming from inside the house — the satanists are the problem.”</p><p> 这本书给了人们一个恶棍寻找家庭外，莎拉马歇尔说，历史悠久的播客“你错了。”读者听到了什么，她说，“不要看镜子，呼叫不是来自房子里面 - 撒旦是问题。“</p><p> Some social workers and police officers, searching for an authority to help them face the problem of abuse, even adopted it as a training text, she said.</p><p> 她说，一些社会工作者和警察寻求帮助他们面临虐待问题的权力，甚至通过它作为培训案文。</p><p>  In the summer of 1983, a woman in Manhattan Beach, Calif., accused an employee at her son’s preschool, McMartin, of abusing him. The police sent a letter to about 200 families, asking for help with their investigation.</p><p>  在1983年夏天，加利福尼亚州曼哈顿海滩的一名妇女。，在她儿子的幼儿园，麦克风滥用他的员工。警方寄给了大约200个家庭的信，要求帮助他们调查。</p><p> “The following procedure is obviously an unpleasant one, but to protect the rights of your children as well as the rights of the accused, this inquiry is necessary,” the police chief wrote, describing alleged sex crimes. “Please question your child to see if he or she has been a witness to any crime or if she has been a victim.”</p><p> “以下手术显然是一个令人不快的手术，而是为了保护您的孩子的权利以及被告的权利，这项询问是必要的，”警察首席写道，描述所谓的性行为犯罪。 “请问你的孩子看他或她是否是任何犯罪的证人，或者她是受害者。”</p><p> The letter was “a model of what not to do,” said John Myers, a professor at the University of California, Hastings, and a lawyer who represents child victims of abuse.</p><p> 这封信是“不做的模型”，加州大学，黑斯廷斯和代表儿童受害者虐待儿童受害者的律师教授说。</p><p> The authorities also asked therapists to help interview hundreds of children. They questioned them for hours at a time, often asking leading and suggestive questions, he said. “We as professionals were singularly ill-equipped,” Mr. Myers said. “Nobody had thought about proper forensic interviews in these situations.”</p><p> 当局还要求治疗师帮助采访数百名儿童。他说，他们一次质疑他们几个小时的几个小时，往往会问领先和暗示的问题。 “我们作为专业人士的唯一虐待，”迈尔斯先生说。 “没有人想到了这些情况下的适当的法医面试。” </p><p> The allegations “didn’t move to full-blown satanism immediately,” said Richard Beck, the author of  a book about the panic. “The intermediary steps were people saying there was something weird or elaborate about what happened, and a fair number of those claims came out of the interviews.”</p><p>关于恐慌的书籍的作者Richard Beck说，指控“没有立即搬到全撒撒撒撒撒典”。 “中介步骤是人们说有一些奇怪或精心制定的事情，以及那些索赔的公平数量来自面试。”</p><p> In 1986, prosecutors charged seven employees with more than 100 counts of child molestation and conspiracy. A week later, they  dropped the charges against five defendants, citing weak evidence. All the defendants maintained their innocence.</p><p> 1986年，检察官收取七名员工，拥有100多名儿童骚扰和阴谋。一周后，他们对五名被告的指控造成了缺乏证据。所有被告都保持着纯真。</p><p> By then, the case was a national spectacle, and prosecutors pursued it despite growing doubts about the original accuser’s story and a variety of fantastical claims from interviews, including a “goatman,” bloody animal sacrifices, a school employee who could fly and acts of violence that left no physical trace. But the trial would not end for years, with no convictions, and prosecutors around the country started dozens of cases like it.</p><p> 届时，案件是一个国家景观，尽管对原始原则的故事和来自访谈的各种奇妙的索赔越来越多，但包括“山羊”的血腥动物牺牲，但可以飞行和行为的学校员工，所以追求这一目标暴力没有身体痕迹。但审判多年来不会结束，没有信念，而国内的检察官开始了这样的案件。</p><p> Each authority — the police, prosecutors, psychologists, the media — put pressure on the others to act, said Anna Merlan, the author of  a book on the history of conspiracy theories. “It was a very fervid environment,” she said. “Very credible-seeming people were saying: ‘Occult ritual abuse is all around you. We’ve seen it and the signs are visible if you know how to look for it.’”</p><p> 一本关于阴谋理论历史的作者，每个权威 - 警方，检察官，心理学家，媒体对其他人对别人施加压力，称为Anna Merlan。 “这是一个非常热情的环境，”她说。 “非常可靠的人看来：”隐匿的仪式虐待是你周围的。我们已经看到了它，如果你知道如何寻找它，那么标志很明显。“</p><p>  The authorities tried to make sense of the allegations. Mr. Lanning, the retired F.B.I. agent, said that as “a deluge” of calls about strange abuse began in 1983, he tried to investigate with an open mind. “My attitude was, yes, most anything is possible,” he said. “But where’s the evidence?”</p><p>  当局试图了解指控。 Lanning先生，退休的F.B.I.代理人表示，由于1983年开始致奇怪虐待的“洪岗”，他试图用开放的思想来调查。 “我的态度是，是的，大多数事情是可能的，”他说。 “但证据是哪里？”</p><p> So F.B.I. agents, police officers, lawyers and social workers gathered what they could, and shared their findings  at conferences and seminars. They handed out satanic calendars, traded  pamphlets about symbols like the “ cross of Nero” and the “horned hand,” and copied lists of supposed  occult organizations, which included  a collective of feminist astrologers in Minnesota.</p><p> 所以f.b.i.代理人，警察，律师和社会工作者聚集了他们所能，并在会议和研讨会上分享他们的调查结果。他们分发了撒旦日历，交易小册子关于符号的符号，如“Nero的十字架”和“有角手，”和被认为的隐匿组织的复制列表，其中包括在明尼苏达州的女性主义占星师的集体。</p><p> “A lot of this stuff was being disseminated by law enforcement without efforts to corroborate it,” Mr. Lanning said. “One cop would come up and say, ‘What a load of crap,’ but then another would say, ‘I’ve got to learn more!’”</p><p> 兰宁先生说：“执法不受法律执法的许多人的传播。” “一个警察会出现并说''垃圾的大多数是什么，'但另一个人会说，”我必须了解更多！“ </p><p> When Mr. Lanning asked officers how they corroborated information, their stories fell apart, he said. “Oh, I got it from so-and-so,” he recalled hearing. But often, he said, the pamphlets still made it into copy machines and onto the news.</p><p>当兰宁先生问官员他们如何证实信息，他们的故事分开，他说。 “哦，我从所以得到它，”他回忆道。但是，他说，小册子仍然把它变成了复制机器和新闻。</p><p>  In  May 1985, the news program “20/20” ran  a segment on Satan worship that described animal mutilations “clearly used in some kind of bizarre ritual,” rock music “associated with devil worship,” “satanic graffiti” and backward messages in pop songs.</p><p>  1985年5月，新闻节目“20/20”在撒旦崇拜上运行了一个细分的撒旦崇拜，“清楚地用于某种奇怪的仪式”清楚地用“岩石音乐”，“撒旦涂鸦”和落后的消息流行歌曲。</p><p> There were a few caveats. The host, Hugh Downs, opened by saying: “Police have been skeptical when investigating these acts, just as we are in reporting them. But there is no question that something is going on out there, and that’s sufficient reason for ‘20/20’ to look into it.”</p><p> 有一些警告。主持人，休跌，通过说：“在调查这些行为时，警方一直持怀疑态度，就像我们在报告那样。但是，毫无疑问，有些东西在那里发生，这是'20/20'的充分理由看它。“</p><p> The program presented cult activity, if not the occult itself, in all but certain terms. “Today we have found Satan is alive and thriving, or at least plenty of people believe he is,” said the correspondent Tom Jarriel. “His followers are extremely secretive but found in all walks of life.” Only near the end of the report did he say that, until evidence was proved, “the link between crime and satanic cults will remain speculative.”</p><p> 该计划提出了邪教活动，如果不是隐匿本身，但在某些条款中。 “今天我们发现撒旦是活着的，蓬勃发展，或者至少有很多人相信他是，”汤姆·贾里尔说。 “他的追随者非常秘密，但在各行各业都有发现。”只有在报告结束时他说，直到证明证据，“犯罪和撒旦邪教之间的联系将保持投机。”</p><p> Three years later, NBC  commissioned its own special, hosted by Geraldo Rivera, who described gruesome crimes, aired child testimony of abuse and interviewed Ozzy Osbourne. Almost 20 million homes tuned in.</p><p> 三年后，NBC委托其特殊的，由Gersdo Rivera主持，他描述了令人毛骨悚然的罪行，播出了虐待儿童证词和采访了Ozzy Osbourne。近2000万房屋调整。</p><p>  In April 1985, thousands of curious, angry and confused customers were calling the corporate giant Procter &amp; Gamble about leaflets that accused it of using its profits from household goods to support devil worship.</p><p>  1985年4月，数千名好奇，愤怒和困惑的客户致电公司巨人宝贵者＆amp;赌博关于将其利用家居用品的利润为支持魔鬼崇拜的传单。</p><p> “They simply are not true,” W. Wallace Abbott, a senior vice president said  at a news conference. “We haven’t the vaguest idea how it started; all we know is people are believing it. Do you know how hard it is to fight a rumor?”</p><p> “一位高级副总裁W.Warlace Abbott在新闻发布会上表示，”他们根本不是真的。 “我们没有模糊的想法它是如何开始的;我们所知道的是人们相信它。你知道打谣言是多么努力？“ </p><p> False rumors had started years earlier, many claiming that its logo, of a bearded man in the moon facing 13 stars, was actually a symbol of the devil. (The logo dated to 1882 and the stars referred to the 13 original colonies.) The company began a two-decade campaign to defend its name,  sending representatives to churches,  filing lawsuits and pursuing court cases  as recently as 2007. It also  changed its logo.</p><p>错误的谣言已经开始多年前，许多人声称它的徽标，在月球上的一个有胡子的人面向13颗星，实际上是魔鬼的象征。 （徽标日期为1882年，星星提到了13个原始殖民地。）公司开始捍卫其名称的两十年的运动，向教会派遣代表，提交诉讼和追求法院案件，最近担任2007年。它也改变了它标识。</p><p>  In 1990, a jury acquitted the McMartin Preschool defendants on some charges and deadlocked on others, saying it was impossible to determine the truth from the children’s testimony. A second prosecution  ended in a mistrial. Prosecutors, having spent $15 million, dropped the case.</p><p>  1990年，陪审团在一些指控上释放了McMartin学龄前被告，并对他人僵持，说不可能从儿童证词中确定真相。第二次检察机关遭到误解。检察官花了1500万美元，掉了案件。</p><p> Nearly 200 people were charged with crimes over the course of the satanic panic, and dozens were convicted. Many defendants were eventually freed, sometimes  after years. Three Arkansas teenagers who became known as the West Memphis Three were  freed in 2011, almost 20 years after they were convicted of murders that prosecutors portrayed as a satanic sacrifice. In 2013, a Texas couple were  released after 21 years in prison; they were later  awarded $3.4 million from a state fund for wrongful convictions.</p><p> 在撒旦恐慌过程中犯下了近200人，数十岁是被定罪的。许多被告最终被释放，有时候是多年的。被称为西孟菲斯的三名阿肯色州青少年在2011年被释放，近20年被判谋杀谋杀者被判谋杀者被定罪，因为检察官被描绘为撒旦牺牲。 2013年，德克萨斯夫妇在监狱21年后发布;他们后来奖励了来自国家基金的340万美元以非法定罪。</p><p> In 1992, Mr. Lanning, the F.B.I. agent,  released an investigative guide that explained his skepticism of satanic abuse claims. Two years later, researchers with the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect found that investigators  could not substantiate any of roughly 12,000 accusations of group cult sexual abuse based on satanic ritual.</p><p> 1992年，Lanning先生，F.B.I.代理人发布了一项调查指南，解释了他对撒旦滥用索赔的怀疑。两年后，研究人员与国家虐待和忽视的侵犯中心发现，根据撒旦仪式，调查人员不能证实大约12,000个邪教性虐待的指责。</p><p> In a few instances, apologies followed,  including from Mr. Rivera and Kyle Zirpolo, one of the former McMartin students who made allegations to the police. “I lied,” he  told The Los Angeles Times. “It was an ordeal. I remember thinking to myself, ‘I’m not going to get out of here unless I tell them what they want to hear.’”</p><p> 在一些情况下，道歉，包括来自Rivera和Kyle Zirpolo先生，其中一名前麦克马丁学生之一向警方提出了指控。 “我撒了谎，”他告诉洛杉矶时报。 “这是一个尊重。我记得思考自己，除非我告诉他们他们想听到的东西，否则我不会离开这里。“ </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/us/satanic-panic.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/us/satanic-panic.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/重温/">#重温</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/revisit/">#revisit</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/虐待/">#虐待</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
