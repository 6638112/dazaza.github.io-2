The software engineer and San Diego native initiated the trade-in with Apple through the Apple Store mobile app, where he was quoted $350 for his used laptop. He felt it was in pretty good condition, with no apparent damage to the case and a fully functioning display and keyboard. So McGloin packed up the device and shipped it in, expecting to receive his money in the coming weeks, which would help offset his purchase of a MacBook Air carrying Apple’s new M1 chip.</p><p>当Daniel McGloin在今年2月决定在2017年2月的2017年苹果MacBook中进行交易时，跳到主要内容，他以为他得到了一个非常好的交易。软件工程师和圣地亚哥本机通过Apple Store Mobile App启动了Apple的贸易，其中他被用350美元用于他使用的笔记本电脑。他觉得它状况良好，对案例没有明显的损坏以及全运作的显示和键盘。因此，McGloin将设备包装起来并在未来几周内收到他的资金，这将有助于抵消他购买携带Apple新的M1芯片的MacBook Air。</p><p> The situation soon changed after his laptop arrived for inspection. Suddenly, McGloin was told his MacBook was worth just $140, less than half what Apple originally quoted. The mysterious culprit: “display has 3 or more white spots,” the Apple Store app told him. It’s a defect McGloin doesn’t remember ever seeing, and one that he should have noticed: typically, white spots on an LCD display are evidence of serious damage or burn-in and are clearly visible. In McGloin’s estimation, however, the laptop was in “excellent” condition, he tells  The Verge, and he didn’t see any white spots when he packed it up.</p><p> 他的笔记本电脑到达检查后很快就会发生变化。突然，麦格洛因被告知他的MacBook只值140美元，不到一半的苹果最初引用的东西。神秘的罪魁祸首：“展示有3个或更多的白点”，Apple Store App告诉他。这是一个缺陷的麦格林，不记得看过，他应该注意到：通常，液晶显示屏上的白色斑点是严重损坏或燃烧的证据，清晰可见。然而，在麦格林的估计中，笔记本电脑处于“优秀的”条件，他讲述了边缘，他没有看到他包装它的白色斑点。</p><p> So McGloin decided to search around online, where he discovered a lesser-known fact about Apple’s trade-in program. The company he had been dealing with was not actually Apple, but an Atlanta-based contractor named Phobio. Founded in 2010, Phobio is an enterprise service provider that specializes in offering white label trade-in services other companies can pass off as their own.</p><p> 因此，McGloin决定在线搜索，他发现了关于Apple的贸易计划的鲜为人知的事实。他一直在处理的公司实际上并不是苹果，而是一个亚特兰大的承包商命名为Phobio。 Phobio成立于2010年，是一家企业服务提供商，专门为其他公司提供白色标签的商品服务提供商。</p><p> McGloin also found Phobio had a pretty questionable online reputation when it came to Apple products.</p><p> McGloin还发现Phobio在苹果产品中有一个非常有问题的在线声誉。</p><p>   “It’s here I realized that number one, the trade-in program is not run by Apple, number two, there are lots of people observing the same behavior, and number three, this seems to be a new development in the last few months,” McGloin says.</p><p>   “它在这里我意识到第一个，贸易计划不是由苹果经营的，有很多人观察同样的行为，而第三名，这似乎是过去几个月的新发展， “麦格林说。</p><p> The Verge inspected McGloin’s MacBook in person after he rejected the trade-in offer and Phobio returned the computer to him. We could detect no such white spots or any discernible damage whatsoever. The laptop booted up and operates like new, and it has since passed numerous online diagnostic tests.</p><p> 在拒绝商品优惠和Phobio将电脑送回他之后，缅甸在人们中检查了McGloin的MacBook。我们可以检测到任何这样的白色斑点或任何可辨别的损坏。笔记本电脑启动并像新的一样运行，它已经通过了许多在线诊断测试。</p><p> It’s not clear why McGloin’s estimate was halved. But his experience is indicative of a common belief that’s emerged about Phobio online — that the company stiffs owners of Apple products out of hundreds of dollars in trade-in value — and the supposed “3 or more white spots” defect seems unlikely enough that it bears investigation.</p><p> 目前尚不清楚为什么麦格林的估计减半。但他的经验表明，普通的普通话 - 在网上出现了一个普遍的信念 - 即该公司在数百美元的贸易价值中僵硬的苹果产品的所有者 - 以及所谓的“3或更多白点”缺陷似乎不太可能熊调查。 </p><p> Two other people who spoke with  The Verge and provided documentation of their Phobio trade-in processes also experienced a similar situation, in which “white spots” or other supposed defects, only detected after the device was shipped to a Phobio facility, resulted in reduced trade-in quotes. And that’s just a tiny sample of an online torrent of complaints against Phobio and its practices across multiple types of gadgets and with an alarming uptick in the last few months.</p><p>与边缘的另外两个人谈到并提供了他们的Phobio贸易过程的文档也经历了类似的情况，其中“白斑”或其他假想的缺陷只在设备被运送到Phobio设施后，导致减少贸易报价。这只是针对Phobio的在线竞争的一个小型样本及其在多种类型的小工具上的实践以及过去几个月的令人震惊的上升。</p><p>  “Having used it for three years, I can tell you I never noticed a problem,” Carlos Pero, another Apple customer who had their laptop trade-in quote reduced by Phobio from $640 to $210, tells  The Verge. Pero also asked for his laptop back, and Phobio returned it. Upon inspection, Pero could not detect any issues with his computer, and he showed us a video of his MacBook Pro booting up to verify there were no “white spots” present. “Maybe they have some diagnostic tool? But from a consumer perspective, no way I see a problem before I sent it or after receiving it back.”</p><p>  “用它三年来，我可以告诉你我从未注意到一个问题，”卡洛斯佩罗，另一个苹果客户，他们的笔记本电脑的贸易速度由Phobio从640美元降至210美元，讲述了。佩罗还要求他的笔记本电脑回来，而Phobio返回它。检查后，佩罗无法检测到他的电脑的任何问题，他向我们展示了他的MacBook Pro的视频，以验证存在的“白色点”。 “也许他们有一些诊断工具？但从消费者的角度来看，在我发送它之前或收到后，我没有办法发现问题。“</p><p> Pero says he was never given any photographic proof of the white spots when his trade-in was adjusted. “They sent no such thing. Just the notification of the change in value and essentially the take-it-or-leave-it message which came by way of Apple,” he says. “I imagine it would be a tougher choice for someone who was counting on realizing the full value of the trade-in, who may not be able to afford a new computer otherwise.”</p><p> 佩罗说，当调整他的商品时，他从未给出任何白色斑点的照片证明。 “他们没有发这样的东西。只是对价值变化的通知，基本上是由Apple来到的采取IT或休假IT消息，“他说。 “我想到了对那些指望实现商品的全部价值的人来说，这将是一个更强硬的选择，否则可能无法负担新电脑。”</p><p> Scores of other instances of this exact situation happening to Apple product owners can be found online, too, with numerous customers citing Phobio’s “3 or more white spots” explanation as the reason for their adjusted trade-in, as well as stories of other types of apparent damage detected only after sending a device in for inspection. This isn’t just restricted to MacBooks, either. Customers often complain of reduced trade-in quotes for iPhones, iPads, and iMacs, too.</p><p> 此类确切情况发生在苹果产品所有者上的其他情况也可以在网上找到，众多客户引用了Phobio的“3个或更多白点”解释，作为调整后的贸易的原因，以及其他类型的故事仅在发送设备进行检查后才检测到表观损坏。这也不限于MacBooks。客户通常也抱怨iPhone，iPads和imacs的减少的贸易报价。</p><p> In some cases, like McGloin’s, Phobio’s name never comes up, so customers are left with the impression Apple inspected it and reduced their quote accordingly. “The only real ‘correspondence’ I had with Apple and Phobio were the interactions in the Apple Store app. I didn’t otherwise contact them through email or phone,” McGloin says. He tells us he was faced with the tough decision to either accept less than half the promised money or try to sell his computer elsewhere after going through the hassle of wiping it clean and shipping it. “I’m actually a pretty big Apple fan, but this feels off-brand and pretty shady,” he says.</p><p> 在某些情况下，就像麦格林一样，Phobio的名字永远不会出现，所以客户留下了印象苹果，并相应地减少了Quote。 “我与Apple和Phobio的唯一真正的”函数“是Apple Store应用程序的互动。我没有通过电子邮件或电话联系他们，“麦格林说。他告诉我们，他面临着艰难的决定，以接受不到一半的承诺金钱，或者试图在擦拭干净和运送它的麻烦之后在其他地方卖掉他的电脑。 “我真的是一个非常大的苹果粉丝，但这感觉到品牌和漂亮的阴凉，”他说。</p><p>  Apple often prides itself on customer service and in handling many of its sales operations in-house. So the use of a third-party vendor not advertised publicly on its  trade-in website — even in receipts, Apple only refers to an unnamed “trade-in partner” — is a peculiar approach for the iPhone maker.</p><p>  Apple经常以客户服务为荣，并在内部处理许多销售业务。因此，即使在收据中，甚至在收到的网站上使用公开宣传的第三方供应商也是指未命名的“交易合作伙伴” - 是iPhone制造商的特殊方法。</p><p> Outsourcing trade-ins is common in the industry, though. Many businesses pick white-label inspection and recycling firms to cut costs and avoid the hassle of managing a cumbersome operation. Phobio also happens to be the  trade-in partner of OnePlus in the US, and the firm also  inked a deal with Amazon Canada just last month to handle trade-ins of “certain eligible mobile phones, laptops, iPads and Apple watches.” It handles trade-ins for Costco and B&amp;H Photo, too.</p><p> 不过，外包商品在行业中很常见。许多企业挑选白标检验和回收公司以削减成本，避免管理繁琐的操作的麻烦。 Phobio也恰好是美国Oneplus的贸易伙伴，该公司在上个月上还与亚马逊加拿大造成了谈判，以处理“某些合格的手机，笔记本电脑，iPad和Apple手表”的商品。它也处理Costco和B＆amp; H照片的商品。 </p><p> Yet for Apple, which stakes its reputation on quality control, the negative experiences customers report having with Phobio threaten to undermine the image Apple has cultivated as a customer-obsessed product company, which, in turn, helps justify the company’s high-priced consumer tech.</p><p>然而，对于苹果公司对质量控制的声誉，负面体验的负面体验报告的客户有可能破坏图像苹果的植物已经培养为客户痴迷的产品公司，这反过来又帮助了公司的高价消费技术。</p><p> Apple tells us Phobio is not the only company that helps manage its US trade-in program, but it wouldn’t name any others — and we verified that every type of product you’d trade in at Apple.com (computers, phones, tablets, and watches) is currently handled by Phobio in the United States. Apple also has a trade-in partner named Brightstar servicing Canada and other parts of the globe, but two Brightstar employees told us it no longer accepts US trade-ins. One referred us to Phobio specifically.</p><p> Apple告诉我们Phobio不是唯一有助于管理其美国贸易方案的公司，但它不会命名任何其他公司 - 我们核实您在Apple.com上交易的每种类型的产品（电脑，手机，平板电脑和手表目前由美国的Phobio处理。 Apple还有一个名为Brightstar的贸易伙伴，提供加拿大和地球的其他地区，但两个Brightstar员工告诉我们，它不再接受美国商品。一个人特别引用了我们的Phobio。</p><p> A  podcast interview with Phobio founder and CEO Stephen Wakeling in 2018 includes vague details on the partnership. At one point, Wakeling tells the podcast host he’s not sure Apple would permit him to talk further about the program. Some  news posts and  forum threads as far back as 2017 mention Phobio as Apple’s trade-in partner, but it’s not clear how long the two have been in business; Apple first began  accepting used iPhones at its retail stores in 2013, and the Apple trade-in program has since expanded to include close to its full lineup of hardware products.</p><p> 2018年在2018年与Phobio创始人和首席执行官斯蒂芬瓦格的播客采访包括伙伴关系的模糊细节。在一点，瓦格林告诉播客主机他不确定苹果允许他谈论该计划。一些新闻帖子和论坛线程在2017年提及Phobio作为Apple的贸易伙伴，但这并不清楚两人在业务中多久了; Apple首次在2013年零售店接受使用的iPhone，并且Apple贸易计划已扩大以包括靠近其完整的硬件产品阵容。</p><p> It’s not like customers could just walk into an Apple Store to avoid Phobio, at least not where laptops are concerned. Up until  last summer, Mac trade-ins, unlike with iPhones or iPads, were not eligible for in-store inspections by Apple employees at the company’s retail locations. Macs had to be sent in the mail, where Apple’s trade-in partner Phobio steps in. (Due to COVID-19 store closures and limitations on in-store services, it’s likely many customers have kept using the mail-in service for Macs.)</p><p> 它不像客户可以走进Apple商店以避免Phobio，至少不是膝上型电脑所关注的地方。直到去年夏天，与iPhone或iPad不同，Mac Orce-ins与公司员工的零售地点不符合苹果雇员的店内检查。 MAC必须在邮件中发送，其中Apple的贸易伙伴Phobio步骤。（由于Covid-19商店关闭和储存服务的限制，它可能很多客户都保留了对Mac的邮件服务。 ）</p><p> And even a cursory Google search on Phobio and its handling of Apple trade-ins returns  dozens  upon  dozens of  message  board  threads detailing bad experiences and a  Better Business Bureau page with more than 500 complaints and new entries added almost every day. Many of these complaints are recent, and some are from Apple customers wondering openly if they’ve been a victim of some type of fraud or whether Phobio is a legitimate company.</p><p> 甚至奇迹谷歌在Phobio上搜索的谷歌谷歌和苹果商品的处理返回数十个留言板线程，详细介绍了不良体验的差别和更好的商业局页面，几乎每天都有500个投诉和新条目。其中许多投诉是最近的，有些人来自苹果客户，如果他们是某种类型的欺诈的受害者，或者Phobio是一个合法的公司，他们是一个公开的。</p><p> When some customers complained, they reported Phobio’s provided proof  consisted of grainy images that  didn’t show clear-cut evidence. Some customers have  detailed how they took photos of their devices prior to shipping them in in the event of disputes, only for Phobio to return photographic evidence they say either  doesn’t illustrate the alleged issue or is too low-quality or obfuscating to serve as proper proof.</p><p> 当一些客户抱怨时，他们报告了P​​hobio提供的证据包括没有显示清除证据的颗粒状图像。一些客户详细介绍了他们在在争议发货之前将他们的设备照片的照片拍摄，只有Phobio返回摄影证据，他们说无论是说明所谓的问题还是太低或恶意地服用正确证明。</p><p> 2/ So on with them now, it turns out they use &#34;trusted partners&#34; to do fulfillment on the trade-ins. So the outsourced company can I guess either break it or report damage to stiff you on the price.</p><p> 2 /依此一身的目的，事实证明他们使用了＆＃34;值得信赖的伙伴＆＃34;履行商品履行。因此，外包公司可以猜测要么打破它或报告伤害，以僵硬地僵硬。 </p><p>— Josh Marshall (@joshtpm)  December 22, 2020</p><p>-  Josh Marshall（@Joshtpm）2020年12月22日</p><p> “Your trade-in value has changed.” I don’t remember white spots but that’s not the damage I made.

Phobio, which is at that point in possession of the device, then offers the customer the option to accept the reduced quote or ask for the product to be shipped back. (Phobio does offer to ship the product both ways for free.)</p><p> 关于Phobio的大量投诉有一个共同的主题：MacBook或iPhone似乎处于完美的工作状态，仅针对设备以后的设备具有无法解释的缺陷。 Phobio，它在该设备中的那个点，然后为客户提供接受减少报价的选项或要求将产品送回回来。 （Phobio确实提供免费发货产品。）</p><p> This presents a thorny set of choices for a device owner, primarily by seeding self-doubt as to the real value of the product they’re hoping to trade in and what their best option might be. What if the product did have the damage beforehand and they simply didn’t notice or perhaps something happened during transit? Maybe Phobio is using a proprietary diagnostic tool that reveals something no consumer could ever find on their own? What if, by some stroke of bad luck, the device was somehow damaged during transit, and you’d have a hard time using it or selling it somewhere else if you ask for it back?</p><p> 这为设备所有者提供了一套棘手的选择，主要是通过播种自我怀疑，以及他们希望交易的产品的实际价值以及他们最佳选择可能是什么。如果产品事先有伤害，他们根本没有注意到或可能在运输过程中发生的事情？也许Phobio正在使用专有的诊断工具，揭示一个没有消费者可以自己找到的东西？如果是运气不良的行程，那么在运输过程中，该设备在某种程度上损坏了，如果你要求它，你会有很难使用的时间或在其他地方卖掉它？ </p><p> Pretty disappointed in Apple’s trade in vendor. Trade in value dropped from $490 to $180 after “three white spots” magically appeared on my old MBP while in transit. Certainly feels like bait and switch on that one.</p><p>对苹果在供应商的贸易感到失望。在“三个白色斑点”在运输过程中，贸易价值从490美元到180美元下降到180美元。当然感觉就像诱饵和开关那个。</p><p>— Rob Zimmerman (@taintedzodiac)  December 23, 2020</p><p> -  Rob Zimmerman（@taintedzodio）2020年12月23日</p><p> Chris Dwan calls his experience with Phobio a “pretty straightforward bait and switch,” telling  The Verge that he mailed in his MacBook Air with an expected trade-in value of $370, only for it to be knocked down to $150 for damage to the outer shell he suspects happened during transit or inspection. “At that point it was take-it-or-leave-it. They did offer to ship the laptop back, but I caved and took my $150.”</p><p> Chris Dwan通过Phobio A“非常简单的诱饵和交换机”来呼召他的经验，告诉他在他的MacBook Air中邮寄，预期的折价为370美元，只能被击倒到150美元的损坏他怀疑的炮弹发生在过境或检查期间。 “在那一点上，它是一个或留下的。他们确实提供了向膝上型计算机发货，但我陷入困境并拿走了150美元。“</p><p> “At that point it was take-it-or-leave-it. They did offer to ship the laptop back, but I caved and took my $150.”</p><p> “在那一点上，它是一个或留下的。他们确实提供了向膝上型计算机发货，但我陷入困境并拿走了150美元。“</p><p> At the end of the day, someone trading in their used Apple device is looking to get rid of it and hoping they’ll get a little cash for their trouble, instead of simply recycling it or leaving it to collect dust. That could make them easy to take advantage of: many are likely willing to take what they can get, rather than spend additional time and energy trying to get satisfaction from a company that’s holding all the cards, particularly when it’s not clear who’s to blame or whether their product is actually damaged.</p><p> 在一天结束时，在他们使用过的Apple设备上交易正在寻求摆脱它并希望他们能够为他们的麻烦获得一点现金，而不是简单地回收它或让它收集灰尘。这可能让他们轻松利用：许多人可能愿意采取他们可以得到的东西，而不是花费额外的时间和精力试图从一个拿着所有卡片的公司那里得到满足，特别是当它不清楚谁应该责备或者他们的产品是否实际上损坏了。</p><p> “White spots” or no, it’s not surprising that a company like Phobio would be facing loads of complaints. Every company working in customer service is likely to have its fair share of disgruntled customers complaining online; people with positive experiences tend to have little reason to share those stories with the world. Trade-in programs can involve especially fraught negotiations because of the money involved and the fear customers harbor of being scammed. Even rightful adjustments to trade-in quotes might inspire someone to leave a negative review or feel as if they’ve been had.</p><p> “白点”或不，这并不奇怪，像Phobio这样的公司将面临着抱怨的大量。在客户服务中工作的每家公司都有可能占据在线抱怨的不良客户的公平份额;积极经历的人往往有理由与世界分享这些故事。由于所涉及的资金和被骗的恐惧顾客涉及涉及的资金，贸易计划可能涉及尤其令人兴奋的谈判。甚至对贸易报价的正确调整可能会激励某人留下否定审查或感觉就像他们已经过。</p><p> So upset at  @Apple. I traded in my watch, which was in perfect working conditions and no screen issues. They now saw it had white spots. That isn’t true. I have pictures of it before packing it. So mad!!</p><p> 在@apple时感到沮丧。我在我的手表中交易，这是完美的工作条件，没有筛选问题。他们现在看到它有白色斑点。这不是真的。在包装之前，我有它的照片。疯了！ </p><p>— Mari (@Busyspider23)  October 7, 2020</p><p>-  Mari（@ Busyspider23）2020年10月7日</p><p> In fact, many people have reported positive experiences with Phobio — many never realizing they weren’t dealing with Apple directly. One  Verge staffer says they were even given more money for an Apple trade-in after the device exceeded the quality estimate they were initially quoted on.</p><p> 事实上，很多人都报告了与Phobio的积极经历 - 许多人从未意识到他们没有直接与Apple打交道。一位缅甸员工表示，在设备超出了它们最初引用的质量估计后，他们甚至给了更多的苹果商品资金。</p><p> Phobio customer service representatives can also be seen replying to almost every single tweet, tagging the company’s support account, and Better Business Bureau post, asking how to remedy the situation. In the latter cases, many of the customers who complained post to the bureau’s website after the fact saying Phobio resolved their issues with fixed trade-in values or Apple Store gift cards to make up the difference.</p><p> Phobio客户服务代表也可以看出回复几乎每一个推文，标记公司的支持账户，更好的商业局邮政，要求如何纠正这种情况。在后一种情况下，许多抱怨局向局网站申请的客户在事实上说明了Phobio解决了固定的贸易价值观或Apple商店礼品卡的问题，以弥补差异。</p><p> In a tour of one of its so-called aggregation facilities  posted to LinkedIn last month, a Phobio representative shed some light on how Apple products are evaluated. “We have very simple grading criteria. We only have two of course, which is working and damaged to make it easy for folks at home to grade their own devices,” the representative explains, before transitioning to a Phobio employee inspecting a MacBook. “He’s making sure the screen is intact and functional, he’s making sure the keys function, and then he’s checking to see if there’s any wear or tear to the computer or any major dents or damage.”</p><p> 在上个月张贴到Linkedin的一个所谓的聚合设施之一，掌握了苹果产品的评估方式。 “我们有很简单的分级标准。我们当然只有两种，它正在工作和损坏，使其在家里的人们易于为自己的设备奠定“代表”解释说，在过渡到检测MacBook的Phobio雇员之前。 “他确保屏幕完整而实用，他确保钥匙函数，然后他正在检查电脑或任何主要凹痕或损坏是否有任何磨损或撕裂。”</p><p>  “A couple of other things to look out for: LCD damage, screen spotting and dead pixels, cracked screen, missing or malfunctioning buttons, and large dents,” the representative says. When asked by Wakeling, Phobio’s CEO who appears on-screen at the beginning and end of the video, what the top issues are with devices sent in for trade-in, the representative simply says “screen delamination” or “any major damage” to the device.</p><p>  “一些其他东西要注意：液晶损坏，屏幕斑点和死亡像素，裂缝屏幕，缺失或故障按钮，以及大凹痕，”代表说。当Wakeling询问时，Phobio的首席执行官在视频的开头和结束时出现在屏幕上，顶级问题在商品中发送的设备是什么，代表简单地说“屏幕分层”或“任何重大损害”装置。</p><p> In a Phobio  inspection guideline document posted online for business trade-ins (which may have different standards than consumer trade-ins), the company details its processes for inspecting products like iPhones and Macs. Under the display portion, the document says “a device is considered ‘Damaged’ if the display: is cracked, fractured and/or shows signs of delamination; does not function as designed (displaying single colors, lines, flickering); is scratched such that it affects readability.”</p><p> 在Phobio检验指南文件中，在线发布商业贸易职务（可能具有不同的标准而非消费者商品贸易），该公司详细介绍了其检测像iPhone和Mac等产品的流程。在显示部分下，如果显示器：被破裂，破裂和/或显示分层的迹象，文档说明“设备被认为是”损坏“;不起作用（显示单一颜色，线路，闪烁）;被划伤，使其影响可读性。“</p><p> However, no mention of white spots can be found in the document, nor did Phobio mention that issue in its facility tour.</p><p> 但是，在文件中找不到白斑，Phobio在其设施巡回演出中也提到了这一问题。 </p><p>   You could chalk up these bad customer experiences with Phobio to the sheer volume of products Apple’s trade-in program likely deals in or discrepancies in the level of diligence of its individual employees. But that doesn’t explain the mystery of the white spots, and why we’ve seen perfectly functional MacBook computers have their trade-in value cut in half — or more.</p><p>您可以用Phobio粉化这些不良客户体验，以纯粹的产品批量批量批量批量在其个别员工的勤勉程度上达成或差异。但这并没有解释白斑的谜团，为什么我们看到完美的职业MacBook电脑的折叠成绩为一半或更多。</p><p> What we do know about the white spots scenario is that it typically involves an Apple laptop in seemingly good condition quoted at one price, only for the trade-in estimate to be knocked down by more than 50 percent upon inspection. The common response from Phobio is that the display suffers from “3 or more white spots.” In McGloin’s case, these apparent spots were not detectable by a human eye before or after Phobio inspected the device. It doesn’t add up.</p><p> 我们对白点情景所知的是，它通常涉及一个价格在一个价格上的良好状态中的苹果笔记本电脑，仅在检查时估计的折扣估计超过50％。 Phobio的共同响应是显示屏遭受了“3个或更多白点”。在麦格林的情况下，这些表观斑点在Phobio检查装置之前或之后，人眼无法检测到。它没有加起来。</p><p> So we felt it necessary to ask Phobio if they had a reasonable explanation for cases like these that went beyond the standard “screen spotting,” “dead pixels,” and other general LCD damage that would be perceptible by looking at the screen yourself.</p><p> 因此，如果他们对如此超出标准“屏幕发现，”死像素“和其他一般液晶损坏的情况，我们觉得有必要向Phobio提出合理的解释，这是通过看屏幕来察觉。</p><p> We struggled to find any form of contact information for Phobio’s public relations department</p><p> 我们努力找到Phobio公共关系部门的任何形式的联系方式</p><p> Phobio did not have a media contact line or any other form of public-facing public relations department we were able to locate for this story. We did, however, contact a third-party PR representative for Phobio, who forwarded our questions to the company. We repeatedly asked for the opportunity to speak on the record with an official Phobio representative about our findings, but we were ultimately denied. We instead sent a series of questions.</p><p> Phobio没有媒体联系线或任何其他形式的公共关系部门我们能够找到这个故事。但是，我们确实与向该公司转发的Phobio的第三方公关代表联系了Phobio。我们多次要求有机会与官方的Phobio代表有关我们的调查结果，但我们最终被否认。我们派出了一系列问题。</p><p> Phobio would not comment directly on the white spots issue, and it would not offer an explanation as to what tools it uses to evaluate MacBook displays or why it seems some customers have had their trade-in quotes adjusted because of the alleged white spots.</p><p> Phobio不会直接在白斑问题上发表评论，它不会发出用于评估MacBook显示的工具的解释，或者为什么它似乎有些客户似乎有他们的贸易引用调整，因为所谓的白色斑点。</p><p> When asked, Phobio would not say how long it’s been Apple’s trade-in partner or if it is Apple’s only US trade-in partner, and the company would not comment on the financial terms of its contract, including whether Phobio or Apple gets to keep and resell the devices customers send in. Phobio would also not say whether it receives any guidance from Apple on how to inspect products and make adjustments to trade-in quotes.</p><p> 当被问到时，Phobio不会说苹果公司的贸易伙伴是多久，或者是苹果公司唯一的贸易合作伙伴，而公司不会评论其合同的财务条款，包括Phobio或Apple是否能够保持保留并转售客户客户发送的设备。Phobio也不会说它是否从Apple接收了如何检查产品的任何指导，并对商品引用进行调整。 </p><p> Phobio would also not tell us how frequently it negatively adjusted Apple trade-in quotes by up to or more than half. It would also not say how often customers accept these lowered adjustments versus rejecting them and asking for the product back.</p><p>Phobio也不会告诉我们它经常调整苹果贸易的频率，高达一半以上。它还不会说客户接受这些降低的调整的频率与拒绝它们并询问产品。</p><p>  We carefully assess each device sent to us, and only change the initial quote if the device we receive or its condition differs from what was initially indicated by the customer. We document our findings at every step of the way with photos that are shared with the customers. The customer can then agree to the revised quote, or if they do not, we express ship it back to them at our expense.</p><p>  我们仔细评估发送给我们的每个设备，只有我们收到的设备或其条件与客户所指示的设备不同，只会改变初始报价。我们以与客户共享的照片的每一步记录我们的调查结果。客户可以同意修订的报价，或者如果他们没有，我们将以每美元发货给他们。</p><p> We specifically train our support team to see the trade from the point of view of the customer, with empathy, and to advocate for the customer. If devices are damaged in transit or we make a mistake in the inspection, we seek to fix it immediately. We strongly believe in giving full and fair value to customers for their trade ins. This helps fuel the circular economy, and sustainability, and it is part of our corporate purpose.</p><p> 我们专门培训我们的支持团队，从客户的角度来看，同情，并向客户倡导。如果设备在运输途中损坏或者在检查中造成错误，我们会立即解决它。我们强烈地相信为客户提供完全公平的价值。这有助于燃料循环经济和可持续性，这是我们公司宗旨的一部分。</p><p>  As for McGloin, he’s not sure what’s he’s going to do now with his returned MacBook. “I actually have no idea. I’m not really aware of alternative trade-in options,” he says, adding that he has in the past opted to donate used products or gifted them to a friend.</p><p>  至于麦格林，他不确定他现在的返回MacBook现在正在做什么。 “我实际上不知道。我并不真正意识到替代贸易选择，“他说，并补充说，他已经过去选择捐赠使用的产品或将他们的礼物给朋友。</p><p> For now, the computer sits packed up in Phobio’s shipping box, with no visible white spots and no explanation as to how a perfectly functional Apple laptop from four years ago could now be considered worth less than a pair of AirPods.</p><p> 目前，电脑坐在Phobio的装运箱中，没有明显的白色斑点，没有解释四年前的完美功能性苹果笔记本电脑现在可以考虑不到一对Airpods。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/22368541/apple-trade-in-phobio-macbook-white-spots?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">https://www.theverge.com/22368541/apple-trade-in-phobio-macbook-white-spots?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/报价/">#报价</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/describe/">#describe</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/phobio/">#phobio</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
