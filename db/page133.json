", "note_en": "Most terminal user interfaces can be used by blind users pretty easily. But why is that, actually? After all, the content of a terminal is pretty much unstructured data. A rectangular grid of characters with no extra information except colours. But is that really true?\n The most important bit of metadata for a terminal screen reader is actually the cursor location. This is the one bit of information that is required to make a unstructured grid of characters surprisingly useful to a person mostly constraint to linear reading.\n The terminal cursor acts as the focus. It indicates which part of the screen is currently being edited or selected. For editors, this is a pretty well understood concept. Where the cursor is, the next character will be inserted. However, there is more to a  text-based user interface then just editing fields. And the cursor is not always visible.\n  A while ago, I looked at the  brick terminal UI library for Haskell. When I tried its various  demo programs, I noticed that  my screen reader was reporting the cursor being in the lower right corner of the application when a menu item was selected. I had to manually investigate the screen and look at attributes (colours) to figure out which item in a list was currently selected. Amongst BRLTTY developers, we\u2019ve decided long ago to not work around these issues on the screen reader side, rather try and make use of open source and fix the problems whenever we see them in the wild. Behind the scenes, we have fixed a bunch of frameworks and applications to place the cursor at the locus of focus. So I set out to understand brick internals to fix this.\n  brick works different from most TUI frameworks I know. You don\u2019t have a single cursor which you set to a particular location. Rather, all the different components drawn on the screen can declare their own cursor location, and the composition mechansim ultimately chooses which cursor should be used.\n This, while being pretty flexible, looked fundamentally wrong to me. Why? It doesn\u2019t reflect the reality of a terminal.\n  There is no such thing as \u201cno cursor\u201d in a terminal. The cursor might be hidden, so it is not rendered on the screen. But the cursor still has a location where it sits and waits to print the next output character to the screen. A screen reader will pick that location up, no matter if the cursor is visible or hidden.\n  So after patching brick to declare a cursor when rendering certain list items, checkboxes and radio items, I realized the actual missing bit. brick had no concept of cursor visibility. Rather, if the composition mechansim did not see a cursor declared, it would hide the cursor on-screen and \u201cpretend\u201d there was none. However, as we have learnt above, thats just not true and programs like screen readers actually rely on the cursor location to indicate the locus of fucs.\n Raising this issue with the brick maintainer uncovered the fact that the low level  vty library used by brick to do the actual terminal output did not have a concept of a hidden cursor either. Jonathan fixed this in  vty 5.33.\n  And since vty 5.33 is now in stack LTS, I thought to myself yesterday it is time to finally  add support for invisible cursors to brick.\n There is now a new function putCursor which has the same type signature as the already existing  showCursor, but will make sure the cursor is not visible on-screen. This can and should be used to place a cursor at the locus of focus, even if that location is already visually indicated by different attributes.\n The stock widgets that come with brick should now all be screen reader friendly.

Given the current economic climate and the increased reliance jobseekers and professionals everywhere are placing on LinkedIn, our responsibility is to help create safe experiences for our members. We couldn\u2019t be clearer that hate speech is not tolerated on our platform. LinkedIn is a strong part of our members\u2019 professional identities for the entirety of their career \u2014 it can be seen by their employer, colleagues and potential business partners.\u201d\n In the EU \u2018illegal hate speech\u2019 can mean content that espouses racist or xenophobic views, or which seeks to incite violence or hatred against groups of people because of their race, skin color, religion or ethnic origin etc.\n A number of Member States have national laws on the issue \u2014 and some have  passed their own legislation specifically targeted at the digital sphere. So the EU Code is supplementary to any actual hate speech legislation. It is also non-legally binding.\n The initiative kicked off  back in 2016 \u2014 when a handful of tech giants (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft) agreed to accelerate takedowns of illegal speech (or well, attach their brand names to the PR opportunity associated with saying they would).\n Since the Code became operational, a handful of other tech platforms have joined \u2014 with video sharing platform  TikTok signing up last October, for example.\n But plenty of digital services (notably messaging platforms) still aren\u2019t participating. Hence the Commission\u2019s call for more digital services companies to get on board.\n At the same time, the EU is in the process of firming up hard rules in the area of illegal content.\n L ast year the Commission proposed broad updates (aka the  Digital Services Act) to existing ecommerce rules  to set operational ground rules that they said are intended to bring online laws in line with offline legal requirements \u2014 in areas such as illegal content, and indeed illegal goods.  So, in the coming years, the bloc will get a legal framework that tackles \u2014 at least at a high level \u2014 the hate speech issue, not merely a voluntary Code.\n The EU also recently adopted legislation on terrorist content takedowns ( this April) \u2014 which is set to start applying to online platforms from next year.\n But it\u2019s interesting to note that, on the perhaps more controversial issue of hate speech (which can deeply intersect with freedom of expression), the Commission wants to maintain a self-regulatory channel alongside incoming legislation \u2014 as Reynders\u2019 remarks underline.\n Brussels evidently sees value in having a mixture of \u2018carrots and sticks\u2019 where hot button digital regulation issues are concerned. Especially in the controversial \u2018danger zone\u2019 of speech regulation.\n So, while the DSA is set to bake in standardized \u2018notice and response\u2019 procedures to help digital players swiftly respond to illegal content, by keeping the hate speech Code around it means there\u2019s a parallel conduit where key platforms could be encouraged by the Commission to commit to going further than the letter of the law (and thereby enable lawmakers to sidestep any controversy if they were to try to push more expansive speech moderation measures into legislation).\n  The EU has \u2014 for several years \u2014 had a  voluntary a Code of Practice on Online Disinformation too. (And a spokeswoman for LinkedIn confirmed it has been signed up to that since its inception, also through its parent company Microsoft.)\n And while lawmakers recently  announced a plan to beef that Code up \u2014 to make it \u201cmore binding\u201d, as they oxymoronically put it \u2014 it certainly isn\u2019t planning to legislate on that (even fuzzier) speech issue.\n In further public remarks today on the hate speech Code, the Commission said that a fifth monitoring exercise in June 2020 showed that on average companies reviewed 90% of reported content within 24 hours and removed 71% of content that was considered to be illegal hate speech.\n It added that it welcomed the results \u2014 but also called for signatories to redouble their efforts, especially around providing feedback to users and in how they approach transparency around reporting and removals.\n The Commission has also repeatedly calls for platforms signed up to the disinformation Code to do more to tackle the tsunami of \u2018fake news\u2019 being fenced on their platforms, including \u2014 on the public health front \u2014 what they last year dubbed a  coronavirus infodemic.\n The COVID-19 crisis has undoubtedly contributed to concentrating lawmakers\u2019 minds on the complex issue of how to effectively regulate the digital sphere and likely accelerated a number of EU efforts.", "posttime":

", "note_en": "The leader of the Vlog Squad built an empire on goofy pranks and wild stunts. Now he\u2019s under fire for turning trauma into content. Can he make a comeback in a culture driven by clicks?\n         The YouTuber David Dobrik is driving his white Tesla through the verdant hills of suburban Los Angeles, explaining the challenges of selling thin-crust-style pizza in L.A., his assistant Natalie texting in the back seat and Billy Joel on pause on the stereo, when he abruptly stops talking. \u201cI got this,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, guys.\u201d He leaps out of the driver\u2019s seat to help an elderly lady with a walker cross the street.\n Just a few short hours ago, on the tail end of several controversies surrounding Dobrik and his   collective, the Vlog Squad, squad member Jeff Wittek had released a video alleging that Dobrik permanently maimed him in an elaborate stunt gone wrong. All over social media, people were calling Dobrik a sociopath and accusing him of mining his friends\u2019 trauma for content. And here he was, blithely chatting about his new pizza franchise and helping an old lady cross the street.\n  After a few seconds, Dobrik jumps back into the car, giggling. \u201cWe did that on purpose for you,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wanted to have a grandma crossing the street, but I couldn\u2019t keep my composure.\u201d As we drive away, the woman, who Natalie and David tell me was an actor paid $200 simply to walk in front of our car, waves and grins.\n When I ask Dobrik if this scene was staged as a way to distract from or counteract the effects of the Wittek video, he looks at me, confused and maybe a little bit wounded that I would so grossly misinterpret the intention behind a fun prank. \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were just trying to do something stupid and silly.\u201d And I laugh, partially because it  is stupid and silly, but also because I\u2019m in a $150,000 car in the Hollywood Hills with an extremely wealthy and charismatic stranger and his assistant, and I don\u2019t want to seem like I can\u2019t take a joke, even though I\u2019m not entirely sure what the joke is.\n Such is my initiation into David Dobrik\u2019s world: where the lines are constantly blurred between fantasy and reality, what\u2019s genuine and what\u2019s content; where everyone is having fun, no one could possibly get hurt, and the rehabilitation of one\u2019s reputation is just $200 and a call to a casting agency away.\n Calling Dobrik a YouTuber is sort of like calling Batman a morose vigilante with a trust fund: While technically true, it\u2019s far from the whole story. Dobrik is the leader of the Vlog Squad, a motley crew of aspiring comedians, Instagram sexpots, and other sundry influencers and creators who zip around Los Angeles filming gross-out pranks, stunts, and lavish giveaways, resulting in an aesthetic that\u2019s a cross of  Jackass,  Entourage, and  The Oprah Winfrey Show. Dobrik has racked up more than 18 million followers on his main channel alone and, in 2020, was estimated by  Forbes to have earned $15.5 million. His white Tesla has been a fixture on the streets of L.A., portending for unsuspecting passersby free iPads or cash or cars, or, if nothing else, the tantalizing promise of 36 million eyeballs on them.\n  Those who follow Dobrik\u2019s slickly edited, four-minute-and-20-second vlogs are intimately familiar with the members of his crew: Jason Nash, a 48-year-old former comic turned co-host of Dobrik\u2019s podcast  Views; aspiring musician and straight man Scotty Sire; reformed bad boy Wittek; Corinna Kopf, a former Hooters waitress and tinder for dumb-blonde jokes; and Natalie Mariduena, Dobrik\u2019s comely 24-year-old assistant and high school best friend, who\u2019s perpetually rumored to be dating him. (Mariduena is actually dating fellow Vlog Squad member Todd Smith, but that doesn\u2019t stop her and Dobrik from playing up a flirtation whenever possible, as she acknowledges: \u201cPeople love seeing us together. They love us interacting with each other and doing funny stuff. Relationship stuff on the internet always is like good clickbait. It gets good views and whatnot.\u201d)\n Functionally, the Vlog Squad primarily serve as yes-men; when they\u2019re not confronting one of their deep-seated phobias or performing some daredevil stunt, they\u2019re on the sidelines, laughing uproariously at the action. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like the modern-day  Friends, with a laugh track,\u201d says Wittek of squad members\u2019 roles. \u201cIt tells someone that this is a joke, that it\u2019s OK to laugh at it here.\u201d Many of the more popular recurring characters in Dobrik\u2019s videos are his childhood friends, which helps to foster the gang-of-goofballs dynamic. His housemate Ilya, Mariduena, and Mariduena\u2019s own assistant Reggie are all from Dobrik\u2019s Illinois hometown. \u201cHe\u2019s so attached to his childhood and his youth and his inner being as a kid,\u201d says Mariduena.\n In the center of it all is Dobrik with his camera, affable, puppy-eyed, and perpetually amused by everything and everybody. In person, he is just as unfailingly enthusiastic. \u201cEverybody that has money, everybody that has success, hides all of it. It\u2019s something you shouldn\u2019t talk about, or like a secret,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I like sharing all of it. I love showing people things. I\u2019m obsessed with it.\u201d\n  The moment I step into his $9.5 million Sherman Oaks mansion, he does just that. First, he brings me over to his Hawaiian Punch water fountain, inspired by the Adam Sandler film  Mr. Deeds. Next, he shows me his office, where he records his podcast, and which I recognize from one of his recent apology videos, where he was flanked by a Kids\u2019 Choice Award and a potted Baby Groot. We end in the living room, which looks as if it\u2019s been decorated by a 12-year-old with an unlimited budget: There\u2019s a life-size R2D2 animatronic he bought via his friend John Stamos; a Buzz Lightyear portrait made of Rubik\u2019s cubes; a framed photo of a text exchange referencing his losing $288,000 on GameStop stocks (\u201cI wanted something out of that negative situation, like some kind of art piece,\u201d he says. \u201cI told the internet I only lost 80K, so if you could tell them I didn\u2019t lose that much, that\u2019d be great\u201d); rows upon rows of hard candy. Mariduena and Dobrik\u2019s other assistant, an amiable young blond woman named Taylor Hudson who also regularly appears in his videos, stay anchored to the kitchen island on their phones and laptops, the adults in the room, even though both are also in their mid-twenties.\n Shaggy-haired and casually dressed in a Dodgers cap, track pants, and a T-shirt from the restaurant Jon and Vinny\u2019s, Dobrik reminds me of Tom Hanks\u2019 character at the end of  Big, after he finds the Zoltar machine \u2014 a child cosplaying in an adult man\u2019s body. At one point, his attention wavers and he starts casually roaming around his kitchen on a penny board. I half expect someone to come out and yell at him to stop doing that in the house; but, of course, he is 24, and it is his $9.5 million house, so no one does. In all, he comes off as someone who is constantly in awe of the cosmic ridiculousness of his own good fortune. \u201cDavid hasn\u2019t really experienced much pain in his life,\u201d notes Wittek. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty smooth upbringing for him. His life has kind of been just straight up and not really many downs.\u201d\n  Dobrik moved to this new home in January, but he has not yet sold his old house nearby, allowing friends to use it for shoots. The next day I\u2019ll get a tour of that one, too, with Dobrik pointing out the detritus of old stunts, videos, and branding campaigns: a Chipotle-burrito claw machine the company gave him after releasing a burrito in his honor; a miniature Tesla; a ceiling damaged by an elephant toothpaste prank. As we walk through the garage, he tells me about a time a few years ago when he found a homeless person asleep on his couch at 2 a.m., wearing his merch; the man had defecated all over his couch. I ask if he posted it to YouTube, and he says yes.\n  \u201cBecause I\u2019ll never remember it better than if it was on film,\u201d he says. \u201cI just love filming things. I don\u2019t get why people don\u2019t film everything. Everything should be filmed.\u201d\n  At the start of 2020, Dobrik was uniquely positioned for crossover success, something he is not shy about admitting he has always craved. \u201cRight now, there\u2019s almost like a caste system in the entertainment world, where if you\u2019re a YouTuber or a TikToker, you\u2019re just branded as that,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve struggled with accepting myself because I\u2019ve always wanted the respect of the traditional world. But I\u2019ve always known that at one point, the traditional world is going to meet up with being here, and it\u2019s all going to be the same.\u201d\n With the 2019 launch of his photo app Dispo, which mimics the look and the experience of developing disposable-camera pictures, Dobrik had crossed over into the tech space. Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian was a lead investor, and at one point, the app had a nearly $200 million valuation. Also in the works were a TV series and a pizza franchise called Doughbrik\u2019s, as well as brand deals with corporate giants like HelloFresh, DoorDash, and SeatGeek. \u201cHe\u2019s inherently entrepreneurial,\u201d says Joe Gagliese, CEO of influencer marketing firm Viral Nation, who\u2019s known Dobrik since he was getting started on the now-defunct platform Vine in 2013. \u201cHe was knocking on the door of being the face of major brands across the U.S. He was right there.\u201d\n  And then, he wasn\u2019t. In the spring of 2021, former Vlog Squad members like Seth Francois and Nik Keswani, a.k.a. Big Nik, started to accuse Dobrik of building a culture of bullying, cultural insensitivity, and consent violations. In March,  Insider published the account of a woman named \u201cHannah,\u201d who accused Dobrik\u2019s longtime friend and Vlog Squad member \u201cDurte\u201d Dom Zeglaitis of sexually assaulting her in a 2018 incident that was partially captured by Dobrik on video. Major brands started to distance themselves from Dobrik, and he resigned from the board of Dispo. His fans, primarily zoomers who had come of age watching his energetic vlogs, also started to turn on him. He lost a total of 400,000 followers during March and April, according to SocialBlade data.\n Then came the revelation, the day of our first meeting in April, that he had grievously injured Wittek in a stunt involving an excavator on a lake in Utah, inspired by an extreme-sports YouTuber named Devin Super Tramp. The footage reignited an outcry from people accusing Dobrik of exploiting Vlog Squad members and endangering them for views. And even though this is far from a rare phenomenon in the beef-driven, controversy-fueled, caps-lock-titled world of YouTube, the fact that Dobrik had amassed a reputation as something of a wholesome boy next door (despite the bulk of his content being fairly profane and fratty) made his fall from grace even more precipitous. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t on such a pedestal anymore,\u201d says Trisha Paytas, a YouTuber who was briefly in the Vlog Squad. Paytas, who goes by they/them pronouns, has frequently criticized the group on their podcast  Frenemies.\n During my visit, Dobrik was on a self-imposed social media hiatus; though he\u2019d previously spent most of his time shooting, editing, or ideating content, now his days consisted of little more than the occasional pizza-franchise meeting. (He resumed posting on June 15th, with a video titled \u201cSURPRISING MY FRIENDS!!!\u201d which showed his squad on vacation in Hawaii and made no mention of the controversies.) Our meeting had been in the works for a while, before the  Insider story broke, and in the days leading up to it, as his sponsors fell away and the social media mobs swarmed, I became more and more sure that he was going to cancel. But he didn\u2019t, and as we sat by his infinity pool on a sunny Friday afternoon, it was clear why: He was still struggling to make sense of what he had done to warrant such ire.\n  \u201cI didn\u2019t understand that what we were making had such power. I didn\u2019t understand it,\u201d he says, looking smaller than his five-foot-10 frame in an oversize sweatshirt. \u201cSo when [the  Insider story came out], I was like, \u2018What? I\u2019m responsible for someone making a bad decision?\u2019 I didn\u2019t get it. But it was all because of this environment of wanting to put on this show.\u201d\n As a child growing up in Ko\u0161ice, Slovakia, Dobrik was reserved and \u201chighly sensitive,\u201d his mother, Kristina, says. He\u2019d slept in his parents\u2019 bedroom until he was five, and would cry every morning before he went to preschool. Once, she recalls, she brought him toys to play with in the sandbox, and some bigger kids came over and took them. But David didn\u2019t get upset. \u201cHe just sat down and was just very happy watching how they played with his toys,\u201d she says. \u201cI was happy he didn\u2019t make any fuss about it, though I didn\u2019t want him to be a pushover. But he was just so happy he could share his toys.\u201d\n When he was five years old, Dobrik\u2019s parents moved to Toledo, Ohio, where Kristina had previously lived for a year with an elderly relative after graduating from high school. Kristina had learned some English from watching  Full House reruns and loved how friendly people were in America. \u201cIt seemed like a good idea to go overseas, to make a better life for David,\u201d she says. When the family relocated to Skokie, Illinois, outside of Chicago, David followed them there, flying on a plane from Slovakia all by himself. They later moved to nearby Vernon Hills, an upper-middle-class suburb, where Dobrik\u2019s father started a real-estate-photography company, while Kristina stayed at home with David.\n Kristina says David underwent something of a metamorphosis in America, blossoming from a shy kid to a gregarious class clown; his first words in English, she says, were \u201cgood boy,\u201d which is what his kindergarten teachers called him. At his home, Dobrik shows me an essay he wrote in high school, in which he recounts his journey from Slovakia and expresses his joy at having left the country. Because of his DACA status, he has not been back to the country of his birth since he was seven years old, but he has little interest. \u201cI was obsessed with America. I thought it was like the coolest fucking place in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom how I remember it, Slovakia is very much like if you were to watch a documentary about the Soviet Union or Russia that shows kids in a line with trays and an old lunch lady putting beans on a tray. I almost see it, like, in a different filter, like in sepia. It\u2019s so clich\u00e9, but here is like the land of opportunity, and you can become anything you want.\u201d\n   Dobrik didn\u2019t have a girlfriend in high school \u2014 he was \u201ctoo squirrel-brained\u201d for that, says his former tennis coach Shannon Etnyre \u2014 but he was friendly and generally well-liked, the type of kid who\u2019d randomly offer hugs to students in the halls. \u201cHe was perfectly right in the middle and friends with everybody,\u201d says Mariduena. He was also a mediocre student, putting in just enough effort to pass his classes. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t wrap my head around why it mattered,\u201d says Dobrik.\n Yet even though he spent the majority of his time arguing with teachers over doing work, many of them, like his English teacher Jeff Killinger, couldn\u2019t help but like him. \u201cHis philosophy was, \u2018If I can cheat or in some way get this work done in a way that doesn\u2019t require effort, then that\u2019s fine,\u2019\u201d says Killinger, who became a mentor to Dobrik after graduation, fielding FaceTime calls and requests to help with Dobrik\u2019s taxes. \u201c[Every day] I\u2019d say, \u2018I\u2019m not gonna let this kid do this to me tomorrow,\u2019 and every day he would. He was just that charming and funny.\u201d\n Dobrik took an equally laissez-faire approach to tennis, which he started playing as a young child and continued throughout high school. Etnyre remembers him as an \u201cawkward-looking freshman with a Justin Bieber haircut\u201d who was nonetheless \u201cjust destroying on the tennis court.\u201d Ultimately, Dobrik was good enough to become all-state and be scouted by various universities. \u201cI liked that if you fuck up, that you\u2019re to blame,\u201d he says of his attraction to the sport. \u201cI hated the pressure of letting the team down. It\u2019s so much easier when you\u2019re just playing by yourself and then you fuck up. It\u2019s just on you.\u201d (Despite this aversion to pressure, Dobrik has an indisputably competitive side: When I watch him play at Mulholland Tennis Club a few hours later, he is intensely focused, chiding his doubles partner Mariduena for missing shots. \u201cWe\u2019re just having fun right now,\u201d Jason Nash, who was in recovery from hip surgery, calls from the sidelines. \u201cNothing fun about this,\u201d Dobrik retorts.)\n  Though Dobrik had murky aspirations of joining the entertainment business in some capacity, he was always fascinated by the idea of making money. \u201cA lot of people that come from overseas that are immigrants and first generation are really, really hungry to be successful, and that was definitely his case,\u201d says Dobrik\u2019s best friend and housemate Ilya Fedorovich, who was born in Belarus. \u201cHis family and my family, we\u2019re not the richest. We survive by our means. I think that one of the reasons that he\u2019s supersuccessful now is that he didn\u2019t have much when he was growing up, but he wanted a lot.\u201d In high school, when Dobrik was working as a waiter, he and his friends would discuss their incomes with one another in the school cafeteria. \u201cPeople say money doesn\u2019t buy happiness. And I completely get that,\u201d Dobrik says. \u201cBut I think you can alleviate so much stress and so much burden from money, so it helps you to the road of happiness.\u201d\n When Dobrik was 16, Mariduena introduced him to the social media outlet that would change his life forever: the short-form video platform Vine. At the time he joined, Vine was starting to become a launching pad for creators like King Bach, Nash Grier, and Dobrik\u2019s future girlfriend Liza Koshy. Even though he only had a few thousand followers early on, Dobrik saw the potential. \u201cI saw the people making money on Vine and actually getting brand deals and moving out to L.A., and I was like, \u2018Holy fuck, I think I could turn this into a career,\u2019\u201d he says. He won his first brand deal, $50 for a to-do-list app called Do!, in high school, and celebrated with his friends at Buffalo Wild Wings.\n What\u2019s notable about Dobrik\u2019s early Vines is not just how young he looks \u2014 he has braces, wears rubber bracelets, and mugs for the camera with his trademark puppyish enthusiasm \u2014 but how much darker they are than his more aw-shucks YouTube presence. In one Vine, he pretends to be a disabled person in a wheelchair; in another, he chides a friend for making an Asian joke, saying, \u201cThey have enough on their plate. Like cats and dogs\u201d; and in another, he says the n-word. He issued a vague apology for these offenses last summer.\n  In speaking about his earlier content, Dobrik blames a combination of the freewheeling climate on Vine and his youth. \u201cI was a fucking 16-year-old idiot,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was just chaos. And it was just the way Vine was. It was so much darker, and no one batted an eye when you did stuff like that.\u201d But even though he pivoted away from explicit edgelord humor once he started blowing up, there is an element of his vlog persona that has remained consistent. Much of the humor is contingent on knowing the identities of the people in his videos: the skeevy older man (Nash), the slutty girl (Kopf), the heartthrob (Smith), the fat kid (Nick Antonyan, a.k.a. Jonah), the bad boy (Wittek). Even though it\u2019s his channel, Dobrik is rarely the butt of the joke.\n A semester into his first year at College of Lake County in Illinois, Dobrik visited Los Angeles to network with other Viners as a trial period for potentially moving out West. On the plane ride back to Chicago, he says, he had the distinct sense that L.A. was his home. \u201cIt was a dramatic, Troy Bolton,  High School Musical-type scene. Like, \u2018This is my dream, I have to pursue it,\u2019\u201d he says. With two of his high school friends, including Dom, and a third friend he\u2019d met on Vine, he moved into a small apartment in West Hollywood. His father was a guara\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-26 00:28:48", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "youtube,2020,dobrik,turning", "title": "David Dobrik\u7684\u6982\u51b5\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u611a\u8822\u7684\u6076\u4f5c\u5267\u81ed\u540d\u662d\u7740\u7684\u611a\u8822\u6076\u4f5c\u5267\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u57282020\u5e74\u8d5a\u53d6\u4e861550\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u5728\u706b\u707e\u4e2d\u906d\u5230\u9020\u6210\u521b\u4f24 ", "title_en": "Profile of David Dobrik, a YouTuber notorious for goofy pranks who earned an estimated $15.5M in 2020, and is now under fire for turning trauma into content", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/david-dobrik-youtube-vlog-squad-profile-1185706/amp/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["youtube", "2020", "dobrik", "turning"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "3bc79af79f487823f46ad624d21a285b.jpg", "infoid": 1068266, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Rust\u88ab\u6392\u540d\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u6700\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002 \u5728\u672c\u7cfb\u5217\u4e2d\uff0c\u60a8\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60Rust\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u9762\u3002 \u6211\u4eec\u9996\u5148\u8981\u505a...
