This information will continue to be updated and overlaps somewhat with the  coreutils FAQ,with this list focusing on less frequent potential issues.\n chmod -R is redundant and tricky.If for example you copy a dir from VFAT and want to turn off executable bits on filesusing  chmod -R 644,that will fail to recurse as it removes the executable bits from dirs.This is achievable in various ways:  cut doesn&#39;t work with fields separated by arbitrary whitespace.It&#39;s often better to use  awk oreven  join -a1 -o1.$field $file /dev/null cut -s only suppresses lines without delimiters.Therefore if you have a line with a missing fieldbut it does contain some delimiters, a blank line is output\n Similarly, if you want to output a blank line when there are no delimitersone needs to append a delimiter like:\n  dd  iflag=fullblock is usually what you wantbecause when reading from a fifo/pipe you often get a short read,which means you get too little data if you specify &#34; count&#34;,or too much data if you specify &#34; sync&#34;. For example: Note we do warn in certain cases since version 8.10, but not with count=1 aboveas short reads are often used with count=1 as an idiom to &#34;consume available data&#34;,though perhaps  dd iflag=nonblock would be a moredirect and general way to do that? dd  conv=noerror really also needs  conv=syncso that if reading from failing disk,one gets correctly aligned data, with unreadable bits replaced with NULs.Note if there is a read error anywhere in a block,the whole block will be discarded. So one needsto balance between speed (bigger) and minimized data loss (smaller).This is simpler and more dynamic in a more dedicated toollike  ddrescue.\n dd  skip=0x100 doesn&#39;t skip anythingas the &#34;0x&#34; prefix is treated as a zero multiplier.coreutils &gt;= 8.26 will warn about this at least,suggesting to use &#34;00x&#34; if that really was the intention.\n For full portability the  -P option is neededwhen parsing the output from df. Line wrapping is avoided, thoughdf will no longer wrap lines since version 8.11 (Apr 2011) to helpavoid this gotcha. Also if one needs to parse the header,the  -P option will use more standardised (but ambiguous) wording.See also the  Block size issue. If two or more hard links point to the same file, only one of thehard links is counted. The FILE argument order affects which links arecounted, and changing the argument order may change the numbers that du outputs. Note this also impacts specified directories which is confusing: $ cd git/coreutils$ du -s ./ ./tests593120 ./$ du -s ./tests ./  # depth first gets items listed (though counted independently)10036 ./tests583084 ./ # Note order is significant even with implicit independence$ du -s --separate-dirs ./tests ./128 ./tests16268 ./$ du -s --separate-dirs ./ ./tests16268 ./\nNote du doesn&#39;t handle  reflinked files specially,and thus will count all instances of a reflinked file.  echo is non portable and its behaviour diverges betweensystems and shell builtins etc. One should really consider using printf instead.This shell session illustrates some inconsistencies.Where you see  env being used, that is selecting the coreutilsstandalone version: $ echo -e -n  # outputs nothing$ echo -n -e$ echo -- -n  # option terminator outputted-- -n$ POSIXLY_CORRECT=1 env echo -e -n-e -n$ POSIXLY_CORRECT=1 env echo -n -e  # no output either \u203d\n The exit status of expr is a confusing gotcha.POSIX states that exit status of 1 is used if &#34;the expression evaluates to null or zero&#34;,which you can see in these examples: $ expr 2 - 1; echo $?10$ expr 2 - 2; echo $?01$ expr substr 01 1 1; echo $?01$ expr &#39; &#39; : &#39;^ *$&#39;; echo $?10$ expr &#39;&#39; : &#39;^ *$&#39;; echo $?01 # number of matched characters returned$ expr 0 : &#39;[0-9]$&#39;; echo $?10 # actual matched characters returned$ expr 0 : &#39;\\([0-9]\\)$&#39;; echo $?01\nThe string matching above is especially confusing, thoughdoes conform to POSIX, and is consistent across solaris, FreeBSD and GNU utils. As for changing the behaviour, it&#39;s probably not possible due tobackwards compatibility issues. For example the &#39;^..*$&#39; casewould need to change the handling of the &#39;*&#39; in the expression,which would break a script like: printf &#39;%s\\n&#39; 1 2 &#39;&#39; 3 |while read line; do expr &#34;$line&#34; : &#39;^[0-9]*$&#39; &gt;/dev/null || break # at first blank line echo process &#34;$line&#34;done\nNote, using a leading ^ in the expression is redundant and non portable. ls -lrt will also reverse sort names for fileswith matching timestamps (common in /dev/ and /proc/ etc.)This is as per POSIX but probably not what the user wanted.There is no way to reverse by time and have non reversed name sorting.  ln -nsf is needed to update symlinks,though note that this will overwrite existing files,and cause links to be created within existing directories.  mkdir -p --mode=... only applies the mode to theright-most directory. Any parent directories are created with&#39;u+wx&#39; modified by umask. If you want to control the mode for all created dirs,you can use a umask like Note that the user &#39;wx&#39; bits can not be cleared for parent dirs.Note also that special mode bits like setuid are not set atomically,either with --mode on the right-most directory, or a subsequent chmod requiredfor created parent directories. Note also to be careful with  chmod -R  If changing the umask before invoking mkdir is not that easy - maybebecause not called via a shell -, then an alternative to the aboveumask method is to specify each of the target directories separately,e.g.: But it is important to know that &#39;mkdir&#39; does not adjust the permissionbits if any of those directories already existed.If you do want to ensure a directory hierarchy with particular permissionsone can use the `install` command instead like:   nl defaults to  -d &#39;\\:&#39; by default.Therefore any lines that contain only  &#39;\\:&#39;,  &#39;\\:\\:&#39;or  &#39;\\:\\:\\:&#39; will reset numbering.If you want to number lines irrespective on content then you need to specify  -d &#39;&#39;,or alternatively use the less flexible  cat -n option. The checksum utilities like md5sum, sha1sum etc. add backslashes to the output namesif those names contain &#39;\\n&#39; or &#39;\\&#39; characters. Also &#39;*&#39; is added to the outputwhere O_BINARY is significant (CYGWIN). Therefore automatic processing of theseutilities require one to  unescape first.  rm -rf does not mean &#34;delete as much as possible&#34;. It only avoids prompts.For example with a non writeable dir, you will not be ableto remove any contents. Therefore this is sometimes necessary to:  A very common issue encountered is with the default ordering of the  sort utility.Usually what is required is a simple byte comparison, though by default the collationorder of the current locale is used. To use the simple comparison logic you can LC_ALL=C sort ... as detailed in the FAQ. As well as being slower, the locale based ordering can often be surprising.For example some character representations,like the full width forms of latin numbers, compare equal to each other. $ printf &#39;%s\\n&#39; \uff12 \uff11 | ltrace -e strcoll sortsort-&gt;strcoll(&#34;\\357\\274\\222&#34;, &#34;\\357\\274\\221&#34;) = 0\uff12\uff11$ printf &#39;%s\\n&#39; \uff12 \uff11 | sort -u\uff12\nThe equal comparison issue with --unique can even impact inthe &#34;C&#34; locale, for example with  --numeric-sort dropping items unexpectedly.Note this example also demonstrates that --unique implies --stable,to select the first encountered item in the matching set.  Related to locale ordering, there is the  i18n patchon Fedora/RHEL/SUSE which has its own issues. Note disabling the locale specifichandling as described above effectively avoids these issues.  Example 2: case folding results in incorrect ordering:  Fields specified with  -k are separated by default by runs of blank characters (space and tab),and by default the blank characters preceding a field are  included in the comparison,which depending on your locale could be significant to the sorting order. This is confusing enoughon its own, but is compounded with the  --field-separator and  --ignore-leading-blanks options.Ignoring leading blanks (-b) is particularly confusing, because... Also precisely specifying a particular field, requires both the start  and endfields specified. I.E. to sort on field 2 you use -k2 ,2. These field delineation issues along with others are so confusing,that the  sort --debug option was addedin version 8.6 to highlight the matching extent and other consequences of the various options.\n  sort -R does randomize the input similarlyto the shuf command, but also ensures that matching keys are grouped together.shuf also provides optimizations when outputting a subset of the input.  split produces file names that may be surprising,as it defaults to a two letter suffix for initial files, butto support an arbitrary number of files, has a feature to widen the letters inthe output file names as needed. The widening scheme ensures file names are sorted correctlywhen using standard shell sorting, when subsequently listing orconcatenating the resultant files. For example:  split behaves the same with the --numeric-suffixes/-d option, which couldlead to unexpected numeric sequences. This was done again to ease sortingof the output (which is usually not inspected by humans for large sequences),but mainly for backwards compatibility with existing concatenation scriptsthat use standard sorting. The recommended solution is to specify a -a/--suffix-length parameterwhich still allows for standard ordering at the shell,but with more natural numbers:  tac like  wc has issues dealing with files withouta last &#39;\\n&#39; character.  tail -F is probably what you want rather than -fas the latter doesn&#39;t follow log rotations etc. tee by default will exit immediately upon receiving SIGPIPEto be POSIX compliant and to support applications like yes | tee log | timeout process.Now this is problematic in the presence of &#34;early close&#34; pipes,often seen when combining tee with bash &gt;(process substitutions).Starting with coreutils 8.24 (Jul 2015), tee has the new -p, --output-erroroption to control the operation in such cases. $ seq 100000 | tee &gt;(head -n1) &gt; &gt;(tail -n1)114139$ seq 100000 | tee -p &gt;(head -n1) &gt; &gt;(tail -n1)1100000\n The mode of operation of test depends on the number of arguments.Therefore you will not get an expected error in cases like test -s $file || echo no data &gt;&amp;2,if &#34;$file&#34; is empty or unset. That&#39;s because test(1) will thenbe operating in string testing mode, which will return successdue to &#34;-s&#34; being interpreted as a true expression.Instead ensure the variable is appropriately quoted to avoid such issues: test -s &#34;$file&#34; || echo no data &gt;&amp;2.  wc -l on a file in which the last linedoesn&#39;t end with &#39;\\n&#39; character will return a value of one-less thanmight be expected as wc is standardised to just count &#39;\\n&#39; characters.POSIX in fact doesn&#39;t consider a file without a &#39;\\n&#39; as the last characterto be a text file at all. Also by only counting &#39;\\n&#39; characters resultsin consistent counts whether counting concatenated files, ortotaling individual files.  wc -L counts the maximum  display width for a line,considering only valid, printable characters, but not terminal control codes. # invalid UTF-8 sequence not counted:$ printf &#34;\\xe2\\xf2\\xa5&#34; | wc -L0 # unprintable characters  even in the C locale are not counted:$ printf &#34;\\xe2\\x99\\xa5&#34; | LC_ALL=C wc -L0 # Bytes can be counted using sed:$ printf &#34;\\xe2\\x99\\xa5&#34; | LC_ALL=C sed &#39;s/././g&#39; | wc -L3 # Terminal control chars are not handled specially:$ printf &#39;\\x1b[33mf\\bred\\x1b[m\\n&#39; | tee /dev/tty | wc -L red10\n The  df,  du,  ls --block-sizeoption is unusual in that appending a  B to the unit, changes it  from binary to decimal.I.E. KB means 1000, while K means 1024. In general the units representations in coreutils are unfortunate,but an accident of history.POSIX species &#39;k&#39; and &#39;b&#39; to mean 1024 and 512 respectively.Standards wise &#39;k&#39; should really mean 1000 and &#39;K&#39; 1024.Then extending from that we now have (which we can&#39;t change for compatibility reasons): Note there is new flexibility to consider when controlling theoutput of numeric units, by leveraging the  numfmtutility. For example to control the output of du you could definea function like:  Discussed separately at  Time zone ambiguities", "posttime": "2021-06-18 21:51:51", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

", "note_en": "When Ring wanted to boost sales of it surveillance cameras and burnish its self-styled image as a crime-fighting company, it embarked on a brand-ambassador marketing campaign that would be familiar to many startups. But rather than chase down the Instagram influencers or beat bloggers, the company instead wooed officers at the Los Angeles Police Department.\n For years, including during Amazon\u2019s early ownership of the company, Ring gave no fewer than 100 LAPD officers free devices or discount codes worth tens of thousands of dollars, and possibly more, according to a new report from the  Los Angeles Times.\n Emails obtained by the LA Times through a public records request reveal Ring employees encouraging LAPD officers to \u201cspread the word about how this doorbell is proven to reduce crime in neighborhoods\u201d and offering freebies and discounts.\n \u201cRing and its relationship with police departments, including the LAPD, is but one example of a burgeoning problem in which there is a lack of clarity as to where the public sector ends and private surveillance capitalism begins,\u201d Mohammad Tajsar, senior staff attorney with the ACLU of Southern California, told Ars.\n As word of the influencer campaign spread through the LAPD, officers who weren\u2019t approached by Ring employees reached out to them anyway, requesting free products and discounts.\n \u201cWe have a favor to ask..,\u201d wrote Officer Maria Gray. \u201cEvery year, we have a West LA Division Beach party... We use our measly station fund and buy some gifts to raffle off as prizes. Without me asking, do you see where I\u2019m going with this email? More importantly, we\u2019d love for you to come and attend. Bring some friends, our treat.\u201d August Cziment, Ring\u2019s director of operations, replied, \u201cWe\u2019d be happy to donate a Ring Doorbell and perhaps a new Solar Powered Security sign if that\u2019s of interest? :)\u201d\n Another station received more than $12,000 in freebies after an officer sent an email containing promotional language that he first had Cziment approve.\n     LAPD has an  ethics code, of course. It says that officers may not \u201cuse their position to secure directly or indirectly unwarranted privileges or exemptions for themselves or others\u201d and they \u201cshall not accept any gifts, gratuities or favors of any kind which might reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to influence their actions with respect to City business.\u201d But for many of the cases the Times uncovered, the LAPD did not appear to be concerned. Discount codes are \u201cgenerally not in conflict with our Code of Ethics,\u201d Det. Meghan Aguilar told the LA Times. \u201cOf course, each situation is looked at on a case by case basis.\u201d\n One email exchange shows how officers blurred the lines between advocating for a class of security products like security cameras\u2014which is allowed and sometimes encouraged\u2014and becoming outright salespeople for specific brands like Ring. Officer Eric Mollinedo emailed Ring\u2019s Cziment in April 2016 asking for promo codes and a free doorbell, mentioning that he would be working a booth at a public safety fair. Cziment happily sent him a free unit along with flyers for the booth. Mollinedo later emailed Cziment, saying, \u201cWas a good day today at the Public Safety fair... talked up Ring and had (5) officers/reserve officers purchase them!\u201d\n Tajsar, the ACLU attorney, said this sort of arrangement isn\u2019t surprising. \u201cRing in particular has a history of poaching police chiefs and executives, hiring them, and then using them to peddle Ring\u2019s wares with the connections they have from their former lives,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really is a revolving door Ring has created to gain market share across the country. That raises a whole host of ethical concerns about corruption, pay to play, and ethics rules around disclosures.\u201d\n  Ring\u2019s campaign came at a time when the company had partnered with LAPD to give out 500 free video doorbells in Los Angeles\u2019 Wilshire Park neighborhood in an attempt to prove its crime-fighting claims. In March 2016, LAPD and Ring held a  joint news conference announcing that, after installing just 40 cameras in the neighborhood, burglaries had dropped by 55 percent in six months. Later, the company would amend the results, saying the drop occurred over seven months, not six.\n    Neither claim was peer-reviewed, and Ring hasn\u2019t released the specifics of its study, but a report by  MIT Technology Review cast doubt on the findings. After receiving the locations of the installed cameras from the neighborhood association and after examining public data on crime in those districts, reporter Mark Harris found that burglaries had, in fact, increased when compared with the previous year. What\u2019s more, by 2017, burglaries had surged to their highest in seven years. Nonetheless, Ring  continued to tout its \u201ccrime fighting\u201d capabilities.\n  Ring wound down its influencer campaign around the time it rolled out its Neighbors app, which allows users to share and comment on nearby videos. LAPD was given access to a special Ring-provided portal to locate and request footage. The company bills the portal as a time-saver,  saying in videos it sends to police departments, \u201cNo more going door-to-door to look for cameras and asking for footage.\u201d All investigators have to do is set a specific time and area of interest and Ring assists in contacting users whose camera logs match the query.\n In addition to the arrangement with the LAPD, Ring has made deals with  hundreds of police departments across the US to give them access to the law enforcement portal. Ring\u2019s privacy policy regarding footage is \u201clax,\u201d Tajsar said.\n \u201cThat\u2019s exactly why Ring is so aggressively marketing toward police departments,\u201d Tajsar said. \u201cThey see police departments as the cat\u2019s paw. They can do Ring\u2019s marketing for them rather than Ring coming directly to us.\u201d\n The portal also allows law enforcement in many instances to sidestep the need for a warrant, which provides judicial oversight and greater transparency. Since many Ring users voluntarily post videos to the Neighbors app, departments have access to a pool of people who are more willing to share footage with them.\n After the LA Times contacted Ring for comment ahead of the story, the company updated its policies so people can view footage requests from law enforcement agencies by adding a post category called \u201cRequest for Assistance.\u201d The hitch? You have to use the Neighbors app to see the footage.\n The spread of a privately controlled surveillance network that offers ready access for law enforcement has privacy advocates concerned. \u201cThe potential for abuse here is tremendous,\u201d Tajsar said.\n \u201cIt has so much room for civil liberties violations,\u201d Heidi Boghosian, a lawyer and former executive director of the National Lawyers Guild, told the LA Times. \u201cWhen you have the escalation of people\u2019s fears of property or violent crime, it changes the way they interpret ordinary actions of someone walking down the street or ringing their doorbell,\u201d she said, \u201cAnd that can [lead to] communities of color [being] falsely accused of crimes.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-18 21:15:49",

The Federal Bureau of Investigation reported a  225% increase in total losses from ransomware in the United States in 2020. According to Cybersecurity Ventures, businesses are under attack every 11 seconds, on average, and damage losses are projected to  reach $20 billion worldwide. Against this backdrop, the Cybereason Global Ransomware Study measured how much financial and reputational damage these attacks wreak on businesses.\n Dealing with the aftermath of a ransomware attack can be complicated and costly. The vast majority of organizations experienced  significant business impact due to ransomware attacks, including loss of revenue (66%), damage to the organization\u2019s brand (53%), unplanned workforce reductions (29%), and even closure of the business altogether (25%).\n   After an organization experienced a ransomware attack, the top 5 solutions implemented included security awareness training (48%), security operations (SOC) (48%), endpoint protection (44%), data backup and recovery (43%), and email scanning (41%).\u00a0The least deployed solutions post-attack included web scanning (40%), endpoint detection and response (EDR) and extended detection and response (XDR) technologies (38%), antivirus software (38%), mobile and SMS security solutions (36%), and managed security services provider (MSSP) or managed detection and response (MDR) provider (34%). Only 3% of respondents said they did not make any  new security investments after a ransomware attack.\n Cybereason\u2019s study found that the majority of organizations that chose to pay ransom demands in the past were not immune to subsequent ransomware attacks, often by the same threat actors. In fact, 80% of organizations that paid the ransom were hit by a second attack, and almost half were hit by the same threat group.\n This study offers insight into the business impact of ransomware attacks across key industry verticals and reveals data that can be leveraged to improve ransomware defenses. For example, after an organization experienced a ransomware attack, the top two solutions implemented included security awareness training (48%) and security operations (48%). This research underscores that prevention is the best strategy for managing ransomware risk and ensuring your organization does not fall victim to a ransomware attack in the first place.\n 1,263 cybersecurity professionals took part in the study commissioned by Cybereason and fielded by Censuswide, with participants in varying industries from the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, France, United Arab Emirates, and Singapore.\n  VentureBeat&#39;s mission is to be a digital town square for technical decision-makers to gain knowledge about transformative technology and transact.Our site delivers essential information on data technologies and strategies to guide you as you lead your organizations.

Katie Brown signed   House Bill 2574 into law on Tuesday, adding natural organic reduction to the range of approved after-life options in the west coast state. Sponsored and developed by Rep. Pam Marsh (D - Southern Jackson County), the bill met Oregonians\u2019 growing interest in sustainable alternatives to traditional deathcare.\n    \u201cThis is a hard issue for people to think about; it&#39;s not a decision that any of us get to avoid,\u201d Marsh told Motherboard over the phone. \u201cIt has an appeal, certainly not to all consumers, but to many of us who are really looking for ways to think about how our footprint on the earth continues after life is gone.\u201d\n  The move heeds a   growing call from environmentalists across the country to clean up the end-of-life industry. The most common methods of body disposal come with hefty environmental impacts: traditional burials, in which a corpse is embalmed with formaldehyde and placed in a casket underground, permanently   occupy large swaths of land and have been found to   leach toxins into nearby soil and waterways. Cremation\u2013in which a body is burned into ash\u2014is an energy suck and emits damaging   pollutants and   carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming.\n  By comparison, the process of so-called   natural organic reduction, which breaks down the body into soil, has a small environmental footprint. For example,   Recompose,   the country\u2019s first human composting funeral home does it like this: a corpse is placed in a cylinder with organic materials, like wood chips, plants, and straw, then heated and turned repeatedly for several weeks with a hook until it\u2019s broken down into a nutrient-rich soil that can be delivered back to the family or used for planting.\n   Human composting is the latest of a handful of environmental deathcare options to gain traction across the country as available   cemetery space declines and emissions from cremation mount .\n  Before human composting gained traction,   green burials\u2014in which the body is prepared without chemicals and planted underground in an organic, biodegradable container, often underneath a tree sapling\u2014emerged in 1998 as an alternative to traditional high-impact burial methods, according to the   Green Burial Council. Lauded as an environmentally superior deathcare method, it also makes reckoning with death easier for some. It\u2019s a difficult topic, says Jodie Buller, board member of the Conservation Burial Alliance, but knowing that you or a loved one can die sustainably\u2014through composting or green burials\u2014makes it easier to handle.\n  \u201cIt feels like a very peaceful option,\u201d Buller said. \u201cThe idea that the soil that someone becomes then can be used to nourish plants feels really good to people. It helps break down some of that taboo around death and dying.\u201d\n  Oregon\u2019s law, slated to go into effect in July, 2022, follows similar momentum in neighboring states. Washington became the first in the U.S. to legalize natural organic reduction in   2019, which led to the   opening of   Recompose.

 video) and over 100 augmentations. Each modality\u2019s augmentations are contained within its own sub-library. These sub-libraries include both function-based and class-based transforms, composition operators, and have the option to provide metadata about the transform applied, including its intensity.\n AugLy is a great library to utilize for augmenting your data in model training, or to evaluate the robustness gaps of your model! We designed AugLy to include many specific data augmentations that users perform in real life on internet platforms like Facebook&#39;s -- for example making an image into a meme, overlaying text/emojis on images/videos, reposting a screenshot from social media. While AugLy contains more generic data augmentations as well, it will be particularly useful to you if you&#39;re working on a problem like copy detection, hate speech detection, or copyright infringement where these &#34;internet user&#34; types of data augmentations are prelevant.\n  To see more examples of augmentations, open the Colab notebooks in the README for each modality! (e.g. image  README &amp;  Colab)\n        Or clone AugLy if you want to be able to run our unit tests, contribute a pull request, etc:\n git clone git@github.com:facebookresearch/AugLy.git[Optional, but recommended] conda create -n augly  &amp;&amp; conda activate augly  &amp;&amp; conda install pippip install -e AugLy/\n NOTE: In some environments,  pip doesn&#39;t install  python-magic as expected.
