You don’t mix business with pleasure.”</p><p>“汉娜·蒙塔娜(Hannah Montana)，”20岁的克拉拉(Clara)说，出于对歧视的担忧，她要求不透露自己的姓氏。“两全其美，但你要把它们分开。你不能把工作和娱乐混为一谈。“。</p><p> Clara, who goes to college in Florida, was working in the university hospital as a patient care assistant until she said at least a dozen nurses caught the  coronavirus, and the hospital changed staffing, leaving Clara without a job. Without a paycheck and bills to pay, she decided to open an account on OnlyFans, a site known for homemade pornography. It’s been a hectic couple of months for Clara, and even with the TV character in the back of her head, she said it’s still been a challenge to manage it all.</p><p>在佛罗里达上大学的克拉拉在大学医院担任病人护理助理，直到她说至少有十几名护士感染了冠状病毒，医院更换了人员，导致克拉拉失业。由于没有工资和账单要付，她决定在OnlyFans上开设一个账户，这是一个以自制色情作品闻名的网站。对于克拉拉来说，这几个月是忙碌的几个月，即使她脑海中有一个电视角色，她说管理这一切仍然是一个挑战。</p><p>    “I feel like I’m walking on a tightrope with being blindfolded while holding two pounds of oranges... No matter where I’m going, I’m either going to fall to the right or to the left, but I have to keep going straight,” she said.</p><p>“我觉得我拿着两磅橘子，被蒙上眼睛，走在钢丝上……。不管我去哪里，我要么向右倒下，要么向左倒下，但我必须一直往前走，“她说。</p><p> Clara is a first-generation American, the daughter of immigrants from Peru, and she’s determined to use what she describes as the skills God gave her — a good brain, the ability to work hard, and an ease with people — to make her parents proud and show people that she’s going somewhere. Sex work wasn’t part of her plan, but it’s helping her stay on the path to where she wants to go so long as she can just hold on to the oranges.</p><p>克拉拉是第一代美国人，来自秘鲁的移民的女儿，她决心用她所说的上帝赋予她的技能-聪明的头脑，努力工作的能力，以及与人相处的随和-让她的父母感到自豪，并向人们展示她要去某个地方。性工作不是她计划的一部分，但只要她能抓住橙子，它就能帮助她保持在通往她想去的地方的道路上。</p><p> “[I’m the kind of person] who thinks the whole world is watching, and what I’m doing with OnlyFans, in a way it’s true, said Clara. “It’s the future that holds me down, and then expectations, making sure I don’t disappoint anyone. What’s going to happen now? You know.”</p><p>克拉拉说：“(我是那种认为全世界都在看的人)，在某种程度上，我和Fans一起做的事情是真的。”“是未来让我沮丧，然后是期望，确保我不会让任何人失望。现在会发生什么呢？你知道的。“。</p><p> Stories of young women paying their way through school with sex work are nothing new, but in the seven months since the WHO declared the coronavirus to be a pandemic, online sex work — often left out of discussions of ride-hailing and food delivery apps — has become an increasingly mainstream facet of the gig economy, and people like Clara say the risks are worth it to keep themselves afloat.</p><p>年轻女性通过性工作支付学费的故事并不是什么新鲜事，但自从世卫组织宣布冠状病毒是一种流行病以来的七个月里，网络性工作-通常被排除在打车和送餐应用的讨论之外-已经成为零工经济越来越主流的一个方面，像克拉拉这样的人表示，为了维持自己的生存，风险是值得的。</p><p> “At the end of the day, nobody is paying my rent for me, nobody’s gonna pay my car insurance, my phone bill, my cat food. Nothing,” she said. “So I have to do it. And it’s been so helpful.”</p><p>“说到底，没人帮我付房租，没人付我的车险、电话费、猫粮。没什么，“她说。“所以我必须这么做。这对我们很有帮助。“。</p><p> In the spring, when cities across the country were cheering each night to celebrate healthcare workers as heroes, Michelle Bleimeyer was fired from her job as a home-care nurse.</p><p>今年春天，当全国各地的城市每晚都在欢呼庆祝医护人员成为英雄时，米歇尔·布莱梅尔(Michelle Bleimeyer)作为家庭护理护士的工作被解雇了。</p><p> Bleimeyer, 33, had been working for the family in western Massachusetts for about a year, caring for a 2-year-old with a chromosomal condition. She said she wasn’t exactly sure why she’d been fired, but the dynamic had changed when the child’s parents started working from home.</p><p>33岁的Bleimeyer已经在马萨诸塞州西部的这个家庭工作了大约一年，照顾一名患有染色体疾病的2岁儿童。她说，她不确定自己被解雇的确切原因，但当孩子的父母开始在家工作时，情况发生了变化。</p><p> “One was an office manager and the other was an accountant... I think that was part of the problem. I think they were both a little bit on edge from working from home, and that’s part of the reason why I got canned,” she said.</p><p>“一个是办公室经理，另一个是会计……。我认为这是问题的一部分。我想他们都因为在家工作而有点紧张，这也是我被解雇的部分原因。“她说。</p><p> Bleimeyer got her nursing degree in 2009, and said it was hard to find a job in the aftermath of the Great Recession. “I was panicking because my student loans were coming due, and I wound up really liking [home care],” she said.</p><p>Bleimeyer在2009年获得了护理学位，她说在大衰退之后很难找到工作。“我很恐慌，因为我的助学贷款就要到期了，结果我真的很喜欢(家庭护理)，”她说。</p><p>    Bleimeyer had also been enrolled in a master’s degree program in midwifery earlier this year, but failed a test around the same time she was fired. She was already struggling with depression and anxiety, so she decided it was time to take a break. She knew about OnlyFans from Twitter and decided to open an account when she realized the money she was getting from unemployment wasn’t enough to live on.</p><p>今年早些时候，Bleimeyer还注册了助产学硕士学位课程，但大约在她被解雇的同时，她没有通过一次考试。她已经在与抑郁和焦虑作斗争了，所以她决定是时候休息一下了。她从推特上知道了OnlyFans，当她意识到自己从失业中获得的钱不足以维持生活时，她决定开一个账户。</p><p> In many ways, this is how sex work has always functioned. “People who were not sex workers started using OnlyFans and became sex workers due to losing their other jobs during COVID-19. So, again you see sex work, as it often is, as a sort of gig of last resort for people,” said sex worker rights advocate Kate Zen. “This is the way it’s always been. Not just during this pandemic. For a lot of the people ... sex work is not necessarily their only occupation, or the main occupation even, it’s this emergency source of informal income that they can get when they’re in a bind.”</p><p>在许多方面，这就是性工作一直以来的运作方式。“在新冠肺炎期间，非性工作者开始只使用风扇，由于失去了其他工作，他们成为了性工作者。性工作者权利倡导者凯特·陈(Kate Zen)说：“所以，你再一次看到性工作，就像它经常做的那样，是人们最后的一种工作。”“一直以来都是这样。不仅仅是在这场大流行期间。对很多人来说...。性工作不一定是他们唯一的职业，甚至不一定是他们的主要职业，而是他们在困境中可以获得的这种非正式收入的紧急来源。“。</p><p> But OnlyFans, which has been around since 2016 and was a popular source of alternative income for porn performers and other sex workers before the pandemic, has grown rapidly as shutdowns force people to stay home and the US faces  massive unemployment. It has attracted mainstream attention from celebrities likes  Beyoncé and  Bella Thorne, and many more people like Bleimeyer and Clara who had not done sex work before.</p><p>但自2016年成立以来，OnlyFans一直是色情表演者和其他性工作者的热门替代收入来源，随着政府关门迫使人们留在家里，美国面临大规模失业，OnlyFans增长迅速。它吸引了碧昂斯和贝拉·索恩等名人的主流关注，也吸引了更多像布莱迈尔和克拉拉这样以前没有做过性工作的人的关注。</p><p> The site is a subscription platform that allows content creators to post paywalled photos and videos, chat with subscribers, and receive tips. While the content on the site is not all pornography, that is what it’s most well known for.</p><p>该网站是一个订阅平台，允许内容创建者发布付费照片和视频，与订阅者聊天，并接收提示。虽然该网站上的内容并不全是色情内容，但这是它最广为人知的地方。</p><p> Bleimeyer, who is unabashed and frank about the ups and downs in her life, said that so far the experience has been better than she expected. She posts lingerie photos, nudes, and some videos, and when she chats with subscribers through messages, she says they have been more polite than she expected.</p><p>Bleimeyer对自己生活中的起起落落毫不掩饰和坦率，她说，到目前为止，经历比她预期的要好。她发布内衣照片、裸照和一些视频，当她通过短信与订阅者聊天时，她说他们比她想象的更有礼貌。</p><p> “Actually they ask before they send their dick pics. It has been a very lovely experience,” she said. “That’s what I was most surprised by.”</p><p>“事实上，他们在发照片之前会先问一下。这是一次非常愉快的经历，“她说。“这是我最吃惊的地方。”</p><p> While the notion of sex work itself may be new to many users, Clara and others said posting on the site didn’t feel like a huge leap because the content is not that different from what they’re already posting on Twitter or Instagram.</p><p>虽然性工作的概念本身对许多用户来说可能是新的，但克拉拉和其他人表示，在网站上发布内容并不是一个巨大的飞跃，因为内容与他们已经在Twitter或Instagram上发布的内容没有太大不同。</p><p> Mia, 32, who was 8 months pregnant when she lost her job as a certified nursing assistant at a nursing home in South Carolina in April, said it seemed obvious to make money off the pictures she was already posting.</p><p>32岁的米娅今年4月失去了南卡罗来纳州一家疗养院注册护士助理的工作，当时她已经怀孕8个月。她说，从她已经发布的照片中赚钱似乎是显而易见的。</p><p> Mia, who asked to go by the name she uses on her OnlyFans account for privacy reasons, is not romantically involved with the baby’s father at this point, and she said she posts provocative pictures on Twitter or Instagram. “I guess to just garner attention and get people’s curiosity going, like ‘OK, I see what she’s doing over there,’” she said.</p><p>出于隐私原因，米娅在她的OnlyFans账户上要求使用她的名字，目前她并没有与婴儿的父亲发生浪漫关系，她说她会在Twitter或Instagram上发布挑衅性的照片。“我猜只是为了引起人们的注意，激发人们的好奇心，比如‘好吧，我看到她在那边做什么了，’”她说。</p><p>    Mia had some money saved, plus the stimulus money and her tax refund, and that was enough to survive on for a couple of months. But when she learned that a friend was making a lot of money on the platform, she figured: why not?</p><p>米娅存了一些钱，加上经济刺激资金和退税，这些钱足以维持几个月的生活。但当她得知一位朋友在这个平台上赚了很多钱时，她想：有何不可？</p><p> “I already post borderline explicit content on my social media, so why not get paid for it?” she said.</p><p>“我已经在我的社交媒体上发布了一些露骨的内容，为什么不付钱呢？”她说。</p><p> At a time of incredible financial precarity, some of the women who spoke to BuzzFeed News said that staying out of debt was also a priority. Student loan payments were  paused through September, but federal reserve officials  have warned for years that the level of student debt in the US,  which ballooned after the Great Recession, is unsustainable, and young women like Clara have taken that seriously.</p><p>在这个令人难以置信的金融早熟时期，一些接受BuzzFeed新闻采访的女性表示，远离债务也是优先事项。学生贷款支付一直暂停到9月份，但美联储官员多年来一直警告称，美国在大衰退后不断膨胀的学生债务水平是不可持续的，像克拉拉这样的年轻女性已经认真对待了这一点。</p><p> When Clara was unable to work at the hospital, she said people suggested she take out loans like other students, but she has heard horror stories from older nurses at the hospital about how much they’re still paying on loans, and she wants nothing to do with that.</p><p>克拉拉说，当克拉拉无法在医院工作时，人们建议她像其他学生一样申请贷款，但她从医院的年长护士那里听到了关于他们仍在偿还多少贷款的可怕故事，她不想参与这件事。</p><p> “As soon as I graduate, I’m going to owe so much more money than the original loan ... for a shitty apartment?” she said. She also said she would have a higher payment because of her parents’ poor credit, and that it just wasn’t worth it. “I’ve struggled financially my whole life and I don’t want the burden of, you know, trying to buy a house, and I’m like, ‘Aw shit, I have to pay my loan from five years ago.’”</p><p>“我一毕业，就会欠下比原来贷款多得多的钱……。就为了一间破烂的公寓？“。她说。她还说，由于她父母的信用不佳，她会得到更高的报酬，这根本不值得。“我一生都在经济上苦苦挣扎，我不想要，你知道，试图买房的负担，我就像，‘哦，该死，我必须偿还五年前的贷款。’”</p><p> Nikki, another nursing student who is based in Detroit and also asked to go by the name she uses on her OnlyFans account for privacy reasons, had a similar perspective.</p><p>另一名底特律护理专业的学生尼基(Nikki)也有类似的观点，出于隐私原因，她也被要求使用她在OnlyFans账户上的名字。</p><p> Nikki decided to go back to school for a nursing program in May, after dropping out of college a few years ago when she got injured in a lacrosse game. She said she’s always wanted to be a nurse, but the tuition fees are based on her father’s salary even though he’s not paying for school.</p><p>尼基在几年前因在一场曲棍球比赛中受伤而从大学辍学后，于5月份决定重返学校参加护理课程。她说，她一直想成为一名护士，但学费是根据她父亲的工资计算的，尽管他没有支付学费。</p><p> “I’ve heard nothing but bad things about student loans... I just don’t do the payments. I never have, I never really want to,” she said. “I think it’s stupid to pay extra for something I could just pay for now and pay less. Interest is crazy on school loans especially.”</p><p>“我只听说过关于助学贷款的坏事……。我只是不付钱。我从来没有，我从来没有真正想过，“她说。“我认为，多花点钱买一些我现在就能付得起的东西，而且花的钱更少，这是愚蠢的。”特别是在学校贷款上，利息是疯狂的。“。</p><p> Like other gig economy jobs, OnlyFans takes a cut of content creators’ pay — 20% — and offers no benefits to people making a living on the platform. But while many workers for companies like Uber and DoorDash said they had been  worse off during the pandemic, Nikki — who was working as an Uber driver before she started on OnlyFans — said making money from online sex work has made her life easier.</p><p>像其他零工经济工作一样，OnlyFans从内容创作者的薪酬中提成-20%-并且不向在该平台上谋生的人提供任何福利。但是，尽管优步(Uber)和DoorDash等公司的许多员工表示，他们在大流行期间情况更糟，但尼基(Nikki)-在开始使用OnlyFans之前，她是一名优步司机-表示，从网络性工作中赚钱让她的生活变得更容易。</p><p> Nikki enrolled in an accelerated nursing program this spring, and said managing the workload has been intense.</p><p>尼基今年春天报名参加了一个加速护理项目，她说管理工作量一直很紧张。</p><p> “I’m in an accelerated program on top of everything so I’m at a fast pace. It’s just so crazy to balance that and work,” she said. “It’s like four years in one...They just throw everything at you all at once. We were doing 4 chapters every class. We had two exams a week, it was just so much.”</p><p>“我正在进行一个加速项目，所以我的节奏很快。在工作和工作之间取得平衡实在是太疯狂了，“她说。“这就像是四年的时间……他们一下子把所有的东西都扔给了你。”我们每节课都要做4章。我们一周有两次考试，实在是太多了。“。</p><p> She said she prefers the work on OnlyFans because it gives her more time to study.</p><p>她说，她更喜欢OnlyFans上的工作，因为它让她有更多的时间学习。</p><p> “I’ve definitely not had to do Uber as much, so I’m home more, which helps with studying because I can study and be on OnlyFans at the same time,” she said. “I’m not out driving all the time. It’s easier just doing like one thing instead of being out and about all the time. It’s made my life a lot easier.”</p><p>她说：“我绝对没有那么频繁地使用优步，所以我更多地呆在家里，这有助于学习，因为我可以一边学习，一边使用OnlyFans。”“我不是一直在外面开车。只做一件事比整天在外游荡要容易得多。这让我的生活轻松多了。“。</p><p> Mia, similarly, said she’s using the money she makes on OnlyFans to supplement her savings while she pursues a nursing degree.</p><p>同样，米娅说，她正在用在OnlyFans上赚的钱来补充她在攻读护理学位期间的储蓄。</p><p> Mia decided to pursue work as a certified nursing assistant after caring for her grandfather, who had Alzheimer’s disease, and she had been doing the work for nine years before she was laid off in April.</p><p>在照顾患有阿尔茨海默氏症的祖父后，米娅决定从事认证护士助理的工作，在4月份被解雇之前，她已经做了9年的工作。</p><p> “I used to care for my grandad back in 2011. When he passed away, my boyfriend at the time was saying, ‘You know you could go to school for this type of stuff,’” she said. “I [was] basically trying to fill that void because I had spent almost two years every day taking care of him because he lived next door to me.”</p><p>“早在2011年，我就一直在照顾我的爷爷。当他去世时，我当时的男朋友说，‘你知道你可以去学校学这种东西，’“她说。“我基本上是在努力填补这一空白，因为我每天几乎花了两年时间照顾他，因为他住在我隔壁。”</p><p> She said she’s always wanted to pursue a nursing degree, but between work and family obligations there had never been enough time. Since she’s only working about two hours a day on OnlyFans right now, she’s using the extra time to enroll in a nursing program.</p><p>她说，她一直想攻读护理学位，但在工作和家庭责任之间，从来没有足够的时间。因为她现在每天只在OnlyFans上工作大约两个小时，所以她利用额外的时间参加了一个护理项目。</p><p> “The plan [now] is to go from CNA [certified nursing assistant] to LPN [licensed practical nurse] to RN [registered nurse]… you know, life got in the way, I had a couple of children, the work schedule can be demanding,” she said. “I’ve always wanted to be a nurse since I was a teenager, but never took the time to apply myself.”</p><p>“现在的计划是从cna(注册护士助理)到lpn(有执照的执业护士)，再到rn(注册护士)…。你知道，生活阻碍了我，我有几个孩子，工作日程可能要求很高，“她说。“我从十几岁起就一直想当一名护士，但从来没有花时间去应聘。”</p><p> While some of the  newcomers during the pandemic say they only plan to be on the site temporarily, Mia said she’s intending to stay on even after she gets her nursing degree.</p><p>虽然大流行期间的一些新来者表示，他们只计划暂时留在这个网站上，但米娅说，即使她获得了护理学位，她也打算留下来。</p><p> “I’m gonna continue doing it [once I get my LPN],” she said. “If I promote myself every day for a year, it has to get somewhere, it has to take off at some point. I want to see the earning potential behind it.”</p><p>“一旦我拿到LPN，我就会继续做下去，”她说。“如果我在一年的时间里每天都在推销自己，那就必须有所作为，总有一天会腾飞。我想看看它背后的盈利潜力。“。</p><p> The promotion work is no small task. OnlyFans doesn’t have a main page for viewers to discover new accounts to follow, so content creators must build a following and advertise through other social media accounts.</p><p>推广工作不是一件容易的事。OnlyFans没有让观众发现新账户的主页，所以内容创建者必须建立追随者，并通过其他社交媒体账户做广告。</p><p> Bleimeyer said she had picked up tips on how to use OnlyFans through groups on the encrypted chat app Telegram and in conversations on Twitter, and Nikki said she’s been learning online too.</p><p>Bleimeyer说，她已经通过加密聊天应用Telegram上的群组和Twitter上的对话获得了如何使用OnlyFans的提示，尼基说她也在网上学习。</p><p> Nikki has only been on the platform for a couple of weeks, and said she was nervous about what to post at first. Would it be too explicit? Not enough? Weird in some way? But she’s been googling and got the hang of it from watching other people’s accounts.</p><p>尼基在这个平台上只有几周的时间，她说她一开始很紧张该发布什么。会不会太露骨了？还不够吗？在某种程度上很奇怪吗？但她一直在谷歌上搜索，并从查看其他人的账户中掌握了诀窍。</p><p> “I honestly watch YouTube videos and I search the internet. It’s like studying,” said Nikki.</p><p>“老实说，我会看YouTube视频，还会上网搜索。这就像在学习，“尼基说。</p><p> She also joined Reddit groups and learned about financial domination, a sexual fetish where submissives give money or gifts to their master, on Twitter. She didn’t know anything about it, but it seemed like the best way to make money on OnlyFans, so she did some research.</p><p>她还加入了Reddit群组，并在Twitter上了解了金融统治，这是一种性恋物癖，顺从的人会给他们的主人钱或礼物。她对此一无所知，但这似乎是在OnlyFans上赚钱的最好方式，所以她做了一些研究。</p><p> She said it was a little strange at first, but she has 58 “slaves” now, and it’s paying off. “It’s worth it though. I mean, I’ll wake up some mornings and — this morning I woke up to a $100 Cash App just because,” she said, laughing in amazement. “That’s just one of my slaves. He pays me $100 every time he gets paid.”</p><p>她说，一开始有点奇怪，但现在她有58个“奴隶”，而且这是有回报的。“不过，这是值得的。我的意思是，我会在某些早晨醒来--今天早上我醒来时发现了一款100美元的现金应用，只是因为，“她惊讶地笑着说。“那只是我的一个奴隶。他每次拿到工资都付给我100美元。“</p><p> The influx of newcomers to OnlyFans has created issues for more experienced sex workers who were already using the platform, or who joined after in-person work  became untenable in the spring. Referral bonuses  were cut in May because so many new users had joined, and rates for pay-per-view messages and tips  were capped in August.</p><p>OnlyFans的新来者的涌入给已经在使用该平台的更有经验的性工作者，或者在春季面对面工作变得难以为继后加入的性工作者带来了问题。由于有如此多的新用户加入，推荐奖金在5月份被削减，按次付费信息和小费的费率在8月份受到限制。</p><p> The changes have led to  growing suspicion that a platform made popular by sex workers is  once again abandoning them. But Zen said most of the experienced sex workers she had spoken with were still able to make good money on the platform despite their misgivings, and were primarily worried that the growing attention to the platform would lead to attempts by sex work abolitionists — who often frame their arguments in terms of the anti–sex trafficking movement — to shut it down. One woman, Zen said, told her “she feels like it’s only a matter of time before the anti-trafficking bandwagon is going to jump on it. So, her main concern is ‘How do I make as much money as I can on this platform that’s being good to me right now before the bubble bursts and it becomes bad again?’”</p><p>这些变化让人们越来越怀疑，一个由性工作者流行起来的平台正在再次抛弃她们。但Zen表示，与她交谈过的大多数有经验的性工作者，尽管心存疑虑，但仍然能够在这个平台上赚到很多钱，他们主要担心，对该平台的日益关注会导致性工作废奴主义者试图关闭该平台-他们的论点经常被框定为反性交易运动。禅宗说，一名妇女告诉她：“她觉得反人口贩运的潮流会加入进来只是个时间问题。因此，她主要关心的是‘我如何在这个泡沫破裂之前对我有利的平台上赚到尽可能多的钱，然后它又变得糟糕了？’“。</p><p> While the increasing numbers of people using OnlyFans indicates some degree of widespread acceptance for online sex work, the work is still heavily stigmatized, and Heather Berg, an assistant professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said the increased visibility of the platform has also produced a backlash.</p><p>虽然使用OnlyFans的人数不断增加，表明网上性工作在一定程度上得到了广泛接受，但这项工作仍然被严重污蔑，圣路易斯华盛顿大学(Washington University)助理教授希瑟·伯格(Heather Berg)表示，该平台知名度的提高也引发了反弹。</p><p> “The expected answer is that OnlyFans is mainstreaming, and I think that&#39;s partially true,” Berg told BuzzFeed News via email in response to a question about growing acceptance of the platform. “But increased visibility has brought intensified pushback as much as it has more mainstream acceptance. We&#39;re seeing increased online harassment from incels and concern trolling from anti-sex worker feminists and conservatives.”</p><p>“预期的答案是，OnlyFans正在成为主流，我认为这部分是正确的，”伯格通过电子邮件告诉BuzzFeed新闻，回答有关该平台越来越多的接受程度的问题。“但知名度的提高带来了更强烈的抵制，因为它得到了更多的主流接受。我们看到，来自Incels的网络骚扰越来越多，来自反性工作者、女权主义者和保守派的担忧也在不断增加。</p><p> Bleimeyer said she had faced harassment online before she started the OnlyFans account, but that it’s gotten significantly worse.</p><p>Bleimeyer说，在她开设OnlyFans账户之前，她曾在网上遭遇过骚扰，但现在情况变得明显更糟了。</p><p> “It’s different than just being a woman online, because that’s its own special harassment,” said Bleimeyer. “You’re more quickly discounted, you’re just written off immediately to some people.”</p><p>Bleimeyer说：“这不同于仅仅在网上做一个女性，因为这本身就是一种特殊的骚扰。”“你很快就会打折，有些人会马上把你打折。”</p><p>  “It makes me really mad,” said Clara. As a patient care assistant, she said, “I’ve seen people die, I’ve seen people not being able to breathe. I’ve seen coworkers wondering when we’re going to have more people working because the workload has gotten so bad … I&#39;ve seen it all, and it’s just insane when people try to bring me down, saying like, ‘Oh why are you talking, you know nothing.’ And it’s actually like, ‘Dude, I do.’ I know a lot.”</p><p>“这让我很生气，”克拉拉说。作为一名病人护理助理，她说：“我看到人们死去，我看到人们无法呼吸。我看到同事们在想，我们什么时候才能有更多的人工作，因为工作量变得如此之大。这一切我都看过了，当人们试图让我失望时，他们会说，‘哦，你为什么要说话，你什么都不知道。’这简直是疯了。实际上就像是，‘伙计，我喜欢。’我知道的很多。“。</p><p> While Bleimeyer is open about her work on OnlyFans — “If I’m going to be a midwife, it’s kind of along the same lines” — the other women who spoke to BuzzFeed News said they felt they had to keep at least some elements of their work a secret because they feared judgment or  consequences at work.</p><p>虽然Bleimeyer对她在OnlyFans上的工作是公开的--“如果我要当助产士，那也差不多”--但接受BuzzFeed新闻采访的其他女性表示，她们觉得自己必须至少对工作中的某些内容保密，因为她们担心工作中的评判或后果。</p><p> “Going into nursing and OnlyFans is not really a great mix. You can get in trouble for that,” Nikki said, adding that she believed it was possible to lose your license. “I’m very wary about it. I don’t want to ever lose my license if I go to school and pay all this money.”</p><p>“进入护理行业和只做粉丝并不是一个很好的组合。你会为此惹上麻烦的，“尼基说，并补充说她认为有可能会被吊销驾照。“我对此非常谨慎。如果我去上学，付了这么多钱，我可不想被吊销驾照。“。</p><p> For Clara, the experience has created a distance with her classmates that she said is hard to overcome. “I feel isolated from a lot of the students. I feel that if they were to find out — a lot of them do know, and they’re OK with it — but I feel like if other people know, they’re going to get a bad idea of me.”</p><p>对克拉拉来说，这段经历造成了她与同学之间的距离，她说这很难克服。“我觉得自己和很多学生是隔绝的。我觉得如果他们发现了--很多人都知道，他们也没意见--但我觉得如果其他人知道了，他们会对我产生不好的印象。“。</p><p> Zen said it was too early to tell whether the growing numbers of online sex workers will mean anything for sex worker rights. She also cautioned that such discussions in the context of OnlyFans are limited because they focus on a legal form of sex work, but she thought it was hopeful that people were using the term “sex worker” more openly.</p><p>Zen说，现在断言越来越多的网络性工作者是否会对性工作者的权利有任何意义还为时过早。她还告诫说，在OnlyFans的背景下，这样的讨论是有限的，因为他们关注的是一种合法形式的性工作，但她认为人们更公开地使用“性工作者”这个词是有希望的。</p><p> Clara has gone back to work in the hospital again and was doing sex work alongside her work as a patient care assistant, but she tested positive for COVID-19 after working with a patient who had it last week and is stuck at home again while she and her boyfriend recover.</p><p>克拉拉再次回到医院工作，在担任患者护理助理的同时还在做性工作，但在上周与一名患者共事后，她的新冠肺炎检测呈阳性，在她和男友康复期间，她再次被困在家里。</p><p>  “Just because I’m someone who’s basically a cam girl doesn’t mean that I deserve less than anybody else. People have to stop being so judgmental. We’re in hard times right now. The way people choose to support themselves is their own business,” she said.</p><p>“仅仅因为我是一个基本上是一个摄像机女孩的人，并不意味着我比其他任何人都配得上更少的东西。人们不能再这么吹毛求疵了。我们现在正处于困难时期。人们选择的养活自己的方式是他们自己的事，“她说。</p><p> “If it’s not hurting you, then why is it such a big deal?” ●</p><p>“如果它没有伤害到你，那为什么这有什么大不了的呢？”</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/otilliasteadman/pandemic-nurses-onlyfans-sex-work">https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/otilliasteadman/pandemic-nurses-onlyfans-sex-work</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/护士/">#护士</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/nurses/">#nurses</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
