Vermont (213- VERMONT or 837-6668) came into existence sometimes in the late 1960&#39;s. The Machine (213-833-3339) came next, and then Zzzzzz (213-836-5566), officially it started with six Z&#39;s. Zzzzzz was also listed as &#34;A&#34; in the phone book. It had started out not with the intent of playing material over the phone, but of having the first and last listing in the directory.</p><p>  在L.A.地区，Ben＆＃39; S乐观留言是早期更好的知名的消息之一。佛蒙特州（213-佛蒙特州或837-6668）有时在1960年代后期进入存在。该机器（213-833-3339）接下来，然后ZZZZZZ（213-836-5566），正式启动六z＆＃39; s。 ZZZZZZ也被列为＆＃34; A＆＃34;在电话簿中。它始于通过电话播放材料的意图，而是在目录中拥有第一个和最后一个列表。</p><p> Vermont and The Machine both used multi-message formats. Eachtime someone called, they had a chance of hearing a different message.</p><p> 佛蒙特州和机器都使用多留言格式。每次有人打电话，他们有机会听到不同的信息。 </p><p> Sometime after Zzzzzz started receiving calls from curious soulswondering what the phone listing was about, they began playingmessages.

This number did not have the same calling area as the other two. This one was in the Hollywood rate. By then the recordings were rarely changed. I heard that it was in a closet somewhere in Reseda.</p><p>        Mark Robbins，IRA Goldstein，Ben Weinberg和Jan Lucas位于Reseda 881-2345，然后更改为990-5653，最后在大规模电话前缀（520）上，所有无线电站都有他们的请求号码，520-9646。这个数字没有与另外两个相同的呼叫区域。这一个是好莱坞率。到那时录音很少发生变化。我听说它在Reseda的某个地方是一个壁橱。</p><p> I would guess that it  started around 1970. A friend, Raymond Childs told me about it while in summer school. He found out about it from a poster on a phone pole. These where the first recordings that I heard.</p><p> 我猜它始于1970年底。一位朋友，雷蒙德的孩子在暑期学校告诉我。他从电话杆上的海报中找到了它。这些我听到的第一个录音的地方。</p><p> Mark Robbins and Ira Goldstein were living in an apartment on Yarmouth Street in Encino, California. Jan Lucas and Ben Weinberg were visiting. They were listening to a radio skit called Dial-A-Dirty-Joke. The light bulb went off in their minds. Let&#39;s start &#34;Dial-A-Joke&#34; where people can call a telephone number and get a joke.</p><p> Mark Robbins和Ira Goldstein居住在加利福尼亚州恩南·埃拉姆茅斯街的公寓里。 Jan Lucas和Ben Weinberg正在访问。他们正在听一个名为Dial-A-Dirty-笑话的无线电话。灯泡在他们的脑海里走了出去。让＆＃39; s开始＆＃34;拨号-a-joke＆＃34;人们可以拨打电话号码并开玩笑。 </p><p> We decided that Jan Lucas would be the voice of Dial-A-Joke, Mark Robbins would be responsible for building and maintaining the answering machine (later to be the custom Dial-A-Joke machine). Ira Goldstein and Ben Weinberg were responsible for content and production of the Dial-A-Joke tapes.</p><p>我们决定Jan Lucas将是拨号笑话的声音，Mark Robbins将负责建设和维护答案机（后来是定制拨号机器）。 IRA Goldstein和Ben Weinberg负责拨号录音带的内容和生产。</p><p> So we hooked up a telephone company answering machine. I believe that it was a Code-A-Phone 770 (it was illegal to hook up anything else in those days) and recorded a joke. As I recall, it was: You have dialed Dial-A-Joke Two Chickens was talking. The first chicken said &#34;The farmer gets 50 cents a dozen for my eggs&#34;. The second chicken said &#34;Well, the farmer gets 55 cents a dozen for my eggs and my eggs are bigger&#34;. The first chicken says &#34;I should bust my ass for a lousy nickel? You have dialed Dial-A-Joke&#34;</p><p> 所以我们联系了一台电话公司的电话。我相信这是一个代码-手机770（在那些日子里挂钩的其他任何东西是违法的）并录制了一个笑话。正如我回忆起，它是：你已经拨打了拨号笑话两只鸡正在谈论。第一个鸡说＆＃34;农民为我的蛋和＃34变十几个十几个;第二个鸡话说＆＃34;嗯，农民为我的鸡蛋获得55美分，我的鸡蛋更大＆＃34;第一只鸡肉说＆＃34;我应该为糟糕的镍摧毁我的屁股？您已拨号-A-joke＆＃34;</p><p> We also got a rubber stamp made that said &#34;Dial-A-Joke 881-2345&#34; and stamped hundreds of business card sized pieces of paper and then passed them out in the local malls.</p><p> 我们还有一个橡皮戳，称＆＃34;拨号-a-joke 881-2345＆＃34;并盖上数百个名片大小的纸张，然后在当地商场传递它们。</p><p> Immediately, we started receiving back to back calls and Code-A-Phone started to fail under the load. It was clear that we needed a more durable solution. Mark&#34;s solution was an 8 track tape player. About 30 different jokes were recorded on a mobious loop tape (8 track tape). There were two tracks recorded on the tape. The first track had the joke on it. The second track had a beep tone after each joke which turned off the machine. We also put a counter on the machine. When we retired the machine, it had over a million calls logged.</p><p> 立即，我们立即开始收到返回呼叫，代码-A手机在负载下开始失败。很明显，我们需要更耐用的解决方案。 Mark＆＃34; S解决方案是8个轨道磁带播放器。在剧烈的环形胶带上记录大约30个不同的笑话（8个轨迹胶带）。磁带上有两条曲目记录。第一条赛道上有笑话。在每个笑话关闭机器后，第二次曲目有一个哔声。我们还在机器上放了一个柜台。当我们退出机器时，它会记录超过一百万个呼叫。</p><p> Almost immediately after Dial-A-Joke started, the Pacific Bell telephone exchange was overloaded with calls. Most people were getting a busy signal but quickly discovered that they could talk to each other in the silence between busy signals. The phone company called us and told us that we would need to increase our phone lines from one to 30. A special interface box between our equipment and the phone line was required to be rented from the phone company for $30 each. That would have put us out of business so we created a recording asking listeners to come down to the phone company for a rally. We alerted the press and both radio and television were going to cover the event. We received a call from the local Pacific Bell executive who wanted to meet with us. He came over to our apartment and we had a friend picking up the phone and holding the handset up to a tape player to play the caller a joke (remember it was illegal to connect directly to the phone line). We negotiated three phone lines (instead of 30) with him and we were allowed to connect our machines directly to the phone line. In return, we issued a retraction telling callers not to show up at the rally. Pacific Bell was ready the morning of the rally. They served donuts, juice and coffee for anyone that happened to show up.</p><p> 几乎在拨号笑话开始后立即，太平洋钟电话交换机被呼叫过载。大多数人都获得了忙碌的信号，但很快发现他们可以在忙碌信号之间的沉默中互相交谈。该手机公司呼吁我们并告诉我们，我们需要将我们的电话线从一到30增加。我们的设备和电话线之间的特殊接口盒是需要30美元的电话公司租用。这将使我们失业，所以我们创建了一份录音，要求听众归功于电话公司。我们提醒了新闻界，广播电视和电视都将覆盖该活动。我们收到了来自当地太平洋贝尔高管的电话，他们想与我们见面。他来到了我们的公寓，我们有一个朋友拿起电话，并将手机拿到录像带播放唱片笑话（记住直接连接到电话线是非法的）。我们与他协商三条电话线（而不是30），我们被允许直接将我们的机器连接到电话线。作为回归，我们发出了一项撤退，告诉呼叫者不要在集会上出现。太平洋钟就准备好了一点反弹。他们为遇到展现出现的任何人服用甜甜圈，果汁和咖啡。</p><p> On Friday nights, a group of friends came to our apartment and we recorded jokes. On Saturday nights we answered live and met lots of people. Mark met his long time girlfriend Bonnie Cordova on Dial-A-Joke and thereafter his wife Cassandra.</p><p> 星期五晚上，一群朋友来到我们的公寓，我们录得笑话。星期六晚上，我们回答了生活，遇到了很多人。马克在拨号笑话上遇到了长时间的女朋友Bonnie Cordova，然后他的妻子Cassandra。</p><p> Dial-A-Joke was dissolved when Mark and Ira moved out of their apartment. After Mark moved to Denver in the mid 70&#39;s he met Robert Moore and they took the original Dial-A-Joke machine out of moth balls and put it into service for a short time. I dont remember the number.</p><p> 当马克和伊拉搬出他们的公寓时，拨号笑话被解散了。在70年代中期，马克搬到了丹佛之后，他遇到了罗伯特摩尔，他们从蛾球中取出了原始的拨号笑话机，并将其投入到短时间内。我不记得这个号码。 </p><p> The link between Dial-A-Joke 881-2345 and Z, ZZ, ZZZ: My mother wanted to see what Dial-A-Joke was all about. She dialed 981-2345 instead of 881-2345 and reached Joe Klein who was the production manager of Z, ZZ, ZZZ.

After that the recordings where rarely changed. Al Bernay made fun of some of the recordings on his line. The playback equipment was still located in the Reseda area after the phone number change. I heard it was locked up in a closet.</p><p>           在最后一组记录之后，数字更改为群众呼叫前缀520（520-9646或520-Yoho）。之后，很少改变的录音。 Al Bernay在他的线上取笑了一些录音。在电话号码更改后，播放设备仍然位于Reseda区域。我听说它被锁在衣柜里。</p><p>  Run by Mt.

In 1973, Woz was working for Hewlett-Packard. His Dial-A-Joke service got more than 2,000 calls a day. He rented answeringequipment from the phone company and often used a telephone lineman&#39;s handset to take calls live from his tiny kitchen in Cupertino or while lying on the mattress in his bedroom. Extremely shy, Woz didn&#39;t have much of a chance totalk to women, but he met his first wife, Alice Robertson, when she called Dial-A-Joke. Robertson heard a man say,  &#34;I bet I can hang up faster than you&#34; - and then he did. Naturally, she called back. A more elegantobject-poem on the nature of modern romance is hard to imagine. There had been so many calls that he had to keep changing the number. Anyone with a similar number would get 100 calls a day. Steve operated Dial-a-Jokeout of his Cupertino apartment.</p><p>  斯蒂夫·沃佐克255-6666或575-1625经营二十年前，斯蒂芬加里·沃兹尼亚克拥有旧金山湾区的第一个拨号服务。 1973年，沃兹为惠普工作。他的拨号服务每天拨打超过2,000个电话。他租用了电话公司的回答机会，经常使用电话线＆＃39;手机从Cupertino的小厨房或在卧室躺在床垫上拍摄。非常害羞，Woz nidn＆＃39; t有很多机会划分给女性，但他遇到了他的第一任妻子，阿丽斯罗伯逊，她称之为拨号笑话。 Robertson听到一个男人说，＆＃34;我打赌我可以比你更快地挂断。 - 然后他做到了。当然，她回电话了。一个更典雅的对象 - 诗歌的现代浪漫性质很难想象。有很多电话，他必须继续改变这个数字。任何相似的人每天都会得到100个电话。史蒂夫经营的Cupertino Apartment的拨号A-A-Jokeout。</p><p> Steve used a thick Eastern accent, like Russian, and used the name Stanley Zebrezuskinitsky when he took live calls.</p><p> 史蒂夫使用了一个厚厚的东部口音，就像俄罗斯一样，并在乘坐直到电脑时使用名字斯坦利Zebrezuskinitsky。</p><p>  Run by James Wayman    Located in DesMoines Iowa, then Crescent City California   976-Joke, then 1-707-487-Joke   Started in 1986 In 1986 James Wayman started the second 976# in the state of Iowa.

Very quickly thenRobin, Holly, Lewis , Jerry, Paul, Mike, Mike (two of them). Still later add Carl and Jose. The Machine was once disconnected for frying the step-by-step equipment itwas on. Having peaked at more than 2,000 calls in one day on a single line ina residential connector group, you can imagine. A worried switch man saidthat, of eight local connectors serving the phone numbers which were then213-833-33XX, one was almost always connected to The Machine. One was almostalways broken because of the high volume. At least half of the rest weredialing in or listening to a busy signal. Sometime after that, it re-emerged with a different number. 213-833-2405. Forabout one year, it operated with 5 lines in rotary. Later, when the 833prefix was moved from step to ESS#5, The Machine moved back to 833-3339. The Machine operated on a variety of other numbers, including 213-836-5556(selected to be in the miss-dialing shadow for Zzzzzz), and 714-833-3339 and213-822-2329 among them. All of these were considered satellite numbers tothe &#34;The Machine Telephone Entertainment Network&#34;.

I may even have the original recordings some place. The old tapes from the mainline were on 4-track and were lost many years ago due to water damage.</p><p> 这里是一个跑马林线的一个人（6/2/2006）：这是由我的一位非常亲密的朋友经营的，Mike Levey.in事实只是去年我实际上将旧的主线设备设置在垃圾桶里在过去的25岁+年后储存它。我甚至可能有一些地方的录音。来自主线的旧胶带在4轨道上，多年前因水损坏而丧失。</p><p> The system used Altec line amplifiers to connect to the phone line, it was illegal back then to hook anything to the phone line so we were kind of skirting the law. A home made breadboard was used to sense ringing and connect the line to the amplifiers and turn on the tape. The tape machines were 4 track type made by Telex with foil sensors for EOT.</p><p> 系统使用ALTEC线放大器连接到电话线，它是非法的，然后将任何东西挂在电话线上，所以我们有点偷偷地。家庭制造的面包板用于感测振铃并将线路连接到放大器并打开磁带。胶带机是通过电传为EOT的箔传感器进行的4型轨道类型。</p><p> We only had 3 lines in rotary and they were always busy. Now and then we would put an old Code-a-phone answering machine on it and hear what people thought about it and where they were from.

It is a shame that your recordings are of such poor quality, all of the originals were done on 15 ips 2 track tapes in a real recording studio in Hollywood, and the quality was perfect.</p><p>迈克是InfoMercial Fame，是一个开始主线的人之一，它是他当时的妻子，你在许多录音中听到了性感的Bimbo。令人遗憾的是，您的录音质量如此差，所有原件都在好莱坞的真正录音室中的15个IPS 2轨迹磁带上完成，质量完美。</p><p> The Mainline was actually built as a prototype to sell to places like MacDonald&#39;s and Jack in the Box. The plan was that we would place a machine at each of the stores and supply them with fresh material on a monthly basis with a short advertisement at the end for the company. It was getting a bit of interest but for some reason no one wanted to be the first one so we gave up on it and all went our separate ways. I had hosted it at my house for a year at 213-783-8738 (back when Encino was 213) for a year before I finally shut it down and stored it in the garage. By then the material was getting old and no one had the time to go play in the studio.</p><p> 主线实际上是作为原型的原型，以销售给麦克唐纳港等地方。该计划是我们将在每家商店放置一台机器，并每月用新鲜的物料供应新鲜材料，并为公司结束时提供短广告。它得到了一些兴趣，但由于某种原因，没有人想成为第一个，所以我们放弃了它，所有人都是我们的独立方式。在我终于将其关闭并将其存放在车库之前，我在213-783-8738（当时收到了213）时，我在我家举办了一年（回来的时候）一年（回到213）。那么，材料变老了，没有人有时间在工作室里玩。</p><p> Mike who started it went on to infomercial fame with his show Amazing Discoveries and Ask Mike, and did very well for himself.
