How much previous generations had to think about it, be around it, even handle it.</p><p>  从字面上看，排泄物。前几代人必须考虑，解决甚至解决它的问题。</p><p> Before the automobile, horses flooded the streets, and cities were mired in their muck. According to  Richard Rhodes’s  Energy: A Human History, in New York City, horses dropped 4 million pounds of manure and 100 thousand gallons of urine on the streets every  day. (!) And in   The Rise and Fall of American Growth, Robert Gordon quotes this passage from  The Horse in the City:</p><p> 在汽车出现之前，马匹淹没了街道，城市陷入泥潭。根据理查德·罗兹（Richard Rhodes）的《能源：人类历史》，在纽约市，马匹每天在街上掉下400万磅的粪便和10万加仑的尿液。 （！）在《美国成长的兴衰》中，罗伯特·戈登（Robert Gordon）引用了《马在城市》中的这段话：</p><p> The smell of manure heaps and the clouds of flies they attracted were some of the most objectionable nuisances stables created. The nuisance was especially bad in the summer…. On New York’s Liberty Street there was a manure heap seven feet high. New York streets … were often covered with layers of manure.</p><p> 肥料堆的气味和它们吸引的苍蝇云是一些最令人讨厌的讨厌马s。夏季的滋扰尤为严重……。在纽约的自由街上，有一个七英尺高的肥料堆。纽约街头……经常被肥料覆盖。</p><p> Shoveling shit was literally a full-time job. And one of the key uses of horses was to pull the wagons that carried away horse droppings.</p><p> 铲屎实际上是一项全职工作。马的主要用途之一是拉开带走马粪的马车。</p><p> But excrement wasn’t just something to be cleared away. Oh no, that would be a profligate waste! Shit was valuable. It was a  treasure. It was  gold.</p><p> 但是排泄不仅仅是要清除的东西。哦，不，那将是挥霍无度的浪费！狗屎很有价值。那是宝。那是金。</p><p>  For thousands of years, manure, mainly from livestock, was the primary way to renew the fertility of the soil after each harvest. Agricultural systems were defined in large part by how much manure they could effectively use on arable land. The transition from slash-and-burn to the two-field rotation of antiquity depended on livestock that would graze in pasture, then be penned in on fallow fields at night to fertilize it with their droppings. The transition to the three-field rotation depended on the plow, which among other things allowed manure to be buried under the soil; and the wagon, which allowed more manure to be transported.</p><p>  几千年来，主要来自牲畜的粪便是每次收获后恢复土壤肥力的主要方式。农业系统的主要定义是可以在耕地上有效使用多少肥料。从刀耕火种到古代两场轮换的过渡取决于牲畜，这些牲畜会在牧场上放牧，然后在晚上被闲置在休耕地上，以随其粪便施肥。向三场旋转的过渡取决于犁，除其他因素外，犁还使肥料被埋在土壤下。货车，这可以运输更多的肥料。 </p><p> Dung was also used as fuel, in areas that didn’t have much firewood, and even as a building material. The poorest areas today still burn dung for fuel, contributing to indoor air pollution:</p><p>粪便还用作燃料，在薪柴不多的地区甚至用作建筑材料。今天最贫穷的地区仍然燃烧粪便作为燃料，造成了室内空气污染：</p><p>  By the 1800s, the manure trade had gone global. The Chincha Islands, off the coast of Peru, where it rarely rained, had been accumulating seagull droppings for thousands of years. The accumulated guano, stories high, was mined like coal or lime and exported to Europe and the US. A description and picture of guano mining, from Rhodes’s  Energy:</p><p>  到1800年代，肥料贸易已经走向全球。在秘鲁沿海很少下雨的钦查群岛，数千年来一直积聚着海鸥的粪便。堆积的鸟粪层高，像煤炭或石灰一样开采，并出口到欧洲和美国。罗得岛的能源对鸟粪开采的描述和图片：</p><p> Working with pickaxes from the shore inward and the top down, the miners created Dover-like yellowish cliffs that looked from a distance like dirty snow. One German observer compared them to “a dark platter on which an enormous yellow cheese is being cut.” A survey conducted in 1854 concluded that the original mass of guano on the three islands had totaled no less than 13 million short tons (11.4 million metric tons), under hills covered with what one investigator calls “a dazzling coat of guano glass,” a crust of calcium phosphate. Another 1854 observer found the guano surface “like light dry earth and full of holes” that the birds scraped out for nesting and shelter. The surface was “difficult to walk upon, there being no certainty that every other footstep will not sink in nearly to the knee.” A few feet below the surface, the guano “became compact,” however, “and from thence through its whole thickness, it is of nearly the consistence of Castile soap.”</p><p> 这些矿工使用从海岸向内和自上而下的镐，创造了多佛（Dover）般的淡黄色悬崖，从远处看起来像是肮脏的雪。一位德国观察家将它们比作“一块深色的盘子，上面刻着巨大的黄色奶酪”。 1854年进行的一项调查得出的结论是，在三个岛上，鸟粪的原始总量总计不少于1300万短吨（1140万吨），在一个被调查人员称为“令人眼花guan乱的鸟粪玻璃外衣”的山丘上。磷酸钙的外壳。另一位1854年的观察者发现鸟粪表面“像一块轻干的土壤，到处都是孔”，它们被鸟刮去筑巢和庇护。表面“很难行走，无法确定其他脚步不会沉到膝盖附近。”在表面以下几英尺处，“鸟粪”变得“紧凑”，“因此，从整个厚度来看，它几乎都是卡斯蒂利亚肥皂的成分。”</p><p>  The demand for fertilizer was so great that the islands quickly reached Peak Dung, and were exhausted in about 40 years. The need was so acutely felt that multiple commentators of the 1800s criticized  city sewers because they did not capture human waste for reuse. Sir William Crookes, in  an 1898 speech, praised “the treasure locked up in the sewage and drainage of our towns” (!), lamented the “unspeakable waste” of “recklessly returning to the sea what we have taken from the land,” and pondered “converting sewage into corn.” The 1902 Yearbook of the US Department of Agriculture also  refers to “the vast waste of nitrogenous material that is involved in modern sewage methods. Millions of dollars’ worth of nitrogen which would naturally return to the soil… is every year carried off in various waterways….” In  Les Miserables, Hugo  laments the same thing during his digression on the Paris sewers. “To employ the city to enrich the plain would be a sure success. If our gold is manure, on the other, our manure is gold.… A sewer is a mistake.”</p><p>  对肥料的需求是如此之大，以至于这些岛屿很快就到达了峰粪，并在大约40年中耗尽了。如此强烈的需求使1800年代的多位评论员批评了城市下水道，因为他们没有捕获人类的废物用于再利用。威廉·克鲁克斯爵士（Sir William Crookes）爵士在1898年的演讲中称赞“锁在我们城镇污水和排水系统中的宝藏”（！），对“鲁re地将我们从陆地上夺回的海物归还大海”的“无法言喻的浪费”表示遗憾。并思考“将污水转化为玉米”。美国农业部的1902年年鉴也提到“现代污水处理方法中所含的大量含氮物质的浪费。数百万美元的氮会自然返回土壤……每年在各种水道中被带走……”在《悲惨世界》中，雨果在离题巴黎下水道的过程中感叹了同样的事情。 “雇用这座城市来丰富平原将确保成功。如果我们的黄金是粪便，另一方面，我们的粪便就是黄金。……下水道是一个错误。”</p><p> Indeed, not all the waste from the city was lost! Horse manure was carted back to the farms, as was some human waste, known as “night soil”. Collecting this stuff must have been a terrible job, but one John Hunt was proud enough to print this fancy calling card:</p><p> 确实，并不是所有的城市浪费都流失了！马粪和一些人类废物也被运回农场，这些废物被称为“夜土”。收集这些东西肯定是一件可怕的工作，但是约翰·亨特（John Hunt）自豪地打印出了这张精美的电话卡：</p><p>  Night soil is still used in poor countries. In her  memoir of life in North Korea, Yeonmi Park recalls her government “poop quota”:</p><p>  穷国仍在使用夜土壤。 Yeonmi Park在她的朝鲜人生回忆录中回顾了她的政府“船尾配额”：</p><p> One of the big problems in North Korea was a fertilizer shortage. When the economy collapsed in the 1990s, the Soviet Union stopped sending fertilizer to us and our own factories stopped producing it. Whatever was donated from other countries couldn’t get to the farms because the transportation system had also broken down. This led to crop failures that made the famine even worse. So the government came up with a campaign to fill the fertilizer gap with a local and renewable source: human and animal waste. Every worker and schoolchild had a quota to fill. You can imagine what kind of problems this created for our families. Every member of the household had a daily assignment, so when we got up in the morning, it was like a war. My aunts were the most competitive.</p><p> 朝鲜最大的问题之一是化肥短缺。 1990年代经济崩溃时，苏联停止向我们提供肥料，而我们自己的工厂也停止生产肥料。其他国家捐赠的任何东西都无法送到农场，因为运输系统也已经崩溃。这导致农作物歉收，使饥荒更加严重。因此，政府提出了一项运动，以填补本地和可再生资源：人畜废物的肥料缺口。每个工人和小学生都有配额。您可以想象这给我们的家庭带来什么样的问题。每个家庭成员都有每天的工作，所以当我们早上起来时，就像一场战争。我的阿姨们竞争最激烈。 </p><p>  “Remember not to poop in school!” my aunt in Kowon told me every day. “Wait to do it here!”</p><p>“记住不要在学校大便！”我每天在姑姑的姑姑告诉我“等一下！”</p><p>  Whenever my aunt in Songnam-ri traveled away from home and had to poop somewhere else, she loudly complained that she didn’t have a plastic bag with her to save it. “Next time I’ll remember!” she would say. Thankfully, she never actually did this.</p><p>  每当我在松南里的姨妈出门离开而不得不在其他地方大便时，她都会大声抱怨自己没有塑料袋来保存。 “下次我会记得！”她会说。值得庆幸的是，她从未真正这样做过。</p><p>  The big effort to collect waste peaked in January, so it could be ready for growing season. Our bathrooms in North Korea were usually far away from the house, so you had to be careful that the neighbors didn’t steal from you at night. Some people would lock up their outhouses to keep the poop thieves away. At school the teachers would send us out into the streets to find poop and carry it back to class. So if we saw a dog pooping in the street, it was like gold. My uncle in Kowon had a big dog who made a big poop—and everyone in the family would fight over it.</p><p>  收集废物的最大努力在一月份达到顶峰，因此可以为生长季节做好准备。我们在朝鲜的浴室通常离房子很远，因此您必须小心，不要在晚上被邻居偷走。有些人会锁上厕所，以防止便便小偷离开。在学校，老师们会将我们送到街上寻找大便，然后将其带回课堂。因此，如果我们看到一条狗在街上大便，那就像金子。我在Kowon的叔叔养了一只大狗，大便成年，家里的每个人都会为之争斗。</p><p> In sum, excrement played a major role in life before the 20th century. It was literally a crappy world.</p><p> 总之，排泄在20世纪之前的生活中起着重要作用。从字面上看，这真是个app脚的世界。</p><p> How did we get out of this shitty situation? A few key inventions of the early 1900s:  synthetic fertilizer, which released us from bondage to manure; and motorized transport—first electric streetcars, then automobiles—which ended (in Gordon’s phrase) “the tyranny of the horse”.</p><p> 我们如何摆脱这种糟糕的局面？ 1900年代初期的一些重要发明：合成肥料，使我们从奴役变成了肥料；以及机动运输工具（首先是电动有轨电车，然后是汽车），以“马的暴政”结束（用戈登的话来说）。</p><p> The adoption of both of these, I’m sure, was hastened by  the new germ theory and the scientific realization that feces were a vector for disease. Rhodes writes houseflies, which live on dung, were long regarded as merry companions, until public health messaging changed their image:</p><p> 我敢肯定，新细菌理论和粪便是疾病的传染媒介的科学认识促进了这两种方法的采用。罗德（Rhodes）写的生活在粪便上的家蝇，长期以来一直被视为快乐的伴侣，直到公共卫生消息传递改变了他们的形象：</p><p> Urban sanitary science in the last years of the nineteenth century, newly informed of the invisible vectors of disease, focused on filth as a signifier, flies in particular. Before then, flies had been considered charming and benevolent at best, useful scavengers at worst. “Our common houseflies seem jocund with mirth,” an observer wrote playfully in 1859, “while they chase one another and dance their giddy rounds in the sunbeams.” By the end of the century, reports a historian of public health, the fly had been “transformed from a friendly domestic insect into a threat to health and hearth…. Its dangers were exaggerated so that at times it became as certain a killer as the mosquito that spread yellow fever and malaria. Health officials sought to develop the idea of germs into a practical and comprehensible weapon against disease. To do this, they portrayed flies as germs with legs.” And flies, of course, luxuriated in horse manure; their larvae fed on it. The head of the US Department of Agriculture’s Bureau of Entomology estimated in 1895 that the ubiquitous manure of horses bred 95 percent of all America’s flies.</p><p> 十九世纪最后几年的城市卫生科学特别了解了疾病的无形传播媒介，其中以污秽为代表。在此之前，果蝇充其量被认为是迷人和仁慈的，最坏的时候被认为是有用的拾荒者。一位观察家在1859年嬉戏地写道：“我们共同的家蝇看起来像欢腾似的，而他们彼此追逐并在阳光下跳舞。”到本世纪末，据一位公共卫生史学家报道，果蝇已经“从一种友好的家养昆虫转变为对健康和壁炉的威胁……”。它的危险被夸大了，以致它有时像传播黄热病和疟疾的蚊子一样成为杀手。卫生官员试图将细菌的观念发展成一种实用且可理解的抗疾病武器。为此，他们将苍蝇描绘成腿上的细菌。”当然，苍蝇在马粪中繁茂。他们的幼虫以它为食。美国农业部昆虫局局长在1895年估计，马粪无处不在，饲养了95％的美国苍蝇。 </p><p> Bottom line: The fact that excrement is hidden and flushed away from our daily lives—rarely seen, touched or smelled—is not the normal state of human existence. It is a great achievement of the modern world.</p><p>底线：事实是，粪便被隐藏和冲离了我们的日常生活-很少见到，摸不到或闻到了-这不是人类生存的正常状态。 这是现代世界的一项伟大成就。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://rootsofprogress.org/when-life-was-literally-full-of-crap">https://rootsofprogress.org/when-life-was-literally-full-of-crap</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/生活/">#生活</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/literally/">#literally</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/肥料/">#肥料</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
