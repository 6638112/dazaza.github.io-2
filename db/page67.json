"note_en": "I used to use   Roam every day, but I don\u2019t use it much anymore. Based on what I can see on Twitter, and a casual survey of friends, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone.\n A year ago, the idea of networking our notes with bi-directional links became the biggest thing in the tools for thought space since Vannevar Bush described the  memex. Top-down hierarchies and tag systems became the  pet explanation du jour for everything that was wrong with note-taking. So we all hustled on to the Double-Bracket Express determined to build our own networked knowledge graphs. But where did we actually go? At least for me\u2014and most of the people I know\u2014we got a garbage dump full of crufty links and pieces of text we hardly ever revisit. And we feel guilty and sad about it.\n   (It is a very appealing looking garbage dump, however.)  There are probably a host of reasons why this happened: Roam\u2019s product velocity seems to be incredibly slow, there still isn\u2019t really a good mobile experience, they\u2019ve had well-documented community issues\u2014the list goes on.\n But there\u2019s one main reason that I don\u2019t use it anymore:\n When I write my notes the thought, \u2018Where am I going to put this? \u2019 plagues me every time. It\u2019s a direct and immediate pain. And it sometimes gets in the way of me even taking notes at all. I have this sensation many times a day and it\u2019s deeply uncomfortable.\n Roam\u2019s job was to get rid of that pain. And it did\u2014for a while. But now it\u2019s back.\n  The core idea that caught on with Roam is the concept of a bidirectional link. Previous note-taking systems allowed linking in only one direction: you could link from one note to another, but the note being linked to had no automatic link back to the original note.\n Bi-directional linking, by contrast, creates a link from the first note to the second, and from the second to the first automatically. Roam made this extremely easy to accomplish\u2014just by typing pieces of your notes in [[ brackets ]] you could link between notes, and even create new ones if the note you were linking to didn\u2019t already exist.\n The idea was to create a highly-networked system of notes with lots of links between them. By doing so, you could increase serendipitous encounters with old notes, and decrease your risk of losing a note, and generally get more out of the whole note-taking experience, or indeed life itself:\n  I believed that if I used it, I\u2019d learn more from my experiences because I wouldn\u2019t forget them. I\u2019d take away more lessons from the books I\u2019d read because I\u2019d always have them close at hand. I\u2019d make better decisions, produce better writing, and maybe my hair would even start to look as lustrous as Conor\u2019s.\u00a0     (Side-by-side comparison. How am I doing on the hair part?)There\u2019s a ton of intelligence and deep thought behind Roam\u2019s design. But did it actually work for me?  Not really. If I plotted out the percent of my time writing bidirectional links vs. actually looking at my notes and clicking through the links in them, this is what I estimate it would look like:\n  It turns out that I am rarely in a position, while writing or thinking, where I want to glance through lots of old notes as a way to figure out what to say or do. Mostly that feels like sifting through stale garbage.\u00a0  My most common behavior is to Actually Write the Notes. That\u2019s why Roam needs to help me with the thought, \u2018I don\u2019t know where to put this. \u2019 If it does that well, it makes the vast majority of my time spent in the app a breeze. If it does that poorly, it makes my experience so painful that I want to switch systems.\n The genius of bi-directional linking is that when I first started to use it, the neurotic hamster in my head decided to turn down the volume knob on the \u2018Where should I put this? \u2019 question.\n Why? Bidirectional linking is a very good story. Roam\u2019s job is to make me believe that if I just surround pieces of my notes like this [[ ]] I won\u2019t really have to worry about finding the note again. It\u2019s now networked! The need to take notes far outstripped the need to review them (see: graph above), so Roam solved my problem.\n After some time though, reality started to sink in. \u2018I am not really going back through all of these notes as often as I thought I would. \u2019 My next automatic assumption is that if they were just organized better I might go through them more. And so, the question starts to creep in again. \u2018Where should I put this? \u2019\n Once I\u2019m back to thinking this way, all sorts of other problems that I have with Roam start to creep in. \u2018Where is the mobile app?\u2019 And, \u2018why doesn\u2019t it feel like the product is improving? And, \u2018why does everything feel like a mess?\u2019  All of these problems were present, but none were important so long as I believed Roam was solving my core issue. But now that it\u2019s not,  suddenly, point-solution alternatives like Apple Notes and Things start to feel appealing. And the whole thing unravels.\n I used to use Roam for lots of things: a daily diary, book notes, keeping track of lists like my todo list, and taking meeting notes.\n   The whole thing moved away from Roam because I started to worry again about where to put things.\n This might seem trivial, or useless, or reductive. But it is actually quite valuable. If we&#39;re really using Roam to regulate the emotional experience of not knowing where to put a note, then that suggests a lot of product changes Roam could make to perform better at that job.\n   The easiest way for Roam to fix this would be to improve\u00a0 the search function...\n Want to read the rest of this post and the hundreds of other essays and interviews on Every?

"note_en": "While the rifle may not pack the punch of a traditional firearm, a review of the ArcFlash Labs GR-1 shows why it is not a toy.\n  A video review appeared online yesterday for the ArcFlash Labs GR-1, an electromagnetic Gauss rifle that surfaced last year when its manufacturer began taking pre-orders from the general public. We did a story about it then  which you can read here. While the largely 3D-printed battery-powered rifle may at first glance appear to be almost toy-like, the review makes it clear that it is anything but.\n The full video can be  found on YouTube and was made by small arms expert Ian McCollum, who is a researcher for  Armament Research Services and runs the popular blog  Forgotten Weapons, the latter of which focuses on obscure, experimental, and prototype small arms. In the review of the GR-1, he walks through the Gauss rifle\u2019s features and capabilities before taking it to a range for target shooting.\n  In a Forgotten Weapons  blog post accompanying the video review, McCollum writes that the term \u2018rifle\u2019 is technically a misnomer in this case. Rifles are typically defined as having a spiraling (or helical) pattern of grooves cut into the inner wall of their barrels. The GR-1 is technically a  smoothbore, as its barrel is smooth and lacks these grooves.\n The GR-1 was first  listed for pre-sale in August 2021 and was described as the \u201cworld\u2019s first and only handheld Gauss rifle.\u201d At the time, the price was listed as $3,375, which still appears to be the case according to  the rifle\u2019s website. The weapon uses a series of electrified coils to generate a magnetic field that accelerates  ferromagnetic, or iron-rich, metal slugs with diameters under half an inch to speeds up to 75 meters per second, or 240 feet per second. The GR-1 feeds ammunition from a magazine that can hold up to 10 such slugs.\n   ArcFlash says the GR-1 features an \u201cadvanced capacitor charging system\u201d that allows its 25v lithium-ion battery to rapidly charge the coils, allowing the \u2018rifle\u2019 to fire at full charge approximately every three seconds, and more rapidly at weaker charge levels. The weapon&#39;s trigger system allows users to pre-charge the coils with a half-pull on the trigger before firing it with a complete pull.\n   The rifle\u2019s stock, magazines, and battery holder are 3D-printed, while some sections appear to be acrylic plastic that has been bolted on. A small LCD screen displays the charge of the weapon\u2019s battery, the charge of its capacitors, coil temperature, and \u201cpost-shot diagnostics,\u201d according to  its manual. Check out our  prior coverage of the GR-1 for a full description of this &#34;mass accelerator&#34; weapon and its features.\n   The majority of the video review of the Gauss rifle walks viewers through its design, features, and how to operate the unconventional gun. Portions of the footage demonstrate of how to load magazines, change and charge the GR-1\u2019s batteries, and how to adjust the desired energy of the coils.\n   McCollum also points out the addition of a built-in flashlight, green targeting laser, and a sliding rear stock that allows three different lengths of magazines to be inserted, each accommodating different sizes of slugs. By pulling a lock ring on the top of the rifle, the rear portion of the gun can be extended or shortened, changing the size of the receiver and therefore what size of magazine can be inserted.\n   The review points out several important safety features unique to the Gauss rifle such as making sure the battery is removed whenever not in use, and that due to the magnetic charge the GR-1\u2019s coils produce, the rifle should not be used within 50 feet of anyone with a pacemaker or similarly sensitive medical device.\n When on the range, McCollum demonstrates the GR-1 firing at a variety of energy levels. The Gauss rifle is surprisingly quiet when discharging, only producing a faint whine while charging and a mechanical \u2018click\u2019 whenever a round is fired.\n   At a few points during the video demonstration ( roughly 19:15) the GR-1 misfires, forcing McCollum to have to tilt the rifle forward to allow the unfired round to fall out of the barrel. The reviewer states this is likely caused by feed issues that appear when the rifle\u2019s magazine is close to empty. \u201cThe future can\u2019t solve all of our problems, can it?\u201d McCollum jokingly asks.\n After a round damaged the wooden stand holding up the targets used in the review, McCollum points out that this shows how the GR-1 is capable of inflicting real damage. \u201cThis is a serious weapon,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cYes, in terms of energy numbers, the muzzle energy is wimpy compared to a firearm, but this is absolutely potentially lethal, so it does need to be treated with the respect that one accords a proper firearm,\u201d he says.\n    When examining his target after testfiring the GR-1, McCollum found that some of the rounds tended to tumble in flight, likely due to the lack of rifling in the weapon\u2019s barrel and low muzzle velocity. The grouping of hits on the target is fairly tight, though, indicating the Gauss rifle is fairly precise at least at the relatively close distances at which it was tested in the review.\n   While the GR-1 drew a few jeers when it first appeared last year, Forgotten Weapons\u2019 review makes it clear that the Gauss rifle is indeed a lathal weapon, albeit an unconventional one. The review also drives home the fact that the GR-1, at least the specific one used in the review, is very much a prototype and still rough around the edges. Between the occasional misfires, the somewhat rough finish of the 3D printed stock, and the seemingly cobbled-together components, the concept is far from what one would consider a normal mass production item, at least in its tested form.\n Still, for around $3,375, the GR-1 sure would make for an interesting conversation piece at the range.", "posttime": "2022-02-15 03:12:09",

"note_en": "About half of the contiguous US is  currently\u00a0experiencing moderate to extreme drought\u2014including almost all of the West. That shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, as widely pervasive drought has been present for quite a while now in this region, where major reservoirs like Lake Powell and Lake Mead are hovering around all-time low-water levels. But how does this ongoing drought compare to the past? After all, the region is no stranger to dry stretches.\n A  2020 paper examined the 2000-2018 data in the context of a tree ring reconstruction going back to the year 800 and stretching from Southern California to Wyoming. That team found that this was likely the second-driest period in the record, beat out only by a megadrought in the late 1500s.\n At the time, the paper&#39;s authors guessed that good precipitation in 2019 would be enough to end the extended drought. But instead, a particularly wicked 2021 kept the drought alive. As a result, three of those researchers\u2014UCLA\u2019s  Park Williams and NASA\u2019s  Benjamin Cook and  Jason Smerdon\u2014decided to update the numbers through 2021.\n  The term \u201cmegadrought\u201d isn\u2019t some sensationalist moniker from bad television; it&#39;s a term for the handful of two- to three-decade Southwestern droughts in the past millennium or so\u2014some with history-defining impacts on the civilizations who lived there at the time.\n With the analysis updated, 2000-2021 ranks as the driest such 22-year period in the data going back to the year 800. The megadrought years of 1571-1592 slip into second place. (Though the error bars on the two periods overlap.)\n  Between 2000 and 2021, 18 of those years saw soil moisture below the long-term average. Only two past megadroughts meet that level of consistent dryness. The years 2002 and 2021 rank as the 11th and 12th driest years in the whole record\u2014and it has been three centuries since a drier year occurred. And although some megadroughts were focused in a particular region, the drought of the last two decades has been widespread across the West. That\u2019s what you would expect to see from a drought driven more by global warming than by precipitation patterns.\n To estimate the contribution of climate change, the researchers repeated their analysis of climate models run with and without warming temperatures. Their previous work had estimated that 46 percent of the severity of the 2000-2018 drought was due to human-caused warming. For 2000-2021, they get a similar answer of 42 percent despite using a new generation of climate model simulations.\n  This drought isn\u2019t the result of strong trends in precipitation but rather the impacts of higher temperatures. A warmer atmosphere can evaporate more moisture from the land while also decreasing the storage of mountain snowpack that feeds Western rivers in the summer months.\n The researchers say that the current drought is likely to extend through the end of this year, after which point it would equal the length of the shortest megadroughts at 23 years. (The longest were 30 years.) That isn\u2019t a hunch based on our weather outlook; it&#39;s a statistical calculation. The researchers copied a rolling 40-year window of years from the past drought reconstruction and pasted each of them onto the end of 2021 for plausible samples of near-future weather. The current drought reaches 23 years in 94 percent of those stitched-together timelines and hits 30 years in 75 percent of them.\n Odds are good that by the end of 2022, the current drought could inarguably be classified among the historical megadroughts, absent some extremely fortuitous precipitation.\n The researchers write, \u201cPrevious work indicated that continued [anthropogenic climate change] will increasingly enhance the odds of long, widespread, and severe megadroughts returning to [Southwest North America] after a hiatus of &gt;400 [years]. After the driest 22-year period in at least 1,200 [years], which included two of the driest 12 individual years in at least 1,200 [years], this worst-case scenario already appears to be coming to pass.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-02-15 03:09:47", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,hitting,\u6301\u7eed", "title":

"note_en": "Ethereum layer-2 solution, Optimism, fixed a major flaw that would have permitted an illegal and continuous creation of ETH tokens.\n According to   sources , Optimism might have just solved a significant system vulnerability issue. The potential glitch got the attention of developers at   Ethereum  through an Ethical Hacker, Jay Freeman, who discovered flaws in the code and saved the network from significant theft risks.\n The bug, now curtailed, was reportedly   triggered by an Etherscan employee. Had the issue not been promptly resolved, malicious users on the chain could have exploited the flaw. This means a cyber actor could have gained access to the unlimited generation of fresh ETH tokens.\n In a comprehensive blog post, Jay   described  precisely how this vulnerability could lead to the infinite duplication of the second most-valued cryptocurrency in the world. He explained that any developer on Ethereum\u2019s chain could automatically use one of its forks to create new tokens. Specifically, a continuous regeneration is triggered by running a SELF-DESTRUCT opcode command on a smart contract that once held ETH tokens.\n   Luckily, Optimism restored the integrity of the network by fixing the bug on time before it exploited it. After receiving word about the issue, the development team implemented a fix on Kovan testnet and Optimism Mainnet in a matter of hours. Additionally, other affiliated forks and bridges to Optimism were alerted of the defect. So, as of now, Optimism and other related Ethereum projects are bug-proof.\n Following the bug\u2019s swift resolution, Optimism swiftly rewarded whistleblower Jay Freeman, an amount of $2 million. The recent award makes Freeman\u2019s bounty one of the highest ever recorded. However, a reasonable reward when one considers how much could have been lost had a malicious party caught on with the glitch. Additionally, the bonus gives developers an incentive to report code inconsistencies instead of exploiting them for selfish ends.\n  Besides Optimism, other layer-2 rollups have been reported to suffer from technical weaknesses. December saw a popular scaling solution; Polygon  silently tackled a bug that   exposed  92% of MATIC tokens to malevolent parties. Luckily, two ethical hackers stepped up to notify the network and were rewarded $1.75 million each. A few months earlier, a whitehat hacker reported and identified a loophole that could have cost Polygon a billion dollars. Last week saw Ethereum bridge, Wormhole,   lose  more than $325 million.\n Layer-2 solutions have introduced significant scaling improvements amidst numerous benefits for users (such as reduced transaction fees). However, recent incidents hint that it might be at the cost of some security concerns.\n Of late, several DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) are taking proactive approaches to curb glitches. Offering bounties to Whitehats to identify and report security loops remain a practical approach to salvage potential glitches in a smart contract.", "posttime": "2022-02-15 03:07:47",

Doom. SRB2 is closely inspired by the original Sonic games from the Sega Genesis, and attempts to recreate the design in 3D. While SRB2 isn&#39;t fully completed, it already features tons of levels, enemies, speed, and quite a lot of the fun that the original Sonic games provided.\n Download and experience Sonic Robo Blast 2  today!     Releases ::  Development ::  Website ::  Other ::  Archive  Hello everybody! Round 2 of this year\u2019s contest is among the best ones ever. There are so many great maps in the compilations.\n The winner of the single player division is Mikhael Blur with his entry, Bricked Busted Zone. This massive zone with solid platforming has music borrowed from our very own CobaltBW. The bright colors and architecture of the block castles look very nice. Congratulations!\n  Mikhael Blur also won the Capture the Flag division with his entry, Colorful Towers Zone, which shares Bricked Busted\u2019s theming. The winner of the Match division is Dieg\u00e3o with their entry, Marble Acropolis Zone. InferNOr won the Battle Arena division with their entry, Misty Gardens Zone. Congratulations!\n  You can view the full contest results  here. If you haven\u2019t checked out this contest pack yet, you can download it  here.\n Thanks to everyone who participated in this contest!  The deadline for OLDC 2022 Round 1 is  June 1st, 2022 at 23:59 UTC (6:59 EST). See you then!\n  The  Official Level Design Contest is back!

Check it out!\n  Be aware that in SRB2 v2.2.9, there are some visual errors with the character swappers. These issues are fixed in the upcoming patch, v2.2.10. Other various bugs are present in some of the submitted maps. Patches for these maps are likely coming sometime in early January. For now, we\u2019ve eliminated every soft lock and crash we could find, so the pack should be pretty stable.\n Please submit your votes before   January 16th, 2022 @ 6:59 PM EST (23:59 UTC). Thanks to all our contestants, and have fun!\n  Hello everybody! Round 1 of this year\u2019s contest has been a great success. Let\u2019s see the results!\n The winners of the single player division are Othius, Inazuma, and Spectorious with their entry, Hollow Hill Zone. This mysterious place is full of strange liquid. Players can climb up streams of it by jumping up. One section of the level has a very cool shrine that collapses. The stage has fun slopes to spin off of and nice custom assets to look at. Congratulations, all three of you!\n   Congratulations to MK.exe for winning the Match division with Uncharted Badlands Zone! Congratulations to Ruberjig and Apollyon Woman for winning the Battle CTF division with Metallic Madness Zone!\n  You can view the full contest results  here.

The deadline for OLDC 2021 Round 2 is  December 1st, 2021 at 23:59 UTC (6:59 EST). See you then!\n  It\u2019s that time again, folks! Well, rather, two days ago was that time again \u2014 I\u2019m late to post this. But that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t still that time! That\u2019s right,  the Official Level Design Contest is back for another exciting installment! Come on down and experience some brand-new, never-before-seen maps! We\u2019ve got  single player maps, we\u2019ve got  match maps, and we\u2019ve got  battle CTF maps, totaling 23 entries by 22 creators! What wonders await in the mysterious asteroid base? Who will win the trophy for each game type? Are you a bad enough dude to  vote for your favorite maps? I sure hope you are, and  if you are, then  click right here to get started!\n  Phew\u2026ahem. Now that the sales pitch is out of the way, I\u2019d like to highlight some quality-of-life features new to this iteration of the OLDC. Here\u2019s what our contest staff has whipped up:\n Press &amp; hold the Fire button in single player mode to return to the hub\n At the time of writing, we advise players not to use the return to hub function while standing close to a star post unless they would like to spawn in an erroneous location upon their return. There are a couple other minor bugs with the new features that contest staff are working to fix, and we hope to push said fixes soon.\n Be sure to submit your votes before   June 26th, 2021 @ 6:59 PM EST (23:59 UTC). Thanks to all our contestants, and may the best maps win!\n  Hello everybody! Thanks to community feedback, we were able to find and fix some major errors preventing players from properly enjoying the game on Android devices.  If you were getting nothing but a black screen in OpenGL mode, this could be the patch for you! The  changelog is short, so I\u2019ll copy the whole thing:\n Fix the user being able to open the console in situations where it should not open\n  Hey. 2.2.9\u2019s out. Grab it at  the usual place. It\u2019s late, so I\u2019ll just paraphrase some of the more interesting lines from  the changelog:\n Fixed an error when loading addons with custom savedata via the command line (notably, when testing from Zone Builder).\n   Added multitag library for Lua, which allows reading and manipulation of tags on mapthings, lines and sectors; also added tag iterator functions.\n        Pausing the game is no longer possible during the score tally screen in Marathon Mode.\n  Added acronym keywords to Co-op levels. For use with the map command, so e.g. you can warp to Green Flower 1 with map GFZ1.\n  Fixed an issue with the installer executables where you wouldn\u2019t always be asked where you want to install the game.\n There are lots of bug fixes and other quality-of-life things in this patch. We hope you enjoy it.\n  After over a decade, the SRB2 Message Board is finally upgraded to a modern interface. Gone are the days of the broken ratings system. No more shall we have to deal with a subpar experience on mobile browsers. We\u2019re back, and we\u2019re better than ever. We greatly appreciate your patience with us during the migration process.\n We hope you like the new  Addons &amp; More system. There\u2019s way too much to say about it for a single news post, so check out the  instructions on how to submit files to it as well as these  answers to some questions about it you probably have. If your addon somehow didn\u2019t make it into Addons &amp; More, please let us know!\n \u201cSo, what other new features are on the new message board?\u201d you might ask. First, one of the more obvious features: the ability to react to posts. Just click the \u201cCool!\u201d button at the bottom of a post to let the post author know you like it. (It doesn\u2019t do anything else, but they might get a notification for it, which could give them warm and fuzzy feelings.)\n You now have the ability to set a banner that displays on your profile and on the profile preview that appears if someone hovers over your profile picture. If you\u2019re not sure what to set it to, may I suggest a screenshot of your favorite map?\n Another fun feature is native support for emoji. Click the smiley face in the post editor to browse available emoji. There\u2019s a text box in it to make searching for emoji easier. We added some custom ones that you might recognize from our Discord server.\n We\u2019ve also added an extension for the code block BBcode that lets you denote what language your code uses as well as highlight any lines you want. The code language is set to Lua by default, and several more languages are available.\n There are a bunch of new styles to pick from, including ones for every character in SRB2, with more on the way. The style selector is still on the bottom left of every page, just like the old forum.\n Contest winners will now see their wins displayed on their profiles. These trophies are part of the badges system. We will continue adding badges for every OLDC, but any other new badges will be few and far between. Winners of the most recent contest will also get a yellow banner under their name instead of a yellow username. With all these styles, we decided it\u2019s best to keep all usernames the same color.\n Finally, here\u2019s a big one: you can now install the SRB2MB on your PC or mobile device as a web app. As far as I know, it only supports Android and Windows 10. The Install button should be on the top navigation bar or on the bottom of the side navigation bar if you\u2019re on mobile. Opera doesn\u2019t always seem to show the Install button, so try Chrome or another browser if you don\u2019t see it. (No, it\u2019s not on the Play store, silly goose!) The web app looks and feels identical to the website, and you can access the SRB2 home page and the wiki through it. Now our community can always be just a tap away!\n There is one small caveat: we still need to copy over info from v2.1 and v2.0 era addons so you can see which of them are reusable. This will take a while, so please bear with us!\n Well, that\u2019s pretty much everything. I probably forgot a couple of minor things, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find them eventually. I sincerely hope you all find the new message board to be an improvement. We\u2019ve certainly done our best to meet that goal. If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or suggestions, please feel free to make a post in the Talk to the Staff subforum \u2014 we\u2019d love to hear it.\n I\u2019d like to close by extending my gratitude to everyone involved with the migration: AlamGBC, Alice, Boinciel, Charybdizs, D00D64, Inazuma, jameds, Larz T, LoganA, RoyKirbs, SteelT, and Varren. You guys are all wonderful!\n  Happy Valentine\u2019s Day! We at Sonic Team Junior love our playerbase so much that we\u2019re doing two cool things:\n We\u2019re giving you a prerelease build of v2.2.9. Find it on our Discord server!\n We are finally migrating to the new message board software. In under 24 hours, the process will begin, and the message board will go down for maintenance. Goodbye, vBulletin! Hello, Xenforo!\n As always, thanks for sticking around and playing SRB2! We wouldn\u2019t be where we are without you!\n  Hello everybody! The Autumn 2020 OLDC has come and gone. Before I congratulate the winners, I would like to go over some changes we will be making for future contests.\n The biggest change is that future contests will be twice per year instead of four times per year. We recognize that creating maps is harder and takes longer than it did when the OLDC was first created. We hope that giving mappers six months instead of three months to work on maps will result in more maps submitted to each contest, and that the maps are as high quality as the mappers can manage.\n In addition,  we will now require participants to include their Discord tag in their map submission posts (that is, your username \u2014 NOT a nickname \u2014 and the four numbers after it). This way, we can add participants to a special channel on the SRB2 Official Discord Server dedicated to answering their questions about the contest. This channel can also be used to keep contest staff up to date on fixes to your maps after the submission deadline has passed. We hope this will be easier than sending direct messages to contest staff regarding such topics, since individual staff members are not always online and/or available to help. (You may skip this if you do not have a Discord account, however.)\n  The winners of the single player division are Kwiin and Kanna with their entry, Foliage Furnace Zone. The map\u2019s theme appears to be borrowed from another fangame called  Sonic: After the Sequel. I found this map somewhat challenging. Watch out for death pits and fast-moving platforms! It uses slopes in ways that feel very much at home in a Sonic game, and its texture work is good. Congratulations, Kwiin and Kanna!\n   Congratulations to Joe Mewstard for winning the Circuit division with Electric Avenue Zone! Congratulations to Krabs for winning the Battle Arena division with Stupid Facestabber Zone, as well as winning the Battle CTF division with GFZFLR01 Zone!\n  You can view the full contest results  here. If you haven\u2019t checked out this contest pack yet, you can download it  here.\n Thanks to everyone who participated in this contest!  The deadline for OLDC 2021 Round 1 is June 1st, 2021 at 23:59 UTC (6:59 EST). See you then!\n  Hello everybody! I have good news and bad news. The bad news is that our message board will be going down for maintenance this weekend (December 26th &amp; 27th, 2020). The good news is that  this maintenance involves moving the message board to a new server. This should mean more stability, which is a much needed step in the process of upgrading to the new message board software.\n Please be aware that this means the ingame server browser will not be functional during this time. The best way to work around this is to join our Discord server. The place is never empty, and it\u2019s a great way to find people to play netgames with.\n Since this is on such short notice, we have decided to extend the OLDC voting deadline by one week.  Please cast your votes by January 2nd, 2021, 6:59pm EST (11:59pm UTC).\n  Older Posts \u00bb", "posttime": "2022-02-15 02:57:31", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News",

Then, it all went bang, giving rise to the  atoms, molecules, stars and  galaxies we see today.\n  Or at least, that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been told by physicists for the past several decades.\n  But new theoretical physics research has recently revealed a possible window into the very early universe, showing that it may not be &#34;very early&#34; after all. Instead it may be just the latest iteration of a bang-bounce cycle that has been going on for \u2026 well, at least once, and possibly forever.\n   Of course, before physicists decide to toss out the  Big Bang in favor of a bang-bounce cycle, these theoretical predictions will need to survive an onslaught of observation tests.\n   Scientists have a really good picture of the very early universe, something we know and love as the   Big Bang theory. In this model, a long time ago the universe was far smaller, far hotter and far denser than it is today. In that early inferno 13.8 billion years ago, all the elements that make us what we are were formed in the span of about a dozen minutes.\n  Even earlier, this thinking goes, at some point our entire universe \u2014 all the stars, all the galaxies, all the everything \u2014 was the size of a peach and had a temperature of over a quadrillion degrees.\n Amazingly, this fantastical story holds up to all current observations. Astronomers have done everything from observing the leftover   electromagnetic radiation from the young universe to measuring the abundance of the lightest elements and found that they all line up with what the Big Bang predicts. As far as we can tell, this is an accurate portrait of our early universe.\n But as good as it is, we know that the Big Bang picture is not complete \u2014 there&#39;s a puzzle piece missing, and that piece is the earliest moments of the universe itself.\n    The problem is that the physics that we use to understand the early universe (a wonderfully complicated mishmash of general   relativity and high-energy particle physics) can take us only so far before breaking down. As we try to push deeper and deeper into the first moments of our cosmos, the math gets harder and harder to solve, all the way to the point where it just \u2026 quits.\n The main sign that we have terrain yet to be explored is the presence of a &#34;singularity,&#34; or a point of infinite density, at the beginning of the Big Bang. Taken at face value, this tells us that at one point, the universe was crammed into an infinitely tiny, infinitely dense point. This is obviously absurd, and what it really tells us is that we need new physics to solve this problem \u2014 our current toolkit just isn&#39;t good enough.\n  To save the day we need some new physics, something that is capable of handling gravity and the other forces, combined, at ultrahigh energies. And that&#39;s exactly what string theory claims to be: a model of physics that is capable of handling gravity and the other forces, combined, at ultrahigh energies. Which means that string theory claims it can explain the earliest moments of the universe.\n One of the earliest string theory notions is the &#34;ekpyrotic&#34; universe, which comes from the Greek word for &#34;conflagration,&#34; or fire. In this scenario, what we know as the Big Bang was sparked by something else happening before it \u2014 the Big Bang was not a beginning, but one part of a larger process.\n Extending the ekpyrotic concept has led to a theory, again motivated by string theory, called cyclic cosmology. I suppose that, technically, the idea of the universe continually repeating itself is thousands of years old and predates physics, but   string theory gave the idea firm mathematical grounding. The cyclic universe goes about exactly as you might imagine, continually bouncing between big bangs and big crunches, potentially for eternity back in time and for eternity into the future.\n  As cool as this sounds, early versions of the cyclic model had difficulty matching observations \u2014 which is a major deal when you&#39;re trying to do science and not just telling stories around the campfire.\n The main hurdle was agreeing with our observations of the cosmic microwave background, the fossil light leftover from when the universe was only 380,000 years old. While we can&#39;t see directly past that wall of light, if you start theoretically tinkering with the physics of the infant cosmos, you affect that afterglow light pattern.\n  But the ekpyrotic torch has been kept lit over the years; and in a paper published in March 2020 in the journal  Physical Review D, researchers explore the wrinkles in the   mathematics and uncovered some previously missed opportunities. The physicists, Robert Brandenberger and Ziwei Wang of McGill University in Canada, found that in the moment of the &#34;bounce,&#34; when our universe shrinks to an incredibly small point and returns to a Big Bang state, it&#39;s possible to line everything up to get the proper observationally tested result.\n In other words, the complicated (and, admittedly, poorly understood) physics of this critical epoch may indeed allow for a radically revised view of our time and place in the cosmos.\n But to fully test this model, we&#39;ll have to wait for a new generation of cosmology experiments, so let&#39;s wait to break out the ekpyrotic champagne.\n   For a general overview of the Big Bang theory, check out &#34;  Your Place in the Universe &#34; by Paul M. Sutter, which covers the history of the development of the theory alongside the history of the universe itself. The PBS Spacetime video series has   a great video exploring the options for what may have caused the Big Bang.   Another video, published by the Simons Foundation, features physicist Paul Steinhardt explaining the Big Bounce idea.\n  Weinberg, S. &#34;Gravitation and Cosmology: Principles and Applications of the General Theory of Relativity,&#34; Wiley &amp; Sons, 1972.   https://www.amazon.com/Gravitation-Cosmology-Principles-Applications-Relativity/dp/0471925675\n Paul M.

"note_en": "First released on August 12, 1981, MS-DOS became the foundation for business computing for almost two decades.MS-DOS stood for Microsoft Disk Operating System and was often referred to simply as \u201cDOS\u201d.It is the software that helped build Microsoft, becoming the foundation Microsoft built the Windows operating system on.It went through 8 (and a half-ish) major revisions, with the final version being shipped with Windows ME in September, 2000.Before I talk about MS-DOS proper, I talk about it\u2019s \u201cgrandparents\u201d if you will, Digital Research\u2019s CP/M and Seattle Computer Product\u2019s 86-DOS.\n In addition to writing this article, I also made the following cladogram chart showing the relationships of different DOS \u201cflavors\u201d.I hope to use it in other articles to walk through the history of Digital Research\u2019s DOS, DR DOS and the many transformations it went through.\n The code for the chart can be found in my  Projects repository, under the  Dos Lineage Cladogram folder.\n     CP/M was a operating system designed by Gary Kildall for Digital Research. It was designed for 8-Bit computers, so it ran on Intel 8080/85 and Z80 processors.CP/M originally stood for \u201cControl Program/Monitor\u201d and later \u201cControl Program for Microcomputers\u201d.CP/M 1.4 was the first major version released, later followed by version 2.2.CP/M was even able to run on the Commodore 64, though it required a specialized cartridge that housed a Z80 processor.At the time, IBM was looking for an operating system to use with their IBM PC line of products.IBM discussed licensing CP/M from Digital Research, but they were unable to come to an agreement.IBM looked elsewhere for an operating system and in July of 1980 began talks with Microsoft about their development of MS-DOS, which was based on 86-DOS by Seattle Computer Products.\n While IBM moved on, Digital Research went on to develop their own version of DOS based on CP/M 86 that eventually became DR DOS.As ownership of Digital Research changed, later versions had different names like Novell DOS and Caldera DR-OpenDOS (what a mouthful).This branch of the DOS family is still somewhat alive under the name DR-DOS (with the hyphen) with the last real update being back in 2011.The website for the project is now seemingly dead but it can still be viewed on archive.org.More about this project can be found  here.\n  86-DOS was originally developed by Seattle Computer Products (SCP) beginning in April of 1980.It was originally named QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System), but was changed to 86-DOS once they began shipping in August of 1980.It was first developed to be packaged with CPM\u2019s 8086 computer kit.SCP originally wanted to simply use Digital Research\u2019s 8086 version of CP/M, but with an uncertain release date SCP made the decision to develop an OS themselves.While writing it, the programmer Tim Paterson referenced the manual for CP/M-80 which explains why CP/M and QDOS were so alike.Because of its similarity to CP/M, it was easy to port programs originally designed for CP/M on 8080 and Z80 processors to QDOS, which targeted 8086 processors.Development of the software ended up taking only 6 weeks.\n QDOS 0.11 was released in August of 1980, which is when it was renamed to 86-DOS.Microsoft ended up licensing it from SCP in December of 1980 and in May of the following year hired Tim Patterson to assist in porting it to the IBM PC.A month before Microsoft\u2019s new operating system was release, they purchased all rights to 86-DOS from SCP for only $50,000.After settling a lawsuit over the deal with SCP, Microsoft later ended up paying a total $1 million.Microsoft took it\u2019s adapted 86-DOS 1.14, created MS-DOS 1.10/1.14, and licensed it to IBM who sold by IBM under the name PC DOS 1.0.\n  PC DOS versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 5.0, and 6.0 were developed primarily by Microsoft, though IBM made additions of their own specific to their computers.For some versions, Microsoft didn\u2019t directly contribute to development but IBM based their changes on existing code.[2]This was one of the few instances where Microsoft licensed MS-DOS to another company and had allowed the company to rebrand it.A few other versions that were licensed and rebranded were SB-DOS, COMPAQ-DOS, NCR-DOS AND Z-DOS.Eventually, it started enforcing the MS-DOS name for all OEM\u2019s except IBM.\n While the development of different MS-DOS versions was fairly standard, version 4.0 and 4.1 were interesting.MS-DOS 4.0 was based on MS-DOS 2.0 and was developed in paralell with MS-DOS 3.0.This version was designed as a multitasking version of DOS.It was designed to allow specially written programs to run in the background while the user continued to interact in the foreground, similar to services in Windows.While being developed, IBM and other OEM\u2019s weren\u2019t interested in it so Microsoft instead had a limited release in Europe.Interestingly, the same developers who worked on this multitasking version moved on to work on what became OS/2, an operating system for IBM PC\u2019s.\n Though MS-DOS 4.1 was worked on and developed, it never really saw a wider release.It was interesting as an operating system, but \u201cMicrosoft at the time was a 100% OEM shop \u2013 we didn\u2019t sell operating systems, we sold operating systems to hardware vendors who sold operating systems with their hardware.\u201d[3]Instead, the next \u201creal\u201d version of MS-DOS released was 4.00 which distinguished itself with an extra \u201c0\u201d in the version number.This was the version that was also rebranded as PC DOS 4.0 for IBM.\n  MS-DOS 6.3 was the last version that was released as a stand alone program.The next version, MS-DOS 7.0 was released as part of Windows 95.Both Windows 95 Revision 2 and the first release of Windows 98 were equipped with MS-DOS 7.1 running things behind the scenes.These were the first major versions of MS-DOS that were completely separate from PC DOS, whose version 7.0 was developed by IBM alone.\n The final version of MS-DOS was released as a part of Windows ME in September of 2000.This was the last version of windows that used MS-DOS as a foundation.Windows XP moved to the NT kernel, whose primary difference was moving away from a monolithic kernel to a hybrid kernel.With MS-DOS, the kernel and operating system exists completely within the kernel space.Windows NT uses a safer structure, where the kernel is split between the kernel space and the user space.\n          A history of the personal computer. Chapter 12 (Microsoft in the 1980s) and Appendix B (Versions of DOS) are especially interesting:  http://www.retrocomputing.net/info/allan/\n A collection of old operating systems, including disk

"note_en": "The original 2004  How to Drop Out is easily the most popular thing I&#39;ve written, and thousands of people have found my site by putting &#34;how to drop out of society&#34; into Google, but I wonder if it was worth it. The message I was aiming for was something like &#34;If you have the mental focus and self-discipline to be successful in the dominant society, but you don&#39;t like it, here&#39;s how you can change your value system to reduce your need for money and status, and gain some benefits of industrial civilization without being in a position of forced obedience.&#34; Or: &#34;Society is your enemy, it attacks you by making you need money, and if you are better than the average person at sacrificing comfort for long-term goals, you can work toward a position where you need relatively little money and have more free time.&#34;  Instead, through great carelessness, I allowed people to think my message was something like &#34;If you can&#39;t even get good grades or hold down a job, don&#39;t worry, there is a gateway to a magical wonderland in the nearest dumpster.&#34; Or: &#34;If you have a weak sense of who you are and you need an inspiring story to give your life meaning, how about being a heroic puritan like me, whose goal is to avoid guilt through an impossible lifestyle that has no connection to a society that is viewed as a cartoonish monolithic evil.&#34;  Over the years a lot of readers have been disappointed that I&#39;m not that guy, and at least a few have quit classes and jobs that they should have stayed with. Even I sometimes lost focus on what I really needed. I dabbled in homesteading and discovered that it requires too much work and way too much driving, while the excitement of living in the woods fades quickly. Looking back on the popular myth that first attracted me to primitive living, what I wanted out there was something that is easier to find in the city (but still difficult): close to zero obligations, and giant blocks of time with nothing I&#39;m supposed to be doing. I&#39;m still working on that.   &#34;How To Drop Out&#34; has been my most popular piece of writing for more than four years. In that time I&#39;ve bought some land, which you can read about on my  landblog, and I&#39;ve shifted my main residence to Spokane, where it&#39;s harder to find good food in dumpsters, so my expenses are higher. Also, I&#39;ve decided I need to be even more aggressive in dispelling the very powerful myths that are tied to the idea of dropping out of society. So here&#39;s a new short version of the essay, hitting the main points, adding a few new points, and really hammering the points that people keep missing. The original essay is below it.   1. Do not drop out. Instead, try to stop yourself from committing suicide until you can find a job that is so non-hellish that it does not make you suicidal, and then stay at that job, or an even better one if you can find it, for several decades. Grab what fun you can on the weekends, save up money, enjoy your retirement, and you will have lived a pretty good life.  Seriously, it&#39;s good to live differently, to take uncommon paths, to minimize your dependence on a society gone astray. But if I were to say, &#34;Woo-hoo! Dropping out is so cool! Quit your job now and hop a freight train to Bolivia, and you will be ALIVE while everyone else is DEAD,&#34; then that might be worse than saying nothing. Motivational writing is a drug. If you require a motivational writer or speaker to live differently, then as soon as that external energy shot wears off, you will fizzle and burn out. But if everyone is trying to discourage you from doing something, and you do it anyway,  then you have the internal motivation to persist and succeed. So: dropping out is not fun -- better not do it.   2. &#34;Drop out&#34; is a bad metaphor, because it implies you are either in or out. In reality,  no one has ever been in or out -- everyone is somewhere in between. The most pathetic office drone still has forbidden dreams, and the most extreme mountain man still has commerce with society. Your mission is to find a niche, somewhere in this range, where you&#39;re not held over a barrel by a system that gives you no participation in power.   3. It&#39;s not about being pure. It&#39;s not about keeping your hands clean or avoiding guilt. Imagine birds living in a forest. Humans come and cut the forest down and build barns and plant crops. If some birds are able to live in the barns, or eat the crops, they don&#39;t say, &#34;I&#39;m not going to live in the barn -- that&#39;s cheating,&#34; or &#34;I&#39;m not going to eat the crops, because then I&#39;m just part of the system.&#34; Of all the species on Earth, only humans are that stupid.  Now, that doesn&#39;t mean you should accept all gifts. Sometimes the &#34;crops&#34; are poisoned or the &#34;barns&#34; are traps. By all means, when you are offered benefits, use your full intelligence to see what strings are attached. And if you reject something, reject it because you see that it will do you more harm than good, not because you have some silly obsession with purity. Here&#39;s a test: when Thoreau was living at Walden Pond, he would often go into town for dinners with his family. If you see anything wrong with that, read this section again, or read this piece about the  myth of self-sufficiency.   4. &#34;Out&#34; is relative and not absolute. It is a path and not a destination. And you walk the path not by disconnecting from the rest of the world, but by engaging it in an intelligent and creative way, instead of in one of the disempowering ways that are made to look like the only ways. The myth of the pure and total outsider is one of those disempowering ways. It&#39;s a trick designed to make you set an impossible goal, get discouraged, and give up.   5. Do not try to find a job doing what you love. This is my most radical advice. There are some people in the world who have jobs they love so much that they would do them for free. If you become one of these people, you will probably get there not through planning but through luck, by doing what you love for free until somehow the money starts coming in. But if you make an effort to combine your income and your love, you are likely to end up compromising both, making a poverty income by doing something you don&#39;t quite love, or no longer love. For example, if you decide to become a chef because you love cooking, it will probably make you hate cooking, because cooking will become linked in your mind to all the bullshit around the job.  What I recommend instead is to separate your money from your love. Get the most low-stress source of income that you can find, and then do exactly what you love for free. It might eventually make you money or it might not. &#34;Do what you love and the money will follow&#34; is mostly false. The real rule is: &#34;If you&#39;re doing what you love, you won&#39;t care if you never make any money from it -- but you still need money.&#34;   6. When you begin to get free, you will get depressed. It works like this: When you were three years old, if your parents weren&#39;t too bad, you knew how to play spontaneously. Then you had to go to school, where everything you did was required. The worst thing is that even the fun activities, like singing songs and playing games, were commanded under threat of punishment. So even play got tied up in your mind with a control structure, and severed from the life inside you. If you were &#34;rebellious&#34;, you preserved the life inside you by connecting it to forbidden activities, which are usually forbidden for good reasons, and when your rebellion ended in suffering and failure, you figured the life inside you was not to be trusted. If you were &#34;obedient&#34;, you simply crushed the life inside you almost to death.  Freedom means you&#39;re not punished for saying no. The most fundamental freedom is the freedom to do nothing. But when you get this freedom, after many years of activities that were forced, nothing is all you want to do. You might start projects that seem like the kind of thing you&#39;re supposed to love doing, music or writing or art, and not finish because nobody is forcing you to finish and it&#39;s not really what you want to do. It could take months, if you&#39;re lucky, or more likely years, before you can build up the life inside you to an intensity where it can drive projects that you actually enjoy and finish, and then it will take more time before you build up enough skill that other people recognize your actions as valuable.   7. Hard work is satanic. Primitive humans have moments of extreme exertion, but they don&#39;t go through life in a hurry, they don&#39;t push themselves, and even when they live on the edge of hunger, they don&#39;t stress about it. Even medieval serfs worked fewer hours, and at a slower pace, than modern industrialized workers. Ivan Illich has written that at the dawn of the industrial age, they would put a man in a pit that gradually filled with water, and give him a pump, and he would have to pump constantly all day to not drown. Humans are so naturally resistant to hard work that it took something like that to train people for industrial jobs. Now they do it with the schooling system, and with the religious doctrine that hard work is morally virtuous.  The opposite of hard work is quality work. Quality work may be done quickly, but it is never pushed. It arranges itself around the goal of doing something as well as it can be done, and it finds its own pace.  Another opposite of hard work is playful work. Like quality work it may be done quickly but is never pushed. But playful work is indifferent to quality, or even to success. When you&#39;re doing playful work, you don&#39;t care if it ends in total failure, because you&#39;re having such a good time that you would look forward to doing the whole job again.   8. There are no easy rules. This is a tangential point. If you&#39;re interested in dropping out of society, you are also likely to reject society&#39;s rules, and try to replace them with counterculture rules or rules of your own invention. Humans are map-making animals, and we&#39;re always trying to make a map so good that we no longer have to look at the land. This is a mistake, and if you reject the dominant map, it&#39;s best to learn to not use any map at all. There is one rule that&#39;s very simple, but not easy: observe reality and adjust.   9. Don&#39;t rush it. Getting free is not like walking through a magic doorway -- it&#39;s like growing a fruit tree.        I didn&#39;t even start dropping out until my mid-20&#39;s. Unlike many outsiders and &#34;radicals,&#34; I never had to go through a stage where I realized that our whole society is insane -- I&#39;ve known that as long as I can remember. But even being already mentally outside the system, I found it extremely challenging to get out physically. In fourth grade I wanted to blow up the school, but I didn&#39;t know how, and even if I had done it, it would not have meant an endless summer vacation. In high school, inspired by Bill Kaysing&#39;s  The Robin Hood Handbook, I wanted to go live off the land in the Idaho wilderness, but actually doing it seemed as remote and difficult as going to the moon. (Kaysing later wrote the book  We Never Went to the Moon.) So I continued to bide my time and obey the letter of the law, like the guy in the Kafka parable  (link). In college, when Artis the Spoonman performed on campus and told us all to drop out, I thought that was ridiculous -- how would I survive without a college degree?  A few years later, with my two college degrees, after jobs operating envelope-stuffing machinery and answering phones in a warehouse, I was finally nudged toward dropping out by the Bush I recession and my own nature -- that I&#39;m extremely frugal, love unstructured time, and would sooner eat garbage than feign enthusiasm. More than ten years later I&#39;m a specialist at eating garbage -- as I draft this I&#39;m eating a meal I made with organic eggs from a dumpster, and later I&#39;ll make a pie of dumpstered apples. I live on under $2000 a year, I have no permanent residence, and moving to the Idaho wilderness now seems like a reachable goal -- but no longer the best idea.  Getting free of the system is more complex than we&#39;ve been led to believe. Here as in so many places, our thinking has been warped by all-or-nothingism, by the Hollywood myth of the sudden overwhelming victory: Quit your corporate job this minute, sell all your possessions, and hop a freight train to a straw bale house in the mountains where you&#39;ll grow all your own food and run with the wolves! In reality, between the extremes there&#39;s a whole dropout universe, and no need to hurry.  In my case, as I understood what I had to go through to make money, I stopped spending it. I learned to make my meals from scratch, and then from cheaper scratch, making my own sourdough bread and tortillas. I stopped buying music and books (exceptions in exceptional cases) and got in the habit of using the library. When I crashed my car, I kept the insurance money and walked, and then got an old road bike. I took a road trip by hitchhiking, but it was too physically taxing and I got sick. Like many novice radicals, I got puritanical and pushed myself too hard, and finally eased off. I temporarily owned another car and lived in it for a couple months of a long road trip. In the Clinton economic bubble, I got a job that was much easier and better paying than my previous jobs, and built up savings that I&#39;m still living on.  The main thing I was doing during those years was de-institutionalizing myself, learning to navigate the hours of the day and the thoughts in my head with no teacher or boss telling me what to do. I had to learn to relax without getting lethargic, to never put off washing the dishes, to balance the needs of the present and the future, to have spontaneous fun but avoid addiction, to be intuitive, to notice other people, to make big and small decisions. I went through mild depression and severe fatigue and embarrassing obsessions and strange diets and simplistic new age thinking. It&#39;s a long and ugly road, and most of us have to walk it, or something like it, to begin to be free.  A friend says, &#34;This world makes it easy to toe the line, and easy to totally fuck up, and really hard to not do either one.&#34; But this hard skill, not quitting your job or moving to the woods or reducing consumption or doing art all day, is the essence of dropping out. When people rush it, and try to take shortcuts, they slide into addiction or debt or depression or shattered utopian communities, and then go back to toeing the line.  The path is different for everyone. Maybe you&#39;re already intuitive and decisive and know how to have fun, but you don&#39;t know how to manage money or stay grounded. Maybe you&#39;re using wealth or position or charm to keep from having to relate to people as equals, or you&#39;re keeping constantly busy to avoid facing something lurking in the stillness. Whatever weaknesses keep you dependent on the system, you have to take care of them before you break away from the system, just as you have to learn to swim before you escape a ship. How? By going out and back, a little farther each time, with persistence and patience, until you reach the skill and distance that feels right.  At the moment there&#39;s no reason to drop out &#34;all the way&#34; except puritanism. I hate civilization as much as anyone, but in these last few years before it crashes, we should appreciate and use what it offers. Sylvan Hart (his given name!), the 20th century mountain man who even smelted his own metal, still traded with civilization, and once carried a sheet of glass 50 miles through the woods so he could have a good window. (See Harold Peterson,  The Last of the Mountain Men)  Some of the happiest people I know have dropped out only a short distance. They still live in the city and have jobs and pay rent, but they&#39;ve done something more mentally difficult -- and mentally liberating -- than moving to some isolated farm. They have become permanently content with low-status, modest-paying jobs that they don&#39;t have to think about at home or even half the time when they&#39;re at work. Yes, these jobs are getting scarce, but they&#39;re still a thousand times more plentiful than the kind of job that miserable people cannot give up longing for -- where you make a living doing something so personally meaningful that you would do it for free.  &#34;Do what you love and the money will follow&#34; is an irresponsible lie, a denial of the deep opposition between money and love. The real rule is: &#34;If you&#39;re doing what you love, you won&#39;t care if you never make a cent from it, because that&#39;s what love means -- but you still need money!&#34; So what I recommend, as the second element of dropping out, is coldly severing your love from your income. One part of your life is to make only as much money as you need, at a job that you can come home from feeling energized and not drained. And then the important part of your life is to do just exactly what you love, with zero pressure to make money. And if you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;ll eventually make money anyway.  But how much money do you &#34;need&#34;? And what if the only jobs available are low-paying and so exhausting that you come home and collapse into bed? These questions lead to my own level of dropping out, which is to reduce expenses to the point that you shift your whole identity from the high-budget to the low-budget universe.  In a temperate climate, you have only five physical needs: food, water, clothing, shelter, and fuel. (If you&#39;re a raw-foodist and don&#39;t mind the cold, you don&#39;t even need fuel!) Everything else that costs money is a luxury or a manufactured need. Manufactured needs have fancy names: entertainment, transportation, education, employment, housing, &#34;health care.&#34; In every case these are creations of, and enablers of, an alienating and dominating system, a world of lost wholeness.  If you love your normal activities, you don&#39;t need to tack on &#34;entertainment.&#34; If you aren&#39;t forced to travel many miles a day, you don&#39;t need &#34;transportation.&#34; If you are permitted to learn on your own, you don&#39;t need &#34;education.&#34; If you can meet all your physical needs through the direct action of yourself and your friends, you don&#39;t need to go do someone else&#39;s work all day. If you&#39;re permitted to merely occupy physical space and build something to keep the wind and rain out, you don&#39;t need to pay someone to &#34;provide&#34; it. Expensive health care is especially insidious: not only is our toxic and stressful society the primary cause of sickness, but the enormous expenses that have been added in the last hundred years are mostly profit-making scams that cause and prolong sickness far more than they heal it.  This is the low-budget universe: I ride around the city on an old cheap road bike, in street clothes, often hauling food I&#39;ve just pulled out of a dumpster. Sometimes I&#39;ll be on a trail where I&#39;ll invariably be passed by people on thousand dollar bikes in racing outfits. Why are they riding around if they&#39;re not carrying anything? And why are they in such a hurry?  I used to be envious of those suckers: I  haveto ride my bike to survive and they&#39;re so rich they do it for fun. But what is this &#34;fun&#34;? I get everything -- exercise, getting from place to place, meaningfulness, the feeling of autonomy, and doing what&#39;s necessary to survive -- all with the same activity: riding my bike. They should be envious of me: my life is elegant and theirs is disjointed and self-defeating, \n......", "posttime": "2022-02-15 02:45:43", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u9000\u5b66,drop", "title": "\u5982\u4f55\u9000\u5b66\uff082004\uff09", "title_en": "How to Drop Out (2004)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://ranprieur.com/essays/dropout.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9000\u5b66", "drop"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1073226, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "2\u670810\u65e5\uff08\u8def\u900f\u793e\uff09-\u7f8e\u56fd\u8d22\u653f\u90e8\u5468\u56db\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c1\u6708\u4efd\u516c\u5e03\u4e861190\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u9884\u7b97\u76c8\u4f59\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e24\u5e74\u591a\u6765\u7684\u9996\u6b21\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u7a0e\u6536\u6536\u5165\u5f3a\u52b2\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4e0e\u75ab\u60c5\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u652f\u51fa\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\n\u4e00\u6708\u76c8\u4f59\u4e0e2019\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u75be\u75c5\u76841630\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c2021\u5e741\u6708\u7684\u8d22\u653f\u8d64\u5b57\u662f\u76f4\u63a5\u53d1\u653e\u7ed9\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u57282020\u5e7412\u6708\u53d1\u5e03\u3002\n\u4e0a\u6708\u7684\u76c8\u4f59\u662f2019\u5e749\u6708\u62a5\u544a\u7684830\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u4ee5\u6765\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u76c8\u4f59\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f2019\u5e744\u6708\u62a5\u544a\u76841600\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u4ee5\u6765\u7684\u6700\u5927\u76c8\u4f59\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\uff0c4\u6708\u548c9\u6708\u662f\u7a0e\u6536\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u6708\u4efd\u3002\n1\u6708\u4efd\u7684\u6536\u5165\u589e\u957f\u4e8621%\uff0c\u8fbe\u52304650\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f97\u76ca\u4e8e\u4e2a\u4eba\u9884\u6263\u6240\u5f97\u7a0e\u548c\u5de5\u8d44\u7a0e\u589e\u957f\u4e8621%\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u590d\u82cf\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5c31\u4e1a\u548c\u6536\u5165\u589e\u52a0\u3002\n\u4e00\u6708\u7684\u652f\u51fa\u4e0b\u964d\u4e8637%\uff0c\u8fbe\u52303460\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u4ed6\u4eec\u57282021\u5e741\u6708\u6ca1\u6709\u5305\u62ec1420\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u523a\u6fc0\u652f\u51fa\u3002\n\u4e00\u4f4d\u7f8e\u56fd\u8d22\u653f\u90e8\u5b98\u5458\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u672c\u6708\u7684\u76c8\u4f59\u8fd8\u5f97\u76ca\u4e8e\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u65e0\u7ebf\u9891\u8c31\u62cd\u5356\u7684700\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u6536\u76ca\u3002\n\u4ece10\u67081\u65e5\u5f00\u59cb\u76842022\u8d22\u5e74\u7684\u524d\u56db\u4e2a\u6708\uff0c\u8d22\u653f\u90e8\u62a5\u544a\u4e862590\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u8d64\u5b57\uff0c\u6bd4\u4e0a\u5e747360\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u8d64\u5b57\u4e0b\u964d\u4e8665%\u3002\u4eca\u5e74\u8fc4\u4eca\u7684\u6536\u5165\u589e\u957f\u4e8628%\uff0c\u8fbe\u52301.52\u4e07\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u800c\u540c\u671f\u7684\u652f\u51fa\u4e0b\u964d\u4e868%\uff0c\u8fbe\u52301.78\u4e07\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002", "note_en": "Feb 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. government posted a $119 billion budget surplus in January, the first in more than two years, amid strong growth in tax receipts and a sharp drop in pandemic-related outlays, the Treasury Department said on Thursday.\n The January surplus compared to a January 2021 deficit of $163 billion, a record for the month as direct payments to individuals from COVID-19 aid legislation enacted in December 2020 were distributed.\n The surplus last month was the first since the $83 billion reported in September 2019 and the largest since the $160 billion in April 2019. April and September are traditionally months with high tax collections.\n  The January receipts grew by 21% to $465 billion, boosted by a 21% jump in individual withheld income and payroll taxes that reflected higher employment and earnings due to the economic recovery.\n January outlays fell 37% to $346 billion, partly as they did not include $142 billion in individual stimulus payments sent in January 2021.\n The surplus for the month also was helped by the recognition of $70 billion in proceeds from a wireless spectrum auction, a U.S. Treasury official said.\n For the first four months of the 2022 fiscal year that started Oct. 1, the Treasury reported a deficit of $259 billion, a 65% decline from the year-earlier deficit of $736 billion. Year-to-date receipts grew 28% to $1.52 trillion, while outlays for the period fell 8% to $1.78 trillion.", "posttime": "2022-02-15 02:44:04", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name":

"note_en": "A few days ago I came across this  article.\u00a0The author shows how to access a  Drupal system in the backend with a Vue.js app. For authentication he uses an API key - and I find that dangerous. Here&#39;s why.\n First, let me briefly explain the setup presented in the article: The backend is provided by Drupal. Drupal has integrated a JSON API in core since version 8, which can be easily activated via module management. With this it is now possible to access all entities (e.g. users, nodes, etc.) and read them via GET request.\n  The JSON API is based on the defined permissions in the Drupal system. So if a user has no read access to a content, then this content can also not be loaded via the JSON API. The same is true here for write access: an entity can only be created, modified or deleted if the accessing user has the appropriate permission.\n  But back to the article: Here, the author describes how he accesses the Drupal backend in a client-side Vue app to create content. In the example shown, he creates a content (also called a node in Drupal) of type &#34;article&#34;.\n Now it gets interesting: he has configured his Drupal system so that only logged-in users can create articles. So, in order to create an article via the JSON API, he must first authenticate himself.\n There are several ways to authenticate to\u00a0Drupal. The usual way is via a username and password. This is not only possible directly via the frontend, but also via the API. Here Drupal returns a session ID after successful authentication, which you can cache and use for all further requests.\n  The author now uses another way: he installs the  Key auth module. This creates an API key for each user in the backend, which can be used for the authentication to\u00a0the API. For this purpose, the parameter &#34;api-key&#34; must be passed with the key as value for each call. With this the user is automatically authenticated in Drupal and has all assigned rights.\n  And here he makes a dangerous mistake: he integrates the API key from the Drupal backend into his Vue.js app to be able to authenticate to the API and create content.\n  A Vue.js app is executed client-side nin the user&#39;s browser. This means that the source code is sent from the server directly to the browser. Now here the user has full access to the source code and can also read the auth key it contains.\n  An environment variable is written to the source code during the build process of the web app. Environment variables are meant (as the name suggests) to provide different variables for different environments. For example, you can use different variables in a development environment than in a staging environment or a production environment. For example, if you want to integrate the payment provider  Stripe, you can use Stripe&#39;s test mode in the development and staging environment, while you use Stripe&#39;s live mode in the production environment.\n But the CORS setting makes sure that I can only access the backend from a certain domain\n No! CORS is an implementation in the browser and is designed to protect the user from malicious applications by ensuring that the resource in the browser is only allowed to access specific endpoints.\n This browser implementation can be bypassed at any time. First, it is up to the browser itself: if CORS is not integrated, or not integrated cleanly, then it will not work. The server sends a CORS header and it is up to the browser to decide how to handle it. This is not a security element, because it is not in the hands of the server to deny access here, but solely in the hands of the browser.\n  An attacker can access the API key via the source code of the web app and use it, for example, via a cURL request to directly access the API resources of the backend. With cURL, no CORS takes effect, so the attacker has direct access with the full rights of the user.\n  An API key is an alternative to a username and password. Nobody would think of storing a username and password in the source code of a web app.\n However, there are scenarios where this would still be possible. For example, if the API key had restricted rights. This is certainly the case for some services (e.g. some Google services, like Google Maps).\n However, the &#34;Key auth&#34; module described in the article does not restrict the rights of the key. It is just an alternative to the username &amp; password.\n  I came across the article because I was looking for ways to authenticate a Vue APP to a Drupal backend. Designkojo&#39;s article was one of the first to show up at the top of the search engine. In addition, the article has charm: it is well and compactly described. Especially for beginners the described way is easy and fast to implement. And it suggests: authentication via API key is a common way for a Web-App. And this is where it gets dangerous: especially inexperienced developers can fall for it and think that this is a common way to authenticate with a web app to a backend.\n I contacted the author of the article via Twitter and explained my point of view. We had a discussion about it and he got my point. He added a warning to his article.", "posttime": "2022-02-15 02:40:18", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "api,meant", "title":

still get them from the  Internet Archive. But there are a couple of tricks you\u2019ll need to know if you want to get things running and preserve your playing history.\n February 10 was the last day Wordle was still available at its old site. A URL to one of the Wayback Machine snapshots on that day is\n  But you don\u2019t want to download the HTML and JavaScript you get from this link, because they will include additional code that the Internet Archive adds to make it work on their site. Modify the URL slightly by adding \u201cid_\u201d after the timestamp string,\n  and you\u2019ll get the both the original HTML and JavaScript. This is a trick that works for  every Wayback Machine page.\n  The easiest way to get the HTML is choose  Show Page Source in the  Develop menu (you  do have the  Develop menu activated, don\u2019t you?) and copy the code that appears in the lower center portion of the window.  1 To get the JavaScript, copy the code from the  main.e65ce0a5.js file in the Extra Scripts folder in the lower left part of the window.\n Now you have the two files needed to run Wordle either locally or on a server you control. What about your history? Unfortunately, that will be reset if you start playing from a new location. But if you take screenshots of your history and your last game, you can get the information needed to restore your history.\n Wordle uses what\u2019s called  local storage to save your most recent game and your history. The most recent game information is stored in  gameState and the history in  statistics. You can set these by making a simple web page that runs some JavaScript. Here\u2019s an example:\n xml: 1: &lt;html&gt; 2: &lt;head&gt; 3: &lt;title&gt;Setting history?&lt;/title&gt; 4: &lt;script type=&#34;text/javascript&#34;&gt; 5: function n(e, a, s) { 6: return a in e ?

Lines 43\u201344 are a time stamp (in microseconds) for your most recent game. If it happens to be today, you can get that (more or less) from the  date command:\n  Because  date returns seconds, and we need microseconds, just add three zeros to the end of the return value.\n After you\u2019ve made these changes, save the file as  sethistory.html in the same directory as the Wordle HTML file. Then navigate to that page using the browser and device you like to play Wordle on, click the  Set History button (which may be a tiny button in the upper left corner if you\u2019re doing this on an iPhone), and your new Wordle should be set to carry on from your old one.\n I\u2019m using the terminology from Safari. There are similar commands in other browsers.\u00a0 \u21a9", "posttime": "2022-02-15 02:37:45", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u62d6\u62c9,wordle", "title": "\u4e3a\u62d6\u62c9\u8005\u91cd\u63d0\u65e7\u8bcd", "title_en": "Resurrecting the old Wordle for procrastinators", "transed": 1, "url": "https://leancrew.com/all-this/2022/02/resurrecting-the-old-wordle-for-procrastinators/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u62d6\u62c9", "wordle"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1073223, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Y\u548c#39\uff1b\u4e00\u5207\u90fd\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u6602\u8d35\u3002\u5e26\u5bbd\u6210\u672c\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u9ad8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba2\u960512ft Pro\u5e2e\u52a9\u4fdd\u6301\u7f51\u7ad9\u5728\u7ebf\u3002\n\u5b83\u7ed9\u4f60\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u8001\u5b9e\u8bf4\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u4e0d\u591a\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u7684chrome\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5728\u4f7f\u752812\u82f1\u5c3a\u65f6\u4e3a\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u4fbf\u5229\u3002\n\u6211&#39\uff1b\u6211\u6b63\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u3002\u5b83&#39\uff1b\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u6e05\u7406\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4f7f\u547d\uff0c\u6211\u6709\u5b8f\u4f1f\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u3002\n\u4f60\u768412\u7f8e\u5143/\u5e74\u5c06\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u52a9\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u597d\u7248\u672c\u768412ft\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5f53\u524d\u670d\u52a1\u5728\u7ebf\u3002", "note_en": "Y&#39;all are getting expensive.
