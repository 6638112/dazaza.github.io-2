", "note_en": "Social-media users are sharing Google Street View images featuring friends and relatives who have since died.\n It was sparked by a post on the Twitter account Fesshole, which asks followers to submit anonymous confessions - many of which are explicit.\n The original poster said they had searched the map platform for images taken before their father had died.\n  The BBC&#39;s Neil Henderson shared an image of his late father at his front door.\n &#34;I have literally hundreds of pics of my dad but the Google Street View is quite affecting, like he&#39;s still around,&#34; he wrote.\n  Another tweeter showed an image of a couple holding hands in the street - his parents, he said, who had died several years ago.\n  One captured a lady just outside her doorway. &#34;My mum creeping outside for a cigarette,&#34; wrote Bernard Baker.\n   Others said just seeing local images taken when their loved ones were still alive made them feel a connection.\n And some expressed regret images poignant to them had been replaced with more recent photos.\n There is, however, a way to look back at previous incarnations - by  tapping the clock icon on the top left-hand side of Google Maps (the feature does not appear on Google Earth), if it is there.\n Karim Palant used this tool to find a former image of his late grandfather Charles Palant, taken from the street in 2015 and showing him leaning out of his window from his apartment in Paris to talk to his carer below.\n    &#34;He was in that flat for maybe 70 years, and I spent loads of happy times there,&#34; Karim said.\n Karim added that his grandfather was having computer lessons while aged in his 90s, but he doesn&#39;t believe he had seen Google Street View, and the family only became aware of the photograph after his death.\n &#34;It&#39;s such a sunny day in the photo and he looks so relaxed, it just reminds me of a happy time and place,&#34; he said.\n  Searching through Google Street View for strange objects or bizarre moments captured in freezeframe has become something of a niche internet pastime.\n On TikTok alone, there are more than 660 million videos tagged with the website and many popular accounts showing videos of weird things found on the site.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 07:30:52", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

for building machine learning models. The two companies say the deal will combine Determined AI\u2019s software with HPE\u2019s high-performance computing (HPC) offerings. Terms of the deal weren\u2019t publicly disclosed.\n Building and training machine learning models are among the most demanding stages in AI development because researchers must face challenges in HPC. These include setting up and managing parallel workloads and configuring infrastructure that spans compute, storage, fabric, and accelerators. Researchers also need to know how to program, schedule, and train their models to maximize utilization of the infrastructure they\u2019ve set up.\n  Determined AI, which was cofounded in 2017 by Ameet Talwalkar, Evan Sparks, and Neil Conway, counts among its key contributors Ph.D. students and faculty from the University of California, Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon. The company\u2019s platform helps set up, fine-tune, manage, and share workstations and clusters that run on-premises or in the cloud, as well as speeding up model training via capabilities like accelerator scheduling, advanced hyperparameter optimization, and neural architecture search. (Hyperparameters are variables whose values are used to control the learning process, while neural architecture search is a technique for automating the design of particular AI models.)\n Determined AI claims it accelerated AI-guided drug discovery for one customer from three days to three hours. \u201cThe Determined AI team is excited to join HPE, who shares our vision to realize the potential of AI,\u201d Sparks said. \u201cOver the last several years, building AI applications has become extremely compute-, data-, and communication-intensive. By combining with HPE\u2019s industry-leading HPC and AI solutions, we can accelerate our mission to build cutting-edge AI applications and significantly expand our customer reach.\u201d\n  With the Determined AI purchase, HPE is chasing after an HPC market that\u2019s becoming red hot.  According to IDC, the accelerated AI server segment is expected to grow by 38% each year to reach $18 billion by 2024. And Intersect360 Research  notes that the demand for HPC will increase by more than 40% to reach almost $55 billion in revenue by 2024.\n In May, HPE  expanded its GreenLake hybrid cloud services platform with a new data services cloud console, a suite of infrastructure management services, and HPE Alletra, cloud-native infrastructure for edge-to-cloud data workflows. In December 2020, HPE took the wraps off HPE GreenLake cloud services, a pay-per-use service providing access to fully managed, prebundled services based on HPC systems.\n \u201cAs we enter the Age of Insight, our customers recognize the need to add machine learning to deliver better and faster answers from their data,\u201d HPE SVP Justin Hotard said in a press release. \u201cAI-powered technologies will play an increasingly critical role in turning data into readily available, actionable information to fuel this new era. Determined AI\u2019s unique open source platform allows machine learning engineers to build models faster and deliver business value sooner without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. I am pleased to welcome the world-class Determined AI team, who share our vision to make AI more accessible for our customers and users, into the HPE family.\u201d\n VentureBeat&#39;s mission is to be a digital town square for technical decision-makers to gain knowledge about transformative technology and transact.Our site delivers essential information on data technologies and strategies to guide you as you lead your organizations.

more of an \u2018oh, it can work\u2019 experiment. So it\u2019s only partly serious and mostly fun. So buckle up!\n I apologise in advance for the camera work - CRTs displaying interlaced content are  hard work!\n My original idea was to set up a connection from my PC to the TV to play old games and I did investigate going down the  SDI route, however strangely my Sony PVM doesn\u2019t play nicely with the SDI module in place. For a long time, changing to an input without external sync but with external sync enabled would send the poor TV into a \u2018panic\u2019 mode (which would display a sad orange coloured light on the tally light). This wouldn\u2019t be so bad except it would happen every time you turned off a console without either first disabling the external sync OR changing to another input&amp;mldr Anyways. All \u201cfixed\u201d now with the SDI module removed from the Sony PVM-14M4A.\n Back to reality, I feel like the longevity of a DVB tuner \u201cset top box\u201d is really getting towards the bitter end, with most services pumping their best content on \u2018digital\u2019 (aka streaming) platforms and broadcast is slowly taking a trip to the big TV in the sky. It\u2019s a slow decline, but it\u2019s there nonetheless. So here\u2019s an option to migrate with the times - to a degree.\n   You\u2019ll need a few things to get this to work. Here\u2019s my shopping list:\n 1 x HDMI to S-video/Composite downscaler (because  upscaling is way too on trend right now)\n 1 x CRT TV (if you can price-match the retro video game crowd or find out abandoned on the street)\n     The particular downscaler I chose was both cheap and included all required cables. The S-video cable was of particularly higher quality than expected, so that\u2019s a bonus. The case of the unit is metal and overall the quality is decent, even if it\u2019s a mass-produced converter with practically no options or controls.\n      There are a few options here. Either your TV has this function (in which case, use it!) otherwise you\u2019ll be fiddling with the Vertical Height control, which is hopefully in some sort of menu, if not, in a hidden service menu and if not, possibly requires opening the case and fiddling with a potentiometer. Warning, big scary deadly voltages inside. I didn\u2019t bother as the Sony PVM has a simple 16:9 mode button on the front.\n In some ways I prefer to fill the whole screen, for that completeness of view perspective, but I also don\u2019t like running things in the wrong ratio.\n I really wished the cheap downscaler had an option around this for maximum flexibility. No doubt more expensive ones do, but I was interested in keeping this project to a budget. If you start spending crazy money, you might as well buy a new TV!\n  Apart from waiting for some of the parts to arrive, this was probably the longest part of the process. Seriously! Way too many firmware and software updates on a device which was manufactured literally last month (dated May 2021 on the box!).\n I noticed that the number of resolution options in Google TV does differ depending on which device you have plugged in. For example, I get a lot more options when plugged into my far-more-modern LCD TV than what the downscaler box seems to offer. No matter here though, because they\u2019re  all equal-or-higher res than what s-video affords anyway. The quality doesn\u2019t seem to matter all that much, but I settled on a 50hz mode which matches with the PAL mode on the downscaler.\n  It actually works well, better than I had expected. I guess when you downscale a 1080p source to 576i (PAL) or 480i (NTSC) and use a decent TV, it\u2019s going to give you a pretty crisp image. Especially since the content is video and not trying to read a website (although I\u2019ve tried that too and I don\u2019t recommend it).\n As with most CRTs, it\u2019s really difficult to capture the clarity on a camera (also interlacing  really doesn\u2019t help here, I\u2019ve had much more success with 240p).\n Is the Google TV text size too small? No, it\u2019s actually OK enough to use\n Now I can kick back and watch a solid back catalogue of CRT-era content on a CRT. Surely that\u2019s how it was intended to be watched, right?\n Here\u2019s a small sample from one of the best car chase scenes in a movie ever, from the Castle of Cagliostro:\n    The downscaler has a switch for CVBS or S-video but this doesn\u2019t seem to make any difference. I mean, using S-video over Composite is totally going to rock your world, but the physical switch doesn\u2019t seem to actually make  any difference: you can get an S-video signal when the switch is on the CVBS mode. So what\u2019s that all about?\n There is also a switch on the downscaler for NTSC or PAL, which both work just fine. I guess that\u2019s a bit of a philosophical debate over whether 20% higher resolution (480i vs 576i) or 20% higher frame rate (29.97 fps vs 25 fps) is the better option. But maybe try both?

Image Credit: Dog Company CC BY-NC-ND 2.0\n      On June 13, the Hubble Space Telescope&#39;s payload computer stopped working, bringing the great instrument&#39;s operations to a halt. Several attempts have been made to restart \u2013 so far without success \u2013 and astronomers are bracing themselves for the possibility this is the end for the telescope that changed our view of the universe.\n NASA has revealed only limited information about the Hubble trouble and is close-lipped about the chances of getting it up and operating again. On June 16, the NASA website  announced; \u201cAfter analyzing the data, the Hubble operations team is investigating whether a degrading memory module led to the computer halt. The team is preparing to switch to one of several backup modules.\u201d\n Two days later, on June 18, an update  reported; \u201cWhen the operations team attempted to switch to a back-up memory module, however, the command to initiate the backup module failed to complete. Another attempt was conducted on both modules Thursday evening to obtain more diagnostic information while again trying to bring those memory modules online. However, those attempts were not successful.\u201d\n The Hubble Twitter account is no more enlightening. Besides tweeting a link to the media release, its most recent update was a  Father&#39;s day message about Lyman Spitzer, considered the telescope&#39;s parent.\n  Four missions to Hubble fixed problems and upgraded parts of the instruments. However, the last servicing mission took place  in 2009\u00a0\u2013 even that only occurred after a  widespread public campaign. At the time the  JWST, seen as a replacement for Hubble despite operating largely at longer wavelengths, was expected to come into operation soon, reducing Hubble&#39;s importance.\n Twelve years later, with the JWST  still not launched, optimism about its capacity to fill the void Hubble will leave is much more muted, but there are no plans to extend Hubble&#39;s life. Although some hope Hubble could have another ten or even twenty years in it, if a major failure occurs it&#39;s unlikely to be revived.\n Hubble has survived some scares before, most recently a  gyroscope failure before  returning to full capacity.\n It&#39;s hard to believe after 30 years of photographs of  mesmerizing beauty and data that has  transformed our knowledge of almost every field of astronomy, Hubble was once a by-word for failure and government waste. Delays caused by the Challenger disaster and numerous equipment replacements caused the mission&#39;s costs to blow out before Hubble left the ground. Once in space, the primary mirror was revealed to have been polished to the wrong shape. Astonishingly, evidence of the problem had been dismissed, rather than inspiring further checks.\n Although some important work could still be conducted, the telescope remained the butt of widespread  jokes and derision until corrective mirrors  resolved the problem. Since then, however, Hubble has become perhaps the most important single scientific instrument since Galileo\u2019s first telescope.

That hasn\u2019t stopped hordes from stampeding to the local doc-in-a-box for antibody testing. But to get a reliable answer from testing, vaccinated people have to get a specific kind of test, and at the right time.\n Take the test too soon, or rely on one that looks for the wrong antibodies \u2014 all too easy to do, given the  befuddling array of tests now available \u2014 and you may believe yourself to still be vulnerable when you are not.\n Actually, scientists would prefer that the average vaccinated person not get antibody testing at all, on the grounds that it\u2019s unnecessary. In clinical trials, the vaccines authorized in the United States provoked a strong antibody response in virtually all of the participants.\n \u201cMost people shouldn\u2019t even be worrying about this,\u201d said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University.\n But antibody tests can be crucial for people with  weak immune systems or those who take certain medications \u2014 a broad category encompassing millions of people who are recipients of organ donations, have certain blood cancers, or who take steroids or other drugs that suppress the immune system. Mounting evidence suggests that a significant proportion of these people do not produce a sufficient antibody response after vaccination.\n If you must get tested, or just want to, it\u2019s essential to get the right kind of test, Dr. Iwasaki said: \u201cI feel a little bit hesitant to recommend everybody getting tested, because unless they really understood what the test is doing, people might get this wrong sense of not having developed any antibodies.\u201d\n  Early in the pandemic, many commercial tests were designed to look for antibodies to a coronavirus protein called the nucleocapsid, or just N, because after infection, those antibodies  were plentiful in the blood.\n But these antibodies are not as powerful as those required to prevent virus infection, nor do they last as long. More important, antibodies to the N protein are not produced by the vaccines authorized in the United States; instead, those vaccines provoke antibodies to another protein sitting on the surface of the virus, called the spike.\n If people who were never infected are vaccinated and then are tested for antibodies to the N protein instead of to the spike, they may be in for a rude shock.\n  David Lat, a 46-year-old legal writer in Manhattan, was hospitalized for Covid-19 for three weeks in March 2020, and he chronicled most of his illness and recovery on Twitter.\n Over the following year, Mr. Lat was tested for antibodies numerous times \u2014 when he went to his pulmonologist or cardiologist for follow-ups, for example, or to donate plasma. His antibody levels were high in June 2020 but steadily fell over the following months.\n  The decline \u201cdidn\u2019t worry me,\u201d Mr. Lat recalled recently. \u201cI had been told to expect that they would naturally wane, but I was just happy that I was still positive.\u201d\n Mr. Lat was fully vaccinated by March 22 of this year. But an antibody test on April 21, ordered by his cardiologist, was barely positive. Mr. Lat was stunned: \u201cI would have thought a month after being immunized, I would have antibodies through the roof.\u201d\n Mr. Lat  turned to Twitter for an explanation. Florian Krammer, an immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, responded, asking Mr. Lat which test had been used. \u201cThat\u2019s when I looked at the fine print on the test,\u201d Mr. Lat said. He realized it was a test for antibodies to the N protein, not to the spike.\n \u201cIt seems that by default, they just give you the nucleocapsid one,\u201d Mr. Lat said. \u201cI never thought to ask for a different one.\u201d\n In May, the Food and Drug Administration recommended against the use of antibody tests for assessing immunity \u2014 a decision that has  drawn criticism from some scientists \u2014 and provided only bare-bones information about testing to health care providers. Many doctors are still unaware of the differences between antibody tests, or the fact that the tests measure just one form of immunity to the virus.\n Rapid tests that are commonly available deliver a yes-no result and may miss low levels of antibodies. A certain type of lab test, called an Elisa test, may offer a semi-quantitative estimate of antibodies to the spike protein.\n It\u2019s also important to wait to be tested at least two weeks after the second shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, when antibody levels will have risen enough to be detectable. For some people receiving the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, that period may be as long as four weeks.\n \u201cIt\u2019s the timing and the antigen and the sensitivity of the assay \u2014 these are going to be very important,\u201d Dr. Iwasaki said.\n In November, the World Health Organization  set standards for antibody testing, allowing for comparison of different tests. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good tests out there now,\u201d Dr. Krammer said. \u201cLittle by little, all these manufacturers, all these places that run them are adapting to international units.\u201d\n Antibodies are just one aspect of immunity, noted Dr. Dorry Segev, a transplant surgeon and researcher at Johns Hopkins University: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot happening under the surface that antibody tests are not directly measuring.\u201d The body also maintains so-called cellular immunity, a complex network of defenders that also responds to invaders.\n Still, for someone who is vaccinated but immunocompromised, it may be very helpful to know that protection against the virus isn\u2019t what it should be, he said. For example, a transplant patient with poor antibody levels might be able to use test results to convince an employer that he or she should continue to work remotely.\n Mr. Lat has not sought another test. Just learning that the vaccine most likely has given him a fresh increase of antibodies, despite his test results, was reassurance enough: \u201cI trust that the vaccines work.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-22 07:28:59", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u77e5\u9053,vaccine,\u6297\u4f53", "title": "\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\u75ab\u82d7\u662f\u5426\u6709\u6548\uff1f \u5728\u5408\u9002\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5f97\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5 ", "title_en": "Wondering If the Vaccine Worked?
