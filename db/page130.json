Here\u2019s what I found.\n  This question appeared to me a while ago when leafing through an old telephone directory from the early 2000s.\n There are at least ordinary subscribers, business customer support lines, voice mails, and fax machines.Subscribers and customer support lines are not of special interest to me.I am more interested in automated systems that let the caller interact with them somehow.Voice mails and fax machines fit this definition.But is there something else as well?\n As the telephone network predates the Internet in Finland by over 100 years, the systems in it can be very old and obscure.Before the Internet gained popularity, these systems were used to provide similar services we use on the internet today.Would it not be interesting to explore a bit and see what has survived to this day?As there are no Shodan-like search engines for the telephone network, I needed to do the exploration myself.This post describes my exploration efforts.\n To explore, I used wardialing.Wardialing is a technique to call a list of telephone numbers automatically using a computer.Hackers of old used wardialing to explore the telephone network much like port-scanning is used today to explore the Internet.\n I used wardialing to call a bunch of numbers and recorded the first 60 seconds of audio received while staying quiet myself.This produced call recordings I could analyze to learn more about systems in the telephone network.To my knowledge, nobody has published the results of their wardialing efforts before.Especially about wardialing Finnish number-spaces or as recent as 2021.\n How I tried to avoid scaring people with ghost calls in the middle of the night\n On the receiving end, wardialing causes a ghost call.You get a call, which you pick up, but the caller remains silent.After a while, the caller hangs up.This alone can feel threatening to some people.What if additionally you were woken up by the call in the middle of the night and later you learned that everything you said on phone was recorded, shared with third parties, and published?I would be angry.Therefore, I took action to minimize any harm caused to the owners of phone numbers called.\n Voice is personal information in itself.People may also disclose information on the phone they do not want to be shared or published.To avoid violating people\u2019s privacy, I did the following:\n Ensured that any recording of private individuals did not end up outside the EU, being saved by third parties, or used to train machine learning models\n To avoid calling people altogether or flooding emergency services, I chose to call a number space that is typically not used by ordinary subscribers or emergency lines.I also chose to hide the number I was calling from (displays unknown number at the receiver\u2019s end) in hopes that people would not pick up my calls.\n I could have further minimized the personal information collection by recording each call for a shorter amount of time.This however would have made it harder to classify the recordings and recognize the service at the other end.The 60-second recording was considered optimal as it is enough for the call to be connected and for any recordings to play long enough to make sense of them.\n Despite my efforts to not harass private individuals, I woke at least 3 persons in the middle of the night.This was judged by their announcement of the time when answering or apparent sleepiness.My apologies to them!\n As wardialing was done at a very modest speed, I considered it to not be harmful to the bandwidth of the service providers.\n  Since I have no copper Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) line in my house, I had to look for other ways to wardial.I discovered a modern wardialer,  WarVOX, that uses VoIP for calling.I decided to use it.\n To work, WarVOX requires a VoIP trunk.VoIP trunk is a service that acts as a gateway between IP network and the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).There are a few VoIP trunking services in Finland, but they are either for business customers only, or expensive for only occasional wardialing.I also assume they would not be happy with wardialing.Foreign VoIP trunking services are expensive for wardialing Finnish phone numbers.\n After learning about illegal termination in the VoIP business, I learned that there is equipment, such as VoIP GSM gateways, that can be used to set up your own VoIP trunk.Curiously, this equipment comes with the possibility to change the IMSI number.VoIP GSM gateways act as bridges between IP network and the PSTN network through the GSM network.\n With SIM card(s) inside, they connect to the PSTN network like your mobile phone does, allowing you to make and receive calls.On the IP network, they provide an interface, such as SIP, which can be used to programmatically make and receive calls.\n I bought the cheapest VoIP GSM gateway, which provides a SIP interface on the IP network.WarVOX speaks IAX2, not SIP, so I had to configure Asterisk as a proxy between the two protocols.\n To connect to the PSTN network, I bought the cheapest prepaid SIM with a 5 EUR credit.If the service provider does not like my actions, they can simply block this SIM card.\n   Finnish Transport and Communications Agency (Traficom) publishes  decisions regarding telephone network numberings on their website.I used the  Finland\u2019s E164 numbering plan as a starting point for choosing target phone numbers to call.This document from early 2019 specifies the different number spaces and describes their purpose on a high level.\n  No private individuals (I did not want to annoy and scare people with ghost calls in the middle of the night)\n In the end, the freephone space (usage \u201cNon-geographic number - Nationwide service numbers (freephone)\u201d on Finland\u2019s R164 numbering plan) was determined to be the best candidate.The subscriber pays a higher fee for the numbers in this space to cover the costs of the callers.Thus the numbers in this space cost nothing to call so it fits the first requirement.\n I imagine the higher fee would keep the number of private individuals at a minimum, as you would not expect private individuals to pay higher fees so that they can be called for free.Therefore it hypothetically fits the second requirement.\n The number of systems in the freephone space is hard to predict.Having systems in this space would make sense to centralize the costs of using them.\n In the numbering plan, there is also a space for Machine-to-Machine communication that sounds like it contains only machines.Unfortunately, the space is so huge (11 digits) that it is very hard to find numbers that are in use in it.I initially chose this space but gave up after calling over 10 000 numbers without a single answer.\n  The bought VoIP GSM Gateway fits only a single SIM card, and it only supports a single line.Therefore I could only make a single call at a time.The calls were made randomly to numbers belonging to the freephone space.\n WarVOX spent 60 seconds on every call, whether it was answered or not.This resulted in a wardialing speed of 1 call/minute.For 56874 calls, this means roughly 40 days calling day and night.\n The time required to connect the call and the time it takes for someone to pick up is deducted from the 60 seconds.This means that the recordings are all shorter than 60 seconds.\n I configured the VoIP GSM Gateway to not send Caller ID, so fewer people would pick up and nobody would call me back.\n   After running WarVOX, I was left with audio files containing recordings of 1724 answered calls.WarVOX identifies Modems and Fax machines automatically and provides signal graphs for all recordings.The signal graphs can be used to sort the recordings by similarity, but I found this to be poor for classifying and identifying the recordings.\n To avoid listening to all recordings myself, used Google Cloud Speech-to-Text to transcribe the recordings, and then used the transcriptions to aside the call recordings that have the same message.This reduced the number of calls to listen manually to around 300, a bearable number.\n I then manually listened to the different recordings and classified them according to the following diagram:\n  In the diagram, prospect calls are classified and each classification is marked either not interesting or interesting.The interesting ones are the answers that let the caller interact with the service somehow, or may let, as in the case of music and unknown systems.How many recordings each classification contains is visible in the diagram.\n All calls answered by a human were either  businesses or  private individuals.I recognized private individuals from businesses by the informal style of answering the phone.\n It is not possible to determine what exactly there are at the other end when there is only  silence or  ringback on the wire.The fact that the recordings contain ringback indicates though that there is a PBX on the receiving end, which picks up and then tries calling an extension.\n All recordings that were answered by a machine were recordings of human voice,  fax machines, music, or unknown (machine). Music contains recordings that contain music for the whole recording. Unknown (machine) contains recordings of calls that contain electromechanical sound.\n Recordings of human voice were either  announcements that announced something (such as number not in use) or asked for input.Recordings asking for input were either  test numbers,  voice mails,  teleconferencing services or they could not be identified, thus  unknown (waiting for input).\n In total, only 3% of calls were answered.Out of these, 69% were identified as interesting.Thus only 2% of all calls got an interesting answer.\n  As the large majority of interesting recordings that wait for input were unknown, I decided to classify them further.The classification was done by identical recording content.Different recordings inside categories are called variants.Based on this classification, there are 74 unique interesting answers.\n The category of unknown recordings that wait for caller input contained 16 different variants.There were 2 different test number variants.The voice mail category contained 23 different variants and there were 24 different variants in the teleconference category.All fax machines sound the same to my ears, while there were 7 different songs played at my wardialing setup.Finally, both unknown machines sounded identical to me.\n   I hypothesize that all interesting recordings, except fax machines and unknown machines, are services offered by Private Branch Exchanges (PBXs).PBXs are telephone systems usually used by businesses that switch calls between multiple users and which can offer additional services such as voice mail and teleconferencing.\n There was a large number of answers from  Unknown (waiting for input), systems waiting for input that did not hint at what service they provide.Part of them ask for a PIN code or menu option using a dial-pad, others for voice commands.\n The ones asking for PIN could be for example voicemail boxes or teleconferencing services.Maybe they could be authentications to remote-controlled PBXs too?The only ways to find out would be to ask someone or trying to brute force the codes.Brute forcing is however illegal.\n  The ones asking for voice commands were bots.There was one Finnish and one English bot.They could be investigated further by interacting with them.\n   The former announces that it is an ICS test platform and proceeds to offer DTMF and FAX testing.The latter test service seems to belong to Twilio, an American communication platform provider.It offers DTMF testing, CL readback, echo test, and an SMS menu.\n Voice mail is still used.Part of the recordings were business voice mails asking for customer feedback or contact details.The rest were ordinary ones simply asking for messages after the beep.\n Teleconferencing was a popular service offered in among the recognized interesting recordings.Most of them seemed to be offered by businesses.The exact use cases of the teleconferencing services were not revealed.They could be company internal or aimed at external users.\n  11 Calls were answered with only  music.The music could indicate something, such as being in queue for some service.All music variants except for one sounded like generic elevator music that could be the default hold music in PBXs.\n  Two calls were answered identically by some  unknown machine.It was not possible to identify what kind of machines they are from the recording alone.They sound electromechanical.\n  There was a single response that was present in 1074 answered calls (91% of all interesting answers) and that waits for the caller to interact with itself.It says \u201cTervetuloa palveluun\u201d (Welcome to the service) followed by repeating \u201cAnna tunnusluku\u201d (Please give access code).The machine does not give any hint of what kind of service it is.\n I contacted Finnish telecommunications company Elisa in hopes they could identify this service.This post will be updated once I get an answer.\n  2 unknown machines sound electromechanical.These mystery machines sound like something out of  Evan Doorbell\u2019s tapes.I contacted Evan in hopes he will recognize the machines and will update this post in case he does.\n   This same recording was played at my wardialing setup on two different numbers.I was very surprised to hear this bizarre message about the end of the world and a zombie apocalypse when listening to the recordings.\n Googling the numbers or the sentences on the recording did not tell me what this is.The recordings sound like captchas.Note that I pressed no touch tones!\n  Maple confirmation message for Clevercrossing.There were 6 of these.What could this be?A confirmation message for what?\n   English speech bot that does not understand silence and is going to escalate my call:\n      Based on my results, there are private and business telephones, fax machines, PBXs, and unidentified systems.The PBXs serve for example as teleconferencing systems, test numbers, and voice mails.Some PBXs may also have other purposes, but this research was not enough to find out what.\n The systems I was not able to identify, such as the unknown machines and the unknown PBX services, could turn out to be something unexpected.Therefore if you know what they are, please contact me!You can find a link to the recordings at the end of this post.\n I cannot fully answer the original question, because of the narrow number space selection and relatively small sample size.My exercise thus serves better as a peek into what kind of systems there are in the Finnish freephone number space in 2021.\n I only called the numbers and passively listened for 60 seconds.It would be interesting to attempt interacting with the discovered services somehow and see how they react.\n Another idea would be to wardial other phone number spaces with the same methodology.The E164 numbering plan states that phone numbers of length 5 digits are still in use for older assignments.Therefore, it is a promising target to discover older services.As a bonus, this number space is sufficiently small to call through in a reasonable time.However, this range may contain service numbers that charge premium rates.\n  All raw recordings marked interesting in the sorting figure, except voice mail, are available  here.\n Voice mails are not published as part of them contain a recording of the owners themselves or the owner\u2019s number is being read by the recording.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 20:28:10", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

Rooftop bouquets of dirty satellite dishes, jumbled architectural styles united by peeling paint, variously shaped (and largely face-masked) life-forms jostling on the sidewalk\u2014each sign of shabby modernity feels like something I glimpsed in childhood while hypnotized by George Lucas. In the director\u2019s 1977 space fantasy, wizards lived in what appeared to be crumbling stucco huts, and moon-size superweapons had onboard trash compactors. As a kid, I believed that Earth was just another planet in Lucas\u2019s universe. Today, I\u2019m still susceptible to that lovely illusion.\n The  Star Wars franchise offers action and escapism, but re-enchanting our own world was always its greatest trick. As Luke Skywalker rises from backwater farmhand to galactic savior over the course of the first three films, audiences gain a visceral sense of why the galaxy he lives in is worth saving. Debris-strewn sets convey that exotic planets have history and commerce. Silly-looking critters and robots carry themselves with dignity and purpose.  A supernatural \u201cForce\u201d hums throughout the interstellar menagerie. Viewers come to feel a humanistic, or even animistic, connection.  Star Wars immerses you in the awesome knowledge that peripheral things\u2014the neighbors you don\u2019t understand, the buildings you don\u2019t notice\u2014have their own sagas.\n  Right now,  Star Wars is at a turning point. Lucas\u2019s original vision famously inspired an era of big-budget blockbuster movies whose creators, just as famously, eventually ran out of new ideas and came to rely on sequels and spin-offs. Inevitably,  Star Wars itself succumbed to that fate. After releasing  a divisive trio of prequels around the turn of the millennium, in 2012 Lucas sold his franchise to Disney, Hollywood\u2019s chief recycler of old stories. Fresh  Star Wars films began to roll out in 2015. Though early acclaim and profits were impressive, creative troubles began to hurt the bottom line. In 2019,  dismayed reviews and relatively soft ticket sales greeted  The Rise of Skywalker, the finale of a trilogy set 30 years after the action of the first films. Around that time, Disney\u2019s CEO, Bob Iger, announced a moviemaking \u201chiatus\u201d for  Star Wars.\n Had Lucas\u2019s galaxy lost its power, or had its new stewards simply mismanaged it? The recent success of a remarkable  Star Wars television series suggests the latter. When the streaming-TV service Disney+ launched in late 2019, it featured  The Mandalorian, which picks up five years after the events of the original trilogy, and follows the adventures of a mysterious mercenary who has sworn never to take off his helmet. By the end of Season 2, a critical consensus had emerged: It was the best live-action  Star Wars product to arrive since the early 1980s. Millions of viewers cooed over the short-statured enigma known to fans as Baby Yoda, who has a price on his adorable head for unknown reasons. As  The Mandalorian\u2019s laconic and lethal hero travels from one planet to the next, the sublime feeling of immersion that laced Lucas\u2019s early movies reemerges. To watch the show and then look back at the sweep of  Star Wars history is to understand where that feeling comes from\u2014and why most of Hollywood\u2019s hero-driven, special-effects-laden fantasies never attain it.\n of  The Mandalorian unspools like a thin, near-invisible thread: Each week, the protagonist completes a discrete quest that unobtrusively points the way toward the next quest. The pleasure of watching lies very much in the journey and not the destination. This episodic, open-ended style of entertainment is a hallmark of dramatic TV\u2014but it\u2019s also very  Star Wars. Soon after its initial success, the first movie was retitled  Episode IV\u2014A New Hope because Lucas wanted viewers to feel as though the film were one chapter in an ongoing Saturday-morning serial. In the new book   Secrets of the Force: The Complete, Uncensored, Unauthorized Oral History of Star Wars, by Edward Gross and Mark A. Altman, Lucas says this of his work on the first film \u200a: \u201cIt\u2019s always been what you might call a good man in search of a story.\u201d\n What Lucas means is that when conceiving  Star Wars, he dreamed first of visuals, concepts, and feelings\u2014not of plot. He felt drawn to make \u201ca movie in outer space like  Flash Gordon used to be. Ray guns, running around in spaceships, shooting at each other.\u201d He also wanted to mash up tropes from samurai films, Westerns, and spy flicks. Above all, he wanted a look and feel that prized \u201ccredibility\u201d rather than the \u201cclean,\u201d sleek sci-fi of 1950s serials and  2001: A Space Odyssey. His own days working in a greasy mechanics\u2019 shop, plus the thought of NASA\u2019s Apollo capsule returning from the moon full of \u201ccandy wrappers and old Tang jars,\u201d informed that vision.\n Without a narrative he was burning to tell, Lucas had trouble turning such notions into a workable screenplay. He wrote multiple, overlong drafts that each radically refigured its characters, arcs, and themes. Eventually, he arrived at a relatively straightforward tale modeled on ancient legends. Lucas had been reading the work of Joseph Campbell, a literary scholar who identified a \u201cmonomyth,\u201d with a predictable structure, occurring across cultures throughout the centuries.  Star Wars would be a Chosen One story; Luke Skywalker was like King Arthur or Siddhartha Gautama. This blueprint, with its prescribed wise-mentor figures, talismanic weapons, and trusty sidekicks, helped make the mess of a script gel.\n  Lucas\u2019s reverse-engineered fairy tale resonated with audiences, but  Star Wars aficionados tend to overrate plot when explaining his success; books have been written about the profundity of Luke\u2019s search for identity. In the new oral history, the critic Roy Morton articulates conventional wisdom when he argues that Lucas\u2019s \u201cmost significant creative decision in crafting the script\u201d was to draw from myths. Disney\u2019s chief  Star Wars executive, Kathleen Kennedy, says that \u201cwhat was really important to [Lucas]\u2014and certainly important to me\u2014was story.\u201d Whenever  Star Wars films have faltered with audiences, commentators have blamed shoddy storytelling: the needless complexity of Lucas\u2019s prequels,  the inconsistent logic of Disney\u2019s sequels.\n Yet the hero\u2019s journey in the original movies was always sketchy. The opening 15 minutes of  A New Hope feature strikingly few recognizable human characters, and Luke Skywalker is usually the least interesting thing in any scene that follows. A lot of the film\u2019s suspense derives more from wondering what the movie\u2019s  about\u2014the touristic curiosity of \u201cWhere is this going?\u201d\u2014than from tracking clues to how Luke will fulfill his destiny.  Secrets of the Force documents that the trilogy\u2019s iconic twists, which would seem key to choreographing a monomyth, nearly weren\u2019t filmed. In the shooting script for  A New Hope, the mentor figure, Obi-Wan Kenobi, survives to the end rather than dying midway through. Some drafts of the second film,  The Empire Strikes Back, don\u2019t indicate that the evil Darth Vader is Luke\u2019s father. Glorious though such surprises are, Lucas\u2019s work wasn\u2019t driven by them.\n In fact, the story crescendos are compelling because they double as world-building. Learning who Darth Vader really is raises a host of tantalizing questions about the history of the galaxy (not least,  how does someone become Darth Vader?). Kenobi\u2019s early-movie references to mysterious concepts such as \u201cthe dark times\u201d\u2014exposition left unfinished once he dies\u2014also spark rich intrigue. \u201cLucas makes movies that are intentionally designed to have holes in them that need to be filled later,\u201d the producer Brian Volk-Weiss says in the oral history. He\u2019s right except for one thing: Do they need to be filled in? Many a mediocre  Star Wars product has arisen from trying to define every entry in the galactic glossary. The original films work precisely because of the holes.\n They also work because Lucas, as a filmmaker, was fastidious about blending novelty with naturalism. Directing the initial movie, he insisted that the sets be streaked with scum and scorch marks. He spliced together  footage of World War II dogfights and then invented special effects to make space battles look like those dogfights. When the time came to shoot, Mark Hamill (who plays Luke) first delivered his lines with campy panache\u2014but Lucas encouraged him to be more low-key. \u201cThese actors believed the world they were in,\u201d Liam Neeson, a star of 1999\u2019s  The Phantom Menace, says in  Secrets of the Force. \u201cMark Hamill jumps into his speeder and\u2014phooph!\u2014he\u2019s off ... To them, it was everyday stuff.\u201d\n Such far-out realism has rarely been achieved since then. In the dreary prequels, Lucas went overboard with then-novel computer-generated imagery, losing the lived-in feel he\u2019d once prized. The Disney sequels are too frantically paced\u2014and too packed with winks to old  Star Wars films\u2014for viewers to settle in with the new sets, creatures, and costumes. Both of those later trilogies told strenuously mythic stories: The prequels followed the tragic transformation of a hero into a villain, and the Disney movies amounted to another Chosen One tale. The flaws of their scripts have been rightly scrutinized, but fixing those flaws would not solve the more fundamental failures of execution. When  Star Wars is bad, its galaxy feels like a thing on a screen\u2014not a place you can go.\n of  The Mandalorian, thankfully, is sturdy, like well-worn concrete. The hero flies a rickety spaceship modeled on a \u201970s warplane. Baby Yoda\u2019s twitching puppet ears convey the expressive range of actual toddlers. Most important, the showrunner, Jon Favreau, has absorbed the take-your-time, exploratory ethos of Lucas\u2019s first trilogy. One early episode spends 10 dialogue-free minutes following the Mandalorian as he tries to survive on an arid planet. Two episodes later, the Mandalorian arrives in a forested village where locals harvest bioluminescent krill from ponds. He doesn\u2019t just save the village from a hostile tribe\u2019s attacks. He moves in to live the  Star Wars simple life for a few weeks.\n Such wanderings do have a mythic quality. The Mandalorian and Baby Yoda are an odd couple: protector and charge, father and son, man and beast. There is also a running plot, involving a black-armored arch-villain, that fulfills the demands of modern blockbusters to set up future spin-offs (10 other  Star Wars TV shows were announced in December). When the second season culminated in a CGI-assisted cameo from the original-trilogy cast,  some critics fretted that the show was about to devolve into Hollywood hackery. But thus far, archetypal storytelling and serialized intrigue\u2014ingredients often misused in franchise-driven entertainment\u2014have mainly just anchored Favreau\u2019s careful creative riffing. If the miracle of  The Mandalorian continues, viewers of future seasons will only rarely notice an overdetermined hand of fate guiding the action. They\u2019ll instead continue to be caught up in individual moments.\n To cheer for a Hollywood product that emphasizes look and feel rather than story and character may sound superficial. But in life, aesthetics are not incidental. The dents on a vehicle tell a story. So does the glint in a stranger\u2019s eyes. Tidy plots are scarce, and populations do not readily divide into Chosen Ones and Unchosen Ones.  Star Wars has proved that mass entertainment can wake us up to such realities. My favorite of the many arcs in  The Mandalorian involves a froglike creature carrying her unhatched eggs to another planet. Because the alien doesn\u2019t speak his language, the Mandalorian treats her coldly\u2014until she commandeers a droid\u2019s translation system and delivers a desperate plea for help. Watching that scene jangled my empathy so much that I began to look even at subway rats with a sense of wonder.

If that person launched into a monologue beginning, \u201cIt is the district of glorified dancing girls and millionaire playboys and, on a different plane, of dime-a-dance hostesses and pleasure-seeking clerks. Here, too, in a permanent moralizing tableau, appear the extremes of success and failure characteristic of Broadway\u2019s spectacular professions: gangsters and racketeers, panhandlers and derelicts, youthful stage stars and aging burlesque comedians, world heavyweight champions and once-acclaimed beggars,\u201d and then that person recounted the history of every theater and club, the development of the area\u2019s rapid public transit, and the origin of the phrase \u201cthe Great White Way\u201d (coined, supposedly, in 1901 by the adman O. J. Gude), all in a tone both disdainful and celebratory of the famed intersection that \u201clights the clouds above Manhattan with a glow like that of a dry timber fire\u201d\u2014you would know what it was like to read the  American Guides, a curious series of books that appeared during the last years of the Great Depression. Specifically, you\u2019d know what it was like to read the  New York City Guide, which was published in 1939. And you\u2019d be no closer to Times Square.\n  Alongside New York City, there was a guide for every state (48 of them then), plus the District of Columbia, the Alaska Territory, Puerto Rico, many cities and towns, locales such as Death Valley, and routes such as U.S. 1. The public bought them, expecting concise and functional travel companions. But the hefty  American Guides were something else.\n   These books sprawled. They hoarded and gossiped and sat you down for a lecture. They seemed to address multiple readers at once from multiple perspectives. Most were divided into three sections. First, perplexed readers paged through essays on history, industry, folkways, and other subjects. Then came profiles of notable cities and towns, and finally, a collection of automobile tours across the state. The tours highlighted scenic overlooks and recreation spots, but also infamous massacres, labor strikes, witches, gunfighters, Continental Army spies, Confederate deserters, shipwrecks, slave rebellions, famous swindlers, and forgotten poets. They traveled through towns with bizarre names and towns founded by religious cults. They paused for every old-timer\u2019s story that could be fastened to a patch of ground. They mentioned all the places where Washington ever slept (or so it seemed). They included research on subjects of little use to a traveler (the structure of local government, a state\u2019s literary residents) but barely noted diners, motels, and gas stations. They were rich and weird and frustrating. They guided tourists across the land but also deep into the national character, into a past that was assembled from the mythic and the prosaic, the factual and the farcical. The tours seemed less accessories for motorists than rambling day trips through the unsorted mind of the republic.\n  This shaggy opulence, this Americana maximalism, made the guides unusual. But their provenance made them remarkable. They weren\u2019t issued by some erratic publisher or obsessive tourist association: They were created by the federal government through the Federal Writers\u2019 Project, a division of the New Deal\u2019s Works Progress Administration. The  American Guides were among the unlikeliest weapons in the improvised arsenal that the Roosevelt administration brought to bear upon the Depression.\n  Launched soon after the formation of the WPA in 1935, the FWP provided work for unemployed writers, whether professional or aspiring, competent or otherwise. The program wasn\u2019t huge, comparatively. The entire WPA employed more than 2 million people a month, on average, while the FWP typically had 4,500 to 5,200 workers and peaked at 6,686, all scattered in offices around the country. They came from a range of professions: mostly white-collar workers whose jobs had disappeared and who were better suited to desk labor than, say, draining malarial swampland, along with poets and novelists, including some significant writers whose fame had been eclipsed by the Depression and others who had yet to become famous. (Richard Wright and Zora Neale Hurston were among those who collected an FWP paycheck.)\n   The FWP was a work-relief program, and its primary mission was to help writers survive the Depression, while putting cash into circulation and contributing, however modestly, to the economic recovery. But it was also a literary endeavor of unprecedented scale. When the FWP was finally dissolved, along with the rest of the WPA, in 1943,  Time magazine gave it the epitaph \u201cthe biggest literary project in history\u201d\u2014a claim that does not seem to be disputed.\n  The project might have been a disaster. Many doubted that staffing an unwieldy government bureaucracy with temperamental and often desperate writers\u2014not a few impaired by heavy drinking, professional jealousy, political sectarianism, or all three\u2014could lead to any good outcome. (The journalist Dorothy Thompson remarked, \u201cProject? For Writers? Absurd!\u201d and the poet W. H. Auden, unknowingly echoing Thompson, later called the entire WPA arts program \u201cone of the noblest and most absurd undertakings ever attempted by a state.\u201d) But from 1937, when the first guides appeared, to the project\u2019s end, the FWP managed to produce at least 1,000 publications and gather reams of unused material. (Some of these manuscripts, especially individual life histories and  the testimonials of formerly enslaved people, would be treasured and interrogated by future scholars.) Each successful publication chipped away at assumptions about the FWP, proving that it was no hopeless boondoggle for failed writers and unimaginative hacks. Reviewers were generally impressed, finding that the books far surpassed their expectations. The guides seemed, in their own odd and beguiling way, to represent a distinct aesthetic achievement.\n  The critic Alfred Kazin ended his book  On Native Grounds\u2014written contemporaneously with the FWP\u2014by taking up the \u201cliterature of nationhood\u201d that had emerged most forcefully after the crash of 1929. As Kazin described it, this genre comprised an upsurge of disparate writing \u201cwhose subject was the American scene and whose drive always was the need \u2026 to chart America and to possess it.\u201d Edmund Wilson\u2019s book of reportage  The American Jitters fit this pattern by issuing dispatches from the great national unraveling. So did  You Have Seen Their Faces, a documentary record of the southern poor, written by Erskine Caldwell and photographed by Margaret Bourke-White, which forced an introduction between its readers and their often-overlooked fellow citizens. Books such as these had literary ancestors in Ralph Waldo Emerson, who struggled to conjure up a distinct and meaningful American spirit at his desk, and in Walt Whitman, who chased that spirit down and sought to become possessed by it.\n The  American Guides epitomized this new literature. Kazin singled them out for praise and insisted on their literary merit (the superior volumes, anyway), perhaps because he knew that they had surpassed the low expectations of so many reviewers. In 1942, the books were still fresh\u2014several had only just been published\u2014but Kazin had a clear view of where they belonged in his story of American literature:\n The WPA state guides, seemingly only a makeshift, a stratagem of administrative relief policy to tide a few thousand people along and keep them working, a business of assigning individuals of assorted skills and interests to map the country, mile by mile, resulted in an extraordinary contemporary epic. Out of the need to find something to say about every community and the country around it, out of the vast storehouse of facts behind the guides\u2014geological, geographic, meteorological, ethnological, historical, political, sociological, economic\u2014there emerged an America unexampled in density and regional diversity \u2026 More than any other literary form in the thirties, the WPA writers\u2019 project, by illustrating how much so many collective skills could do to uncover the collective history of the country, set the tone of the period.\n  The  American Guides, in other words, could not be dismissed as mere curiosities\u2014or as evidence of the New Dealers\u2019 mania for spending tax dollars in creative ways. The books were key to understanding the historical moment, because the guides, as Kazin put it, had become \u201ca repository as well as a symbol of the reawakened American sense of its own history.\u201d\n  The guides\u2019 wandering, capacious, and yet startlingly resonant take on the American experience explains why so many people, including myself, have been drawn to these books and the story of how they came to be\u2014how it was that the federal government ended up in the publishing business, with such a peculiar list of titles to show for it. As a historical undertaking and a collective editorial project\u2014created under conditions of enormous strain, at a scale never attempted, by workers grappling with the stresses of poverty and, for many, their own inexperience\u2014the  American Guides were a triumph. But the books themselves are not triumphalist. They carry a whiff of New Deal optimism, sure, but for the most part they resist those signature American habits of boosterism and aggressive national mythologizing. As the young novelist Robert Cantwell wrote in  The New Republic in 1939, the guides are \u201ca grand, melancholy, formless, democratic anthology of frustration and idiosyncrasy, a majestic roll call of national failure, a terrible and yet engaging corrective to the success stories that dominate our literature.\u201d\n  Cantwell was right. For books that are ostensibly travel guides, the FWP publications have a habit of wandering off\u2014steering, more often than not, down forgotten back roads and toward the dead ends of American history. But that was the point. The guides do form \u201ca majestic roll call of national failure,\u201d as Cantwell put it, and also more than that. They are melancholic at times, but they are exuberant, suggestive, slapdash, overdetailed, and overconfident too. The spirit of the guides, in other words, is multitudinous and democratic\u2014they have a fundamentally public orientation to match the public enterprise that created them. They don\u2019t offer one way of looking at a state but several. They contain many voices but, as books for travelers, they convey essentially a single invitation to explore, to roam, to inquire.\n  These books, with their range of perspectives, emerged from the work of a diverse group of writers\u2014some who were among the boldest names in the history of 20th-century American literature and others who never quite escaped the pages of little magazines and obscure manifestos. These writers, whatever their relative renown, labored alongside thousands of others whose contributions are difficult to trace but who made up the majority of FWP workers, the ones who showed up to offices or issued field reports from everywhere in the country. They all experienced life on the project in different, and often totally opposing, ways. They loved the work; they felt like hacks. They saw the FWP as launching their careers; they saw it as a sad and bitter end. Black writers were marginalized, and yet a remarkable group of them produced groundbreaking studies of African American life. Native Americans were also largely excluded as workers in roles across the FWP, though nearly every guide includes references to their history. These passages are typically bundled up with sections about archaeology rather than appearing in essays on the contemporary scene; the guides, in other words, are often guilty of relegating Native Americans to the past rather than portraying them as active participants in the present. The guides themselves, meant to convey an argument about inclusion and pluralism, were sometimes undermined by their own creators\u2014and the compromises of language and of emphasis involved in their creation.\n  By plucking its workers from all corners of the land, the FWP inevitably became a showcase for their ideas, aspirations, and prejudices. All the tensions of American society in the \u201930s were stuffed between the lines of the project\u2019s books and pamphlets. The program was a roiling and seething experiment, and even its participants could not agree on what it all meant: Was it a noble vehicle for progressive patriotism, a fount of radical propaganda, or a bureaucratic instrument for managing social strife and whitewashing history? Was it all of these? The guides don\u2019t provide an obvious answer. Instead, they offer a snapshot of a nation reckoning with urgent questions\u2014about historical progress, the role of government, and the future of democracy itself\u2014at a moment when all the old answers seemed to be dissolving.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 20:26:58", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "rust,\u65c5\u884c,weird,\u793e\u4f1a", "title":

", "note_en": "Apple    AAPL  1.27%  is stepping up its fight to maintain tight controls over which apps can be installed onto customers\u2019 iPhones, as political pressure grows in Washington, D.C. and Brussels to upend those restrictions.\n  In a report released Wednesday, the company argues that allowing users to download apps directly onto their iPhones without having to use Apple\u2019s App Store would harm customers by threatening privacy protections, complicating parental controls and potentially exposing users\u2019 data to ransomware attacks.\n  Apple\u2019s defense of its mobile operating system, or iOS, comes ahead of an expected debate Wednesday in the House Judiciary Committee on a package of  bills aimed at reining in the nation\u2019s largest tech companies.\n    Provisions in one of the bills, known as the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, could effectively give Apple\u2019s customers broader control over which apps to download on their devices. It could prohibit Apple from continuing to block a practice known as sideloading, in which users install apps directly onto their iPhones without having to go through the company\u2019s App Store. In Europe, the Digital Markets Act was  introduced in December and is making its way through the legislative process. It too includes provisions to open the door to sideloading.\n    Apple isn\u2019t the only tech company taking issue with the House committee\u2019s package of bills. Brian Huseman,  Amazon.com    AMZN  1.49%  vice president of public policy, said in a statement Tuesday that the proposed legislative language \u201cwould have significant negative effects on the hundreds of thousands of American small- and medium-sized businesses that sell in our store, and tens of millions of consumers who buy products from  Amazon  \u201d He urged the committee to delay action and assess the impact of the bills.\n  Apple\u2019s report before the committee\u2019s Wednesday meeting follows comments by Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook during a virtual appearance at a Paris tech conference last week, in which he said that sideloading would damage privacy and security.\n  The Coalition for App Fairness, an advocacy group that includes Epic Games Inc. and  Spotify Technology  praised the legislation to allow sideloading. The group\u2019s executive director, Meghan DiMuzio, called it \u201can important step as momentum builds to hold platforms accountable for their anticompetitive behavior.\u201d Epic and Spotify both  have battled with Apple over  its rules regarding the App Store.\n    Apple takes a cut of as much as 30% of revenue generated by apps distributed through its digital store and imposes rules on content and other practices. The App Store was a major driver of  its $16.9 billion in services revenue generated in the most recent quarter.\n  \u201cAllowing sideloading would degrade the security of the iOS platform and expose users to serious security risks not only on third-party app stores, but also on the App Store,\u201d Apple said in the report Wednesday. \u201cBecause of the large size of the iPhone user base and the sensitive data stored on their phones\u2014photos, location data, health and financial information\u2014allowing sideloading would spur a flood of new investment into attacks on the platform.\u201d\n  Mr. Cook has made privacy a cornerstone of Apple\u2019s product pitch in recent years, rolling out additional tools  to make it harder for other companies to use iPhone users\u2019 data for profit. He has often drawn a contrast between Apple\u2019s business model of mostly selling devices and computers to that of tech rivals who make their fortunes from online ads, such as  Alphabet  Google.\n  Mr. Cook last week said Google\u2019s mobile operating system, Android, was at a greater risk of malware than Apple\u2019s. Android allows sideloading, and Google has defended its security in the past. Google\u2019s most recent transparency report said less than 0.2%\u00a0of Android devices have installed a malicious app through Google Play.\n  Apple\u2019s business practices regarding its App Store and third-party software were at the heart of a courtroom drama in May that pitted the company against one of the world\u2019s most popular videogame makers, Epic Games. The antitrust lawsuit filed by Epic aims to allow it to offer its games on Apple devices outside the App Store. Epic has said that Apple improperly controls the distribution of software onto devices it sells and forces developers to use its in-app payment system.\n  Epic said that the practice of sideloading on iPhones would be no different from what Apple allows on its PCs, where users can easily download software.\n  Apple pushed back against that argument. The company told the judge that threats against the iPhone are unique because of its nature as a phone and said that its process of vetting apps before distribution helped ensure security. The judge is expected to issue her ruling in the coming weeks.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 19:42:20", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

Thus, their debuting console will keep its design  simple and  practical&amp;mldr Although this may come with a cost!\n   The main processor is one of those \u2018x designed by y, based on z and second-sourced from w\u2019 which is a bit dense to summarise in a few sentences, so why don\u2019t we start with some historical context?\n The early nineties were marked by a change in the fates of many popular CPUs. The once-leading 8-bit CPUs, such as the  Z80 and  6502, were already out of spotlight and Motorola\u2019s famous  68000, along with other  16-bit designs that enjoyed success in the late 80s, had become candidates for replacement. Even at this time in the PC world, Tanenbaum, in his celebrated debate with Torvalds, gave Intel\u2019s x86 architecture only  five more years until its demise from the home market.\n At first it may look as if technological development had hit a wall at this point. But in reality there was a new wave of relatively-unknown CPUs making their way into mainstream devices. Many of these designs had originated in academia, and so existed to prove particular sets of design ideas. Examples of next-gen CPUs at this point included:\n  All of these processors had something in common: They followed the  Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) discipline, which radically shifted how these chips had to be designed and programmed. One rule of RISC CPUs dictated that a single instruction can\u2019t mix memory with register operations, allowing hardware designers to simplify the circuitry that executes instructions&amp;mldr and then enhance it with parallelism techniques.\n In the late 80s, MIPS CPUs became a topic of conversion after being adopted (and later acquired) by Silicon Graphics Incorporated (SGI) to power their equipment. SGI was an influential innovator in the computer graphics market, especially with the development of  hardware-accelerated vertex pipelines, whose task was originally carried out by software (within the CPU).\n During the development of the PlayStation, MIPS was offering the  R3000A series of processors. These were 32-bit machines and part of their low-end catalogue. Consequently, while the R3000A was not part of the flagship lineup (unlike the R4000, which  others would later choose), it was an attractive investment in terms of cost.\n Sony designed their audio and graphics chips in-house, but they still needed the leading chip that could drive those two. The selected CPU had to be powerful enough to show off the  impressive capabilities of Sony\u2019s chips, but also affordable to keep the console at a competitive price.\n At the same time,  LSI Logic (a semiconductor manufacturer) was providing a \u2018build-your-own\u2019 CPU program to businesses. This service was referred to as  CoreWare and it enabled clients to build their own CPU packages by choosing a series of building blocks. Part of the CoreWare library included the \u2018CW33300\u2019 block, a CPU core derived from the LSI LR33300, an off-the-shelf CPU chip which LSI also commercialised.\n Now, where am I going with all this? It turns out LSI\u2019s LR33300 and CW33300 are a  binary-compatible version of the MIPS R3000A family. Their architectures slightly differ in some areas but the programming interface (MIPS I ISA) remains the same.\n In the end, Sony commissioned LSI to build their CPU package. They chose the CW33000, changed some bits and combined it with other blocks to form the chip you find on the PlayStation\u2019s motherboard.\n   The  MIPS I ISA: The first version of the MIPS instruction set. Among many things, words are 32-bit long and the instruction set includes multiplication and division instructions.\n 32 general-purpose registers and  2 multiplication/division registers: These are 32-bit as well. One general-purpose register is always zero (R0), which is common in RISC processors.\n 32-bit data bus: In the PS1, the data bus forks into two buses. Sub Bus (16/8-bit) \u2192 Connects to the rest of the chips and I/O. This bus is bridged by the  Bus Interface Unit, which also enables access to special ports of the GPU and SPU.\n 32-bit address bus: Up to 4 GB of physical memory (i.e. RAM, memory-mapped I/O, etc) can be accessed.\n 5-stage pipeline: Up to five instructions can be executed simultaneously (a detailed explanation can be found in a  previous article).\n 4 KB instruction cache and  1 KB of data cache: The data cache also works as  Scratchpad (fast RAM), meaning that it can have other uses apart from behaving as L1 cache. Instruction cache can be \u2018isolated\u2019 instead, allowing the program to manipulate it directly.\n To do something meaningful, Sony provided  2 MB of RAM for general-purpose use. Curiously enough, they fitted  External Data Out (EDO) chips on the motherboard. These are slightly more efficient than typical DRAM, obtaining lower latency.\n  At some point, any subsystem (graphics, audio or CD) will require large chunks of data at a fast rate. However, the CPU will not always be able to keep up with the demand.\n For this reason, the CD-ROM Controller, MDEC, GPU, SPU and the Parallel port have access to an exclusive  DMA controller whenever they require it. DMA takes control of the main bus and performs a data transfer. The resulting rate is a lot faster than relying on the CPU, though the latter is still needed to set up a DMA transfer.\n Also, bear in mind that once DMA kicks in, the CPU can\u2019t access the main bus. This means the CPU will be idling unless it\u2019s got something in Scratchpad to keep it busy!\n  Like other MIPS R3000-based CPUs, the CW33000 supports configurations with up to four coprocessors, Sony customised it with three:\n Identified as \u2018CP0\u2019, the  System Control Coprocessor is a common block found on MIPS CPUs. In R3000-based systems, like this one, the CP0 controls how the cache is implemented. Thus, enabling direct access to data cache (in the form of \u2018Scratchpad\u2019) and instruction cache (with \u2018cache isolation\u2019). The control coprocessor is also responsible for handling interrupts, exceptions and breakpoints, the latter is useful during debugging.\n Wait, shouldn\u2019t co-processors only  expand CPU functions? Why is CP0 tightly coupled to the CPU?\n Indeed, R3000 cores depend on the system control coprocessor to be able to make use of many components, but whether this should be \u2018legal\u2019 or not comes down to the interpretation of the word \u2018co-processor\u2019. According to MIPS, a co-processor is not strictly an optional part of the CPU, it may also command the CPU\u2019s surroundings (cache, interrupts, etc). Hence, a co-processor can be an integral part of the system. This is just something to bear in mind while talking about MIPS-related systems.\n Later  R4000-based systems incorporated a Memory Management Unit (MMU) and a Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) into this block, thereby increasing its capabilities and taking up  new roles.\n The \u2018CP2\u2019 or  Geometry Transformation Engine (GTE) is a special math processor that accelerates vector and matrix calculations.\n While only operating fixed-point types, it still provides useful operations for 3D graphics such as:\n Depth Cueing and colour value from a light source (used for lighting and colour operations).\n Z/depth average (I suspect this is for the \u2018ordering table\u2019, more details in the \u2018Graphics\u2019 section).\n You don\u2019t have to remember all these to follow the rest of the article! Just keep in mind that the GTE will be taking care of the first stages of the graphics pipeline, such as 3D projection, lighting and clipping. This will help to generate the required data that will be sent to the GPU for rendering.\n The  Motion Decoder, also called \u2018MDEC\u2019 or \u2018Macroblock Decoder\u2019, is another processor living next to the CPU. This time, it decompresses \u2018Macroblocks\u2019 into a format the GPU can understand. A Macroblock is a data structure that houses a picture with similar encoding to JPEG.\n The MDEC decompresses bitmaps made of 8x8 24 bpp pixels at a time. Walker\u2019s programming guide states the MDEC can compute 9,000 macroblocks per second. This would allow to stream a 320x240 px  full-motion video (FMV) at 30 frames per second.\n DMA is used to send compressed data through CD-ROM \u2192 RAM \u2192 MDEC. The same path is taken in the opposite direction, though in this case, the destination is VRAM.\n While this component is sitting inside the SoC and shares the same data bus, it\u2019s not a MIPS co-processor, so the CPU/DMA access it through the memory map (as opposed to intercepting instructions).\n For more info about the MDEC unit, I suggest checking out Sabin\u2019s and Czeka\u0144ski\u2019s resources (see \u2018Sources\u2019 section).\n  So far, we got a \u2018CP0\u2019 and a \u2018CP2\u2019, but  where\u2019s the \u2018CP1\u2019? Well, that\u2019s reserved for a  Floating Point Unit (FPU) and I\u2019m afraid Sony didn\u2019t provide one. This doesn\u2019t mean the CPU can\u2019t perform arithmetic with decimal numbers, it just won\u2019t be fast enough (software-emulated FPU) or too precise (fixed-point arithmetic instead).\n Game logic (involving physics, collision detection, etc) still can get around with fixed-point arithmetic. Fixed-point encoding stores decimal numbers with an immutable number of decimal places. This implies a loss in precision after certain operations, but remember, this is a video-game console, not a professional flight simulator. Hence, the precision-performance trade-off is somewhat feasible.\n By the way, sometimes I mix up \u2018fixed-point\u2019, \u2018floating-point\u2019, \u2018decimal\u2019 and \u2018integer\u2019 number types (hopefully not anymore!). If you feel the same, I recommend taking a look at Gabriel Ivancescu\u2019s quick summary (see the \u2018Sources\u2019 section) to quickly refresh those concepts.\n  As we\u2019ve seen before, the CW33300 is a pipelined processor, meaning that it queues up multiple instructions and executes them in parallel at different stages. This hugely improves instruction throughput, but if it\u2019s not controlled properly, it can lead to  pipeline hazards, resulting in computational errors.\n The MIPS I architecture is susceptible to  control hazards and  data hazards, which means that instructions may get executed when they shouldn\u2019t be; and that instructions may operate with outdated data before it\u2019s been updated.\n Any instruction followed by a \u2018branch\u2019 or \u2018jump\u2019 type opcode is executed unconditionally: Thus, developers have to manually fill the pipeline with modest instructions (such as \u2018calculate 0 plus 0\u2019) after the branch or jump to mitigate the hazard. These fillers are called  branch delay slots. Modern CPUs converted this phenomenon into an advantage:  Branch prediction. By adding extra circuitry to detect the hazard, the CPU discards the new computations if the branch/jump condition didn\u2019t meet. But if it did, then the CPU has saved some time.\n \u2018Load\u2019 instructions don\u2019t stall the pipeline until the data arrives: Slow external access like RAM, the CD reader or any other memory-mapped I/O can take a significant number of cycles to read. Hence, fillers are needed to keep the pipeline busy until the values arrive.\n As we can see from the example, some delay slots are filled with meaningful instructions, which perform computations that are not affected by the hazard. Hence, delay slots don\u2019t always imply a waste of cycles.\n In most cases, the compiler will automatically re-arrange instructions to fill in slots, or add useless fillers as a last measure. So, all in all, this phenomenon is a bit of a mixed bag.\n   To recap, a large part of the graphics pipeline is carried out by the GTE. This includes perspective transformation (which projects the 3D space onto a 2D plane using the camera\u2019s perspective) and lighting. The processed data is then sent to  Sony\u2019s proprietary GPU for rendering.\n  The system features  1 MB of VRAM that will be used to store the frame buffer, textures and other resources the GPU will require to render the scene. The CPU can fill this area using DMA.\n The type of chip fitted ( VRAM) is dual-ported, like the  Virtual Boy\u2019s. VRAM uses two 16-bit buses, which enables concurrent access between the CPU/DMA/GPU and the Video encoder.\n  Though in later revisions of this console, Sony switched to  SGRAM chips (the single-ported option using an individual 32-bit data bus).  Boo!&amp;mldr Well, to be fair, each one comes with its pros and cons. One thing for sure, is that due to the timing differences, later games (such as Jet Moto 3) will display glitched graphics when ran on VRAM-based systems. If you want to know the details, Martin Korth\u2019s \u2018Nocash PSX Specifications\u2019 document the different timings and such.\n  If you\u2019ve been reading the  Sega Saturn article, let me tell you that the design of this GPU  a lot simpler!\n Now, to show how a scene is drawn, I\u2019ll mainly use Insomniac\u2019s  Spyro: Year of the Dragon as an example. Please bear in mind that the internal resolution of this game is too cramped (292x217 px), preventing me to clearly dissect it at each stage, so I\u2019ve upscaled it a bit for demonstration purposes. Here is a sample at original scale if you are curious.\n To start with, the CPU sends geometry data (vertices) to the GPU by filling its internal 64 byte FIFO buffer with  commands (up to three). Essentially, a command states how and where to draw one primitive.\n Once the geometry is received,  clipping is applied to skip operations over unseen polygons (residing outside the camera\u2019s viewport).\n The location of the primitive is stated with an X/Y coordinate system pointing to the frame buffer. The PS1\u2019s GPU employs an  integer coordinate model, where each coordinate corresponds to the centre point of a pixel (called  sampling point). In other words, there are no fractional coordinates.\n Just like the  competition, the PS1 doesn\u2019t include any hardware feature that solves the  visibility problem. Nonetheless, the GPU handles sorted polygons by providing an  ordering table: A dedicated table where each entry is indexed using a depth value (also called \u2018Z-value\u2019) and contains the address where the GPU command resides.\n The CPU needs to manually sort the polygons first, and then reference them in the correct entry of the table. Finally, the CPU orders DMA to send the table to the GPU. This process will enable the GPU to render the geometry in the correct order.\n Multiple DMA functions are also provided to assist both CPU and GPU with the creation and traversal of this table.\n Once the commands are decoded by the GPU, it\u2019s time to convert the geometry received (vertices) into pixels. This will enable the system to apply texture mapping, effects and ultimately display it on a two-dimensional panel (your TV or monitor). To do this, the GPU allocates a pixel matrix that is used as a working area, this is called a  frame buffer. Compared to the more complex  Sega Saturn, the GPU only needs a single frame buffer.\n The GPU uses  triangles as primitives to form 3D models. Being the only available primitive means that backgrounds and foregrounds make no difference in terms of composition (both are made of triangles). 2D games inherit the same nature: They are just two triangles joined to form a quadrangle (though the GPU provides routines for constructing sprites automatically).\n The rasterizer is the unit in charge of converting vectors into triangles; and then into pixels. This is done by:\n Analysing the area of the triangle to identify which pixels of the frame buffer they occupy. Any section of the triangle covering the sampling point is turned into a pixel.\n The generated pixels are not written into the frame buffer right away. Instead, they are sent to the next stages of the pipeline for further processing, which we\u2019ll see in the following paragraphs.\n Gouraud shading: Each primitive\u2019s vertex embeds its own light level, then the brightness between each point is automatically interpolated. As you can imagine, the results are more realistic. On the other hand, this algorithm is not available for sprites.\n The reason for having this choice comes down to the fact that flat shading fills ~2.5 times more polygons per second than Gouraud, so it\u2019s important to optimise which polygons need a more realistic shading than others.\n The GPU performs  inverse texture mapping, where the GPU traverses each rasterized pixel and looks for its corresponding pixel in the texture map (called  texel). Texels are calculated by linearly interpolating the texture map (found in VRAM) to conform to the shape of the polygon. The routine used for interpolation is called  Affine Texture Mapping, this technique only operates using 2D coordinates (X/Y values) while discarding the third coordinate (Z/depth) used for perspective.\n Because texture maps rarely have the exact dimension of the rasterized polygon,  aliasing (incorrect results) may appear. This is manifested with unwanted distortions, such as missing or enlarged texels. To remedy this, sophisticated GPUs employ  texture filtering to smooth out (interpolate) sudden colour changes. Now, The PS1\u2019s GPU doesn\u2019t implement any filter, so it resorts to an algorithm named  nearest neighbour to correct scales without smoothing out the results. This is very fast (and cheap) but it also explains why textured models may look \u2018blocky\u2019.\n Once finished, the GPU writes the pixels into the frame buffer area in VRAM, which is in turn picked up by the video encoder and broadcasted to the screen.\n  Let\u2019s take a break now from all this theory. Here are some examples of game characters designed from the ground up for the 3D era, they are interactive so I encourage you to check them out!\n   With the available amount of VRAM (1  whole megabyte), one could allocate a  massive frame buffer of 1024\u00d7512 pixels with 16-bit colours or a  realistic one of 960\u00d7512 pixels with 24-bit colours - allowing to draw the best frames any game has ever shown&amp;mldr This sounds pretty impressive, right? Well, it does raise a couple of issues, for instance:\n Those dimensions will have to be rescaled to follow a standardised definition (i.e. 480 NTSC, 576 PAL) so the video encoder can broadcast it to consumer TVs.\n How is the GPU going to be able to draw anything decent if there isn\u2019t any space left for the rest of the materials (i.e. textures, colour tables, etc)?\n The PS1\u2019s GPU can only draw frame buffers with up to 640\u00d7480 pixels and 16 bpp colours.\n All right, so let\u2019s have a 16 bpp 640x480 buffer instead, which leaves 424 KB of VRAM for materials. So far so good? Again, such resolution may be fine on CRT monitors, but not particularly noticeable on those 90s TVs everyone had at their homes. Then, is there any way to optimise the frame-buffer? Introducing  adjustable frame-buffers.\n In essence, instead of wasting valuable VRAM by using \u2018unappreciated\u2019 resolutions, this console\u2019s GPU allows decreasing the dimensions of the frame buffer to effectively increment the space available for other resources. In \u2018Gears Episode 2\u2019 (see \u2018Sources\u2019 section), Halkun shows a setup that divides the 640x480 frame-buffer into two 320x480 ones, and then relies on a technique called  page-flipping to render multiple scenes at the same time.\n Page-flipping consists of switching the location of the frame for display between the two available whenever the game wants it, allowing the game to render one scene while displaying another. Thus, hiding any flickering effect and improving loading times (something that the player will certainly appreciate!).\n Overall, Halkun\u2019s layout only consumes 600 KB of VRAM. The rest (424 KB) can be used to store colour lookup tables and textures that, combined with  2 KB of texture cache available, results in a very convenient and efficient setup.\n Finally, it is worth mentioning that VRAM can be mapped using  multiple colour depths simultaneously, meaning that programmers can allocate a 16 bpp frame buffer next to 24 bpp bitmaps (used by FMV frames, for instance). This is another feature facilitating further optimisation of space.\n  Whereas the PS1 had a very simple and suitable architecture, problems ended up ari\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-23 19:41:25",

", "note_en": "A French start-up aims to run \u2018hotels on rails\u2019 from Paris to 12 cities across Europe, including Edinburgh, from 2024\n    Less than a decade after  Europe\u2019s night trains appeared to have reached the end of the line, a new French start-up has announced plans for a network of overnight services out of Paris from 2024.\n Midnight Trains is hoping post-Covid interest in cleaner, greener travel will generate interest in its proposed \u201chotels on rails\u201d, which aims to connect the French capital to 12 other European destinations, including Edinburgh.\n  The founders say the aim is not to match the famous \u2013 and expensive \u2013 luxury of the Orient Express but offer an alternative to the basic, state-run SNCF sleepers and short-haul flights.\n Key to the service will be \u201chotel-style\u201d rooms offering privacy and security, and an onboard restaurant and bar.\n Three years ago, Europe\u2019s night trains were being consigned to the economic sidings, driven out of business by low-cost flights and long-distance buses. Since then, however, public concerns over the climate emergency have led to a  surge of interest in reviving night routes across the continent.\n I noted that people around me don\u2019t want to get on a plane because of concerns about carbon emissions&#34;\n Eventually, Midnight Trains plans to serve at least a dozen destinations between 500 and 900 miles from  Paris, including cities in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Denmark and Scotland.\n The final list will be confirmed after agreements have been reached over leasing either new or second-hand rolling stock and the use of rail networks in France and destination countries.\n The company is funded by French entrepreneurs, including the telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel, co-owner of Le Monde newspaper.\n Midnight Trains co-founder Adrien Aumont, also co-founder of the crowdfunding platform KissKissBankBank, says his interest in sleeper trains was kindled by both professional and personal reasons.\n \u201cI noted that people around me don\u2019t want to get on a plane because of concerns about carbon emissions, but also my girlfriend is afraid of flying and decided she was never getting on a plane. I realised the only way travel was going to be possible was by train,\u201d said Aumont.\n  \u201cAt the moment there is no alternative for medium-distance travel [other] than flights or a bad night train. And the only way we can rival planes is to reinvent the train experience.\n \u201cPeople want intimacy,\u201d said Aumont. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be sharing a sleeping space with a stranger. They want privacy, security and a good quality bed. By offering a bar and restaurant we are also offering conviviality and a certain  art de vivre.\n \u201cWhat we aim to do is to make people who want to travel in Europe hesitate to take the plane, to make a 90-minute flight a thing of the past.\u201d\n Aumont was reluctant to give ticket prices, but said these would be competitive with that of a short-haul flight, including what he called the \u201chidden costs\u201d.\n \u201cThis includes what you would have to pay for baggage and things like taxis to and from the airport,\u201d he said.\n Midnight Trains is the latest arrival in what is becoming a crowded market. Across Europe, state-run railways are facing new competition from private operators looking to introduce night trains. Fans of rail travel have waited some time for new night train routes to come along \u2026 only to find, a bit like buses, several turning up at the same time.\n The  Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy, published by the European Commission in December 2020, calls for a major shift in passengers to rail, including night trains.\n Since 2016, Austrian Federal Railways (\u00d6BB) has introduced six  new overnight routes under the Nightjet brand that was already operating nine night routes. Private operators in the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Belgium have announced new overnight services.\n In December last year, \u00d6BB, the German rail company Deutsche Bahn, SNCF and Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) announced the signing of an  agreement to launch new night train services in Europe. This is the first step in developing the  Trans-Europe Express (TEE) 2.0 network, proposed by the German presidency of the Council of the European Union. This partnership plans to launch four new services to 13 of Europe\u2019s largest cities in the coming years.\n In the  International Railway Journal, David Burroughs wrote: \u201cA return to the golden era of night trains in Europe is not going to be easy. But if operators are able to fully develop attractive services to meet the growing demands from passengers, while overcoming the major challenges they face, it could mark the start of a major new era in the post-pandemic world, and offer a major boon for the rail sector.\n Burroughs added: \u201cClimate change will not be solved overnight, but moving from plane to train is widely understood to play an important role in reducing transport emissions, and night trains could contribute to this change.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-23 19:40:30", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5367\u94fa,european,\u94c1\u8def", "title": "\u8ba1\u5212\u65b0\u7684\u6b27\u6d32\u5367\u94fa\u5217\u8f66 ", "title_en": "New network of European sleeper trains planned", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/jun/22/new-network-of-european-sleeper-overnight-trains-planned", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5367\u94fa", "european", "\u94c1\u8def"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "bbf8afce47d60e1fbdc73c33e52de304.jpg", "infoid": 1067671, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Digibarn Xerox\u7ec8\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\uff01 \u8fd9\u662f\u4ece3\u5e74\u524d\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u96c6\u3002 \u6211\u4eec\u7684PCBS\u8d5e\u52a9\u5546\uff1aHTTPS\uff1a//www.pcbway.coms ...

They&#39;re already known to withstand freezing ( even in liquid nitrogen), boiling, desiccation, and  radiation, and the group has persisted for millions of years without having sex. The humble yet remarkably hardy bdelloid rotifer has now surprised researchers yet again\u2014a  recent study unearthed 24,000-year-old Siberian permafrost and found living (or at least revivable) rotifers there. Surviving 24,000 years in deep-freeze is a new record for the species.\n Rotifers aren\u2019t the only living organisms to emerge from permafrost or ice. The same researchers behind this latest discovery had previously found roughly 40,000-year-old  viable roundworms in the region\u2019s permafrost. Ancient moss, seeds, viruses, and bacteria have all shown impressive longevity on ice, prompting  legitimate concern about whether any potentially harmful pathogens may also be released as glaciers and permafrost melt.\n Given that bdelloids are generally only a threat to bacteria, algae, and detritus, however, there\u2019s not much need for concern regarding this particular discovery. But as key players in the bottom of the food chain, newly re-emerged rotifers indicate that maybe we should think about how species that haven\u2019t been seen for millennia might reintegrate into modern ecosystems.\n  The Soil Cryology Lab in Pushchino, Russia, has been digging up Siberian permafrost in search of ancient organisms for roughly a decade. The group estimates the age of the organisms it finds by radiocarbon dating the surrounding soil samples (evidence has shown that there is no vertical movement through layers of permafrost). For example, last year, the researchers reported a \u201c frozen zoo\u201d of 35 viable protists (nucleus-containing organisms that are neither animal, plant, nor fungus), that they calculated ranged from hundreds to tens of thousands of years in age.\n In their most recent discovery, the cryology researchers found the living bdelloids after culturing the soil samples for about one month. Among rotifer classes, bdelloids have the fairly unusual ability to reproduce parthenogenetically\u2014i.e., by cloning\u2014and so the original specimens had already begun to do so. Although the clones made identifying the ancient parent challenging, this did greatly facilitate further investigation of the characteristics and behavior of the unfrozen strain.\n    Throughout all of the above permafrost studies, there is always the concern of sample contamination by modern-day organisms. Besides using techniques designed to prevent this, the team also addressed this issue by looking at the DNA present in the soil samples, confirming that contamination was highly unlikely. Phylogenetic analysis furthermore showed that the species didn\u2019t match any known modern rotifers, although there is a closely related species found in Belgium.\n  The team was naturally interested in better understanding the freezing process and gaining insight into just how these rotifers survived for so long. As a first step, the researchers subsequently froze a selection of the cloned rotifers at -15\u00b0 C for one week and captured videos (see above) of the rotifers reviving.\n The researchers found that not all of the clones survived. Surprisingly, the clones generally weren\u2019t much more freeze-tolerant than contemporary rotifers from Iceland, Alaska, Europe, North America, and even the Asian and African tropics. They were a little more freeze-tolerant than their closest genetic relative, but the difference was marginal.\n The researchers did find that the rotifers could survive a relatively slow freezing process (~45 minutes). This is noteworthy because it was gradual enough that ice crystals formed inside of the animals\u2019 cells\u2014a development that is usually catastrophic for living organisms. In fact, protective mechanisms against this are highly sought-after by anyone in the business of cryo-preservation, making this latest finding especially enticing from that perspective.\n Although the authors aren\u2019t quite in that business, they do plan additional experiments to better understand cryptobiosis\u2014the state of almost completely arrested metabolism that made the rotifers\u2019 survival possible. As for research into cryo-preservation of larger organisms, the authors suggest that this becomes trickier as the organism in question becomes more complex. That said, rotifers are among the most complicated cryo-preserved species so far\u2014complete with organs such as a brain and a gut.\n Which returns us to the questions of what other organisms might reappear with a warming climate and what impacts they might have. Evidence so far shows that multiple types of organisms are still alive in the ice. At least on a microscopic level, it seems possible that intact micro-ecosystems may thaw together (nematodes, rotifers, protists, viruses, bacteria, etc.). How these long-dormant species will compete or coexist with modern ecosystems is difficult to predict at this point, but it\u2019s probably worth further consideration.\n  K.E.D.

", "note_en": "Mitiga, unlike other companies in the  cybersecurity space, isn\u2019t looking to prevent cyberattacks, which the startup claims are inevitable no matter how much protection is in place. Rather, it\u2019s looking to help organizations manage their  incident response, particularly as they transition to hybrid and multi-cloud environments.\n The early-stage startup, which raised $7 million in seed funding in July last year, says its incident readiness and response tech stack accelerates post-incident bounce back from days down to hours. \u00a0Its subscription-based offering automatically detects when a network is breached and quickly investigates, collects case data, and translates it into remediation steps for all relevant divisions within an organization so they can quickly and efficiently respond. Mitiga also documents each event, allowing organizations to fix the cause in order to prevent future attacks.\n  Mitiga\u2019s Series A was led by ClearSky Security, Atlantic Bridge, and DNX, and the startup tells TechCrunch \u00a0that it will use the funds to \u201ccontinue to disrupt how incident readiness and response is delivered,\u201d as well as \u201csignificantly\u201d increasing its cybersecurity, engineering, sales, and marketing staff.\n The company added that the funding comes amid a \u201cchanging mindset\u201d for enterprise organizations when it comes to incident readiness and response. The pandemic has accelerated cloud adoption, and it\u2019s predicted that spending on cloud services will surpass $332 billion this year alone. \u00a0This acceleration, naturally, has provided a lucrative target for hackers, with cyberattacks on cloud services increasing 630% in the first four months of 2020, according to McAfee.\n \u201cThe cloud represents new challenges for incident readiness and response and we\u2019re bringing the industry\u2019s first incident response solution in the cloud, for the cloud,\u201d said Tal Mozes, co-founder and CEO of Mitiga.\n \u201cThis funding will allow us to further our engagements with heads of enterprise security who are looking to recover from an incident in real-time, attract even more of the most innovative cybersecurity minds in the industry, and expand our partner network.

State mandates require that he and other Nome,  Alaska, crabbers travel at least 15 miles from their town\u2019s shore to drop their pots, but as the number of successful crustacean catches dwindled in recent years, they\u2019d often go farther and farther afield.\n Farley could track his distance from home from GPS, but after a long day at sea, it didn\u2019t feel like he was really back until he could see the four ghostly structures atop Anvil Mountain. \u201cOn a clear day you can see them at least five or six miles out,\u201d Farley says. \u201cThey were always there, part of Nome.\u201d\n Colloquially, they\u2019re known as \u201cNomehenge\u201d or simply \u201cthe billboards,\u201d though, given their concave shape, one could easily mistake them for unfinished skate ramps. Sitting on the summit of the otherwise-bald 1,200-foot mountain that looms behind the town, they\u2019re useful wayfinding aids for aircraft pilots, boat captains, hikers, and snowmobilers\u2014particularly in the winter, when it\u2019s dark much of the day and the snow is deep enough to obscure most other landmarks.\n However, during the Cold War, the structures were antennas, conceived to serve as an important early warning system for Soviet attack. Then, the array and its now-extinct peers were known as the White Alice Communications System.\n  At the beginning of the Cold War, development of the Arctic was one of the primary objectives of the U.S. Air Force. At the time, Alaska had inadequate infrastructure to support those missions, with insufficient roads, ports, and railroads and the bulk of military bases located in areas meant to meet a southern rival, not one coming over the  North Pole. Still, the biggest challenge was communication. If residents wanted to make a long-distance call, they needed to make a reservation to use the only circuit in town. Getting news across or outside of Alaska wasn\u2019t an easy process, and was astronomically expensive. The White Alice Communications System changed that. It made it easier for locals to stay connected, and allowed the Air Force to warn the mainland of any incoming Russian bombers.\n When the four towers in Nome accepted their first transmission in January 1958, the tropospheric antennas (a type of technology that sends and receives signals by bouncing them off layers in the atmosphere) were ahead of their time. The Nome site was a part of a larger system of 71 sites that operated by receiving radio waves from 200 miles away and hot-potatoing the message down the line to the next site. A single site required the work of dozens or hundreds of people, and called for near-constant tinkering. Most sites were supplemented with dorms, cafeterias, guard posts, and other amenities. Many sit on the coast, as close as possible to the adversary that the country was trying to watch. The strategic value of their presence  helped bolster Alaska\u2019s bid for statehood in 1959.\n But following the advancements made in satellite communications in the 1970s, White Alice quickly became obsolete. In the years that have followed, all but the Nome antennas were torn down. Many of the sites had become targets for vandalism and were contaminated with petroleum, lead, and asbestos (all of which were used in the construction and maintenance of the sites). The Nome site alone saw more than 8 million pounds of contaminated soil shipped from the mountaintop to Arlington,  Oregon, for treatment. \u201cGenerally if there\u2019s a potential liability, whoever owns it is going to want to limit that,\u201d says Bill O\u2019Connell, who worked as an environmental consultant doing clean-up for the White Alice sites in the early 2000s. \u201cNome had to lobby pretty hard to get the structures retained.\u201d\n  While the towers, the most recognizable element of the White Alice system, have vanished elsewhere in Alaska, there are some support facilities\u2014largely the original control rooms\u2014quietly standing in the vast landscape. Though these no longer use radio waves, they still serve the purpose of keeping Alaska connected. Now, they hold the networks that make up the internet, phone systems, cellular, and more, allowing roadless villages to connect (digitally, at least) to the rest of the world. The bulk of the sites are now owned by the telecommunications company AT&amp;T, which is tasked with running the next-generation systems.\n While the White Alice system needed teams of workers monitoring it around the clock, today one person can do the job alone. \u201cOur remote [former White Alice] sites can run for an entire year without a visit,\u201d says Casey Anderson, an Outlying Area Technician for Core Network Operations with the telecommunications company. \u201cMany times that\u2019s all I do: an annual check-up. Check that everything is fine, turn off the lights, lock the door, fly to the next one.\u201d\n In the years post-White Alice, much of the original equipment in the support buildings was replaced by its modern equivalent and some of the buildings have been spruced up, but still, they\u2019re \u201ca little spooky,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cBecause they were built to withstand a nuclear blast, the aesthetics of the buildings weren\u2019t particularly important,\u201d Anderson adds. \u201cThey\u2019re largely nondescript buildings, in the middle of nowhere, with no windows.\u201d\n  Because the White Alice sites are the ancestors to the modern communications that make up the bulk of his job, Anderson looks forward to visiting them\u2014he even has a map of Alaska in his home where he\u2019s circled the sites he\u2019s been to. In 2016, Nome recognized that others might be similarly interested in the communications antennae and fought to not only save them but also make them  a tourism spot.\n In 2012, the land the Anvil Mountain White Alice site sits on was supposed to be given to the Sitnasuak Native Corp, a for-profit company that voted to have the structure dismantled so they  wouldn\u2019t be on the hook for any liability. To keep the antennas, the Nome City Council offered to trade Sitnasuak for a significantly more valuable plot of land in town. Sitnasuak accepted and the antennas stayed.\n \u201cI think people like the history behind it\u2014it makes them feel like Nome matters to the outside world,\u201d says longtime Nome resident Russell Rowe, adding that often Nomehenge appears on local T-shirts, like an unofficial mascot. \u201cWhen it was brought up that it might go away, there were a lot of people that were opposed to it.\u201d\n For now, the city seems content to leave the site as is, allowing locals to use the surrounding area for recreation. Rowe brings his young sons up to the summit a dozen or so times a year to geocache, pick blueberries, and bike along the trails in the shadow of the 120-foot antennas. There are often other locals up there, hiking with their dogs, picnicking, or gathering the ultra-soft, incredibly warm fibers shed by musk oxen, which make great yarn. Occasionally, busloads of tourists will attempt to traverse the bumpy road to get closer to the site.\n \u201cThere are 360-degree views of the landscape around Nome from the White Alice site\u2014all the rolling tundra hills, the bigger peaks to the north, and then out to the ocean,\u201d Rowe says. \u201cIt might sound strange, but it\u2019s a nice place to be.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-23

", "note_en": "I spoke to Golden Ventures Founder and Managing Partner Matt Golden, and General Partner Ameet Shah about its plans for this fund, and about the Canadian startup and investment landscape in general.\n \u201cOver time, we\u2019re certainly seeing more and more interest in institutional LPs, more and more interest in the Canadian ecosystem, which I think is a net positive,\u201d Golden said. \u201cWhereas before, the Canadian ecosystem was largely funded by Canadian institutions, so I think that\u2019s really positive, because you have to sort of be judged on the on the world stage. And we\u2019re starting to meet that bar as both an ecosystem and as a fund.\u201d\n  Golden said that the game plan with this Fund IV doesn\u2019t really change in terms of their investment targets; while Golden initially set out to invest primarily in companies working on software products for mobile devices, it eventually shifted to a strategy of backing North American seed stage, mission-driven founders working on venture-scale opportunities across a range of verticals and categories.\n \u201cI would say that over time, our ratio of deals, Canada to U.S., we\u2019ve increased the number of deals on a ratio basis that we do in Canada versus the U.S., just by virtue of the fact that the Canadian ecosystem is on a terrific, high-velocity trajectory.\u201d Golden said. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen it coming, but I think it\u2019s really starting to hit its stride now, with lots of founders with \u2018big swing\u2019 vision, and an increasing interest in capital playing in the ecosystem.\u201d\n Shah added that he also thinks we\u2019re trending towards more startups that originate in Canada setting up nodes in different geographies in ways that make most sense for their talent needs, and vice versa.\n \u201cPost-COVID, a lot of companies may start here, but with the geographical boundaries just blurring, there\u2019s really no reason they can\u2019t set up locations in different centers of gravity and take advantage of other ecosystems\u2019 competitive advantages,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had one that recently set up a location in LA, as well as Toronto, capturing some the value of LA but also leveraging all the talent in Toronto as well. I think you\u2019re gonna start seeing more and more of that, where things are moving more towards networks, and not just cities in general.\u201d\n As for this fund raise, it\u2019s one of three recent Canadian early stage pools of venture capital to also include an \u2018Opportunities Fund,\u2019 which in each case has been described as a way for the firms to participate in later stage deals in their star portfolio companies that they wouldn\u2019t otherwise be set up to invest in as an early stage investment organization. Golden Ventures is also introducing another new type of investment to its roster with Fund IV, however.\n \u201cThere\u2019s this concept, we call it \u2018Angel allocation,\u2019 [\u2026] it\u2019s the idea that we can invest smaller checks, sort of 400-to-500 thousand, into companies where maybe the structure of the opportunity or of the deal may not fit what our core checks would be,\u201d Golden explains. \u201cThat could be, for example, a case where there\u2019s not enough room left in the round, or the valuation is outside of our core range, or maybe we\u2019re learning about a completely new space that\u2019s highly experimental \u2014 but we still have a high degree of conviction in the opportunity, in the people behind that opportunity, and the returns that it could generate.\u201d\n Funds for those investments will come out of the main Fund IV pool, but the majority will still be targeting those core 20-25 larger checks. Overall, though, both Golden and Shah emphasize that the primary goal of the fund at this stage is capitalizing on the growing trend they see of more opportunity emerging in the Canadian ecosystem, and the impact that\u2019s having in terms of startups across North America.\n \u201cWhen you talk about who are the the top five to ten companies in Canada, for a long time, it was really the same group,\u201d Shah said. \u201cNow, you\u2019ve got this new crop of people that have come in and feel like they\u2019re still on an upward trajectory, and I think that\u2019s just really exciting as well.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-23 18:18:32", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "ventures,\u52a0\u62ff\u5927", "title": "Golden Ventures\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e861000\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u7b2c\u56db\u57fa\u91d1\u548c20\u7c73\u673a\u4f1a\u57fa\u91d1 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tGolden Ventures raises $100M fourth fund and $20M opportunities fund\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/golden-ventures-raises-100m-fourth-fund-and-20m-opportunities-fund/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["ventures", "\u52a0\u62ff\u5927"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f5504d773d0ef473842f30e094550684.jpg", "infoid": 1067664, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u53cd\u5bf9\u610f\u89c1\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u5b57\u5e7f\u544a\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u6d4f\u89c8\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u670d\u52a1\u65f6\u64c5\u957f\u6709\u5173\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u521b\u5efa\u7528\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u8981\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u50cf\u9ad8\u901f\u62cd\u5356\u4e00\u6837\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u79f0\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ade\u6807\uff09\u3002\n \u6b27\u76df\u7684\u94c5\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u76d1\u7763\u5458\u4ee5\u524d\u547c\u5401\u7981\u6b62\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u666e\u904d\u7684\u8ffd\u8e2a -

So pressure is growing on lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic to tackle exploitative adtech as consensus builds over the damage associated with mass surveillance-based manipulation.\n At the same time,  momentum is clearly building for  pro-privacy  consumer tech and  services \u2014 showing the rising store being placed by users and innovators on business models that respect people\u2019s data.\n The growing uptake of such services underlines how alternative, rights-respecting digital business models are not only possible (and accessible, with many freemium offerings) but increasingly popular.\n  In an  open letter addressing EU and US policymakers, the international coalition \u2014 which is comprised of 55 organizations and more than 20 experts including groups like Privacy International, the Open Rights Group, the Center for Digital Democracy, the New Economics Foundation, Beuc, Edri and Fairplay \u2014 urges legislative action, calling for a ban on ads that rely on \u201csystematic commercial surveillance\u201d of Internet users in order to serve what Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg likes, euphemistically, to refer to as \u2018relevant ads\u2019.\n The problem with Zuckerberg\u2019s (self-serving) framing is that, as the coalition points out, the vast majority of consumers don\u2019t actually want to be spied upon to be served with these creepy ads.\n Any claimed \u2018relevance\u2019 is irrelevant to consumers who experience ad-stalking as creepy and unpleasant. (And just imagine how the average Internet user would feel if they could peek behind the adtech curtain \u2014 and see the vast databases where people are profiled at scale so their attention can be sliced and diced for commercial interests and sold to the highest bidder).\n The coalition points to a  report examining consumer attitudes to surveillance-based advertising, prepared by one of the letter\u2019s signatories (the Norwegian Consumer Council; NCC), which found that only one in ten people are positive about commercial actors collecting information about them online \u2014 and only one in five think ads based on personal information are okay.\n 1/4 \ud83d\ude45\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f80-90% of people online don&#39;t want to be spied on for &#39;more relevant ads,&#39; finds  @Forbrukerradet&#39;s report.\ud83d\ude45\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n Neither do we at  @edri, which is why we join over 50 orgs &amp; 20 academics &amp; experts for a transatlantic call to  #BanSurveillanceAdvertising. https://t.co/bTCdZIsSuP  pic.twitter.com/3rtDjAMIxA\n A full third of respondents to the survey were \u201cvery negative\u201d about microtargeted ads \u2014 while almost half think advertisers should not be able to target ads based on any form of personal information.\n The report also highlights a sense of impotence among consumers when they go online, with six out of ten respondents feeling that they have no choice but to give up information about themselves.\n That finding should be particularly concerning for EU policymakers as the bloc\u2019s data protection framework is supposed to provide citizens with a suite of rights related to their personal data that should protect them against being strong-armed to hand over info \u2014 including stipulating that if a data controller intends to rely on user consent to process data then consent must be informed, specific and freely given; it can\u2019t be stolen, strong-armed or sneaked through using dark patterns. (Although that remains  all too often the case.)\n  Forced consent is not legal under EU law \u2014 yet, per the NCC\u2019s European survey, a majority of respondents feel they have no choice but to be creeped on when they use the Internet.\n That in turn points to an ongoing EU enforcement failure over major adtech-related complaints, scores of which have been filed in recent years under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) \u2014  some of which are now over three years old (yet still haven\u2019t resulted in any action against rule-breakers).\n Over the past couple of years  EU lawmakers have acknowledged problems with patchy GDPR enforcement \u2014 and it\u2019s interesting to note that the Commission suggested some alternative enforcement structures in its  recent digital regulation proposals, such as for oversight of very large online platforms in the  Digital Services Act (DSA).\n In the letter, the coalition suggests the DSA as the ideal legislative vehicle to contain a ban on surveillance-based ads.\n Negotiations to shape a final proposal which EU institutions will need to vote on remain ongoing \u2014 but it\u2019s possible the EU parliament could pick up the baton to push for a ban on surveillance ads. It has the power to amend the Commission\u2019s legislative proposals and its approval is needed for draft laws to be adopted. So there\u2019s plenty still to play for.\n \u201cIn the US, we urge legislators to enact comprehensive privacy legislation,\u201d the coalition adds.\n  The coalition is backing up its call for a ban on surveillance-based advertising with another  report (also by the NCC) which lays out the case against microtargeting \u2014 summarizing the raft of concerns that have come to be  attached to manipulative ads as awareness of the adtech industry\u2019s vast, background people-profiling and data trading has grown.\n Listed concerns not only focus on how privacy-stripping practices are horrible for individual consumers (enabling the manipulation, discrimination and exploitation of individuals and vulnerable groups) but also flag the damage to digital competition as a result of adtech platforms and data brokers intermediating and cannibalizing publishers\u2019 revenues \u2014 eroding, for example, the ability of professional journalism to sustain itself and creating the conditions where ad fraud has been able to flourish.\n Another contention is that the overall health of democratic societies is put at risk by surveillance-based advertising \u2014 as the apparatus and incentives fuel the amplification of misinformation and create security risks, and even national security risks. (Strong and independent journalism is also, of course, a core plank of a healthy democracy.)\n \u201cThis harms consumers and businesses, and can undermine the cornerstones of democracy,\u201d the coalition warns.\n \u201cAlthough we recognize that advertising is an important source of revenue for content creators and publishers online, this does not justify the massive commercial surveillance systems set up in attempts to \u2018show the right ad to the right people\u2019,\u201d the letter goes on. \u201cOther forms of advertising technologies exist, which do not depend on spying on consumers, and cases have shown that such alternative models can be implemented without significantly affecting revenue.\n \u201cThere is no fair trade-off in the current surveillance-based advertising system. We encourage you to take a stand and consider a ban of surveillance-based advertising as part of the Digital Services Act in the EU, and the for U.S. to enact a long overdue federal privacy law.\u201d\n  The letter is just the latest salvo against \u2018toxic adtech\u2019. And advertising giants like Facebook and Google have \u2014 for several years now \u2014 seen the pro-privacy writing on the wall.\n Hence Facebook\u2019s claimed \u2018 pivot to privacy\u2018; its plan to lock in its first party data advantage (by  merging the infrastructure of different messaging products); and its  keen interest in crypto.\n It\u2019s also why Google has been working on a stack of alternative adtech that it wants to replace third party tracking cookies. Although its proposed replacement \u2014 the so-called \u2018 Privacy Sandbox\u2018 \u2014 would still enable groups of Internet users to be opaquely clustered by its algorithms in \u2018interest\u2019 buckets for ad targeting purposes which still  doesn\u2019t look great for Internet users\u2019 rights either. (And  concerns have been raised on the competition front too.)\n Where its \u2018Sandbox\u2019 proposal is concerned, Google may well be factoring in the possibility of legislation that outlaws \u2014 or, at least, more tightly controls \u2014 microtargeting. And it\u2019s therefore trying to race ahead with developing alternative adtech that would have much the same targeting potency (maintaining its market power) but, by swapping out individuals for cohorts of web users, could potentially sidestep a ban on \u2018microtargeting\u2019 technicalities.\n Legislators addressing this issue will therefore need to be smart in how they draft any laws intended to tackle the damage caused by surveillance-based advertising.\n Certainly they will if they want to prevent the same old small- and large-scale manipulation abuses from being perpetuated.\n The NCC\u2019s report points to what it dubs as \u201cgood alternatives\u201d for digital advertising models which don\u2019t depend on the systematic surveillance of consumers to function. And which \u2014 it also argues \u2014 provide advertisers and publishers with \u201cmore oversight and control over where ads are displayed and which ads are being shown\u201d.\n The problem of ad fraud is certainly massively underreported. But, well, it\u2019s instructive to recall how often Facebook has had to  \u2018fess up to problems with self reported ad metrics\u2026\n \u201cIt is possible to sell advertising space without basing it on intimate details about consumers. Solutions already exist to show ads in relevant contexts, or where consumers self-report what ads they want to see,\u201d the NCC\u2019s director of digital\u202fpolicy, Finn\u202fMyrstad, noted in a statement.\n \u201cA ban on surveillance-based advertising would also pave the way for a more transparent advertising marketplace, diminishing the need to share large parts of ad revenue with third parties such as data brokers. A level playing field would contribute to giving advertisers and content providers more control, and keep a larger share of the revenue.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-23 18:18:05", "source_domain":

", "note_en": "We\u2019ve been self-hosting Grafana and an InfluxDB database for a long time, using it for monitoring our custom application metrics. However, we started to push our patience with maintenance and the limits of performance on a $5/mo DigitalOcean droplet.\n In an effort to simplify things we started exploring what hosted solutions are available. Really, we just want something simple and cheap. The two main options we considered were InfluxDB Cloud and Grafana Cloud, both offering fairly generous free-tiers.\n     We started with InfluxDB Cloud, mainly because we were already using InfluxDB as our data store. Thus, we didn\u2019t have to rewrite any of our code that pushes metrics. Overall our first impressions were good, onboarding was simple and the UI looked nice. We were quickly able to get our data into InfluxDB Cloud as well, and could start setting up our panels and alerts. This is where we started to run into issues.\n    Coming from Grafana, we were used to a certain degree of customization. InfluxDB Cloud however offers very limited customization. For example, there are only 3 options available for Y-axis units and legend options are very limited.\n  Visually one of the most frustrating things was that the graph series colors kept changing  every time you refresh the data, making it very difficult to keep track of what you\u2019re looking at.\n  Another very frustrating feature (or lack thereof) is that the hover tooltip does not give any indication of the specific series your mouse cursor is currently hovering over. A simple solution here would be to make the actively hovered series hold or emphazied.\n     While we  could live with the visualization and customization issues, alerts was were we completely gave up on InfluxDB Cloud. No matter how much we tried, we just weren\u2019t able to get a simple basic alert to work.\n The process of setting up alerts was not very intuitive. For example, the \u201cChecks\u201d UI let\u2019s you setup your desired thresholds. The graph includes options to toggle the threshold markers. Yet these don\u2019t actually do anything at all, and the inputted thresholds aren\u2019t shown in the UI. This is where I got stuck first, thinking my thresholds weren\u2019t set, when in fact they were.\n  It\u2019s also easy to accidentally introduce \u201cgaps\u201d in your threshold levels. At first you may think to setup an alert like this (OK below 10 and WARN above 10). Well, then you\u2019re missing the value of 10 (which becomes an \u201cunknown\u201d state).\n  So in this case you should setup something like this instead (WARN above 9 and OK below 10), which is  correct but just feels wrong. I\u2019m sure they could have come up with a better solution for this.\n  However, after adding a \u201cCheck\u201d and setting up my \u201cNotification Endpoint\u201d I still wasn\u2019t getting any alerts. After some time I realized there was another UI I had missed, namely \u201cNotification Rules\u201d.\n  I got quite excited at this point, since there seemed to be a lot of flexibility. I started by testing setting up an alert that would remind us every 24 hours if an alert was still critical. While this did in fact  work, it also resulted in our Slack getting completely spammed with 100+ notifications. I\u2019m not sure why\u2026 but we quickly removed this alert.\n  After this I tried setting up a simple alert for when the status changes from OK to CRIT. This however, just didn\u2019t work. No alerts were sent. At this point we gave up, after having spent more than 1 week trying to get things to work.\n One thing to keep in mind is that InfluxDB Cloud\u2019s free tier only includes 2 alerts (so we would have definitely needed to upgrade to the paid tier if we had decided to stay with InfluxDB Cloud).\n Another bug we ran into was that at one point a team member tried resetting their password, which instead created a brand new organization and was no longer able to re-join the original organization without creating a new account using a new email address\u2026\n     Even though we were previously using Grafana for visualizations we were a little hesitant to try Grafana Cloud. The main reason was that we would need to switch from InfluxDB for our storage to either Graphite or Prometheus, which are offered on Grafana Cloud.\n Since we are primarily monitoring basic application metrics we ideally just wanted a simple endpoint that we could push our data to (no need for fancy buffering, redundancy or error checking). Also, since our application is running in a PaaS we didn\u2019t want to have to install any extra local dependencies in order to push data to Grafana. Initially I thought it was a requirement to have a local agent running, but we did eventually figure out how to push metrics to Grafana using the Graphite HTTP API.\n    It was a little tricky to find, but it is possible to push data directly to Grafana Cloud using the Graphite HTTP API. The documentation can be found  here. If the link doesn\u2019t work, try Googling for it since their docs links seem to change and break quite often.\n They also provide a small example  GitHub repo, which I used as a starting point.\n  const  API_KEY  =  &#39; &lt;orgId&gt;:&lt;token&gt; &#39; ; const  ENDPOINT  =  &#39; https://graphite-us-central1.grafana.net/metrics &#39; ; // get current unix timestamp const  time  =  Math . floor ( Date . now ()  /  1000 ); // we&#39;re reporting values every 10 seconds const  interval  =  10 ; const  data  =  {  time :  Math . floor ( time  /  interval )  *  interval ,  // align timestamp to interval  name :  &#39; app.some_metric.some_field &#39; ,  interval :  interval ,  value :  1.234 ,  tags :  [ &#39; type=foo &#39; ,  &#39; kind=bar &#39; ], }; const  headers  =  {  Authorization :  `Bearer  ${ API_KEY } `  }; got . post ( ENDPOINT ,  {  headers ,  responseType :  &#39; json &#39; ,  resolveBodyOnly :  true ,  json :  data , });\n One important thing to remember with Graphite is that metrics have to be aligned to the given interval. For example, an interval of 10 means that there will be one value for the given series every 10 seconds. It is best to make sure you push your metrics slightly more frequently then the interval to make sure you don\u2019t miss any time slots, which would result in gaps (null values) in your data.\n    Since we\u2019ve only been using InfluxDB as a data source in Grafana previously, there was a bit of a learning curve with Graphite. In particular, I was having a hard time figuring out how to use tags. However, once you understand the syntax it\u2019s fairly easy to use.\n   However, for series with tags, you first to have select  Tag: name in order to choose your metric (I didn\u2019t realize graphite automatically created the \u201cname\u201d tag, so I was confused about this at first).\n    After that, you can add additional tags to filter the data by tag value, and you can also add functions such as  aliasByTags to name each series by their tag value (resulting in better looking legends).\n     Another bonus feature we discovered is the Synthethic Monitoring feature, also available in the free tier. It provides some basic application monitoring, with downtime monitoring and global latency checks. Nice to have!\n     Overall both options have very generous free tiers, great for anyone looking to get started with basic monitoring. The biggest drawback with InfluxDB Cloud is that they only offer 2 alerts on the free-tier, which feels very low in my opinion.\n            The biggest difference between the two is clearly the maturity and rich feature-set offered by Grafana, whereas the solution InfluxDB Cloud offers feels lacking and buggy. We\u2019ll stick with Grafana Cloud for now!", "posttime": "2021-06-23 18:10:10", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u76d1\u63a7,monitoring,\u6d8c\u5165", "title": "\u6258\u7ba1\u76d1\u63a7\uff1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d8c\u5165\u4e91\u548cGrafana\u4e91 ", "title_en": "Hosted Monitoring: Evaluating InfluxDB Cloud and Grafana Cloud", "transed": 1, "url": "https://pqvst.com/2021/06/22/hosted-monitoring-evaluating-influx-and-grafana/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u76d1\u63a7", "\u6d8c\u5165"]}]
