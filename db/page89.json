Chopped and processed fruits are exempt from the ban.\n There are a lot of things wrong with our (over)use of plastic.\u00a0 Pollution from discarded plastic is a major concern.\u00a0 As we all know, both large pieces of plastic and microplastic particles can have nasty environmental effects.\u00a0 The other big problem with plastic is that it is mostly made from fossil fuels; carbon-rich materials that we should be leaving in the ground.\n  There\u2019s a reason we started using plastic to pack food last century: it is very good at protecting food during transport, storage and display. It protects food from spoilage, from damage and from contamination.\u00a0 Plastic packaging makes it easier for manufacturers, retailers and consumers to transport, store and display and buy food. Compared to non-plastic alternatives, plastic packaging is lighter, cheaper, more impact-resistant and \u2013 in some cases \u2013 more appealing to consumers.\n Products like mass-produced bread rely on plastic packaging to retain moisture so they stay fresher for longer.\u00a0 Without plastic, many staple foods like mass-produced bread, which feeds millions of people every day, would be much more difficult to transport and display in our stores. \u00a0And they would suffer from much shorter shelf lives as well.\n I have three big reasons for loving plastic.\u00a0 My number one reason is its ability to keep food fresher for longer, which reduces food waste.\n Secondly, plastic is also effective at retaining nutrients in food.\u00a0 Compared to other packaging materials like glass and metal cans, plastic packaging needs less energy to make and transport, but can be equally effective at retaining nutrients. Frozen vegetables: I\u2019m looking at you.\n My third reason for loving plastic is a little controversial. This sounds crazy, but it\u2019s got to do with the global greenhouse effect. Plastic is an excellent store for carbon.\u00a0 The very same attribute that makes plastic such a long-lived pollutant makes it an effective means of keeping carbon out of the atmosphere. Plastic is mostly carbon, and it (mostly) doesn\u2019t biodegrade, which means it isn\u2019t converted back into carbon dioxide when it becomes waste.\n Subscribe for free to The Rotten Apple for more like this (we don\u2019t use your email address for anything else, ever)\n  Plastic is made almost exclusively from fossil fuels, either from crude oil or natural gas.\u00a0 More specifically, the building blocks of plastics are produced from the naphtha fraction when crude oil is refined, or from the ethane and propane components of natural gas.\n As a result, when we make plastic, we are using carbon from fossil fuels, carbon that \u2013 from a greenhouse effect perspective \u2013 should have been left underground.\n Of course, humans don\u2019t extract fossil fuels just to make plastic.\u00a0 The part of fossil fuels used for olefin plastics \u2013 which are by far the most common type of plastic - are different to the components (\u201cfractions\u201d) we use for other purposes, such as diesel fuel, town gas, heating oil and bitumen. \u00a0So, for as long as we are extracting fossil carbon for those purposes, we have access to a cheap and easy supply of components for plastics.\n Much of the fossil carbon we extract from the ground gets released into the atmosphere when we burn it for fuel; think gasoline, aviation fuel, heating oil and cooking gas.\u00a0 If we are going to extract oil and gas, we may as well turn some of it into stuff that doesn\u2019t get burnt, like plastic.\n Not all plastic ends up in our oceans.\u00a0 While single use plastics create litter and pollution, we also make plastic items that can last a lifetime. Plastic is used in building construction, pipes, cars (16% of an average European car is plastic, by one estimate), carpets and clothing.\u00a0 The longer a piece of plastic remains intact, unburnt, and not bio-degraded, the longer the carbon it contains is locked up and not contributing to the greenhouse effect. In these forms, it is an excellent, stable store of carbon.\n An even better way to store carbon in plastic is to use atmospheric carbon dioxide to manufacture it.\u00a0 We already have the technology to create plastic from atmospheric carbon dioxide. This can be done using biological processes like plants or algae, where photosynthesis is used to extract the carbon dioxide from the air, or by using synthetic processes powered by renewable electricity.\n Right now, these methods are not economically feasible, but that will change when demand for fossil fuels decreases.\u00a0 Less than ten percent of global oil production is used for making plastic, so we should expect higher prices for the plastic-producing fractions of crude oil as oil extraction diminishes. The changing economics of fossil fuel production is going to have a significant impact on the traditional plastic industry.\n Plastic is a major pollutant, but it\u2019s also an overlooked carbon storage solution. We need to capture food packaging plastics before they pollute our oceans or break-down into microplastics.\u00a0 We can capture and bury them in properly designed landfill (not ideal but better than most other options) or recycle them into new items.\u00a0 It\u2019s my fervent hope that in the future virgin plastics will be made using renewable-energy-powered carbon-capture processes.\n  In short: \ud83c\udf4f Plastic makes a great carbon store and helps keep fossil carbon from ending up in our atmosphere: crazy but true! \ud83c\udf4f Also, France banned single use plastic packaging for fruit and veg \ud83c\udf4f\n Subscribe for free to The Rotten Apple for more like this (I don\u2019t use your email address for anything else, ever)\n Subscribe for free to The Rotten Apple for more like this (we don\u2019t use your email address for anything else, ever)", "posttime": "2022-01-11 12:57:33", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5851\u6599,plastic", "title": "\u8d5e\u7f8e\u5851\u6599\uff08\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5851\u6599\u9002\u5408\u73af\u5883\uff09", "title_en": "In Praise of Plastic (Why Plastic Is Good for the Environment)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://therottenapple.substack.com/p/in-praise-of-plastic", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5851\u6599", "plastic"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "0897194e1c3ff9d617dc9092c39013cd.jpg", "infoid": 1072725, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6d77\u8c5a\u6709\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7684\u6027\u751f\u6d3b\uff0c\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u8fbe\u62c9\u65af\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u590d\u5236\u3002\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u56e0\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7a81\u51fa\u7684\u5973\u6027\u6d77\u8c5a\u9634\u8482\u63d0\u4f9b\u6027\u6109\u60a6\u3002\n\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u6d77\u8c5a\u5728\u5357\u8377\u5170\u7701\u5357\u8377\u5170\u7701\u9ea6\u5229\u5965\u65af\u5b66\u9662\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5bb6\u5e15\u7279\u91cc\u897f\u4e9a\u5e03\u4f26\u5357\uff0c\u74f6\u9888\u6d77\u8c5a\u9634\u8482\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u6d77\u8c5a\u9634\u8482\u53ef\u5728\u6027\u4ea4\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e50\u8da3\u3002\n\u50cf\u5973\u6027\u751f\u6b96\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u9634\u8482 - \u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u7269\u79cd\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ea\u662f\u6d77\u8c5a - \u4e0e\u96c4\u6027\u751f\u6b96\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u57281998\u5e74\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u9634\u8482\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e25\u683c\u7814\u7a76\u5c1a\u672a\u516c\u5e03\u3002\n\u4ece\u6d77\u8c5a\u6807\u672c\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u6b7b\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u539f\u56e0\u7684\u6d77\u8c5a\u6807\u672c\uff0cBrennan\u7684\u56e2\u961f\u53d1\u73b0\u6d77\u8c5a\u9634\u830e\u4f53\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u8868\u9762\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u5927\u795e\u7ecf\u4f9b\u5e94\u3002 \u201c\u6240\u4ee5\u5c31\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u201d\u5979\u8bf4\uff0c\u201c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u662f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002\u201d\n\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u5e74\u8f7b\u548c\u6210\u4eba\u6d77\u8c5a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9634\u8482\u5f62\u72b6\u4e5f\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u5c11\u5e74\u5973\u6027\u5177\u6709C\u5f62\u9634\u8482\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u751f\u6b96\u6210\u719f\u7684\u5973\u6027\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u4e14S\u5f62\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f2f\u66f2\u5f62\u72b6Brennan\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u653e\u677e\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6536\u5165\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u3002 \u201c\u5f53\u90a3\u4e2a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7528\u8840\u6db2\u586b\u6ee1\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u76f4\u5347\uff0c\u201d\u5979\u89e3\u91ca\u8bf4\u3002\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u5973\u6027\u6d77\u8c5a\u4e2d\uff0c\u81f3\u5c11\u6709\u53e6\u5916\u4e24\u4e2a\u5176\u4ed6\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u7528\u4e8e\u5973\u6027\u6d77\u8c5a\u4e2d\u7684\u6269\u5927\u9634\u8482\u3002\u4f9b\u5e94\u9634\u8482\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u4e1b\u96c6\u53ef\u80fd\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u96c4\u6027\u9634\u830e\u7684\u5171\u540c\u7684\u80da\u80ce\u6839\u3002\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u672f\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u6765\u81ea\u76f8\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u9634\u830e\u4e5f\u826f\u597d\u5730\u4f9b\u5e94\u795e\u7ecf\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9634\u8482\u4e5f\u4e0d\u592a\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6\u3002\n\u5728\u751f\u6b96\u751f\u7269\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u7269\u79cd\u4e2d\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u5173\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u4ecd\u7136\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u7684\u5973\u6027\u6027\u6b32\u3002 \u201c\u6d77\u8c5a\u201d\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\u4eec\u81ea\u5df1\uff0c\u201c\u5e03\u4f26\u5357\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u4eec\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u4e1c\u897f\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u5927\u81ea\u7136\u4e2d\u5b66\u5230\u3002\u201d\np.l.r.

One reason may be that the prominent female dolphin clitoris provides sexual pleasure.\n A new up-close look at clitoral tissue from common bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops truncatus) reveals  many similarities to the human clitoris. Abundant sensory nerves and spongy tissues in the genitalia of our female flippered friends suggest the dolphin clitoris may be highly sensitive to physical contact, researchers report January 10 in  Current Biology.\n The findings suggest that the bottlenose dolphin clitoris likely provides pleasure during sex, which adds up since dolphins have sex all the time, says Patricia Brennan, an evolutionary biologist at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass.\n Heterosexual and homosexual sex is common in wild dolphins, including female-female sex. \u201cWhat that looks like is females stimulating each other\u2019s clitoris,\u201d with snouts, flippers or flukes, Brennan says. Females also masturbate by rubbing their clitoris against objects on the sea bottom.\n  Like female reproductive anatomy generally, the clitoris \u2014 in many species, not just dolphins \u00a0\u2014 is poorly studied in contrast to male genitalia. The  first rigorous study of clitoral anatomy in humans wasn\u2019t published until 1998.\n During Brennan\u2019s  recent research on dolphin vaginal anatomy, the large size of the common bottlenose dolphin clitoris aroused her curiosity ( SN: 12/15/17). The paucity of prior research prompted Brennan and colleagues to examine the organ and look under the hood \u2014 including under the wrinkled clitoral hood \u2014 an area of enlarged erectile tissue near the vaginal entrance where contact and penile stimulation during copulation is likely.\n Excising the clitorises from dolphin specimens that died of natural causes, Brennan\u2019s team found that the dolphin clitoral body is supplied by abundant large nerves at the skin surface. \u201cSo just like humans,\u201d she says, \u201cthese are areas of high sensitivity.\u201d\n CT scans and dissection also revealed many structural features similar to the human clitoris, though differing in shape and with more spongy tissues. Like in humans, the dolphin clitoris has erectile bodies with dense layers of connective tissue, comprised of collagen and elastin fiber that maintains structural integrity under pressure. The team also found genital corpuscles, encapsulated sensory nerve endings called \u201ccorpuscles of pleasure\u201d in humans.\n Clitoral shape also differs between young and adult dolphins, the researchers report. Juvenile females have a C-shaped clitoris, whereas it is larger and S-shaped in reproductively mature females. These bendy shapes, Brennan predicts, represent a relaxed rather than engorged state. \u201cWhen that tissue fills up with blood, it\u2019s going to straighten up,\u201d she explains.\n These new findings are \u201cstriking but not surprising,\u201d notes Teri Orr, a physiological ecologist at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces who was not involved in this study. Orr, a former postdoc of Brennan, studies genitalia across species. Like bonobos and chimps, she says, dolphin group dynamics involve bonding and pleasure-seeking through sex.\n However, there are at least two other potential hypotheses for the evolution of an enlarged clitoris in female dolphins, Orr says. The thicket of nerves supplying the clitoris may reflect its shared embryological root with the penis in males. During development both arise from the same types of tissues, and the penis is also well-supplied with nerves, so it\u2019s not too surprising that the clitoris is as well.\n Additionally, although modern dolphins do not have ovulation that is induced by an external stimulus, in dolphin ancestors, clitoral stimulation could have played a role in stimulating ovulation, Orr speculates. Across species, theories abound about why female clitoral stimulation can lead to orgasm, and perhaps pleasure and fertility coevolved.\n With a historical and persistent gender bias in reproductive biology research, there is much about female sexuality in all species that we still don\u2019t know.

Car owners get the chance to offset ownership costs, and users get the benefit of affordable short-term rentals at a time when  rental car prices are increasing due to pandemic-induced supply chain issues. Challenges in the traditional car rental industry have certainly allowed Turo to gain some market share, despite steep competition, but that popularity has come with a cost at times, a reading of the risk factors portion of the S-1 shows.\n    Turo generated net revenue of $149.9 million in 2020, a 6% growth from the previous year, according to the S-1. Net losses were $97.1 million in 2020, a slight improvement from the $98.6 million in net losses it had in 2019.\n Turo points to a couple of drivers of its revenue growth, notably a digital tool called the Turo Risk Score. This feature, which launched in April 2020, dynamically adjusts the fees that Turo charges guests to complete a booking. Turo said this tool, along with hosts increasing the prices for vehicles that they charge to guests, contributed to its increased net revenue.\n   Turo says it generated $330.5 million in net revenue in the first nine months of 2021, a whopping 207% increase from $107.8 million for the same period in 2020. Its net losses also expanded as well. Turo reported a net loss of $129.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to $51.7 million for the same period in 2020.\n The reason? Turo notes in its S-1 that revenue increased as the number of days booked rose along with gross booking value per day.\n Scanning the S-1, it also appears that Turo tried to do more with less in 2020 and has since turned the financial faucet back on this year. The company tightened its spending in 2020, with operating expenses dropping from $133.9 million in 2019 to $95.8 million in 2020.\n The first nine months of 2021 tell a different story. The company\u2019s operating expenses in the first nine months of the year were $124.01 million compared to $71.6 million during the same period last year.\n  Risk factors facing the company include the obvious \u201cwhat if people don\u2019t use Turo\u201d and \u201cwe face competition\u201d from similar apps and traditional car rental companies. But a few others stick out.\n For one, Turo notes that the COVID-19 pandemic added volatility to its business. The company was forced to lay off staff and even closed its operations in Germany in 2020, only to have the business come roaring back to \u201cabove pre-Covid levels.\u201d\n The car rental app notes it may face liability for criminal activities of its hosts. There don\u2019t appear to be any lawsuits or fines, yet but in August last year,  Turo and other peer-to-peer rental apps were found to have been used by criminals for human trafficking and other crimes, a trend that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection admits is a growing trend near the border.\n Turo is also liable for lawsuits from cities \u2014 or more specifically airport authorities \u2014 that would require the long-time startup to obtain rental car permits. And in this area, Turo has in fact been sued and countersued. There have been four lawsuits regarding airport use and three of them, including one initiated by Turo versus the City of Los Angeles, have yet to be settled.\n  Despite potential risks, Turo estimates its current serviceable addressable market to be $146 billion and its total addressable market to be $230 billion.\n \u201cWe estimate that our $230 billion TAM includes $134 billion in North America, $65 billion in Europe, and $31 billion in the rest of the world (which consists of selected countries in which we believe we have a medium- to long-term opportunity to onboard hosts),\u201d according to the filing.\n Notably, the company appears to be ready to expand its operations within its home U.S. market as well as internationally. It also is ready to make some strategic acquisitions and partnerships \u201cto offer our hosts and guests services and features that we do not currently offer in-house.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-11 11:52:16", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6c7d\u8f66,ipo,\u9762\u4e34", "title": "\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u6c7d\u8f66\u5206\u4eab\u516c\u53f8Turo\u6587\u4ef6IPO\u516c\u5f00", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tPeer-to-peer car-sharing company Turo files IPO to go public\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/peer-to-peer-car-sharing-company-turo-files-ipo-to-go-public/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6c7d\u8f66", "ipo", "\u9762\u4e34"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5f7ca654add5665efc98d49cec2cc6a9.jpeg", "infoid": 1072723, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u798f\u7279\uff0cAV\u6280\u672f\u516c\u53f8ARGO AI\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u6b63\u5728\u4e0eARGO\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u5546\u4e1a\u5316\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6280\u672f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e24\u5bb6\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u5965\u65af\u6c40\uff0c\u8fc8\u963f\u5bc6\u548c\u534e\u76db\u987f\u5dde\u7acb\u4e86\u4e09\u5bb6\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8f66\u8f86\u4ed3\u5e93\uff0c\u4ee5\u5176\u5546\u4e1a\u5316\u8ba1\u5212\u3002\u8fbe\u62c9\u65af\u7684\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6700\u7ec8\u9009\u62e9\u4e86\u798f\u7279\uff0c\u90a3\u5c06\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002 \uff08ARGO\u8fd8\u62e5\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5339\u5179\u5821\uff0c\u5e95\u7279\u5f8b\u548c\u5e15\u6d1b\u963f\u5c14\u6258\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8230\u961f\u548c\u8bbe\u65bd\uff09\u3002\n\u5982\u679c\u8bae\u7a0b\u9879\u76ee\u4e0e\u8fbe\u62c9\u65af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u901a\u884c\uff0c\u798f\u7279\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5728\u4e94\u5e74\u7684\u8de8\u5ea6\u7a81\u7834\u5f81\u6536\u7a0e\u6536\u4f11\u606f\u65f6\u95f4\u8d85\u8fc7300\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u8be5\u5e02\u8fd8\u5c06\u7b79\u5907250,000\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u6279\u51c6\uff0c\u5efa\u8bbe\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u8be5\u8bbe\u65bd\u65e8\u5728\u4f4d\u4e8e2335\u8258\u4f2f\u94f6\u8857\u768432,361\u5e73\u65b9\u82f1\u5c3a\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3\u5176\u8ba8\u4ef7\u8fd8\u4ef7\u7684\u7ed3\u675f\uff0c\u798f\u7279\u9700\u8981\u5728\u8be5\u7269\u4e1a\u4e2d\u521b\u9020\u81f3\u5c11250\u9879\u65b0\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c97\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u6295\u8d44\u6700\u4f4e1.6\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u5305\u62ecAV\u8230\u961f\u3002\n\u798f\u7279\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8bc4\u8bba\u8fbe\u62c9\u65af\u5e02\u8bae\u4f1a\u7684\u8bae\u7a0b\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u79f0\u5b83\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u51b3\u5b9a\u6216\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u4f55\u989d\u5916\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u5e76\u201c\u8fd9\u662f\u5168\u90e8\u521d\u6b65\u201d\u3002", "note_en": "Ford, an investor and customer of AV technology company Argo AI, is working with Argo to commercialize the self-driving technology. The two companies have established three test vehicle depots in Austin, Miami and Washington D.C. in a run up to its commercialization plans. The facility in Dallas, if the location is ultimately chosen by Ford, would be similar to those operations. (Argo also has its own test fleets and facilities in Pittsburgh, Detroit and Palo Alto).\n The two companies plan to launch at least 1,000 self-driving vehicles on ride-hailing company Lyft\u2019s app in a number of cities over the next five years, beginning with Miami and Austin.\n  If the agenda item passes with Dallas\u2019s Office of Economic Development, Ford might be looking at over $3 million in proposed tax breaks over the span of five years. The city would also commit a $250,000 grant toward the construction of the facility, which is proposed to be located at a 32,361-square-foot space at 2335 Burbank Street. To meet its end of the bargain, Ford would need to create a minimum of 250 new jobs and invest a minimum of $160 million, including the AV fleet, at the property.\n The Dallas site is one of three final locations that Ford is scouting for its new AV facility,  according to city documents. The other two are in California, where Ford\u2019s AV unit already has a presence. However, Ford might see the benefits of building in Texas, a state that doesn\u2019t require permits to operate driverless autonomous vehicles. California, on the other hand,  requires separate permits for testing with a driver, testing without a driver, commercial autonomous delivery deployment and commercial robotaxi deployment.\n Ford would not comment on the Dallas City Council\u2019s agenda item, saying it has not made any decisions or chosen any additional cities to expand to, and that \u201cthis is all preliminary.\u201d\n \u201cFord is building its self-driving business for ride-hailing and goods delivery in Austin, Texas, Miami and Washington, D.C., and focused on building a profitable self-driving business,\u201d the company told TechCrunch. \u201cScaling this technology is key, driving us to explore a variety of cities in the U.S. to expand our self-driving services.

Existing investors who returned for its latest round include Quona Capital, Triodos Investment Management, Saison Capital, ACV and East Ventures. The new funds will be used for hiring about 400 new employees and scaling KoinWorks\u2019 latest suite of products, SME Neobank.\n KoinWorks is headquartered in Jakarta, with holding in Singapore and tech offices in Yogyakarta, India and Vietnam. KoinWorks was originally created to help SMEs, which are often turned away by traditional financial institutions, get access to working capital. Since then, it has also developed a comprehensive platform of financial tools to help its customers, including e-commerce vendors and social commerce sellers, increase their sales.\n  TechCrunch  first profiled KoinWorks in 2019 when it raised $12 million for its lending platform. Demand increased as more businesses went online during the COVID-19 pandemic and the startup says its user base tripled to 1.5 million customers, and a waitlist of 100,000 SMEs who are being onboarded onto its new financial software. Co-founder and executive chairman Willy Arifin told TechCrunch in an email that since 2019, monthly loan disbursements have also tripled to nearly $50 million and revenue had quadrupled.\n KoinWorks focuses on SMEs that are underserved by traditional financial institutions and may not have a bank account or credit cards. On the platform, users can create an online bank account and card, borrow working capital, and access accounting, point-of-sale, early wage access and human resources management systems tailored for small businesses.\n Arifin said that since KoinWorks\u2019 monthly disbursement rate reached $50 million a month, its take rate has grown enough that the company became cash flow positive earlier this year, and its non-performing loan (NPL) percentage is lower than 2%. He says banks serving traditional SMEs have at least double KoinWorks\u2019 NPL. \u201cAs many as 20% of businesses shifted their sales channels offline to online during the pandemic, and 89% of businesses now use online channels to sell their products and services,\u201d he said.\n Over the last three years, KoinWorks\u2019 competitors have grown to include other neobanks and startups that started out as accounting software but are expanding to include working capital loans and other financial services. Two notable examples included rivals BukuWarung and BukuKas, both of which have raised significant rounds of funding.\n   \u201cWhen we started out, we were among hundreds of traditional financial institutions. Fast forward to the present day, we are seeing those same banks now undergo digitalization,\u201d Arifin said. \u201cDespite that, Indonesia\u2019s yearly funding gap is $80 billion USD, so those who remain unbanked or underbanked are still at a disadvantage. There\u2019s still a lot of room for improvement\u201d\n He added that with tens of millions of entrepreneurs in Indonesia, \u201cit\u2019s not a winner-takes-all market.\u201d The top five banks in the country have a combined market value of close to $160 billion USD. There will undoubtedly be fintech companies out there tackling the unbanked/underbanked space, however, KoinWorks has a best in class approach tailored to the needs of SMEs and entrepreneurs that we believe will have a significant impact on the future sector.\n  In a statement, MDI Ventures CEO Donald Wiharia said, \u201cInvesting in KoinWorks is investing in the financial literacy of underbanked and underserved communities. We are ecstatic to be in concert with a team that understands the importance of each step in the journey of entrepreneurship and SME growth.\u201c", "posttime": "2022-01-11 11:50:43", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a,koinworks", "title": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c5\u52a0\u8fbe\u7684\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u91d1\u878d\u5e73\u53f0Koinworks Scoops US $ 108M\u7cfb\u5217C.", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tJakarta-based SME financial platform KoinWorks scoops up $108M Series C\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/jakarta-based-sme-financial-platform-koinworks-scoops-up-108m-series-c/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a", "koinworks"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "53131827bf467c4d7f4653c6ef95644b.jpg", "infoid": 1072721, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "1967\u5e746\u6708\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2aCES\u6d3b\u52a8\u5438\u5f15\u4e8617,500\u540d\u4e0e\u4f1a\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8bb8\u591a\u4eba\u7fa4\u88abGE\u7684\u65b0\u6b3e24\u78c5\u5f69\u8272\u7535\u89c6\u4ee4\u4eba\u773c\u82b1\u7f2d\u4e71\u3002\u5728\u4ecb\u5165\u6570\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f1a\u8bae\u589e\u957f\u5982\u6b64\u4e4b\u591a\uff0c\u5b83\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u91cd\u529b\u3002\u6839\u636e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8005\uff0c2020\u5e74\u4e3e\u884c\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4f4d\u57282020\u5e74\u4e3e\u884c\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86171,268\u4eba\u3002\n\u6839\u636e\u62c9\u7ef4\u52a0\u65af\u5ba1\u67e5\u671f\u520a\uff0c\u53ea\u670940,000\u4eba\u53c2\u52a0\u3002\u8fd9\u662f75\uff05\u7684\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\n\u57282014\u5e74\u5de6\u53f3\u7684\u67d0\u4e2a\u5730\u65b9\u5de6\u53f3\uff0cCES\u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u573a\u8f66\u5c55\u3002\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u5265\u593a\u4e86\u4eba\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u53d8\u79cd\uff0c\u5373\u5c06\u5931\u53bb\u6c7d\u8f66\u5149\u6cfd\u7684CES 2022\u3002\n\u5c55\u4f1a\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u7f3a\u5e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u8f66\u8f86\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u7684\u516c\u544a\u548c\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u4e00\u4e9b\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u4eba\u5305\u62ecLas Vegas Speedway\u7684\u5934\u8111\u524d\u5f80\u81ea\u4e3b\u8d5b\u9a6c\u573a\uff0cGM\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98Mary Barra\u6253\u7b97\u5728\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\u51fa\u552e\u4e2a\u4eba\u81ea\u6cbb\u8f66\u8f86\uff08\u867d\u7136\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u7f3a\u5931\uff09\u548c\u82f1\u7279\u5c14\u5b50\u516c\u53f8\u79fb\u52a8\u5f0f\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u4e3a\u5e02\u573a\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8d85\u7ea7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7ed9\u4e58\u7528\u8f66\uff0c\u5361\u8f66\u548cSUV\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6743\u529b\u3002\u5f53\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9a7e\u9a76\u5df2\u7ecf\u63d0\u51fa\u6765\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u672a\u6765\u7684\u627f\u8bfa\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u72ed\u9698\u5730\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5982\u505c\u8f66\u573a - \u6216\u4e24\u8005\u3002\u79fb\u52a8\u5f0f\u516c\u544a\u6307\u5411CES 2022\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u4e4b\u4e00\uff1a\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "note_en": "The first CES event in June 1967 drew 17,500 attendees, where many in the crowd were absolutely dazzled by GE\u2019s new 24-pound color television. In the intervening decades, the conference grew so much, it essentially created its own gravity. The last in-person CES held in 2020 attracted a total verified attendance of 171,268, according to organizers.\n The trade show shifted to online-only in 2021, but CES returned last week, even though many exhibitors and publications (including this one) declined to send representatives, citing the ongoing omicron surge. \u201cIt\u2019s time we return to making the world better rather than living in fear,\u201d wrote Consumer Trade Association president and CEO Gary Shapiro  in an opinion column.\n But just 40,000 people attended,  according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. That\u2019s a 75% decline.\n If an event only attracts 25% of its usual crowd, for whom is it essential? Today, TechCrunch Transportation Editor Kirsten Korosec, Hardware Editor Brian Heater and reporter Haje Jan Kamps shared their thoughts on CES 2022:\n    Somewhere around 2014 or so, CES turned into a car show. And even with the latest variant of COVID derailing in-person plans for many companies, CES 2022 didn\u2019t lose its automotive luster.\n This year was different in a few respects, signaling that the automotive industry has taken a few cupfuls of we-really-need-revenue punch. Technology that is further away from commercialization showed up, but not in the same force as in previous years. CES 2022 was not the year for evtols, hyperloop, and to a lesser degree, autonomous vehicle technology.\n  Autonomous vehicle technology wasn\u2019t absent from the show, and there were some key announcements and activities. A few of the notable ones included the head-to-head autonomous racecar competition at the Las Vegas Speedway, GM CEO Mary Barra\u2019s intention to  sell personal autonomous vehicles\u00a0by mid-decade (although some key details were missing) and Intel subsidiary Mobileye\u2019s plan to bring a new\u00a0 supercomputer to market\u00a0designed to give passenger cars, trucks and SUVs autonomous driving powers.\u00a0When automated driving did come up, it was often in the form of future promises, narrowly defined autonomous features like parking \u2014 or both.The Mobileye announcement points to one of the themes at CES 2022: compute.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 11:49:55", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

"note_en": "In fact, silly as it sounds, try being  more worried about it than seems normal. After all, for-profit biometric data collection has undergone an astounding degree of normalization in the last decade. The idea of Apple scanning your fingerprint on a daily basis once sounded startling. Now it\u2019s how we unlock our banking app and our laptop \u2014 unless, of course, we do it with our face. It\u2019s gone mainstream.\n We embraced FaceID, thumbprint scanning and similar functions specifically because they are convenient. No passcode, no problem.\n  Corporations and businesses saw this, and now convenience is among the two biggest reasons typically given for the adoption of biometric data collection \u2013 the other is public safety, which we\u2019ll get to later. Quick biometric scans, we\u2019re told, make things faster and easier.\n In a bid to save time, a number of primary schools throughout the U.K. recently  implemented facial scanning for lunch payment. Several schools ended up suspending the program after data privacy experts and parents  pushed back. They argued convenience was not exactly worth the price of the accumulation of an entire database of young children\u2019s faces stored on a server somewhere. And they\u2019re right.\n  This September, U.S. ticketing company AXS announced a flagship program to use Amazon One palm-print scanners at Red Rocks Amphitheater as an optional alternative to print or mobile concert tickets ( with plans to expand into additional venues in the coming months). The decision was met with  immediate resistance from both privacy experts and musicians, and it was hardly the first flashpoint over biometric data collection within the live music industry.\n In 2019, major promoters LiveNation and AEG (which coordinates major festivals such as Coachella)  stepped back from plans to invest in and implement facial recognition technology at concerts after public outcry from fans and artists.\n  But the fight over the use of biometric recognition during live entertainment is far from settled. When the coronavirus pandemic sent professional sports executives who depend on full stadiums back to the drawing board, their new plans often incorporated mass facial recognition. Faces would replace tickets, and this would ostensibly make everyone safer from the virus.\n These executives are determined. The Dutch football team AFC Ajax is seeking to reinstall its pilot facial recognition program that was initially halted by data protection regulators. Henk van Raan, the chief innovation officer of Ajax\u2019s home field, Amsterdam ArenA, was  quoted in The Wall Street Journal as saying, \u201cHopefully we use this coronavirus pandemic to change rules. The coronavirus is a bigger enemy than [any threat to] privacy.\u201d\n This is terrible reasoning, as the risks posed to our privacy are in no way mitigated or lessened by our risk to a virus.\n In the same article, Shaun Moore, CEO of facial-recognition supplier Trueface, described his conversations with professional sports executives as overwhelmingly concerned with touch points by sidestepping the handing over of credentials, citing the risk of virus transmission while scanning ticket barcodes.\n This is a stretch, and you don\u2019t need to be an epidemiologist to call it one. When the main event involves a big crowd of people yelling and cheering next to one another, it\u2019s probably not the momentary masked interaction when an agent scans a ticket that is worth worrying about. As the safety argument falls apart, so does the convenience one. The simple fact is that our lives are not made exponentially and meaningfully better by the replacement of a mobile ticket with our palm print. Those extra five seconds are a moot point.\n It\u2019s interesting to see van Raan speak so directly about using the pandemic to override privacy protections and concerns. But his reasoning is frightening and flawed.\n Yes, the coronavirus is a real threat, but it\u2019s not an \u201cenemy.\u201d It\u2019s not embodied, nor does it have a motive. It\u2019s a virus. It is outside human control. In insurance terms, it\u2019s an \u201cact of God.\u201d And it\u2019s being used to justify something that is very much in human control: The huge uptick in biometric data collection under the guise of public safety or convenience.\n  Public safety is often the cause upon which increased biometric surveillance is foisted. In August, U.S. lawmakers  introduced a mandate that would require auto manufactures to include passive technology in new cars to prevent drunken drivers from starting vehicles. That \u201cpassive\u201d tech could end up being anything from eye-scanning devices and breathalyzers to an infrared sensor that tests BAC levels through the skin.\n Sure, this is a seemingly noble cause with a respectable motive. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that drunken driving kills nearly 10,000 people per year; the European Commission  lists a similar number for the EU.\n But where is all that data going? Where is it being stored? Who is it being sold to, and what do they plan to do with it? The privacy risks are too great.\n The pandemic obliterated many of the obstacles standing in the way of the adoption of mass biometric data collection, and the consequences will be disastrous for civil liberties if it\u2019s allowed to continue in this manner. The intensity of surveillance is ramping up in record time, making governments and for-profit corporations privy to that most private minutiae of our lives and bodies.\n A mobile ticket is surveillance enough \u2013 it announces to the system you\u2019ve entered the venue at an exact time, after all. Don\u2019t fix it if it\u2019s not broken! And don\u2019t add biometric data collection just because you can under the shaky guise of not spreading germs.\n Give out as little biometric data as possible, period. It\u2019s not enough to avoid giving your biometric data to Google or Amazon specifically, given those corporations\u2019 abysmal records when it comes to, say, basic human rights and civil liberties.\n A smaller company unaffiliated with your typical tech giant might feel like less of a threat, but don\u2019t be fooled. The moment Amazon or Google acquires that company, they acquire your and everyone else\u2019s biometric data with it. And we\u2019re back where we started.\n A safe society need not be a heavily surveilled society. We built increasingly safe and healthy societies for centuries without the use of a single video camera. And beyond safety, heavy surveillance that is this detailed and individualized is the death knell of a society that values civil liberties.\n Maybe that\u2019s what this all comes down to.

If protein isolates are produced in the correct way, so to be safe, they could be considered as human food in the future.\u201d\n \u201cThe whole point about gorse is it is actively being removed from marginal lands \u2013 it\u2019s something we can gain protein from at no extra cost,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a huge amount of gorse all over  Scotland and when we did the calculations, just by active removal from marginal land, there\u2019s enough gorse protein to easily feed [Scotland\u2019s] population.\u201d\n Russell was speaking at a Science Media Centre event on alternative proteins which looked at the health and environmental benefits and drawbacks of alternatives to meat and dairy. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) launched a  polling report at the event that showed 60% of people in the UK were willing to try plant-based alternatives to meat and dairy; a third were willing to try lab-grown meat and a quarter were willing to try edible insects.\n Livestock and fodder production occupies  83% of the world\u2019s farmland but produces only 18% of protein. It also has a very heavy environmental impact, driving the climate crisis and pollution. Studies have shown  sharp cuts in meat eating in rich nations are needed to halt global heating.\n From 1950 to 2000 the global population doubled, but meat intake increased fivefold, said Russell. Continuing this trend in the future is not feasible for the environment, she said: \u201cWe really do have to change our diet.\u201d\n Scotland has little arable land, which is why Russell examined invasive plants on marginal land. \u201cWhen you make a protein isolate from gorse, 57% of the total leaf protein can be recovered at up to 95% purity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re using about 4.5 to 6kg of CO 2 to produce [a kilogram of] isolate, compared to an average for meat of 102kg of CO 2.\u201d\n Fifteen Scottish farmers also planted hemp this year for the first time, Russell said. \u201cThey\u2019re really concerned about the climate and want to do their best. They really are optimistic about the commercial viability of the crop and its climate credentials.\u201d\n Russell, who leads the Scottish government\u2019s strategic research programme on food systems and supply, added: \u201cThese alternative plant proteins are very healthy, high protein, high in fibre, and high in micronutrients.\u201d\n Prof Robin May, the chief scientific adviser at the FSA said: \u201cThere is a huge potential for novel proteins to have massive benefits in terms of environmental benefit, nutritional benefit, and access of a wider population [to good food]. Our priority is to do everything possible to help businesses get those novel, innovative products safely onto the shelves as swiftly as possible.\u201d\n May said that while many people were reluctant to try new products, such as lab-grown meat, a quarter said they would change their minds if they were confident it was safe and well regulated. \u201cThat\u2019s where we play a key role,\u201d said May.\n Lab-grown meat went on sale for the first time in December 2020 in Singapore. Proponents say they are produced in clean facilities and do not carry the risk of bacterial contamination of meat from livestock.\n In the FSA poll, 90% of people said they had heard of plant-based alternatives and 78% said they had heard of lab grown meat.\n Neil Shah, at the Edison Group investment research firm, which published a report on lab-grown meat on Monday, said: \u201cThe cultivated meat industry is booming as a result of increased appetite for ethical and environmentally friendly alternatives to conventional meat. The sector has already begun attracting significant investor interest as it offers the chance to enter an industry which could disrupt the global meat market over the coming decades.\u201d\n A 2019 report by consultancy AT Kearney predicted that  most of the meat people eat in 2040 will not come from slaughtered animals.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 11:42:51", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u86cb\u767d\u8d28,gorse", "title": "\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bf4\uff0c\u6765\u81eaGorse\u704c\u6728\u4e1b\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u53ef\u4ee5\u517b\u6d3b\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u4eba", "title_en": "Protein From Gorse Bushes Could Feed Millions of People, Says Expert", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/10/protein-from-gorse-bushes-could-feed-millions-of-people-says-expert", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u86cb\u767d\u8d28", "gorse"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e91f8f8fffce6f53f110d2ad66ac2980.jpg", "infoid": 1072718, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u661f\u671f\u516d\uff0cAndroid Boss Hiroshi Lockheimer\u6307\u8d23Apple\u7684\u201c\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u4f34\u538b\u529b\u548c\u6b3a\u51cc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9500\u552e\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u201d\uff0c\u5728\u534e\u5c14\u8857\u65e5\u62a5\u62a5\u544a\u540e\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u5982\u4f55\u5c06Apple\u7684Imessage\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u9501\u5b9aAndroid\u7528\u6237\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5730\u4f4d\u7b26\u53f7\u3002\n\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u8981\u6c42Apple\u5728Android\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5de8\u578b\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8981\u6c42Apple\u652f\u6301IMESSage\u4e2d\u73b0\u4ee3\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\uff08RCS\uff09\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5c31\u50cf\u652f\u6301\u65e7\u7684SMS / MMS\u6807\u51c6\u4e00\u6837\u3002\n\u201c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u5305\u542bRCS\uff0cApple\u6b63\u5728\u963b\u6b62\u884c\u4e1a\u5e76\u904f\u5236\u200b\u200b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662fAndroid\u7528\u6237\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u8fd8\u6301\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\uff0c\u201d\u5728Twitter\u7ebf\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7a0d\u540e\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u6d1b\u514b\u6d77\u9ed8\u3002\n\u5728\u9501\u5b9a\u524d\u9762\uff0c\u5173\u4e8eApple\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u611f\u8c22epic v\u3002\u82f9\u679c\u5ba1\u5224\uff0c\u4e16\u754c\u73b0\u5728\u5df2\u7ecf\u770b\u5230\u4e86\u82f9\u679c\u9ad8\u7ba1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u673a\u5bc6\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u516c\u53f8\u6545\u610f\u6263\u7559IMessage\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9501\u5b9a\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u62c5\u5fc3Android\u4e0a\u7684IMESSage\u5c06\u53ea\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u5220\u9664\u4e00\u4e2a\u969c\u788d\u7684iPhone\u5bb6\u5ead\u7ed9\u5b69\u5b50Android\u624b\u673a\uff0c\u201dApple Exec Craig Federighi\u4e8e2013\u5e744\u6708\u5199\u9053\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u201c\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528Android\u5ba2\u6237\u4f7f\u7528\u5e76\u4f9d\u8d56Apple\u4ea7\u54c1\u3002 \u3002\u201c\n\u66f4\u6e05\u695a\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u8c37\u6b4c\u652f\u6301\u7684\u77ed\u4fe1\u662frcs\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u7eb3\u5165imessage\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9Apple\u7b7e\u7f72\u4e86\u4efb\u4f55\u4ee4\u4eba\u4fe1\u670d\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8c37\u6b4c\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u70b9\u51fb\u538b\u529b\u3002\n\u4f46\u73b0\u5728\u4e5f\u8bb8\u82f9\u679c\u516c\u53f8\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u8d1f\u8377\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u80ae\u810f\u6d17\u8863\u623f\uff08\u4ee5\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u5f62\u5f0f\uff09\u88ab\u64ad\u51fa\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u9762\u524d\uff0c\u5176\u5458\u5de5\u6b63\u5728\u53d1\u8868\u8bb2\u8bdd\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u50cfWSJ\u4e00\u6837\u7684\u788e\u7247\u662f\u51fa\u6765\u7684\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u8482\u59c6\u53a8\u5e08\u53ef\u80fd\u6b63\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u6bd4\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u6269\u5927\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u9057\u4ea7\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6210\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8102\u80aa\u5305\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1......\u4e5f\u8bb8\u4e3aAndroid\u5e26\u6765\u4e86IMessage\u6216\u8005\u5bf9imessage\u7684rcs\u662f\u82f9\u679c\u53ef\u80fd\u5b9e\u9645\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u90a3\u79cd\u5c0f\u7279\u8bb8\u6743\u3002", "note_en": "On Saturday, Android boss Hiroshi Lockheimer  accused Apple of \u201cusing peer pressure and bullying as a way to sell products,\u201d after  a  Wall Street Journal report revealed how US teens have turned Apple\u2019s iMessage into a social status symbol that locks Android users out.\n Now, Lockheimer is taking a slightly less abrasive stance: the Google executive  said Monday that \u201cwe\u2019re not asking Apple to make iMessage available on Android. We\u2019re asking Apple to support the industry standard for modern messaging (RCS) in iMessage, just as they support the older SMS / MMS standards.\u201d\n We\u2019re not asking Apple to make iMessage available on Android. We\u2019re asking Apple to support the industry standard for modern messaging (RCS) in iMessage, just as they support the older SMS / MMS standards.\n\u2014 Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer)  January 10, 2022\n \u201cBy not incorporating RCS, Apple is holding back the industry and holding back the user experience for not only Android users but also their own customers,\u201d  adds Lockheimer, later in the Twitter thread.\n That\u2019s still a big accusation, but one that pulls the conversation back into familiar territory: will Apple  accept Google\u2019s olive branch to make iMessage more compatible with Android, or will it continue to use lock-in to sell more iPhones?\n On the lock-in front, there\u2019s little question about Apple\u2019s motivation. Thanks to the  Epic v. Apple trial,  the world has now seen confidential emails between Apple executives that show the company is intentionally withholding iMessage in favor of lock-in. \u201cI am concerned the iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones,\u201d  wrote Apple exec Craig Federighi in April 2013, adding \u201cI think we need to get Android customers using and dependent on Apple products.\u201d\n \u201cJoz and I think moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us, this email illustrates why,\u201d  wrote Apple\u2019s Phil Schiller in March 2016, forwarding an email from Beats Music co-founder Ian Rogers about how he \u201cmissed a ton of messages from friends and family\u201d after switching to an Android phone.\n What\u2019s less clear is whether RCS,  the next-gen replacement for SMS that\u2019s championed by Google and incorporates popular features common to iMessage, has any convincing reason for Apple to sign on. That\u2019s likely why Google is creating a little peer pressure of its own.\n  The Verge has asked Apple if it intends to support RCS  literally years with no comment, so we\u2019re not holding our breath. We\u2019ve also made  the moral case that a company that claims privacy is a human right has a duty to bring encrypted messaging to the world, not just its own customers, and we\u2019ve written about  the personal plight of dealing with Apple\u2019s inaction. (And when I say \u201cwe\u201d, I mean Dieter, because RCS is his jam, I\u2019m writing this post because he\u2019s on vacation, and Dieter srsly why are you reading these words, aren\u2019t you supposed to be on a socially distanced beach somewhere?)\n But maybe now that Apple  is basically a three-trillion dollar company, and it\u2019s under loads of regulatory scrutiny, and its dirty laundry (in the form of emails) has been aired in front of the world, and  its employees are speaking out, and pieces like the  WSJ\u2019s are coming out, and its CEO Tim Cook is likely looking for a legacy  larger than simply scaling up the company to become the most valuable in the world with  a fat pay package as the reward... perhaps bringing iMessage to Android or RCS to iMessage is the kind of small concession that Apple might actually make.\n Correction, 7:48PM ET : Dieter informs me Apple did actually reply to our requests for comment on RCS. Their reply was \u201cNo comment.\u201d I regret the error.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 11:19:21", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "apple,android,lead", "title": "Android Lead Hiroshi Lockheimer\u8868\u793a\uff0cApple\u662f\u201c\u963b\u6b62\u201d\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662fAndroid\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4e0d\u652f\u6301IMessage\u4e2d\u7684RCS", "title_en": "Android lead Hiroshi Lockheimer says Apple is \u201cholding back\u201d the messaging experience for not just Android but its own users by not supporting RCS in iMessage", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877304/google-lockheimer-accuse-apple-imessage-holding-back-rcs-text-sms?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4", "via": "", "real_tags": ["apple", "android", "lead"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072716, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "CREV\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\u3002 CREV  - \u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u67097\u4e2a\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\u3002\u5728github\u4e0a\u9075\u5faa\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "note_en": "Repositories for the crev project. crev - Code REView system has 7 repositories available.

"note_en": "Milton Friedman\u2019s interest rate fallacy is one of the most mystifying and counterintuitive facts in modern finance. Modern economists and financial analysts often assume (and operate under the assumption) that central bankers have near complete control over interest rates, especially in the era of trigger-happy central bank officials who are all too excited to initiate asset purchases at the first sign of financial instability. The average economist and financial market participant automatically associate high interest rates with tight monetary policies and therefore tight monetary conditions in the economy,  even though it goes against the evidence and experience of the past decade, as well as of the majority of economic history prior to that.\n  After the U.S. experience during the Great Depression, and after inflation and rising interest rates in the 1970s and disinflation and falling interest rates in the 1980s, I thought the fallacy of identifying tight money with high interest rates and easy money with low interest rates was dead. Apparently, old fallacies never die. 1\n In various previous issues of  Monetary Mechanics ( Issue #10,  Issue #12, and  Issue #19), I talked about the part that the Federal Reserve plays in setting monetary policy, how monetary policy affects the economy, and (most importantly) the fact that frequently  the actual monetary conditions in the economy do not perfectly align with the applied monetary policies.\n While many people have referenced Friedman\u2019s fallacy in the past, I have not encountered an explanation that is capable of  correctly and  clearly explaining what Friedman is attempting to communicate.  The primary problem here is that most people acknowledge and accept that interest rates are the   price  of credit, but pay no or almost no attention to the   volume  of credit. I believe that what most people associate with \u201ceasy money\u201d is in fact not \u201ccheap credit,\u201d but is instead a high volume of credit. Moreover, almost everyone assumes that because interest rates are low, and credit is cheap, that credit must also be abundant, because why would it not be?\n This is because almost everyone is thinking about and taking into account only  the demand side \u2013 most people would love to borrow at low interest rates, so most people presume that low interest rates must mean that credit is both cheap and plentiful. However, not thinking about and taking into account  the supply side of the picture, the banks and institutional investors who must make the decisions about who to lend to and at what interest rates, paints a misleading picture.\n   The figure above is a bit busy, so I will break down the various components.\n The main feature of this figure is a demonstration of the different rates of credit issuance (through loans and bonds) in different market regimes. One can see that  before 1965, loans were the dominant form of credit extension, and that  after 1984, bonds became the dominant form of credit extension. The left axis denotes the year-over-year volume of credit issuance.\n The right axis and shaded green area denote the Effective Federal Funds Rate (EFFR) throughout the same period of time. The EFFR functions as a proxy for the general level of interest rates in the economy. One can see that there is  a strong correlation between the volume of credit issuance and the level of interest rates in the   opposite  direction that many might expect. Consequently, the periods of time with the highest volume of credit issuance are also the periods of time with the highest level of interest rates.\n According to traditional economic theory, high levels of interest rates lead to reduced levels of credit issuance (through loans and bonds) because high levels of interest rates increase the cost of borrowing. According to the figure above, however, it seems that markets are totally indifferent to the level of interest rates. In fact,  the volume of credit issuance and the level of interest rates seem to exhibit   a positive, not negative,  correlation. Basically, what this means is that low levels of interest rates tend to correspond to market regimes with low levels of credit issuance.\n One can also see the same positive correlation between the volume of credit issuance and the level of interest rates during several other periods of time, including the period immediately preceding and following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, as well as the re-emergence of the private Federal Funds market after the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord in the mid-1950s.\n   Both of the figures above show the same strange positive correlation between borrowing volumes and interest rate levels.  What is going on here?\n I believe that Friedman\u2019s fallacy is best understood through the lens of borrowers as engaging in active liability management and as bidding for funding/financing. During more prosperous times, when the economy is rapidly and robustly growing, businesses and financial institutions are happy to keep extending credit at ever increasing interest rates, because the returns on invested capital are high. During less prosperous times, when the economy is uncertain, fewer businesses are willing to leverage their balance sheets, and perhaps much more importantly, fewer financial institutions are willing to extend credit to all but the largest and most reputable borrowers.\n Now, some people may argue that during the recent period of record low interest rates, all sorts of companies have been able to obtain funding/financing, and we have seen a junk bond explosion like never before. There is some truth to that argument, as funding/financing terms are at some of the easiest as they have been in decades, and junk bond spreads are at lows like never before.\n  However, the focus on junk bonds misses a few important points.  Credit markets, while not as liquid and tradable as equity or rates markets, are   still liquid and tradable  markets, unlike bank loans. Hence, an equivalent credit should trade more expensively as a security than as a bank loan because the buyer of the security can always sell the security in a fire sale when necessary.\n In addition,  credit market instruments can be bought by institutional investors who are not beholden to the same burdensome legislations/regulations that banks have become subject to since the GFC. These institutional investors have  much more balance sheet capacity to hold instruments of questionable creditworthiness than global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), who are far more focused on maintaining their liquidity coverage ratios (LCRs), staying within their supplementary leverage ratios (SLRs), and generally maximizing profit per unit of balance sheet space (usually through nettable activity or by selling bespoke or exotic derivatives).\n When judging whether or not the entire economy is \u201coverleveraged,\u201d it is important to look at the bigger picture. This means not just looking at the record amount of debt securities that Apple is able to issue at rock-bottom interest rates, or even the ease with which private equity firms are able to issue leveraged loans from their portfolio companies, but also looking at what the vast majority of regular small and medium sized businesses are doing.  Thus, it is not what you see, but what you do not see, that is most important.\n  If credit was really as cheap and widely available/accessible as it is often claimed to be, then why have annual small business loan originations still not recovered and reached levels seen in the early 2000s? This is because small businesses have  unquantifiable risks and are truly risky, not only in the sense of  potential default risk, but much more importantly in the sense of  liquidity risk. Consequently, one can very easily see  tight monetary conditions among the 60-80% of small and medium sized private businesses that power the US economy but are not large or creditworthy enough to issue publicly traded debt securities.\n In summary, Friedman\u2019s fallacy is derived from two fundamental, yet counterintuitive, observations of economic history. One,  when the economy is rapidly and robustly growing, and there are plenty of profitable investment opportunities,  interest rates tend to increase, as both financial and non-financial institutions bid for funding/financing to take advantage of the differential between the current interest rates and the future returns on invested capital. Two,  rather than differentiate between good or bad credit based only on price (via higher or lower interest rates),  banks and institutional investors also differentiate between good or bad credit based on access, so that uncreditworthy businesses are altogether excluded from global debt markets, counterintuitively causing falling, rather than rising, interest rates as credit is contracting.\n In conclusion, one can theorize that  falling interest rates can be indicative of tight monetary conditions in the economy in the sense that demand for credit is falling (due to explanation one) and/or access to debt funding/financing is limited to just the largest and most creditworthy businesses (due to explanation two). 2\n      1 Milton Friedman, \u201cReviving Japan,\u201d  Hoover Digest, April 30, 1998.

In this case, wages were not actually rising across the economy, particularly when one takes into account the low paid hospitality workers, such as restaurant hosts and servers, who were furloughed or laid off.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 11:04:13", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5229\u7387,friedman,\u4fe1\u8d37", "title":

This pretty much sums up modern society; don\u2019t get it, don\u2019t want to try and get it, so it\u2019s meh. Give them more action and they will complain that it\u2019s over the top.

Change things like that and you have made something completely out of sync with the franchise. I also laugh at all the people saying this movie didn\u2019t need to be made. NO movie ever needs to be made. It\u2019s entertainment! Let it be made, let it be like by whom ever likes it and move on if you didn\u2019t like it. Simple. I was able to easily grasp every aspect of the storyline and why things happened. I enjoyed the special effects and even the minimal fight scenes, as too much more and it would have been another Matrix Reloaded. I didn\u2019t expect to be blown a away but I did enjoy it. I read that Hugo Weaving was in talks to take the role of agent smith again but it fell through due to scheduling conflicts. I think even that recast worked out in the movie\u2019s favor. Lastly, I do feel the sorry ended somewhat anticlimactic but this was no doubt due to them wanting to make another sequel, going off then ending from this one. Of course they had hoped that this got great reviews and left the audience wanting another. Sadly, even I think they should have just ended this by destroying the machines in some epic way. If they wanted to make one more it could have been something completely non-matrix and all real world and how they rebuild it all.

HPC applications typically require instances with high memory bandwidth, a low latency, high bandwidth network interconnect and access to a fast parallel file system.\n  Many customers have turned to AWS to run their HPC workloads. For example, Descartes Labs used AWS to power a  TOP500 LINPACK benchmarking (the most powerful commercially available computer systems) run that delivered 1.93 PFLOPS, landing at position 136 on the TOP500 list in June 2019. That run made use of 41,472 cores on a cluster of  Amazon EC2 C5 instances. Last year Descartes Labs ran the LINPACK benchmark again and placed within the  top 40 on the June 2021 TOP500 list with 172,692 cores on a cluster of EC2 instances, which represents a 417 percent performance increase in just two years.\n  AWS enables you to increase the speed of research and reduce time-to-results by running HPC in the cloud and scaling to tens of thousands of parallel tasks that wouldn\u2019t be practical in most on-premises environments. AWS helps you reduce costs by providing  CPU,  GPU, and  FPGA instances on-demand,  Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA), an EC2 network device that improves throughput and scaling tightly coupled workloads, and  AWS ParallelCluster, an open-source cluster management tool that makes it easy for you to deploy and manage HPC clusters on AWS.\n  Announcing EC2 Hpc6a Instances for HPC Workloads  Customers today across various industries use compute-optimized EFA-enabled Amazon EC2 instances (for example,  C5n,  R5n, M5n, and  M5zn) to maximize the performance of a variety of HPC workloads, but as these workloads scale to tens of thousands of cores, cost-efficiency becomes increasingly important. We have found that customers are not only looking to optimize performance for their HPC workloads but want to optimize costs as well.\n  As we  pre-announced in November 2021,  Hpc6a, a new HPC-optimized EC2 instance, is generally available beginning today. This instance delivers 100 Gbps networking through EFA with 96 third-generation AMD EPYC\u2122 processor (Milan) cores with 384 GB RAM, and offers up to 65 percent better price-performance over comparable x86-based compute-optimized instances.\n  You can launch Hpc6a instances today in the US East (Ohio) and GovCloud (US-West) Regions in  On-Demand and  Dedicated Hosting\u00a0or as part of a  Savings Plan. Here are the detailed specs:\n      To enable predictable thread performance and efficient scheduling for HPC workloads, simultaneous multi-threading is disabled. Thanks to  AWS Nitro System, no cores are held back for the hypervisor, making all cores available to your code.\n  Hpc6a instances introduce a number of targeted features to deliver cost and performance optimizations for customers running tightly coupled HPC workloads that rely on high levels of inter-instance communications. These instances enable EFA networking bandwidth of 100 Gbps and are designed to efficiently scale large tightly coupled clusters within a single Availability Zone.\n  We hear from many of our engineering customers, such as those in the automotive sector, that they want to reduce the need for physical testing and move towards an increasingly virtual simulation-based product design process faster at a lower cost.\n  According to our benchmarking results for Siemens Simcenter STAR-CCM+ automotive CFD simulation, when the Hpc6a scales up to 400 nodes (approximately 40,000 cores), with the help of EFA networking, it is able to maintain approximately 100 percent scaling efficiency. Hpc6a instance shows 70 percent lower cost compared to c5n, meaning companies can deliver new designs faster and at a lower cost when using Hpc6a instances. This means companies can deliver new designs faster and at a lower cost when using Hpc6a instances.\n    You can use the Hpc6a instance with AMD EPYC third-generation (Milan) processors to run your largest and most complex HPC simulations on EC2 and optimize for cost and performance. Customers can also use the new Hpc6a instances with  AWS Batch and  AWS ParallelCluster to simplify workload submission and cluster creation.\n  To learn more, visit our   Hpc6a instance page and get in touch with  our HPC team,  AWS re:Post for EC2, or through your usual AWS Support contacts.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 10:53:20", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6027\u80fd,amazon,ec2,hpc", "title": "Amazon EC2 HPC6A\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4f18\u5316", "title_en": "Amazon EC2 Hpc6a Instance Optimized for High Performance Computing", "transed": 1, "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-hpc6a-instance-optimized-for-high-performance-computing/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6027\u80fd", "amazon", "ec2", "hpc"]}]
