She was a public school teacher at the time, and she knew how hard it was to convince people to support even modest financial benefits, like pay raises for her coworkers. “Giving people money? I couldn’t wrap my head around it,” she says. “You can’t just  give people money.”</p><p>几年前，当Elizabeth Softky首次听到普遍基本收入的概念时，她有她的疑虑。她当时是一名公立学校老师，她知道说服人们支持甚至适度的财政福利，比如她的同事的薪酬。 “给人们钱？我说，我无法缠绕在它周围。“ “你不能只是给人们钱。”</p><p>  But that was before she was diagnosed with colon cancer, before aggressive chemotherapy left her unable to work and unable to pay the rent, before she was evicted from her home in Redwood City, California, and before she moved into an area homeless shelter. It was also before she got the call saying she was being accepted into a program offering six monthly payments of $500 to 15 people experiencing homelessness.</p><p>  但是，在侵略性化疗之前她被诊断出患有结肠癌患者之前，在她在雷德伍德市，加利福尼亚州红木市的家中被驱逐出来之前，在她的家中搬进了一个地区的无家可归者庇护所之前，在她的家中搬到了，之前就是在患有结肠癌患者之前。在她接受呼叫之前，她也被接受到一个计划的计划，提供六个月为每月500美元到15人经历无家可归者。</p><p>  It was December 2020, and she was being invited into a pilot program, run by the  non-profit Miracle Messages, providing guaranteed income—a direct cash transfer with no strings attached. For Softky, it was a lifeline. “For the first time in a long time, I felt like I could … take a deep breath, start saving, and see myself in the future,” she says.</p><p>  这是2020年12月，她被邀请进入试点计划，由非营利性奇迹讯息进行，提供有保证的收入 - 直接现金转移，没有附加条件。对于柔软，这是一个生命线。 “在很长一段时间内第一次，我觉得我可以......深吸一口气，开始拯救，并在将来看待自己，”她说。</p><p>  The idea of “just giving people money” has been in and out of the news since becoming a favored cause for many high-profile Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, including Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, Facebook cofounders Mark Zuckerberg and (separately) Chris Hughes, and Singularity University’s  Peter Diamandis. They proposed a universal basic income as a solution to the job losses and social conflict that would be wrought by automation and artificial intelligence—the very technologies their own companies create.</p><p>  “只是给予人们钱”的想法已经进出了这一消息，因为许多高调硅谷企业家的青睐的原因，包括Twitter的杰克罗西，Facebook Cofounds Mark Zuckerberg和（另外）Chris Hughes和奇点大学Peter Diamandis。他们提出了一个普遍的基本收入，作为对自动化和人工智能造成的失业和社会冲突的解决方案 - 他们自己公司创造的技术非常重要。</p><p>  But while prominent names in technology are still involved today, especially when it comes to funding projects, the conversation has changed. Its center of gravity has shifted away from “universal basic income” aimed at counterbalancing the automation of work and toward “guaranteed income” aimed at addressing economic and racial injustices.</p><p>  但是当今技术中突出的名称仍然涉及，特别是在资助项目方面，谈话发生了变化。它的重心从“普遍基本收入”转移，旨在对与努力的自动化以及旨在解决经济和种族不公正的“保证收入”。</p><p>    First proposed by philosophers in the 16th century, the idea of an income delivered directly by the state has been seen in many quarters as a balm for all kinds of social ills. Progressives argue that a guaranteed minimum income has the potential to lift communities out of poverty. Some conservatives and libertarians, meanwhile, see universal basic income as a cost-effective alternative to existing social welfare systems.</p><p>    哲学家首次提出了16世纪，在许多季度直接发出的收入的想法是各种社会弊病的植物。进步人士认为，保证最低收入有可能将社区占据贫困。与此同时，一些保守派和自由人士将普遍基本收入视为现有社会福利系统的经济效益替代品。</p><p>  In the United States, proponents of guaranteed income as a matter of economic justice have included the Black Panthers and Martin Luther King Jr., while the libertarian economist Milton Friedman advocated it as a form of negative income tax. Even President Richard Nixon proposed providing cash directly to families, without conditions. His plan—produced after 1,000 economists urged it in an open letter—twice passed the House, but got rejected by the Senate.</p><p>  在美国，作为经济正义问题的保证收入的支持者包括黑豹和马丁·路德金，而自由主义经济学家米尔顿弗里德曼主张这是一种负费税的形式。甚至理查德尼克松总统甚至提议直接向家庭提供现金，无条件。在1,000名经济学家后，他的计划制作在一个公开的信中敦促它 - 两次通过了房子，但被参议院拒绝了。 </p><p>  Tech-sector proponents of UBI tend to be driven by the libertarian model. It aligns both with their core beliefs about the future and with their primary theory of change. While it is not a technological solution per se ... it also kind of is. It’s the ultimate hack to get around the complexities of creating equitable social welfare policies.</p><p>UBI的技术领域支持者往往由自由模式推动。它与他们对未来的核心信念保持一致，他们的主要变革理论有。虽然它不是技术解决方案。它也是如此。这是围绕创建公平社会福利政策的复杂性的最终黑客。</p><p>    It’s very much “in keeping with modern Silicon Valley&#39;s excitement for alternative policy experiments and ideas,” says Margaret O’Mara, a professor at the University of Washington who has written extensively on the history of the tech industry. “Like, ‘Okay, the regular systems and institutions aren’t working, and here’s this one cool trick.’”</p><p>    在华盛顿大学教授玛格丽特·奥马拉（Sargeret O'Mara）表示，这是非常沉着的硅谷和梦想的兴奋。 “喜欢，'好的，常规系统和机构不起作用，这是一个很酷的技巧。'”</p><p>  When the concept of UBI began taking hold in Silicon Valley, many proponents looked outside the US for case studies. In 2017, Finland launched a two-year plan giving monthly payments to 2,000 unemployed citizens. In Canada, the government of Ontario announced a three-year program that was cut short when a more conservative party took control of the government. There have also been pilots in Iran, Spain, the Netherlands, and Germany.</p><p>  当UBI的概念开始在硅谷举行时，许多支持者在美国外面看着案例研究。 2017年，芬兰推出了为期两年的计划，每月付款到2,000名失业公民。在加拿大，安大略省政府宣布了一个三年的计划，当一个更加保守的党控制政府时，这是短暂的。伊朗，西班牙，荷兰和德国也有飞行员。</p><p>  But the United States has precedents as well. When Nixon was considering his own guaranteed income plan, studies were carried out in cities including Denver and Seattle.  Since 1982, the  Alaska Permanent Fund has given out a share of the state’s oil revenues to every adult resident (an average of $1,100 each year). A number of Native American tribes pay a share of casino revenues to every registered member. These American systems have shown almost no impact on the rate of employment—people don’t quit their jobs, one of the common concerns voiced by critics—but have led to improved outcomes in education, mental health, and crime.</p><p>  但美国也有先例。当尼克松正在考虑自己的保证收入计划时，在包括丹佛和西雅图的城市进行研究。自1982年以来，阿拉斯加常设基金已向该国的石油收入份额占据各个成人居民（平均每年1,100美元）。许多原住民部落向每位注册成员支付赌场收入的份额。这些美国系统已经表明几乎没有对就业率的影响 - 人们不会辞职，批评者表示的共同问题之一 - 但导致教育，心理健康和犯罪的结果改善了。</p><p>  Even so, there’s something that has felt inherently un-American about UBI. That’s why Softky objected when she first heard it discussed on the radio—“Because I was a good American,” she explains. (The implication being that a  good American wouldn’t take handouts.)</p><p>  即便如此，有些东西有意识到Un-American关于UBI。这就是为什么Socyky反对当她第一次听到它在收音机上讨论 - “因为我是一个好的美国人，”她解释道。 （暗示是一个善良的美国人不会致讲义。）</p><p>    Former presidential hopeful Andrew Yang understood this cognitive barrier of “Americanness” when he proposed UBI as the centerpiece of his 2020 campaign for the Democratic nomination. He knew that what he decided to name his plan to mail monthly $1,000 checks to every American would be crucial to getting a positive reception, and so he workshopped multiple options before landing on “freedom dividend.”</p><p>    前总统希望Andrew Yang在他提出UBI作为2020年民主提名活动的核心时理解这种认知障碍。他知道他决定将他的计划命名为邮寄每月1,000美元支票对每个美国人来说至关重要，以获得积极的接待，因此他在降落之前的“自由股息”之前工作了多种选择。</p><p>  After all, capitalism has become synonymous with the American dream, and what’s more capitalistic than a dividend? And freedom ... well, that part speaks for itself.</p><p>  毕竟，资本主义已成为美国梦的代名词，而且比股息更资本主义吗？和自由......好吧，那部分是为自己说话的。 </p><p>    By the time Yang launched himself onto the presidential debate stage, a number of basic income pilot projects in American cities were starting to generate data.</p><p>当杨发动自己进入总统辩论阶段，美国城市的一些基本收入试点项目开始生成数据。</p><p>  One was the Magnolia Mother’s Trust (MMT), a guaranteed income pilot project in Jackson, Mississippi, that specifically targeted low-income Black mothers. In December 2018, its first cohort of 20 mothers received their first $1,000, and they would receive the same sum every month for a year (they were also given savings accounts for their children). For many, the $12,000 effectively doubled their annual income. The program has since added two more cohorts of 110 women each.</p><p>  一个是玉米兰母亲的信任（MMT），是密西西比州杰克逊的保证收入试点项目，专门针对低收入的黑人母亲。 2018年12月，其第一个20名母亲的队列收到了上一千美元，他们每月收到相同的金额（他们也被储蓄账户为他们的孩子）。对于许多人来说，12,000美元的年收入有效地翻了一番。该方案自增加了两名110名女性的队列。</p><p>    The focus on Black mothers was intentional, says Aisha Nyandoro of Springboard to Opportunity, the nonprofit behind MMT: “When we look at poverty in this country and who has been harmed the most,” she says, “it’s Black women.” The group also chose to start savings accounts for the children to address the fact that  poverty in the US is often generational.</p><p>    黑人母亲的重点是故意的，跳板的艾莎·尼多洛说，非营利组织在MMT之后的非营利组织：“当我们看看这个国家的贫困而谁有伤害最多的时候，”她说，“这是黑人女性。”本集团还选择开始储蓄账户，让孩子们解决美国贫困往往是世代的事实。</p><p>  “So how do we go about ensuring that we are supporting well that population that has been marginalized?” Nyandoro asks.</p><p>  “那么我们如何努力确保我们支持那些被边缘化的人口呢？” nyandoro问道。</p><p>  While the analysis is not complete, early results are promising. Compared with a control group, the pilot participants were 40% less likely to incur debt for emergency expenses and 27% more likely to visit a doctor. On average, they were able to set aside $150 each month for food and household expenses.</p><p>  虽然分析不完整，但早期的结果是有前途的。与对照组相比，试点参与者可能导致紧急费用的债务减少40％，而27％则可能访问医生。平均而言，他们每个月都能留出150美元的食物和家庭费用。</p><p>  But for Nyandoro, these measurable “capitalistic outcomes” were only part of the story. They were important, but so were the dignity and agency that it returned to recipients. “For so many of the families that we work with,” she says, “they have not had someone to say to them, ‘You don’t have to prove that you deserve this. You simply deserve it because you are.’”</p><p>  但对于Nyandoro来说，这些可衡量的“资本主义结果”只是故事的一部分。它们很重要，但它归还给予收件人也是如此。 “对于我们与之合作的许多家庭，”她说：“他们没有有人对他们说，”你不必证明你应该得到这个。你只是值得它，因为你是。“</p><p>  In other words, guaranteed income wasn’t about handouts, but about giving everyone—starting with the most marginalized individuals—a chance at a fair shot.</p><p>  换句话说，保证收入不是关于讲义，而是让每个人开始以最边缘化的人开始 - 在公平射门的机会上。 </p><p>    Giving everybody a fair shot was also the mission of Michael Tubbs, then the newly elected mayor of Stockton, California, when he launched his city’s guaranteed income experiment in February 2019 and became the face of the renewed movement.</p><p>Giving everybody a fair shot was also the mission of Michael Tubbs, then the newly elected mayor of Stockton, California, when he launched his city’s guaranteed income experiment in February 2019 and became the face of the renewed movement.</p><p>  The Stockton Economic Empower Demonstration, or SEED,  gave 125 randomly selected residents $500 a month for 18 months. It garnered plenty of attention—Tubbs and his efforts were even profiled in an  HBO documentary—and drew funding from Chris Hughes’s nonprofit, the Economic Security Project. Results were encouraging. Most of the money went toward fulfilling basic needs.  Food made up the largest spending category (37%), whereas just 1% was spent on alcohol or tobacco (an outcome that opponents had worried about). Meanwhile, rather than dropping out of the workforce, participants found jobs at twice the rate of a control group.</p><p>  斯托克顿经济授权演示或种子，给出了125名随机选择的居民每月500美元，持续18个月。它赢得了大量的注意力，他的努力甚至在一个HBO纪录片 - 并从克里斯·休斯的非营利组织，经济安全项目中汲取了资金。结果令人鼓舞。大多数钱都致力于满足基本需求。食物组成了最大的支出类别（37％），而只有1％的人在酒精或烟草上花了（对手担心的结果）。与此同时，参与者在对照组的速率下占用了劳动力的工作。</p><p>  Buoyed by this success, Tubbs started an organization, Mayors for Guaranteed Income, to expand his city’s pilot. To date, 42 mayors across America have signed on, and additional projects are now being run in towns and cities from  Hudson, New York, and Gary, Indiana, to Compton, California .</p><p>  通过这种成功挥霍，Tubbs开始了一个组织，市长保证收入，扩大他的城市的飞行员。迄今为止，美国跨国公司的42名市长已签署，现在正在携带哈德森，纽约和加里，印第安纳州的城镇和城市的额外项目到加利福尼亚州康普顿。</p><p>  Since the  results of SEED’s first year were released in March, Tubbs has often been asked what he learned from it. “I am tempted to say ‘Nothing,’” he told me in late March.</p><p>  由于种子的第一年的结果于3月份发布，因此Tubbs经常被问到他从中所吸取的内容。 “我很想说'什么，'”他在3月下旬告诉我。</p><p>  He means the pilot didn’t tell him anything that wasn’t already obvious to him: he knew from personal experience that many stereotypes about poor people (especially poor Black people) are not, as he put it, “rooted in reality.”</p><p>  他意味着飞行员没有告诉他任何对他来说都不明显的东西：他从个人经历中知道了许多关于穷人（特别是贫穷的黑人）的刻板印象不是，因为他把它“扎根了”。</p><p>  Tubbs was born in Stockton to a teenage mother and an incarcerated father. He attended Stanford on a need-based scholarship, and returned home after graduation. Soon he was elected to City Council, before becoming mayor when he was just 26.</p><p>  Tubbs出生于斯托克顿到一个十几岁的母亲和一个被淘汰的父亲。他参加了基于需求的奖学金的斯坦福，毕业后回到家。 Soon he was elected to City Council, before becoming mayor when he was just 26.</p><p>  Tubbs didn’t need the data to know he could trust people to make rational financial decisions, but the experience did help him “learn the power of narrative.”</p><p>  Tubbs不需要数据来了解他可以信任人们做理理性的财务决策，但经验确实帮助他“学习叙事的力量”。 </p><p>  He recognized that “sometimes ideology, sometimes racism,” colors people’s perceptions. Part of his job as mayor became to “illustrate what’s real and what’s not,” he says. He saw the chance to “illustrate what’s actually backed by data and what’s backed by bias.”</p><p>他认识到“有时意识形态，有时是种族主义，”色彩的人们的看法。他的工作是市长变得“说明了真实的东西，而不是什么，”他说。他看到机会“说明了数据的实际支持，并通过偏见支持的内容。”</p><p>  The need to change narratives through research and evidence was also apparent to Nyandoro, of Magnolia Mother’s Trust. A few days before the third cohort began receiving money, I asked her what research questions she hoped this new cycle would answer.</p><p>  通过研究和证据改变叙事的需要对玉兰母亲的信任的纽约罗也显而易见。在第三个队列开始收到钱前几天，我问她希望她希望这个新周期的研究问题会回答。</p><p>  “We have more than enough data now to prove that cash works,” she told me. Now her question was not how cash would affect low-income individuals but, rather, “What is the data or talking points that we need to get to the policymakers ... to move their hearts?” What evidence could be sufficient to make guaranteed income a federal-level policy?</p><p>  “我们现在有足够的数据来证明现金工作，”她告诉我。现在她的问题并不是如何影响低收入的人，而是，相反，“我们需要到达政策制定者的数据或谈话点是什么？”有哪些证据足以使保证收入是联邦级政策？</p><p>  As it turned out, what made the difference wasn’t more research but a global pandemic.</p><p>  事实证明，是什么让差异不再研究，而是一个全球大流行。</p><p>    When stay-at-home orders closed many businesses—and destroyed jobs, especially for already vulnerable low-income workers—the chasm of American inequality became harder to ignore. Food lines stretched for miles. Millions of Americans  faced eviction. Students  without internet access at home resorted to sitting in public parking lots to hook into Wi-Fi so they could attend classes online.</p><p>    当留在家庭订单关闭许多企业和销毁的工作时，特别是对于已经脆弱的低收入工人 - 美国不平等的鸿沟变得越来越忽视。食物线伸展英里。数百万美国人面临驱动。在家里没有互联网接入的学生采取了坐在公共停车场钩住Wi-Fi，以便他们可以在线上课。</p><p>  This was all worse for people of color. By February 2021, Black and Hispanic women, who make up only a third of the female labor force,  accounted for nearly half of women’s pandemic job losses. Black men, meanwhile, were unemployed at almost double the rate of other ethnic groups, according to Census data  analyzed by the Pew Research Center.</p><p>  这对色彩的人来说变得更糟。到2021年2月，黑人和西班牙裔女性，占女性劳动力的三分之一，占近一半的女性大流行失业。与PEW研究中心分析的人口普查数据，黑人男子因其他民族的差价几乎失业，几乎是其他民族的速度。</p><p>  All this also changed the conversation about the costs of guaranteed income programs. When the comparison was between basic income and the status quo, they’d been seen as too expensive to be realistic. But in the face of the recession caused by the pandemic, relief packages were suddenly seen as necessary to jump-start the American economy or, at the very least, avoid what Jerome Powell, then chairman of the Federal Reserve, called a  “downward spiral” with “tragic” outcomes.</p><p>  所有这些还改变了关于保证收入计划成本的对话。当比较是基本收入与现状之间时，他们被视为太昂贵，无法逼真。但面对衰退的衰退由大流行引起的，救济包突然被视为必要的跳跃 - 启动美国经济，或者至少避免杰罗姆鲍威尔，然后联邦储备董事长，称为“向下螺旋” “有”悲惨“结果。 </p><p>    “Covid-19 really illustrated all the things that those of us who actually work with, and work for, and are in relationship with, folks who are economically insecure know,” says Tubbs. That is, poverty was not an issue of “the people. It’s with the systems. It&#39;s with the policies.”</p><p>“Covid-19真正说明了我们实际与之合作的所有事情，以及与经济不安全的人的关系，”Tubbs说。也就是说，贫困不是“人民”的问题。它是系统。它与政策＆＃39;</p><p>  Stimulus payments and increased unemployment benefits—that is, direct cash transfers to Americans with no conditions attached—passed with huge public support. And earlier this year, an expanded Child and Dependent Tax Credit (CTC) was introduced that provides up to $3,600 per child, paid in monthly installments, to most American families.</p><p>  刺激支付和增加的失业救济金 - 即直接现金转移给美国人，没有任何条件依附于庞大的公众支持。今年早些时候，介绍了一个扩大的儿童和依赖税收抵免（CTC），为每月分期付款提供高达3,600美元，向大多数美国家庭支付。</p><p>  This new benefit, which is set to last for a year, is available even to families that don’t make enough money to pay income tax; they had been left out of previous versions of the tax credit. And by sending monthly payments of up to $300 per child, rather than a single rebate at the end of the year, it gives families a better chance to plan and budget. It is expected to cut child poverty in half.</p><p>  这种新的好处，即持续一年，即使是没有足够的钱来支付所得税的家庭也可以获得;他们被遗弃了以前的税收抵免。并通过每名儿童的每月付款，而不是在年底的单一回扣，它使家庭有更好的计划和预算。预计将削减儿童贫困。</p><p>  Washington might not have used the language of guaranteed income, but these programs fit the definition.</p><p>  华盛顿可能没有使用保证收入的语言，但这些计划适合定义。</p><p>  The CTC is “a game changer,” says Natalie Foster, a cofounder of the Economic Security Project, which funded many of the guaranteed income pilots, including both SEED and Mayors for Guaranteed Income. It “overturns decades of punitive welfare policies in America,” she says, and sets the stage for more permanent policies.</p><p>  CTC是“游戏更换者”，经济安全项目的联合国联合国纳塔利伊福斯特表示，资助许多保证收入试点，包括养护收入的种子和市长。它“推翻了数十年的美国惩罚性福利政策”，“她说，并为更多永久性政策设定了舞台。</p><p>  Whereas her organization originally thought it might take a decade of data from city-based pilot programs to “inform federal policymaking,” the CTC means that guaranteed income has, at least temporarily, arrived.</p><p>  虽然她的组织最初认为可能需要从城市的试点计划到“告知联邦政策制定”的数据，但CTC意味着至少暂时到达的保证收入。</p><p>  The stimulus bills and CTC also make Tubbs “more bullish now than ever” that guaranteed income could soon become a permanent fixture of federal policy.</p><p>  刺激账单和CTC也使Tubbs“现在比以往任何时候更好”，保证收入可能很快成为联邦政策的永久夹具。 </p><p>  “We live in a time of pandemics,” he says. “It’s not just covid-19. It’s an earthquake next month. It’s wildfires. All these things are happening all the time—not even mentioning automation. We have to have the ability for our folks to build economic resilience.”</p><p>“我们住在一个流行的时间，”他说。 “这不仅仅是Covid-19。这是下个月的地震。这是野火。所有这些事情都在发生一切 - 甚至没有提及自动化。我们必须具备我们的人们构建经济恢复力。“</p><p>    But even if the rhetoric has shifted away from the technocratic concept of UBI, Silicon Valley’s interest in universality hasn’t gone away. Last April, Jack Dorsey announced a new philanthropic initiative,  Start Small LLC, to give away $1 billion.</p><p>    但即使言辞已经从UBI的技术概念转移，硅谷对普遍性的兴趣并没有消失。去年4月，杰克罗西宣布了一项新的慈善计划，开始小型LLC，给予10亿美元。</p><p>  The donations would focus initially on covid-19 relief and then, after the pandemic, shift to universal basic income and girls’ education, he said. Putting money toward these causes, Dorsey  explained, represented “the best long-term solutions to the existential problems facing the world.”</p><p>  他说，捐款最初将在Covid-19救济上专注于Covid-19救济，然后在大流行后转向普遍的基本收入和女童教育。将资金推向这些原因，Dorsey解释说，“世界上存在的存在问题的最佳长期解决方案”。</p><p>  Despite its announced focus on  universal basic income, StartSmall has become one of the largest funders of  guaranteed income. It donated $18 million to Mayors for Guaranteed Income, $15 million to the Open Research Lab (previously known as the Y Combinator basic income experiment), $7 million to Humanity Forward, Andrew Yang’s foundation, and most recently $3.5 million to establish a Cash Transfer Lab at New York University to conduct more research on the issue.</p><p>  尽管它宣布关注普遍基本收入，但Startsmall已成为最大的保证收入的资助。它向市长捐赠了1800万美元的保证收入，为开放研究实验室为1500万美元（以前称为Y Combinator基本收入实验），向人类700万美元，安德鲁杨的基金会，最近350万美元建立现金转让实验室在纽约大学进行更多关于这个问题的研究。</p><p>  Yang, now running for mayor of New York City, has also shifted away from his focus on universality. Rather than sending $1,000 checks every month to everyone, he now advocates for a guaranteed minimum income of $2,000 per year for New Yorkers living in extreme poverty.</p><p>  杨先生为纽约市市长奔跑，也从普遍性的关注转移。而不是每月向每个人发送1000美元的支票，而是现在倡导每年为每年2,000美元的保证最低收入为纽约人居住在极端贫困中。</p><p>  Tubbs claims some credit for these shifts. He recalls a conversation with Dorsey in which he told the billionaire, “It’s gonna take time to get to universality, but it’s urgent that we do guaranteed income… So look, we’re not going to ... test a UBI. We  can test the income guarantee. Let&#39;s start there.”</p><p>  Tubbs向这些班次申请了一些信用。他回忆起与Dorsey的谈话，他告诉亿万富翁，“这将花时间来迎接普遍性，但我们迫切需要保证收入......所以看，我们不打算......测试UBI。我们可以测试收入保证。让＆＃39;开始那里。“</p><p>  If his donations are any indication, Dorsey took Tubbs’s words to heart. What’s still unclear, however, is whether he and other tech leaders see guaranteed income as a stepping-stone to UBI or as an end in itself. (Neither Dorsey nor Start Small staff responded to requests for an interview.)</p><p>  如果他的捐款是任何迹象，Dorsey都将Tubbs的话语带到心里。然而，目前还不清楚，他和其他科技领导人是否将保证收入作为UBI的踏脚石或本身的结尾。 （Dorsey也不开始小型工作人员对面试的要求作出回应。） </p><p>  Scott Santens, one of the earliest  “basic income bros,” believes that the tech sector’s initial interest in UBI as a fix for job loss is still relevant. The pandemic has led to an increase in sales of automation and robots, he says, pointing to reports that inquiries about Amazon’s call center tech have increased, as have purchases of warehouse robots to replace warehouse workers.</p><p>Scott Santens是最早的“基本收入兄弟”之一，认为技术部门对UBI的最初兴趣作为失业损失的修复仍然是相关的。他说，大流行导致自动化和机器人的销售额增加，指出报告亚马逊呼叫中心技术的询问增加，就像购买仓库机器人取代仓库工人一样。</p><p>  Meanwhile, Sam Altman, who helped kick off Y Combinator’s UBI experiment before leaving to head the artificial-intelligence startup  OpenAI, wrote a recent  manifesto about the situation. In it, he urged that we remain focused on the bigger picture: even if the pandemic has caused a short-term shock, it is technology—specifically, artificial intelligence—that will have the greatest impact on employment over time.</p><p>  与此同时，萨姆·奥尔曼（Sam Altman）在离开前往人工智能初创公司之前帮助启动Y Combinator的UBI实验，写了一个关于这种情况的最新宣言。在其中，他敦促我们仍然专注于更大的画面：即使大流行引起短期休克，它就是技术 - 特别是人工智能 - 这将对就业产生最大的影响。</p><p>  Altman called for the UBI to be funded by a 2.5% tax on businesses. “The best way to improve capitalism is to enable everyone to benefit from it directly as an equity owner,“ he wrote.</p><p>  Altman呼吁UBI由2.5％的企业税收资助。 “改善资本主义的最佳方式是使每个人都可以直接受益于它作为股票交窗，”他写道。</p><p>  But would “everyone” include people of color, who are already  being harmed at disproportionate levels by AI’s biases? And could a dividend paid out from the spoils of artificial intelligence make up for that harm? Altman’s manifesto notably leaves out any mention of race.</p><p>  但是，“每个人”会包括颜色的人，他已经被AI的偏见所伤害的水平受到伤害？可以从人工智能的战利弥补这种伤害吗？ Altman的宣言显着留下了任何提及的比赛。</p><p>  When reached for comment, he sent a statement through an OpenAI representative saying, “We must build AI in a way that doesn’t cause more harm to traditionally marginalized communities. In addition to building the technology in an equitable and just way, we must also find a way to share the benefits broadly. These are independently important issues.”</p><p>  当达成评论时，他通过Openai代表发了一份声明，“我们必须以一种不会对传统边缘化社区造成更多伤害的方式建立AI。除了在公平且刚的方式建立技术外，我们还必须找到广泛分享利益的方法。这些是独立的重要问题。“</p><p>  He did not respond to specific requests for comments on how AI was already harming Black communities, and how  Black men are already being erroneously charged with crimes on the basis of faulty facial recognition.</p><p>  他没有回应关于AI如何损害黑人社区的评论的具体要求，以及黑人在错误的面部认可的基础上被错误地指控犯罪。</p><p>  Margaret O’Mara, the technology historian, notes that for technologists, one thing hasn’t changed during the pandemic: the assumption that technological progress is inevitable—and positive. That promotes an attitude of “Let’s figure out how to adjust society around it rather than saying, well, maybe we should try to prevent the displacement in the first place,” she says.</p><p>  Margaret O'Mara，该技术历史学家指出，对于技术人员来说，有一件事在大流行期间没有改变：这一假设技术进步是不可避免的 - 积极的。这促进了一种“让我们弄清楚如何在其周围调整社会而不是说，也许我们应该试图排除排位数，”她说。“ </p><p>  Tubbs, who recently cohosted a Clubhouse session with Altman, has a more generous—and straightforward—view of Silicon Valley’s role in the movement.</p><p>最近与Altman共同联合俱乐部会议的Tubbs，在运动中具有更慷慨，直接的硅谷角色。</p><p>  “I’m happy that they [technologists] are part of the conversation,” he says, because “a lot of revenue will come from them, or come from the products they make.”</p><p>  “我很高兴他们[科技师]是谈话的一部分，”他说，因为“很多收入来自他们，或者来自他们所做的产品。”</p><p>  At the end of the day, after all, it’s largely tech money that allowed him to put  an extra $500 in the hands of his pilot participants every month. “Once that money is given,” he says, what happens next is “up to the person who has the money.”</p><p>  在一天结束时，毕竟，这是一个很大程度上是技术资金，让他每月在他的试点参与者手中额外500美元。 “一旦给予那款钱，”他说，接下来会发生什么是“达到有钱的人”。</p><p>  But what if the harms caused by the tech sector are the reason recipients needed tech largesse in the first place?</p><p>  但如果科技部门造成的危害是接受者首先需要的理由接受者的原因是什么？</p><p>  When Elizabeth Softky became homeless in 2018, she wasn’t alone;  Redwood City&#39;s gentrification at the hands of tech companies and workers was in full swing. Economic forces far beyond her control have shaped her personal ups and downs.</p><p>  当伊丽莎白Softky于2018年开始无家可归时，她并不孤单;红木市＆＃39;科技公司和工人手中的绅士精辟，全面摇摆。远远超出了她控制的经济力量已经塑造了她的个人UPS和下跌。</p><p>    She was grateful, of course, for her six months of guaranteed income—but also aware of the broader challenges that a short-term program run by a small nonprofit could not solve. Softky says she hopes the organization will expand both the amount of money it’s giving out and the duration of the program. But far better would be for the government to do the same.</p><p>    当然，她感激不尽，因为她六个月的保证收入 - 也意识到更广泛的挑战，即小型非营利组织无法解决的短期计划。 Soctky说她希望该组织能够扩展它的发出金额和计划的持续时间。但是，政府也会更好地做到这一点。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/07/1024674/ubi-guaranteed-income-pandemic/">https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/07/1024674/ubi-guaranteed-income-pandemic/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/收入/">#收入</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/killed/">#killed</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
