After all of their stores (at least in the United States) closed at the end of June 2018, the House of Geoffrey seemed destined to join Radio Shack as being little more than a memory for those past a certain age. A relic from the days when people had to leave their house to purchase goods.</p><p>如果有人要求我列出我没想到再次听到的东西，那么“你想去玩具”r“我们？”在顶部位置很漂亮。在2018年6月底之前的所有商店（至少在美国）结束后，杰弗里众议院似乎注定要加入收音机，因为这对过去一定的人来说是一个东西。从人们不得不离开房子购买商品的日子里一无所知。</p><p> But much to my surprise, a friend of mine recently invited me to join him on a trip to the now defunct toy store. His wife’s company purchased one of the buildings for its ideal location near a main highway, and before the scrappers came through to clean everything out, he thought I might like a chance to see what was left. Apparently his wife reported there was still “Computers and stuff” still in the building, and as I’m the member of our friend group who gets called in when tangles of wires and sufficiently blinking LEDs are involved, he thought I’d want to check it out. He wasn’t wrong.</p><p> 但很多时候我的惊喜，我最近邀请了我加入他现在的停滞玩具商店。他妻子的公司在主要高速公路附近购买了一个建筑物，在主要的高速公路附近，并且在扰乱者通过清洁所有东西之前，他认为我可能会有机会看到剩下的东西。显然，他的妻子报告仍然存在“计算机和东西”仍然在建筑物中，并且由于我是我们的朋友集团的成员，当涉及电线和充分闪烁的LED缠绕时，他认为我想一探究竟。他没有错。</p><p> Readers may recall that Toys “R” Us, like Radio Shack before it, had a  massive liquidation sale in the final months of operations. After the inventory was taken care of, there was an auction where the store’s furnishings and equipment were up for grabs. I was told that this location was no different, and yet a good deal of material remained. In some cases there were no bidders, and in others, the people who won the auction never came back to pick the stuff up.</p><p> 读者可能会记得玩具“r”我们，如在它之前的无线电棚，在最终几个月的运营中都有一个巨大的清算销售。库存追求库存后，拍卖商店的家具和设备抢占。我被告知这个位置没有什么不同，但仍然很多材料仍然存在。在某些情况下，没有竞标者，在其他人中，赢得拍卖的人从来没有回来挑选东西。</p><p> So on a rainy Sunday evening in September, armed with flashlight, camera, and curiosity, I entered a Toys “R” Us for last time in my life. I found not only a stark example of what the changing times have done to retail in general, but a very surprising look at what get’s left behind when the money runs out and the employees simply give up.</p><p> 所以在九月的一个下雨的星期天晚上，用手电筒，相机和好奇心武装，我在我的生命中投入了一个玩具“r”我们。我发现不仅仅是一般而言，不仅仅是改变时间零售的常规，而且令人惊讶的是当钱用完时​​留下的东西，而员工只是放弃。</p><p>   Upon first entering the store, I was struck with how much of a wreck the place looked. At this point it had only been closed for around two months, but the lack of regular maintenance combined with the remnants of the store’s chaotic final days were enough to give it a post-apocalyptic look. We were greeted with puddles of water and a collection of half assembled toys which someone abandoned a few feet from the front door.</p><p>   首先在进入商店后，我遇到了多少破坏了这个地方。在这一点上，它只关闭了大约两个月，但缺乏定期维护与商店混乱的最后几天的残余相结合足以给予它后期的表现。我们被水泥迎来了水和一系列半组装玩具，有人从前门放弃了几英尺。</p><p> Once we were able to get the main power back on and light up the store, the first surprise was that the point-of-sale systems appeared to all be intact. On closer inspection, we found that the computers themselves had been removed, but that the displays, scanners, receipt printers, pinpads, and even cash drawers were left in place. As this is the same kind of hardware that I’ve seen at nearly every big box retailer I’ve ever been to, I was surprised that nobody purchased any of it during the auction.</p><p> 一旦我们能够恢复主电源并照亮商店，首先出现惊喜是销售点系统似乎完整。在接近检查时，我们发现计算机本身已被删除，但显示器，扫描仪，收据打印机，PinPads，甚至现金抽屉留在原位。因为这是我在几乎所有我去过的大型大盒式零售商看到的同类硬件，我很惊讶在拍卖期间没有人购买任何东西。</p><p>  Past the registers was a kiosk with a large touch screen computer and printer, after a bit of research, it seems  these were installed in 2011 so customers could print a paper copy of a child’s “Wish List” from the Toys “R” Us website. There’s perhaps a statement to be made here about the people who were still shopping at the store towards the end of it’s run: the customers who would want a printed copy of something that most of us would simply look up on our phones are probably the sort of customer who avoided online shopping as well. Installation of these kiosks were likely seen as playing to the needs of their rapidly shrinking customer base.</p><p>  过去的寄存器是一个具有大型触摸屏计算机和打印机的售货亭，经过一系列的研究，似乎这些是在2011年安装的，因此客户可以从玩具“r”美国网站上打印孩子的“愿望清单”的纸副本。也许是一个陈述在这里仍然在商店购买的人在它的努力结束时进行：那些想要一份印刷副本的客户，我们大多数人只会抬头看我们的手机可能是那种避免在线购物的客户也是如此。这些信息亭的安装可能被视为在快速缩小的客户群中玩耍。 </p><p> The security office was placed, as you might expect, off to the side of the registers. This room was stripped bare and full of assorted trash, which makes sense as the security staff were likely let go before the floor associates. Unlikely anyone was too concerned about stopping shoplifters during a liquidation sale.</p><p>正如您可能预期的那样，将安全办公室放在寄存器的一侧。这个房间被剥离并充满了什锦的垃圾，这是一个有道理的，因为安全员工可能会在地板伙伴前放手。在清算销售期间，不太可能过于担心停止店铺。</p><p> Interestingly enough, the security DVR and monitor were still in place, and when powered back up started cycling through a handful of cameras, nearly all of which seemed to be either broken or knocked ajar during the clean-out. It was certainly a very creepy and unsettling way to preface our journey deeper into the store.</p><p> 有趣的是，安全DVR和监视器仍然到位，当供电后退开始循环通过少数相机，几乎所有这些都似乎在清洁过程中被破坏或击倒了Ajar。这肯定是前加入商店的旅程的一种非常令人毛骨悚然和令人不安的方式。</p><p>  The electronics section looked like it was hit hardest by those looking for hidden treasures in the store’s final days. Some locks were broken to get into drawers, and displays were ripped out of their mounts. Here we found some of the first potentially useful hardware: a number of screens that would play videos about the products they were advertising when you pressed the buttons on them. Apparently there weren’t many hackers present for the final fire sale.</p><p>  电子部分看起来像那些寻找在商店最后几天中隐藏的珍宝的人最难受到最强烈的。一些锁被​​打破以进入抽屉，并且显示器被撕掉了它们的安装。在这里，我们发现了一些第一个潜在的有用硬件：许多屏幕将播放关于他们在其上按下按钮时他们被广告的产品的视频。显然没有多少黑客出席最终的火灾销售。</p><p>   Don’t get too excited, there was no  Goonies-style treasure hidden in the vault, that’s one thing you can be sure nobody forgot to collect on closing day. We did find an incredible number of keys and lock cores laid out, most likely from employees desperately trying to find some key that nobody realized was misplaced until the store was about to get shuttered. Here we also found a full box of documents dealing with the comings and goings of cash from the armored car service. In hindsight, the fact that this was left behind should have been a hint for what was yet to be revealed.</p><p>   不要过于兴奋，没有隐藏在拱顶上的Goonies风格的宝藏，这就是一件事你可以肯定没有人忘记收集闭幕日。我们确实发现了一个令人难以置信的钥匙和锁核，最有可能从员工拼命地试图找到一些没有人意识到的关键，直到商店即将被淘汰。在这里，我们还发现了一整套文件，处理了装甲车服务的现金的录音和事件。在后威尔，这是一个留下的事实应该是一个暗示尚未透露的东西。</p><p>   This area would be a paradise for phone phreaks. Personally I’ve never been terribly interested in telephony gear, but even I was shocked at how much stuff was still here. The Comdial manufactured DXP blade server which apparently ran the store’s phone system on a Motorola 68000 CPU was still up and running, as was a “Messaging and Telephony Server” built by Indyme.</p><p>   这个领域将是手机关键词的天堂。我个人从来没有对电话装备非常感兴趣，但即使我又震惊了到底有多少东西。 COMDIAL制造的DXP刀片服务器显然在摩托罗拉68000 CPU上运行商店的电话系统仍然升级并运行，是由Indyme构建的“消息传递和电话服务器”。</p><p>  Also in this room was the hardware for the internal paging system, volume controls for the various speakers in the ceilings, as well as the Verizon I-211M-L Optical Network Terminal (ONT) that connected the building’s internal systems to the FiOS network.</p><p>  此外，在这个房间是内部寻呼系统的硬件，天花板中各种扬声器的音量控制，以及将建筑物内部系统连接到FIOS网络的verizon I-211M-L光网络终端（ONT）。</p><p>  Now this was more my style. While the servers themselves were gone, there was still plenty of infrastructure left, including some Cisco routers and gigabit switches. There was also a rack where four of their in-house smartphone type devices were charging and ready to go.</p><p>  现在这更像是我的风格。虽然服务器本身已经消失，但仍然存在大量的基础架构，包括一些思科路由器和千兆交换机。还有一个机架，其中四种内部智能手机类型的设备正在充电并准备好。 </p><p>  Taped to the rack was a memo left from Toys “R” Us explaining that the servers must remain on and connected to the Internet until the store’s official “Vacate Day”. It seems that they were wiped remotely, presumably so corporate could account for the destruction of credit card numbers or other personally identifying customer information that was housed on them. They were then either removed physically or perhaps sold during the auction. The memo also indicates a similar fate befell the point-of-sale systems.</p><p>录音到机架是一个备忘录从玩具“r”留下了备忘录，我们解释了服务器必须继续并连接到互联网，直到商店的官方“休假日”。似乎他们被远程擦拭，大概是公司可以解释销毁信用卡号码或其他个人识别所在客户信息的客户信息。然后，它们要么在物理上都被删除或在拍卖期间出售。备忘录还表示类似的命运遭到销售点系统。</p><p>  As an interesting note, the yellow box labeled “ST600” turns out to be a device that can determine  not only how many people have entered the store but also how  large they are. The idea being this would give Toys “R” Us insight on how many adults entered the store with children in tow.</p><p>  作为一个有趣的票据，标记为“ST600”的黄色盒子将成为一个设备，这些设备不仅可以确定有多少人进入商店，还可以确定他们的大大大。这一想法将为您提供“R”我们对拖车中儿童进入商店的洞察。</p><p>  We don’t know what this room actually was, but we decided pretty quickly what we’d refer to it as. While the tech we found throughout the store was interesting, what we found here was actually quite disturbing. This room contained several boxes full of personal information about employees at this particular Toys “R” Us location, down to their medical history and tax forms. As soon as we entered the room, we found a photocopy of one woman’s drivers license and Social Security card laying on the table.</p><p>  我们不知道这个房间实际上是什么，但我们很快就会迅速地指出它的意见。虽然我们在整个商店发现的技术很有趣，但我们在这里发现的实际上非常令人不安。这个房间包含了几个关于员工的员工，这些员工在这个特殊的玩具“r”美国地点，归结为他们的病史和税收形式。我们进入房间后，我们发现一个妇女的驾驶执照和社会安全卡铺设在桌面上的复印件。</p><p>  The amount of personal information left behind for anyone to find was really staggering, especially since these were the company’s own employees. We saw the great lengths the company went to protect customer information, so to see how little regard they had for their own people was honestly infuriating.</p><p>  任何人都留下的个人信息的数量真的很惊人，特别是因为这些是公司自己的员工。我们看到了公司来保护客户信息的伟大长度，从而看看他们对自己的人民的诚实是诚实的愤怒。</p><p> At the time of this writing, there’s still a question of what to do with all of this documentation. My suggestion was to just start a bonfire behind the store and burn it there before even more people run their eyes over it, but reader suggestions are welcome.</p><p> 在这篇文章时，仍然存在与所有这些文档有关的问题。我的建议是刚刚开始在商店后面的篝火，在更多的人跑过它之前烧了它，但欢迎读者建议。</p><p>  We’ll leave the horrifying discoveries of the Records Room behind and conclude our tour with something I thought was perhaps the most surprising find of the whole trip: the Workshop. This area was setup to do maintenance and repairs on products, presumably with a focus on bikes and the like. Considering how many large companies would simply chuck something in the compactor the moment it’s deemed defective, it was sort of endearing to find they at least attempted to provide a repair service.</p><p>  我们将留下恐怖发现记录室后面并结束我们的旅游，我认为全程最令人惊讶的发现：研讨会。该区域是在产品上进行维护和维修的设置，大概是专注于自行车等。考虑到在缺陷的时刻，考虑到简单地将一些大公司夹在压缩机中，发现他们至少尝试提供维修服务是有点可爱的。</p><p>   I’ll admit this was the first time I ever got a close look at the aftermath of a major retailer going belly-up. Perhaps I’m just naive in being shocked that personal information and valuable infrastructure would be left behind when the doors were locked for the very last time. Perhaps it’s standard operating procedure in these cases. But it doesn’t make me feel any better about it.</p><p>   我承认这是我第一次仔细看看一个主要零售商的后果肚子肚子。也许我只是天真地震惊的是，当门上次被锁定时，个人信息和宝贵的基础设施将被留下。也许是在这些情况下的标准操作程序。但它并没有让我对此感觉更好。 </p><p> I wonder how the situation will play out for each of the nearly 800 Toys “R” Us locations which have been shuttered. Was this particular location a fluke? What would have happened if somebody less scrupulous had purchased this building and got a hold of the documentation within? It’s a question that I fear we’ll soon know the answer to as more of these locations hit the open market.</p><p>我想知道如何为近800个玩具“R”的情况发挥出来的情况。 这个特殊的位置是侥幸吗？ 如果在购买这座建筑物并在内部持有文件，那么发生什么？ 这是一个问题，我担心我们很快就会知道更多这些地点达到开放市场的答案。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://hackaday.com/2018/09/17/exploring-an-abandoned-toys-r-us/">https://hackaday.com/2018/09/17/exploring-an-abandoned-toys-r-us/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/玩具/">#玩具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/abandoned/">#abandoned</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/商店/">#商店</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
