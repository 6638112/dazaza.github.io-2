In this chapter, Moss charts the origins and impact of Silicon Beach Software&#39;s seminal game Dark Castle .</p><p>以下是来自Mac Gaming的秘密历史的章节，由Gamasutra贡献者理查德莫斯写的一本新书。在本章中，苔藓绘制了硅海滩软件的起源和影响＆＃39; S Omonomin-Game Bark Castle。</p><p>  Charlie Jackson had a dream to play sport for the United States national team. Which sport didn&#39;t matter too much, so long as he could be on the team. The dream came to him in college, when two of his rowing teammates each made a different United States team — one for the World University Games and the other for the World Championships.</p><p>  Charlie Jackson有一个梦想为美国国家队进行运动。哪项运动没有太多的东西，只要他可以在球队上。梦想在大学里来到他，当他的两个划队队友各自制造了一个不同的美国团队 - 一个用于世界大学游戏，另一个用于世界锦标赛。</p><p>  Jackson was skilled in soccer, athletics, and rowing, but he could see he wasn&#39;t going to attain the level he needed to compete internationally in those. He had to find another sport. The answer came during his four years of active service with the United States Marine Corps. He was a communications officer, but he also took up competitive rifle and pistol shooting. Within a year he was good enough to make the Marine Corps team, which he represented at both regional and national championships.</p><p>  杰克逊擅长足球，田径和划船，但他可以看到他没有参加在那些中竞争所需的水平。他必须找到另一项运动。答案在他与美国海军陆战队的四年积极服务期间出现。他是一名通信官员，但他还占用了竞争的步枪和手枪射击。在一年之内，他足以制作海洋兵团团队，他代表了区域和国家锦标赛。</p><p>  Jackson continued shooting competitively for the Marines after his service. He split his time between running technology-centric businesses and competing on the Marine Corps Reserve team — which he later likened to getting paid to be on the pro golf circuit, as everything he needed during competitions was provided.</p><p>  在他的服务后，杰克逊继续为海军陆战队竞争地竞争。他在运行技术为中心的企业之间分开了他的时间，并在海军陆战队预备队队伍上竞争 - 他后来被比作乘坐职业高尔夫电路，因为提供了在竞争期间所需的一切。</p><p>  The kind of shooting he did in the Marine Corps Reserves was different to the one done internationally at events like the Olympics, however. In order to get good enough to compete internationally in that other style, he knew he&#39;d have to train full-time for a year or two. But to do that he needed more money.</p><p>  然而，他在海军陆战队储备中拍摄的那种射击与奥运会这样的活动不同的人不同。为了获得足够的良好，可以在国际上竞争其他风格，他认识他＆＃39; D必须全职一两年。但要这样做，他需要更多的钱。</p><p>  Come January 1984, when the Macintosh was officially introduced, Jackson was running a computer training business. He taught people how to use their Apple II and IBM-PC machines. He&#39;d been an early adopter of both platforms and had seen how little software was available for them at the beginning. He&#39;d also seen how other early adopters were desperate to buy software for their exciting, expensive new gadget. They&#39;d buy almost anything if it gave them a reason to spend more time using their computer.</p><p>  来到1984年1月，当Macintosh正式引入时，杰克逊正在运营计算机培训业务。他教人们如何使用他们的Apple II和IBM-PC机器。他＆＃39; D一直是两个平台的早期提升者，并且已经看到了一开始就可以为他们提供的软件。他还看到了其他早期采用者如何为其令人兴奋，昂贵的新小工具购买软件。如果它给了他们使用他们的电脑花费更多时间的原因，他们就会购买几乎任何东西。</p><p>  Jackson knew this would happen with the Macintosh, too. A new software company could grow quickly if it could get in early. But he was an entrepreneur. A businessman. He couldn&#39;t write code. In order to find the right people — people excited by the Mac who knew how to program computers — he logged onto an online newsgroup and announced the first San Diego Macintosh User Group meeting. He hosted it in his own house. Thirty-five people crammed into his upstairs office to chat about this revolutionary new personal computer. After the meeting, a man walked up to Jackson and proudly introduced himself. His son, Jonathan, had won a California school science fair award for programming a graphics editor for the Apple II. &#34;Oh, really, you think he&#39;d be interested in programming on a Macintosh?&#34; Jackson asked. He sure would.</p><p>  杰克逊知道这也会发生在Macintosh中。一个新的软件公司可以在早期提前迅速增长。但他是一名企业家。一个商人。他无法写作代码。为了找到合适的人 - 通过了解如何编制计算机的Mac兴奋的人 - 他登录了一个在线新闻组并宣布了第一个圣地亚哥Macintosh用户组会议。他在自己的房子里举办了它。三十五个人挤进楼上的办公室，聊聊这个革命性的新个人电脑。开会结束后，一个男人走到杰克逊，自豪地介绍自己。他的儿子乔纳森赢得了加州学校科学公平奖，用于为Apple II编写图形编辑器。 ＆＃34;哦，真的，你认为他＆＃39; D对Macintosh的编程感兴趣吗？＆＃34;杰克逊问道。他肯定会。 </p><p>  Eric Zocher also stayed back at the end of the meeting. He was a computer science student at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). He&#39;d seen the Lisa and spent a lot of time with minicomputers and mainframes in the university&#39;s computing centre, but Zocher had never owned a personal computer of his own. He&#39;d listened excitedly to the rumors about the Mac back in 1983, and now he was eager to finally try it out.</p><p>Eric Zocher也在会议结束时待在后面。他是加利福尼亚大学圣地亚哥（UCSD）的计算机科学学生。他看到了丽莎，并花了很多时间与大学的小型计算机和大型计算机，但Zocher从未拥有自己的个人电脑。他＆＃39; D兴奋地听取了关于Mac的谣言于1983年，现在他急于尝试出来。</p><p>  Jackson told him about how he wanted to start a software company. &#34;I&#39;m a programmer!&#34; Zocher blurted out. &#34;I want to work with you.&#34; Just like that, Zocher was in.</p><p>  杰克逊告诉他他如何开始一个软件公司。 ＆＃34; i＆＃39; m一个程序员！＆＃34; zocher模糊了。 ＆＃34;我想和你合作。＆＃34;就像那样，zocher正在。</p><p>  They quickly discovered that programming on a Macintosh using the official Apple development tools required a Lisa, which brought an additional cost in the thousands. Not one to be discouraged, Jackson withdrew most of his life savings, bought a Lisa, signed up for the Apple developer program, and founded the company Silicon Beach Software in mid-1984. He then met with seventeen-year-old Jonathan Gay and made a deal. Gay wouldn&#39;t get any money up front, but he&#39;d get royalties on sales of a Macintosh game that he&#39;d program on weekends.</p><p>  他们很快发现使用官方Apple开发工具的Macintosh编程需要一个LISA，这增加了数千美元的额外费用。杰克逊撤回了他的大部分人生储蓄，购买了一个Lisa，为Apple开发人员计划注册，并在1984年中期创建了公司硅海滩软件公司。然后他会见了十七岁的乔纳森同性恋，并达成了交易。同性恋不会得到任何赚心的赚钱，但他＆＃39; D获得了销售的售后服务，以便在周末举办他＆＃39; D程序。</p><p>  Jackson handed over unlimited access to the Lisa without a second thought. He did no due diligence, no programming tests. He trusted that things would work out for the best.</p><p>  杰克逊没有第二次想到的情况下毫无密切地进入丽莎。他没有尽职调查，没有编程测试。他相信事情会造成最好的。</p><p>  Jonathan Gay turned out to be too good a programmer for Charlie Jackson to keep up with. No sooner would he give the teenager a new task than it&#39;d be done. In a matter of weeks their game began to take shape.  A irborne! would be about repelling an onrushing military airborne force. Armed with an anti-aircraft gun and a mortar mounted behind light fortifications, the player needed to move the mouse to angle her shot and destroy the endless waves of tanks and soldiers that parachuted onto the screen, and to shoot down the jets, helicopters, and cargo planes that flew overhead. (Pressing the space bar would switch between the two weapons while Command-S would make anti-aircraft shells steerable with the mouse.)</p><p>  Jonathan Gay原来是Charlie Jackson的程序员来跟上。他不久会把青少年给予新的任务而不是它＃39; D完成。在几周内，他们的比赛开始形成。一个irborne！将是为了排斥一个煽动的军事空中力量。用防空枪和砂浆武装，砂浆安装在轻型防御工事后面，播放器需要将鼠标移动到角度射击并摧毁跳伞到屏幕上的坦克和士兵的无尽波浪，并击落喷气机，直升机，直升机，和飞行开销的货轮。 （按下空格键将在两种武器之间切换，而Command-S会使防空壳与鼠标可操纵。）</p><p>  Before long they started talking about the game&#39;s startup screen. They wanted to have a picture that would capture the mood and spark the player&#39;s imagination. Jackson suggested they have an airborne trooper wearing a beret. The soldier could snap a salute and say &#34;Airborne, sir!&#34; — just like a real trooper would when passing an officer. Jackson had noticed how Apple II games used programmed square waves to make surprisingly sophisticated sounds, even to the point of mimicking a human voice. He hoped the Macintosh could do the same.</p><p>  在长时间他们开始谈论游戏＆＃39; s启动屏幕。他们想拥有一张会捕捉心情并激发玩家的照片和想象力。杰克逊建议他们拥有佩戴贝雷帽的空中士兵。士兵可以抢购致敬和说法＆＃34;飞机，先生！＆＃34; - 就像一名官员一样就像一个真正的士兵。杰克逊已经注意到Apple II Games如何使用编程的方波，使得令人惊讶的复杂声音，甚至到模仿人类的声音。他希望Macintosh可以这样做。</p><p>    Eric Zocher began to investigate. He looked through his  Inside Macintosh manual and found a four-voice synthesizer that would play square waves and simple waveforms. It could make beeps and boops and other sounds just like other home computers of the time. Just like Charlie Jackson wanted. But Zocher had no idea how to figure out what amplitudes and frequencies of square waves could combine to make something sound like an explosion, let alone a voice. He thought he&#39;d try recording some sounds that he&#39;d like to recreate with square waves, then get them onto a minicomputer at the university and look for a way to programmatically approximate the waveforms that correspond to the recorded sounds.</p><p>    Eric Zocher开始调查。他通过他的内部Macintosh手册看，发现一个四个语音合成器，可以播放方波和简单的波形。它可以制作哔哔声和涌货和其他声音，就像其他房间的其他家庭计算机一样。就像查理杰克逊想要的。但Zocher不知道如何弄清楚广场波的幅度和频率可以相结合，以使东西像爆炸一样，更不用说声音。他认为他＆＃39; D试图录制一些他的声音，他喜欢用方形波重建，然后将它们放在大学的小型计算机上，寻找一种以编程方式近似对应于记录声音的波形的方法。 </p><p>  As he researched further, however, he realized the Mac could already play the recorded sounds. It had another built-in sound driver — one that could play sampled digital sounds, one at a time, if you could somehow get the samples onto the Mac. It&#39;s just that nobody had tried.</p><p>然而，当他进一步研究时，他意识到MAC可能已经播放了录制的声音。它有另一个内置的声音驱动程序 - 一个可以播放采样的数字声音，一次一个，如果你可以以某种方式将样品放在Mac上。它＆＃39;只是没有人试过的。</p><p>  Charlie Jackson had been doing graduate study in linguistics at UCSD and had friends in the phonetics lab, where they were using audio digitizing equipment to study the human vocal tract and identify the mechanics of how people speak. The pair took Zocher&#39;s cassette recordings to the lab. Zocher then wrote utility programs to shrink the sampling rate (the number of samples, or snapshots, of audio carried per second) and adjust the bit depth, or audio resolution, from 16 bits to 8 bits. They used a 300 baud modem and an acoustic coupler to transfer the files to the Mac, where Zocher played them using a little program he&#39;d written to tap into the sound driver.</p><p>  Charlie Jackson一直在UCSD的语言学研究生学习，并在语音实验室中有朋友，在那里他们正在使用音频数字化设备来研究人声道，并确定人们如何说话的机制。这对Zocher＆＃39;盒式磁带录制到实验室。然后，Zocher写入实用程序，以缩小采样率（每秒携带的音频的样本或快照），并将比特深度或音频分辨率从16位调整为8位。他们使用了300个波特权调制解调器和声学耦合器来将文件传输到Mac，其中Zocher使用一点程序播放它们，他＆＃39; d写入挖掘声驱动程序。</p><p>  Their jaws dropped. &#34;It was just amazing because no one had ever heard anything like that come out of a computer,&#34; Zocher recalls. &#34;It was a bit tinny with the little Macintosh speaker, but it wasn&#39;t a bad speaker in the Mac. It was so faithful, and we had never heard that before. It was basically digital audio coming out of the Mac. And we were like, &#39;Oh my god, could you do the game this way? Could we do the music and the sound in a game this way?&#39;&#34;</p><p>  他们的下巴掉了下来。 ＆＃34;这只是惊人，因为没有人听过这样的东西，＆＃34; zocher回忆起。 ＆＃34;小型Macintosh扬声器有点静脉，但它不是在Mac中的一个糟糕的扬声器。它是如此忠诚，我们以前从未听过过。它基本上是数字音频出来的。我们就像，＆＃39;哦，我的上帝，你能以这种方式做游戏吗？我们可以以这种方式在游戏中做音乐和声音吗？＆＃39;＆＃34;</p><p>  Zocher put together a simple audio wave editor for his Mac that would allow him to test and refine various sound effects and music. A devoted music fan, he recorded the samples from his collection of 500 vinyl albums. He and Jackson picked records that they believed were out of copyright, such as symphonic recordings from the 1950s and sound effects records from the early 1960s. They whittled down the samples through a process of trial and error — some things sounded bad on the Mac, while others were too long or didn&#39;t match well with the game animation.</p><p>  Zocher将一个简单的音频波编辑器放在一起，为他的Mac允许他测试和改进各种声音效果和音乐。一个忠诚的音乐迷，他从他的500个乙烯基专辑的收藏中记录了样本。他和杰克逊选择了他们认为没有版权的记录，例如20世纪50年代和20世纪60年代初的声音效果记录的交响曲记录。他们通过审判和错误的过程谴责样本 - 有些事情在Mac上听起来很糟糕，而其他事情则太长或者没有与游戏动画相匹配。</p><p>  They had just sixteen kilobytes remaining on the disk for audio after accounting for the rest of the game, which Gay had coded in assembly language for maximum efficiency. All sounds had to be very brief, then, with loops used wherever possible (for example, a helicopter that goes &#34;wop-wop-wop-wop&#34; could have a stored sample that&#39;s just &#34;wop&#34;, and then the game repeats it). They got a dozen sounds into the game this way, and Zocher even figured out a way to play two sounds simultaneously by dynamically mixing them together into one signal.</p><p>  他们在磁盘上留下了十六只千字节，以便在剩下的游戏中进行音频，同性恋者在汇编语言中编码了最大效率。那么，所有的声音都必须非常简短，随时随地使用循环（例如，＆＃34的直升机; WOP-WOP-WOP-WOP-WOP＆＃34;可以有一个存储的样本＆＃39; s just＆＃ 34; WOP＆＃34;然后游戏重复它）。他们通过这种方式在游戏中获得了十几个声音，Zocher甚至认为通过将它们一起混合成一个信号来同时扮演两个声音的方法。</p><p>  There was just one problem. The Mac speakers would pop, loudly, before every sound. But not always. They didn&#39;t have any oscilloscopes, so to figure it out Zocher got Jackson to do some grunt work. Using the wave editor, Jackson would hold the shift key and click to add one byte to the sound file and test it again. Zocher kept track of where the pops occurred and where they didn&#39;t. &#34;I remember him at one point on his calculator,&#34; Jackson says, &#34;he goes, &#39;I got it! The sound buffer has to be full.&#39;&#34; The Macintosh sound generator converted the entire sound buffer, down to the very last byte, into audio, and it did this at set intervals.</p><p>  只有一个问题。在每一声音之前，Mac扬声器会流行。但不总是。他们没有任何示波器，所以要弄清楚Zocher让杰克逊做了一些咕噜声。使用Wave Editor，Jackson将按住Shift键，然后单击以将一个字节添加到声音文件并再次测试。 Zocher一直追踪弹出剧目的地方，他们在哪里＆＃39; t。 ＆＃34;我记得他的计算器的一点，＆＃34;杰克逊说，＆＃34;他去了，＆＃39;我得到它！声音缓冲区必须满满。＆＃39;＆＃34; Macintosh声音发生器将整个声音缓冲区转换为最上个字节，进入音频，并以设定的间隔执行此操作。</p><p>  The Macintosh screen refreshed sixty times a second, and each time a vertical retrace interrupt would run. This interrupt served a very specific and important purpose. It allowed the retrace beam that draws the graphics across the screen, one line at a time from left to right and top to bottom, to return to the top left corner, ready to redraw the graphics. They needed to not only fill the sound buffer completely but also to time their sound buffer updates to synchronize precisely with this beam, or else they&#39;d get audio flickering in the form of popping sounds. Every sixtieth of a second, during the interrupt, his new and improved sound driver would look for the two highest-priority sounds, mix those together, and fill the 370-byte-long sound buffer. It worked a charm.</p><p>  Macintosh屏幕稍微刷新了六十次，每次垂直回撤中断都会运行。这种中断提供了非常具体和重要的目的。它允许回扫描光束在屏幕上绘制图形，从左到右和顶部到底部的一行，返回左上角，准备重新绘制图形。它们不仅需要完全填充声音缓冲区，而且还要在它们的声音缓冲区更新以与此光束精确同步，否则它们＆＃39; D以弹出声音的形式获得音频闪烁。每隔六十一秒，在中断期间，他的新和改进的声音驱动程序会寻找两个最优先的声音，将那些混合在一起，并填充370字节的声音缓冲区。它锻炼了一个魅力。 </p><p>  The first Macworld Expo came up in early 1985, just a few weeks before they finished the game. Strapped for cash, the trio packed all their own gear and folding tables into Jackson&#39;s brother&#39;s beat-up old Volkswagen camper and drove from San Diego to San Francisco to show  Airborne! in a little three-by-three-meter booth space in the basement of the Moscone Center. They hooked the Mac up to Zocher&#39;s huge waist-high stereo speakers and booted  Airborne! for the crowd to play.</p><p>第一个MacWorld Expo于1985年初提出，几周在他们完成比赛之前。 Trio绑架，三重奏将所有自己的装备和折叠桌子包装成杰克逊＆＃39; s兄弟＆＃39; s殴打旧的大众露营者，从圣地亚哥到旧金山开车以展示空中！在Moscone中心的地下室中的一个小三米的展位空间。他们将Mac挂在Zocher＆＃39;巨大的腰部高立体声扬声器上并启动了空中！为了人群玩。</p><p>  As luck would have it, their booth was at the bottom of the ramp coming down to the show floor, so everybody who arrived would hear the  Airborne! sounds and music (the opening few bars of Richard Wagner&#39;s famous composition &#34;Ride of the Valkyries&#34;).</p><p>  好运会有它，他们的展位是在坡道的底部来到展厅，所以到达的每个人都会听到空中！声音和音乐（Richard Wagner的开头少栏＆＃39;着名的构成＆＃34;骑valkyries＆＃34;）。</p><p>  Airborne! drew lots of positive attention and buzz across the three days of the show, including from much of the Macintosh team, who were all curious how the Silicon Beach crew got the sounds to work, and from the independent retailers that scoured the floor for exciting new software and who collectively ordered hundreds of copies for their stores.</p><p>  空降！在节目的三天内制作了许多积极的关注和嗡嗡声，包括从Macintosh团队中的大部分地区，硅海滩船员如何获得声音，以及从独立的零售商那里彻底驾驶地板挑剔地板软件和谁统称为他们的商店数百份副本。</p><p>  Jackson took a third mortgage on his house to pay for mass production of  Airborne! boxes, an advertisement in  Macworld magazine, and shipping to distributors and retailers (which for the first few months happened out of his house).</p><p>  杰克逊在他的房子里拿了第三抵押贷款，支付批量生产的批量生产！盒子，麦克堤杂志的广告，以及运往分销商和零售商的发货（前几个月发生在他的房子里）。</p><p>  Airborne! was successful enough to establish Silicon Beach Software&#39;s reputation on the Mac software scene and to pay for an office plus full-time salaries for a couple of staff. The company soon expanded into productivity software with desk accessory collection Accessory Pak #1 and label printing utility Silicon Press. They also published Bill Appleton&#39;s World Builder game authoring software and one of four games,  Enchanted Scepters, that they planned to use to showcase the World Builder technology. (Sales of  Enchanted Scepters weren&#39;t good enough to justify development of the other three.)</p><p>  空降！成功足以建立硅海滩软件和＃39;在Mac软件场景上的声誉，并支付办公室加上几名工作人员的全职薪水。该公司很快扩展到生产力软件与桌子配件收集配件Pak＃1和标签印刷电法硅压力机。他们还发布了Bill AppleTon＆＃39; S World Builder游戏创作软件和四场比赛中的一个，他们计划用于展示世界建设者技术。 （魔法升度的销售Weren＆＃39; t足以证明其他三个的发展。）</p><p>    For their next in-house game, Jackson wanted to get a real designer involved. He&#39;d done okay on  Airborne!, but he knew that was about the limit of his talents. In any case, the company was in a position where he felt like they should bring in somebody who knows their stuff. Somebody experienced. They could think of just the guy.</p><p>    对于他们的下一个内部游戏，杰克逊希望获得一个真正的设计师。他在空中完成了！，但他知道这是关于他才能的限制。无论如何，公司都在一个位置，他觉得他们应该带入一些了解他们的东西的人。有人经历过。他们可以想到这家伙。</p><p>  Mark Stephen Pierce had entered the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, one of America&#39;s top art schools, when he was fourteen. He was a talented illustrator, but what he really loved to do was play around on a computer he&#39;d found in one of the school&#39;s labs. This computer couldn&#39;t display graphics, so he&#39;d fill the entire screen with one type of text character and then change the characters in certain places to make simple animations. A year or two later, in 1979, the school got a graphics computer called the Z-Box, which used the same chipset as the Bally Astrocade, a home video game console renowned for its impressive graphics capabilities.</p><p>  Mark Stephen Pierce已进入芝加哥艺术学院的学校，其中一名芝加哥之一，当时他十四所以当他十四所以。他是一个有才华横溢的插画家，但他真正喜欢做的是在一台计算机上玩耍，他在其中一个学校找到了。这台电脑可以＆＃39; t显示图形，所以他＆＃39; d用一种类型的文本字符填充整个屏幕，然后更改某些地方的字符以制作简单的动画。一年后，1979年后，学校的图形电脑称为Z-Box，它使用了与Bally Trestocade相同的芯片组，这是一个为其令人印象深刻的图形功能而闻名的家庭视频游戏机。 </p><p>  Pierce loved to draw graphics on the Astrocade. He&#39;d use a program written in Bally BASIC that allowed the trigger on the gun controller to act like a pen, so he could draw by pointing the gun at the TV. That was cool, but the Z-Box was more sophisticated. It had multiple framebuffers, each of which could store a screen-full of graphics, which meant he could quickly flip between them to create animations — just like drawings in a flipbook.</p><p>皮尔斯喜欢在镜头上绘制图形。他＆＃39; d使用在Bally Basic中写的程序允许枪支控制器上的扳机像笔，所以他可以通过指向电视枪来绘制。那很酷，但Z盒更复杂。它有多个帧缓冲器，每个帧缓冲都可以存储一个充满图形的屏幕，这意味着他可以在它们之间快速翻转来创建动画 - 就像在一只触发蓄邮件中的图纸一样。</p><p>  He&#39;d come at night when nobody else was using the machine and work on it until morning. At one point he created an animation of Albert Einstein with his eyes blinking and mouth talking. When the semester finished, the Z-Box&#39;s creator, Tom DeFanti, returned to the school to see what students had created. DeFanti was so impressed by Pierce&#39;s work that he offered him a job.</p><p>  他＆＃39; D晚上来到晚上，没有其他人使用机器并在早上工作。在一个点，他创造了一个艾伯特爱因斯坦的动画，眼睛眨眼和嘴巴说话。当学期完成时，Z-Box＆＃39;汤姆污秽，汤姆污秽，回到学校看看学生创造了什么。 Pierce＆＃39;他为他提供了一份工作，污秽对污秽印象深刻。</p><p>  Pierce was paid $15 an hour to make animations and graphics they could use to impress company investors and attendees at industry events like the Consumer Electronics Show and SIGGRAPH. His creations earned him great acclaim, and a new job. He began working for Dave Nutting Associates, a consulting firm that made coin-operated games for Bally Manufacturing Corporation.</p><p>  Pierce是15小时的15小时，使动画和图形制作，他们可以用来给公司投资者和与会者留下深刻的商业活动，如消费电子表演和​​SigGraph。他的创作赢得了他的好评和一份新工作。他开始为Dave Nuting Associates工作，这是一家咨询公司，该公司为Bally Manufactural Corporation制作了投币游戏。</p><p>  They tasked him with animating the multiple-choice questions on an arcade game called  Professor Pac-Man. While there, he started hanging out with two colleagues, Marc Canter, who he&#39;d met in art school, and Jay Fenton (now Jamie Fenton). Canter was working on audio for the company, while Fenton had designed a popular arcade game called  Gorf. They&#39;d created three tools to help them with their work: one for painting, another for animation, and the other for audio. The Mac was just on the horizon, and they thought it&#39;d be a cool idea to do commercial versions of their tools for that. They quit their jobs and founded MacroMind, where they developed MusicWorks (for audio) and VideoWorks (for animation).</p><p>  他们在称为Pac-Man教授的街机比赛中鼓励他的多项选择问题。在那里，他开始与两个同事，Marc坎特，他＆＃39; D在艺术学校，杰伊芬顿（现在杰米芬顿）。坎特正在为本公司工作，而芬顿设计了一个名为Gorf的受欢迎的街机游戏。他们创建了三个工具来帮助他们工作：一个用于绘画，另一个用于动画，另一个用于音频。 Mac刚刚在地平线上，他们认为它是一个很酷的想法，可以为此进行商业版本。他们辞掉了他们的工作并创立了宏观，在那里他们开发了MusicWorks（用于音频）和VideoWorks（动画）。</p><p>  Pierce loved to play around with VideoWorks. He could draw like a man possessed for twelve hours straight, then somehow have energy to party all night. It was satisfying work, too. He could begin the day with nothing and finish it with an animation of a guy that runs left and right and jumps through a hoop, catches fire, and explodes. Its immediacy was like nothing else. Whereas traditional animation required drawing on paper and taking pictures, then getting film developed and edited, computer animation with a tool like VideoWorks could happen in seconds.</p><p>  皮尔斯喜欢与videoWorks一起玩。他可以像一个拥有十二小时的男人一样绘画，那么以某种方式整晚都能为聚会。它也令人满意。他可以从一天开始，没有任何左右运行的人的动画，并跳过箍，捕捉火灾和爆炸。它的即时性就像别的一样。虽然传统动画需要在纸上绘制并拍照，然后开发和编辑电影，使用像videoWorks这样的工具的计算机动画可能会在几秒钟内发生。</p><p>  MacroMind&#39;s software gained some traction, but by 1986 they were out of money. To keep the company afloat, Canter&#39;s father-in-law made an investment. Not yet aware of how investments and business work, Pierce was outraged that the investment should dilute his own share in the company. He quit in a huff.</p><p>  Macromind＆＃39; S软件获得了一些牵引力，但到了1986年，他们没钱了。保持公司漂浮，坎特＆＃39;岳父的投资。尚未意识到投资和商业工作如何，皮尔斯被愤怒地愤怒，投资应在本公司中稀释自己的份额。他辞职。</p><p>  Zocher had seen Pierce&#39;s sample animations and still images on the disk and in the manual for VideoWorks. He couldn&#39;t believe how good they were. Drawing with a mouse was like drawing with a pack of cigarettes, but Pierce had somehow mastered that most inelegant yet powerful of &#34;brushes&#34;.  Macworld magazines at the time would showcase illustrations done by professional artists with MacPaint, and it was amazing, but Pierce&#39;s work was on another level. Keen to work with the now-independent artist and animator, Charlie Jackson flew Pierce out from Chicago to San Diego to talk about their new game.</p><p>  Zocher看到了Pierce＆＃39; s样本动画和磁盘上的静态图像，并在手册中为VideoWorks。他无法相信他们有多好。用鼠标绘图就像用一包香烟绘图，但皮尔斯有一些掌握了最难以居住的，而且强大的＆＃34;刷子＆＃34; MacWorld杂志当时将展示由宏观的专业艺术家完成的插图，它是惊人的，但Pierce＆＃39;工作在另一个层面上。热衷于与现在独立的艺术家和动画师合作，查理杰克逊飞往芝加哥到圣地亚哥的刺穿，谈论他们的新游戏。 </p><p>  On the drive from the airport to his house, he explained their idea for a platform game. Some guy with modern weapons would walk through a portal at the end of every level and the next world would be totally different. Zocher had got the idea from a short-lived TV show about a family that stumbled through a portal, and a military board game called  TimeTripper, which involved pitting modern soldiers against foes from across the ages — dinosaurs, Roman gladiators, future spacemen, and more.</p><p>在从机场到他家的驾驶，他解释了他们对平台游戏的想法。有些有现代武器的人会在每个水平结束时穿过门户网站，下一个世界将完全不同。 ZOCHER已经从一个短暂的电视节目中获得了关于一个偶然穿过门户网站的家庭的想法，以及一个名为Timetripper的军事棋盘游戏，这些游戏涉及从跨越队的敌人抵御敌人 - 恐龙，罗马角曲者，未来空间，以及更多的。</p><p>    Pierce thought it was stupid and incoherent. Instead, he said, &#34;Here&#39;s what we&#39;re gonna do.&#34; In a fit of sudden creative inspiration, Pierce drew out a storyboard of the whole game, which he called  Dark Castle. It would be a quest against an evil Black Knight who can only be defeated by surviving a series of trials and obtaining a magic shield and the power to hurl fireballs. He told them, piece by piece, approximately how the game would work. The Silicon Beach people in attendance — Eric Zocher, Charlie Jackson, Charlie Jackson&#39;s wife, and Jonathan Gay — had no objection to being talked to that way. Pierce was the expert. If anything, they were impressed. The five of them plus the ten-year-old son of one of Jackson&#39;s friends then spent the rest of the afternoon sitting around a whiteboard, fleshing out the story and brainstorming ideas for the details of specific rooms and weapons.</p><p>    皮尔斯认为这是愚蠢和不连贯的。相反，他说，＆＃34;这里＆＃39;我们会做什么。＆＃34;在突然创造性的灵感方面，皮尔斯汲取了整个游戏的故事板，他叫做黑城堡。这将是一个追求邪恶的黑骑士，谁只能通过幸存一系列审判并获得魔法盾牌和推动火球的力量来击败。他告诉他们，逐个作品，大约是游戏如何工作。 Silicon Beach人参加 -  Eric Zocher，查理杰克逊，查理杰克逊＆＃39; S妻子和乔纳森的同性恋 - 并不反对那种方式谈论。皮尔斯是专家。如果有的话，他们印象深刻。其中五个加上杰克逊＆＃39的十岁的儿子，然后在坐在白板上度过了剩下的时间，巧妙地解决了故事和集思广益，了解特定房间和武器的细节。</p><p>  Pierce flew back to Chicago the next day and started working on the game. He&#39;d draw artwork in SuperPaint — Silicon Beach&#39;s upcoming paint program — and make animations with VideoWorks, then physically mail them on floppy disks to Jonathan Gay. Excited to receive more of Pierce&#39;s artwork, Gay would incorporate these animation and design fragments into the code. Then he&#39;d send back a build of the game for Pierce to try. And so it went on, back and forth for about four months. Initially they&#39;d have to wait a few days each time as the disks traversed the 3,000 kilometers (around 1,800 miles) between San Diego and Chicago by regular mail. But partway through development the Federal Express mail service expanded to include express parcel-tracked shipping between their respective cities. Suddenly they could send floppies across the country overnight.</p><p>  第二天，皮尔斯飞回芝加哥，开始在游戏上工作。他＆＃39; D在SuperPaint  - 硅海滩＆＃39;即即将推出的油漆计划 - 并使用VideoWorks制作动画，然后将它们邮寄给乔纳森同性恋的软盘。很高兴收到更多皮尔斯和＃39;艺术品，同性恋将把这些动画和设计片段融入代码中。然后他＆＃39; d回到刺穿的游戏的建设时尝试。所以它继续前后大约四个月了。最初，他们每次都要等待几天，因为磁盘在圣地亚哥和芝加哥之间穿过3,000公里（约1,800英里），通过普通邮件。但是，通过开发，联邦快递邮件服务扩大到包括其各自城市之间的快递追踪的运费。突然间，他们可以在整个国家派出一夜之间。</p><p>  Their vision for the game was that of a living, interactive animation. The story, itself reminiscent of a Saturday morning cartoon, was serviced by the typical hallmarks of a good cartoon: smooth, sharp, and completely flicker-free animation (thanks to Gay&#39;s assembly code and a documented but unsupported hardware hack); moody and detailed backgrounds; and a clumsy idiot of a hero. The main character, unnamed in the game but dubbed Prince Duncan by the blurb on the back of the box, could run, jump, and throw rocks easily enough, but he was also clumsier than Shaggy from  Scooby Doo. If he could manage to avoid being bitten by a bat, a rat, or a crow, or being taken out by a crossbow arrow or some other baddie, he&#39;d still be liable to die in comical fashion, courtesy of an evil h</p><p>  他们对游戏的愿景是生活，互动动画。这个故事，本身让人想起周六早上的卡通，由一个好卡通的典型标志提供服务：平稳，尖锐，完全闪烁的动画（感谢同性恋＆＃39;汇编代码和一个被记录的但不受支持的硬件黑客） ;喜怒无常的背景;和一个英雄的笨拙的白痴。主角，未命名在游戏中，但被称为邓肯王子在盒子的背面上，可以跑步，跳跃，扔得足够岩石，但他也比斯科夫迪沃毛茸茸的毛茸茸的笨拙。如果他能够设法避免被蝙蝠，老鼠或乌鸦咬伤，或被弩箭或其他一些糟糕的糟糕，他仍然可以以魔法方式死亡，而不是邪恶H</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/315720/The_making_of_Dark_Castle_An_excerpt_from_The_Secret_History_of_Mac_Gaming.php">https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/315720/The_making_of_Dark_Castle_An_excerpt_from_The_Secret_History_of_Mac_Gaming.php</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/城堡/">#城堡</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/dark/">#dark</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/声音/">#声音</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
