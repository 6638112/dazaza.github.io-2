We were having a barbecue in our back garden when gale-force winds started out of nowhere. As we scrambled to hold down plates and glasses, our neighbour’s horse chestnut trees swayed menacingly, their leaves swirling around us.</p><p>那天是劳动节。我们正在后院烧烤，突然不知从哪里刮起了大风。当我们争先恐后地拿着盘子和玻璃杯时，邻居的马栗树威胁性地摇摆着，树叶在我们周围旋转。</p><p> Over the next hour, smoke filled the air and the sky changed from bright blue to dirty grey. We moved everything inside and shut up the house. Soon after, the power went. We had no idea what was happening: rumours started online that protestors – some  said Antifa, some said Proud Boys – were starting fires on the outskirts of the city.</p><p>在接下来的一个小时里，空气中弥漫着浓烟，天空从明亮的蓝色变成了肮脏的灰色。我们把所有东西都搬了进去，把房子关了起来。不久之后，电力中断了。我们不知道发生了什么：网上开始有传言说，抗议者-一些人说安提法，一些人说骄傲的男孩-在城郊纵火。</p><p> We soon learned the truth: a “rare wind event” had caused  wildfires to spread rapidly across Oregon, including to forests south of Portland. As the week progressed, the fires and smoke intensified and people were evacuated from neighbouring towns. Portlanders now had three reasons to wear a mask: coronavirus, police teargas and deadly smoke.</p><p>我们很快了解到了真相：一场“罕见的风事件”导致野火在俄勒冈州迅速蔓延，包括波特兰以南的森林。随着时间的推移，大火和浓烟愈演愈烈，人们从邻近的城镇撤离。波特兰人现在有三个戴口罩的理由：冠状病毒、警察催泪瓦斯和致命的烟雾。</p><p> I refreshed local fire maps every 15 minutes, tracking the flames’ path. My husband and I discussed whether we should plan an escape route but we would have been met by smoke from other wildfires in almost any possible direction. Local government advice was to stay put unless an evacuation warning was issued. We held tight.</p><p>我每15分钟刷新一次当地的火灾地图，追踪火焰的路径。我和丈夫讨论了我们是否应该计划一条逃生路线，但我们会在几乎任何可能的方向上被其他野火冒出的浓烟挡住。当地政府的建议是待在原地不动，除非发出疏散警告。我们紧紧地抱在一起。</p><p>  Climate change was suddenly tangible, and it made our already small pandemic-lives contract further. Within five days,  Portland had the most polluted air in the world, according to the air quality index. Our numbers exceeded the standardised scale. We were told to continue to stay indoors.</p><p>气候变化突然变得有形起来，它使我们本已很小的流行病-生命进一步收缩。根据空气质量指数，在五天内，波特兰的空气污染程度是世界上最高的。我们的人数超过了标准规模。我们被告知继续呆在室内。</p><p> For 10 days, the sun and moon disappeared, bins stood full and uncollected; it felt as if even the grass had stopped growing. My friend said her two usually hyper dogs no longer asked for walks. I wanted  just the pandemic back: putting on a mask when you’re within two metres of another person is better than putting on a mask to open your front door.</p><p>10天来，太阳和月亮都消失了，垃圾桶堆满了，没有人收起来，感觉就连草都停止生长了。我的朋友说，她的两只平时超级棒的狗不再要求散步了。我只想把流行病带回来：当你距离另一个人不到两米的时候戴上口罩比戴上口罩打开前门要好。</p><p> Five years ago, when we dreamed up our relocation from London to Portland, it went something like this: we’d land in the city where my husband’s mother lives, and which we knew to be a liberal, laid-back place, full of quirky, outdoorsy people (the Patagonia sort, not hunting).</p><p>五年前，当我们梦想从伦敦搬到波特兰时，大概是这样的：我们会在我岳母居住的城市降落，我们知道那里是一个自由、悠闲的地方，到处都是古怪的户外活动人士(巴塔哥尼亚人，而不是狩猎)。</p><p> Whenever Portland featured on TV, it was mostly being sent up for its progressive earnestness, aided by the long-running comedy series Portlandia, which skewered the city’s hipster tendencies. But if the worst you could say about a city is that the restaurants know the provenance and name of every chicken they serve, it can’t be too bad. Our plan was to get a campervan and drive up and down the west coast under limitless blue skies. Obama was president and Oregon had just legalised cannabis. Where was the hitch?</p><p>每当波特兰出现在电视上时，它大多是因为其进步的热忱而受到赞扬，这得益于长期播出的喜剧系列片《波特兰迪亚》(Portlandia)，该剧抨击了这座城市的潮人趋势。但是，如果你能说的关于一个城市最糟糕的是，餐馆知道他们供应的每一只鸡的来源和名字，那也不会太糟糕。我们的计划是开一辆露营车，在无边无际的蓝天下在西海岸来回行驶。奥巴马是总统，俄勒冈州刚刚将大麻合法化。问题出在哪里？</p><p> We moved in August 2015, and some of the city lived up to the stereotypes. There were adverts for yoga with goats and yoga with weed. We went to the popular 24-hour Voodoo Doughnut store and tried flavours with names like Dirt and Pothole. But there was a lot I didn’t know about the city – and living in America, too.</p><p>我们在2015年8月搬家，这座城市的一些地方没有辜负人们的刻板印象。有山羊瑜伽和杂草瑜伽的广告。我们去了广受欢迎的24小时营业的巫毒甜甜圈商店，品尝了像Dirt和Pothole这样的口味。但我对这座城市还有很多不了解的地方--我也生活在美国。</p><p>  The first surprise was the lack of non-white people. I later discovered that the 2010 census found Portland to be the whitest big city in the US. When our daughter started daycare, she came home and said she didn’t like her brown skin; she wanted to be white like the other kids. She was three. I felt like a fool for moving her out of a city where she would have been surrounded by people who look like her.</p><p>第一个令人惊讶的是缺乏非白人。后来我发现，2010年的人口普查发现波特兰是美国白人最多的大城市。当我们的女儿开始托儿所的时候，她回到家说她不喜欢她的棕色皮肤；她想和其他孩子一样变成白人。她当时三岁。我觉得自己像个傻瓜，把她搬出了一个城市，在那里她会被长得像她的人包围。</p><p> Living in Portland was also the first time I felt noticed for being in a mixed-race marriage. In rural Oregon, where you now regularly see Trump signs and bumper stickers, it’s become an unsaid agreement between my husband and I that I get out of the car as little as possible. He goes into the gas stations; he checks us into motels. I was horrified but not surprised when, during the fires,  armed vigilantes set up “checkpoints” in small towns – claiming they were worried about “antifa looting”. They stopped drivers and asked them to identify themselves.</p><p>住在波特兰也是我第一次因为身处混血婚姻而受到关注。在俄勒冈州的农村，你现在经常看到特朗普的签名和保险杠贴纸，我和丈夫之间达成了一项默契，即我尽可能少下车。他走进加油站，让我们住进汽车旅馆。在火灾期间，武装义勇军在小城镇设立了“检查站”，声称他们担心“反法抢劫”，这让我感到恐惧，但并不感到惊讶。他们拦住司机，要求他们表明身份。</p><p> I write all of this as a brown person and a recent transplant. Racism for black people in Portland is far more pervasive and damaging. It’s visible in housing policy, police brutality and who gets to work where. In 1859, when Oregon joined the union, it was the only state to explicitly ban all black people living there. That legacy of racism has cast a long shadow. As recently as the 1990s, lenders in the state engaged in redlining (not giving people loans and mortgages because of where they live – which mainly affected the city’s small black population). There continues to be de facto racial segregation in schools. But, until this summer, Portland’s white population didn’t talk about it much.</p><p>我写这一切都是以一个棕色皮肤的人和最近移植的人的身份写的。对于波特兰的黑人来说，种族主义要普遍得多，也更具破坏性。这在住房政策、警察暴行和谁去哪里工作等方面都很明显。1859年，当俄勒冈州加入联邦时，它是唯一一个明确禁止所有黑人居住在那里的州。种族主义的遗产已经投下了长长的阴影。就在20世纪90年代，该州的贷款人还参与了红线计划(因为人们居住的地方而不给他们贷款和抵押-这主要影响到该市的少数黑人人口)。学校中继续存在事实上的种族隔离。但是，直到今年夏天，波特兰的白人人口都很少谈论这件事。</p><p> Then in May, Portland, like many other cities, held nightly  Black Lives Matter protests in response to the killing of  George Floyd. Thousands of people gathered in predominantly peaceful protests, but small groups who damaged property  grabbed headlines and the president’s attention. In July, federal  police were sent in to stop “the riots”, and acting homeland secretary  Chad Wolf described Portland as a “city under siege”. Protesters were snatched off the street by unmarked police cars, teargassed and charged with no warning. Trump described Portland as a “beehive of terrorists,” labelling protesters “professional anarchists” and “people that hate our country”.</p><p>然后在5月份，波特兰和其他许多城市一样，每晚举行黑人生命也是抗议活动，以回应乔治·弗洛伊德被杀一事。数以千计的人聚集在以和平为主的抗议活动中，但破坏财产的小团体占据了新闻头条和总统的注意力。7月，联邦警察被派去制止“骚乱”，代理国土部长查德·沃尔夫将波特兰描述为“被围困的城市”。抗议者被没有标志的警车从街上抢走，他们被催泪弹袭击，并在没有警告的情况下受到指控。特朗普将波特兰描述为“恐怖分子的蜂巢”，给抗议者贴上“职业无政府主义者”和“仇恨我们国家的人”的标签。</p><p> But from my home, that’s not how it looked. The “riots” were confined to a couple of blocks downtown, and the protesters were not threatening Portlanders. We took our seven-year-old to family friendly protests.</p><p>但从我家看，事情不是这样的。“骚乱”仅限于市中心的几个街区，抗议者并没有威胁到波特兰人。我们带着我们7岁的孩子参加了家庭友好的抗议活动。</p><p> Meanwhile, the police were threatening. They shot my husband’s friend in the face with a rubber bullet while he was wearing a press vest. Four mothers I know were gassed on different nights. A neighbour was pulled out of his car and had his leg hit with a baton. The militarisation and lack of accountability – when our taxes support the police to protect us – does not make this a city I feel safe in.</p><p>与此同时，警方也在威胁。他们用橡皮子弹击中了我丈夫的朋友的脸，当时他正穿着新闻背心。我认识的四个母亲在不同的晚上被毒死。一位邻居被从车里拉出来，他的腿被警棍打了一下。军事化和缺乏责任感-当我们的税收支持警察保护我们-并没有让我在这个城市感到安全。</p><p> I was also terrified by the “counter-protesters”. The  Proud Boys, a violent, neo-fascist group, held an armed rally 10 minutes from our house a few Saturdays ago. I incessantly checked Twitter to monitor their movements. In the end, they had a turnout of just a thousand compared to their projected 10,000. Still, I’d be more encouraged by the rally’s failure if the president hadn’t subsequently told them to “stand by” during the first presidential debate.</p><p>我也被“反抗议者”吓坏了。骄傲的男孩，一个暴力的新法西斯主义团体，几个星期六前在离我们家10分钟路程的地方举行了一次武装集会。我不停地查看推特，监视他们的动向。最终，他们的投票率只有1000人，而不是他们预计的1万人。不过，如果总统随后没有在第一场总统辩论中告诉他们“待命”，我会对集会的失败感到更受鼓舞。</p><p> Portland came up numerous times in that debate, never for its artsy quaintness. The moderator quizzed Joe Biden on how he would handle the city’s “riots”. President Trump pointed to it as an example of a radical left-run city in need of “law and order”.</p><p>波特兰在那次辩论中无数次被提及，从来没有因为它的艺术奇特。主持人询问乔·拜登将如何处理这座城市的“骚乱”。特朗普总统指出，这是一个激进的左翼城市需要“法律和秩序”的一个例子。</p><p>  When Trump first came to power, I naively hoped he’d be too lazy, too narcissistic to put into effect policies that would really dismantle the country. But the assaults on immigration and healthcare were swift. Then, in 2018, our daughter’s first year in school, a student at a Florida school shot and  killed 17 of his classmates. The scale of the massacre and the president’s further embrace of the National Rifle Association were impossible to understand. On a personal level, having our five-year-old come home and tell us she hid in a cupboard during an active shooter drill was a punch to the gut.</p><p>特朗普第一次上台时，我天真地希望他太懒、太自恋，不会实施真正瓦解国家的政策。但对移民和医疗保健的攻击是迅速的。然后，在2018年，也就是我们女儿上学的第一年，佛罗里达州一所学校的一名学生开枪打死了他的17名同学。大屠杀的规模和总统对全国步枪协会的进一步拥护是不可能理解的。在个人层面上，让我们五岁的孩子回家告诉我们，她在一次积极的射击训练中藏在橱柜里，这是对她的一记打击。</p><p> Another day she came home and said, “This kid said that the president  puts kids in cages but that’s not true, right?” A feeling was growing inside of me that, yes, it was our choice to be here – but did we have to stay? When Trump talked on the TV or radio, she started asking to turn it off. The hidden anxieties of living in the US were mounting.</p><p>另一天，她回到家说，“这个孩子说总统把孩子关进笼子里，但这不是真的，对吗？”我心里越来越有一种感觉，是的，这是我们选择留在这里--但我们一定要留下来吗？当特朗普在电视或收音机上讲话时，她开始要求关掉它。生活在美国的隐秘焦虑正在加剧。</p><p> Because my husband and I were both freelance, we had to take out a health insurance policy. Through Obamacare, we paid $750 a month. This covered seeing our GP, but not emergency room visits; policy coverage differs wildly and is dizzying to navigate.</p><p>因为我丈夫和我都是自由职业者，我们不得不买了一份健康保险单。通过奥巴马医改，我们每月支付750美元。这包括看我们的全科医生，但不包括急诊室就诊；保单覆盖范围差异很大，导航起来令人眼花缭乱。</p><p> One Saturday evening, our daughter came up in hives. At the hospital, they took our insurance details, recorded her vitals, gave her some antihistamine and a remote control, and she lay in bed and watched Frozen. She was fine and we were relieved. As we were leaving, the doctor brought out paperwork and I asked how much it would cost; she blinked and said our insurance company would be in touch. A week later, we got a bill for $600. I had to reprogramme my British mindset; we learned to avoid the emergency room.</p><p>一个星期六的晚上，我们的女儿出现在荨麻疹中。在医院，他们拿走了我们的保险资料，记录了她的生命体征，给了她一些抗组胺药和一个遥控器，然后她躺在床上看了“冰雪奇缘”。她很好，我们松了一口气。当我们离开的时候，医生拿出了文件，我问要多少钱；她眨了眨眼睛，说我们的保险公司会联系我们的。一周后，我们收到了一张600美元的账单。我不得不重新规划我的英国心态；我们学会了避开急诊室。</p><p> In May, I looked on in envy as the UK expressed outrage at Dominic Cummings’ covert Durham trip, while the US government had failed to muster any kind of national response. Politicians didn’t have to hide cross-country trips. Trump was proudly appearing on TV to reject the science. I watched the UK’s first curve drop as the US’s continued to rise. The question grew bigger: do we still need to be here?</p><p>今年5月，我羡慕地看着英国对多米尼克·卡明斯(Dominic Cummings)秘密访问达勒姆表示愤怒，而美国政府未能在全国范围内做出任何回应。政客们不必隐瞒越野旅行。特朗普自豪地出现在电视上拒绝这项科学。我看到了英国的第一次曲线下降，而美国的曲线继续上升。问题变得更大了：我们还需要留在这里吗？</p><p> Portland’s local government took matters into its own hands and locked down with little resistance. Rates of Covid-19 infection have remained relatively low. The city’s lack of density, too, has felt comforting. Yet the sadness mounts when you’re watching a preventable nationwide death toll rise beyond 200,000, with millions losing their jobs.</p><p>波特兰当地政府将事情掌握在自己手中，几乎没有抵抗。新冠肺炎感染率一直保持在较低水平。这座城市的人口密度也很低，这也让人感到安慰。然而，当你看到全国范围内可预防的死亡人数超过20万人，数百万人失去工作时，悲哀与日俱增。</p><p> It was after a postcard-perfect, reception-free camping trip this August that my husband and I started to talk in earnest about returning to London. Driving back from Oregon’s fir-lined lakes and mountains with a kayak strapped to our roof, I became consumed by the anxiety of living in a US city in 2020.</p><p>今年8月，在经历了一次明信片般的完美、免接待的露营之旅后，我和丈夫开始认真讨论返回伦敦的事宜。从俄勒冈州冷杉林立的湖泊和山脉开车回来，屋顶上绑着一艘皮划艇，我被2020年生活在美国城市的焦虑所吞噬。</p><p> On a micro scale, we’ve made a happy life. What I love most about living in America is the feeling of possibility. Get in your car and you can drive for days through deserts, ghost towns, canyons, glaciers. We’ve spotted brown bears and bald eagles, driven around tornadoes, spent eight straight hours gripped to the wheel on icy snow. And in general, I find people less judgmental and cynical than in the UK.</p><p>从微观上说，我们已经过上了幸福的生活。我最喜欢生活在美国的是一种可能性的感觉。坐上你的车，你可以在沙漠、鬼城、峡谷和冰川上开上几天的车。我们发现了棕熊和秃鹰，它们在龙卷风中飞来飞去，在冰雪中连续八个小时紧紧抓住方向盘。总体而言，我发现人们没有英国人那么挑剔和愤世嫉俗。</p><p>  But as we emerged back into phone reception, I saw my best friend Maggie had posted a selfie in a helmet, goggles and mask. She’d been at a Black Lives Matter protest when, without warning, the police had teargassed her and other protesters. “I couldn’t breathe, it felt like glass entering my lungs, I vomited,” she wrote. On the rest of the drive home, my husband and I talked through what it would mean to pack up and start life again in London .</p><p>但当我们回到电话接待处时，我看到我最好的朋友玛吉上传了一张戴着头盔、护目镜和口罩的自拍。她参加了“黑人生命也是命”抗议活动，警察在没有任何警告的情况下对她和其他抗议者进行催泪。她写道：“我无法呼吸，感觉就像玻璃进入我的肺部，我呕吐了。”在剩下的开车回家的路上，我和丈夫讨论了收拾行装，在伦敦重新开始生活意味着什么。</p><p> I know how lucky we are to have options: everyone I know wants an escape plan. But I feel sad thinking about it. I feel cowardly not to stay and fight. Many Portlanders are organising furiously for change, and the city’s demographics also seem to be shifting.</p><p>我知道我们有选择是多么幸运：我认识的每个人都想要一个逃跑计划。但是我一想到这件事就感到难过。我觉得不留下来战斗是懦弱的。许多波特兰人正在为变革而疯狂地组织起来，这座城市的人口结构似乎也在发生变化。</p><p> I decided I needed to leave over the election period. The paralysing fear of the unknown outcome became too much, in a country I can’t even vote in. I am in London now, quarantining in my old bedroom in my parents’ attic. I usually regress to teenage ways when I stay here, but this time I feel I am unfurling. We’re spending our days doing online school, and for the first time since the pandemic began, I’m able to give over enough of my brain to help my daughter learn.</p><p>我决定在选举期间离开。在一个我甚至不能投票的国家，对未知结果的恐惧变得令人麻木。我现在在伦敦，隔离在我父母阁楼上的旧卧室里。当我呆在这里的时候，我通常会退回到十几岁的方式，但这次我感觉到了我的展开。我们每天都在网上学习，自从大流行开始以来，我第一次能够腾出足够的大脑来帮助我的女儿学习。</p><p> Of course, the UK has its own problems, too. But I am physically and mentally relieved to be distanced from white supremacists carrying guns on the streets, the threat of pandemic-related medical debt, and the specific cruelty of the Trump administration. We have a return ticket booked; we just have to decide if we’ll use it.</p><p>当然，英国也有自己的问题。但与街上持枪的白人至上主义者、与大流行相关的医疗债务威胁以及特朗普政府的具体残忍保持距离，让我在身体和精神上都松了一口气。我们订了一张回程机票，我们只要决定是否要用它就行了。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/31/we-left-the-uk-for-portland-expecting-a-liberal-dream-that-wasnt-the-reality">https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/31/we-left-the-uk-for-portland-expecting-a-liberal-dream-that-wasnt-the-reality</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/英国/">#英国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/uk/">#uk</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/波特兰/">#波特兰</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
