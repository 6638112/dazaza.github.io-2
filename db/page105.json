People like to browse but rarely convert and most of these transactions happen offline. So real-estate clients don\u2019t know how to optimize for their real buyers. Tomi uses machine learning to analyze the way real buyers browse the website and optimize ad campaigns towards conversions.\u201d\n The background to all this is that with Apple closing down IDFA, Google planning to remove third-party cookies from its Chrome browser, and the latest iOS 14.5 update allowing users opt out of \u201cpersonalized ads\u201d, the entire ad business is in flux, so new tools are going to be required.

But sometimes it is necessary to protect the superfluous in order to preserve the necessary,&#34; Breyer wrote.\n   Breyer said that the court has made clear that students &#34;do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression even &#39;at the school house gate.&#39;&#34;\n  &#34;But,&#34; he said, &#34;we have also made clear that courts must apply the First Amendment in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.&#34;\n &#34;The school itself has an interest in protecting a student&#39;s unpopular expression, especially when the expression takes place off campus. America&#39;s public schools are the nurseries of democracy,&#34; the opinion read.\n  &#34;F--k school f--k softball f--k cheer f--k everything&#34; Brandi Levy, then 14, wrote in 2017. She was reacting to the fact that as a junior varsity cheerleader she had failed to get a spot on the varsity squad at Mahanoy Area High School in Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania.\n When school officials learned of the outburst, Levy was suspended from the JV team for having violated school rules. But her lawyers sued, alleging the school had violated her freedom of speech. Levy is now 18 and a freshman at Bloomsburg University.\n Levy lauded the justices&#39; decision on Wednesday, saying in a statement: &#34;The school went too far, and I&#39;m glad that the Supreme Court agrees.&#34;\n &#34;Young people need to have the ability to express themselves without worrying about being punished when they get to school,&#34; she said. &#34;I never could have imagined that one simple snap would turn into a Supreme Court case, but I&#39;m proud that my family and I advocated for the rights of millions of public school students.&#34;\n  Justice Clarence Thomas dissented, writing that students like the former cheerleader &#34;who are active in extracurricular programs have a greater potential, by virtue of their participation, to harm those programs.&#34;\n &#34;For example, a profanity-laced screed delivered on social media or at the mall has a much different effect on a football program when done by a regular student than when done by the captain of the football team. So, too, here,&#34; Thomas wrote.\n  Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said Wednesday&#39;s ruling is a &#34;rare win&#34; for students in speech cases at the Supreme Court.\n  &#34;Today&#39;s decision may seem obvious to those who have a hard time seeing why public schools should be able to regulate any and all off-campus speech by students, but the fact that the court is identifying circumstances in which they can&#39;t is actually a big deal,&#34; Vladeck said.\n &#34;Although the line between the off-campus speech that schools can and can&#39;t regulate is less than clear, the fact that there is a line will have significant ramifications for just about all public school administrators going forward. It&#39;s a rare win for a student in a speech case before the current court,&#34; he added.\n At oral arguments, several of the justices struggled with where they could draw the line if they allowed schools to discipline students for speech directed at the school that occurs off-campus.\n Breyer, for example, acknowledged that Levy used &#34;unattractive swear words,&#34; but he questioned whether it caused a &#34;material and substantial disruption&#34; to the school.\n &#34;I don&#39;t see much evidence it did,&#34; he said, noting that teenagers, when talking to each other, often swear when they are off-campus.\n &#34;I mean, my goodness, every school in the country would be doing nothing but punishing,&#34; Breyer said.\n David Cole, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer for Levy, said that his client was &#34;merely expressing frustration with a four-letter word to her friends outside of school on a weekend.&#34; She wasn&#39;t sending a threat or an attempt to bully another student.\n &#34;The message may seem trivial, but for young people, the ability to voice their emotions to friends without fear of school censorship may be the most important freedom of all,&#34; he said.\n Lisa Blatt, a lawyer for the Mahanoy Area School District, told the justices that the line should be drawn not based on where the speech occurred, but on whether it caused a substantial disruption to the school.\n &#34;Off-campus speech, particularly on social media can be disruptive,&#34; she said, because of the internet&#39;s &#34;ubiquity, instantaneous and mass dissemination.&#34;\n Levy&#39;s case drew the support of Mary Beth and John Tinker, who won a landmark school speech case in 1969 that allowed them to wear a black armband on campus to protest the Vietnam War.\n  The high court held then that students do not shed &#34;their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate,&#34; but said that some speech on school grounds could be could be punished.\n The justices took into consideration the special characteristics of a school environment and said that public school officials could regulate speech that would &#34;materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school.&#34; The opinion, however, dealt only with speech on school grounds related to the school.\n Levy won in the lower courts. A district court found that the school had not shown that she waived her speech rights as a condition of joining the cheerleading team. A federal appeals court affirmed, relying on the fact that the speech hadn&#39;t occurred in the campus environment which would include school-sponsored events and field trips.\n Breyer disagreed with the reasoning of a lower court opinion that held that a school could never regulate speech that takes place off campus, but at the same time he declined to set forth what he called &#34;a broad, highly general First Amendment rules stating just what counts as &#39;off-campus speech.&#34;\n Instead, he allowed that while the cheerleader&#39;s post were &#34;crude&#34; they &#34;did not amount to fighting words.&#34; He said that while she used &#34;vulgarity&#34; her speech was not &#34;obscene.&#34;\n   In addition, her post appeared &#34;outside of school hours from a location outside of school&#34; and they did not target any member of the school community with &#34;abusive&#34; language. He added that she used her own personal cellphone and her audience consisted of a private circle of Snapchat friends. Breyer said &#34;these features of her speech&#34; diminish the school&#39;s interest in punishing her.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 06:56:08", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662,court,\u5b66\u6821", "title": "\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4e2d\u5566\u5566\u961f\u961f\u5728\u7ebf\u8bc5\u5492 ", "title_en": "Supreme Court Sides With High School Cheerleader Who Cursed Online", "transed": 1, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/23/politics/supreme-court-first-amendment-cheerleader/index.html?ofs=fbia", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662", "court", "\u5b66\u6821"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "8685b44ace3aad0821baa41bced41edd.jpg", "infoid": 1067858, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7ebd\u7ea6\uff08CNN Business\uff09\u8d2d\u7269\u8005Aren\uff06\uff0339;\u867d\u7136\u6709\u4e9b\u5356\u5bb6\u6240\u8bf4\uff0c\u5728\u4eca\u5e74\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u8428\u9ed8\u65af\u00b7\u8428\u6602\uff06\uff0339; T\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u538c\u5026\u4e86\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u7d20\u6570\u7684\u8ff9\u8c61\u3002\n \u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\uff08AMZN\uff09\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u661f\u671f\u4e00\u548c\u5468\u4e8c\u4e3e\u884c\u7684\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9f0e\u76db\u7684\u65e5\u5b50\uff0c\u662f\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u5356\u5bb6\u9500\u552e\u671f\u6700\u5927\u7684\u9500\u552e\u671f\uff06\uff0339;\u5386\u53f2\u3002\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6765\u81ea\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u5546\u4eba\u7684\u9500\u552e\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u9500\u552e\u989d\u3002\n \u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u8fd8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u6210\u5458\u5728\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8d2d\u4e70\u8d85\u8fc72.5\u4ebf\u7269\u54c1\u3002\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u771f\u7a7a\uff0c\u5496\u5561\u58f6\u548c\u5d74\u53f7\u7801\u662f\u4e00\u4e9b\u6700\u7545\u9500\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u3002\n     \uff06\uff0334;\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\uff06\uff0339; ampime\u65e5\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u65b0\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6210\u5458\u6ce8\u518c\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5f3a\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6210\u5458\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53d1\u5c55\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u76f8\u4fe1\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\u4f7f\u547d\uff0c\uff06\uff0334; Telsey\u54a8\u8be2\u5c0f\u7ec4\u7684\u96f6\u552e\u5206\u6790\u5e08Joseph Feldman\u5728\u4e00\u540d\u7814\u7a76\u7968\u636e\u5468\u4e09\u8868\u793a\u3002\n    \u6bd4\u5c14\u5fb7\u66fc\u8bf4\uff0c\u4eca\u5e74\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u5229\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5176\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u79c1\u4eba\u6807\u7b7e\u54c1\u724c\u548c\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4f4d\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\n  \u6c83\u5c14\u739b\uff08WMT\uff09\uff0cTarget\uff08TGT\uff09\uff0cCostco\uff08\u6210\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u8d2d\u4e70\uff08BBY\uff09\uff0cMacy\uff06\uff0339; s\uff08m\uff09\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\uff0c\u4ee5\u8d44\u672c\u5316\u5728\u7ebf\u65e5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u901a\u7684\u6fc0\u589e\u3002\n   \u603b\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u5929\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u671f\u95f4\u5728\u7ebf\u652f\u51fa\u8d85\u8fc7110\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4e0e\u53bb\u5e74\u76f8\u6bd4\u589e\u957f\u4e866.1\uff05\uff06\uff0339;\u636eAdobe Analytics\u79f0\uff0c\u8ffd\u6eaf\u5230\u7f8e\u56fd\u96f6\u552e\u7f51\u7ad9\u8d85\u8fc71\u4e07\u4ebf\u8bbf\u95ee18\u4e2a\u4ea7\u54c1\u7c7b\u522b\u7684100\u4e07\u9879\u3002 \n\uff06\uff0334;\u5149\u73af\u6548\u5e94\uff06\uff0334; \u7d20\u6570\u65e5\u7ed9\u51fa\uff06\uff0334;\u5927\u578b\u548c\u5c0f\u578b\u5728\u7ebf\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u90fd\u5927\u91cf\u6536\u5165\u5347\u964d\u673a\uff0c\uff06\uff0334; Taylor Schreiner\u8bf4\uff0cAdobe\uff06\uff0339;\u6570\u5b57\u89c1\u89e3\u5bfc\u6f14\u3002 ", "note_en": "New York (CNN Business)Shoppers aren&#39;t showing any signs of getting tired of  Amazon Prime Day, even though  some sellers had said they weren&#39;t planning on offering deals this year.\n Amazon  (  AMZN) said that Prime Day, held this past Monday and Tuesday, was the biggest two-day sales period for third-party sellers in the company&#39;s history. Amazon said sales from third-party merchants outpaced its own sales.\n Amazon also said Prime members purchased more than 250 million items worldwide on Prime Day. Robotic vacuums, coffee makers and Crest Whitestrips were some of the top-selling products.\n     &#34;Amazon&#39;s Prime Day was aimed to boost new Prime member signups and enhance its relationship with existing members to grow the ecosystem, a mission we believe Amazon accomplished,&#34; Joseph Feldman, a retail analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, said in a research note Wednesday.\n    Amazon benefited this year from a favorable  economic environment, a wider product assortment \u2014 particularly in its own private-label brands\u2014 and increased participation from third-party sellers, said Feldman.\n  Walmart  (  WMT),  Target  (  TGT),  Costco  (  COST),  Best Buy  (  BBY),  Macy&#39;s  (  M) and others offered up deals of their own to capitalize on the surge in online traffic driven by Prime Day.\n   Overall, online spending during the two-day event surpassed $11 billion, a 6.1% increase compared to last year&#39;s Prime Day held in October, according to Adobe Analytics, which tracks more than 1 trillion visits to US retail sites and over 100 million items across 18 product categories.\n The &#34;halo effect&#34;

It\u2019s used for things like spam detection in emails, sentiment analysis for social media posts, or intent detection in chat bots.\n In this series I am going to compare several libraries that can be used to train text classification models.\n  fastText is a tool from Facebook made specifically for efficient text classification. It\u2019s written in C++ and optimized for multi-core training, so it\u2019s very fast, being able to process hundreds of thousands of words per second per core. It\u2019s very straightforward to use, either as a Python library or through a CLI tool.\n Despite using an older machine learning model (a neural network architecture from 2016), fastText is still very competitive and provides an excellent baseline. If you also take into account resource usage, it will be all but impossible to improve on the fastText results, considering that the only models that perform better require powerful GPUs.\n  fastText requires the training data for text classification to be in a special format: each document should be on a single line and the labels should be at the start of the line, with the prefix  __label__, like this:\n  __label__sauce __label__cheese How much does potato starch affect a cheese sauce recipe? __label__food-safety __label__acidity Dangerous pathogens capable of growing in acidic environments __label__cast-iron __label__stove How do I cover up the white spots on my cast iron stove?\n If you use Doccano for  annotating the text data, it has an option to export the data in fastText format. But even if you used another tool for annotation, it\u2019s only a couple of lines of Python code to convert to the appropriate format. Let\u2019s say we have our data in a  JSONL format, with each JSON object having a  labels key and a  text key. To convert to fastText format, we can use the following short snippet:\n   After you have the data in the right format, the simplest way to use fastText is through it\u2019s CLI tool. After you  installed it, you can train a model with the  supervised subcommand:\n &gt; ./fasttext supervised -input fasttext.txt -output modelRead 0M wordsNumber of words: 16568Number of labels: 736Progress: 100.0% words/sec/thread: 47065 lr: 0.000000 avg.loss: 10.027837 ETA: 0h 0m 0s\n You can evaluate the model on a separate dataset with the  test subcommand and you will get the precision and recall for the first candidate label:\n   &gt; ./fasttext predict model.bin -How to make lasagna?__label__bakingBest way to chop meat__label__food-safetyHow to store steak__label__food-safety\n fastText comes with a builtin hyperparameter optimizer, to find the best model on a validation dataset, within the given time (5 minutes by default):\n    A precision of 0.72, compared to 0.16 before. Not bad, for 10 minutes of our time, out of which 5 was waiting for the computer to find us a better model.\n  This library provides a couple of knobs you can use to try to obtain better models, from what kind of n-grams to use, how big the learning rate should be, what should be the loss function, but also what metric are you trying to optimize. Is precision or recall better aligned with your business KPIs? Is it more important to have the top result be a really good one or are you looking for several good results among in the top 5? Are you only interested in high confidence results? All this depends on the problem you are trying to solve and fastText provides ways to optimize for each of those.\n   Not much flexibility \u2013 only one neural network architecture from 2016 implemented with very few parameters to tune\n  fastText is a great library to use when you want to start solving a text classification problem. In less than half an hour, you can get a good baseline going, which will tell you if this is a problem that is worth pursuing or not.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 06:54:55", "source_domain":

", "note_en": "For years, Rudy North woke up at 9  . . and read the Las Vegas  Review-Journal while eating a piece of toast. Then he read a novel\u2014he liked James Patterson and Clive Cussler\u2014or, if he was feeling more ambitious, Freud. On scraps of paper and legal notepads, he jotted down thoughts sparked by his reading. \u201cDeep below the rational part of our brain is an underground ocean where strange things swim,\u201d he wrote on one notepad. On another, \u201cLife: the longer it cooks, the better it tastes.\u201d\n Rennie, his wife of fifty-seven years, was slower to rise. She was recovering from lymphoma and suffered from neuropathy so severe that her legs felt like sausages. Each morning, she spent nearly an hour in the bathroom applying makeup and lotions, the same brands she\u2019d used for forty years. She always emerged wearing pale-pink lipstick. Rudy, who was prone to grandiosity, liked to refer to her as \u201cmy amour.\u201d\n On the Friday before Labor Day, 2013, the Norths had just finished their toast when a nurse, who visited five times a week to help Rennie bathe and dress, came to their house, in Sun City Aliante, an \u201cactive adult\u201d community in Las Vegas. They had moved there in 2005, when Rudy, a retired consultant for broadcasters, was sixty-eight and Rennie was sixty-six. They took pride in their view of the golf course, though neither of them played golf.\n Rudy chatted with the nurse in the kitchen for twenty minutes, joking about marriage and laundry, until there was a knock at the door. A stocky woman with shiny black hair introduced herself as April Parks, the owner of the company A Private Professional Guardian. She was accompanied by three colleagues, who didn\u2019t give their names. Parks told the Norths that she had an order from the Clark County Family Court to \u201cremove\u201d them from their home. She would be taking them to an assisted-living facility. \u201cGo and gather your things,\u201d she said.\n  One of Parks\u2019s colleagues said that if the Norths didn\u2019t comply he would call the police. Rudy remembers thinking, You\u2019re going to put my wife and me in jail for this? But he felt too confused to argue.\n  Parks drove a Pontiac G-6 convertible with a license plate that read \u201c ,\u201d for \u201ccourt guardian.\u201d In the past twelve years, she had been a guardian for some four hundred wards of the court. Owing to age or disability, they had been deemed incompetent, a legal term that describes those who are unable to make reasoned choices about their lives or their property. As their guardian, Parks had the authority to manage their assets, and to choose where they lived, whom they associated with, and what medical treatment they received. They lost nearly all their civil rights.\n Without realizing it, the Norths had become temporary wards of the court. Parks had filed an emergency ex-parte petition, which provides an exception to the rule that both parties must be notified of any argument before a judge. She had alleged that the Norths posed a \u201csubstantial risk for mismanagement of medications, financial loss and physical harm.\u201d She submitted a brief letter from a physician\u2019s assistant, whom Rennie had seen once, stating that \u201cthe patient\u2019s husband can no longer effectively take care of the patient at home as his dementia is progressing.\u201d She also submitted a letter from one of Rudy\u2019s doctors, who described him as \u201cconfused and agitated.\u201d\n  Rudy and Rennie had not undergone any cognitive assessments. They had never received a diagnosis of dementia. In addition to Freud, Rudy was working his way through Nietzsche and Plato. Rennie read romance novels.\n  Parks told the Norths that if they didn\u2019t come willingly an ambulance would take them to the facility, a place she described as a \u201crespite.\u201d Still crying, Rennie put cosmetics and some clothes into a suitcase. She packed so quickly that she forgot her cell phone and Rudy\u2019s hearing aid. After thirty-five minutes, Parks\u2019s assistant led the Norths to her car. When a neighbor asked what was happening, Rudy told him, \u201cWe\u2019ll just be gone for a little bit.\u201d He was too proud to draw attention to their predicament. \u201cJust think of it as a mini-vacation,\u201d he told Rennie.\n After the Norths left, Parks walked through the house with Cindy Breck, the owner of Caring Transitions, a company that relocates seniors and sells their belongings at estate sales. Breck and Parks had a routine. \u201cWe open drawers,\u201d Parks said at a deposition. \u201cWe look in closets. We pull out boxes, anything that would store\u2014that would keep paperwork, would keep valuables.\u201d She took a pocket watch, birth certificates, insurance policies, and several collectible coins.\n  The Norths\u2019 daughter, Julie Belshe, came to visit later that afternoon. A fifty-three-year-old mother of three sons, she and her husband run a small business designing and constructing pools. She lived ten miles away and visited her parents nearly every day, often taking them to her youngest son\u2019s football games. She was her parents\u2019 only living child; her brother and sister had died.\n She knocked on the front door several times and then tried to push the door open, but it was locked. She was surprised to see the kitchen window closed; her parents always left it slightly open. She drove to the Sun City Aliante clubhouse, where her parents sometimes drank coffee. When she couldn\u2019t find them there, she thought that perhaps they had gone on an errand together\u2014the farthest they usually drove was to Costco. But, when she returned to the house, it was still empty.\n That weekend, she called her parents several times. She also called two hospitals to see if they had been in an accident. She called their landlord, too, and he agreed to visit the house. He reported that there were no signs of them. She told her husband, \u201cI think someone kidnapped my parents.\u201d\n On the Tuesday after Labor Day, she drove to the house again and found a note taped to the door: \u201cIn case of emergency, contact guardian April Parks.\u201d Belshe dialled the number. Parks, who had a brisk, girlish way of speaking, told Belshe that her parents had been taken to Lakeview Terrace, an assisted-living facility in Boulder City, nine miles from the Arizona border. She assured Belshe that the staff there would take care of all their needs.\n  \u201cYou can\u2019t just walk into somebody\u2019s home and take them!\u201d Belshe told her.\n  Guardianship derives from the state\u2019s  parens patriae power, its duty to act as a parent for those considered too vulnerable to care for themselves. \u201cThe King shall have the custody of the lands of natural fools, taking the profits of them without waste or destruction, and shall find them their necessaries,\u201d reads the English statute  De Prerogative Regis, from 1324. The law was imported to the colonies\u2014guardianship is still controlled by state, not federal, law\u2014and has remained largely intact for the past eight hundred years. It establishes a relationship between ward and guardian that is rooted in trust.\n In the United States, a million and a half adults are under the care of guardians, either family members or professionals, who control some two hundred and seventy-three billion dollars in assets, according to an auditor for the guardianship fraud program in Palm Beach County. Little is known about the outcome of these arrangements, because states do not keep complete figures on guardianship cases\u2014statutes vary widely\u2014and, in most jurisdictions, the court records are sealed. A Government Accountability report from 2010 said, \u201cWe could not locate a single Web site, federal agency, state or local entity, or any other organization that compiles comprehensive information on this issue.\u201d A study published this year by the American Bar Association found that \u201can unknown number of adults languish under guardianship\u201d when they no longer need it, or never did. The authors wrote that \u201cguardianship is generally \u201cpermanent, leaving no way out\u2014\u2018until death do us part.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n When the Norths were removed from their home, they joined nearly nine thousand adult wards in the Las Vegas Valley. In the past twenty years, the city has promoted itself as a retirement paradise. Attracted by the state\u2019s low taxes and a dry, sunny climate, elderly people leave their families behind to resettle in newly constructed senior communities. \u201cThe whole town sparkled, pulling older people in with the prospect of the American Dream at a reasonable price,\u201d a former real-estate agent named Terry Williams told me. Roughly thirty per cent of the people who move to Las Vegas are senior citizens, and the number of Nevadans older than eighty-five has risen by nearly eighty per cent in the past decade.\n In Nevada, as in many states, anyone can become a guardian by taking a course, as long as he or she has not been convicted of a felony or recently declared bankruptcy. Elizabeth Brickfield, a Las Vegas lawyer who has worked in guardianship law for twenty years, said that about fifteen years ago, as the state\u2019s elderly population swelled, \u201call these private guardians started arriving, and the docket exploded. The court became a factory.\u201d\n Pamela Teaster, the director of the Center for Gerontology at Virginia Tech and one of the few scholars in the country who study guardianship, told me that, though most guardians assume their duties for good reasons, the guardianship system is \u201ca morass, a total mess.\u201d She said, \u201cIt is unconscionable that we don\u2019t have any data, when you think about the vast power given to a guardian. It is one of society\u2019s most drastic interventions.\u201d\n After talking to Parks, Belshe drove forty miles to Lakeview Terrace, a complex of stucco buildings designed to look like a hacienda. She found her parents in a small room with a kitchenette and a window overlooking the parking lot. Rennie was in a wheelchair beside the bed, and Rudy was curled up on a love seat in the fetal position. There was no phone in the room. Medical-alert buttons were strung around their necks. \u201cThey were like two lost children,\u201d Belshe said.\n  She asked her parents who Parks was and where she could find the court order, but, she said, \u201cthey were overwhelmed and humiliated, and they didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d They had no idea how or why Parks had targeted them as wards. Belshe was struck by their passive acceptance. \u201cIt was like they had Stockholm syndrome or something,\u201d she told me.\n Belshe acknowledged that her parents needed a few hours of help each day, but she had never questioned their ability to live alone. \u201cThey always kept their house really nice and clean, like a museum,\u201d she said. Although Rudy\u2019s medical records showed that he occasionally had \u201cstaring spells,\u201d all his medical-progress notes from 2013 described him as alert and oriented. He did most of the couple\u2019s cooking and shopping, because Rennie, though lucid, was in so much pain that she rarely left the house. Belshe sometimes worried that her father inadvertently encouraged her mother to be docile: \u201cShe\u2019s a very smart woman, though she sometimes acts like she\u2019s not. I have to tell her, \u2018That\u2019s not cute, Mom.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n  When Belshe called Parks to ask for the court order, Parks told her that she was part of the \u201csandwich generation,\u201d and that it would be too overwhelming for her to continue to care for her children and her parents at the same time. Parks billed her wards\u2019 estates for each hour that she spent on their case; the court placed no limits on guardians\u2019 fees, as long as they appeared \u201creasonable.\u201d Later, when Belshe called again to express her anger, Parks charged the Norths twenty-four dollars for the eight-minute conversation. \u201cI could not understand what the purpose of the call was other than she wanted me to know they had rights,\u201d Parks wrote in a detailed invoice. \u201cI terminated the phone call as she was very hostile and angry.\u201d\n A month after removing the Norths from their house, Parks petitioned to make the guardianship permanent. She was represented by an attorney who was paid four hundred dollars an hour by the Norths\u2019 estate. A hearing was held at Clark County Family Court.\n The Clark County guardianship commissioner, a lawyer named Jon Norheim, has presided over nearly all the guardianship cases in the county since 2005. He works under the supervision of a judge, but his orders have the weight of a formal ruling. Norheim awarded a guardianship to Parks, on average, nearly once a week. She had up to a hundred wards at a time. \u201cI love April Parks,\u201d he said at one hearing, describing her and two other professional guardians, who frequently appeared in his courtroom, as \u201cwonderful, good-hearted, social-worker types.\u201d\n  Norheim\u2019s court perpetuated a cold, unsentimental view of family relations: the ingredients for a good life seemed to have little to do with one\u2019s children and siblings. He often dismissed the objections of relatives, telling them that his only concern was the best interest of the wards, which he seemed to view in a social vacuum. When siblings fought over who would be guardian, Norheim typically ordered a neutral professional to assume control, even when this isolated the wards from their families.\n Rudy had assured Belshe that he would protest the guardianship, but, like most wards in the country, Rudy and Rennie were not represented by counsel. As Rudy stood before the commissioner, he convinced himself that guardianship offered him and Rennie a lifetime of care without being a burden to anyone they loved. He told Norheim, \u201cThe issue really is her longevity\u2014what suits her.\u201d Belshe, who sat in the courtroom, said, \u201cI was shaking my head. No, no, no\u2014don\u2019t do that!\u201d Rennie was silent.\n Norheim ordered that the Norths become permanent wards of the court. \u201cChances are, I\u2019ll probably never see you folks again; you\u2019ll work everything out,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cI very rarely see people after the initial time in court.\u201d The hearing lasted ten minutes.\n The following month, Even Tide Life Transitions, a company that Parks often hired, sold most of the Norths\u2019 belongings. \u201cThe general condition of this inventory is good,\u201d an appraiser wrote. Two lithographs by Renoir were priced at thirty-eight hundred dollars, and a glass cocktail table (\u201cClient states that it is a Brancusi design\u201d) was twelve hundred and fifty dollars. The Norths also had several pastel drawings by their son, Randy, who died in a motorcycle accident at the age of thirty-two, as well as Kachina dolls, a Bose radio, a Dyson vacuum cleaner, a Peruvian tapestry, a motion-step exerciser, a LeRoy Neiman sketch of a bar in Dublin, and two dozen pairs of Clarke shoes. According to Parks\u2019s calculations, the Norths had roughly fifty thousand dollars. Parks transferred their savings, held at the Bank of America, to an account in her name.\n Rennie repeatedly asked for her son\u2019s drawings, and for the family photographs on her refrigerator. Rudy pined for his car, a midnight-blue 2010 Chrysler, which came to symbolize the life he had lost. He missed the routine interactions that driving had allowed him. \u201cEverybody at the pharmacy was my buddy,\u201d he said. Now he and Rennie felt like exiles. Rudy said, \u201cThey kept telling me, \u2018Oh, you don\u2019t have to worry: your car is fine, and this and that.\u2019\u00a0\u201d A month later, he said, \u201cthey finally told me, \u2018Actually, we sold your car.\u2019 I said, \u2018What in the hell did you sell it for?\u2019\u00a0\u201d It was bought for less than eight thousand dollars, a price that Rudy considered insulting.\n Rudy lingered in the dining room after eating breakfast each morning, chatting with other residents of Lakeview Terrace. He soon discovered that ten other wards of April Parks lived there. His next-door neighbor, Adolfo Gonzalez, a short, bald seventy-one-year-old who had worked as a ma\u00eetre d\u2019 at the MGM Grand Las Vegas, had become Parks\u2019s ward at a hearing that lasted a minute and thirty-one seconds.\n Gonzalez, who had roughly three hundred and fifty thousand dollars in assets, urged Rudy not to accept the nurse\u2019s medications. \u201cIf you take the pills, they\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t make it to court,\u201d he said. Gonzalez had been prescribed the antipsychotic medications Risperdal and Depakote, which he hid in the side of his mouth without swallowing. He wanted to remain vigilant. He often spoke of a Salvador Dali painting that had been lost when Parks took over his life. Once, she charged him two hundred and ten dollars for a visit in which, according to her invoice, he expressed that \u201che feels like a prisoner.\u201d\n  Rudy was so distressed by his conversations with Gonzalez that he asked to see a psychologist. \u201cI thought maybe he\u2019d give me some sort of objective learning as to what I was going through,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to ask basic questions, like What the hell is going on?\u201d Rudy didn\u2019t find the session illuminating, but he felt a little boost to his self-esteem when the psychologist asked that he return for a second appointment. \u201cI guess he found me terribly charming,\u201d he told me.\n Rudy liked to fantasize about an alternative life as a psychoanalyst, and he tried to befriend the wards who seemed especially hopeless. \u201cLoneliness is a physical pain that hurts all over,\u201d he wrote in his notebook. He bought a pharmaceutical encyclopedia and advised the other wards about medications they\u2019d been prescribed. He also ran for president of the residents, promising that under his leadership the kitchen would no longer advertise canned food as homemade. (He lost\u2014he\u2019s not sure if anyone besides Rennie voted for him\u2014but he did win a seat on the residents\u2019 council.)\n He was particularly concerned about a ward of Parks\u2019s named Marlene Homer, a seventy-year-old woman who had been a professor. \u201cNow she was almost hiding behind the pillars,\u201d Rudy said. \u201cShe was so obsequious. She was, like, \u2018Run me over. Run me over.\u2019\u00a0\u201d She\u2019d become a ward in 2012, after Parks told the court, \u201cShe has admitted to strange thoughts, depression, and doing things she can\u2019t explain.\u201d On a certificate submitted to the court, an internist had checked a box indicating that Homer was \u201cunable to attend the guardianship court hearing because______,\u201d but he didn\u2019t fill in a reason.\n  The Norths could guess which residents were Parks\u2019s wards by the way they were dressed. Gonzalez wore the same shirt to dinner nearly every day. \u201cForgive me,\u201d he told the others at his table. When a friend tried to take him shopping, Parks prevented the excursion because she didn\u2019t know the friend. Rennie had also tried to get more clothes. \u201cI reminded ward that she has plenty of clothing in her closet,\u201d Parks wrote. \u201cI let her know that they are on a tight budget.\u201d The Norths\u2019 estate was charged a hundred and eighty dollars for the conversation.\n Another resident, Barbara Neely, a fifty-five-year-old with schizophrenia, repeatedly asked Parks to buy her outfits for job interviews. She was applying for a position with the Department of Education. After Neely\u2019s third week at Lakeview Terrace, Parks\u2019s assistant sent Parks a text. \u201cCan you see Barbara Neely anytime this week?\u201d she wrote. \u201cShe has questions on the guardianship and how she can get out of it.\u201d Parks responded, \u201cI can and she can\u2019t.\u201d Neely had been in the process of selling her house, for a hundred and sixty-eight thousand dollars, when Parks became her guardian and took charge of the sale.\n The rationale for the guardianship of Norbert Wilkening, who lived on the bottom floor of the facility, in the memory-care ward, for people with dementia (\u201cthe snake pit,\u201d Rudy called it), was also murky. Parks\u2019s office manager, who advertised himself as a \u201cQualified Dementia Care Specialist\u201d\u2014a credential acquired through video training sessions\u2014had given Wilkening a \u201cMini-Mental State Examination,\u201d a list of eleven questions and tasks, including naming as many animals as possible in a minute. Wilkening had failed. His daughter, Amy, told me, \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything that was happening to him other than a regular getting-older process, but when I was informed by all these people that he had all these problems I was, like, Well, maybe I\u2019m just in denial.

", "note_en": "Many a pub crawler has engaged in the time-honored tradition of throwing beer mats\u2014those round cardboard coasters that are ubiquitous in bars\u2014as if the mats were frisbees, often competing to see who can throw one the farthest.\u00a0But unlike frisbees, beer mats tend to flip in the air and fly with a backspin. Now physicists at the University of Bonn have come up with a theoretical model to explain the phenomenon, according to\u00a0 a new paper submitted to the physics arXiv preprint server.\n Thanks to their natural curiosity, physicists are fascinated by the physics of beer, and lead author Johann Ostmeyer is no exception. A couple of years ago, he became intrigued by the physics of so-called &#34;beer tapping&#34;: a common prank where the perpetrator, holding an open bottle of beer, finds a target in the bar holding another open bottle. The prankster strikes the top of the target&#39;s bottle with the bottom of their own, then savors the sight of beer explosively foaming all over the target&#39;s hands and clothes.\n Back in 2013, Javier Rodr\u00edguez-Rodr\u00edguez, a physicist at Carlos III University of Madrid, and several colleagues presented experimental and computer-simulation findings of why beer cans  foam up so much after being shaken. They concluded that the foaming-over stemmed from a series of waves. Apparently the physics is similar to the development of the cloud in an atomic bomb, although the source of the &#34;explosion&#34; is very different.\n  The initial tap creates a shockwave that travels from the top to the bottom of the target&#39;s bottle. That shockwave&#39;s energy is transferred to the beer, sending a second shockwave bouncing back and forth between the bottom of the bottle and the beer&#39;s surface. All that activity releases tiny pockets of gas trapped in small imperfections in the bottle&#39;s glass, creating clouds of smaller bubbles from the beer&#39;s dissolved CO 2. As they rise to the surface, those bubbles get bigger and speed up, eventually creating the shower of foam that makes beer tapping such a popular pub prank.\n    Ostmeyer  submitted his own analysis on the beer tapping issue to the arXiv last year, specifically focusing on why the lower beer bottle foams over and the upper one does not. The initial tap creates a low pressure in the lower bottle, and the CO 2 bubbles expand and collapse into fragments.\n  More gas gets diffused into the cluster of bubbles, rising up to create the foam. Something different happens in the top bottle. There is a higher initial pressure, so there are only moderate oscillations in the bubbles, and the eventual bubble collapse doesn&#39;t happen\u2014or at least not to the same extent. Thus, you don&#39;t get the same rapid growth cloud turning your entire beer into foam. &#34;The prankster leaves the scene dry,&#34; Ostmeyer wrote.\n Now Ostmeyer,\u00a0inspired by a 2017 trip to Munich for a German physics outreach demonstration show, has turned his attention to the pressing question of beer-mat flight trajectories.\u00a0Beer mats (at least the round variety) are basically thin, flat disks with a given radius and mass. A  frisbee is also a thin flat disk, and the physics surrounding its flight is well-known.\n A frisbee&#39;s distinctive curved upper surface is essentially the same shape (when viewed from the side) as an airfoil. Throw it with sufficient force to overcome the downward pull of gravity, and it will generate lift. Of course, there is also air resistance, or drag, acting on the frisbee as it flies through the air. The resistance depends on the angle of attack. If the angle is negative, it pushes the air up and forces the frisbee down, while a positive angle will push the frisbee up. To keep wobbling to a minimum, professional frisbee players know to add a spin when they throw, ensuring their frisbees stay on a single plane as they travel.\n    But beer mats don&#39;t have the frisbee&#39;s distinctive airfoil-like edge, and that affects their aerodynamics. Ostmeyer  et al. began by assuming a horizontal flight and an axis of rotation perpendicular to the direction it is moving. Toss a beer mat like a frisbee, and the rotation will initially stabilize it.\n    However, the pull of gravity will soon cause the mat to drop, which will alter the angle at which it attacks the air. You&#39;ll still get lift, but it will be focused close to the leading edge rather than the mat&#39;s center of mass. So the mat will start to precess, forcing it to flip on its side so that it is traveling vertically. The researchers&#39; model predicted that this should happen at about 0.45 seconds into the flight.\u00a0Furthermore, the model showed that the mat could have either a backspin (which is stable) or a topspin (which is unstable). Thus, the mat will be more likely to have a backspin.\n Every good theoretical prediction must be experimentally tested, of course, and randomly tossing beer mats around in the local pub wouldn&#39;t be scientifically rigorous. Thrown by hand, the timing of the tilt appears to be random, but the model predicts otherwise. So Ostmeyer and his team\u00a0built their own makeshift beer-mat launcher out of two electric motor-powered treadmills. The launcher enabled the researchers to control the horizontal velocity and rate of rotation of each launch.\n The researchers placed the launcher on a table, then placed a beer mat between the treadmills and launched the mats at various speeds, marking where they landed on the floor. The flight trajectories were recorded with high-speed cameras, and the team used a program called Tracker to extract the coordinates of the beer mat at any point along its trajectory. The results of the researchers&#39; subsequent analysis showed very good agreement with the theoretical predictions.\n Ostmeyer  et al.&#39;s theoretical model can also be used to predict the flight trajectories of other kinds of flying discs. For instance, their model predicts that a CD will flip after 0.8 seconds, while a larger and heavier discus will flip after 16 seconds. A flying playing card has the shortest trajectory of all, flipping after just 0.24 seconds. &#34;Even Rick Smith Jr., the world record holder for farthest card thrown, or a playing card machine gun, cannot avoid their cards flying a curve and ending up with backspin after much less than a second,&#34; the authors wrote in a footnote.\n The model&#39;s prediction for a frisbee\u2014without taking into account any aerodynamics due to its curvature\u2014is a surprising 0.8 seconds. &#34;Of course, the wing form of a frisbee allows it to remain stable for a much longer time when thrown professionally,&#34; they wrote. &#34;The reason is that frisbees have their aerodynamic center very near to their center of mass and, thus, experience much less torque.&#34;\n We raise a glass to Ostmeyer and his colleagues for their entertaining and informative work, which was driven purely by scientific curiosity.&#34;Our sincere apologies to everyone hit by a beer mat,&#34; the authors noted in their acknowledgements, &#34;be it through inaccurate aim or due to us instigating others to perform silly experiments.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-24 06:17:14", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8868\u660e,show,\u5564\u9152", "title": "\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u98de\u884c\u5564\u9152\u676f\u676f\u5c06\u5728\u98de\u884c\u4e2d\u7ffb\u8f6c0.45\u79d2 ", "title_en": "Physicists show that flying beer coasters will flip 0.45 seconds into flight", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/the-physics-of-why-that-flying-beer-coaster-is-nothing-like-a-frisbee/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8868\u660e", "show", "\u5564\u9152"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "0c1cba74492b36e17f2bd1cf61719a2a.jpg", "infoid": 1067854, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u521b\u59cb\u4ebaJohn McAfee\u5728McAfee Antivirus\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u6839\u636eReuters\uff0cEl Mundo\uff0cElPa\u00eds\u7b49\u7684\u62a5\u9053\u88ab\u53d1\u73b0\u6b7b\u4ea1\u3002\u4ed6\u6b63\u5728\u5df4\u585e\u7f57\u90a3\u76d1\u72f1\u4e3e\u884c\uff0c\u52a0\u6cf0\u7f57\u5c3c\u4e9a\u53f8\u6cd5\u90e8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u6b7b\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7531\u81ea\u6740\u800c\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u3002\u8fc8\u514b\u83f2\u7684\u5f8b\u5e08\u5411\u8def\u900f\u793e\u548c\u7ebd\u7ea6\u65f6\u62a5\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684\u6b7b\u4ea1\uff0c\u4e00\u8a00\u8bed\u662f\u201c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b8b\u9177\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u7406\u7531\u8ba9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7537\u4eba\u5728\u76d1\u72f1\u91cc\u8fd9\u4e48\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u201d\n  \u81ea2020\u5e7410\u6708\u88ab\u6355\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u8fc8\u514b\u83f2\u5728\u76d1\u72f1\u4e3e\u884c\u76d1\u72f1\uff0c\u5f85\u9001\u5230\u7f8e\u56fd\u3002\u4ed6\u9762\u4e34\u9003\u7a0e\u7684\u6307\u63a7\uff0c\u5e76\u88ab\u6307\u63a7\u4e0e\u6d89\u5acc\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u8fd0\u6cf5\u548c\u8f6c\u50a8\u8ba1\u5212\u6709\u5173\u7684\u8bc1\u5238\u6b3a\u8bc8\u3002\u6839\u636eReuters\u548cEl Mundo\u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\uff0c\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u6cd5\u9662\u4eca\u5929\u65e9\u4e0a\u6279\u51c6\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eca\u5929\u65e9\u4e0a\u7684\u5f15\u6e21\uff0c\u673a\u4f1a\u4e0a\u8bc9\u3002\n \u8fc8\u514b\u83f2\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u6293\u4f4f\u7684\u3002\u4ed6\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6bd2\u54c1\u71c3\u6599\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4ed6\u672a\u5b89\u88c5McAfee Antivirus\uff0c\u58f0\u79f0\u5df2\u7ecf\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u963b\u6b62NSA\u76d1\u89c6\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u603b\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c -

He was being held in a Barcelona prison, and the Catalan Department of Justice has stated that his death was likely caused by suicide. Lawyers for McAfee confirmed his death to  Reuters  and  The New York Times, with one saying  it was \u201cthe result of a cruel system that had no reason to keep this man in jail for so long.\u201d\n  McAfee was being held in prison,  pending extradition to the US, since his arrest in October 2020. He faced  charges of tax evasion and had also  been charged with securities fraud relating to an alleged cryptocurrency pump and dump scheme. Spanish courts had approved his extradition this morning with opportunity for appeal, according to   Reuters and   El Mundo .\n McAfee\u2019s story over the past decade has been headline-grabbing. He\u2019s  released a drug-fueled video in which he un-installs McAfee Antivirus, claimed to have made a device  that blocked NSA surveillance, and  run for president \u2014 twice, in 2016 and 2020. He\u2019s also a noted cryptocurrency promoter, who  once claimed to charge $105,000 for each promotional tweet, if you wanted McAfee to boost your cryptocurrency or initial coin offering on Twitter\u2019s platform.\n In 2014,  Intel rebranded the antivirus software that bore McAfee\u2019s name, changing it to \u201cIntel Security.\u201d In response, McAfee told the BBC that he was grateful that \u201cthe worst software on the planet\u201d was no longer associated with his name. McAfee later sued Intel after it warned him that naming a new cybersecurity company after himself would be trademark infringement. McAfee  later agreed to a settlement with Intel, saying that he wouldn\u2019t use his name in connection to any cybersecurity products or services he worked on.\n McAfee has a history of run-ins with law enforcement. He, his family, and members of his security forces  were arrested by the Belize police in 2012, after drug and firearm charges. He  went on the run later that year, after the Belize police declared that he  was wanted for questioning in relation to the murder of his neighbor.\n  The story became one of the  focuses of a 2016 Showtime documentary, which sought to prove that McAfee was involved not only in that murder, but other crimes as well.  As recently as 2019, McAfee called the case against him \u201cfrivolous,\u201d and refused to pay a $25 million judgement against him in a wrongful death suit. He  also claimed that he had over $200 million in judgements against him in other legal cases, but that he could not pay any of them.\n In recent years, McAfee claimed to be on the run from the CIA,  tweeting a picture of himself on a boat holding a gun. McAfee has also  tweeted multiple times, once  after his October arrest, that he wouldn\u2019t kill himself, and those tweets are already leading to conspiracy theories about his death.\n The US Department of Justice tells  The Verge that it has no comment on the matter, referring us to Spanish authorities.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 06:16:51", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name":

", "note_en": "\u201cShared e-scooters catapulted shared micromobility to the center stage of eco-friendly  transportation in cities by providing more than 150 million zero-emission trips globally,\u201d said  Travis VanderZanden, founder and CEO of Bird, in a statement. \u201cWe are launching our shared Bird Bike and  Smart Bikeshare platform to meet fast-growing demand from cities and riders for more  sustainable transportation options while expanding our serviceable addressable market by 5  billion trips per year.\u201d\n This announcement comes just a month after Bird dropped   its new Bird Three scooter with better battery life . The micromobility giant\u2019s shared e-bike will roll out later this year, with Cleveland, Ohio, being one of the first markets, according to a spokesperson for the company. In a statement, Bird said the bike will be available in select cities throughout North America, Italy, Spain, Germany, Ireland and France this year. Bird did not say how many e-bikes it would be launching or give a more specific launch date.\n  Bird also did not respond to whether or not the e-bike is designed or manufactured by the company, and if not, which manufacturer the company is working with.\n  The Bird Bike is built on a 75-pound frame with a step-through design that can drive riders up hills with as much as a 20% grade, according to the company. It\u2019ll have a front basket, large pneumatic tires and all the on-board geofencing and diagnostics that you\u2019d expect from a Bird vehicle.\n The Bird Bike is not Bird\u2019s first bike. In the summer of 2019,   the company unveiled its Bird Cruiser , an electric cross between a bike and a moped that could seat up to two people. But they decided to pause the pilot last year at the onset of the pandemic, according to a spokesperson for the company.\n Bird\u2019s bikeshare platform has already kicked off in Italy with local e-moped company  Zig Zag, displaying the Italian company\u2019s vehicles alongside its own in the Bird app. Bird says it wants to collaborate with other micromobility companies around the world and is in talks with groups like the North American Bikeshare Association to do so in the U.S.\n Bird did not answer questions about whether it would receive a cut of local operators\u2019 profits if booked through the Bird app.\n In a statement from the company, Bird\u2019s bikeshare platform makes the company \u201cthe first scooter operator to integrate with local shared bike and e-moped providers.\u201d Bird does not currently have plans to integrate third party, e-scooter providers into their app, according to the company.\n If Bird isn\u2019t collaborating with local e-scooter providers, sharing its platform with e-bike and e-moped providers allows it the chance to have more of a multi-modal presence without doing the heavy lifting of actually launching multi-modal fleets. At the very least, these collaborations will also give Bird a better idea of where and how riders are using different vehicles, which could help the company decide on new mobility modes to invest in, while also informing its own expansion plans, especially in Europe.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 06:16:24", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7a0b\u5e8f,\u5171\u4eab,shared", "title": "Bird\u63a8\u51fa\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6253\u5f00\u5230\u5f53\u5730\u5171\u4eab\u8fd0\u8425\u5546 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tBird launches shared e-bikes and opens its app to local shared operators\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/bird-launches-shared-e-bikes-and-opens-its-app-to-local-shared-operators/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7a0b\u5e8f", "\u5171\u4eab", "shared"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e184dd604d6a185d1fc3a3000f644744.jpg", "infoid": 1067852, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u538c\u5026\u4e86\u4f60\u7684Instagram\u9972\u6599\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df7\u4e71\u7684\u4e1d\u7ef8\u7684\u88ab\u5c4f\u853d\u7684\u63a8\u6587\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u5f00\u59cb\u7684tiktoks\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u90a3\u4e9b\u4e1c\u897f\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5373\u5c06\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u8981\u597d\u5f97\u591a\u3002\n Twitter\u521a\u521a\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u4eab\u63a8\u8350\u7ed9Instagram\u6545\u4e8b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8ba9\u60a8\u59a5\u5584\u904d\u5e03\u5de7\u5999\u7684\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u77e9\u3002\u4f60\u65e0\u6cd5\u70b9\u51fb\u63a8\u6587\u8df3\u56deTwitter\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u4eec\u73b0\u5728\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u5f88\u597d\u3002\u4e0d\u5e78\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8eAndroid\u7528\u6237\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5b83\u73b0\u5728\u53ea\u662fiOS\u3002\n  \u8df3\u8fc7\u5c4f\u5e55\u622a\u56fe - \u5206\u4eabTweets\u5230Instagram Offer Seal\u83dc\u5355\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u73b0\u5728\u6b63\u5728\u63a8\u51faiOS\u4e0a\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\uff01\n \u70b9\u51fbTweet\u4e0a\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u56fe\u6807\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u9009\u62e9\u201cInstagram Stories\u201d\u3002\u4e00\u65e6\u60a8\u7684Instagram\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6253\u5f00\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u53d1\u5e03\u4e4b\u524d\u8c03\u6574/\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4dTweet\u8d34\u7eb8\u3002 https://t.co/r1qayqmwyl pic.twitter.com/yp82ih5tuk.\n  \u65b0\u7684\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u529f\u80fd\u53ea\u662fTwitter\u6700\u8fd1\u4ee4\u4eba\u8033\u76ee\u4e00\u65b0\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u578b\u6837\u672c - \u8fd9\u662f\u4ece\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5b89\u88c5\u538b\u529b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8be5\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u88ab\u6307\u8d23\u516c\u53f8\u505c\u6ede\u4e0d\u524d\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u5212\u4e89\u593a\u5176\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\uff0c\u6770\u514b\u7f57\u897f\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8fd8\u521a\u521a\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6765\u6388\u6743\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u6388\u6743\u63a8\u6587\uff1a\u5df2\u77e5\u4e3a\u201c\u8d85\u7ea7\u9075\u5faa\u201d\u548c\u7968\u52a1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u4ed8\u8d39\u8ba2\u9605\u3002\n Twitter\u7528\u6237\u957f\u671f\u4ee5\u6765\u4e00\u76f4\u7b49\u5f85\u5c11\u91cf\u751f\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6d17\u8863\u6e05\u5355\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f80\u5f80\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u62b1\u6028\u4f60\u4ecd\u7136\u65e0\u6cd5\u7f16\u8f91\u63a8\u6587\u7684\u6574\u4e2a\u8bb0\u8005\u961f\u5458\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u4f46\u5982\u679c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u8282\u594f\uff0cTwitter\u53ef\u80fd\u6700\u7ec8\u53ef\u4ee5\u9001\u8fbe\u3002 ", "note_en": "If you\u2019re tired of your Instagram feed mostly being a chaotic mashup of screencapped tweets and reshared TikToks, well, those things probably aren\u2019t going away but one is about to look a lot better.\n Twitter just added the capability to share a tweet directly to Instagram Stories, letting you port your clever cross-platform moments over properly.

The identity of the biological tissue responsible for sensing the field\u2019s direction, and the sensory mechanism that underpins this type of navigation, have remained an enigma. In migratory birds, the main contenders are magnetically sensitive proteins called cryptochromes, which are located in the retina  2. However, proof has been lacking that these proteins truly possess the magnetic sensitivity and physical properties needed to detect Earth\u2019s extremely weak magnetic field.  Writing in  Nature, Xu  et al.  3 provide this proof  in vitro, bringing us tantalizingly close to solving the mystery of magnetoreception.\n  There are currently two main hypotheses for how animals sense Earth\u2019s magnetic field  1 ,  4 (as well as some alternative hypotheses put forward in the past few years  5 ,  6). One proposes that, as an animal changes direction, crystals of the oxidized-iron compound magnetite (Fe 3O 4), located in its body and aligned with the field, exert a rotational force \u2014 called torque \u2014 on mechanoreceptors with which they are in physical contact. This might thereby signal changes in body alignment through the opening and closing of mechanoreceptor ion channels.\n The other main hypothesis (Fig. 1) proposes that, when cryptochrome proteins absorb photons of light and become \u2018photoexcited\u2019, they form magnetically sensitive chemical intermediates known as radical pairs. Variations in the yield of their reaction product (the form of the cryptochrome that contains a radical molecule called FADH \u2022) are thought to signal the animal\u2019s direction with respect to Earth\u2019s magnetic field  7 ,  8. These two proposed mechanisms are not mutually exclusive  6 \u2014 indeed, migratory birds might possess both, using magnetite for their \u2018magnetic-map\u2019 sense (the ability to sense magnetic characteristics associated with a given location on Earth\u2019s surface) and cryptochromes for their magnetic-compass sense (which offers the animal a way to sense its direction relative to magnetic north)  1 ,  2.\n  Cryptochromes are found both in animals and in plants, and are a type of protein known as a flavoprotein. Cryptochromes bind non-covalently to a molecule called a chromophore, such as FAD, which absorbs photons of blue light when in its fully oxidized state. In animals, cryptochrome proteins termed CRY1 and CRY2 are involved in the regulation of daily (circadian) rhythms  9, and their expression levels in tissue typically cycle over the course of 24 hours. By contrast, the cryptochrome CRY4 lacks such signs of circadian cycling, suggesting that it has a different biological role, possibly that of magnetoreception  10 ,  11. CRY4 is found only in birds, fishes and amphibians, which are types of animal with well-documented magnetically guided behaviours. CRY4 has therefore emerged as the leading candidate for enabling cryptochrome-based magnetoreception in vertebrates.\n Previous analysis  10 of chickens ( Gallus gallus) and migratory European robins ( Erithacus rubecula) indicates that CRY4 is located in the outer segments of two types of photoreceptor cell in the retina \u2014 double cones and long-wavelength single cones. This is an ideal location for receiving the light that would excite cryptochromes and thus aid magnetic sensing. Further evidence consistent with a possible role for CRY4 in magnetoreception is that its expression level in the robin retina rises as the migratory season approaches, whereas its level remains permanently low in non-migratory chickens  10.\n  Xu and colleagues\u2019 major advance is the demonstration that the version of CRY4 (dubbed  ErCRY4) in the migratory European robin has a crucial property needed to sense Earth\u2019s magnetic field: the ability to form radical pairs that have high magnetic sensitivity. Radical pairs arise when the FAD bound to  ErCRY4 is reduced (gains an electron) in the presence of light. Radicals contain an odd number of electrons, and a radical pair consists of two radicals that have been created simultaneously, usually by a chemical reaction. In  ErCRY4, the radicals\u2019 odd electrons are supplied through sequential electron-hopping along a chain of three or four tryptophan amino-acid residues (termed Trp A to Trp D) that are located between FAD and the surface of the cryptochrome.\n In the case of FAD, the odd electron that arises from reduction in the presence of light makes the radicals intrinsically magnetic. This is because electrons behave as microscopic magnets, with a property that physicists call spin (typically symbolized by an arrow \u2191). In a molecule with an even number of electrons, the spins of each electron pair exactly cancel each other out, rendering the molecule non-magnetic.\n If the spins of the odd electrons in each of the two radicals in a radical pair are antiparallel (\u2193\u2191), the radical pair is said to occupy a singlet state, but when they are parallel (\u2191\u2191), the pair occupies a triplet state. When cryptochrome becomes photoexcited, it always forms a radical pair in the singlet state, but it doesn\u2019t stay that way for long. Owing to a quirk of quantum mechanics, the radical pair rapidly converts to the triplet state, and then continues to bounce between these two states millions of times per second. Each of these two states can produce a reaction product \u2014 the form of CRY4 that contains the radical FADH \u2022, which is the proposed signalling molecule for magnetoreception (Fig. 1). But the singlet state can also revert to its oxidized, non-excited ground state, thereby reducing its relative contribution to the generation of reaction products. Thus, if the interconversion of the singlet and triplet states can be manipulated to change the relative amounts of time spent in each of the two states, so too can the yield of the reaction products be manipulated, because a greater fraction of time in the triplet state leads to a higher yield of reaction products.\n  Herein lies the heart of the proposed cryptochrome-based magnetosensor: the relative amounts of time spent in the singlet and triplet states and the yield of reaction products are directly manipulated by the direction of Earth\u2019s magnetic field. The interaction between a single  ErCRY4 molecule and the field is, on its own, at least one million times too weak to create the radicals and influence their stability  2, but the energy required is provided by the photon absorbed by FAD. However, for this to work at all, the radical pair must be sufficiently magnetically sensitive, and the reaction product must exist for long enough and have a sufficiently high yield to realistically act as a sensory signalling substance. In a tour de force of biophysical chemistry, Xu and colleagues used a wide range of techniques, such as spectroscopic methods and molecular-dynamics simulations, to show that all of these conditions are satisfied by  ErCRY4, at least  in vitro.\n Not only does  ErCRY4 have a much higher magnetic sensitivity than do CRY4 proteins in non-migratory pigeons and chickens, but site-specific mutations of amino-acid residues in  ErCRY4 also reveal that its Trp D is probably responsible for generating high and long-lasting (of greater-than-millisecond duration) yields of reaction products that would be needed for magnetosensory signalling. Although the evidence provided by Xu and colleagues is not definitive proof that  ErCRY4 is the elusive magnetoreceptor  in vivo, the authors have brought us ever closer to solving this abiding mystery of sensory biology.\n      7.

Unlisted videos will be made Private unless you opt out from this change. This is part of a  security update to Unlisted videos that were uploaded before January 1, 2017. Unlisted content uploaded on or after January 1, 2017 is unaffected by this change.\n  In 2017, we rolled out an update to the system that generates new YouTube Unlisted links. This update included security enhancements that make the links for your Unlisted videos even harder for someone to discover if you haven\u2019t shared the link with them. We\u2019re now making changes to older Unlisted videos that were uploaded before this update took place. We understand that this change may be challenging, so we\u2019re giving you time to make adjustments to your videos before this change takes effect on July 23, 2021.\n To see the videos affected by this change,  click here from a computer to go to\u00a0your Unlisted videos uploaded before 2017. Or, sign in to  YouTube Studio from a computer. Then:\n      Note: Some older Unlisted playlists were also created in the old system. If you own legacy playlists, you should have gotten an email notification with the details from  no-reply@google.com. All of the options below to manage this change also apply to playlists. Letting this content go Private, opting out of this change to keep them Unlisted, creating the playlist again to keep it more secure, or making it Public.\n  Unlisted videos that you uploaded before January 1, 2017 will automatically be made Private. If you want your video to be Private, there\u2019s nothing you need to do. Private videos won\u2019t show in Public search results and viewers won\u2019t see them in the \u201cVideos\u201d tab on your channel homepage.\n  Once your Unlisted video moves to Private, viewers who had a link to your video can no longer watch or share it.\n  If you embedded the video in a website or app, it will no longer work.\n  Private videos can only be shared with up to 50 email addresses. Anyone you share the video with must have a Google account. Learn more about  sharing a Private video.\n  Comments posted while the video was Unlisted also won\u2019t be available if the video is Private. These comments are not deleted. If you want to allow comments on the video, you\u2019ll need to make the video Public or Unlisted.\n  First, you should check whether you own legacy content. Then, you can take one of four actions:\n Do nothing and we\u2019ll make the Unlisted video Private starting July 23, 2021: Private videos are only seen by you and viewers you choose. Keep in mind, though\u2014if you embedded the video in a website or app, it will no longer work.\n  Opt out of this change to keep your Unlisted video in its current state: You can opt out to keep your videos in their current Unlisted state by filling out this  form by July 23, 2021.\u00a0If you treat your Unlisted videos like Public videos (e.g. they\u2019re embedded on third party sites or shared on social media), we recommend you opt out of this change. If you choose to opt out, your existing links will continue working as they do today, but they won\u2019t get the benefit of the security update.\n    Re-upload the Unlisted video as a new Unlisted video: If you want to keep your videos Unlisted and benefit from this security update, you\u2019ll need to download them and re-upload them as Unlisted under the new system. Note that data associated with the original upload, such as views or comments, won\u2019t be attached to the new upload. If you\u2019ve embedded the video on a website or app, you\u2019ll have to update the link to point to the new video.\n We\u2019re letting you know about this change now so you have time to manage your video\u2019s privacy settings.\n  Viewers with whom you shared the link to your Unlisted video in the past, will continue to be able to see it. Note that your video is now available to anyone using YouTube.\n  A Public video is posted on your channel, may show up in Public search results and recommendations.\n  Your video will keep all the data associated with it, such as views or comments.\n  If it\u2019s the first time you are making this content Public, there will be notifications for your subscribers and these videos will appear in the subscriptions feed where subscribers see recently uploaded videos from the channels they follow.\n  If you upload the video again as Unlisted, it will get the benefit of this security update.\n    Data associated with the original upload such as watch time, views, and comments will be in your reports but won\u2019t be attached to the new upload.\n  If you\u2019ve embedded the video in a website or app, you must update the video URL or reference.\n  If you no longer have a copy of the video, you may download it from Creator Studio. Downloads can happen as an MP4 in either 360p or 720p, depending on what you uploaded. Or, a higher-quality version of the file may be available at Google Takeout. Note that  Google Takeout will download all the videos that you\u2019ve ever uploaded, but not individual videos. For both Creator Studio and Takeout, videos with a copyright claim aren\u2019t available to download. Learn more  here.\n  You can opt out and keep your video in its current Unlisted state by filling out this  form. If you treat your Unlisted videos like Public content (e.g. they\u2019re embedded on third party sites or shared on social media), we recommend you opt out of this change. If you choose to opt out, your legacy links will continue working as they do today but they won\u2019t get the benefit of this security update.\n  Viewers with whom you had shared the link to your Unlisted video in the past, will continue to be able to see it.\n  If you embedded the video in a website or app, it will continue to play as usual.\n  Your video will keep all the data associated with it, such as views or comments.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 06:06:45", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "youtube,\u9009\u62e9,older,\u89c6\u9891",

", "note_en": "I was looking for an interesting hobby project to hone my AVR assembly skills when I found the Arduboy, a sturdy \u201cArduino\u201d I could keep in my pocket.\n There were a lot of fun games already and even some in 3D but no filled-polygon games? This had to be rectified.\n    The Arduboy is a portable game console compatible with the Arduino IDE and uses the same microcontroller as the Arduino Leonardo, an ATmega32u4 but unlike the Leonardo board it comes with hardware pre-attached all in a nice sturdy casing.\n The ATmega32u4 contains an 8 bits CPU, a tiny bit of RAM, some flash ROM for the program and data, a tiny EEPROM for saving data when the power goes out, and features a bunch of GPIO pins to connect to external hardware.\n  The display is 128\u00d764 1bpp which means that a full frame takes away 1KB of our memory. Unless we\u2019re generating the display on the fly (which isn\u2019t practical for a polygon-based 3D game, I tried. More on that later)  we\u2019re left with 1.5KB of RAM for all our working data including the CPU stack.\n It is connect to the MCU via one-way SPI and we don\u2019t get the v-sync signal from the OLED controller as that particular display manufacturer did not expose the signal on the ribbon cable. &lt;jackie_chan_wtf.jpg&gt;\n There is no audio generation circuitry. The sound has to be generated in software through an IRQ for each PWM pulse. Eating away at our precious CPU time.\n   In late May 2018 when I got my unit I started with a filled-polygon rasterizer to see if it\u2019d be possible to get anything at a playable speed.\n  Then I started experimenting with different game concepts. To see which styles would fit the OLED display better, the engine\u2019s performance, ROM space, limited controls, etc.\n  I settled for a concept based on Nintendo\u2019s Star Fox on the SNES.\n    Debugging on MCU hardware is never as convenient as on your favorite workstation in your favorite IDE with all the nice tools like boundary checkers and log files.\n So I moved the project out of the Arduino IDE and into my own Makefile-based build system with a native PC port so I could do as much testing on PC without having to program the flash every time.\n  It also lets me do some convenient time-saving things like showing the bounding boxes and bezier paths in a level preview window and live-editing the levels and sounds.\n  If you\u2019re planning on spending months of your spare time working on a game invest time in making your life easier first. Doesn\u2019t take long to pay off.\n  Moving out of the Arduino IDE let me throw out the USB library and a few others pieces. But that meant I didn\u2019t have access to the USB serial port for debugging\u2026\n    By default the display controller is in \u201chorizontal mode\u201d which is fine for 2D blitting but isn\u2019t convenient for rasterizing polygon.\n Luckily the controller has a \u201cVertical Addressing Mode\u201d which turns the memory mapping into a familiar and rasterizing-friendly 64\u00d7128 screen (sideways) of 8\u00d7128 bytes starting at the top left, going right, with the lsb on the leftmost pixel (0x01 = leftmost, 0x80 = rightmost).\n   static const uint8_t init_cmds[] PROGMEM = {  0xAE,   0xA8, 64-1,  0xD3, 0x00,  0x40,  0x8D, 0x14,  0xC8,  0xDA, 0x12,  0x81, 0xFF,  0xd9, 0x22,  0xDB, 0x00,  0x2E,  0xA6,  0xA4,  0xAF,  0x20, 0x01,  0xA0  };\n The great thing about making a 3D engine is you don\u2019t really care which way the screen is. You can just fix this in the projection matrix.\n  I\u2019m not going to get into the details of rasterizing polygons as there\u2019s already plenty of books and tutorials about this both online and in dead tree format. Pick your favorite.\n As long as texturing isn\u2019t involved the CPU can handle it just fine. With 32 registers it\u2019s very apt at this job.\n  However I used a little trick for the sky box. It\u2019s actually a dynamically generated 2\u00d796 texture drawn over the screen in a skewed fashion according to the camera\u2019s angle by projecting the horizon onto the edges of the screen to figure out the height and slope.\n The lines representing the ground are drawn onto the background pattern before clearing the frame buffer with it. Their position is calculated according to the projection matrix.\n  ROM space is at a premium here so obviously data needs to be compressed somehow. We also don\u2019t have much RAM to work with so everything will have to be decompressed (or generated!) on the fly.\n And a balance has to be struck between the saved data and the decompressor code. Each instruction on the CPU is 2 bytes and this can add up quickly.\n I didn\u2019t want to model 3D objects by entering vertex values by hand so I made an OBJ to C++ converter-compressor tool and modelled the objects in Modo.\n The first obvious place to save bytes is to mirror your models whenever possible so the compressor looks for matching mirrored polygons on all 3 dimensions (X,Y,Z) and merge them into mirrored batches.\n This means all I need is 3 bits to tell the decompressor if it has to repeat the poly batch mirrored on X, Y, and/or Z.\n   The engine uses 32bits signed fixed point math in a 16.16 format (16 bits of fraction). This meant 12 bytes per vertex but this is much too wasteful.\n    The trick I used was to encode the vertices as 4bits of significand and a shared 4 bits of exponent, for a total of  2 bytes per vertex.\n Modern GPUs use a similar trick to  encode HDR colors such as RGB9_E5_EXT in OpenGL in only 32bits.\n void VectorUnpack(Fixed *out_v, const uint16_t *v)  {  uint16_t t = pgm_read_word_near(v);  byte e = (t &amp; 0xF) + 8;  int32_t *dst = (int32_t *)out_v;  for(byte i=3; i--;){  int8_t tx = (t &amp; 0xF0);  tx &gt;&gt;= 4;  *dst++ = ((int32_t)tx) &lt;&lt; e;  t &gt;&gt;= 4;  }  }\n This is where the 3D models get butchered by the compressor tool but with careful adjustment of the vertices I could get the models to look fine even after rounding. Beggars can\u2019t be choosers.\n Each poly has a 4bit \u201ccolor\u201d index into a 16 entries palette that maps to 9 different dithering patterns. The indirection allows me to create the pulsing brightness animation and blinking.\n   Usually animations in 3D engines are done using bone matrix transforms with complex bezier curves but this was going to be much too large for this project and the poor little CPU could not have dealt with multiple bone matrices in any reasonable time frame.\n So animations were done using simple vertex interpolation instead. When vertices are only 2 bytes (and mirrored!) it becomes more reasonable for the few meshes that would get animated.\n     All the objects have a scaling value to reuse the meshes and the bounding box was implicitly 1x1x1 centered around the object\u2019s origin. (-0.5 to 0.5) then scaled by the instance\u2019s scaling.\n   You\u2019d think the extra invisible objects would add more bytes than storing bounding boxes, however the extra code complexity necessary to handle multiple bounding boxes of varying sizes and positions per objects out-weights the savings.\n    The game contains a single intro level where elements are gradually introduced to let new players learn the controls.\n   When the game starts only the first few segments of each category can be selected by the RNG.\n   The random number generator is seeded with a constant so the same level gets generated every time to keep the high scores fair.\n   The glyph is first unpacked into an 8\u00d75 buffer (remember the screen is on its side).\n A style buffer tells the text rendering routine how to render the multiple text passes:\n   It seems wasteful but the black outline step takes care of clearing to black so the 2nd pass only needs to invert.\n   To help controlling the game when the frame rate dips the inputs are read 60 times per second (same rate as the game play logic) and stored into a circular buffer so inputs are processed at their input time.\n    Around 50% of the time is spent doing the geometry transforms, another 30% for the clipping.\n I had to write the 16.16 x 16.16 -&gt; 16.16 fixed point multiplication code in assembly to get a decent frame rate.\n The main advantage other than not doing the ridiculously overkill 32 x 32 -&gt; 64 fixed point math in C++ was that I was able to skip some of the long-multiplication steps as 3D vertex*matrix transform has a lot of zero bytes the way the models are rounded off so the assembly code skips an entire (byte * 4 bytes) multiply-accumulate chunk of code for each zero bytes.\n   The fastest routine is the one that does nothing. This was the biggest gain in speed.\n    Download the  .arduboy file (98KB Turbo version) (Classic version:  .arduboy file (100KB) ) to flash the game on your Arduboy.\n Or the  full .zip file with the printable PDF instruction booklet (600KB)\u00a0and contains the .hex file to upload using avrdude or your method of choice.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 06:06:07", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6e38\u620f,\u50cf\u7d20,pixels", "title": "\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u80cc\u540e\uff1aStarduino  -  3D\u572828KB\u4e2d\u7684\u6e38\u620f ", "title_en": "Behind the Pixels: Starduino \u2013 3D Gaming in 28KB", "transed": 1, "url": "http://rv6502.ca/post/2019/01/05/starduino-3d-gaming-in-28kb-behind-the-pixels/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6e38\u620f", "\u50cf\u7d20", "pixels"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "b27d85d88d6a9ea509a2fbca9b507454.jpg", "infoid": 1067845, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7ebd\u7ea6\uff08CNN\u4e1a\u52a1\uff09\u53ef\u53e3\u53ef\u4e50\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u74f6\u5b50\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u7ed9\u7c89\u4e1d\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u4e9b\u590f\u5929\u7684\u4e50\u8da3\u3002\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u5b83\u9047\u5230\u4e86\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u3002\n \u516c\u53f8\uff06\uff0339;\u5236\u4f5c\u60a8\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u63a8\u5e7f\u8ba9\u5ba2\u6237\u5728\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u7126\u74f6\u4e0a\u5199\u77ed\u6d88\u606f\u3002\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u53e3\u53ef\u4e50\uff08CCEP\uff09\u8bd5\u56fe\u963b\u6b62\u4e00\u4e9b\u8bfd\u8c24\u548c\u5546\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u7528\u6237\u5f88\u5feb\u5c31\u4f1a\u53d1\u73b0\u516c\u53f8\uff06\uff0339;

Instead, it met the internet.\n The company&#39;s make-your-own label promotion lets customers write short messages on custom Coke bottles. Although  Coca-Cola   (  CCEP)tried to block some slurs and trademarks, social media users were quick to discover that the company&#39;s restrictions were hardly comprehensive \u2014 and in some cases blocked inoffensive terms.\n For example, &#34; Black Lives Matter,&#34; is blocked. But &#34;White Lives Matter&#34; isn&#39;t. Coke included a special rainbow label  for pride month, but you can&#39;t write &#34;Gay Pride&#34; on the bottle. However, you can write &#34;I hate gays.&#34; &#34;Hitler&#34; and &#34;Nazi&#34; are banned, but users can customize bottles with the phrases, &#34;I am Hitler&#34; or &#34;I am a Nazi.&#34;\n     When the company&#39;s system blocks a word or phrase, a message pops up that reads: &#34;Oops! Looks like the name you requested is not an approved one. Names may not be approved if they&#39;re potentially offensive to other people, trademarked, or celebrity names. We&#39;ve worked hard to get this list right, but sometimes we mess up. If you think this is an error, please contact our Customer Care team. Otherwise, please try again, keep it fun and in the spirit of sharing!&#34;\n   It&#39;s unclear if anyone actually purchased bottles with those custom labels and unlikely that any were produced, but Twitter users picked up on the apparent gaps in the restrictions and tweeted about it.\n  &#34;We&#39;re continuously refining and improving our Share A Coke personalization tool to ensure it is used only for its intended purpose,&#34; a Coca-Cola spokesperson told CNN Business. &#34;Words or phrases that have appeared in the preview mode of the tool may not necessarily be approved, but rather are words we have not previously assessed,&#34; the spokesperson added. &#34;Actual bottles are not made with words that are inconsistent with the program&#39;s intent. We have clarified in the tool&#39;s preview mode that proposed language may require further review.&#34;\n Although companies like Coke should probably be more cautious about launching these types of campaigns, the internet is also notorious for ruining good-natured, corporate outreach. For example, in 2013, JPMorgan started an  ask me anything with the hashtag #AskJPM. It went about as well as you&#39;d expect, with people asking for their foreclosed homes back and cursing out CEO Jamie Dimon.

They&#39;ve pushed for the FCC to continue  defining 25 Mbps as &#34;high use&#34; broadband, and on top of that they overstate the quality of service they provide. A recently-released map of  broadband availability in the US paints a pretty dire picture:\n  Here in St. Louis\u2014where I guess I should count my lucky stars we have &#39;high use&#39; broadband available\u2014I have only two options: I can get &#39;gigabit&#39; cable Internet from Spectrum, or 75 megabit DSL from AT&amp;T.\n   But Spectrum&#39;s &#34;gigabit&#34; Internet is 930 megabits down\u2014in  ideal conditions\u2014but only 40 megabits up. And that&#39;s the highest plan that costs about $150 a month!\n Some would die for those speeds (see the map above), but much of the world is better off. And are you really getting the speeds you pay for? You probably don&#39;t know.\n  Well, I do, thanks to a $35 Raspberry Pi! And you don&#39;t even need a Pi, you could run the software I use on any computer. I just like having a dedicated computer to run all my Internet connection tools, so it&#39;s easy to backup or replace, and it doesn&#39;t get bogged down.\n  I have a video that goes along with this blog post, and it&#39;s embedded below; skip past it if you prefer reading over viewing.\n     I have it installed in a rack (here&#39;s a  video on the Pi rack), but it could just as easily be on my desk, or sitting by my Internet router.\n The most important thing for measuring a network connection is that it&#39;s wired. WiFi, especially on the Pi, fluctuates quite a bit and is terrible for monitoring anything besides maybe WiFi signal strength.\n The Internet Pi runs  Pi-hole for DNS privacy and ad-blocking, and  Prometheus and  Grafana to provide Internet connection monitoring dashboards.\n Having a Pi monitoring my Internet continuously makes it easy to see trends over time, or confirm outages. If you just spot check by running a Speedtest every now and then, you don&#39;t have much data to go on.\n  I built the free and open source  internet-pi project on GitHub. It&#39;s simple to set up, and you can choose which parts of the platform you want to use.\n I set up my Internet Pi from another computer, but you could also run the Internet Pi playbook on the Pi itself. Following the install instructions, you need to have a Pi set up with Raspberry Pi OS running on your network, and be able to SSH into the Pi.\n  Install the Ansible Galaxy content that&#39;s required to make the playbook work:  ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml\n Make copies of the  example.inventory.ini and  example.config.yml files (dropping the  example. from the filenames) and modify them for your own needs\n The playbook installs all the tools you choose in your configuration file, and once that&#39;s done, you should be able to access your Pi&#39;s IP address in a web browser to see Pi-hole, or visit the IP address with the port  :3030 on the end to see the Grafana dashboards.\n   If you wanna use Pi-hole as your home network&#39;s DNS server, you should configure your router to advertise the Pi&#39;s IP address as the primary DNS server for your whole home network. For extra redundancy, you could actually configure two Pis running Pi-hole, but that&#39;s a topic for another post!\n But the great thing is, that allows you to see all the DNS requests your devices are making, and make sure (for the most part) things like so-called &#39;smart&#39; TVs don&#39;t  send tons of information to advertisers.\n Pi-hole is a great  first line of defense for your Internet privacy, at least at home, and it even has some other neat tools like a simple DNS server, if you want to use them.\n  The Internet monitoring dashboard is automatically configured for you, but it can take up to an hour before you start seeing data.\n  In my case, it&#39;s been running for a couple months, so I can see the Internet connection for the past day, week, or even longer!\n The monitoring configuration runs one container that connects to Speedtest.net. Every 30 minutes or so, another container running Prometheus tells the first container to run a speed test.\n NOTE: If you run this monitoring on your own network, be aware that these Speedtest.net checks will consume a good amount of data, especially if you run them more frequently. If you have data caps and want to use this monitoring solution, make sure to modify the check interval so you don&#39;t get an unexpected overage. ISPs, gotta love &#39;em!\n It stores that data on the Pi, and the Grafana dashboard displays it over time. There&#39;s another service that does simple checks on websites you can configure for uptime and HTTP request timing stats\u2014those lightweight checks are performed every few seconds, to give a detailed view when there is more latency in your Internet connection.\n One thing I found interesting was my Cable internet connection\u2014which is  supposed to be one 930 Mbps\u2014is only really about 700 Mbps on average.\n Upload speeds are more consistent, so I begrudgingly pay for this high-tier plan... But I&#39;d be a  lot happier with 50 or 100 Mbps of asymmetric data, since I&#39;m not downloading terabytes of files every day.\n  The main reason I set this stuff up was to compare my Gigabit Cable Internet to SpaceX&#39;s Starlink Internet.\n  I&#39;ll get more into Starlink in a future review, but it looks like on average, when it has a stable connection, I get over 150 Mbps down, and 15 Mbps up, with 40 milliseconds of latency.\n Those numbers  are less than my Cable ISP; but Starlink also costs less\u2014it&#39;s $99/month. And Starlink is also beaming the Internet through satellites up in the sky! For someone who doesn&#39;t have a fast Cable option (like rural customers), that&#39;s a mind-blowing upgrade from dial-up speeds.\n But I mentioned earlier, there&#39;s also a Starlink-specific dashboard that gives all the details you&#39;d normally find in the Starlink App.\n  I haven&#39;t been actively using the Starlink connection today, so it&#39;s a little barren, but it gives a ton of detail, and I&#39;d like to thank Daniel Willcocks ( DanOpsTech) for making this possible; I&#39;m using his Docker image and dashboard, and he even  adjusted it to work on the Raspberry Pi after I asked about it!\n  I also monitor Starlink&#39;s power consumption using a  Shelly Plug US and a  custom Shelly Plug Prometheus exporter I wrote:\n  Starlink&#39;s dish and router use a  lot of power (more than you might expect)\u2014but I&#39;ll discuss more about that in my Starlink review coming soon! I have a  blog post with more about how I set up the Shelly Plug power monitoring.\n  Now I know exactly how much my ISP is fleecing me for Internet. In Spectrum&#39;s case, it looks like they&#39;re only giving me about 3/4ths of what I pay for.\n I wish I could just pay them $110 a month instead of $150, but if I did that, they&#39;d cancel my service!\n I&#39;d like to thank  Max Andersen for the original inspiration for the original monitoring configuration, the developers behind Pi-hole for making it free and open source, and especially  Miguel who maintains the speedtest exporter, for his help  getting some bugs fixed!", "posttime": "2021-06-24 06:05:32", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "raspberry-pi,pi,internet", "title": "\u7528\u8986\u76c6\u5b50pi\u76d1\u63a7\u60a8\u7684\u4e92\u8054\u7f51 ", "title_en": "Monitor Your Internet with a Raspberry Pi", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/monitor-your-internet-raspberry-pi", "via": "", "real_tags": ["pi", "internet"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "24f0551139ef20766f2f404e3654e148.jpg", "infoid": 1067843, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u97f3\u4e50\u5bb6H\u0113ranSoun\u5408\u5e76\u7535\u5f71\u6444\u5f71\u4e0e\u5404\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6570\u5b57\u7f16\u8f91\u3002 \u5728\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u4e2d\u5b8c\u5584\u989c\u8272\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u7531Covid-19\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u73b0\u573a\u827a\u672f\u573a\u6240\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u5927\u9053\u7684\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u53f9\u7684\u5f62\u8c61\u3002 ", "note_en": "Musician H\u0113ran Soun merged film photography with powerful digital editing in Facet.
