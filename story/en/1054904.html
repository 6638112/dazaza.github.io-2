The mathematics needed is not complicated; it&#39;s just basic logic. The word &#34;formal&#34; means the use of a formal language, so that the program logic can be machine checked. Our compilers already tell us if we make a syntax error, or a type error, and they tell us what and where the error is. Formal methods take the next step, telling us if we make a logic error, and they tell us what and where the error is. And they tell us this as we make the error, not after the program is finished. It is good to get any program correct while writing it, rather than waiting for bug reports from users. It is absolutely essential for programs that lives will depend on.  The course begins by introducing (or reviewing) the basic logic that will be used as an aid to programming. Then we look at formal specifications, and how they are refined to become programs. At each refinement step, there is a small theorem to be proven (that the step is correct), so that at the end, the program is correct. Most of the course uses just those programming constructs that are common to most programming languages (assignment statement, if statement, array). We also look at parallel and interacting processes, at probabilistic programming, and functional programming. Along the way, we formally define the language features we use (both execution control and data structures). The emphasis is on program development to meet specifications, and on program modifications that preserve correctness, rather than on verification after a program is finished.  Prerequisites: some programming experience, and some mathematical ability.  The four best motivations for this course are written  here,  here, here,and  here. Read  comments on this course&#39;s formal methods.  Get the course  textbook.Here are  pages 231,..244 in case you would like to print the laws, precedence table, and distributing operators.Here are some  study questions.And here is some tutorial material for  Chapter 1, Chapter 3,and  Chapter 4.Here is an informal explanation of the  one-point laws.Here are the  solutions to the exercises.  This course comes in two versions: for-credit, and not-for-credit.  For-Credit: You must be registered at a university that offers this course. There is a start date and a finish date for the course. There are tests during the term and an exam at the end. The times and places of the tests and exam are set by the university.  Not-For-Credit: You may start the course whenever you like, proceed at your own pace, and finish whenever you like. There are no tests or exams. I would be happy to hear from you, if you don&#39;t mind  emailing me.  Whether you are taking the course for-credit or not-for-credit, it is very valuable for your understanding of the course material to do written exercises (assignments) as you go through the course. With each lecture segment, there is a suggested small exercise or two from the textbook, and there are hundreds more exercises in the textbook for you to choose from. You may work on them by yourself or in a group. In the for-credit version, there is classroom time and an online chat room for students to discuss the exercises and course material with the course instructor and with each other. In the not-for-credit version, you may email questions to  me. If you usea word processor to compose your solutions, here are the  symbols you need. If you choose to typeset your solutions in LaTeX, here is a helpful set of  macros. When you have done an exercise, compare your answer to the  solutiononline. (If you just look up the solution without trying the exercise first, you willnot get the full benefit of the exercise.) Solutions to exercises will not be graded.  There are 34 lectures below for you to watch at your convenience.After each lecture segment listed below, there is a link to the lecture transcript, then the lecture time [minutes:seconds].Finally, there is a suggested exercise or two from the textbook.If you want to print the lecture visuals, here they are: visuals for Chapter 0, visuals for Chapter 1, visuals for Chapter 2, visuals for Chapter 3, visuals for Chapter 4, visuals for Chapter 5, visuals for Chapter 6, visuals for Chapter 7, visuals for Chapter 8, visuals for Chapter 9.You might like to make notes on them while watching the lectures.
