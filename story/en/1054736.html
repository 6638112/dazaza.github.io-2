Its companies were among the first to ask that people work remotely, sending them home with laptops and new software to get the job done. To soften the transition out of the office,  they coddled their workers with perks like subscriptions to meditation apps, UberEats credits, stipends for ergonomic chairs. As months passed, pundits and LinkedInfluencer types wondered if the office had a future at all.</p><p>一年前，虽然美国的人们仍然服用地铁工作，分享电梯和会议室，但硅谷正在排空。它的公司是第一个要求人们远程工作的公司之一，用笔记本电脑和新软件向他们发送回家以完成工作。为了将过渡的过渡从办公室软化出来，他们用冥想应用程序的订阅等额外的工人抄本，Ubereats信用，符合人体工程学椅子的津贴。随着几个月过去，Pundits和LinkedInFluencer类型想知道办公室是否有未来。</p><p> Yet tens of thousands of people in Silicon Valley make a living by keeping those buildings running: cafeteria workers who serve three meals a day, janitors who keep the workspace clean, bus drivers who shuttle employees from San Francisco to the Valley. When tech campuses became ghost towns overnight, that micro-economy collapsed. For many of these workers, the shift to remote work has created more questions than answers, and it has eroded certainty about their future. It’s also created new expectations of what tech companies owe their workers, including those in the shadows of engineers.</p><p> 然而，硅谷的成千上万的人通过保持那些跑的建筑物：自助餐厅工作者每天提供三餐，让工作空间干净，从旧金山穿梭员工到山谷的巴士司机。当科技校园成为鬼城过夜时，微经济崩溃了。对于许多这些工人来说，转向遥远的工作已经创造了比答案更多的问题，而且它对他们的未来有所侵蚀。它也为技术公司欠工人的新期望，包括工程师阴影的公司。</p><p> By the time Nvidia closed its campus in Santa Clara last spring, Marcial Delgado had been working there for nearly 20 years, making his way up from dishwasher to grill cook to lead cook. The Endeavor Café, one of three cafeterias on campus, felt like a second home, and the engineers who came in every day for breakfast and lunch were familiar faces. The second week of March 2020, Delgado got the call, along with the rest of the cafeteria staff, not to come in.</p><p> 当时Nvidia在去年春天在圣克拉拉关闭了校园，Marcial Delgado一直在那里工作了近20年，从洗碗机到烧烤厨师烤架。校园里的三个购物场所之一的努力咖啡馆是第二个家，每天早餐和午餐的工程师都是熟悉的脸。 2020年3月的第二周，德尔加多接到了休息，以及剩下的自助餐厅的工作人员，而不是进来。</p><p>    Delgado retreated to the two-bedroom apartment that he shares with his three young sons. One of his sons has asthma, and Delgado worried about his exposure to the coronavirus. Mostly, he worried about his job. Over the coming months, millions of people across the United States would lose their jobs, as the economy hurtled toward a recession. But Silicon Valley turned out to be something of an oasis. While some tech companies were hurt by the pandemic, many others saw business tick up as the world became more reliant on their products. And some of them—including Nvidia, as well as giants like Facebook and Google—continued to pay their service workers.</p><p>    德尔加多撤退到两卧室公寓，他与三个年轻的儿子分享。他的一个儿子有哮喘，德尔加多担心他接触冠状病毒。主要是，他担心自己的工作。在未来几个月里，随着经济对衰退的影响，美国全体对外的人将失去工作。但硅谷原来是一个绿洲的东西。虽然一些科技公司受到大流行病的伤害，但其他许多其他技术人员认为，当世界变得更加依赖于他们的产品时，许多人看到了商务勾选。他们中的一些 - 包括NVIDIA，以及Facebook和谷歌这样的巨人 - 继续支付他们的服务工作者。</p><p> Delgado has watched friends lose their jobs this year; some have fallen behind on rent payments or  faced evictions. In comparison, he realizes how lucky he is to still have income, and to have the time to focus on his kids, who spent the better part of last year in remote school. The steady paycheck was a relief. So was keeping his employer-provided health insurance, which covers the prescription he takes for high blood pressure and his son’s asthma medication. But the worry never left his mind.</p><p> 德尔加多看着朋友今年失去工作;有些人落后于租金支付或面临的驱逐。相比之下，他意识到他仍然有多幸运，并且有时间专注于他的孩子，他在去年在遥远的学校做得更好。稳定的薪水是一个救济。因此，涵盖了他的雇主提供的健康保险，这些健康保险涵盖他需要高血压和儿子的哮喘药物的处方。但担心从未留下过他的思想。</p><p>  “The pay could end tomorrow,” says Delgado. “You always have a feeling inside of, ‘What’s going to happen? What’s going to happen?’ There’s always anxiety there. You never stop thinking it.”</p><p>  “明天的工资可能会结束，”德尔加多说。 “你总是有一种感觉，'会发生什么？会发生什么？“那里总有焦虑。你永远不会停止思考它。“</p><p>  Homegrown technology companies have created massive wealth in Silicon Valley;  by some estimates, the GDP per capita in San Jose is greater than all but the three richest countries in the world. But the money has also brought challenges. The gulf between rich and poor is enormous, and the cost of living has risen so high that even tech workers making well over six figures feel the crunch. Everyone else is barely scraping by.</p><p>  本土技术公司在硅谷创造了大量的财富;通过一些估计，圣何塞人均国内生产总值大于世界上三个最富有国家的所有人。但这笔钱也带来了挑战。富人和穷人之间的海湾是巨大的，生活成本已经上升，即使是技术人员在六个数字上越来越多地感受到了紧缩。其他人都几乎没有刮伤。 </p><p> The region’s large corporate campuses are supported by a small army of workers, most of whom are not directly employed by the tech companies but by staffing firms. Delgado, for example, is employed by Bon Appetit, a food service company that contracts with Nvidia. While the jobs pay more than California’s minimum wage, they’re still considered low-wage work: At the tech companies, subcontracted workers make 70 percent less than equivalent full-time employees, according to  research from UC Santa Cruz. And the value of that wage doesn’t go as far in Silicon Valley as it might elsewhere: In Santa Clara, where Delgado lives, the cost of housing has risen exponentially since he moved there decades ago, following his brother from Jalisco. Now, he says, about 70 percent of his income goes toward paying the rent.</p><p>该地区的大型企业校园得到了一位小军工人的支持，其中大多数人都没有由科技公司直接雇用，而是由人员配置公司。例如，德尔加多是由与NVIDIA合同的食品服务公司的Bon Appetit雇用。据UC Santa Cruz的研究，虽然工作仍然被认为是低工资的工作：在技术公司，分包工人比同等的全职员工减少70％。而这一工资的价值在其他地方可能不会在硅谷上往往：在德拉多的生活中，在德拉戈的生活中，由于他在那里搬到了几十年前，房屋成本呈指数级呈指数级，追随他的兄弟jalisco。现在，他说，大约70％的收入达到了租金。</p><p> In the pandemic, that’s added new anxiety for the lower-wage workers in Silicon Valley. One month without pay can very easily spiral into losing housing, the ability to put food on the table, the loss of the ground beneath their feet. “There’s a lot of fear,” says Maria Noel Fernandez, the director of organizing and civic engagement for Working Partnerships USA, a Silicon Valley labor organization. “There’s a sentiment that there’s a ticking clock. When will their lives be completely thrown apart?”</p><p> 在大流行中，这对硅谷的较低工资工作者增加了新的焦虑。一个月没有薪水可以很容易地螺旋到失去的房屋中，能够将食物放在桌子上，脚下的落地丢失。 “有很多恐惧，”硅谷劳动组织的组织和公民参与主任Maria Noel Fernandez说。 “有一个情绪，有一个滴答的时钟。他们的生活何时完全被抛出？“</p><p> Alma Cardenas had been bracing for her life to be thrown apart since March. For six years, Cardenas had worked as a barista at Verizon’s hub in San Jose, where she made drinks for the campus’s 3,400 employees. When the pandemic began, Verizon closed its offices. The company continued to pay its subcontractors, like many of the other tech companies nearby, but Cardenas knew the next paycheck was never guaranteed. “Not knowing what would happen next month, or even how to manage that worry—it caused a lot of depression for me,” she says.</p><p> 阿尔玛Cardenas一直在为她的生命支撑，以来自3月以来将被抛出。六年来，Cardenas在圣何塞的Verizon Hub中曾担任咖啡师，在那里她为校园的3,400名员工制作了饮品。当大流行开始时，Verizon封闭了其办事处。公司继续支付其分包商，如附近的许多其他科技公司，但Cardenas知道下一个薪水从未保证过。 “不知道下个月会发生什么，甚至如何管理这个担心 - 它对我带来了很多抑郁症，”她说。</p><p> In September, Cardenas got the news she’d feared. Her supervisor called to ask for her email, so that she could send Cardenas an official layoff letter. Verizon had ended contracts with 120 of its cafeteria workers. Her last paycheck would come just a few days later. Her health insurance was supposed to end too, but Cardenas’s union, Local 19, fought to keep those benefits for a few more months, until December 2020.</p><p> 9月，Cardenas得到了她担心的新闻。她的主管呼吁询问她的电子邮件，以便她可以发送Cardenas官方裁员信。 Verizon结束了120家自助餐厅的合同。她最后几天后的薪水会来。她的健康保险也应该结束，但Cardenas的联盟，当地的19岁的工会致力于保持这些福利几个月，直到2020年12月。</p><p> Cardenas lives with her two daughters, ages 16 and 21, in an RV in San Jose. They don’t have a lot of personal space, and everyone’s mental health has suffered in the past year while they’ve been cooped up inside. Cardenas filed for unemployment. Her younger daughter took a part-time job at a nearby McDonald’s to pitch in. It’s still a struggle to make ends meet. While Cardenas looks for new work, she’s doing some volunteering to help people schedule their vaccine appointments. It keeps her mind off of her fears about what’s next.</p><p> Cardenas住在她的两个女儿，16岁和21岁，在圣何塞的一个RV。他们没有很多个人空间，而每个人的心理健康在过去的一年里遭受了困扰，而他们已经在里面有了。 Cardenas提起失业。她的年轻女儿在附近的麦当劳兼职工作，以促销。仍然是一个努力，使他们结束遇到。虽然Cardenas寻找新的工作，但她正在做一些志愿者来帮助人们安排他们的疫苗约会。它让她的思绪偏离了她对接下来的事情的恐惧。</p><p> “I have friends who work for Google and Facebook, and they continue to receive pay. They still have health insurance.”</p><p> “我有朋友为谷歌和Facebook工作，他们继续收到薪水。他们还有健康保险。“</p><p> Cardenas knows her situation isn’t unique. By May of last year, more than  20 million Americans were unemployed. For immigrants and people without a college degree, the rates of unemployment were especially high. The economy has bounced back somewhat since then, but in what some experts are calling  a K-shaped recovery: One half of the US is doing OK or better financially, while the other half is falling even further behind. But Cardenas doesn’t understand why Verizon, which ended the year with  $31 billion in revenue and dazzling fourth-quarter cash flow, couldn’t afford to keep her on the payroll.</p><p> 卡登斯知道她的情况并不是独一无二的。到去年5月，未失业率超过2000万美国人。对于未经大学学位的移民和人民，失业率特别高。从那时起，经济已经有所反弹，但在一些专家呼吁K形恢复：美国的一半是在经济上做得好或更好的财务状况，而另一半则在落后进一步下降。但卡登斯并不明白为什么verizon以310亿美元的收入和耀眼的第四季度现金流量结束，这不起将她纳入工资单。 </p><p>  Over the summer, Verizon’s CEO, Hans Vestberg, had announced a job training program to prepare lower-wage workers for new careers. “Verizon, as a large corporation, needs to take actions and be responsible here,” Vestberg said at the time. “Large corporations have far bigger impacts than governments even, sometimes. We feel that responsibility as a corporation.” Cardenas wondered where Verizon saw its responsibility now. (Verizon did not respond to a request for comment.) If the company was doing so well, she wondered why it couldn’t share the wealth. And when she looked across Silicon Valley, she wished she’d had the foresight to work somewhere else.</p><p>夏天，Verizon的首席执行官汉斯Vestberg宣布了一项职业培训计划，为新职业制定较低工资的工人。 “verizon作为一个大公司，需要采取行动并在这里负责，”Vestberg当时说。 “甚至有时候，大公司的影响甚至比政府更大。我们觉得责任为公司。“ Cardenas想知道Verizon现在看到其责任。 （Verizon没有回复评论请求。）如果公司在做得很好，她想知道为什么它不能分享财富。当她看着硅谷时，她希望她在其他地方工作了。</p><p>  “I have friends who work for Google and Facebook, and they continue to receive pay. They still have health insurance,” she says. “I don’t know what else to say about that.”</p><p>  “我有朋友为谷歌和Facebook工作，他们继续收到薪水。他们仍然有健康保险，“她说。 “我不知道还有什么要说的。”</p><p> Silicon Valley’s major tech companies already operated like small cities, municipalities in miniature. Their corporate campuses have gyms, day cares, barbershops, arcades, cafeterias, and bars. They even have their own bus systems. In the pandemic, many of them have acted even more like a government, offering job security and health benefits to the most vulnerable workers, even while they aren’t working.</p><p> Silicon Valley的主要科技公司已经像小城市一样经营，在微型城市。他们的公司校园有健身房，日子，理发店，拱廊，自助餐厅和酒吧。他们甚至有自己的公交系统。在大流行中，他们中的许多人都像政府一样，即使他们不工作）也向最脆弱的工人提供工作保障和健康福利。</p><p> Doing so has “raised huge philosophical questions,” says Russell Hancock, the president of Joint Venture Silicon Valley, a think tank in the region. “There is a sentiment that these companies are so big, so rich, that they’re under a moral obligation to do something with all of that wealth. We’ve come to feel that, as a society, we have these expectations of corporations. Are these expectations realistic and fair?”</p><p> 在该地区的智库合资硅谷总裁Russell Hancock说，“提出了巨大的哲学问题”。 “有一种情绪表明这些公司如此大，富裕，他们是在道德义务与所有财富做某事。我们已经觉得，作为一个社会，我们有这些公司的期望。这些期望是现实和公平的吗？“</p><p> Companies have offered workers benefits like health insurance for decades—but doing so has largely put the onus on companies, not the government, to provide basic services to Americans. That companies like Google, Apple, and Facebook have continued to pay their subcontractors is a similar case. The benefit is appreciated by those who receive it, but it’s distributed unevenly. Hancock points out that not every corporation can afford to support workers whose jobs have become redundant, nor should the public expect them to. “Most people would say, that’s the role for government.”</p><p> 公司已经提供了几十年来健康保险的工人福利 - 但这已经在很大程度上为公司而不是政府提供了向美国人提供基本服务的责任。那种像谷歌，Apple和Facebook这样的公司继续支付他们的分包商是一个类似的案例。那些收到它的人感谢福利，但它不均匀地分发。汉考克指出，并非每个公司都可以支持工作人员已经变得多余的工人，也不应该向公众期望他们。 “大多数人会说，这是政府的作用。”</p><p>  For those who have benefited, though, the support from tech companies has provided more stability, and more income, than unemployment from the government. Liliana Morales is a prep cook in the Facebook cafeteria, where she worked for six years until the campus shut down last spring. On March 15, Flagship—the food service provider that contracts with Facebook—told everyone to go home, and “not to worry about our pay,” says Morales. “They told us we were going to continue to be paid and continue to have our health insurance.”</p><p>  然而，对于那些受益的人，科技公司的支持提供了更多的稳定，更多的收入，而不是政府的失业。 Liliana Morales是在Facebook自助餐厅的准备烹饪，在那里她工作了六年，直到校园停在去年春天。 3月15日，旗舰 - 与Facebook合同的食品服务提供商 - 告诉大家回家，并“不担心我们的工资”，说道。 “他们告诉我们我们将继续支付并继续进行健康保险。”</p><p>  Most of her last year has been spent focusing on her kids, ages 13, 10, and 6. Other single parents have had to make impossible choices in the past year:  your kids or your job. Morales never had to make such a decision. When her kids schools’ shut down, she pivoted to helping them adjust to remote school. It was still a challenge. She had issues with the Wi-Fi at home, and her kids struggled to pay attention. “It’s hard when you have little kids and they are in their classes and they cannot focus, because they need to go to the bathroom, they need to eat something, they’re not watching the iPad,” she says. “I have to be sitting down with the youngest one and trying to look after the other two, to see if they’re watching.” Morales isn’t sure how she could’ve done that if she’d also had to work at Facebook every day.</p><p>  她的大多数人去年都在关注她的孩子，13岁，10岁，和6岁。其他单一的父母在过去一年中必须做出不可能的选择：你的孩子或你的工作。莫拉莱斯从未做出这样的决定。当她的孩子学校关闭时，她枢转了帮助他们待在遥远的学校。这仍然是一个挑战。她在家里有了Wi-Fi问题，她的孩子们努力注意。 “当你有小孩而且他们在他们的课程中，他们不能专注的时候很难，因为他们需要去洗手间，他们需要吃点东西，他们没有看着iPad，”她说。 “我必须坐下最年轻的人，试图照顾其他两个，看看他们是否正在观看。”莫拉莱斯不确定她如何完成，如果她每天也必须在Facebook上班。 </p><p> Morales’ kids went back to in-person learning in early 2021. But while Facebook’s campus remains closed, she has another job: She’s the shop steward for  Unite Here! Local 19, a union that represents cafeteria, hotel, and airport workers in Silicon Valley. Not everyone in the union has kept their job, which has sent Morales into overdrive supporting in every way that she can. Two or three days a week, she has meetings with the union to coordinate support, organizing trainings for people to learn new skills while they’re out of work. She’s helped people fill out their unemployment forms correctly, and helped people prepare job applications. She also volunteers at the union’s food distribution center, where she can help people get something to eat who haven’t been quite so lucky.</p><p>2021年初，莫拉莱斯的孩子们回到了人们的学习。但是，虽然Facebook的校园仍然被关闭，但她还有另一份工作：她是在这里统一的商店管家！地方19，代表自助餐厅，酒店和硅谷的机场工人的工会。不是联盟中的每个人都保留了他们的工作，这使得莫拉莱斯派出了过度的支持，以至于她可以。每周两三天，她与联盟会议协调支持，为人们组织培训，以在他们失业的同时学习新技能。她帮助人们正确填写失业形式，并帮助人们准备工作申请。她还在联盟的食品配送中心志愿者，在那里她可以帮助人们吃东西，谁没有太幸运。</p><p> Most importantly, though, the union has given Morales and the cafeteria workers at Facebook some much-needed relief after a tense year. Earlier this year, the union negotiated a deal with Facebook to guarantee pay to its cafeteria workers throughout 2021, with health benefits, regardless of whether or not the campus reopens. “So we don’t have to worry,” says Morales. “I’m very thankful for that.”</p><p> 但是，最重要的是，联盟在Facebook上赋予了德国和自助餐厅工作者，在紧张的一年后一些需要的救济。今年早些时候，联盟与Facebook谈判达成协议，以保证2021年的自助餐厅工作人员，以及校园是否重新打开。 “所以我们不必担心，”莫拉莱斯说。 “我非常感谢。”</p><p>  Working Partnerships USA is pushing for more workers in Silicon Valley to have paycheck assurance, as well as health care. “These companies are thriving in the pandemic,” says Fernandez. “This is not your local nail salon. It’s not the same as a restaurant that’s really struggling.” In the last year, companies like Amazon and Instacart have  come under fire for how they treat their essential workers, leading to  employee protests and  public backlash. “How do we take the energy of saying, ‘Workers are essential’—which was the thing to say last year—and then actually have some teeth behind that?” says Fernandez.</p><p>  工作合作伙伴关系美国正在推动硅谷的更多工人，以获得薪水保证，以及医疗保健。 “这些公司在大流行中蓬勃发展，”Fernandez说。 “这不是你当地的钉子沙龙。它与一家真正挣扎的餐厅不一样。“在去年，像亚马逊和Instacart这样的公司因他们如何对待他们的基本工人而导致员工抗议和公共反对的公司。 “我们如何掌握谚语，”工人是至关重要的 - 去年这是什么意思 - 然后落后于此牙齿？“ Fernandez说。</p><p> Now that some companies are planning to reopen, there are new concerns. While companies like Facebook and Google have expanded their footprint in the past year, doubling down on their commitment to operate big campuses, others have reconsidered the value of offices. Others, like Nvidia, have left the question open; Jensen Huang, the CEO, has said that he has  no problem with his employees working from home forever. If enough employees work from home, a company like Nvidia might not need a cafeteria anymore.</p><p> 现在有些公司计划重新开放，有新的问题。虽然Facebook和谷歌这样的公司在过去一年中扩大了他们的足迹，但在他们的致力于运营大型校区的致力下，却加倍偏离办公室的价值。其他人，如nvidia，已经揭开了问题;首席执行官Jensen Huang表示，他的员工永远没有任何问题。如果足够的员工在家工作，那么像NVIDIA这样的公司可能不再需要自助餐厅。</p><p> For Delgado, that possibility is concerning. But recently, he made his return to Nvidia’s Endeavor Café. The company had reopened it as a prep station to make meals for charity, and had invited workers to come back in for half-shifts. Everyone works with masks on, spaced 6 feet apart, but it’s still nice to be doing something useful again. They only work part of the day, but they still receive their full paychecks. Delgado doesn’t know when Nvidia is going to have their employees come back into the office, or when he’ll start cooking for them again. He doesn’t even know if he’s going to still have a job by the end of 2021. But being back in the cafeteria, for now, feels like comfort. It’s a place that tethers him to something normal, to a time when he wasn’t always looking over his shoulder for the next piece of bad news.</p><p> 对于德拉多，这种可能性就是关于。但最近，他回到了Nvidia的努力咖啡馆。该公司重新打开了它作为慈善膳食的准备站，并邀请工人回到半班位。每个人都与面具合作，分开6英尺，但仍然很好地做一些有用的东西。他们只在一天中工作，但他们仍然收到他们的完整薪水。德尔加多不知道NVIDIA将何时将员工回到办公室，或者当他再次开始为他们烹饪时。他甚至不知道他是否将在2021年底之前仍然有一项工作。但是回到自助餐厅，现在感觉就像舒适。这是一个让他到正常的东西的地方，到了他并不总是看着下一篇坏消息的时间。</p><p>   🏃🏽‍♀️ Want the best tools to get healthy?
