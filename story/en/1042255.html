He found a job as a clerk at the local PriceRite, began saving money and made plans to marry his fiancé.</p><p> 帕克斯两次因贩毒被定罪，并在监狱里度过了六年时间。他在当地的PriceRite找到一份工作，开始存钱，并计划与未婚夫结婚。</p><p>  So when police last year filed numerous charges against Parks stemming from a shoplifting incident at a Woodbridge hotel in which the suspect hit a police car before fleeing the scene, the ex-convict who had worked eagerly to repair his life, tried just as hard to clear his name.</p><p>  因此，当警察去年在伍德布里奇酒店因入店行窃事件而对公园提出多项指控时，犯罪嫌疑人在逃离现场前撞上了警车，这位前急于修复自己生命的前犯人也竭尽全力。清除他的名字。</p><p>  “I had no idea what this was about. I’d never been to Woodbridge before, didn’t even know for sure where it was,” Parks told NJ Advance Media last week.</p><p>  “我不知道这是怎么回事。我以前从未去过伍德布里奇，甚至不知道它在哪里。”帕克斯上周对NJ Advance Media说。</p><p>  “I’ve never even been to Middlesex County besides going to a Rutgers University football game,” Parks said.</p><p>  帕克斯说：“除了参加罗格斯大学的足球比赛，我什至从未去过米德尔塞克斯郡。”</p><p>  Parks didn’t drive a car, didn’t have a license and had to ask his cousin to drive him to the Woodbridge police station, after he learned police had a warrant for his arrest.</p><p>  帕克斯（Parks）得知警察有逮捕令后，没有开车，没有执照，还不得不请堂兄开车将他送到伍德布里奇警察局。 </p><p>  Moments after he arrived, he said, he was in handcuffs and later confronted by detectives who told him repeatedly, “You know what you did.”</p><p>他说，到达后不久，他被戴上手铐，后来遭到侦探的袭击，他们反复告诉他：“你知道你做了什么。”</p><p>  Before everything was over, Parks would spend 10 days in jail, all of his life savings, and the next year fighting to clear his name.</p><p>  在一切都结束之前，帕克斯将在监狱里度过10天，挽救他一生的全部积蓄，并在第二年争取清除他的名字。</p><p>  Parks attorney, Daniel Sexton of Jersey City, filed suit against the township, the police department and public officials, including Mayor John McCormac, alleging investigators violated his clients rights by relying on facial recognition software that has since been banned by the state.</p><p>  公园律师，泽西市的丹尼尔·塞克斯顿（Daniel Sexton）对该镇，警察局和包括约翰·麦考马克（John McCormac）市长在内的公共官员提起诉讼，指控调查人员依靠该州禁止的面部识别软件侵犯了其客户的权利。</p><p>  A spokesman for the mayor said the township had not yet seen the civil complaint and could not comment.</p><p>  市长发言人说，该镇尚未看到民事申诉，因此无法发表评论。</p><p>     Investigators relied on facial recognition software that has since been banned in New Jersey to identify Parks as a suspect in crimes that occurred the afternoon of Jan. 26, 2019, at the Hampton Inn hotel on Route 9 North in Woodbridge.</p><p>     调查人员依靠面部识别软件，该软件自2019年1月26日下午在伍德布里奇北部9号公路的汉普顿酒店（Hampton Inn）旅馆被新泽西州禁止使用，以将公园确定为犯罪嫌疑人。</p><p>  The software, which was created by Clearview Al, was criticized for its heavy reliance on billions of social media photos to identify criminal suspects.</p><p>  由Clearview Al创建的该软件因严重依赖数十亿社交媒体照片来识别犯罪嫌疑人而受到批评。</p><p>  According to court documents obtained by NJ Advance Media, the suspect shoplifted candy and other snacks from the hotel gift shop and darted into a men’s room after a hotel staffer called police.</p><p>  根据NJ Advance Media获得的法院文件，犯罪嫌疑人从旅馆礼品店偷走了糖果和其他零食，并在旅馆工作人员打电话报警后冲入男子的房间。 </p><p>  When two officers arrived, the man handed over a driver’s license from Tennessee identifying him as Jamal Owens.</p><p>当两名军官到达时，该男子从田纳西州移交了驾照，将其识别为贾马尔·欧文斯。</p><p>  But police ran the name through the computer in the patrol car and determined the license was not valid and possibly fraudulent, according to the report.</p><p>  报告称，但是警察通过巡逻车中的计算机运行了这个名字，并确定了执照是无效的并且可能是欺诈性的。</p><p>  When the police pulled out their handcuffs to arrest the man, he fled out the back door of the hotel, losing a sneaker on the way.</p><p>  当警察拉出手铐逮捕该男子时，他逃离了酒店的后门，途中丢失了运动鞋。</p><p>  Outside, the man jumped into a black Dodge Challenger as officers drew their firearms and told him to stop, but he took off, causing an officer to jump out of the way, the report states.</p><p>  报道说，在外面，当警察拉出枪支并告诉他停止时，该男子跳进了黑色的道奇挑战者，但他起飞了，导致一名警察跳开了。</p><p>  He crashed into the back of a patrol car and a column outside the hotel before speeding out onto Route 9, an officer wrote.</p><p>  一名警官写道，在撞上9号公路之前，他撞上了一辆巡逻车的后座和旅馆外面的一列。</p><p>  One of the officers followed the car, but lost sight of it. The vehicle was later found abandoned in a Woodbridge parking lot.</p><p>  一名警官跟着汽车，但看不见它。后来发现这辆车被遗弃在伍德布里奇停车场。</p><p>   The day after the hotel crimes, investigators in New York and New Jersey notified Woodbridge police they had a “high profile” match to the photo, after running it through a facial recognition system that compares the image to photos of other suspects, such as ex-convicts, whose pictures were on file in police and FBI databases.</p><p>   旅馆犯罪发生的第二天，纽约和新泽西的调查人员通过面部识别系统将照片与其他嫌疑人的照片（例如前者）进行比较后，通知伍德布里奇警方他们对这张照片进行了“高调”匹配-罪犯，其照片记录在警察和FBI数据库中。 </p><p>  The suspect was identified as Parks and warrants were issued in his name, charging him with numerous offenses including shoplifting, false government document and resisting arrest. He was later charged with aggravated assault with a weapon, a weapons offense and leaving the scene of an accident.</p><p>该嫌疑人被确定为公园，并以他的名义签发了逮捕令，指控他犯有许多罪行，包括入店行窃，伪造政府文件和拒捕。后来他被指控以武器加重殴打，武器犯罪和离开事故现场的罪名。</p><p>  Police said they checked several addresses in Paterson in an attempt to arrest Parks, but couldn’t find him.</p><p>  警方说，他们在帕特森检查了几个地址，试图逮捕帕克斯，但找不到他。</p><p>     On Jan. 30, 2019, Parks received a troubling call from his grandmother. Police officers had been to her Paterson home and said they had a warrant for his arrest, according to his lawsuit.</p><p>     2019年1月30日，帕克斯收到了祖母打来的电话。根据他的诉讼，警察曾到她的帕特森家，并说他们有逮捕他的逮捕令。</p><p>  A few days later, Parks asked his cousin to drive him to Woodbridge “in order to clear up what he knew to be a matter of mistaken identity,” the lawsuit says.</p><p>  几天后，帕克斯要求他的堂兄将他驱赶到伍德布里奇，“目的是要弄清他所知道的与身份错误有关的事情，”诉讼称。</p><p>  As his cousin waited in the car outside for four hours, Parks said he spoke with the front desk officer in an attempt to clear his name, but was soon approached by multiple officers.</p><p>  当他的堂兄在外面的车里等了四个小时时，帕克斯说他曾与前台官员交谈，试图清除他的名字，但很快被多名官员接近。</p><p>  “They handcuffed me, then they took me to the interrogation room. A little room,” Parks said. “They arrested me before the interview. They already had in mind they were arresting me.”</p><p>  “他们给我戴上手铐，然后带我到审讯室。一个小房间，”帕克斯说。 “他们在面试之前逮捕了我。他们已经想到要逮捕我。”</p><p>  Inside, police showed him photos of the damaged Dodge Challenger and kept saying “You know what you did,” according to Parks.</p><p>  帕克斯说，在室内，警察给他看了受损道奇挑战者的照片，并一直说“你知道你做了什么”。 </p><p>  He asked for a lawyer, then was taken to a hallway where he was handcuffed to a bench. About an hour later, the officers – he counted seven – told him they were going to take him to a different room for more questions.</p><p>他要了律师，然后被带到走廊，他被铐在长凳上。大约一个小时后，军官们（他数了7个）告诉他，他们将把他带到另一个房间来询问更多问题。</p><p>  The lawsuit states that the room where they wanted to take him for additional questioning didn’t have any cameras and that Parks grew fearful for his safety.</p><p>  诉讼指出，他们想带他进一步询问的房间没有任何摄像头，帕克斯对他的安全越来越担心。</p><p>  Parks said he feigned an asthma attack. After a brief emergency room visit, he was lodged in the Middlesex County Jail, where he said he remained for the next 10 days before posting bail.</p><p>  帕克斯说他假装患有哮喘。在短暂的急诊室探视之后，他被关押在米德尔塞克斯县监狱，他说他将在接下来的十天里呆在保释金上。</p><p>  He said after speaking with his fiancé, they decided to drain their joint savings bank account and pay an attorney $7,500 to take the case to trial.</p><p>  他说，在与未婚夫交谈后，他们决定耗尽他们的共同储蓄银行帐户，并支付7500美元的律师费，以便对该案进行审判。</p><p>  The Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office offered Parks a deal: In exchange for a guilty plea, he would serve six years in prison with no early release until he’d served 85 percent of his sentence. He would also be on parole for three years after his release.</p><p>  米德尔塞克斯郡检察官办公室向帕克斯提供了一笔交易：作为认罪的交换，他将被判入狱6年，不及早释放，直到他服完85％的刑期为止。释放后，他还将在假释期三年。</p><p>  If he went to trial, the prosecutor intended to seek a sentence of 20 years or more based on his previous criminal history, Parks said.</p><p>  帕克斯说，如果他接受审判，检察官打算根据他以前的犯罪记录寻求20年或更长时间的判决。</p><p>  “I did have a background, but I’d been home since 2016 and I had been in no trouble,” Parks said.</p><p>  帕克斯说：“我确实有背景，但自2016年以来我就一直在家里，而且我没有遇到任何麻烦。” </p><p>  “The whole thing scared the living heck out of me. I’ve been trying to do the right thing with my life,” he said.</p><p>“整个事情使我感到生怕。我一直在努力做正确的事，”他说。</p><p>  After three or four court appearances over a year, Parks said a Superior Court judge began pressuring the prosecutor’s office to produce more evidence in the case beyond just the facial recognition software.</p><p>  一年多的三到四次出庭后，帕克斯说，高等法院的法官开始向检察官办公室施压，要求其提供更多的证据，而不仅仅是面部识别软件。</p><p>  “She told them she didn’t want to come back to court until they had solid evidence,” Parks said. A few months after that hearing, Parks said he received a letter from the prosecutor’s office dismissing the charges.</p><p>  帕克斯说：“她告诉他们，在他们有确凿的证据之前，她不愿再次出庭。”聆讯几个月后，帕克斯说他收到了检察官办公室的一封信，驳回了这些指控。</p><p>   Parks’ attorney argues that police and prosecutors — armed with only the facial recognition evidence from New York-based company  Clearview Al — relentlessly pursued his client for nearly a year.</p><p>   帕克斯的律师辩称，警察和检察官只带着来自纽约公司Clearview Al的面部识别证据，就狠狠地追捕了他的客户近一年。</p><p>  The software was used in the  arrests of 19 men in New Jersey who police say tried to lure children for sex. Earlier this year, however, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal  ordered police and prosecutors to stop using the facial recognition technology after questions were raised about how the company receives and protects its data.</p><p>  该软件在新泽西州逮捕了19名男子，警察称他们试图引诱儿童做爱。但是，在有关公司如何接收和保护数据的问题引起质疑之后，新泽西州司法部长古尔伯·格鲁瓦尔（Gurbir Grewal）于今年早些时候命令警察和检察官停止使用面部识别技术。</p><p>  According to the attorney general’s office, in January Attorney General Gurbir Grewal announced a moratorium on using Clearview AI in law enforcement investigations, while the Division of Criminal Justice evaluated both Clearview AI and other facial recognition products, and developed a policy governing the use of this technology and specific products. That evaluation and review continues and the moratorium remains in place.</p><p>  根据总检察长办公室的说法，总检察长古尔伯·格鲁瓦尔（Gurbir Grewal）于1月宣布暂停在执法调查中使用Clearview AI，而刑事司法部则对Clearview AI和其他面部识别产品进行了评估，并制定了管理使用此方法的政策。技术和特定产品。评估和审查仍在继续，并且暂停执行仍然有效。</p><p>  According to the Clearview Al, comparisons are made when the software pulls photos from the “open web” such as public social media accounts, adding millions of faces to the database every day.</p><p>  根据Clearview Al的说法，当软件从“开放式网络”（例如公共社交媒体帐户）中提取照片并每天向数据库中添加数百万张面孔时，就会进行比较。 </p><p>  The combination of people dumping personal information online and a general lack of regulation threatens people’s ability to walk outside without being watched, Helen Nissenbaum, an information sciences professor at Cornell Tech,  told NJ Advance Media earlier this year.</p><p>康奈尔科技大学的信息科学教授海伦·尼森鲍姆（Helen Nissenbaum）今年早些时候对NJ Advance Media表示，人们在网上倾倒个人信息以及普遍缺乏法规，这威胁到人们无视他人走出去的能力。</p><p>  The use of facial recognition to identify people in public is “not compatible with a free society,” she said.</p><p>  她说，使用面部识别来识别公众人物“与自由社会不兼容”。</p><p>    “The mistaken identity was solely based on facial recognition software that is illegal in the state now and was always known to be faulty,” the attorney said.</p><p>    律师说：“错误的身份完全是基于面部识别软件，该软件在该州目前是非法的，并且一直被认为是有缺陷的。”</p><p>  “No actual evidence supported the charges against my client,” Sexton said in an interview with NJ Advance Media. “No fingerprints or DNA, no blood type.”</p><p>  Sexton在接受NJ Advance Media采访时说：“没有实际证据支持对我的客户的指控。” “没有指纹或DNA，没有血型。”</p><p>  Sexton filed the complaint as a civil rights lawsuit, blaming “anti-black animus (as) a substantial motivating factor leading to the wrongful” arrest.</p><p>  塞克斯顿（Sexton）将该申诉作为民权诉讼提起诉讼，指责“反黑人动因是导致不法逮捕的重大诱因”。</p><p>  “Racial profiling is considered to be an equal protection claim, essentially that (Parks) was detained, arrested and charged primarily because he is or appears racially African-American,” the suit states.</p><p>  该诉讼指出：“种族貌相被认为是一项平等的保护主张，本质上是（Parks）被拘留，逮捕和起诉主要是因为他是种族或非裔美国人。”</p><p>  The suit also claims excessive force, false imprisonment and cruel and unusual punishment, and seeks compensatory and punitive damages for physical and emotional pain and suffering.</p><p>  该诉讼还要求用力过度，错误监禁，残忍和不寻常的惩罚，并要求对身体和情感上的痛苦和苦难进行补偿和惩罚性赔偿。 </p><p>  In addition to Woodbridge police officers, Parks is suing the police director, the township’s mayor, the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office and the county jail.</p><p>除了伍德布里奇的警察外，帕克斯还起诉了警察局长，镇长，米德尔塞克斯县检察官办公室和县监狱。</p><p>  None of those named as defendants in the lawsuit have responded to requests for comments.</p><p>  在诉讼中被指定为被告的人中没有一个回应置评请求。</p><p>  Thank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.
