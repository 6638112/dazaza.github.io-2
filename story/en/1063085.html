The concierge was occupied with a pair of Japanese tourists visiting the apartment, which had been home to the surrealist painter René Magritte and his wife, Georgette Berger, from 1930 until 1954, and was now a private museum. It was shortly after 10 a.m. on September 24, 2009. When she excused herself to answer the door, the concierge found two young men waiting at the threshold. One of them asked if visiting hours had begun; the other placed a pistol against her head and forced his way inside.</p><p>在布鲁塞尔郊区的杰特最适合排列的135 rue esseeghem，rue esseghem rang。礼宾部门占据了一对日本游客，前往公寓，该公寓一直是超现实主义画家雷诺Magritte和他的妻子Georgette Berger，从1930年到1954年，现在是一个私人博物馆。这是在2009年9月24日晚上10点之后的。当她抛弃自己回答门时，看门人发现了两名年轻人等待在门槛上等待。其中一个人问去参观时间是否已经开始;另一个让一只手枪放在她的头上并迫使他的方式迫使他的方式。</p><p>  The armed men quickly rounded up both tourists and the three staff members on duty, leaving them kneeling in the museum’s small courtyard, where Magritte had hosted weekly gatherings for painters, musicians, and intellectuals. With the hostages out of their way, one of the thieves jumped the glass partition protecting the tiny museum’s centerpiece:  Olympia, a 1948 portrait of the late artist’s wife, pictured nude with a seashell resting on her stomach. The painting measured 60 by 80 centimeters and was estimated to be worth 2 million euros. Belgian police arrived within minutes, summoned by an alarm triggered by the removal of the painting. But by that time, the thieves had returned to a getaway car that sped off toward the neighboring suburb of Laeken.</p><p>  武装人员迅速围绕着名游客和三名工作人员，让他们跪在博物馆的小院，Magritte举办了一周的画家，音乐家和知识分子。随着人质的方式，其中一个盗贼跳起了玻璃隔断，保护了微小的博物馆的核心：奥林匹亚，1948年的后期艺术家的妻子的肖像，用腹部休息的贝壳画了裸体。绘画测量了60厘米80厘米，估计价值200万欧元。比利时警察在几分钟之内到达，因删除绘画而引发的警报召唤。但到那个时候，盗贼又回到了一个朝向邻近的Laeken郊区的度假汽车。</p><p>  It was uncommon in those days for small museums to bother installing surveillance cameras, so police had to rely on sketches of the two suspects, who appeared to be in their 20s. Interpol described one suspect as short, of Asian descent, and an English speaker, while the other was described as a bit taller, of European or North African descent, and a French speaker. Brazen as it was, the robbery seemed to be the work of professionals—a daring, high-value heist carried out with speed and precision by men who knew how to handle weapons, how to deal effectively with hostages, and how quickly to expect a police response. They had also been clever about selecting their target. Magritte, whose surrealist paintings influenced the work of Ed Ruscha, Andy Warhol, and Jasper Johns, is a national treasure in Belgium, where a number of museums display his work. But the thieves had avoided larger, more secure metropolitan museums in favor of one exceptionally valuable painting from the artist’s former home, open only by appointment, leaving slim chance they would arrive to find it packed with more visitors than they could manage.</p><p>  在那些小博物馆打扰安装监控摄像机的那些日子里，这是不常见的，因此警方必须依靠两名嫌疑人的草图，似乎在20多岁时。 Interpol描述了一个嫌疑人，亚洲血统和英语扬声器，而另一个被描述为欧洲或北非血统和法语演讲者的比特。抢劫，抢劫似乎是专业人士的工作 - 一个大胆的，高价值的哈比主义者，速度和精确的人，他们知道如何处理武器，如何与人质有效处理，以及如何迅速预期警察反应。他们也聪明地选择他们的目标。 Magritte，其超现实主义绘画影响了Ed Ruscha，Andy Warhol以及Jasper Johns的工作，是比利时的全国宝藏，其中一些博物馆展示了他的工作。但盗贼避免了更大，更安全的大都市博物馆，支持来自艺术家的前家的一个特别有价值的绘画，只能通过预约开放，留下苗条的机会，他们才能找到更多的游客，而不是他们可以管理更多的游客。</p><p>  With little to go on, one of the first police officers to reach the crime scene called someone he knew could help: Lucas Verhaegen, a veteran officer with Belgium’s Federal Police force in a specialized unit called Section Art. Last August, when I met Verhaegen at police headquarters in central Brussels, he recalled the investigation from behind his tidy desk, next to a table piled high with old case files. He wore gray slacks, a short-sleeve button-up, and the scuffed black dress shoes favored by detectives and those who play them on TV. His face served as its own good-cop-bad-cop routine: friendly, disarming smile; penetrating blue eyes.</p><p>  几乎没有继续前进，其中一名警察致电犯罪现场叫做他认识的人可以帮助：比利时联邦警察部队的一名受资深官员在一个名为“艺术”的专门单位的资深官员。去年8月，当我在布鲁塞尔中部的警察总部遇到Verhaegen时，他回顾了他整洁的办公桌后面的调查，旁边是一个旧案例文件堆积高的桌子。他穿着灰色的裤子，一个短袖按钮，侦探和那些在电视上播放的人的磨碎的黑色礼服鞋。他的脸作为自己的良好警察常规常规：友好，酷炫的笑容;穿透蓝眼睛。</p><p>  “They know very well what they must do when there is a theft,” Verhaegen said of Belgium’s local police. “But when it’s art theft, what we need is a very good description, a photo; a maximum of information, very quickly, because we know that a lot of stolen objects go abroad. In the first hour, sometimes it’s in another country.”</p><p>  “他们很了解他们在有盗窃时必须做的事情，”韦尔赫根对比利时的当地警察说。 “但是当它是艺术盗窃时，我们需要的是一个非常好的描述，一张照片;最多的信息，很快，因为我们知道很多被盗物体出国。在第一个小时，有时它在另一个国家。“</p><p> Verhaegen was 51 at the time of the Magritte heist and had been a cop for two decades. It was a childhood dream that he pursued only after earning degrees in agronomy and biochemistry, then working for a few years in the private sector. His law enforcement career began with a five-year stint on the local police force in Brussels, where he patrolled the central district of Belgium’s capital city. Next he worked as part of a special intervention unit that investigated organized crime and managed underworld informants; he specialized in Eastern Europe. When he joined Section Art in August 2005, Verhaegen’s years of particular experience proved surprisingly useful: Serbian gangs are heavily involved in trafficking stolen art and antiquities, Verhaegen told me, along with organized crime networks that can be traced to Romania, Bulgaria, Moldova, and elsewhere in the Balkans and Eastern Europe.</p><p> 韦尔赫根在哈布里特·赫斯特时期为51人，并曾经是一名警察二十年。这是一个童年的梦想，只有在农艺和生物化学的赚取程度之后才能在私营部门工作几年。他的执法事业开始于布鲁塞尔的当地警察部队的五年核心，他在那里巡逻比利时市中心的首都。接下来，他作为一个特别干预股的一部分，调查有组织的犯罪和管理的黑社会信息人;他专注于东欧。当他在2005年8月加入第艺术部分时，特定的经验已经证明令人惊讶的是：塞尔维亚帮派曾涉及贩运被盗的艺术和古代，verhaegen告诉我，以及可以追溯到罗马尼亚，保加利亚，摩尔多瓦的有组织犯罪网络，在巴尔干和东欧的其他地方。</p><p>  “Our borders are open,” Verhaegen said. “It’s very easy to do an important art theft here in Belgium and then the same night, or 15 hours later, they are in Croatia or in Albania. There they can sell [the art] to finance their own criminal activities: drugs, arms, prostitution.”</p><p>  “我们的边界很开放，”韦尔赫根说。 “在比利时做一个重要的艺术偷窃，然后在同一个晚上，或者15个小时后，他们在克罗地亚或阿尔巴尼亚是非常容易的。他们可以卖掉[艺术]来融资自己的犯罪活动：毒品，武器，卖淫。“ </p><p> C ontinental Europe’s first art theft unit was established by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1796 and was focused not on stopping plunder but carrying it out on a scale unseen since the Romans took precious artifacts as spoils of war from Athens, Sicily, and Jerusalem. Napoleon’s repository for looted treasures was the Louvre, in Paris, where many of the works he acquired remain. In the wake of the Napoleonic Wars and again after the First World War, a patchwork of treaties gradually tried to regulate the looting, destruction, and trafficking of art and antiquities.</p><p>C在1796年，Napoleon Bonaparte建立了欧洲第一艺术盗窃单位，并没有陷入停止掠夺，但自罗马人从雅典，西西里岛和耶路撒冷战争的战争的战争中，不断地撤销。拿破仑的掠夺宝藏库是卢浮宫，在巴黎，他获得的许多作品仍然存在。在拿破仑战争之后，在第一次世界大战之后再次，逐渐试图逐渐试图规范掠夺，破坏和贩运艺术和古物。</p><p> Modern art crime, like the arms trade, still thrives in the shadow of global conflict, which gives rise to criminal networks that make from the detritus of war immensely profitable commodities. “There are master thieves and master forgers, but they are in small supply,” said Jake Archer, a special agent with the FBI’s art crime team. “More so, it’s accurate to say that there are transnational organized crime groups that are treating these objects just as they would any other illicit chattel.”</p><p> 现代艺术犯罪，如武器贸易，仍然茁壮成长在全球冲突的阴影下，这引起了从战争诽谤的犯罪网络犯有盈利商品的刑事网络。 “有大师盗贼和船长，但他们处于小型供应，”联邦调查局的艺术犯罪队特别代理商杰克阿克斯说。 “更多，所以，准确说，有跨国有组织的犯罪团体，这些犯罪群体就像任何其他非法动产一样对待这些物体。”</p><p>  Outside of agencies like Interpol, the practice of art crime investigation tends to reveal the national priorities, and even the national character, of the highly specialized local agencies tasked with enforcement. In Germany, for example, the roots of art crime investigation at the  Bundeskriminalamt trace back to postwar efforts to recover pieces looted by the Nazis; in France, the Central Office for the Fight Against Trafficking of Cultural Goods investigates not only art theft and forgery but the counterfeiting of luxury items like Hermès ties or Louis Vuitton bags; and in Italy, where even the architectural landscape can qualify as protected cultural heritage, the mandate of a carabinieri commando force includes the investigation of crimes involving archaeological goods. (This is no small task, an officer from the carabinieri tells me: In 2017, they went looking for signs of looting at Greek and Roman archaeological sites in Calabria, in southern Italy, and ended up uncovering a transnational gang in possession of some 10,000 pilfered artifacts.)</p><p>  在国际刑警组织等机构之外，艺术犯罪调查的实践倾向于揭示高度专业化的当地机构的国家优先事项，甚至国家性格。例如，在德国，Bundeskriminalamt的艺术犯罪调查的根源追溯到战后努力，以恢复被纳粹抢劫的碎片;在法国，违反贩运文化物品的中央局不仅调查了艺术盗窃和伪造，而是伪造了爱马仕的奢侈品，如爱马仕的关系或路易威登袋;在意大利，在建筑景观可以有资格作为受保护的文化遗产，卡拉巴尼埃利突击队部队的任务包括调查涉及考古商品的罪行。 （这不是一项小任务，来自Carabinieri的一名官员告诉我：2017年，他们在意大利南部的卡拉布里亚的希腊和罗马考古遗址寻找抢劫的迹象，并最终揭开了约10,000的跨国帮派盗贼神器。）</p><p>  Belgian police first established a Bureau of Art and Antiques in 1988. Thirteen years later, when Belgium reorganized its law enforcement agencies, the unit became part of the country’s federal police force and was renamed Section Art. Its team built and maintained a database of some 20,000 stolen objects and assisted local police departments throughout Belgium. In 2003, even as its staff began to dwindle, Section Art gained renewed prominence due to the increase in trafficking of illicit art and cultural goods which resulted from the U.S. invasion of Iraq. According to one investigation, as many as 130,000 items were ransacked by assorted criminals and opportunists, who sold them to Iraqi middlemen, who then resold them to foreign dealers.</p><p>  比利时警察于1988年首先建立了一位艺术局和古董局。三十年后，当比利时重组其执法机构时，该单位成为该国联邦警务部队的一部分，并重命名了部分艺术。其团队建立并维护了大约20,000个被盗物体的数据库，并在比利时协助当地警察部门。 2003年，即使其员工开始DWINDLE，艺术术局域艺术也在贩运非法艺术和文化物品的增加，这促成了美国侵犯伊拉克。根据一次调查，多达130,000件物品被什锦罪犯和机会主义者赎回，他们将他们卖给伊拉克中间人，然后将他们转售给外国经销商。</p><p> Under such circumstances, it does not take long for an illicit supply chain to take shape: Because looted art and antiques lack the kind of documentation required for legitimate transport, professional smugglers are tasked with getting them into the hands of unwitting collectors, dealers, and auction houses. And because these smugglers specialize in shipping drugs for cartels, guns for arms dealers, and prostitutes or laborers for human traffickers, looters who start as amateurs soon gain professional experience through their association with this diverse array of criminal talent.</p><p> 在这种情况下，非法供应链旨在造成非法供应链：因为抢劫艺术和古董缺乏合法运输所需的文件，专业的走私者是任务，让他们进入不知名的收藏家，经销商和拍卖房屋。由于这些走私者专注于Cartels的运输药物，武器经销商的枪支，以及人口贩运者的妓女或劳动者，从作为业余爱好者开始的抢劫者通过与这种不同的刑事人才的协会获得专业经验。</p><p> In time, organized crime syndicates were joined by another major player in this illicit market for looted Iraqi treasures: the extremist group known as the Islamic State, or ISIS. In Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State sought to shore up dwindling oil revenue by selling raided cultural antiquities, which were sometimes trafficked through Belgium, where the Islamic State had no fewer than three major terrorist cells. One of these cells was called the Zerkani network, with members based largely in Molenbeek, an impoverished neighborhood in Brussels that is more than 40 percent Muslim. The group’s leader, Khalid Zerkani, was so effective in radicalizing Molenbeek youths that some called him a “sorcerer” who enticed recruits to pick pockets and rob tourists in order to raise funds. Certain key members of this network were, according to Belgium’s federal prosecutor, Frédéric van Leeuw, members of Molenbeek street gangs who became radicalized while serving time in prison.</p><p> 及时，有组织的犯罪辛迪纳犯罪分子被这个非法市场的另一个主要参与者加入伊拉克珍品：极端主义群体称为伊斯兰国家，或者。在伊拉克和叙利亚，伊斯兰国家试图通过销售袭击文化古物来围流Dwwindling石油收入，这些古代有时通过比利时被贩运，伊斯兰国家没有少于三个主要的恐怖分子细胞。这些细胞之一被称为Zerkani网络，主要是在Molenbeek的成员，在布鲁塞尔的贫困社区，穆斯林超过40％。该集团的领导者Khalid Zerkani在激进的Molenbeek青年方面如此有效，其中一些叫他一个“巫师”，他为招募的士兵挑选口袋和抢劫游客筹集资金。据比利时联邦检察官，弗里尼姆街头成员的统计局的某些关键成员是Molenbeek街头团伙成员，他们在监狱中服务时变得激进。</p><p> When art museums fall prey to men more used to robbing banks, the results can be unpredictable: A painting might be ransomed or burned to ashes.</p><p> 当艺术博物馆落下抢劫银行的男性猎物时，结果可能是不可预测的：绘画可能会被赎回或烧成灰烬。 </p><p> It was Van Leeuw who first told me about the theft of Magritte’s  Olympia canvas. On a cloudy afternoon in January 2020, we met at his office in Brussels, where I was conducting research for a book. As part of my research, I’d asked the federal prosecutor to explain the challenges of linking terrorist organizations to their financial backers, which he agreed to do over tea. When I arrived at his eighth-floor office, overlooking the sprawling Belgian capital, he poured himself a cup while staring down at Molenbeek, which has been called by its own mayor “a fertile ground for terrorism.”</p><p>这是van leeuw首先告诉我关于盗窃的奥林匹亚画布的盗窃。在2020年1月20日的阴天下午，我们在布鲁塞尔的办公室见面，在那里我正在为一本书进行研究。作为我研究的一部分，我要求联邦检察官解释将恐怖组织与其金融支持者联系起来的挑战，他同意在茶中做。当我到达他的八楼办公室时，俯瞰庞大的比利时首都，他倾倒了一个杯子，同时盯着Molenbeek，它被自己的市长“恐怖主义肥沃的理由”所召唤。</p><p>  Since taking office in April 2014, Van Leeuw has been a driving force behind legislation imposing more severe punishments on former Islamic State fighters returning to Belgium, making him a prominent figure in Europe’s broader fight against extremism and terror. But prosecuting those responsible for financing terrorist acts, he said, has become increasingly difficult due to microfinancing, Bitcoin, and the growing ties between terror groups and other organized crime networks.</p><p>  自2014年4月的办理办公室以来，van Leeuw一直是立法的推动力，对前伊斯兰国家战斗者返回比利时的更严厉的惩罚，使他在欧洲更广泛地对抗极端主义和恐怖的争夺方面。但是，他说，起诉负责融资恐怖主义行为的人，由于微融资，比特币和恐怖组织与其他有组织犯罪网络之间的关系越来越困难。</p><p> He used as an example a case which he’d been unable to prosecute: A thief had “stolen a painting [by] Magritte here in Brussels,” Van Leeuw said, and “tried to have some money from the insurance companies” in exchange for its return. Years later, when police learned that the man had been radicalized, Van Leeuw became convinced that the art-napping had been a means to finance terror. But, he emphasized, this was only a theory—one that could not be proven in court unless he was able to show that financing terrorism was, at the time of the heist, the end goal. The time for proving such things, by then, had passed.</p><p> 他用作一个例子，他将无法起诉的案例：小偷“偷了一幅画[by] magritte在布鲁塞尔，”van leeuw说道，并“试图从保险公司中有一些钱”以换取因为它的回归。多年后，当警方了解到该男子一直被激进制化时，van Leeuw变得相信，艺术午睡是一种融资恐怖的手段。但是，他强调，这只是一个理论 - 除非他能够表明恐怖主义融资是，否则在法庭上无法证明，在赫斯特时，否则这是一个理论。那时，证明这些事情的时间已经过去了。</p><p> R escuing Magritte’s masterpiece was no small task for Section Art. Belgium’s elite unit, which launched with 17 officers, had been diminished by waves of retirements and years of budget cuts. When Verhaegen joined, he was one in a team of five; by the  Olympia theft, Section Art consisted solely of Verhaegen and his partner.</p><p> resuing magritte的杰作对于部分艺术没有小任务。比利时的精英单位，由17名官员推出，已被退休和多年的预算削减减少。当verhaegen加入时，他是五个团队中的一个;由奥林匹亚盗窃，部分艺术仅包括Verhaegen和他的伴侣。</p><p> “He has a fundamental understanding and appreciation of the art world; he possesses the investigative patience, the persistence, and savvy that is necessary to navigate both the domestic and international legal systems,” said the FBI’s Archer, who once collaborated with Verhaegen to recover seven paintings by the late Belgian surrealist Agnes Lorca, stolen long before from a fly-by-night gallery in Philadelphia. “He values teamwork, which is crucial on these complex matters. He has a big heart and cares for the victims and the pillaged works. And he enjoys a touch of eccentricity that is common among the few of us dedicated art crime investigators.” When Archer and his partner delivered the recovered paintings to Lorca’s daughter in Brussels, Verhaegen surprised his FBI colleagues with a special gift. “He grows his own grapes and makes his own wine,” Archer said. “We enjoyed the bottle thoroughly.”</p><p> “他对艺术界有基本的理解和欣赏;他拥有导航国内和国际法律制度所需的耐心耐心，持久性和精明，“FBI的阿切尔说，曾经与Verhaegen合作，以便在比利时超现实主义艾格尼斯洛卡·艾格尼斯·洛卡举行的七个绘画从费城的一位飞翔的画廊。 “他重视团队合作，这对这些复杂的事项至关重要。他有一个大的心灵，关心受害者和掠夺作品。他享有一丝古怪的怪物，这是美国少数专门的艺术犯罪调查人员。“当射手和他的伴侣向洛卡斯的罗塞尔的女儿提供回收的绘画时，Verhaegen将他的联邦调查局的同事带来了特殊的礼物。 “他生长了自己的葡萄并制作自己的葡萄酒，”阿切尔说。 “我们彻底享受了瓶子。”</p><p> Celebrations like these are likely to grow rarer in years to come. Despite being one of the most profitable criminal enterprises in the world, surpassed by drug trafficking, arms dealing, and human trafficking, among others, transnational art crime is viewed as a niche field by law enforcement agencies and is allocated fewer resources now than even a decade ago. For Verhaegen and his partner, as the last practitioners of their craft in Belgium, every phone call was important, whether it was from the FBI, Interpol, or local police. The high-profile Magritte heist raised the stakes: Recovering  Olympia would be a chance to show their budget-slashing superiors why Section Art mattered.</p><p> 像这些这样的庆祝活动可能在未来几年中咆哮。尽管是世界上最有利可图的犯罪企业之一，所以贩毒贩运，武器交易和人口贩运等，但跨国艺术罪被执法机构视为一个利基领域，现在分配了更少的资源，而不是一个十年前。对于verhaegen和他的伴侣，作为他们在比利时的工艺的最后一名从业者，每个电话都很重要，无论是来自联邦调查局，国际刑警组织还是地方警方。高调的Magritte Heist提出了赌注：恢复奥林匹亚将有机会展示他们的预算削减超级术语为什么艺术艺术问题。</p><p>  While helping his colleagues at Interpol prepare an alert for the missing painting, Verhaegen also assisted local police in Jette by fielding and analyzing tips from a network of informants in the art world and the Brussels underworld. It didn’t take long to develop information suggesting the involvement of a well-known organized crime figure. But rather than the Balkans or Eastern Europe, this information led to a working-class enclave in the Laeken neighborhood of Brussels, and a 20-year-old local named Khalid el-Bakraoui—the thief Van Leeuw would tell me about years later—who was growing out of teenage delinquency and into a life of crime and violence; a homegrown gangster, raised by conservative, religious parents who had made a nice life in Laeken after his father emigrated from Morocco.</p><p>  在帮助他的互联器的同事准备缺少绘画的警报时，Verhaegen还通过在艺术世界和布鲁塞尔黑社会网络的信息网络网络上进行速度和分析提示，帮助Jette。不需要长时间发展信息，表明着名的有名的有组织犯罪人物的参与。但而不是巴尔干或东欧，这些信息导致了布鲁塞尔的Laeken街区的工人阶级，也是一个20岁的当地名叫哈立德·埃尔 - 巴克劳尼 - 小偷van Leeuw会告诉我多年后 - 谁在少女犯罪和犯罪和暴力的生活中越来越多;由父亲从摩洛哥移民后，由保守派，宗教父母提出了一个由保守派，宗教父母提出了美好生活的歹徒。 </p><p> Because the heist involved guns and the threat of violence, a federal prosecutor granted investigators’ requests to employ “special techniques”—surveillance, wiretaps, and undercover operatives aimed at clarifying el-Bakraoui’s role and gathering evidence—but “because it was art theft,” Verhaegen said, his bosses considered the case low priority, which made it impossible to muster the necessary personnel and equipment. With few resources at their disposal, Verhaegen, his partner, and a small team of local police set up a low-budget sting operation: el-Bakraoui, who fit the physical description of one of the thieves, had made contact with  Olympia’s insurance underwriter, offering them a chance to pay a “reward” of 50,000 euros for the painting’s safe return, rather than having to pay out the full 800,000-euro claim made by the museum.</p><p>由于历史涉及枪支和暴力威胁，一份联邦检察官授予调查人员雇用“特殊技术”的要求 - 措施，乌龟和卧底遵守旨在澄清埃尔 - 巴克赖尼的角色和收集证据 - 但“因为它是艺术盗窃“Verhaegen说，他的老板被认为是低优先事项的情况，这使得这使得必要的人员和设备成为不可能的。凭借少数资源，verhaegen，他的伴侣，以及当地警察的一小组成立一个低预算的刺痛操作：符合其中一个盗贼的物理描述的El-Bakraoui就与奥林匹亚保险承销商联系了，为他们提供有机会支付50,000欧元的“奖励”为这幅画的安全回报，而不是必须支付博物馆的全额800,000欧元的索赔。</p><p> For insurers of fine art, such legally dubious arrangements are so routine that established “reward” rates are an open secret: as low as 3 percent of the insured value for items worth many millions of euros, and as high as 7 percent if the object is insured for 1 million euros or less. Market rates for ransom payments are not the only sign of the professionalization of art theft. In many of these art-nappings, when the thieves don’t have a way to contact the victim or the insurance company directly, they instead seek ransom payments through an intermediary in the murky world of art security.</p><p> 对于美术的保险公司，这种合法的可疑安排是如此常规，即建立了“奖励”率是一个公开的秘密：低至3％的被保险人的投保价值超过数百万欧元，如果物品的7％高达7％被保险100万欧元或更少。赎金支付的市场价格不是艺术盗窃专业化的唯一迹象。在许多这些艺术 - 诅咒中，当盗贼没有办法直接联系受害者或保险公司时，他们通过中介艺术安全的中介来寻求赎金支付。</p><p>  One such private enterprise is the Art Loss Register, which maintains an expansive database of stolen art. Unlike those maintained by the Belgian police, Interpol, and the carabinieri in Italy, anyone can query the database, making it a resource for honest buyers hoping to avoid stolen art as well as a kind of hotline for those hoping to ransom stolen objects. In some cases, Verhaegen says, these private firms have gone as far as facilitating payments through shell corporations in the Maldives or Panama, making them difficult for police to trace. But even these efforts don’t guarantee a painting’s safe return, especially if it’s been stolen by thieves unfamiliar with this tangle of unwritten rules.</p><p>  一个这样的私营企业是艺术损失寄存器，其维护了被盗艺术的广泛数据库。与由比利时警察，interpol和意大利的Carabinieri维护的人不同，任何人都可以查询数据库，使其成为诚实买家的资源，希望避免被盗艺术以及希望赎金被盗物体的人的热线。在某些情况下，Verhaegen表示，这些私营公司已经走得更远，就促进了马尔代夫或巴拿马的壳牌公司，使他们难以追踪。但即使这些努力也不保证绘画的安全回报，特别是如果它被盗贼滥用不熟悉这种不成文的规则。</p><p>  “What you have quite often in these museum thefts,” manager of International Art Fairs Will Korner tells me from the Art Loss Register headquarters in London, “is a high degree of planning in terms of the theft itself but very little planning, if any, as to what they will do with the object after they’ve stolen it.”</p><p>  “你经常在这些博物馆盗窃，”国际艺术博览会经理将告诉我伦敦的艺术损失登记总部，“在盗窃本身方面是一个很高的规划，但规划很少关于他们偷了它后他们将与对象做的事情。“</p><p> When art museums fall prey to men more used to robbing banks, the results can be unpredictable: Depending on the nerve of the thief, a painting as famous as  Olympia might end up being ransomed, traded for drugs, or burned to ashes. So Verhaegen’s team set a trap: The insurance underwriter for the stolen Magritte agreed to pay the suspect 50,000 euros, but, they said, to ensure that the canvas was indeed  Olympia, they demanded the transaction be facilitated by an expert—in actuality, an undercover police officer working as part of Verhaegen’s small team.</p><p> 当艺术博物馆落于抢劫银行的男人牺牲者，结果可能是不可预测的：取决于小偷的神经，作为奥林匹亚着名的绘画可能最终被赎回，为毒品交易，或烧毁。因此，verhaegen的团队设定了一个陷阱：被盗的Magritte的保险承销商同意支付嫌疑人50,000欧元，但是，他们说，为了确保画布确实是奥林匹克，他们要求通过专家实际促进交易，是卧底警察作为Verhaegen的小团队的一部分工作。</p><p> El-Bakraoui agreed to the meeting without hesitation, but when the day arrived, he canceled. A second meeting was arranged some days later, but he canceled that one too. With assistance from the special intervention unit, Verhaegen’s team might have been able to keep el-Bakraoui under surveillance and scope out the meeting place ahead of time, but lacking equipment and personnel, all they could do was wait for a call from a suspect who thought the police were onto him. In the end, the local police opted to recall the few officers they’d assigned to the case. Officially, the investigation remained open. But without officers working on it, the case went nowhere.</p><p> El-Bakraoui毫不犹豫地同意会议，但是当一天到达时，他取消了。第二次会议在几天后安排，但他也取消了那个。在特殊干预股的帮助下，Verhaegen的团队可能已经能够提前监视埃尔-Bakraoui，但缺乏设备和人才，他们所能做的就是等待嫌疑人的呼叫以为警察在他身上。最终，当地警方选择回忆起少数人分配给案件。正式的，调查仍然开放。但如果没有人员在工作中，就是无处不在的。</p><p> T wo years after the robbery, late in 2011, a retired cop named Janpiet Callens walked into a Brussels police station and handed over the  Olympia canvas.</p><p> 抢劫后，2011年下旬，一个名叫Janpiet叫的退休警察走进了一个布鲁塞尔警察局，交给了奥林匹亚帆布。 </p><p> “I was contacted by someone who wanted to return the painting,” Callens said to local media at the time. “The work was unsellable. They preferred a return to the owner over destroying it.”</p><p>“我被想回画的人联系，”召唤当时对当地媒体说。 “这项工作是不可选择的。他们喜欢返回所有者摧毁它。“</p><p>  Callens, then 62 years old, had taken his pension in 2009 and started a private consulting business. His role in recovering the stolen painting, barely two years into his retirement, made him an instant celebrity in certain art world circles. But his clients are mostly insurance companies, he says, and the work he does for them consists primarily of unglamorous tasks like investigating fraudulent claims and uncovering forgeries.</p><p>  那时62岁的召唤是在2009年的养老金，开始了私人咨询业务。他在恢复被盗绘画的角色，几乎没有两年的退休，使他成为某些艺术世界界的即时名人。但他的客户大多是保险公司，他说，他为他们所做的工作主要包括调查欺诈性索赔和揭露伪造者等违法的任务。</p><p> “When I retired they were very happy to have someone who knew the market,” Callens told me one hot afternoon in August, when I met him for a beer at a café in Brussels. Now 71, he possesses the countenance of a man very nearly at leisure and arrived wearing a mint-green polo shirt, buttoned to the top, with a fitness watch on one wrist and a Rolex Sea-Dweller on the other.</p><p> “当我退休时，他们非常乐意拥有一个了解市场的人，”当我在布鲁塞尔咖啡馆遇到他啤酒时，八月告诉我一个热门的下午。现在71，他对一个男人的面容非常闲暇而闲暇，穿着薄荷绿色马球衫，扣上顶部，在一个手腕上有健身手表，另一个手腕上的劳力士海居民。</p><p> His ascent into the world of fine art and fine watches hardly happened overnight. Early in his career, Callens spent 15 years busting “prostitutes and pimps” as part of a vice squad. Longing for something more and no longer enamored with nightlife, he went to work as a kind of liaison for Interpol, he says, before returning to the ranks of the federal police in Belgium, where he joined a unit focused on financial crimes. Many of his cases there involved high-dollar thefts and fraud, including art, antiques, and collectibles.</p><p> 他的上升进入美术和精美的手表几乎没有发生过夜。在他的职业生涯早期，召唤15年来破坏“妓女和皮条客”作为副队的一部分。他说，渴望更多，不再迷恋夜生活，他称之为国际刑警组织，他说，在返回比利时联邦警察的行列之前，他加入了一个专注于金融罪行的单位。他的许多案例都涉及高美元的盗窃和欺诈，包括艺术，古董和收藏品。</p><p> One case, Callens told me, involved a pair of men who bought unsigned paintings in the style of middle-class artists, added their forged signatures, and sold them for 500 or 1,000 euros. In the beginning, they were cautious, selling just one or two paintings each month. But because the scam kept working, they eventually grew bold enough to bring 80 of these paintings to a Brussels auction house—which soon led Callens to their door.</p><p> 一个案例，打电话告诉我，涉及一对男人在中产阶级艺术家的风格中购买了未签名的绘画，增加了他们的伪造签名，并将它们卖掉了500或1000欧元。一开始，他们谨慎，每月只卖一两幅绘画。但是因为骗局保持工作，他们最终会大胆地长大，让80个画拍摄到布鲁塞尔拍卖家 - 这很快就会给他们的门口给他们的门口。</p><p> “They couldn’t stop,” Callens said. “Because money, money, money.”</p><p> “他们无法停止，”召唤。 “因为金钱，金钱，金钱。”</p><p> In the end, the men received a light punishment, Callens said, because judges and lawyers think of art theft and forgery as crimes that only affect rich people. This, he told me, is a mistake—these are greedy criminals, not romantics, and society coddles them at its peril. Fortunately for Callens, he is now in the private sector, where he is no longer bound by the strictures and protocol</p><p> 最终，男子接受了一个轻度惩罚，因为法官和律师认为艺术盗窃和伪造为只影响富人的罪行。这是，他告诉我，这是一个错误 - 这些是贪婪的罪犯，而不是浪漫主义者，社会在其危险之中蔑视他们。幸运的是，他现在就在私营部门，他不再受到严格和议定书的约束 </p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/05/did-paying-a-ransom-for-a-stolen-magritte-painting-inadvertently-fund-terrorism">https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/05/did-paying-a-ransom-for-a-stolen-magritte-painting-inadvertently-fund-terrorism</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/盗窃/">#盗窃</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/theft/">#theft</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
