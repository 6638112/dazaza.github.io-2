The regulator said it could take the tech companies to court if it found they had broken consumer protection law.\n  The update follows a Financial Times  investigation into Amazon\u2019s product reviews last year, which exposed a lucrative ecosystem in which users were being paid to leave thousands of five-star ratings on its site. An investigation by Which? in February revealed an ecosystem of websites offering review manipulation services designed to game Amazon Marketplace listings. The company said it had uncovered \u201ca thriving industry where potentially hundreds of thousands of [reviews are] bought and sold for as little as \u00a35 each.\u201d\n The CMA said on Friday that Amazon may have failed to prevent sellers from manipulating product listings, for example, by taking positive reviews from other products and using them on their own. The CMA has also been working with other social media sites including Instagram and Facebook in connection with the trading of fake reviews.\n    Facebook promised in April to ban or suspend users who repeatedly set up groups and profiles to trade fake or misleading reviews, including fraudulent negative write-ups used by rivals to slam competitors.\n \u201cOur worry is that millions of online shoppers could be misled by reading fake reviews and then spending their money based on those recommendations,\u201d said Andrea Coscelli, the CMA\u2019s chief executive. \u201cEqually, it\u2019s simply not fair if some businesses can fake five-star reviews to give their products or services the most prominence, while law-abiding businesses lose out.\u201d\n He added: \u201cWe are investigating concerns that Amazon and Google have not been doing enough to prevent or remove fake reviews to protect customers and honest businesses. It\u2019s important that these tech platforms take responsibility, and we stand ready to take action if we find that they are not doing enough.\u201d\n In a statement, Amazon said: \u201cTo help earn the trust of customers, we devote significant resources to preventing fake or incentivized reviews from appearing in our store. We work hard to ensure that reviews accurately reflect the experience that customers have had with a product.\u201d\n It added:\u00a0\u201cWe will continue to assist the CMA with its inquiries, and we note its confirmation that no findings have been made against our business.\u201d\n Google said: \u201cOur\u00a0strict policies\u00a0clearly state reviews must be based on real experiences, and when we find policy violations, we take action\u2014from removing abusive content to disabling user accounts.\u00a0We look forward to continuing our work with the CMA to share more on how our industry-leading technology and review teams work to help users find relevant and useful information on\u00a0Google.\u201d\n \u00a9 2021 The Financial Times Ltd.

Companies like electric scooter providers Lime and Bird have raised tons of capital to change how the urban population gets around, but that growth has come at the cost of a bottom line still in the red.\n So it\u2019s striking to see electric scooter company Veo take a different approach to the business. Rather than raising venture capital and scaling quickly, the company does business the old-fashioned way: Proving the model works in one market before moving to the next. This slower, more methodical approach has worked in Veo\u2019s favor \u2014 it might be the only company in its industry that has been consistently profitable.\n Veo\u2019s approach reflects its co-founder and CEO Candice Xie\u2019s belief that transportation is not an industry that allows companies to scale rapidly and turn a big profit within a year, and especially not if it\u2019s going to make sense for a city. Electric scooters aren\u2019t just a business to Xie \u2014 they\u2019re a utility, a tool that can be best implemented through patient collaboration between public and private partners. The CEO has taken this ethos and executed Veo\u2019s business model with the expectation that it will make the company the most impactful in the industry.\n A former financial planner for automation solutions company, Schneider Electric, in Chicago, Xie launched Vue in 2017, partly inspired by the bike-share boom in Asia. She was decidedly against the poor quality bikes many operators were deploying at the time, and was also frustrated by the lack of affordable, safe and convenient transportation in Chicago. After some market research, Xie and her co-founder, Yanke (Edwin) Tan, a bike engineer, discovered the gap in last-mile transportation in the United States.\n The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity.\n In your  Medium post titled \u201cSorry, Boys. The First Profitable Micromobility Company Was Veo, Not Lime,\u201d you fired some shots at Lime and the tech bro-ey micromobility industry at large.  That was pretty bold.\n Thank you! I think because of the VC money and also the hype in the industry, a lot of people just forget how easy and simple the business should be. That\u2019s why I put out the post. It was just time to say something in the industry and help people to understand.\n  That was actually the time when Lime announced they were the first ones to achieve profitability, and  that\u2019s through EBITDA, and a lot of people were clapping for them.

The long-teased DirectStorage API that\u2019s meant to cut down loading times on gaming PCs much in the same way the Xbox Velocity Architecture speeds things up on Microsoft\u2019s consoles is on its way, and it won\u2019t be coming to Windows 10 like we originally thought.\n The Windows 11 exclusive feature improves communication between your storage device and graphics card, allowing assets to load quicker without having to pass through the CPU first. Naturally, this means more time spent gaming and less time reading the same hints as you move from area to area.\n It\u2019ll work best with systems that are dubbed \u2018DirectStorage Optimised\u2019, containing the right hardware and drivers for the job. If you\u2019re more of the DIY type that prefers to build the  best gaming PC yourself,  requirements demand an NVMe SSD with 1TB of storage or more. PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSDs and the latest GPUs from Nvidia and AMD will offer a better experience, but DirectStorage will still  work with older standards like the third generation PCIe 3.0 \u2013 you won\u2019t have much luck with 2.5-inch SATA drives, though.\n  DirectStorage will only work with games built using DirectX 12, so there\u2019s no telling how many titles will support the feature when you  upgrade to Windows 11 for free later this year.\n While you won\u2019t have access to this new feature on Windows 10, the operating system is still getting the 21H2 update in the second half of the year. Microsoft is keeping hush on whether that\u2019ll be its final patch, but this means you don\u2019t need to jump over to the new OS immediately if DirectStorage, auto HDR, and Android apps don\u2019t sell it for you.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 21:26:15", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "windows,\u6e38\u620f,directstorage", "title": "Xbox\u7684DirectStorage

Satya\u2019s always been one of my favorite tech execs to talk to, and Microsoft has some big news for us to discuss:  it announced Windows 11 yesterday, which comes with an all-new design, a bunch of new features, and the ability to run Android apps.\n That\u2019s all wrapped up in some big changes to how apps are  distributed on Windows: Microsoft is opening up the Windows app store, allowing developers to put more kinds of apps in the store, and it\u2019s allowing developers to bypass the fees in the store if they want to use their own payment systems.\n If you\u2019ve been  listening to  Decoder, you know there\u2019s  a lot of controversy about Apple\u2019s App Store fees and the control it has over developers on its platforms. There are lawsuits, there are bills in Congress,  and there are unhappy Europeans. Nadella and Microsoft are explicitly positioning Windows as the opposite, saying it\u2019s more open and that the goal of Windows is to allow other companies to build big businesses and platforms of their own without Microsoft getting in the way.\n If you think that sounds like a pretty intense role reversal for Apple and Microsoft, well, you\u2019re not wrong.  Twenty years ago, Microsoft was facing down regulators while the Mac was the more open platform. But I was curious how Nadella felt about it, how he thinks about Windows as a platform and what Microsoft\u2019s responsibilities are, and how he thinks the various antitrust bills in Congress will affect Microsoft\u2019s plans for the future. And I definitely wanted to know about the decision to run Android apps on Windows.\n A couple notes: Satya talks about Azure and \u201cthe edge\u201d a lot. Azure is one of Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing platforms that competes with Amazon\u2019s AWS and one of its biggest and most important lines of business. And if cloud computing is about computers far away from you in data centers, the edge is about the computers closest to you \u2014 like Windows PCs.\n Nadella also mentions \u201caggregators\u201d in the context of the Windows store. He\u2019s talking about places in the user interface where lots of people show up and are directed to the other apps and services they need. This is a reference to  Ben Thompson\u2019s aggregation theory, which actually comes up on  Decoder all the time.\n      Microsoft announced Windows 11 today. There is a lot to talk about, but I want to start with some personal news, as they say.   You only recently became the chairman  as well as the CEO of Microsoft. What does that actually mean to be the chairman?\n The reality is \u2014 as you know \u2014 when it comes to corporate governance in the United States at least, it\u2019s really the lead independent director who has full authority over all of the people who are part of the management, including me and my compensation and my performan.\n Basically they hire and fire me. The independent directors are the folks who have the governance. If anything, the way I interpret any change here is fundamentally how do we bring the management team and the board together around what is Microsoft\u2019s purpose [and] strategy? How do we hold ourselves accountable as a team?\n So orchestrating it, as somebody best described it to me \u2014 maybe I should attend more meetings, or more committee meetings. But I think of this as just a natural outgrowth of what I\u2019ve been doing for the last seven years. There\u2019s no real change, quite frankly, around the rigor of corporate governance and who has truly got the hire and fire authority on the CEO. And that\u2019s the independent directors of the Microsoft board.\n You led right into my next question, which is \u2014 who\u2019s your boss? To whom are you most accountable?\n To the board of directors and the lead independent director in some sense, if you think about it. If your boss is defined as the person who ultimately can hold you accountable, it\u2019s the independent directors of the Microsoft board.\n I ask every executive who comes on   Decoder  this question: what is your decision-making framework? Microsoft is a vast business. You have multiple lines of business, multiple billion-plus-dollar lines of business. How do you make decisions?\n I try to simplify this. Maybe you and I\u2019ve talked about this in the past \u2014 I\u2019ve had this framework which I\u2019ve been consistent with ever since I became CEO.\n It starts with mission, it ends with culture, and in between [there is] what\u2019s our worldview, what\u2019s our strategy. I think of the things that are constant as that sense of purpose and mission and culture, and the things that are temporal are worldviews and strategies.\n To your point about the decision-making framework: anything we do has to be aligned with that first question, which is: is this something that makes sense given who we are as a company? And more importantly, if we go about doing that, does it add unique value in the world? Is that something that both differentiates us competitively and is that something that\u2019s useful for people? That\u2019s, to me, the most helpful way to [run] the businesses we are in.\n When we say \u201cwhat does the CEO do?\u201d They have to pick and choose which businesses you\u2019re in. Then they have to set standards on what cultural values are expressed internally as experienced in the lived experience. And so those are the two things I try to go back to all the time.\n Let\u2019s talk about a big decision. Several years ago, you and I were talking and you said, \u201cWindows, we could just   rename it Azure Edge , if people would let us. It\u2019s just an extension of our big business, which is Azure. We\u2019re in a mobile-first, cloud-first world.\u201d\n In 2019, I think you had said to   Wired , \u201cThe operating system is   no longer the most important layer for us. \u201d But today,   Windows 11 was announced . I listened to you and Panos Panay, who\u2019s the chief product officer at Microsoft, discuss how the pandemic really refocused your attention on Windows and what it could be.\n  All of those statements that you said I\u2019ve made earlier are all still true because Windows doesn\u2019t live in isolation. Windows lives in a world where there is a lot of cloud computing.\n There are multiple cloud providers and a lot of cloud computing. So anything that is a client operating system ultimately does rendezvous with cloud computing. In that sense, technically and business-model-wise and usage and experience-wise, it\u2019s the cloud and the edge.\n The billion-plus users of Windows, for sure, we think of from a distributed computing architecture perspective as the edge of Azure. And you could even say the Windows folks would look at Azure as the cloud for Windows. So that\u2019s, I think, absolutely right.\n  The other point is it also lives in an ecosystem. Let\u2019s say Windows has a billion users. So does Android. So does iOS. In fact, Android and iOS will have more than a billion users perhaps, or maybe Android has 2 billion, [and] maybe iOS is similar to Windows size or what have you. But the reality is any Windows user \u2014 we have to start with the assumption that they have a phone and that phone may be Android and iOS and we have to design for it.\n I do think that operating systems are important, but they\u2019re important in so far as they compose with everything else that\u2019s part of my life, whether it\u2019s other devices with other operating systems, [or] whether it is clouds that I use, which are powering some of the applications and experiences.\n It\u2019s a practical reality, really. Let\u2019s meet Windows users where they are, and meet their current needs and unmet, unarticulated needs.\n You don\u2019t think that the pandemic pushed Windows in a different direction? That was very much the sense that I got. Everyone is working from home, everyone is staring at a Windows laptop for many more hours of a day than they might have been previously.\n  What happened in the pandemic, even for me \u2014 I didn\u2019t have a home office. Suddenly, I found myself [saying], \u201cOh my God, not only do I need a home office. I have all my girls home and they need all their own independent PCs.\u201d Without the PC, we wouldn\u2019t be able to do remote education, remote work, telemedicine visits. It became mission critical.\n All screens in life matter. So that realization that larger screens on which Windows runs are super important, because not all tasks can be done on a mobile device, became abundantly clear. We came out of the pandemic with \u2014 I would say \u2014 a renewed sense of why we need to do some of our very best work in serving [the] customers we have today.\n That\u2019s why I think about improvements to Windows Update. I want to celebrate that as much as any feature because it\u2019s important. It matters to our users. They tell me in my inbox loud and clear every day about what all I should be doing with Windows Update, and I take that seriously now.\n I like the idea that you were at home and your family was at home and suddenly Windows Update got real for you, too. My team is always telling me that whenever it\u2019s about me, it becomes much more important. Was there any of that going on?\n Oh, for sure. Although I\u2019ll have to admit that the people inside the company are a lot more responsible than waiting for a CEO to have a personal experience. We have better systems, better accountability [than that[.\n But that said, if I go back to your decision-making framework [question], I think I have a better appreciation coming out of this pandemic about Windows\u2019 role in the world. As an ecosystem, as an operating system \u2014 what should we do so that we are serving the current customers and their expectations? Windows Update being one [example]. And also, what should its innovation vector be given where the world is going?\n That brings me to some of the big changes in Windows, which are fundamentally about what kind of operating system Windows is going to be and what kind of businesses you can run on it and what kind of business will that be for Microsoft.\n There is a new user interface. The Start button is in the center of the screen. There\u2019s cosmetic differences. But you\u2019re also   allowing Android apps to run on Windows . You are integrating the Amazon Android app store. You\u2019ve made some changes to the store economics. You\u2019ve reduced Microsoft\u2019s cut to   15 percent . That\u2019s in comparison to the very controversial 30 percent that Apple charges.\n Then you\u2019re saying to developers, \u201cYou can be in our store and you can not pay us a cut at all if you want to   use your own payment model .\u201d How much of that is opportunistic changes \u2014 you\u2019re seeing all the controversy and you sense a market opportunity? And how much of it is this being the correct way to shift your business\u201d?\n I think it\u2019s driven by competition. What I mean by that is \u2013 what should Microsoft do to manage the platform and the platform rules such that we can thrive in that role?\n The way I\u2019ve interpreted what platforms do is: they have to create opportunity for people who build on the platform.\n That\u2019s the way to keep a platform relevant. If you\u2019re creating a great opportunity for others to be born on your platform and scale on your platform \u2014 that\u2019s the Microsoft I grew up in. That\u2019s the Windows I grew up with. Whether it is the Adobe folks creating their Creative Cloud or SAP building their ERP [enterprise resource planning] business. Or in today\u2019s world, whether it\u2019s Discord building their community for gamers on Windows or any other business.\n   I sense a real opportunity, because the other two ecosystems that are at scale, for their own internally consistent set of reasons, have conflated \u2014 at least in my mind \u2014 the platform and the aggregation layer with one set of rules. There\u2019s no reason why there should be one set of rules. They can be disaggregated.\n After all, we do have a store. We do have commerce. You can use it all or you can bring your own. That\u2019s [a] practical thing for Microsoft to do.\n I\u2019m not even trying to make some value statement that Microsoft is virtuous here and others are not. Others have chosen it for whatever reasons they have. This is a design choice and a business model choice. I want to make our own set of design and business model choices so that creators find more choice.\n That\u2019s competition. I go back and say, \u201cIt\u2019s time to compete.\u201d\n You mentioned the other two platforms at scale. That\u2019s obviously iOS and Android. Then you mentioned the internally consistent reasons for their decisions. Apple has been pretty clear about its internally consistent reasons for saying the store extends across its entire platform. The loudest reason is that this is how Apple pays for giving the software away for free. Everybody gets iOS updates for free over the life of their phone, [and] the phones last a long time. To pay for all of that innovation, and software, and security updates, and all those things, Apples takes a cut of what happens in the store. That\u2019s Apple\u2019s business model.\n You also give Windows away. If I have a newer PC, I\u2019m just going to be able to update to Windows 11 for free. How do you pay for those updates if you\u2019re not going to take a cut of everything?\n We have different business models. In many cases, we have subscriptions. We also have OEM royalties. Apple obviously has device gross margin. I think everyone ultimately has to have a business model that allows [them] to pay for what they do. I think it\u2019s just a question of, where are you monetizing and what are then the rules on which fundamentally others can monetize? They have to be long-term stable.\n In our case at Microsoft, I\u2019ve always felt that, at least the definition of a platform is: if something bigger than the platform can\u2019t be born, then it\u2019s not a platform.\n The web, it grew up on Windows. Think about it. If we said, \u201cAll of commerce is only mediated through us,\u201d Amazon couldn\u2019t exist, if we had somehow said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have our own commerce model.\u201d\n  Therefore I think each company has to choose and see what aggregation layer, what platform layer, [and] what rules work for them and their ecosystem. But, in our case, it\u2019s very clear to us that we do want to solve for the same security issues, [and] discoverability issues, because that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re emphasizing the store.\n At the same time, the store can be used at different levels by different creators. We want to have that flexibility be a competitive differentiation.\n You mentioned rules. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m VP of   The Verge  at Microsoft. My goal for the year is to increase Verge signups by 30 percent. The easiest way for me to do that is to go to the Windows team and say, \u201cEvery time you open Windows, show people   The Verge . Push them towards a signup to   The Verge .\u201d This is a pressure that every operating system feels. Windows has certainly felt this push and pull. The Edge team wants Edge to be the default browser in Windows.\n How do you balance that internal pressure against wanting to be an open platform where competitors can succeed against Microsoft\u2019s own products?\n There are two different things. One, you curating a set of experiences that work well with each other, and then allowing for someone else to curate an experience that perhaps is a substitute to something. [Do] you allow that only through your store or other rules, or is that something that can happen independent of you?\n Take the browser, which is at this point pretty foundational. We, of course, have a browser. It is default. But you don\u2019t need to go to Microsoft. You can go to Google and download their browser, or you can go to Firefox and download their browser. In some sense, [that\u2019s the] ability to have both agency as a consumer to directly choose, and at the same time, preserving our right to curate and, quite frankly, the right of others to curate as well.\n We want to be a  platform for  platform creators, not just a platform for other people\u2019s apps. That\u2019s the subtle difference we want to call up, which is: I want us to do a great job of being a platform. That means all the things platforms do. We\u2019ll have a store. We\u2019ll have our own defaults. We will curate stuff. But if somebody else can come in and create lots of value on our platform and use it as the base infrastructure, [at the] OS level, so be it \u2014 including the store.\n By the way, that\u2019s how we run our cloud. It\u2019s not like this is that different to us. We have layers in the cloud from the applications all the way to infrastructure. Different application vendors and companies use it in different ways.\n It\u2019s funny that you brought up browsers. Microsoft famously fought an antitrust battle about bundling the browser with Windows and setting it as the default. It feels like the rules of the road there are a little bit clearer. There is a lot of history about browser defaults in Windows. What about places where it\u2019s less clear? Do you have internal rules? Do you have a culture that says, \u201cOkay. We can set a default, but the Windows team needs to build the hooks for other platforms and other services to be defaults\u201d?\n Absolutely. There is no question. But, first of all, whatever we learned out of our case in the \u201890s means that you just need to be an open platform. There are certain things that are built into the operating system. If there are things that are independent of the operating system, then others can absolutely substitute without compromising the integrity of the system.\n Even communications \u2014 whether it\u2019s Slack, or Zoom, or anything else \u2014 [they] can be first class on Windows. In some sense, we don\u2019t have that restriction that other people\u2019s software in its full glory cannot be available on Windows. We do have distribution advantages, but that doesn\u2019t mean that other people don\u2019t have their own distribution advantages. For me, whenever I visit some Google site, they\u2019re very clear about their distribution advantage, even on a Windows PC. There is just no way to escape that, and that\u2019s okay.\n  Probably YouTube, I think, is the one that most often comes up on my Bing search.\n Speaking of Google \u2014 you are bringing Windows closer to Android. That\u2019s been going on for some time. One of the biggest announcements of Windows 11 is that Android apps will run directly on Windows. What were the pros and cons of that decision?\n Interestingly enough, the Windows architecture\u2019s always had this. You can have multiple personalities in Windows. In fact, I remember when I first started at Microsoft, I was evangelizing the POSIX interface on top of Windows NT. And now one of the favorite features of Windows for me is WSL. I love it. The new terminal, and the fact that now we even support the full Linux UI on Windows. Linux is now first class on Windows, and Android is just another subsystem. Now we can support these multiple personalities.\n The decision for us was \u2014 what\u2019s the best way to both allow for more applications to be available to our users? How can we add value to the 1.3 billion [Windows] users who may want more applications? That\u2019s one side of it.\n The other side of it is to create more opportunity for people who have built Android apps by exposing them to this billion-plus user base. I think that both sides benefit from this, and it was a fairly straightforward decision to go enable that. And now it\u2019s going to be driven by what is the adoption, what are the use cases, what apps do they want to use that are Android on Windows versus PWAs versus UWPs and what have you. We are going to take that approach, where we welcome all apps.\n  I think always the argument will be, \u201cdo we have to have a consistent app model?\u201d\n Because if you think about innovation \u2014 is there is some kind of NUI or even an AI chip that we want to light up? How can the APIs of that be lit up in such a way that this application can take advantage of it? When you have multiple subsystems and multiple app models, can you surface your platform system-level innovation such that all apps li\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-25 21:25:15", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "windows,android,amazon,\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a,rust", "title": "\u5bf9Windows 11\u7684attya nadella\u91c7\u8bbf\uff0c\u5c06Windows\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1Android\uff0c\u5c06\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900aAppstore\uff0c\u56fd\u4f1a\u7684\u53cd\u6258\u62c9\u65af\u7968\u636e\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u66f4\u591a ", "title_en": "Interview with Satya Nadella about Windows 11, bringing Windows closer to Android, integrating Amazon Appstore, antitrust bills in Congress, and more", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/22549385/microsoft-satya-nadella-interview-windows-11-decoder?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4", "via": "", "real_tags": ["windows", "android", "amazon", "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a", "rust"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1068229, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u55e8Leizhen\u548c\u90ae\u4ef6\u5217\u8868\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u6211\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u8865\u4e01\u4eceBtrfs Selftest\u4e2d\u5220\u9664\u4e86\u8c03\u8bd5OOM\u9519\u8bef\u6d88\u606f\u3002\u5b83\u6ca1\u6709\u7279\u522b\u7684\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u6838\u5fc3\u65b0\u624b\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u5c0f\u6e05\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u4f46\u90ae\u4ef6\u5730\u5740\u8ba9\u6211\u8c28\u614e\uff0c\uff06\uff0334; @ huawei.com\uff06\uff0334;\u4e0a\u6b21\u6211\u4eec\u4ece\u540c\u4e00\u5bb6\u516c\u53f8\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u505a\u4e00\u4e9b\u65e0\u5bb3\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff06\uff0334;\u6e05\u7406\uff06\uff0334;\u4f46\u662f\u90a3\u4e9b\uff06\uff0334;\u4fee\u590d\uff06\uff0334;\u4e5f\u6ca1\u7528\u3002\u8fd9\u8ba9\u6211\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\uff0c\u8fd9\u91cc\u771f\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\u3002\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e9b\u5feb\u901f\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u7684OOM\u9519\u8bef\u6d88\u606f\uff06\uff0334;\u6e05\u7406\uff06\uff0334;\u8865\u4e01\u521a\u521a\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u4e00\u4e9b\u62fc\u5199\u4fee\u590d\u3002\u5b83\u548c\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21/\u5b66\u751f\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4ea4\u6b64\u7c7b\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u6211\u771f\u7684\u5e0c\u671b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8865\u4e01\u6210\u4e3a\u957f\u671f\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u3002\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0a\uff0c\u6211\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\uff0c\u5f00\u59cb\u4e86\u5185\u6838\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6267\u884c\u6b64\u7c7b\uff06\uff0334;\u6e05\u7406\uff06\uff0334;\u4f46\u662f\u4f60\u4eec\u6240\u505a\u7684\u662f\u771f\u6b63\u7684KPI\u6293\u200b\u200b\u53d6\u4e86\uff0c\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u770b\u5230\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u4e0e\u4f60\u4e89\u8bba\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u8005\u548c\uff0334;\u6e05\u7406\uff06\uff0334;\u548c\u4f60\u66fe\u7ecf\u634d\u536b\u81ea\u5df1\u5c1d\u8bd5\u83b7\u5f97\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8865\u4e01\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u3002\u4f60\uff06\uff0339;\u91cd\u65b0\u53d1\u9001\u4ee3\u8868\u8d35\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\uff06\uff0339;\u91cd\u590d\u635f\u5bb3\u5df2\u7ecf\u7834\u574f\u7684\u58f0\u8a89\u3002\u8bf7\u505c\u6b62\u8fd9\u79cdKPI\u6293\u4f4f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u505a\u51fa\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u635f\u574f\u7684\u58f0\u8a89\u3002\u8c22\u8c22\uff0c\u66f2 ", "note_en": "Hi Leizhen, and guys in the mail list,  Recently I find one patch removing a debug OOM error message from btrfs  selftest.

The last time we got some similar patches from the same company, doing  something harmless &#34;cleanup&#34;. But those &#34;fixes&#34; are also useless.

Partly because I see them as a waste of time, partly because I&#39;m far too pessimistic to think that I&#39;d be able to put together anything &#39;win-worthy&#39; in such a short period of time.\n   Being someone who is fairly experienced in the ways of GCP (formerly Associate Cloud Engineer/Professional Cloud Architect certified), I figured this would be a fun break from the never-ending marathon that is building a startup ( uFincs, by the way).\n  Besides the per-category themes, you also had to make use of the new GKE &#34;Autopilot&#34; mode, along with the GCP Cloud Code IDE extension\n A prize pool of $10k USD distributed as $2k to each category winner, along with $2k in a bonus category for &#34;Best use of GKE Autopilot&#34;\n Lasts from  March 29th to  April 21st (basically a month, if you include pre-official start time)\n First of all, this is the first month-long hackathon that I&#39;ve ever seen. I mean, I guess it makes sense given the (virtual) times we live in, but still, I thought that was a pretty excessive timeline.\n Secondly, the requirements seemed rather easy. I&#39;m decently experienced with GKE, so just making it\u00a0 easier\u00a0by tacking on Autopilot meant that all I had to worry about was choosing a category to enter in.\n For reference, GKE&#39;s new\u00a0 &#34;Autopilot&#34; mode\u00a0just relieves you, the cluster operator, from having to worry about managing nodes. Instead of getting billed based on nodes, you get billed based on how much CPU/RAM each pod is allocated (except it costs a\u00a0 lot\u00a0more, strictly comparing compute resources).\n Finally, while $2k per category is a pretty nice chunk of change, it definitely wasn&#39;t enough to warrant building a fully custom project and\u00a0 certainly\u00a0didn&#39;t warrant a month&#39;s worth of work.\n As the start date of the hackathon approached, I brainstormed some ideas but ultimately decided that it wouldn&#39;t really be worth my time. The better ROI here was prepping uFincs for launch, so I decided to just continue on with my marathon instead.\n In the meantime, I registered for the hackathon and joined the related Slack team just to keep an eye on updates (and on the competition).\n  A month has passed. I had just finished up some big feature development work for uFincs along with dealing with some ops-related tasks that I had been putting off (check out the start of the\u00a0 DevOps Detour series\u00a0if you&#39;re interested in that). I was well on track for launching uFincs in the next week.\n It was purely coincidental that on  April 21st, the final day of the hackathon, I checked into the Slack channel to see an update\u00a0 saying\u00a0that it was the last day of the hackathon. It was around 7:00 PM at this time, and the hackathon finished at 3:00 AM my time.\n I made the fortunate decision to log in to the hackathon platform and check out what projects had been submitted. With only ~8 hours to go, surely most teams would have submitted by now (or not, depending on what kind of person you are). And you know what I saw?\n  While 3 of the 4 categories had a smattering of submitted projects (no more than 3 or 4 each), the &#34;Next Level of Gaming&#34; category had zero entrants.\n  If I could submit something,\u00a0 anything, to this category, then I&#39;d be the winner! Obviously. It was just a small matter of submitting\u00a0 what...\n Well, this is where the &#39;cheating&#39; comes into play. See, the\u00a0 official rules\u00a0for the hackathon didn&#39;t say that you couldn&#39;t re-use code from an existing project \u2014 all you needed was the IP rights to submit the project (heck, you didn&#39;t even have to submit any source code).\n     Re-purposing the Dank Meme Classifier into a game of sorts was one of the ideas I had had when first brainstorming for the hackathon, but considering the time constraints, I didn&#39;t think it&#39;d be wise to attempt anything of the sort. So I decided that The Buzzword Bingo would be perfect, considering it was already a game!\n In fact, The Buzzword Bingo was also already containerized. So really, all I had to do was spin up a new GKE cluster, deploy it, and call it a day!\n And at 7:00 PM, that&#39;s what I decided to do: I committed myself to getting this project back up and running and submitting all of the necessary components of the hackathon project (namely: some marketing fluff, a demo video, and some slides).\n First things first was provisioning a new Autopilot cluster to deploy on. I decided to spin up a separate GCP project to keep everything contained (and so that I could easily tear it all down later). I used\u00a0 Kubails\u00a0(my home-grown framework for developing GKE-native apps) to provision a new project and quickly deployed a new cluster using the generated Terraform configs \u2014 although I had to do some minor tweaks to get the Autopilot settings working since it conflicted with some existing node pool configs.\n Within a couple minutes, my new cluster was up and running. I tried to deploy my usual stack of\u00a0 cert-manager\u00a0and\u00a0 ingress-nginx, but ran into some more conflicts with Autopilot mode. If I remember correctly, one of the deployments tried to make some changes to\u00a0 kube-system, but that namespace seemed to be locked down in Autopilot clusters. I can understand why, but it did make my life a bit harder.\n Well actually, it ended up making my life\u00a0 easier. By foregoing\u00a0 cert-manager\u00a0and\u00a0 ingress-nginx, I was able to just deploy the two services that make up The Buzzword Bingo (a backend WebSocket server and a frontend React app) directly as deployments with individual load balancer services. It was gonna cost me more to run it (since using\u00a0 ingress-nginx\u00a0would have meant only needing a single load balancer), but this was only going to be for a short time anyways. And with a $2k prize on the line, I figured I could afford it.\n And you know what else I figured I could afford? A new domain name. See, I actually do have an always-available version of\u00a0 The Buzzword Bingo\u00a0(for portfolio purposes), but I run it on GCP Cloud Run because it&#39;s\u00a0 basically\u00a0free (haven&#39;t been charged for it yet and I hope you, dear readers, don&#39;t end up costing me anything :). But since the version running for the hackathon would be on a different IP, I figured a new domain name couldn&#39;t hurt.\n I finally decided on a minor re-branding:\u00a0 http://lovelybuzzwordbingo.com\u00a0(now defunct). Why &#34;Lovely&#34;? Because the whole theme of the hackathon was &#34;love&#34;, and if I was\u00a0 really\u00a0gonna phone it in, I might as well make this the one on-theme change that I would make. Cause I certainly didn&#39;t have the time nor care to make any other changes.\n With the domain name bought, the load balancers balancing, and the DNS records\u2026 resolving, by 8:00 PM, the Lovely Buzzword Bingo was now open for business!\n That was the &#39;hard&#39; part. Or &#39;less easy&#39; part. I mean, I can deploy GKE apps in my sleep at this point (or at least, my Cloud Build pipelines can), so the only thing left to do was write up all the marketing fluff for &#34;what the project is&#34;, &#34;what problem it solves&#34;, &#34;how it does it&#34;, yada yada. Having spent the last few months writing marketing copy for uFincs, that wasn&#39;t much of a problem (although my many years of bullshitting-through-school-projects certainly helped as well).\n Of course, it was oh-so-much easier to write these kinds of things when you&#39;re not taking it seriously. I mean, the app in and of itself is pure &#34;not taking it seriously&#34;, so at least we were on theme for that (for reference, I originally made The Buzzword Bingo as a joke\u2026 for a presentation\u2026 in an ethics course\u2026 in university).\n The only minorly annoying part of the submission requirements was a 3-5 minute &#39;pitch&#39; video showing off the project. Since we didn&#39;t even have to submit the source code, I assumed that this was basically all the judges were basing their decisions on. So I&#39;d have to be utterly deliberate about thoroughly explaining every minute detail of the project.\n Or something like that. I&#39;ll let you be the judge of just how terrible my pitch was:\n   In fact, I&#39;ll let you be the judge of my whole submission: everything I submitted can be found at the end of this post.\n Ultimately, by 10:00 PM, I had my video recorded, my marketing fluffed, and my slides hastily thrown together. Clicked submit and called it a night, hoping that no one else would submit any more &#39;gaming&#39; projects and that I&#39;d be the de facto winner.\n  I woke up the next morning to have my worst fears realized: there were more gaming submissions. Not one. Not two. But\u00a0 three\u00a0more submissions had shown up in the wee hours of the night.\n  Looking over the other submissions (which I won&#39;t include here because of &#39;legal&#39; reasons), some of them definitely looked like they had\u00a0 work\u00a0put into them. Like, one of them had a whole story for how they came up with the idea, beta tested it, implemented it, and further conducted user testing. I honestly thought that that project had it in the bag.\n The worst part of all this is that the gaming category didn&#39;t even end up having the fewest submissions; one of the other categories only had two!\n Sigh. At least I didn&#39;t waste much time putting the whole thing together. And it was certainly hilarious to imagine what the judges would think when they would inevitably have to gaze upon my monstrosity. But I definitely didn&#39;t have any hopes of winning at this point.\n So I just kind of forgot about the whole hackathon after that. Judging would happen over the next week with the winners being announced on  May 3rd as part of a Kubernetes conference. Maybe I&#39;d remember to check the Slack sometime in the future to see how it went down.\n  (And back to uFincs I went, where I finally launched and gained my first paying customers. Check out that story here:\u00a0 uFincs Update #7)\n  Remember, I had completely forgotten about the hackathon at this point. I was just riding off the high of more-or-less successfully launching uFincs to the world.\n So when I received the following email from one of the hackathon coordinators, you could say that I was surprised:\n Thank you all for participating in the {Code_Love_Hack}!\u00a0  On behalf of Google, I wanted to let you know that we appreciate all the time, effort and dedication that went into creating each amazing project. The judges had so much fun seeing all the apps and games you created!   Without further ado, here are the {Code_Love_Hack} winners:   Challenge #1 - The Next Level of Love Team Member: [redacted] Project: [redacted]   Challenge #2 - For the Love of Gaming Team Member: Devin Sit Project: Lovely Buzzword Bingo   Challenge #3 - Spreading the Love: Team Member: [redacted] Project: [redacted]   Challenge #4 - Wildcard AND For the Best Use of Google Kubernetes Engine Autopilot: Team Member: [redacted] Project: [redacted]  Congratulations to the challenge category winners and congratulations to all for creating such wonderful projects!! BeMyApp will be reaching out to the winning\u00a0teams, as well as the winners of the survey participation drawing.\n  So yeah, somehow, by the grace of all-that-be at Google, I won the gaming category. With &#39;only&#39; 3 hours of work.\n  I can only assume this was possible because the judges were greatly amused by the idea of playing Buzzword Bingo at their next meeting. Or perhaps they just found the other entries to somehow be even\u00a0 worse. I don&#39;t know. I doubt they&#39;d tell me even if I asked: the\u00a0 official rules\u00a0prohibit them from revealing the scores they gave for each project.\n In any case, I&#39;d say $2k USD for 3* hours of work is probably the best ROI I&#39;ll ever make, at least for a very long time.\n And that&#39;s how I won a month-long hackathon in 3 hours. By reusing old work, making a big joke out of it, and not taking it seriously\u00a0 at all.\n  * Obviously it took me more than 3 hours to originally build The Buzzword Bingo, but that\u2019s not exactly the point, is it Mr. Pedant?\n     There is nothing to disclaim except that there are no disclaimers. I wasn&#39;t paid to write this post or promote GCP in any way \u2014 I just thought the whole affair was funny.\n  And here&#39;s everything that I submitted as part of the hackathon. May it guide all of your future hackathon&#39;ing efforts.\n    \u201cA game to synergize with your corporate friends at the next holistic team meeting.\u201d\n           \u201cYou know, sometimes, when I&#39;m listening to my boss, or my boss&#39; boss, ramble on and on about &#39;innovation&#39;, &#39;best practices&#39;, and &#39;blockchain&#39;, I just want to tune out. I&#39;m sure all of my teammates want to as well, since we&#39;re all in the same boat really.

The lead developer was in-house and I was remote. They had no version control.  One day the lead developer was out sick and they asked me to deploy a feature to the live website. First time this has happened - I have no knowledge of their deployment setup. The new feature was developed by an outside company and it was described to me as a sales tool.  Hmm, how am I going to deploy this? Who cares for now - let me look at the files they have given me. They changed 7 existing files. Of course, I had been using Git on the side the whole time - I ran the diff. Each file had the same change - they had added code that makes an ajax saveEmail() call onBlur. In other words, email addresses were being saved to the database when a user inputs an email and the input loses focus.  The first thought that came to my mind was - I&#39;m not going to be here much longer. And it&#39;s not because I quit (I probably should have).  I told my client - apologies, but I don&#39;t want to work on this task because it&#39;s a dark pattern. And they reply - no, no, we are just sending people 3 email reminders. And then I try to explain that it&#39;s basically saving email addresses secretly.  The work relationship fizzled out a month later. This was a good client for me in terms of consistent work.  It&#39;s hard for people to understand or care about ethics in programming.

The annual fees were too high, the minimum amount required to invest was too high, and there was a penalty when you removed your money. Additionally, the transaction takes a certain amount of financial know-how that most people don\u2019t possess.\n For Pineda, disrupting the financial sector also seemed like a lot of fun, he thought.\n \u201cI liked the idea of challenging the financial banks, and you can\u2019t do that without technology. We have this super tool that my parents didn\u2019t have, and you can disrupt an entire industry,\u201d Pineda told TechCrunch.\n While traditional mutual funds in Chile and Mexico charge up to 6.45% and 5% annually, Fintual charges 1% annually of assets managed. Additionally, Fintual doesn\u2019t require a minimum investment nor a minimum amount of time invested, and users can take their money out any time with no penalties.\n \u201cIt\u2019s different than the U.S.; we invest way less than you do; by a factor of 10 maybe,\u201d Pineda said, comparing the investment rate in Chile.\n In 2018, the company was accepted into Y Combinator and became the first Chilean startup to go through the prestigious accelerator. It has been growing exponentially ever since and today it serves 57,000 clients in Chile and Mexico.\n Below is a table that shows their growth including money managed and percent growth each year since launch.\n   The current raise will be used to grow the company\u2019s operations in Mexico, expand to other countries \u2014 namely Colombia and Peru \u2014 and grow its tech team.\n In addition to Kaszek, other investors to date include YC, ALLVP, and angel investors such as Plaid\u2019s CTO, Jean-Denis Greze, and Cornershop\u2019s founder Oskar Hjertonsson. To date, the company has raised about $15.2 million.\n Fintual\u2019s impressive growth speaks for itself, but Kaszek\u2019s co-founder and managing partner, Nicolas Szekasy, said the fund has been following Fintual since its early days, and he was impressed with the niche market the team identified and even more impressed with the user experience the company had developed which has, in turn, fueled its growth.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 20:04:11", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "ventures,\u6295\u8d44", "title": "Kaszek Ventures\u5728\u667a\u5229\u8d44\u4ea7\u7ba1\u7406\u542f\u52a8\uff0cFintual\u4e2d\u8fbe\u52301500\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tKaszek Ventures leads a $15 million round in Chilean asset management startup, Fintual\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/kaszek-ventures-leads-a-15-million-round-in-chilean-asset-management-startup-fintual/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["ventures", "\u6295\u8d44"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "b5cf61e4b6196fec55c60d9c02044980.jpg", "infoid": 1068220, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u73b0\u5728\u670930\u4ebf\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7684Android\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u6e34\u671b\u652f\u6301Android\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u7edd\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8bbe\u5907\u90fd\u662f\u624b\u673a\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u5bf9\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684Android\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6ca1\u6709\u7279\u522b\u611f\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u62bd\u51fa\u624b\u673a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548c\u60a8\uff06\uff0339;\u91cd\u65b0\u5b8c\u6210\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u975e\u7535\u8bddAndroid\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e5f\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u78e8\u635fOS\uff0cAndroid\u5e73\u677f\u7535\u8111\uff0cAndroid\u6c7d\u8f66\uff0cAndroid\u7535\u89c6\u548c\u8c37\u6b4c\u6f14\u5458\u3002\u8c37\u6b4c\u5e0c\u671b\u66f4\u591a\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u6765\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5176\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u4e3a\u6b64\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u62cd\u6444\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u666e\u901a\u8bed\u8a00\uff1a\u91d1\u94b1\u3002\n \u8c37\u6b4c\uff06\uff0339;

The vast majority of those devices are phones, so for app developers not particularly interested in the wider Android ecosystem, that means pump out a phone app and you&#39;re done. But a vibrant ecosystem of nonphone Android hardware is also out there, though\u2014Wear OS, Android tablets, Android Auto, Android TV, and Google Cast. Google would like more developers to support those devices, and its new scheme for this has a real shot at working since it relies on the universal language: money.\n Google&#39;s master plan is called the &#34; Play Media Experience Program,&#34; and it offers a compelling proposition to developers: support more Android form factors, and Google will take a lower cut of your Play Store sales. Media apps focusing on video, audio, or books now have special support targets they can hit that will result in Google cutting Play Store fees to 15 percent. Google&#39;s normal Play Store cut is 30 percent, but it only charges 15 percent on the  first $1 million in revenue. So this is a play aimed specifically at multimillion-dollar media apps.\n     Video\u00a0- high-quality video content for the living room; requires integrations with Android TV, Google TV, and Google Cast\n Audio\u00a0- subscription music and audio services that work everywhere; requires integrations with Wear OS, Android Auto, Android TV, and Google Cast\n Books\u00a0- compelling reading experience on larger screens; optimized experience on tablets, foldables, and integration with the new Entertainment Space.\n Note that developers are &#34;required&#34; to support the extra form factors in order to get the lower fee. The  Media Experience Program page lists additional eligibility requirements like &#34;Over 100,000 monthly active installs on Google Play&#34; and &#34;a\u00a0strong Google Play rating.&#34; Developers interested in the program will need to fill out  a form in order to be considered.\n Charging less money is definitely speaking a developer&#39;s language, so we can&#39;t imagine this won&#39;t result in some increased form-factor support. It&#39;s just a shame the program is so limited. Only multimillion-dollar apps get a shot at eligibility, and only media apps, and only apps charging real money as opposed to being ad-supported. It would be great if Google could entice other developers to make tablet apps and support other form factors through additional incentives, but this is a good start.\n Google has a lot of work to do here, too.

Along with other  crypto partners, they have issued USD Coin (USDC), a popular stablecoin.\n As the name suggests, stablecoins are cryptocurrencies with a fixed price. One USDC is always worth one USD. Auditing firms regularly check that issuers always keep as many USD in bank accounts as USDC in circulation.\n  The idea behind USDC is that you can manipulate money more easily. According to USDC backers, moving money from one person to another should be as easy as sending bitcoin from one wallet to another. Circle has its own solution with Circle accounts. Account holders can programmatically send, receive and hold USDC using standard API calls.\n In particular, Circle has built ramps to bridge the gap between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. With  Payments, you can accept card payments, bank transfers and USDC transactions. Everything arrives in your Circle account as USDC. Similarly with  Payouts, you can send bank transfers from your Circle account.\n Now, Circle also wants to help you access more features with your USDC currently in your Circle account. With the upcoming DeFi API, you\u2019ll be able to access DeFi protocols without having to manually send USDC tokens to another wallet. Circle will start with the Compound protocol.\n Compound manages crypto-based lending markets. Some users provide crypto assets and contribute to liquidity pools. Others borrow crypto assets \u2014 they first need to provide another type of crypto as collateral.\n Users who lend money on Compound are rewarded with interest rates. For instance, when you supply USDC using the Compound protocol, you get 1.74% in annual percentage yield (APY). As USDC is a popular collateral for the Compound protocol, it makes sense that Circle is embracing the protocol with its business accounts. It\u2019s an interesting addition to Circle\u2019s treasury infrastructure.\n 3/ We&#39;ve created a new API service that allows companies to automate fiat flows, USDC account flows and direct integration with and custody of yield and governance tokens. Our first protocol launch is Compound Protocol.

into whether  Amazon    AMZN  -1.56%  com Inc. and Google are doing enough to crack down on fake reviews, adding a new layer to regulatory scrutiny of U.S. tech giants.\n  The Competition and Markets Authority said Friday the move stems from concerns Amazon and  Alphabet    GOOG  0.65%  Google haven\u2019t been doing enough to address fake reviews on their sites, but added that it hasn\u2019t yet reached a view on whether the companies have broken the law.\n  The tech giants have for years  been dogged by inauthentic reviews, whereby third-party sellers offer financial rewards for reviewing their products. But the practice is hard for the companies to police, with compensation coordinated out of their reach.\n  The move comes amid recent investigations into Silicon Valley\u2019s market power and privacy practices, turning the spotlight to misleading online reviews. The coronavirus pandemic has prompted a shift to online consumption, increasing consumers\u2019 reliance on online reviews to decide on product purchases.\n    The CMA\u2019s decision follows an initial investigation, opened in May 2020, assessing several platforms\u2019 internal systems and processes for spotting and dealing with fake reviews. The work raised concerns that Amazon and Google weren\u2019t doing enough to detect fake and misleading reviews and suspicious behavior, investigate and promptly remove fake reviews, or impose adequate sanctions on reviewers or businesses to deter them.\n    The CMA also said it was concerned Amazon\u2019s systems were failing to adequately stop or deter sellers from manipulating product listings, like co-opting reviews from other products.\n  U.S. lawmakers in 2019 questioned Amazon\u2019s efforts to fight fake reviews in a letter to Chief Executive  Jeff Bezos. The Federal Trade Commission also in 2019 fined a retail website that paid a third party to post reviews on Amazon, in its first case against the use of fake paid reviews.\n  Amazon said it devotes significant resources to preventing fake or incentivized reviews from appearing in its store and to ensure reviews accurately reflect customers\u2019 experience.\n  \u201cWe will continue to assist the CMA with its enquiries and we note its confirmation that no findings have been made against our business,\u201d an Amazon spokesman said.\n  Amazon says it stopped more than 200 million suspected fake reviews last year before they were seen by customers, and that it is taking action against reviews and customer accounts sold on external social-media sites. In the first quarter of 2021, it reported more than 1,000 social-media groups.\n  A Google spokesperson said the company takes action when it finds violations of its policy, from removing abusive content to disabling user accounts, and that it looks forward to continuing its work with the CMA.\n  Facebook  and  eBay  last year committed to combating trading in fake and misleading reviews on their sites, in response to concerns raised by the CMA. In April, the regulator said Facebook had removed 16,000 groups that sold fake reviews on both Facebook and Instagram.\n  The regulator said its probe into fake reviews is part of a broader program to establish a new regulatory regime for digital markets. Last week, the CMA said it was launching a study into  Apple  and Google\u2019s mobile ecosystems and earlier in June said it would have oversight over Google\u2019s removal of user-tracking technology from its Chrome browser under a set of commitments from the company to settle an antitrust investigation.\n  European Union regulators are also ramping up scrutiny for U.S. tech giants. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s top antitrust enforcer, on Tuesday  opened an antitrust investigation into allegations that Google is abusing its leading role in the advertising-technology sector. Google said it would continue to engage with the commission.\n  Early in June, the EU and the U.K.  opened formal antitrust investigations into Facebook Inc.\u2019s classified-ads service, Marketplace. Facebook said it would cooperate with the probes to \u201cdemonstrate that they are without merit.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-25 19:14:52", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name":

But ARIA brings a lot to the table that HTML does not, such as complex widgets and state information that HTML does not have natively.\n  A lot of that information can be hidden to the average developer unless they are checking the accessibility inspectors across browsers or testing with a suite of screen readers. This is one of the reasons I always advocate for making your styles lean on structure and attributes from the DOM, to make it easier to spot when something is amiss.\n  It is also, in my opinion, a way to reduce the surface area for accessibility bugs. If your sort icon orientation is keyed to the ARIA property that conveys that state programmatically, then getting that ARIA property wrong will have two effects \u2014 a broken interface and a weird icon. Addressing the accessibility issue will fix the visual style.\n    None of this is new. Others have talked, written, and coded about it. I have taken it for granted since attribute selector support became widespread in the first decade of the 21 st century. But I regularly work with folks who do not come at CSS from the same place I do.\n  Instead of preaching concepts, let me toss some examples out. Each of these links to a blog post where I explain the styles, how the selector is keying off the HTML, what WCAG Success Criteria they help support, and if there are any gotchas. Please read at least the linked sections of those posts for more detail.\n    In my post   Under-Engineered Responsive Tables I use the following CSS to ensure content is not clipped unless it will be accessible to keyboard users,  without creating a confusing mess for screen reader users:\n      In   Disclosure Widgets, the following CSS only hides content when the programmatic state of the trigger (assuming it is the previous sibling) has been correctly set to convey the content it controls is hidden:\n  button[aria-expanded=&#34;false&#34;] + * {\r display: none;\r}\r\rbutton[aria-expanded] + * {\r /* Don&#39;t need anything here. */\r}\n    When writing about   Sortable Table Columns, I do not go into detail in the CSS but the selectors are pretty clear in their reliance on the sort property:\n  [aria-sort=&#34;ascending&#34;] &gt; button svg.asc {\r stroke: var(--col-header-color);\r fill: var(--col-header-color);\r}\r\r[aria-sort=&#34;descending&#34;] &gt; button svg.des {\r stroke: var(--col-header-color);\r fill: var(--col-header-color);\r}\n    My   Under-Engineered Text Boxen lean on native HTML attributes along with ARIA properties, such as when the state of a control is invalid:\n      Of course I cover the most common one, showing the current page in a set of navigation links, in   Link + Disclosure Widget Navigation:\n      For a twist,   More Accessible Skeletons uses CSS to spackle over a gap in ARIA support:\n      The challenge I run into again and again is with developers who do not know CSS, either at all or very well. Whether they rely on a CSS-in-JS approach, or a class-driven model like Tailwind or BEM, I find they struggle with first understanding the concept of using CSS as I outlined, but then with how to write the syntax in their tooling to make it work.\n  I am not making fun of Tailwind or BEM (though  I may have done that in  the past). I do not know either syntax (nor do I know SCSS, SMACSS, SASS, SFPD, and so on) and am not motivated to since my CSS knowledge is older and works everywhere.\n    I encourage you to read the responses. Much of what I propose above will not work with Tailwind\u2019s structure. Much of the feedback came down to either serving a static CSS file (while watching for layout conflicts) or integrating these styles with an   @layer directive to drop it into the place in the generated Tailwind file where you want it.\n  Phil Wolstenholme started  offering feedback immediately and then wrote a post directly after with Tailwind-specific feedback:   Tying Tailwind styling to ARIA attributes.\n  If you use Tailwind, I encourage you to read it (and then maybe leave a comment there or here with feedback). If you do not use Tailwind, maybe some of those concepts can apply in your tools of choice.\n  Based on the overall responses, and my own digging into BEM, it looks like the selectors I outline above are well outside the scope of what these tools offer. For other tooling, I encourage you to offer your own experience in the comments.\n    Look, I can\u2019t keep giving you free code. Some day I will be dead.\n    Many of the  global ARIA states (but not properties) are great as styling hooks. Getting familiar with  all ARIA states and properties that are available across widgets and other uses can be handy as well.\n  Every time you come up with a style that reflects a state or property of something (open, closed, expanded, collapsed, on, off, checked, disabled, busy, locked, selected, sobbing uncontrollably), do not use a class. At least not at first. Look at the programmatic change that happens to the underlying HTML that makes that thing happen.\n  Try to use that as your styling hook instead. Write it in a way where if that change does not happen, neither does your style.\n    Just as every problem looks like a nail when you are equipped with only a hammer, every layout or styling or widget challenge looks like something you solve with a  class when you choose some self-described utility-first CSS tooling. Or JavaScript.\n  If you use these tools, you still need to know CSS. On top of that, you may need to know the tools\u2019 syntax in order to incorporate any CSS that goes beyond what they offer.\n  If you have a hand in building these tools, please consider how you can promote CSS that promotes and reinforces good and accessible underlying HTML syntax.\n  If you are building these kinds of tools because you only know how to style things with classes, then maybe go back and learn CSS first. And HTML. And ARIA. And WCAG. And accessibility. And maybe throw in some microdata formats too.  Then take that experience into the tool you want to build.\n  As an aside, I have a built-in bias against Tailwind. Not because of the technology; I see this stuff emerge over and over again and they all have a limited shelf life. My issue is with the how its creator chooses to  engage with people online who are not even critics, while  crapping on other approaches  on its home page.  Like a boss.\n  A lot of people like the tooling, and a lot do not. I have no interest in that fight. If you are offended someone does not like your tooling, then you need to maybe choose to define your self-worth by something else. Maybe a sports franchise instead (like we do in Buffalo).\n     You may use these  HTML tags and attributes:  &lt;a href=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;abbr title=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;acronym title=&#34;&#34;&gt;

At 27, his hair was thinning. The software developer realized that life was passing by too quickly as he was hunkered down at home in Hyattsville, Md.\n  There was so much to do, so many places to see. Caballero envisioned a life in which he might end a workday with a swim instead of a long drive home. So when his employer began calling people back to the office part time, he balked at the 45-minute commute. He started looking for a job with better remote work options and quickly landed multiple offers.\n  &#34;I think the pandemic has changed my mindset in a way, like I really value my time now,&#34; Caballero says.\n     As pandemic life recedes in the U.S., people are leaving their jobs in search of more money, more flexibility and more happiness. Many are rethinking what work means to them, how they are valued, and how they spend their time. It&#39;s leading to a dramatic increase in resignations \u2014 a record 4 million people quit their jobs in April alone, according to the Labor Department.\n  In normal times, people quitting jobs in large numbers signals a healthy economy with plentiful jobs. But these are not normal times. The pandemic led to the  worst U.S. recession in history, and millions of people are still out of jobs. Yet employers are now  complaining about acute labor shortages.\n    &#34;We haven&#39;t seen anything quite like the situation we have today,&#34; says Daniel Zhao, a labor economist with the jobs site Glassdoor.\n     The pandemic has given people all kinds of reasons to change direction. Some people, particularly those who  work in low wage jobs at restaurants, are leaving for better pay. Others may have worked in jobs that weren&#39;t a good fit but were waiting out the pandemic before they quit. And some workers are leaving positions because they fear returning to an unsafe workplace.\n    More than 740,000 people who quit in April worked in the leisure and hospitality industry, which includes jobs in hotels, bars and restaurants, theme parks and other entertainment venues.\n  Jeremy Golembiewski has ideas about why. Last week, after 26 years in food service, he quit his job as general manager of a breakfast place in San Diego. The pandemic had a lot to do with it.\n  Work had gotten too stressful, marked by scant staffing and constant battles with unmasked customers. He contracted COVID-19 and brought it home to his wife and father-in-law.\n  When California went into lockdown for a second time in December, Golembiewski was given the choice of working six days a week or taking a furlough. He took the furlough. It was an easy decision.\n    In the months that followed, Golembiewski&#39;s life changed. He was spending time doing fun things like setting up a playroom in his garage for his two young children and cooking dinner for the family. At age 42, he got a glimpse of what life could be like if he didn&#39;t have to put in 50 to 60 hours a week at the restaurant and miss Thanksgiving dinner and Christmas morning with his family.\n  &#34;I want to see my 1-year-old and my 5-year-old&#39;s faces light up when they come out and see the tree and all the presents that I spent six hours at night assembling and putting out,&#34; says Golembiewski, who got his first restaurant job at 16 as a dishwasher at the Big Boy chain in Michigan.\n     So instead of returning to work last week, Golembiewski resigned, putting an end to his long restaurant career and to  the unemployment checks that have provided him a cushion to think about what he&#39;ll do next.\n  With enough savings to last a month or two, he&#39;s sharpening his resume, working on his typing skills and starting to interview for jobs in fields that are new to him: retail, insurance, data entry. The one thing he&#39;s sure of: He wants to work a 40-hour week.\n      The great migration to remote work in the pandemic has also had a profound impact on how people think about  when and where they want to work.\n  &#34;We have changed. Work has changed. The way we think about time and space has changed,&#34; says Tsedal Neeley, a professor at Harvard Business School and author of the book  Remote Work Revolution: Succeeding From Anywhere. Workers now crave the flexibility given to them in the pandemic \u2014 which had previously been unattainable, she says.\n     Alyssa Casey, a researcher for the federal government, had often thought about leaving Washington, D.C., for Illinois, to be close to her parents and siblings. But she liked her job and her life in the city, going to concerts, restaurants and happy hours with friends.\n  With all of that on hold last year, she and her husband rented a house in Illinois just before the holidays and formed a pandemic bubble with their extended family for the long pandemic winter.\n  It has renewed her desire to make family a priority. She and her husband are now sure they want to stay in Illinois, even though she may have to quit her job, which she&#39;s been doing remotely.\n  &#34;I think the pandemic just allowed for time,&#34; she says. &#34;You just have more time to think about what you really want.&#34;\n      Caballero, the software developer, knew when he took a remote job last year that he&#39;d have to go into the office someday. But 10 months in, he&#39;s no longer up for the commute, even just three days a week. He doesn&#39;t even own a car, and there&#39;s no public transportation to his office.\n     The new position he&#39;s just accepted will allow him to work remotely as much as he likes. And so even as he&#39;s fixing up his backyard, building a new fence for his dog, he&#39;s dreaming of a future beyond his basement office, maybe near a beach.\n  &#34;I do need to pay bills, so I have to work,&#34; he says. But he now believes work has to accommodate life.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 19:12:41", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "recedes", "title": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u56de\u6536\uff0c\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u5de5\u4eba\u6b63\u5728\u8bf4\u201c\u6211\u6212\u70df\u201d ", "title_en": "As the Pandemic Recedes, Millions of Workers Are Saying 'I Quit'", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.npr.org/2021/06/24/1007914455/as-the-pandemic-recedes-millions-of-workers-are-saying-i-quit", "via": "", "real_tags": ["recedes"]}]
