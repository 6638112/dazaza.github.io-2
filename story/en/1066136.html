My assumption at the time was that COVID lockdowns could extend as long as five years, the previous speed record for modern vaccine development, with many millions of deaths — a generational cataclysm.</p><p>只有15个月前 -  2020年3月13日 -  Covid-19成为美国的国家紧急情况。我当时的假设是Covid锁定可以长达五年，以前的现代疫苗开发的速度记录，有许多数百万的死亡 - 一个世代大灾变。</p><p> While COVID certainly has been plenty devastating in the U.S. and around the world, with 600,000 Americans dead of and with COVID, and with shockingly broad destruction of American small businesses, it has not been nearly as destructive as it could have been. We are coming out of COVID years early, with many livelihoods and businesses preserved, compared to what we had any right to expect. And overwhelming credit goes to our spectacular technology industry.</p><p> 虽然Covid肯定在美国和世界各地遭到了丰富的毁灭性，但是拥有60万美国人死亡，并与Covid的死亡，并且令人震惊地摧毁美国小企业，它几乎没有像它一样破坏性的。与我们有权期望的人相比，我们早期从Covid yoct of offient of covidih yey出来了。而且压倒性的信誉令我们壮观的技术产业。</p><p> The most amazing COVID technology story has to be the vaccines. Moderna, a product of the American venture capital system, created the first mRNA COVID vaccine within two days of receiving the genetic code for COVID by email. It’s hard to overstate the tremendous advance in both speed and effectiveness of this new technological platform — and now that we know how well mRNA vaccines work, we can look forward to decades of new vaccines both for potential COVID variants and for many other health threats. We now have the technological tools to quite literally code nature, and the payoff to human flourishing will be profound.</p><p> 最惊人的Covid技术故事必须是疫苗。美国风险投资系统的产品，通过电子邮件收到Covid遗传密码的两天内创建了第一个mRNA Covid疫苗。很难夸大这种新技术平台的速度和有效性的巨大进步 - 现在我们知道MRNA疫苗的工作程度如何，我们可以期待几十年来占潜在的Covid变体和许多其他健康威胁的新疫苗。我们现在有技术工具到完全依赖代码自然，对人类蓬勃发展的回报将深入深刻。</p><p> But technology applied to health during COVID didn’t stop there. Coincident with the imposition of lockdowns, the U.S. federal government authorized Medicare to cover the cost of telemedicine, so millions of Americans who could no longer see a doctor in person for a variety of both physical and mental health maladies could continue to receive care. Telemedicine has been technologically viable for two decades, but COVID provided the final push for insurance reimbursement and therefore mass adoption, which I expect to continue. In the decades ahead, state of the art healthcare will be available regardless of geographic location, and we will look back to this crisis as the turning point.</p><p> 但科技期间的技术适用于健康状况。与锁定锁定的重合，美国联邦政府授权的医疗保险，以涵盖远程医疗的成本，这么百万的美国人无法再看到医生的人为各种身体和精神健康疾病都能继续接受护理。远程医疗在技术上是可行的二十年，但科维德为保险报销提供了最终推动，因此批量采纳，我希望继续继续。在未来的几十年中，无论地理位置如何，都将提供艺术医疗保健的国家，我们将回顾这场危机作为转折点。</p><p> By far the scariest non-health implication of COVID was the simultaneous powering down of much of the supply (producer) and demand (consumer) sides of the economy at the start of lockdown. The prospect of a second Great Depression was very real, as reflected in the stock market collapse of early 2020. But then, a miracle happened — a technological miracle. Much of the economy kept operating, and in fact many parts of the economy started operating even better under lockdown than before. The primary credit for this goes to the American worker, but almost as much credit is due to the technology that made this miracle possible.</p><p> 到目前为止，Covid的最严重的非健康意义是在锁定开始时同时断电经济的大部分供应（生产者）和需求（消费者）两侧。第二个大萧条的前景非常真实，正如2020年初的股票市场崩溃所反映的那样。但随后，发生了一个奇迹 - 一种技术奇迹。经济的大部分经济持续运营，实际上经济的许多部分在锁定下开始比以前更好。这是对美国工人的主要学分，但几乎与使这个奇迹成为可能的技术一样。</p><p> The most positively shocking development was that virtually all knowledge work in the economy simply kept going. Of course, companies were forced to shut down physical production facilities such as car factories, and frontline workers bore the brunt of in person exposure to COVID throughout the pandemic. But consider this: Not a single significant company engaged in service provision — whether banking, insurance, communications, media, healthcare, you name it — had any downtime at all. Every knowledge worker went home, fired up their laptops, jumped on Slack and Zoom and Gmail and Github, and kept on going. I must have talked to a hundred CEOs through that initial period, and they were uniformly shocked at how well remote work worked, right from the start.</p><p> 最积极的令人震惊的发展是，经济中几乎所有知识工作都只是继续前进。当然，公司被迫关闭汽车工厂等物理生产设施，前线工人在整个大流行中彻底接触苍白的人。但考虑一下：不是一家从事服务条款的单一重要公司 - 无论是银行，保险，通信，媒体，医疗保健，您都会有任何停机时间。每个知识工作者都回家了，射击了他们的笔记本电脑，跳上了松弛和缩放和gmail和github，并继续前进。我必须通过这个初始时期与一百个CEO谈话，他们在遥远的工作如何从一开始就彻底震惊。</p><p> And the ability to extend work out of the physical realm and onto the internet didn’t stop with big companies. Many small businesses have been destroyed by COVID, but many others have survived and even flourished because of the modern internet. Adoption of online marketing and payments exploded, as many small businesses reached out to new customers virtually and even expanded their businesses under COVID. Restaurants and grocery stores pivoted immediately to delivery and contactless payments, made possible by internet companies like Instacart, Doordash, and Stripe. And many sole proprietors ranging from therapists to fitness instructors to tutors went directly online for both existing and new clients.</p><p> 并且能够在物理领域和互联网上扩展工作并没有停止与大公司。许多小企业已经被Covid摧毁，但由于现代互联网，许多其他人幸存甚至蓬勃发展。通过在线营销和付款爆炸，因为许多小企业几乎伸出新客户，甚至在Covid下扩展了他们的业务。互联网公司（如Instacart），Doordash和Stripe等互联网公司，立即枢转交付和非接触式付款的餐馆和杂货店。许多独资者从治疗师到健身教师到辅导员，为现有和新的客户直接在线。 </p><p> Meanwhile, schools and colleges across the country executed a simultaneous pivot to online learning, typically from a standing start with no preparation at all. This transition was far from perfect, but yet, imagine any such attempt prior to the internet. Notwithstanding the viral meme “Annual Streaming Price: Netflix $108; Hulu $72; Disney+ $84; Harvard $50,420”, teaching and learning continued. Legacy educational systems, which are notorious for their inflexibility, will undoubtedly go back to in person instruction. But yet, one gets the sense that Pandora’s box has been opened. Online education is now a standard part of our world and will boom in the years ahead — not least because many parents saw with their own eyes what their children are being taught by incumbent schools, were not impressed, and will demand new online alternatives.</p><p>同时，全国各地的学校和大学在线学习执行了同时枢转，通常是从站立开始，没有准备。这种转变远非完美，但尚未想象在互联网之前的任何这种尝试。尽管存在病毒模型“年度流媒体价格：Netflix 108美元; Hulu $ 72;迪士尼+ 84美元;哈佛50,420美元“，继续教学和学习。遗产教育系统，对他们的不灵活性臭名昭着，无疑将返回人称教学。但是，人们有意义潘多拉的盒子已经开放。在线教育现在是我们世界的标准部分，并将在未来的岁月中繁荣 - 这并非最不重要的是，许多父母在自己的眼中看到他们的孩子被任职的学校教导，并不令人印象深刻，并将需要新的在线替代品。</p><p> Speaking of Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+, we should not ignore the role that online and streaming entertainment played. Being cooped up at home is not enjoyable for anyone, but there’s no question it’s better when you have a near-infinite range of movies, shows, music, and games at your fingertips thanks to the internet. Roblox, for example, occupied millions of kids while their parents were working remotely, with both gaming and coding. And millions of adults used the internet during COVID to learn chess, cooking, gardening, and a thousand other skills. Life under lockdown shouldn’t have been pure drudgery, and our technology-powered media companies rose to the occasion during an unprecedented boom in online demand.</p><p> 谈到Netflix，Hulu和Disney +，我们不应该忽略在线和流娱乐娱乐的角色。在家里被娱乐对任何人来说都不愉快，但由于互联网，您在指尖的近无限电影，演出，音乐和游戏中，毫无疑问，这是更好的。例如，Roblox占据了数百万个孩子，而他们的父母正在远程工作，玩游戏和编码。在Covid期间，数百万成年人使用互联网来学习国际象棋，烹饪，园艺和千等技能。锁定下的生活不应该是纯粹的苦差事，我们的技术动力媒体公司在在线需求前所未有的繁荣期间升起了这一场合。</p><p> The internet also provided human connection. Our social media platforms delivered under considerable strain, keeping isolated people connected online even when they couldn’t be with one another in person. This mattered most intensely for people suffering from COVID or other health problems through the pandemic. Again, one has to imagine the counterfactual, of a world of only letters and expensive phone calls, to understand how much our modern technology improved our quality of life through this period. Many churches, synagogues, and mosques also went online, along with weddings, baptisms, and funerals, and continued to serve their communities in ways that would have been impossible even a decade ago.</p><p> 互联网也提供了人类的联系。我们的社交媒体平台在相当大的压力下提供，使隔离的人能够在线连接在线，即使它们不能亲自彼此相互伴随。这对通过大流行患有Covid或其他健康问题的人来说最强烈。再一次，一个人必须想象一个只有信件和昂贵的电话的世界的反事实，了解我们的现代技术通过这一时期提高了我们的生活质量。许多教堂，犹太教堂和清真寺也上网，以及婚礼，洗礼和葬礼，并继续以十年前甚至不可能的方式为他们的社区服务。</p><p> Finally, possibly the most profound technology-driven change of all — geography, and its bearing on how we live and work. For thousands of years, until the time of COVID, the dominant fact of every productive economy has been that people need to live where we work. The best jobs have always been in the bigger cities, where quality of life is inevitably impaired by the practical constraints of colocation and density. This has also meant that governance of bigger cities can be truly terrible, since people have no choice but to live there if they want the good jobs.</p><p> 最后，可能是全地理位置最深刻的技术驱动的变化及其如何生活和工作。几千年来，直到Covid的时间，每个生产经济的主导事实都是人们需要生活在我们工作的地方。最好的工作始终处于更大的城市，其中生活质量不可避免地受到定位和密度的实际限制。这也意味着更大的城市的治理可能会真正可怕，因为人们别无选择，只能在那里住在那里，如果他们想要好工作。</p><p> What we have learned — what we were forced to learn — during the COVID lockdowns has permanently shattered these assumptions. It turns out many of the best jobs really can be performed from anywhere, through screens and the internet. It turns out people really can live in a smaller city or a small town or in rural nowhere and still be just as productive as if they lived in a tiny one-room walk-up in a big city. It turns out companies really are capable of organizing and sustaining remote work even — perhaps especially — in the most sophisticated and complex fields.</p><p> 我们所学到的 - 我们被迫学习的东西 - 在Covid锁上期间永久破坏了这些假设。事实证明，许多最好的工作真的可以通过屏幕和互联网从任何地方进行。事实证明，人们真的可以住在一个较小的城市或一个小城镇或在农村无处，仍然是富有成效的，就像他们住在一个大城市的一个小房间里。事实证明，公司真的能够组织和维持遥控工作甚至 - 也许是在最复杂的和复杂的领域。</p><p> This is, I believe, a permanent civilizational shift. It is perhaps the most important thing that’s happened in my lifetime, a consequence of the internet that’s maybe even more important   than  the internet. Permanently divorcing physical location from economic opportunity gives us a real shot at radically expanding the number of good jobs in the world while also dramatically improving quality of life for millions, or billions, of people. We may, at long last, shatter the geographic lottery, opening up opportunity to countless people who weren’t lucky enough to be born in the right place. And people are leaping at the opportunities this shift is already creating, moving both homes and jobs at furious rates. It will take years to understand where this leads, but I am extremely optimistic.</p><p> 这是，我认为，永久文明转变。这可能是我一生中发生的最重要的事情，互联网的结果可能比互联网更重要。永久性离婚从经济机会中的身体位置使我们在根本上扩大了世界上的好工作数量，同时也大大提高了数百万或数十亿人的生活质量。我们可能会暂时打破地理彩票，向无数人开放机会，这些人不够幸运地在正确的地方出生。而且人们在这次转变已经创造的机会上跳跃，以愤怒的价格搬家。这需要数年了解这一领导，但我非常乐观。</p><p> Last April, I issued a call to our technology industry that it was   time to build  — and I am so proud of how we delivered. Please join me in an enthusiastic — virtual! — round of applause for all of the amazing workers in our spectacular technology industry who made all this possible. The experience of COVID has made crystal clear both how important our technology is to human flourishing, and how well we can deliver. Technology helped save the world.</p><p> 去年4月，我呼吁我们的技术行业是时候建造了 - 我为我们如何交付而感到骄傲。请加入我的热情 - 虚拟！ - 对于我们壮观的技术行业的所有令人惊叹的工人的掌声，他们成为所有这些可能。 Covid的经验使Crystal明确我们的技术对人类繁荣有多重要，以及我们如何交付。技术有助于拯救世界。 </p><p>         Views expressed in “posts” (including articles, podcasts, videos, and social media) are those of the individuals quoted therein and are not necessarily the views of AH Capital Management, L.L.C.
