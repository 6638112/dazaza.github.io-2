Engineers push to the main branch and request reviews when they think it&#39;s necessary. In this blog post, I outline how we built an engineering culture that is based on trust and allows us to move incredibly fast.\n  When Petr and I started Raycast, we were sitting next to each other in the same flat for three months. Every day, we built features to iterate as fast as possible to something users want. At this time, we didn&#39;t do any code reviews and trusted each other blindly. If there was a technical question, we solved it in person, committed the code to the main branch and moved on to the next problem.\n When we started to grow our distributed team, we asked ourselves if we should adopt code reviews. Common wisdom tells you that pull requests are best practice in high-performing engineering teams. But we liked the trust, collaboration and speed of our &#34;process&#34; and decided to\u00a0  not\u00a0require code reviews. Instead, every engineer has the right to push their changes to the main branch. They can request a review if they want somebody else to take another look at their code. Sometimes this happens after the change has landed in the trunk.\n  We use GitHub for source control, which comes with the concept of pull requests (PR) for code reviews. Typically, an engineer works on a task and then proposes their changes to the repository. After a discussion and potential changes, the engineer merges their changes into the base branch. This model works great for open source and allows strangers to contribute to projects. However, we found it impractical for our team for a few reasons:\n Pull requests discourage trust.\u00a0Proposing every code change that somebody else has to approve doesn&#39;t feel encouraging for teams that should operate with a high degree of trust. There are more efficient ways to collaborate on code.\n Pull requests don&#39;t prevent bugs.\u00a0Reviewing code is hard! You can catch obvious mistakes, but you won&#39;t have consistent in-depth scrutiny. Many issues reveal themselves only after extensive use, which doesn&#39;t happen during code reviews. We rely on fast iterations with  user feedback.\n Pull requests slow down.\u00a0Code reviews aren&#39;t high priority for engineers. They have to make time to clean up their review queue. In reality, PRs are an afterthought and not what you want to spend your time on as an engineer.\n We value\u00a0 full responsibility\u00a0and all our engineers own features from ideation to maintenance. Our engineering culture reflects this by giving engineers the freedom to push to the main branch and only request code reviews if they think it&#39;s necessary.\n  Our goal is to dogfood changes as quickly as possible. For this, everybody works on the main branch. This produces a constant stream of changes that can be immediately tested by others. Our continuous integration builds and tests every commit. In addition, we trigger an internal release every night which includes all changes that got committed during the day. Each release is automatically installed for the entire team. This allows us to test new changes within 24 hours.\n The daily internal releases make it simple to collect a lot of feedback to iron out bugs or usability issues. If the team is happy with the quality of a feature, it gets released as part of our next public release. If it needs further iterations, we use a feature flag to keep it internal. This workflow helps us to consistently ship\u00a0 updates every other week.\n Side note:\u00a0We use rebase instead of merge to keep a much cleaner project history and eliminate unnecessary merge commits.\n There are some situations when we request code reviews. If we touch a new part of the codebase, we open a pull request. A good example for such a change is adding a database migration for the first time. Nobody wants to screw up the production environment and rather double checks it. Often new team members request code reviews for the first couple of weeks to familiarize themselves with our codebase. Over time, they gain confidence to work on bigger changes and start pushing to the main branch directly.\n It doesn&#39;t always have to be a PR. Sometimes it&#39;s enough to make a teammate aware of a particular change with a &#34;post-commit message&#34;. After somebody committed their change, they link the relevant person in a Slack channel that is subscribed to our repository or on the commit on GitHub itself. This is useful for changes that could affect the work of others. This is also a great way to avoid blocking code reviews due to time differences. If there is some problem that needs the input of multiple engineers, we hop on a quick\u00a0 Around\u00a0video call and use screen sharing to collaborate. This is handy to sort out bigger topics such as refactoring parts of the codebase or aligning on features that depend on each other.\n We found this way of working more effective. It avoids isolated work on long-lived branches and creates momentum through the continuous updating of the app.\n  Every company or team is different, but one thing is the same: They all want to build the best product in the shortest time possible. There are different ways to achieve this. Ours is to bet on our team and give all engineers the trust to do their best job. This includes letting them decide whenever they want their code reviewed by somebody else. This might be not the right process for other teams that have more strict security requirements. So far, this works well for us. It allows us to rapidly iterate on features, attract great engineers who want to tackle big problems, and establish an asynchronous communication culture that fits our fully distributed team.\n It&#39;s up to you and your colleagues to set the rules for your team.

You\u2019ll even learn how to make a lot of money along the way.\n One of  our recent episodes of React Native Radio seemed to have hit a nerve. In it, we discussed how to get a job or get consulting work as a React or React Native developer, and has brought exponentially more emails to my inbox with people either grateful for the discussion, or with questions about their particular situation.\n Speci  fically though, I\u2019ve had quite a few people reach out to me asking questions about getting into  consulting. In my consulting career, I\u2019ve had the fortune of working with companies all the way from fortune 500 (Amazon, Samsung, American Express, Visa), to small startups and everything in between (Warner Bros, Indeed).\n The advice we offer on that podcast episode and the advice offered in this blog post will apply to  anyone in the software field looking to either make a name for themselves, make more money, or to have more control in their dealing with clients and over their lives.\n Why should you listen to me? Well, maybe you shouldn\u2019t, it\u2019s up to you, but hear me out.\n Over the past 8 or so years I\u2019ve invested a lot of time and money into  books, paid mentorships, and paid time to consultants (that already were where I wanted to be one day) for their knowledge, and I am sharing the information I paid for here for free.\n I\u2019ve also managed to make between $200,000 and $400,000 a year for 4 years consecutively while living in Mississippi, a place without much opportunity for developers.\n I\u2019ve distilled the knowledge &amp; advice I\u2019ve received from these specialists and the techniques that have worked for me into seven items:  Building Bridges,  Specialization,  Content,  Flat Rate Pricing, Networking,  Image, &amp;  Learning.\n  A few years ago I was really into  Angular. I attended the NG Vegas conference, and there I saw one of the best talks I\u2019ve ever seen (by  Aaron Frost) that I still think about to this day:  Building Bridges.\n   This talk has helped frame my thought process as a developer and a person for the next couple of years, and implementing the ideas put forth in this talk has been extremely fulfilling both personally and professionally.\n The only reason I am where I am today is because of the work other people have done, the tutorials they have made, the open source projects they have created and tirelessly contributed to. I have since made it a priority to pay my way back in any way that I can.\n Depending on your confidence and level of expertise,  building bridges could look like many things. For me this has been free one on one mentorship, writing blog posts on things that I\u2019ve learned, hosting and paying for a  local meetup for over 3 years, &amp; answering questions on  Stack Overflow among other things.\n Not only does  building bridges help other people, it also helps you. Teaching and mentoring forces you to understand things on a deeper level than you would have otherwise felt the need to address or dig into. Questions that you did not know existed get answered when you are forced to explain something technical.\n   One of the best pieces of advice I\u2019ve acted on is deciding to specialize.\n Imagine that you have labeled yourself as a \u201cWeb Developer\u201d. When marketing yourself it would be easy to get lost in the millions of online ads, websites, blog posts, and general spam associated with this general term. The same goes for other general labels like Back End Developer, App Developer, etc\u2026 These developers end up competing on price, likely spinning their wheels and working with sub-par clients in the process.\n Imagine if you now change your strategy, persona, and marketing to being known as a \u201cProgressive Mobile Web Application Developer\u201d. You\u2019ve drastically differentiated yourself. Sure you will have less people looking for you, but when someone is looking for exactly what you do  you will be the one they want.  But you could and should go even deeper and more specialized.\n Some examples of specialists that I\u2019ve seen excel in the real world are: Python Training, Postgres Database Query Optimization, Mobile Development for Credit Unions, Progressive Mobile Web Applications for Financial Institutions, Cross Platform Mobile Applications for Furniture Stores, Python Machine  Learning Training, Node APIs.\n Being a specialist allows you to charge more, have more control over your terms, and generally work with more respect from your clients.\n You are not losing out on the millions of people that weren\u2019t finding you in the first place, you are instead standing out as a big fish in a small pond, VS a small fish in a large ocean.\n Companies are also more likely to bring you in more quickly and with more money as a specialist because you do not need much onboarding (onboarding that costs them time &amp; money). If you are already specialized in the thing they need you for, you can get up and running on their team extremely quickly, ultimately saving them both time  and money.\n Specialists also become much more efficient at the thing they specialize in. You will be able to build &amp; ship much more quickly, making your higher rate not only justifiable but actually cheaper for your client at the end of the contract.\n I\u2019ve learned a lot about specialization from books like  The One Thing,  The Freelancers Show Podcast, and paid time from other successful consultants.\n  Today  anyone can write a book or blog post or create a video series on YouTube. The more content you create, the more you learn and the more you increase the ability for potential clients to find you. You also position yourself as  an authority on the subject.\n This also allows you to stand out to your competition. When a client Googles your name, who is she more likely to seek out? If you are seen as the authority, the person that teaches your competition, the decision becomes a no brainer.\n This also goes back to \u201cBuilding Bridges\u201d, when you learn something new, give that knowledge away, it helps the community and it helps you!\n This now brings us to training. Offer workshops and on site training in the technology that you specialize in. This often opens the door to new clients, as they will buy training and then realize your expertise and value, and offer you more work on their project as a consultant. Again, this brings us back to what I mentioned earlier: If you are seen as the person that teaches your competition, the sale is already in the bag.\n And this is for good reason. After teaching a couple of classes, you gain a deeper level of understanding and can work much more efficiently. If you can accomplish the job 4x faster than your competition, charging 1.5 or 2x more is still much cheaper for your customer.\n After paying for mentorship and specialists for their time, I\u2019ve realized there are two big secrets in the high paying consulting industry:  training and  flat rate pricing.\n   Say for instance your hourly rate is $125.00, and you are billing 35 hours a week.\n If you work 48 weeks a year, the  max you can make is $210,000.00. Now, this is of course  really good money, but it is also a ceiling that you will not be able to break out of without negatively effecting either your quality of life or quality of work, or raising your rates.\n The solution to this dilemma is flat rate pricing. The gist of flat rate pricing is that  instead of charging for your time, you are charging for the value that you are providing to your customer.\n Imagine that your on site training will improve developer efficiency by 10% over the next 12 months for a class of 20 developers. If each developer costs them $200,000.00 per year, you are saving the company $400,000.00 that year alone with your training.\n It makes much financial sense to charge 10% ($40,000.00) of this amount for your services, even if only takes you two days to complete.\n Imagine if you were to turn this into hourly billing? Your rate would be $2,500.00 per hour were you charging hourly for 8 hour days.\n Billing based on value makes this invoicing and pricing discussion much more digestible than if you were to just come out and say that you are billing $2,500.00 per hour!\n This also applies to software development. If an e-commerce application you are building will bring in $500,000.00 in sales in the next year, then charging 10% to 20% of this amount is acceptable. The same goes with feature implementation. If your feature will save them $200,000.00 in the next year, price with that in mind vs the hourly rate.\n Jonathan Stark has a lot of great advice on flat rate pricing, including a podcast and a book. Check out his website  here.\n  Many gigs won\u2019t work out with flat rate pricing unfortunately. For me, less than half of my income came from flat rate pricing.\n What kind of gigs would I instead opt for billing hourly? If I\u2019m working on a team with other engineers &amp; we are banging out features or improving an existing application by fixing bugs &amp; or adding improvements, it usually makes more sense to bill hourly. So how much can or should you bill?\n  Does this mean gouging the client? Absolutely not. Your time is valuable. At first when I didn\u2019t have any work my hourly rate was low. I started off billing in the range of $50\u2013$75 / hour. As my hours filled up &amp; I started getting more opportunities, I raised my rates.\n Just like any free market you should choose your hourly rate by supply &amp; demand. Raise your rate until the demand equals the supply. I.e. if you are charging $100 / hour &amp; you have another client come in set your rate at $125.00 or $150.00 and see what happens. If you get a bite, propose a raise of your rate for the previous client to $150.00 / hour or move on to the higher paying client. If you have agreed to a certain price for a length of time, don\u2019t renege on your contract but propose the increase once your initial agreement has been completed.\n Does this mean you should abandon projects? Absolutely not. But once your contract is over or if you are just helping out another team then leaving for a higher rate or asking for a higher rate to meet another offer is a smart move.\n In my experience &amp; from what I have seen, the best consultants are billing in in the range of $200 \u2014 $500 / hour &amp; sometimes even more.\n The most I ever billed was $250.00 / hour. Towards the end of my last contracts I was billing an average of $200/hour.\n   Building a network of trusted friends and acquaintances that can help share your ideas and give valuable feedback on your work is an important part of being a successful consultant. Many of the leads I\u2019ve gotten have been as a direct result of my personal network.\n Networking is something I still don\u2019t think I\u2019m too good at though, regardless of how aware and proactive I try to be.\n Some people are really good at conversing with people online. I am always paranoid about saying the wrong thing or something stupid, but I am working on this! Also, imposter syndrome rears its ugly head even after doing this work for x number of years.\n Some people are really great at networking, people like  Kent C. Dodds  Preethi Kasireddy  Ken Wheeler and  Peggy Rayzis are just a few of the many people that come to mind that are naturally good at building communities, and seem to do so effortlessly (though I know it is a lot of work).\n For the software industry, the online network of choice is Twitter. For physical networking, in person conferences and meetups are a great place to meet other likeminded people.\n One thing I\u2019ve noticed is how  kind most of the people in this industry seem to be. If I have any questions or issues, rarely have I reached out with either a question or request for advice and have had a negative encounter with people working in this field. These small connections add up over time, and when you have an opportunity to contribute to their conversation or question in the future, having interacted with them personally in the past is a great icebreaker.\n I\u2019m aware though that I may have a skewed version of these interactions based on my gender and race.\n  Another way to take advantage of networking effects is to take advantage of other people\u2019s networks by providing them free content.\n For example, with Medium, you have the opportunity to guest post on other people\u2019s blogs. I will soon be cross posting to  Michael Jackson\u2019s  ComponentDidBlog, and have had people guest post to our own  React Native Training Blog. The post your reading is cross-posted to  Hacker Noon!\n The way I started the  React Native Radio podcast was by reaching out to Charles Max Wood, the owner of Devchat.tv, and pitching him on the idea for a new podcast. I would do all of the work and pay for the production if he would just let us be on his podcast network, it ended up being a win for both of us.\n If someone has a successful YouTube channel, ask if you can contribute a video to their channel, or maybe think about recording for  Egghead which already has thousands of users.\n  I spent a few thousand dollars hiring trainers &amp; other highly successful consultants that were already making the type of money I wanted to make to get pointers from them. One of the things that I kept on hearing was the question  \u201cWhen someone searches for you online, what is your online Image?\u201d.\n What they wanted to know was how my Twitter, LinkedIn, &amp; other similar online profiles said about me. Do I act &amp; present myself like someone who is a consultant? Does my bio say that I am a specialist &amp; I am a trainer?\n Before I had any clients, I hired a photographer to take pictures of me in an empty room with me in front of a projector with code on it. I used this picture at first to be on my Twitter &amp; LinkedIn profiles.\n They recommended that I change all of my bios so say that I was a consultant specializing in X thing that I wanted to be doing.\n These small changes (pictures of me teaching, changing my bios) immediately paid off. I started getting more &amp; more leads coming in.\n Two of the people who I learned the most from were  Reuven Lerner (Python specialist trainer) &amp;  Anthony Enlish (Business Development Coach).\n  I have made it a priority to spend a chunk of my time every week to learning new things.\n I\u2019m not sure how to quantify the actual benefit from continuous learning, but it has been something I\u2019ve been doing and have been given this advice by many others, so I\u2019m including it here.\n These new things that I\u2019m learning may or may not apply to my current specialization. For example, I\u2019ve recently been diving into Machine Learning (not close to what I\u2019m doing now), but I\u2019ve also been learning Vue (similar field to what I\u2019m doing now).\n It\u2019s hard to find the time to do all of the things I\u2019m laying out here, and learning (many times) gets pushed to the bottom of the priority list. There are a few ways I\u2019ve found to squeeze learning into my day:\n Lunch at my desk \u2014 Some days I eat lunch at my desk. When I do, I usually open up either  Egghead.io or YouTube and watch a quick video or two on something that I\u2019m interested in.\n Audiobooks \u2014 I\u2019m consuming most of my books via audiobooks these days. I use  Audible, but there are many ways to listen, including  Blinkist which basically is like the Cliffs Notes of audio books.\n Scheduling time on my calendar \u2014 I try to schedule at least 2 hours a week (which is still probably not enough) with no other meetings or obligations in order to learn something new and technical.\n  I\u2019ve tried to sum up a lot of what I\u2019ve learned over the past 8 or so years, things that I would have loved to have been taught right away that would have made my life and journey much better.\n One of my favorite books on software consulting specifically, and one that I have read a couple of times and helped me a lot is  The Nomadic Developer, I recommend checking it out if you have time.\n  My Name is  Nader Dabit . I am a Developer Advocate at  AWS Mobile working with projects like  AppSync and  Amplify, and the founder of  React Native Training.\n If you like React and React Native, checkout out our podcast \u2014  React Native Radio on  Devchat.tv.\n If you enjoyed this article,  please clap n number of times and share it!

", "note_en": "We observe that despite their hierarchical convolutional nature, the synthesis process of typical generative adversarial networks depends on absolute pixel coordinates in an unhealthy manner. This manifests itself as, e.g., detail appearing to be glued to image coordinates instead of the surfaces of depicted objects. We trace the root cause to careless signal processing that causes aliasing in the generator network. Interpreting all signals in the network as continuous, we derive generally applicable, small architectural changes that guarantee that unwanted information cannot leak into the hierarchical synthesis process. The resulting networks match the FID of StyleGAN2 but differ dramatically in their internal representations, and they are fully equivariant to translation and rotation even at subpixel scales. Our results pave the way for generative models better suited for video and animation.\n        The first two videos demonstrate the \u201ctexture sticking\u201d issue in in two \u201ccinemagraphs\u201d created using generators trained on the unaligned FFHQ-U dataset. The looping videos show small random walks around a central point in the latent space. Observe how the details (hairs, wrinkles, etc.) the StyleGAN2 result (left) appear to be glued to the screen coordinates while the face moves under it, while all details transform coherently in our result (right).\n      The following videos show interpolations between hand-picked latent points in several datasets. Observe again how the textural detail appears fixed in the StyleGAN2 result, but transforms smoothly with the rest of the scene in the alias-free generator.\n      We note, in particular, how our alias-free generator appears to have learned to mimic camera motion in the Beaches dataset.\n    The following video illustrates translational equivariance, or lack thereof, in several \u201cbridge\u201d configurations, and aims to visually demonstrate the meaning of EQ-T equivariance scores. In all panels, the first image is the result of running the corresponding generator with analytically translated Fourier input features. The second image has obtained from the first by \u201cuntransforming\u201d the pixels using the inverse translation by an extremely high-quality resampling filter. For a perfectly equivariant generator, the first two images are the same, modulo image boundaries (not shown due to light cropping) and numerical noise from the resampling. The third image visualizes the difference of the first two images. As can be seen, EQ-T scores in the 60 dB range are essentially visually perfect. Please consult the Appendix for technical details.\n    The following video illustrates rotation equivariance in a manner similar to the previous video. Our alias-free Config-T, which has only been designed for translation equivariance, fails completely, as expected. The following comparison method is a variant of Config-T that uses a p4 symmetric G-CNN for rotation equivariance. The model shows a cyclic behavior, where the rotation is exact at multiples of 90 degrees but breaks down at intermediate angles Our alias-free Config-R features high-quality, though not visually perfect rotation equivariance.\n    The following video illustrates the aliasing inherent to pointwise nonlinearities (here, ReLU), and our solution.   Left column:  The original bandlimited signal z. Its ideal version (top) is sampled (middle), and then reconstructed from the samples (bottom). As the sampling rate is high enough to capture the signal, no aliasing occurs.   Middle column:  applying a pointwise non-linearity in the continuous domain (top) yields a non-smooth function due to clipping at the zero crossings. Sampling this signal (middle) and reconstructing the function from the samples (bottom) yields an aliased result, as the high frequencies created by the clipping cannot be represented by the sample grid.   Right column:  applying a low-pass filter to the ReLUed function in the continuous domain (top) yields again a smooth function; sampling it (middle) allows a faithful reconstruction (bottom).\n    The below video compares alias-free generators\u2019 internal activations to those of StyleGAN2 (top). Our alias-free translation (middle) and rotation (bottom) equivariant networks build the image in a radically different manner from what appear to be multi-scale phase signals that follow the features seen in the final image. Due to our alias-free construction, these signals must control both the appearance of as well as the relative positions of image features; we hypothesize that the local oriented oscillations form a basis that enables hierarchical localization. Our construction appears to make it natural for the network to construct them from the low-frequency input Fourier features.\n          @article{Karras2021, author = {Tero Karras and Miika Aittala and Samuli Laine and Erik H\\&#34;{a}rk\\&#34;{o}nen and Janne Hellsten and Jaakko Lehtinen and Timo Aila}, journal = {CoRR}, title = {Alias-Free Generative Adversarial Networks}, volume = {abs/2106.xxxxxx}, year = {2021}}\n    Images, text and video files on this site are made freely available for non-commercial use under the   Creative Commons CC BY-NC 4.0 license  .

This is due in large part to their past success in distributed IT development, remote IT operations, and remote maintenance. IT companies have required their staff to essentially do at home what they had been doing in the office years before. Moreover, to meet the constraints of working from home, the demand for IT services has increased across many other market sectors, including retail, entertainment, education, and healthcare, leading to a more profitable IT market.\n    While this news is largely positive for IT companies, the pandemic is also taking its toll on the upstream supply of IT labor, and software developers in particular. These effects could constrain hiring and innovation over the next two to three years. Due in part to travel embargos, limited access to educational loans, and delays in student visa processing, U.S. colleges and universities are observing significant declines in graduate-level enrollments in computer and information science this year. These declines are translating into one-year enrollment deferrals, meaning a temporary, but significant reduction in expected 2021 graduation rates.\n Two years ago, in 2019, U.S. colleges and universities awarded more than 136,000 bachelor&#39;s, master&#39;s, and Ph.D. degrees in computer and information science (CIS).  6 Among which, 35,200 of these degrees were awarded to nonresident aliens, among whom 27,200 or 77% earned either a master&#39;s or doctoral degree, placing these graduates in a higher skilled technology category. Recently, the American Council on Education (ACE) reported a 43% decline in pandemic-era enrollments for international students based on recent surveys.  5 This decline will reduce CIS post-graduates by 11,700 students in 2021, and would disproportionately affect higher-skilled graduates with more than two years of industry experience. While this story is still playing out, we should already anticipate a tighter IT labor market, particularly among higher-skilled technology jobs.\n    Prior to the pandemic, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimated that approximately 1,469,200 full-time software developers were working in the U.S. in 2019, earning an average salary of $107,510. Over the next 10 years, BLS estimates the U.S. labor market will add 316,000 software developer jobs, which is a phenomenal 22% growth rate, or an average of about 31,000 new jobs each year. By comparison, lesser-skilled computer programmer jobs would decline by 9% to fewer than 193,800 jobs by 2029, showing a continued shift in the U.S. labor market toward higher-skilled IT jobs that include the engineering practices of software design, software construction and maintenance. The 43% decline in new CIS graduates reported by the ACE would reduce BLS estimated job growth by 38% in 2021 by leaving thousands of jobs unfilled.\n In our review of published 2018 data from the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), 61% of the top 200 companies that hire graduates under Optional Practical Training (OPT) conduct business in management consulting, and information technology, including retail, finance, and healthcare;  9 see the sidebar  here. This includes popular consulting companies, such as Deloitte, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, and KPMG, as well as popular technology companies, such as Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft. We estimate that in 2018 there were 46,700 new workers authorized under STEM OPT who were potentially working in IT-related fields. If true, then a decline of 11,700 CIS graduates in 2021 could reduce the available OPT-authorized IT workforce by as much as 25%.\n    When labor-supply shortages arise in IT, the impact can negatively affect both productivity and innovation. In a survey of electronic and mechanical engineering and IT firms in Northern Ireland, Bennett and McGuinness found that skill shortages in hard-to-fill and unfilled vacancies reduce firm-level performance.  1 Hard-to-fill vacancies include those requiring more experience and qualifications, such as IT positions that require at least two years of experience, which are reported to be 40% more difficult to fill than entry-level positions. Unfilled vacancies are measured by the raw number of open positions within the last 12 months, which is independent of how recruiters interpret &#34;difficult to hire.&#34; In general, Bennett and McGuinness found that hard-to-fill vacancies reduced productivity levels by 65%, while unfilled vacancies reduced productivity levels by 75%. This productivity loss is amplified when the company has a large proportion of new graduates and inexperienced workers, or when the company has significant investments in R&amp;D, which otherwise drives up productivity when labor shortages are minimal. Substantiating the impact of labor shortages on innovation, Horbach and Rammer analyzed three years of the German Innovation Survey and found that unfilled positions in high skill areas correlates with increased canceling of innovation projects.  4\n Unfilled positions lead to increased churn as skilled employees jockey for better jobs at more attractive companies. What makes a company attractive to a prospective employee is driven in part by the skills that a prospective hire feels they can develop on the new job. Based on an analysis of employment data from over 50,000 workers, Tambe et al. found that IT employees accept a &#34;compensating differential,&#34; such as trading pay for other job attributes, when they can work with novel and emerging IT systems and develop their skills on the job.  7 Furthermore, their analysis shows employees value working on interesting IT systems above most other employer attributes, such as pay and other benefits. They also note that recent graduates who arrived with newer skills in a high-demand job market would have more job options, and thus be more competitive hires.\n    Instead of waiting for positions to become hard-to-fill and unfilled\u2014leading to more lost productivity and reduced innovation\u2014companies can take two strategic steps to attract and retain high-skilled employees: establish a dual career path for managerial and technical staff, and invest in employee education and training.\n In 1988, Ginzburg and Baroudi identified the need to define a non-managerial technical career ladder to complement the traditional management track for promotions.  3 Over the last seven years, we observed that over 50% of graduates of the Master of Software Engineering (MSE) program at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) have entered senior positions. These graduates enter either a managerial track, such as Project and Program Manager or Staff Software Engineer, or they enter a technical track, such as Senior Software Engineer and Software Development Engineer II and above. The technical track encourages career growth without shifting one&#39;s responsibilities to primarily cover management activities. In April 2020, we looked at career paths of alumni who graduated from 2015\u20132017 recording 44 alumni who ascended the technical ladder within their companies, and 10 who ascended by changing employers. Companies that allow employees to move between tracks afford employees more flexibility to pursue skill development within the company versus looking outward for open positions elsewhere. For example, we observed CMU MSE alumni working for a few years as technical leaders, building critical service infrastructure, who later chose to develop their personnel and project management skills by moving to a management track. We also see the converse, though less often: after having managed a team for some time, an alumnus/alumna chooses to re-enter a product or project team as a technical leader in a non-management role. In our discussions with alumni, these shifts were not viewed as career compromises, but as skill development opportunities.\n  Unfilled positions lead to increased churn as skilled employees jockey for better jobs at more attractive companies.\n  Another way to attract and retain employees, and to support internal career advancement, is to engage employees in on-the-job education by providing online learning benefits in addition to pay. One consequence of the pandemic has been large moves by colleges and universities toward online learning. Coursework in artificial intelligence and machine learning, DevOps, and software architecture are now online and taught by the world&#39;s experts in these topics. Online learning opportunities come in different sizes, from one-to three-course certificates to part-time degree programs that students complete over two to three years. In many cases, employees dedicate 10\u201312 hours a week to online courses, while applying this advanced knowledge to their workplace projects. To build such benefits, companies should consider several issues, including: how to allow for flexible schedules that accommodate online classes; how much to compensate employees for course tuition, recognizing these newly learned skills will transfer to their workplace performance; and whether a certificate or a degree program is the right incentive for recruitment and retention. Certificates may be attractive to senior employees, whereas a graduate degree could entice recent hires looking for more experience and seek additional formal education aimed at advancing their careers internally.\n By emphasizing career paths that foster skill development, companies can move to keep employees more engaged with new opportunities that demonstrate their intellect and entrepreneurship. Moreover, providing corporate support for online software engineering education can re-energize a culture of innovation. Together, these investments can help companies reduce their exposure to the effects of this pandemic, while the upstream supply of IT labor replenishes to meet growing demand.\n    It is evident a labor shortage is expected to arrive soon and that it will disproportionately affect highly skilled workers. With an estimated reduction of 11,700 CIS graduates in 2021  5 and the BLS estimated 22% growth in software developer jobs,  8 there could be thousands of positions left unfilled or hard-to-fill. The added difficulty of hiring skilled employees from a smaller labor supply has the potential to cost companies through lost productivity and reduced innovation. The remaining question is how will companies creatively hire and retain high-skilled employees amidst all the coming turmoil? Companies can get ahead of the shortfall with two strategic steps: establishing a dual career path that allows employees to grow, and investing in employee education and training.\n  1.

", "note_en": "It\u2019s been about half a year since I wrote my  originalpost comparing the Librem 5 andPinephone. The original post saw some controversy as well as quite a bit of attention on  HackerNews. Surprisingly, for a market dominated by newtech every year, there remains quite a bit of interest in these two devices.\n Development on both devices continues day-by-day, in small and large parts. I wanted torevisit the devices as a lot of the ecosystem has changed. Further, I think they\u2019ve definitely bothevolved in terms of what\u2019s possible, and more importantly what\u2019s easy.\n   Before being able to actually talk about the progress, I have to give the same disclaimer that Igave in the original article: I\u2019m not testing voice, SMS, or MMS here. As far as I\u2019ve heard fromother sources, calls and SMS  seem to be in working order. MMSd has (from what I\u2019ve gathered, atleast) been a large focus for many projects in the last six months. I try my best not to use MMSwhenever possible, so I\u2019m certainly a poor source of information if that\u2019s a blocker for you toadopt one of these two devices.\n   Between the two phones, the Librem 5 has definitely surprised me the most in terms of actualdevelopment over the last half-year. This has been for both good and bad reasons, but overall I\u2019vedefinitely delved into the phone a lot more than I had the opportunity to lastDecember.  1\n  The Pinephone has been pretty stable for the most part, and hasn\u2019t really changed. I am lookingforward to some of the custom back cases for the phone itself, in particular the wireless chargingcase. It seems quite exciting to me that the hardware can continue to be hacked and improved. Idon\u2019t care much for a keyboard case with the Pinephone, but I am very excited to see how thewireless charging case performs. Wireless charging is something that I definitely miss with both thePinephone and Librem 5.\n I didn\u2019t really have another spot to talk about this, but Ubuntu Touch has of late been maintaininga more up-to-date kernel for the Pinephone on their  kernelupgrade channel. If you\u2019re planning togive Ubuntu Touch a try, do not be afraid to use this channel. Back in January it was much moreunstable, but I think now it is almost better than the official release on  stable. There isprobably some more work involved in getting it ready for stable, and I cannot comment on that hereas I am not an Ubuntu Touch developer. However, my day to day experience with this channel in UbuntuTouch was much vastly improved thanks to much of the hardware being more responsive. Some notablethings on this kernel that do not really work on stable right now:\n Sound switches immediately to headphones when you plug in headphones. On  stable, you can plug inheadphones but the kernel fails to recognize that you\u2019ve done anything.\n  The kill switch for the modem can be used. On  stable if you turn the kill-switch to offposition (i.e. kill the modem) and you disconnect from WiFi because the phone went into sleepmode, sometimes your WiFi and Bluetooth never come back.\n  The screen runs at 60FPS, whereas on  stable I believe it is locked to 30FPS. It makes a hugedifference!\n   No surprises here, I still vastly prefer Lomiri to Phosh. However, Phosh did get some nice-to-haveupgrades. Auto rotation now works, which is very nice. Battery percentages in the Phosh drop-downmenu from the top of the display also now correctly reports battery! These were minor issues inPhosh but it seems that since it is becoming more and more of a default for many projects outsidePureOS that it is receiving consistent love.\n Unfortunately, Phosh still isn\u2019t very fluid, and suffers from many of the same downfalls Icomplained about last time. I don\u2019t have a lot to say here, but I can definitely say that there\u2019s alot of room to grow.\n I did get the opportunity to try out KDE Plasma via Manjaro on my Pinephone. The overall feel wasmuch closer to older versions of Android (in particular, Android 4 and 5). Many of the gestures andinteractions were much more fluid than say, Phosh, which doesn\u2019t have gestures or animations to pairwith those gestures. However, this is definitely the weakest UI / OS / environment out of the bunch.A few reasons in no particular order:\n The screen timeout is too dang short! Seriously, I counted 15 seconds, and the screen starts todim. Further, there\u2019s no setting in the  Settings app to actually control this. It seems like there\u2019s workarounds, but I wasn\u2019t reallyimpressed enough to stick around on Plasma for now.\n  The sofware store isn\u2019t nearly as polished as the OpenStore on Ubuntu Touch nor the SoftwareCentre in GNOME. I think if I were to rank them I\u2019d go OpenStore &gt; GNOME Software &gt; Command line &gt;KDE Plasma. I had a difficult time being able to open it and install apps and updates. It was muchslower, and overall you can tell it had a lot less time put into it. As far as design goes, it wasquite nice! I do like OpenStore better, but mostly it just felt buggy on the Pinephone. Plus, andI may be mistaken here, but there didn\u2019t seem to be a way to get flatpak integrated intoit?  2\n  Default apps and app selection seemed much more limited. Obviously you can install whatever youwant from the terminal (at your own  peril  risk behest), but doing so on a tiny phonescreen is remains cumbersome.\n  There is definitely a bit of a visual distraction with regards to mixing GTK and Qt / KDE apps. Itis quite wild to see such different visual experiences next to one another, and I think theexperience overall suffers for it. Not to say that GTK is the way forward, but given that many ofthe most usable apps today were built in GTK or oriented towards Phosh somehow mean that the KDEexperience is drawn back by that.\n Overall, I felt like my experience with KDE Plasma was pretty bad. I hope to continue to keeptesting it as it seems to be the default for new Pinephone units going forward. I am confident itwill continue to get better over time, but my initial experience was definitely a step down.\n  I believe last time I complained that neither the Pinephone nor Librem had Bandcamp or Spotify appsavailable. This is still true.  3 However, shortly after writing my previous review of thephones, quite a lot of progress on the sound front came about. For starters, an update was pushedquite rapidly to address the fact that microSD cards were not being automatically mounted. Thismakes the experience of just throwing all your music on a high-capacity microSD card more or lessideal.\n Between running  Lollypop on the Librem 5 and running the default Ubuntu touch music app or the default  music app inKDE Plasma, Lollypop is by far the best out of all of them. I did bring upLollypop before, but my experience so far is that the Librem 5 (using Lollypop, not sure if thisvaries based on software) is much, much better than that of the Pinephone.\n To be fair here, the Librem 5 does actually include quite a  fancyDAC in comparison to the Pinephone. When wired in, it doessound better. However, mainly I think the difference I\u2019ve seen is that it manages to play FLAC andother lossless or high-fidelity formats without skips or interruptions. In contrast, the Pinephonedoes sometimes struggle with playback. Its music app should be able to run FLAC flawlessly, as Ihave definitely gotten FLAC to work. However, the music app does have some problems. Certain FLACtracks for whatever reason seem to be unplayable, and I honestly can\u2019t tell why. Other times, theapp will skip like CDs used to, and you\u2019ll miss ~1-2 seconds of a song. Lastly, the app reallystruggles when trying to shuffle through big collections on a microSD card. I have ~60GiB of musicon a microSD, and occasionally the music app will just die when trying to go to the next song.\n Overall, Lollypop on the Librem 5 is the clear winner. I took a long drive to Tulsa earlier thisyear (~10 hours), and I chose to bring the Librem 5 with me to play music during the drive. I had tokeep it plugged into an external battery pack, but overall the sound quality and performance of theapp itself were what you would hope for.\n  One thing I discovered which changed a lot of my experience with Phosh (Librem 5 / PureOS and anyPhosh-based distro for the Pinephone) was that flatpak was so easy to install and set up. For PureOSor any Debian-based distro I believe it is as simple as:\n  After adding flathub as a remote and rebooting, that unlocked quite a number of apps that I thinkchange the experience significantly. For a quick overview, I ended up installing:\n  It seems that many of the apps on flathub are starting to get mobile or reactive-style applicationsupport. The clear winner here is  Fluffychat, because hot-damn this app feelspolished. It\u2019s a full Matrix client with end-to-end encryption support, and can work alongside Element if you use that for cross-signing / messaging on desktop or other platforms.It may seem as if a Matrix client isn\u2019t a game-changer, but for me this is honestly one of the mainselling points of a phone like this: being able to use completely secure and open-sourcecommunication platforms (that are federated, to boot!).  4\n Needless to say, having more apps at my disposal meant a lot. While the default GNOME Software /PureOS Software stores do seem to lack a lot of apps, the above list was quite complete for me. Istill do wish Signal was available on either of these phones, but I\u2019m not holding tons of hope outthat it\u2019ll happen in any official capacity.\n This perhaps might be the biggest reason that I found that the Librem 5 surprised me more than thePinephone. While Ubuntu Touch on the Pinephone still has \u201cmore apps,\u201d the short list above covers avast majority of my needs (along with a web browser).\n  Speaking of apps that exist in Android but not on any Linux distros, Rudi Timmermans had a GoFundMe opened up for bringing Anbox to Ubuntu Touch. It seemslike it\u2019s closed now, but I\u2019m fairly hopeful the work here will translate to being able to get appslike Signal on other operating systems in the future. Of course, Anbox isn\u2019t a perfect solution, andlacks Google\u2019s  spyware security software called Secure Boot. Many apps for regular users (likebanking apps), or critically important apps for power users (like Snapchat) use secure boot toensure your phone is authentic Android (and hasn\u2019t been rooted). I am willing to be corrected onthis, but I don\u2019t think that Anbox includes Secure Boot in any way, so you are limited in what ispossible with it.\n That said, while this is still in its infancy, this is a great example of how all these FOSSecosystems are making mobile Linux a third option to Android and iOS.\n   So here\u2019s where I start being a little more negative on the phones overall. First, the Librem 5.Its battery life is pretty abysmal, and it can get  incredibly hot. I suspect these end up beingrelated issues in some capacity, but first the battery. I unplugged my Librem 5 at ~9:30AM in themorning after charging to 100% battery, and opened zero apps (so doing nothing). The kill-switch forthe modem, was turned off (so modem was disconnected), as was the mic and camera. WiFi and Bluetoothremained on, although I turned Bluetooth off in the software settings. By ~12:30PM or so, my Librem,which had been doing nothing and has no services running in the background, was at ~60% battery.That\u2019s three hours of  screen off time (and no, I didn\u2019t have the lockscreen with the clock on.The display was blank). It\u2019s pretty bad. I\u2019ve repeated this a few times and its repeatable within acouple percentage points.\n Even if I turn the phone on and enable an alarm, and keep it next to my bedside for the entirenight, I cannot rely on the alarm actually firing, because the battery will run out and the devicewill die before morning comes. This phone needs to be plugged in frequently. Fortunately, updateshave made it such that charging the phone is significantly easier and faster than it was back inDecember. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s perfect yet (some AC adapters like my Pixel 3 AC adapter still don\u2019tseem to work that great), but the charging ports on my desk work great. Cable support has alsoimproved, and more cables than just the one that came with the phone can be used now.  5\n Thermals are also a major concern. During my long road trip with the Librem 5, it performed quitewell at playing music while I was driving. However, even with just a little sunlight in my car (andthe AC going), it still got so hot I thought I had burned my hand touching the metal sides. Giventhat I have an Evergreen unit, I think this is something that isn\u2019t going to be perfectly solveduntil a new Librem 5 with a different design exists. Most of the time I work remotely from my home,so it\u2019s not really the end of the world for me, but the bad thermals plus a weak battery story meansthat you can\u2019t rely on this thing lasting all day, and you\u2019ll need to be careful with where youleave it (certainly not in the sun!!!).\n In contrast, the battery life on the Pinephone seems much better across the board, despite beingsmaller in terms of overall capacity. Ubuntu Touch has the best battery life I\u2019ve seen out of thedistros. In fact, my Pinephone on Ubuntu Touch can easily last a day and a half (~35+ hours) if it\u2019sdoing nothing and the screen is off. That goes down with usage (screen-on time is still only ~4ishhours depending on brightness and other configurations), but overall I\u2019ve been more impressed withmy Pinephone\u2019s battery than almost any other Android device I\u2019ve had in a long time. Other distrosseem to be pretty close in terms of battery life, but Phosh seems to be a little worse in most of mytests. It\u2019s not very scientific, for sure, but I\u2019d be skeptical if someone said Phosh outlivesLomiri in terms of battery life by some wide margin.\n Thermals are much better on the Pinephone too, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve actually improved muchsince the last time I wrote about it. Overall, I\u2019d love to see the phone run cooler, but I alsothink that the design of the Pinephone weighs into this quite a bit.\n  To start, the best browser out of all the options I\u2019ve tried remains Morph Browser on Ubuntu Touch.It\u2019s smooth and responsive even on the Pinephone, and feels pretty snappy. I don\u2019t need apps forTwitter or Mastodon on Ubuntu touch for this reason \u2013 Morph is just better.\n In contrast, GNOME Web feels like it\u2019s gotten worse since I used it in December. I\u2019m not 100%convinced this isn\u2019t because I\u2019m getting more frustrated with it over time or not, but it definitelycan take over 3 minutes to load  Hacker WebApp, which I consider to be fairlylightweight. I know that it\u2019s the browser that\u2019s the issue, because while most apps I use on myLibrem 5 (GTK apps, to be specific) are smooth, GNOME Web just consistently sucks. I\u2019m not surewhat\u2019s going on here, as it was definitely better than the mobile-skinned Firefox when I first gotmy Librem, but now it seems to be the opposite.\n Speaking of mobile-skinned Firefox: it\u2019s pretty decent now. Startup times for the app are stillabysmal (15-20 seconds on Mobian on the Pinephone installed on an A1 microSD card). However, onceit\u2019s been loaded it doesn\u2019t have any of the problems GNOME Web does. It\u2019s definitely not as snappyor responsive as Morph Browser on Ubuntu Touch. However, you can install  uBlockOrigin so it\u2019s really a bit of a trade-off in what you might be hoping to do.\n  Well, the Librem 5 still doesn\u2019t have full-disk encryption. Apparently Byzantium, the next majorPureOS release, will bring this with it, but the release date doesn\u2019t seem locked in yet. Moreover,I have yet to be able to tell by trawling through the Purism forums if enabling encryption is goingto require a full re-install. I suspect it will, which means more work for users, but that\u2019s whatyou get when you play with Linux as a hobby.\n I\u2019m also somewhat excited to see how Purism utilizes the smart card reader in the Librem 5 alongwith full-disk encryption. This is one of those things that I\u2019m not entirely sure is worth it forthe cost (I mean, for most folks just having a separate lock screen / encryption password is morethan enough), but from a technological perspective is pretty cool and unique. Nonetheless, they puta smart card reader in there, and that definitely helped inflate the phone price, so I\u2019m hoping itwasn\u2019t all for naught.\n As for encryption on the Pinephone, the only OS that currently makes it easy to enable is PostmarketOS. PostmarketOS is based off of Alpine Linux, and among thePhosh-based distros is definitely my favourite. The installer image allows you to set a separatelock-screen PIN, disk-encryption key, and SSH login. This is definitely the most polished experienceon any mobile Linux today for getting disk encryption. And since PostmarketOS also supports flatpak/ flathub and traditional means of installing software (through  apk, not  pacman or  apt) theend experience from a phone user isn\u2019t much different than e.g. PureOS.\n I am currently thinking that I\u2019m going to abandon Ubuntu Touch for a while on my Pinephone in favourof keeping PostmarketOS installed on my eMMC because full-disk encryption is so important for mobiledevices. Plus, while I dislike Phosh, the app experience of having Fluffychat available means a lotmore to me while the UBPorts team works towards updating and polishing Ubuntu Touch. That\u2019s not tosay that I\u2019ll abandon other distros entirely, but given the current state mobile Linux, PostmarketOSdefinitely is the distro to watch out for right now (even if Manjaro is the official release partnerfor Pine64).\n  This mostly applies to the Pinephone, since I have mostly stuck with PureOS on the Librem 5 at thispoint in time.  6 I seem to have had considerable trouble with installing many of thePinephone distros to a microSD card in the past month. I had thought it to be a case of a flakymicroSD, but after rotating through a few it seems that mostly I was having trouble with Mobiannightly builds, the Mobian May-17 build (official stable at time of writing), and Manjaro Plasmabuilds.\n I don\u2019t think it was the microSD card at the end of the day, because PostmarketOS installed withtheir installer painlessly. I didn\u2019t dig into it too much because by trying other builds orattempting the same build again at different times, I managed to get these distros working. I wasusing one of the following commands for all this, so perhaps this is on me?\n  This was all done with a USB \u2192 microSD adapter, but I always had consistently good luck withPostmarketOS compared to others, so I\u2019m not sure.\n Lastly, I will note that if you want to install to an eMMC instead of the microSD card, Jumpdrive is excellent software and you should use it.You do have to flash it to a microSD to use it with the Pinephone, but it makes flashing images somuch easier. Props to the team of folks who put that together, it\u2019s a godsend.\n  Overall, I think if you look on a day-by-day or week-by-week scale you\u2019re not going to seesignificant differences in either of these phones. However, having had my Pinephone for about a yearnow, and my Librem 5 Evergreen for about half a year, I\u2019m seeing significant strides in a lot ofdifferent areas. I regrettably cannot cover everything that\u2019s gone on in the realms of both of thesephones, but there\u2019s always a lot to talk about because of how much community force is behind bothprojects.\n I still don\u2019t think either of these phones are really 100% daily-driver ready yet.  7 Infact, while I\u2019ve been generally impressed with the pace of improvements from all over I think thatthere are still some critical areas where the phones fall short. For the Librem 5, the battery lifeand thermals are definitely this device\u2019s Achilles heel. For the Pinephone, I think the weakness ofsome of the hardware is problematic and isn\u2019t something that most people would want to put up with.Audio skipping and bugs related to the lack of power in the hardware are definitely noticeable. Thatsaid, this is all somewhat biased since if this was 2009 both of these phones woul\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-24 00:46:17", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u56fe\u4e66\u9986,librem,\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f", "title": "\u56fe\u4e66\u99865\u5e38\u7eff\u4e0ePinePhone\uff08\u7b2c2\u90e8\u5206\uff09 ", "title_en": "Librem 5 Evergreen vs. PinePhone (Part 2)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://thatgeoguy.ca/blog/2021/06/22/Librem-5-Evergreen-vs-Pinephone/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u56fe\u4e66\u9986", "librem", "\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f2dffa4f281f9a5779ba140e5f8690eb.png", "infoid": 1067755, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Deno Deploy\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u5168\u740325\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u591a\u79df\u6237JavaScript\u5f15\u64ce\u3002\u8be5\u670d\u52a1\u4e0eV8\u865a\u62df\u673a\u6df1\u5165\u8986\u76d6\u4e91\u57fa\u7840\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237Toquickly\u811a\u672c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fHTTPS\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u3002\u8fd9\u90e8\u5c0f\u8bf4\u548c\uff0334;\u65e0\u5200\u548c\uff0334;\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ece\u5730\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3JavaScript\u7f16\u7a0b\u3002\n \u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u53d1\u5e03\u90e8\u7f72\u6d4b\u8bd5\u72481.\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u751c\u83dc\u7cd6\u4e2d\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\uff0c\u5c06\u5728\u672a\u6765\u51e0\u4e2a\u6708\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u90fd\u5c06\u52a0\u53ef\u52a0\u8d28\u5e76\u5b8c\u5584\u7f16\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u91ca\u653e\u5c06\u5728\u5409\u5c14\u5361\u5c14\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u516c\u544a\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u6f6e\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u6211\u4eec\u4f30\u8ba1\u5c06\u5728Q4 2021\u53d1\u751f\u3002\n \u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u516b\u4e2a\u6708\u91cc\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u6084\u6084\u5730\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6258\u7ba1\u7684ServiceTo\u8865\u5145\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e39\u8bfaCli.doploy\u6ca1\u6709\u5728AWS Lambda\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u4f7f\u7528CloudFlare\u5de5\u4eba;\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u9f13\u52b1\u4eba\u4eec\u6d4f\u89c8rocinitial UI\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684JavaScript\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u3002\n   \u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u4e39\u9ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668 - \u4e92\u76f8javascript API\u3002 DerwareHello World\u793a\u4f8b\u5c06\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4e0d\u662f\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u7684\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\uff1a\n  \u53ea\u9700\u70b9\u51fb\u51e0\u4e0b\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u5c06\u63d0\u4f9b$ name.deno.dev\u5b50\u57df\u5e76\u5168\u7403\u4e3b\u6301\u6b64\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u3002\u5ba2\u6237\u5c06\u901a\u8fc7IPv4\u6216IPv6\u901a\u8fc7Anycast\u91ca\u653e\u5230\u60a8\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3002\n   \u867d\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7Web UI\u5b8c\u6210\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u4ee3\u7801\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u7f72Github\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9644\u52a0GitHub\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\n \u6bcf\u6b21\u63a8\u9001\u5230\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\u90fd\u5c06\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u77ac\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u3002\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u4e0d\u5230\u4e00\u79d2\u949f\u5185\u53d1\u751f\u3002\u5728\u9876\u90e8\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u5c3d\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u3002 \n\u6211\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3a\u90e8\u7f72\u662f\u6700\u5feb\u7684\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u5728\u672a\u6765\u7248\u672c\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e0e\u4e1a\u7ee9\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u8fd9\u79cd\u5927\u80c6\u7d22\u8d54\u3002\n   \u90e8\u7f72\u652f\u6301\u6253\u5b57\uff0cJSX\uff0cES\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u8fdc\u7a0bHTTPS\u4ece\u201c\u7981\u6b62\u7bb1\u201d\u4e2d\u5bfc\u5165\u3002\u6ca1\u6709\u914d\u7f6e\u4e14\u6ca1\u6709\u6784\u5efa\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u90e8\u7f72\u672c\u8eab\u7406\u89e3JavaScript\u7684Excomon\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5c31\u50cf\u4e39\u8bfaCLI\u4e00\u6837\u3002\n \u4ece\uff06\uff0334\u5bfc\u5165{h};

The service deeplyintegrates cloud infrastructure with the V8 virtual machine, allowing users toquickly script distributed HTTPS servers. This novel &#34;serverless&#34; system isdesigned from the ground up for modern JavaScript programming.\n Today we are releasing Deploy Beta 1. This is the first in a series of betareleases that will be made over the coming months. Each release will addfeatures and refine the programming model. The releases will culminate in aGeneral Availability announcement that we estimate will happen in Q4 2021.\n Over the past eight months, we have been quietly designing this hosted serviceto supplement workflows with  the open source Deno CLI.Deploy does not run on AWS Lambda nor does it use Cloudflare Workers; this is anew system with a unique design. We encourage people to look past the roughinitial UI and explore this new JavaScript runtime.\n   Where possible Deno provides browser-compatibile JavaScript APIs. The followinghello world example will look not unfamilar to browser programmers:\n  With  a few clicks, Deploy will provision a $NAME.deno.dev subdomain and host this server world-wide. Clients will berouted to our nearest data center via Anycast over IPv4 or IPv6.\n   Although one-off code updates can be done through the web UI, we expect mostusers to attach a Github repository and update code through the Deploy Github App.\n Every push to a repository is deployed to an instantaneously provisionedsubdomain. In most cases, deployments happen in less than a second. On top ofthat, we have designed the system from the ground up to minimize cold-starttime.\n We believe Deploy is the fastest serverless system available. We hope to naildown this bold claim with performance benchmarks in future releases.\n   Deploy supports TypeScript, JSX, ES Modules, and remote HTTPS imports out of thebox. There is no configuration and no build step. Deploy understands thesecommon extensions of JavaScript natively, just like the Deno CLI.\n import { h } from &#34;https://x.lcas.dev/ [email\u00a0protected]/mod.js&#34;;import { renderToString } from &#34;https://x.lcas.dev/ [email\u00a0protected]/ssr.js&#34;;function App() { return ( &lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Hello world&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; );}addEventListener(&#34;fetch&#34;, (event) =&gt; { const html = renderToString(&lt;App /&gt;); event.respondWith( new Response(html, { headers: { &#34;content-type&#34;: &#34;text/html; charset=utf-8&#34; }, }), );});\n  The BroadcastChannel APIis a browser API for real-time communication between tabs. This API also turnsout to be surprisingly well-suited for server-side JavaScript:\n  In Deno Deploy, a BroadcastChannel is a way of communicating between edgeworkers in different data center regions. It overlaps the solution space ofsoftware like ZeroMQ, RabbitMQ, and Redis.\n BroadcastChannel is useful in real-time applications like chats and games. In this example, BroadcastChannel isused to build a simple chat system. You can try it out at https://chat.denoland.org.\n   Deploy only handles encrypted traffic. By default all deployments are given a deno.dev subdomain. One may also point other domain names at Deno Deploy&#39;sanycast IP addresses; Deploy will automatically provision a TLS certificateusing Let&#39;s Encrypt. For more advanced users who might want to use a wildcardcertificate, Deploy allows custom certificates:\n   Fresh is an experimental web framework that lets you quickly build highlydynamic projects that don&#39;t require a build step. Fresh embraces isomorphicJavaScript like never before. Write a JSX component, have it render on the edgejust-in-time, and then enhance it with client side JS for great interactivity.\n Fresh does not have a build step - you write your code, deploy it to DenoDeploy, and from there everything is handled by the framework.\n    Deno Deploy is free to all users during Beta 1. If you tryit out, please tell us what you think by opening an issue on our feedback repository.\n We plan to make a series of beta releases to Deno Deploy over the coming monthsas we add features.

We saw a 50% increase in Next.js downloads on npm, from 4.1M to 6.2M, and the number of homepages using Next.js in the Alexa top 10,000 has grown 50%. At the same time, we&#39;ve tripled our enterprise customer base.\n  Companies of all sizes and verticals, from established industry leaders to pioneering startups, are choosing Vercel to build and host their websites.\n Firms like Hashicorp, the inventors of modern cloud-native tooling, choose Vercel. Firms like GitHub, the leading source code hosting solution, choose Vercel. Global 2000 Enterprises like IBM, McDonald&#39;s, and Facebook, choose Vercel. Hyper-scaling unicorns like Patreon, Scale, and others all choose Vercel.\n These companies understand that building great websites is a team sport that requires not only the best hosting, the best developer tools, and the best developer experience, but also, crucially, the ability to empower stakeholders from across the business to participate in building the best possible end-user experience.\n The way websites are built is changing. Vercel, its customers, and its community are leading the way.\n Our mission is to empower teams to fearlessly develop, collaborate, and instantly ship delightful web experiences. We are grateful for the support along the way. Thank you to our customers, community, partners, and employees for making our growth and momentum possible.\n   Vercel has added an additional $102 million of investment at a valuation greater than $1BN. This Series C round is in addition to the $61 million previously raised. The round is led by existing investor   Bedrock Capital  with participation from other existing investors   Accel ,   CRV ,   Geodesic Capital ,   Greenoaks Capital , and   GV .

Buffett Foundation and NoVo Foundation. Back then, Buffett owned 474,998 Berkshire A shares. Today, he said he owns 238,624 shares, worth about $100 billion.\n   \u201cToday is a milestone for me,\u201d Buffett said in a statement. \u201cIn 2006, I pledged to distribute all of my Berkshire Hathaway shares \u2014 more than 99 percent of my net worth \u2014 to philanthropy. With today\u2019s $4.1 billion distribution, I\u2019m halfway there.\u201d\n  Buffett\u2019s resignation as Gates Foundation trustee comes as the charitable organization faces a tumultuous time with the divorce of its two founders.\n \u201cFor years I have been a trustee \u2014 an inactive trustee at that \u2014 of only one recipient of my funds, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMG). I am now resigning from that post, just as I have done at all corporate boards other than Berkshire\u2019s,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cThe CEO of BMG is Mark Suzman, an outstanding recent selection who has my full support. My goals are 100 percent in sync with those of the foundation, and my physical participation is in no way needed to achieve these goals.\u201d\n Bill Gates, co-founder and former CEO of Microsoft, and his wife, Melinda French Gates, announced their divorce in May. The couple, along with Buffett, were creators of the Giving Pledge, a program that requires participants to give away more than half of their wealth.\n   Buffett said his 16 annual contributions to the five foundations over the years were worth $41 billion when disbursed. Buffett is Berkshire\u2019s largest shareholder, owning about 39 percent of the Class A shares, according to FactSet.\n  Berkshire A shares have rebounded more than 20 percent to hit a record high in 2021 as many of the conglomerate\u2019s business recovered better than expected from the pandemic hit.\n \u201cI\u2019m optimistic. Though naysayers abound \u2014 as they have throughout my life \u2014 America\u2019s best days most certainly lie ahead,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cPhilanthropy will continue to pair human talent with financial resources. So, too, will business and government. Each force has its particular strengths and weaknesses.

That might sound like an  international meeting of world smartphone leaders, but it&#39;s an actual device arriving in the US on July 1 for just $199. For this low price point, the phone doesn&#39;t look bad.\n The specs include a 6.5-inch, 1600\u00d7720 LCD; a Mediatek G35 SoC; 4GB of RAM; 64GB of storage; and a\u00a05050 mAh battery. HMD says a full charge will provide &#34;three-day battery life.&#34; There&#39;s a USB-C port for 10 W charging, a 3.5 mm headphone jack, a side fingerprint reader, a microSD slot, NFC, Wi-Fi up to 802.11n, and a hardware Google Assistant button, along with the usual power and volume buttons.\n    It&#39;s notable when an Android phone launches in the US without a Qualcomm processor. The G20 gets the Mediatek G35 SoC, a 12 nm chip with eight ARM Cortex A53 cores\u2014four at 2.3 GHz and four at 1.8 GHz. An equivalent Qualcomm SoC would be something like the  Snapdragon 439.\n Embedded in the phone&#39;s plastic back is a thin\u00a0camera bump containing four cameras: a 48 MP main camera, a 5 MP wide-angle, a 2 MP &#34;depth&#34; camera, and a 2 MP &#34;macro&#34; camera. That seems like way too many cameras for a $200 phone (have you considered  one good camera\u00a0instead?), and these 2 MP shooters are usually just for looks and marketing purposes.\n The phone comes with Android 11, and HMD promises two years of major OS updates and three years of monthly security updates. We can&#39;t promise the updates  will arrive quickly, but at $200, this is still the best update policy you can get. Nokia&#39;s closest US competition is the slightly more expensive  OnePlus Nord N200. For $240, you get a nice upgrade to a 90 Hz screen, but you also get a deficient update plan of one major OS update and three years of non-monthly, semi-regular security updates. Working up the pricing charts, your next major landmark would be  the aging  Pixel 4a\u00a0at $349.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 00:05:28", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot",

", "note_en": "After staging weeks of protest and being called \u201c reprehensible\u201d by a federal judge, 153 workers of a Houston-based hospital system lost their jobs Tuesday for refusing to get vaccinated against COVID-19.\n  Houston Methodist hospital system had placed  178 employees on a two-week, unpaid suspension\u00a0on June 7 for failing to meet the hospital system&#39;s vaccination mandate, which it had set on April 1. The unpaid two-week suspension was essentially the employees&#39; last chance to get vaccinated before facing termination. During that time, some of the workers \u201cbecame compliant with the policy,\u201d a hospital spokesperson  told the Houston Chronicle Tuesday. But 153 did not and either quit during their suspension or were fired on Tuesday. Houston Methodist CEO Marc Boom had previously noted in a letter to employees that 27 of the 178 suspended workers had received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine going into the suspension.\n The resignations and firings end weeks of public protest by the small group of workers who objected to the mandate, which was otherwise largely successful. According to numbers released by Boom, about 97 percent of the hospital\u2019s nearly 26,000 employees are fully vaccinated, while about 2.4 percent received a valid exemption or were granted a deferral for pregnancy or other reasons.\n  Still, the minority fought back vigorously against the mandate. They staged protests outside hospital facilities, and 117 of the workers filed a lawsuit in federal court. The employees claimed that the mandate is unlawful and forced them to be \u201chuman subjects\u201d in a clinical trial of an \u201cunapproved drug.\u201d Among their more startling claims, they alleged that the mandate violates the Nuremberg Code, a set of 10 ethics principles for conducting human trials written in response to Nazi atrocities. In making the claim, the hospital staff likened the vaccine requirement to horrifying medical experiments carried out in concentration camps during World War II.\n    US District Judge Lynn Hughes called the argument \u201creprehensible\u201d and roundly rejected the hospital worker\u2019s other claims. In  a searing five-page ruling issued on June 12, Judge Hughes dismissed the case, writing that the workers included false claims, \u201cmisrepresented facts,\u201d misconstrued laws, and otherwise provided invalid arguments in the case. He rejected the suggestion that hospital staff were human subjects in a trial and said that the hospital system\u2019s leaders were merely \u201ctrying to do their business of saving lives without giving them the COVID-19 virus.\u201d \u00a0He also noted that on May 28, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission determined that employers can mandate COVID-19 vaccination if they give reasonable accommodations.\n The 117 employees, led by nurse Jennifer Bridges, have already appealed the dismissal to the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals.\n Bridges, a nurse who had worked at the hospital for over six years and had worked in the coronavirus unit during the pandemic, t old the Associated Press that she was fired Tuesday along with some of her like-minded colleagues.\n \u201cWe all knew we were getting fired today,\u201d Bridges told the AP. \u201cWe knew unless we took that shot to come back, we were getting fired today.

Traditionally, big tech companies have been some of the more innovative in addressing that issue, with a number of them also open sourcing their technology to make it usable by others.\n  The breakthrough for the founders of Acryl \u2014 discovered before they started the company, when they were still working at their respective big tech companies \u2014 was the realization that metadata held the key to organizing that big data information.\n \u201cThe interesting part about metadata is actually that it has become a big data problem,\u201d said Shirshanka Das, the LinkedIn alum who is CEO and co-founded the company with Swaroop Jagadish (the Airbnb alum who is CTO). \u201cAnd so all of the data infrastructure DNA that we have, in terms of building large-scale data collections, streaming, indexing, searching \u2014 those all need metadata management solutions that can actually scale to the demands of the modern enterprise. That, I think, is really our secret sauce, that we\u2019ve been able to build a metadata platform that takes in all the best practices of doing data infrastructure right, and applied it to doing metadata infrastructure.\u201d\n As an open source project, DataHub has picked up some significant traction. In addition to LinkedIn itself, Expedia, Saxo Bank, Klarna and many others are using the framework \u2014 essentially a generalized metadata search and discovery tool \u2014 to build their own metadata graph to connect their various data entities together. Altogether the project has racked up  over 3,200 GitHub stars and has more than a 100 contributors.\n Acryl Data, like other open source commercialization efforts, is setting out to build a toolset that will make that framework easier to scale and apply in more use cases, particularly at those companies that might lack the resources to build these implementations on their own. The first of these, it says, will be a data catalogue that is based on design learnings from Airbnb\u2019s Dataportal. LinkedIn will be collaborating with Acryl Data, along with the wider open source community, on future products.\n \u201cLinkedIn\u2019s unique view of the global economy provides us with the opportunity to improve economic outcomes for hundreds of millions of people around the world through data-driven insights and AI-powered products. To discover the right data, navigate the tens of thousands of derived datasets that our researchers and engineers use every day and manage them well, we rely on DataHub,\u201d said\u00a0Igor Perisic, Chief Data Officer at LinkedIn, in a statement. \u201cWe are excited to partner with Acryl Data to continue to advance DataHub with them.\u201d\n The opportunity is a big one.  Collibra, a competitor in the same space, last year raised a round at a $2.3 billion valuation. Another, Alation, was  valued at $1.2 billion earlier this month.

Read it  every morning on Extra Crunch or get  The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.\n  SentinelOne\u2019s IPO, expected to price on June 29 and trade June 30, is a fascinating debut. Why? Because the company sports a combination of rapid growth and expanding losses that make it a good heat-check for the IPO market. Its debut will allow us to answer whether public investors still value growth above all else. And this week, the company gave us an early dataset regarding its market value in the form of an IPO price range. This means we can do some unpacking and thinking.\n A reminder regarding why we dwell on the exit market for unicorns: We care because the value of late-stage startups when they reach a liquidity point helps set valuation comps for myriad smaller startups. Furthermore, the level of public-market enthusiasm for loss-making, growth-focused companies will determine the scale of returns for many a venture capitalist, founder, and early employee.\n So, let\u2019s talk about SentinelOne\u2019s cybersecurity IPO price range; Sprinklr\u2019s social-media software debut will play foil.\n  It can make good sense to pay up for a quickly growing company\u2019s shares. This is why you may hear of a startup raising an early-stage round at a very high revenue multiple.\n Why put a $50 million price tag on a startup that just crossed the $1 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) threshold? If it\u2019s growing sufficiently quickly, the math can pencil out. If that startup was growing at 300% per year, say, the revenue multiple that you paid in the round valuing the startup at $50 million would fall sharply over the next year, at which point other investors would probably scramble to put more capital into the firm at a higher price.\n Bingo! You just got a markup on your initial investment, and the company has found someone else to lead their next round at a higher price, giving it even more capital to keep its growth game going and make your early investment appear prescient. See? Venture capital is easy. 1\n The same general idea applies to companies going public. Growth matters, and the more rapidly a company is adding revenue, the more money it will be worth because investors can anticipate its future scale (within reason).

It\u2019s now launching its third and largest fund to date and says it will invest over $100 million in UK, European, and US-based growth-stage tech companies over the next three years. Its focus will be Seed/ Round A / Round B investments. It intends to invest in the range of $2-5 million and will be focused on software, IT, and internet technologies\n The new fund will to hone in on East European and Russian-speaking entrepreneurs. Particularly those operating out of international hubs such as London and New York.\n  Leta\u2019s founder and former tech entrepreneur Alexander Chachava says Russian-speaking startups based abroad are often \u2013 these days \u2013 over-looked and under-valued by Western VCs and investors, and I dare say he\u2019s right. Prejudice isn\u2019t just about skin color, as we all know.\n Chachava says his fund has invested over $45 million to date since 2012, going into 30 technology companies including Synthesis AI, Unigine, InDriver, NovaKid (which I  covered last year) and 365Scores.\n Exits include the sale of Bright Box HK to Zurich Insurance Group in 2017, and WeWork\u2019s acquisition of sales and marketing platform Unomy.\n Chachava said: \u201cWhile we are significantly broadening our geographic focus towards key global hubs, our strategy effectively remains the same: to identify exciting, high-potential technology start-ups and entrepreneurs, and support them in realizing their international ambitions.\u201d\n Chachava says his own research suggests there are in excess of 17,000 Russian-speaking and East European tech entrepreneurs and start-ups active in the UK, Europe, and US.\n \u201cOur analysis shows they continue to be undervalued and overlooked for funding, despite often generating significant cash when it comes to ARR. These entrepreneurs are some of the most dynamic and technically skilled in the world, and for investors, they represent a massive untapped opportunity.\u201d\n He has a point. Significant businesses such as Telegram, Revolut, TradingView, PandaDoc, and Preply were all started by Russian speakers who are emigres from their respective Russian-influenced countries.\n Leta says its first \u201cevergreen\u201d fund of $15 million was fully deployed in early 2020, delivering a gross IRR of 27% per annum to investors. Its second $50 million fund had its first closing in September 2018 and has committed about 60% of its capital, says the company.\n Leta will invest out of an entity in the Cayman Islands, but doesn\u2019t plan to have an office right now, and nor will it need it to invest.\n As Chachava told me over a Zoom call: \u201cThe last two years, we have not been not traveling too much, our work has been downgraded to Zoom calls. But before that, we spent a couple of months in the US, a couple of months in Western Europe. I was a frequent visitor to London but I don\u2019t think we need space anymore in our modern world.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-24 00:03:30", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af,capital,\u4f01\u4e1a\u5bb6", "title": "1\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143......
