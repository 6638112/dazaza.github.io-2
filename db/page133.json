The Federal Bureau of Investigation reported a  225% increase in total losses from ransomware in the United States in 2020. According to Cybersecurity Ventures, businesses are under attack every 11 seconds, on average, and damage losses are projected to  reach $20 billion worldwide. Against this backdrop, the Cybereason Global Ransomware Study measured how much financial and reputational damage these attacks wreak on businesses.\n Dealing with the aftermath of a ransomware attack can be complicated and costly. The vast majority of organizations experienced  significant business impact due to ransomware attacks, including loss of revenue (66%), damage to the organization\u2019s brand (53%), unplanned workforce reductions (29%), and even closure of the business altogether (25%).\n   After an organization experienced a ransomware attack, the top 5 solutions implemented included security awareness training (48%), security operations (SOC) (48%), endpoint protection (44%), data backup and recovery (43%), and email scanning (41%).\u00a0The least deployed solutions post-attack included web scanning (40%), endpoint detection and response (EDR) and extended detection and response (XDR) technologies (38%), antivirus software (38%), mobile and SMS security solutions (36%), and managed security services provider (MSSP) or managed detection and response (MDR) provider (34%). Only 3% of respondents said they did not make any  new security investments after a ransomware attack.\n Cybereason\u2019s study found that the majority of organizations that chose to pay ransom demands in the past were not immune to subsequent ransomware attacks, often by the same threat actors. In fact, 80% of organizations that paid the ransom were hit by a second attack, and almost half were hit by the same threat group.\n This study offers insight into the business impact of ransomware attacks across key industry verticals and reveals data that can be leveraged to improve ransomware defenses. For example, after an organization experienced a ransomware attack, the top two solutions implemented included security awareness training (48%) and security operations (48%). This research underscores that prevention is the best strategy for managing ransomware risk and ensuring your organization does not fall victim to a ransomware attack in the first place.\n 1,263 cybersecurity professionals took part in the study commissioned by Cybereason and fielded by Censuswide, with participants in varying industries from the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, France, United Arab Emirates, and Singapore.\n  VentureBeat&#39;s mission is to be a digital town square for technical decision-makers to gain knowledge about transformative technology and transact.Our site delivers essential information on data technologies and strategies to guide you as you lead your organizations.

Katie Brown signed   House Bill 2574 into law on Tuesday, adding natural organic reduction to the range of approved after-life options in the west coast state. Sponsored and developed by Rep. Pam Marsh (D - Southern Jackson County), the bill met Oregonians\u2019 growing interest in sustainable alternatives to traditional deathcare.\n    \u201cThis is a hard issue for people to think about; it&#39;s not a decision that any of us get to avoid,\u201d Marsh told Motherboard over the phone. \u201cIt has an appeal, certainly not to all consumers, but to many of us who are really looking for ways to think about how our footprint on the earth continues after life is gone.\u201d\n  The move heeds a   growing call from environmentalists across the country to clean up the end-of-life industry. The most common methods of body disposal come with hefty environmental impacts: traditional burials, in which a corpse is embalmed with formaldehyde and placed in a casket underground, permanently   occupy large swaths of land and have been found to   leach toxins into nearby soil and waterways. Cremation\u2013in which a body is burned into ash\u2014is an energy suck and emits damaging   pollutants and   carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming.\n  By comparison, the process of so-called   natural organic reduction, which breaks down the body into soil, has a small environmental footprint. For example,   Recompose,   the country\u2019s first human composting funeral home does it like this: a corpse is placed in a cylinder with organic materials, like wood chips, plants, and straw, then heated and turned repeatedly for several weeks with a hook until it\u2019s broken down into a nutrient-rich soil that can be delivered back to the family or used for planting.\n   Human composting is the latest of a handful of environmental deathcare options to gain traction across the country as available   cemetery space declines and emissions from cremation mount .\n  Before human composting gained traction,   green burials\u2014in which the body is prepared without chemicals and planted underground in an organic, biodegradable container, often underneath a tree sapling\u2014emerged in 1998 as an alternative to traditional high-impact burial methods, according to the   Green Burial Council. Lauded as an environmentally superior deathcare method, it also makes reckoning with death easier for some. It\u2019s a difficult topic, says Jodie Buller, board member of the Conservation Burial Alliance, but knowing that you or a loved one can die sustainably\u2014through composting or green burials\u2014makes it easier to handle.\n  \u201cIt feels like a very peaceful option,\u201d Buller said. \u201cThe idea that the soil that someone becomes then can be used to nourish plants feels really good to people. It helps break down some of that taboo around death and dying.\u201d\n  Oregon\u2019s law, slated to go into effect in July, 2022, follows similar momentum in neighboring states. Washington became the first in the U.S. to legalize natural organic reduction in   2019, which led to the   opening of   Recompose.

 video) and over 100 augmentations. Each modality\u2019s augmentations are contained within its own sub-library. These sub-libraries include both function-based and class-based transforms, composition operators, and have the option to provide metadata about the transform applied, including its intensity.\n AugLy is a great library to utilize for augmenting your data in model training, or to evaluate the robustness gaps of your model! We designed AugLy to include many specific data augmentations that users perform in real life on internet platforms like Facebook&#39;s -- for example making an image into a meme, overlaying text/emojis on images/videos, reposting a screenshot from social media. While AugLy contains more generic data augmentations as well, it will be particularly useful to you if you&#39;re working on a problem like copy detection, hate speech detection, or copyright infringement where these &#34;internet user&#34; types of data augmentations are prelevant.\n  To see more examples of augmentations, open the Colab notebooks in the README for each modality! (e.g. image  README &amp;  Colab)\n        Or clone AugLy if you want to be able to run our unit tests, contribute a pull request, etc:\n git clone git@github.com:facebookresearch/AugLy.git[Optional, but recommended] conda create -n augly  &amp;&amp; conda activate augly  &amp;&amp; conda install pippip install -e AugLy/\n NOTE: In some environments,  pip doesn&#39;t install  python-magic as expected.

", "note_en": "In the database field and information retrieval in general, there is a very common scenario. I have a list of (sorted) integers that I want to store, and I want to do that in an as efficient a manner as possible. There are dozens of methods to do this and this is a hot topic for research. This is so useful because there are so many places where you can operate on a sorted integer list and gain massive benefits. Unlike generic compression routines, we can usually take advantage of the fact that we understand the data we are trying to work with and get better results.\n The reason I need to compress integers (actually, int64 values) is that I\u2019m trying to keep track of matches for some data, so the integers that I\u2019m tracking are actually file offsets for user\u2019s data inside of Voron. That lead to a few different scenarios that I have to deal with:\n  I\u2019m trying to figure out what is the best way to store the later two options in as efficient manner as possible.\n The first stop was  Daniel Lemire\u2019s blog, naturally, since he has wrote about this extensively. I looked at the following schemes: FastPFor and StreamVByte. They have somewhat different purposes, but basically, FastPFor is using a bits stream while StreamVByte is using byte oriented mode. Theoretically speaking, you can get better compression rate from FastPFor, but StreamVByte is supposed to be faster. Another integer compression system come from the Gorilla paper from Facebook, that is a bigger scheme, which include time series values compression. However, part of that scheme talks about how you can compress integers (they use that to store the ticks of a particular operation). We are actually using that for the time series support inside of RavenDB.\n I\u2019m not going to cover that in depth, here  is the paper on Gorilla compression, the relevant description is at section 4.1.1. Suffice to say that they are using a bit stream and delta of deltas computation. Basically, if you keep getting values that are the same distance apart, you don\u2019t need to record all the value, you can compute that naturally. In the best case scenario, Gorilla compression needs a single bit per value, assuming the results are spaced similarly.\n For my purpose, I want to get as high a compression rate as possible, and I need to store just the list of integers. The problem with Gorilla compression is that if we  aren\u2019t getting numbers that are the same distance apart, we need to record the  amount that they are different. That means that at a minimum, we\u2019ll need a minimum of 9 bits  per value. That adds up quickly, sadly.\n On the other hand, with PFor, there is a different system. PFor computes the maximum number of bits required for a  batch of integer, and then record just those values. I found the Binary Packing section (2.6) in  this paper to be the clearest explanation on how that works exactly.\u00a0 The problem with PFor, however, is that if you have a single large outlier, you\u2019ll waste a lot of bits unnecessarily.\n I decided to see if I can do something about that and created an encoder that works on batches of 128 integers at a time. This encoder will:\n Check the maximum number of bits required to record the  deltas of the integers. That along already saves us a lot.\n Then we check the top and bottom halves of the batch, to see if we\u2019ll get a benefit from recording them separately. A single large value (or a group of them) that is localized to a part of the batch will be recorded independently in this case.\n Finally, instead of only recording the meaningful bit ranges, we\u2019ll also analyze the batch we get further. The idea is to try to find ranges within the batch that have the same distance from one another. We can encode those as repetitions instead of each independent value. That can end up saving a surprisingly amount of space.\n You can look at the results of  my research here. I\u2019ll caution you that this is raw, but the results are promising. I\u2019m able to beat (in terms of compression rate) the standard PFor implementation by a bit, with a  lot less code.\n I\u2019m also looking at a compression rate of 30% \u2013 40% for realistic data sets. And if the data is setup just right and I\u2019m able to take advantage of the repeated delta optimization, I can pack things  real tight.\n Currently numbers say that I can push upward of 10,000 int64 values in an 8KB buffer without any repeated deltas. It goes to just under 500,000 int64 values in an 8KB buffer if I can take full advantage of the deltas.\n The reason I mention the delta so often, it is very likely that I\u2019ll record values that are roughly the same size, so we\u2019ll get offsets that are the same space from one another. In that case, my encoder goes to town and the compression rate is basically crazy.\n This is a  small piece of a much larger work, but this is the first time in a while that I got to code at Voron\u2019s level.

[1] The extreme temperatures in Antarctica \rnecessitated large amounts of fuel oil to maintain operations, making \rthe prospect of nuclear power, an attractive alternative. [1] During its \r10 year lifetime, the nuclear power station produced over 78 million \rkilowatt hours of electricity and produced 13 million gallons of fresh \rwater using the excess steam in a desalination plant. [1] Though this \rdevice reduced the necessity for fuel imports, it was plagued with \rproblems which ultimately forced its early retirement in 1972. The cost \rassociated with nuclear power in the Antarctic made it impractical, and \rdiesel-electric generators have since powered the base. [1] The PM-3A \rnuclear reactor that powered McMurdo Station stands as the only nuclear \rpower station to operate on the Antarctic continent.\n    The ice-free southern tip of the Hut Point Peninsula \ron Ross Island in Antarctica has a history of over 100 years of \rexploration and scientific history and is the site of the present day \rMcMurdo Station. [2] This site is located just 729 nautical miles from \rthe South Pole and is where Robert F. Scott staged the first expedition \rto the South Pole in 1902. [2] The United States established a permanent \rbase at this site beginning in December 1955 as part of Operation Deep \rFreeze I. [2] Known as Naval Air Facility McMurdo, this site was to \rserve as a sea port and logistics base from which to build and support a \rresearch facility at the geographic South Pole. [2] The name McMurdo was \rchosen to honour a lieutenant on the British ship HMS Terror that \rdiscovered Ross Island on an Antarctic expedition in 1841. [2] In 1958, \rthe site was renamed to McMurdo Station and has since maintained the \rability to support a population of over 1200 people. [2] McMurdo Station \rserves as the hub for activity in the Antarctic and is currently \roperated by the United States Antarctic Program (USAP), a division of \rthe Nation Science Foundation (NSF). [2]\n      The decision to install a nuclear power station at \rMcMurdo station was based on several factors. [3] First, there were \rdifficulties associated with supplying the large fuel demands required \rfor operations. Aircraft, diesel-electric generators, heating units, and \rvarious types of land vehicles consumed fuel in excess of half of the \rtotal freight delivered to Antarctica in the late 1950s. [3] To further \rcomplicate supply chain logistics, McMurdo can only be accessed by \rsupply ships during the aural summer months (summer in the southern \rhemisphere), thus requiring all supplies for the entire year to be \rdelivered during this short time frame. [3] It was concluded that an \rincreased supply of electricity from nuclear power would give rise to a \rmore efficient use of freight, reduced costs, as well as electric \rheating to replace the fire hazards associated with oil-fired heating \runits. [3] In addition, experience would be gained from installing and \roperating a nuclear power plant in an isolated and harsh environment. \r[3]\n  In August 1960, the United States Congress authorized \rthe design and construction of a nuclear reactor for McMurdo. [3] That \rsame month, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission contracted the Martin \rMarietta Company of Baltimore, Maryland to design, fabricate, test, \rpackage, transport, install, and initially operate the PM-3A (A for \rAntarctic) nuclear reactor on site in Antarctica. [4] The PM-3A reactor \ris a portable, medium sized nuclear reactor, the third of its type. [4] \rTwo others of this type were built and fielded prior to the PM-3A. [4] \rThe first was the PM-1, also built by Martin, which was used to power a \rremote radar station in Wyoming as part of the North American Aerospace \rDefense Command (NORAD). [4] The PM-2A (A for Arctic) was built by the \rAmerican Locomotive Company to power the remote US military base known \ras Camp Century setup in Northern Greenland. [4] Each of these reactors \rwas in the 1.25-2.0 MW power range, PM-1 and PM-3A were operational by \r1962, with PM-2A being operational in 1960. [4]\n    Fig. 3: Components of the PM-3A arriving at McMurdo. \r (Source:  United States\r Antartcia Program. Courtesy of the\r  NSF)\n  The PM-3A nuclear reactor was above all meant to be \rportable as it was designed with the LC-130 aircraft in mind as its \rdelivery system. [3] Although McMurdo is accessible by ship, it was \roriginally thought that this reactor would power bases inland such as \rthat located at the South Pole which are accessible only by aircraft. \r[3] For reliability and transportability reasons, the PM-3A was designed \rto be a pressurized water reactor. [3] Its core utilized highly enriched \ruranium, 93.1% in relative amount of the isotope U-235, whose fuel \rassembly was roughly the size of an oil drum. [5] Fig. 2 shows the \rinstallation of the PM-3A core onsite. The reactor arrived in modules at \rMcMurdo in December of 1961 by way of the USNS Arneb. [3] Fig. 3 shows \rone of the nuclear reactor modules being unloaded at McMurdo. The PM-3A \rwas assembled on a foundation of solid volcanic rock at an altitude of \r300 feet on the side of Observation Hill, a site that overlooks McMurdo \rStation. [3] Fig. 4 shows the completed reactor site overlooking McMurdo \rStation.\n  The PM-3A was operated by the Naval Nuclear \rPropulsion Unit consisting of a crew of 25. [3] The reactor went \rcritical in March of 1962 and supplied useful electricity to McMurdo in \rJuly of 1962. [3] It took a total of 23 months to complete testing and \rdebugging of the PM-3A nuclear plant. [3] After this time, control of \rthe plant was turned over from the Martin Company to the US Navy. [3] \rOnce fully operational, the role of the plant was twofold, to produce \relectricity for McMurdo in the amount of 1.8 MW as well as to produce \rsteam to operate a desalination plant for the production fresh drinking \rwater in the amount of 14,000 gallons per day. [3]\n    With a total of 438 malfunctions during its \roperational lifetime from 1964 to 1972, the reactor at McMurdo proved to \rbe an unreliable source of power generation, available only 72% of the \rtime. [1] Because of this, in May of 1972, it was determined by an \rindependent assessment from the Bechtel Corporation that the PM-3A was \rnot cost effective and that replacement with modern diesel-electric \rgenerators would require less staff and would also be more reliable. [1] \rIn September 1972, the PM-3A was shut down for routine maintenance and \rinspection. [1] It was determined that conditions existed in the system \rfor chloride stress corrosion cracking, a situation where sudden failure \rcan occur in normally ductile materials under tension in a corrosive \renvironment. [1,6] Inspection of a an accessible section of pipe \rrevealed no incidences of this occurring, however, the Navy refused to \rrule out cracking on surfaces which could not be inspected and thus \rcalled for a full dismantling and inspection of the reactor before it \rcould be deemed safe. [1] The cost associated with this full inspection \rand possible repair of reactor components was a major factor in the \rdecision to decommission the plant. [1]\n    After 10 years of operation, the PM-3A was \rpermanently shut down in 1972, achieving only half of the expected \rdesign life of 20 years. [1] The next step was clean up of the reactor \rsite. The PM-3A and generated radioactive waste could not remain at \rMcMurdo due to the internationally agreed upon Antarctic Treaty which \rprevents both nuclear weapons testing as well as nuclear waste dumping \rin the Antarctic. [7] As such, a large-scale effort was undertaken to \rremove the reactor components, buildings, and contaminated soil for a \rtotal of 365 metric tons of radioactive waste to the continental United \rStates. [7] It was later determined that there were indeed cracks in the \rcontainment vessel which leaked coolant water into the crushed gravel \rthat had been used as the reactor shield which is what resulted in such \ra large area of contamination. [4] As such, more than 9000 cubic meters \rof contaminated soil was relocated to the continental US. [1] In total, \rseven enriched uranium fuel cores were shipped to McMurdo, three of \rwhich had yet to be used as the plant was expected to operate for \rseveral more years. [7] The reactor cores, components, and highly \rradioactive gravel that was used to shield the reactor were shipped to \rthe Department of Energy Savannah River Plant in South Carolina. [1] The \rremaining low-level contaminated soil was shipped to the Naval base at \rPort Hueneme, California. [1] The clean up operation lasted until 1979 \ras work on the site could be performed only during the austral summer. \r[7]\n    As a result of the multiple malfunctions of the PM-3A \ras well as it&#39;s clean up activities, there have been concerns that the \rhealth of personnel involved with the reactor may have been adversely \raffected. [7] Although members of the Navy Nuclear Propulsion Unit were \rcontinuously monitored for radiation, many of the military support crew \rwere not. [7] As such, a study was undertaken by the Department of \rDefense to estimate an upper bound on radiation exposure for these \rindividuals based on the worst cases of the available data from McMurdo. \r[7] Levels of radioactivity in the water were monitored once the PM-3A \rwas used in the production of drinking water. [7] During the first few \ryears of fresh water production (between 1967 and 1969) there were \rseveral instances of abnormally high amounts of tritium in the drinking \rwater. [7] In addition, there was a case of abnormally high amounts of \rlong-lived beta activity in the drinking water in 1969. [7]\n    In addition to problems with the drinking water and \renvironmental contamination, there were several recorded instances of \rcrew radiation exposure, some resulting in injury. [7] During the plant \roperation, 223 reports of abnormal levels of radiation were recorded. \r[7] Of these cases, 14 resulted in injury and 123 resulted in exposure \rin the amount of 0.350 rem over a period of 7 days. [7] This is a \rsubstantial amount of radiation when it is estimated that, one average, \ra typical yearly dose from background sources is 0.240 rem. [8] The \rremaining 86 instances were abnormal radiation levels detected within \rthe plant and its immediate surroundings. [7] The conclusion was that a \rsupport member would have received a maximum dose of 0.2 to 0.6 rem to \rthe thyroid or 0.2 to 0.5 rem to the red bone marrow per austral summer \rtour. [7] The upper bound here is equivalent a typical radiation dosage \rreceived by a person living in the United States from typical background \rradiation and medical procedures. [7] It is, however, recognized that \rthere were personnel who may have been exposed to radiation outside the \rconfines of factors and data considered in those figures that may be \religible for compensation. [7] In addition, the estimated dose above \rdoes not include members who were part of the decommissioning procedures \rwho may have inhaled or ingested contaminated particles. [7]\n    The nuclear reactor installed at McMurdo Station was \rthe first and only to operate on the Antarctic continent. It operated \rfor 10 years and greatly reduced the need for fossil fuels in the \rAntarctic. Although it was initially thought to be a cost saving device, \rits unreliability, large operational crew, and large clean up proved it \rto be an expensive experiment.
