Instead they accidentally sent  $893 million--the entire balance of the loan, which was not due until 2023.\n When they realized their mistake, they tried to get the money back. Some of the lenders refused, leaving Citigroup out of roughly $500 million. The case went to trial, and  this week U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan ruled against Citigroup.\n How could an error like this possibly happen? Terrible, terrible UI design, as it turns out. First off we need to understand the mechanisms of the repayment arrangement, which is executed through a piece of financial software called Flexcube. As Judge Furman summarized:\n  On Flexcube, the easiest (or perhaps only) way to execute the transaction\u2014to pay the Angelo Gordon Lenders their share of the principal and interim interest owed as of August 11, 2020, and then to reconstitute the 2016 Term Loan with the remaining Lenders\u2014was to enter it in the system as if paying off the loan in its entirety, thereby triggering accrued interest payments to all Lenders, but to direct the principal portion of the payment to a &#34;wash account&#34;\u2014&#34;an internal Citibank account... to help ensure that money does not leave the bank.&#34;\n Ars Technica got ahold of a screenshot used in the case, which shows where the screw-up occurred:\n The actual work of entering this transaction into Flexcube fell to a subcontractor in India. He was presented with a Flexcube screen that looked like this:\n   The subcontractor thought that checking the &#34;principal&#34; checkbox and entering the number of a Citibank wash account would ensure that the principal payment would stay at Citibank. He was wrong. To prevent payment of the principal, the subcontractor actually needed to set the &#34;front&#34; and &#34;fund&#34; fields to the wash account as well as &#34;principal.&#34; The subcontractor didn&#39;t do that.\n Citibank&#39;s procedures require that three people sign off on a transaction of this size. In this case, that was the subcontractor, a colleague of his in India, and a senior Citibank official in Delaware. All three believed that setting the &#34;principal&#34; field to an internal wash account number would prevent payment of the principal. As he approved the transaction, the Delaware supervisor wrote: &#34;looks good, please proceed. Principal is going to wash.&#34;\n  It looked &#34;good&#34; to the senior supervisor because there are no design provisions to make it look bad. You would think, where an error of this magnitude was possible, the software designers would group certain buttons together, provide warning prompts, change colors from green to red, or a combination of these things. Instead the program appears to have been designed by an engineer in the &#39;90s.\n The upshot for you UI designers out there: Banks will certainly be looking for better software in the future, and willing to pay top dollar for it. There&#39;s a real opportunity here.\n      They&#39;ll actually just continue paying as little as humanly possible for disposable offshore contractors because that&#39;s what American banks do.\n  What else should we sub out? ooh, Let&#39;s subcontract the management of our heart beating to a company in India while we&#39;re at it. And yes, what a horrible software UI, however, most industrial software interfaces look like1993 and run on terrifyingly open systems and on 10 plus-year-old Operating Systems.", "posttime":

", "note_en": "NEW YORK (Reuters) -PayPal Holdings Inc will lift merchant costs for its branded payment products while cutting those for behind-the-scenes processing of some Visa and Mastercard transactions, a bold move in an increasingly competitive digital payments sector.\n  The strategic shift reflects PayPal\u2019s growing power in online transactions, which surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. As consumers and businesses flocked to the company, a market leader, during lockdown, its active accounts mounted to 377 million, more than twice as many as in 2015.\n The company said the move reflected the value of its proprietary services, with consumers nearly three times as likely to complete a purchase when PayPal products are available at checkout, while users of the new buy-now-pay-later option spend an average of 15% more.\n \u201cWe are changing prices to help our customers understand even more clearly where we provide value,\u201d Dan Leberman, PayPal\u2019s senior vice president for small and medium business and partners, said in an interview.\n    PayPal will charge sellers 3.49% plus 49 cents to process transactions made through its proprietary products, including its button on merchant websites and its digital wallet, according to material the company shared with Reuters.\n The higher rate applies to products like PayPal Checkout, Pay with Venmo, PayPal Credit and new buy-now-pay-later offering Pay in 4.\n PayPal has 392 million active accounts, including 31 million merchants globally, and also owns Venmo, Braintree and iZettle.\n It will be hard for merchants to know how much extra value they are getting from PayPal features in exchange for the higher rates, said Ben Dwyer, the founder of cardfellow.com who analyzes processing deals offered to merchants.\n \u201cPayPal wants to be a comprehensive payment solution, but it is tough to get there by selling on value over price.\u201d\n  Sellers will pay 2.59% plus 49 cents for PayPal to process, unseen by consumers, online payments made with Visa and Mastercard debit and credit cards from other companies.\n In the past, PayPal charged sellers 2.9% plus 30 cents for payments on most online transactions, regardless of its role.\n Lowering basic transaction processing rates helps PayPal compete with rivals including Stripe and Authorize.net. PayPal expects to acquire customers because of the discounts, Leberman said.\n \u201cWe think it\u2019s a bold price to come out with,\u201d he said.\n As large merchants tend to negotiate unique deals, rate hikes will largely affect small-to-medium sized businesses, some of which have lost confidence this year due to a nationwide labor shortage and inflation worries.\n  The changes largely reflect services PayPal has developed since splitting from eBay Inc in 2015.\n Although most of its transactions are online, PayPal will also reduce prices for in-person transactions through its network, which should help it compete with Square Inc.\n For most of those purchases over $10, PayPal will charge 1.90% plus 10 cents. For cheaper buys, the rate will usually be 2.40% plus 5 cents.\n PayPal\u2019s business boomed during the pandemic as more homebound consumers spent online. It processed $285 billion in payments in the first quarter, up 49% from the year-earlier period.\n \u201cIt\u2019s more than just pricing,\u201d said Aaron Press, an analyst at research company IDC. \u201cThey are making sure the market understands that they should be thinking of PayPal as a comprehensive payments strategy and not just one form of payment.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-19

$[0, X] \\times [0, Y]$, to intensities such as (R, G, B). To store it on computer memory, an image is  discretized to an array  array[H][W], where each element  array[i][j] is a  pixel.\n How does discretization work? How does a discrete pixel relate to the abstract notion of the underlying continuous image? These basic questions play an important role in computer graphics &amp; computer vision algorithms.\n This article discusses these low level details, and how they affect our CNN models and deep learning libraries. If you ever wonder which resize function to use or whether you should add/subtract 0.5 or 1 to some pixel coordinates, you may find answers here. Interestingly, these details have contributed to many accuracy improvements in Detectron and Detectron2.\n   Sampling theory tells us how a continuous 2D signal is turned into a discrete array by  sampling and  filtering.\n We choose a $H \\times W$ rectangular grid of points, from which we will draw samples. In order to make best use of the produced samples, we have to know the exact location every sample on this grid is chosen.\n Values on these sampled points are not directly retrieved from the original signal, but come from a filtering step that removes high-frequency components. Bad choice of filter can lead to aliasing effects.\n Sampling and filtering are both important in basic image processing operations, such as resize. Resize operation takes a discrete image, resamples it and creates a new image. The choice of sampling grid and sampling filter will then affect how such a basic operation is implemented.\n For example, the paper  On Buggy Resizing Libraries and Surprising Subtleties in FID Calculation studies the filtering issues, and shows that the resize operations in many libraries (OpenCV, PyTorch, TensorFlow) don&#39;t take into account the low-pass filtering. This then leads to incorrect deep learning evaluation.\n In this article, we ignore the issue of sampling filter, and only studies the  coordinates of sampling grid. We&#39;ll see that this choice is also inconsistent among libraries, and can affect the design and performance of CNN models.\n  Pixels are located on a sampling grid we choose. Naturally, we would like to only consider rectangular grids where pixels are spaced evenly. But there are many other factors to concern with:\n  (These terminology may have a different meaning elsewhere, but this is how I define them in this article.)\n For simplicity, we look at the one dimensional case instead. We want to answer this question: for a 1D signal defined on $[0, N]$, what is the sampling grid with stride=1? There are a few different choices:\n  In this figure, the green bars represent the 1D signal of length $N$, and blue dots represent the locations where point samples are taken. On top of each sample we labeled their  coordinates, while on the bottom are their zero-based  pixel indices. More formally, given a stride (which equals to 1 here), the offset and resolution of the grid are defined by the following table (assume $ \\frac{N}{stride}$ is an integer):\n $$ \\begin{array}{|c|ccc|} \\text{grid} &amp; \\text{offset} &amp; \\text{resolution} \\\\\\hline \u2460 &amp; 0 &amp; \\frac{N}{stride}+1 \\\\ \u2461 &amp; \\frac{stride}{2} &amp; \\frac{N}{stride} \\\\ \u2462 &amp; 0 &amp; \\frac{N}{stride} \\\\ \\end{array} $$\n They (or at least the first two) are all  valid interpretations when we are given an array of pixels. The interpretation we choose affects how we implement operations and models, because they each have some unique weird properties. To understand them more, let&#39;s check how a 2x resize operation should be implemented under each interpretation.\n  A unique undesired property of \u2460 is that, stride is not the inverse of resolution. So a 2x resize is ambiguous: we have to be clear whether we want half of stride, or twice more pixels. The new grids after resize look like these:\n    You can easily verify that the 4 different resized grids still match the corresponding definition in our table above.\n For 2D case, the 2x resize in \u2460(twice more pixels) and \u2461 look liks this (image credit:  here):\n   Extrapolation: \u2461 and \u2462 both need extrapolation outside the border of the original grid to perform resize, but \u2460 only needs interpolation. Extrapolation is sometimes undesirable.\n Asymmetry: \u2462 is asymmetric, and it&#39;s probably a good reason to never use it. One consequence is that  resize(flip(x)) != flip(resize(x)). All others are symmetric.\n Information Loss: in \u2460(half of stride) and \u2462 , about half of the points on the new grid exist in the old grid. By not having to interpolate their values, we minimize the loss of information. However, in \u2460(twice more pixels) and \u2461, most or all of the new pixels need to be recomputed.\n For resize with other arbitrary scale factor, all versions have information loss. But 2x/0.5x resize are most common in deep learning.\n The DeepLab series of segmentation models are famous for using grid \u2460(half of stride) for all the 2x resize. See  here for words from its author. This matches the inconvenient image shapes they use, such as 321x513. I&#39;ve heard opinions that the benefits of &#34;no information loss&#34; and &#34;no extrapolation&#34; may let it outperform \u2461 in segmentation, but I have yet to see more evidence.\n  What do libraries use? Situation is a bit messy. I&#39;ll list what I know and looking forward to your help to add more. No guarantee they are all correct, since I didn&#39;t check the source code for all of them.\n  TFv1  method=BILINEAR/NEAREST, align_corners=False: \u2462 TFv1  method=BILINEAR/NEAREST, align_corners=True: \u2460 TFv2  method=BILINEAR/NEAREST: \u2461 (In TFv2,  align_corners option was removed)\n It seems the mess is unique in the deep learning world. How come? From what I can tell, the history looks like this:\n TensorFlow is the first place that introduces \u2462, in its initial open source. This was later considered as  a bug and fixed in v2 (to not break compatibility in v1).\n align_corners=True(\u2460)  appeared in TensorFlow 0.7 in 2016. I guess this was probably intended for DeepLab development and not for general use.\n This means TensorFlow never had a proper resize function (grid \u2461) until TFv2! During all these years, the uncommon version (\u2460) and the wrong version (\u2462) have propagated to people&#39;s models and other libraries.\n PyTorch&#39;s  interpolate comes originally from  upsample operation. Nearest upsample was buggy when it&#39;s first  added in LuaTorch in 2014. Bilinear upsample was first  added in LuaTorch in 2016 and used grid \u2460. Grid \u2461 was  added in 2018 to PyTorch under an  align_corners=False option, and became the default since then.\n Due to this mess, resize operator in ONNX has to support  5 versions of coordinate transform! Kudos to ONNX maintainers.\n  Many computer graphics textbooks and papers talk about this topic and choose \u2461, for example:\n &#34;What Are the Coordinates of a Pixel?&#34; from  Graphics Gems. Explained again in  Real-time Rendering.\n (Note that some of them uses \u2461 but defines the continuous signal in the range $[-\\frac{stride}{2}, N-\\frac{stride}{2}]$. We&#39;ll discuss more about this.)\n Given all the graphics literature, computer vision and deep learning libraries promoting grid \u2461, we  use \u2461 as the convention.\n  We pick \u2461 as the convention for grid locations, but this is not the end of the story! We now know the grid locations  relative to the beginning of the signal are 0.5, 1.5, $\\cdots$, but what are their  absolute coordinates? In other words, where is the origin (0, 0) ?\n This is just a choice of convention and has no substantial effect on any algorithms. Two of the graphics literature I listed above put the origin on the first pixel. This has a benefit that all pixel locations have integer coordinates, but then it&#39;s weird that the signal lies on $[-0.5, N-0.5]$ This convention is sometimes referred to as &#34;integer centers&#34;.\n Another convention, &#34;integer corners&#34;, or &#34;half-integer centers&#34;, puts the origin on the beginning of the signal, so the first pixel is centered at (0.5, 0.5).  We chose integer corners, and then will have the following relationship between continuous coordinates and discrete pixel indices:\n  The choice doesn&#39;t matter for resize because absolute coordinates are never involved. However, for functions that accept or return absolute coordinates, we should be aware of their convention. For example:\n cv2.findContours returns integer polygons represented by indices. So we always add 0.5 pixel to its results to obtain coordinates that match our convention.\n cv2.warpAffine uses a coordinate system shifted by 0.5. It is complained in  this issue. In fact most OpenCV functions use the &#34;integer center&#34; convention.\n pycocotools.mask.frPyObjects can render polygons as masks. It accepts polygons that match our convention. Same for  PIL.ImageDraw.polygon, but its results are 0.5 pixel &#34;fatter&#34; due to how its implemented. This has affected cityscapes annotations.\n If a dataset is annotated with coordinates, we also need to know its choice of coordinate system. This information is often not provided by dataset owner, so we make guesses. For example, in COCO it appears that polygon annotations match our convention, but keypoint annotations do not and should be incremented by 0.5.\n Now that we have a convention for the coordinate system, it&#39;s a good practice in computer vision systems to  always use coordinates rather than indices to represent geometries, such as boxes and polygons. This is because indices are integers, and can easily lose precision during geometric operations. Using indices for bounding boxes has caused some issues in Detectron.\n  Models in  Detectron /  Detectron2 all involve localization of objects in images, so the convention of pixels and coordinates matters a lot. Various improvements and bugfixes in the two libraries are related to pixels.\n  In detection models, bounding box regression typically predicts &#34;deltas&#34; between the ground truth (GT) box and a reference box (e.g. anchor). In training, GT box is encoded to deltas as training target. In inference, the predicted deltas are decoded to become output box.\n Boxes in Detectron often use integer indices, instead of coordinates. So the width of a box is given by $x_1 - x_0 + 1$ instead of $x_1 - x_0$. Its box transform code looked like this for a long time (showing only one dimension for brevity):\n ref_x0, ref_x1: int  # the reference box ref_w = ref_x1 - ref_x0 +  1 ref_center = ref_x0 +  0.5 * ref_w    def   (x0, x1):  # given reference box and gt box  w = x1 - x0 +  1  center = x0 +  0.5 * w  dx = (center - ref_center) / ref_w  # delta between centers  dw = log(w / ref_w)  # delta between widths   return dx, dw    def   (dx, dw):  # given reference box and deltas  center = dx * ref_w + ref_center  # undo the encoding  w = exp(dw) * ref_w  x0, x1 = center -  0.5 * w, center +  0.5 * w   return x0, x1\n As innocent as the code seems, the two functions are not inverse of each other:  decode(encode(x0, x1)) != (x0, x1).  x1 is incorrectly decoded: it should be  center + 0.5 * w - 1 instead.\n This bug appeared in the  py-faster-rcnn project around 2015, and is  still there today. It was carried into Detectron and negatively affected results in the Mask R-CNN paper. Then it&#39;s  fixed in late 2017 after I found it, and contributed to an improvement of 0.4~0.7 box AP. Detectron went open source in 2018 with this fix. In Detectron2, we adopt the rule to always use floating point coordinates for boxes, so the issue no longer exists.\n  How to horizontally flip a geometry? Although pixel indices should be flipped by $i \\leftarrow W - 1 - i$, we should follow the rule to always use coordinates, and coordinates should be flipped by $x \\leftarrow W - x$ under &#34;integer corner&#34; system.\n Detectron isn&#39;t so rigorous on this and it  uses $W - 1 - x$ for coordinates. IIRC, fixing the issue leads to ~0.5 mask AP improvement.\n   The  code to generate anchors in Detectron is quite long, because it tries to generate integer-valued anchor boxes. By adopting coordinates for all boxes in Detectron2, integer boxes are not needed. This simplifies all the logic to just  a few lines of code.\n This does not affect accuracy, because the exact values of anchors are not that important as long as the same is used in training &amp; testing.\n  The RoIAlign operation crops a region from an image and resize it to certain shape. It&#39;s easy to make mistakes because two images and two coordinate systems are involved. Let&#39;s derive how to perform RoIAlign.\n  Given an image and a region (the green box), we want to resample a K $\\times$ K output image that corresponds to the region. W.l.o.g. we assume the input image has stride=1. Since we know the resolution and the absolute length of output, the output stride derived from the definition of grid \u2461 is $(\\frac{x_1 - x_0}{K}, \\frac{y_1-y_0}{K})$. Because grid offset is 0.5$\\times$stride, the location of output pixel  [i,j] is $$(x_0 + (0.5 + j)\\frac{x_1 - x_0}{K}, y_0 + (0.5 + i)\\frac{y_1 - y_0}{K})$$ Let&#39;s call it $(X, Y)$. To compute resampled values at location $(X, Y)$, an easy way is to do bilinear interpolation with its 4 nearest pixels (this corresponds to RoIAlign with  sampling_ratio=1). We show the 4 neighboring input pixels of  output[0,0] in the figure. The  indices of 4 nearest pixels of $(X, Y)$ are obtained after subtracting 0.5 to align their coordinate system:\n $$ \\begin{array}{l} A = \\text{input}[\\text{floor}(Y-0.5), \\text{floor}(X-0.5)] \\\\ B = \\text{input}[\\text{floor}(Y-0.5), \\text{ceil}(X-0.5)] \\\\ C = \\text{input}[\\text{ceil}(Y-0.5), \\text{floor}(X-0.5)] \\\\ D = \\text{input}[\\text{ceil}(Y-0.5), \\text{ceil}(X-0.5)] \\\\ \\end{array} $$\n The original implementation of RoIAlign in Detectron doesn&#39;t subtract 0.5 in the end, so it&#39;s actually not very aligned. It turns out this detail does not affect accuracy of R-CNNs, because RoIAlign is applied on CNN features, and CNN is believed to be able to fit slightly misaligned features.\n However, we have new use cases of RoIAlign in other places, e.g. to crop mask head training targets from the ground truth mask, so I fixed it in the detectron2 / torchvision RoIAlign with an   aligned=True option. Its  unittest demonstrates how the old version is misaligned.\n Btw, once we figured out the coordinate transform formula, it&#39;s easy to implement RoIAlign using  F.grid_sample. I had done the exercise and found this 10%-50% slower.\n  Mask R-CNN is trained to predict masks of fixed resolution (e.g. 28x28) restrained inside given boxes (we call it  &#34;RoIMask&#34;). But in the end we often want to obtain full-image masks. A &#34;paste mask&#34; operation is needed to paste the small RoIMask into the given region in the image.\n  This operation is an inverse of RoIAlign, so it should be implemented similar to our derivation above. In Detectron, this  was implemented with some magic rounding &amp; resize that are not exactly the inverse of RoIAlign. Fixing it in detectron2 increases the mask AP by 0.1~0.4.\n  PointRend is a segmentation method we created that focuses on point-wise features.  Pointly-Supervised Instance Segmentation, also from our team, uses point-wise annotations to train segmentation models. Both projects involve heavy use of point sampling and coordinate transforms. Having a clear convention of pixels and coordinates was important to their success.\n  Due to some sloppy code in the early days of deep learning libraries, today we&#39;re facing multiple versions of resize functions. Together with the two different coordinate system conventions, they easily cause hidden bugs in computer vision code.\n This article revisits these historical technical debts and shows how these fun details matter in modeling and training. I hope they will help you make proper choices.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 11:13:09", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60,\u5b66\u4e60,learning", "title": "\u50cf\u7d20\u5728\u54ea\u91cc\uff1f - \u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89c2\u70b9 ", "title_en": "Where Are Pixels? \u2013 A Deep Learning Perspective", "transed": 1, "url": "https://ppwwyyxx.com/blog/2021/Where-are-Pixels/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60", "\u5b66\u4e60", "learning"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "3640c0c414cf4d9e24779712c44d9853.png", "infoid": 1066825, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u9047\u5230\u4e86Jambi The Pee-Wee\u7684\u5267\u573a\u7684Genie\uff0c\u5728\u5373\u5174\u559c\u5267\u9662\u7684\u5730\u4e0b\u5ba4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u751f\u6daf\u90fd\u5f00\u59cb\u4e86\u3002\u4ed6\u662f\u72e1\u733e\u548c\u90aa\u6076\u7684\u7b11\u5bb9\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7acb\u523b\u6210\u4e3a\u6700\u597d\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u3002\u5728\u4e00\u7fa4\u7279\u522b\u6709\u624d\u534e\u548c\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u4eba\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ed6\u9677\u5165\u4e86\u56f0\u5883\u3002\u7ad9\u51fa\u6765\u3002\n \u4ed6\u5bf9\u6211\u7684\u6210\u529f\u9020\u6210\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u591a\u5341\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e00\u8d77\u6f14\u51fa\uff0c\u4e00\u8d77\u5199\u9053\u5e76\u4e00\u8d77\u6302\u51fa\u6765\u3002\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u5f7c\u6b64\u7684\u611f\u60c5\u4e2d\uff08\u4ee5\u53ca\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff09\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e92\u76f8\u641e\u7b11\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u611f\u5230\u795e\u5947\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6709\u65f6\u4f1a\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u6211\u4eec\u521b\u9020\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\n \u5f53\u6492\u5c3f\u8d6b\u5c14\u66fc\u79c0\u51fa\u751f\u65f6\uff0c\u7ea6\u7ff0\u5bf9\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u9b54\u6cd5\u7684\u7cbe\u7075\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u60f3\u6cd5\u3002\u4e00\u5929\u540e\uff0c\u5f53\u6211\u73af\u4fdd\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u548c\u6211\u6b63\u5728\u6cbf\u7740\u597d\u83b1\u575e\u5927\u9053\u5f00\u8f66\uff0c\u770b\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u53eb'jambi'\u7684\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\u5e97\u7684\u6807\u5fd7\u3002\n \u4ece\u6211\u4eec\u90fd\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6211\u7684\u6210\u529f\u548c\u540d\u58f0\u4f5c\u4e3aPee-Wee Herman\uff0c\u7ea6\u7ff0\u662f\u6211\u6700\u4eb2\u5bc6\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u3002\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6240\u6709\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e74\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u7684\u4e50\u8da3\uff0c\u4e00\u8d77\u5632\u7b11\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u9a74\u5b50\u3002\u6211\u771f\u7684\u5f88\u7231\u4ed6\u3002 ", "note_en": "I met John Paragon, Jambi the genie on  Pee-wee\u2019s Playhouse, at the improvisational comedy group The Groundlings, where both our careers started.

Some of them are troubling, such as the conspiratorial prejudice that has fuelled QAnon and the recent surge in violence against those of Asian descent. Others are restorative: the immersive worlds of books, the virtual realities of video games, the hypnotic lull of binge-streamed television series.\n Many of the escapes that we use to nourish ourselves originated in Japan. The stunning success of Nintendo\u2019s Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which sold thirty-one million copies worldwide last year, is a striking example. Now we have another, in the form of an imported anime with a mouthful of a title: \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba the Movie: Mugen Train.\u201d It d\u00e9buted in Japanese theatres in October of 2020, then arrived in American ones in April. It quickly set records for the highest-grossing opening weekend for a foreign film, as well as the highest-earning R-rated animated film. All of this has conspired to make it the planet\u2019s single  top-grossing film of 2020.\n This success might seem surprising, as anime has long been considered a fringe subculture, but the film\u2019s momentum was presaged by the enthusiasm of its reception in Japan. When \u201cMugen Train\u201d opened there, pandemic-weary audiences flocked to see it in theatres outfitted with socially distanced seating. By the end of the year, the film had emerged as more than simply a coronavirus phenomenon. It had done the unthinkable, unseating Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s 2001 epic, \u201cSpirited Away,\u201d to become the highest-grossing film in Japanese history. What Miyazaki\u2019s beloved film had earned over the course of nineteen years, \u201cMugen Train\u201d surpassed in just three months.\n It\u2019s tempting to frame the success of \u201cMugen Train\u201d as a passing of the torch from an elderly master to a younger generation\u2014and, indeed, Miyazaki has said that he considers the film a \u201c rival.\u201d (Miyazaki, who has announced his retirement numerous times over the decades, is currently working on what is purported to be his final film, titled \u201cHow Do You Live?\u201d) But \u201cMugen Train\u201d is the product of a very different creative process, and a very different media environment. Miyazaki\u2019s films are meditative, self-contained stories, created and financed independently, outside of the traditional corporate production committees that sustain Japan\u2019s commercial animation industry. He is an auteur who wears his politics on his sleeve, pens his own scripts, insists on checking nearly every frame himself, and long resisted merchandising his creations. In contrast, the hyperkinetic \u201cMugen Train\u201d is the latest installment in a series envisioned as a mass-market multimedia product from the very start. Tellingly, the vast majority of media coverage has focussed on its box-office success instead of its director, Haruo Sotozaki, or its writers, who aren\u2019t credited individually but under the name of the film\u2019s production company, Ufotable.\n  \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba the Movie: Mugen Train\u201d is the continuation of a hit television series called \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,\u201d which was, in turn, based upon a hit manga of the same title, by the artist Koyoharu Gotoge. The series is set in Japan\u2019s Taisho era, which lasted from 1912 to 1926; the precise date is never specified. The hero is Tanjiro Kamado, a boy who ekes out a living with his mother and siblings in the verdant mountains of a rapidly modernizing Japan. One day, Tanjiro returns from an errand to discover that his family has been slaughtered by demons: vicious monsters that roam the land in search of human blood. For these malevolent creatures, humans are both sustenance and a medium of reproduction, for once bitten, a human will inevitably turn demon. A blend of Western vampire lore and local Japanese folk traditions, the demons are dark mirrors of the human condition, their appearances varying wildly depending on whatever negative traits they possessed as humans. The lone survivor of this massacre is Tanjiro\u2019s sister Nezuko, who now teeters on the cusp of turning into a demon herself. Before Tanjiro can react, a mysterious warrior appears and tries to kill Nezuko; Tanjiro instinctively protects her. During the battle, it becomes clear that Nezuko has retained her human personality and is actively resisting her thirst for blood. The stranger fits Nezuko with a bamboo gag\u2014better safe than sorry\u2014then instructs Tanjiro to seek out a secret society called the Demon Slayer Corps. So it is that the siblings are thrust into a shadow war playing out between humanity and demon-kind.\n None of this context is explained in the film; instead, the backstory plays out across twenty-six blood-drenched television episodes, more than ten hours in total, available to stream on Netflix, Crunchyroll, and other platforms. \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba the Movie: Mugen Train\u201d picks up precisely where the series leaves off. There is no recap, and nothing in the way of exposition. Theatregoers are presumed to have their tickets, so to speak, for the train ride on which most of the film\u2019s action unfolds. (\u201cIt\u2019s almost impressive how fast \u2018Mugen Train\u2019 is able to completely disorient anyone who doesn\u2019t already know where it\u2019s going,\u201d IndieWire  wrote.)\n  Expecting such familiarity with a large amount of source material would seem an obstacle to mainstream success, but \u201cMugen Train\u201d had some help. Trapped indoors by  -19 restrictions, a lot of us turned to streaming platforms for solace, and a great many of the shows that we watched were anime. Netflix reported a fifty-per-cent increase in viewership of the genre compared to the year before.\n  \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba\u201d d\u00e9buted as a print manga, in February, 2016, in the pages of a magazine called  Weekly Shonen Jump. Launched in 1968,  Jump is one of Japan\u2019s oldest and most successful manga weeklies; at its peak, in the nineties, it sold more than six million copies every week. Key to the publication\u2019s enduring popularity is a calculated approach to cultivating talent, honed over the decades by an editorial department that carefully directs the output of freelance comic creators. Every issue of  Jump contains a postcard asking readers to rank their favorite titles; this data is then used to shape the direction of story lines in real time. The  Jump formula has produced some of Japan\u2019s most enduring pop-cultural hits, including \u201cDragon Ball,\u201d \u201cNaruto,\u201d \u201cOne Piece,\u201d and \u201cMy Hero Academia.\u201d It could be argued that, by teasing out episodes of manga via the \u201calgorithm\u201d of reader feedback, and then compiling the most popular series into separately sold stand-alone volumes that could be \u201cbinged\u201d all at once,  Jump presaged the way the world consumes streaming entertainment today.\n  From an artist\u2019s perspective, working for  Jump is something like a comic-book boot camp. In a story now enshrined in manga-industry lore, an editor at the magazine compelled the manga artist Akira Toriyama to submit five hundred pages of concepts before finally accepting the one that became his d\u00e9but, the scatological sci-fi comedy \u201c Dr. Slump.\u201d Artists, even established ones, submit to such gruelling oversight because the stakes are enormous. Afterward, Toriyama went on to make \u201c Dragon Ball,\u201d a martial-arts epic inspired in turns from Jackie Chan movies and the Ming-era Chinese epic \u201cJourney to the West.\u201d It went on to sell two hundred and sixty million copies worldwide. Six out of the ten best-selling manga series of all time originated in the  Jump offices. Landing a sustained hit in the weekly magazine virtually guarantees that the comic will be animated, merchandised, and transformed into a lucrative global franchise. This makes  Weekly Shonen Jump more than a publication: it is a dream factory for creators and consumers both.\n  The word  shonen means \u201cboy,\u201d but  shonen manga, as boys\u2019 comics are called in Japan, are widely read by both boys and girls. In spite of this mixed readership, however,  Weekly Shonen Jump has never employed a  female editor in its more than fifty years of operation. Part of the boys\u2019-club atmosphere is tradition. But, in this day and age, it\u2019s easy to question whether institutional sexism might play a role. When, in 2019, the  HuffPost officially queried whether a woman might ever be named an editor at the magazine,  Jump\u2019s publisher, Shueisha, responded that, while it wouldn\u2019t be without precedent, \u201cit\u2019s important to understand the hearts of boys,\u201d a sort of circular-logic non-response. Other hints can be found in the pages of the weekly itself. \u201cBakuman,\u201d a 2008 series chronicling the efforts of two high-school boys to make their professional artistic d\u00e9but in  Jump, describes the protagonists\u2019 ambitions as \u201cdreams that women will never be able to understand.\u201d It\u2019s puzzling to encounter such a contemptuous sentiment in the pages of the magazine\u2014particularly when you consider how many of Japan\u2019s most successful cartoon franchises, including \u201cFullmetal Alchemist\u201d and \u201cSailor Moon,\u201d are the handiwork of female creators. And more than a few popular series by women, such as Katsura Hoshino\u2019s \u201cD. Gray-man,\u201d have even been published in  Jump.\n Part of the mainstream success of \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba\u201d may in fact lay in its refreshing lack of gender stereotypes. In spite of the fact that co-star Nezuko spends the majority of the series muzzled with a piece of bamboo, she is no silent damsel in distress; as often as not she comes to Tanjiro&#39;s rescue in battle. Nor are the demons faceless fiends to be casually vanquished, \u00e0 la the shambling zombies of so many Western horror series: some are virtually indistinguishable from normal humans, while others are revealed to have tragic backstories that cast their motivations in a sympathetic light. The series\u2019 reclusive creator, who goes by the gender-neutral pen name Koyoharu Gotoge, has never revealed their identity, but the news magazine  Shukan Bunshun quotes an unidentified  Jump employee who describes the author as a thirtysomething female. If true, this would mean that the single most popular boys\u2019 manga series in history was actually created by a woman.\n \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d represents many transitions: between generations of artists, of course, but also from financially unpredictable auteurism to focus-tested corporate formulas better suited to the streaming era\u2014and, perhaps, from a male-dominated to a more inclusive way of crafting anime. So, too, does the movie herald a shift in the way that the planet dreams. Part of the success of \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba the Movie: Mugen Train\u201d is attributable to an unprecedented global situation that focussed the attention of so many millions on to the series via streaming platforms. But America is finally beginning to open up again, and \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d\u00a0\u2019s popularity shows no sign of flagging. Nor does the popularity of manga as a medium, the sales of which in America are significantly outstripping traditional American superhero fare. The film\u2019s reception seems to suggest that anime is finally poised to make its leap from the shadows of subculture into the mainstream. Streaming platforms have been quick to grasp the import. In December, Sony paid more than a billion dollars to acquire Netflix\u2019s biggest rival in streaming anime, Crunchyroll; Netflix, in turn, announced that it plans to fund and premi\u00e8re forty new anime series in 2021.\n In 1990, Joseph Nye, a Harvard professor of political science, first proposed a corollary to a nation\u2019s \u201chard power,\u201d its military forces or economic resources: \u201csoft power.\u201d He defined it in terms of \u201cwhen one country gets other countries to want what it wants.\u201d Most of his case studies focussed on the global proliferation of Western mores, ranging from democracy to rock and roll, but he also stressed that the currents of globalization flow both ways. \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d proves the point: when it comes to anime, at least, Japan has persuaded the world to want what it wants.\n    Sign up for our daily  newsletter to receive the best stories from  The New Yorker.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 11:12:15",

\n...... ", "note_en": "E ven before Seb had arrived at the prison, five weeks before my first visit, the staff had received a notification that he ought to be subject to close monitoring. While still in police custody, an out-of-hours forensic psychiatric assessment had been requested.\n Seb had been compliant with the arresting officers, but he had given the impression that he was unconcerned by what had happened \u2013 it seemed as though he didn\u2019t mind at all that he was being arrested. More bizarrely, there were flickers of apparent self-satisfaction. Seb had been arrested on suspicion of murdering his mother.\n  A nurse and the on-call doctor from the local forensic unit travelled to the police station, but Seb declined to come out of the cell to speak to them. Accompanied by police officers, the clinicians went to his cell to speak to him directly, but whatever they said, Seb stuck to the same line: he had nothing to say to them. He even resisted attempts to be drawn into casual conversation. The clinicians, along with the on-call consultant, agreed that Seb did not require admission to hospital. Having said that, this reticence, along with the particulars of the crime Seb had committed, left the assessors reluctant to rule out psychiatric issues completely.\n The next morning the doctor who had assessed Seb in the police station called the prison mental health team to recommend that, on arrival, he should be admitted to the healthcare wing for further monitoring. From their observations, the officers and nurses also felt that Seb was not quite right, though they found it difficult to put their finger on precisely why they felt that way. He kept a distance from everyone. When he spoke, he used as few words as possible to make his point, which was either a specific request \u2013 such as for clean towels \u2013 or more often to decline offers of help or support from the staff.\n He did not want to come out of the cell for meals or to relax in the day room. He seemed to be eating and sleeping well, and although he avoided contact, if they spoke to him he was not noticeably irritable and there had not been any aggression. That was, until the second night.\n  Just before the end of her long shift, one of the nurses went to check on Seb. She found him leaning on his sink looking into the small wall-mounted mirror. At first glance there was nothing unusual. During the debrief later, the nurse recalled that it was slightly odd that he did not react at all to her presence, but at the time she thought there was a mundane explanation; he seemed lost in his own thoughts.\n With only one foot in his cell, the nurse tried to get Seb\u2019s attention by calling his name. Then it was a bit of a blur. He must have sprung towards her and, as she made to leave the cell, wrapped his forearm around her neck, pulling her back. The staff heard her shout out, and the sound of her alarm, which she had activated by pressing the red button on her belt radio.\n Fortunately, it was only a few steps from the nurses\u2019 office to Seb\u2019s cell, but they were not expecting the strength with which Seb fought against their attempts to release his arm from their colleague\u2019s neck. A prison officer who arrived at the scene admitted that he felt he had no choice but to hit Seb on the head. With the help of officers who had run from other wings in response to the alarm, they were able to free the nurse and lock Seb back in his cell.\n After what was regarded as an attempted hostage-taking incident on the healthcare wing, Seb was assessed as too dangerous to remain there, and so when I visited him, I made my way to the segregation unit.\n  I  specialise in forensic psychiatry, a branch of medicine that deals with the assessment and treatment of offenders in prisons and secure hospitals, many of whom exhibit violent behaviour. I had been asked by Seb\u2019s legal team to offer an expert opinion on his mental state at the time of the offence. (To maintain patient confidentiality, Seb is not his real name and other identifiers have been altered.)\n As a regular visitor,  I knew the atmosphere on the unit was completely unpredictable; it could at times be eerily quiet, but frequently I had arrived in the \u201cseg\u201d to a cacophony of screams, shouts, howls and shuddering bangs that were made all the more unnerving by the sources of the noise being out of sight. The only opportunity for the residents of the bleak, single-occupancy cells to interact face to face with their fellow inmates was during their brief allotted time for exercise in individual caged pods running outside half the length of the building.\n Otherwise, communication was mostly done by shouting indiscriminately across the central space of the unit. Sometimes these were calls to welcome a new arrival who was in their fold, or to threaten ones who were not. Alternatively, the focus of their attention could be the officers; either to plead for something, or announce their aggressive intentions.\n Visitors to the unit often provoked renewed excitement. I used to wonder how the prisoners who already knew me could tell when I came on the wing, despite the doors and hatches being firmly shut. They\u2019d yell, \u201cDr Nathan, come here a minute, I need to speak to you,\u201d just after I passed their door. I realised later that they could spy through the narrow slit between the heavy metal door and its frame. When other prisoners heard about the presence of a doctor, they would shout out that they were ill and needed to see me urgently. Some probably required medical attention. Most were suffering from extreme isolation and craved any sort of interaction. The calls tended to subside once I had passed along the unit, or they would turn into other pleas and threats, as if the existence of other people also reminded them of their desires and grievances.\n  Seb was on what the officers call a \u201cthree-officer unlock\u201d. All segregation unit residents are only allowed out of their cells one at a time, but those who are considered particularly unpredictable, like Seb, require at least three officers to be on hand before the door to the cell can be opened.\n But when we got to his cell, Seb had covered himself entirely with his blanket and remained still. When the officer opened the door and announced why we were there, there was no sign of a response. Feeling self-conscious about talking to a blanket in front of an audience of three officers and a trainee doctor, I introduced myself to Seb and said that I was there to see if there was anything else that could be done to help.\n In the silence waiting for a response, I scanned his cell for anything of significance. During assessments of prisoners in the segregation unit, I have often found their cells to be in a state of disarray. The floor may be sodden after the occupant has blocked their lavatory as an act of dissent. Messages may be scrawled on fragments of paper or other surfaces. On occasion, faeces have been smeared on the walls in what is called a \u201cdirty protest\u201d. There were no such signs in Seb\u2019s cell. The very few possessions were arranged tidily on the floor against the furthest wall.\n As a last attempt to get his attention, the lead officer told Seb that soon there would not be another chance to speak to a doctor. It had no effect. Seb remained silent. Maintaining the direction of my gaze towards Seb, I carefully stepped backward out of the cell.\n My role in visiting prisoners like Seb is to help his legal team establish a picture of the defendant\u2019s mind so they can decide what plea he should enter. When I began practising forensic psychiatry 23 years ago, I quickly learned that anticipating questions that lawyers would ask required me to start thinking more deeply about the patient\u2019s mind than my psychiatric training had prepared me for. The court may be willing to take account of my evidence about the role of an unfortunate upbringing, or birth trauma on the actions of the defendant, but they would also need to hear how those particular factors are relevant \u2013 why their mental processes led them to commit this particular crime.\n Once I extended my practice beyond working on criminal trials and began appearing as an expert witness in family courts and in other types of legal proceedings, the limitations of an explanation based on a diagnosis or a list of causal factors became clear. It would be of little assistance to the family courts in deciding about the safe care of a child if I were to just present symptom names and the associated diagnostic label. From my assessment, I need to acquire an understanding of that person\u2019s subjective experience \u2013 their thoughts, feelings, emotions, perceptions \u2013 so that I can try to explain not only why they had behaved as they had, but also the circumstances that may increase the chances they would behave in that way again.\n  S eb\u2019s solicitor had requested an opinion on whether his client\u2019s mental state at the time of the offence amounted to insanity. The day after my unsuccessful assessment, I called his solicitor to let him know that Seb had refused to speak to me. Although the recent dramatic transformation of his personality with the development of eccentric behaviour, uncharacteristic violence and brooding reserve pointed to a \u201cdisease of the mind\u201d, until I could communicate with him, I was unable to determine whether that had caused him to not know what he was doing when he attacked his mother.\n Seb was not completely mute, but there was good reason to doubt his ability to make a proper defence to the charge of murder. My impression was that he was not being deliberately obstructive. I needed to come to a view on whether he could properly engage in the criminal proceedings; in other words, was he fit to plead? The final decision rests with the judge, having considered the evidence of two doctors. I filed my report to the solicitors stating that he was, in my opinion, unfit to plead.\n Until Seb agreed to speak, I was not going to be able to understand his mind. All the same, I was not content for him to stay in prison. There was enough evidence to make a case for assessment and treatment in hospital. Following liaison with a suitably secure forensic hospital and written recommendations to the Ministry of Justice, a warrant was issued for transfer.\n By the time we next met, six weeks later, Seb had been moved to a forensic hospital. I was reintroduced to him by a ward nurse who escorted him to the interview room. Before even having a chance to check whether he was any more communicative, I could see a change in his appearance. Many, but not necessarily all, of my patients who experience distressing psychotic experiences seem to gain significant benefit from antipsychotic medication, although unfortunately these often have side effects including weight gain. From Seb\u2019s heavier appearance, I suspected that he had been started on anti-psychotic medication.\n He told me that several months before his arrest he had started to feel overcome with waves of unease, which developed into a more relentless sense of foreboding and dread. Things around him didn\u2019t feel right. People had a dreamlike aura about them. He questioned whether they were who he thought they were. Then Seb\u2019s thoughts crystallised. It dawned on him that he was surrounded by imposters. The woman masquerading as his mother looked and behaved like her in every respect, but he could not shake his conviction that she was a charlatan, and that this imposter was involved in the abduction of his real mother. The usurper, who had cleverly adopted all his mother\u2019s characteristics, vehemently repudiated his allegations.\n He explained to me that he interpreted her protestations as a sign of how desperate she was to maintain the fraud. His tone became more earnest as he spoke about the offence, but he did not become overtly emotional. (It was as if his memory was not yet fully infused with emotion \u2013 whereas his words acknowledged responsibility for carrying out the offence, his tone was that of an objective spectator.) Seb had felt that his options were narrowing. He could not leave the charade unchallenged, but revealing to the imposter that he knew the truth could imperil his true mother. He wrestled with himself before the night when he finally stabbed the woman he believed was not his mother while she slept.\n Seb took the failure of his real mother to reappear to be a sign that the conspiracy ran deeper than he had previously thought. He decided that the best course of action was to avoid talking to anyone about what he knew. On the whole, he could suppress signs of his simmering frustration, but occasionally it became too much to bear \u2013 such as after the first couple of days on the healthcare wing, when he grabbed the nurse.\n The way Seb spoke to me showed that he was able to stand back from his former conspiracy-obsessed existence and question the veracity of his beliefs. I asked him when his perspective changed. He said he had acquired his new insights several weeks after his admission, around the same time that he started taking antipsychotic medication.\n  There was agreement about Seb\u2019s diagnosis. The presence of delusions in the absence of other psychotic symptoms such as voices or visions encouraged a diagnosis of delusional disorder, which falls within the same category as schizophrenia. There was also a term for the specific type of experience he had: Capgras syndrome, named after Joseph Capgras, who described the case of a middle-aged woman from Paris who, in June 1918, visited the local police commissioner to ask for two officers to accompany her and witness the evidence of a widespread crime. She reported that children were being illegally confined across Paris, including in the basement of her house. The police took her to an infirmary, from where she was admitted to Sainte-Anne mental asylum.\n After about a year, she was transferred to another asylum, Maison Blanche. There she came to the attention of Capgras, a psychiatrist who was interested in the themes of substitutions and disappearances that ran through her delusional beliefs. She believed she had been the victim of an abduction, and that she and others had identical doubles. She thought that \u201cthe theatre played out by these doubles is unbelievable\u201d. With a colleague, the psychiatrist published a report on this case, which they termed  illusion des sosies, or illusion of doubles.\n My medical training had taught me that, having found a term for a patient\u2019s condition and one for his symptoms, I had achieved sufficient understanding and the assessment was complete. But these terms only describe, they do not explain.\n To get to the underlying mechanisms that explain why Seb was experiencing symptoms, we needed to listen in detail to exactly what he was saying.\n  K nowing a little about the workings of the brain could help us interpret Seb\u2019s words. Seb claimed that the woman he killed appeared to have the same form as his mother, but a different identity. He acknowledged that he could not detect any difference in appearance between the imposter and his mother, but even so, he was sure this was not his mother.\n We know from brain scans on both humans and other primates that recognising other people relies heavily on facial images, and involves a number of different brain pathways. Disruption in this neural network can interfere with a person\u2019s ability to recognise the face of a familiar person, a condition that is known as prosopagnosia, literally meaning \u201cface ignorance\u201d.\n Seb\u2019s problem was not prosopagnosia. He could recognise the form of his mother\u2019s face. It was her identity that he questioned. Before the definable paranoid beliefs took hold, his perception of the world was accompanied by a general sense of doubt. He emphasised feelings of unreality; he was sure of nothing. Seb could not grasp a clear meaning, but there was an undertone of danger.\n Seb spoke of a jump from this early feeling of ambiguity and nebulous threat to the arrival of certainty. An idea came to him that helped resolve his confusion about the reality of the world around him (including his mother\u2019s identity) and to him it was consistent with his conspiratorial feelings. But while this idea \u2013 that his mother had been replaced by an imposter \u2013 matched his reality, it was out of kilter with everyone else\u2019s. And so, instead of rejecting the idea, Seb interpreted others\u2019 actions in a way that supported this idea. The belief that his mother\u2019s replacement was part of a wider plot gave meaning to his experiences and he selected evidence consistent with that meaning. In reaction to a loss of the sense of familiarity that had previously accompanied the visual image of his mother, Seb accepted a coherent yet false narrative.\n Neurobiological studies have improved our understanding of the origins of psychotic distortions of the sort experienced by Seb. But using only the language of brain chemicals and neuronal pathways is not sufficient. We have to retain the subjective perspective to truly understand human experience and behaviour. To explain violence, we must contextualise the physiology with psychological abstractions, such as impulses, urges and motives.\n  T he narrative that Seb had created was obviously a delusional one, but sometimes the basis of a narrative that supports a violent act is more difficult to judge. Most patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia are not violent. By chronicling forensic psychiatric cases, there is a risk of reinforcing the media cliche of the violent schizophrenic.\n On the contrary, my view is that such stereotypes are broken down by sympathetically examining real-life cases while emphasising their rarity. The diagnosis of schizophrenia relies in part on the identification of psychotic experiences such as delusional beliefs or hallucinatory voices. It comes as a surprise to many that these experiences are not uncommon among the general population.\n A clinical diagnosis requires the unusual experiences to be accompanied by high levels of distress and dysfunction. Some individuals suffering in this way may have periods when, to the observer, their behaviour appears bizarre. What has become increasingly clear to me in my practice is that diagnosis is not a particularly informative way of understanding behaviour. I have been involved in too many trials in which the central issue has been whether the criteria for a specific diagnosis were met.\n At the core of most motives for violence are assumptions about the intentions of others. Seb believed that a sinister collective was intent on keeping his mother hidden against her will.\n Understanding motivation is certainly important, but we also need to think about why hostile feelings are so seldom translated into homicidal actions. For most of us, even a flickering awareness of the consequences of our imagined aggression triggers negative feelings that prevent us from going through with a violent act. And since we are programmed to avoid negative feelings, we are inclined to suppress or resist the thoughts that cause them. If you were to imagine being the perpetrator of a violent attack on the person you love or care for most in the world, it is likely that you are immediately repulsed by the thought \u2013 that you imagine the horror in their reaction, the pain they would feel, the feelings of shock, betrayal, confusion. Thus adopting the emotional perspective of the victim is, for most people, enough to stop a violent impulse in its tracks. When we imagine a violent act from the perspective of the victim, we are demonstrating a type of empathy \u2013 we are imagining the mind of another.\n Empathy is a critical human ability and, when it comes to violence, it is powerfully inhibiting. So crucial are these processes that they do not even require conscious effort: they run behind the scenes, constantly inhibiting myriad counterproductive impulses.

"note_en": "We\u2019ve all heard this riddle: if you dig down deep enough in Windows 10, you\u2019ll find elements that date from Windows 3.x days. But is it actually true? In this article we\u2019ll discover just how many UI layers are in Windows and when they were first introduced.\n For the purpose of this experiment, I chose the latest Windows 10 Insider Build (as of February 6th, 2021), which is Windows 10 build 21301.\n   First, we begin with the latest and greatest, Fluent Design. Announced in 2017 and introduced with Windows 10 1803 update, Fluent Design is a major redesign of the Modern Design Language 2 (MDL2), aimed at bringing elements like Light, Depth, Motion, Material, and Scale. It also introduces the Reveal effects and the Acrylic translucent background.\n As of now, most of the inbox (UWP) applications have been upgraded to take use of Fluent elements, as well as some of the more front-facing elements, like the Start Menu, Activity Center and the Login Screen.\n Although Fluent Design was well appreciated, most of the enthusiasts considered this move too little, too late, as only a small subset of features have been enhanced with this new design style.\n   Just as we dig a bit deeper into the OS, we can see elements that haven\u2019t been upgraded since Windows 8/8.1.\n Some of these are glaring omissions, like the volume flyout, the USB flyout as well as some elements from the login screen.\n  Other Metro elements, although not as prominent, are the boot screen (which will soon be replaced with a newer one) and WinRE\n   Did you know: the first time the spinning dots were introduced was in Windows 8 build 7989.\n  Just like Windows 10, Windows 8 was also plagued with inconsistency issues (for better or for worse). However, Windows 8 added meaningful enhancements to major user elements, like the Windows Explorer or Task Manager. Although they would receive some quality-of-life improvements in subsequent Windows 10 updates, changes would be minimal.\n Also, an important change brought by Windows 8 was the redesign of the File Transfer dialogs.\n  Some of these changes started in Windows 7, which brings us to the fourth layer:\n  Windows 7 is without doubt one of the most beloved versions of Windows of all time, praised for its great enhancements over Windows Vista. It brought many new features that, although weren\u2019t as significant as those that Vista introduces, made Windows 7 a very solid OS, and a true successor to Windows XP. However, one of the most infamous changes brought with Windows 7 is the Ribbon UI, which is a feature ported from Office 2007. Some of the apps that got updated with the new Ribbon UI are Paint and Wordpad.\n Although at some point Microsoft decided to deprecate the classic Paint in favor of the new Paint 3D (introduced with Windows 10 Creators Update), after major backlash, they reversed their decision.\n  Other features that were updated in Windows 7 and remained the same ever since are: Windows Media Player 12, Remote Desktop Connection and some file dialogs.\n   Windows Vista was a monumental Windows release, one that brought much needed modernization to the platform. Almost all of the fundamentals of the OS have been in some way or another improved, from the bootloader to the driver model. However, as we all know by now, Windows Vista would come to be one of the worst Windows releases ever, plagued with issues from the beginning. One of the few features that were praised, though, was the UI. It redesigned some of the fundamentals that haven\u2019t been updated since Windows 95. One of the main promotors of this change was the introduction of the so-called Aero Wizards, replaced the previous wizard standard, Wizard97.\n  Other features that were redesigned in Windows Vista and are basically the same in Windows 10: the Control Panel, the Search program, Windows Fax and Scan.\n  Speaking of Windows Vista: did you know that in certain special circumstances Windows 10 falls back to the Vista boot screen? It happens when your video card doesn\u2019t support the video mode that the standard boot screen uses.\n  Believe it or not, there are not that many XP elements embedded into Windows 10. That\u2019s probably because most of the fundamentals were updated already into Windows 2000. However, Windows 10 contains some file dialogs from XP, which are seen when one is installing a driver.\n   Windows 2000 was a big milestone for the NT lineup of operating systems from Microsoft. It also was the stepping stone that would signal the start the transition to a new, unified Windows vision. However, Windows 2000 was still a business-oriented OS, which means that it brought a lot of new features designed for experts.\n One of the most significant addition is the Management Console (MMC), whose UI elements are basically the same ever since.\n  Another feature introduced by default in Windows 2000 is Windows Installer, which still has the same icon from when it was first introduced!\n  Another UI element that hasn\u2019t changed (apart from branding, of course) is winver, whose design was introduced in Windows 2000 build 1946.\n  While Windows 2000 introduced lots of features aimed for power users, Windows 95 is probably the most significant Windows release to date. It introduced fundamental paradigms that still hold to this day. It introduced features like the Start Menu, context menus, the taskbar and recycle bin. While these features were of course updated over the course of many years, some remained almost exactly the same.\n  An element that is basically a relic of the older computing habits, where one had to protect their precious CRT screen is the screensaver settings.\n    One more common UI element that passed the test of time is the folder properties screen.\n  And there are so many more UI elements that haven\u2019t been touched since Windows 95. Is this a case of timeless design? I\u2019ll let you judge for yourself.\n  Well, this is not really a \u201cUI layer\u201d, as I haven\u2019t been able to find any interface elements predating Windows 95 (although I have a feeling that there certainly are). However, there is a peculiar file in Windows 10, called moricons.dll, which contains a lot of old icons from the DOS days. Take a look:\n  Well, that\u2019s pretty much it. As you may know, Microsoft is planning on overhauling the UI of Windows with their \u201cSun Valley\u201d update, which aims to unify the design of the OS. However, as we can see, Windows is one behemoth of an operating system. Will their efforts to finally make a cohesive user experience succeed? Only time will tell.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 10:29:21", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "windows,windows-10", "title":

", "note_en": "When dabbling with the laws of motion in the 17th century, Isaac Newton first realized that it\u2019s indeed possible to send an object out of Earth, into space. As long as an object is shot away from Earth with a high enough velocity, it  will reach space and orbit our planet.\n With the launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957 onboard a powerful rocket, the Soviet Union achieved exactly that. For the first time in four billion years of life on Earth, something was intentionally sent to space.\n  Give a satellite another speed boost, by either launching it on a more powerful rocket or using thrusters onboard, and it can escape from Earth\u2019s gravitational hold completely. That\u2019s how you can send missions to  Venus,  Mars,  Saturn and beyond. But one of these two things is not like the other.\n  The rocket equation is what allows scientists and engineers to quantify and compare the energy required to reach various destinations in space. Its implications are far-reaching but not intuitive so I shall attempt to explain them without use of any math.\n  The rocket equation tells us that the amount of energy a rocket must expend to go from the Earth\u2019s surface to an orbit 250 kilometers above, called low Earth orbit, is almost thrice as much as going from that low Earth orbit to the Moon! Likewise, getting to low Earth orbit costs twice as much energy than what is required to reach Mars from that same orbit. 1\n Even if we include the energy expenditure to land on the Moon instead of just reaching it from low Earth orbit, getting to Earth orbit itself turns out to be about 50% more expensive. In other words, attaining Earth orbit is the first and the most significant barrier to space exploration.\n  The giant leap for humanity was not stepping on the Moon but getting to Earth orbit.\n The rocket equation doesn\u2019t just dictate how much energy you must spend to reach various destinations in space but also if you can reach space at all.\n  The satellite is but a small fraction of the total mass of the rocket that lifts it and yet has an effect on the rocket itself. Therein lies the core problem of rocket science.\n Increasing the satellite\u2019s mass, to make it more useful perhaps, also means more rocket fuel is required to put the satellite in the desired orbit. But more fuel makes the system weigh more. This means some more fuel is required to launch the now-heavier system into space. As a thumb rule, fuel requirements increase  exponentially with every step increase in mass added to the satellite.\n This is how we end up with rockets being mostly fuel and then some metal. Even the mighty Saturn V that sent astronauts to the Moon was 85% fuel, 13% rocket\u2014including the rocket body, its plumbing and parts\u2014and the rest 2% being the Moonbound spacecraft with astronauts sitting inside!\n  At this point, if we were to make Earth more massive, a rocket would have to expend an enormous amount of energy against a more gruesome gravity well. More fuel would be required to get to space, and your rocket might be something akin to 9 times more fuel than metal. Increase Earth\u2019s mass further and the fuel-to-mass ratio would start  skyrocketing to a point where it\u2019s simply not possible to engineer such a near-all-fuel rocket!\n Crunching the numbers in this manner, it turns out that if the Earth was 50% more massive, you simply wouldn\u2019t be able to get to space even with the most energetic fuel combination\u2014liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen\u2014available in chemical rockets.\n Such a massive rocky planet is not imaginary, several of its kind exist. Of the over 4,000 planets around other stars we\u2019ve discovered to date in our galaxy, about a thousand are something scientists call \u2018Super Earths\u2019. These are planets which are up to 10 times more massive than Earth and up to twice as large. Beyond that limit, planets don\u2019t remain rocky and start turning into  Uranus- or  Neptune-like gas giants.\n  Many of these Super Earths lie in the respective habitable zones around their stars i.e. conditions there could support life as we know it. Given that we\u2019ve only searched a small fraction of our galaxy for planets, it\u2019s fair to say there could be millions of Super Earths, many of which could host life.\n If intelligent life were to develop on these Super Earths, they\u2019d have a hard time building rockets that get things off-planet. Since even the most energetic chemical rockets won\u2019t get them to space, they\u2019d be incentivized to build something with more thrust that can, like nuclear propulsion based rockets. These will likely be far more expensive than chemical rockets but sometimes nature doesn\u2019t give you a choice.\n  Just like the rocket equation makes it exponentially harder to get off a planet with added mass to the planet, it also makes it exponentially easier to get off objects with lesser gravity. Now if only we had an object less massive than Earth that is accessible and resourceful.\n  In order for humanity to survive and thrive long term, it makes sense to have a permanent human settlement on Mars as it offers us a relatively benign environment. Doing so would require sending hundreds to thousands of tons of material from Earth to the martian surface via dozens to hundreds of huge rocket launches. That\u2019s pretty much exactly what  SpaceX\u2019s Starship hopes to do. Here\u2019s where our celestial neighbor, the Moon, can make things better.\n The Moon has a much weaker gravity than Earth, allowing rockets to take off with ease. This was most notable during the Apollo missions, when even a spacecraft hosting two astronauts  could make its way to lunar orbit. Moreover, the Moon lies at the outer edge of Earth\u2019s gravity well, meaning it\u2019s easy to escape our planet\u2019s pull completely if launched from the Moon. Almost five times easier in fact.\n If we establish a vast, permanent settlement on the Moon first, we can eventually tap into its resources to launch rockets from the Moon itself. NASA and ISRO missions have discovered  plenty of water ice on the Moon\u2019s poles. It\u2019s possible that future human habitats built from mining the metal-rich lunar soil tap into this water ice for consumption needs. This water can also be split into hydrogen and oxygen for use as rocket fuel. Rockets taking off from an industrially enabled Moonbase can ride the lunar interplanetary highway to reach Mars more efficiently than from Earth.\n  Sure, it would be expensive to build an industrial Moonbase but if the goal is to expand sustainably into the solar system, we\u2019re playing the game on the scale of hundreds to thousands of years. In this large scheme of things, the Moon can be  the rocket platform to build and expand a sustainable Mars presence for much cheaper than an equivalent one done from Earth.\n The Moon\u2019s accessibility, low gravity barrier, and resource potential are the reason why its proponents vouch for a sustainable return to the Moon first rather than targeting Mars. As the saying within the lunar circles goes:\n     The Moon\u2019s advantages may extend to making homes for ourselves in the outer solar system as well. The rocket equation tells us that even if objects in the outer reaches of the solar system may be closer to Mars than the Moon, the more massive red planet\u2019s deeper gravity well means more energy is required to get out of it than to reach those destinations from there.\n Getting to the asteroid belt from the Moon\u2019s surface is at least 40% less energy demanding for a rocket than from Mars\u2019 surface\u2014even though Mars is about  75 million kilometers closer to the belt! This is the difference gravity makes, and which the rocket equation allows us to see. The Moon can accelerate expanding our settlements to these resource-rich asteroids. Some of these objects, like Ceres and Vesta, can in turn play the same role as the Moon can for Mars and the asteroid belt, and expand human settlements to moons of Jupiter and Saturn, and beyond.\n  This finally brings us to the single most important takeaway from the rocket equation. The ability to extract and harness raw materials from low-gravity, resourceful space objects would free us from the tyranny of dragging everything out of Earth\u2019s gravitational pull.\n We cannot hope to be traveling among the stars if we don\u2019t even expand into the solar system in an Earth-independent way and avail for ourselves a much larger resource pool. In-space manufacturing and industrialization is not just a good-to-have but a fundamental requirement for  expansion into the solar system. Only then humanity will be in an adequate position to venture to the nearest star and hopefully do it  before the Sun doesn\u2019t shine.\n   This article was made possible thanks to\u00a0 Dr. Gordon Roesler and  Justin Alva supporting me on Patreon.\n   Like what you read?\u00a0All my articles are free, with no ads.\u00a0 Support me\u00a0to keep me going.\n  1 Technically, energy expenditure is not the same as delta-v, which is the actual measure of work required by rockets to reach different destinations.

Here we present a novel approach forestimating the spatial distribution of surveillance cameras: applying computervision algorithms to large-scale street view image data. Specifically, we builda camera detection model and apply it to 1.6 million street view images sampledfrom 10 large U.S. cities and 6 other major cities around the world, withpositive model detections verified by human experts. After adjusting for theestimated recall of our model, and accounting for the spatial coverage of oursampled images, we are able to estimate the density of surveillance camerasvisible from the road. Across the 16 cities we consider, the estimated numberof surveillance cameras per linear kilometer ranges from 0.1 (in Seattle) to0.9 (in Seoul). In a detailed analysis of the 10 U.S. cities, we find thatcameras are concentrated in commercial, industrial, and mixed zones, and inneighborhoods with higher shares of non-white residents -- a pattern thatpersists even after adjusting for land use.

prove inadequate to cover the costs of unprecedented joblessness caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a new report warns.\n Even as the economy is rebounding, unemployment remains high, and the debt is forecast to grow beyond the $24.3 billion estimated for the end of this year, state officials said.\n Business leaders said Friday that as borrowing from the federal unemployment trust fund is paid back by higher payroll taxes, state officials must tap more of a projected budget surplus to lessen the financial hit on employers already struggling to recover from the economic shutdown of the last year.\n \u201cIf they don\u2019t do anything more, businesses are going to end up having to pay that tax at a critical time of our economic recovery,\u201d said Rob Lapsley, president of the California Business Roundtable. \u201cIf some [businesses] are teetering on the edge of a fiscal cliff, it could drive them right over the edge, and they go out of business.\u201d\n  California has processed a record 22.5 million unemployment claims since the COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020, and the state has paid $150 billion in benefits.\n The report, released this week by the state Employment Development Department, poses a new challenge for Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislators after months of unresolved problems with the unemployment system.\n Employers pay federal and state taxes into unemployment insurance funds on behalf of each employee on their payroll. When the fund runs low, states can tap into assistance from the federal government to ensure that regular benefit payments can continue to be paid.\n But  money borrowed from the federal government is paid back through an increase in the payroll tax that gradually rises each year, hitting more than 3% after 10 years, until the debt is repaid.\n  The EDD debt forecast report noted that employer contributions are estimated to increase from $4.8 billion this year to $6 billion next year. The independent Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office estimates that the total debt may not be paid off until 2031.\n The expanding debt has touched off a dispute among state leaders over how much of the surplus should be put toward reducing the burden on businesses.\n Newsom recently announced that the state is projected to have a tax windfall of $76 billion, in addition to $27 billion the state will receive from the federal American Rescue Plan.\n   \u201cIt shows the commitment we have to get a jump-start on that payment,\u201d Newsom said last month, when he unveiled his budget proposal. \u201cEvery state in the country will struggle over the course of many, many years to pay back that debt, as we did in the last recession, the Great Recession, when it took a number of years.\u201d\n During the recession of a decade ago, California borrowed $10.7 billion from the federal trust fund to pay unemployment benefits; it took the state from 2011 to 2018 to repay the debt.\n This time, California is one of 19 states that have had to borrow a combined $53 billion from the federal trust fund to cover unemployment benefits during the pandemic. Other states that took loans include Massachusetts, Illinois, New York and Texas, but California has borrowed the most by far \u2014 more than 40% of the total.\n The $1.1 billion proposed by the governor is \u201ca step in the right direction,\u201d according to Jennifer Barrera, executive vice president of the California Chamber of Commerce.\n  \u201cHowever, in order to protect small businesses and other employers devastated by the pandemic from the risk of increased taxes and more economic uncertainty, the state needs to be far more aggressive in paying off the entire debt as soon as possible,\u201d Barrera said.\n As an alternative to Newsom\u2019s plan, the Legislature has proposed $2 billion in payroll tax credits to small employers, spread over 10 years. The two sides are still negotiating on the proposals, and Lapsley has proposed that a working group be formed to resolve the issue. He said even the legislative proposal of $200 million a year is not enough to prevent burdensome tax increases on businesses, and would hit the service and hospitality industries especially hard.\n The state\u2019s response to the unemployment system debt has been called inadequate by some lawmakers.\n \u201cIf it is not addressed in a significantly and substantial way, it will lead to higher taxes paid for and by our already struggling small businesses,\u201d said Assemblyman Vince Fong (R-Bakersfield), vice chairman of the Assembly Budget Committee.\n  Some legislators noted that EDD officials said the agency has identified at least $11 billion in benefits paid on fraudulent claims. While the vast majority of fraud occurred on claims in a federal program, some of the fraud payments are liabilities of the state.\n \u201cThis debt was incurred because of the mismanagement of our state government, not by our local small businesses,\u201d Fong told colleagues during Monday\u2019s floor debate on the budget. \u201cThe lack of action will only lead to a higher tax burden that hardworking Californians will have to bear in the future.\u201d\n In October, the EDD thought California\u2019s loan balance might hit $48 billion this year, but the estimate was revised downward after some officials cited factors that include many employers transitioning large numbers of employees to remote working.\n   \u201cThe bottom line is that saddling California businesses with what is estimated to amount to a $26.7-billion tax increase or more over the next 10 years will divert resources away from their ability to regain losses sustained during the pandemic shutdowns and will hamper California\u2019s overall economic recovery,\u201d said Barrera.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 10:27:32", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5931\u4e1a,unemployment", "title": "\u52a0\u5dde\u7684\u5931\u4e1a\u503a\u52a1\u968f\u7740\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u51fa\u5e2e\u52a9\u800c\u589e\u957f ", "title_en": "California\u2019s unemployment debt grows as businesses ask Newsom for help", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-18/california-unemployment-debt-grows-businesses-ask-newsom-for-help", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5931\u4e1a"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "0df4a8b8d879e968da2daac42d6b79ea.jpg", "infoid": 1066815, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u60a3\u8005\u5df2\u5728Biontech\u4e2d\u7684II\u671f\u764c\u75c7\u75ab\u82d7\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6cbb\u7597\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u57fa\u4e8emRNA\u7684\u6cbb\u7597BNT111\u4e0eLibtaYo\uff08Cemiplimab\uff09\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u6297PD1-\u96be\u6cbb/\u590d\u53d1\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u5207\u9664\u9636\u6bb5III\u6216IV\u9ed1\u8272\u7d20\u7624\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\u5f00\u653e\u6807\u7b7e\u968f\u673a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u5c06\u8bc4\u4f30BNT111\u4e0eLibtayo\u7684\u7597\u6548\uff0c\u8010\u53d7\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u5b83\u5c06\u6ce8\u518c120\u540d\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u4ee3\u7406\u5546\u3002 BNT111\u662fBiontech FixVac\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u94c5\u4ea7\u54c1\u5019\u9009\u8005\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9MRNA\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u80bf\u7624\u76f8\u5173\u6297\u539f\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bf9\u764c\u75c7\u7684\u5f3a\u70c8\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u514d\u75ab\u5e94\u7b54\u3002\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u7531Biontech\u5b8c\u5168\u62e5\u6709\uff0c\u800cLibtayo\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6297PD-1\u5355\u514b\u9686\u6297\u4f53\uff0c\u662f\u7531Regeneron\u548cSanofi\u5171\u540c\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u3002 \u201cBNT111\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9759\u8109\u6cbb\u7597\u764c\u75c7\u75ab\u82d7\u5019\u9009\u5019\u9009\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u56db\u7ec4\u764c\u75c7\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6297\u539f\u9488\u5bf9\u514d\u75ab\u539f\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u5e76\u4f5c\u4e3aRNA-Lipoplex\u5236\u5242\u9012\u9001\uff0c\u201dBiontech\u8bf4\u3002\u636e\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u636e\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c90\uff05\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u9ed1\u7d20\u7624\u8868\u8fbe\u4e86BNT11\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u56db\u79cd\u80bf\u7624\u76f8\u5173\u6297\u539f\u4e2d\u7684\u81f3\u5c11\u4e00\u79cd;

The open-label randomised trial will assess the efficacy, tolerability and safety of BNT111 in combination with Libtayo. It will enrol 120 patients and will evaluate the effects of the combination, as well as stand-alone individual agents. BNT111 is the lead product candidate from BioNTech\u2019s FixVac platform and targets a fixed combination of mRNA-encoded, tumour-associated antigens, with the aim of activating a strong and precise immune response against cancer.     The candidate is fully owned by BioNTech while Libtayo, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, is being co-developed by Regeneron and Sanofi. \u201cBNT111 is an intravenous therapeutic cancer vaccine candidate encoding for a fixed set of four cancer-specific antigens optimised for immunogenicity and delivered as RNA-lipoplex formulation,\u201d says BIoNTech. According to the firm, more than 90% of melanomas in patients express at least one of the four tumour-associated antigens encoded in BNT11; NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A3, tyrosinase and TPTE.   The BNT111-01 trial, which is being carried out in collaboration with Regeneron, was reviewed and approved by the regulatory authorities in EU countries Spain, Germany, Italy and Poland as well as in the UK, the US and Australia. The first patient has been dosed in the EU. The primary endpoint of the study is to assess the overall response rate of BNT111 in combination with Libtayo. Secondary endpoints include overall response rate in the single-agent arms, duration of response and safety. \u201cOur vision is to harness the power of the immune system against cancer and infectious diseases. We were able to demonstrate the potential of mRNA vaccines in addressing Covid-19. We must not forget, that cancer is also a global health threat, even worse than the current pandemic,\u201d said BioNTech\u2019s co-founder and CMO \u00d6zlem T\u00fcreci. \u201cBNT111 has already shown a favourable safety profile and encouraging preliminary results in early clinical evaluation. With the start of patient treatment in our Phase II trial, we are encouraged to continue on our initial path to realise the potential of mRNA vaccines for cancer patients.\u201d    This Phase II trial is based on previous results from the Phase I Lipo-MERIT dose-escalation trial that confirmed a favourable safety profile in 89 patients with advanced melanoma. Additionally, efficacy analysis of the Lipo-MERIT study in a subset of 42 metastatic melanoma patients treated earlier with a checkpoint-inhibitor demonstrated that BNT111 mediated durable responses, both as a single agent and in combination with anti-PD-1 antibodies. Durable objective responses by BNT111 were associated with activation and strong expansion of tumor-antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These results were published in   Nature in July 2020. BioNTech also plans to start randomised Phase II trials with mRNA vaccine product candidates in two additional programs in 2021. \u201cAs part of its development strategy, BioNTech aims to rapidly advance its broad oncology pipeline and expects to bring additional candidates into late-stage clinical development and towards market entry within the next five years,\u201d said the firm.",

  \u6807\u51c6 ", "note_en": "Below are some thoughts that I put together in my journey to learn how to become a better manager of engineers. The learning journey continues.\n     You must have a vision of where you would like the team to go. A team needs to have long term goals that fit within the organization. Imagine the most perfect version of your team. What should it do? Should it evolve to several teams? Should it focus on fewer responsibilities? Should your team build a new product or process? ..etc. The \u201cmost perfect version\u201d of a team is subjective, it will likely differ from one person to the next. So feel free to consult your leaders, your team, you peers, what have you. However, it\u2019s on you to put the vision together, or else your management career will devolve into a series of reactions.\n Having said all that, a vision without a strategy is a work of fiction. A fancy idea that will stay an idea. Think of small incremental steps that follow your paths of least resistance to get to your vision. Those small incremental steps become your strategy. Some steps you\u2019ll get right, others you will get wrong. Fail fast, learn, then iterate.\n A strategy without execution is still akin to a work of fiction, more of hard fiction though as opposed to a fancy idea. Execution is taking action, following the steps of your strategy, making things happen, and bringing the vision to reality piece by piece. Believe it or not, but there is a big difference between planning to build a piece of software vs actually building it!\n This is much easier said than done. Orgs change, priorities shift, and no vision is set in stone. You need to be acutely aware of this simple fact &amp; to be ready to change when change is needed. Your strategy will then have to adapt. As in, you\u2019ll have to salvage whatever you can from the existing strategy, then build newer incremental steps that align with the new vision. If you wait for too long, you\u2019ll become stagnant, a slow wheel! Who wants that?!\n  You are responsible for the success and the growth of the people who report to you. You must deeply understand and know your people. The first thing you should know is what motivates them. Some people are motivated by praise, others are motivated by cash, others like to have big impacts. Humans are very sophisticated creatures, we don\u2019t always know what we need or what we want.\n You have to stretch your people a bit and get a feeling for their boundaries. They may be hesitant to make moves, because they might be worried of failure or blame. You have to supply an environment where it was ok to fail, but fail fast and iterate quickly. As your people grow, you grow, your team grows, and your org grows.\n Stretching your people doesn\u2019t mean pushing against their paths of most resistance. You have to align your strategy with your people. For example, if in your strategy you plan to execute heavy user outreach, don\u2019t assign the task to an engineer who\u2019d much prefer to stay awake at 3 AM to figure out a software bug! And no, not all engineers like to do engineering work at the wee hours of the night. And yes, some engineers actually do enjoy user outreach.\n Don\u2019t assume your people are happy. You have to take steps to first know whether they are happy, and then take steps to make them happy if they are not.\n  You have to figure out how build alignments beyond your team. This not only includes other teams, but also key stakeholders, and with neighboring orgs. Key stakeholders are not just other leaders, or your customers. Key stakeholders include the scrappy technician, the genius engineer, the experienced product manager, the passionate program manager, the data driven project manager..etc. They are the ones who can actually make things happen, because they possess the \u2018street knowledge\u2019. They are the ones who know the limitations, the gotchas &amp; the shortcuts in the technology and in the process. If your strategy does not offer wins to other teams or key stakeholders, then your strategy is wrong. Building efficient and ongoing alignment with other stakeholders and organizations is so important for your team\u2019s growth and evolution.\n You need to identify the win-wins, and incorporate it in your strategy , even if it\u2019ll theoretically take a bit of more time. That is because win-win strategies are the most likely to happen. Win-wins mean that you win &amp; others win too, even if you don\u2019t get every single thing that you want. Once you identify the win-wins, share them with other stakeholders, then iterate and evolve. Make stakeholders feel included. Don\u2019t assume they will feel included, you need to make some efforts.\n   Standard", "posttime": "2021-06-19 09:44:39", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News",

popular belief among young people in the United States today. According to  one survey, 68% of American millennials &#34;agree&#34; or &#34;strongly agree&#34; that they have &#34;more, tougher financial obstacles than previous generations&#34; and 49% believe that they are &#34;living in the worst economic environment in the last century.&#34;\n To be clear, this perception isn&#39;t based on literally  nothing\u2014there are some dimensions along which young people have it worse. But as far as I can tell, this belief, when taken as a whole, is completely, ludicrously false. Pants on fire. It&#39;s not even close to being right.\n Not only are young people not worse off than previous generations, they are better off along nearly every meaningful economic axis.\n   The first most obvious thing to point out is that real GDP per capita\u2014meaning, adjusted for costs of living\u2014is  up about 374% since 1950. If GDP is calculated correctly, it should correspond to mean income levels, which means that the mean income among people alive today is nearly four times higher than it was in 1950.\n  We can also look at the  growth in average personal consumption, which has risen about 950% since 1950, clearly indicating that Americans today have far more  disposable income than in the past.\n  Mean statistics might be misleading of course, since outliers can skew the data (see also the section in this post on inequality). But when you look at statistics tracking median income, you see a similar trend. The U.S. Census Bureau  reports that median household income in 1984 was $52,679, but was $68,703 in 2019, a 30% gain.\n Now, there is a legitimate question of whether these gains have been felt by the younger generations. The National Center for Education Statistics  reveals that real incomes have only increased slightly\u2014about 9%\u2014in the last 25 years for people between the ages of 25 and 34.\n  My first reply is that it\u2019s important to note that median income data can understate the true increases of living standards. That&#39;s because data sources oftentimes only include people&#39;s after-tax take-home pay, after deducting worker benefits like health insurance. When you try to include these benefits, the  growth in real income has been much larger than these statistics generally show.\n My second reply is that, ethically speaking, even if these gains merely reflected the fact that old people are getting richer, rather than young people, it wouldn&#39;t make much of a difference to my general argument, as millennials will eventually get older, and thus benefit from these gains just as old people do now.\n To some, these statistics aren\u2019t enough to show that millennials aren\u2019t doing better. In the face of these statistics, lots of people will still argue that young people are worse off in more subtle ways. Here are some of the most common of these objections and my rebuttals:\n  Yes, but it&#39;s not clear that those things imply that standards of living are declining in any meaningful way. Arguably, the main reason why costs have gone up in these areas is because society is richer, and thus more willing to bear the cost of better facilities and higher wages for healthcare and education workers. This effect is known as  Baumol&#39;s cost disease.\n Health care and education are in many ways  positional goods, though it would probably take a book to compellingly argue for this thesis (here are two:  education and  health care). In this sense, rising costs in these areas don\u2019t necessarily indicate lowering standards of living\u2014quite the opposite in fact.\n As an analogy, imagine if the cost of jewelry went up. Which of the following is more likely to have been the cause of this rise in price: that some combination of greed and exploitation caused sellers to raise their prices, or that people have more disposable income now, and therefore demand more expensive jewelry?\n Consistent with this thesis, healthcare spending and costs  tend to strongly correlate with disposable income. If you believed that rising healthcare costs were indicative of a lowering standard of living, then you should also probably believe that people in the poorest nations on Earth have the highest standards of living\u2014which is obviously absurd.\n   If the main reason why college and healthcare is so expensive is because society is now richer than it was before, then that would imply the opposite of what people normally claim here: that young people have it worse than previous generations.\n But today people need a college degree in order to survive. Back in my parent&#39;s days, you could just get a well paying job as a factory worker right out of high school.\n Yes, credential inflation is a real problem (and one whose  solution is precisely the  opposite of &#34;we need to encourage more people to go to college&#34;), however, the National Center for Education Statistics  data shows almost no difference in median incomes among non-college graduates over the last 25 years. It seems that it has at least not gotten harder recently to enjoy a minimum standard of living without a college degree.\n  The average cost of housing  has gone up over time, but this trend is mainly driven by the fact that modern houses are larger and built better than houses in the past. For example, the average house size has  more than doubled since the 1950s, and new housing must pass stringent regulation to ensure that e.g. there is no lead paint. What matters most is whether people can afford the same quality of housing than their parents and grandparents were able to afford. And the  Zillow mortgage affordability index has tracked the affordability of housing relative to people&#39;s real incomes and  finds that people today have an easier time buying housing relative to their incomes than the previous generations.\n The decline of home ownership is also overblown. Overall, the home ownership rate has actually  slightly risen since the 1960s, though it did enter a decline after peaking in the early 2000s. During nearly this whole period, home ownership rates have stayed within a narrow 6% window from 63% to 69%.\n  [Note: In an illustration of just how nuanced debates about housing prices can get, a user on Reddit pointed out that  the median age of homebuyers has gone from 31 to 47 in the last 4 decades as evidence that the above chart was misleading. But that\u2019s  all homebuyers. When you look at the age of first-home buyers, the trend has  barely budged, rising by a few years since 1981. So, lots people are buying more than one home now\u2014not exactly economic decline.]\n That said, I agree with people who have complained about  burdensome regulations unnecessarily restricting the supply of housing, thus raising prices, and I do hope millennials can be wise enough to eventually repeal this bad policy.\n  Not right now, no. Although student loan debt has increased greatly in recent decades,  the generation with the most debt is technically Generation X. The baby boomers aren&#39;t that far behind either.\n   Debt is also more affordable than it was 40 or 50 years ago. For example, mortgage interest rates have  declined sharply.\n  In the future, millennials will likely take on more debt than their parents, but this won\u2019t necessarily be a bad thing. One of the main functions of debt is to smooth consumption over time. The basic idea is that if you expect to be much richer in the future, it makes sense to take out a lot of debt so that you can enjoy a high standard of living right now, and pay the debt off later. In fact,  nations with the highest average household debt also tend to be the richest. Therefore, rising levels of debt often indicate rising standards of living, not the opposite.\n I should note that this argument can also neatly explain why I\u2019m not worried about the slight decline in relative net worth among millennials as, for instance, talked about in  this recent Bloomberg article.\n  Firstly, economic inequality does not directly determine standards of living. You can have a highly unequal society with high median standards of living, just as you can have a highly equal society with low median standards of living.\n Secondly, whether inequality has gotten worse depends on which statistics you are looking at. The most common measure used to determine inequality is the  Gini coefficient of pre-tax income. In my opinion, this is a bad measure of inequality, as it doesn&#39;t take into account the redistributive effects of taxes and government transfers. It also doesn\u2019t take into account the fact that people&#39;s income will grow over time as their career progresses; a society in which everyone receives the same amount of lifetime income, but in which young people earn lower wages than older people, will be seen as unequal by this measure, which seems ethically arbitrary.\n Another bad measure is wealth inequality, which neglects the reality of consumption smoothing. Under this measure, old people who have saved money for retirement are counted as rich, even if they have a low standard of living, and young medical school graduates who took on a lot debt are counted as poor, even if they are in the top 1% of income earners. It\u2019s not clear why we should care about inequality caused purely by people choosing to save money rather than spend it frivolously.\n Put another way, if Jeff Bezos spent $10 billion to personally fly to the moon and back, this would decrease national wealth inequality compared to just holding stock. And, investing does have social value,  even if it produces inequities.\n For these reasons, I think the only measure of inequality that you should be concerned about is  consumption inequality across one\u2019s lifetime, that is, inequality between people in what they actually purchase to sustain their lifestyle during their lifespan. Numerous studies have found that consumption inequality has  stayed roughly constant since the 1960s.\n   It is true that the 2008 and 2020 economic crises were bad in terms of their effects on employment. However, it&#39;s not clear that this overall economic era is worse than prior eras in terms of employment. The early 1980s recession  saw an unemployment rate of 10.8%, exceeding the maximum experienced during the 2008 financial crisis. The 2020 recession saw even greater unemployment at 14.8%, but this was an extremely acute effect of coronavirus lockdowns. By late 2020, unemployment had nearly returned to historically normal levels. Furthermore, before the 2020 recession, the unemployment rate was at the lowest point it had been in over 50 years.\n  Sure, but millennials were hit with the Great Recession, and now we\u2019re hit with the coronavirus recession.\n The Great Recession was bad relative to previous recessions following the Great Depression. But that\u2019s not the greatest measure of whether quality of life was worse during that time period compared to the past.\n To start, the  frequency of recessions has declined over time in US history. Being hit with only two recessions in one generation actually a historical aberration, when you take a longer-view perspective. The period between 2009-2020 was in fact  the longest period of uninterrupted growth in US history.\n Our expectations tend to warp our experience. Look, a recession is usually defined as some sort of decline in GDP or consumer spending. When GDP goes up by 2%, we don\u2019t call that an anti-recession, or a \u201cboom.\u201d We just call it normal life, since growth rates like that are what we\u2019ve been conditioned to accept.\n When the norm is for things to get better, sometimes mere stagnation can make things seem like things are taking a nosedive. Humans seem to have a  persistent bias towards perceiving that things are getting worse. But it\u2019s important to keep your mind open to the bigger picture. At the bottom of the Great Recession, in quarter 2 of 2009, real GDP per capita  declined to\u2026 the level it was previously at in 2004, just 5 years earlier.\n I know that GDP per capita is not a perfect measure for measuring quality of life. Yet I also know of no other good aggregate measures which don\u2019t follow something similar to this pattern.\n  It\u2019s true that the federal minimum wage   has  declined when adjusted for inflation since the 1970s.\n   However, the minimum wage establishes, as per its name, a  minimum wage level. It doesn&#39;t tell us much about average standard of living. Most states also set  their own minimum wages higher than the federal level.\n Furthermore, since the 1970s\u2014the period of a declining minimum wage\u2014 welfare transfers to the poor went up, arguably raising the minimum standard of living. This rising minimum standard can be illustrated by, for example, the fact that the proportion of Americans who live in severely crowded housing has been  cut by over 75% since 1975, and that air conditioning is  seven times more prevalent among poor households now than in the 1960s.\n  When I first learned in my high school textbooks about the &#34;booming&#34; economic environment of the 1950s, I gathered a sense that the US economy might have already peaked. This opinion was then, and still is, backed by common wisdom that boomers were handed the world on a silver platter and proceeded to ruin it. But when I started looking into real evidence, I found that this concept was based on little more than misconception and a handful of misleading statistics.\n This all makes sense from a psychological perspective. Many young people probably just find it convenient to believe that they have experienced undue economic hardship, since they can win sympathy that way. And most people naturally think that we should care about the plight of young folks more than old folks.\n Nearly everyone is aware of new technological developments, and so they\u2019re probably cognizant in some sense that things are better than before. Yet, most remain unaware that ordinary measures of standards of living are up too.
