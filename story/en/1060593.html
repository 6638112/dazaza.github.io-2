Abagnale Jr. may have pulled off one of the greatest hoaxes on earth.</p><p>Frank W. Abagnale Jr.可能已经拉开了地球上最伟大的恶作剧之一。</p><p> Abagnale’s famous tale of forging checks and assuming different professional identities has captured national audiences through pop-culture adaptations, most famously the 2002 Steven Spielberg film, “Catch Me if You Can,” starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. It was developed from  Abagnale’s memoir of the same name.</p><p> Abagnale着名的锻造支票故事和假设不同的专业身份通过流行文化适应捕获了国家观众，最着名的2002年史蒂文斯皮尔伯格电影，“如果可以的话，”抓住我，“莱昂纳多迪奥帕里奥和汤姆汉克斯主演。它是从Abagnale的同名内容开发的。</p><p> The story goes that between the mid-1960s and the early 1970s, Abagnale lived out many lives as an impostor. He pretended to be a pilot for Pan American airlines, a doctor in Georgia, a lawyer for the attorney general’s office in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and a professor at Brigham Young University. He also cashed more than $2 million worth of bad checks in over 26 countries. All this, he claimed, while still a teenager and while being chased by the FBI.</p><p> 故事介于20世纪60年代中期和20世纪70年代初，Abagnale住在许多生命中作为冒名顶替者。他假装成为泛美航空公司，佐治亚州的一名医生的飞行员，该一名律师在巴吞鲁日，路易斯安那州的律师公司，路易斯安那州的律师公司和Brigham Young University教授。他还兑现了超过26个国家的价值超过200万美元的糟糕检查。所有这一切，他声称，仍然是一个少年，而在FBI被追逐。</p><p>   But though the movie claims to be based on a true story, creating the myth of Frank W. Abagnale Jr. might be the best con that Abagnale actually pulled. A new book contends that the story of the charming teen running from the FBI and pulling off all those impersonations without getting caught is mostly made up.</p><p>   但是，虽然电影声称基于真实的故事，但是创造了弗兰克W.Abagnale Jr的神话可能是滥用行动的最佳配置。一本新书争辩说，迷人的青少年的故事从联邦调查局运行并拉下所有没有被捕获的冒险而不陷入困境。</p><p> Science journalist Alan C. Logan remembers watching the film on videocassette after it came out and thinking that there was just something off about it.</p><p> 科学记者Alan C. Logan记得在它出来后观看录像带上的电影，认为没有关于它的事情。</p><p> “I remember just having this nagging feeling and that something just wasn’t quite right about it,” Logan said. “And that was that. That thought, you know, went into the back of my mind for a couple of decades almost.”</p><p> “我记得只是有这种唠叨的感觉，”洛根说，这是一个不太可能的事情，“洛根说。 “那就是这样。那个想法，你知道，几十年来才进入我的脑海。“</p><p> Logan eventually revisited that nagging feeling. In early 2020, he wrote a book about  Robert Vernon Spears, a medical con man who was the suspect in a mysterious commercial airline disaster in 1959.</p><p> 洛根最终重新审视了唠叨的感觉。 2020年初，他写了一本关于Robert Vernon Spears的一本书，是1959年的一名医疗骗局的医疗骗局。 </p><p> “And everyone who read the book started comparing Spears, who was verifiable … to Abagnale, to ‘Catch Me if You Can.’ And I just thought, well, let me look into [it] a little bit. And nothing was adding up, nothing was verifiable.”</p><p>“那些阅读本书的每个人都开始比较矛，验证的矛......辱骂，如果你可以，我就会想到，好吧，让我看看[它]一点点。没有什么可以加起来，没有什么可核实的。“</p><p> Logan said what he found blew his mind. His book about it is called “ The Greatest Hoax on Earth: Catching Truth, While We Can.”</p><p> 洛根说他发现他的思绪。他关于它的书被称为“地球上最伟大的骗局：捕捉真理，而我们可以。”</p><p>  Logan used public records and newspaper clippings to find out the real story. He even spoke to people who knew Abagnale before the myth about his life took off, including a flight attendant Abagnale met in 1969 in an encounter that eventually led to his incarceration.</p><p>  洛根使用公共记录和报纸剪报来找出真实的故事。他甚至对那些在神话中脱掉的人谈到了辱骂的人，包括一名航班服务员在1969年在一个最终导致他的监禁的遇到遇到的竞赛者。</p><p> “What really happened was that, dressed as a TWA (Trans World Airlines) pilot, which he only did for a few weeks, [Abagnale] befriended a flight attendant called Paula Parks,” Logan said. “He followed her all over the Eastern Seaboard, identified her work schedule through deceptive means, and essentially stalked the woman.”</p><p> “真正发生的事情是，穿着曾经是一个TWA（Trans World Airlines）飞行员，他只做了几个星期，[Abagnale]与叫做Paula公园的乘务员交往，”Logan说。 “他跟着她们在东部的海岸上，通过欺骗手段确定了她的工作时间表，基本上追踪了这个女人。”</p><p> Parks didn’t know what to do with him. She tried to tell him that she wasn’t interested, but he was persistent. He even showed up at her apartment in New Orleans. She told him then that she was going to go visit her parents in Baton Rouge, and he tagged along.</p><p> 公园不知道该怎么办。她试图告诉他她不感兴趣，但他持久了。他甚至在新奥尔良的公寓出现。她告诉他，那时她要去巴吞胭脂，他打过父母，他标记。</p><p> “So Frank Abagnale meets her parents in Baton Rouge. Frank and Paula … part ways, and a few days later, Frank Abagnale shows back up at [her parents’] house in Baton Rouge and said, ‘Hey, I’m Paula’s friend. Remember me? I’m on furlough as a pilot.’ And they invited him in out of kindness.”</p><p> “如此，弗兰克·阿布纳尔在巴吞鲁日遇见了她的父母。 Frank和Paula ......部分方式，几天后，弗兰克·阿比特尔在巴吞鲁日的房子里击退并说，'嘿，我是宝拉的朋友。记得我？我正在休假作为飞行员。“他们邀请他出于善意。”</p><p> Abagnale stayed with the family for a while, in Parks’ room, and she was mortified. She didn’t trust him, but her family did. They cooked meals for him, and introduced him to people in Baton Rouge. He would take the family out to dinner and buy them flowers, earning their trust. All the while he was doing that with checks he stole from them, which he had rifled through. He stole about $1,200 from the family, and more from local businesses in Baton Rouge. In his book, Abagnale claimed that he never ripped off individuals, only hotels, airlines and banks.</p><p> Abagnale住在家里有一段时间，在公园的房间里，她被抚养了。她不相信他，但她的家人所做的。他们为他烹制了饭菜，并将他介绍给巴登胭脂的人。他会把家庭带出去吃饭，买他们的花朵，赚取他们的信任。他一切都在这样做，用检查他偷走了他，他已经逃避了。他偷了大约1,200美元的家庭，更多来自巴吞鲁日的当地企业。在他的书中，Abagnale声称他从未扯掉个人，只有酒店，航空公司和银行。 </p><p>  “So Abagnale’s narrative that between the ages of 16 and 20, he was on the run, chased all over the United States and even internationally by the FBI. This is completely fictitious,” Logan said. “Public records obtained by me show that he was confined for the most part in prison during those years.”</p><p>“所以辱骂的叙述，在16和20岁之间，他正在奔跑，在美国郊区追逐，甚至是国际联邦调查局。这是完全虚构的，“洛根说。 “由我获得的公共记录表明，在那些年内，他被局限于监狱大部分。”</p><p>  Abagnale was paroled in 1974, and moved to Friendswood, Texas, where he was arrested once again for theft. After Abagnale got out of prison, a parole officer encouraged him to tell his story of being a transformed man.</p><p>  Abagnale于1974年被宠起，并搬到了朋友德克萨斯州的朋友，在那里他再次被盗窃逮捕。 Abagnale离开监狱后，一个假释官鼓励他讲述他成为一个变革的人的故事。</p><p> It was an idea Abagnale ran with. At first, he started by giving small lectures, telling this story of redemption, but his tale grew larger and larger. He teamed up with a producer and eventually landed an appearance in 1977 on a national television show called “To Tell The Truth.”</p><p> 这是一个想法abagnale ran。起初，他首先讲授小讲座，讲述了这个救赎的故事，但他的故事变得更大，更大。他与生产者合作，并最终在1977年在一个名为“说实话”的国家电视节目中落地。</p><p> The premise of the show was that celebrity panelists had to identify the one person who was not lying, out of three people claiming to be the same person. Logan said there was no fact-checking on “To Tell The Truth.”</p><p> 节目的前提是名人小组成员不得不确定一个没有撒谎的人，其中三个人声称是同一个人。洛根说“说实话”没有事实上检查。</p><p> “And perhaps for the first time in this show’s history, you had three liars on the stage. Two of them were instructed to lie. And then Abagnale told multiple lies about his biography on that show.”</p><p> “也许是在这个节目中的第一次，你在舞台上有三个骗子。其中两个被指示撒谎。然后abagnale告诉多个谎言他的传记。“</p><p>  Once Abagnale was on “To Tell The Truth,” he was a hit. The game show led to further  opportunities on national TV.  Later that same year, he was featured on the “Today” show with Tom Brokaw. Soon after, he was on “The Tonight Show” with Johnny Carson.</p><p>  一旦辱骂是“说实话”，他就是一个击中。游戏显示导致国家电视的进一步的机会。同年晚些时候，他在“今天”秀与汤姆德国展示。不久之后，他与约翰尼卡森一起“今晚的秀”。</p><p> While most people were mesmerized by the story of the con man who impersonated a pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, and a college professor, some were not as convinced.</p><p> 虽然大多数人被欺骗飞行员，医生，律师和大学教授的骗局的故事迷住了，但有些人并不是那么令人信服。 </p><p>    “There is amazing journalism in 1978,” Logan said. “Stephen Hall, as a rookie journalist working for the San Francisco Chronicle, saw Abagnale on ‘The Tonight Show’ in 1978 and started to query some of the claims.”</p><p>“1978年有惊人的新闻，”洛根说。 “斯蒂芬大厅，作为为旧金山纪事的新手，1978年在”今晚的秀“上看到了Abagnale，并开始查询一些索赔。”</p><p> For example, Abagnale described stealing money from a deposit drop at Logan Airport dressed as a security guard, with the help of two Massachusetts state troopers.</p><p> 例如，借助两个马萨诸塞州士兵的帮助，从洛根机场的存款下降中描述了销售销售的押金。</p><p>   Two months later, another journalist took on the Abagnale tale. Ira Perry, a reporter for The Daily Oklahoman, did a line-by-line debunking of the story when Abagnale was scheduled to visit Oklahoma City for one of his talks.</p><p>   两个月后，另一名记者接受了辱骂的故事。当时俄克拉拉曼的记者佩里·佩里，当Abagnale计划访问俄克拉荷马城市的谈判时，逐行逐行揭示故事。</p><p> Perry investigated some of Abagnale’s bigger claims, including that he recruited young women at the University of Arizona to tour Europe with him on Pan Am’s dime and that he stole $2.5 million from them through bad checks. The scene with the flight attendants was dramatized in the movie version.</p><p> 佩里调查了一些阿比纳尔的更大的索赔，包括他招募了亚利桑那大学的年轻女性，在潘am的角钱上与他一起招募欧洲，并且他通过糟糕的支票偷走了250万美元。空姐的场景在电影版中戏剧化。</p><p>  When Perry asked Pan Am spokesperson Bruce Haxthausen about the company’s financial losses, he denied that Abagnale had ever stolen the money.</p><p>  当佩里问潘发言人Bruce Haxthausen关于公司的经济损失，他否认了Abagnale曾经偷过这笔钱。</p><p> “I’ve checked with the security people and everyone here, and it never happened,” Haxthausen told Perry. “This is the first we’ve heard of this, and we would have heard or at least remember[ed] it if it had happened. You don’t forget $2.5 million in bad checks. I’d say this guy is as phony as a $3 bill.”</p><p> “我和安全人员和每个人一起检查过，它从未发生过，”Haxthausen告诉Perry。 “这是我们听说过的第一个，如果发生这种情况，我们就会听到或至少记得[ED]。您不会忘记250万美元的糟糕检查。我会说这个家伙像3美元的钞票一样。“</p><p>  And while Hall and Perry were able to unravel the story behind some of Abagnale’s claims, his rising star overshadowed those claims.</p><p>  虽然大厅和佩里能够解开一些辱骂的索赔背后的故事，但他的崛起明星掩盖了这些索赔。 </p><p> “Much like Stephen Hall, Ira Perry was a rookie journalist up for a challenge and did just really stunning research that really helped me in my quest,” Logan said. “Now, the problem in the pre- digital era, the San Francisco Chronicle piece by Hall and The Daily Oklahoman piece by Ira Perry didn’t really go anywhere. It just stayed locally in the environment. And Abagnale was still hopping, skipping and jumping all over the country and selling it and getting onto shows.”</p><p>“就像斯蒂芬大厅一样，伊拉佩里是一位挑战的新秀记者，这确实只是真正令人惊叹的研究，真正帮助了我的追求，”洛根说。 “现在，数字时代的问题，旧金山编年史作者讲大厅和日常俄克拉万赛的奥克拉·佩里斯特真正去任何地方。它刚刚在环境中呆在本地。辱骂仍然跳跃，跳跃和跳跃全国各地并卖掉它并进入展示。“</p><p>  Logan writes that these articles debunking Abagnale’s claims were no more than a little speed bump in his rise to fame. Abagnale was asked to come back to “The Tonight Show” multiple times after his first appearance. And, when asked about the journalism claiming to have debunked his stories, Abagnale responded that those people the journalists spoke to were too embarrassed to admit that they had been conned.</p><p>  洛根写道，揭穿辱骂的索赔的这些文章在他的崛起中没有超过一点点颠簸。在他的第一个外观后，被要求在多次回到“今晚的表演”。而且，当被问及新闻主张揭露他的故事时，Abagnale回答说，那些记者发言的人太尴尬了承认他们已经联系了。</p><p> Abagnale went on to write a best-selling book, which was then adapted into both the Spielberg film and a Broadway play. Those adaptations further legitimized Abagnale’s larger-than-life tales.</p><p> Abagnale继续写一本畅销书，然后改装成斯皮尔伯格薄膜和百老汇比赛。那些适应进一步合法化了Abagnale的大于生活的故事。</p><p> “When the movie comes out, you have major Hollywood players,” Logan said. “These are not … C-level actors. You’re talking about the elites, the most famous director of all time, with A-level Hollywood celebrities playing the roles. So think about how that would then translate. It’s got to be true because there’s no way it couldn’t be.”</p><p> “当电影出来时，你有好莱坞主要球员，”洛根说。 “这些不是... C级演员。你正在谈论精英，所有时间最着名的董事，有一个级别的好莱坞名人在扮演角色。所以想想那个怎么翻译。它必须是真的，因为它无法做到。“</p><p> Logan said Abagnale has even used the shield of the FBI to legitimize his story.</p><p> 洛根表示，Abagnale甚至用过FBI的盾牌来合法化他的故事。</p><p> “No one from the FBI has ever made a public statement about what Abagnale has or hasn’t done for them,” Logan said. “He has given some guest lectures at the academy, but he makes these outlandish statements in the media. He’s claimed to teach ethics at the FBI.”</p><p> “来自联邦调查局的没有人曾讨论过关于辱骂或者没有为他们做过的东西的公开陈述，”洛根说。 “他在学院举办了一些客座讲座，但他在媒体中制作了这些古怪的陈述。他声称在FBI教授道德。“</p><p>  “Go to YouTube, you will see the  Talks at Google that Abagnale did not that long ago. That video has been viewed over 11 million times. And he makes the claim there, still, that he was an attorney general and passed the bar exam.”</p><p>  “去YouTube，你会在谷歌看到谈判，这是很久以前的谈判。该视频已被浏览超过1100万次。他仍然在那里索赔，即他是一名律师，并通过了酒吧考试。“ </p><p> In the video, Abagnale claims that the FBI included in its  100th anniversary coffee table book a section that identifies him as the only person ever sprung out of the federal penitentiary to work for the agency.</p><p>在视频中，Abagnale声称，FBI包含在其100周年咖啡表中的一个部分，该节将他识别他，因为唯一的人涌出联邦监狱以获得原子能机构的工作。</p><p>  “And I just recently …  picked up a copy. There is, indeed, a beautiful coffee table book printed and  published by the FBI. And Mr. Abagnale’s name, as you might suspect, is nowhere to be found within it.”</p><p>  “我刚刚最近......拿起副本。确实有一本美丽的咖啡桌上由FBI打印和出版。和Abagnale先生的名字，正如你想象的那样，它无处可在其中找到。“</p><p> Logan said Abagnale’s story and his book are especially relevant now, encapsulating the problem of today’s “post-truth” society. A problem that is often exacerbated by social media.</p><p> 洛根说，阿比纳尔的故事和他的书现在特别相关，封装了今天“后真理”社会的问题。一个往往被社交媒体加剧的问题。</p><p> “You have seen ample evidence of the rapid speed at which misinformation is spread,” Logan said. “Especially when you see certain celebrities endorsing conspiracy theories, then you [begin] to see legitimacy and information spreads even farther, relying on what feels true as opposed to things that are verifiable. … [It] makes it harder to understand where the truth sits.”</p><p> “你已经看到了充分的证据证明了误导的快速速度，”洛根说。 “特别是当你看到某些名人认可的阴谋理论时，你[开始]看看合法性和信息甚至更远，依赖于与可核实的东西相反的东西。 ...... [它]更难了解真相坐在哪里。“</p><p> This story holds a lesson for the times we live in, Logan said: People should try to practice reflective thinking; they shouldn’t just believe everything they hear, but should instead interrogate unlikely claims that may come their way.</p><p> 这个故事持有我们生活的时代的教训，洛根说：人们应该试图练习反思思维;他们不应该相信他们所听到的一切，而是应该审查可能是可能来的索赔。</p><p> “Because I think many people, when they step back from this story and really take a breath and really think it through, ‘Is it possible that all this happened according to the narrative?’ And, it’s just not, it’s not plausible,” he said. “And so reflective thinking is something, I think, that is of extreme value to society right now.”</p><p> “因为我想到很多人，当他们从这个故事退回时，真正呼吸并真正思考它，”这一切都可能根据叙述发生吗？“而且，它只是不是，这不是似品，”他说。 “如此反思思维是某种东西，我认为，现在对社会的极度值。”</p><p>  We reached out to Frank W. Abagnale Jr. for a comment on this story. He emailed back saying:  “I have not read the book, nor do I think it is worthy of a comment.”</p><p>  我们伸手去弗兰克W.Abagnale Jr.关于这个故事的评论。他通过电子邮件发送回来说：“我还没读这本书，也不认为它值得评论。” </p><p>  Go on an adventure into unexpected corners of the health and science world each week with award-winning host Maiken Scott.</p><p>每周在屡获殊荣的主持人Maiken Scott冒险冒险进入健康和科学世界的意想不到的角落。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://whyy.org/segments/the-greatest-hoax-on-earth/">https://whyy.org/segments/the-greatest-hoax-on-earth/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/新书/">#新书</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/contends/">#contends</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/abagnale/">#abagnale</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
