It’s no easy task: most rely on donations and volunteers to keep going, and prison systems often all have varying and often-changing rules.</p><p> 在整个美国，有大约三十名计划致力于建立监狱图书馆，并将书籍获取监禁群体。这并不容易任务：最依赖于捐赠和志愿者继续前进，监狱系统往往都有不同且经常变化的规则。</p><p> But the work these organizations are doing is vital. The majority of the people who are in prison are coming back into society, and they need to be able to reenter and thrive. Anyone in prison deserves to have access to entertainment and education. As activists fight for improving conditions in prisons and work to break down the prison industrial complex, getting books and education into prisons is a vital step.</p><p> 但这些组织正在做的工作是至关重要的。在监狱中的大多数人都会回到社会中，他们需要能够重新进入和茁壮成长。监狱中的任何人都应该获得娱乐和教育。随着活动家争取改善监狱的条件和努力打破监狱工业群，将书籍和教育转变为监狱是一个重要的步骤。</p><p>  “Prison libraries tend to be poorly stocked, and access limited,” says Vicki White, president of  Chicago Books to Women in Prison (CBWP), a nonprofit all-volunteer organization that distributes paperback books to incarcerated women and trans people. “I’ve seen schedules posted at a prison where access was something like half an hour once a month.”</p><p>  “监狱图书馆往往储蓄差，而且获取有限公司，芝加哥书籍总裁Vicki White说，妇女（CBWP）是一个非营利组织（CBWP），是一个非营利性的全志愿者组织，将平装书分销给被监禁的妇女和跨国人。 “我见过时间表发布在监狱里，一个人每月一次进入一半的时间。”</p><p> People who are incarcerated often lack the resources to buy books for themselves, and so these libraries are the only access they have to entertainment and education. Books-to-prison programs provide them books free of charge, books that then become theirs. And often, these books are then passed on to other readers, or become part of the prison libraries themselves.</p><p> 被监禁的人往往缺乏为自己购买书籍的资源，因此这些图书馆是他们唯一可以娱乐和教育的访问。书籍到监狱课程为他们提供书籍，书籍随后成为他们的书。通常，这些书籍随后将被传递给其他读者，或者成为监狱图书馆的一部分。</p><p> “It may feel like a little thing, to give books,” says Rebecca Ginsburg, director of the  Education Justice Project. “Yet, while we work on those bigger structural changes, we need to make sure that the people who are currently locked up behind bars have what they need to survive, and to grow, to develop, and thrive.”</p><p> “这可能会像一点东西一样，提供书籍，”教育司法项目主任Rebecca Ginsburg说。 “然而，虽然我们在那些更大的结构变化上工作时，我们需要确保目前被锁在栏后面的人员有他们需要生存的东西，并增长，发展和茁壮成长。” </p><p>  Prison libraries were inadequate already, and under the COVID-19 crisis, the situation has grown painful.  The Equal Justice Initiative writes that incarcerated people are infected by the coronavirus at a rate more than five times higher than the nation’s overall rate; that the death rate of inmates is higher than the national rate; and that as of January 7, 2021, more than 433,000 incarcerated people and staff had been infected and at latest 1,960 had died. These numbers are already astonishing, and they do not account for the fact that jails and prisons are only conducting limited testing.</p><p>监狱图书馆已经不足，并且在Covid-19危机下，情况已经增长了痛苦。平等的司法倡议写道，被监禁的人受到冠状病毒的速度超过了超过全国总体率的速度;囚犯的死亡率高于国家税率;而且截至2021年1月7日，超过433,000名监禁的人和员工被感染，最近的1,960人死亡。这些数字已经惊人，他们不考虑监狱和监狱只是进行有限的测试。</p><p>  As these numbers are paired with overcrowding and the general poor health that accompanies prison conditions, many prisons have taken steps to curtail the spread of COVID-19. This has meant the closure of prison libraries across the U.S. The number of books prisoners could keep in their cells was already limited, and now their access to libraries has been cut off. While many can still access legal information, most have been cut off completely from any other book access.</p><p>  随着这些数字与过度拥挤和伴随监狱条件的一般穷国，许多监狱都采取了措施来减少Covid-19的传播。这意味着在美国的监狱图书馆关闭。书籍囚犯的数量可以保持在他们的细胞中已经有限，现在他们对图书馆的访问被切断了。虽然许多人仍然可以访问法律信息，但大多数人都已经完全从任何其他书籍访问中脱离了。</p><p> “23/7 lockdowns have become prevalent,” shared White. CBWP has received many letters from prisoners begging for books as a result .* Brooke in Alabama wrote: “As you know, we are in a crisis and we are locked down for 23 hours a day in our cells. ANY kind of books would be greatly appreciated!” Cherie in Georgia wrote: “The books really help keep my mind bizzy. Right know it would be greatly appreciated we are on lockdown right now and we are only allowed out for an hour a day.” Karen in Florida added: “Right now your books are such a blessing to us. Our movements are restricted and we are spending most of our time in the dorm. We aren’t allowed to visit the library, so all donations are welcomed by us all.”</p><p> “23/7锁定已经普遍，”共享白色。 CBWP收到了来自囚犯的许多信件，乞讨书籍。*在阿拉巴马州的Brooke写道：“如您所知，我们在危机中，我们每天在细胞中锁定23小时。任何类型的书都会非常感激！“在格鲁吉亚的Cherie写道：“书本真的有助于保持我的思绪。正确知道它会非常感谢我们现在正在锁定，我们每天只允许一小时。“佛罗里达州的凯伦补充说：“现在你的书是对我们这样的祝福。我们的动作受到限制，我们在宿舍里度过了大部分时间。我们不被允许访问图书馆，所以所有的捐款都欢迎我们所有人。“</p><p> And yet CBWP, like so many other books-to-prison organizations, was cut off from its space for months, also for safety reasons. Even once they gained access in mid-September, it’s a small space, and so they could only have tiny groups come together — a maximum of four people, twice a week, for only two hours. They are behind on answering letters by roughly six months.</p><p> 然而，由于许多其他书籍到监狱组织，因此，出于安全原因，从其空间中被切断了几个月的空间。即使一旦他们在9月中旬获得了访问，它也是一个小空间，所以他们只能有小团体聚集在一起 - 最多四个人，每周两次，只有两个小时。他们落后于回答信，大约六个月。</p><p> “At exactly the time when books are more important than ever,” White shares, “during this pandemic in which some kind of escape through books is so needed, access is more limited than ever.”</p><p> “在这篇文章比以往任何时候都重要的时候，”白股“在这种大流行期间的时候，这是如此需要某种通过书籍的逃生，可以比以往任何时候都更加限制。”</p><p> The collection and distribution of books into prisons took a serious hit across the board when COVID-19 shut down the country starting last March. Between fears of the virus transmitting on surfaces such as book covers, and the inability to access volunteer headquarters, these book-to-prison organizations were shut down for months.</p><p> 当Covid-19在去年三月开始，当Covid-19关闭这个国家时，书籍的收集和分销在董事会中受到严重击中。在对病毒的恐惧之间在书籍封面上传播的病毒，以及无法访问志愿者总部，这些簿记组织被关闭了几个月。</p><p> Most of them have found new ways to function — but many of these new systems are just ways of putting the work once done by larger squads of volunteers, including new members or people just stopping in, onto the shoulders of a select, core group of hard-working, loyal volunteers.</p><p> 其中大多数都发现了新的功能 - 但是许多这些新系统只是将工作曾经由更大的志愿者完成的工作，包括新成员或仅仅停止进入的核心集团的肩膀勤劳，忠诚的志愿者。 </p><p> Chris Satterwhite is cofounder and an active volunteer of the  Prison Books Project, a nonprofit organization that sends books to prisoners across Florida, funded by its used bookstore,  Open Books.</p><p>Chris SatterWhite是Cofounder和监狱书籍项目的积极志愿者，这是一个非营利组织，一个非营利组织向佛罗里达州的囚犯发送书籍，由其使用的书店开放的书籍。</p><p> “COVID-19 probably put the project initially back around two to three months,” said Satterwhite. “The pandemic has hit in a period when we were at our best organizationally, and people have been generous to us over the past few months. But it has slowed our turnaround.”</p><p> “Covid-19可能让项目最初回到两到三个月后，”泰特白头说。 “大流行在我们在组织上的最佳组织时击中了一段时间，而且过去几个月的人对我们慷慨。但它已经放慢了我们的转变。“</p><p> The project once had two packing sessions each week, and they were often helped by big groups of external volunteers, including local students, Girl Scouts, and other people looking to get involved. Now, they’re limited to tiny groups of three, and are only using a small group of trusted volunteers to keep things safe.</p><p> 该项目每周都有两个包装课程，他们经常由外部志愿者组成，包括当地学生，女孩童子军等人们希望参与其中。现在，它们仅限于三个小组，只使用一小组可信赖的志愿者来保持安全。</p><p> DC Books to Prisons is a 21-year-old nonprofit that sends books to incarcerated folks in 34 states, plus DC residents in federal facilities. Like many of these organizations, they receive letters from prisoners requesting specific books, and do their best to fulfill those requests. But their model has been limited in the last year: they were forced to stop operations for a couple months when their headquarters were closed.</p><p> 直流书籍给监狱是一个21岁的非营利组织，将书籍送到34个州的被监禁的人员，加上联邦设施中的DC居民。与这些组织中的许多组织一样，他们从请求特定书籍的囚犯收到信件，并尽最大努力满足这些请求。但他们的模型在去年的有限情况是：当他们的总部关闭时，他们被迫停止运营了。</p><p> “We have distributed our book-sending processes across a small-number of long-term volunteers who send from home,” says Jackie Snow, a volunteer. Snow handles a lot of the African American fiction and nonfiction, and comics and manga. While DC Books to Prisons has been able to catch up to the letters they’ve received, she emphasizes that because each volunteer sends from their own limited collection, it can be difficult to match requests.</p><p> “我们在派出家中派遣的小型长期志愿者划分了我们的书籍发送流程，”志愿者，志愿者Jackie Snow说。雪处理了很多非洲裔美国小说和非小说，以及漫画和漫画。虽然DC书籍能够赶上他们收到的信件，但她强调，因为每个志愿者都从他们自己的有限收藏中发送，可能很难匹配请求。</p><p>  Even before the pandemic, getting books into prisons was hardly an easy process. The difficult and often unpredictable review processes, which vary widely between individual prisons, jails, and systems, made it very difficult to get books to prisoners.</p><p>  即使在大流行之前，将书籍进入监狱几乎是一个简单的过程。在个人监狱，监狱和系统之间差异很大的困难且经常不可预测的审查流程使得将书籍与囚犯获得非常困难。</p><p> Prison officials are allowed to censor or ban reading material that would threaten security in the prison, by inciting violence, for example. But these bans are often biased in ways that organizers find troubling.</p><p> 例如，允许监狱官员通过煽动暴力，审查或禁止在监狱中威胁安全的阅读材料。但这些禁令常常以组织者发现令人不安的方式偏见。 </p><p> For example, volunteer Snow is consistently frustrated by blanket bans around urban novels. The claim is that any fiction centering gangs or violent crimes could encourage violence in the prison — but in application, these rules tend to be charged with racist and socioeconomic bias.</p><p>例如，志愿雪一直受到城市小说中的毯子禁令的挫败感。索赔是，任何小说宗心或暴力犯罪都可以鼓励监狱的暴力行为 - 但在申请中，这些规则往往被指控种族主义和社会经济偏见。</p><p> “These are usually books by and about Black Americans in cities, that may involve gangs, drug dealing, or some level of violence,” she says. “But while those are rejected, books like  The Godfather don’t even raise an eyebrow.” Snow is constantly looking for books by Black writers that might allow urban people of color to see themselves depicted, but that won’t be flagged in the review process.</p><p> “这些通常是关于城市的黑人美国人的书籍，可能涉及帮派，药物处理或某种程度的暴力，”她说。 “但是那些被拒绝的人，像教父一样的书籍甚至没有抬起眉毛。”雪是不断寻找黑色作家的书籍，这些书可能允许城市人们所描绘的颜色，但在审查过程中不会被标记。</p><p>  Books, fiction or nonfiction, that focus on subjects such as slavery, race, racism, and lynching are frequently likely to be banned while other texts are allowed.  Wisconsin, for example, bans Ralph Ginzburg’s  100 Years of Lynching but allows  Mein Kampf . Books are often banned because they could “incite violence,” but crime and legal thrillers that contain violence often enter the prison without being flagged. Meanwhile,  the Equal Justice Initiative lists  Just Mercy by Bryan Stevenson,  Kindred by Octavia Butler, and  Slavery by Another Name by Douglas Blackman as just some of the books that have been banned by prisons.</p><p>  在允许的其他文本时，往往可能被禁止禁止奴隶制，种族，种族主义等主题的书籍，小说或非小说。例如，威斯康星州禁止禁止林茨堡的100年，但允许Mein Kampf。书籍经常被禁止，因为他们可以“煽动暴力”，而是遏制暴力的犯罪和法律惊悚恐慌通常在没有被标记的情况下进入监狱。与此同时，平等的司法倡议列出了布莱恩斯特史蒂文森的怜悯，由Octavia Butler和Douglas Blackman的另一个名字的奴隶制只是监狱被禁止的一些书籍。</p><p> While it’s terrible to see books become banned — particularly as the decision can be relatively permanent — there is one sliver of a silver lining to strict “banned books” lists, in that they at least allow for clear guidelines. Too often, prisons and jails use strange and arbitrary restrictions that change often and are difficult to follow, resulting in entire boxes of materials being rejected for small or unexpected reasons.</p><p> 虽然看书是可怕的禁止的虽然决定可以比较永久 - 但是，有一个银衬里的一个狭窄的银色衬里，严格“被禁止的书籍”名单，因为它们至少允许明确的指导。经常，监狱和监狱使用奇怪和任意的限制，经常改变，难以遵循，导致整个材料框被拒绝以少或意想不到的原因。</p><p> Open Books has experienced a couple unexpected challenges, and luckily have been able to challenge almost all of those cases in order to get the books into prisons. But nevertheless, the reasons for rejection are often mystifying and frustrating. An American Sign Language book was rejected, and at another point, a Dutch-English dictionary.</p><p> 开放书籍经历了一些意想不到的挑战，幸运的是，几乎所有这些案件都能够挑战，以便将书籍纳入监狱。但然而，拒绝的原因往往是神秘和令人沮丧的。美国手语簿被拒绝，另一点，荷兰语 - 英语词典。</p><p> “Really, it just seems at the whim of whoever happens to be getting the mail that day,” says Satterwhite. “For the most part, what we’ve experienced is there’s almost no rhyme or reason for what gets banned and what gets censored.”</p><p> “真的，似乎当天曾经掌握邮件的人似乎有兴趣，”Satterwhite说。 “在大多数情况下，我们经历过的是几乎没有押韵或被禁止的原因以及被审查的内容。”</p><p> The Prison Book Project recently published  Things to Do While You’re Waiting by Bob Gerold , a book providing resources and advice for prisoners preparing to reenter society. But it was rejected. It gave advice for how to start a business — an appealing option for incarcerated people, who can often lack SSN cards and other ID, and who can struggle to find viable work options with their history and lack of experience. But a prison said that because prisoners weren’t allowed to start businesses while still in prison, they couldn’t allow the book. Satterwhite says they plan to print a new version that stipulates it’s just advice, but was frustrated at the result.</p><p> 监狱书项目最近在鲍勃Gerold等待鲍勃Gerold等待的时候发表了良好的事情，为囚犯提供准备重新进入社会的囚犯。但它被拒绝了。它给出了如何启动企业的建议 - 被监禁的人的吸引人的选择，他们通常可以缺乏SSN卡和其他身份证，并且谁可以努力寻找与他们的历史和缺乏经验的可行工作选择。但是，一名监狱说，因为囚犯在仍然在监狱时不允许开始企业，但他们不能允许这本书。 Satterwhite表示，他们计划打印一个新版本，规定它只是建议，但对结果感到沮丧。 </p><p> Before Snow sends in her books, she has another volunteer do quality assurance — anything from water stains to a forgotten bookmark could get a book flagged, and often if one book is flagged, the entire package will be rejected. Organizations have to dedicate much of their time simply to keep up with shifting regulations, which vary from prison to prison and can change on a dime. Some states have made the process itself so difficult that DC Books to Prisons can’t send to prisoners in those states.</p><p>在雪地发送之前，她有另一位志愿者做质量保证 - 从水渍到遗忘书签的任何东西都可以获得一本书标记，而且经常被标记一本书，整个包装将被拒绝。组织必须奉献大部分时间，只需跟上转移法规，这些规定因监狱而异，可以改变一毛钱。有些国家使这个过程本身很难将直流书籍与监狱的书籍无法发送给这些国家的囚犯。</p><p>  Jeanie Austin, the author of   Library services and incarceration: Recognizing barriers, strengthening access (ALA, Summer 2021), added: “Librarians experience a real range of difficulties bringing in books from the public library side — no writing, watermarks, anything.” One group was told that they now can’t send books wrapped in anything but white paper. Meanwhile, communication can be severely lacking when rules change, sometimes coming only after the first rejections have come through. It makes these rules difficult to follow. “Those regulations become part of a librarian’s job,” they said.</p><p>  Jeanie Austin，图书馆服务和监禁的作者：识别障碍，加强访问（ALA，夏季2021年），补充说：“图书馆员体验着一个真正的困难，从公共图书馆方面带来书籍 - 没有写作，水印，任何东西。”被告知他们现在不能派书籍包裹的书，除了白皮书。同时，当规则发生变化时，可以严重缺乏通信，有时只在第一次拒绝后来。它使这些规则难以追随。 “这些法规成为图书管理员工作的一部分，”他们说。</p><p> “The target is constantly moving, and we’re constantly trying to keep up with it,” Snow shared. The rules can be more particular than we might anticipate. Prisons don’t allow any nudity, which probably makes sense in theory to many readers. But this rule has been applied to everything from   Trans Bodies, Trans Selves edited by Laura Erickson-Schroth, to medical dictionaries, to art books depicting “The Birth of Venus.” DC Books to Prisons once saw a book rejected due to a naked baby Jesus.</p><p> “目标不断迁移，我们不断努力跟上它，”雪共享。规则可以比我们预期更特别。监狱不允许任何裸体，这可能理论上对许多读者都有意义。但这条规则已经应用于来自跨机构，劳拉·埃里克森 - 谢罗斯编辑的跨境，向医学词典编辑的一切，描绘了“金星的诞生”。直流书籍给监狱曾经看到一本书由于赤裸裸的婴儿耶稣而被拒绝。</p><p> “Sometimes the process feels a little broken,” says Ginsburg. Her organization depends on its partners to facilitate their delivery of instructional materials such as books and DVDs. “I understand that they’re trying to fix it. A more transparent process with a clear appeals process that has integrity will facilitate the delivery of materials and the access and a distribution of materials within the prison.”</p><p> “有时这个过程感觉有点破碎，”吉斯堡说。她的组织取决于其合作伙伴，以方便他们提供书籍和DVD等教学材料。 “我明白他们试图解决它。一个更透明的过程，具有明确的上诉过程，诚信将有助于提供材料和进入和监狱内材料的分配。“</p><p>  Rebecca Ginsburg is an associate professor of education policy, organization, and leadership at the University of Illinois, and the director of the  Education Justice Project, a comprehensive college-in-prison program that provides academic programs to incarcerated individuals. They have about 75 students any given semester, but the books and materials are often shared throughout the prison. The books help to form a formidable prison library, which is vital, as the waiting list to get into the ABE and GED programs is often made up of hundreds of people.</p><p>  Rebecca Ginsburg是伊利诺伊大学的教育政策，组织和领导副教授，教育司法项目主任，一个全面的监狱计划，为被监禁的个人提供学术课程。他们拥有大约75名学生的学生，但书籍和材料经常在整个监狱中分享。书籍有助于形成一个强大的监狱图书馆，这是至关重要的，因为进入安倍和GED计划的候补名单通常由数百人组成。</p><p> In 2019, without warning,  prison administrators raided EJP’s library and took out over 200 titles, most of which were concerned with African American history and culture, civil rights, and slavery, as well as some LGBTQ titles and some titles for children of incarcerated parents. EJP only found out when their students told them what had happened. They were forced to fight for months and eventually get the Illinois legislature involved to return the books to the shelves.</p><p> 2019年，没有警告，监狱管理员袭击了EJP的图书馆，并拿出了200多个冠军，其中大部分涉及非洲裔美国历史和文化，民权和奴隶制，以及一些LGBTQ冠军以及被监禁父母的儿童的一些冠军。 EJP只发现他们的学生告诉他们发生了什么事。他们被迫争夺几个月，最终得到伊利诺伊州立法机构，以将书籍退回货架。</p><p> Freedom to Learn was a campaign that rose out of that incident. This campaign goes beyond battling book banning, destruction, and censorship, to fight for something greater.</p><p> 学习的自由是一个竞争中崛起的竞选活动。这项运动超出了禁止作战的书，毁灭和审查，为更大的东西而战。 </p><p> “We advocate for better conditions for our programs and our students. We’re going to go further and bring other issues up,” said Ginsburg. These issues include transfer holds — making it so that a prisoner in the midst of a program to get their degree cannot be suddenly transferred to a different prison — as well as the ability for students to keep their education materials in their own rooms.</p><p>“我们倡导为我们的计划和学生提供更好的条件。我们将进一步进一步并带来其他问题，“吉斯堡说。这些问题包括转移持有 - 使其成为一个计划中间的囚犯无法突然转移到不同的监狱 - 以及学生在自己的房间里保留他们的教育材料的能力。</p><p> “Long before we had texts, we had people curious about the world,” Ginsburg added. “That’s not something I would want to deprive anybody of simply because they are in prison.” It’s vital that people fight to allow prisoners to have a wide selection of books, through books-to-prisoners programs and through robust prison libraries.</p><p> “在我们有文本之前，我们有很多关于这个世界的人，”吉斯堡补充道。 “那不是我想要剥夺任何人的东西，因为他们在监狱里。”人们努力使囚犯通过书籍，通过书籍囚犯计划以及通过强大的监狱图书馆来努力允许囚犯努力。</p><p> “People in prison want to learn, want to create beauty,” says Vicki White. She says that some of their biggest requests are for books on dancing or on arts and crafts such as cross-stitch, drawing, and crochet, as well as puzzle books.</p><p> “监狱里的人想学习，想创造美丽，”Vicki White说。她说，他们的一些最大的请求是跳舞的书籍或艺术和工艺品，如十字绣，绘图和钩针，以及拼图书籍。</p><p> Satterwhite’s top requested materials include dictionaries, Black history books, urban novels, and Spanish-English dictionaries.</p><p> Satterwhite的最高要求材料包括词典，黑色历史书籍，城市小说和西班牙语 - 英语词典。</p><p> We recently sent a dictionary in response to this letter: &#34;I decided to make use of my time in prison by writing 2 fiction books… This is what I need from you guys (if you can). I need a  @MerriamWebster dictionary and a thesaurus to aid me in writing these books.&#34;</p><p> 我们最近发送了一封文字的字典：＆＃34;我决定通过写作2个小说书籍来利用我的时间在监狱中......这就是我所需要的人（如果可以）。我需要一个@merriamwebster字典和一位词库来帮助我写这些书籍。＆＃34;</p><p>— DC Books to Prisons (@B2Pdc)  March 1, 2021</p><p> - 直流书籍给监狱（@ B2PDC）2021年3月1日</p><p> “Our biggest request outside of dictionaries are sci-fi books,” says Satterwhite. “They just want to get as far away as they can. It’s a mental escape, to help save their sanity.” Snow adds that some of DC Books to Prison’s most popular areas include comics, westerns, and thrillers.</p><p> “我们在词典之外的最大要求是科幻书籍，”Satterwhite说。 “他们只是想尽可能远的地方。这是一个精神逃脱，以帮助挽救他们的理智。“雪补充说，一些DC书籍到监狱最受欢迎的地区包括漫画，西部和惊悚片。 </p><p> People like to stay connected with their religion and spirituality in prison, and will also request books that will help them understand their health, nutrition, and exercise — or even medications, as they’re often not given detailed information on what they’re taking. People’s interests range far and wide, and the Prison Book Project has also had requests for things like nuclear physics. Books can help root prisoners who may feel lost due to language or cultural differences. They can keep people calm, be an opportunity to write and create. They can provide a topic of discussion with fellow prisoners, friends, and family.</p><p>人们喜欢与他们的宗教和灵性保持联系，也将要求有助于他们了解他们的健康，营养和运动 - 甚至药物的书籍，因为它们往往没有获得他们所采取的详细信息。人们的利益范围远远宽，监狱书项目也有要求核物理物理物品。书籍可以帮助植物囚犯因语言或文化差异而感到遗失。他们可以让人们保持冷静，有机会写作和创造。他们可以提供与同胞，朋友和家人的讨论主题。</p><p> In other words, people in prison are just like people not in prison: they have a wide range of interests, and have many different, equally valid reasons for wanting to read.</p><p> 换句话说，监狱里的人就像没有监狱的人一样：他们拥有广泛的兴趣，并且有许多不同的，同样有效的原因想要阅读。</p><p> “I think it’s important to make books available to anybody who wants books,” says Ginsburg. “People who live in prisons aren’t exempt from the human urge to read, learn, grow, and develop. We all benefit when as many people as wish to have access to information and knowledge do have that access.”</p><p> “我认为为想要书籍的人提供书籍是很重要的，”吉斯堡说。 “居住在监狱的人不豁免读，学习，成长和发展的人类敦促。当许多人希望获得信息和知识时，我们都受益，确实有这种访问。“</p><p> “I think that a lot of people who are readers can probably think of a book or two that radically changed the direction of their lives,” says Satterwhite. “We’re hoping that we can be a project that sends that book to somebody that has that impact.”</p><p> “我认为很多读者的人可能会想到一本书或两者，从根本上改变了他们的生活方向，”误事机说道。 “我们希望我们能成为一个将那本书发送给那种影响的人的项目。”</p><p>  Lisa Krolak is Chief Librarian of the  UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning in Germany and the author of   Books beyond Bars: The transformative potential of prison libraries . Krolak hears different things from around the world about the role of books and reading in prison, and has worked to lecture and share her views about how to improve opportunities for the incarcerated around the world. She says that one of the most important things that books give prisoners is autonomy. “Life in prison is so structured,” says Krolak. “You are told what to do all the time. Using a prison library is one of the few opportunities where the prisoners can choose their own materials.”</p><p>  Lisa Krolak是德国教科文组织终身学习研究所的首席图书管理员，以及超越酒吧的书籍作者：监狱图书馆的变革性潜力。 Krolak在世界各地听到了关于书籍和阅读中的角色的不同东西，并致力于讲座，分享她关于如何改善世界各地监禁机会的看法。她说，书籍给囚犯是自治的最重要的事情之一。 “监狱里的生活是如此结构化，”克罗拉克说。 “你被告知所有时间要做什么。使用监狱图书馆是囚犯可以选择自己材料的少数机会之一。“</p><p>  “Having a prison library is a chance for the prisoners to experience lifelong learning,” says Krolak. “A community space that they might not have experienced outside, but that they can get to know inside, and then use once they leave.” Prison librarians should be equipped for this, and should be trained to run such a space.</p><p>  “拥有监狱图书馆是囚犯体验终身学习的机会，”Krolak说。 “他们可能没有在外面经历的社区空间，但他们可以了解内部，然后在他们离开后使用。”监狱图书馆员应该配备这一点，应该训练以运行这样的空间。</p><p> Unfortunately, they often do not have the budget, time, permissions, or training to do so. Prison librarians are often isolated professionally from public librarians. They aren’t always trained to run a library. Sometimes, they’re prison guards doubling up as librarians, juggling it among many other tasks, or incarcerated people themselves.</p><p> 不幸的是，他们常常没有预算，时间，权限或培训。监狱图书馆员经常从公共图书馆员专业孤立。他们并不总是培训来运行图书馆。有时候，他们是监狱守卫将其作为图书馆员加倍，在许多其他任务中杂耍，或者被监禁的人自己。 </p><p> “Prison librarians are under some of the same kind of technological restrictions that people who are incarcerated are under,” explains Austin, “and sometimes they’re performing three different jobs when they’re one person, serving hundreds of people. They’re handling leisure reading, law library, reference.” That pressure has only increased during the pandemic, as some prison librarians have taken paper requests for materials and literally had to photocopy them and bring stacks of photocopies to the units.</p><p>“监狱图书馆员受到了被监禁的人的一些相同的技术限制，”奥斯汀解释“，有时他们在一个人服务的人时，他们正在执行三个不同的工作。他们正在处理休闲阅读，法律图书馆，参考。“这一压力在大流行期间只有增加，因为一些监狱图书馆员已经拍了纸质材料，并且字面意思是必须复印并将堆栈的复印机带到单位。</p><p> Most prisons don’t have a specific budget for their libraries. “That means that libraries are vying for funds coming from the commissary sales side,” said Austin. “It’s an exploitative system where the librarians are positioned in this dynamic of taxing people who are making 26 cents an hour in order to buy library books.” Ideally, a federal mandate could obligate prison systems to fund recreational reading, but in its place, access to the public library and its resources could be tremendous.</p><p> 大多数监狱没有他们的图书馆的特定预算。 “这意味着图书馆正在争夺来自委员会销售方面的资金，”奥斯汀说。 “这是一个剥削制度，其中图书馆员定位在这种征税的动态，征税每小时制作26美分以购买图书馆书籍。”理想情况下，联邦授权可以迫使监狱系统为娱乐阅读提供资金，但在其位置，访问公共图书馆及其资源可能是巨大的。</p><p> Already, public libraries have programs where they are trying to help: supporting books-to-prisoners groups, doing programs around mass incarceration, forming partnerships with nearby jails and prisons, forming interlibrary loan programs between public and prison libraries. Austin also mentions robust reference-by-mail programs, where public librarians answer reference questions from people inside through the mail.</p><p> 已经，公共图书馆有他们试图提供帮助的计划：支持书籍到囚犯群体，在大规模监禁方面进行课程，与附近的监狱和监狱进行伙伴关系，在公共和监狱图书馆之间形成界限贷款计划。奥斯汀还提到了强大的备用邮件程序，其中公共图书管理员通过邮件中的人们回答参考问题。</p><p> In coordination with other librarians, Austin has been identifying library systems answering mail from incarcerated populations, and encouraging new library systems to do so — actively building out a network. Austin and New York Public Library’s Correctional Services librarians support libraries in initiating this kind of work.</p><p> 在与其他图书馆员的协调中，奥斯汀一直在识别库系统从监禁群体回答邮件，并鼓励新图书馆系统进行局面建立网络。奥斯汀和纽约公共图书馆的惩教服务图书馆员支持在启动这种工作时支持图书馆。</p><p> “We’re trying to ease the transition as much as possible,” Austin says, “because we know that many libraries are already receiving letters from people inside, but they might not get answered, because librarians don’t know what’s okay to send them and what isn’t.” Their dream is that every state and area has a library doing this work. “There are definitely states where it’s not happening,” they said, “but there are people </p><p> “我们正试图尽可能地缓解过渡，”奥斯汀说：“因为我们知道许多图书馆已经从里面的人收到了这些文字，但他们可能没有得到回答，因为图书馆员不知道什么可以发送什么他们和什么不是。“他们的梦想是，每个州和地区都有一个在做这项工作的图书馆。 “肯定是它没有发生的地方，”他们说，“但有人</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://bookriot.com/books-in-prisons/">https://bookriot.com/books-in-prisons/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/书籍/">#书籍</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/获取/">#获取</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
