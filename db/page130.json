A price for the acquisition wasn\u2019t disclosed but people familiar with the transaction said it was about $1 billion.\n  JPMorgan said in January it would  launch a new digital bank in the U.K., offering consumer banking services there for the first time. Called Chase, it is currently being tested internally with JPMorgan employees ahead of a public launch later this year.\n  Nutmeg\u2019s savings and investment products won\u2019t initially be offered through the retail banking project, the bank said.\n      JPMorgan is entering a crowded digital banking marketplace in the U.K. Regulators encouraged new startups, including Starling Bank Ltd. and Monzo Bank Ltd., to boost competition in the wake of the last global financial crisis. These so-called challenger banks have forced traditional lenders to improve their digital offerings but have struggled to earn profits.\n  JPMorgan last year considered making a bid for Starling Bank, founded by Anne Boden in 2014, according to people familiar with the situation.\n  JPMorgan previously tried to launch a digital bank in U.S. cities and markets where it didn\u2019t have Chase branches, but closed the product, called Finn, in June 2019 after slow pickup. Bank executives have said they learned lessons from that program, including that the Chase brand resonated better than a new name.\n  Nutmeg aims to make wealth management more accessible through the internet, Neil Alexander, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. Nutmeg was chosen as a name because the spice, like wealth and investment services, was once rare and costly but is now widely available.\n  Like other investment sites, it sells access to funds, ETFs and pensions. Nutmeg appeals to investment novices, avoids jargon and provides tools and Q&amp;As about the ins and outs of the finance world.\n  The company\u2019s revenue grew 29% in 2019 to \u00a39.3 million from the previous year, and its loss increased 15% to \u00a321.2 million. Its shareholders, who will be bought out in the deal, include  Goldman Sachs Group  and  Schroders PLC, the U.K. asset manager.\n  Appeared in the June 18, 2021, print edition as &#39;JPMorgan Buys Nutmeg in U.K. Digital Push.&#39;", "posttime": "2021-06-18 09:39:48", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4ea4\u6613,\u7ba1\u7406,deal,\u94f6\u884c", "title": "JPMORGAN\u8d2d\u4e70\u82f1\u56fd\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u8d22\u5bcc\u7ecf\u7406\u8089\u8c46\u853b\uff0c\u62e5\u6709140k +\u5ba2\u6237\uff0c\u7ba1\u7406\u8d44\u4ea7\u7ea6\u4e3a5\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143;

Brand safety has been a real concern for advertisers and their clients for the last few years. It\u2019s been top of mind as more search marketers are finding their ad content served up next to negative, fake, and downright spammy sites. Google\u2019s own 2020 Ad Safety Report focused on sensitivity \u201cto brands\u2019 need for control over where their ads displayed as there were increases in hate speech and calls to violence online,\u201d  we wrote earlier this year. But this new data indicates that unless advertisers are paying careful attention to their  exclusion lists, there\u2019s a chance that they could be showing up next to fake news and misleading content online.\n       Carolyn Lyden serves as the Director of Search Content for Search Engine Land and SMX.

"note_en": "Futures for July delivery ended Tuesday at $1,009.90 per thousand board feet, down 41% from the record of $1,711.20 reached in early May. Futures have declined 14 of the past 16 trading days.\n  Cash lumber prices are also crashing. Pricing service Random Lengths said Friday that its framing composite index, which tracks on-the-spot sales, dropped $122 to $1,324, its biggest ever weekly decline. The pullback came just six weeks after the index rose $124 during the first week of May, its most on record. Random Lengths described a chaotic rout in which sawmill managers struggled to provide customers with price quotes. It said late Tuesday that its index had dropped another $114, to $1,210.\n  Economists and investors have wondered if sky-high prices for wood products would doom  the booming housing market. Builders raised home prices and many stopped selling houses before the studs were installed, lest they misjudge costs and sell too cheaply. Lumber became central to  the inflation debate: whether a period of runaway inflation was afoot or high prices were temporary shocks that would ease as the economy moved further from lockdown.\n    The rapid decline suggests a bubble that has burst and the question is how low lumber prices will fall. Even after tumbling, lumber futures remain nearly three times what is typical for this time of year. Lumber producers and traders expect that prices will remain relatively high due to the strong housing market, but that the supply bottlenecks and frenzied buying that characterized the economy\u2019s reopening and sent prices to multiples of the old all-time highs are winding down.\n      During the run-up, wood was hoarded by builders, retailers and others worried about running out of material during a construction season set into overdrive by low mortgage rates and federal stimulus payments.\n  \u201cEveryone was buying more than they needed,\u201d said Mike Wisnefski, a former lumber trader and chief executive of online marketplace MaterialsXchange. \u201cThere was this fear of lack of availability.\u201d\n  Now the market is being flooded by what Mr. Wisnefski calls shadow inventory as businesses that are normally big buyers, such as home builders and companies that prefabricate the trusses that hold up roofs and floors, sell from their own stockpiles.\n    Lumber producers say that prices should remain relatively high as home builders try to erase the country\u2019s deficit of housing. Mortgage-finance firm Freddie Mac estimated in April that the U.S.  is about 3.8 million houses shy of meeting demand, thanks largely to the lack of construction following the 2008 housing crash.\n  \u201cI don\u2019t think $1,000 lumber prices are the new normal,\u201d Devin Stockfish, chief executive of lumber producer  Weyerhaeuser    WY  -0.99%  , told investors at a conference last week. \u201cBut that being said, when you think about the amount of housing that we\u2019re going to have to build in the U.S. over the next three, five, 10 years, that\u2019s just a significant amount of demand for wood products.\u201d\n  At the same conference, executives from lumber producer  PotlatchDeltic    PCH  -0.40%  said they expect lumber to trade in a range of $700 to $800 through next year. That is still more than the pre-pandemic record of $639 and is based on their estimation of the price that mills in British Columbia need to break even sawing North America\u2019s most-expensive logs. Prices below that could prompt mills in Canada to dial back output or shut down, which would eventually force prices higher to meet demand, they said.\n    The stock market is assuming even lower lumber prices ahead. Analysts with BMO Capital Markets recently calculated that the share prices of three Canadian firms that have become  the biggest sawyers in the southern pinelands have priced in expectations of $447 lumber next year. That would be a little more expensive than normal, but more in line with historical prices.\n  Those firms\u2014  Interfor    IFP  -3.35%  ,  Canfor    CFPZF  -2.97%  and  West Fraser Timber    WFG  -3.18%  \u2014along with U.S. rivals Weyerhaeuser and PotlatchDeltic  have notched record profits since ramping up mills to meet an  unexpected rush of demand last summer.\n  Sawmill owners have had some of the best performing stocks of the pandemic, though all five lumber producers are down at least 9.5% over the past month.\n  A flurry of stock sales by forest-products executives last quarter suggests that those at the top of these firms believe peak lumber is in the rearview, said Ben Silverman, director of research at InsiderScore, which tracks executive stock sales and purchases.\n  What impact has the price of lumber had on your home construction or renovation project? Join the conversation below.\n  Executives at Weyerhaeuser sold $14.6 million worth of company shares last quarter, the most since the third quarter of 2016, according to InsiderScore. PotlatchDeltic executives sold $12.1 million during that time, the most since InsiderScore began keeping track in 2003. Timberland owner  Rayonier    RYN  -0.99%  also disclosed the heaviest selling by insiders in more than a decade. Rayonier doesn\u2019t own any sawmills but holds timberland in New Zealand and the Pacific Northwest, where log prices have risen along with those of lumber. Spokesmen for Weyerhaeuser and Rayonier declined to comment. Representatives for PotlatchDeltic didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n  \u201cThis level of selling is simply unusual and to have this type of alignment among peers like this is unusual,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cIt shows a consensus within the group about how they are thinking about their stock prices.\u201d\n  Appeared in the June 16, 2021, print edition as

lot has been written about the six-pager and PR/FAQ so I\u2019m not going focus on document formats, but I wanted to share how our process benefits from document-based meetings.I also have identified some areas for improvement if you are looking to adopt document-based meetings for your workplace.\n I\u2019ve been wanting to write this blog post for a while and Jaana\u2019s tweet finally gave me the inspiration to share my thoughts.\n Meetings starting with silent document reading is the best idea ever. I have no idea why this isn&#39;t common practice in the industry.\n\u2014 Jaana Dogan \u30e4\u30ca \u30c9\u30ac\u30f3 (@rakyll)  March 10, 2021\n My role is a Sr. Developer Advocate within AWS Container Services so my experience may be different from other areas and roles at Amazon.A majority of my meetings start with reading a document.This takes \u201cthis meeting could have been\u2026\u201d and flips it upside down.Most of the time, if there isn\u2019t a doc there isn\u2019t a meeting.\n Depending on the meeting, the document could be a six-pager, a PR/FAQ, a one-pager about an idea, a narrative to help find a solution to a problem, or even a service review full of charts, graphs and bullet points.The document adapts to fit the audience and purpose of the meeting.\n Reading documents is so ingrained in our culture and process that our scheduling tools have check boxes to automatically create a document.If I\u2019m catching up on a new service or feature launch, I will find the document rather than emailing or calling the product manager.\n The interesting part to me isn\u2019t in the format of the document, but how it is used.Meetings start with reading.Depending on the length of the document, we\u2019ll read anywhere from ten minutes to half an hour.If the meeting has a long document (six-pagers are the longest) and many attendees, the meeting will be scheduled for enough time to read and discuss.\n Reading the doc is part of the scheduled time.I\u2019ve worked at plenty of places that I\u2019ve tried to document everything for a meeting ahead of time.I\u2019ve written well thought-out emails, shared links to documents, and written detailed wiki pages.In all of my meetings outside of Amazon I had one of three outcomes:* No one read the email/document and I had to explain everything in the meeting* Some people read the document but forgot what it said because they read it days or hours before* At least one person had a question that I could have answered via email\n Before I started at Amazon these were some of the expected benefits to reading in meetings.* All of the information for the meeting is contained in the doc* People are not expected to find their own time to read* The document is fresh in everyone\u2019s mind\n Some other benefits I\u2019ve found while putting it in practice are:* Presenters, including myself, don\u2019t have to feel nervous about presenting in front of people.* Documents help eliminate many biases, for or against, the person who wrote the document.* You read everything in your own voice and vocal communication barriers such as accents, vocal ticks, or handicaps (e.g. stuttering or hearing loss) are not present in the document.* There\u2019s no \u201ccan you see my screen\u201d, background noise, or call audio disconnects while understanding the main content for the meeting.* There\u2019s a wealth of current and past documents. Want to see what the PR/FAQ looked like for Amazon EKS or AWS Lambda? It exists.* You are not expected to retain document information outside of the meeting. Feedback and discussions happen during the meeting. Comments can be answered asynchronously. If more discussion is needed then the document will be revised and a new meeting will be scheduled to read and discuss it.* If a document is provided early and I have a conflict at the begining of the meeting I can read the document ahead of time and join the meeting 10-20 minutes late without missing anything.* Document reading from home has been a great way to get 10-20 minutes of exercise in.\n Reading docs at the beginning of meetings is a great way to squeeze in some exercise!  I&#39;m trying to make this a new habit. Even a 10 minute climb is enough to get my heart rate up.  Pay no attention to the cables \ud83d\ude48  pic.twitter.com/zyCbUczZAA\n\u2014 Justin Garrison (@rothgar)  January 15, 2021\n There are some limitations to document based meetings.The first I have noticed is if you\u2019re not a very good writer you will be at a disadvantage communicating your ideas.Amazon has a lot of internal training to help you write good Amazon documents, but even with training it still requires a good foundation.I\u2019m very thankful for my years of practice writing for  How-To Geek and   Cloud Native Infrastructure.Even with that background, my first one-pager review was intimidating.\n I\u2019ve been told \u201cif there\u2019s no document, it doesn\u2019t get done.\u201dThis includes meetings.If there\u2019s no document, we cancel the meeting.\n While documents can create a more level playing field it\u2019s also a high barrier to entry.Even for small ideas, features, or iterations the first thing you will likely need is a document.My perspective may be skewed because in my current role I don\u2019t write production service code, but I do affect features, design, and positioning of the services.I have a lot of feedback and ideas, but I don\u2019t implement them.\n The available wealth of historical documents can be enlightening to read through, but it also can be confusing to trace the lineage of a service with a plethora of documents and comments.I have caught myself more than once reading a document which I thought sounded similar to an existing service only to realize 20 minutes later the document  is for the service and I didn\u2019t look at the date of the document or I didn\u2019t know the product code name.\n I have the benefit of working with the service teams and providing direct feedback about new features and services.Most documents I read are very interesting.Many teams at Amazon don\u2019t have direct product input.However, they\u2019re still required to write documents to communicate plans with their team.Not all docs are interesting, but they are crucial to the decision making process.\n I\u2019ve said multiple times that Amazon has the foundation for a great remote-first company.The document-based process provides employees in multiple timezones the same context as someone in Seattle.The discussions in meetings enable faster feedback loops, but the downside is they can limit the potential for asynchronous engagements if notes and questions aren\u2019t captured in the document.\n I\u2019ve never had the benefit of attending an Amazon meeting in person.From what I\u2019ve heard document-centered meetings have been extremely successful in transitioning to remote requirements.But the content isn\u2019t the only thing that matters.\n Amazon, like many large organizations, uses a lot of tools to communicate.It\u2019s often difficult to find documents spread across so many tools without an ability to cross search or centrally organize them.I could see how a tool like  Command E could help a lot.This can be additionally difficult with the multitude of open source and social platforms I engage with on a weekly basis.I currently have a user in 53 Slack workspaces. \ud83d\udc80\n Even with areas that could use improvement I can\u2019t think of a place I have worked that wouldn\u2019t benefit from document-based meetings.I\u2019m sure with more practice I will get better at writing with a more Amazonian style.\n I thoroughly enjoy not having to prep for meetings, because I\u2019m confident the document will give me the context I need to participate.I know the person who called the meeting invested their time so they don\u2019t waste mine.I reciprocate the same thoughtfulness with meetings I create and documents I write.", "posttime": "2021-06-18

", "note_en": "Unfortunately, many comments are not particularly helpful. The most common reason is that comments repeat the code: all of the information in the comment can easily be deduced from the code next to the comment.\n  // Add a horizontal scroll barhScrollBar = new JScrollBar(scrollBar, HORIZONTAL);add(hScrollBar, BorderLayout.SOUTH);// Add a vertical scroll barvScrollBar = new JScrollBar(JScrollBar.VERTICAL);add(vScrollBar, BorderLayout.EAST);// Initialize the caret-position related valuescaretX = 0;caretY = 0;caretMemX = null;\n The argument against comments like these is that they are \u201cat the same level of detail\u201d as the code itself. The code is clear in its intention, therefore the comments are redundant.\n John goes on to state that, to be useful, comments should provide a level detail not deducible from the code:\n Comments augment the code by providing information at a different level of detail. Some comments provide information at a lower, more detailed, level than the code; these comments add  precision by clarifying the exact meaning of the code. Other comments provide information at a higher, more abstract, level than the code; these comments offer  intuition, such as the reasoning behind the code, or a simpler and more abstract way of thinking about the code.\n I think this is a very fair and rationale explanation around what makes comments in code useful or not.\n  If somebody says a comment isn\u2019t adding any value, I would ask: to whom?\n Personally, I\u2019ve never liked the advice that writing obvious comments is bad practice\u2014probably because I write obvious comments all the time.\n Comments which are at the same level of detail as the code may not be useful to you as a fluent reader and writer of code, but they are to someone like me who is still figuring out how to read and write code. I find them useful as I  write code because they allow me to state my intention (in plain English), translate it to code, then compare statements and see how well I\u2019ve achieved my goal.\n Granted, if you\u2019re collaborating with a team of people then you have to figure out how to write code together. And that might mean compromising and cutting out comments that are helpful to you but distracting to others (you can always do that at the end of your process of authoring the code).\n Maybe this is an obvious statement, but if writing \u201cuseless\u201d code comments helps you, then they are not  useless. They\u2019re the opposite:  useful.\n It reminds me of when I learned Spanish. People always said, \u201cdon\u2019t do translation word for word in your head. Let the words mean what they mean in their natural language.\u201d Yet this is precisely what I would do when I first learned the language:\n  Eventually I became fluent enough where I didn\u2019t need to do this manual, step-by-step, line-by-line translation in my head. Words had their own meaning in their own language. At that point, I realized it was useless (for me) to translate into English in my head.\n  // What is your name?\u00bfComo te llamas?// My name is JimMe llamo Jim.// Where is the library?\u00bfDonde esta la biblioteca?\n Given what people say about code comments, you might think comments like these are useless. From John\u2019s book:\n Could someone who has never seen the code write the comment just by looking at the code next to the comment? If the answer is yes...then the comment doesn&#39;t make the code any easier to understand.\n Do those comments help the code become easier to understand? Well, that depends on who you ask.\n Saying code comments are useless is a judgement from us as fluent readers of the code. It disregards the value comments have for someone less fluent than yourself who is either reading or writing code.\n If you don\u2019t consider yourself fluent, you might derive a lot of value from comments others label useless, obvious, or redundant because they help you translate something you&#39;re not that familiar with\u2014another language\u2014into something you are\u2014English, for example.\n And comments can serve a very different purpose when they\u2019re being read vs. when they\u2019re being written.

The experience there is a big part of the draw, so his staff would only send out a few orders a day, tops, and he didn\u2019t mind partnering with companies like Seamless, he said, despite the 30 percent they\u2019d charge in fees. But once the city locked down, Fuquay did what few restaurateurs were willing to do: He cut ties with the apps. Instead, Fuquay reached out directly to customers, put flyers in people\u2019s takeout orders asking them not to use the apps, and retrained service staff so they could do delivery work.\n  Yet the Grubhub orders kept coming. So did Postmates. Fuquay didn\u2019t work with them in any official way; they simply put his restaurant on the site, and picked up orders and delivered them. Not only were they still charging his customers fees; they were using old menus, promising customers meals he hadn\u2019t made in years, like duck breast in mole sauce. That led to confused and upset customers, negative reviews, and a general frustration that tech giants are gaining from his business and leaving him with little to show for it. \u201cIt\u2019s misrepresenting my business to the public,\u201d Fuquay said. \u201cWhat I lose is the ability to control the transaction with the customer, the ability to market my own current menu and my own current prices, and to resolve any issues that come up.\u201d He tried calling them time and time again, but the response, he said, has been the same: \u201cCrickets.\u201d\n  Now, New York is on the verge of allowing restaurants like the Queensboro to have more control over their own deliveries. Mark Gjonaj, a Bronx City Council member and chair of the Committee on Small Business, is set to introduce a new bill on Thursday that would make it illegal for third-party delivery companies to add restaurants to their apps without explicit permission \u2014\u00a0and would fine the companies as much as $1,000 a day, per restaurant, for violating those terms, according to a version of the bill obtained by Curbed. \u201cOften in cases where a restaurant doesn\u2019t want to be included on a third-party marketplace, it\u2019s because they lose quality control on the food, and they give up having a direct relationship with their own customers \u2014 both put restaurants in a no-win situation,\u201d Gjonaj told Curbed. \u201cNow more than ever, locally owned restaurants should be able to control their business and how it operates. If they want to sign up for a delivery service, then great. If they don\u2019t, they shouldn\u2019t have to grovel to tech companies and hope to be taken off of a platform that may be harmful to their business.\u201d\n  The law, should it pass, would potentially double penalties imposed by a state  bill from Staten Island state senator Diane Savino that nixes the practice statewide. The state bill, which passed both legislative houses in May and will go to the governor for review in the next few weeks, also allows restaurants to pursue legal action against third-party delivery companies for adding them. And it\u2019s coming as city lawmakers are looking to redouble their efforts to rein in the middleman apps, just as restaurants that survived the pandemic are able to return at full capacity. \u201cWith the struggles that restaurants have faced over the last year, this legislation will help ensure that they are not taken advantage of,\u201d Senator Savino said. Surreptitiously adding restaurants has been a delivery  practice for years. DoorDash and Postmates, now owned by Uber, were exemplars of the practice, and used it to fuel their Silicon Valley\u2013style growth. Seamless, the parent company of Grubhub, soon  followed suit, adding hundreds of thousands of restaurants in a race for market domination. While the growth has been undeniable \u2014\u00a0especially during the pandemic \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s still a generally  unprofitable industry.\n  By the time the pandemic started in\u00a0March 2020, tension had been building for years between New York City\u2019s restaurant industry and these tech-enabled delivery companies.\u00a0Seamless and DoorDash, they complained, charged extremely high fees, discouraged indoor dining \u2014\u00a0where restaurateurs typically make more per meal \u2014\u00a0and actually made it  more confusing than before for some customers. By May, just a few weeks into the lockdown, the City Council had passed a suite of emergency laws temporarily capping fees and reining in their ability to charge commissions for orders made through their phone systems\u2014\u00a0a situation that\u2019s had the potential to\u00a0 cost restaurants thousands of dollars extra a month. Those bills expire this August, and Gjonaj\u2019s office is planning on holding a hearing later this month to discuss making them permanent as well as making phone-ordering fees more  transparent. \u201cMy colleagues and I are currently considering whether it is needed to temporarily extend, make permanent, or allow the laws to sunset,\u201d Gjonaj said.\n  The reaction from delivery companies has been mixed. Uber declined to comment. DoorDash had already  announced in November that it was ending the practice of adding restaurants to the platform without their explicit permission, though it\u00a0has retained the ones that it already listed, according to a person familiar with the business. \u201cWe\u2019re proud that the odds of staying in business during the pandemic are eight times better for restaurants on DoorDash, and we commend efforts to support local merchants and ensure that they are heard,\u201d a DoorDash spokeswoman said.\n  Grubhub, which started adding these so-called non-partner restaurants only in 2019, didn\u2019t directly address questions about the new bills, but said it\u2019s\u00a0 supportive of local restaurants that want out. \u201cWe\u2019re developing tools that make it easier for restaurants to claim their menus or request to be removed from our platform, and if a restaurant would not like to be included on Grubhub, they can reach out to us at  restaurants@grubhub.com,\u201d a company spokesman said.\n  New York has generally been among the most aggressive states in pushing back against the delivery companies. While the restaurant industry has been battered by the pandemic \u2014\u00a0Andrew Rigie, executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, told Curbed  that there are still about 130,000 fewer jobs in the city \u2014  lawmakers have been more receptive to getting them back. \u201cWe need to have penalties for non-compliance,\u201d Rigie said.\u00a0\u201cMany of these are billion-dollar corporations. We\u2019ve seen they are willing to exploit local restaurants, they try to creatively wiggle around laws so they don\u2019t impact them, and even in cases when laws are in effect, they willfully break them.\u201d Fuquay said that while the Queensboro has been able to rally its customers to support it, not every restaurant would be able to pull that off. \u201cSome restaurants feel trapped, and those restaurants are usually the least well-resourced,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve connected the dots in a way that a lot of restaurants don\u2019t have the resources to do, and they\u2019re being exploited by these companies.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-18 08:12:15", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6551\u63f4,finally,rigie", "title":

", "note_en": "State of Repair is Motherboard&#39;s exploration of DIY culture, device repair, ownership, and the forces fighting to lock down access to the things you own.\n  On Thursday, Congressman Joseph Morelle (D-NY) filed national right-to-repair legislation with Congress. The Fair Repair Act would require manufacturers to provide device owners and independent repair stores access to the tools, parts, and information they need to fix electronics. If it passed, people could fix their own stuff without having to return their stuff without going through the people who made it. Farmers could fix their own tractors and we could all more easily fix our own phones.\n    Thus far, the overwhelming majority of right-to-repair legislation has been introduced at the state level; national legislation would obviously make implementation easier, because it would prevent different states from having different laws about electronics that all Americans own.\n  \u201cFor too long, large corporations have hindered the progress of small business owners and everyday Americans by preventing them from the right to repair their own equipment,\u201d Rep. Morelle said in a   statement. \u201cIt\u2019s long past time to level the playing field, which is why I\u2019m so proud to introduce the Fair Repair Act and put the power back in the hands of consumers. This common-sense legislation will help make technology repairs more accessible and affordable for items from cell phones to laptops to farm equipment, finally giving individuals the autonomy they deserve.\u201d\n  Morelle has previously tried to pass right-to-repair legislation at the   state level when he was Assembly Majority Leader of New York in 2018. The bill died before anyone could vote on it. But that was three years ago and a lot has changed. More than   half the states in the country are considering some form of right-to-repair legislation. Last week, the New York state Senate   passed right-to-repair legislation similar to what Morelle has filed at Congress.\n    The legislation is overwhelmingly popular with both Democrats and Republicans, but getting bills passed has been very difficult because major companies and lobbying groups have managed to scare legislators in many states and have gotten the bills killed.\n  &#34;Right to Repair just makes sense. It saves money and it keeps electronics in use and off the scrap heap. It helps farmers keep equipment in the field and out of the dealership,\u201d Nathan Proctor, U.S. PIRG Senior Right to Repair Campaign Director, said in a   press release. \u201cNo matter how many lobbyists Apple, Microsoft, John Deere and other big companies hire to put obstacles in the way of us fixing our stuff, Right to Repair keeps pushing ahead, thanks to champions such as Rep. Morelle.&#34;\n  The Fair Repair Act does more than force the manufacturer&#39;s hand, it punishes them if they don\u2019t comply. \u201cThis bill allows for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to penalize those who violate these provisions through civil penalties including payment of damages, reformation of contracts, and refund of money or property,\u201d Morelle said in a   press release. \u201cIt also empowers the FTC to promulgate any rules or regulations necessary to carry out these enforcement duties. The Fair Repair Act authorizes state attorneys general to enforce the bill\u2019s provisions as well.\u201d\n  \u201cAt iFixit, we believe that big tech companies shouldn\u2019t get to dictate how we use the things we own or keep us from fixing our stuff,\u201d iFixit\u2019s US Policy Lead, Kerry Maeve Sheehan, told Motherboard. \u201cWe applaud Congressman Morelle for taking the fight for Right to Repair to Congress and standing up for farmers, independent repair shops, and consumers nationwide.\u201d\n  People want to fix their   own stuff. No one wants to pay $400 to replace an iPhone when a cheap fix would solve all their problems. But this issue affects more than just consumer electronics. Farmers have been dealing with this issue for years.

", "note_en": "This acquisition comes just a few months after the Philadelphia-based startup  announced a $1.15 billion funding round at a $8.9 billion valuation, up from $3.9 billion in October. Last fall, the company also  raised $380 million and  bought BevMo, a beverage retailer. Gopuff did not share its updated valuation with this new acquisition.\n Gopuff provides delivery of everything from cleaning and pet products to over-the-counter medication and food in more than 650 U.S. cities, charging $1.95 for delivery that happens in 30 minutes or less and is available either very late or even 24/7.\n  This will be incredibly important as the company looks to expand into New York this year, a place where residents expect high rent prices to come with the opportunity to have anything from hummus to diapers delivered at 4 a.m. Speaking of diapers, Gopuff told TechCrunch it has just doubled its baby category and added hundreds of new local products, and that it has expanded to delivering beauty products and  \u201cbetter-for-you\u201d products, which seem to be a mix of organic stuff and healthier snacks.\n  Gopuff also  acquired U.K.-based Fancy Delivery in May, marking its first entrance into international markets. As the company prepares to expand in more complex and high-density cities and enter into new verticals, Gopuff says rideOS\u2019s tech geared toward advanced routing, complex dispatch and fleet optimization will be essential. The company aims to use its new IP to better power multimodal deliveries and reduce delivery times.\n By acquiring rideOS, Gopuff also hopes to improve its unit economics and develop new tools to help both its delivery managers and partners be more organized and efficient on the ground, the company says. RideOS, a platform created and led by former Uber, Google and Apple employees in the mapping and ride-hailing space, sees this acquisition as a chance to scale and stay at the forefront of defining the Instant Needs economy.\n \u201cGopuff\u2019s mission and global ambition to be the world\u2019s go-to solution for immediate everyday needs is a natural extension of rideOS\u2019 vision to build software that efficiently moves people and things throughout the world,\u201d said Justin Ho, co-founder and CEO of rideOS, in a statement. \u201cGiven Gopuff\u2019s exponential growth, we expect to significantly increase our headcount by the end of this year, expanding our presence in Silicon Valley, Pittsburgh, and Berlin.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-18 07:34:22", "source_domain":

The map also includes data on places that reported a lack of connection by computer, smartphone or tablet and information on broadband usage in high-poverty communities.\n &#34;What it tells you is there&#39;s a lot of places in the United States that aren&#39;t using the internet at broadband speeds,&#34; a White House official told Axios, estimating that means tens of millions of people.\n The big picture: The Biden administration originally proposed a $100 billion investment in broadband as part of the American Jobs Plan infrastructure package.\n \u201cAs we release this important data to the public, it paints a sobering view of the challenges facing far too many Americans as they try to connect to high-speed broadband and participate in our modern economy,\u201d Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a statement.\n The intrigue: The map shows the gulf between the data set the FCC has used to map broadband availability and where Americans actually report using the internet.\n The FCC relies on data supplied by internet service providers about where they could offer service.\n Companies can report that a census block is served even if only one household has internet service \u2014 which leads to maps that  overstates access.\n &#34;There&#39;s a large gap between what the carriers are saying is on offer to be used and what&#39;s actually being used,&#34; the White House official told Axios.\n Yes, but: Acting FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel announced a broadband mapping task force earlier this year to improve the agency&#39;s data collection and mapping tools.\n The FCC uses its maps to allocate billions of dollars of subsidies for broadband deployment.\n The administration effort is not meant to replace those maps or guide broadband funding grants, the White House says.\n What they&#39;re saying: &#34;To ensure that every household has the internet access necessary for success in the digital age, we need better ways to accurately measure where high-speed service has reached Americans and where it has not,\u201d Rosenworcel said in a statement.\n The new map project is &#34;a welcome new tool that provides valuable insight into the state of broadband across the country,&#34; she said.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 07:27:20", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u663e\u793a,house,\u5bbd\u5e26", "title":

stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.\u201d What he meant was that objective, raw numbers don\u2019t lie\u2014and this remains true hundreds of years later.\n We just got yet another example. A   new data analysis  from Harvard University, Brown University, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation calculates how different employment levels have been impacted during the pandemic to date. The findings reveal that government lockdown orders devastated workers at the bottom of the financial food chain but left the upper-tier actually  better  off.\n The analysis examined employment levels in January 2020, before the coronavirus spread widely and before lockdown orders and other restrictions on the economy were implemented. It compared them to employment figures from March 31, 2021.\n  Employment for lower-wage workers, defined as earning less than $27,000 annually, declined by a whopping 23.6 percent over the time period. Employment for middle-wage workers, defined as earning from $27,000 to $60,000, declined by a modest 4.5 percent. However, employment for high-wage workers, defined as earning more than $60,000, actually  increased  2.4 percent over the measured time period despite the country\u2019s economic turmoil.\n   The data are damning. They offer yet another reminder that government lockdowns hurt most those who could least afford it.\n Some critics argue that the pandemic, not government lockdowns, are the true source of this economic duress. While there\u2019s no doubt the virus itself played some role, government lockdowns were undoubtedly the single biggest factor. It\u2019s pretty intuitive that ordering people not to patronize businesses and criminalizing peoples\u2019 livelihoods would hurt the economy. This intuition is   confirmed by data  and   studies showing as much . And don\u2019t forget the fact that heavy lockdown states have consistently   had much higher unemployment rates  than states that took a more laissez-faire approach.\n Others might insist that the mitigation of the spread of COVID-19 accomplished by lockdowns justifies this economic fallout. But this argument fails to account for the many peer-reviewed studies showing lockdown orders   did not effectively slow the pandemic\u2019s spread , or the painfully inconvenient fact that most COVID-19 spread occurred not in workplaces, restaurants, or gyms   but at home . (Making \u201cstay-at-home orders\u201d seem like   an astonishing mistake in hindsight .)\n So, all lockdowns really seem to have accomplished is at best a mild delay in the pandemic\u2019s trajectory in exchange for a host of   lethal unintended consequences  such as a   mental health crisis  and   skyrocketing drug overdoses . And, as we now know, a highly regressive economic fallout for the working class.\n Of course, Ivy League researchers almost certainly did not intend to expose the failings of big government pandemic policies when they set out to catalog employment data. But, as Adams said, facts are stubborn things.\n Like this story?

", "note_en": "Microsoft is getting ready to announce the biggest update to Windows since Windows 10\u2019s debut in 2015. Even though the company hasn\u2019t officially revealed much about this update, all signs -- including a major leak of an early Windows 11 build -- point to it offering a significantly different experience.\n  Though Microsoft hasn\u2019t confirmed the name change, it has strongly hinted at it, both in the artwork for its June 24 press event and in its 11 a.m. starting time. And, the leaked Windows 11 build shows Windows 11 as the official name in the system information menu. In\n    Microsoft started teasing Windows 11 on June 2 with an invitation to a digital event called \u201cWhat\u2019s Next for Windows\u201d scheduled for June 24 at 11 a.m. ET. The invitation featured a GIF showcasing a redesigned Windows logo that defies the laws of physics by casting just two shadows that, if you squint, look a bit like \u201c11.\u201d\n  Join us June 24th at 11 am ET for the #MicrosoftEvent to see what\u2019s next. https://t.co/kSQYIDZSyi pic.twitter.com/Emb5GPHOf0 June 2, 2021\n  Right now, there are no official screen shots, but a leaked build that appeared on June 15, 2021 offers a lot of information on at least some of the UI changes. Windows Central recorded a detailed hands-on video with the leak, which we&#39;ve embedded below. Keep in mind that this is an alleged leak so may not be real and, even if it is, it would be an early build with a ton of features missing.\n    Taskbar: the default icons, including the Start button and search button are in the middle, a position which reminds us a lot of Chrome OS. However, you can tweak the location in settings so that the icons appear on the traditional, left side of the taskbar.\n Start menu: It&#39;s a new Windows so, of course, there&#39;s a new Start menu design. This one eschews live tiles for simple icons that show your pinned apps, along with recommended apps and files. A menu button that says &#34;All apps&#34; lets you see more icons.\n  Start menu options: There  seems to be an option to have the Start menu, Taskbar, and other interface elements appear on the left side of the screen if you prefer, which should make the transition to Windows 11 a bit easier for long-time Windows users.\n  Search box pops up: Instead of having a search box within the task bar, there&#39;s only a magnifying glass icon, which you click to get a search menu.\n  File explorer icons: The folder icons are more colorful, particularly for standard folders like \u00a0Documents and Pictures.\n Snap assist menu: If you hover over the minimize / maximize button, Windows 11 gives you a list of choices for snapping your windows to either side of the screen or into quarters.\n  A redesigned Ink Workspace: Windows 11&#39;s new Ink Workspace panel  appears to offer more customization than its predecessor thanks to support for additional software\u2014the Windows 10 version was limited to the first-party Snip &amp; Sketch and Microsoft Whiteboard apps\u2014as well as some user interface tweaks.\n  New system sounds: Some of the sounds like the Asterisk, which sounds a lot like the tone you hear when some elevator doors open, are new.\n Touch gestures: You can now use three finger swipes to minimize / maximize an app. \u00a0Tapping with four fingers lets you switch among virtual desktops.\n  Before the leak pretty-much confirmed it, there were many reasons to believe the new Windows would be called Windows 11. Those shadows in the Tweet picture probably would have been enough to inspire speculation about Windows 11 on their own, but scheduling the event for 11 a.m. ET also helped. Many of Microsoft\u2019s events are held later in the day \u2014 especially since the pandemic forced those events to be online-only \u2014 because the company is based on the West Coast. The working theory is that Microsoft wouldn\u2019t have scheduled an event so early in the day without a good reason; synchronicity with the new version number would qualify.\n A screen shot of the system information page from the leaked build shows the version as Windows 11 Pro.\n   As for why everyone thinks Microsoft is moving on from  Windows 10 even though it was supposed to be \u201c  the last version of Windows\u201d? Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said at the   Build 2021 developer conference in May that the company plans to \u201cshare one of the most significant updates to Windows of the past decade,\u201d which he called \u201cthe next generation of Windows,\u201d some time \u201csoon\u201d after the conference. So the speculation is supported by more than just a GIF and an event\u2019s start time.\n Microsoft accidentally revealed that it\u2019s working on a new version of Windows in a support document too, with  Windows Latest reporting on June 9 that the document offered to teach readers \u201dabout managing applications in Windows 10 and Windows Sun Valley.\u201d That mention all but confirms Microsoft is planning to release a new version of Windows in the near future and will continue to support Windows 10 in the meantime.\n The document previously referred to &#34;Windows Sun Valley,&#34; but that&#39;s since been removed. Windows 11 seems like the most likely name for the update, but it\u2019s not like Windows Sun Valley would seem outlandish  compared to other  platforms\u2019 version names.\n A more intentional teaser for the next generation of Windows arrived on June 10 when Microsoft published a &#34;slo-fi remix&#34; video of the OS&#39; startup sounds.\n &#34;Having trouble relaxing because you\u2019re too excited for the June 24th Microsoft Event?&#34; the video description reads. &#34;Take a slow trip down memory lane with the Windows 95, XP and 7 startup sounds slowed down to a meditative 4,000% reduced speed.&#34;\n   Microsoft also  updated the lifecycle documentation for Windows 10 Home and Pro to say it will officially drop support for the Home, Pro, Pro Education, and Pro for Workstation versions of the operating system on October 14, 2025. (It didn&#39;t say how long the enterprise-specific versions of Windows 10 will continue to be supported.)\n Continued support for individual versions of Windows 10 will vary. Microsoft said the Windows 10 May 2021 Update will stop being supported on December 13, 2022 but also said it &#34;will continue to support at least one Windows 10 Semi-Annual Channel until October 14, 2025.&#34;\n Regardless of the specific timeline, publicly announcing that Windows 10 support will come to an end is the surest sign yet that Microsoft is planning to leave that branding behind with the update arriving on June 24.\n Also, consider that changing the name of Windows is a great way to generate interest and even spur more PC sales. Everytime there&#39;s a new version of Windows, shopppers want to buy computers with that OS pre-installed, even if upgrading is easy.\n  Reports indicate that Microsoft has been planning many changes to the Windows 10 user experience for a while now. Windows Central   reported in October that the company was looking to \u201cupdate many top-level user interfaces, such as the Start menu, Action Center and even File Explorer with consistent modern designs, better animations and new features\u201d via a project known internally as \u201cSun Valley\u201d\u2014the same codename used in the aforementioned support document.\n Sun Valley wasn\u2019t supposed to replace the Fluent Design language Microsoft   introduced at Build 2017 and expanded to   iOS, Android and the web in 2019, Windows Central said, but was instead meant to expand the design language to additional parts of Windows. This would likely result in a more cohesive user experience than the hodgepodge of design languages present in Windows 10.\n  Some of these small-but-notable design problems   were pointed out by Microsoft program manager Yulia Klein in the public GitHub repository for WinUI in November 2020. Klein said that \u201cXAML controls are inconsistent with how web and mobile apps are evolving\u201d and that her proposed changes were \u201cpart of the work to refresh Xaml UI to align with other platforms while looking familiar on Windows.\u201d\n The proposal included changes to toggle switches, sliders and rating controls used throughout Windows. These user interface elements are nearly ubiquitous; changes would likely have a greater-than-expected effect on the OS&#39; design. Klein\u2019s post also made it clear that Microsoft was indeed looking to update Windows\u2019 design, lending credence to the Windows Central report from a month prior.\n  Microsoft\u2019s plans to modernize the Windows user experience were all but confirmed   by a job listing in January that said:\n \u201cOn this team, you\u2019ll work with our key platform, Surface and OEM partners to orchestrate and deliver a sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows experiences to signal to our customers that Windows is BACK and ensure that Windows is considered the best user OS experience for customers.\u201d\n Another  job listing seeking a Senior Program Manager was  posted in April. Microsoft said whoever it hired would be \u201cbuilding new parts and modernizing existing parts of the Windows UX\u201d and that it was \u201clooking for someone who will work with design, research, and prototypers to envision how people will interact with Windows devices in the future.\u201d The company is no longer accepting new applications for the position, which suggests it either found the right candidate or is late in the interview process.\n  It wasn\u2019t hard to connect the dots between Sun Valley and that job listing. As for what this \u201csweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows\u201d might look like? Well, those also came from Microsoft itself.\n The company planned to make several changes to the user experience for Windows 10X, the OS meant for foldable devices   that was repurposed to single-screen devices and   eventually cancelled altogether.\n Microsoft released a   Windows 10X emulator for developers at Build 2020 that showcased a few user experience changes, including a redesigned app switcher, new Start menu and Quick Settings menu for commonly used controls. Now that the changes originally meant for Windows 10X are   reaching Windows proper instead, it would make sense for some of these elements to make their way to Windows 11.\n The similarities between screenshots from the June 15th leak and Windows 10X are readily apparent. Simply compare this:\n    These user experience changes probably won\u2019t be as stark as the jump from Windows 7 to Windows 8. It seems more like Microsoft is fully committing to the Fluent Design language it revealed 4 years ago, looking to improve the Windows experience on touchscreen devices and making seemingly inconsequential changes that culminate in a familiar, yet noticeably different, way of using Windows.\n  Windows 11 might not just change the way the OS looks; it   could also change the way people find, purchase and install software. That seems to be what Microsoft is hoping, at least, because the company is reportedly working to make the Microsoft Store more important to Windows users and developers alike.\n  Windows Central   reported in April that Microsoft plans to make three developer-facing changes to its software distribution platform: allowing unpackaged Win32 apps into the Microsoft Store, letting developers host apps and updates themselves and permitting the use of third-party commerce platforms. All three would make it easier for Windows developers to offer their products via the Microsoft Store in addition to (or instead of) other distribution options.\n The company is also appealing directly to developers\u2019 wallets. It   announced at Build 2021 that it will reduce the cut of game sales revenues the Microsoft Store gets from 30% to 12%.\n That change isn\u2019t groundbreaking (the Epic Games Store offers a similar arrangement) but does make the Microsoft Store more competitive with platforms like Steam. It\u2019s also less than the cut Microsoft takes for other apps sold via the Microsoft Store.\n Microsoft currently takes a 15% cut of the revenues from many apps sold via its platform. It also takes a 30% cut from app and in-app purchases made via the \u201cMicrosoft Store for Business; Microsoft Store for Education; Microsoft Store on Windows 8 devices; or Microsoft Store on Windows Phone 8 devices\u201d per the   App Developer Agreement updated in July 2020. Maybe the new rate for game sales hasn\u2019t been added because similar changes are coming to other apps.\n  The Microsoft Store is also expected to receive a visual overhaul similar to the rest of Windows 11, according to the Windows Central report, as well as updates meant to provide \u201ca more stable download and install experience for large apps and games.\u201d Both could improve the experience of finding software via Microsoft\u2019s storefront (even if many Windows users are likely to continue installing apps via the web or competitive platforms simply because that\u2019s what they&#39;re used to).\n This is also a symbiotic relationship. Right now Microsoft has to figure out how to get developers to ship their apps via the Microsoft Store even though it\u2019s not popular among consumers, which means it has to get consumers to download apps via the Microsoft Store even though many developers aren\u2019t invested in the platform. A new version of Windows (aka Windows 11) provides the perfect opportunity for Microsoft to address both of those problems without carrying the baggage associated with the store\u2019s current iteration.\n  This might be the biggest question mark ahead of Microsoft\u2019s event. The company usually releases major updates to Windows 10 twice a year: once in the spring and once in the fall. The   Windows 10 May 2021 Update&#39;s release last month makes a September or October launch window for Windows 11 seem like a possibility.\n It can be hard to predict OS release dates, however. Microsoft announced Windows 10X in February 2020 with a planned fall 2020 release date, then announced in July 2020 that the it wouldn\u2019t arrive until 2021, before finally saying in May that it was being shelved for the foreseeable future.\n Major updates to Windows 10 have also been delayed in the past, with the Windows 10 October 2018 Update only   starting its automatic rollout in January 2019.\n The safe bet would probably be for Windows 11 to arrive sometime between September and December. Microsoft will likely release Preview Builds before then, however, so those curious about the future of Windows should probably sign up for the  Windows Insider Program if they\u2019re comfortable using unstable software.\n After its release date is revealed, the next question would be how Windows users will be able to upgrade to it. Will it be a free update, or will it follow previous versions of the operating system by involving some kind of upgrade fee? The leaked build of Windows 11  suggests it will be the former, with configuration keys reportedly indicating that Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 users might be able to upgrade for free. (Presumably that free upgrade path would also be available to Windows 10 users.)\n  Microsoft plans to reveal Windows 11 \u2014 or at least the update everyone has taken to calling Windows 11 \u2014 during the \u201cWhat\u2019s Next for Windows\u201d virtual event on June 24 at 11 a.m. ET. \u00a0Microsoft will livestream the even   on its website and has designated &#34;#MicrosoftEvent&#34; for use on social media.\n      I think you can add  two   leakers claiming Microsoft  is internally developing Windows 11. Whether &#34;11&#34; is a code name or a marketing name seems to be the question now.  In the end, it&#39;s Panos Panay: the guy will trip if Windows doesn&#39;t get the &#34;pumped&#34; hype he so desperately wants. Look at how they marketed the now-cancelled 10X: &#34;a revolution!&#34;  Android 12, iOS 15, MacOS 12, Chrome OS 91 (and 92 and 93 and 94), etc., Microsoft looks ancient with Windows 10. Why does this matter? PC hardware OEMs   need new marketing OS versions to sell to mainstream consumers, businesses, etc.\n   Reply\n I think you can add  two  leakers claiming Microsoft  is internally developing Windows 11.

The idea that Windows is suddently going to fundamentally change how we interact with our PCs while running Win32 software is debatable.... because we know how many Metro/Modern/UWP productivity apps Microsoft released for Windows.  Do you know... if you click on a photo in File Manager, Display it with the Photos App, Decide you like to Email it someone... so You select Share To... and you are looking for Microsoft Outlook which is part of your Ofice 365 subscription..... uhhhh.. It don&#39;t work... funny... I can do that with my android phone (Outlook for Android will even prompt me to reduce the file size). Windows, File Manager, Photos and Outlook are from the same company and their isn&#39;t a seemless way to share.....  When I see that my wife, who is not as computer saavy as me, cannot accomplish things like this easily... I question if anyone in Redmond is even paying attention to users at all..... The only thing revolutionary about the next version of WIndows is that it will be monotized through subscription services, just like Azure and Office... I don&#39;t know even know why I&#39;m posting this... no one cares....\n   Reply\n The Windows Store and XBox should be removed from Windows entirely but I doubt MS will do that.
