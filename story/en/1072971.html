The only people who’ve paid the price are a human rights lawyer and those whose land was poisoned</p><p>雪佛龙被指控污染亚马逊长达26年。唯一付出代价的人是一名人权律师和那些土地被毒害的人</p><p>   M ost people have probably heard of Chernobyl, or the BP oil spill. You may also know about my legal battle over contaminated water in California, dramatized in the movie Erin Brockovich. Yet far fewer people have heard about what transpired in the Ecuadorian Amazon – though it’s  considered by  some  activists,  journalists, and  members of US Congress to be one of the world’s worst environmental disasters.</p><p>大多数人可能听说过切尔诺贝利或英国石油公司的漏油事件。你可能还知道我在加利福尼亚州因污染水而进行的法律斗争，这场斗争在电影《艾琳·布罗科维奇》（Erin Brockovich）中上演。然而，很少有人听说厄瓜多尔亚马逊发生了什么——尽管一些活动人士、记者和美国国会议员认为这是世界上最严重的环境灾难之一。</p><p> What if I told you that a multinational oil company allegedly polluted the Amazon for almost three decades? And that the oil company has spent even more years refusing to accept liability? Or that a US attorney who agreed to represent thousands of Ecuadorian villagers in a lawsuit against that oil company has lost his law license, income, spent hundreds of days under house arrest in New York, and in 2021 was  sentenced to six months in prison?</p><p>如果我告诉你，一家跨国石油公司据称污染了亚马逊近30年，那会怎么样？而这家石油公司又花了更多的时间拒绝承担责任？或者是一位美国律师同意代表数千名厄瓜多尔村民起诉这家石油公司，他失去了法律许可，收入，在纽约被软禁了数百天，2021年被判六个月监禁。</p><p>   From 1964 to 1990, Texaco, which merged with Chevron in 2001, allegedly  spilled more than  16m gallons of crude oil – “80 times more oil than was spilled in BP’s 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster”, according to Gizmodo – and  18bn gallons of polluted wastewater in the Amazon rainforest. The pollution allegedly contaminated the ground and waterways with  toxic chemicals that the plaintiffs – mostly Indigenous people and poor farmers – say has  caused  cancer, miscarriages, skin conditions and birth defects. (Chevron has said that Texaco’s operations were “completely in line with the standards of the day” and  told the New Yorker, in 2012, that “there is no corroborating evidence” for the health allegations.)</p><p>从1964年到1990年，2001年与雪佛龙合并的德士古公司（Texaco）据称泄漏了1600多万加仑原油——据Gizmodo称，“是英国石油公司2010年深水地平线灾难泄漏量的80倍”——以及亚马逊雨林180亿加仑的污水。据称，污染用有毒化学品污染了地面和水道，原告——主要是土著居民和贫穷的农民——称这些有毒化学品已导致癌症、流产、皮肤状况和出生缺陷。（雪佛龙曾表示德士古的运营“完全符合当时的标准”，并在2012年告诉《纽约客》：“没有确凿的证据”支持这些健康指控。）</p><p> In 1993, Steven Donziger, a recent Harvard law school graduate and human rights attorney, began working on an  environmental case on behalf of Ecuadorians allegedly affected by Texaco’s drilling. The case eventually became a  30,000-person class action lawsuit against Texaco in New York federal court.</p><p>1993年，哈佛大学法学院毕业生、人权律师史蒂文·唐齐格（Steven Donziger）开始为据称受德士古钻井影响的厄瓜多尔人处理一个环境案件。该案最终成为纽约联邦法院针对德士古公司的一场3万人的集体诉讼。</p><p> Texaco/Chevron  did not  dispute that pollution occurred, and “freely admits that large sludge pits still dot the Amazon”, the New Yorker  reported. The company argued that the Ecuadorian government released it from liability after paying for an earlier cleanup, and that Ecuador’s state oil company, Petroecuador, was responsible for the remaining damage. The plaintiffs argued that the earlier cleanup was woefully insufficient; that Texaco, not Petroecuador, directed  actual operations in the area; and that Chevron’s earlier agreement with the government of Ecuador  did not bar lawsuits by individuals. (The government of Ecuador also disagrees with Chevron’s claims.)</p><p>据《纽约客》报道，德士古/雪佛龙对污染的发生没有异议，并且“坦率地承认，亚马逊地区仍有大型污泥坑”。该公司辩称，厄瓜多尔政府在支付了早些时候的清理费用后免除了其责任，厄瓜多尔国家石油公司Petroecuador对剩余的损害负责。原告辩称，早期的清理工作严重不足；德士古公司（Texaco）而非厄瓜多尔石油公司（Petroecuador）负责该地区的实际运营；雪佛龙早些时候与厄瓜多尔政府达成的协议并没有禁止个人提起诉讼。（厄瓜多尔政府也不同意雪佛龙的说法。）</p><p> A jury trial in the US might have put Texaco under an embarrassing and costly spotlight, so, perhaps  for that  reason, the company lobbied to  move the legal proceedings back to Ecuador, which has no jury trials and is heavily dependent on the oil industry. Texaco  argued that Ecuador had a fair and competent legal system. A US judge agreed to relocate the case  on the condition that Texaco accept the verdict of the Ecuadorian system.</p><p>美国的陪审团审判可能会让德士古公司陷入尴尬且代价高昂的聚光灯下，因此，或许正是出于这个原因，该公司游说将法律程序移回厄瓜多尔。厄瓜多尔没有陪审团审判，而且严重依赖石油业。德士古认为厄瓜多尔有一个公平和称职的法律体系。一名美国法官同意重新审理此案，条件是德士古接受厄瓜多尔系统的裁决。</p><p> Texaco’s maneuver backfired: In 2011, Donziger and the plaintiffs won the case there. An Ecuadorian court ruled that Texaco, which had been bought by Chevron at this point, was “responsible for vast contamination”, according to  the New Yorker, and “ordered it to pay $18bn in damages – the largest judgment ever awarded in an environmental lawsuit”.</p><p>德士古的策略适得其反：2011年，唐齐格和原告在该案中胜诉。据《纽约客》报道，厄瓜多尔一家法院裁定，当时被雪佛龙收购的德士古公司“应对大量污染负责”，并“下令其支付180亿美元的赔偿金——这是环境诉讼中有史以来最高的判决”。</p><p> Both parties appealed the decision: Chevron  said it was “illegitimate and unenforceable” and accused the plaintiffs of having ghostwritten an expert environmental opinion; the plaintiffs denied that the opinion was fraudulent and said that, if anything, the monetary judgment was too low given the scale of pollution.</p><p>双方都对该裁决提出上诉：雪佛龙称其“不合法且不可执行”，并指控原告代写了一份环境专家意见书；原告否认该意见是欺诈性的，并表示，考虑到污染的规模，如果有什么区别的话，金钱判决太低了。</p><p> Chevron’s accusation that the judgment was illegitimate relied heavily on testimony by an Ecuadorian judge,  Alberto Guerra, whom Chevron  relocated to the US and, as of 2015,  paid a $12,000 monthly salary. Guerra testified that the plaintiffs had bribed him to sway the Ecuadorian judgment against Chevron. Guerra later recanted much of his claim – admitting, Vice News  reported in 2015, that “there is no evidence to corroborate allegations of a bribe or a ghostwritten judgment, and that large parts of his sworn testimony … were exaggerated and, in other cases, simply not true”.</p><p>雪佛龙对判决不合法的指控在很大程度上依赖于厄瓜多尔法官阿尔贝托·格拉的证词。雪佛龙将格拉调到美国，截至2015年，他支付了12000美元的月薪。格拉作证称，原告贿赂了他，以改变厄瓜多尔对雪佛龙的判决。格拉后来放弃了他的大部分主张——据《副新闻》在2015年报道，他承认“没有证据证实贿赂指控或鬼书判决，他宣誓的证词中有很大一部分……被夸大了，在其他情况下根本不真实”。</p><p> (Chevron disputes the significance of Guerra’s change in testimony,  telling Vice News, in 2015, that trial “transcripts make clear that Chevron proved its case before the international arbitration tribunal”.)</p><p>（雪佛龙对格拉改变证词的重要性提出质疑，2015年，他告诉《副新闻》，审判“记录表明雪佛龙在国际仲裁庭证明了自己的观点”。）</p><p> Part of the Ecuadorian judgment against Chevron was a fine for not apologizing for the pollution; in 2013, Ecuador’s national court of justice determined that “there had been no legal basis to sanction Chevron for not apologizing,” according to Reuters, and  reduced the judgment to $9.5bn, but otherwise affirmed the original decision.</p><p>厄瓜多尔对雪佛龙的判决中有一部分是因为没有为污染道歉而被罚款；据路透社报道，2013年，厄瓜多尔国家法院裁定“没有法律依据制裁雪佛龙不道歉”，并将判决减至95亿美元，但在其他方面维持了最初的判决。</p><p> Instead of accepting the legal outcome and the responsibilities that come when you acquire a company (see  Dupont-now-Chemours or  Monsanto-now-Bayer), Chevron “made clear that it would not be paying the judgment”, according to the  Intercept, and “moved its assets out of the country”. The company went from claiming Ecuador’s legal system was fair to claiming it was too corrupt to trust.</p><p>根据截获声明，雪佛龙没有接受收购一家公司时产生的法律后果和责任（参见杜邦现在的Chemours或孟山都现在的拜耳），而是“明确表示不会支付判决”，并“将其资产转移到国外”。该公司从声称厄瓜多尔的法律体系是公平的，到声称它太腐败而无法信任。</p><p> “We’re going to fight this until hell freezes over, and then we’ll fight it on the ice,” a Chevron attorney  vowed – “a remark that became a watchword at the company”, according to the Wall Street Journal. Chevron has more than made good on that promise. It has pursued a years-long campaign against the plaintiffs, their lawyers, and even the entire country of Ecuador.</p><p>据《华尔街日报》报道，雪佛龙公司的一名律师发誓说：“我们会一直战斗到地狱结束，然后我们会在冰上战斗。”。雪佛龙不仅兑现了这一承诺。它针对原告、他们的律师，甚至整个厄瓜多尔展开了长达数年的运动。</p><p> Chevron’s legal strategy is masterminded by Gibson Dunn, a  notoriously aggressive  corporate law firm that the Montana supreme court  rebuked in 2007, in a different case, for “legal thuggery” and “actual malice”.  Randy Mastro, a former federal prosecutor and aide to New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, leads the firm’s Chevron file. A “merciless litigator”, according to the  New Yorker, Mastro was once described as “the only person in the Giuliani administration who made the mayor seem like a nice guy”.</p><p>雪佛龙的法律策略是由吉布森·邓恩（Gibson Dunn）策划的，这是一家以咄咄逼人著称的公司法律事务所，蒙大拿州最高法院在2007年的另一个案件中谴责了该律师事务所的“法律恶作剧”和“实际恶意”。前联邦检察官、纽约市长鲁迪·朱利安尼的助手兰迪·马斯特罗负责该公司的雪佛龙档案。据《纽约客》报道，马斯特罗是一位“无情的诉讼律师”，曾被描述为“朱利安尼政府中唯一一位让市长看起来像个好人的人”。</p><p> Here’s the thing: a massive multinational corporation such as Chevron can afford to pay millions of dollars in legal fees, indefinitely – and doing so will almost always be cheaper than paying a fine or settling. Chevron “insists that delay is not its object”, Vanity Fair  reported in 2007, but the plaintiffs and their attorneys “are persuaded that it is.”</p><p>事情是这样的：雪佛龙这样的大型跨国公司可以无限期地支付数百万美元的法律费用——而且这样做几乎总是比支付罚款或和解更便宜。《名利场》在2007年报道，雪佛龙“坚称拖延不是它的目标”，但原告及其律师“被说服了”</p><p> “Take $6bn as a figure,” Donziger explained to Vanity Fair’s William Langewiesche. “Simply by sticking the money into a savings account  Chevron could make $300m for every year it doesn’t pay. That sum multiplied by the four years of the trial so far would amount to $1.2bn, which is far more than, say, $50m spent on legal fees, even if Chevron now loses the case. And what if Chevron wins – what would the calculation be then?”</p><p>“以60亿美元作为一个数字，”唐齐格向《名利场》的威廉·兰格维斯奇解释道。“只要把钱存入一个储蓄账户，雪佛龙每年就可以赚到3亿美元。这笔钱乘以迄今为止四年的审判金额，将达到12亿美元，远远超过，比如说，即使雪佛龙现在败诉，花在法律费用上的5000万美元。如果雪佛龙胜诉，那么计算结果会是什么呢？"</p><p> Corporations can also sue plaintiffs back – crushing any opposition under, to use  Chevron’s words, “an avalanche of paper”. This is part of a disturbing legal playbook sometimes known as  Slapp – strategic lawsuit against public participation. Massive corporations can fund endless litigation against activists or critics. They don’t even need to win in court, because they can intimidate or bankrupt their opponents in legal fees. (Chevron  disputes that it engages in Slapp tactics, though an anti-Slapp organization twice  named Chevron “corporate bully of the year” and in 2021  bestowed a “lifetime achievement award” on the company.)</p><p>公司也可以起诉原告——用雪佛龙的话来说，在“一大堆文件”下压制任何反对意见。这是一个令人不安的法律剧本的一部分，有时被称为Slapp——针对公众参与的战略诉讼。大型企业可以为针对活动人士或批评者的无休止的诉讼提供资金。他们甚至不需要在法庭上获胜，因为他们可以在法律费用上恐吓对手或使其破产。（雪佛龙争议说，它从事SLAP战术，虽然一个反SLAP组织两次命名为雪佛龙公司年度欺凌者，并在2021授予了“终身成就奖”的公司。）</p><p> After Chevron “successfully defeated a lawsuit seeking to hold it responsible for the shooting deaths of protesters on an offshore oil platform in Nigeria”, it even tried, unsuccessfully, “to compel the impoverished Nigerian plaintiffs, some of whom were widows or children, to reimburse its attorneys’ fees”, the New Yorker  reported in 2012.</p><p>《纽约客》在2012年报道，雪佛龙“成功挫败了一场要求其对在尼日利亚海上石油平台上开枪打死抗议者负责的诉讼”，它甚至试图“迫使贫穷的尼日利亚原告，其中一些人是寡妇或儿童，偿还其律师费”，但没有成功。</p><p> “That’s how they litigate,” Bert Voorhees, an attorney who represented the Nigerian plaintiffs, told the New Yorker’s Patrick Radden Keefe. “The point is to scare off the next community that might try to assert its human rights.”</p><p>代表尼日利亚原告的律师伯特·沃赫斯告诉《纽约客》的帕特里克·拉登·基夫：“他们就是这样打官司的。”。“关键是吓跑下一个可能试图维护其人权的社区。”</p><p> In 2018, an international tribunal  ruled that Chevron had been previously released from liability for pollution in the Amazon and  ordered Ecuador not to enforce the $9.5bn judgment. Ecuador continues to maintain that the judgment is legitimate.</p><p>2018年，一家国际法庭裁定，雪佛龙此前已被解除对亚马逊地区污染的责任，并下令厄瓜多尔不执行95亿美元的判决。厄瓜多尔继续坚持认为该判决是合法的。</p><p> In retaliation, “the giant US oil company objected last June when Washington proposed allowing duty-free rose imports from the world’s poorest countries, including Ecuador”, the Wall Street Journal  reported in 2021. “Letting Ecuador save money on flowers after blatant ‘acts of defiance’ would tell the world the US rewards bad behavior, the oil company said.”</p><p>《华尔街日报》2021年报指出，“去年六月，当华盛顿提议允许免税玫瑰从世界上最贫穷的国家进口，包括厄瓜多尔”时，美国巨人石油公司反对。这家石油公司说：“让厄瓜多尔在公然的‘违抗行为’后在鲜花上省钱，将告诉世界，美国会奖励不好的行为。”</p><p> Chevron has also  asked the international tribunal to order that “nearly $800m of Chevron’s legal costs [be] paid by Ecuador, a country whose gross domestic product is about half of Chevron’s stock-market value”.</p><p>雪佛龙还要求国际法庭下令“由厄瓜多尔支付雪佛龙近8亿美元的法律费用，厄瓜多尔的国内生产总值约为雪佛龙股票市值的一半”。</p><p> Then there’s Donziger. PR advisers for Chevron  promised to “demonize” Donziger in the public eye. The oil company “hired private investigators to track Donziger, created a  publication” which smeared him, and “put together a legal team of hundreds of lawyers from  60 firms, who have successfully pursued an extraordinary campaign against him”, the Intercept  reported in 2020.</p><p>还有唐齐格。雪佛龙的公关顾问承诺在公众眼中“妖魔化”唐齐格。这家石油公司“雇佣私人调查人员追踪唐齐格，制作了一份出版物”，对他进行了诽谤，并“组建了一个由来自60家公司的数百名律师组成的法律团队，他们成功地对唐齐格发起了一场非同寻常的运动”，截取报告于2020年。</p><p> Donziger has spent years of his life fighting seemingly endless litigation. In 2011, Chevron sued Donziger and members of the lawsuit in a US court for  $60m in damages, accusing them of extortion and invoking a sweeping and  controversial statute originally created to fight the Mafia. Chevron’s case rested in large part on Guerra’s since-recanted corruption claims; Donziger and his codefendants denied the charges.</p><p>唐齐格一生中都在与看似无穷无尽的诉讼作斗争。2011年，雪佛龙在美国一家法院起诉唐齐格和诉讼成员，要求赔偿6000万美元的损失，指控他们敲诈勒索，并援引了最初为打击黑手党而制定的一项广泛而有争议的法规。雪佛龙的案子在很大程度上取决于格拉，因为他放弃了腐败指控；Donziger和他的共同被告否认了这些指控。</p><p> “The approach of accusing victims’ attorneys of being fraudsters has been honed with particular energy by [the] law firm Gibson Dunn,” Bloomberg  noted in 2014. Shortly before the suit went to trial, Chevron dropped the demand for monetary damages, thus denying Donziger the right to a jury trial.</p><p>布隆伯格在2014年指出：“吉布森·邓恩（Gibson Dunn）律师事务所对指控受害者律师为欺诈者的做法进行了特别的努力。”。在诉讼开庭前不久，雪佛龙放弃了金钱赔偿的要求，从而剥夺了唐齐格接受陪审团审判的权利。</p><p> During the suit, which Chevron won, the company demanded that Donziger turn over his phone and computer to their legal team. After Donziger refused, arguing that doing so would violate attorney-client privilege, the judge in the case charged him with criminal contempt of court.</p><p>在雪佛龙胜诉的诉讼中，该公司要求Donziger将他的手机和电脑交给他们的法律团队。在Donziger拒绝后，他辩称这样做会侵犯律师-客户特权，本案法官指控他藐视法庭罪。</p><p> The US attorney’s office  declined to prosecute Donziger for contempt, so the judge in the case made the  extraordinary move of appointing a private law firm to represent the government in prosecuting Donziger – a development that two US senators have  called “highly unusual” and “concerning”. The senators also noted that the firm appointed to prosecute Donziger  previously represented Chevron.</p><p>美国检察官办公室拒绝以藐视法庭罪起诉唐齐格，因此本案法官采取了不同寻常的行动，任命了一家私人律师事务所代表政府起诉唐齐格——两名美国参议员称这一事态发展“极不寻常”且“令人担忧”。参议员们还指出，被任命起诉Donziger的公司此前曾代表雪佛龙。</p><p> Because he was deemed a “flight risk”, Donziger spent more than 800 days under house detention, with an electronic ankle bracelet, while awaiting the outcome of the trial. In 2020, according to  the Intercept’s Sharon Lerner, Donziger’s “bank accounts have been frozen. He now has a lien on his apartment, faces exorbitant fines, and has been prohibited from earning money. As of August [2019], a court has  seized his passport and put him on house arrest. Chevron, which has a market capitalization of $228bn, has the funds to continue targeting Donziger for as long as it chooses.”</p><p>因为他被认为有“逃跑风险”，唐齐格在等待审判结果的同时，带着一个电子脚踝手镯被软禁了800多天。据Intercept的Sharon Lerner称，2020年，Donziger的“银行账户已被冻结。他现在对公寓拥有留置权，面临高额罚款，并被禁止赚钱。截至2019年8月]一家法院扣押了他的护照，并将他软禁起来。雪佛龙的市值为2280亿美元，只要它愿意，它就有资金继续瞄准Donziger。"</p><p> Donziger eventually lost the contempt case, which he called a “charade”. As a consequence of the charges against him, he also lost his law license –  against the recommendation of the judicial officer who refereed the professional conduct hearing. The officer, a former federal prosecutor,  described Donziger as a stubborn gadfly who is “often his own worst enemy” but called the move to disbar him unjustified, and decried the “extent of his pursuit by Chevron” as “extravagant, unnecessary and punitive.”</p><p>唐齐格最终败诉，他称之为“猜谜”。由于对他的指控，他还失去了律师执照——这是对主持职业操守听证会的司法官员的建议。这位曾担任联邦检察官的官员形容唐齐格是一个顽固的牛虻，“往往是他自己最大的敌人”，但称解散他的举动没有道理，并谴责“雪佛龙对他的追捕程度”是“奢侈、不必要和惩罚性的”</p><p> In October, Donziger  reported to a federal prison to begin a six-month contempt sentence. (In December he was  returned to home detention as part of a Covid-related early-release program.) He still cannot make a living as a lawyer, cannot collect any legal fees from the Ecuador judgment, and had to wear an electronic ankle bracelet  until last weekend.</p><p>10月，Donziger向联邦监狱报案，开始了为期六个月的藐视法庭判决。（12月，作为与新冠病毒相关的提前释放计划的一部分，他被送回了家庭拘留所。）他仍然无法以律师为生，无法从厄瓜多尔的判决中收取任何法律费用，直到上周末，他还不得不佩戴电子脚踝手镯。</p><p> In November, nine members of US Congress signed a letter  calling Donziger’s treatment “unprecedented and unjust imprisonment”.  International judicial monitors,  lawyers’ associations, members of  European parliament, and Amnesty International have also  criticized the charges against Donziger as excessive and punitive, and 29 Nobel laureates from around the world signed an  open letter arguing that Donziger is a victim of “judicial harassment”.</p><p>11月，九名美国国会议员签署了一封信，称唐齐格的待遇是“前所未有的、不公正的监禁”。国际司法监督员、律师协会、欧洲议会议员和国际特赦组织也批评了对唐齐格的指控，认为这些指控过于严厉和惩罚性，来自世界各地的29位诺贝尔奖获得者签署了一封公开信，称唐齐格是“司法骚扰”的受害者。</p><p> I’ve dealt with similar cases myself, with different companies. In 1993, I was part of a team that filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of 650 plaintiffs against PG&amp;E, alleging that the California utility company knew that harmful chemicals, particularly hexavalent chromium, were seeping into groundwater in Hinkley, California, and contaminating the town’s water supply. That case ultimately resulted in the largest medical settlement lawsuit in history at that time and changed my life.</p><p>我自己也曾在不同的公司处理过类似的案件。1993年，我加入了一个团队，代表650名原告对PG&amp；E、 声称加州公用事业公司知道有害化学物质，特别是六价铬，正在渗入加州欣克利的地下水，并污染该镇的供水。那起案件最终导致了当时历史上最大的医疗和解诉讼，改变了我的生活。</p><p> After Hinkley, we discovered other towns nearby in California where hexavalent chromium was causing health problems and wreaking havoc on lives. In 2006, PG&amp;E agreed to pay  another $295m to settle a series of lawsuits over contaminated water affecting another 1,100 people.</p><p>在欣克利之后，我们发现了加利福尼亚州附近的其他城镇，那里的六价铬造成了健康问题，给人们的生活造成了严重破坏。2006年，PG&amp；E同意再支付2.95亿美元，以解决一系列涉及1100人的污水诉讼。</p><p> Imagine if instead of a movie telling my story, I’d gone to jail. That’s essentially what has happened to Steve Donziger. And, since this litigation started in 1993, Chevron has  not paid a cent or performed any cleanup. So far the only people who have paid for Chevron’s alleged behavior are Donziger and those affected by the contamination – the poor and indigenous Ecuadorians who continue to  live every day with the pollution’s effects.</p><p>想象一下，如果不是一部讲述我故事的电影，我进了监狱。史蒂夫·唐齐格就是这样。而且，自1993年这起诉讼开始以来，雪佛龙没有支付一分钱，也没有进行任何清理。到目前为止，唯一为雪佛龙的所谓行为买单的人是Donziger和那些受污染影响的人——穷人和土著厄瓜多尔人，他们继续每天生活在污染的影响之下。</p><p> Erin Brockovich is an environmental advocate and author of the book  Superman’s Not Coming: Our National Water Crisis and What We the People Can Do About It.
