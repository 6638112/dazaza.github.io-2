Each modality\u2019s augmentations are contained within its own sub-library. These sub-libraries include both function-based and class-based transforms, composition operators, and have the option to provide metadata about the transform applied, including its intensity.\n AugLy is a great library to utilize for augmenting your data in model training, or to evaluate the robustness gaps of your model! We designed AugLy to include many specific data augmentations that users perform in real life on internet platforms like Facebook&#39;s -- for example making an image into a meme, overlaying text/emojis on images/videos, reposting a screenshot from social media. While AugLy contains more generic data augmentations as well, it will be particularly useful to you if you&#39;re working on a problem like copy detection, hate speech detection, or copyright infringement where these &#34;internet user&#34; types of data augmentations are prelevant.\n  To see more examples of augmentations, open the Colab notebooks in the README for each modality! (e.g. image  README &amp;  Colab)\n        Or clone AugLy if you want to be able to run our unit tests, contribute a pull request, etc:\n git clone git@github.com:facebookresearch/AugLy.git[Optional, but recommended] conda create -n augly  &amp;&amp; conda activate augly  &amp;&amp; conda install pippip install -e AugLy/\n NOTE: In some environments,  pip doesn&#39;t install  python-magic as expected. In that case, you will need to additionally run:\n       We provide various media assets to use with some of our augmentations.

All Noto fonts are published under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.\n Screenshot Templates - Images created by a designer at Facebook specifically to use with AugLy.

", "note_en": "In the database field and information retrieval in general, there is a very common scenario. I have a list of (sorted) integers that I want to store, and I want to do that in an as efficient a manner as possible. There are dozens of methods to do this and this is a hot topic for research. This is so useful because there are so many places where you can operate on a sorted integer list and gain massive benefits. Unlike generic compression routines, we can usually take advantage of the fact that we understand the data we are trying to work with and get better results.\n The reason I need to compress integers (actually, int64 values) is that I\u2019m trying to keep track of matches for some data, so the integers that I\u2019m tracking are actually file offsets for user\u2019s data inside of Voron. That lead to a few different scenarios that I have to deal with:\n  I\u2019m trying to figure out what is the best way to store the later two options in as efficient manner as possible.\n The first stop was  Daniel Lemire\u2019s blog, naturally, since he has wrote about this extensively. I looked at the following schemes: FastPFor and StreamVByte. They have somewhat different purposes, but basically, FastPFor is using a bits stream while StreamVByte is using byte oriented mode. Theoretically speaking, you can get better compression rate from FastPFor, but StreamVByte is supposed to be faster. Another integer compression system come from the Gorilla paper from Facebook, that is a bigger scheme, which include time series values compression. However, part of that scheme talks about how you can compress integers (they use that to store the ticks of a particular operation). We are actually using that for the time series support inside of RavenDB.\n I\u2019m not going to cover that in depth, here  is the paper on Gorilla compression, the relevant description is at section 4.1.1. Suffice to say that they are using a bit stream and delta of deltas computation. Basically, if you keep getting values that are the same distance apart, you don\u2019t need to record all the value, you can compute that naturally. In the best case scenario, Gorilla compression needs a single bit per value, assuming the results are spaced similarly.\n For my purpose, I want to get as high a compression rate as possible, and I need to store just the list of integers. The problem with Gorilla compression is that if we  aren\u2019t getting numbers that are the same distance apart, we need to record the  amount that they are different. That means that at a minimum, we\u2019ll need a minimum of 9 bits  per value. That adds up quickly, sadly.\n On the other hand, with PFor, there is a different system. PFor computes the maximum number of bits required for a  batch of integer, and then record just those values. I found the Binary Packing section (2.6) in  this paper to be the clearest explanation on how that works exactly.\u00a0 The problem with PFor, however, is that if you have a single large outlier, you\u2019ll waste a lot of bits unnecessarily.\n I decided to see if I can do something about that and created an encoder that works on batches of 128 integers at a time. This encoder will:\n Check the maximum number of bits required to record the  deltas of the integers. That along already saves us a lot.\n Then we check the top and bottom halves of the batch, to see if we\u2019ll get a benefit from recording them separately. A single large value (or a group of them) that is localized to a part of the batch will be recorded independently in this case.\n Finally, instead of only recording the meaningful bit ranges, we\u2019ll also analyze the batch we get further. The idea is to try to find ranges within the batch that have the same distance from one another. We can encode those as repetitions instead of each independent value. That can end up saving a surprisingly amount of space.\n You can look at the results of  my research here. I\u2019ll caution you that this is raw, but the results are promising. I\u2019m able to beat (in terms of compression rate) the standard PFor implementation by a bit, with a  lot less code.\n I\u2019m also looking at a compression rate of 30% \u2013 40% for realistic data sets. And if the data is setup just right and I\u2019m able to take advantage of the repeated delta optimization, I can pack things  real tight.\n Currently numbers say that I can push upward of 10,000 int64 values in an 8KB buffer without any repeated deltas. It goes to just under 500,000 int64 values in an 8KB buffer if I can take full advantage of the deltas.\n The reason I mention the delta so often, it is very likely that I\u2019ll record values that are roughly the same size, so we\u2019ll get offsets that are the same space from one another. In that case, my encoder goes to town and the compression rate is basically crazy.\n This is a  small piece of a much larger work, but this is the first time in a while that I got to code at Voron\u2019s level.

[1] The extreme temperatures in Antarctica \rnecessitated large amounts of fuel oil to maintain operations, making \rthe prospect of nuclear power, an attractive alternative. [1] During its \r10 year lifetime, the nuclear power station produced over 78 million \rkilowatt hours of electricity and produced 13 million gallons of fresh \rwater using the excess steam in a desalination plant. [1] Though this \rdevice reduced the necessity for fuel imports, it was plagued with \rproblems which ultimately forced its early retirement in 1972. The cost \rassociated with nuclear power in the Antarctic made it impractical, and \rdiesel-electric generators have since powered the base. [1] The PM-3A \rnuclear reactor that powered McMurdo Station stands as the only nuclear \rpower station to operate on the Antarctic continent.\n    The ice-free southern tip of the Hut Point Peninsula \ron Ross Island in Antarctica has a history of over 100 years of \rexploration and scientific history and is the site of the present day \rMcMurdo Station. [2] This site is located just 729 nautical miles from \rthe South Pole and is where Robert F. Scott staged the first expedition \rto the South Pole in 1902. [2] The United States established a permanent \rbase at this site beginning in December 1955 as part of Operation Deep \rFreeze I. [2] Known as Naval Air Facility McMurdo, this site was to \rserve as a sea port and logistics base from which to build and support a \rresearch facility at the geographic South Pole. [2] The name McMurdo was \rchosen to honour a lieutenant on the British ship HMS Terror that \rdiscovered Ross Island on an Antarctic expedition in 1841. [2] In 1958, \rthe site was renamed to McMurdo Station and has since maintained the \rability to support a population of over 1200 people. [2] McMurdo Station \rserves as the hub for activity in the Antarctic and is currently \roperated by the United States Antarctic Program (USAP), a division of \rthe Nation Science Foundation (NSF). [2]\n      The decision to install a nuclear power station at \rMcMurdo station was based on several factors. [3] First, there were \rdifficulties associated with supplying the large fuel demands required \rfor operations. Aircraft, diesel-electric generators, heating units, and \rvarious types of land vehicles consumed fuel in excess of half of the \rtotal freight delivered to Antarctica in the late 1950s. [3] To further \rcomplicate supply chain logistics, McMurdo can only be accessed by \rsupply ships during the aural summer months (summer in the southern \rhemisphere), thus requiring all supplies for the entire year to be \rdelivered during this short time frame. [3] It was concluded that an \rincreased supply of electricity from nuclear power would give rise to a \rmore efficient use of freight, reduced costs, as well as electric \rheating to replace the fire hazards associated with oil-fired heating \runits. [3] In addition, experience would be gained from installing and \roperating a nuclear power plant in an isolated and harsh environment. \r[3]\n  In August 1960, the United States Congress authorized \rthe design and construction of a nuclear reactor for McMurdo. [3] That \rsame month, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission contracted the Martin \rMarietta Company of Baltimore, Maryland to design, fabricate, test, \rpackage, transport, install, and initially operate the PM-3A (A for \rAntarctic) nuclear reactor on site in Antarctica. [4] The PM-3A reactor \ris a portable, medium sized nuclear reactor, the third of its type. [4] \rTwo others of this type were built and fielded prior to the PM-3A. [4] \rThe first was the PM-1, also built by Martin, which was used to power a \rremote radar station in Wyoming as part of the North American Aerospace \rDefense Command (NORAD). [4] The PM-2A (A for Arctic) was built by the \rAmerican Locomotive Company to power the remote US military base known \ras Camp Century setup in Northern Greenland. [4] Each of these reactors \rwas in the 1.25-2.0 MW power range, PM-1 and PM-3A were operational by \r1962, with PM-2A being operational in 1960. [4]\n    Fig. 3: Components of the PM-3A arriving at McMurdo. \r (Source:  United States\r Antartcia Program. Courtesy of the\r  NSF)\n  The PM-3A nuclear reactor was above all meant to be \rportable as it was designed with the LC-130 aircraft in mind as its \rdelivery system. [3] Although McMurdo is accessible by ship, it was \roriginally thought that this reactor would power bases inland such as \rthat located at the South Pole which are accessible only by aircraft. \r[3] For reliability and transportability reasons, the PM-3A was designed \rto be a pressurized water reactor. [3] Its core utilized highly enriched \ruranium, 93.1% in relative amount of the isotope U-235, whose fuel \rassembly was roughly the size of an oil drum. [5] Fig. 2 shows the \rinstallation of the PM-3A core onsite. The reactor arrived in modules at \rMcMurdo in December of 1961 by way of the USNS Arneb. [3] Fig. 3 shows \rone of the nuclear reactor modules being unloaded at McMurdo. The PM-3A \rwas assembled on a foundation of solid volcanic rock at an altitude of \r300 feet on the side of Observation Hill, a site that overlooks McMurdo \rStation. [3] Fig. 4 shows the completed reactor site overlooking McMurdo \rStation.\n  The PM-3A was operated by the Naval Nuclear \rPropulsion Unit consisting of a crew of 25. [3] The reactor went \rcritical in March of 1962 and supplied useful electricity to McMurdo in \rJuly of 1962. [3] It took a total of 23 months to complete testing and \rdebugging of the PM-3A nuclear plant. [3] After this time, control of \rthe plant was turned over from the Martin Company to the US Navy. [3] \rOnce fully operational, the role of the plant was twofold, to produce \relectricity for McMurdo in the amount of 1.8 MW as well as to produce \rsteam to operate a desalination plant for the production fresh drinking \rwater in the amount of 14,000 gallons per day. [3]\n    With a total of 438 malfunctions during its \roperational lifetime from 1964 to 1972, the reactor at McMurdo proved to \rbe an unreliable source of power generation, available only 72% of the \rtime. [1] Because of this, in May of 1972, it was determined by an \rindependent assessment from the Bechtel Corporation that the PM-3A was \rnot cost effective and that replacement with modern diesel-electric \rgenerators would require less staff and would also be more reliable. [1] \rIn September 1972, the PM-3A was shut down for routine maintenance and \rinspection. [1] It was determined that conditions existed in the system \rfor chloride stress corrosion cracking, a situation where sudden failure \rcan occur in normally ductile materials under tension in a corrosive \renvironment. [1,6] Inspection of a an accessible section of pipe \rrevealed no incidences of this occurring, however, the Navy refused to \rrule out cracking on surfaces which could not be inspected and thus \rcalled for a full dismantling and inspection of the reactor before it \rcould be deemed safe. [1] The cost associated with this full inspection \rand possible repair of reactor components was a major factor in the \rdecision to decommission the plant. [1]\n    After 10 years of operation, the PM-3A was \rpermanently shut down in 1972, achieving only half of the expected \rdesign life of 20 years. [1] The next step was clean up of the reactor \rsite. The PM-3A and generated radioactive waste could not remain at \rMcMurdo due to the internationally agreed upon Antarctic Treaty which \rprevents both nuclear weapons testing as well as nuclear waste dumping \rin the Antarctic. [7] As such, a large-scale effort was undertaken to \rremove the reactor components, buildings, and contaminated soil for a \rtotal of 365 metric tons of radioactive waste to the continental United \rStates. [7] It was later determined that there were indeed cracks in the \rcontainment vessel which leaked coolant water into the crushed gravel \rthat had been used as the reactor shield which is what resulted in such \ra large area of contamination. [4] As such, more than 9000 cubic meters \rof contaminated soil was relocated to the continental US. [1] In total, \rseven enriched uranium fuel cores were shipped to McMurdo, three of \rwhich had yet to be used as the plant was expected to operate for \rseveral more years. [7] The reactor cores, components, and highly \rradioactive gravel that was used to shield the reactor were shipped to \rthe Department of Energy Savannah River Plant in South Carolina. [1] The \rremaining low-level contaminated soil was shipped to the Naval base at \rPort Hueneme, California. [1] The clean up operation lasted until 1979 \ras work on the site could be performed only during the austral summer. \r[7]\n    As a result of the multiple malfunctions of the PM-3A \ras well as it&#39;s clean up activities, there have been concerns that the \rhealth of personnel involved with the reactor may have been adversely \raffected. [7] Although members of the Navy Nuclear Propulsion Unit were \rcontinuously monitored for radiation, many of the military support crew \rwere not. [7] As such, a study was undertaken by the Department of \rDefense to estimate an upper bound on radiation exposure for these \rindividuals based on the worst cases of the available data from McMurdo. \r[7] Levels of radioactivity in the water were monitored once the PM-3A \rwas used in the production of drinking water. [7] During the first few \ryears of fresh water production (between 1967 and 1969) there were \rseveral instances of abnormally high amounts of tritium in the drinking \rwater. [7] In addition, there was a case of abnormally high amounts of \rlong-lived beta activity in the drinking water in 1969. [7]\n    In addition to problems with the drinking water and \renvironmental contamination, there were several recorded instances of \rcrew radiation exposure, some resulting in injury. [7] During the plant \roperation, 223 reports of abnormal levels of radiation were recorded. \r[7] Of these cases, 14 resulted in injury and 123 resulted in exposure \rin the amount of 0.350 rem over a period of 7 days. [7] This is a \rsubstantial amount of radiation when it is estimated that, one average, \ra typical yearly dose from background sources is 0.240 rem. [8] The \rremaining 86 instances were abnormal radiation levels detected within \rthe plant and its immediate surroundings. [7] The conclusion was that a \rsupport member would have received a maximum dose of 0.2 to 0.6 rem to \rthe thyroid or 0.2 to 0.5 rem to the red bone marrow per austral summer \rtour. [7] The upper bound here is equivalent a typical radiation dosage \rreceived by a person living in the United States from typical background \rradiation and medical procedures. [7] It is, however, recognized that \rthere were personnel who may have been exposed to radiation outside the \rconfines of factors and data considered in those figures that may be \religible for compensation. [7] In addition, the estimated dose above \rdoes not include members who were part of the decommissioning procedures \rwho may have inhaled or ingested contaminated particles. [7]\n    The nuclear reactor installed at McMurdo Station was \rthe first and only to operate on the Antarctic continent. It operated \rfor 10 years and greatly reduced the need for fossil fuels in the \rAntarctic. Although it was initially thought to be a cost saving device, \rits unreliability, large operational crew, and large clean up proved it \rto be an expensive experiment.

People who claim this have fallen for Brave\u2019s marketing strategy which consists on telling lies and flawed arguments.\n I\u2019ll give you numerous facts and counter-arguments that will prevent yourself from falling for Brave\u2019s lies.\n   One of the biggest Brave\u2019s selling points is their built-in adblocker. But let me tell you a couple of things about Brave\u2019s adblocker:\n Their adblocker is just a fork of uBlock Origin, which isn\u2019t necessarily bad. The problem comes when you realise that  it has a hardcoded whitelist. They\u2019re   whitelisting trackers from Facebook and Twitter, so they can use scripts in third parties&#39; websites to track you across the web. This was their response:\n Loading a script from an edge-cache does not track a user without third-party cookies or equivalent browser-local storage, which Brave always blocks and always will block. In other words, sending requests and receiving responses without cookies or other means of identifying users does not necessarily create a tracking threat.\n This is completely false. They\u2019re blatantly lying to their users. Anyone who knows a bit about how JavaScript works and it\u2019s capacities to track you without the need of using cookies will be laughing after reading that.\n Using Facebook\u2019s and Twitter\u2019s scripts is more than enough to track and identify you. Blocking cookies doesn\u2019t help.\n I mean, what\u2019s the point on making a \u201cprivate\u201d browser if Facebook\u2019s scripts (that are everywhere btw) will track you?\n Another problem with their built-in adblocker is that it\u2019s better for extensions to be separated from the core of the browser, since they don\u2019t follow each other\u2019s update cycles.  This means that you need to update the entire browser to fix a bug in the adblocker. Stupid, isn\u2019t it?\n Another reason to avoid using Brave is that   uBlock Origin works best on Firefox and there isn\u2019t anything that Brave can do about it.\n The limitations are Chromium\u2019s fault and Google isn\u2019t going to do anything about it. Brave is dependent on Google and they\u2019ll always be limited by this fact. Since they\u2019re based on Google\u2019s browser and web engine, Google takes development decisions over the 95% of Brave. It\u2019s important to bring focus to the fact that  Brave isn\u2019t more than Chromium with another skin and a built-in adblocker with reduced functionality.\n Other side effect of using a browser which is made by Google is that  Google will take decisions that benefit their advertisement business, like   making impossible to use adblockers on any Chromium based browser. And of course, this will affect Brave.\n However, of course that  they won\u2019t tell you anything of this on their homepage. Part of their marketing strategy consists on making their \u201cprivacy shield\u201d look like the best and unrivaled adblocker in the world, when it is just a really limited uBlock Origin, with a hardcoded whitelist.\n  Rewards is their shitty program that will replace ads displayed on websites with their own. They claim that you can earn money with it. Well, they aren\u2019t lying to you on this. If earning half a penny in a month is okay for you, in exchange of your privacy, because of course, they\u2019re tracking you with Rewards, then enjoy your money. But remember, Brave\u2019s fee is 30% of your earnings.\n If you don\u2019t mind that and you decide to use Rewards, it\u2019s important to say that Rewards uses Uphold, which has an excellent policy /s:\n To verify your identity, we collect your name, address, phone, email, and other similar information. We may also require you to provide additional Personal Data for verification purposes, including your date of birth, taxpayer or government identification number, or a copy of your government-issued identification\n Uphold uses Veriff to verify your identity by determining whether a selfie you take matches the photo in your government-issued identification. Veriff\u2019s facial recognition technology collects information from your photos that may include biometric data, and when you provide your selfie, you will be asked to agree that Veriff may process biometric data and other data (including special categories of data) from the photos you submit and share it with Uphold. Automated processes may be used to make a verification decision.\n Contrary to popular belief, Rewards isn\u2019t opt in. Don\u2019t believe me? Check it yourself.  Brave will recurrently make requests to the following domains, no matter if you use Rewards or not:\n  The names can be a bit confusing but these domains aren\u2019t just for updates and  they fetch affiliates for Brave Rewards, with pings such as Grammarly, Softonic, Uphold, etc.\n So  despite explicitly opting out, Brave\u2019s Rewards will still be used to track you.\n  They also make requests to various domains that are believed to be related to the crypto aspect of Rewards. I won\u2019t elaborate here since it\u2019s better explained on  this article. Here you have a list with the different domains that Brave sends a request to:\n   It is also worth mentioning that  Brave has built-in telemetry.  Brave will make a ton of requests to the domain p3a.brave.com as telemetry. This telemetry can be opted out, but a lot of people believe in their marketing and think that Brave is private out of the box.\n  brave-core-ext.s3.brave.com fetches 5 extensions and installs them. It is said that this might be a backdoor. But I don\u2019t want to get conspiracist. I prefer giving you verifiable facts. I\u2019ll limit myself to inform you about suspicious activities.\n  There is a ton of criticism about Firefox\u2019s Pocket. But Brave has something similar, which is called Brave Today.\n It is displayed in every blank tab. This feature sends lots of requests to Brave\u2019s servers.  It can\u2019t be disabled.\n So your only option would be setting the tabs to blank, but you\u2019ll still have this shady crap enabled. At least on Firefox you can easily disable Pocket.\n  This features is intended to \u201cprotect\u201d the user from \u201cunsafe\u201d websites and extensions. However, it seems to have a contrary effect, since  it sends requests to fetch the information required And it wouldn\u2019t be too far-fetched of Brave  to use Google\u2019s SafeBrowsing. I\u2019ll elaborate on the next section.\n  Brave makes requests to static1.brave.com. If you put this on a browser you\u2019ll find that it was directed to Google\u2019s error 404 page.\n Isn\u2019t it weird that one of Brave\u2019s domains redirects to a Google\u2019s page? Well, curl \u2013head static1.brave.com shows that  Brave uses Google\u2019s gstatic, which is btw using Cloudflare.\n It\u2019s a concerning issue for a \u201cprivacy\u201d oriented browser to connect to Cloudflare\u2019s and Google\u2019s domains, since both of them are telemetry.\n  Well, you have to understand that security and privacy are different things. Anyway, It is true that Chromium has process isolation. However, Firefox is almost there too. It\u2019s known as the Project Fission. You can already enable it on the about:config with fission.autostart (on nightly). Take into account that it\u2019s still under development.\n Process isolation is the only advantage in security that chromium has over Firefox right now and it will not help you with privacy. You may even want to enable Fission if you feel like process isolation is a must have.\n  Brave will check for updates every time you run it.  You can\u2019t turn it off, which implies that Brave\u2019ll make this request every time you launch the browser. Brave\u2019s dedication to privacy is truly amazing /s.\n  Okay, we\u2019ve seen how Brave is everything but private. But I\u2019d still like to list you some of the shady practices they\u2019ve been caught doing in the past, just in case there is someone who still thinks that using Brave is a good idea.\n  In June 2020, a twitter user (@cryptonator1337) discovered that  Brave was automatically injecting referral codes into URLs for cryptocurrency exchange sites.\n So if you typed \u201cbinance.us\u201d into the URL bar and pressed enter, Brave would take you to \u201cbinance.us/?ref=35089877\u201d.\n There was a huge scandal when this was noted. Later, Brave disabled this in the code, in a \u201csorry we got caught\u201d style.\n  I\u2019ve already shown you how Uphold is everything but privacy respecting.  It wouldn\u2019t make any sense for a \u201cprivacy friendly\u201d browser to use such a service, unless they didn\u2019t give a fuck about privacy and everything was just a marketing strategy\u2026\n  Who the fuck implements Tor but doesn\u2019t change the DNS? I mean, this is either total incompetence or, even worse, malevolence on the part of Brave\u2019s team.\n   Brave have been accused of  scamming people. They\u2019ve been promoting this on their home screen, since they get up to $200 per user that uses their affiliate link. I consider this a scam since they\u2019re making a ton of profit from people who will lose their money.  They removed the Reddit post exposing this and the issue on Github.\n They were also accused of theft with BAT but this isn\u2019t verifiable so I\u2019ll only link the  source for you.\n  You may have seen in the past a fork of Brave which removed telemetry and other shady practices from Brave. It was called Braver.\n Well, that project was given countless lawsuits by Brave, they were forced to rename the project and finally they had to give up out of fear.\n So, after all, it seems that  being free software, or as they prefer to call it, \u201copen source\u201d,  is just another marketing strategy.\n They don\u2019t care at all about software freedom and when someone forks their browser and make one that doesn\u2019t spy on their users, they will harass them until the fork dies, since people using forks aren\u2019t profitable. They want you to use Brave so they can sell your data, force you to use affiliate links and take a 30% cut of your \u201crewards\u201d.\n  I think that at this point it\u2019s clear that Brave doesn\u2019t care about users&#39; privacy, they only care about making money. But there is something that I haven\u2019t talked about. It\u2019s the fact that Brave is supporting Google\u2019s web monopoly.\n Why? How? Well, the answer is pretty simple: Brave is just another Chromium skin. So at the end, when using Brave or any other Chromium based browser, you\u2019re giving marketshare to Google and supporting their evil web empire.\n The only browser that does not use Google\u2019s web engine (blink)  is Firefox. So if you really want some kind of privacy I\u2019d recommend you switching to Firefox or something Firefox based, like GNU Icecat, since a Google\u2019s monopoly on the browsers market can\u2019t be good for anyone, even if you love Chromium, it is known that monopolies are extremely negative.\n And as I mentioned before,  this is already happening with Google trying to destroy adblockers. What will be next? Forcing every Chromium browser to use FLOC? Making it impossible to disable JavaScript? We don\u2019t know it yet, but depending on the biggest data miner and advertisement company (Google) development decisions doesn\u2019t seem a great idea if you want to have some kind of privacy.\n  You shouldn\u2019t trust Brave at all. The smart move would be switching to  hardened Firefox, GNU Icecat, Palemoon or the Tor browser.\n If you have any counter-argument, any other info that I could add to the blog post or anything to say about it, you can reach me on the fediverse.\n   &gt;&gt; Home", "posttime": "2021-06-18 21:07:16", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u9519\u8bef,false", "title": "\u52c7\u6562\uff0c\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u611f\u89c9 ", "title_en": "Brave, the false sensation of privacy", "transed": 1, "url": "http://ebin.city/%7Ewerwolf/posts/brave-is-shit/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9519\u8bef", "false"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "85eef9feb4631daca7a8e01470161dd5.png", "infoid": 1066695, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4ece\u7eaf\u7cb9\u7684\u5b66\u79d1\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a33\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u4ece\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u8bc1\u660e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u5b9e\u73b0\u662f\u8be5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u5e76\u4e0d\u5bb9\u6613\u63d0\u4f9b\u7f29\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6216\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8fc7\u6e21\u9700\u8981\u514b\u670d\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u6574\u5408\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fd9\u91cc\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u4fdd\u7f57\u9677\u9631\u4e2d\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e40 CA +\u5149\u5b66\u8ddd\u79bb\u768419\u82f1\u5bf8\u673a\u67b6\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8bb8\u591a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u673a\u68b0\uff0c\u5149\u5b66\u548c\u7535\u6c14\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5806\u6808\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u8bbf\u95ee\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ad9\u70b9\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u5355\u53cd\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5bfb\u5740\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f20\u9012\u7684M\u00f8lmer-s\u00f8rensen\u4ea4\u4e92\u4ecb\u5bfc\u7684\u7f20\u7ed3\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6b64\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u751f\u4ea7\u6700\u5927\u7f20\u7ed5\u7684\u7eff\u9e42-Horne-Zeininger\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u8fbe24\u4e2a\u79bb\u7ebf\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f;\u4e0e\u6210\u719f\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u76f8\u63d0\u5e76\u8bba\u3002\n  12\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u7269\u7406\u793e\u4f1a\u4e0a\u53d1\u8868\u768412.0\u7a0e\u6536\u6761\u6b3e4.0\u56fd\u9645\u8bb8\u53ef\u3002\u6b64\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u914d\u5fc5\u987b\u7ef4\u6301\u5411\u4f5c\u8005\u548c\u5df2\u53d1\u8868\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\u548c\u7b2c39\u6761\u7684\u6807\u9898\uff0c\u671f\u520a\u5f15\u6587\u548cDOI\u5f52\u5c5e\u3002\n   \u00d7\n     \u6ca1\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u83b7\u5f97\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u8bb8\u53ef\u6216\u5176\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u6839\u636e\u521b\u610f\u516c\u51714.0\u56fd\u9645\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u7684\u6761\u6b3e\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002\u5982\u679c\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u5141\u8bb8\u4efb\u4f55\u5a92\u4f53\u7684\u65e0\u9650\u5236\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u53d1\uff0c\u5b89\u5fb7\u751f\u4ea7\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4ea4\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f52\u5c5e\u5df2\u53d1\u8868\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\uff06\uff0339;\u51a0\u519b\uff0c\u671f\u520a\u5f15\u6587\u548cDoi\u4ee4\u4eba\u7740\u8ff7\u3002\u8bf7\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u6570\u5b57\u53ef\u80fd\u5df2\u88ab\u5176\u4ed6\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u7eb3\u5165\u666e\u53ca\u3002\u60a8\u7684\u8d23\u4efb\u662f\u5728\u804c\u6743\u6301\u6709\u4eba\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u8bb8\u53ef\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u7533\u8bf7\u3002\n \u00d7 ", "note_en": "Quantum information processing is steadily progressing from a purely academic discipline towards applications throughout science and industry. Transitioning from lab-based, proof-of-concept experiments to robust, integrated realizations of quantum information processing hardware is an important step in this process. However, the nature of traditional laboratory setups does not offer itself readily to scaling up system sizes or allow for applications outside of laboratory-grade environments. This transition requires overcoming challenges in engineering and integration without sacrificing the state-of-the-art performance of laboratory implementations. Here, we present a 19-inch rack quantum computing demonstrator based on     40  Ca + optical qubits in a linear Paul trap to address many of these challenges. We outline the mechanical, optical, and electrical subsystems. Furthermore, we describe the automation and remote access components of the quantum computing stack. We conclude by describing characterization measurements relevant to quantum computing including site-resolved single-qubit interactions, and entangling operations mediated by the M\u00f8lmer-S\u00f8rensen interaction delivered via two distinct addressing approaches. Using this setup, we produce maximally entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states with up to 24 ions without the use of postselection or error mitigation techniques; on par with well-established conventional laboratory setups.\n  12 More   Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.
