For Southpaws themselves — the affectionate term for lefties — this biological peculiarity has been everything from a source of stigma to a point of pride. But at the heart of it remains an evolutionary mystery — one that  Wired contributing editor  David Wolman, himself (but of course) a lefty, sets out to investigate in    A Left-Hand Turn Around the World: Chasing the Mystery and Meaning of All Things Southpaw (  public library).</p><p>为什么有些人类是左撇子，包括柏拉图、查尔斯·达尔文、卡尔·萨根、黛比·米尔曼、斯蒂芬·杰伊·古尔德、诺姆·乔姆斯基和阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦等著名的标本，这个问题几个世纪以来一直困扰着科学家。对左撇子本身--左撇子的亲切称谓--来说，这种生物学特性从耻辱的来源到引以为豪，应有尽有。但它的核心仍然是一个进化之谜--“连线”特约编辑大卫·沃尔曼(David Wolman)本人(当然也是左撇子)在“左转世界：追逐一切事物南爪(公共图书馆)的奥秘和意义”一书中展开了调查。</p><p> Wolman, who spoke about the oddity of handedness in a fantastic recent   Radiolab episode about conflict, traces 200 years of biological and psychological perplexity as he scours the world for answers, from a Parisian science museum that houses pioneering French surgeon and scholar Paul Broca’s bottled brains to a castle in Scotland that hides clues to the heritability of left-handedness to the neuroscience labs of Berkeley to the golf courses of Japan.</p><p>沃尔曼在最近一集关于冲突的奇妙Radiolab节目中谈到了左撇子的奇怪之处，他在全世界搜寻答案的过程中追溯了200年来生物和心理上的困惑，从巴黎的科学博物馆(存放法国先驱外科医生和学者保罗·布罗卡(Paul Broca)的瓶装大脑)到苏格兰的城堡(该城堡隐藏着左撇子的遗传性线索)，再到伯克利的神经科学实验室，再到日本的高尔夫球场。</p><p> To be sure, a Southpaw wasn’t always a mere scientific curiosity, let alone the “lefty superiority complex” which Wolman both notes and embodies — for centuries, it was the subject of superstition, which bestowed upon its owner a serious social curse. Wolman writes:</p><p>可以肯定的是，左撇子并不总是仅仅是科学上的好奇，更不用说沃尔曼既注意到又体现的“左撇子优越感”-几个世纪以来，它一直是迷信的主题，这给它的主人带来了严重的社会诅咒。沃尔曼写道：</p><p> In the Western world, left-handedness has long been associated with the worst of the worst: sin, devil worship, Satan himself, and just an all-around bad position with God. Catholic schoolteachers used to tell students that left-handedness was “the mark of the Beast,” the Scots say a person with terrible luck must have been baptized by a left-handed priest, and orthodox Jews wrap their left arms in the leather strap of  tefillin as if to say, in the words of Rabbi Lawrence Kushner: “Here I am, standing with my dangerous side bridled, ready to pray ” The Bible is full of references to hands, and usually they are about God doing something benevolent and holy with his right hand. I’ll spare you the run-through and stick to a token example, like this one from Psalms 118: “The right hand of the Lord is exalted. The right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly.”</p><p>在西方世界，左撇子长期以来一直与最坏的最坏的东西联系在一起：罪恶、魔鬼崇拜、撒旦本人，以及在上帝面前的全面劣势。天主教学校的老师过去常常告诉学生，左撇子是“野兽的标志”，苏格兰人说，一个运气不好的人一定是被一位左撇子牧师洗礼过，正统派犹太人把左臂缠在皮带上，就像是在说，用拉比劳伦斯·库什纳(Lawrence Kushner)的话说：“我站在这里，站在危险的一边，准备祈祷。”圣经中充满了对双手的提及，通常是关于上帝用右手做了一些仁慈而神圣的事情。我不会赘述，只举一个象征性的例子，就像诗篇118中的这个：“主的右手是高举的。耶和华的右手施展大能。“。</p><p>  While Carl Sagan once hypothesized that the cultural link between left-handedness and badness arose due to the left hand’s use for hygiene purposes in nonindustrialized countries, Wolman points out that the association has much deeper roots, including the very etymology of the word “left”:</p><p>卡尔·萨根(Carl Sagan)曾假设，在非工业化国家，左撇子和坏人之间的文化联系源于左手用于卫生目的，沃尔曼指出，这种联系有着更深层次的根源，包括单词“Left”的词源：</p><p> The Anglo-Saxon  lyft means weak or broken, and even modern dictionaries include such meanings for left as “defective,” “crippled,” “awkward,” “clumsy,” “inept,” and “maladroit,” the latter one borrowed from French, translated literally as “bad right.” Most definitions of  left reduce to an image of doubtful sincerity and clumsiness, and the Latin word for left,  sinister, is a well-known beauty. From this version springs my favorite term for left-handedness, “the bend sinister,” which Vladimir Nabokov used for the title of  a book that has nothing to do with handedness.</p><p>盎格鲁-撒克逊人的Lyft的意思是软弱或破碎，甚至现代词典也包括“有缺陷的”、“残废的”、“笨拙的”、“笨拙的”、“无能的”和“笨拙的”，后者是从法语借来的，直译为“不好的右翼”，意思是“有缺陷的”、“残废的”、“笨拙的”和“笨拙的”。大多数对“左”的定义都简化为一种令人怀疑的真诚和笨拙的形象，而拉丁语中“左”的意思是“邪恶”，这是众所周知的美丽。从这个版本中产生了我最喜欢的左撇子术语“弯曲的险恶”，弗拉基米尔·纳博科夫用它来命名一本与惯用左手无关的书的书名。</p><p> Even today, our understanding of handedness is muddled by misconceptions. While it’s currently estimated that 10-12% of the human population is left-handed, the very definition of handedness is cause for confusion:</p><p>即使在今天，我们对左撇子的理解仍然被误解弄得模糊不清。虽然目前估计有10%-12%的人口是左撇子，但左撇子的定义本身就引起了人们的困惑：</p><p> Most people presume the hand used for writing is the litmus test for determining whether someone is lefty or righty, and for anyone content to live with a pedestrian level of knowledge on the subject, this narrow reading will serve well enough. [And yet] everyday tasks, like throwing and eating, also influence the popular understanding of hand dominance, sometimes nearly as strongly as writing. These different behaviors lead immediately to a quintessential problem of handedness inquiries: how to define handedness itself. The definition of lefty or righty varies, sometimes to a frustrating degree, and that variation has troubled researchers who want to get a better handle on why it is that humans have hand preference and performance discrepancies in the first place, where these discrepancies come from, and why as a population we usually favor the right hand.</p><p>大多数人认为用来写作的手是判断一个人是左撇子还是右撇子的试金石，对于任何满足于在这个主题上平淡无奇的知识水平的人来说，这种狭隘的阅读就足够了。[然而]日常任务，如扔东西和吃饭，也会影响人们对手优势的普遍理解，有时影响程度几乎与写作一样强烈。这些不同的行为立即引出了惯用手问题的一个典型问题：如何定义惯用手本身。左撇子或右撇子的定义各不相同，有时甚至到了令人沮丧的程度，这种变化困扰着研究人员，他们想要更好地理解为什么人类首先会有手的偏好和表现差异，这些差异是从哪里来的，以及为什么作为一个群体，我们通常更喜欢右手。</p><p> Also to be accounted for is the fact that many people are born with a natural inclination to write with the left hand but are schooled out of it for various reasons. (I myself, an adult righty, am among them. The most visceral evidence is found on my left thumb, whose pad an elongated scar splits vertically. It was inflicted while carving a watermelon jack-o-lantern at age six and accidentally flipping the knife the wrong way, pressing onto its edge rather than its blunt side. The fact that I held the knife in my left hand is cited to this day as indication of my natural left-handedness. The fact that I held the knife at all is cited as indication of questionable parenting.)</p><p>同样需要说明的是，许多人生来就有用左手写字的天生倾向，但由于各种原因而后天养成了用左手写字的习惯。(我自己，一个成年右翼，就是其中之一。最发自肺腑的证据是在我的左拇指上发现的，它的垫子上有一条细长的伤疤垂直裂开。这是在六岁的时候雕刻西瓜南瓜灯时造成的，不小心把刀翻错了方向，压在了它的边缘，而不是钝的一边。我左手持刀的事实至今仍被引用为我天生的左撇子。我拿着刀的事实被引用为有问题的育儿方式的迹象。)。</p><p> The most commonly used test for handedness is this imperfect inventory created in the early 1970s, which generates what researchers call a  laterality quotient:</p><p>最常用的惯用手测试是20世纪70年代初创建的这个不完美的清单，它产生了研究人员所说的侧向商数：</p><p>  Still, even if we were able to codify handedness, the question of  why the dichotomy exists in the first place remains open. But before diving into the various theories, Wolman offers an essential primer on how the brain works:</p><p>尽管如此，即使我们能够将惯用手编纂成法典，为什么首先存在二分法的问题仍然悬而未决。但在深入研究各种理论之前，沃尔曼就大脑是如何工作的提供了一个必不可少的入门读物：</p><p> It’s a well-known aspect of the brain-body relationship that control of movement is crisscrossed. That is, the act of swatting at a buzzing mosquito with the right hand is controlled by the left side of the brain, or more specifically by a certain area of the left hemisphere known as the left motor cortex, which sends the necessary signals to muscles in the right arm. The reverse is true for actions carried out with the left hand, and all of this is irrespective of handedness. The hemisphere on the same side as a movement isn’t entirely silent … but for the most part motor control comes from the opposite hemisphere. This contralateral control, first described by Hippocrates himself, isn’t limited to hands. It applies to arms, legs, eyes, ears, and indeed almost all motor faculties, which is why people who’ve had a stroke or tumor on one side of the brain often experience partial or total paralysis on the opposite side of the body.</p><p>众所周知，大脑和身体关系的一个方面是，运动的控制是纵横交错的。也就是说，用右手拍打嗡嗡作响的蚊子的动作是由大脑的左侧控制的，更具体地说，是由左半球的某个区域控制的，称为左侧运动皮质，它向右臂的肌肉发送必要的信号。反之，用左手进行的动作也是如此，所有这些都与惯用左手无关。与运动同侧的半球并不是完全静默的…。但在很大程度上，运动控制来自另一个半球。希波克拉底自己最先描述的这种对侧控制并不局限于手。它适用于手臂、腿、眼睛、耳朵，甚至几乎所有的运动能力，这就是为什么在大脑一侧中风或肿瘤的人经常会经历身体另一侧的部分或完全瘫痪。</p><p>  The left and right sides of the brain are physically quite distinct. The brain is made up of two mostly separate halves, each composed of billions and billions of neural connections. Yet despite popular notions to the contrary, left-handed people do not think in the right hemisphere of the brain, nor do right-handers think in the left hemisphere. The motor cortex, that part of each hemisphere cross-wired to control the other side of the body, is only one relatively minor aspect of this dizzyingly complex organ, and it says nothing or nearly nothing about a person’s thoughts or personality.</p><p>大脑的左右两侧在生理上是截然不同的。大脑由两个基本独立的部分组成，每个部分由数十亿个神经连接组成。然而，尽管流行的观点与之相反，左撇子并不在右脑思考，右撇子也不会在左脑思考。运动皮质是每个半球交叉连接以控制身体另一边的那一部分，在这个令人眼花缭乱的复杂器官中，它只是一个相对较小的方面，它对一个人的想法或个性没有或几乎没有任何说明。</p><p>  So what can the brain reveal about handedness? One of the first scientists to ponder the mystery of left-handedness was pioneering French surgeon Paul Broca, whom Wolman calls “the closest thing the religion of Southpaw has to a prophet.” In 1861, just two years after Darwin had discovered the principles of evolution, Broca encountered two patients who stumped him profoundly. One was an epileptic man named Leborgne but known as “Tan,” nicknamed after the only syllable he was capable of uttering. Leborgne was able to understand spoken language but couldn’t articulate his thoughts in speech — something that perplexed Broca enormously, doubly so given that one of Leborgne’s first symptoms was a weakening of function in the right side of his body, which progressed to more loss of motor control and eventually the loss of sight and some of his mental faculties.</p><p>那么，大脑能揭示出什么关于惯用手的信息呢？首批思考左撇子之谜的科学家之一是法国外科先驱保罗·布罗卡，沃尔曼称他为“左撇子宗教中最接近先知的东西”。1861年，就在达尔文发现进化论原理两年后，布罗卡遇到了两个病人，他们深深地难倒了他。其中一位是一位名叫勒博涅的癫痫患者，但他被称为“谭”，绰号是因为他唯一能说出的一个音节。勒博涅能够理解口语，但不能用语言表达自己的想法-这一点让布罗卡非常困惑，尤其是考虑到勒博涅的首批症状之一是身体右侧的功能减弱，这会导致更多的运动控制能力丧失，最终导致视力和一些智力的丧失。</p><p> When Leborgne died at the age of 51, Broca decided to crack the mystery — literally. He dissected Leborgne’s brain and found a massive lesion in the left frontal cortex, likely due to a tumor. Broca concluded that this must somehow be related to Leborgne’s symptoms, of which the loss of speech was the most dramatic. But a direct link would take longer to recover.</p><p>勒博涅去世时享年51岁，布罗卡决定从字面上揭开这个谜团。他解剖了勒博涅的大脑，发现左侧额叶皮质有一个巨大的损伤，很可能是由于肿瘤造成的。布罗卡得出结论，这一定与勒博涅的症状有关，其中语言丧失是最戏剧性的。但直接联系需要更长的时间才能恢复。</p><p> Then came Lelong, an elderly patient who had ended up in Broca’s care after a fall, only able to utter a few words. When Lelong died two weeks later, Broca discovered a similarly dramatic lesion in the left side of his brain, which is preserved to this day in Paris.</p><p>然后来了乐龙，一位年迈的病人，摔倒后最终由布罗卡照顾，只能说几句话。当勒龙两周后去世时，布罗卡在他的左侧大脑发现了一个类似的戏剧性病变，一直保存到今天在巴黎。</p><p> But the most perplexing of Broca’s patients were the few who had either had damage to the left hemisphere but no difficulties with speech or who had lost their ability to speak but only had damage in the right hemisphere. This led Broca to conclude that for a minority of people, the speech centers were located in the right rather than left hemispheres, which he at first thought might be tied to handedness, but later surmised that both phenomena were anomalous exceptions and weren’t correlated. Still, his work was the first significant spark for the study of handedness and stirred quite the flurry within the scientific community. Wolman points out the clash between science and popular culture that ensued:</p><p>但在布罗卡的病人中，最令人困惑的是少数几个人，他们要么左脑受损，但说话没有困难，要么失去了说话能力，只有右半球受损。这导致布罗卡得出结论，对于少数人来说，语言中心位于右半球而不是左半球，他最初认为这可能与惯用左手有关，但后来猜测这两种现象都是异常例外，没有相关性。尽管如此，他的工作仍然是研究惯用手的第一个重要火花，并在科学界引起了相当大的轰动。沃尔曼指出了随之而来的科学和流行文化之间的冲突：</p><p> Because some people are an exception to the language-to-the-left rule, and because a similarly small proportion of people are left-handed, everyone and his cousin in the medical establishment figured the two must go hand in hand; lefties should have language lateralized to the right. What’s interesting about this conclusion is that few people in nineteenth-century Europe would have admitted to being left-handed. Detecting someone’s left-handedness would have been difficult, with eating, writing, and other major tasks all usually carried out with the right hand. What’s also interesting about this conclusion is that it’s wrong. Nearly 99 percent of right-handers have language located in the left hemisphere, and about 70 percent of lefties do. A different proportion, yes, but hardly the opposite; most lefty brains are like righty brains, at least as far as speech function is concerned. The rest either have language in the right hemisphere, or have it distributed more evenly between the two sides of the brain.</p><p>因为有些人是语言向左规则的例外，而且同样有一小部分人是左撇子，所以医疗机构中的每个人和他的堂兄都认为这两个人必须齐头并进；左撇子应该把语言偏向右侧。这一结论的有趣之处在于，在19世纪的欧洲，很少有人会承认自己是左撇子。检测一个人的左撇子是很困难的，因为吃饭、写作和其他主要任务通常都是用右手完成的。这个结论还有一个有趣之处，那就是它是错误的。近99%的右撇子的语言位于左半球，大约70%的左撇子这样做。一个不同的比例，是的，但很难说是相反的；大多数左脑和右脑一样，至少在语言功能方面是这样。其余的人要么在右半球有语言，要么在大脑的两侧更均匀地分布语言。</p><p>  Though Broca himself had gently dismissed the link between handedness and right-hemispheric speech dominance, he hadn’t gone out of his way to assert the dissociation, so the myth that lefties had their speech located in the right hemisphere persisted for nearly half a century. It wasn’t until WWI, when physicians began to notice that injured veterans who were lefties didn’t necessarily have right-hemispheric language localization, that the myth began to erode and the quest for new theories gained momentum.</p><p>尽管布罗卡自己温和地驳斥了左撇子和右半球语言支配之间的联系，但他并没有特意断言这种分离，所以左撇子的语言位于右半球的神话持续了近半个世纪。直到第一次世界大战，医生们开始注意到左撇子受伤的退伍军人并不一定有右半球语言本地化，这个神话才开始被削弱，对新理论的探索获得了动力。</p><p> Wolman points to several of the notable theories that followed, each in turn disproven by science but offering a valuable piece of the still-unfinished puzzle. One of the earliest proposed that handedness in humans was originally evenly distributed, but hand-to-hand battle in the ancient world killed off the lefties because they held the sword with their left hand and the shield in their right, thus leaving the heart much less protected than for righties, who held the shield on the left. As the lefties perished on the battlefield, so did their genes.</p><p>沃尔曼指出了随后的几个值得注意的理论，每一个理论都被科学证明是错误的，但却提供了这个尚未完成的谜题中有价值的一块。最早的人之一提出，人类的利手最初是均匀分布的，但古代的肉搏战杀死了左撇子，因为他们左手持剑，右手持盾牌，因此心脏受到的保护比左手持盾牌的右手要少得多。随着左撇子在战场上的灭亡，他们的基因也随之消亡。</p><p> The theory was disproven for a number of reasons, including the fact that there is evidence of left-handedness long before the invention of the sword and shield as well as the biological reality that the heredity of handedness isn’t so straightforward.</p><p>这一理论被推翻的原因有很多，包括早在剑和盾牌发明之前就有证据表明左撇子是左撇子的事实，以及左撇子的遗传并不是那么直截了当的生物现实。</p><p> A later theory proposed pretty much the opposite — that left-handedness gave warriors a competitive advantage “for much the same reason left-handed tennis players, boxers, or fencers have an advantage.” Wolman cites the example of a left-handed 16th-century Scottish warrior from the famous Kerr clan:</p><p>后来的一种理论提出了几乎相反的观点--左撇子给战士带来了竞争优势，“这与左撇子网球运动员、拳击手或击剑运动员具有优势的原因大致相同。”沃尔曼引用了16世纪著名科尔氏族的一位左撇子苏格兰战士的例子：</p><p> The lefty advantage exists because, in a world with far fewer lefties than righties, right-handed, or even left-handed, opponents have comparatively little practice facing off against left-handers. Lefty forehands are hit from that less familiar side, their stronger punches originate from that less comfortable side, and their opposing stance differs from what people are accustomed to, namely right-handed opponents. For Andrew Kerr, the matter was of far greater import than for, say, John McEnroe serving up another ace to the ad-court at Wimbledon; for Kerr, success with the sword was a matter of life and death.</p><p>左撇子优势的存在是因为，在一个左撇子比右撇子、右撇子甚至左撇子少得多的世界里，对手相对较少与左撇子对抗。左手正手是从不太熟悉的那一边打出来的，他们更有力的拳头来自不太舒服的那一边，他们的对立姿态与人们习惯的姿势不同，也就是用右手的对手。对安德鲁·科尔(Andrew Kerr)来说，这件事比约翰·麦肯罗(John McEnroe)在温布尔登的广告球场上又发了一张王牌重要得多；对科尔来说，剑的成功关系到生死存亡。</p><p>  French scientists recently hypothesized that fighting advantages for left-handers in prehistoric human societies ensured reproductive success. To test the idea, they looked at the homicide rates in various societies, wondering if the Southpaw advantage might be magnified within historically more violent populations. From the results, it looks like it was, with proportions of left-handedness ranging from 3.4 percent in an especially pacifist African community in Burkina Faso to 22.6 percent in a notoriously violent culture in South America. Southpaws aren’t more violent, of course, but may have had a survival advantage in societies that were.</p><p>法国科学家最近假设，在史前人类社会中，左撇子的战斗优势确保了繁殖的成功。为了测试这一想法，他们观察了不同社会的凶杀率，想知道在历史上更暴力的人口中，左撇子优势是否会被放大。从结果看，看起来是这样的，左撇子的比例从布基纳法索一个特别和平的非洲社区的3.4%到南美臭名昭著的暴力文化的22.6%不等。当然，左撇子并不更加暴力，但在过去的社会中，左撇子可能具有生存优势。</p><p> Still, these hypotheses were never proven with any degree of verifiability. Fast-forward to the late 1970s and early 1980s, when Harvard neurologist Norman Geschwind proposed a theory that endured for many years: He suggested that high levels of testosterone in the womb led to a minor mutation in the brain, which caused its organization to shift away from right-handedness. One support point cited for his theory is the fact that there are slightly more male lefties than female.</p><p>尽管如此，这些假设从未得到任何程度的验证。快进到20世纪70年代末和80年代初，当时哈佛大学神经学家诺曼·格施温德(Norman Geschwind)提出了一个持续多年的理论：他认为，子宫中高水平的睾丸素导致大脑中的一个微小突变，这导致其组织远离右撇子。他的理论被引用的一个支撑点是，男性左撇子比女性略多。</p><p> An earlier womb theory had posited that the fetus’s orientation inside fosters its sense of stability, so handedness is based on whether the fetus uses the left or right hand for balance — the free hand, in most cases the right, can then move and explore, eventually becoming the dominant one.</p><p>早期的子宫理论认为，胎儿在体内的方向会增强它的稳定感，所以惯用手是基于胎儿使用左手还是右手来保持平衡-在大多数情况下，自由的右手可以移动和探索，最终成为主导的一只手。</p><p> Once again, neither theory found sufficient support. And so we return to the brain and genetics. Wolman cites the work of English researcher Marian Annett, who discovered the key to the messy heredity patterns of handedness:</p><p>再一次，这两种理论都没有找到足够的支持。所以我们回到大脑和遗传学上来。沃尔曼引用了英国研究人员玛丽安·安奈特(Marian Annett)的研究，她发现了惯用手混乱的遗传模式的关键：</p><p> In 1972, Annett … published a paper titled, “The Distribution of Manual Asymmetry,” which, although of little notice at the time, would later serve as the foundation for one of the most widely accepted explanations of human handedness. She called it the Right Shift Theory, and she later expanded it in a 1985 volume of the same name. Annett argues that whereas human handedness is comparable to the left- or right-side preferences exhibited by other creatures with hands, paws, feet, or what have you, the approximate 90 percent predominance of right-handedness in the human population sets us apart. All other animals have a 50-50 split between righties and lefties. According to Annett’s model, handedness in nature rests on a continuum, ranging from strong left, through mixed, and then to strong right-handedness. But for humanity the  distribution of preference and performance is dramatically shifted to the right. Human bias to the right, Annett explains, was triggered by a shift to the left hemisphere of the brain for certain cognitive functions, most likely speech. . . . That momentous shift was caused by a gene.</p><p>1972年，Annett…。他发表了一篇题为“手工不对称的分布”的论文，虽然当时鲜为人知，但这篇论文后来成为了对人类惯用手最广泛接受的解释之一的基础。她称其为“右移位理论”，后来她在1985年出版的同名著作中对其进行了扩充。安尼特认为，虽然人类的惯用手与其他有手、爪、脚或其他东西的生物所表现出的左撇子或右撇子的偏好相当，但在人类群体中，大约90%的右撇子占主导地位，这让我们脱颖而出。所有其他动物右手和左手各占一半。根据安奈特的模型，自然界中的惯用手建立在一个连续体上，从强烈的左撇子，到混合的左撇子，再到强烈的右撇子。但对于人类来说，偏好和表现的分布却戏剧性地向右倾斜。安妮特解释说，人类偏向右侧是由大脑的某些认知功能(最有可能是言语)转移到左半球所引发的。。。。这一重大转变是由一种基因引起的。</p><p> Of course, that question had perplexed generations of scientists since Darwin — who, by the way, was a victim of the confounding heredity of handedness: his wife and father-in-law were lefties, but only two of Darwin and Emma’s ten children were. But Annett’s Right Shift Theory was the first systematic explanation for the genetics of handedness. Still, Wolman observes the complexities of genetics:</p><p>当然，这个问题一直困扰着自达尔文以来的几代科学家--顺便说一句，达尔文是左撇子遗传的牺牲品：他的妻子和岳父都是左撇子，但达尔文和艾玛的十个孩子中只有两个是左撇子。但安奈特的右移理论是第一个系统解释惯用手遗传学的理论。尽管如此，沃尔曼观察到了遗传学的复杂性：</p><p> In many ways, the genes-versus-environment dichotomy is a misleading one because so often the two work hand in hand. Say, for instance, a gene or genes instructs for a certain amount of testosterone in the womb. If the level of that hormone varies and somehow influences the development of the fetus, should traits affected by the level of testosterone be dubbed genetic or environmental? One could argue that the biochemical conditions in the womb-the fetus’s surroundings-qualify as environmental factors, but those conditions are shaped by genetic instructions. Yet within the DNA of every cell of that newborn baby, there will be no information specific to the child’s conditions in the womb. Can we call that a genetic trait? Luckily, Annett’s theory supposes a less ambivalent role for a gene, or possibly a few genes. Inside the nuclei of nearly every cell in the body are left-twisting bundles of DNA that either do or do not contain what Annett has dubbed the “Right Shift factor.”</p><p>在许多方面，基因与环境的二分法是一种误导性的二分法，因为这两者往往是齐头并进的。例如，一个或多个基因指示子宫中有一定量的睾丸素。如果这种荷尔蒙水平不同，并以某种方式影响胎儿的发育，那么受睾酮水平影响的特征应该被称为遗传的还是环境的？有人可能会争辩说，子宫内的生化条件-胎儿的环境-是有资格的环境因素，但这些条件是由遗传指令决定的。然而，在新生儿的每个细胞的DNA中，都不会有针对孩子在子宫中的具体情况的信息。我们能称之为遗传特征吗？幸运的是，安奈特的理论假设了一个基因，或者可能是几个基因的角色不那么矛盾。在人体内几乎每一个细胞的细胞核内都有左旋束DNA，它们要么含有或不含有安妮特所说的“右移因子”。</p><p> What this series of hypotheses reveals, more than anything, is just how little we know about the inner workings of the body — despite having sequenced the human genome, here we are still struggling to explain as seemingly simple a characteristic as handedness. And yet, Wolman argues, Annett’s research was groundbreaking and immensely valuable for three reasons: “the idea of a handedness continuum; the chance-based gene predicting not individual handedness but shifted population distribution; and finally the suggestion that people are not left-handed or right-handed, but right-handed or non-right-handed.”</p><p>最重要的是，这一系列假设揭示的是，我们对身体内部的工作原理知之甚少--尽管已经对人类基因组进行了测序，但我们仍然在努力解释像惯用手这样看似简单的特征。然而，沃尔曼认为，安妮特的研究是开创性的，具有巨大的价值，原因有三：“惯用左手的连续体的想法；基于机会的基因预测的不是个人惯用手，而是改变了人口分布；最后，人们不是左撇子或右撇子，而是右撇子或非右撇子。”</p><p>  Perhaps the most interesting theory, however, is a rather fringe proposition that ties handedness to “magical ideation” — one’s tendency to believe in metaphysical phenomena beyond that aren’t scientifically verifiable, from supernatural forces to extrasensory perception to reincarnation and other concepts that wouldn’t hold up to  Carl Sagan’s Baloney Detection Kit. Wolman cites New Zealand scholar Michael Corballis, who has written about the potential link between more brain symmetry — something found in lefties — and magical ideation:</p><p>然而，也许最有趣的理论是一个相当边缘的命题，它将惯用手与“魔术思维”联系在一起-一个人相信超出这一范围的形而上学现象的倾向是无法通过科学验证的，从超自然力量到超感官知觉到转世和其他概念，这些概念都经不起卡尔·萨根(Carl Sagan)的胡言乱语检测工具包。沃尔曼引用了新西兰学者迈克尔·科波利斯(Michael Corbalis)的话，他写过更多的大脑对称性-左撇子身上的一些东西-与神奇的思维之间的潜在联系：</p><p> Hemispheric asymmetry itself may lead to more decisive and controlled action, and perhaps a better ability to organize hierarchical processes, as in language, manufacture, and theory of mind. Those individuals who lack cerebral asymmetry [a.k.a. increased symmetry] may be more susceptible to superstition and magical thinking, but more creative and perhaps more spatially aware.</p><p>大脑半球的不对称本身可能导致更果断和更可控的行动，也许还有更好的组织分层过程的能力，比如在语言、制造和心理理论方面。那些缺乏大脑不对称性的个体[又名。对称性增强]可能更容易受到迷信和魔法思维的影响，但更有创造力，也许更有空间意识。</p><p> On the magical ideation scale — the measure of belief in such phenomena — lefties tend to score higher than righties. And yet, Wolman points out, “anecdotal evidence that lefties are highly represented in low-bullshit-tolerating professions such as journalism and science doesn’t exactly support this notion,” suggesting instead that the magical ideation hypothesis is best “recalibrated as a degree-not-direction descriptor.”</p><p>在魔术思维量表(衡量人们对这类现象的信仰)上，左撇子往往比右撇子得分更高。然而，沃尔曼指出，“坊间证据表明，左撇子在新闻和科学等容忍程度较低的职业中有很高的代表性，这并不完全支持这一观点”，相反，他建议魔术思维假说最好是“重新校准为一个程度而不是方向的描述符”。</p><p> What makes this theory intriguing, however, isn’t its verifiability or lack thereof but what it reveals about our culture’s beliefs about creativity and mental illness, or cognitive abnormality. Wolman writes:</p><p>然而，这一理论之所以耐人寻味，并不是因为它的可验证性或缺乏可验证性，而是因为它揭示了我们文化中关于创造力和精神疾病或认知异常的信仰。沃尔曼写道：</p><p> The magical ideation line of thinking loops back to creativity when we consider findings indicating an increased proportion of left-handers who suffer from such disorders as schizophrenia. With due acknowledgment once again to Corballis for synthesis of this idea, it’s plausible that schizophrenia and magical ideation sprout from similar neurological roots. Research demonstrating connections between mixed-handedness and either of these two conditions advances that plausibility.</p><p>当我们考虑到表明左撇子患精神分裂症等障碍的比例增加的发现时，神奇的思维路线又回到了创造力上。如果再一次承认科巴利斯综合了这一观点，那么精神分裂症和魔术思维有可能发芽于相似的神经学根源。研究表明，混用双手和这两种情况中的任何一种之间的联系都促进了这一似是而非的说法。</p><p>  Consider for a moment that there’s a thin, perhaps blurred line between genius and mental illness. What if some types of genius stem from the same aspect of the brain — or influence on the brain — as, say, magical ideation and schizophrenia, and that </p><p>想一想，天才和精神疾病之间只有一条细微的、也许是模糊的界限。如果某些类型的天才来自于大脑的同一方面--或对大脑的影响--比如，魔术思维和精神分裂症，那该怎么办？</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/03/31/left-handedness-david-wolman/">https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/03/31/left-handedness-david-wolman/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/进化/">#进化</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/mystery/">#mystery</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/左撇子/">#左撇子</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
