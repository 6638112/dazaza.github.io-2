The book and movie  \u201cMoneyball\u201d\u00a0showed how Oakland Athletics\u2019 GM Billy Beane changed the sport by introducing advanced statistical analysis instead of simply relying on reports from human scouts. Today, baseball is ruled by analysts as much as experienced baseball professionals \u2014 but could there be too much data?\n Alex Spier writing in the Boston Globe\u2019s  Sunday Baseball Notes column recently pointed out that Boston Red Sox Manager Alex Cora will have 11 coaches on staff this year for 26 players. Compare that with Terry Francona in 2011, who had six for 25, and you can see the number has nearly doubled.\n Spier attributes this in part to the growing amount of data that teams are collecting, which requires more people to observe, interpret, and implement a plan to leverage. As Spier wrote, \u201cThe result? Several teams now feature three hitting coaches, and staffs keep growing in an effort to distill the mountains of information into a digestible form for the 26 players on a roster.\u201d\n  Baseball is like a laboratory for advanced statistical analysis, and businesses could learn a lot from watching how the sport deals with expanding datasets.\n Companies shovel data into data lakes, tinker with machine learning models, and use this information to make decisions, but they still face fundamental decisions every day that involve their ever-growing mountain of information. Sure, machines and software can help sort it out \u2014 indeed, they are getting better at it \u2014 but anyone who has dealt with poorly targeted advertising or email marketing knows there\u2019s much work to be done.\n  Deepak Jeevankumer, managing director at Dell Technologies Capital, says the difference in play now compared to 2014 is that companies now are focused on getting insights to the people who need it faster. \u201cBig Data has become less relevant than \u2018fast data.\u2019 E-commerce shoppers, streaming media consumers, gamers, stock/crypto traders and enterprise marketeers are demanding fast insights and fast knowledge,\u201d Jeevankumer told me.\n He believes data needs to be analyzed at its source while streaming, and in real-time after a query is created, and that startups that create solutions that allow companies (and baseball teams) to do this will be more successful in the long run.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:19:00", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u53ef\u7528,companies,\u68d2\u7403", "title": "\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\uff0c\u516c\u53f8\u662f\u5426\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u806a\u660e\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\uff1f", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tWith more data available than ever, are companies making smarter decisions?\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/with-more-data-available-than-ever-are-companies-making-smarter-decisions/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u53ef\u7528", "companies", "\u68d2\u7403"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "94c6fef7330750055515144af4e53a28.jpg", "infoid": 1072518, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7a0d\u540e\u7684\u5341\u5e74\u53d1\u5c55\uff0cVR\u8033\u673a\u5df2\u7ecf\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u66f4\u597d - \u4f46\u662f\u5728\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u4e0a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u8bf4\uff0cVR\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u5c06\u662f......\u6e10\u8fdb\u7684\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6211\u4eec\u90fd\u6ce8\u5b9a\u8981\u7ed3\u675f\u8033\u673a\uff08\u4ed6\u4eecVR\uff0cAR\u6216\u4e24\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u7269\uff09\u7ed1\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u8138\u4e0a\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5c11\u4e8e\u4e00\u5927\u4ef6\u4e8b*\u548c\u5343\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u8fd9\u91cc\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u51fb\u8d25\u519b\u5200;\u90a3\u91cc\u7684\u8d85\u81ea\u7136\u3002\u9012\u589e\u66f4\u597d/\u66f4\u8f7b/\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u8033\u673a\u3002\u4e5f\u8bb8\u4eba\u4eec\u4e60\u60ef\u4e8e\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u8033\u673a\u8fdb\u884c\u57f9\u8bad\u3002\u4e5f\u8bb8\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u7a81\u7136\u540c\u610f\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u3002\n\u5b83\u5c06\u652f\u6301FOVEATED\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5947\u7279\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u613f\u666f\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u6765\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\n\u591a\u5e74\u6765\uff0cVR\u8033\u673a\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f04\u6e05\u695a\u4e86\u6574\u4e2a\u6279\u6b21\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u4ecd\u7136\u975e\u5e38\u4ee4\u4eba\u751f\u5fc3\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4ed6\u4eec\u771f\u6b63\u591a\u4e48\u5c0f\u4e86\uff1f", "note_en": "A decade of development later, VR headsets have gotten better and better \u2014 but it\u2019s safe to say, at this point, that VR\u2019s adoption will be \u2026 gradual. If we\u2019re all destined to end up with headsets (be they VR, AR or some mix of the two) strapped to our faces, it\u2019ll be less about one-big-thing* and more the result of a thousand tiny steps. A Beat Saber here; a Supernatural there. Incrementally better/lighter/faster headsets. Maybe folks get used to using headsets for training purposes at work. Maybe everyone suddenly agrees on  what a metaverse is.\n This bit-by-bit advancement held true this year at  CES. There was plenty of VR/AR news, none of it earth shattering \u2014 but each another step in the progression.\n  (* the one potential meteor strike, of course, being if Apple does what it loves to do and swoops in late, drops its version and turns the category on its head. That\u2019s been the rumor \u00a0for a while now.)\n    We\u2019ve known for a while now that Sony has been working on a next-gen headset for the PlayStation 5, following up on the PS VR headset it released in 2016. But beyond a kind of light \u201cWe\u2019re working on it!\u201d announcement back in early 2021 and some details about the controllers a few months later, they hadn\u2019t shared many specifics.\n  They\u2019re still keeping some cards close, but they shared a few more details on what\u2019s now officially known  as the PS VR2. Such as:\n It\u2019ll have a wider field of view than the first-gen headset, at 110 degrees versus 96.\n  It\u2019ll be able to track the motion of your eyes, potentially allowing you to do stuff like highlight interface elements just by looking at them.\n It\u2019ll support foveated rendering, which is a fancy way of saying it can use processing power more efficiently by prioritizing the rendering of whatever\u2019s in the center of your vision.\n They\u2019re building new controllers for it (pictured below) with finger detection and the PS5\u2019s mind-bending adaptive triggers.\n  What\u2019ll the headset look like? Unknown! When will it actually ship? TBD! But with the PS VR being one of the few headsets to even kind of rival the  Oculus Meta Quest in terms of ease of use, it\u2019s nice to see Sony continuing to build here.\n   What\u2019s the best way to handle input in VR? Most of the popular headsets have settled on some sort of controller in each hand. What if you just make your  hand the controller, instead?\n Hand tracking isn\u2019t a brand new idea, of course. Companies  have come and gone with hand tracking as their primary focus.\n But HTC\u2019s approach here is a bit different. Instead of relying entirely on cameras, they\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll strap sensor-packed bands to each wrist to help the system track what the cameras can\u2019t see \u2014 like when one hand is obscuring the other, or you\u2019ve got your arm back behind you for a golf swing. The company also demonstrated the sensors working while attached to other objects, like ping pong paddles and a NERF gun.\n The company says the sensors should start shipping later this year for $129. One catch? For now, at least, it\u2019ll only work with HTC\u2019s Vive Focus 3 headset.\n   VR headsets have gotten a whole lot sleeker over the years, but they\u2019re still pretty beefy. How much smaller can they really get, though?\n Panasonic subsidiary Shiftall has been working on an \u201cultra-lightweight, ultra-high-resolution\u201d headset called the Meganex. With speakers built into the frames and a 1.3\u2033 (2560\u00d72560) display for each eye, they end up looking more like a massive pair of steampunk sunglasses than a headset. While designed to be lightweight and foldable, don\u2019t expect to move around  too much in these ones \u2014 you\u2019ll need to attach them to computer via USB-C to do the heavy graphical lifting.\n    Microsoft already uses Qualcomm chips for their HoloLens headsets, but the companies made things a bit more official this week. At Qualcomm\u2019s keynote it was announced that the two will work together to develop chips built specifically for use in AR headsets, with said chips supporting each of their augmented reality development platforms (Microsoft Mesh and Snapdragon Spaces.)\n   It\u2019s not flashy hardware, but it\u2019s potentially important on the software side of things: Nvidia this week opened up Omniverse, its collection of tools for helping 3D content creators work together in real time.\n  Omniverse is Nvidia\u2019s platform for allowing creators, designers and engineers to collaboratively build virtual worlds. It\u2019s the company\u2019s platform that brings together design tools and assets from first- and third-party applications into a single hardware and software ecosystem. Until now, Omniverse and the various Nvidia tools that support it were in beta, but at CES today, the company took off the beta label and made Omniverse generally available to creators.\n   This one seems mostly like a concept for now, so \u2026 well, don\u2019t fall in love just yet. But TV/phone/air conditioner maker TCL is dabbling in the AR glasses space, pitching something akin to Google Glass in a package that looks much more like a standard pair of specs. \u201cHolographic optical waveguide technology\u201d pushes visuals onto the lens and into your field of view, and their concept video above promises touch-based controls built into the frames.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:18:39", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "ar,vr", "title": "VR\u548cAR\u7ee7\u7eed\u5728CES 2022\u7168", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tVR and AR continue to simmer at CES 2022\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/vr-and-ar-continue-to-simmer-at-ces-2022/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["ar", "vr"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7f5397905636e5537b23df747befac7e.jpg", "infoid": 1072517, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4eca\u5e74\u6211\u4eec\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\uff0c\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u4e09\u661f\u9884\u7b97\u65d7\u8230\u548c\u4ece\u5e76\u884c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6700\u65b0onlyplus\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u9884\u89c8\uff1f\u5f53\u7136\uff0cLG\u548cHTC  - \u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\u5f97\u5230\u5e2e\u52a9 - \u8981\u4e48\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u534e\u4e3a\uff0c\u5728\u5c55\u4f1a\u4e0a\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u51e0\u5e74\u540e\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f88\u5feb\u53c2\u52a0CES\u3002\n\u558a\u51fa\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u914d\u4ef6\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6ca1\u6709\u522b\u7684\uff0canker\u77e5\u9053\u5982\u4f55\u4fdd\u6301\u6210\u672c; $ 220\u5c06\u83b7\u5f97\u89c6\u9891\u680f\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u56fe\u7247\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c2K\u76f8\u673a\uff0c\u4e0e\u5185\u7f6e\u706f\u5854\u548c\u626c\u58f0\u5668\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u5b83\u4e0d\u4f1a\u66ff\u6362\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08\u6216\u8005\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4ef6\u7269\uff0c\u86cb\u767d\u77f3\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u63d2\u5934\u548c\u64ad\u653e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u90a3\u4e9b\u5728\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\uff09\u4fbf\u5b9c\u7684\u4eba\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u89c6\u9891\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "note_en": "This year we got, what, Samsung budget-flagship and a preview of the latest OnePlus device from a parallel event? Certainly things weren\u2019t helped along by the fact that LG and HTC \u2014 which were both involved in the show in some form \u2014 are either mostly or entirely out of the smartphone game. And Huawei, which had a major presence at the show a few years back, won\u2019t be participating in CES any time soon.\n Much of that vacuum has been filled by transportation. Over the past decade, CES has transformed into a major automotive show, as carmakers look to prove to the world that they\u2019re on the bleeding edge of tech, from autonomy to in-car systems to sending robots to the  Martian metaverse. Certainly the show kept  Kirsten and Rebecca very busy this week.\n  CES continues to be a major event on the consumer hardware side of things, as well, even if there aren\u2019t as many phones as there once were. It\u2019s still a major showcase for PCs, connected health, smart home gadgets, accessories and even robotics. It\u2019s also a fascinating look into how the industry is evolving. Take fitness \u2014 the sheer volume of wearables has reduced, though companies are experimenting with newer form factors like rings. Meanwhile, there\u2019s been a surge in companies looking to take on the likes of Peloton and Mirror.\n  At what was a pretty subdued showing for wearables, Garmin managed to grab some headlines with its hybrid Sport smartwatch. Hybrid smartwatches have been an admittedly mixed bag over the years, but Garmin has proven to be a surprisingly strong brand in the wearables category. And the  Vivomove Sport is a pretty great looking watch, with a clean design that will appeal to those put off by flashier smartwatches.\n Trackers had a bit of moment, in the wake of the popularity of products like Tile and Apple AirTags. This year the former got another PC partner, in Lenovo, as the  ThinkPad X1 got Tile tracking support, allowing users to find their lost laptop for up to 14 days, even when powered down. Targus, meanwhile, built Apple\u2019s Find My support directly into  its latest backpack.\n   But Chipolo gets the nod here with the introduction of  CARD. The device, which also supports Find My, is slightly larger than a credit card and designed to live in a wallet, so you get an alert whenever you leave the product behind. I currently own one AirTag, which I use for my keys. As someone who has misplaced his wallet more than once in my adult life, I\u2019d say this is a fairly compelling use case that would make me consider shelling out for another.\n  Devin dropped the AXE11000 Tri-Band Wi-Fi 6E Router at the end of his whole  what my work from home set up would look like if I was independently wealthy roundup (paraphrasing here). This thing is pretty wild \u2014 especially as far as the world of routers go. The system features motorized antenna that adjust to get a stronger signal. No word on price there, but you\u2019re likely going to pay for that luxury on top of TP-Link\u2019s already high base price. But can you really put a price tag on faster Wi-Fi?\n  Shout-out to what\u2019s likely to be a far more reasonably price remote accessory. If nothing else, Anker knows how to keep costs down; $220 will get you  the Video Bar, which is a kind of all-in-one webcam solution. You get a 2K camera with AI-based picture framing, coupled with a built-in lightbar and speakers. It\u2019s not going to replace more advanced studio setups (or, for that matter, the Opal), but it\u2019s a solid plug and play solution for those looking to up their home video game on the (relatively) cheap.\n  Earlier this week, I wrote a lot of words about CES\u2019s evolution as a robotics show. One of the biggest sticking points there is the general lack of viable home robotics, beyond the Roomba and an army of fellow robotic vacuums. I was happy to get a better look at  Labrador\u2019s system this week, however, because it addresses a very real need \u2014 specifically those with limited mobility looking to remain independent. The system is effectively a mobile helping hand for the home.\n  It\u2019s not CES without fun new form factors, and the  Asus Zenbook 17 Fold OLED takes the cake by a mile this year, adopting the foldable phone form factor into a full laptop. What\u2019s most stunning about the thing is that the company actually plans to release the thing. I suspect I\u2019m not alone in assuming this thing was just a concept the first time I saw a render, but Asus is planning to release the system in Q2 of this year. So we\u2019ll see soon enough how close the commercial product looks to these shots.\n  Samsung skipped its usual sensory bombardment this year.

It\u2019s Friday and the snow is falling like the dickens in my neck of the woods. But it was no snow day in the tech world. Not at  all. In fact, one venture firm raised 10 figures of capital today. Can you guess who?\n Before we jump in, today\u2019s TechCrunch staff highlight is  Grace Mendenhall, a member of  the Equity team who is also a documentary film editor. And she\u2019s frankly just the best. Now, the news! \u2014 Alex\n   a16z reloads with $9B in new capital: \u00a0The venture capital money arms race continued this week with news that Andreessen Horowitz has put together $9 billion to invest in venture deals, growth deals and biotech more specifically. As TechCrunch notes, the resulting dollar figure is a boost on the group\u2019s last trio of similar funds. There is, it appears, an infinite capital appetite in today\u2019s startup market.\n Roblox pulls Chinese app: \u00a0Five months after launching with Tencent in China, Roblox\u2019s LuoBuLeSi was taken down. What happened? It may be that Roblox has some work to do on the data side of its service, something that it hinted at in a statement. Regardless, the move is yet another example of how hard it is for non-Chinese companies to build and sell digital products in the country.\n India to investigate Google:\u00a0In the wake of industry complaints from news groups, India\u2019s Competition Commission \u201csaid Friday that Google dominates certain online services and its initial view is that Google has broken the local antitrust laws,\u201d TechCrunch reports. Given how big and lucrative the Indian market is, this is not good news for Mountain View.\n  Before we jump into all the startup news of the day, TechCrunch has a little treat for you. We got veteran venture capitalist Matt Murphy on the phone as 2021 came to a close  to chat about prior tech booms, prior tech busts and what he sees as the strengths and weaknesses of today\u2019s venture game. It\u2019s a great weekend read.\n  Pendulum raises $5.9M for narrative tracking:\u00a0This is a fun one, as the company\u2019s target market is utterly new to me. Per our reporting, Pendulum \u201chelps companies, governments and other organizations track harmful narratives on social media platforms and elsewhere on the web.\u201d I guess you and I currently do this by reading lots of tweets, but seeing a company build software for it makes good sense.\n Peter Reinhardt leaves Twilio: \u00a0Remember when Twilio bought Segment for $3.2 billion? It also bought Segment\u2019s CEO, Peter Reinhardt, as part of the deal. Now, however, the exec is leaving to \u201cbe full-time CEO at Charm Industrial, a carbon mitigation startup he co-founded in 2018,\u201d Ron Miller reports. I can\u2019t quite connect  charm and  carbon, but we\u2019ll keep an eye out for what the startup does next.\n Avataar raises $45M for \u201clife-sized 3D product evaluation\u201d: No, this is not \u201cAvatar,\u201d like the movie. It\u2019s Avataar, a U.S.- and India-based startup that helps consumers \u201cvisualize products in real-life size and feel in their living room\u201d using their phones. Given that we all want to buy more stuff online, but it\u2019s not always easy to picture a new footstool in situ, I like what the company is up to. Unsurprisingly, Avataar is working with e-commerce brands in categories like furniture.\n Bfree wants to update the irksome business of credit collections:\u00a0If you have ever gotten a call from a person who thinks that you owe them or someone that they represent money, you may have harkened back to how much more fun it was to get a root canal. Bfree, a \u201cNigerian credit management fintech,\u201d as TechCrunch puts it, is working to build something that it considers to be more ethical debt collection. The company just raised $1.7 million and is busy recruiting in 16 markets, we report.\n From the CES Beat: TechCrunch\u2019s coverage of the great consumer electronics confab continued today, with posts up on  the promises of elder tech and, well,  all things metaverse, good and bad.\n If you need  even more startup news and notes and analysis this weekend,  the Equity team has you covered.\n After talking to marketing leaders for a year, here\u2019s my advice for CEOs\n  This is a fantastic time to launch a startup, but if you\u2019re trying to grow one \u2014 well, winter is coming.\n We\u2019ve already noted the impacts of new data regulations and consumers\u2019 growing desire for more privacy, but here\u2019s another log to toss on the bad news fire: As a percentage of company revenue, marketing budgets plummeted from 11% in 2020 to 6.4% last year.\n \u201cThis is the lowest proportion allocated to marketing in the history of Gartner\u2019s Annual CMO Spend Survey,\u201d the research company reported.\n Rebecca Lynn, co-founder and general partner at Canvas Ventures, has had dozens of conversations with early-stage founders in recent months.\n In a TechCrunch+ guest post, she covers the \u201cdownward pressure on the efficiency of marketing dollars\u201d and shares several strategies that are producing results \u2014 as well as some \u201ccrazy\u201d ideas \u201cthat seemed ridiculous at the time.\u201d\n (TechCrunch+ is our membership program, which helps founders and startup teams get ahead.  You can sign up here .)\n  Apple keeps working on its fitness product: TechCrunch has news up today regarding Apple\u2019s fitness product, the somewhat lamely named Fitness+. What\u2019s new? Collections, which we write are \u201dcurated series of workouts and meditations\u201d that are targeted at a particular goal. Also new is what\u2019s called \u201cTime to Run,\u201d an \u201caudio running experience,\u201d as we put it.\u00a0Why doesn\u2019t Apple just buy Peloton? I don\u2019t know.\n When does a Twitter Space become a podcast? \u00a0We\u2019re going to find out. Twitter is working on recording its live-audio product, called Spaces. And the social network is saying that it will include replay analytics. Which is super cool? Twitter\u2019s product team is seemingly bringing its really solid 2021 product cadence into the new year.\n And finally, from CES, a   roundup of electric mobility two-wheelers for everyone out there who lives in a city that hasn\u2019t given up its soul to provide more parking for lazy folks.\n   If you have a software consultant that you think other startup founders should know about, fill out the survey  here.\n    Testimonial: \u201cRidhi and team 91Ninjas bring in good domain knowledge, high-quality thinking and focused execution. We chose them for their expertise, disciplined approach and excellent work ethic. Thanks to team 91Ninjas, our inbound marketing engine has picked up good momentum. After coming onboard, they rapidly kick-started work on multiple fronts. In particular, we witnessed good traction on the social media and content front.

Parr looks ahead at what\u2019s coming down the pike, including web3 and NFTs, and gives his advice on how your startup should proceed.\n Should online sellers start planning now to start stocking NFTs? Parr noted that Shopify is testing a pilot program for Shopify Plus customers that helps them sell non-fungible tokens via its platform, but he still suggests a wait-and-see approach:\n \u201cUnless you\u2019re deep in web3-land or have a large enough budget for brand experimentation, you should probably wait until the technology becomes more mature or only dip your toe in the water to start,\u201d writes Parr. \u201cA great NFT launch requires a lot more work than making a JPEG and putting it on the blockchain.\u201d\n  Marketer: Ridhi Singh, founder,  91Ninjas  Recommended by: Anish Khadiya,  itilite  Testimonial: \u201cRidhi and team 91Ninjas bring in good domain knowledge, high-quality thinking, and focused execution.
