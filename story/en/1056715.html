It was an unremarkable breakfast—a fried egg—but it is now digitally fossilized in a floral dish we moved with us when we left New York and headed west. I don’t know why I took the photo, except, well, I do: I had fallen into the reflexive habit of taking photos of everything.</p><p>我还有一张我早上发出的早餐的照片，我结束了八岁的关系并取消了婚礼。这是一个不起眼的早餐 - 煎蛋 - 但是当我们离开纽约和向西走向我们时，我们在与我们一起移动的花盘中经过数字化僵化。我不知道为什么我拍了照片，除了，我这样做：我陷入了拍照的反思习惯。</p><p> Not long ago, the egg popped up as a “memory” in a photo app. The time stamp jolted my actual memory. It was May 2019 when we split up, back when people canceled weddings and called off  relationships because of good old-fashioned dysfunction, not a  global pandemic. Back when you wondered if seating two people next to each other at a wedding might result in awkward conversation, not hospitalization.</p><p> 不久前，鸡蛋在照片应用程序中突然出现了“记忆”。时间戳颠簸了我的实际记忆。这是2019年5月，当我们分手时，当人们取消婚礼并因良好的老式功能障碍而被呼吁关系时，不是全球性大流行。当你想知道在婚礼上坐在彼此相邻的两个人可能会导致尴尬的谈话，而不是住院的时候。</p><p> Did I want to see the photo again? Not really. Nor do I want to see the wedding ads on  Instagram, or a near-daily collage of wedding paraphernalia on  Pinterest, or the “Happy Anniversary!” emails from WeddingWire, which for a long time arrived every month on the day we were to be married. (Never mind that anniversaries are supposed to be annual.) Yet nearly two years later, these things still clutter my feeds. The photo widget on my iPad cycles through pictures of wedding dresses.</p><p> 我想再次看到照片吗？并不真地。我也不希望在Instagram上看到婚礼广告，或在Pinterest上的婚礼用具的近日拼贴画，或者“周年纪念日！”来自Chroofwire的电子邮件，在我们要结婚的那一天抵达每月抵达。 （毫无介意纪念纪念品应该是年度的。）然而，近两年后，这些事情仍然杂乱我的饲料。我的iPad循环上的照片小部件通过婚纱的图片。</p><p>  Of the thousands of memories I have stored on my devices—and in the cloud now—most are cloudless reminders of happier times. But some are painful, and when  algorithms surface these images, my sense of time and place becomes warped. It’s been especially pronounced this year, for obvious and overlapping reasons. In order to move forward in a pandemic, most of us were supposed to go almost nowhere. Time became shapeless. And that turned us into sitting ducks for technology.</p><p>  我已经存储在我的设备上的数千个记忆中 - 在云中 - 大多数是毫无云的提醒更快乐的时代。但有些是痛苦的，当算法表面这些图像时，我的时间和地点都会变成扭曲。这是今年的显而易见和重叠的原因特别明显。为了在大流行前进，我们大多数人都应该走得不无所事去。时间变得无形。而这让我们成为技术的鸭子。</p><p>  Our smartphones pulse with memories now. In normal times, we may strain to remember things for  practical reasons—where we parked the car—or we may stumble into surprise associations between the present and the past, like when a whiff of something reminds me of Sunday family dinners. Now that our memories are digital, though, they are incessant, haphazard, intrusive.</p><p>  我们的智能手机现在脉搏。在正常时期，我们可能会出于实际原因而流动记住事物 - 在我们停放的车间 - 或者我们可能会陷入现在和过去之间的惊喜协会，就像当一个东西让我想起星期天的家庭晚餐时。虽然我们的记忆是数字的，但它们是不间顾，随意的，侵扰性。</p><p>  It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when apps started co-opting memories, madly deploying them to boost engagement and make a buck off nostalgia. The groundwork was laid in the early 2010s, right around the time my now ex and I started dating. For better or worse, I have been a tech super-user since then too. In my job as a technology journalist, I’ve spent the past dozen years tweeting, checking in, joining online groups, experimenting with digital payments, wearing multiple activity trackers, trying every “story” app and applying every gauzy photo filter. Unwittingly, I spent years drafting a technical blueprint for the relationship, one that I couldn’t delete when the construction plans fell apart.</p><p>  当应用程序开始共同回忆时，很难精确定位，疯狂地部署它们以提高接触并使重新偏离令人尴尬。在2010年初奠定了基础，在我现在的前任和我开始约会的时候就奠定了。无论好坏，我也是一个技术超级用户。在我的工作中作为一个技术记者，我花了过去十几年的推文，登记，加入在线组，试验数字付款，佩戴多个活动跟踪器，尝试每个“故事”应用程序并应用每个Gauzy照片过滤器。不知不觉，我花了多年的时间为这段关系起草技术蓝图，在施工计划分崩离析时，我无法删除。</p><p>  If we already are part cyborg, as some technologists believe, there is a cyborg version of me, a digital ghost, that is still getting married. The real me would really like to move on now.</p><p>  如果我们已经是Cyborg，因为一些技术人员认为，我有一个Cyborg版本，这是一个数字幽灵，仍然结婚。真正的我现在真的很想继续前进。 </p><p> The thing it became was not at all what it was at the beginning, which is something that can be said of many relationships (and a lot of tech startups). We were hooked up by mutual friends. At first I thought it wouldn’t work. I was interviewing for a job on a different continent, which I told him on our first date. He was less forthcoming. Weeks after we started dating, he blamed delayed text message responses on a BlackBerry outage I knew had been resolved. I chalked it up to dating in New York.</p><p>它变得变成的东西并不是一开始就是这样的东西，这是可以说的许多关系（以及很多技术初创公司）。我们被共同朋友所吸引。起初我认为它不会工作。我在不同的大陆上采访了一份工作，我在第一次约会时告诉他。他不那么多。我们开始约会后几周，他归咎于我知道的黑莓中断的延迟短信响应。我把它弄得在纽约约会。</p><p>  We were catastrophically different, but connected in ways that seemed important at the time. We were both consumed by technology, for one; he worked in security and I wrote about consumer tech. He gamely went along on my excursions to find a retail shop that would accept a new “wallet” app I was trying out; I was excited for him when he left his institutional tech job for the thorny world of startups. Early on, we compared notes about our middling athletic careers and learned we had both played college basketball for a couple of years. Each of us still had one bad knee. If we combined forces, we joked, we’d have two good knees and four years of eligibility left. We eventually became a unit.</p><p>  我们灾难性地不同，但以似乎重要的方式连接的方式。我们既由技术消耗，为一个;他在安全上工作，我写了关于消费者的技术。他在我的旅行中赌去寻找一个零售商店，可以接受我正在尝试的新的“钱包”应用程序;当他为棘手的初创公司留下他的机构技术工作时，我很兴奋。早期，我们比较了关于我们中间的运动职业的票据，并了解到我们曾经玩过大学篮球几年。我们每个人还有一个坏膝盖。如果我们组合力量，我们开玩笑，我们有两个良好的膝盖和四年的资格。我们最终成为一个单位。</p><p> But I started to feel as though I was often shooting in the dark, and I didn’t quite know or understand why. In 2012 he suggested we move to Silicon Valley. I said I didn’t want to move to Silicon Valley. The following year we packed up and moved to Silicon Valley.</p><p> 但我开始觉得好像我经常在黑暗中射击，我不太了解或理解为什么。 2012年，他建议我们搬到硅谷。我说我不想搬到硅谷。第二年我们包装并搬到硅谷。</p><p> During roughly the same period, in New York City, a pair of entrepreneurs named Jonathan Wegener and Benny Wong were busy working on a Craigslist competitor called Friendslist. The two were also self-described fanboys of the geolocation app Foursquare, which uses your smartphone’s GPS to log your location and share it with friends. The two built a series of add-on features for the app, cheekily dubbed Moresquare, that would send users a text if someone they knew was in their neighborhood, or if two friends they knew were in a nearby bar or restaurant.</p><p> 在纽约市大致相同，在纽约市，一对名为jonathan Wegener和Benny Wong的企业家正在忙于致友好竞争友好的竞争对手。这两者也是对Geolocation App Foursquare的自我描述的粉丝，它使用智能手机的GPS来记录您的位置并与朋友分享。这两者建立了一系列的应用程序，胆量被称为Moresquare，如果他们知道的人在他们的邻居中，如果他们知道的两个朋友在附近的酒吧或餐厅的话，那将向用户发送一个文本。</p><p> So when Foursquare held its first hackathon in February 2011, Wegener and Wong cobbled together software that would notify Foursquare users of their check-ins from one year earlier. Their app garnered them some recognition from Foursquare, which sent over an inflatable, remote-control shark as a prize.</p><p> 因此，当Foursquare于2011年2月举行了第一个Hackathon时，Wegener和Wong将其汇集在一起​​的软件，该软件将从一年前通知四个用户的支票。他们的应用程序从Foursquare获得了一些认可，它通过充气，遥控鲨鱼作为奖品。</p><p> It was a simple thing, but Wegener found these back-when reminders to be “powerful little nuggets.”</p><p> 这是一件简单的事情，但韦格纳发现了这些背心 - 当提醒是“强大的小金块”。</p><p>  “You could almost imagine being there,” he said to me over the phone recently. “You’d remember, like, the name of the restaurant, who you were there with, what you talked about, what you ate.” They abandoned their Craigslist-killer plans and focused on developing the concept further, into an app that would come to be called Timehop.</p><p>  “你几乎可以想象在那里，”他最近对我说。 “你记得，就像那个餐厅的名字一样，你和你在一起的人，你谈过的是什么，你吃了什么。”他们放弃了克雷斯莱斯莱克拉特计划，并专注于进一步发展概念，进入一个将被称为Timehop​​的应用程序。 </p><p> Sign up to get our best longform features, investigations, and thought-provoking essays, in your inbox every Sunday.</p><p>在您的收件箱中注册以获得最佳的长大功能，调查和思想挑衅散文。</p><p> Over the next several years, other popular apps started to include their own features that automatically reminded people of their digital histories.  Facebook being, of course, the most obvious and influential: In 2015 it launched On This Day, after noticing that people were often looking back at old photos and posts. Notifications nudge you to revisit a photo from that day two years ago, or even seven years ago, and reshare it to your News Feed. In 2016, Apple added a Memories tab to its Photos app with the release of iOS 10. Three years later, Google added a feature that showed old photos at the top of the page. It’s called—wait for it—Memories.</p><p> 在接下来的几年里，其他流行的应用程序开始包括自动提醒人们的数字历史的自己的功能。当然，Facebook存在最明显和有影响力：2015年它在这一天推出，在注意到人们经常回顾旧照片和帖子。通知推动您从两年前的那天重新审视照片，甚至七年前，并将其重新分析给您的新闻饲料。 2016年，Apple将一个记忆选项卡添加到其照片应用程序，其中包含iOS 10.三年后，Google添加了一个在页面顶部显示旧照片的功能。它被称为 - 等待IT记忆。</p><p> I faced the infinite unknowing of a person I slept next to, a different kind of loneliness.</p><p> 我面对一个我睡觉的人的无限，不同种类的孤独。</p><p> Yael Marzan, the product team lead for Google Photos, said the search giant was inspired to launch Memories because they realized that the majority of the pictures being stored in Google Photos were never looked at again. Over Google Meet she told me, “Clearly your intent was to store them, to have this content so you could go back and look at them. To be reminded of the good memories.”</p><p> 产品团队为谷歌照片领导的Marel Marzan表示，搜索巨头的启发是推动回忆，因为他们意识到存储在Google照片中的大部分图片再也看不到了。在Google相遇时，她告诉我，“显然你的意图是存储它们，拥有这个内容，所以你可以回去看看它们。被提醒的美好回忆。“</p><p> “It’s been fun watching the habit Timehop created become ubiquitous, starting with Facebook’s copycat,” Wegener says. “And now it’s just assumed that every product has that as a feature.” When Wegener and Wong left Timehop, in 2016 and 2017, respectively, Wegener joined Snapchat, while Wong became an engineer at Instagram. Both apps now have memory features.</p><p> “看着习惯时间乐于泛滥的习惯时间，从Facebook的CopyCat开始时，这一直很有趣，”Wegener说。 “现在它刚刚假设每个产品都有一个功能。”当Wegener和Wong左转时间阶段，在2016年和2017年，Wegener分别加入Snapchat，而Wong成为Instagram的工程师。两个应用程序现在都有内存功能。</p><p> To hear technologists describe it, digital memories are all about surfacing those archival smiles. But they’re also designed to increase engagement, the holy grail for ad-based business models.</p><p> 为了听到技术学家描述它，数字存储器都是关于浮出水面的笑容。但他们还旨在增加参与，为广告的业务模式提供圣杯。</p><p>  Take Timehop, which has morphed into a memory monetization machine. It still shows you your old check-ins and photos, but the backbone of its business is a proprietary mobile ad server called Nimbus, which powers a real-time auction between different ad networks—“all in the blink of an eye,” Wegener says—as you wait for your next dose of digital nostalgia. With Timehop, as with Facebook and others, it’s the memories that keep you in the apps that are showing you the ads.</p><p>  迈出时间钟，它变形到内存货币化机器中。它仍然向您展示您的旧签到和照片，但其业务的骨干是一个名为Nimbus的专有移动广告服务器，它可以在不同的广告网络之间实时拍卖 - “眨眼间，”Wegener说 - 当你等待你的下一个数字怀旧剂量时。随着时间钟，与Facebook和其他人一样，它是让您在向您显示广告的应用程序中的回忆。 </p><p> This monetization of emotional memory isn’t just off-putting in theory; it can also inhibit personal growth, as I was slowly learning. “Forgetting used to be the default, and that also meant you could edit your memories,” says Kate Eichhorn, who researches culture and media at the New School in New York City and wrote the book   The End of Forgetting. “Editing memories” in this context refers to a psychological process, not a Photoshop tool. The human brain is constantly editing memories to incorporate new information and, in some cases,  to cope with trauma.</p><p>这种情绪记忆的货币化不仅仅是在理论上脱离;它还可以抑制个人成长，因为我慢慢学习。 “忘记曾经是默认值，这也意味着你可以编辑你的记忆，”纽约市新学校的文化和媒体研究文化和媒体，写了这本书的遗忘了。在这种情况下，“编辑存储器”是指心理过程，而不是Photoshop工具。人类大脑不断编辑记忆，以纳入新信息，在某些情况下应对创伤。</p><p> Eichhorn’s book centers on children and adolescents who are growing up with  social media, the so-called digital natives who don’t have the benefit of spending the first half of their lives off the internet, as I did. Eichhorn argues that the people most deeply affected by digital memories are those who stand to gain the most by being allowed to reinvent themselves. “If you think about this in relation to LGBTQ youth, they may have a real desire to distance themselves from the past,” she says.</p><p> Eichhorn的儿童和青少年的书籍中心正在与社交媒体成长，所谓的数字本地人，当我所做的那样，没有人在互联网上消费的上半年的利益。 Eichhorn认为，最深受数字记忆的影响是通过被允许重塑自己的人来获得最大的人。 “如果您认为这是关于LGBTQ青年的考虑，他们可能有一个真正的愿望与过去距离，”她说。</p><p>  But some of the same ideas apply to adults, she adds. Life is marked by change, a series of graduations from one phase to the next, even if it doesn’t involve a cap and gown or an official ceremony. And, Eichhorn notes, there’s been surprisingly little written about the specific impact of our digital culture on memory.</p><p>  但她补充说，一些同样的想法适用于成年人。生活是由变化的标志，一系列阶段从一个阶段到下一个阶段，即使它不涉及帽子和礼服或官方仪式。而且，Eichhorn笔记，对我们数字文化对记忆的具体影响令人惊讶的是。</p><p> “The postwar generation might have had a few photographs, but not an excess of documentation. This meant you could edit your memories, which I personally think is a good thing.” Now, Eichhorn says, our lives play on a constant digital loop. If it’s not the end of forgetting, it’s at least the diminishment of it.</p><p> “战后一代可能有几张照片，但没有超过文件。这意味着你可以编辑你的回忆，我个人认为是一件好事。“现在，Eichhorn说，我们的生活在恒定的数字循环上发挥作用。如果不是遗忘的结束，那就至少减少了它。</p><p> For years I kept an Excel spreadsheet of every app I downloaded, every service I signed up for, so I could later go through the list and try to delete accounts. This offered only the illusion of control. In reality, my digital id was unleashed. I was app-promiscuous. Even if I deleted apps on my phone, watched them wobble and then disappear into the ether, the data never really went away.</p><p> 多年来，我保留了我下载的每个应用程序的Excel电子表格，我注册的每个服务，所以我稍后可以通过列表并尝试删除帐户。这仅提供了控制的幻觉。实际上，我的数字身份证是释放的。我是App-Promisuous。即使我在手机上删除了应用程序，看着他们摆动，然后消失在以太中，数据从未真正消失过。</p><p>  My partner thought I was too online, partly because his job in security made him skittish, partly because my phone took up so much of my attention. I saw the phone habit as an occupational hazard—I had to follow the news!—with a fair amount of personal upside. I had digital imprints of birthdays, trips, and holiday parties. I had a check-in from the hole-in-the-wall restaurant we couldn’t remember the name of. When family members passed away, I had videoclips for posterity and photos I could print out. Without realizing it, I had slipped into the role of memory keeper.</p><p>  我的合作伙伴以为我太过在网上，部分是因为他的安全工作让他闻到了他的恐惧，部分是因为我的手机占据了我的注意。我看到手机习惯作为职业危害 - 我不得不跟随新闻！ - 适当数量的个人上行。我的生日，旅行和假日派对的数字印记。我从墙上的墙上的餐厅办理登机手续，我们不记得该名称。当家庭成员通过时，我有海上和照片的录像线，我可以打印出来。没有意识到它，我已经陷入了记忆守门员的作用。</p><p> I believed there must be some currency to all this. But I don’t really know how to value it, except to note that today more than 16,000 images and 1,000 videos are stored in my Apple and Google photo apps. The very first photo is from the day my ex and I built terribly ugly snowmen in Central Park. (The most recent one is a video I sent to a friend in the ICU, hoping the clip would make him laugh. It did.)</p><p> 我相信所有这一切都必须有一些货币。但我真的不知道如何重视它，除了请注意，今天超过16,000张图片和1000个视频存储在我的Apple和Google照片应用程序中。第一张照片是从我的前任的那天，我在中央公园建造了非常丑陋的雪人。 （最近的一个是我发送给ICU的朋友的视频，希望剪辑会让他笑。它做到了。） </p><p> Personal technology may have advanced in leaps and bounds throughout the 2010s, but my relationship ended up being defined by stasis. Would we or wouldn’t we move forward? Were we really happy? We loved each other—wasn’t that enough? He traveled a lot for work, and then I did too. When we were both in the apartment, the air was thick with arguments and inertia, not because we were cocooning but because we didn’t know where we were supposed to go next. During our first years in California, I missed my life back home, because it was home. New York was so fast and vast, I had grown to accept that parts of it were simply unknowable. Now I faced the infinite unknowing of a person I slept next to, a different kind of loneliness.</p><p>在2010年代，个人技术可能已经进入突飞猛进和界限，但我的关系最终被屏蔽所定义。我们会或我们不会向前迈进吗？我们真的很开心吗？我们彼此相爱 - 不是那么糟糕吗？他走了很多工作，然后我也是。当我们俩都在公寓时，空气与争论和惯性厚，不是因为我们是茧，但是因为我们不知道我们应该在哪里下一步。在我们在加利福尼亚州的第一个岁月中，我错过了我的生命回家，因为它是家。纽约是如此迅速和巨大，我已经成长为接受它的部分是简单的不可知的。现在我面临着一个我睡觉的人的无限不知道，不同种类的孤独。</p><p>  Our disjointedness was obvious. During a vacation in the summer of 2016, a venture capitalist from Silicon Valley struck up a conversation with us while we watched the NBA finals at a tiki bar. He assumed we were married, and when he learned we were not, he looked at me and said, “You do know what a sunk cost is, right?” Of course I did. I probably even laughed. Later on he emailed me, but I never followed up.</p><p>  我们的失抚是显而易见的。在2016年夏天的假期，硅谷的风险投资家在观看了Tiki酒吧的NBA决赛时与我们进行了谈话。他假设我们结婚了，当他了解到我们不是，他看着我说，“你知道沉没的成本是什么，对吗？”我当然做了。我甚至笑了。后来他通过电子邮件发送给我，但我从未跟进过。</p><p> Two and a half years later, in early 2019, my partner and I decided to get married—surprising ourselves, maybe, as much as anyone else. He paused for an abnormally long time during a hike, long enough for me to whip out my iPhone and take a photo of him under a wind-bent cypress, just before he proposed. When we got back to our apartment, I realized the exercise-tracking app Strava had recorded it all, even the drive home. I had been too distracted to press Finish. We didn’t start calling people to share the news until the following morning, when I was on my way to the airport for another reporting trip. When I got back, we started planning a wedding.</p><p> 两年半后，2019年初，我的伴侣和我决定结婚 - 也许，也许和其他人一样多。他在徒步旅行期间暂停了一个异常长的时间，足以让我鞭打我的iPhone，并在他提出之前在风弯曲的赛普拉斯下拍摄他的照片。当我们回到我们的公寓时，我意识到了运动跟踪应用程序Strava录制了这一切，即使是驱动器家。我太分心了，以新闻完成。在第二天早上，我们并没有开始致电人们分享新闻，当时我正在前往机场的另一个报告之旅。当我回来的时候，我们开始计划婚礼。</p><p>  True to form, I signed up for more than a dozen wedding-related apps. I followed florists and dressmakers, subscribed to vendor mailing lists, and registered at home-goods stores. I snapped photos of every venue we toured, every dish we tasted, any spot we might want to consider if we just eloped. I even reactivated my Pinterest account, after telling a friend I didn’t know what to do with my hair (per usual) and she suggested a Pinterest collage of unattainable updos.</p><p>  符合表格，我注册了十几个与结婚相关的应用程序。我跟着花店和裁缝，订阅供应商邮件列表，并在家庭商店注册。我拍摄了每一个场地的照片，我们尝到了每一盏菜，如果我们刚刚被私奔，我们可能想要考虑的任何地方。我甚至重新激活了我的Pinterest帐户，在告诉朋友后，我不知道用我的头发（每平时）怎么做，并且她建议了一个无法实现的updos的Pinterest拼贴画。</p><p> This flurry of activity, the mad rush—we were to get married by the end of 2019—was unfamiliar territory. Friends said it was normal to feel stressed before a wedding. This was different. Every moment felt loaded, every small decision a microcosm of our bigger decision-making woes. I wasn’t even sure I wanted a wedding. We chose a wedding venue that supported a nonprofit, which was largely my choice; if the marriage went south, I wanted something good to come from it. Deep down I knew things weren’t right. One night, as we got ready for bed, I said out loud into the room and to no one in particular, “This sucks,” and I knew that much was true.</p><p> 这一活动的狂热，疯狂的匆忙 - 我们将在2019年底结婚 - 是陌生的领土。朋友说，在婚礼前感到压力是正常的。这是不同的。每一刻感觉到，每一个小决策都是我们更大的决策困境的微观。我甚至不确定我想要婚礼。我们选择了一个支持一个非营利组织的婚礼场所，这在很大程度上是我的选择;如果婚姻南方，我希望有些东西来自它。深度深，我知道事情不对。一天晚上，当我们准备睡觉时，我大声说出了房间，特别是没有人说：“这很糟糕，”我知道这太多了。</p><p>  Two days later, the morning I took the egg photo, I called it off. I drove to the Apple Store to buy a new power adapter for my laptop, so I would no longer have to borrow his. The customer service rep noticed I was sweating and asked if I had just gone running. Yes, I said, and where was the lie?</p><p>  两天后，早上我拿了鸡蛋照片，我打电话给它。我开车到Apple商店为我的笔记本电脑买了一个新的电源适配器，所以我不再需要借他的。客户服务代理注意到我出汗，问我是否刚刚跑步。是的，我说，谎言在哪里？</p><p> The wedding itself was canceled in a series of fast phone calls, emails, and forfeited deposits. The save-the-date cards were shoved into a closet. The other remnants of an eight-year relationship would be a lot harder to erase.</p><p> 婚礼本身被取消在一系列快速电话，电子邮件和没收存款中。将节省日期卡送入壁橱。八岁的关系的其他残余会越来越难以擦除。 </p><p> Social media and photo apps were by now full-on services, infused with artificial intelligence, facial recognition, and an overwhelming amount of presumption. For months, photos of my ex appeared on the Google Home Hub next to my bed, the widgets on my iPad, and the tiny screen of my Apple Watch. So yeah: My ex’s face sometimes shows up on my wrist. As I write this, Facebook reminds me that nine years ago I visited him in Massachusetts and met his family’s dog.</p><p>社交媒体和照片应用程序现在是全面的服务，融入了人工智能，面部识别和压倒性的推定量。几个月，我的前任照片出现在我的床旁边的谷歌家居中心，我的iPad上的小部件以及我的Apple手表的微小屏幕。所以是的：我的前脸有时会在手腕上出现。正如我写这一点，Facebook让我想起了九年前，我在马萨诸塞州拜访了他并遇见了他的家人的狗。</p><p> But as frustrating as it was when old photos bubbled back up to the surface, I felt at least some agency in knowing I had been an active participant in their creation. Trying to wade through and manage wedding-specific accounts, ones I no longer had use for, felt like deep-diving into the dysphotic zone.</p><p> 但是，当旧照片击中表面时，我认为至少有一些机构知道我是他们创造的积极参与者。试图通过并管理婚礼特定的账户，我不再使用的账户，感觉像深潜进入缺点。</p><p> I had opted to use WeddingWire instead of the Knot after reading reviews of the most popular websites for managing wedding vendors. I hadn’t realized that WeddingWire and the Knot had merged under the same private equity firm, along with the Bash and the Bump. Now I wanted it all to vanish. A customer service rep for WeddingWire told me that accounts can be deactivated but never permanently deleted. This is “in case the user ever wants to come back to WeddingWire for whatever reason.” (I’ll be eloping next time, thanks very much.)</p><p> 在阅读对管理婚礼供应商最受欢迎的网站的审核后，我选择使用培训武器而不是结。我没有意识到婚礼武器和结在同一个私募股权公司下合并，以及抨击和凹凸。现在我希望这一切都消失了。 Cedighwire的客户服务代表告诉我，帐户可以被停用，但从未永久删除。这是“如果用户想要以任何原因返回婚礼的情况下。” （下次我会闪过，非常感谢。）</p><p> “We call this the miscarriage problem,” Seyal said, almost as soon as I sat down and cracked open my laptop.</p><p> “我们称之为流产问题，”Seyal说，几乎我坐下来坐下来打开我的笔记本电脑。</p><p> Even if I could permanently delete my WeddingWire account, I had already shared uncountable bits of data with marketers during the time I used the website. “It’s one thing to say ‘I want to buy shoes’ and then have that ad follow you across the internet,” says Jeremy Tillman. “But there are specific life events that are these exclamation points for marketers. Like, I’m going to get married! Or, I’m going to have a kid! And the more valuable that data is, the more intrusive it seems.”</p><p> 即使我可以永久删除我的培训武力账户，我也已经在我使用该网站时与营销人员分享了不可数的数据。 “说'我想买鞋子是一件事，然后在互联网上跟着你，”Jeremy Tillman说。 “但是有具体的生活事件是营销人员的这些感叹号。喜欢，我要结婚了！或者，我要有一个孩子！数据似乎更有价值，似乎更加侵入。“</p><p>  Tillman is the president of  Ghostery, which offers an open source browser extension that shows you how many trackers are receiving data from the websites you visit—a mere glimpse at the network of data brokers that are creating shadow profiles of you. While I was on the phone with Tillman, I punched WeddingWire.com into a Chrome browser, navigated to a page for a wedding DJ, then clicked on the Ghostery extension. At least 16 trackers were identified—including Google Ads, DoubleClick, and Facebook Custom Audience. I had browsed web pages like this dozens of times in 2019. And then, suddenly, I had stopped.</p><p>  Tillman是Ghostery的总裁，它提供了一个开源浏览器扩展，向您展示了从您访问的网站上接收数据的追踪仪器，仅仅是在创建您的暗影配置文件的数据经纪网络网络中的瞥见。虽然我在手机上用蒂曼打电话，但是将Heddingwire.com打入了Chrome浏览器，导航到婚礼DJ的页面，然后点击Ghostery Extension。确定了至少16个跟踪器 - 包括Google广告，DoubleClick和Facebook自定义受众。我在2019年浏览了像这样的网页这样的网页。然后，突然，我已经停了下来。</p><p> “In your case, you have the life cycle of somebody that you’re not, following you throughout the web and beyond,” Tillman says. “It’s like a ghost life cycle that you never had the chance to live out.”</p><p> “在你的情况下，你有一个人的生命周期，你没有，在整个网络和超越中关注你，”蒂曼说。 “这就像一个鬼的生命周期，你从来没有机会过出去。” </p><p> In one instance I learned that my personal data had been accessed—and was possibly being used—in more nefarious ways. The company Minted sent repeated warnings that our wedding website would expire in 2020. I was too tired to go through the motions of taking it down, so I let the subscription run its natural course. A month after letting the wedding website expire, I received notice of a data breach: My login, password, phone number, and address had been obtained and were floating around the internet. Cool.</p><p>在一个例子中，我了解到我的个人数据已经访问 - 并且可能正在使用更加令人邪恶的方式。该公司铸造了一再警告，我们的婚礼网站将在2020年到期。我太累了，无法通过将它取下的动作，所以我让订阅运行其自然课程。在让婚礼网站到期后一个月，我收到了数据违规通知：我的登录名，密码，电话号码和地址已经获得并围绕互联网浮动。凉爽的。</p><p>  I had been using Pinterest on both the web and my iPhone, sometimes ending up in the app unplanned because a Google search for wedding #inspo would lead me there. Several months after putting all wedding-related activities behind me, I was still getting daily suggestions for “pins” in my email inbox. These were feverish vision boards of hetero-normative matrimony, sultry brides in egg-white gowns and elaborate jewels posing in cavernous spaces. Or couples standing in fields, exchanging their vows. All of them clear-day weddings (on Pinterest it never rained). Would the app ever catch up to real life?</p><p>  我一直在Web和iPhone上使用pinterest，有时在计划内联盟，因为谷歌搜索婚礼#inspo会引导我。在我身后的所有婚礼相关活动延时几个月后，我仍然在我的电子邮件收件箱中获得“PIN”的日常建议。这些是异常规范婚姻的狂热视觉板，鸡蛋白袍的闷热新娘，并详细阐述了在海绵体空间上摆姿势的珠宝。或者夫妻站在田野里，交换他们的誓言。所有这些都有清单的婚礼（从未下雨的Pinterest）。该应用程序是否会赶上现实生活？</p><p> It occurred to me that Pinterest’s San Francisco office was around the corner from my own. So on a blindingly sunny day in October 2019, I met with Omar Seyal, who runs Pinterest’s core product. I said, in a polite way, that Pinterest had become the bane of my online existence.</p><p> 我想到了Pinterest的旧金山办事处是从我自己的拐角处。因此，在2019年10月的一个蒙上阳光灿烂的日子里，我遇到了奥马尔Seyal，他们运行Pinterest的核心产品。我以礼貌的方式说，那个Pinterest已成为我在线存在的祸根。</p><p> “We call this the miscarriage problem,” Seyal said, almost as soon as I sat down and cracked open my laptop. I may have flinched. Seyal’s role at Pinterest doesn’t encompass ads, but he attempted to explain why the internet kept showing me wedding content. “I view this as a version of the bias-of-the-majority problem. Most people who start wedding planning are buying expensive things, so there are a lot of expensive ad bids coming in for them. And most people who start wedding planning finish it,” he said. Similarly, most Pinterest users who use the app to search for nursery decor end up using the nursery. When you have a negative experience, you’re part of the minority, Seyal said.</p><p> “我们称之为流产问题，”Seyal说，几乎我坐下来坐下来打开我的笔记本电脑。我可能已经畏缩了。 Seyal在Pinterest的角色不包括广告，但他试图解释为什么互联网让我展示婚礼内容。 “我将此视为偏见问题的版本。大多数开始婚礼规划的人都在购买昂贵的东西，所以他们有很多昂贵的广告投标。而且大多数开始婚礼规划的人完成了它，“他说。同样，使用该应用程序的最常用的用户来搜索托儿所的装饰最终使用托儿所。当你有一个负面的经验时，塞耶尔说，你是少数民族的一部分。</p><p> The internet doesn’t know or care whether you actually had a miscarriage, got married, moved out, or bought the sneakers. It takes those sneakers and runs with whatever signals you’ve given it, and good luck catching up.</p><p> 互联网不知道或关心你是否实际上有流产，结婚，移出，或买了运动鞋。它需要那些运动鞋，并用你给它的任何信号运行，祝你好运。</p><p> When engineers build  ad retargeting platforms, they build something that will continually funnel more content for the things you’ve indicated you’re interested in. On average, that’s the correct thing to do, Seyal said. But these systems don’t factor in when life has been inter</p><p> 当工程师构建广告零售平台时，他们建立了一些将不断漏斗的东西，以便为您所指出的事情进行更多内容。平均而言，Seyal说，这是正确的事情。但这些系统不会因素而不是inter</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/story/weddings-social-media-apps-photos-memories-miscarriage-problem">https://www.wired.com/story/weddings-social-media-apps-photos-memories-miscarriage-problem</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/照片/">#照片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/memories/">#memories</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
