affiliate commissions from the links on this page.  Terms of use.\n       According to Microsoft, Windows 11 will take a substantial step backward relative to Windows 10. Specifically, Windows 11 Home will now  require both internet access and a Microsoft account in order to set up the PC.\n  Speaking as a reviewer, this requirement is ludicrous. I build and wipe testbeds on a regular basis. I am not interested in creating a burner account to handle this task and I do not always need to connect a testbed to the internet. If I am attempting to benchmark the behavior of two specific versions of Windows, an OS that forces me to update to the latest version as a condition of installation literally prevents me from doing my job.\n I recognize, however, that I\u2019m a niche case. While I find these strictures annoying, they aren\u2019t problems for your average PC user. And they aren\u2019t the reason I will never log into a Microsoft account in order to use my own PC.\n  I\u2019m willing to cop to the fact that this may be an artifact of the time in which I grew up. To me, my PC and \u201cthe internet\u201d are two entirely different things. I connect to the latter to download files, read news, and watch content, but it is not the totality of my personal computer. Using an online account to log into my personal PC breaches the distinction between the two. Weird as it is \u2014 because I\u2019m willing to admit this is a personal oddity \u2014 I find that distinction matters to me. It actually matters a lot. I don\u2019t  want my local Windows account to be synonymous with an online login.\n   The other reason I won\u2019t use an online account is that Microsoft won\u2019t stop trying to force me to use one.\n I\u2019m not accusing Microsoft of having spied on users or abused its data-gathering capabilities. While there were some telemetry concerns with Windows 10 initially, the company addressed them in later updates. There have been no privacy or security scandals caused by the use of a Microsoft account instead of a local account. As far as I\u2019m aware, using a Microsoft account instead of a local account does not risk your personal privacy or security.\n  My problem with Microsoft and non-local accounts is this: Since the introduction of Windows 10, Microsoft has pulled every dirty trick in the book. It has obfuscated the ability to create a local account by hiding it in unclear language. It has deployed installers that hid the option to create a local account unless you were offline when you ran setup. It has deployed \u201cGet Windows 10\u201d tools that were so aggressive, they acted more like malware than a product built by a Fortune 500 company.\n  I will not  be browbeaten into adopting an online account as a local login because Microsoft found it convenient to gaslight its own users into submission. Had Microsoft offered the option as a feature with Windows 10 and left the issue alone thereafter, I might have switched eventually. But it didn\u2019t. It\u2019s  important to Microsoft that you use an online account.\n   I don\u2019t know why Microsoft wants everyone to use an online login. I don\u2019t know why Microsoft felt it had the right to treat its customers the way it did with the Get Windows 10 campaign or its six-year battle to push everyone to use online accounts. But I will not play this game. I will not hedge and say \u201cWell, you can actually create a local account after you sign in for the first time and switch to that.\u201d Defaults have tremendous power  and Microsoft knows it.\n The option to create a Windows login via an online account is great. The requirement to do so is an unacceptable intrusion into what\u2019s supposed to be the user\u2019s  personal computer. I am uninterested in joining the Greater Microsoft Data Conglomerate in any capacity beyond the level I\u2019m already forced to participate in and I\u2019m will not reward what I view as borderline abusive behavior with compliance. Companies that intend to treat your data ethically do not grasp for it like a slobbering ambulance chaser.\n According to  Satya Nadella, \u201cWindows has always stood for sovereignty for creators and agency for consumers.\u201d Maybe it did once. Today, \u201cagency for consumers\u201d appears to mean \u201cagency for consumers, so long as they make  Microsoft-approved choices, use  Microsoft services and products, do not wish to delay updates, and  do not mind their PCs rebooting out from under them without warning.\u201d\n  That\u2019s not the kind of agency I had in mind when I sat down to learn MS-DOS 3.1 some thirty years ago. It\u2019s not the kind of agency I had in mind when I bought my first PC running Windows 98 SE. It\u2019s not the kind of agency I\u2019m willing to accept today.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:38:44", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "microsoft,account", "title": "\u6211\u6c38\u8fdc\u4e0d\u4f1a\u4f7f\u7528Microsoft\u5e10\u6237\u767b\u5f55\u6211\u81ea\u5df1\u7684PC ", "title_en": "I Will Never Use a Microsoft Account to Log Into My Own PC", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.extremetech.com/computing/324134-i-will-never-use-a-microsoft-account-to-log-into-my-own-pc", "via": "", "real_tags": ["microsoft", "account"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "47bf7ea35766a27ba3dfdba37b3707f3.jpg", "infoid": 1068460, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u672c\u5468\u9898\u4e3a\u201c\u8499\u4f50\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u7684\u6b7b\u4ea1\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u94f6\u884c\u6218\u4e89\uff1a\u6c64\u59c6\u00b7\u5e03\u6d1b\u59c6\u83f2\u5c14\u5fb7\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\uff1a0\uff1a00 intro02\uff1a52\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4f01\u4e1a\u5bb6\u7cbe\u795e\uff1f06\uff1a04 ...

This is the native home of hope. When it fully learns that cooperation, not rugged individualism, is the quality that most characterizes and preserves it, then it will have achieved itself and outlived its origins. Then it has a chance to create a society to match its scenery. \u2014 Wallace Stegner,  The Sound of Mountain Water   1\n Here is the essential point: California has never had enough water. The current drought is simply the latest evidence that this is a dry land, not \u201csusceptible of supporting a very large population,\u201d\u00a0as an American military officer wrote in the 1840s.   2 But of course the region has shown itself more than susceptible of supporting \u2014 or at least attracting \u2014 a very large population. Modern California, with almost forty million people, and the largest economy in the United States, has seemed again and again to overcome the limits of its natural environment.\n Modern California is in fact an extraordinary achievement. To make a semi-arid region not only habitable but also prosperous and abundant has required  massive and sustained geo-engineering \u2014 the construction, over generations, of a complex network of reservoirs and dams, of aqueducts, tunnels, and canals, of pumping stations and treatment plants, much of which is dedicated not only to harvesting, storing, and supplying water but also to transporting it from where it originates, in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, to where it is needed, in the great coastal cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles and the farmlands of the Central Valley.\n The history of this achievement has been amply documented, from the mid 19th-century settlement of the Central Valley and its development into  one of the most highly managed agricultural landscapes on the planet, what historian Kevin Starr has called \u201cthe most productive unnatural landscape in the world\u201d   3; to the diversion of Owens Lake, in the eastern Sierras, a century ago, to provide water for the growing metropolis of Los Angeles; to the flooding of the Hetch Hetchy Valley, in Yosemite, to create the reservoir that for decades has served San Francisco, more than 150 miles to the west.   4\n But the very success of this achievement has produced a  wicked tangle of problems which are not only ecological and environmental but also political, economic, and legal. Hetch-Hetchy Dam was controversial from the start (early opponents included the Sierra Club and its founder John Muir) and remains so today, with activists clamoring for the restoration of the valley. Owens Lake enabled the rise of L.A. but was eventually pumped dry and became,\u00a0 as Karen Piper put it in an article in this journal,\u00a0\u201ca howling wasteland of toxic dust.\u201d And the transformation of the 450-mile-long, 50-mile-wide Central Valley from a region of shallow lakes and vast marshes into a gridded geometry of irrigated farmlands has required the pumping of enormous amounts of groundwater, which has led to  soil subsidence and heaved roads and fractured canals. More ominously, it has led to depletion of the Valley aquifer; because groundwater pumping is unregulated, it\u2019s unclear how much fresh water now remains, but already farmers are digging  deeper and deeper wells\u00a0and depending upon increasingly saline water to irrigate their orchards and fields. And along the way, the state\u2019s increasingly sophisticated capacity to move and manage water has been accompanied by an increasingly complex and irreconcilable series of legal agreements, from unquantifiable principles like \u201cfirst in time, first in right\u201d (1848) and \u201creasonable use\u201d (1886), to \u201csafe yield\u201d (1903) and \u201cpublic trust\u201d (1930), to the more recent \u201c co-equal goals\u201d (2010).   5 Unsurprisingly these have proven contentious and led to the ongoing water wars that have defined the state\u2019s politics and determined its economy.\n Katherine Jenkins\u2019s photographs \u2014 taken along the California Aqueduct, which carries Sierra Nevada snowmelt southward via a network of dams, reservoirs, channels, and pumping plants, beginning in the San Joaquin-Sacramento Delta and ending in Lake Perris \u2014 depict what you might call scenes from the\u00a0frontlines\u00a0of the water wars. The reservoir of Lake Oroville, at a quarter of its capacity; the San Luis Reservoir at nineteen percent. A dessicated cornfield in the Delta. A pipe that\u2019s run dry in abandoned farmlands near Lost Hills, west of Bakersfield, and a pomegranate orchard sprouting from the parched earth, also in Lost Hills. Pipe arrays climbing treeless slopes. A dry canal. In all these scenes we see a system that\u2019s at once powerful, built to get water \u201cto where it is needed,\u201d and tenuous, as it runs up against non-negotiable limits.\n The\u00a0historian Leo Marx has argued that the concept of  technology refers not simply to machines but also to the ways in which industrial innovations have \u201ctransform[ed] the fundamental conditions of life.\u201d   6 In this sense technology refers also to logistics bureaucracies and capital resources, to political negotiations and legal agreements \u2014 and indeed to the American narratives of progress, control, and destiny. But now to this list we need to add strategies for  environmental adaptation and disaster mitigation. Jenkins\u2019s photographs might be viewed as a kind of visible inventory of these abstract practices and processes, a record of some of the artifacts by which California has, to use Stegner\u2019s terms, \u201cachieved itself.\u201d But now it\u2019s clear that if the state is to \u201coutlive its origins,\u201d future development will need to reconcile longstanding water interests with ecological imperatives that have emerged more lately. For as Stegner also wrote, \u201cEven an oasis civilization, if it tinkers enough with the environment, may be in danger of depleting and destroying it.\u201d   7\n  Wallace Stegner,  The Sound of Mountain Water: The Changing American West (original publication, 1969, reprint New York: E.P.

format in its Top News carousel last month. This means website owners no longer need to publish an extra set of pages written in the AMP format. Instead sites need to meet what Google calls &#34;Core Web Vitals.&#34;\n This sounds like great news. As a  long-time critic of Google AMP, I wish I could say that Google AMP is over and done with, but I&#39;m not convinced.\n As I wrote years ago when it launched, Google&#39;s AMP is bad \u2013 bad in a potentially web-destroying way. It&#39;s bad for how the web is built, it&#39;s bad for publishers of credible online content, and it&#39;s bad for consumers of that content. Google AMP is only good for one party: Google.\n   And make no mistake, AMP format pages did not just disappear from the web. It&#39;s great that AMP is no longer required to get in Google&#39;s coveted Top News carousel, but that doesn&#39;t mean AMP is gone.\n   Requiring publishers to use the AMP format for news is a moot point. All of the major purveyors of news already use AMP. Google doesn&#39;t need to require AMP because there&#39;s no one left to force into using it. Rolling back the AMP requirement isn&#39;t a sign of victory for the open web, it&#39;s a sign of defeat.\n     The other problem is that if you were a publisher interested in dropping support for AMP, Google News isn&#39;t the only game to consider.\n AMP links are widely used throughout other Google services, including Gmail, Google Images, and Google Search. Even though it&#39;s no longer required for Google News, around a month after Google&#39;s ranking changes took effect, almost every story currently in the Google News carousel is still using AMP.\n   All of which is to say that Google AMP was forced on publishers and, given no choice, publishers embraced it \u2013 so don&#39;t expect it to go away now just because it&#39;s no longer required. Big media publishers are slow to adopt and even slower to abandon.\n Unfortunately, I don&#39;t expect AMP links to disappear any time soon. You can always do the web a favour by installing a browser plugin to toss out the AMP URL and give you the link to the actual URL (I like  this one). It&#39;s a pain, but if we want to keep the web as AMP-free as possible, we&#39;re all going to have to do a little work.\n  Before I get into why AMP&#39;s replacement might be worse, it would help to back up and define what AMP is, because things have changed since it launched. AMP is now an open-source web component framework developed by the AMP Open Source Project. See Google anywhere in that sentence? No, no you don&#39;t. Google has distanced itself from AMP considerably over the years, but it hasn&#39;t given up control.\n Google AMP began with the stated goal of speeding up the web. The logic behind AMP goes like this: web developers suck at making fast websites, let&#39;s strip out all the stuff people don&#39;t need and cache it on our super-fast servers. That  sounds good. It&#39;s not hard to see how well-meaning people would get behind that idea. The problem is that being fast isn&#39;t what makes the web great. It&#39;s part of it, but it&#39;s not the most important part.\n Another common defence of AMP you&#39;ll hear is that it&#39;s open source. This is true, but also a non sequitur. There is nothing inherently good about something being open source. As web developer  Ferdy Christant put it back in 2018, the open source defence &#34;isn&#39;t just a weak defense, it&#39;s no defense at all. I can open-source a plan for genocide. The term &#39;open source&#39; is meaningless if the thing that is open source is harmful.&#34; Quite.\n   Since we&#39;ve now invoked something akin to  Godwin&#39;s Law, let&#39;s pause for a moment to address the question, is Google or AMP &#34;evil&#34;? I don&#39;t know. It doesn&#39;t matter. The people behind AMP might have had good intentions, they might not have. Google does not have to be &#34;evil&#34; for it to do things that harm the open web.\n  Regardless of motivation, the fact remains that the AMP developers produced something that is bad for the open web ecosystem because it destroys three sacrosanct elements of the web: the URL, the open web standard of HTML, and the decentralisation of the web.\n The URL is destroyed because when you visit an AMP page you visit a cached URL. Share that URL and the people who visit it will also visit the Google cache, not the publisher&#39;s URL. There is no web when that happens. There is just traffic coming to Google, which is good for... Google. To my mind this the biggest problem with AMP. The URL is the web. Literally. Without the URL you have nothing.\n AMP doesn&#39;t stop there; it also strips out all kinds of perfect valid, approved-by-standards-bodies HTML. Programmers hate HTML. It&#39;s messy, vague, imprecise, and user agents must deal with that, which is a huge pain for programmers. It&#39;s a valid criticism in many ways, but it also misses the fact that these are exactly the qualities that have enabled millions of people to use HTML. It&#39;s messy, vague, imprecise, and perfect for creating the web. What&#39;s more, it is developed very slowly, by many people, representing many points of view, many needs. AMP is a set of programming guidelines shoved down your throat by Google.\n The third problem with AMP is that it disrupts the web&#39;s decentralised design. This is really an outgrowth of the two things, but important in its own right when we start considering Google AMP&#39;s ostensible replacement, &#34;Core Web Vitals.&#34;\n Decentralisation means that no one entity controls web content. With AMP, Google gets total control of the content. Google hosts it, and Google alone knows who visits it.\n The final point is either ironic or, if you lean towards conspiracy, proof that Google knows exactly what it&#39;s doing here \u2013 namely, locking up content where Google can control it and mine users for data. Are you ready for it? Google AMP pages aren&#39;t any faster than regular HTML pages. Worse, they&#39;re often slower. Nope, not kidding. When AMP pages are faster, it&#39;s because Google is pre-loading them, which Google could do for any page on the web.\n Still, getting a spot in the Top News carousel of Google News is a powerful carrot, and it worked. Nearly every major publisher on the web (including this one) publishes AMP versions of their pages.\n Now AMP is no longer required of publishers, those of us shouting about how this is bad can just shut up now, right?\n Unfortunately, there are problems with AMP&#39;s replacement as well. And those problems go right back to what was wrong with AMP in the first place: Google is in charge of it.\n As web developer Ethan Marcotte  points out: &#34;While the shift to Core Web Vitals is a step in the right direction, it also means that Google alone determines what a &#39;great page experience&#39; means.&#34;\n Currently it  means your page should mostly load in 2.5 seconds. That&#39;s not a very high bar to be honest, but it is still a bar and the web does not do bars. Worse, that requirement might change tomorrow. Marcotte makes it clear that he thinks deprioritising AMP in favour of Core Web Vitals is a very good thing, but I&#39;m not so sure that&#39;s true. Neither, it seems, is Marcotte, who goes on to note that Google has &#34;taken its proprietary document format, and swapped it out for a proprietary set of performance statistics that has even less external oversight.&#34;\n  In the end AMP and Core Web Vitals boil down to a very simple reality: Google is again using its dominance in the search business to force everyone to play on its terms. Whether that&#39;s a proprietary markup language or some arbitrary set of performance standards, the end result is the same. Google is a monopoly and it is using its monopoly position to force the rest of the web into doing what it wants.\n Google AMP and its successor are classic examples that could have been pulled from another monopoly&#39;s playbook: embrace, extend, and extinguish. The difference is that Google is being much more clever about how it extinguishes things than Microsoft ever was. Google embraced HTML, then extended it with AMP and now, in claiming to have extinguished AMP, it gets the control it wants without the bad press. The slight twist in the extinguish move is a nice touch, Google. Well played.\n I&#39;ve said it  before, I&#39;ll say it again. The power of the web lies in its decentralisation, it lies with its messiness, it lies with its edge nodes \u2013 that is, with you and me. We rejected AMP, it may be fading, but we need to keep rejecting. If we reject Core Web Vitals, it too will die. \u00ae\n     UK artists seek &#39;luvvie levy&#39; on new gadgets to make up for all the media that consumers access online\n     Leading lights in the world of &#34;the arts&#34; have called for a techy tax on mobiles, laptops, and PCs to help finance creative industries they claim have been ravaged by lack of revenue and funding.\n  DACS \u2013 the visual artists&#39; rights management nonprofit \u2013 reckons a levy of 1-2 per cent on the sale of new tech gadgets could help raise \u00a3250m-\u00a3300m a year.\n  Part of the reasoning behind the initiative, it said, is that it would help redress the balance caused by people accessing music, films, and other creative material online without paying for it directly.\n  Continue reading\n  Panasonic&#39;s Toughbook G2 tablet will feature 10-finger touch even with gloves on and full Windows 11 compatibility.\n  Continue reading\n  Bezos v Branson: Battle of the wannabe Space Barons as Virgin Galactic cleared by FAA to start flying customers\n     A pair of rich white men look set to duke it out at the edge of space after Virgin Galactic was given the green light by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to fly customers to space.\n  Continue reading\n  Fujitsu wins \u00a39m contract hike for Oracle HR system running nearly 3 years late at Northern Ireland Education Authority\n     Fujitsu has been awarded a \u00a39.2m contract extension by the Northern Ireland Education Authority for changes to the implementation of an Oracle HR and payroll system that is already nearly three years late.\n  The project \u2013 first known as the EA Integrated Financial Management Information System, now dubbed EA One Project \u2013 began in 2015 with a \u00a320m contract award to the Japanese supplier.

Another deteriorating part of the decades-old Hubble Space Telescope has found itself in a jam. This time its camera unit is once again in the middle of a clash between scientists over whether or not the galaxy NGC 1052-DF2 contains any dark matter.\n  When DF2 was  written up in a  Nature paper in 2018, the study immediately raised eyebrows.

How could that be possible?\n  The mysterious substance is thought to be present in all galaxies, holding together glittering stars, swirls of dust and gas, and more, giving the galaxies structure and shape. Dark matter is a crucial component in theories of galactic formation, and finding a galaxy without this hidden stuff, or a very low quantity of it, breaks all the rules.

Announced by Linus Torvolds on Monday, the newest version is said to be one of the bigger releases in the version 5 range, with over 16 thousand commits made by over 2 thousand developers.\n For Mac users, the key addition to the kernel is support for a number of ARM-based chips, which crucially includes the  M1. The new kernel is therefore able to be run natively on Apple Silicon hardware, including the M1  Mac mini and the  24-inch iMac.\n While the ability to use M1 is included,  Phoronix  reports there&#39;s still more work to be done, including adding support for accelerated graphics. Other changes include a variety of updated drivers, architecture and file system improvements, and changes to process handling and tooling.\n  Linux 5.13 is not the first version of the operating system that works with the M1. In January,  security researchers at Corellium ported a version of Ubuntu to the chip, a process that required  many workarounds to get going, in part due to Apple&#39;s lack of documentation on how the chip functioned.\n Keep up with everything Apple in the weekly AppleInsider Podcast \u2014 and get a fast news update from AppleInsider Daily.

Yes, you can even play snake on it by typing  snake in the command line\n                             Similar to linux kbuild,  Winix supports verbose option, you can debug Makefile by setting verbose to 1\n    trace: &#34; type trace in bash to print all the syscalls in serial port 2", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:36:46", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf,years,\u5177\u6709", "title": "\u6211\u82b1\u4e865\u5e74\u5199\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf ", "title_en": "I spent 5 years writing my own operating system", "transed": 1, "url": "https://github.com/halfer53/winix", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf", "years", "\u5177\u6709"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "32953c5ed60201da5c5c3f840297db63.jpg", "infoid": 1068453, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u968f\u7740\u5173\u4e8eCovid-19\u8d77\u6e90\u7684\u4e3b\u6d41\u53d9\u4e8b\u5206\u5f00\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u662f\u65f6\u5019\u5c06\u5176\u5b83\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7f6e\u4e8e\u75c5\u6bd2 - \u4ee5\u53ca\u4ed6\u4eec\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u7406\u7684\u7834\u574f\u6027\u63aa\u65bd - \u5728\u540c\u6837\u7684\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e0b ", "note_en": "As the mainstream narrative about the origin of COVID-19 falls apart, it\u2019s time to put other widely accepted facts about the virus\u2014and the devastating measures they were used to justify\u2014under the same scrutiny", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:36:35", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u75c5\u6bd2,questions,\u5206\u5f00", "title": "\u66f4\u65b0\u6709\u5173\u75c5\u6bd2\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u96be\u4ee5\u9762\u5bf9\u7684\u7b54\u6848 ", "title_en": "Renewed questions about the virus, and hard-to-face answers", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/the-war-on-reality-gutentag", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u75c5\u6bd2", "questions", "\u5206\u5f00"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1068452, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u9f50\u68ee\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u601d\u60f3\u662f\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d8\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u5185\u5bb9\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u3002 \u8fd9\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u5982\u4f55\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u3002 \u6211\u4eec\u7b80\u5316\u4e86CodeBase Management  -  Unison\u6ca1\u6709\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u547d\u540d\u4e8b\u7269\u662f\u5fae\u4e0d\u8db3\u9053\u7684\u3002 \u540c\u4e00\u6838\u5fc3\u601d\u60f3\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f3a\u5927\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u4ee3\u7801\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5355\u4e00\u534f\u5b9a\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u6574\u4e2a\u5f39\u6027\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002  \u867d\u7136\u9f50\u58f0\u9f50\u58f0\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6027\u548c\u6b63\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u5206\u4eab\u65e9\u671f\u7684Alpha\u53d1\u5e03\u60a8\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4f9b\u60a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002 \u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u5728\u5f88\u5feb\u63a8\u51fa\u4e00\u822c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u91ca\u653e\u3002 \u4e0e\u6b64\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6b22\u8fce\u4efb\u4f55\u4eba\u5e2e\u52a9alpha\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002 ", "note_en": "Unison\u2019s core idea is that code is immutable and identified by its content.

", "note_en": "The biggest sea change in software development since the OO revolution is knocking at the door, and its name is Concurrency.\n This article appeared in   Dr. Dobb&#39;s Journal, 30(3), March 2005. A much briefer version under the title  &#34;The Concurrency Revolution&#34; appeared in   C/C++ Users Journal, 23(2), February 2005.\n Update note: The CPU trends graph last updated August 2009 to include current \rdata and show the trend continues as predicted. The rest of this article \rincluding all text is still original as first posted here in December 2004.\n   Your free lunch will soon be over. What can you do about it? What  are you doing about it?\n The major processor manufacturers and architectures, from Intel and AMD to Sparc and PowerPC, have run out of room with most of their traditional approaches to boosting CPU performance. Instead of driving clock speeds and straight-line instruction throughput ever higher, they are instead turning  en masse to hyperthreading and multicore architectures. Both of these features are already available on chips today; in particular, multicore is available on current PowerPC and Sparc IV processors, and is coming in 2005 from Intel and AMD. Indeed, the big theme of the 2004 In-Stat/MDR Fall Processor Forum was multicore devices, as many companies showed new or updated multicore processors. Looking back, its not much of a stretch to call 2004 the year of multicore.\n And that puts us at a fundamental turning point in software development, at least for the next few years and for applications targeting general-purpose desktop computers and low-end servers (which happens to account for the vast bulk of the dollar value of software sold today). In this article, Ill describe the changing face of hardware, why it suddenly does matter to software, and how specifically the concurrency revolution matters to you and is going to change the way you will likely be writing software in the future.\n Arguably, the free lunch has already been over for a year or two, only were just now noticing.\n  Theres an interesting phenomenon thats known as Andy giveth, and Bill taketh away. No matter how fast processors get, software consistently finds new ways to eat up the extra speed. Make a CPU ten times as fast, and software will usually find ten times as much to do (or, in some cases, will feel at liberty to do it ten times less efficiently). Most classes of applications have enjoyed free and regular performance gains for several decades, even without releasing new versions or doing anything special, because the CPU manufacturers (primarily) and memory and disk manufacturers (secondarily) have reliably enabled ever-newer and ever-faster mainstream systems. Clock speed isnt the only measure of performance, or even necessarily a good one, but its an instructive one: Were used to seeing 500MHz CPUs give way to 1GHz CPUs give way to 2GHz CPUs, and so on. Today were in the 3GHz range on mainstream computers.\n The key question is: When will it end? After all, Moores Law predicts exponential growth, and clearly exponential growth cant continue forever before we reach hard physical limits; light isnt getting any faster. The growth must eventually slow down and even end. (Caveat: Yes, Moores Law applies principally to transistor densities, but the same kind of exponential growth has occurred in related areas such as clock speeds. Theres even faster growth in other spaces, most notably the data storage explosion, but that important trend belongs in a different article.)\n If youre a software developer, chances are that you have already been riding the free lunch wave of desktop computer performance. Is your applications performance borderline for some local operations? Not to worry, the conventional (if suspect) wisdom goes; tomorrows processors will have even more throughput, and anyway todays applications are increasingly throttled by factors other than CPU throughput and memory speed (e.g., theyre often I/O-bound, network-bound, database-bound). Right?\n  The good news is that processors are going to continue to become more powerful. The bad news is that, at least in the short term, the growth will come mostly in directions that do not take most current applications along for their customary free ride.\n Over the past 30 years, CPU designers have achieved performance gains in three main areas, the first two of which focus on straight-line execution flow:\n     Increasing clock speed is about getting more cycles. Running the CPU faster more or less directly means doing the same work faster.\n Optimizing execution flow is about doing more work per cycle. Todays CPUs sport some more powerful instructions, and they perform optimizations that range from the pedestrian to the exotic, including pipelining, branch prediction, executing multiple instructions in the same clock cycle(s), and even reordering the instruction stream for out-of-order execution. These techniques are all designed to make the instructions flow better and/or execute faster, and to squeeze the most work out of each clock cycle by reducing latency and maximizing the work accomplished per clock cycle.\n Chip designers are under so much pressure to deliver ever-faster CPUs that theyll risk changing the meaning of your program, and possibly break it, in order to make it run faster\n  Brief aside on instruction reordering and memory models: Note that some of what I just called optimizations are actually far more than optimizations, in that they can change the meaning of programs and cause visible effects that can break reasonable programmer expectations. This is significant. CPU designers are generally sane and well-adjusted folks who normally wouldnt hurt a fly, and wouldnt think of hurting your code normally. But in recent years they have been willing to pursue aggressive optimizations just to wring yet more speed out of each cycle, even knowing full well that these aggressive rearrangements could endanger the semantics of your code. Is this Mr. Hyde making an appearance? Not at all. That willingness is simply a clear indicator of the extreme pressure the chip designers face to deliver ever-faster CPUs; theyre under so much pressure that theyll risk changing the meaning of your program, and possibly break it, in order to make it run faster. Two noteworthy examples in this respect are write reordering and read reordering: Allowing a processor to reorder write operations has consequences that are so surprising, and break so many programmer expectations, that the feature generally has to be turned off because its too difficult for programmers to reason correctly about the meaning of their programs in the presence of arbitrary write reordering. Reordering read operations can also yield surprising visible effects, but that is more commonly left enabled anyway because it isnt quite as hard on programmers, and the demands for performance cause designers of operating systems and operating environments to compromise and choose models that place a greater burden on programmers because that is viewed as a lesser evil than giving up the optimization opportunities.\n Finally, increasing the size of on-chip cache is about staying away from RAM. Main memory continues to be so much slower than the CPU that it makes sense to put the data closer to the processorand you cant get much closer than being right on the die. On-die cache sizes have soared, and today most major chip vendors will sell you CPUs that have 2MB and more of on-board L2 cache. (Of these three major historical approaches to boosting CPU performance, increasing cache is the only one that will continue in the near term. Ill talk a little more about the importance of cache later on.)\n  A fundamentally important thing to recognize about this list is that all of these areas are concurrency-agnostic. Speedups in any of these areas will directly lead to speedups in sequential (nonparallel, single-threaded, single-process) applications, as well as applications that do make use of concurrency. Thats important, because the vast majority of todays applications are single-threaded, for good reasons that Ill get into further below.\n Of course, compilers have had to keep up; sometimes you need to recompile your application, and target a specific minimum level of CPU, in order to benefit from new instructions (e.g., MMX, SSE) and some new CPU features and characteristics. But, by and large, even old applications have always run significantly fastereven without being recompiled to take advantage of all the new instructions and features offered by the latest CPUs.\n    CPU performance growth as we have known it hit a wall two years ago. Most people have only recently started to notice.\n You can get similar graphs for other chips, but Im going to use Intel data here. Figure 1 graphs the history of Intel chip introductions by clock speed and number of transistors. The number of transistors continues to climb, at least for now. Clock speed, however, is a different story.\n   Figure 1: \r\tIntel CPU Introductions (graph updated August 2009; article text original \r\tfrom December 2004)\n    Around the beginning of 2003, youll note a disturbing sharp turn in the previous trend toward ever-faster CPU clock speeds. Ive added lines to show the limit trends in maximum clock speed; instead of continuing on the previous path, as indicated by the thin dotted line, there is a sharp flattening. It has become harder and harder to exploit higher clock speeds due to not just one but several physical issues, notably heat (too much of it and too hard to dissipate), power consumption (too high), and current leakage problems.\n Quick: Whats the clock speed on the CPU(s) in your current workstation? Are you running at 10GHz? On Intel chips, we reached 2GHz a long time ago (August 2001), and according to CPU trends before 2003, now in early 2005 we should have the first 10GHz Pentium-family chips. A quick look around shows that, well, actually, we dont. Whats more, such chips are not even on the horizonwe have no good idea at all about when we might see them appear.\n Well, then, what about 4GHz? Were at 3.4GHz alreadysurely 4GHz cant be far away? Alas, even 4GHz seems to be remote indeed. In mid-2004, as you probably know, Intel first delayed its planned introduction of a 4GHz chip until 2005, and then in fall 2004 it officially abandoned its 4GHz plans entirely. As of this writing, Intel is planning to ramp up a little further to 3.73GHz in early 2005 (already included in Figure 1 as the upper-right-most dot), but the clock race really is over, at least for now; Intels and most processor vendors future lies elsewhere as chip companies aggressively pursue the same new multicore directions.\n Well probably see 4GHz CPUs in our mainstream desktop machines someday, but it wont be in 2005. Sure, Intel has samples of their chips running at even higher speeds in the labbut only by heroic efforts, such as attaching hideously impractical quantities of cooling equipment. You wont have that kind of cooling hardware in your office any day soon, let alone on your lap while computing on the plane.\n  There aint no such thing as a free lunch. R. A. Heinlein,  The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\n Does this mean Moores Law is over? Interestingly, the answer in general seems to be no. Of course, like all exponential progressions, Moores Law must end someday, but it does not seem to be in danger for a few more years yet. Despite the wall that chip engineers have hit in juicing up raw clock cycles, transistor counts continue to explode and it seems CPUs will continue to follow Moores Law-like throughput gains for some years to come.\n So a dual-core CPU that combines two 3GHz cores practically offers 6GHz of processing power. Right?\n Wrong. Even having two threads running on two physical processors doesnt mean getting two times the performance. Similarly, most multi-threaded applications wont run twice as fast on a dual-core box. They should run faster than on a single-core CPU; the performance gain just isnt linear, thats all.\n Why not? First, there is coordination overhead between the cores to ensure cache coherency (a consistent view of cache, and of main memory) and to perform other handshaking. Today, a two- or four-processor machine isnt really two or four times as fast as a single CPU even for multi-threaded applications. The problem remains essentially the same even when the CPUs in question sit on the same die.\n Second, unless the two cores are running different processes, or different threads of a single process that are well-written to run independently and almost never wait for each other, they wont be well utilized. (Despite this, I will speculate that todays single-threaded applications as actually used in the field could actually see a performance boost for most users by going to a dual-core chip, not because the extra core is actually doing anything useful, but because it is running the adware and spyware that infest many users systems and are otherwise slowing down the single CPU that user has today. I leave it up to you to decide whether adding a CPU to run your spyware is the best solution to that problem.)\n If youre running a single-threaded application, then the application can only make use of one core. There should be some speedup as the operating system and the application can run on separate cores, but typically the OS isnt going to be maxing out the CPU anyway so one of the cores will be mostly idle. (Again, the spyware can share the OSs core most of the time.)\n  The key difference, which is the heart of this article, is that the performance gains are going to be accomplished in fundamentally different ways for at least the next couple of processor generations. And most current applications will no longer benefit from the free ride without significant redesign.\n For the near-term future, meaning for the next few years, the performance gains in new chips will be fueled by three main approaches, only one of which is the same as in the past. The near-term future performance growth drivers are:\n     Hyperthreading is about running two or more threads in parallel inside a single CPU. Hyperthreaded CPUs are already available today, and they do allow some instructions to run in parallel. A limiting factor, however, is that although a hyper-threaded CPU has some extra hardware including extra registers, it still has just one cache, one integer math unit, one FPU, and in general just one each of most basic CPU features. Hyperthreading is sometimes cited as offering a 5% to 15% performance boost for reasonably well-written multi-threaded applications, or even as much as 40% under ideal conditions for carefully written multi-threaded applications. Thats good, but its hardly double, and it doesnt help single-threaded applications.\n Multicore is about running two or more actual CPUs on one chip. Some chips, including Sparc and PowerPC, have multicore versions available already. The initial Intel and AMD designs, both due in 2005, vary in their level of integration but are functionally similar. AMDs seems to have some initial performance design advantages, such as better integration of support functions on the same die, whereas Intels initial entry basically just glues together two Xeons on a single die. The performance gains should initially be about the same as having a true dual-CPU system (only the system will be cheaper because the motherboard doesnt have to have two sockets and associated glue chippery), which means something less than double the speed even in the ideal case, and just like today it will boost reasonably well-written multi-threaded applications. Not single-threaded ones.\n Finally, on-die cache sizes can be expected to continue to grow, at least in the near term. Of these three areas, only this one will broadly benefit most existing applications. The continuing growth in on-die cache sizes is an incredibly important and highly applicable benefit for many applications, simply because space is speed. Accessing main memory is expensive, and you really dont want to touch RAM if you can help it. On todays systems, a cache miss that goes out to main memory often costs 10 to 50 times as much getting the information from the cache; this, incidentally, continues to surprise people because we all think of memory as fast, and it is fast compared to disks and networks, but not compared to on-board cache which runs at faster speeds. If an applications working set fits into cache, were golden, and if it doesnt, were not. That is why increased cache sizes will save some existing applications and breathe life into them for a few more years without requiring significant redesign: As existing applications manipulate more and more data, and as they are incrementally updated to include more code for new features, performance-sensitive operations need to continue to fit into cache. As the Depression-era old-timers will be quick to remind you, Cache is king.\n (Aside: Heres an anecdote to demonstrate space is speed that recently hit my compiler team. The compiler uses the same source base for the 32-bit and 64-bit compilers; the code is just compiled as either a 32-bit process or a 64-bit one. The 64-bit compiler gained a great deal of baseline performance by running on a 64-bit CPU, principally because the 64-bit CPU had many more registers to work with and had other code performance features. All well and good. But what about data? Going to 64 bits didnt change the size of most of the data in memory, except that of course pointers in particular were now twice the size they were before. As it happens, our compiler uses pointers much more heavily in its internal data structures than most other kinds of applications ever would. Because pointers were now 8 bytes instead of 4 bytes, a pure data size increase, we saw a significant increase in the 64-bit compilers working set. That bigger working set caused a performance penalty that almost exactly offset the code execution performance increase wed gained from going to the faster processor with more registers. As of this writing, the 64-bit compiler runs at the same speed as the 32-bit compiler, even though the source base is the same for both and the 64-bit processor offers better raw processing throughput. Space is speed.)\n But cache is it. Hyperthreading and multicore CPUs will have nearly no impact on most current applications.\n So what does this change in the hardware mean for the way we write software? By now youve probably noticed the basic answer, so lets consider it and its consequences.\n  In the 1990s, we learned to grok objects. The revolution in mainstream software development from structured programming to object-oriented programming was the greatest such change in the past 20 years, and arguably in the past 30 years. There have been other changes, including the most recent (and genuinely interesting)  naissance of web services, but nothing that most of us have seen during our careers has been as fundamental and as far-reaching a change in the way we write software as the object revolution.\n  Starting today, the performance lunch isnt free any more. Sure, there will continue to be generally applicable performance gains that everyone can pick up, thanks mainly to cache size improvements. But if you want your application to benefit from the continued exponential throughput advances in new processors, it will need to be a well-written  concurrent (usually multithreaded) application. And thats easier said than done, because not all problems are inherently parallelizable and because concurrent programming is hard.\n I can hear the howls of protest: Concurrency? Thats not news! People are already writing concurrent applications. Thats true. Of a small fraction of developers.\n Remember that people have been doing object-oriented programming since at least the days of Simula in the late 1960s. But OO didnt become a revolution\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:35:59", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u514d\u8d39,\u8f6f\u4ef6,\u5348\u9910,lunch,cpu", "title": "\u514d\u8d39\u5348\u9910\u7ed3\u675f\uff1a\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5e76\u53d1\u7684\u6839\u672c\u8f6c\u5411\uff082005\uff09 ", "title_en": "The free lunch is over: a fundamental turn toward concurrency in software (2005)", "transed": 1, "url": "http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u514d\u8d39", "\u8f6f\u4ef6", "\u5348\u9910", "lunch", "cpu"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "77439563f3226e3623b6ec7772bd0d99.png", "infoid": 1068450, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u5904\u7406MKDIR / RMDIR / LN\u7b49\u5e38\u89c4\u6587\u4ef6\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u5199\u5165FileSdoes\u4e0d\u5b58\u50a8\u4efb\u4f55\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6587\u4ef6\u5927\u5c0f\u4fdd\u5b58\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4ece\u6587\u4ef6\u8bfb\u53d6\u7684\u8bfb\u53d6\u8868\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e/ dev / zot feed\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u5927\u5c0f\u3002\n \u5199\u4f5c\u548c\u8bfb\u6570\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b28\u86cb\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u9700\u8981\u76ee\u5f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86arkernel\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u7194\u4e1d\uff0c\u7edd\u5bf9\u6ca1\u6709\u4ece\u7528\u6237\u5230\u5185\u6838\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u798f\u97f3\u5e94\u7528\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6267\u884c\u5199\u5165orread\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\n   \uff03makemake -c /llib/modules/4.18.5/build m = / home / abi / lwnfs modulesmake [1]\uff1a\u8f93\u5165\u76ee\u5f55\uff06\uff0339; /usr/src/linux-headers-4.18.5&#39;\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u9636\u6bb52.

", "note_en": "Since YouTube is the dominant video platform, a lot has already been said about its copyright claims system. Most of that has had to do with questions about what constitutes fair use (in movie reviews, for instance). Google\u2019s AI is mostly trained to recognize the presence or non-presence of content in your video, not whether or not your use is fair (something that varies between jurisdictions, by the way). But what I\u2019m going to discuss here is much more clear-cut: the performance of public domain music.\n While there\u2019s certainly artistic merit in new compositions, there are also a lot of us who enjoy performing existing classical music. Luckily for us, there\u2019s lots of that in the public domain. The boundaries of what\u2019s fallen out of copyright depend on the country, but virtually everything published in the nineteenth century and earlier is free for everyone to use.\n Unfortunately, Google seems not to be aware of this fact. Recently, I uploaded a production of Gilbert and Sullivan\u2019s   Trial by Jury to YouTube, and it instantly got hit by four copyright claims. I went to go contest them \u2014 something I\u2019ve done before for this kind of thing, and always with success for public domain music \u2014 but that really shouldn\u2019t be necessary.  Trial was first published in the 1870s. Gilbert and Sullivan died in 1911 and 1900, respectively. As far as I know, this opera isn\u2019t under copyright anywhere in the world.\n Of course, while the music is definitely in the public domain, new recordings can definitely be under copyright. If I\u2019d uploaded a copyrighted D\u2019Oyly Carte Company performance of  Trial, I\u2019d expect a copyright claim \u2014 it\u2019d be totally justified. But that\u2019s not what I did! In fact, the recording I uploaded was an entirely new one (in which I was myself involved). Maybe it got confused with another performance? Nope! YouTube flagged four segments as  using the melody of \u201ccopyrighted\u201d songs \u2014 but all the compositions on which I had supposedly infringed were just numbers from  Trial!\n So the AI is good. It correctly identified what I was using, and that I\u2019d uploaded a new recording using a melodies from Google\u2019s database of copyrighted compositions. The only problem is that these melodies  aren\u2019t copyrighted.\n Could Google fix this? Probably. One way to do this could be by producing a database of public domain compositions (a sort of public domain flagger to face off against the copyright flagger), but this would be a difficult undertaking. Much simpler would be requiring some minimal information from contributors to the database of copyrighted compositions, such as composer, librettist (when applicable), publication date and so on.\n Of course, Google isn\u2019t likely to do anything of the sort, since they have no real reason to treat performers of public domain music fairly: we can\u2019t sue just because we got a copyright claim against our video, while publishers can sue for copyright infringement (and fair enough, when they actually hold a copyright). So, until the 30-day appeal period (appeals are to the claimant!) expires, some copyright troll is making money off of ads running on our new production of a public domain opera. And even more copyright trolls are definitely out there making what is likely a substantial amount of money off of stuff they definitely don\u2019t own from people who don\u2019t contest the claims (or don\u2019t know how to).
