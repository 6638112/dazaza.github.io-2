", "note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  Alcohol powder or  powdered alcohol or  dry alcohol is a product generally made using  micro-encapsulation. When reconstituted with water,  alcohol (specifically ethanol) in powder form becomes an  alcoholic drink. In March 2015 four product labels for specific powdered alcohol products were approved by the United States Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) which opened the doors for legal product sales. However, as of 4 January 2016, the product is not yet available for sale and legalization remains controversial due to public-health and other concerns.  [1] Researchers have expressed concern that, should the product go into production, increases in alcohol misuse, abuse, and associated physical harm to its consumers could occur above what has been historically associated with liquid alcohol alone.\n    In 1966 \u00a0( ) Sato Foods Industries Co., Ltd. invented alcohol pulverization. Sato is a food additives and seasoning manufacturer in  Aichi Pref., Japan. ( ja:\u4f50\u85e4\u98df\u54c1\u5de5\u696d (\u611b\u77e5\u770c))   [3] A year later, in 1967, Sato began production and sales of various kinds of &#34;high content alcohol powder  Alcock&#34; (&#34;\u9ad8\u542b\u5ea6\u30a2\u30eb\u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u7c89\u672b\u300c \u30a2\u30eb\u30b3\u30c3\u30af\u300d&#34;).  [3]\n On 15 January 1974, a practical manufacturing process for alcohol powder was patented by Sato.  [4]  [5]  [6]  [7] Sato has  patented the process in 17 countries around the world.  [8]  [9]  [10]\n In the 1970s Sato began promoting powdered alcohol in the United States. Test sales began in 1977 under the trade name &#34;SureShot&#34;.  [11]  [12] The product &#34;Palcohol&#34; was announced for future release in the U.S. in 2015.\n  Officially, Sato says that its products are for business use only, for example for the use of food-processing industries or food-and-drink businesses (e.g. restaurant, caf\u00e9,  sweets shop,  bakery shop, etc.). Mainly, its products are to be used as food additives. Other than purposes for test sale, research, etc., it has never been sold for eating or drinking, including personal use or home use.  [9]  [13]\n In June 1982, Sato started production and sales for the drinking powdered alcohol, as test case. Its name is &#34;powdered cocktail  Alcock-Light cocktail&#34; (&#34;\u7c89\u672b\u30ab\u30af\u30c6\u30eb   &#39;\u30a2\u30eb\u30b3\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30ab\u30af\u30c6\u30eb&#39; &#34;).  [3]  [14] At least, during some years, it seems that had continued to test sales.  [15]  [16]\n  Powdered alcohol would generally share the health risks that are associated with traditional liquid alcohol consumption, although there may be some differences in its effects related to differences in consumption potency, differences in characteristics for storage, concealability, and portability, lack of familiarity, and potentially novel delivery methods. Excessive consumption of alcohol can result in acute overdose, intoxication-related accidental injury, compromised judgment, and longer-term negative health consequences including liver disease, cancer, and physiologic dependence.  [17]\n  As with the public health concerns, the following concerns have been posed but data are not yet available to prove or disprove them. Because of the unique characteristics of powdered alcohol, introduction in the U.S. could raise significant concerns from alcohol retailers as it will raise the awareness of their customers health and well as a major priority. including such as restaurants, bars, and sporting venues,  [18] including:\n Availability of powdered alcohol could negatively affect retailers&#39; economic interests as customers might now have the ability to purchase less relatively expensive and safer alcohol from those businesses by augmenting their purchased liquid alcohol drinks with cheaper powdered alcohol mixtures purchased elsewhere.\n Use of powdered alcohol by customers could increase responsibility of these businesses&#39; by increasing the accuracy and abilities to monitor their customers&#39; alcohol consumption - which they are legally required to do to try to prevent the consumption of alcohol by intoxicated or under-age customers. This could hold them at a greater responsibility out of concern of civil-liability lawsuits (because retailers are held liable for alcohol-attributable harms caused by customers who should not have been served alcohol).\n     An auxiliary material for a capsule may be any readily water-soluble substance (e.g.  carbohydrate such as  dextrins ( starch  hydrolyzate),  protein such as  gelatin). For powdered alcohol,  maltodextrin (a type of dextrin) was chosen.\n  In this process, a  mixture of dextrin and alcohol is subjected to simultaneous spraying and heating. The spraying converts the liquid to small drops (up to several hundred  \u03bcm (micrometers) in diameter), and the heat causes the hydrous dextrin to form a film. When the film dries, the drop becomes a microcapsule containing alcohol and dextrin.\n Before and after drying, comparing the amounts of water and alcohol, about 90% of water is removed and about 10% of ethyl alcohol is lost.  [15] One of the reasons which are considered, is the following.\n In mixtures such as this, the speed of molecule movement is dependent on molecule size and  carbohydrate (in this case, maltodextrin) concentration. Water, the smallest molecule in the mixture, is able to move and evaporate fastest. In higher concentration, by decreasing water, water molecules can move much faster. After the film formed it is less permeable to larger molecules than water. By the time the film is completed, water has evaporated enough. This phenomenon is called &#34; selective diffusion.&#34;  [20]\n In general, after sprayed, encapsulation for each drop is completed within about 0.1 second from the very beginning of the process. There is no time for the internal convection in each drop or capsule to occur.  [15]\n Ultimately, large amounts of microcapsules have been produced. These become the powdery matter called powdered alcohol or alcohol powder. According to Sato&#39;s web page, powdered alcohol contains 30.5% ethyl alcohol by volume in the state of powder.  [10]\n In addition to the mixture before drying, if necessary, other additives (e.g. extract, sweetener, spices, coloring matter, etc.) may be added.\n As a result, alcohol powder can be said to be an alcoholic beverage that is &#34; dry&#34;.For example, a &#34;dry  martini&#34; made from alcohol powder may be referred to as a &#34; dry dry martini&#34; or &#34; dried dry martini&#34;.  [11]\n   Typically, when considering the quality of a powdered product such as  coffee,  freeze drying seems to be better than spray drying, but this does not apply to alcohol powder production. In fact, &#34; freeze-dried beer spice&#34; was made by university students for their research.  Carbon dioxide, water and alcohol have all been lost.  [22]\n Due to the  volatility of alcohol, relatively higher than water, time-consuming methods, such as freeze drying, should not be used. By selective diffusion, loss of alcohol is relatively small.\n  In 2014, an article on the website PopSci.com published instructions on how to make pulverized alcohol easily, through a simple mixture of alcohol and dextrin.  [23]\n In this method, the powder is not encapsulated, and also not yet fully dried. Consequently, alcohol continues to evaporate from it very rapidly.\n Due to flaws in the powdered alcohol produced by this method, this form of powdered alcohol was said to be unsuitable for drinking, carrying, or preserving.\n Any production of powdered alcohol without a license is illegal in Japan, even if it is only for personal use, according to the Liquor Tax Act of Japan.\n   Currently, the alcoholic beverage industry in Japan is large and powerful. [   citation needed] [   opinion] For example, in fiscal year 2013,  Suntory, one of the country&#39;s largest beverage companies, recorded sales of 570.7 billion  yen (about US$4.7 billion) in alcoholic beverages, excluding wine  [24] Currently, the sales revenue from powdered alcohol has been too small to affect the sales of liquid-alcohol companies. Additionally, powdered alcohol&#39;s market share is currently too small to be considered as a statistical item in Japanese tax reports.  [25]\n Powdered alcohol is found in some mass production foods, used in small amounts (as are other additives).\n  In 1977, the  Associated Press delivered the first news story in the United States about powdered alcohol, which was then an unprecedented product. Investors were quoted as saying that they &#34;hope[d] to revolutionize the liquor business with a product that&#39;s easy to carry, cheap and potent&#34;. A test sale of powdered alcohol, called &#34;SureShot&#34;, was done in the United States.  [11]  [12]  [26]\n  According to  food chemist Udo Pollmer of the European Institute of Food and Nutrition Sciences in  Munich, alcohol can be absorbed in  cyclodextrins, a synthetic carbohydrate  derivative. In this way, encapsuled in small capsules, the fluid can be handled as a powder. The cyclodextrins can absorb an estimated 60 percent of their own weight in alcohol.  [27] A US  patent was registered for the process as early as 1974.  [28]\n   Nebulizer: Alcohol powder produced through molecular encapsulation with  cyclodextrin can be used with a  nebulizer  [30] though this could be dangerous.\n    Powdered alcohol is illegal in the state of  Victoria, as of 1 July 2015.  [31] As of the Liquor (Undesirable Liquor Product - Powdered Alcohol) Amendment Regulation 2018, made under the Liquor Act 1992, Powdered Alcohol in Queensland was banned and pronounced illegal.  [32] The NSW Government also recognises powdered alcohol an undesirable product under the Liquor Regulation Act 2018.  [33]\n   The product was available in four flavors and packed in 65-gram, or possibly 100-gram, sachets. When mixed with 0.25 liters of water, it created a drink with 4.8% alcohol. It was assumed that a German producer manufactured the  alcopop powder based on imported raw alcohol powder from the U.S.  [34]\n   The Japanese Liquor Tax Act ( ja:\u9152\u7a0e\u6cd5) amendment of April 1981  [36]  [26] classifies powdered alcohol as an alcoholic beverage. In the production of powdered alcohol some non-alcoholic ingredients are added which is similar to some liqueurs. Nonetheless, powdered alcohol became a separate category of alcoholic beverages.\n In May 1981, Sato received the first license to produce alcohol powder commercially. In Japan, powdered alcohol is officially called,  funmatsu-shu  (  ja:\u7c89\u672b\u9152, lit. &#39;powdered-alcoholic beverage&#39;).  [3]Powdered alcohol is defined by law as a &#34;powdery substance that can be dissolved, and can make a beverage containing 1% or more alcohol by volume&#34;.  [37]\n Before the 1981 amendment, powdered alcohol was outside the scope of Liquor Tax, as it is not a liquid.  [14]\n  In 2007, four food technology students in the  Netherlands invented a powdered alcohol product called &#34;Booz2go&#34;.  [38] They claimed that when mixed with water, the powder would produce a bubbly, lime-colored and  lime-flavored drink, with 3% alcohol. When put into commercial production, it was expected to sell for \u20ac1.50 (approx.  US$1.60) for a 20\u00a0gram sachet.\n The product&#39;s creators and marketers \u2013 Harm van Elderen, Martyn van Nierop, and others at Helicon Vocational Institute in  Boxtel \u2013 claimed to be aiming at the youth market. They compared the drink to alcopops like  Bacardi Breezer and said they expected the relatively low alcohol content would be popular with the young segment.\n Because of complexities in Dutch laws, powdered alcohol like Booz2Go would not be subject to the Alcohol and  Horeca Code, because it is not literally an alcoholic drink. This means that anybody of any age could buy it legally. However, when dissolved in water, it would be subject to the Code, according to Director Wim van Dalen of the Dutch National Foundation for Alcohol Prevention. Von Dalen commented that while he generally did not support new alcoholic drinks, he doubted the powder would become attractive. A spokesman of the  Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport said they would not undertake any actions against the product, but added that the label would have to contain a warning about any health risks for the consumer, in accordance with other laws.  [39]\n    According to one Russian news site, in 2009, a Professor at  Saint Petersburg Technological University named Yevgeny Moskalev invented and patented a method of creating alcohol powder. This method could make alcohol powder from any kind of alcoholic beverage.  [41]\n  The method was tested on 96% spirit vodka. In this method, melted wax ( stearic acid) is stirred, and the alcoholic drink is poured in. The solution dissipates and becomes drops containing alcohol and wax. The drops that solidify constitute alcohol powder.\n It was proposed that Moskalev&#39;s powdered alcohol could be wrapped in paper and carried around in a pocket or a bag. In addition, a pill form, containing alcohol, was also made with this method.\n Professor Moskalev responded: &#34;powdered vodka tastes like a candle&#34;; &#34;I did not like vodka in pills&#34;; and, in conclusion, &#34;vodka is best consumed the old way&#34;.\n  In 2008, Pulver Spirits began developing a line of alcohol powder products to be marketed in the United States. The marketing was reportedly intended to be in full compliance with alcohol regulations and targeted at adults of legal drinking age.  [42]\n In Spring 2014, the Arizona-based company Lipsmark LLC announced that it would start marketing powdered alcohol under the name &#34;Palcohol&#34;, a  portmanteau of  powder +  alcohol.  [43] This caused considerable controversy, after the product was approved by the TTB for sale. This approval was later attributed to a &#34;labeling error&#34;, and the manufacturer surrendered the approvals.  [44]\n In March, 2015, the U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) approved four powdered alcohol products with the brand name &#34;Palcohol&#34; for sale in the U.S.  [45] Under the  Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution, state and territory governments also have substantial regulatory powers over &#34;intoxicating liquors&#34;, especially regarding retail sales and sales to minors.  [46] Shortly after the TTB approval was announced, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) responded to inaccurate reports implying that it had approved powdered alcohol as being safe. The FDA clarified that its role was to evaluate the nonalcoholic ingredients and that based on its evaluation of specific powdered alcohol products it had no legal basis to block their entry into the U.S. market.  [47]\n In 2014, Ohio state legislators introduced legislation that would ban Palcohol and all other powdered alcohol.  [48] The following year, Iowa state legislators followed suit.  [49]\n  On 25 March 2015, alcohol wholesalers and distributors in the state of Maryland announced an agreement to voluntarily ban the distribution and sale of powdered alcohol.  [51] Concerns included the potential for abuse by minors, the ease of using the powder to bring alcohol into public events or to  spike drinks, and the potential to  snort the powder. At the same time, a bill to ban Palcohol for one year was under consideration in the Maryland House of Delegates.\n  By November 2015, most states had introduced legislation and laws to regulate or ban powdered alcohol. Twenty-seven have banned powdered alcohol, 2 more have placed temporary 1-year bans on the product and 3 have included powdered alcohol under their statutory definitions of alcohol meaning that it is covered by existing alcohol regulations.  [53] [   needs update]\n  The legal status of powdered alcohol in United Kingdom is uncertain, although parliament saw no dangers from the sale of powdered alcohol, aside from the loss of tax revenue.  [54] In a January 2015 answer to a  parliamentary question,  Lord Bates wrote &#34;The Government is aware of powdered alcohol from media reports and the banning of the product in five states of the United States of America. The Government is aware of powdered alcohol being marketed and made available in the coming years to buy in England and  Wales.&#34;  [55]\n  ^     a     b     c     d   \u6709\u4fa1\u8a3c\u5238\u5831\u544a\u66f8(Financial statement) ( in Japanese) Sato Foods Industries Co., Ltd.

Let&#39;s run through interesting parallels between the two, and how you can apply some lessons from improv to build better product.\n Improv comedy is a kind of theatre where performers create unscripted scenes based on prompts from the audience. I&#39;ve been doing improv for 3 years and I often catch myself thinking that the framework used in improv applies to product pretty well.\n   The base reality in any improv scene is the &#34;who, what, where&#34; of the characters on stage. For example, a base reality could be two friends (who) having lunch (what) in a park (where). When you&#39;re on stage with eyes peered on you, there&#39;s a natural  rush to be funny but we need to resist. The base reality needs to be laid first and in fact, it doesn&#39;t need to be funny. It needs to be clear and serve as a neutral background for the funny things to contrast against.\n The key product lesson is that you should understand the world you are in before you do anything else. This is the base reality of your product. Who are your customers? What are their problems? What do they do about these problems? What part of the existing solutions will you  not change? Resist the natural  rush to be creative with features, designs, engineering  - and first observe and understand your base reality. The base reality  shouldn&#39;t be innovative and you should be careful about contriving it to be what you wish. Be specific and truthful. Here are some examples of base realities.\n   Once a base reality is established, improv performers look to find  the game. This is the  unusual thing that stands out, and everything funny revolves around. It&#39;s really important for improvisers to explicitly  frame the game (with a shocked reaction, a confused question, a dramatic pause and so on) so everyone (including the audience) understands what&#39;s unusual.\n In this sketch, the line &#34;Are there any women here today?&#34; explicitly frames the unusual thing. There are indeed women dressed as men.\n It&#39;s similarly really important that you pause and get explicit about your product  game. Be clear and aligned as a team about your unusual insights and beliefs. These will likely be your most critical assumptions and form the basis of your innovation. Your insight could be a specific take on the problem, the technical approach, the distribution, the trends in the space, and so on. Here&#39;re some examples.\n   There&#39;s a natural tendency in improv to bring in  lots of  games because we&#39;re afraid about  not being funny enough. However, the funniest scenes are funny not because they have multiple games, but because they take a focused game to places no one (even the performers) expects. Improvisors do just that by exploring the game (&#34;if this is true, why is it true?&#34;) or heightening it (&#34;if this is true, what else is true?&#34;).\n In this sketch, the game is constant disagreement, and that&#39;s it. Everything else is totally normal.\n This is an important lesson with product too. Resist the temptation to bring in  lots of games because you want to  hedge your bets or because  it all looks exciting. Do less, and take it places no one (including you) can expect. Wonder &#34;why&#34; to explore the deeper rationale behind your key insights and reason from first principles. Wonder &#34;what else&#34; to heighten your key insights by deducing second (and n) order impact and peripheral ideas.\n  Some improv scenes are initiated with a generic line and performers extract the game organically. e.g. &#34;I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s midnight&#34; is an intriguing start to a scene but there&#39;s no obvious game. In contrast, some improv scenes are initiated with strong game right away. e.g. initiating the scene with &#34;No, you&#39;re an accountant, you can&#39;t just become a lion tamer&#34;. Both ways can lead to hilarious scenes.\n Likewise, some products are initiated with a rough idea. This is in the camp of  Eric Reis&#39; model, where you&#39;re lean, get feedback, and iterate quickly. The idea is to treat the path to product market fit as a series of experiments with hypotheses. In contrast, there is  Keith Rabois&#39; model, where you have a strong vision from day 0 and not much changes from then. The idea is that you have a master plan from the start, and you get heads down on executing it. Check this  post by Casey Winters comparing these models with far more nuance.\n Of course, ideally you should find your product game  as soon as possible to leave more room to explore or heighten. However, you shouldn&#39;t use not knowing your game from day 0 as an excuse to to not get started. You should start building your base reality  today and see what surfaces. OpenDoor succeeded with strong initial premise, but Slack and Segment discovered their game over time.\n  There are a few things we can learn from improv to build better product.

We plan to pick classics from the field of mathematics and computation, and read them together. The books and literature we pick for reading are of slightly offbeat nature, hence the name of this club! Our focus is on picking reading material about concepts and technologies that have been around for a long time and have an air of timelessness around them.\n  In particular, we will not be chasing the latest trends in technology most of the time. But we are not a retrocomputing club either. For example, we are likely not going to talk about BASIC programming on Commodore 64. The topics we pick for our club meetings are largely going to be topics that are still quite relevant and important in the field of mathematics and computation but they may not be what is considered to be mainstream. For example, we will read books like  Introduction to Analytic Number Theory or talk about Common Lisp programming. Sometimes these topics may intersect with modern trends or retrocomputing but most of the times they would not. That is the kind of sweet spot we want to hit.\n    Here is a little bit of history about our community. This community was born on the Freenode IRC network when I announced on the  ##algorithms and  ##math channels there that I would be hosting book club meetings on analytic number theory. I created a makeshift channel named  #susam to discuss the book club activities and plan the meeting schedule. Several members joined this channel and the book club was formed.\n  Our first meeting occurred via IRC on 4 Mar 2021. We realized that it would be much more efficient to discuss mathematics via audio along with a shared desktop session where we can use some software tool to scribble out and render mathematics formulas using LaTeX. So on the next day, that is, on 5 Mar 2021, we had our first web meeting via Zoom. Later, after  an announcement on Hacker News, some members from the Hacker News community joined our club too and the community grew a little bit more as a result.\n  During the web meetings in the initial days of this club, I hacked up a tiny non-WSYIWYG tool that helped in typing out LaTeX code quickly and have it rendered on a pane using MathJax. This helped us to scribble mathematics quickly while understanding the concepts we came across in the book. This tool continued to evolve with our book club and it was soon released as  Muboard. We use it often during our meetings.\n    We moved to Libera IRC later and continued to operate out of a makeshift channel. It has now been more than 3 months since we began these meetings. Although our community is tiny, the meetings have been going on consistently and we have learnt numerous new and interesting concepts and theorems in the field of analytic number theory. After 3 months of successful meetings, today, that is, on 15 Jun 2021, I decided to create a more permanent place for our community with a name that represents our community better. This new community is now called the  Offbeat Computation Club. I believe this new name represents the nature of our community and our meetings.\n  In this community, we pick classics from the field of mathematics and computation and read them together. We are now operating out of the  #offbeat channel on Libera IRC.\n    Since this club began, we have made good progress with the study of analytic number theory. The meetings for this topic have been going on consistencly. I have a little more free time now, so I can add a few more parallel meetings on other topics. Emacs and Lisp are on the top of my mind. I will plan something out and post an update soon. In the meantime, if any community member is interested to host their own book club meetings, we will have them added too to our schedule.\n    Join our channel  #offbeat on Libera Chat and be a part of our club activities. Alternatively, you can also join our channel via its Matrix bridge at  #offbeat:libera.chat. Both the channel link and the bridge link point to the same channel, so you need to join only one of them, not both. If you are not an active IRC user, prefer joining the Matrix bridge because it is more convenient for someone unfamiliar with IRC.

The fintech company has raised more than $60 million in equity funding since its founding in 2013. Splash was previously known as GradSchoolLoans until a rebranding in 2016.\n The firm said the Series B round was led by partners of DST Global, Citi Ventures, Detroit Venture Partners and Firebolt Ventures, as well as existing investors CMFG Ventures and Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures.\n Splash founder and CEO Steven Muszynski said the investment will help expand the platform&#39;s lending network and automated underwriting platform. Both are critical pillars of the business, which features a hybrid marketplace model whereby users can shop for and compare rates when looking to refinance their loans.\n &#34;I think this shows the confidence our investors have in what we&#39;re doing in trying to help people shop and save money when it comes to their financial goals,&#34; Muszynski said. &#34;I think as the world is opening up post-COVID, and as companies are trying to expand and grow quickly, raising this level of capital provides greater opportunity for faster expansion, whether that&#39;s expanding the team with talent or consumer marketing, or expanding products and lending partners. The money just allows you to do a lot to be able to make a large impact in the space.&#34;\n  Muszynski declined to share details of the current revenue picture. However, the firm did tell Crain&#39;s in December its monthly revenue had  spiked 2,150% over the prior 18 months.\n That&#39;s noteworthy considering the pause in collections for many student loans during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 the idea being that fewer people might turn to refinancing when their payments are delayed, thereby decreasing its potential market of users.\n  &#34;We continue to see significant growth. And I think there is a mass shift in consumer behavior where they want to shop and save from their homes,&#34; he said, referencing the accelerated adoption of digital banking during the pandemic. &#34;We have some major tailwinds propelling this industry forward.&#34;\n Building on its offerings, Splash this month launched a network of lenders for borrowers still in school. Muszynski said the company plans to unveil other lending products in the coming months.\n The outlook for this business excites Splash investors and others looking for a piece of the student loan refinancing industry.\n Among many playing in this space, Cleveland&#39;s KeyBank, for instance, in 2019  acquired Laurel Road, a student loan refinancing platform that specializes in borrowers in the health care field (like doctors and dentists). Key has seen strong revenue from Laurel Road, which is one of Splash&#39;s many partners, and this spring expanded the platform into a  digital affinity bank for health care workers, offering additional lending products.\n &#34;The importance and sophistication of digital lenders is growing apace,&#34; said Charley Howe, director of venture investing at Citi Ventures, in a statement. &#34;Splash Financial is spearheading a digital transformation strategy that will meet the new demands of consumers. We see significant growth potential in the continued evolution of the lending experience, and we are thrilled to support Splash&#39;s next phase of growth.&#34;\n Splash has about 120 employees. About 60% of those are working out of Cleveland, with others spread out and working remotely from other parts of the country. Muszynski anticipates doubling the total workforce over the next 12 months.\n This fundraise by Splash likely will be among the largest venture capital deals this year in Northeast Ohio.\n According to  data compiled by PwC and CB Insights, the largest VC deal in Northeast Ohio in 2020 went to  Within3 of Lakewood, which raised $100 million in the third quarter. The next largest in this market after that went to  Neuros Medical of Willoughby, which raised $42.8 million in the fourth quarter.\n The largest VC deal in the state last year came with Columbus&#39;  Olive, which raised $382.5 million over three rounds in 2020.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 11:08:29", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8d37\u6b3e,led", "title": "Splash Financial\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u4ece\u4e8b\u5b66\u751f\u8d37\u6b3e\u518d\u878d\u8d44\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u8d37\u6b3e\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7531DST\u5168\u7403\uff0c\u82b1\u65d7\u4f01\u4e1a\u548c\u66f4\u591a\u7684B\u9886\u5bfc44.3M\u7cfb\u5217B.

", "note_en": "The recent ransomware attacks on Colonial Pipeline and the meat processing giant JBS, both attributed to Russian cybercrime gangs, as well as the SolarWinds espionage campaign that intelligence agencies linked to Moscow, thrust cybersecurity into the spotlight on Capitol Hill and prompted renewed scrutiny of the challenges facing the federal government, including its limited understanding of attacks on private companies.\n Washington is slowly responding to the crisis. In mid-May,  Biden signed an executive order intended to close federal security gaps and increase oversight of the contractors that often serve as backdoors into agency networks. Two weeks later,  the TSA issued a security directive requiring pipeline operators to report cyberattacks.  A bipartisan group of senators is now planning legislation to require a wide range of businesses to report breaches.\n Inglis\u2019 new White House office was one of several policy reforms recommended by the congressional chartered Cyberspace Solarium Commission and incorporated into the fiscal 2021 defense policy bill. Lawmakers envisioned the office as analogous to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in terms of elevating the importance of cyber issues within the White House.\n But Congress did not define Inglis\u2019 exact portfolio or authorities, and it remains unclear how he will work with Anne Neuberger, Biden\u2019s deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology. During the presidential transition,  Biden aides bristled at Congress\u2019 creation of a new Senate-confirmed White House position and argued unsuccessfully that cyber coordination should remain the domain of the National Security Council.\n But many on the Hill wanted more continuity and stability in the White House\u2019s approach to cyber issues. The Obama administration had created a cyber coordinator position inside the NSC, but the Trump administration had eliminated that role, calling it unnecessary. That move generated a fierce backlash and led to the Solarium Commission developing the contours of the national cyber director office.\n Inglis, who served on the Solarium Commission, became an early frontrunner for the position. An Air Force veteran who spent nearly 30 years at the NSA, including serving as its deputy director from 2006 to 2014, Inglis developed strong relationships with key lawmakers and earned bipartisan respect on Capitol Hill.\n \u201cHe has a quiet but persuasive leadership style,\u201d Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), a Solarium Commission co-chair, said during Inglis\u2019 confirmation hearing. \u201cAll of us have been in meetings where there\u2019s one person, when they begin to speak, you lean over and say, \u2018Now, what are they going to say? Because this is going to be important.\u2019 That\u2019s Chris Inglis.\u201d\n Inglis\u2019 supporters have described him as well-prepared to face his biggest challenges. While he will not control the military operations of U.S. Cyber Command or the spying activities of the NSA from his White House post, he is deeply familiar with how both organizations work, having helped oversee the launch of Cyber Command, which is run by the same official who heads the NSA.\n And while Inglis\u2019 military background created some controversy when his name first surfaced as a candidate for cyber director \u2014 a role that will now be his first civilian government assignment \u2014 his six and a half years as a partner at the private equity firm Paladin Capital Group offered him a front-row seat to the growing cyber threats facing U.S. businesses. That experience could serve him well as he seeks to streamline how the federal government helps the private sector combat hackers.\n With his mandate largely undefined, Inglis will have a unique opportunity to shape the role of the cyber director.

Of these, one of the most impressive was  Elasmotherium sibiricum.\n  Weighing up to 3.5 tonnes, it lived on the Eurasian grasslands ranging from southwestern Russia and Ukraine to Kazakhstan and Siberia.\n Eventually the species went extinct - but exactly when that happened has been in doubt.\n For those studying the fauna of the last Ice Age, one of the most significant events of the period was the megafaunal extinction. It saw the disappearance of many large, iconic species such as the woolly mammoth, the Irish elk and the sabre-toothed cat.\n Prof Adrian Lister, Merit Researcher at the Museum, says, &#39;This megafaunal extinction event didn&#39;t really get going until about 40,000 years ago. So  Elasmotherium with its apparent extinction date of 100,000 years ago has not been considered as part of that same event.&#39;\n Over the last few years, however, there have been some hints that this extinction date for  E. sibiricum might be wrong.\n &#39;We dated a few specimens - such as the beautiful complete skull we have at the Museum - and to our surprise they came in at less than 40,000 years old,&#39; explains Adrian.\n  On its own this did not mean much, but by teaming up with researchers from the Netherlands and Russia, many more fossils were sampled. The researchers, who originally had not a single radiocarbon-dated  Elasmotherium fossil, ended up with 23 dated specimens.\n &#39;They very strongly all confirmed that this species survived until at least 39,000 years ago, and maybe as late as 35,000 years ago,&#39; says Adrian. The results have been published in  Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution.\n  Elasmotherium sibiricum was a true Ice Age giant, weighing up to twice as much as a modern rhino.\n Unusually, despite its massive size and prominent shoulder hump, it is thought that the Siberian unicorn was actually adapted to running at speed.\n &#39;The rhino&#39;s anatomy suggested that it lived in pretty open, grassy plains, grazing almost entirely on grass,&#39; explains Adrian. &#39;Its unusual teeth look very strongly adapted for that kind of grazing as well.&#39;\n By studying the stable isotope ratios in the rhino&#39;s teeth, which involves looking at the levels of different carbon and nitrogen isotopes and then comparing them to different plants, the researchers were able determine what the animals were eating. The results confirm that the Siberian unicorn was most likely grazing on tough, dry grasses.\n  &#39;Modern rhinos tend to be rather solitary and spread out in their habitat,&#39; says Adrian. &#39;Combined with  Elasmotherium&#39;s restricted geographical range, it might have been quite a rare animal.&#39;\n  This natural scarcity may have been one of the factors that tipped the Siberian unicorn into extinction some 39,000 years ago, around the same time that  Neanderthals went extinct and some time before cave bears and spotted hyenas were last seen in Europe.\n This means that the animals would have been sharing Eurasia with both modern humans and Neanderthals, but as Adrian explains, it is unlikely that they were hunted into extinction.\n &#39;There is no evidence at all that people had anything to do with it. You can&#39;t rule it out, but we don&#39;t have any archaeological association of this animal with people in any way at any sites known so far,&#39; he says.\n Instead it is much more probable that their extinction was the result of the dramatic fluctuations in climate that were occurring during this time period, coupled with the specialised grazing lifestyle and low population numbers.\n &#39;The environment where the animal was living seems to have changed quite considerably around the same time it went extinct,&#39; explains Adrian, &#39;so it is quite plausible that if it were a rare animal to start with then it would have been at a relatively high risk of extinction.&#39;\n  Finally, Adrian&#39;s colleagues in Australia were able to extract DNA from some of the fossils, the first time any DNA has ever been recovered from  E. sibiricum.\n This has helped to settle a debate about where the Siberian unicorn, along with all other members of the  Elastrotherium genus, fit on the rhino evolutionary tree.\n It turns out that the ancient group split from the modern group of rhinos roughly 43 million years ago. This means that the Siberian unicorn was the last species of a highly distinctive and ancient linage when it went extinct on the Eurasian plains only a few tens of thousands of years ago.",

control laws \u2014 and prohibits state and local cooperation with enforcement of those laws.\n  Gov. Mike Parson signed  the bill, known as HB 85 or the Second Amendment Preservation Act,  into law Saturday at a gun store and shooting range called Frontier Justice.\n  The law declares federal laws and regulations &#34;that infringe on the people&#39;s right to keep and bear arms as guaranteed by the Second Amendment ... must be invalid in this state.&#34;\n  Parson, a Republican,  said in a press release that the legislation &#34;draws a line in the sand and demonstrates our commitment to reject any attempt by the federal government to circumvent the fundamental right Missourians have to keep and bear arms to protect themselves and their property.&#34;\n      &#34;They can pass a law that says that there are 46 planets, they can pass a law that says that there are 16 days in the week. It doesn&#39;t make it so,&#34; says  Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law and an expert on federal courts and constitutional law. &#34;It has no effect legally because the Constitution specifically says you can&#39;t do that.&#34;\n    &#34;If I am a resident of Missouri, I am no less subject to federal gun laws today than I was yesterday,&#34; Vladeck tells NPR.\n    The U.S. Constitution&#39;s  Supremacy Clause essentially says federal law is supreme over state law. And  the preemption doctrine means that &#34;valid federal law will always displace a state law, even a state constitutional provision that is inconsistent with that federal law,&#34; Vladeck says.\n  He notes that after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, some states passed laws that said the ACA wouldn&#39;t apply in those states. But that hasn&#39;t stopped the ACA from being the law of the land in every state.\n  So, what sort of federal gun laws are there? There are limits on what kinds of guns you can sell across state lines, and limits on what kind of guns and accessories can be sold in the first place. There are federal background check requirements. One provision  bans the possession of firearms by individuals convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. And there are laws governing the process and substance of gun sales, Vladeck says.\n  The new law doesn&#39;t change the liability of people in Missouri or exempt them from federal laws. So if you&#39;re a Missouri gun shop owner, you&#39;re still required to uphold federal background check requirements and other federal laws, even if the governor suggests otherwise.\n    Vladeck views Missouri&#39;s new law as symbolic public relations stunt. But he says it&#39;s symbolism that can be harmful: &#34;You run the risk that the state officials are actually sending a message to their constituents that is just incorrect, and that is exposing them to legal liability that they may not otherwise realize.&#34;\n  &#34;A Missouri gun store that thinks all of a sudden it can stop complying with federal law is going to receive a pretty unpleasant visit from federal authorities,&#34; Vladeck says.\n      While states can&#39;t invalidate federal law, they  can decide the extent to which they assist federal law enforcement.\n  &#34;Under the 10th Amendment, states do have the right to withhold the use of their resources to enforce federal laws,&#34; says  Allison Anderman, senior counsel at Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n  &#34;We&#39;re just simply saying we&#39;re not going to lift a finger to enforce their rules,&#34; Missouri state Sen. Eric Burlison, a Republican, said of the bill last month,  according to  The Kansas City (Mo.) Star.\n  In addition to claiming to invalidate federal gun laws, Missouri&#39;s new law prohibits state and local cooperation with enforcement of those laws. Agencies whose officers knowingly enforce federal gun laws could be hit with fines of $50,000 for each violating officer.\n  State and local officers are not usually tasked with going out and enforcing federal law, Vladeck says \u2013 usually it happens in an ancillary fashion: &#34;If they&#39;re conducting a search of a home because of probable cause of a state crime, they might also find evidence of a federal crime that they&#39;ll refer to federal authorities.&#34;\n  Whether local law enforcement in Missouri will do that when it comes to guns is now in question.\n  The Department of Justice sent a letter on Wednesday night to Parson and Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, warning that the state&#39;s law could damage the working relationship between local and federal authorities, The Associated Press  reported. Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton asked Parson and Schmitt to clarify the law and how it would work by Friday.\n  A spokesperson for the Justice Department confirmed the accuracy of the AP&#39;s report. NPR has not viewed the letter.\n  NPR asked the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives whether the statute would have an impact on its enforcement in the state, but an ATF spokesperson said the agency does not comment on local or state firearms law.\n    Missouri has one of the country&#39;s  highest rates of gun deaths per capita, and  weak gun control laws.\n  The law could have a chilling effect on law enforcement officers&#39; actions when it comes to guns, even if its provisions are unconstitutional and confusing, Anderman says.\n  &#34;There is a tremendous amount of ambiguity in this bill as to what would constitute a violation, and that may inhibit law enforcement from taking action that is needed to protect the community,&#34; she tells NPR.\n  Say an officer encounters someone who has a felony conviction and is in possession of a firearm?\n  &#34;They may not refer that case to federal law enforcement out of fear that they would be liable for a $50,000 fine. And that in turn can result in lack of prosecution of a law that is intended to keep guns out of the hands of people who have committed society&#39;s most serious crimes,&#34; Anderman says.\n  The state is not alone in considering this kind of legislation. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson  said in April he would sign a similar bill approved by the Legislature there.\n  Other states are considering legislation to nullify federal gun laws. But Missouri&#39;s law, Anderman says, will have real-life consequences \u2014 whether or not any law enforcement officers are actually prosecuted and fined.\n  &#34;How many officers have failed to take some action that they might have otherwise taken because of this law? We will likely never know the answer,&#34; she says, &#34;but it&#39;s the deterrent effect that is so concerning.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-18 11:07:14", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

Authority is headquartered in Kingston, Jamaica, in a building that looks a bit like a prison and a bit like a Holiday Inn. The I.S.A., which has been described as \u201cchronically overlooked\u201d and is so obscure that even many Jamaicans don\u2019t know it exists, has jurisdiction over roughly half the globe.\n Under international law, countries control the waters within two hundred miles of their shores. Beyond that, the oceans and all they contain are considered \u201cthe common heritage of mankind.\u201d This realm, which encompasses nearly a hundred million square miles of seafloor, is referred to in I.S.A.-speak simply as the Area.\n  Scattered across the Area are great riches. Mostly, these take the shape of lumps that resemble blackened potatoes. The lumps, known formally as polymetallic nodules, consist of layers of ore that have built up around bits of marine debris, such as ancient shark teeth. The process by which the metals accumulate is not entirely understood; however, it\u2019s thought to be exceedingly slow. A single spud-size nugget might take some three million years to form. It has been estimated that, collectively, the nodules on the bottom of the ocean contain six times as much cobalt, three times as much nickel, and four times as much of the rare-earth metal yttrium as there is on land. They contain six thousand times as much tellurium, a metal that\u2019s even rarer than the rare earths.\n The first attempts to harvest this submerged wealth were undertaken nearly fifty years ago. In the summer of 1974, a drillship purportedly belonging to Howard Hughes\u2014the Hughes Glomar Explorer\u2014anchored north of Midway Atoll, ostensibly to bring up nodules from the depths. In fact, the ship was operated by the C.I.A., which was trying to raise a sunken Soviet submarine. But then, in a curious twist, a real company called Ocean Minerals leased the Glomar to collect nodules from the seabed west of Baja California. The president of the company likened the exercise to \u201cstanding on the top of the Empire State Building, trying to pick up small stones on the sidewalk using a long straw, at night.\u201d\n After the Glomar expeditions, interest in seabed mining waned. It\u2019s now waxing again. As one recent report put it, \u201cThe Pacific Ocean is the scene of a new wild west.\u201d Thirty companies have received permits from the I.S.A. to explore the Area. Most are looking to slurp up the nodules; others are hoping to excavate stretches of the ocean floor that are rich in cobalt and copper. Permits to begin commercial mining could be issued within a few years.\n Proponents of deep-sea mining argue that the sooner it starts the better. Manufacturing wind turbines, electric vehicles, solar panels, and batteries for energy storage requires resources, often scarce ones. (Tellurium is a key component in thin-film solar panels.) \u201cThe reality is that the clean-energy transition is not possible without taking billions of tons of metal from the planet,\u201d Gerard Barron, the chairman of the\u00a0Metals Company, one of the businesses that holds permits from the I.S.A., observed a few months ago. Seafloor nodules, he said, \u201coffer a way to dramatically reduce\u201d the environmental impact of extracting these tons.\n  But seabed mining poses environmental hazards of its own. The more scientists learn about the depths, the more extraordinary the discoveries. The ocean floor is populated by creatures that thrive under conditions that seem impossibly extreme. There is, for example, a ghostly pale deep-sea octopus that lays its eggs only on the stalks of nodule-dwelling sponges. Remove the nodules in order to melt them down and it will, presumably, take millions of years for new ones to form.\n Edith Widder is a marine biologist, a MacArthur Fellow, and the author of \u201c Below the Edge of Darkness: A Memoir of Exploring Light and Life in the Deep Sea\u201d (Random House). Widder is an expert on bioluminescence, a topic that she became interested in after nearly going blind. In 1970, when she was a freshman in college, she had to have surgery for a broken back. The surgery went fine, but afterward she started hemorrhaging. Her heart stopped beating, and she was resuscitated. This happened again, and then a third time. Blood leaked into both of her eyes, blocking her retinas. \u201cMy visual world was swirling darkness with occasional glimpses of meaningless light,\u201d she recalls. Eventually, she regained her vision, but she no longer took sight for granted.\n \u201cWe believe we see the world as it is,\u201d she writes. \u201cWe don\u2019t. We see the world as we need to see it to make our existence possible.\u201d\n The same goes for fish. Only the\u00a0top layers of the oceans are illuminated. The \u201csunlight zone\u201d extends down about seven hundred feet, the \u201ctwilight zone\u201d down another twenty-six hundred feet. Below that\u2014in the \u201cmidnight zone,\u201d\u00a0the \u201cabyssal zone,\u201d and the \u201chadal zone\u201d\u2014there\u2019s only blackness, and the light created by life itself. In this vast darkness, so many species have mastered the art of bioluminescence that Widder estimates they constitute a \u201cmajority of the creatures on the planet.\u201d The first time she descended into the deep in an armored diving suit called a  , she was overwhelmed by the display. \u201cThis was a light extravaganza unlike anything I could have imagined,\u201d she writes. \u201cAfterwards, when asked to describe what I had seen, I blurted, \u2018It\u2019s like the Fourth of July down there!\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n  Bioluminescent creatures produce light via chemical reaction. They synthesize luciferins, compounds that, in the presence of certain enzymes, known as luciferases, oxidize and give off photons. The trick is useful enough that\u00a0bioluminescence has evolved independently some fifty times. Eyes, too, have evolved independently about fifty times, in creatures as diverse as flies, flatworms, and frogs. But, Widder points out, \u201cthere is one remarkable distinction.\u201d All animals\u2019 eyes employ the same basic strategy to convert light to sensation, using proteins called opsins. In the case of\u00a0bioluminescence, different groups of organisms produce very different luciferins, meaning that each has invented its own way to shine.\n The most obvious reason to flash a light in the dark is to find food. Some animals, like the stoplight loosejaw, a fish with photon-emitting organs under each eye, use bioluminescence to seek out prey. Others, like the humpback blackdevil, hope to attract victims with their displays; the blackdevil sports a shiny lure that dangles off its forehead like a crystal from a chandelier.\n Bioluminescence also serves less straightforward functions. It can be used to entice mates and to startle enemies. The giant red mysid, a hamster-size crustacean, spews streams of blue sparkles from nozzles near its mouth; these, it\u2019s believed, distract would-be attackers. Some animals smear their pursuers with bioluminescent slime\u2014the marks make them targets for other predators\u2014and some use bioluminescence as camouflage. This last strategy is known as counterillumination, and it\u2019s used in the twilight zone, where many creatures have upward-looking eyes that scan for the silhouettes of prey. The prey can adjust their glow to blend in with the light filtering down from above.\n Since it\u2019s so hard for humans to get to  the deep sea\u2014and, once there, to record what they\u2019re seeing\u2014Widder has spent much of her career trying to figure out ways to study bioluminescence remotely. She\u2019s developed special deep-sea cameras that rely on red light, which marine creatures mostly can\u2019t detect. Much of \u201cBelow the Edge of Darkness\u201d is occupied with the travails of getting these cameras placed, a project that involves journeys so nauseating that Widder describes cycling through the five stages of seasickness. In the fourth, she explains, \u201cyou\u2019re afraid you\u2019re going to die,\u201d and in the last \u201cyou\u2019re\u00a0afraid you\u2019re not.\u201d\n  The experience that she really wants to convey, though, is not queasiness but wonder. The creatures of the deep have been putting on the world\u2019s greatest\u00a0light show for tens of millions of years. Widder thinks that if people could witness this spectacle\u2014or even just be made aware of it\u2014they\u2019d pay a lot more attention to life at the bottom of the seas and the many hazards that threaten it. These include but are not limited to global\u00a0warming, ocean acidification, overfishing, agricultural runoff, oil spills, invasive species, bottom trawling, plastic waste, and seabed mining.\n  \u201cWe seem to be in a Catch-22 scenario where we haven\u2019t explored the deep ocean because we don\u2019t appreciate what a remarkable, mysterious, and wondrous place it is, and we don\u2019t know what an astonishing place it is because we haven\u2019t explored it,\u201d she argues. Meanwhile, she writes, \u201cwe are managing to destroy the ocean before we even know what\u2019s in it.\u201d\n All marine photosynthesis takes place in the sunlight zone. Beneath that, food is in such short supply that the occasional dead whale that falls to the ocean floor represents a major source of nutrients. Nevertheless, even in the farthest recesses of the oceans, life finds a way.\n The Mariana snailfish, as its name suggests, occupies the Mariana Trench\u2014the ocean\u2019s deepest depression\u2014in the western Pacific. It\u2019s a few inches long\u00a0and looks like a large, pale-pink tadpole. The Mariana snailfish has been found more than twenty-six thousand feet below sea level, where the pressure is eight hundred times greater than at the surface. To survive under such conditions, the snailfish has come up with various ingenious adaptations: its skull is not completely closed, its bones are unusually rubbery, and it produces special chemicals to prevent its proteins from denaturing under stress. The creature can barely see and instead relies on fluid-filled chambers along its jaws, which detect the movements of small crustaceans known as amphipods. Amphipods, for their part, have been collected from the very bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost thirty-six thousand feet down, where the pressure is so great that the animals\u2019 shells, in theory at least, should dissolve. A team of Japanese scientists recently reported that one deep-dwelling amphipod,  Hirondellea gigas, protects its shell by coating it in an aluminum-based gel, produced from metal that it extracts from seafloor mud.\n  Some of the seas\u2019 most extraordinary animals live around hydrothermal vents\u2014the oceanic equivalents of hot springs. Through cracks in the seafloor, water comes in contact with the earth\u2019s magma; the process leaves it superheated and loaded with dissolved minerals. (At some vents, the water reaches a temperature of more than seven hundred degrees.) As the water rises and cools, the minerals precipitate out to form crenellated, castlelike structures. Hydrothermal vents had been theorized about for many years but remained unseen until 1977, when a team of geologists and geochemists travelling on a research vessel called the Knorr located one about two hundred and fifty miles northeast of the Gal\u00e1pagos. A pair of scientists went down to take a look at it in a submersible named Alvin.\n \u201cIsn\u2019t the deep ocean supposed to be like a desert?\u201d one of them asked over Alvin\u2019s phone link.\n   As Helen Scales, a British marine biologist, explains in her new book, \u201c The Brilliant Abyss: Exploring the Majestic Hidden Life of the Deep Ocean, and the Looming Threat That Imperils It\u201d (Grove Atlantic), \u201cthese animals\u201d turned out to be fundamentally different from other creatures. At the bottom of the vents\u2019 food chains are microbes that have come up with their own novel survival strategy. Instead of using photosynthesis, which harnesses the energy of photons, they rely on chemosynthesis, which uses the energy stored in chemical bonds. Since the late nineteen-seventies, Scales reports, researchers have catalogued hundreds of strange species living around vents; they include creatures so puzzling that it\u2019s hard to find a limb for them on the tree of life.\n Yeti crabs, first observed in 2005 on a vent system along the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, south of Easter Island, look like hairy white lobsters. Their \u201chairs\u201d are actually extensions of their shells, and along them live colonies of chemosynthetic bacteria, which the crabs scrape up and consume. Yeti crabs were found to be so evolutionarily distinctive that taxonomists had to create not just a new genus but a whole new family for them.\n Xenoturbella profunda is a creature that looks like a discarded tube sock. First collected from a vent system in the Gulf of California in 2015, it has no intestines or central nervous system, and scientists aren\u2019t even sure what phylum it belongs to.  Chrysomallon squamiferum, commonly referred to as the scaly-foot snail, is a mollusk that\u2019s been found at vents in the Indian Ocean, at a depth of ten thousand feet. It\u2019s the only animal known to build its shell with iron, and around its foot it sports a fringe of iron plates that looks a bit like a flamenco skirt. The snail carries around chemosynthesizing microbes in a special pouch in its throat. In 2019,  Chrysomallon squamiferum became the first vent-dwelling creature to be included on the Red List of Threatened Species, maintained by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The rationale for the listing is that the species has been found at only three sites, and two of these are being explored for mining. Its living space, the I.U.C.N. has observed, is thus apt to be \u201cseverely reduced or destroyed.\u201d\n Scales, like Widder, worries that the bottom of the ocean will be wrecked before many of the most marvellous creatures living there are even identified. \u201cThe frontier story has always been one of destruction and loss,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt is na\u00efve to assume that the process would play out any differently in the deep.\u201d Indeed, she argues, the depths are particularly ill-suited to disturbance because, owing to a scarcity of food, creatures tend to grow and reproduce extremely slowly. \u201cVital habitat is created by corals and sponges that live for millennia,\u201d she writes.\n If deep-sea mining proceeds, it\u2019s likely that one of the first countries to pursue it will be Nauru, a tiny nation that, as it happens, was itself almost destroyed by mining.\n About the size of Block Island, Nauru sits in the South Pacific, about sixteen hundred miles northeast of Papua New Guinea. For thousands of years, the island\u2019s largest visitors were birds, which used it, in the words of one journalist, as a \u201cglorified rest stop.\u201d Polynesians and Micronesians arrived on the island sometime around 1000 B.C. They seem to have lived harmoniously\u2014even idyllically\u2014until gun-toting Europeans showed up, in the early nineteenth century. At the start of the twentieth century, a New Zealander named Albert Ellis realized that the ancient bird droppings that coated the island were a rich source of phosphate, an important fertilizer. During the next six decades, more than thirty-five million tons of phosphate were dug out of Nauru and shipped off to farms in Europe and Australia. The process stripped much of the island bare, leaving nothing but jagged pillars of limestone sticking out of the ground. A  National Geographic photographer who visited Nauru mid-destruction wrote, \u201cA worked-out phosphate field is a dismal, ghastly tract.\u201d\n  In 1968, Nauru became its own country. The phosphate business was still booming, and, on paper, the island\u2019s ten thousand residents became some of the richest people in the world. The new nation used its sovereign wealth to invest in, among other things, cruise ships, airplanes, overseas office buildings, and a London musical based on the life of Leonardo da Vinci. The musical flopped, as did most of the other ventures. Nauruans \u201chave a long history of being taken to the cleaners by crooks\u201d is how Helen Hughes, an Australian economist, put it. In 2001, in return for various fees and payments, Nauru\u2019s government allowed Australia to set up a detention center for refugees on the island. The center soon became infamous for its grim conditions.\n  Today, with the phosphate mostly mined out and the refugees mostly resettled, Nauru is betting on nodules. To engage in deep-sea exploration and mining, a company must be sponsored by a country that\u2019s party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. (The U.S. is one of the few nations that has not ratified the Law of the Sea treaty, because of conservative opposition in the Senate.) Nauru has teamed up with the Metals Company, which is based in Canada, to explore a region of the Pacific known as the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, west of Mexico. \u201cWe are proud that Pacific nations have been leaders in the deep-sea minerals industry,\u201d a statement co-authored by Nauru\u2019s representative to the International Seabed Authority recently declared. The deal, it\u2019s estimated, could eventually bring the country more than a hundred million dollars a year. Alternatively, the arrangement could prove even more disastrous than the da Vinci musical. At one point, Nauru officials expressed concern to the I.S.A. that, if a sponsoring nation were held liable for damages arising from a mining operation, it could \u201cface losing more than it actually has.\u201d\n The I.S.A., for its part, has been assigned the task not just of issuing the permits for seabed mining but also of drafting the regulations to govern the practice. These regulations have yet to be finalized, so it\u2019s unclear how stringent they will be. (The final rules are supposed to be in place before commercial mining commences, though the Metals Company has threatened to try to start without them.) Many marine scientists argue that because deep-sea ecosystems are so fragile\u2014and operations that are miles below the surface so difficult to monitor\u2014the only safe way to proceed is not to. Scales makes this point, but acknowledges that the I.S.A. is unlikely to be swayed. She quotes Daniel Jones, a researcher at the British National Oceanography Centre, who says, \u201cEven if we found unicorns living on the seafloor, I don\u2019t think that would necessarily stop mining.\u201d Meanwhile, assuming that mining does go forward, it\u2019s been suggested that faux nodules could be manufactured and dropped by ship into the deep ocean, to replace those being refashioned into batteries. The perfect vessel for this task would have been the Glomar; unfortunately, a few years ago it was sold for scrap.\u00a0\u2666\n    Sign up for our daily  newsletter to receive the best stories from  The New Yorker.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 11:06:46", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4ee3\u4ef7,sea,\u6d77\u6d0b", "title": "\u6df1\u6d77\u5145\u6ee1\u4e86\u5b9d\u85cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4ee5\u4ee3\u4ef7\u4e3a\u6b62 ", "title_en": "The Deep Sea Is Filled with Treasure, but It Comes at a Price", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/06/21/the-deep-sea-is-filled-with-treasure-but-it-comes-at-a-price", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4ee3\u4ef7", "sea", "\u6d77\u6d0b"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "19f86dc46c81190c889c0518b49a1388.jpg", "infoid": 1066636, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u897f\u96c5\u56fe\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5927\u9ebb\u5e02\u573a\u53f6\u5b50\u5df2\u5173\u95ed\u65b0\u8d44\u91d12300\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u800cGeekwire\u4e0e\u516c\u53f8\u786e\u8ba4\u3002\u968f\u7740\u5927\u9ebb\u5e02\u573a\u5728\u5927\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u5927\u9ebb\u5e02\u573a\u770b\u5230\u9500\u552e\u5e02\u573a\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9500\u552e\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u9500\u552e\u989d\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u65b0\u9c9c\u7684\u73b0\u91d1\u8f93\u6db2\u5c31\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u3002\n \u542f\u52a8\u8ba1\u5212\u6269\u5c55\u5176\u5728\u7ebf\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u8ba9\u5ba2\u6237\u548c\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u8d2d\u4e70\u548c\u9500\u552e\u5927\u9ebb\u3002\u53f6\u5b50\u4e5f\u7528\u4f5c\u6559\u80b2\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u67091.2\u4ebf\u4eba\u6e38\u5ba2\u3002\n \u8d44\u91d1\u5c06\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u5165\u516c\u53f8\u7684160\u4eba\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u51e0\u5e74\u4e2d\u9075\u5faa\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u88c1\u5458\u3002\n   2020\u5e741\u6708\uff0c\u53f6\u5b50\u524a\u51cf\u4e8618\uff05\u7684\u5458\u5de5\uff0c\u621654\u4e2a\u804c\u4f4d\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dCeo-Ceo\u8482\u6885\u5229\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u201c\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5927\u9ebb\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u73b0\u5b9e\u201d\u3002\u4e24\u4e2a\u6708\u540e\uff0c\u5b83\u524a\u51cf\u4e8691\u540d\u5458\u5de5\uff0c\u6293\u4f4f\u4e86\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\n \u53f6\u5b50\u76ee\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98Yoko Miyashita\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u5bb6\u524d\u76d6\u8482\u56fe\u7247Exec\uff0c\u66fe\u57282019\u5e74\u52a0\u5165\u540e\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u5f8b\u5e08\u3002\n \u83b1\u65af\u5229\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u524d\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u7684\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u4e0d\u5230\u4e24\u5e74\u7684\u524d\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900aexec\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53eb\u505a\u751f\u6839\u7684\u519c\u4e1a\u975e\u8425\u5229\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u3002\n   \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6536\u5165\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u5927\u9ebb\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u652f\u4ed8\u7684\u6bcf\u6708\u8ba2\u9605\u8d39\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5e02\u5e76\u8bbf\u95ee\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u5b83\u8fd8\u4ece\u5e7f\u544a\u4e2d\u8d5a\u94b1\u3002 \n\u6839\u636e\u5927\u9ebb\u56fd\u5bb6\u7a0e\u6536\u548c\u6536\u5165\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u53f6\u5b50\u7684\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5927\u9ebb\u884c\u4e1a\u57282020\u5e74\u9500\u552e\u989d\u589e\u52a0\u4e8671\uff05\u3002\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u53bb\u5e74\u82b1\u4e86\u5927\u9ebb\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u7ea6183\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n \u53f6\u8302\u76db\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5927\u9ebb\u5408\u6cd5\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u6b63\u5728\u52a0\u901f\u5927\u9ebb\u5e02\u573a\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5c06\u5229\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u8d44\u91d1\u6765\u71c3\u6599\u8425\u9500\u5728\u4e1c\u6d77\u5cb8\uff0c\u51e0\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u6700\u8fd1\u5df2\u7ecf\u5408\u6cd5\u5316\u4e86\u5927\u9ebb\u3002\n \u5a31\u4e50\u5927\u9ebb\u4e3a16\u4e2a\u5dde\u548c\u54e5\u4f26\u6bd4\u4e9a\u5730\u533a\u7684\u6210\u5e74\u4eba\u5408\u6cd5\u3002 Medical Marijuana\u5728\u989d\u5916\u768420\u6b21\u989d\u5916\u662f\u5408\u6cd5\u7684\u3002\u636eInsider\u79f0\uff0c\u4eca\u5e743\u670831\u65e5\u7684\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5dde\u5408\u6cd5\u5316\u9505\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5f17\u5409\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5dde\u548c\u65b0\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u5dde\u7684\u65b0\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u5747\u53d1\u6325\u7740\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u7acb\u6cd5\u3002\n  \u5176\u4ed6\u516c\u53f8\u6b63\u5728\u56de\u5e94\u6f6e\u6d41 -

The fresh cash infusion comes as the cannabis market sees an increase in sales as more states legalize pot and dispensaries were declared essential businesses during the pandemic.\n The startup plans to expand its online marketplace that lets customers and retailers buy and sell cannabis. Leafly also serves as  an educational resource. The platform has 120 million annual visitors.\n The funding will be used to add to the company\u2019s 160-person workforce and follows a series of layoffs over the past few years.\n   In January 2020, Leafly   cut 18%  of its staff, or 54 positions, which then-CEO  Tim Leslie attributed to \u201cmarket realities of the technology and cannabis sectors.\u201d It   cut 91 more employees two months later , citing the uncertainties caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\n Leafly is currently under the leadership of CEO  Yoko Miyashita, a former Getty Images exec who was previously the company\u2019s   general counsel after joining in 2019 .\n Leslie, a former Amazon exec who was Leafly\u2019s CEO for less than two years, is now a founder of a farming nonprofit called Living Roots.\n   The company\u2019s  revenue primarily comes from a monthly subscription fee paid by cannabis retailers to be listed on the platform and to access e-commerce tools. It also makes money from advertising.\n The cannabis industry saw a 71% increase in sales in 2020, according to   Leafly\u2019s report  based on marijuana state tax and revenue records. Americans spent about $18.3 billion on cannabis products last year.\n Leafly said marijuana legalization trends are accelerating the cannabis market. The company will use the new funding to fuel marketing on the east coast, where several states have legalized marijuana recently.\n Recreational marijuana is legal for adults in 16 states and the District of Columbia. Medical marijuana is legal in an additional 20 more. Some of these changes were made this year, with New York legalizing pot on March 31, and both Virginia and New Mexico passing similar legislation, which will take effect this summer, according to   Insider .\n  Other companies are responding to the trend \u2014 tech-giant Amazon just announced it would   stop screening certain job applicants for drug use , and it   backed federal legislation  that would legalize and decriminalize pot.\n Investors are also getting on the cannabis boom.  Dutchie , an Oregon-based cannabis e-commerce platform,   announced $200 million in new funding  in March. The company was valued at $1.7 billion.\n  Leafly has raised $38 million in total funding. The recent round was led primarily by existing investors, but Leafly didn\u2019t disclose specific firms or individuals.\n  That means seed stage investing \u2014 an average of 30% of their initial investments are in seed stage companies.\n What goes into the process of securing seed funding?

Along with Ancestry, it has helped pioneer the idea that genetic testing is not just a medical field, but a big consumer business. Its at-home testing kits, which allowed people to learn about their genetic profiles and ancestry by sending a bit of saliva through the mail, ushered in a new era of personalized medicine, though not without controversy.\n 23andMe, a five-time  CNBC Disruptor 50 company, has not had a straight or sure path to success as a public company.\n It faced FDA scrutiny earlier in its history; continues to face questions about consumer privacy as it gathers genetic information on millions of individuals; ran into financial challenges in recent years as the market for personalized genetic tests seemed to get saturated; skepticism over the basis for its gene-based risk analysis remains contentious; and as it dives deeper into drug development, a gap in its current customer base and underlying genetic data between a majority European genetic profile and underrepresentation of many minority and ethnic groups.\n &#34;It will take time ... really making sure we are getting all communities to participate in research,&#34; Wojcicki said in an interview with CNBC&#39;s &#34;TechCheck&#34; on Thursday morning. &#34;You can&#39;t make discoveries in a population if you don&#39;t have those people participating. We need the right customers and to represent the product back to them in the right way.&#34;\n  Wojcicki says the company sees big things ahead for both its consumer and drug research &amp; development platforms. Roughly 80% of 23andMe&#39;s now-11 million members opt into sharing their genetic information (de-identified) for research in drug development.\n &#34;Our genetics represent all of life on this planet, and we have the opportunity to understand what it means and with that, it will improve your own life but also contribute to all kinds of research discoveries,&#34; Wojcicki said.\n She says the controversy over the medical utility of the information when put in the hands of consumers won&#39;t go away, and it ranges on a spectrum from critical, clinical information, such as mutations in the gene that causes breast cancer, BRCA, to &#34;more controversial&#34; genetic information on Alzheimer&#39;s Disease variants. Some individuals with higher risk of blood clots make the decision to walk around more during plane flights as a result of their 23andMe reports.\n But she added that consumers have shown they want this information to help them make decisions.\n She said in the case of Alzheimer&#39;s risk, &#34;This information ... really influences how they live their life ... how they plan to retire ... plan to be older.&#34;\n Her own 10-year-old son used the company&#39;s lactose intolerance analysis to diagnose his stomach aches and Wojcicki herself, while reticent to discuss her personal use of the product, did say as the daughter of a woman who suffered from breast cancer and who has a higher risk of the disease, the information does influence her decision on having that &#34;recreational glass of wine.&#34;\n &#34;The last 15 years was putting together the infrastructure for how we can take off, proving to consumers we can get the information and proving they can understand it without a medical professional,&#34; she said.\n She says the key to its future is that consumers want to use the information to not only change their life but contribute to drug discovery.\n  &#34;We want them to truly have a personalized health-care experience and ... benefit the human genome from seeing all of this aggregated data turned into therapeutic programs,&#34; Wojcicki said. &#34;When I think about the future of therapeutics, in the next five years it is really about moving these programs forward and getting them into the clinic.&#34;\n The company also recently launched a subscription product to introduce more content and services for consumers who want to take additional steps after their genetic reports.\n &#34;We get thousands of people who call every week to the customer care team who would like to know how to use this information and apply it to live a healthier longer life,&#34; she said.\n The IPO market has already set an  annual record for deal volume in 2021, at $171 billion, and only halfway through the year. Average first day trade gains in deals this year have been above 40%. Though both traditional IPO market and SPAC returns have cooled off in recent months, with the Renaissance IPO ETF and the CNBC SPAC Index negative year-to-date after starting 2021 with a continuation of last year&#39;s big gains. Meanwhile,  concerns about SPAC deals have mounted and some high-profile SPACs like Branson&#39;s Virgin Galactic and electric vehicle maker Lordstown Motors have shown high levels of volatility.\n Nevertheless, Branson and other investors are  planning to bring another space business public, satellite internet service Virgin Orbit, via a SPAC in the weeks ahead.\n This story has been updated for the company&#39;s closing price in its first day of trading on Thursday.\n SIGN UP\u00a0 for our weekly, original newsletter that goes beyond the list, offering a closer look at CNBC Disruptor 50

", "note_en": "I\u2019ve written before about my time at  Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in the late 1990s, working on  a disastrous incentive program to build Alpha workstations. This one is another tale of Digital, but for it we need to go back a decade earlier. Back to 1986 when I joined the company, fresh out of college.\n I grew up in the late 70s/early 80s, idolizing DEC. It was the cool computer tech company that had produced the  PDP-8 mini, which I learned to program on, and later the  VAX 11/780, which I had used in some of my earliest computer courses I took while still in high school. Thinking they were the best computer company may have been  primacy bias on my part, perhaps. But there was no debating that Digital was a dominant force in the market, holding the number two computer manufacturer spot, behind IBM, and a desirable place for a new engineer to work.\n But by the time I was a Senior in college, it was strangely not I that went looking for a job at DEC; it was DEC that found me. I had in fact \u201cuneven\u201d grades let\u2019s say, and I was really just searching to find a job of any sort, as graduation neared. As fate would have it though, a school alumni who worked at Digital came by, looking for a college hire. The professor who\u2019s lab I worked in recommended me, and the next thing you know, I was renting my first car, to drive out to Shrewsbury, Massachusetts for an interview.\n I was worried about having to explain some of my grades, but the subject, luckily, never came up. They asked a few digital logic questions which I could definitely handle, and they were very interested in my senior design project, a microprocessor-based LAN/router I had built that later won best project at the school that year. (Having that project to talk about was definitely a lifesaver and welcome distraction from explaining my calculus woes!)\n They made me an offer the next day, and there was absolutely no debate in my head about taking it. So I went to work at my dream company, and I still remember the feeling of walking into work on day one and seeing my office and name plate, with brand new  VAXcluster-connected  VT100 terminal of my own ready for me, and thinking  \u201cHoly shit, I\u2019m working for Digital!\u201d\n I got an apartment about a mile down the road from the plant, but on day one in ESD, I learned that my assigned project was actually going to be at the office in Littleton, Massachusetts, 25 miles to the north. DEC of the day was this giant, spreading organism with offices sprouting up on an almost weekly basis in one town or another in the western suburbs of Boston. Inter-office hopping was common, and DEC would pay mileage for people who had to travel, and even had a fleet of helicopters to shuttle people around.\n Our ESD division in Shrewsbury had the job of designing the memory systems (dynamic ram) for all of DEC\u2019s products. My group worked on the main memory systems for VAX mainframes, which at the time were very complex beasts with a lot of specialized hardware for controlling things like interleaving, error detection and correction, self-test diagnostics, and ram refresh handling.\n  Later as computers became smaller, a lot of this specialized memory hardware was either not needed, or incorporated into ICs, and memory systems for computers in general became a commodity. By the time of my adventures in the Alpha workstations group in the 90\u2019s, there would no longer be a centralized storage group at DEC, for memory design anyway, and this idea that hardware could become a commodity had stuck in my head and was pushing me to (eventually) move to a software career.\n 1986 was a different matter. Our ESD group then was busy working on many products across the company, including several very large and as it turns out, competing mainframe designs. I would drive up to Littleton every day to work on my assigned product, which was a new VAX mainframe code-named \u201cArgonaut\u201d. This was to be a third-generation offering from the Midrange Systems Business (MSB) division of DEC, which had previously designed and built the  VAX 8800 series.\n The target market for the MSB group was medium-sized businesses: bigger than a mom-and-pop shop with only a few employees, but not a giant multinational company. Able to afford maybe hundreds of thousands for a computer, but not millions. This was a huge, growing market, and a host of minicomputer companies were playing in it, like  Data General,  Apollo, and  Prime Computer. But the big concern on everyone\u2019s minds in the various hardware groups around DEC was almost always \u201cBig Blue\u201d \u2014 IBM.\n  I don\u2019t remember having a lot of discussions about our competition, but there was a de-facto attitude among the engineers I hung out with anyway that the other minicomputer companies, such as Data General and Apollo, were just copycat wannabes \u2014 never able to match Digitals accomplishments, and not really a threat. IBM though held a different place in the threat hierarchy for us. I would say they commanded a lot more respect, being the number one computer company, and historically a major force in the development of computer technology.\n That didn\u2019t mean we thought they were better than us though. IBM\u2019s image at DEC was one of a stuffy, slow, old-school company who\u2019s time had already come and gone. (Ironically, that was very close to being true for DEC at this point, and in fact IBM would outlive us.) IBM was business-focused, and in a seemingly over-formal, boring way. Their engineers all wore ties, we were told (not entirely true, even in 1986), where at DEC, you would be made fun of if you showed up to work first day wearing a tie, even if you were a manager.\n And so I worked in the company thinking IBM was both technically and culturally the enemy. But within the hardware groups that were building mainframe computers, IBM was also the target to be emulated, and hopefully surpassed. DEC was creating bigger and bigger systems, and the once rack-sized minicomputers of the PDP era had given way to larger, multi-cabinet setups, even within the midrange business unit that in theory was supposed to be making smaller, cheaper computers.\n I worked for over a year on Argonaut, designing memory controller chips that handled our double-bit error correction and self test pattern generation, and working on the ram array design. We had completed the chip designs and simulations, and were to the point where we were getting close to building hardware.\n It was a crazy, incredible time, and I had the good fortune to work with and learn from some very talented people there, including a few who went on to be chip design superstars.  Jim Keller and  Pete Bannon to name a couple, but if I am going to name drop, I would also need to say that I was a very junior engineer, on the periphery of things. So I rarely interacted directly with the CPU design team and did not know those guys personally too well.\n One day though I was sitting in a lab back in Shrewsbury doing going over our design specs with some techs there, and I got a call from the Littleton office. They said management had called a big meeting, and it was about the project and I needed to get back to the office right away. I got in my car and drove up immediately, but it was a short meeting and by the time I got up there, it was over. The takeaway from it was, Argonaut had been cancelled.\n I and safe to say a very large majority of people there were completely blind-sided by this, as cancellation had not been even a fleeting thought for us. We were laser-focused on completing our design, and getting it out into the battlefield against IBM. But technology problems had crept in, and the management and some of the senior technical staff there had been quietly trying to resolve a major obstacle that had cropped up with the I/O structure of the gate array chips we were using.\n For the technical, this was an issue of simultaneous switching, causing signal integrity problems. It was a big issue, the kind that would normally lead to a major project delay, and possibly some people being fired for making poor technical decisions (but honestly, at DEC we never fired anyone, we were really bad at it)\n It could have been fixed, eventually though. Cancellation should have been off the table for a project like this, since building a next-generation business mainframe was at the time, a mission-critical thing for us.\n The reason that cancellation of a year-or-more-long effort involving hundreds of engineers was feasible in the minds of DEC\u2019s upper management was this: they had another competing product under development in the company to go to.\n Fifteen miles to the south, in Marlborough, Massachusetts, sat a hulking fortress of a building that Digital called \u201cMRO1\u201d. MRO1 was a three-story concrete and glass structure, originally built in 1969 by RCA for use as factory space. It was later purchased by DEC for manufacturing use as well, but eventually converted to office space that was home to a major division of the company - High Performance Systems (HPS).\n The sprawling factory floor that had years previously built  DECSystem-20s was now a sea of cubicles for the HPS engineering staff, the sheer scale of which was beyond anything I had ever seen, or have seen since. The Argonaut engineers from the much-smaller MSB building in Littleton would fit in one corner of this giant office complex.\n  This was Digital\u2019s \u201cbig computer\u201d division, the group that was tasked with going after IBMs core business with very large, and very expensive mainframe computer designs. And if the MSB division in Littleton had IBM-envy, it was nothing compared with what was going on over in Marlborough. HPS was very much trying to be IBM, so much so that there had been a mini cultural shift from the DEC norm going on there, with managers wearing ties and a general higher level of formality of engineering processes.\n  After the cancellation of Argonaut, there was a week-long, drunken party at the house of one of the engineers, \u201cNancy\u201d, who had a place with a big back yard and an inground pool. The day they announced the news we were all in shock, and Nancy came to the rescue, inviting everyone over for an impromptu party \u2014 which was a badly needed distraction for all involved. I don\u2019t remember much of it, I think Jim Keller threw me into the pool at one point, (which may have counted as the most significant interaction we ever had.)\n  It was supposed to be a one day party, but as everyone soon found out, there was nothing to do at work. People would show up in the morning, and the management would give out stuff to read and research, like some things about MIPS architecture that we were looking into. But then everyone would just kind of leave, and we\u2019d end up at Nancy\u2019s house with suntan lotion, coolers and barbeque supplies, probably much to her dismay after two or three days.\n The party eventually ended, but things went on over the summer in the same way: you would show up to work, see if anything was going on, management would say \u201cstay tuned\u201d, and you would go home. It amazed me even then that a company would allow this to happen. There were no layoffs, no reassignments to different groups, they just let everything float for pretty much the summer. It must have cost a fortune, and I highly doubt anything would go down like this ever again in today\u2019s tech business world.\n My situation that summer was different though, owing to the fact that I was actually not part of the MSB division, but part of Electronic Storage Development. I was a centralized resource, who could be deployed on other projects easily. My managers were not about to let me have the summer off, since HPS was in the middle of their own giant mainframe project, code-named \u201cAquarius\u201d. I was reassigned to this project, which was also in the late stages of development.\n It was not an easy transition for me. Although organizationally, I worked for an outside group, I had been embedded in the MSB design team for over a year and had become quite loyal to our effort, and felt like part of the tribe. HPS to us was not a group we thought about much, but probably when we did, we lumped them into the \u201cIBM\u201d category of being a bloated, overly-formal, stuffy division.\n There was not much if any communication or technical exchange between the HPS and MSB design teams, even though we were working on very similar products. So I didn\u2019t know what, if any, transferrable knowledge I gained from working on Argonaut could be applied to working on Aquarius.\n Once I got to Marlborough, I found that the HPS engineers were much more prone to looking over their shoulders at what might be going on over at MSB, and did in fact consider the ever-larger machines coming out of that division to be a competing threat to their work. They were all quite happy Argonaut was cancelled, and the product management there expanded the Aquarius product line to include a lower-end variant, called \u201cAridus\u201d to fill in the gap left by the cancellation of our project. The whole Aquarius program had been envisioned as an \u201cIBM Killer\u201d, but its first (and spoiler, only) victim would be a product within the same company.\n And so it was very hard not to feel out of place, working in HPS \u2014 almost like I was an exchange student, or perhaps, captured prisoner. I remember listening to HPS people disparage the product group in MSB, and then ask me if the people there did the same kind of thing when talking about HPS. I was the rare guy who had been over enemy lines, and they would often ask about what things were like in MSB, as if we were talking about Russia or something. I kind of shrugged, because honestly we did not spend a lot of time in MSB thinking about them.\n Someone should have though, obviously. Today I find it ridiculous that a major corporation would allow huge groups to silo to this degree, to fail to communicate, cooperate, and share, and to allow them to build overlapping and competing products. To allow this kind of animosity to build between employees of the same company. We\u2019re talking about thousands of engineers involved here, between the two divisions. Seems like something that could have only happened in the crazy 1980\u2019s, but I am betting if enough people read this far, we will see comments to the contrary.\n This siloed competition phenomenon in fact happens a lot, and I have seen lesser versions of this play out at other, smaller companies I\u2019ve worked for. Sometimes it is just a matter of two groups colliding with each other and trying to do the same thing, or even two individuals. The common goal of beating the external competition gives way to an internal fight for control of something, fueled by lack of communication and sometimes, lack of trust.\n Maybe its too simplistic a take, but for me it all of it owes to a failure of management, somewhere in the end. Easy to say I know, and not always easily or effectively addressed, but in essence avoidable. DEC\u2019s version of this failure was just perhaps a bigger example of competitive siloing that is allowed to manifest at many companies, very often to negative effect.\n The Aquarius project for its part turned out to be a billion dollar disaster, and that doesn\u2019t even count however much money was spent on our cancelled Argonaut project. Released in 1989 as the  VAX 9000, only a few dozen were sold, despite the billion dollar development cost.\n  Much of this failure owes to technical missteps, to be clear. Aquarius was so-named because it was a water cooled system, a necessity due to the enormous power demands of the bipolar transistor, emitter-coupled logic (ECL) technology used in the system. This technology was in favor at the time due to its speed, but required exotic cooling and interconnect technology that required an army of mechanical and thermal engineers to design.\n It all would soon be eclipsed by superior CMOS chip technology, which offered good performance with much less power required. This in turn allowed chips to be scaled up in size, reducing chip counts and thus interconnect delays between chips, boosting the overall performance of the entire system.\n And to be fair - our cancelled Argonaut project also utilized ECL chip technology, so would have had similar drawbacks. In the end, the winner (within DEC anyway) in this competitive CPU design contest was neither the Littleton MSB group or the Marlborough HPS group, but what was coming out of our chip foundry in Hudson, Massachusetts. Fast VLSI CMOS processors, starting with the  microVAX chip sets but eventually leading to the high-performance Alpha chip, would soon dominate the company, eliminating CPU design groups in both MSB and HPS.\n Maybe if we had moved these mainframe projects to CMOS earlier, there would have been a way for both these projects to succeed in the marketplace, who knows. And the larger strategic issue of DEC being slow to follow the \u201csmaller, cheaper, better\u201d route that the industry pivoted to once CMOS technology matured is also a huge factor in our companies decline \u2014 and beyond the scope of this story.\n It could be that failure was just in the cards for us. When I think back on this time though, I keep returning to the idea that we would have been in a much better position somehow if these company divisions had worked together, rather than competed as rivals. (In writing this, the word \u201cdivisions\u201d in the first place seems very tell-tale.)\n Certainly the R&amp;D costs would have been lower, and maybe a cooperating set of R&amp;D groups could have come up with a better technical solution. Or if MSB had targeted a lower-end market segment with less overlap, perhaps their project would not have been cancelled, and at least on of the two projects would have succeeded in making a profit. Whatever the case, the whole combined thing had to have gone down as one of the most expensive blunders in computer development history.\n I remember in 1993, after it had become clear that Aquarius was a flop, attending an R&amp;D staff meeting in an auditorium in Digital\u2019s famous \u201cMill\u201d headquarters in Maynard, Massachusetts, where I was then working in the Alpha Workstations group. DEC\u2019s stock price had dropped, we were in the midst of a series of layoffs, and a discontented crowd had gathered to hear Jack Smith, Chief Operating Officer of the company, speak.\n Jack was not well liked by a lot of the engineering staff, and had in the past done things such as send out a memo complaining about how the parking lot at the Mill was only half full at 9AM, where in the old days it was always full. When he was not accusing people of shorting their work hours, he was green-lighting bad product decisions, like funding two largely overlapping projects that used soon-to-be-obsolete technology. I don\u2019t remember the content of the meeting, probably a pep talk of some sort, but I do remember the Q&amp;A that followed.\n A bold engineer stood up and said bluntly that the company had spent one billion dollars developing a computer that no one wanted, and that if we had instead invested in literally anything else, such as for instance McDonald\u2019s franchises, we would have made more money. Jack (who was obviously bad at reading a room, or otherwise he would not have scheduled a Q&amp;A in the first place) stood there numbly and only said:\n    Many other armchair analysists and MBA students have debated the causes of Digital\u2019s downfall, and there is probably no new ground left to cover here. And I don\u2019t know to what degree the unchecked redundancy and inter-division competition played in the failures of these mainframe projects, or of Digital in general. But do I know it certainly didn\u2019t help. For me, the memories of these projects remain as an cautionary reminder of what can happen when people in an organization fail to cooperate with each other.\n Shortly after the events of this story, Digital would close its iconic Maynard headquarters, along with many other offices in order to control costs.

How was it possible that plutocrats such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Warren Buffett could pay nothing in income taxes to the federal government? What sneaky sleights of pen, what subterfuge, what acts of turpitude could have led to this result?\n   The shock stems, in part, from a disturbing reality: Nowhere does ProPublica assert that these men cheated, lied, or did anything felonious to lower their tax burdens. The naked fact of the matter is that not a single one of the documented methods and practices that allowed these billionaires to so radically minimize their tax obligations was illegal.\n What\u2019s worse, these methods and practices\u2014things such as offsetting income with losses in unrelated businesses; structuring assets to grow rather than generate income, then borrowing against those growing assets for cash needs; and deducting interest payments and state taxes from taxable income\u2014are so downright mundane and commonly applied that most rich people don\u2019t see them as unethical. The more interesting question is not how the men in ProPublica\u2019s report were able to avoid paying much or anything in federal income taxes, but why. What motivates people with so much money to try to withhold every last bit of it from the public\u2019s reach?\n  One factor is the common ideology that underlies all of these practices: The government is bad and cannot be trusted with money. Far better for the wealthy to keep as much of it as possible for themselves and use (a fraction of) it to do benevolent things through philanthropy.\n   My grandfather Roy O. Disney, who co-founded the Walt Disney Company with his brother Walt, was a fervent believer in this idea. He was so determined to prevent the government from taking any of the money he wanted to leave to his family that he created generation-skipping trusts to end-run the IRS. What he did back then was so effective that most of it is illegal today.\n I will protest to my dying breath that he was a good man\u2014one of the best, in fact.\n But I will also add, at the very end of that dying breath, that he should not have been able to do that.\n Practically speaking, the way the trusts were devised meant that I came into a significant amount of money at the tender age of 21. I became an asset manager before a lot of people get their first apartment. I\u2019m 61 now, meaning I\u2019ve been the recipient of four decades\u2019 worth of tax advice from the decent, good, kind men (yes, they were all men) who were put in place by my grandparents, and then my parents, to ensure that I wouldn\u2019t do anything stupid with what I had been given.\n  Every single method and practice outlined in the ProPublica report has been suggested to me at one time or another by these decent men as a credible, perfectly legal, and not-at-all-questionable way to manage my assets. And, over the years, I have said yes to many of those suggestions. So it\u2019s true: If you were to get a hold of my tax returns, you would find a record of a person who has adhered scrupulously to the law and, in doing so, has also taken advantage of the many holes our legal system has left wide open.\n When you come into money as I did\u2014young, scared, and not very savvy about the world\u2014you are taught certain precepts as though they are gospel: Never spend the \u201ccorpus\u201d (also known as the capital) you were left. Steward your assets to leave even more to your children, and then teach them to do the same. And finally, use every tool at your disposal within the law, especially through estate planning, to keep as much of that money as possible out of the hands of government bureaucrats who will only misuse it.\n  If you are raised in a deeply conservative family like my own, you are taught some extra bits of doctrine: Philanthropy is good, but too much of it is unseemly and performative. Marry people \u201cof your own class\u201d to save yourself from the complexity and conflict that come with a broad gulf in income, assets, and, therefore, power. And, as one of my uncles said to me during the Reagan administration, it\u2019s best to leave the important decision making to people who are \u201csuccessful,\u201d rather than in the pitiable hands of those who aren&#39;t.\n  I took far too long to look with clarity upon these precepts and see them for what they are: blueprints for dynastic wealth. Why it took me so long is a fair question. All I know is that if you are a fish, it is hard to describe water, much less to ask if water is necessary, ethical, and structured the way it ought to be. As long as no one so much as raised an eyebrow about the ethics of  the CRAT,  the CRUT, and the credit swap, who did I think I was to query the fundamentals? I did not have the emotional courage to go down that path.\n  There was another reason for my inaction, and I am deeply ashamed to say what it was. But here goes: Having money\u2014a lot of money\u2014is very, very nice. It\u2019s damn hard to resist the seductions of what money buys you. I\u2019ve never been much of a materialist, but I have wallowed in the less concrete privileges that come with a trust fund, such as time, control, security, attention, power, and choice. The fact is, this is pretty standard software that comes with the hardware of a human body.\n As time has passed, I have realized that the dynamics of wealth are similar to the dynamics of addiction. The more you have, the more you need. Whereas once a single beer was enough to achieve a feeling of calm, now you find that you can\u2019t stop at six. Likewise, if you move up from coach to business to first class, you won\u2019t want to go back to coach. And once you\u2019ve flown private, wild horses will never drag you through a public airport terminal again.\n  Comforts, once gained, become necessities. And if enough of those comforts become necessities, you eventually peel yourself away from any kind of common feeling with the rest of humanity.\n  I tell you all this not to defend myself; that\u2019s between me and my conscience. I am telling you this because human nature is a mighty force, and fighting it requires understanding it.\n What has caused me to question my indoctrination has been ethics. Goddamn ethics. For many people, especially those most deeply embedded in the culture of having and getting money, ethics are a wispy and ineffectual nuisance\u2014an abstract set of principles that can\u2019t possibly stand up to the rigors of life lived fast, business conducted efficiently, and competitors devoured and cast aside.\n The older I\u2019ve gotten and the more clearly I\u2019ve understood these things, the more the impulse to betray my own class has taken charge of my judgment.\n What\u2019s shocking about the ProPublica report is not just that the tax bills are so low, but that these billionaires can live with themselves.\n If your comfort requires that society be structured so that a decent percentage of your fellow citizens live in a constant state of terror about whether

companies are hiring for remote positions that can be performed in any state across the U.S. except one: Colorado.\n  At issue is a new Colorado law that requires companies with even a few employees in the state to disclose the expected salary or pay range for each open role they advertise, including remote positions. The rule\u2019s aim is to narrow  gender wage gaps and provide greater pay transparency for employees. To avoid having to disclose that information, though, some employers  seeking remote workers nationwide are saying that those living in Colorado need not apply.\n  Across the internet, an array of job listings state the work can\u2019t be done in Colorado. At Johnson &amp; Johnson, roles recently posted for a commercial finance senior manager and a senior manager in operations include  this caveat: \u201cWork location is flexible if approved by the Company except that position may not be performed remotely from Colorado.\u201d At commercial real-estate giant CBRE Group Inc., an ad for a project management director  notes in bold: \u201cThis position may be performed remotely anywhere within the United States except the State of Colorado.\u201d\n  At pharmaceutical distributor  McKesson  , postings for a sales specialist and a research quality manager include  similar disclaimers. Job listings for a scientist, an account executive and a manager of international tax planning at rival  Cardinal Health   also note: \u201cThis is a remote, work from home position. This role is to be filled outside of the state of Colorado.\u201d\n    Johnson &amp; Johnson and CBRE declined to comment, and McKesson and Cardinal Health didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n  Businesses have argued, in part, that Colorado\u2019s rules are overly burdensome administratively for employers. The Rocky Mountain Association of Recruiters, a trade group, sought an injunction against the pay transparency rules earlier this year. Last month, a federal judge denied that request, allowing the rules to stand.\n    While labor and legal experts say there is nothing technically stopping Coloradans from still applying and being eligible for such jobs, the disclaimers are likely to discourage people  wanting to work remotely from the state from pursuing such opportunities.\n  Do you think the Colorado pay law will spark a trend, or will other states be discouraged from passing similar legislation? Join the conversation below.\n  \u201cYou can\u2019t stop the internet essentially at a state line. Anyone can apply for anything,\u201d said Laura A. Mitchell, a Denver based principal at the law firm Jackson Lewis P.C. \u201cThe question comes down to whether or not an employer would actually consider that candidate for the role.\u201d\n  The job-posting language is also drawing scrutiny from Colorado officials. The state\u2019s Department of Labor and Employment recently opened an investigation into a complaint about at least one company\u2019s remote job posting excluding Colorado residents, said Scott Moss, director of the department\u2019s division of labor standards and statistics, who declined to name the company or who filed the complaint.\n  A number of states, including California, have enacted legislation in recent years that ban employers from asking for an applicant\u2019s salary history or added requirements for employers to disclose pay ranges upon request. One difference in Colorado\u2019s Equal Pay for Equal Work Act\u2014which went into effect in January\u2014is its provision that employers publicly disclose compensation and benefits for each job posting in the state.\n    In the remote-work era where jobs can conceivably be done anywhere, that has led to some confusion, state officials say. Colorado has told employers they don\u2019t need to disclose compensation for roles to be performed entirely outside of the state. Nor do the pay-disclosure requirements apply to remote jobs posted by a company that doesn\u2019t have any Colorado employees. But if an employer does have a presence in Colorado, it would need to post salary information\u2014even for a remote job\u2014Mr. Moss said.\n  Many companies now do include pay information specific to Colorado on remote job postings.  A listing for a software development engineer on a \u201cwork-from-anywhere\u201d team at  Amazon.com  for instance, notes that the range for the position in Colorado is $116,400 to $160,000 a year, but overall compensation could vary. Amazon\u2019s listing cites Colorado\u2019s Equal Pay for Equal Work Act as its reason for including the compensation information.\n  \u201cOur experience has been the law so far appears to be a great success at getting job postings to include the pay,\u201d Mr. Moss said.\n    Some Colorado remote workers say they are frustrated that other employers appear to be excluding them from such positions. Aaron Batilo, a software engineer near Denver, began working remotely in August 2019, and said he has found both greater pay and opportunities by remaining in Colorado and working for companies headquartered outside the state. When a former colleague mentioned that some remote job listings stated the positions were unavailable to Coloradans, his initial reaction was disbelief. \u201cThat would be such a red flag,\u201d he said.\n  But after spotting a discussion about more such postings on a Reddit forum last month, Mr. Batilo decided to act. He took a day off work and spent 12 hours building a site,  ColoradoExcluded.com, that tracks job listings that explicitly note they are not open to work in Colorado. He spends about five to 10 hours a week updating the site and manually verifying that listings exclude Colorado.

Ford is betting that the software developed by the three-year-old San Francisco startup will help it capture more than $1 billion in revenue just from charging by 2030. Ford Pro has financial ambitions beyond charging. The business unit said it expects to generate $45 billion in revenue from hardware and adjacent and new services by 2025 \u2014 up from $27 billion in 2019.\n Electriphi, along with its 30-person team, will be folded into the newly minted Ford Pro business unit, which is focused on providing services to commercial customers of its electric Transit van and F-150 Lightning Pro pickup truck. Ford will start shipping E-Transit to customers later this year. The F-150 Lightning Pro, a commercial variant of the all-electric Lightning pickup truck, is expected to come to market in spring 2022.\n  \u201cAs commercial customers add electric vehicles to their fleets, they want depot charging options to make sure they\u2019re powered up and ready to go to work every day,\u201d said Ford Pro CEO Ted Cannis. \u201cWith Electriphi\u2019s existing advanced technology IP in the Ford Pro electric vehicles and services portfolio, we will enhance the experience for commercial customers and be a single-source solution for fleet-depot charging.\u201d\n Electriphi launched in 2018 when it became obvious that upcoming state and federal mandates would drive heavy duty vehicles and mid-sized commercial fleets towards electrification, co-founder and CEO Muffi Ghadiali told TechCrunch in a recent interview. The company has focused on segments deploying commercial electric vehicles in the U.S. and internationally, a list that includes school buses and transit buses.\n \u201cIf you just think about what\u2019s going to happen in the next 10 years \u2014 it\u2019s a massive transformation in mobility for energy and software,\u201d\u00a0 Ghadiali said. \u201cThe stakes are incredibly high and time is running out.\u201d He noted fleet operators are nervous about that upcoming mandates that will require moving to zero-emissions vehicles by the end of the decade. \u201cTo turn over your entire fleet in 10 years, you have to start now; they\u2019re going, \u2018I have to make sure that my fleet operations don\u2019t skip a heartbeat, while this transition is happening.&#39;\u201d\n Ford first approached Electriphi in early 2021. The startup had raised just $4.2 million at a valuation of about $11 million prior to the deal with autoomaker.\n While Ford\u2019s focus is building out the software for its E-Transit and Lightning Pro, it is possible that it will also continue to serve Electriphi\u2019s customer base.\n \u201cInterestingly, as it turns out, the underlying Ford platform is used across many different vehicle types as well as school buses,\u201d Ghadiali said. \u201cSo it\u2019s hard to say which segments we won\u2019t still be in because they are you know they are very relevant to what we do. Of course, our focus will be the large volume that the Ford is going to ship in the next year.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-18 09:46:35", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u798f\u7279,\u6536\u8d2d,acquires", "title": "\u798f\u7279\u6536\u8d2dElectivehi\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u51c6\u5907Woo EV\u8230\u961f\u5ba2\u6237 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tFord acquires Electriphi as it prepares to woo EV fleet customers\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/ford-acquires-electriphi-as-it-prepares-to-woo-ev-fleet-customers/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u798f\u7279", "\u6536\u8d2d", "acquires"]}]
