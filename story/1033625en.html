Instead, they are acts of creation that are based on signals from the past. These signals provide an imperfect map to what the future could look like. It is up to a founder to see them, to interpret them, and to take the next step to build a new reality.  Successful ventures manage to tune into echoes that other people missed, or they find a way to remix and refine more obvious patterns into an offering that feels new, yet also eases an old irritant. In thinking about Steve Jobs and how successful creators have tuned into a message, and applied it somewhere else, it becomes clear why Jeffrey Katzenberg failed with Quibi.   The Precedent I would again hearken to Steve Jobs for the precedent. The iPhone was not a new product cut from whole cloth. It was a remix. It simultaneously illuminated and alleviated specific pain points. Problems that most consumers had simply grown to accept as baked into their daily experience of life. This execution was famously distilled into one line: “An iPod, a Phone, and an Internet Communicator.”  Sometimes new ventures are simply “I can do this better”. Google provides the example here. Larry and Sergei saw a clear signal: massive usage of search engines like Alta Vista and Infoseek. And they used their own software expertise to improve upon the past.  Within more subjective areas such as entertainment, the ambient signal is “I like this…and you might too.” This can also be understood as a “gut”. Creators with a singular vision - Christopher Nolan and Judd Apatow come to mind - using their own internal compass to find stories that they connect with, and craft them into something the audience wants. Ultimately, these are little more than guesses. But they do represent examples of how the creators tuned into a message, and applied it somewhere else. In a commercial context, studios like Blumhouse and A24 have found ways to systemize this idea into broader success.   What signals did Quibi hear? This is where I find the Quibi story interesting. What signals did they hear? And how did they inform the future that Jeffrey Katzenberg envisioned?  As one interprets public statements, Quibi’s management says they looked at a common signal: “broad and increasing consumption of mobile video”, and applied their own filter to what they saw as “good”. Upon doing so, Katzenberg decided he could deliver “good” in a way that others could not. But more importantly, Katzenberg seemed to believe that his version of “good” was better than what Youtube’s version of what “good” was.  Herein lies the most critical distinction between the Quibi vision and the reality of the marketplace. Katzenberg looked at one measure of quality: his own intuitive sense of what he liked. His “gut.” And he actively and vocally dismissed the more expansive signals from consumers, as defined by the billions of views that they paid to creators in places like Youtube, Instagram and Snapchat.  One might argue, as with the iPhone, this can lead to outsized success: zigging when others zag. In software and electronics, “good” is often measured by features: more storage, faster processor, more intuitive interface. On a more ephemeral level, it is also measured by “UX”. How well did the details work? And even more subjectively, how did this device or service make me feel? Excited to use it, or frustrated?</p><p>在史蒂夫·乔布斯(Steve Jobs)这句老生常谈的名言中，每一家创业公司、电影或其他雄心勃勃的追求背后都蕴含着这样一种理念：“我了解这个世界上其他人所不了解的东西。”这句老生常谈道：“人们不知道自己想要什么，除非你把它展示给他们看。”商业冒险很少是纯粹的信念飞跃。相反，它们是基于过去信号的创造行为。这些信号为未来的前景提供了一幅不完美的地图。这取决于创始人去看它们，去解释它们，并采取下一步来构建一个新的现实。成功的风险投资成功地调谐到其他人忽略的回声，或者他们找到了一种方法，将更明显的模式重新组合和提炼成一种新的产品，同时也缓解了一个旧的刺激。想想史蒂夫·乔布斯(Steve Jobs)，以及成功的创造者是如何调谐出一条信息，并将其应用到其他地方的，就会明白杰弗里·卡森伯格(Jeffrey Katzenberg)为什么在Quibi上失败了。这个先例我会再次听从史蒂夫·乔布斯(Steve Jobs)的先例。IPhone并不是一款全新的产品。这是一个混音。它同时照亮和缓解了特定的痛点。大多数消费者只是逐渐接受的问题，因为这些问题已经融入了他们的日常生活经验。这一处决被著名地提炼成一句话：“一部iPod、一部手机和一个互联网通讯器。”有时，新企业只是简单地说“我可以做得更好”。谷歌在这里提供了这个例子。拉里和谢尔盖看到了一个明确的信号：Alta Vista和Infoseek等搜索引擎的大量使用。他们利用自己的软件专业知识来改进过去。在更主观的领域，如娱乐，周围的信号是“我喜欢这个…。你可能也会这么做的。“。这也可以理解为一种“直觉”。脑海中浮现出克里斯托弗·诺兰(Christopher Nolan)和贾德·阿帕托(Judd Apatow)这两位有着独特愿景的创作者，他们用自己内心的指南针找到与之相关的故事，并将其打造成观众想要的东西。归根结底，这些只不过是猜测而已。但它们确实代表了创作者如何调谐到一条信息，并将其应用到其他地方的例子。在商业背景下，像Blumhouse和A24这样的制片厂已经找到了将这一想法系统化并取得更广泛成功的方法。基比听到了什么信号？这就是我觉得基比的故事很有趣的地方。他们听到了什么信号？他们是如何预测杰弗里·卡森伯格所设想的未来的呢？在解读公开声明时，Quibi的管理层表示，他们看到了一个共同的信号：“移动视频消费广泛且不断增加”，并对他们认为“好的”内容进行了自己的过滤。在这样做之后，卡森伯格决定他可以用别人做不到的方式来传递“好”。但更重要的是，卡森伯格似乎相信，他对“好”的看法比YouTube对“好”的看法要好。这就是Quibi愿景和市场现实之间最关键的区别。卡森伯格考察了一项衡量质量的指标：他自己对自己喜欢什么的直觉。他的“直觉”在YouTube、Instagram和Snapchat等网站上，消费者向创作者支付了数十亿次浏览量。他积极地、直言不讳地驳斥了消费者发出的更具扩张性的信号。有人可能会争辩说，就像iPhone一样，这可能会带来巨大的成功：当其他人在前进时，它会变得曲折。在软件和电子产品中，“好”的衡量标准通常是功能：更大的存储空间、更快的处理器、更直观的界面。在更短暂的层面上，它也是用“用户体验”来衡量的。细节效果如何？更主观地说，这个设备或服务给我带来了什么感觉？是兴奋地使用它，还是沮丧地使用它？</p><p>  Steve Jobs saw an opportunity to make objective improvements to a reality (bad touch screens, no internet browser, crappy voicemail) that consumers had come to accept because the marketplace had told them to accept it. Few companies sought to challenge this status quo, though Palm in the 2005-7 era does come to mind. Although he dismissed the value of focus groups, Jobs didn’t skate past consumers’ desires. Instead, he focused on the latent needs that were simultaneously unarticulated by the consumer, and dismissed by technologists due to the current marketplace dynamics.  This describes pretty clearly how Quibi’s core insight could just as easily have been the right one: that people had learned to accept the status quo of crappy YouTube videos as “good”, and had not yet experienced what “good” truly means.  In this way, Jeffrey Katzenberg said to us, “I understand something about the world that others do not.” And yet, in saying so, he missed the essential lesson that could have been gleaned from his own industry: Popular culture is an existential conflict between what is “good”, what people like, and what people watch. This dialectic is the central feature of cultural businesses. Entertainment is rife with commercial successes that are critically dismissed. Reality TV - like the now-20-year-old Survivor or The Bachelor - is the best example. Fox News is another, perhaps more pernicious, one.  More damning is the fact that in public comments, Katzenberg and cofounder, Meg Whitman eventually came to define “good” as merely “expensive,” using budget, not taste, as the key difference between what Quibi offered and what was already available. This, in my view, is the fatal mistake. By using budget as the signal, they missed a zeitgeist that has been hiding in plain sight for the last 15 years, since Youtube was founded, and to the utter consternation of big media executives. One might even argue that Katzenberg sneered at lessons from his own experience: that big budget movies often fail, and sometimes small moves are amazing. The tragedy, if one can call a prosaic business failure that, is that Katzenberg is not a man without taste. He built a career shepherding the creation of amazing things at Disney, and then later at Dreamworks.   Was it a valiant swing and miss by Katzenberg?  On one level, this track record is what enables me to see this from the perspective of, “they took a valiant swing and missed.” And yet, on another level, I see this failure in a more cynical light. That it was yet another old media executive who could not bear to accept the idea that a zero-budget YouTube creator had the same inherent value as an Oscar-winning actor. Or that the “anointment” from Hollywood was the essence of commercial success.  None of this is to pass judgement on the Quibi thesis of mobile’s worthiness as a platform. In fact, my own view, which I have touched on in twitter discussions, and can explore in more detail, is that mobile is an amazing platform, and is ultimately a massive market opportunity. It is defined by the combination of creation, curation and distribution. It is a multitude of creative expressions in an array of forms: Games, podcasts, talk radio, music, gifs, photos, movies, clips, written stories, books. The common thread under all of it is ideas. Creative ideas. “IP”.  I continue to believe that mobile will be the place where big content finds its origins. In fact, Spotify is hinting at this through its acquisitiveness in the podcast realm. Daniel Ek sees something I think I may also now see. That if you find a way to shepherd great, small IP, then that can eventually turn into bigger franchise value down the line. The genius of Spotify is to be able to rationalize this concept with value that is available in the here and now: “podcasts delivered to a huge installed base.” But I think the bigger idea is around what the podcast concepts can eventually become through different forms of mobile expression.   A Proposal: an IP-focused Fund I think that a smaller, open-ended creation fund may be an answer. There needs to be a foundation of technical development skill - the ability to express and integrate different modes of consumption and creation in one place (in an iPhone app?). The ability to distribute and manage it. And ultimately, most importantly, the ideas, stories and information that can be expressed through these technical platforms: The IP.  What I am describing here looks like a VC fund, but has some features of an incubator. I would not suggest that it makes sense to assemble a permanent team of developers and producers. But instead a light team of product experts who can bring expert-level development in when needed, and on good economic terms (either by paying fees or by sharing equity).  With creatively expressed ideas at the center, and a vision for how stories get told, I think such a model could redefine what a media company looks like in the future. And maybe in the process, it can create amazing and beautiful work.</p><p>史蒂夫·乔布斯(Steve Jobs)看到了对现实(糟糕的触摸屏、没有互联网浏览器、糟糕的语音邮件)做出客观改进的机会，消费者之所以接受这个现实，是因为市场告诉他们接受它。很少有公司试图挑战这一现状，尽管人们确实想到了2005-2007年的Palm。尽管乔布斯对焦点小组的价值不屑一顾，但他并没有忽视消费者的欲望。取而代之的是，他专注于潜在的需求，这些需求同时没有被消费者表达出来，而由于当前的市场动态，技术专家们对这些需求不屑一顾。这相当清楚地描述了Quibi的核心洞察力是如何轻易地成为正确的：人们已经学会接受YouTube上糟糕的视频的现状是“好的”，还没有经历过“好”的真正含义。通过这种方式，杰弗里·卡森伯格对我们说：“我了解这个世界上一些其他人不了解的东西。”然而，在这样说的时候，他错过了本可以从他自己的行业中学到的重要教训：流行文化是什么是“好的”，人们喜欢什么，以及人们看什么之间的生存冲突。这种辩证法是文化产业的核心特征。娱乐业充斥着商业上的成功，但遭到了批判性的驳斥。真人秀节目--就像现在20岁的《幸存者》或《单身汉》--是最好的考试</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://salildalvi.substack.com/p/learning-from-quibi">https://salildalvi.substack.com/p/learning-from-quibi</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/quibi/">#quibi</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/learning/">#learning</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/消费者/">#消费者</a></button></div></div><div class="shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded clearfix"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm"><div><a target="_blank" href="/story/1032845.html"><img src="http://img2.diglog.com/img/2020/11/thumb_3ec4ffcba00815c300ff18f153784a1b.jpeg" class="img-fluid" onerror="this.style.display='none'"></a></div><div class="item_title"><a target="_blank" href="/story/1032845.html">消息来源：Quibi考虑了像免费增值模式这样的选择，有45万个Subs支付了4.99美元/月，远远低于它关闭时第一年的740万目标</a></div><span class="my_story_list_date">2020-11-3 4:9</span></div><div class="col-sm"><div><a target="_blank" href="/story/1030696.html"><img src="http://img2.diglog.com/img/2020/10/thumb_3627ab89a5037b4d960b9555852c075e.jpg" class="img-fluid" onerror="this.style.display='none'"></a></div><div class="item_title"><a target="_blank" href="/story/1030696.html">
