to talk about chemical space \u2013 the universe of possible compounds \u2013 and I find that there is absolutely no way to do that without quoting Douglas Adams at the first opportunity. In   The hitchhiker\u2019s guide to the galaxy, Adams famously asserted, without fear of contradiction, that \u2018Space is big. Really big. You just won\u2019t believe how vastly, hugely, mind-boggling big it is.\u2019 Drop the word \u2018chemical\u2019 in there, and the same description applies.\n    Jorge Luis Borges struck a different note in his short story   The library of Babel. Like many of his famous works, it is an otherworldly thought experiment. It\u2019s set in a seemingly endless library that contains every possible permutation of identically sized books in a given alphabet. Every bit of knowledge that can be written down is there. And every variation of it is in there, too: all the misspellings, all the slightly wrong versions, all the flat-out mistakes and all the gibberish. The description convincingly makes the case that the gibberish is by far the most prominent part of the collection. Anyone who\u2019s ever worked with compound screening sets should read this, but they may find themselves shivering as they do.\n  So how big is our own library of Babel? Our alphabet is the periodic table, and our spelling and grammar are the rules of chemical bond formation and compound stability. There have been some computational forays into this question, most notably from  Jean-Louis Reymond and his group at the University of Bern in Switzerland. They\u2019ve enumerated a  set of plausible molecules (GDB17) with up to 17 heavy atoms (C, N, O, S and a halogen), and have a database of over 166\u00a0billion of them. But along the way, they had to do a great deal of paring down just to hold things to that number.\n  In chemical space, we have an effectively endless frontier. And you can be there this afternoon\n  A startling percentage of their compound backbones consisted of three- and four-membered rings concatenated into structures that no one can be sure are even stable, and are certainly beyond the current powers of organic synthesis. Adding those in would make the compound set many orders of magnitude larger, since only 0.005% of the original compound graphs were even considered as starting points. Their molecule generation process eliminated enamines, imines, most acetals, most isolated alkene compounds, most thioethers, and many other classes to make the final set more relevant (your screening library will definitely contain compounds that aren\u2019t in GDB17). It\u2019s still just a fragment-space set, though, with molecular weights well under 300.\n  Even after all that, it\u2019s 166\u00a0billion carefully curated small compounds, which needless to say dwarfs any possible fragment screening collection. What about larger compounds? The best guess for the number of plausible compounds up to molecular weight 500, letting many of those functional groups back in, is around 10 60. That is a number that the human mind is not well equipped to handle. That collection, assembled into compound vials at, say, 10mg per vial, would exceed the amount of ordinary matter in the entire universe. Actually, it might exceed the amount of ordinary matter in roughly 10,000 universes \u2013 depending on how big those vials are. I am leaving out such trivial details as the weight of the associated rack storage systems, the influences of dark matter and dark energy, and the likelihood of the compound collection itself undergoing gravitational collapse to form a black hole.\n  So against these terrifying numbers, what do we have to offer? Every compound collection that has ever been made by man is trivial against that background. Cutting the sub-500 molecular weight set down brutally, GDB17-style, might manage to take things out of the realm of cosmology, but would still bring it nowhere near anything that\u2019s manageable by humans. There are, I think, two reactions to this. One is despair, of course, which is always an option in research, but not a very useful one. The other is to see this as an opportunity. We are not going to run out of interesting and useful structures, and the uses that they could be put to are probably also beyond our imagining. In chemical space, we really do have an effectively endless frontier. And it\u2019s right there in front of every chemist; you can be there this afternoon.

In this review, only The Matrix is considered, and not its forks like  Gridify and other. Forks of the Matrix protocol can have significant differences. Currently, the Matrix has a clear advantage in supporting client software for all OS, while for financial reasons XMPP dominates only on Android.\n ~ 2 000 000 000 , including non federated XMPP messengers - WhatsApp, Zoom and etc  [1]  [2] In Federated network no known number of active users, but probably more than the number of servers.\n Unknown. Matrix.org site is not an authoritative and independent source. Matrix statistics 10 000 000 account include inactive users + users from other messers connected via bridges (!? API of other messengers is designed to connect bots and can be disabled at anytime)\n Uknown. Matrix.org site is not an authoritative and independent source. It is generally known that the statistics are overestimated in the group chats of the matrix. 15,000 matrix users create fewer posts than 100 XMPP users\n Yes. It is allowed to add the protocols of other messengers to the protocol XMPP (including the Matrix protocol). Anyone can write their own extension and add it to the protocol. An example of a comic expansion: &#34;XEP-0183: Jingle Telepathy Transport&#34; and fork protocol Signal &#34;XEP-0384: OMEMO Encryption&#34;. Nobody obliges to use or not to use extensions, but if the extension is in demand it will quickly spread to actively developed XMPP clients. Registration by phone numbers has not gained widespread acceptance, although it has some popularity among lazy users  [3]\n No. The protocol cannot be extended without the approval of the owners. If tomorrow the Matrix team makes it mandatory to register by phone and set the spy program, everyone will be obliged to comply.Any unapproved change protocol implies the creation of another new incompatible fork messenger (Matrix 1, Matrix Reload, Matrix Revolutions and etc). Similar splits into hundreds of forks occurred in bitcoin after its popularity, which forces users to install a separate duplicate application for the new fork.\n Symbiosis Company New Vector Ltd (Element/ Riot) (provides paid services) London, United Kingdom + The Matrix.org Foundation C.I.C. (collects donations).\n The French government blocks messengers with e2e encryption in the Apple Store and requires them to go through the state registration procedure. From federal XMPP messengers were blocked Monal (\u041e\u041c\u0415\u041c\u041e) and chatSecure (\u041e\u041c\u0415\u041c\u041e)  [4])\n OMEMO, OTR, OTR4, PGP ECC, PGP RSA (* It should be noted that OMEMO is a messenger Signal protocol integrated into XMPP as XEP)\n     Most users use only Matrix.org + Element /Riot (or forks) . Many of the private server owners also use &#34;&#39;element (riot)&#34; domain hosting.\n Yes (2 000 000 device to 1 node) [11] [12] (&gt; 1500 users = 1 GB ram )\n  No. Lack of funding. Clients exist on all platforms, but video calls only work well on Android. The commercial XMPP messengers Zoom and WhatsApp do not participate in the federation and do not open the source code\n The web client Element (Riot) is based on Electron (Chromium) and has support for all operating systems that support Chromium. There are no commercial matrix-based big messengers (except Element aka Riot)\n No. Most large XMPP servers with billions ( [14]  [15]) of users are not federated and do not invest in the development of the XMPP protocol\n XMPP is in usage by Google [16], WhatsApp [17], Zoom, IBM, LiveJournal, Nintendo [18], NSA, US military,Federal Police Germany  [19] and etc... A federated network adapted for millions of private servers with any number of users.\n Donations can pay for the maintenance of big amateur servers. The largest amateur federated server (xmpp.jp) with 886 487 accounts and ~ 30,000 active. .\n No. In the matrix, the main load of the network is located on super-nodes that a person with a small budget cannot create. The cost of maintaining amateur supernodes does not pay off the donation. Big supernodes must have commercial sponsors or government support to serve users. The largest amateurs servers host several hundreds active users.  [20] The matrix has not found application in free big messengers, but there are examples of using the matrix in sofrware that require payment for use (remote access program Teamvier).\n You don&#39;t need to worry yourself about your safety. Cloudflare proxy can automatically take care of proxying and caching your internet connections traffic, generating and renewing a security certificate. Even a beginner who is not familiar with base TLS encryption can configure and maintain the server. For big servers Matrix.org [ [21]] and Element.io [ [22]] the cost of its use is individual and depends on the load\n   Welcome back to the future! The Matrix&#39;s significant commercial successes are based on monopolization network against which the Matrix allegedly ideologically opposes (Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram, Zoom), but offering a really weak federal system. The better federated and decentralized XMPP has funding problems and lags behind in development client software for a couple of years from other monopolistic messengers(Matrix, Signal, WhatsApp [XMPP based], Telegram, Zoom [XMPP based]). From the point of view of XMPP developers, the Matrix is \u200b\u200boften viewed not as a federal system, but as another kind of monopoly messenger use weak extensibility federation as an advertising strategy.\n XMPP funding problems are directly related decentralization and to the reluctance of sponsors and goverements to invest in insubordinate systems", "posttime": "2021-06-26 04:13:05", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "xmpp", "title": "XMPP\u4e0e\u77e9\u9635 ", "title_en": "XMPP vs. Matrix", "transed": 1, "url": "https://wiki.404.city/en/XMPP_vs_Matrix", "via": "", "real_tags": ["xmpp"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1068309, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u55e8\uff0c\u6b22\u8fce\u6765\u5230\u7528\u6237inyerface\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u4e92\u52a8\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002  \u8981\u73a9\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u5730\u586b\u5199\u8868\u683c\u3002 ", "note_en": "Hi and welcome to User Inyerface,   a challenging exploration of   user interactions and design patterns.\n  To play the game, simply fill in the form   as fast and accurate as possible.", "posttime": "2021-06-26 04:12:41", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "ui,inyerface,\u6765\u5230", "title": "\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762 - \u6700\u5e38\u7528\u7684UI\u5b9e\u9a8c ", "title_en": "User Inyerface \u2013 A worst-practice UI experiment", "transed": 1, "url": "https://userinyerface.com/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["ui", "inyerface", "\u6765\u5230"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "bd68e91c57248cea0f5df69174baff05.jpg", "infoid": 1068306, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4ece\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u8c08\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4e0e\u6218\u9524remembrancer\u4e39\u963f\u514b\u65af\u7279\u5728\u6218\u4e89\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u5965\u79d8\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u73b0\u5728\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8f6c\u5411\u79d1\u5e7b\u822c\u7684\u8d22\u4ea7\uff0c\u4e00\u70b9\u5c11\u5f97\u591a\uff0c\u5609\u5bbe\u4e0eeIDET\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u805a\u5408\u7269\u9080\u8bf7\u65f6\u95f4\u65c5\u884c\u548c\u4e8b\u60c5\uff0c\u6b63\u5982\u4ed6\u4eec\u6240\u8bf4\uff0c\u4e00\u70b9\u5361\u5361\u3002\u6293\u4f4f\u4f60\u7684\u5783\u573e\u548c\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fdb\u5165\u6210\u50cf\u5ba4\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\uff06\uff0339;\u65f6\u95f4\u8c08\u8bba\u91cf\u5b50\u98de\u8dc3\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5f88\u5e78\u8fd0\u8db3\u4ee5\u4e0e\u4f20\u5947\u7535\u89c6\u5236\u4f5c\u4eba\u5510\u7eb3\u5fb7P.Bellisario\u9677\u5165\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u540d\u5b57\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f52\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e9b\u6700\u5177\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u548c\u6700\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7684\u7535\u89c6\u8282\u76ee\u7684\u95ed\u5e55\u5ea6\u548c\uff0339;

Grab your handlinks and step into the imaging chamber because it&#39;s time to talk about  Quantum Leap. We were lucky enough to snag some time with legendary TV producer  Donald P. Bellisario, whose name has graced the closing credits of some of the most influential and popular TV shows of the &#39;80s and &#39;90s\u2014including   Airwolf,  Magnum, P.I., and of course  Quantum Leap. Though he&#39;s now retired, Bellisario gamely agreed to allow an Ars film crew\u2014with props!\u2014into his California home to badger him with occasionally obscure questions about what is easily the best time-travel show ever to grace television.\n This was a special episode to film, if for no other reason than that  Quantum Leap was a special show. Today it feels like a relic from another age\u2014an age in which story serialization was the exception rather than the rule, where twenty-two episodes per season represented the expected minimum, and where commercial breaks were a bit less frequent. (The first-season episodes of  Quantum Leap clock in at almost  forty-eight minutes\u2014that&#39;s about six minutes longer than most hour-long dramas on network TV today!)  Quantum Leap&#39;s 97 episodes originally aired from 1989 to 1993, and the show was a huge part of my junior high and early high school experience\u2014though the parts of the show I wanted to see most were those rare glimpses into &#34;the future,&#34; the show&#39;s infrequently glimpsed vision of 1999 where Project Quantum Leap was taking place.\n    And what a future it was\u2014a future of neon and blinking lights, of cool blue lightning arcing across colored plastic, of &#39;90s retro-future fashion sense run amok, all overseen by an intelligent and somewhat snippy artificial intelligence named Ziggy. The time travel stories of the week were cool, but the overarching narrative about Project Quantum Leap is what really hooked me\u2014would Sam ever return home?\n Though there have been rumors floating around for years about a   Quantum Leap reboot, I want to temper expectations a bit: Don had a lot of neat stuff to tell us, but one thing you will not find in this interview is any discussion of whether or not  Quantum Leap will be coming back. It is Don&#39;s firm belief that Sam is still out there leaping\u2014and Sam has somehow made the conscious choice to continue doing it. It is, as Don puts it, Sam&#39;s life&#39;s work.\n So the heartbreaking ending of the series finale still stands: Sam Beckett never makes it back to his retro-neon 1999 home, and he&#39;s still out there somewhere, working with Al, striving to put right what once went wrong.\n I&#39;m hopeful that we&#39;ll be able to do at least one more episode of &#34;Unsolved Mysteries&#34; with Don\u2014 Airwolf, anyone? Stay tuned!\n  Slipping out of long time lurker mode to comment. Thank you for this interview Lee! I could have listened to Don talk for hours. Hopefully your interview helps to introduce a new audience to the show -- great stories and memories for me.\n Don was so nice\u2014and  super accommodating. We shot this at his house, and the film crew rolled up there with this giant Ziggy table that we built (it&#39;s nice having a budget sometimes!), and rather than telling us to GTFO, he said we could set up anywhere we wanted. We fought through connection issues (the producer and I were both dialed in on Zoom, so when Don is looking down and to his left, he&#39;s looking at me and Adam asking him questions on an iPad) and COVID precautions, and the end result was great. He was such a good sport.

But  fatal attacks nonetheless do happen\u2014and they happened even in prehistoric times. While examining the skeletal remains of a prehistoric hunter-gatherer cemetery in Japan dating back some 3,000 years, University of Oxford archaeologists found distinctive evidence that one such skeleton had been the victim of a fatal shark attack. They described their findings in\u00a0 a new paper published in the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports. It&#39;s the oldest known victim of a shark attack yet\u2014like a prehistoric cold-case film.\n The Tsukumo burial site in Japan&#39;s Okayama Prefecture was discovered by construction workers in the 1860s and first excavated in 1915. More than 170 human skeletons were unearthed and housed at Kyoto University. The site dates to the Late-Final  J\u014dmon\u00a0period of the Japanese archipelago. Co-authors\u00a0J. Alyssa White and Rick Schulting, both from Oxford, made their discovery while examining the remains for evidence of violent trauma, part of a larger study on violence in prehistoric Japan. Remains categorized as Tsukumo No. 24 showed marks of severe trauma that proved especially puzzling.\n &#34;We were initially flummoxed by what could have caused at least 790 deep, serrated injuries to this man,&#34;  said White and Schulting. &#34;There were so many injuries and yet he was buried in the community burial ground, the Tsukumo Shell-mound cemetery site.\u00a0The injuries were mainly confined to the arms, legs, and front of the chest and abdomen. Through a process of elimination, we ruled out human conflict and more commonly-reported animal predators or scavengers.&#34;\n    The team quickly realized the injuries were similar to those left by shark attacks on both modern and archaeological remains. According to the authors, sharks tend to attack (unprovoked) in three different ways. &#34;Hit and runs&#34; usually are single bites and occur in the surf zone; they are rarely fatal. In &#34;bump and bite&#34; attacks, a shark will circle its prey and bump them before attacking; and there is no advance warning when sharks execute a &#34;sneak attack.&#34; Those latter two attack types are far more likely to be fatal.\n    Injuries from shark attacks can leave very distinctive signs of trauma on the bones, typically caused by cutting, crushing, and tearing by those sharp, sharp teeth. Legs are particularly favored human targets, as is the thorax. Stripped flesh from arms and hands (&#34;degloving&#34;) often occurs because the victims try to defend themselves from the attack. Other bone-related evidence of a shark attack includes punctures, gouges, and fractures from the sheer force exerted by powerful jaws, and overlapping serrated (for white, bull, and tiger sharks) striations caused by the teeth scraping across the bone.\n These were the types of trauma the authors found on Tsukumo No. 24 during their examination, which involved creating 3D distribution maps of the injuries and comparing them to the photographs and CT scans of the skeleton. No. 24 was a young adult male with evidence of nearly 800 separate perimortem lesions and no signs of any initial stages of healing, meaning he would have died shortly after receiving the lesions.\n    Most of the injuries are concentrated on the pelvis, left leg, arms, and shoulders. Both the right leg and left hand are missing, and trauma to the remaining adjacent arm bones is consistent with the hand being torn off\u2014most likely a defensive wound. &#34;It is probable that the missing right leg was entirely separated from the body by the shark and either consumed or not recovered,&#34; the authors wrote.\n The left tibia had the highest number of deep bites, and nearly all the ribs were fractured, as was the pelvis. The authors suggest the chest cavity and abdomen may have been eviscerated, and they believe the young man was alive when he was attacked. Cause of death was probably severe loss of blood (exsanguination) given the likely severance of the femoral arteries and extreme shock. He probably died between 1370 to 1010 BC.\n &#34;Given the injuries, he was clearly the victim of a shark attack,&#34;  said White and Schulting. &#34;The man may well have been fishing with companions at the time, since he was recovered quickly. And, based on the character and distribution of the tooth marks, the most likely species responsible was either a tiger or white shark.&#34;\n The authors base that conclusion on the fact that the remains of both tiger and white sharks have been found at sites from the J\u014dmon\u00a0period. &#34;The Neolithic people of Jomon Japan exploited a range of marine resources,&#34;  said co-author Mark Hudson of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History. &#34;It&#39;s not clear if Tsukumo 24 was deliberately targeting sharks or if the shark was attracted by blood or bait from other fish. Either way, this find not only provides a new perspective on ancient Japan, but is also a rare example of archaeologists being able to reconstruct a dramatic episode in the life of a prehistoric community.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-26 03:35:47", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u88ad\u51fb,shark,\u9ca8\u9c7c", "title": "\u51b7\u6848\u6587\u4ef6\uff1a\u8003\u53e4\u5b66\u5bb6\u53d1\u73b03,000\u5c81\u7684\u9ca8\u9c7c\u88ad\u51fb\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005 ", "title_en": "Cold-case files: Archaeologists discover 3,000-year-old victim of shark attack", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/cold-case-files-archaeologists-discover-3000-year-old-victim-of-shark-attack/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u88ad\u51fb", "shark", "\u9ca8\u9c7c"]}]
