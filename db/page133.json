", "note_en": "Interestingly, those revenue figures have been adjusted to include fair value gains on cryptocurrency assets \u2014 it means that Revolut holds some crypto assets on its balance sheet. Revolut made $54 million (\u00a339 million) in fair value gains on cryptocurrency assets.\n Gross profit reached $170 million (\u00a3123 million) last year. At the same time, the company still reports operating losses. In particular, Q1 2020 was a particularly bad quarter with $76 million (\u00a355 million) in adjusted operating loss.\n  In 2020, total non-adjusted operating loss reached $277 million (\u00a3200.6 million). Like many tech companies, administrative expenses are responsible for this loss. With a staff of 2,200 people, the company spent $367 million (\u00a3266 million) on administrative costs alone. But things seem to be improving as you can see:\n  These trends aren\u2019t that surprising as I reported that fintech startups spent most of 2020  focusing on profitability and improving their margins. At the end 2020, Revolut had 14.5 million personal customers and 500,000 companies using Revolut Business.\n  \u201cAs the extraordinary circumstances of 2020 drove the trend towards digital financial management we continued to innovate for customers to make their financial lives easier and accelerate daily use. We launched 24 new retail and business products, expanded into the US, Japan and Australia and launched banking services in Lithuania, all while significantly improving our profitability,\u201d founder and CEO Nikolay Storonsky said in a statement. \u201cWe began 2021 with a more resilient and productive business that will enhance our trajectory towards rapid growth.\u201d\n When you compare Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, things are radically different for the fintech company. Revenue increased by 130% year-over-year and gross profit grew by 300% between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021.\n Revolut has been launching a ton of products to diversify its sources of revenue. It is increasingly becoming a financial super app with current accounts, debit cards, trading services, insurance products, premium subscriptions, cryptocurrency trading and more.\n Interestingly, interchange revenue from card transactions represents a good chunk of the company\u2019s revenue. In 2020, cards and interchange generated $131 million (\u00a395 million) in revenue. Every time a Revolut customer makes a card purchase, the card scheme (Visa or Mastercard) gives back some fees to Revolut. It\u2019s an incredibly small percentage-based fee, but it can add up when you generate millions of purchases.\n Foreign exchange and wealth generated $111 million (\u00a380 million) in revenue. That\u2019s another big one. And finally, subscriptions, such as Revolut Plus, Revolut Premium and Revolut Metal, accounted for $104 million (\u00a375 million) in revenue.\n Those are three strong pillars that all contribute to the company\u2019s bottom line. They all represent a bit less or a bit more than a third of the company\u2019s overall revenue.\n  While the company has expanded aggressively over the years, the U.K. is still by far its biggest market. In 2020, 88.4% of the company\u2019s (non-adjusted) revenue was related to its activities in the U.K. The European Economic Area without the U.K. represented 10.2% of revenue. The U.S., Japan, Australia and other markets were nearly negligible.\n Revolut has also raised a  mega round of funding in 2020 \u2014\u00a0a $500 million Series D round that was extended to $580 million in total. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the company launches an initial public offering within the next 12 months.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 19:52:36", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name":

out the company\u2019s Series A at $43.5 million, after the company  initially raised $18.5 million in April (some at the time reported this as its Series A, but it seems the round had yet to be completed). The full round includes Zeev Ventures, Vertex Ventures Israel, and Innovation Endeavors, with  Vintage Investment Partners added in this most recent tranche. DataRails is not disclosing its valuation, except to note that it has doubled in the last four months, with hundreds of customers and on target to cross 1,000 this year, with a focus on the North American market. It has raised $55 million in total.\n The challenge that DataRails has identified is that on one hand, SMBs have started to adopt a lot more apps, including software delivered as a service, to help them manage their businesses \u2014 a trend that has been accelerated in the last year with the pandemic and the knock-on effect that has had for remote working and bringing more virtual elements to replace face-to-face interactions. Those apps can include Salesforce, NetSuite, Sage, SAP, QuickBooks, Zuora, Xero, ADP and more.\n  But on the other hand, those in the business who manage its finances and financial reporting are lacking the tools to look at the data from these different apps in a holistic way. While Excel is a default application for many of them, they are simply reading lots of individual spreadsheets rather than integrated data analytics based on the numbers.\n DataRails has built a platform that can read the reported information, which typically already lives in Excel spreadsheets, and automatically translate it into a bigger picture view of the company.\n For SMEs, Excel is such a central piece of software, yet such a pain point for its lack of extensibility and function, that this predicament was actually the germination of starting DataRails in the first place,\n Didi Gurfinkel, the CEO who co-founded the company with Eyal Cohen (the CPO) said that DataRails\u2019 initially set out to create a more general purpose product that could help analyze and visualize anything from Excel.\n  \u201cWe started the company with a vision to save the world from Excel spreadsheets,\u201d he said, by taking them and helping to connect the data contained within them to a structured database. \u201cThe core of our technology knows how to take unstructured data and map that to a central database.\u201d Before 2020, DataRails (which was founded in 2015) applied this to a variety of areas with a focus on banks, insurance companies, compliance and data integrity.\n Over time, it could see a very specific application emerging, specifically for SMEs: providing a platform for FP&amp;A (financial planning and analytics), which didn\u2019t really have a solution to address it at the time. \u201cSo we enabled that to beat the market.\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re already investing so much time and money in their software, but they still don\u2019t have analytics and insight,\u201d said Gurfinkel.\n That turned out to be fortunate timing, since \u201cdigital transformation\u201d and getting more out of one\u2019s data was really starting to get traction in the world of business,  specifically in the world of SMEs, and CFOs and other people who oversaw finances were already looking for something like this.\n The typical DataRails customer might be as small as a business of 50 people, or as big as 1,000 employees, a size of business that is too small for enterprise solutions, \u201cwhich can cost tens of thousands of dollars to implement and use,\u201d added Cohen, among other challenges. But as with so many of the apps that are being built today to address those using Excel, the idea with DataRails is low-code or even more specifically no-code, which means \u201cno IT in the loop,\u201d he said.\n \u201cThat\u2019s why we are so successful,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are crossing the barrier and making our solution easy to use.\u201d\n The company doesn\u2019t have a huge number of competitors today, either, although companies like  Cube (which also  recently raised some money) are among them. And others like Stripe, while currently not focussing on FP&amp;A, have most definitely been expanding the tools that it is providing to businesses as part of their bigger play to manage payments and subsequently other processes related to financial activity, so perhaps it, or others like it, might at some point become competitors in this space as well.\n In the meantime, Gurfinkel said that other areas that DataRails is likely to expand to cover alongside FP&amp;A are likely to include HR, inventory, and \u201cplanning for anything,\u201d any process that you have running in Excel. Another interesting turn would be how and if DataRails decides to look beyond Excel at other spreadsheets, or bypass spreadsheets altogether.\n The scope of the opportunity \u2014 in the U.S. alone there are more than 30 million small businesses \u2014 is what\u2019s attracting the investment here.\n \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to reinvest in DataRails and continue working with the team to help them navigate their recent explosive and rapid growth,\u201d said Yanai Oron, General Partner at  Vertex Ventures, in a statement. \u201cWith innovative yet accessible technology and a tremendous untapped market opportunity, DataRails is primed to scale and become the leading FP&amp;A solution for SMEs everywhere.\u201d\n \u201cBusinesses are constantly about to start, in the midst of, or have just finished a round of financial reporting\u2014it\u2019s a never-ending cycle,\u201d added Oren Zeev, founding partner at Zeev Ventures. \u201cBut with DataRails, FP&amp;A can be simple, streamlined, and effective, and that\u2019s a vision we\u2019ll back again and again.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-21 19:52:18", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "datarails,financial", "title": "DataRails Books $ 25m\u4ee5\u4e0a\u4e3aSMBS\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8d22\u52a1\u62a5\u544a\u5de5\u5177 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tDataRails books $25M more to build better financial reporting tools for SMBs\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/datarails-books-25m-more-to-build-better-financial-reporting-tools-for-smbs/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["datarails", "financial"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "2f767704e76e7b1a004f41d1a06bcc46.jpg", "infoid": 1067189, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7845\u8c37\u79d1\u6280\u5de8\u5934\u5468\u4e00\u5ba3\u5e03\uff0c\u5b83\u5df2\u7ecf\u51b3\u5b9a\uff06\uff0334;\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u6253\u5f00\uff06\uff0334;\u5728\u4e1c\u4f26\u6566\u7684\u6821\u56ed\u88ab\u8feb\u5173\u95ed\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u3002\n  \uff06\uff0334;\u6211\u4eec\uff06\uff0339;\u91cd\u65b0\u5173\u95ed\u6821\u56ed\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6574\u4e2aU.K\u7684\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u3002\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u58f0\u79f0\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u7269\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e3a\u5168\u56fd\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002\n \u6821\u56ed\u4f26\u6566\uff0c\u5168\u7403\u51e0\u4e2a\u6821\u56ed\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4e8e2012\u5e74\u7531\u4ee5\u8272\u5217\u6280\u672f\u8001\u5c06\u548c\u8c37\u6b4c\u5458\u5de5Eze Vidra\u5f00\u5e55\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4f26\u6566\uff06\uff0339;\u542f\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u5f00\u59cb\u8d77\u98de\u3002\n Vidra\u5468\u4e00\u544a\u8bc9CNBC\uff0c\u6821\u56ed\u7684\u7ed3\u675f\u662f\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u82e6\u4e50\u53c2\u534a\u3002 \uff06\uff0334;\u751c\u871c\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u662f\u5b83\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u82e6\u6da9\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u662f\u5b83\u7684\uff06\uff0339;\u5b83\u7684\u4e00\u7aef\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u4ed6\u8bf4\u3002\n \uff06\uff0334;\u6211\u4e2a\u4eba\u5f88\u9ad8\u5174\u770b\u5230U.K.\u542f\u52a8\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5df2\u7ecf\u6210\u957f\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;

Campus in East London after it was forced to close by the coronavirus pandemic.\n  &#34;We&#39;re closing Campus to support start-ups throughout the U.K.,&#34; the company said, claiming that it can provide support for start-ups across the country without a physical space.\n Campus London, one of several Campus sites worldwide, was opened in 2012 by Israeli tech veteran and Google employee Eze Vidra as London&#39;s start-up scene began to take off.\n Vidra told CNBC on Monday that the closing of Campus is emotional and bittersweet. &#34;The sweet part is that it succeeded and the bitter part is that it&#39;s an end of an era,&#34; he said.\n &#34;I&#39;m personally very happy to see how the U.K. start-up ecosystem has grown,&#34; said Vidra, adding that it feels a bit like Campus is &#34;no longer needed as much&#34; now that London&#39;s start-up scene is established.\n  Located in the gentrified Shoreditch neighborhood \u2014 a few hundred meters from the Old Street gyratory system that became known as &#34;Silicon Roundabout&#34; \u2014 Campus was often thought of as being at the epicenter of London&#39;s Tech City, which some tech workers say  may never be the same again.\n  Campus contained co-working space, a cafe, and an event space. It was used by a variety of accelerators and start-up programs including Seedcamp, Entrepreneur First, Code First, and Silicon Drinkabout. There were thousands of events put on there over the years and Googlers used to come in and offer free mentoring to start-ups.\n Campus operated at a loss since its inception, Vidra said, adding that it was never meant to be revenue generating. &#34;It was quite a high investment,&#34; said Vidra, who is now a managing partner at Remagine Ventures.\n Google said the U.K. start-up community &#34;doesn&#39;t need access to a single shared physical space as much as it needs access to resources, mentors and programs available at scale, anywhere.&#34;\n &#34;When I first set foot in Campus London in 2012, it felt like magic,&#34; said Marta Krupinska, head of Google for Start-ups U.K., on Twitter. &#34;It&#39;s played a pivotal role in making London such a successful start-up ecosystem and after almost 10 years, a new chapter opens. So much to celebrate, and still so much work to do.&#34;\n  Sarah Drinkwater, who ran Campus from 2014 to 2018, said in  a blog on Monday: &#34;It&#39;s right that Campus won&#39;t re-open after the Covid closure. Scenes change, and you have to play it as it lays.&#34;\n Drinkwater, who worked on Google Maps before she joined Campus, said there are hundreds of coworking spaces in London and dozens and dozens of accelerators across the U.K. today.\n &#34;This one scrappy space on Bonhill Street provided the container for many different sub-communities to start or come together, and a way in for incredibly different profiles who wanted to find out what this &#39;tech&#39; thing was,&#34; wrote Drinkwater.\n &#34;Repeatedly, I&#39;d meet an uncertain early founder in the cafe trying to figure it out then bump into them, a year later, with a team and funding and a clear way forwards,&#34; said Drinkwater. &#34;Sometimes, those companies flew; sometimes they didn&#39;t and a great hire was back on the market.&#34;\n Tech entrepreneurs, developers and investors reminisced about their times at Campus on social media and in blog posts.\n &#34;So many great memories and good friends met there,&#34; wrote Amandine Flachs, the CEO and co-founder of Wild Meta AI, which aims to help video game developers create smarter and more human-like AIs with machine learning.\n Hannah Blake, CEO and co-founder of podcast app Entale, told CNBC it&#39;s a &#34;big loss&#34; and that it was &#34;the heart and soul of the London start-up scene.&#34;\n Andrew Eland, who worked at Google for over 11 years, leading teams in Silicon Valley working on Google Maps among other projects, said Campus broadened the people in the London technology scene, and the type of problems they worked on.\n &#34;I think the idea with all the Campus sites was to help incubate early tech communities, and London is obviously well beyond that stage now,&#34; Eland told CNBC.\n  With thousands of start-ups, London is now one of the main tech hubs in Europe, but the city is yet to spawn a tech behemoth on anything like Google&#39;s scale.\n &#34;While we still haven&#39;t produced a Google or a Facebook, we did 100 unicorns (businesses valued at $1 billion or more),&#34; said Vidra. &#34;Many of them had their first public pitch or appearance on the Campus stage including TransferWise and Revolut.&#34;\n Google operates other campuses in Madrid, Sao Paulo, Seoul, Tel Aviv, Tokyo and Warsaw. Google did not immediately respond when CNBC asked if it plans to close any of the other campuses.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 19:45:26", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "google,\u8c37\u6b4c,\u6821\u56ed,forced", "title": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u8feb\u4f7f\u5b83\u5173\u95ed\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u5b83\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u6253\u5f00\u6821\u56ed\u7684\u4f26\u6566\u7684\u542f\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4 ", "title_en": "Google says it has decided not to reopen Campus, its London-based startup space, after the pandemic forced it to close", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/21/google-campus-london-closes-to-start-ups-post-covid.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["google", "\u8c37\u6b4c", "\u6821\u56ed", "forced"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "36e8c23f1e5c0b5cfab1c198ca3d2cae.jpg", "infoid": 1067188, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5fb7\u56fd\uff06\uff0339;\u8054\u90a6\u5361\u7279\u5c14\u529e\u4e8b\u5904\uff0cBundeskartellamt\uff0c\u4eca\u5929\u542f\u52a8\u4e86\u5bf9Apple\u5173\u4e8e\u4e0eApp Store\uff0c\u5176\u4ea7\u54c1\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u670d\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53cd\u7ade\u4e89\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7d22\u8d54\u7684\u8bc9\u8bbc\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u3002\n \u4eca\u5929\u5ba3\u5e03\u7684\u82f9\u679c\u5ba3\u5e03\u5c06\u786e\u5b9aCupertino Tech Giant\u662f\u5426\u6301\u6709A\uff06\uff0334;\u8de8\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff06\uff0334;\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u82f9\u679c\u5747\u62e5\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u529b\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\uff06\uff0334;\u5176\u4ed6\u516c\u53f8\uff06\uff0334;\u6311\u6218\u5b83\u3002\n  \u6211\u4eec\u73b0\u5728\u5c06\u5ba1\u67e5\u5176\u4e13\u6709\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edfIOS\uff0cApple\u5728\u5176iPhone\u5468\u56f4\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u5b57\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u904d\u5e03\u591a\u4e2a\u5e02\u573a\u3002 Apple\u751f\u4ea7\u5e73\u677f\u7535\u8111\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u548c\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e0e\u8bbe\u5907\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u5236\u9020\u5404\u79cd\u786c\u4ef6\u4ea7\u54c1\u5916\uff0c\u6280\u672f\u516c\u53f8\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9bApp Store\uff0cIcloud\uff0cAppleCare\uff0cApple Music\uff0cApple Arcade\uff0cApple TV +\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5176\u670d\u52a1\u4e1a\u52a1\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7acb\u573a\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u9762\u5ba1\u89c6\u5176\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u5e02\u573a\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u5176\u6280\u672f\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u91cd\u70b9\u662f\u5e94\u7528\u5546\u5e97\u7684\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4f7fApple\u80fd\u591f\u5f71\u54cd\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u7684\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\n \u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u5bf9\u5176\u8c03\u67e5\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u7f3a\u70b9;\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8be5\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5b83\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e00\u5bb6\u8de8\u5e02\u573a\u91cd\u89c6\u7684\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u7981\u6b62\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u6765\u81ea\uff06\uff0334;\u4ece\u4e8b\u53cd\u7ade\u4e89\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\n \u8be5\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u8868\u793a\u5df2\u6536\u5230\uff06\uff0334;\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u53cd\u7ade\u4e89\u5b9e\u8df5\u6709\u5173\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u6295\u8bc9\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e0e\u6700\u8fd1\u7684ATT\u63a8\u51fa\u6216\u5e94\u7528\u8ddf\u8e2a\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u5173\u3002 4\u6708\u4efd\uff0c\u4e5d\u4e2a\u884c\u4e1a\u534f\u4f1a\u4ee3\u8868Facebook\u548c\u51fa\u7248\u5546Axel Springer\u7b49\u516c\u53f8\u5411\u8054\u90a6\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u63d0\u8d77\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u6295\u8bc9\uff0c\u58f0\u79f0Apper\uff06\uff0339;

", "note_en": "Germany&#39;s Federal Cartel Office, the Bundeskartellamt, today initiated proceedings against Apple on the claims of anti-competitive behavior related to the  App Store, its products, and other services, according to a  press release.\n The proceeding against Apple announced today will determine whether the Cupertino tech giant holds a &#34;paramount significance across markets&#34; and whether, through its ecosystem, Apple holds enough power to make it difficult for &#34;other companies&#34; to challenge it.\n  We will now examine whether with its proprietary operating system iOS, Apple has created a digital ecosystem around its  iPhone that extends across several markets. Apple produces tablets, computers and wearables and provides a host of device-related services. In addition to manufacturing various hardware products, the tech company also offers the \u200cApp Store\u200c,  iCloud,  AppleCare,  Apple Music,  Apple Arcade,  Apple TV+ as well as other services as part of its services business. Besides assessing the company\u2019s position in these areas, we will, among other aspects, examine its extensive integration across several market levels, the magnitude of its technological and financial resources and its access to data. A main focus of the investigations will be on the operation of the \u200cApp Store\u200c as it enables Apple in many ways to influence the business activities of third parties.\n The press release is short on specifics on what the outcome of its investigation may lead to; however, the office says that if it determines a company to be of importance across markets, it may prohibit that company from &#34;engaging in anti-competitive practices.&#34;\n The office says it has received &#34;various complaints relating to potentially anti-competitive practices,&#34; particularly related to the recent rollout of ATT or the App Tracking Transparency framework. In April, nine industry associations representing companies like Facebook and publisher Axel Springer  filed an antitrust complaint to the federal office, claiming that Apple&#39;s ATT framework will severely hurt publishers and their bottom lines, deeming it a threat to their business.\n According to the press release, another complaint that the office received related to the pre-installation of Apple&#39;s own apps on its devices. The office directly references section 19a of the German Competition Act, which states &#34;the abuse of a dominant position by one or several undertakings is prohibited&#34; as a potential clause that Apple may be violating.\n Russia recently took the first major step against Apple for the pre-installation of its own apps, requiring the company to  show users a screen to download government-approved apps during initial device setup. Similar legislation being proposed in the U.S. Congress  would require Apple to give users the ability to delete all pre-installed Apple apps, instead of a select handful that users may currently delete.\n The Bundeskartellamt also lists ongoing disputes regarding Apple&#39;s in-app purchasing system, which gives the tech giant a 30% commission of all purchases made and the restriction that apps may only be distributed on Apple devices through the company&#39;s \u200cApp Store\u200c and not other third-party app marketplaces.\n Ummm, that\u2019s the main reason I buy Apple devices. It\u2019s all integrated, I can see all my stuff across multiple devices etc. I buy into Apple because it IS ring fenced and controlled!\n Why is this not a problem with cars? How come I can&#39;t install and sideload any apps inside my car system? Tesla doesn&#39;t allow me to install some kind of carplay app or even have perhaps a music streaming service of my choice.. Honestly, I&#39;m not sure this is all in the best interest of consumers.. Yes, the competition is good.. But if the cars get taken over by virus&#39;s and starting killing people, is that ok also? I continue to think the walled garden is a good choice.. Even if it limits dev&#39;s in some ways.. You know when they used to sell retail software in stores, the stores/wholesale pipeline took over 75% of the profits.. And was that not a problem before??\n Russia, Germany, who\u2019s next? ?  Don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t use it, android is that way ?\u200d\u2642\ufe0f?\n  Yup.  I think that&#39;s the most reasonable compromise. Add a setup screen where you get to pick default apps. Randomize those apps, and either have them curated (that comes with the problem: who does the curation?) or perhaps auto-generated based on App Store popularity.  Something like this, but for more types of apps:\nIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it ? if people want spyware and malware, android is over there ?\n  After a long wait, YouTube for iOS is officially gaining picture-in-picture support, allowing all users, non-premium and premium subscribers, to close the YouTube app and continue watching their video in a small pop-up window.\rIn a statement to MacRumors, YouTube says that picture-in-picture is currently rolling out to all premium subscribers on iOS and that a larger rollout to all US iOS...\n The Apple news cycle started to move beyond WWDC this week, but that doesn&#39;t mean there still wasn&#39;t a lot to talk about, led by the official debut of the much-leaked Beats Studio Buds that might give us a hint of what to expect for the second-generation AirPods Pro.\rWith no hardware announcements at WWDC, we also took a look at when we might finally see the long-rumored redesigned MacBook...\n A wireless network naming bug has been discovered in iOS that effectively disables an iPhone&#39;s ability to connect to Wi-Fi.\rSecurity researcher Carl Schou found that after joining a Wi-Fi network with the name &#34;%p%s%s%s%s%n&#34; his iPhone&#39;s Wi-Fi functionality was left &#34;permanently disabled.&#34; Changing a hotspot&#39;s SSID did nothing to correct the problem, with even a reboot failing to make a...\n With iOS 15 and macOS Monterey, Apple is adding several quality of life improvements, which are designed to address some of the complaints that people have had with these operating systems for years now.\rSubscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.
