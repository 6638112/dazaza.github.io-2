Chauffeurs were waiting to take everybody to the airport for a trip to Hawaii.</p><p>   安迪Hsieh在康涅狄格州新伦敦的一个海滨家的棚屋门上敲了一下。，并说是时候走了。司机正在等待将每个人带到机场前往夏威夷。</p><p>  His brother  Tony, the mastermind and former chief executive of Zappos Inc., had locked himself inside with a propane space heater and canisters of nitrous oxide, a mind-altering gas he habitually used. He asked Andy for five more minutes.</p><p>  他的兄弟托尼，Zappos Inc.的前任首席执行官们已经用丙烷空间加热器和氧化亚罐的罐子锁定了自己的内部，他习惯性地使用的思想改变气体。他问了五分钟。</p><p>  A recording of a predawn 911 call on Nov. 18 captured people yelling for the security code to open the shed’s electronic lock. A chorus of voices screamed “Tony! Tony!” over and over.</p><p>  在11月18日录制预先录制的911次呼叫捕获的人为安全码大喊大叫，以打开棚屋的电子锁。声音的合唱尖叫“托尼！托尼！“一遍又一遍。</p><p>  Nearly all of the people trying to break into the shed, including Andy, were on Mr. Hsieh’s payroll, part of an entourage of paid followers enlisted in his spiritual journey.</p><p>  几乎所有试图闯入棚屋的人都在包括安迪先生的薪酬先生，这是有偿追随者在精神之旅中的一个随行者的一部分。</p><p>    For most of the year before his death, the retired 46-year-old entrepreneur bankrolled an assembly of longtime friends, former Zappos employees and aspiring musicians who had followed him to Park City, Utah. The entourage lived in and around Mr. Hsieh’s 17,350-square-foot mansion, a dozen or so men and women drawing salary and commissions from Mr. Hsieh’s $840 million fortune. He had offered to double the existing salaries of people who moved to Park City to work for him.</p><p>    在他去世前的大部分时间，退休的46岁的企业家在长期朋友，前Zappos员工和有抱负的音乐家举行了一个长期的朋友，他们跟随他去公园城市，犹他州。随行人员在Hsieh的17,350平方英尺的豪宅，十几个左右的男人和妇女中居住在Hsieh先生的薪水和佣金。他提出将搬迁到公园城市的人民的现有工资加倍。</p><p>    The group was ostensibly in the service of Mr. Hsieh, who was searching for his next big project and hoping he could help people live in harmony and discover their true purpose. In practice, Mr. Hsieh stood at the center of a communal enterprise where followers enabled his drug and alcohol habits while jockeying for control of projects that paid financial rewards.</p><p>    本集团在寻求其下一个大项目的Hsieh先生的服务中，希望他能够帮助人们和谐地生活并发现他们的真实目的。在实践中，Hsieh先生站在一家公共企业的中心，追随者使他的药物和酒精习惯能够控制有资金奖励的项目的控制。 </p><p>  This account is based on interviews with Mr. Hsieh’s friends and employees, as well as documents related to Mr. Hsieh’s last months, including notes, photos, schedules and videos; public records from police and fire agencies in Park City and New London; emails from Park City officials; filings in Mr. Hsieh’s estate case; and court records.</p><p>此帐户基于与Hsieh先生的朋友和员工的访谈，以及与Hsieh先生的最后几个月相关的文件，包括笔记，照片，计划和视频;公园城市和新伦敦的警察和消防机构的公共纪录;公园城市官员的电子邮件; Hsieh先生的遗产案件申请;和法庭记录。</p><p>  Mr. Hsieh believed inhaling nitrous oxide, legal for medical and industrial uses, would help people reach spiritual enlightenment, and he wanted to attract the like-minded to live in Park City. He paid for a 34-minute video to show newcomers espousing the intoxicating gas and its use by 19th-century philosopher William James. Mr. Hsieh had scribbled in a cardboard box what he described as an algorithm that would bring world peace and showed it to visitors.</p><p>  Hsieh先生认为，对医学和工业用途的合法氧化二氮氧化物将有助于人们达到精神启示，并且他想吸引志同道合的住在公园城市。他支付了34分钟的视频，以表明新人支持醉酒的天然气及其在19世纪哲学家威廉·詹姆斯的使用。 Hsieh先生潦草地潦草地潦草地潦草地涂上了他所描述的算法，这些算法将带来世界和平并将其显示给游客。</p><p>  Seeking to be close to nature, Mr. Hsieh’s group at one point gave up cleaning inside and out, and dog droppings littered the property. Faucets ran constantly to mimic waterfalls.</p><p>  Hsieh先生在一点地靠近大自然，在一点放弃了内外清洗，狗粪落下了物业。水龙头不断跑到模仿瀑布。</p><p>  During police interviews after the fire, a member of the Park City entourage told an officer that he and his fiancée worked for Mr. Hsieh. The business, he told the officer, didn’t have a name. “I asked how the business makes money and he laughed saying that he didn’t mean ‘business’ in that way, as in making money,” the officer wrote in his report.</p><p>  在火灾之后的警察采访中，公园城市随行者的成员告诉了一名官员，他和他的未婚妻为Hsieh先生工作。这项业务，他告诉总监，没有名字。 “我询问业务是如何赚钱的，他笑话说他并不是那种方式”商业“，就像赚钱一样，”这位官员在他的报告中写道。</p><p>  While Mr. Hsieh lay unconscious in the hospital, his followers in Park City and those with him in New London appeared to carry on as normal. One entry from an assistant’s schedule noted: “Cleaned after the fire, dealing with police and fire department…Priorities this week: getting a quote on wrapping the tree on the patio with LED lights, would really add to the space.”</p><p>  虽然Hsieh先生在医院露出无意识，但他在公园城的追随者和新伦敦与他的追随者似乎正常进行。从助理的附表中指出的一个条目：“火灾后清理干净，处理警察和消防部门......本周优先事项：在带有LED灯的露台上包裹树木的引用，真的会增加空间。”</p><p>  Mr. Hsieh’s companions pursued loosely connected business ventures that he financed. Some received six-figure salaries, and others received commissions for coming up with ideas and business plans, such as a hotel and bar named after Mr. Hsieh’s dog, Blizzy, a small terrier mix.</p><p>  Hsieh先生的同伴追求了他资助的松散连接的商业企业。有些人接受了六分之一的薪水，其他人收到了委员会来提出想法和商业计划，例如在Hsieh的狗先生，闷闷不乐的小猎犬混合后命名的酒店和酒吧。</p><p>  The Park City patron belonged to an early generation of Silicon Valley startup stars, making his name at age 24 with the 1998 sale of his first company, an internet advertising outfit. With his new wealth, around $32 million, Mr. Hsieh became known as a generous companion and surrounded himself with friends, enjoying vodka, cigarettes and raves.</p><p>  Park City Patron属于早期一代硅谷初创型明星，在24岁时，他的名字在1998年出售他的第一家公司，是一个互联网广告服装。凭借他的新财富，大约3200万美元，Hsieh先生被称为慷慨的伴侣，并与朋友一起包围，享受伏特加，香烟和狂欢。 </p><p>  After the dot-com bust, Mr. Hsieh championed a novel and profitable way to sell shoes, offering online customers multiple styles, sizes and brands—without having to make them or stock them. Zappos didn’t need storefronts or salespeople, and it didn’t rely on passersby at the mall or on Main Street. Customers could shop 24/7 on their computers.</p><p>在Dot-Com Bust之后，Hsieh先生赢得了一种新颖和有利可图的方式来销售鞋子，为网上客户提供多种风格，尺寸和品牌 - 而无需制造它们或储存。 Zappos不需要店面或销售人员，并且它并没有依赖商场或主要街道的路人。客户可以在他们的电脑上购买24/7。</p><p>    Mr. Hsieh put a premium on customer service, swift deliveries and easy returns. The company’s business model expanded, and, in 2009, Mr. Hsieh sold Zappos to Amazon.com Inc. for more than $1 billion and stayed on as CEO until August. His leadership style: Work hard, party hard.</p><p>    Hsieh先生在客户服务，迅速交付和轻松回报中提出保费。该公司的商业模式扩展，2009年，Hsieh先生将Zappos销售给Amazon.com Inc.超过10亿美元，并担任CEO，直到8月份。他的领导风格：努力工作，党难。</p><p>  At Zappos, Mr. Hsieh directed a high-profile management experiment in which the company operated without managers or job titles. He gained a broad following of business leaders and government officials who made pilgrimages to the company’s headquarters each year to see it.</p><p>  在Zappos，Hsieh先生指导了一个高调的管理实验，其中公司没有经理或职称。他每年向公司总部致敬的商业领袖和政府官员获得了广泛的推广，致力于公司的总部。</p><p>  Mr. Hsieh, who was known for never missing a meeting or running late, spiraled in the last months of his life. He was sometimes so high on nitrous oxide and other drugs that he couldn’t speak properly during meetings about real-estate investments and other business.</p><p>  Hsieh先生，被众所周知的从未错过会议或跑步，在他生命的最后几个月里螺旋化。氧化亚氮和其他药物的氧化亚氮和其他药物在关于房地产投资和其他业务的会议期间无法正常发言。</p><p>  His Park City entourage, loyal to his desires, discussed how to grow hallucinogenic mushrooms instead of buying them, according to sticky notes viewed by the Journal. They set aside time to clear Mr. Hsieh’s bedroom of empty nitrous oxide canisters, according to schedules viewed by the Journal. Family and friends who had worried about Mr. Hsieh’s health said these companions kept him isolated and resisted outside efforts to help. Mr. Hsieh regarded intervention as disloyal, and none around him wanted that label.</p><p>  根据期刊观看的粘滞便笺，他讨论了他忠于渴望他的欲望，讨论了如何种植致幻蘑菇而不是购买它们。根据期刊的时间表，他们留出了时间来清除Hsieh先生的空氧化亚罐罐的卧室。担心Hsieh先生的健康的家庭和朋友表示，这些同伴让他孤立并抵制了外面的帮助。 Hsieh先生认为干预是不忠诚的，而且他周围想要那个标签。</p><p>    New London’s police and fire departments launched an investigation to learn how the fire started and whether anyone was to blame. The state medical examiner’s office concluded Mr. Hsieh’s death, nine days after firefighters rescued him from the burning shed, was the result of complications from smoke inhalation.</p><p>    新的伦敦警察和消防部门推出了调查，了解火灾如何开始以及是否有人责备。国家医学审查员的办公室总结了Hsieh先生的死亡，消防员从燃烧的棚子救出他九天后，是吸入的并发症的结果。</p><p>  Among the many friends the entrepreneur made over his life, some said the cause of his death had spanned many months, in plain sight to those who surrounded him. Last summer, his Park City companions hired an on-call doctor. Unless Mr. Hsieh moderated his drug and alcohol use, the doctor said, he would die within six months.</p><p>  在许多朋友中，企业家在他的生命中取得了一生，有些人表示，他的死亡事业已经跨越了许多月，这是对那些包围他的人的看法。去年夏天，他的公园城市同伴聘请了一名随叫的医生。除非Hsieh先生进行了他的药物和酒精使用，否则医生说，除非医生说，除非他将在六个月内死亡。 </p><p>  A spokeswoman for the Hsieh family declined to comment. Some people named in this article didn’t return calls for comment; others declined to comment.</p><p>Hsieh家族的发言人拒绝发表评论。在本文中命名的一些人没有回复评论;其他人拒绝发表评论。</p><p>   By the time Mr. Hsieh moved Zappos headquarters to Las Vegas in 2013, the company had more than 1,500 employees and yearly revenue greater than $2 billion.</p><p>   何时将Zappos总部推向2013年的拉斯维加斯，该公司拥有超过1,500多名员工，每年收入超过20亿美元。</p><p>  He bought 60 acres and converted more than a dozen 40-foot shipping containers into a retail development known as Container Park. It was part of a $350 million or so investment he made in a neglected section of the city’s downtown. At the entrance to Container Park, Mr. Hsieh erected a sculpture of a praying mantis that he had retrieved from the Burning Man festival. The 40-foot-tall insect had its own operators, and, every night, its two mechanical antennae shot twin streams of fire into the sky.</p><p>  他买了60亩，并将十几辆40英尺的运输集装箱转换成一个被称为集装箱公园的零售业。这是一个3.5亿美元左右的一部分，他在城市市中心的忽视部分中制作的投资。在集装箱公园的入口处，Hsieh先生竖立了一个祈祷螳螂的雕塑，他已经从燃烧的人节中取出。 40英尺高的昆虫有自己的运营商，并且每天晚上，它的两个机械天线拍摄了两只射入天空的双重火。</p><p>    “The whole thing was brand new and fresh, and it was part of this whole hope of a greater revitalization of downtown Las Vegas,” said Doug McPhail, a former director for Mr. Hsieh’s downtown Las Vegas development, which included Container Park. He got a heads-up before first meeting Mr. Hsieh. “If he doesn’t say anything throughout the entire lunch, don’t be offended,” he recalled hearing, though Mr. Hsieh turned out to be chatty.</p><p>    “整件事人是全新的，新鲜的，这是振兴拉斯维加斯市中心更加振兴的全部希望的一部分，”Hsieh的市中心拉斯维加斯先生发展主任，包括集装箱公园。他在第一次举行了Hsieh先生之前获得了一个头脑。 “如果他在整个午餐中没有说什么，不要被冒犯，”他回忆道，虽然Hsieh先生原来是聊天。</p><p>  On stage at a tech event or at Zappos, Mr. Hsieh was well-spoken, witty and self-confident. He was less comfortable in one-on-one conversations. Yet he found new friends in Las Vegas, and many moved to be near him and Blizzy, Mr. Hsieh’s dog, in a cluster of Airstream trailers near Container Park. The tiny residential community had a stage for visiting performers and threw parties almost every night.</p><p>  在科技活动或Zappos的舞台上，Hsieh先生说道，诙谐和自信。他在一对一的谈话中不太舒适。然而，他在拉斯维加斯找到了新朋友，许多人在靠近他附近，哈伊赫先生的狗，在集装箱公园附近的气流拖车集群中。小型住宅区几乎每晚都有一个舞台才能参观表演者和召唤派对。</p><p>  The entrepreneur’s attempt to revitalize downtown Vegas later floundered. And, at Zappos, the no-titles management experiment caused friction among employees. By the end of 2019, close friends worried about Mr. Hsieh’s physical and mental health. His behavior was becoming erratic. He attended shaman-led retreats outside of Las Vegas that focused on hallucinogenic drugs. To try to boost his mental performance, he began taking ketamine, a medical anesthetic that was commandeered by street users as a party drug.</p><p>  企业家试图振兴市中心以后挣扎。而且，在Zappos，No-Titles管理实验导致员工之间的摩擦。到2019年底，亲密的朋友担心Hsieh先生的身心健康。他的行为变得不稳定。他参加了位于拉斯维加斯以外的萨满导致的撤退，专注于致幻药物。为了试图提高他的心理表现，他开始服用氯胺酮，是一名医学麻醉剂，被街头用户作为党的药物。</p><p>  At Zappos, he seemed checked out. Meetings at local bars that had once started at 4 p.m. moved to 10 a.m.</p><p>  在Zappos，他似乎检查过了。曾在下午4点开始的地方酒吧会议。搬到了上午10点。 </p><p>  Early last year, friends persuaded Mr. Hsieh to enter a rehabilitation program at the celebrity facility Cirque Lodge in Park City. After spending two weeks there, he intended to remain in town a month. Mr. Hsieh often attended the annual Sundance Film Festival in Park City, and he traveled there from Las Vegas other times of the year.</p><p>去年年初，朋友们说服了Hsie先生在公园城的名人设施Cirque Lodge进入康复计划。花了两个星期后，他打算一个月留在镇上。 Hsieh先生经常参加了公园城市的年度日光电影节，并在今年的其他时间从拉斯维加斯旅行。</p><p>  The coronavirus upended his plans, triggering lockdowns across the U.S. He was stuck, and then he decided to stay.</p><p>  Coronavirus颠覆了他的计划，触发美国的锁定，他被困，然后他决定留下来。</p><p>   Mr. Hsieh was obsessed with creating what he called collisions between people to spark the next great idea, and he believed communal spaces made that easier. That was his hope for Park City and the sprawling mansion property he called the Ranch.</p><p>   Hsieh先生痴迷于创造他在人们之间互相碰撞的东西，以激发下一个好主意，他认为公共空间更容易。这是他对公园城市和庞大的豪宅房产，他称之为牧场。</p><p>  In the months after leaving the rehab program, Mr. Hsieh persuaded a handful of people to move to Park City. They eventually formed what he called his core team. He envisioned a mecca focused on mindfulness and personal growth, a spiritual journey fueled, in part, by alcohol, nitrous oxide and psychedelic mushrooms.</p><p>  在离开康复计划后的几个月里，Hsieh先生说服了少数人搬到Park City。他们最终形成了他所谓的核心团队。他设想了一个专注于正念和个人成长的麦加，部分是由酒精，氧化亚氮和迷幻蘑菇燃烧的精神之旅。</p><p>  Ideas flowed onto thousands of handwritten sticky notes that formed green, yellow, blue and orange mosaics on the walls of the Ranch. Mr. Hsieh spent about $70 million on Park City real estate, mostly houses, as investments and to make room for newcomers. One set of sticky notes showed plans for new real-estate deals totaling tens of millions of dollars more.</p><p>  在牧场墙上形成了成千上万的手写粘滞便笺的想法，形成了绿色，黄色，蓝色和橙色马赛克。 Hsieh先生在公园城市房地产上花了大约7000万美元，主要是房屋，作为投资，为新人提供空间。一套粘滞便笺显示新房地产的计划，总计数千万美元更多。</p><p>    Mr. Hsieh hired a team of court reporters to follow him around and keep track of his ideas.</p><p>    Hsieh先生聘请了一支法院记者团队跟随他并跟踪他的想法。</p><p>  One member of the core team, Suzie Baleson, had met Mr. Hsieh in Las Vegas around the time she started her business, Wellth Collective. She acted as Mr. Hsieh’s business manager in Park City, while planning fitness- and wellness-theme events.</p><p>  核心团队Suzie Baleson的一名成员在她开始她的业务，Wellth集体的时候遇到了拉斯维加斯的Hsieh先生。她作为Hsieh先生在Park City的业务经理，而计划健身和健康主题活动。 </p><p>  Ms. Baleson worked with Park City officials on a citywide wellness program, and she hosted Park City Mayor Andy Beerman at the Ranch. He was excited by what he described as the group’s positive energy. “Your ‘stoke’ reminds us of why we are so lucky to live here,” the mayor wrote in an email to Ms. Baleson in late September.</p><p>Baleson女士在全市的健康计划上与Park City官员合作，她在牧场举办了公园城市市长安迪贝恩。他被他所描述的是集团的积极能源的兴奋。 “你的”斯托克“提醒我们为什么我们很幸运地住在这里，”市长在9月下旬发送到Baleson女士的电子邮件。</p><p>  Mr. Hsieh’s core team also included Elizabeth Pezzello, who had worked as an aquatics coordinator at a YMCA in Florida. Her fiancé, Brett Gorman, a former investment manager, was paid a salary that amounted to more than $500,000 a year for duties that included putting out a daily newsletter called “Blizzy Ranch Daily News,” according to people familiar with this role and notes viewed by the Journal.</p><p>  Hsieh先生的核心团队还包括Elizabeth Pezzello，他们在佛罗里达州的YMCA曾担任过水上协调员。她的FiancéBrettGorman是一名前投资经理Brett Gorman，薪资超过50万美元的薪酬，包括推出每日通讯称为“Blizzy Ranch Dayme News”的职责，根据熟悉此作用和票据查看由期刊。</p><p>  One string of green sticky notes named “Tony’s staff [whose] happiness depends on him.” The list included Ms. Baleson, Andy Hsieh and Ms. Pezzello.</p><p>  一串名为“Tony的员工[谁]幸福取决于他的一串绿色粘性笔记。”该清单包括Baleson女士，安迪Hsieh和Pezzello女士。</p><p>  Mimi Pham, Mr. Hsieh’s longtime personal assistant, didn’t live in Park City but nonetheless arranged travel and managed contractors for her boss, collecting a commission equal to 10% of the bills, according to a Hsieh estate claim filed by Ms. Pham in Las Vegas and people familiar with the matter.</p><p>  米米PHAM，Hsieh先生的长期个人助理，并没有居住在公园城市，但仍然安排了她的老板的旅行和管理承包商，根据PHAM女士提出的HSIEH Estate索赔，收集等于票据的佣金等于票据的佣金在拉斯维加斯和熟悉此事的人。</p><p>    Rachael Brown, a former Zappos executive and longtime companion, didn’t play a large role in Mr. Hsieh’s business plans but was often by his side, bringing him nitrous oxide, according to people who were there.</p><p>    雷哈勒布朗，前Zappos Executive和Longtime Companion，并没有在Hsieh先生的商业计划中发挥巨大作用，但据在那里的人，据他人说，据他人们常常在他身边。</p><p>  Tony Hsieh was using the gas soon after leaving rehab. Nitrous oxide, usually associated with medical procedures, is sold commercially in small canisters typically used in restaurants for whipped-cream dispensers. It triggers varying degrees of euphoria, confusion and slurred speech and, longer term, can cause brain damage. The gas grew popular at raves and music festivals, where fans inhale lungfuls from balloons for an intense minuteslong high.</p><p>  托尼Hsieh在离开康复后很快就使用了气体。通常与医疗程序相关的一氧化物，商业上市的小罐在通常用于餐馆的奶油分配器中。它触发了不同程度的兴奋，混乱和糖类言论，延长术语，可能导致脑损伤。气体在狂欢和音乐节中流行，风扇从气球中吸入龙，以强烈的克隆。</p><p>  Mr. Hsieh also consumed alcohol and other drugs. He ate psychedelic mushrooms during a group bus trip to a ranch in Montana last June and had what friends described as a psychotic break, shouting and pacing the aisles. Later that month, Mr. Hsieh was high on mushrooms at one of his Park City houses and began wrecking the furnishings, in a rampage that trapped two women inside.</p><p>  Hsieh先生也消耗了酒精和其他药物。他去年6月在蒙大拿州的一场牧场上吃了迷幻蘑菇，并让朋友被描述为精神病休息，喊叫和搏动过道。那个月晚些时候，Hsieh先生在他的公园城市房屋之一高蘑菇，并开始破坏家具，在困境中困境。 </p><p>  Ms. Baleson helped the two women escape, part of efforts by the group to keep word of Mr. Hsieh’s troubles from reaching media outlets. Another member of the group persuaded police officers to take Mr. Hsieh to the hospital, rather than arrest him.</p><p>Baleson女士帮助两名女士逃脱，集团努力保持Hsieh先生从到达媒体网点的烦恼中的一部分。该集团的另一个成员说服警察将Hsieh先生给医院，而不是逮捕他。</p><p>    In August, Mr. Hsieh abruptly stepped down as chief executive at Zappos. That month, after learning about Mr. Hsieh’s hospital stay, his parents, Richard and Judy Hsieh, hired a drug-and-alcohol counselor to stage an intervention with their eldest son. The counselor tried twice to see Mr. Hsieh at the Ranch but each time was turned away at the door.</p><p>    八月，赫伊先生在ZAPPOS的首席执行官突然下降。那个月，在学习Hsieh先生的住院住宿时，他的父母，理查德和朱迪Hsieh，聘请了一种毒品和酒精顾问，以举办与他们的长子的干预。辅导员试过两次才能看到牧场的Hsieh先生，但每次都在门口转过身去。</p><p>  Mr. Hsieh’s parents sent one of his younger brothers, Andy Hsieh, who had earlier worked at Zappos. Tony Hsieh offered his brother $1 million to stay in Park City, and Andy was soon swept up in the group. Andy was assigned to get a “helicopter charter from and to vegas and homestead” and “met with tequila suppliers,” according to work schedules. He also stored canisters of nitrous oxide in his room, according to photos and people familiar with the matter.</p><p>  Hsieh先生的父母派出了他的弟弟和早些时候在Zappos工作的兄弟之一。 Tony Hsieh为他的兄弟100万美元留在公园城市，而安迪很快就会在集团中席卷。 Andy被分配为获得“从拉斯维加斯和宅基地和宅基地的直升机宪章”，并“与龙舌兰供应商相遇，”根据工作时间表。根据照片和熟悉此事的人，他还在他的房间里储存了氧化亚氧化亚氮的罐。</p><p>  The singer-songwriter Jewel, one of Mr. Hsieh’s longtime friends, played a private concert in mid-August at the Ranch in which she mentioned her Inspiring Children Foundation, which sponsors education and mental-health programs. She later wrote Mr. Hsieh a two-page letter, saying she was worried about his drug use and didn’t believe the people around him were looking after his best interests. Parts of the  letter were first reported by the business magazine Forbes.</p><p>  Hsieh先生的长期朋友之一，歌手-Songriter珠宝首饰，在8月中旬在牧场举行了私人音乐会，她提到了她提到鼓舞人心的儿童基金会，这赞助教育和心理健康计划。她后来写了一个双页的信，说她担心他的吸毒，并不相信他周围的人正在照顾他的最佳利益。商业杂志福布斯首次报道了这封信的部分。</p><p>  “You need to ask yourself one question: do you want to die this year or next—are you done helping the world?” she wrote. “I say this with love, and as possibly the only person in your circle not on your payroll.”</p><p>  “你需要问问自己一个问题：你想在今年或下一个人死去吗？你完成了帮助世界吗？”她写了。 “我用爱说这个，也可能是你圈子中唯一的人没有你的薪水。”</p><p>  The letter ended up displayed inside Mr. Hsieh’s mansion and surrounded with comments written on sticky notes that appeared to mock Jewel’s concern.</p><p>  这封信最终显示在Hsieh先生的豪宅里面，并包围着写在粘性笔记上的评论，这些评论似乎嘲笑了Jewel的担忧。</p><p>  “I feel compelled to write,” one sticky note said, quoting from the letter.</p><p>  “我觉得被迫写作，”一张粘滞说，从信中引用。 </p><p>    Mr. Hsieh told people he was doing fine, and he viewed as a betrayal any move to restrain his behavior. He had stopped speaking to at least one friend involved in getting him to the Park City rehabilitation clinic. He used a rating system, tallied on sticky notes, that showed his team who was in his favor. No one wanted to fall short.</p><p>Hsieh先生告诉人们，他做得很好，他被认为是一种背叛，以抑制他的行为。他已经停止发表谈到至少一位参与让他参与公园城市康复诊所的朋友。他使用了一个评级系统，在粘滞便笺上讲，展示了他的团队谁掌握了他的青睐。没有人想摔倒。</p><p>  Some group members tried to help in ways they believed Mr. Hsieh would tolerate. One plan was hiring the on-call doctor.
