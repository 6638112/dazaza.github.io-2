The sky was blue, no clouds in sight, and the temperature in Dallas that day had hit 70 degrees. He needed this deep breath at the end of another long work day.</p><p>两周前，布拉德利Crenshaw挖掘了家庭板块，观看他的女儿＆＃39;高中垒球比赛。天空是蓝色的，在视线中没有云，那天的达拉斯的温度达到了70度。他在另一个长工作日结束时需要这种深呼吸。</p><p> Crenshaw has a hectic job as the owner of Dallas Card Investors, a company that serves as a valuable middleman between collectors and the big card-grading services. Most of his clients are large collectors and dealers, though he does have some moms, dads and kids all asking if his company thinks it&#39;s worth paying $100-plus per card to have an official grader put their cards under the microscope. Crenshaw advises his clients yea or nay on whether it&#39;s worth jumping to the next level in the grading process, then either sends the cards back to the submitter or forwards to a big grader. Because he can bundle large lots, he often gets a better rate for customers who decide to go for a final grade.</p><p> Crenshaw作为达拉斯卡投资者的拥有者，这是一家达拉斯卡投资者的所有者，这是一家用于收集者和大牌等级服务之间有价值的中间人的公司。他的大多数客户都是大型收藏家和经销商，虽然他确实有一些妈妈，爸爸和孩子们都要问他的公司是否认为每张官方的官方成绩在显微镜下的官方成绩给他们的卡片。 CRENSHAW为其客户提供了YEA或NAY，无论是＆＃39; S值得跳转到分级过程中的一个级别，那么要么将卡发送回给提交者或转发到一个大年级学生。因为他可以捆绑很多，因为他经常为决定去最终成绩的客户获得更好的速度。</p><p> Crenshaw&#39;s company has a 96% accuracy rate on predicting what Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA) would grade a card. It&#39;s a little like if you had a new food or drug product and could hire an expert who could almost guarantee what the FDA is going to say about it.</p><p> CRENSHAW＆＃39;公司有96％的准确率，准确率预测专业体育验证者（PSA）将为一张牌级载。它＆＃39;有点像你有新的食物或药品，可以雇用一个专家，他们几乎可以保证FDA会对它的说法。</p><p> The memorabilia business is in the middle of a gold rush right now, with an official grade from the industry&#39;s preeminent grader, PSA Authentication and Grading Services, acting as the cost of admission in the big leagues of card collecting. There are headlines almost every day for the past six months with another record-breaking card sale, and most often involve a card graded by PSA.</p><p> 纪念品业务现在正处于淘金的匆忙中间，官方成绩与业内官方成绩，PSA认证和评分服务，作为卡片大联盟的录取成本。在过去的六个月内，几乎每天都有头条新闻，并在另一个录制的卡片销售中，最常常涉及PSA分级的卡。</p><p> Crenshaw had just begun to settle in alongside his wife when his daughter, the team&#39;s leadoff hitter and center fielder, came to the plate in the third inning.</p><p> 当他的女儿，团队＆＃39; S leadoff击球手和中心领导人，Crenshaw刚刚开始安顿在他的妻子旁边。</p><p> Just then, his phone buzzed. He took a quick look and couldn&#39;t believe it was a real text. The calendar said it was March 30, so perhaps this was some sort of pre-April Fool&#39;s Day prank?</p><p> 那么，他的手机嗡嗡作响。他快速看起来并不能相信这是一个真正的文本。日历说这是3月30日，所以也许这是某种前4月前傻瓜＆＃39;周日恶作剧？</p><p> One of his biggest clients was saying that PSA had suspended the bulk of its services because the company was overwhelmed. Reports were saying that just a few weeks after raising rates per card, the company had mounds of cards to look at and not enough employees to do the job. Up to 10 million cards, the prized possessions of tens of thousands of collectors, were sitting in PSA regional offices across the country, ungraded. In the collecting world, it was the equivalent of the Postal Service announcing on Dec. 15 that demand was too high and the company couldn&#39;t deal with all of its recent holiday package dropoffs.</p><p> 他最大的一位客户之一说PSA暂停了其服务的大部分，因为该公司被淹没了。报告说，只需几周后筹集每张卡率，该公司占据了山丘，以查看，而不是足够的员工进行工作。高达1000万张卡，数万收藏家的珍贵财产，坐在全国各地的PSA区域办事处，未来。在收集世界中，相当于12月15日宣布的邮政服务。需求过高，公司无法处理其最近的所有假期套餐堕落。 </p><p> The softball game went on, but Crenshaw&#39;s mind was elsewhere. The texts and emails poured in, 50 by the end of the game, panicked clients and colleagues wondering how the industry could proceed with PSA sitting out for months.</p><p>垒球比赛继续，但Crenshaw＆＃39;我们的思想在其他地方。在游戏结束时，50次浇注的文本和电子邮件，恐慌的客户和同事们想知道该行业如何与坐在几个月的PSA。</p><p> &#34;My face went down to my phone. I&#39;m texting and emailing, trying to figure out a solution,&#34; Crenshaw said. &#34;If my daughter came up to bat, I would watch. Or if the ball was hit her way, my wife would hit me to let me know the ball was going to her in center field.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我的脸上到了我的手机。我发短信和通过电子邮件，试图找出解决方案，＆＃34; Crenshaw说。 ＆＃34;如果我的女儿来到蝙蝠，我会看。或者如果球被击中她的方式，我的妻子会打电话给我，让我知道球在中央领域会去她。＆＃34;</p><p> Over the next 24 hours, Crenshaw says he received 200-300 total messages.  What was going to happen now? How would their cards get graded? Would they get their cards back? Refunds?</p><p> 在接下来的24小时内，Crenshaw表示他收到了200-300个总信息。现在发生了什么事？他们的牌怎么会被评分？他们会回来的卡吗？退款？</p><p>   FOUNDED IN 1991, PSA had grown to averaging more than 3 million graded cards per year and was the unquestioned gold standard for the majority of collectors. Having a card encased with a PSA grade, on the company&#39;s 1-10 scale, is often an incredible multiplier for the value of an individual card. An ungraded card with a market value of, say, $25,000 in mint condition can get a 10 from PSA and vault as much as 10 times. It&#39;s the hobby&#39;s ultimate thumbs-up -- or down.</p><p>   PSA成立于1991年，每年均增长以平均超过300万张等级的卡片，是大多数收藏家的无责任金标准。在公司＆＃39; S 1-10比例上用PSA等级包装了一张卡片，通常是单独卡的价值的令人难以置信的倍增器。一个未成本的卡片，具有市场价值的薄荷条件的25,000美元可以从PSA和Vault获得10次。它＆＃39;是爱好＆＃39;终极竖起大拇指 - 或向下。</p><p> But the card boom had made the current growth unsustainable. PSA was receiving 500,000 cards every five days, which was more than the company took in every three months before the COVID-19 pandemic started. The number of packages received per month rose from under 18,000 this past November to nearly 30,000 in February, and it eventually caused the system to buckle. In its statement, PSA said the company had grown from 421 employees in January 2020 to 783 this March, still not nearly enough for the surge that has happened over the past 12 months. PSA did not respond to an ESPN request for comment.</p><p> 但卡繁荣使目前的增长不可持续。 PSA每五天收到500,000张牌，这比公司在Covid-19大流行开始前每三个月一次。每月收到的包装数量从11月18,000岁以下的18,000人在2月份到近30,000人，最终导致系统扣。在其声明中，PSA表示，该公司于2020年1月从421名员工增长至783年3月，这仍然对过去12个月发生的激增仍然没有足够的浪涌。 PSA没有回复ESPN评论请求。</p><p> &#34;Given our growing backlog, it would be disingenuous for us to continue to accept submissions for cards that we will be unable to process in the foreseeable future,&#34; PSA president Steve Sloan said in the letter. &#34;It&#39;s an unpleasant conclusion, especially after the March 1 price increase, but it is necessary to properly serve the customers who have already submitted to PSA.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;鉴于我们的日益增长，我们将不愿意继续接受我们将无法在可预见的未来处理的卡片提交，＆＃34; PSA总裁史蒂夫斯斯洛安在这封信中说。 ＆＃34;它的一个令人不快的结论，特别是在3月1日的价格上涨后，有必要适当地为已经提交给PSA的客户。＆＃34;</p><p>  That decision to suspend some of its services will not just impact PSA, but a majority of the ecosystem that has formed within the sports card hobby also will feel the ripple effect in the short term.</p><p>  暂停其一些服务的决定不仅仅影响PSA，而且在体育卡爱好中形成的大部分生态系统也会感受到短期内的涟漪效应。 </p><p> &#34;At least 75% of the cards we sell are graded by PSA,&#34; said Rick Probstein, whose auction house has sold more than $120 million of cards on eBay over the past two years. &#34;It&#39;s like Coca-Cola telling people to go drink Pepsi for a few months.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34;我们销售的至少75％的卡片由PSA分级，＆＃34; Rick Probstein表示，过去两年拍卖房屋在eBay上销售了超过1.2亿美元的牌。 ＆＃34;它和＃39;像可口可乐告诉人们喝百事可乐几个月。＆＃34;</p><p> At Crenshaw&#39;s company, if his graders believe a card falls below a 9 or 10, the client can determine if they would still like to get the card graded. Since value is partially determined by condition, it could end up costing someone more to submit the card if it comes back graded lower than a 9. Crenshaw charges $5 to review each card and receives a discounted price through the grading services, thus saving his clients from unnecessary submission and processing fees.</p><p> 在Crenshaw＆＃39; S公司，如果他的年级家认为一张卡落在9或10以下，客户可以确定他们是否仍然希望获得碎片。由于价值按条件部分确定，它最终可能会使某人更加成本，如果它恢复低于9. Crenshaw费用5美元，以便通过分级服务审查每张卡并通过评分服务获得折扣价格，以便拯救他的客户从不必要的提交和处理费用。</p><p> &#34;As far as submissions we take in on a monthly basis, it&#39;s thousands,&#34; Crenshaw said. &#34;We average between $45,000 and $50,000 a month just in grading fees. That&#39;s total to all of the companies. A lot of our stuff, up until the shut-off, we had shifted and done about 95% of our business with PSA.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;就提交的提交，我们每月服用，它＆＃39;千分之一，＆＃34; Crenshaw说。 ＆＃34;我们平均每月45,000至50,000美元，就在分级费。 ＆＃39;总计所有公司。我们的很多东西，直到关闭，我们已经转移并完成了大约95％的业务与PSA。＆＃34;</p><p> With the temporary suspension, Crenshaw and his clients now have a choice to make: Either they wait until PSA opens back up because they value that grade more than the others, or they choose a different service.</p><p> 随着临时暂停，CRENSHAW和他的客户现在可以选择：他们等到PSA打开备份，因为它们的价值比其他等级更多，或者他们选择不同的服务。</p><p> &#34;My hot take is that ... it&#39;s a good thing?&#34; says Gary Vaynerchuk, CEO of VaynerMedia and sports card mogul. &#34;I thought, &#39;It&#39;ll be good for them to catch up,&#39; followed by, &#39;I wonder what SGC (Sportscard Guaranty Corporation) and Beckett and the new players are going to do.&#39; It&#39;s a huge opportunity for them.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我热的拍摄就是......它＆＃39;是一件好事？＆＃34; Gaynermedia和Sports Card Mogul的Cary Vaynerchuk表示Gary Vaynerchuk。 ＆＃34;我想，＆＃39;它＆＃39; ll为他们赶上，＆＃39;其次是，＆＃39;我想知道SGC（SportScard担保公司）和贝克特和新玩家将要做什么。＆＃39;它＆＃39;这是他们的巨大机会。＆＃34;</p><p> It&#39;s not all bad for Crenshaw&#39;s company and clients, as they are also part of the backlog currently held up at PSA. Crenshaw estimates he has hundreds of thousands of cards waiting to be graded.</p><p> 它并非所有糟糕的Crenshaw＆＃39;公司和客户，因为它们也是目前在PSA举行的积压的一部分。 Crenshaw估计他有数百张牌等待被评级。</p><p> The bright side to PSA&#39;s suspension is that the thousands of cards sitting in bins at the company&#39;s facility might actually be graded sooner than had the company not shut down. By stopping the inflow, PSA will be able to focus on the backlog and return the cards to its customers with shiny new grades. The collectors who plan on adding the cards to their current set and keeping them for themselves have only experienced annoyance having to wait longer than usual to get a card graded.</p><p> PSA＆＃39; S Supenting的明亮一侧是，坐在公司坐在公司的数千张卡片＆＃39; S的设施实际上可能比公司未关闭的速度更快。通过停止流入，PSA将能够专注于积压并用闪亮的新成绩将卡返回给客户。计划将卡添加到当前集合并保持其自身的集体员只有经验丰富的烦恼，不得不等待比平常更长时间。 </p><p> Not everyone will have that luxury, however, because not everyone in the hobby is collecting. Because sales have gone through the roof, there are plenty of people earning an income through flipping cards.</p><p>然而，不是每个人都会有这种奢侈品，因为不是爱好的每个人都在收集。因为销售经历了屋顶，所以有很多人通过翻转卡获得收入。</p><p> Shawn Henry is one of Crenshaw&#39;s clients and is a collector as well as a seller. He collected as a child, but only recently got back into the hobby after attending a wedding about a year and a half ago. A friend at the wedding had shown him a picture of his Prizm  Luka Doncic rookie card on his phone and told him his find was now worth thousands more than he bought it for.</p><p> 肖恩亨利是Crenshaw＆＃39;客户之一，是收藏家和卖家。他作为一个孩子收集，但最近在参加一年半前的婚礼后才能回到爱好。婚礼上的朋友向他展示了他的Prizm Luka Doncic Rookie卡在手机上的照片，告诉他他的发现现在比他买的更多价值。</p><p>  After that conversation, Henry found a retail box of 2018-2019 Prizm basketball cards for $2,000 and happened to pull a Doncic card of his own. He flipped it for $8,800 and was hooked.</p><p>  在这次谈话之后，亨利发现了一箱2018-2019普里扎姆篮球卡，以2,000美元，并恰好地拉出了自己的唐科卡。他以8,800美元的价格翻转它，并被迷上了。</p><p> Henry figures he has 180 of his own cards that have been sitting at PSA waiting for a grade, some for more than a year, that have cost approximately $11,000 in grading fees alone. With a skyrocketing market in full swing right now, Henry has no idea how much money he&#39;ll miss out on by his cards sitting in collector purgatory.</p><p> 亨利人物他拥有180张自己的卡片，这已经坐在PSA等待着一年级，有些超过一年，这是每单位的分级费用约为11,000美元。亨利立即举行了一场暴涨市场，不知道他和＃39; LL坐在收藏家炼狱中的卡片错过了多少钱。</p><p> &#34;It&#39;s frustrating because the markets are always swinging and you have to time them right. So when PSA is off, you&#39;re losing money,&#34; Henry said. &#34;It&#39;s unfortunate because they&#39;re a business and they&#39;re holding up other peoples&#39; business and staggering the market. If their timeline was up to date, the market would be so much healthier than it is right now, and that&#39;s hard to believe.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;它＆＃39;令人沮丧，因为市场总是摆动，你必须对他们来说。所以当PSA关闭时，你＆＃39;重新亏损，＆＃34;亨利说。 ＆＃34;它＆＃39; s不幸的，因为他们＆＃39;重新举起一个商业和他们＆＃39;重新举起其他人和＃39;业务和令人震惊的市场。如果他们的时间表是最新的，市场将比现在更健康，而且很难相信。＆＃34;</p><p> Henry estimates he has well over $1 million in total value for the cards he has waiting at PSA. He wouldn&#39;t have sold all of those cards right away and would have kept some for his collection. But because the market fluctuates, he figures he has lost $100,000 from his cards being held at PSA. Most of that comes from basketball cards,  Zion Williamson and  Ja Morant cards in particular. Henry notes that Morant cards were initially hot but have since cooled, and he wouldn&#39;t be able to sell the cards for nearly as much as he would have had he gotten them back sooner.</p><p> 亨利估计他在PSA等待的卡片的总价值超过100万美元。他将立即销售所有这些卡片，并将一些牌销售给他的收藏品。但由于市场波动，他的数据，他的牌丢失了100,000美元的卡在PSA。其中大部分来自篮球卡，锡安威廉姆斯和ja morant卡。亨利指出，莫雷卡牌最初是炎热但被冷却的炎热，而且他将能够销售卡片几乎就像他迟早回来一样。</p><p> Having a graded card instead of the raw version gives those resellers an opportunity to make a profit. Waiting until PSA reopens probably is not an option for those looking to keep their income steadily flowing, as this is all a cash game.</p><p> 拥有分级卡而不是原始版本使这些经销商有机会获得利润。等待PSA重新打开可能不是那些希望保持其收入稳步流动的人的选择，因为这是一项现金游戏。 </p><p> Not every card is worth enough to have that type of disparity in price, but the difference can be dramatic. Take, for example, the 1986 Fleer Michael Jordan rookie, one of the most popular cards in the hobby at the moment. A raw, ungraded version of that card recently sold on eBay for $2,000, where a 9-graded mint version sold on the same day for $52,600. Even on the lower end, if someone is reselling cards, the difference between ungraded and graded could be making a profit or netting a loss.</p><p>并非每张卡都足以让那种类型的差异价格，但差异可能是戏剧性的。例如，采取1986年瑞士·迈克尔乔丹新秀，目前最受欢迎的牌之一。该卡的原始，未成本的版本最近在eBay上销售了2,000美元，其中9分级的薄荷版在同一天出售，以52,600美元。即使在下端，如果有人正在转售卡，尚未获得和评级之间的差异可能会赚取损失或净损失。</p><p> &#34;I mean, everything depends on [grading],&#34; Probstein said. &#34;The difference between a 9 and a 10 could be a million dollars. It&#39;s also a powerful position, too. It&#39;s the lifeblood. Everything we do is based off it.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我的意思是，一切都取决于[分级]，＆＃34; Probstein说。 ＆＃34; 9和10之间的差异可能是一百万美元。它也是一个强大的位置。它＆＃39;生命博弈。我们所做的一切都是基于它。＆＃34;</p><p>  MANY INSIDERS raised a surprising point when discussing the PSA shutdown: Perhaps it could be a good thing long term to not have one grading service be so powerful. Despite the immediate negative impact for the first part of 2021, some believe it&#39;s actually important for the hobby not to be so reliant on just PSA.</p><p>  许多内部人士在讨论PSA关闭时提出了一个令人惊讶的点：也许这可能是一件好事，没有一个等级的服务如此强大。尽管2021年的第一部分立即产生了负面影响，但有些人认为它＆＃39实际上对于幸存者来说，它实际上很重要。</p><p> Jesse Craig, director of business development for PWCC auctions, said it was a smart decision because of the sheer volume PSA has taken in. PWCC is an online marketplace and auction house that regularly features some of the hobby&#39;s high-end cards. The company sold 15 cards for a little under $1 million in one of its recent auctions alone and has a Class III bank vault to securely store cards and collectibles for their clients.</p><p> PWCC拍卖会的业务发展总监Jesse Craig表示，这是一个聪明的决定，因为纯粹的卷已经采取了。PWCC是一个在线市场和拍卖所经常拥有一些业余爱好＆＃39;高端卡。该公司仅在最近拍卖中销售了15张以上的100万张牌，并拥有III级银行金库，为客户提供安全地存储卡和收藏品。</p><p> Craig doesn&#39;t believe PSA would have been able to get caught up without making drastic changes to scale or suspending submissions. Now collectors are forced to explore other options for grading services.</p><p> Craig不相信PSA将能够陷入困境或暂停提交的剧烈变化，以便陷入困境。现在收集者被迫探索评分服务的其他选择。</p><p> &#34;It can turn into one of two things, where people are just waiting to send to PSA until they&#39;re back up and running, or they decide to use Beckett or SGC,&#34; Craig said. &#34;But that could bog down those two grading companies and it could really open the door for a couple new grading companies like CSG (Certified Sports Guaranty).&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;它可以变成两件事之一，人们只是在等待发送到PSA，直到他们＆＃39;重新恢复和运行，或者他们决定使用Beckett或SGC，＆＃34;克雷格说。 ＆＃34;但这可能会使这两个等级的公司陷入困境，它可以真正为CSG（认证体育担保）等新分级公司开门。＆＃34;</p><p> Beckett and SGC, PSA&#39;s two biggest competitors, are already experiencing a backlog of their own. Not to the level PSA is, but enough for the companies to increase pricing in hopes of lowering the volume that&#39;s coming in.</p><p> Beckett和SGC，PSA＆＃39; S两个最大的竞争对手，已经遇到了他们自己的积压。不要对PSA级是，但足以为公司提高定价，希望降低＆＃39的卷。 </p><p> Even so, Beckett president Jeromy Murray is open about what would be another shocking development: He fears his company will have to shut down to catch up, too. It used to offer a money-back guarantee on submissions if they took too long; five years ago the demand got so high that stopped.</p><p>即便如此，Beckett总裁Jeromy Murray开放了另一个令人震惊的发展：他担心他的公司将不得不关闭以赶上。如果他们花了太久，它习惯于提交的退款保证;五年前，需求达到如此之高。</p><p> &#34;I would love to stay away from [a shutdown]. Ideally, we would love to be caught up with this backlog, but the demand is so high,&#34; Murray says. &#34;Our standard service right now has ballooned to six to nine months. So, could it happen to us? Oh yeah, absolutely. We want to avoid that if at all possible.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我很乐意远离[关机]。理想情况下，我们很乐意赶上这个积压，但需求是如此之高，＆＃34;默里说。 ＆＃34;我们的标准服务现在已经膨胀至六到九个月。所以，它可能会发生在我们身上吗？哦，是的，绝对。我们希望避免这种情况。＆＃34;</p><p> But as Craig said, this increase in demand is opening the door for new companies and new methods. CSG is under the umbrella of the Certified Collectibles Group, which has been grading comic books and currency since 1987. The company saw an opportunity in the sports card market and created the CSG branch in February. Because the company was so highly respected in the comic industry, CSG immediately had sports card submissions for grading from existing comic clients.</p><p> 但正如克雷格所说，这种需求增加正在为新公司和新方法打开门。 CSG在1987年以来一直是经认证的收藏品集团的魔法丛书和货币。该公司在体育卡市场中看到了机会，并于2月份创建了CSG分支机构。由于该公司在漫画行业如此备受推崇，因此CSG立即掌握了现有漫画客户的分级。</p><p> Max Spiegel, president of Certified Collectibles Group, said the company didn&#39;t know PSA was planning to suspend its services when it launched CSG, but it has been at the ready for the potential impact.</p><p> Certified Collegibles Group总裁Max Spiegel表示，该公司不知道PSA计划在推出CSG时暂停其服务，但它已准备好潜在的影响。</p><p> &#34;I don&#39;t see a scenario where our competitor can shut off submissions to a large category of cards and for that not to benefit us,&#34; Spiegel said. &#34;It&#39;s hard to quantify that benefit, and maybe we&#39;re not seeing it immediately because it hasn&#39;t trickled down to us yet, but it definitely won&#39;t hurt. It can only help us.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我没有看到我们的竞争对手可以关闭提交给大类卡的情况，并为此没有让我们受益，＆＃34; Spiegel说。 ＆＃34;它难以量化那种好处，也许我们＆＃39;重新看到它，因为它陷入困境，但它绝对赢了＆＃39; t受伤。它只能帮助我们。＆＃34;</p><p> Crenshaw has already opened a new business account with CSG and just submitted his first bulk submission to the company because of the opportunity to get cards back in a timely manner.</p><p> Crenshaw已经开设了一个新的商业账户，刚刚向公司提交了第一个批量提交，因为有机会及时获取卡片。</p><p> CSG is well aware that it needs to be careful not to follow in the footsteps of its competitors and create a backlog of its own. It needs to balance that notion with the fact it also needs to persuade new customers to trust it with their grading and that cards graded by CSG can hold similar value to a PSA-graded card. &#34;In order for CSG to get on the map, they&#39;re going to need to get some big cards at auction,&#34; Henry said. &#34;They&#39;re going to need to get big money with their name on it. Their name needs to be seen in these auctions, keep their timelines to what they say they&#39;re going to be, and if they can do that, and PSA doesn&#39;t open up, they could see a lot of success.&#34;</p><p> CSG很清楚，它需要注意不要在竞争对手的脚步上遵循并创建自己的积压。它需要平衡这一事实的概念，它还需要说服新客户与分级相信它，并且CSG分级的卡片可以将类似的值与PSA分级卡保持相似。 ＆＃34;为了让CSG获取地图，他们＆＃39;重新需要在拍卖会上获得一些大牌，＆＃34;亨利说。 ＆＃34;他们＆＃39;重新需要用他们的名字获得大笔资金。他们的名字需要在这些拍卖中看到，将他们的时间表保持在他们所说的那样;重新成为他们，如果他们能够做到这一点，而且PSA没有开放，他们可以看到很多成功。＆＃34; </p><p> Part of the issue is that card graders aren&#39;t just falling out of the sky or lining up in droves at the doorstep of these companies to help with the volume issue. It can be a grueling job; sitting at a desk, staring at sports cards you don&#39;t own for over eight hours a day can be a grind.</p><p>部分问题是卡片平分机场＆＃39; T只是掉下来的天空或在这些公司的门口的拖车中排队，以帮助批量问题。这可能是一个艰苦的工作;坐在一张桌子，盯着运动卡，你不拥有8小时超过八个小时可以是一个研磨。</p><p>  Not only is it a challenge to find and train graders, it can sometimes be difficult to retain them as well. Graders get such an up close, intimate look at the hobby that they have knowledge that can be used to make more money than what the card-grading services can offer. If they were to start a pre-grading service similar to what Crenshaw has, or even sell cards on their own, they could stand to make more than what they would as a card grader for PSA or any other service.</p><p>  不仅要找到和培训学生的挑战，它有时也很难保留它们。学生获得了如此紧密，亲密地看着他们拥有的业余爱好，可以用来赚钱而不是卡片评分服务可以提供的资金。如果他们要开始预分级的服务，类似于Crenshaw拥有的，甚至自己卖卡，他们可能会掌握超过他们作为PSA或任何其他服务的卡片学生。</p><p> The conversation has also fueled speculation about a more radical solution to the grading problem: Maybe the robots can save the day? There have been long-running conversations in the business about how AI grading could one day be more objective and cheaper than humans evaluating cards. It&#39;s hard to get around the math of grading 100,000-plus cards per day with humans alone.</p><p> 谈话还推动了对分级问题的更激进的解决方案的猜测：也许机器人可以挽救这一天？在业务中有长期运行的对话，关于AI分级有一天如何更客观，比人类评估卡更便宜。它难以绕过每天用人类分级100,000加卡的数学数学。</p><p> &#34;Are we ready for artificial intelligence grading?&#34; Probstein asks. &#34;That&#39;s a whole other can of worms. How do you take eye appeal out of the equation? That&#39;s a very big bungee jump. I don&#39;t know if the industry is ready for that.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我们为人工智能分级准备好吗？＆＃34;丙斯坦问道。 ＆＃34;这是一个蠕虫的整个罐头。你如何从等式中取出眼睛呼吸？那个非常大的蹦极跳跃。我不知道这个行业是否已准备好。＆＃34; </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/31244566/hobby-searches-answers-psa-grading-services-halts-card-submissions">https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/31244566/hobby-searches-answers-psa-grading-services-halts-card-submissions</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/分级/">#分级</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/card/">#card</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/psa/">#psa</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
