How many more names are forgotten?</p><p>Jerry Lawson LED墨盒发明，ED史密斯制作了一个混合动力控制台/ PC，设计师Muriel Tramis赢得了法国最高荣誉，使历史成为历史。遗忘了多少名字？</p><p>   I n the 1970s, in the fledgling days of the video games industry, an engineer named Gerald “Jerry” Lawson designed one of the earliest game consoles, the Channel F, and also led the team that invented the game cartridge, a defining innovation in how games were made and sold. His son, Andersen Lawson, recalls that he was often working on gaming projects in the garage of their family home in Santa Clara, California. “There have been conversations recently about the struggles he might have had that were related to his colour,” he says. “Was it difficult [for him]? Yes, I’m quite certain. But I never heard any grumblings from him. And I’m also certain that he earned his respect … My father was a person of colour and I think that would inspire young people today to jump in and help move the industry along.”</p><p>   我在20世纪70年代，在视频游戏行业的漂浮日，一位名叫杰拉尔德的工程师“杰里”劳动设计了最早的游戏机，频道F，也领导了发明游戏盒的团队，一个定义创新如何制造和销售游戏。他的儿子，安德森·劳森召回他常常在加利福尼亚州圣克拉拉的家庭住宅的车库里努力工作。 “最近有关于他可能已经与他的颜色有关的斗争的对话，”他说。 “对他来说很难]吗？是的，我很肯定。但我从未听过他的任何抱怨。而且我也肯定是他赢得了他的尊重......我的父亲是一个颜色的人，我认为今天会激励年轻人跳进并帮助行业移动。“</p><p> Black people, and especially black women, are still underrepresented in the video games industry. The Independent Game Developers’ Association records that only 2% of US game developers identify as black; in the UK, meanwhile, according to UKIE’s 2020 census of the entire industry, 10% of its workers are black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME). But black innovators such as Jerry Lawson have been present and influential since the earliest days of the video games industry – and there is not enough recognition for their achievements.</p><p> 黑人，尤其是黑人女性，在电子游戏行业仍然强名。独立游戏开发人员的协会记录只有2％的美国游戏开发人员识别为黑色;与此同时，在英国，根据Ukie的2020年人口普查的整个行业，10％的工人是黑色，亚洲和少数民族（BAME）。但是，自从电子游戏行业最早的日子以来，杰瑞·劳森这样的黑人创新者已经存在和有影响力 - 并且对他们的成就并没有足够的认可。</p><p>   Lawson was featured in Netflix’s  High Score documentary series on the history of video games last year. Born in New York in 1940, he developed a strong interest in electronics during his youth, when he often fixed his neighbours’ small appliances as a hobby. This influenced his decision to become an engineer, and after moving to California, he became a member of Silicon Valley’s Homebrew Computer Club, a hobbyist collective that included Apple co-founders  Steve Jobs and  Steve Wozniak among its members. It was his work as an engineer at San Jose-based Fairchild Semiconductor, though, that was truly pioneering. As a side project, he created a coin-op arcade game called Demolition Derby, and as a result he was approached by his bosses to become the lead engineer in the company’s new gaming division. He died from complications of diabetes in 2011, aged 70.</p><p>   劳森在Netflix的高分纪录片系列中是去年视频游戏历史的。 1940年出生于纽约，他在青年期间对电子产品产生了强烈的兴趣，当时他经常将他的邻居的小家电作为一种爱好。这影响了他成为工程师的决定，并且在搬到加利福尼亚后，他成为了硅谷的家用电器俱乐部的成员，这是一个合艾集会，其中包括苹果联合创始人史蒂夫乔布斯和史蒂夫·沃兹尼亚克在其成员之间。然而，它是基于San Jose的Fairchild半导体的工程师的工作，这是真正开创的。作为一个侧面项目，他创造了一个名为Demolition derby的硬币欧瓦德游戏，因此他被他的老板接近了公司的新游戏部门的领导工程师。他从2011年的糖尿病并发症中死亡，年龄70岁。</p><p> After moving on from Fairchild in 1980, Lawson founded Video Soft, which created games for the Atari 2600. The games were never publicly released, however, and following the notorious North American  video game crash of 1983, he shut up shop in 1984 and worked as a consulting engineer thereafter. “Another company had the idea for the console but it was Fairchild that commercialised it,” says Andersen Lawson. “My dad was the person responsible for putting the team together … and they were able to achieve something that has been long since forgotten.”</p><p> 在1980年从Fairchild搬进来之后，Lawson创建了视频软，为Atari 2600创造了游戏。然而，除了1983年的臭名昭着的北美电子游戏崩溃之后，奥运会从未公开发布，他于1984年闭嘴并工作之后是咨询工程师。 “另一家公司对控制台有了这个想法，但它是商业化的飞越，”安德森·劳森说。 “我的父亲是负责将团队放在一起的人......他们能够从忘记以来一直存在的东西。”</p><p>  New York-born Ed Smith, meanwhile, is a retired engineer who helped develop APF Electronics’ Imagination Machine, a hybrid console and home computer system. Companies such as APF expanded into gaming in the 70s and early 80s, providing opportunities for talented engineers. “As a black person, it was more about having the opportunity to be gainfully employed, no matter what area of work I was doing,” Smith tells me. “I had a child at a young age and the biggest thing for me was to get a good job. Luckily, I got into the field of technology and that was the point from which everything else just flowed.”</p><p>  与此同时，纽约出生的Ed Smith是一名退役工程师，帮助开发了APF电子的想象力，一个混合控制台和家用计算机系统。 APF等公司在70年代和80年代初扩展到游戏，为有才能的工程师提供机会。 “作为一个黑人，它更多的是有机会有机会被占用，无论我在做什么工作领域，”史密斯告诉我。 “我在一个年轻的时候有一个孩子，对我来说最大的事情就是得到一份好工作。幸运的是，我进入了技术领域，这是其他一切刚刚流动的重点。“</p><p> I thought our game would be one of many in the marketplace for years to come … the reality is that after the market tanked, I had to go and work in other areas</p><p> 我以为我们的游戏将成为市场上的众多人之一，多年来一直到来......现实是，在市场坦克之后，我不得不去做其他地区 </p><p> As well as engineering, his work on the machine included developing schematic diagrams and game testing. Smith’s innovative work at APF was deeply influential to future generations, but the company itself did not withstand the video game crash. “I thought our game would be one of many in the marketplace for years to come… my expectations were that I would be in the industry for the long term; the reality was that after the market tanked, I had to go and work in other areas,” he says.</p><p>除了工程，他对机器的工作包括开发原理图和游戏测试。史密斯在APF的创新工作对后代的影响深受影响力，但公司本身并没有抵销视频游戏崩溃。 “我认为我们的游戏将成为市场上的许多人之一，多年来......我的期望是我将长期进入行业;现实是，在市场坦克之后，我不得不在其他地区工作，“他说。</p><p> Eventually, Smith found long-term work in tech sales and retired about two years ago to focus on writing Imagine That!, a book about his life. It recounts his struggles as a young black man in 1960s America. “We had our share of things that caused us to go out and to protest at that time. And it was pretty much the same things that we’re dealing with today – which is unfortunate,” he adds.</p><p> 最终，史密斯在科技销售中发现了长期工作，大约两年前退休，专注于写作想象一下！这本书关于他的生命。它将他的斗争叙述了20世纪60年代美国的年轻黑人。 “我们有我们的份额，让我们当时抗议并抗议。这与今天正在处理的事情很多 - 这是不幸的，“他补充道。</p><p>  A third black innovator from the early days of the video games industry is Muriel Tramis, who is considered to be the first black female video game designer. She lives in France but grew up on the  Caribbean island of Martinique, in the Lesser Antilles, and began her career as an engineer, programming military drones. She first made her mark on video games while working at French developer Coktel Vision, which she joined in 1986.</p><p>  来自视频游戏行业早期的第三黑创新者是Muriel Tramis，被认为是第一个黑色女性视频游戏设计师。她住在法国，但在较小的安妥尔斯在较小的安济会上长大，并开始作为工程师的职业生涯，编程军事无人机。她首先在使用法国开发商Coktel Vision的同时在视频游戏中制作了她的标记，她于1986年加入。</p><p> Tramis says that this was her happiest time, professionally speaking. “I had found a way to combine IT and literary creativity,” she told the Guardian. “My editor entrusted me with the project management of his adventure games because my engineering training allowed me to understand the technical aspects of development, programming of interactions, and integration of images and sound. He was of Armenian origin and probably for this reason, was very open-minded to diversity.”</p><p> Tramis说这是她最快乐的时光，专业地说。 “我已经找到了一种方法来结合它和文学创造力，”她告诉守护者。 “我的编辑委托了我的冒险游戏的项目管理，因为我的工程培训允许我了解开发的技术方面，互动的编程以及图像和声音的整合。他是亚美尼亚的起源，可能是因为这个原因，是非常开放的多样性。“</p><p> Méwilo, the 1987 Atari game that Tramis wrote and directed in collaboration with writer Patrick Chamoiseau, drew on Martinique’s rich history. She says: “When I wanted to create my first script, I wanted it to be in the style of a historical novel. It’s natural that I was inspired by the island’s history, because it was unknown, or poorly known, to the rest of the world and had all the ingredients to create intrigue, drama and mystery. The history of the Antilles is part of the history of France, but this region has known the pain of slavery and colonisation. This is the origin of many traumas which are visible in Creole society and mixed societies in general.”</p><p> 1987年，Tramis的1987年Atari Game与作家帕特里克·夏洛维（Raditer Patrick Chamoiseau）合作，绘制了Martinique的丰富历史。她说：“当我想创建我的第一个脚本时，我希望它符合历史小说的风格。我是自然的，我受到了岛上的历史，因为它是未知的，或者众所周知，到世界其他地方，并拥有所有的成分，以创造阴谋，戏剧和神秘。安提斯的历史是法国历史的一部分，但该地区已知奴隶制和殖民化的痛苦。这是许多创伤的起源，这在克里奥尔社会和混合社会中都是可见的。“</p><p> Tramis left Coktel Vision in 2003, but thinks fondly of her time there. “I liked the period so much that after a detour through virtual reality applied to urban planning, I am about to create my own video game development studio,” she says. “About 30 years after my first game, I am working on a future story.” Her upcoming game features black heroes and shows how skin-colour prejudice is the origin of present-day discrimination.</p><p> Tramis于2003年左侧录音，但在那里深情地思考她的时间。 “我喜欢这个时期，在通过虚拟现实绕道而行的时候，我即将创建自己的视频游戏开发工作室，”她说。 “我的第一次比赛后约30年，我正在努力做一个未来的故事。”她即将推出的游戏具有黑色英雄，并展示了肤色的偏见如何是当今歧视的起源。</p><p>  She was awarded the Légion d’honneur in 2018 and says it was an honour not just for herself but for her friends, family, her country and the “sisters” across the world, whom she hopes to inspire. Tramis is keen to encourage more women into technology and science, given the skills shortage in Europe: if women represent 50% of digital users, “they must also be 50% of designers, engineers and technicians”.</p><p>  她于2018年被授予Légiond'Honneur，并表示这是一个荣誉，而不是对自己的朋友，家人，乡下人和“姐妹”，她希望激励。鉴于欧洲的技能短缺，鉴于欧洲的技能短缺，Carmis敏锐地鼓励更多的女性：如果女性占数字用户的50％，“他们也必须是设计师，工程师和技术人员的50％”。 </p><p> If women represent 50% of digital users, they must also be 50% of designers, engineers and technicians</p><p>如果女性占数字用户的50％，他们还必须是50％的设计师，工程师和技术人员</p><p> Though names like Lawson, Smith and Tramis do sometimes show up in video game history books, the contributions of many other black people in the fledgling days of the industry have gone entirely uncredited. “It parallels what we know about black women’s participation in the space program,” says TreaAndrea Russworm, an associate professor of English at the University of Massachusetts, who discusses black women’s contribution to games in  her article Replaying Video Game History as a Mixtape of Black Feminist Thought (co-written with fellow black female academic Samantha Blackmon). “The book and film  Hidden Figures has made it very obvious to us now that black women were there, but they weren’t headliners: they weren’t the astronauts, but they were the human computers, the labour force that was essential to the program, and they worked for many years unrecognised.</p><p> 虽然像劳森一样的名字，史密斯和轨道有时会出现在视频游戏历史书中，但许多其他黑人在行业的漂浮日中的贡献完全没有经过了认可。 “它与我们所知道的黑人妇女参与空间计划的知识相似，”马萨诸塞大学英语副教授Treaandrea Russworm说，他讨论了黑人女性对她的文章中的游戏贡献重播视频游戏历史作为黑色的混合片女权主义者思想（与黑人女学术萨曼莎黑岛共同写）。 “这本书和电影隐藏的人物已经让我们对我们来说非常明显，现在是黑人女性在那里，但他们不是总位：他们不是宇航员，但他们是人类的计算机，这是对的劳动力计划，他们的工作多年来无法识别。</p><p> “At the  Strong Museum [the US National Museum of Play], where they have archives on Midway and Atari, you can flip through their company newsletters, and you’ll come across photos of black women … they sometimes have a title or a caption saying who they were. But a lot of times, they don’t.”</p><p> “在强大的博物馆[美国国家博物馆]，他们在中途和Atari上有档案，你可以通过他们的公司通讯翻转，你会遇到黑人女性的照片......他们有时有一个标题或标题说他们是谁。但很多时候，他们没有。“ </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/may/05/gaming-in-colour-uncovering-video-games-black-pioneers">https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/may/05/gaming-in-colour-uncovering-video-games-black-pioneers</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/colour/">#colour</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
