"Update, June 28, 2021: Ars was saddened to learn that the author of this piece, who also used the handle Near in online interactions,  reportedly took their own life over the weekend. We&#39;re republishing this piece today in memory of their towering contributions to the classic gaming emulation community and to Ars. You can also read  their 2011 piece on the quest for accuracy in bsnes development.\n  If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts, please contact  the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255, or  reach out to a similar international hotline. We&#39;d also encourage readers to  donate to the American Federation for Suicide Prevention if they&#39;re so moved.\n   As the lead coder of  bsnes, I&#39;ve been attempting to perfect Super Nintendo emulation  for the past 15 years. We are now at a point where that goal is in sight, but there we face one last challenge: accurate cycle timing of the SNES video processors. Getting that final bit of emulation accuracy will require a community effort that I hope some of you can help with. But first, let me recap how far we&#39;ve come.  Today, SNES emulation is in a very good place. Barring unusual peripherals that are resistant to emulation (such as  a light-sensor based golf club, an  exercise bike, or a dial-up modem  used to place real-money bets on live horse races in Japan), every officially licensed SNES title is fully playable, and no game is known to have any glaring issues.\n SNES emulation has gotten so precise that I&#39;ve even taken to splitting my emulator into two versions:  higan, which focuses on absolute accuracy and hardware documentation; and  bsnes, which focuses on performance, features, and ease of use.\n    So that&#39;s it, right? Kudos on a job well done, thanks for all the fish? Well... not quite.\n Today, we enjoy cycle-level accuracy for nearly every component of the SNES. The sole exception is the PPUs (picture processing units), which are used to generate the video frames sent to your screen. We  mostly know how the PPUs work, but we have to make guesses for some functionality that result in less than total perfection.\n The remaining issues are relatively small ones, in the grand scheme of things. If you&#39;re not interested in the pursuit of one hundred percent faithful emulation perfection for its own sake, I am not going to be able to convince you of the need for improving SNES PPU emulation further. As with any goal in life, the closer we get to perfection, the smaller the returns.\n I can tell you why this is important to  me: it&#39;s my life&#39;s work, and I don&#39;t want to have to say I came  this close to finishing without getting the last piece of it right. I&#39;m getting older, and I won&#39;t be around forever. I want this final piece solved so that I can feel confident in my retirement that the SNES has been faithfully and completely preserved through emulation. No stone was left unturned, no area left unfinished. I want to say that it&#39;s  done.\n If you&#39;re still intrigued, read on for a deep dive into the background of the problem and my proposed solutions.\n    The arrows indicate the direction that the various processors in the SNES can communicate with one another, and the dotted lines represent memory chip connections.\n The key thing to take away right now is to note that the video and audio output are sent directly from the PPU and DSP specifically. That means they function like \u201cblack boxes\u201d where we don\u2019t have any visibility into what happens inside. This will be important later on.\n  Imagine you are emulating a CPU&#39;s &#34;multiply&#34; instruction, which takes two registers (variables), multiplies them together, and produces a result and some flags that represent the status of the result (such as  overflow).\n We could devise a software program that multiplies every possible value from 0 to 255 as both the multiplier and multiplicand. Then we could output both the numeric and flag results of the multiplication. This would produce two 65,536-entry tables.\n    By analyzing these tables, we could determine exactly how and when the CPU results were set certain ways. Then we could modify our emulators so, when running the same test, we produce exactly the same tables at the same times.\n Now let&#39;s say the CPU had 16-bit x 16-bit multiplications. Testing every possible value would generate 4 billion results, which is starting to push what is practical to test in a reasonable amount of time. If the CPU had 32-bit x 32-bit multiplications, it wouldn\u2019t be practical to test all combinations of inputs before the heat death of the universe (with current technology, at least).\n In cases like this, we would have to get more selective with our tests and try to determine exactly when flags might change, when results might overflow, and so forth. Otherwise we&#39;d have tests that would never complete.\n Multiplication is a fairly trivial operation, but this is the general process behind reverse engineering, and it extends to more complex operations such as how the SNES&#39; horizontal blanking DMA (direct memory access) transfers work. We create tests that try to detect what happens on edge cases, then confirm that our emulation behaves identically to a real SNES.\n  The SNES contains two oscillators: a crystal clock that runs at ~21MHz, which controls the CPU and PPUs; and a ceramic resonator that runs at ~24MHz, which controls the SMP and DSP. Cartridge coprocessors will sometimes use the ~21MHz CPU oscillator and sometimes include their own oscillators that run at different frequencies.\n  A clock is the core timing element of any system, and the SNES is designed to perform various tasks at certain frequencies and times.\n If you imagine a 100Hz clock, it is a device with a digital pin that transitions to logic high (+5 volts, for instance), and then back to logic low (0 volts, or ground) 100 times per second. So every second, the pin voltage will fluctuate 200 times total: 100 rising clock edges and 100 falling clock edges.\n A clock cycle is generally treated as one full transition, so a 100Hz clock would generate 100 clock cycles per second. There are some systems that require distinguishing between rising and falling edges, and for those, we break this further down into half-cycles to denote each phase (high or low) of the clock signal.\n The key goal of an authentic emulator is to perform tasks in exactly the same ways and at exactly the same times as the real hardware. It doesn&#39;t much matter specifically  how the tasks are performed. All that matters is that the emulator, when given the same inputs, generates the same outputs with the same timing as real hardware.\n  Sometimes, operations happen over time. Take SNES CPU multiplication, for instance. Rather than pausing to wait for multiplication to complete, the SNES CPU calculates the multiplication result one bit at a time in the background over eight CPU opcode cycles. This allows your code to possibly do other things while waiting on the multiplication to complete.\n Any commercially released software is likely to wait those eight cycles, because if you try to read the result before it&#39;s ready, you will get a partially computed result instead. Yet earlier SNES emulators gave correct results  immediately, without waiting these extra cycles.\n When hobbyists started creating and testing homebrew software via emulators, this discrepancy started to cause some problems. Some of this software, such as many early  Super Mario World ROM hacks, only worked correctly on these earlier emulators, and not on real SNES hardware. That&#39;s because they were designed with the emulator&#39;s immediate (and inauthentic-to-real-hardware) multiplication results in mind.\n As emulators improved, this old software broke, and we have had to subsequently offer compatibility options in our newer emulators in order to not lose this software to time. Yes, as surreal as it is to say, these days our emulators have to emulate other emulators! How meta!\n    The nice thing about the CPU multiplication delay is that it&#39;s very predictable: the eight computation cycles start immediately after requesting a multiplication. By writing code to read the results after every cycle, we were able to confirm that the SNES CPU was using the  Booth  algorithm for multiplication.\n  Other operations are not so simple to model, since they happen asynchronously in the background. The SNES CPU&#39;s DRAM refresh is one such case.\n During the rendering of every scanline, at a certain point, the entire SNES CPU freezes for a short duration as the contents of the RAM chip are refreshed. This is needed because, as a cost-cutting measure, the SNES used dynamic RAM (rather than static RAM) for its main CPU memory. Dynamic RAM must be periodically refreshed in order to preserve its contents over time.\n  The key insight to figuring out the precise timing of these operations was to take advantage of the SNES PPU\u2019s horizontal and vertical counters. These counters advance and are reset after each horizontal and vertical blanking period. However, their precision is only a quarter of the SNES&#39; CPU oscillator frequency; that is to say, the horizontal counter increments only once every four clock cycles.\n By reading the counters multiple times, I was able to determine which quarter of a clock cycle the counter was aligned with. By combining that insight with a specially crafted function that could step by a precise, user-specified number of clock cycles, it became possible to perfectly align the SNES CPU to any exact clock cycle position I wanted.\n By iterating over a range of clock cycles in a loop, I could determine exactly when certain operations (such as DRAM refresh, HDMA transfers, interrupt polling, etc.) would occur, and I was able to reproduce this precisely under emulation.\n The SNES  SMP chip has its own timers as well, and similar reverse engineering was successful against that processor as well. I could spend an entire article talking about the SMP TEST register alone, which allows coders to control the clock divider of the SMP and its timers, among other horrible things. Suffice it to say that, while it was not an easy or fast process, we were ultimately victorious.\n  There were a whole host of SNES coprocessors used inside various game cartridges that needed to be tamed as well. From dedicated general-purpose CPUs like the  SuperFX and  SA-1, to digital signal processors like the DSP-1 and Cx4, to decompression accelerators like the S-DD1 and SPC7110, to real-time clocks from Sharp and Epson, and more...\n That means an SNES emulator needs to be able to handle the instruction and pixel caches of the SuperFX; the memory bus conflict arbitrator of the SA-1 (which allowed the SNES CPU and SA-1 to share the same ROM and RAM chips simultaneously); the embedded firmware of the DSP-1 and Cx4; the prediction-based arithmetic coders of the S-DD1 and SPC7110; and the odd BCD (binary-coded decimal) edge cases of the real-time clocks. Slowly but surely, by applying the above techniques to determine correctness and timing, we were able to near-perfectly emulate all of these chips.\n It actually took a massive effort and thousands of dollars to decap and extract the programming firmware from the digital signal processors used in various games. In one instance, emulation of the NEC uPD772x led to  code from higan being used to save the late professor Stephen Hawking&#39;s voice!\n In another case, we had to reverse-engineer the entire instruction set of the Hitachi HG51B architecture, because this architecture was never publicly documented. In yet another, one game ( Hayazashi Nidan Morita Shougi 2) ended up containing a full-blown 32-bit, 21MHz ARM6 CPU to accelerate its Japanese chess engine!\n Preserving all of the SNES coprocessors alone was a multi-year journey full of challenges and surprises.\n  Not to be confused with the DSP-1 cartridge coprocessor, the Sony S-DSP (digital signal processor) chip is what generated the distinctive sound from the SNES. This chip combined eight voice channels with 4-bit ADPCM encoding to produce a 16-bit stereo signal.\n On the surface, and per the system diagram from earlier, the DSP initially looks like a black box: you configure the voice channels and mixer settings and sit back as it generates sound to be sent to your speakers.\n But one key feature allowed a developer by the name of blargg to fully reverse-engineer this chip: the echo buffer. The SNES DSP has a feature that mixes the outputs from previous samples together to produce an echo effect. This happens at the very end of the audio generation process (aside from one last final mute flag that can be applied to silence all audio output.)\n By writing carefully cycle-timed code and monitoring those echo results, it became possible to discover the exact order of operations the SNES DSP would take to generate each sample and to produce cycle-accurate, bit-perfect audio.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:53:00", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "snes,emulators", "title": "Snes\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u5b8c\u5168\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u51e0\u4e2a\u50cf\u7d20 ", "title_en": "How SNES emulators got a few pixels from complete perfection", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/how-snes-emulators-got-a-few-pixels-from-complete-perfection/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["snes", "emulators"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "2f7755817120e09fbbd082aa669c32bc.png", "infoid": 1068636, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u9ad8\u901a\u516c\u53f8\u5df2\u5ba3\u5e03\u5411Snapdragon 888\u7684\u4e2d\u671f\u66f4\u65b0\uff0cSnapdragon 888 Plus\u3002\u50cf\u5f80\u5e38\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u82af\u7247\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a2\u6708\u4efd\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5148\u524d\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u65f6\u949f\u901f\u7387\u3002\u90a3\u4e9b\u5bfb\u627e\u4e25\u8083\u751a\u81f3\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5347\u7ea7\u7684\u4eba\u5c06\u5931\u671b\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\uff06\uff0334;\u52a0\u4e0a\uff06\uff0334;\u5347\u7ea7\u9ad8\u901a\u516c\u53f8\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u3002\n \u9ad8\u901a\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\uff0cPrime CPU\u6838\u5fc3 - \u82af\u7247\u4e4b\u4e00\uff06\uff0339; S\u516b\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3 - \u73b0\u5728\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f973.0 GHz\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5bf9\u57fa\u7840\u82af\u72472.84 GHz\u76845\uff05\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u5728\u6838\u5fc3\u6838\u5fc3\u4e4b\u540e\uff08\u5904\u7406\u524d\u666f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u4e3b\u8981\u7ebf\u7a0b\u804c\u8d23\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff09\uff0c\u4e09\u4e2a\uff06\uff0334;\u4e2d\u7b49\uff06\uff0334;\u548c\u56db\uff06\uff0334;\u5c0f\uff06\uff0334;\u6838\u5fc3\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002\n \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8fd8\u63d0\u5230\u4e86\u548c\uff0334; AI\u53d1\u52a8\u673a\uff06\uff0334;\u73b0\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u4e8620\uff05\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u8861\u91cf\u6574\u4e2a\u7535\u8bddCPU\uff0cGPU\uff0cDSP\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5904\u7406AI\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5b83\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u6307\u51fa\u90a3\u4e9b\u5df2\u7ecf\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8fd0\u6c14\u5c06\u8fc7\u5ea6\u666e\u904d\u7684ai\u8868\u73b0\u8054\u7cfb\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\n \u8fd9\u662fSnapdragon 888 Plus\u7684\u6574\u4e2a\u66f4\u6539\u7684\u6574\u4e2a\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u53bb\u5e74\uff06\uff0339; S Snapdragon 865\u52a0\u4e0aWi-Fi 6e\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e8610\uff05\u7684CPU\u548cGPU\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u5931\u671b\u3002\u5b83\uff06\uff0339;\u88f8\u9732\u7684\u6700\u4f4e\u9ad8\u901a\u53ef\u4ee5\u505a\u51fa\u8bc1\u660e\u65b0\u7684\u82af\u7247\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u66f4\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\u53ea\u6709\u5c65\u884c\u5bf9\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u627f\u8bfa\u3002\n \u9ad8\u901a\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\u534e\u7855\uff0c\u8363\u8a89\uff0c\u6469\u6258\u7f57\u62c9\uff0c\u4f53\u5185\u548c\u5c0f\u7c73\u88ab\u6392\u961f\u5230\u8239\u8236888\u52a0\u4e0a\u624b\u673a\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5e94\u8be5\u5728Q3\u7684\u67d0\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u51fa\u6765\u3002 ", "note_en": "Qualcomm has announced the mid-cycle update to the  Snapdragon 888, the  Snapdragon 888 Plus. As usual, this is the exact same chip as the previous version that hit the market in February, just with a faster clock rate. Those looking for a serious\u2014or even noticeable\u2014upgrade will be disappointed. This is the smallest &#34;Plus&#34; upgrade Qualcomm has ever done.\n Qualcomm says the Prime CPU core\u2014one of the chip&#39;s eight cores\u2014can now hit 3.0 GHz, which is a five percent improvement over the 2.84 GHz of the base chip. After the Prime core (which handles things like foreground processing and main thread duties), the three &#34;medium&#34; and four &#34;small&#34; cores remain unchanged.\n The company also mentioned that the &#34;AI Engine&#34; is now 20 percent faster. This is a nebulous measurement of how the entire phone\u2014CPU, GPU, DSP, and software\u2014processes AI tasks. It&#39;s not a single concrete object you can point to that has been clocked higher, and good luck tying overhyped AI performance to any actual performance improvements in the real world.\n That&#39;s the entirety of the changes to the Snapdragon 888 Plus. Last year&#39;s  Snapdragon 865 Plus added Wi-Fi 6E support and a 10 percent faster CPU and GPU, so this is a disappointment in comparison.\u00a0It&#39;s the bare minimum Qualcomm could do to justify a new chip release, and this update probably only exists to fulfill roadmap promises made to partners.\n Qualcomm says\u00a0Asus, Honor, Motorola, Vivo, and Xiaomi are lined up to ship Snapdragon 888 Plus phones, which should be out sometime in Q3.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:52:46", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "qualcomm,bare,\u82af\u7247", "title": "Qualcomm\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684Snapdragon 888 Plus SoC\u7684\u6700\u4f4e\u9650\u5ea6 ", "title_en": "Qualcomm does the bare minimum for the new Snapdragon 888 Plus SoC", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/qualcomms-new-snapdragon-888-plus-soc-has-a-new-name-not-much-else/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["qualcomm", "bare", "\u82af\u7247"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "60c8810f7dc88a374262a4c916de7b58.jpg", "infoid": 1068635, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u592a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8Roscosmos\u5728\u5468\u4e00\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u7167\u7247\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5c01\u95ed\u5728\u5176\u6709\u6548\u8f7d\u8377\u6574\u6d41\u7f69\u4e2d\u7684\u4f17\u591aNauka\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ad9\u6a21\u5757\u3002\u8fd9\u5c06\u662f\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\uff06\uff0339;\u5728\u5341\u591a\u4e2a\u5341\u591a\u5e74\u6765\u7684\u56fd\u9645\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ad9\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u8865\u5145\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u4eba\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6a21\u5757\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u3002 \uff06\uff0334;

This will be Russia&#39;s first significant addition to the International Space Station in more than a decade, and it will provide the Russians with their first module dedicated primarily to research. &#34;Nauka&#34; means science in Russian.\n This is a sizable module, including crew quarters, an airlock for scientific experiments, and much more. With a mass of about 24 metric tons, it is about 20 percent larger than the biggest Russian segment of the station, the Zvezda service module.\n The timing for this launch, scheduled for as early as July 15 on a Proton rocket, is notable. For one, the multi-purpose Nauka module is more than a dozen years late due to a lack of budget for the project on top of technical issues. At times, it seemed like the module was never actually going to launch.\n Additionally, Russia is launching its largest module at a time when its future participation in the International Space Station program is uncertain. Russian officials have said the existing hardware on orbit, much of which is more than two decades old, is aging beyond repair. The Russians  have said they may pull out of the program in 2025 and build a brand-new station.\n    So why launch a new module just a few years before exiting the station? One possibility is that the Russians are simply posturing. Some NASA officials have speculated privately that this may be an angle to obtain new funds from the United States. With the success of SpaceX&#39;s Crew Dragon vehicle and nearing availability of Boeing&#39;s Starliner, NASA is no longer annually sending hundreds of millions of dollars to Roscosmos to purchase Soyuz seats for access to the station. This was an important source of funding for Russia&#39;s space program.\n However, NASA would like to keep the station flying for another decade, and for this it needs the Russians.\u00a0The first elements of the International Space Station were launched in 1998, and it was designed such that the US and Russian segments were dependent upon one another for attitude control, power, and other critical resources. The NASA officials suspect Russia may seek &#34;maintenance&#34; funding from the United States in return for keeping its part of the space station going.\n Nauka&#39;s launch is an important symbolic win for Russia&#39;s space program, in that it is increasingly rare for Roscosmos to develop and fly new hardware. Mostly, the program maintains and launches decades-old spacecraft such as the Soyuz vehicle and the Proton rocket.\n After being encapsulated in its payload fairing, Nauka will now move to a &#34;filling station&#34; at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, where it will be fueled and pressurized. After that, it will be mated to its Proton rocket for a launch that may occur as soon as July 15.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:52:30", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af,\u63a8\u51fa,launching", "title": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u5982\u679c\u5b83\u62d4\u51fa\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u63a8\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ad9\uff1f ", "title_en": "Why is Russia launching a new module to the space station if it\u2019s pulling out?", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/decades-in-the-making-russias-nauka-module-to-finally-take-flight/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af", "\u63a8\u51fa", "launching"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "754d45756bc0f280e04eee22688b2ae8.jpg", "infoid": 1068634, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u4e00\u79cb\u5b63\u6b63\u5728\u5851\u9020\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u79d1\u5b66\u5c0f\u8bf4\u7684\u7c89\u4e1d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u7c89\u4e1d\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f10\u670822\u65e5\u7684Dunis Villeneuve\uff06\uff0339;\u82f9\u679c\u7535\u89c6+\u7ec8\u4e8e\u5ba3\u5e03\u4e86\u7089\u6392\u7684\u9996\u6620\u65e5\u671f\uff0c\u590f\u5b63\u9884\u671f\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7535\u89c6\u9002\u5e94\u7684ISAAC Asimov\uff06\uff0339;\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u7cfb\u5217\u3002\u524d\u4e09\u96c6\u5c06\u4e8e2021\u5e749\u670824\u65e5\u9996\u6b21\u4eae\u76f8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u4e4b\u540e\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u6bcf\u5468\u53d1\u4f5c\u3002\n \u201c\u4ece\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u7cfb\u5217\u9996\u6b21\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u51e0\u5341\u5e74\u6765\u770b\uff0cAsimov\u7684\u9884\u8a00\u79d1\u5e7b\u4f5c\u54c1\u4ece\u672a\u6bd4\u73b0\u5728\u66f4\u52a0\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u201dShowrunner David Goyer\u5728\u4e00\u4efd\u58f0\u660e\u4e2d\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u6210\u957f\uff0c\u6211\u541e\u566c\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u68a6\u60f3\u6709\u4e00\u5929\u5728\u5c4f\u5e55\u4e0a\u770b\u5230\u5b83 - \u4f46\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7535\u5f71\u4f3c\u4e4e\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u62e5\u62b1\u91ce\u5fc3\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u7684\u66f4\u5e7f\u9614\u7684\u666f\u89c2\u548c\u4e0e\u82f9\u679c\u548c\u65af\u5854\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9d\u8d35\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6b63\u4e49\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5c06\u8be5\u7cfb\u5217\u5e26\u5230\u5c4f\u5e55\u4e0a\u3002\u201c\n  \u5f53\u9769\u547d\u535a\u58eb\u54c8\u91cc\u00b7\u7d22\u5c14\u987f\uff08Jared Harris\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u5e1d\u56fd\u7684\u5373\u5c06\u57ae\u53f0\uff0c\u4ed6\u548c\u4e00\u652f\u5fe0\u8bda\u7684\u7c89\u4e1d\u4e50\u961f\u5192\u9669\u5230\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u7684\u8fdc\u822a\uff0c\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bd5\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u660e\u7684\u672a\u6765\u3002\u7531Hari\uff06\uff0339;

Not only are we getting Denis Villeneuve&#39;s film adaptation of   Dune on  October 22, but Apple TV+ has finally announced the premiere date for the streamer&#39;s hotly anticipated\u00a0  Foundation, a TV adaptation of Isaac Asimov&#39;s hugely influential series. The first three episodes will debut on September 24, 2021, with weekly episodes released after that.\n \u201cIn the decades since the  Foundation series first saw print, Asimov\u2019s prophetic science-fiction work has never been more relevant than it is now,\u201d said showrunner David Goyer in a statement. \u201cGrowing up, I\u00a0devoured  Foundation\u00a0and dreamed of one day seeing it on screen\u2014but a feature film didn\u2019t seem big enough to embrace the ambition.\u00a0Thanks to the broader landscape of\u00a0streaming and a\u00a0valuable\u00a0partnership with Apple and Skydance, we are able to bring the series to the screen in a way that truly does it justice.\u201d\n  When revolutionary Dr. Hari Seldon (Jared Harris) predicts the impending fall of the Empire, he and a band of loyal followers venture to the far reaches of the galaxy to establish The Foundation in an attempt\u00a0to rebuild and preserve the future of civilization. Enraged by Hari&#39;s claims, the ruling Cleons \u2014 a long line of emperor clones\u2014fear their grasp on the galaxy may be weakening as they\u2019re forced to reckon with\u00a0the potential reality of losing their legacy forever.\n Harris plays Seldon, with Lee Pace co-starring as Brother Day, current emperor of the galaxy and part of a long line of emperor clones (the aforementioned Cleons). Lou Llobell plays Seldon&#39;s mathematical genius proteg\u00e9, Gaal; Leah Harvey plays a gender-swapped Salvor, warden of Terminus; and Laura Birn plays Eto Demerzel, aide to Brother Day.\n    Other listed characters include Brother Dusk (Terrence Mann), the ruling family&#39;s oldest living member, and Brother Dawn (Cassian Bilton), the youngest member and heir apparent to Brother Day. There&#39;s also Daniel MacPherson as Hugo, T&#39;Nia Miller as Halima, Pravessh Rana as Rowan, Kubbra Sait as Phara, Mido Hamada as Shadow Master Obrecht, Amy Tyger as Azura, and\u00a0Buddy Skelton as Keir.\n  It has been more than a year since we  got the first teaser, unveiled in June 2020 at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). That included some brief commentary from Goyer, noting all the past efforts to adapt  Foundation over the last 50 years, as well as the enormous influence the series had on  Star Wars. There were some accompanying behind-the-scenes photographs, too, but mostly it just introduced\u00a0the basic premise, along with some visually stunning shots of the scenes that had been completed before the pandemic shutdown. Since then there has been nothing, save for a  few brief glimpses earlier this month when Apple TV+ released its &#34;summer and beyond&#34; preview trailer.\n This new two-minute teaser opens with a lone figure walking through a dark corridor to a secret laboratory where cloned fetuses are suspended in fluid. It&#39;s Brother Dusk. &#34;You can&#39;t be here,&#34; Eto tells him. &#34;I can&#39;t be the first person who wanted to see my youngest self,&#34; he replies. &#34;Strange, watching yourself being born.&#34; Next we cut to Brother Day bragging about how their genetic dynasty has reigned for over four centuries, bringing peace to thousands of worlds. But he rants that this stability is now being threatened by a single man.\n That would be Seldon, of course, who insists in his defense that he is not a revolutionary. Furthermore, his alarming calculations about the demise of civilization are deemed correct by Gaal. &#34;Order will vanish,&#34; Seldon insists, as scenes of chaos and destruction play out. &#34;Wars will be endless. You can&#39;t save yourselves. But you can save your legacy.&#34; It&#39;s a doom-and-gloom message, but, nonetheless, Seldon amasses a following, much to Brother Day&#39;s chagrin.

The new group is an independently governed directed fund of the Linux Foundation, with the goals of improving trust, choice, inclusivity, and openness in voice recognition technology.\n While similar to Amazon&#39;s  Voice Interoperability Initiative\u00a0in some ways, the OVN claims a primary focus on ethics. Although Amazon&#39;s effort does touch on user choice and freedom, its primary goal is considerably narrower than OVN&#39;s\u2014to provide &#34;multiple, simultaneous voice services on the same product, each with its own wake word.&#34; Amazon did not say much about ethical restrictions or guidelines for those individual services, either in its  current mission statement or in the 2019  press release announcing it.\n The Open Voice Network is a neutral nonprofit industry association with some impressive names in its founding-member registry, including Target and Microsoft. OVN&#39;s goal is not to develop the technology itself but to deliver open, trustworthy, and inclusive standards and usage guidelines.\n OVN&#39;s initial press release goes into further detail, stating that the association will begin by focusing in these areas:\n Standards development: research and recommendations toward the global standards that will enable user choice, inclusivity, and trust.\n Industry value and awareness: identification and sharing of conversational AI best practices that are both horizontal and specific to vertical industries, serving as the source of insight and value for voice assistance.\n Advocacy: working with and through existing industry associations on relevant regulatory and legislative issues, including those of data privacy.\n Membership in the Open Voice Network entails supporting its research, awareness, and advocacy with direct resource contribution as well as active participation in its conferences and workshops.\n    Mike Dolan, senior VP and project manager at the Linux Foundation, says that &#34;voice [command] is expected to be a primary interface to the digital world... it is already increasingly being used beyond smart speakers to include applications in automobiles, smartphones, and home electronics devices of all types.&#34; He goes on to say that &#34;the potential impact of [voice] is staggering, and we&#39;re excited to bring it under the open governance model of the Linux Foundation.&#34;\n Target VP of Architecture Joel Crabb describes Target as &#34;continuously exploring and embracing new technologies,&#34; including voice recognition, and states that &#34;the Linux Foundation, with its role in advancing open source for all, is the perfect home for this initiative.&#34;\n Microsoft Azure AI General Manager Ali Dalloul underlines the importance of the technology itself, saying, &#34;to speak is human&#34;\u2014and following that up with a bold statement that &#34;voice is rapidly becoming the primary interaction modality between users and their devices and services at home and work.&#34; (We aren&#39;t certain we agree that voice command as the\u00a0 primary method of communication with devices and systems will arrive soon\u2014or perhaps ever\u2014but it&#39;s certainly increasingly important.)\n Founding OVN member and Schwarz Gruppe\u00a0Chief Digital Officer Rolf Schumann points out the stark need for ethical design and standards in voice recognition: &#34;voice includes more information than a fingerprint and can entail data about the emotional state or mental health of a user. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to put data protection standards in place to protect the user&#39;s privacy. This is the only way we will contribute to the future of voice.&#34;\n Sponsoring memberships of the Open Voice Network are available to enterprises in Platinum, Gold, and &#34;Advocate&#34; levels at $100K, $50K, and $7.5K annually, respectively, with Platinum sponsors serving on the OVN steering committee and the other two levels &#34;represented&#34; on the committee. Individuals and smaller businesses wishing to get involved may do so as  Friends\u00a0of the Open Voice Network\u2014a commitment that requires volunteer participation and signing a charter but no cash contributions.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:52:00", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "linux,\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a,foundation,\u5305\u62ec", "title": "Linux\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u6b63\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u6539\u5584\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u9053\u5fb7 ", "title_en": "The Linux Foundation is working to improve voice recognition ethics", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/the-linux-foundation-is-working-to-improve-voice-recognition-ethics/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["linux", "\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a", "\u5305\u62ec"]}]
