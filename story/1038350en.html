I was fine with that; as a fellow treasure hunter, I completely understood his desire for anonymity.</p><p> 自9月以来，我们一直在发送电子邮件，老实说，我从未期望知道他的真实身份。我对此很好。作为一名寻宝猎人，我完全理解他对匿名的渴望。</p><p> Since 2017, I had been pursuing Fenn’s treasure, too, becoming a kinda-sorta searcher in order to tell the story of Fenn’s hunt in my upcoming book   Chasing the Thrill , to be published by Knopf in June. I’d been in the trenches, read Fenn’s  clue-filled poem over and over, ended up in places I probably shouldn’t have been, and gone to places where other people died trying to find it.</p><p> 自2017年以来，我也一直在追求芬恩的宝藏，成为一位有点搜刮的人，以便在我即将于6月由诺夫出版的书《追逐刺激》中讲述芬恩的狩猎故事。我曾在战the中，一遍又一遍地阅读芬恩的线索诗，最终到达了我本不该去的地方，然后去了其他人为寻找它而死的地方。</p><p> A decade ago, Fenn hid his treasure chest, containing gold and other valuables estimated to be worth at least a million dollars, somewhere in the Rocky Mountains. Not long after, he published a memoir called   The Thrill of the Chase , which included a mysterious 24-line poem that, if solved, would lead searchers to the treasure. Fenn had suggested that the loot was secreted away at the place where he had envisioned lying down to die, back when he’d believed a 1988 cancer diagnosis was terminal. Since the hunt began in 2010, many thousands of searchers had gone out in pursuit— at least five of them losing their lives in the process—and the chase became an international story.</p><p> 十年前，芬恩（Fenn）在落基山脉（Rocky Mountains）的某个地方藏了宝藏，里面装有黄金和其他贵重物品，价值至少一百万美元。不久之后，他发表了一部名为《追赶的刺激》的回忆录，其中包括一首神秘的24行诗，如果解决了这首诗，它将带领搜索者找到这件宝藏。芬恩曾暗示，战利品是在他原本打算躺下死亡的地方被偷走的，当时他以为是1988年癌症诊断即将结束。自2010年开始搜寻以来，成千上万的搜寻者纷纷追捕-至少有五名搜寻者在此过程中丧生-追逐成为了国际故事。</p><p> So many people had invested and sacrificed so much in pursuit of Fenn’s treasure that it was possible the finder would face threats, be they legal or physical, from people who resented them or wished them ill.</p><p> 太多人为追求芬恩的宝藏付出了巨大的努力和牺牲，以至于发现者可能会受到仇恨或希望他们生病的人的威胁，无论是合法的还是肉体的。</p><p>  This past June, Fenn announced that the treasure had been found by a man from “back east” who wanted to remain anonymous—even, once we were in contact, to me. So despite exchanging dozens of emails with the finder, and discussing the details of the chest and what locating it meant to him, I never pressed him about who he was, and he never volunteered.</p><p>  今年6月，Fenn宣布，这名来自“后东”的人发现了这笔宝贝，他想保持匿名-即使我们联系后也是如此。因此，尽管与取景器交换了数十封电子邮件，并讨论了胸部的详细信息以及胸部的位置对他意味着什么，但我从未向他施压过他，而是他从未自愿。</p><p> Last week, he told me the situation had changed. Fenn had been targeted by lawsuits both before and after the chest was found, by hunters claiming that the treasure was rightfully theirs. One of the lawsuits, filed immediately after Fenn announced the hunt was over, also targets the unknown finder as a defendant, claiming that he had stolen the plaintiff’s solve and used it to find the chest. That litigation had advanced to a procedural stage during which the finder expected his name would likely come out in court. So while he remained guarded about his solve and the location where he discovered the treasure, he now didn’t mind telling me who he really was.</p><p> 上周，他告诉我情况已经改变。芬恩在发现胸部之前和之后都遭到了诉讼的袭击，猎人声称这是他们的宝藏是正确的。在芬恩宣布狩猎结束后立即提起的一项诉讼中，也以这位不知名的发现者为被告，声称他偷走了原告的解决方案并用它来找到胸部。该诉讼已进入程序阶段，在此期间，发现者预计他的名字很可能会出庭。因此，尽管他对自己的解决方案和发现宝藏的位置保持警惕，但现在他不介意告诉我他的真实身份。 </p><p> And that’s when I learned that a 32-year-old Michigan native and medical student was the person who had finally solved Fenn’s poem. His name is Jack Stuef.</p><p>从那时起，我得知一位32岁的密歇根州本地人和医学生终于解决了芬恩的诗。他的名字叫杰克·史蒂夫。</p><p> Stuef first heard about Fenn’s chase on Twitter in early 2018, and couldn’t believe it had escaped his notice for eight whole years. He was instantly hooked.</p><p> 斯图夫（Stuef）最早在2018年初就听说了芬恩（Fenn）在Twitter上的追逐，而且无法相信这已经逃脱了他整整八年的关注。他立刻被迷住了。</p><p> “I’ve probably thought about it for at least a couple hours a day, every day, since I learned about it,” Stuef says. “Every day.”</p><p> “自从我了解到这一点以来，我每天可能至少每天要考虑几个小时，” Stuef说。 “每天。”</p><p> The treasure hunt immediately brought him back to his youth, when he was obsessed with a 2002 TV series called   Push, Nevada, which allowed viewers to try and solve a real-life mystery that carried a million-dollar prize. Stuef also got caught up in a book by magician David Blaine,   Mysterious Stranger, which combined autobiography with a treasure hunt and offered a $100,000 prize.</p><p> 寻宝活动立即将他带回了年轻时代，那时他迷上了2002年在内华达州电视台播出的电视连续剧，这使观众能够尝试解决一个现实生活中的谜团，并获得了百万美元的奖金。斯托夫还被魔术师大卫·布莱恩（David Blaine）的《神秘的陌生人》（Mysterious Stranger）所吸引，该书将自传与寻宝结合在一起，并提供了100,000美元的奖金。</p><p> Over time, those teenage dreams of adventure receded, and Stuef went on to attend Georgetown University, where he served as editor in chief of the   Georgetown Heckler, a campus humor magazine. He graduated in December 2009  and began a career as a writer, both in humor—he worked for the  Onion—and in more traditional media. He became embroiled in a few controversies early in his career, both at Wonkette, which he left after he made what Poynter describes as  “a tasteless joke about one of Sarah Palin’s children having Down Syndrome,” and while freelancing for Buzzfeed, which  had to apologize after an article Stuef wrote incorrectly painted a popular internet cartoonist as a hard-line Republican. He left the media business soon after.</p><p> 随着时间的流逝，那些少年冒险的梦想逐渐消退，Stuef继续就读乔治敦大学，在那里他担任了校园幽默杂志乔治敦·赫克勒的总编辑。他于2009年12月毕业，以幽默的方式（他为洋葱工作）和更传统的媒体开始了作家生涯。在职业生涯初期，他陷入了一些争议，包括在沃恩卡特（Wonkette）的生活，在他将波恩特描述为“关于萨拉·佩林的一个患有唐氏综合症的孩子的无味的笑话”之后离开了他，并在为Buzzfeed腾空工作时不得不这么做。斯托夫（Stuef）错误地写了一篇文章，道歉，将一位受欢迎的互联网漫画家描绘成强硬的共和党人。此后不久，他离开了媒体业务。</p><p> “I don’t think those were giant incidents,” Stuef says. “I regret them, but I don’t think about them very often. It was a long time ago now.”</p><p> “我不认为这是大事件，”施特夫说。 “我为他们感到后悔，但我并不经常考虑他们。现在已经很久了。”</p><p> He soon entered a postbaccalaureate program, and then enrolled in medical school. But he disliked most everything about medicine beyond treating patients, he says, and something else captured his attention: Fenn’s chase. He was soon reading the hunter blogs to learn the basics, and he bought Fenn’s memoir,  The Thrill of the Chase, before diving into as much primary source material as he could find. His method was to devour every Fenn interview, doing anything he could to hear and absorb his words directly, in an effort to better understand the man’s personality and motivations.</p><p> 他很快进入了学士学位课程，然后就读于医学院。但他说，除了治疗病人以外，他对医学的所有事物都不满意，还有其他吸引了他的注意力：芬恩的追逐。他很快阅读了猎人的博客以学习基础知识，并在深入研究尽可能多的主要原始资料之前，购买了芬恩的回忆录《追逐的刺激》。他的方法是吞噬Fenn的每次采访，尽其所能直接听取和吸收他的话，以更好地理解该人的性格和动机。 </p><p> As the hunt took up more and more of his time, Stuef mostly kept the extent of his pursuit hidden from friends and family. He didn’t think they would understand.</p><p>随着狩猎工作花费了越来越多的时间，Stuef大部分时候都将自己的追求范围隐藏在朋友和家人的面前。他认为他们不会理解。</p><p> “I think I got a little embarrassed by how obsessed I was with it,” Stuef says. “If I didn’t find it, I would look kind of like an idiot. And maybe I didn’t want to admit to myself what a hold it had on me.”</p><p> “我认为我对它的痴迷程度感到有些尴尬，” Stuef说。 “如果我找不到它，我看起来会像个白痴。也许我不想承认自己对我的影响。”</p><p> Two years later, he had achieved what so many other searchers could not, finding and claiming Fenn’s treasure.  (Stuef’s status as the finder was independently verified with the Fenn family.)  He retrieved the chest on Saturday, June 6, 2020, in Wyoming, and began the long drive down to Santa Fe to deliver it to Fenn that same day. That evening, news of the find was already beginning to come out, as Fenn believed it must. “‘We should let [searchers] know as soon as you have it,’” Stuef says Fenn told him.</p><p> 两年后，他发现并声称了芬恩的宝藏，实现了许多其他搜索者无法做到的目标。 （斯图夫作为寻人者的身份已由芬恩一家独立核实。）他于2020年6月6日星期六在怀俄明州捡起了箱子，并开始长途跋涉前往圣达菲，于同日将其运送到芬恩。那天晚上，Fenn认为一定会发现这个发现的消息。斯托恩说：“‘一旦发现，我们应该让[搜索者]知道。”</p><p> “His thought was that, as soon as it’s out of place, we need to let people know,” Stuef says. “People have died. There could be issues.”</p><p> “他的想法是，一旦出现问题，我们需要让人们知道。” Stuef说。人们死了。可能有问题。”</p><p>  Stuef asked Fenn, though, that he be allowed to remain anonymous, and they both seemed to agree that the location of the find should be kept secret.</p><p>  斯托夫问芬恩，允许他保持匿名，他们俩似乎都同意应将发现的地点保密。</p><p> But controversy quickly swirled, as many hunters, unsatisfied with the lack of disclosure, decided this meant that  something nefarious was afoot—that Fenn had never really hidden the treasure, or that he had unilaterally ended the hunt without a real finder. The backlash took Fenn by surprise, according to those around him. To address it, several weeks after the find, he released photos of the chest and of himself going through it after Stuef delivered it to Santa Fe, which provided enough confirmation for some. In July, Fenn suggested to Stuef that they also reveal the state where the treasure was found, in order to give further closure to some hunters. Stuef agreed.</p><p> 但是争议迅速激化，因为许多猎人对缺乏信息的披露不满意，认为这意味着一件邪恶的事情即将到来–芬恩从未真正藏过宝藏，或者他没有真正的发现者就单方面结束了狩猎。据周围的人说，强烈的反对使芬恩感到惊讶。为了解决这个问题，在发现之后数周，他发布了胸部的照片，并在Stuef将其运送到圣达菲后亲自检查了胸部的照片，这为某些事情提供了足够的确认。 7月，Fenn向Stuef建议，他们还应透露发现宝藏的州，以便进一步关闭某些猎人。斯托夫表示同意。</p><p> Beyond that, though, he remained silent, and might have stayed that way for some time.</p><p> 但是除此之外，他保持沉默，并且可能会保持这种状态一段时间。 </p><p>   On September 23, two weeks after Fenn passed away in his home at age 90, a post surfaced on Medium, a platform that allows users to self-publish essays and other writing, anonymously if they choose. Called “ A Remembrance of Forrest Fenn,” it carried the byline “The Finder,” along with a bio that declared: “The author is the finder and owner of the Forrest Fenn Treasure.”</p><p>9月23日，即芬恩90岁高龄去世后的两周，一个帖子出现在Medium平台上，该平台允许用户自行选择发表论文和其他作品的匿名方式。它被称为“ Forrest Fenn的纪念”，带有副词“ The Finder”，并附有以下传记：“作者是Forrest Fenn宝藏的发现者和所有者。”</p><p> In 3,000 well-crafted words, the finder penned an ode to Fenn, who he described as his friend, even though he’d only known him briefly.</p><p> 搜寻者用3,000个精心制作的字眼向芬恩（Fenn）致敬，尽管他只是短暂地认识了他，但芬恩却将他形容为他的朋友。</p><p> “I am the person who found Forrest’s famed treasure,” he wrote. “The moment it happened was not the triumphant Hollywood ending some surely envisioned; it just felt like I had just survived something and was fortunate to come out the other end.”</p><p> 他写道：“我就是发现福雷斯特著名宝藏的人。” “发生的那一刻并不是好莱坞的胜利，一定可以预见的结局；感觉就像我刚刚幸存下来，很幸运能走出另一端。”</p><p> In his essay, the finder revealed a great deal about the circumstances under which he had discovered the treasure—but, crucially, he would not divulge exactly where he had located it, and said he didn’t plan to. He was also careful not to let any details about his own identity slip, indicating only that he was a millennial and had student loans to pay off. Beyond that, he was an enigma.</p><p> 在他的文章中，发现者透露了他发现宝藏的情况，但是，至关重要的是，他不会透露所藏宝物的确切位置，并且说他不打算这样做。他还非常小心，不要让任何有关自己身份的细节溜走，只表明他是一个千禧一代，并且有学生贷款可以还清。除此之外，他还是个谜。</p><p> He explained that in 2018 he had figured out the location where the longtime Santa Fe art dealer and former fighter pilot wished to die, and then spent a combined 25 days over the next two years searching the general area until he finally located the treasure. He said that, to find the solution, he’d carefully listened to things Fenn had said in interviews, finding a few crucial crumbs.</p><p> 他解释说，在2018年，他已经弄清楚了圣达菲艺术商人和前战斗机飞行员长期想死的地方，然后在接下来的两年里花了25天的时间在整个地区搜寻，直到他终于找到了宝藏。他说，为了找到解决方案，他仔细听了芬恩在采访中所说的话，发现了一些关键的碎屑。</p><p> “[Fenn] never made more than a couple of subtle slip-ups in front of all the dogged reporters who came to his house, and even those apparently haven’t been caught by anyone besides me,” the finder wrote.</p><p> 该发现者写道：“ [芬恩]在来他家的所有顽固的记者面前做过两次微妙的滑倒，甚至那些显然还没有被我以外的人抓到的人，”发现者写道。</p><p> He included pictures of the chest, some of them taken in the wilderness shortly after the treasure was found, others taken at what was assumed to be a lawyer’s office, showing Fenn examining the chest.</p><p> 他包括了胸部的照片，其中一些是在发现宝藏后不久在野外拍摄的，其他则是在假定为律师事务所的地方拍摄的，显示芬恩正在检查胸部。 </p><p> Still, there were doubters. Many searchers refused to believe that the Medium post was written by the true finder, and suggested it was fraudulent—perhaps written by Fenn’s grandson, Shiloh Old, or by his professional writer pal,  Douglas Preston, or even by Fenn himself before his death, intended to be released posthumously.</p><p>仍然有怀疑者。许多搜索者拒绝相信“中型”帖子是由真正的发现者撰写的，并暗示该帖子是欺诈性的-可能是由芬恩的孙子希洛·奥尔德（Shiloh Old）或其职业作家朋友道格拉斯·普雷斯顿（Douglas Preston）甚至是芬恩本人在他去世之前撰写的，打算在死后释放。</p><p> But I didn’t think any of that. In fact, after finishing the essay, I was pretty certain it was all real. And although the finder wrote that he would eventually answer more questions, the journalist in me didn’t particularly want to wait, or to leave what he answered up to him alone.</p><p> 但是我什么都没有想到。实际上，在完成这篇文章之后，我可以肯定它是真实的。尽管发现者写信说他最终会回答更多的问题，但我里面的记者并不想特别等待，也不想独自回答他的问题。</p><p>  Medium doesn’t generally allow readers to directly contact the author of a piece, which is one reason it’s good for anonymous posting. It does allow users to post public comments, and more than 100 people quickly did that, most of them supportive, some skeptical, a few angry and aggressive. But I wasn’t going to just post my email address in the comments, where anyone could read it. Doing that left me no guarantee that the person I might end up in contact with would be the finder.</p><p>  一般情况下，Medium不允许读者直接与文章的作者联系，这是对匿名发布有益的原因之一。它的确允许用户发布公共评论，并且有100多个人迅速做到了这一点，其中大多数人都表示支持，有些人持怀疑态度，一些人生气和侵略性。但是我不会在评论中张贴我的电子邮件地址，任何人都可以阅读。这样做使我无法保证最终可能与我联系的那个人就是寻人者。</p><p> I had one trick up my sleeve, though. There’s a little-known way to send a direct message to the author of a Medium story: you flag a section of text, indicating that it contains an error or typo. This notifies the author that something needs to be corrected. The system doesn’t give you a lot of space, just enough to describe the problem. So I flagged a section, barely squeezed in who I was and my email address, and hoped for the best. I had no assurances that the finder would look at the message, or that he would understand exactly why he should get in touch. But it was worth a shot.</p><p> 不过，我袖手旁观。有一种鲜为人知的向中型故事的作者发送直接消息的方式：您标记一段文字，表明其中包含错误或错字。这通知作者需要纠正某些问题。该系统没有给您太多空间，仅能描述问题。因此，我标记了一个部分，几乎没有压缩我的身份和电子邮件地址，并希望能做到最好。我无法保证发现者会看到该消息，或者他会确切地理解为什么他应该与他取得联系。但这值得一试。</p><p> Less than a day later, an email popped into my in-box. The finder had replied. He’d heard of my book project, he said, and he might be willing to talk to me.</p><p> 不到一天后，一封电子邮件弹出了我的收件箱。发现者已答复。他说，他听说过我的图书专案，他可能愿意与我交谈。</p><p> And so began months of back-and-forth, sometimes involving several emails a day. It didn’t really matter that I didn’t know who the finder was for most of that time. I hung on every detail, every minor revelation he offered up about the treasure that had occupied me for so long.</p><p> 这样就开始了几个月的来回往返，有时一天要涉及几封电子邮件。其实我大部分时间都不知道取景器是谁，这并不重要。我迷住了每一个细节，他透露的每一个次要启示都是关于占据我这么久的宝藏。</p><p>  Last week, after a lull in our ongoing conversation, the finder emailed again, explaining that one of the court cases surrounding the find had taken an unexpected turn, and his name was likely to come out as part of the process. So he told me who he was, and gave me permission to tell the world.</p><p>  上周，在我们进行中的交谈平息之后，发现者再次发送电子邮件，解释说关于该发现的法院案件之一发生了意外变化，他的名字很可能会在此过程中露面。所以他告诉了我他是谁，并允许我告诉世界。 </p><p> The case that prompted him to step from behind the curtain was brought by a Chicago real estate attorney named Barbara Andersen, who  alleges that the unknown finder of the treasure had located it by hacking her texts and emails and stealing her solve. She believed the treasure was in New Mexico.</p><p>促使他走出帷幕的案子是由一位名叫Barbara Andersen的芝加哥房地产律师提出的，该律师声称，这名宝藏的未知发现者通过入侵她的文字和电子邮件并窃取她的解决方案找到了它。她认为宝藏在新墨西哥州。</p><p> Stuef says he never met nor heard of Andersen before the suit; he denies her charges and says the treasure was nowhere near New Mexico. That has not stopped a New Mexico federal court judge from allowing the suit to proceed. Last week, Stuef learned that, as a result of Fenn’s death, the subpoena against Fenn would be transferred to his heirs and estate, which is in possession of Stuef’s information. This should allow Andersen to refile her suit, naming Stuef as a defendant.</p><p> 斯托夫说，他在诉讼之前从未见过安德森，也从未听说过。他否认了她的指控，并说该财宝不在新墨西哥州附近。但这并没有阻止新墨西哥联邦法院的法官允许诉讼继续进行。上周，斯图夫获悉，由于费恩之死，针对费恩的传票将转移到他的继承人和财产中，这是斯托夫所掌握的信息。这应该允许安德森（Andersen）重新提起诉讼，将史蒂夫（Stuf）任命为被告。</p><p> Stuef had expected that finding the chest would bring some level of blowback, that his possession of an item desired by so many makes him a target.</p><p> 斯托夫曾期望找到胸部会带来一定程度的反冲，他拥有如此之多的物品使他成为目标。</p><p> “I thought that whoever found the chest would be absolutely hated, because it ends everyone’s dream,” he says. “That’s something of a burden. I realize I put an end to something that meant so much to so many people.”</p><p> 他说：“我认为发现胸部的人绝对会讨厌，因为它终结了每个人的梦想。” “这是一个负担。我意识到我结束了对很多人意义重大的事情。”</p><p> But even if he anticipated challenges to his find, being a subject of a lawsuit has been an unsettling experience.</p><p> 但是，即使他预见到他的发现将面临挑战，但作为诉讼主体还是令人不安的经历。</p><p> “I always thought that, based on people suing Forrest in the past, it was something that could happen,” Steuf says.</p><p> “我一直认为，基于过去人们对Forrest的起诉，这是有可能发生的，” Steuf说。</p><p> This treasure hunt has never been easy on its participants; Fenn and his family experienced a great deal of harassment from searchers who went too far during the years the hunt was active—everything from stalking to threats to  a break-in at Fenn’s home in Santa Fe. This is why Stuef hoped to remain anonymous, and why, even now, with his name known, he won’t disclose where he’s living.</p><p> 对参与者而言，这种寻宝从未如此简单。芬恩和他的家人遭受了搜寻者的极大骚扰，这些人在狩猎活动活跃的年代里走得太远了，从跟踪到威胁到在芬恩位于圣达菲的住所闯入的一切事情。这就是Stuef希望保持匿名的原因，以及为何即使在现在，他的名字仍然众所周知，他也不会透露自己的住所。 </p><p> Many searchers I’ve talked to appreciate his desire for anonymity, and I understand it as well. But one thing many searchers have a harder time grasping is Stuef’s decision to withhold where he found the treasure, even though the chest has since been removed.</p><p>我与许多搜索者交谈过，以感谢他对匿名的渴望，我也理解这一点。但是，许多搜寻者很难把握的一件事是，即使从那以后胸部已经被移走，Stuef还是决定保留他发现宝藏的位置。</p><p> People have died looking for the chest. Others have gone bankrupt. Many more have spent countless hours in search of it, and they want some degree of resolution. On our various excursions out West, my search partner and I both found ourselves a little too obsessed at points, and it took its toll. There are real human costs to this search, and knowing the final location could offer the desired sense of closure so many are now seeking.</p><p> 人们死于寻找胸部。其他人破产了。许多人花了无数小时来寻找它，他们想要某种程度的解决方案。在西部的各种旅行中，我和我的搜寻伙伴都发现自己对点太着迷了，并为此付出了代价。这种搜索需要付出实际的人力成本，并且知道最终的位置可以提供所需的关闭感，因此许多人正在寻求这种关闭感。</p><p>  “This is the most difficult question to answer, because I know there’s so many people who just want to know. They worked on this for a long time. And they just want to be handed the answer. I totally understand that. But doing that, I think, is a death sentence to this special place.”</p><p>  “这是最难回答的问题，因为我知道有很多人想知道。他们为此工作了很长时间。他们只是想得到答案。我完全明白这一点。但我认为，这样做是对这个特殊地方的死刑。”</p><p> Stuef fears that Fenn’s spot, if revealed, will become a pilgrimage site for Fenn devotees.</p><p> 斯托夫担心，如果发现芬恩的遗迹，它将成为芬恩奉献者的朝圣地。</p><p> “It’s not an appropriate place to become a tourist destination. It has huge meaning to Forrest, and I don’t want to see it destroyed,” Stuef says. “And as much as I tried not to develop an attachment to the place, eventually I did, as well. I had whole days out there looking, and I would take a nap in the afternoon every day, as I said on Medium, under the pine trees. It was very peaceful for me.”</p><p> “这里不适合成为旅游胜地。它对Forrest具有重大意义，我不想看到它被摧毁。” Stuef说。 “尽我所能不发展对该地方的依恋，最终我也做到了。我整天都在外面看，我每天下午都会在小睡下小睡，就像我在《 Medium》上说的那样。对我来说太和平了。”</p><p> Stuef is trying to find a balance between the various entities, because he feels responsible to all of them. To the search community and its desire to know the whole truth; to himself and his sense of what is right; to nature and this peaceful spot, which he does not want to see ruined; and to Fenn. Ultimately, Stuef believes he’s being consistent with what Fenn wanted when he was alive, and honoring his legacy.</p><p> Stuef试图在各个实体之间找到平衡，因为他觉得对所有实体负责。搜索社区及其渴望了解全部事实的愿望；对自己和对正确事物的感觉；他不想看到毁灭的自然和这个和平的地方；和芬恩。最终，Stuef相信他与Fenn活着时所想要的保持一致，并尊重他的遗产。</p><p> “He didn’t want to see it turned into a tourist attraction,” Stuef says of the treasure site. “We thought it was not appropriate for that to happen. He was willing to go to great lengths, very great lengths, to avoid ever having to tell the location.”</p><p> 斯托夫谈到宝藏地点时说：“他不想看到它变成一个旅游胜地。” “我们认为这种情况不合适。他愿意竭尽全力，避免不得不告诉位置。” </p><p>  Because of his stand, talking to Stuef can be maddening at times. For my book, I’ve interviewed him about his solve, discussed the process he used to come up with it, and chronicled the various searches he went on as he sought the exact spot, learning fascinating tidbits in the process. For example, he’s told me that one reason it took him two years to retrieve the treasure, even after figuring out the general area in 2018, was that the “blaze”—Fenn’s all-important final clue, found out in the wilderness, intended to let a searcher know they’re in the exact right spot—had been damaged. He doesn’t mind being open with all of that. And yet there are still things he holds back or talks around, in order to make sure, even now, that no one can figure out the precise location.</p><p>由于他的立场，有时可能会和Stuef说话发疯。对于我的书，我就他的解决方案采访了他，讨论了他提出解决方案的过程，并记述了他寻找确切位置时进行的各种搜索，并在过程中学习了一些有趣的花絮。例如，他告诉我，即使在弄清楚了2018年的大片区域后，花了两年时间才收回宝藏的一个原因是，“火焰”-芬恩在荒野中发现的最重要的最终线索，意图让搜索者知道他们位于正确的位置-已损坏。他不介意所有这些。然而，他仍然保留或谈论一些事情，以确保即使在现在，也没有人能知道确切的位置。</p><p> Still, listening to Stuef talk about it, he makes it seem so attainable, so simple: that the key was really just understanding Forrest Fenn. Stuef hunted solo, never discussed his search with others, stayed away from the blogs after his initial looks at them, and tried hard not to get caught up in any groupthink. He did his utmost just to focus on Fenn’s words and primary sources, and understand those as best he could.</p><p> 尽管如此，在听Stuef谈论它时，他使它看起来是如此容易实现，如此简单：关键实际上只是了解Forrest Fenn。 Stuef独自打猎，从未与他人讨论过他的搜索结果，在最初浏览过博客之后就远离博客了，并努力避免陷入任何集体思维中。他竭尽全力只是专注于芬恩的话语和主要来源，并尽可能地理解这些内容。</p><p> “I don’t want to ruin this treasure hunt by saying it was made for an English major, but it’s based on a close read of a text,” Stuef says. “I mean, that’s what it is. It’s having the correct interpretation of a poem. I understood him by reading his words, and listening to him talk over and over and over and over again. And seeking out anything I could get my hands on that told me who he was.”</p><p> 斯托夫说：“我不想说这是针对英语专业的学生，​​而以此来破坏寻宝活动，但这是基于对文字的仔细阅读。” “我的意思是，就是这样。它具有对诗歌的正确诠释。我通过阅读他的话，并一遍又一遍地听他讲话来理解他。寻找任何我能得到的东西告诉我他是谁。”</p><p> When asked if figuring out the puzzles required the use of anagrams, or GPS coordinates, or sophisticated codes of any sort, Stuef was clear in his response.</p><p> 当被问及找出谜题是否需要使用字谜，GPS坐标或任何形式的复杂代码时，Stuef的回答很清楚。</p><p> “No,” he says. “But I don’t want to say that people are stupid for thinking those things were valid, or that they were being irrational. I think Forrest designed this to be fun, and whatever people got out of it, that gave them fun, I think, to me, is rational. And they were doing it right, in that way.”</p><p> “不，”他说。 “但是我不想说人们愚蠢的认为这些事情是正确的，或者说他们是非理性的。我认为，福雷斯特（Forrest）将此设计为有趣的，无论人们从中​​获得什么，给他们带来乐趣，我认为这都是理性的。他们以这种方式做对了。”</p><p> The solution, Stuef says, is tied far more to understanding Fenn’s emotions, and to a close examination of the poem itself, than to puzzle-solving skills. Fenn simply didn’t care about those kinds of things. He was more interested in adventure, legacy, history, narrative.</p><p> 斯托夫说，解决方案不仅仅在于解决芬恩的情感，还在于对诗歌本身的仔细检查。 Fenn根本不在乎这些事情。他对冒险，遗产，历史和叙事更感兴趣。</p><p> “There was no reason to think that those things would be something he was interested in, or had any experience in,” Stuef says. “I mean, he was coming to this not from the perspective of being a huge fan of puzzles or a puzzle master. He was not a fan of armchair treasure hunts. His point of reference was pirates! His purpose was not to create a great puzzle and show everyone how smart and slick he was. His purpose was this weird idea to entomb himself. And to create a historic legend. None of that supports armchair solutions. And he was open about that.”</p><p> “没有理由认为这些东西将是他感兴趣的东西，或者有任何经验，” Stuef说。 “我的意思是，他之所以来到这个领域，并不是因为他是迷的迷或迷之大师。他不喜欢扶手椅寻宝。他的参考点是海盗！他的目的不是要制造一个大难题，而是要向所有人展示他多么聪明和光滑。他的目的是让自己陷入这个奇怪的想法。并创造了历史性的传奇。这些都不支持扶手椅解决方案。他对此持开放态度。” </p><p> So far, ownership of the chest has not made Stuef a rich man. He has not sold it yet, has not even had it appraised, but the expected windfall has allowed him to quit worrying about repaying his student loans for medical school. With that in mind, he has decided to leave the profession before becoming a practicing doctor, and may move into equities investing next.</p><p>到目前为止，胸部的所有权还没有使Stuef成为富翁。他还没有卖掉它，甚至还没有评估它，但是预期的意外之财使他退出了担心偿还医学院学生贷款的担忧。考虑到这一点，他决定在成为一名执业医生之前离开该行业，然后可能进入股票投资领域。</p><p> “I was kind of in this sunk-cost-fallacy dead end with that, where I didn’t want to quit, because I didn’t know what else to do,” he says. “I didn’t know how to pay off my loans if I didn’t become a doctor. [The chest] was kind of my lifeline.”</p><p> 他说：“我当时正处在沉没成本谬论的死胡同中，我不想辞职，因为我不知道该怎么办。” “如果我不去当医生，我不知道如何偿还贷款。 （胸部）是我的生命线。”</p><p> Once the time is right, he still plans to sell the chest. When he does, he will try to honor a “final wish” of Fenn’s: to have the chest end up in a specific place where searchers can view it, though he declined to say exactly where.</p><p> 时间合适的时候，他仍然打算卖掉那只箱子。当他这样做时，他将尝试兑现芬恩的“最终愿望”：将胸口放在一个特定的地方，供搜索者查看，尽管他拒绝透露确切的位置。</p><p> “Before he died, he was going to try to help me with getting a certain party to buy it,” Stuef says. “And I think his hope was that it would be able to be displayed. … And so that’s my first step. After that, I think I would probably try and sell to the public.”</p><p> “在他去世之前，他将尽力帮助我让某个聚会购买它，” Stuef说。 “我认为他希望它能够被展示。 …所以这是我的第一步。之后，我想我可能会尝试向公众出售。”</p><p> If it gets that far, he’s unsure whether it would be best to sell it as a complete package, or to break it up, allowing individual searchers to own a piece of Fenn’s treasure.</p><p> 如果能够做到这一点，他不确定是将其作为一个完整的包装出售还是将其分解以允许单个搜索者拥有芬恩的一件宝物是最好的选择。</p><p> “I’d guess we kind of try and test the market in some way to see what it would sell for all together, because there’s a good chance it’s worth more all together, as the Fenn treasure,” Stuef says. “But, you know, it’s possible. There are a lot of searchers out there who would want maybe one item in there, they couldn’t afford the whole thing, but it would mean a lot to them to have one item. So it is still possible to break out.”</p><p> “我想我们会以某种方式尝试测试市场，看看它可以一起出售什么，因为作为芬恩的宝藏，它很有可能一起拥有更大的价值，” Stuef说。 “但是，您知道，有可能。那里有很多搜索者想要其中的一件商品，他们负担不起全部费用，但是拥有一件商品对他们来说意义重大。因此仍然有可能突破。”</p><p> With the chest located, one part of the treasure hunt is finished now—the chase, the part that obsessed all of us and pushed us to places we maybe shouldn’t have been. But the story has not </p><p> 找到箱子后，寻宝工作已经完成了一部分，即追逐，这是困扰我们所有人并将我们推向我们本不应该去的地方的部分。但是故事还没有 </p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2419429/forrest-fenn-treasure-jack-stuef">https://www.outsideonline.com/2419429/forrest-fenn-treasure-jack-stuef</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/发现/">#发现</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/forrest/">#forrest</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/stuef/">#stuef</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
