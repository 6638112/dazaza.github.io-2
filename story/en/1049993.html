Bitcoin analysis online can be very polarizing; either written by hardcore bullish enthusiasts or dismissed as a worthless ponzi scheme. As a generalist investor with a value-slant and a global macro emphasis, I’ve sought to bridge the gap a bit by sharing my view of Bitcoin, which is currently bullish.</p><p> 也许本文会以某种方式帮助某些投资者做出决定。在线比特币分析可能会引起两极分化。要么由顽固的看涨爱好者撰写，要么被视为毫无价值的庞氏骗局。作为具有价值偏向和全球宏观重点的通才投资者，我试图通过分享我对当前看涨的比特币的观点来弥合差距。</p><p> Although I was aware of Bitcoin as a speculative small asset since around 2011, and knew someone who mined it on her computer back when that was possible (now it requires application-specific integrated circuits, due to heavy competition), I wrote my  first article on cryptocurrencies back in November 2017, when the price was in the $6500-$8000 range. During the week or two writing and editing period, the price rose substantially in that big range. My conclusion at the time was neutral-to-bearish, and I didn’t buy any.</p><p> 尽管我从2011年左右就意识到比特币是一种投机性小资产，并且认识到有人在可能的情况下在她的计算机上挖掘比特币（由于竞争激烈，现在需要专用集成电路），但我写了第一篇文章早在2017年11月，当时价格在6500-8000美元之间。在一周或两周的写作和编辑期间，价格大幅度上涨。当时我的结论是中性至看跌，我什么也没买。</p><p> Right now, there’s already a lot of optimism backed in; bitcoins and other major cryptocurrencies are extremely expensive compared to their estimated current usage. Investors are assuming that they will achieve widespread adoption and are paying up accordingly. That means investors should apply considerable caution.</p><p> 现在，已经有很多乐观的支持。与目前的估计使用量相比，比特币和其他主要的加密货币非常昂贵。投资者假设他们将获得广泛采用，并相应地付出代价。这意味着投资者应谨慎行事。</p><p> Within the next month or so after the original article, Bitcoin briefly soared to reach $20,000, but then crashed down to below $3,500 a year later, and has since recovered to bounce around in a wide trading range with little or no durable returns.</p><p> 在原始文章发布后的一个月左右的时间内，比特币短暂飙升至20,000美元，但一年后又跌至3500美元以下，此后恢复反弹，在宽广的交易范围内反弹，几乎没有或没有持久的回报。</p><p> From the time of my original article nearly two and a half years ago, Bitcoin underperformed the S&amp;P 500, gold, Treasury notes, and a variety of other asset classes, especially on a volatility-adjusted basis:</p><p> 从我将近两年半前的原始文章开始，比特币的表现就不及标准普尔500指数，黄金，美国国债和其他多种资产类别，尤其是在经过波动调整后的情况下： </p><p>  I’ve updated the article from time to time to refresh data and keep it relevant as changes happen in the industry, but other than keeping an eye on the space from time to time, I mostly ignored it.</p><p>我会不时更新文章，以刷新数据并使其与行业中的变化保持关联，但是除了不时关注空间之外，我大多忽略了它。</p><p> In early 2020, I revisited Bitcoin and became bullish. I recommended it as a small position in my  premium research service on April 12th, and bought some bitcoins for myself on April 20th. The price was around $6,900 for that stretch of time. Since that period in April, Bitcoin quickly shot up to the $9,000+ range with 30%+ returns, but its price is highly volatile, so those gains may or may not be durable:</p><p> 在2020年初，我重新访问了比特币并开始看涨。我在4月12日将其推荐给我的高级研究服务部门中的一个小职位，并在4月20日为自己购买了一些比特币。这段时间的价格约为6,900美元。自从四月份以来，比特币迅速上涨至9,000美元以上，回报率超过30％，但其价格波动很大，因此这些收益可能是持久的，也可能不是持久的：</p><p>  My base case is for Bitcoin to perform very well over the next 2 years, but we’ll see. I like it as a small position within a diversified portfolio, without much concern for periodic corrections, using capital I’m willing to risk.</p><p>  我的基本情况是，比特币在未来两年内的表现非常好，但是我们会看到的。我喜欢将其作为分散投资组合中的小头寸，而无需担心定期调整，使用我愿意冒险的资金。</p><p> As someone with an engineering and finance blended background, Bitcoin’s design has always interested me from a theoretical point of view, but it wasn’t until this period in early 2020 that I could put enough catalysts together to build a constructive case for its price action in the years ahead. As a new asset class, Bitcoin took time to build a price history and some sense of the cycles it goes through, and plenty of valuable research has been published over the years to synthesize the data.</p><p> 作为具有工程和金融混合背景的人，比特币的设计从理论上一直使我感兴趣，但是直到2020年初，我才可以投入足够的催化剂来为价格行动建立一个有建设性的案例在未来的几年中。作为一种新的资产类别，比特币花了一些时间来建立价格历史并对其经历的周期有所了解，并且多年来已经发表了大量有价值的研究来合成数据。</p><p> So, I’m neither a perma-bull on Bitcoin at any price, or someone that dismisses it outright. As an investor in many asset classes, these are the three main reasons I switched from uninterested to quite bullish on Bitcoin early this year, and remain so today.</p><p> 因此，我既不是以任何价格购买比特币的永久公牛，也不是将其彻底抛弃的人。作为许多资产类别的投资者，这是我今年初从无兴趣转为对比特币相当看涨的三个主要原因，而今天仍然如此。</p><p>  Bitcoin is an open source peer-to-peer software monetary system invented by an anonymous person or group named Satoshi Nakamoto that can store and transmit value.</p><p>  比特币是一个匿名的人或中本聪（Satoshi Nakamoto）发明的一种开源对等软件货币系统，可以存储和传输价值。</p><p> It is decentralized; there is no singular authority that controls it, and instead it uses encryption based on blockchain technology, calculated by multiple parties on the network, to verify transactions and maintain the protocol. Incentives are given by the protocol to those that contribute computing power to verify transactions in the form of newly-“mined” coins, and/or transaction fees. In other words, by verifying and securing the blockchain, you earn some coins.</p><p> 它是分散的；没有一个单一的机构来控制它，而是使用基于区块链技术的加密技术（由网络上的多方计算）来验证交易并维护协议。协议将激励措施授予那些以新“挖出”的代币形式和/或交易费用来验证交易能力的计算机。换句话说，通过验证和保护区块链，您可以获得一些硬币。 </p><p> In the beginning, anyone with a decent computer could mine some coins. Now that many bitcoins have been mined and the market for mining coins has become very competitive, most people acquire coins simply by buying them from existing owners on exchanges and other platforms, while mining new coins is a specialized operation.</p><p>最初，拥有一台像样的计算机的人都可以开采一些硬币。现在已经开采了许多比特币，并且开采硬币的市场变得非常竞争，大多数人只是通过在交易所和其他平台上从现有所有者那里购买硬币来获取硬币，而开采新硬币是一种专门的操作。</p><p> Bitcoin’s protocol limits it to 21 million coins in total, which gives it scarcity, and therefore  potentially gives it value… if there is demand for it. There is no central authority that can unilaterally change that limit; Satoshi Nakamoto himself couldn’t add more coins to the Bitcoin protocol if he wanted to at this point. These coins are divisible into 100 million units each, like fractions of an ounce of gold.</p><p> 比特币的协议将其限制为总共2100万个硬币，这使它变得稀缺，因此有潜力赋予它价值……如果有需求的话。没有中央机构可以单方面更改该限制。中本聪本人目前无法在比特币协议中添加更多硬币。这些硬币可分为1亿个单位，就像一盎司黄金的分数一样。</p><p> For context, these “coins” aren’t “stored” on any device. Bitcoin is a distributed public ledger, and owners of Bitcoin can access and transmit their Bitcoin from one digital address to another digital address, as long as they have their private key, which unlocks their encrypted address. Owners store their private keys on devices, or even on paper or engraved in metal.</p><p> 就上下文而言，这些“硬币”不会“存储”在任何设备上。比特币是一种分布式的公共分类帐，并且比特币的所有者可以访问并将其比特币从一个数字地址传输到另一个数字地址，只要他们拥有自己的私钥即可解锁其加密地址。所有者将私钥存储在设备上，甚至存储在纸上或刻在金属上。</p><p> In fact, a private key can be stored as a seed phrase that can be remembered, and later reconstructed. You could literally commit your seed phrase to memory, destroy all devices that ever had your private key, go across an international border with nothing on your person, and then reconstruct your ability to access your Bitcoin with the memorized seed phrase later that week.</p><p> 实际上，私钥可以作为种子短语存储，可以记住并稍后进行重构。您可以从字面上将您的种子短语提交到内存中，销毁曾经拥有私钥的所有设备，跨越国际边界，而您本人却一无所获，然后在那周晚些时候使用记忆的种子短语来重建访问比特币的能力。</p><p>   As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties: – boring grey in colour – not a good conductor of electricity – not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either – not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose</p><p>   作为一项思想实验，可以想象有一种像金一样稀少但具有以下特性的贱金属：–无聊的灰色–不是良好的导电体–不是特别坚固，但是也不具有延展性或易于延展性–对任何其他金属都没有用实用或装饰性目的</p><p>  If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it.</p><p>  如果它出于某种原因以某种方式获得了任何价值，那么任何想长途转移财富的人都可以购买，转让和让接受者出售。</p><p> So, Bitcoin can be thought of as a rare digital commodity that has unique attributes. Although it has no industrial use, it is scarce, durable, portable, divisible, verifiable, storable, fungible, salable, and recognized across borders, and therefore has the properties of money. Like all “potential” money, though, it needs sustained demand to have value.</p><p> 因此，可以将比特币视为具有独特属性的稀有数字商品。尽管它没有工业用途，但它稀缺，耐用，便携，可分割，可验证，可存储，可替代，可出售且可跨国界识别，因此具有金钱属性。但是，像所有“潜在”货币一样，它需要持续的需求才能拥有价值。 </p><p> As of this writing, Bitcoin’s market capitalization is about $170 billion, or roughly the value of a large company. The total market capitalization of the entire cryptocurrency asset class is about $270 billion, including Bitcoin as the dominant share. Here’s Bitcoin’s market capitalization chart:</p><p>撰写本文时，比特币的市值约为1700亿美元，大约相当于一家大公司的价值。整个加密货币资产类别的总市值约为2700亿美元，其中以比特币为主要份额。这是比特币的市值图表：</p><p>  One of my concerns with Bitcoin back in 2017 was that, even if we grant that these digital commodity attributes are useful, and even if we acknowledge that the units of any cryptocurrency are scarce by design, anyone can now create a brand new cryptocurrency. Since Satoshi figured out the mathematical and software methods to create digital scarcity (based in part on previous work by others) and made that knowledge public, and thus solved the hard problems associated with it, any programmer and marketing team can now put together a new cryptocurrency.</p><p>  早在2017年，我对比特币的担忧之一就是，即使我们承认这些数字商品属性是有用的，并且即使我们承认设计中稀缺的任何加密货币的单位，任何人现在都可以创建一种全新的加密货币。由于Satoshi找出了造成数字稀缺的数学和软件方法（部分基于他人的过往工作）并公开了该知识，从而解决了与之相关的难题，因此任何程序员和营销团队现在都可以组建一个新的加密货币。</p><p> There are thousands of them, now that the floodgate of knowledge has been opened. Some of them are optimized for speed. Some of them are optimized for efficiency. Some of them can be used for programmed contracts, and so forth.</p><p> 现在，知识的闸门已经打开，其中有成千上万个。其中一些已针对速度进行了优化。其中一些已针对效率进行了优化。其中一些可用于程序化合同等。</p><p> So, rather than just one scarce “commodity” that has the unique property of being able to be transported over a network, there are thousands of similar commodities that have that new property. This risks the scarcity aspect of the commodity, and thus risks its value by potentially diluting it and dividing the community among multiple protocols. Each cryptocurrency is scarce, but there is no scarcity to the number of cryptocurrencies that can exist.</p><p> 因此，不仅有一种稀缺的“商品”具有能够通过网络进行传输的独特属性，还有成千上万的具有这种新属性的类似商品。这冒着商品稀缺性的风险，因此有可能通过稀释商品并将社区划分为多种协议而冒着其价值的风险。每种加密货币都很稀少，但是可以存在的加密货币数量并不稀缺。</p><p> This is unlike, say, gold and silver. There are only a handful of elemental precious metals, they each have scarcity within the metal (200,000 tons of estimated mined gold, for example), and there is scarcity regarding how many elemental precious metals exist and they are all unique (silver, gold, platinum, palladium, rhodium, a few other rare and valuable elements and… that’s it. Nature is not making more).</p><p> 例如，这不同于黄金和白银。仅有少数几种元素贵金属，它们在金属中都稀缺（例如，估计有20万吨估计开采的金），并且对于存在多少元素贵金属也很稀少，而且它们都是独一无二的（银，金，铂，钯，铑，其他一些稀有且有价值的元素……就是这样，自然不会增加更多）。</p><p> There is a ratio called “Bitcoin dominance” that measures what percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization that Bitcoin has. When Bitcoin was created, it was the only cryptocurrency and thus had 100% market share. Following the rise of Bitcoin, now there are thousands of different cryptocurrencies. First there was a trickle of them, and then it became a flood.</p><p> 有一个称为“比特币主导权”的比率，用于衡量比特币在总加密货币市值中所占的百分比。创建比特币时，它是唯一的加密货币，因此拥有100％的市场份额。随着比特币的兴起，现在有成千上万种不同的加密货币。首先是他们的细流，然后变成了洪水。</p><p> By the end of 2017, during that peak enthusiasm period for cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin’s market share briefly fell below 40%, even though it still remained the largest individual protocol. It has since risen back above 60% market share. Out of thousands of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin has nearly two thirds of all cryptocurrency market share.</p><p> 到2017年底，在加密货币的热情高峰期，尽管比特币仍然是最大的独立协议，但其市场份额一度跌至40％以下。从那以后，它已重新回到60％以上的市场份额。在数千种加密货币中，比特币占所有加密货币市场份额的近三分之二。 </p><p> So, what gives individual cryptocurrencies potential value, is their network effect, which in Bitcoin’s case is mainly derived from its first-mover advantage, which led to a security advantage.</p><p>因此，使单个加密货币具有潜在价值的是它们的网络效应，在比特币的情况下，这主要来自其先发优势，从而带来了安全优势。</p><p> An analogy is that a cryptocurrency is like a social network, except instead of being about self-expression, it’s about storing and transmitting value. It’s not hard to set up a new social network website; the code to do it is well understood at this point. Anyone can make one. However, creating the next Facebook (FB) or other billion-user network is a nearly impossible challenge, and a multi-billion-dollar reward awaits any team that somehow pulls it off.  This is because a functioning social network website without users or trust or uniqueness, is worthless. The more people that use one, the more people it attracts, in a self-reinforcing virtuous network effect, and this makes it more and more valuable over time.</p><p> 一个比喻是，加密货币就像一个社交网络，除了关于自我表达以外，它是关于存储和传递价值的。建立新的社交网络网站并不难；到目前为止，执行此操作的代码已经很清楚了。任何人都可以做到。但是，创建下一个Facebook（FB）或其他十亿用户网络几乎是不可能的挑战，数十亿美元的奖励正等待以某种方式实现的任何团队。这是因为没有用户，没有信任或没有唯一性的正常运作的社交网络网站是毫无价值的。在自我强化的良性网络效应中，使用一个的人越多，它吸引的人就越多，随着时间的推移，这将使其越来越有价值。</p><p> Similarly, ever since Satoshi solved the hard parts of digital scarcity and published the method for the world to see, it’s easy to make a new cryptocurrency. The nearly impossible part is to make one that is trusted, secure, and with sustained demand, which are all traits that Bitcoin has.</p><p> 同样，自从中本聪解决了数字稀缺的难题并发布了让全世界看到的方法之后，就很容易制造出一种新的加密货币。几乎不可能的部分是制造一个值得信赖，安全且具有持续需求的产品，而这正是比特币具有的所有特征。</p><p> When I analyzed cryptocurrencies in 2017, I was concerned with cryptocurrency market share dilution. Bitcoin’s market share was near its low point, and still falling. What if thousands of cryptocurrencies are created and used, and therefore none of them individually retain much value? Each one is scarce, but the total number of all of them is potentially infinite. Even if just ten protocols take off, that could pose a valuation problem. If the total cryptocurrency market capitalization grows to $1 trillion, but is equally-divided among the top ten protocols for example, then that would be just $100 billion in capitalization for each protocol.</p><p> 当我在2017年分析加密货币时，我担心加密货币市场份额稀释。比特币的市场份额已接近最低点，并且仍在下降。如果创建并使用了成千上万种加密货币，因此没有一个单独保留很多价值，该怎么办？每一个都是稀缺的，但是所有这些的总数可能是无限的。即使只有十个协议生效，这也可能带来估值问题。如果总的加密货币市值增长到1万亿美元，但例如在前十大协议中平均分配，那么每个协议的市值仅为1000亿美元。</p><p> In addition, there were some notable Bitcoin forks at the time, where Bitcoin Cash and subsequently Bitcoin Satoshi Vision were forked protocols of Bitcoin, that in theory could have split the community and market share. Ultimately, they didn’t catch on since then for a variety of reasons, including their weaker security levels relative to Bitcoin.</p><p> 此外，当时还有一些值得注意的比特币分叉，其中比特币现金和随后的比特币中本聪愿景是比特币的分叉协议，从理论上讲，这可以分裂社区和市场份额。最终，由于各种原因，它们从那时以来就没有流行，包括其相对于比特币的安全级别较弱。</p><p>  This reliance on the network effect is not unique to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Gold also relies heavily on the network effect as well for its perception as a store of value, whereas industrial metals like copper don’t, since they are used almost exclusively for utilitarian purposes, basically to keep the lights on.</p><p>  这种对网络效应的依赖并不是比特币或其他加密货币独有的。黄金在感知价值储存方面也非常依赖于网络效应，而铜等工业金属则几乎不使用，因为它们几乎仅用于功利目的，因此基本上可以保持照明。</p><p> Unlike Bitcoin, gold does have non-monetary industrial use, but only about 10% of its demand is industrial. The other 90% is based on bullion and jewelry demand, for which buyers view gold as a store of wealth, or a display of beauty and wealth, because it happens to have very good properties for it in the sense that it looks nice, doesn’t rust, is very rare, holds a lot of value in a small space, is divisible, lasts forever, and so forth. If gold’s demand for jewelry, coinage, and bars were to ever decrease substantially and structurally, leaving its practical industrial usage as its primary demand, the existing supply/demand balance would be thrown out and this would likely result in a much lower price.</p><p> 与比特币不同，黄金确实具有非货币工业用途，但其需求中只有约10％是工业用途。其余的90％是基于金银和珠宝的需求，购买者将其视为黄金的财富储存或美丽与财富的展示，因为从它看起来不错的角度来看，黄金恰好具有很好的性能，生锈是非常罕见的，它在很小的空间内具有很大的价值，可以被分割，可以永久存在，等等。如果黄金对珠宝，造币和金条的需求从结构上大幅下降，而将其实际的工业用途作为其主要需求，那么现有的供求平衡将被淘汰，这可能会导致价格大大降低。 </p><p> In the West, interest in gold bullion has gradually declined somewhat over decades, while demand from the East for storing wealth has been strong. I suspect the 2020’s decade, due to monetary and fiscal policy, could renew western interest in gold, but we’ll see.</p><p>在西方，对金条的兴趣在过去几十年中逐渐下降，而东方对储存财富的需求却很强劲。我怀疑由于货币和财政政策的原因，2020年可能会重新激发西方对黄金的兴趣，但我们会看到。</p><p> So, the argument that Bitcoin isn’t like gold because it can’t be used for anything other than money, doesn’t really hold up. Or more specifically, it’s about 10% true, referring to gold’s 10% industrial demand. With 90% of gold’s demand coming from jewelry and bullion usage, which are based on perception and sentiment and fashion (all for good reason, based on gold’s unique properties), gold would have similar problems to Bitcoin if there was ever a widespread loss of interest in it as a store of value and display of wealth.</p><p> 因此，关于比特币不像黄金，因为除了金钱以外，它不能用于其他任何用途的说法并没有真正成立。或更确切地说，大约是10％的真实值，是指黄金的10％工业需求。黄金的需求中有90％来自珠宝和金银的使用，而黄金和珠宝的使用是基于感知，情感和时尚（所有这些都是有充分的理由，基于黄金的独特特性），因此，如果黄金的广泛亏损，黄金将面临与比特币类似的问题。对它的兴趣是作为价值的存储和财富的显示。</p><p> Of course, gold’s advantage is that it has thousands of years of international history as money, in addition to its properties that make it suitable for money, so the risk of it losing that perception is low, making it historically an extremely reliable store of value with less upside and less downside risk, but not inherently all that different.</p><p> 当然，黄金的优势在于，除了具有使其适合于货币的特性外，它还具有数千年的国际货币历史，因此其失去这种感知的风险也很低，从而使其在历史上成为极其可靠的价值存储库。具有更少的上升空间和更少的下降风险，但本质上并没有那么大的不同。</p><p> The difference is mainly that Bitcoin is newer and with a smaller market capitalization, with more explosive upside and downside potential. And as the next section explains, a cryptocurrency’s security is tied to its network effect, unlike precious metals.</p><p> 区别主要在于比特币是更新的，市值较小，具有更大的上升和下降潜力。正如下一节所述，与贵金属不同，加密货币的安全性与其网络效应息息相关。</p><p>  A cryptocurrency’s security is tied to its network effect, and specifically tied to the market capitalization that the cryptocurrency has. If the network is weak, a group with enough computing power could potentially override all other participants on the network, and take control of the blockchain ledger. Cryptocurrencies with a small market capitalization have a small hash rate, meaning they have a small amount of computing power that is constantly operating to verify transactions and support the ledger.</p><p>  加密货币的安全性与其网络效应有关，特别是与该加密货币所具有的市值有关。如果网络薄弱，则具有足够计算能力的组可能会覆盖网络上的所有其他参与者，并控制区块链分类帐。市值较小的加密货币的哈希率较小，这意味着它们具有少量的计算能力，这些能力会不断运行以验证交易并支持分类帐。</p><p> Bitcoin, on the other hand, has so many devices verifying the network that they collectively consume more electricity per year than a small country, like Greece or Switzerland. The cost and computing power to try to attack the Bitcoin network is immense, and there are safeguards against it even if attempted at that scale by a nation state or other massive entity.</p><p> 另一方面，比特币拥有太多验证网络的设备，因此与希腊或瑞士这样的小国相比，它们每年合计消耗的电量更多。试图攻击比特币网络的成本和计算能力是巨大的，即使有一个民族国家或其他大型实体试图以这种规模进行攻击，也存在防范措施。</p><p> Any news story you have ever heard about Bitcoin being hacked or stolen, was not about Bitcoin’s protocol itself, which has never been hacked. Instead, instances of Bitcoin hacks and theft involve perpetrators breaking into systems to steal the private keys that are held there, often with lackluster security systems. If a hacker gets someone’s private keys, they can access that person’s Bitcoin holdings. This risk can be avoided by using robust security practices, such as keeping private keys in cold storage.</p><p> 您从未听说过有关比特币被黑客入侵或被盗的任何新闻报道，都与比特币的协议本身无关，后者从未被黑客入侵。取而代之的是，比特币被黑客入侵和盗窃的实例涉及作案者闯入系统，以窃取保存在其中的私钥，而这些系统通常都缺乏安全性。如果黑客获得某人的私钥，则他们可以访问该人的比特币资产。通过使用可靠的安全做法（例如将私钥保存在冷存储中）可以避免这种风险。 </p><p> The rise of quantum computers could eventually pose an actual security threat to Bitcoin’s encryption, where private keys could be determined from public keys, but there are already known methods that the Bitcoin protocol can adopt when necessary in order to become more quantum resilient, since the blockchain can be updated when there is broad consensus among participants.</p><p>量子计算机的兴起最终可能对比特币的加密构成实际的安全威胁，在这种威胁下，私钥可以从公钥中确定，但是比特币协议已经有必要在必要时采用的已知方法，以使其具有更大的量子弹性，因为当参与者之间达成广泛共识时，可以更新区块链。</p><p> Bitcoin’s programmed difficulty for verifying transactions is automatically updated every two weeks, and it seeks the optimal point of profitability and security. In other words, the difficulty of the puzzle to add new blocks to the blockchain is automatically tuned up or down depending on how efficiently miners as a whole are solving those puzzles.</p><p> 比特币为验证交易而设定的难度每两周自动更新一次，以寻求最佳的盈利能力和安全性。换句话说，根据矿工整体解决这些难题的效率，可以自动调高或调低将难题添​​加到区块链的难度。</p><p> If Bitcoin becomes too unprofitable to mine (meaning the price falls below the cost of hardware and electricity to verify transactions and mine it), then fewer companies will mine it, and the rate of new block creation will lag its intended speed as computational power gradually falls off the network. An automatic difficulty adjustment will occur, making it require less computational power to verify transactions and mine new coins, which reduces security but is necessary to make sure that miners don’t get priced out of maintaining the network.</p><p> 如果比特币变得太无利可图（意味着价格跌破硬件和电力成本以验证交易并进行挖掘），那么将有更少的公司进行挖掘，并且随着计算能力的逐步提高，新区块的创建速度将落在其预期的速度之上。从网络掉线。会自动进行难度调整，以减少核实交易和挖掘新硬币所需的计算能力，从而降低了安全性，但必须确保矿工不会因维护网络而承受沉重代价。</p><p> On the other hand, if Bitcoin becomes extremely profitable to mine (meaning the price is way above the cost of hardware and electricity to mine it), then more people will mine it, and the rate of new block creation will surpass its intended speed as more and more computational power is added to the network. An automatic difficulty adjustment will occur, making it require more computational power to verify transactions and mine new coins, which increases security of the network.</p><p> 另一方面，如果比特币的开采变得极其有利可图（意味着价格远高于开采它的硬件和电力成本），那么会有更多的人进行开采，而新区块的创建速度将超过预期的速度。越来越多的计算能力被添加到网络中。将自动进行难度调整，从而需要更多的计算能力来验证交易和挖掘新硬币，从而提高了网络的安全性。</p><p> More often than not, the latter occurs, so Bitcoin’s difficulty has gone up exponentially over time, which makes its network more and more secure.</p><p> 后者经常发生，所以比特币的难度随着时间的流逝呈指数上升，这使得其网络越来越安全。</p><p> Even if a demonstrably superior cryptocurrency to Bitcoin came around (and some users argue that some of the existing protocols are already superior in many ways, based on speed or efficiency or extra features), that superior cryptocurrency would still find it nearly impossible to catch up with Bitcoin’s security lead in terms of hash rate. Simply by coming later and thus having weaker security due to a weaker network effect, they have an in-built inferiority to Bitcoin on that particular metric, and for a store of value, security is the most important metric. The fact that Bitcoin came first, is something that can’t be replicated unless the community around it somehow stumbles very badly and allows other cryptocurrencies to catch up. The gap, though, is quite wide.</p><p> 即使出现了比比特币明显优越的加密货币（有些用户认为，基于速度，效率或额外功能，一些现有协议已经在许多方面都具有优越性），但这种优越的加密货币仍然几乎无法追上在哈希率方面，比特币的安全性领先。只是稍后再来，由于网络效应较弱而使安全性较弱，因此它们在该特定度量标准上比比特币具有固有的劣势，对于价值存储而言，安全性是最重要的度量标准。比特币排在第一位的事实是不可复制的，除非围绕它的社区以某种方式严重失败并允许其他加密货币赶上来。但是，差距还是很大的。</p><p> An investment or speculation in a cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin, is an investment or speculation in that cryptocurrency’s network effect. Its network effect is its ability to retain and grow its user-base and market capitalization, and by extension its ability to secure its transactions against potential attacks.</p><p> 对加密货币（尤其是比特币）的投资或投机，是​​对该加密货币的网络效应的投资或投机。它的网络效应是保留和扩大用户群和​​市值的能力，以及扩展其保护交易不受潜在攻击的能力的能力。 </p><p>  Since my 2017 analysis when I was somewhat concerned with market share dilution, Bitcoin has stabilized and strengthened its market share.</p><p>自从我在2017年进行分析时，我有点担心市场份额稀释，比特币已经稳定并增强了其市场份额。</p><p> The semi-popular forks did not harm it, and thousands of other coins did not continue to dilute it. It has by far the best security and leading adoption of all cryptocurrencies, cementing its role as the digital gold of the cryptocurrency market.</p><p> 半受欢迎的叉子并没有伤害它，成千上万的其他硬币没有继续稀释它。到目前为止，它具有所有加密货币中最好的安全性和领先的采用率，巩固了其作为加密货币市场数字黄金的作用。</p><p> Compared to its 2017 low point of under 40% cryptocurrency market share, Bitcoin is back to over 60% market share.</p><p> 与2017年低于40％的加密货币市场份额的低点相比，比特币已回到60％以上的市场份额。</p><p> There is a whole ecosystem built around Bitcoin, including specialist banks that borrow and lend it with interest. Many platforms allow users to trade or speculate in multiple cryptocurrencies, like Coinbase and Kraken, but there is an increasing number of platforms like Cash App and Swan Bitcoin that enable users to buy Bitcoin, but not other cryptocurrencies.</p><p> 围绕比特币建立了一个完整的生态系统，其中包括专门向其借贷的专业银行。许多平台允许用户在多种加密货币中进行交易或投机，例如Coinbase和Kraken，但是越来越多的平台（例如Cash App和Swan Bitcoin）使用户能够购买比特币，但不能购买其他加密货币。</p><p> The ongoing stability of Bitcoin’s network effect is one of the reasons I became more optimistic about Bitcoin’s prospects going forward. Rather than quickly fall to upstart competitors like Myspace did to Facebook, Bitcoin has retained substantial market share, and especially hash rate, against thousands of cryptocurrency competitors for a decade now.</p><p> 比特币网络效应的持续稳定性是我对比特币的前景变得更加乐观的原因之一。比特币并没有像Myspace在Facebook上那样迅速沦为暴发户，而是保持了相当大的市场份额，尤其是哈希率，与十年前成千上万的加密货币竞争对手相比。</p><p> Currencies tends to have winner-take-most phenomena. They live or die by their demand and network effects, especially in terms of international recognition. Cryptocurrencies so far appear to be the same, where a few big winners take most of the market share and have most of the security, especially Bitcoin, and most of the other 5,000+ don’t matter. Some of them, of</p><p> 货币往往具有赢家占多数的现象。他们的生存和死亡取决于他们的需求和网络效应，尤其是在国际认可方面。到目前为止，加密货币似乎是相同的，一些大赢家占据了大部分市场份额，并且拥有大部分安全性，尤其是比特币，而其他5,000多个中的大多数都不重要。其中一些</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.lynalden.com/invest-in-bitcoin/">https://www.lynalden.com/invest-in-bitcoin/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/2020/">#2020</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/比特币/">#比特币</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/投资/">#投资</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/investing/">#investing</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/货币/">#货币</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
