This feature is designed to give users an additional layer of privacy by ensuring that no one can view the websites that they visit.\n Now, in addition to some carriers in Europe, it appears that T-Mobile/Sprint in the United States is also blocking iCloud Private Relay access when connected to cellular data.\n  Apple says that Private Relay is a feature designed to give users another layer of privacy when browsing the web. The first relay is sent through a server maintained by Apple, and the second is a third-party operator.\u00a0The feature was announced at WWDC last June and initially slated for inclusion in iOS 15.\n Apple ultimately shipped the feature as a \u201cpublic beta,\u201d meaning that it is disabled by default in the newest iOS 15 and macOS Monterey releases. You can manually enable it by going to Settings on your iPhone, tapping your name at the top, choosing iCloud, and choosing \u201cPrivate Relay.\u201d\n T-Mobile was among the carriers in Europe that signed an open letter expressing concern about the impact of Private Relay. The carriers wrote that the feature cuts off networks and servers from accessing \u201cvital network data and metadata and could impact \u201coperator\u2019s ability to efficiently manage telecommunication networks.\u201d\n In the UK, carriers including T-Mobile, EE, and others have already started blocking Private Relay usage when connected to cellular data.  9to5Mac has also now confirmed that T-Mobile is extending this policy to the United States.\n This means that T-Mobile and Sprint users in the United States can no longer use the privacy-preserving iCloud Private Relay feature when connected to cellular data. An error message in the Settings app explains:\n Your cellular plan doesn\u2019t support iCloud Private Relay. With Private Relay turned off, this network can monitor your internet activity, and your IP address is not hidden from known trackers or websites.\n The change does not appear to be network-wide just yet, but rather it appears T-Mobile is in the process of rolling it out. This means that some users might still be able to use iCloud Private Relay when connected to their cellular network \u2013\u00a0at least for now. The situation could also could vary based on your location or plan.\n Apple has yet to comment on this situation, but it is worrisome to see carriers like T-Mobile interfering with system-level iOS features. There\u2019s likely not much that Apple can do here, but it underscores another limitation of Private Relay as a feature as well as the power that carriers hold.\n @9to5mac Looks like  @TMobile USA is also blocking  #icloud Public Relay.

This flowering cultivar of the Callery pear (  Pyrus calleryana) was bred to be thorn-less and sterile. We thought it could not reproduce.\n    We soon found out that the flowers stink, but it took a few years to discover the trees are brittle. The Bradford cultivar breaks in storms.\n  So horticulturists went back to the lab to create stronger cultivars  including \u2018Aristocrat\u2019, \u2018Autumn Blaze\u2019, \u2018Capital\u2019, \u2018Chanticleer\u2019 (also known as \u2018Cleveland Select\u2019), \u2018New Bradford\u2019, \u2018Redspire\u2019, and \u2018Whitehouse. The tree was poised to become invasive.\n It took a while to realize that different sterile cultivars within the reach of the same pollinating insect could cross pollinate and produce fertile fruit. The seed is a hybrid of hybrids. Birds eat the fruit and transport the seeds.\n  Pyrus calleryana spreads prolifically now by seeds and roots in old fields, roadsides and disturbed soil. The invasive trees are not noticeable until early spring when they bloom before our native white-flowering trees:  chokecherry,  downy serviceberry (shadbush), and  hawthorn.\n  It\u2019s gone wild in 25 states and is listed as invasive in 14. In July 2021 South Carolina banned   Pyrus calleryana sale and cultivation with enforcement phased in by October 2024.\n  In November 2021 the  PA Department of Agriculture added Callery pear ( Pyrus calleryana) to the state\u2019s list of Noxious Weeds. It cannot be legally sold or cultivated in our state though you may see it in nurseries while enforcement is phased in through February 2024.\n  In the meantime, if you are offered a Callery pear cultivar as a landscaping choice, don\u2019t buy it.\n  ( fruit photo by Kate St. John, remaining photos and map from bugwood; click on the captions to see the originals)\n p.s.

"note_en": "It\u2019s a new year, and I\u2019ve decided it\u2019s a good time to replace myself as the CEO of Signal. I have now been working on Signal for almost a decade. It has always been my goal for Signal to grow and sustain beyond my involvement, but four years ago that would still not have been possible. I was writing all the Android code, was writing all of the server code, was the only person on call for the service, was facilitating all product development, and was managing everyone. I couldn\u2019t ever leave cell service, had to take my laptop with me everywhere in case of emergencies, and occasionally found myself sitting alone on the sidewalk in the rain late at night trying to diagnose a service degradation. I\u2019ve spent the past four years endeavouring to change that, and today the picture is radically different. Signal is now an amazing group of 30 people: a mix of wonderful engineers, super talented designers, gifted and unflappable support staff, and a very accomplished and committed leadership team. I rarely write code anymore, and if I do it\u2019s in a minor role. I am not tempting fate by leaving cell service, no single person is ever perpetually on call, and hopefully nobody at Signal will ever find themselves sitting on the sidewalk with their laptop in the rain again (unless that happens to be your preferred remote work setup). We have a great leadership team that is facilitating product development, managing the organization, and pushing the technology forward. Most importantly, the values and the mission that Signal was built on are embedded in the whole of the organization, and everyone involved is here to honor them and see them through. Simultaneously, Signal has grown in adoption and popularity around the world even faster than I imagined. People increasingly find value and peace of mind in Signal (technology built for them instead of for their data), and  are increasingly willing to sustain it. Every day, I\u2019m struck by how boundless Signal\u2019s potential looks, and I want to bring in someone with fresh energy and commitment to make the most of that. In other words, after a decade or more, it\u2019s difficult to overstate how important Signal is to me, but I now feel very comfortable replacing myself as CEO based on the team we have, and also believe that it is an important step for expanding on Signal\u2019s success. I\u2019ve been talking with candidates over the last few months, but want to open up the search with this announcement in order to help find the best person for the next decade of Signal. Please get in touch if that might be you! I will continue to remain on the Signal board, committed to helping manifest Signal\u2019s mission from that role, and I will be transitioning out as CEO over the next month in order to focus on the candidate search. Brian Acton, who is also on the Signal Foundation board, has volunteered to serve as interim CEO during the search period. I have every confidence in his commitment to the mission and ability to facilitate the team for this time. Finally, thank you to everyone who has helped make Signal what it is, has been supportive of what we\u2019re building, and has been there along the way. We already have so much exciting work that\u2019s coming soon in the pipeline right now, and I\u2019m optimistic about all the potential for Signal over the next decade.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 03:24:32", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u9996\u5e2d,year,\u4fe1\u53f7", "title": "\u65b0\u5e74\uff0c\u65b0\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98", "title_en": "New Year, New CEO", "transed": 1, "url": "https://signal.org/blog/new-year-new-ceo/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9996\u5e2d", "year", "\u4fe1\u53f7"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072661, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5305\u62ec\u8036\u9c81\u5927\u5b66\uff0c\u4e54\u6cbb\u57ce\u5927\u5b66\u548c\u897f\u5317\u5927\u5b66\u5728\u5185\u7684\u5341\u516d\u6b21\u4e3b\u8981\u7f8e\u56fd\u5927\u5b66\u6b63\u5728\u4e3a\u6d89\u5acc\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u8fdd\u89c4\u800c\u88ab\u8d77\u8bc9\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u5171\u540c\u52aa\u529b\u786e\u5b9a\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u63f4\u52a9\u5956\u3002\n\u60a8\u5c06\u6536\u53d6$ +\u7a0e\u7387\uff08\u5982\u9002\u7528\uff09\u4e3a\u534e\u5c14\u8857\u65e5\u8bb0\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u6539\u5e10\u5355\u504f\u597d\u6216\u81f4\u7535\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u60a8\u5c06\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u66f4\u6539\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u6216\u6761\u6b3e\u63d0\u524d\u901a\u77e5\u60a8\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u7528\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u6765\u53d6\u6d88\u8ba2\u9605\u3002", "note_en": "Sixteen major U.S. universities, including Yale University, Georgetown University and Northwestern University, are being sued for alleged antitrust violations because of the way they work together to determine financial-aid awards for students.\n  According to a lawsuit filed in Illinois federal court late Sunday by law firms representing five former students who attended some of the schools, the universities engaged in price fixing and unfairly limited aid by using a shared methodology\u00a0to calculate applicants\u2019 financial need.

In spring 2020, many Republicans, including President Donald Trump, insisted that COVID was hardly worse than the flu; that its fatality risk was comparable to an everyday activity, like driving in a car; and that an obsessive focus on cases wouldn\u2019t give an accurate picture of what was going on in the pandemic.\n In the current Omicron wave, these Republican talking points seem to have mostly come true\u2014for most  vaccinated  non-senior adults, who are  disproportionately Democrats.\n But Democratic talking points about the severity of COVID and the need for commensurate caution remain valid and not only for the sick and elderly. Ironically, they are especially true for the unvaccinated\u2014a  disproportionately Republican group that has seen their hospitalization rates soar this winter to all-time highs. About 9,000 Americans are dying of COVID every week. Preliminary state data  suggest that more than 90 percent of today\u2019s deaths are still among unvaccinated people. This year, COVID is on pace to kill  more than 300,000 unvaccinated people who would, quite likely, avoid death by getting two or three shots.\n  The messiness of Omicron data\u2014record-high cases! but much milder illness!\u2014has deepened our COVID   Rashomon, in which different communities are telling themselves different stories about what\u2019s going on, and coming to different conclusions about how to lead their lives. That\u2019s true even within populations that, a year ago, were united in their desire to take the pandemic seriously and were outraged by those who refused to do so.\n A virus that seems both pervasive and mild offers an opening to people who are, let\u2019s call them, \u201cvaxxed and done.\u201d The attitude of the VADs is this:\n For more than a year, I did everything that public-health authorities told me to do. I wore masks. I canceled vacations. I made sacrifices. I got vaccinated. I got boosted. I\u2019m happy to get boosted again. But this virus doesn\u2019t stop. Year over year, the infections don\u2019t decrease. Instead,  virulence for people like me is decreasing, either because the virus is changing, or because of growing population immunity, or both. Americans should stop pointlessly guilting themselves about all these cases. In the past week,  daily confirmed COVID cases per capita were higher than the U.S. in Ireland, Greece, Iceland, Denmark, France, the U.K., Spain, Portugal, Italy, Switzerland, and even Australia, one of the most COVID-cautious countries in the world. As the coronavirus continues its unstoppable march toward endemicity, our attitude toward the virus should follow a similar path toward stoicism. COVID is becoming something like the seasonal flu for most people who keep up with their shots, so I\u2019m prepared to treat this like I\u2019ve treated the flu: by basically not worrying about it and living my life normally.\n It\u2019s hard to put a number on how many people are in this group, but we have some hard data to prove that their ranks are growing. This past December, airports processed  twice as many travelers compared with the same period in 2020, despite many flights being canceled. On several days, TSA-checkpoint numbers exceeded their totals from pre-pandemic 2019. This is not the picture of a country that is hunkering down for Omicron. It is the limited snapshot of a mostly vaccinated population with millions of people who are eager to move on.\n I have a lot of sympathy for this group\u2019s case, especially as it relates to schools. The risk of COVID to vaccinated teachers  and even unvaccinated students seems lower than we initially thought. Meanwhile, the costs of remote schooling seem  higher than we feared. The White House and Education Secretary Miguel Cardona have come out strongly in support of keeping schools open. Other Democratic leaders, like Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, are fighting reluctant teachers to keep school in person. Even among pro-vaccine Americans, a growing number of people seem to be saying they are done with remote school as a baseline COVID policy.\n But there is an opposing group. Let\u2019s call them the \u201cvaxxed and cautious.\u201d Here\u2019s my best summary of their perspective:\n Why on earth would we suddenly relax measures   now, during the largest statistical wave of COVID ever recorded in the U.S.? We shouldn\u2019t treat Omicron like any old seasonal flu, because it\u2019s not like any old seasonal flu. It\u2019s likely deadlier for those without immunity and almost certainly several times more transmissible for everybody else. We have no idea what the effects of Omicron on long COVID will be, but  evidence of  lingering symptoms should make us wary of just letting tens of millions of people get needlessly infected. Moreover, the health-care system is  already worn down and at risk of being overloaded. Record-high caseloads are societally debilitating, creating long chains of infections that are bound to reach some immunocompromised people and the elderly, thus causing needless death. For all these reasons, we should take individual measures to throttle the spread of this virus.\n If you feel a bit torn between these ideologies, I understand. I\u2019m a bit torn myself.\n  In the past few weeks, several people have told me that they feel extremely safe personally but remain worried about passing along the virus to vulnerable people in their networks. So what should they do? This is not a problem with an easy answer, because the gap between individual risk and societal risk in this pandemic has never been wider. The risk of death from Omicron for boosted, healthy adults under 50 seems to be somewhere between that of riding a bike and going on an airplane. In isolation, this statistic makes the vaxxed-and-done perspective a no-brainer: Nobody consults the CDC website to decide if it\u2019s safe to bike down the street.\n But a pandemic is more than the sum of individual healthy-adult experiences. Viruses are  societal multiplication problems. When a double-digit share of a public-school system comes down with Omicron, school is out, and the effects ripple through local families. When a double-digit share of a medical system comes down with Omicron, doctor and nurse availability plummets, and the effect ripples through the hospital. With workers out across industries, entire cities stop functioning. In Washington, D.C., last week, some schools had to delay opening not because of the virus but because snowplows couldn\u2019t make the roads safe enough to get there\u2014too many snowplow drivers were out sick.\n My synthesis view is that we should start with the obvious. If I were COVID czar, my rules for early 2022 would be to try desperately to keep schools open and in person, follow through on  vaccine mandates for nursing homes, distribute free rapid tests to allow people to identify their own infectiousness when they mix households with vulnerable people, and expand vaccine PSA programs, since the vaccines seem by far the most effective intervention against the virus.

Most often the answers to the questions come back to a central theme \u2013 because that\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been done. To that I say, \u201cYes, I know this is the way it\u2019s always been done\u2014but is there a better way?\u201d\n Let\u2019s question everything. From our questions can flow incredible things \u2014 ideas that seem a bit ridiculous \u2026 until they become common. Questions like: if we worked less, could we actually be more effective and productive? If we approached our work differently, could we be better outside of work?\n I think it\u2019s important to ask questions in all parts of our lives and work. It\u2019s useful to look at something that have been done one way for so long that it\u2019s become a default, and then shift it slightly, just to see what happens \u2014 and to see what might improve.\n That\u2019s the motivation behind our company\u2019s experiment with a four-day workweek. We\u2019re turning Fridays into something more like Saturdays or Sundays \u2014 genuine time off, with no planned meetings or work. Our Board, Leadership Team, and People Ops team have been supportive, and we\u2019re eager to see how the pilot goes.\n What\u2019s the rationale? Work is changing and the biggest obstacle we have to face is burnout. It\u2019s why we launched  Conscious.org, a place to catalog all the future of work experiments that we\u2019ve embraced and used to improve our internal culture.\n The four day workweek speaks to a shift in people\u2019s working styles \u2014 namely, that if you can get your work completed from Monday to Thursday, then there should be no latent expectation that Friday is time on. Instead, it can be time off \u2014 a period to rest, recover, engage with loved ones, think creatively and all the other things that enliven us.\n Here\u2019s what many of us know but can be tough to admit: Work will fill the space you give to it. My bet is that we\u2019re going to become vastly more efficient from Monday to Thursday. We\u2019ll trim those excess meetings; we won\u2019t send unnecessary communications. Because we\u2019ll have less time, we\u2019ll get more concrete work done.\n As with everything we do at Bolt, this is an experiment. To that end, we\u2019re encouraging employees to set the following out-of-office email notification of Fridays: \u201cI\u2019m out of the office today because we\u2019re working consciously here at Bolt and are currently testing out a four-day workweek. I\u2019ll be back in touch with you on [Monday].\u201d We\u2019ll be tracking our successes and failures closely\u2014and, in the tradition of  Conscious.org, sharing them publicly.\n Is this a way to do the workweek better? I think so, but we\u2019re testing the hypothesis and doing so with an organization that has big goals, a growing team, and a lot on the line. We\u2019ll keep you all updated as this moves forward, and we look forward to letting you know how we do.\n Check out   Fast Company\u2019s article  on how Bolt is the first tech unicorn to shift to a four-day workweek.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 03:12:14", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "day", "title": "\u5207\u6362\u5230\u4e3a\u671f\u56db\u5929\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5468", "title_en": "Switching to a four-day workweek", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.bolt.com/blog/switching-four-day-workweek/#", "via": "", "real_tags": ["day"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e9a77ae47790d803d19b65c1b33b4ea7.png", "infoid": 1072658, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u662f21\u4e16\u7eaa\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002\u4f46\u5b83\u771f\u6b63\u6709\u6548\u5417\uff1f\u83b7\u5f97\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5efa\u7acb\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u81ea\u5df1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u6211\u4e70\u4e86\u4e24\u5757160\u74e6\u7684\u9762\u677f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9633\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b89\u88c5\u5b83\u4eec\u3002\u60a8\u5c06\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\u770b\u5230\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u8be6\u7ec6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "note_en": "Using renewable energy is a popular trend in the 21st century.

When a company is accepted into the YC batch program, we now invest a total of $500,000. We still invest $125,000 for 7% and now also invest an additional $375,000 on an uncapped safe with an MFN  1.\n This is the type of deal that we have wanted to offer YC founders for years \u2014 and with the recent success of YC companies, including ten IPOs in 2021 and more to come this year, we are now able to do so. This sum will enable founders to focus on launching, building, and scaling their company. It will remove the immediate pressure to fundraise and accept less than favorable terms.\n Incidentally, we also hope that this deal will encourage more founders of any age and from every demographic group and geographic location to take the leap into the startup world, apply to YC, and build their own successful startup.\n Dalton Caldwell, YC\u2019s Managing Director, Architect, and long-term Group Partner, who first suggested that now was the right time to make this change, also pointed out that if founders stay lean, this is more than enough capital to survive for years, regardless of the economic environment.\n Our  founding principles state that YC\u2019s value is \u201cthe number of startups we help times how much we help them.\u201d More startups in the world is a good thing \u2014 and for the founders of those startups, we\u2019re always iterating to improve our program. This terrific deal will make it even more likely that they find product market fit, raise a successful seed round, and build a world-changing technology company.\n  1 The $375,000 is on an uncapped safe with \u201cMost Favored Nation\u201d (MFN) terms. MFN means that this safe will take on the terms of the lowest cap safe (or other most favorable terms) that is issued between the start of the batch and the next equity round. Simply put, we\u2019re giving the company money now but at terms you\u2019ll negotiate with future investors.  \u21a9", "posttime": "2022-01-11 03:10:44", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

"note_en": "The Ladies of iFixit have earned 1 million in  reputation! This collective milestone is thanks to a wonderful group of women fixers, each of whom contribute to iFixit\u2019s community by finding solutions to repair-related problems.\n So who are the Ladies of iFixit? We are comprised of  51 members, who together and over a significant period of time have authored or contributed to 3,000  repair guides and provided 486 solutions to the repair community. Our ladies are from different departments (and countries), but we are not pigeonholed by our positions or titles\u2014all of us can fix.\n We share whatever knowledge we have, be it by answering questions on our  Answers Forum, creating a guide, or improving the knowledge base by editing existing guides and tackling unanswered questions.\n  Our resident guidekeeper and orphan slayer (trust us, it\u2019s nicer than it sounds),  Sam Goldheart makes up the bulk of our 1 million achievement, with 443K in reputation, 108 solutions, and 2,287 guides authored or edited. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I made one [guide], but I love that they\u2019re still helping people out every day,\u201d Sam said. \u201cGetting comments on those guides always makes my day.\u201d These days, she considers herself a \u201clead-tech-writer-turned-blog-writer,\u201d who does a little bit of everything around the iFixit office. And while she isn\u2019t exclusively writing guides anymore, the Internet still reaps the benefits of her meticulous instructions.\n One fixer  saved over $400 thanks to a Goldheart guide. Another praised her  attention to detail in providing accurate screw sizes and emphasizing necessary precautions to avoid accidents. \u201cIt was hard work to make those guides, but the investment super paid-off,\u201d Sam said. \u201cAs an Easter egg, readers can look up my very first guide, one I made before I was hired. It\u2019s pretty bad!\u201d\n  Sam\u2019s candor speaks to the core of the iFixit philosophy. Even if you write a \u201cpretty bad guide\u201d when you\u2019re starting out, at least you\u2019re sharing what you know. With enough patience and curiosity, you can hone your skills, grow your confidence, and fix more things. And that\u2019s what we are all about here!\n Our Japanese Localization Lead,  Midori Doi started working at iFixit just before the iFixit Japanese website launched. At the time, iFixit was known in Japan more for our iPhone teardowns than for our repair guides. And while thousands of English language repair guides were available on the iFixit website, none were available in Japanese.\n  \u201cWhen I started the translation work I felt as though I was walking through a vast desert all alone. However, over the past six years, thanks to the massive help of so many volunteers and repair lovers from around the world, the translation work has advanced tremendously and the Japanese pages have been greatly enriched,\u201d Midori said.\n Her passion for repair has its roots in the popular Japanese expression, \u201c mottainai!\u201d which means, \u201cwhat a waste!\u201d Midori says this expression is passed on from generation to generation to remind us about the importance of minimizing waste. \u201cWe have been using an old washing machine for more than 10 years\u2026we have done a few simple repairs along the way to keep it working\u2026I think about the money we have saved by repairing our machine with parts that cost a total of $50,\u201d Midori said.\n  Midori once demonstrated how anyone can do repairs on the spot, next to  CEO Kyle Wiens. Just before a talk about iFixit product design and e-waste at a Super Science High School in Tokyo, her MacBook Pro\u2019s hard drive cable stopped working. Wiens suggested they repair the laptop during the presentation. \u201cMy hands got sweaty, as I had never done a computer repair,\u201d Midori said. \u201cFollowing the instructions from the iFixit repair guide, and with Kyle\u2019s guidance, I was able to successfully replace the part\u2014and it took only 15 minutes!\u201d\n That unplanned, live demonstration showed students that anyone can do repairs. Midori\u2019s commitment to growing the Japanese repair community, and shifting the collective mindset from replace to repair, has garnered her 202K in reputation. \u201cTake it from this repair amateur, you do NOT need to be a technological whiz/professional in order to do repairs. And the more you do repair, the better you will get at it,\u201d Midori said.\n Many Ladies of iFixit have been repairing things for a long time, before fully realizing its environmental and intellectual benefits. iFixit\u2019s Community Manager,  Amber Taus, has always been interested in how things work.\n  \u201cWhen I was 4, I took the case off our VCR, and I would sit and watch the tapes play while everyone else watched the movie,\u201d said Taus. The majority of her reputation is actually on our  Meta site, rather than on the  Answers Forum or through  guide making. Meta is a dedicated space for fixers to talk about iFixit. There, Taus has fostered an open environment, where she connects with our volunteer moderators and community members who are seeking answers related to iFixit itself.\n Amber\u2019s unique position in managing both communities has earned her significant reputation since starting at iFixit earlier this year. On Meta she\u2019s earned 3,177 in reputation and provided 164 solutions; on iFixit, she\u2019s earned 2,864 in reputation and provided 35 solutions. Taus takes time out of her day to look around the site and enjoy content that predated her arrival.\n  \u201cMy favorite guide is a  teardown of an orange. It\u2019s so funny and there was so much attention to detail,\u201d Amber said. \u201cThe  final step with the components of the orange laid out is just so  beautiful.\u201d Humor aside, Amber insists that the best guides are the ones that are easy to follow and that make a repairer feel comfortable, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it wasn\u2019t normal for people to take care of their own stuff until I had to teach my sister-in-law how to change a tire on her car.\u201d\n No matter the reputation count, each one of us is pushing the needle forward for repair, and doing what we can to reduce (and one day eliminate) the harsh effects that poor design and e-waste have on the planet.\n So keep up the good work ladies! There is still plenty of fixing to do!", "posttime": "2022-01-11 03:09:14", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5973\u58eb\u4eec,ifixit", "title":

"note_en": "Mozilla is one of the Open Source greatest champions of all time. It played a unique role throughout history in the promotion of Free Software and greatly contributed to the success of Linux.\n In the 90\u2019s Netscape Navigator was the most popular Web browser but it quickly lost its lead to Internet Explorer which came bundled with Microsoft Windows. The Web was changing rapidly, Explorer was dominant (it reached 95% user share in 2003) to the point where most websites no longer cared about compatibility with other browsers or operating systems and we got in a situation where Microsoft de-facto dictated Web standards.\n Netscape did something formidable at the time. It released its source code to the World. Mozilla was formed to use that code and coordinate the development of a new Open Source browser, which eventually became Firefox. A few years later the Web was no longer dominated by a single browser. In 2010 Firefox represented 30% of the user share and Internet Explorer had gone down to 50%.\n Firefox didn\u2019t just save the Web, it promoted the idea of Free Software to millions of people who were using Windows, Mac or other proprietary operating systems. In the 2000\u2019s, distribution shipped with Firefox, which many Windows users already knew and loved. This made it easier for people to migrate to Linux and distributions became more mainstream.\n We have our champions. Pioneers and early adopters remember the importance of key projects and key personalities in the history of Linux and of Free Software. I remember using Netscape on Unix terminals at the university, even before we had Linux at home. I remember having the best browser available at a time when even getting a sound card to work in our favorite operating system was a challenge and very few software applications were available.\n Nowadays this is still true. Firefox is still a champion of Open Source, it still proudly promotes Free Software outside of our community and it still produces one of the best and the most open browsers available not only to us but to millions of people who enjoy it on proprietary operating systems before migrating to Linux.\n It\u2019s a real pleasure for us to join forces with Mozilla and to start this partnership.\n  Firefox will continue to be distributed as .deb packages through the official Linux Mint repositories. Its configuration and the way it is built is changing to make the Linux Mint version of Firefox much more similar (almost identical in fact) to the version which is distributed by Mozilla.\n In the past Linux Mint used its own default settings and configured Firefox in a specific way. Most of this configuration is abandoned to go back to Mozilla defaults.\n The default search engines no longer include Linux Mint search partners (Yahoo, DuckDuckGo\u2026) but Mozilla search partners (Google, Amazon, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Ebay\u2026)\n For Mozilla, the goal is to make Firefox work the same way across all platforms to ease maintenance and simplify development and bug fixing. With these changes Firefox will give the same experience in Linux Mint as it does in other operating systems.\n For us, this change means a tremendous simplification in terms of maintenance and development. We used to build Firefox ourselves using Ubuntu\u2019s packaging (which is set to be discontinued as Ubuntu is moving towards snap). We now package the Mozilla version of Firefox instead.\n With this partnership we also satisfy Mozilla\u2019s requests when it comes to using their intellectual property (their name, brands and identity). For example, the Firefox icon is changing to follow Mozilla\u2019s usage guidelines.\n   It\u2019s both. Thanks to this partnership it\u2019s also much easier for us to communicate with Mozilla and to work with them on improving Firefox in Linux Mint.\n In the past we added support for XApp window progress, which is the the ability to show progress in the Cinnamon panel window list when you download something with Firefox.\n Better support for rounded corner in Firefox\u2019s own window decorations is coming in Firefox 96.\n We\u2019re hoping to work with Mozilla on software updates in 2022, to make it easier for Firefox and the Update Manager to work together and for users to be able to see and apply browser updates straight from the browser itself.\n  In Linux Mint 19.x, 20.x and LMDE the transition is taking place with Firefox version 96, and it is planned for January 11th \u2013 January 12th.\n In Linux Mint 20.3 the transition took place during the BETA with Firefox version 95.\n  Technically and ideally, no. Preserving user settings is key. It\u2019s a very important notion in software development and it\u2019s taken very seriously both by Linux Mint and by Mozilla.\n Changes to the default settings can however have an impact on your experience, since your settings are basically a layer of changes (overwrites) on top of the default values. As the default values change, any setting which isn\u2019t overridden by a user value can indeed trigger a behavior change.\n  Yes, your default engine will continue to be Google. The only change is that it no longer will be a user added engine, it will be considered (and replaced by Firefox) as a system core engine.\n I used Yahoo/DuckDuckGo/StartPage as my default search engine, will it continue to be my default?\n No, these were core engines in the Linux Mint configuration. They no longer are present in the Mozilla version of Firefox. The default engine will switch to Google. DuckDuckGo will remain available but with a different URL (it\u2019s a Mint search partner in the Mint configuration, but only a Mozilla partner in the Mozilla configuration).\n   In other browsers the only engines which generate an income for Linux Mint are Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Startpage.\n      Note that \u201cmint-001\u201d and \u201c1.0\u201d are not the version of Firefox. They don\u2019t relate to the packaging version either. They just represent identifiers of Linux Mint within Firefox.\n    In Linux Mint the Update Manager is responsible for all software updates, and applying updates requires root privileges.\n \u201c Your browser is being managed by your organization\u201d might look a bit scary but all it means is that Firefox was told to not worry about updating itself.\n In the About dialog, \u201c Updates disabled by your system administrator\u201d has the same meaning.\n We\u2019ll work with Mozilla on this, first to rephrase this, and hopefully later this year to be able to handle Firefox updates from within Firefox.\n      This helps us understand what language you\u2019re using, and to see what relevant packages and versions are installed so we can reproduce issues and troubleshoot them.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 03:06:04", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "linux,mint", "title": "Linux Mint\u4e0eMozilla\u7b7e\u7f72\u4e86\u5408\u4f5c\u5173\u7cfb", "title_en": "Linux Mint signs a partnership with Mozilla", "transed": 1, "url": "https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4244", "via": "", "real_tags": ["linux", "mint"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072653, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "C ++\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cdf\u7cd5\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u662fC ++\u6807\u51c6\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u6b63\u5728\u8fa9\u8bba\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5f3a\u8c03\u6211\u7684\uff09\uff1aSTD :: REGEX\u7684\u5f53\u524d\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4Python\u548cPHP\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u7684\u76f8\u540c\u7528\u9014\u6162\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5927\u7ea610-100\u500d\u6162\u73b0\u4ee3\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7b49\u540c\u7269\uff0c\u5982Rust\u6216Go\u3002 C ++\u4ee5\u7ee9\u6548\u7cdf\u7cd5\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u800cC ++\u9677\u5165\u4e86\u7cdf\u7cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4fee\u590d\u5b83\u5c06\u6253\u7834ABI\u3002 RUDES ......", "note_en": "C++ is a bad example here.

By joining  Mozilla and The Markup\u2019s \u201cFacebook Pixel Hunt\u201d in Firefox, people can help  Rally and The Markup unravel how Facebook\u2019s tracking infrastructure massively collects data about people online \u2013 data that is used to target ads, tailor content recommendations and spread misinformation \u2013 all by simply browsing the web.\n The Markup is the newest partner for  Rally, the privacy-first data-sharing platform  that was  created by Mozilla in 2021 to take back control from platforms that are not transparent about how they use people\u2019s data and make it very difficult for independent outside research to take place. Rally is a novel way for people to help answer systemic questions by contributing their own browsing behavior data, putting it to work as part of a collective effort to solve societal problems that start online and that we have not been able to investigate this way before.\n Using tools provided by Rally, the two organizations will research how Facebook tracks people across the web through its Facebook pixel-powered ad network and shine a light on what Facebook knows about their online life. By opting into  \u201cThe Facebook Pixel Hunt\u201d study, Rally gives Firefox users the power to help answer questions like: What kind of data does the Facebook pixel collect? Which sites share this data? What can this data reveal about people? What other ways does Facebook track people? How widespread is Facebook\u2019s tracking network?\n Mozilla is excited to partner with The Markup. Cited by legislators to combat  discriminatory tenant screening and mortgage lending, The Markup\u2019s journalism has distinguished itself with its direct impact on people\u2019s lives. The partnership of the two organizations brings together Rally\u2019s technical skill and The Markup\u2019s data-driven investigative journalism, exposing the problems of informational asymmetry on the internet and shedding light on systems of online surveillance used by companies like Facebook.\n \u201cA tool like Rally can bring the full force of communities of people joining together to provide insights into one of the most opaque parts of the internet that have such a dramatic impact on our individual lives and on society. This is a rare opportunity to lift the veil over Facebook\u2019s tracking and data collection practices outside of the Facebook platforms.\u201d\n Ted Han, Rally Product Lead at Mozilla\n Facebook has repeatedly slowed down efforts to bring transparency and to help independent third parties research and understand the mechanisms at play on its platforms: it  shut down CrowdTangle,  blocked ProPublica\u2019s Ad Transparency tools,  modified code to prevent The Markup\u2019s Citizen Browser from collecting user-volunteered data and canceled  NYU\u2019s AdObserver researchers\u2019 accounts.\n \u201cThe Internet and the world cannot wait on platforms to do the right thing, especially when so much depends on it. This partnership seeks to lead the way in providing new and critical ways of illuminating the reality of the internet, led by the people who make it. This partnership comes at a time when the consequences of fragmented awareness have never been more stark.\u201d\n  Ted Han, Rally Product Lead at Mozilla\n \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to partner with Mozilla, which shares our commitment to a more transparent and trusted internet. Rally is an open invitation for the public to contribute to important research into some of today\u2019s most pressing issues, and we\u2019re excited to investigate wherever it leads.\u201d\n Julia Angwin, editor-in-chief and founder of The Markup\n The Markup will be Rally\u2019s first non-academic partner. Rally launched as a Firefox extension in 2021. It has supported a study in collaboration with  Princeton University\u2019s Center for Information Technology Policy about news and misinformation about politics and COVID-19 across online services, and another ongoing study with  the Stanford University Graduate School of Business on news consumption and the impact of ads.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 02:54:58", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "facebook,\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34,partners", "title": "Mozilla\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u4e0e\u6807\u8bb0\u5b66\u4e60Facebook\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6", "title_en": "Mozilla partners with The Markup to study Facebook tracking and data collection", "transed": 1, "url": "https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/mozilla-themarkup-partner-rally-facebook-tracking-data-collection/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["facebook", "\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34", "partners"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "cec382bb5ab0479563eee67628857dec.jpg", "infoid": 1072650, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5f53\u5979\u7684\u5bb6\u4eba\u6210\u4e86\u623f\u4e3b\u65f6\uff0c\u8389\u65af\u5e74\u8f7b\u4eba\u8bb0\u5f97\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u516d\u5c81\uff0c\u5979\u4e5f\u660e\u767d\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u4e0d\u4e86\u7684\u4e8b\u3002\u8fd9\u5f15\u8d77\u4e86\u4e0e\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u548c\u623f\u5c4b\u62e5\u6709\u7684\u8ff7\u604b\u3002\u5728\u5728\u5f6d\u535a\u793e\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5979\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u5728\u623f\u5c4b\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u5979\u60f3\u628a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u529b\u91cf\u8d4b\u4e88\u5e73\u5747\u623f\u4e3b\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5979\u521b\u7acb\u4e86\u5883\u754c\uff0c\u8fd9\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u623f\u4e3b\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u6539\u9020\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bb6\u5ead\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5e76\u660e\u667a\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u91d1\u94b1\u3002 Darrell\uff0cJordan\u548cLiz\u8c08\u5230\u4e86\u68d8\u624b\u7684\u4f4f\u623f\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u672c\u5730\u5316\u6570\u636e\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u623f\u4e3b\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u4ee5\u53caDarrell\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u4ed6\u7684\u5730\u4e0b\u5ba4Dungeon\u5065\u8eab\u623f\u7528\u4e8e\u8fce\u63a5ROI\u3002", "note_en": "Liz Young remembers when her family became homeowners, even at six years old she understood it was a big deal.

Last night, the HFPA\u2019s Golden Globes Twitter account regularly  forgot to note which TV or movie projects Globe recipients were winning for \u2014 like how  Andrew Garfield\u2019s win was for \u201ctick, tick\u2026BOOM!\u201d, for example \u2014 when it was announcing the night\u2019s winners on social media. The organization also oddly referred to \u201cWest Side Story\u2019s\u201d laughter (?) as being \u201cthe best medicine,\u201d in a tweet it later deleted, only to be posted again to say that  music was the best medicine \u2014 which is not how that saying goes.\n  Nowhere in these deeply chaotic Golden Globe tweets do they even mention the projects people are winning for  pic.twitter.com/4Tt5CHaojE\n  In addition to being an overall quieter year as the HFPA tries to reform its organization following the controversies, the winning networks also aren\u2019t touting their victories as they would normally, despite some seeing some notable firsts and upsets.\n  In prior years, HBO would be happily promoting its sweep over rivals. The network led the night with six wins, including four for HBO and two for HBO Max. Several of these were for its TV series \u201cSuccession,\u201d which won for best TV drama, TV drama actor (Jeremy Strong), and supporting actress (Sarah Snook.) HBO Max\u2019s comedy \u201cHacks\u201d also notably beat out Emmy winner \u201cTed Lasso\u201d (Apple TV+) as best comedy, and saw its lead, Jean Smart, win for best actress in a comedy. And Kate Winslet won best TV actress in a limited series for HBO\u2019s \u201cMare of Easttown\u201d.\n Meanwhile, though Netflix  led the year by nominations \u2014 including for best dramatic film \u201cThe Power of the Dog\u201d and drama series \u201cSquid Game\u201d \u2014 it had said it wouldn\u2019t participate in the event until the HFPA institutes changes. That decision means it\u2019s also now not bragging about a couple of notable firsts that resulted from last night\u2019s awards.\n Netflix\u2019s big win of the night was for its original film, \u201cThe Power of the Dog,\u201d which became the streamer\u2019s first-ever movie to take home a Golden Globe for best motion picture (drama). The movie also won for best director (Jane Campion) and best supporting actor (Kodi Smit-McPhee).\n In addition, Netflix\u2019s runaway hit TV series \u201cSquid Game\u201d received three nominations this year, leading to  the first-ever win for South Korea, as South Korean actor O Yeong-su won for his role in the series, beating out \u201cSuccession\u2019s\u201d Kieran Culkin (HBO) and \u201cThe Morning Show\u2019s\u201d Billy Crudup (Apple TV+).\n Netflix also won for \u201ctick, tick\u2026BOOM!\u201d when Andrew Garfield took the trophy for best actor in a motion picture (musical or comedy), though the tweet had forgotten to credit the project by name.\n Apple TV+ took home one win last night as \u201cTed Lasso\u2019s\u201d Jason Sudeikis won best actor in a TV series (comedy). Hulu also got one Globe, as \u201cDopesick\u2019s\u201d Michael Keaton won best actor in a TV limited series or motion picture made for television, while Amazon Prime Video\u2019s \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d won the category. Amazon Prime Video\u2019s \u201cBeing the Ricardos\u201d was highlighted with Nicole Kidman\u2019s win as best actress in a motion picture.\n In another milestone, the first trans actress to win a Golden Globe, FX\u2019s \u201cPose\u201d star Michaela Ja\u00e9 Rodriguez, took home the trophy for best actress in a drama.\n 20th Century Studio/Disney\u2019s \u201cWest Side Story\u201d won best picture (musical or comedy) and its stars, Rachel Zegler and Ariana DeBose won best actress and supporting actress, respectively. Disney\u2019s \u201cEncanto,\u201d which streamed on Disney+ just a month after hitting theaters, won best animated picture.\n Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cDune\u201d got the trophy for best score (Hans Zimmer), and Will Smith was named best actor in a motion picture (drama) for \u201cKing Richard.\u201d\u00a0The best non-English language picture award went to the Japanese film \u201cDrive My

"note_en": "Across cultures and geographies, animals have been such a vital part of the food chain that it\u2019s hard to imagine a world where animals are not put to the knife to produce protein.\n There\u2019s no stopping innovation, however, and alternative sources of protein are increasingly becoming a choice people would rather make.\n Cell-cultured meat is one such source. Also known as cultivated or lab-grown meat, this process uses cells from animals to make meat without slaughter. While the nascent sector is a hot topic for the benefits it promises, the process remains slow and costly.\n Investments in this sector are heating up, though. If 2021 was anything to go by, there is an abundance of both companies and investors hungry for ways to scale and speed up the process \u2014 and do it profitably.\n However, it\u2019s not yet clear when meat grown in labs will reach the kind of scale required to see it at your local grocery store.\n   Cell-cultured meat owes its growing popularity, at least in part, to some of the macro challenges the world faces with food production. Overcultivation, human-made climate change and diminishing sources of water are all contributing to a future where food insecurity will be a gigantic problem.\n The outlook is bleak: The United Nations estimates  food production will need to double to feed the  nearly 10 billion people expected to populate the planet by 2050. As for protein, people around the world  consumed about 324 million metric tons of meat in 2020, and that number is set to  rise even further.\n Changing how we cultivate and produce food is key to solving this problem, and we already have  systems like vertical farming to address the problem of overcultivation, as well as protein sources other than meat. Currently, alternative protein  makes up just about 2% of the animal protein market, but it is expected to increase more than 7x by 2025.\n \u201cWe are trying to meet the  Paris Agreement, but we can\u2019t meet that without addressing the food system and the way we produce meat, eggs and dairy,\u201d said Sharyn Murray, senior investor engagement specialist at Good Food Institute, a nonprofit advocating for reimagined meat production. \u201cThe conversion ratio for calories in versus calories out is seven to eight calories for a chicken for one calorie out, while plant-based is one calorie in and one out.\u201d\n Cultivated meat is just one of the approaches to meeting future demand for protein alongside plant-based and fermentation techniques. Murray and others I spoke to referred to the movement as \u201ca massive transformation of the food system that will take time.\u201d Meaning the shift will not happen overnight, Murray said.\n There is also only one company with cell-cultured meat products available in the market currently: Eat Just, whose subsidiary GOOD Meat has received regulatory approval to produce and sell its cell-cultured meat in Singapore. Eat Just also recently received approval to sell chicken breasts made with cell cultures.\n  Josh Tetrick, co-founder and CEO of Eat Just, said the movement is here even if people are not buying a lot of lab-grown meat yet.\n \u201cIt is still small-scale, and the most important thing we are doing that other companies should do is focus on the design, engineering and full-scale installations of vessels and the supporting systems to make a lot of it.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-11 01:56:35", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u51c6\u5907,cultured,\u8089\u7c7b", "title": "\u7ec6\u80de\u57f9\u517b\u7684\u8089\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u4e86\u5417\uff1f", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tIs cell-cultured meat ready for prime time?\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/is-cell-cultured-meat-ready-for-prime-time/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u51c6\u5907", "cultured", "\u8089\u7c7b"]}]
