The open-label randomised trial will assess the efficacy, tolerability and safety of BNT111 in combination with Libtayo. It will enrol 120 patients and will evaluate the effects of the combination, as well as stand-alone individual agents. BNT111 is the lead product candidate from BioNTech\u2019s FixVac platform and targets a fixed combination of mRNA-encoded, tumour-associated antigens, with the aim of activating a strong and precise immune response against cancer.     The candidate is fully owned by BioNTech while Libtayo, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, is being co-developed by Regeneron and Sanofi. \u201cBNT111 is an intravenous therapeutic cancer vaccine candidate encoding for a fixed set of four cancer-specific antigens optimised for immunogenicity and delivered as RNA-lipoplex formulation,\u201d says BIoNTech. According to the firm, more than 90% of melanomas in patients express at least one of the four tumour-associated antigens encoded in BNT11; NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A3, tyrosinase and TPTE.   The BNT111-01 trial, which is being carried out in collaboration with Regeneron, was reviewed and approved by the regulatory authorities in EU countries Spain, Germany, Italy and Poland as well as in the UK, the US and Australia. The first patient has been dosed in the EU. The primary endpoint of the study is to assess the overall response rate of BNT111 in combination with Libtayo. Secondary endpoints include overall response rate in the single-agent arms, duration of response and safety. \u201cOur vision is to harness the power of the immune system against cancer and infectious diseases. We were able to demonstrate the potential of mRNA vaccines in addressing Covid-19. We must not forget, that cancer is also a global health threat, even worse than the current pandemic,\u201d said BioNTech\u2019s co-founder and CMO \u00d6zlem T\u00fcreci. \u201cBNT111 has already shown a favourable safety profile and encouraging preliminary results in early clinical evaluation. With the start of patient treatment in our Phase II trial, we are encouraged to continue on our initial path to realise the potential of mRNA vaccines for cancer patients.\u201d    This Phase II trial is based on previous results from the Phase I Lipo-MERIT dose-escalation trial that confirmed a favourable safety profile in 89 patients with advanced melanoma. Additionally, efficacy analysis of the Lipo-MERIT study in a subset of 42 metastatic melanoma patients treated earlier with a checkpoint-inhibitor demonstrated that BNT111 mediated durable responses, both as a single agent and in combination with anti-PD-1 antibodies. Durable objective responses by BNT111 were associated with activation and strong expansion of tumor-antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These results were published in   Nature in July 2020. BioNTech also plans to start randomised Phase II trials with mRNA vaccine product candidates in two additional programs in 2021. \u201cAs part of its development strategy, BioNTech aims to rapidly advance its broad oncology pipeline and expects to bring additional candidates into late-stage clinical development and towards market entry within the next five years,\u201d said the firm.",

  \u6807\u51c6 ", "note_en": "Below are some thoughts that I put together in my journey to learn how to become a better manager of engineers. The learning journey continues.\n     You must have a vision of where you would like the team to go. A team needs to have long term goals that fit within the organization. Imagine the most perfect version of your team. What should it do? Should it evolve to several teams? Should it focus on fewer responsibilities? Should your team build a new product or process? ..etc. The \u201cmost perfect version\u201d of a team is subjective, it will likely differ from one person to the next. So feel free to consult your leaders, your team, you peers, what have you. However, it\u2019s on you to put the vision together, or else your management career will devolve into a series of reactions.\n Having said all that, a vision without a strategy is a work of fiction. A fancy idea that will stay an idea. Think of small incremental steps that follow your paths of least resistance to get to your vision. Those small incremental steps become your strategy. Some steps you\u2019ll get right, others you will get wrong. Fail fast, learn, then iterate.\n A strategy without execution is still akin to a work of fiction, more of hard fiction though as opposed to a fancy idea. Execution is taking action, following the steps of your strategy, making things happen, and bringing the vision to reality piece by piece. Believe it or not, but there is a big difference between planning to build a piece of software vs actually building it!\n This is much easier said than done. Orgs change, priorities shift, and no vision is set in stone. You need to be acutely aware of this simple fact &amp; to be ready to change when change is needed. Your strategy will then have to adapt. As in, you\u2019ll have to salvage whatever you can from the existing strategy, then build newer incremental steps that align with the new vision. If you wait for too long, you\u2019ll become stagnant, a slow wheel! Who wants that?!\n  You are responsible for the success and the growth of the people who report to you. You must deeply understand and know your people. The first thing you should know is what motivates them. Some people are motivated by praise, others are motivated by cash, others like to have big impacts. Humans are very sophisticated creatures, we don\u2019t always know what we need or what we want.\n You have to stretch your people a bit and get a feeling for their boundaries. They may be hesitant to make moves, because they might be worried of failure or blame. You have to supply an environment where it was ok to fail, but fail fast and iterate quickly. As your people grow, you grow, your team grows, and your org grows.\n Stretching your people doesn\u2019t mean pushing against their paths of most resistance. You have to align your strategy with your people. For example, if in your strategy you plan to execute heavy user outreach, don\u2019t assign the task to an engineer who\u2019d much prefer to stay awake at 3 AM to figure out a software bug! And no, not all engineers like to do engineering work at the wee hours of the night. And yes, some engineers actually do enjoy user outreach.\n Don\u2019t assume your people are happy. You have to take steps to first know whether they are happy, and then take steps to make them happy if they are not.\n  You have to figure out how build alignments beyond your team. This not only includes other teams, but also key stakeholders, and with neighboring orgs. Key stakeholders are not just other leaders, or your customers. Key stakeholders include the scrappy technician, the genius engineer, the experienced product manager, the passionate program manager, the data driven project manager..etc. They are the ones who can actually make things happen, because they possess the \u2018street knowledge\u2019. They are the ones who know the limitations, the gotchas &amp; the shortcuts in the technology and in the process. If your strategy does not offer wins to other teams or key stakeholders, then your strategy is wrong. Building efficient and ongoing alignment with other stakeholders and organizations is so important for your team\u2019s growth and evolution.\n You need to identify the win-wins, and incorporate it in your strategy , even if it\u2019ll theoretically take a bit of more time. That is because win-win strategies are the most likely to happen. Win-wins mean that you win &amp; others win too, even if you don\u2019t get every single thing that you want. Once you identify the win-wins, share them with other stakeholders, then iterate and evolve. Make stakeholders feel included. Don\u2019t assume they will feel included, you need to make some efforts.\n   Standard", "posttime": "2021-06-19 09:44:39", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News",

popular belief among young people in the United States today. According to  one survey, 68% of American millennials &#34;agree&#34; or &#34;strongly agree&#34; that they have &#34;more, tougher financial obstacles than previous generations&#34; and 49% believe that they are &#34;living in the worst economic environment in the last century.&#34;\n To be clear, this perception isn&#39;t based on literally  nothing\u2014there are some dimensions along which young people have it worse. But as far as I can tell, this belief, when taken as a whole, is completely, ludicrously false. Pants on fire. It&#39;s not even close to being right.\n Not only are young people not worse off than previous generations, they are better off along nearly every meaningful economic axis.\n   The first most obvious thing to point out is that real GDP per capita\u2014meaning, adjusted for costs of living\u2014is  up about 374% since 1950. If GDP is calculated correctly, it should correspond to mean income levels, which means that the mean income among people alive today is nearly four times higher than it was in 1950.\n  We can also look at the  growth in average personal consumption, which has risen about 950% since 1950, clearly indicating that Americans today have far more  disposable income than in the past.\n  Mean statistics might be misleading of course, since outliers can skew the data (see also the section in this post on inequality). But when you look at statistics tracking median income, you see a similar trend. The U.S. Census Bureau  reports that median household income in 1984 was $52,679, but was $68,703 in 2019, a 30% gain.\n Now, there is a legitimate question of whether these gains have been felt by the younger generations. The National Center for Education Statistics  reveals that real incomes have only increased slightly\u2014about 9%\u2014in the last 25 years for people between the ages of 25 and 34.\n  My first reply is that it\u2019s important to note that median income data can understate the true increases of living standards. That&#39;s because data sources oftentimes only include people&#39;s after-tax take-home pay, after deducting worker benefits like health insurance. When you try to include these benefits, the  growth in real income has been much larger than these statistics generally show.\n My second reply is that, ethically speaking, even if these gains merely reflected the fact that old people are getting richer, rather than young people, it wouldn&#39;t make much of a difference to my general argument, as millennials will eventually get older, and thus benefit from these gains just as old people do now.\n To some, these statistics aren\u2019t enough to show that millennials aren\u2019t doing better. In the face of these statistics, lots of people will still argue that young people are worse off in more subtle ways. Here are some of the most common of these objections and my rebuttals:\n  Yes, but it&#39;s not clear that those things imply that standards of living are declining in any meaningful way. Arguably, the main reason why costs have gone up in these areas is because society is richer, and thus more willing to bear the cost of better facilities and higher wages for healthcare and education workers. This effect is known as  Baumol&#39;s cost disease.\n Health care and education are in many ways  positional goods, though it would probably take a book to compellingly argue for this thesis (here are two:  education and  health care). In this sense, rising costs in these areas don\u2019t necessarily indicate lowering standards of living\u2014quite the opposite in fact.\n As an analogy, imagine if the cost of jewelry went up. Which of the following is more likely to have been the cause of this rise in price: that some combination of greed and exploitation caused sellers to raise their prices, or that people have more disposable income now, and therefore demand more expensive jewelry?\n Consistent with this thesis, healthcare spending and costs  tend to strongly correlate with disposable income. If you believed that rising healthcare costs were indicative of a lowering standard of living, then you should also probably believe that people in the poorest nations on Earth have the highest standards of living\u2014which is obviously absurd.\n   If the main reason why college and healthcare is so expensive is because society is now richer than it was before, then that would imply the opposite of what people normally claim here: that young people have it worse than previous generations.\n But today people need a college degree in order to survive. Back in my parent&#39;s days, you could just get a well paying job as a factory worker right out of high school.\n Yes, credential inflation is a real problem (and one whose  solution is precisely the  opposite of &#34;we need to encourage more people to go to college&#34;), however, the National Center for Education Statistics  data shows almost no difference in median incomes among non-college graduates over the last 25 years. It seems that it has at least not gotten harder recently to enjoy a minimum standard of living without a college degree.\n  The average cost of housing  has gone up over time, but this trend is mainly driven by the fact that modern houses are larger and built better than houses in the past. For example, the average house size has  more than doubled since the 1950s, and new housing must pass stringent regulation to ensure that e.g. there is no lead paint. What matters most is whether people can afford the same quality of housing than their parents and grandparents were able to afford. And the  Zillow mortgage affordability index has tracked the affordability of housing relative to people&#39;s real incomes and  finds that people today have an easier time buying housing relative to their incomes than the previous generations.\n The decline of home ownership is also overblown. Overall, the home ownership rate has actually  slightly risen since the 1960s, though it did enter a decline after peaking in the early 2000s. During nearly this whole period, home ownership rates have stayed within a narrow 6% window from 63% to 69%.\n  [Note: In an illustration of just how nuanced debates about housing prices can get, a user on Reddit pointed out that  the median age of homebuyers has gone from 31 to 47 in the last 4 decades as evidence that the above chart was misleading. But that\u2019s  all homebuyers. When you look at the age of first-home buyers, the trend has  barely budged, rising by a few years since 1981. So, lots people are buying more than one home now\u2014not exactly economic decline.]\n That said, I agree with people who have complained about  burdensome regulations unnecessarily restricting the supply of housing, thus raising prices, and I do hope millennials can be wise enough to eventually repeal this bad policy.\n  Not right now, no. Although student loan debt has increased greatly in recent decades,  the generation with the most debt is technically Generation X. The baby boomers aren&#39;t that far behind either.\n   Debt is also more affordable than it was 40 or 50 years ago. For example, mortgage interest rates have  declined sharply.\n  In the future, millennials will likely take on more debt than their parents, but this won\u2019t necessarily be a bad thing. One of the main functions of debt is to smooth consumption over time. The basic idea is that if you expect to be much richer in the future, it makes sense to take out a lot of debt so that you can enjoy a high standard of living right now, and pay the debt off later. In fact,  nations with the highest average household debt also tend to be the richest. Therefore, rising levels of debt often indicate rising standards of living, not the opposite.\n I should note that this argument can also neatly explain why I\u2019m not worried about the slight decline in relative net worth among millennials as, for instance, talked about in  this recent Bloomberg article.\n  Firstly, economic inequality does not directly determine standards of living. You can have a highly unequal society with high median standards of living, just as you can have a highly equal society with low median standards of living.\n Secondly, whether inequality has gotten worse depends on which statistics you are looking at. The most common measure used to determine inequality is the  Gini coefficient of pre-tax income. In my opinion, this is a bad measure of inequality, as it doesn&#39;t take into account the redistributive effects of taxes and government transfers. It also doesn\u2019t take into account the fact that people&#39;s income will grow over time as their career progresses; a society in which everyone receives the same amount of lifetime income, but in which young people earn lower wages than older people, will be seen as unequal by this measure, which seems ethically arbitrary.\n Another bad measure is wealth inequality, which neglects the reality of consumption smoothing. Under this measure, old people who have saved money for retirement are counted as rich, even if they have a low standard of living, and young medical school graduates who took on a lot debt are counted as poor, even if they are in the top 1% of income earners. It\u2019s not clear why we should care about inequality caused purely by people choosing to save money rather than spend it frivolously.\n Put another way, if Jeff Bezos spent $10 billion to personally fly to the moon and back, this would decrease national wealth inequality compared to just holding stock. And, investing does have social value,  even if it produces inequities.\n For these reasons, I think the only measure of inequality that you should be concerned about is  consumption inequality across one\u2019s lifetime, that is, inequality between people in what they actually purchase to sustain their lifestyle during their lifespan. Numerous studies have found that consumption inequality has  stayed roughly constant since the 1960s.\n   It is true that the 2008 and 2020 economic crises were bad in terms of their effects on employment. However, it&#39;s not clear that this overall economic era is worse than prior eras in terms of employment. The early 1980s recession  saw an unemployment rate of 10.8%, exceeding the maximum experienced during the 2008 financial crisis. The 2020 recession saw even greater unemployment at 14.8%, but this was an extremely acute effect of coronavirus lockdowns. By late 2020, unemployment had nearly returned to historically normal levels. Furthermore, before the 2020 recession, the unemployment rate was at the lowest point it had been in over 50 years.\n  Sure, but millennials were hit with the Great Recession, and now we\u2019re hit with the coronavirus recession.\n The Great Recession was bad relative to previous recessions following the Great Depression. But that\u2019s not the greatest measure of whether quality of life was worse during that time period compared to the past.\n To start, the  frequency of recessions has declined over time in US history. Being hit with only two recessions in one generation actually a historical aberration, when you take a longer-view perspective. The period between 2009-2020 was in fact  the longest period of uninterrupted growth in US history.\n Our expectations tend to warp our experience. Look, a recession is usually defined as some sort of decline in GDP or consumer spending. When GDP goes up by 2%, we don\u2019t call that an anti-recession, or a \u201cboom.\u201d We just call it normal life, since growth rates like that are what we\u2019ve been conditioned to accept.\n When the norm is for things to get better, sometimes mere stagnation can make things seem like things are taking a nosedive. Humans seem to have a  persistent bias towards perceiving that things are getting worse. But it\u2019s important to keep your mind open to the bigger picture. At the bottom of the Great Recession, in quarter 2 of 2009, real GDP per capita  declined to\u2026 the level it was previously at in 2004, just 5 years earlier.\n I know that GDP per capita is not a perfect measure for measuring quality of life. Yet I also know of no other good aggregate measures which don\u2019t follow something similar to this pattern.\n  It\u2019s true that the federal minimum wage   has  declined when adjusted for inflation since the 1970s.\n   However, the minimum wage establishes, as per its name, a  minimum wage level. It doesn&#39;t tell us much about average standard of living. Most states also set  their own minimum wages higher than the federal level.\n Furthermore, since the 1970s\u2014the period of a declining minimum wage\u2014 welfare transfers to the poor went up, arguably raising the minimum standard of living. This rising minimum standard can be illustrated by, for example, the fact that the proportion of Americans who live in severely crowded housing has been  cut by over 75% since 1975, and that air conditioning is  seven times more prevalent among poor households now than in the 1960s.\n  When I first learned in my high school textbooks about the &#34;booming&#34; economic environment of the 1950s, I gathered a sense that the US economy might have already peaked. This opinion was then, and still is, backed by common wisdom that boomers were handed the world on a silver platter and proceeded to ruin it. But when I started looking into real evidence, I found that this concept was based on little more than misconception and a handful of misleading statistics.\n This all makes sense from a psychological perspective. Many young people probably just find it convenient to believe that they have experienced undue economic hardship, since they can win sympathy that way. And most people naturally think that we should care about the plight of young folks more than old folks.\n Nearly everyone is aware of new technological developments, and so they\u2019re probably cognizant in some sense that things are better than before. Yet, most remain unaware that ordinary measures of standards of living are up too. This is all unfortunate however, since the rise in both minimum and average standards of living in the United States\u2014and the world more generally\u2014is one of the most important historical facts you can know.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 09:44:08", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5343\u79a7,don,\u751f\u6d3b", "title":

", "note_en": "Today is a doubly important day: it marks the final day of the  PEARL campaign and it is a celebration of another victory for the life extension community.\n PEARL smashed its initial fundraising goal and sailed through its two stretch goals, raising just under $183k thanks to the generous support of the community.\n  The Participatory Evaluation (of) Aging (with) Rapamycin (for) Longevity Study, or PEARL, will launch the first large-scale placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine the effects of rapamycin on human aging. The principal investigator is Dr. James P. Watson based at UCLA.\n   Rapamycin is a naturally occurring antifungal antibiotic produced by soil bacteria originally discovered on Easter Island, also known as Rapa Nui.\n While most people know it as a drug used in high doses for organ rejection during transplants, it has potential as a drug to slow down aging in far lower doses. It was the first drug proven to  extend the lifespan of mice, even when given late in life, and has been shown to reliably increase the lifespan of yeast, worms, and rats.\n Rapamycin works through the  mTOR signaling pathway, a master regulator of cellular and energy metabolism, and a potent trigger of  autophagy, the ultimate cellular recycling mechanism.\n Recent research shows that it also  improves how our DNA is stored which helps combat  genomic instability resulting from DNA damage and harmful  epigenetic alterations to gene expression which drive the aging process.\n Until now, there has not been a proper clinical trial to evaluate if rapamycin can slow down aging in humans. PEARL is going to change that thanks to our supporters.\n   This large-scale clinical trial will allow the researchers to find out if the effects of rapamycin will translate to people. If that were to happen, then the potential impact could be massive. Having a drug that demonstrably slows down human aging confirmed by large-scale clinical trial data would really open doors. The data could help garner wider public support for life extension therapies as well as support dialogue with policymakers and healthcare regulatory bodies.\n Also, rapamycin is a relatively cheap, off-patent, generic drug and widely available. It has been a registered drug for decades with a well-known safety profile and characteristics. If longevity benefits are confirmed, then it could potentially start being used in healthcare to address aging almost immediately.\n  This has been the most successful crowdfunding campaign we have ever hosted on Lifespan.io, and it is all thanks to you, our amazing life extension community.\n  Over 409 of you have donated just under $183k to the campaign since its launch on May 17th, helping to make this one of the largest, if not the largest, crowdfunded aging focused biology projects in the world.\n This successful fundraising really showcases the growing power of the life extension community, and part of this power comes from the cryptocurrency community. In the last few years, thanks to people like Vitalik Buterin, there has been an increasing level of support from the cryptocurrency community, which is greatly appreciated.\n  The PEARL team and Lifespan.io are incredibly grateful to everyone who donated to PEARL and would like to give special thanks to  Vitalik Buterin, Tom Moya Schau, Micah Zoltu, and Brad Armstrong, who contributed to the campaign with large donations. Thank you so much for your wonderful support; you have really helped to drive this project to success!\n   Due to the huge success of the crowdfunding campaign, the PEARL team wanted to let you all know how the additional funds would be used. The extra money will allow the researchers to measure additional important biomarkers, which will further strengthen the data.\n     Once again from the PEARL team and Lifespan.io, thank you to everyone who has helped make this project possible! For  people in the U.S. interested in participating, please get in touch with\u00a0 Agelessrx and a trial administrator should get back to you.\n Please connect with us on   social media, like and share our content, and help us build grass-roots support for healthy life extension:", "posttime": "2021-06-19 09:43:51", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

\u21a9\u21a92 ", "note_en": "Almost exactly 2 years ago, with the release of v0.7.3,  I announced that Shattered would be dropping support for Android 2.2 Froyo. Now, unfortunately, it\u2019s time to say goodbye to more legacy Android versions.\n v0.9.3 will be the last version of Shattered Pixel Dungeon to support  Android 2.3 Gingerbread, and the less popular  Android 3 Honeycomb. I\u2019ll try to keep support for  Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich going as long as I can, but that one may be near the end of its support life as well.\n Just like with Froyo, I wanted to write a little blog post to summarize why this is happening, and to reminisce a bit on these versions of Android from 2010 and 2011.  1\n  Android 2.3 - 4.0 represents a period of major technical changes for the Android platform. Android 4.0 also brought a complete UI refresh called \u2018holo\u2019, which was the first time Android had a consistent visual design.\n Phones were also roughly doubling in processing power each year during this period. Phones from 2010 topped out at around a single core 1ghz processor, such as my first phone, a  Nexus S. In 2011 though  their successors could easily have dual core 1.2ghz processors.\n Supporting these old Android versions means supporting all of the hardware and software from just before this major transition, which can often cause some technical trouble.\n For Shattered specifically, two game libraries dropped support for Android 2.3 and 3 in mid 2020:  libGDX and  Google Play Billing. For now I\u2019ve been making do with using outdated versions, but as I look to  release on new platforms, and as an  update deadline by Google starts to loom, I\u2019d really like to update to the latest versions. Some parts of libGDX also recently dropped support for Android 4.0, but for the moment I should be able to work around that.\n  Just like with Android 2.2, it\u2019s important to also look at how many devices this change will actually impact.\n Firstly, let\u2019s take a look at the proportion of all devices on Google Play running a particular Android version at five key dates:\n   When PD originally launched these legacy versions where almost the entire Android ecosystem! Even when Shattered launched they were still at almost 25% of all devices. However, today only Android 4.0 has enough devices left to even register in this data. Shattered\u2019s legacy comes from an era where supporting these Android versions was absolutely necessary, but in 2021 the number of devices on these versions is extremely tiny.\n What about the device share for Shattered in particular though? Here\u2019s a chart showing Shattered\u2019s device share for Android 2.2 to 4.0 starting in October 2016:\n  In October 2016 these legacy Android versions were almost 4% of Shattered installs combined, twice the rate they had in Google Play overall! From more approximate data around when Shattered launched (Aug 2014), Android 2.2 was somewhere around 2.5% of all devices and 2.3 and 4.0 were both about 8%.\n As time has gone on usage of these legacy Android versions have fallen substantially though, especially after 2018. Let\u2019s zoom in 2019 and onward for a better look at where things are today:\n  After their drop in 2018, all of the legacy versions were steady for a while. 2.2 and 3 faded first and went toward 0% in late 2020. Android 2.3 lasted longer, but has been dropping sharply over this year. 4.0 has held on a bit better, even growing in 2020, but is now falling away at a slower rate.\n Just like with Android 2.2 in 2019, it seems that the vast majority of the devices which I am ending support for have already stopped playing Shattered.\n  Even just going up to Android 4.1 bumps the user count considerably. Here\u2019s the current proportion of each Android version, first for all apps, then for Shattered, and then the % difference between those:\n   One thing that interests me here is that Shattered used to have a much higher proportion of old android devices than the average. This made sense, if most apps had stopped supporting an Android version, Shattered would have more devices on that version than the average. This doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s the case anymore though. Shattered now has a meager lead for Android 4.3 and older, but otherwise has  LESS old android devices than average!\n In fact, Shattered has more than twice the average number of devices on Android 11! It seems that the days of Shattered having a large number of players on ancient devices have passed. Nowadays the game\u2019s more complex nature causes it to skew heavily toward more dedicated users, who tend to use more modern devices.\n I\u2019ll keep support going as long as I can for each Android version, but it\u2019s nice to know that Shattered has largely outlasted the older devices that it used to support.\n  I\u2019m going to be making another blog post soon, to talk more about the next update. I\u2019m currently planning for this post to be late this month, or possibly early July. If you want quicker, shorter updates about what I\u2019m working on, consider following me on  Twitter!\n If you enjoy Shattered and want to help me keep making it,  please consider supporting me on Patreon! Patrons get access to exclusive weekly mini blogs about upcoming updates, a monthly Q&amp;A livestream, and also help determine content direction through community polls!\n   The title image for this blog was taken from Google\u2019s Android history page, which has wonderful graphics for each version up to 6.0. It\u2019s unfortunately no longer online, but can be accessed (with a little jank) via the  wayback machine.\u00a0 \u21a9\n  The AppBrain\u2019s charts aren\u2019t perfectly accurate to all devices on Google Play, but it\u2019s the best we\u2019ve got since Google stopped reporting their own numbers. From looking at past data, it seems AppBrain skews slightly in favor of more modern Android versions, which only strengthens the points I made in this post.\u00a0 \u21a9\u00a0 \u21a9 2", "posttime": "2021-06-19 09:43:26", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "android,\u544a\u522b,goodbye", "title": "\u544a\u522bAndroid 2.3\u59dc\u997c ", "title_en": "Saying Goodbye to Android 2.3 Gingerbread", "transed": 1, "url": "https://shatteredpixel.com/blog/saying-goodbye-to-android-2.3-gingerbread.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["android", "\u544a\u522b", "goodbye"]}]
