But where does the term actually come from? One possible explanation is, somewhat strangely, Victorian England.</p><p>宿醉一词被普遍理解为是指在过度放纵一夜后遭受的不成比例的痛苦。但是这个词实际上是从哪里来的呢？一种奇怪的解释是维多利亚时代的英格兰。</p><p> During the Victorian era the practice of paying for a ‘two-penny hangover’ was incredibly popular among the country’s homeless population and the term ‘two penny hangover’ was so commonly used that it made its way into contemporary literature. A two-penny hangover is not the description of a very cheap night out, nor is it the amount it would cost you to get drunk in Victorian England. It is actually somewhere you could go to sleep if you were one of the thousands of homeless and destitute living in the country’s main cities at the time. If you lived on the streets and had managed to make some money during the day, depending on how much you had, you could spend the night in one of three ways; paying a penny to sit-up, two pence to ‘hang-over’, or 4 or five pennies to lie down.</p><p> 在维多利亚时代，为“两便士宿醉”买单的做法在该国无家可归的人群中极为流行，“两便士宿醉”一词非常常用，以至于它进入了当代文学。两分钱的宿醉并不是廉价夜生活的描述，也不是您在维多利亚时代的英格兰喝醉所花费的钱。如果您当时是该国主要城市中成千上万的无家可归者和贫困者之一，那么实际上它就是您可以睡觉的地方。如果您生活在大街上，并且白天设法赚钱，具体取决于您的收入，则可以通过以下三种方式之一过夜：花一分钱仰卧起坐，两便士到“宿醉”，或四五便士躺下。</p><p> Victorian society was struggling to pull itself out of centuries of poverty, degradation and  ‘Mother’s Ruin’. It could be argued that society was suffering from a collective hangover from the country’s previous struggles through the  industrial revolution, disease outbreaks and poor laws of the 18th century. In contrast, for some people at least, Victorian England was also a period and place of prosperity and innovation.</p><p> 维多利亚时代的社会正努力摆脱数百年来的贫困，退化和“母亲废墟”。可以说，社会正遭受该国先前因工业革命，疾病暴发和18世纪不良法律而进行的斗争所造成的集体宿命。相比之下，至少对于某些人来说，维多利亚时代的英格兰也是繁荣与创新的时代和地方。</p><p>  The population of Britain at the time lived in both amazing luxury and devastating poverty. The first time the term ‘Victorian’ was used was in 1851.  Queen Victoria had been ruling since 1837, and would in fact go on to rule until 1901. 1851 was also the year of  The Great Exposition, this showed off the very best of industrialisation and innovation from Britain and around the world. This exposition, based in London, was visited by over 6 million people, rich and poor alike.</p><p>  当时的英国人过着奢侈的生活和毁灭性的贫困。第一次使用“维多利亚时代”一词是在1851年。维多利亚女王自1837年以来一直执政，实际上一直统治到1901年。1851年也是大博览会的一年，这展示了来自英国和世界各地的工业化和创新。总部设在伦敦的这一博览会吸引了超过600万人，无论贫富。</p><p> Victorian England exemplified a capitalist entrepreneurial work ethic, a sense of individualism and hard work. It is no coincidence that  Darwin’s ‘Origin of the Species’ was also published at this time. The popularity of his work further cemented the idea of ‘survival of the fittest’ into the public consciousness. Unfortunately what brought prosperity to some brought degradation to others. This was coupled with a ‘laissez faire’ economic approach from the government which saw a surge in poverty in England’s cities. Although  the Empire was flourishing, unfortunately so were the cities’ slums, especially London’s.</p><p> 维多利亚时代的英国体现了资本主义企业家的职业道德，个人主义和勤奋的精神。达尔文的《物种起源》也于此时出版，这并非偶然。他作品的受欢迎程度进一步巩固了“适者生存”的观念。不幸的是，给某些人带来繁荣的原因却给其他人带来了退化。加上政府采取的“放任自流”经济方法，导致英格兰城市的贫困加剧。尽管帝国繁荣昌盛，但不幸的是城市贫民窟也是如此，尤其是伦敦的贫民窟。</p><p>  The population had tripled in the 19th century and there were simply not enough resources to go around. People migrated from the countryside into cities causing overcrowding and lack of work for many. Starvation and degradation were, unfortunately, commonplace. There is a reason that Victorian England is often portrayed in contemporary literature as a dark and depressing palace for its poorest inhabitants. There were 30,000 homeless children in London alone during this time. It is therefore unsurprising that there was so much reference to poverty in contemporary literature. From the street urchins in  Dickens’ ‘Oliver Twist’ to the child chimney sweeps in Charles Kingsley’s ‘The Water Babies’. In fact Dickens actually used one of London’s most notorious and overcrowded slums, or ‘rookeries’ as they were called, ‘Saffron Hill’, as Fagin’s lair for the vagrant children he trained as ruthless pickpockets. For the poorest members of Victorian society life was incredibly hard, especially if you were homeless. It was even harder at night, where as well as contending with exposure and hunger, there were also the added dangers associated with the fall of darkness. If you were homeless you had very limited options. However, if you managed to scrounge up a penny you could at least get out of the rain at a ‘penny sit-up’.</p><p>  人口在19世纪增长了两倍，根本没有足够的资源去闲逛。人们从农村移民到城市，导致许多人拥挤和缺乏工作。不幸的是，饥饿和退化是司空见惯的。维多利亚时代的英格兰经常被其最贫穷的居民描述为一座黑暗而令人沮丧的宫殿，这是有原因的。在此期间，仅伦敦就有30,000个无家可归的孩子。因此，在当代文学中对贫困的提及如此之多就不足为奇了。从狄更斯（Dickens）的《 Oliver Twist》中的街头小顽童到查尔斯·金斯利（Charles Kingsley）的《水上婴儿》中的儿童烟囱扫地。实际上，狄更斯实际上使用了伦敦最臭名昭著且人满为患的贫民窟之一，即所谓的“番红花山”（Saffron Hill），作为Fagin的巢穴，供他训练无情的扒手的流浪儿童使用。对于维多利亚州社会中最贫穷的人来说，生活是非常艰难的，尤其是在您无家可归的情况下。晚上甚至更加艰难，在这里除了要面对暴露和饥饿，还要与黑暗的堕落相关的其他危险。如果您无家可归，那么您的选择就非常有限。但是，如果您设法花一分钱，那么您至少可以在“竹sit仰卧起坐”中下雨。</p><p>  These are exactly as you would imagine them to be. For a penny a homeless person could pay to ‘sit up’ on a bench all night in a hall. Oftentimes this was the only option for people to get off the streets, particularly desirable in England’s wet and freezing winters. Sometimes the rooms would be heated but sometimes they wouldn’t, and the homeless person could also be provided with food but that wasn’t always guaranteed either. The only downside to these arrangements was that they weren’t actually supposed to sleep in these ‘sit-ups’. Some places even went as far as to employ monitors to ensure that no one fell asleep, as the right to sleep was not included in the penny price. It would seem that the majority of the homeless who used these sit-ups were men, but women and children were also documented as having frequented them. Although safer than the streets, most were still associated with being places of squalor, poverty and discomfort.</p><p>  这些正是您所想像的。花一分钱，一个无家可归的人可以花整夜在大厅的长凳上“坐起来”。通常，这是人们走上街头的唯一选择，在英格兰潮湿多雨的冬季尤为可取。有时房间会被加热，但有时却不被加热，无家可归的人也可以得到食物，但这也不能总是得到保证。这些安排的唯一弊端是，他们实际上不该在这些“仰卧起坐”中入睡。有些地方甚至雇用监视器来确保没有人入睡，因为一分钱的价格中没有包括睡眠权。使用这些仰卧起坐的无家可归者似乎大多数是男人，但是据记录，妇女和儿童也经常光顾。尽管比街道安全，但大多数仍然与肮脏，贫穷和不适的地方有关。 </p><p>   For an extra penny you could pay to sleep literally hanging over a rope. This was possibly marginally more comfortable, as if you fell asleep the rope would prevent you from slipping onto the floor or head-butting the bench in front of you. It still wouldn’t have been an overly relaxing experience though. People were crammed in as tightly as possible, and to make sure you got your money’s worth but no more, the rope would be unceremoniously cut the next morning at 5 or 6am. This was done for the dual purpose of freeing up the space, but it also served as a reminder to those lowest in society of just where their place was. Once the rope was cut, the homeless would be kicked out onto the streets once more. Even with the protection that these places offered, they were also not necessarily heated and it was not unheard of for there to be one or two people who could not be woken the next morning, having frozen to death during the night.</p><p>要多花一分钱，您可以花点钱睡在一根绳子上。这可能会稍微舒适一些，因为如果您入睡，那么绳索会阻止您滑到地板上或头顶着前面的长凳。不过，这仍然不是一个过分放松的体验。人们被尽可能地拥挤，为了确保您物有所值，但第二天早上5点或6点，绳索被毫不客气地切断了。这样做的目的是为了释放空间，但同时也提醒了社会上最底层的人他们所处的位置。一旦绳子被切断，无家可归的人将再次被踢出街。即使在这些地方提供了保护的情况下，它们也不一定一定会很热，第二个早晨无法醒来的一两个人在夜间被冻死，这并非闻所未闻。</p><p> The term hangover is unlikely to have come specifically from this practice, it more likely refers to the lasting after effects of alcohol felt the next day. However the two-penny hangovers remained a grim reality of Victorian England regardless of the tenuous link to the etymology of alcohol. Particularly as ‘two-penny hangovers’ have also been mentioned in Paris, and the French for ‘hangover’ is ‘gueule de bois’ which is literally ‘mouth of wood” so nothing to do with ‘hanging over’ at all. But a fairly accurate description of how your mouth feels after a night drinking gin!</p><p> 宿醉一词不太可能专门来自这种做法，它更可能是指第二天酒精影响持续存在。然而，无论与酒精的词源学联系如何薄弱，两便士的宿醉仍然是维多利亚时代英格兰的严峻现实。特别是在巴黎也提到过“两分钱宿醉”，而“宿醉”在法语中是“ gueule de bois”，字面意思是“木头嘴”，因此与“宿醉”完全无关。但是，一个晚上喝杜松子酒后，您的嘴巴的感觉相当准确的描述！</p><p>   Perhaps the creepiest of these peculiar Victorian sleeping arrangements, for those too poor to have a fixed place to sleep, were the four or five penny coffins. Thankfully they weren’t actually coffins. Instead they were small wooden boxes that bore a striking and unpleasant resemblance to coffins. They would be laid out in rows on the floor, and because the idea was to accommodate as many homeless people as possible, the dimensions of the ‘coffins’ were small and not very comfortable. People would also be given an oilcloth or leather blanket to cover themselves with. Often the price would include a cup of tea or coffee and a piece of bread as well. Inevitably people that used them would wake up cramped and sore the next day, although considering they were sleeping in coffins it was likely considered a bonus that they woke up at all!</p><p>   对于那些太贫穷而无法在固定的地方睡觉的人来说，这些奇特的维多利亚式睡眠安排中最令人毛骨悚然的也许就是四五个便士的棺材。幸运的是，它们实际上并不是棺材。取而代之的是，它们是小的木箱，与棺材有着惊人而令人不快的相似之处。它们将被排成一排地放在地板上，并且由于这个想法是要容纳尽可能多的无家可归者，因此“棺材”的尺寸很小而且不太舒适。人们还会得到一块油布或皮革毯子覆盖自己。价格通常会包括一杯茶或咖啡以及一片面包。不可避免的是，使用它们的人第二天醒来就会感到局促和酸痛，尽管考虑到他们睡在棺材里，这可能被认为是完全醒了的奖励！</p><p> However, these makeshift beds were still very much appreciated, as compared to the two previous options, at least in the ‘coffins’ you could lie down horizontally and sleep properly. These coffins were one of England’s first attempts at homeless shelters, and they were started by The Salvation Army, which was itself founded in 1865. The sheer levels of homeless and destitute had been noticed by the recently formed Christian charitable organisation, and this was one of the earliest solutions. In fact, in one contemporary newspaper the number of people using such a shelter nightly in Sheffield was estimated at between 200-300 people a night. The need was clearly very great. Time progressed though and in the latter half of the century homeless shelters began to operate free of charge, doing away with these early unusual solutions.</p><p> 但是，与之前的两个选项相比，这些临时床仍然非常受赞赏，至少在“棺材”中，您可以水平躺下并睡个好觉。这些棺材是英格兰最早在无家可归者收容所中尝试的棺材之一，它们是由救世军创立的，救世军本身成立于1865年。无家可归者和贫困人口的绝对数量已由最近成立的基督教慈善组织注意到，这是其中之一。最早的解决方案。实际上，在一份当代报纸上，在谢菲尔德每晚使用这样的避难所的人数估计为每晚200-300人。显然需求非常大。尽管时间在流逝，但在本世纪下半叶，无家可归者收容所开始免费运营，废除了这些早期的非常规解决方案。</p><p> These peculiar sleeping arrangements have been commented upon by both Charles Dickens in his ‘Pickwick Papers’, which were published in 1936, and George Orwell’s work ‘Down and Out in London and Paris’ published in 1933, which he wrote whilst living as a vagrant for research. It is unsurprising that these scenarios are used in fiction as they do sound fanciful but as is often the case, the truth is stranger than the fiction.</p><p> 查尔斯·狄更斯（Charles Dickens）在1936年出版的《皮克威克论文》（Pickwick Papers）和1933年出版的乔治·奥威尔（George Orwell）的作品《在伦敦和巴黎的倒下》中都评论了这些特殊的睡眠安排，他在游荡的时候写作用于研究。毫无疑问的是，这些场景在小说中使用时听起来确实很虚构，但是通常情况下，事实比小说更奇怪。</p><p>  “The Twopenny Hangover. This comes a little higher than the Embankment. At the Twopenny Hangover, the lodgers sit in a row on a bench; there is a rope in front of them, and they lean on this as though leaning over a fence. A man, humorously called the valet, cuts the rope at five in the morning.”    –	‘Down and Out in London and Paris’ George Orwell.’</p><p>  “ Twopenny宿醉。这比路堤高一点。在Twopenny Hangover，房客连续坐在长椅上。他们前面有一根绳子，他们靠在这上面，好像在篱笆上倾斜。一个被幽默地称为“代客”的人在早上五点切断绳索。” –‘在伦敦和巴黎上下走走’乔治·奥威尔（George Orwell）。</p><p> “The Coffin, at fourpence a night. At the Coffin you sleep in a wooden box, with a tarpaulin for covering. It is cold, and the worst thing about it are the bugs, which, being enclosed in a box, you cannot escape.”    – ‘Down and Out in London and Paris, George Orwell.’</p><p> “棺材，每晚四便士。在棺材里，你睡在一个木箱里，上面铺着防水油布。天气很冷，最糟糕的是虫子，它们被装在一个盒子里，无法逃脱。” –‘乔治·奥威尔（George Orwell）在伦敦和巴黎游荡。” </p><p> “And pray, Sam, what is the twopenny rope?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick. ‘The twopenny rope, sir,’ replied Mr. Weller, ‘is just a cheap lodgin’ house, where the beds is twopence a night.’ ‘What do they call a bed a rope for?’ said Mr. Pickwick…They has two ropes, ’bout six foot apart, and three from the floor, which goes right down the room; and the beds are made of slips of coarse sacking, stretched across ’em.’ ‘Well,’ said Mr. Pickwick. ‘Well,’ said Mr. Weller, ‘the adwantage o’ the plan’s hobvious. At six o’clock every mornin’ they let’s go the ropes at one end, and down falls the lodgers.”    – ‘The Pickwick Papers’, Charles Dickens.’</p><p>“然后祈祷，山姆，那条两分钱的绳子是什么？”皮克威克先生问。 韦勒先生回答说：“先生，两便士的绳索，只是一间便宜的旅馆，那里的床子每晚一便士。”“他们称床为绳索是什么？”皮克威克先生说……他们有 两根绳子，相距六英尺，三根绳子在地板上，三根绳子正好穿过房间。 皮克威克先生说，这些床是用粗麻布的纸条铺成的，铺在“ em”上。 韦勒先生说：“嗯，”该计划的好处是很愚蠢的。 每天早上六点钟，他们都将绳子的一端拉开，然后倒下房客。” –‘The Pickwick Papers，查尔斯·狄更斯（Charles Dickens）。’ </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.historic-uk.com/CultureUK/Two-Penny-Hangover/">https://www.historic-uk.com/CultureUK/Two-Penny-Hangover/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/维多利亚/">#维多利亚</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/penny/">#penny</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/棺材/">#棺材</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
