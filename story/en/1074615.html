Maybe tried it once or twice.   My impression: its cool, but would not want to use it for more than 30 min. The weight of the hardware disorientation are the reasons.   My workplace has no need for VR because our products dont even crossover with that sort of technology. However in the seattle, wa area I do have friends and distant contacts that work with VR in a capacity.   One works in meta/facebook as a ee contractor. Majority of engineers in their redmond, wa office are contractors from what my friend told me.   Another is a mechanical engineer in valve at bellevue. Valve is pretty tight-lipped with their operations obviously, but they are really investing into hardware that includes vr.   Its popular here but personally not involved in it.</p><p>我在增强现实方面的经验非常有限。也许试过一两次。我的印象是：它很酷，但我不想使用它超过30分钟。硬件的重量让人迷失方向是原因。我的工作场所不需要虚拟现实，因为我们的产品甚至都不与这种技术交叉。然而，在华盛顿州西雅图地区，我确实有朋友和远方的联系人，他们以虚拟现实的身份工作。其中一人在meta/facebook担任ee承包商。华盛顿州雷德蒙德办公室的大多数工程师都是我朋友告诉我的承包商。另一位是bellevue的阀门机械工程师。Valve显然对他们的操作守口如瓶，但他们真的在投资包括虚拟现实在内的硬件。它在这里很受欢迎，但个人并未参与其中。</p><p> Yes we sometimes use an ar-enable remote assistance software and it works like this, an on-site technician(me) needs help, the technician will receive a link from a expert to initiate a video call so the expert can see what the technician sees. Then the technician receives a guidance enable with the help of augmented reality and the technician then will see all the instructions and steps to do that one task.</p><p>是的，我们有时会使用ar启用远程协助软件，它的工作原理是这样的，现场技术人员（me）需要帮助，技术人员将收到来自专家的链接以启动视频通话，以便专家可以看到技术人员看到的内容。然后，技术人员在增强现实的帮助下收到一个引导启用，然后技术人员将看到执行该任务的所有说明和步骤。</p><p> People are so excited about augmented reality, but I don&#39;t get it. Much of what a dealer tech does is repetitive, so once you&#39;ve seen something the first time, you don&#39;t need to see it again.   A well-done 2 minute video from the manufacturer would serve just as well. When I have seen it implemented, it&#39;s amazing that you can give someone a ghost image to match up, and they can&#39;t seem to even hold the phone the right way, or do the work correctly.  You mentioned the word &#34;tool&#34; a couple times, and that&#39;s exactly how I see it. I have tools that I only use once or twice a year, and they&#39;re definitely important when a job comes along where I need them.   I think augmented reality is the same - it isn&#39;t going to solve every problem, but it has a small place here and there.</p><p>人们对增强现实如此兴奋，但我不&#39；我不明白。经销商技术人员的很多工作都是重复的，所以一旦你&#39；我第一次看到的东西，你不&#39；我不需要再看一遍。制造商制作的2分钟视频也可以。当我看到它的实施，它&#39；It’令人惊讶的是，你可以给某人一个鬼影来匹配，而他们可以&#39；我似乎连拿电话的方式都不对，工作也做得不对。你提到了&#34；工具&#34；几次&#39；这正是我的看法。我有每年只使用一两次的工具，它们&#39；当一份工作在我需要的地方出现时，你肯定很重要。我认为增强现实技术是一样的——它不是&#39；我不打算解决所有问题，但它在这里和那里都有一个小地方。</p><p> We dont use AR and there is no use for AR in the automotive world. The only thing that would be helpful is 3d wiring diagrams/part diagrams with locations and routing on a vehicle.  But that would be on a desktop monitor, not in some overpriced pair of glasses or holding our phones, with small screens at the car. AR has literally nothing to offer in the field of automotive repair that wouldn&#39;t be better done by a better diagram on a desktop.  Manufacturers have already started using 3d models to illustrate location. I don&#39;t mean those either.   I mean little 3d models that can be spun around.</p><p>我们不使用AR，AR在汽车领域也没有用处。唯一有用的是3d布线图/零件图，其中包含车辆上的位置和路线。但那将是在一个台式显示器上，而不是在一些定价过高的眼镜上，或者拿着我们的手机，车上有小屏幕。AR在汽车维修领域几乎没有什么可以提供的，不会&#39；在桌面上用一个更好的图表做不到更好。制造商已经开始使用3d模型来说明位置。我不&#39；我也不是指那些。我指的是可以旋转的小3d模型。</p><p>  “I think it could be utilised well with gis data and infield asbuilts. I’ve seen people overlaying photos/asbuilt data into head sets so you can “see through” the ground.”</p><p>“我认为它可以很好地与gis数据和内场asbuilt结合使用。我见过人们将照片/ASBUILD数据叠加到头套中，这样你就可以“看穿”地面。”</p><p>  I’ve seen it, and i’d love to see more of it. Mostly at trade shows mainly and on social media.   I think it could be utilised well with gis data and infield asbuilts. I’ve seen people overlaying photos/asbuilt data into head sets so you can “see through” the ground.   It’s an exciting space, I look forward to it becoming more prevalent.</p><p>我已经看过了，我很想看更多。主要是在贸易展和社交媒体上。我认为它可以很好地与gis数据和内场建筑结合使用。我见过人们将照片/内置数据叠加到头套上，这样你就可以“看穿”地面。这是一个令人兴奋的空间，我期待它变得更加流行。</p><p> Unfortunately, no I do not have any experience with augmented reality within any of my jobs. However.   When I was still in the usmc, I saw some boeing representatives working with a VR setup to see and learn and understand a type of engine and where everything was on it and how to get to it. So I think it&#39;s possible that VR is being used by engineers to help bridge a gap between engineers and maintenance personnel to better understand how to design engines and other stuff in a way that it&#39;s not as difficult to repair and operate the equipment or engines.</p><p>不幸的是，不，我在我的任何工作中都没有任何增强现实的经验。然而当我还在美国海军陆战队的时候，我看到一些波音公司的代表正在使用虚拟现实设备来查看、学习和理解一种发动机，以及它上面的所有东西，以及如何到达它。所以我觉得&#39；虚拟现实技术有可能被工程师用来帮助缩小工程师和维护人员之间的差距，从而更好地理解如何设计引擎和其他东西，使其&#39；维修和操作设备或发动机没有那么困难。</p><p> I’ve never seen anyone use AR for a job, at least not in electrical. I know for interior design it’s used, but i’ve never even heard of AR being used for electrical.   Mainly because I don’t see it being useful at all.</p><p>我从来没见过有人用AR做工作，至少在电气行业是这样。我知道在室内设计中会用到AR，但我从没听说过AR被用于电气设计。主要是因为我觉得它一点用都没有。</p><p>  “I know very little about any of it, but I do find the idea of implementing AR technology into day to day life very interesting.”</p><p>“我对这些都知之甚少，但我确实觉得将AR技术应用到日常生活中的想法非常有趣。”</p><p> I have some experience but not with using it. I design instrumentation and electrical systems for a specific use and we incorporate some augmented reality into the design for the benefit of the end operator and servicing.   Though that&#39;s not my speciality, we have people who specialise in those things, I just help define where they could be useful.</p><p>我有一些经验，但不会使用它。我为特定用途设计仪器和电气系统，我们在设计中加入了一些增强现实技术，以利于终端操作员和服务。尽管如此&#39；这不是我的专长，我们有专门研究这些东西的人，我只是帮助定义它们在哪里有用。</p><p> I&#39;ve had no experience at all with any type of augmented reality stuff unfortunately. Basically zero experience with VR stuff too myself.   Other than watching stuff like google glass pop up years ago and basic things like phone aps (pokemon go etc.) Certainly nothing close to that during my time working in defence manufacturing.   I know very little about any of it, but I do find the idea of implementing AR technology into day to day life very interesting.  I think the jump to VR was too much for the tech at the time.   Should have focussed more on AR years ago. VR seems to be better now, but AR has some amazing possibilities of real world applications.   I&#39;d love to see heads up displays inside car windows, like fighter jets. I love those apps (if they&#39;re around, I assume they are) that let you see where/how your furniture could fit inside an empty room, like when your inspecting a rental/empty house, you could quickly check how your pre-scanned furniture would fill the space.</p><p>我&#39；不幸的是，我对任何类型的增强现实技术都没有经验。基本上我自己也没有虚拟现实方面的经验。在我从事国防制造业期间，除了观看几年前弹出的谷歌眼镜（google glass）和手机aps（pokemon go等）等基本功能外，肯定没有什么能与之媲美。我对这些都知之甚少，但我确实觉得将AR技术应用到日常生活中的想法非常有趣。我认为对当时的科技来说，跳转到虚拟现实是太过分了。几年前就应该更加关注AR。VR现在似乎更好了，但AR在现实世界中有一些惊人的应用可能性。我&#39；I’我喜欢在车窗内看到正面显示，比如战斗机。我喜欢那些应用程序（如果它们&#39；在附近，我想它们是的），它们可以让你看到你的家具可以放在一个空房间里的位置/方式，比如当你检查一个出租/空房子时，你可以快速检查预扫描的家具将如何填满空间。</p><p>  “Technician need to locate problems from the electronics/electrical to mechanical parts. Would save our time and a lot of advantages not just for us but our industry.”</p><p>“技术人员需要定位从电子/电气到机械部件的问题。这将节省我们的时间，并为我们和我们的行业带来很多优势。”</p><p> No, I haven&#39;t at all. Skirted around the edges having been involved with digital and hd development in the early 90s.   Been mostly telecom since.</p><p>不，我没有&#39；一点也不。在90年代早期参与了数字和高清开发。从那时起，它主要是电信业务。</p><p>  No I haven&#39;t used AR in my current position. There is no current need for AR as seeing the full control network through a pair of glasses would be chaotic haha although a basic AR for potential fault finding and system overlay would be great.   Though not used by myself it is something we do offer to customers for hand picking operations. Initially it was just a voice guide to help the worker find a location quicker but now with a visual que it has a significant effect on production times.   As for vr, yes it is something we use to design and build a fully self sustaining logistics system. With VR it allows our engineers to see first hand how the system will operate within the confines of the facility and get maximum space all while constructing and modifying to the clients needs.   Once constructed the client is free to walk the system and give their input. I hope this give you abit of an insight but I&#39;m afraid that is all the information I have.  As technology advances the equipment will become cheaper to make and become more consumer friendly. At the moment its really only the largest of corporations that have integrated it like pharmaceuticals and such.</p><p>不，我没有&#39；我在目前的职位上没有使用AR。目前不需要AR，因为通过一副眼镜看到完整的控制网络会很混乱，哈哈，尽管基本的AR对于潜在的故障发现和系统覆盖来说是很好的。虽然不是我自己用的，但我们确实为客户提供手工采摘操作。起初，它只是一个语音指南，帮助工人更快地找到一个位置，但现在有了视觉效果，它对生产时间产生了重大影响。至于虚拟现实，是的，它是我们用来设计和构建一个完全自我维持的物流系统的东西。通过虚拟现实技术，我们的工程师可以直接看到系统将如何在设施范围内运行，并在根据客户需求进行构建和修改的同时获得最大的空间。一旦构建完成，客户就可以自由地浏览系统并给出他们的输入。我希望这能给你一点启发，但我&#39；I’恐怕我掌握的信息就这些了。随着技术的进步，设备的制造成本将变得更低，对消费者更加友好。目前只有最大的公司整合了它，比如制药公司等等。</p><p> I enjoy sharing the knowledge i’ve acquired in the trades i’ve worked in first hand! However, sadly to say, augmented reality doesn’t pertain to my field of expertise, actually. Industrial automation, more so, refers to digital-to-mechanical operations.   One large example you may be familiar with is a cnc “machine”. The controllers, drives, motors, auxiliary, etc.   All make up different types of user-controlled automation; and it just so happens to be widely used in industrial work. That can refer to processing plants, warehouse facilities, and even mail services operate industrial automation techniques for processing mail! As to why I don’t, or rather can’t, use augmented reality in my particular line of work is because it’s physically hands-on.   There’s nothing to really be virtual with in this practice, when it comes to fixing real-world problems on real-world devices. It takes a specific level of consciousness to be able to diagnose and repair these units - that no machine would be cable of doing, just because they have no way of connecting and monitoring equipment from as early as the 1960’s (or sometimes earlier!).   For those who could use augmented reality, however, it would be interesting to see contractors utilizing it in the field! I’ve always had over a decade of framing houses with my step father, so i’ve also built from the foundation to the roof. But being able to kind of see an augmented house on the plot you’re building, before it’s done, would be extremely cool to experience - and I imagine that it could actually benefit architects, being able to see the possibilities before they’re built.   Although, admittedly, this is partially already done in modeling software - adding the actual scene to the visualization, i’d imagine, could help.</p><p>我喜欢分享我在第一手工作的行业中获得的知识！然而，遗憾的是，事实上，增强现实并不属于我的专业领域。更重要的是，工业自动化指的是从数字到机械的操作。你可能熟悉的一个大例子是cnc“机器”。控制器、驱动器、电机、辅助设备等都构成了不同类型的用户控制自动化；它恰好被广泛应用于工业生产中。这可以指的是处理工厂、仓库设施，甚至是邮件服务，使用工业自动化技术来处理邮件！至于我为什么不，或者更确切地说，不能在我的特定工作领域使用增强现实技术，是因为它是实际操作的。在这种实践中，当涉及到在现实世界的设备上解决现实世界的问题时，没有什么真正需要虚拟的。诊断和维修这些设备需要一定的意识水平——没有任何机器能够做到这一点，仅仅因为早在20世纪60年代（或更早的时候！）它们就无法连接和监控设备。然而，对于那些能够使用增强现实技术的人来说，看到承包商在现场使用它将是一件有趣的事情！我和我的继父一直都有十多年的房子，所以我也从地基到屋顶。但是，在建造之前，能够在你正在建造的地块上看到一座扩建的房子，这将是一种非常酷的体验——我想这实际上会让建筑师受益，能够在建造之前看到可能性。虽然，不可否认，这部分已经在建模软件中完成了——我想，将实际场景添加到可视化中可能会有所帮助。</p><p> Experience with AR at work? No. But I know how it works and would love to implement AR into our work.   Technician need to locate problems from the electronics/electrical to mechanical parts. Would save our time and a lot of advantages not just for us but our industry.</p><p>有AR工作经验吗？没有。但我知道它是如何工作的，我很想在我们的工作中实施AR。技师需要定位从电子/电气到机械部件的问题。将节省我们的时间和许多优势，不仅对我们，而且对我们的行业。</p><p> I actually don&#39;t have any experience with it, professionally nor personally. I do find AR to be a fascinating thing, however.   When googleglass was a thing, I believed that it would have been revolutionary.  Unfortunately the space needed for all that processing is just too bulky, and trying to save space by transmitting it to a phone to process on it, then to send it back up to display seems like it free up space no longer needed to process, but just fills it back up with transmitters instead.   Plus, the horrors of what that would do for battery life hahaha.</p><p>我其实不知道&#39；我没有任何这方面的经验，无论是专业还是个人。然而，我确实发现AR是一件令人着迷的事情。当谷歌眼镜成为一种东西时，我相信它会是革命性的。不幸的是，所有这些处理所需的空间实在太大了，为了节省空间，将其传输到手机上进行处理，然后将其发送回显示器，这似乎释放了不再需要处理的空间，而只是用发射机将其填满。另外，这会对电池寿命造成什么样的可怕影响，哈哈哈。</p><p> I love the idea of VR and in my various experiments have built cool 3d interfaces that were soundly rejected. Typical users of scada are in a fantastically stodgy industry.   Change is bad might as well be their company mottos. One of the biggest pipeline companies in the world uses a 35 year old scada system.   One operations manager told me not to bother with touchscreen interfaces because operators hate lifting their arms. Every major scada upgrade that I have seen was born of extreme necessity.   One vax/vms based system was upgraded due to the hardware no longer having backups; otherwise they would have happily left it running for years more. Other systems were upgraded because the capacity of the old system could not accommodate newly purchased assets needing control.   Support companies dropping support sometimes happens, and drives an upgrade. Regulatory requirements might drive an upgrade but in most industries they can usually add procedures to compensate for the system being crap.   For example terrible encryption might be compensated for by using better networking gear that lets the crap data go through an encrypted network. A requirement to properly encrypt a database might be done by moving the old crap system which can’t encrypt squat onto a vm which was set to run on an encrypted drive.   Even something as basic as using vms is resisted except for where it buys more life for the old crap. Solaris can run on a vm on new hardware as few modern servers will run solaris anymore.   Often with scada systems you will see all these schematic type screens. Often tucked away in some corner is a screen the operators really look at.   It will have a list of a few critical numbers such as a pressure that is the number they chase. This might be one sensor in 500.   The rest are meaningless to them most of the time. Alarms are also coming by the truckload and usually silenced/ignored in some form.   The only time the wholistic view comes into play is when something goes wrong. Then they look at things like schematics to see what is happening.   My company builds tools which can save 100s of millions usd per year for many companies. They don’t want them.   They would prefer things in their world view. They would love to save money paying rent.   They would love to finance new operations at a lower interest rate. They would love to reduce headcount.   But tell them they can run their equipment slightly differently resulting in more output at less cost and they are confused. Isn’t their system running at top efficiency? But we have a report from our engineers saying it is.   Where VR might be a sell is for existing scada vendors to fool the non operators into buying it. For example one lrt control room I was in had giant monitors running more than halfway around the room with a mix of train positions and security videos.   It was very impressive. Nobody used it or wanted it.   The system was done up in artist renderings of the control room by the winning company where they convinced city staff this was what a control room of the future looked like. It looked good on tv and for tours.   As an example of the sort of problem doing a truly new scada is to watch an existing deployment do a minor upgrade. Everyone holds their breath, crosses their fingers and rubs their lucky charm; hoping they won’t be writing the report as to why the whole infrastructure shutdown that day.   Now convince them to multiply that stress by 1 million. Then add the misery of how they view what is genuinely better as worse.   On this last I could go on for hours more.</p><p>我喜欢虚拟现实的想法，在我的各种实验中，我构建了被彻底拒绝的酷炫3d界面。scada的典型用户处于一个极其乏味的行业。改变不好也可能是他们公司的座右铭。世界上最大的管道公司之一使用了一个有35年历史的scada系统。一位运营经理告诉我不要为触摸屏界面操心，因为运营商讨厌举起手臂。我所看到的每一次重大scada升级都是出于极端的需要。一个基于vax/vms的系统升级，因为硬件不再有备份；否则，他们会很高兴让它继续运行多年。其他系统进行了升级，因为旧系统的容量无法容纳需要控制的新购买资产。支持公司有时会放弃支持，并推动升级。监管要求可能会推动升级，但在大多数行业，他们通常可以添加程序来补偿系统的垃圾。例如，通过使用更好的网络设备，让垃圾数据通过加密网络，可以补偿糟糕的加密。正确加密数据库的要求可以通过将不能加密Shuck的旧垃圾系统移动到设置为在加密驱动器上运行的vm上来实现。即使是像使用虚拟机这样基本的东西也会受到抵制，除非它能为旧的垃圾带来更多的生命。Solaris可以在新硬件上的vm上运行，因为很少有现代服务器会再运行Solaris。通常，在scada系统中，您会看到所有这些示意图类型的屏幕。通常隐藏在某个角落里的是操作人员真正看到的屏幕。它将列出一些关键数字，比如他们所追求的压力。这可能是500个传感器中的一个。其余的大部分时间对他们来说毫无意义。警报也来自卡车，通常以某种形式被静音/忽略。只有在出现问题时，整体观点才会发挥作用。然后他们会看一些图表，看看发生了什么。我的公司生产的工具每年可以为许多公司节省1亿美元。他们不想要。他们更喜欢他们的世界观。他们愿意省钱付房租。他们希望以较低的利率为新业务融资。他们希望减少员工人数。但是告诉他们，他们可以以稍微不同的方式运行设备，从而以更低的成本获得更多的产出，他们会感到困惑。他们的系统不是运行得很高效吗？但我们的工程师报告说确实如此。虚拟现实可能会被现有的监控与数据采集系统供应商用来欺骗非运营商购买。例如，我所在的一个轻轨控制室有一个巨大的监视器，在房间的一半以上运行，其中混合了火车位置和安全视频。非常令人印象深刻。没有人使用或想要它。该系统是由获胜的公司在控制室的艺术家渲染中完成的，他们让城市工作人员相信这就是未来控制室的样子。它在电视上和旅游中都很好看。作为一个例子，一个真正新的scada系统的问题是观察一个现有的部署做一个小的升级。每个人都屏住呼吸，交叉手指，摩擦自己的幸运符；希望他们不会写报告，解释为什么那天整个基础设施都关闭了。现在说服他们将压力乘以100万。然后再加上他们如何看待真正好的东西是坏的痛苦。在这最后一刻，我可以再坚持几个小时。</p><p> I personally haven&#39;t had a need for AR but my work hasn&#39;t leant itself to that level of sophistication. Most of the challenges that, in my mind, AR solves involve immediate information presentation the likes of which my technicians simply don&#39;t benefit from.   My guys are fabricating consumer and commercial goods from metal, not building the space shuttle or dealing with chemicals in a tank. I&#39;m sure a savvy salesman could justify several use cases at my plant but the capital expenditure outweighs the benefit at this time.</p><p>我个人没有&#39；我不需要AR，但我的工作没有#39；Don’不要把自己的水平提高到那种复杂的程度。在我看来，AR解决的大多数挑战都涉及即时信息展示，而我的技术人员根本不需要这种展示；我不能从中受益。我的人正在用金属制造消费品和商业产品，而不是建造航天飞机或在坦克中处理化学品。我&#39；我相信一个精明的推销员可以证明我工厂的几个使用案例是合理的，但此时的资本支出大于收益。</p><p> We don&#39;t use augmented reality currently, but I could see how it would be useful in manufacturing assisting in assembly.  If a company comes up with a solution for AR cad it would be a game changer for quality and manufacturing through put.   Auto updates for new revisions with alerts, now that would be a dream.</p><p>我们没有&#39；我目前还没有使用增强现实技术，但我可以看到它在制造业和辅助装配方面是多么有用。如果一家公司提出了AR cad的解决方案，它将改变质量和生产的游戏规则。自动更新新版本的提醒，现在这将是一个梦想。</p><p>  “The little time I played around with it, I could see it being a big benefit for maintenance and construction workers, also engineers.”</p><p>“我玩它的时间很短，我就可以看到它对维护和建筑工人，以及工程师都是一大好处。”</p><p> Ar is not present in most of the manufacturing environments. The closest thing to AR I ever use at work is a thermal imaging camera to see hotspots, and even then a thermal gun is easier for anything other than troubleshooting as I usually know what I&#39;m looking for.</p><p>Ar在大多数制造环境中都不存在。我在工作中使用过的最接近AR的东西是一台热成像相机，可以看到热点，即使这样，热枪也比故障排除更容易，因为我通常知道我&#39；我在找。</p><p> No I don’t. Before I went on my own as a independent contractor my old company was just scratching the surface with augmented reality.   It was a hard hat with a built in eye piece that would help indicate what you were looking at, in my case it was at a dairy filling plant. The little time I played around with it, I could see it being a big benefit for maintenance and construction workers, also engineers.</p><p>不，我不知道。在我作为独立承包商独立工作之前，我的老公司只是用增强现实技术进行初步探索。这是一顶带有内置眼罩的安全帽，可以帮助你显示你在看什么，在我的例子中，它是在一家乳制品灌装厂。我玩它的时间很短，我可以看到它对维护和建筑工人，以及工程师都是一个巨大的好处。</p><p>   “I imagine in a industrial setting it would provide a ergonomic solution to a more efficient productivity.”</p><p>“我想，在工业环境中，它将提供一个符合人体工程学的解决方案，以提高生产率。”</p><p> Augmented reality was no part of the industry I worked in. We dealt with manufacturing and repair/reman of industrial gantry crane machines, rail jack machines, and assembling hydraulic manifolds, lines, and cylinders.</p><p>增强现实技术不是我工作的行业的一部分。我们从事工业龙门起重机机器、轨道千斤顶机器的制造和维修/再制造，以及液压歧管、管路和气缸的组装。</p><p> I have never used augmented reality in day to day operations for a number of reasons, but namely because the technology, while beneficial in many ways, is still in its infancy and therefore will not easily be embraced by companies who are still using windows xp for human interfaces and obsolete plc&#39;s to power their aging machinery. The money is being invested poorly because the primary focus is to maintain existing equipment instead of innovate and implement new technologies.   In a nutshell, innovation is seen as a risky investment when a less efficient investment is a safer bet.</p><p>我从未在日常操作中使用增强现实技术，原因有很多，但也就是说，这项技术虽然在很多方面都很有用，但仍处于起步阶段，因此不容易被仍在使用windows xp进行人机界面和过时plc的公司所接受；让他们为老化的机器提供动力。资金投入不足，因为主要重点是维护现有设备，而不是创新和实施新技术。简而言之，当效率较低的投资更安全时，创新被视为一种风险投资。</p><p> I&#39;ve never used augmented reality but it has got me wondering. We did have tablets we carried around.   Tablets insured less paper usage and a quick access to engineer drawings, email and scanning off time towards work orders. I&#39;ve worked a lot with cad models in solidworks and built very large slip rings.   Being able to go into solidworks and move the model around, subtract items and cut the model up how ever I liked was much more helpful than the guess work that would come from just looking at the engineer drawing. Augmented reality seems like it would be a more efficient aspect of that.   Being able to walk around, compare and get a good visual. I collaborated with engineers often on design and best approach at dealing with a problem.   When answering questions I would frequently construct and deconstruct things in my mind. I believe being able to give a visual with augmented reality, could provide a better understanding of ideas but then again, we had cad models which pretty much did the same thing.   Though I never worked with augmented reality, there is a app I enjoy, skyview. It allows you to view the stars, planets and constellations and provides interesting information with the use of the camera on your phone.   I imagine in a industrial setting it would provide a ergonomic solution to a more efficient productivity.</p><p>我&#39；我从未使用过增强现实技术，但它让我好奇。我们确实有随身携带的药片。平板电脑保证了更少的纸张使用量，并能快速访问工程师图纸、电子邮件和扫描工单。我&#39；我在solidworks中大量使用cad模型，并制作了非常大的滑环。能够进入solidworks，移动模型，减去项目，然后按照我喜欢的方式切割模型，这比仅仅看工程师的图纸所做的猜测工作要有用得多。增强现实技术似乎是其中一个更有效的方面。能够四处走动、比较并获得良好的视觉效果。我经常与工程师合作设计和处理问题的最佳方法。在回答问题时，我会经常在脑海中构建和解构事物。我相信，能够通过增强现实技术提供视觉效果，可以更好地理解各种想法，但同样，我们有cad模型，它们基本上做了同样的事情。虽然我从未使用过增强现实技术，但我喜欢一款应用程序skyview。它允许你查看恒星、行星和星座，并使用手机上的摄像头提供有趣的信息。我想在工业环境中，它将提供一个符合人体工程学的解决方案，以提高生产率。</p><p>  “I’ve seen small scale implementation of what I think could be very useful augmented reality where qr codes are put on pumps/motors/tanks to link you to maintenance history/documentation and equipment specs”</p><p>“我看到过一种小规模的增强现实技术，我认为这种技术非常有用，在泵/马达/油箱上放置二维码，将您与维护历史/文档和设备规格联系起来。”</p><p> I personally have not worked with an augmented reality device. I interviewed with a company that used them as an interface between techician and engineer and I thought their configuration was very promising.   In my current line of work I dont think that an AR device could survive the environment, but im definitely positive about the benefits it could provide to tec</p><p>我个人还没有使用过增强现实设备。我采访了一家将它们用作技术人员和工程师之间接口的公司，我认为它们的配置非常有前景。在我目前的工作中，我不认为AR设备能在环境中生存，但我肯定它能为tec带来好处</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/增强/">#增强</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/augmented/">#augmented</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/ar/">#ar</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
