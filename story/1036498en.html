Birds are thinkers who look at the big picture and survey the landscape from a great height. Frogs are thinkers who love playing around in the mud of specific problems, delighting in finding gems and then polishing them so that they become part of the superstructure that birds survey. Einstein was a bird, Hubble was a frog. Science needs both birds and frogs for its progress, but there are cases in which one kind of creature is more important than another.</p><p>我无耻地借用了我的导师和朋友弗里曼·戴森（Freeman Dyson）关于数学中的鸟类和青蛙的精彩演讲。鸟类是思想者，他们可以看到全景并从高空俯瞰风景。青蛙是思想家，他们喜欢在特定问题的泥泞中嬉戏，喜欢寻找宝石，然后对其进行抛光，使其成为鸟类调查的上层建筑的一部分。爱因斯坦是鸟，哈勃是青蛙。科学需要鸟类和青蛙才能取得进步，但是在某些情况下，一种生物比另一种更为重要。</p><p> Most of the great thinkers in physics of ancient times were birds. They went by the name of natural philosophers. The fact that they were birds speaks both to the raw state of scientific knowledge at that time and the attitude that these thinkers had toward what we call science, an attitude that we should resurrect. Aristotle, Plato, Newton and Kepler saw science as a seamless part of a worldview that included religion. Many of them were alchemists and astrologers. Unlike many scientists today, they saw no conflict between science and mysticism and believed both to be created by God for man to study. Newton was a supreme bird, seeing Nature as a book written by God, a puzzle whose solutions had room for both calculus and alchemy, both gravitation and an Arian rejection of the Holy Trinity. Newton kept his Arian convictions secret for fear of persecution, but there is no doubt in his own mind that they were as legitimate as his scientific inquiries. At the beginning of the third volume of his famous Principia, Newton said, “It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the system of the world”, leaving no doubt either about his ambition or his grand birdlike worldview.</p><p> 古代物理学中大多数伟大的思想家都是鸟类。他们以自然哲学家的名义去了。他们是鸟类这一事实既说明了当时的科学知识的原始状态，也说明了这些思想家对我们所谓的科学的态度，这是我们应该复活的态度。亚里斯多德，柏拉图，牛顿和开普勒将科学视为包括宗教在内的世界观的无缝部分。他们中许多是炼金术士和占星家。与当今的许多科学家不同，他们没有看到科学与神秘主义之间的冲突，并且认为两者都是由上帝创造出来供人类研究的。牛顿是一只至高无上的鸟，他把自然看作上帝所写的书，这是一个难题，其解决方案既有微积分和炼金术的空间，也有引力和阿里安对三位一体的拒绝。牛顿因担心遭受迫害而将他的阿里安信念保密，但毫无疑问，他的信念与他的科学调查一样合法。牛顿在他着名的《原理》第三卷的开头说：“仍然是基于同样的原则，我现在展示了世界体系”，毫无疑问他的雄心壮志或他宏伟的鸟状世界观。</p><p> Even before Newton, Francis Bacon who can rightly be called the father of the modern scientific method of fact-finding and theorizing was a superb frog. Bacon rejected the Aristotelian theorizing that had characterized much of the history of science before him and said, “All depends on keeping the eye fixed upon the facts of Nature, for God forbid that we may give out a dream of our own imagination for a pattern of the world.”</p><p> 即使在牛顿之前，也可以被称为事实发现和理论化现代科学方法之父的弗朗西斯·培根（Francis Bacon）是一只精妙的青蛙。培根拒绝了亚里士多德的理论，该理论在他之前就具有许多科学历史的特征，他说：“一切都取决于对自然事实的关注，因为上帝禁止我们对图案做出自己的想象力梦想世界的。”</p><p> Bacon firmly believed that the way to know more about Nature is to go out there and seek facts. We can build theories only after we have enough facts, which is still the way science generally works. The contrast to Bacon was Descartes, a prominent bird who famously said, “I think, therefore I am”. Descartes put a premium on thought, Bacon on fact-finding. As the somewhat apocryphal story goes, Bacon met his end while investigating the effects of cold on a  chicken, thus revealing the flip side of fact-finding. Experimenters have it hard.</p><p> 培根坚信，要了解更多关于自然的方法就是到那里去寻找事实。只有拥有足够的事实，我们才能建立理论，这仍然是科学通常运作的方式。与培根形成鲜明对比的是笛卡尔（笛卡尔），他是著名的鸟类，他曾说过：“我想，所以我就是”。笛卡尔重视思想，培根重视事实调查。随着有些古怪的故事的流逝，培根在研究感冒对鸡肉的影响时遇到了终点，从而揭示了事实调查的另一面。实验者很难。</p><p>  It is interesting to ask if birds and frogs in physics can be broadly classified. The boundaries can be fluid, but generally speaking, Cartesian thinkers tend to be birds while Baconian doers tend to be frogs. This is partly because thinking about a broad landscape of ideas is easier than getting your hands dirty even on a single, well-crafted scientific experiment. Similarly, physicists who are unifiers tend to be birds, while physicists who are diversifiers tend to be frogs. One of the great and continuing themes in the history of physics is that of unifying different theories and different forces of nature. For instance it took a bevy of birds like Rudolf Clausius, Gustav Kirchhoff, Sadi Carnot, Lord Kelvin and Willard Gibbs to unify the phenomena of mechanics and heat, inaugurating the science of thermodynamics. Around the same time, the great James Clerk Maxwell was inaugurating the science of electromagnetism by unifying electricity and magnetism. Maxwell was building on the foundational work done by Michael Faraday who had proved that electric fields can generate magnetic fields and vice versa.</p><p>  有趣的是，物理学上的鸟类和青蛙是否可以广义地分类。边界是可变的，但总的来说，笛卡尔思想家倾向于鸟类，而培根主义者则倾向于青蛙。部分原因是，即使是在一个精心设计的科学实验中，思考广泛的思想观念也比弄污双手要容易得多。同样，作为统一者的物理学家往往是鸟类，而作为多样化者的物理学家往往是青蛙。物理学史上伟大而持续的主题之一就是统一不同理论和不同自然力的主题。例如，鲁道夫·克劳修斯（Rudolf Clausius），古斯塔夫·基希霍夫（Gustav Kirchhoff），萨迪·卡诺（Sadi Carnot），开尔文勋爵（Lord Kelvin）和威拉德·吉布斯（Willard Gibbs）等大批鸟类将力学和热现象统一起来，开创了热力学科学的先河。大约在同一时间，伟大的詹姆斯·克莱克·麦克斯韦（James Clerk Maxwell）通过统一电和磁来开创电磁学。麦克斯韦以迈克尔·法拉第（Michael Faraday）所做的基础工作为基础，他证明了电场可以产生磁场，反之亦然。</p><p> But the example of Faraday, Carnot and Gibbs raise the interesting possibility of a new creature – the frogbird. Frogbirds are an exotic and rare species who start out as frogs, but who through their persistent and creative frog-like explorations inevitably turn into birds. In one of the very few examples of an engineer making fundamental contributions to science, Carnot was trying to find out the maximum efficiency of heat engines when these investigations led him to a fundamental law of nature – the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Faraday was a modest experimenter who loved getting his hands dirty with string and sealing wax. His main goal was to do simple experiments which would help him understand phenomena like the electric decomposition of salts. This research philosophy had been inspired by his mentor Humphrey Davy who had investigated the effects of laughing gas and discovered many new elements in bursts of frog-hopping. But Faraday discovered much more through his experiments than what he might have hoped for, glimpsing a hidden symmetry in the laws of nature, a symmetry that Maxwell was to fully exploit. Willard Gibbs also started out as a highly skilled theoretical frog, manipulating vector calculus to study specific thermodynamic phenomena. In the process, he became the father of statistical mechanics, and his contributions were so deep that Einstein called him the greatest mind in American science. But Gibbs was an exceedingly shy frogbird,  publishing his great theory in an obscure Connecticut journal and quietly working until the end of his life at Yale University. His reputation as a bird was resurrected by others after his death.</p><p> 但以法拉第，卡诺（Carnot）和吉布斯（Gibbs）为例，提出了一种新生物–蛙鸟的有趣可能性。蛙鸟是一种外来物种，稀有物种，最初起源于青蛙，但通过对青蛙的持续不断和创造性的探索，它们不可避免地变成了鸟类。在工程师为科学做出基本贡献的极少数例子中，当这些研究使卡诺得出自然界的基本定律即热力学第二定律时，卡诺试图找出热机的最大效率。法拉第（Faraday）是一位谦虚的实验者，他喜欢用绳子和密封蜡弄污双手。他的主要目标是进行简单的实验，以帮助他理解诸如盐的电分解之类的现象。这种研究哲学的灵感来自他的导师汉弗莱·戴维（Humphrey Davy），他研究了笑气的影响并发现了许多蛙跳现象的新元素。但是法拉第通过他的实验发现了比他期望的更多的东西，瞥见了自然定律中隐藏的对称性，这是麦克斯韦要充分利用的对称性。威拉德·吉布斯（Willard Gibbs）也是一位技术娴熟的理论青蛙，他操纵矢量演算来研究特定的热力学现象。在此过程中，他成为统计力学之父，他的贡献如此之深，以至于爱因斯坦称他为美国科学界最伟大的头脑。但是吉布斯是一个非常害羞的青蛙鸟，他在不起眼的康涅狄格州杂志上发表了他的伟大理论，并悄悄地工作到他在耶鲁大学的生命尽头。他去世后，他的鸟名声被其他人复活。</p><p>  As the 20th century dawned, physics started becoming more specialized and it started becoming harder for physicists to be birds. But a classic frogbird at the beginning of the century set in motion a series of events that paved the way for the greatest bird of the century. Working at the turn of the century, Max Planck embarked on a desperate mathematical fix to rescue the thermodynamics of black body radiation. Part of Planck’s efforts came from helping out the German lightbulb industry which was trying to maximize the efficiency of their filaments. Trying to explain the emission of energy by a blackbody, Planck made the inspired suggestion that the only way to explain the data was to assume that the energy was emitted in small chunks called quanta. The chunks were exceedingly small and could be quantified by a tiny parameter which came to be called Planck’s constant. Planck was a conservative physicist, and by his own account he wasn’t trying to create a new theory but simply trying to explain some odd results. In fact, contrary to what the public thinks sparks great scientific discoveries, breakthroughs in science often happen when someone tries to explain a mundane but persistently odd phenomenon, say the beak of a specific bird, the anomaly of a specific planet’s orbit or the behavior of a specific atom like radium. But when Planck explained blackbody radiation using his quanta, all hell broke loose and a new force was unleashed upon the world.</p><p>  20世纪初，物理学开始变得更加专业化，物理学家成为鸟类变得越来越困难。但是，在本世纪初，一只经典的蛙鸟引发了一系列事件，为本世纪最伟大的鸟类铺平了道路。在上世纪之交的工作中，马克斯·普朗克（Max Planck）进行了一次绝望的数学修复，以挽救黑体辐射的热力学。普朗克所做的部分努力来自于帮助德国灯泡行业，该行业试图使灯丝的效率最大化。试图解释黑体发出的能量时，普朗克提出了启发性的建议，即解释数据的唯一方法是假设能量是以称为量子的小块形式发出的。这些块非常小，可以通过一个称为Planck常数的微小参数进行量化。普朗克是位保守的物理学家，据他自己的说法，他并不是试图创造一种新理论，而只是试图解释一些奇怪的结果。实际上，与公众所认为的激发伟大科学发现相反，当有人试图解释一种平凡却持续存在的奇怪现象时，科学上的突破经常发生，例如特定鸟类的喙，特定行星轨道的异常或行星的行为。像镭这样的特定原子但是当普朗克用量子解释黑体辐射时，所有的地狱都崩溃了，世界上释放了新的力量。</p><p> This force partly came in the form of the great bird, Albert Einstein, who in his  annus mirabilis of 1905 wrote five groundbreaking papers, one of which was about the special theory of relativity. Perhaps the more important paper, and one that won him the Nobel Prize later, was an explanation of the photoelectric effect which could only be explained using Planck’s constant. What Planck had thought merely to be a mathematical trick, Einstein found was a crowning edifice in the structure of nature. Einstein was the quintessential bird, thinking of disparate phenomena – the absence of the so-called ether, the speed of light, the specific heat of solids, the unification of Newton’s laws of motion with Maxwell’s theories of electromagnetism. Curiously, one of the foundations of relativity came from a famous experiment by Albert Michaelson and Edward Morley who were frogs extraordinaire. Their careful experiments which failed to find the luminiferous ether through which Maxwell’s electromagnetic waves traveled were masterpieces of frog-like exploration. And yet these experiments enabled the work of the bird Einstein. Later Einstein the bird rose even higher and started to survey the landscape at cosmic scales, trying to make sense of relativity in the context of accelerated frames of motion. This gave rise in 1915 to general relativity, one of the greatest achievements of human thought. To create general relativity, the bird had to soar not just over realms of physics but those of mathematics as well, taking the help of Riemannian geometry to describe curved spacetime. In these efforts Einstein was helped by two very competent frogs, his friends Marcel Grossmann and Michele Besso. Einstein’s  collaboration especially with Grossmann shows that often the best results come when birds collaborate with frogs instead of pecking at them.</p><p>这种力量部分以伟大的鸟类爱因斯坦（Albert Einstein）的形式出现，他在1905年的年度奇迹中写了五篇开创性的论文，其中一篇是关于相对论的。也许更重要的论文，也是后来获得他诺贝尔奖的论文，是对光电效应的一种解释，只能用普朗克常数来解释。爱因斯坦发现，普朗克原以为只是数学上的一招而已，它是自然结构中的最高建筑物。爱因斯坦是最典型的鸟，他想到了不同的现象-所谓的醚的缺失，光速，固体的比热，牛顿的运动定律和麦克斯韦的电磁学理论的统一。奇怪的是，相对论的基础之一来自非凡的青蛙阿尔伯特·迈克尔森和爱德华·莫利的一次著名实验。他们的仔细实验未能找到Maxwell电磁波所通过的发光醚，这是青蛙般探索的杰作。然而，这些实验使爱因斯坦小鸟的工作得以实现。后来爱因斯坦使小鸟升得更高，并开始以宇宙尺度调查景观，试图在加速运动框架的背景下理解相对论。这在1915年引起了相对论，这是人类思想的最大成就。为了建立相对论，这只鸟不仅要飞跃到物理学领域，还必须飞跃到数学领域，借助黎曼几何学来描述弯曲的时空。在这些努力中，爱因斯坦得到了两个非常称职的青蛙的帮助，他的朋友马塞尔·格罗斯曼（Marcel Grossmann）和米歇尔·贝索（Michele Besso）。爱因斯坦特别是与格罗斯曼（Grossmann）的合作表明，当鸟类与青蛙合作而不是啄食青蛙时，通常会取得最佳效果。</p><p>   Later Einstein’s birdlike abilities unfortunately suffered because he failed to take into account all the discoveries frogs were making. He thought that quantum theory was incomplete, and at the end of his life embarked on a quest to come up with a grand unified theory that would unify all the forces of physics. But Einstein was no longer paying attention to the new particles and forces frogs were discovering. Without incorporating these findings in his theories, Einstein’s quest was doomed. Einstein also failed to realize the intense frog-like interest in creations that were logically derived from his own general relativity – black holes. He showed no inclination toward studying them. On the other hand, he was very much interested in the implications of his theory for another supremely important discovery, that of the expansion of the universe. This discovery was made by Edwin Hubble, a formidable frog who liked to sit at his telescope on Mount Wilson on cold nights and plot the speeds and luminosities of nebulae. Hubble was a former boxer-turned-astronomer; one suspects that boxing provides a good foundation for frog-like focus in reducing specific problems to their quivering logical conclusions. But Hubble owed his own work to a set of remarkable frogs working successively at the  Harvard Observatory – women like Henrietta Leavitt, Annie Cannon and Cecilia Payne who were paving the way to a grand theory of the universe by painstakingly cataloging periods and luminosities of thousands of stars. The progression from Leavitt to Einstein to Hubble again shows how the work of frogs and birds inevitably builds on top of each other.</p><p>   不幸的是，后来爱因斯坦的鸟状能力受到了影响，因为他没有考虑到青蛙的所有发现。他认为量子理论是不完整的，在他生命的尽头开始寻求提出一个统一的统一理论，以统一所有物理力。但是爱因斯坦不再关注新的粒子和青蛙发现的力量。没有将这些发现纳入他的理论，爱因斯坦的追求就注定了。爱因斯坦还没有意识到，对逻辑上源自他自己的广义相对论的作品-黑洞-的强烈兴趣就像青蛙一样。他没有倾向研究它们。另一方面，他对他的理论对另一个极其重要的发现即宇宙膨胀的含义非常感兴趣。这项发现是由埃德温·哈勃（Edwin Hubble）做出的，他是一只可怕的青蛙，他喜欢在寒冷的夜晚坐在威尔逊山上的望远镜上，绘制星云的速度和光度。哈勃曾是一名拳击手，后来成为天文学家。一个人怀疑拳击为青蛙般的专注提供了一个良好的基础，可以将特定的问题减少到他们颤抖的逻辑结论中。但是，哈勃将自己的工作归功于在哈佛天文台先后工作的一组杰出的青蛙-亨利埃塔·莱维特（Henrietta Leavitt），安妮·坎农（Annie Cannon）和塞西莉亚·佩恩（Cecilia Payne）之类的女人，通过艰苦的分类周期和成千上万的光度为宇宙的宏大理论铺平了道路星。从莱维特到爱因斯坦再到哈勃的发展再次表明，青蛙和鸟类的工作不可避免地会彼此叠加。</p><p> If Einstein can be called a supreme frog, so can Paul Dirac. But Dirac was a frog whose visions were so grand that they were more similar to the 17th century mysticism of Newton. Dirac was one of the fathers of quantum mechanics who invented an equation of the electron that deduced the existence of a particle with the same mass as the electron but opposite charge. In proposing the existence of these antiparticles, Dirac was going beyond what any frog’s work would imply, deriving rarefied conclusions that could only be supported by mathematics. But Dirac’s birdlike visions were quickly given the twang of reality when Carl Anderson discovered the positron in a cloud chamber. Birds can soar all they want, but even when they see things that others don’t, frogs have to be recruited on the ground to verify what is only a dream. Many of the other fathers of quantum mechanics during the same period were also birds, although it is interesting to note that both Schrödinger and Heisenberg started out as frogs intent on verifying some of the conundrums raised by their illustrious bird-father, Niels Bohr. What Einstein had done for the photoelectric effect Bohr did for atomic structure, catapulting him into the first rank of birds. But Bohr’s theory raised as many questions as it answered because it was exceedingly hard to apply it to atoms more complex than hydrogen and get answers that agreed with experiment. One of the thorniest problems was to explain the thicket of emission and absorption spectra that had served as the basis of Bohr’s work. It was while trying to explain this spectral transition that Heisenberg, while recovering from a bad attack of hay fever on an island in the North Sea, turned into a bird, took flight and invented matrix mechanics which was the first version of quantum mechanics. Similarly, Schrödinger was trying to solve a specific problem, that of finding a wave equation for the matter waves that Louis de Broglie had postulated. In the process he too became a bird.</p><p> 如果爱因斯坦可以被称为至尊青蛙，那么保罗·狄拉克也可以被称为。但是狄拉克是一只青蛙，他的视野是如此宏大，以至于更类似于17世纪的牛顿神秘主义。狄拉克（Dirac）是量子力学之父之一，他发明了一个电子方程，该方程推论出一个质量与电子相同但电荷相反的粒子的存在。在提出这些反粒子的存在时，狄拉克超越了任何青蛙的著作所暗示的范围，得出了只能由数学支持的稀有结论。但是当卡尔·安德森（Carl Anderson）在云室中发现正电子时，狄拉克（Birac）的鸟状异象很快就被现实所吸引。鸟儿可以腾飞所有想要的东西，但是即使他们看到别人看不到的东西，也必须在地面上招募青蛙来验证什么只是梦想。有趣的是，在同一时期，其他许多量子力学之父也是鸟类，尽管有趣的是Schrödinger和Heisenberg都是青蛙来验证他们杰出的鸟类父亲Niels Bohr提出的难题的。爱因斯坦在玻尔对原子结构的光电效应方面所做的工作，使他跃居了鸟类的第一位。但是玻尔的理论提出了许多问题，因为将其应用于比氢更复杂的原子并获得与实验相符的答案非常困难。最棘手的问题之一是解释作为玻尔工作基础的发射和吸收光谱的丛林。正是在试图解释这种光谱转变的过程中，海森堡从北海一个岛上的花粉症的严重袭击中恢复过来，变成了鸟，飞了起来，发明了矩阵力学，这是量子力学的第一个版本。同样，薛定er正试图解决一个特定问题，即为路易斯·德布罗意假定的物质波找到一个波动方程。在这个过程中，他也变成了一只鸟。</p><p>  If Einstein and Bohr were the grand birds of 20th century physics, then Enrico Fermi was the ultimate frog king. There was not a branch of physics Fermi did not touch, but he would have almost certainly thought of himself as first and foremost a frog, trying to solve specific problems with the simplest possible approach. With this philosophy Fermi built the world’s first nuclear reactor and co-invented Fermi-Dirac statistics that explain the behavior of particles with integer spin. But on the way he made a grand birdlike discovery when he came up with a consistent theory of beta decay that would give rise to a new force of nature – the weak force. Fermi’s strength was to look at a specific problem, visualize it physically and then plough straight ahead to solve it using all the mathematical tools at his disposal. Fermi of course was also unique in the annals of 20th century physics in being supremely accomplished in both experimental and theoretical physics.</p><p>  如果说爱因斯坦和玻尔是20世纪物理学的大鸟，那么恩里科·费米就是最终的蛙王。费米没有接触过物理学的一个分支，但是他几乎可以肯定地认为自己是青蛙，并且首先尝试用最简单的方法解决特定的问题。费米秉承这一理念，建造了世界上第一个核反应堆，并共同发明了费米-狄拉克统计数据，用以解释整数自旋粒子的行为。但是在途中，他提出了一个一致的β衰变理论，从而产生了一种新的自然力量-弱力，这一发现使他获得了巨大的鸟类般的发现。费米的专长是看一个特定的问题，对其进行物理可视化，然后直奔前方，使用所有可用的数学工具来解决。当然，费米在20世纪物理学史上也独树一帜，在实验物理学和理论物理学中都取得了卓越的成就。</p><p> Another great frog, and one who Fermi deeply influenced, was Hans Bethe. Just like Fermi, there was not a branch of modern physics Bethe did not touch. Unlike Fermi who died tragically early, Bethe lived into his nineties and his last paper was published after his death in 2005. The term “force of nature” seems to have been coined specifically for Bethe. He was famous for sitting at his desk hour after hour and turning out hundreds of pages of calculations with almost no mistake. No problem would faze him, and his colleagues called him “The Battleship”; a later newspaper profile would describe him as a man “who reduces problems to their essential solutions by the sheer force of his mental artillery.” Just like Fermi he became one of the world’s top nuclear physicists in the 1930s, writing a set of three exhaustive reviews on the state of the art in nuclear physics that were considered so authoritative that they were called Bethe’s Bible. Moving effortlessly from pure to applied physics problems, in 1938 Bethe made his Nobel Prize winning discovery of the nuclear reactions that make the sun shine. It was Bethe’s unsurpassed facility with frog-like problem solving that prompted Robert Oppenheimer to pick him as head of the theoretical division of the Manhattan Project.</p><p> 另一只伟大的青蛙，也是费米深深影响的一只青蛙，是汉斯·贝特（Hans Bethe）。就像费米一样，贝特（Bethe）没有接触过现代物理学的分支。与费米悲剧性地去世不同，贝丝活到90年代，他的最后一篇论文于2005年去世后发表。“自然力量”一词似乎是贝丝专门创造的。他以一个小时接一个小时地坐在办公桌前，几乎无误地完成数百页计算而闻名。没问题会令他震惊，他的同事们称他为“战舰”。后来的报纸资料将他描述为一个“通过他的精神炮兵将问题减少到基本解决方案的人”。就像费米一样，他在1930年代成为世界顶级核物理学家之一，就核物理的最新技术撰写了三份详尽的评论，被认为具有权威性，因此被称为《贝特圣经》。 1938年，贝丝毫不费力地从纯粹的物理问题转移到应用物理问题，他获得了诺贝尔奖，获得了使太阳发光的核反应的发现。正是贝塞斯（Bethe）无与伦比的设施（如青蛙般的问题解决）促使罗伯特·奥本海默（Robert Oppenheimer）选他为曼哈顿项目理论部门的负责人。</p><p>  During his work on the Manhattan Project, frog Bethe met his match in a young and hyperactive bird whose name was Richard Feynman. Fresh out of Princeton, Feynman would become one of those chosen birds who soared over all of physics and sought to see everything in a new light. When he met Bethe Feynman was already working on a spacetime view of quantum theory which saw antiparticles as particles traveling backward in time. He was working out this theory with John Wheeler, a physicist whose birdlike abilities were so unique that he would become known for thinking in pictures and poetic visions. Bird Feynman and frog Bethe got along exceedingly well, and Bethe’s invitation to Feynman to become his colleague at Cornell University allowed Feynman to make his famous discovery of Feynman diagrams. Feynman also inspired my  own mentor, Freeman Dyson, who considered himself the quintessential frog. Throughout his long and stunningly diverse career, Dyson looked for problems in branches of physics and mathematics where elegant mathematics might make a difference. Dyson made his mark by explaining the disparate theories of Feynman, Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga to the public. He became a particularly joyous frog, jumping around in particle physics, solid-state physics, evolutionary biology, nuclear spaceship and reactor design and pure mathematics, finding gems and often leaving them for others to polish.</p><p>  在曼哈顿项目的工作中，青蛙贝特（Bethe）青蛙和一只活跃的幼鸟相遇，他的名字叫理查德·费曼（Richard Feynman）。费曼刚从普林斯顿大学毕业后，便成为那些飞跃整个物理学领域并试图以崭新的视角看待一切事物的鸟类之一。当他遇到Bethe Feynman时，他已经在研究量子理论的时空观点，即将反粒子视为粒子向后传播。他正在与物理学家约翰·惠勒（John Wheeler）一起研究这一理论，他的鸟类般的能力是如此独特，以至于他以图画和诗意的想象力而闻名。 Bird Feynman和青蛙Bethe相处得非常好，Bethe邀请Feynman成为康奈尔大学的同事使Feynman得以著名地发现Feynman图。费曼还启发了我自己的导师弗里曼·戴森（Freeman Dyson），他认为自己是典型的青蛙。在他漫长而惊人的职业生涯中，戴森一直在物理学和数学领域寻找问题，而优雅的数学可能会有所作为。戴森通过向公众解释费恩曼，朱利安·史威格和辛·伊蒂罗·托莫纳加的不同理论而声名狼藉。他成为特别高兴的青蛙，在粒子物理学，固态物理学，进化生物学，核太空飞船和反应堆设计以及纯数学领域中跳来跳去，找到了宝石，并经常将它们留给他人抛光。</p><p> How do the distributions of frogs and birds look like in late 20th century physics? The three most important branches of physics during this time have been particle physics, cosmology and condensed matter physics. Of these condensed matter physics is especially notable in having a huge practical impact on our daily life in the form of semiconductors and computers. Most condensed matter physicists like John Bardeen, William Shockley and David Thouless were highly accomplished frogs. But one big bird among them stands out –  Philip Anderson who passed away last year. Anderson soared over the world of not just condensed matter physics but also made fundamental contributions to particle physics and complexity studies. His proposal of a particle that later became known as the  Higgs boson by drawing parallels of symmetry breaking between particle physics and solid-state physics has to be one of the greatest birdlike feats in physics of the recent past.</p><p> 在20世纪后期的物理学中，青蛙和鸟类的分布如何？在这段时间里，物理学的三个最重要的分支是粒子物理学，宇宙学和凝聚态物理学。在这些凝聚态物理中，以半导体和计算机的形式对我们的日常生活产生巨大的实际影响尤其引人注目。约翰·巴丁（John Bardeen），威廉·肖克利（William Shockley）和戴维·托勒斯（David Thouless）等大多数凝聚态物理学家都是成就卓著的青蛙。但是其中一只大鸟引人注目–去年去世的菲利普·安德森（Philip Anderson）。安德森（Anderson）不仅在凝聚态物理学领域飞速发展，而且对粒子物理学和复杂性研究做出了重要贡献。他提出的一种粒子，后来通过绘制粒子物理学与固态物理学之间的对称性突破而被称为希格斯玻色子，这是近代物理学中最伟大的鸟类技艺之一。</p><p>  In particle physics, the theoreticians have mostly been birds while their experimental counterparts have been frogs. Steven Weinberg, Murray Gell-Mann, Gerard ‘t Hooft and Abdus Salam have continued the grand tradition of seeking unification of particles and forces through powerful avian tools. Meanwhile, experimentalists like Leon Lederman and C. S. Wu set up decisive experiments as frogs to prove or disprove the grand theories that birds like Chen Ning Yang and Tsung Dao Lee came up with. Meanwhile cosmology benefited from its own mix of frogs and birds. Alan Guth who came up with the theory of inflation is a bird, trying to solve several problems from the early history of the university in one fell swoop. But in the late 1990s, Saul Perlmutter and other frogs discovered the startling phenomenon of the universe accelerating by studying the characteristics of supernovae, continuing the illustrious tradition of their frog forebears Leavitt, Hubble and Payne.</p><p>在粒子物理学中，理论家大多是鸟类，而实验家则是青蛙。史蒂文·温伯格，穆雷·盖尔曼，杰拉德·特霍夫特和阿卜杜斯·萨拉姆一直秉承通过强大的鸟类工具寻求粒子和力量统一的悠久传统。同时，像莱昂·莱德曼（Leon Lederman）和C. S. Wu这样的实验学家通过青蛙来进行决定性的实验，以证明或反驳诸如陈宁宁和李崇道等鸟类的伟大理论。同时，宇宙学也从青蛙和鸟类的混合中受益。提出通货膨胀理论的艾伦·古斯（Alan Guth）是一只鸟，他一口气解决了大学早期历史中的几个问题。但是在1990年代后期，索尔·珀尔默特（Saul Perlmutter）和其他青蛙通过研究超新星的特征，发现了宇宙加速的惊人现象，并延续了其青蛙前辈利维特（Leavitt），哈勃（Hubble）和佩恩（Payne）的杰出传统。</p><p> Perhaps the ultimate bird of the recent past is Edward Witten. Along with a select few other birds, Witten is trying to bring about what is perhaps the last big bird unification, that of general relativity with quantum theory. So far Witten has flown over a vast landscape of physics and mathematics, making unexpected connections between both fields that made him the only physicist to win the Fields Medal in mathematics. But the bigger connection that he and his colleagues have made, one that sees reality in multiple dimensions and pointlike strings, has yet to be verified by frogs. Perhaps it’s fitting that Witten might be the last great mystic in the tradition of Paul Dirac, throwing a gauntlet down. We can only hope that there will be enough brave and competent frogs playing down in the mud who catch the gauntlet and run with it. If the history of physics with its creative interplay between frogs and birds is any guide, there is much cause for optimism that this will be true.</p><p> 爱德华·维滕（Edward Witten）也许是最近的终极鸟类。维滕（Witten）与其他少数鸟类一起，试图实现也许是最后一个大鸟类的统一，即与量子理论的广义相对论的统一。到目前为止，维滕已经飞过了广阔的物理学和数学领域，在这两个领域之间建立了出乎意料的联系，这使他成为唯一获得数学领域奖章的物理学家。但是他和他的同事之间建立的更大的联系，即从多个维度和点状字符串中看到现实的事物，还没有得到青蛙的证实。维滕可能是保罗·狄拉克（Paul Dirac）的传统中最后一位伟大的神秘主义者，摔倒了一根手套，这很合适。我们只能希望会有足够多的勇敢而有能力的青蛙在泥泞中嬉戏，抓住铁手套并与之搏斗。如果说物理学史及其与青蛙和鸟类之间相互作用的指导，那么有很多乐观的理由认为这将是正确的。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2020/11/birds-and-frogs-in-physics.html">https://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2020/11/birds-and-frogs-in-physics.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/青蛙/">#青蛙</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/frogs/">#frogs</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
