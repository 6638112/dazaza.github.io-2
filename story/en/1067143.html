Moving parts seize-up, circuit boards fail, cables wear out. If a user needs a replacement connector, chip, ribbon, gear, shell—or any of the thousands of other parts that, in time, can break, melt, discolor, delaminate, or explode—they’re usually out of luck, unless they have a spare system to scavenge.</p><p>每个旧的视频游戏机最终都会死亡。移动部件抓握，电路板失效，电缆磨损。如果用户需要更换连接器，芯片，带，齿轮，外壳或任何其他零件，那么可以打破，融化，褪色，分层或爆炸 - 它们通常不合适，除非他们有一个备用系统来清除。</p><p>  But there is an exception to this depressing law of nature. In San Jose, on a side street next to a highway off-ramp, inside an unmarked warehouse building, is part of the world’s largest remaining collection of factory-original replacement Atari parts — a veritable fountain of youth for aging equipment from the dawn of the home computing and video gaming era. This is the home of Best Electronics, a mail-order business that has been selling Atari goods continuously for almost four decades.</p><p>  但这种令人沮丧的自然法则有一个例外。在圣何塞旁边的街道旁边的街道上，在一个无标记的仓库建筑内，是世界上最大的工厂原装替代atari零件的一部分 - 从黎明的老化设备是一个名副其实的青年喷泉家庭计算和视频游戏时代。这是最佳电子产品的家园，这是一家邮购近四十年销售Atari商品的邮购业务。</p><p>  But if you&#39;d like to share in Best’s bounty, as many die-hard Atari fans desperately do, there&#39;s a very important piece of advice you need to keep in mind: whatever you do, don&#39;t piss off Bradley.</p><p>  但是，如果你喜欢分享最好的赏金，那么尽可能多的愚蠢的亚得法常好地做，那里有很重要的建议你需要牢记：无论你做什么，都是，不要＆＃39; t撒尿，布拉德利。</p><p>  Almost everyone who spends enough time loving, collecting, and using Atari products eventually finds their way to the Best Electronics website. And many of them quickly develop strong feelings about Bradley Koda, Best&#39;s proprietor, who, by outlasting most of his competition, has become a sort of one-man Atari-parts powerhouse.</p><p>  几乎每个人都花费足够的时间爱，收集和使用Atari产品最终找到了他们前往最好的电子网站的方式。他们中的许多人迅速培养了对布拉德利柯达的强烈感情，最佳的所有者，他们的所有者在胜过他的大部分比赛中，已成为一种独立的Atari-Parts Powerhouse。</p><p>  His stock spans all Atari eras. Would you like to buy  only the buttons and faceplate circuitry for an Atari Lynx? Just the keyboard for an Atari 800? Maybe you&#39;d like to replace an individual faulty chip on the motherboard of an Atari 7800? Or perhaps you’d like a brand-new mouse for an Atari ST? Best has all these things and much more.</p><p>  他的股票跨越Atari Eras。您想只购买Atari Lynx的按钮和面板电路吗？只是atari 800的键盘？也许你和＃39; D喜欢在Atari 7800的主板上取代个人有缺陷的芯片？或者也许你想要一个atari st的全新鼠标？最好的是所有这些东西还有更多。</p><p>  And the crucial thing, from a buyer&#39;s perspective, is that these are not salvaged parts. They&#39;re unused originals, for the most part acquired directly from Atari&#39;s warehouses and preserved, for decades, in Koda&#39;s sole custody. He has simply never run out.</p><p>  和来自买方的角度来看，这是这些不是拯救零件。他们＆＃39;重新使用的原件，直接从Atari＆＃39; s仓库和经保留的大多数人在koda＆＃39; s唯一的监护下获得。他根本从未用完了。</p><p>  A single order from Best can transform a malfunctioning, beat-up Atari system into a thing of beauty — a portal to a time when 64K was all the RAM a person could ever want.</p><p>  从最好的单个订单可以转换出故障，殴打Atari系统进入美丽的东西 - 一个人在64k所有的公羊都可以想要的时候。 </p><p>  No other seller on the planet has managed to maintain as extensive an inventory of brand-new Atari replacement parts and peripherals in the 25 years since Atari exited the hardware business. And this inventory has become intensely desirable to retro-tech devotees over the past two decades, as trade in ancient gaming and computing gear has evolved into a passion-driven collector’s market.</p><p>由于atari退出了硬件业务的25年来，该星球上没有其他卖方的卖方在25年内，在建议的25年中，维持全面的全新Atari替换部件和外围设备。在过去二十年中，此库存变得强烈可取的复古技术投入，因为古代游戏和计算齿轮的贸易发展成为一个激情驱动的收集者的市场。</p><p>  Most of Koda&#39;s customers adore him. He&#39;s a skilled service technician with an encyclopedic knowledge of Atari systems. He helps customers put the joy back in their joysticks with fresh replacement circuit boards. He has been known to diagnose complex Atari ailments over the phone. He even occasionally produces his own fresh runs of crucial replacement parts when his vintage stock runs dry—most recently a brand-new AC adaptor for the Atari 2600, to replace his customers’ malfunctioning 40-year-old power bricks.</p><p>  大多数柯达＆＃39;客户崇拜他。他＆＃39;熟练的服务技术人员，具有常象的Atari系统知识。他帮助客户用新鲜的替代电路板将快乐送回他们的操纵杆。他曾众所周知，通过电话诊断复杂的Atari疾病。他偶尔偶尔会在他的复古股票运行干燥 - 最近是Atari 2600的全新AC适配器时，他偶尔会产生自己的新鲜的关键零件零件，以取代他的顾客的40岁的电源砖。</p><p>  But even those who love buying from Koda admit that they experience a slight tingling of animal fear every time they order from Best Electronics.</p><p>  但即使是那些喜欢从柯达购买的人承认他们每次从最佳电子产品订购时都会略微刺痛动物恐惧。</p><p>  “If I don’t hear back from him in three or four days, I get nervous trying to reach out again,” said Steve Maks, an Atari Lynx collector from the Chicago area who has placed orders with Best occasionally over the past 20 years. “It’s like, am I going to get on the ban list? Will I not be able to buy for six months? He’s the only source for some of these parts.”</p><p>  “如果我在三到四天内没有从他那里回复，我会感到紧张地试图再次伸出援手，”芝加哥地区的Atari Lynx收藏家Steve Maks表示，在过去的20年里，偶尔会有最好的偶尔下订单。 “就像，我要去禁令吗？我无法购买六个月吗？他是其中一些零件的唯一来源。“</p><p>  “If you call him too many times in a month, he gets annoyed with you,” said Xavier Ulyanovich, an Atari enthusiast from Oklahoma and a longtime Best customer. “If you try to order too many things, he gets annoyed with you. It just comes down to having to adapt to the way he does business. Once you’re on his shitlist, it’s kinda hard to get off.”</p><p>  “如果你在一个月内叫他太多次，他会对你感到恼火，”来自俄克拉荷马州的Atari爱好者和长期最好的客户，Xavier Ulyanovich说。 “如果你试图订购太多东西，他会对你感到恼火。它只是不得不适应他做生意的方式。一旦你在他的掠夺者身上，它就很难下车。“</p><p>  Among Atari fans, Best is almost as famous for ignoring and blacklisting badly behaved customers as it is for selling Atari parts. A first attempt to buy from Best Electronics is a sink-or-swim proposition: learn the rules, or accept your fate.</p><p>  在Atari粉丝中，最好的几乎与忽视和黑名单的令人着名的表现出名，因为它是为了销售Atari零件。首次从最佳电子产品购买的尝试是一个汇总或游泳主张：学习规则，或接受你的命运。</p><p>  Every purchase from Best Electronics requires personal interaction with Koda. Although he’s fond of using the editorial “we,” he is a one-man operation, and he doesn’t believe in automation. &#34;We prefer to talk, Via E-Mail, Phone or E-FAX to our Atari customers, and make sure you getting the Right Atari Replacement Parts / Items the first time,” he explains on the Best website, in his inimitable prose style.</p><p>  最佳电子设备的每次购买都需要与柯达的个人互动。虽然他喜欢使用编辑“我们”，但他是一个人的操作，他不相信自动化。 ＆＃34;我们更愿意通过电子邮件，电话或电子传真对我们的Atari客户进行谈话，并确保第一次获得右侧的Atari替换部件/项目，“他在最好的网站上解释了他的无与伦比的散文风格。 </p><p>  Koda is a monopolist, of a sort, but he’s no Jeff Bezos. Best Electronics has no virtual shopping cart, or any other Amazon-esque conveniences. The store’s website looks the same as it has since the early 2000s: it’s a lengthy, multicoloured text scroll, as if Jack Kerouac quit the novel-writing business (but not the benzedrine) and started typing about Atari.</p><p>柯达是一个垄断者，一个排序，但他没有杰夫·贝多斯。最佳电子设备没有虚拟购物车，或其他任何其他亚马逊的便利设施。该商店的网站与自2000年代初以来一样：这是一个冗长的，多彩多姿的文本滚动，好像杰克kerouac放弃了新颖的写作业务（但不是贝德里的）并开始键入Atari。</p><p>  Best’s catalog is only available in print. It costs $7.50 plus shipping, is the size of a small phone book, and is more than 20 years out of date. It needs to be cross-referenced with an “addendum” section on the Best website, where Koda has logged about 65 typewritten pages’ worth of piecemeal price changes and other corrections over the past two decades.</p><p>  最佳的目录仅适用于打印。它耗资7.50美元加运费，是一本小电话簿的大小，超过20多年。它需要在最好的网站上进行“附录”部分，柯达在过去二十年中记录了大约65个打字页面的零碎价格变化和其他更正。</p><p>  Anyone who can’t figure out this system risks being deemed a time-waster. In emails to customers, Koda often laments his busy schedule, and he seems to take distractions personally. He would rather lose a sale than suffer someone who hasn’t learned the rules.</p><p>  任何无法弄清楚这个系统的人都被视为被视为令人震中的风险。在给客户的电子邮件中，Koda经常推翻他繁忙的日程表，他似乎在个人身上休息。他宁愿失去销售而不是遭受尚未学习规则的人。</p><p>  At least two users of the AtariAge forums, a large online Atari fan community, have reported being blacklisted from Best for the same crime: revising their orders repeatedly. Koda processes each order by hand, and complains bitterly when made to write up more than two invoices for a single buyer. Both users claimed, in outraged AtariAge posts, that they were banned from buying for a year.</p><p>  至少有两个Atariage论坛的用户，一个大型在线Atari粉丝社区，报告称被最适合同一罪行的黑名单：反复修改他们的订单。 Koda通过手处理每个订单，并在为单个买方编写两个以上的发票时痛苦地抱怨。两个用户声称，在愤怒的Atarage Posts中，他们被禁止购买一年。</p><p>  Another common infraction is trying to buy more than a few items at a time. Koda will not handle large orders. Repeated attempts to convince him to make an exception will cause a customer&#39;s future emails to be ignored. (Recently, the limit has been three items.)</p><p>  另一个常见的违规行动试图一次购买超过几个物品。柯达不会处理大订单。反复尝试说服他制定异常将导致客户＆＃39;未来的电子邮件被忽略。 （最近，限制已有三个项目。）</p><p>  The no-large-orders rule has an important corollary: Koda will not accept PayPal orders under $50. Failure to find a happy medium quickly enough can scuttle a sale.</p><p>  No-大的订单规则有一个重要的推论：Koda将不得接受低于50美元的PayPal订单。未能发现快乐的媒体，足以释放出售。</p><p>  As Koda’s supplies of certain sought-after parts have dwindled, he has imposed lifetime one-per-customer limits on some of them. Attempts to circumvent those limits can also result in a buyer being shunned.</p><p>  随着柯达的某些追捧的部件的用品被削弱，他已经对其中一些人实施了一生的一生。试图规避这些限制也可能导致买家被避开。 </p><p>  And there are more creative ways to get banned. One AtariAge user told me that, in 2014, he had just finished paying for a purchase from Best Electronics when he noticed that Koda had refunded his money. Along with the refund came a note: &#34;see your email to Best Electronics dated 2012.”</p><p>并且有更多的创造性方式来禁止。一位Atariage用户告诉我，在2014年，当他注意到柯达退还了他的钱时，他刚刚完成了从最佳电子产品的购买。随着退款的是：＆＃34;查看您的电子邮件至2012年最佳电子设备。“</p><p>  In 2012, the user had tried to buy 20 cables at once — a rookie mistake. When Koda declined the order, the user retorted with a promise to shop elsewhere. The meaning of the refund was that Koda had decided to hold this buyer to that promise, even if it meant not making a sale.</p><p>  2012年，用户试图一次购买20个电缆 - 一个新秀的错误。当Koda拒绝订单时，用户在别处购物时的承诺反驳。退款的意义是，即使它意味着没有销售，柯达也决定将这家买方纳入该承诺。</p><p>  Kevin Lund, a retro computing enthusiast from the Bay Area, used to work near Koda&#39;s offices. “I had been in the habit of going to his office to pick up parts on my lunch hour,” Lund says. Over a period of several years, Lund was a loyal customer. According to his recollection, he placed an order with Best once every few months. One day, he made a fatal mistake.</p><p>  凯文隆德，来自海湾地区的复古计算爱好者，曾经在柯达＆＃39;办公室附近工作。 “我一直习惯于去他的办公室拿起午餐时段的零件，”伦敦说。在几年的时间里，Lund是一个忠诚的客户。根据他的回忆，他每隔几个月充满一下一次订单。有一天，他犯了一个致命的错误。</p><p>  “I had ordered a speaker for an Atari 800 computer I was restoring for a friend,” Lund says. “And I forgot to pick it up from Best at the agreed time. When I went to place my next order a couple months later, Bradley reminded me that I hadn’t picked up that speaker from him at his office and that he’d waited for me for two hours. And he said he wouldn’t sell to me again.” As in,  ever again.</p><p>  “我订购了一位Atari 800电脑的发言人，我正在为朋友恢复，”Lund说。 “而且我忘了在约定的时间从最好的时间里捡起来。当我在几个月后去放下下一个订单时，布拉德利提醒我，我没有从他的办公室那里拿起那个演讲者，并且他等了两个小时。他说他不会再向我卖给我。“就像在那一样。</p><p>  Being exiled from Best Electronics can be sort of a  Paradise Lost situation. Expelled from Koda&#39;s Eden of pristine replacement parts, buyers are forced to wander the earth&#39;s thrift stores and junkyards, scavenging circuits from husks of yellowing plastic. (Or they have their friends secretly order from Best on their behalf.)</p><p>  被排除在最佳电子器件中可能是一种丢失的情况。从柯达和＃39;伊甸园的原始替代零件中被驱逐出来，买家被迫漫步地球和＃39; S Travift商店和垃圾场，从紫薇塑料中清除扫荡电路。 （或者他们的朋友秘密地代表他们秘密订购。）</p><p>  Working one&#39;s way back into Koda&#39;s favour after exile can be difficult, or outright impossible.</p><p>  在流亡之后返回Koda＆＃39;在流亡之后恢复柯达＆＃39的途径。</p><p>  “He rarely returns any of the emails I send asking for forgiveness,” Lund says. “I had been doing it every six to eight months or so, hoping he might change his mind, but he holds a grudge pretty good. And this was over a five-dollar part.”</p><p>  “他很少返回我发送求饶的任何电子邮件，”Lund说。 “我一直在做一次六到八个月左右，希望他可能会改变主意，但他抱着一个怨恨相当不错。这是超过五美元的部分。“ </p><p>  But Atari fans keep coming back. There are, after all, no true alternatives. And, for some, there may be a certain appeal to buying computer and gaming parts from a store that still sells them the way they were sold in 1983. “It’s almost part of the charm, maybe,” says Maks, the Atari Lynx collector. “Is there some sort of nostalgia for the Best website, in the same way there’s nostalgia for  Asteroids on the Atari 2600? Maybe that’s part of it.”</p><p>但Atari粉丝一直回来。毕竟没有真正的替代品。而且，对于一些人来说，从1983年销售的商店购买电脑和游戏部件可能会有一定的吸引力。“也许几乎是魅力的一部分，也许是”阿塔里天际收集器。 “有些人为最好的网站有些怀旧，同样地有着atari 2600上的小行星怀旧的怀旧吗？也许那是其中的一部分。“</p><p>  Successful orders are richly rewarded. Days later, a box lands in the buyer’s mailbox, like a meteoroid from some alternate universe where it’s still 1995. Even before they open that box, they know it&#39;s something special. Koda wraps every package in Atari-branded shipping tape from the 1980s. It seems he has a lifetime supply of it.</p><p>  成功的订单是丰富的奖励。几天后，一个盒子在买方的邮箱里落地，就像一些来自一些替代宇宙的陨石箱，它仍然是1995年。甚至在他们打开该盒子之前，他们知道它＆＃39; s特别的东西。柯达从20世纪80年代携带Atari品牌的送货胶带中的每一个包裹。似乎他有一生的供应。</p><p>   So, how did one person corner the Atari-parts market, and why is he apparently so indifferent to selling his stuff?</p><p>   那么，一个人是如何角落的Atari部件市场，为什么他显然是易于出售他的东西？</p><p>  I sent Koda an email to request an interview, and received the expected response: I was wasting his time.</p><p>  我向柯达发送了一封电子邮件来申请面试，并收到了预期的回应：我正在浪费他的时间。</p><p>  &#34;Sorry for the delay in getting back to you Steve,&#34; he wrote. &#34;It is very simple here. Unless your E-Mail is about placing an Atari order we do not have the free time to answer it.&#34; He closed with a suggestion that I try again in six to eight months.</p><p>  ＆＃34;抱歉延迟回到你史蒂夫，＆＃34;他写了。 ＆＃34;这里非常简单。除非您的电子邮件是关于atari命令，否则我们没有空闲时间来回答它。＆＃34;他结束了一个建议，我在六到八个月内再试一次。</p><p>  Although he wouldn&#39;t talk to me, he has given two extended interviews that I&#39;m aware of: one to a German Atari enthusiast named Andreas Bertelmann in 2007 and another to ANTIC, an Atari podcast, in 2014. In those interviews, he explains the unique circumstances that led to him becoming the Standard Oil of Atari parts.</p><p>  虽然他会和我谈谈，但他已经给了两个扩展的面试，即我意识到：一个到2007年的德国Atari爱好者名为Andreas Bertelmann的德国Atari爱好者，另一个是Atari Podcast，在2014年。在那些访谈，他解释了使他成为Atari零件标准油的独特情形。</p><p>  According to Koda, he was living in the Bay Area, not far from Atari’s Sunnyvale corporate headquarters. It was the early 1980s and Silicon Valley was awash with Atari goods. Even the injection moulding plant where he worked was under contract with Atari, cranking out plastic parts around the clock. He started moonlighting as an Atari dealer.</p><p>  据柯达称，他住在湾区，不远离阿塔利的桑尼维尔公司总部。这是20世纪80年代初，硅谷被Atari商品唤醒了。即使是他工作的注塑厂，也与Atari合同，绕时钟的塑料零件。他开始月光作为Atari经销商。 </p><p>  “I saw an opening in the way Atari did business, a long time ago,” he  told ANTIC. “They had their dealers set up for replacement parts, but it wasn’t very good. We were always getting requests from people saying I need this, I need that, so I saw a little bit of a window there. As a part-time hobby I started buying stuff at dealers or whatever I could find in the Valley here. Sometimes dumpster divers would bring us pallets of stuff. That’s how it started.”</p><p>“很久以前，我看到了Atari做生意的方式，”他告诉他。 “他们的经销商设立了替代部件，但这不是很好。我们总是从人们那里得到请求，说我需要这个，我需要那个，所以我在那里看到了一点点窗口。作为兼职的爱好，我开始在经销商处购买东西或我在这里的山谷中找到任何东西。有时垃圾箱潜水员会给我们带来的东西。这就是它的开始。“</p><p>  The great video game crash happened in 1983. Almost overnight, Atari was transformed from a fast-growing, ludicrously profitable tech company into a money-losing albatross.</p><p>  伟大的视频游戏崩溃发生在1983年。几乎一夜之间，Atari从一个快速增长的荒谬的有利可图的技术公司转变为一笔亏本的信天翁。</p><p>  In 1984, Atari’s corporate parent, Warner Communications, sold Atari’s consumer products division to a company fronted by ex-Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel. Along with the company, Tramiel inherited warehouses full of excess 8-bit computers, consoles, and software Atari had produced during its brief heyday. Distributors were no longer keen on it. Retailers were no longer buying it.</p><p>  1984年，Atari的企业父母，华纳通讯，将Atari的消费品部门销售给一家由Ex-Commodore Ceo Jack Tramiel面向的公司。除了公司之外，Tramiel继承的仓库充满了超额8位计算机，控制台和atari在其简短的鼎盛时期制作。经销商不再热衷于此。零售商不再购买它。</p><p>  Tramiel and his sons spent years liquidating that stock — sometimes by tossing it into scrap heaps. Meanwhile they committed their own string of product blunders, culminating in one of Atari’s most notorious mistakes: its 64-bit home video game console, the Jaguar. In 199 6, Atari reverse merged with a hard drive manufacturer and effectively ceased to exist. (Atari&#39;s brand name and intellectual property are now owned by an unrelated company.)</p><p>  Tramiel和他的儿子花了几年清算股票 - 有时会把它扔进废料堆上。与此同时，他们致力于他们自己的产品漏洞，最终在阿塔利最臭名昭着的错误之一：它的64位家用视频游戏控制台，捷豹。 199年6月，Atari反向与硬盘制造商合并，有效地停止了存在。 （Atari＆＃39;品牌和知识产权现在由一个无关的公司拥有。）</p><p>  Best Electronics was one of a handful of small businesses that discovered they could profit off of Atari&#39;s constant overproduction and market failure by buying up unsold products and parts in very large quantities, at large discounts, directly from Atari warehouses in the Sunnyvale area. They were essentially betting that there would continue to be a small but active market for product lines that Atari had abandoned — which, of course, turned out to be a good bet.</p><p>  最佳电子产品是发现他们可以利用Atari盈利的少数小企业之一，通过在桑尼维尔直接从Atari Warehouses直接从大量的折扣，在大量的折扣上，通过桑尼维尔的大量折扣区域。他们基本上投注了Atari被遗弃的产品线将继续是一个小但活跃的市场 - 当然，这结果是一个良好的赌注。</p><p>  A pivotal moment for Koda and his contemporaries came as Atari was facing its final demise. The company&#39;s last Sunnyvale warehouse was choked with unwanted goods, and there were fewer willing buyers than ever before.</p><p>  奥塔里的柯达和他的同时代人的关键时刻是atari面临最终的消亡。公司＆＃39;最后的Sunnyvale仓库被不需要的商品窒息，比以往更少的愿意买家。</p><p>  Another Atari store that partook in some of these liquidation deals was Minnesota-based Video 61, which was (and is still) owned by a genial midwesterner named Lance Ringquist. “Regular dealers that dealt in Atari were pretty much wiped out by poor support for the machines and for the market,” Ringquist told me. “Atari would try to invite whoever they could into these warehouses to buy this stuff. They were always looking for someone to unload it on, because there was so much of it.”</p><p>  另一个ATARI商店在其中一些清算交易中是基于明尼苏达州的视频61，这是由名为Lance Ringquist的Genial Midwesterner拥有的（并且仍然）。 “在atari处理的经销商几乎被对机器和市场的不良支持醒来，”Ringquist告诉我。 “Atari会试图邀请他们可以进入这些仓库购买此东西的人。他们一直在寻找卸载的人，因为它有很多。“ </p><p>  “By the last warehouse, there was hardly anybody interested at all. Atari was pretty much dead,” Ringquist said.</p><p>“由最后一个仓库，几乎没有人对所有人感兴趣。阿塔利几乎已经死了，“Ringquist说。</p><p>  But Best was still interested. In the Bertelmann interview, Koda claims to have purchased over 8,000 pallets of items from Atari’s warehouses over the course of his career. And it appears that a lot of that purchasing happened towards the end of Atari’s run.</p><p>  但最好的仍然感兴趣。在Bertelmann采访中，Koda声称从Atari的仓库在职业生涯中购买了超过8,000辆物品托盘。似乎很多购买发生在Atari的奔跑结束时发生了。</p><p>  Prior to Atari’s collapse in 1996, Koda’s catalog was 46 pages long. After Atari folded, he released a new version, with 228 pages.</p><p>  在Atari于1996年的崩溃之前，柯达的目录是46页。 Atari折叠后，他发布了一个新版本，有228页。</p><p>  But none of this explains the endless rules and stipulations, the blacklisting, or the website. Ringquist’s operation is similarly bare-bones, so I’ll let him speak for old-school Atari dealers everywhere: “There are boxes in my warehouse that I have not opened yet, from the late 1980s,” he told me. “I don’t need a fancy modern site. The stuff sells itself. It sells faster than I can unpack. So, I mean, how much faster do we want to sell it? I have no spare time at all. I should be retired by now.”</p><p>  但这一定都没有解释无休止的规则和规则，黑名单或网站。 Ringquist的操作是类似的裸体骨骼，所以我会让他为旧学校的Atari经销商讲话到处：“我的仓库有盒子，我尚未开始，20世纪80年代后期，”他告诉我。 “我不需要一个花哨的现代网站。这些东西卖掉了自己。它比我打开包装的速度更快。所以，我的意思是，我们想卖掉多少速度？我根本没有业余时间。我现在应该退休。“</p><p>  In some markets, a merchant with a pattern of refusing sales and banning customers might eventually be out-competed, but Koda has no true competition. His stock is unique in the world.</p><p>  在一些市场中，一个拒绝销售和禁止客户的商人最终可能会被竞争，但柯达没有真正的竞争。他的股票在世界上是独一无二的。</p><p>  For many years, it was possible to buy new-old-stock Atari goods from a few other suppliers, but most are now out of business or greatly diminished.</p><p>  多年来，可以从其他一些供应商那里购买新的储藏商品，但现在大多数现在都没有经营或大大减少。</p><p>  San Jose Computer and American Techna-Vision are long gone. B&amp;C Computervisions, a California electronics shop that worked directly with Koda to buy large lots of Atari goods in the 1980s and 1990s, still sells a few things on eBay. But the store&#39;s owner, Bruce Carso, is semi-retired. There is some concern and speculation among Atari enthusiasts about how much longer Carso intends to stay in business, and what will become of his inventory when he finally chooses to step away.</p><p>  圣何塞电脑和美国技术愿景很长。 B＆amp; C Computonervisions，一家直接与柯达直接使用的加州电子商店在20世纪80年代和20世纪90年代购买大量的Atari商品，仍然在eBay上销售一些东西。但商店＆＃39;所有者，布鲁斯索索索，是半退役的。 Atari爱好者有一些令人担忧和猜测，关于Carso在留在商业中有多长，以及他终于选择走开时会成为他的库存。 </p><p>  Lance Ringquist&#39;s Video 61 is still open for business, and it still has a decent stock of new software for certain Atari systems. But Ringquist told me that he&#39;s recovering from a serious injury he suffered while working in his warehouse. He&#39;s not sure how long he can continue. When he retires, he plans to pass whatever remains of his stock on to his children. He&#39;s not sure what they&#39;ll do with it.</p><p>Lance Ringquist＆＃39; S视频61仍然开放业务，它仍然对某些Atari系统具有新软件的体面库存。但是Ringquist告诉我，他在仓库工作时从严重伤害中恢复了他的伤害。他不确定他可以继续多久了。当他退休时，他计划将他的股票的遗骸传递给他的孩子。他不确定他们和＃39;请问它。</p><p>  Koda himself is most likely in his mid-60s, and his stock is starting to dwindle. “I imagine he’s probably tired all the time,” Ringquist says. “It’s probably not so easy.”</p><p>  柯达本人最有可能在他60年代中期，他的股票开始陷入困境。 “我想起他可能一直累了，”Ringquist说。 “这可能不那么容易。”</p><p>  “We’ve got to conserve our strength, and do the best we can to keep serving the community as long as we can. Because when we’re gone, that’s it.”</p><p>  “我们必须保护我们的力量，尽我们所能尽力而为。因为当我们走了，就是这样。“</p><p>  When Best is gone, the world&#39;s Atari users will be without a centralized source of factory-original replacement parts for the first time ever. In a very literal sense, Koda and his inventory are all that remains of a once-great American tech empire.</p><p>  何时最坏的，世界＆＃39; atari用户的第一次将没有集中式工厂原始替换件来源。在一个非常字面的意义上，柯达和他的库存都是曾经是曾经伟大的美国科技帝国的遗骸。</p><p>  He saved it all for himself. But the important thing is: he saved it all.</p><p>  他为自己拯救了这一切。但重要的是：他救了一切。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kvkx9/dont-piss-off-bradley-the-parts-seller-keeping-atari-machines-alive">https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kvkx9/dont-piss-off-bradley-the-parts-seller-keeping-atari-machines-alive</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/保持/">#保持</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/piss/">#piss</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/atari/">#atari</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
