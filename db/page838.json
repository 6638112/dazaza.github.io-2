"note_en": "BlackRock   led the round with help from Highland Capital Partners, Madrona Venture Group, Kleiner Perkins and new investor Amity Ventures. The company reports it has now raised $351 million.\n CEO Bill Richter says the valuation is more than 2x its most recent round, a $93 million Series D in 2018. While the valuation puts his company in the unicorn club, he says that it\u2019s more important than simple bragging rights. \u201cIt puts us in the category of raising at a billion plus dollar level during a very complicated environment in the world. Actually, that\u2019s probably the more meaningful news,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\n  It typically hasn\u2019t been easy raising money during the pandemic, but Richter reports the company started getting inbound interest in March just before things started shutting down nationally. What\u2019s more, as the company\u2019s quarter closed at the end of April, they had grown almost 100% year over year, and beaten their pre-COVID revenue estimate. He says they saw that as a signal to take additional investment.\n \u201cWhen you\u2019re putting up nearly 100% year over year growth in an environment like this, I think it really draws a lot of attention in a positive way,\u201d he said. And that attention came in the form a huge round that closed this week.\n What\u2019s driving that growth is that the amount of unstructured data, which plays to the company\u2019s storage strength, is accelerating during the pandemic as companies move more of their activities online. He says that when you combine that with a shift to the public cloud,  Qumulo   is well positioned.\n Today the company has 400 customers and over 300 employees with plans to add another 100 more before year\u2019s end. As he adds those employees, he says that part of the the company\u2019s core principles includes building a diverse workforce. \u201cWe took the time as an organization to write out a detailed set of hiring practices that are designed to root out bias in the process,\u201d he said.\n One of the keys to that is looking at a broad set of candidates, not just the ones you\u2019ve known from previous jobs. \u201cThe reason for that is that when you force people to go through hiring practices. you open up the position to a broader, more diverse set of candidates and you stop the cycle of continuously creating what I call \u2018club memberships\u2019, where if you were a member of the club before you\u2019re a member in the future,\u201d he says.\n The company has been around since 2012 and spent the first couple of years conducting market research before building its first product. In 2014 it released a storage appliance, but over time it has shifted more towards hybrid solutions.", "posttime": "2020-07-16 21:01:28", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot",

Breitenstein, Albert Lee, Alice Cheng, Justin Stefano, Piera Gelardi, Philippe von Borries, Debbie Millman and Roxane Gay. Female Founders Fund led the round.\n Short for Lexicon, Lex was founded by Kell Rakowski, who had originally rose to some prominence after starting an Instagram account called Herstory that curated cool lesbian content from the 1800s to the 90s, including the Personals Ads found in the backs of lesbian erotica magazines from the 80s.\n  \u201c[The personal ads] were just so hot, and so cool,\u201d said Rakowski. \u201cThey were really witty and the women were super direct, and were able to express themselves in a really clear and inspiring way.\u201d\n Rakowski had an idea: What if the queer personal ad came back? She asked her Herstory followers if they\u2019d want to post their own personals and the premise quickly took off, with hundreds of personal ads flooding in over the two-day period each month where submissions were open.\n The popularity of the format led to yet another idea. Rakowski decided to set up a dating/social app that was focused on these text-based personal ads for women, trans, genderqueer and non-binary people.\n Lex, which launched on the App Store in November 2019, is an MVP that does just that.\n Users can set up their own profile and post personals, and can browse the feed of other personals and like the ones that pique their interest. While the personals themselves can be rather graphic, the app is not. There are currently no pictures on Lex, with the caveat that users can link out to their Instagram account if they so choose.\n Rather, users can browse through the text-based personals and like them, or message the author of the personal to start up a conversation.\n  Moreover, unlike your traditional dating apps, there is no mutuality required to start a private conversation. In other words, people don\u2019t have to be \u2018matched\u2019 to chat. Just like the personal ads of yesteryear, the author sends out a call for responses and the responses flow in.\n It\u2019s still early days for the app, but Rakowski has plans to set up the ability to post pictures to profiles (which would not be included in the feed, but would be clickable should the text intrigue you), as well as adding group chat to the app for folks that are looking to build community.\n Lex also has plans to eventually introduce a freemium subscription model to the app, giving users extended functionality for a monthly price. For now, however, the focus is on growth and building out the app.\n With the new funding, Lex is looking to hire underrepresented talent in tech for product and engineering positions. The team, comprised of five people, is currently 80 percent cis women and 20 percent cis men, with 80 percent identifying as LGBTQ. Three of the five team members are people of color.\n Lex is being aggressive about this hiring sprint,  posting its open positions on the app and on Instagram.\n \u201cI\u2019ve gotten so many incredible queer tech talent applying for positions at Lex,\u201d said Rakowski. \u201cIt\u2019s so inspiring and also emotional. People are writing the most beautiful emails about how much they like Lex. Hiring is 100 percent our main focus.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-07-16 21:01:06", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u540c\u6027\u604b,fi,\u5e7f\u544a", "title":

"note_en": "It seems the universe has an odd sense of humor. While a crown-encrusted virus has run roughshod over the world, another entirely different corona about 100 million light years from Earth has mysteriously disappeared.\n For the first time, astronomers at MIT and elsewhere have watched as a supermassive black hole\u2019s own corona, the ultrabright, billion-degree ring of high-energy particles that encircles a black hole\u2019s event horizon, was abruptly destroyed.\n The cause of this dramatic transformation is unclear, though the researchers guess that the source of the calamity may have been a star caught in the black hole\u2019s gravitational pull. Like a pebble tossed into a gearbox, the star may have ricocheted through the black hole\u2019s disk of swirling material, causing everything in the vicinity, including the corona\u2019s high-energy particles, to suddenly plummet into the black hole.\n The result, as the astronomers observed, was a precipitous and surprising drop in the black hole\u2019s brightness, by a factor of 10,000, in under just one year.\n \u201cWe expect that luminosity changes this big should vary on timescales of many thousands to millions of years,\u201d says Erin Kara, assistant professor of physics at MIT. \u201cBut in this object, we saw it change by 10,000 over a year, and it even changed by a factor of 100 in eight hours, which is just totally unheard of and really mind-boggling.\u201d\n Following the corona\u2019s disappearance, astronomers continued to watch as the black hole began to slowly pull together material from its outer edges to reform its swirling accretion disk, which in turn began to spin up high-energy X-rays close to the black hole\u2019s event horizon. In this way, in just a few months, the black hole was able to generate a new corona, almost back to its original luminosity.\n \u201cThis seems to be the first time we\u2019ve ever seen a corona first of all disappear, but then also rebuild itself, and we\u2019re watching this in real-time,\u201d Kara says. \u201cThis will be really important to understanding how a black hole\u2019s corona is heated and powered in the first place.\u201d\n Kara and her co-authors, including lead author Claudio Ricci of Universidad Diego Portales in Santiago, Chile, have published their findings today in  Astrophysical Journal Letters. Co-authors from MIT include Ron Remillard, and Dheeraj Pasham.\n  In March 2018, an unexpected burst lit up the view of ASSASN, the All-Sky Automated Survey for Super-Novae, that surveys the entire night sky for supernova activity. The survey recorded a flash from 1ES 1927+654, an active galactic nucleus, or AGN, that is a type of supermassive black hole with higher-than-normal brightness at the center of a galaxy. ASSASN observed that the object\u2019s brightness jumped to about 40 times its normal luminosity.\n \u201cThis was an AGN that we sort of knew about, but it wasn\u2019t very special,\u201d Kara says. \u201cThen they noticed that this run-of-the-mill AGN became suddenly bright, which got our attention, and we started pointing lots of other telescopes in lots of other wavelengths to look at it.\u201d\n The team used multiple telescopes to observe the black hole in the X-ray, optical, and ultraviolet wave bands. Most of these telescopes were pointed at the the black hole periodically, for example recording observations for an entire day, every six months. The team also watched the black hole daily with NASA\u2019s NICER, a much smaller X-ray telescope, that is installed aboard the International Space Station, with detectors developed and built by researchers at MIT.\n \u201cNICER is great because it\u2019s so nimble,\u201d Kara says. \u201cIt\u2019s this little washing machine bouncing around the ISS, and it can collect a ton of X-ray photons. Every day, NICER could take a quick little look at this AGN, then go off and do something else.\u201d\n With frequent observations, the researchers were able to catch the black hole as it precipitously dropped in brightness, in virtually all the wave bands they measured, and especially in the high-energy X-ray band \u2014 an observation that signaled that the black hole\u2019s corona had completely and suddenly vaporized.\n \u201cAfter ASSASN saw it go through this huge crazy outburst, we watched as the corona disappeared,\u201d Kara recalls. \u201cIt became undetectable, which we have never seen before.\u201d\n  Physicists are unsure exactly what causes a corona to form, but they believe it has something to do with the configuration of magnetic field lines that run through a black hole\u2019s accretion disk. At the outer regions of a black hole\u2019s swirling disk of material, magnetic field lines are more or less in a straightforward configuration. Closer in, and especially near the event horizon, material circles with more energy, in a way that may cause magnetic field lines to twist and break, then reconnect. This tangle of magnetic energy could spin up particles swirling close to the black hole, to the level of high-energy X-rays, forming the crown-like corona that encircles the black hole.\n Kara and her colleagues believe that if a wayward star was indeed the culprit in the corona\u2019s disappearance, it would have first been shredded apart by the black hole\u2019s gravitational pull, scattering stellar debris across the accretion disk. This may have caused the temporary flash in brightness that ASSASN captured. This \u201ctidal disruption,\u201d as astronomers call such a jolting event, would have triggered much of the material in the disk to suddenly fall into the black hole. It also might have thrown the disk\u2019s magnetic field lines out of whack in a way that it could no longer generate and support a high-energy corona.\n This last point is a potentially important one for understanding how coronas first form. Depending on the mass of a black hole, there is a certain radius within which a star will most certainly be pulled in by a black hole\u2019s gravity.\n \u201cWhat that tells us is that, if all the action is happening within that tidal disruption radius, that means the magnetic field configuration that\u2019s supporting the corona must be within that radius,\u201d Kara says. \u201cWhich means that, for any normal corona, the magnetic fields within that radius are what\u2019s responsible for creating a corona.\u201d\n The researchers calculated that if a star indeed was the cause of the black hole\u2019s missing corona, and if a corona were to form in a supermassive black hole of similar size, it would do so within a radius of about 4 light minutes \u2014 a distance that roughly translates to about 75 million kilometers from the black hole\u2019s center.\n \u201cWith the caveat that this event happened from a stellar tidal disruption, this would be some of the strictest constraints we have on where the corona must exist,\u201d Kara says.\n The corona has since reformed, lighting up in high-energy X-rays which the team was also able to observe. It\u2019s not as bright as it once was, but the researchers are continuing to monitor it, though less frequently, to see what more this system has in store.\n \u201cWe want to keep an eye on it,\u201d Kara says. \u201cIt\u2019s still in this unusual high-flux state, and maybe it\u2019ll do something crazy again, so we don\u2019t want to miss that.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-07-16 20:59:40", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u89c2\u5bdf,watch,\u9ed1\u6d1e", "title": "\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u5bb6\u89c2\u5bdf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u65e5\u5195\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91cd\u73b0", "title_en": "Astronomers watch a black hole's corona disappear, then reappear", "transed": 1, "url": "https://news.mit.edu/2020/black-hole-corona-reappear-0716", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u89c2\u5bdf", "watch", "\u9ed1\u6d1e"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "3e62332cda86c477e5d43e2bf701f66e.jpg", "infoid": 1012259, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5580\u9ea6\u9686\u9996\u90fd\u96c5\u6e29\u5f97\u9644\u8fd1\u7684Zamengoe\u9547\u63ed\u5e55\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u5f53\u5c40\u79f0\u8be5\u4e2d\u5fc3\u662f\u4e2d\u975e\u5730\u533a\u6700\u5927\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3002\u5e0c\u671b\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5c06\u5728\u56fd\u5bb6\u8fc8\u5411\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u8fdb\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\n\u8be5\u8bbe\u65bd\u7531\u5580\u9ea6\u9686\u56fd\u6709\u7535\u4fe1\u516c\u53f8Camtel\u6240\u6709\uff0c\u7531\u534e\u4e3a\u6280\u672f\u5580\u9ea6\u9686\u516c\u53f8\u5efa\u9020\uff0c\u5b58\u50a8\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e3a2000TB\u3002\nCamtel\u603b\u7ecf\u7406Yah Judith SUNDAY\u57287\u670810\u65e5\u7684\u843d\u6210\u4eea\u5f0f\u4e0a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5c06\u5e2e\u52a9\u8be5\u56fd\u7684\u653f\u5e9c\u673a\u6784\u751a\u81f3\u5546\u4e1a\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3001\u5904\u7406\u3001\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u6d77\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u5c06\u4f7f\u56fd\u5bb6\u4eca\u540e\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u4fdd\u5b58\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u3002\n\u5979\u8bf4\uff0c\u8be5\u8bbe\u65bd\u662f\u6309\u7167\u8be5\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\u5efa\u9020\u7684\uff0c\u5c06\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8be5\u56fd\u548c\u4e2d\u975e\u6b21\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7535\u4fe1\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u4e3b\u6743\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5c06\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u56fd\u5bb6\u9886\u571f\u5185\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b58\u50a8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u4ee5\u524d\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\n\u5eb7\u6cf0\u5c14\u6b63\u5728\u575a\u5b9a\u4e0d\u79fb\u5730\u52aa\u529b\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e00\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u613f\u666f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u3002\u6b63\u662f\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u5185\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u6240\u6709\u6700\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u8d85\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5efa\u8bbe\uff0c\u201cYah SUNDAND\u8bf4\u3002\n\u8fd9\u5ea7\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5efa\u7b51\u7531\u4e94\u5ea7\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5efa\u7b51\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u603b\u9762\u79ef\u4e3a3019\u5e73\u65b9\u7c73\uff0c\u5efa\u9020\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u4e3a1700\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143(\u7ea6\u5408100\u4ebfXAF)\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u5580\u9ea6\u9686\u6709\u53f2\u4ee5\u6765\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u536b\u661f\u7535\u4fe1\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5347\u7ea7\u7248\uff0c\u8be5\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7531\u5580\u9ea6\u9686\u524d\u603b\u7edf\u827e\u54c8\u8fc8\u675c\u00b7\u963f\u5e0c\u4e54\u4e8e1975\u5e74\u5efa\u9020\u3002\n\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u662f\u8be5\u56fd\u56fd\u5bb6\u5bbd\u5e26\u7f51\u7edc(NBN2)\u9879\u76ee\u4e8c\u671f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5176\u4ed6\u8bbe\u65bd\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a400\u5e73\u65b9\u7c73\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u673a\u623f\uff0c\u53ef\u5bb9\u7eb35\u4e2a\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\uff0c\u5373130\u4e2a\u673a\u8231\uff1b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e268\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u4e2d\u592e\u6307\u6325\u5ba4\uff1b\u4e00\u4e2a440\u5343\u74e6\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u80fd\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u67093\u53f0800\u5343\u4f0f\u5b89\u7684\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u30014\u53f0\u5404\u4e3a1000\u5343\u4f0f\u5b89\u7684\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u7ec4\u3001\u4e00\u4e2a40000\u5347\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u67f4\u6cb9\u7bb1\u3001\u4e00\u4e2a\u706b\u8b66\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u706d\u706b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "note_en": "A  data center has been unveiled in the town of Zamengoe near  Cameroon&#39;s capital, Yaounde, with authorities \u00a0describing the facility as the biggest in the central African region. It is hoped that the new data center will play a vital role in the country\u2019s drive towards digital transformation.\n The facility, owned by  Cameroon\u2019s state-run telecommunications company, CAMTEL, was constructed by  Huawei Technologies Cameroon and has a 2,000 terabyte storage capacity.\n The General Manager of CAMTEL, Yah Judith Sunday, said at the inaugural ceremony on 10 July that the data center will not only help government institutions and even business enterprises in the country organize, process, store and disseminate huge data, but it will also enable the country henceforth be able to preserve sensitive data more securely and at cheaper costs.\n  She said the facility, which was built in compliance with the latest standards of the sector, will boost the country\u2019s telecommunications ecosystem and that of the Central African sub-region as well as ensure the country\u2019s sovereignty as it will permit the mass storage of data within the national territory unlike has been the case before now.\n \u201cCAMTEL is working resolutely to translate this digital transformation vision into reality. It is within this framework, that fits, the construction of this ultra-modern data center which is compliant with all the latest standards in this field,\u201d Yah Sunday said.\n  The state-of-the-art structure, which comprises five different buildings spread on a total surface area of 3,019 square meters, was constructed to the tune of about $17 million (approximately XAF 10 billion). It is an upgraded version of the country\u2019s first-ever satellite telecommunications center which was built by former Cameroon President, Ahmadou Ahidjo, in 1975.\n The data center is part of the second phase of the country\u2019s National Broadband Network (NBN2) project. It has other features including; a 400 m\u00b2 server room with a capacity of 5 cubes, that is 130 bays; a central command room with eight working positions; an automated energy management system of 440 KW of undulated power with three transformers of 800 KVA, four power generator sets of 1,000 KVA each, a diesel tank of 40,000-liter capacity, a fire detection and fire extinguishing system, as well as a video surveillance system.", "posttime": "2020-07-16 19:59:11", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u63ed\u5e55,unveiled,\u56fd\u5bb6", "title":

"note_en": "I am a software developer. While not strictly tech support, you seem to like my stories. This story is about one particularly difficult client.\n A few stapled together papers landed on my desk. I looked up. It was my boss.\n Boss: Good morning,  u/geon ! Can you take a look at these requirements and give me an estimate? We might have a new project for you.\n  My boss is the best boss ever. It could be that he is just and rational, wanting to keep me employed because I\u2019m good at what I do, but I don\u2019t think so. He is also a great guy.\n The requirements were nothing special. Collect some data. Display some reports. Stuff like that. Simple. The client was happy with my estimate, so we go meet them.\n My contact at the client is a tall, large man in his sixties. I am tall myself, but he is towering above me at yet another 4 inches. His handshake is firm, bordering to abusive. When he speaks, the whole room resonates with his bass voice. He has a gravitas that forces you to take him seriously. If this was the stone age, he would be the clan leader, and no one would think of questioning it. A true Alpha male.\n  Once the room has stopped resonating, and he has given my hand back, I involuntarily compare myself to him. I am lanky with a creaky voice. I had a baby face until I turned 35, and can barely grow a beard. Good thing I base my sense of self worth on my professional abilities instead.\n We land the project, and a couple of weeks later we have another meeting. Having built most of what the initial requirements asked for, I was proud to show the prototype of the interface. The client seemed mostly happy, but had some additional features they wanted to add. This went on for a couple of weeks. Each of them in isolation wasn\u2019t a big deal, but they started to add up. We call this phenomenon \u201cfeature creep\u201d. The creep of features eventually slowed down, but not until they included a complete customer relationship management tool.\n Alpha was not happy with the rate of progress. Unfortunately I did not have much to demo, since I was working on the underlying structure rather than the user interface. I suggested I would add parts of the UI as mock-ups; non functional interfaces to make it easier to visualize the end product.\n This made Alpha happy, but he was still impatient. He suggested that he would make sketches of the screens for me to implement. This was a great idea, because having something visual makes it easier to communicate and reason about the project. It is a tool I have used a lot.\n A couple of days later, Alpha comes back. He is exited. He has drawn up sketches in Powerpoint for about 10 screens, and even added links on buttons to flip to the target sketch. This is great!\n I immediately notice inconsistencies. That is OK; it is just a sketch. The whole point is to sort that kind of issues out. So I start building the mockup ui based on the sketches, but with my own correction. In some places, the sketched are a bit nonsensical. That is OK too; not everyone is a professional user interface designer. I just adapt the sketches as needed.\n I show my progress to Alpha regularly, but he seems less satisfied each day. Eventually he makes it clear that he expects me to follow his sketches exactly. There is no room for my interpretation.\n Whoa! The sketches have suddenly become a specification. Inconsistencies and all. What is worse, Alpha has become so emotionally invested in the sketches that I have to argue for each and every change.\n I can sense that this is a delicate subject, but I feel it is my duty as a professional to try to reason with Alpha.\n Me: Hey, Alpha? The sketches are great starting points for talking, but not great UI. Perhaps let me do the actual designs? I am a professional.\n Alpha: Pffft! I have worked on successful software projects for  decades. I think I know what I\u2019m doing!\n I need a way forward, so I Talk with my boss. He is baffled as well, but suggests we try to give Alpha what he asks for, since reasoning with him isn\u2019t working. I put aside the UI I had been working on, and start over fresh.\n When I tried to deduce the underlaying data structure from the designs, things like contact info would be wildly inconsistent. Sometimes there would be multiple phone numbers or none. Same with names and email. Physical addresses would have random parts missing. OK. I let Alpha know about each issue, and built them they way he sketched them out. All of his \u201ccompleted\u201d designs were broken and half baked.\n Alpha actually seemed happier after this. But he complained about the size of the screens. He had to scroll to see all of each screen. He does not like scrolling. I prodded him about the actual issue. It turned out he had designed the user interface (in Powerpoint) to fit each screen in it\u2019s entirety on the computer at once. His computer.\n After more questioning, I found out that he has a 14 inch laptop. The end users have either 24 inch desktop monitors or smartphones.  Sigh\n Part of the problem is that Alpha has invented his own UI paradigms. \u201cScreens\u201d would have a fixed layout, with no scrolling. Web apps don\u2019t work like that. I believe his decades of experience was from terminal based mainframe systems, like the airports and banks usually have.\n Alpha wanted to use input fields to display output data. To make input/output textfields distinct, they would have differently colored borders. I explain that a separate output layout for input/output is much more compact, easier to read and actually had a hope of fitting on his laptop screen. But he was not interested.\n He did not know what a pop-up modal dialog was. You know when you save a file, and a dialog asks for a location and a file name, and you can\u2019t continue working until you click OK or Cancel? He instead insisted on creating new entries by selecting \u201cNew\u201d in a select box that would also select an existing entry for editing (or display). This is bad \u201cseparation of concerns\u201d and leads to horrible, messy code. It is also tricky when there is no existing entry, and you can\u2019t detect when the \u201cNew\u201d option is selected, because it is the only one. All of this made the development take at least 4 times as long as necessary.\n Somehow the project chugged along. After completing all mockups, it was time to add the actual functionality. Keep in mind that nothing so far worked. It was all fa\u00e7ade, like a western movie set.\n I began to explain the methodology we like, that I personally as well as most of the software industry believes in; minimum viable project. In essence, you start with something tiny and expand on it, making sure you always have something working.\n This is important, because the alternative; to plan everything out in detail and start building it all at once very rarely works, is expensive, slow and can\u2019t handle changing requirements. And requirements  always change. This kind of mismanaged projects can easily kill a company.\n Me: So as you see, we should start small, and expand the project one feature at a time, to ensure we stay on track.\n Alpha: No. Since we have little time, it is important that you complete one powerpoint screen at a time and NOT go back to it. When it is done it is DONE. I absolutely do  not want to hear that you are rewriting code that has already been completed.\n At this point I tried to explain about \u201ctechnical debt\u201d and how it affects software projects. Basically, when you write code, you make assumptions, and as you make changes to the code, the assumptions are no longer true (if they ever were), so old pieces makes less and less sense. So the pieces don\u2019t really fit together that well anymore. This needs to be fixed, and if you don\u2019t, you accumulate \u201ctechnical debt\u201d. Once this debt grows too large and you have weird looking code all over the place, and making any changes becomes very time consuming or even impossible. The fix is to constantly rewrite code so it makes more sense. This is called \u201crefactoring\u201d.\n But Alpha brushed me off, clearly not interested in excuses. My boss glanced at me with wide eyes. Once Alpha left, I asked my boss about the no-rewrite rule.\n  Boss: Yeah, what is his problem? Don\u2019t worry about that for now, just do your job the way you decide.\n This all took a great toll on my mental health, giving me a lot of stress. I got headaches from clenching my jaws, and had to take painkillers every night.\n Later, Alpha complained about my people skills. My boss, knowing this was bullshit, decided he would be our contact person, shielding me from Alpha. He also contacted the client CEO, to talk about the communication difficulties. The CEO apologized and told Boss that Alpha had had a freakout with their own people recently, but had \u201cpromised\u201d to behave. I also found out their hardware person, also managed by Alpha was on the verge of burning out.\n Luckily for my mental health, I was needed on anther project, so an older colleague took over. We spent some time together, bringing him up to speed and solving issues he ran into. During one of these sessions, we ended up talking about my frustration.\n Me: It was hard, you know.

Carl Fritjofsson of Creandum and Fergal Mullen of Highland Europe will join Meditopia\u2019s Board of Directors. Total funding prior to this round was $3.2m. This new round takes the total to $18.2m.\n  Based between Istanbul and  Berlin,   Meditopia has majored on localization for 75 global markets, in 10 languages, with a focus on long-term mental wellbeing programs. Since launching in 2017 Meditopia has grown to 14M users across 75 countries.\n Until recently, most meditation and mental health apps were built to suit the needs of English-speaking, Western culture, especially in the way these apps dealt with topics such as gender.\n  In a statement, Murat said: \u201cMental wellness is something everyone should be able to achieve, regardless of their country of origin, native language, socio-economic status, ethnicity, or religion. We first focused our efforts on our home country Turkey before expanding worldwide so whether you are Latino, Japanese, Russian, North American, or Arab, you can find support and coaching in our global community.\u201d\n Carl Fritjofsson,   Partner at Creandum commented: \u201cWe\u2019ve followed Meditopia for the past two years and have been incredibly impressed by how they\u2019ve been able to capture this opportunity across the world, all while being one of the most capital-efficient run companies around.\u201d\n Fergal Mullen, Founding Partner at  Highland Europe   said: \u201cFor too long, the technology available was created for English-speaking groups alone. Meditopia provides the alternative; a solution that helps its members get to the heart of what they need in a way that suits them.

Our treatment places particular emphasis on the intimate connections that have been discovered between a variety of fundamental &#34;pseudorandom objects&#34; that at first seem very different in nature: expander graphs, randomness extractors, list-decodable error-correcting codes, samplers, and pseudorandom generators.

The new funds valued Vedantu at $600 million, up from $275 million in February this year when the startup closed its extended Series C round. Vedantu has raised about $200 million to date.\n  Vedantu\u00a0offers live and interactive courses for students in grades 6 though 12 \u2014 and in recent months it has expanded its catalog to serve students in grade one to five as well, said\u00a0Vamsi Krishna, co-founder and CEO of the startup, in an interview with TechCrunch.\n Students who have enrolled for the interactive sessions are required to answer questions every few minutes by tapping on their smartphone screen or on the desktop. They also can raise their doubts at the end of the session.\u00a0Some of these sessions are free for students, but a selection of it requires a subscription, said Krishna.\n Vedantu today serves 25 million students each month. The startup has amassed an additional 2 million students in recent months as schools closed across the nation after New Delhi enforced a lockdown.\n Krishna said Vedantu is adding more than 20,000 paying subscribers each month to the platform. More than one million students attend live classes on the platform each month, he said.\n \u201cOnline learning adoption in India is at an all-time high setting a new benchmark for the rest of the world. As we continue to focus on driving high-growth ventures, our investment in Vedantu marks our entry into the Indian EdTech market. This move underlines our strategy to partner with companies that are strategically positioned for high growth &amp; scale. We are excited to partner Vedantu in their next stage of growth,\u201d said Rahul Kishore, Managing Director at Coatue, in a statement.", "posttime": "2020-07-16 19:17:48", "source_domain":

"note_en": "Earlier this month, Western Digital announced retail availability of its Gold 16TB and 18TB CMR  drives, as well as an upcoming 20TB Ultrastar SMR drive.\u00a0These nine-platter disks are the largest individual hard drives widely available today.\n Earlier this year, rival drive vendor Seagate  promised\u00a0to deliver 18TB and 20TB drives in 2020, but they have not yet materialized in retail channels. Seagate&#39;s largest drives, like Western Digital&#39;s, needed a new technology to overcome the Magnetic Recording Trilemma\u2014but Western Digital&#39;s EAMR is considerably less-exotic than the HAMR (Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording) used by Seagate. That more conservative approach likely helped Western Digital beat its rival to market.\n  The maximum usable data density on a magnetic recording device is limited by three competing factors. Magnetic coercivity\u2014the strength of magnetic field required to demagnetize a domain\u2014must be high enough to prevent the separately recorded grains from influencing one another and corrupting data. The field strength of the write head must be high enough to overcome the coercivity of the medium. Finally, the size of the field generated by the write head must be small enough so as not to overwrite adjacent areas.\n In order to increase the amount of data stored in a single platter of a fixed size, you must use narrower fields\u2014but this negatively influences the potential field strength, which in turn means that the smaller, weaker field is unable to overcome media that is sufficiently resistant to &#34;crosstalk&#34; between separately recorded values.\n There are two basic approaches to overcoming the Magnetic Recording Trilemma as presented\u2014you can devise a new\u00a0pattern of recording that works around those limitations, or you can employ some new technology that significantly changes the relationships between the three competing factors above.\n   Shingled Magnetic Recording is a technique which takes advantage of the fact that we can reliably read data in narrower tracks than we can write it. SMR disks divide their media into separate zones, in which writes are laid down in overlapping &#34;shingled&#34; tracks.\n While SMR techniques do increase areal density (currently, by roughly 10-15 percent) they come with significant performance and flexibility limitations. Since the write track is wider than the read track, an SMR disk cannot modify an individual sector within a zone\u2014doing so would wipe out other sectors adjacent to the one being modified. In order to overcome this limitation, SMR disks are divided into zones, typically 256MiB in size.\n There is enough linear distance between each zone and its neighbor to allow rewriting the zone as a whole upon demand\u2014but the zone must be rewritten in its entirety. This in turn means that a single 4KiB sector rewrite may require first reading and then rewriting an entire 256MiB zone\u2014a worst-case amplification penalty of 13,107,200 percent.\n We discussed Western Digital&#39;s use of SMR at some length with\u00a0Phil Bullinger, VP and GM of Western Digital&#39;s\u00a0Data Center Business. Currently, there are no &#34;hybrid&#34; SMR drives\u2014they&#39;re either host-managed or drive-managed, not both.\n Consumer-targeted SMR disks\u2014like the much-maligned Western Digital  Red and small desktop  drives from Seagate, Toshiba, and Western Digital\u2014are drive-managed SMR. The firmware and processor on the drive itself manage aligning writes to zones, garbage collection as zones are rewritten, and everything else necessary to at least attempt to make the SMR drive perform to the levels expected to accommodate a typical consumer workload.\n Enterprise-targeted SMR disks, by contrast, are host-managed. In a host-managed SMR disk, caching, zone management, and everything else necessary to optimize write patterns to the drive occurs on the host computer itself. This allows not only for larger caches but also for data optimizations further down the stack at the application level itself. If an application can deliberately produce data in 256MiB chunks rather than smaller, more random operations, its performance will skyrocket on drives with matching 256MiB zones.\n Western Digital&#39;s new 16TB and 18TB Gold drives do not use SMR technology. The larger 20TB Ultrastar sibling does, and must\u2014host-managed SMR is what allows it to eke an additional 11 percent data density out of otherwise almost entirely similar hardware.\n     The other way to potentially increase storage density is to alter the parameters of the Magnetic Recording Trilemma by introducing substantially different recording technology.\n Seagate&#39;s HAMR (Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording) is one example of such new recording technology. HAMR uses a small laser to precisely heat the recording medium, temporarily reducing coercivity in an extremely small, well-defined area. The temporarily reduced coercivity allows smaller (and necessarily weaker) fields to alter that area without influencing surrounding, separately recorded areas.\n In earlier research, Western Digital favored a similar technology\u2014MAMR, or Microwave Assisted Magnetic Recording. MAMR uses a microwave emitter to excite a tiny area of the drive in order to similarly reduce coercivity to the targeted area for just long enough to perform the write operation.\n    Although Western Digital is continuing its research into MAMR technology, the tech used in this month&#39;s new drives\u2014EAMR, or Energy Assisted Magnetic Recording\u2014is considerably less exotic. Rather than alter the magnetic properties of the medium with microwave or laser emissions, EAMR simply stabilizes the write field more rapidly and accurately, by using a bias current on the main pole of the write head as well as the current on the voice coils.\n As you can see in Western Digital&#39;s graph in the gallery above\u2014which Bullinger assured us was an actual graph using real data, not a theoretical mock-up\u2014biasing the main pole results in much more coherent, predictable field curves from the head as a whole. This allows writes to significantly smaller areas than would be possible without the main pole bias.\n The new 18TB and 20TB drives also utilize three stage actuators, which Bullinger tells us is an industry first. Each stage is a separately hinged pivot point controlling the placement of the drive&#39;s heads. The first stage makes rapid, sweeping changes to head placement, while the other two\u2014milliactuator and microactuator\u2014make increasingly small, fine changes. The triple-stage design contributes to an extremely dense drive&#39;s ability to both rapidly and accurately position its heads as necessary.\n Finally, like all very large modern drives, Western Digital&#39;s EAMR disks are fully sealed, with an internal helium atmosphere. The lower density of helium at a given pressure creates a far less turbulent environment for the heads and platters, allowing for more rapid and accurate tracking.\n  At the moment, you won&#39;t find SMR information on any of the Gold drives&#39; datasheets. We called a Western Digital representative for clarification\u2014since no drives in the Gold line use SMR, the company thought that SMR notifications weren&#39;t necessary. (We strongly recommended including this information in the drives&#39; datasheets in the future.)\n Western Digital&#39;s representatives tell us that the company&#39;s Gold drives can best be considered as a subset of its Ultrastar DC line\u2014all Gold disks have technically identical Ultrastar equivalents, but not all Ultrastar disks have Gold equivalents. The Gold product line are all enterprise drives\u2014but the entire line-up is all-SATA, all-CMR, all the time. Drives in the broader Ultrastar line-up may offer SATA or SAS interfaces, and either conventional or shingled magnetic recording.\n The new, non-SMR 16TB and 18TB Western Digital Gold drives are generally available from Western Digital&#39;s company  store and from standard retail  channels today. Western Digital tells us that the host-managed SMR 20TB Ultrastar DC  HC650\u00a0is production sampling to select customers now and will be widely available next quarter.", "posttime": "2020-07-16

pressure placed on its services since the start of the   COVID-19 pandemic. Everything from video conferencing and remote appointments with GPs through to artificial intelligence systems designed to understand the demand for hospital beds, has been used to help keep healthcare services operating throughout the pandemic.\n    In the early days of the coronavirus crisis, NHS Digital, which is responsible for a number of key digital services for health and social care in the UK, quickly found itself under strain as people began searching for information on COVID-19. In the first week of March alone, the organisation fielded an additional 120,000 calls to its NHS 111 hotline, forcing it to quickly increase capacity and set up an online system where people could check  COVID-19 symptoms and get advice.\n Within a week, more than one million people had used the service; at its peak, NHS 111 online experienced 95 times its highest ever use, with over 818,000 accessing the service in a single day.\n     The experience was testing for NHS Digital, which had to rapidly scale up services at a pace that, while necessary, Wilkinson admits felt &#34;too fast for comfort&#34; at times. &#34;We&#39;ve really lived by the seat of our pants on some of the things we&#39;ve done in the last few months,&#34; she says.\n But Wilkinson says that how NHS Digital has responded to COVID-19 has shown that agility, even from one of the largest organisations on the planet, is still possible. &#34;The interesting thing for me has been two big things: one, we&#39;ve been able to show both the power of digital and data in serving the health and care system, and what we can do with the stuff we have at our fingertips,&#34; she says.\n   Wilkinson believes the crisis has also shown just what NHS Digital is capable of as an organisation: its ability to deliver secure products and services at great speed. &#34;That, I think, has been really confidence-building for us,&#34; she adds.\n  Deploying new tools so quickly has come with its challenges, including having to very quickly fix up the NHS&#39;s technical plumbing. This includes introducing massively improved connectivity to different parts of the healthcare system, creating tens of thousands of new NHSmail users in social care, bandwidth upgrades and new virtual smartcard authentication systems.\n &#34;The infrastructure demand has been incredibly high, in ways that I really don&#39;t think we could have predicted at the outset of this,&#34; says Wilkinson.\n The call for data has also been &#34;extraordinary&#34;, she adds. NHS Digital and NHSX have been working on a number of data initiatives throughout the pandemic aimed at capturing and making sense of COVID-19 data from across the health system, striking up partnerships with industry  partners including AWS, Google and Microsoft in the process.\n NHS Digital is now seeing an unprecedented demand from NHS organisations that want to access and connect this data, Wilkinson says: &#34;We throw up a dashboard, and by the end of the day we have hundreds of people wanting access to it. We&#39;re trying to make as much of that as open as we can.&#34;\n Perhaps unexpectedly, one of the most significant technology deployments of the pandemic has been  Microsoft Teams, which was  rolled out to every NHS organisation across England and Scotland in the days following bans on businesses and non-essential travel in the UK. The software proved instrumental in allowing NHS teams to coordinate their responses to the crisis and continue their all-important work in the face of a global health crisis.\n &#34;The Teams deployment had a huge impact on the productivity of the service,&#34; says Wilkinson. &#34;That scale of deployment in that time with that resilience was phenomenal.&#34;\n  There&#39;s no contesting the argument that technology has the potential to transform healthcare. According to  a recent study by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), greater use of digital tools within the NHS could save up to 20,000 additional lives each year, at an estimated \u00a310bn saving to the health service.\n Several attempts have been made to overhaul the NHS&#39;s IT infrastructure over the years, with limited success. Perhaps the most infamous example is the National Programme for IT (NPfIT), which ran from 2002 to 2011 and set out to create a single, integrated health record across the whole of secondary care that would allow patient data to be shared across regional boundaries.\n While it was credited for establishing a few key pieces of national infrastructure, it ultimately failed to achieve its goals after being hobbled by top-down decision-making that ignored local needs, and was eventually scrapped. Renewed attempts to join-up the UK&#39;s health and care system are underway as part of the  Local Health and Care Record Exemplar (LHCRE) programme, which aims to join-up care records across primary, secondary and social care settings across regional geographies.\n Innovation in the public health system has occurred in small pockets, though it has typically been GPs and doctors at the forefront, with hospitals and social care lagging behind. For instance, nearly all GPs now use electronic health records and computers in their day-to-day interactions with patients, while many hospitals still rely heavily on paper-based processes and other outdated formats.\n The expansion of appointment booking and remote consultation apps has also created disruption in this space, giving patients more freedom over how to interact with their doctors and their data, while at the same time offering GP practices a means of reducing in-person visits and prioritising only the most important cases.\n Progress towards &#34;digital-first&#34; primary care has skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic. A national rollout of the eConsult platform, for example \u2013 which planned to target around 1,200 GP practices by the end of June \u2013 had already been  deployed to more than 2,200 GP surgeries by April. According to  data from NHS England, 99% of GP practices are now actively using remote-consultation platforms as a safer way to talk to patients, with NHS bosses now assessing how progress in this space can be &#34;locked in&#34;.\n It isn&#39;t just GPs benefitting from the telehealth boom: on the Isle of Wight, Lighthouse Medical has been running a teledermatology clinic for the past year that allows patients with suspected skin cancer to be diagnosed more quickly.\n Using a platform called Dermicus by Swedish company Gnosco, staff can capture high-quality images of patients&#39; skin abnormality and send them to a specialist dermatology team for review. Based on the images, doctors can determine if any further action, such as a biopsy, is needed.\n Amy Poyner, clinical director at Lighthouse Medical, tells ZDNet the technology has been &#34;completely essential&#34; in allowing the clinic to continue running cancer services that might otherwise have been paused \u2013 as they have elsewhere in the country \u2013 as COVID-19 spread.\n &#34;The support that it&#39;s provided means that we are still completely within all of our targets for the cancer wait times,&#34; Poyner says.\n &#34;We haven&#39;t fallen behind at all during COVID-19, because the teledermatology service has enabled us to continue while reducing unnecessary patient contact.&#34;\n  The Dermicus Teledermatology Service had already reduced the number of patients needing in-person appointments prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. In a sense, then, nothing has changed, though Poyner says the appetite for using digital services in this time has grown noticeably.\n &#34;The main thing that has changed is that patients have been using eConsult with their GP surgeries and sending in images themselves, which in itself is a version of teledermatology,&#34; she adds.\n In some ways, the coronavirus pandemic has improved access to GP services on the island: with doctors directing patients away from their surgeries and to virtual services instead, routine waiting times have nosedived. Where patients might have had to wait up to three weeks for a physical appointment, those using eConsult are generally able to speak to a healthcare professional within 48 hours: &#34;a game-changer&#34;, according to Poyner.\n &#34;There has been a sea change in the patients themselves, because a lot of them don&#39;t want to physically see us or go to a GP, because of COVID-19 shielding. They are going out of their way to work out how they can get a photo to us,&#34; she adds.\n &#34;I think it has completely revolutionised how we&#39;ve been able to deal with COVID, and reducing face-to-face contact to anyone that is absolutely clinically necessary.&#34;\n  COVID-19 has also accelerated the introduction of virtual consultations at Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust, where nurses and ICU staff have been using specially designed smartphones coupled with telehealth software to safeguard patients and staff, as well as conserve precious personal protective equipment (PPE).\n More than 40 intensive care staff at the hospital have been using smartphones designed by Swiss company Ascom to conduct remote ward rounds. The handsets, which are designed specifically for healthcare environments and can be easily sanitised, feature Attend Anywhere&#39;s video-consultation platform and a single sign-on system from Imprivata.\n Where four doctors clad in PPE might have attended each ward round before, a single doctor will now enter the quarantine sector of the ICU and coordinate the round with other doctors watching from a meeting room, where the video is projected onto a screen. Following the success of this initiative, it&#39;s now being used across all 14 of Royal Surrey&#39;s adult in-patient wards, in its community hospitals and in other departments.\n Claire Richardson, a nurse specialist who has been using the Ascom handsets, says the mobile technology has had a huge impact on patient wellbeing during the crisis \u2013 and given back precious time that had been lost to COVID-19.\n &#34;Human contact and family contact is huge to patients&#39; recovery,&#34; she explains. &#34;When they were isolated, it was so difficult for patients and for their loved ones, so we wanted to have some way of bridging that gap.\n  &#34;I would be the first to say an actual visit is better than a virtual visit; but if an actual visit is not possible, a virtual visit is the second best thing.&#34;\n Richardson points out that even beyond coronavirus, there will always be value in technology that removes geographic or physical barriers, particularly if it&#39;s designed in a way that puts its users \u2013 namely, clinicians \u2013 at the centre.\n &#34;Nurses are not always the first to embrace new technology \u2013 but I think when even a nurse can see that something is going to make a big difference to your patients, then that&#39;s your motivation to embrace it and take it on,&#34; she says.\n &#34;I don&#39;t see this stopping at the end of COVID-19, because there will always be people in hospital who can&#39;t have a visit from their loved one, for whatever reason. I suspect we will look at other ways that we can use the technology.&#34;\n   While large parts of the health system have embraced digital with open arms, a few pockets of resistance have made overall progress slow. COVID-19 has nudged the digital dial forward, simply because there hasn&#39;t been much of an option to do otherwise.\n &#34;What&#39;s happened is awful, but it&#39;s forced us to adopt it,&#34; says Mandy Griffin, CIO at Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust.\n &#34;It&#39;s developed some confidence from people that maybe would have taken a bit longer, had they had a choice.&#34;\n Griffin points out that much of the technology that&#39;s seen widespread adoption over the past few months has been out of the necessity of limiting person-to-person contact. At Calderdale and Huddersfield, this has ranged from restricting how patients move through the hospital, to the introduction of voice-recognition technology to limit how often clinical staff have to touch keyboards and physical devices.\n Hospitals were not exempt from  the rapid shift to remote working caused by COVID-19 either. Roughly a third of the staff at Calderdale and Huddersfield were forced to work from home due to the virus, Griffin explains: a situation which, like many organisations, it never envisioned.\n Microsoft Teams has ensured staff remain connected during this time. Not only has it allowed the hospital to offer virtual visits and video consultations in some of its specialty clinics, but the software has also improved communication with Calderdale&#39;s care home workers.\n &#34;We&#39;ve been able to rapidly roll out Teams and gave them the hardware to do it to 38 care homes in Calderdale to make sure our community teams could work with the care home team \u2013 to make sure patients were OK, but also, to make sure they were OK,&#34; says Griffin.\n  While hospitals are increasingly adopting mobile working, digital communication remains a challenge for the NHS. Outdated and heavily-siloed communication has hampered the NHS for years, something not least demonstrated by the fact it still relies heavily on pagers and fax machines.\n This issue received increased focus in  the aftermath of 2016&#39;s WannaCry ransomware outbreak, with a report from the National Audit Office warning that poor communications early on left many organisations without a clear picture of how the event unfolded. The problem was compounded when staff were locked out of IT systems, leaving many to fall back on consumer services like WhatsApp to communicate.\n In many ways, the COVID-19 crisis has opened the doors to a lot of digital tools that had been around for a while and simply waiting for their time to shine. Hospify, a clinical-messaging platform that became the first to be  approved by the NHS App Library in March this year, has seen its user base quadruple as a result of being fast-tracked by NHS organisations looking to keep staff in communication with each other in difficult circumstances.\n Cardiff and Vale University Local Health Board (UHB) approved Hospify in early March, just before the UK went into full lockdown. The health organisation is one of the largest in Europe, employing more than 14,500 staff and providing health and care services to a population totalling in the region of 475,000.\n Rachel Goodwin is one of around 20 staff at Cardiff and Vale UHB&#39;s Artificial Limb &amp; Appliance Service, which provides assistive technology and communication devices as part of a community rehabilitation service and for individuals with serious disabilities. Goodwin, a senior clinical engineer and pre-reg clinical scientist within the service, has been using Hospify as a means of speeding up admin work and transferring sensitive patient data while protecting more vulnerable colleagues.\n  &#34;During this crazy time, a lot of our team are obviously shielded and they can&#39;t come in, so we&#39;ve been covering other peoples&#39; roles,&#34; Goodwin tells ZDNet. &#34;It&#39;s meant our teams have not had to come in, they&#39;ve not had to collect patient files or anything like that.&#34;\n It has also been a boon for staff who have been forced to work from home, yet don&#39;t have the necessary set-ups to do so, Goodwin says. &#34;Hospify has worked really well for us in that a lot of\u00a0our admin staff didn&#39;t have home working, or any way of accessing their emails, so it was a really quick way of getting them to have a way that we could then transfer patient-sensitive data securely, and in a way that&#39;s approved by the trust \u2013 which is a major thing for us.&#34;\n It&#39;s not just clinicians that have changed their attitude to digital health, says James Flint, CEO of Hospify \u2013 patients have, too. &#34;There&#39;s been a huge rise in the proportion of people now happy to consult with their doctor using phone, messaging or video, when even as recently as last January it felt like a fairly risky and even slightly suspect thing to do,&#34; Flint tells ZDNet.\n &#34;Because the digital tools in question are now reasonably mature whole areas of the industry have been able to switch to new ways of working relatively seamlessly, and now that this is happening very few people seem to want to go back to the old ways of working, regardless of what happens with COVID.&#34;\n Goodwin agrees. &#34;I think this whole period, of the last few months, has really forced people to get used to using technology \u2013 people who would never have touched it before have had to do it,&#34; she says.\n &#34;When you approach the idea with them of having to do a video call, you don&#39;t have that resistance that you had before and they&#39;re much more willing to do it.\n &#34;I know as a service we won&#39;t be going backwards with that, because we can use that time much more wisely.&#34;\n Hospify is by no means the only app to have seen its user base skyrocket since the beginning of March \u2013 other digital health services have seen a similar surge of interest.\n Joost Bruggeman, founder and CEO of clinical-messaging app Siilo, suggests COVID-19 has once again highlighted the need for modern messaging services that allow NHS teams to quickly and safely exchange information, using the devices they have in their pocket.\n This has become especially important during a time in which doctors, nurses and other health and care staff need to be able to share information with colleagues as quickly as possible.\n &#34;Before the COVID crisis, we had to actually explain this to IT managers in hospital trusts,&#34; Bruggeman says.\n &#34;In a normal situation, you have to arm twist or educate a little bit more to make sure everyone is on the same page \u2013 the classic enterprise sales motion you have to go through. All of a sudden, that is gone, because everybody is looking at the same [problem]&#34;.\n For Bruggeman, COVID-19 has brought what he calls &#34;the WhatsApp problem in healthcare&#34; back to center-stage. Except this time, there is &#34;a clear vision on how to move forward&#34;.\n  &#34;Instant, asynchronous communications tools, such as a messenger application, suddenly makes clear sense to everybody. There&#39;s no way back after this, because everybody understands that that&#39;s the new normal.&#34;\n   Digital innovation has never moved at great pace within the NHS \u2013 a problem faced by practically all public-sector organisations. Aside from the huge considerations for information governance and data privacy, the complexity of the UK health system, both technically and bureaucratically, makes rapid change difficult.\n NHSX&#39;s troubled COVID-19 contact-tracing app is a perfect example of this. The delays that have plagued the app  are well documented, ranging from vague notions of when it might be launched, to an array of privacy concerns and technical complications that eventually culminated in  a complete U-turn by NHSX, when it announced that it would ditch the centralised approach it had staunchly defended for so long in favour of the model  proposed by Apple and Google. At the time of writing, we still don&#39;t know when it&#39;s coming.\n  Even NHS Digital has felt knock-on effects from the confusion surrounding the app. Wilkinson tells ZDNet that users seeking out NHSX&#39;s contact-tracing app have mistakenly been downloading the NHS App instead \u2013 a service designed by NHS Digital that is completely separate from that developed by NHSX and allows patients to access primary care services though their smartphone.\u00a0 &#34;We had quite a lot of people being really confused by that,&#34; says Wilkinson.\n &#34;To some extent I think this is our fault because we gave our products really simple names \u2013 NHS.UK, the NHS App \u2013 it&#39;s been easy for those names to be used different\n......", "posttime": "2020-07-16 18:54:48", "source_domain":

"note_en": "Animal farming and fossil fuels have driven global emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane to the highest level on record, putting the world on track for dangerously increased heat levels of 3C to 4C.\n Since 2000 discharges of the odourless, colourless gas have risen by more than 50m tonnes a year, equivalent to 350m cars or double the total emissions of Germany or France, according to the latest Methane Budget study by a global team of scientists.\n The findings, published in Earth System Science Data and  Environmental Research Letters, show that more than half of the methane in the atmosphere now comes from human sources. Of this share, ranching, agriculture and landfills account for about two-thirds, while the fossil fuel industry, composed of oil, gas and coal, makes up the rest.\n Methane is second only to carbon dioxide in its contribution to global heating; the gas is released in much smaller quantities but is 28 times more powerful at trapping warmth over a 100-year span.\n In 2017, the most recent year for which data is available, the planet\u2019s atmosphere absorbed almost 600m tonnes of methane, up 9% from the early years of the century when concentrations were relatively stable.\n Rob Jackson, a professor at the Stanford University  School of Earth, Energy &amp; Environmental Sciences, in California, chairs the Global Carbon Project and led one of the papers. He said human activities since the industrial revolution had increased the amount of methane in the atmosphere by 2.6 times, compared with 1.7 times for carbon dioxide.\n As methane is more potent then CO 2 and shorter-lived in its climate effects, it should be a focus of efforts to cut emissions, said Jackson.\n \u201cCO 2 is still the beast to slay but warming from methane is the next most important. Acting aggressively on methane can buy us time to address CO 2 and shave half a degree off the peak temperature,\u201d he said. \u201cI am optimistic about opportunities to find methane super-emitters, using drones and satellites. But it is harder to cut emissions from a billion burping cows and a billion sheep, where dietary choices and manure management matter.\u201d\n The change is markedly different by sector and location. Agricultural methane emissions rose nearly 11% in the study period, while those from fossil fuels rose 15%.\n Regionally, the biggest increases \u2013 of 10m to 15m tonnes a year \u2013 were in Asia, Africa and Oceania, largely due to farming. In the US most of the 4.5m-tonne rise over the past decade has been attributed to fracking and others forms of oil and gas drilling, piping and consumption.\n Europe was the only continent to register a decline thanks to strong measures to reduce emissions from manure and industry. The Arctic also saw little change, suggesting fears of methane being released from melting permafrost had not been realised up to 2017.\n The authors said there could not be a worldwide stabilisation in methane emissions unless governments took rapid action.\n Marielle Saunois, of the Universit\u00e9 de Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, in France, who was lead author of the paper in  Earth System Science Data, said solutions existed that did not necessarily require reduction in consumption. \u201cPolicies and better management have  reduced emissions from landfills, manure and other sources here in Europe. People are also eating less beef and more poultry and fish,\u201d she said.\n The coronavirus lockdowns are thought to have had less of an impact on methane emissions than on CO 2 and nitrogen dioxide because agriculture has not been as affected by the measures as transport and industry.", "posttime": "2020-07-16 18:54:14", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5347\u81f3,rises,\u7532\u70f7", "title": "\u7532\u70f7\u5347\u81f3\u6709\u8bb0\u5f55\u4ee5\u6765\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73", "title_en": "Methane rises to highest level on record", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/14/livestock-farming-and-fossil-fuels-could-drive-4c-global-heat-rise", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5347\u81f3", "rises", "\u7532\u70f7"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1012249, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4e0b\u8f7dPDF\u6458\u8981\uff1a\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6613\u53d7\u654c\u610f\u793a\u4f8b\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f8b\u5b50\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u6b64\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u4e3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u7b97\u5668\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u5f15\u8d77\u4e86\u5305\u62ecCT\u548cMRI\u5728\u5185\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u7684\u6781\u5927\u5174\u594b\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u8fd1\u4e5f\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u6307\u51fa\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u7c7b\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u50cf\u4ee5\u5f80\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u90a3\u6837\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u8be5\u5728\u6d4b\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4fee\u6539\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u8f85\u52a9\u7f51\u7edc\u751f\u6210\u654c\u610f\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eAmin-Max\u516c\u5f0f\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f-\u6700\u5927\u516c\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6b63\u5219\u89e3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u7531\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u7684OFILL\u6761\u4ef6\u800c\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u654c\u610f\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f-\u6700\u5927\u516c\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6b63\u5219\u89e3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u7531\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u7684OFILL-\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u800c\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u654c\u610f\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6700\u5c0f-\u6700\u5927\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u786e\u5b9e\u6536\u655b\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u89e3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5(CS)\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u6709\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9CS\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6765\u8865\u5145\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u589e\u52a0\u6270\u52a8\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u75c5\u6001\u548c\u826f\u6001\u6d4b\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u8d28\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "note_en": "Download PDF  Abstract: Deep-learning-based methods for different applications have been shownvulnerable to adversarial examples. These examples make deployment of suchmodels in safety-critical tasks questionable. Use of deep neural networks asinverse problem solvers has generated much excitement for medical imagingincluding CT and MRI, but recently a similar vulnerability has also beendemonstrated for these tasks. We show that for such inverse problem solvers,one should analyze and study the effect of adversaries in themeasurement-space, instead of the signal-space as in previous work. In thispaper, we propose to modify the training strategy of end-to-enddeep-learning-based inverse problem solvers to improve robustness. We introducean auxiliary network to generate adversarial examples, which is used in amin-max formulation to build robust image reconstruction networks.Theoretically, we show for a linear reconstruction scheme the min-maxformulation results in a singular-value(s) filter regularized solution, whichsuppresses the effect of adversarial examples occurring because ofill-conditioning in the measurement matrix. We find that a linear network usingthe proposed min-max learning scheme indeed converges to the same solution. Inaddition, for non-linear Compressed Sensing (CS) reconstruction using deepnetworks, we show significant improvement in robustness using the proposedapproach over other methods. We complement the theory by experiments for CS ontwo different datasets and evaluate the effect of increasing perturbations ontrained networks. We find the behavior for ill-conditioned and well-conditionedmeasurement matrices to be qualitatively different.", "posttime": "2020-07-16 18:31:49", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

"note_en": "In a decision that took much of the tax world by surprise, the General Court of the European Union today quashed a decision by the European Commission that Ireland had granted Apple an illegal State aid. A Commission decision had concluded that, on account of the aid, Apple owed Ireland \u20ac13bn in additional taxes.\n The court dismissed many of the initial objections made by both Ireland and Apple as to whether the Commission was acting ultra vires its powers, and whether it could rely on OECD guidance in terms of determining what the taxable profits ought to have been.\n From the Commission viewpoint, these conclusions will have come as a relief. The court confirmed the competence of the Commission to investigate tax laws and tax rulings under State aid law and to rely on the OECD arms\u2019 length standard to support that investigation.\n From the Commission viewpoint, these conclusions will have come as a relief. The court confirmed the competence of the Commission to investigate tax laws and tax rulings under State aid law and to rely on the OECD arms\u2019 length standard to support that investigation\n However, the General Court crucially held that as a matter of Irish tax law, Apple\u2019s IP belonged in Cupertino and not in Ireland, and as a result, the taxable profits of the Irish branches should have reflected the activities in those branches, and not the entire activity of the multinational group.\n Because the EU Commission had argued that the absence of staff and tangible assets outside of Ireland indicated that the IP must have been assets of the branches, they failed to consider what Irish tax may have been due had normal transfer pricing rules been followed to calculate the taxable profits of those branches excluding the IP.\n While the court expressed sympathy with the Commission that the Irish Revenue agreements with Apple lacked detail and rigour, because the Commission didn\u2019t produce evidence of the appropriate counterfactual, the procedural failings on the part of Irish Revenue were insufficient in and of themselves to evidence an aid.\n The magnitude of the procedural failings by Irish Revenue may have been highly indicative of aid; however, the burden of proof rested with the Commission, and they failed to satisfy it.\n Somewhat amusingly, the lack of documentary evidence by Irish Revenue led the General Court to assume that un-minuted meetings may have considered the matters in more detail and corrected the procedural failings in the documentary evidence. \u00a0So, the failure of Irish Revenue to provide the minutes of the meetings may have assisted Apple and Ireland in this case.\n Because the Commission failed on evidentiary grounds, it is difficult to see an appeal to the Court of Justice as such an appeal would be required to be on a point of law.\n Because the Commission failed on evidentiary grounds, it is difficult to see an appeal to the Court of Justice as such an appeal would be required to be on a point of law.\n It may be possible for the Commission to assert that the General Court was incorrect in determining that the exclusion of the IP assets from the branches was incorrect as a matter of law and, on that basis, an appeal might be possible.\n It may also be possible for the Commission to initiate new proceedings for some of the years at issue using the guidance delivered by the court, but if they accept that the IP should be excluded then it is unlikely that any new determination of aid would be anything close to \u20ac13bn.", "posttime": "2020-07-16 18:31:20", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "apple,\u82f9\u679c,\u6cd5\u9662,court,\u7231\u5c14\u5170",

"note_en": "Not many people called it, but a weird upside to the Coronavirus &#34;New Normal&#34; is that companies that are fiercely against working from home have now been forced to let their staff do it because of health laws, or staff refusal to come in and risk catching the virus.\n Many tech workers have been enjoying this perk, and possibly thinking to themselves &#34;can I work like this forever?&#34;. I believe the answer is yes, but for most, it won&#39;t be for zero effort. When the pandemic is over, old ways of thinking might creep back in.\n With a bit of thought on your part, now is the best time ever to transition to remote work, so that you can travel more, commute less, spend less on rent and spend more time with your family and mates.\n   Remote first companies such as  Gitlab, are set up so that all employees work remotely, from anywhere in the world. As such they are almost certainly never going to transition you to an office (because they don&#39;t have any!) or look down on you as one of &#34;those remote employees&#34;.\n They are also more likely to have the tools and processes set up the make remote work smooth because everyone has to do it. They probably have a smoother developer onboarding process than &#34;get Bob to come over and help you install everything&#34;, and have ironed over kinks to do with standups, meetings and agile ceremonies to adjust for the challenges of not being in the same physical room.\n  With the Coronavirus pandemic now an almost permanent fixture in our lives, I think most of us now have real remote-working experience. Use this to present yourself as remote-ready. In your CV or cover letter, you can emphasise this.\n For the interview prepare: How will you explain how you are great at remote work? What challenges have you overcome? How do you stay motivated and productive when working from home? If you are a team leader, what initiatives have you put in place to help make remote working more effective? How do you ensure that your team members are doing great work and not getting stuck?\n Show them that you can be trusted and that you communicate well and are easy to manage, and if applicable, can manage others well.\n  The current working situations would have proved that yes, you can have a team working remotely, regardless of your company size. If your company has done it they will have this first-hand experience. If not you can point to myriad other examples such as Facebook, Amazon, Slack and Twitter who have let their employees work from home unless they have to be in the office for their specific job duties.\n This is the time to negotiate what you want in terms of working from home, be it part-time WFH or full time. If you love where you work this is probably a better option than leaving. If you decide to move to another company in the future you can use point #2 with more force - marketing yourself as an experienced remote worker.\n  Open-source contributions, to strategically chosen projects, will not only show you can code but help you build relationships with people working at remote-first or heavily remote-oriented companies. It might get you a foot in the door or even bypass early interviews. You don&#39;t need to build an entire project and be a  &#34;BDFL&#34; of a major framework. Just find a good project in a programming language you are familiar with, and start fixing bugs. Be respectful of the rules, protocol and culture of that project so as not to annoy the maintainers, but make them enjoy working with you.\n  Keep your eye on the market, even if you are not actively looking.

is valid.\n    The court stressed that personal data transferred outside the bloc must be &#34;afforded the level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the EU by the GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation].&#34;\n It found that US domestic laws do not offer the same level of protection to data transferred from the bloc as required under EU law &#34;in so far as the surveillance programmes based on those provisions are not limited to what is strictly necessary&#34;.\n &#34;The Court pointed out that, in respect of certain surveillance programmes, those provisions do not indicate any limitations on the power they confer to implement those programmes, or the existence of guarantees for potentially targeted non-US persons,&#34; it added.\n It also stated that non-US data subjects have no &#34;actionable rights before the courts against the US authorities&#34;.\n   Max Schrems, the Austrian activist who brought the complaint to the ECJ, said  in a statement that he is &#34;very happy about the judgment.&#34;\n &#34;The Court clarified for a second time now that there is a clash of EU privacy law and US surveillance law. As the EU will not change its fundamental rights to please the NSA [the US National Security Agency], the only way to overcome this clash is for the US to introduce solid privacy rights for all people \u2014 including foreigners,&#34; he said.\n &#34;Surveillance reform thereby becomes crucial for the business interests of Silicon Valley. This judgment is not the cause of a limit of data transfers, but the consequences of US surveillance laws,&#34; he added.", "posttime": "2020-07-16 18:10:12", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u6b27\u76df,eu", "title": "\u6b27\u76df\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662\u56e0\u76d1\u63a7\u95ee\u9898\u5ba3\u5e03\u6b27\u76df-\u7f8e\u56fd\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u534f\u8bae\u65e0\u6548", "title_en": "EU top court invalidates EU-US data transfer agreement over surveillance concerns", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.euronews.com/2020/07/16/eu-top-court-invalidates-eu-us-data-transfer-agreement-over-surveillance-concerns", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u6b27\u76df", "eu"]}]
