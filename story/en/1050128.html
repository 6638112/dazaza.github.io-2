How does an order given to a broker like Robinhood or Schwab or ETrade become a trade? And if trading is now free, does this mean that you—the investor—are not the customer, but the product being sold? The answer (a definitive no) requires a closer look into the structure of markets and market making.</p><p> 最近的审查大多基于对潜在市场的误解以及推动该市场的力量的复杂性。授予Robinhood或Schwab或ETrade等经纪人的订单如何成为交易？如果现在可以免费交易，这是否意味着您（投资者）不是客户，而是要出售的产品？答案（一个肯定的否定）要求仔细研究市场结构和做市商。</p><p>  If you want to sell 273 shares of, say, Facebook stock, what are the chances that at that *very* second, somebody else wants to buy precisely 273 shares of Facebook stock? Probably zero—queue the market makers. A market maker doesn’t bet on the direction of the market; rather, a market maker is really a risk transfer agent – someone who helps transfer risk between buyers/sellers in the market by bridging the gap in time between when you want to sell your shares and when someone else wants to buy those shares, or vice versa.</p><p>  如果您想出售273股Facebook股票，那么在此*秒*时，有人有机会恰好购买273股Facebook股票的机会是什么？可能为零-排队做市商。做市商不押注市场的方向；相反，做市商确实是一个风险转移代理人–通过弥合您要出售股票的时间与其他人想要购买股票的时间之间的时间间隔，来帮助在市场上的买者/卖者之间转移风险的人。反之亦然。</p><p> A market maker bridges this gap by warehousing (holding) the risk – the position it just bought from you – on its balance sheet by using its own capital. As compensation for taking this risk, the market maker earns a very small spread, often less than a penny per share.</p><p> 做市商通过使用自有资金在资产负债表上存储（持有）风险（即您刚刚从您手中购买的头寸）来弥合这种差距。做市商作为承担这种风险的补偿，赚取的利差很小，通常低于每股一美分。</p><p> The spread, that is the difference between the bid price and the offer price in the market, is the implicit cost of being able to immediately trade (buy or sell) in the market. The bids and offers that market makers provide are often called liquidity. The more liquidity, typically, the narrower the bid-ask spread and the cheaper the implicit transaction costs. Without this liquidity in the market, buyers/sellers would have to wait around until they found someone willing to sell/buy   exactly  what they were buying/selling.</p><p> 价差是市场中买入价与卖出价之间的差额，是能够立即在市场上进行交易（买入或卖出）的隐含成本。做市商提供的买价和卖价通常称为流动性。通常，流动性越高，买卖价差越窄，隐性交易成本越便宜。没有市场上的这种流动性，买主/卖主将不得不等待直到发现有人愿意出售/购买确切他们所买/卖的东西。</p><p> The iBuyer Opendoor, for example, is a market maker for homes: before Opendoor, a house would sit on the market for months waiting for a willing buyer at a particular price. Opendoor bridges the time divide, gives cash to the seller, warehouses the home, and resells it when demand surfaces. Why? To profit—taking on risk, of course—but when done right, this is clearly a win-win-win for the seller, for Opendoor, and even for the buyer.</p><p> 以iBuyer Opendoor为例，它是房屋的做市商：在Opendoor上市之前，一栋房屋将在市场上坐拥数月，以特定的价格等待愿意的买家。 Opendoor弥合了时间间隔，将现金提供给卖方，存储房屋，并在需求出现时转售。为什么？赢利（当然要冒险），但是如果做得对，这显然对卖方，Opendoor甚至对买方都是双赢。</p><p> Market makers perform the same function for stocks. Let’s go back to the hypothetical 273 shares of Facebook referenced above. A market maker will buy your 273 shares instantly, hoping to find a buyer in the immediate future. Your sell order is filled immediately at a price that is at – but often better than – the best available price anywhere else in the market. There is a common misconception that market makers are front-running stock trades, effectively saying “here’s a market order I got for Facebook, I’ll buy a bunch for myself first, and then sell at an arbitrarily higher price.” Not only is this empirically false, it’s also illegal. If anything, market makers often are “backrunning”—they fill an order at a price   better than  the best market price, but then have to scramble to identify an actual buyer or seller later to manage their own risk.</p><p> 做市商对股票执行相同的功能。让我们回到上面提到的假设的273股Facebook股票中。做市商将立即购买您的273股股票，希望能在不久的将来找到买家。您的卖单立即以市场上其他任何地方的最佳价格成交，但通常要好于该价格。人们普遍误以为做市商是在进行股票交易的领先者，实际上是在说：“这是我从Facebook获得的市场订单，我会先为自己买一堆，然后再以更高的价格卖出。”这不仅在经验上是错误的，而且也是非法的。如果有的话，做市商通常会“落后”-他们以高于最佳市场价格的价格执行订单，但随后不得不争先恐后地确定实际的买主或卖主来管理自己的风险。 </p><p> So what am I missing here? How does the market maker make money if the consumer gets a better price?</p><p>那我在这里想念什么？如果消费者获得更好的价格，做市商如何赚钱？</p><p> As described above, the market maker’s business model depends on its ability to net buy and sell orders over time. Let’s pretend that about 15 minutes before you sold your 273 shares to a market maker, someone else bought 210 shares from a market maker. When the market maker bought your 273 shares, its short 210 shares position in Facebook became long 63 shares. Most of the shares you sold to the market maker simply reduced its position.</p><p> 如上所述，做市商的业务模式取决于其随着时间推移净买卖订单的能力。假设您在将273股出售给做市商之前约15分钟，其他人从做市商那里购买了210股。当做市商买入您的273股股票时，其在Facebook中的210头空头头寸变成了63头多头头寸。您卖给做市商的大多数股票只是降低了头寸。</p><p> Why would a market maker do this? Well, just as with Opendoor and homes, market makers believe they will get compensated for the risk of filling the order. Market makers primarily seek to earn the bid-ask spread. Let’s say that a lot of people want to buy Facebook at $268.37, and a lot of people want to sell Facebook at $268.47. That’s what’s called a “spread” of 10 cents. A market maker would profit here by filling “market buy” orders at $268.47 (the best   offer  on the market), and filling “market sell” orders at $268.37 (the best   bid  on the market). As long as the market maker can   roughly  process the same number of buys as sells, there is a profit to be had. But don’t try this at home, folks—there is a substantial amount of risk that the trades are imbalanced (e.g., more sells than buys), and the price moves against the marker maker before it ever finds someone with an order to help reduce its position. “Making the spread” is effectively the market maker’s compensation for taking on the risk.</p><p> 做市商为什么要这样做？好吧，就像Opendoor和房屋一样，做市商相信他们将因执行订单的风险而获得补偿。做市商主要寻求赚取买卖价差。假设许多人想以$ 268.37的价格购买Facebook，许多人想以$ 268.47的价格出售Facebook。这就是所谓的10美分的价差。做市商在这里可以通过以$ 268.47（市场上最好的报价）填写“市场买入”订单，并以$ 268.37（市场上最好的报价）填写“市场卖出”订单来获利。只要做市商能够大致处理与出售数量相同的买入交易，就会有获利。伙计们，但不要在家中尝试这种做法，因为存在很大的风险，即交易不平衡（例如，卖出多于买入），并且价格在标记者无法找到要帮助的人之前就与之抗衡。降低其位置。实际上，“扩大利差”是做市商承担风险的补偿。</p><p> When things go according to plan, market makers receive more and more orders and can often trade “inside” the published bid-ask spread—actually improving the price you receive compared to the best quoted price on any exchange. Filling your market buy order for Facebook at $268.42 instead of routing to an exchange that would fill it at $268.47 would represent a five cent price improvement over the best offer, which the market maker can sometimes do by matching against an offsetting order now or against an offsetting order later.</p><p> 当事情按计划进行时，做市商会收到越来越多的订单，并且经常可以在已发布的买卖价差内进行“交易”，与任何交易所的最佳报价相比，实际上可以提高您收到的价格。以268.42美元的价格执行您的Facebook市场买单，而不是路由至268.47美元的交易所，将比最佳报价高出5美分，做市商有时可通过与现在的抵消订单或价格相匹配来做到这一点。稍后抵消订单。</p><p> For a very volatile security with a quote that moves all over the place, spreads can be VERY large. As long as the market maker is grabbing buys and sells equally, it should earn the spread, which represents a profit. But if the price “runs away” on one side of the trade—say, the market maker gets 300 shares of buying, then 1,000 shares of buying, then more and more and more buying, it then needs to “find” those shares later at a higher price, and is taking on increasing amounts of risk. Most market makers therefore have risk models around how imbalanced they allow their positions to be.</p><p> 对于报价波动很大的非常不稳定的证券，点差可能会非常大。只要做市商平均地进行买卖，它就应该赚取价差，这代表了利润。但是，如果价格在交易的一侧“失控”，例如，做市商获得300股买入，然后获得1,000股买入，然后越来越多的买入，则随后需要“查找”这些股票价格更高，并且承担的风险也越来越大。因此，大多数做市商都具有围绕其仓位失衡的风险模型。</p><p> Retail volume tends to be tautologically “small” relative to institutional volume—if any  individual  retail investor were buying, say, &gt;1% of the shares in any given company, that wouldn’t be considered “retail.” Remember that the risk a market maker takes is if the price “runs away” with a flood of directional orders—ONLY buys, or only sells. Bids/asks on an exchange might be from giant institutional investors and market makers, whereas orders coming from retail investors are…from retail investors.</p><p> 相对于机构交易量，零售量在趋向性上趋于“小”-如果任何散户投资者购买的股票，例如任何一家特定公司中超过1％的股份，都不会被视为“零售”。请记住，做市商所承担的风险是，如果价格因大量定单而“失控”（仅买入或卖出）。交易所的出价/要价可能来自大型机构投资者和做市商，而来自散户投资者的订单则来自……散户投资者。</p><p> Part of what makes market making difficult is the need for speed. You’ve probably heard of “high frequency trading” (HFT)—the use of computer programs to transact stock orders very quickly to take advantage of short-term market movements. To compete with HFT players, market makers have to make very quick decisions when they quote prices, and ensure they don’t become stale against market movements. Thus, not only do they take on the risk of potential imbalances of buy and sell orders, but they have to do so quickly to stay in the game.</p><p> 导致做市困难的部分原因是对速度的需求。您可能已经听说过“高频交易”（HFT），即使用计算机程序快速处理库存订单以利用短期市场动向。为了与HFT参与者竞争，做市商在报价时必须做出非常迅速的决定，并确保它们不会因市场波动而过时。因此，他们不仅承担买卖订单潜在失衡的风险，而且他们必须迅速采取行动以保持竞争力。 </p><p> Depending on the balance of buy/sell orders in a given stock or on a given day, it’s common for market makers to not make any profit after accounting for all of the costs they incur to manage their risks. Given the competitive and narrow profit per trade margins at which they operate, market makers can lose significant money if they do not update their bids and offers when the market moves. In other words, this stuff is very competitive and very hard.</p><p>取决于给定股票或给定日期的买/卖订单的余额，做市商在考虑到管理风险所产生的所有成本后不赚钱是很常见的。考虑到他们经营的竞争性和狭窄的每单位利润率，做市商如果在市场变动时不更新其买价和卖价，可能会损失大量资金。换句话说，这些东西非常有竞争性，也很难。</p><p>  Most people have heard of the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, but there are dozens of other venues in total that can “trade” stocks.</p><p>  大多数人都听说过纽约证券交易所和纳斯达克，但是总共有数十个其他场所可以“交易”股票。</p><p> How does an exchange make money? There are many models, but let’s look at NYSE’s electronic exchange, ARCA. You can see a   list of fees here , ARCA employs what’s known as a “maker-taker” model, paying money for orders that add liquidity (makes the price) and charging for orders that remove liquidity (takes the price). What does this mean?</p><p> 交易所如何赚钱？有很多模型，但让我们看一下纽约证券交易所的电子交易所ARCA。您可以在此处看到费用清单，ARCA采用了“制造者接受者”模式，为增加流动性的订单付款（使价格上涨），为消除流动性的订单收取费用（使价格上涨）。这是什么意思？</p><p>  The order book—representing liquidity—is a list of all of the bids (buy orders) and asks (sell orders). If you say “Hey, I’ll buy 2,000 shares at $268.11, even though it’s below the current market bid price so I know I might not get filled, but it’s a binding offer” you are *adding* liquidity to this market. If you say “Cool, I’ll sell 55 shares at the best offer ($268.47)” then you are *taking* liquidity.</p><p>  代表流动性的订单簿是所有出价（买入订单）和要价（卖出订单）的列表。如果您说“嘿，我将以268.11美元的价格买入2,000股，即使它低于当前市场买入价，因此我知道我可能不会被填补，但这是具有约束力的要约”，您正在为该市场“增加”流动性。如果您说“很酷，我将以最优惠的价格（268.47美元）卖出55股”，那么您将*获取*流动资金。</p><p> When you take liquidity, you pay a fee. When you make liquidity, you get paid a rebate. The exchange profits because it charges more for “taking fees” than it pays for “making rebates”—say, $.0030 for taking, and $.0020 for making, meaning the exchange keeps $0.0010.  A handful of exchanges like BATS BYX, CBOE EDGA, or Nasdaq BX invert this economic structure into a “taker-maker” model and charge a fee for “making” but pay a rebate for “taking.”</p><p> 当您使用流动资金时，您需要支付一定的费用。当您进行流动性交易时，您将获得回扣。交易所获利是因为它对“收取费用”收取的费用要比对“返利”支付的费用要多，例如，收取.0030美元，收取0.0020美元，这意味着交易所保留了0.0010美元。像BATS BYX，CBOE EDGA或Nasdaq BX这样的少数交易所将这种经济结构转换为“承办商制造商”模式，对“制造”收取费用，但为“承兑”支付回扣。</p><p>  In 2005, the SEC passed the Regulation National Market System, known as RegNMS, requiring brokers to obtain “best execution” for their clients within the NBBO, National Best Bid and Offer. But remember: there are dozens of exchanges, and the broker has an obligation to get the best bid (if executing a sell) or best offer (if executing a buy), also taking into account execution speed. Market makers, however, can give the retail order “price improvement” by executing it at a price that is better than published prices and warehousing the risk to offset it against existing or future retail orders.  Schwab  publishes exactly how much price improvement their customers get ,   as does Robinhood , and it is substantial. The vast majority of trades that retail brokers execute have  better  prices than are found on any market. Retail money isn’t dumb money at all; rather, it’s “balanced” money – a good mix of buy and sell orders, and small on a per-order basis compared to institutional flows—which increases the odds that a market maker will receive offsetting orders throughout the day, thus making it economical for a market maker to provide substantial price improvement.</p><p>  2005年，SEC通过了称为RegNMS的国家监管市场体系，要求经纪人必须在NBBO，国家最佳出价和要约中为其客户获得“最佳执行”。但是请记住：有数十个交易所，经纪人有义务获得最佳出价（如果执行卖出）或最佳报价（如果执行买入），同时还要考虑执行速度。然而，做市商可以通过以比公布的价格更好的价格执行零售订单，并通过仓储风险来抵消现有或未来的零售订单，来为零售订单提供“价格改善”。 Schwab和Robinhood一样，确切地发布了客户获得的价格改进幅度，而且幅度很大。零售经纪人执行的绝大多数交易的价格都比任何市场上的价格都要好。零售钱根本不是愚蠢的钱；相反，它是“平衡的”资金-买卖订单的良好组合，与机构资金流相比，每个订单的资金很少-这增加了做市商整天将收到抵消订单的可能性，因此使其经济为做市商提供实质性的价格改善。</p><p> Critics of retail market making argue that market makers are actually withholding liquidity from exchanges—but there is no data to support that this is the case. There are many, many venues where securities trade, and exchanges are not exactly profit-spurning entities. If there were a single monopoly exchange where *all* orders were processed, it might have more “immediate” liquidity, but at what price and at what rake? (Hint: monopolies charge a lot.)</p><p> 零售做市的批评者认为，做市商实际上是在从交易所扣留流动性，但是没有数据支持这种情况。在许多场所，证券交易和交易所并非完全是牟取暴利的实体。如果只有一个垄断交易所处理“所有”订单，那么它可能具有更多的“即时”流动性，但是价格和价格如何？ （提示：垄断收费很多。） </p><p> Today, retail investors benefit from trading at better prices than are publicly available—to the tune of $3.6 billion in 2020. The fragmentation of trading venues combined with the cutthroat pricing pressure placed on market makers actually works to give consumers good pricing. It’s well understood (and many published studies,  such as  those by Prof. Robert Battalio  at Notre Dame, agree) that the retail investor could be hurt significantly if all retail orders were forced to trade on exchanges and could no longer benefit from price improvement.</p><p>如今，散户投资者受益于以比公开价格更高的价格进行交易-到2020年将达到36亿美元。交易场所的分散以及对做市商施加的苛刻的定价压力实际上为消费者提供了良好的定价。众所周知（许多公开的研究，例如巴黎圣母院的Robert Battalio教授的研究都同意），如果所有零售订单都被迫在交易所进行交易，并且不再能从价格上涨中受益，那么散户投资者可能会受到重大伤害。</p><p> One way of thinking about this is similar to wholesale when buying normal products: when you buy a car at CarMax, CarMax buys cars in   advance  of demand—  anticipating  demand, but bears the risk of cars aging or going out of trend should they remain unsold. Consumers could potentially buy cars cheaper from the private sellers, but would have to search for sellers and wait longer.  However, because of CarMax’s high-volume turnover, operational efficiency, and geographic network of distribution, it is able to provide buyers/sellers better prices than they would get at other dealerships PLUS valuable immediacy. All parties are better off.</p><p> 一种思考方式与批发普通产品时的批发方式类似：当您在CarMax购买汽车时，CarMax会在需求之前（预期需求）提前购买汽车，但如果汽车不售出，则会承担汽车老化或过时的风险。 。消费者可能会从私人卖方那里以便宜的价格购买汽车，但必须寻找卖方并等待更长的时间。但是，由于CarMax的大批量营业额，运营效率和地理分布网络，它能够为买方/卖方提供比其他经销商更优惠的价格，同时还提供了宝贵的即时性。各方都过得更好。</p><p>  The retail brokers aren’t stupid. They know that market makers are profiting on the spreads due to the balanced nature of the buy/sell orders from retail customers. Retail brokers could do the market making themselves (“internalizing” customer orders instead of sending them to market makers), or they could route every order straight to an exchange (sometimes earning maker fees directly, but also paying taker fees). So some retail brokers ask for a share of the market maker profits. Retail brokers typically route orders to a handful of market makers, allocating more to the market makers that provide the highest amount of price improvement to the retail investors.</p><p>  零售经纪人并不愚蠢。他们知道，由于散户的买/卖定单具有平衡性，做市商从价差中获利。零售经纪人可以自己做市场（“内部化”客户订单，而不是将其发送给做市商），或者他们可以将每个订单直接传递给交易所（有时直接赚取制造商费用，但也要支付接受者费用）。因此，一些零售经纪人要求分享做市商的利润。零售经纪人通常将订单发送给少数做市商，将更多的资金分配给做市商，从而为散户投资者提供最大的价格改善。</p><p> Because of the highly competitive nature of market making, retail brokers benefit from having many robust market makers fighting to earn their order flow. In addition to better economics for retail investors, this competition among market makers provides a high degree of resiliency to the market; if Citadel kicked the bucket tomorrow, the retail broker would not be impacted much, since Citadel’s trades would just get reallocated between Virtu, Wolverine, Two Sigma, Susquehanna, and others who provide the same role.</p><p> 由于做市的高度竞争性，零售经纪人可以从许多健壮的做市商为赢得订单流而受益。除了为散户投资者提供更好的经济手段外，做市商之间的竞争还为市场提供了高度的弹性。如果Citadel明天开出水桶，那么零售经纪商将不会受到太大影响，因为Citadel的交易只会在Virtu，Wolverine，Two Sigma，Susquehanna和其他提供相同角色的公司之间重新分配。</p><p> If you don’t let retail brokers charge market makers a fee for the order flow, then retail brokers would still likely route orders to market makers in order to receive the better execution they provide to retail investors, but without this revenue stream, retail brokers may need to just raise fees on retail investors, and market makers would make more money.</p><p> 如果您不让零售经纪人向做市商收取定单流的费用，那么零售经纪人仍可能将订单传递给做市商，以便获得他们提供给散户投资者的更好执行力，但是如果没有这种收入来源，零售经纪人可能只需要提高散户投资者的费用，做市商会赚更多的钱。</p><p> Without routing to an “internalizer” or “wholesaler,” retail investors will likely face bigger spreads, less liquidity, and higher fees as everything would get routed to a costly exchange or alternative trading system when market makers couldn’t provide the better prices to retail.</p><p> 如果没有做“内部人”或“批发商”的交易，散户投资者将可能面临更大的价差，更少的流动性和更高的手续费，因为当做市商无法提供更好的价格时，一切都将被路由到成本高昂的交易所或另类交易系统中。零售。</p><p> SEC Rule 605  requires that market makers publish their execution stats every month. Looking at the recent data, it shows that wholesaling saves customers money—$3.57 billion of price improvement in 2020 alone.</p><p> SEC规则605要求做市商每月发布其执行统计数据。查看最近的数据，它表明批发为客户节省了钱—仅2020年，价格下降就达到了35.7亿美元。 </p><p>  As with many areas of capital markets that are not clear at first glance, trying to “fix” something based on a misunderstanding of how it works…will make it worse. More liquidity in our public markets is a win for everyone, and the complex system that we have today provides more liquidity than at any time in history—especially retail investors. It may be imperfect, but it’s extraordinarily effective.</p><p>与乍一看尚不清楚的许多资本市场领域一样，基于对它的工作原理的误解而试图“修复”某事物……将使情况变得更糟。公开市场上更多的流动性是每个人的胜利，而我们今天拥有的复杂系统提供的流动性比历史上任何时候都高，尤其是散户投资者。它可能并不完美，但是却非常有效。</p><p>  The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.
