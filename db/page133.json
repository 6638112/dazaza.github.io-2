Google  detailed YouTube TV&#39;s  &#34;4K Plus&#34; subscription add-on, which costs an extra $20 on top of the standard $65-per-month plan, for a total of $85 per month. 4K Plus might sound like it will simply provide a resolution bump, but subscribing to the higher tier will also unlock a new offline playback feature and unlimited simultaneous streaming over home Wi-Fi. The latter feature is otherwise limited to three streams per account. The one no-extra-cost feature of today&#39;s announcement is 5.1 audio support, which is rolling out to all YouTube TV members.\n  YouTube TV is Google&#39;s US-only pay-per-month service meant to replace a cable TV subscription. For the base price of $65 a month, you get access to a bundle of major cable TV channels, like ESPN,\u00a0CNN, MTV, Cartoon Network, Discovery, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, TBS, TNT, USA, NFL Network, and more. The major US TV networks\u2014CBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox\u2014are all included. In addition to paying extra for 4K, you can also tack on other premium add-ons like cable TV movie channels such as HBO, Stars, Showtime, and Cinemax. Sports packages, including NFL Red Zone, are available as well.\u00a0Just like cable, YouTube TV is quite expensive and keeps getting more expensive. Google just  raised the price to $65 last year. Even if you pay the extra $20, it sounds like 4K content will be hard to come by. Google says that &#34;4K playback is available on select live and on-demand content from these networks: Discovery, ESPN, FOX Sports, FX, Nat Geo, NBC Sports, and Tastemade.&#34; The lack of 4K content isn&#39;t YouTube TV&#39;s fault, though. While Internet streaming services like Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube have all been on the 4K content train for some time, cable TV networks are still primarily producing content in 720p or 1080p. YouTube TV is essentially cable, and there&#39;s just not that much 4K content available.\n     Google&#39;s support page says that 4K playback will require an Internet connection that&#39;s at least 15Mbps. Most 4K-capable smart devices seem compatible, but Google calls out the 4K Apple TV and PlayStation 4 Pro as having iffy 4K support, saying these two devices are only compatible with &#34;select content&#34; and that &#34;some programs may have lower resolution.&#34; It sounds like\u00a0this is an AV1 video codec problem. AV1 is the next big video codec that devices will need to support, and it offers better image quality at lower bitrates, with no royalty fees. Google is a big booster of the codec, a stance that has led to  disputes over support on Roku devices. The Apple TV and the PS4 Pro both don&#39;t support AV1, so it sounds like this support note is just indicating that those devices won&#39;t be able to play exclusive AV1 4K content.\n  Offline playback might be the most interesting of YouTube TV&#39;s two new features. The offline feature will let you download DVR recordings if you&#39;re forking over $85 a month for YouTube TV with the 4K Plus package. The one big downside is that offline playback requires the YouTube TV\u00a0 app,\u00a0so that means it works on phones and Chromebooks but not on anything that would typically use a browser, like Windows, Mac, or Linux. To try to get users hooked on the $20 extra add-on, YouTube is offering an introductory price of $10 per month extra for the package for the first year.

The Columbus Dispatch  wrote. With a June 30 deadline looming, Ohio&#39;s House and Senate approved the budget and sent it to Gov. Mike DeWine for final approval on Monday night, the Dispatch wrote.\n  As we wrote  earlier this month, the Ohio Senate approved a version of the budget containing an  amendment that would have forced existing municipal broadband services to shut down and prevented the formation of new public networks. The proposed law was  reportedly &#34;inserted without prior public discussion,&#34; and no state senator publicly sponsored the amendment. It was approved in a party-line vote as Democrats opposed the restrictions in municipal broadband.\n The House version did not contain the amendment, and it was dropped during negotiations between the House and Senate.\n  Lawmakers apparently relented to public pressure from supporters of municipal broadband and cities and towns that operate the networks.\u00a0People and businesses from Fairlawn, where the city-run FairlawnGig network offers fiber Internet, played a significant role in the protests. FairlawnGig itself  asked users to put pressure on lawmakers, and the subscribers did so in great numbers.\n &#34;We had a real grassroots movement here in Fairlawn. We are thrilled our residents, subscribers, and businesses came together and helped us defeat this amendment,&#34; Fairlawn Service Director Ernie Staten said yesterday,  according to an article by\u00a0the Community Networks team at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR). &#34;We appreciate that the State of Ohio recognizes that municipal broadband has a place in this state and we hope to continue this great endeavor.&#34;\n Fairlawn subscribers sent more than 700 emails telling lawmakers, &#34;Don&#39;t take this (municipal broadband) away!&#34; Staten said.\n    The proposed law would have let cities and towns provide broadband service only to unserved areas and used a definition of &#34;unserved&#34; that would reportedly have made over 98 percent of the state ineligible for municipal broadband. The proposed law defined &#34;unserved areas&#34; as those without access to service with download speeds of at least 10Mbps and upload speeds of at least 1Mbps, which isn&#39;t even half as fast as the 25Mbps/3Mbps broadband threshold the Federal Communications Commission  adopted over six years ago.\n  Staten also pointed out that &#34;municipalities only enter the broadband space when forced to by the inaction of the private sector,&#34;  according to the Akron Beacon Journal.\n There are  about 30 public broadband providers in Ohio. Besides Fairlawn, examples of local governments running broadband networks include Hudson, Medina County, and Wadsworth.\u00a0&#34;We&#39;re thrilled that communities like Fairlawn and Hudson can keep serving their communities,&#34; Summit County Executive Ilene Shapiro said after learning that the budget amendment was dropped, according to the Akron Beacon Journal.\n Cleveland City Council President Kevin Kelley previously\u00a0 said the city would sue the state\u00a0if it restricted municipal broadband.\n Until a few months ago,  19 US states had laws restricting municipal broadband, passed for the benefit of private Internet providers that don&#39;t want to face competition from public networks. Washington state lawmakers have since  killed their anti-municipal broadband law, and Arkansas\u00a0 ended many of its restrictions\u00a0on municipal broadband as well.\n  Though it isn&#39;t banning public networks, at least for now, Ohio&#39;s legislature is apparently not letting municipal networks apply for a new round of funding.\n &#34;While Staten celebrated the removal of the budget amendment, he called the victory &#39;bittersweet,&#39; as municipalities and electric cooperatives in the state do not have access to the proposed $250 million broadband expansion grant program that will be established when, and if, Gov. Dewine signs the budget into law,&#34; the ILSR wrote.\n The outcome of that isn&#39;t certain yet. &#34;We have been asking for a small definition change to add municipalities and electric coops, but unless they changed the language, I believe the House version stands,&#34; Staten told the ILSR. But the biggest news is the legislature dropping the plan that would have forced networks to shut down. &#34;Being able to continue [providing service] is much more important,&#34; Staten said.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:53:23", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5171\u548c\u56fd,gop,\u5bbd\u5e26", "title": "\u4fc4\u4ea5\u4fc4\u5dde\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u5728\u62b5\u6297\u5c45\u6c11\u6297\u8bae\u540e\u7981\u6b62\u5e02\u653f\u5bbd\u5e26 ", "title_en": "Ohio GOP ends attempt to ban municipal broadband after protest from residents", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/ohio-gop-ends-attempt-to-ban-municipal-broadband-after-protest-from-residents/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5171\u548c\u56fd", "gop", "\u5bbd\u5e26"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "52fe1b1c0a3112af1c5e229c6f85d4f8.png", "infoid": 1068689, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u66f4\u65b0\uff1aPrivacyShark\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u62a5\u544a\u6b64\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u5df2\u4ece\u4e0b\u9762\u7684LinkedIn\u83b7\u53d6\u4e86\u8bed\u53e5\u3002\n \u636e\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684LinkedInBreac\u533a\u66b4\u9732\u4e86700\u7c73\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8d85\u8fc7756\u4e07\u7528\u6237\u768492\uff05\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u662f\u5728\u6697\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u51fa\u552e\uff0c\u8bb0\u5f55\u5305\u62ec\u7535\u8bdd\u53f7\u7801\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u5730\u5740\uff0c\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6570\u636e\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u5de5\u8d44\u3002\n \u83b7\u5f97\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ed1\u5ba2\u5df2\u53d1\u5e031M\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u68c0\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u65e2\u662f\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u6700\u65b0\u7684...\n  RestorePrivacy\u62a5\u544a\u79f0\uff0c\u9ed1\u5ba2\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6ee5\u7528\u5b98\u65b9LinkedIn API\u4ee5\u4e0b\u8f7d\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u6837\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u57284\u6708\u4efd\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\n 6\u670822\u65e5\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7684\u9ed1\u5ba2\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4ece7\u4ebf\u4e2aLinkedIn\u7528\u6237\u9500\u552e\u5e7f\u544a\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8bba\u575b\u7684\u7528\u6237\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u5305\u542b100\u4e07LinkedIn\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6837\u672c\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u68c0\u67e5\u4e86\u8be5\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u5305\u542b\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4fe1\u606f\uff1a\n  \u6839\u636e\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u68c0\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b83\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u90fd\u662f\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u5e76\u4e0e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7528\u6237\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u8868\u786e\u5b9e\u662f\u6700\u65b0\u7684\uff0c\u6765\u81ea2020\u52302021\u7684\u6837\u672c\u3002\n \u6211\u4eec\u76f4\u63a5\u5411\u7528\u6237\u81f4\u7535\uff0c\u8be5\u7528\u6237\u5728\u9ed1\u5ba2\u8bba\u575b\u4e0a\u53d1\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4ed6\u58f0\u79f0\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528LinkedIn API\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u4eba\u4eec\u4e0a\u4f20\u5230\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u6570\u636e\u3002 \n\u6ca1\u6709\u5305\u542b\u5bc6\u7801\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ad9\u70b9\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u8fd9\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u8eab\u4efd\u76d7\u7a83\u548c\u4ee4\u4eba\u4fe1\u670d\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u9493\u9c7c\u5c1d\u8bd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u81ea\u5df1\u7528\u4e8e\u83b7\u53d6LinkedIn\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u767b\u5f55\u51ed\u636e\u3002\n \u4f7f\u7528\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\uff0cLinkedIn\u786e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86500M\u8bb0\u5f55\u5305\u62ec\u4ece\u5176\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u58f0\u79f0\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u6e90\u3002 Privacyshark\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u6b64\u65f6\u53d1\u8868\u4e86\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u9648\u8ff0\uff1a\n \u867d\u7136\u6211\u4eec\u4ecd\u5728\u8c03\u67e5\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u62ec\u4eceLinkedIn\u522e\u4e0b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ece\u5176\u4ed6\u6765\u6e90\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0d\u662fLinkedIn\u6570\u636e\u8fdd\u7ea6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u786e\u5b9a\u6ca1\u6709\u66b4\u9732\u79c1\u4ebaLinkedIn\u6210\u5458\u6570\u636e\u3002\u6765\u81eaLinkedIn\u7684\u522e\u64e6\u6570\u636e\u662f\u8fdd\u53cd\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u6761\u6b3e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u65ad\u52aa\u529b\u786e\u4fdd\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4f1a\u5458\u9690\u79c1\u53d7\u5230\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002\n \u67d0\u4eba\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u591f\u522e\u767e\u4e07\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u4f7f\u7528API\u200b\u200b\u8fd8\u662f\u5176\u4ed6\uff0c\u8fd9\u7edd\u5bf9\u662f\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e......\n  \u60a8\u6b63\u5728\u9605\u8bfb9To5MAC  -

The database is for sale on the dark web, with records including phone numbers, physical addresses, geolocation data, and inferred salaries.\n The hacker who obtained the data has posted a sample of 1M records, and checks confirm that the data is both genuine and up-to-date \u2026\n  RestorePrivacy reports that the hacker appears to have misused the official LinkedIn API to download the data, the same method used in  a similar breach back in April.\n On June 22nd, a user of a popular hacker advertised data from 700 Million LinkedIn users for sale. The user of the forum posted up a sample of the data that includes 1 million LinkedIn users. We examined the sample and found it to contain the following information:\n  Based on our analysis and cross-checking data from the sample with other publicly available information, it appears all data is authentic and tied to real users. Additionally, the data does appear to be up to date, with samples from 2020 to 2021.\n We reached out directly to the user who is posting the data up for sale on the hacking forum. He claims the data was obtained by exploiting the LinkedIn API to harvest information that people upload to the site.\n No passwords are included, but as the site notes, this is still valuable data that can be used for identity theft and convincing-looking phishing attempts that can themselves be used to obtain login credentials for LinkedIn and other sites.\n With the previous breach, LinkedIn did confirm that the 500M records included data obtained from its servers, but claimed that more than one source was used.  PrivacyShark notes that the company has issued a similar statement this time:\n While we\u2019re still investigating this issue, our initial analysis indicates that the dataset includes information scraped from LinkedIn as well as information obtained from other sources. This was not a LinkedIn data breach and our investigation has determined that no private LinkedIn member data was exposed.

Coming in at a $10 billion market capitalization would make SentinelOne the most valuable cybersecurity IPO to date.\n A source said that the road show has been stronger than anticipated, in part because of the strength of one of its competitors, CrowdStrike, which is publicly traded and currently sitting at a  market cap of $58 billion.\n  The other reason for the response is a slightly grimmer one: Cybersecurity continues to be a major issue for businesses of all sizes, public organizations, governments and individuals. \u201cNo one wants to see another SolarWinds, and there is no reason that there shouldn\u2019t be more than one or two strong players,\u201d a source said.\n As is the bigger trend in cybersecurity, Israel-hatched, Mountain View-based  SentinelOne\u2018s approach to combat that is artificial intelligence \u2014 and in its case specifically, a machine-learning-based solution that it sells under the brand  Singularity that focuses on endpoint security, working across the entire edge of the network to monitor and secure laptops, phones, containerised applications and the many other devices and services connected to a network.\n Last year, endpoint security solutions were estimated to be around an $8 billion market, and analysts project that it could be worth as much as  $18.4 billion by 2024 \u2014 another reason why SentinelOne may have moved up the timetable on its IPO (last year the company\u2019s CEO Tomer Weingarten had told me he thought the company had one or two years left as a private company before considering an IPO, a timeline it clearly decided was worth speeding up).\n SentinelOne  raised $267 million on a $3.1 billion valuation led by Tiger Global as recently as last November, but it has been expanding rapidly. Growth last quarter was 116% compared to the same period a year before, and it now has more than 4,700 customers and annual recurring revenue of $161 million, according to its  S-1 filing. It is also still not profitable, posting a net loss of $64 million in the last quarter.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:52:33", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

to grow our understanding of the company beyond  our EC-1.\n First, we\u2019ll explore the growth of Duolingo\u2019s total user base, how much money it makes per active user, and how effectively the company has managed to convert free users to paid products over time. The numbers will set us up to understand what else can be learned about Duolingo\u2019s business beyond our original deep dive into the company\u2019s finances \u2014 specifically underscoring the pressure cooker it finds itself in when looking for new revenue sources.\n Starting with  Duolingo\u2019s growth in total active users, guess how fast they rose from 2019 to 2020. Hold that number in your head.\n The actual numbers are as follows: In 2019, Duolingo closed the year with 27.3 million monthly active users (MAUs); it wrapped 2020 with 36.7 million MAUs. That\u2019s a gain of 34%. If we narrow our gaze to Q1 2021 numbers compared to Q1 2020, we can see that Duolingo\u2019s MAUs rose from 33.5 million to 39.9 million, or growth of around 19%.\n  The bulk of Duolingo\u2019s growth, then, came in early 2020 when we consider its pandemic bump. Put more simply, the company scaled from 27.3 million MAUs at the end of 2019 to 33.5 million MAUs at the end of Q1 2020; from then, the company added 3.2 million more MAUs throughout 2020 and 6.4 million during the next four quarters.\n Another lens through which to view the numbers is simply a recognition that first-quarter results at Duolingo appear to be stronger than results in the rest of the year, perhaps due to New Year\u2019s resolutions to learn a new language or brush up on a second language learned in high school.\n Next, let\u2019s examine  Duolingo\u2019s monetization efforts regarding converting free users to paying users.\n Here we can see a very different growth story. While the company\u2019s MAUs rose 34% from 2019 to 2020, the company\u2019s paying users rose from 900,000 at the end of 2019 to 1.6 million at the end of 2020. That is a far-sharper gain of 84% on a year-over-year basis.\n So, while Duolingo did see material user growth during 2020, it saw turbo-charged expansion in the users it was able to shake revenue from. Improved monetization, more than acceleration in user growth, was the pandemic\u2019s effect on Duolingo.\n What can we see in the company\u2019s more recent results? From Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, Duolingo\u2019s paid subscribers rose from 1.1 million to 1.8 million, a gain of around 64%. That was a slower pace than the company managed more generally in 2020, which matches Duolingo\u2019s slower revenue growth in Q1 2021 than it recorded in 2020.\n The number is still strong, we think. But not as impressive as the more than 100% revenue expansion that the company put on the board last year.\n In percentage terms, 3.3% of Duolingo\u2019s MAUs were paid subscribers in 2019. That figure rose to 4.4% in 2020. And in Q1 2021, it reached 4.5%. Duolingo rounds that number to 5% in its S-1, which feels somewhat aggressive to us, given the somewhat modest pace at which the metric is improving. Here\u2019s the wording:\n As of March 31, 2021, approximately 5% of our monthly active users were paid subscribers of Duolingo Plus. Our paid subscriber penetration has increased steadily since we launched Duolingo Plus in 2017 and, combined with our user growth, has led to our revenue more than doubling every year since.\n  Next, let\u2019s chat about  revenue per MAU. To get consistent numbers, we\u2019ll divide quarterly revenues by MAU figures from the same period. So, we\u2019ll compare Q4 2019 revenue at Duolingo with its year-end MAU figure. We\u2019ll do the same for 2020, and for Q1 2021 we\u2019ll use both numbers from that period.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:52:15", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u589e\u957f,depicts,duolingo", "title": "Duolingo\u7684S-1\u63cf\u7ed8\u4e86\u4ee4\u4eba\u6bdb\u9aa8\u609a\u7136\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8d27\u5e01\u5316\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u82f1\u8bed\u8ba4\u8bc1 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tDuolingo\u2019s S-1 depicts heady growth, monetization, new focus on English certification\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/duolingos-s-1-depicts-heady-growth-monetization-new-focus-on-english-certification/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u589e\u957f", "depicts", "duolingo"]}]
