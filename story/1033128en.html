They were both in their late 30s, and their short bios indicated that they shared similar views on health and education, had solid incomes and were searching for the same thing: a non-romantic partner to have – and raise – a child with. A co-parent.</p><p>当杰妮卡·安德森(Jenica Anderson)和斯蒂芬·杜瓦尔(Stephan DuVal)在MoDamily.com上点击对方的在线个人资料时-口号是“家庭的新方式”-两人都没有寻找浪漫。他们都快30岁了，他们简短的简历表明，他们在健康和教育方面有着相似的观点，有稳定的收入，并在寻找同样的东西：一个没有浪漫色彩的伴侣来抚养孩子。共同的父母。</p><p> Anderson, 38, a geologist from Montana, US, had matched with and spoken to 10 different men, mostly via so-called mating sites – matchmaking sites for people who want a baby without a romantic relationship – when she had her first phone call with DuVal, from Vancouver, Canada, in spring 2019. Their conversations quickly started to run into the night and, that June, she flew out to spend the weekend with him. They talked, went hiking and jumped into a lake together. “It felt like a date,” says DuVal, 37, a camera operator. “Except we could be totally honest about wanting to have a kid soon, without the goofiness and flirting of a first date. You’re looking to achieve a common goal.”</p><p>现年38岁的安德森是一名来自美国蒙大拿州的地质学家，她在2019年春天与来自加拿大温哥华的杜瓦尔(DuVal)进行了第一次电话交谈，当时她已经与10名不同的男性进行了匹配并交谈，主要是通过所谓的交配网站-为想要孩子而没有浪漫关系的人提供的婚介网站。他们的谈话很快就开始持续到深夜，那年6月，她飞去和他共度周末。他们聊天，徒步旅行，一起跳进湖里。37岁的摄影操作员杜瓦尔(DuVal)说：“感觉就像是在约会。”“除了我们可以完全坦诚地说想很快要个孩子，而不是像第一次约会那样傻乎乎的和调情。”你们正在寻求实现一个共同的目标。“。</p><p> In a world where biological science and equal rights have diversified ways to start a family, platonic co-parenting – the decision to have a child with someone you are not romantically involved with and, in most cases, choose not to live with – remains a relatively new phenomenon.</p><p>在一个生物科学和平等权利有多种方式组建家庭的世界里，柏拉图式的共同育儿-决定与你没有恋爱关系的人生孩子，在大多数情况下，选择不一起生活-仍然是一个相对较新的现象。</p><p> Well established in gay communities, along with egg and sperm donation, it is on the rise among heterosexual singles. Tens of thousands have signed up to matchmaking sites at a cost of around £100 a year. On  Coparents.co.uk, which launched in Europe in 2008, two-thirds of its 120,000 worldwide members are straight. Modamily, which launched in LA in 2012, has 30,000 international members, of whom 80% are straight and 2,000 are British. UK-based competitor  PollenTree.com has 53,000 members, split 60/40 women to men, and ranks its domestic market as its strongest. During lockdown, the latter two sites reported traffic surges of 30-50%.</p><p>随着卵子和精子捐赠在同性恋社区得到了很好的确立，它在异性单身人群中正在上升。数以万计的人注册了婚介网站，每年的费用约为100 GB。在2008年在欧洲推出的Coparents.co.uk上，其全球12万会员中有三分之二是异性恋。MoDamly于2012年在洛杉矶成立，拥有3万名国际会员，其中80%是异性恋，2000名是英国人。总部位于英国的竞争对手PollenTree.com拥有5.3万会员，女性与男性的比例为60/40，并将其国内市场列为最强劲的市场。在封锁期间，后两个网站报告的流量激增了30%-50%。</p><p> Prof Susan Golombok, director of the University of Cambridge’s Centre for Family Research and author of  We Are Family , a new book examining the wellbeing of children in structures beyond the nuclear unit, has researched new family forms since the 1980s. She has studied families created via IVF, sperm and egg donation, and surrogacy, as well as lesbian mother families, gay father families and single mothers by choice.</p><p>苏珊·戈伦博克教授是剑桥大学家庭研究中心主任，也是“我们是家庭”(We Are Family)一书的作者，这本新书考察了核心单元以外的结构中儿童的福祉。自20世纪80年代以来，她一直在研究新的家庭形式。她研究了通过试管受精、精子和卵子捐赠和代孕创建的家庭，以及选择的女同性恋母亲家庭、同性恋父亲家庭和单身母亲。</p><p> Golombok’s team turned their attention to elective co-parenting as an emerging trend in 2015. They are now following 50 families in what they believe to be the world’s first study considering the impact of the arrangement on children.</p><p>Golombok的团队将注意力转向选择性共同育儿，这是2015年的一种新兴趋势。他们现在正在跟踪50个家庭，他们认为这是世界上第一个考虑到这一安排对儿童影响的研究。</p><p>  She says: “It was a gradual realisation that this was a new phenomenon picking up speed. The main question for us is how does this relationship between parents, where there is no romantic relationship, develop, with each other and the child? Is the relationship breakdown rate higher or lower? Very early findings suggest that how well the parents communicate with each other and collaborate over childcare seems to make a big difference.”</p><p>她表示：“人们逐渐意识到，这是一种正在加速发展的新现象。对于我们来说，主要的问题是，这种没有浪漫关系的父母之间的关系是如何发展的，彼此之间和孩子之间是如何发展的？关系破裂的比率是高还是低？早期的研究结果表明，父母之间在育儿问题上的沟通和合作似乎有很大的不同。</p><p> The quality of parents’ relationships with one another, and their level of intimacy, has a large bearing on children’s welfare, she says. “It is possible, though, that taking away romantic baggage could even make for a more stable environment.”</p><p>她说，父母之间关系的质量，以及他们的亲密程度，对孩子的福利有很大的影响。“不过，除去浪漫的包袱甚至可以创造一个更稳定的环境，这是有可能的。”</p><p> Anderson already had a young son – she split from his father when he was one. She signed up to two websites in early 2019. She wanted the opportunities that having two parents in a child’s life could bring. However, she lived in a small community where there was no one willing to enter into a co-parenting arrangement, and had already considered and dismissed men she had dated before.</p><p>安德森已经有了一个年幼的儿子-在他父亲一岁的时候，她就和他父亲离婚了。她在2019年初注册了两个网站。她想要在孩子的生活中有两个父母能带来的机会。然而，她住在一个小社区，那里没有人愿意加入共同育儿安排，并且已经考虑并解雇了她以前约会过的男人。</p><p> “I really didn’t want a romantic connection; I thought it would convolute things,” she says. “I’d seen the traditional recipe not work out. [Stephan and I] had a shared sense of direction – raising a happy child who makes it through life OK. My ex and I are very amicable co-parents, and that showed me there were real strengths to doing it this way. I wanted to tap into the stuff that’s good for the kid – a functional dynamic and a stable life. Stephan and I asked ourselves, ‘Can we be allies and ensure that any future kid gets the best?’ If it was just about parenting, we could remain pragmatic. I wanted to grow my family with somebody who wanted to be a doting father and wasn’t just having a baby for me.”</p><p>“我真的不想要浪漫的联系；我认为这会让事情变得复杂，”她说。“我看到传统的食谱行不通。(斯蒂芬和我)有一个共同的方向感--养育一个幸福的孩子，让他度过一生。我的前任和我是非常友好的共同父母，这向我展示了这样做的真正力量。我想利用对孩子有好处的东西-功能动态和稳定的生活。斯蒂芬和我问自己，‘我们能成为盟友，确保任何未来的孩子都能得到最好的吗？’如果这仅仅是关于育儿，我们可以保持务实。我想和一个想做一个溺爱我的父亲的人一起发展我的家庭，而不仅仅是给我生个孩子。“。</p><p> Her parents weren’t so convinced. “I’m pretty sure [they] lost a lot of sleep over what I was doing. My father worried about finances. On some level, they probably worried about the morality.”</p><p>她的父母并不是很信服。“我很肯定(他们)因为我的所作所为而睡不着觉。我父亲担心财政问题。在某种程度上，他们可能担心道德问题。“。</p><p> More than 800 miles away, DuVal, frustrated by his efforts to meet someone who shared his desire for children, had also subscribed to Modamily. “I wanted a child to give life more meaning; a lot of people I know are married to their jobs,” he says. “I hoped that, maybe, I’d find romance eventually, but [for me] it was time to start a family.”</p><p>在800多英里之外，杜瓦尔也订阅了MoDamly，因为他努力去见一个和他一样想要孩子的人，这让他感到沮丧。“我想要一个孩子，让生活更有意义；我认识的很多人都嫁给了自己的工作，”他说。“我希望，也许，我最终会找到浪漫，但(对我来说)是时候组建一个家庭了。”</p><p> He met three other possible matches before connecting with Anderson. He admired her bravery, parenting style and family ties. “The big fear was that I’d match with someone who turns out to be a terrible human. But my fear quickly disappeared. We spoke a lot about child-raising scenarios. We were often on the same page. We talked about our own lives, what shaped us, past relationships.”</p><p>在与安德森联系之前，他还遇到了另外三场可能的比赛。他钦佩她的勇敢、育儿方式和家庭纽带。“最大的恐惧是我会和一个被证明是一个可怕的人类的人配对。但我的恐惧很快就消失了。我们谈了很多关于养育孩子的情景。我们经常意见一致。我们谈到了我们自己的生活，是什么塑造了我们，谈了过去的关系。“。</p><p> Anderson was drawn to his sense of adventure and flexibility. She says: “If unpredictable things came our way, [I felt] he could adapt. He had great dad qualities. I quickly felt confident in this really unknown and unconventional partnership.”</p><p>安德森被他的冒险精神和灵活性所吸引。她说：“如果我们遇到不可预测的事情，(我觉得)他可以适应。他有很好的父亲气质。我很快就对这种真正不为人知的、非常规的合作关系充满信心。“。</p><p>  By the end of that June weekend, they returned to their lives having found the person they wanted to parent with. By September, they had conceived – naturally – and were pregnant. “Going into this, I presumed getting pregnant would be clinical, but once we spent time together we decided to try naturally,” says Anderson. “I tracked my ovulation, and we fell pregnant during a road trip on the west coast.” (Most co-parenting partnerships either have sex or choose the “turkey baster” method of artificial insemination at home. Some choose IVF.)</p><p>到6月的那个周末结束时，他们找到了想要为人父母的人，回到了自己的生活中。到了9月份，他们自然而然地怀孕了，并且怀孕了。安德森说：“在这方面，我认为怀孕是临床上的，但一旦我们在一起度过了一段时间，我们就决定自然地尝试。”“我记录了我的排卵情况，我们在西海岸的一次公路旅行中怀孕了。”(大多数共同育儿伙伴要么发生性行为，要么选择在家中进行人工授精的“火鸡膏”方法。一些人选择试管受精。)。</p><p>   As Golombok’s team were noticing the rise of this new family unit, Oliver and Kate were imagining what their own might look like. Oliver had tried for years to have a baby in his former relationship. In his 40s, the relationship ended, but his desire to become a dad did not, and he logged on to  The Stork, a London-based site which has been responsible for 15 babies since it started matchmaking “people ready to be parents” five years ago.</p><p>当Golombok的团队注意到这个新的家庭单元的崛起时，奥利弗和凯特正在想象他们自己的家庭可能会是什么样子。奥利弗在他以前的恋情中多年来一直想要个孩子。在他40多岁的时候，这段关系结束了，但他想成为父亲的愿望并没有结束，他登录了总部位于伦敦的网站The Stork，自从五年前开始为“准备为人父母的人”牵线搭桥以来，该网站已经负责了15个婴儿。</p><p> “So many of my mates had children and ended up with disastrous, costly divorces, only seeing their kids irregularly,” says Oliver. “I thought it would be better to get on with somebody as a mate and have a baby without wasting time.”</p><p>奥利弗说：“我的很多朋友都有孩子，结果却以灾难性的、代价高昂的离婚收场，只是不定期地见他们的孩子。”“我想最好还是和别人好好相处，不要浪费时间，生个孩子。”</p><p> He was introduced to Kate, and they scored 93% in a compatibility test through the agency, which sits at the top end of the market, charging £4k-£10k for its bespoke membership packages. These include Plan A, for prospective parents hoping to find romance, too, and Plan B, for those only wanting to co-parent. Oliver and Kate embarked on Plan A, but, after a few dates, and going to bed together, quickly switched to the platonic option.</p><p>他被介绍给凯特，他们在通过该机构进行的兼容性测试中获得了93%的分数，该机构位于市场的高端，对其定制的会员套餐收取GB4k-GB10k的费用。这些计划包括A计划，为希望找到浪漫爱情的未来父母制定的计划，以及B计划，为那些只想共同为人父母的人制定的计划。奥利弗和凯特开始了A计划，但在几次约会后，一起上床后，很快就转向了柏拉图式的选择。</p><p> “Nothing blossomed romantically,” says Oliver. “But our principles for raising a child were the same – fun and spontaneity; not too indulgent; education was important. It felt straightforward. Kate takes me as I am. She is compromising, undemanding and easy to deal with.”</p><p>奥利弗说：“没有什么是浪漫的。”“但是我们养育孩子的原则是一样的--乐趣和自发性；不要太放纵；教育很重要。感觉很直截了当。凯特接受我本来的样子。她很妥协，要求不高，也很容易相处。“。</p><p> Kate says: “I set out to meet someone I’d be with for ever, but I was in my late 30s, time was ticking, my fertility was not that great, and having a child was very important to me. Oliver’s kind and gallant; he would protect us both. We got on extremely well.”</p><p>凯特说：“我开始去见一个我会永远在一起的人，但我快30岁了，时间不多了，我的生育能力不是很好，生个孩子对我来说非常重要。”奥利弗是个善良而勇敢的人，他会保护我们俩的。我们相处得非常好。“。</p><p> Kate became pregnant four months later. As she and Oliver had already slept together in the early weeks of dating, having sex to try for their baby felt like the obvious approach. “During the pregnancy, we did all the things you would with a regular, long-term partner: scans, shopping for baby stuff, texts when the baby kicked,” says Oliver. “I was at the birth, too.”</p><p>四个月后，凯特怀孕了。由于她和奥利弗在约会的最初几周就已经睡在了一起，所以通过做爱来试着怀上他们的孩子似乎是一种显而易见的方式。奥利弗说：“在怀孕期间，我们做了所有你会和一个固定的长期伴侣做的事情：扫描，买婴儿用品，当婴儿踢的时候发短信。”“分娩时我也在场。”</p><p> But it was not entirely straightforward. Fearful of the prejudice that co-parenting families frequently face, Oliver and Kate (not their real names) have, to this day, pretended to family and friends that they were in a relationship from when they met until their son was 18 months old.</p><p>但这并不是完全直截了当的。由于担心共同育儿家庭经常面临的偏见，奥利弗和凯特(化名)直到今天还在向家人和朋友假装他们从相遇到儿子18个月大都在谈恋爱。</p><p>  Kate says: “Oliver moved into my spare room until we faked splitting up. It was a farce. Both our families are quite conservative. Even now, only one or two friends know the truth. We should be able to live our lives without fear of judgment, but the reality is that having a child through a one-night stand probably feels more acceptable to people than this.”</p><p>凯特说：“奥利弗搬到我的空余房间，直到我们假装分手。那是一场闹剧。我们两家都相当保守。即使是现在，也只有一两个朋友知道真相。我们应该可以生活在不害怕评判的情况下，但现实是，通过一夜情生孩子的感觉可能比这更容易被人们接受。“。</p><p> Oliver adds: “People are judgmental about changing the course of reproduction, manufacturing a family, even when the typical way often doesn’t work out.”</p><p>奥利弗补充道：“人们对改变生育过程、组建家庭持批判态度，即使通常的方式往往行不通。”</p><p> Now aged four, their son spends every other weekend and one night a week at his dad’s; the pair live within an hour’s drive of each other. They go on family days out, and spend Christmas and birthdays together. Both describe their relationship now as one akin to best mates.</p><p>他们的儿子现在4岁，每隔一个周末和一周一个晚上在他父亲家度过；这对夫妇住在距离彼此不到一小时车程的地方。他们在家庭日外出，一起过圣诞节和生日。两人现在都将他们的关系描述为一种类似于最好的伴侣的关系。</p><p> “We’re always laughing,” says Kate. “We’re on the same wavelength, and our priority is our son, who is an affectionate, physical, happy little boy. We respect each other. When Oliver picks him up or drops him off, he comes in for tea; I know plenty of divorced couples where the dad sits outside in the car. We both believe that men and women bring different things to a child’s life.”</p><p>“我们总是在笑，”凯特说。“我们志同道合，我们的首要任务是我们的儿子，他是一个充满深情、身体健康、快乐的小男孩。我们互相尊重。当奥利弗接送他时，他会进来喝茶；我认识很多离婚夫妇，父亲坐在外面的车里。我们都认为男人和女人给孩子的生活带来了不同的东西。“。</p><p> Both now have new partners, who have children from previous relationships. Oliver says: “There’s none of the animosity that often comes with exes. We all spent last Christmas together; there were seven children there. I hope our son sees [in his parents] a great bond between two people who give him the love and support he needs. We will explain that to him as he grows up.”</p><p>两人现在都有了新的伴侣，他们都有了以前恋情中的孩子。奥利弗说：“没有前任经常会带来的敌意。去年圣诞节我们都在一起度过，那里有七个孩子。我希望我们的儿子(在他的父母身上)看到两个人之间的巨大纽带，他们给了他所需要的爱和支持。等他长大后，我们会向他解释这一点。“。</p><p> Had she been 29, Kate says she might not have chosen this path to parenthood, but she adds: “I think there are far worse ways to bring a child into this world. I’ve got my baby and the love of my life, but through two different men. Our son doesn’t see mummy and daddy kissing and cuddling in the same house, but he sees that he’s loved and wanted, very much, by both of us.”</p><p>凯特说，如果她29岁，她可能不会选择这条为人父母的道路，但她补充说：“我认为把孩子带到这个世界上还有更糟糕的方式。我得到了我的孩子和我一生的挚爱，但是通过两个不同的男人。我们的儿子没有看到妈妈和爸爸在同一个房子里亲吻和拥抱，但他看到我们两个人都非常爱他，非常想要他。“。</p><p>  Unlike surrogacy, for example, which has percolated into the public consciousness, partly thanks to celebrities such as Elton John and Kim Kardashian West, platonic co-parenting remains little understood and less spoken about. Sites are overrepresented by members working in the media, senior civil service, law, medicine and banking, where privacy is prized, says Patrick Harrison, founder of  PollenTree.com.</p><p>例如，与代孕不同，代孕已经渗透到公众意识中，这在一定程度上要归功于埃尔顿·约翰(Elton John)和金·卡戴珊·韦斯特(Kim Kardashian West)等名人，而柏拉图式的共同育儿仍然鲜为人知，谈论也较少。PollenTree.com的创始人帕特里克·哈里森(Patrick Harrison)表示，在媒体、高级公务员、法律、医药和银行工作的成员在网站上的比例过高，这些领域珍视隐私。</p><p> “There are a lot of people in this country who probably don’t share a view that it’s a great thing, and they can be vocal,” he says. “Our members keep a low profile because it’s nobody else’s business. They don’t need the rest of society to tell them it’s a good or bad thing.”</p><p>他说：“在这个国家，可能有很多人不认同这是一件伟大的事情，他们可以直言不讳。”“我们的会员都很低调，因为这不关别人的事。他们不需要社会上的其他人来告诉他们这是件好事还是坏事。“。</p><p> These concerns may not be completely unfounded, says Golombok, but there are upsides. “People still see the traditional family as the gold standard, and every other kind is measured against that. But the overarching finding of our research, over 40 years, is that these are well-adjusted families, sometimes more so than traditional ones. These are wanted children. The biggest concern is whether these children might be stigmatised, judged or bullied because of their family.”</p><p>Golombok说，这些担忧可能不是完全没有根据的，但也有好处。“人们仍然把传统家庭视为黄金标准，其他任何类型的家庭都是以此为标准来衡量的。但我们40多年的研究最重要的发现是，这些家庭都是适应良好的家庭，有时比传统家庭更适应。这些是被通缉的孩子。最大的担忧是，这些孩子是否会因为他们的家庭而受到污名、评判或欺凌。“。</p><p> Golombok writes in her book: “From our studies of new family forms that have emerged since the 1970s –– families that were considered threatening and objectionable when they first appeared –– it seems likely that many of the fears about future families will turn out to be unjustified.”</p><p>Golombok在她的书中写道：“从我们对20世纪70年代以来出现的新家庭形式的研究来看，这些家庭最初出现时被认为是危险和令人反感的，似乎对未来家庭的许多担忧最终都是没有道理的。”</p><p> Despite the many changes in family makeup over recent decades, Golombok says it is hard to know, yet, whether elective co-parenting will become commonplace. It is not without difficulty and, as with any relationship, these partnerships can break down, too.</p><p>尽管近几十年来家庭结构发生了许多变化，但Golombok表示，目前还很难知道选择性共同育儿是否会变得司空见惯。这并不是一帆风顺的，就像任何关系一样，这些伙伴关系也可能破裂。</p><p> Amy, 37, had her daughter, Emma, six years ago after approaching a friend of almost a decade to raise a child together. They both longed to be parents, shared views on healthcare and schooling, and lived 15 minutes apart, in California. They talked over their plan for three months, before falling pregnant at the first attempt.</p><p>艾米，37岁，六年前生下了她的女儿艾玛，此前她联系了一位认识了近十年的朋友，一起抚养孩子。他们都渴望为人父母，对医疗保健和学校教育有着共同的看法，住在加利福尼亚州，相隔15分钟。在第一次尝试怀孕之前，他们讨论了三个月的计划。</p><p>  She says: “For years, I wanted the big love. I ended up with a very broken heart, but still wanted a baby. I could have paid $500 at the sperm bank, but I was pretty sure I could do it for free. If I couldn’t have the big dream, this felt like the next best thing.” The sex, she says, was “something I had to get a bit drunk for. I was so determined to make a baby, though – I was a woman on a mission. I did ‘enjoy’ it, but I wouldn’t do it again with someone I didn’t really want to have sex with, even for a baby.”</p><p>她说：“多年来，我一直想要大爱。我最终心碎了，但仍然想要一个孩子。我本来可以在精子银行付500美元，但我很确定我可以免费做这件事。如果我不能有远大的梦想，这感觉就像是下一个最好的事情。“。她说，性爱是“我不得不喝得有点醉的东西”。尽管如此，我还是下定决心要生个孩子--我是一个肩负使命的女人。我确实‘享受’了，但我不会再和一个我不想和之发生性关系的人再做一次，即使是为了一个婴儿。“。</p><p> While Amy’s mother was excited about having a grandchild, her father thought it was an “awful” choice. “Friends of friends would tell each other they were outraged I was ‘starting from a broken home’,” she remembers.</p><p>当艾米的母亲对有了孙子感到兴奋时，她的父亲认为这是一个“可怕的”选择。“朋友们的朋友会告诉对方，他们对我‘从一个破碎的家庭开始’感到愤怒，”她回忆道。</p><p> When Emma was a newborn, Amy’s co-parent slept on her sofa to help with night feeds. As she grew, they established 50/50 parenting, working opposite ends of the day so both enjoyed daily time with their daughter. “There were moments when I thought ‘Thank God for him’,” she says.</p><p>当艾玛还是个新生儿的时候，艾米的共同父母就睡在她的沙发上，帮她准备夜间的食物。随着她的成长，他们建立了50/50的育儿方式，每天工作的时间截然不同，所以两人都享受着每天与女儿在一起的时光。“有那么几个时刻，我想‘感谢上帝赐予他’，”她说。</p><p> “I had an open-door policy. I organised family photos, pumpkin picking on Halloween, and we spent Christmas and Thanksgiving together. I hoped my child would have a loving, engaged mother and father. We had our social, dating and professional lives; she had two families who love her. It seemed to work well.”</p><p>“我的政策是开放的。我整理了全家福，在万圣节采摘南瓜，我们一起过圣诞节和感恩节。我希望我的孩子能有一对慈爱的、敬业的父亲和母亲。我们有自己的社交、约会和职业生活；她有两个爱她的家庭。看起来效果不错。“。</p><p> But, speaking days after mediation in a custody battle she describes as “the biggest imaginable nightmare”, Amy now recognises that cracks appeared before Emma was born.</p><p>但是，在一场监护权之争的调解几天后，艾米将其描述为“可以想象的最大的噩梦”，她现在承认，裂缝在艾玛出生之前就已经出现了。</p><p> “Having sex to conceive was probably confusing for us both. There was a shift. He started calling me ‘hun’ and ‘babe’. He was hoping for a relationship,” she says. Boundaries became a source of tension. “We went to therapy together soon after [Emma] was born. My big fear was being separated from her; his was being left out.”</p><p>“做爱来怀孕可能会让我们两个都感到困惑。发生了转变。他开始叫我“哼”和“宝贝”。他希望能有一段感情，“她说。边界成了紧张的根源。“(艾玛)出生后不久，我们就一起去接受治疗。我最大的恐惧就是和她分开，他的被遗漏了。“</p><p> In the UK, co-parents can draw up a private agreement of terms, but the paperwork is unenforceable in court – in a custody battle, a judge would only consider what was in the best interests of the child.</p><p>在英国，共同父母可以起草一份私人的条款协议，但文书工作在法庭上是不可执行的-在监护权争夺战中，法官只会考虑什么是对孩子最有利的。</p><p> “If someone was to say now, ‘Should I co-parent?’ I’d say, ‘Absolutely not,’” says Amy. “People used to ask me how I’d protect myself: you can’t. I have a gorgeous, smart, empathic daughter, but it’s much like going through a divorce. The whole point of co-parenting was to avoid that.”</p><p>“如果现在有人说，‘我应该共同为人父母吗？’我会说，‘绝对不会，’“艾米说。“人们过去常常问我如何保护自己：你不能。我有一个漂亮、聪明、有同理心的女儿，但这很像是在经历离婚。”共同育儿的全部意义就是为了避免这种情况。“。</p><p> She adds: “I feel a lot of shame because I chose this. I thought I could make it work. Looking back, I wonder if I really felt my child needed a father, or whether that was societal pressure?”</p><p>她补充说：“我感到非常羞愧，因为我选择了这个。我以为我能行得通。回首往事，不知是真的觉得孩子需要父亲，还是社会压力？“。</p><p>  It is impossible to calculate how many children have been born this way; bigger websites unscientifically guess that they have been responsible for about 1,000 births each.</p><p>不可能计算出有多少孩子是这样出生的；更大的网站不科学地猜测，他们每个人都要为大约1000名新生儿负责。</p><p> In their 2015 study  Friendly Allies, Golombok’s Cambridge team found that the main motivation for seeking a co-parent online was wanting a child to know both biological parents. Others included concern about getting older, and sharing the financial cost of parenting.</p><p>在他们2015年的友好学习盟友中，Golombok的剑桥团队发现，在网上寻找共同父母的主要动机是希望孩子认识亲生父母。其他包括对变老的担忧，以及分担育儿的经济成本。</p><p> Sites invest a great deal in moderation, to eliminate scammers. For example, if a man using PollenTree specifies natural insemination only, he is treated with suspicion and his profile is closed down. “The stakes are very high, and we need to sleep at night,” says Harrison.</p><p>网站进行大量的适度投资，以消除诈骗者。例如，如果一名使用PollenTree的男子只指定自然受精，他将受到怀疑，他的个人资料将被关闭。“赌注非常高，我们需要在晚上睡觉，”哈里森说。</p><p>  LA-based Ivan Fatovic worked in film and TV before he founded Modamily in 2012, after a conversation with a group of girlfriends tiring of the dating game. The site’s first baby was born the following year. Members pay $29.99 a month (£23), and are asked to rank what they value in a co-parent. They are matched by algorithms; fields include income, health, creativity and physical appearance. A bespoke concierge service, where the site vets potential matches for you, is available for $2,000-10,000 (£1,550-£7,750).</p><p>洛杉矶的伊万·法托维奇(Ivan Fatovic)在与一群厌倦了约会游戏的女友交谈后，于2012年创立MoDamly之前，曾在电影和电视行业工作。第二年，该网站的第一个婴儿出生了。会员每月支付29.99美元(GB 23)，并被要求对共同父母的价值进行排名。它们通过算法进行匹配；领域包括收入、健康、创造力和外貌。定制的礼宾服务，网站为你审查潜在的匹配，价格为2,000-10,000美元(1,550-7,750 GB)。</p><p> “Tinder caters for 18- to 25-year-olds; we cater for people in their 30s and 40s,” says Fatovic. “On a first date, saying, ‘I want three kids in the next five years’, is not something people, particularly men, want to hear. [But] everyone on the site is thinking about having a child sooner or later. The divorce rate means that living in two separate homes, when mom and dad might have new partners, is not unusual. Modern arrangements, like Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin’s ‘conscious uncoupling’ were already happening, there just wasn’t a name for it.</p><p>法托维奇说：“Tinder服务的对象是18-25岁的年轻人；我们的服务对象是30多岁和40多岁的人。”“第一次约会时说，‘我想在未来五年内生三个孩子’，这不是人们，尤其是男性想听到的。[但是]网站上的每个人都在考虑早晚要孩子。离婚率意味着，当父母可能有新伴侣的时候，住在两个不同的家里并不少见。像格温妮丝·帕特洛(Gwyneth Paltrow)和克里斯·马丁(Chris Martin)的“有意识的分离”这样的现代编排已经在发生，只是没有名字而已。</p><p> “People have started to recognise that the person you have kids with may not be the person you grow old with – but they still want the influences of both a mother and father in their child’s life. They want that consistency, financial help and support system.”</p><p>“人们已经开始认识到，和你生孩子的人可能不是和你一起变老的那个人--但他们仍然希望在孩子的生活中既有父母的影响，也有父亲的影响。”他们想要那种连贯性、财政帮助和支持系统。“。</p><p> Like The Stork, Modamily also features a romance option, for those searching for a long-term partner too. “I find when two straight people meet on the site it often goes down the romance path,” says Fatovic.</p><p>和鹳一样，MoDamly也有一个浪漫的选择，适合那些也在寻找长期伴侣的人。法托维奇说：“我发现当两个异性恋的人在网站上相遇时，他们往往会沿着浪漫的道路走下去。”</p><p>  Anderson and DuVal may not have clicked for love – but it followed anyway. By the time they said goodbye after that first weekend by the lake, there were the makings of deeper feelings. By the time Anderson was pregnant three months later, they were a couple, despite her intentions to the contrary.</p><p>安德森和杜瓦尔可能并没有因为爱情而合拍-但不管怎样，这一切都随之而来。当他们在湖边度过第一个周末后告别时，已经有了更深层次的感情。三个月后，安德森怀孕时，他们成了一对夫妇，尽管她的意图与之相反。</p><p> “Ultimately, I ended up falling for Stephan for the same reason I chose to parent with him: it was easy to communicate, share information, be honest and vulnerable with one another,” she says.</p><p>她说：“最终，我爱上了斯蒂芬，原因与我选择与他一起为人父母的原因相同：很容易沟通，分享信息，彼此诚实而脆弱。”</p><p> “She’s the first girl my parents met in a decade,” adds DuVal.</p><p>“她是我父母十年来遇到的第一个女孩，”杜瓦尔补充道。</p><p>  They welcomed their daughter into the world on a sunny, mid-June day in Montana, where they’ve made their family home. They remain a couple, but wherever their romance takes them, parenting together remains their priority. “I think it’s possible to go into this without falling in love, but there are benefits of having fallen for each other,” says DuVal. “Without that, there would have been all these moments during the pregnancy, when I wasn’t needed, that I’d have missed. I wanted to be around and she wanted me there.</p><p>六月中旬一个阳光明媚的日子，他们在蒙大拿州迎来了他们的女儿来到这个世界，他们在那里安家。他们仍然是一对情侣，但无论他们的罗曼史把他们带到哪里，共同为人父母仍然是他们的首要任务。杜瓦尔说：“我认为在不坠入爱河的情况下进入这一领域是可能的，但彼此坠入爱河也是有好处的。”“如果没有这一点，怀孕期间就会有很多我不需要的时候，我会错过这些时刻。我想和她在一起，她也想让我去。</p><p> “Everyone asks how we met. If I don’t know them well, I just say ‘online’. If I had to date again, I would start in the open and honest way we did. It’s a stronger foundation.”</p><p>“每个人都问我们是怎么认识的。如果我不太了解他们，我只会说“在线”。如果让我再约会一次，我会开诚布公地开始我们的约会。这是一个更坚实的基础。“。</p><p> Gazing on her expanded family in the warmth of their newborn bubble, Anderson says she takes none of it for granted. “We have these ideas of what relationships or romance look like. I think deciding to co-parent is, in some ways, falling in love with someone – even if it’s not a romantic love.”</p><p>安德森在新生儿泡沫的温暖中凝视着她扩大的家庭，说她并不认为这是理所当然的。“我们对关系或浪漫是什么样的有这些想法。我认为，在某种程度上，决定共同为人父母就是爱上了一个人--即使这不是一段浪漫的爱情。“</p><p> • Names and some identifying details have been changed.
