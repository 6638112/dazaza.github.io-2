The center has the nation’s only federal quarantine facility and its largest biocontainment unit, which cared for airlifted Ebola patients in 2014. The people on staff had detailed pandemic plans. They ran drills. Ron Klain, who was President Barack Obama’s “Ebola czar” and will be Joe Biden’s chief of staff in the White House, once told me that UNMC is “arguably the best in the country” at handling dangerous and unusual diseases. There’s a reason many of the Americans who were  airlifted from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in February were sent to UNMC.</p><p> 2003年SARS爆发后，其工作人员开始专门为新兴感染做准备。该中心拥有美国唯一的联邦检疫设施和最大的生物遏制单位，该单位在2014年对空运的埃博拉病人进行了护理。工作人员制定了详细的大流行计划。他们进行了演习。罗恩·克莱恩曾经是巴拉克·奥巴马总统的“埃博拉沙皇”，将担任乔·拜登在白宫的参谋长。他曾告诉我，联MC在处理危险和异常疾病方面“可以说是全美最好的”。有理由将许多在2月从“钻石公主”号游轮上空运过来的美国人送往联合国军。</p><p>   In the past two weeks, the hospital had to convert an entire building into a COVID-19 tower, from the top down. It now has 10 COVID-19 units, each taking up an entire hospital floor. Three of the units provide intensive care to the very sickest people, several of whom die every day. One unit solely provides “comfort care” to COVID-19 patients who are certain to die. “We’ve never had to do anything like this,” Angela Hewlett, the infectious-disease specialist who directs the hospital’s COVID-19 team, told me. “We are on an absolutely catastrophic path.”</p><p>   在过去的两个星期中，医院不得不将整个建筑从上到下转换为COVID-19塔。现在，它有10个COVID-19单元，每个单元占据整个医院楼层。其中三个单位为重病患者提供重症监护，其中许多人每天死亡。一个单位专门为肯定死亡的COVID-19患者提供“舒适护理”。指导医院COVID-19小组的传染病专家Angela Hewlett告诉我：“我们从来不需要做这样的事情。” “我们走上了绝对的灾难性道路。”</p><p>  To hear such talk from someone at UNMC, the best-prepared of America’s hospitals, should shake the entire nation. In mid-March, when just 18 Nebraskans had tested positive for COVID-19, Shelly Schwedhelm, the head of the hospital’s emergency-preparedness program, sounded gently confident. Or, at least, she told me: “I’m confident in having a plan.” She hoped the hospital wouldn’t hit capacity, “because people will have done the right thing by staying home,” she said. And people did: For a while, the U.S. flattened the curve.</p><p>  听到准备最充分的美国医院-联合国军司令部某人的讲话，应该会动摇整个国家。 3月中旬，当只有18个内布拉斯加州人的COVID-19测试呈阳性时，该医院紧急情况预防计划负责人雪莉·史威瑟姆（Shelly Schwedhelm）听起来有些自信。至少，她告诉我：“我对制定计划充满信心。”她希望医院不会造成人满为患，“因为人们呆在家里会做正确的事，”她说。人们做到了：一段时间以来，美国使曲线变得平坦。</p><p>  But now about 2,400 Nebraskans are testing positive for COVID-19 every day—a rate five times higher than in the spring. More than  20 percent of tests are coming back positive, and up to 70 percent in some rural counties—signs that many infections aren’t being detected. The number of people who’ve been hospitalized with the disease has  tripled in just six weeks. UNMC is fuller with COVID-19 patients—and patients, full stop—than it has ever been. “We’re watching a system breaking in front of us and we’re helpless to stop it,” says Kelly Cawcutt, an infectious-disease and critical-care physician.</p><p>但是现在每天大约有2,400名内布拉斯加州人的COVID-19测试呈阳性，这一比率是春季的五倍。超过20％的检测结果呈阳性，在某些农村县高达70％，这表明许多感染没有被发现。在短短六个星期内，该病住院的人数增加了两倍。 UNMC的COVID-19患者比以往任何时候都更加充实，而患者则是一站式服务。传染病和重症监护医师Kelly Cawcutt说：“我们正在目睹一个系统即将崩溃的事实，我们无助于阻止它。”</p><p>   Cawcutt knows what’s coming. Throughout the pandemic, hospitalizations have lagged behind cases by about 12 days.  Over the past 12 days, the total number of confirmed cases in Nebraska has risen from 82,400 to 109,280. That rise represents a wave of patients that will slam into already beleaguered hospitals between now and Thanksgiving. “I don’t see how we avoid becoming overwhelmed,” says Dan Johnson, a critical-care doctor. People need to know that “the assumption we will always have a hospital bed for them is a false one.”</p><p>   Cawcutt知道会发生什么。在整个大流行中，住院时间落后于病例约12天。在过去的12天里，内布拉斯加州已确诊的病例总数从82,400上升至109,280。这种上升代表了一波病人，从现在到感恩节之间，他们将饱受折磨。 “我看不到如何避免不知所措，”重症监护医生丹·约翰逊（Dan Johnson）说。人们需要知道“我们将永远为他们提供病床的假设是错误的。”</p><p>  What makes this “nightmare” worse, he adds, “is that it was preventable.” The coronavirus is not unstoppable,  as some have suggested and as New Zealand, Iceland, Australia, and Hong Kong  have resoundingly disproved—twice. Instead,  the Trump administration never mounted a serious effort to stop it. Whether through gross incompetence or  deliberate strategy, the president and his advisers left the virus to run amok, allowed Americans to get sick, and punted the consequences to the health-care system. And they did so repeatedly, even after the ordeal of the spring, after the playbook for controlling the virus became clear, and despite months of warnings about a fall surge.</p><p>  他补充说，使这种“噩梦”变得更糟的是“这是可以预防的。”正如某些人所暗示的那样，并且正如新西兰，冰岛，澳大利亚和香港的反对声令人震惊地两次一样，冠状病毒并非不可阻挡。取而代之的是，特朗普政府从未认真努力制止它。不管是通过完全无能还是采取有计划的策略，总统及其顾问都让病毒肆虐，让美国人生病，并对医疗体系造成了严重后果。他们甚至反复地这样做，即使在春季的苦难之后，控制病毒的剧本明确之后，尽管几个月来都警告人们跌倒的警告。</p><p> Not even the best-prepared hospital can compensate for an unchecked pandemic. UNMC’s preparations didn’t fail so much as the U.S. created a situation in which hospitals could not possibly succeed. “We can prepare over and over for a wave of patients,” says Cawcutt, “but we can’t prepare for a tsunami.”</p><p> 甚至准备最好的医院也无法弥补未经检查的大流行。 UNMC的准备工作并没有失败，因为美国造成了医院无法成功的局面。 Cawcutt说：“我们可以为一波又一波的病人做一遍又一遍的准备，但是我们不能为海啸做准备。”</p><p>  A full hospital means that everyone waits. COVID-19 patients who are going downhill must wait to enter a packed intensive-care unit. Patients who cannot breathe must wait for the many minutes it takes for a nurse elsewhere in the hospital to remove cumbersome protective gear, run over, and don the gear again. On Tuesday, one rapidly deteriorating patient needed to be  intubated, but the assembled doctors had to wait, because the anesthesiologists were all busy intubating four other patients in an ICU and a few more in an emergency room.</p><p>  一个完整的医院意味着每个人都在等待。下坡的COVID-19患者必须等待进入挤满人的重症监护病房。无法呼吸的患者必须等待医院其他地方的护士花费大量时间才能卸下笨重的防护装备，跑过去并再次穿上该装备。周二，需要对一名迅速恶化的患者进行插管，但组装好的医生不得不等待，因为麻醉医师都忙着在ICU中为另外四名患者插管，在急诊室中为另外几名患者插管。</p><p>  None of the people I spoke with would predict when UNMC will finally hit its capacity ceiling, partly because they’re doing everything to avoid that scenario, and partly because it’s so grim as to be almost unthinkable. But “we’re rapidly approaching that point,” Hewlett said.</p><p>我与之交谈的人都无法预测联MC何时会达到其容量上限，部分是因为他们正在尽一切努力避免这种情况，部分是因为它是如此严峻以至于几乎无法想象。惠普说：“但是，我们正在迅速接近这一点。”</p><p> When it arrives, people with COVID-19 will die not just because of the virus, but because the hospital will have nowhere to put them and no one to help them. Doctors will have to decide who to put on a ventilator or a dialysis machine. They’ll have to choose whether to abandon entire groups of patients who can’t get help elsewhere. While cities like New York and Boston have many big hospitals that can care for advanced strokes, failing hearts that need mechanical support, and transplanted organs, “in this region, we’re it,” Johnson says. “We provide care that can’t be provided at any other hospital for a 200-mile radius. We’re going to need to decide if we continue to offer that care, or if we admit every single COVID-19 patient who comes through our door.”</p><p> 当它到达时，死于COVID-19的人不仅会死于病毒，还因为医院将无处可放，也没有人来帮助他们。医生将不得不决定谁戴上呼吸机或透析机。他们必须选择是否要放弃无法在其他地方获得帮助的全部患者。约翰逊说，尽管纽约和波士顿等城市拥有许多大型医院，可以治疗晚期卒中，需要机械支持的心脏衰竭和器官移植，但“在这个地区，我们做到了。” “我们提供半径200英里范围内其他任何医院都无法提供的护理。我们将需要决定是否继续提供这种护理，或者我们是否允许每位进入我们门的COVID-19患者。”</p><p>   During the spring, most of UNMC’s COVID-19 patients were either elderly people from nursing homes or workers in meatpacking plants and factories. But with the third national surge, “all the trends have gone out the window,” Sarah Swistak, a staff nurse, told me. “From the 90-year-old with every comorbidity listed to the 30-year-old who is the picture of perfect health, they’re all requiring oxygen because they’re so short of breath.”</p><p>   在春季，UNMC的大多数COVID-19患者要么是疗养院的老人，要么是肉类包装厂和工厂的工人。但是随着全国第三次激增，“所有趋势都消失了，”一名护士护士莎拉·斯维斯塔克（Sarah Swistak）告诉我。 “从列出所有合并症的90岁到表现出完美健康的30岁，他们都需要氧气，因为它们呼吸急促。”</p><p> This lack of pattern is a pattern in itself, and suggests that there’s no single explanation for the current surge. Nebraska reopened too early, “when we didn’t have enough control, and in the absence of a mask mandate,” Cawcutt says. Pandemic fatigue set in. Weddings that were postponed from the spring took place in the fall. Customers packed into indoor spaces, like bars and restaurants, where the virus most easily finds new hosts. Colleges resumed in-person classes. UNMC is struggling not because of any one super-spreading event, but because of the cumulative toll of millions of bad decisions.</p><p> 缺乏模式本身就是一种模式，这表明对当前的激增没有单一的解释。内布拉斯加州重新开放为时过早，“当我们没有足够的控制权且没有掩盖任务时，”考夫特特说。大流行性疲劳开始。春季推迟的婚礼在秋天举行。顾客挤进酒吧和饭店等室内空间，病毒最容易找到新的宿主。大学恢复了面对面的课堂。联MC努力的原因不是因为任何一个超级传播事件，而是因为数百万个错误决定的累积损失。</p><p>  When the hospital first faced the pandemic in the spring, “I was buoyed by the realization that everyone in America was doing their part to slow down the spread,”  Johnson says. “Now I know friends of mine are going about their normal lives, having parties and dinners, and playing sports indoors. It’s very difficult to do this work when we know so many people are not doing their part.” The drive home from the packed hospital takes him past rows of packed restaurants, sporting venues, and parking lots.</p><p>  约翰逊说，当医院在春季第一次面对大流行时，“我意识到美国的每个人都在尽自己的力量来减缓传播，这使我感到振奋。” “现在，我知道我的朋友们会过着正常的生活，参加聚会和晚餐，并在室内运动。当我们知道很多人没有尽自己的一份力量时，完成这项工作非常困难。”从拥挤的医院开车回家，带他经过一排排拥挤的餐馆，运动场和停车场。</p><p> To a degree, Johnson sympathizes. “I don’t think people in Omaha thought we could ever have something that resembles New York,” he told me. “To be honest, in the spring, I would have thought it extremely unlikely.” But he adds that the Midwest has taken entirely the wrong lesson from the Northeast’s ordeal. Instead of learning that the pandemic is controllable, and that physical distancing works, people instead internalized “a mistaken belief that every curve that goes up must come down,” he said. “What they don’t realize is that if we don’t change anything about how we’re conducting ourselves, the curve can go up and up.”</p><p>约翰逊在某种程度上同情。他告诉我：“我认为奥马哈地区的人们认为我们永远不可能拥有类似于纽约的东西。” “说实话，在春天，我本以为极不可能。”但他补充说，中西部从东北的苦难中吸取了完全错误的教训。他说，人们没有意识到这种流行病是可以控制的，而且物理距离有效，而是内部化了“错误的看法，认为上升的每条曲线都必须下降”。 “他们没有意识到的是，如果我们不改变自己的行为方式，那曲线就会上升。”</p><p>  Speaking on Tuesday afternoon, Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts once again  refused to issue a statewide mask mandate. He promised to tighten restrictions once a quarter of the state’s beds are filled with COVID-19 patients,  but even then, some restaurants will still offer indoor dining; gyms and churches will remain open; and groups of 10 people will still be able to gather in enclosed spaces. Ricketts urged Nebraskans to avoid close contact, confined areas, and crowds, but his policies nullify his pleas. “People have the mistaken belief that if the government allows them to do something, it is safe to do,” Johnson said.</p><p>  内布拉斯加州州长皮特·里基茨（Pete Ricketts）在星期二下午发表讲话时，再次拒绝发布全州面具指令。他承诺，一旦该州四分之一的床位装有COVID-19患者，就将加强限制，但即便如此，一些餐馆仍将提供室内用餐服务。体育馆和教堂将保持开放；而每10人一组仍将能够聚集在封闭的空间中。里基茨敦促内布拉斯加人避免亲密接触，禁区和人群，但他的政策使他的恳求无效。约翰逊说：“人们错误地认为，如果政府允许他们做某事，那是安全的。”</p><p>  There are signs that citizens and businesses are acting ahead of policy makers. Some restaurants are ceasing indoor dining even without a prohibition. Parents are pulling their children out of schools and sports leagues. “I have heard from more friends and family about COVID-19 in the last two weeks than I have in the previous six months, expressing support and a change in attitudes,” Johnson said.</p><p>  有迹象表明，公民和企业在决策者之前采取行动。一些餐馆甚至没有禁止也停止室内用餐。父母将孩子带出学校和体育联赛。约翰逊说：“与前六个月相比，过去两周我收到了更多的朋友和家人的有关COVID-19的消息，表达了支持和态度的转变。”</p><p>  But COVID-19 works slowly. It takes several days for infected people to show symptoms, a dozen more for newly diagnosed cases to wend their way to hospitals, and even more  for the sickest of patients to die. These lags mean that the pandemic’s near-term future is always set, baked in by the choices of the past. It means that Ricketts is already too late to stop whatever UNMC will face in the coming weeks (but not too late to spare the hospital further grief next month). It means that some of the people who get infected over Thanksgiving will struggle to enter packed hospitals by the middle of December, and be in the ground by Christmas.</p><p>  但是COVID-19的运行速度很慢。感染者需要几天的时间才能表现出症状，新诊断的病例要花更多的时间才能进入医院，甚至最病的患者也要死亡。这些滞后意味着大流行的近期未来总是会被过去的选择所确定。这意味着里基茨已经太迟了，无法制止联合国军方在未来几周内将要面对的一切（但为时不晚，以免下个月医院进一步遭受痛苦）。这意味着，一些在感恩节期间被感染的人将难以在12月中旬进入挤满人的医院，并在圣诞节之前进入地面。</p><p>  Officially, Nebraska  has 4,223 hospital beds, of which 1,165—27 percent—are still available. But that figure is deceptive. It includes beds for labor and deliveries, as well as pediatric beds that cannot be repurposed. It also says nothing about how stretched hospitals have already become in their efforts to create capacity. UNMC has postponed  elective surgeries—those which could be deferred for four to 12 weeks. Patients with strokes and other urgent traumas aren’t getting the normal level of attention, because the pandemic is so all-consuming. Clinical research has stopped because research nurses are now COVID-19 nurses. The hospital is forced to turn down many requests to take in patients from rural hospitals and neighboring states that are themselves almost out of beds.</p><p>  内布拉斯加州正式拥有4,223张病床，其中1,165张（占27％）仍然可用。但是这个数字具有欺骗性。它包括用于分娩和分娩的床，以及不能重新使用的儿科床。它也没有说医院在努力建立能力方面已经变得多么紧张。联MC推迟了选修手术，这些手术可能会推迟4至12周。中风和其他紧急创伤的患者没有得到正常的关注，因为这种流行病非常耗费精力。临床研究已经停止，因为研究护士现在是COVID-19护士。医院被迫拒绝许多乡村医院和周边州的病人的请求，这些病人本身几乎没有病床。</p><p>  Empty hospital beds might as well be hotel beds without doctors and nurses to staff them. And though health-care workers are resilient, “many of us feel like we haven’t had a day off since this thing began,” Hewlett says. The current surge is pushing them to the limit because people with COVID-19 are far sicker than the average patient. In an ICU, they need twice as much attention for three times the usual stay. To care for them, UNMC’s nurses and respiratory therapists are now doing mandatory overtime. The hospital has tried to hire travel nurses, but with the entire country calling for help, the pool of reinforcements is dry. “Even before COVID-19 hit, we were short-staffed,” says Becky Long, a lead nurse on a COVID ICU floor. Of late, there have been days when the hospital had 45 to 60 fewer nurses than it needed. “Every time I’ve been at work, I’ve thought:  This is going to be the final straw. But somehow we continue to make it work, and I truly have no idea how.”</p><p>空的医院病床也可能是没有医生和护士为其配备人员的旅馆病床。惠普表示，尽管医护人员具有韧性，但“自从这件事开始以来，我们很多人都没有休息一天。”当前的浪潮将他们推向了极限，因为COVID-19的患者比普通患者的病重得多。在ICU中，他们需要三倍于通常停留时间的注意力。为了照顾他们，UNMC的护士和呼吸治疗师正在加班加班。医院曾试图雇用旅行护士，但由于整个国家都在寻求帮助，因此援救队伍已经干dry了。 “即使在COVID-19发生之前，我们的人手也很短，” COVID ICU地板上的首席护士贝基·朗（Becky Long）说。最近，有几天医院的护士人数少于所需数量。 “每次上班时，我都在想：这将是最后一根稻草。但是我们仍然以某种方式继续使它起作用，而我确实不知道如何实现。”</p><p>  Before COVID-19, Long worked in oncology. Death is no stranger to her, but she tells me she can barely comprehend the amount she has seen in recent weeks. “I used to be able to leave work at work, but with the pandemic, it follows me everywhere I go,” she said. “It’s all I see when I come home, when I look at my kids.”</p><p>  在COVID-19之前，Long从事肿瘤学研究。死亡对她并不陌生，但她告诉我，她几乎无法理解她最近几周所见到的数字。她说：“我曾经能够离开工作岗位，但由于大流行，到处都是我。” “回家后，当我看着孩子时，我所看到的就是这些。”</p><p> Long and other nurses have told many families that they can’t see their dying loved ones, and then sat with those patients so they didn’t have to die alone. Lindsay Ivener, a staff nurse, told me that COVID-19 had recently killed an elderly woman whom she was caring for, the woman’s husband, and one of her grandchildren. A second grandchild had just been admitted to the hospital with COVID-19. “It just tore this whole family apart in a month,” Ivener said. “I couldn’t even cry. I didn’t have the energy.”</p><p> 龙和其他护士告诉许多家庭，他们看不到垂死的亲人，然后与这些患者坐在一起，这样他们就不必一个人死了。一名护士Lindsay Ivener告诉我，COVID-19最近杀害了一名她正在照料的老年妇女，该妇女的丈夫和她的孙子之一。第二个孙子刚以COVID-19入院。艾文纳说：“这只是一个月内将整个家庭撕裂了。” “我什至无法哭泣。我没有精力。”</p><p> Until recently, Ivener worked in corporate America as a retail buyer and inventory manager. Wanting to help people, she retrained as a nurse and graduated this May. “I’ve only worked as a nurse during a pandemic,” she told me. “It’s got to get better, right?”</p><p> 直到最近，Ivener还在美国公司担任零售采购员和库存经理。为了帮助人们，她接受了护士培训，并于今年5月毕业。她告诉我：“我只是在大流行期间担任护士，” “它必须变得更好，对吧？”</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/11/americas-best-prepared-hospital-nearly-overwhelmed/617156/">https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/11/americas-best-prepared-hospital-nearly-overwhelmed/617156/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/医院/">#医院</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/hospitals/">#hospitals</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
