The craft, an electric vertical takeoff multicopter (abbreviated eVTOL for  electric  vertical  take  off and  landing) was remotely controlled and the test flights took place under the supervision of Australia\u2019s Civil Aviation Safety Authority.\n The ultimate goal for Airspeeder and Alauda Aeronautics (the former is the racing series, the latter is the manufacturer), both founded by entrepreneur Matthew Pearson, has been to build flying vehicles for the  purpose of racing them, which the companies say is the next step. According to Airspeeder\u2019s website, the \u201csuccessful execution of these flights means that uncrewed electric flying car Grand Prixs will take place in 2021 at three soon-to-be-revealed international locations.\u201d\n  According to  Airspeeder (pdf), the unpiloted Mk3 weighs 130 kilograms (about 286 pounds), can go from zero to 62 mph in 2.8 seconds, and climb to 500 meters. It has a removable battery, which its pit crews have been able to replace in under 20 seconds. It can fly for 10 to 15 minutes on one battery pack, the company says, and it\u2019s equipped with lidar and radar to create a \u201cvirtual forcefield\u201d to help prevent collisions.\n Airspeeder says its initial EXA Series races, which it\u2019s planning for later this year, will include up to four teams with two remote pilots per team.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 04:41:50", "source_domain":

", "note_en": "Docker Inc. started like many startups with engineers working from a single location. For us, this was in the Bay Area in the US. We were very office-centric, so the natural way to increase diversity and to get engineers from different cultures to work together was to open new offices in diverse locations. Right from the start, our goal was to mix American and European ways of producing software, giving us the best of both cultures.\n  In 2015, Docker started to open offices in Europe, starting with Cambridge in the United Kingdom and followed by Paris in France. With these two locations, the long road to gaining experience working with remote employees began.\n Having multiple offices scattered around the world is different from being fully remote. But you still start experiencing some of the challenges of not having everybody in the same location simultaneously. We spent a great deal of our time on planes or trains visiting each other.\n Despite the robust open-source culture of the company, which shows that you can build great software while not having everybody in the same room, we still had a very office-centric culture. A lot of the context of a given product conversation or decision was linked to a given office. When you were not in the office where the decision was made, you only had partial information about the decision.\n We learned a lot during this time: organizing work effectively and enjoyably while appreciating different cultures, time zones (France and US West Coast are 9 hours apart\u2026), paperwork, salary expectations, public holidays, etc.\n  The products Docker builds have a significant impact on the world, so hiring great engineers has never been a problem at Docker. We were artificially limiting ourselves to hiring talent close to one of our offices. We could open more offices or start hiring people as fully remote wherever they lived. In 2017, we hired a couple of very experienced remote engineers who had 5+ years of experience working remotely. They brought a lot of their best practices, and with them, the company learned how to be better at working with remote engineers.\n One of the areas we made changes was in how we ran meetings. Instead of only having remote employees dial in and struggling to follow conversations in conference rooms, we got everyone, even those in offices, to dial in with a good headset so that everyone was on the same level. This drastically improves the quality of meetings for those who are remote.\n We also learned the power of good writing as time zones forced communication to be more asynchronous. Concise, clear, and effective, writing became critical.\n We worked hard on our company core values, one of them is \u201cOpen Collaboration\u201d. Following that value, we started to close 1600+ slack channels to concentrate our communication around just a few dozen. We advocated for communication to happen in public slack channels by default and limiting the usage of private channels to only when necessary.\n Remote engineers felt better, but there was still a life in the office they couldn\u2019t grasp, this is when we introduced  Wormholes. Wormholes are pretty low-tech, they are a monitor, a camera, and speakers open in the offices all day. Remote engineers connect to it, have a view of the offices, and can feel the ambiance and hear general conversations. They can also slack someone to come close to the wormhole for \u201cdirect\u201d communication. They were pretty popular until we left our offices to start working from home.\n  In early 2020, once we were pretty experienced at remote working, we advocated for all positions to be open in any country that we had legal entities, making it easier for us to hire good talent.\n Then Covid hit us along with everyone else. Relatively confident in our experience of working remotely, we thought that we were more ready than others to have everyone working at home. We quickly realized that working remotely and working remotely through a pandemic are not the same at all.\n While we had the software and culture to embrace a remote-first workforce, the pandemic itself brought new challenges. Not being able to see each other in the office or family and relatives for such a long time has taken a toll on everybody. This also highlighted inequality that we didn\u2019t realize before: people with small apartments, young kids, or living alone were hit harder than those living with relatives and enjoying a large house.\n These hard-learned lessons fueled the way we shape the future of work at Docker. Giving employees help to set up their home office, helping them move from one city to another, and generally spending enough time and energy making sure everybody is comfortable as we transition to this exciting new future of work.\n  While other companies are pushing their employees to get back to offices, we decided that there is no turning back for Docker Inc. and that we will stay remote-first. All of our offices are closed and will remain so.

We wish you a long and healthy life. 100 years and more!\n You have probably seen the evolution of CPUs \u2013 from 16-bit to 32-bit CPUs and later from 32-bit to 64-bit CPUs. The logical question arises \u2013 when will 128-bit processors arrive?\n 128-bit CPU, when talking about computer architecture, means that this processor must have 128-bit integers and a 128-bit bus. It is not x2 better than 64-bit. It is not that simple at all.\n While in the past there was a need to address more memory, the current 64-bit CPUs can handle so much RAM that you can\u2019t even imagine. To be precise, the amount is 2^64 bytes or 18.44 exabytes. 1 exabyte is 1 billion gigabytes! You won\u2019t see this amount of RAM probably ever in your life. 4 Gb for a 32-bit system can be sufficient or 8 Gb for normal office work on a 64-bit OS would also work. Some cutting edge devices have 64 Gb or even 128 Gb, but this is required in very few situations like heavy CAT applications or video editing.\n We are currently using 64-bit processors, but usually, the bus is not 64 bits. More like 40-bit or 48-bit. This characteristic still has the possibility to improve.\n Going to a 128-bit CPU from a 64-bit one will require more memory. We will need a huge cache size. Otherwise, the program will just run slowlier.\n It will require a lot more power. Such a processor will be significantly bigger in size and it will release more heat too. This can be very impractical. Literally nobody wants bigger and heavier devices.\n The price per wat will also be too expensive. It will be far costlier to create a 128-bit CPU.\n Another disadvantage will be the need for a 128-bit OS and drivers. It will be pointless if such a processor can\u2019t be properly utilized. For now neither Microsoft nor Apple are even thinking of creating such an OS.\n One of the executives of ARM stated that the company \u201chas no plans for 128-bit ARM-based chips because they simply aren\u2019t needed.\u201d\n Surely one day, after many, many years we will start using 128-bits processors, but obviously, it won\u2019t be soon.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 04:30:02", "source_domain":

criteria for the adoption of the currency.\n Previous roadmap required that all member countries met three primary criteria for the adoption of the currency.\n That included member countries having a budget deficit of not more than 3 percent; average annual inflation of less than 10 percent with a long-term goal of not more than 5 percent.\n Countries were expected to also have gross reserves that can finance at least three months of imports.\n  The other convergence criteria that was adopted by ECOWAS was public debt or Gross Domestic Product of not more than 70 percent.\n There was also the issue of central banks financing budget deficit not more than 10 percent of previous year\u2019s tax revenue, and nominal exchange rate variation of plus or minus 10 percent.\n Majority of the member

", "note_en": "The city of Stockton, California, embarked on a bold experiment two years ago: It decided to distribute  $500 a month to 125 people for 24 months \u2014 with no strings attached and no work requirements. The people were randomly chosen from neighborhoods at or below the city\u2019s median household income, and they were free to spend the money any way they liked. Meanwhile, researchers studied what impact the cash had on their lives.\n The  results from the first year of the experiment, which spanned from February 2019 to February 2020, are now in. And they\u2019re extremely encouraging for its participants, and for advocates who see unconditional cash transfers as an effective way to help people escape poverty.\n The most eye-popping finding is that the people who received the cash managed to secure full-time jobs at more than twice the rate of people in a control group, who did not receive cash.  Within a year, the proportion of cash recipients who had full-time jobs jumped from 28 percent to 40 percent. The control group saw only a 5 percent jump over the same period.\n The researchers  wrote in their report that the money gave recipients the stability they needed to set goals, take risks, and find new jobs. One man in his 30s had been eligible for a real estate license for over a year but hadn\u2019t gotten it because he just couldn\u2019t afford to take time off work. Thanks to the freedom offered by the extra $500 per month, he said, his life was \u201cconverted 360 degrees \u2026 because I have more time and net worth to study \u2026 to achieve my goals.\u201d\n  Critics of cash assistance programs often  say that handing out \u201cfree money\u201d will make people less inclined to find jobs. But in the research done to date, unconditional cash does not tend to disincentivize work. In several programs \u2014 from Alaska and North Carolina in the US, to  Finland and Spain in Europe \u2014 it has had no effect on employment either way. In some cases, it seems to embolden people with an entrepreneurial bent; for instance, in Japan,  initial survey results have shown that recipients are 3.9 times more interested in launching a new business.\n Employment aside, there are clear benefits to unconditional cash programs. The Stockton experiment \u2014 which was conducted as a randomized controlled trial and underwent an independent evaluation \u2014 adds to the growing body of evidence from  basic income experiments around the world, which shows that getting unconditional cash tends to boost  happiness,  health,  school attendance, and  trust in social institutions, while  reducing crime.\n   There were other benefits from the Stockton program. Cash recipients reported being less anxious and depressed than the control group. On average, the recipients \u201cexperienced clinically and statistically significant improvements in their mental health that the control group did not \u2014 moving from likely having a mild mental health disorder to likely mental wellness over the year-long intervention,\u201d according to the researchers.\n The cash also  enabled recipients to help their family and friends. For example, one woman used the cash to help her siblings buy school clothes for their kids and to help her daughter-in-law pay for car insurance. Another bought diapers for her grandchildren.\n This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen cash programs have positive ripple effects on the broader community. In Kenya, cash transfers have stimulated the economy and   benefited not only the recipients themselves but also people in nearby villages.\n It\u2019s worth noting a wrinkle in the Stockton trial:  Each participant was given $500 per month on a debit card so that researchers would be able to see how they were using the money. However, 40 percent of it was either withdrawn as cash or transferred to an existing bank account, so researchers had to rely on participants to tell them where the money went.\n Of the money tracked on the debit cards, recipients spent most on necessities like food (37 percent), home goods and clothes (22 percent), utilities (11 percent), and car costs (10 percent). They spent less than 1 percent on alcohol or cigarettes.\n Though these numbers can\u2019t capture the full picture, they offer a counter to harmful stereotypes and faulty assumptions: that people who become poor get that way because they\u2019re bad at rational decision-making and self-control, and that they\u2019ll blow free money on frivolous things or addictive substances. The  evidence  does not support these beliefs.\n The Stockton experiment was a small study with only 125 cash recipients, so the findings should be seen as offering supporting evidence on the effectiveness of cash programs rather than as definitive standalone proof. Nevertheless,  the results of this philanthropically funded program \u2014 officially known as the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED), which received a $1 million grant from the Economic Security Project \u2014 help underscore that poverty is a lack of cash, not character, and usefully add to the body of evidence that free money doesn\u2019t disincentivize employment \u2014 it can actually boost it.\n   The message that free money can actually improve job prospects comes at a critical moment, as the  Biden administration tries to push through a pandemic aid package that would include direct checks to millions of Americans.\n The pandemic has made the idea of direct payments more popular. With the Covid-19 crisis generating so much financial loss and uncertainty, advocates have argued that citizens desperately need some sort of income floor. And against this backdrop, SEED has spawned something much bigger:  Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, a  coalition of mayors who are pushing for the US to implement a federal guaranteed income. Both SEED and the mayoral  coalition are the brainchild of Michael Tubbs, the former mayor of Stockton.\n For years now, Tubbs has promoted the idea that a guaranteed income could transform life for Stockton residents, but he\u2019s also made clear this experiment is about a lot more than just his city. \u201cStockton is a proxy for America: its diversity, its people,\u201d he  said. \u201cIt\u2019s a place that\u2019s emerging and has big, bold ideas.\u201d\n Guaranteed income is a big, bold idea that could improve life for millions of Americans if implemented more widely. That said, it\u2019s not a cure-all for the systemic obstacles that keep people from a healthy, stable life.\n As the SEED researchers wrote in their report, \u201cGuaranteed income should not be considered as a singular approach for household stability, but rather as one policy option to be implemented alongside others to shore up market failures.\u201d Other policy options include increasing the supply of affordable housing and raising the minimum wage.\n For now, only the first year\u2019s worth of data from the Stockton experiment is available; we have to wait until 2022 for the full results. But the first-year findings signal that guaranteed income programs \u2014 combined with better public policy \u2014 could go a long way toward fighting poverty.\n   Millions turn to Vox to understand what\u2019s happening in the news.
