"note_en": "For years, I&#39;ve been maintaining  benchmarks for microSD cards on the Raspberry Pi, but I only spent a little time testing external USB storage, due to historic limitations with the Pi&#39;s USB 2.0 bus.\n But the Pi 4 cleared away the limitations with a full-speed USB 3.0 bus offering much better performance, so I&#39;ve done a lot of testing with USB boot, and with all the USB SSDs I had at my disposal. You can see some of those results in this  blog post and video on booting a Pi 4 via USB.\n After posting my tests concerning  UASP support in USB SATA adapters, I got an email from Rob Logan mentioning the performance of some other types of drives he had with him. And he even offered to ship a few drives to me for comparisons!\n   So I took Rob up on the offer, and he sent me an XPG NVMe drive in a TDBT enclosure and an Arcanite AK58 USB 3.1 flash drive, touted by some as &#39;one of the fastest USB flash drives available&#39;. I added a couple other drives to the test, pictured below:\n    I ran benchmarks on every one of these drives, testing their sequential read and write performance with  hdparm and  dd (to test large file operations), as well as their random 4K read and write performance with  iozone (to test more general usage patterns when booting or running apps on a Pi).\n  So how did all these drives perform? I ran all the tests booting the Pi from the device that was being tested, and I also ran the same benchmarks on my fastest microSD card, a Samsung Evo Plus.\n   The sequential results show a huge gap between the SSDs and fast new USB flash drives and the cheaper older-generation flash drives and the microSD card.\n From what I&#39;ve found, it seems like most USB flash drives perform the same as a microSD card in a USB adapter:\n  The Arcanite does well here, but it does lag a little bit behind the SSDs and even the Corsair GTX.\n   Random IO performance paints a more complex picture. The performance of the older flash drives remains abysmal, with even the microSD card  trouncing them in random 4K write performance.\n But the Arcanite also falls off quite a bit in comparison to the SSDs and the Corsair. And the XPG NMVe drive is at least twice as fast as every other option when it comes to random write performance.\n So overall, it looks like a decent quality NVMe drive and USB enclosure is going to give the best overall performance. And the Corsair GTX is by far the fastest USB flash drive I&#39;ve ever tested.\n But there&#39;s one other test I wanted to do before closing the book on performance, and that&#39;s a 10 GB file copy over the network.\n This test doesn&#39;t sustain the maximum sequential throughput for the drive, but it does take a long time and tests how well the different devices handle heat from constant write activity.\n   This shows some interesting results. The Arcanite and the SanDisk Ultra Fit perform much worse for long-duration file copies than all the rest.\n The Arcanite was only a tiny bit slower than the SSDs and the Corsair in the quick sequential tests, and the Ultra Fit was actually slightly faster than the Ultra Flair.\n   Well, I pulled out my Seek thermal camera and took a reading on the Ultra Fit:\n  I put some thermal tape on the tiny bit of metal that was exposed when it&#39;s plugged in, and the temperature measured over 60\u00b0C (140\u00b0F)!\n The Arcanite&#39;s plastic body didn&#39;t measure quite so hot, but that&#39;s just the problem\u2014plastic is a good thermal insulator, and that&#39;s why you often see it used in coolers. Metal, on the other hand, is good at dispersing heat, but you have to have enough area for the metal to disperse the heat, or the drive is going to get really hot.\n The Arcanite&#39;s plastic body traps the heat inside, which leads to overheating, while the Ultra Fit&#39;s tiny profile doesn&#39;t leave enough room to dissipate heat.\n Compare that to the much beefier Corsair GTX, which is larger (lots more surface area) and made of solid metal. Even under heavy write load, the Corsair kept its cool at 36\u00b0C (&lt;100\u00b0F):\n  When you look at the benchmarks on the packaging, or even benchmarks posted to Amazon reviews from CrystalDiskMark, remember most of them don&#39;t reflect the  true performance of these drives tested under real-world conditions.\n SSDs and NVMe drives typically have a lot more surface area for heat dispersion, so they tend to perform more consistently since they can avoid overheating issues.\n Most USB flash drives are designed more for compactness and convenience, and performance with general computing tasks or over long periods of time is usually more of an afterthought.\n Usually, that is, unless we&#39;re talking about the Corsair\u2014it&#39;s the first USB flash drive I&#39;ve tested that compares favorably to USB SSDs!\n   What drive gives the most value? After all, the Corsair is $55, while the cheapest option, the SanDisk USB Fit, is about $7. When you go to buy a USB drive for your Pi, you want the best overall value, and you might want to sacrifice a little performance for a lot in savings!\n So comparing all these drives (using the price for the 128 GB version), I came up with these two graphs:\n  This graph compares how many dollars you have to spend per MB/sec on a large file copy. The Arcanite gives the best bang for your buck (assuming you&#39;re not constantly writing to it all day), with double the value of the SSDs or the Corsair GTX. The Kingston SSD comes in second... while the microSD and older SanDisk flash drives are a pretty poor choice when it comes to value for sequential access.\n  In this graph, showing value for random IO activity, the microSD card fares much better, but the older SanDisk flash drives are still a terrible value.\n But the XPG NVMe (with an enclosure) becomes the best value, with the Kingston SSD and Corsair GTX in close pursuit. The Arcanite is a bit of a laggard, but it&#39;s still respectable with performance similar to the microSD drive.\n  What do these values mean? Should you get the XPG drive or the Corsair for the best raw performance? Or should you stick with the Arcanite, which gives the best bang for the buck for sequential performance (in some conditions)?\n Well, that&#39;s impossible for me to answer. If you&#39;re going to store large files on the drive, and use it as a media server or NAS, then an Arcanite might be the best option. If you want to run applications or use the Pi as a desktop, the NVMe and an enclosure is probably the best option.\n Or, if you want the most portable Pi possible, using the least amount of space and energy, you might be willing to sacrifice a little more performance and stick with a reliable microSD card.\n Or if you need even more performance, you might want to look at a different single board computer that offers built-in SATA or NVMe support.\n In the end, it&#39;s really up to how you want to use your Raspberry Pi, I just hope this helps make your decision a little easier.\n  I put all the raw performance data and benchmarks used in  this issue on the Raspberry Pi Dramble issue tracker.\n Also, Rob sent me many more results for other drives he tested, and was generous enough to allow me to share some of those results. They are summarized in the table below:\n  And he sent over a few pictures of some of the drives he tested, one of which I&#39;ll share here, for your reference:", "posttime": "2020-08-07 07:20:17",

But you\u2019re still staring at the ceiling in the small hours. Here\u2019s why\n   Y ou land in your body with a start, or else it slowly comes into groggy focus: either way it\u2019s night-time, but you are now awake. Why? Alice Gregory, a psychology professor at Goldsmiths, University of London and the author of  Nodding Off, says it\u2019s quite normal to wake up during the night.\n After dropping off, we move through different stages of sleep, a cycle that takes the average adult about 90 minutes to complete and speeds up towards morning.\n  \u201cThe night is also punctuated by brief awakenings,\u201d says Gregory. \u201cTypically, people return to sleep without realising that they had ever been awake.\u201d But sometimes we might at least be more aware of it, or pulled entirely awake. Reasons range from the fairly obvious (being too hot or cold, needing the loo, having a nightmare, a crying baby) to the medical (disordered breathing such as sleep apnoea, or nocturia: excessive night-time urination).\n Waking up during the night does not necessarily mean you have insomnia, which, says Gregory, is diagnosed alongside other criteria such as the frequency of this occurrence and how long it has been happening. \u201cIf you find yourself waking regularly during the night, certainly flag this with your GP so they can consider any possible underlying causes.\u201d\n Still, sleep deprivation takes its own toll, from irritability and reduced focus in the short term, to an increased risk of obesity, heart disease and diabetes. If you do find yourself regularly waking up without any apparent reason \u2013 what can you do about it?\n \u201cIt\u2019s a misconception that we sleep the night through \u2013 nobody ever does,\u201d says  the sleep coach Katie Fischer. Waking as much as five or seven times a night is not necessarily a cause for concern \u2013 the most important thing is how you feel when you get up. \u201cIn the morning, do you feel refreshed, or groggy and unable to function, 30 minutes after waking?\u201d\n If there is nothing to suggest an underlying medical issue, Fischer will look at the bigger picture with a patient. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to know if they have children. Do they have a partner who snores, or works shifts?\u201d she says. \u201cThey might not have their own sleep issues but they might be sleeping next to someone who does.\u201d\n Lifestyle changes can make a big difference, even for people suffering from sleep apnoea (although that should be treated by a specialist). It is hackneyed to point the finger at caffeine, but people tend to underestimate how long its effects can last \u2013 Fischer says to stop consuming it by 2pm or 3pm. Water intake during the day is also a factor: \u201cEven going to bed mildly dehydrated can disrupt our sleep.\u201d\n Similarly, although people commonly turn to alcohol to help them fall asleep \u2013 Fischer says one in 10 use it as a sleep aid \u2013 it has a disruptive effect beyond the initial crash, causing spikes in blood sugar and cortisol levels. Diet can function in the same way, with \u201canti-sleep foods\u201d that are high in sugar or cause flatulence or heartburn (such as broccoli and cabbage).\n  A \u201cpro-sleep\u201d bedtime snack is a small amount of complex carbohydrates and protein, such as wholegrain cereal with milk, or toast with peanut butter, says Fischer. An \u201canti-inflammatory\u201d diet favouring fruits, vegetables, lean protein, nuts, seeds and healthy fats (and limiting processed foods, red meats and alcohol) has been shown to improve sleep apnoea.\n As for exercise, although being active during the day aids sleep, anything strenuous is to be avoided before bedtime. A lot of advice for preventing night-time \u201cawakenings\u201d falls under the umbrella of what has come to be known as \u201cgood sleep hygiene\u201d: restrict the bedroom to sleep and sex, ban screens emitting blue light, keep to regular bedtimes and so on.\n Our bedrooms \u2013 even our beds \u2013 have come to double as home cinemas, offices, \u201ca dining room, maybe,\u201d says  the sleep consultant Maryanne Taylor. \u201cYou would be amazed at how significant that is for sleep. You\u2019re training to associate your bed with wakefulness.\u201d For that reason, if you do struggle to fall back asleep on waking up during the night, the advice is to get up for a bit. \u201cDon\u2019t just lie there \u2013 it\u2019s counterproductive.\u201d\n So, too, is looking at the clock, especially if it doubles as your phone. \u201cAs soon as your brain has registered that it\u2019s 2am, you convince yourself that that\u2019s your lot,\u201d says Taylor. Such worry loops might be waking you up in the first place.\n For many of us, bedtime might be our first opportunity of the day to be alone with our thoughts, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s connected to waking in the night because, if we haven\u2019t had any processing time during the day, it\u2019s the first time we stop and just be.\u201d Managing stress and anxiety during waking hours and learning how to relax body and mind are key to a good night\u2019s sleep \u2013 but ironically, fixating on getting your full eight hours can make it harder to achieve. \u201cYou get this awful self-fulfilling prophecy that\u2019s quite hard to break,\u201d says Fischer.\n A mindset change may be what\u2019s needed. \u201cPeople might have this belief that they are a \u2018bad sleeper\u2019 and there is nothing that they can do about it. Sometimes it\u2019s about changing people\u2019s perceptions of what good sleep looks like.\u201d Taylor says she \u201creally cannot bear\u201d fitness trackers, which monitor sleep, for focusing people\u2019s minds on often inaccurate data. It is wrong to assume that you must sleep through the night, every night, she says. \u201cWe all have blips in our sleep \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be that you sleep brilliantly all the time.\u201d\n But accepting that \u2013 even as you lie awake, hours before dawn \u2013 might be the first step towards it.", "posttime": "2020-08-07 07:14:15", "source_domain":

devices.\n Specifically, the vulnerability could have exposed the private data of Twitter users running devices with Android OS versions 8 and 9, the company said.\n  &#34;This vulnerability could allow an attacker, through a malicious app installed on your device, to access private Twitter data on your device (like Direct Messages) by working around Android system permissions that protect against this,&#34; the company said  in a blog post.\n The new vulnerability comes just weeks after 130 of Twitter&#39;s most notable users, including Elon Musk, Joe Biden and Bill Gates, had their accounts taken over by hackers as part of  a bitcoin scam. Earlier this week, Twitter also disclosed that it expects to  pay as much as $250 million to the Federal Trade Commission\u00a0for using personal information users provided for security purposes to target advertising instead.\n The company said there is no evidence that the Android vulnerability has been exploited by attackers. Regardless, Twitter said it has begun informing users who could have been vulnerable. The company has also updated its Android app to remove the vulnerability, and it is requiring anyone who may have been impacted to update their Twitter for Android app. Twitter said it is also identifying changes to its processes to better guard against issues like this.\n &#34;Your privacy and trust is important to us and we will continue working to keep your data secure on Twitter,&#34;

"note_en": "Cloud gaming is shaping up to have a big moment on mobile starting next month with the  launch of Microsoft\u2019s xCloud service, but iOS users are getting left out. And now we know exactly why: Apple won\u2019t allow those products, because of strict App Store guidelines that make cloud services like xCloud and its competitor, Google Stadia, effectively impossible to operate on the iPhone.\n We already knew that there was some issue, likely App Store-related, as to why Stadia wasn\u2019t available for Apple devices and why Microsoft\u2019s service would likely face a similar fate. It seemed even more likely that xCloud\u2019s fate on iOS was sealed yesterday when Microsoft  cut off iOS testing for its xCloud app well ahead of its September 15th launch date on Android. Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now service is also similarly Android-only when it comes to phones, even though that platform technically lets you access titles you already own.\n But Apple has finally come out and said, in a  statement to  Business Insider, that these kinds of cloud services are in violation of App Store guidelines and cannot, in their current forms, ever exist on iOS. The primary reason: they offer access to apps Apple can\u2019t individually review.\n  The App Store was created to be a safe and trusted place for customers to discover and download apps, and a great business opportunity for all developers. Before they go on our store, all apps are reviewed against the same set of guidelines that are intended to protect customers and provide a fair and level playing field to developers.\n Our customers enjoy great apps and games from millions of developers, and gaming services can absolutely launch on the App Store as long as they follow the same set of guidelines applicable to all developers, including submitting games individually for review, and appearing in charts and search. In addition to the App Store, developers can choose to reach all iPhone and iPad users over the web through Safari and other browsers on the App Store.\n Back in March,   Bloomberg reported Apple offering a very similar justification when questioned about potential antitrust issues related to Apple\u2019s Arcade game subscription service, which the company operates despite the headaches its competitors have doing the same.\n   Regardless, the key bit in that statement is \u201cincluding submitting games individually for review, and appearing in charts and search.\u201d The way Stadia works today, and the way xCloud will work next month, is that you pay for access to the service itself, and that service then allows you to pay for or access free games from the cloud. Those games are not stored on a local device in your home, unlike the Apple-approved Valve Steam Link app (although Valve  had its own set of troubles getting Steam Link approved on iOS).\n So Apple doesn\u2019t know what you\u2019re buying or playing on its devices because it can\u2019t review them beforehand. It also doesn\u2019t see any revenue from these services if they\u2019re simply allowing you to access a subscription service you already pay for, which was the crux of a  big showdown between Apple and Basecamp, the creator of new email service Hey, last month, which resolved only when Basecamp compromised with the iPhone maker by adding a free signup option to its iOS app.\n Apple is pretty explicit about all of this in the App Store guidelines, specifically section 4.2.7:\n 4.2.7 Remote Desktop Clients: If your remote desktop app acts as a mirror of specific software or services rather than a generic mirror of the host device, it must comply with the following:\n (a) The app must only connect to a user-owned host device that is a personal computer or dedicated game console owned by the user, and both the host device and client must be connected on a local and LAN-based network.\n (b) Any software or services appearing in the client are fully executed on the host device, rendered on the screen of the host device, and may not use APIs or platform features beyond what is required to stream the Remote Desktop.\n  (d) The UI appearing on the client does not resemble an iOS or App Store view, does not provide a store-like interface, or include the ability to browse, select, or purchase software not already owned or licensed by the user. For the sake of clarity, transactions taking place within mirrored software do not need to use in-app purchase, provided the transactions are processed on the host device.\n In other words, unless it\u2019s a full remote desktop app, a cloud gaming service is not allowed as these guidelines are written today \u2014 even though very narrowly tailored LAN services like Steam Link and Sony\u2019s PS4 Remote Play are.\n  Google and Microsoft probably don\u2019t want to offer signup options within the apps themselves because that would mean giving Apple a 30 percent cut of subscription revenue, but apps without \u201caccount creation\u201d options violate section (c). Abiding by section (a) is also impossible considering these cloud servers on which the games are running are not owned by and located in the homes of consumers, but placed in data centers far away. And section (e) just flat out says this type of thing \u2014 a \u201cthin client for cloud-based app\u201d \u2014 can\u2019t exist in the App Store at all; it\u2019s not \u201cappropriate,\u201d Apple says.\n There are some workarounds here. For instance, the Shadow cloud gaming service gives you access to a remote computer \u201chost device\u201d that is not technically owned by the user, but rented from the company itself. It\u2019s also not on the same network as the device that\u2019s accessing it. Yet Shadow works, and it\u2019s available on iOS today.\n A Shadow spokesperson tells  The Verge that, when it found its iOS app was in dispute with Apple earlier this year, it removed the quick launch feature that let users boot right into games. It was then approved, because the app functioned more like a remote desktop service \u2014 the \u201cgeneric mirror of the host device\u201d that Apple mentions as an exception in its App Store guidelines. With Shadow, you still have to go and install Steam, login, and access your existing titles just as you would on any other remote desktop app. But the device users remote into is a gaming PC that Shadow rents to you on a monthly basis, which is a clever way around these restrictions.\n iOS users will miss out n the mobile-centric cloud gaming wave that\u2019s set to arrive with xCloud\n Valve did something similar with Steam Link by removing the option to purchase games from the iOS version of the app, as Apple took issue with the fact that Steam Link effectively acted as an app store within the App Store that circumvented Apple\u2019s review processes.\n What does all this mean? Well, for now, iOS users are going to be missing out on the mobile-centric cloud gaming wave that\u2019s set to arrive with xCloud\u2019s launch. There is conceivably a way Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia could find ways around this by changing the core functionality of their respective apps.\n But it seems unlikely in the short term. The App Store is a massive market so lucrative developers have for years jumped through hoop after hoop to  access its nearly 1.5 billion users. In this case, however, there is a fundamental disconnect between how these services operate and the way Apple wants software to function on the iPhone and iPad. That doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going to change any time soon.", "posttime": "2020-08-07 06:48:14", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

"note_en": "Researchers from Nanyang Technical University, University of Washington, and University of British Columbia published a new paper in the  Journal of Marketing that examines &#34;unfair&#34; negative reviews and demonstrates that they can have positive consequences for the reviewed firm.    The study, forthcoming in the  Journal of Marketing, is titled &#34;Negative Reviews, Positive Impact: Consumer Empathetic Responding to Unfair Word-of-Mouth&#34; and is authored by Thomas Allard, Lea Dunn, and Katherine White.\n  Negative online reviews are abundant. Negative reviews generally provide diagnostic information about the inferior performance of the firm, which helps   make better decisions about their purchases. Those negative reviews usually lead to adverse consumer reactions such as decreased purchase or customer dislike for the brand. However, not all negative reviews are built from the same cloth. In some instances, the intensity of the negative reviews is not justified given the actions of the firm. These &#34;unfair&#34; negative reviews can have positive consequences for the reviewed firm.\n  Using six studies and four supplemental experiments (studying over 3,000 consumers), the research team provides converging evidence that unfairness in negative reviews evokes empathy for the firm from third-party consumers reading the reviews. This empathy is associated with increased purchase and patronage intentions. A study on the content of one thousand 1\u2014and 2- star hotel reviews from Trip Advisor finds that more than a quarter of these negative reviews contained elements that were perceived to be unfair, offering preliminary evidence about the prevalence of &#34;unfair&#34; negative reviews.\n  Allard explains that &#34;Our findings suggest that unfair negative reviews consistently result in more favorable responses to the reviewed firm than fair negative reviews and, at times, even better than positive reviews. We highlight the role of empathy for the firm as a motivator for increased favorable firm intentions. We also identify how firms can leverage empathy from consumers reading reviews, even for those reviews that do not naturally evoke empathy.&#34; The first suggestion is to respond to all reviews in a manner that is more personable in visual appearance and tone (e.g., show your employees, use first names, respond from a person instead of a &#34;brand&#34;). The second suggestion is to spotlight the employees involved in the creation of the product or service (e.g., employee profiles, &#34;meet your barista,&#34; naming the employee who helped make the product).\n  &#34;Overall, our research highlights that unfair   are not necessarily bad for the brand and that firms can learn to capitalize on these reviews&#34; says Dunn. By embracing the reviews, as some companies have done in the past (e.g., Ski Resorts, National Parks, Vienna Tourism all turned ridiculous 1-star reviews into something positive in their  ), firms can strategically leverage consumer   and benefit from potential downstream consequences.

"note_en": "Cloud gaming is shaping up to have a big moment on mobile starting next month with the  launch of Microsoft\u2019s xCloud service, but iOS users are getting left out. And now we know exactly why: Apple won\u2019t allow those products, because of strict App Store guidelines that make cloud services like xCloud and its competitor, Google Stadia, effectively impossible to operate on the iPhone.\n We already knew that there was some issue, likely App Store-related, as to why Stadia wasn\u2019t available for Apple devices and why Microsoft\u2019s service would likely face a similar fate. It seemed even more likely that xCloud\u2019s fate on iOS was sealed yesterday when Microsoft  cut off iOS testing for its xCloud app well ahead of its September 15th launch date on Android. Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now service is also similarly Android-only when it comes to phones, even though that platform technically lets you access titles you already own.\n But Apple has finally come out and said, in a  statement to  Business Insider, that these kinds of cloud services are in violation of App Store guidelines and cannot, in their current forms, ever exist on iOS. The primary reason: they offer access to apps Apple can\u2019t individually review.\n  The App Store was created to be a safe and trusted place for customers to discover and download apps, and a great business opportunity for all developers. Before they go on our store, all apps are reviewed against the same set of guidelines that are intended to protect customers and provide a fair and level playing field to developers.\n Our customers enjoy great apps and games from millions of developers, and gaming services can absolutely launch on the App Store as long as they follow the same set of guidelines applicable to all developers, including submitting games individually for review, and appearing in charts and search. In addition to the App Store, developers can choose to reach all iPhone and iPad users over the web through Safari and other browsers on the App Store.\n Back in March,   Bloomberg reported Apple offering a very similar justification when questioned about potential antitrust issues related to Apple\u2019s Arcade game subscription service, which the company operates despite the headaches its competitors have doing the same.\n   Regardless, the key bit in that statement is \u201cincluding submitting games individually for review, and appearing in charts and search.\u201d The way Stadia works today, and the way xCloud will work next month, is that you pay for access to the service itself, and that service then allows you to pay for or access free games from the cloud. Those games are not stored on a local device in your home, unlike the Apple-approved Valve Steam Link app (although Valve  had its own set of troubles getting Steam Link approved on iOS).\n So Apple doesn\u2019t know what you\u2019re buying or playing on its devices because it can\u2019t review them beforehand. It also doesn\u2019t see any revenue from these services if they\u2019re simply allowing you to access a subscription service you already pay for, which was the crux of a  big showdown between Apple and Basecamp, the creator of new email service Hey, last month, which resolved only when Basecamp compromised with the iPhone maker by adding a free signup option to its iOS app.\n Apple is pretty explicit about all of this in the App Store guidelines, specifically section 4.2.7:\n 4.2.7 Remote Desktop Clients: If your remote desktop app acts as a mirror of specific software or services rather than a generic mirror of the host device, it must comply with the following:\n (a) The app must only connect to a user-owned host device that is a personal computer or dedicated game console owned by the user, and both the host device and client must be connected on a local and LAN-based network.\n (b) Any software or services appearing in the client are fully executed on the host device, rendered on the screen of the host device, and may not use APIs or platform features beyond what is required to stream the Remote Desktop.\n  (d) The UI appearing on the client does not resemble an iOS or App Store view, does not provide a store-like interface, or include the ability to browse, select, or purchase software not already owned or licensed by the user. For the sake of clarity, transactions taking place within mirrored software do not need to use in-app purchase, provided the transactions are processed on the host device.\n In other words, unless it\u2019s a full remote desktop app, a cloud gaming service is not allowed as these guidelines are written today \u2014 even though very narrowly tailored LAN services like Steam Link and Sony\u2019s PS4 Remote Play are.\n  Google and Microsoft probably don\u2019t want to offer signup options within the apps themselves because that would mean giving Apple a 30 percent cut of subscription revenue, but apps without \u201caccount creation\u201d options violate section (c). Abiding by section (a) is also impossible considering these cloud servers on which the games are running are not owned by and located in the homes of consumers, but placed in data centers far away. And section (e) just flat out says this type of thing \u2014 a \u201cthin client for cloud-based app\u201d \u2014 can\u2019t exist in the App Store at all; it\u2019s not \u201cappropriate,\u201d Apple says.\n There are some workarounds here. For instance, the Shadow cloud gaming service gives you access to a remote computer \u201chost device\u201d that is not technically owned by the user, but rented from the company itself. It\u2019s also not on the same network as the device that\u2019s accessing it. Yet Shadow works, and it\u2019s available on iOS today.\n A Shadow spokesperson tells  The Verge that, when it found its iOS app was in dispute with Apple earlier this year, it removed the quick launch feature that let users boot right into games. It was then approved, because the app functioned more like a remote desktop service \u2014 the \u201cgeneric mirror of the host device\u201d that Apple mentions as an exception in its App Store guidelines. With Shadow, you still have to go and install Steam, login, and access your existing titles just as you would on any other remote desktop app. But the device users remote into is a gaming PC that Shadow rents to you on a monthly basis, which is a clever way around these restrictions.\n iOS users will miss out n the mobile-centric cloud gaming wave that\u2019s set to arrive with xCloud\n Valve did something similar with Steam Link by removing the option to purchase games from the iOS version of the app, as Apple took issue with the fact that Steam Link effectively acted as an app store within the App Store that circumvented Apple\u2019s review processes.\n What does all this mean? Well, for now, iOS users are going to be missing out on the mobile-centric cloud gaming wave that\u2019s set to arrive with xCloud\u2019s launch. There is conceivably a way Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia could find ways around this by changing the core functionality of their respective apps.\n But it seems unlikely in the short term. The App Store is a massive market so lucrative developers have for years jumped through hoop after hoop to  access its nearly 1.5 billion users. In this case, however, there is a fundamental disconnect between how these services operate and the way Apple wants software to function on the iPhone and iPad. That doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going to change any time soon.", "posttime": "2020-08-07 06:47:07", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "Hurricane season in the Atlantic has so far been quite active, with nine storms chewing through the alphabet already\u2014two of them (Hanna and Isaias) reached hurricane strength before making landfall. Unfortunately, this pattern isn\u2019t expected to let up, as hurricane outlooks have upgraded the odds that this highly active season is going to continue. In fact, NOAA is suggesting that we could be considering names starting with Y before things settle down for the winter.\n  In May, NOAA\u2019s hurricane season outlook gave 60 percent odds of above-average activity, with something like 13 to 19 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes, and three to six major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher.\n On Thursday, NOAA  released an updated outlook with higher probabilities. \u201cThe season is now expected to be one of the more active in the historical record,\u201d it notes. The outlook now calls for between 19 and 25 named storms and with seven to 11 hurricanes, though the number of major hurricanes is unchanged. Because the potential energy available for storms can produce one big storm or multiple smaller ones, the total is often calculated as \u201cAccumulated Cyclone Energy,\u201d or ACE. An above-normal hurricane season hits 120 percent of the median ACE, while clearing 165 percent defines an extremely active season. The new outlook sees the 2020 season hitting anywhere from 140 to 230 percent of median ACE.\n  A number of factors affect hurricane activity in the Atlantic, so there are several reasons for this activity outlook. First, sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic are warm, providing a key ingredient for hurricanes\u2014water vapor to fuel a storm. Wind patterns are also remaining conducive to both forming new storms and strengthening existing ones. That includes winds around the West African monsoon helping to create the low-pressure systems that can seed a tropical storm. It also includes weak wind shear, the contrast between low- and high-altitude wind speeds that can cause a tropical storm to lean over and lose its organization.\n Finally, the outlook in the Pacific Ocean has started leaning towards La Ni\u00f1a conditions developing this fall. The Pacific has been in a neutral state between clear La Ni\u00f1a or El Ni\u00f1o for over a year, but things are trending toward cooler waters in the eastern equatorial Pacific, driving the resulting atmospheric patterns. La Ni\u00f1as tend to encourage weak wind shear over the hurricane region of the Atlantic, aiding hurricane development, while El Ni\u00f1o conditions have the opposite effect.\n A group at Colorado State University that also produces hurricane season outlooks  similarly updated its numbers upward this week, as it had already done in both June and July. The researchers\u2019 central estimates now total to around 24 named storms, 12 hurricanes, and five major hurricanes. And with more activity, they note an increased probability of landfalling hurricanes.\n But all of these outlooks are simply probabilistic statements about the  conditions for potential hurricanes, rather than forecasts of specific storms.

Gross bookings for Uber&#39;s core ride-hailing business plunged by 75 percent compared with a year earlier\u2014from $12.2 billion to $3 billion.\n That was offset somewhat by rapid growth in Uber&#39;s delivery business. Delivery bookings more than doubled from $3.4 billion to $7 billion.\n The company lost $1.8 billion in the second quarter on a GAAP basis. Ignoring one-time charges, Uber has been losing around $1 billion per quarter for the last couple of years.\n  Prior to the pandemic, Uber CEO\u00a0Dara Khosrowshahi was bullish about the company&#39;s financial future. After reporting a $1.1 billion loss for the fourth quarter of 2019,\u00a0Khosrowshahi said in February that he expected Uber to start generating a profit by the end of 2020.\n At the time, Uber&#39;s rides business was (just barely) profitable. But it was being dragged down by big losses from Uber Eats, where Uber was spending heavily in pursuit of growth. Uber expected the rides business to become more profitable over time, while losses in the delivery business would decline as growth slowed.\u00a0We  argued at the time that this plan wasn&#39;t as crazy as it might seem.\n But then the coronavirus hit, and Uber was forced to throw those projections out the window.\u00a0In May, Uber  laid off 3,700 people in an effort to contain mounting losses.\n Demand for rides cratered, while demand for deliveries soared. In his Thursday statement,\u00a0Khosrowshahi argued that Uber&#39;s product portfolio had a &#34;natural hedge&#34; since people ordered more takeout even as they cut back on going out.\n Still, Uber says that its rides business earned a $50 million profit on an EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) basis. The problem is that this figure is nowhere close to offsetting losses and overhead elsewhere\u2014including the delivery business and Uber&#39;s expensive self-driving project.\n Fortunately, Uber is in no danger of running out of money; it has almost $8 billion in cash and short-term investments. It could easily burn cash at this rate for another year.", "posttime": "2020-08-07 06:16:24", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

"note_en": "Uber\u2019s   delivery business \u2014 better known as Uber Eats \u2014 is now bigger than its original and core ride-hailing division, based on adjusted net revenue. Now, adjusted net revenue tells only a piece of this evolving Uber story. Income, or losses in the case of Uber\u2019s delivery business, are also important.\n Still, looking at the change of the past year, and specifically in the past two quarters, it\u2019s clear that Uber\u2019s strategy has shifted. And all eyes are on delivery.\n   Uber\u2019s reported net loss was $1.78 billion in the second quarter of 2020, down from a year-ago net loss of $5.24 billion. The company went public last year, resulting in various one-time, non-cash costs. The company\u2019s net loss worked out to a loss of $1.02 per share. That was enough to beat analysts\u2019 expectations of a $0.86 per-share deficit.\n Uber missed on profitability in the quarter, but did surpass expectations on top line, posting more revenue than the $2.18 billion figure investors expected.\n  There are three key ways to weigh the company\u2019s various businesses, of which only two are of material scale to the Uber\u2019s operating results, namely Mobility (ride-hailing), and Delivery ( Uber Eats)  . Here\u2019s how the pair stacked up in Q2 2020:\n      As you can see, Uber\u2019s food delivery business is doing far more gross dollars in transaction volume. However, as Uber has a better take-rate (the portion of gross spend it gets to keep as revenue) with ride-hailing than Uber Eats, the two had far closer adjusted net revenue numbers. Here, again, Delivery beat Mobility.\n When it came down to adjusted profit, Uber\u2019s traditionally-core business of ride-hailing generated the superior result, generating positive adjusted EBITDA, while delivery lost money using the same profit calculation method.\n In Q1 2020, Mobility generated more gross bookings, adjusted net revenue, and adjusted EBITDA than Delivery. In Q2, due to COVID-19 and its resulting economic impacts, two of the three numbers flipped. How fast the figures could change in the future if the market for ride-hailing recovers further, is not clear. Today\u2019s earnings call made it clear that Uber is more about bringing you food than taking you to the airport, and that\u2019s a big change for the American company.\n To be clear, ride-hailing isn\u2019t going anywhere. It\u2019s the dual focus of delivery and ride-hailing that Uber is counting on to get it through this rough patch of COVID-19 pandemic as well as fortify its revenue earning potential in more stable times.\n \u201cIt\u2019s become clear that we have a hugely valuable hedge across our two core businesses that is a critical advantage in any recovery scenario,\u201d Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said Thursday. \u201cWhen travel restrictions lift we know the mobility trips rebound. If restrictions continue or need to be re-imposed our delivery business will compensate.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-08-07 06:15:41", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u9001\u8d27,delivery,\u4f18\u6b65", "title": "\n\u4f18\u6b65\u7684\u9001\u8d27\u4e1a\u52a1\u73b0\u5728\u6bd4\u53eb\u8f66\u8fd8\u5927", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tUber\u2019s delivery business is now larger than ride-hailing\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/ubers-delivery-business-is-now-larger-than-ride-hailing/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9001\u8d27", "delivery", "\u4f18\u6b65"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "722c4202808d7887d1e5a8a74b9e0d9d.jpg", "infoid": 1016781, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "T-Mobile\u4eca\u5929\u516c\u5e03\u4e862020\u5e74\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b63\u5ea6\u7684\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e24\u5bb6\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u5408\u5e76\u540e\u5305\u62ecSprint\u5728\u5185\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b63\u5ea6\u3002\u770b\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4e0eSprint\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u5e2e\u52a9T-Mobile\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u58ee\u4e3e\u3002\nT-Mobile\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5176\u54c1\u724c\u5ba2\u6237\u603b\u6570\u5df2\u8d85\u8fc7\u7f8e\u56fd\u7535\u8bdd\u7535\u62a5\u516c\u53f8(AT&amp\uff1bT)\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u7f8e\u56fd\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5927\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\uff0c\u4ec5\u6b21\u4e8eVerizon\u3002\u57282020\u5e74\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b63\u5ea6\uff0cT-Mobile\u589e\u52a0\u4e86124.5\u4e07\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u7528\u6237\u603b\u6570\u8fbe\u52309830\u4e07\u3002\n\u4eca\u5929\uff0cT-Mo\u8fd8\u5206\u4eab\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u4e8e\u51765G\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u597d\u6d88\u606f\u3002\u6d0b\u7ea2\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u76842.5 GHz\u4e2d\u98915G\u73b0\u5df2\u5728\u4e9a\u7279\u5170\u5927\u3001\u8fbe\u62c9\u65af\u548c\u534e\u76db\u987f\u7279\u533a\u5f00\u901a\u3002\u829d\u52a0\u54e5\u3001\u4f11\u65af\u987f\u3001\u6d1b\u6749\u77f6\u3001\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5e02\u548c\u8d39\u57ce\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u5730\u533a\u4e5f\u67092.5 GHz\u76845G\u8986\u76d6\u3002\nT-Mobile\u76842.5 GHz 5G\u5e2e\u52a9\u5ba2\u6237\u5728\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u3002T-Mo\u5439\u6367\u51762.5 GHz 5G\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u4e0b\u8f7d\u901f\u5ea6\u5728300 Mbps\u5de6\u53f3\uff0c\u5cf0\u503c\u901f\u5ea6\u4e3a1Gbps\u3002\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u90e82.5 GHz\u76845G\u624b\u673a\u624d\u80fd\u4eab\u53d7\u8fd9\u4e00\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u624b\u673a\u5305\u62ecGalaxy S20\u7cfb\u5217\u3001Galaxy Note 10+5G\u3001OnePlus 7T Pro 5G\u8fc8\u51ef\u8f6e\u3001OnePlus 8\u548cLG V60 ThinQ 5G\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5373\u5c06\u63a8\u51fa\u7684Galaxy Note 20\u548cNote 20 Ultra\u3002", "note_en": "T-Mobile today reported its Q2 2020 earnings, which is the first quarter that includes Sprint  following the merger of the two carriers.

"note_en": "US chipmaker Intel is investigating a security breach after earlier today 20 GB of internal documents, with some marked &#34;confidential&#34; or &#34;restricted secret,&#34; were uploaded online on file-sharing site MEGA.\n The data was published by Till Kottmann, a Swiss software engineer, who said he received the files from an anonymous hacker who claimed to have breached Intel earlier this year.\n Kottmann received the Intel leaks because he manages a very popular Telegram channel where he regularly publishes data that accidentally leaked online from major tech companies through misconfigured Git repositories, cloud servers, and online web portals.\n The Swiss engineer said today&#39;s leak represents the first part of a multi-part series of Intel-related leaks.\n ZDNet reviewed the content of today&#39;s files with security researchers who have previously analyzed Intel CPUs in past work, who deemed the leak authentic but didn&#39;t want to be named in this article due to ethical concerns of reviewing confidential data, and because of their ongoing relations with Intel.\n Per our analysis, the leaked files contained Intel intellectual property respective to the internal design of various chipsets. The files contained technical specs, product guides, and manuals for CPUs dating back to 2016.\n       - Intel ME Bringup guides + (flash) tooling + samples for various platforms  - Kabylake (Purley Platform) BIOS Reference Code and Sample Code + Initialization code (some of it as exported git repos with full history)  - Intel CEFDK (Consumer Electronics Firmware Development Kit (Bootloader stuff)) SOURCES  - Silicon / FSP source code packages for various platforms  - Various Intel Development and Debugging Tools  - Simics Simulation for Rocket Lake S and potentially other platforms  - Various roadmaps and other documents  - Binaries for Camera drivers Intel made for SpaceX  - Schematics, Docs, Tools + Firmware for the unreleased Tiger Lake platform  - (very horrible) Kabylake FDK training videos  - Intel Trace Hub + decoder files for various Intel ME versions  - Elkhart Lake Silicon Reference and Platform Sample Code  - Some Verilog stuff for various Xeon Platforms, unsure what it is exactly.  - Debug BIOS/TXE builds for various Platforms  - Bootguard SDK (encrypted zip)  - Intel Snowridge / Snowfish Process Simulator ADK  - Various schematics  - Intel Marketing Material Templates (InDesign)\n None of the leaked files contain sensitive data about Intel customers or employees, based on ZDNet&#39;s review. However, the question remains to what else the alleged hacker had access to before stealing and releasing Intel&#39;s confidential files.\n In an emailed statement sent after this article&#39;s publication, Intel denied getting &#34;hacked,&#34; disputting Kottmann&#39;s claim.\n The company suggested that an individual with access to its Resource and Design Center might have downloaded the confidential data without authorization and shared it with the Swiss researcher. The  Intel Resource and Design Center is a web portal where Intel provides non-public technical documents to business partners integrating Intel chipsets into their respective products.

Biden Jr.\n The move, which comes as Mr. West\u2019s wife, Kim Kardashian West, has said her husband is struggling with mental illness, underscores that this will be an unusual, and unusually bare-knuckled, presidential election.\n The strategy became  overt on Tuesday,  when Lane Ruhland, a lawyer who has worked for the Trump campaign, delivered ballot signatures to Wisconsin elections officials on behalf of the West campaign.\n Ms. Ruhland worked for the state Republican Party during  Wisconsin\u2019s recount in the 2016 presidential election. She has been  representing the Trump campaign in  a lawsuit filed this year against a Wisconsin television station for airing an advertisement criticizing the president\u2019s coronavirus response.\n A spokesman for the law firm where Ms. Ruhland works, Husch Blackwell, said she was unavailable for comment.\n The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel also  reported that at least five other people connected to Mr. West\u2019s Wisconsin bid are active in the Republican Party or are Trump supporters.\n Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, said there was no legal conflict with a Trump campaign lawyer\u2019s involvement in the West operation. \u201cWe have no knowledge of anything Kanye West is doing or who is doing it for him,\u201d Mr. Murtaugh said.", "posttime": "2020-08-07 06:08:26",

"note_en": "Razors, scalpels, and knives are commonly made from stainless steel, honed to a razor-sharp edge and coated with even harder materials such as diamond-like carbon. However, knives require regular sharpening, while razors are routinely replaced after cutting materials far softer than the blades themselves.    Now engineers at MIT have studied the simple act of shaving up close, observing how a razor   can be damaged as it cuts human hair\u2014a material that is 50 times softer than the blade itself. They found that hair shaving deforms a blade in a way that is more complex than simply wearing down the edge over time. In fact, a single strand of hair can cause the edge of a blade to chip under specific conditions. Once an initial crack forms, the blade is vulnerable to further chipping. As more cracks accumulate around the initial chip, the razor&#39;s edge can quickly dull.\n  The blade&#39;s microscopic structure plays a key role, the team found. The blade is more prone to chipping if the microstructure of the steel is not uniform. The blade&#39;s approaching angle to a strand of hair and the presence of defects in the steel&#39;s microscopic structure also play a role in initiating cracks.\n  The team&#39;s findings may also offer clues on how to preserve a blade&#39;s sharpness. For instance, in slicing vegetables, a chef might consider cutting straight down, rather than at an angle. And in designing longer-lasting, more chip-resistant blades, manufacturers might consider making knives from more homogenous materials.\n  &#34;Our main goal was to understand a problem that more or less everyone is aware of: why blades become useless when they interact with much softer material,&#34; says C. Cem Tasan, the Thomas B. King Associate Professor of Metallurgy at MIT. &#34;We found the main ingredients of failure, which enabled us to determine a new processing path to make blades that can last longer.&#34;\n  Tasan and his colleagues have published their results in the journal  Science. His co-authors are Gianluca Roscioli, lead author and MIT graduate student, and Seyedeh Mohadeseh Taheri Mousavi, MIT postdoc.\n     Tasan&#39;s group in MIT&#39;s Department of Materials Science and Engineering explores the microstructure of metals in order to design new materials with exceptional damage-resistance.\n  &#34;We are metallurgists and want to learn what governs the deformation of metals, so that we can make better metals,&#34; Tasan says. &#34;In this case, it was intriguing that, if you cut something very soft, like human hair, with something very hard, like steel, the hard material would fail.&#34;\n    To identify the mechanisms by which razor blades fail when shaving  , Roscioli first carried out some preliminary experiments, using disposable razors to shave his own facial hair. After every shave, he took images of the razor&#39;s edge with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to track how the blade wore down over time.\n  Surprisingly, the experiments revealed very little wear, or rounding out of the sharp edge over time. Instead, he noticed chips forming along certain regions of the razor&#39;s edge.\n  &#34;This created another mystery: We saw chipping, but didn&#39;t see chipping everywhere, only in certain locations,&#34; Tasan says. &#34;And we wanted to understand, under what conditions does this chipping take place, and what are the ingredients of failure?&#34;\n     To answer this question, Roscioli built a small, micromechanical apparatus to carry out more controlled shaving experiments. The apparatus consists of a movable stage, with two clamps on either side, one to hold a razor blade and the other to anchor strands of hair. He used blades from commercial razors, which he set at various angles and cutting depths to mimic the act of shaving.\n  The apparatus is designed to fit inside a  , where Roscioli was able to take high-resolution images of both the hair and the blade as he carried out multiple cutting experiments. He used his own hair, as well as hair sampled from several of his labmates, overall representing a wide range of hair diameters.\n   Regardless of a hair&#39;s thickness, Roscioli observed the same mechanism by which hair damaged a blade. Just as in his initial shaving experiments, Roscioli found that hair caused the blade&#39;s edge to chip, but only in certain spots.\n  When he analyzed the SEM images and movies taken during the cutting experiments, he found that chips did not occur when the hair was cut perpendicular to the blade. When the hair was free to bend, however, chips were more likely to occur. These chips most commonly formed in places where the blade edge met the sides of the hair strands.\n  To see what conditions were likely causing these chips to form, the team ran computational simulations in which they modeled a steel blade cutting through a single hair. As they simulated each hair shave, they altered certain conditions, such as the cutting angle, the direction of the force applied in cutting, and most importantly, the composition of the blade&#39;s steel.\n  They found that the simulations predicted failure under three conditions: when the blade approached the hair at an angle, when the blade&#39;s steel was heterogenous in composition, and when the edge of a hair strand met the blade at a weak point in its heterogenous structure.\n  Tasan says these conditions illustrate a mechanism known as stress intensification, in which the effect of a stress applied to a material is intensified if the material&#39;s structure has microcracks. Once an initial microcrack forms, the material&#39;s heterogeneous structure enabled these cracks to easily grow to chips.\n   &#34;Our simulations explain how heterogeneity in a material can increase the stress on that material, so that a crack can grow, even though the stress is imposed by a soft material like  ,&#34; Tasan says.\n  The researchers have filed a provisional patent on a process to manipulate steel into a more homogenous form, in order to make longer-lasting, more chip-resistant blades.\n  &#34;The basic idea is to reduce this heterogeneity, while we keep the high hardness,&#34; Roscioli says. &#34;We&#39;ve learned how to make better blades, and now we want to do it.&#34;        More information:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tG.

Embarrassment, at first, to the exclusion of all other feelings. But embarrassment curled at the edges with a weariness, the sort that comes over you when you are set on a track by something outside your control, and which, although it is not your experience, is so known in all its cultural forms that you could unscrew the cap of the pen in your hand and jot down in the notebook on your lap every single thing that will happen and everything that will be felt for the foreseeable future. Including the surprises.\n  \u2018So \u2013 we\u2019d better get cooking the meth,\u2019 I said to the Poet, sitting to one side and slightly behind me. The Poet with an effort got his face to work and responded properly. \u2018This time we quit while the going\u2019s good.\u2019 The doctor and nurse were blank. When we got home the Poet said he supposed they didn\u2019t watch much US TV drama. It was only later that I thought that maybe, ever since  Breaking Bad\u2019s first broadcast, oncologists and their nurses all over the Western world have been subjected to the meth-cooking joke each time they have applied their latest, assiduously rehearsed, non-brutal techniques for telling a patient as gently but honestly as possible, having first sized up their inner resilience with a few apparently innocent questions (\u2018Tell me what you have been expecting from this appointment\u2019), that they have inoperable cancer. Perhaps they failed to laugh at my \u2013 doubtless evasive \u2013 bid to lighten the mood, not because they didn\u2019t get the reference, but because they had said to each other too often after such an appointment: \u2018If I hear one more patient say they should start cooking meth, I\u2019m going to wrestle them to the ground and bellow death into their faces \u2013 \u201cPay attention, I\u2019m fucking telling you something important!\u201d\u2019 I was mortified at the thought that before I\u2019d properly started out on the cancer road, I\u2019d committed my first platitude. I was already a predictable cancer patient.\n Then again, what if I had taken the other option, and sat in dignified silence for a moment collecting myself, which I\u2019m sure is how one would describe the short hiatus, and then asked serious, intelligent questions about the nature of the treatment the Onc Doc was suggesting, not to \u2018cure\u2019 me (he had slipped that in right at the start for me to run with or blank out, as I chose), but which had a 20 to 30 per cent chance of producing a remission for an unguessable period? After listening as carefully as my muddled head could manage to his answer (three cycles of chemotherapy, a scan, a course of radiotherapy, taking us up to Christmas, almost, then we would see), I would then be obliged to ask the next, inevitable \u2018how long\u2019 question, hedged about with all the get-out clauses for Onc Doc, who after all wasn\u2019t to blame for my cancer.\n \u2018Of course, I understand it would be unreasonable of me to expect you to know, with any certainty, when I\u2019m likely to die if I have the treatment. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s different for everyone, and only based on statistics, but could you perhaps give me a general idea: years \u2026 months \u2026 weeks?\u2019\n The print size in my mind decreased with time\u2019s incremental decline, and as I arrived at the last word \u2013  weeks \u2013 it suddenly struck me, with all the force of the fullest sense of the word \u2018struck\u2019, that this could actually be his answer and not just the logical next time period in my sentence. Every cell in my body, except those responsible for maintaining a reasonable, calm exterior, was now lindy-hopping at that possibility, the only one that hadn\u2019t occurred to me until that moment.  Weeks. Still, the question itself was there waiting in line for me in the ready-made scripts file, for this unique to me but culturally familiar diagnostic moment, just after the Contemporary International Smart Cancer Joke.\n Not that I\u2019ve asked yet. I am getting ahead of myself. In fact, the Onc Doc,  my Onc Doc as I now think of him, was drawing little circles, the results of my PET scan and bronchoscopy, on a ready made outline map of a human torso, skinned and boned to show the lungs and lymph nodes, so that I could see the smallness of the tumour (good) in the lower left lobe, but also that it was too close to the pleura to be operable (not so good), and how its somewhat active cells (rather bad) had already travelled along two lymph nodes up to a third beside my oesophagus (more than rather bad). With that careful insertion of \u2018to treat, not to cure\u2019 in his suggested plan of action, he had in effect just told me I was going to die in his care, sooner rather than later. Now I had to decide, do I want to ask that obvious next question? And the one after that? (How long, then, without treatment?) I believe he knew exactly how these appointments went. Why should I make it easy for him, I now thought? It\u2019s quite hard to rapidly absorb the notion that someone forecasting your fairly imminent death might not be your enemy. More than that, the great weariness combined with the previously mentioned embarrassment, at the idea of asking question B or 2 and thereby setting the expected ball of clich\u00e9s rolling, was overwhelming. Instead of complying, I imagined I could instead nod a thank-you and take my leave of the doctor and the nurse. The Poet would leave with me, and we\u2019d never mention it again. The Woman with No Name approach. A short shriek of Morricone, after the door has closed behind us. But that wouldn\u2019t do, either. After the heroic moment there would be the hour-by-hour living. Everyday life, even a shortened one, doesn\u2019t permit heroic blankness in the way film does. Say, Leone\u2019s long, long close-up of Eastwood\u2019s or Fonda\u2019s impassive face; the Warhol movie of John Giorno sleeping for five hours and 20 minutes; Jarman\u2019s 79-minute single shot of saturated blue.\n Or I could do nothing. I could sit in sadistic silence waiting for whatever is next on his list of diagnostic appointment moves for all occasions.\n  Sullen rudeness is a possible option handed to us cancerees. It would institute a period of bad behaviour as one\u2019s own private glumly gleeful saturnalia, world turned upside down, lord of misrule regulated havoc, for a short period before the great slog of getting on with it began again, cancer or no cancer. I probably couldn\u2019t sulk unto death, no matter that I\u2019m one of the foremost sulkers on the planet. I\u2019d get hungry. Or want to watch TV. Or even have an itch I had to scratch, and any such desire immediately and fatally cracks the implacable wall of sulk. Another route through the carefully tended maze of standard responses looks like the most spontaneous, although it really needs to be yelled by Jack Lemmon, tortoise-style, sticking his neck right out, inches from Onc Doc\u2019s face. \u2018You\u2019re telling me I\u2019ve got CANCER? That I\u2019m going to DIE, because don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know that INOPERABLE means it\u2019ll spread along the tracks from lymph node to nymph load (I\u2019d apologise for that, but I\u2019m not sorry). You\u2019ve just said you reckon, with all your hedging and ditching, that I\u2019m going to be DEAD IN THREE YEARS. If I\u2019m LUCKY. Have I got that RIGHT?\u2019\n Actually, he said \u2018two to three years\u2019. (The  weeks moment passed, leaving me less cheered than I ought to have been.) But I\u2019ve taken the long view to stop any quibbling. I do wonder, now he\u2019s laid the numbers out, with all the ifs and buts and maybes, how he manages his probability predictions. Does he pop an extra year on after \u2018or\u2019, for luck, like one for the pot? Or does he shift the lower end of the prediction a little towards the future to soften the felt brevity of a single year to someone whose time is slipping past at the speed of a 67-year-old\u2019s perception. Perhaps he\u2019s always as scrupulously accurate as possible in these situations, because, although he would like to offer a false glimmer of optimism which is said to be as good as a placebo, he doesn\u2019t want to risk my ghostly or my next of kin\u2019s litigious fury if I died a day short of his over-generous soonest prediction. So I should believe him because fear of a lawsuit makes doctors realistic and therefore trustworthy. This not crazily short but vague two-to-three-years is a difficult real-life calculation for me. On the one hand, to die pushing seventy years of age is no great tragedy, even if my id would like to know what the fuck age has got to do with being rubbed out. Even so, such reasonableness doesn\u2019t take account of the kind of thoughts that run swiftly through my mind. Two to three years. Will the battery on the TV remote run out first? How many inches will the weeping birch grow, the one planted by the Poet for my sixtieth birthday (soppy old radical versifier)? I suppose I won\u2019t need another cashmere sweater to keep me warm come the planet\u2019s apocalypse, the ones I\u2019ve already got will survive the moths for a couple of years or even three should it come sooner than my own apocalypse. I very much regret the disappearance of a website I once bookmarked called Sensible Units. It took a scientific unit of quantity and resolved it into units that are much more easily or entertainingly imagined. Who knew that 1 cm of depth is equivalent to 29 human female fingernail thicknesses? Or that 80 gigabytes can be visualised as 110 CDs or 25 human genomes?\n So, when my Onc Doc announced that I had cancer, inoperable cancer, and that there was no cure, but some lengthy and famously unpleasant treatment that might get in the way of its speedy (the word \u2018aggressive\u2019 comes to mind but wasn\u2019t actually said) progress, I chose the threadbare joke, from the already ready possible options. Because I had to choose something. But, as well as doing what I had to do in my new role, and for more than any other reason, it was a short-term panic-stricken solution for the flood of  embarrassment, much more powerful than alarm or fear, that engulfed and mortified me at finding myself set firmly on that particular well-travelled road. I am and have always been embarrassed by all social rituals that require me to participate in a predetermined script. It may simply be that I am not a natural actor. That would account for the funk. Perhaps, having been handed this inescapable part, I was suffering from stage fright. It goes deep. I can perform at other people\u2019s dinner tables like a chattering magpie, arguing and picking up on the conversation to make a joke or say something smart. Then I go home covered with a layer of self-disgust as if I\u2019d been rolling in donkey shit, and for a day or two afterwards, I stay in bed with the covers over my head in shame. In public and prescribed ritual, I have no easy get-out, but I can\u2019t just get on with it. The only way I can manage \u2013 gracelessly \u2013 is to keep my head down, my eyes low, dig my fingers hard into my palm, and move my mouth a little, like John Redwood singing the Welsh national anthem, while other people enjoy themselves intoning the required utterances. Ever since I was a child, it\u2019s been like that.\n \u2018Y \u200b have to say, \u201cI wish you long life,\u2019\u2019 and shake his hand,\u2019 my father told me on our way to visit a relative sitting shiva. The rest of the journey was an agony of anticipation. I knew I couldn\u2019t say those words. I wouldn\u2019t be able to get them out. They were ridiculous, not what I\u2019d really ever say to someone else. Not what small children would say and do, and it seems I could only play one role at a time. I\u2019ve never been able to make my face work properly while repeating a set speech. Also, it seemed mean-spirited towards the newly dead to hope the mourner lived longer, who after all already had. \u2018It\u2019s what you do. Just say it and then go and get a smoked salmon bagel.\u2019 I could almost see that the anguish of the occasion was not actually mine, but belonged to the bereaved. Still, I couldn\u2019t bear to think about doing it. It wasn\u2019t what I would say, therefore I couldn\u2019t say it. I think also, it was expected of me, and therefore I couldn\u2019t do it. I wonder what would have happened if I hadn\u2019t been instructed. Would I have taken his hand and said something suitable? What could that be? I might just have said, as I would now, \u2018I\u2019m very sorry.\u2019 Why wasn\u2019t I allowed to do that? Because. We arrived and I took the hand offered me, but failed to look into his eyes, which, because of the low seating arrangement for chief mourners, were level with mine. I think I stared off to one side. And I managed only a mumbled noise, a strangled moan. Nothing that could be mistaken for \u2018I wish you long life.\u2019 I\u2019d failed and although I knew I was in trouble, I was relieved not to have said the words out loud, while people watched me and smiled at the sweet little girl maintaining the grown-up tradition with archaic words translated from the Yiddish.\n Growing up hasn\u2019t helped. Marriage ceremonies have been as difficult, even though I was an adult. The first was a blur, although I remember the fingers digging into my palm, and handing over my gold opal ring to my betrothed, just before we went in to be \u2018done\u2019, so he could slip it on my finger with the opal at the back, because we hadn\u2019t got round to even thinking about a ring until the morning of the registry office ceremony. Certainly, I was embarrassed and tied in knots by the corniness of the whole performance. Roger didn\u2019t mind, he always enjoyed me disconcerting his parents. By the time of my second marriage, well into my dog days, I had enough confidence to ask the registrar who was to perform the ceremony if I could just say \u2018Yes\u2019 when it got to the bit where I was required to say \u2018I do,\u2019 and to miss out repeating the affirmations about better or worse, sickness and bla bla bla, already much minimised by me and the Poet. She looked at me as if I\u2019d kicked her favourite bunny. \u2018We  are allowed to give people permission to do that,\u2019 she said. \u2018But only when they\u2019re terminally ill and have difficulty speaking.\u2019 I stopped myself from saying that I wasn\u2019t feeling too perky, actually, and who knows what it might turn into. Properly shamed, I went through with it, sotto voce and choking back some but not all the nervous giggles that always rise up when I\u2019m forced to participate in ritual. The Poet said I behaved childishly and I completely agreed. I decided I was definitely not going to do that again, no matter how practical it might be.\n Now I was faced with the prospect of a rather lengthy (in one view) public/private performance by which to be excruciated. A sudden death requires others to deal with the difficulty of ritual. A stroke, a heart attack. Then it\u2019s all someone else\u2019s problem. But this diagnostic appointment was the announcement of yet another version of the show going on the road in which I was to star. I had been formally inducted into Cancer World. (Mixing my metaphors, I\u2019m afraid. Which should it be, the theme park or the lack of variety show?) I was handed my script, though all the lines were known already and the moves were paced out. There are no novel responses possible. Absolutely none that I could think of. Responses to the diagnosis; the treatment and its side effects; the development of cancer symptoms; the pain and discomfort; the dying; the death. Do I have to start a campaign? Wear a badge, run, climb walls, swim inordinate lengths, dance the tango for a very long time, in return for money for cancer research? Whatever that is. Does the money go to the drug companies? To university labs? To Jeremy Hunt? What is this crowd-funded research, where is it happening? Am I going to appear calm in the face of destiny? Actually cheerful, with people saying I was wonderful? Should I affirm my atheism or collapse into religious comfort? Or should I turn my face to the wall? And when the symptoms kick in, will I suffer in silence, quote Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, or will I refuse to go gentle and make an almighty fuss (\u2018Excuse me,  I\u2019m the cancer patient here!\u2019). Dear God, not a bucket list? Really, there is nothing that I want to do before I die, except perhaps just lie back and enjoy the morphine, daydreaming my way to oblivion.\n One thing I state as soon as we\u2019re out of the door: \u2018Under no circumstances is anyone to say that I lost a battle with cancer. Or that I bore it bravely. I am  not fighting, losing, winning or bearing.\u2019 I will not personify the cancer cells inside me in any form. I reject all metaphors of attack or enmity in the midst, and will have nothing whatever to do with any notion of desert, punishment, fairness or unfairness, or any kind of moral causality. But I sense that I can\u2019t avoid the cancer clich\u00e9s simply by rejecting them. Rejection is conditioned by and reinforces the existence of the thing I want to avoid. I choose how to respond and behave, but a choice between doing this or that, being this or that, really isn\u2019t freedom of action, it\u2019s just picking one\u2019s way through an already drawn flow chart. They still sit there, to be taken or left, the flashing neon markers on the road that I would like to think isn\u2019t there for me to be travelling down. I am appalled at the thought, suddenly, that someone at some point is going to tell me I am on a journey. I try but I can\u2019t think of a single aspect of having cancer, start to finish, that isn\u2019t an act in a pantomime in which my participation is guaranteed however I believe I choose to play each scene. I have been given this role. (There, see? Instant victim.) I have no choice but to perform and to be embarrassed to death. I wish you long life.\n W \u200b got home before I said: \u2018Well, I suppose I\u2019m going to write a cancer diary.\u2019 The only other thing I might have said was: \u2018Well, I\u2019m not going to write a cancer diary.\u2019 Right there: a choice? I\u2019m a writer, have been since I was small, and have earned my living at it for thirty years. I write fiction and non-fiction, but it\u2019s almost always personal. I start with me, and often enough end with me. I\u2019ve never been apologetic about that, or had a sense that my writing is \u2018confessional\u2019. What else am I going to write about but how I know and don\u2019t know the world? I may not make things up in fiction, or tell the truth in non-fiction, but documentary or invented, it\u2019s always been me at the centre of the will to put descriptions out into the world. I lie like all writers but I use my truths as I know them in order to do so.\n \u2018I wonder if I am not talking yet again about myself. Shall I be incapable, to the end, of lying on any other subject?\u2019 I used this quote from  Malone Dies as the epigraph to my non-fiction so-called travel book  Skating to Antarctica, though it would have been apt, to my mind, at the front of any book I\u2019ve written, fiction or non-fiction, memoir or travel, history or fantasy.  Skating concerned a voyage I took around the Antarctic peninsula and the story of my rather brief, rackety relationship with my mother. \u2018You know,\u2019 I\u2019d say gayly to people who asked what it was about. \u2018Icebergs, mothers. That sort of thing.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t even describe the most extraordinary landscape on the planet without reference to myself and my life outside the Antarctic cruise. I can\u2019t use my eyes to see things without my eyes knowing that what they see is conditioned by what I\u2019ve known and what I\u2019ve been. Ditto my mind to think things. So be it. I\u2019m a writer. I\u2019ve got cancer. Am I going to write about it? How am I not? I pretended for a moment that I might not, but knew I had to, because writing is what I do and now cancer is what I do, too.\n And then the weariness. A fucking cancer diary? Another fucking cancer diary. I think back to cancer diaries I have read, just because they\u2019re there. You don\u2019t seek cancer diaries out, they come at you as you turn the pages of magazines and newspapers or thumb through Twitter and blogs. How many have I read? I can\u2019t remember, but they\u2019ve spanned decades. I recall Ruth Picardie, a young woman in her thirties, with small children. John Diamond, married to Nigella Lawson and dying stylishly.
