", "note_en": "Researchers have dropped a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit on Twitter for a known cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA). The move comes as reports surface of in-the-wild exploitation of the bug.\n Researchers at Positive Technologies published the PoC for the bug (CVE-2020-3580) on Thursday. One of the researchers there, Mikhail Klyuchnikov, noted that there were a heap of researchers now chasing after an exploit for the bug, which he termed \u201clow-hanging\u201d fruit.\n   The hunt for low hanging CVE-2020-3580 by  @ptswarm has begun. A lot of submissions/duplicates are waiting for  @Bugcrowd and  @Hacker0x01  #bugbounty\n  Meanwhile, Tenable researchers published an alert about the PoC, noting that it has started to see cyberattacks using the vulnerability on targets in the wild.\n \u201cTenable has also received a report that attackers are exploiting CVE-2020-3580 in the wild,\u201d according to its  Thursday alert. \u201cWith this new information, Tenable recommends that organizations prioritize patching CVE-2020-3580.\u201d\n And indeed, the PT PoC tweet was met with plenty of \u201cOoh thanks\u201d and \u201cthank you so much\u201d responses, presumably from would-be hackers.\n   Meanwhile, researchers at WebSec noted that the bug could be exploited for more than XSS:\n You could have gotten 2 CVE numbers for this, as this is not just XSS but also CSRF.\n  \u201cResearchers often develop PoCs before reporting a vulnerability to a developer and publishing them allows other researchers to both check their work and potentially dig further and discover other issues,\u201d Claire Tills, senior research engineer at Tenable, told Threatpost. \u201cPoCs can also be used by defenders to develop detections for vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, giving that valuable information to defenders means it can also end up in the hands of attackers.\u201d\n Given that a patch has been available for this vulnerability for several months, organizations are able to protect themselves which isn\u2019t the case with 0-day disclosures, she pointed out. \u201cHowever, unpatched vulnerabilities continue to haunt many organizations,\u201d Tillis added. \u201cThe public availability of a PoC is another stark reminder that effective patching is a vital step for organizations to protect themselves.\u201d\n  The Cisco ASA is a  cybersecurity perimeter-defense appliance that combines firewall, antivirus, intrusion prevention and virtual private network (VPN) capabilities, all meant to stop threats from making it onto corporate networks. A compromise of the device is akin to unlocking the front door of the castle for storming cyberattackers.\n XSS attacks occur when malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites; any visitors to the compromised websites are thus subject to drive-by attacks.\n Successful exploitation in this case means that unauthenticated, remote attackers could \u201cexecute arbitrary code within the [ASA] interface and access sensitive, browser-based information,\u201d Tenable added.\n Once in, they could modify the device\u2019s configuration, according to Leo Pate, an application security consultant at nVisium.\n However, the target would need to be logged into the ASA for the attackers to see any joy. \u201cWhile this sounds dangerous, exploiting this vulnerability requires an administrative user to login and navigate to the webpage where the attacker uploaded the malicious code,\u201d he added.\n As Tenable researchers said: \u201cAn attacker would need to convince \u2018a user of the interface\u2019 to click on a specially crafted link.\u201d This can be accomplished via a spear-phishing email campaign targeting probable ASA users using malicious links, or via watering-hole attacks.\n \u201cThe attack vector to get this in the hands of the right people is complex requiring a firewall administrator to be duped into clicking a cleverly crafted link,\u201d Andrew Barratt, managing principal for solutions and investigations at Coalfire, told Threatpost. \u201cFirewall administrators will need to ensure they\u2019re not accessing links to the ASA interface that appear to originate from outside.\u201d\n  Thanks to the sheer size of its footprint (including inside Fortune 500 companies), the Cisco ASA is no stranger to attention from cyberattackers. Last year for example, public PoC for another bug in the device ( CVE-2020-3452) started making the rounds, leading to a  spate of exploitation efforts.\n  The flaw tracked as CVE-2020-3580  was patched on October 21 as part of a group of XSS issues in Cisco\u2019s ASA as well as the Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) software, which is a unified firewall image that includes ASA management.\n \u201cAll four vulnerabilities exist because Cisco ASA and FTD software web services do not sufficiently validate user-supplied inputs,\u201d according to the advisory, which noted that the bug in question rates 6.1 out of 10 on the CVSSv3 vulnerability-severity scale.\n The number of vulnerable devices could be significant:  Researchers with Rapid7 last year found there to be 85,000 internet-accessible ASA devices. Of course, a good percentage of those could be patched against this particular vulnerability.\n \u201cExploits for appliances that may sit on the vanishing perimeter generally garner interest [from hackers], but fortunately in this case there are at least two things working against rampant exploitation,\u201d Tim Wade, technical director for the CTO team at Vectra, told Threatpost. \u201cFirst, a patch has been available since October. Second, an element of social engineering is required. This should provide some level of confidence for organizations with reasonable patch cycles and a security awareness program.\u201d\n Updating to the latest versions of the affected devices\u2019 software is of course recommended; however, there\u2019s more that can be done to mitigate the vulnerability, nVisium\u2019s Pate noted.\n \u201cOrganizations can ask their internal teams if they need to use the web management interface, and if so, is it available to everyone on the internet or just internally to our organization? If the web management interface isn\u2019t needed, then it should be disabled,\u201d he told Threatpost.\n Join Threatpost for \u201c  Tips and Tactics for Better Threat Hunting \u201d \u2014 a LIVE event on\u00a0  Wed., June 30 at 2:00 PM ET \u00a0in partnership with Palo Alto Networks.

\u201cThot Shit,\u201d some Black TikTok creators began  calling attention to that exploitation this week, inspiring others to  refuse to choreograph a dance to the hit song. The idea behind the movement is that Black artists on the platform create a disproportionate amount of content and culture \u2014 much of which is  re-packaged and monetized by popular white creators and culture at large.\n The song choice probably isn\u2019t a coincidence. The Megan Thee Stallion video is both a playful but important paean to essential workers \u2014 twerking grocery, food service and sanitation workers, in this case \u2014 and a biting commentary on the wealthy white establishment that exploits their labor without thinking twice.\n   The \u201cstrike\u201d doesn\u2019t have creators leaving the platform or even staying off of the app. Instead, Black creators who might normally contribute dances for the hot new song are sitting back and  pointing to what happens when they\u2019re not around. (Predictably: not a lot.)\n On the sound\u2019s page, some videos tease choreography but pivot into a statement about how  Black creators don\u2019t get their due on the app. In other videos, Black creators watch on in horror at awkward dance attempts failing to fill the void or laugh about how the song\u2019s lyrics are instructional but  non-Black TikTok still can\u2019t figure it out. The eminently danceable \u201cThot shit\u201d could build into Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s biggest hit yet, but just looking on TikTok you wouldn\u2019t know it.\n  When reached for comment on the phenomenon, TikTok praised Black creators as a \u201ccritical and vibrant\u201d part of the community. \u201cWe care deeply about the experience of Black creators on our platform and we continue to work every day to create a supportive environment for our community while also instilling a culture where honoring and crediting creators for their creative contributions is the norm,\u201d a TikTok spokesperson said.\n Many TikTok accounts participating in the strike  cite a recent explosion of white TikTokkers lip-syncing obliviously to a clip of Nicki Minaj\u2019s 2016 song \u201cBlack Barbies\u201d that  specifically praises Black bodies (\u201cI\u2019m a fucking Black Barbie/Pretty face, perfect body\u2026\u201d). White TikTok inexplicably flocked to the sound, boosting its popularity and crowding out Black creators. It\u2019s just one incident in a long history of Black creators feeling exploited and appropriated on social networks. Black TikTok dancers have long been left in the cold: Their original dance moves explode in popularity and get picked up by non-Black creators, who also pick up the credit along the way.\n The TikTok strike truly is amazing b/c it shows not only how US pop culture is built on stealing from Black people, but how the music industry depends on this cycle of theft &amp; white washing in order to monetize the music.\n The recent strike is the latest beat in the ongoing conversation over who gets to cash in on the wellspring of creativity that pours out of a platform like TikTok. More broadly, some creators believe that  TikTok\u2019s economics are stacked against them, even compared to other major platforms like YouTube. Across social media sites, creators,  particularly creators of color, are turning to collective action and  even unionizing to assert their power.\n For Black creators tired of seeing their work appropriated, collectively refusing to gift the world a hot new TikTok dance is certainly one way to show just how vital they are to the online ecosystem \u2014 something even a quick glance at the desolate \u201cThot Shit\u201d sound makes abundantly clear.", "posttime": "2021-06-26 07:22:05", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5f00\u53d1,\u9ed1\u8272,black,tiktok", "title": "\u5728Tiktok\uff0c\u9ed1\u8272\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u821e\u8e48\u7f62\u5de5\u547c\u5524\u7740\u521b\u9020\u6027\u7684\u5f00\u53d1 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tOn TikTok, Black creators\u2019 dance strike calls out creative exploitation\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/tiktok-strike-black-creators-thot-megan-thee-stallion/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5f00\u53d1", "\u9ed1\u8272", "black", "tiktok"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "dec31a285a19f7aa41b8b675fc3bbdad.jpg", "infoid": 1068348, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Miguel de Icaza\u7684\u7740\u540d\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08Miguel De Icaza\u5728\u63a8\u7279\u4e0a\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c\u60a8\u5c06\u80fd\u591f\u5728Windows 11\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528Android Apks\u3002\n \u5fae\u8f6f\u6628\u5929\u900f\u9732\uff0cWindows 11\u5c06\u901a\u8fc7Amazon App Store\u901a\u8fc7Microsoft Store\u652f\u6301Android\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u4f46\u4f3c\u4e4e\u60a8\u5c06\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u4efb\u4f55\u5730\u65b9\u5b89\u88c5\u81ea\u5df1\u7684APK\u3002\n \u5b83\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u4e00\u5207\u90fd\u5c06\u5982\u4f55\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u80af\u5b9a\u662f\u4ee4\u4eba\u5174\u594b\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u3002\n  \u6628\u5929\uff0c\u5fae\u8f6f\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba3\u5e03Windows 11\u5c06\u652f\u6301\u6bcd\u8bedAndroid\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5b89\u88c5\uff0c\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u5168\u90e8\u611f\u5230\u60ca\u8bb6\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Microsoft Store\uff0c\u60a8\u5c06\u80fd\u591f\u5728PC\u4e0a\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5b89\u88c5\u548c\u4f7f\u7528Android\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210Amazon App Store\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u3002\n \u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5728\u516c\u544a\u4e2d\u8feb\u5728\u7709\u776b\u7684\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u60a8\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u5728Windows 11\u4e0a\u4fa7\u8f7dAndroid Apks\uff1f Sideloading\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5c06\u5141\u8bb8\u60a8\u4eceMicrosoft Store\u5916\u90e8\u5b89\u88c5Android\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c06\u4e3a\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e93\u3002\n \u8fd9\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u662f\u201c\u662f\u201d\uff0c\u81f3\u5c11\u6839\u636e\u7740\u540d\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08Miguel de Icaza\u3002 Miguel\u8d1f\u8d23\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5305\u62ecGNOME\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5728Microsoft\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684Twitter Bio\u660e\u786e\u5730\u8bf4\u201c\u5728\u5fae\u8f6f\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5bf9\u4ed6\u4eec\u8bf4\u8bdd\u201d\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5e26\u7740\u4e00\u4e9b\u6000\u7591\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u3002\n \u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u7c73\u683c\u5c14\u7684\u8840\u7edf\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f88\u9ad8\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4ed6\u5f88\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6d88\u606f\u4e2d\u6b63\u786e\u3002 \n\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u5b83\u5e76\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u6e05\u695aWindows 11\u4e0a\u7684\u4fa7\u9762\u4fa7\u8f7dAndroid APKS\u5c06\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002 \u60a8\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u4e0b\u8f7dAPK\uff0c\u6309\u7167EXE\uff0c\u53cc\u51fb\u5b83\uff0c\u5e76\u5b89\u88c5\u5b83\uff1f \u6216\u8005\u4f1a\u6709\u67d0\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u534f\u8bae\u5417\uff1f \u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u7b49\u5f85\u770b\u5230\u8fd9\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u3002  \u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4e0e\u6b64\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5bf9Windows 11\u767b\u9646\u6b64\u79cb\u5929\u66f4\u4ee4\u4eba\u5174\u594b\uff01 ", "note_en": "Famed software engineer Miguel de Icaza confirmed on Twitter that you will be able to sideload Android APKs in Windows 11.\n Microsoft revealed yesterday that Windows 11 will support Android apps through the Microsoft Store via the Amazon App Store. But it seems you\u2019ll be able to install your own APKs from anywhere.\n It isn\u2019t clear exactly how this will all work yet, but this is certainly exciting news.\n  Yesterday, Microsoft surprised us all by announcing that  Windows 11 will support native Android app installation. Using the Microsoft Store, you\u2019ll be able to search for, install, and use Android apps right on your PC. This is possible through an integration of the Amazon App Store.\n However, a big question loomed over the announcement: would you be able to sideload Android APKs on Windows 11? Sideloading apps would allow you to install Android programs from outside the Microsoft Store, which would give you a much larger potential library.\n It seems the answer to that question is \u201cyes,\u201d at least according to famed engineer  Miguel de Icaza. Miguel is responsible for numerous software projects, including GNOME, and currently works at Microsoft. However, his Twitter bio explicitly says \u201cWorking at Microsoft, not speaking for them,\u201d so we need to take this news with some skepticism.\n Still, Miguel\u2019s pedigree in the software space is very high, so it\u2019s likely he\u2019s correct on this news.\n Of course, it\u2019s not quite clear how sideloading Android APKs on Windows 11 will work. Will you be able to simply download an APK as you would an EXE, double-click it, and install it? Or will there be some sort of workaround protocol? We\u2019ll need to wait to see how this develops.\n In the meantime, though, you can get even more excited about Windows 11 landing this Fall!", "posttime": "2021-06-26 07:16:06", "source_domain":

", "note_en": "According to an engineer at Microsoft, Windows 11 users will have the ability to sideload Android apps onto the operating system, which looks like an answer to one of the biggest questions we had when Microsoft announced it was  bringing Android apps to Windows 11 via the Amazon Appstore ( via  Android Police). This means that once Windows 11 launches, you won\u2019t just have to stick to the apps that Amazon makes available, but it does raise some new questions about how running Android apps on Windows will work.\n For example, it\u2019s unclear what the process for running or installing a sideloaded app will be. Chrome OS technically has the ability to run sideloaded apps, too, but  the process isn\u2019t exactly easy, as it involves enabling Linux and doing some command line work. We asked Microsoft for details about what running Android apps from outside the Amazon Appstore would be like, but we haven\u2019t gotten a response.\n  It\u2019s possible that the desire for sideloading apps onto Windows wouldn\u2019t be as strong had Microsoft included Google\u2019s Play Store instead of Amazon\u2019s Appstore. While having any app store will obviously grant Windows users access to many programs that they couldn\u2019t previously run on their computers, Amazon\u2019s  has some notable omissions from its catalog. If a Windows user wanted to run the Android version of Snapchat or Apple Music, they wouldn\u2019t be able to get them from Amazon.\n While sideloading apps helps solve this problem, it does raise concerns of its own. The first is the question of where users will obtain those apps: while there aren\u2019t likely to be piracy concerns with free apps like Snapchat, the ability to load an APK could allow people to get paid apps for free from less-than-legal repositories.\n There\u2019s also the question of safety and whether Windows will have the ability to scan sideloaded apps for potentially malicious behavior, a feature that Google builds into Android already.\n While it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s still a lot that Microsoft hasn\u2019t covered about what running Android apps on Windows 11\u2019s will actually be like (though  the technical details it\u2019s revealed are fascinating), it\u2019s still good to  have confirmation from someone at Microsoft that the selection of Android apps won\u2019t just be limited to what\u2019s on Amazon\u2019s Appstore.\n Hopefully Microsoft will start sharing more details on exactly how Android apps will work soon so it can get feedback from both Windows users and Android developers before the feature becomes available for everyone, likely later this year.", "posttime": "2021-06-26 07:15:32", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "windows,android,microsoft,\u7a0b\u5e8f,engineer", "title": "Microsoft Engineer\u8868\u793a\u7528\u6237\u5c06\u80fd\u591f\u5728Windows 11\u4e0a\u4fa7\u8f7dAndroid\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f ", "title_en": "Microsoft engineer says users will be able to sideload Android Apps on Windows 11", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550689/windows-11-android-app-sideload-amazon-app-store?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4", "via": "", "real_tags": ["windows", "android", "microsoft", "\u7a0b\u5e8f", "engineer"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "78826308b14523f1baf28a8c22b34209.jpg", "infoid": 1068346, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u56fd\u5bb6\u60c5\u62a5\u7f72\u7f72\u957f\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u521a\u521a\u5c06\u5176\u70ed\u60c5\u9884\u671f\u7684\u201c\u672a\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u73b0\u8c61\u201d\u62a5\u544a\u201c\uff0c\u8fd9\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u662f\u5bf9\u201d\u672a\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u98de\u884c\u7269\u4f53\u201c\uff08UFO\uff09\u7684\u8a00\u8bed\u91cd\u5851\u3002\n \u661f\u671f\u4e94\u665a\u4e0a\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5916\u5356\uff1a\u4ee4\u4eba\u5931\u671b\uff0c\u5f88\u5c11\u3002\u57289\u9875\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e94\u89d2\u5927\u697c\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u548c\u6700\u806a\u660e\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u6254\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u624b\uff0c\u627f\u8ba4\u4ed6\u4eec\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u7edd\u5927\u591a\u6570\u660e\u663e\u7684\u4e0d\u660e\u98de\u884c\u7269\u7684\u76ee\u51fb\u3002\n \u62a5\u544a\u5728\u91ca\u653e\u4e4b\u524d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u731c\u6d4b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4f1a\u8bf4\u51fa\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u4e8e\u5916\u6765\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6ca1\u6709\u6765\u8fc7\u3002\n \u201c\u6211\u4eec\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u8ff9\u8c61\u8868\u660e\u4ed6\u4eec\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u975e\u9646\u5730\u89e3\u91ca -

In the  9-page document, the Pentagon\u2019s best and brightest essentially threw up their hands and admitted that they can\u2019t explain the vast majority of apparent UFO sightings.\n The report drew immense amounts of speculation before its release because of the remote possibility that it would say something concrete about alien life, but that didn\u2019t come to pass.\n \u201cWe have no clear indications that there is any non-terrestrial explanation for them \u2014 but we will go wherever the data takes us,\u201d an anonymous US government official  told  NBC News shortly before the report was released. \u201cWe do not have any data that indicates that any of these unidentified air phenomena are part of a foreign collection program nor do we have any data that is indicative of a major technological advancement by a potential adversary.\u201d\n    \u201cThere are probably multiple types of UAP requiring different explanations based on the range of appearances and behaviors described in the available reporting,\u201d reads one section. \u201cOur analysis of the data supports the construct that if and when individual UAP incidents are resolved they will fall into one of five potential explanatory categories: airborne clutter, natural atmospheric phenomena, USG or U.S. industry developmental programs, foreign adversary systems, and a catchall \u2018other\u2019 bin.\u201d\n In total, the report examined 144 incidents, 143 of which investigators were unable to explain.\n    \u201cIn a small number of cases, military aircraft systems processed radio frequency (RF) energy associated with UAP sightings,\u201d reads one.\n \u201cThe UAPTF holds a small amount of data that appear to show UAP demonstrating acceleration or a degree of signature management,\u201d reads another.

And so, I&#39;m of the opinion that people have the right to decide whether to accept a vaccine or not, especially since these are experimental vaccines,&#34; said Dr. Robert Malone  during a Wednesday segment on Fox News&#39;s Tucker Carlson Tonight, saying YouTube deleted a video of him speaking about the associated risks.\n Opening the segment, Carlson shared some studies showing heart inflammation and death correlating with the use of the vaccines.\n &#34;A Norwegian study conducted of 100 nursing home residents who died after receiving Pfizer&#39;s corona shots. They found that at least 10 of those deaths were likely caused by the vaccine. 10%,&#34; Carlson said.\n  &#34;Young adults in the prime of their lives are being forced to take the vaccine because Tony Fauci said that,&#34; he said, contending Malone\u2019s expertise makes him &#34;the single most qualified&#34; person to share information about the technology and warrants him &#34;a right to speak.&#34;\n Malone clarified that he was not discouraging the use of the vaccine but was providing people with as much fair information as he could about their risks.\n &#34;This is a fundamental right having to do with clinical research ethics,&#34; he said. &#34;And so, my concern is that I know that there are risks. But we don&#39;t have access to the data, and the data haven&#39;t been captured rigorously enough so that we can accurately assess those risks \u2014 and therefore \u2026 we don&#39;t really have the information that we need to make a reasonable decision.&#34;\n  &#34;That&#39;s one of my other objections, is that we toss about these words, risk-benefit analysis, casually as if it&#39;s a very deep science. It&#39;s not. Normally, at this stage, the CDC [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices] would have performed those risk-benefit analyses. They would be data-based and science-based. They&#39;re not right now,&#34; Malone said.\n  Malone also said he has &#34;a bias that the benefits probably don&#39;t outweigh the risks&#34; for younger people who are being encouraged or required to take the vaccine.\n &#34;I can say that the risk-benefit ratio for those 18 and below doesn&#39;t justify vaccines, and there&#39;s a pretty good chance that it doesn&#39;t justify vaccination in these very young adults,&#34; he added.\n Malone  discovered in-vitro and in-vivo RNA transfection when he was at the Salk Institute in 1988, and he subsequently invented mRNA vaccines, which are being used over 20 years later to combat the spread of the coronavirus.\n YouTube told the Washington Examiner of the video that while it is &#34;open [to] discussions of potential treatments and clinical trials related to COVID-19 on YouTube, based on guidance from the CDC, FDA and other local health authorities, we don\u2019t currently allow content that recommends Ivermectin as an effective treatment or prevention method for the virus.&#34;\n &#34;As such, we removed content from Bret Weinstein&#39;s channels that violated this policy.

Of those, 247 had mild to moderate illnesses and isolated at home, never becoming sick enough to be admitted to a hospital. Six months after testing positive, 136 of the 247 (55 percent) still had lingering symptoms. And those 136 weren\u2019t only in the older age groups. In fact, in all the age groups between 16 and over 60 years old, between 50 percent and 60 percent of COVID patients reported persistent symptoms.\n For instance, of those between 16 and 30 years old, 52 percent (32 of 61) still suffered COVID-19 symptoms after six months. The most common symptoms were disturbed taste and/or smell, fatigue, difficulty breathing, difficulty concentrating, and memory problems.\n The study is small, and the exact percentages may not hold up in larger studies. However, it adds to a growing body of data finding that long-term symptoms from COVID-19 are common\u2014even in young people and/or people who had mild or even asymptomatic disease.\n    In  a non-peer-reviewed preprint study posted in March, researchers found that a third of the patients identified through medical records as suffering from so-called \u201clong-haul\u201d COVID-19 had initially reported asymptomatic cases. The study\u2019s authors, led by researchers in California, tracked the electronic medical records of 1,407 patients who had tested positive for the coronavirus, but these individuals were not sick enough to be hospitalized when they were infected. Of the 1,407, about 27 percent\u2014382 people\u2014developed long-term symptoms, and a third of them were initially asymptomatic.\n Likewise, in  another study posted this month, researchers tracked health insurance records of nearly two million people who tested positive for the coronavirus. The researchers found that about 23 percent of the patients sought care for a new post-COVID medical condition one or more months later. Of the people who had mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 that didn&#39;t require hospitalization, 27 percent experienced persistent symptoms, as did 19 percent of people who initially reported asymptomatic cases.\n The authors of the Norwegian study expressed concern about finding mild cases in young people leading to long-term problems. \u201cIt is worrying that non-hospitalized, young people (16\u201330 years old) suffer potentially severe symptoms, such as concentration and memory problems, dyspnea and fatigue, half a year after infection,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cParticularly for students, such symptoms might interfere with their learning and study progress\u2026 Considering the millions of young people infected during the ongoing pandemic, our findings are a strong impetus for comprehensive infection control and population-wide mass vaccination.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-26 06:38:02", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot",

large Oort Cloud object approaching the outer regions of the solar system.\n   The discovery has caused ripples of excitement within the planetary science community because of the object\u2019s unusually large size \u2013 initial estimates suggest it may be as big as 130\u2013160\u00a0km across, substantially bigger than some of the largest comets. Studying the object could also give researchers insights into an enigmatic process in the solar system.\n Catalogued as C/2014 UN271, the wandering visitor was found in archival data captured by the DES project, which investigates the cosmological mystery of dark energy by photographing distant galaxies.\n  \u201cThe object appears in about thirty images out of the [approximately] 80,000 that were taken over six years for the survey,\u201d  Gary Bernstein of the University of Pennsylvania, who co-discovered C/2014 UN271 along with PhD student  Pedro Bernardinelli, tells  Physics World. \u201cPedro instantly recognized it as being of special interest because of its nearly-escaping orbit and the great distance at which it was first seen,\u201d he adds.\n C/2014 UN271 seems to have come from a region some 10,000\u201320,000 times farther from the Sun than Earth. This is within the Oort Cloud \u2013 an immense shell of icy objects thought to envelop the entire solar system. On its current trajectory, the object takes nearly 5.5 million years to complete just one loop of its orbit.\n The object is probably rich in ice like a comet and is currently around three billion kilometres from the Sun. It will reach its closest point, known as perihelion, in 2031. At that time, it will be positioned below the plane of the solar system, near the orbit of Saturn.\n  Part of the interest in C/2014 UN271 is that it may be something of a transition object. Astronomers believe that many of the long period comets, that occasionally appear with bright tails, actually come from the Oort Cloud. Stars wandering near the Sun can nudge these objects from their positions and over millennia they work their way inwards, with the gravity of the giant planets tweaking their paths on each visit until they reside where we see them today.\n \u201cThe fact that [C/2014 UN271] has a perihelion so far away from the Sun might be telling us that it\u2019s done this a couple of times but is still in that process of eventually becoming some of those long period comets we know and love,\u201d explains  Meg Schwamb a Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud expert at Queen\u2019s University Belfast.\n Scientists will be keen to see how C/2014 UN271 behaves on its long journey. Will it, for example, exhibit outbursts in activity, or even disintegrate? The  Vera C Rubin Observatory, due to begin its ground-breaking survey from Chile in 2023, should be in a prime position to record whatever happens. \u201cWith Rubin Observatory coming back and imaging the sky every three nights we\u2019re going to get an effective movie of how this object has evolved over a decade,\u201d says Schwamb.\n  Initially, C/2014 UN271 did not appear to have a cloud of material \u2013 called a coma \u2013 around it. However, astronomers using the  Las Cumbres Observatory network announced in an Astronomer\u2019s Telegram bulletin on 22 June that they have detected such a feature using a large telescope in South Africa. The emergence of a coma could be the result of ices sublimating from the body\u2019s surface.\n  \u201cThere\u2019s a complex range of processes involved, with much yet to understand, and this is the biggest of the small worlds on an orbit from the Oort Cloud that we\u2019ve seen go through that start-up of activity,\u201d says  Michele Bannister, an outer solar system specialist based at the University of Canterbury.\n Some researchers have suggested C/2014 UN271 could be a destination for a sample-return mission.

Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin scrambled to save faltering markets at the start of the pandemic last year, America\u2019s top economic officials were in near-constant contact with a Wall Street executive whose firm stood to benefit financially from the rescue.\n  Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, was in frequent touch with Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Powell in the days before and after many of the Fed\u2019s emergency rescue programs were announced in late March. Emails obtained by The New York Times through a records request, along with public releases, underscore the extent to which Mr. Fink planned alongside the government for parts of a financial rescue that his firm referred to in one message as \u201cthe project\u201d that he and the Fed were \u201cworking on together.\u201d\n While some conversations were previously disclosed, the  newly released emails, together with public calendar records, show the extent to which economic policymakers worked with a private company as they were drawing up a response to the financial meltdown and how intertwined BlackRock has become with the federal government.\n Mr. Mnuchin held  60 recorded calls over the frantic Saturday and Sunday leading up to the Fed\u2019s  unveiling on Monday, March 23, of a policy package that included its first-ever program to buy corporate bonds, which were becoming nearly impossible to sell as investors sprinted to convert their holdings to cash. Mr. Mnuchin spoke to Mr. Fink five times that weekend, more than anyone other than the Fed chair, whom he spoke with nine times. Mr. Fink joined Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Powell and Larry Kudlow, who was the White House National Economic Council director, for a brief call at 7:25 the evening before the Fed\u2019s big announcement, based on Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s calendars.\n  The records reveal how often federal officials engaged with a Wall Street executive at a moment of crisis, as they strategized about how to turn around markets that were descending into chaos. Mr. Fink\u2019s firm is a huge player across many stock and debt markets, and its advisory arm helped to execute some of the Fed\u2019s crisis response during the 2008 financial meltdown. That market insight and experience got him a front-row seat at a pivotal moment, one that may have put him in a position to influence a rescue with huge ramifications for households, businesses and the entire U.S. economy.\n \u201cThey\u2019re about as close to a government arm as you can be, without being the Federal Reserve,\u201d said William Birdthistle, a professor at the Chicago-Kent College of Law and the author of a  book on funds.\n On March 24, 2020, the New York Fed announced that it had again hired BlackRock\u2019s advisory arm, which operates separately from the company\u2019s asset-management business but which Mr. Fink oversees, this time to carry out the Fed\u2019s purchases of commercial mortgage-backed securities and  corporate bonds.\n BlackRock\u2019s ability to directly profit from its regular contact with the government during rescue planning was limited. The firm signed a nondisclosure agreement with the New York Fed on March 22, restricting involved officials from sharing information about the coming programs.\n But how the Fed and Treasury devised their rescue package mattered to BlackRock. The company makes a profit by managing money for clients in an array of funds, generally charging a preset fee. It earns more when assets under its management grow. In the early days of the coronavirus crisis, as people converted financial holdings into cash, parts of its asset base  were contracting and its business outlook hinged on what happened in certain markets.\n While the Fed and Treasury consulted with many financial firms as they drew up their response \u2014 and practically all of Wall Street and much of Main Street  benefited \u2014 no other company was as front and center.\n Simply being in touch throughout the government\u2019s planning was good for BlackRock, potentially burnishing its image over the longer run, Mr. Birdthistle said. BlackRock would have benefited through \u201ctons of information, tons of secondary financial benefits,\u201d he said.\n Mr. Mnuchin could not be reached for comment. Asked whether top Fed officials discussed program details with Mr. Fink before his firm had signed the nondisclosure agreement, the Fed said Mr. Powell and Randal K. Quarles, a Fed vice chair who also appears in the emails, \u201chave no recollection of discussing the terms of either facility with Mr. Fink.\u201d\n \u201cNor did they have any reason to do so because the Federal Reserve Bank of New York handled the process with great care and transparency,\u201d the central bank added in its statement.\n Brian Beades, a spokesman for BlackRock, highlighted that the firm had \u201cstringent information barriers in place that ensure separation between BlackRock Financial Markets Advisory and the firm\u2019s investment business.\u201d He said it was \u201cproud to have been in a position to assist the Federal Reserve in addressing the severe downturn in financial markets during the depths of the crisis.\u201d\n  The disclosed emails between Fed and BlackRock officials \u2014 11 in all across March and early April \u2014 do not make clear whether the company knew about any of the Fed and Treasury programs\u2019 designs or whether they were simply providing market information.\n Emails indicate that Mr. Powell spoke with Mr. Fink on March 23, hours after the Fed announced its corporate bond program.\n \u201cLarry Fink is available to speak today regarding the project you will be working on together,\u201d an email from Mr. Fink\u2019s assistant directly to Mr. Powell said. \u201cPlease let us know if there is a convenient time for you.\u201d\n  The call does not appear on the  Fed chair\u2019s official schedule from that March. Those calendars generally track scheduled events, and may have missed meetings in early 2020 when staff members were frantically working on the market rescue and the Fed was shifting to work from home, a central bank spokesman said.\n Mr. Powell\u2019s calendars did show that he talked to Mr. Fink in March, April and May, and he has previously answered questions about those discussions.\n \u201cI can\u2019t recall exactly what those conversations were, but they would have been about what he is seeing in the markets and things like that, to generally exchanging information,\u201d Mr. Powell said at a  July news conference, adding that it wasn\u2019t \u201cvery many\u201d conversations. \u201cHe\u2019s typically trying to make sure that we are getting good service from the company that he founded and leads.\u201d\n BlackRock\u2019s connections to Washington are not new. It was a critical player in the 2008 crisis response, when the New York Fed  retained the firm\u2019s advisory arm to manage the mortgage assets of the insurance giant American International Group and Bear Stearns.\n Several former BlackRock employees have been named to top roles in President Biden\u2019s administration,  including Brian Deese, who heads the White House National Economic Council, and Wally Adeyemo, who was Mr. Fink\u2019s chief of staff and is now the No. 2 official at the Treasury.\n The firm has grown rapidly: Its assets under management swelled from $1.3 trillion  in early 2009 to $7.4 trillion in 2019. By the end of  last year, they were $8.7 trillion.\n As it expanded, it has stepped up its lobbying. In 2004, BlackRock Inc.  registered two lobbyists and spent less than $200,000 on its efforts. By 2019 it had 20 lobbyists and spent nearly $2.5 million, though that declined slightly last year, based on OpenSecrets data.  Campaign contributions tied to the firm also jumped, touching $1.7 million in 2020 (80 percent to Democrats, 20 percent to Republicans) from next to nothing as recently as 2004.\n  In March, as some of BlackRock\u2019s own offerings were being rocked at the pandemic\u2019s onset in the United States, the firm reached out to Mr. Powell and Mr. Quarles, the emails show. In one or two cases, BlackRock appears to have had phone calls with Mr. Quarles. In others, Mr. Powell and Mr. Quarles did not reply, based on the released records.\n The firm\u2019s representatives also talked to Treasury policymakers other than Mr. Mnuchin in March, the emails show. One former official said such calls were part of routine information-gathering from a big market participant when markets were rapidly falling apart.\n BlackRock operates in  short-term debt markets that came under intense stress as people and companies rushed to move all of their holdings into cash. And problems were brewing in the corporate debt market, including in exchange-traded funds, which track bundles of corporate debt and other assets but trade like stocks. Corporate bonds were difficult to trade and near impossible to issue in mid-March 2020. Prices on some high-grade corporate debt E.T.F.s, including one of BlackRock\u2019s,  were out of whack relative to the values of the underlying assets, which is unusual.\n People could still pull their money from E.T.F.s, which both the industry and several outside academics have heralded as a sign of their resiliency. But investors would have had to take a financial hit to do so, relative to the quoted value of the underlying bonds. That could have bruised the product\u2019s reputation in the eyes of some retail savers.\n \u201cThis was the first time that E.T.F.s came under stress in a really systemic way,\u201d said Gregg Gelzinis, associate director for economic policy at the Center for American Progress.\n The Fed\u2019s programs helped to turn that around. The central bank supported the corporate bond market on March 23, 2020, by pledging to buy both already issued debt and new bonds. The program for existing bonds promised to also buy E.T.F.s, because they are a quick way to get access to a wide swath of the market. The bond market and  fund recovery was nearly instant.\n When the New York Fed retained BlackRock\u2019s advisory arm to make the purchases, it  rapidly disclosed details of those contracts to the public. The firm did the program cheaply for the government, waiving fees for exchange-traded fund buying and rebating fees from its own iShares E.T.F.s back to the New York Fed.\n The Fed has explained the decision to hire the advisory side of the house in terms of practicality.\n \u201cWe hired BlackRock for their expertise in these markets,\u201d Mr. Powell  has since said in defense of the rapid move. \u201cIt was done very quickly due to the urgency and need for their expertise.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-26 06:30:08", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News",

", "note_en": "Report says intelligence sources do not think aliens are behind UFOs but what they are is unclear\n   The mystery of  UFOs seen in American skies is likely to continue following the release of the US government\u2019s highly anticipated UFO report.\n The  report released on Friday afternoon made clear that while American intelligence officials do not believe aliens are behind the UFOs \u2013 or what scientists prefer to call unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) \u2013 that were observed by navy pilots, they cannot explain what the flying objects are.\n  The report confirms that the observed phenomena are not part of any US military operations.\n The Pentagon studied over 140 incidents reported by navy pilots of UAP seen over the last two decades for the report. Many were seen from the summer of 2014 into the spring of 2015.\n While the report said that some incidents could be the result of technological errors in sensors or observers, it noted that most of the UAP reported \u201cprobably do represent physical objects\u201d since they were registered across multiple sensors.\n The only UAP intelligence officials were able to identify \u201cwith high confidence\u201d turned out to be \u201ca large, deflating balloon\u201d.\n   The release of the report caps a six-month wait, since a group of elected officials succeeded in including the  Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 2021 in a $2.3tn coronavirus relief bill signed by Donald Trump last December.\n The act ordered government agencies to provide a declassified \u201cdetailed analysis of unidentified aerial phenomena data and intelligence\u201d and \u201ca detailed description of an interagency process\u201d for reporting UAP.\n In August, the Pentagon  resurrected a UAP investigations arm, calling it the UAP Task Force and directing it to \u201cdetect, analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to US national security\u201d. The taskforce and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence authored the report.\n The report notes that only since 2019 has the government had a standardized reporting system for UAPs, so \u201climited data and inconsistency in reporting\u201d were challenges in investigations.\n \u201cThe limited amount of high-quality reporting on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) hampers our ability to draw firm conclusions about the nature or intent of UAP,\u201d the report reads.\n The discussion of UFOs \u2013 at government level or outside it \u2013 has been stigmatized for decades. While some have used the UAP materials as fodder for theories on alien life, officials have pointed to the possible threat of the UAPs being from an adversary using technology unknown to the US.\n \u201cIn this country we\u2019ve had incidents where these UAPs have interfered and actually brought offline our nuclear capabilities,\u201d Luis Elizondo, former director of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, the earlier iteration of the Pentagon\u2019s UAP taskforce, told the  Washington Post. Elizondo resigned in 2017, out of frustration that UAP were not being taken seriously enough by defense leaders.\n  \u201cWe also have data suggesting that in other countries these things have interfered with their nuclear technology and actually turned them on, put them online.\u201d\n While the US government was ordered to publish the unclassified report, experts said that a classified annex, which the public will not see, contains some of the juiciest details.\n In recent years, the release of government videos showing unexplained flying things have provided firmer evidence that something, alien or not, is out there.\n Footage from two sightings in 2015 and a third in 2004 taken during training flights went viral online after they were leaked. The Pentagon ultimately confirmed the authenticity of the footage and  released them for the public in 2020.\n One of the videos shows an object resembling a flying, spinning top soaring through the air. \u201cLook at that thing!\u201d one of the pilots can be heard saying in amazement.\n  This April, more photos and videos taken by US navy personnel were  leaked online, showing triangular-shaped objects buzzing around in the sky. In May, leaked military footage showed  an oval flying object near a US navy ship off San Diego, an apparent hotspot for UAP.\n Members of the US navy have seen UAP frequently. Ryan Graves, a retired pilot,  told 60 Minutes pilots saw UAP in restricted airspace south-east of Virginia Beach \u201cevery day\u201d in 2014.\n  In a  statement released on Friday after the report\u2019s release, the Republican senator Marco Rubio, who has been a staunch advocate for investigation into UAPs, celebrated the report but emphasized that it is \u201cjust a first step\u201d.\n \u201cFor years, the men and women we trust to defend our country reported encounters with unidentified aircraft that has superior capabilities, and for years their concerns were often ignored and ridiculed,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThe Defense Department and intelligence community have a lot of work to do before we can actually understand whether these aerial threats present a serious national security concern.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-26 06:29:37", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u53d1\u5e03,releases,\u62a5\u544a", "title": "\u5b83\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u5929\u7a7a\u4e2d\uff1a\u7f8e\u56fd\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9884\u671f\u7684UFO\u62a5\u544a ", "title_en": "It came out of the sky: US releases highly anticipated UFO report", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/25/ufos-us-government-report", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u53d1\u5e03", "releases", "\u62a5\u544a"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "ae4c27b1e999b681ed9ac836dbf1dbb5.jpg", "infoid": 1068335, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Unreal Engine 5\u5c06\u8d4b\u4e88\u6240\u6709\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u521b\u9020\u8005\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5b9e\u65f63D\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c......

Unfortunately, the keynote was light on details. Will these apps use emulation? Will Windows&#39; existing Linux support be involved? We got our answers shortly after the keynote thanks to a\u00a0follow-up\u00a0 developer talk\u00a0that went into some details.\n The feature is officially called the &#34;Windows Subsystem for Android,&#34; which should tell you a lot about how it works. Windows currently has a &#34;Windows Subsystem for Linux&#34; (WSL), which uses a subset of the Hyper-V functionality to run Linux apps on a real Linux kernel alongside your Windows apps.\u00a0(Hyper-V lets a second guest OS access the bare metal hardware instead of running on top of the host OS with less access to resources.) Real Android phones use the Linux kernel, and Microsoft is building an Android framework on top of WSL for the Windows Subsystem for Android. It sounds like we&#39;re essentially getting x86 Android running on Hyper-V.\n  Android apps under Windows should feel just like native Windows apps, with a top-level window, taskbar entry, and the ability to be pinned to the start menu. During its presentation, Microsoft said, &#34;Behind the scenes, we actually create a proxy native app that handles the bridge between the Android app model and the Windows app model.&#34; Presumably, that means the system will provide things like a start menu shortcut, icons, entries in the app uninstall lists, and other minor Windows wrappings that will make the app feel native. Microsoft is trying to do this with as little emulation as possible\u2014maybe even no emulation, depending on your computer and app availability. Both Windows and Android run on x86 and Arm architectures, with Android heavily favoring Arm and Windows heavily favoring x86. If you&#39;re running Windows on Arm and want to run an Arm Android app, things will work out great. If you&#39;re on x86 Windows, Microsoft will try to ship you an x86 version of the Android app you want. But if the only thing available is an Arm app, &#34; Intel Bridge Technology&#34; is here to help by translating that Arm code into something an x86 CPU can run. Microsoft helpfully pointed out that this feature will also work on AMD CPUs.\n    Microsoft&#39;s approach is similar to the way a few other operating systems have gotten Android apps up and running. Chrome OS&#39;s  Android app support is probably the most prominent example. Chrome OS runs the Linux kernel already, and it stacks a containerized Android framework on top to run apps. If you have an x86 Chromebook, Chrome OS uses Android&#39;s built-in Arm-to-x86 binary translation. If you&#39;re on a Linux desktop OS, an installation of  Anbox will do the same thing\u2014loading the Android framework on top of Linux. You can even run Anbox on WSL today.\n Many people&#39;s last experience of x86 Android might have been from Intel&#39;s  2012-era push for Atom-powered x86 phones, resulting in terrible devices like the early Asus Zenfone line. X86 Android has come a long way since then; the Android Chrome OS launch in 2016 certainly helped the OS a lot. Even before that 2016 launch, Google had been pushing for increased x86 app support alongside Arm, and Google&#39;s development tools have made spitting out Arm and x86 binaries the default for some time now. Back in 2016, Google was expecting about 25 percent of Play Store apps to not support x86 and to need Arm translation. Today, with the larger x86 customer base thanks to Chrome OS, that number is probably more favorable.\n   Microsoft is\u00a0 not using the Google Play ecosystem on Windows, though. Microsoft also isn&#39;t trying to build its own Android ecosystem and is instead partnering with Amazon&#39;s, using the same Amazon App Store that is used on Fire OS devices. Amazon put out\u00a0 a press release, but it doesn&#39;t offer much other than a statement that more details will be released later.\n We haven&#39;t seen a start-to-finish Android app install on Windows 11 yet, so it&#39;s not clear how this all works. Microsoft has released several screenshots showing the Microsoft Store advertising Amazon App Store Android apps. It looks like Amazon&#39;s app catalog is listed inside the Microsoft Store, complete with reviews, screenshots, and a description, but it does not seem like the Microsoft Store can actually install Android apps. The key is in the install button. For Windows apps, it simply says, &#34;Get,&#34; indicating that it will install an app. For Android apps, the button is different. It says, &#34;Get from Amazon App Store,&#34; with a little box and arrow icon, indicating that it will kick you out to an external app.\n    The  Wall Street Journal\u00a0provided additional details of how this works. It sounds like Amazon is going to build an Amazon App Store client for Windows. You&#39;ll need to sign into it with your Amazon account in order to download apps. The Microsoft Store is there for a unified app search and not much else. Presumably, this means you&#39;ll have two App Stores running on Windows all the time, with two places to check for updates. It does not sound streamlined.\n The good news is that if you don&#39;t want to mess with any of this Amazon stuff, Microsoft Engineer  Miguel de Icaza confirmed that Windows 11 will support sideloading. You should immediately have options for open source stores like  F-Droid\u00a0and the ability to load up on  APKMirror apps. I bet it&#39;s only a matter of time before someone gets the full Google Play Store working.\n X86 apps are prevalent on Google Play thanks to years of defaults and pushes for additional architecture support. Is x86 prevalent on the Amazon App Store, though? The Amazon App Store can be sideloaded on any Android device, but the Echo Fire devices that exclusively use Amazon have all been Arm. Lots of apps are universal apps that run on all architectures, so... maybe.\n It would have been nice if Microsoft pulled  a Surface Duo and teamed up with Google to get the actual Play Store in Windows 11. The problem with doing Android outside of the Play Store is that you lose access to the Google Play Services APIs for things like push notifications.

It also serves up glimpses of classic villains the Mandarin and Abomination and a supporting (yet crucial) character from 2016&#39;s  Doctor Strange.\n Directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, this is the first Marvel film to feature an Asian lead\u2014Simu Liu, best known for his role as Jung Kim on the sitcom\u00a0  Kim&#39;s Convenience\u2014as well as a predominantly Asian/Asian diaspora cast and crew.\u00a0Marvel continues to keep plot details tightly under wraps, except to state that the main character gets drawn into the clandestine Ten Rings organization and must confront his past. &#34;Shang-Chi\u2019s main problem in his life is rooted in not knowing who he really is,&#34;  Cretton has said. &#34;He has to learn how to own every part of himself. If he doesn\u2019t allow himself to look at all of it\u2014the good, the bad, the light and the dark\u2014and to own it all, he won\u2019t be able to reach his full potential.&#34;\n The &#34;ten rings&#34; of the title refers to the Marvel Comics supervillain Mandarin&#39;s Ten Rings of Power (worn on the fingers in the comics, shown as arm bracelets in footage from the Marvel film), each with a different feature: ice blasts, flames, or mind-control, for instance.\u00a0As  we&#39;ve reported previously, Marvel created an entirely new character, Wenwu, who has gone by many names over the years, including the Mandarin, who made\u00a0an appearance in  Iron Man 3\u2014or rather, Ben Kingsley played Trevor Slattery, an imposter posing as the Mandarin.\n In addition to Liu, the film stars Awkwafina ( Crazy Rich Asians) as Shang-Chi&#39;s best friend, Katy, and none other than Hong Kong superstar Tony Leung ( Hard Boiled, Chungking Express, Hero, and so on) as his father, Wenwu, aka the Mandarin. Meng&#39;er Zhang plays Xialing, Shang-Chi&#39;s estranged sister; Florian Munteanu ( Creed II, Borderlands) plays Razor Fist; Ronny Chieng ( Crazy Rich Asians, Bliss) plays another pal, Jon Jon; and Fala Chen ( The Undoing) plays Jiang Li. Michelle Yeoh (  Star Trek: Discovery) plays a character named Jiang Nan, having previously played a different MCU role (Aleta Ogord) in   Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. There&#39;s also a masked character dubbed Death Dealer; Marvel has not yet revealed who plays him.\n    Marvel dropped the first teaser in April, which focused on the character&#39;s present life. The teaser featured\u00a0Leung&#39;s voice as the Mandarin in a voiceover, admonishing his son for &#34;wasting&#34; the last ten years. Shang-Chi has been working as a parking valet for a posh hotel in San Francisco when he isn&#39;t hanging out with Katy singing karaoke tunes.\u00a0That carefree existence is about to end. &#34;I trained you so the most dangerous people in the world couldn&#39;t kill you,&#34; the Mandarin continued. &#34;But it&#39;s time for you to take your place by my side. You can&#39;t outrun who you really are.&#34;\n This full trailer delves a bit more deeply into Shang-Chi&#39;s backstory, with another voiceover from Wenwu talking about how the Ten Rings have long conferred power on his family. &#34;If you want them to be yours one day, you have to show me you are strong enough to carry him,&#34; Wenwu tells his son. We learn from Jiang Li that Shang-Chi is a &#34;product of all who came before you, the legacy of your family&#34;\u2014and that includes not just his gentle mother, but also his ruthless father, who Shang-Chi witnessed murder someone when he was a child.\n We get several shots of young Shang-Chi training, interspersed with his present-day battles against assassins\u2014apparently sent by his father to test whether he&#39;s still as formidable as he used to be. We also get to see him channel the Ten Rings&#39; elemental power as he faces off against Wenwu.
