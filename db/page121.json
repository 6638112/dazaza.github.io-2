Whether it\u2019s considering a new restaurant to check out, a movie to see or a product to buy, most people look at reviews before making a final decision. They want social proof as an indicator of quality and relevance.\n  Influencers are a natural byproduct of this desire for social validation, and as social permeates the customer journey, creators have become an essential source of validation and trust. Indeed, social validation is what social platforms are built on, so it\u2019s a significant component of how we derive relevance online \u2014 and the deeper integration of social is changing the dynamic between brands and digital creators.\n  Brand sponsorships are the holy grail for creators hoping to monetize their online influence. According to an  eMarketer report, brand partnerships are still the No. 1 source of revenue for most digital creators.\n However, digital creators have a lot more monetization options to choose from, thanks to Patreon, affiliate platforms, paid content platforms and platform revenue sharing, making it easier to earn a living without relying so heavily on brand sponsorships.\n  Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?  Respond to our survey and help us find the best startup growth marketers!\n  As a result, creators are diversifying their revenue streams, which, for some creators, allows them to be more selective about the brands they work with. What\u2019s more, creators aren\u2019t reliant on just one channel or one form of revenue.\n YouTube creators probably have the most diversified revenue, often combining brand sponsorships, subscription models, affiliate deals, tipping/donations, their line of branded products and revenue share. However, it\u2019s important to note that not all monetization options apply to every creator. But with so many options to choose from, making a living as a digital creator is more accessible than ever.\n  Ad revenue sharing: Advertising is the most traditional form of revenue for online creators. With this model, ads are injected into and around the creator\u2019s content, and they make a certain percentage of revenue based on impressions. However, the revenue split can vary based on the platform, and some platforms have a specific threshold creators must hit before they can participate in ad revenue sharing.\n Affiliate marketing: Similar to advertising or a brand sponsorship, affiliate marketing is an agreement for a share of revenue based on products sold.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed, and Ardius will run as an independent business with the entire team transitioning to Gusto.\n The strategy here is simple: most R&amp;D credits require payroll documentation, data that is already stored in Gusto\u2019s system of record. Ardius in its current incarnation was designed to tap into a number of payroll data providers and extract that data and turn it into verifiable tax documents. With this tie-up, the companies can simply do that automatically for Gusto\u2019s extensive number of customers.\n Joshua Reeves, co-founder and CEO of Gusto, said that the acquisition falls in line with the company\u2019s long-term focus on customers and simplicity. \u201cWe want to bring together technology, great service, [and] make government simpler,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some ways, a lot of stuff we\u2019re doing \u2014 make payroll simpler, make healthcare simpler, make PPP [loans] and tax credits simpler \u2014 just make these things work the way they\u2019re intended to work.\u201d The company presumably could have built out such functionality, but he noted that \u201ctime to market\u201d was a crucial point in making Ardius the company\u2019s first acquisition.\n Tomer London, co-founder and chief product officer, said that \u201cwe\u2019ve been looking at this space for a long time because it kind of connects to one of our original product principles of building a product that is opinionated,\u201d he said. In a space as complicated as HR, \u201cwe want to be out there and be an advisor, not just a tool. And this is just such a great example of where you can take the payroll data that we already have and in just a few clicks and in a matter of a few days, get access to really important cash flow for a business.\u201d He noted that tax credits is \u201csomething that\u2019s been on our roadmap for a long time.\u201d\n Gusto works with more than 100 third-party services that integrate on top of its platform. Reeves emphasized that while Ardius is part of Gusto, all companies \u2014 even those who might compete directly with the product \u2014 will continue to have equal access to the platform\u2019s data. In its release, the company pointed out that Boast.ai, Clarus, Neo.Tax, and TaxTaker are just some of the other tax products that integrate with Gusto today.\n Of course, Ardius is just one of a number of competitors that have popped up in the R&amp;D and economic development tax credit space. MainStreet,  which I last profiled in 2020 for its seed round, just raised $60 million in funding in March led by SignalFire. Meanwhile, Neo.tax,  which I also profiled last year, has raised a total of $5.5 million.\n  Reeves was sanguine about the attention the space is garnering and the potential competition for Ardius. When it comes to R&amp;D tax credits, \u201cwhatever creates more accessibility, we\u2019re a fan of,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s great that there\u2019s more awareness because it\u2019s still under-utilized frankly.\u201d He emphasized that Gusto would be able to offer a more vertically-integrated solution given its data and software than other competitors in the space.\n While the pandemic particularly hit SMBs, who often lacked the financial wherewithal of larger companies to survive the crisis, Gusto actually expanded its business as new companies sprouted up. Reeves said the company grew its customer base 50% in its last fiscal year, which ended in April. It \u201cturns out in a health pandemic and in an economic crisis, things like payroll and accessing health care are quite important,\u201d he said. Gusto  launched a program to help SMBs collect the government\u2019s stimulus PPP loans.\n The company\u2019s main bases of operation are in San Francisco, Denver and  New York City, and the company has a growing contingent of remote workers, including the Ardius crew, who will remain based in LA. While Reeves demurred on future acquisitions, Gusto\u2019s focus on expanding to a comprehensive financial wellness platform for both employees and businesses would likely suggest that additional acquisitions may well be in the offing in the future.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 01:16:40", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6269\u5c55,acquisition", "title":

", "note_en": "This story is available exclusively to Insider subscribers.  Become an Insider and start reading now.\n  For three years until his departure this January, Simon McLaren served as the director of communications for Blade, the urban aviation startup that went public earlier this year at a valuation of more than $800 million. His work in that time was largely what you&#39;d expect of a company spokesperson \u2014 except for the fact that Simon McLaren doesn&#39;t actually exist.\n After Insider sought to verify McLaren&#39;s identity, Blade CEO Rob Wiesenthal admitted in an interview that McLaren was a made-up persona invented by him and his colleagues, and that Wiesenthal masqueraded as McLaren in telephone conversations with news outlets. The ruse lasted for years, duped numerous journalists, and included a puzzling public drama around McLaren&#39;s purported departure from Blade. None of it was real.\n  McLaren has no substantial online presence outside of  a Blade email address, a  Twitter account created last December, and  a Medium profile created last November. His  personal website, created this January, was registered through a proxy, and he uses a 1966 photo of British racing driver Graham Hill across his accounts in place of a profile picture.\n Still, McLaren has been treated as a real human by a variety of news outlets since his apparent debut in the pages of  Vanity Fair in 2018. Serving as the institutional voice of Blade in stories about the company&#39;s compliance with federal regulations, medical supply shuttles, and negotiations with the town of East Hampton, McLaren has been quoted by the  New York Times,\u00a0the  New York Post,  Curbed, the\u00a0 Washington Post,  Fox Business, and  CNN .\n McLaren&#39;s most recent  official press release appears to have been sent out in November 2020, just as Blade began searching for outside representation. But his voice continued to live on in the form of short, opinionated blog posts, called &#34;Simon McLaren&#39;s Curious Content,&#34;  that Blade began sending to subscribers of its email list in October 2020. For twelve weeks, McLaren \u2014 under Blade&#39;s logo \u2014 weighed in on a number of pandemic issues, including  moving to Miami,  meeting over Zoom, and  patronizing New York restaurants.\n  In June, Insider attempted to reach McLaren at a Westchester phone number that he had previously used to call an Insider reporter for  an August 2020 interview, and had been  publicized as belonging to McLaren on the Blade Twitter account in 2019. The call was answered by Lee Gold, Blade&#39;s chief of staff.\n Asked why he was answering McLaren&#39;s phone, Gold said, &#34;I schedule for Simon as well.&#34; He added that he had met McLaren in person and that even though McLaren was no longer on staff at Blade, &#34;he sometimes will do some freelancing for us as a spokesperson.&#34;\n Gold agreed to schedule an interview with McLaren, asking Insider to send a request via email.\u00a0In a follow-up call, Gold said he hadn&#39;t seen McLaren in months and that an email to McLaren&#39;s address had bounced back. He then appeared to block this reporter&#39;s number. Reached again, he declined to answer further questions about McLaren.\n     Soon after, Insider received a call from Rob Wiesenthal, who\u00a0admitted to inventing McLaren. He described the practice of creating false personas and conducting interviews with reporters under false pretenses as a common practice among small companies.\n &#34;As a small company, everyone has to wear many hats. When it was appropriate for a spokesman to respond to a press inquiry, rather than the CEO, given that we did not have a spokesman, we used the pseudonym,&#34; Wiesenthal said. He claimed that, with the exception of McLaren&#39;s name and identity, the spokesman always told the truth. &#34;In the summer of 2020, as a private company we stopped using the press inquiry pseudonym and we now have an outside firm representing us, and we apologize to anyone who feels deceived when we used a pseudonym.&#34;\n The McLaren persona initially started out as a solution to a small, untrained team, Wiesenthal said.\u00a0&#34;I&#39;m the only person who would speak to the press, unless by email directed by me. We just did not have a spokesperson and people had to wear many hats,&#34; he said. &#34;There was no intention of being duplicitous. A lot of people wanted a name for a spokesman, and it was just not appropriate for a CEO to speak. And a lot of people didn&#39;t have training on how to speak with the press. There are a lot of small companies that have done this and continue to do this, but at a certain point you outgrow it, and we outgrew it.&#34;\n Wiesenthal said McLaren&#39;s career as a blogger and newsletter writer was a secondary project that evolved out of the pandemic, in part to keep Blade&#39;s marketing and creative teams busy.\n &#34;During the dark days of Covid, I really think it kept people going,&#34; Wiesenthal said. &#34;We had weeks where nothing was flying during the lockdown. But people wanted to engage and get people to work and communicate with our flyers, we weren&#39;t going to say, &#39;Fly to the airport.&#39; So we wrote interesting things about what life was like in the city.&#34;\n  A former Sony executive and lifelong New Yorker, Wiesenthal stepped down as the chief operating officer of Warner Music to launch Blade in 2015. The company, which describes itself as an &#34;urban air mobility platform&#34; and brokers flights on helicopters and chartered jets, attracted investments from heavyweights like Barry Diller and David Geffen before going public by merging with a    SPAC  earlier this year. It now trades on the Nasdaq.\n The SPAC deal coincided with McLaren&#39;s official exit from Blade. In January 2021, just a few weeks after the company tapped the communications firm ICR to announce the merger, Blade sent out an unusual letter to subscribers explaining that McLaren would be leaving the company, and taking the newsletter with him, in part because he could no longer abide Blade&#39;s attempts to edit his views.\n &#34;We are living in a uniquely polarizing time,&#34; the statement said. &#34;As such, despite how much we enjoy Simon McLaren&#39;s Curious Content and his unique perspective on what it&#39;s like to be a diehard New Yorker in this day and age, both Simon and the Company have decided that it&#39;s best that we part ways and transition his weekly newsletter from Blade to him.&#34;\n     The letter quoted McLaren explaining that he was no longer an appropriate spokesperson for Blade. &#34;My weekly dispatches have little interest to me or my readers unless they create emotion \u2014 laughter or perhaps annoyance, and at times, happiness or even unexpected animus. I appreciate the platform Blade has given me, but I am at the point in my life where I have little interest in Blade, or its partners, bleaching my prose in an effort to avoid any readers potentially being triggered by my views. Over the past few weeks, Blade&#39;s editing process has created the literary equivalent of melba toast. Simply put, my views are not subject to negotiation.&#34;\n Wiesenthal said the drama around McLaren&#39;s seemingly rocky departure started as an &#34;inside joke&#34; among the company&#39;s creative team.\n Whether he exists or not, McLaren was certainly on the money about one thing: In January, he predicted that stories about well known public figures pretending to be someone they were not would be big in 2021.\n &#34;Given the giant void created by our departing president, news outlets will be starving for stories to report on. How inconsequential a story will the media be willing to cover?&#34; he wrote. &#34;Well, consider this. How many stories have you read in the past 72 hours about the allegedly fake Spanish accent of Alec Baldwin&#39;s wife? Yes, that&#39;s a story that will qualify for &#39;above the fold&#39; status in 2021.&#34;\n  Sign up for notifications from Insider!

The study was published in the   Journal of Aging Studies.\n Researchers from the university separated respondents into three groups, based on age. One group was younger people, between the ages of 18 and 29, another group of senior citizens whose average age was 72, and a third group made up of individuals whose average age was 88.\n Each of the groups reached a majority consensus that they would not want to live forever. However, among the youngest group and oldest group there were differences in what age they would prefer to be &#34;frozen&#34; at by a theoretical immortality pill.\n  &#34;Younger-old and older-old adults indicated that they would prefer to live permanently at an older age than younger adults,&#34; the study reported.\n The youngest group had the largest number of individuals saying they would want to live forever, with 34 per cent saying they would take an immortality pill. Another 40 per cent said they would not take one, and 26 per cent said they were unsure.\n The middle group saw slightly fewer people willing to live forever, with 32 per cent saying they would take the pill, and 43 per cent saying they would not.

See our  ethics statement.\n Capcom games like   Resident Evil 4  and   Devil May Cry allegedly used unlicensed copyrighted photos extensively in its games to build out environments, details, and even the  Resident Evil  4 logo, according to a new lawsuit filed Friday.\n Designer Judy A. Juracek filed her initial complaint in a Connecticut court on Friday. In the lawsuit, she alleged that Capcom used photos from her copyrighted book,  Surfaces, in multiple games, including  Resident Evil  4,  Devil May Cry, and other Capcom games.  Surfaces is a collection of 1,200 photographs of textures that Juracek photographed herself; the book is intended to be used for \u201cvisual research\u201d for artists, architects, and designers,  according to the book\u2019s description. It was originally published in 1996. The collection comes with a CD-ROM of the images \u2014 but Juracek said she requires people to license images from her for commercial use by contacting her directly. Juracek said in the lawsuit that Capcom never contacted her for a license.\n Juracek pointed out at least 80 photographs that are used in different scenarios across Capcom\u2019s games, with more than 100 pages of documentation. One instance called out in the lawsuit is regarding a shattered glass texture used in the  Resident Evil 4 logo.\n   Juracek said she took the photo of glass in Italy. \u201cIt is hard to imagine that Juracek would take a photo of shattered glass in Italy and interior mansion door design and that Capcom artists would reproduce the exact same pattern of shattered glass in a logo and interior design without benefit of Juracek\u2019s photographs,\u201d she said in the lawsuit.\n In more than 100 pages of supporting case documents, Juracek pointed out more than 200 instances of her photographs allegedly being used in Capcom\u2019s games. This includes everything from marbled textures to ornate sculptural details that are recognizable and abundant in Capcom games.\n   Part of Juracek\u2019s evidence comes from the  2020 Capcom data breach, which happened in November. In that leak,   Resident Evil Village\u2019s launch plans were prematurely revealed, and personal information for hundreds of thousands of people had been compromised, including customers, shareholders, and employees, Capcom said. Capcom reportedly received a ransom note in the attack, before information was leaked online. That information included some \u201chigh resolution images of artwork used in Resident Evil and other games,\u201d Juracek said.\n \u201cThe file names for at least one of the images from the Capcom hacked files are the same file names as those used on the [ Surfaces] CD-ROM,\u201d she alleged. The lawsuit shows a metal texture that was labeled \u201cME009\u201d on Juracek\u2019s CD-ROM, and labeled the same in the Capcom folders.\n   In the lawsuit, Juracek noted that Capcom was also  recently accused of copying Dutch filmmaker Richard Raaphorst\u2019s monster designs for the new  Resident Evil Village game. Raaphorst found out about the allegedly stolen design after fans contacted him about one of the characters from his film  Frankenstein\u2019s Army being the basis for Village\u2019s propeller-headed bad guy, Sturm,  he told Eurogamer.\n Juracek\u2019s lawyers are asking the court to award her up to $12 million in damages on a count of copyright infringement.

", "note_en": "Google said Thursday it&#39;s funding a project to increase  Linux security by writing parts of the operating system&#39;s core in the  Rust programming language, a modernization effort that could bolster the security of the internet and  smartphones.\n If the project succeeds, it&#39;ll be possible to add new elements written in Rust into the heart of Linux, called the kernel. Such a change would mark a major technological and cultural shift for an open-source software project that&#39;s become foundational to Google&#39;s Android and Chrome operating systems as well as vast swaths of the internet.\n   Miguel Ojeda, who&#39;s written software used by the  Large Hadron Collider particle accelerator and worked on programming language security, is being contracted to write software in  Rust for the Linux kernel. Google is paying for the contract, which is being extended through the  Internet Security Research Group, a nonprofit that&#39;s also made it easier to  secure website communications through the  Let&#39;s Encrypt effort.\n Adding Rust modules to the Linux kernel would improve security by closing some avenues for hackers can use to attack phones, computers or servers. Since it was launched in 1991, Linux has been written solely in the powerful but old  C programming language. The language was developed in 1972 and is more vulnerable to hacks than contemporary programming languages.\n Better security for Linux is good news for everyone but hackers. In addition to the Android and Chrome OSes, Google services like YouTube and Gmail all rely on servers running Linux. It also powers Amazon and Facebook, and is a fixture in  cloud computing services.\n It isn&#39;t clear if Linux kernel leaders will accommodate Rust. Linus Torvalds, the founder of Linux, has said he&#39;s  open to change if  Rust for Linux champions prove its worth. Ojeda has proposed 13  changes needed to allow Rust modules in Linux to get things started.\n Google already has taken some early steps to make it possible to  use Rust for Linux Android. Getting buy-in at the highest levels of the Linux kernel project means many other software projects could benefit, too.\n Google credits the Linux community programmers who began the Rust for Linux project. &#34;The community had already done and continues to do great work toward adding Rust support to the Linux kernel build system,&#34; Google said in a blog post.\n  Rust, which was developed by Firefox maker  Mozilla and is now run by the independent  Rust Foundation, makes it safer for software to write to memory.  Hackers can exploit memory problems, hiding malicious extra code in out-of-bounds memory areas. Rust checks for those and other problems when programmers are building their software. And it&#39;s been the  most loved programming language for five years running in Stack Overflow&#39;s annual developer survey.\n &#34;Rust represents the  best alternative to C and C++ currently available,&#34; Microsoft&#39;s security team concluded in 2019. The team said Rust would have prevented memory problems at fault in 70% of its significant security issues. And because Rust&#39;s checks happen while software is being built, the safety doesn&#39;t come at the expense of performance when the software is running.\n The goal of the Linux on Rust project isn&#39;t to replace all of Linux&#39;s C code but rather to improve selective and new parts.\n &#34;For the foreseeable future we plan to focus on certain security critical components and drivers,&#34; said Josh Aas, who runs ISRG&#39;s Prossimo project to move critical Internet software to memory safe software. Drivers are operating systems modules that control specific devices like printers, network adapters and graphics chips.\n Google isn&#39;t placing its only bets on Linux and Rust. It&#39;s got its own memory-safe language, Go, and a  new operating system called Fuchsia it&#39;s begun  using in its Nest Hub smart screen.\n &#34;Google has a variety of other investments in languages, tools, and platforms,&#34; a company spokesman said. &#34;Having multiple solutions to related but not necessarily overlapping problems allows for a cross pollination of good ideas to be reused.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-18 01:08:15", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "linux,rust,google,\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf,\u8c37\u6b4c", "title": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u6b63\u5728\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d44\u91d1\u6765\u589e\u52a0Linux\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Rust\u4e2d\u5199\u4f5c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6838\u5fc3 ", "title_en": "Google says it is funding a project to increase Linux security by writing parts of the operating system's core in Rust", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cnet.com/news/google-backed-linux-project-could-make-android-chrome-os-harder-to-hack/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["linux", "rust", "google", "\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf", "\u8c37\u6b4c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1066516, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u5929\uff0c\u968f\u5904\u53ef\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u73b0\u5728\u719f\u6089\u7684\u719f\u6089\u7535\u52a8\u677fCutoutdogs\u3002\u5750\u7740 - \u6c38\u8fdc\u7684\u8b66\u62a5 - \u751a\u81f3\u6700\u957f\u7684\u4f1a\u8bdd\uff0c\u4ece\u672a\u5206\u5fc3\u548c\u865a\u6784\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u3002\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u884c\u4e1a\u6b20\u722a\u5b50 - \u5757\u8425\u9500\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u6770\u514b\u548c\u4e0d\u77e5\u6570\u3002\u5df2\u7ecf\u62a5\u9053\u4e86\u6765\u81ea\u5927\u5b66\u8d5b\u6e38\u620f\u4e1a\u52a1\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u8d85\u7ea7\u8d5b\u4e8b\uff0c\u5145\u6c14\u6027\u73a9\u5177\u662f\u7eb8\u677f\u72d7\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u7eb8\u7bb1 - \u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6211\u7684\u53e3\u5473\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f3c\u4e4e\u5448\u73b0\u4e86\u6c38\u4e45\u6027\u7684\u60ca\u4eba\uff0c\u4ee5\u67d0\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bfc\u81f4\u6211\u6000\u7591\u6211\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u60ac\u5782\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6307\u9488\u6216\u4e00\u4e9b\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u3002\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u8bd5\u56fe\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u573a\u9e66\u9e49\uff0c\u91d1\u96c0\u9c7c\u60f3\u8c61\u4e2d\u7684\u516d\u82f1\u5c3a\u9ad8\u7684\u767d\u8272\u5154\u5b50 - \u4f46\u662f\u4e00\u4e9b\u4ee4\u4eba\u8ba8\u538c\u7684\u54c8\u5e0c\u8868\u7bb1\u7684\u5fae\u5999\u7684\u9e66\u9e49\u6765\u8c08\u8bba\u56de\u6765\u7684\u9e66\u9e49\uff0c\u4e00\u53ea\u91d1\u9c7c\u8c01\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u5ba1\u8bae\u7684\u76f8\u53cd\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u6e38\u6cf3 - \u6216\u7a7a\u6905\u5b50 - \u7f3a\u4e4f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u4e13\u5fc3\u91cd\u70b9\uff0c\u8ba9\u6211\u89e3\u91ca\u6211\u7684\u5973\u6027\u679c\u7136\u540e\u73a9\u7f51\u653b\u51fb\u3002 Microsoft Inc\u63d0\u4f9b\u52a8\u753b\u72d7\uff08Orgod\u7981\u6b62\uff0c\u8df3\u821e\u7eb8\u5939\uff09\u7684\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5c4f\u5e55\u6a2a\u6746\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u76f4\u4ee4\u4eba\u5931\u671b\u3002\u9664\u975e\u60a8\u5728\u5e15\u65af\u5361\u5199\u4f5c\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u907f\u514d\u8d35\u91cd\u72ac\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u54c1\u79cd\uff09\u3002 Shitzu\uff06\uff0339;

Sitting - forever alert - never distracted and virtuallymaintenance free throughout even the longest sessions. Trulythe software industry owes a lot to Jake and the unsungheroes at the Poochie-Chunks marketting department. It has been reported from some of the racier parts of thecomputer games business that inflatable sex toys aresupplanting the cardboard dog as the Walkthroughee ofchoice - but for my tastes, they seem to present alook of perpetual suprise which somehow leads me to suspectthat I have a dangling pointer or some such. Others have attempted to use live Parrots, Goldfishor imaginary six-foot tall white rabbits - but somehowexplaining the subtleties of an unwrapped hash tablelookup to a Parrot that talks back, a Goldfish whois swimming in the opposite direction at the criticalmoment - or an empty chair - lacks the necessarydisciplinary focus to keep me explaining my coderather then playing net-hack. Efforts by Microsoft Inc to provide an animated dog (orGod forbid, a Dancing Paper-Clip) as an on-screenWalkthroughee have been disappointingly ineffective. Unless you are writing in Pascal, steer clear of Poodles(especially the smaller breeds). Shitzu&#39;s and Pugs arepoor for Object-Oriented code. Yappy dogs in generalare to be avoided since thay are at best annoying -and have been reported in the literature as being particularlypoor at detecting off-by-one errors and misplaced parentheses. The calm face of a Labrador - or for some, a CockerSpaniel - fits the need for a steadying influence. A calm,understanding demeanor and nice, droopy ears.

Today\u2019s transaction represents the largest investment in a private database company and raises Neo4j\u2019s valuation to over $2 billion.\n  Existing investors  One Peak (an investor since 2018),  Creandum (an investor since 2014), and  Greenbridge Partners (an investor since 2016), as well as new investors  DTCP and  Lightrock, also participated.\n   Emil Eifrem, Neo4j\u2019s CEO and Co-Founder, characterized the news as an inflection point in the broader database market and welcomed investment partners Eurazeo, GV, DTCP, and Lightrock.\n  \u201cDatabases constitute the largest single market in enterprise software, with growth centered in new generations of databases that address today\u2019s data challenges in unprecedented ways,\u201d said Eifrem. \u201cThis is a magical time in databases, presenting an opportunity for a handful of generational companies to emerge as leaders in the broader landscape. Neo4j is one of these companies, and today\u2019s record-breaking transaction in the database space demonstrates that our new and existing investors share this belief.\u201d\n  According to Gartner, &#34;By 2025, graph technologies will be used in 80% of data and analytics innovations, up from 10% in 2021, facilitating rapid decision making across the enterprise.\u201d Source: Gartner, Top Trends in Data and Analytics for 2021, Rita Sallam et al., 16 Feb 2021.\n  Trusted by more than 800 enterprise customers, including  Adobe,  AstraZeneca,  eBay,\u00a0  Levi Strauss &amp; Co.,  UBS,  Volvo Cars, and  Walmart, Neo4j is the world\u2019s most widely deployed graph database.\n  Used by more than  75% of the Fortune 100, Neo4j\u2019s graph data platform enables mission-critical workloads for the world\u2019s largest connected data applications.\n  Neo4j\u2019s market leadership is  accelerating along several axes. Today\u2019s funding fuels the company\u2019s product innovation to provide graph technology that  far exceeds the most demanding customer requirements across data science, machine learning, cloud deployment, and real-time performance.\n    Cloud portfolio \u2013 Delivering a portfolio of multi-cloud services that can serve individual developers all the way through to the largest global enterprises, offering unmatched flexibility, agility, and performance at any scale.\n  Graph data science \u2013 Powering a new era of intelligent applications with enhanced machine learning models to unlock otherwise unattainable predictions based on relationships.\n  Market reach \u2013 Expanding Neo4j\u2019s global footprint, and growing the company\u2019s ecosystem of complementary technologies and expert service providers, in order to deliver complete solutions and accelerate customer success.\n  Nathalie Kornhoff-Br\u00fcls is a Managing Director in the growth team of Eurazeo and has been appointed to the Neo4j Board of Directors.\n  \u201cIt is clear that the world is becoming increasingly interconnected, from multi-level global supply chains to ubiquitous automation of processes. It is also clear that businesses who are unable to digitize, analyze, and visualize this interconnectedness will be left behind,\u201d said Kornhoff-Br\u00fcls. \u201cWe chose to invest in Neo4j because it is shaping the future of how data and analytics will need to be implemented in the enterprise and beyond. The company\u2019s technology leadership, global developer community, and world-class customer base \u2013 combined with an ever-expanding global ecosystem \u2013 uniquely position Neo4j to continue to define and lead the graph database category. We couldn\u2019t be prouder to have been chosen as a partner by Emil and his team, and look forward to leveraging Eurazeo\u2019s global platform for the company\u2019s journey ahead.\u201d\n  General Partners  Erik Nordlander and  Tom Hulme welcomed Neo4j to the GV portfolio, in a  blog post titled Neo4j: A Quest to Make Better Sense of Data.\n  \u201cTom Hulme and I are excited to welcome the team to the portfolio, joining other database companies that are building the future of the enterprise. Neo4j has been steadfast in its vision, and I admire Emil\u2019s grit and tireless dedication over the years to build and evangelize graph databases,\u201d said Erik Nordlander, General Partner at GV.\n  As the graph category creator, Neo4j has built a global community of hundreds and thousands of highly skilled application developers and data scientists around its technology ecosystem. These practitioners are building wide-ranging applications, unable to be served by relational or other NoSQL databases, which require digitizing connections in data at scale. Examples include determining the price of an airline ticket in real time, exposing complex criminal networks responsible for cyber attacks, and money laundering activity.\r Neo4j is recognized as a Leader in The Forrester Wave\u2122: Graph Data Platforms, Q4 2020. Of the 12 graph data platform providers cited, Neo4j achieved the highest scores in the current offering and strategy categories.\n  For more information about what Neo4j\u2019s funding announcement means to its customers, the developer community, and the database industry, view Emil Eifrem\u2019s blog post,  Neo4j Raises the Largest Funding Round in Database History.\n    Neo4j is the leader in graph database technology.

", "note_en": "Each forum shard contains 900 million relationships and 182 million nodes. The person shard contains 3 billion people and 16 billion relationships between them.\n  \u201c100 machines isn\u2019t cool. You know what\u2019s cool? One trillion relationships.\u201d\n I\u2019m not saying that someone actually uttered these exact words, but I\u2019m pretty sure we all thought them. That was a month ago, when we\u2019d decided to try and build the biggest graph database that has ever existed.\n   When we introduced  Neo4j Fabric, we also created a  proof of concept benchmark that was presented at FOSDEM 2020.\n It showed that, for a  1TB database, throughput and latency  improve linearly with the number of shards that it\u2019s distributed across. More shards, more performance.\n  The results looked good and confirmed that we had a very good understanding of the approach to scaling a graph database. Development of Fabric continued toward making it an integral part of Neo4j.\n New technologies were created and improved upon (server-side routing is a good example) and made useful for non-Fabric setups as well.\n But, that 1TB dataset from FOSDEM was always nagging us.  1TB is not that big, at least for Neo4j. We routinely have production setups with 10TB or more and, although they run on considerably large machines, Neo4j scales up pretty well.\n We didn\u2019t really need a solution for that; we needed a solution for  really big databases. That\u2019s why we had created Fabric, but we hadn\u2019t found its limit yet.\n And what would that scale be? A year ago we built clusters of 40 machines, and they worked out pretty well. Going to 100 machines didn\u2019t seem that much of a challenge. Billions of nodes, perhaps? Well, billions of nodes is the same as a few TB of data.\n Plus, the  richness of a graph schema comes from relationships between nodes, not the nodes themselves. Remember: We\u2019re trying to see how far we can push Neo4j, not just make ourselves feel or look good.\n Every now and then the same discussion would come around, and it was becoming clear that we were looking for an opportunity, a lightning rod, that would ground us in a realistic goal.\n Turns out, that opportunity was  NODES 2021 on June 17, our biggest online developer conference.\n  We decided that we needed to show the world what we mean when we talk about scale. Not  just that Neo4j can retain or even improve performance when scaled horizontally, but to show how far we can go while still retaining performance.\n We\u2019re going to need bigger numbers. Something that demands attention. Not hundreds of machines or billions of nodes.\n   Where do you even find a database with a trillion relationships? Using a production setup would present logistics problems \u2014 the data transfer itself would be complicated, not to mention obfuscating the data so it\u2019s appropriate for public view.  We\u2019ll need to generate it for ourselves, from a known model. And we knew we needed to start with the data model, since that would give us the number and size of machines, the queries we\u2019d run, and the tests we\u2019d create.  In short, start with the data model to get a sense of the effort it would take.\n LDBC is a good candidate. It is a social network that contains people, forums, and posts. It\u2019s easy to understand and explain and we are very familiar with it. We decided on  3 billion people, surpassing the largest social network on the planet. The degree of social connectivity was chosen so that the person shard would come out 850GB, and every forum shard would come at 250GB with about 900 million relationships each.  To get to the target of 1 trillion relationships we\u2019d need about  1110 forum shards in total, each its own machine.\n  That\u2019s 1110 forum shards, plus a few more for redundancy, each of which will need to have a store generated for it.\n We also wanted 3  Fabric proxies connecting to 10, 100 and all the shards to see how the system scales as data sizes grow. And, with the clock ticking, we needed a plan to orchestrate all these machines.\n It was all about managing risk. We expected that, if trouble found us, it would be either during store generation or something glitching badly in the network. As it turned out, we were half right.\n   One was the  large number of machines that would host the shards. The other was generating the shard data, which we knew needed to happen in parallel and would, therefore, also need orchestrating a lot of machines.\n We needed a two-step approach. The first step would be full-sized stores but a small number of Neo4j processes. That would let us test the parallel store creation, the generators, the installation of the stores from the buckets to the shards, and also test the MVP of the latency-measuring client.\n It wouldn\u2019t put any stress on our orchestration tools (that would come later), and allows us to focus on getting everything wired properly for our proof of concept. Things worked out pretty well, and we had all the pieces in place. Everything seemed to work together, and now we could hold our breath and go for the second phase \u2014 full size.\n With two weeks left, we moved to step two:   We pulled out all the stops and braced for impact.\n The first issue that came up was that AWS instance provisioning started failing unpredictably at around 800 machines. Some detective work led to discovering that we have a vCore limit on our AWS account that didn\u2019t let us create any more machines. AWS Support lifted it promptly and we continued creating instances only to hit a more serious limitation:\n \u201cWe currently do not have sufficient x1e.4xlarge capacity in zones with support for \u2018gp2\u2019 volumes. Our system will be working on provisioning additional capacity.\u201d\n Hmm. It would seem   Amazon had run out of capacity. This left us with two options. Either go for multiple Availability Zones or for smaller instance types. We decided that there\u2019s more complexity and unknowns going for multi AZ, so we\u2019d do smaller instances for now and, if performance was a problem, we\u2019d deal with it later. Getting to the full number of instances was the most important goal.\n Using smaller instances did the trick, and the next day we had the full contingent of 1129 shards up and running. The latency measuring demo app was almost ready so we decided to take some measurements to see where we stand.\n  The complete fabric proxy, the one pointing to all 1129 shards, was timing out. Neo4j log files didn\u2019t have any relevant error messages, just the timeouts. No GC pauses, no firewall misconfigurations; none of the usual suspects were to blame. Each individual shard was responding normally, and the Fabric proxy didn\u2019t show any problems either. It took an evening of investigative work to find that the issue was   DNS query limiting. As AWS documentation points out:\n \u201cAmazon provided DNS servers enforce a limit of 1024 packets per second per elastic network interface (ENI). Amazon provided DNS servers reject any traffic exceeding this limit.\u201d\n Yup. That should do it. Our Fabric configuration was using DNS names for the shards, so that limit was reached immediately on every query we submitted. The solution was quite simple \u2014 just make the DNS entries static on the Fabric instance and no longer depend on DNS ( /etc/hosts FTW).\n And that was the last limit we had to overcome. Our initial latency numbers were looking very nice and we decided there was no reason to move to larger instance types, which would also help keep the costs reasonable.\n Overall, we had build tools that allowed us, at the press of a button, to set up a  1129 shard cluster hosting 280 TB of data, with 3 Fabric proxies, in under 3 hours. Yay! And it took us only 16 days to get there.\n We spent the rest of the time fine-tuning the configurations and the queries, and trying out the latency measuring app. We also played around with the graph itself, created new ad-hoc queries to get a feel of working with such a large setup.\n     We didn\u2019t want to create a pure demo-ware, so we decided to make everything public under the ASL, you can try to run the setup yourself (at different scales) by using the   trillion-graph repository. Just remember to watch your AWS bill \ud83d\udcb8!\n   This is just the first step in a long journey. We have a lot more work to do to understand how large graph databases behave, how network variations aggregate as noise and how we should improve the system to scale beyond the numbers we achieved for this demo.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 01:06:47", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6570\u636e\u5e93,database,\u521b\u5efa,creating", "title":

", "note_en": "CloudFlare delivers great DNS speeds worldwide and they have a really well designed control panel for managing DNS hosting, combine that with a premium free service and you get a powerful and very attracting DNS hosting solution for bloggers, webshop owners, and anyone else who owns a website. However, what most people overlook is that CloudFlare, in the name of security, every day blocks millions of valid users from visiting the websites that CloudFlare has registered in their hosting service.\n In the control panel for DNS setup you have an option called &#34;Firewall&#34;, and within that option there is a setting called &#34;Security level&#34;.\n  By default it is set to &#34;Medium&#34;, which means that a lot of people will be blocked from your website by a very annoying and time consuming CAPTCHA. And the problem with this option is that it  cannot be disabled in the free service. You actually has to pay for the Enterprise edition, which is more that 200 dollars a month per domain, in order to disable the feature. Even if you set the setting to the lowest available value in the free service, which is  Essentially off, many of your visitors will still be blocked.\n   The CAPTCHA may look harmless enough, but often it gets repeated several times displaying different puzzles to solve. Many times a fadeout effect has been inserted when you click on a picture and the picture takes about 3-4 seconds before it vanishes only to be replaced by yet another picture. The process is extremely annoying and many people will simply leave your website.\n The demand for privacy on the Internet is growing rapidly and every day more and more people are signing up for VPN services around the world. These services are often blocked by default by CloudFlare and this is a serious problem.\n Here&#39;s an example on YouTube on how annoying it can be if you&#39;re using a VPN service and an anti-tracking plug-in for Firefox:\n  The CAPTCHA solution that CloudFlare throws in the face of people has absolutely nothing to do with security and it will never block anyone with an evil intent from achieving whatever they want on your website. Professional hackers has huge botnets to work from, botnets consisting of thousands of compromised computer world wide with very different IP addresses. There is no way CloudFlare can protect your website with their stupid CAPTCHA, the only thing they can do is to block and harrash people who value privacy from visiting your website. You need to understand this well if you value your visitors.\n Nobody wants to fill out an annoying CAPTCHA just to visit your website, no matter what you have to offer. And just as rapidly growing as CloudFlare is, just as rapidly do people boycott websites that are using the CloudFlare DNS hosting solution.\n Take a look at the  Block Cloudflare MITM Attack Firefox plug-in. This plug-in will block your website completely if you&#39;re using CloudFlare and it is a highly recommended plug-in.\n  Another very serious problem with CloudFlare is that they act as a  MITM (man-in-the-middle) with their CDN (content delivery network) service in which they, amongst other things, cache your website content and display that to your visitors. If you&#39;re running a normal website, like a blog, many times people will never actually visit your website, they&#39;ll just get the content from CloudFlare. However, this is not the serious problem, the serious problem is that they provide SSL connections for all who use their service in a way that they become a man-in-the-middle. Your connection is only really encrypted up until the CloudFlare servers, after that the connection can simply be clear text. The connection is encrypted between the browser and CloudFlare, and between CloudFlare and the website if the website has a SSL certificate, but the communication in-between remains completely visible to CloudFlare.\n You can check this by going to any website that uses a CloudFlare&#39;s SSL connection. Check the certificate for the website. You&#39;ll notice that it&#39;s a CloudFlare certificate and not a certificate for the website you&#39;re actually visiting.\n  Imagine B as your browser and S as the webserver. In a normal communication flow it would look like this:\n  When you visit a website with a SSL connection, your browser (B) checks the encryption certificate and if it validates, an encrypted connection is established between your browser (B) and the webserver (S). Now imagine that we setup another computer in between your browser and the webserver.\n  In this setup both the computer in the middle (C) and the webserver has a SSL certificate. When your browser requests an encrypted connection to the website, it gets the certificate from the computer in the middle, in this case CloudFlare, then an encrypted communication is established between these two. Then the computer in the middle does the same with the webserver, and an encrypted connection is established between the computer in the middle and the webserver. However, the computer in the middle now sees everthing.\n Let&#39;s say you click on something on the website. The &#34;click&#34; gets encrypted in the SSL communication and send to the computer, then the computer in the middle decrypts the communication and sees the address of the &#34;click&#34;, it then encrypts the communication again and sends it to the webserver, which again decrypts the communication in order to deliver the content of your &#34;click&#34;.\n So do you really want CloudFlare to snatch the communication between your website and your visitors or customers? CloudFlare will be able to see everything even when you have a SSL certificate running on your webserver.\n You need to understand that users, the visitors to your website, are being mislead by the padlock icon that falsely state that the connection to your website is secure. Users believe, when they see the padlock icon, that the have a secure end-to-end tunnel to your website, while they unwittingly have a tunnel to CloudFlare, who sees all the trafic before it reaches your website.\n  It means that sensitive data is being disclosed to CloudFlare without the consent or knowledge of your visitors.\n   If you&#39;re looking for DDoS mitigation, use basically any of the providers that offer it on a network level - it&#39;s really not necessary to have access to HTTP traffic to mitigate attacks. Also, don&#39;t run Apache - it&#39;s notoriously vulnerable to various low-bandwidth attacks.\n A non-exhaustive list of &#34;real&#34; mitigation providers (note that I am not making any particular recommendations):\n  You&#39;ll want to avoid anything HTTP-specific (as it will be prone to the same privacy issues as CloudFlare), and opt for layer 3/4 mitigation only. Another option, if you&#39;re running at a larger scale, is to purchase mitigation appliances and just set up your own mitigation infrastructure. This will not be cheap and require some serious connectivity, but beyond a certain point it&#39;ll be more cost-effective. If you&#39;re looking for a WAF, run one on your own backend server(s) and/or loadbalancer(s). There&#39;s no benefit to doing this remotely, really. Even something relatively simple like ModSecurity will cover a wide array of problems.\n If you&#39;re looking to save bandwidth: don&#39;t bother. Traffic costs virtually nothing nowadays, and saving a few dollars by having another provider cache your assets hardly outweighs having the privacy (and potentially security) of all your users compromised. If you find traffic to be expensive, you should probably look for a different provider - some providers (like AWS) notoriously overcharge for it.\n If you&#39;re looking for better performance: CloudFlare doesn&#39;t really provide that to begin with. There&#39;s an extra hop for non-static assets, and depending on the location of your server and users, it can actually slow things down. If your performance is really critical to the millisecond - and chances are, it isn&#39;t - look into hosting providers that offer anycast.\n If you&#39;re looking for DNS hosting: plenty of options. Many providers offer it for free if you host with them, Hurricane Electric offers it for free regardless of where you are hosted, and if you need an SLA, there&#39;s Rage4 and Route 53. Pretty much every DNS hosting provider uses anycast.\n If you&#39;re looking for magic SSL/TLS: Use Caddy  https://caddyserver.com/, which is a HTTPd that will automatically set up and renew certificates for you through  Let&#39;s Encrypt, as well as greatly simplifying TLS configuration. It&#39;s essentially zero-effort.\n Trying to outsource this to a third party (like CloudFlare&#39;s &#34;Universal SSL/TLS&#34; does) defeats the point - it means that the third party can see all of your traffic, all the while providing a false sense of security to your users. They see the padlock, but their traffic is not secured end-to-end.\n   If you want to block CloudFlare websites in your browser you can do so by the Firefox plug-in called  Block CloudFlare plug-in\n   If you have any comments or corrections please feel free to email them to me.

"note_en": "Last week, El Salvador\u2019s government  passed a law to accept bitcoin as legal tender alongside the US dollar. The country receives $6 billion in remittances per year\u2014nearly a quarter of its gross domestic product\u2014and the hope is that bitcoin\u2019s lower transaction costs could boost that amount by a few percentage points.\n  The move was first proposed by the country\u2019s president, Nayib Bukele, who said he hoped that in addition to facilitating lower remittance fees, the bitcoin plan would attract investment and provide an avenue for savings for residents, about 70 percent of whom are unbanked. (What Bukele didn\u2019t say, but what Bloomberg has  reported, is that he and members of his political party have owned bitcoin for years.) Adding the cryptocurrency to the roster isn\u2019t a simple task, though, and the new law gives the country just three months to roll the plan out nationwide. No country has ever used bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency as legal tender, and challenges abound. To address those concerns, El Salvador turned to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund for assistance; the latter is currently considering a $1.3 billion  financing request from the country.\n The IMF offered a guarded assessment of El Salvador\u2019s bitcoin move, with spokesperson Gerry Rice saying at a  press briefing, \u201cAdoption of bitcoin as legal tender raises a number of macroeconomic, financial, and legal issues that require very careful analysis.\u201d\n The World Bank was less generous. \u201cWe are committed to helping El Salvador in numerous ways, including for currency transparency and regulatory processes,\u201d a World Bank spokesperson told  Reuters. \u201cWhile the government did approach us for assistance on bitcoin, this is not something the World Bank can support given the environmental and transparency shortcomings.\u201d\n    In other words, bitcoin\u2019s  energy demands and its ease of use in money laundering, tax evasion, and other illegal schemes makes the cryptocurrency a no-go in the eyes of the World Bank.\n   There are other reasons the World Bank and the IMF may be skeptical of El Salvador\u2019s bid to use bitcoin. The technical challenges aren\u2019t insignificant. For one, bitcoin\u2019s price relative to the dollar has been highly volatile. How do you price a dozen eggs in bitcoin if the price of bitcoin fluctuates 10 percent in a few hours? Perhaps the answer is that you don\u2019t. In the \u201cBitcoin Beach\u201d of El Zonte, El Salvador, where bitcoin use is relatively widespread, merchants  still price their goods in dollars, and the exchange rate is set at the time of purchase. That approach  appears to be what the El Salvadoran government is taking, but it treats bitcoin more as a token than a true currency. \u00a0 Second, bitcoin transactions can be notoriously slow. Each must be verified by miners, and miners only process blocks of transactions, not individual ones. So for a purchase in bitcoin to be confirmed, both parties have to wait for the block to be completed. Currently, one block takes about 10 minutes to be added to the blockchain, though  in El Zonte, one merchant said transactions are confirmed in her local app in about two minutes. Various projects are working to improve the transaction speed, but they\u2019re not part of bitcoin proper yet.\n Lastly, while bitcoin transactions could be inexpensive or even free, they do tend to have a fee attached to them. Fees aren\u2019t required, but they do entice miners to verify a transaction. Plus, should Salvadorans want to exchange their bitcoin for dollars, there are charges associated with that, too. So while the move could save on remittance fees, which run about 3 percent, the system won\u2019t be costless.\n El Salvador could still pull off the move without help from the World Bank or the IMF, but it will be that much more challenging. And the clock is ticking. Unless businesses don\u2019t have access to the technology required, they\u2019ll have to accept bitcoin by September 7, 2021.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 00:30:13", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01,\u4e0b\u964d,bank,\u6cd5\u5f8b", "title": "\u4e16\u754c\u94f6\u884c\u62a8\u51fb\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\uff0c\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u8428\u5c14\u74e6\u591a\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u76ee ", "title_en": "World Bank slams bitcoin, declines to help El Salvador\u2019s cryptocurrency plan", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/world-bank-slams-bitcoin-declines-to-help-el-salvadors-cryptocurrency-plan/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01", "\u4e0b\u964d", "bank", "\u6cd5\u5f8b"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "96dbf4e0ec5ae30f4059f4962e8c38d6.png", "infoid": 1066509, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u672c\u5468\uff0c\u5fae\u8f6f\u548cBethesda\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c\u661f\u9645\u57df\u5c06\u5728\u660e\u5e74\u5b8c\u5168\u6765\u5230Xbox\u7cfb\u5217X / S\u548cPC\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8fd9\u79cd\u72ec\u5bb6\u4ea4\u6613\u88ab\u5fae\u8f6f\u81ea\u5fae\u8f6f\u81ea\u83b7\u6697\u793a\u548c\u91cd\u89c6\u8bb8\u591a\u4eba\u7684\u6697\u793a\u548c\u4e25\u91cd\u7591\u95ee\u3002Subs\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6bcd\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u544a\u4ecd\u7136\u662fPlayStation 5\u4e2a\u4e1a\u4e3b\u5e0c\u671b\u53d1\u6325\u5373\u5c06\u53d1\u6325\u7684\u60b2\u4f24\u65b0\u95fb\u7a7a\u95f4\u53f2\u8bd7\u3002 Bethesda\u8425\u9500\u548c\u901a\u4fe1Pete Hines\u9ad8\u7ea7\u526f\u603b\u88c1\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ed6\u80af\u5b9a\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3PS5\u4e1a\u4e3b\u5fc5\u987b\u611f\u53d7\u5230\u7684\u3002\u5728\u5468\u4e09\u4e0eGameSpot\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u91c7\u8bbf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ed6\u5411PS5\u4e1a\u4e3b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u540c\u60c5\u548c\u9053\u6b49\uff0c\u5bf9\u6b64\u79fb\u52a8\u611f\u5230\u4e0d\u6ee1\u3002\n \uff06\uff0334;\u6211\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u5982\u4f55\u6dd8\u6c70\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u548cPlaystation 5\u7403\u8ff7\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u8bf4i\uff06\uff0339;

And while that kind of exclusivity deal had been  hinted at and  heavily suspected by many since  Microsoft&#39;s $7.5 billion acquisition of Bethesda&#39;s parent company, the announcement still came as sad news for PlayStation 5 owners hoping to play  the upcoming space epic. Bethesda Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications Pete Hines said he can certainly understand how PS5 owners must feel. In  a video interview with GameSpot Wednesday, he offered his sympathy and an apology to PS5 owners upset about the move.\n &#34;I don&#39;t know how to allay the concerns of consumer and PlayStation 5 fans other than to say I&#39;m a PlayStation 5 player as well and I&#39;ve played games on that console and there&#39;s games I&#39;m going to continue to play on it,&#34; Hines said. &#34;But if you want to play  Starfield [it&#39;s] Xbox and PC. Sorry. All I can say is I apologize because I&#39;m certain that that&#39;s frustrating to folks, but there&#39;s not a whole lot I can do about it.&#34;\n  At the same time, Hines seemed to suggest that Xbox Cloud Gaming could provide a way for players who don&#39;t have an Xbox or a gaming PC to access  Starfield through the &#34;Xbox ecosystem.&#34; Hines mentioned that Xbox chief Phil Spencer &#34;has talked about how they&#39;re looking to expand that and... looking to bring Xbox games to folks who don&#39;t own a Series S or X or even a PC but want to play the games that we&#39;re bringing to Game Pass.&#34; That&#39;s an apparent reference to  Microsoft&#39;s recently announced plans to expand Xbox Cloud Gaming to many Smart TVs and generic web browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Edge.\n    Hines also said\u00a0 Starfield&#39;s exclusivity could help its developers focus on the gameplay experience rather than compatibility with additional platforms. &#34;I&#39;m here to tell you, and any [developer] will tell you this, [when] you go to fewer platforms, your development gets more streamlined,&#34; he said. &#34;You&#39;re not worrying about, &#39;Well, how does it work on this box versus how does it work on that box...&#39; We&#39;re not making it on that box, so it just needs to run as well as possible on this one [and] on a PC. A narrow focus always helps...&#34;\n    That statement echoes comments Bethesda producer Todd Howard  made to The Telegraph this week, when he said that &#34;by focusing on those platforms [Xbox and PC], you really get to lean in a lot on making it the best it can be for those systems.&#34;\n In that interview, Howard also said he had &#34;a little bit&#34; of reservation about not having a PS5 version of  Starfield. &#34;You don\u2019t ever want to leave people out, right?&#34; But Howard also suggested that Xbox Cloud Gaming means &#34;we see it actually opening up more and more and more so that people\u2019s ability to play our games\u2014via Game Pass and other things\u2014their ability to play our games doesn\u2019t go down. It goes up dramatically... I will just say I want everybody to have the ability to play it in some fashion.&#34;\n  Back in October, Howard  said it was &#34;hard to imagine&#34; a game like the upcoming  Elder Scrolls VI being exclusive to Microsoft&#39;s platforms. But that was before Microsoft&#39;s acquisition of Bethesda was  finalized in March, at a time when Howard admitted the two companies hadn&#39;t fully discussed the details of any multiplatform publishing agreements. &#34;We haven&#39;t gone through all of that, to be honest,&#34; he said at the time.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 00:29:59", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "vp,xbox", "title": "Bethesda vp\u4e3aStarfield\u7f3a\u5e2dPS5\u63d0\u4f9b\u9053\u6b49 ", "title_en": "Bethesda VP offers apology for Starfield\u2019s absence on PS5", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/bethesda-vp-offers-apology-for-starfields-absence-on-ps5/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["vp", "xbox"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5ac13ea09f2a094c69a891d482f9d85d.jpg", "infoid": 1066508, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u58f0\u79f0Tau\u5bb6\u65cf\u201c\u8de8\u8d8a\u201d\u73b0\u6709\u4e91VM\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u5404\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2aVM\u9ad8\u8fbe60Vcpus\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2aVCPU\u4e3a4GB\u5185\u5b58\u3002\u7f51\u7edc\u5e26\u5bbd\u9ad8\u8fbe32 Gbps\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u5404\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u8fde\u63a5\u5b58\u50a8\u5668\u8026\u5408\u3002\n \u201c\u5404\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u6b63\u5728\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u52a0\u82db\u523b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5bfb\u627e\u52a0\u901f\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6218\u7565\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u201dGoogle Cloud Ceo Thomas Kurian\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u4eec\u4e0eAMD\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6218\u7565\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4f7f\u6211\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u62d3\u5bbd\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5ba2\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f18\u60e0\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u5173\u952e\u7533\u8bf7 - \u6240\u6709\u5728\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u6700\u6e05\u6d01\u7684\u4e91\u7aef\u3002\u201d\n   \u8c37\u6b4c\u5df2\u7ecf\u7b7e\u7f72\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u9ad8\u8c03\u5ba2\u6237\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u8bd5\u7528\uff0c\u5305\u62ecTwitter\uff0cSnap\u548cDoit\u3002\n \u201c\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u70b9\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u52aa\u529b\u670d\u52a1\u5168\u7403\u516c\u5171\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8003\u8651\u56e0\u7d20\u201dTwitter Platform Lead Nick Tornow\u5728\u535a\u5ba2\u6587\u7ae0\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u4eec\u88ab\u521d\u59cb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5174\u594b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u4f4d\u6570\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u4e0eGoogle Cloud\u8fdb\u884c\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4f18\u60e0\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u7684Tau VM\u7cfb\u5217\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u201c\n  TAU VMS\u5c06\u4e8e\u4eca\u5e74\u7b2c\u56db\u5b63\u5ea6\u5230\u8fbe\u8c37\u6b4c\u4e91\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5df2\u5c06\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u653e\u5230\u5ba2\u6237\u9884\u5148\u6ce8\u518c\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u3002\u5b9a\u4ef7\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u914d\u7f6e\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c32VCPU VM Sporting 128GB RAM\u5c06\u8fbe\u5230\u6bcf\u5c0f\u65f61.35\u7f8e\u5143\u3002 ", "note_en": "Google claims the Tau family \u201cleapfrogs\u201d existing cloud VMs. The systems come in a variety of configurations, ranging up to 60vCPUs per VM, and 4GB of memory per vCPU.
