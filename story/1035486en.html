Then he should also practice with arrow(s) at the butt. First with a weak bow and then with a strong (bow) until he learns it fully well. Then go out to an open field and practice very hard shooting at a target. Shoot much until you shoot as well as you do at the butt, but be careful not to lose your (accurate) shooting. The worst thing is to try to shoot as well as your previous shot. (If you do) then you will lose (your accurate shooting). So you must not desire to shoot as well as (your) previous shot, but rather you should seek to better your shooting.</p><p>如果一个人用弱弓学会它，他也应该用一个强弓取相同的量，这样他将像另一个人一样学习它。然后，他还应该在枪托上练习箭。首先用弱弓，然后用强弓（弓），直到他完全了解为止。然后到一个空旷的地方，对目标进行非常艰苦的射击。进行很多拍摄，直到拍摄效果和对接一样，但请注意不要丢失（准确的）拍摄效果。最糟糕的事情是尝试拍摄和之前的一样。 （如果这样做），那么您将输（准确的射击）。因此，您一定不希望像以前一样拍摄好，而是应该寻求更好的拍摄。</p><p> The bow of the archer should be in accordance with his strength, so that he will be able to use his bow, and it is also necessary that his arrow(s) will be in accordance with his bow in length. The bow should also be in accordance with the arrow. The length of the arrow is from one tip of the bow to the other, with the exception of the grip. If the arrow is longer than the bow, the archer suffers and many faults become apparent. If the bow is longer than the arrow, according to the measurement that I have told you, the arrow will fall off the grip before (the bow) is fully drawn, and so (the archer) will not be able to draw it properly. His draw will look bad.</p><p>弓箭手的弓箭应与他的力量保持一致，这样他才能使用弓箭，并且还必须使他的箭头与弓箭的长度保持一致。弓也应与箭头一致。箭头的长度是从弓的一个尖端到另一个的尖端，除了手柄。如果箭头长于弓箭，弓箭手将受苦，许多错误将变得明显。如果弓长于箭头，根据我告诉您的测量，箭头会在弓（弓）完全绘制之前从手柄上掉落，因此（弓箭手）将无法正确绘制弓。他的抽签看起来不好。</p><p> Know that the length of the arrow should be as long as the arm of the archer and is as long as the length which the archer is able to draw. The bow must be as long as the arrow. One should know the length of the arrow first and then obtain a bow according to that. The grip of the bow must be eight fingers long. This grip (length) is better than all the others. The thickness of the grip should be in accordance with the grasp of its owner. If it is (too) thin, he should wrap something around it. In this subject there are many things (to be said); we have mentioned only what was necessary and have not mentioned the rest, saying that in this chapter this much is sufficient, saying let our book be not too long so that the one who reads it will not be distressed. We have abridged some of its excesses. And only God knows better.</p><p>知道箭头的长度应该与弓箭手的臂一样长，并且与弓箭手可以绘制的长度一样长。弓必须和箭头一样长。人们应该首先知道箭头的长度，然后根据该箭头获得弓形。弓的握柄必须八根手指长。这种抓地力（长度）比其他所有抓地力都好。握柄的厚度应与握持者的握柄一致。如果太薄，他应该在上面包些东西。在这个问题上，有很多事情要说。我们只提到了必要的内容，而没有提及其余的内容，说在本章中，这已经足够了，说的是让我们的书不要太长，以免使阅读本书的人感到苦恼。我们删节了它的一些过分之处。而且只有上帝知道更好。</p><p> A chapter on the quality of the bow (with which one) aims at high burcas and shoots at fortresses and at something that overlooks.</p><p>关于弓的质量的一章（其中一章）的重点是高burburs和要塞和一些忽略的东西。</p><p> This chapter relates the quality of a bow that is (used) for shooting at people in high places and fortresses.  Such a bow should have a longer upper limb and tip  than the necessary length so that, when it shoots at a high place from a lower ground, the strength of the lower limb will be more when the arrow is loosed. The bow with which you shoot down from a high place should have a shorter upper limb and tip. All the other bows should have (both limbs) equal. But the upper limbs and tips of the ordinary bows should always be longer than their lower (limbs and tips).  The arrow-pass should be at the halfway point of the bow equally. The nocking-point on the string should also be like this equally. And that is that.</p><p>本章涉及（用于）在高处和要塞人群中射击的弓的质量。这样的弓箭的上肢和指尖应该比必要的长度更长，这样，当它从较低的地面高处射击时，松开箭头时下肢的力量会更大。从高处向下射击的弓应具有较短的上肢和尖端。所有其他弓箭（两肢）应相等。但是普通弓的上肢和尖端应始终比其下肢（下肢和尖端）长。箭头通道应同样位于弓的中点。字符串上的指点也应同样如此。就是这样。</p><p>  This chapter relates the arrow. The (expert) archers have differed on the qualities of the arrow. Some of them said that “the long arrow is good,” and some have preferred the short arrow. But they all have claimed that the long arrow leaves the bow more slowly, and the short arrow leaves (the bow) more quickly.  They have claimed as such. And that is that.</p><p>本章涉及箭头。 （专家）弓箭手在箭的质量上有所不同。他们中的一些人说“长箭头是好的”，而有些人则更喜欢短箭头。但是他们都声称长箭头离开弓的速度较慢，短箭头离开弓的速度更快。他们声称是这样。就是这样。</p><p>  During a war, if you wish to shoot at (those) in a fortress while standing at the base, you should stay under your shield and then draw the bow. When you bring (the bow) to full draw, raise your hand(s) upwards, aim at your opponent and then shoot. And that is that.</p><p>在战争中，如果您想站在基地时向要塞的人射击，您应该呆在盾牌下，然后拉弓。当您将（弓）完全拉开时，向上举起手，瞄准对手，然后射击。就是这样。</p><p> A chapter on shooting in war from the top of a fortress at (the people who are) at the base of the fortress.</p><p>从堡垒顶部（在堡垒底部的人们）射击战争的一章。</p><p> If you wish to shoot from the top of a fortress at the people who are at the base of the fortress, follow your opponent closely, move the lower tip of the bow over to your right side, hold the bow across and draw it downwards. Bend your back a little, hold the arrow (that is drawn in the bow) between your two legs and shoot it. Beware not to shoot from one place in a war, but rather walk from one place to another, watch your opponent and then shoot, and that is that.</p><p>如果您想从要塞的顶部向要塞底部的人射击，请紧跟对手，将弓的下端移至右侧，将弓越过并向下拉。稍微弯曲背部，握住两条腿之间的箭头（弓上画出）。当心不要在战争中从一个地方射击，而要从一个地方走到另一个地方，看着你的对手然后射击，就是这样。</p><p>  This chapter relates how to draw the bow. The principle of drawing the bow is that you should draw it to your eyebrow and you should pass your index finger over your moustache because the master (archers) have recommended it as such. You should draw the strong bow to your moustache and hold (it on that anchor-point). When you draw, you should not raise your hand upwards. Let it also be known that the waiting time when the bow is at full-draw is to count until five. You should pause for a count of five. Some (of the expert archers) said that you should hold and (then) release (the arrow) before your face and eyes turn red. Minimum waiting time (at the full-draw position) is to count until three, but the best way is to remain silent until counting three and shoot it, and that is that.</p><p>本章涉及如何绘制弓形。画弓的原则是您应该将其画在眉毛上，并且应该将食指越过胡须，因为船长（弓箭手）就这样推荐了。您应该在胡子上画一个结实的弓并握住（在该锚点上）。绘画时，请勿向上举手。众所周知，船首完全拉开时的等待时间要数到五点。您应该暂停五秒。 （专业弓箭手中的）一些人说，应该保持住，然后放开（箭头），然后脸和眼睛变红。最少的等待时间（在完全抽签位置）是要数到三，但最好的方法是保持沉默直到数到三并射击。</p><p>  This chapter relates how to shoot (short) arrows through the hollow of a guide. This is a good skill to shoot at the people in high fortresses and the people who are far away and for many other things. Because an arrow like this travels a long distance; it travels about one thousand arshins and even more, they say. The length of an arrow (to be used with) a navak (arrow-guide) is one span, and the length of its head is four fingers. They also shoot this arrow in Khorasan, and they call it `aus in their language there. Its head is smaller than a nail. The arrow guide is also called nazil. The arrow guide is made out of many things. It is made out of a thin reed, a Persian reed or a willow tree and light and soft trees similar to these. It should be thicker than a whip. Its length should be as long as the length of the ordinary arrow (or) two fingers longer than that. Open it from its one side as much as one-third of it. Both its sides should bend inwards, so that it will not allow the arrow to go out. Then put a leather band on it and put it on your finger. Then put the arrow inside the guide and nock. Draw it as you draw an arrow in the bow. When you draw it, hold your wrist, upper arm and lower arm straight, as if all of them are one bone. When you are shooting the first arrow, pause a little (while) your hand is over your shoulder, then shoot. After that do not pause. The Muslims have invented the arrow (shot through the hollow of a) guide. It has a strange story. It has been said that a person called Tabari had related it. And that is that.</p><p>本章涉及如何通过向导的空心射击（短）箭头。这是一种向高耸的人和远方的人射击以及许多其他事情的好技能。因为这样的箭行得很远，他们说，它的行程约为一千阿什什甚至更多。箭头（与之配合使用）的长度是一个跨度，而其头部的长度是四个手指。他们还用呼罗珊语射这支箭，并在当地用“ aus”称呼它。它的头比指甲小。箭头指南也称为nazil。箭头指南由很多东西组成。它由稀薄的芦苇，波斯芦苇或柳树以及与之相似的轻软树制成。它应该比鞭子厚。它的长度应与普通箭头（或两根手指）的长度一样长。从其一侧最多打开三分之一。它的两侧都应向内弯曲，以免箭头射出。然后在上面戴上皮带，然后戴在手指上。然后将箭头放在导板内并按一下。在弓箭中绘制箭头时绘制它。绘制时，请保持手腕，上臂和下臂笔直，好像它们都是一根骨头。拍摄第一个箭头时，将手悬在肩膀上稍稍停一下，然后再拍摄。之后不要暂停。穆斯林发明了箭头（穿过a的空心）射击。它有一个奇怪的故事。据说一个叫Tabari的人与它有关。就是这样。</p><p> A chapter on shooting arrows from on top of a galloping horse. It has various graces.</p><p>一章关于从一匹疾驰的马顶上射击箭。它具有各种优点。</p><p> This chapter relates how to shoot arrows on horseback. It has many graceful things. It is necessary that you should have a proper horse. I have described before the horse that is good for shooting. When you wish to start shooting arrows on horseback (while) riding, you should take a weak bow and arrow(s) which are good for this skill. Then erect five barcas that are following each other.  The distance between each of them should be forty arshins. Then take five arrows, ride your horse fast and shoot these one after the other. When you become good at shooting at these, make the distance between them thirty arshins. Every time reduce (the distance between the barcas) like that, until the distance is seven steps. When you also become skillful at this, try to shoot fast. This (seven steps) is the limit in this practice. Then erect (them) in another way,  that is to say, three barcas on your left side and opposite to them two barcas on your right side. Then ride (your horse) fast, come and shoot first at the ones that are on your left side and then at the ones that are on your right, if you can. When you become skillful also at this, take a strong bow and shoot with it in the same way that you had done with a weak bow. Once you have perfected your accurate shooting, from then on you will shoot accurately everywhere, that is to say, in the time of war, while shooting deer and in the hippodromes. From then on you will not be afraid of shooting arrows.</p><p>本章涉及如何在马背上射箭。它有许多优美的东西。您必须有一匹合适的马。我已经描述过适合射击的那匹马。当您希望在骑马时开始射击箭时，应握住较弱的弓箭，这对这项技能很有帮助。然后架设五个彼此紧随其后的barcas。它们之间的距离应为40埃辛。然后带上五个箭头，快速骑乘马，一个接一个地射击。当您擅长于这些射击时，将它们之间的距离拉近三十埃。每次这样减少（巴卡斯之间的距离），直到距离为七步。当您也熟练掌握此功能后，请尝试快速拍摄。这（七个步骤）是这种做法的限制。然后以另一种方式竖立它们，也就是说，在您的左侧是三个barcas，在其相对的是您的右侧是两个barcas。然后快骑（马），先来射击在左侧的人，然后在右侧的（如果可以的话）射击。当您也熟练掌握此功能后，以结实的弓鞠躬并用与结弱的弓箭相同的方式射击。一旦您完成了精确的射击，从那时起，您将可以在任何地方准确地射击，也就是说，在战时，同时射击鹿和竞技场。从那时起，您将不必担心射箭。</p><p> Then erect ten barc is, five of them on your left and five of them on your right in various places. The distance between each of them should be in accordance with the limit that we had mentioned earlier. Take ten arrows that are suitable for this practice. Hold five of them together with the grip (of the bow) and insert (the other) five between the fingers of your right hand. When you finish shooting the arrows that were between your fingers, take the arrows next to the grip and insert them between your fingers, then shoot them as before. These arrows should be thin, so that they will fit between your fingers while you shoot. And only God knows better.</p><p>然后竖起十个巴克，其中五个在您的左边，五个在您的右边。它们之间的距离应符合我们前面提到的限制。取十个适合此练习的箭头。将其中五个握住（弓的握把），然后将（另一个）五个插入右手的手指之间。拍摄完手指之间的箭头后，将箭头握在握柄旁边，然后将其插入手指之间，然后像以前一样进行拍摄。这些箭头应该很细，以便在拍摄时适合您的手指。而且只有上帝知道更好。</p><p>  This text is from  Munyatu’l-ghuzat, A 14th Century Mamluk-Kiptchak Military Treatise, translated by Kurtulus Öztopçu (Sources of Oriental Languages and Literatures 13, 1989).  We thank the  Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations of Harvard University for their permission to republish this section.</p><p>本书摘自Munyatu’l-ghuzat，《十四世纪马穆鲁克-基普查克军事论文集》，由KurtulusÖztopçu翻译（东方语言和文学资料，1989年13月）。我们感谢哈佛大学近东方语言与文明系允许重新发布本节。</p><p> This entry was posted in  Primary Sources and tagged  14C,  Islamic,  Mamluk.
