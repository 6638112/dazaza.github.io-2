The numbers are reported to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, but companies have dedicated more and more resources to publicly displaying their commitments to diversity. The displays are impressive. The results are not.</p><p>在过去七年的每一年中，主要科技公司都发布了多样性报告，绘制了他们所采用的妇女人数和颜色的人数。这些数字向平等就业机会委员会报告，但公司致力于越来越多的资源，公开展示其对多样性的承诺。展示令人印象深刻。结果不是。</p><p> These companies spend millions on targeted outreach and strategic partnerships, but the results change little from year to year. Between 2014 and 2020, for example,  the share of Black and Latinx tech workers at Facebook each increased by less than 2 percentage points.</p><p> 这些公司在有针对性的外展和战略伙伴关系上花费了数百万美元，但结果从一年到一年变化少。例如，在2014年和2020年之间，Facebook的黑人和拉丁科技工人的份额均增加了不到2个百分点。</p><p>   The nationwide reckoning on race and racism last year exposed what many tasked with diversity work have privately discussed for years: that Silicon Valley’s own diversity and recruitment structures can hinder the work of opening doors to new people from different backgrounds with new ideas.</p><p>   去年全国范围内遭到竞赛和种族主义，暴露了多年来有多个经济作品的任务：硅谷自己的多样性和招聘结构可以阻碍与新想法不同背景开启门的工作。</p><p> Call it “diversity theater”: the many PR rituals and bureaucracies obscuring the line between the value of diversity and how companies actually treat their marginalized employees trying to make a change.</p><p> 称之为“多样性剧院”：许多PR仪式和官僚机构掩盖了多样性价值与公司实际上如何对待他们的边缘化员工试图改变。</p><p>  Consider the annual ritual of the diversity reports themselves. When companies issue statements after missing diversity goals, the apology usually comes from a chief diversity officer—often one of the few nonwhite executives at the company in the first place.</p><p>  考虑多样性的年度仪式报告自己。当公司在缺少多样性目标后发出声明时，道歉通常来自首席分流官员 - 往往是本公司少数非凡的高管之一。</p><p> “We aren’t where we’d like to be,” Facebook’s chief diversity officer, Maxine Williams,  wrote in 2017. “We continue to have challenges,” she wrote  the next year. In 2018, she was one of only nine Black females among Facebook’s top 1,053 executives. “We must continue our work,”  wrote Melonie Parker, Google’s head of diversity, in 2019. Google listed only five Black females among its top 357 officers in 2018, the most recent numbers available.</p><p> “我们不是我们想成为的地方，”Facebook的首席分流官Maxine Williams，于2017年写道。“我们继续挑战，”她在明年写道。 2018年，她是Facebook的1,053名高管中九个黑色女性之一。 “我们必须继续我们的工作，”2019年谷歌的多样性负责人梅隆帕克写了Melonie Parker。谷歌仅在2018年的357名军官中列出了五名黑人女性，最近的数字是可用的最新数字。</p><p>  Current and former tech workers, all people of color, tell WIRED how diversity theater provides cover for actions by superiors that they consider hypocritical. They argue for new means for measuring progress and outline steps for longer lasting, structural change.</p><p>  当前和前技术人员，所有颜色的人，告诉有线多样性剧院如何为上级的行动提供他们认为虚伪的。他们争论用于测量进度和概述步骤的新手段，以便更持久，结构变化。 </p><p> Last summer, tech companies including  Amazon,  Google, and  Pinterest joined a corporate chorus of support for Black Lives Matter in the aftermath of George Floyd’s killing. As companies set  new diversity goals and  pledged millions in  support for nonprofits, two Black women came forward with their own experiences in tech. Aerica Shimizu Banks and Ifeoma Ozoma  tweeted that they were underpaid, threatened, and harassed by colleagues at Pinterest, even as the company  tweeted support for Black Lives Matter.</p><p>去年夏天，科技公司包括亚马逊，谷歌和Pinterest在乔治·弗洛伊德杀害的后果中加入了一家支持黑人生活的支持。由于公司设定了新的多样性目标并承诺数百万支持非营利组织，两名黑人妇女在科技的经验中出现了。 Aerica Shimizu Banks和Ifeoma ozoma推文，他们被Pinterest的同事受到了威胁，威胁，骚扰，甚至公司推断对黑人生活的支持。</p><p>  Banks worked on the public policy team for about a year, beginning in 2019. At first, she says, her manager lauded her for her policy and equity work. Things shifted in December 2019, she says, when she questioned how Pinterest treated contract catering and janitorial workers. She spoke out  against a company decision not to provide boosted holiday pay for contractors.</p><p>  从2019年开始，银行在公共政策团队上工作了大约一年。首先，她说，她的经理为她的政策和股权工作而赞扬了她。她在2019年12月转移的事情，她说，当她质疑Pinterest对待合同的合同餐饮和janitorial工人。她讨论了公司决定不提供承包商的提升假期支付。</p><p> In prior years, Pinterest had given these contractors the week between Christmas and New Year’s Day off and paid them for the entire week. In December 2019, the company announced a change: Contractors would still have the week off, but would be paid only for the two holidays. In emails reviewed by WIRED, one Pinterest manager said the company would be “offering shifts for deep cleaning for those who do not have enough vacation to cover rent/needs.”</p><p> 在之前的几年里，Pinterest在圣诞节和新年的一天休息一周赋予了这些承包商，并为整个星期支付了他们。 2019年12月，该公司宣布改变：承包商仍将休息一周，但只需为两个假期支付。在通过有线审核的电子邮件中，一位Pinterest经理表示，该公司将“为那些没有足够的假期覆盖租金/需求的人提供深度清洁的转变。”</p><p> “Way before I spoke out publicly I was speaking up internally, and I was punished for it.”</p><p> “在我公开发言之前，我在内部发表讲话，我受到了惩罚。”</p><p> Once news of the contract decision broke, Banks flagged it to managers, writing in emails that the decision seemed “not aligned with a company [focused on] social impact.”</p><p> 一旦合同决定破产，银行将它标记为管理人员，在电子邮件中写作，决定似乎“没有与公司进行社会影响的公司”未对准。</p><p> Executives eventually reversed the decision not to pay contractors, but Banks said her manager criticized her advocacy in her performance review, taking issue with Banks’ tone, and the company’s general counsel specified that the change had nothing to do with her. In the evaluation, reviewed by WIRED, the manager said Banks should improve how “she assesses and presents issues internally,” saying that during the contractor pay dispute she “framed the issue in a way that suggested there was only one reasonable option.”</p><p> 高管最终扭转了不支付承包商的决定，但银行表示，她的经理在她的绩效审查中批评了她的宣传，并与银行的语气发出问题，并将该公司的一般律师指出，这一变革与她无关。经理审查的评估，经理表示，银行应该改进“她在内部评估和提出问题”的方式，这意见这是在承包商支付争端时，她“以某种方式构成了这个问题，建议只有一个合理的选择。”</p><p>  Banks says she felt blindsided. Her job was to advocate for equity and make recommendations around fairness. Shouldn’t that apply to the low-wage workers serving lunch and cleaning the offices at the company as well?</p><p>  银行说她感到盲目。她的工作是倡导公平，并根据公平提出建议。不应该适用于供应午餐和清理公司的办事处的低工资工作者？ </p><p>  “Oh, here&#39;s our diversity champion,” she says, describing how she felt tokenized by the company. “Here&#39;s our expert in this area. Here&#39;s our figurehead. But we don&#39;t actually want her to do the work we&#39;ve hired her to do.”</p><p>“哦，在这里＆＃39;我们的多样性冠军，”她说，描述了她如何被公司象征化。 “在这里我们的专家。在这里＆＃39;我们的傀儡。但我们实际上希望她能做我们的工作＆＃39;雇用她的工作。“</p><p> The other Black woman on the three-member policy team tells WIRED she faced similar treatment. Ifeoma Ozoma says that even as Pinterest made a show of spotlighting Black creators on the platform, it marginalized her and Banks. She described the company’s Black Lives Matter statement as “a moment of violent hypocrisy.”</p><p> 三会员政策团队的另一个黑人女子告诉有线她面临着类似的治疗。 ifeoma ozoma说，即使是Pinterest在平台上发现了黑色创造者的表现，它也会被边缘化了她和银行。她将该公司的黑人生活陈述称为“一刻暴力虚伪”。</p><p> In December 2019, Pinterest announced  it would no longer promote weddings or other events held at plantations. Former slave plantations in the American south are popular wedding venues, but many people find the sites offensive. When the civil rights group Color of Change petitioned Pinterest to reconsider promoting the content, Ozoma worked with organizers at the group to persuade the company to stop accepting ads from these venues. Users searching terms like “plantation wedding” would receive a message noting the content violates Pinterest’s terms of service.</p><p> 2019年12月，Pinterest宣布将不再推广在种植园举行的婚礼或其他活动。美国南方的前奴隶种植园是受欢迎的婚礼场所，但很多人都发现景点令人反感。当民权集团的变革中的颜色请愿Pinterest重新考虑促进内容，ozoma与集团的组织者合作，说服公司停止接受这些场地的广告。用户搜索术语，如“种植园婚礼”将收到一条消息，注明内容违反Pinterest的服务条款。</p><p> The press coverage surrounding the change was resoundingly positive. Soon, other platforms followed suit. Ozoma expected leadership would laud her for leading the change. But her manager took issue with her handling of the incident, writing in her performance review that Ozoma should have provided more context to the other policy managers, including the “pros/cons” of the decision. As a consequence, the review reads, Ozoma’s team lacked “all the information they might need to make an informed choice.”</p><p> 围绕变化的新闻覆盖率响亮了。很快，其他平台跟着套装。臭氧预计领导将赞美她引领改变。但她的经理在她处理事件的情况下发出问题，在她的绩效审查中写作ozoma应该向其他政策管理人员提供更多背景，包括决定的“利弊”。因此，审查所阅读，ozoma的团队缺乏“他们可能需要做出明智的选择的所有信息”。</p><p> Speaking to WIRED, Ozoma says she found it absurd to have to list the “pros” of plantation events. She says the incident highlighted a disconnect between how companies publicly and privately address calls for equity and fairness.</p><p> ozoma表示，奥兹马说，她发现它荒谬必须列出种植纲事件的“优点”。她说，该事件强调了如何在公开和私人地址呼吁股权和公平的呼吁之间断开连接。</p><p> “Way before I spoke out publicly I was speaking up internally, and I was punished for it,” she says.</p><p> “在我公开发表讲话之前，我在内部发表讲话，我被惩罚了，”她说。</p><p> Both women filed complaints with California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing. They later settled with Pinterest for a confidential amount. In December, a group of shareholders  filed suit against Pinterest, saying its mistreatment of Banks and Ozoma damaged the company’s public image.</p><p> 两名妇女都向加州公平就业和住房部提出了投诉。他们后来与Pinterest进行保密金额。 12月，一群股东提出了诉讼，反对Pinterest，称其对银行和奥泽马的虐待损失了该公司的公共形象。 </p><p> A Pinterest spokesperson didn’t respond to the specifics of Ozoma’s and Banks’ accounts, but said in a statement to WIRED, “Pinterest is fully committed to advancing our culture and creating an environment that’s diverse, equitable, and inclusive for everyone. From revamping our unconscious bias training, working to improve representation in our workforce, and continuing to ensure the content on Pinterest is inclusive and representative, culture is a top priority.”</p><p>一个Pinterest发言人没有回应Ozoma和银行的账目的细节，但在一份发表的情况下说，“Pinterest完全致力于推进我们的文化，创造一个多样化，公平，包容的环境。从改造我们无意识的偏见培训，致力于改善员工队伍中的代表，并继续确保Pinterest的内容是包容性和代表性的，文化是一个首要任务。“</p><p>  Tech workers and recruiters WIRED contacted spoke of a type of double-consciousness: As part of their jobs they work to identify and ameliorate racial trauma (for example, through recruiting more people of color or changing company culture through unconscious bias training), all while being  subjected to racial trauma. This was further heightened last summer, as protest footage and Floyd’s last moments looped endlessly on social media and the evening news.</p><p>  技术工人和招聘人员有线联系了一种双重意识的谈话：作为他们工作的一部分，他们努力识别和改善种族创伤（例如，通过招募更多的颜色或通过无意识的偏见训练培训的人或不断变化的公司文化）受到种族创伤。去年夏天，这进一步增长，因为抗议镜头和弗洛伊德的最后时刻环绕在社交媒体和晚间新闻。</p><p>  “It’s an issue of unpaid labor,” says Rhonda Allen, CEO of /dev/color, a nonprofit that offers development and networking opportunities for Black software engineers. “The additional processing of individual and collective trauma in order to help our companies do better and better, we have to recognize that as the work that it is,” she says.</p><p>  “这是一个未付劳动的问题，”/ dev / color的首席执行官Rhonda allen说，一个非营利组织，为黑色软件工程师提供开发和网络机会。 “额外处理个人和集体创伤，以帮助我们的公司更好，我们必须认识到这是它的工作，”她说。</p><p> To foster diversity and support for workers, tech companies formed employee resource groups. These are company-sponsored semiformal groups of employees. Companies have ERGs for women, people of color, parents, and so on. But, Ozoma notes, these ERGs can provide cover for hypocritical behavior. Two of the managers who she says mistreated her at Pinterest sponsored ERGs for minority employees.</p><p> 为促进对工人的多样性和支持，科技公司已形成员工资源组。这些是公司赞助的半正面员工群体。公司拥有妇女的Ergs，颜色，父母等人。但是，Ozoma注意，这些ERG可以为虚伪行为提供掩护。她说的两位经理人在Pinterest赞助Ergs为少数民族员工虐待她。</p><p>  “At the same time as they&#39;re harming folks in marginalized communities, they&#39;re whitewashing their reputations within the same companies,” Ozoma said.</p><p>  “与他们在同一时间和＃39;重新伤害边缘化社区中的人，他们＆＃39;在同一公司中仔细抨击他们的声誉，”奥泽姆说。</p><p> Surviving in this kind of environment is difficult, explains Oscar Veneszee Jr., a Navy veteran and recruiter for Facebook. He says that, in his experience, people of color at tech companies feel pressured to inure themselves to their own mistreatment in service to the company.</p><p> 在这种环境中幸存是困难的，奥斯卡·威斯坦Jr.，海军老将和Facebook招聘人员解释。他说，在他的经验中，科技公司的颜色人们感到压力，以造成自己的虐待，为公司提供虐待。</p><p> “When you talk about imposter syndrome, well yeah. I am an imposter,” he says. Because I show up every day [as] someone else. And the better I can become at being someone else, the better I&#39;ll thrive at this company.”</p><p> “当你谈论冒名抑菌综合征，呀呀时候。我是一个冒名者，“他说。因为我每天都会出现[作为]别人。我能成为别人的更好，我又茁壮成长，更好。“ </p><p> Last June, Veneszee and two other Black employees filed a complaint with the EEOC alleging the social network doesn’t give Black workers equal opportunity to advance. He says he routinely won praise from managers but was never formally rated better than “meets expectations” and was never promoted.</p><p>去年6月，威尼斯和另外两名黑人员工向呼吁社会网络申请申诉申请，不会让黑人工人平等晋级机会。他说，他经常赢得了经理的赞美，但从未正式评价比“符合预期”，从未晋升过。</p><p>  “There may be Black Lives Matter posters on Facebook’s walls, but Black workers don’t see that phrase reflecting how they are treated in Facebook’s own workplace,” their complaint reads. The case is pending.</p><p>  “在Facebook的墙上可能有黑色的生活邮件，但黑人工人没有看到这句话反映了他们在Facebook自己的工作场所的治疗方式，”他们的投诉读。案件待定。</p><p> “We&#39;re focused on creating a more diverse and inclusive workplace, advancing racial justice, and holding ourselves accountable,” a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. Since last summer, the company has added diversity and inclusion goals to senior leaders&#39; performance reviews and changed how employees report discrimination, microaggressions and policy violations, among other changes.</p><p> “我们＆＃39;重点是创造一个更多样化和包容性的工作场所，推进种族正义，并持有自己的责任，”在一份声明中表示。自去年夏天以来，该公司增加了多样性和包括高级领导人的目标和纳入目标;绩效评估和改变员工如何报告歧视，微不足道和政策违规以及其他变化。</p><p>  “I think corporate America is scared,” said Peter Romer-Friedman, Veneszee’s attorney. “We&#39;re really seeing Black professionals who have done everything right to advance themselves in their careers and their education, but they see they’re up against a cinder block ceiling.”</p><p>  “我认为美国美国人害怕，”普瑞斯·弗里德曼·弗里德曼（Peter Romer-Friedman）说。 “我们真的看到了黑人专业人士，他们已经做出了正确的一切力量，以便在他们的职业生涯和教育中提升自己，但他们看到他们反对煤渣阻挡天花板。”</p><p> Romer-Friedman said he’s seeing more Black workers, including professionals in tech, taking legal action to challenge discrimination. “They&#39;re tired of being second-class citizens in the workplace,” he says.</p><p> Romer-Friedman表示，他看到更多的黑人工人，包括技术专业人士，采取法律行动来挑战歧视。 “他们厌倦了在工作场所成为二等公民，”他说。</p><p> The dynamic recurred in December, when Timnit Gebru, a well-known artificial intelligence researcher, left Google; she says  she was fired. Gebru studied the ethical consequences of AI and also contributed to diversity efforts at Google. Shortly before leaving the company, she wrote an open letter to an internal listserv for women on Google’s AI team, voicing her frustrations and echoing the concerns of Banks, Ozoma, and Veneszee.</p><p> 12月份的动态重复，当时是一位知名人工智能研究员，留下了谷歌的Timnit Gebru;她说她被解雇了。 Gebru研究了AI的道德后果，也有助于谷歌的多样性努力。在离开公司之前不久，她在谷歌的AI团队中向一个内部Listserv撰写了一个公开信，向谷歌的AI团队，宣传她的挫败感并回应银行，ozoma和veneszee的担忧。</p><p> “Your life gets worse when you advocate for underrepresented people,” the letter read.</p><p> “当你倡导不足的人时，你的生活会变得更糟，”这封信读了。 </p><p>  Diversity theater creates a sense of dissonance: Workers have to represent the company publicly while feeling victimized by it privately; they must identify shortcomings but are punished for acting on them. Gebru’s letter aired a number of privately held criticisms. Since her departure, calls at Google have grown for structural changes and a push for a new approach to diversity and inclusion that is worker-led and longer lasting.</p><p>多样性剧院创造了一个不和谐的感觉：工人必须公开代表公司，同时私下感受它受害;他们必须识别缺点，但受到行动的惩罚。 Gebru的信播出了一些私人批评。自从她离开以来，谷歌的呼叫已经成长为结构性变化，并推动了一种新的多样性和包容性的方法，即工人领导和更长的持久性。</p><p> Raksha Muthukumar has worked at Google as a software engineer for two years. She quickly joined the queer pride ERG and mentored high school students on the Google campus. But she says the experience left her “feeling a bit empty.”</p><p> Raksha Muthukumar在Google曾作为软件工程师工作了两年。她迅速加入了谷歌校园的奇怪骄傲的ERG和媒体高中生。但她说经验留下了她的“感觉有点空”。</p><p> Many people of color in tech want to do progressive work around marginalized groups. But the companies decide what are the acceptable and unacceptable ways to do it. For Muthukumar, Gebru’s letter mirrored her own frustration of “trying to do good but being trapped by the confines of the corporation.”</p><p> 技术中的许多颜色想要在边缘化群体中进行进步的工作。但这些公司决定了哪些可接受和不可接受的方法。对于Muthukumar来说，Gebru的信让自己沮丧的“尝试做好事，而是被公司的范围困住。”</p><p> In the aftermath of the Floyd protests, Muthukumar says, Google leadership encouraged workers to share their experiences and resources on ways to help. But when Muthukumar circulated GoFundMe links, she was reprimanded by HR. One of the GoFundMe links included derogatory messages about police, and a coworker complained. The incident confused her: How can anyone engage with the realities of racism and the Floyd murder but ignore the social frustration toward law enforcement?</p><p> 在弗洛伊德抗议活动的后果中，Muthukumar称，谷歌领导力鼓励工人在帮助方面分享他们的经验和资源。但是，当Muthukumar循环Gofundme链接时，她被人力资源部受到谴责。其中一个Gofundme链接包括关于警察的贬义信息，以及一位同事抱怨。这一事件困惑了她：谁能如何与种族主义的现实和弗洛伊德谋杀谋杀，但忽略了对执法的社会挫折？</p><p>  Muthukumar says it felt like there was some invisible line between acceptable and unacceptable ways to pair her job with activist endeavors, and the company decided when it’d been crossed. She later joined hundreds of other Googlers to create the Alphabet Workers Union.</p><p>  Muthukumar说，它觉得在接受和不可接受的方式之间有一些隐形的界限，可以与活动家努力配对她的工作，而公司在交叉时决定。她后来加入了数百名其他歌谣，以创建字母工人联盟。</p><p>  “It&#39;s part of the tactics to scare people,” says Charles Shaw, a Google engineer and vice chair of the Alphabet Workers Union. “If you don&#39;t know when you&#39;ve crossed the line, you&#39;re afraid to ever get anywhere near that line, and you&#39;re afraid to speak out at all.”</p><p>  “恐吓人民的策略的一部分，”谷歌工程师和字母工人联盟的副主​​席和副主席表示，＆＃39; “如果你不知道你何时何时交叉，你越过了那条线，你甚至害怕留在那条线附近的任何地方，你甚至害怕说出来。”</p><p> These incidents have Muthukumar wondering about the value of encouraging other people of color to come to Google. “If Google is doing a bunch of bad work, is it really better if I get a whole bunch of more queer women of color working here with me?” she asks.</p><p> 这些事件有Muthukumar想知道鼓励其他颜色的人们来谷歌的价值。 “如果谷歌正在做一堆坏的工作，那么如果我得到一大堆更多的糖果的颜色和我在这里工作？”她问。 </p><p> “If you don&#39;t know when you&#39;ve crossed the line, you&#39;re afraid to ever get anywhere near that line, and you&#39;re afraid to speak out at all.”</p><p>“如果你不知道你何时何时交叉，你越过了那条线，你甚至害怕留在那条线附近的任何地方，你甚至害怕说出来。”</p><p> Google has said Gebru resigned. In response to the formation of AWU, Google sent a statement from Kara Silverstein, its director of people operations. “We&#39;ve always worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding workplace for our workforce. Of course our employees have protected labor rights that we support. But as we’ve always done, we’ll continue engaging directly with all our employees.”</p><p> 谷歌表示，Gebru辞职。为了响应AWU的形成，谷歌向其人工业务总监Kara Silverstein发了陈述。 “我们常常努力为我们的劳动力创造一个支持性和有益的工作场所。当然，我们的员工有保护我们支持的劳工权利。但正如我们一直在完成的那样，我们将继续与我们所有的员工直接参与。“</p><p> AWU is pushing for changes beyond diversity, including a more transparent ethical review for product launches, more support for ERGs, and a ban on police and military contracts. This more expansive set of goals is in line with new approaches to equity and fairness in Silicon Valley.</p><p> AWU正在推动超越多样性的变化，包括对产品发布的更加透明的道德审查，更多的支持ERG，以及禁止警察和军事合同。这种更广泛的目标符合硅谷公平和公平的新方法。</p><p> “Let&#39;s make this a 10- to 20- to 30-year commitment versus a flash-in-the-pan reactionary kind of thing,” says Sherrell Dorsey, founder and CEO of The Plug, a subscription-based news platform. Last year, Dorsey compiled a list of the financial promises that companies made in the aftermath of the Floyd murder.</p><p> “让＆＃39;这使得这是一个10到20到30年的承诺与闪存的反动性的东西，”插头的创始人兼首席执行官Sherrell Dorsey说，这是一个基于订阅的新闻平台。去年，DORSEY编制了公司在弗洛伊德谋杀案之后所作的财务承诺。</p><p> Rather than one-time payments, she urges companies to rethink equity in terms of structural investments: support for fair housing, raising the minimum wage, and equal access to education. This, in turn, should lead to a shift in how advocates measure progress.</p><p> 她敦促公司在结构投资方面敦促公司重新考虑公平：对公平住房的支持，提高最低工资，以及平等的教育机会。反过来，这应该导致倡导如何衡量进展的转变。</p><p> In Gebru’s letter, she suggested forgoing the traditional diversity, equity, and inclusion structure entirely and instead petitioning outside organizations, like the Congressional Black Caucus, for change. Banks, the former Pinterest worker, agrees that the time has come to look beyond tech when companies fail to keep their promises.</p><p> 在Gebru的信中，她建议完全讨论传统的多样性，公平和包容结构，而是在外面的组织中请求，如国会黑核心核糖，改变。前北极星工人银行同意，当公司未能保持承诺时，时间就会超越技术。</p><p>  “Where is the accountability when it&#39;s voluntary?” Banks asks. She says shareholders could play an important role in holding companies to their commitments. In December, for example, New York State’s comptroller, who helps manage the state’s pension funds,  called for Amazon shareholders to vote on commissioning an independent audit of the company’s civil rights practices.</p><p>  “＆＃39;自愿的问责制在哪里？”银行问道。她说，股东可以在将公司举行承诺方面发挥重要作用。例如，12月，纽约州的议会，他帮助管理州的养老基金，呼吁亚马逊股东投票投票调试该公司的民权行为独立审计。 </p><p> “That&#39;s where regulation comes in. That&#39;s where the lawsuits come in. That&#39;s where the public criticism comes in, because we need to hold these folks accountable,” she says.</p><p>“那个法规进来的地方。该诉讼进来的地方。公众批评进来的地方，因为我们需要抓住这些人负责，”她说。</p><p> Workers also need the ability to speak freely about their experience. Ozoma and Banks, formerly at Pinterest, are now fighting for California’s Senate Bill 331, which  would strengthen limitations on nondisclosure agreements. They hope the bill will stop Silicon Valley’s ability to say one thing and do another.</p><p> 工人还需要能够自由地对自己的经历进行讲话。 ozoma和银行以前在Pinterest，现在正在为加州的参议院比尔331而战，这将加强对非专题协定的局限性。他们希望该法案将阻止硅谷的能力说一件事并做另一件事。</p><p> “The same companies putting out Black Lives Matter statements [are] forcing people to sign NDAs where they can&#39;t talk about the discrimination and harassment that they receive from those same people who are putting out the statements,” Ozoma says.</p><p> “这同样的公司推出了黑人生活陈述[是]强迫人们在他们可以签署的人签署纳米队，谈论他们从正在进行陈述的同样人民那里收到的歧视和骚扰，”奥泽姆说。</p><p> An earlier state law, passed at the height of the #MeToo era, protected workers who spoke out against sexual harassment, even if they signed NDA’s. But the law does not cover race-based harassment, meaning, as Black women Ozoma and Banks could discuss gender-based discrimination but not racism.</p><p> 较早的国家法律，通过了#METOO时代的高度，保护的工人谈到了性骚扰，即使他们签署了NDA。但法律并未涵盖基于比赛的骚扰，意思，因为黑人女性卵瘤和银行可以讨论基于性别的歧视但不是种族主义。</p><p> “Any accountability we want we have to demand,” Ozoma says. “If anything comes from 2020, I hope it&#39;s radicalizing people such that they do everything they can to see the kind of change that they know would improve their workplace for the folks they care about.”</p><p> “我们想要的任何问责制要求，”Ozoma说。 “如果有的话来自2020年，我希望它＆＃39;自然化人们这样做，这样他们就可以看到他们所知道的改变的一切，以便为他们关心的人们改善他们的工作场所。”</p><p>   📱 Torn between the latest phones?
