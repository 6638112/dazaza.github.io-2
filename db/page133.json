Now there are walkways allowing visitors to explore the tunnels and chambers.\n Alfonsina Russo, the director of the Colosseum, said the hypogeum, which was originally excavated in the 19th century, was the true \u201cbackstage\u201d of the amphitheatre.\n \u201cToday we are returning to the public a monument within a monument,\u201d Russo said. \u201cWhat emerged [from the project] is that the hypogeum had a 400-year-long history, from when the amphitheatre opened in AD80 to the final show in 523.\u201d\n She said the 15 restored corridors recounted \u201ctraces [of history] left over time\u201d.\n More than 80 archaeologists, architects and engineers were involved in the two-year project to \u201cbring back to the centre of attention a monument that the whole world loves\u201d, said Diego Della Valle, the chairman of Tod\u2019s.\n There was much criticism when Italy\u2019s culture minister, Dario Franceschini, announced several public-private partnerships for the renovation of Rome\u2019s monuments. The restoration of the hypogeum is the second part of a three-phase project on the Colosseum that began eight years ago and for which Tod\u2019s has paid a total of \u20ac25m (\u00a321m).\n The first phase focused on a clean-up of the Colosseum\u2019s facade, and the final part, expected to be completed in 2024, will involve restoring the galleries and lighting system as well as adding a new visitor centre.\n \u201cIt\u2019s right to have full public-private collaboration,\u201d Franceschini said. \u201cThe project is really important and demonstrates how an Italian company, which exports all over the world, then invests back in its country to protect its artistic and cultural heritage.\u201d\n Other Italian brands that have paid for the renovations of key monuments include Fendi, which restored the Trevi Fountain, and Bulgari, which restored the Spanish Steps.\n Meanwhile, a project to restore the  floor of the Colosseum to its former glory is expected to be completed in 2023. The new, hi-tech stage, which could host cultural events, will be able to quickly cover or uncover the underground networks, allowing them to be protected from the rain or to be aired out.\n In Roman times, crowds would fill the Colosseum to watch gladiators defeat animals including bears, tigers, elephants and rhinoceroses.", "posttime": "2021-06-26 13:01:32", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7f57\u9a6c,tunnels,\u6062\u590d", "title": "\u7f57\u9a6c\u7684\u5730\u4e0b\u96a7\u9053\u5b8c\u5168\u5411\u516c\u4f17\u5f00\u653e ", "title_en": "Underground tunnels of Rome\u2019s Colosseum fully opened to public", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/25/underground-tunnels-of-romes-colosseum-fully-opened-to-public", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f57\u9a6c", "tunnels", "\u6062\u590d"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "51779d757729477ea50d56d7efeecdb7.jpeg", "infoid": 1068383, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u6700\u8fd1\u5728\u6211\u7684\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u79ef\u538b\u677f\u4e0a\u6253\u5f00\u4e86\u4e00\u5f20\u673a\u7968\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u7ed5\u8fc7API\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u524d\u7aef\u56e2\u961f\u4f7f\u7528\u6211\u7684\u56e2\u961f\u7684API\u5bf9Elasticsearch\u7684\u76f8\u5f53\u6c89\u91cd\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684API\u7f51\u5173\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u529f\u80fd\u662f\u7f13\u5b58\u91cd\u578b\u805a\u5408\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u301c30\u79d2\u3002\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u5076\u5c14\u4ed6\u4eec\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u5728\u301c30\u79d2\u7f13\u5b58\u7a97\u53e3\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u4e24\u4e2a\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5e76\u5e0c\u671b\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u96c6\u3002\n \u6253\u5f00\u7684\u8bf7\u6c42\u8bfb\u53d6\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u201cAPI\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u7981\u7528\u67d0\u4e9b\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u201d\u3002\u5728REST-ISH-FUL API\u5de5\u4f5c\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u5927\u7ea6\u6570\u5b66\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e9b\u7acb\u5373\u60f3\u5230\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u662f\uff1a\n  \u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b58\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u7f13\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\u8bf7\u6c42\u6307\u4ee4\u3002\n  \u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u6807\u9898\u7f13\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\uff1a\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5c11\u7684API\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u786e\u4fdd\u6211\u7684API\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e38\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u6765\u66f4\u8f7b\u677e\u5730\u4f7f\u6211\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u3002\n \u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u8981\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ea\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u4f60\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u5f53\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0d\u610f\u5473\u7740\u60a8\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5c06\u671f\u671b\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u5b83\u8fd8\u5e76\u4e0d\u610f\u5473\u7740\u60a8\u7684\u7528\u6237\u77e5\u9053\u60a8\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002\n  \u65e0\u8bba\u60a8\u8ba4\u4e3a\u60a8\u7684API\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u5426\u662f\u201c\u6807\u51c6\u201d\u6216\u201c\u9884\u671f\u201d\uff0c\u5c31\u4f1a\u5411\u60a8\u7684\u6587\u6863\u6dfb\u52a0\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5bf9\u6211\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684Readme.md\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4ee3\u7801\u6bb5\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u6240\u9700\u8981\u7684\u3002\n ##\u7f13\u5b58Businingif\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u4e0d\u5e0c\u671b\u60a8\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u8bf7\u4f7f\u7528\u7f13\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\u6807\u9898\u3002\u7f13\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\uff1a\u65e0\u5546\u5e97 \n\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u7591\u95ee\u6216\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u8bf7\u6309\u7167Twitter @Q_Vault\u6253\u51fb\u6211\u3002 \u5982\u679c\u6211\u5728\u6587\u7ae0\u4e2d\u72af\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u8bf7\u52a1\u5fc5\u8ba9\u6211\u77e5\u9053\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230\u7ea0\u6b63\uff01 ", "note_en": "I recently had a ticket opened on my team\u2019s backlog board requesting the ability to bypass our API\u2019s caching system. For context, our front-end team uses my team\u2019s API to make fairly heavy requests to ElasticSearch, and one of the features of our API gateway is to cache the results of heavy aggregations for ~30 seconds. It turns out, every once in a while they need to run two of the same query within the ~30-second caching window and want an updated result set.\n The request that was opened read something like, \u201cthe API needs a parameter to disable caching for certain queries\u201d. When working in a REST-ish-ful API there are approximately  math.MaxInt ways to accomplish that, and some of the first ones that immediately came to mind were:\n  As it turns out, there\u2019s already a standard for this sort of thing, the   Cache-Control request directives.\n  Using the standard header  Cache-Control: no-store not only makes my job easier by requiring fewer API design decisions but also ensures that my API\u2019s clients aren\u2019t surprised by a new way to accomplish a common task.\n I do want to point out, however, that just because you\u2019ve decided to use a fairly well-supported standard, doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t other standards your users will expect. It also doesn\u2019t mean that your users are aware of the existence of the standard you\u2019ve chosen.\n  Regardless of whether or not you think your API\u2019s behavior is \u201cstandard\u201d or \u201cto be expected\u201d, just add the behavior to your docs anyway. For me, the following snippet in our  Readme.md was all we needed.\n ## Cache bustingIf you don&#39;t want your query cached, use the Cache-Control header.  Cache-Control: no-store\n Follow and hit me up on Twitter  @q_vault if you have any questions or comments.

WDC-21008  Product Line:\u00a0WD My Book Live and WD My Book Live Duo  Published:\u00a0June 24, 2021\n  Western Digital has determined that some My Book Live and My Book Live Duo devices are being compromised through exploitation of a remote command execution vulnerability. In some cases, the attackers have triggered a factory reset that appears to erase all data on the device.\n We are reviewing log files which we have received from affected customers to further characterize the attack and the mechanism of access. The log files we have reviewed show that the attackers directly connected to the affected My Book Live devices from a variety of IP addresses in different countries. This indicates that the affected devices were directly accessible from the Internet, either through direct connection or through port forwarding that was enabled either manually or automatically via UPnP.\n Additionally, the log files show that on some devices, the attackers installed a trojan with a file named \u201c.nttpd,1-ppc-be-t1-z\u201d, which is a Linux ELF binary compiled for the PowerPC architecture used by the My Book Live and Live Duo. A sample of this trojan has been captured for further analysis and it has been   uploaded to VirusTotal.\n Our investigation of this incident has not uncovered any evidence that Western Digital cloud services, firmware update servers, or customer credentials were compromised. As the My Book Live devices can be directly exposed to the internet through port forwarding, the attackers may be able to discover vulnerable devices through port scanning.\n We understand that our customers\u2019 data is very important. We do not yet understand why the attacker triggered the factory reset; however, we have obtained a sample of an affected device and are investigating further. Additionally, some customers have reported that data recovery tools may be able to recover data from affected devices, and we are currently investigating the effectiveness of these tools.\n The My Book Live series was introduced to the market in 2010 and these devices received their final firmware update in 2015.\n  At this time, we recommend you disconnect your My Book Live and My Book Live Duo from the Internet to protect your data on the device.\n We have heard customer concerns that the current My Cloud OS 5 and My Cloud Home series of devices may be affected. These devices use a newer security architecture and are not affected by the vulnerabilities used in this attack. We recommend that eligible My Cloud OS 3 users   upgrade to OS 5 to continue to receive security updates for your device.", "posttime": "2021-06-26 12:19:38", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4e66\u7c4d,wd,\u8bbe\u5907", "title": "WD\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u63aa\u65bd\u4e3aWD\u6211\u7684\u4e66\u7c4d\u76f4\u64ad\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u4e66\u5b9e\u51b5\u4e8c\u4eba ", "title_en": "WD Recommended Security Measures for WD My Book Live and WD My Book Live Duo", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.westerndigital.com/support/productsecurity/wdc-21008-recommended-security-measures-wd-mybooklive-wd-mybookliveduo", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4e66\u7c4d", "wd", "\u8bbe\u5907"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d1615bb7dc31e3f074082558ea885b96.jpg", "infoid": 1068381, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters", "note_en": "Among certain philosophers it is a commonplace that dreams are radically private, that no one can follow you into them. A fragment from Heraclitus distills the problem: \u201cThe universe for those who are awake is single and common, while in sleep each person turns aside into a private universe.\u201d Hegel, commenting on this same fragment, says that \u201cthe dream is a knowledge of something of which I alone know.\u201d [1] Consider how you might teach a child to understand the meaning of the word \u201cdream.\u201d You cannot point anywhere and say, \u201cThat\u2019s a dream.\u201d Nor can you say at any moment to the child, \u201cLook, I\u2019m dreaming,\u201d and be doing it.\n The science of dreams\u2014first psychoanalysis, and then neuroscience\u2014has inherited this frame of reference. In 1900, Freud writes that dreams are \u201ccompletely asocial.\u201d A hundred years later, Yuval Nir and Giulio Tononi, two leaders in contemporary brain research, write that \u201cdreams \u2026 show that the human brain, disconnected from the environment, can generate an entire world of conscious experiences by itself.\u201d [2] Here, dreams are, by definition, that whole nocturnal life you cannot share, that  second life as Nerval wrote, with its unexpected villains and lovers, its indescribable moonscapes, its fantastical concatenations of memory, its unfathomable vehicles and dungeons, its transports of flight, and its corporeal crises when the limbs turn stiff and the monster is upon you. Dreams mean disconnection and disengagement from the framework of this our shared world, and immersion in them is so strange, so sorrowful, so disorienting, sometimes so very shameful, that we can barely coax them into the light even should we want to.\n And yet, despite this vision of dreams as paradigmatically distant, many of the world\u2019s cultures\u2014especially outside of the modern West\u2014have developed elaborate protocols by which dreams can be shared. The complexity of these protocols is confirmation, in one sense, of the claim that dreams are especially private, even more so than other forms of thinking. A society must work very hard indeed to make them sharable; they must be wrestled into this life from that nighttime one. But these protocols are also somehow a rebuke to the philosophers\u2019 skepticism: people build their own universes in dreams, except, as we\u2019ll see, they then go to great lengths to reconstruct and combine them into a shared one while awake. This seems to raise at least two questions. Why go to such great lengths to share dreams? And what happens to a culture, like our own, that doesn\u2019t practice dream sharing, that (a few isolated realms aside, perhaps the most important being psychoanalysis) has largely given up on it?\n The task of this essay is to consider what dream sharing looks like across the globe, particularly in certain small-scale societies where it has been elevated to the level of an art form (or, perhaps, beyond it). In dream sharing, something from the depths of sleep is harnessed for use in the public world, in the community of the awoken. For many cultures, as we\u2019ll see, dream sharing is a protocol for regular renegotiation of what might be termed the  social contract of sensuous imagining, the set of images and emotions and unseen realities that govern, even more than abstract ideas, \u2028an individual\u2019s relationship to society and to \u2028the cosmos.\n In the most familiar cases, dream-sharing protocols involve recounting the dream, and then asking someone to interpret it.  I dreamt of gathering wheat under a full moon. Interpretation: you will be married within the year. It\u2019s a process that people in our own culture still practice, both on the analyst\u2019s couch and at the kitchen table\u2014though in the wrong company telling a dream might get you dismissed as boring, and interpreting one might get you mocked for being superstitious.\n Historically, traditions of great intellectual subtlety have developed to interpret dreams, and to consider what interpreting a dream actually means. In the Palestinian Talmud, for instance, it\u2019s made quite clear that when it comes to prophetic dreams, what causes the fulfillment of a prophecy is not the dream itself (or its originator, God), but rather the  interpretation of the dream. If a rabbi interprets a dream as foretelling the death of the dreamer and then the dreamer dies, then it\u2019s the  rabbi\u2019s fault that he\u2019s died. [3] Similarly, Cicero writes that the dream-obsessed people of Telmessos blamed the interpreters, and not the dreamer, if a dream prediction turned out to be false; it wasn\u2019t the dream itself that was wrong\u2014such a phrase would have made no sense to the dreamers of Telmessos\u2014it was the interpretation that had failed. [4] Already in these instances some unexpected epistemological principles are being entertained. A dream and its interpretation do not follow one another directly in the way of a question and its answer. Each has its own life, its own path of causation, its own relationship to the truth. These overlap in places, and separate decisively in others. In some cases, the interpretation even overwhelms and redirects the dream.\n But this is only the beginning, for there are many cultures where recounting and interpreting is not the paradigm for dream sharing at all. Instead, dreams are understood to be sites of action; not texts but places, not a coded language but a part of reality. Often they connect individuals to cosmologies that bend space and time in ways closer to Einstein than Newton. The experienced reality of the dream\u2014not its purported meaning, but its spaces, timescales, transformations, felt experience\u2014is what\u2019s evoked, what\u2019s brought into the public realm of waking life, and what\u2019s made use of. It may be that a key task\u2014hunting, for example\u2014is accomplished in dreams before it can be accomplished in waking life. Or it may be, as among the Wayuu of Colombia and Venezuela, that the trajectory of a dream is altered by being retold in waking life, with the expectation that the next night, the dream itself will change, and, as a result, the person\u2019s waking life will too. [5] (A similar technique has been pioneered by the therapist Barry Krakow to work with trauma victims: by writing down in a journal happier endings to their recurrent nightmares, the patients could tame them \u2028in sleep.) [6]\n Among many Aboriginal peoples of Australia, dreams are understood to be important conduits into a metaphysical system often called in English the Dreamtime (though it is important to note that despite this nomenclature, the concept\u2019s exact relation to sleep dreams varies considerably among different Aboriginal traditions, and is a matter of some scholarly debate). [7] The Dreamtime, or Dreaming, is the heroic myth-world, and also the realm of laws, traditions, ideals. Aboriginal philosophy is subtle and sophisticated, in all likelihood ungraspable to the uninitiated; furthermore, the generalizations of anthropologists inevitably fail to capture the reality of a community in which myths and songs and ideas are created, negotiated, and modified by individuals, each with a distinctive cast of mind, some of them especially prodigious and brilliant dreamers. But we can trace some lineaments of this intellectual world, keeping in mind that they (and other traditions described in this essay) relate to individual practice the way a broad history of the novel might relate to the specific complexity of Proust or Dickens.\n   The Dreaming is both the primal world, the Creation, and also a world that continues to exist all around us, its separateness from everyday life a matter of temporary perspective rather than intractable fact. In many Australian cultures, dreams provide an essential point of connection. Conception occurs when a soul crosses over from one realm to the other in dreams; death doesn\u2019t truly occur until a person is sighted one last time in a dream; dreams produce insights about where to hunt, or they answer a question about lineage; sometimes they give birth to new songs and new rituals; they often provide a stage on which dreamers can glimpse the eternal and world-creating movements of their individual ancestors, whose inner essence their own bodies contain. The anthropologist Sylvie Poirier reports that among the Pintupi of the Western Desert, the dream-world and the waking world have to be regularly realigned with one another. She writes that once she was riding with a family in a car that broke down in the desert. The car got fixed, but for it to  really be fixed, it needed to be working again in the dream-world as well as the waking one. \u201cAs the engine started running again,\u201d Poirier recalls, \u201ca young woman pointed at her toddler and said, \u2018Might be that boy had a dream about that car and saw it working properly.\u2019\u201d [8]\n It would be a discredit to the Pintupi to say that for them, dreams are  merely prophetic. For the thing the dream predicts has already happened. Rather, the events of dreams and the events of waking life are required to be somehow in accord. And, what\u2019s more, if the boy did actually dream of the car working, then when it starts working, his family members have accomplished the very thing that Heraclitus and Hegel cannot accept: they\u2019ve  seen his dream, they can say \u201che is dreaming of a car working\u201d and also see a car working, and can understand these two phenomena as one and the same.\n In this society, where a boy must dream of a car working for the car to work, there is little that resembles what we might call dream interpretation. Sylvie Poirier, again: \u201cWhat possibly might be seen, at first, as a lack of interest in dream interpretation reveals, on closer examination, another local reality\u2014the paramount role of the action of dreaming itself in one\u2019s life itinerary and in the unfolding of reality.\u201d [9] Dream life and waking life do not exist in a hermeneutic relation to one another\u2014instead, they are interpenetrable and complementary planes of existence. Acting in one has an effect in the other\u2014which in turn has an effect again in the first, and on and on in a continuous cycle.\n Robin Ridington has shown, in a series of magnificent books and essays, how a Den\u00e9 people of the Canadian interior, the Dane-zaa (or Dunne-za), use dreaming to give shape to the substance and structure of their lives. Building on years of work with Dane-zaa Dreamer Charlie Yahey and other tradition-bearers, Ridington writes, \u201cCamps among the Dunne-za were always set up so that there was bush unbroken by human trails in the direction of the rising sun. People slept with their heads in this direction and received images in their dreams. These dream images were believed to have come down to them along the path of the sun. In order to cross trails with an animal in the bush, the hunter had first to make contact with the sun\u2019s path across the sky.\u201d [10] Animals had to be taken (or give themselves up) in dreams before they could be killed in waking life; indeed, the real hunt took place in dreams, and the waking hunt was only its fulfillment or realization. The details constituting this system of dream-knowing were in every instance intimately tied to the practical skills required to survive on the ecological knife-edge that is the boreal forest. (\u201cThat\u2019s hungry country up there,\u201d an ethnobotanist once told me, \u201cless food than the Kalahari.\u201d) For example, just as hunters had to receive dreams along the path of the sun, so in waking life they relied on the sun for orientation amid the vast expanses of taiga. To improve his status, a hunter not only needed to give gifts and perform feats; he needed to defeat his rivals in dream battles. [11]\n   For the Dane-zaa, as for many such dream-sharing cultures, the mixing of dreams and waking life occurred already at the very headwaters of history. In the mythtime, a boy is abandoned by his father on an island, and survives because he makes contact with his medicine animals in dreams. They teach him how to hunt in the remote place where he\u2019s been left to die. He then defeats his father and returns from the island to subdue the giant animals who once roamed the earth eating humans. He acquires the name Ts\u00e1\u00e1yaa and becomes a culture hero, sending the animals underground so that their subterranean bodies become the breathing, slumbering contours of the landscape. The remaining animals are smaller, and humans can hunt them, inaugurating a new era. In this new time, Ts\u00e1\u00e1yaa\u2019s actions have made it possible for humans to become the hunters rather than the hunted. In fact, his dreams become the template for making contact through visions with the sleeping animal giants, and enlisting their aid in the hunt of their smaller kin.\n A nomadic culture cannot afford to express itself in huge numbers of material artifacts. But a system of dreams and visions, a network of images, a world-picture mapping and ordering the perceivable world, imparted through language, retained in the imagination\u2014this can be carried easily, with no added burden to the back (though presumably the weight on mind and memory is prodigious and requires great training to bear). For a nomadic community, a cosmology and its dream manifestations are as a portable Chartres, a weightless Louvre, a repository of knowledge, history, and advice, of injunctions to change your life or keep it as it is, all expressed in sensuous, globalizing form. This vast place is entered every night and taken along every morning in the mind, and it is both an image of possibility and a theater of action. To dream of giant animals who help you hunt their shrunken descendants changes, profoundly, your relationship to the animals you see in waking life. So, too, failure to capture an animal might force a transformation in your relationship\u2014your allegiances, your supplications\u2014to the giant animals of your dreams. \u201cThe true art of these people,\u201d Ridington writes, \u201cwas their relationship to the world itself\u201d\u2014though perhaps  art is a pale analogy for a still more consequential form of representation, one that is simultaneously a world-picture and a decisive and causative component within the world itself. [12]\n And here we are ushered into the central mystery of dream sharing, the key to its being at once an avenue into the numinous and a mechanism of the law: the world-picture that is also the world. We have been habituated to a tradition that considers dreams to be essentially texts awaiting decipherment. [13] But in the examples above, on the contrary, dreams are treated as fully four-dimensional, as complete sensual realities in which the dreamer lives just as she lives in a four-dimensional, sensual reality while awake. In this lived reality of dreams, however, two paradoxical qualities are foregrounded in a way that they are not in waking existence. On the one hand, dreams appear extraordinarily pliable when seen from the outside, as for example what is described in the Upanishads: \u201cThis is how he dreams. He takes materials from the entire world, and taking them apart on his own and then on his own putting them back together, he dreams with his own radiance, his own light.\u201d On the other, seen from the inside, once the dreamer is in the dream, there is almost no escape, no agency, as in this description given by Isaac Tens, a Tsimshian shaman, who faints in the woods after seeing a giant owl fly down and grab hold of him: \u201cI dreamed that I was now flying way up into the Sky, and here I saw a great many strange things. And I knew that it was the owl which was flying me up by grasping my head. Then I suddenly awoke \u2026 When I returned to the house of my father, I told him what had happened to me. So he said to me, \u2018The reason this has happened to you, is that you will be a great Shaman Halait.\u2019\u201d [14]\n These qualities seem to hold true across all human dreaming, though it is in the thinking of dream-sharing societies that they tend to achieve their fullest description. What is the purpose of such precise reflection on the nature and content of dreaming? To talk about dreams in waking life is to talk about the state of mind in which the world-picture we have internalized (and even in some sense authored) has absolute power over us. Make no mistake: such a state of mind is not limited to dreams. How often in our waking lives does our capacity for distanced reflection disappear, our self-consciousness vanish in the face of fear, reflex, desire, engrossment? But immersion in the world-picture is elusive in waking life, pitching in and out, furtive precisely because we cannot achieve any distance from it when we experience it. Dreams, on the other hand, are a discrete manifestation of the world the imagination generates, sealed off by the envelope of sleep, and (at least sometimes) available to the memory afterward. (And let it be clear that  imagination is not meant here as a denigrating word, equivalent to  fiction or  superstition, but rather to describe those sensual forms\u2014images, sounds, feelings\u2014not perceived by the bodily senses). Dreams are instances where the imagination unfurls its full power over us, its capacity to situate us within an entire cosmos. Dreams show how the imagination mediates between perception and action, how it takes our experience of reality and directly transmutes it into a set of possible feelings, desires, and behaviors. And dreams are instances in which these powers of the imagination can be later contemplated, while waking, at a distance. To discuss dreams, tweak them, act them out, try to alter them and manipulate them in waking life\u2014this is an attempt to achieve distance from the imagination\u2019s world-picture so as to study and refine it.\n What is essential to understand is that this is not merely a question of ideology. The culture of modern universities, in which I was trained, has many extremely sophisticated vocabularies for discussing abstractions and their relationship to experience. But we are, in contrast, poor in any praxis that might help negotiate the relationship between the patterns of sensual cognition (images, figures, sounds, memories) and the perceptual, material world in which, while awake, we all act. For these sensuous forms of thought often feed directly into action or reaction, affect and emotion, bypassing entirely the abstract vocabulary by which we might describe their substructures. (Someone can have written a dissertation on structural racism and still find himself afraid of a Black man walking behind him on the street.) Dreams have historically been one place where such praxes have been developed, where the world-picture can be contemplated discretely, and modified when needed.\n One of the most explicit\u2014and most beautiful\u2014examples that I know by which dreams are socialized into waking life belonged until recently to the Ongees of the Andaman Islands. Vishvajit Pandya worked in the 1980s among these members of one of the last hunter-gatherer cultures in the Bay of Bengal. [15] Pandya explains that before going to bed, the Ongees narrated to one another their dreams from the night before, and their experiences of the day that had just ended, especially their time spent in the forest hunting and gathering food. But in doing so, they would  negotiate the content of their dreams, modifying it so that everyone\u2019s dream accounts might be gradually aligned with one another. One person might report having dreamt of fishing on the south beach of the island, another picking nuts on the west beach, then the first might suggest a compromise:  We both went fishing in our dreams, but on the west beach.\n The indigenous explanation for this extraordinary process, Pandya reports, is as follows. During dreaming, the inner self leaves the outer self (the body) and travels the island in order to recuperate the bits of being that a person has lost during the day. These bits of being are most commonly manifest as stray smells, marooned on bushes and trees by the body during its daytime passage around the island. As the inner self collects these smells in the d\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-26 11:37:50", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

", "note_en": "Investing in cryptocurrency means taking on risks, but getting scammed shouldn\u2019t be one of them. Reports to the FTC\u2019s Consumer Sentinel  1 suggest scammers are cashing in on the buzz around cryptocurrency and luring people into bogus investment opportunities in record numbers. Since October 2020, reports have skyrocketed, with nearly 7,000 people reporting losses of more than $80 million on these scams.  2 Their reported median loss? $1,900. Compared to the same period a year earlier, that\u2019s about twelve times the number of reports and nearly 1,000% more in reported losses.  3\n Some say there\u2019s a Wild West vibe to the crypto culture, and an element of mystery too. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts congregate online to chat about their shared passion. And with bitcoin\u2019s value soaring in recent months, new investors may be eager  to get in on the action. All of this plays right into the hands of scammers. They blend into the scene with claims that can seem plausible because cryptocurrency is unknown territory for many people. Online, people may appear to be friendly and willing to share their \u201ctips.\u201d But that can also be part of the ruse to get people to invest in their scheme. In fact, some of these schemes are based on referral chains, and work by bringing in people who then recruit new \u201cinvestors.\u201d\n Many people have reported being lured to websites that look like opportunities for investing in or mining cryptocurrencies, but are bogus. They often offer several investment tiers \u2013 the more you put in, the bigger the supposed return. Sites use fake testimonials and cryptocurrency jargon to appear credible, but promises of enormous, guaranteed returns are simply lies. These websites may even make it look like your investment is growing. But people report that, when they try to withdraw supposed profits, they are told to send even more crypto \u2013 and end up getting nothing back.\n Then, there are \u201cgiveaway scams,\u201d supposedly sponsored by celebrities or other known figures in the cryptocurrency space, that promise to immediately multiply the cryptocurrency you send. But, people report that they discovered later that they\u2019d simply sent their crypto directly to a scammer\u2019s wallet. For example, people have reported sending more than $2 million in cryptocurrency to Elon Musk impersonators over just the past six months.\n Scammers even use online dating to draw people into cryptocurrency investment scams. Many people have reported believing they were in a long-distance relationship when their new love started chatting about a hot cryptocurrency opportunity, which they then acted on. About 20% of the money people reported losing through romance scams since October 2020 was sent in cryptocurrency, and many of these reports were from people who said they thought they were investing.  4\n Since October 2020, people ages 20 to 49 were over five times more likely to report losing money on cryptocurrency investment scams than older age groups.  5 The numbers are especially striking for people in their 20s and 30s: this group reported losing far more money on investment scams than on any other type of fraud,  6 and more than half of their reported investment scam losses were in cryptocurrency.  7 In contrast, people 50 and older were far less likely to report losing money on cryptocurrency investment scams. But when this group did lose money on these scams, their reported individual losses were higher, with a median reported loss of $3,250.\n To be clear, while investment scams top the list as the most lucrative way to obtain cryptocurrency, scammers will use whatever story works to get people to send crypto. That often involves impersonating a government authority or a well-known business. For example, many people have told the FTC they loaded cash into Bitcoin ATM machines to pay imposters claiming to be from the Social Security Administration. Others reported losing money to scammers posing as Coinbase, a well-known cryptocurrency exchange. In fact, 14% of reported losses to imposters of all types are now in cryptocurrency.  8\n Here are some things to know to play it safe(er) when it comes to cryptocurrency:\n Promises of guaranteed huge returns or claims that your cryptocurrency will be multiplied are always scams.\n  The cryptocurrency itself  is the investment. You make money if you\u2019re lucky enough to sell it for more than you paid. Period. Don\u2019t trust people who say they know a better way.\n  If a caller, love interest, organization, or anyone else insists on cryptocurrency, you can bet it\u2019s a scam.\n To learn more about cryptocurrency scams, visit  ftc.gov/cryptocurrency.
