At one point, she had only three surgical masks left and worried that she could no longer safely treat patients.</p><p>麦格雷戈里博士说，“作为一家独立的诊所，与大型医疗系统没有真正的联系，这太糟糕了。”她一度只剩下三个医用口罩，担心自己再也不能安全地治疗病人了。</p><p> Families were also staying away, concerned about catching the virus. “I did some telemedicine, but it wasn’t enough volume to really replace what I was doing in the clinic,” she said.</p><p>家庭也在远离，担心感染病毒。她说：“我做了一些远程医疗，但数量不足以取代我在诊所里做的事情。”</p><p> After her husband found a new job in a different state, Dr. McGregory, 49, made the difficult decision to close her practice in August. “It was devastating,” she said. “That was my baby.”</p><p>在丈夫在另一个州找到一份新工作后，49岁的麦格雷戈里博士做出了一个艰难的决定，在8月份关闭了她的诊所。“这是毁灭性的，”她说。“那是我的孩子。”</p><p> Many other doctors are also calling it quits. Thousands of medical practices have closed during the pandemic, according to  a July survey of 3,500 doctors by the Physicians Foundation, a nonprofit group. About 8 percent of the doctors reported closing their offices in recent months, which the foundation estimated could equal some 16,000 practices. Another 4 percent said they planned to shutter within the next year.</p><p>许多其他医生也在叫停。非营利组织医师基金会7月份对3500名医生进行的一项调查显示，在流感大流行期间，已有数千家医疗机构关闭。约8%的医生报告称，近几个月来关闭了他们的诊所，该基金会估计，这可能相当于约1.6万家诊所。另有4%的人表示，他们计划在明年内关闭。</p><p> Other doctors and nurses are retiring early or leaving their jobs. Some worry about their own health because of age or a medical condition that puts them at high risk. Others stopped practicing during the worst of the outbreaks and don’t have the energy to start again. Some simply need a break from the toll that the pandemic has taken among their ranks and their patients.</p><p>其他医生和护士正在提前退休或离职。一些人担心自己的健康，因为年龄或健康状况使他们处于高危状态。其他人在疫情最严重的时候停止练习，没有精力重新开始。一些人只是需要从大流行给他们的队伍和患者带来的损失中休息一下。</p><p> Another analysis, from the Larry A. Green Center with the Primary Care Collaborative, a nonprofit group, found similar patterns. Nearly a fifth of primary care clinicians  surveyed in September say someone in their practice plans to retire early or has already retired because of Covid-19, and 15 percent say someone has left or plans to leave the practice.</p><p>拉里·A·格林中心(Larry A.Green Center)与非营利组织初级保健合作组织(Primary Care Collaborative)的另一项分析发现了类似的模式。在9月份接受调查的初级保健临床医生中，近五分之一的人表示，他们的执业医生中有人因为新冠肺炎的原因计划提前退休或已经退休，15%的人表示有人已经或计划离开诊所。</p><p> The clinicians also painted a grim picture of their lives, as the pandemic enters a newly robust phase with record case counts in the United States. About half already said their mental exhaustion was at an all-time high. Many worried about keeping their doors open: about 7 percent said they were not sure they could remain open past December without financial help.</p><p>临床医生也为他们的生活描绘了一幅严峻的图景，因为大流行进入了一个新的强健阶段，美国的病例数量创下了纪录。大约一半的人已经表示，他们的精神疲惫程度达到了历史最高水平。许多人担心继续敞开大门：约7%的人表示，他们不确定在没有财政援助的情况下，他们能否在12月之后继续敞开大门。</p><p> “Honestly, if it hadn’t been for the pandemic, I would have still been working because it was not my plan to retire at that point,” said Dr. Joan Benca, 65, who worked as an anesthesiologist in Madison, Wis.</p><p>65岁的琼·本卡(Joan Benca)博士在威斯康星州麦迪逊担任麻醉师，她说，“老实说，如果不是大流行，我还会继续工作，因为那时退休不是我的计划。”</p><p> But her daughter and son-in-law hold administrative positions in a hospital intensive care unit, treating the sickest Covid patients, and they have two small children. When cases climbed in the spring, their day care center closed, and Dr. Benca’s daughter desperately needed someone she trusted to look after the children.</p><p>但她的女儿和女婿在一家医院的重症监护病房担任行政职务，治疗病情最严重的Covid患者，他们有两个年幼的孩子。当病例在春季攀升时，他们的日托中心关闭了，本卡医生的女儿迫切需要一个她信任的人来照顾孩子。</p><p> “It wasn’t the way I wanted to end my career,” Dr. Benca said. “I think for most of us, we would say, you would fall on your sword for your family but not for your job,” she said, adding that she knows other female colleagues who have stayed home to care for children or older relatives.</p><p>“这不是我想以这种方式结束我的职业生涯，”本卡博士说。“我认为，对我们大多数人来说，我们会说，你会为家庭而死，但不会为工作而死，”她说。她还说，她认识其他留在家里照顾孩子或年长亲戚的女同事。</p><p>  Dr. Michael Peck, 66, an anesthesiologist in Rockville, Md., decided to leave after working in April in the hospital’s intensive care unit, intubating critically ill patients, and worrying about his own health. “When the day was over, I just said, ‘I think I’m done’ — I want to live my life, and I don’t want to get ill,” said Dr. Peck, who had already been cutting back his hours.</p><p>66岁的迈克尔·佩克(Michael Peck)医生是马里兰州罗克维尔的一名麻醉师。今年4月，他在医院的重症监护室工作，为危重病人插管，担心自己的健康，因此决定离职。“一天结束后，我只是说，‘我想我完了’--我想过我的生活，我不想生病，”佩克博士说，他已经在减少工作时间了。</p><p> He is now spending a few hours a day as the chief medical officer for a start-up.</p><p>他现在每天花几个小时担任一家初创企业的首席医疗官。</p><p> Still, most practices have proved resilient. The Paycheck Protection Program — authorized by Congress to help businesses, including medical practices, with the economic fallout of the pandemic — helped many doctors remain afloat. That money “kind of made me solid,” said Dr. Ripley Hollister, a family physician in Colorado Springs who serves as chairman of the research committee for the Physicians Foundation. The volume now “is really coming back,” he said.</p><p>尽管如此，事实证明，大多数做法都是有弹性的。由国会授权的Paycheck Protection Program帮助包括医疗机构在内的企业应对疫情的经济影响，帮助许多医生维持生计。科罗拉多州斯普林斯的家庭医生、内科基金会研究委员会主席里普利·霍利斯特(Ripley Hollister)博士说，这笔钱“在某种程度上让我变得稳固”。他说，现在的销量“真的在回升”。</p><p> But, depending on the future course of the pandemic, Dr. Lisa Bielamowicz, a co-founder of Gist Healthcare, a consulting firm, predicts “another wave of financial stress hitting practices.” Many doctors’ groups will seek a buyer, whether a hospital, an insurance company or a private equity firm that plans to roll up practices into a larger business.</p><p>但是，咨询公司Gist Healthcare的联合创始人丽莎·比拉莫维奇(Lisa Bielamowicz)博士预测，根据疫情的未来进程，“将会出现另一波财务压力冲击实践。”许多医生团体将寻找买家，无论是医院、保险公司还是计划将诊所整合为更大业务的私募股权公司。</p><p> One doctor, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are confidential, said she and her partner had already been talking with the nearby hospital nearby about buying their pediatric practice before the pandemic arrived in the United States.</p><p>一名医生说，在疫情到达美国之前，她和她的伴侣已经在与附近的医院讨论购买儿科诊所的事宜。由于讨论是保密的，这名医生要求不具名。</p><p> Although federal aid has helped, patient visits are still 15 percent below normal, she said, and they are continually worried about making payroll and having enough doctors and staff to see patients. As the number of virus cases balloons in the Midwest, her employees must deal with increasingly agitated parents.</p><p>她说，尽管联邦援助有所帮助，但就诊人数仍比正常水平低15%，他们继续担心发工资和有足够的医生和工作人员看病。随着中西部地区病毒病例数量的激增，她的员工必须与越来越焦躁的父母打交道。</p><p> “They’re yelling and cussing at my staff,” she said. Working for a telemedicine firm might be an alternative, she added. “It’s a hard job to begin with, to own your own business,” she said.</p><p>“他们对我的员工大喊大叫，骂我，”她说。她补充说，为远程医疗公司工作可能是另一种选择。她说：“要想拥有自己的企业，从一开始就是一项艰难的工作。”</p><p> The coronavirus crisis has amplified problems that doctors were already facing, whether they own their practice or are employed. “A lot of physicians were hanging on by a thread from burnout before the pandemic even started,” said Dr. Susan R. Bailey, the president of the American Medical Association.</p><p>冠状病毒危机放大了医生已经面临的问题，无论他们是拥有自己的诊所还是受雇。美国医学会(American Medical Association)主席苏珊·R·贝利(Susan R.Bailey)博士说，“甚至在疫情爆发之前，许多医生就已因职业倦怠而命悬一线。”</p><p> In particular, smaller practices continue to have difficulty finding sufficient personal protective equipment, like gloves and masks. “The big hospitals and health care systems have pretty well-established systems of P.P.E.,” she said, but smaller outfits might not have a reliable source. “I was literally on eBay looking for masks,” she said. The cost of these supplies has also become a significant financial issue for some practices.</p><p>特别是，规模较小的诊所仍然很难找到足够的个人防护装备，如手套和口罩。她说，“大医院和医疗保健系统都有相当完善的体育教育系统，”但规模较小的机构可能没有可靠的来源。她说：“我真的是在eBay上寻找口罩。”对于一些做法来说，这些用品的成本也已经成为一个重大的财务问题。</p><p> Doctors are also stressed by the never-ending need to keep safe. “There is a hunker-down mentality now,” Dr. Bailey said. She is concerned that some doctors will develop PTSD from the chronic stress of caring for patients during the pandemic.</p><p>医生们也因为永无止境的安全需要而感到压力。贝利博士说，“现在有一种低调的心态。”她担心，一些医生会因为在疫情期间照顾病人的长期压力而患上创伤后应激障碍(PTSD)。</p><p> Even those who are not responsible for running their own practices are leaving. Courtney Barry, 40, a family nurse practitioner at a rural health clinic in Soledad, Calif., watched the cases of coronavirus finally ebb in her area, only to see wildfires break out. Many of her patients are farmworkers and work outside, and they became ill from the smoke.</p><p>即使是那些不负责管理自己的诊所的人也在离开。40岁的考特尼·巴里(Courtney Barry)是加利福尼亚州索莱达市一家乡村诊所的家庭护士，她眼睁睁地看着她所在地区的冠状病毒病例最终消退，却眼睁睁地看着野火爆发。她的许多病人都是农场工人，在外面工作，他们因为吸烟而生病。</p><p> In 14 years as a nurse, Ms. Barry has never experienced anything “like this that is just such a high level of stress and just keeps going,” she said, adding, “The other hard part is there’s no end in sight.”</p><p>在14年的护士生涯中，巴里从未经历过这样的事情，“压力如此之大，而且还在继续，”她说，并补充说，“另一个艰难的部分是看不到尽头。”</p><p> She tried working fewer days but decided eventually that she would stop altogether for several months beginning in early December. Ms. Barry hasn’t figured out what’s next for her.</p><p>她试图减少工作天数，但最终决定从12月初开始完全停止工作几个月。巴里还没有想好她的下一步是什么。</p><p> “My intention is to stay in medicine, although I would not be totally opposed to doing something in a totally different area, which is something that I would not have said in the past,” she said.</p><p>她说：“我的目的是留在医学界，尽管我不会完全反对在一个完全不同的领域做一些事情，这是我过去不会说的。”</p><p> And patients have indeed felt the effects. The pandemic has developed into “a really huge disruption,” said Dr. Hollister, the family physician, who thinks closed practices are likely to result in “a significant impairment to patients’ access to medical care.” In his community, where both specialists and primary care doctors are leaving, he is tending to more patients who no longer have a doctor.</p><p>患者确实感受到了影响。霍利斯特博士是一名家庭医生，他认为封闭的诊所很可能会导致“患者获得医疗服务的机会受到严重损害”。霍利斯特博士说，疫情已经发展成了“一场真正的巨大破坏”。在他所在的社区，专科医生和初级保健医生都在离开，他正在照顾更多不再有医生的病人。</p><p> It is an issue that Dr. McGregory, who took a job at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison, worries about. There were some families in her practice whom she could not convince to find another pediatrician immediately. She said they “are waiting, which I discouraged, because I think every child should have a medical home.”</p><p>麦格雷戈里博士曾在麦迪逊的威斯康星大学医学院和公共卫生学院工作，他担心这个问题。在她的诊所里，有一些家庭她无法说服他们立即寻找另一位儿科医生。她说，他们“正在等待，这是我不鼓励的，因为我认为每个孩子都应该有一个医疗院。”</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/15/health/Covid-doctors-nurses-quitting.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/15/health/Covid-doctors-nurses-quitting.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/流行/">#流行</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/calling/">#calling</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/医生/">#医生</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
