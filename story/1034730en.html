He got up late and often stayed in bed until the afternoon. He never held down a real job. He thought the two best pleasures were &#39;fucking and drinking&#39;, which left him confused as to why more people weren’t drunk more often because they certainly weren&#39;t fucking enough. He had a terrible caffeine addiction and often drank tea late into the night, getting through pints of it every day.</p><p>与许多白手起家的人不同，塞缪尔·约翰逊很懒。他起得很晚，经常在床上躺到下午。他从未保住过一份真正的工作。他认为最好的两种乐趣是做爱和喝酒，这让他很困惑，为什么更多的人没有更频繁地喝醉，因为他们肯定不够做爱。他有严重的咖啡因瘾，经常喝茶喝到深夜，每天喝掉一品脱咖啡因。</p><p> And yet, he was prodigious. As well as the famous dictionary he wrote poetry, biography, innumerable essays and reviews, a philosophical novella, a travel book, he edited Shakespeare, and produced the monumental  Lives of the Poets. He was no slouch when it came to research. He once told George III that in order to write one book you &#39;have to turn over half a library.&#39;</p><p>然而，他是个了不起的人。除了著名的词典，他还写了诗歌、传记、无数的散文和评论、一部哲学中篇小说、一本游记，他还编辑了莎士比亚，并出版了不朽的《诗人的一生》。谈到研究，他可不是无精打采的人。他曾告诉乔治三世，为了写一本书，你必须交出半个图书馆。</p><p> This dual personality is a mark of his depression. Burton&#39;s  Anatomy of Melancholy was his favourite book, the only one that got him out of bed earlier than he wanted to get up. He loved his wife but suffered from sexual loneliness and dissatisfaction. He was a widower for a long time and was often moody, prejudiced, argumentative, and solitary.</p><p>这种双重人格是他抑郁的标志。伯顿的“忧郁解剖”是他最喜欢的书，也是唯一一本让他早早起床的书。他爱他的妻子，但饱受性孤独和不满之苦。他做了很长一段时间的鳏夫，经常喜怒无常、有偏见、好争辩和孤独。</p><p> But he was also warm hearted and generous. He found Oliver Goldsmith on the verge of being homeless and used his critical influence to sell  The Vicar of Wakefield that afternoon to save Goldsmith from penury. He left money to his servant, Francis Barber, a freed slave whom he treated as an equal and wrote encouraging letters to help his education, telling him ‘you can never be wise unless you learn to love reading.’ He maintained a circle of close, committed friends.</p><p>但他也很热心，慷慨大方。他发现奥利弗·戈德史密斯(Oliver Goldsmith)处于无家可归的边缘，并利用他的关键影响力在当天下午卖掉了韦克菲尔德的牧师，将戈德史密斯从穷困中解救出来。他把钱留给了他的仆人弗朗西斯·巴伯(Francis Barber)，巴伯是一名获得自由的奴隶，他平等地对待他，并写了鼓励信来帮助他接受教育，告诉他，除非你学会热爱阅读，否则你永远不会变得聪明。他保持着一个亲密、忠诚的朋友圈。</p><p>  He was deeply religious. He found spiritual things moving and important from a young age. The ghost in Hamlet scared him so much as a ten year old that he didn&#39;t read the play again for years and years. He was a stubborn High Church Tory in the age of Whiggery. He was also a borderline Jacobite.</p><p>他虔诚地信仰宗教。他从小就发现灵性的东西既动人又重要。《哈姆雷特》中的鬼魂把他吓得像个十岁的孩子，以至于他很多年都没有再读过这部剧。在威格里时代，他是一个顽固的高级教会保守党人。他也是一个边缘雅各布派。</p><p> Before he was famous, he was a failure. For his whole life, he resented the poverty he had lived in when he was young in London. He’d had to save his one clean shirt for the day in the week when he made house visits. He left Oxford because he couldn’t afford the fees. He founded and ran a failed school, losing most of his wife&#39;s money in the process. After that his play  Irene, written to be the great tragedy of the age, was a flop. Aged 30, he wasn’t shaping up to much. It was about then that he took to hanging out with the reprobate Richard Savage, drinking and roaming the streets of London all night. At this time he was in his early thirties, living away from his wife.</p><p>在他成名之前，他是个失败者。他一生都在怨恨他年轻时在伦敦过的贫穷生活。他不得不把他那件干净的衬衫留到下个星期去家访的那一天。他离开牛津大学是因为他付不起学费。他创办并经营了一所失败的学校，在这个过程中损失了妻子的大部分钱。在那之后，他写成那个时代最大悲剧的戏剧《艾琳》就失败了。30岁的他身体状况不太好。就在那时，他开始和堕落的理查德·萨维奇(Richard Savage)闲逛，整晚在伦敦的街道上喝酒和漫步。此时他已三十出头，与妻子分居。</p><p> His poetry was powerful: Harold Bloom thought he could have been Pope&#39;s successor. When  Irene failed he wrote  London, which is still anthologised. But his real genius was not poetry, but judgement and compression. In his mid-thirties he wrote a biography of Savage which is a masterpiece.</p><p>他的诗歌很有力量：哈罗德·布鲁姆(Harold Bloom)认为他本可以成为教皇的继任者。艾琳失败后，他写了《伦敦》，至今仍在选集中。但他真正的天才不是诗歌，而是判断和压缩。35岁左右的时候，他写了一本《萨维奇传》，这是一部杰作。</p><p> The decade from the mid 1740s to the mid 1750s were when he produced the  Dictionary, The Rambler, and  The Vanity of Human Wishes. Three canonical works, each in a different mode: reference, journalism, poetry. At the end of that decade he was arrested for debt. He then worked on his edition of Shakespeare,  The Idler, and  Rasselas, which he wrote ‘in the nights of a week’ to pay for his mother’s funeral. It was an extraordinary fifteen years.</p><p>从17世纪40年代中期到50年代中期的十年里，他出版了《词典》、《漫步者》和《人类愿望的虚荣心》。三部经典作品，每一部都有不同的模式：参考，新闻，诗歌。在那十年末，他因债务被捕。然后，他开始创作他的《莎士比亚》、《游手好闲的人》和《拉塞拉斯》，这本书是他在一周的晚上写的，用来支付母亲的葬礼费用。那是不平凡的十五年。</p><p> And all of this was done without a degree. He was a prodigious reader, alternating his bouts of depression with astonishing industry. Early in the 1760s he was given a government pension, but he still produced  Lives of the Poets. It’s an astonishing record for a man who didn&#39;t even have a degree.</p><p>所有这些都是在没有学位的情况下完成的。他是一个令人惊叹的阅读者，他的一阵阵沮丧与惊人的勤奋交织在一起。早在17世纪60年代，他就得到了政府的退休金，但他仍然创作了《诗人的生活》(Lives Of The Poets)。对于一个连学位都没有的人来说，这是一个惊人的记录。</p><p> His sharp lapidary judgements would have thrived on Twitter and his essays would have been ideal blogs. He finds Milton&#39;s early poetry dissatisfactory, and  Paradise Lost is described as a great poem that &#39;no one ever wished longer&#39;. He was a non elitist, praising the common reader above the professional academic, perhaps unsurprising after Oxford’s snobbish credentialism. He thought interest was the main criteria for assessing a book and gladly threw books aside that lost their appeal.</p><p>他敏锐的宝石般的判断力会在Twitter上大行其道，他的文章也会成为理想的博客。他发现弥尔顿早期的诗歌并不令人满意，《失乐园》被描述为一首伟大的诗歌，没有人再希望它继续存在。他是一个非精英人士，称赞普通读者胜过专业学者，这在牛津大学势利的学位主义之后或许并不令人惊讶。他认为兴趣是评价一本书的主要标准，并欣然将失去吸引力的书扔在一边。</p><p> He is mostly remembered because of Boswell&#39;s biography, which details all sorts of weird and wonderful things about him, like the fact that he always kept his orange peel to put in his shoes, or his strange behaviour, twitching and rolling around and muttering, like he had tourettes. People who met him found his intelligence literally unbelievable after they had observed his ‘strange antic gestures’. He also had terrible eyesight and read with the book very close to his face, so close to the candle he scorched his wig. His friend Thrale worried he would set himself on fire.</p><p>人们之所以记住他，主要是因为博斯韦尔的传记，书中详细描述了关于他的各种奇怪而美妙的事情，比如他总是把橙色的皮放在鞋子里，或者他奇怪的行为，抽搐、打滚和喃喃低语，就像他有秃鹰一样。见过他的人在观察到他的“奇怪的滑稽动作”后，发现他的智商简直令人难以置信。他的视力也很差，看书的时候离他的脸很近，离蜡烛太近了，以至于他的假发被烧焦了。他的朋友斯雷尔担心他会自焚。</p><p> But he ought to be remembered for his writing and his strong minded independence. He was an autodidact, and a powerful example of the  Fitzgerald Rule. Who would have seen the potential in that strange man wandering the streets with Richard Savage, a well known liar and fraud? Only the people who could recognise that he was an opsimath: a lifelong learner and a late bloomer.</p><p>但他应该因为他的写作和坚强的独立性而被铭记。他自学成才，是菲茨杰拉德规则的有力典范。谁会看到那个和理查德·萨维奇(Richard Savage)一起在街上闲逛的陌生男人的潜力呢？萨维奇是一个著名的骗子和骗子。只有那些能意识到他是一位运筹学家的人：一个终生学习的人和一个大器晚成的人。</p><p>  I rejoice to concur with the common reader; for by the common sense of readers uncorrupted with literary prejudices, after all the refinements of subtilty and the dogmatism of learning, must be finally decided all claim to poetical honours.</p><p>我很高兴同意普通读者的看法，因为根据读者的常识，没有文学偏见的读者，在所有的巧妙之处和学术的教条主义之后，最终必须决定所有声称获得诗意荣誉的东西。</p><p>   When we are young we busy ourselves in forming schemes for succeeding time, and miss the gratifications that are before us; when we are old we amuse the languour of age with the recollection of youthful pleasures or performances; so that our life, of which no part is filled with the business of the present time, resembles our dreams after dinner, when the events of the morning are mingled with the designs of the evening.</p><p>当我们年轻的时候，我们忙于为未来制定计划，错过了眼前的满足感；当我们年老的时候，我们用回忆青春的快乐或表演来消磨岁月的疲惫；因此，我们的生活--其中没有现在的事情--就像我们晚饭后的梦，早晨的事情和晚上的计划混在一起。</p><p> If you haven’t read him, try   Johnson on Shakespeare (bookfinder link), one of my favourite books, or dip in and out of his  Rambler and  Idler  Selected Essays ( US link). They’re better than almost all modern journalism, and are full of great lines like, ‘The essence of poetry is invention’ and ‘Probably no-one will ever know whether it is better to wear a nightcap or not’.</p><p>如果你还没有读过他的书，可以试试约翰逊的莎士比亚(Bookheder链接)，这是我最喜欢的书之一，或者浏览他的《漫游者与闲散精选散文》(美国链接)。它们比几乎所有的现代新闻业都要好，而且充满了这样的伟大台词，比如“诗歌的精髓在于发明”和“可能永远不会有人知道戴上睡帽是不是更好”。</p><p>  Thanks for reading.
