Joe Ligon spoke to BBC World Service about spending nearly seven decades in jail, why he waited so long for freedom, and how he intends to spend the rest of his days.</p><p>美国＆＃39; s＆＃34;最长的少年救生员＆＃34;最近走出了一个自由的人。 Joe Ligon与BBC世界服务谈到关于在监狱中支出近七十年，为什么他渴望自由等待，以及他打算如何度过他的余下的日子。</p><p> &#34;I&#39;ve never been alone, but I am a loner. I prefer to be alone as much as I possibly can. Being in prison, I&#39;ve been in a single cell all this time, from the time of my arrest all the way up until my release.</p><p> ＆＃34;我从未孤单，但我是一个孤独的人。我宁愿尽可能多地独自一人。在监狱里，我一直在一个单一的牢房里，从我逮捕一直到我的发布。</p><p> &#34;That helps people like me, who want to be alone - I was the type of person, once I went in the cell and closed the door, whatever was going on, I didn&#39;t see or hear nothing. When we were allowed to have the radio and TV - that was my company.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;这有助于像我这样的人，谁想要独处 - 我是那种人的类型，一旦我进入了细胞并关闭了门，无论发生了什么，我都没有看到或听不到任何声音。当我们被允许拥有收音机和电视 - 那是我的公司。＆＃34;</p><p> It&#39;s perhaps fair to say that prison life rather suited Joe Ligon, to a degree. It allowed him to keep his head down, his mouth shut and out of trouble - all lessons, he says, he has learned in his 68 years behind bars.</p><p> 它可能是公平的，说监狱生活相当适合Joe Ligon，以一定程度。他允许他抬起头，嘴里闭嘴 - 他说，所有课程，他在他的68年后落后了。</p><p> And when it came time to retire to his cell at the end of the day, it didn&#39;t bother him there was no-one else there. In fact, keeping his own company was something of a considered choice.</p><p> 当它在一天结束时来到他的手机时，它就没有打扰他，那里没有其他人。事实上，保持自己的公司是一个被认为的选择。</p><p> &#34;I had no friends inside. I had no friends outside. But most people that I associated with… I treated them as though they were a friend. And we were cool, we were alright with each other,&#34; he says.</p><p> ＆＃34;我没有朋友。外面我没有朋友。但是，大多数人都与......我对待他们，好像他们是朋友。我们很酷，我们互相友好，＆＃34;他说。</p><p>  &#34;But I didn&#39;t use that word friend, I learned that that choice of word means a whole lot to a person like me. And a lot of people say that [if you&#39;re a] friend… you can be making a big mistake.&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;但我没有使用那个词的朋友，我了解到这个词的选择对像我这样的人来说意义重大。很多人都说[如果你＆＃39; re a]朋友......你可以犯一个大错误。＆＃34; </p><p>  Ligon has, by his own admission, always been the solitary sort. Growing up in the country with his maternal grandparents in Birmingham, Alabama, he didn&#39;t have many friends and instead remembers fond times with his family, such as the Sundays they spent together watching his other grandfather preach in a local church.</p><p>利龙通过他自己的入场，始终是孤独的排序。在这个国家在阿拉巴马州的伯明翰母亲祖父母长大，他没有有很多朋友，而是与他的家人一起记得美气时光，例如他们共同看着他在当地教堂的其他祖父宣讲。</p><p> He was 13 when he moved from the deep south to Philadelphia to live in a blue-collar neighbourhood with his nurse mum, mechanic dad and younger brother and sister. He struggled in school and could neither read nor write. He didn&#39;t play sports and as for friends, they weren&#39;t much of a feature.</p><p> 他是13岁，当他从深南到费城生活在一个蓝领邻里，他的护士妈妈，机械师爸爸和弟弟和妹妹。他在学校挣扎，既不读也不写。他没有玩体育和朋友，他们是一个特征的＆＃39;</p><p> &#34;I didn&#39;t do too much hanging out. I was the type of person that had one or two friends, that was it for me - I didn&#39;t go for crowds.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我没有太多闲逛。我是有一个或两个朋友的人，这对我来说 - 我没有去找人群。＆＃34;</p><p>   When Ligon &#34;got into trouble&#34; on a Friday evening in 1953, he didn&#39;t really know the people he was with then either. He had met up with a couple of people he knew casually and as they walked around the neighbourhood, they bumped into some other people who were drinking.</p><p>   当Ligon＆＃34;进入麻烦＆＃34;在1953年的星期五晚上，他没有真正了解他所做的人。他遇到了几个人，他随便知道，随着他们走在邻居，他们碰到了一些正在喝酒的人。</p><p> &#34;We started asking people for some money so we could get some more wine and one thing led to another...&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我们开始向人们询问一些钱，所以我们可以获得更多的葡萄酒，有一件事导致另一件事......＆＃34;</p><p>  He trails off. But he admits the night ended in a stabbing spree in which he was involved, violence which left two people dead and six injured.</p><p>  他走了。但他承认，夜晚结束了他所涉及的刺伤，暴力留下了两人死亡，六人受伤。</p><p> Ligon was the first to be arrested. At the police station, he says he quite truthfully couldn&#39;t tell officers who he had been with that night.</p><p> Ligon是第一个被捕的人。在警察局，他说他非常如此如实地＆＃39; T告诉官员在那天晚上他一直在努力。 </p><p> &#34;Even the two I did know, I didn&#39;t know their names, I knew them by their nicknames.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34;即使是我所知道的两个，我也知道他们的名字，我知道他们的绰号。＆＃34;</p><p> Ligon says he was taken to a police station far from his home in Rodman Street and held for five days, without access to legal help. He says he was angry for a long time that his parents were turned away when they tried to visit.</p><p> 利昂说，他被带到了罗德曼街的房屋的一家派出所，并在没有获得法律帮助的情况下举行五天。他说他很生气了很长一段时间，当他们试图访问时，他的父母被拒绝了。</p><p> That week, the then 15-year-old was charged with murder - an accusation he has always denied although he has since accepted in an interview with US broadcaster CBS that he stabbed someone who survived and has expressed remorse.</p><p> 那一周，当时15岁的孩子被指控谋杀 - 虽然他一直被否认，但他已经被否认，虽然他已经接受了与我们广播公司的采访，他刺伤了一个幸存者并表达了悔恨的人。</p><p> &#34;They [the police] started giving us statements to sign, that implicated me in murder. I didn&#39;t murder anybody.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;他们[警察]开始向我们发表签字，对我毫无意思。我没有谋杀任何人。＆＃34;</p><p>   Pennsylvania is one of six US states where life imprisonment carries no possibility of a parole. Ligon faced what was called a degree of guilt hearing, where he admitted to the facts of the case, and the judge found him guilty on two counts of first degree murder.</p><p>   宾夕法尼亚州是六个美国国家之一，终身监禁没有假释。利贡面临着被称为内疚听力的东西，他承认了案件的事实，而法官发现他有罪的两次谋杀罪。</p><p> The teenager wasn&#39;t in court to hear he had been given mandatory life without parole - not unusual given the sentence was a foregone conclusion at the time. But it meant he went to jail without knowing the full terms of his sentence - and it didn&#39;t occur to him to ask anyone.</p><p> 少年没有在法庭上听到他在没有假释的强制性生活的情况下，没有罕见的判决当时是一个全面的结论。但这意味着他在不知道他的判决的完整条款的情况下，他去了监狱 - 而且它就会向他提出任何人。</p><p> &#34;I didn&#39;t even know what to ask. I know it&#39;s hard to believe but it was the truth,&#34; says Ligon. &#34;I knew I had to do time, but I had no idea I&#39;d be in prison for the rest of my life. I had never even heard the words &#39;life with parole&#39;.</p><p> ＆＃34;我甚至不知道要问的内容。我知道它＆＃39很难相信，但这是真理，＆＃34; Ligon说。 ＆＃34;我知道我不得不做时间，但我不知道我的余生中待在监狱。我甚至从未听过单词＆＃39;生活与假释＆＃39; </p><p> &#34;I&#39;ll tell you how messed up I was as a child - I couldn&#39;t read or write, couldn&#39;t even spell my name. I knew my name was Joe, because that&#39;s what I was referred to as far back as I could remember.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34;我＆＃39; ll告诉你我是多么搞乱我作为一个孩子 - 我无法读或写，不能拼写我的名字＆＃39;甚至拼写我的名字。我知道我的名字是乔，因为那个＆＃39;我所说的是我所记得的东西。＆＃34;</p><p> Ligon says he entered the prison system confused, rather than scared. The main thing on his mind was being away from his family.</p><p> 利昂说他进入监狱系统混淆，而不是害怕。他脑海的主要事情是远离他的家人。</p><p>  As prisoner AE 4126, Ligon seemingly never questioned how much time he had left to serve. He lived in six jails over 68 years, adapting each time to the routine of prison life.</p><p>  作为囚犯AE 4126，利贡看似从未质疑他留下了多少时间。他在68年超过68年里生活在六名监狱里，每次都适应监狱生活的例行。</p><p> &#34;They wake you up at 6 o&#39;clock by the bullhorn, by the voice, &#39;stand up for count, everybody, it&#39;s count time&#39;… 7 o&#39;clock is meal time, 8 o&#39;clock is work time.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;他们在6 o＆＃39唤醒你的钟表，由声音，＆＃39;站起来，每个人，它＆＃39;计数时间＆＃39; ... 7 o＆＃39;时钟是粉末时间，8 o＆＃39;时钟是工作时间。＆＃34;</p><p> Ligon sometimes worked in the kitchen and laundry room, but was for the most part a cleaner. After a midday meal, he reported back to his duties. A roll call again in the evening and dinner marked the remainder of his day - prison life remaining largely the same while the world outside changed irrevocably over the decades.</p><p> 利贡有时在厨房和洗衣房间工作，但是最多的是一个清洁剂。在午餐之后，他报告责任。晚上再次拨打电话，晚餐标志着他的一天中的剩余时间 - 在几十年来的世界外面改变了不可撤销的世界，监狱生活在很大程度上相同。</p><p> &#34;I didn&#39;t mess with drugs, I didn&#39;t drink in jail, I did none of that crazy stuff that causes people to get killed, I didn&#39;t try to escape, I didn&#39;t give nobody a hard time,&#34; he recalls.</p><p> ＆＃34;我没有粘在毒品中，我没有在监狱里喝酒，我没有疯狂的东西导致人们被杀，我没有尝试逃避，我没有＃39; T给没有人艰难的时间，＆＃34;他回忆起。</p><p> &#34;I stayed as humble as I possibly could - what prison has taught me along with many other things is mind your business, always try to do what&#39;s right, stay away from trouble when it&#39;s humanly possible to do.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我留下谦虚 - 我可能会谦卑 - 监狱教导了我和许多其他事情都在于你的事业，总是试着做什么＆＃39;当它＆＃39;人类的麻烦可能做。＆＃34; </p><p>  Some 53 years into his sentence, Ligon was told a lawyer wanted to see him.</p><p>在他的判决中有大约53岁，Ligon被告知一位律师想见他。</p><p> Buoyed by the US Supreme Court&#39;s ruling in 2005 that juveniles couldn&#39;t be executed, Bradley S Bridge had started looking into what he believed would be the next big legal issue to come out of it - juveniles who had been given life without parole.</p><p> 由美国最高法院＆＃39;在2005年的统治中，少年无法执行，布拉德利的桥梁已经开始研究他认为是下一个大的法律问题 - 曾经是少年给予没有假释的生活。</p><p> At the time, Pennsylvania had 525 prisoners in such circumstances which was the highest in the US, according to Bridge. Philadelphia had 325 - and Ligon was its longest serving. The assistant defender arranged to meet him.</p><p> 据桥梁称，当时，宾夕法尼亚州在美国的这种情况下有525名囚犯，这是美国最高的。费城有325  - 而且利贡是它最长的服务。助理后卫安排了与他见面。</p><p> &#34;He was not really aware of his sentence,&#34; says Bridge, from the Defender Association of Philadelphia. &#34;He knew nothing about it until I met with him. It&#39;s kind of interesting he had never given up hope - he was completely optimistic, from the very beginning, always expected that something would be done.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;他并不真正意识到他的判决，＆＃34;来自费城的后卫协会的桥梁说。 ＆＃34;他一无所知，直到我见到他。它有点有趣的是他从未放弃过希望 - 他完全乐观，从一开始，总是预计会做某事。＆＃34;</p><p>  For Ligon, the meeting was eye-opening. When Bridge showed him a copy of the appeal challenging the legal status of his sentence, it was the first time Ligon learned the terms of his incarceration.</p><p>  对于利贡，会议令人眼开。当桥梁向他展示了挑战他判决的法律地位的上诉副本时，这是Ligon首次学会了他的监禁条款。</p><p> &#34;I realised that I was being mistreated from the time of my arrest. And I was taught and I learned that it was unconstitutional to be sentenced [as a juvenile] without the possibility of parole.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我意识到我从我被捕时虐待。而且我被教过，我了解到，没有假释的可能性被判刑[作为少年]是违宪的。＆＃34;</p><p> In 2016, the US Supreme Court ruled all juvenile lifers had to be resentenced. The following year, Ligon was resentenced to 35 years, meaning he could apply for parole due to time served. Bridge urged him to but was met with flat refusal. Ligon felt his sentence had always been unconstitutional, so why should he accept parole, which would mean his liberty was monitored.</p><p> 2016年，美国最高法院裁定所有少年居民必须重新征服。次年，利昂被重入35年，这意味着他可以申请由于时间为由申请假释。桥催促他，但是普通拒绝了。利贡觉得他的判决一直是违宪的，所以为什么他应该接受假释，这意味着他的自由被监测。 </p><p>  Bridge therefore had to challenge the 2017 judgement and eventually took the case to federal court, where in November 2020, the judge ruled in his favour. When Bridge went to Montgomery County to pick Ligon up on 11 February, he found the former inmate remarkably calm.</p><p>因此，桥梁不得不挑战2017年判决，并最终将案件置于联邦法院，在2020年11月，法官统治着他的青睐。当桥梁去蒙哥马利县，于2月11日挑选Ligon，他发现前囚犯非常平静。</p><p> &#34;I would have expected a stronger &#39;oh my god&#39; reaction. But he didn&#39;t have that. No drama, nothing.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我会期待更强大的＆＃39;哦，我的上帝＆＃39;反应。但他没有那个。没有戏剧，什么都没有。＆＃34;</p><p> Ligon was perhaps simply doing what he had done for decades: keeping his thoughts to himself.</p><p> Ligon也许只是在做几十年来完成他所做的事情：让他的想法保持对自己。</p><p> A month since his release, he reflects on the day he left State Correctional Institution Phoenix with a degree of wonder.</p><p> 自从他发布以来的一个月，他反映了他在他离开州惩教机构凤凰的一天以来的奇迹。</p><p>  &#34;It was like being born all over again. Because everything was new to me - just about everything [changed].&#34; Cars and tall buildings especially, he notes.</p><p>  ＆＃34;这就像又一次出生。因为我对我来说都是新的 - 只是关于一切[改变]。＆＃34;他特别注意到汽车和高层建筑。</p><p> The last 68 years have come at a cost to Ligon. He knows he has lost further time by waiting for release without parole - time he could have spent with his family, many of whom have since died.</p><p> 过去68年来利用利贡。他知道他在没有假释的情况下等待释放已经失去了更多的时间 - 他可以与他的家人一起度过的时间，其中许多人已经死了。</p><p> And yet, as this 83-year-old adjusts to what he has waited so long for, he has few plans. Rather, he&#39;s going to stick to what he knows best.</p><p> 然而，正如这83岁的那样调整到他等待的东西，他有很少的计划。相反，他会坚持他最擅长的东西。 </p><p> &#34;I&#39;m gonna do the same thing I&#39;ve been doing my whole life. Give me a job of cleaning, as a janitor.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34;我会做同样的事情我一直在做我的一生。 给我一个清洁工作，作为一个看门人。＆＃34; </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57022924">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57022924</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/ligon/">#ligon</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
