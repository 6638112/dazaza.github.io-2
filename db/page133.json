Supreme Court ruled Friday in a Houston case that Facebook is not a \u201clawless no-man\u2019s-land\u201d and can be held liable for the conduct of pimps who use its technology to recruit and prey on children.\n   The ruling came in a trio of Houston civil actions involving teenage trafficking victims who met their abusive pimps through Facebook\u2019s messaging functions. They sued the California-based social media juggernaut for negligence and product liability, saying that Facebook failed to warn about or attempt to prevent sex trafficking from taking place on its internet platforms. The suits also alleged that Facebook benefited from the sexual exploitation of trafficking victims.\n  The justices said trafficking victims can move forward with lawsuits on the grounds that Facebook violated a provision of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code passed in 2009.\n  Facebook lawyers argued the company was shielded from liability under Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act, which states that what users say or write online is not akin to a publisher conveying the same message. Essentially, they said, Facebook is immune to these types of lawsuits.\n  The majority wrote, \u201cWe do not understand Section 230 to \u2018create a lawless no-man\u2019s-land on the Internet\u2019 in which states are powerless to impose liability on websites that knowingly or intentionally participate in the evil of online human trafficking.\u201d\n  \u201cHolding internet platforms accountable for the words or actions of their users is one thing, and the federal precedent uniformly dictates that Section 230 does not allow it,\u201d the opinion said. \u201cHolding internet platforms accountable for their own misdeeds is quite another thing. This is particularly the case for human trafficking.\u201d\n   The justices explained that Congress recently amended Section 230 to add the possibility of civil liability for websites that violate state and federal human-trafficking laws. They said under the amended law states may protect residents from internet companies that knowingly or intentionally participate in human trafficking through their action or inaction.\n  The  lawsuits were brought by three Houston women recruited as teens through Facebook apps and trafficked as a result of those online connections. The young women said in court filings that the social media giant cloaked traffickers with credibility and provided \u201ca point of first contact between sex traffickers and these children\u201d and \u201can unrestricted platform to stalk, exploit, recruit, groom, and extort children into the sex trade.\u201d\n    One young woman who sued was 15 when a friend of a mutual friend reached out to her on Facebook in 2012. The adult who began messaging her had images on his profile of \u201cscantily-clad young women in sexual positions\u201d with money stuffed in their mouths and \u201cother deeply troubling content,\u201d the justices wrote. She confided in him and he complimented her, offering her a modeling job. After they met in person, the trafficker posted photos of her in prostitution ads on Backpage, an online platform shuttered due to its promotion of human trafficking. The young woman said she was \u201craped, beaten, and forced into further sex trafficking.\u201d\n   Another plaintiff was 14 in 2017 when a man contacted her on Instagram, another Facebook property. The pimp in this instance lured her with \u201cfalse promises of love and a better future.\u201d She said the easy access to her through social media made it possible for the man to traffic her, using Instagram to advertise her as a prostitute and set up \u201cdates,\u201d during which she was raped numerous times. After the teen was rescued from his operation, traffickers kept using her profile to lure in other minors, according to the ruling. In this case the family says the girl\u2019s mother reported what had happened to Facebook and the company never responded.\n  The third girl who sued identified herself as being 14 on Instagram in 2016. A man of about 30 whom she didn\u2019t know sent her a friend request on Instagram. They exchanged messages for two years in what plaintiffs said was a calculated effort to \u201cgroom\u201d her and prepare her for sex-trafficking. In March 2018, the man asked the teen to leave home and meet him. He brought the girl to a motel, photographed her and posted images in Backpage ads, according to the opinion. The johns who responded to the post raped her.\n       Annie McAdams, a lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said it was a groundbreaking decision. This is the first case to beat Facebook on its argument that it had immunity under Section 230, she said.\n   \u201cWhile we have a long road ahead, we are grateful that the Texas Supreme Court will allow these courageous trafficking survivors to have their day in court against Facebook,\u201d McAdams said. She said with the help of an anti-trafficking provision under the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code called Chapter 98, \u201cWe believe trafficking survivors in Texas can expose and hold accountable businesses such as Facebook that benefit from these crimes of exploitation.\u201d\n  A Facebook spokesperson said in a statement that the company is considering possible next steps.\n  \u201cSex trafficking is abhorrent and not allowed on Facebook,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe will continue our fight against the spread of this content and the predators who engage in it.\u201d\n  Gabrielle Banks covers federal court for the Houston Chronicle.

People love the concept of the back-up camera or automatic parking. Other, more opaque features like rear cross-traffic alert (which needs a definition to understand) didn\u2019t register as much interest.\n   More people are concerned about autonomous vehicles than they are excited. It\u2019ll take more convincing and safety assurances to get people involved.\n  People have expectations for how they plan on using autonomous cars, so those cars should cater to those expectations and use those expectations to clarify the benefits of owning or using AV tech.\n Consumers feel that Tesla is most likely to develop safe AV tech, but at the same time, consumers are  also\u00a0more likely to lose trust in a brand that overpromises and underdelivers.\n   It is important to note that fully-autonomous technology is  not available right now. We don\u2019t have that technology. We aren\u2019t really close to having that technology. All driver assist systems on the market right now require a degree of human input and monitoring to function smoothly \u2014 so this autonomous future is still quite a few years away.\n Weekends at Jalopnik.

Almost everyone had been working at home since the firm was started in spring 2020, so when the founder, Chris James, went into the office for a rare visit on May 26 this year to watch the results during Exxon Mobil\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, he propped his computer up on a rented desk. As an activist investor, he had bought millions of dollars\u2019 worth of shares in Exxon Mobil to put forward four nominees to the board. His candidates needed to finish in the top 12 of the 16 up for election, and he was nervous. Since December, James and the firm\u2019s head of active engagement, Charlie Penner, had been making their case that America\u2019s most iconic oil company needed new directors to help it thrive in an era of mounting climate urgency. In response, Exxon Mobil expanded its board to 12 directors from 10 and announced a $3 billion investment in a new initiative it called Low Carbon Solutions. James paced around the empty office and texted Penner: \u201cI was doing bed karate this morning thinking about how promises made at gunpoint are rarely kept. Exxon only makes promises at gunpoint.\u201d\n  At his apartment in TriBeCa, Penner, who had conceived and run the campaign since its inception, was obsessively focused on making sure that even the last moments before the annual meeting were used strategically. For weeks he had kept a tally of whom he thought big shareholders would back, but because they could change their votes until the polls closed there would be no certainty until the end. He had stayed up late the previous night writing a speech to give during the five minutes he was allotted to address shareholders, scribbling in longhand in a spiral notebook. He was hearing from major investors that the company was mounting a last-minute push, calling shareholders to swing the vote in its favor.\n Penner took a quick shower and sat down at his desk for his speech. He had been sitting at the same spot since the start of the pandemic, holding virtual meetings to drum up support for Engine No. 1\u2019s four nominees. Doubling down on fossil fuels as society tries to decarbonize was only one criticism he levied against Exxon Mobil; he also underscored the company\u2019s declining profitability and the fact that, when the campaign started, no one on the board had experience in the energy industry. When the meeting began, Penner was the first shareholder to speak. \u201cRather than being open to the idea of adding qualified energy experience to its board, we believe Exxon Mobil once again closed ranks,\u201d he said. Driving humanity off a cliff wasn\u2019t good business practice anymore, he added, and shareholders knew it.\n  Forty minutes after the meeting started, Exxon Mobil called for an hourlong recess. It was an unusual move; shareholders couldn\u2019t remember the company suspending an annual meeting right in the middle of the proceedings. It had been a bruising year for the industry, with oil prices trading negative last spring and record numbers of shareholder votes pressing major, publicly traded petroleum companies to prepare for a zero-carbon world. Just that morning, as the meeting was starting, the news broke that a Dutch court had declared that Shell must accelerate its emissions-reduction efforts. As Exxon Mobil\u2019s meeting was underway, so was Chevron\u2019s, and shareholders there voted in favor of a proposal to reduce the emissions generated by the company\u2019s product, which would call for a re-evaluation of the core business. Exxon Mobil\u2019s management had appeared confident about the activist threat, but in the last moments of the battle, it seemed that assurance was flagging.\n During the break, company management and sitting board members continued making calls to some of the largest investors. Exxon Mobil said it was explaining to shareholders how to vote. The Engine No. 1 crew, huddled around laptops in their office or alone in front of their screens across the country, started speculating about what was going on \u2014 they suspected that Exxon Mobil executives saw the vote counts coming in and wanted to buy themselves time to try to make up for a shortfall. Penner texted James and told him to get an Exxon Mobil board member on the phone. \u201cSeriously, tie them up if you can,\u201d he wrote. Engine No. 1 sent out a statement criticizing the company for using \u201ccorporate machinery\u201d to undercut the process. James was incredulous.  Is this legal? he kept thinking.  Can they really do this? An Engine No. 1 public-relations adviser started shouting on the phone at a CNBC producer who didn\u2019t seem to be sufficiently appreciating the significance of the moment. A few minutes later,  Penner went live on air. \u201cThis is classic skulduggery,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not the way to move this company forward.\u201d\n  When the meeting reconvened, Exxon Mobil\u2019s chief executive, Darren Woods, sounded hoarse and weary. He took questions for nearly an hour and then abruptly stopped talking so that the election results could be announced. Almost all the people at Engine No. 1 had their heads in their hands, and they went still while the list was read. One of their candidates, Greg Goff, was an oilman who had led a smaller refining company to legendary profitability and thought that mitigating environmental harm was part of corporate responsibility. Goff was elected. So was Kaisa Hietala, a former vice president for renewable energy at Neste, a Finnish petroleum company.\n But Penner started shaking his head in exasperation \u2014 what about the other two candidates? Andy Karsner, an energy entrepreneur, was still in the running; the vote was too close to call. Anders Runevad, a former wind-power chief executive, was out. Penner didn\u2019t have the final tally, but it was now clear that  at least two seats had been wrested from management. Engine No. 1 had gained a foothold at the board of Exxon Mobil based largely on the strength of its argument that failing to plan for the impact of climate change could spell the demise of a business. Penner, usually subdued, raised a clenched fist.\n  In the corporate world, successful proxy battles are the equivalent of shareholder insurrection. Usually motivated by displeasure with management, activist investors in a company can put forward proposals, including board candidates, to be voted on at companies\u2019 annual meetings. Investors have taken activist stances in their companies at least since a shareholder named Isaac Le Maire started complaining about money management at the Dutch East India Company in 1609. But the practice was weaponized in the United States during the 1980s, when a set of ambitious moneymakers conducted what were eventually called corporate raids, intended to pump up the value of a company\u2019s stock even if that meant carving up the business.\n  Famous activist investors, like Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman, are often seen as predatory, but they are skilled at reading a company\u2019s vulnerabilities and marshaling shareholder dissatisfaction. Because recruiting and putting forward a slate of candidates is expensive and time-consuming, though, investors often try to engage with a company behind the scenes before initiating proxy battles for board seats. \u201cIn terms of corporate America, it\u2019s very aggressive,\u201d said Jeff Gramm, author of the 2016 book \u201cDear Chairman: Boardroom Battles and the Rise of Shareholder Activism.\u201d Companies have been known to respond with comparable aggression, holding annual meetings in remote locations or adjourning them suddenly to stifle dissent.\n While activist investing typically focuses on a company\u2019s financials, socially minded investors have used the levers available to them to press for fairer business practices. Shareholders need to hold only a small stake in a company to put forward a resolution, but disputed proposals have to be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has rules limiting shareholder influence over day-to-day business operations. Depending on the disposition of a company\u2019s management, though, sometimes even a small amount of shareholder disquiet is enough to change a company\u2019s behavior. In 1969, a civil rights organization of doctors and nurses filed a proposal at the Dow Chemical Company to stop selling napalm for use as a weapon; the S.E.C. backed the company\u2019s decision to block the proposal from reaching the annual meeting. Dow stopped producing napalm for the U.S. military that year.\n In the past few years, an increasing number of proposals have aimed to pressure large corporations, and especially oil-and-gas companies, to respond to climate change; more than 1,600 such proposals have been filed since 2010. Of those, less than half were put to a vote, and just a tiny sliver gained majority support; even successful resolutions are nonbinding, so companies can still dismiss them afterward. But when an activist wins board seats, companies have to choke back their dissatisfaction and accept their new directors.\n Because the rules for filing a shareholder proposal are different in Europe, generally requiring a bigger stake in the company but not dependent on approval by a regulator, investors have submitted more ambitious climate proposals at the major oil companies there. In 2015, a Dutch activist named Mark van Baal started raising money to buy shares in Shell, and the next year, he went in front of shareholders with demands that the company invest its profits in renewable energy and \u201ctake the lead in creating a world without fossil fuels.\u201d\n The resolution convinced only 2.7 percent of Shell shareholders, but van Baal returned again with a proposal to put the company\u2019s trajectory in line with the goals set out in the Paris climate accord \u2014 the 2015 global agreement committing countries to aim to keep global temperatures below a 1.5-degree-Celsius increase and not allow them to rise more than a maximum of two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels \u2014 and this one garnered 6.3 percent shareholder support. Van Baal saw his approach as an incremental slow burn; as his proposals gained more support at each annual meeting, companies had little choice but to respond and adapt. Last year, many of the major European oil companies, including BP, Shell and Total, said they intended to cut carbon-dioxide emissions to net zero by 2050.\n At Engine No. 1, Penner was sensitive to coming across as a fire-breathing activist investor during the Exxon Mobil campaign. But the core of his argument rested on mobilizing shareholders with classic activist tactics: focusing on the company\u2019s financials, underscoring its flagging profitability and setting out an argument for how to raise the value of the company\u2019s stock by making smarter expenditures. He didn\u2019t aim to undercut the core business necessarily; rather than urging Exxon Mobil to give up all oil and gas, he wanted the company to practice what finance people like to call \u201ccapital discipline,\u201d which basically just means not spending prodigiously. He also reasoned that, given mounting pressure from society and governments to decarbonize the global economy, it would be strategically smarter for Exxon Mobil to be part of an energy transition, rather than letting itself be outstripped by other companies innovating to meet demand for low-carbon power. There might still be money in oil now, but Penner and James wanted to convince shareholders that the key to profitability involved taking a longer view on the health of the business.\n That argument reflected the changing nature of investment and the increasingly powerful role that large funds play in corporate decisions. Three of the largest asset managers, BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, own nearly 20 percent of Exxon Mobil. Big pension funds, including the California and New York state funds, also own stakes in the company. The New York state comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, said that the basis of his fund\u2019s engagement with Exxon Mobil was about making sure that its investments would remain fiscally sound over the next 100 years. Once a portfolio is big enough, the risk exacerbated by one part can also start threatening other positions. \u201cDiversification is meant to be one of our risk-management tools,\u201d said Anne Simpson, managing investment director of California\u2019s state pension fund. \u201cBut if you\u2019re facing systemic risk, you can run, but you can\u2019t hide. In other words, we can decide not to hold a company that\u2019s producing emissions \u2014 that\u2019s the divestment case. However, if the emissions continue, we\u2019re still exposed to the risk of climate change.\u201d\n In many ways, Exxon Mobil had made itself an ideal target. Before the proxy battle started, the company\u2019s directors were primarily former chief executives from other industries like pharmaceuticals and insurance. With plans to increase oil-and-gas production by 25 percent over the next five years, the company seemed out of step with the market. Profitability had already been slipping for a decade. Exxon Mobil earned the largest annual profit in U.S. history in 2008 and nearly eclipsed that record in 2012; last year it lost $22 billion.\n In part, the loss was due to a historic $19 billion write-down on the value of its assets. That assessment may still be too rosy;  a whistle-blower reportedly told the S.E.C. in January that Exxon Mobil had overvalued its assets by at least $56 billion, in part by pressuring employees to inflate expectations about the drilling timelines in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, which remains the company\u2019s U.S. cash cow. (Exxon Mobil called the claims \u201cdemonstrably false.\u201d) Although it managed to keep shareholders\u2019 dividends intact \u2014 mostly by cutting costs, including announcing thousands of layoffs \u2014 the company\u2019s stock value plunged in 2020 by 40 percent, its market valuation taking a $120 billion drop. The company has more than $60 billion in debt, borrowed to fund purchases of its own stock to buoy its price and to pay out stockholder dividends. Despite the buybacks, and a significant improvement in the stock\u2019s value since late last year, it is still nearly 30 percent lower than it was five years ago. After almost a century on the Dow Jones industrial average, the corporation that descended from John D. Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil was replaced last August by a tech company.\n Chris James, the lanky and energetic 51-year-old founder of Engine No. 1, didn\u2019t establish his firm to go after Exxon Mobil. A tech investor who speaks in the parlance of Silicon Valley start-up culture, James decided in 2019 to abandon his hedge fund and seek to reconcile what he saw as an uncomfortable tension between the consequences of his work and his volunteering at a San Francisco homelessness nonprofit. On a hunting trip near his cattle ranch near Jackson, Wyo., James decided to go into impact investing and start a new firm dedicated to reimagining the concept of value. The firm would create an E.T.F., or exchange-traded fund, and then vote actively in favor of positive measures at the companies included in it. It would also have a private offering. For James, the goal was to build something that could convey his belief that the effect a company had on society would determine its long-term success. He was influenced by  a 2017 paper by the economists Oliver Hart and Luigi Zingales that rejected Milton Friedman\u2019s canonical argument,  published in 1970 in this magazine, that companies should focus exclusively on making money; they instead posited that shareholder welfare includes more than just market worth.\n A few months later, in late 2019, James met Penner, now 48, at his office in New York City, having been introduced through a mutual acquaintance. Studious and analytical, Penner had just come off an activist campaign he led as a hedge-fund partner, pressuring Apple to improve parental controls on its smartphones. He also led an effort, resolved privately, to persuade McDonald\u2019s to offer plant-based burgers. A committed campaigner with a deep sense of what he thought constituted right action, Penner had already set his sights on Exxon Mobil, and he was talking to investors who might be interested in taking on the oil company. James told Penner he should join his new firm, which hadn\u2019t yet opened, and spearhead a proxy contest. Penner left his job at Jana Partners, a hedge fund in New York, and joined James in spring 2020. They would take until December to find nominees for the board and articulate a strategy to persuade shareholders. Penner already sensed that Exxon Mobil was an industry outlier, more reluctant than others to recognize that if the world enacted the emissions reductions that its governments had committed to, there would be no viable business for a publicly traded oil company in 30 years.\n \u2018Do you know how you\u2019re going to fulfill your business plan without burning down the planet?\u2019 Penner asked.\n As they planned the campaign, James retreated from San Francisco to his ranch and spent the summer learning about what it would mean to rejigger the way society powers itself. What he found astounded him. As a tech investor, he was used to innovations growing on an S-curve, with a long tail of early adopters that suddenly became mainstream. Through conversations with experts, researchers and power-grid operators, he began to see potential energy-sector S-curves everywhere. Grids often rely on natural gas to help bridge over times of peak energy consumption, for example, but James talked to experts who said battery technology had advanced enough that it was poised to replace gas by storing renewably produced energy for later use. Internal-combustion engines in cars waste around 75 percent of the energy produced burning gasoline. James became convinced that, because electric vehicles use energy much more efficiently, they would simply beat out everything else in the market. He had initially thought that, optimistically, maybe half the cars on roads would be electric in the next two decades; now he revised it up to at least 80 percent. \u201cAt a price point in the energy transition,\u201d James said, \u201cadoption could just explode.\u201d\n One of the most difficult parts of building a system powered by something other than hydrocarbons is that it\u2019s not clear what technology will outpace others in the market; from the perspective of oil executives, that means any particular path is fraught with potentially costly missteps. Companies like Exxon Mobil have more readily committed to reducing emissions intensity by lowering the amount of carbon released per unit of gas or oil than agreed to reduce absolute emissions. Still, in order to keep global warming under certain thresholds, there\u2019s only so much more carbon dioxide that can be emitted into the atmosphere. According to most experts, annual carbon emissions must start declining in the next few years, be halved by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 in order to stay within that budget. But in the largest areas of fossil-fuel consumption, which include transportation, buildings, industrial manufacturing and power generation, there are still unresolved problems about how to decarbonize.\n Because the cost of wind and solar power has fallen so much over the last 10 years, to the point that they can compete with natural gas and coal, converting power grids to renewable energy and then electrifying as much as possible is one of the most popular routes to zero carbon. The approach could work in transportation with electric vehicles, but also in buildings, if gas-and-oil-consuming appliances and heating systems are systematically replaced with electrics and heat pumps. That would mean substituting the notion of energy efficiency, which still ultimately relies on fossil fuels, with the goal of emissions efficiency. \u201cThe shorthand for decarbonization is\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:24:58", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7f8e\u5b5a,mobil", "title": "\u57c3\u514b\u68ee\u7f8e\u5b5a\u5728\u80a1\u4e1c\u5927\u4f1a\u4e0a\u53d7\u5230\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bb6\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u7684\u6311\u6218 ", "title_en": "Exxon Mobil Challenged by Activist Investors at Its Shareholder Meeting", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/23/magazine/exxon-mobil-engine-no-1-board.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u5b5a", "mobil"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c9bba27666a4b9d99cc07369363491b6.jpg", "infoid": 1068576, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fdd\u62a4\u7fa4\u4f53\u8bf4\uff0c\u5728\u6355\u98df\u8005\u6740\u6b7b\u6d77\u9e1f\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u5c9b\u5c7f\u4e0a\u4fdd\u7559\u6fd2\u4e34\u706d\u7edd\u7684\u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a\u9b54\u9b3c\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u5df2\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5730\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u3002\n \u5c11\u6570\u9b54\u9b3c\u88ab\u8fd0\u5f80\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5c9b\u4e1c\u90e8\u7684\u739b\u4e3d\u4e9a\u5c9b\uff0c2012\u5e74\u3002\n \u65e8\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u54fa\u4e73\u52a8\u7269\u514d\u53d7\u81f4\u547d\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u764c\u75c7\uff0c\u4f7f\u4ed6\u4eec\u9677\u5165\u706d\u7edd\u3002\n  \u5bf9\u5c9b\u5c7f\u7684\u9b54\u9b3c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\uff06\uff0334;\u6839\u636e\u9e1f\u7c7b\u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5dde\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u591a\u4e2a\u9e1f\u7c7b\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u591a\u4e2a\u9e1f\u7c7b\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\n  \u5f15\u7528\u653f\u5e9c\u8c03\u67e5\uff0cBirdlife Tasmania\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e00\u7fa4\u5c0f\u4f01\u9e45\uff0c2012\u5e74\u7f16\u53f73,000\u5bf9\u80b2\u79cd\u5bf9\u3002\n  \uff06\uff0334;\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c9b\u5c7f\u4e0a\u4e22\u59313,000\u5bf9\u4f01\u9e45\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u516c\u56ed\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u907f\u96be\uff0c\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u6253\u51fb\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u8be5\u96c6\u56e2\u7814\u7a76\u5458\u57c3\u91cc\u514b\u00b7\u6c83\u5c14\u52d2\u535a\u58eb\u8bf4\u3002\n \u6c83\u5c14\u52d2\u535a\u58eb\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9274\u4e8e\u54fa\u4e73\u52a8\u7269\u5f15\u5165\u6d77\u6d0b\u5c9b\u5c7f\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u4e0d\u5947\u602a\u3002 \n2011\u5e74\uff0c\u7531\u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a\u4e3b\u8981\u4ea7\u4e1a\u90e8\uff0c\u516c\u56ed\uff0c\u6c34\u548c\u73af\u5883\u90e8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4efd\u9b54\u9b3c\u7684\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9b54\u9b3c\u4f1a\u6709\uff06\uff0334;\u5bf9\u739b\u4e3d\u4e9a\u5c9b\u7684\u5c0f\u4f01\u9e45\u548c\u7267\u8349\u6b96\u6c11\u5730\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd;\n \u53bb\u5e74\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u7269\u4fdd\u62a4\u671f\u520a\u4e0a\u53d1\u8868\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9b54\u9b3c\u6709\uff06\uff0334;\u6d88\u9664\uff06\uff0334;\u7267\u7f8a\u72ac\u6b96\u6c11\u5730\uff0c\u4e00\u53ea\u6d77\u9e1f\u3002\n \uff06\uff0334;\u975e\u5e38\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u9b54\u9b3c\u5bf9\u739b\u4e3d\u4e9a\u5c9b\u4e0a\u7684\u9e1f\u7c7b\u52a8\u7269\u7fa4\u4f53\u6709\u707e\u96be\u6027\u7684\u751f\u6001\u5f71\u54cd;\u6c83\u5c14\u52d2\u535a\u58eb\u8bf4\u3002\n   \u5982\u679c\u4ed6\u4eec\u907f\u514d\u6355\u83b7\u764c\u75c7\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u91ce\u5916\u751f\u6d3b\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e94\u5e74\n  \u54fa\u4e73\u52a8\u7269\u88ab\u62ef\u6551\u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a\u9b54\u9b3c\u8ba1\u5212\uff08STDP\uff09\uff0c\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u548c\u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a\u653f\u5e9c\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5021\u8bae\u642c\u5230\u4e86\u5c9b\u5c7f\u3002\n  \u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a\u9b54\u9b3c\u7531IUCN\u7ea2\u8272\u5217\u8868\u88ab\u5f52\u7c7b\u4e3a\u6fd2\u4e34\u706d\u7edd\u7684\u7269\u79cd\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u52a8\u7269\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u72b6\u51b5\u4e0a\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u3002\n \u4f46\u6c83\u5c14\u52d2\u535a\u58eb\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u5728\u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a\u548c\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u5927\u9646\u6062\u590d\u8fc7\uff0c\u9b54\u9b3c\u5728\u4e0a\u4e2a\u6708\u51e0\u5343\u5e74\u4e2d\u9996\u6b21\u51fa\u751f\u3002 \n\u636e\u9274\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u6c83\u970d\u52d2\u535a\u58eb\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ece\u739b\u4e3d\u4e9a\u5c9b\u4e0a\u5220\u9664\u54fa\u4e73\u52a8\u7269\uff06\uff0334;\u6ca1\u6709\u5bf9\u9b54\u9b3c\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u4e0d\u5229\u540e\u679c\u3002  \u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a\u653f\u5e9c\u53d1\u8a00\u4eba\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u8ba1\u5212\u5c06\uff06\uff0334;\u7ee7\u7eed\u7b26\u5408\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u65b0\u5174\u4f18\u5148\u4e8b\u9879\u7684\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\uff0334;

said Dr Eric Woehler, a researcher for the group.\n Dr Woehler said the outcome was no surprise given what research shows about the introduction of mammals to oceanic islands.\n  In 2011, a report by the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment suggested the introduction of devils would have &#34;a negative impact on little penguin and shearwater colonies on Maria Island&#34;.\n Last year,  a paper published in the Biological Conservation journal said the devils had &#34;eliminated&#34; a colony of shearwater, a species of sea bird.\n &#34;It&#39;s very clear that the devils have had a catastrophic ecological impact on the bird fauna on Maria Island,&#34; Dr Woehler said.\n   They can live for more than five years in the wild, if they avoid catching cancer\n  The mammals were moved to the island under the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program (STDP), a joint initiative of the Australian and Tasmanian governments.\n  Tasmanian devils are classified as an endangered species by  the IUCN Red List, which keeps a database on the conservation status of animals.\n But Dr Woehler said their numbers had recovered in Tasmania and on the Australian mainland, where devils were born for the first time in thousands of years last month.\n  Given this, Dr Woehler said removing the mammals from Maria Island would &#34;not have any adverse consequences for the devil&#34;.\n A Tasmanian government spokesperson said the programme would &#34;continue to evolve in line with new knowledge in science and emerging priorities&#34;.\n However, the spokesperson said, &#34;Maria Island remains an important part of the broader devil programme to help restore and maintain an enduring and resilient wild devil population in Tasmania.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:24:14", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a,protect,\u9b54\u9b3c", "title": "\u4fdd\u62a4\u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a\u9b54\u9b3c\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u5c9b\u672c\u7684\u4f01\u9e45\u4eba\u53e3 ", "title_en": "Effort To Protect Tasmanian Devils Devastates Island's Penguin Population", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-57558396", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a", "protect", "\u9b54\u9b3c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "b5e8a7cba9e21c1c6d825d160c30ae88.jpeg", "infoid": 1068575, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\uff08CNN\uff09\u4f60\u73b0\u5728\u5728\u54ea\u91cc\uff0c\u706b\u661f\u806a\u660e\u7684\u76f4\u5347\u673a\uff1f\u867d\u7136\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u5c0f\u65a9\u6ce2\u5668\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b89\u9759\uff0c\u4f46\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u806a\u660e\u624d\u667a\u5df2\u7ecf\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u822a\u73ed - \u751a\u81f3\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u524d\u4e00\u4e2a\u90ca\u6e38\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u4ee4\u4eba\u8ba8\u538c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n \u6839\u636eTeddy Tzanetos\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c4\u78c5\u7684\u76f4\u5347\u673a\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5728\u706b\u661f\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u5730\u98de\u884c\u4e86\u516b\u6b21Mars\uff0c\u76f4\u5347\u673a\u8fd0\u8425\u5728\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5dde\u5e15\u8428\u8fea\u7eb3\u7684\u55b7\u5c04\u63a8\u8fdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u3002\n \u5728\u5176\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u90ca\u6e38\uff0c\u806a\u660e\u7684\u98de\u5411\u5357\u90e8\u548c\u4e1c\u5357\u90e8\u7684525\u82f1\u5c3a\uff08160\u7c73\uff09\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u573a\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u8fde\u7fd8\uff06\uff0339;\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2a\u822a\u73ed\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u6f14\u793a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u806a\u660e\u624d\u667a\u6b63\u5728\u8bc1\u660e\u5b83\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4fa6\u5bdf\u7684\u6709\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5e72\u6270\u575a\u6301\u4e0d\u61c8\u7684\u6d41\u52a8\u7ad9\uff06\uff0339;\u79d1\u5b66\u4f7f\u547d - \u5bfb\u627e\u706b\u661f\u4e0a\u53e4\u4ee3\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\n         \u806a\u660e\u624d\u667a\u7ee7\u7eed\u505a\u5f97\u597d\uff0c\u56e2\u961f\u8ba1\u5212\u8ba1\u5212\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u822a\u73ed\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c06\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u76f4\u5347\u673a\u73b0\u5728\u6b63\u5728\u505a\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u7684\u9ebb\u70e6\uff06\uff0334;\u770b\u95e8\u72d7\uff06\uff0334;\u8f6f\u4ef6\u95ee\u9898\u5df2\u5f97\u5230\u4fee\u590d\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u5728\u7b2c\u516b\u6b21\u98de\u884c\u524d\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u3002\n  \u770b\u95e8\u72d7\u95ee\u9898\u53d1\u751f\u5728Engenuity\uff06\uff0339;

While it seems like the little chopper has been quiet, it turns out that Ingenuity has aced more of its flights -- and even got a software update to fix an annoying issue that impacted some of its previous outings.\n The 4-pound helicopter has successfully flown eight times on Mars as of June 21, according to an update from  Teddy Tzanetos, the helicopter operations lead at NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\n On its latest outing, Ingenuity flew 525 feet (160 meters) to the south and southeast to a new airfield. This was the copter&#39;s third flight of the operations demo phase, in which Ingenuity is proving its usefulness as an aerial scout without interfering with the  Perseverance rover&#39;s science mission -- searching for evidence of ancient life on Mars.\n         Ingenuity continues to do well, and the team is planning for more flights that will push its capabilities. And the helicopter is doing even better now that its troublesome &#34;watchdog&#34; software issue has been fixed. That was deployed before the eighth flight.\n  The watchdog issue occurred before Ingenuity&#39;s first flight in April. Essentially, this watchdog timer acts like a safe mode when it detects a timing issue, preventing the helicopter&#39;s software from moving into flight mode and allowing the chopper blades to reach full speed or ascend.\n While a temporary workaround was developed to bypass this issue, it was still possible that the watchdog timer would go off 15% of the time.\n Last week, the helicopter&#39;s team successfully deployed a flight software update to Ingenuity to permanently fix the issue, providing more reliability as future flights are planned.\n &#34;Flight 8 confirmed that the FC flight software update was a success and that Ingenuity is ready to proceed with confidence into the next flights of the ops demo,&#34; according to an update from Tzanetos.\n   Ingenuity is also due for a navigation computer software update that will fix the issue that occurred during the chopper&#39;s sixth flight. Images captured by the navigation camera, which feed into the helicopter&#39;s navigation computer, had timing delays. Those images help Ingenuity to track its location, among other critical factors during flight. When the incorrect times and images were associated, it caused the chopper to wobble in the air.\n Sign up for CNN&#39;s Wonder Theory science newsletter.  Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n  Ingenuity was able to land safely, but the team wants to prevent the issue from happening again so the chopper doesn&#39;t spiral out of control. It&#39;s also why the helicopter didn&#39;t capture any color images during its last two flights.\n    &#34;This update will provide a mechanism for the Helicopter to detect and correct when image timestamps in the pipeline become out-of-synch/are dropped/skipped, while also re-enabling the capture of high-resolution 13-megapixel color images. This update is planned to occur in the coming days, followed by Ingenuity&#39;s ninth flight on Mars,&#34; Tzanetos wrote.\n Although Ingenuity has already achieved the goals initially set by its team during its first few flights, the chopper continues to push the limits of what it can do -- and tag along with the Perseverance rover as it explores the site of an ancient lake bed on Mars.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:23:57", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8f6f\u4ef6,\u83b7\u53d6,software", "title": "Mars Indenuity Helicopter\u5b8c\u6210\u7b2c8\u4e2a\u822a\u73ed\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u8f6f\u4ef6\u66f4\u65b0 ", "title_en": "Mars Ingenuity Helicopter Completes 8th Flight, Gets Software Updates", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/25/world/mars-helicopter-flight-updates-scn/index.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8f6f\u4ef6", "\u83b7\u53d6", "software"]}]
