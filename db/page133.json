And while that kind of exclusivity deal had been  hinted at and  heavily suspected by many since  Microsoft&#39;s $7.5 billion acquisition of Bethesda&#39;s parent company, the announcement still came as sad news for PlayStation 5 owners hoping to play  the upcoming space epic. Bethesda Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications Pete Hines said he can certainly understand how PS5 owners must feel. In  a video interview with GameSpot Wednesday, he offered his sympathy and an apology to PS5 owners upset about the move.\n &#34;I don&#39;t know how to allay the concerns of consumer and PlayStation 5 fans other than to say I&#39;m a PlayStation 5 player as well and I&#39;ve played games on that console and there&#39;s games I&#39;m going to continue to play on it,&#34; Hines said. &#34;But if you want to play  Starfield [it&#39;s] Xbox and PC. Sorry. All I can say is I apologize because I&#39;m certain that that&#39;s frustrating to folks, but there&#39;s not a whole lot I can do about it.&#34;\n  At the same time, Hines seemed to suggest that Xbox Cloud Gaming could provide a way for players who don&#39;t have an Xbox or a gaming PC to access  Starfield through the &#34;Xbox ecosystem.&#34; Hines mentioned that Xbox chief Phil Spencer &#34;has talked about how they&#39;re looking to expand that and... looking to bring Xbox games to folks who don&#39;t own a Series S or X or even a PC but want to play the games that we&#39;re bringing to Game Pass.&#34; That&#39;s an apparent reference to  Microsoft&#39;s recently announced plans to expand Xbox Cloud Gaming to many Smart TVs and generic web browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Edge.\n    Hines also said\u00a0 Starfield&#39;s exclusivity could help its developers focus on the gameplay experience rather than compatibility with additional platforms. &#34;I&#39;m here to tell you, and any [developer] will tell you this, [when] you go to fewer platforms, your development gets more streamlined,&#34; he said. &#34;You&#39;re not worrying about, &#39;Well, how does it work on this box versus how does it work on that box...&#39; We&#39;re not making it on that box, so it just needs to run as well as possible on this one [and] on a PC. A narrow focus always helps...&#34;\n    That statement echoes comments Bethesda producer Todd Howard  made to The Telegraph this week, when he said that &#34;by focusing on those platforms [Xbox and PC], you really get to lean in a lot on making it the best it can be for those systems.&#34;\n In that interview, Howard also said he had &#34;a little bit&#34; of reservation about not having a PS5 version of  Starfield. &#34;You don\u2019t ever want to leave people out, right?&#34; But Howard also suggested that Xbox Cloud Gaming means &#34;we see it actually opening up more and more and more so that people\u2019s ability to play our games\u2014via Game Pass and other things\u2014their ability to play our games doesn\u2019t go down.

a graph-centric database and related products, announced today that it raised $325 million at a more than $2 billion valuation in a Series F deal led by Eurazeo, with additional capital from Alphabet\u2019s venture wing GV. Eurazeo managing director Nathalie Kornhoff-Br\u00fcls will join the company\u2019s board of directors.\n  That funding makes Neo4j among the most well-funded database companies in history, with a collective fundraise haul of more than half a billion dollars. For comparison, MongoDB, which trades on Nasdaq,  raised $311 million in total according to Crunchbase before its IPO. Meanwhile, Cockroach Labs of CockroachDB fame has  now raised $355 million in funding, including  a $160 million round earlier this year at a similar $2 billion valuation.\n The past decade has seen a whole new crop of next-generation database models, from scale-out SQL to document to key-value stores to time series and on and on and on. What makes graph databases like Neo4j unique is their focus on the connections between individual data entities. Graph-based data models have become central to modern machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, and are now widely used by data analysts in applications as diverse as marketing to fraud detection.\n CEO and co-founder Emil Eifrem said that Neo4j, which was founded back in 2007, has hit its growth stride in recent years given the rising popularity of graph-based analysis. \u201cWe have a deep developer community of hundreds of thousands of developers actively building applications with Neo4j in any given month, but we also have a really deep data science community,\u201d he said.\n In the past, most business analysis was built on relational databases. Yet, inter-connected complexity is creeping in everywhere, and that\u2019s where Eifrem believes Neo4j has a durable edge. As an example, \u201cany company that ships stuff is tapping into this global fine-grain mesh spanning continent to continent,\u201d he suggested. \u201cAll of a sudden the ship captain in the Suez Canal \u2026 falls asleep, and then they block the Suez Canal for a week, and then you\u2019ve got to figure out how will this affect my enterprise, how does that cascade across my entire supply chain.\u201d With a graph model, that analysis is a cinch.\n Neo4j says that 800 enterprises are customers and 75% of the Fortune 100 are users of the company\u2019s products.\n We last checked in with the company in 2020 when it launched 4.0, which offered unlimited scaling. Today, Neo4j comes in a couple of different flavors. It\u2019s a database that can be either self-hosted or purchased as a cloud service offering which it dubs Aura. That\u2019s for the data storage folks. For the data scientists, the company offers Neo4j Graph Data Science Library, a set of comprehensive tools for analyzing graph data. The company offers free (or \u201ccommunity\u201d tiers), affordable starting tiers and full-scale enterprise pricing options depending on needs.\n  Development continues on the database. This morning at its developers conference, Neo4j demonstrated what it dubbed its \u201csuper-scaling technology\u201d on a 200 billion node graph with more than a trillion relationships between them, showing how its tools could offer \u201creal-time\u201d queries on such a large scale.\n Unsurprisingly, Eifrem said that the new venture funding will be used to continue doubling down on \u201cproduct, product, product\u201d but emphasized a few major strategic initiatives as critical for the company. First, he wants to continue to deepen the company\u2019s partnerships with public cloud providers. It already has a deep relationship with Google Cloud (GV was an investor in this round after all), and hopes to continue building relationships with other providers.\n It\u2019s also seeing a major uptick in interest from the APAC region. Eifrem said that the company recently opened up an office in Singapore to accelerate its sales in the broader IT market there.\n Overall, \u201cWe think that graphs can be a significant part of the modern data landscape. In fact, we believe it can be the  biggest part of the modern data landscape.

This rate then continues as they enter the following year. Google, more recently, took  a slightly different course, by lowering the commissions to 15% on the first $1 million of developer revenue earned through the Play billing system each year.\n Amazon\u2019s cut remains larger at 20%, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s offering developers a different type of perk: AWS credits.\n  The company says developers with less than $1 million in Appstore revenue in a calendar year will receive 10% of their revenue as promotional credit for AWS services. This includes infrastructure technologies like compute, storage, and databases\u2013to emerging technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, data lakes and analytics, and Internet of Things, notes Amazon. This brings total program benefits up to an equivalent of 90 percent of revenue, Amazon says.\n If the developer\u2019s revenue exceeds $1 million during the current year, they\u2019ll revert to the standard royalty rate and no longer receive the AWS credits for the rest of the year.\n And if the developer\u2019s revenue in a future year drops below $1 million, they\u2019ll become eligible for the Small Business program again in the next calendar year.\n \u201cBy helping small businesses get started with AWS through credits, we are making it easier for them to build and grow their app businesses,\u201d noted Amazon Appstore Director, Palanidaran Chidambaram, in an  announcement. \u201cAWS gives developers easy access to a broad range of technologies so they can innovate faster and build nearly anything they can imagine,\u201d he added.\n The changes to app store commission structures come at a time when tech giants are seeing increasing regulatory pressure over the nature of their businesses, which larger app publishers, including Basecamp, Spotify, Epic Games and others have  argued are anticompetitive. Epic is  also suing Apple over its app store fees, in a potentially precedent-setting case. In response, Apple and Google lowered fees for smaller businesses as a gesture of goodwill \u2014 and one that wouldn\u2019t significantly impact their own app store platform revenues.\n Amazon says the new program will launch in Q4 2021, and more details about how to participate will be provided at that time.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 00:28:51", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name":

and President Rich Schmidt made a series of statements Tuesday at an Automotive Press Association event that drove up shares in the company, including that it has enough \u201cbinding orders\u201d from customers to fund limited production of its electric pickup truck through May 2022. Those comments came just a day after an executive shakeup that included the  resignation of the company\u2019s CEO and CFO.\n It appears those \u201cbinding orders\u201d were more like agreements to maybe lease or buy,  according to a document Lordstown filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing has caused shares of Lordstown to fall more than 4%.\n   To clarify recent remarks by company executives at the Automotive Press Association online media event on June 15, although these vehicle purchase agreements provide us with a significant indicator of demand for the Endurance, these agreements do not represent binding purchase orders or other firm purchase commitments. As previously disclosed in our Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 8, 2021, to date, we have engaged in limited marketing activities and we have no binding purchase orders or commitments from customers.\n Lordstown notes in the SEC filing that an important aspect of its sales and marketing strategy involves pursuing relationships with specialty upfitting and fleet management companies. For instance, in March 2021 Lordstown announced an agreement with ARI, a fleet management affiliate of Holman Enterprises. Under the agreement, ARI \u201cwould use reasonable efforts to facilitate orders from its leasing clients for the Endurance over a three-year time period on the terms set forth in the agreement.\u201d\n Lordstown has also entered into vehicle purchase agreements with additional specialty upfitting and fleet management companies as a component of that strategy, the company explained. This might sound like a binding order, but it\u2019s not,\u00a0 as the following language in the SEC doc makes more clear.\n \u201cThese vehicle purchase agreements generally include a projected buyer order schedule over the 3- to 5-year life of the agreement, and may be terminated by either party at will on 30 days\u2019 notice,\u201d the filing from Lordstown reads. \u201cThey do not commit the counterparties to purchase vehicles, but we believe that they provide us with a significant indicator of demand for the Endurance.\u201d\n The reversal from Lordstown is just the latest in a string of issues at the newly public company. Lordstown Motors is an offshoot of the now former CEO Steve Burns\u2019 other company, Workhorse Group, a battery-electric transportation technology company that is also publicly traded. Workhorse holds a 10% stake in Lordstown Motors. Lordstown Motors went public after merging with special-purpose acquisition company DiamondPeak Holdings Corp.\n In March, Hindenburg Research, the short-seller firm whose report on Nikola Motor led to an SEC investigation and the resignation of its founder, said it had  taken a short position on Lordstown Motors, causing shares to plummet 21%. Hindenburg said at the time that its short position was based on a company has \u201cno revenue and no sellable product, which we believe has misled investors on both its demand and production capabilities.\u201d\n Hindenburg disputes that the company has booked 100,000 pre-orders for its electric pickup truck, a stat shared by Lordstown Motors in January. The short seller says that \u201cextensive research reveals that the company\u2019s orders appear largely fictitious and used as a prop to raise capital and confer legitimacy.\u201d The firm goes further and alleges that Lordstown founder and CEO Steve Burns paid consultants for every truck pre-order as early as 2016 while he was leading Workhorse.\n Two months later, Lordstown reported in its first-quarter earnings that production volumes of the Endurance would likely be half \u2014 from around 2,200 vehicles to just 1,000 \u2014 due to a lack of funding. The statements made by Lordstown execs Tuesday appeared to be an attempt, which backfired, to assuage investors.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 00:28:19", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "motors", "title": "Lordstown Motors\u9006\u8f6c\u7535\u52a8\u62fe\u53d6\u5361\u8f66\u5173\u4e8e\u201c\u88c5\u8ba2\u8ba2\u5355\u201d\u7684\u58f0\u660e ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tLordstown Motors reverses claims about \u201cbinding orders\u201d for electric pickup truck\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/lordstown-motors-reverses-claims-about-binding-orders-for-electric-pickup-truck/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["motors"]}]
