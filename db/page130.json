As it turns out, science may be proving her right \u2014 though perhaps not in exactly the way she thought.\n I am a researcher who specializes in understanding the links between diet, sleep and health. Up until around 2014, my lab focused on examining how too little sleep affects obesity. Our work showed that reducing sleep by about four hours per night, for four nights, led to an increase in eating, amounting to about\u00a0 300 calories per day\u00a0(the equivalent of one McDonald\u2019s cheeseburger). The cause, we found, is increased activity in the\u00a0 reward centers\u00a0of the brain specific to food, along with alterations in hormones that control\u00a0 feelings\u00a0of fullness. In other words, people who sleep less feel hungrier, and tend to crave foods that are high in sugar and fat.\n    Then, in 2014, the US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee \u2014 the group of scientists that makes recommendations about what Americans should eat to be healthy \u2014 reached out to me to ask the opposite question: How does diet affect sleep? This was an intriguing question.\n It\u2019s also a very important one. About\u00a0 35 percent of Americans get less than the\u00a0 recommended minimum of seven hours\u00a0of sleep per night;\u00a0 10 percent to 30 percent\u00a0suffer from a sleep disorder like insomnia or sleep apnea. Sleeping too little and sleep disorders have been associated with a host of problems ranging from psychological conditions to chronic diseases such as\u00a0 type 2 diabetes\u00a0and\u00a0 cardiovascular disease.\n But getting more and better sleep isn\u2019t always just a matter of going to bed earlier: It turns out that diet is an under-recognized contributor to good or bad sleep.\n Usually, people can pinpoint food or beverage triggers that contribute to bad sleep: Drinking coffee too late in the day or having a large meal too close to bedtime are two obvious ones that can interfere with sleep. What is less noticeable is how healthy choices made throughout the day can have a positive influence on slumber.\n Our studies over the past seven years have shown that eating more fiber and less saturated fat and sugar during the day results in\u00a0 deeper, less disturbed sleep at night. It may be particularly helpful to eat a Mediterranean-type diet rich in fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains and olive oil, and low in red and processed meat and whole-fat dairy. In\u00a0 our research, those who followed this diet were 1.4 times more likely to have good night\u2019s sleep and 35 percent less likely to have insomnia.\n Why? It\u2019s partly because protein-rich foods such as nuts and seeds, fish, poultry and eggs contain tryptophan, an amino acid from which the sleep-regulating hormone melatonin is produced in the brain. Other foods \u2014 including tomatoes, pineapple, tart cherries, bananas, apples, vegetable oils, nuts and animal products \u2014 contain melatonin itself. In plants, melatonin serves as an antioxidant to prevent damage, while in animals it serves to regulate their sleep (much as it does in humans). Eating such melatonin-rich foods may also boost your own melatonin levels, although research on this is sparse.\n  Our work suggests that the effects of diet on sleep can be as powerful, or maybe more powerful, than\u00a0 mindfulness\u00a0practices (increasing awareness and acceptance of one\u2019s thoughts and feelings, through meditation for example) or melatonin supplementation through pills. Studies show that melatonin supplements on average reduce the time to fall asleep by\u00a0 four minutes; in one of our studies, eating a healthy diet reduced time to fall asleep by about\u00a0 12 minutes, and the overall sleep quality was better.\n In the end, bad sleep and poor diet can be a vicious cycle: Lack of sleep leads to poor dietary choices, which in turn causes low quality sleep. But we can interrupt this cycle and turn it around. Eating well throughout the day could produce sounder, more restful sleep \u2014 which, in turn, could contribute to making better food choices.\n Interestingly, this may be easier to achieve for early birds. People who consider themselves night owls \u2014 feeling their best late in the day rather than early \u2014 tend, on average, to eat less\u00a0 plant protein, fruits and vegetables. This evening preference is also associated (again, on average) with\u00a0 greater rates of illness and earlier\u00a0death.\n           Thank you for your interest in republishing!

Mahogany trees drooping over sandy beaches.\n James Hastie, who was moving to Poyais with his wife and 2 children,  thought the country \u201chad a very beautiful appearance from the sea.\u201d\n Like many passengers, Hastie had signed a contract with the Poyaisian government to work as a laborer. Others, including doctors and lawyers, had cashed in their belongings in Europe for land in Poyais and the opportunity to establish themselves as a new upper crust in the Caribbean.\n Rich or poor, it seemed impossible not to prosper. The myriad Poyais advertisements that circulated through Britain had promised fertile land, rivers stocked with fish, and forests teeming with deer.\n But as Hastie and the others soon discovered, Poyais was not a country at all. It was one of the most elaborate \u2014 and deadliest \u2014 frauds in history.\n  Raised by a privileged Scottish family on the periphery of the aristocracy, Gregor MacGregor tasted enough wealth to know how good it would feel to have more.\n MacGregor went to top schools and, at 16, he joined the British army, a haven for status-seeking young men. But his real coup was winning the heart of Maria Bowater, a daughter of a navy admiral who ran in Britain\u2019s finest social circles.\n  A portrait of a young MacGregor in the British army (George Watson/National Gallery of Scotland/Wikipedia; 1804)\n Armed with Bowater\u2019s family wealth and prestige, military life suddenly got easier for MacGregor.\n   He paid  \u00a3900 (~\u00a372k today) to become captain of his regiment \u2014 a promotion that would have otherwise taken several years \u2014 and was on the fast track toward general, the highest distinction in the army.\n But the money didn\u2019t make MacGregor competent at his job. After a fight with a superior officer, he was forced to resign.\n Then, in 1811, Bowater died, and her embarrassed in-laws cut off MacGregor from their fortune. His supply of old money gone dry, MacGregor seemed destined for obscurity.\n  After spending several years as a hapless leader in Venezuela\u2019s revolution against Spain \u2014 which included deserting his troops during 2 key battles \u2014 MacGregor returned to England in 1821 with instant credibility because of his ties to the decorated politician  Francisco de Miranda.\n It also helped that he married rich  again, this time to a cousin of the famed revolutionary Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. The duo became a power couple, wined and dined by London\u2019s lord mayor.\n    In 1820, the brother of one of MacGregor\u2019s charges in Venezuela released a 418-page book that detailed MacGregor\u2019s military mishaps, more or less eviscerating him as a leader.\n \u201cThat any person could be induced again to join him in his desperate projects,\u201d wrote Michael Rafter, \u201cwould be to conceive a degree of madness and folly of which human nature, however fallen, is incapable.\u201d\n    Britain was swimming in cash and optimism after the end of the Napoleonic Wars. But there was no more war to finance, and the interest rates of the most popular British-backed securities declined, tempting the record numbers of people trying to time the market for maximum profit to find something stronger and riskier.\n South America \u2014 a catch-all for what is now Latin America \u2014 was the inevitable target.\n Several countries had gained independence from Spain and were floating bonds to finance their incipient governments. Countries like Colombia and Chile  sold bonds totaling  ~\u00a3100m-\u00a3200m in today\u2019s money, promising  6% in annual returns by tapping into profits from state-run agriculture and mineral industries.\n So began a craze akin to the dot-com bubble: Investors who knew basically nothing about the inner workings of South American countries went on a buying spree, inflating the value of the bonds and creating an intense resale market.\n    During his South American misadventures, he\u2019d befriended George Frederic August I \u2014 the king of the Mosquito Coast Territory (present-day Honduras and Nicaragua) \u2014 and had been gifted  8 million acres on the eastern shore of Honduras, an area roughly the size of Maryland.\n The land belonged to MacGregor, but it was under the dominion of the British-aligned Mosquito government. Of course, nobody in Europe knew these details.\n So back in London, at various society events, MacGregor presented his land as the independent country of  Poyais \u2014 and cast himself as the ruling \u201cCazique.\u201d\n  He designed a national flag and  a coat of arms for Poyais featuring two unicorns.\n He got British papers to detail  bond prices for Poyais just as they did for legitimate countries.\n Outside offices in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and London, he and his representatives handed out brochures and sang songs about Poyais.\n To top it off, there was  a book about Poyais that concluded the new country \u201cwould rapidly advance in prosperity and civilization.\u201d (This ruse perhaps should have been obvious \u2014 the pseudonymous author\u2019s name was \u201cThomas Strangeways.\u201d)\n  MacGregor advertised Poyaisian land and estates in papers throughout Scotland and England. (Via Newspapers.com/The Caledonian Mercury)\n As 1822 wore on, the excitement spread, and MacGregor steadily increased the price of land from 1 shilling per acre to 4 shillings per acre ( \u00a36 to \u00a324 per acre today). In the fall, investors snapped up  \u00a3200k of bonds ( ~\u00a324m today) at a 6% rate of return.\n They believed they were financing a building boom in a developing country. In reality, the money lined MacGregor\u2019s pockets.\n There was just one major concern, according to David Sinclair\u2019s book   The Land That Never Was: How would Poyais pay the interest?\n Without any current revenues to describe, MacGregor assured the investors that funding would come from future inhabitants.\n  Fortunately for MacGregor, hundreds of British had fallen for the marketing hype, exchanging their life savings for Poyaisian money and  land grants. The first ~70 settlers left from England in fall 1822 on the  Honduras Packet. Another ~180 set sail from Scotland in January 1823 on the  Kennersley Castle.\n Before the 2nd group departed, MacGregor greeted them aboard the  Kennersley Castle and offered free passage for all the women and children. The future Poyais residents were elated at his generosity.\n \u201cWe gave him a salute of 6 guns and 3 cheers,\u201d Hastie  recalled in his memoir. \u201cLittle did we anticipate the misfortunes which were afterwards to befall us.\u201d\n  After the beautiful view from the ship, Hastie and the others believed they would find St. Joseph, a European-style capital city outfitted with a government center and a theater.\n Strangely, the new arrivals didn\u2019t see any dwellings or buildings. The only signs of life were the remaining passengers from the  Honduras Packet, holed up in bamboo huts, and 2 eccentric Americans who had been living off the land for years.\n There was no property to be assigned to the landowners. No banks for depositing and withdrawing Poyaisian money. No easy access to wild game.\n   Over the next couple months, the Poyais newcomers felt the consequences of the punishing heat and humidity, withering away from hunger, exhaustion, and malaria as they rationed provisions from the ship.\n One leader swindled by MacGregor, Hector Hall, and a Belizean general organized trips between Poyais and Belize, rescuing ~100 people whose health hadn\u2019t completely deteriorated.\n They also sent word to Britain that Poyais was a scam, leading the Royal Navy to intercept 5 more ships headed toward Poyais.\n In October 1823, ~50 of the Poyais settlers arrived in Britain, including Hastie and his wife. Hastie\u2019s 2 children did not survive, and fewer than \u2153 of the settlers who had arrived in Poyais in the previous year made it back alive. Those who did were in critical condition.\n \u201cThey had evidently undergone extreme suffering and illness, as their appearance was ghastly and cadaverous,\u201d  wrote one Scottish newspaper.\n MacGregor\u2019s scheme \u2014 and the entire British economy \u2014 were on the verge of collapse.\n   One guest  remembered being asked at a party to take an oath to Poyais, only to find it impossible to recite the words in their drunken stupor, \u201cfrom\u2026 the wine having passed very freely round.\u201d\n  South American bonds  faltered in the middle of his Poyais scheme because the countries that sold their bonds spent the proceeds on military conflicts, failing to pay back their debts. Many investors grew skeptical of Poyais by association \u2014 even before knowing it was fake \u2014 and declined to pay the new installments they owed for their bond purchases.\n  Top: A fictional illustration of Poyais (Chronicle Books); Bottom: A one-dollar note issued by the Bank of Poyais, Republic of Poyais (WIkipedia)\n MacGregor had spent enormous sums on marketing, on voyages to the fake country, and on his own extravagant lifestyle. When the bond payments ended, his cash flow trickled to nothing.\n The Poyais fraud was extraordinary because of the suffering and death it inflicted upon more than  200 would-be settlers. But the financial repercussions were hardly unique.\n The South American bond bubble popped, contributing to the Financial Panic of 1825. By 1827, nearly every Central and South American bond issue  had gone into default. In the aftermath of the panic,  52 English banks  failed.\n As with bubbles and scams today, it was the average British person who  fared the worst.\n Wealthy insiders got in on South American bonds at the earliest stages and lowest prices. Regular investors paid the higher prices, only to sell them for a fraction when the bonds didn\u2019t pay out.\n The few people who held onto their bonds made some money back when South American countries stabilized and started making interest payments in the 1840s and 1850s. Of course, if they invested in Poyais they never saw a dime.\n It\u2019s likely at least  ~\u00a33.6m in today\u2019s money was lost because the down payment owed on the \u00a324m of bonds sold was 15%, according to Sinclair\u2019s book.\n MacGregor also sold  ~500 grants of land (for amounts such as  100 acres and 1k acres) and bilked investors and settlers out of untold amounts of British pounds exchanged for fake Poyais currency.\n   Knowing more trouble lay ahead as his victims returned, MacGregor fled to France. He escaped prosecution for his fraud and tried selling land in Poyais twice more before retiring to Venezuela.\n And a peculiar thing happened when the Poyais survivors got back to Britain.

Particularly in the Japanese business world, one outdated, simple item known as a hanko stamp is the key when it comes to conducting business and signing papers. So what exactly is a Japanese hanko stamp, and why is it so important?\n  Hanko, also known as  inkan, are stamps that can be used anytime someone needs to use a signature or initial something. Hanko are used for both individuals or for people acting on behalf of a business. A hanko is one\u2019s personal seal and they are used as a \u201csignature\u201d in many different situations, from serious matters such as banking to a more casual instance of receiving a package.\n While the idea of a personal seal is cool, many people find it a bit annoying to require a stamp when a signature would accomplish the same task. Especially if you run into a situation where you\u2019ve forgotten yours at home and they can\u2019t just use your signature. In 2020, the Japanese government, in its attempts to modernize its very old school business world, decided to phase out the use hanko. This phase out may take some time or may never actually even happen, so for now, hanko are still very much a thing.\n  Jitsuin  ( \u5b9f\u5370 ) \u2013 This is a person\u2019s officially registered seal that has to be registered at a town hall. It comes with an inkan card, which allows you to print certificates of registration (for a small fee). The certificates are normally needed to prove the seal is registered to you and not someone else. This seal may be required when buying a home, car, or other big and expensive items. Also things like setting up a company or taking out a loan require a  jitsuin.\n Ginkoin  ( \u9280\u884c\u5370 ) \u2013 \u201cGinko\u201d meaning bank and \u201cin\u201d meaning seal. A  ginkoin is used exclusively at the bank. This means instead of registering the hanko stamp with the city hall, it will need to be registered at the bank. If you need to do something at the bank, make sure you have your  ginkoin with you.\n Mitomein ( \u8a8d\u3081\u5370) \u2013 Mitome means \u201capproval\u201d and this seal is for personal use. A  mitomein isn\u2019t registered anywhere and therefore isn\u2019t legal binding in the same way as a  jitsuin. This makes it more useful for things like signing for a package. Things that require a  jitsuin will ask for a certificate or registration, which is why  jitsuin are legal binding and  mitomein aren\u2019t.\n Technically you can just use one hanko stamp for all of these different situations. However, it may not be wise to do so because your  jitsuin is basically a signature and it can be copied fairly easily. So the less you use it, especially for things where a  mitomein would suffice, the less likely it is to be copied.\n  Probably not, but many people do just in case. It depends on what you do and whether you sign many contracts. Even then, if you\u2019re foreigner, you can probably just sign your name in most circumstances. If there is a contract that requires a hanko, then it only takes a couple days to get a new hanko and to register it.\n  There are many hankoya (hanko shops) that specialize in making and selling hanko. You can order online at shops like  hankoya.com. There are also in-person stores like \u201cHankoyasan 21\u201d, which is a common hankoya chain in Japan. Since hanko is a specifically Japanese thing, the online shops won\u2019t have any English, so make sure you can read Japanese or at least be ready to Google translate.\n If you just want a hanko as a souvenir you could buy from one of the online or specialty shops above; however if you want to save a little money, there are cheaper options. Generic hanko for much cheaper can be found at 100 yen stores like Daiso. These will have common Japanese names or words rather than custom seals. And, because they are generic, they aren\u2019t allowed to be used as a  jitsuin or  ginkoin. If you\u2019re looking for a cheap but usable hanko, then shops like Donquiote have machines that sell customizable hanko for around 500 yen.\n  There are a few rules for what you can use for your seal. The most important rule is that it has to contain part of your name. It is supposed to be your whole name, but for foreign names they might not fit, so you can do either your whole, just your first, or just your last name. Also, the characters used must be actually part of your name, so using English letters or even the katakana version of your name is fine. However, you can\u2019t use kanji with similar readings/sounds for your name. If you do choose katakana, then it\u2019s important to make sure you have that katakana named registered somewhere\u00a0on something like a residence card. Otherwise your hanko might be rejected when you try to register it since it wouldn\u2019t technically be your official name.\n  While it is a bit of a hassle, it\u2019s not the end of the world if you happen to lose your hanko. In the case of losing your  ginkoin, you\u2019ll need to contact your bank and let them know. They will have you cancel/invalidate the registration for your lost hanko and you\u2019ll then need to register a new seal with them.\n It\u2019s a similar process if you lose your  jitsuin; however, you must contact the local government office where you originally registered it. They\u2019ll then have you sign some paperwork to cancel your lost hanko and you can get a new one to register. Also, it\u2019s a good idea to contact the police if you lose your hanko. Both to make them aware in case someone tries to use it and also because someone may turn it in to police and you could possibly recover it.\n         Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n Daisekirinzan (\u5927\u77f3\u6797\u5c71) contains many oddly shaped rocks, a beautiful forest with bayan trees, and is situated on the mountain of Ashimui.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 07:41:19", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u65e5\u672c,hanko,\u6c49\u8bfa", "title": "\u65e5\u672c\u6c49\u8bfa\u90ae\u7968\uff1a\u65e5\u672c\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u5bc6\u5c01\u6307\u5357", "title_en": "Japanese Hanko Stamp: Guide to Japan\u2019s Personal Seals", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.japancentric.com/japanese-hanko-stamp-guide-to-japans-personal-seals/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u65e5\u672c", "hanko", "\u6c49\u8bfa"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e2869500c7a171afcb175582b22df82b.jpg", "infoid": 1072570, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "2017\u5e742\u6708\uff0c\u5723\u5730\u4e9a\u54e5\u81ea\u7136\u5386\u53f2\u535a\u7269\u9986\u6536\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u53e5\u8bdd\uff0c\u5458\u5de5\u53e4\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5bb6\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u540c\u4e8b\u4eec\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u671f\u520a\u5927\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u51fa\u7248\u4e2d\u88ab\u63a5\u53d7\u4e86\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u793a\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8ff9\u8c61\u7684\u4e73\u623f\u5316\u77f3\u7684\u9ea6\u514b\u98ce\u5316\u77f3\u7684\u7a3f\u4ef6\u3002\n\u201c\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u6000\u7591\u662f\u826f\u597d\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u51fa\u7248\u7269\u662f\u79d1\u5b66\u8fa9\u8bba\u7684\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u6211\u6b22\u8fce\u548c\u9f13\u52b1\uff0c\u201d\u5fb7\u6885\u5c14\u65af\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u6ca1\u60f3\u5230\u7684\u662f\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u7684\u4e0d\u613f\u610f\u4ece\u4e8b\u53cc\u5411\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u5ba2\u89c2\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u201d\n\u6362\u53e5\u8bdd\u8bf4\uff0c\u575a\u6301\u4ed6\u4eec\u72ec\u81ea\u4e86\u89e3\u6709\u54ea\u4e9b\u8bc1\u636e\u5c31\u8db3\u591f\u4e86\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6839\u636eCerutti Mastodon\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5e94\u8be5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u662f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "note_en": "In February 2017, the San Diego Natural History Museum received word that a manuscript written by staff paleontologists and outside colleagues about the discovery of mastodon fossils showing signs of human activity had been accepted for publication in the scientific journal  Nature.\n  The 130,000-year-old fossil remains were discovered in November 1992 and excavated over the next 5 months by Museum paleontologists at a freeway expansion project site in San Diego (learn more about the discovery  here). The discovery (named the Cerutti Mastodon site after Richard Cerutti who found it) consisted of sharply broken mastodon fossils found alongside 5 large stones that appeared to have been used as hammers and anvils. Research into the site occurred over several decades from 1993 to 2017 and involved a multi-disciplinary team of respected scientists from the US and Australia.\n  If interpreted correctly, the Cerutti Mastodon site becomes the oldest archaeological site in the Americas, pushing back the record of early humans on this continent by more than 100,000 years. Folks knew it was a bold claim, one that would be received with extreme skepticism by many.\n  \u201cAs scientists, we seek explanations that best fit rigorous evidence, even if they conflict with previous thinking,\u201d said Dr. Tom Dem\u00e9r\u00e9, curator of paleontology at the Museum and one of the study\u2019s authors.\n  As expected, the April 26 announcement\u2014which coincided with the date the paper was published in  Nature\u2014garnered widespread media coverage and stirred dialog within the scientific community. A selection of some of this week-of coverage is included below. In addition there have been several more formal critiques of the published study that appeared several months later in scientific outlets. A selection of these are also listed below, along with the responses by the original authors. Some have been supportive and consider the hypothesis compelling and one that should not be ruled out. Others have dismissed it as questionable science or outlined why various interpretations of evidence are wrong.\n    \u201cI was a strong critic when I first looked at the evidence and said \u2018I can\u2019t believe this is really here,\u2019 but it is and it\u2019s shocking,\u201d said archeologist and lead author Dr. Steve Holen, referring to the moment in 2008 when he first examined the Cerutti Mastodon site specimens. As the April 2017 publication date approached, Dr. Holen added, \u201cWe\u2019re expecting pushback and expect people to be critical, we want people to be critical.\u201d\n  While acknowledging that it takes a huge amount of evidence to overturn current thinking, the authors of the paper also hoped there would be more openness and discussion.\n  \u201cHealthy skepticism is the foundation of good science, and the publication of this discovery is the beginning of a scientific debate, which I welcome and encourage,\u201d said Dem\u00e9r\u00e9. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t expect was the reluctance of scientists to engage in a two-way conversation to objectively evaluate our hypothesis.\u201d\n  More recent articles, published online in scientific journals like  Paleo America and  Nature, consist of critiques by archaeologists who claim the Cerutti Mastodon evidence is not enough. These articles were published alongside responses from the manuscript\u2019s original authors. One article in  Paleo America is supportive of the hypothesis. These articles are generating additional discourse and media attention.\n  According to Dem\u00e9r\u00e9, all of the published comments utilize evaluations from afar without actual examination of the specimens or discussions with the team of researchers who worked on the discovery for decades. \u201cWe hoped that the publication of our findings would spur more meaningful, evidence-based conversations. So far, the academic debate has not been based on direct observation, but rather on long-distance interpretations of our data,\u201d he said.\n  Moreover, the alternative hypotheses that have been presented\u2014ranging from fluvial/flood processes, trampling by other large mammals, sediment compaction and weight, or damage from construction equipment\u2014simply do not account for all evidence presented.\n  \u201cBy ignoring the most important bone and stone evidence, the commenters have discarded from their analyses precisely those features that are individually and collectively least likely to have been caused by non-cultural processes,\u201d said Dem\u00e9r\u00e9.\n  Another approach in these published reactions is invoking the issue of equifinality\u2014in which multiple possible scenarios may be responsible for producing a given outcome. In the case of the Cerutti Mastodon site, the issue of equifinality has been raised to emphasize that it is one thing to show that broken bones and modified rocks could have been produced by people, but it is quite another to show that people, and people alone, could have produced those modifications.\n  \u201cThe commenters are demanding unequivocal proof of human agency,\u201d explained Dr. Dan Fisher, professor of paleontology at the University of Michigan and one of the authors on the original paper. \u201cThis is an unreasonable requirement\u2014having to define  a priori what evidence must be present at a site to qualify as acceptable grounds for inferring human presence is largely a construct of a certain faction of the archaeological community.\u201d\n  In other words, insisting that they alone know what evidence is sufficient and on what grounds we should base our arguments is largely the problem, according to the Cerutti Mastodon team.\n  \u201cNo site is perfect, but by being aware of what evidence we have to work with and what we don\u2019t, we can still develop robust and parsimonious explanations of causation,\u201d Fisher continued. \u201cDemanding proof beyond any doubt\u2014rather than beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014is an unrealistic standard.\u201d\n  For example, it would have been ideal if human remains or even flaked stones tools were found at the Cerutti Mastodon site, but none were. However, a majority of archaeological sites lack human remains, and the absence of flaked stone tools at a site does not necessarily mean an absence of humans. In proposing that the Cerutti Mastodon site was a bone processing site\u2014not a meat butchering site or a campsite\u2014the authors suggest that only expedient tools in the form of cobble hammers and anvils were required to break bones and molars into smaller pieces that could be as raw material for other needs, or to harvest marrow.\n  Dem\u00e9r\u00e9 admits that, \u201cOne site does not a new paradigm make.\u201d But he adds, \u201cWe think the evidence from the Cerutti Mastodon site is really compelling, and we encourage the scientific community to reconsider the current paradigm and to attempt to replicate this find by looking in places that may have previously been written off simply because they were thought to be too old.\u201d\n      Humans in California 130,000 Years Ago?

But it\u2019s due to become science fact later this year when a radiation-hardened console rides along in NASA\u2019s  Orion deep-space capsule for the  Artemis 1 round-the-moon mission.\n There\u2019ll be no humans aboard for the test flight, which will mark the first launch of NASA\u2019s heavy-lift  Space Launch System rocket. Instead, Alexa\u2019s voice, and Echo\u2019s pulsing blue ring, will be interacting with operators at Houston\u2019s Mission Control for a technology demonstration created by Lockheed Martin, Amazon and Cisco.\n  The project is known as Callisto \u2014 a name that pays tribute to the  mythological nymph who was a follower of the Greek goddess Artemis.\n \u201cCallisto will demonstrate a first-of-its-kind technology that could be used in the future to enable astronauts to be more self-reliant as they explore deep space,\u201d Lisa Callahan, Lockheed Martin\u2019s vice president and general manager of commercial civil space,  said today in a news release.\n Including Alexa on the mission is particularly meaningful for Aaron Rubenson, vice president of Amazon Alexa. \u201cThe Star Trek computer was actually a key part of the original inspiration for Alexa \u2014 this notion of an ambient intelligence that is there when you need it \u2026 but then also fades into the background when you don\u2019t need it,\u201d he said during a teleconference.\n A little more than seven years after  Alexa made its debut, it\u2019s finally getting off this rock. \u201cWe envision a future where astronauts could turn to an onboard AI for access to information, for assistance in doing their job, making their job simpler and more efficient, and ultimately for some form of companionship,\u201d Rubenson said.\n   With guidance from Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor for the Orion spacecraft, Amazon tweaked the Echo hardware to be more resilient to radiation in the space environment, and tweaked the Alexa software to be more attuned to voice commands in a capsule that can get noisier than your typical living room.\n Callisto also has a tablet-based version of Cisco\u2019s  Webex videoconferencing system built in, with a whiteboarding feature that could come in handy for collaboration between Orion\u2019s future crews and ground controllers.\n The in-space version of Alexa takes advantage of the platform\u2019s ability to support voice interactions even if the spacecraft is out of communication with the ground. Local voice control means crews in lunar orbit won\u2019t always have to deal with the seconds-long communication gaps that Apollo astronauts experienced.\n \u201cThese are the all the sorts of challenges that we\u2019ve been working through to make this demonstration possible,\u201d Rubenson said. \u201cFrom a capability standpoint, we\u2019ve also added thousands of new interactions that Alexa can process that are relevant to space and to the mission.\u201d\n  Artemis 1 is due for launch from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida in the March-April time frame, with Callisto installed at the front of the Orion crew cabin.\n The team recently conducted an end-to-end communications test to work out the bugs. \u201cWe had a couple of hiccups, but then we corrected those, and it was great,\u201d said Rob Chambers, Lockheed Martin Space Systems\u2019 director of human spaceflight strategy and business development.\n  A team of virtual astronauts at Mission Control will put Callisto through its paces over the course of the weeks-long mission, which is due to range beyond lunar orbit. The tests will include streaming 720p HD video, sharing a whiteboard, getting readings on spacecraft telemetry and controlling the cabin lights.\n \u201cWe could imagine in the future potentially extending that to other types of devices,\u201d Rubenson said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s controlling camera views, or controlling the configurations of the screens. \u2026 For this first demonstration, we\u2019ve just focused on the lights as a proof of concept, and then one additional capability that we built.\u201d\n Rubenson said the in-space version of Alexa will be capable of checking its earthly data banks for the latest news or sports scores. \u201cWe think this feature is very important, because if we are trying to help astronauts combat the isolation that\u2019s part of a multiweek mission like this, being able to bring some of the daily routine into the spacecraft could be valuable,\u201d he said.\n Jeetu Patel, Cisco\u2019s executive vice president and general manager of security and collaboration, said Callisto had to satisfy NASA\u2019s standards for security and reliability. The last thing you\u2019d want is for Alexa to drop out at a critical moment, or to be held hostage by hackers.\n \u201cMaking sure there\u2019s a level of adherence to security and privacy, while ensuring that there\u2019s reliability on the connectivity side in space, is a non-trivial task,\u201d Patel said.\n Chambers said Lockheed Martin came up with the idea behind Callisto years ago and suggested it to NASA. \u201cAs you know, we\u2019ve built a few aircraft in our day, and no aircraft comes off the line these days without voice,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that we built spacecraft without voice, we thought, was kind of weird.\u201d\n NASA gave the go-ahead for the project, and Lockheed Martin hooked up with Amazon and Cisco to turn the idea into reality. The three companies are splitting the cost of development and compensating NASA for the space agency\u2019s costs. No taxpayer funds are involved, Chambers said.\n  For now, there\u2019s no commitment from NASA to include Callisto on the crewed flights it\u2019s planning \u2014 such as the  Artemis 2 round-the-moon mission that\u2019s scheduled for 2024, or the Artemis 3 moon landing that\u2019s  set for no earlier than 2025. But all three companies hope that Callisto will find its way aboard future spacecraft.\n \u201cWe\u2019re really looking to demonstrate something that would be of value to NASA and other space agencies, certainly all the commercial space players,\u201d Chambers said.\n Rubenson said the lessons learned in space should help Amazon improve Alexa\u2019s ability to perform earthly tasks as well.\n \u201cIf you think about some of the hardening we\u2019ve had to do around vibration, and the ability to handle queries without connectivity, those are relevant for the work we do, for example, in  Alexa-enabled cars,\u201d he said.\n Callisto could provide a teachable moment for the next generation of scientists, engineers and explorers: Amazon, for instance, is making more information about the Artemis 1 mission accessible via Alexa-enabled devices. The company is also rolling out a new Amazon Future Engineer program called  Alexa for Astronauts, which will offer live virtual tours from NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center as well as curriculum materials keyed to Artemis 1.\n To get a preview of Alexa\u2019s Artemis offerings, and to set up reminders for upcoming mission milestones, users can say, \u201cAlexa, take me to the moon.\u201d But whatever you do, don\u2019t ask Alexa to  open the pod bay doors.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 06:53:10", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b87\u822a\u5c40,amazon,\u7f8e\u56fd,\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a,nasa", "title": "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u52a0\u5165\u6d1b\u514b\u5e0c\u5fb7\u9a6c\u4e01\u548c\u601d\u79d1\u5c06Alexa\u9001\u5230\u592a\u7a7a\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b87\u822a\u5c40\u63d0\u4f9bNASA\u65c5\u6e38", "title_en": "Amazon Joins Lockheed Martin and Cisco to Send Alexa to Space, Offers NASA Tours for SchoolKids", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.geekwire.com/2022/amazon-teams-up-with-lockheed-martin-and-cisco-to-put-alexa-voice-assistant-on-nasas-moon-ship/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b87\u822a\u5c40", "amazon", "\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a", "nasa"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "207329704eb8d1e83e40e0233abe113d.jpg", "infoid": 1072568, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6709\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u635f\u574f\u4e86Github\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6ce8\u518c\u8868NPM\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u5f00\u6e90\u5e93 - \u201cfaker.js\u201d\u548c\u201ccolors.js\u201d - \u5343\u4e07\u7528\u6237\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\uff0c\u6e32\u67d3\u5305\u542b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e93\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u9879\u76ee\u65e0\u7528\u7684\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5982\u901a\u8fc7Blepeing Computer\u62a5\u9053\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5b83\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cfColor.js\u5df2\u66f4\u65b0\u4e3a\u5de5\u4f5c\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u6ce1\u6cab\u5a01\u65af\u7279\u4ecd\u7136\u4f3c\u4e4e\u53d7\u5230\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u524d\u7248\u672c\uff085.5.3\uff09\u4e0b\u8c03\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\u63a8\u52a8\u4f2a\u88c5\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u4e24\u5929\uff0c\u4ee5\u540e\u8ffd\u6c42\u63a8\u6587\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e0a\u50a8\u5b58\u4e86\u6570\u767e\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u5df2\u88ab\u6682\u505c\u5230Github\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u4f2a\u88c5\u6210\u548c\u989c\u8272\u548c\u989c\u8272\u4e2d\u7684\u53d8\u66f4\u5224\u65ad\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5b83\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u4ed6\u7684\u60ac\u67b6\u5df2\u7ecf\u88ab\u89e3\u9664\u4e86\u3002\u738b\u56fd\u4e8e1\u67084\u65e5\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u717d\u52a8\u8005\u3002\u57281\u67086\u65e5\u88ab\u7981\u6b62\uff0c\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u4ecb\u7ecd\u201c\u81ea\u7531\u201d\u7684\u989c\u8272\u7248\u672c.JS\u76f4\u52301\u67087\u65e5\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u8fd8\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u666e\u901a\u7684\u5e10\u6237\u662f\u5426\u88ab\u7981\u6b62\u4e86\u3002\u6fd2\u4e34\u8fbe\u5230Github\uff0c\u8bf7\u6c42\u8bc4\u8bba\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u7acb\u5373\u542c\u5230\u3002", "note_en": "A developer appears to have purposefully corrupted a pair of open-source libraries on GitHub and software registry npm \u2014 \u201c faker.js\u201d and \u201c colors.js\u201d \u2014 that thousands of users depend on, rendering any project that contains these libraries useless, as reported by   Bleeping Computer. While it looks like color.js has been updated to a working version, faker.js still appears to be affected, but the issue can be worked around by downgrading to a previous version (5.5.3).\n  Bleeping Computer found that the developer of these two libraries, Marak Squires, introduced a malignant commit (a file revision on GitHub) to colors.js that adds \u201c a new American flag module,\u201d as well as rolled out  version 6.6.6 of faker.js, triggering the same destructive turn of events. The sabotaged versions cause applications to infinitely output strange letters and symbols, beginning with three lines of text that read \u201cLIBERTY LIBERTY LIBERTY.\u201d\n Even more curiously, the faker.js Readme file has also been changed to \u201cWhat really happened with Aaron Swartz?\u201d  Swartz was a prominent developer who helped establish Creative Commons, RSS, and Reddit. In 2011, Swartz was charged for stealing documents from the academic database JSTOR with the purpose of making them free to access, and later committed suicide in 2013. Squires\u2019 mention of Swartz could potentially refer to conspiracy theories surrounding his death.\n As pointed out by  Bleeping Computer, a  number  of  users \u2014 including some working with Amazon\u2019s Cloud Development Kit \u2014 turned to GitHub\u2019s bug tracking system to voice their concerns about the issue. And since  faker.js sees nearly 2.5 million weekly downloads on npm, and  color.js gets about 22.4 million downloads per week, the effects of the corruption are likely far-reaching. For context, faker.js generates fake data for demos, color.js adds colors to javascript consoles.\n In response to the problem,  Squires posted an update on GitHub to address the \u201czalgo issue,\u201d which refers to the glitchy text that the corrupt files produce. \u201cIt\u2019s come to our attention that there is a zalgo bug in the v1.4.44-liberty-2 release of colors,\u201d Squires writes in a presumably sarcastic way. \u201cPlease know we are working right now to fix the situation and will have a resolution shortly.\u201d\n NPM has reverted to a previous version of the faker.js package and Github has suspended my access to all public and private projects. I have 100s of projects.  #AaronSwartz  pic.twitter.com/zFddwn631S\n\u2014 marak (@marak)  January 6, 2022\n Two days after pushing the corrupt update to faker.js, Squires later sent out a tweet noting he\u2019s been suspended from GitHub, despite storing hundreds of projects on the site. Judging by the changelog on both faker.js and colors.js, however, it looks like his suspension has already been lifted. Squires introduced the faker.js commit on January 4th, got banned on January 6th, and didn\u2019t introduce the \u201cliberty\u201d version of colors.js until January 7th. It\u2019s unclear whether Squires\u2019 account has been banned again.  The Verge reached out to GitHub with a request for comment but didn\u2019t immediately hear back.\n The story doesn\u2019t end there, though.

Some of the most impactful work was around GOGC optimization. In this blog we want to share our experience with a highly effective, low-risk, large-scale, semi-automated Go GC tuning mechanism.\n Uber\u2019s tech stack is composed of thousands of microservices, backed by a cloud-native, scheduler-based infrastructure. Most of these services are written in Go. Our team, Maps Production Engineering, has previously played an instrumental role in significantly improving the efficiency of multiple Java services by tuning GC. At the beginning of 2021, we explored the possibilities of having a similar impact on Go-based services. We ran several CPU profiles to assess the current state of affairs and we found that GC was the top CPU consumer for a vast majority of mission-critical services. Here is a representation of some CPU profiles where GC (identified by the  runtime.scanobject method) is consuming a significant portion of allocated compute resources.\n        Emboldened by this finding, we commenced to tune GC for the relevant services. To our delight, Go\u2019s GC implementation and the simplicity of tuning allowed us to automate the bulk of the detection and tuning mechanism. We detail our approach and its impact in the following sections.\n   Go runtime invokes a concurrent garbage collector at periodic intervals unless there is a triggering event before it. The triggering events are based on memory back pressure. Due to this, GC-impacted Go services benefit from more memory, since it reduces the times GC has to run. In addition, we realized that our host-level CPU to memory ratio is 1:5 (1 core : 5 GB RAM), while most Golang services were configured with a 1:1 to 1:2 ratio. Therefore, we were confident that we could leverage using more memory to reduce GC CPU impact. This is a service-agnostic mechanism that can yield a large impact when applied judiciously.\n Delving deep into Go\u2019s garbage collection is beyond the scope of this article, but here are the relevant bits for this work: Garbage collection in Go is concurrent and involves analyzing all objects to identify which ones are still reachable. We would call the reachable objects the \u201clive dataset.\u201d Go offers only one knob,   GOGC,  expressed in percentage of live dataset, to control garbage collection. The   GOGC  value acts as a multiplier for the dataset. The default value of   GOGC  is 100%, which means Go runtime will reserve the same amount of memory for new allocations as the live dataset. For instance:\n  Then the   pacer  is in charge of predicting when it is the best time to trigger GC to avoid hitting the hard target (soft target).\n     We identified that a fixed GOGC value-based tuning is not suitable for services at Uber. Some of the challenges are:\n It is not aware of the maximum memory assigned to the container and can cause out of memory issues.\n Our microservices have a significantly diverse memory utilization portfolio. For example, a sharded system can have very different live datasets. We experienced this in one of our services where the p99 utilization was 1G but the p1 was 100MB, therefore the 100MB instances were having a huge GC impact.\n   The pain points previously presented are the reason for the conception of GOGCTuner. GOGCTuner is a library which simplifies the process of tuning garbage collection for service owners and adds a reliability layer on top of it.\n GOGCTuner dynamically computes the correct GOGC value in accordance with the container\u2019s memory limit (or the upper limit from the service owner) and sets it using Go\u2019s runtime API. Following are the specifics of the GOGCTuner library\u2019s features:\n Simplified configuration for easier reasoning and deterministic calculations. GOGC at 100% is not clear for beginner Go developers and it is not deterministic, because it still depends on the live dataset. On the other hand a 70% limit ensures that the service is always going to use 70% of the heap space.\n Protection against OOMs (Out Of Memory): The library reads the memory limit from the cgroup and uses a default hard limit of 70%, a safe value from our experience. It is important to note that there is a limit to this protection. The tuner can only adjust the buffer allocation, so if your service live objects are higher than the limit the tuner would set a default lower limit of 1.25X your live objects utilization.\n Allow higher GOGC values for corner cases like: As we mentioned above, manual GOGC is not deterministic. We are still relying on the size of the live dataset. What if live_dataset doubles our last peak value? GOGCTuner would enforce the same memory limit at the cost of more CPU. Manual tuning instead could cause OOMs. Therefore, service owners used to give plenty of buffer for these types of scenarios. See the example below:\n           Services using   MADV_FREE  memory policy that results in wrong memory metrics. For instance, our observability metrics were showing 50% memory utilization (when it actually had already released 20% of that 50%). Then service owners were only tuning GOGC using this \u201cinaccurate\u201d metric.\n   We found that we lacked some critical metrics which would give us more insights into garbage collection of each service.\n Intervals between garbage collections : useful to know if we can still tune. For instance, Go forces a garbage collection every 2 minutes. If your service is still having high GC impact, but you already see 120s for this graph, it means that you can no longer tune using GOGC. In this case you would need to optimize your allocations.\n    GC CPU impact : allows us to know which services are the most affected by GC.\n    Live dataset size : helps us to identify memory leaks. The concern noted by service owners was that they saw an increase in memory utilization. In order to show them there was no memory leak we added the \u201clive usage\u201d metric, which showed a steady utilization.\n          Our initial approach was to have a ticker to run every second to monitor the heap metrics, and then adjust GOGC value accordingly. The disadvantage of this approach is that the overhead starts to become considerable, because in order to read heap metrics Go needs to do a STW (  ReadMemStats ) and it is somewhat inaccurate, because we can have more than one garbage collection per second.\n Luckily we were able to find a good alternative. Go has finalizers (  SetFinalizer ), which are functions that run when the object is going to be garbage collected. They are mainly useful for cleaning memory in C code or some other resources. We were able to employ a self-referencing finalizer that resets itself on every GC invocation. This allows us to reduce any CPU overhead. For instance:\n   Calling   runtime . SetFinalizer ( f ,  finalizerHandler )  inside of  finalizerHandler  is what allows the handler to run on every GC; it is basically not letting the reference die, since it is not a costly resource to keep alive (it is just a pointer).\n   After deploying GOGCTuner across a few dozen of our services, we dove deep on a few that showed significant, double-digit improvement in their CPU utilization. Accumulated cost savings from these services alone are around 70K cores. Following are 2 such examples:\n       The resulting CPU utilization reduction improves p99 latency (and associated SLA, user experience) tactically, and cost of capacity strategically (since services are scaled based on their utilization).\n   Garbage collection is one of the most elusive and underestimated performance influencers of an application. Go\u2019s robust GC mechanism and simplified tuning, our diverse, large-scale Go services footprint, and a robust internal platform (Go, compute, observability) collectively allowed us to make such a large-scale impact. We expect to continue improving how we tune GC as the problem space itself is evolving, due to changes in the tech and our competency.\n To reiterate what we mentioned at the introduction: there is no one size fits all solution. We feel GC performance will remain variable in cloud-native setup due to the highly variable performance of both public clouds and containerized workloads that run within. Coupled with the fact that a vast majority of CNCF landscape projects that we use are written in Golang (Kubernetes, Prometheus, Jaeger, etc.), this means any large-scale deployment outside could also benefit from such effort.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 06:37:15", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u534a\u81ea\u52a8,semi,\u5185\u5b58", "title": "\u6211\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u534a\u81ea\u52a8GO GC\u8c03\u6574\u4fdd\u5b5870K\u5185\u6838", "title_en": "How We Saved 70K Cores with Semi-Automated Go GC Tuning", "transed": 1, "url": "https://eng.uber.com/how-we-saved-70k-cores-across-30-mission-critical-services/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u534a\u81ea\u52a8", "semi", "\u5185\u5b58"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "6003c74de391823d5141a450b25fecf9.jpg", "infoid": 1072564, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u7684\u6089\u5c3c\u897f\u5317\u6570\u767e\u82f1\u91cc\u7684\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u4e2d\u592e\u5927\u6559\u5802\uff0c\u4eca\u5929\u7531\u8349\u548c\u7ea4\u7ef4\u6811\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\u3002\u4f46\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u6700\u8fd1\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u5730\u533a\u7684\u751f\u9508\u5ca9\u77f3\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u90c1\u90c1\u8471\u8471\u7684\u96e8\u6797\u7684\u75d5\u8ff9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u96e8\u6797\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u65f6\u4ee3\u7eaa\u5ff5\u671f\u95f4\u6db5\u76d6\u4e861500\u4e07\u5e74\u524d\u7684\u8302\u5bc6\u96e8\u6797\u3002\n\u8be5\u7f51\u7ad9\u8fd8\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u5341\u51e0\u4e2a\u53e4\u8001\u7684arachnids\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6606\u866b\u5177\u6709\u575a\u56fa\u7684\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\uff0c\u8fc8\u514b\u5c14\u00b7\u5f17\u96f7\u6cfd\uff0c\u582a\u57f9\u62c9\u5927\u5b66\u7684\u75c5\u6bd2\u5b66\u5bb6\u548c\u53e4\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5bb6\u4ee5\u53ca\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u8005\uff0c\u5c06\u8718\u86db\u6bd4\u8f83\u201c\u6324\u538b\u888b\u201d\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u7684\u8718\u86db\u5316\u77f3\u8bb0\u5f55\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5728\u9ea6\u683c\u62c9\u65af\u5e73\u5766\u4e4b\u524d\u3002\n\u201c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5316\u77f3\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u5230\u54ea\u4e9b\u7269\u79cd\u66f4\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u201d\u9ea6\u514b\u62c9\u7279\u535a\u58eb\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u672a\u6765\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u591a\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u201d", "note_en": "Australia\u2019s Central Tablelands, hundreds of miles northwest of Sydney, are dominated today by grasses and spindly trees. But scientists recently discovered that some of the area\u2019s rusted rocks conceal traces of the lush rainforests that covered the area 15 million years ago during the Miocene Epoch.\n The area, McGraths Flat, is not Australia\u2019s only Miocene deposit, but these new fossils are a paleontological boon because of their exquisite preservation. Over the past three years paleontologists have excavated flowers, insects and even a bird\u2019s wispy feather.\n The scientists\u2019 discoveries,  published Friday in the journal Science Advances, help reconstruct Australia\u2019s Miocene rainforest in extensive detail, and the site \u201copens a whole new area of exploration for Australian paleontology,\u201d said Scott Hocknull, a paleontologist at Queensland Museum who was not involved in the research.\n Fifteen million years ago, a river carved through the jungle, leaving an oxbow lake (known as a billabong in Australia) in its wake at McGraths Flat. Nearly devoid of oxygen, this stagnant pool kept scavengers at bay, allowing plant material and animal carcasses to accumulate. As iron-rich runoff from nearby basalt mountains seeped into the billabong, the pool\u2019s low pH caused the iron to precipitate and encase the organic material. As a result, the fossils at McGraths Flat are preserved in a dense, iron-rich rock known as goethite.\n  This method of fossilization is uncommon, Dr. Hocknull said. Because quality fossils are rarely found in igneous rocks, paleontologists often overlook them. However, the fossils from McGraths Flat illustrate that goethite, which is common in Australia, can yield remarkable fossils.\n \u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of goethite,\u201d Dr. Hocknull said. \u201cWe\u2019re essentially a rusting country.\u201d\n   Because of their iron-tinted origins, many of the fossils from McGraths Flat glimmer with a metallic sheen. In addition to pristine plants, the goethite is crawling with fossilized insects. As they split apart the brick-colored slabs of stone, the researchers have discovered a miniature menagerie of giant cicadas, dragonflies and parasitic wasps. And many are remarkably preserved \u2014 some ancient flies sport the detailed imprints of their compound eyes.\n The site has also yielded more than a dozen archaic arachnids. While insects have sturdy exoskeletons, Michael Frese, a virologist and paleontologist at the University of Canberra and a co-author of the study, likens spiders to \u201csquishy bags of liquid.\u201d As a result, Australia\u2019s fossil record of spiders was nearly nonexistent before McGraths Flat.\n  The fossils are so well preserved that the paleontologists were able to observe relationships between species \u2014 something that is often difficult to parse from fossil sites, according to Matthew McCurry, the curator of paleontology at The Australian Museum and the study\u2019s lead author. For example, the team observed parasites fastened to a fish\u2019s tail and a nematode that had infiltrated a longhorn beetle.\n Dr. Frese utilized an electron microscope and microphotography techniques to examine the rainforest\u2019s inhabitants. While imaging a fossilized sawfly, Dr. Frese discovered a clump of pollen on the bee-like insect\u2019s head.\n \u201cWe can tell which flower was visited by this particular sawfly before it fell into the water and met its untimely end,\u201d Dr. Frese said. \u201cThat would not be possible if the quality of preservation was not as high.\u201d\n   The pollen also revealed that the rainforest was surrounded by drier environments, making it likely that McGraths Flat represents a remnant patch of a once larger forest. According to Dr. McCurry, this makes sense considering the climatic trends of the Miocene.\n When these insects scurried around the iron-tainted billabong, Australia was drifting northward, away from Antarctica. As it traveled, its climate drastically dried out, causing the rainforests to retract and leading to widespread extinctions.\n  The researchers believe McGraths Flat offers an intimate glimpse of how this dramatic climate transition affected particular species within the rainforest ecosystem. For instance, some insects found at McGraths Flat endured drier conditions while others are now found only in northern Australia\u2019s remnant pockets of rainforest.\n \u201cStudying these fossil ecosystems, we can see which species were better able to adapt to those changes,\u201d Dr. McCurry said. \u201cWe can potentially predict which are most at risk in terms of future changes.\u201d\n Dr. Frese said that McGraths Flat was particularly useful for reconstructing ancient ecosystems because of the breadth of species it preserved.\n \u201cOur site is different because it\u2019s all small fossils, but in the end, I think it will tell us more about what has happened in the ecosystem,\u201d Dr. Frese said. \u201cYou do not need to find a one-ton terror bird to tell this story.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-10 05:43:04", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "rust,\u96e8\u6797,prehistoric,\u53d8\u5316", "title": "\u53f2\u524d\u96e8\u6797\u7684\u5316\u77f3\u5728\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u751f\u9508\u7684\u5ca9\u77f3\u91cc\u85cf\u8d77\u6765", "title_en": "Fossils of a Prehistoric Rainforest Hide in Australia\u2019s Rusted Rocks", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/07/science/fossils-australia-rainforest.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["rust", "\u96e8\u6797", "\u53d8\u5316"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7cf484ceeae6bc7fc2161eddc603cd15.jpg", "infoid": 1072563, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u8981\u5e26\u9886\u6280\u672f\u6821\u6b63\u7ebf\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e00\u4e0b\uff1a\n\u572890\u5e74\u4ee3\u56de\u6765\uff0c\u6211\u5728\u5927\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u6211\u50cf\u5176\u4ed6\u6bcf\u4f4d\u5458\u5de5\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u5728\u6211\u7684\u684c\u5b50\u4e0a\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ca1\u6709\u58c1\u7684\u516c\u5171\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u3002\u6211\u5b89\u88c5\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aweb\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u548cpoof-instant\u7f51\u7ad9\u3002\u5982\u4eca\uff0c\u4ece\u5bb6\u91cc\u8fd0\u884c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f51\u7ad9\u5c31\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u80fd\u6ca1\u6709\u516c\u5171IP\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4e0d\u65f6\u66f4\u6539\u3002\u5373\u4fbf\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u60a8\u7684ISP\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u963b\u6b62\u60a8\u5728\u5176\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u3002\n\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u65c5\u884c\u5730\u7403\uff0c\u60a8\u7684IP\u5c06\u8ddf\u968f\u60a8\uff1a\u5728\u98de\u673a\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ece\u5927\u9646\u5230\u5927\u9646\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u4f55\u5904\u3002 yggdrasil\u4f1a\u627e\u5230\u4f60\u3002", "note_en": "I\u2019m going to lead with the technical punch line, and then explain it:\n Yggdrasil Network is an opportunistic mesh that can be deployed privately or as part of a global-scale network. Each node gets a stable IPv6 address (or even an entire /64) that is derived from its public key and is bound to that node as long as the node wants it (of course, it can generate a new keypair anytime) and is valid wherever the node joins the mesh. All traffic is end-to-end encrypted.\n Yggdrasil will automatically discover peers on a LAN via broadcast beacons, and requires zero configuration to peer in such a way. It can also run as an overlay network atop the public Internet. Public peers serve as places to join the global network, and since it\u2019s a mesh, if one device on your LAN joins the global network, the others will automatically have visibility on it also, thanks to the mesh routing.\n It neatly solves a lot of problems of portability (my ssh sessions stay live as I move networks, for instance), VPN (incoming ports aren\u2019t required since local nodes can connect to a public peer via an outbound connection), security, and so forth.\n   Every device on the Internet, at one time, had its own globally-unique IP address. This number was its identifier to the world; with an IP address, you can connect to any machine anywhere. Even now, when you connect to a computer to download a webpage or send a message, under the hood, your computer is talking to the other one by IP address.\n Only, now it\u2019s hard to get one. The Internet protocol we all grew up with, version 4 (IPv4), didn\u2019t have enough addresses for the explosive growth we\u2019ve seen. Internet providers and IT departments had to use a trick called NAT (Network Address Translation) to give you a sort of fake IP address, so they could put hundreds or thousands of devices behind a single public one. That, plus the mobility of devices \u2014 changing IPs whenever they change locations \u2014 has meant that a fundamental rule of the old Internet is now broken:\n  Nowadays, you can\u2019t you host your own website from your phone. Or share files from your house. (Without, that is, the use of some third-party service that locks you down and acts as an intermediary.)\n Back in the 90s, I worked at a university, and I, like every other employee, had a PC on my desk with an unfirewalled public IP. I installed a webserver, and poof \u2013 instant website. Nowadays, running a website from home is just about impossible. You may not have a public IP, and if you do, it likely changes from time to time. And even then, your ISP probably blocks you from running servers on it.\n In short, you have to buy your way into the resources to participate on the Internet.\n I wrote about these problems in more detail in my article  Recovering Our Lost Free Will Online.\n  I already gave away the punch line at the top. But what does all that mean?\n  Every device that participates gets an IP address that is fully live on the Yggdrasil network.\n You can host a website, or a mail server, or whatever you like with your Yggdrasil IP.\n Encryption and authentication are smaller (though not nonexistent) worries thanks to the built-in end-to-end encryption.\n You can travel the globe, and your IP will follow you: onto a plane, from continent to continent, wherever. Yggdrasil will find you.\n  I\u2019ve set up /etc/hosts on my laptop to use the Yggdrasil IPs for other machines on my LAN. Now I can just \u201cssh foo\u201d and it will work \u2014 from home, from a coffee shop, from a 4G tether, wherever. Now, other tools like tinc can do this, obviously. And I could stop there; I could have a completely closed, private Yggdrasil network.\n Or, I can join the global Yggdrasil network. Each device, in addition to accepting peers it finds on the LAN, can also be configured to establish outbound peering connections or accept inbound ones over the Internet. Put a public peer or two in your configuration and you\u2019ve joined the global network. Most people will probably want to do that on every device (because why not?), but you could also do that from just one device on your LAN. Again, there\u2019s no need to explicitly build routes via it; your other machines on the LAN will discover the route\u2019s existence and use it.\n This is one of many projects that are working to democratize and decentralize the Internet. So far, it has been quite successful, growing to over 2000 nodes.

The  Florida-sized glacier has gotten the nickname the \u201cdoomsday glacier\u201d because of how much ice it has and how much seas could rise if it all melts \u2014 more than two feet (65 centimeters) over hundreds of years.\n Because of its importance, the United States and the United Kingdom are in the midst of  a joint $50 million mission to study Thwaites, the widest glacier in the world by land and sea. Not near any of the continent\u2019s research stations, Thwaites is on Antarctica\u2019s western half, east of the jutting Antarctic Peninsula, which used to be the area scientists worried most about.\n   \u201cThwaites is the main reason I would say that we have so large an uncertainty in the projections of future sea level rise and that is because it\u2019s a very remote area, difficult to reach,\u201d Anna Wahlin, an oceanographer from the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, said Wednesday in an interview from the  Research Vessel Nathaniel B. Palmer, which was scheduled to leave its port in Chile hours later. \u201cIt is configured in a way so that it\u2019s potentially unstable. And that is why we are worried about this.\u201d\n Thwaites is putting about 50 billion tons of ice into the water a year. The British Antarctic Survey says the glacier is responsible for 4% of global sea rise, and the conditions leading to it to lose more ice are accelerating, University of Colorado ice scientist Ted Scambos said from the McMurdo land station last month.\n Oregon State University ice scientist Erin Pettit said Thwaites appears to be collapsing in three ways:\n  \u2014 The land part of the glacier \u201cis losing its grip\u201d to the place it attaches to the seabed, so a large chunk can come off into the ocean and later melt.\n \u2014 The glacier\u2019s ice shelf is breaking into hundreds of fractures like a damaged car windshield. This is what Pettit said she fears will be the most troublesome with six-mile (10-kilometer) long cracks forming in just a year.\n No one has stepped foot on the key ice-water interface at Thwaites before. In 2019, Wahlin was on a team that explored the area from a ship using a robotic ship but never went ashore.\n  Wahlin\u2019s team will use two robot ships \u2014 her own large one called Ran which she used in 2019 and the more agile  Boaty McBoatface, the crowdsource named drone that could go further under the area of Thwaites that protrudes over the ocean \u2014 to get under Thwaites.\n The ship-bound scientists will be measuring water temperature, the sea floor and ice thickness. They\u2019ll look at cracks in the ice, how the ice is structured and tag seals on islands off the glacier.\n Thwaites \u201clooks different from other ice shelves,\u201d Wahlin said. \u201cIt almost looks like a jumble of icebergs that have been pressed together. So it\u2019s increasingly clear that this is not a solid piece of ice like the other ice shelves are, nice smooth solid ice. This was much more jagged and scarred.\u201d\n      The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
