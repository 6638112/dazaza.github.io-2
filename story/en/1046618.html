The decision quickly drew fire.</p><p> Robinhood通过取消交易费和简化股票交易吸引了数百万千禧一代在其平台上进行交易，该公司周四早些时候表示，它将限制购买那些引发GameStop股价大幅上涨的证券。疯狂的游戏零售商，AMC娱乐控股公司，电影院连锁店以及许多其他公司。这项决定很快引起了轰动。</p><p> Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive icon who represents parts of New York, called Robinhood’s move “unacceptable.”</p><p> 代表纽约部分地区的进步偶像代表亚历山大·奥卡西奥·科尔特斯（Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez）称罗宾汉的举动“不可接受”。</p><p> “We now need to know more about Robinhood’s decision to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit,” she  wrote on Twitter. “As a member of the Financial Services Committee, I’d support a hearing if necessary.”</p><p> 她在推特上写道：“我们现在需要更多地了解罗宾汉决定阻止散户投资者购买股票，而对冲基金可以自由交易其认为合适的股票，” “作为金融服务委员会的成员，如有必要，我将支持听证会。”</p><p> Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who often is a foil of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and who helped lead the push against certification of the presidential election results,  replied: “Fully agree.”</p><p> 德克萨斯州共和党参议员特德·克鲁兹（Ted Cruz）经常是奥卡西奥·科尔特斯（Ocasio-Cortez）女士的陪衬人，并曾协助领导反对总统选举结果的证明。他回答：“完全同意。”</p><p> Customers flooded Google’s Play Store with angry, one-star reviews about the restrictions, tanking its average rating to 1 star out of 5.</p><p> 客户对这些限制充满愤怒的一星级评论，充斥着Google的Play商店，将其平均评分提高到5分中的1星。 </p><p> “Manipulating the market in favour of Wall St. Completely undemocratic, the exact opposite of their motto,” wrote one reviewer. “Well, steal from the rich and give to the poor, unless you try to take from the rich directly, in which case the app won’t work anymore.

The bill allocates billions of dollars of federal pandemic relief to help tenants pay their back rent.</p><p>加利福尼亚州立法机构周四投票，为受冠状病毒大流行打击的租房者提供一定程度的安全保障。该法案分配了数十亿美元的联邦大流行救助资金，以帮助租户偿还租金。</p><p> “The state’s housing crisis wasn’t created by Covid, and this bill alone certainly doesn’t solve it,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement. “While we’ve got to recommit to housing affordability more broadly, this bill protects against the worst economic impacts of the pandemic in a balanced and equitable way.”</p><p> 州长加文·纽瑟姆（Gavin Newsom）在一份声明中说：“该州的住房危机不是由科维德（Covid）造成的，仅靠这项法案当然无法解决。 “尽管我们必须更广泛地致力于住房可负担性，但该法案以平衡和公平的方式保护了该流行病的最坏经济影响。”</p><p> The vote came as other states as well as the federal government have moved to provide relief to tenants. President Biden, in one of his administration’s first acts, added two months to a  federal eviction moratorium that was due to expire at the end of January. Meantime, state legislatures and city councils are beginning to deploy $25 billion in  rental assistance from a  $900 billion federal stimulus package passed late last year.</p><p> 投票是在其他州以及联邦政府已采取行动向租户提供救济的同时进行的。拜登（Biden）总统是政府的首批行动之一，将联邦驱逐令延长了两个月，该禁令将于1月底到期。与此同时，各州立法机关和市议会已开始从去年底通过的9000亿美元联邦刺激计划中拨出250亿美元的租金援助。</p><p> The California deal, approved overwhelmingly, extends state eviction protections that were to expire this month. They will now stay in effect through June. The bill also allocates up to $2.6 billion in federal money to clear some tenants’ debts.</p><p> 加利福尼亚州的交易获得了压倒性的批准，扩大了本月将要到期的州驱逐保护。现在它们将一直有效到六月。该法案还分配了高达26亿美元的联邦资金，以清除一些租户的债务。</p><p> Under the legislation, the state will pay 80 percent of back rent owned by tenants who fell behind because of the pandemic and who make no more than 80 percent of their area’s median income — but only if the landlord agrees to forgive the remaining 20 percent.</p><p> 根据该立法，州将支付因大流行而落后，且收入不超过其所在地区中位数收入80％的租户所拥有的回租租金的80％，但前提是房东同意宽恕其余20％。</p><p> Tenants whose landlords won’t accept the deal can apply for state assistance that would cover 25 percent of their unpaid rent and utility bills back to April 2020. Tenants are also able to apply for assistance on up to 25 percent of their rent between April and June of this year.</p><p> 房东不接受该交易的租户可以申请国家援助，该补贴可以偿还其2020年4月之前其未付租金和水电费的25％。租户还可以在4月至2006年4月之间申请高达其租金25％的援助。今年六月。</p><p> James Goldston, the president of ABC News, said on Thursday that he would leave the network at the end of March. His exit comes weeks after Phil Griffin, the longtime president of MSNBC,  announced his own departure, and as CNN’s president, Jeffrey A. Zucker,  is deciding whether to remain in his role.</p><p> 美国广播公司新闻社总裁詹姆斯·戈德斯顿周四表示，他将于三月底离开该网络。 MSNBC的长期总裁菲尔·格里芬（Phil Griffin）宣布离职几周后，就退出了该职位。CNN总裁杰弗里·扎克（Jeffrey A.

ABC News said it had begun a search for his replacement, which will be led by Peter Rice, the powerful Walt Disney Company executive whose portfolio includes ABC.</p><p>没有宣布戈德斯顿先生的继任者。美国广播公司新闻称，已经开始寻找他的接班人，该职位将由强大的沃尔特·迪斯尼公司高管彼得·赖斯（Peter Rice）领导，他的投资组合包括美国广播公司。</p><p> TV news underwent a revival — in ratings and influence — under the Trump administration, and Mr. Goldston, who became president of ABC News in 2014, oversaw a nightly newscast, hosted by David Muir, that regularly beat the competition. Last year, ABC’s “World News Tonight” routinely ranked among the highest rated telecasts in all of broadcast and cable television, beating many entertainment and reality shows.</p><p> 在特朗普政府的领导下，电视新闻的收视率和影响力得到了复兴。2014年成为美国广播公司（ABC）新闻总裁的戈德斯顿（Goldston）监督了由大卫·缪尔（David Muir）主持的夜间新闻广播，该新闻定期击败竞争对手。去年，美国广播公司（ABC）的“今晚世界新闻”通常在所有广播和有线电视中均是收视率最高的电视广播，击败了许多娱乐和真人秀节目。</p><p> NBC News, one of ABC’s chief rivals, is adjusting to its own executive shifts. Mr. Griffin is leaving MSNBC on Feb. 1, with Rashida Jones, who supervised news programming in various roles at MSNBC and NBC News,  set to replace him. The chairman of NBC News, Andrew Lack,  exited the network last year; Cesar Conde, who ran NBCUniversal’s Spanish-language network Telemundo, now oversees the network’s news divisions.</p><p> 美国广播公司（NBC）的主要竞争对手之一，美国国家广播公司新闻社（NBC News）正在适应其自身的高管变动。格里芬先生将于2月1日离开MSNBC，而在MSNBC和NBC News担任过各种新闻节目监督的拉希达·琼斯（Rashida Jones）将接替他的职务。 NBC新闻主席安德鲁·拉克（Andrew Lack）去年退出了网络。 NBCUniversal西班牙语网Telemundo的运营人塞萨尔·孔德（Cesar Conde）现在监督该网络的新闻部门。</p><p> Mr. Zucker of CNN, whose contract extends through this year, is likely to announce a final decision about his role soon, people briefed on his thinking have said.  He has been weighing whether to exit the 24-hour news channel after tension with his new boss,  Jason Kilar, the chief executive of WarnerMedia.</p><p> 知情人士说，美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）的祖克（Zucker）的合同将延续至今年，他可能很快会宣布关于他的角色的最终决定。在与新任老板华纳传媒（WarnerMedia）首席执行官杰森·基拉尔（Jason Kilar）关系紧张之后，他一直在考虑是否退出24小时新闻频道。</p><p> But there are some signs that Mr. Zucker may stick around longer. CNN is in the midst of a record ratings streak and has dominated cable news since Election Day, pulling its biggest viewership in its history. And Mr. Kilar, after holding meetings with key CNN anchors and executives, has effusively praised Mr. Zucker in interviews.</p><p> 但是，有迹象表明，扎克可能会坚持更长的时间。自选举日以来，美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）收视率处于创纪录水平，并在有线电视新闻中占据主导地位，吸引了有史以来最大的收视率。基拉尔先生在与美国有线电视新闻网的主要主持人和高管举行会议之后，在采访中热烈赞扬了祖克先生。</p><p> American Airlines said it was working to rebook customers after a regional subsidiary grounded much of its fleet for inspections.</p><p> 美国航空表示，在一家地区子公司将其大部分机队停飞进行检查之后，它正在努力重新预订客户。</p><p> The wholly owned subsidiary, PSA Airlines, took most of its 130 planes out of service to complete what American described in a statement as a “necessary, standard inspection” of nuts and bolts on the nose gear of the affected aircraft. PSA flies two types of planes, both manufactured by Bombardier.</p><p> 全资子公司PSA航空公司停止了其130架飞机的大部分服务，以完成美国航空在一份声明中所描述的对受影响飞机前起落架上的螺母和螺栓的“必要的标准检查”。 PSA有两种类型的飞机，均由庞巴迪公司制造。 </p><p> PSA had canceled more than 200 flights as of early Thursday night, according to FlightAware, a flight-tracking website.

Many of those planes have been sidelined as the coronavirus pandemic stifles demand for flights. On Wednesday, just over 530,000 people were screened at federal airport security checkpoints, roughly 30 percent of the traffic on the same day last year, according to the Transportation Security Administration.</p><p> 美国航空机队中有近900架飞机，其中不包括由总部位于俄亥俄州代顿的PSA等子公司运营的飞机。由于冠状病毒大流行扼杀了对飞行的需求，其中许多飞机已被淘汰。根据美国运输安全管理局的数据，在周三，只有53万人在联邦机场安全检查站接受了检查，大约占去年同一天的30％。</p><p> News of the PSA groundings came on a busy day for American, which  reported its full-year financial results Thursday. The airline’s stock also soared early in the day as the carrier found itself in the middle of  a war of wills involving amateur and professional traders.</p><p> 有关PSA停飞的消息对于美国航空来说是忙碌的一天，该公司周四报告了其全年财务业绩。当天早些时候，该航空公司的股票也飙升，因为该公司发现自己陷入了涉及业余和专业商人的遗嘱战争之中。</p><p>  GameStop’s roller coaster continued Thursday, with shares in the company rallying late in the day after the stock-trading app Robinhood said it would allow its customers to resume trading on the company.</p><p>  GameStop的过山车在周四继续进行，股票交易应用程序Robinhood表示将允许其客户恢复在该公司的交易后，该公司的股票在当天晚些时候上涨。</p><p> The stock, which had ended the regular trading session down 44 percent, rose 34 percent in after hours trading. The drop earlier in the day had come as  Robinhood and other trading platforms said they would limit the ability to buy certain securities.</p><p> 该股在常规交易时段下跌了44％，在盘后交易中上涨了34％。当天早些时候下跌是因为罗宾汉和其他交易平台表示将限制购买某些证券的能力。</p><p> It’s the latest turn in a week of wild trading in shares of GameStop and other companies that have been bid up in a frenzy of activity by small investors. These include AMC Entertainment, which rose 22 percent in after-hours trading, also after having suffered a steep loss earlier, and BlackBerry, which was up about 8 percent after dropping 41 percent.</p><p> 这是一周以来GameStop和其他公司的疯狂交易的最新转折，这些公司在小投资者的狂热活动中被竞购。其中包括AMC娱乐公司，该公司在盘后交易中上涨了22％，此前也遭受了惨重的损失；黑莓公司的股价在下跌了41％之后上涨了8％。 </p><p>  “Starting tomorrow, we plan to allow limited buys of these securities. We’ll continue to monitor the situation and may make adjustments as needed,” Robinhood said in blog post on Thursday afternoon, as it explained why it had put limits on trading — like allowing its users only to sell shares — earlier in the day.</p><p>“从明天开始，我们计划允许有限购买这些证券。我们将继续监视局势，并可能根据需要进行调整，”罗宾汉（Robinhood）在周四下午发表的博客文章中说道，因为它解释了为什么在当天早些时候对交易设置了限制，例如只允许用户出售股票。</p><p> “To be clear, this was a risk-management decision, and was not made on the direction of the market makers we route to,” the company said, referring to the large trading firms who pay Robinhood for the app’s business.</p><p> 该公司表示：“要明确的是，这是一项风险管理决定，而不是我们所选择的做市商的指导。”该公司指的是为该应用的业务支付了Robinhood费用的大型贸易公司。</p><p>  The run on GameStop this month — the stock had surged 1,700 percent through Wednesday, giving the company an astonishing market valuation of $24 billion — means it has become detached from the factors that traditionally help establish a company’s value to investors, like growth potential or profits.</p><p>  本月GameStop的运行-截至周三，该股上涨了1,700％，使该公司的市值达到了惊人的240亿美元-意味着它已脱离传统上有助于为投资者建立公司价值的因素，例如增长潜力或利润。</p><p> But the traders who piled in were part of a frenzy that originated on a Reddit message board,  WallStreetBets, a community known for irreverent market discussions, and on messaging platforms like Discord.</p><p> 但是，大量涌入的交易员是狂热活动的一部分，这种狂热源于Reddit留言板WallStreetBets，该社区以无休止的市场讨论而闻名，以及Discord等消息传递平台。</p><p>  Egged on by the message boards, these traders had rushed to buy options contracts that would profit from a rise in the share price. That trading can create  a feedback loop that drives the underlying share prices higher, as brokerage firms that sell the options have to buy shares as a hedge.</p><p>  这些交易员在留言板的怂恿下，匆忙购买了将从股价上涨中获利的期权合约。由于出售期权的经纪公司必须购买股票作为对冲，因此这种交易会形成一个反馈回路，从而带动基础股价上涨。</p><p> That spike  has hit hedge funds that had been betting against the stock. Those funds have closed out the so-called short positions at sometimes big losses. It has also raised scrutiny of the trading platforms, with the  Securities and Exchange Commission saying Wednesday it was “actively monitoring” the volatile trading.</p><p> 这一飙升打击了一直押注该股的对冲基金。这些基金平仓了有时会造成巨大损失的所谓空头头寸。它还对交易平台进行了审查，美国证券交易委员会（Securities and Exchange Commission）周三表示，它正在“积极监测”动荡交易。</p><p> More than a decade ago, the billionaire family that controlled the sports car maker Porsche clashed with a group of prominent American hedge funds in a struggle for power and riches that in some ways foreshadowed the wild trading in GameStop. Volkswagen shares briefly soared to heights far beyond what the company was worth. It all ended badly for the hedge funds.</p><p> 十多年前，控制跑车制造商保时捷的亿万富翁家族与一群美国著名对冲基金发生冲突，争夺权力和财富，这在某种程度上预示了GameStop的疯狂交易。大众汽车的股价一度飙升至远远超出该公司的市值。对冲基金的一切都以惨败告终。 </p><p> In 2008, Porsche Holding, the family company that owned the automaker, made an audacious bid for control of Volkswagen. The Porsche family and Volkswagen had been closely intertwined ever since Ferdinand Porsche, the family patriarch, designed the Beetle for Adolf Hitler. But the family never had formal ownership of Volkswagen, and Ferdinand Porsche’s descendants wanted to reclaim what they saw as the family legacy.</p><p>2008年，拥有该汽车制造商的家族企业保时捷控股公司（Porsche Holding）大胆地竞购了大众汽车的控制权。自家族祖先费迪南德·保时捷（Ferdinand Porsche）为阿道夫·希特勒（Adolf Hitler）设计甲壳虫以来，保时捷家族和大众一直紧密地交织在一起。但是这个家族从来没有正式拥有大众汽车的所有权，费迪南德·保时捷的后代想收回他们认为是家族的遗产。</p><p> At the time, Porsche, the carmaker, was small but highly profitable while Volkswagen, the biggest automaker in Europe, was out of favor with investors. Porsche Holding used derivatives to get control of a majority of Volkswagen shares, which were relatively cheap, without owning them outright.</p><p> 当时，汽车制造商保时捷虽然规模很小，但利润却很高，而欧洲最大的汽车制造商大众汽车则不受欢迎。保时捷控股公司使用衍生工具来控制大众汽车的大部分股份，这些股份相对便宜，却没有完全拥有。</p><p> For a while, the plan seemed to be working. But then the collapse of Lehman Bros. in September 2008 threw financial markets into turmoil. Volkswagen shares plunged, generating billions of euros in losses for Porsche Holding, according to later court testimony.</p><p> 一段时间以来，该计划似乎正在奏效。但随后，雷曼兄弟（Lehman Bros.）在2008年9月倒闭，金融市场陷入动荡。根据后来的法庭证词，大众汽车股价暴跌，给保时捷控股公司造成数十亿欧元的损失。</p><p> Hedge funds, including Elliott Management, smelled an opportunity. They began betting that Volkswagen shares would fall further, hoping to profit from Porsche Holding’s distress.</p><p> 对冲基金，包括埃利奥特管理公司（Elliott Management），都抓住了机会。他们开始押注大众汽车的股价将进一步下跌，希望从保时捷控股的困境中获利。</p><p> The battle reached a climax in late October 2008. Porsche Holding issued a statement that hedge funds later contended created the false impression that almost all of Volkswagen’s voting shares were locked up and implied that few shares were left for the hedge funds to cover their bets, exposing them to huge losses.</p><p> 这场争斗在2008年10月下旬达到了高潮。保时捷控股公司发表声明，对冲基金随后进行了争辩，产生了错误的印象，即几乎所有大众的有表决权的股票都被锁定了，这意味着对冲基金只剩下很少的股份来支付押注，使他们遭受巨大损失。</p><p>  In the panic buying that followed, Volkswagen shares rose so much that it was  briefly the most valuable company in the world. It was a “short squeeze” much like the one investors on Reddit created for GameStop shares.</p><p>  在随后的恐慌性购买中，大众汽车的股价大涨，短暂地成为全球市值最高的公司。这就像在Reddit上为GameStop股票创建的一位投资者一样，是“短暂的挤压”。</p><p> The October statement rescued Porsche’s takeover bid, allowing the family company to acquire majority voting rights in Volkswagen. Porsche is now a unit of the larger company.</p><p> 十月份的声明挽救了保时捷的收购要约，使该家族公司能够获得大众汽车的多数表决权。保时捷现在是大公司的一个部门。 </p><p> The hedge funds lost billions of euros and  sued Porsche Holding, saying the statement was an illegal attempt to manipulate the shares.
