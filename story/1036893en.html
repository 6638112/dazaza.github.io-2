They came to hear him lecture on his ideas and research in diverse fields such as human judgment, decision making and behavioral economics and well-being.</p><p> 我与他的讨论激发了卡尼曼（Kahneman）为7月在加利福尼亚州纳帕市举行的为期20天的“大师班”授课的机会，该小组由二十名美国领先的商业/互联网/文化创新者组成，这是美国商业最近占主导地位的部门的缩影。他们来听他讲授关于他的思想和研究的各个领域，这些领域包括人类的判断力，决策能力，行为经济学和幸福感。</p><p>  While Kahneman has a wide following among people who study risk, decision-making, and other aspects of human judgment, he is not exactly a household name. Yet among many of the top thinkers in psychology, he ranks at the top of the field.</p><p>  尽管卡尼曼在研究风险，决策和其他方面人类判断的人中拥有广泛的支持者，但他并非家喻户晓。然而，在许多心理学顶级思想家中，他名列前茅。</p><p> Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert ( Stumbling on Happiness) writes: &#34;Danny Kahneman is simply the most distinguished living psychologist in the world, bar none. Trying to say something smart about Danny&#39;s contributions to science is like trying to say something smart about water: It is everywhere, in everything, and a world without it would be a world unimaginably different than this one.&#34; And according to Harvard&#39;s Steven Pinker ( The Stuff of Thought): &#34;It&#39;s not an exaggeration to say that Kahneman is one of the most influential psychologists in history and certainly the most important psychologist alive today. He has made seminal contributions over a wide range of fields including social psychology, cognitive science, reasoning and thinking, and behavioral economics, a field he and his partner Amos Tversky invented.&#34;</p><p> 哈佛大学心理学家丹尼尔·吉尔伯特（丹尼尔·吉尔伯特）写道：“丹尼·卡尼曼（Danny Kahneman）简直是世界上最杰出的生活心理学家，没有人禁止。要对丹尼（Danny）对科学的贡献做出明智的表述，就像是要对水说些聪明的话：无论在任何地方，在任何事物上，以及没有它的世界，都将是与这个世界不可想象的不同。”哈佛大学的史蒂芬·平克（Steven Pinker）说：“毫不夸张地说，卡尼曼是历史上最有影响力的心理学家之一，当然也是当今最重要的心理学家。他在许多方面做出了开创性的贡献。他和他的搭档阿莫斯·特维尔斯基（Amos Tversky）发明了一个领域，包括社会心理学，认知科学，推理和思维以及行为经济学。”</p><p>  Here are some examples from the national media which illustrate how Kahneman&#39;s ideas are reflected in the public conversation:</p><p>  以下是一些来自国家媒体的示例，这些示例说明了卡尼曼的思想如何在公众对话中得到体现：</p><p> In the  Economist &#34;Happiness &amp; Economics &#34; issue in December, 2006, Kahneman is credited with the new hedonimetry regarding his argument that people are not as mysterious as less nosy economists supposed. &#34;The view that hedonic states cannot be measured because they are private events is widely held but incorrect.&#34;</p><p>在2006年12月的《经济学家》（幸福与经济学）一书中，卡尼曼（Kahneman）因其关于人们不像经济学家所想象的那样神秘而论点的论点而被认为是一种新的测斜法。 “享乐主义状态不能被衡量，因为它们是私人事件，这一观点得到了广泛认可，但却是错误的。”</p><p> Paul Krugman, in his  New York Times column, &#34;Quagmire Of The Vanities&#34; (January 8, 2007), asks if the proponents of the &#34;surge&#34; in Iraq are cynical or delusional. He presents Kahneman&#39;s view that &#34;the administration&#39;s unwillingness to face reality in Iraq reflects a basic human aversion to cutting one&#39;s losses—the same instinct that makes gamblers stay at the table, hoping to break even.&#34;</p><p> 保罗·克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman）在他的《纽约时报》专栏“虚荣四面楚歌”（2007年1月8日）中问，伊拉克“激增”的拥护者是愤世嫉俗还是妄想。他提出了卡尼曼的观点，即“政府不愿在伊拉克面对现实，反映了人类对削减损失的基本厌恶-这是使赌徒留在桌子旁，希望实现收支平衡的本能”。</p><p> His articles have been picked up by the press and written about extensively. The most recent example is Jim Holt&#39;s lede piece in  The New York Times Magazine, &#34;You are What You Expect&#34; (January 21, 2007), an article about this year&#39;s  Edge Annual Question &#34;What Are You Optimistic About?&#34;. It was prefaced with a commentary regarding Kahneman&#39;s ideas on &#34;optimism bias&#34;.</p><p> 他的文章已被新闻界采摘并广泛发表。最近的例子是吉姆·霍尔特（Jim Holt）在《纽约时报》杂志上发表的一篇赞誉文章“您是您所期望的”（2007年1月21日），该文章涉及今年的年度年度问题“您对什么持乐观态度？”。它以关于卡尼曼关于“乐观主义偏见”的思想的评论作为开头。</p><p> In Jerome Groopman&#39;s  New Yorker article, &#34;What&#39;s the trouble? How Doctors Think&#34; (January 29, 2007), Groopman looks at a medical misdiagnosis through the prism of a heuristic called &#34;availability,&#34; which refers to the tendency to judge the likelihood of an event by the ease with which relevant examples come to mind. This tendency was first described in 1973, in Kahneman&#39;s paper with Amos Tversky when they were psychologists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p><p> 在杰罗姆·格鲁普曼（Jerome Groopman）在《纽约客》的文章“有什么问题？医生的想法”（2007年1月29日）中，格鲁普曼通过启发式的“可用性”来看待医学上的误诊，指的是倾向于判断通过轻松想到相关示例来进行事件。这种趋势最早是在1973年在卡内尼曼（Kahneman）与耶路撒冷希伯来大学的心理学家阿莫斯·特维尔斯基（Amos Tversky）的论文中描述的。</p><p> Kahneman&#39;s article (with Jonathan Renshon) &#34;Why Hawks Win&#34; was published in  Foreign Policy (January/February 2007); Kahneman points out that the answer may lie deep in the human mind. People have dozens of decision-making biases, and almost all favor conflict rather than concession. The article takes a look at why the tough guys win more than they should. Publication came during the run up to Davis, and the article became a focus of numerous discussions and related articles.</p><p> Kahneman的文章（与Jonathan Renshon一起发表）“为什么赢得鹰派”发表在《外交政策》（2007年1月/ 2月）上；卡尼曼指出，答案可能在于人的思想深处。人们在决策上有许多偏见，几乎所有人都赞成冲突而不是让步。本文介绍了为什么硬汉赢了比他们应该多的钱。出版物是在戴维斯（Davis）出生之前编写的，该文章成为众多讨论和相关文章的重点。</p><p> The event was an unqualified success. As one of the attendees later wrote: &#34;Even with the perspective a few weeks, I can still think it is one of the all time best conferences that I have ever attended.&#34;</p><p> 这次活动取得了无与伦比的成功。正如其中一位与会者后来写道：“即使从几周的角度来看，我仍然可以认为这是我参加过的有史以来最好的会议之一。”</p><p>  Over a period of two days, Kahneman presided over six sessions lasting about eight hours. The entire event was videotaped as an archive.  Edge is pleased to present a sampling from the event consisting of streaming video of the first 10-15 minutes of each session along with the related verbatim transcripts.</p><p>  在两天的时间里，卡尼曼主持了六个会议，持续了大约八个小时。整个活动都被录像为存档。 Edge很高兴地提供该事件的样本，该样本包括每个会话的前10-15分钟的流式视频以及相关的逐字记录。</p><p>  DANIEL KAHNEMAN is Eugene Higgins Professor of Psychology, Princeton University, and Professor of Public Affairs, Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. He is winner of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his pioneering work integrating insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty.</p><p>DANIEL KAHNEMAN是普林斯顿大学的尤金·希金斯心理学教授，以及伍德罗·威尔逊公共和国际事务学院公共事务教授。他的开创性工作将心理学研究的见解与经济科学相结合，尤其是在不确定性下的人类判断和决策方面，他获得了2002年诺贝尔经济学奖。</p><p>    I&#39;ll start with a topic that is called an inside-outside view of the planning fallacy. And it starts with a personal story, which is a true story....</p><p>    我将从一个称为计划谬误的内外视图的主题开始。它从一个个人故事开始，这是一个真实的故事。</p><p>  KAHNEMAN: I&#39;ll start with a topic that is called an inside-outside view of the planning fallacy. And it starts with a personal story, which is a true story.</p><p>  卡内曼：我将从一个称为计划谬误的内外视图的话题开始。它始于个人故事，这是一个真实的故事。</p><p>  Well over 30 years ago I was in Israel, already working on judgment and decision making, and the idea came up to write a curriculum to teach judgment and decision making in high schools without mathematics. I put together a group of people that included some experienced teachers and some assistants, as well as the Dean of the School of Education at the time, who was a curriculum expert. We worked on writing the textbook as a group for about a year, and it was going pretty well—we had written a couple of chapters, we had given a couple of sample lessons. There was a great sense that we were making progress. We used to meet every Friday afternoon, and one day we had been talking about how to elicit information from groups and how to think about the future, and so I said, Let&#39;s see how we think about the future.</p><p>  大约30年前，我在以色列工作，已经从事判断和决策制定工作，后来想到编写一门课程，在没有数学的高中教授判断和决策制定工作。我聚集了一群人，其中包括一些经验丰富的老师和一些助手，以及当时的教育学院院长，他是课程专家。我们以小组的形式编写该教科书大约一年，而且进展顺利–我们编写了几章，并提供了一些示例课程。很有感觉，我们正在取得进步。我们曾经在每个星期五下午开会，有一天我们一直在谈论如何从团体中获取信息以及如何思考未来，所以我说，让我们看看我们如何思考未来。</p><p> I asked everybody to write down on a slip of paper his or her estimate of the date on which we would hand the draft of the book over to the Ministry of Education. That by itself by the way was something that we had learned: you don&#39;t want to start by discussing something, you want to start by eliciting as many different opinions as possible, which you then you pool. So everybody did that, and we were really quite narrowly centered around two years; the range of estimates that people had—including myself and the Dean of the School of Education—was between 18 months and two and a half years.</p><p> 我请大家在纸条上写下他或她对我们将这本书的草稿移交给教育部的日期的估计。顺便说一句，这是我们已经学到的东西：您不想从讨论某件事开始，而是想从引起尽可能多的不同意见开始，然后汇集您的意见。所以每个人都这样做了，而我们大约在两年的时间里几乎处于狭center的中心。人们（包括我本人和教育学院院长）的估计范围在18个月至2年半之间。</p><p> But then something else occurred to me, and I asked the Dean of Education of the school whether he could think of other groups similar to our group that had been involved in developing a curriculum where no curriculum had existed before. At that period—I think it was the early 70s—there was a lot of activity in the biology curriculum, and in mathematics, and so he said, yes, he could think of quite a few. I asked him whether he knew specifically about these groups and he said there were quite a few of them about which he knew a lot. So I asked him to imagine them, thinking back to when they were at about the same state of progress we had reached, after which I asked the obvious question—how long did it take them to finish?</p><p> 但是后来又发生了其他事情，我问学校的教育学院院长，他是否可以想到其他与我们小组类似的小组，他们参与了以前没有课程的课程开发工作。在那个时期（我认为是70年代初），生物学课程和数学领域都有很多活动，因此他说，是的，他可以想到很多。我问他是否特别了解这些群体，他说他对很多人了解很多。因此，我让他想象他们，回想起他们何时达到了我们所达到的相同进展状态，此后我问了一个显而易见的问题：他们花了多长时间才能完成？</p><p> It&#39;s a story I&#39;ve told many times, so I don&#39;t know whether I remember the story or the event, but I think he blushed, because what he said then was really kind of embarrassing, which was, You know I&#39;ve never thought of it, but actually not all of them wrote a book. I asked how many, and he said roughly 40 percent of the groups he knew about never finished. By that time, there was a pall of gloom falling over the room, and I asked, of those who finished, how long did it take them? He thought for awhile and said, I cannot think of any group that finished in less than seven years and I can&#39;t think of any that went on for more than ten.</p><p> 这个故事我已经讲过很多次了，所以我不知道我是否记得这个故事或那个事件，但是我认为他脸红了，因为他当时所说的真的很尴尬，那就是，你知道我从来没有想过，但实际上并非所有人都写过书。我问了几个，他说大约40％的团体从未结束。到那时，昏暗的天空笼罩着整个房间，我问那些完成的人花了多长时间？他思考了一会儿，然后说：我想不到任何一个小组在不到七年的时间内就完成了，我也想不出任何持续了十多年的小组。</p><p> I asked one final question before doing something totally irrational, which was, in terms of resources, how good were we are at what we were doing, and where he would place us in the spectrum. His response I do remember, which was, below average, but not by much. [much laughter]</p><p>在做完全不合理的事情之前，我问了最后一个问题，那就是在资源方面，我们在做的事情上有多好，以及他将我们摆在什么位置。我确实记得他的回答，虽然低于平均水平，但幅度不大。 [大笑]</p><p> I&#39;m deeply ashamed of the rest of the story, but there was something really instructive happening here, because there are two ways of looking at a problem; the inside view and the outside view. The inside view is looking at your problem and trying to estimate what will happen in your problem. The outside view involves making that an instance of something else—of a class. When you then look at the statistics of the class, it is a very different way of thinking about problems. And what&#39;s interesting is that it is a very unnatural way to think about problems, because you have to forget things that you know—and you know everything about what you&#39;re trying to do, your plan and so on—and to look at yourself as a point in the distribution is a very un-natural exercise; people actually hate doing this and resist it.</p><p> 我为其余的故事感到羞耻，但是这里确实发生了一些很有启发性的事情，因为有两种方法可以解决问题。内部视图和外部视图。内部视图正在查看您的问题，并试图估计问题中将发生的情况。外部视图涉及将其作为类的其他实例的实例。当您查看类的统计信息时，这是一种非常不同的问题思考方式。有趣的是，这是一种思考问题的非常不自然的方式，因为您必须忘记自己知道的事情，并且对自己想做的事情，计划等都一清二楚，并仔细观察自己因为分布中的一个点是非常不自然的练习；人们实际上讨厌这样做并且拒绝这样做。</p><p> There are also many difficulties in determining the reference class. In this case, the reference class is pretty straightforward; it&#39;s other people developing curricula. But what&#39;s psychologically interesting about the incident is all of that information was in the head of the Dean of the School of Education, and still he said two years. There was no contact between something he knew and something he said. What psychologically to me was the truly insightful thing, was that he had all the information necessary to conclude that the prediction he was writing down was ridiculous.</p><p> 确定参考类别也有许多困难。在这种情况下，引用类非常简单；是其他人在开发课程。但是，从心理上讲，这件事有趣的是，所有这些信息都在教育学院院长的头上，但他仍然说了两年。他知道的东西和他说的东西之间没有联系。对我而言，在心理上真正具有洞察力的事情是，他拥有所有必要的信息，可以得出结论，即他在写下的预测是荒谬的。</p><p>  KAHNEMAN: No, he wasn&#39;t being tactful; he really didn&#39;t know. This is really something that I think happens a lot—the outside view comes up in something that I call ‘narrow framing,&#39; which is, you focus on the problem at hand and don&#39;t see the class to which it belongs. That&#39;s part of the psychology of it. There is no question as to which is more accurate—clearly the outside view, by and large, is the better way to go.</p><p>  卡尼曼：不，他不是机智的。他真的不知道。我确实认为这确实发生了很多事情–外部视图出现在我称为“狭窄框架”的事物中，也就是说，您专注于手头的问题，却看不到它所属的类。这就是它的心理学的一部分。毫无疑问，哪种方法更准确-显然，总体而言，更好的方法是。</p><p> Let me just add two elements to the story. One, which I&#39;m really ashamed of, is that obviously we should have quit. None of us was willing to spend seven years writing the bloody book. It was out of the question. We didn&#39;t stop and I think that really was the end of rational planning. When I look back on the humor of our writing a book on rationality, and going on after we knew that what we were doing was not worth doing, is not something I&#39;m proud of.</p><p> 让我在故事中添加两个元素。我真的感到ham愧的是，显然我们应该退出了。我们谁都不愿意花七年时间写这本血腥的书。这是不可能的。我们没有停下来，我认为那真的是理性计划的终结。当我回头看我们写一本关于理性的书时的幽默感，然后继续前进，直到我们知道自己在做的事不值得做时，我都不为之骄傲。</p><p>  KAHNEMAN: No, actually I wasn&#39;t there. I got divorced, I got married, I left the country. The work went on. There was a book. It took eight years to write. It was completely worthless. There were some copies printed, they were never used. That&#39;s the end of that story. ...</p><p>  卡尼曼：不，实际上我不在那儿。我离婚了，我结婚了，我离开了乡下。工作继续进行。有一本书。写了八年。这是完全毫无价值的。印刷了一些副本，但从未使用过。故事到此结束。 ...</p><p>   Let me introduce a plan for this session. I&#39;d like to take a detour, but where I would like to end up is with a realistic theory of risk taking. But I need to take a detour to make that sensible. I&#39;d like to start by telling you what I think is the idea that got me the Nobel Prize—should have gotten Amos Tversky and me the Nobel Prize because it was something that we did together—and it&#39;s an embarrassingly simple idea. I&#39;m going to tell you the personal story of this, and I call it &#34;Bernoulli&#39;s Error&#34;—the major theory of how people take risks...</p><p>   让我介绍一下本届会议的计划。我想绕道而行，但最终要讲的是关于冒险的现实理论。但是我需要绕道而行，以使其变得明智。首先，我想告诉您我想让我获得诺贝尔奖的想法-本应该获得Amos Tversky和我获得诺贝尔奖的想法，因为这是我们一起做的-这是一个令人尴尬的简单想法。我将告诉您有关此事的个人故事，我称之为“伯努利的错误”，这是人们如何冒险的主要理论...</p><p>  KAHNEMAN: Let me introduce a plan for this session.

And he had a theory that explained why people take risks. Up to that time people were evaluating gambles by expected value, but expected value was never explained with conversion, and why people prefer to get sure things rather than gambles of equal expected value. And so he introduced the idea of utility (as a psychological variable), and that&#39;s what people assign to outcomes so they&#39;re not computing the weighted average of outcomes where the weights are the probabilities, they&#39;re computing the weighted average of the utilities of outcomes. Big discovery—big step in the understanding of it. It moves the understanding of risk taking from the outside world, where you&#39;re looking at values, to the inside world, where you&#39;re looking at the assignment of utilities. That was a great contribution.</p><p> 该领域的快速历史是1738年，丹尼尔·伯努利（Daniel Bernoulli）发表了一篇宏伟的论文，其中提出了许多关于人们如何冒险的开创性思想，这些思想发表在圣彼得堡科学院。他的理论可以解释人们为什么冒险。到那时，人们一直在通过期望值来评估赌博，但是人们从来没有通过转换来解释期望值，以及为什么人们更喜欢获得确定的事物而不是期望值相等的赌博。因此，他介绍了效用（作为心理变量）的概念，这就是人们分配给结果的内容，因此他们没有计算权重为概率的结果的加权平均值，而是在计算效用的加权平均值结果。大发现-了解它的重大一步。它将对风险承担的理解从您正在研究价值的外部世界转移到了您正在研究公用事业分配的内部世界。那是一个巨大的贡献。</p><p> He was trying to understand the decisions of merchants, really, and the example that he analyzes in some depth is the example of the merchant who has a ship loaded with spices, which he is going to send from Amsterdam to St. Petersburg – during the winter—with a 5 percent probability that the ship will be lost. That&#39;s the problem. He wants to figure out how the merchant is going to do this, when the merchant is going to decide that it&#39;s worth it, and how much insurance the merchant should be willing to pay. All of this he solves. And in the process, he goes through a very elaborate derivation of logarithms. He really explains the idea.</p><p> 他实际上是在试图理解商人的决定，而他深入分析的例子是一个商人的例子，他有一艘装满香料的船，他打算在阿姆斯特丹期间将其从阿姆斯特丹送往圣彼得堡。冬季-船只将丢失的概率为5％。那就是问题所在。他想弄清楚商家将如何做到这一点，何时商家将决定是否值得，以及商家愿意支付多少保险。他解决了所有这一切。在此过程中，他经历了对数的非常精细的推导。他真的解释了这个想法。</p><p> Bernoulli starts out from the psychological insight, which is very straightforward, that losing one ducat if you have ten ducats is like losing a hundred ducats if you have a thousand. The psychological response is proportional to your wealth. That very quickly forces a logarithmic utility function. The merchant assigns a psychological value to different states of wealth and says, if the ship makes it this is how wealthy I will be; if the ship sinks this is my wealth; this is my current wealth; these are the odds; you have a logarithmic utility function, and you figure it out. You know if it&#39;s positive, you do it; if it&#39;s not positive you don&#39;t; and the difference tells you how much you&#39;d be willing to pay for insurance.</p><p> 伯努利从心理学上的洞察力出发，这很简单，那就是如果有十只鸭蛋，那么输掉一个鸭蛋就好比如果有一千只鸭蛋就输掉一百个鸭蛋。心理反应与您的财富成正比。这很快会强制执行对数效用函数。商人给不同的财富状态赋予一种心理价值，并说，如果这艘船成功了，那我将变得有钱。如果船沉没了，这就是我的财富；这是我目前的财富；这些是赔率；您有一个对数效用函数，就可以弄清楚。你知道如果它是积极的，那就去做；如果不是积极的，你就不会；差异告诉您您愿意支付多少保险费。</p><p> This is still the basic theory you learn when you study economics, and in business you basically learn variants on Bernoulli&#39;s utility theory. It&#39;s been modified, it&#39;s axiomatic and formalized, and it&#39;s no longer logarithmic necessarily, but that&#39;s the basic idea.</p><p> 这仍然是您学习经济学时所学的基本理论，而在商业中您基本上可以学到伯努利效用理论的变体。它已被修改，公理化和形式化，并且不再是对数的，但这是基本思想。</p><p> When Amos Tversky and I decided to work on this, I didn&#39;t know a thing about decision-making—it was his field of expertise. He had written a book with his teacher and a colleague called &#34;Mathematical Psychology&#34; and he gave me his copy of the book and told me to read the chapter that explained utility theory. It explained utility theory and the basic paradoxes of utility theory that have been formulated and the problems with the theory. Among the other things in that chapter were some really extraordinary people—Donald Davidson, one of the great philosophers of the twentieth century, Patrick Suppes—who had fallen love with the modern version of expected utility theory and had tried to measure the utility of money by actually running experiments where they asked people to choose between gambles. And that&#39;s what the chapter was about.</p><p> 当我和Amos Tversky决定从事此工作时，我对决策一无所知-这是他的专业领域。他与他的老师和一位同事写了一本书，叫做“数学心理学”，他给了我这本书的副本，并告诉我阅读解释效用理论的章节。它解释了效用理论和已经形成的效用理论的基本悖论以及该理论的问题。在该章中的其他内容包括一些非常了不起的人-唐纳德·戴维森（Donald Davidson），它是20世纪的伟大哲学家之一，帕特里克·苏佩斯（Patrick Suppes），他爱上了现代的期望效用理论，并试图衡量货币的效用通过实际运行实验，让人们在赌博之间进行选择。这就是本章的内容。</p><p> I read the chapter, but I was puzzled by something, that I didn&#39;t understand, and I assumed there was a simple answer. The gambles were formulated in terms of gains and losses, which is the way that you would normally formulate a gamble—actually there were no losses; there was always the choice between a sure thing and a probability of gaining something. But they plotted it as if you could infer the utility of wealth—the function that they drew was the utility of wealth, but the question they were asking was about gains.</p><p> 我读了本章，但是我对某些我不理解的东西感到困惑，我认为这里有一个简单的答案。赌博是根据收益和损失来制定的，这就是您通常会制定赌博的方式—实际上没有损失；在确定事物和获得事物的可能性之间总会有选择。但是他们将其绘制得好像您可以推断出财富的效用一样，他们得出的功能是财富的效用，但是他们要问的问题是关于收益。</p><p> I went back to Amos and I said, this is really weird: I don&#39;t see how you can get from gambles of gains and losses to the utility of wealth. You are not asking about wealth. As a psychologist you would know that if it demands complicated mathematical transformation, something is going wrong. If you want the utility of wealth you had better ask about wealth. If you&#39;re asking about gains, you are getting the utility of gains; you are not getting the utility of wealth. And that actually was the beginning of the theory that&#39;s called &#34;Prospect Theory,&#34; which is considered a main contribution that we made. And the contribution is what I call &#34;Bernoulli&#39;s Error&#34;. Bernoulli thought in terms of states of wealth, which maybe makes intuitive sense when you&#39;re thinking of the merchant. But that&#39;s not how you think when you&#39;re making everyday decisions. When those great philosophers went out to do their experiments measuring utility, they did the natural thing—you could gain that much, you could have that much for sure, or have a certain probability of gaining more. And wealth is not anywhere in the picture. Most of the time people think in terms of gains and losses.</p><p>我回到阿莫斯（Amos），我说，这真的很奇怪：我看不到如何从收益和损失的赌博中获取财富的效用。您不是在问财富。作为一名心理学家，您会知道，如果需要进行复杂的数学转换，就会出事了。如果您想利用财富，最好问一下财富。如果您要询问收益，那么您将获得收益的效用。您没有得到财富的效用。这实际上是称为“前景理论”的理论的开始，这被认为是我们做出的主要贡献。我所说的就是“伯努利的错误”。伯努利以财富状态来思考，这可能在您想到商人时很直观。但这不是您日常决策时的想法。当那些伟大的哲学家出去做测量效用的实验时，他们做的很自然-您可以得到那么多，可以肯定地得到那么多，或者有一定的可能性得到更多。财富不在画面中。人们大多数时候会以得失来思考。</p><p> There is no question that you can make people think in terms of wealth, but you have to frame it that way, you have to force them to think in terms of wealth. Normally they think in terms of gains and losses. Basically that&#39;s the essence of Prospect Theory. It&#39;s a theory that&#39;s defined on gains and losses. It adds a parameter to Bernoulli&#39;s theory so what I call Bernoulli&#39;s Error is that he is short one parameter.</p><p> 毫无疑问，您可以使人们以财富的方式思考，但是您必须以这种方式来构建框架，必须迫使他们以财富的方式思考。通常，他们以得失来考虑。基本上，这就是预期理论的本质。这是一个关于损益的理论。它为伯努利理论增加了一个参数，因此我称之为伯努利的错误是他是一个短参数。</p><p> I will tell you for example what this means. You have somebody who&#39;s facing a choice between having—I won&#39;t use large units, I&#39;ll use the units I use for my students—2 million, or an equal probability of having one or four. And those are states of wealth. In Bernoulli&#39;s account, that&#39;s sufficient. It&#39;s a well-defined problem. But notice that there is something that you don&#39;t know when you&#39;re doing this: you don&#39;t know how much the person has now.</p><p> 例如，我将告诉您这是什么意思。您可能会面临一个选择，就是我不会使用大型单位，我会使用我为学生使用的单位-200万，或者拥有一到四个的可能性相等。这些就是财富状态。用伯努利的帐户来说，这就足够了。这是一个明确的问题。但是请注意，执行此操作时您不知道某些事情：您不知道此人现在有多少。</p><p> So Bernoulli in effect assumes, having utilities for wealth, that your current wealth doesn&#39;t matter when you&#39;re facing that choice. You have a utility for wealth, and what you have doesn&#39;t matter. Basically the idea that you&#39;re figuring gains and losses means that what you </p><p> 因此，伯努利实际上假设拥有财富实用程序，当您面对这种选择时，当前的财富并不重要。您拥有财富的实用工具，而您拥有的则无所谓。基本上，您正在计算损益的想法意味着您</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.edge.org/events/the-edge-master-class-2007-a-short-course-in-thinking-about-thinking">https://www.edge.org/events/the-edge-master-class-2007-a-short-course-in-thinking-about-thinking</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/卡尼曼/">#卡尼曼</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/kahneman/">#kahneman</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/财富/">#财富</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
