Scientists are cultivating a flock of such experimental creations, called chimeras, by injecting potent human cells into mice, rats, pigs and cows. They hope the new combinations might one day be used to grow human organs for transplants, study human illnesses or to test new drugs.\n  In the latest advance, researchers in the U.S. and China announced earlier this month that they made embryos that combined human and monkey cells for the first time. So far, these human-monkey chimeras (pronounced ky-meer-uhs) are no more than bundles of budding cells in a lab dish, but the implications are far-reaching, ethics experts say. The use of primates so closely related to humans raises concerns about unintended consequences, animal welfare and the moral status of hybrid embryos, even if the scientific value of the work may be quite high.\n  You will be charged $  + tax (if applicable) for The Wall Street Journal.

For those of you sad that it\u2019s winter, or  bummed that bitcoin took hits today, take heart. We have lots of neat news for you today, including the evolution of lab-grown meat, a mega-acquisition in the gaming space, and even some good news for startups hoping to land an accelerator spot! Don\u2019t frown; it\u2019s going to be OK! \u2013  Alex\n  Y Combinator boosts investment terms: Gone are the days when seed-stage startups raise $37 and fuel themselves with ramen. With Big Tech salaries scaling into the stratosphere, the startup game is a different sort of wager than it once was, given that there are more pathways to tech wealth than there were in decades past. Y Combinator is following the times, boosting its traditional check to startups in its accelerator by tacking on $375,000 in the form of a SAFE. Other accelerators, it\u2019s your move.\n Take-Two buys Zynga: Perhaps the biggest piece of business news in the tech world today not involving startups was the 11-figure deal that will see gaming company Take-Two buy Zynga. The latter company saw its share price skyrocket on the news, which will see it absorbed for a blend of stock and cash. Take-Two\u2019s stock, in contrast, fell around 13% on the announcement.\n Career Karma lands $40M: You might know Career Karma as a startup that helped folks find the right coding school for themselves. But the startup, now flush with a huge Series B, wants to become the \u201cworld\u2019s largest staffing firm,\u201d its CEO told TechCrunch. Our own  Natasha Mascarenhas has the story.\n  Before we jump into another crop of startup funding rounds, I  want to note a little bit of dissonance in the market. In short, we\u2019re seeing the public markets sell off tech shares, leading to falling multiples and a perhaps less attractive exit environment. On the other hand, the private market appears content to push startup prices higher and higher. Forcing the private and public markets to line up in time could be a painful exercise for startups that miss their growth targets.\n  Who watches the watchers? Our own Haje Jan Kamps wrote up a fascinating look at the world of corporate spyware. Your employer is probably watching what you are doing, and Haje has tips. Heck, Yahoo is probably watching me type this up. Hello, corporate overlords!\n Gameto is taking on menopause: Far from the world of enterprise SaaS, there is a universe of startups working on health. But not all of them are working on nootropics or the like. Gameto wants to \u201csolve the problem of \u2018accelerated\u2019 ovarian aging to change the trajectory of women\u2019s health and equality,\u201d Connie Loizos reports. The startup is still pretty young, but it\u2019s taking on a market that is, well, half the human population. One to keep an eye on.\n Parrot wants to help Mexico\u2019s restaurants thrive in the delivery era: The move to a more delivery-and-pickup world has forced restaurants around the world to adapt. But not every market has the same tooling options or local demands. Parrot just raised $9.5 million for its work to help restaurateurs in Mexico use its point-of-sale software to \u201cdigitize and take advantage of the home delivery boom to accelerate growth,\u201d we write.\n Arive raises $20M to instantly deliver electronics: Imagine the so-called instant grocery delivery market, but swap out the foodstuffs for larger, more expensive goods like headphones and beauty products. That\u2019s what Arive wants to build, and it just raised $20 million for its work.\n ThankUCash raises $5.3M to bring loyalty programs to Africa: The African startup market continues its impressive run of funding events this week, with ThankUCash \u2013 a great startup name \u2013 raising new capital to help stores on the continent offer loyalty programs and payment services. For the many offline stores in Africa, the startup could prove to be a boon.\n Ankorstore raises epic $283M Series C: French startup Ankorstore is a unicorn in the wake of its recent huge fundraise. The startup \u201coperates a wholesale marketplace for independent retailers across Europe,\u201d we noted today, which is proving to be a rapidly scalable enterprise.\n   If you\u2019ve ever seen a lagoon filled with hog waste or driven on I-5 past the cattle feedlots in Coalinga, California, it\u2019s easy to see why there\u2019s so much interest in lab-grown meat.\n Conventional factory farming practices cause widespread environmental damage, but industry and consumers have learned to live with in exchange for affordability and convenience.

For those of you sad that it\u2019s winter, or  bummed that bitcoin took hits today, take heart. We have lots of neat news for you today, including the evolution of lab-grown meat, a mega-acquisition in the gaming space, and even some good news for startups hoping to land an accelerator spot! Don\u2019t frown; it\u2019s going to be OK! \u2013  Alex\n  Y Combinator boosts investment terms: Gone are the days when seed-stage startups raise $37 and fuel themselves with ramen. With Big Tech salaries scaling into the stratosphere, the startup game is a different sort of wager than it once was, given that there are more pathways to tech wealth than there were in decades past. Y Combinator is following the times, boosting its traditional check to startups in its accelerator by tacking on $375,000 in the form of a SAFE. Other accelerators, it\u2019s your move.\n Take-Two buys Zynga: Perhaps the biggest piece of business news in the tech world today not involving startups was the 11-figure deal that will see gaming company Take-Two buy Zynga. The latter company saw its share price skyrocket on the news, which will see it absorbed for a blend of stock and cash. Take-Two\u2019s stock, in contrast, fell around 13% on the announcement.\n Career Karma lands $40M: You might know Career Karma as a startup that helped folks find the right coding school for themselves. But the startup, now flush with a huge Series B, wants to become the \u201cworld\u2019s largest staffing firm,\u201d its CEO told TechCrunch. Our own  Natasha Mascarenhas has the story.\n  Before we jump into another crop of startup funding rounds, I  want to note a little bit of dissonance in the market. In short, we\u2019re seeing the public markets sell off tech shares, leading to falling multiples and a perhaps less attractive exit environment. On the other hand, the private market appears content to push startup prices higher and higher. Forcing the private and public markets to line up in time could be a painful exercise for startups that miss their growth targets.\n  Who watches the watchers? Our own Haje Jan Kamps wrote up a fascinating look at the world of corporate spyware. Your employer is probably watching what you are doing, and Haje has tips. Heck, Yahoo is probably watching me type this up. Hello, corporate overlords!\n Gameto is taking on menopause: Far from the world of enterprise SaaS, there is a universe of startups working on health. But not all of them are working on nootropics or the like. Gameto wants to \u201csolve the problem of \u2018accelerated\u2019 ovarian aging to change the trajectory of women\u2019s health and equality,\u201d Connie Loizos reports. The startup is still pretty young, but it\u2019s taking on a market that is, well, half the human population. One to keep an eye on.\n Parrot wants to help Mexico\u2019s restaurants thrive in the delivery era: The move to a more delivery-and-pickup world has forced restaurants around the world to adapt. But not every market has the same tooling options or local demands. Parrot just raised $9.5 million for its work to help restaurateurs in Mexico use its point-of-sale software to \u201cdigitize and take advantage of the home delivery boom to accelerate growth,\u201d we write.\n Arive raises $20M to instantly deliver electronics: Imagine the so-called instant grocery delivery market, but swap out the foodstuffs for larger, more expensive goods like headphones and beauty products. That\u2019s what Arive wants to build, and it just raised $20 million for its work.\n ThankUCash raises $5.3M to bring loyalty programs to Africa: The African startup market continues its impressive run of funding events this week, with ThankUCash \u2013 a great startup name \u2013 raising new capital to help stores on the continent offer loyalty programs and payment services. For the many offline stores in Africa, the startup could prove to be a boon.\n Ankorstore raises epic $283M Series C: French startup Ankorstore is a unicorn in the wake of its recent huge fundraise. The startup \u201coperates a wholesale marketplace for independent retailers across Europe,\u201d we noted today, which is proving to be a rapidly scalable enterprise.\n   If you\u2019ve ever seen a lagoon filled with hog waste or driven on I-5 past the cattle feedlots in Coalinga, California, it\u2019s easy to see why there\u2019s so much interest in lab-grown meat.\n Conventional factory farming practices cause widespread environmental damage, but industry and consumers have learned to live with in exchange for affordability and convenience. With consumption and population growth steadily increasing, one might even say meat is eating the world.\n In a deeply researched report for TechCrunch+, reporter Christine Hall examines the state of the cell-cultured meat industry and identifies many of the startups innovating in the sector, along with related challenges regarding production, cost and consumer interest.\n  (TechCrunch+ is our membership program, which helps founders and startup teams get ahead.

But as Wired  reported last week, a \u201cmuch broader phase of that experiment has quietly been underway since mid-November. That\u2019s when Signal made the same feature accessible to all of its users without fanfare, offering the ability to send digital payments far more private than a credit card transaction\u2014or a Bitcoin transfer\u2014to many millions of phones.\u201d\n  MobileCoin founder Joshua Goldbard told the outlet that the rollout has spurred massive adoption of the cryptocurrency, telling Wired that \u201cthere are over a hundred million devices on planet Earth right now that have the ability to turn on MobileCoin and send an end-to-end encrypted payment in five seconds or less.\u201d\n Notably, one needs to load one\u2019s wallet with the cryptocurrency first, and, as Wired notes, it is listed for sale on only a few smaller cryptocurrency exchanges, including FTX, and none yet offer it to U.S. consumers. (FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is one of many investors in MobileCoin through his quantitative trading firm and cryptocurrency liquidity provider, Alameda Research.)\n Even Americans will have access to the currency shortly, however, Goldbard told Wired, pointing to recently signed agreements, including with the cryptocurrency payment processor  Zero Hash, that should allow U.S. residents buy MobileCoin within the first few months of this year.\n  In the meantime, going worldwide has been good for MobileCoin, which last summer raised $66 million in Series B funding at a $1.066 billion valuation and, according to sources close to the company, is in the process of raising a Series C round at a valuation that one source describes as \u201cin the high single-digit billions\u201d of dollars.\n MobileCoin\u2019s growth has also raised questions about Signal and about Marlinspike, who has seemingly tried to maintain some distance between himself and MobileCoin. One apparent reason why centers on Signal employees, some of who told reporter Casey Newton last year that they viewed Signal\u2019s exploration of cryptocurrency as  risky and an invitation for bad actors to use the platform.\n A potentially bigger, but related, concern of critics is that integrating a privacy coin could cause legal headaches for Signal. As Matt Green, a cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University, told Wired last week, \u201cI\u2019m very nervous they\u2019re going to get themselves into a problematic situation by flirting with this kind of payment infrastructure when there\u2019s so much legislation and regulation around it.\u201d\n It\u2019s a valid concern. As we\u2019ve  noted\u00a0 previously, cryptocurrencies and messaging apps haven\u2019t historically mixed well owing to nervous regulators. Kik Messenger, the mobile messaging app founded by a group of University of Waterloo students in 2009, created a digital currency called Kin for its users to spend inside the platform. The project ultimately led to a years-long battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission that nearly decimated the company. Telegram, a much bigger messaging app than Signal \u2014 it claims more than 500 million monthly active users \u2014 similarly  abandoned plans to offer its own decentralized cryptocurrency to anyone with a smartphone after years of battling with the SEC.\n Even Facebook hasn\u2019t been able to gain much traction with its own cryptocurrency project, with the longtime leader of that effort, David Marcus, announcing back in November that he was  leaving the company.\n If Marcus shows up at MobileCoin, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised, but we\u2019d be even less surprised to see Marlinspike get more involved in some capacity.\n Neither Goldbard nor Marlinspike have responded to our requests today for more information, but asked if Marlinspike might consider taking over MobileCoin as CEO (the company doesn\u2019t have one), a source close to him says he is \u201cnot doing that\u201d and right now is just \u201ctaking a break.\u201d\n We\u2019ll see. We aren\u2019t promising to eat our shoes if we\u2019re wrong. (It happens!)\n For now, Marlinspike writes in his post, he will remain on Signal\u2019s board while Signal\u2019s search for a new CEO continues. Its executive chair, WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, will serve as Signal\u2019s interim CEO in the meantime.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 09:27:00", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "marlinspike,mobilecoin", "title": "Moxie Marlinspike\u6b63\u5728\u7559\u4e0b\u4fe1\u53f7;\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u6000\u7591\u4ed6\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tMoxie Marlinspike is leaving Signal; here\u2019s where we suspect he\u2019s headed and why\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/moxie-marlinspike-is-leaving-signal-heres-where-we-suspect-hes-headed-and-why/", "via": "", "real_tags": []}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5d7889e5c48566b3b4ab981b683a2f6d.jpeg", "infoid": 1072700, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6839\u636e\u5468\u4e00\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u53d1\u5e03\uff0cRIVIAN\u57282021\u5e74\u5e95\u6c47\u51fa\u4e86920\u8f86\u8f66\u3002\u6839\u636e\u517612\u6708\u4efd\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u80a1\u4e1c\uff0cRIVIAN\u6709\u8d85\u8fc771,000\u201c\u9884\u8ba2\u201d\uff08\u610f\u5473\u7740\u53ef\u9000\u8fd8\u7684\u9884\u8ba2\uff09\uff08\u5373\u9000\u8fd8\u7684\u9884\u8ba2\uff09\u3002\n\u572812\u6708\u4efd\u7684\u76c8\u5229\u547c\u53eb\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u4e24\u6b21\u63d0\u5230\u751f\u4ea7\u4f5c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7ba1\u5f26\u4e50\u961f\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u3002\n\u5c3d\u7ba1\u76ee\u6807\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6b64\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u6307\u51fa\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u662f\u201c\u4e3b\u8981\u6309\u9884\u671f\u7684\u5347\u7ea7\u201d\u3002\n\u4f5c\u4e3aRIVIAN\u53c2\u52a0\u5761\u9053\u7684\u7ade\u8d5b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u5546\u901a\u7528\u6c7d\u8f66\u548c\u798f\u7279\u6b63\u5728\u51c6\u5907\u542f\u52a8\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u7535\u52a8\u62fe\u53d6\u5361\u8f66\u3002\u798f\u7279\u8868\u793a\uff0c1\u67084\u65e5\u5c06\u57282023\u5e74\u4e2d\u671f\uff0c\u6bcf\u5e74\u5373\u5c06\u63a8\u51fa\u7684\u7535\u52a8F-150\u96f7\u7535\u62fe\u53d6\u5361\u8f66\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u80fd\u529b\u51e0\u4e4e\u662f2023\u5e74\u768415\u4e07\u8f86\u3002 F-150\u96f7\u7535\u62fe\u53d6\u5361\u8f66\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u4ea4\u4ed8\u9884\u8ba1\u57282022\u5e74\u6625\u5b63\u3002", "note_en": "Rivian delivered 920 vehicles by the end of 2021, according to a release issued Monday. Rivian has more than 71,000 \u201cpre-orders\u201d (meaning refundable reservations) for its R1T pickup trucks, according to its  letter to shareholders posted in December.\n Rivian had initially targeted production of 1,200 vehicles by the end of the year. Last month, company executives including CEO RJ Scaringe cut those expectations, saying it would likely fall a few hundred vehicles short due to supply chain issues and challenges of battery production.\n  During its earnings call in December, Scaringe referred to production as a complex orchestra on two occasions.\n \u201cIn ramping up a production system like this, it is, as I said before, a really complex orchestra,\u201d Scaringe said. \u201cSo you have hundreds of suppliers providing thousands of parts, thousands of robots within the production facility operating to prescribe movements, and then thousands of team members assembling and working to put the vehicles together.\u201d\n Despite that lowered target, Scaringe noted during that call that the company is \u201cramping largely as expected.\u201d\n \u201cThe battery constraint is really an artifact of just bringing up a highly automated line,\u201d he said in December. \u201cAnd as I said, that doesn\u2019t represent any long-term challenges for us.

Last year,  Porsche launched two new e-bikes that were designed with the spirit of the Taycan Cross Turismo. BMW has also released plans to produce  several e-bikes and other micromobility vehicles lately, as well, like its  all-electric CE 04 scooter.\n  Last month, Rivian shared plans to use some of the $13.7 billion it raised when it went public to  build a second factory in Georgia (its first is in Illinois) to double its production capacity and produce battery cells \u2013 cells which can ostensibly be used in batteries for other types of vehicles, as well.\n According to the filing, which was first revealed by  Rivian Forums, Rivian wants to expand the use of its trademark to include the following:\n Bicycles; bicycle structural parts; electric bicycles; electric bicycle structural parts; electric bicycle components specially adapted for electric bicycles, namely, battery packs, motor controllers, electric motors, throttle controls, pedal assist sensors, display consoles, wiring harnesses, sprockets, cassettes, chains; bicycle frames; bicycle pedals; bicycle horns; bicycle brakes; bicycle chains; bicycle gears; bicycle wheels; bicycle seats; bicycle tires; bicycle cranks; bicycle tags; bicycle mudguards; bicycle motors; bicycle saddles; bicycle pumps; bicycle bells; bicycle handlebars; bicycle trailers; bicycle kickstands; bicycle seat posts; fitted bicycle covers; bicycle wheel spokes; bicycle wheel rims; bicycle stands; bicycle pedal straps; bicycle parts, namely, derailleurs; bicycle water bottle cages; bicycle carriers for vehicles; pumps for bicycle tires; inner tubes for bicycle tires; bicycle parts, namely disk wheels; bicycle parts, namely brake shoes\n Rivian also recently filed a patent for an  integrated tailgate cargo system for automotive vehicle, which is essentially a tailgate bike rack that will allow drivers to carry a bike in their pickup without losing bed space.

I\u2019ve been programming since I was 11 years old, my first language was Lua. Since I started at a relatively young age it was never \u2018work\u2019 for me, It was more like a fun hobby with which I could express myself and create things (mostly games).\n  I got super into admin commands when I was 13 though, ignore the repeated table index. I was 13\u2026\n I never forced myself to \u2018work\u2019 really, it was just something I really enjoyed doing. It ended up becoming a daily thing where after school I would blow off my homework (to my mother\u2019s dismay) and spend hours making various games and scripts. This naturally become a problem when in late highschool I began to hate working on projects, jumping from project to project and never finishing anything. This eventually forced me to become a bit more organized in how I be productive.\n So, here\u2019s some tips I\u2019ve found that were helpful for staying productive and not resenting your projects in no particular order.\n  Seriously, write down what you hope to accomplish today. Make sure to be realistic in what you have time for, if your goal is to \u2018write a compiler\u2019 break it down into small steps. For that day, you could say your goal is to \u2018start tokenizer, implement basic tokens.\u2019 For an example, this is my day\u2019s plan:\n - Finish burnout journal entry - Implement basic constant support for pyuxncle - Call Cameron and ask about his day\n It\u2019s also nice to have some non-work related goals, like calling a friend or your significant other. This keeps you not entirely work-focused.\n  If your plan is to do something small on a project, don\u2019t work past that point! This keeps your mind focused on finishing the task you had planed and keeps you interested in your project! Overworking on a project has lead me to burnout countless times. If you keep a small steady pace, you will keep your enjoyment on the project for much longer.\n  If you\u2019re stumped when trying to plan out your day, take a break! It is completely fine to be unproductive! If you\u2019ve found that you\u2019re no longer motivated to work on your project, find another way to have a feeling of accomplishment for that day. Take a walk, read a book at a coffee shop, go hang with friends, anything you feel that would make you feel fulfilled for the day.\n Of course, these tips may not help if you\u2019re a wageslave and your job is to write code. But these are self-learned lessons that have helped me, and no one\u2019s situation is the same. Find what works for you and stick with it. Having a routine is probably the most important part.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 08:30:52", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7167\u987e,care", "title": "\u5026\u6020\uff0c\u81ea\u6211\u7167\u987e\u548c\u5bcc\u6709\u6210\u6548", "title_en": "Burnout, self-care and being productive", "transed": 1, "url": "https://openpunk.com/journal/burnout/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7167\u987e", "care"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072693, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u534e\u76db\u987f - \u8bc1\u5238\u548c\u4ea4\u6613\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u6b63\u51c6\u5907\u8feb\u4f7f\u5927\u578b\u79c1\u8425\u516c\u53f8\u66f4\u52a0\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u5bf9\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5d1b\u8d77\u7684\u79c1\u4eba\u7b79\u8d44\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76d1\u7763\u3002\n\u60a8\u5c06\u6536\u53d6$ +\u7a0e\u7387\uff08\u5982\u9002\u7528\uff09\u4e3a\u534e\u5c14\u8857\u65e5\u8bb0\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u6539\u5e10\u5355\u504f\u597d\u6216\u81f4\u7535\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u60a8\u5c06\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u66f4\u6539\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u6216\u6761\u6b3e\u63d0\u524d\u901a\u77e5\u60a8\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u7528\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u6765\u53d6\u6d88\u8ba2\u9605\u3002", "note_en": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Securities and Exchange Commission is preparing to force more transparency from big private companies, as regulators grow concerned about the lack of oversight of the private fundraising that has fueled their rise.\n  Private capital markets have become an  increasingly popular way for companies to raise money in the U.S. in recent decades, allowing firms to acquire funding from institutions and wealthy individuals without the regulatory burdens of going public.

Some have TVs or books or laptops. Some have blackout curtains or stuffed animals or bottles of pills. But, vast as human experience is, one thing is consistent: Everyone has once-worn clothes strewn on the furniture.\n Why? In one sense, it\u2019s obvious. The clothes are clean enough to wear again, but it feels wrong to put them back with the freshly washed ones. Since there\u2019s no designated place for worn-but-clean clothes, we improvise.\n But in a deeper sense, it\u2019s mystifying.  Why is there no dedicated place? No one is happy with clothes everywhere. Why isn\u2019t there a standard solution?\n I don\u2019t know. Many people think that you\u2019re supposed to wash every garment every time you wear it and some (nutcases) actually do this. Otherwise people don\u2019t think about it aside from feeling vaguely guilty.\n   You can put a coat rack in your bedroom. Or put up some hooks. Or reserve an area of your closet. Whatever you do, put your once-worn clothes there without guilt and watch a tiny percentage of the stress in your life disappear.\n Yes, the benefit of this is small, but the cost is  very small, which makes this the  kind of thing that\u2019s  worth doing.\n Are there analogous solutions\u2014\u201ccoat racks\u201d for other problems in life? Sometimes, but not always. There is an analogy here, but it\u2019s at the level of the problem, not the solution.\n         These are  desire paths. Many colleges have a story that when they were first built, the designers left grass everywhere at first and just paved over the footpaths that were organically created. As far as I can tell this never actually happened. (Would  you open a brand-new campus and let people tramp around in the mud?)\n But whatever. Much the same thing happened gradually over time. Here\u2019s what Michigan State University looks like from the air today.\n  For our purposes, what matters is the analogy: A  desire path is a sign that the way things are currently set up, the easiest thing to do isn\u2019t the \u201cright\u201d or intended thing.\n It\u2019s worth giving this situation a name because it helps to think about solutions. When you\u2019ve recognized a desire path, what should you do? In the previous example, we accepted that we were going to follow the desire path of leaving clothes out and we \u201cpaved the path\u201d by getting a coat rack.\n There\u2019s a  desire paths subreddit with a quarter of a million subscribers. The implication seems to be that desire paths should be paved. But sometimes things are like that and sometimes they aren\u2019t.\n  Many couples seem to have the same argument repeatedly with each person saying the same things that the other person doesn\u2019t want to hear.\n You can see this as a \u201cdesire path\u201d: Both people are following a strategy that they think gives them the best (albeit bad) chance at the outcome they want.\n How to get out of this situation? One solution is to agree on a set of  fair fighting rules. There are many of these. Some are intuitive (though not necessarily easy) things like not yelling. Some are  more advanced, like saying an argument should be limited to at most five rounds, each of which consists of presentation/response/reiteration/possible acceptance/acknowledgment phases.\n If both people follow these rules in good faith, they often find that it\u2019s more effective for getting what they want than what they were doing before. Since people like getting what they want, this creates an incentive to stick with it.\n Lesson: Here again we accepted that it was hard to stay on the intended path (not arguing) and instead made the desire path better (made arguments more productive).\n  For years, I thought I should vacuum. But since vacuuming wasn\u2019t fun, I only rarely did it after making a desperate effort and mostly my vacuum just served as a monument to what a failed and pathetic human being I was.\n And then, on one beautiful day, I was borrowing the apartment of a friend who was out of town. I thought I should clean before I left, and discovered she had a  cordless, battery-powered vacuum. The moment I switched it on, clouds parted and trumpets sang from the sky. It wasn\u2019t  quite as powerful as a normal vacuum, but it was  painless. After I bought one, I was suddenly able to vacuum whenever I wanted, like a real person, so easily that the entire issue lost salience when I was in the mood for self-loathing.\n Lesson: Sometimes you want to make the intended path (vacuuming) better rather than changing anything about the desire path (not vacuuming).\n  It seems like half the people I know have a copy of War and Peace on their nightstand. They\u2019re trapped in a cycle like this: They \u201cneed\u201d to finish War and Peace. Except they don\u2019t actually like reading War and Peace, so they don\u2019t. But they\u2019re \u201csupposed\u201d to be reading it, so they don\u2019t start another book, and every night they just look at whatever the algorithms throw on their phones. Years pass without reading any books.\n Here\u2019s my advice: Stop trying to read War and Peace. If you were going to read it, you would have done it already. At the beginning of last year, I tried an experiment where I tried to read books but  only what I truly felt like reading. The result was that I abandoned most books pretty quickly, but I also  finished more books than I had in years. Some weren\u2019t very serious\u2014and really, is a post-apocalyptic young adult novel more broadening than TV? But I also finished more \u201cserious\u201d books than when I had tried to be disciplined. If you want to read more, maybe you should stop fighting with yourself.\n Lesson: Sometimes you want a hybrid path. Here, the intended path is reading Serious Books and the desire path is drooling into your phone. The solution is to create a compromise path of reading whatever books you want to read. This is similar to how  you can run more by carefully avoiding pain.\n  Many of us are addicted to the siren call of social media and the promise that if we click our glowing rectangles in the right places they might light up so that our brains produce a little hit of dopamine. Sometimes I feel like my life is a cycle of failing to work and checking Hacker News or whatever until I eventually fall asleep in existential terror at how I spent my day. Most people seem to face this problem to some degree (perhaps minus the angst).\n A couple of years ago, a friend had just taken a long flight and was amazed at how efficient he was without access to the internet. He asked, \u201cwhy can\u2019t I recreate that environment elsewhere?\u201d\n For me, this is the most effective productivity tip: Physically unplug your router and leave your phone in the basement. You aren\u2019t allowed to get them back until you\u2019ve finished a task or a fixed amount of time has expired.\n Lesson: If you don\u2019t want to go where the desire path is going, put up a wall.\n  Say you\u2019re the mayor of an American city and you have decided that you want people to drive less. One thing you can do, of course, is create more and better alternatives like busses and trains and bike lanes.\n But, assuming that you\u2019re the mayor of a city that isn\u2019t New York, there will be some destinations where driving is much more convenient, meaning that people who can afford it will get cars. But once you already have a car, it\u2019s pretty cheap and convenient to drive it places, so people tend to do that.\n What actually seems to get people to use public transit is is expensive parking. In places where parking is costly, people use public transit. This starts a cycle where more people use transit, cities are built more densely et cetera.\n Lesson: It\u2019s the  relative appeal of the two paths that determines which one you take. You can equalize these by improving the intended path (making public transit better), obstructing the desire path (making driving worse), or a combination.\n  There\u2019s one member of house Dynomight who is generally in excellent standing except for always  always ALWAYS leaving lights on everywhere and all my attempts to counter this only seem to reinforce the behavior and know they\u2019re reading this and laughing but I will have my revenge yes I will have it.\n Erm, so in this case, the first thing I tried was asking that the lights not be left on. This worked about as well as putting up a sign asking people not to take a desire path usually works: Not at all.\n A better solution is to make the desire path less attractive. So, with the consent of the offender, I tried a new policy: If I\u2019ve already had to turn off a given light source a couple of times in a day, I should instead unscrew the lightbulb.\n This was annoying for me, of course, but it changed the incentives: Turning the switch off when leaving the room is much easier than screwing a bulb back in later.\n I maintain that this theory was solid! But it didn\u2019t work at all either: The response was to happily screw the lightbulbs back in whenever needed and never mention it or appear to be even slightly annoyed about it. I\u2019ve considered motion sensors or timers but probably I should just give up?\n   Most grad students go home over the holidays promising that they will do research. But research is hard, so they stare at their computers for a couple of hours every day without working and constantly feel guilty and eventually come back from the holidays not having accomplished anything and  also not having relaxed and recharged.\n My advice is: Stop trying! You\u2019re only hurting yourself by trying to work. Enjoy the holiday and trust that the rest will help you in the future.\n Lesson: If you\u2019re going to take the desire path no matter what, blocking it is counterproductive.\n  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 3rd leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S., with around 53 thousand per year. If caught in the (early) localized stage, it\u2019s highly curable, with  5-year survival rates of around 90%.\n The best weapon to fight CRC seems to be colonoscopy screening. The logic is that CRC almost always develops from precancerous polyps which can be detected and removed before cancer has even formed. We don\u2019t have randomized trials that prove that colonoscopies reduce CRC mortality, but  Doubeni et al. used a fancy statistical technique (matched pairs) to try to estimate effectiveness from observational data, which suggests that colonoscopy screening reduces CRC mortality by around 70%.\n     Faecal occult blood tests reduce CRC mortality by  maybe 18% and  sigmoidoscopy reduces it by  maybe 27%. A  large-scale randomized trial for colonoscopies started in 2009 and we should produce results soon.\n Anyway, for the sake of discussion, let\u2019s assume colonoscopies are effective and worth the risks. Let\u2019s also assume that you don\u2019t like drinking oral laxatives and having a doctor run a camera up your butt so, like  31% of Americans aged 50-75, you don\u2019t get screenings. What\u2019s the solution?\n I don\u2019t think there is one. You just have to force yourself to do it.\n Lesson: Sometimes the paths can\u2019t be changed. Colonoscopies are non-fun and can\u2019t be made fun, but they are more effective than the alternatives and that\u2019s that.\n   An appealing option is to  pave the path or accept that you won\u2019t do things the \u201cright\u201d way and make what you\u2019re already doing better. Similarly, you can  improve the intended path or make it easier to do things the right way. Sometimes these are hard to distinguish.\n A less attractive option is to  block the path. It\u2019s not necessary to put up a hard wall\u2014all you need to do is make the \u201cwrong\u201d way of doing things nearly as annoying as the \u201cright\u201d way. You can think of this as an equation like\n  And sometimes, sadly, you can\u2019t change the paths. The wrong option will always be there calling to you and you just have to ignore it.\n  [Credit: I joined Team Coat Rack after reading  this essay by Rob Wiblin.
