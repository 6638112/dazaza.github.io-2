His brilliant contributions to science—such as the famous exclusion principle that would eventually earn him a Nobel Prize—had cemented his reputation as a genius. Remarkably, it demonstrated, among other consequences, why the electrons in an atom don’t all cluster together in the lowest energy quantum state and render it unstable. He had also predicted the existence of a lightweight, electrically neutral particle—later dubbed the neutrino—that, while yet to be found experimentally, already offered a way forward in understanding a radiative process called beta decay.</p><p>到1930年底，出生于奥地利的理论物理学家沃尔夫冈·保利（Wolfgang Pauli）达到了顶峰，但那绝对是一种情感上的破坏。他对科学的杰出贡献（例如著名的排他原则最终使他获得了诺贝尔奖），巩固了他作为天才的声誉。值得注意的是，它证明了，除其他后果外，原子中的电子为什么没有全部以最低能量的量子态聚集在一起并使其不稳定。他还预言了轻量化的电中性粒子（后来被称为中微子）的存在，尽管还没有进行实验发现，但它已经为理解称为β衰变的辐射过程提供了前进的道路。</p><p> But while the particle world was starting to shape up nicely, Pauli’s own world was crashing around him. His cascade of troubles began three years earlier, when his beloved mother committed suicide, at the age of only 48, in reaction to his father’s infidelity. Within a year his father remarried, wedding an artist who was in her late 20s—around the same age as Pauli at the time. Pauli derided his father’s decision and nicknamed his father’s new wife “the evil stepmother.”</p><p> 但是当粒子世界开始好转时，保利自己的世界正在他周围崩溃。他的烦恼始于三年前，那年他深爱的母亲因父亲的不忠而自杀，当时年仅48岁。在不到一年的时间里，他的父亲重婚，嫁给了一位20多岁的艺术家-当时与Pauli年龄相同。保利嘲笑父亲的决定，并昵称其父亲的新妻子为“邪恶的继母”。</p><p>  By then, while Pauli’s career was boosted by being appointed to a professorship at the ETH [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology] in Zurich, he had become increasingly disillusioned. For reasons not entirely understood, in May 1929 he abandoned the religion of his birth, Catholicism, by formally leaving the Church. Pauli traveled often to Berlin, where Einstein, Schrödinger, Planck (then emeritus, but still active), and other luminaries made it one of the major hubs of theoretical physics. During one of his visits to that city he met the cabaret dancer Käthe Deppner and began dating her. She had another boyfriend at the time, a chemist, but was open to Pauli’s interest. ﻿He proposed marriage to her, which for some reason she accepted, despite his being far from the man of her dreams. They wed in December 1929.</p><p>  到那时，保利的职业生涯被任命为苏黎世联邦理工学院（瑞士联邦理工学院）的教授职位而得到提振，但他的幻想却越来越幻灭了。由于尚未完全理解的原因，他于1929年5月正式离开教堂，放弃了自己出生的宗教天主教。保利经常去柏林，在那里爱因斯坦，薛定er，普朗克（当时是名誉，但仍然活跃），以及其他杰出人物使之成为理论物理学的主要枢纽之一。在他去那个城市的一次访问中，他遇到了歌舞表演者KätheDeppner，并开始与她约会。她当时有另一个男朋友，一名化学家，但对Pauli感兴趣。他向她求婚，尽管他离梦想中的男人很远，但由于某种原因，她接受了她。他们于1929年12月结婚。</p><p> ﻿It was a troubled marriage from the start. Her interest in the chemist had not waned and she continued to see him. After a few weeks, she essentially ignored her husband. Pauli spent most of the next year in Zurich; she remained in Berlin. By November 1930 they were divorced. To Pauli’s chagrin, she ended up with the chemist. “Had she taken a bullfighter, I would have understood, but such an ordinary chemist …” he bemoaned.</p><p> 从一开始，这是一场陷入困境的婚姻。她对化学家的兴趣没有减弱，她继续见到他。几个星期后，她基本上不理her丈夫。宝莉（Pauli）明年的大部分时间都在苏黎世度过；她留在柏林。到1930年11月，他们离婚了。保利（Pauli）十分恼火，她最终选择了化学家。 “我会理解，如果她带了一名斗牛士，但有这样一位普通的化学家……”他哀叹道。</p><p> With his emotional life in shambles, Pauli took up drinking and smoking heavily. He became a familiar presence at Mary’s Old Timers Bar, a Zurich tavern styled after American speakeasies. It is remarkable that his neutrino idea had emerged around the same time. He was focused enough to remain productive even with his life in crisis. Pauli’s father decided to intervene, suggesting that he seek out Carl Jung for therapy.</p><p> 鲍里（Pauli）的情感生活一团糟，大量饮酒和吸烟。他在苏黎世的小酒馆玛丽（Mary’s）的Old Timers Bar成为熟悉的人物，这家小酒馆是按照美国的演讲风格设计的。值得注意的是，他的中微子想法是在大约同一时间出现的。即使生活处于危机中，他也足够专注以保持生产力。保利的父亲决定介入，建议他寻找卡尔·荣格进行治疗。</p><p>  Pauli was familiar with Jung’s work, as he spoke often at the ETH. Agreeing to his father’s suggestion, Pauli contacted Jung and made an appointment. By that point, he was desperate to get his inner life back on track and hoped that therapy might make a difference. Pauli expected to be treated by the founder of analytical psychology himself, but Jung assigned him to his young assistant, Erna Rosenbaum. Jung explained that given Pauli’s issues with women he might best be analyzed at first by a female therapist. Her role was to write down Pauli’s dreams until he was confident enough to jot them down himself.</p><p>  保利（Pauli）在ETH上经常讲话时，就很熟悉Jung的工作。保利同意父亲的建议，因此与荣格（Jung）取得了联系，并进行了约会。到那时，他迫切希望自己的内心生活重回正轨，并希望治疗能有所作为。保利原本希望由分析心理学的创始人来对待，但荣格将他指派给他的年轻助手欧娜·罗森鲍姆（Erna Rosenbaum）。荣格（Jung）解释说，鉴于宝莉（Pauli）与女性之间的问题，最好首先由一名女性治疗师来分析。她的角色是写下Pauli的梦想，直到他有足够的信心将自己写下来。</p><p> Rosenbaum’s treatment of Pauli began in February 1932 and lasted about five months. Then, Pauli was placed in the driver’s seat, noting his own dreams for about three months in a kind of self-analysis. Finally, Jung took over personally as his therapist for the following two years. Once Jung started treating Pauli directly, he already had more than 300 recorded dreams to analyze, greatly aiding him in shaping his therapeutic suggestions. In addition to sharing his dreams, Pauli opened up about his emotional turmoil, erratic behavior, alcohol dependency, and issues dealing with women.</p><p> 罗森鲍姆（Rosenbaum）对保利（Pauli）的治疗始于1932年2月，持续了大约五个月。然后，保利被放到了驾驶座上，通过一种自我分析注意到了自己三个月的梦想。最终，荣格在接下来的两年中亲自担任治疗师。荣格（Jung）直接开始治疗保利（Pauli）后，已经有300多个记录下来的梦可供分析，极大地帮助了他制定治疗建议。除分享自己的梦想外，Pauli还公开谈论了自己的情感动荡，行为不稳定，酗酒以及与女性打交道的问题。</p><p> For Jung’s studies of the impact of the collective unconscious on the psyche, including the roles of dreams and fantasies, he sought out subjects with vivid recall. His developing notion of synchronicity, based as it was on dynamic Einsteinian notions of space and time, could certainly benefit from a physicist’s voice. A prominent quantum physicist, who happened to have ﻿complex dreams he could remember with ease, was an extraordinary find.</p><p>在荣格研究集体无意识对心理的影响（包括梦想和幻想的作用）时，他寻找了具有生动回忆性的主题。他不断发展的“同步性”概念基于爱因斯坦关于时空的动态概念，当然可以从物理学家的声音中受益。一位杰出的量子物理学家，恰好有一个他能轻松记住的复杂梦想，是一个非凡的发现。</p><p> There is just something obviously reasonable about the following notion: If all life is built from atoms that obey precise equations we know—which seems to be true—then the existence of life might just be some downstream consequence of these laws...  READ MORE</p><p> 以下概念显然很合理：如果所有生命都是由遵循精确方程的原子建立的，那似乎是事实，那么生命的存在可能只是这些定律的下游结果。阅读更多</p><p> Ultimately, either directly or indirectly, Jung compiled roughly 1,300 of Pauli’s dreams and would make use of them (while maintaining patient confidentiality) for his research studies. Consequently, as the scholar Beverley Zabriskie wryly points out, “Readers of … Jung are more familiar with Wolfgang Pauli’s unconscious than with his waking life and achievement.” It is a mystery how Pauli remembered so many dreams in such great detail. Truly, his recall was phenomenal, and he must have trained himself in some manner. The dreams added immensely to the resources Jung could draw upon in crafting his theories.</p><p> 最终，无论是直接还是间接地，荣格都完成了Pauli梦中的约1300个梦，并将在梦research以求的过程中利用它们（同时保持患者的机密性）。因此，正如学者贝弗利·扎布里斯基（Beverley Zabriskie）苦苦指出的那样：“……荣格的读者更熟悉沃尔夫冈·波利的无意识，而不是醒着的生活和成就。”保利如此详细地记住了许多梦想，这是一个谜。确实，他的回忆是惊人的，而且他必须以某种方式训练自己。梦想极大地增加了荣格在制定其理论时可以利用的资源。</p><p> But of course, it wasn’t just a research project. Jung genuinely wanted to help Pauli become more aware of his stifled feelings. The gist of Jung’s treatment was to show Pauli how his emotional self, symbolized by the anima archetype, was repressed in favor of pure intellect. Pauli came to understand how his life was imbalanced. Gradually, over two years of therapy, he would become more settled—at least for a time. Finally able to maintain a mature relationship, in 1934 he married Franciska “Franca” Bertram in London. Around the same time, he decided to end his private therapy sessions. He was feeling more stable and had cut back—at least temporarily—on his drinking.</p><p> 当然，这不只是一个研究项目。荣格（Jung）真正地想帮助保利（Pauli）更加了解自己的窒息感。荣格（Jung）治疗的要旨是向宝莉（Pauli）展示如何以动画原型来象征他的情感自我，以纯粹的智力为重。保利开始了解他的生活是如何失衡的。逐渐地，经过两年的治疗，他至少在一段时间内会变得更加安定。终于能够维持成熟的关系，他于1934年与伦敦的Franciska“ Franca” Bertram结婚。大约在同一时间，他决定结束私人治疗。他感觉更加稳定，并且（至少暂时）减少了饮酒。</p><p>  Though no longer a patient, Pauli would keep up his correspondence with Jung until almost the end of his life, including sharing his dreams. They’d continue to speculate together about their significance and connections to archetypes. With a brilliant mathematical mind engaged in unraveling the deepest questions in theoretical physics, it is not surprising that many of Pauli’s dreams had geometric elements and abstract symbols. They’d often include symmetric ﻿arrangements of circles and lines, which Jung would interpret in light of his notion of archetypes. As mathematical physics fed Pauli’s visions, which Jung connected with ancient symbolism, the two thinkers ended up weaving profound metaphorical connections between the two realms.</p><p>  保利不再是病人，但他会继续与荣格保持往来，直到他生命的尽头，包括分享他的梦想。他们将继续就其重要性以及与原型的联系进行推测。凭着精湛的数学头脑来解开理论物理学中最深层的问题，Pauli的许多梦想都具有几何元素和抽象符号也就不足为奇了。它们通常包括圆形和直线的对称排列，荣格会根据他的原型概念进行解释。当数学物理学满足了荣格与古代象征主义联系在一起的保利的视野时，两位思想家最终在两个领域之间编织了深刻的隐喻联系。</p><p> Pauli wrote to Jung reporting a dream he had about a physics congress with many participants. The dream had numerous images representing physical examples of polarization (separation of one thing into two opposites), including electric dipoles (balanced arrangements of positive and negative charges) and the splitting of atomic spectral lines within an applied magnetic field. Jung responded the dream symbolism likely represented “the complementary relationship in a self-regulating system [including] man and woman.”</p><p> 保利（Pauli）写信给荣格（Jung），报告他梦about以求的是与许多参与者进行物理大会。梦中有许多图像代表极化的物理实例（将一物分离为两个相反的物体），包括电偶极子（正负电荷的平衡排列）以及施加的磁场内原子光谱线的分裂。荣格（Jung）回应，梦中的象征主义可能代表了“自我调节系统（包括男人和女人）中的互补关系”。</p><p> A saying attributed to Freud is that “sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.” As a physicist, wouldn’t Pauli naturally sometimes have dreams with physics-related content? Couldn’t it be that “sometimes a dipole is just a dipole,” not a symbolic union of man and woman? Jung, like Freud, recognized that possibility and was generally careful not to be dogmatic in his conclusions.</p><p> 弗洛伊德（Freud）的一句话是：“有时雪茄只是雪茄。”作为物理学家，保利有时会自然而然地梦想着与物理学相关的内容吗？难道不是“偶极子有时只是偶极子”，而不是男人和女人的象征性结合吗？荣格和弗洛伊德一样，也认识到了这种可能性，因此通常谨慎地对待自己的结论。</p><p> Another of Pauli’s dreams included an ancient symbol called the Ouroboros: a serpent devouring its own tail while coiled into a circle. Such symbolism, related to the yin-yang icon of Taoism, reflects the concept of eternal destruction and rebirth, including the turning of the seasons and the recycling of the natural elements. Such a figure also displays the rotational symmetry that Pauli and others employed in their explorations of quantum properties. Drawing from a term in Eastern philosophy, it also forms a rudimentary kind of mandala.</p><p>保利的另一个梦想包括一个古老的象征，称为“衔尾蛇”：一条蛇吞噬自己的尾巴，同时盘绕成一个圆圈。这种象征主义与道家的阴阳图标有关，反映了永恒的毁灭和重生的概念，包括季节的转变和自然元素的循环利用。这样的图还显示了Pauli和其他人在探索量子性质时所采用的旋转对称性。借鉴东方哲学的术语，它也构成了基本的曼荼罗。</p><p>  ﻿One of the remarkable aspects of the Pauli–Jung collaboration was how their rhetoric had begun to converge. Thanks to Pauli, Jung had become far more knowledgeable about quantum physics, including its chance aspects and the role of observers. Thanks to Jung, Pauli had become immersed in the studies of mysticism, numerology, and ancient symbolism.</p><p>  Pauli-Jung合作的显着方面之一是他们的言论开始融合。多亏保利（Pauli），荣格（Jung）对量子物理学有了更多的了解，包括其偶然性方面以及观察者的作用。由于荣格，保利开始沉迷于神秘主义，命理学和古代象征主义的研究。</p><p> Around that time, Jung began to hone his notion of synchronicity in preparation for developing a treatise on the subject. With the help of Pauli, he hoped to shape it into a key principle acknowledged by the psychological community. As part of that goal, he aspired to develop his own emblem—a quaternio—as shorthand for how nature is connected. Jung would schedule a two-part series of talks on the subject. In preparation for the lectures, in 1950, he sent Pauli a letter that included a quaternio diagram that juxtaposed causality with correspondentia (a term referring to acausal connections analogous to the Hermetic law of correspondence) and space with time. It looked like:</p><p> 大约在那个时候，荣格开始磨练他的同步性概念，以准备就该主题撰写论文。在Pauli的帮助下，他希望将其塑造成心理学界认可的关键原则。作为该目标的一部分，他渴望发展自己的象征-quaternio-作为自然与人的联系的简写。荣格将安排一个分为两部分的系列讲座。在为演讲做准备时，他在1950年给Pauli写了一封信，其中包括一个四元图，该四元图将因果关系与对应关系（该术语指的是因果联系，类似于对应的函密律）并随时间间隔。它看起来像：</p><p>  On Nov. 24, 1950, after having a chance to think about Jung’s diagram, Pauli responded with a critique about his division of space and time into opposites. Einstein’s revolution, Pauli pointed out, merged space and time into a single entity—space-time—not opposites. Instead, he suggested a modified diagram (which Jung accepted with slight further modifications):</p><p>  1950年11月24日，在有机会考虑荣格的图表后，保利以批评的方式回应了他对时空的划分。保利指出，爱因斯坦的革命将时空融合为一个实体，即时空，而不是对立。相反，他提出了一个修改后的图表（Jung接受了进一步的修改）：</p><p>  Pauli’s contrast of energy (and momentum) with space-time matched the dichotomy posed by the relativistic version of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. The more that is known about space-time, the less that is known about energy-momentum (similarly a four-dimensional entity in relativity), and the converse.</p><p>  保利将能量（和动量）与时空的对比与海森堡不确定性原理的相对论版本所造成的二分法相吻合。对时空的了解越多，对能量动量（类似于相对论中的四维实体）的了解就越少，反之亦然。</p><p> Pauli’s concept of causality, called “statistical causality,” which Jung came to adopt as well, was distinct from mechanistic models. He argued that given the random outcomes in certain kinds of individual quantum measurements, such as determining whether or not a radioactive sample has exhibited a single decay within a certain time frame, the law of cause and effect needed to include the notions of chance and averaging.</p><p> 荣格也采用了保利的因果关系概念，即“统计因果关系”，它不同于机械模型。他认为，鉴于某些种类的单个量子测量的随机结果，例如确定放射性样品在一定时间范围内是否表现出单一衰变，因果定律需要包括机会和平均值的概念。</p><p> The results of experiments are predictable only once the researchers take averages over many trials. In the same letter, Pauli connected synchronicity with parapsychologist J.B. Rhine’s mind-reading research: “As you yourself say, your work stands and falls with the Rhine experiments. I, too, am of the view that the empirical work behind the experiments is well-founded.”</p><p> 实验结果只有在研究人员对许多试验取平均值后才能预测。在同一封信中，Pauli将同步性与超心理学家J.B. Rhine的心智研究联系在一起：“正如您自己所说，您的工作在莱茵河实验中成败。我也认为，实验背后的经验工作是有充分根据的。”</p><p> Enthusiastic about Pauli’s suggestions, Jung responded with the bold proposal of generalizing synchronicity to include acausal relationships without a mental component—that is, purely physical interactions. He did not specify quantum entanglement, but surely that fell into Jung’s expanded definition.</p><p>对保利的建议很热心，荣格回应了大胆的建议：将共时性概括为包括没有心理成分的纯粹因果关系，即纯​​粹的身体互动。他没有具体说明量子纠缠，但可以肯定的是，这属于荣格的扩展定义。</p><p>  Ironically, his generalization served to decouple the concept of synchronicity from the Rhine results, precisely at the same time he and Pauli were embracing them. A broad definition of synchronicity as any acausal connecting principle encourages exploration of how the universe is intertwined through symmetry and additional mechanisms other than the chain of cause and effect. With some reservations, Pauli saw merit in Jung’s expanded definition. Any extension to physical processes, he emphasized, needs to move beyond psychological terms, such as archetypes, that would not be appropriate.</p><p>  具有讽刺意味的是，他的概括使同步性的概念与莱茵河的结果脱钩，正好在他和保利拥抱它们的同时。同步性的广泛定义是任何因果关系的原理，它鼓励探索通过对称性和因果链以外的其他机制来使宇宙相互缠绕。保利保留了一些保留意见，认为荣格的扩展定义值得。他强调，对身体过程的任何扩展都需要超越心理上的条件，例如原型，这是不合适的。</p><p> He wrote to Jung on Dec. 12, 1950: “[T]he more general question seems to be the one about the different types of holistic, acausal forms of orderedness in nature and the conditions surrounding their occurrence. This can either be spontaneous or ‘induced’—i.e., the result of an experiment devised and conducted by human beings.”</p><p> 他在1950年12月12日给荣格（Jung）的信中说：“更普遍的问题似乎是关于自然界中各种不同类型的整体，非自然的有序性及其发生条件的问题。这可以是自发的，也可以是“诱发的”，即由人类设计和执行的实验的结果。”</p><p> In 1952, as the culmination of their collaboration, Jung and Pauli published a joint volume,  Naturerklärung und Psyche (The Interpretation of Nature and the Psyche). It included two treatises, “Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle,” by Jung, and “The Influence of Archetypal Ideas on the Scientific Ideas of Kepler.” Their combined work effectively outed (for anyone who read it closely) Pauli as the source of Jung’s dream material. Decades later, the first part (Jung’s section) would be released as a popular paperback. It contained Jung’s famous anecdote of the scarab, as an example of the “meaningful coincidence” he associated with synchronicity:</p><p> 1952年，作为他们合作的最高潮，荣格和保利（Jung and Pauli）联合出版了《自然与心理学》（Naturerklärungund Psyche）一书。它包括两篇论着，荣格（Jung）的“同步性：一种非理性的联系原理”和“原型思想对开普勒科学思想的影响”。他们的综合作品有效地淘汰了Pauli，这是荣格梦material以求的作品的来源（对于那些仔细阅读的人来说）。几十年后，第一部分（Jung的部分）将作为流行的平装书发行。它包含了荣格著名的圣甲虫轶事，以他与同步性相关的“有意义的巧合”为例：</p><p> A young woman I was treating had, at a critical moment, a dream in which she was given a golden scarab. While she was telling me this dream, I sat with my back to the closed window. Suddenly I heard a noise behind me, like a gentle tapping. I turned round and saw a flying insect knocking against the window-pane from the outside. I opened the window and caught the creature in the air as it flew in. It was the nearest analogy to a golden scarab one finds in our latitudes, a scarabaeid beetle …</p><p> 我正在治疗的一个年轻妇女在关键时刻做了一个梦，她被赋予了金色的圣甲虫。当她告诉我这个梦时，我背对着关闭的窗户坐着。突然，我听到身后传来一阵噪音，像是轻拍。我转过身，看到一只飞虫从外面撞向窗玻璃。我打开窗户，把那只飞来飞去的生物捉住了。这与我们在纬度中发现的金甲虫最接近的比喻是甲虫。</p><p> For scientific minds, such anecdotal evidence did not help Jung make his case. Any psychotherapist who has analyzed thousands of dreams by various patients would be bound by simple chance to note coincidences at some point between elements in dreams and common events in real life, such as encounters with insects. Indeed, Jung freely acknowledged that there were alternative explanations for each of the stories he told—he just wanted his readers to note a pattern. Greater emphasis on his generalized definition of synchronicity, which encompassed physical acausal connections (such as entanglement and symmetry relationships) would have made a stronger argument for the need to move beyond pure causality.</p><p> 对于科学人来说，这样的轶事证据并没有帮助荣格提出自己的论据。任何分析过各种患者成千上万个梦的心理治疗师，都将获得一次简单的机会，即注意到梦中的元素与现实生活中的常见事件（例如与昆虫的相遇）之间某些巧合之处。的确，荣格（Jung）自由地承认，他讲的每个故事都有其他解释-他只是想让读者注意一个模式。更加强调他对同步性的广义定义，其中包括物理上的非因果联系（例如纠缠和对称关系），将使人们有必要提出超越纯粹因果关系的论点。</p><p> But as it stood, Jung’s combination of incidents, dreams, and mythology won over few scientific adherents, aside from Pauli. One review of the book, written anonymously by an eminent mathematician, concluded: “After thoroughly studying their writings for many months now, I have come to see clearly that they are both utterly mad.”</p><p> 但就目前而言，除了保利（Pauli）之外，荣格（Jung）的各种事件，梦想和神话相结合赢得了少数科学信徒。著名数学家匿名撰写的这本书的一篇评论得出的结论是：“经过几个月的彻底研究，我才清楚地看到他们都疯了。”</p><p>  In August 1957, Pauli and Jung exchanged the final letters in their lengthy correspondence. Pauli’s note to Jung that month was one of his longest, including a long description of a dream and exposition about symmetries in physics. Jung responded with great interest to Pauli’s letter, interpreting the dream Pauli mentioned as symbolic of the reconciliation of opposites, such as psyche and body. Jung suggests that parity symmetry violation in the weak interaction is analogous to an arbiter—called the “Third”— taking sides between two otherwise symmetrically opposite entities. The Third might slightly favor psyche over body, breaking the symmetry between them. The rest of Jung’s note delved into his new interest in UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects), which he had concluded are either real (from space) or a new kind of mythology with its own archetypes.</p><p>1957年8月，保利和荣格用冗长的信件交换了最后一封信。保利在那个月给荣格（Jung）的笔记是他最长的笔记​​之一，其中包括对梦的长篇描述以及关于物理对称性的论述。荣格对宝莉的来信非常感兴趣，将宝莉提到的梦想解释为象征对立的象征，例如心灵与身体的和解。荣格（Jung）提出，在弱互动中违反奇偶对称性类似于仲裁人（称为“第三者”），在两个原本对称的相对实体之间占据一席之地。第三者可能稍微偏爱心理而非身体，从而打破了两者之间的对称性。荣格的其余笔记深入研究了他对UFO（不明飞行物）的新兴趣，他得出的结论是（来自太空）是真实的，还是具有自身原型的新型神话。</p><p> Why did Pauli and Jung’s lengthy correspondence end with that exchange of letters, even though Pauli lived for more than a year longer? A gap of months or even years sometimes happens even in the letter-writing of good friends. Moreover, as we’ve seen in his attitude toward other physicists, Pauli was in his heart a skeptic. He critically examined any dogma, including Jung’s. He complained to Bohr, for instance, about some of the vagaries of Jung’s approach: “The Jung school is more broad minded than Freud has been, but correspondingly less clear. Most unsatisfactory seems to me the emotional and vague use of the concept of ‘Psyche’ by Jung, which is not even logically self-consistent.” Pauli also began to cast doubt on Rhine’s methods. In a letter to Rhine, dated Feb. 25, 1957, but received only after his death, Pauli asked Rhine about an article he had heard about that was critical of parapsychology. Rattled by the letter, Rhine complained to Jung, who tried to track down the critical piece but found no evidence of its existence.</p><p> 保利（Pauli）和荣格（Jung）住了一年以上，为什么他们的信件往来以这种交换来结束？即使在好朋友的来信中，有时也会出现几个月甚至几年的间隔。而且，正如我们从他对其他物理学家的态度中所看到的那样，保利在他心中是一个怀疑者。他严格审查了任何教条，包括荣格。例如，他向玻尔（Bohr）抱怨荣格（Jung）的做法有些变幻：“荣格学校的思想比弗洛伊德（Freud）更为广泛，但相应地也不太清楚。在我看来，最令人不满意的是荣格（Jung）对“心理”（Psyche）概念的情感性和模糊性使用，这在逻辑上甚至不是自洽的。”保利还开始对莱茵河的方法产生怀疑。在1957年2月25日给莱茵河的一封信中，但保利去世后才收到一封信，他询问莱茵河关于他听说过的一篇批评超心理学的文章。莱茵河在信中发出嘎嘎叫声，向荣格抱怨，荣格试图追查关键部分，但没有发现它存在的证据。</p><p> Further impetus for Pauli to disassociate from Jung was the latter’s obsession with UFOs. Pauli was curious about that question, but not enough to devote the time to it for which Jung might have hoped. That period corresponded to a major collaboration on unified field theory Pauli conducted with Heisenberg. Additionally, Pauli’s stamina began to decline in his final year before he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Thus a host of factors might have led to the end of the long, productive dialogue.</p><p> Pauli与Jung脱离关系的进一步动力是后者对UFO的痴迷。保利（Pauli）对这个问题感到好奇，但还不足以花时间让荣格（Jung）希望如此。那个时期相当于Pauli与Heisenberg在统一领域理论上进行的一次重大合作。此外，保利（Pauli）在被诊断出患有胰腺癌之前的最后一年中的耐力开始下降。因此，许多因素可能导致了漫长而富有成果的对话的结束。</p><p>   Paul Halpern, a professor of physics at the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, is the author of  Synchronicity: The Epic Quest to Understand the Quantum Nature of Cause and Effect.
