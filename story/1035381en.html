So a few months ago I suggested to a friend of mine that they should write about the situations in which they started procrastinating and explained that writing forces you to think about what exactly happened and thus would help with their productivity issues. A couple of weeks later I asked them how did it go and they told me that they did this a couple of times but it wasn’t useful, so they gave up on writing things down. I asked them if I can take a look at a couple of notes that they took and this is when I realized how shitty the advice I gave them was.</p><p>例如，我给人们最多的建议之一就是多写。因此，几个月前，我建议我的一位朋友写下他们开始拖延的情况，并解释说，写作迫使你思考到底发生了什么，从而有助于解决他们的生产率问题。几周后，我问他们进展如何，他们告诉我，他们这样做了几次，但没有用，所以他们放弃了写东西。我问他们我能不能看看他们做的几个笔记，就在这时我意识到我给他们的建议是多么糟糕。</p><p>  wrote down a literal description of the incident that happened with what the events that preceded it</p><p>写下对发生的事件的字面描述，以及之前发生的事件。</p><p>   Here’s what I do when I notice that I have a pattern of behavior I don’t like and what I was trying to communicate:</p><p>当我注意到我有一种我不喜欢的行为模式，以及我想要传达的东西时，我会这么做：</p><p> open an incoming.md file in which I write down any notes for further processing having just one file decreases friction of writing thoughts down massively and makes me much more likely to write notes</p><p>打开一个incoming.md文件，我可以在其中写下任何笔记以便进一步处理。只有一个文件可以减少大量记录想法的摩擦，使我更有可能写笔记。</p><p>   open my todo program ( Amazing Marvin) and add a task that roughly says “did i do the specific action i was planning to take” a week into the future (this task can then be re-scheduled into the future any number of times as a reminder) any time I encounter this reminder, I write down any new thoughts on the issue to incoming.md</p><p>打开我的待办事项程序(AmazingMarvin)，添加一个任务，粗略地写着一周后“我是否做了我计划采取的具体行动”(这个任务可以被重新安排到未来任意次数作为提醒)，每当我遇到这个提醒时，我都会写下关于这个问题的任何新想法。md。</p><p> clean up incoming.md every Sunday by deleting/moving into Roam Research all notes older than 1 month, so after 1 month I return to the initial note I took and, in case I did not solve the problem completely, IN A SEPARATE NOTE I summarize whatever happened to the problem in the meantime, what I did, what I’m going to do in the future thus I will return to that new note 1 month later again and see what happened</p><p>清理incoming.md每周日，删除/移动到roam Research中超过1个月的所有笔记，因此在1个月后我会返回到我记录的最初笔记，如果我没有完全解决问题，我会在另一个笔记中总结在此期间问题发生了什么，我做了什么，我将来要做什么，因此我将在1个月后再次返回到那个新笔记，看看发生了什么。</p><p> returning to every note 1 month later enables gradual thinking and tinkering with habits and thought processes and often leads to new thoughts or insights, while also naturally integrating spaced repetition and increasing retention of ideas</p><p>一个月后重新阅读每个笔记可以逐步思考，调整习惯和思维过程，通常会产生新的想法或洞察力，同时自然地整合间隔重复，增加对想法的记忆。</p><p> this also effectively allows me to write letters to myself 1 month into the future, which is often very helpful</p><p>这也有效地让我在一个月后给自己写信，这通常是非常有帮助的。</p><p> move off old notes to Roam Research and tag them and occasionally check older notes with the tags in question to see long-term progress</p><p>将旧笔记移开以漫游研究并标记它们，偶尔用有问题的标签检查较旧的笔记，以查看长期进展。</p><p>  it’s extremely difficult to communicate the process above verbally in a casual conversation where you have like 30 seconds of talking time before people start feeling weird and where you’re limited by the working memory of your friend</p><p>在一次随意的交谈中，在人们开始感到奇怪之前，你有大约30秒的交谈时间，而且你受到朋友工作记忆的限制，在这种情况下，用口头交流上述过程是极其困难的。</p><p> it’s extremely easy to mentally collapse the process above into something like “have you tried writing cases when you start procrastinating down?” and forget about all of the other elements of this strategy that actually make it useful</p><p>你很容易在心理上把上面的过程压缩成这样的东西：“当你开始拖延的时候，你有没有试过写案例？”忘掉这一策略的所有其他元素，这些元素实际上会让它变得有用。</p><p> I  actually do all of the steps above because I’m insane and obsessed with this stuff and simply “write down the situation” does not facilitate the emotional connection needed for this habit to stay in place</p><p>我实际上做了上面所有的步骤，因为我疯了，痴迷于这些东西，简单地“写下情况”并不能促进保持这种习惯所需的情感联系。</p><p>  People differ a lot in their levels of conscientiousness, extraversion, energy, ambition, curiosity, independence, risk-seeking, fame-seeking, neuroticism, conflict-aversion, obsessiveness, etc.  By default, high conscientiousness people don’t understand low conscientiousness people. High extraversion people don’t understand low extraversion people. High energy people don’t understand low energy people. It’s actually worse than that because “high neuroticism” or  “high ambition” can actually mean a ton of different things. ( a)</p><p>人们在尽责、外向、精力、野心、好奇心、独立性、冒险、追名逐利、神经质、厌恶冲突、强迫症等方面的水平差异很大。默认情况下，高度尽责的人不理解低度尽责的人。高外向的人不理解低外向的人。精力充沛的人不了解低精力充沛的人。实际上情况比这更糟，因为“高度神经质”或“雄心壮志”实际上意味着很多不同的东西。(A)。</p><p> Even if someone shares our thinking style (so we feel like we have good rapport and understand each other well), they probably differ from us in a lot of other crucial personality aspects and thus are unlikely to understand our attitude towards life  by default. Everyone (including me) tends to really underestimate how different we all are.</p><p>即使有人和我们有相同的思维方式(所以我们觉得我们很融洽，很好地理解了对方)，但他们很可能在许多其他重要的人格方面与我们不同，因此不太可能默认理解我们对生活的态度。每个人(包括我)都倾向于低估我们有多么不同。</p><p> I probably have ADHD, I’m not good at doing what other people tell me to do and I want to work directly on problems I care about the most. This doesn’t prevent my grandmas who’ve known me for my entire life and who spent thousands of hours with me over the years to keep telling me that I should just get a normal job. Even our closest ones have surprisingly little insight into our mental states.</p><p>我可能患有多动症，我不擅长做别人让我做的事情，我想直接解决我最关心的问题。这并不能阻止我的祖母，他们认识我一辈子，多年来花了数千个小时陪我，一直告诉我应该找一份正常的工作。令人惊讶的是，即使是我们最亲近的人也对我们的精神状态知之甚少。</p><p> Note the “by default&#34;s above. If you only have 3 minutes of conversation time, you will probably only be able to hear the default advice, either modeled on the person who’s giving the advice themself or on a very crude model of you. But if you have an actual conversation or you know each other really well, it’s quite likely that you’ll be able to articulate your thought processes much better, to figure out what exactly makes you click, and will get advice that is actually tailored to you.  It’s ok to take an hour or more to discuss a difficult decision with a friend.</p><p>请注意上面的“默认设置”。如果你只有3分钟的谈话时间，你可能只能听到默认的建议，要么模仿给自己提建议的人，要么模仿非常粗糙的你。但如果你们进行了一次真正的交谈，或者你们彼此非常了解，很有可能你们会更好地表达自己的思维过程，弄清楚到底是什么让你点击，并得到真正为你量身定做的建议。花一个小时或更多的时间和朋友讨论一个艰难的决定是可以的。</p><p>  make sure that the person cares about solving the problem in the first place (rather than just venting, feeling obliged to want to solve the problem…)</p><p>确保这个人首先关心解决问题(而不是仅仅发泄，觉得有义务想要解决问题…)。</p><p> make sure that the person does not have psychological blocks around doing anything about the problem (anxiety, learned helplessness) or figure out how to work around them</p><p>确保这个人在做任何事情(焦虑、习得性无助)时没有心理障碍，也没有想出如何解决这些问题。</p><p> make sure that the person’s internal traits and ambitions match the thing you’re suggesting</p><p>确保这个人的内在特征和抱负符合你的建议。</p><p>  Of course you’re not guaranteed to get good advice in any case. A risk-loving CEO will probably not tell you that the reasons behind them burning cash launching new products are boredom and the desire for novelty. And a risk-averse CEO will probably not tell you that the reason they’re not launching new unproven products while allowing themselves to be eaten by startups is because they’re afraid of failure.</p><p>当然，不能保证你在任何情况下都能得到好的建议。喜欢冒险的CEO可能不会告诉你，他们烧钱推出新产品背后的原因是无聊和对新奇的渴望。厌恶风险的CEO可能不会告诉你，他们之所以不推出未经验证的新产品，却任由自己被初创公司吃掉，是因为他们害怕失败。</p><p> Correspondingly, the former CEO and the latter CEO will probably give you different advice on important life decisions, each backing up their advice with very seriously-sounding reasons. And even if the do realize that they’re risk-seeking or risk-averse, the former has probably convinced themself that people lose by being too cautious while the latter has probably convinced themself that people lose by being too reckless and will give you advice corresponding with their life philosophy, probably not realizing and thus not telling you how they arrived at this conclusion that informs every aspect of their thinking. All of this is especially true for “taboo” topics. Nobody wants to be considered reckless and nobody wants to be considered a chicken, meaning that people will be especially self-deceptive in such domains.</p><p>相应地，前CEO和后CEO可能会在重要的人生决定上给你不同的建议，每个人都会用听起来非常严肃的理由来支持他们的建议。即使他们意识到自己喜欢冒险或厌恶风险，前者很可能让自己相信，人们会因为过于谨慎而失败，而后者可能会让自己相信，人们会因为过于鲁莽而失败，并会给你提供与他们的人生哲学相对应的建议，很可能没有意识到，因此也不会告诉你他们是如何得出这个影响他们思维方方面面的结论的。对于“禁忌”话题来说，这一切都是如此。没有人想被认为鲁莽，也没有人想被认为是胆小鬼，这意味着人们在这些领域会特别自欺欺人。</p><p> People are systematically wrong not just about their fundamental traits but also about everyday desires and emotions. Parents who “want the best” for their children but actually just live  their own failed ambitions ( a) through them is one classic example.    ‘When John F. Kennedy was asked about the level of involvement and influence that his father had held in his razor-thin presidential victory over Richard Nixon, he would joke that on the eve of the election his father had asked him the exact number of votes he would need to win: There was no way he was paying “for a landslide”.&#39; ( a)  People bad at small talk deciding that small talk is useless is also a good one.</p><p>人们不仅在他们的基本特征上，而且在日常欲望和情感上都是系统性的错误。父母“希望孩子得到最好的”，但实际上只是通过他们实现了自己失败的抱负(A)，这就是一个典型的例子。“当约翰·F·肯尼迪(John F.Kennedy)被问及他父亲在他击败理查德·尼克松(Richard Nixon)总统时的参与程度和影响力时，他会开玩笑说，在大选前夕，他父亲问他需要多少选票才能赢得胜利：他不可能为‘压倒性胜利’买单。(A)那些不擅长闲聊的人认为闲聊没用也是个不错的选择。”</p><p> To summarize: people generate systematically wrong explanations for their behavior and they will give you systematically bad advice if they reason from wrong explanations from their behavior. If you pay attention, you will notice this everywhere. We are really good at self-deception.</p><p>总而言之：人们会系统性地对他们的行为做出错误的解释，如果他们从自己的行为中得出错误的解释，他们会给你系统性的糟糕建议。如果你留心，你会发现这一点无处不在。我们真的很会自欺欺人。</p><p>     When things go bad, we try to fix them, but the truth is quite often things return to normal all on their own or due to external factors but to feel that our actions made them better.</p><p>当事情变得糟糕时，我们会试图修复它们，但事实往往是，事情往往完全靠自己或由于外部因素而恢复正常，但却感觉到我们的行为让它们变得更好。</p><p> For example, I’m writing a post on how to make waking up easier right now. I’ve had giant troubles getting out of bed in the morning for as long as I can remember myself, however I finally managed to start waking up with an alarm consistently a few months ago and figured that ok, I’ve been doing it for a few months, I’m pretty confident in what I’m doing, I think I should write about this – everyone I know has exactly the same problem after all. So I wrote 2,000 words about this over a few weeks and then lost the ability to get out of bed easily. I still don’t know what happened.</p><p>例如，我现在正在写一篇关于如何让醒来变得更容易的帖子。自从我还记得自己以来，每天早上起床都有很大的麻烦，然而几个月前，我终于开始用闹钟不停地醒来，我想，好吧，我已经这么做了几个月，我对自己正在做的事情很有信心，我想我应该写下这件事--毕竟我认识的每个人都有完全相同的问题。所以我在几周的时间里写了2000字，然后就失去了轻松起床的能力。我还是不知道发生了什么事。</p><p> The simpler the problem the person is facing, the more difficult it is to fix</p><p>一个人面临的问题越简单，解决起来就越困难。</p><p> Mistake I’ve made many times: seeing someone with a simple problem and thinking “not to worry, this just needs a quick fix and they’ll be on their way!” instead of “what level of hidden dysfunction is keeping even this simple problem unsolved?”</p><p>我犯过很多次错误：看到某人有一个简单的问题，想着“别担心，这只需要一个快速的解决办法，他们很快就会来的！”而不是“什么程度的隐藏功能障碍让这个简单的问题没有得到解决？”</p><p>   Imagine someone is terrible at email: they take a long time to respond, they read emails and then forget about them until the person on the other end follows up a week later, they can’t send themselves a reminder-email and be sure that they’re actually going to read it, etc.</p><p>想象一下，某人在电子邮件方面很糟糕：他们花了很长时间回复邮件，看了邮件后就忘记了，直到另一端的人一周后才跟进，他们无法给自己发送提醒邮件，并确保他们真的会读到它，等等。</p><p>  they have literally just never heard of “inbox zero” and the “mark as unread” button in Gmail</p><p>他们真的从来没有听说过Gmail中的“收件箱清零”和“标记为未读”按钮。</p><p> they are bad at managing their time in general and they get overwhelmed with email easily; they find it difficult to say no to people and they don’t read/reply to emails as a way to avoid discomfort from having to say no or risk being overwhelmed with commitments; or they’re plain busy and unable to reply to or to even read 100 emails a day</p><p>总的来说，他们不善于管理自己的时间，很容易被电子邮件淹没；他们发现很难对别人说不，他们不会阅读/回复电子邮件，以此来避免不得不说不或冒着被承诺淹没的风险而感到不适；或者他们简直就是忙得不可开交，无法回复甚至一天阅读100封电子邮件。</p><p> It’s  extremely easy to hear about someone struggling to stay on top of their email and go “oh, not being terrible at email seems pretty simple. You just need to open email every morning and make sure you get to inbox 0. That will solve most of your problems.” It’s extremely unlikely that the person you’re talking to literally just never thought about that. Note that all the issues in point (2) are much more difficult to solve than (1).</p><p>我们很容易听到一些人努力控制他们的电子邮件，然后说：“哦，在电子邮件上不是很糟糕似乎很简单。”你只需要每天早上打开电子邮件，并确保你的收件箱是0。这将解决你的大部分问题。“。与你交谈的人不太可能真的没有想过这一点。请注意，第(2)点中的所有问题都比第(1)点更难解决。</p><p> Ditto for “go to the gym” (exercise-induced vomiting?), “spend less time on twitter” (inability to cultivate friends in real life? compulsive avoidance of work?), “leave the job that makes you suicidal” (no savings?  $$$ vesting over the next couple of years?), etc.</p><p>“去健身房”(运动引起的呕吐？)、“在Twitter上花更少的时间”(无法在现实生活中交朋友？)也是如此。强迫逃避工作？)、“离开会让你自杀的工作”(没有积蓄？在接下来的几年里得到$？)等等。</p><p> When someone tells you you should go to the gym, they’re probably not thinking about a million of personal factors that make going to the gym easy for them. Even worse, it’s quite likely that it was actually difficult for them to start going to the gym, but they managed to develop the adaptations necessary for it to be a consistent habit (e.g. “just going” to the gym even when they don’t quite feel like going, short-circuiting potential negative motivation/overthinking spirals - how?), and these habits have now just become parts of who they are, so they’re not thinking about them and are not realizing they were acquired at this specific point in time.</p><p>当有人告诉你应该去健身房时，他们可能没有考虑到让他们去健身房变得容易的一百万个个人因素。更糟糕的是，他们很可能很难开始去健身房，但他们成功地养成了养成持续习惯所需的适应能力(例如，即使他们不太想去健身房，也只是去健身房，短路潜在的负面动机/过度思考--如何？)，而这些习惯现在已经成为他们的一部分，所以他们没有考虑这些习惯，也没有意识到他们是在这个特定的时间点养成的。</p><p> Returning to my discussion of fixing a pattern of behavior I don’t like, there are many moving parts and background processes that are idiosyncratic to my system and to my personality, like me having an incoming.md file that ensures future review of notes, using Amazing Marvin, which enables low friction but extremely persistent endless reminders, actually using Amazing Marvin rather than checking it once a month but ignoring it day-to-day, having special Roam Research pages and tags that make looking up old notes easy, caring about this shit a lot, and probably a bunch more stuff I’m forgetting now.</p><p>回到我关于修复我不喜欢的行为模式的讨论，有很多移动部分和后台进程是我的系统和个性所特有的，比如我有一个incoming.md文件，可以确保将来检查笔记，使用AmazingMarvin，它允许低摩擦但非常持久的无休止提醒，实际上使用AmazingMarvin，而不是每月检查一次，但每天都忽略它，有特殊的漫游研究页面和标签，使得查找旧笔记变得很容易，非常关心这些垃圾笔记，而且很可能还会使用AmazingMarvin，而不是每月检查一次，但每天都忽略它，有特殊的漫游研究页面和标签，使得查找旧笔记变得容易，非常关心这些垃圾笔记，而且很可能。</p><p> Simply grafting it on anyone’s life is unlikely to work and disentangling all of the elements and gradually installing all of them is actually pretty hard because the structure of such systems is typically very path-dependent, driven by personal exploration and working largely because of the emotional attachment developed to it in the process of this exploration. Of course creating such an emotional attachment is possible (one reason why summarizing self-help books that spend 200 pages trying to do this for a single idea is stupid), is worth trying, but it’s not easy to do and you should not be discouraged that it doesn’t work 100% instantaneously.</p><p>简单地把它嫁接到任何人的生活中是不太可能奏效的，解开所有的元素并逐渐安装它们实际上是相当困难的，因为这样的系统的结构通常非常依赖于路径，由个人探索驱动，很大程度上是因为在探索的过程中对它产生了情感依恋。当然，创造这样一种情感依恋是可能的(为一个想法总结200页试图做到这一点的自助书籍是愚蠢的原因之一)，值得一试，但这并不容易做到，你也不应该因为它不能100%立即奏效而感到沮丧。</p><p>  Simple advice works when it forces you to think, reminds you of something you forgot about or nudges you in the right direction, and more often takes the form of questions or general suggestions/pointers. For example, “what’s your plan for doing X?” or “what was the original reasoning behind doing X?” are often actually very helpful.</p><p>简单的建议会强迫你思考，提醒你忘记了什么，或者推动你朝着正确的方向前进，而且更多的时候是以问题或一般性建议/指针的形式出现。例如，“你做X的计划是什么？”或者“做X的最初原因是什么？”实际上往往是非常有帮助的。</p><p>  It’s surprising how often the advice that I give people who come to me asking for advice cashes out to some form of “well, have you considered doing the obvious thing?”</p><p>令人惊讶的是，我给来向我寻求建议的人提供的建议，往往会变成某种形式的“嗯，你考虑过做一件显而易见的事情吗？”</p><p> For example, when someone comes to me and says “help, I have a talk I have to give and I’m going to be terribly nervous and I dread it, what do I do?” it’s often surprisingly helpful for me to ask, “well, what sort of things would make you less nervous?” Or someone comes to me and says “I find myself just playing video games all day, how do I stop myself?”, I first ask, “have you considered what sorts of things you’d rather do besides play video games all day?”</p><p>例如，当有人走过来对我说：“帮帮忙，我有一个演讲要做，我会非常紧张，我很害怕，我该怎么办？”令人惊讶的是，我常常会问：“那么，什么样的事情会让你不那么紧张呢？”或者有人来问我：“我发现自己整天都在玩电子游戏，我怎么才能让自己停下来呢？”我首先问道：“除了整天玩电子游戏，你有没有考虑过你更愿意做些什么？”</p><p> In many cases, the obvious prompts aren’t sufficient. But in a surprising number of cases, they are. I still often find this advice useful myself: when my attention slips, I am often helped by someone just asking me to consider the obvious — “what would make the task less dreadful?” or “have you thought for five minutes about alternatives?” or “have you considered delegating this?” and so on.</p><p>在许多情况下，明显的提示是不够的。但在数量惊人的案例中，它们确实如此。我自己仍然经常发现这个建议很有用：当我注意力不集中时，经常有人会帮我想一想显而易见的事情--“怎样才能让这项任务不那么可怕？”或者“你有没有想过五分钟的替代方案？”或者“你有没有考虑过把这件事委托给别人？”诸若此类。</p><p> Our brains are basically  undercooked sausages and it’s both terrifying how easy it is to forget to do all of the obvious things regularly and very encouraging because the bar for doing better is set so low.  This is why I think weekly one-on-ones (therapy, coaching) are actually really helpful.</p><p>我们的大脑基本上就是未煮熟的香肠，忘记定期做所有显而易见的事情是多么容易，而且非常鼓舞人心，因为做得更好的门槛设定得太低了。这就是为什么我认为每周一对一(治疗、辅导)确实很有帮助。</p><p>  It’s especially difficult to figure out what we really care about when we’re young and we should be vigilant to not be swayed by people who are older and who seem like they know what they care about or by our peer group which, as a whole, always seems to know where it’s moving.</p><p>要弄清楚我们年轻时真正关心的是什么尤其困难，我们应该保持警惕，不要被年纪较大、似乎知道自己关心什么的人左右，也不要被我们的同龄人左右，因为作为一个整体，我们的同龄人似乎总是知道事情的走向。</p><p> The only adults teenagers are really exposed to are teachers and professors and I, for example, was very prone to seek advice from those I especially admired. I think I realized that I do not share some of the most important traits for which teachers and professors are selected (lack of desire to build things irl; intellectual play as one of the central pleasures in life, etc.) and that I probably shouldn’t listen too carefully to what my favorite professors think about life a bit too late.</p><p>青少年真正接触到的成年人只有老师和教授，例如，我非常倾向于向那些我特别钦佩的人寻求建议。我想我意识到，我并不认同教师和教授被挑选出来的一些最重要的特质(缺乏创造事物的欲望；智力游戏是生活中的主要乐趣之一，等等)。我可能不应该太仔细地听我最喜欢的教授们对生活的看法，为时已晚。</p><p> I studied economics in the university and there were two standard paths among people around me:</p><p>我在大学里学的是经济学，在我周围的人中有两条标准路径：</p><p>   “I don’t know what I want and I don’t want to have a jerb”</p><p>“我不知道我想要什么，我也不想有个混蛋。”</p><p> “I don’t know what I want but people in finance/consulting make a lot of money and have high optionality so why not”</p><p>“我不知道我想要什么，但金融/咨询行业的人赚得很多，而且有很高的选择权，为什么不呢？”</p><p> also a bit too late and I’m glad all the banks and consulting firms I applied to rejected all of my applications. I felt the pull of having a prestigious job incredibly strongly, even after my blog became fairly popular and I think I got very lucky that I failed to find a job, despite earnestly trying to do it for a long time.</p><p>还有一点太晚了，我很高兴我申请的所有银行和咨询公司都拒绝了我的所有申请。我强烈地感受到了拥有一份体面工作的吸引力，甚至在我的博客变得相当受欢迎之后，我想我很幸运，尽管我热切地尝试了很长一段时间，但我没有找到一份工作。</p><p> The advice we are given is systematically biased not only because people are just bad it figuring out how shit works but also because advice can’t be isolated away from the relationships we have. If a friend suggests you to drop out of school and start a startup or write full-time, they will partly be to-blame for what happens to you when you make that decision (and unconventional life decisions do often end poorly). Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM applies to advice too and advice you receive will be systematically biased in favor of safe choices.</p><p>我们得到的建议是系统性的有偏见的，不仅因为人们很难弄清楚狗屎是如何工作的，还因为建议不能与我们拥有的关系分开。如果一位朋友建议你辍学，开始创业或全职写作，他们会为你做出这个决定时发生的事情承担部分责任(而非传统的人生决定往往以糟糕的结局收场)。没有人因为收购IBM而被解雇，这也适用于你收到的建议，你收到的建议将系统性地偏向于安全的选择。</p><p> One way out of this is to perhaps explicitly  ask something along the lines of “what’s the most outrageous advice you can come up with? what advice are you scared of giving me because you think I’ll blame you if it fails?&#34; and to remember to try to figure out why they believe the things they tell you, why the made the decisions they made, and why they tell you  these specific things whenever someone shares advice with you.</p><p>解决这个问题的一种方法或许是明确地问一些类似这样的问题：“你能想出的最离谱的建议是什么？”你害怕给我什么建议，因为你认为如果失败了我会责怪你？记住要试着弄清楚，为什么他们相信他们告诉你的事情，为什么他们做出了决定，以及为什么每当有人和你分享建议时，他们就会告诉你这些具体的事情。</p><p> Finally, do remember that most people only did 1 or 2 things in their life. The probability that one of them is exactly what you should be doing with your life is very low, and they probably know next to nothing about everything else.</p><p>最后，记住大多数人一生中只做一两件事。其中一个人是你应该在生活中做的事情的概率非常低，他们可能对其他一切几乎一无所知。</p><p>  Giving good advice is both incredibly easy and incredibly difficult. It’s usually helpful to note the motivation, personality, personal circumstances, etc. of the person on the other end of the conversation and to give both of you enough time to figure out what’s  really going on. And yet, sometimes “just do x”  is the best advice you could give and sometimes hearing “just do x” is the best advice you can hear.</p><p>给出好的建议既非常容易，也非常困难。记录谈话另一端的动机、性格、个人情况等通常是有帮助的，并给你们两个足够的时间弄清楚到底是怎么回事。然而，有时“只做x”是你能给出的最好的建议，而有时听到“只做x”是你能听到的最好的建议。</p><p>     after you gave the advice verbally, you can follow up in writing with the key points you made and additional thoughts you came up with in the meantime (with the background on why advice should work, how exactly it worked for you and how you started following it, etc.) also, you can snooze emails and ask how did it go or have a call during which you try figure out if the advice works and if not why</p><p>在口头给出建议之后，你可以书面跟进你提出的要点和你在此期间想出的其他想法(包括为什么建议应该奏效的背景，它对你到底是如何奏效的，以及你是如何开始遵循它的，等等)。此外，你还可以查看电子邮件，询问进展如何，或者打个电话，试着弄清楚这个建议是否奏效，如果不奏效，原因何在。</p><p>  Notably, other people are often better at spotting inconsistencies in our thinking and the self-deceptions we maintain –  The Unreliability of Naive Introspection ( a):</p><p>值得注意的是，其他人往往更善于发现我们思维中的不一致之处和我们坚持的自欺欺人--天真自省的不可靠之处(A)：</p><p> Relatedly, most of us have a pretty poor sense, I suspect, of what brings us pleasure and suffering. Do you really enjoy Christmas? Do you really feel bad while doing the dishes? Are you happier weeding or going to a restaurant with your family? Few people make a serious study of this aspect of their lives, despite the lip service we generally pay to the importance of “happiness.” Most people feel bad a substantial proportion of the time, it seems to me.9 We are remarkably poor stewards of our emotional experience. We may say we’re happy—overwhelmingly we do but we have little idea what we’re talking about.10</p><p>与此相关的是，我怀疑，我们中的大多数人对是什么给我们带来快乐和痛苦的感觉相当差。你真的喜欢圣诞节吗？洗碗的时候你真的感觉不舒服吗？你喜欢除草还是和家人一起去餐馆？很少有人认真研究自己生活的这一方面，尽管我们通常口惠而实不至地强调“幸福”的重要性。在我看来，大多数人在相当大一部分时间里感觉不好。9我们对自己的情绪体验管理得非常糟糕。我们可能会说我们很快乐--绝大多数的人都很快乐，但我们几乎不知道我们在说什么。</p><p> Or consider this: My wife mentions that I seem to be angry about being stuck with the dishes again (despite the fact that doing the dishes makes me happy?). I deny it. I reflect; I sincerely attempt to discover whether I’m angry—I don’t just reflexively defend myself but try to be the good self-psychologist my wife would like me to be—and still I don’t see it. I don’t think I’m angry. But I’m wrong, of course, as I usually am in such situations: My wife reads my face better than I introspect. Maybe I’m not quite boiling inside, but there’s plenty of angry phenomenology to be discovered if I knew better how to look. Or do you think that every time we’re wrong about our emotions, those emotions must be nonconscious, dispositional, not genuinely felt? Or felt and perfectly apprehended phenomenologically but somehow nonetheless mislabeled? Can’t I also err more directly?</p><p>或者想想这个：我妻子提到，我似乎很生气，因为我又要洗碗了(尽管洗碗让我很开心？)。我否认这一点。我反思；我真诚地试图发现我是否生气--我不仅仅是条件反射地为自己辩护，而是努力成为我妻子希望我成为的好的自我心理学家--但我仍然看不到这一点。我不认为我很生气。当然，我错了，就像我通常在这样的情况下一样：我的妻子比我自己更能读懂我的脸。也许我内心并不是很愤怒，但如果我知道如何看起来更好的话，还有很多愤怒的现象学有待发现。或者，你认为每次我们对自己的情绪判断错误时，这些情绪一定是无意识的、性情的、不是真心感受到的？或者感觉到并完美地理解了现象学，但不知何故还是贴错了标签？难道我不能更直接地犯错吗？</p><p>  Imagine a large population of people living, seeing, learning, doing and generally going about their lives. As they do so, they accumulate beliefs. Depending on how smart they are, they also compress beliefs via abstraction, metaphor, subconscious pattern-recognition circuits, muscle memory, ritual, making and consuming art, going p-value fishing, exploring tantric sex, generating irreproducible peer-reviewed Science! and so on.</p><p>想象一下，有一大群人生活、看、学、做，并开始了他们的生活。在这样做的过程中，他们积累了信念。取决于他们有多聪明，他们也会通过抽象、隐喻、潜意识模式识别电路、肌肉记忆、仪式、制作和消费艺术、去p值钓鱼、探索密宗性爱、产生不可复制的同行评议的科学来压缩信仰！诸若此类。</p><p> Some small fraction of this growing mass of beliefs can fuel communication attempts of some sort.</p><p>这种不断增长的信仰中的一小部分可以推动某种形式的交流尝试。</p><p> When two people attempt to hear each other, all communication rests on, and builds on, this shared set. If they mostly get to mutual yes, I hear you now conclusions, communication (of any sort, including non-verbal) creates an attractive force between them, and a repulsive force otherwise.</p><p>当两个人试图听到对方的声音时，所有的交流都建立在这个共享的集合之上。如果他们大多达成共识是的，我现在听到你的结论，沟通(任何形式，包括非语言的)会在他们之间产生吸引力，反之则会产生排斥力。</p><p> But that’s not all there is. There is the gradually snowballing momentum of everything that is not available as fodder for communication, all the unsocialized and incommunicable private dark matter of accumulating lived experience. If this is sufficiently high, the two will drift apart, cognitively speaking, even if their communication is a net yes, I hear you (and you hear me). And as they drift apart, communication will become harder, and slowly</p><p>但这还不是全部。所有不能作为交流素材的东西，所有积累生活经验的非社会化和不可交流的私人暗物质，都有逐渐滚雪球般的势头。如果这个值足够高，这两个人就会疏远，从认知上讲，即使他们的交流是净的，是的，我听到了你的声音(你也听到了我的声音)。随着他们逐渐疏远，沟通将变得更加困难，而且会变得缓慢。</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://guzey.com/advice/">https://guzey.com/advice/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/采纳/">#采纳</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/giving/">#giving</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/建议/">#建议</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
