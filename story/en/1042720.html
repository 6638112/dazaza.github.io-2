With so many virtual event platforms and online ticketing options available to virtual event organizers, we were sure at least one would meet a reasonable standard of accessibility for people who use screen readers or other devices to navigate the Web.</p><p>当我于今年6月开始从事Sight Tech Global的工作时，我有信心我们会很快找到该问题的答案。虚拟事件组织者拥有如此众多的虚拟事件平台和在线票务选项，我们确信至少有一个满足使用屏幕阅读器或其他设备浏览Web的人们的合理访问标准。</p><p> Sadly, I was wrong about that. As I did my due diligence and spoke to CEOs at a variety of platforms, I heard a lot of “we’re studying  WCAG [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines] requirements” or “our developers are going to re-write our front-end code when we have time.” In other words, these operations, like many others on the Web, had not taken the trouble to code their sites for accessibility at the start, which is the least costly and fairest approach, not to mention the one compliant with the ADA.</p><p> 可悲的是，我对此表示错误。当我进行尽职调查并在各种平台上与CEO交谈时，我听到很多“我们正在研究WCAG [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines]要求”或“我们的开发人员将重新编写我们的前端代码”我们有时间的时候。”换句话说，这些操作与Web上的许多其他操作一样，从一开始就没有麻烦地编写其站点的可访问性代码，这是成本最低，最公平的方法，更不用说符合ADA的方法了。</p><p>  This realization was a major red flag. We had announced our event dates – Dec 2-3, 2020 – and there was no turning back.  Dmitry Paperny, our designer, and I did not have much time to figure out a solution. No less important than the dates was the imperative that the event’s virtual experience work well for blind attendees, given that our event was really centered on that community.</p><p>  这种认识是一个重大的危险信号。我们已经宣布了活动日期-2020年12月2日至3日-没有回头路了。我们的设计师Dmitry Paperny和我没有太多时间来寻找解决方案。同样重要的是，鉴于我们的活动确实以该社区为中心，所以必须确保活动的虚拟体验对盲人参与者有效。</p><p> We decided to take Occam’s razor to the conventions surrounding virtual event experiences and answer a key question: What was essential? Virtual event platforms tend to be feature heavy, which compounds accessibility problems. We ranked what really mattered, and the list came down to three things:</p><p> 我们决定将Occam的剃须刀用于围绕虚拟事件体验的约定，并回答一个关键问题：关键是什么？虚拟事件平台的功能往往很繁重，这增加了可访问性问题。我们对真正重要的问题进行了排名，然后将其归结为三点：</p><p>  We also debated adding a social or networking element as well, and decided that was optional unless there was an easy, compelling solution.</p><p>  我们还讨论了添加社交或网络元素的问题，并决定除非有简单，引人注目的解决方案，否则这是可选的。</p><p> The next question was what third-party tools could we use? The very good news was that YouTube and Zoom get great marks for accessibility. People who are blind are familiar with both and many know the keyboard commands to navigate the players. We discovered this largely by word of mouth at first and then discovered ample supporting documentation at YouTube and Zoom. So we chose YouTube for our main stage programming and Zoom for our breakouts. It’s helpful, of course, that it’s very easy to incorporate both YouTube and Zoom in a website, which became our plan.</p><p> 下一个问题是我们可以使用哪些第三方工具？值得庆幸的是，YouTube和Zoom在可访问性方面得分很高。盲人既熟悉又熟悉，而且很多人都知道键盘命令来引导玩家。首先，我们主要是通过口口相传来发现这一点，然后在YouTube和Zoom上发现了足够的支持文档。因此，我们选择YouTube作为主要舞台节目，并选择Zoom作为突破。当然，将YouTube和Zoom整合到网站中非常容易，这是我们的计划，这很有用。</p><p> Where to host the overall experience, was the next question. We wanted to be able to direct attendees to a single URL in order to join the event. Luckily, we had already built an  accessible website to market the event. Dmitry had learned a lot in the course of designing and coding that site, including the importance of thinking about both blind and low-vision users. So we decided to add the event experience to our site itself – instead of using a third-party event platform – by adding two elements to the site navigation – Event (no longer live on the site) and  Agenda.</p><p> 下一个问题是在哪里托管总体经验。我们希望能够将与会者定向到单个URL，以便加入活动。幸运的是，我们已经建立了一个可访问的网站来推广活动。 Dmitry在该站点的设计和编码过程中学到了很多东西，包括思考盲人和弱视用户的重要性。因此，我们决定通过在网站导航中添加两个元素（事件（不再存在于网站上）和议程），而不是使用第三方事件平台，将事件体验添加到我们的网站中。 </p><p> The first amounted to a “page” (in WordPress parlance) that contained the YouTube live player embed, and beneath that text descriptions of the current session and the upcoming session, along with prominent links to the full Agenda. Some folks might ask, why place the agenda on a separate page? Doesn’t that make it more complicated? Good question, and the answer was one of many revelations that came from our partner  Fable, which specializes in usability testing for people with disabilities. The answer, as we found time and again, was to imagine navigating with a screen reader, not your eyes. If the agenda were beneath the YouTube Player, it would create a cacophonous experience – imagine trying to listen to the programming and at the same time “read” (as in “listen to”) the agenda below. A separate page for the agenda was the right idea.</p><p>第一个是一个“页面”（用WordPress的话说），其中嵌入了YouTube直播播放器，在该页面下方是当前会话和即将进行的会话的文字描述，以及指向完整议程的突出链接。有些人可能会问，为什么将议程放在单独的页面上？这不是更复杂吗？这是一个很好的问题，答案是来自我们合作伙伴寓言的众多启示之一，后者专门研究残疾人的可用性测试。我们一次又一次找到答案，那就是想象使用屏幕阅读器而不是眼睛进行导航。如果日程安排在YouTube播放器的下方，那会带来混乱的体验-想象一下尝试收听节目并同时“阅读”（如“收听”）以下日程。安排议程的另一页是正确的想法。</p><p> The  Agenda page was our biggest challenge because it contained a lot of information, required filters and also, during the show, had different “states” – as in which agenda items were “playing now” versus upcoming versus already concluded. Dmitry learned a lot about the best approach to drop downs for filters and other details to make the agenda page navigable, and we reviewed it several times with Fable’s experts. We decided nonetheless to take the fairly unprecedented step of inviting our registered, blind event attendees to join us for a “practice event” a few days before the show in order to get more feedback. Nearly 200 people showed up for two sessions. We also invited blind screen reader experts, including Fable’s Sam Proulx and Facebook’s Matt King, to join us to answer questions and sort out the feedback.</p><p> 议程页面是我们面临的最大挑战，因为它包含大量信息，所需的筛选器，并且在展会期间具有不同的“状态”，即议程项目“正在播放”，即将进行或已结束。德米特里（Dmitry）了解了很多有关下拉列表过滤器和其他细节以使议程页面可导航的最佳方法，并且我们与寓言的专家多次进行了审查。尽管如此，我们还是决定采取相当空前的步骤，邀请我们注册的盲人参与者在展会开始前几天参加“实践活动”，以获取更多反馈。近200人参加了两次会议。我们还邀请了盲人阅读器专家，包括寓言的Sam Proulx和Facebook的Matt King，来回答问题并整理反馈。</p><p> It’s worth noting that there are three major screen readers: JAWS, which is used mostly by Windows’ users; VoiceOver, which is on all Apple products; and NVDA, which is open source and works on PCs running Microsoft Windows 7 SP1 and later. They don’t all work in the same way, and the people who use them range from experts who know hundreds of keyboard commands to occasional users who have more basic skills. For that reason, it’s really important to have expert interlocutors who can help separate good suggestions from simple frustrations.</p><p> 值得注意的是，共有三种主要的屏幕阅读器：JAWS，主要由Windows用户使用； VoiceOver，它在所有Apple产品上都有； NVDA是开放源代码，可在运行Microsoft Windows 7 SP1及更高版本的PC上使用。它们的工作方式不尽相同，使用它们的人从知道数百种键盘命令的专家到偶尔掌握更多基本技能的用户。因此，聘请专业的对话者能够帮助将好的建议与简单的挫败感区分开来，这一点非常重要。</p><p> The format for our open house ( session one and  session two) was a Zoom meeting, where we provided a briefing about the event and how the experience worked. Then we provided links to a working Event page (with a YouTube player active) and the Agenda page and asked people to give it a try and return to the Zoom session with feedback. Like so much else in this effort, the result was humbling. We had the basics down well, but we had missed some nuances, such as the best way to order information in an agenda item for someone who can only “hear” it versus “see” it. Fortunately, we had time to tune the agenda page a bit more before the show.</p><p> 开放日的形式（第一场和第二场）是Zoom会议，在那场会议上，我们简要介绍了该活动及其工作原理。然后，我们提供了指向活动的“活动”页面（活动YouTube播放器）和“议程”页面的链接，并要求人们尝试一下并返回到具有反馈的“缩放”会话。像其他许多努力一样，结果令人感到谦卑。我们的基础知识很好，但是却错过了一些细微差别，例如对于只能“听”到“看”到某人的人来说，在议程项目中订购信息的最佳方法。幸运的是，我们有时间在展会开始之前对议程页面进行了一些调整。</p><p> The practice session also reinforced that we had made a good move to offer live customer support during the show as a buffer for attendees who were less sophisticated in the use of screen readers. We partnered with  Be My Eyes, a mobile app that connects blind users to sighted helpers who use the blind person’s phone camera to help troubleshoot issues. It’s like having a friend look over your shoulder. We recruited 10 volunteers and trained them to be ready to answer questions about the event, and Be My Eyes put them at the top of the list for any calls related to Sight Tech Global, which was listed under the Be My Eyes “event’ section.  Our event host, the incomparable Will Butler, who happens to be a vice-president at Be My Eyes, regularly reminded attendees to use Be My Eyes if they needed help with the virtual experience.</p><p> 实践会议还强调说，我们在展会期间做出了很大的努力，即提供实时的客户支持，以缓冲不太熟练使用屏幕阅读器的与会者。我们与Be My Eyes合作，Be My Eyes是一个移动应用程序，可将盲人用户与使用盲人电话摄像头帮助发现问题的有视力的帮助者联系起来。就像有一个朋友看着你的肩膀。我们招募了10名志愿者，并对其进行了培训，可以随时回答有关活动的问题，并且Be My Eyes将其列为与Sight Tech Global相关的所有呼叫的列表的顶部，该呼叫已在Be My Eyes“事件”部分中列出。 。我们的活动主持人，恰好是Be My Eyes的副总裁的无与伦比的Will Butler，定期提醒与会者如果需要虚拟体验方面的帮助，请使用Be My Eyes。</p><p> A month out from the event, we were feeling confident enough that we decided to add a social interaction feature to the show. Word on the street was that  Slido’s basic Q&amp;A features worked well with screen readers, and in fact Fable used the service for its projects. So we added Slido to the program. We did not embed a Slido widget beneath the YouTube player, which might have been a good solution for sighted participants, but instead added a link to each agenda session to a standalone Slido page, where attendees could add comments and ask questions without getting tangled in the agenda or the livestream.  The solution ended up working well, and we had more than 750 comments and questions on Slido during the show.</p><p> 活动结束一个月后，我们感到非常有信心，因此决定为节目添加社交互动功能。大街上有消息说，Slido的基本Q＆amp; A功能与屏幕阅读器配合得很好，实际上Fable在其项目中使用了该服务。因此，我们在程序中添加了Slido。我们并未在YouTube播放器下方嵌入Slido小部件，这可能是有见识的参与者的一个不错的解决方案，而是在每个议事日程的链接上添加了一个独立的Slido页面，参与者可以在其中添加评论和提问而不会陷入混乱。议程或直播。该解决方案最终运行良好，在展会期间，我们对Slido提出了750多个评论和问题。</p><p> When Dec. 2 finally arrived, we were ready. But the best-laid plans often go awry, we were only minutes into the event when suddenly our live, closed-captioning broke. We decided to halt the show until we could bring that back up live, for the benefit of deaf and hard-of-hearing attendees. After much scrambling, captioning came back. (See more on captioning below).</p><p> 当12月2日终于到来时，我们已经准备好了。但是，布置最完善的计划常常会出错，当活动现场的隐藏字幕突然中断时，我们只有几分钟的路程。我们决定暂停演出，直到可以恢复直播为止，以使聋哑人和听障人士受益。经过多方争夺之后，字幕又回来了。 （有关字幕的更多信息，请参见下文）。 </p><p> Otherwise, the production worked well from a programming standpoint as well as accessibility. How did we do? Of the 2400+ registered attendees at the event, 45% said they planned to use screen readers. When we did a survey of those attendees immediately after the show, 95 replied and they gave the experience a 4.6/5 score. As far as the programming, our attendees (this time asked everyone – 157 replies) gave us a score of 4.7/5. Needless to say, we were delighted by those outcomes.</p><p>否则，从编程和可访问性的角度来看，产品都运行良好。我们是怎么做的？在活动的2400多名注册参加者中，有45％表示他们计划使用屏幕阅读器。展会结束后我们立即对这些参与者进行了调查，有95人回答了，他们给这次体验给出了4.6 / 5的分数。就编程而言，我们的参与者（这次问所有人-157个答复）给了我们4.7 / 5的分数。不用说，我们对这些结果感到高兴。</p><p> One other note concerned registration. At the outset, we also “heard” that one of the event registration platforms was “as good as it gets” for accessibility. We took that at face value, which was a mistake. We should have tested because comments for people trying to register as well as a low turnout of registration from blind people revealed after a few weeks that the registration site may have been better than the rest but was still really disappointing. It was painful, for example, to learn from one of our speakers that  alt tags were missing from images (and there was no way to add them) and that the screen reader users had to tab through mountains of information in order to get to actionable links, such as “register.”</p><p> 另一注涉及注册。一开始，我们还“听说”事件注册平台之一“可获取”。我们以表面价值来对待，这是一个错误。我们应该进行测试，因为几周后，针对尝试注册的人的评论以及盲人的低注册率表明，注册网站可能比其他网站更好，但仍然令人失望。例如，从我们的一位发言人那里得知图像中缺少alt标签（并且无法添加它们），并且屏幕阅读器用户不得不浏览大量信息才能采取行动，这真是令人痛苦链接，例如“注册”。</p><p> As we did with our approach to the website, we decided that the best course was to simplify. We added a  Google Form as an alternative registration option. These are highly accessible. We instantly saw our registrations increase strongly, particularly among blind people. We were chagrined to realize that our first choice for registration had been excluding the very people our event intended to include.</p><p> 正如我们对网站的处理方式一样，我们认为最好的方法就是简化。我们添加了Google表单作为替代注册选项。这些都是高度可访问的。我们立即看到我们的注册人数猛增，尤其是在盲人当中。我们很沮丧地意识到，我们注册的第一选择就是排除了本次活动打算招募的人员。</p><p> We were able to use the Google Forms option because the event was free. Had we been trying to collect payment of registration fees, Google Form would not have been an option. Why did we make the event free to all attendees? There are several reasons. First, given our ambitions to make the event global and easily available to anyone interested in blindness, it was difficult to arrive at a universally acceptable price point. Second, adding payment as well as a “log-in” feature to access the event itself would create another accessibility headache. With our approach, anyone with the link to the Agenda or Event page could attend without any log-in demand or registration. We knew this would create some leakage in terms of knowing who attended the event – quite a lot in fact because we had 30% more attendees than registrants – but given the nature of the event we thought that losing out on names and emails was an acceptable price to pay considering the accessibility benefit.</p><p> 我们可以使用Google表格选项，因为该活动是免费的。如果我们一直试图收取注册费，那么Google表单将不是一个选择。我们为什么让所有参与者免费参加活动？有几个原因。首先，鉴于我们的雄心壮志，使该活动具有全球性且对盲人感兴趣的任何人都可以轻松获得，因此很难达到一个普遍接受的价格点。其次，增加支付以及“登录”功能以访问事件本身将造成另一个可访问性麻烦。使用我们的方法，任何链接到“议程”或“事件”页面的人都可以参加，而无需任何登录要求或注册。我们知道，就知道谁参加了活动而言，这会造成一定程度的泄漏-事实上，这是因为我们的参加者比注册者多30％-但鉴于该活动的性质，我们认为输掉姓名和电子邮件是可以接受的考虑到无障碍获取的好处要付出的代价。</p><p> If there is an overarching lesson from this exercise, it’s simply this: Event organizers have to roll up their sleeves and really get to the bottom of whether the experience is accessible or not. It’s not enough to trust platform or technology vendors, unless they have standout reputations in the community, as YouTube and Zoom do. It’s as important to ensure that the site or platform is coded appropriately (to WCAG standards, and using a tool like Google’s  LightHouse) as it is to do real-world testing to ensure that the actual, observable experience of blind and low-vision users is a good one. At the end of the day, that’s what counts the most.</p><p> 如果从本练习中学到一个总的教训，那就很简单：活动组织者必须袖手旁观，并真正弄清是否可以访问该体验。除非平台或技术供应商在社区中拥有出色的声誉（如YouTube和Zoom那样），否则仅靠平台或技术供应商是不够的。确保对网站或平台进行适当的编码（符合WCAG标准，并使用Google的LightHouse之类的工具）与进行真实世界的测试以确保盲人和弱视用户的实际可观察​​体验一样重要是一个好人。归根结底，这才是最重要的。</p><p> A final footnote. Although our event focused on accessibility issues for people who are blind or have low vision, we were committed from the start to include captions for people who would benefit. We opted for the best quality outcome, which is still human (versus AI) captioners, and we worked with  VITAC to provide captions for the live Zoom and YouTube sessions and  3Play Media for the on-demand versions and the transcripts, which are now part of the permanent record. We also heard requests for “plain text” (no mark-up) versions of the transcripts in an easily downloadable version for people who use Braille-readers. We supplied those, as well. You can see how all those resources came together on pages   like this one, which contain all the information on a given session and are linked from the relevant section of the agenda.</p><p> 最后的脚注。尽管我们的活动主要针对盲人或视力低下人士的无障碍获取问题，但我们从一开始就致力于为受益者提供字幕。我们选择了质量最好的结果，仍然是人类（与AI相比）的字幕制作者，并且我们与VITAC合作为实时Zoom和YouTube会话提供字幕，并为点播版本和字幕提供了3Play Media字幕，现在已成为一部分永久记录。我们还听到了对抄写本的“纯文本”（无标记）版本的要求，该版本以易于下载的版本提供给使用盲文阅读器的人们。我们也提供了这些。您可以在类似这样的页面上看到所有这些资源是如何汇集在一起​​的，这些页面包含给定会话的所有信息，并且从议程的相关部分进行链接。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/imagine-being-blind-and-trying-to-attend-a-virtual-event-try-that-next-time-you-stage-one/">https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/imagine-being-blind-and-trying-to-attend-a-virtual-event-try-that-next-time-you-stage-one/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/登台/">#登台</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/blind/">#blind</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/活动/">#活动</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
