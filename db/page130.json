", "note_en": "State of Repair is Motherboard&#39;s exploration of DIY culture, device repair, ownership, and the forces fighting to lock down access to the things you own.\n  On Thursday, Congressman Joseph Morelle (D-NY) filed national right-to-repair legislation with Congress. The Fair Repair Act would require manufacturers to provide device owners and independent repair stores access to the tools, parts, and information they need to fix electronics. If it passed, people could fix their own stuff without having to return their stuff without going through the people who made it. Farmers could fix their own tractors and we could all more easily fix our own phones.\n    Thus far, the overwhelming majority of right-to-repair legislation has been introduced at the state level; national legislation would obviously make implementation easier, because it would prevent different states from having different laws about electronics that all Americans own.\n  \u201cFor too long, large corporations have hindered the progress of small business owners and everyday Americans by preventing them from the right to repair their own equipment,\u201d Rep. Morelle said in a   statement. \u201cIt\u2019s long past time to level the playing field, which is why I\u2019m so proud to introduce the Fair Repair Act and put the power back in the hands of consumers. This common-sense legislation will help make technology repairs more accessible and affordable for items from cell phones to laptops to farm equipment, finally giving individuals the autonomy they deserve.\u201d\n  Morelle has previously tried to pass right-to-repair legislation at the   state level when he was Assembly Majority Leader of New York in 2018. The bill died before anyone could vote on it. But that was three years ago and a lot has changed. More than   half the states in the country are considering some form of right-to-repair legislation. Last week, the New York state Senate   passed right-to-repair legislation similar to what Morelle has filed at Congress.\n    The legislation is overwhelmingly popular with both Democrats and Republicans, but getting bills passed has been very difficult because major companies and lobbying groups have managed to scare legislators in many states and have gotten the bills killed.\n  &#34;Right to Repair just makes sense. It saves money and it keeps electronics in use and off the scrap heap. It helps farmers keep equipment in the field and out of the dealership,\u201d Nathan Proctor, U.S. PIRG Senior Right to Repair Campaign Director, said in a   press release. \u201cNo matter how many lobbyists Apple, Microsoft, John Deere and other big companies hire to put obstacles in the way of us fixing our stuff, Right to Repair keeps pushing ahead, thanks to champions such as Rep. Morelle.&#34;\n  The Fair Repair Act does more than force the manufacturer&#39;s hand, it punishes them if they don\u2019t comply. \u201cThis bill allows for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to penalize those who violate these provisions through civil penalties including payment of damages, reformation of contracts, and refund of money or property,\u201d Morelle said in a   press release. \u201cIt also empowers the FTC to promulgate any rules or regulations necessary to carry out these enforcement duties. The Fair Repair Act authorizes state attorneys general to enforce the bill\u2019s provisions as well.\u201d\n  \u201cAt iFixit, we believe that big tech companies shouldn\u2019t get to dictate how we use the things we own or keep us from fixing our stuff,\u201d iFixit\u2019s US Policy Lead, Kerry Maeve Sheehan, told Motherboard. \u201cWe applaud Congressman Morelle for taking the fight for Right to Repair to Congress and standing up for farmers, independent repair shops, and consumers nationwide.\u201d\n  People want to fix their   own stuff. No one wants to pay $400 to replace an iPhone when a cheap fix would solve all their problems. But this issue affects more than just consumer electronics. Farmers have been dealing with this issue for years. As their farm equipment has gotten more complex, manufacturers like   John Deere have operated an effective monopoly on repairs.\n  Big tech and others have strong lobbying groups working against right-to-repair laws, but with 27 states working on some form of legislation and this new bill filed in Congress, an era where everyone can cheaply fix their own stuff is starting to feel inevitable.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 08:11:44", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u63d0\u4ea4,repair,\u4fee\u590d", "title": "\u56fd\u4f1a\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u6743\u91cd\u91d1\u6cd5\u6848 ", "title_en": "National Right-to-Repair Bill Filed in Congress", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7e37d/national-right-to-repair-bill-filed-in-congress", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u63d0\u4ea4", "repair", "\u4fee\u590d"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "94735d716eb33a484249bad2d36ed3e8.jpg", "infoid": 1066616, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6b22\u8fce\u56de\u52306\u670817\u65e5\u661f\u671f\u56db\u7684\u65e5\u5e38\u54ac\u56bc\u3002\u8c22\u8c22\u6c83\u5c14\u7279\u6c64\u666e\u68ee\u548c\u989d\u5916\u7684\u7d27\u7f29\u5de5\u4f5c\u4eba\u5458\u4ece\u4e9a\u5386\u514b\u65af\u63a5\u53d7\u7f30\u7ef3\u3002\u6211\u88ab\u91ca\u653e\u4e86\u966a\u5ba1\u56e2\u804c\u8d23\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u4f1a\u5728\u4e00\u5468\u7684\u5269\u4f59\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u770b\u5230\u4f60\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u5019\u90fd\u7ecf\u5e38\u5b9a\u671f\u5b89\u6392\u4e9a\u5386\u514b\u65af\u3002\n \u4f46\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u7ee7\u7eed\u5c55\u4f1a\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u6211\u60f3\u8ba9\u4f60\u77e5\u9053Duolingo\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u603b\u76d1\u5c06\u52a0\u5165\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u805a\u5149\u706f\uff1a\u5339\u5179\u5821\u8d5b\u4e8b\u53ea\u5728\u4e24\u5468\u5185\u3002 Karin Tsai\u4e8e2012\u5e74\u52a0\u5165\u516c\u53f8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5176\u7b2c\u4e00\u53f0\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5e76\u770b\u5230\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4ece\u9677\u5165\u56f0\u5883\u7684\u542f\u52a8\u4e2d\u6210\u957f\u4e3a400\u4eba\u5168\u7403\u4e1a\u52a1\u3002\n    \u8c37\u6b4c\u6700\u8fd1\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5b83\u7684Android\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5141\u8bb8\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u6084\u6084\u5730\u4ece\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u7a83\u53d6\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u6293\u4f4f\u4e86\u5b83\uff0c\u63d2\u4e86\u5e76\u786e\u8ba4\u5b83\u6ca1\u6709\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\u4efb\u4f55\u4eba\u7684\u6570\u636e\u90fd\u53d7\u5230\u635f\u5bb3\u3002\n \u53c2\u8bae\u5458Kirsten Gillibrand\uff08D-Ny\uff09\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u6cd5\u6848\uff0c\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u5c06\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u7f8e\u56fd\u8054\u90a6\u673a\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u62a4\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u514d\u4e8e\u5728\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u540e\u9662\u7ecf\u8425\u7684\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u505a\u6cd5\u3002\n \u7531Oculus\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u548c\u5356\u5bb6\u5230Facebook Palmer Luckey\u6210\u7acb\u7684AI\u52a8\u529b\u9632\u5fa1\u516c\u53f8\u5df2\u964d\u843d4.5\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u6295\u8d44\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6295\u8d44\u4ef7\u503c46\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u4ec5\u965046\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n  \u5355\u4f4d\u5df2\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e2d\u7b79\u96c6\u4e865100\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u91d1\u878d\u91d1\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u51e0\u5206\u949f\u5185\u5efa\u7acb\u94f6\u884c\u4ea7\u54c1\u3002\u201c\n \u8ba8\u8bba\u5de5\u4f5c\u62db\u8058\u4e2d\u65ad\uff1a\u6ce2\u96ea\u533a\u7b79\u96c6\u4e861.38\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u7ee7\u7eed\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u77e5\u9053\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u632f\u5174\u5728\u7ebf\u5de5\u4f5c\u62db\u8058\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u516c\u53f8\u7684Ingrid\u62a5\u544a\u79f0\uff0c\u516c\u53f8\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u4eba\u624d\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u201d\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff1a\u201c\u7ba1\u7406\u91c7\u8d2d\uff0c\u62db\u8058\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u4eba\u624d\u6620\u50cf\u3002\u201d \nNylas\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528API\u200b\u200b\u5c06\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\uff0c\u65e5\u5386\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6b63\u5728\u5ba3\u5e03\u5927\u91cf\u8d44\u91d1\u6269\u5927\u5176\u4e1a\u52a1 -

", "note_en": "This acquisition comes just a few months after the Philadelphia-based startup  announced a $1.15 billion funding round at a $8.9 billion valuation, up from $3.9 billion in October. Last fall, the company also  raised $380 million and  bought BevMo, a beverage retailer. Gopuff did not share its updated valuation with this new acquisition.\n Gopuff provides delivery of everything from cleaning and pet products to over-the-counter medication and food in more than 650 U.S. cities, charging $1.95 for delivery that happens in 30 minutes or less and is available either very late or even 24/7.\n  This will be incredibly important as the company looks to expand into New York this year, a place where residents expect high rent prices to come with the opportunity to have anything from hummus to diapers delivered at 4 a.m. Speaking of diapers, Gopuff told TechCrunch it has just doubled its baby category and added hundreds of new local products, and that it has expanded to delivering beauty products and  \u201cbetter-for-you\u201d products, which seem to be a mix of organic stuff and healthier snacks.\n  Gopuff also  acquired U.K.-based Fancy Delivery in May, marking its first entrance into international markets. As the company prepares to expand in more complex and high-density cities and enter into new verticals, Gopuff says rideOS\u2019s tech geared toward advanced routing, complex dispatch and fleet optimization will be essential. The company aims to use its new IP to better power multimodal deliveries and reduce delivery times.\n By acquiring rideOS, Gopuff also hopes to improve its unit economics and develop new tools to help both its delivery managers and partners be more organized and efficient on the ground, the company says. RideOS, a platform created and led by former Uber, Google and Apple employees in the mapping and ride-hailing space, sees this acquisition as a chance to scale and stay at the forefront of defining the Instant Needs economy.\n \u201cGopuff\u2019s mission and global ambition to be the world\u2019s go-to solution for immediate everyday needs is a natural extension of rideOS\u2019 vision to build software that efficiently moves people and things throughout the world,\u201d said Justin Ho, co-founder and CEO of rideOS, in a statement. \u201cGiven Gopuff\u2019s exponential growth, we expect to significantly increase our headcount by the end of this year, expanding our presence in Silicon Valley, Pittsburgh, and Berlin.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-18 07:34:22", "source_domain":

The map also includes data on places that reported a lack of connection by computer, smartphone or tablet and information on broadband usage in high-poverty communities.\n &#34;What it tells you is there&#39;s a lot of places in the United States that aren&#39;t using the internet at broadband speeds,&#34; a White House official told Axios, estimating that means tens of millions of people.\n The big picture: The Biden administration originally proposed a $100 billion investment in broadband as part of the American Jobs Plan infrastructure package.\n \u201cAs we release this important data to the public, it paints a sobering view of the challenges facing far too many Americans as they try to connect to high-speed broadband and participate in our modern economy,\u201d Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a statement.\n The intrigue: The map shows the gulf between the data set the FCC has used to map broadband availability and where Americans actually report using the internet.\n The FCC relies on data supplied by internet service providers about where they could offer service.\n Companies can report that a census block is served even if only one household has internet service \u2014 which leads to maps that  overstates access.\n &#34;There&#39;s a large gap between what the carriers are saying is on offer to be used and what&#39;s actually being used,&#34; the White House official told Axios.\n Yes, but: Acting FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel announced a broadband mapping task force earlier this year to improve the agency&#39;s data collection and mapping tools.\n The FCC uses its maps to allocate billions of dollars of subsidies for broadband deployment.\n The administration effort is not meant to replace those maps or guide broadband funding grants, the White House says.\n What they&#39;re saying: &#34;To ensure that every household has the internet access necessary for success in the digital age, we need better ways to accurately measure where high-speed service has reached Americans and where it has not,\u201d Rosenworcel said in a statement.\n The new map project is &#34;a welcome new tool that provides valuable insight into the state of broadband across the country,&#34; she said.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 07:27:20", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u663e\u793a,house,\u5bbd\u5e26", "title":

stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.\u201d What he meant was that objective, raw numbers don\u2019t lie\u2014and this remains true hundreds of years later.\n We just got yet another example. A   new data analysis  from Harvard University, Brown University, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation calculates how different employment levels have been impacted during the pandemic to date. The findings reveal that government lockdown orders devastated workers at the bottom of the financial food chain but left the upper-tier actually  better  off.\n The analysis examined employment levels in January 2020, before the coronavirus spread widely and before lockdown orders and other restrictions on the economy were implemented. It compared them to employment figures from March 31, 2021.\n  Employment for lower-wage workers, defined as earning less than $27,000 annually, declined by a whopping 23.6 percent over the time period. Employment for middle-wage workers, defined as earning from $27,000 to $60,000, declined by a modest 4.5 percent. However, employment for high-wage workers, defined as earning more than $60,000, actually  increased  2.4 percent over the measured time period despite the country\u2019s economic turmoil.\n   The data are damning. They offer yet another reminder that government lockdowns hurt most those who could least afford it.\n Some critics argue that the pandemic, not government lockdowns, are the true source of this economic duress. While there\u2019s no doubt the virus itself played some role, government lockdowns were undoubtedly the single biggest factor. It\u2019s pretty intuitive that ordering people not to patronize businesses and criminalizing peoples\u2019 livelihoods would hurt the economy. This intuition is   confirmed by data  and   studies showing as much . And don\u2019t forget the fact that heavy lockdown states have consistently   had much higher unemployment rates  than states that took a more laissez-faire approach.\n Others might insist that the mitigation of the spread of COVID-19 accomplished by lockdowns justifies this economic fallout. But this argument fails to account for the many peer-reviewed studies showing lockdown orders   did not effectively slow the pandemic\u2019s spread , or the painfully inconvenient fact that most COVID-19 spread occurred not in workplaces, restaurants, or gyms   but at home . (Making \u201cstay-at-home orders\u201d seem like   an astonishing mistake in hindsight .)\n So, all lockdowns really seem to have accomplished is at best a mild delay in the pandemic\u2019s trajectory in exchange for a host of   lethal unintended consequences  such as a   mental health crisis  and   skyrocketing drug overdoses . And, as we now know, a highly regressive economic fallout for the working class.\n Of course, Ivy League researchers almost certainly did not intend to expose the failings of big government pandemic policies when they set out to catalog employment data. But, as Adams said, facts are stubborn things.\n Like this story?

", "note_en": "Microsoft is getting ready to announce the biggest update to Windows since Windows 10\u2019s debut in 2015. Even though the company hasn\u2019t officially revealed much about this update, all signs -- including a major leak of an early Windows 11 build -- point to it offering a significantly different experience.\n  Though Microsoft hasn\u2019t confirmed the name change, it has strongly hinted at it, both in the artwork for its June 24 press event and in its 11 a.m. starting time. And, the leaked Windows 11 build shows Windows 11 as the official name in the system information menu. In\n    Microsoft started teasing Windows 11 on June 2 with an invitation to a digital event called \u201cWhat\u2019s Next for Windows\u201d scheduled for June 24 at 11 a.m. ET. The invitation featured a GIF showcasing a redesigned Windows logo that defies the laws of physics by casting just two shadows that, if you squint, look a bit like \u201c11.\u201d\n  Join us June 24th at 11 am ET for the #MicrosoftEvent to see what\u2019s next. https://t.co/kSQYIDZSyi pic.twitter.com/Emb5GPHOf0 June 2, 2021\n  Right now, there are no official screen shots, but a leaked build that appeared on June 15, 2021 offers a lot of information on at least some of the UI changes. Windows Central recorded a detailed hands-on video with the leak, which we&#39;ve embedded below. Keep in mind that this is an alleged leak so may not be real and, even if it is, it would be an early build with a ton of features missing.\n    Taskbar: the default icons, including the Start button and search button are in the middle, a position which reminds us a lot of Chrome OS. However, you can tweak the location in settings so that the icons appear on the traditional, left side of the taskbar.\n Start menu: It&#39;s a new Windows so, of course, there&#39;s a new Start menu design. This one eschews live tiles for simple icons that show your pinned apps, along with recommended apps and files. A menu button that says &#34;All apps&#34; lets you see more icons.\n  Start menu options: There  seems to be an option to have the Start menu, Taskbar, and other interface elements appear on the left side of the screen if you prefer, which should make the transition to Windows 11 a bit easier for long-time Windows users.\n  Search box pops up: Instead of having a search box within the task bar, there&#39;s only a magnifying glass icon, which you click to get a search menu.\n  File explorer icons: The folder icons are more colorful, particularly for standard folders like \u00a0Documents and Pictures.\n Snap assist menu: If you hover over the minimize / maximize button, Windows 11 gives you a list of choices for snapping your windows to either side of the screen or into quarters.\n  A redesigned Ink Workspace: Windows 11&#39;s new Ink Workspace panel  appears to offer more customization than its predecessor thanks to support for additional software\u2014the Windows 10 version was limited to the first-party Snip &amp; Sketch and Microsoft Whiteboard apps\u2014as well as some user interface tweaks.\n  New system sounds: Some of the sounds like the Asterisk, which sounds a lot like the tone you hear when some elevator doors open, are new.\n Touch gestures: You can now use three finger swipes to minimize / maximize an app. \u00a0Tapping with four fingers lets you switch among virtual desktops.\n  Before the leak pretty-much confirmed it, there were many reasons to believe the new Windows would be called Windows 11. Those shadows in the Tweet picture probably would have been enough to inspire speculation about Windows 11 on their own, but scheduling the event for 11 a.m. ET also helped. Many of Microsoft\u2019s events are held later in the day \u2014 especially since the pandemic forced those events to be online-only \u2014 because the company is based on the West Coast. The working theory is that Microsoft wouldn\u2019t have scheduled an event so early in the day without a good reason; synchronicity with the new version number would qualify.\n A screen shot of the system information page from the leaked build shows the version as Windows 11 Pro.\n   As for why everyone thinks Microsoft is moving on from  Windows 10 even though it was supposed to be \u201c  the last version of Windows\u201d? Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said at the   Build 2021 developer conference in May that the company plans to \u201cshare one of the most significant updates to Windows of the past decade,\u201d which he called \u201cthe next generation of Windows,\u201d some time \u201csoon\u201d after the conference. So the speculation is supported by more than just a GIF and an event\u2019s start time.\n Microsoft accidentally revealed that it\u2019s working on a new version of Windows in a support document too, with  Windows Latest reporting on June 9 that the document offered to teach readers \u201dabout managing applications in Windows 10 and Windows Sun Valley.\u201d That mention all but confirms Microsoft is planning to release a new version of Windows in the near future and will continue to support Windows 10 in the meantime.\n The document previously referred to &#34;Windows Sun Valley,&#34; but that&#39;s since been removed. Windows 11 seems like the most likely name for the update, but it\u2019s not like Windows Sun Valley would seem outlandish  compared to other  platforms\u2019 version names.\n A more intentional teaser for the next generation of Windows arrived on June 10 when Microsoft published a &#34;slo-fi remix&#34; video of the OS&#39; startup sounds.\n &#34;Having trouble relaxing because you\u2019re too excited for the June 24th Microsoft Event?&#34; the video description reads. &#34;Take a slow trip down memory lane with the Windows 95, XP and 7 startup sounds slowed down to a meditative 4,000% reduced speed.&#34;\n   Microsoft also  updated the lifecycle documentation for Windows 10 Home and Pro to say it will officially drop support for the Home, Pro, Pro Education, and Pro for Workstation versions of the operating system on October 14, 2025. (It didn&#39;t say how long the enterprise-specific versions of Windows 10 will continue to be supported.)\n Continued support for individual versions of Windows 10 will vary. Microsoft said the Windows 10 May 2021 Update will stop being supported on December 13, 2022 but also said it &#34;will continue to support at least one Windows 10 Semi-Annual Channel until October 14, 2025.&#34;\n Regardless of the specific timeline, publicly announcing that Windows 10 support will come to an end is the surest sign yet that Microsoft is planning to leave that branding behind with the update arriving on June 24.\n Also, consider that changing the name of Windows is a great way to generate interest and even spur more PC sales. Everytime there&#39;s a new version of Windows, shopppers want to buy computers with that OS pre-installed, even if upgrading is easy.\n  Reports indicate that Microsoft has been planning many changes to the Windows 10 user experience for a while now. Windows Central   reported in October that the company was looking to \u201cupdate many top-level user interfaces, such as the Start menu, Action Center and even File Explorer with consistent modern designs, better animations and new features\u201d via a project known internally as \u201cSun Valley\u201d\u2014the same codename used in the aforementioned support document.\n Sun Valley wasn\u2019t supposed to replace the Fluent Design language Microsoft   introduced at Build 2017 and expanded to   iOS, Android and the web in 2019, Windows Central said, but was instead meant to expand the design language to additional parts of Windows. This would likely result in a more cohesive user experience than the hodgepodge of design languages present in Windows 10.\n  Some of these small-but-notable design problems   were pointed out by Microsoft program manager Yulia Klein in the public GitHub repository for WinUI in November 2020. Klein said that \u201cXAML controls are inconsistent with how web and mobile apps are evolving\u201d and that her proposed changes were \u201cpart of the work to refresh Xaml UI to align with other platforms while looking familiar on Windows.\u201d\n The proposal included changes to toggle switches, sliders and rating controls used throughout Windows. These user interface elements are nearly ubiquitous; changes would likely have a greater-than-expected effect on the OS&#39; design. Klein\u2019s post also made it clear that Microsoft was indeed looking to update Windows\u2019 design, lending credence to the Windows Central report from a month prior.\n  Microsoft\u2019s plans to modernize the Windows user experience were all but confirmed   by a job listing in January that said:\n \u201cOn this team, you\u2019ll work with our key platform, Surface and OEM partners to orchestrate and deliver a sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows experiences to signal to our customers that Windows is BACK and ensure that Windows is considered the best user OS experience for customers.\u201d\n Another  job listing seeking a Senior Program Manager was  posted in April. Microsoft said whoever it hired would be \u201cbuilding new parts and modernizing existing parts of the Windows UX\u201d and that it was \u201clooking for someone who will work with design, research, and prototypers to envision how people will interact with Windows devices in the future.\u201d The company is no longer accepting new applications for the position, which suggests it either found the right candidate or is late in the interview process.\n  It wasn\u2019t hard to connect the dots between Sun Valley and that job listing. As for what this \u201csweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows\u201d might look like? Well, those also came from Microsoft itself.\n The company planned to make several changes to the user experience for Windows 10X, the OS meant for foldable devices   that was repurposed to single-screen devices and   eventually cancelled altogether.\n Microsoft released a   Windows 10X emulator for developers at Build 2020 that showcased a few user experience changes, including a redesigned app switcher, new Start menu and Quick Settings menu for commonly used controls. Now that the changes originally meant for Windows 10X are   reaching Windows proper instead, it would make sense for some of these elements to make their way to Windows 11.\n The similarities between screenshots from the June 15th leak and Windows 10X are readily apparent. Simply compare this:\n    These user experience changes probably won\u2019t be as stark as the jump from Windows 7 to Windows 8. It seems more like Microsoft is fully committing to the Fluent Design language it revealed 4 years ago, looking to improve the Windows experience on touchscreen devices and making seemingly inconsequential changes that culminate in a familiar, yet noticeably different, way of using Windows.\n  Windows 11 might not just change the way the OS looks; it   could also change the way people find, purchase and install software. That seems to be what Microsoft is hoping, at least, because the company is reportedly working to make the Microsoft Store more important to Windows users and developers alike.\n  Windows Central   reported in April that Microsoft plans to make three developer-facing changes to its software distribution platform: allowing unpackaged Win32 apps into the Microsoft Store, letting developers host apps and updates themselves and permitting the use of third-party commerce platforms. All three would make it easier for Windows developers to offer their products via the Microsoft Store in addition to (or instead of) other distribution options.\n The company is also appealing directly to developers\u2019 wallets. It   announced at Build 2021 that it will reduce the cut of game sales revenues the Microsoft Store gets from 30% to 12%.\n That change isn\u2019t groundbreaking (the Epic Games Store offers a similar arrangement) but does make the Microsoft Store more competitive with platforms like Steam. It\u2019s also less than the cut Microsoft takes for other apps sold via the Microsoft Store.\n Microsoft currently takes a 15% cut of the revenues from many apps sold via its platform. It also takes a 30% cut from app and in-app purchases made via the \u201cMicrosoft Store for Business; Microsoft Store for Education; Microsoft Store on Windows 8 devices; or Microsoft Store on Windows Phone 8 devices\u201d per the   App Developer Agreement updated in July 2020. Maybe the new rate for game sales hasn\u2019t been added because similar changes are coming to other apps.\n  The Microsoft Store is also expected to receive a visual overhaul similar to the rest of Windows 11, according to the Windows Central report, as well as updates meant to provide \u201ca more stable download and install experience for large apps and games.\u201d Both could improve the experience of finding software via Microsoft\u2019s storefront (even if many Windows users are likely to continue installing apps via the web or competitive platforms simply because that\u2019s what they&#39;re used to).\n This is also a symbiotic relationship. Right now Microsoft has to figure out how to get developers to ship their apps via the Microsoft Store even though it\u2019s not popular among consumers, which means it has to get consumers to download apps via the Microsoft Store even though many developers aren\u2019t invested in the platform. A new version of Windows (aka Windows 11) provides the perfect opportunity for Microsoft to address both of those problems without carrying the baggage associated with the store\u2019s current iteration.\n  This might be the biggest question mark ahead of Microsoft\u2019s event. The company usually releases major updates to Windows 10 twice a year: once in the spring and once in the fall. The   Windows 10 May 2021 Update&#39;s release last month makes a September or October launch window for Windows 11 seem like a possibility.\n It can be hard to predict OS release dates, however. Microsoft announced Windows 10X in February 2020 with a planned fall 2020 release date, then announced in July 2020 that the it wouldn\u2019t arrive until 2021, before finally saying in May that it was being shelved for the foreseeable future.\n Major updates to Windows 10 have also been delayed in the past, with the Windows 10 October 2018 Update only   starting its automatic rollout in January 2019.\n The safe bet would probably be for Windows 11 to arrive sometime between September and December. Microsoft will likely release Preview Builds before then, however, so those curious about the future of Windows should probably sign up for the  Windows Insider Program if they\u2019re comfortable using unstable software.\n After its release date is revealed, the next question would be how Windows users will be able to upgrade to it. Will it be a free update, or will it follow previous versions of the operating system by involving some kind of upgrade fee? The leaked build of Windows 11  suggests it will be the former, with configuration keys reportedly indicating that Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 users might be able to upgrade for free. (Presumably that free upgrade path would also be available to Windows 10 users.)\n  Microsoft plans to reveal Windows 11 \u2014 or at least the update everyone has taken to calling Windows 11 \u2014 during the \u201cWhat\u2019s Next for Windows\u201d virtual event on June 24 at 11 a.m. ET. \u00a0Microsoft will livestream the even   on its website and has designated &#34;#MicrosoftEvent&#34; for use on social media.\n      I think you can add  two   leakers claiming Microsoft  is internally developing Windows 11. Whether &#34;11&#34; is a code name or a marketing name seems to be the question now.  In the end, it&#39;s Panos Panay: the guy will trip if Windows doesn&#39;t get the &#34;pumped&#34; hype he so desperately wants. Look at how they marketed the now-cancelled 10X: &#34;a revolution!&#34;  Android 12, iOS 15, MacOS 12, Chrome OS 91 (and 92 and 93 and 94), etc., Microsoft looks ancient with Windows 10. Why does this matter? PC hardware OEMs   need new marketing OS versions to sell to mainstream consumers, businesses, etc.\n   Reply\n I think you can add  two  leakers claiming Microsoft  is internally developing Windows 11.

The idea that Windows is suddently going to fundamentally change how we interact with our PCs while running Win32 software is debatable.... because we know how many Metro/Modern/UWP productivity apps Microsoft released for Windows.  Do you know... if you click on a photo in File Manager, Display it with the Photos App, Decide you like to Email it someone... so You select Share To... and you are looking for Microsoft Outlook which is part of your Ofice 365 subscription..... uhhhh.. It don&#39;t work... funny... I can do that with my android phone (Outlook for Android will even prompt me to reduce the file size). Windows, File Manager, Photos and Outlook are from the same company and their isn&#39;t a seemless way to share.....  When I see that my wife, who is not as computer saavy as me, cannot accomplish things like this easily... I question if anyone in Redmond is even paying attention to users at all..... The only thing revolutionary about the next version of WIndows is that it will be monotized through subscription services, just like Azure and Office... I don&#39;t know even know why I&#39;m posting this... no one cares....\n   Reply\n The Windows Store and XBox should be removed from Windows entirely but I doubt MS will do that.

This is the first release of a 64-bit Visual Studio and we\u2019d love for you to download it, try it out, and join us in shaping the next major release of Visual Studio with your feedback.\n   Our key goal with this preview is to test and tune the scalability of the new 64-bit platform! With the new 64-bit platform Visual Studio is now capable of scaling to make use of all the system resources you have to improve the reliability of Visual Studio especially when working with complex solutions or using Visual Studio over long periods of time. The 64-bit conversion effort affects every part of Visual Studio, so the scope is much bigger than our usual previews.\n We know that you expect quality, stability, and scalability from Visual Studio. And to be totally transparent, the quickest way for us to get there is when real developers like you tell us where we can improve. We really do pay attention to every bug report, suggestion, and upvote! Which you can submit from inside Visual Studio via  report a problem.\n  The Visual Studio 2022 previews can be installed side-by-side with earlier versions of Visual Studio, are available in all three editions (Community, Pro, and Enterprise), and are free to use.\n  We encourage you to try out the preview and use it just like Visual Studio 2019. We appreciate your time in providing feedback and completing in-product surveys, which are invaluable in making Visual Studio 2022 the best developer environment for you.\n We would particularly love to hear about your experiences working with very large and complex solutions in Visual Studio 2022. Before the 64-bit upgrade, customers with this kind of solution would sometimes experience issues with Visual Studio as it ran out of memory to use in the main 32-bit process. During early testing of Visual Studio 2022, the same customers were able to run the IDE for days,  even with solutions containing 700 (or more!) projects.\n  Because most of the Preview 1 upgrades have to do with 64-bit support, we\u2019ll be releasing an exciting slate of new features and performance improvements starting in Preview 2. You can read all about those upcoming features on the  Visual Studio roadmap. One new feature you can try right away is the  update to IntelliCode \u2013 you can automatically complete code, up to a whole line at a time.\n There\u2019s still some work left in moving Visual Studio to 64-bit, and a small number of the features in Visual Studio 2019 are not included in Visual Studio 2022 Preview 1. You can find a list of those upcoming features in the  release notes.\n During the Visual Studio 2022 preview, our partners who build the extensions that you use and love will be working to update their extensions. While they do that, their extensions won\u2019t be available in Visual Studio 2022 right away.\n The first preview of Visual Studio 2022 for Mac will be coming soon, giving you a first look at the new modern macOS UI for Visual Studio. We still have some work to do before we feel it\u2019s ready for developer feedback and we\u2019ll keep you updated on its progress here on the  Visual Studio blog.\n  If you make extensions, we want to help you get your extensions into Visual Studio 2022. To get you started, check out our guide to   migrating your extensions to Preview 1.\n Also!

Thousands of subscribers depend on LWN for the best news from the Linux and free software communities. If you enjoy this article, please consider  subscribing to LWN. Thank youfor visiting LWN.net!\n Free-software development is meant to be fun, at least some of the time.Even developers of database-management systems seem to think that it isfun; there is no accounting for taste, it seems. Part of having fun iscertainly allowing the occasional exercise of one&#39;s sense of humor whileworking on the code. But, as some recent &#34;fix&#34; attempts show, humor doesnot always carry through to developers all over the planet. Balancinghumor and inclusiveness is always going to be a challenge for our community. There is  afunction in the kernel scheduler that will, if things go badly wrong,inform users that a bug is present, describing it as &#34; arch topologyborken&#34;. The message is, of course, breathtaking in its clarity;users will immediately know what to do when they see it. Recently, though,a well-intentioned developer  senta patch changing the message to read &#34;broken&#34; instead. This patch was notaccepted, but it did result in a brief discussion explaining the nature ofthe intended joke to the submitter. The following day, somebody else attempted to fix  anotherscheduler function containing a comment that cites &#34; histericalraisins&#34;. This time, the poster was  instructedto search for &#34;humour&#34;, which is rather less illuminating. Other examplesabound; one of the more amusing such attempts came last year, when a developer  concludedthat the title of  thisdocument required a spelling correction; the  responsethis time politely declined the patch, but encouraged the poster by saying&#34; rest assured that you did get [the] point!&#34;. Anybody who has spent any amount of time trying to function in a non-nativelanguage understands that humor can be difficult. It is deeply tied toboth the language it is expressed in and the specific context where it isfound. Words that fluent speakers find funny can simply fly over thehead of those who are less proficient, and attempts to be funny in anon-native language do not always go well. Your editor has a hard timegetting a laugh from native English speakers; he has learned that it&#39;s better notto even try in other settings. Source code is meant to be precise and understandable. Comments are thereto help when the code itself is not enough to explain why a particularaction is taken. When those comments contain plays on words, creativemisspellings, or jargon-laden inside jokes, they will become less clear topeople who may be struggling to understand even plainly written English.Such readers will trip over the language in question, and some of themmay then be moved to try to &#34;fix&#34; it. The result is a certain amount ofconfusion and lost time. One possible solution could be to eliminate this kind of play on words asan impediment to global free-software development. As Zhen Lei  saidin the first discussion linked above: &#34; Linux is an open-sourcecode for the world, so it&#39;s better to use a more common word.&#34; Ifwe stuck with common words, we would see less confusion, fewer &#34;fixes&#34; forintentional humor, and possibly better participation overall. But, remember, free-software development is supposed to be fun as well asuseful; that is part of why many of us got into it in the first place.Turning a free-software project into a humor-free zone would make itdistinctly less fun, which could be seen as an inclusiveness problem in itsown right. The cure could be far worse than the disease. Fortunately, nobody is proposing any such thing. Most of us are agreedthat life can only be improved by something that brings a little smile inthe middle of an extensive code-reading session. With any luck at all, ourcode will continue to acquire the occasional comment that makes it clearthat we do not take ourselves too seriously. But that means we will also continue to receive the occasional &#34;fix&#34; fromreaders who were unable to appreciate a humorous turn of phrase and wish tostraighten it out in some way. Those will be the best occasions of all todemonstrate that, indeed, we do not take ourselves too seriously. A curtresponse from a developer who clearly feels that their time is being wastedmay turn away an aspiring contributor who we would much rather keep. Akind response, explaining the phrasing in question, will help thatcontributor appreciate the humor, improve their language skills, and getthem to the point where, someday, they will embed some humor in useful codeof their own. Others, silently watching the conversation, may alsobenefit.  For better or worse, English is the language of the free-softwaredevelopment community. English is not the native language of amajority of our contributors, though, and some of those contributors willstruggle with itat times. But, with some patience, we can have our code and laugh at ittoo.         ( Log in to post comments)\n  When I saw the title of this post, I was afraid it would be about racist, sexist, or political jokes. I was quite relieved to see it was about good old fashioned UNIX Dad Jokes.\n The offensiveness of my comments depends entirely on what kind of project it is. If it&#39;s professional, you can expect to see a little cursing and my usual cynicism, but nothing too edgy. If it&#39;s open source, I have code that instructs readers to perform analingus on me and/or their grandmother if, per chance, they dislike and/or wish to change a particular section of code.  Does it disturb people? Sure. But, abhorrent humor is an integral part of who I am, and I am a true believer in The Satanic Temple&#39;s 4th tenet: &#34;The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one&#39;s own.&#34;  Similar reasons are why I refuse to follow language-specific style guides much of the time, particularly Rust&#39;s, because the compiler attempts to enforce it with a warning, which I find, ironically, very offensive.\n Funny. Got me going there for a while. Granted, the smug self righteous programmer stereotype is getting a bit long in the tooth.\n  Posted Jun 12, 2021 1:11 UTC (Sat) by  Cyberax ( \u272d supporter \u272d, #52523) [ Link]\n Well, it might have been a good joke to someone who didn&#39;t need the explanation... but once you have to explain it, it&#39;s ruined.\n  That&#39;s silly. I doubt there&#39;s a single joke understood by everybody, which would mean there are no jokes at all.\n &gt; Fart jokes are pretty universal  They&#39;re certainly widespread:  &gt; The world\u2019s oldest joke is revealed to be an ancient Sumerian proverb dating back to 1900 BC - Something which has never occurred since time immemorial; a young woman did not fart in her husband\u2019s lap.  ( https://www.wlv.ac.uk/news-and-events/latest-news/2008/au...), though I feel like in this case some of the humour may still have been lost in translation.\n It&#39;s not presented in a particularly clear way: I was still waiting for the proverb to begin by the time I was half-way through reading it. That&#39;s even before you consider the double negative (which I&#39;d assume is half the joke).\n  Honestly, I never found fart jokes funny. People have tried to explain to me why they did find them funny, but even with the explanation I&#39;ve never had a moment where I was like &#34;oh yeah, that makes some sense&#34;, which I usually have when it comes to other jokes I don&#39;t get immediately.  I&#39;m not saying this to argue whether fart jokes are actually funny or not, because I don&#39;t think there&#39;s an objective answer to that; I just want to provide another data point that humor is very subjective and therefore agree very much with the sentiment that there are no universal jokes.\n  Posted Jun 13, 2021 7:11 UTC (Sun) by  Cyberax ( \u272d supporter \u272d, #52523) [ Link]\n Granted. The question was whether there was anything that could be universally understood, though, not universally appreciated.\n  My brother told about a time some year back he was in Sudan, completely lost. He was looking for a certain primary school. This was quite a dangerous area to drive around in because there were no roads but there were lots of old landmines and other unexploded ordinance.  They arrived at a village, but no one had a shared language. So they&#39;re trying to for directions to the school through pantomime.  They weren&#39;t making any progress until this two year old kid comes up. This kid is not wearing a stitch of clothing. The kid farts and wanders away nonchalantly. Everyone falls apart laughing. Universal humor.\n  Even amongst native English speakers, words can vary in meaning (&amp; offensiveness.) In the UK, &#34;Going for a fag&#34; is quite innocuos (&#34;I&#39;m going to smoke a cigarette&#34;). But I believe in the USA that phrase can mean something quite different. The phrase &#34;Two countries separated by a common language&#34; is often used to describe the differences between the UK &amp; USA.  Culture &amp; context are so important in language (&amp; humour) and it&#39;s very hard for humour to travel - just ask any professional comedian. Then, when you add into the mix that many people aren&#39;t native speakers of English and trying to understand this sutble word-play, it gets even harder.  Words&#39; meaning &amp; culture change over time and at different speeds in different countries. Going back to my example, &#34;fag&#34; used to be a homophobic slur in the UK but now it&#39;s just slang for cigarrette* whereas in the USA I believe it still maintains the homophobic connotations.  And this cultural context issue don&#39;t just apply to words. In many parts of the world, the thumbs up Emoji means &#34;OK&#34; or &#34;Good&#34;. In some parts of the world, this emoji is deeply offensive. We&#39;ve had support tickets asking us to remove the thumbs up emoji from systems because of its offensiveness.  TL;DR Writing for an international audience is very hard and humour is an order of magnitude harder.   * - Fag, in the UK, also has other meanings but it&#39;s mostly used to refer to cigarettes.\n &gt; Going back to my example, &#34;fag&#34; used to be a homophobic slur in the UK but now it&#39;s just slang for cigarrette* whereas in the USA I believe it still maintains the homophobic connotations.  It&#39;s complicated and depends on who you ask.  In general, it is a slur in US English, and will not be understood* to mean &#34;cigarette.&#34; In some circles, there have been attempts to reclaim it in various ways (most of which keep the base meaning of &#34;a homosexual man&#34; but seek to change the connotations). Not everyone agrees that this is desirable or practical.** Regardless, it should never be used as a pejorative, and it&#39;s probably unwise to use it in any context where it might be mistaken for a pejorative. I would also respectfully suggest that straight people may want to steer clear of this discourse, unless they are deeply involved with LGBTQ+ activism and have a thorough understanding of all of the relevant issues.***  * Unless the listener or reader recognizes that you&#39;re not speaking US English in the first place. ** This is mostly because it&#39;s still used pejoratively by some (small but extremely vocal) groups in the US. Many people still have strong negative feelings about this word because it was wielded against them in childhood or sometimes adulthood, and in many cases this is only one part of a broad campaign of physical or emotional abuse. *** Look, if you want to put your foot in your mouth, nobody is going to stop you. But we&#39;re also not going to give you a break for being ignorant. If you deliberately jump in at the deep end, you are expected to know how to swim.\n  Going back to my example, &#34;fag&#34; used to be a homophobic slur in the UK but now it&#39;s just slang for cigarrette* whereas in the USA I believe it still maintains the homophobic connotations.\nA word of caution in case anyone not well versed in British English takes this as gospel and attempts to employ it in practice - this is  highly context dependent. Don&#39;t try to be clever about using this word in the UK. If you use it in a context where &#34;cigarette&#34; is a good-faith interpretation of the word, that&#39;s how people will interpret it. But the slur form is also well understood and used (either as a slur or as a reclaimed word).\n Yeah, &#34;now it&#39;s just slang for cigarette&#34; implies that if you were to tell somebody they &#34;look like a fag&#34; you&#39;d just be suggesting they resemble a cigarette (tall and thin maybe?) and that&#39;s not what you&#39;ll be doing at all.\n  Since a cigarette is something you burn, could the use of fag to mean cigarette be, in fact, homophobic?\n Practically? Possibly.  It appears the etymology&#39;s independent. Having poked around on en.wiktionary.org:  The &#34;gay man&#34; usage is a contraction of &#34;faggot&#34;, which as well as meaning &#34;bundle of sticks&#34;, &#34;bundle of metal rods&#34;, &#34;burning ember&#34;, and &#34;English meatball&#34; also came to mean &#34;shrewish woman&#34; and later (I dare say by extension of the &#34;shrewish woman&#34; sense, with some possible influence from a Yiddish term &#34;feygele&#34; which means &#34;little bird&#34;, &#34;loved one&#34;, and (offensively) &#34;homosexual man&#34;) came to mean &#34;homosexual and/or effeminate man&#34;.  The &#34;cigarette&#34; usage appears to me to be likely to be a back-construction from using &#34;fag-end&#34; (a very old term meaning &#34;remnant or worst portion&#34;, etymologically distinct from the above) to refer to the unsmoked remnant of a cigarette.\n  As a student of various languages, though, I can tell you that when you are finally able to \u201cget\u201d jokes in your non-native language, it\u2019s glorious. We shouldn\u2019t deprive people of that joy, even if it does cause the occasional inconvenience.   The miscommunications will happen anyway in a diverse environment. It\u2019s much better if we can learn to laugh at them instead of automatically taking offense.\n  This do remind me of the &#34;printer on fire&#34; message debate. I seem to remember that it was reworded a while ago.\n &gt; I seem to remember that it was reworded a while ago.  Unfortunately not.  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/li...  But I guess that preservation of a \u201cwOw So RaNdUm\u201d joke was more important than writing actually useful error messages. Priorities.\n As the person who initially added that particular message about thirty years ago, I&#39;ll say that I also thought it had been replaced with something like &#34;lp%d unknown error (on fire, eh?)&#34; to preserve a bad joke while being unlikely to freak people out.  I&#39;d fully support removing all reference to fire, but at this point, who even has a parallel port any more? If a joke falls flat in a forest, and there is no one around to hear it, does it matter that no one laughed at it?\n Times change, maybe we could preserve this particular joke as a deadpan line in the USB4 stack...\n  Once I have tried iff ==&gt; if (not a humor, though), but had been told the difference. After that I rather don\u2019t fix anything than very obvious typos.\n &gt; Once I have tried iff ==&gt; if  Even in academia &#34;iff&#34; is not always known to everybody. If your target audience consists of mathematicians, philosophers, theoretical physicists and/or some subset of computer scientists, you may be able to use it without explanation. But even when writing a scientific paper to wider audience (fields outside of those mentioned), it is considered good form to either always expand it to &#34;if and only if&#34;, or at the very least to define the abbreviation at it&#39;s first usage in the paper.  In code, where typos are vastly more common than scientific notation, I would always want to avoid &#34;iff&#34;. Because either it doesn&#39;t matter that the reverse arrow is also true in that comment, and then you can just use a plain &#34;if&#34;, or it does matter, and then &#34;if and only if&#34; is so much clearer to everyone.  I&#39;d maybe think differently about this if the abbreviation for &#34;if and only if&#34; were some word that wasn&#39;t so close to a typo that people who didn&#39;t understand it would at least think of putting it into a search engine. For example, in German, &#34;if and only if&#34; is &#34;genau dann, wenn&#34; while a plain &#34;if&#34; is &#34;wenn&#34; -- so people sometimes use &#34;gdw&#34; as an abbreviation. But Germans who&#39;ve never heard of &#34;gdw&#34; won&#39;t mistake it for a different German word, because it&#39;s not that close to anything that it could be a typo, so they&#39;ll probably put it into a search engine. People who&#39;ve never heard of &#34;iff&#34;, on the other hand, will most definitely think that it&#39;s just a typo for &#34;if&#34; -- native speaker or not.\n I always seen the similarity of &#34;iff&#34; to &#34;if&#34; more as an advantage, especially when it is used carefully. I agree that when the difference really matters, &#34;if and only if&#34; is much cleaner, but often is doesn&#39;t matter and is more of an additional remark. Then using &#34;iff&#34; adds a small bit of additional context for everyone who understands it, while the important part is still perfectly readable for everyone else (even if it looks like a typo).\n  My granddad once complained to me about the quality of language in newspapers these days, eg, an article that said something was becoming &#34;curiouser and curiouser&#34;. I had to explain that was a quote from Alice in Wonderland. But in an international context, one must accept that misspellings have limited scope for humour.   I have come across &#34;borken&#34; but it&#39;s more commonly &#34;borked&#34;; as for &#34;histerical raisins&#34;, ESR&#39;s jargon file spells it &#34;hysterical&#34; (a play on &#34;historical reasons&#34;, which I didn&#39;t know), and I don&#39;t see the humour in the additional misspelling of &#34;histerical&#34;.   In short: most of this &#34;humour&#34; is lame anyway. There&#39;s no harm in fixing it!\n I suggest we create a focus group for the removal of Lame And Useless, Gratuitous Humour\n   And so is yours.  Neither of you is &#34;right&#34; or &#34;wrong&#34;. You both just have different opinions on the subject.\n I agree, and I also think that removing humor for being lame, it&#39;s not a good reason, because someone had to judge if someone else humour is lame or not, but there is no objective rules for lameness in humour. Some jokes resonate with some reader and not with someone else, but this is not a reason per se to avoid it.  I suspect that humour is like beauty, it is in the eye of the beholder.\n  &gt; In short: most of this &#34;humour&#34; is lame anyway. There&#39;s no harm in fixing it!  Basically this. Most of the \u201chacker humour\u201d is _painfully_ unfunny, and that includes all of examples in the article. It was maybe funny back in the 80s, but in 2021? It\u2019s just cringy.\n   For many applications all you would need is an additional &#34;translation&#34; that can replace the message as needed.\n  &gt; and I don&#39;t see the humour in the additional misspelling of &#34;histerical&#34;  Because actually histerical is closer to the &#34;correct&#34; &#34;historical&#34;. It&#39;s only one letter wrong, not two.\n  I like the practice used in printing of adding &#34;(sic)&#34;, with or without an exclamation mark, to make it clear that this is indeed intended.

The platform includes smart annotation capabilities to automatically label the different data points so the neural network can play with millions of potential situations, achieving similar performance to the edge device that\u2019s in the field with real-world environmental conditions, according to Makani.\n A 2020 McKinsey study  predicted the freight industry is not likely to see the kind of YOY growth it saw last year, which was 30% up from 2019, but noted that some industries would increase at higher rates than others. For example, commodities related to e-commerce and agricultural and food products will be the first to return to growth, whereas electronics and automotive might increase at a slower rate due to declining consumer demand for nonessentials.\n Since the pandemic, the company said it experienced 70% annualized growth, in large part due to expansion into new markets like construction, oil and gas, food and beverage, field services, moving and storage and agriculture. KeepTruckin expects this demand to increase and intends to use the fresh funds to scale rapidly and recruit more talent that will help progress its AI systems, doubling  its R&amp;D team to 700 people globally with a focus on engineering, machine vision, data science and other AI areas, says Makani.\n \u201cWe think packaging these products into operator-friendly user interfaces for people who are not deeply technical is critical, so front-end and full-stack engineers with experience building incredibly intuitive mobile and web applications are also high priority,\u201d said Makani.\n Much of KeepTruckin\u2019s tech will eventually power autonomous vehicles to make roads safer, says Makani, something that\u2019s also becoming increasingly relevant as  the   demand for trucking continues to outpace supply of drivers.\n \u201c Level 4 and eventually level 5 autonomy will come to the trucking industry, but we are still many years away from broad deployment,\u201d he said. \u201cOur AI-powered dashcam is making drivers safer and helping prevent accidents today. While the promise of autonomy is real, we are working hard to help companies realize the value of this technology now.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-18 06:47:25", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "ai,invest,makani", "title": "Leadtruckin\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e861.9\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u4e8eAI\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u53cc\u4eba\u7814\u53d1\u56e2\u961f\u5230700 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tKeepTruckin raises $190 million to invest in AI products, double R&D team to 700\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/keeptruckin-raises-190-million-to-invest-in-ai-products-double-rd-team-to-700/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["ai", "invest", "makani"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "83c9aa704ad7937aa427815d4d8395eb.jpg", "infoid": 1066607, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u201c\u5728Spotify\u4e0a\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u6295\u8d44\u5e76\u89c4\u6a21\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u597d\u7684\uff08\u548c\u6700\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\uff09\u64ad\u5ba2\u53d1\u73b0\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u201d\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0cPodz\u7684\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u8865\u5145\u548c\u52a0\u901fSpotify\u7684\u91cd\u70b9\u52aa\u529b\u63a8\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u9002\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5feb\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u589e\u957f\u3002\u201d\n \u7531\u4e8e\u64ad\u5ba2\u5f80\u5f80\u662f30\u5206\u949f\u7684\u64ad\u97f3\uff0c\u4f46\u542c\u4f17\u6d4f\u89c8\u65b0\u8282\u76ee\u5f88\u96be -

So, Podz developed what it called \u201cthe first audio newsfeed,\u201d presenting users with 60-second clips from various shows. Podcasters often use apps like  Headliner to create clips to promote on their social media accounts, and Podz follows the same idea. But instead of podcasters manually choosing how to promote their show, Podz chooses a clip using its machine learning model, which was trained on more than 100,000 hours of audio in consultation with journalists and audio editors.\n   Before its acquisition by Spotify, Podz raised $2.5 million in pre-seed funding from M13, Canaan Partners, Charge Ventures, and Humbition. Celebrities like Katie Couric and Paris Hilton also invested.\n \u201cAlready, the average podcast listener subscribes to seven podcasts but follows almost 30 on Podz,\u201d M13 General Partner Latif Peracha  told TechCrunch via email in February. \u201cEarly signals make us optimistic the team can build a transformative product in the category.\u201d\n This acquisition marks yet another sign of Spotify\u2019s ambition to corner the podcasting market, and audio entertainment in general \u2013 just yesterday, Spotify debuted  Greenroom, its live audio Clubhouse rival. And when it comes to driving revenue from podcast subscriptions, Spotify and Apple are neck and neck. In April,  Apple announced its expansion into podcast subscriptions, and the following week, Spotify began rolling out its subscription platform  after teasing it in February. Apple said it will take 30% of podcast revenue in the first year, which will drop to 15% in the second. On the other hand, Spotify\u2019s program won\u2019t take any cut from creators until 2023, when it will take 5%.\n Though podcast creators can quickly determine that it might prove more beneficial to surrender 5% of their subscription earnings than 30%, listeners will likely just flock to whatever app provides the best user experience \u2013 and if Spotify\u2019s investment in discovery pays off, it could pose trouble for Apple\u2019s longstanding dominance in the podcasting medium.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 06:47:12", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u64ad\u5ba2,\u6536\u8d2d,acquires", "title": "Spotify\u6536\u8d2dPodz\uff0c\u64ad\u5ba2\u53d1\u73b0\u5e73\u53f0 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tSpotify acquires Podz, a podcast discovery platform\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/spotify-acquires-podz-a-podcast-discovery-app/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u64ad\u5ba2", "\u6536\u8d2d", "acquires"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5522040a4eb59b1e54a95c0ded58c127.jpg", "infoid": 1066606, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u902e\u6355\u6807\u5fd7\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u6267\u6cd5\u673a\u6784\u5ba3\u5e03\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u902e\u6355\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u4ea7\u9ed1\u5ba2\u96c6\u56e2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u5bc6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u5a01\u80c1\u8981\u5c06\u5176\u6cc4\u9732\u7ed9\u516c\u4f17\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u800c\u5d4c\u5165\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u3002\n   \u8be5\u56e2\u4f19\u79f0\u4e3aCL0P\uff0c\u5df2\u9ed1\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u7f8e\u56fd\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8fc8\u963f\u5bc6\u5927\u5b66\uff0c\u4f5b\u7f57\u91cc\u8fbe\u5dde\u4f5b\u7f57\u91cc\u8fbe\u5dde\u65af\u5766\u798f\u5927\u5b66\uff0c\u9a6c\u91cc\u5170\u5927\u5b66\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u79d1\u7f57\u62c9\u591a\u5927\u5b66\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u652f\u4ed8\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u529f\u80fd\u6216\u4e0d\u516c\u5e03\u7269\u8d28\u80fd\u591f\u5077\u7a83\u3002\n \u7531\u4e8e\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5a01\u80c1\u5230\u5371\u53ca\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7684\u9ad8\u8c03\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u8427\u6761\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u6084\u7136\u666e\u904d\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u51fa\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6084\u7136\u666e\u904d\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n  \u4e4c\u514b\u5170\uff06\uff0339;

Biden  is expected to press Putin to take action against ransomware hackers who operate with impunity within Russia&#39;s borders.\n Ransomware has become a significant problem in the United States. Recent ransomware attacks briefly hobbled the Colonial Pipeline, shutting down the country&#39;s largest fuel pipeline for five days, and JBS, one of the country&#39;s largest meat suppliers.\n  The majority of the most prolific ransomware gangs are believed to operate in Eastern Europe, and Russia in particular.\n Ukraine&#39;s cyber police announced they had arrested six people involved with Cl0p, and seized a number of computers, cars and about 5 million Ukrainian hryvnia ($185,000) in cash.\n   A video released by Ukrainian authorities showed heavily armed officers descending on what appeared to be residences and seizing everything from stacks of cash and computers to luxury cars.\n Though Cl0p wasn&#39;t the most prolific ransomware gang, it still hacked dozens of targets, mostly in the U.S. and South Korea, since becoming operational in the summer of 2020, said Allan Liska, a ransomware analyst at the cybersecurity company Recorded Future.\n  &#34;While they weren\u2019t considered a top-tier ransomware actor, their methods were fairly sophisticated,&#34; he said.\n Interpol, the international police organization, which often helps with cybercrime investigations, said it assisted with the case, a spokesperson said in an email.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 06:40:16", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5e2e\u5e2e,bust,\u7f8e\u56fd",

", "note_en": "In a bid to bolster its claims as a crime-fighting tool, Ring deployed a tactic popular in the business world: influencer marketing. It selected a cadre of brand ambassadors, rewarded them with free gadgets and discount codes, and urged them to use their connections to promote the Santa Monica security camera startup via word of mouth.\n  \u201cYou are killing it, by the way. Your code has 14 uses, eleven more and I will be sending you every device that we sell,\u201d a Ring employee wrote to one officer in a 2016 email. \u201cDo you have any community meetings or crime prevention fairs coming up?\u201d\n Ring provided at least 100 LAPD officers with one or more free devices or discount codes and encouraged them to recommend the company\u2019s web-connected doorbells and security cameras, emails reviewed by The Times reveal. In more than 15 cases, emails show that officers who received free gadgets or discounts promoted Ring products to fellow police officers or members of the public.\n  For Ring, turning police into brand ambassadors helped spur the adoption of Ring doorbells while lending credibility to the company\u2019s claims that it was an effective crime-reduction solution.\n In return, participating officers got tens of thousands of dollars worth of free and discounted electronics and helped establish a network of personal surveillance cameras that the LAPD could tap into with much less red tape than the typical means of obtaining video footage.\n The practice, privacy and criminal justice experts warn, raises the question of whether LAPD officers were serving the public in their interactions with Ring, or if they were serving a private business and themselves.\n LAPD rules restrict the acceptance of gifts that could be seen as an attempt to influence the actions of officers. After a preliminary review of the emails, the department said officers did not appear to have violated agency rules.\n  An agency spokesperson said that although accepting free devices and personally recommending those products to community members did not violate the LAPD code of ethics, a paid endorsement would run afoul of agency rules.\n \u201cOf course, each situation is looked at on a case by case basis,\u201d Det. Meghan Aguilar, a spokesperson for the LAPD, said in a statement. \u201cIf there is something brought to the department\u2019s attention which appears to be misconduct, it will be referred to Professional Standards Bureau for investigation.\u201d\n It\u2019s unclear whether LAPD officers disclosed their arrangements with Ring to the public or fellow officers.\n Ring ended its law enforcement ambassador program, called Pillar, in 2019 and now works directly with community organizations, said Emma Daniels, a spokesperson for Ring, which Amazon acquired in 2018.\n  \u201cRing stopped donating to law enforcement and encouraging police to promote our products years ago,\u201d Daniels said in a statement. \u201cAs Ring has grown, our practices have evolved, and we are always looking for ways to better serve our customers and their communities.\u201d\n The Times reached out to each officer named in this story directly or through the union and the Police Department and did not receive any response by the time of publication.\n Tony Cheng, an assistant professor at UC Irvine\u2019s Department of Criminology, Law and Society, warned that the public probably would be unable to make a distinction between a personal recommendation from an officer who received a free or discounted Ring product and a paid endorsement. \u201cThat seems to be splitting hairs,\u201d Cheng said.\n The practice, he said, is a cause for concern both substantively and symbolically \u2014 freebies from private companies could give officers motives other than public service, and they could give the public the impression that recommendations from officers can\u2019t be trusted.\n  \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be put in the position to have to question or be skeptical about the quality of public safety advice that they\u2019re giving out in meetings, for example, which could be compromised by these private partnerships,\u201d Cheng said.\n  The brand ambassador model is simple. Give free merchandise to influential individuals, and turn them into a low-cost marketing team.\n Some brands court celebrities with huge followings; others look to people who aren\u2019t necessarily famous yet have influence in their own communities. A makeup artist with a social media presence might receive swag for posting about new eyeshadow palettes. A runner might get free shoes for talking about footwear on Facebook. And stylish Instagram users might land freebies if their feed has the right look.\n It\u2019s less common, however, for public servants to participate in the brand ambassador model.\n  Ring began its outreach to the LAPD during a period of growth. Founded in the Pacific Palisades garage of Jamie Siminoff in 2012, Ring was proving wrong critics who had doubted the startup during an appearance on the TV show \u201cShark Tank.\u201d As e-commerce took off and concerns about porch theft rose with it, consumers embraced Ring and other video doorbells. By 2016, the company had an estimated $155 million in sales, commanding 80% of the global video doorbell market. It was valued at $460 million, had amassed $209 million in venture capital funding and Siminoff, at the time, was eyeing a potential initial public offering of stock.\n  But Ring wasn\u2019t profitable. The company was also having  trouble proving definitively that its products helped reduce crime in neighborhoods \u2014 a marketing promise it sought to validate by working with the LAPD, among other police departments.\n Emails from 2016 reviewed by The Times and released via a public records request show that Ring deployed a standard playbook as it approached officers across LAPD stations.\n  Often, Ring would make contact with an officer at an event or through introductions from fellow police. Then came a follow-up, with a request for a phone call to discuss ways to \u201creduce crime\u201d in their neighborhoods. Finally, Ring thanked the officer for the call and said a free product was on its way.\n In at least 24 cases, Ring emailed a discount code and encouraged an officer to share it with colleagues, prominent local individuals such as heads of neighborhood associations and residents of the communities they police.\n Ring\u2019s goal when sending free devices to officers was to let them experience it so they could \u201cspread the word about how this doorbell is proven to reduce crime in neighborhoods, spreading the word to HOA\u2019s, meeting groups, on Nextdoor, and at public safety meetings,\u201d one email from the company read.\n The LAPD\u2019s  code of ethics prohibits officers from accepting \u201cany gifts, gratuities or favors of any kind which might reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to influence their actions with respect to City business\u201d or using \u201ctheir position to secure directly or indirectly unwarranted privileges or exemptions for themselves or others.\u201d\n  The LAPD said using discount codes is \u201cgenerally not in conflict with our Code of Ethics.\u201d Aguilar also said recommending ways for community members to protect themselves is among the responsibilities of senior lead officers or officers in community relations positions \u2014 titles held by some of the officers named in this story who accepted free or discounted devices.\n  Although it\u2019s common for community members to ask officers for recommendations, Cheng, the UC Irvine professor, argues it\u2019s up to the officer to \u201cexercise restraint, according to the code of ethics.\u201d Officers could recommend security systems broadly, said Cheng, who reviewed some of the emails and pointed out that officers didn\u2019t just answer questions about recommendations, but proactively steered the public toward Ring.\n Ring quickly made inroads in the department, communicating with at least 125 officers in 2016.\n  In April of that year, after hearing about arrangements Ring made with other members of the LAPD, Officer Eric Mollinedo from the Olympic division emailed Ring\u2019s director of operations, August Cziment, asking for promo codes as well as information about receiving a unit for his home. Mollinedo said he\u2019d be manning a booth at an upcoming public safety fair. Cziment said Ring would get him \u201cgoing with flyers, as well as a unit.\u201d Ring also provided Mollinedo a coupon code and encouraged him to distribute it to his colleagues.\n After the fair, Mollinedo emailed Ring to let the company know the event was a success. \u201cWas a good day today at the Public Safety fair ... talked up Ring and had (5) officers/reserve officers purchase them!\u201d\n In at least 10 cases, officers invited Ring to community events or offered to schedule meetings at their stations primarily for the purpose of allowing company representatives to talk up products and hand out discount codes.\n That same month, Sgt. Justin Scott exchanged a series of emails with Cziment about an offer for a free stick-up camera. Ring asked him to share the offer with his entire West L.A. station. Scott agreed, saying he\u2019d keep the option to sign up for the free camera open for a month, and in that same message asked if he could get a replacement for a friend\u2019s Ring device \u201cthat appears defective.\u201d\n  Later that month, Scott ran promotional language by the company before sending it to fellow officers, emailing Cziment a block of text about the stick-up camera offer for his approval. Cziment replied, \u201cLooks great! Keep me updated on how it all goes.\u201d\n Of the 60 officers who responded to Scott\u2019s email asking for a free stick-up camera, four asked if they could also receive the Ring doorbell that the company gave out for free months prior because they had missed the opportunity at that time. At least three others asked for free stick-up cameras for other officers who didn\u2019t sign up in time. One asked for discounts for family members.\n At the time, the device retailed for $199, amounting to a conservative estimate of at least $12,000 in free hardware doled out at just one station.\n Requests for freebies kept coming. In one case, Officer Maria Gray, who was among the West L.A. police to receive a free stick-up camera, emailed Cziment to invite him to an upcoming station family picnic.\n  \u201cWe have a favor to ask... Every year, we have a West LA Division Beach party.... We use our measly station fund and buy some gifts to raffle off as prizes. Without me asking, do you see where I\u2019m going with this email? More importantly, we\u2019d love for you to come and attend. Bring some friends, our treat.\u201d\n Cziment wrote: \u201cWe\u2019d be happy to donate a Ring Doorbell and perhaps a new Solar Powered Security sign if that\u2019s of interest? :)\u201d\n Police invitations also extended to the top of the company: Siminoff, Ring\u2019s chief executive, attended a 2016 police academy graduation as a guest of then-LAPD Chief Charlie Beck.\n  Ring also encouraged officers to promote its products to residents of the communities they policed. The goal was to \u201cspread the word about how this doorbell is proven to reduce crime in neighborhoods,\u201d read one email from Ring offering a free device for an officer to try in his home.\n  Ring asked officers to help with its \u201cNeighborhood Pillar\u201d program, enlisting its LAPD contacts to \u201ceducate members of the community on the benefits of Ring\u201d by handing out promo codes and fliers to so-called pillars \u2014 \u201cinfluential people in the community that care about crime prevention safety.\u201d For every 10 uses of the code, the pillar would get a free Ring device.\n Community members Ring considered \u201cinfluential\u201d included neighborhood watch captains or presidents, one email showed. If the officers didn\u2019t know anyone who fit the bill, Ring invited the officers to take on the role of the pillar.\n  In an April 2016 email, Officer Evening Wight said a sergeant in her station had given her permission to share a Ring promo code, but \u201cshe cautioned me to word the email so that it won\u2019t appear that we are endorsing the product, merely offering it as an option among others for home security.\u201d\n  In a May 2016 email, Officer Javier Segovia said his sergeant and captain wanted Ring representative Phillip Dienstag to talk about Ring at an upcoming community meeting. But Segovia \u2014 who according to the emails had days prior received and installed a free Ring doorbell \u2014 advised that because the meeting was going to be held on city of Los Angeles property, the company would not be able to discuss \u201cpricing during the meeting.\u201d Instead, he wrote in the email, Dienstag would be able to \u201ctalk to the community on the side regarding pricing.\u201d\n Others went further in endorsing Ring to community members. Officer Alejandro Galvan said he was keeping an eye on his older neighbors, who were \u201cleery\u201d of technology, to see when their adult children would visit so he could talk them into persuading their parents to use a Ring device.\n &#34;(Psss, the weirdos have flip phones),\u201d Galvan wrote. \u201cI\u2019m thinking their kids might be able to \u2018intervene.\u2019\u201d\n In an email connecting Cziment with the head of the South Brentwood Residents Assn. at Ring\u2019s request, Gray \u2014 the officer who had invited Ring to the station family picnic \u2014 asked if the neighborhood group could find a way to work with the company. \u201cOur detectives use and support this product,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d be more than welcome to attend and help facilitate any meetings. I completely believe in and support this product!\u201d\n    By 2019, the brand ambassador model had evolved. Ring no longer encouraged officers to promote its products with the promise of free or discounted merchandise. Instead, there was a new incentive for officers: growing the network of surveillance devices that they could access more easily than typical security cameras.\n Ring at the time was trying to grow its app, called Neighbors. For consumers, the service works much like the community message board NextDoor but with an even greater focus on crime. Residents can share and comment on suspicious or suspected activity in their communities and also post footage from their own cameras.\n For law enforcement organizations, the app is an investigative tool. The app is given to law enforcement and public safety agencies free of charge, according to Ring\u2019s website. Officers get crime alerts sent to their inbox, and they can batch download or send mass requests to users for footage directly through the app. It featured an interactive map of all Ring devices in the area; Ring says it discontinued that service in 2019. In response to specific police data requests, consumers can consent to sharing their footage with investigators.\n   Aguilar said the LAPD and Ring do not have a formal contract. Terms for similar partnerships in other parts of the country show that as part of the agreement to use the law enforcement portal, officers have been required to \u201cencourage adoption of the platform/app,\u201d in their communities,  Motherboard reported.\n Emails to LAPD officers show Ring leaned on the brand ambassador model to grow its app. After installing the law enforcement portal, Ring instructed officers to ask community members to join the platform because it \u201cgrows in value with each resident that downloads the app.\u201d\n  Obtaining surveillance footage can be a cumbersome process. It can require knocking on doors and asking for permission from the owners of individual cameras, or at times seeking a warrant \u2014 which brings a level of transparency and judicial oversight. Using Ring\u2019s vast network, officers could instead request and obtain footage with a few clicks. Emails to Ring show LAPD officers requested access to the company\u2019s investigative tool as soon as it was available to them, praised it and quickly put it to use.\n  \u201cNo more going door to  door to look for cameras and asking for footage,\u201d  Ring\u2019s instructional video shared with police departments states.\n In June 2020, some Ring users received an email notifying them that LAPD Det. Gerry Chamberlain was seeking video recordings from the Black Lives Matter protests, emails disclosed via a  public records request filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation show. During the protests, the notification read, individuals were injured and property was damaged and police were trying to find out who was responsible.\n  It was not immediately clear how many users received that notification, where exactly the LAPD was seeking video recordings, and how much material the agency ultimately obtained. By requesting video recordings directly from users, the LAPD avoided the multi-step process of securing a warrant or a subpoena to obtain footage from the vast network of personally owned cameras.\n  The LAPD said it keeps no record of when and how often officers make requests of Ring users.\n After The Times reached out to Ring for comment on this story, the company  announced that it changed its policies and now requires police to make requests for video from users in a public forum. \u201cThis way, anyone interested in knowing more about how their police agency is using Request for Assistance posts can simply visit the agency\u2019s profile and see the post history,\u201d the blog post read.\n In response to The Times\u2019 public records request, the LAPD said that it would be \u201cunduly burdensome\u201d to try to determine how often its officers requested or received video from Ring cameras.\n Consumers have embraced doorbell cameras as a useful tool for both home security and convenience. But Heidi Boghosian, a lawyer and former executive director of the National Lawyers Guild, warns of the dangers posed by this private surveillance apparatus, including a potential chilling effect on constitutionally protected freedoms.\n   Experts and activists have for years expressed concerns about the disproportionate effects of surveillance technology on people of color, and further reductions in transparency, she said, could lead to dragnet-style approaches and mass privacy violations.\n \u201cWhen you have the escalation of people\u2019s fears of property or violent crime, it changes the way they interpret ordinary actions of someone walking down the street or ringing their doorbell,\u201d she said, \u201cAnd that can [lead to] communities of color [being] falsely accused of crimes.\u201d\n The lack of transparency is further cause for concern, Electronic Frontier Foundation policy analyst Matthew Guariglia said, because Ring and police departments could be using fear to sell more devices and expand their surveillance powers. In a  letter sent to the California attorney general last week, the Electronic Frontier Foundation asked the state Department of Justice to investigate Ring\u2019s relationship with the 145 police departments across California with which it has partnered.\n  \u201cThese partnerships and these relationships blur the boundaries so that people no longer know if they have a real reason to be afraid in their neighborhood or if the police who come to their door and recommend they adopt the Ring or subsidize the cost of Ring just benefit from that relationship,\u201d Guariglia said.\n  11:45 AM, Jun. 17, 2021: This story was updated to note that Ring said it stopped providing law enforcement clients with an interactive map of Ring devices in 2019.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 06:39:15", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u514d\u8d39,\u4ee3\u7801,lapd,\u6212\u6307", "title": "\u62a5\u544a\uff1a\u6212\u6307\u63d0\u4f9b\u81f3\u5c11100\u540dLAPD\u5b98\u5458\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u514d\u8d39\u8bbe\u5907\u6216\u6298\u6263\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u9f13\u52b1\u4ed6\u4eec\u63a8\u8350\u5176\u4ea7\u54c1\u5230\u666e\u904d\u7684LAPD\u548c\u516c\u4f17 ", "title_en": "Report: Ring provided at least 100 LAPD officers with free devices or discount codes and encouraged them to recommend its products to fellow LAPD and the public", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-06-17/ring-influencer-marketing-los-angeles-police-department", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u514d\u8d39", "\u4ee3\u7801", "lapd", "\u6212\u6307"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "99ba9901052a95f7e5fdadfbf21d9754.jpeg", "infoid": 1066604, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Facebook\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98Mark Zuckerberg\u8c08\u5230\u4e86\u4ed6\u5728\u5065\u8eab\u548c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u4f1a\u8bae\u7b49\u5730\u533a\u7684\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u6240\u770b\u5230\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\n Zuckerberg\u5468\u56db\u4e0ePublicis Groupe\u4e3b\u5e2dMaurice Levy\u5728\u6cd5\u56fd\u79d1\u6280\u4f1a\u8baeVivatech\u8c08\u5230\u4e86\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\uff06\uff0339;\u5728\u6cd5\u56fd\u79d1\u6280\u4f1a\u8baevivatech\u3002\n Facebook\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98Mark Zuckerberg\u5728\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u672a\u6765\u770b\u5230\u4e86\u50cf\u666e\u7f57\u987f\u7684\u5065\u8eab\u8ba2\u9605\u3002\n Zuckerberg\u5468\u56db\u4e0ePublicis Groupe\u4e3b\u5e2dMaurice Levy\u8c08\u5230\u6cd5\u56fd\u79d1\u6280\u4f1a\u8baeVivatech\u7684\u865a\u62df\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u52aa\u529b\u3002\u4ed6\u8bf4\u6e38\u620f\u662f\u4eca\u5929VR\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u5386\u6216\u5065\u8eab\u7b49\u5730\u533a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u3002\n  \uff06\uff0334;\u60f3\u4e00\u60f3\u50cfpeloton\uff0c\u4f60\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u8ba2\u9605\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u8bbe\u5907\u662fvr\uff0c\u4f60\u628a\u4f60\u7684\u8033\u673a\uff0c\u4f60\uff06\uff0339;\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u60ca\u4eba\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\uff06\uff0339;\u91cd\u65b0\u505a\u4e00\u4e2a\u62f3\u51fb\u8bfe\u8bb2\u5e08\uff0c\u6216\u821e\u8e48\u8bfe\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u4ed6\u8bf4\u3002 \uff06\uff0334;\u5b83\uff06\uff0339;\u8fc5\u901f\u6269\u5c55\u8d85\u8d8a\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u8fdb\u5165\u4e00\u5806\u5176\u4ed6\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u6700\u7ec8\u5c06\u6210\u4e3a\u7535\u8bdd\u548cPC\u4e4b\u540e\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\n \u624e\u514b\u4f2f\u683c\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ed6\u4e0d\u76f8\u4fe1\u624b\u673a\u6216\u7535\u8111\u6b63\u5728\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u4f46\u603b\u6709\u4e00\u5929\uff0cVR\u5c06\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\n \u4f1a\u8bae\u5728VR\u4e16\u754c\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u865a\u62df\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\u4e3b\u529e\u5458\u5de5\u4f1a\u8bae\u3002 \n\uff06\uff0334;\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u4f1a\u8bae\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6211\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4eca\u5929\u7684\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e5f\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u539f\u56e0\u5b83\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5728\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u4f1a\u8bae\uff0c\u800c\uff0334;

He said gaming is the major use case for VR today, but that there&#39;s growing potential in areas like social experiences or fitness.\n  &#34;Think about it like Peloton, where you have a subscription, but instead the device is VR and you put on your headset, and you&#39;re in this amazing environment and you&#39;re doing a boxing class with an instructor, or a dance class,&#34; he said. &#34;It&#39;s quickly expanding beyond games into a bunch of other use cases, and we think that this is eventually going to be a big part of the next major computing platform after phones and after PCs.&#34;\n Zuckerberg said he does not believe phones or computers are going away, but that VR will someday rival that scale of importance.\n Meetings could also look different in the world of VR, where people might have virtual offices where they could host staff meetings, for instance.\n &#34;Compared to video conferences, I actually think that even with the state of virtual reality today, there are a lot of reasons it actually feels better to have meetings in virtual reality,&#34; Zuckerberg said. He added that new software will make it so that meetings will be able to happen in VR &#34;quite well&#34; in the near term.\n This week, the company  announced that it will begin testing advertisements that will appear within its Oculus virtual reality headsets.
