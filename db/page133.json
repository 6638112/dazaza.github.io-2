The financial round was led by Valar Ventures while Avid Ventures, Heartcore Capital and several prominent Nordic fintech unicorn founders participated in it.\n The two-year-old startup operates an eponymous mobile banking service. MAJORITY, whose name is a play on bringing financial inclusion to more people, runs a subscription service where it charges $5 a month to individuals and provides them with a range of financial services including an FDIC-insured bank account with early direct deposit at no overdraft fee, a debit card, mobile credit, and at-cost international phone calls.\n  Another reason why so many migrant communities are apprehensive of opening accounts with traditional banks, said Magnus Larsson (pictured above), founder and chief executive of MAJORITY, is that they don\u2019t feel welcome there.\n \u201cYou might not speak the language, or understand the cultural differences,\u201d he said. To tackle this, MAJORITY has hired customer and sales relation representatives from various communities to work with customers to understand their needs.\n Houston and Stockholm-headquartered MAJORITY also runs a community on its app to help individuals who have moved to the U.S. find familiar people and a \u201chome\u201d environment, he said. \u201cCustomers there find how to get a VISA as well as things like information about places to do local shopping,\u201d he said.\n \u201cAs veterans within the migrant tech sector, the team behind MAJORITY has already established themselves as builders of disruptive solutions for the world\u2019s immigrants,\u201d said James Fitzgerald, Founding Partner at Valar Ventures. \u201cBy supporting them for continued growth, we are confident that they will bring better and well-needed banking services to immigrants in the U.S.\u201d\n Starting today, the service is available in all 50 U.S. states and complies with local regulations, said Larsson, who previously served as the chief executive of Swedish technology firm Rebtel. Sutton Bank is MAJORITY\u2019s banking partner.\n The startup plans to deploy the new funding to expand its product offerings and broaden its team of about 80 people currently. \u201cSince we are a company of immigrants for immigrants, we also look forward to hiring diverse talent that exists within the different immigrant communities we serve. This is more important now than ever given that many have been hit hard by the pandemic,\u201d he said.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 22:49:03", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u79fb\u6c11,mobile,\u94f6\u884c", "title": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4eba\u4e3a\u79fb\u6c11\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u94f6\u884c\u670d\u52a1\u7b79\u96c6\u4e861900\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tMAJORITY raises $19 million for its mobile banking service for migrants\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/majority-raises-19-million-for-its-mobile-banking-service-for-migrants/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u79fb\u6c11", "mobile", "\u94f6\u884c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "38c4a5b57d7113083a0f30d582b8be46.jpg", "infoid": 1067464, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8d44\u91d1\u5305\u62ec\u56de\u62a5\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5e7f\u573aPEG\uff0cAPEX CAPITAL\u4f19\u4f34\u548c\u52a0\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06Zeller\u7684\u603b\u91cf\u7eb3\u5165\u4e00\u5e74\u5185\u76848100\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u6570\u989d\u5305\u62ec\u7531Lee Fixel\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u516c\u53f8\u548cSeed Funding\u7684\u5f15\u53d1\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9884\u5148\u53d1\u5c04\u7cfb\u5217A.\n  \u6cfd\u52d2\u4e8e\u53bb\u5e74\u7531Ben Pfisterer\uff0cSquare\u7684\u524d\u4e9a\u592a\u5730\u533a\u548c\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u8d1f\u8d23\u4eba\u548cDominic Yap\u6210\u7acb\uff0cFintech\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u6218\u7565\u548c\u589e\u957f\u94c5\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4e8e5\u67084\u65e5\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ea7\u54c1\u4e3a\u5c0f\u578b\u4f01\u4e1a\uff0c\u5305\u62ecEFTPOS\uff08\u5728\u9500\u552e\u70b9\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8d44\u91d1\u8f6c\u79fb\uff09\u7801\u5934\uff0c\u4e1a\u52a1\u8d26\u6237\u548c\u5361\u7247\u3002\n \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u53d1\u5e03\u540e\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6708\u5185\u6ce8\u518c\u4e861,500\u591a\u4e2a\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u4f01\u4e1a\uff0c\u6bcf\u5468\u652f\u4ed8\u91cf\u589e\u957f200\uff05\u3002\u5927\u7ea680\uff05\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u4ece\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u6700\u5927\u94f6\u884c\u5f00\u59cb\u4f7f\u7528Zeller\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u7528\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bf9\u8f83\u4f4e\u8d39\u7528\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u652f\u6301\u7684\u613f\u671b\u3002\n Zeller\u7684\u65b0\u8d44\u91d1\u5c06\u7528\u4e8e\u53d1\u5c55\u5176\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u586b\u514518\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5c06\u652f\u6301Zeller\u8ba1\u5212\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u94f6\u884c\u3002\n \u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u9648\u8ff0\u4e2d\uff0cSpark Capital Investor James Kuklinski\u8bf4\uff1a\u201c\u4ece\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u4e0eBen\u4f1a\u9762\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u77e5\u9053\u6211\u4eec\u60f3\u6210\u4e3aZeller\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u94f6\u884c\u666f\u89c2\u7531\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u73b0\u4efb\u8005\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6280\u672f\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e2d\u65ad\u6210\u719f\u3002\u201c ", "note_en": "The funding included participation from returning investors Square Peg, Apex Capital Partners and Addition, and brings Zeller\u2019s total raised in under a year to $81 million AUD. This amount includes a pre-launch Series A led by Addition, the investment firm started by Lee Fixel, and seed funding.\n  Zeller was founded last year by Ben Pfisterer, Square\u2019s former Asia Pacific and Australia head, and Dominic Yap, the fintech\u2019s former strategy and growth lead. The company  launched its first products for small businesses on May 4, including EFTPOS (electronic funds transfer at point of sale) terminals, business accounts and cards.\n The company says more than 1,500 Australian businesses signed up in the month after its launch, and weekly payment volume has been growing 200%. About 80% of businesses who started using Zeller switched from Australia\u2019s four biggest banks, citing their desire for lower fees and better customer support.\n Zeller\u2019s new funding will be used to grow its research and engineering hub, including filling 18 new engineering roles that will support Zeller\u2019s plan to become a fully-regulated business bank.\n In a press statement, Spark Capital investor James Kuklinski said, \u201cFrom our first meeting with Ben, we knew we wanted to be a part of Zeller.

He began to think about it, much like climate change, as a huge, multi-dimensional set of problems. He wanted to understand the scope of these problems to use his investment capital to help address some of these issues.\n  \u201cSo we incubated the Racial Inequity Drawdown at 50 years and the reason we did is because we got excited about finding and funding companies that addressed racial inequity in the same way we do the climate crisis or disease or all these other things \u2014 and it\u2019s really hard because it\u2019s such a multi-dimensional issue,\u201d he said.\n As a starting point, he decided to create a document similar to the Climate Drawdown that looked at these issues in a single place to help him and his firm understand the scope of the problem, and to help them look at their investments through a racial equity lens.\n \u201cWe started to pull together resources just for ourselves, so that we could have racial equity be a lens that we use for our own investing and we were like, \u2018Oh my God, there\u2019s a lot here.&#39;\u201d\n That led to one of the company\u2019s fellows taking ownership of the project with the goal of fleshing out a comprehensive document. The resulting framework is built on three pillars or broad sets of categories including Health &amp; Wellbeing, Equality of Opportunity and Sustainable Systems with each pillar including different elements of the racial inequity problem that need to be addressed. And each sub-category includes a detailed definition of the problem, key terms, a set of companies and organizations currently working on the issue and what still needs to be done (perhaps openings for startup ideas).\n  To make it more than a document created in-house, Bannon and his team wanted to take it a step further, so he brought in a group of college students to begin reaching out to communities of color to participate in this initiative and bring it to life.\n One of those students is Elizabeth Poku, a rising Sophomore at Princeton, who said she was drawn to the project as a way to flip the script on racism. \u201cWhat I hope to do in the future is really hijack existing systems and structures that used to put down and oppress people and make sure we\u2019re changing those narratives, changing those systems to really work for those that they were putting down,\u201d she explained.\n She saw the Racial inequity Drawdown as a way to help to do this and joined the team, helping to write some sections of the document including the one on the impact of lack of access to healthcare on people of color. She says that the team then reached out to communities working on the problem and began to compile resources into a database including startups that have been working to solve the different elements documented in the framework.\n  Bannon says that investors, who want to build racial equity as a lens into their investment process can use this document as a guide, and it also acts as a signal that a firm cares about this as it allocates resources to different startups, certainly that\u2019s the case for Fifty Years.\n \u201cPart of this for us was just defining what that means, and now we have a really great start here. And then second is letting entrepreneurs know that we care about racial equity as a lens, and that if you are addressing racial equity, that\u2019s going to be a big plus in our book.\u201d\n He added, \u201cObviously, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re definitely going to be able to fund you, but that\u2019s going to be a big plus, and we\u2019re excited about that and attacking racial inequity through technology and entrepreneurship.\u201d\n The firm sees today\u2019s launch as a starting point, one that others can build on and add to the conversation, and build on this initial framework. At the same time, it gives members of the startup ecosystem, whether that\u2019s entrepreneurs or investors, a way to start looking at their investments or projects through this racial equity lens.\n  \u201cWe really want to make this drawdown start the conversation and make sure this is at the forefront of people\u2019s minds. That\u2019s our main goal. So yes, if that includes helping community members really find out how they can [help] these startups get into the tech world, that\u2019s definitely part of our mission,\u201d Poku explained.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 22:48:29", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u521b\u5efa,creates", "title": "\u516c\u53f8\u521b\u5efa\u5f00\u653e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9VCS\u548c\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u4e89\u8bba\u79cd\u65cf\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tFirm creates open framework to help VCs and founders address racial inequity\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/firm-creates-open-framework-to-help-vcs-and-founders-address-racial-inequity/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u521b\u5efa", "creates"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "0163bb0a86b5ae6727eeb398bc40f25f.jpg", "infoid": 1067462, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u6b3eTweet\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u73b0\u5728\u84ec\u52c3\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u4eba\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u9700\u8981\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u3002\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u793e\u533a\u5f00\u59cb\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u8bb8\u591a\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u652f\u4ed8\u6708\u4efd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e0d\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\n Saas Startup\u7684\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u5728\u8fd9\u4e00\u60c5\u666f\u4e2d\u5904\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8be5\u90e8\u95e8\u73b0\u5728\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u516c\u53f8\u51e0\u4e4e\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e00\u5929\u4ea7\u751f\u6536\u5165\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u51fa\u4efb\u4f55\u8d44\u91d1\u3002\n \u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u4ecd\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u544a\u8bc9\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u652f\u4ed8\u81ea\u5df1\u591a\u5c11\u94b1\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u522b\u4eba\u5728\u505a\u4ec0\u4e48\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6536\u96c6\u4e86\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u548cVCS\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u60a8\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002\n  \u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u8d54\u507f\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u85aa\u6c34\u201d\uff0c\u4f46\u951a\u5b9a\u56f4\u7ed5\u85aa\u916c\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u8c08\u8bdd\u53ef\u4ee5\u9020\u6210\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u671f\u671b\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5728\u60a8\u8ba1\u5212\u652f\u4ed8\u81ea\u5df1\u4ee5\u53ca\u60a8\u7684\u8fc7\u53bb\u6216\u5f53\u524d\u4ef7\u503c\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u4ece\u5176\u5148\u524d\u7684\u5de5\u8d44\u4e2d\u524a\u51cf\u85aa\u916c\u3002\n Chris Sosnowski\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\uff1a\u57282020\u5e74\u521d\u57282020\u5e74\u5f00\u59cb\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u4ed6\u5728\u6c34\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u5168\u804c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ed6\u66fe\u7ecf\u8d5a\u8fc7\u201c\u8d85\u8fc7\u201d100,000\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u4f46\u4ed6\u8bf4\u4ed6\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u85aa\u6c34\u4e0d\u662f\u4ed6\u5236\u5b9a\u8d54\u507f\u65f6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u51b3\u5b9a\u6839\u636e\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4fdd\u6301\u516c\u53f8\u8dd1\u6b65\uff0c\u201d\u4ed6\u5199\u4fe1\u7ed9TechChrunch\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u6839\u636e\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u5c06\u9700\u8981\u4ed8\u94b1\u3002\n \u8fd9\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u4ecb\u610f\u9012\u5ef6\u8865\u507f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u62e5\u6709\u6743\u76ca\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u4eba\u90fd\u662f\u719f\u6089\u7684\u3002\u628a\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u94b1\u6295\u5165\u516c\u53f8\u5e76\u62e5\u6709\u5b83\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4e00\u5207\u987a\u5229\uff0cSosnowski\u5c31\u4f1a\u88ab\u8d54\u507f\u3002 \u201c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7eaa\u5f55\uff0c\u6211\u5e0c\u671b\u4e00\u5e74\u4e2d\u7684[A]\u85aa\u6c34\u4ed8\u56de\u53bb\uff0c\u5426\u5219[\u5b83]\u8fd9\u6837\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u201d\u4ed6\u8bf4\u3002 ", "note_en": "This tweet is just one of many in a now burgeoning conversation about how founder pay needs to change. The startup and investor communities are beginning to realize that many founders can\u2019t go without pay for months.\n Founders of SaaS startups are at an advantage in this scenario as the sector now has many companies generating revenue almost from day one, sometimes without needing to raise any funding at all.\n However, the success still doesn\u2019t tell founders how much to pay themselves, or what others are doing. To help with this, we\u2019ve gathered insights from founders and VCs and narrowed down the most important factors and benchmarks to guide your decision.\n  Founder compensation is often referred to as a \u201cfounder salary,\u201d but anchoring the conversation around the salary framework can create the wrong expectation. For example, you could try to establish a correlation between what you plan to pay yourself and your past or current value on the job market. Instead, the data we gathered indicates that founders typically take a pay cut from their previous salaries.\n Chris Sosnowski is an interesting example: Before he \u201ctook the plunge\u201d at the beginning of 2020 to work full time on his water data management startup  Waterly, he used to earn \u201cwell over\u201d $100,000. But he says his previous salary wasn\u2019t a key factor when he set his compensation. \u201cI decided to pay myself based on what I thought it would take to keep the company running,\u201d he wrote to TechCrunch.\n That brings to mind deferred compensation, which will be familiar to anyone who owns equity. Having put his own money into the company and owning the majority of it, Sosnowski is set to be compensated for his efforts if all goes well. \u201cFor the record, I do hope to pay myself back [a] salary for the year or so [it is] reduced like this,\u201d he said.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 22:48:15", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u521b\u59cb\u4eba,saas", "title": "\u4f5c\u4e3aSaaS\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u591a\u5c11\u94b1 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tHow much to pay yourself as a SaaS founder\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/how-much-to-pay-yourself-as-a-saas-founder/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u521b\u59cb\u4eba", "saas"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d62b916f02d63324e9623d36780b900e.jpg", "infoid": 1067461, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "6\u670822\u65e5\u7684\u5e03\u9c81\u585e\u5c14\uff08\u8def\u900f\u793e\uff09 - \u8c37\u6b4c\u5468\u4e8c\u518d\u6b21\u5728\u6b27\u76df\u53cd\u6258\u62c9\u65af\u805a\u5149\u706f\u4e2d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u5bf9\u5176\u6570\u5b57\u5e7f\u544a\u4e1a\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u548c\u5e7f\u544a\u5546\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u5bf9\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u548c\u5e7f\u544a\u5546\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\n \u6b27\u76df\u7ade\u8d5b\u6267\u6cd5\u8005\uff06\uff0339;\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\u5360\u636e\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc780\u4ebf\u6b27\u5143\uff0895\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u9635\u7ebf\uff0c\u4ee5\u963b\u6b62\u5728\u7ebf\u8d2d\u7269\uff0cAndroid\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5e7f\u544a\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u3002\n \u6b27\u6d32\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u8c03\u67e5\u8c37\u6b4c\u662f\u5426\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u8bbf\u95ee\u7f51\u7ad9\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u6765\u8c03\u67e5\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6b64\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\n \uff06\uff0334;\u6211\u4eec\u62c5\u5fc3\u8c37\u6b4c\u4f7f\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u5728\u7ebf\u5e7f\u544a\u670d\u52a1\u66f4\u52a0\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4ee5\u7ade\u4e89\u6240\u8c13\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u6280\u672f\u5806\u6808\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u6b27\u6d32\u7ade\u4e89\u4e13\u5458Margrethe Westager\u5728\u4e00\u4efd\u58f0\u660e\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u3002\n \u8c37\u6b4c\u53bb\u5e74\u4ece\u7f51\u4e0a\u5e7f\u544a\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e861470\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u6536\u5165\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u4efb\u4f55\u5176\u4ed6\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5e7f\u544a\u5305\u62ec\u641c\u7d22\uff0cYouTube\u548cGmail\u6838\u7b97\u5176\u6574\u4f53\u9500\u552e\u548c\u5229\u6da6\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u3002\n \u5927\u7ea616\uff05\u7684\u6536\u5165\u6765\u81ea\u516c\u53f8\uff06\uff0339;

European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.\n Google generated $147 billion in revenue from online ads last year, more than any other company in the world, with ads including search, YouTube and Gmail accounting for the bulk of its overall sales and profits.\n About 16% of its revenue came from the company&#39;s display or network business, in which other media companies use Google technology to sell ads on their website and apps.\n &#34;We will also be looking at Google&#39;s policies on user tracking to make sure they are in line with fair competition,&#34; Vestager added.\n  &#34;Thousands of European businesses use our advertising products to reach new customers and fund their websites every single day. They choose them because they&#39;re competitive and effective,&#34; a Google spokesperson said.\n The Commission said its investigation would span Google services, including Display &amp; Video 360 (DV360) and Google Ads to buy online display advertisements on YouTube, Google Ad Manager which is used by publishers to auction ad space, and AdX which is one of several marketplaces which can manage auctions.\n Google&#39;s plan to remove browser cookies and also to stop tracking Android users via a tool known as an advertising identifier will also be looked at.\n Reuters reported exclusively last week that the EU competition enforcer would investigate Google\u2019s digital advertising business before the end of the year.\n Google&#39;s adtech business is also under fire in the United States, with the Justice Department, joined by some states, suing last year for abusing its dominance in search ads. A group of states led by Texas in a later lawsuit focused on anti-competitive behaviour on the network side of the house.\n A new EU inquiry could end up targeting all of Google&#39;s ad empire. According to market researcher eMarketer, Google could control 27% of global online ad spending this year, including 57% for search ads and 10% of display.\n While the figures may not appear to represent a monopoly at first glance, advertisers and rivals contend that Google&#39;s various software play a role in so many facets of the market that the company is impossible to avoid.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 22:40:58", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5e7f\u544a,google,\u8c37\u6b4c,rust,\u6b27\u76df", "title": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u5728\u6b27\u76df\u5341\u5b57\u67b6\u518d\u6b21\u4e0e\u5e7f\u544a\u53cd\u6258\u62c9\u65af\u67e5\u8be2 ", "title_en": "Google in EU Crosshairs Again With Advertising Antitrust Inquiry", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/technology/eu-antitrust-regulators-investigate-googles-adtech-business-2021-06-22/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5e7f\u544a", "google", "\u8c37\u6b4c", "rust", "\u6b27\u76df"]}]
