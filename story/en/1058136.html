In a Clubhouse  conversation following the sale, Field said he hoped that a century from now the blocky image he had sold would be seen as the “Mona Lisa of digital art.”</p><p>销售发生在彼此20小时内，没有加入相同的标题，即收到的甜食拍卖，但在技术媒体上有一些覆盖率，主要是因为其中一个外星人被迪伦领域出售，所以设计软件启动Figma的首席执行官。在销售后的俱乐部谈话中，领域表示，他希望从现在开始的一个世纪他所销售的块状图片将被视为“Mona Lisa的数字艺术”。</p><p>  The pixelated alien portraits belonged to an NFT platform called  CryptoPunks. In the world of NFTs, the platform is as close to ancient history as it gets, meaning it’s almost four years old. There are 10,000 punks, all of which were procedurally generated and claimed for free when the project launched in 2017.</p><p>  像素化的外籍人像属于一个名为Cryptopunks的NFT平台。在NFTS的世界里，平台就像它一样接近古代历史，这意味着它差不多四岁了。有10,000个朋克，所有这些朋克都是在2017年推出的项目启动时免费制作并索赔。</p><p> Since then, the economy built around trading these images has sauntered on with a small but passionate community, at least until a few months ago. That’s when it suddenly exploded, dragging into the fray Silicon Valley CEOs, prominent venture capitalists, famous YouTubers, poker stars and major business personalities. The platform has seen nearly $200 million worth of transaction volume in official deals since launch, according to NFT tracking site  CryptoSlam, with 98% of that volume flowing through the platform in the past few months.</p><p> 从那时起，交易周围的经济这些图像已经暂停了一个小但激情的社区，至少直到几个月前。这是它突然爆炸的时候，拖入磨损硅谷首席执行官，着名的风险资本家，着名的YouTubers，扑克明星和主要商业人物。根据NFT追踪站点加密似乎，该平台在官方交易中，官方交易的价值近2亿美元的交易量，其中98％的卷在过去几个月里流经平台。</p><p> The sudden rise in punk prices is owed to an explosion of interest in NFTs largely brought about by climbing cryptocurrency prices, the rise in popularity of Dapper Labs’ NBA Top Shot and the resurgence of the physical collectibles markets, all of which have made some investors more comfortable with the idea of betting on digital goods.</p><p> 朋克价格的突然上涨据攀爬加密货价大幅增加的NFT爆炸，令人兴气的兴气升高，普及实验室的NBA热销和物理收藏品市场的复苏，所有这些都制定了一些投资者对博彩博彩的想法更舒服。</p><p> Today, the cheapest punk you can buy will run you about $30,000 in Ethereum cryptocurrency, while the rarest may be worth just shy of $10 million.</p><p> 今天，您可以购买的最便宜的朋克将在国内加密货币中乘坐大约30,000美元，而稀有可能仅为1000万美元。</p><p> CryptoPunks have captured plenty of attention, but even with all eyeballs on the project, people still aren’t sure exactly what they’re looking at.</p><p> Cryptopunks已经捕获了很多关注，但即使在项目上的所有眼球，人们仍然不确定他们正在看的内容。</p><p> “In NFT world, people are talking about selling Jack Dorsey tweets, Top Shots and Beeple in the same sentence right now,” Sotheby’s CEO Charles Stewart told TechCrunch in an interview. “The lines can get a little blurry. When you look at CryptoPunks, are they art? Are they collectibles? Are they… you know, well… what are they exactly?”</p><p> “在NFT世界中，人们正在谈论卖出杰克罗西推文，顶级射击和贝贝尔在同一个句子中，”Sotheby的首席执行官Charles Stewart告诉TechCrunch。 “线条可以得到一点模糊。当你看着加密屋时，他们是艺术吗？他们是收藏品吗？他们是......你知道，好吧......他们完全是什么？“ </p><p>   Back in early 2017, John Watkinson and Matt Hall were playing with a pixelated character generator they built, and they were pretty enthusiastic about the fun little pop art portraits they had been cooking up. By June, they had created 10,000 characters with different hairstyles, hats and glasses for a project called CryptoPunks that would be hosted on the nascent Ethereum blockchain. Some punks had a handful of attributes, some had none, some were apes, some were aliens. While the creators had a hand in curating some elements, they let their generator take control of the creativity.</p><p>回到2017年初，约翰·沃特库斯顿和马特霍尔正在使用他们建造的像素化角色发电机，他们非常热情地对他们烹饪的有趣的小流行艺术肖像。到6月，他们创造了10,000个字符，其中包含不同的发型，帽子和眼镜，该项目被称为加密套房，这些项目将被托管在新生的Ethereum区块链上。有些朋克有少量的属性，有些人没有，有些是猿，有些是外星人。虽然创造者掌握了一些元素的手，但他们让他们的发电机控制着创造力。</p><p> They launched to modest interest from a small community of blockchain enthusiasts who only had to pay a few pennies in Ethereum “gas” transaction fees to own their own punk. It was a novel idea, pre-dating the NFT platform CryptoKitties by months and NBA Top Shot by years, but it arrived at the cusp of crypto’s 2017 wave during the early throes of initial coin offerings, where scams were plentiful and attention was hard to come by. Hall said that about 20-30 punks were claimed in the days following launch.</p><p> 他们向一个小区群体的一个小型社区推出了谦虚的兴趣，他们只需要在以外的“天然气”交易费用中只需支付一些便士，以拥有自己的朋克。这是一个小说的想法，按数月和NBA上射门预先约会NFT平台加密，但它在初始硬币产品的早期伸展期间到达了Crypto 2017浪潮的尖峰，诈骗丰富，注意力很难顺道。霍尔表示，在发布后的日子里索赔了大约20-30个朋克。</p><p>  Then a week later Mashable wrote a  story about the fledgling crypto art project, and within hours every punk was gone.</p><p>  然后一周后，Maskable写了一个关于刚刚的加密艺术项目的故事，而且每朋克都在几小时内。</p><p> Some users went all-in immediately. One user that went by the username  hemba has become something of a cautionary figure in the CryptoPunks community, claiming more than 1,000 punks at launch and selling every one of them before the market took off this year, missing out on tens of millions of dollars in profits at current prices.  Another user who goes by  mr703 claimed some 703 punks in total at launch, hundreds of which they are still holding onto years later in a collection similarly worth tens of millions.</p><p> 有些用户立即全力以赴。由用户名血珠的一个用户已成为Cryptopunks社区中的警示人物，在市场上开始并在今年起飞之前，在市场上脱落之前，销售了超过1,000个朋克，而且在数百万美元中失踪目前的利润。另一个由MR703的用户总共宣称大约703个朋克，其中数百人仍然持续到一系列的收集，同样价值数千万。</p><p> In a Discord chat with the pseudonymous  mr703, we asked whether they felt they had enough or if there were any punks they still intended to buy. “I own all the punks I ever really want,” they typed back. Their public wallet shows they paid more than $37,000 for a punk in the minutes in between our question and their answer. They spent $35,000 on another one several hours later.</p><p> 在与Pseudonymous MR703的不和谐聊天中，我们询问他们是否觉得他们有足够的或者如果有任何朋克他们仍然打算购买。 “我拥有我真正想要的所有朋克，”他们打了回来。他们的公共钱包显示他们在我们的问题与答案之间的几分钟内支付了超过37,000美元的朋克。他们几个小时后就在另一个小时内花了35,000美元。</p><p> Some investors who have already gone all-in backing risky cryptocurrencies see NFTs as a way to diversify their crypto holdings. Others see CryptoPunks as more of a game.</p><p> 一些已经消失的投资者已经过于支持风险的加密货币，请参阅NFTS作为多元化密码控股的一种方式。其他人将加密障碍视为更多的游戏。</p><p>  “I think that with each year that passes the definition of what is gambling and what is investing move closer and closer together,” says Mike McDonald, a 31-year-old professional poker player who recently bought his first punk.</p><p>  “我认为每年都通过了赌博的定义以及投资更近，更靠近在一起的内容，”一位31岁的专业扑克球员迈克麦当劳说，最近买了他的第一次朋克。 </p><p> Why are some punks worth tens of thousands of dollars while others are worth millions? Users in the thriving CryptoPunks Discord community have had to decide that on their own, combining objective analysis of the rarity of certain design attributes with the more subjective impressions of punk “aesthetics.”</p><p>为什么一些朋克价值数万美元，而其他朋克在数百万美元？蓬勃发展的Cryptopunks Discord社区必须自己决定，结合对某些设计属性的稀有性的客观分析，与朋克“美学的更具主观印象。</p><p> Things aren’t always predictable. Earrings are the most common attribute for punks, commanding much lower price floors than those with beanie hats, which are the rarest attribute. But hundreds of punks are wearing 3D glasses, yet they tend to earn a hefty premium over those with green clown hair even though fewer of those punks exist. Some attributes gain market momentum randomly; for instance, the market for punks wearing hoodies has been particularly hot in recent weeks.</p><p> 事情并不总是可预测的。耳环是朋克最常见的属性，指挥比较少于豆帽的价格楼层，这是稀有的属性。但数百个朋克正在佩戴3D眼镜，但它们往往会在那些有绿色小丑头发的人身上赚取良好的溢价，即使这些朋克少少。一些属性随机增益市场势头;例如，最近几周的朋克穿着连帽衫的市场一直特别热。</p><p> “Obviously this is a very speculative market… but it’s almost more honest than the stock market,” user Max Orgeldinger tells TechCrunch. “Kudos to Elon Musk — and I’m a big Tesla fan — but there are no fundamentals that support that stock price. It’s the same when you look at GameStop. With the whole NFT community, it’s almost more honest because nobody’s getting tricked into thinking there’s some very complicated math that no one can figure out. This is just people making up prices and if you want to pay it, that’s the price and if you don’t want to pay it, that’s not the price.”</p><p> “显然这是一个非常投机的市场......但它几乎比股票市场更诚实，”用户Max Orgeldinger告诉TechCrunch。 “荣耀至伊隆麝香 - 我是一个大的特斯拉粉丝 - 但没有支持股票价格的基本面。当你看看Gamestop时它是一样的。随着整个NFT社区，它几乎更诚实，因为没有人陷入思考，没有人能够弄清楚一些非常复杂的数学。这只是弥补价格的人，如果你想支付它，那就是价格，如果你不想付钱，那就不是价格。“</p><p> As prices have surged, owning a piece of the CryptoPunks’ finite supply has become a “digital flex” in its own right, especially when used as an avatar on social media sites, several punk owners told us. That has drawn plenty of wealthy buyers outside the blockchain world, including influencers like YouTuber Logan Paul who uploaded a  video last month detailing his $170,000 purchase of several punks.</p><p> 由于价格飙升，拥有一块加密套装的有限电源已成为自己的权利，特别是当在社交媒体网站上用作阿凡达时，几个朋克所有者告诉我们。这已经在区块链世界之外吸引了大量的富裕买家，包括像Youtuber Logan Paul这样的影响者上传了一个视频，上个月详细说明了他的几个朋克购买了170,000美元。</p><p>  “When you don’t have a punk, the ecosystem seems like this gentlemen’s club of the 10,000 people that can afford these kinds of avatars,” says McDonald.</p><p>  “当你没有朋克的时候，生态系统似乎是这个可以买到这类头像的10,000人的绅士俱乐部，”麦当劳说。</p><p> There is some concern among the community whether all of this outside attention is a sign of an impending crash in prices, though many investors feel reassured by the historical value of CryptoPunks among NFTs. Nevertheless, some of the investors have a hard time convincing those in their lives that what they’re doing is anything but reckless.</p><p> 社区中的所有这些外面都有一些担忧是在价格上迫在眉睫的崩溃的标志，尽管许多投资者在NFTS之间的历史价值感到放心。尽管如此，一些投资者很难说服他们的生活中的人，他们所做的就是犹豫不决。</p><p> After a recent six-figure punk purchase, user Chris Mintern says his girlfriend was exasperated that he had just dropped more money on a punk than her house was worth. “She says it’s all just a bunch of internet nerds who don’t appreciate the value of money. That to them, it’s just a game and numbers on a screen,” he told TechCrunch.</p><p> 在最近的六位数朋克购买后，用户克里斯·姆内恩说他的女朋友被激怒，他刚刚在朋克上赚了更多的钱，而不是她的房子值得。 “她说这只是一群不欣赏金钱价值的互联网书呆子。那对他们来说，它只是一个游戏和屏幕上的数字，“他告诉TechCrunch。 </p><p> The community surrounding CryptoPunks has largely bloomed on the chat app Discord in a dedicated group where users that are verified as punk owners tend to drive conversations and can gather attention for up-and-coming NFT projects they’re betting on.</p><p>周围的Cryptopunks的社区在一个专门的小组中，聊天应用程序不和谐在聊天的群体中盛开，其中被验证为朋克所有者倾向于推动对话，并可以收集他们投注上升的NFT项目的注意。</p><p> “It’s a bit of a cult,” said user  thebeautyandthepunk in an interview.</p><p> “这是一点邪教，”用户在面试中说，我们的Beautyandthepunk说道。</p><p> Like many early users,  thebeautyandthepunk  has stayed pseudonymous since claiming a couple dozen punks at launch, telling us that no one in her life has any idea she’s sitting on an NFT collection likely worth millions — except her accountant. She did recently decide to make it known that she was one of the few female traders who have been present in the overwhelmingly male CryptoPunks community since the beginning.</p><p> 与许多早期的用户一样，Beautyandthepunk已经留下了伪手，自从发布会上有几个朋克，告诉我们，她的生活中没有人在坐在NFT系列中的任何想法可能是数百万美元 - 除了她的会计师。她最近决定知道，她是自从一开始以来一直存在于绝大陆男性加密社区的少数女性交易商之一。</p><p> “I really try to keep my real life and my crypto life completely separate,” she says. “But people need to know that women have been [in this space] for a while and we’re not going anywhere.”</p><p> “我真的试图让我的真实生活和我的加密生活完全分开，”她说。 “但人们需要知道女性已经[在这个空间]一段时间，我们不会去任何地方。”</p><p> Today, all 10,000 punks are scattered across some 1,889 wallets, according to crypto tracker Etherscan. Some of those accounts are inactive and feared dead, with the punks inside them lost on the blockchain forever. The largest single wallet of punks today belongs to the platform’s creators, holding some 488 punks. It’s their only ownership in a blockchain-based marketplace where most mechanics are already set in stone.</p><p> 根据Crypto Tracker Etherscan，今天，所有10,000个朋克都分散在约1,889个钱包中。其中一些账户是不活跃的，害怕死亡，他们里面的朋克永远在区块链上迷失了。今天的朋克最大的单人钱包属于平台的创作者，持有大约488个朋克。这是他们在基于区块的市场中唯一拥有的所有权，大多数机械师已经成立在石头上。</p><p> “We’re just users now, too. Nothing about our website is specific to us having created the project,” Watkinson tells TechCrunch. “Our only equity is through the punks we own. We don’t take a cut of the market or anything.”</p><p> “我们现在只是用户。我们的网站上的任何内容都没有是我们创建该项目的特定，“Watkinson告诉TechCrunch。 “我们唯一的股权是通过我们拥有的朋克。我们不会削减市场或任何东西。“</p><p>   Today, CryptoPunks’ creators are working on NFTs full time. While they can’t make any underlying changes to the CryptoPunks contract, they have aimed to improve the website’s marketplace while hopping into the Discord group to keep an eye on the ever-growing community of users.</p><p>   今天，Cryptopunks的创造者正在全职工作。虽然他们无法对加密合同进行任何潜在的变化，但他们旨在改善网站的市场，同时跳入Discord集团，以密切关注不断增长的用户社区。 </p><p> “It was never our intention for this to sort of be our careers,” Watkinson says.</p><p>“这绝不是我们有点成为我们的职业生涯，”Watkinson说。</p><p> In 2019, the duo debuted a follow-up project called  Autoglyphs, which brought generative art to the blockchain. It didn’t boast the pop aesthetic of CryptoPunks, but it added a new layer to their exploration of blockchain art. Hall and Watkinson have built up a company around their various projects called  Larva Labs, and they are in the process of building up a new NFT project that they hope will have a lower barrier of entry than CryptoPunks and Autoglyphs.</p><p> 2019年，DUO推出了一个名为Autoglyphs的后续项目，将生成艺术带到区块链中。它没有夸耀Cryptopunks的流行审美，但它为他们对街区艺术的探索添加了一层。大厅和Watkinson已经建立了一个名为Larva Labs的各种项目的公司，他们正在建立一个新的NFT项目，他们希望比加密吞噬和自身的屏障较低的屏障。</p><p> “As the CryptoPunks get more and more expensive, they’re just hard to get into,” Hall says.</p><p> “随着加密局越来越贵，他们很难进入，”大厅说。</p><p> At around $200 million in official marketplace sales, CryptoPunks’ total lifetime sales volume is about 40% of what Dapper Labs’ NBA Top Shot has achieved in its past several months. Though CryptoPunks has done so with 0.35% of Top Shot’s total transaction volume, which is fewer than 12,000 trades compared to more than 3.3 million, according to CryptoSlam. Those high transaction numbers spread across millions of NFTs mean much less value per transaction on Top Shot, but a much, much bigger pool of active users.</p><p> 在官方市场销售额约为2亿美元，加密持续终身销量大约是一个大约在过去几个月内达到的Dapper Labs的NBA顶级射击的40％。据Cryptoslam的说法，虽然加密套装占顶级总交易量的0.35％，但与超过330万的交易较少。在数百万个NFT上传播的那些高交易编号意味着每次交易的价值更少，而是一个大量更大的活动用户。</p><p> Last month, Dapper Labs  announced they had raised $305 million at a $2.6 billion valuation as they look to expand their private Flow blockchain to other blockchain “games” through more high-profile partnerships. Hall and Watkinson have been watching Dapper Labs’ success, but don’t think Larva Labs will need venture funding to continue exploring what’s next for NFTs.</p><p> 上个月，Dapper Labs宣布他们已经筹集了305亿美元的估值，因为他们希望通过更多的高调的合作伙伴关系将私人流区块区块扩展到其他区块链“游戏”。大厅和Watkinson一直在看着令人望远的实验室的成功，但不要认为幼虫实验室将需要风险投资资金继续探索下一个NFTS的内容。</p><p>  “Rather than looking at becoming a large company and doing a deal with the NBA or something like that, we’re more just looking forward to kind of just continuing to explore the tech possibilities,” Watkinson said. “What we love about CryptoPunks is the action, and so we’d like to find a way back to sort of that level of action, and our next project is going to try to find ways to sort of keep the deal flow going.”</p><p>  “而不是看着成为一家大公司，并与NBA或类似的事情进行达成协议，我们更普遍仍然持续探索技术可能性，”沃特金森说。 “我们对Cryptopunks的热爱是行动，所以我们想找到一种方法回归那种行动级别，我们的下一个项目将尝试解决途中的方法，以便保持交易流程。”</p><p> They have few details to share on the new project, which they said will debut “relatively soon” this year.</p><p> 他们有很少的细节分享新项目，他们表示将在今年的“相对较早”首次亮相。 </p><p>   CryptoPunks lore is largely steeped in the assertion that they are the oldest NFT project on the Ethereum blockchain. It’s a line that was floated by almost all of the punk owners I spoke with as the main reason they had dumped hundreds of thousands of dollars into the platform. In Paul’s recent YouTube video, he justified prices to his skeptical friends by noting, “[CryptoPunks] is the first and that makes it special.”</p><p>Cryptopunks Lore在很大程度上沉浸在断言中，他们是Ethereum Blockchain上最古老的NFT项目。这是几乎所有朋克所有者都浮现的一条线，我用倾倒了数十万美元进入平台的主要原因。在保罗最近的YouTube视频中，他通过注意到他持怀疑态度的朋友们对他的持怀疑态度进行了合理的，“[Cryptopunks]是第一个，使其特别。”</p><p> But over the past few weeks, holes in that narrative have begun to emerge, as “crypto archaeologists” have begun to unearth abandoned NFT projects that were created in Ethereum’s earliest days, with at least one arriving before CryptoPunks. We recently spoke with Cyrus Adkisson, the creator of a project called  Etheria, which he debuted back in 2015, just three months after Ethereum’s mainnet went live. The project allowed users to buy up, sell and build on hexagonal swaths of digital land on a large map. It didn’t develop much of a following at launch and sat abandoned for years on the Ethereum blockchain until Adkisson saw the “fever pitch” developing around NFTs and started searching for the passcode to his old account.</p><p> 但在过去的几周里，叙述已经开始出现的洞，因为“Crypto考古学家”已经开始被遗弃地解除了在国内最早的日子中创造的被遗弃的NFT项目，至少有一个到达在加密之前到达。我们最近与Cyrus Adkisson谈到了一个名为Etheria的项目的创造者，他于2015年首次亮相，仅仅三个月后的Mainnet去了。该项目允许用户购买，销售和建立在大地图上的数字土地的六角形条子上。它并没有在推出中发出以下大部分时间，并且在Ethereum Blockchain上被遗弃了多年，直到Adkisson看到了NFTS周围的“发烧音调”，并开始搜索了他的旧帐户。</p><p> “I remember calling my parents toward the end of February, telling them I may be sitting on a goldmine here,” Adkisson told TechCrunch.</p><p> “我记得在2月底给我的父母打电话，告诉他们我可能会坐在这里的金矿上，”阿克西蒙告诉Te​​chCrunch。</p><p> After ultimately gaining access to his Etheria account, he then fired off a few tweets from Etheria’s long-dormant Twitter account, detailing that the bulk of the 914 tiles across two externally tradeable versions were still available and could be claimed for 1 Ether each. Adkisson says by the end of that weekend, his previously empty wallet was filled with $1.4 million worth of Ethereum.</p><p> 在最终获得访问他的Etheria帐户之后，他从Etheria的长期Twitter帐户中解雇了几个推文，详细说明了两个外部可交易版本的914个瓷砖的大部分仍然可用，并且可以要求保护1个以太网。 adkisson在该周末结束时说，他以前空的钱包充满了价值140万美元的以上的形象。</p><p> 1/ I hear that NFTs have become a thing. Here is some essential about Etheria, the first NFT project ever deployed to the Ethereum blockchain all the way back in October 2015 and presented at DEVCON1.  pic.twitter.com/aBZghPdFbS</p><p> 1 /我听说nfts已成为一件事。这是关于以太尼的一些必不可少的，第一个NFT项目一直在2015年10月返回Ethereum Blockchain，并在Devcon1上呈现。 pic.twitter.com/abzghpdfbs.</p><p> Age alone won’t make Etheria a hit; the major challenge from here is building up a community around the project that brings in more users and pushes the prices of land tiles higher. A tile recently sold for nearly $25,000 worth of Ether, but early adopters are struggling to balance waiting out the market’s development with liquidating enough tiles so that new users can get involved and the project can build hype.</p><p> 仅年龄不会使etsheria成为击中;这里的主要挑战是在项目周围建立一个社区，这些项目带来更多的用户，推动陆地瓷砖的价格更高。瓷砖最近出售了近25,000美元的以太，但早期的采用者正在努力平衡等待市场的发展，以使新用户可以参与其中，项目可以建立炒作。</p><p> “With these projects, it’s like, yeah, you have the historical context, but now you need to build a solid foundation with your communities because your real measure is not now, but it’s going to be what your community, size and engagement look like in a year,” says Allen Hena, an NFT enthusiast who helped  attract attention to the Etheria community last month with a series of blog posts.</p><p> “通过这些项目，它就像是，是的，你有历史背景，但现在你需要与你的社区建立一个坚实的基础，因为你的真实措施现在不是你的社区，但它将成为你的社区，尺寸和订婚是什么样的一年一年，“艾伦赫伦斯说，一位NFT爱好者，在上个月帮助吸引了对Etheria社区的注意力，一系列博客帖子。 </p><p> In the days following the project’s resurrection, the young community has already seen plenty of disagreement and infighting as Adkisson aims to maintain some level of control over the platform on which plenty have already pinned their retirement plans. Owners are mainly frustrated by Adkisson’s attempts to make an older version of Etheria externally tradeable, something that would likely make land tiles on the existing contracts considerably less valuable. Since our interview, Adkisson has left Etheria’s Discord server and admins in the group have vowed to continue on without him as he decides which direction he wants to take Etheria 1.0.</p><p>在项目复活的日子里，由于adkisson旨在维持对众多已经靠在退休计划的平台的平台维持某些程度的控制水平，这座年轻的社会已经看到了很多分歧和无法解释。业主主要受到adkisson试图制作外部交易的旧版本的较旧版本的东西，这可能会使现有合约的陆地瓷砖相当不那么有价值。自访谈以来，adkisson已离开Etheria的Discord服务器，在本集团的管理员发誓没有他在没有他的情况下继续，因为他决定他想要采取etheria 1.0的方向。</p><p> While punk owners we talked with are keeping an eye on these newly reemerged projects, they’re also skeptical that Etheria’s older status will do much to impact CryptoPunks’ value to NFT history.</p><p> 虽然我们与朋克所有者与这些新再生的项目进行了关注，但他们也持怀疑态度，以太亚的较旧状态将使Cryptopunks对NFT历史的价值影响很多。</p><p> “On paper it looks cool but it didn’t actually do anything for the community,” says user Daniel Maegaard. “CryptoPunks did all the hard work.”</p><p> “在纸上看起来很酷，但它实际上并没有为社区做任何事情，”用户Daniel Maegaard说。 “Cryptopunks做了所有的辛勤工作。”</p><p>  Maegaard, a 30-year-old crypto investor based in Brisbane, Australia, is more tied up in the value of CryptoPunks than most. He recently sold a particularly rare female “zero-trait” punk for more than $1 million. He’s also the owner of one of the rarest — some argue the rarest — punks, the only one with seven unique attributes, a qualifier that has earned it the nickname “7-atty” and a sacred place in punk lore. When he bought the punk for about $18,000 in Ethereum last year, it was the most anyone had ever paid. He isn’t keen to let it go anytime soon, saying he recently turned down a private offer for $4.2 million from a group of investors that hoped to tokenize the NFT and sell fractional shares of it to other users. Part of holding onto it is the potential for further gains, but the real reason, he says, is that he’s beginning to feel an emotional bond with his collection of digital files.</p><p>  Maegaard是一家位于澳大利亚布里斯班的30岁的Crypto投资者，比大多数人更加束缚在加密局部的价值。他最近卖掉了一个特别罕见的女性“零特质”朋克超过100万美元。他也是一个最稀有的所有者 - 一些争论稀有的 - 朋克，唯一一个有七个独特属性的人，这是一个获得绰号“7-Atty”和朋克洛洛的神圣地点的限定者。当他去年以21000美元购买了朋克时，这是任何人曾经支付的。他并不热衷于让它随时不再去，说他最近从一群投资者拒绝了420万美元的私人报价，希望赋予NFT并向其他用户出售分数份额。他说，持有它的一部分是进一步收益的潜力，但真正的原因是他说，他开始感受他的数字档案的情感联系。</p><p> “These little pixelated faces, it should be easy to give them up.
