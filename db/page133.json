"note_en": "With several thousand characters to contend with, how were the Japanese able to use typewriters before the advent of digital technology? The answer is the kanji typewriter ( \u548c\u6587\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc or  \u90a6\u6587\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc ), which was invented by Kyota Sugimoto in 1915. This invention was deemed so important that it was selected as one of the ten greatest Japanese inventions by the Japanese Patent Office during their 100th anniversary celebrations in 1985. Here are some photos of that first model.  (Photos courtesy Canon Semiconductor Equipment.)\n    To understand how the typewriter works, let\u2019s take a look at a more recent model (from  Wikipedia  \u2013  Click for a hi-res image):\n  The actual strikers that produce the type are all separate metal pieces, somewhat like movable type, arranged in a grid in the tray (1) beneath the typewriter.\n A handle (2) on the typewriter is used select the character to type from the list (3) of characters shown at the front of the typewriter. This handle is directly connected to the tray, and moves the tray relative to the fixed striking mechanism within the typewriter.\n On this particular model, there are two separate handles (4 and 5) for printing the character. One handle operates the mechanism that pulls the striker out of the tray and attaches it to the hammer, and the other handle is struck to propel the striker onto the ink ribbon, paper and platen. (I\u2019m not sure which handle is which.)\n  The following diagrams from the patent of the original 1915 model show the original mechanism. This uses a single handle to pickup the striker and then type the character in one action. (Click to enlarge)\n  The part labeled number 13 on the right side is the striker handle, and connects all the way through to the roller (number 19) on the left side. As 13 is pushed down, 19 lifts up, pivoting the long bar (20) under the typewriter and pushing the striker (32) out into the hammer.\n  As 13 is pushed further, 19 continues rising, pushing into part 24, which locks the striker into the hammer, and then strikes the hammer onto the platen.\n One of the things that made the typewriter difficult to use was getting the strike lever force correct. If struck with even just regular force, characters such as decimal points or punctuation would pierce the ribbon and paper, becoming stuck in the rubber platen. On the other hand, very complex characters (such as  \u66c7 or  \u9a5a) required striking with additional force to compensate for the large surface area of the typeface. This combined with the huge number of characters (which makes hunt and peck typing on a QWERTY keyboard seem trivial) meant that only experienced operators could use these typewriters.\n  In this 1928 model, a tractor-like mechanism is used in the character selection method. The dial at the front-left scrolled through the characters much like the caterpillar tread on a bulldozer. The price of this model was 190 yen, equivalent to approx. $US6000 in modern currency. (Note: Remaining photos reproduced with permission from  \u548c\u6587\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u3000\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc (Japanese only)).\n       The following 1942 model uses a felt roller to apply ink instead of an ink ribbon. The compact striking mechanism still retains much of the original 1915 design.\n   Another advance was the drum selection mechanism, as can be seen in this 1955 model by Toshiba.\n    And finally, a Toshiba model from 1981. Here the strikers are attached to the selection strips by springs. Once a particular strip has been selected out of the drum, the hammer swings around from behind to force the striker into the ink ribbon and paper.\n     Eventually, models were developed that used electrical striking mechanisms. This required a return to the tray of strikers design. The following models are from the 1980s.\n     The beginning of the end for Kanji typewriters was heralded by the arrival of affordable digital word processors in 1984. By the mid 90s, personal computers also began to become popular in Japanese homes, and the age of kanji typewriters came to an end. Although most have been discarded or lie idle gathering dust in storage, you can still find second-hand models for sale. ( Yahoo Auction Japan has some electric models.)\n Although Japanese typewriters are no longer manufactured, the company founded by Kyoka Sugimoto to manufacture his invention, the Nippon Typewriter Company ( \u65e5\u672c\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e), continues to exist in the form of Canon Semiconductor Equipment.\n I couldn\u2019t find any English language books on the subject, but technophiles may be interested in this  poster of a Japanese typewriter in action that I found on Amazon:", "posttime": "2021-07-26 06:41:29", "source_domain":

"note_en": "Coming from somewhere in Russia, a radio station has been baffling interested parties for decades. With its slightly changing, but constant broadcasts, the radio station UVB-76 has revealed very few, if any, of its secrets. Sure, its purpose may be as innocuous as a weather station, but the mystery surrounding it is irresistible.\n  UVB-76 is named for the start of most of the voice transmissions, at least in its first few decades. More recently, each transmission has begun with the presumed designation MD2hB. This change corresponded with a change in the radio station\u2019s rough transmission location. The location is definitely in Russia and was first traced to  Povarovo. Now, it is transmitting somewhere near Lozhki.\n The so-called UVB-76 is a radio station operating on the shortwave frequency 4625 kHz. The Russians call it \u201cThe Hummer\u201d and others know it as \u201c The Buzzer\u201d because of the sound it currently makes, which started as a blip. It emits about 25 buzz tones per minute at a near-constant rate. Each buzz lasts for about 1.2 seconds with a space of 1 to 1.3 seconds in-between. The only interruptions come from a voice speaking Russian. These used to be infrequent, but have become more frequent in the past two decades.\n  UVB-76 has been transmitting since the late 70s or early 80s, but definitely since at least 1982. There have been some changes in the buzzing and transmissions, but the broadcast has been near-constant since its discovery with little to no indication of its purpose. This begs the question, why has no one come forward to claim ownership.\n   All of UVB-76\u2019s voice transmissions seem to be in some sort of code that includes letters, numbers, and names. For example, the February 21, 2006 transmission went, \u201cUVB-76, UVB-76. 75-59-75-59. 39-52-53-58.5-5-2-5. Konstantin-1-9-0-9-8-Tatiana-Oksana-Anna-Elena-Pavel-Schuka. Konstantin-8-4. 9-5-5-Tatiana. Anna Larissa Uliyana-9-4-1-4-3-4-8.\u201d\n  It is assumed that the buzzing on UVB-76 occurs over an open mic. Occasionally, voices, music and other sounds have been picked up in the background. An excerpt from \u201cDance of the Little Swans\u201d was heard for 38 seconds on September 1, 2010. Phone conversations were heard off and on for about half an hour on November 11, 2010. These conversations picked up two instances of a person mentioning an officer on duty, which hints at a military purpose.\n  While there have been no concrete admissions of ownership or great evidence of its purpose, there have been some hints over the years. The former Lithuanian Minister of Communications and Informatics said that they transmit the voice messages to make sure the stations that receive the messages are paying attention. However, that does not explain the buzzing. Some have posited that the station is used for ionosphere research.\n   Perhaps the most plausible theory when it comes to this mysterious radio station, though it leaves much to be explained, is Russian military communications. The voice transmissions mentioning officers corroborate this. Furthermore, people claim to have found an abandoned military base near the first location, which contained paperwork showing a radio tower operated there on that frequency. However, this leaves you to wonder why they are saying nothing about the station if it is unimportant enough to leave paperwork laying around. If it is supposed to be secret, then why haven\u2019t they covered up the transmissions better?\n It is certainly odd that something as public as this radio station can still have so many secrets.

This week, he  walked the comment back: \u201cFacebook isn\u2019t killing people.\u201d The initial charge, some might argue, was nothing less than misinformation itself.\n The White House in recent weeks has been pushing Facebook and its peers \u2014 but especially Facebook \u2014 to throttle lies and propaganda about the vaccines that could finally put an end to this pandemic, if only more people trusted them. This ambition is understandable. While the shift from several prominent conservative commentators toward encouraging inoculation is promising, many more Internet influencers are continuing to peddle conspiracies. These misinformation mongers themselves are the most to blame. Yet platforms that allow them a place to spread their lies, and whose algorithms sometimes help those lies along, bear some responsibility.\n Where the administration is wrong is in suggesting that Facebook hasn\u2019t acknowledged this responsibility. The  company has plastered accurate information all over its properties, and it has taken as aggressive a line against inaccurate information about vaccines as it does against any other category of content. The reality is that fighting misinformation is hard because defining misinformation is hard: requiring moderators to find the fine, flickering line between the opinion of someone who says they don\u2019t approve of these vaccines and the provably false assertions of someone who says these vaccines kill.\n   Where Facebook is wrong is in using these difficulties as an excuse not to try harder. The company disputes the White House\u2019s references to a report on a so-called \u201cdisinformation dozen\u201d that finds 12 people were responsible for 65 percent of the covid-19 misinformation on the platform. Yet it  doesn\u2019t provide much meaningful data on, well, covid-19 misinformation on the platform \u2014 opting to tout only the 18 million misleading posts it has removed without saying anything about how many misleading posts it hasn\u2019t, and skirting entirely the question of who is seeing these posts where. Are lies spreading in clusters of pages and groups? What role does that pesky algorithm play? The New York Times reports that employees asked executives last year for more resources to measure precisely these prevalence statistics and that those resources were never approved.\n There\u2019s undoubtedly danger in letting people spew medical misinformation during a pandemic, especially when those people are repeat offenders. But there\u2019s danger, too, in the government painting a private company as a criminal culprit. Wielding these exaggerations as weapons to goad firms into compliance risks  giving cover to conservatives who seek to paint sites as unconstitutional censors, as well as to authoritarians abroad who actually seek to censor. By harnessing and sharing the data necessary to understand the spread of misinformation, both when it shows the platform succeeding and  when it shows it failing, Facebook would do everyone \u2014 including itself \u2014 a favor.\n      The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.", "posttime": "2021-07-26 05:54:56", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u534e\u76db\u987f\u90ae\u62a5,washington,facebook", "title": "\u534e\u76db\u987f\u90ae\u62a5", "title_en": "Washington Post", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/07/22/biden-is-wrong-about-facebook-so-is-facebook/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u534e\u76db\u987f\u90ae\u62a5", "facebook"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1069727, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "BorgBackup\uff08\u7b80\u79f0\uff1aBorg\uff09\u4e3a\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\uff1a \u7a7a\u95f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5907\u4efd\u5b58\u50a8\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8eab\u4efd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u3002\u538b\u7f29\uff1aLZ4\u3001zlib\u3001LZMA\u3001zstd\uff08\u81ea borg 1.1.4\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528 FUSE \u7684\u53ef\u5b89\u88c5\u5907\u4efd\u3002 ...\u5e76\u59cb\u7ec8\u68c0\u67e5\u60a8\u7684\u5907\u4efd\uff01", "note_en": "BorgBackup (short: Borg) gives you: Space efficient storage of backups.
