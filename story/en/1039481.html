Halloween was a fitting day for him to go; Millar loved practical jokes and spent far too much time doing silly things  like dropping dollar bills on the sidewalk and then hiding to see who would pick them up. But that was just a warm-up. In death, Millar unleashed his biggest prank ever — a last will and testament that was basically a giant social experiment. By promising a vast sum of money to the Toronto family that could have the most babies in a 10-year period, Millar set off a race to give birth the moment he died.</p><p>1926年10月31日，加拿大著名而富有的律师查尔斯·万斯·米勒（Charles Vance Millar）去世，享年73岁。 Millar喜欢恶作剧，并花了太多时间做一些愚蠢的事情，例如在人行道上丢下美元钞票，然后躲起来看看谁来接他们。但这只是热身。死后，米勒（Millar）释放了他有史以来最大的恶作剧-遗嘱和遗嘱基本上是一项巨大的社会实验。 Millar向多伦多家庭承诺提供一笔巨款，可能在10年内生育最多的婴儿，因此Millar发起了一场在他去世的那一刻就生育的竞赛。</p><p> Millar described his will as “necessarily uncommon and capricious” because he had “no dependents or near relations.” What Millar lacked in heirs, though, he made up for in cash and property. In addition to his work as a lawyer, Millar amassed a net worth of more than $10 million (in today’s Canadian dollars)  1 through a series of investments, including the property that would eventually be used for the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, one of the busiest crossings between the United States and Canada. He wanted to give that wealth away.</p><p> Millar将自己的遗嘱描述为“不必要且反复无常”，因为他“没有亲属或近亲”。不过，米拉尔没有继承人，但他用现金和财产来弥补。除了担任律师的工作外，Millar还通过一系列投资（包括最终将用于底特律-温莎隧道的财产）积累了超过1000万加元（以今天的加拿大元计算）1的净资产。美国和加拿大之间最繁忙的过境点。他想把那笔财富捐出去。</p><p>  But he wanted to do it in as roguish a way as possible. Millar started off by giving shares in a jockey club to gambling opponents and shares in a brewery to teetotalling religious leaders. Then he left his house in Jamaica to three men who hated one another, on the condition that they own it together. But those were just a prelude to the big finish. In clause 10, Millar revealed a biology and math challenge that would change the lives of dozens of Toronto families. The remainder of his fortune — about $9 million — would be bequeathed a decade later to “the mother who has since my death given birth in Toronto to the greatest number of children as shown by the registrations under the  Vital Statistics Act.” If there were a tie, he wanted his fortune to be divided equally among the winners.</p><p>  但是他想以一种尽可能鲁ro的方式做到这一点。 Millar首先是将赛马会的股份分给赌博对手，然后将啤酒厂的分给贪婪的宗教领袖。然后，他将自己在牙买加的房子留给了三个彼此憎恨的人，条件是他们在一起拥有房屋。但是，这些仅仅是大成就的序幕。在第10条中，Millar揭示了生物学和数学挑战，这将改变多伦多数十个家庭的生活。剩余的财产（约900万加元）将在十年后遗赠给“这位母亲，自从我去世以来，他在多伦多分娩了最多的孩子，这是根据《生命统计法》进行的登记所显示的。”如果要平分秋色，他希望自己的财富在获胜者之间平均分配。</p><p> Millar probably thought he was being clever; after all, childless people aren’t often responsible for baby booms. He may have even been making a wry statement in support of birth control — he was known to think that using contraception shouldn’t be the taboo it was. But he probably wasn’t thinking about what would happen to the losers and all the new mouths they would have to feed, and he certainly wasn’t thinking about the Great Depression, which would soon envelop Canada and the rest of the world. That historical coincidence drove an ever-larger and ever-more-desperate group of women to try to win Millar’s fortune. Soon the local papers, led by the Toronto Daily Star and The Evening Telegram, anointed it the Stork Derby.</p><p> Millar可能以为他很聪明。毕竟，没有孩子的人通常不会为婴儿潮而负责。他甚至可能发表过歪曲的言论来支持节育-众所周知，他认为使用避孕药不应成为禁忌。但是他可能没有考虑到失败者将会遭受的后果以及他们必须养活的所有新口，而且他当然也没有考虑到大萧条，它将很快席卷加拿大和世界其他地区。这段历史的巧合驱使越来越多，越来越绝望的女性群体试图赢得米拉的财富。不久，由《多伦多每日星报》和《晚间电讯报》领导的当地报纸将其涂为《鹳德比》。</p><p> As the years passed, the Derby faded into history, leaving behind just enough scraps for  Snopes-verified chain emails. In 1994, a graduate student at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, named Elizabeth Wilton wrote  her master’s thesis on the Derby and for the first time dug up and compiled the relevant court records. Wilton’s thesis was eventually used as source material for an overwrought  Canadian TV drama, but many of the details she unearthed are a previously untold gold mine for those of us trying to figure out how an extreme fertility contest could have played out.</p><p> 随着时间的流逝，Derby逐渐淡出了历史，只留下了足够的废料，供Snopes验证的链式电子邮件使用。 1994年，新斯科舍省哈利法克斯的达尔豪西大学研究生伊丽莎白·威尔顿（Elizabeth Wilton）在德比上写了硕士论文，并首次挖掘并整理了相关法院记录。威尔顿的论文最终被用作加拿大电视剧的剧本，但是她发现的许多细节对于我们这些试图弄清楚极端生育竞赛如何进行的人来说，以前是一个难以言喻的金矿。</p><p> In its most ruthless interpretation, the Stork Derby was a mathematical and biological challenge for the participating families. How could they maximize the number of babies they had?</p><p> Stork Derby用最残酷的诠释对参加者家庭构成了数学和生物学挑战。他们如何才能使所生婴儿数量最大化？</p><p>    For the past 170 years or so, much of the industrialized world has undergone what researchers call the  historical fertility transition, as economic incentives and labor practices changed to favor smaller families. The fertility rate has dropped precipitously during that time. Families went from having five or six kids in the 1800s to only about two today. Canada’s  current total fertility rate is only 1.59, well below replacement level.  2 (The rate in the U.S. is 1.87.) In 1926,  Canadian families averaged 3.36 children each. But when the Depression set in, the fertility rate dropped, to 2.80 by 1934 — much faster than the historical fertility transition would have predicted. According to  University of Minnesota economist Larry Jones, fertility rates dropped more during the Depression than during any other era in history, which is why he refers to those years as the “Baby Bust.”</p><p>    在过去的170年左右的时间里，许多工业化世界经历了研究人员所说的历史性生育转变，因为经济诱因和劳动方式发生了变化，以偏爱较小的家庭。在此期间，生育率急剧下降。家庭从1800年代的五个或六个孩子发展到今天的大约两个。加拿大目前的总生育率仅为1.59，远低于替代水平。 2（美国的比率为1.87。）1926年，加拿大家庭平均每个孩子有3.36个孩子。但是，当大萧条爆发时，生育率下降到1934年降至2.80，这比历史上的生育率转变所预期的要快得多。根据明尼苏达大学（University of Minnesota）经济学家拉里·琼斯（Larry Jones）的说法，大萧条期间的生育率下降幅度超过历史上任何其他时期，这就是为什么他将那些年称为“婴儿半身像”。 </p><p> If a woman could have had a baby the day the contest was announced and every nine months for the next decade, she would have ended up with 14 babies. But, of course, human reproduction doesn’t work that way. As  Jane Frederick, medical director of HRC Fertility, a clinic in Orange County, California, explained, conception is difficult, especially for new mothers. The likelihood of getting pregnant again depends on “if she breastfeeds and how much time her uterus is given to recover,” Frederick said. Many Derby contestants presumably weren’t breastfeeding regularly, as lactation often prevents ovulation; one study found that it’s as effective  as condom usage in preventing pregnancy for the first six months postpartum. And Stork Derby contestants weren’t resting their uteri for several months after each birth — many had two babies within a 12-month span. That meant the likelihood of miscarriage was higher.</p><p>如果一个女人可以在比赛宣布的那一天生一个孩子，然后在接下来的十年中每九个月生一个孩子，那么她最终将有14个孩子。但是，当然，人类繁殖并非如此。正如加州橙县诊所HRC Fertility的医学主管Jane Frederick所解释的那样，受孕很难，尤其是对于新妈妈。弗雷德里克说，再次怀孕的可能性取决于“她是否母乳喂养以及子宫恢复多少时间”。据推测，许多德比选手不定期母乳喂养，因为哺乳通常会阻止排卵。一项研究发现，它在预防产后前六个月的怀孕方面与使用避孕套一样有效。鹳德比（Stork Derby）的参赛者每次分娩后几个月都没有休息子宫-许多人在12个月内生了两个孩子。这意味着流产的可能性更高。</p><p> Even if the uterus has time to recover,  10 percent to 20 percent of known pregnancies end in miscarriages (and even more conceptions spontaneously abort before the woman knows she’s pregnant). Frederick emphasized that most of these miscarriages, especially among younger women, occur randomly. “The most common reason is genetic problems with the embryo; there’s not enough genetic information for it to go full term,” she said.</p><p> 即使子宫有恢复的时间，已知的怀孕也有10％到20％以流产而告终（甚至有更多的观念在妇女知道自己怀孕之前自然流产）。弗雷德里克（Frederick）强调指出，这些流产大多数是随机发生的，尤其是在年轻女性中。 “最常见的原因是胚胎的遗传问题。她说：“没有足够的遗传信息可以使它持续下去。”</p><p> When I asked Frederick how many babies a woman who was trying to maximize her fertility could expect to have in a decade without using modern fertility treatments, she said four to five if the woman was breastfeeding and up to seven if not.</p><p> 当我问弗雷德里克（Frederick）时，如果一个妇女试图在不使用现代生育方法的情况下最大程度地提高生育能力，那么十年之内有望生下多少个婴儿，她说如果该妇女正在母乳喂养，则有4到5个孩子；如果没有，则要增加7个孩子。</p><p>  Of course, there’s a shortcut to having lots of babies — have more of them at once.  Nadya Suleman, for example, had 14 kids (including one set of octuplets) in just nine years, from 2001 to 2009, using in vitro fertilization. Back in the 1930s, though, there was no IVF and no  Clomid or other fertility-increasing drugs. That meant that not only were there no chemical ways to increase the odds of getting pregnant, but women also were less likely to have twins (or triplets)  than women are today. Based on pictures and newspaper articles from the time, very few of the Derby contenders appeared to have had multiple births.</p><p>  当然，有很多孩子的捷径-一次生更多个孩子。例如，纳迪·苏莱曼（Nadya Suleman）在2001年至2009年的短短9年间，通过体外受精，生了14个孩子（包括一组八联体）。但是，早在1930年代，还没有试管婴儿，也没有克罗米德或其他提高生育力的药物。这意味着不仅没有化学方法可以增加受孕的几率，而且女性拥有双胞胎（或三胞胎）的可能性也比今天的女性低。根据当时的图片和报纸文章，很少有德比竞争者看来有多胎。</p><p> So what techniques could the Derby participants have used to increase their fertility? Besides mothers skipping breastfeeding, there were a few other ways to optimize the chances of getting pregnant, Frederick said. “Back in the 1920s, they didn’t know what the hormones were, but they did know that women cycled,” Frederick said. Shahin Ghadir, a fertility specialist at the  Southern California Reproductive Center, said this information would have given the families a crude sense of when they were most fertile. As for the men in the Derby families, Frederick said they could have increased their fertility by abstaining from sex and masturbation for the five days before intercourse. But even if a family had done everything it could to conceive as fast as possible, it comes down to whether the people trying to have a baby are a particularly fertile combination, Frederick said.</p><p> 那么Derby参与者可以使用哪些技术来提高他们的生育能力？弗雷德里克说，除了母亲不喂母乳外，还有其他一些方法可以提高怀孕的机会。 “在1920年代，他们不知道荷尔蒙是什么，但他们确实知道女性会骑自行车，”弗雷德里克说。南加州生殖中心的生育专家Shahin Ghadir表示，这些信息将使这些家庭对何时开始最肥沃有一种粗略的认识。至于德比家族中的男人，弗雷德里克说，在性交前五天，他们可以通过放弃性和手淫来增加生育能力。但弗雷德里克说，即使一家人尽其所能尽快怀孕，但要归结于试图生孩子的人是否特别富裕。</p><p> It’s unknown how many families decided to try to win Millar’s fortune. While there were a few mentions in the press early on, news coverage of the Derby didn’t really pick up until 1932, when the Ontario government tried to have the will nullified and the money given to the University of Toronto. After a huge public outcry — the Toronto Daily Star accused the government of resorting to “communism in the raw” — the government’s claim was withdrawn. At that point, several other women seem to have realized that their family size put them in contention and started to compete as well. By the deadline in 1936, more than two dozen Toronto families had welcomed at least eight babies during the previous decade.</p><p> 尚不清楚有多少家庭决定尝试赢得Millar的财富。尽管早期媒体上曾有过一些提及，但直到1932年，德比的新闻报道才真正开始兴起，当时安大略省政府试图废除遗嘱并将钱交给多伦多大学。在公众的强烈抗议之后（《多伦多每日星报》指责政府诉诸“生共产主义”），政府的主张被撤回。那时，其他几位妇女似乎已经意识到她们的家庭规模使她们陷入竞争，也开始竞争。到1936年的最后期限，在过去十年中，超过二十个多伦多家庭迎来了至少八个婴儿。</p><p> The Stork Derby eventually became a huge news story, perhaps since it provided an outlet from the miseries of the Depression. Those miseries were manifold. The Depression hit Canada almost as hard as it hit the United States.  Unemployment hit 19 percent. Total earnings in Toronto’s province  dropped 38.5 percent from 1929 to 1933. By 1935,  more than 25 percent of Toronto families relied on government relief.</p><p> Stork Derby最终成为了一个巨大的新闻故事，也许是因为它为摆脱大萧条的痛苦提供了一个出路。那些悲惨的经历是多方面的。大萧条对加拿大的打击几乎与对美国的打击一样严重。失业率达到19％。从1929年到1933年，多伦多省的总收入下降了38.5％。到1935年，超过25％的多伦多家庭依靠政府救济。 </p><p>  Many of the major Canadian papers covered the intricacies of the Derby, from new births among the leading families to the courtroom machinations of the Millar relatives as they aimed to stop the circus and keep the cash for themselves. Very few articles, though, focused on the toll that the contest would have on the desperately poor families trying to win. Newsweek, for example, first referred to participant Lillian Kenny as a contender for the Derby before noting that one of her babies had recently died from rat bites while living in ghastly poverty.</p><p>加拿大的许多主要报纸都报道了德比的错综复杂，从主要家庭中的新生到密拉尔亲戚在法庭上的阴谋诡计，目的是制止马戏团并为自己保留现金。但是，很少有文章关注比赛将给试图获胜的绝望贫困家庭带来的损失。例如，《新闻周刊》首先提到参与者莉莲·肯尼（Lillian Kenny）作为德比的竞争者，然后指出她的一个婴儿最近在可怕的贫困中死于老鼠咬伤。</p><p> Ten years after Millar’s death, 32 lawyers showed up to an initial hearing to claim a share of the fortune for the families they represented. After some quick record scanning, though, the presiding judge, William Middleton, cleared out everyone who didn’t have at least nine kids younger than 10. That left six families.</p><p> 米勒（Millar）死后十年，有32名律师出庭进行初审，要求为其所代表的家庭分担部分财富。经过快速的记录扫描后，首席法官威廉·米德尔顿（William Middleton）清除了所有人中至少有9个10岁以下的孩子。这留下了6个家庭。</p><p> But some mothers who had more than nine kids still weren’t allowed a shot at the prize. Pauline Clarke was one of them; she had 10 children within the timeline — the first five with her former husband and the second five with a different man, one she lived with after her separation from her husband. Middleton was not impressed. “‘Children,’ when used in any testamentary document, always means legitimate children,” he wrote in his judgment. Instead of $9 million, Clarke was eventually given a settlement of just over $200,000, and that came only after a lengthy lawsuit.</p><p> 但是仍然有一些育有9个以上孩子的母亲仍然无法获得奖品。宝琳·克拉克（Pauline Clarke）是其中之一。她在时间表中有10个孩子，前五个和她的前夫在一起，第二个五个和另一个人在一起，与丈夫分居后与她住在一起。米德尔顿没有留下深刻的印象。他在判决书中写道：“在任何遗嘱性文件中使用“儿童”，始终意味着合法儿童。最终，克拉克最终得到了200,000美元以上的赔偿，而不是900万美元，而这是经过漫长的诉讼之后才达成的。</p><p> As for the Kenny family, it eventually settled for the same amount that Clarke did. Although Lillian Kenny gave birth to 11 children, her claim was dismissed on the grounds that three of the babies were stillborn.  3 “A child born dead is not in truth a child,” Middleton wrote. “It was that which might have been a child.” With that, three of Kenny’s babies were scratched from the ledger. The youngest was named Charles Vance Millar Kenny, after his would-be benefactor.</p><p> 至于肯尼家族，它最终以和克拉克相同的价格和解。尽管莉莲·肯尼（Lillian Kenny）生育了11个孩子，但她的主张被驳回，理由是其中三个婴儿已死产。 3米德尔顿写道：“生下来的孩子实际上不是孩子。” “那可能是个孩子。”这样一来，肯尼（Kenny）的三个婴儿就从账本上划了出来。最小的名字是查尔斯·万斯·米勒·肯尼（Charles Vance Millar Kenny），是他的恩人。</p><p> Four other families with nine young children — the Timlecks, the Nagles, the Smiths and the MacLeans — were each awarded the equivalent of about $2 million. While she was in the midst of the Derby, Lucy Timleck took a moment to tell a reporter that raising a big family isn’t easy. “I think birth control is a wonderful thing,” she said in an article called  “‘Dark Horse’ in ‘Stork Derby’ Now Believes in Birth Control.” “I am sorry, in one way, that birth control information wasn’t available years ago. I know mothers who would have welcomed such knowledge.”</p><p> 另外四个有9个年幼子女的家庭-蒂姆里克，纳格尔斯，史密斯夫妇和麦克莱恩斯-各获得了相当于200万美元的奖金。露西·蒂姆莱克（Lucy Timleck）在德比（Derby）的比赛中花了一点时间告诉记者，要组建一个大家庭并不容易。她在《鹳德比》（Stork Derby）中的《黑马》（Dark Horse）一书中说：“我认为节育是一件了不起的事。” “很遗憾，以某种方式，几年前没有生育控制信息。我知道母亲会欢迎这种知识。”</p><p> Kevin Timleck, 52, is the son of Edward Timleck, who was Lucy’s youngest child. Kevin lives in Vancouver and told me that he has more than 100 first cousins spread out across the country. While many of his relatives have kept up the Timleck Irish Catholic tradition of having large families, Kevin has only two children. Why? “There’s no money involved in it,” he said.</p><p> 52岁的凯文·蒂姆莱克（Kevin Timleck）是露西最小的孩子爱德华·蒂姆莱克（Edward Timleck）的儿子。凯文（Kevin）住在温哥华，告诉我说他有100多个堂兄分布在全国各地。尽管他的许多亲戚都遵守了蒂姆莱克爱尔兰天主教徒拥有大家庭的传统，但凯文只有两个孩子。为什么？他说：“这不涉及任何金钱。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-dead-millionaire-convinced-dozens-of-women-to-have-as-many-babies-as-possible/">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-dead-millionaire-convinced-dozens-of-women-to-have-as-many-babies-as-possible/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/百万富翁/">#百万富翁</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/家庭/">#家庭</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
