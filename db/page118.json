At this point stateful APIshave pretty much proved to be a failure in terms of usability and performanceand many C++ programmers  prefer  *printf instead.\n However, format strings in C have a bad reputation because of lack of typesafety: users must encode type information together with formatting information.If the user-specified and actual types don\u2019t match we have an undefinedbehavior ( godbolt):\n  This prints part of a pointer as a decimal number, in other cases you can geta segfault or something worse.\n Fortunately, modern compilers can diagnose such errors at compile timefor literal format strings but this is an opt-in which is not ideal.Encoding type information by hand is not only error-prone but also cumbersome asthis table from the  documentation of the C  stdint.h header illustrates:\n   Formatting facilities in languages other than C are usually type-safe.For example, in Python you get an exception when trying to format a string asan integer:\n &gt;&gt;&gt;  &#39;{:d}&#39; . format ( &#34;I am not a number&#34; ) Traceback  ( most  recent  call  last ):  File  &#34;&lt;stdin&gt;&#34; ,  line  1 ,  in  &lt; module &gt; ValueError :  Unknown  format  code  &#39;d&#39;  for  object  of  type  &#39;str&#39;\n Moreover, format specifiers only convey formatting information and not typewhich makes the syntax much simpler and easier to parse, eliminating numerousunnecessary specifiers. For example,  d means format as decimal, not that thetype is  int and that it should be formatted as decimal.\n   (Note that Rust\u2019s formatting facility doesn\u2019t support  d for some reason so itis replaced with  x here.)\n  error[E0277]: the trait bound `str: LowerHex` is not satisfied --&gt; &lt;source&gt;:2:18 |2 | print!(&#34;{:x}&#34;, &#34;I am not a number&#34;); | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `LowerHex` is not implemented for `str` | = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `LowerHex` for `&amp;str` = note: required by `std::fmt::LowerHex::fmt` = note: this error originates in a macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)\n I\u2019ve been looking into doing the same in  the {fmt} library since around 2014 but the solution remainedelusive. One approach that has been available since  {fmt} 5.0 is based on  constexpr parameter emulation trick described in  this nice post by Michael Park:\n   The solution came from a somewhat unexpected (to me) place:  C++20  consteval.With C++20 it is now possible to write just ( godbolt)\n   &lt;source&gt;:4:14: error: call to consteval function &#39;fmt::basic_format_string&lt;char, char const (&amp;)[18]&gt;::basic_format_string&lt;char [5], 0&gt;&#39; is not a constant expression fmt::print(&#34;{:d}&#34;, &#34;I am not a number&#34;); ^.../include/fmt/core.h:2587:23: note: non-constexpr function &#39;on_error&#39; cannot be used in a constant expression if (spec != &#39;p&#39;) eh.on_error(&#34;invalid type specifier&#34;); ^.../include/fmt/core.h:2808:7: note: in call to &#39;check_cstring_type_spec(100, eh)&#39; detail::check_cstring_type_spec(specs_.type, eh); ^.../include/fmt/core.h:2456:12: note: in call to &#39;&amp;f-&gt;parse(checker(s, {}).context_)&#39; return f.parse(ctx); ^.../include/fmt/core.h:2718:39: note: in call to &#39;parse_format_specs(checker(s, {}).context_)&#39; return id &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; id &lt; num_args ? parse_funcs_[id](context_) : begin; ^.../include/fmt/core.h:2382:23: note: in call to &#39;&amp;checker(s, {})-&gt;on_format_specs(0, &amp;&#34;{:d}&#34;[2], &amp;&#34;{:d}&#34;[4])&#39; begin = handler.on_format_specs(adapter.arg_id, begin + 1, end); ^.../include/fmt/core.h:2407:21: note: in call to &#39;parse_replacement_field(&amp;&#34;{:d}&#34;[1], &amp;&#34;{:d}&#34;[4], checker(s, {}))&#39; begin = p = parse_replacement_field(p - 1, end, handler); ^.../include/fmt/core.h:2849:7: note: in call to &#39;parse_format_string({&amp;&#34;{:d}&#34;[0], 4}, checker(s, {}))&#39; detail::parse_format_string&lt;true&gt;(str_, checker(s, {})); ^&lt;source&gt;:4:14: note: in call to &#39;basic_format_string(&#34;{:d}&#34;)&#39; fmt::print(&#34;{:d}&#34;, &#34;I am not a number&#34;); ^.../include/fmt/core.h:616:29: note: declared here FMT_NORETURN FMT_API void on_error(const char* message); ^\n  The compile-time call stack similar to a runtime stack that you get in case of an uncaught exception. This part can potentially be simplified in the future.\n {fmt} is closer to Python than Rust because format specifications areextensible while in Rust you only have a handful of \u201cglobal\u201d specifiers.This is particularly useful for date and time formatting. Parsing of formatspecifications for user-defined types is done in  constexpr functions so thesame code is used both at compile time (for checks or format string compilation)and runtime.\n  The high-level API is very simple with the check done in an implicit  constevalconstructor of a format string:\n template  &lt; typename ...  T &gt; struct  format_string  {  string_view  str ;  template  &lt; typename  S &gt;  consteval  format_string ( const  S &amp;  fmt )  :  str ( fmt )  {  // Check if fmt is a valid format string for types T...  } } template  &lt; typename ...  T &gt; void  print ( format_string &lt; T ... &gt;  fmt ,  T &amp;&amp; ...  args );\n The implicit constructor is invoked whenever we call  print triggering thecheck. The actual work is done in the format string parser which is an ordinary constexpr C++ code not worth explaining here.\n  The compile-time checks for C++20  std::format have been accepted into the C++standard ( P2216) and arecoming to the standard library implementations near you. Until then you canof course use the {fmt} library which will include compile-time checks in theupcoming major release.\n  I was somewhat concerned that the compile-time check might be prohibitivelyexpensive. However, after enabling the feature in the {fmt}\u2019s test suite thatcontains a large number of formatting function calls the effect on build timewas very small, close to the natural variation between different builds.\n  Compile-time checks are cool but it\u2019s occasionally useful to have runtime formatstrings e.g. when translating messages with  gettext. It is still supported as an opt-in(the correct default in C++, shocking!) by wrapping a format string in fmt::runtime or using type-erased overloads like  vformat:\n  This makes runtime format strings clearly visible in code and misuses easy tocatch with a code review or tools.\n It is possible to do compile-time checks of format strings that are keys intoa translation database which eliminates the main use case for runtime ones butthat\u2019s a topic for another post.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 06:46:37", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5b89\u5168,safe,fmt", "title": "\u5bfb\u6c42\u5b89\u5168\u6587\u672c\u683c\u5f0f\u5316API ", "title_en": "A quest for safe text formatting API", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.zverovich.net/2021/06/16/safe-formatting-api.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5b89\u5168", "safe", "fmt"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1066952, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "varice robitaille\u6cd5\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3002 ashwin\u7684\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3002 Urdu\u7528\u738b\u56fd\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4fc4\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5e74\u4ec5\u4e3a2081\u5e74\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u7ec8\u4e8e\u5e73\u7b49\u4e86\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\uff06\uff0339; t\u53ea\u6709\u76f8\u5e73\u7684\u4e0a\u5e1d\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u3002\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u76f8\u7b49\u7684\u3002\u6ca1\u6709\u4eba\u806a\u660e\u7684\u522b\u4eba\u3002\u6ca1\u6709\u4eba\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u66f4\u597d\u770b\u3002\u6ca1\u6709\u4eba\u6bd4\u4efb\u4f55\u4eba\u66f4\u5feb\u6216\u66f4\u5feb\u3002\u6240\u6709\u8fd9\u4e00\u7b49\u5e73\u7b49\u90fd\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u5baa\u6cd5211,212\u548c213\u6b21\u4fee\u6b63\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f8e\u56fd\u969c\u788d\u5c06\u519b\u7684\u7279\u8bb8\u7ecf\u7eaa\u4eba\u7684\u4e0d\u65ad\u9057\u61be\u3002\n \u5173\u4e8e\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e8b\u60c5\u4ecd\u7136\u662fweren\uff06\uff0339;\u4f46\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\u56db\u6708\u798f\u6797\uff0c\u4ecd\u7136\u8ba9\u4eba\u4eec\u75af\u72c2\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6625\u5929\u3002\u5b83\u5728\u9648\u65e7\u7684\u6708\u4efd\uff0cH-G\u7537\u4eba\u4eec\u5750\u4e86\u4e54\u6cbb\u548c\u699b\u6811Bergeron\uff06\uff0339; Sfourteen\u5c81\u7684\u513f\u5b50\uff0c\u54c8\u91cc\u68ee\uff0c\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\n \u8fd9\u662f\u60b2\u60e8\u7684\uff0c\u597d\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u4e54\u6cbb\u548c\u699b\u5b50\u65e0\u6cd5\u60f3\u4e00\u60f3\u3002\u699b\u5b50\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u667a\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5979\u65e0\u6cd5\uff06\uff0339;\u9664\u4e86\u77ed\u6682\u7684\u7206\u53d1\u4e4b\u5916\u3002\u548c\u4e54\u6cbb\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u4ed6\u7684\u667a\u6167\u6b63\u5e38\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4ed6\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u6709\u4e00\u70b9\u7cbe\u795e\u4e0a\u7684\u969c\u788d\u6536\u97f3\u673a\u3002\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8981\u6c42\u4ed6\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f69\u6234\u5b83\u3002\u5b83\u88ab\u8c03\u6574\u4e3aagovernment\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u3002\u6bcf\u4e8c\u5341\u4e8c\u5341\u79d2\u5de6\u53f3\uff0c\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u4f1a\u53d1\u51fa\u4e00\u4e9b\u6025\u5267\u566a\u97f3\uff0c\u8ba9\u4eba\u4eec\u50cf\u4e54\u6cbb\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\n \u4e54\u6cbb\u548c\u699b\u5b50\u6b63\u5728\u770b\u7535\u89c6\u3002\u699b\u5b50\u4e0a\u6709\u6cea\u6c34\uff06\uff0339;\u8138\u988a\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5979\u53c8\u9057\u5fd8\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u610f\u601d\u3002\n  \u5728\u4e54\u6cbb\uff06\uff0339;\u5934\u90e8\u54cd\u8d77\u7684\u8702\u9e23\u5668\u3002\u4ed6\u7684\u601d\u7eea\u9003\u79bb\u4e86\u6050\u614c\u7684\u6050\u614c\u8b66\u62a5\u3002\n    \uff06\uff0334; yup\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u4e54\u6cbb\u8bf4\u3002\u4ed6\u8bd5\u56fe\u4ed4\u7ec6\u8003\u8651\u82ad\u857e\u821e\u5973\u6f14\u5458\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u771f\u7684\u975e\u5e38\u597d -

Hindi Translation by Ashwin.  Urdu Translation by RealMS  Russian translation   THE YEAR WAS 2081, and everybody was finally equal. They weren&#39;t only equalbefore God and the law. They were equal every which way. Nobody was smarterthan anybody else. Nobody was better looking than anybody else. Nobody wasstronger or quicker than anybody else. All this equality was due to the 211th,212th, and 213th Amendments to the Constitution, and to the unceasingvigilance of agents of the United States Handicapper General.\n Some things about living still weren&#39;t quite right, though. April forinstance, still drove people crazy by not being springtime. And it was in thatclammy month that the H-G men took George and Hazel Bergeron&#39;sfourteen-year-old son, Harrison, away.\n It was tragic, all right, but George and Hazel couldn&#39;t think about it veryhard. Hazel had a perfectly average intelligence, which meant she couldn&#39;tthink about anything except in short bursts. And George, while hisintelligence was way above normal, had a little mental handicap radio in hisear. He was required by law to wear it at all times. It was tuned to agovernment transmitter. Every twenty seconds or so, the transmitter would sendout some sharp noise to keep people like George from taking unfair advantageof their brains.\n George and Hazel were watching television. There were tears on Hazel&#39;s cheeks,but she&#39;d forgotten for the moment what they were about.\n  A buzzer sounded in George&#39;s head. His thoughts fled in panic, like banditsfrom a burglar alarm.\n    &#34;Yup,&#34; said George. He tried to think a little about the ballerinas. Theyweren&#39;t really very good-no better than anybody else would have been, anyway.They were burdened with sashweights and bags of birdshot, and their faces weremasked, so that no one, seeing a free and graceful gesture or a pretty face,would feel like something the cat drug in. George was toying with the vaguenotion that maybe dancers shouldn&#39;t be handicapped. But he didn&#39;t get very farwith it before another noise in his ear radio scattered his thoughts.\n  Hazel saw him wince. Having no mental handicap herself, she had to ask Georgewhat the latest sound had been.\n  &#34;I&#39;d think it would be real interesting, hearing all the different sounds,&#34;said Hazel a little envious. &#34;All the things they think up.&#34;\n  &#34;Only, if I was Handicapper General, you know what I would do?&#34; said Hazel.Hazel, as a matter of fact, bore a strong resemblance to the HandicapperGeneral, a woman named Diana Moon Glampers. &#34;If I was Diana Moon Glampers,&#34;said Hazel, &#34;I&#39;d have chimes on Sunday-just chimes. Kind of in honor ofreligion.&#34;\n     &#34;Right,&#34; said George. He began to think glimmeringly about his abnormal sonwho was now in jail, about Harrison, but a twenty-one-gun salute in his headstopped that.\n  It was such a doozy that George was white and trembling, and tears stood onthe rims of his red eyes. Two of of the eight ballerinas had collapsed to thestudio floor, were holding their temples.\n &#34;All of a sudden you look so tired,&#34; said Hazel. &#34;Why don&#39;t you stretch out onthe sofa, so&#39;s you can rest your handicap bag on the pillows, honeybunch.&#34; Shewas referring to the forty-seven pounds of birdshot in a canvas bag, which waspadlocked around George&#39;s neck. &#34;Go on and rest the bag for a little while,&#34;she said. &#34;I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re not equal to me for a while.&#34;\n George weighed the bag with his hands. &#34;I don&#39;t mind it,&#34; he said. &#34;I don&#39;tnotice it any more. It&#39;s just a part of me.&#34;\n &#34;You been so tired lately-kind of wore out,&#34; said Hazel. &#34;If there was justsome way we could make a little hole in the bottom of the bag, and just takeout a few of them lead balls. Just a few.&#34;\n &#34;Two years in prison and two thousand dollars fine for every ball I took out,&#34;said George. &#34;I don&#39;t call that a bargain.&#34;\n &#34;If you could just take a few out when you came home from work,&#34; said Hazel.&#34;I mean-you don&#39;t compete with anybody around here. You just sit around.&#34;\n &#34;If I tried to get away with it,&#34; said George, &#34;then other people&#39;d get awaywith it-and pretty soon we&#39;d be right back to the dark ages again, witheverybody competing against everybody else. You wouldn&#39;t like that, wouldyou?&#34;\n  &#34;There you are,&#34; said George. The minute people start cheating on laws, whatdo you think happens to society?&#34;\n If Hazel hadn&#39;t been able to come up with an answer to this question, Georgecouldn&#39;t have supplied one. A siren was going off in his head.\n     The television program was suddenly interrupted for a news bulletin. It wasn&#39;tclear at first as to what the bulletin was about, since the announcer, likeall announcers, had a serious speech impediment. For about half a minute, andin a state of high excitement, the announcer tried to say, &#34;Ladies andGentlemen.&#34;\n  &#34;That&#39;s all right-&#34; Hazel said of the announcer, &#34;he tried. That&#39;s the bigthing. He tried to do the best he could with what God gave him. He should geta nice raise for trying so hard.&#34;\n &#34;Ladies and Gentlemen,&#34; said the ballerina, reading the bulletin. She musthave been extraordinarily beautiful, because the mask she wore was hideous.And it was easy to see that she was the strongest and most graceful of all thedancers, for her handicap bags were as big as those worn by two-hundred poundmen.\n And she had to apologize at once for her voice, which was a very unfair voicefor a woman to use. Her voice was a warm, luminous, timeless melody. &#34;Excuseme-&#34; she said, and she began again, making her voice absolutely uncompetitive.\n &#34;Harrison Bergeron, age fourteen,&#34; she said in a grackle squawk, &#34;has justescaped from jail, where he was held on suspicion of plotting to overthrow thegovernment. He is a genius and an athlete, is under-handicapped, and should beregarded as extremely dangerous.&#34;\n A police photograph of Harrison Bergeron was flashed on the screen-upsidedown, then sideways, upside down again, then right side up. The picture showedthe full length of Harrison against a background calibrated in feet andinches. He was exactly seven feet tall.\n The rest of Harrison&#39;s appearance was Halloween and hardware. Nobody had everborn heavier handicaps. He had outgrown hindrances faster than the H-G mencould think them up. Instead of a little ear radio for a mental handicap, hewore a tremendous pair of earphones, and spectacles with thick wavy lenses.The spectacles were intended to make him not only half blind, but to give himwhanging headaches besides.\n Scrap metal was hung all over him. Ordinarily, there was a certain symmetry, amilitary neatness to the handicaps issued to strong people, but Harrisonlooked like a walking junkyard. In the race of life, Harrison carried threehundred pounds.\n And to offset his good looks, the H-G men required that he wear at all times a red rubber ball for a nose, keep his eyebrows shaved off, and cover his even white teeth with black caps at snaggle-tooth random.\n &#34;If you see this boy,&#34; said the ballerina, &#34;do not - I repeat, do not - try toreason with him.&#34;\n  Screams and barking cries of consternation came from the television set. Thephotograph of Harrison Bergeron on the screen jumped again and again, asthough dancing to the tune of an earthquake.\n George Bergeron correctly identified the earthquake, and well he mighthave - for many was the time his own home had danced to the same crashing tune.&#34;My God-&#34; said George, &#34;that must be Harrison!&#34;\n The realization was blasted from his mind instantly by the sound of anautomobile collision in his head.\n When George could open his eyes again, the photograph of Harrison was gone. Aliving, breathing Harrison filled the screen.\n Clanking, clownish, and huge, Harrison stood - in the center of the studio.The knob of the uprooted studio door was still in his hand. Ballerinas,technicians, musicians, and announcers cowered on their knees before him,expecting to die.\n &#34;I am the Emperor!&#34; cried Harrison. &#34;Do you hear? I am the Emperor!Everybody must do what I say at once!&#34; He stamped his foot and the studioshook.\n &#34;Even as I stand here&#34; he bellowed, &#34;crippled, hobbled, sickened - I am agreater ruler than any man who ever lived! Now watch me become what I canbecome!&#34;\n Harrison tore the straps of his handicap harness like wet tissue paper, torestraps guaranteed to support five thousand pounds.\n  Harrison thrust his thumbs under the bar of the padlock that secured his headharness. The bar snapped like celery. Harrison smashed his headphones andspectacles against the wall.\n He flung away his rubber-ball nose, revealed a man that would have awed Thor,the god of thunder.\n &#34;I shall now select my Empress!&#34; he said, looking down on the cowering people.&#34;Let the first woman who dares rise to her feet claim her mate and herthrone!&#34;\n  Harrison plucked the mental handicap from her ear, snapped off her physicalhandicaps with marvelous delicacy. Last of all he removed her mask.\n  &#34;Now-&#34; said Harrison, taking her hand, &#34;shall we show the people the meaningof the word dance? Music!&#34; he commanded.\n The musicians scrambled back into their chairs, and Harrison stripped them oftheir handicaps, too. &#34;Play your best,&#34; he told them, &#34;and I&#39;ll make youbarons and dukes and earls.&#34;\n The music began. It was normal at first-cheap, silly, false. But Harrisonsnatched two musicians from their chairs, waved them like batons as he sangthe music as he wanted it played. He slammed them back into their chairs.\n  Harrison and his Empress merely listened to the music for a while-listenedgravely, as though synchronizing their heartbeats with it.\n  Harrison placed his big hands on the girls tiny waist, letting her sense theweightlessness that would soon be hers.\n  Not only were the laws of the land abandoned, but the law of gravity and thelaws of motion as well.\n   The studio ceiling was thirty feet high, but each leap brought the dancersnearer to it.\n  And then, neutraling gravity with love and pure will, they remained suspendedin air inches below the ceiling, and they kissed each other for a long, longtime.\n It was then that Diana Moon Glampers, the Handicapper General, came into thestudio with a double-barreled ten-gauge shotgun. She fired twice, and theEmperor and the Empress were dead before they hit the floor.\n Diana Moon Glampers loaded the gun again. She aimed it at the musicians andtold them they had ten seconds to get their handicaps back on.\n  Hazel turned to comment about the blackout to George. But George had gone outinto the kitchen for a can of beer.\n George came back in with the beer, paused while a handicap signal shook himup. And then he sat down again. &#34;You been crying&#34; he said to Hazel.\n        &#34;That&#39;s my girl,&#34; said George. He winced. There was the sound of a rivettinggun in his head.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 06:46:08", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "finally,\u54c8\u91cc\u68ee",

value companies. They should stop LARPing about \u201cvalue add\u201d, \u201cdeal flow\u201d, and \u201caccess \u201c.\n Public-market investors are comfortable telling you what they do: buy stocks low and sell them high. But Venture Capital investors who do the exact same thing \u2014 buy equity in startups at what they think is a low price, and exit higher \u2014 seem much less comfortable talking honestly about their job. When they talk to founders and LPs, they pretend to be something they\u2019re not. I call this VC LARPing.\n   VCs act like offering non-monetary value is a big part of their job. VCs will try sell you on value-adds like:\n  Sure, a   VC adds some value beyond their money. But the value-add illusion cracks when, instead of treating it as priceless, you ask yourself to quantify how much it\u2019s worth.\n  Stalin observed that \u201cquantity has a quality all its own\u201d, and this is true for VC value-add. If you want a specific type of value-add, all you need to do is raise a larger quantity of money. You can use money to purchase the specific thing you need.\n   Let\u2019s flip the situation around and apply the  reversal test. Imagine you\u2019ve already raised $10M from a no-name VC, DumbMoney Capital. A week later, you hear that Sequoia is considering acquiring DumbMoney VC and making it part of Sequoia. You call up Sequoia and say \u201cHey, I would love to have Sequoia on my cap table. Is there anything I can do to convince you to go through with your acquisition of DumbMoney VC?\u201d They say, \u201cSure, we\u2019re willing to do it, but we\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s worth it. If you sweeten the deal for us, we\u2019re willing to do it.\u201d\n     WHAT? You\u2019re going to wire Sequoia $1M just so they can offer you some advice and connections from time to time? This is a ridiculous offer.\n But\u2026 flip the situation back around. This is exactly what Sequoia is saying when they say you should give them favorable terms in your funding round, that you should accept 20% less money than the lower-tier VCs, for a given percentage of equity because they\u2019re \u201csmart money\u201d. It\u2019s not prudent for you as CEO to write a $1M check without understanding exactly how you\u2019re going to get your money\u2019s worth, because most of the time you\u2019ll be overpaying.\n   VCs talk a lot about their reputation. Reputation is a big part of the amorphous \u201cvalue-add\u201d concept. Sequoia, for example, has made tons of money by making smart choices about which startups to invest in. Because of this, they\u2019ve earned a great reputation as a \u201cTier 1\u201d VC.\n Who wouldn\u2019t want to brag that Sequoia is on their cap table? Doesn\u2019t having that \u201cTier 1\u201d name inspire confidence when you\u2019re trying to sell employees on your company, partners, other investors, etc?\n Sure. But you have to quantify how much it\u2019s worth, which is a very finite amount. If you want to hire a great employee, don\u2019t give up $1M of cash that you could have in your bank, just so you can brag about your VC\u2019s reputation. That would be overvaluing Sequoia\u2019s reputation. There are better ways to deploy $1M to attract top-tier employees, such as using it to pay higher salaries for those employees.\n  VCs will try to convince you that you should take their money because they\u2019ll be a great board member for you, while if you take money from someone else, you\u2019ll end up with someone greedy and incompetent on your board.\n Sure, if you have to pick a VC to go on your board, you should definitely choose a good VC over a bad one. But if you\u2019re pondering which VC to add to your board, you\u2019ve already been tricked into \u201cthinking past the sale\u201d and accepting the premise that selling equity in your company requires adding a VC to your board.\n Why do VCs want you to give them a board seat? So that they can use that power to make decisions that serve the interest of the VC, in opposition to the interests of the founder, and even in opposition to the interests of the company.\n But why should VCs expect you to agree to give them a board seat? Frankly, they shouldn\u2019t. The founders should choose the best board members for the company they want to build, without constraining their choice to a VC. If the founder happens to choose a VC, to choose the same person who invested in their company, great. But let\u2019s not conflate two very different VC functions: valuing whether a company is well-priced, vs making decisions about how to run a company. VCs should stick to the former.\n In other words, VCs should invest if and only if they think the founder\u2019s company, managed by a founder-selected board, is a good investment for the price.\n  So far we\u2019ve talked about how VCs are LARPing to founders. Now let\u2019s talk about how VCs are LARPing to their limited partners (LPs). VCs are desperate to justify to their LPs why they\u2019re taking a 2%/yr management fee and 20% carry. Ideally, they\u2019d just make a case for their superior abilities to identify startups that are attractively priced. But since those core abilities are so often weak or nonexistent, VCs resort to LARPing once again.\n  VCs tell their LPs that they have a \u201cdeal flow\u201d advantage. Supposedly, they \u201csee more deals\u201d than other VCs, because the best founders reach out to them and not to others. Sounds plausible, but take a moment to think about it\u2026 do you see any problem with this claim?\n The best founders understand that they\u2019ll get the best fundraising terms if they create a bidding war with as many participants as possible. Aaron Harris advises founders to  \u201capproach every fundraising as an auction\u201d.\n Aaron was a partner at Y Combinator, which is known for hosting Demo Day, which is a direct attack on the concept of proprietary VC deal flow. All VCs are looking at the same list of YC companies before and during Demo Day. There\u2019s no proprietary deal flow. To the extent that non-YC companies are still hard to identify, that\u2019s a temporary advantage, a relic from a time when startup fundraising was a niche with a small number of gatekeepers. It\u2019s not relevant in the context of a large abundant capital market, which is what we have today, and what we\u2019ll always have in the future.\n  One of VCs\u2019 favorite claims is that they have superior \u201caccess to deals\u201d. The claim is that founders will take their money more than the competition\u2019s money, because they (the VC) have a strong reputation of adding value and being founder-friendly.\n But actually, the whole concept of \u201caccess to deals\u201d, to the extent it\u2019s even a meaningful claim, isn\u2019t something to be proud of. It implies that the VC is siphoning value away from founders who don\u2019t know better.\n  Let\u2019s say Hotshot Capital and DumbMoney VC both offer term sheets of a $10M investment at $50M post. Hotshot Capital wants its LPs to think it has better \u201caccess\u201d in situations like this; that the founder will take their term sheet over DumbMoney\u2019s term sheet. But wait, what if DumbMoney raises their offer to $11M at $55M post? In that case, taking DumbMoney\u2019s offer is equivalent to taking Hotshot\u2019s offer and then getting an extra free gift of $1M cash deposited into the company\u2019s bank account.\n DumbMoney should be able to win this deal by raising its cash bid. So what happened to Hotshot\u2019s \u201caccess\u201d?\n If a founder is smart enough to assign an overall numerical price to two term sheets, quantifying all the factors including board structure, employee equity pool dilution, VC\u2019s advisory value-add, etc, then the founder will tell DumbMoney how much extra cash they need to add to their offer in order to beat Hotshot\u2019s bid, and it won\u2019t be much more than $1M.\n Therefore Hotshot is kidding its LPs by claiming \u201caccess\u201d as a serious advantage. The only time \u201caccess\u201d works is on gullible founders who think they shouldn\u2019t shop around Hotshot\u2019s term sheet. I wouldn\u2019t call that \u201caccess\u201d, I\u2019d call that gaslighting founders into having a below-market self-worth.\n  The non-LARPing part of a VC\u2019s job is  valuing startups. Valuing a company is a valuable contribution to society. It\u2019s allocating society\u2019s capital to the startups who will use it the most effectively to yield the highest returns. And it compensates the VC handsomely for their effort.\n VCs love talking about supporting founders. Well, if you want to support founders in an authentic way that\u2019s actually in your job description, in such a way where incentives are aligned rather than a fake LARPing display, then just focus on being a good investor: identify a startup\u2019s potential for success and bid for the chance to invest, thereby raising the company\u2019s valuation.\n  The clock is running out on how much longer VCs can keep LARPing, because early-stage startup funding is rapidly changing from a restricted activity into a free and liquid market.\n We all know what a free and liquid market looks like: it looks like the public equity market. For instance:\n When you want to buy a public stock you just look it up, see what the market price is, and buy it if you think it\u2019s worth more than that price. There\u2019s no question of whether you have \u201caccess\u201d to the trade.\n When you buy equity in a public company, you might be a helpful value-added investor to that company, but that doesn\u2019t change the price you pay for its shares. If you want to get compensated for your value-add services, you make a separate contract.\n When you buy a public stock, you can sell it any time. You\u2019re not forced to hold it for years.\n  The invention of the SAFE note has empowered startups to engage in \u201chigh-resolution fundraising\u201d, selling their equity to one investor at a time without the need to coordinate a single \u201clead investor\u201d who sets fixed terms for a large \u201cround\u201d.\n General Solicitation and equity crowdfunding up to $5M have recently been legalized in the US. On sites like OurCrowd and SeedInvest, companies can broadcast their fundraising pitch to millions of individual investors, completely eliminating any deal flow advantages that VCs might claim.\n AngelList syndicates allow startups to broadcast their pitches to thousands of accredited investors, who can then invest with just a couple clicks, as easily as investing in stocks on Robinhood.\n CartaX is helping startups run secondary auctions to help shareholders liquidate their holdings whenever they want.\n Startup investing will ultimately become as free and liquid as public-market investing. There will eventually be a single place where you can look up any startup, see its price ticker, and trade on it.\n These trends are sure to continue because they benefit everyone except for the VCs who are focused on LARPing rather than on valuing companies. So while VC LARPing is common today, it won\u2019t be for much longer.\n  I\u2019ve been picking on VCs, but you know what, founders are guilty of LARPing too:  80% of startups don\u2019t even have a coherent value prop.\n If you liked this post, check out  my startup blog or follow me on  Twitter.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 06:45:37", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker

use Quad9 normally, no data containing your IP address is ever logged in any Quad9 system. Connections can employ encryption if your system supports it, and the entire Quad9 platform has been designed to be GDPR-compliant from the first public announcement in 2017.\n  Every transaction on the Internet starts with a DNS event. This name lookup reveals critically sensitive data about the person triggering that transaction. The nature of those name lookups has created a strong and dangerous motivation for commercialization of personal data from DNS recursive resolver services. Quad9 is the only large DNS resolver with a founding charter that includes privacy as a primary goal, and the Quad9 team is devoted to the concept of keeping personal data under the control of the end user.\n  Quad9\u2019s organizational move to Switzerland is important for the free and open internet because it provides much-needed geographic and legal diversity in the open DNS resolver space. It also shows that Quad9 is actively seeking to work within the legislative framework that best serves the privacy of its users.I support the Quad9 open resolver because it puts the end user first and helps build a secure and private internet without collecting \u2013 and therefore without the possibility of commercializing \u2013 users\u2019 personal information. I believe Quad9\u2019s philosophy of openness and transparency in handling users\u2019 data resonates strongly with the core beliefs of our community.\u201d\n I\u2019m really impressed by the privacy architecture of Quad9. In addition to providing great security as a DNS resolver, Quad9 doesn\u2019t collect or retain personal data. Now, it is relocating to Switzerland, where it will become subject to the rigors of Swiss data protection law, which is similar to GDPR. In addition, it obtained findings of law from the Swiss government whereby it won\u2019t be required to retain personal information, nor will it be subject to requests from law enforcement or national security\u201d\n  Quad9 routes your DNS queries through a secure network of servers around the globe. The system uses threat intelligence from more than a dozen of the industry\u2019s leading cybersecurity companies to give a real-time perspective on what websites are safe and what sites are known to include malware or other threats. If the system detects that the site you want to reach is known to be infected, you\u2019ll automatically be blocked from entry \u2013 keeping your data and computer safe.\n  For the Internet to be an effective tool, users must trust their ability to use online services without fear of theft, fraud, or misuse of their devices by criminals. Public and private network operators need protection against malicious use of infrastructure resources and attacks against their users or customers. Quad9\u2019s mission is to improve the security and stability of the Internet to allow everyone to be less vulnerable to risks and more effective in their daily online interactions.\n  Quad9 can be used simply by setting the DNS server settings for your device to the addresses given in  one of our service profiles. No sign-up is required, no account data needs to be given to Quad9, and there is no contract. Quad9 is free to use and collects no personal data about you. You can configure your router or wifi access point to distribute these settings, which will extend protection to all the elements on your local network including IoT devices, many of which otherwise would not have any anti-malware defenses.\n  Quad9 is a not-for-profit organization, relying on grants and partnerships with commercial and non-commercial sources and from individuals. Your use of Quad9 may prevent a ransomware attack, prevent your bank account from being compromised, or protect your laptop from being used as part of an illicit criminal attack on others.

The family said their thermostat had been changed remotely, raising the temperature of their home during a three-hour \u201cenergy saving event.\u201d\n  The family\u2019s smart thermostat was installed a few years ago as part of a new home security package. Many smart thermostats can be enrolled in a program called &#34;Smart Savers Texas.&#34; It&#39;s operated by a company called  EnergyHub.\n  The agreement states that in exchange for an entry into sweepstakes, electric customers allow them to control their thermostats during periods of high energy demand.

There was a time and a place for me to play the punditry game with Apple, but I feel like that was years ago in a much different time and place. I spent 17 years at Apple, and boy, do I have opinions about the place, both how it was and how it is, but I also sometimes remind myself it was almost that long ago that I left, and things change. I changed.\u00a0  Does the world need one more Apple pundit? God, no, there are so many people with so many opinions I mostly sit on the sidelines and don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the time to try to get heard above the noisy of the mob that circles around Apple with their endless hot takes. (To answer a question I get every so often: the way I stay up to date on Apple these days is I pay attention to what Jason and Dan write at  Sixcolors.com, and what Jason and Myke talk about on the  Upgrade podcast. They connect me to basically everything I feel I should know about with Apple, and give me good, thoughtful opinions about the things they discuss and point to.\u00a0  I am still very much embedded in that ecosystem, and I have never seriously considered doing anything else, and I at this point never expect to. I depended on my iPhone even when I was working and evangelizing a phone that wanted to pretend it was competing with Apple (but honestly, we never really did). That doesn&#39;t mean I love, or even like, everything Apple does. But mostly I think Apple is doing good things, most of the time.\u00a0   The Apple Silicon Transition  One thing I think Apple is doing very well: the transition to Apple Silicon (aka the ARM chips). I replaced my fairly recent Apple 16&#34; Macbook Pro with the M1 Macbook Air, and it works wonderfully well. As someone who lived through the 68K -&gt; PowerPC transition, was leaving Apple in the early days of the PowerPC -&gt; Intel transition, and for good measure had to survive the Classic MacOS -&gt; MacOSX transition, I&#39;ve seen this floorshow before. Apple is knocking this one out of the park.\u00a0  In day to day use, the M1 laptop blows away the 16&#34; pro -- which I loved and which Laurie now has and uses. There are a few places where it&#39;s consumer designs appear, and the one way I can systematically drag it down to a crawl is by telling Lightroom to do multiple compute intensive things at once: for instance, a common operation for me is to import a bunch of photos, then set up Lightroom to convert them all to DNG, and build 1:1 and Smart profiles for each. The 16&#34; handles this load fine; the M1 slogs and struggles, because Adobe makes no attempt to recognize overload conditions and self-throttle. If I do them serially, all is fine, but multiple, independent compute intensive threads can kick the computer in the kneepcap.\u00a0  This doesn&#39;t bother me, because I expected it and it&#39;s avoidable with some thought (one might wish Adobe would make their background processing smarter, but, well, it&#39;s Adobe). And it&#39;s a great example of the difference between the higher end Intel chips in the Macbook pro, and the M1 Macbook air: the M1 is way better at 99% of what I use it for, but it has its limitations -- limitations which were obvious and expected, and limitations which will be removed when Apple brings out newer, more powerful chips.\u00a0  This is a place where I think many of the so-called pundits fell down in their discussions about Apple; they look at the M1 and complain about its limits, not seeming to understand this isn&#39;t the best Apple can do, it&#39;s the first that Apple did. The M1 is \u00a0a great entry level chip for good entry level systems, and a strong indication of what&#39;s possible in this new Apple Silicon era as Apple improves and matures its chips. If you follow a pundit that couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t see this basic idea, you really need to upgrade your pundits.\u00a0  So far, the software translation that allows Intel software to work has, well, just worked. It&#39;s been flawless. Way better than the first generation of Rosetta tools we lived with in previous transitions.  My plan, in fact, is when the rumored 30&#34; iMacs come out, with hopefully a more pro-sumer capable CPU (M1x or M2?) I&#39;ll be adding one to the clan and make that my primary computer, with my laptop going back to pure mobile use. We&#39;ll probably replace Laurie&#39;s iMac, also, and then at some point I&#39;ll likely upgrade back to a Macbook Pro and she&#39;ll get this M1 Air.\u00a0   Other Products  I love my iPhone, although once again, my &#34;plan&#34; to get serious about using it for photography has fallen victim to this &#34;I have no time to spare to invest in learning this&#34; thing. I like my iPad, but it is very much a consumption device for me, so I&#39;m not demanding more of it than it&#39;s able to offer me, and I fully agree with and support the people who complain about how much more limited the OS is than the hardware could potentially offer. I wonder why they put an M1 in an iPad, when to me, all it does is highlight how much less an iPad can do than my M1 Macbook can -- although there are various aspects of how I use an iPad where I much prefer it to my Mac. But the iPad is still trying to figure out how to be a mature platform, and in many ways, falling short. I also note I haven&#39;t touched my Apple Pencil since about a month after I bought it with my latest iPad model -- it just doesn&#39;t sync into how I work with the device.\u00a0  Yet. (see: &#34;this year, I&#39;m going to get serious about using iPhones in my photography&#34;)  I love my Apple Watch. First thing I do -- before getting out of bed in the morning -- is put it on. Last thing I do, as I sit on the edge of the bed, is take it off so it can charge. I struggle to find a watch face I love, but I have some I like, and that&#39;s more than good enough for someone like me. Rene Ritchie once said that the Apple Sports Band was the yoga pants of watchbands, and well, yes, I wear my watch with one of those bands 100% of the time, because it&#39;s nice and comfortable and that&#39;s what I want. Fashionista I am not, nor do I ever want to be...  Other Apple Hardware is less successful for me. I own a Homepod, and mostly, I forget it&#39;s there and I forget to tell my devices to send audio to it. If it were to fail, I wouldn&#39;t replace it. I was for a long time a big supporter of the Apple TV, but when the one in my office failed, I replaced it with a Roku. the only reason we still have an Apple TV in the house is because it hasn&#39;t failed yet, and we frankly never use it any more. Apple took this product down the wrong paths, and it&#39;s become irrelevant as far as I&#39;m concerned. And Earpods -- I just bought a new pair when my older pair finally became somewhere beyond unreliable and trending into broken. For the last couple of months, I&#39;ve been kind of down on them, but with a new pair that is working properly, I&#39;m a lot happier with them now. I did, in fact, buy a replacement pair, but I don&#39;t make them my only/default hearing device; I still prefer my Bose QC35&#39;s when I&#39;m in my office, and I use the earpods for phone calls and when I&#39;m mobile. I don&#39;t love wearing the earpods for multiple hours at a time, but that&#39;s probably my biggest complaint about them.  If I were to assign letter grades, how about these: Apple Silicon Macs A, Intel Macs B, iPads: B-, the iPhone a B+, Homepod gets a boring C, Apple TV gets a D, and Earpods get a B-. Overall, not bad results for Apple.   Software  When it comes to Apple&#39;s software, though, I have some bigger gripes. One of the big draws of App&#39;e&#39;s infrastructure is how apps can integrate and move data around between sets of related apps. Given that idea, though, why is it I feel like I&#39;m always looking for a better third party app than the standard Apple one? I&#39;m talking about apps like Mail, like Calendar and the Contacts app specifically.\u00a0  I currently use Spark as my mail client. It&#39;s been -- fine -- but I&#39;m about to shift back to the app I used before I was tired of it&#39;s glitches and moved to Spark, which is Airmail. I&#39;m shifting away from Spark because I&#39;m tired of its glitches and want to see if Airmail is less glitchy now. I&#39;m betting -- not. But still, I keep hoping.\u00a0  Apple Mail? I really want to like it. I don&#39;t dislike it, actually, and every so often I use it for a while, but it&#39;s missing some key features (like snooze) I&#39;d like to have, and it feels -- fine. It&#39;s a fine app that is also more or less forgettable.\u00a0  How to define how I feel about the Mail app? Remember back in high school or college that cute person you worked up the the nerve to ask out on a date, and they spent the entire evening looking disinterested and killing any attempt at conversation with one or two word answers and silences? That&#39;s Apple Mail to me; they&#39;re a nice person and all, but... there&#39;s nothing I feel like building a relationship around. I&#39;ve tried it enough times to know I don&#39;t want to try again unless Apple does something that really convinces me they&#39;ve spent time understanding what a modern mail app should be. I&#39;m not holding my breath. For a calendar I use  Fantastical, and love it and pay for it willingly. For contacts? Allow me to exhale a deep, loud sigh. I&#39;ve been using Busycontacts for a while, and it&#39;s -- it&#39;s fine, just like Apple Mail is fine. And the Fantastical people just bundled Cardhop with Fantastical, so I&#39;ve been working with it for the last week, and it&#39;s actually a pretty good app, but it works in ways I don&#39;t like, where I can honestly say &#34;it&#39;s not you it&#39;s me&#34;, so I&#39;ve uninstalled it again (for the third time). And since I can be equally uninspired by both Apple&#39;s Contacts app and Busycontacts, I&#39;ve decided it&#39;s time to go back to Apple&#39;s Contacts app again. (edit later: or more correctly, I tried for about an hour, and I&#39;m back with Busycontacts because there were just too many issues with the contacts app) For a while. Until I meet some new contacts app and take it out for a spin, hoping it&#39;ll actually do what I&#39;d like a Contacts app will do.\u00a0  These apps are a good example of an ongoing problem I think Apple hasn&#39;t taken seriously enough: they commit resources to build something and they promote that thing with marketing and keynotes and all of the hype -- and then many of those things get stuffed in a closet and mostly ignored year after year as the market moves forward and innovates. Apple Mail is a great example of a really good email app if it was ten years ago, and remember Apple&#39;s Airport wifi devices? Apple&#39;s long neglect of them is why I&#39;m a pretty happy user of Eero these days.\u00a0  But in the case of something like a mail app, Apple giving a basic app away for free inhibits other developers from tackling that idea, and limits their ability to make enough money to warrant doing the hard investment in doing a real killer version of an app of that type. I do wish Apple would choose to either commit hard to an app and make it best of show, or kill the app and open the market to other companies. Instead, they do a middle policy of doing minimal work on an adequate app, making it harder for non-Apple apps to thrive, but not really serving the needs of the users very well, either.\u00a0  Itunes -- oh, sorry, Apple Music -- is another app like this. A number of years ago I wrote a piece that described it as a dumpster fire. Now? It feels like a dumpster fire where Apple closed one half of the dumpster lids, declared victory and went off to design even more interesting iPhones instead.\u00a0  Apple, I think, has too many things they&#39;ve built and committed to market and not enough resources committed to properly maintain and push them forward. Whether it&#39;s the Apple Airports or the Apple TV, which I think Tim Cook should just retire and embrace the Apple TV software on other devices -- or software like Mail that goes years without any significant innovation -- there are parts of Apple&#39;s ecosystem that seem to go on idle for years at a time, and where Apple simply doesn&#39;t care enough or have enough resources to commit to doing those bits and pieces justice. And because of it, its users are not as well served as Apple users deserve to be.\u00a0  A side aspect of this &#34;benign neglect?&#34; thing I see is that software quality at Apple, which for years was rock solid, has become more hit and miss. I do believe Apple has figured this out and I do believe they&#39;re working on it -- but I also believe the results have been spotty. I&#39;m one of those people who still install updates when tehy&#39;re released -- for the most part, and maybe a few hours after the real early adopters have had a chance to bleed their edges first -- but I&#39;ve become more and more hesitant about that in the last few years. I should trust Apple&#39;s software quality, and for a long time I did, but now? I hesitate more, because I&#39;ve hit too many rough edges.\u00a0   The Podcast App and Paid Podcasts  Recently, Apple made a lot of noise about Podcasts and the Podcasts app. And you know what? If you look up &#34;adequate app&#34; in the dictionary, the Podcast app logo will be \u00a0there, because that&#39;s exactly what that app is. So since Apple seems to be getting serious about podcasts (finally), did they invest in making the podcast app great?\u00a0  No. They created a system of paid podcasts, which can be listened to only in their podcast app. They didn&#39;t innovate to an app you want to use, they built a service that tries to force you to use it. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s good for those podcasters who choose to sign up for that service, and I don&#39;t expect that service to thrive or ever be a major player in podcasts -- and I don&#39;t think Apple has done its users any favors by playing this exclusive content game.\u00a0  It&#39;s an example of a bad trend I see out of Apple, a refusal to embrace and compete in existing market areas, but instead trying to use their existing ecosystem to force people into exclusive relationships with Apple. Almost as if they don&#39;t feel they can compete and win, so instead they attempt use their 800 pound gorilla status in some area to force us into doing it their way in others. And often, this blows up in their face, and it may be blowing up in their face big time right now, but we&#39;ll get to that shortly.\u00a0  It&#39;s an indication of an attitudinal shift in Apple I don&#39;t like: it&#39;s one thing to believe it can and should be the dominate player in a market, and when you turn out dominant products like the iPhone, you deserve to be. But increasingly, it seems Apple is shifting from &#34;we can be the biggest player in this market&#34; to &#34;we don&#39;t believe we should have any competitors in this market&#34;. And that trend really worries me and makes me less supportive of Apple in general.\u00a0   The App Store and Apple&#39;s developers  A bit of background seems to be in order. I went to work at Apple to help found a team known as the Direct Response Center. It&#39;s purpose was to act as paid tech support for the &#34;complex&#34; Apple products where &#34;call your dealer&#34; was Apple&#39;s support policy. That included initially Apple&#39;s A/UX Unix product, and later various other things as well. You&#39;ve likely never heard of A/UX, because this was the 68K era of Apple products and possibly before you were born, but that organization grew up, ultimately moved to Austin (without me) and you probably have heard the name of the organization it became, which is Applecare. Over the years, especially after I shifted over to IS&amp;T and became fully involved in building and running email things for Apple, I was involved in many parts of Apple in one way or another.\u00a0  After leaving Apple, I shifted into roles that were various parts of Community Management for outside developers and acting as the Developer Advocate within the company for those outside developers. Two of the companies I did this for were Palm (for the WebOS reboot attempt) and Cisco (when Susie Wee founded their Devnet team, which unlike Palm, has grown and succeeded wildly).\u00a0  At Palm I was involved in the launch of the app store and the developer programs, and I really came to learn and love the challenges of that role. I also really came to believe -- and argue for -- strong support for the independent developers, not just for the big development houses, because I believe that&#39;s where the new developers mature out of that go on to big things, and that&#39;s where the true innovation on a platform happens.\u00a0  Palm was a disaster on many levels and deserved to fail, but the core intentions were good and the plans we tried to implement were worth fighting for. I had always had a belief that the indie developers were vital to any platform, but Palm and working with them on a daily basis and arguing their cases inside the company helped me crystalize that belief -- the indie developer is the lifeblood of an active and innovative development ecosystem, and deserves to be encouraged and nurtured. It may not be an investment that pays off today, but those developers will go on to lead and push forward those bigger teams, and do so as external evangelists for your products and platforms.\u00a0  As part of my work at Palm, I was part of the team that launched that App store, and actually ran the store during beta before we hired the real App Store team, which, of course, included people we hired from Apple.\u00a0   Apple doesn&#39;t value its developers  So when I talk about App Stores and developer programs and how developers should be treated, I point all this out to show that it&#39;s not exactly theoretical for me, it&#39;s personal. I&#39;ve lived that life, fought those wars (and at Palm, more or less lost at every opportunity, but that&#39;s a sad story for another time). And to a degree, it&#39;s why I&#39;ve always hesitated talking about Apple and their developer programs and App Store.\u00a0  Because to me, Apple does an absolute crap job of taking care of their developers. The defining word that comes to mind to me is -- arrogance. An expectation that the developers need Apple, so Apple doesn&#39;t have to reciprocate.\u00a0  And... With the IOS App store, Apple is absolutely correct. Developers need to be on IOS. It&#39;s far less true on MacOS, and if you&#39;ve ever taken a look at the Apple TV App Store, you can easily see how ludicrously poorly that platform is considered by developers.\u00a0  Apple has never been that interested or great at relationships with developers, and I say that with great respect for many members of Apple&#39;s DTS/Devrel teams, some of whom are friends and who have spent years fighting the good fight internally as well.  It&#39;s gotten worse over the years, and while I will cut Apple some slack -- I don&#39;t think people remotely understand the complexity and difficulty of doing things at the scale Apple has to do them -- but where Apple has over the years had opportunities to improve things for developers and make these platforms more appealing, they have consistently chosen to not take those opportunities. There&#39;s zero reason the App Store cut is still 30%, other than Apple believing it can get away with it.\u00a0  I won&#39;t complain about Apple cutting deals with big companies others can&#39;t get -- I&#39;m thinking Amazon&#39;s 15% cut, for one -- because, well, that&#39;s how business operates and honestly, should. But Apple could have shown some love to the smaller devs as well, and didn&#39;t.  Apple has always had a bad track record with indie/smaller developers -- the term &#34;Sherlocked&#34; comes to mind, and that was purely a case of Apple stepping on t\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-20 06:01:09", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "apple,\u5f00\u53d1,\u8feb\u5728\u7709\u776b,arrogance,warning", "title": "Apple\uff0c\u5176\u50b2\u6162\u548c\u6743\u5229\u611f\u77e5\u8ba9\u5b83\u5c06\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u89c6\u4e3a\u9ebb\u70e6\u4e8c\u5341\u5e74\uff0c\u4f1a\u53d1\u73b0\u5f88\u5c11\u6709\u76df\u53cb\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4e89\u53d6\u4e86\u8feb\u5728\u7709\u776b\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1 ", "title_en": "Apple, whose arrogance and sense of entitlement let it treat developers as a hassle for two decades, will find few allies as it fights looming regulation", "transed": 1, "url": "https://mailchi.mp/eb9158dad79e/v3n6-my-life-in-the-apple-ecosystem", "via": "", "real_tags": ["apple", "\u5f00\u53d1", "\u8feb\u5728\u7709\u776b", "arrogance", "warning"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f388e6a282cdc96cfe83dec81b9e973c.jpg", "infoid": 1066946, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff1a\u5b89\u5168\u7814\u7a76\u5458\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4ed4\u7ec6\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u540d\u79f0\u5bfc\u81f4IOS\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5806\u6808\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u7981\u7528iPhone\u8fde\u63a5\u5230Wi-Fi\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\n \u5728Twitter\u4e0a\uff0cCarl Schou\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u540d\u79f0\u52a0\u5165Wi-Fi\u7f51\u7edc\u540e\uff08\u201c\uff05P\uff05S\uff05S\uff05S\uff05N\u201d\uff09\uff0ciPhone\u4e0a\u7684\u6240\u6709Wi-Fi\u529f\u80fd\u90fd\u88ab\u7981\u7528\u4e86\u8be5\u70b9\u3002\n  \u4e00\u65e6iPhone\u6216iPad\u4e0e\u540d\u79f0\u201c\uff05p\uff05s\uff05s\uff05s\uff05n\u201d\u52a0\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u8bbe\u5907\u5c31\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fde\u63a5\u5230Wi-Fi\u7f51\u7edc\u6216\u4f7f\u7528AirDrop\u7b49\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f51\u7edc\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u91cd\u65b0\u542f\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u540e\uff0c\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff08\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u8bf7\u53c2\u9605\u4e0b\u6587\uff09\u3002\n \u867d\u7136Schuo\u6ca1\u8be6\u7ec6\u8be6\u8ff0\u4ed6\u5982\u4f55\u5f04\u660e\u767d\uff0c\u4f46\u4efb\u4f55\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u90fd\u5e94\u8be5\u6ce8\u610f\u89e6\u53d1\u9519\u8bef\u6240\u9700\u7684\u65f6\u9ae6\u7f51\u7edc\u540d\u79f0\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\n \u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff1a\u201c\uff05[\u5b57\u7b26]'\u8bed\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4ee5\u5c06\u53d8\u91cf\u683c\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u8f93\u51fa\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u3002\u5728C\u4e2d\uff0c\u201c\uff05n\u201d\u8bf4\u660e\u7b26\u662f\u6307\u5c06\u5199\u5165\u683c\u5f0f\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5199\u5165\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u5c06\u4f20\u9012\u7ed9\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u683c\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u3002 Wi-Fi\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u5c06\u4e0d\u9648\u8ff0\u7684Wi-Fi\u7f51\u7edc\u540d\u79f0\uff08SSID\uff09\u4f20\u9012\u7ed9\u6267\u884c\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u67d0\u4e9b\u5185\u90e8\u5e93\uff0c\u8fd9\u53c8\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u610f\u5185\u5b58\u5199\u5165\u548c\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u6ea2\u51fa\u3002\u8fd9\u5c06\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u635f\u574f\uff0ciOS\u770b\u95e8\u72d7\u5c06\u6740\u6b7b\u6b64\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7981\u7528\u7528\u6237\u7684Wi-Fi\u3002\n \u663e\u7136\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6666\u6da9\u96be\u4ee5\u7f6e\u7591\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5373\u4efb\u4f55\u4eba\u90fd\u4e0d\u592a\u53ef\u80fd\u610f\u5916\u5730\u843d\u5165\u8fd9\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u9664\u975e\u6709\u4e00\u5806Wi-Fi Pranksters\u7a81\u7136\u7528\u6bd2\u51fa\u7684\u540d\u79f0\u7a81\u7136\u6253\u5f00Wi-Fi\u7f51\u7edc\u7a81\u7136\u5f39\u51fa\u3002\u76f4\u5230Apple\u5728\u672a\u6765\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u4fee\u590d\u4e86\u6b64\u8fb9\u7f18\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u60a8\u7684\u540d\u79f0\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u4f55Wi-Fi\u7f51\u7edc\u7559\u51fa\u4e86\u4efb\u4f55\u7b26\u53f7\u3002\n \u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u4ee5\u67d0\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u4f3c\u4e4e\u4e0d\u4f1a\u635f\u574f\u786c\u4ef6\u3002 \n\u60a8\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u591f\u91cd\u7f6e\u6240\u6709\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u5f00\u59cb\u3002 \u5728\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u8f6c\u5230\u4e00\u822c - \uff06gt;

The issue persists after rebooting the device (although a workaround does exist, see below).\n Although Schuo does not detail exactly how he figured this out, any programmer should notice a pattern in the funky network name required to trigger the bug.\n Here\u2019s the likely explanation: the \u2018%[character]\u2019 syntax is commonly used in programming languages to format variables into an output string. In C, the \u2018%n\u2019 specifier means to save the number of characters written into the format string out to a variable passed to the string format function. The Wi-Fi subsystem probably passes the Wi-Fi network name (SSID) unsanitized to some internal library that is performing string formatting, which in turn causes an arbitrary memory write and buffer overflow. This will lead to memory corruption and the iOS watchdog will kill the process, hence effectively disabling Wi-Fi for the user.\n Obviously, this is such an obscure chain of events that it is highly unlikely that any person accidentally falls into this, unless a load of Wi-Fi pranksters suddenly pop up in the wild with open Wi-Fi networks using the poisoned name. Until Apple fixes this edge case in a future OS update, just keep an eye out for any Wi-Fi networks with percent symbols in their name.\n Nevertheless, If you  are somehow affected by this, the bug does not appear to permanently damage your hardware.\n You should be able to reset all network settings and start over. In Settings, go to General -&gt; Reset -&gt; Reset Network Settings. This resets all saved Wi-Fi networks on the iPhone (as well as other things like cellular settings and VPN access), thereby removing the knowledge of the malicious network name from its memory. You can then join your standard home Wi-Fi once more.\n After joining my personal WiFi with the SSID \u201c%p%s%s%s%s%n\u201d, my iPhone permanently disabled it\u2019s WiFi functionality.

In my use case, I am happy sacrificing e.g. 0.5GB and kill runaway tasks  before the system freezes. Potentially OOM killer would also work better in such conditions. I almost never work at close to full memory capacity, it&#39;s always a single task that goes wrong and brings the system down.\n     No caches means all executable pages, ro pages (e.g. fonts) are evictedfrom memory and have to be constantly reloaded on every user action.\n It is indeed a difficult problem - somecached pages (streaming IO) will likely not be needed again and shouldbe discarded asap, other (like mmapped executable/ro pages of UIutilities) will cause thrashing when evicted under high memory pressure.\n  I would like to try disabling/limiting eviction of some/allfile pages (for example exec pages) akin to disabling swapping, butthere is no such mechanism. Yes, there would likely be problems withlarge RO mmapped files that would need to be addressed, but in manyapplications users would be interested in having such options.\n  Once swap runs out, the kernel stops having a choice. It can only make room by reclaiming important caches. And this will turn bad quickly, as it will eventually include the executables/libraries that must be loaded as they are doing work!\n So, we don&#39;t want to get the kernel into the situation where it must remove executables/libraries from main memory. If that happens, you can end up hitting the disk for  every function call.\n      On this video: running fast memory hogs in a loop on Debian 10 GNOME, 4 GiB MemTotal without swap space.\n prelockd enabled: about 500 MiB mlocked. Starting  while true; do tail /dev/zero; done: no freezes. The OOM killer comes quickly, the system recovers quickly.\n        It&#39;s easy to build a deb package with the latest git snapshot.

It could be used as insulation within   to reduce noise by up to 16 decibels\u2014reducing the 105-decibel roar of a jet   taking off to a sound closer to that of a hair-dryer.\n  The aerogel&#39;s meringue-like structure makes it extremely light, meaning it could act as an insulator within aircraft engine nacelles, with almost no increase in overall weight. The material is currently being further optimised by the research team to offer improved  , offering benefits to fuel efficiency and safety.\n  Researchers from Bath&#39;s Materials and Structures Centre (MAST) have published a method for manufacturing the materials in the journal Nature  Scientific Reports.\n  Professor Michele Meo, who led the research, says: &#34;This is clearly a very exciting material that could be applied in a number of ways\u2014initially in aerospace but potentially in many other fields such as automotive and marine transport, as well as in building and construction.\n   &#34;We managed to produce such an extremely low density by using a liquid combination of graphene oxide and a polymer, which are formed with whipped air bubbles and freeze-casted. On a very basic level, the technique can be compared with whipping   to create meringues\u2014it&#39;s solid but contains a lot of air, so there is no weight or efficiency penalty to achieve big improvements in comfort and noise.&#34;\n  Although the team&#39;s initial focus is in working with partners in aerospace to test the material as a sound insulator in aeroplane engines, they say it could also be used to create panels in helicopters, or car engines. They estimate that the aerogel could be in use within 18 months.

In this paper we analyze the swing ratio (beat-upbeat ratio) implied by the drummer on the ride cymbal. Extending previous work, we propose a new method for semi-automatic swing ratio estimation based on pattern recognition in onset sequences. As a main contribution, we introduce a novel time-swing ratio representation called swingogram, which locally captures information related to the swing ratio over time. Based on this representation, we propose to track the most plausible trajectory of the swing ratio of the ride cymbal pattern over time via dynamic programming. We show how this kind of visualization leads to interesting insights into the peculiarities of jazz musicians improvising together.\n To cite this article:  Christian Dittmar, Martin Pfleiderer, Stefan Balke &amp; Meinard M\u00fcller (2018) A\n      A typical micro-rhythmic trait of jazz performances is their \u2018swing feel.\u2019 According to several studies,\n uneven eighth notes contribute decisively to this perceived quality.

It don\u2019t mean a thing if it\n ... Dittmar et al. address microtiming deviations in jazz [45, 44], and Marchand et al. [107] determine the &#34;level of swing&#34; of diverse genres. These works are concerned with simpler rhythmic patterns-consisting of two eight-notes-and the authors use the autocorrelation computed from an ODF as feature. ...\n ... By looking at the autocorrelation one can obtain information about the relative position of events in a straightforward manner, similarly as it is done by clustering different pattern occurrences as in 3.2.1. The authors of these works propose interesting representations of microtiming deviations such as the swing-ratio [107] or the swingogram  [44], which intend to bring information about the performance other than meter and tempo. This kind of effort in the literature helps closing the gap between what characterizes a musical performance and what automatic-analysis tools can retrieve. ...\n ... 1 Figure 9.1 illustrates an example of microtiming at the sixteenth note level. The interaction between microtiming deviations and other rhythmic dimensions contribute to what has been described as the sense of &#39;swing&#39; or &#39;groove&#39;  [44,107,37]. The systematic use of these deviations is of structural importance in the rhythmic and stylistic configuration of many musical genres. ...\n Computational rhythm analysis deals with extracting and processing meaningful rhythmical information from musical audio. It proves to be a highly complex task, since dealing with real audio recordings requires the ability to handle its acoustic and semantic complexity at multiple levels of representation. Existing methods for rhythmic analysis typically focus on one of those levels, failing to exploit music\u2019s rich structure and compromising the musical consistency of automatic estimations. In this work, we propose novel approaches for leveraging multi-scale information for computational rhythm analysis. Our models account for interrelated dependencies that musical audio naturally conveys, allowing the interplay between different time scales and accounting for music coherence across them. In particular, we conduct a systematic analysis of downbeat tracking systems, leading to convolutional-recurrent architectures that exploit short and long term acoustic modeling; we introduce a skip-chain conditional random field model for downbeat tracking designed to take advantage of music structure information (i.e. music sections repetitions) in a unified framework; and we propose a language model for joint tracking of beats and micro-timing in Afro-Latin American music. Our methods are systematically evaluated on a diverse group of datasets, ranging from Western music to more culturally specific genres, and compared to state-of-the-art systems and simpler variations. The overall results show that our models for downbeat tracking perform on par with the state of the art, while being more musically consistent. Moreover, our model for the joint estimation of beats and microtiming takes further steps towards more interpretable systems. The methods presented here offer novel and more holistic alternatives for computational rhythm analysis, towards a more comprehensive automatic analysis of music.\n ... In some cases, the events in music present small-scale temporal deviations with respect to the underlying regular metrical grid, a phenomenon here referred to as microtiming. The interaction between microtiming deviations and other rhythmic dimensions contribute to what has been described as the sense of &#39;swing&#39; or &#39;groove&#39; [8, 9,30]. The systematic use of these deviations is of structural importance in the rhythmic and stylistic configuration of many musical genres. ...\n ... The systematic use of these deviations is of structural importance in the rhythmic and stylistic configuration of many musical genres. This is the case of jazz  [9,10,20,38], Cuban rumba [2], Brazilian samba [32,39] and Uruguayan candombe [22], among others. Consequently, the analysis of these music genres without considering microtiming leads to a limited understanding of their rhythm. ...\n ... The proposal exploits some simplifications: assuming constant tempo and swing ratio, and propagating beat positions based on the most likely position of the first beat. More recent works perform semi-automatic analysis still relying on informed tempo  [9,10], or using an external algorithm for its estimation [30]. Within the context of candombe and samba, microtiming characterization has also been addressed using either semi-automatic or heuristic methods [17,22,32]. ...\n Events in music frequently exhibit small-scale temporal deviations (microtiming), with respect to the underlying regular metrical grid. In some cases, as in music from the Afro-Latin American tradition, such deviations appear systematically , disclosing their structural importance in rhythmic and stylistic configuration. In this work we explore the idea of automatically and jointly tracking beats and microtiming in timekeeper instruments of Afro-Latin American music, in particular Brazilian samba and Uruguayan candombe. To that end, we propose a language model based on conditional random fields that integrates beat and onset likelihoods as observations. We derive those activations using deep neural networks and evaluate its performance on manually annotated data using a scheme adapted to this task. We assess our approach in controlled conditions suitable for these timekeeper instruments, and study the microtiming profiles&#39; dependency on genre and performer, illustrating promising aspects of this technique towards a more comprehensive understanding of these music traditions.\n ... As one central benefit, computational methods enable corpus-based studies on a large scale. Several studies have been conducted recently for different music genres including pop music [13], jazz [1, 6,9], and Western classical music [2,17,21,24], and also in the field of ethnomusicology [14,16,19]. For conducting such corpus studies, a number of different aspects are important. ...\n ... Beyond its size and composition, the representation of the music data constitutes an important aspect. For example, the data can be given as a symbolic transcription [9,16], as a graphical score [17], or as an audio recording  [6,13,18]. In this paper, we investigate the influence of the music representation type on the corpus analysis results. ...\n ... A major benefit of the WJD lies in its clean annotations of the solo melody (fundamental frequency, F0), which create a controlled environment for systematic experiments. The data served as basis for a number of musicological studies, which mainly focus on performance analysis [1, 6,9]. ...\n For musicological studies on large corpora, the compilation of suitable data constitutes a time-consuming step. In particular, this is true for high-quality symbolic representations that are generated manually in a tedious process. A recent study on Western classical music has shown that musical phenomena such as the evolution of tonal complexity over history can also be analyzed on the basis of audio recordings. As our first contribution, we transfer this corpus analysis method to jazz music using the Weimar Jazz Database, which contains high-level symbolic transcriptions of jazz solos along with the audio recordings. Second, we investigate the influence of the input representation type on the corpus-level observations. In our experiments , all representation types led to qualitatively similar results. We conclude that audio recordings can build a reasonable basis for conducting such type of corpus analysis.\n ... Moreover, music recommender systems could use the data to better rate the danceability and rhythmic similarity between different songs. Going more into musicological research, there is a high interest in determining microrhythmic properties such as swing, shuffle and groove [16]-  [18] inherent in music recordings. Robust ADT in conjunction with precise estimation of onset times (see discussion in Sect. ...\n ... For example, if the desired output is a musical score or tabulature, the time resolution for the detected onsets can be relatively coarse as onset times are quantized based on the smallest increment within a metrical grid (i.e., 16th or 32nd notes), for these kind of representations. For other applications, like analysis of (un-)intentional variation of onset timings by human performers (e.g.,for humanization), musicological studies of micro-timing [16]-  [18], or extraction of a precise symbolic representation (e.g.,MIDI files), a greater precision is required. Perceptionally, the lower bound of the time-gap which allows humans to identify two click sounds as separate is somewhere in the range of 8 -10 ms [90]. ...\n In Western popular music, drums and percussion are an important means to emphasize and shape the rhythm, often defining the musical style. If computers were able to analyze the drum part in recorded music, it would enable a variety of rhythm-related music processing tasks. Especially the detection and classification of drum sound events by computational methods is considered to be an important and challenging research problem in the broader field of Music Information Retrieval. Over the last two decades, several authors have attempted to tackle this problem under the umbrella term Automatic Drum Transcription (ADT). This paper presents a comprehensive review of ADT research, including a thorough discussion of the task-specific challenges, categorization of existing techniques, and evaluation of several state-of-the-art systems. To provide more insights on the practice of ADT systems, we focus on two families of ADT techniques, namely methods based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization and Recurrent Neural Networks. We explain the methods&#39; technical details and drum-specific variations and evaluate these approaches on publicly available datasets with a consistent experimental setup. Finally, the open issues and under-explored areas in ADT research are identified and discussed, providing future directions in this field.\n ... Dynagrams and tempograms, for example, are used to visualize various temporal levels of loudness and tempo variations, respectively.  Dittmar et al. (2018) devised swingogram representations by analyzing and tracking the swing ratio implied by the ride cymbal in jazz swing performance. This visualization enables insights into jazz improvisation such as the interaction between a soloist and the drummer. ...\n A musical performance renders an acoustic realization of a musical score or other representation of a composition. Different performances of the same composition may vary in terms of performance parameters such as timing or dynamics, and these variations may have a major impact on how a listener perceives the music. The analysis of music performance has traditionally been a peripheral topic for the MIR research community, where often a single audio recording is used as representative of a musical work. This paper surveys the field of Music Performance Analysis (MPA) from several perspectives including the measurement of performance parameters, the relation of those parameters to the actions and intentions of a performer or perceptual effects on a listener, and finally the assessment of musical performance. This paper also discusses MPA as it relates to MIR, pointing out opportunities for collaboration and future research in both areas.\n ... Microtiming deviations and their variation across time have been studied in the context of time-keeper instruments (e.g., in Brazilian samba [12], Uruguayan candombe [18], and jazz  [21]). While previous approaches focus on within-instrument rhythmic patterns, we also explore the microtiming generated between time-keepers and nontime-keeper instruments. ...\n Maracatu de baque solto&#34; is a Carnival performance combining music, poetry, and dance, occurring in the Zona da Mata Norte region of Pernambuco (Northeast Brazil). Maracatu percussive music is strongly repetitive, and is played as loud and as fast as possible. Both from an MIR and ethnomusicological perspective this makes a complex musical scene to analyse and interpret. In this paper we focus on the extraction of microtiming profiles towards the longer term goal of understanding how rhythmic performance in Maracatu is used to promote health and well-being. To conduct this analysis we use a set of recordings acquired with contact microphones which minimise the interference between performers. Our analysis reveals that the microtiming profiles differ substantially from those observed in more widely studied South American music. In particular, we highlight the presence of dynamic microtim-ing profiles as well as the importance of the choice of timekeeper instrument, which dictates how the performances can be understood. Throughout this work, we emphasize the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in which MIR, audio engineering, and ethnomusicology must interact to provide meaningful insight about this music.\n A musical performance renders an acoustic realization of a musical score or other representation of a composition.

This paper also discusses MPA as it relates to MIR, pointing out opportunities for collaboration and future research in both areas.\n The advent of affordable digital sampling technology brought about great changes in music production. Experienced producers of sample-based electronic music (SBEM) are capable of understanding the intricate relationship between a sampled source and its use in a new track, harnessing its properties to shape the structure, timbre, and rhythm of their compositions. However, automated analysis of the phenomena surrounding both SBEM and the sources it uses for its samples is a challenge which involves many tasks from music information retrieval (MIR) and audio processing. In this thesis we develop models and techniques to better understand SBEM at different levels. In particular, we offer four main technical contributions to retrieval and analysis tasks. First, we explore how timbral changes affect the spectral peak maps used in audio fingerprinting as a means to identify overlapping samples. Second, we analyze the structure of typical SBEM tracks using audio decomposition based on non-negative matrix factor deconvolution (NMFD). Third, we investigate the interaction of timbre and structure by designing a mid-level audio feature based on cascaded harmonic-residual-percussive source separation (CHRP). Fourth, we apply random forests to identify the quintessential sampling source: drum breaks. Given their prominent role in SBEM, we devote considerable attention to drum breaks. As an application to computational musicology, we formalize an algorithm for calculating local swing ratio in drum breaks and adapt an autocorrelation-based method to analyze their microrhythmic properties. Finally, we present a creative application to music production which allows combining the temporal and timbral properties of two separate drum breaks (redrumming). Despite the massive commercial success of SBEM and the practice of sampling, they mostly remain outside the attention of formal academic studies and MIR research. In this thesis our overarching goal is to identify and formalize some of the fundamental audio processing tasks related to SBEM, proposing methods that can seed further research.\n Music constitutes a challenging multimedia scenario. Besides music recordings, there exist a number of other media objects including symbolic music representations, video recordings, scanned sheet music, or textual metadata.

", "note_en": "On May 17, the City Council of Mesa, Arizona, approved the  $800 million development of an enormous data center -- a warehouse filled with computers storing all of the photos, documents and other information we store \u201cin the cloud\u201d -- on an arid plot of land in the eastern part of the city.\n But keeping the rows of powerful computers inside the data center from overheating will require up to 1.25 million gallons of water each day, a price that Vice Mayor Jenn Duff believes is too high.\u201cThis has been the driest 12 months in 126 years,\u201d she said, citing data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \u201cWe are on red alert, and I think data centers are an irresponsible use of our water.\u201d\n   Duff was the only Mesa City Council member to vote against  the development. But she\u2019s one of a growing number of people nationwide raising concerns about the proliferation of data centers,  which guzzle electricity and water while creating relatively few jobs, particularly in drought-stricken parts of the United States.\n  The spike in use of data-intensive cloud services such as video conferencing tools, video streaming sites like Netflix and YouTube and online gaming, particularly as people quarantined during the pandemic, has increased demand for the computing power offered by data centers globally. And this means more data centers are being built every day by some of America\u2019s largest technology companies, including Amazon, Microsoft and Google and used by millions of customers.  According to the Synergy Research Group, there were about 600 \u201chyperscale\u201d data centers, massive operations designed and operated by a single company that then rents access to cloud services, globally by the end of 2020. That\u2019s double the number there were in 2015. Almost 40 percent of them are in the United States, and  Amazon, Google and Microsoft account for more than half of the total.\n The U.S. also has at least 1,800 \u201ccolocation\u201d data centers, warehouses filled with a variety of smaller companies\u2019 server hardware that share the same cooling system, electricity and security, according to  Data Center Map. They are typically smaller than hyperscale data centers but,  research has shown, more resource intensive as they maintain a variety of computer systems operating at different levels of efficiency.\n Many data center operators are drawn to water-starved regions in the West, in part due to the availability of solar and wind energy. Researchers at Virginia Tech estimate that one-fifth of data centers draw water from moderately to highly stressed watersheds, mostly in the Western United States, according to a  paper published in April.\n  Typically, where data centers are located is based on proximity to customers and infrastructure, the cost of land, the tax incentives offered by local governments and access to low-cost electricity, the researchers said.\n \u201cI am not sure the degree to which environmental considerations are in the decision-making process,\u201d said Landon Marston, lead author of the paper.\n All centers need some form of cooling technology, typically either computer room air-conditioning systems -- essentially large units that cool air with water or refrigerant -- or evaporative cooling, which evaporates water to cool the air. Evaporative cooling uses a lot less electricity, but more water. Since water is cheaper than electricity, data centers tend to opt for the more water-intensive approach.\n The growth in the industry shows no signs of slowing. The research company Gartner predicts that spending on global data center infrastructure will reach $200 billion this year, an increase of 6 percent from 2020, followed by 3-4 percent annually over the next three years. This growth comes at a time of record temperatures and drought in the United States,  particularly in the West.\n  \u201cThe typical data center uses about 3-5 million gallons of water per day -- the same amount of water as a city of 30,000-50,000 people,\u201d said Venkatesh Uddameri, professor and director of the Water Resources Center at Texas Tech University.\n  Although these data centers have become  much more energy and water efficient over the last decade, and don\u2019t use as much water as other industries such as agriculture, this level of water use can still create potential competition with local communities over the water supply in areas where water is scarce, he added.\n But some tech companies like Google say they are trying to address their water use.\n \u201cAs part of our water stewardship efforts, we\u2019re working to utilize water more efficiently and exploring ways to incorporate circularity,\u201d said Gary Demasi, senior director of energy and location operations at Google. \u201cWe have a site-specific approach where we work within the constraints of the local hydrological environment to find the best solutions.\u201d\n He added that \u201cmany arid environments provide an abundant supply of carbon-free solar and wind energy,\u201d which explains why data centers are drawn to those areas.\n  Sergio Loureiro, vice president of core operations for Microsoft, said that the company  has pledged to be \u201cwater positive\u201d by 2030, which means it plans to replenish more water than it consumes globally. This includes reducing the company\u2019s water use and investing in community replenishment and conservation projects near where it builds facilities.\n    In recent years,  tensions over water use by data centers have flared in communities across the United States. In 2017, conservation groups in South Carolina  criticized Google over its request for a permit to draw 1.5 millions of gallons of water per day from a depleted aquifer to cool its expanding data center in Goose Creek. The facility already required 4 million gallons of tap water each day, and residents and conservation groups were concerned about the company\u2019s  impact on the dwindling groundwater supply. After a two-year battle with the South Carolina Coastal Conservation league over the plans, Google reached an agreement to use only groundwater under limited conditions, for example, during maintenance work or as a backup during drier months, and instead pay for an alternative source of surface water from the Charleston Water System.\n  Google spokeswoman Mara Harris said that the company partnered with local community stakeholders and water conservation experts to assess the data center\u2019s impact and conducted studies that showed that even in an \u201cextreme worst-case scenario\u201d the data center\u2019s water use in the area would be sustainable.\n Both companies and consumers need to start treating water conservation as seriously as reducing carbon emissions, experts say.\n   \u201cWe are going to experience a drier and more water-scare future, and every drop of water counts,\u201d said Newsha Ajami, director of urban water policy at Stanford\u2019s Woods Institute for the Environment. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Amazon, Microsoft and Google causing these water footprints. But it\u2019s you and me, searching and needing data that ends up in these data centers.\u201d\n Ajami said that water has been historically undervalued as a resource in part because it has been cheap for companies to purchase. While many industries have taken great leaps in reducing their electricity use and carbon footprints, they lag behind in water efficiency throughout their supply chains, she said.\n  \u201cWe often overlook the communities impacted, who are often disadvantaged,\u201d she added. \u201cIf it was a wealthy community, maybe they wouldn\u2019t allow the data centers to be built in their backyard.\u201d\n   Water conservation experts say that a key challenge has been the lack of alignment between cities\u2019 economic development plans and their resource conservation efforts. Often the promise of attracting a household-name technology company to build a billion-dollar data center that will bring jobs and investment to the region will override concerns over the water supply.\n  \u201cCities don\u2019t want to tell tech companies that they can\u2019t come to their city because of lack of water,\u201d said Cora Kammeyer, a senior researcher with the Pacific Institute, a nonprofit research organization that focuses on water conservation.\n   \u201cWhen it comes to economic development, I don\u2019t think we are fully transparent about the water concerns,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to keep the image that we are a great place to invest and start a business. But we don\u2019t like to talk about the water.\u201d The Mesa project approved on May 17, which was submitted under the name of a developer called Redale LLC, has been shrouded in secrecy. The name of the company that will run the data center has only been supplied to the city under a nondisclosure agreement, although one Mesa city source, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deal and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said it was Facebook. The specialist news site  Data Center Dynamics also reported that it was likely to be Facebook based on similarities in the planning specifications to its other data centers. Facebook declined to comment, and Redale did not respond to a request for comment. The proposed data center will employ an estimated 150 people across three buildings and pay the city millions of dollars in sales tax on the construction and utilities.\n Duff added that even though data centers don\u2019t use as much water as other industries, they are \u201cstill depleting water in the desert, and that is a concern.\u201d\n She noted that this is the \u201ceighth or ninth\u201d data center project in Mesa. The city previously approved a Google facility, currently under construction, that will consume up to 4 million gallons of water per day,  as reported by Bloomberg. The Redale project represents a significant milestone to Mesa\u2019s water supply as it\u2019s the first where the city required the developer to obtain water credits from the Salt River Project to use groundwater in the event that the city can\u2019t meet the data center\u2019s demand for water.\n \u201cIt\u2019s the only way we could say we had enough water for the business,\u201d Duff said.\n  Surface water supplies that Arizona uses from Lake Mead, America\u2019s largest reservoir, and the Colorado River that feeds it, have already  dwindled to their lowest levels ever, according to the Bureau of Reclamation, a federal water management agency. The water level is so low that federal restrictions are likely to be triggered on Arizona\u2019s water allocation from the reservoir, which could happen at the start of 2022. S ix other states in the West could also face such restrictions.\n As that happens, Duff said, more companies will start to draw on their \u201cwater credits\u201d to use groundwater supplies. However,  according to research by Arizona State University, these water credits are over allocated, meaning that if everybody started using them at the same time, there wouldn\u2019t be enough water to go around.\n \u201cWe are very resourceful, but I think we need to wake up,\u201d Duff said. \u201cThe analysis shows our safeguards aren\u2019t there and we need to come up with a concrete plan instead of a hope and a prayer.\u201d\n   To the south of Mesa, the city of Chandler, Arizona, has taken a different approach. In 2015 the city passed an ordinance that restricted new water-intensive businesses from developing unless they aligned with the city\u2019s plan for economic development. It effectively deters businesses that use a lot of water but don\u2019t create many jobs, including data centers, in favor of those that create thousands of jobs,  such as semiconductor plants.\n  The city\u2019s water resource manager, Gregg Capps, said the ordinance, the first of its kind in the U.S., was introduced as a direct result of discovering in 2013 how much water one of the data centers in the city was using after the company started requesting additional water connections. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know a whole lot about them back then, but that brought our attention to their water use,\u201d he said.\n His team took their concerns to the City Council, which spent months developing the ordinance. Since it was adopted in 2015, there have been no new data center developments in Chandler.\n \u201cWater is a strategic resource. It\u2019s important to us,\u201d Capps said.\n   The Silicon Valley technology companies that dominate the hyperscale data center market -- Amazon, Google and Microsoft -- are conscious of the business and reputational risk associated with data centers\u2019 thirst. All of them have made some progress in reducing their data centers\u2019 water footprint through innovative cooling strategies. These include free-air cooling, which uses fresh outdoor air to cool a space, and immersion cooling, where servers are submerged in a liquid that boils at a lower temperature than water, taking the heat with it. However, free-air cooling only really works in cooler climates, and immersion was just used  for the first time in a commercial setting by Microsoft in April.\n  Some companies,  including Microsoft have developed underwater or partially submerged data centers that rely on large bodies of already cool water to disperse heat.\n Google\u2019s Demasi said that the company cooled its data centers using seawater in Finland, industrial canal water in Belgium and recycled wastewater in the United States, at its site in Douglas County, Georgia.\n  Switching over to new technologies can be extremely costly, and data center operators are more likely to wait until the end of the lifecycle of the existing equipment than retrofit cooling systems, said Todd Boucher, founder of the data center design firm Leading Edge Design Group.\n   In Mesa, Duff is thinking about the legacy of the decisions her city, and others, are making about water now. \u201cI am 61 years old, and I know that in whatever lifetime I have left I will not see the total impact of what we are doing today,\u201d she said. \u201cBut our children and their children will, and we have to take responsibility for that.\u201d\u201cI hope the next generation does not look back at ours and say, \u2018What were you thinking?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d like to think we saw the warnings and started taking aggressive measures in order to preserve our planet and our lives.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-20 03:59:19", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

", "note_en": "Babis Anagnostopoulos had claimed robbers killed Caroline Crouch, 20, who was found dead next to her baby\n    Greeks have been left reeling after the husband of a British-born student confessed and was charged with her murder, a crime he had previously blamed on a robbery.\n In a dramatic twist to a case that has gripped the country since Caroline Crouch was strangled next to her baby daughter, investigators announced late on Thursday that Babis Anagnostopoulos had admitted to the murder.\n  \u201cThe culprit is her 33-year-old husband who has confessed to the act,\u201d the Greek police tweeted.\n Anagnostopoulos, who appeared in court on Friday handcuffed and wearing a bulletproof vest, was charged with intentional homicide and abuse of an animal, after the family dog was also found killed. Crouch, who had met the man she would go on to marry as a teenager on the Greek island of Alonissos where her parents have long lived, was 20.\n Initially the helicopter pilot had blamed his wife\u2019s death on ruthless \u201cforeign\u201d robbers who had broken into the couple\u2019s suburban Athens home, a version of events he had maintained for more than five weeks. He claimed he had been blindfolded and tied to a bed, drifting in and out of consciousness as he watched the crime unfold.\n \u201cEverything was staged for the crime scene to look like the scene of a robbery,\u201d Costas Hassiotis, the director of the greater Athens homicide division, told reporters, adding that the suspect had tied his own hands and those of his dead wife.\n Speaking outside court, Vassilis Spyrou, Anagnostopoulos\u2019s lawyer, confirmed that his client had confessed to the crime, adding that he had expressed remorse for his actions.\n \u201cHe\u2019s in a very bad psychological state,\u201d Spyrou had earlier told Alpha TV. \u201cHe knows what he has done, he has admitted to the crime.\u201d\n Nikos Rigas, the deputy chairman of the police officers\u2019 association of Athens, told state TV that examination of mobile devices, a smartwatch, and cameras had established a timeline that revealed inconsistencies in the pilot\u2019s account.\n \u201c(The suspect) tried to create a crime scene environment that looked convincing: the dog was killed, and his baby was placed next to the body of the murdered mother,\u201d Rigas said.\n Anagnostopoulos, who was in Alonissos attending a memorial service for Crouch at which he was photographed hugging the victim\u2019s mother, was arrested after being flown to the Greek capital on a police helicopter on Thursday. When police initially picked him up he was told a suspect had been identified, but not that it was him.\n It was not the first time he had been called to the police headquarters to give testimony. But this time the police had evidence \u2013 in the form of data gleaned from Caroline\u2019s smartwatch and the pilot\u2019s mobile phone \u2013 that Anagnostopoulos had killed his wife. A pulse monitor on the watch showed she was dead at a time before he claimed the raid had taken place, while a fitness app on his phone proved he was moving around the house at the time he said he had been blindfolded and tied up.\n In both cases, the findings conflicted with the timeline of events the professional pilot had previously given. A memory card removed at 1.20am from the security camera of the couple\u2019s home, several hours before 4.30am when he claimed the thieves had broken in, provided further evidence.\n Presented with the new data, Anagnostopoulos admitted to the murder, telling the detectives their relationship had grown increasingly stormy and he had killed Crouch in a fit of rage after she had threatened to leave him, police said.\n \u201cI had to appear persuasive and so I strangled the dog too,\u201d he was reported as saying in extracts of testimony released by police to the Greek media.\n  Few crimes in living memory have outraged Greeks so deeply and for 37 days the pilot had appeared distraught, telling police he had \u201cbegged for their lives\u201d as the thieves pointed a pistol at Lydia, his daughter\u2019s temple, and telling the press he hoped no family had to experience the same ordeal. \u201cThey were so happy, so in love,\u201d Alonissos\u2019 mayor Petros Vafinis told the Guardian at the time. \u201cThe shock in our little community is immense.\u201d\n  Athens\u2019 citizens protection minister, Michalis Chrysohoidis, said within hours of the 11 May murder being made public: \u201cWe rarely encounter such brutality in Greece, both in Greek society and in crime.\u201d\n In a rare step, the government declared a \u20ac300,000 reward for information that might lead to the capture of the culprits.\n Images of Anagnostopoulos attending his wife\u2019s funeral cradling their 11-month-old baby resonated far and wide.\n So, too, did his heartrending eulogy given by Caroline\u2019s graveside. \u201cI am lucky that I met you, very lucky that you loved me and even more lucky that you are the mother of my child,\u201d he had said. \u201cLydia will grow up not remembering her wonderful mother, but Caroline who was the joy of life will always be near me, through Lydia.\u201d\n His confession was quick to elicit rage. Overnight Greeks flooded social media with messages of condemnation and calls for justice, while the mainstream media expressed shock not only at the hypocrisy of \u201cthis accomplished actor\u201d but the willingness of so many, including senior Greek justice officials, to go along with his story that hardened \u201cAlbanian and Georgian\u201d criminals were to blame for the murder.\n \u201cThe pandemic of sympathy for the professional, respected father who, tied up, saw his young wife being murdered in front of his child has collapsed like a tower of cards,\u201d the leftwing newspaper Efsyn wrote in an editorial. \u201cAlong with it the far-right propaganda about foreign thieves committing heinous crimes has collapsed too.\u201d\n On Friday, the case was being likened to that of Oscar Pistorius, the South African sprinter who was convicted in 2015 of fatally shooting his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, in his Pretoria home.\n \u201cWe have experienced the Greek version of the Pistorius case, it has almost the same characteristics,\u201d Giorgos Kalliakmanis, who heads the union of police employees in west Attica told state-run TV.\n From the outset, he said, investigators had suspected the pilot but were flummoxed by the lack of DNA, or other evidence, that pointed to his culpability.\n \u201cThe Pistorius crime shocked people across the world. And this crime has caused ripples beyond the Greek borders,\u201d he said, adding that investigators had followed a \u201cstep-by-step\u201d approach to ensure they would obtain the proof that would allow them to ensnare the perpetrator.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 03:53:12", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u624b\u673a,\u667a\u80fd,lies,\u544a\u8bc9", "title": "\u5982\u4f55\u7531\u4ed6\u7684\u624b\u673a\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u8868\u66b4\u9732\u51f6\u624b\u7684\u8c0e\u8a00 ", "title_en": "How a Murderer's Lies Were Exposed by His Cellphone and a Smartwatch", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/17/greek-husband-confesses-to-of-british-woman", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u624b\u673a", "\u667a\u80fd", "lies", "\u544a\u8bc9"]}]
