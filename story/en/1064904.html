By far my favorite memory was going to an open source conference and meeting  Aaron Patterson (aka Tenderlove). Aaron is a legend: a member of the Rails core team and an incredibly fascinating person (just take a look at  his website and you’ll understand why). I had never seen someone fix bugs as quickly as him or have such deep knowledge of knowledge of Linux, Rails, and Ruby.</p><p>  在我的初级麻省理工学院，我在开源软件上课程。到目前为止，我最喜欢的记忆将参加一个开源会议并遇见Aaron Patterson（又名临床）。亚伦是一个传奇：铁路核心团队的成员和一个令人难以置信的迷人的人（只是看看他的网站，你会明白为什么）。我从未见过有人像他一样快速地修复虫子，或者对Linux，Rails和Ruby的知识深度了解。</p><p>  After I   met Aaron, I knew I wanted to be just as good as him at programming. So I started contributing to Rails and fixing as many small bugs as I could find. For the next 6 months, I spent my extra hours before class (and during my least favorite classes) working on Rails bug reports. By sheer luck, my first taste of professional software development happened to be on one of the most influential and widely used web frameworks. The core team members held every pull request to a very high standard, and I learned a lot about how to write good code.</p><p>  在我遇到亚伦之后，我知道我想在编程时和他一样好。所以我开始为Rails提供贡献，并在我找到的情况下修复了许多小错误。在接下来的6个月里，我在课堂上（以及在我最不喜欢的课程期间）在Rails错误报告上花费了额外的小时。通过纯粹的运气，我的第一次味道的专业软件开发恰好是最具影响力和广泛使用的Web框架之一。核心团队成员将每个拉出请求持有非常高的标准，我学到了很多关于如何编写好的代码的很多。</p><p> Lesson: You have to get lucky, but you also have to capitalize on the lucky opportunities.</p><p> 课程：你必须幸运，但你也必须利用幸运的机会。 </p><p> Over the summer, I got assigned to my first big project. I was asked to complete a major refactor of the structure of the Rails application. Unfortunately,  my patch ran into many issues and never made it into Rails. I learned that making big changes in heavily used code usually leads to bad outcomes (especially when you don’t fully understand a system).</p><p>在夏天，我被分配到了我的第一个大项目。我被要求完成轨道应用结构的主要重构。不幸的是，我的补丁遇到了许多问题，从来没有把它变成铁轨。我得知大量使用的代码中的大变化通常会导致不良结果（特别是当您不完全理解系统时）。</p><p> However, I persisted and kept making smaller patches. As the summer came to a close, I had climbed up to become one of the top 50 Rails contributors (to this day,  I’m still in the top 100). But my commits started petering out as the school year started and I began looking for jobs.</p><p> 但是，我坚持并保持较小的补丁。随着夏天来到近距离结束，我爬上了升起成为前50个轨道贡献者之一（到这一天，我仍然在前100名）。但是我的犯罪开始在学年开始时，我开始寻找工作。</p><p>  Lesson: It’s ok to miss out on your top choice. Your optimization function might be different in a couple of years.</p><p>  课程：错过您的最佳选择是可以的。您的优化功能在几年内可能不同。</p><p> As I started job hunting, one company stood out amongst all the others:  Meteor. I was incredibly excited about Meteor’s team and product. They were a team of ex-Asana engineers building a new open source web framework that automatically pushed database changes out to the frontend. Meteor combined my love of open source software with the new exciting technologies of the time. The only problem was that I didn’t get the job.</p><p> 当我开始求职时，一家公司在所有其他公司中脱颖而出：流星。我对Meteor的团队和产品感到非常兴奋。他们是一支ex-asana工程师团队，构建一个新的开源Web框架，自动将数据库变为前端推出。流星将我对开源软件的热爱与新的令人兴奋的技术。唯一的问题是我没有得到这份工作。</p><p> I was devastated at the time, but looking back, this ended up being a good thing. I was lucky enough to get job offers from a range of small to large companies. I decided to accept an offer from a little known company called Stripe.</p><p> 我当时被摧毁，但回头看，这最终是一件好事。我很幸运能够从一系列小公司那里获得工作。我决定接受来自一家名为STRIPE的小公司的报价。</p><p> At the time, Stripe wasn’t an obvious choice. My parents had never heard of it, nor had any of my friends (and it would be years before any of my friends had any idea what Stripe did). It was hard to square Stripe’s salary with the money and stability offered at larger tech companies. When I tried to negotiate, I was given the party line: “all engineering salaries are the same.” And I still wanted to work on open source software (ya, I was pretty bummed about Meteor).</p><p> 当时，条纹不是一个明显的选择。我的父母从来没有听说过它，也没有任何朋友（并且在任何朋友之前都有几年是多年的想法，我有任何想法。在较大的技术公司提供的金钱和稳定性，难以平方的薪水。当我试图谈判时，我给了派对线：“所有工程薪水都是一样的。”而且我仍然想在开源软件上工作（你，我非常讨厌流星）。</p><p> I loved the excitement of Silicon Valley and wanted to be a part of it, so I was determined to find a company where I could be a sponge. There were a lot of companies doing exciting things, from big data companies started by world renowned professors to companies producing the next cutting edge frontend web framework. Every startup seemed to be growing. But it became apparent that external factors were lagging indicators of great companies.</p><p> 我喜欢硅谷的兴奋，并希望成为其中的一部分，所以我决定找到一家我可以成为海绵的公司。从世界知名教授从世界知名教授始于生产下一个尖端前端Web框架的公司开始，有很多公司。每次启动似乎都在增长。但是，显而易见的是，外部因素是伟大公司的滞后指标。 </p><p> Lesson: It’s hard to spot great businesses, but if you can spot great people to work with, you can narrow the window.</p><p>课程：很难发现伟大的企业，但如果你能够发现伟大的人才合作，你可以缩小窗户。</p><p> Stripe was ever so slightly different because it had intelligent people doing things with humility and care. Everyone I talked to genuinely cared about their job and about me as a person, and everyone was high powered. I remember being in awe of  Nelson Elhage and  Evan Broder who worked on technology to hot-swap a linux kernel without rebooting. They were always excited to talk about problems and how to solve them.</p><p> 条纹略有不同，因为它有聪明的人用谦卑和关怀做事。每个人都谈到真正关心他们的工作和我作为一个人，每个人都很高。我记得在尼尔逊elhage和Evan Broder敬畏，他们在技术上工作了解了Linux内核而不重新启动。他们总是兴奋地谈论问题以及如何解决它们。</p><p> I also remember the care Stripe put into the recruiting process.  Patrick Collison went on a coffee walk with me, chatting about everything from Stripe’s machinations to acquire a defunct bank to the economic drivers of productivity growth. They introduced me, a random college student, to their investors. I was in awe and quite literally shaking when they had  Michael Moritz and  Paul Graham do 20 minute chats with me.</p><p> 我还记得护理条纹投入招聘过程。 Patrick Collison与我一起享用咖啡吧，聊天从Stripe的加工中聊天，以获得积极的银行到生产力增长的经济驱动因素。他们介绍了我，一个随机大学生到他们的投资者。当他们有Michael Moritz和Paul Graham做20分钟的聊天时，我敬畏了。</p><p> In the end, it was the thoughtfulness and drive in Stripe’s culture that set it apart. Many companies had one or the other, but very few had both.</p><p> 最终，这是条纹文化中的思想和驱动器，使其分开。许多公司都有一个或另一个公司，但很少有两者。</p><p>  So there I was, ready to start working at Stripe in the summer, when Max Kolysh (now the CEO of  Dover) sat me down for lunch at Chipotle. It was November of my senior year in college and I was excited to spend my last semester learning and not having to care about grades.</p><p>  所以在那里，我准备在夏天开始在夏天开始工作，当Max Kolysh（现在的多佛首席执行官）坐在Chipotle的午餐时。这是我高级大学的11月，我很高兴能够花费我上一个学期的学习，而不是要关心等级。</p><p> I listened intently to Max talk about how he and  Doug Feigelson had gotten into YC to build an API to connect online shopping. I thought the idea was a bit ridiculous, but Max and Doug were incredibly smart, driven, and humble people. I’ve always optimized my environment for learning and being around great people, so next thing I knew I was signing incorporation documents and flying out to Mountain View. I had no idea what I’d do about the Stripe offer come summer, but I would figure it out when the time came.</p><p> 我专注地听取了最大谈论他和道格·费格尔顿如何进入YC来建立一个连接在线购物的API。我以为这个想法有点荒谬，但最大和道格是令人难以置信的聪明，驱动和谦卑的人。我一直在优化我的环境，以学习和存在于伟大的人身边，所以我知道我知道我正在签署合并文件并飞出山景。我不知道夏天我对条纹的报价做了什么，但是当时候弄清楚了它。</p><p>  I packed up a duffel bag of clothes and headed out to Palo Alto to start  Zinc. During this time, I learned to grind. Each morning, we’d wake up around noon and code until 8pm. We’d eat a quick dinner and go to the gym before returning at 11pm to continue coding until 3 or 4am in the morning. Many people would say we worked too hard, but I loved it. We were doing something exciting and I poured my heart and soul into it.</p><p>  我打了一袋衣服，然后前往帕洛阿尔托开始锌。在这段时间里，我学会了磨砺。每天早晨，我们都会在中午醒来，代码直到晚上8点。我们会吃快餐晚餐，然后去健身房前，然后早11点返回，继续编码，直到早上3点到4点。很多人会说我们努力工作，但我喜欢它。我们正在做点什么令人兴奋的事情，我把内心和灵魂倒入其中。 </p><p>  However, as YC came to an end, we still hadn’t come up with a real product. We had been instilled with the YC mentality that growth is paramount and we did everything we could to achieve growth. This led us to create a consumer app that lost money on every transaction. YC was a great forcing function for us to focus exclusively on growth, but we didn’t spend enough time figuring out the fundamentals of what we were doing. What’s more, I learned that coding 13 hours a day doesn’t guarantee anything.</p><p>然而，正如YC结束的那样，我们仍然没有提出真正的产品。我们已经灌输了的YC心态，即生长至关重要，我们尽我们所能实现增长。这使我们在每次交易上创建一个消费者应用程序。 YC是我们专注于增长的巨大强迫功能，但我们没有花费足够的时间来弄清楚我们在做什么的基础。更重要的是，我了解到每天13个小时编码并不能保证任何东西。</p><p> These were hard lessons that I’d carry into the future. As we shut down our product, I knew my startup experience was coming to an end. I had already accepted Stripe’s offer and I was going to stay true to my word. So in June of 2014, I had a somber meeting with Max and Doug and went to work for Stripe.</p><p> 这是我携带未来的艰苦课程。当我们关闭我们的产品时，我知道我的启动体验即将结束。我已经接受了Stripe的报价，我将保持忠实于我的话。所以在2014年6月，我有一个忧郁的会议，最大和道格，并去了条纹。</p><p>  When I started at Stripe, I asked to delay my start date until after a family vacation, but my manager just told me to start sooner and take time off later (Stripe was just shy of 100 employees and moving incredibly quickly). I now had an artificial deadline of one month to ship my first project.</p><p>  当我开始条纹时，我要求延迟我的开始日期，直到家庭度假，但我的经理告诉我迟早开始，以后休息时间（条纹只是害羞100名员工，并令人难以置信地移动）。我现在有一个月的人为截止日期来发货我的第一个项目。</p><p> I was assigned to improve email receipts with  Michelle Bu. We spent the month touching different parts of the Stripe infrastructure and writing a ton of code. Just before launch date, we stayed up the entire night fixing polish items. I remember going to sleep in a phone booth and waking up early in the morning to try to finish out some last edits while Michelle worked on the blog post.</p><p> 我被分配到改善与米歇尔州的电子邮件收据。我们花了这个月抚摸条纹基础设施的不同部分，并编写了一吨代码。就在发布日期之前，我们留在整个夜晚固定波兰物品。我记得要睡在一个电话亭里，早上醒来，试图完成最后一个编辑，而米歇尔在博客帖子上工作。</p><p> Lesson: Great engineers aren’t defined by years of experience. They need to care deeply about the product and have the technical prowess to build a great experience.</p><p> 课程：伟大的工程师不受多年的经验。他们需要深入关心产品，并有技术实力建立一个伟大的体验。</p><p>  One of the things that struck me at Stripe was how humble and hardworking people were. Even though Michelle was a veteran of the Stripe codebase, pushed forward a ton of the project, and even wrote the blog post for the launch, she put my name on the final result (amazingly, this post is still up on  Stripe’s blog). I thought that said a lot about her and Stripe in general.</p><p>  一个在条纹上击中我的事情是人们的谦逊和勤劳。尽管Michelle是Stripe CodeBase的退伍军人，但推动了一大吨项目，甚至为发射的博客文章写了一下，她把我的名字放在最终结果上（令人惊讶的是，这篇文章仍然在条纹的博客上。我以为这对她和条纹一般说了很多。</p><p> Michelle also taught me that there are different flavors of great engineers. Some great engineers can act like oracles because of their knowledge and experience. Michelle was only one year out of college, but still one of Stripe’s best engineers (in an unsung hero kind of way). She kept standards high, fixed bugs when she saw them, talked to customers to understand problems, and shipped a ton of changes.</p><p> 米歇尔也教会了我，有不同的伟大工程风味。一些伟大的工程师可以像他们的知识和经验一样表现得像oracles。米歇尔只有一年大学，但仍然是条纹的最好的工程师之一（以一种无名英雄的方式）。当她看到它们时，她保持高度固定的错误，谈到客户了解问题，并发布了一大吨的变化。 </p><p>  Stripe was doing incredibly well and was on track to be a very special company. It had an electric atmosphere that combined ambition and humility. But after a year and a half, I started longing for something different. Many of my friends were shocked by my decision to work at Stripe, and many were equally shocked when I quit Stripe to return to Zinc. However, I wanted to optimize for learning and I believed I would learn a broader set of skills at a smaller company.</p><p>条纹令人难以置信，是一个非常特别的公司。它具有雄心壮志和谦卑的电气氛围。但经过一年半，我开始渴望不同的东西。我的许多朋友被我在条纹上班的决定震惊，当我戒掉条纹返回锌时，许多人同样震惊。但是，我想优化学习，我相信我会在较小的公司学习更广泛的技能。</p><p> Zinc began to find traction among a very specific niche of users. Before  Plaid pioneered a similar business model for finance, our team built out a set of APIs to e-commerce websites for a clientele of small businesses selling items on Amazon and eBay. Within a couple of years, we had built a very profitable business making millions of dollars per year with only about $400k in pre-seed funding. We followed the lead of Basecamp who espoused the benefits of work-life balance, small teams, and eschewing venture capital.</p><p> 锌开始在用户的非常具体的利基中找到牵引力。在格子PIONEERED之前，我们的团队为销售了亚马逊和eBay上的物品的小企业的电子商务网站为电子商务网站建立了一系列API。在几年内，我们建立了一个非常有利可图的业务，每年赚到数百万美元，只有约400万美元的比赛资金。我们遵循Basecamp的领导，他们支持工作生活平衡，小团队和挖掘风险投资的好处。</p><p>  I loved being at Zinc because the feedback loop was extremely fast. We could see how our decisions a couple of months ago affected our current day to day. For example, building our backend in NodeJS with callbacks haunted us for years. Every time we wrote code, we would contribute more cruft to a sprawling callback hierarchy. On the other hand, our investment in our DevOps infrastructure allowed us to cheaply scale thousands of servers across many cloud hosting providers. Every cent we saved in server costs led directly to a dollar in profit.</p><p>  我喜欢在锌中，因为反馈回路非常快。我们可以看到几个月前的决策如何影响我们当前的日常日。例如，在NodeJS中建立我们的后端，随着回调困扰我们多年。每次我们写代码时，我们都会为庞大的回调层次结构提供更多的cruft。另一方面，我们对Devops基础架构的投资使我们可以在许多云托管提供商中廉价地扩展数千个服务器。我们在服务器成本中保存的每一分钱都直接达到了美元的利润。</p><p>  After a few years, we were in great shape at Zinc. However, I itched to throw myself at even bigger problems and started talking to my brother,  Ryan Wang, and my old friend,  Brian Sze. They were leading a team that built internal tools for the support team at Stripe.</p><p>  几年后，我们在锌的形状很大。然而，我抛食了自己甚至更大的问题，并开始与我哥哥，王王和我的老朋友说话，Brian Sze。他们领导着一个团队，为条纹的支持团队建立了内部工具。</p><p> Stripe had seen triple digit growth for years, but still cared about a great support experience. Patrick Collison used to invite engineers over to his apartment to help answer support tickets. However, this didn’t scale as volume grew and Stripe increasingly had to rely on a set of outdated tools to manage its support team. We saw that many companies had very similar problems as Stripe and that the support ecosystem was lacking good tools.</p><p> 条纹已经看到了多年来的三位数增长，但仍然关心伟大的支持体验。 Patrick Collison曾经邀请工程师到他的公寓，以帮助回答支持门票。但是，由于卷生长和条纹越来越多地依赖于一组过时的工具来管理其支持团队的规模并没有扩展。我们看到许多公司都有非常相似的问题，并且支持生态系统缺乏良好的工具。</p><p> I vividly remember our first meeting with GoFundMe’s support team when  Morgan Wood showed us a Google Sheet containing thousands of rows, a litany of color-coordinated cells, and multiple people trying to make edits. While we were at their office, someone had made an accidental edit on the spreadsheet and the operations lead,  Jordan Philyaw, had to manually recreate the entire sheet. The level of wizardry was amazing, but it was clear that the tooling needed to get better.</p><p> 我生动地记得我们的第一次会面与Gofundme的支持团队在摩根木头向我们展示了一个包含数千行的Google纸张，一连串的颜色协调的细胞，以及多个人试图做出编辑。虽然我们在他们的办公室时，有人在电子表格上进行了意外编辑，并且运营铅，乔丹·北部，不得不手动重新创建整个纸张。巫术水平很棒，但很明显，该工具需要更好。</p><p> Seeing these types of struggles across the industry led Brian, Ryan, and I to start  Assembled to transform and elevate customer support. We recently  raised a $16M Series-A and I’m now applying many of the lessons I’ve learned to creating a long-lasting, impactful company:</p><p> 看到这些类型的斗争遍布了整个行业LED Brian，Ryan，以及我开始组装以改造和提升客户支持。我们最近筹集了1600万美元的系列，我现在正在申请我学会了许多课程，以创造一个持久的有影响力的公司： </p><p>  Figure out what great looks like. For the first couple of years of Assembled, we didn’t have a clue about how to market ourselves. So we talked to a few dozen experts who showed us what the best of the business did. This made it really easy for us to determine what we needed. We interviewed quite a few marketers with amazing resumes, but when we met  Megha Narayan, we knew immediately she was someone who had the skills and temperament to overhaul our marketing organization. All the pre-work we did allowed us to quickly identify Megha’s talent and switch to sell mode much sooner than we would have. Luckily, Megha joined us and is now building the future of marketing at Assembled.</p><p>弄清楚伟大的样子。对于组装的最初几年来，我们没有关于如何销售自己的线索。所以我们谈到了几十个专家，他们向我们展示了最好的业务。这使我们真的很容易确定我们需要什么。我们采访了一些具有惊人的营销人员，但是当我们遇到Megha Narayan时，我们立即了解她是一个拥有促进我们的营销组织的技能和气质的人。我们确实的所有前工作都允许我们快速识别Megha的才能，而且可以比我们所拥有的更快销售模式。幸运的是，Megha加入了我们，现在正在建立营销的未来。</p><p> You have to get lucky, but you also have to capitalize on the lucky opportunities. When we started Assembled, we had little product and even fewer customers. When we were introduced to  Casper by a potential investor, our point of contact  Amanda Kwasniewicz mentioned that she would be in San Francisco. We invited her over to our (nonexistent) office and she miraculously agreed to come see a demo. We scrambled to find a temporary office space and worked nonstop to address all of the product issues we foresaw. Luckily, Amanda took a bet on us and we eventually were able to build something valuable for Casper.</p><p> 你必须幸运，但你也必须利用幸运的机会。当我们开始组装时，我们的产品甚至更少的客户。当我们被潜在的投资者介绍到Casper时，我们的联系点Amanda Kwasniewicz提到她将在旧金山。我们邀请她到（不存在）办公室，她奇迹般地同意来看看演示。我们争先恐后地查找临时办公空间，并努力解决我们前容的所有产品问题。幸运的是，阿曼达对我们进行了赌注，我们最终能够建立一个对卡斯珀有价值的东西。</p><p> Great engineers aren’t defined by years of experience. Great engineers need to care deeply about the product and have the technical prowess to build a great experience. My Stripe experience taught me that 10x engineers exist and that they have a special combination of skills. For Assembled, it’s not sufficient for our engineers to simply meet the technical hiring bar. We’re looking for people who can change the course of our company with a combination of technical skills, user centric-ness, great communication, and practical mindedness. Looking for these attributes has helped us build a  world class product team that’s been able to scale a multi-million dollar business with just 5 engineers.</p><p> 伟大的工程师不受多年的经验。伟大的工程师需要深入关心产品，并有技术实力建立一个伟大的体验。我的条纹经验教会了我的工程师，并且他们具有特殊的技能组合。对于组装，我们的工程师简单地符合技术招聘吧是不够的。我们正在寻找能够通过技术技能，用户中心，沟通和实践思想的组合改变公司课程的人。寻找这些属性帮助我们构建了一个世界级产品团队，该团队能够只能扩展多百万美元的公司，只需5名工程师。</p><p> Looking back, I’ve had many ebbs and flows along my journey, but I wouldn’t trade the lows for anything. I’ve learned the most from the worst times and they’ve helped concentrate my focus. I’m forever grateful for all of the amazing people I’ve met and the people who have taken bets on me.</p><p> 回顾一下，我沿着我的旅程有很多枯萎并流动，但我不会为任何东西交换低点。我从最糟糕的时间学到了最大的地方，他们帮助专注于我的重点。我永远感激我遇到的所有令人惊叹的人以及那些对我赌注的人。</p><p>  P.S.
