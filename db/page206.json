Initially, Spora Health is taking a telemedicine approach but eventually plans to open physical locations.\n  Spora Health patients get access to its care delivery platform and care team that consists of doctors, nurse practitioners, nutritionists and more. Its machine learning-driven technology also can predict risk profiles for patients and look for chronic conditions like pre-diabetes, hypertension, emphysema and more.\n  Spora Health costs $9.99 per month. On the first visit, patients pay their normal co-pay. For those without insurance, they pay a one-time $99 fee on their first visit. You can think of it almost as a One Medical, which charges $199 per year, but with the specific needs of Black people and people of color in mind.\n \u201cBeing a young startup, we can compete on price,\u201d Miller said. \u201cFor us, we can make the offering more affordable because we have less overhead as well as tech that allows us to be more thoughtful.\u201d\n While the goal is to better serve Black people and people of color, not all of Spora Health\u2019s providers fall into those demographics.\n \u201cWe want to overindex on providers of color but supply and demand doesn\u2019t match up,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThere\u2019s a shortage of providers of color becoming physicians. So we need to invest in the reeducation of providers.\u201d\n In order to become a provider on Spora Health, medical professionals must go through an interview process and participate in the Spora Institute. The Spora Institute serves to reeducate providers and help them understand their implicit biases.\n \u201cWithin med school, there is a curriculum around health equity but that only happens in the first year of the program,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWhat tends to happen by the end of residency is that a lot of these implicit biases tend to surface again because the training curriculum and environment does not incorporate equity and doesn\u2019t think about disparities in certain populations.\u201d\n Spora Health is actively raising a $1.2 million seed round. So far, the company has closed $1 million of that round.", "posttime": "2020-11-10 01:10:35", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "health,people,spora", "title":

"note_en": "Up to seven of these new \u201cMy Mix\u201d playlists will be featured on the Home tab, the company says, and will include a combination of favorite tunes as well as potential new favorites for discovery purposes.\n With the launch, YouTube is also rebranding its personalized playlist previously called \u201cYour Mix.\u201d To better clarify its purpose and eliminate possible confusion with the new \u201cMy Mix\u201d playlists, this playlist will now be called \u201cMy Supermix,\u201d and will combine all of a user\u2019s music tastes into one playlist, like Spotify\u2019s \u201cDiscover Weekly.\u201d\n  YouTube is making other changes to its Home tab and personalized selections, too, it says.\n  Now, the Home tab will feature an activity bar offering easy access to four activity types, including Workout, Focus, Relax, and Commute. These will take the user to a dedicated personalized homepage with a variety of playlists suited to the activity in question. The Workout tab, in particular, has been updated to include up to four new personalized mixes that feature music you already like as well as new recommendations. These tabs will also include a \u201cSupermix\u201d of the different playlists.\n Personalization has become a key battleground for music streaming services, which aim to use technology to better cater to users by creating unique mixes and delivering more targeted recommendations. YouTube and Apple have both mimicked Spotify\u2019s features on this front, offering their own variations on personalized playlists like Spotify\u2019s flagship playlist, \u201cDiscover Weekly,\u201d and others.\n YouTube  Music,   though, has not had as much success in gaining a following, perhaps due to  Google\u2019s   confusing and overlapping music strategy over the past several years, where it offered two different music apps.\n Google has finally begun to correct his, and has  started the transition that will shift users off its older service, Google Play Music, and over to YouTube Music. The latter, to date, has  struggled with gaining a sizable share in the competitive music market, where Spotify and Apple  dominate.\n According to a MIDiA report in June, Google is in fifth place with a 6% share, behind Spotify, Apple, Amazon, and Tencent. However, the report suggested that YouTube Music\u2019s appeal to a younger demographic could help Google turn things around, as its share had grown from just 3% in Q1 2018 to Q1 2019.", "posttime": "2020-11-10 01:10:22", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "youtube,\u590d\u5236,copies,\u97f3\u4e50", "title": "\nYouTube\u590d\u5236Spotify\u7684\u201cDaily Mikes\u201d\u548c\u5176\u65b0\u7684\u201cMy Mix\u201d\u529f\u80fd", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tYouTube copies Spotify\u2019s \u2018Daily Mixes\u2019 with its new \u2018My Mix\u2019 feature\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/youtube-copies-spotifys-daily-mixes-with-its-new-my-mix-feature/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["youtube", "\u590d\u5236", "copies", "\u97f3\u4e50"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "4330e5ba5abdf72aa24b414c212ba409.jpg", "infoid": 1034083, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u7ed9\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u597d\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u672c\u7f51\u7ad9\u4f7f\u7528Cookie\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u7ee7\u7eed\u6d4f\u89c8\u7684\u8bdd\u3002\u60a8\u63a5\u53d7\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528Cookie\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u67e5\u770b\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u6709\u5173\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u7684Cookie\u7684\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\n\u00d7\u60f3\u8981\u638c\u63e1\u79d1\u6280\u9886\u57df\u6b63\u5728\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u4e00\u5207\u7684\u8109\u640f\u5417\uff1f\u6ce8\u518c\u8ba2\u9605\u5927\u536b\u00b7\u76ae\u5c14\u65af\u7684\u6bcf\u65e5\u65f6\u4e8b\u901a\u8baf\u3002\n\u6211\u8fd8\u60f3\u6536\u5230\u5173\u4e8e\u91cd\u5927\u7a81\u53d1\u65b0\u95fb\u548c\u7279\u522b\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u793c\u4eea\u8b66\u62a5\u3002\n\u00d7\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u79d1\u6280\u884c\u4e1a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u52a8\u5411\u5417\uff1f\u6bcf\u5468\u4e94\u8ba2\u9605Shakeel Hashim\u7684\u65f6\u4e8b\u901a\u8baf\u3002\n\u6211\u8fd8\u60f3\u6536\u5230\u5173\u4e8e\u91cd\u5927\u7a81\u53d1\u65b0\u95fb\u548c\u7279\u522b\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u793c\u4eea\u8b66\u62a5\u3002\n\u00d7\u60a8\u662f\u5426\u8ddf\u4e0a\u4e86\u4e91\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u53d1\u5c55\uff1f\u6bcf\u5468\u4e09\u8ba2\u9605\u6c64\u59c6\u00b7\u514b\u62c9\u9f50\u7279\u7684\u65f6\u4e8b\u901a\u8baf\u3002\n\u6211\u8fd8\u60f3\u6536\u5230\u5173\u4e8e\u91cd\u5927\u7a81\u53d1\u65b0\u95fb\u548c\u7279\u522b\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u793c\u4eea\u8b66\u62a5\u3002\n\u00d7\u4f60\u77e5\u9053\u98ce\u9669\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u521b\u4e1a\u4e16\u754c\u6b63\u5728\u53d1\u751f\u4ec0\u4e48\u5417\uff1f\u6bcf\u5468\u516d\u8ba2\u9605\u6bd4\u5179\u00b7\u5361\u68ee\u7684\u65f6\u4e8b\u901a\u8baf\u3002\n\u6211\u8fd8\u60f3\u6536\u5230\u5173\u4e8e\u91cd\u5927\u7a81\u53d1\u65b0\u95fb\u548c\u7279\u522b\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u793c\u4eea\u8b66\u62a5\u3002\n\u00d7\u4f60\u77e5\u9053\u79d1\u6280\u548c\u5a31\u4e50\u754c\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u4f1a\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u5417\uff1f\u6bcf\u5468\u56db\u8ba2\u9605\u626c\u79d1\u00b7\u7f57\u7279\u683c\u65af(Janko Roettgers)\u65f6\u4e8b\u901a\u8baf\u3002\n\u6211\u8fd8\u60f3\u6536\u5230\u5173\u4e8e\u91cd\u5927\u7a81\u53d1\u65b0\u95fb\u548c\u7279\u522b\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u793c\u4eea\u8b66\u62a5\u3002\n\u00d7\u60f3\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4e86\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ef7\u503c1500\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u884c\u4e1a\u5417\uff1f\u6bcf\u5468\u4e8c\u8ba2\u9605\u8d5b\u65af\u00b7\u5e0c\u585e\u5c14\u548c\u6c99\u57fa\u5c14\u00b7\u54c8\u5e0c\u59c6\u7684\u65f6\u4e8b\u901a\u8baf\u3002\n\u6211\u8fd8\u60f3\u6536\u5230\u5173\u4e8e\u91cd\u5927\u7a81\u53d1\u65b0\u95fb\u548c\u7279\u522b\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u793c\u4eea\u8b66\u62a5\u3002", "note_en": "x                                                              To give you the best possible experience, this site uses cookies.

"note_en": "Recently, I came across a resource that allowed me to download the entire collection of UTZOO NetNews Archive of the earliest USENET posts. These were essentially the earliest available discussions posted to the Internet by people working at various Universities who were already connected to the Internet. There were approximately 2.1 million posts in these archives created between Feb 1981 and June of 1991. This article describes the journey of converting those tapes into fully searchable PostgreSQL database and later also into the  usenetarchives.com website.\n   Until 2001, these early Usenet discussions were considered being lost, but miraculously  Henry Spencer from the University of Toronto, Department of Zoology was backing it up onto magnetic tapes and kept them stored for all these years (apparently at a great cost).\n H. Spencer had altogether 141 of these magnetic tapes, but there were of no use, so eventually, him and a couple of motivated people such as David Wiseman (who dragged 141 tapes back and forth in his a pickup truck), Lance Bailey, Bruce Jones, Bob Webber, Brewster Kahle, and Sue Thielen; embarked on a process of converting all of these tapes into the regular format, accessible to everyone.\n  Well, not so fast, once I unzipped the data, I realized that the TGZ format contains literally millions of small text files (each post in its own file). While it was certainly nice to have, it wasn\u2019t something that I or anyone else could read. Certainly not in a forum like discussion format. It wasn\u2019t obvious which post is the one that starts the discussion or which ones are the replies to the thread. And forget about searching through these files, that was utterly not possible. Just to put things into perspective, it took me over 5 hours to un-tar the archives.\n That said, it didn\u2019t take long for me to decide to develop a Python-based converter that would allow me to convert the entire collection from millions of flat files into a fully searchable PostgreSQL database. The following post talks about the process and also includes the Python code of the solution released as open source.\n     Once downloaded you\u2019ll see that archive contains 161 x TAR Archive files. It looks like this:\n  So, I grabbed a copy of the 7-Zip archiver from  https://www.7-zip.org and started decompressing the files.\n I ended up with over  2,104,828\u00a0flat text files in  56,988 folders, which was the entire copy of Henry Spencer\u2019s Usenet archive.\n For those who like numbers, here is each Utzoo tape along with its size, number of files and folders:\n   While examining the extract, I realized that Magnetic Tape 118 is uncompressed in \\utzoo-wiseman-usenet-archive\\news118f1 folder, named tape118, so I had rename it to tape118.tar and extracted it manually, only to realize it\u2019s a copy of files which I already have. Someone creating the original archive forgotten to remove that file. There are 3 files in these folders that need to have.tar extension added and decompressed as well:\n  If you opened one of the folders and navigated down to one of the many subfolders, you\u2019d find a file that contained the message. For example, going into\u00a0\\utzoo-wiseman-usenet-archive\\news006f1\\b15\\net\\aviation folder, I was now apparently in the  net.aviation Usenet group. But the only way to find out was to open one of the files and look at the content. Here I highlighted what it looked like.\u00a0As you can see, each file seems to consist of a header, then a single empty line and the body of the message:\n    So, I decided to build a Python parser, that went through all these files reading the header portion of each message and grouping all unique results together, giving me all the possible headers such as (From, Subject, Newsgroup, etc.). I found that there were about 79 x different types of headers. So it appeared that not all messages adhered to the same basic structure. Going through the headers, all had the standard set that was common across all posts.\n Once I had the common field, I\u2019ve created a Postgres database called \u2018utzoo\u2019\n    The above database and schema were the pre-requisites. Everything else, like table creation, inserting the posts, etc. is part of the Python script and fully automated.\n In terms of table creation, the script automatically creates 5 tables for each detected newsgroup:\n   create table all_messages. GroupName_headers( id bigserial not null constraint GroupName_headers_pk primary key, dateparsed timestamp, subj_id bigint, ref smallint, msg_id text, msg_from bigint, enc text, contype text, processed timestamp default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);alter table all_messages.GroupName_headers owner to postgres;create table all_messages. GroupName_refs( id bigint, ref_msg text default null);alter table all_messages.GroupName_refs owner to postgres;create table all_messages. GroupName_body( id bigint primary key, data text default null);alter table all_messages.GroupName_body owner to postgres;create table all_messages. GroupName_from( id serial not null constraint GroupName_from_pk primary key, data text);alter table all_messages.GroupName_from owner to postgres;create table all_messages. GroupName_subjects( id serial not null constraint GroupName_subjects_pk primary key, subject text);alter table all_messages.GroupName_subjects owner to postgres;\n Those will be the tables where the Python parser will dump all the data and make sure posts are properly lined up between tables.\n The python script also creates indexes to make the inserting and later reading of the posts faster:\n create unique index GroupName_headers_uiidx on all_messages.GroupName_headers(id);create unique index GroupName_headers_umidx on all_messages.GroupName_headers(msg_id);create unique index GroupName_body_idx on all_messages.GroupName_body(id);; create unique index GroupName_from_idx on all_messages.GroupName_from(data);create unique index GroupName_subjects_idx on all_messages.GroupName_subjects(subject);\n   The following screenshot explains how it\u2019s all wired up. I didn\u2019t do any hardcoded relationships, but you can change the script if you want that.\n    The date is an integral part of each message and I had to do some data conversion massaging in Python to get the proper date, as dates were coming in a variety of formats. I\u2019ve tried various libraries but dateutil.parser.parse standard date and time library for Python did the best job.\n However, I still needed to account for various labelling of data fields in the headers, so if data wasn\u2019t found in the \u2018date\u2019 header, I had to look into other header parts such as \u2018NNTP-Posting-Date\u2019, \u2018X-Article-Creation-Date\u2019,\u00a0\u2018Posted\u2019,\u00a0or \u2018Received\u2019 fields.\n   Well and then it was all about creating a Python parser, start the PostgreSQL, point it to an archive directory, and wait :)\n At the bottom of this article is the code of the Python solution. It\u2019s about 1,000 lines, and it took altogether about 1 day to create and test it. The script is smart enough to keep the track of where it started, so if it needs to be interrupted, it\u2019ll know where to continue from to get the job done.\n      The final solution artifact is called \u2018 utzoo2postgres.py\u2018 , and it was tested on Python 3.8.\n          Note: In case you need to stop the program and run it later, the script is smart to resume from the last spot it was processing.\n   The script will process all Utzoo Archive messages in about 6 hours (depending on the speed of your machine).\n   Here is a screenshot of the database after only a couple of minutes of conversion:\n  As you can see, the conversion utility produces a database with 5 tables per group where messages are linked to each other through auto-created indexes.\n Let\u2019s say we want to look up all discussions in the  net.physics discussions; and sort them out by the number of replies.\n   Now, we can look up a particular discussion by the ID. For example, we want the ID: 1648 from the screenshot above, the discussion with the subject: \u201c Question on FTL and quantum mechanics\u201c. That\u2019s not so hard either:\n    It\u2019s nice to have a database full of posts, but it\u2019s hardly usable that way. I needed something that would allow me to easily access these posts.\n So, once everything was done, I built a PHP script around this code and registered  https://usenetarchives.com to make all these archives available online, in an easy to read and search (forum-like) web site.\n The PHP code is not part of this article, but you can head over to   https://usenetarchives.com/groups.php?c=utzoo to see how it all works:\n    So now that it\u2019s all done, I have to say, it was a great journey.\n For those who want to play with the code, you can grab it from  Github and adjust it to your liking. Please don\u2019t judge the code, it\u2019s not pretty, nor formatted or commented out (for the most part) as I wasn\u2019t exactly planning to release it. I did so primarily for posterity reasons. But now that it\u2019s out there you\u2019re more than welcome to fork the repo, clean it up though and commit your changes, so others can benefit from your work too.\n  To conclude this article, this is the illustrated process of getting information from each of the files into the PostgreSQL database.\n  7.

behind podcasts such as &#34;Dirty John,&#34; &#34;Dr. Death,&#34; &#34;American History Tellers,&#34; and &#34;Business Wars,&#34; wants between $300 million and $400 million, the sources said.\n At the higher end of the range, any deal would be the industry&#39;s biggest deal yet. In July, satellite radio company SiriusXM bought podcast company Stitcher for $325 million.\n At least four companies have held talks with Wondery, Bloomberg reported, and a deal is expected in coming months.\n   Spotify \u2014which has spent big money on podcast talent and is reportedly considering a  podcast-only subscription plan \u2014 decided not to bid, two sources told the publication.\n Wondery did not immediately respond to Business Insider&#39;s request for comment. Business Insider has also approached Apple and Sony for comment.\n  Wondery is behind more than 100 current podcasts including, and is developing more than a dozen TV shows based on its podcasts, including one for Apple about WeWork.\n   In October, more than 8 million unique listeners in the US streamed or downloaded Wondery&#39;s podcasts a total of 58 million times, according to data from  Podtrac. This places it as the sixth-biggest podcast publisher in the US, and the largest independent podcast publisher in the world.\n  Apple has ramped up its podcasting services in recent years, buying Pop Up Archive in 2017 and Scout FM earlier in 2020 \u2014 but buying\u00a0Wondery would mark a renewed commitment to podcasting, which as a medium doesn&#39;t generate much money.\n As a while, podcasting generates $1 billion a year in ad sales in the US, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau, per Bloomberg.\n  By clicking \u2018Sign up\u2019, you agree to receive marketing emails from Business Insider as well as other partner offers and accept our  Terms of Service and  Privacy Policy.\n          Two crossed lines that form an &#39;X&#39;.

"note_en": "Remember  PT? The free &#34;playable trailer&#34; was  released for the PS4 back in 2014 to promote a Hideo Kojima and Guillermo del Toro-led  Silent Hill sequel featuring Norman Reedus. But when  that project was cancelled in 2015, the demo was removed from the PlayStation Store, even as a redownload.\n That means the short horror demo is now only playable on some of  the 1 million or so PS4 systems that downloaded it before the discontinuation. Those units  have sold for heavily inflated prices on eBay as the hard-to-access demo has  achieved cult classic status among horror game fans.\n In the lead-up to the PS5&#39;s launch this week, there was  some speculation that those trapped demos could be freed from their PS4 prisons via transfer to a backward-compatible PS5. Now, though,  multiple  outlets have  confirmed that the game can&#39;t be moved from a PS4 to a PS5; When you try through the system&#39;s App Transfer menu, you simply get a message saying, &#34;You can&#39;t use this PS4 game or app on the PS5.&#34;\n What makes this story even stranger is the fact that  PT apparently  was transferable to and fully playable on the PS5 earlier in the prerelease period.  Polygon reports that the game transferred and played just fine on the PS5 as of October 24, and  GamesRadar reported the same as of October 27. In the days since, though, that situation changed to block both transfer and play on the PS5. Even copies previously transferred are reportedly listed as &#34;Playable on PS4&#34; when viewed on the PS5&#39;s Library menu.\n In a sense, this isn&#39;t a surprise. For years now, Konami has worked to cut off access to  PT, and the company had  already confirmed that the game wouldn&#39;t be downloadable on the PS5. Still, the fact that  PT was briefly playable on prerelease PS5 units shows that Konami and Sony had to make an affirmative decision to limit the game&#39;s availability on the newer system.\n It seems that  PT will join  only a small handful of other PS4 games that are not playable on PS5. And PlayStation games that predate the PS4  aren&#39;t playable on the PS5 except as available through PlayStation Now streaming.\n For now, if you missed out on your chance to download  PT years ago, your best bet might be recreations  designed for the PC or  in the PS4 game-making tool  Dreams.", "posttime": "2020-11-10 00:25:02", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot",

"note_en": "One of the more interesting additions from this new group \u2014 at least from a technology perspective \u2014 is the new editorial playlist, \u201cViral Hits.\u201d While Apple doesn\u2019t specifically mention  TikTok   by name here, the short-form video app\u2019s influence is apparent.\n TikTok\u2019s music-laden memes and trends today heavily influence what younger users are listening to. The app has also long-since proven its ability to break new artists and send tracks, both new and  old, up to the top of the streaming charts across Spotify and Apple Music, as well as the Billboard charts, at times.\n  With the \u201cViral Hits\u201d playlist, Apple will round-up the songs that are making the leap from social media channels to \u201cthe broader cultural stream,\u201d the company explains.\n \u201cSocial media hasn\u2019t just changed how we communicate, but also what we listen to and how we hear it,\u201d says Apple.\n  Because of the nature of viral trends, there\u2019s no set schedule as to when the \u201cViral Hits\u201d playlist will update. Instead, Apple Music editors will updated the selections throughout the week, as needed.\n Currently, there are 98 songs representing nearly 5 hours of music on the playlist, including many tracks that are also now on Apple Music\u2019s top charts. But the tracks on \u201cViral Hits\u201d aren\u2019t ranked by number of plays they\u2019re receiving \u2014 it\u2019s an editorial selection, not a chart.\n Apple isn\u2019t alone in formally acknowledging the power TikTok has over popular music. Spotify last week launched a new feature for artists that would allow them  to promote tracks that were going viral on TikTok.\n  In addition to \u201cViral Hits,\u201d the other new Apple Music playlists aimed at a Gen Z demographic include the following additions:\n Superbloom: Apple describes this playlist as a \u201cnew home for young, risk-taking visionaries who think about music differently.\u201d The selections will feature artists who often have developed grass-roots followings across social media, where they\u2019ve experimented and sparked trends.\n Lifted: This cross-genre playlist is a melting pot of music Apple describes as \u201ca little underground, but too dynamic for the mainstream to ignore.\u201d Tracks will range from the poppy end of the spectrum to hip-hop, R&amp;B, and indie rock, Apple says.\n Wildflower: This playlist will feature emerging voices across a mix of hip-hop, R&amp;B, dance, indie pop and rock.\n  The Nerve: This playlist features \u201cdowncast hybrids\u201d of hip-hop, pop punk, emo, and grunge that are \u201ca little too raw for broader audiences.\u201d Apple says the music can be \u201cbleak.\u201d\n  Verified Hits: Another cross-genre playlist, this one featuring hit songs from genres including pop, indie, arty R&amp;B, and electronic.\n Catching Feelings: Music for chilling that\u2019s a little slow moody, mellow and low-key.\n Do Not Disturb: Music on this playlist aims to help listeners not feel alone when dealing with mental health issues, like the ups, downs, crashes and the coping, says Apple.\n Apple says the new playlists were created specifically with the needs of Gen Z users in mind, describing this young group as \u201ctech savvy, social media mavens\u201d as well as \u201crabid music lovers.\u201d\n In addition to the Gen Z playlists, Apple Music released 24 brand-new playlists aimed at helping users center and find a few moments of calm. These playlists follow what has been a tense week in the U.S., particularly, due to the 2020 Presidential Elections and their delayed results.", "posttime": "2020-11-10 00:19:45", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "apple,\u5e26\u6709,music,\u97f3\u4e50", "title": "\nApple Music\u9488\u5bf9Z\u4e16\u4ee3\u589e\u52a0\u4e8610\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u64ad\u653e\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5217\u8868\u5e26\u6709TikTok\u70b9\u51fb\u91cf", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tApple Music adds 10 new playlists aimed at Gen Z, including one with TikTok hits\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/apple-music-adds-10-new-playlists-aimed-at-gen-z-including-one-with-tiktok-hits/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["apple", "\u5e26\u6709", "music", "\u97f3\u4e50"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e46ff3fe6e87c4cee2b1bc34690ce778.jpg", "infoid": 1034072, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u4e00\u6b21\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u4f1a\u8bae\u4e0a\uff0c\u9ea6\u5f53\u52b3\u5ba3\u5e03\uff0c\u5b83\u5df2\u7ecf\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u72ec\u5bb6\u5f00\u53d1\u9ea6\u5f53\u52b3\u914d\u65b9\u3002\u300a\u4eca\u65e5\u7f8e\u56fd\u300b(USA Today)\u63f4\u5f15\u9ea6\u5f53\u52b3\u56fd\u9645\u603b\u88c1\u4f0a\u6069\u00b7\u535a\u767b(Ian Borden)\u5728\u4e00\u6b21\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u4f1a\u8bae\u4e0a\u7684\u8bdd\u8bf4\uff0c\u9ea6\u5f53\u52b3\u662f\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3a\u9ea6\u5f53\u52b3\u91cf\u8eab\u5b9a\u505a\u7684\u3002\n\u636eBorden\u79f0\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u914d\u65b9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5ef6\u4f38\u5230\u4ee5\u690d\u7269\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6c49\u5821\u3001\u9e21\u8089\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\u548c\u65e9\u9910\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\u3002\n\u5230\u76ee\u524d\u4e3a\u6b62\uff0c\u9ea6\u5f53\u52b3\u5728\u690d\u7269\u6027\u6c49\u5821\u548c\u9e21\u8089\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e89\u593a\u6218\u4e2d\u4e00\u76f4\u5904\u4e8e\u843d\u540e\u5730\u4f4d--\u81f3\u5c11\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u3002\n\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5730\u7684\u9ea6\u5f53\u52b3-\u5305\u62ec\u5fb7\u56fd\u3001\u82f1\u56fd\u3001\u9999\u6e2f\u3001\u4ee5\u8272\u5217\u3001\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u548c\u82ac\u5170\u7684\u5206\u5e97-\u91d1\u8272\u62f1\u95e8\u4e0b\u7684\u98df\u5ba2\u53ef\u4ee5\u627e\u5230\u7d20\u98df\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\u9009\u62e9\u3002\n\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0a\uff0c\u9ea6\u5f53\u52b3\u53bb\u5e74\u5728\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86Beyond Meat for the PLT\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\u7684\u8bd5\u70b9(\u6211\u731c\u8fd9\u662f\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4e4b\u524d\u63a8\u51fa\u7684\u4e09\u660e\u6cbbMcDLT\u7684\u7ffb\u7248)\u3002\n\u4e0e\u7f8e\u56fd\u5176\u4ed6\u4e00\u4e9b\u5feb\u9910\u8fde\u9501\u5e97\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u9ea6\u5f53\u52b3\u6709\u4e9b\u843d\u540e\u3002\u6c49\u5821\u738b\u4e0eImpact Foods\u5408\u4f5c\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86Impact Whop per\uff0cBeyond Meat\u4e0e\u80af\u5fb7\u57fa(KFC)\u5408\u4f5c\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u6b3e\u690d\u7269\u6027\u91d1\u5757\u3002\n\u5230\u76ee\u524d\u4e3a\u6b62\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u5bb6\u9886\u5148\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5236\u9020\u5546\u5728\u74dc\u5206\u5feb\u9910\u5e02\u573a\u65b9\u9762\u505a\u5f97\u76f8\u5f53\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u4f46\u9ea6\u5f53\u52b3\u4ee5\u5176\u72ec\u5bb6\u914d\u65b9\u8fdb\u5165\u5feb\u9910\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e24\u5bb6\u516c\u53f8(\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u5e0c\u671b\u4ece\u9ea6\u5f53\u52b3\u98df\u54c1\u5e1d\u56fd\u4e2d\u5206\u4e00\u676f\u7fb9\u7684\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8)\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u80af\u5b9a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6253\u51fb\u3002\n\u8fd9\u5305\u62ec\u667a\u5229\u7684The Not Company\u548c\u9999\u6e2f\u7684Green\u661f\u671f\u4e00\u63a7\u80a1\u516c\u53f8\u7b49\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u5bb6\u516c\u53f8\u90fd\u5728\u4e89\u593a\u9ea6\u5f53\u52b3\u7684\u690d\u7269\u6027\u8089\u997c\u4e1a\u52a1\u3002", "note_en": "In an investor meeting McDonald\u2019s announced that it had worked to develop its McPlant formulation exclusively. \u201cMcPlant is crafted exclusively for McDonald\u2019s, by McDonald\u2019s,\u201d Ian Borden, McDonald\u2019s international president, said at an investor meeting, quoted by USA Today.\n The company\u2019s special formulation could extend across plant-based products including burgers, chicken-substitutes and breakfast sandwiches, according to Borden.\n  To date, McDonald\u2019s has been a laggard in the corporate fight over plant-based burgers and chicken \u2014 at least in the U.S.\n In McDonald\u2019s around the world \u2014 including locations in Germany, the UK, Hong Kong, Israel,  Canada,   and Finland \u2014 diners under the golden arches can find a vegetarian sandwich option.\n Indeed, in Canada, McDonald\u2019s launched a pilot last year with  Beyond Meat   for the PLT sandwich (a play off of the company\u2019s previous sandwich the McDLT, I\u2019m assuming).\n Compared to some other fast food chains in the US, McDonald\u2019s has been something of a laggard.  Burger King   has worked with Impossible Foods to launch the Impossible Whopper and Beyond Meat has partnered with  KFC   on a plant-based nugget.\n The two leading alternative protein makers have done a fairly good job of carving up the fast food market to date \u2014 but McDonald\u2019s entry with its exclusive formulation must come as a blow to the companies (and the other startups that were hoping for a bite of McDonald\u2019s food empire).\n That includes startups like Chile\u2019s the Not Company and Hong Kong\u2019s Green Monday Holdings, which have both been vying for McDonald\u2019s

personal loan to support the site.\n Quartz was founded in 2012 by Atlantic Media, then acquired by Uzabase (a Japanese financial data and media company) for $86 million in 2018.\n The company has struggled to make the business side work in recent years, reporting a loss of $18.4 million on revenue of $26.4 million in 2019, and cutting about 80 staff positions earlier this year.\n In  an

"note_en": "Cast your mind back earlier this year at the height of the pandemic lockdown, which forced millions to work from home and rely on Zoom for work meetings and remote learning.\u00a0At the time, Zoom claimed video calls were protected by \u201cend-to-end\u201d encryption, a way of scrambling calls that makes it near-impossible for anyone \u2014 even Zoom \u2014 to listen in.\n   \u201cIn reality, the FTC alleges, Zoom maintained the cryptographic keys that could allow Zoom to access the content of its customers\u2019 meetings, and secured its Zoom Meetings, in part, with a lower level of encryption than promised,\u201d said the FTC  in a statement Monday. \u201cZoom\u2019s misleading claims gave users a false sense of security, according to the FTC\u2019s complaint, especially for those who used the company\u2019s platform to discuss sensitive topics such as health and financial information.\u201d\n Zoom quickly admitted it was wrong, prompting the company to launch  a 90-day turnaround effort, which included the rollout of end-to-end encryption to its users. That eventually months later  in late October \u2014 but not without another backtrack after Zoom initially said  free users could not use end-to-end encryption.\n The FTC also alleged in its complaint that Zoom stored some meeting recordings unencrypted on its servers for up to two months, and compromised the security of its users by covertly installing a web server on its users\u2019 computers in order for users to jump into meetings faster. This, the FTC said, \u201cwas unfair and violated the FTC Act.\u201d Zoom pushed out an update which removed the web server, but Apple  also intervened to remove the vulnerable component from its customers\u2019 computers.\n In its statement, the FTC said it has prohibited Zoom from misrepresenting its security and privacy practices going forward, and has agreed to start a vulnerability management program and implement stronger security across its internal network.", "posttime": "2020-11-10 00:19:05", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

"note_en": "This morning, news that a trial COVID-19 vaccine candidate had an effective rate of more than 90% shook  the financial world. The Pfizer vaccine is reportedl;y so effective, the company \u201cwill have manufactured enough doses to immunize 15 to 20 million people\u201d by the end of the year,  according to the New York Times, appears to have given investors the green light to pile back into companies harmed by the pandemic.\n  The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it  every morning on Extra Crunch, or get  The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.\n  The shift of money from shares that  proved popular during the summer is massive and abrupt. Zoom and Peloton are down sharply this morning, while Uber and Lyft are soaring. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 indices are up around 4.8% and 3.3% respectively, while SaaS and cloud share are off 3.5%.\n Investors are taking money out of companies that were expected to do well thanks to the pandemic and moving that capital into firms that were weakened by\u00a0the pandemic.\n Our question for this morning: what do these changes mean for the economic forces that have broadly favored venture-backed startups? What happens to high-flying startups if the pandemic trade flips? What\u2019s next for insurtech, edtech, fintech and SaaS? Let\u2019s discuss.\n  Short-term market movements do not always predict the future accurately, so we should not treat today\u2019s trading as gospel.\n That said, it\u2019s not hard to draw some basic conclusions from the trading activity. Here\u2019s what I think we can deduce from today\u2019s stock market activity:\n Corporate software spend growth will slow: The broad decline in the value of software companies today appears to indicate that investors expect slower growth in the future. This is especially sharp in companies boosted by the pandemic itself, and, it appears, less acute in companies that were less helped by the COVID-19 economy. Our read? Investors are betting that growth amongst the companies that most benefited from a switch to remote work, for example, will see the greatest deceleration from recent forecasts.  For startups, the lesson here is plain.

Earlier this year Waymo, the self-driving unit of Alphabet Inc raised $3 billion, helping to boost the total raised in 2020 by autonomous car companies to $7.1 billion as of November 4, according to data firm PitchBook. While that slightly exceeds 2019\u2019s total, it falls short of the record $9.4 billion raised in 2018. Also far fewer startups are getting funded.\n  Early last year Nuro raised $940 million from SoftBank and a source close to the company said the valuation doubled from that last funding round to $5 billion.\n This round was led by T. Rowe Price Associates and includes new investors Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, LLC. and Baillie Gifford. Existing investors SoftBank and Greylock also participated.\n  The funding will help Nuro expand its team but also scale up manufacturing, said Nuro co-founder Dave Ferguson. Its R2 vehicle is currently manufactured in Detroit with Roush Enterprises, but he declined to say how many were produced and on the road today.\n The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in February gave Nuro approval to deploy up to 5,000 R2 vehicles on public roads every year, said Ferguson. They currently drive around in Houston, Texas, Scottsdale, Arizona, and nine cities in California.\n Nuro is currently using Prius cars outfitted with its self-driving technology to deliver groceries and prescriptions for Kroger and CVS in Houston. Ferguson said in the \u201cnext couple of quarters\u201d the R2 would be doing the deliveries to \u201cramp up a full unmanned delivery service\u201d.", "posttime": "2020-11-10 00:17:32", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8f6f\u94f6,investment", "title": "\u6d88\u606f\u4eba\u58eb\u79f0\uff0c\u57282019\u5e74\u521d\u8f6f\u94f6(SoftBank)\u6295\u8d449.4\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u540e\uff0c\u4ee5T.Rowe Price\u4e3a\u9996\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9001\u8d27\u516c\u53f8NURO\u4ee550\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4f30\u503c\u7b79\u96c6\u4e865\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143", "title_en": "Self-driving delivery company Nuro raises $500M, source says at a $5B valuation, led by T.
