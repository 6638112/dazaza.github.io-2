Her mom helped her log in. Ninety minutes later, kindergarten was over for Annika. For good.</p><p>五年来，已经知道她的信件和基本的减法，Annika Dunlap在8月下旬坐下来，为她的第一天幼儿园。她的妈妈帮助了她登录。九十分钟后，幼儿园结束了Annika。为了好。</p><p>    “We decided, this is not for a 5-year-old,” said her mom, Nahoko Dunlap, 39. “The teacher was great, and I was really hoping she would love her teacher, but asking a 5-year-old to sit in front of a computer for 90 minutes wasn’t ideal.”</p><p>    “我们决定，这不是一个5岁的孩子，”她妈妈说，妈妈，Nahoko Dunlap，39.“老师很棒，我真的希望她能爱她的老师，但是要求一个5岁的人坐在电脑前90分钟并不理想。“</p><p> After that one morning session, Dunlap, a scientist who grew up in Japan, withdrew Annika from kindergarten at her local public elementary school in Fremont, California. She and her husband, who works as a software engineer, felt that Annika’s social experience was more important than any academic progress she might make in remote kindergarten.</p><p> 之后，在早晨会议上，一位在日本长大的科学家邓劳布，在加利福尼亚州弗里蒙特的当地公共小学的幼儿园中撤回了幼儿园。她和她的丈夫作为软件工程师，据认为，安妮卡的社会经历比她在远程幼儿园所做的任何学术进展更重要。</p><p> “In person, you are learning from each other, but when it comes to virtual school, you’re not having conversations, so I didn’t see many positives of virtual learning,” Dunlap said. “She learned to mute and unmute.”</p><p> “亲自，你正在彼此学习，但是当谈到虚拟学校时，你就没有对话，所以我没有看到虚拟学习的许多积极，”Dunlap说。 “她学会了静音和取消静音。”</p><p> Today Annika attends the Little Mud Puddles Learning Center, a private preschool, with her 3-year-old brother. Her mom works with her on phonics and reading in the evenings, and hopes she will be ready for first grade this fall. The tuition at Little Mud Puddles is $1,400 a month per child, which is typical for the Bay Area, but the Dunlaps get a discount for sending two children and pay $2,660 every month. It’s a stretch, as Nahoko Dunlap is working only part time while attending college to make a career change.</p><p> 今天Annika参加了一个私人学龄前的小泥水坑学习中心，与她的3岁的兄弟。她的妈妈在夜晚与她一起工作，并希望她将在今年秋天准备好一年级。小泥水坑的学费为每人1,400美元，这是湾区典型的，但Dunlaps为送两个孩子获得折扣，每月支付2,660美元。这是一个伸展，因为Nahoko Dunlap仅在参加学院的兼职工作时兼职，以提出职业变化。</p><p>  “Kindergarten didn’t seem too critical,” she said. “It’s not mandatory in California, and that made us feel that she’s better off in person.”</p><p>  “幼儿园似乎似乎不太关心，”她说。 “在加利福尼亚州不是强制性的，这让我们觉得她觉得她亲自更好。”</p><p>  Last fall, parents of 5-year-olds across the country went through the same calculation. Kindergarten, a foundational grade for young children, is typically  the first year of elementary school, even in the  31 states where it isn’t required. But faced with the substitution of online kindergarten or, where school is offered in person, the risk that bigger school settings pose of contracting the coronavirus, a widespread number of parents chose something else, even if it meant paying for it.</p><p>  去年秋天，全国各地5岁的父母经历了同样的计算。幼儿园是幼儿的基础等级，通常是小学的第一年，即使在不需要的31个州。但面临着在线幼儿园的替代，或者在这里提供学校的替代，较大的学校环境占冠心病的风险，即使它意味着付出代价，也是别人的父母。 </p><p> In the absence of official national data, independent analyses have tried to quantify this year’s shift away from kindergarten. According to  reporting by NPR, kindergarten enrollment in districts across the country dropped by an average of 16 percent.  Another analysis shows that this drop accounts for nearly a third of the total reduction in public school enrollment across 33 states.  The decline might be greater among white families, which presumably have more resources for alternatives. In Oregon, for example, many more white families kept their children out of kindergarten than Black or Latino families there, according to reporting by The Oregonian, the state’s largest newspaper.</p><p>在没有官方国家数据的情况下，独立的分析试图量化今年远离幼儿园的转变。根据NPR的报告，全国各地的幼儿园入学平均下降了16％。另一个分析表明，这一下跌占公共学校入学总数的近三分之一。白人家庭中的下降可能更大，这可能有更多的资源来替代。例如，在俄勒冈州国家最大的报纸的报道，许多白人家庭将孩子们不在那里的黑人或拉丁裔家庭脱离幼儿园。</p><p> School districts and early childhood experts that are tracking the opting out of  kindergarten report that some 5-year-olds are attending impromptu kindergarten classes offered by private preschools, while others are enrolled in online charter or for-profit schools. Some well-to-do families hire tutors — sometimes paying a teacher’s salary — to work alongside a child who is  attending remote kindergarten. Other families are skipping the school year entirely.</p><p> 学区和幼儿专家正在跟踪幼儿园报告，其中大约5岁的孩子正在参加私人学龄前提供的幼儿园课程，而其他人则参加在线宪章或营业学校。一些富裕的家庭雇佣导师 - 有时支付教师的薪水 - 与参加远程幼儿园的孩子一起工作。其他家庭完全跳过学年。</p><p>  The haphazard array of alternatives has early education leaders worried. While any kindergarten class reflects a variety of school readiness, kindergarten and first grade teachers will likely encounter a wider preparedness gap this fall. More children may be off track, not just academically but also emotionally and even physically, exacerbating inequities along class and racial lines.</p><p>  随意的替代方案有早期教育领导者担心。虽然任何幼儿园班都反映了各种学校准备，但幼儿园和一年级的教师可能会遇到这一秋天的更广泛的准备差距。更多儿童可能是偏离轨道，而不仅仅是学术而且在情感上甚至身体上，沿着阶级和种族线加剧的不公平。</p><p>  “This does not balance out in favor of lower-income families,” said Steven Barnett, senior co-director of the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) at Rutgers University. “It’s a problem across the board for a whole cohort of kids, but the consequences are going to be the greatest for the most disadvantaged.”</p><p>  “这不赞成低收入家庭，”罗格斯大学国家早教研究所（NIEER）高级公司高级公司史蒂文巴内特表示。 “这是整个孩子队队的委员会的一个问题，但后果将是最贫困的最大损失。”</p><p>  Specifics about who isn’t attending kindergarten are spotty and mostly anecdotal. Some districts followed up with families to ask why they didn’t enroll their 5-year-olds and what their plans were, but even then the picture lacked detail. When officials at Harrison School District 2, which serves some of the poorest neighborhoods in Colorado Springs, Colorado, queried families that had not enrolled for kindergarten, most reported choosing one of four alternatives: home schooling, private or parochial school, charter school or skipping kindergarten altogether.</p><p>  关于谁没有参加幼儿园的具体细节是斑点，主要是轶事。有些地区跟进家庭，要求为什么他们没有报名参加5岁的孩子以及他们的计划是什么，但即使那么图片缺乏细节。当哈里森学区的官员提供了科罗拉多州的一些贫困社区，科罗拉多州的一些贫困社区时，没有注册幼儿园的Quered家庭，最多报道选择四个替代品中的一个：家庭教育，私人或纪念学校，宪章学校或跳跃幼儿园总共。</p><p> “I am very concerned for this group of kids,” said  Wendy Birhanzel, the district’s superintendent. “We will have to watch this cohort even through their senior year. They will be starting with a gap.”</p><p> “我非常关心这群孩子，”该地区的主管Wendy Birhanzel说。 “即使通过高年级，我们也将不得不观看这个队列。他们将从差距开始。“</p><p> Kindergarten enrollment in Harrison is down about 10 percent this year, and about 60 percent of the “missing” children are Hispanic English learners. This concerns Birhanzel because preschool enrollment is also down in the community, so some children who register in the fall may never have been in school at all. The district is open for in-person instruction with an option for remote.</p><p> 哈里森的幼儿园招生下降了大约10％，约有60％的“失踪”的孩子是西班牙裔英语学习者。这令人担忧了Birhanzel，因为幼儿园入学也在社区中，所以一些在秋天登记的孩子可能永远不会在学校。该区对偏远的选项开放的内部教学。 </p><p> Students who are learning English “need as much time in front of a teacher as they can get,” she said. “It’s a grave concern that this is just one more year for them of not being exposed to English.”</p><p>她说，学习英语的学生“需要在老师面前的时间，”她说。 “这是一个严重的担忧，这对他们没有暴露在英语之外的一年中。”</p><p> Just five years ago, the district was celebrating having narrowed the proficiency gaps between white, Black and Latino students and bringing test scores in all subjects closer together by revamping curriculum, focusing on different learning styles and eliminating barriers to AP classes. This year may set that progress back.</p><p> 就在五年前，该地区正在庆祝，缩小了白色，黑人和拉丁裔学生之间的熟练态度，并通过改造课程将所有受试者的测试分数带入，专注于不同的学习风格，消除AP课程的障碍。今年可能会让这一进步恢复。</p><p> “When he was in [online] kindergarten he would look at me and say, ‘Why are you making me do this?’”</p><p> “当他在[在线]幼儿园时，他会看着我并说，”你为什么让我这样做？“”</p><p> Ann Voong, parent</p><p> Ann Voong，父母</p><p> “Any time you talk about achievement gaps, and you have a group of students not coming to school, there’s concern,” Birhanzel said. “Once that gap is created, it’s so much harder to close. We’re going to have to put extra resources through the grades, so this cohort can graduate on time.”</p><p> “任何时候你谈论成就差距，你有一群没有上学的学生，就会担心，”Birhanzel说。 “一旦创造了那个差距，它就会更难关闭。我们将不得不通过渐变来将额外的资源放在等级，所以这队列可以按时毕业。“</p><p> In normal years, Harrison District 2 offers a summer program for kids entering third grade through high school. This year, that program will include incoming kindergartners and rising first graders. Assuming the coronavirus is under control, kids will build academic skills, do music and physical education and take field trips (pandemic restrictions permitting). The district will also administer diagnostic testing before school starts to make grade placement and support decisions, reduce class sizes and teach in small groups to address gaps.</p><p> 哈里森区2纪念日，哈里森区2为通过高中进入三年级的儿童提供夏季计划。今年，该计划将包括传入的幼儿园和崛起的第一年级学生。假设冠状病毒受到控制，孩子们将建立学术技能，做音乐和体育和实地考察（大流行限制允许）。该区还将在学校开始拨款和支持决策之前进行诊断测试，减少班级规模，并以小组教学以解决差距。</p><p> Kindergarten-age children who aren’t enrolled in school this year are missing out on crucial academic instruction, Birhanzel said, “and that’s not even talking about the social learning — listening to the teacher, making friends.”</p><p> Birhanzel说，今年没有在学校注册学校的幼儿园儿童，“这甚至没有谈论社会学习 - 听老师，交朋友。” </p><p>  School attendance isn’t critical just for academic progress. Many families rely on their schools for counseling services, after-school programs, health clinics and physical safety. In addition, the physical education and meals that children get at school play a key role in addressing childhood obesity.</p><p>学校出勤并不重要只是在学术进步。许多家庭依赖他们的学校咨询服务，课后计划，健康诊所和身体安全。此外，孩子们在学校获得的体育和膳食在解决儿童肥胖方面发挥着关键作用。</p><p> “All of the weight gain problems turn out to be in the summer,” NIEER’s Barnett said. “It turns out there is a poorer diet and less activity in the summer.”</p><p> “所有的体重增加问题都在夏天，”Nieer的Barnett说。 “事实证明，夏季饮食较差，活动较少。”</p><p> Affluent parents can pay for an extra year of preschool or a tutor, while many nonmedical frontline jobs pay lower wages, leaving lower-income families with fewer options to support kids in distance learning.</p><p> 富裕的父母可以支付额外的幼儿园或导师的费用，而许多非医学前线就业职位将较低的工资支付较低的工资，留下较低的家庭，其中包括在远程学习中支持孩子的较少选择。</p><p> But in some cities, local organizations responded early in the pandemic and established free or low-cost centers where children could get support while attending remote school.</p><p> 但在一些城市，当地组织在大流行早期回应，并建立了自由或低成本中心，儿童在参加遥远的学校时可以得到支持。</p><p> In Wilmington, Delaware, the city partnered with local school districts and United Way to operate 26 learning pods where children receive a Chromebook and can attend all day for free.</p><p> 在威尔明顿，特拉华州，该城市与当地学区和联合之路一起运营26个学习豆荚，儿童收到Chromebook，可以免费参加。</p><p> “This isn’t a Boys and Girls Club,” said Michelle Taylor, president and CEO of United Way of Delaware. “Parents have to work. If my kid is at home, how do I know they’re in their class? This is as much about ensuring kids have a safe, caring environment to excel as it is getting the supports in place.”</p><p> “这不是一个男孩和女孩俱乐部，”特拉华州联合之路总裁兼首席执行官Michelle Taylor说。 “父母必须工作。如果我的孩子在家，我怎么知道他们在班上？这与确保孩子们有一个安全，关怀的环境，因为它得到支持而擅长的。“</p><p> About 700 Delaware children attend these pods, which are located in high-need neighborhoods. In order to keep their spots, students have to commit to attend 85 percent of the time and to get 85 percent of their schoolwork done while they are there. Paraprofessional teachers, who work for the school district and live in the pods’ neighborhoods, work with groups of 10 children.</p><p> 大约700名特拉华州儿童参加这些豆荚，位于高需求街区。为了保持他们的斑点，学生必须承诺参加85％的时间，并在那里获得85％的学业。 Parafrofessional教师，为学区工作，生活在豆荚的社区，与10名儿童一起工作。 </p><p> “When it comes to virtual school, you’re not having conversations, so I didn’t see many positives of virtual learning.”</p><p>“当谈到虚拟学校时，你就没有对话，所以我没有看到虚拟学习的许多积极。”</p><p> Nahoko Dunlap, parent</p><p> Nahoko Dunlap，父母</p><p> “We’re working to make sure the [achievement] gap doesn’t get any wider,” Taylor said. “Over the summer, we are hoping we can focus on catch-up, on closing the gap.”</p><p> “我们正在努力确保[成就]差距不会得到任何更宽的，”泰勒说。 “在夏天，我们希望我们能够专注于追逐差距。”</p><p> Even when there is an adult present to help a young child with remote school, some children simply cannot focus for the amount of time required.</p><p> 即使有成年人提供帮助一个幼儿遥远的学校，一些孩子也无法专注于所需的时间。</p><p> “It’s a very, very steep learning curve for these kids,” said Debra Zweben, child development specialist at Children’s Village, a nonprofit education center in Philadelphia. “Young children cannot have a personal connection to a teacher through a screen. It’s not realistic. So much of kindergarten is the relationship to the teacher in person.”</p><p> “为这些孩子们来说，这是一个非常非常陡峭的学习曲线，”费城非营利教育中心儿童村儿童发展专家德布拉·Zweben说。 “幼儿不能通过屏幕与老师有个人联系。这不是现实的。很多幼儿园都是与老师的关系。“</p><p> Grouped in age-based pods and wearing headsets, children attend their remote school classes from computers in Children’s Village’s  building in the Center City neighborhood. An in-person teacher helps them sign in and get used to Zoom or Google Classroom. There are breaks for lunch, snacks and some outdoor play, but kids spend most of the day on their own, on a computer.</p><p> 在基于年龄为基础的豆荚和佩戴耳机中分组，孩子们在中心城市附近的儿童村庄建筑的计算机上参加他们的遥理课程。一个人的老师帮助他们登录并习惯于缩放或谷歌教室。午餐，小吃和一些户外游戏中有休息时间，但孩子们在计算机上占据了大部分时间。</p><p> “Ethan didn’t want to wear the headsets, and we got three different kinds,” said</p><p> “Ethan不想戴耳机，我们有三种不同的种类，”说 </p><p>  Ann Voong, 40, whose son attended remote kindergarten at Children’s Village for about three months. “He would just get up and do what he wanted. I can’t just strap him down to his seat.”</p><p>40岁的Ann Voong，他的儿子参加了儿童村庄的远程幼儿园约三个月。 “他只会起床，做他想做的事。我不能把他拉到座位上。“</p><p> Voong adjusted her schedule at work, in the human resources department of a home health agency, and kept Ethan at home in the mornings so she could help him with remote kindergarten. Then she’d drop him off at Children’s Village in the afternoon and go to work, but that didn’t go well either.</p><p> voong在卫生机构的人力资源部门调整了她的时间表，在早上保留了家里的Ethan，所以她可以帮助他与偏远的幼儿园。然后她下午在孩子们的村庄掉了他，去上班，但也没有顺利。</p><p> “I would sit with him from 8 to 12 and then drop him off after lunch, but he got drained from it. He would be so tired from the day,” she said. “I want him to enjoy school. I want him to like it. If I take out a book, I want him to be excited about it.  He used to be excited about it.”</p><p> “我会和他坐在8到12岁，然后午饭后把他放下，但他从中排出了掉。她从白天那么累了，“她说。 “我希望他享受学校。我希望他喜欢它。如果我拿出一本书，我希望他对此感到兴奋。他曾经对此感到兴奋。“</p><p> Ethan, who is 5, is still at Children’s Village, but in a preschool classroom. Voong withdrew him from kindergarten, giving up a spot at an in-demand public school that she had secured by getting in line at 5 a.m. on registration day. Now she is waiting to hear if he has a spot in kindergarten at that same school this fall.</p><p> 埃桑是5，仍在儿童村，但在学龄前儿童课堂上。 voong撤回了他幼儿园，放弃了一个在需求的公立学校，她通过在上午5点到5点抵达。现在她等着听到他在同一所学校在幼儿园上有一个现场。</p><p> “I just want him to be happy,” she said. “We’ve taken so many things away from him [during the pandemic], like sports and playing at the playground. When he was in kindergarten he would look at me and say, ‘Why are you making me do this?’”</p><p> “我只是希望他快乐，”她说。 “我们从他的[流行病中]等很多东西，就像运动和在操场上玩耍。当他在幼儿园时，他会看着我说，“你为什么让我这样做？”“</p><p>  Assessing children for grade-level readiness and building necessary supports may be the best tools that districts have to address potential gaps. In Yakima, Washington, the West Valley School District saw a 20 percent drop in expected kindergarten enrollment last fall. Elementary schools in the district are open for face-to-face instruction. Like Harrison School District 2, the West Valley district is  now planning a summer program for all grades, followed by assessments and conversations with parents to discuss the best grade assignment and any necessary supports.</p><p>  评估儿童进行等级级别准备和建立必要的支持可能是地区必须解决潜在差距的最佳工具。在华盛顿亚基玛，西山山区的入学期间，西山谷学区的预计幼儿园入学率为20％。该区的小学是面对面教学的开放。与哈里森学区2，西谷区现在计划为所有等级计划进行夏季计划，然后与父母进行评估和对话，讨论最佳等级分配和任何必要的支持。</p><p> “We want to be proactive in placement rather than having children go into first grade, have struggles, and then have to move them back,” said Peter Finch, assistant superintendent for learning and teaching. About 40 percent of West Valley students are Hispanic, and 42 percent qualify for free or reduced-price lunch.</p><p> “我们希望积极主动，而不是拥有孩子们进入一年级，有挣扎，然后必须将他们搬回，”彼得芬奇，学习和教学的助理主管说。大约40％的西山谷学生是西班牙裔，42％的额外午餐有资格。 </p><p> But Finch isn’t worried about an achievement gap, at least not in the primary grades, even with so many children not attending kindergarten. West Valley’s “personalized learning” approach translates state standards into badges that children earn at their own pace. Classrooms are also amply staffed, with student teachers from a local college assisting the lead teacher.</p><p>但芬奇并不担心成就差距，至少不是在主要成绩中，即使有这么多儿童没有参加幼儿园。西谷的“个性化学习”方法将国家标准转化为儿童以自己的步伐赚取的徽章。教室也充分赞成，学生教师来自当地大学的协助主任教师。</p><p> “You walk into classrooms, and there will be five adults working with five small groups,” he said. “We have a station rotation model. Students learn at their own pace. When they’re ready to show what they know, we do an assessment and they get the badge.”</p><p> “你走进教室，将有五个成年人使用五个小团体，”他说。 “我们有一个站旋转模型。学生以自己的节奏学习。当他们准备展示他们所知道的东西时，我们做评估，他们得到徽章。“</p><p>  Kim Noyes, principal of Centennial Elementary in Colorado Springs’ Harrison School District 2, is also optimistic that individualized instruction with robust support will be enough to support children who come to school after missing the crucial kindergarten year.</p><p>  Colorado Springs'Harrison学区2的百年小学校长Kim Noyes也是乐观的，即强劲支持的个性化教学将足以支持在错过了关键的幼儿园年后上学的孩子。</p><p> “A lot of families are doing what they can at home,” she said. But she does expect to see more readiness gaps. In addition to diagnostic testing, Noyes said her teachers will tap into the district’s curriculum and resource department to identify specific supports. “Even in the first grade, we are going to be maximizing group learning and smaller class sizes to help fill holes. It’s a tricky time right now, but I think we’re well equipped, and our resources can be focused.”</p><p> “很多家庭都在做他们在家中可以做的事情，”她说。但她确实希望看到更多的准备情况差距。除了诊断测试外，诺伊斯表示，她的老师将挖掘该地区的课程和资源部门以确定特定的支持。 “即使在一年级，我们也将最大化组学习和较小的班级尺寸，以帮助填充孔。现在是一个棘手的时间，但我认为我们的设备很好，我们的资源可以集中注意力。“</p><p> Not everyone agrees that assessing children before making a grade assignment will lead to the best outcomes. Many experts worry that tests don’t capture a child’s capacity to learn quickly and catch up.</p><p> 不是每个人都同意在制定成绩的转让之前评估儿童会导致最佳成果。许多专家担心测试不会捕捉孩子快速学习并赶上的孩子的能力。</p><p> “I would be careful about assessment,” said Rhian Alvin, CEO of the National Association for the Education of Young Children. “We have a long, nasty history of assessing children to sort and characterize.”</p><p> “我会小心评估，”幼儿教育协会首席执行官Rhian Alvin说。 “我们在评估儿童排序和表征的历史悠久的历史记录。”</p><p> “Teachers will have to watch and be sure they don’t become frustrated about the outcome of the pandemic, and take it out on the students.”</p><p> “教师将不得不观看，并确保他们对大流行的结果没有沮丧，并将其拿出来。” </p><p> Bweikia Steen, associate professor of education</p><p>Bweikia Steen，教育副教授</p><p> There will be a gap between parents who have been able to provide recreational and learning opportunities despite the pandemic and those who have not, Alvin predicted. And catching up those left behind will be expensive, too, she said.</p><p> 尽管有大流行和那些没有，但是，父母在父母之间存在娱乐和学习机会之间存在差距。她说，赶上留下的人会昂贵。</p><p> To start, teachers will need professional development and ongoing coaching so they can help kids make up for lost learning time.</p><p> 首先，教师需要专业的发展和持续的教练，以便他们可以帮助孩子弥补丧失学习时间。</p><p> “Teachers will have to watch and be sure they don’t become frustrated about the outcome of the pandemic, and take it out on the students,” said Bweikia Steen, associate professor of education at George Mason University. “It’s not their fault what’s happened over this past year.”</p><p> “教师将不得不观察，并确保他们对大流行的结果没有沮丧，并将其拿出来，”乔治梅森大学教育副教授Bweikia Steen说。 “这不是他们过去一年发生的错误。”</p><p> If a child is behind academically or socially, it isn’t necessarily because the parents weren’t engaged, Steen said. Many parents are working hard to make ends meet, which may leave less or very little time for reading with their kids. Teachers may need training to understand individual family circumstances, she said, so they can provide thoughtful support. She is optimistic that quality instruction can meet the needs of children who have missed a year of school.</p><p> Steen说，如果一个孩子在学者或社会上落后于学术或社会，这并不是因为父母没有订婚。许多父母努力努力使他们能够留下少或很少的时间来阅读他们的孩子。她说，教师可能需要培训来了解个人家庭情况，所以他们可以提供周到的支持。她乐观的是，质量教育可以满足遗漏了一年的儿童的需求。</p><p> “If we go into the fall the same way we go into any new year, thinking, ‘I’m going to have a range of students who have a range of experiences, and it’s my job to meet each individual child’s needs,’ it’ll be fine,” Steen said.  “Will it be easy? No. But I’m not saying it’s going to be doomsday.”</p><p> “如果我们进入与新年一样进入堕落，思考，”我将拥有一系列有一系列经验的学生，而且我的工作是认识每个孩子的需要，“它“LL没问题，”斯丁说。 “这会很容易吗？不，但我不是说这将是世界末日。“</p><p> This story about  kindergarten enrollment was produced by  The Hechinger Report , a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.
