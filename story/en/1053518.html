On her sickbed, she continued to search through her notes from late last year, looking for anything my father David, who wrote as  John le Carré, might have written that would otherwise be missing from the body of work he left behind. It was an unnecessary labour; we have everything, and we had it then. While I didn’t want to take away something that was a mainstay of her life, I was concerned that she was growing unhappy in the search for new material that did not exist.</p><p>    在她去世前一点 - 当它似乎可能有几乎没有时间剩下的时间，从几天到几个月 - 我搞砸了我的勇气，并向我的母亲建议，鉴于她82岁，患有显着的终端癌症，它对退休或者失败，每周休息一下，可能还不为时尚早。在她的病床上，她继续从去年年底通过她的票据进行搜索，寻找我父亲大卫的任何东西，他写作JohnLeCaré，可能已经写过，否则他留下的工作机构就会失踪。这是一个不必要的劳动力;我们拥有一切，我们有了它。虽然我不想带走一些是她生命中的一个主要的东西，但我担心她在寻找不存在的新材料中不满意。</p><p> She looked back at me as if I’d said she should grow wings.</p><p> 她回头看着我，好像我说她应该成长翅膀。</p><p>    I suggested a short list of diversions: talk, eat, watch cricket or snooker – they both loved sport – or some of the films on her endlessly postponed watch list.</p><p>    我建议改进的简短列表：谈话，吃，看球手表或斯诺克 - 他们都喜欢运动 - 或者在她无休止推迟的观看名单上的一些电影。</p><p>  For as long as I can remember, my parents have been defined by the work they did together, and by a working relationship so interwoven with their personal one that the two were actually inseparable. David’s first report of Jane, long before I was born, was that she had rescued his novel A Small Town in Germany when it was literally in pieces on the floor. Some of my earliest memories are of him reading, handwritten pages or typescript with annotations in black pen, sometimes physically cut and pasted in the days before computers, and her listening, absorbing, only occasionally responding, but always with immediate effect.</p><p>  只要我能记住，我的父母已经被他们一起做的工作所定义，并且通过工作关系与他们的个人交织在一起，这两个人实际上是不可分割的。大卫的第一个简贾恩的报告，在我出生之前，她在德国救出了他的小镇，当它在地板上的碎片中。我最早的一些记忆是他阅读，手写的页面或类型，手写的页面或打字标注用黑色笔注释，有时在电脑前的日子里物理切割和粘贴，以及她的听力，吸收，偶尔响应，但总是立即效果。</p><p> It was easy to misunderstand her as just a typist – and many did – not only because she also typed everything, as he never learned how, but also because her interventions were made in private, before the text was ever seen by anyone else. I was witness to it as a child and then as a teenager, but by and large only they knew what passed between them and how much she reframed, adjusted, trained the novels as they grew. She was adamant that her contribution was not writing, that the creative partnership they had was uneven. She declined interviews and stepped out of photographs – even family ones, so that as we were looking this week for images for the order of service at her cremation, we had very few, and those were stolen moments gleaned before she could practise her invisibility trick. It was part of how it worked: he produced, they edited; he burned, she fanned. It was their conspiracy, the thing that no one else could ever offer him, in which they both connived.</p><p> 很容易误解她只是一个打字员 - 许多人都这样做 - 不仅因为她也是键入了一切，因为他从未学得如何，也因为她的干预措施是私下的，所以在别人的看法之前。我作为一个孩子见证了它，然后作为一个少年，但是只有他们知道他们之间的东西，以及她重新训练，调整了多少小说，训练了这部小说。她坚持认为，她的贡献没有写作，他们的创造性伙伴关系是不平衡的。她拒绝了采访，避开了照片 - 即使是家庭，也是如此，我们在这一周拍摄了她的火化的服务令的图像，我们很少，在她可以练习她的隐形技巧之前，那些被盗的时刻被偷走了。这是它如何运作的一部分：他们制作了，他们编辑了;他烧了，她煽动了。这是他们的阴谋，没有其他人能够为他提供的东西，他们都很漂亮。</p><p>  Very few, very wise people saw through them both, of whom the most recent and the most absolute is Richard Ovenden, who examined the papers my father loaned to the Bodleian library in Oxford and observed a “deep process of collaboration”. His analysis is a perfect match for my recollection: “A rhythm of working together that was incredibly efficient … a kind of cadence from manuscript, to typescript, to annotated and amended typescripts … with scissors and staplers being brought to bear … getting closer and closer to the final published version.”</p><p>  很少有人，非常聪明的人通过他们看到，其中最近和最绝对的是理查德奥维登，他审查了父亲在牛津借给博德梅图书馆的论文，并观察了“深刻的合作过程”。他的分析是我回顾的完美匹配：“一起工作的节奏是令人难以置信的......稿件的一种节奏，给打字标注和修改的打字标语......与剪刀和订书机带来熊......越来越近到最后发布的版本。“ </p><p> Exactly that: at each turn, fresh problems to be solved, fresh insights and flourishes of invention. And all along, at every step, was Jane, recalling the first moment of inspiration to refresh a tired passage, or asking whether a given phrase really reflected the intent she knew was behind it. She was never dramatic; she was ubiquitous and persisting throughout the body of work.</p><p>正是如此：在每个转弯时，要解决的新问题，本发明的新洞察力和繁荣。一切都在，在每一步，是简，召回了刷新疲惫的段落的第一时刻，或者询问给定的短语是否真的反映了她所知道的意图。她从不戏剧;在整个工作的身体中，她无处不在和持续存在。</p><p> As they both became ill in their later years, it only revealed the extent of the mutual support and mutual dependency. They might struggle, as everyone does after 80, to remember things in casual conversation, but in work each could rely on the other to make the connection, to pick up the slack when a brilliant but ageing mind suddenly stuttered. As a team – more, as a single process functioning between two people, defining them both – they were immune to the halting state.</p><p> 因为他们在晚年中既生病了，它只透露了相互支持和相互依赖的程度。他们可能会挣扎，因为每个人都在80之后，记住随意谈话中的东西，但在工作中，每个人都可以依靠另一个来建立联系，当一个辉煌但老龄化的心灵突然口吃时拿起松弛。作为一个团队 - 更多，作为两个人之间的单一进程，定义它们都是 - 它们对停留状态的免疫。</p><p> It was a wonderful thing, but the more painful, when he died rather abruptly in December, to see her deprived of the other half of her way of thinking across five decades. She was casting around for who might be holding the part of herself that she had vested in him, looking for the rest of the process that was trying to continue in her – hence the search for the missing material, the determination to keep going, because to stop working was to die again.</p><p> 这是一件很棒的事情，但当他在12月突然突然死亡时，更加痛苦，看到她剥夺了她在五十年来剥夺了另一半的思考方式。她正在追求谁，谁可能掌握自己，她归属于他，寻找正在努力继续在她身上的其余过程 - 因此寻求缺失的材料，决心继续前进，因为停止工作就是再次死去。</p><p> Nick Cornwell writes novels under the pen name  Nick Harkaway.
