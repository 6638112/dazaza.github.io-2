So, what changed that made what had been bulky systems go from clumsy pipe dreams to hardened, miniaturized, and reliable weapons that will be able to be deployed even in the harshest of conditions?</p><p> 经过数十年的辛劳和无尽的努力，激光操作武器的梦想即将成为现实。那么，是什么改变了使笨重的系统从笨拙的梦想变成了即使在最恶劣的条件下也可以部署的硬化，小型化和可靠的武器？</p><p> We recently had an in-depth interview with Dr. Rob Afzal, Lockheed Martin Senior Fellow, Laser and Sensor Systems, where I pressed him on everything related to laser weaponry and the emerging military applications that go along with it. In the course of answering my maelstrom of queries, Dr. Afzal eloquently conveyed how we have suddenly arrived in an era where laser weapons will become widespread across the battlefield. In this first piece in our two-part series with Lockheed&#39;s directed energy guru, I wanted to share his explanation with you, as it is fascinating in its own right.</p><p> 我们最近对洛克希德·马丁公司激光与传感器系统高级研究员Rob Afzal博士进行了深入采访，在其中，我向他介绍了与激光武器及其相关的新兴军事应用有关的所有问题。在回答我的疑问的过程中，阿夫扎尔博士雄辩地表达了我们是如何突然到达一个激光武器将在整个战场上普及的时代的。在我们与洛克希德的定向能源专家组成的两部分系列的第一篇中，我想与您分享他的解释，因为它本身就很有趣。</p><p>  Here, as it was conveyed to me directly, is what technological developments have made the dawn of laser warfare possible according to Dr. Afzal:</p><p>  根据Afzal博士的说法，在这里，正如直接传达给我的，技术发展使激光战的曙光成为可能：</p><p> &#34;If you think back, that the laser is actually invented in roughly 1960. So, it begs the question, that&#39;s 50 years—why aren&#39;t there laser weapons all over the place today? There are really two reasons for that.</p><p> “如果回想一下，激光实际上是在1960年左右发明的。那么，它引出了一个问题，那就是50年了-为什么今天不存在激光武器？这确实有两个原因。</p><p> The first reason is that the initial application they envisioned for the laser weapons is for strategic defense mission; really, the hardest—most difficult technologically—mission that there is, defending the homeland against incoming ballistic missiles. So, first of all, that was extraordinarily difficult, but it did develop a lot of core fundamental technologies and demonstrations that showed that a laser weapon system can be put together, you can do acquisition, tracking, pointing a laser beam, as well as delivering a lethal laser beam to a target, like a boost-phase ballistic missile on  the Airborne Laser program. The issue, though, was that those systems were basically just too big, literally. They were physically too big to really be deployed in the tactical environment, on a truck or on an airplane, even on a ship, without taking up large portions of the ship.</p><p> 第一个原因是他们设想的用于激光武器的最初应用是用于战略防御任务。实际上，这是最艰巨的任务，也是技术上最困难的任务，是保卫祖国免受来袭的弹道导弹的伤害。因此，首先，这非常困难，但是它确实开发了许多核心基础技术和演示，这些技术和演示表明可以将激光武器系统组合在一起，可以进行获取，跟踪，指向激光束以及发射致命的激光束到目标，例如机载激光计划中的助推相弹道导弹。但问题是，从字面上看，这些系统基本上太大了。它们的体积太大，无法真正部署在战术环境中，卡车或飞机上，甚至在轮船上，也不会占用船的大部分空间。</p><p>  Even though the systems were possible, the irony was that the laser technology wasn&#39;t there yet, to make a small enough, powerful enough laser, to be tactically relevant. Now, the threat landscape also started to change, and we went from a strategic defense to a tactical defense. The threats today are really evolving. We&#39;re talking now about  swarms of low-cost, low capability threats, like armed UAVs or large quantities of mortars or rocket barrages. Those systems are shorter range, and many of the systems are... not sophisticated; meaning traditionally sophisticated countermeasures, like jamming and redirecting and things like that, don&#39;t work. Like, for instance, a mortar does not have a guidance system on it. So, there&#39;s not something you can easily do to defend against a mortar. And the timeline of a mortar shot is very short, so you need to  react extraordinarily quickly and be able to defend in a very short period of time.</p><p>  即使系统可行，但具有讽刺意味的是，激光技术尚不存在，无法制造出足够小且功能强大的激光，从而在战术上不切实际。现在，威胁态势也开始发生变化，我们从战略防御转变为战术防御。当今的威胁确实在不断发展。现在，我们谈论的是大量低成本，低能力威胁，例如武装无人机，大量迫击炮或火箭弹。这些系统的射程较短，而且许多系统……不复杂。意味着传统上复杂的对策（例如干扰和重定向）不起作用。例如，砂浆上面没有导向系统。因此，您无法轻松地防御砂浆。而且迫击炮的时间表很短，因此您需要快速做出反应，并能够在很短的时间内进行防御。</p><p> So, the threat landscape is evolved. And then in the technology space, there were two revolutions that really started to take place. The first was fiber-optic telecommunication, so I&#39;ll get to why that&#39;s relevant to directed energy.</p><p>因此，威胁格局在不断演变。然后在技术领域，真正发生了两次革命。首先是光纤电信，所以我来说明为什么这与定向能量有关。</p><p> All of a sudden, in the &#39;90s, billions and billions of dollars started to pour into the development of fiber-optic communications equipment—how to make the optical fiber, how to pull kilometers and kilometers of it with high purity, how to make high-speed electronics to be able to do communications, semiconductor diode lasers to send the data down the fibers. The whole industrial infrastructure for that capability started to really be built out. Then the bubble burst in the early 2000s and a number of the companies that were in that space began looking for new markets that this fiber-optic, fiber-laser technology actually could scale in power to hundreds of watts to kilowatts of optical power. What we found—we, meaning the community—was that that you could do a whole bunch of industrial applications using fiber-laser technology and very cost-effectively. What I mean by that is mainly cutting, welding, and drilling. So, all of a sudden, all sheet metal that&#39;s cut for home appliances and so forth, was starting to be cut by high-power fiber-lasers of the kilowatt-type power levels.</p><p> 突然之间，在90年代，数十亿美元开始投入到光纤通信设备的开发中，例如如何制造光纤，如何以高纯度拉动数公里，如何制造光纤。高速电子设备能够进行通讯，半导体二极管激光器将数据沿着光纤发送。为此功能的整个工业基础设施已经真正建立起来。然后在2000年代初泡沫破裂，当时在该领域的许多公司开始寻找新的市场，这种光纤，光纤激光技术实际上可以将功率扩展到数百瓦到千瓦的光功率。我们的发现-我们的意思是社区-是您可以使用光纤激光器技术并且非常经济高效地进行大量工业应用。我的意思是主要是切割，焊接和钻孔。因此，突然之间，用于家用电器等的所有板材切割都开始被千瓦级功率级别的高功率光纤激光器切割。</p><p>  All the microelectronics and iPhones and so forth, were starting to be drilled and the touch screens were being scribed, and all this whole industrial space opened up, and the reason was that these fiber lasers were very efficient at converting electrical power to optical power. The beam quality that came out of the fiber-laser, meaning the ability for that beam to be focusable, to provide a high-intensity spot to do things, like melt metal and drill holes, the beam quality was very high. So, all of a sudden, the industrial space really opened up and the development of high-power fiber-lasers really, really took off.</p><p>  所有的微电子产品和iPhone等都开始被钻孔，触摸屏被划痕，所有这些工业空间都被打开了，原因是这些光纤激光器在将电能转换为光能方面非常有效。光纤激光器发出的光束质量意味着光束可聚焦，提供高强度光斑来做事的能力，例如熔融金属和钻孔，光束质量非常高。因此，突然之间，工业空间真正打开了，大功率光纤激光器的发展真正开始了。</p><p> That was particularly interesting, except for the fact that the power out of a fiber-laser doesn&#39;t scale to a weapons class, right? It&#39;s one thing to cut metal that&#39;s centimeters away, it&#39;s another thing to take out a mortar at two kilometers. So, the innovation that changed the game in the last five years or so, Lockheed Martin was a real leader or  the leader in this innovation, and the innovation involved bringing together the technologies from fiber-optic communications and the technologies of high-power lasers for industrial applications to figure out a way to scale fiber-lasers to weapons class power.</p><p> 这特别有趣，除了光纤激光器的功率不能扩展到武器级，对吗？切开几厘米远的金属是一回事，而在两公里外拿出研钵则是另一回事。因此，过去五年左右改变游戏规则的创新，洛克希德·马丁公司是这一创新的真正领导者或领导者，并且这项创新涉及将光纤通信技术和大功率激光器技术融合在一起为工业应用找到一种将光纤激光器扩展到武器级功率的方法。</p><p> The way that&#39;s done is, instead of just building a single laser at 50 kilowatts or 100 kilowatts or something like that, we are actually taking individual fiber-lasers and combining the outputs of the beams into a single high-power beam, and we do that using a technique we call Spectral Beam Combination... Fundamentally, what we did was we took something, if you&#39;re familiar with wavelength division multiplexing in telecommunication—how to break up the spectrum that&#39;s available to you into many different laser-lines and send all that light down a fiber to increase your communications bandwidth. So, all of a sudden, we took a large number of fiber-laser channels, all closely spaced in wavelength or in frequency, and then by reflecting those beams off an object. We could call it a grading, or you can think in your mind of it like a prism, the beams all combine into a single output beam. Patty always loves this analogy I use, which is Pink Floyd&#39;s  Dark Side Of The Moon record cover.</p><p> 这样做的方法是，不仅仅是在50千瓦或100千瓦或类似的功率下构建单个激光器，我们实际上是在使用单个光纤激光器，并将光束的输出合并为一个高功率光束，就是说，使用一种我们称为“光谱光束组合”的技术...如果您熟悉电信中的波分复用技术，那么从根本上讲，我们采取了一些措施–如何将可用频谱分解为许多不同的激光线并通过光纤发送所有光线以增加通信带宽。因此，突然之间，我们采用了许多光纤激光器通道，它们在波长或频率上都间隔很近，然后将这些光束反射离开物体。我们可以称其为渐变色，或者您可以像棱镜一样想到它，所有光束合并成一个输出光束。 Patty一直喜欢我使用的这个比喻，这是Pink Floyd的《月之暗面》唱片封面。</p><p>  So, if you look at that prism, there&#39;s a white light beam that comes into the prism and it breaks up into the colors of the rainbow, you could run that in reverse, you could have a whole bunch of beams that cover the different spectrums, and if you put it through the prism, they all combine and output a single beam. We call it kinda the &#39;reverse prism effect.&#39; So what all of a sudden we were able to do was to scale laser power in a modular way. Instead of just trying to build a bigger and bigger laser, we&#39;re actually scaling by  adding lasers up.</p><p>  因此，如果您查看该棱镜，则有一个白色的光束进入棱镜，并分解为彩虹的颜色，您可以反向运行，可以有一束覆盖不同光谱的光束，如果将其穿过棱镜，它们都会合并并输出单个光束。我们称其为“反向棱镜效应”。因此，我们突然能够做的就是以模块化方式缩放激光功率。我们不仅仅试图制造越来越大的激光器，还通过增加激光器来进行扩展。</p><p> Think of it as a mainframe computer breaking up into a supercomputing cluster. So, instead of just building a bigger device, we&#39;re combining in parallel. And so, what that enabled us to do is build a high-power laser that&#39;s scalable by adding modules that delivered a weapons class beam, but with very high beam qualities.</p><p> 可以将其视为分解为超级计算集群的大型计算机。因此，我们正在并行组合，而不仅仅是构建更大的设备。因此，使我们能够做的是，通过添加可提供武器级光束但光束质量非常高的模块，来构建可扩展的高功率激光器。</p><p>  I&#39;ll get to this from a laser weapon system perspective, it&#39;s more than just laser power that&#39;s important, it&#39;s the ability to focus that beam, for that beam to be able to propagate over a long distance, stay tightly focused. And of course, in the weapon system, it&#39;s important that you&#39;re able to do acquisition tracking and line of sight stabilization to keep the spot on the soft zone of the target. The fiber-laser technology is also, as I mentioned, the most efficient at converting electric power to laser light. So, all of a sudden that meant that the platform demands, whether you&#39;re on a ship, a truck, or an airplane, of being able to provide power and then cooling is minimized; it&#39;s certainly not zero, and we&#39;re talking about 30% to 35% efficiency at converting electric power into a usable laser beam. That may not sound that great to you, but compared to old solid-state laser technology, it was more like 10%.</p><p>我将从激光武器系统的角度来探讨这一点，不仅仅是重要的是激光功率，还在于聚焦光束的能力，使光束能够长距离传播并保持紧密聚焦。当然，在武器系统中，重要的是，您必须能够进行获取跟踪和稳定视线，以将斑点保持在目标的软区域上。正如我提到的，光纤激光技术也是将电能转换为激光的最有效方法。因此，突然之间，无论您是在船上，在卡车上还是在飞机上，这都意味着该平台需要能够供电并最小化冷却。它肯定不为零，我们正在谈论将电能转换为可用激光束的效率在30％到35％之间。这对您来说听起来可能并不那么好，但是与旧的固态激光技术相比，它更像是10％。</p><p>  What that meant was that the system demands, the platform demands were greatly reduced, and it meant that the laser weapon, not just the laser, the whole laser weapon, could now start being made small enough, powerful enough, to now be deployed on Army vehicles, Navy ships, and even on aircraft. So, that&#39;s really what changed the game. And as you can see, there&#39;s a lot of activity in this domain from our customers, all the services are now advancing capability in laser weapon systems for land, sea, and air. Lockheed Martin is a premier provider of this technology in all these domains, and we are working in all these domains.</p><p>  这意味着系统需求，平台需求大大减少，这意味着激光武器，不仅是激光武器，还包括整个激光武器，现在可以开始变得足够小，足够强大，可以部署到军车，海军舰船，甚至飞机上。因此，这确实改变了游戏。正如您所看到的，我们的客户在该领域有很多活动，所有服务现在都在提高陆，海，空激光武器系统的能力。洛克希德·马丁公司在所有这些领域中都是这项技术的主要提供商，我们正在所有这些领域中开展工作。</p><p> So, the kind of the key message is the final piece of the puzzle to enable the fielding of laser weapons was solved using the fiber, the beam combined—spectrally beam combined fiber laser technology. Now what we&#39;re looking at is we&#39;re moving beyond S&amp;T, Science and Technology demos... Is this even possible? We are now seeing those initial systems being built and ready to be deployed on platforms. For example, we have the program,  the HELIOS [High Energy Laser and Integrated Optical-dazzler and Surveillance] program, which is to build, integrate, and install a laser weapon system on a DDG  Arleigh Burke class destroyer.</p><p> 因此，关键信息的种类是使用光纤，光束组合（光谱组合光纤激光技术）解决激光武器部署难题的最后一步。现在我们正在寻找的是我们正在超越科技，科学和技术演示……这甚至有可能吗？现在，我们看到那些初始系统正在构建并准备在平台上进行部署。例如，我们有一个程序HELIOS（高能激光和集成的光学眩目和监视）程序，该程序可以在DDG Arleigh Burke级驱逐舰上建造，集成和安装激光武器系统。</p><p>  What&#39;s fundamental about that is it goes beyond the technology of the laser and the acquisition tracking and pointing, it&#39;s tying the laser weapon into the combat system that is on the ship. That&#39;s another area where, of course, we take great pride in being a leader in that domain. It&#39;s really that ability when you&#39;re in at the console and looking at the battlespace, being able to make decisions on what the threats are, and what&#39;s the best counter for that threat, whether it&#39;s a directed energy counter or a kinetic energy counter, and we see those capabilities operating... I don&#39;t know what&#39;s the right word... Synergistically? symbiotically? They&#39;re going to work together and provide choices and using the best option for the combatant commanders.</p><p>  根本的是，它超越了激光技术以及采集跟踪和指向功能，将激光武器与舰载战斗系统捆绑在一起。当然，这是我们在该领域的领导者感到自豪的另一个领域。当您进入控制台并查看战场时，它确实具有这种能力，能够决定威胁是什么，以及针对该威胁的最佳对策，无论是定向能量计数器还是动能计数器，我们看到这些功能正在运行...我不知道正确的词是什么？共生？他们将共同努力，为战斗指挥官提供选择和使用最佳选择。</p><p> One would imagine that if you have a large number of low-cost threats, you don&#39;t want to use high-cost, highly capable kinetic missiles against low-cost UAVs, right? You want to use your laser that has a low operating cost after the install and then you can hold your kinetics for more hardened threats that maybe the laser is inappropriate for. So, being able to provide choices, capabilities, to take on the evolving threat landscape, I think really is the value proposition that we are trying to provide our customers. So, that&#39;s kind of it in a nutshell.</p><p> 可以想象，如果您有大量的低成本威胁，就不想对付低成本无人机使用高成本，功能强大的动能导弹，对吗？您希望在安装后使用运行成本较低的激光器，然后可以控制动力学，以应对可能不适用于激光器的更严峻的威胁。因此，能够提供选择，能力来应对不断发展的威胁形势，我认为这确实是我们试图为客户提供的价值主张。因此，简而言之就是这样。</p><p>  Lockheed Martin, we&#39;ve been in this business for about 40 years, really starting with the Airborne Laser program, where Lockheed Martin was the lead on the beam control system, and it&#39;s evolved over time, where we have built capabilities in beam control, tracking, line of sight stabilization, and then platform system integration, which is really a key core competency of Lockheed Martin, right? We also build a lot of the platforms, so how you install and interface these systems with the combat systems or the control stations, and providing that interface to the user is really important.&#34;</p><p>  洛克希德·马丁（Lockheed Martin），我们从事这项业务已有40年之久，实际上是从机载激光计划开始的，当时洛克希德·马丁（Lockheed Martin）是光束控制系统的负责人，并且随着时间的发展，我们建立了光束控制功能，跟踪，视线稳定以及平台系统集成，这确实是洛克希德·马丁公司的一项关键核心能力，对吗？我们还构建了很多平台，因此，如何将这些系统与战斗系统或控制站进行安装和接口，以及向用户提供该接口确实非常重要。”</p><p> Make sure to check out the Q&amp;A portion of the interview that will be posted soon. We get into some unique topic areas where Dr. Afzal was really able to clear up a lot of misconceptions and get to the reality of what is feasible and what isn&#39;t in the near term when it comes to directed energy applications.
