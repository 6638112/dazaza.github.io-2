It was amazing how easily you could create web pages with rich content and navigate between them just like in interactive desktop apps. Let’s not talk about all those texture backgrounds along with animated gifs that no one could resist using. It was a playground and I loved it.</p><p>我在1998年买了第一台个人电脑，几年后开始尝试网页设计。你可以像在交互式桌面应用程序中一样轻松地创建内容丰富的网页并在它们之间导航，这让人惊叹不已。让我们不要谈论所有那些纹理背景以及没有人能抗拒使用的动画gif。那是个游乐场，我很喜欢。</p><p>  Microsoft Frontpage and Macromedia Dreamweaver (which was later acquired by Adobe) were the first tools I used to design and code websites just for the fun of it. At first, it was a more ‘what you see is what you get’ (WYSIWYG) approach but soon, I started playing more directly with HTML and CSS through Dreamweaver’s code editor.</p><p>微软Frontpage和Macromedia Dreamweaver(后来被Adobe收购)是我用来设计和编写网站的第一批工具，只是为了好玩。起初，这是一种更“所见即所得”(WYSIWYG)的方法，但很快，我开始通过Dreamweaver的代码编辑器更直接地使用HTML和CSS。</p><p>  A passion was born with various fun web projects being built on the side. I loved that aspect and while I was studying for my bachelor’s degree in Informatics, I got involved with all the web projects I could find. Those included web development and helped me improve my skills in those areas as well.</p><p>随着各种有趣的网络项目的建立，人们的热情也随之而生。我喜欢这个方面，在我攻读信息学学士学位的时候，我参与了我能找到的所有网络项目。其中包括网络开发，也帮助我提高了在这些领域的技能。</p><p>  The idea that I might be able to work online from my home quickly became an obsession back then. In 2009, demand for web applications was rising, so I started experimenting with dashboard templates and eventually, 3 projects were created and released in the next 3 years.</p><p>当时，我或许可以在家中在线工作的想法很快就成了一种痴迷。2009年，对Web应用程序的需求不断上升，所以我开始尝试仪表板模板，最终，在接下来的3年里创建并发布了3个项目。</p><p>  I built them in my free time while I was working with a tech company on a few web apps and studying for my master’s degree at the same time. They did just ok but a whole new world was opened in front of me.</p><p>我在与一家科技公司合作开发几个网络应用程序的同时，还在攻读硕士学位，这是我在空闲时间制作的。他们做得还不错，但是一个全新的世界在我面前打开了。</p><p>  Unfortunately, due to the various responsibilities I had at the time, I kept postponing any further action but I eventually did a dynamic comeback in 2013 when I was ready to put all my energy into designing and coding dashboard templates full-time.</p><p>不幸的是，由于我当时的各种责任，我一直在推迟任何进一步的行动，但我最终在2013年积极地卷土重来，当时我准备全职投入到仪表板模板的设计和编码上。</p><p>    You’ve heard before that you need to love your work if you would like to be successful but that’s only half the story. Loving what you do can motivate you, inspire you and make things a bit easier but that’s not necessarily enough in the long run.</p><p>你以前听说过，如果你想成功，就需要热爱你的工作，但这只是故事的一半。热爱你所做的事情可以激励你，激励你，让事情变得更容易，但从长远来看，这并不一定足够。</p><p>  I was and I am extremely passionate with UI design and coding. Back then, I used Photoshop to design each project and afterwards, I did my best to code it into HTML/CSS and make sure it works great in each major desktop and mobile browser. I used to spend so many hours testing and making sure that the result would be as perfect as possible based on my skills.</p><p>我过去是，现在也是非常热衷于UI设计和编码。那时，我用Photoshop来设计每个项目，之后，我尽最大努力把它编码成HTML/CSS，并确保它在每个主要的桌面和移动浏览器上都能很好地工作。我过去常常花很多时间进行测试，并根据我的技能确保结果尽可能完美。</p><p>  In 2013, I was able to build and release 3 more projects which were built with love and care. That’s also when the mottos “Crafted with love” and “Happy coding” came to life and follow pixelcave since then. The templates did good but unfortunately it was nothing sustainable.</p><p>2013年，我又建造并发布了3个项目，它们都是用爱和关怀建造的。这也是“用爱精心制作”和“快乐编码”的座右铭从那时起就有了生命，并遵循了Pixelcave。模板做得很好，但不幸的是，它不是可持续的。</p><p>  I loved what I was doing and felt really good designing and coding but that on its own wasn’t enough. I needed to start thinking differently because if the whole plan didn’t work out, pixelcave most probably wouldn’t exist today.</p><p>我热爱我正在做的事情，感觉自己在设计和编码方面非常不错，但光靠这一点是不够的。我需要开始以不同的方式思考，因为如果整个计划不起作用，Pixelcave很可能今天就不存在了。</p><p>    I knew that I needed to deliver value to the people using those projects and save them time, so I had to do a far better job researching their needs before even start creating the next project,  ProUI. It might seem obvious now but wasn’t the case back then.</p><p>我知道我需要为使用这些项目的人提供价值，并节省他们的时间，所以在开始创建下一个项目ProUI之前，我必须更好地研究他们的需求。现在看起来似乎很明显，但当时并非如此。</p><p>  I went through all the feedback (emails and comments) I had received from the first 3 projects and kept putting together a list of all the things people liked, struggled with, or wish they had. A few things on the list kept coming back, so I knew that those were crucial, and I had to prioritize them.</p><p>我看了从前3个项目收到的所有反馈(电子邮件和评论)，并不断地把人们喜欢的、挣扎的或希望他们拥有的东西列在一个清单上。清单上的一些事情不断地出现，所以我知道这些事情是至关重要的，我必须对它们进行优先排序。</p><p>  Next up, I researched public feedback regarding similar projects and got a feeling of what didn’t work and the problems most of the people were having when using such products. There were many issues that also kept coming back, so I’ve already had a good list of features and solutions that I had to work on ProUI.</p><p>接下来，我研究了公众对类似项目的反馈，了解了哪些项目不起作用，以及大多数人在使用这类产品时遇到的问题。有很多问题也不断地出现，所以我已经有了一个很好的列表，列出了我必须在ProUI上工作的功能和解决方案。</p><p>  What kept me researching for a while was the feeling that creating another project in the same way, would give me the same mediocre results. You can’t expect to have a different outcome when doing the same things repeatedly. I’m glad I’ve followed that path before getting my hands dirty and start coding the new template.</p><p>让我研究了一段时间的是这样一种感觉，即以同样的方式创建另一个项目，会给我带来同样平庸的结果。当重复做同样的事情时，你不能期望会有不同的结果。我很高兴在动手并开始编写新模板之前已经遵循了这条道路。</p><p>    This project was everything back then because its success or failure would completely change my life. If it didn’t work, it was the end of my working from home career and I had to completely change my approach and start looking for alternatives. There was no money or time to waste and for my mind, it was a matter of survival, I wanted it to succeed so much.</p><p>这个项目是当时的一切，因为它的成败将彻底改变我的生活。如果它不起作用，我在家工作的职业生涯就结束了，我不得不彻底改变我的方法，开始寻找替代方案。没有钱和时间可以浪费，对我来说，这是一个生存的问题，我非常希望它能成功。</p><p>  That was the perfect timing and the pressure helped me take it very seriously. I tried to be positive and passionate about the result and kept working day and night towards making a great product. It’s funny how pressure can help or harm your work. I have experienced both outcomes in the past but thankfully it was one of the things that pushed me forward, helped me overcome my fears and boosted my creativity. ProUI was live and the pressure had delivered. Sales started coming in, a new world appeared in front of my eyes and I knew that nothing was going to be the same again.</p><p>这是一个完美的时机，压力让我非常认真地对待这件事。我试着对结果保持积极和热情，并日以继夜地工作，以制造出一款伟大的产品。有趣的是，压力能帮助或损害你的工作。我在过去经历过这两种结果，但值得庆幸的是，这是推动我前进的事情之一，帮助我克服了恐惧，增强了我的创造力。ProUI是现场直播的，压力已经传递。销售开始了，一个新的世界出现在我眼前，我知道一切都不会再是原来的样子了。</p><p>    ProUI was designed and coded from scratch by hand. In contrary to the way other products were created by only using readymade layouts, navigation elements and other major building blocks, ProUI foundation was based on a solid structure built exclusively for it. I think that’s what gave it an identity in the first place and helped it in the long run.</p><p>ProUI是由手工从头开始设计和编码的。与仅使用现成的布局、导航元素和其他主要构建块创建其他产品的方式相反，ProUI Foundation基于专门为其构建的坚实结构。我认为这就是它最初的身份，并从长远来看对它有帮助的。</p><p>  I did my best to implement many popular features, provide solutions to issues people were experiencing, make a template that is straightforward, easy to use and most importantly that works as advertised. When inspiration hit, personal design touches were applied to make the design original and give it the feeling of a fresh experience.</p><p>我尽最大努力实现了许多流行的功能，为人们遇到的问题提供了解决方案，制作了一个简单、易于使用的模板，最重要的是，它的工作方式与广告宣传的一样。当灵感袭来时，运用个性化的设计手法，使设计独具匠心，给人以新鲜体验的感觉。</p><p>    Testing was one of the main features of ProUI and continue being for all current projects. It might be simpler now with most popular browsers being chromium-based but that wasn’t the case back in the days. Internet Explorer 8 was the baseline and the newly introduced popularity of mobile browsers with their own set of issues wasn’t making things any better.</p><p>测试是ProUI的主要功能之一，并且继续适用于所有当前项目。现在可能更简单了，因为大多数流行的浏览器都是基于铬的，但在过去情况并非如此。Internet Explorer8是基准，新推出的手机浏览器的受欢迎程度以及它们自己的一系列问题并没有让事情变得更好。</p><p>  Responsive design was in its glory days and started becoming mainstream back in 2013 but testing tools weren’t on par yet. I still remembered resizing the browser like 1000 times each day to ensure that all content would appear as supposed to from mobile screens up to desktop monitors.</p><p>响应式设计正处于鼎盛时期，早在2013年就开始成为主流，但测试工具还不能与之匹敌。我仍然记得每天调整浏览器的大小大约1000次，以确保从移动屏幕到桌面显示器的所有内容都能按预期显示。</p><p>  Testing on devices was also a big issue because I only had access to 2 older smartphones. New devices kept releasing at the time with various browsers popping up, so my solution was to visit stores for testing on their promo devices! I uploaded versions of the work-in-progress template to the demo server and tested it against various devices, from Macbooks to iPhones, iPads, and latest Android devices.</p><p>在设备上测试也是一个大问题，因为我只能使用两部较旧的智能手机。当时新设备不断发布，各种浏览器如雨后春笋般涌现，所以我的解决方案是去商店测试他们的促销设备！我将正在进行的模板的版本上传到演示服务器，并在各种设备上对其进行测试，从Macbook到iPhone、iPad和最新的Android设备。</p><p>  One of the main issues people were experiencing at the time was the poor mobile performance, so I was determined to make ProUI as fast and responsive as possible. During my visits, I kept notes and tried to fix the bugs when I got back home on the fly hoping that they will work. Of course, that wasn’t always the case, so visiting the stores became part of my weekly work schedule! I switched stores occasionally, so it doesn’t get too awkward...</p><p>当时人们遇到的主要问题之一是移动性能不佳，所以我决定让ProUI尽可能快速和灵敏。在我访问期间，我做了笔记，当我匆忙回到家时，我试图修复这些错误，希望它们能起作用。当然，情况并不总是这样，所以逛商店成了我每周工作计划的一部分。我偶尔换店，所以不会太尴尬...。</p><p>  Thankfully, the effort fulfilled its purpose and ProUI was released in a good stable state. I kept visiting the stores for a few months though (before I was able to get my hands on my own testing devices) to handle any reported bugs. My goal was to always reply in less than 24hrs during business days to support requests (something that I still do), so there were days of me rushing through stores to handle the situation. I tried to keep it cool with my responses despite the store situation (how professional is to test against demo devices in a store?) but in the end, I want to believe that the effort and care I gave, really paid off and helped ProUI be as bug free as possible.</p><p>值得庆幸的是，这一努力达到了它的目的，ProUI在一个良好的稳定状态下发布了。不过，我连续几个月访问商店(在我能够拿到我自己的测试设备之前)，以处理任何报告的错误。我的目标是在工作日总是在24小时内回复，以支持请求(我现在仍然在做这件事)，所以有几天我会在商店里匆忙处理这种情况。我试着对我的回答保持冷静，不管商店的情况如何(在商店里测试演示设备有多专业？)。但最终，我愿意相信我付出的努力和关心，真的得到了回报，并帮助ProUI尽可能地没有bug。</p><p>    I learned that you must keep a balance between the features you want to implement in your project and the time it takes you to do it. It’s far better to integrate less and put your project out there sooner than trying to make it as complete as possible.</p><p>我了解到，您必须在想要在项目中实现的功能和执行该功能所需的时间之间保持平衡。与其试图使项目尽可能完整，不如减少集成并尽早将项目发布出去。</p><p>  While building ProUI, bills kept coming in, which in the end I think helped me because I had to put it out there as quickly as possible. That might not made it the perfect release I might had in my mind but in the end, ProUI provided value and helped people in their projects.</p><p>在构建ProUI的同时，账单不断涌入，我认为这最终对我有帮助，因为我必须尽快把它放在那里。这可能不会使它成为我脑海中的完美版本，但最终，ProUI提供了价值，并在他们的项目中帮助了人们。</p><p>    This is important and seems to apply in everything I do. As you learn more about your product’s market or about the tech you are using, it gets harder and harder to put something out there. You analyze everything way too much and easily spot the things that might go, or you do wrong.</p><p>这一点很重要，似乎也适用于我做的每一件事。随着你对你的产品的市场或你正在使用的技术有了更多的了解，你就会越来越难把东西推向市场。你分析每件事的方式都太多了，很容易发现可能发生的事情，或者你做错了。</p><p>  There was this guy, who started selling WordPress plugins without knowing much about the market but focused on creating great products. After managing to reach 1 million in sales, he stated that if he knew the things he discovered afterwards, he would probably have never started selling WordPress plugins in the first place because it would be too difficult for him.</p><p>有这样一个人，他开始销售WordPress插件，对市场了解不多，但专注于创造伟大的产品。在设法达到100万的销售额后，他表示，如果他知道后来发现的事情，他很可能一开始就不会开始销售WordPress插件，因为这对他来说太难了。</p><p>  It was early days, and this is how I felt when I was building ProUI. It was liberating not analyzing what works and what doesn’t and focus on the product itself. Since then, I try to keep a balance between the things I discover and the things I want to experiment with when working on something. It’s exactly like the designer who redesigns his website and before he even finishes, he already finds the new design awful. Don’t be like that, try to fight back!</p><p>当时还处于早期阶段，这就是我在构建ProUI时的感受。这是一种解放，不是分析什么起作用，什么不起作用，而是专注于产品本身。从那时起，我试着在我发现的东西和我想做实验的东西之间保持平衡。这就像重新设计他的网站的设计师，甚至在他完成之前，他就已经发现新的设计很糟糕。别这样，试着还手吧！</p><p>    I would describe myself as perfectionist, but I try not to. Thankfully, the characterization does not apply, most of the time. When you are aiming for perfection, the only one you satisfy is yourself. You set the bar of perfection based on the level of your skills. You might spend 2 months to create something you would describe as perfect to only have someone with better skills identify all the things you didn’t do good enough.</p><p>我会说自己是完美主义者，但我尽量不这么说。值得庆幸的是，在大多数情况下，这种描述并不适用。当你追求完美时，你唯一能满足的就是你自己。你可以根据你的技能水平来设定完美的标准。你可能会花2个月的时间去创造一些你会形容为完美的东西，只让一个技能更好的人来识别你做得不够好的所有事情。</p><p>  Having said that, it’s a better approach to constantly try improving your skills and aiming for something below perfection. This way, you will get a much better outcome in the end. You must keep improving yourself and understand that nothing is going to ever be perfect.</p><p>话虽如此，但更好的方法是不断努力提高你的技能，并将目标定在不完美的地方。这样，你最终会得到一个好得多的结果。你必须不断提高自己，明白没有什么是十全十美的。</p><p>  Perfection is subjective and related to your skills and time. Something ‘perfect’ today, won’t be perfect in a couple of years. Keep aiming for creating great experiences and products using the most of your current skills and try to keep learning throughout your life.</p><p>完美是主观的，与你的技能和时间有关。今天‘完美’的东西，几年后就不会完美了。保持目标，利用你目前的技能创造更好的体验和产品，并努力在你的一生中不断学习。</p><p>    After ProUI release, I kept updating and supporting the project for a long time. Especially in its early days, the new updates, bringing improvements and new features, were released very often in my attempt to make the project as complete as possible.</p><p>在ProUI发布之后，我在很长一段时间里一直在更新和支持这个项目。特别是在它的早期，新的更新带来了改进和新的功能，我经常发布这些更新，试图让项目尽可能完整。</p><p>  From my understanding, it seems that the continuous updates provided credibility and made people trust the project. They felt confidence purchasing a license for their project because they knew that ProUI would be supported and updated for a long time.</p><p>根据我的理解，似乎不断的更新提供了可信度，并使人们对该项目产生了信任。他们有信心为他们的项目购买许可证，因为他们知道ProUI将在很长一段时间内得到支持和更新。</p><p>  That’s something I kept doing with all projects since then because I strongly believe that updating and supporting a project is one of its strongest features. Usually, most of similar projects are abandoned way too soon even if their creators heavily advertise about lifelong updates.</p><p>从那时起，我一直在对所有项目做这件事，因为我坚信更新和支持项目是它最强大的功能之一。通常情况下，大多数类似的项目都会过早地被放弃，即使它们的创建者大肆宣传终身更新。</p><p>    It’s always great to implement features or changes people want and I did my best to fulfill most of the suggestions I received. Customers seemed to be pleased and the added features helped bring even more on board. Later, I discovered that you must keep a balance as your user base becomes larger, though.</p><p>实现人们想要的功能或更改总是很棒的，我尽了最大努力满足我收到的大多数建议。客户似乎很满意，添加的功能帮助带来了更多的支持。不过，后来我发现，随着用户群变得越来越大，你必须保持平衡。</p><p>  I understood that I must better evaluate the suggested changes or additions and make sure that all existing customers aren’t affected in a big way. For example, let’s say you find something that can be easily improved but this improvement would make over 1000 projects a pain to be updated. You would have to consider it twice on how to approach this situation.</p><p>我明白，我必须更好地评估建议的更改或增加，并确保所有现有客户都不会受到很大影响。例如，假设您发现了一些可以轻松改进的内容，但是这种改进将使1000多个项目成为更新的痛苦。对于如何处理这种情况，你必须三思而后行。</p><p>  Also, let’s consider a suggested feature that it’s quite easy to implement. That does not necessarily mean that it will because by adding it, you will have to make sure that you are able to  Maintain,  Update, and  Support it afterwards, something that many people don’t think about. I call it the  MUS and I take it into heavy consideration whenever a new feature is added.</p><p>另外，让我们考虑一个建议的功能，它非常容易实现。这并不一定意味着它会，因为通过添加它，您必须确保能够在之后维护、更新和支持它，这是许多人没有考虑到的。我称它为MU，每当添加新功能时，我都会认真考虑。</p><p>  For example, when I added a Laravel Starter Kit to  Dashmix, support requests started rising because there were people not knowing about Laravel but wanted to use it for the first time. Or in a similar way for  OneUI, when the Vue.js version was included as a free update to the package.</p><p>例如，当我在DashMix中添加了Laravel初学者工具包时，支持请求开始增加，因为有些人不知道Laravel，但却想第一次使用它。或者以类似的方式用于OneUI，即Vue.js版本作为软件包的免费更新包括在内。</p><p>  The  MUS helps me evaluate what is going to be included, make sure that I’m able to handle the volume of support requests and find a great balance between maintaining multiple existing projects and working in new ones. Regarding ProUI, I believe that if I kept adding anything requested, I might not have been able to keep it in the good state I was aiming for in the long run.</p><p>MU帮助我评估将要包含的内容，确保我能够处理大量的支持请求，并在维护多个现有项目和处理新项目之间找到很好的平衡。关于ProUI，我相信如果我不断添加任何要求的内容，从长远来看，我可能无法将其保持在我想要的良好状态。</p><p>    I still remember the first time a customer sent me an email with a screencast attached showcasing the issue he was having. Hearing his voice, explaining the situation put him in front of me.  Most of the emails received till then felt so impersonal, but this one helped me improve how I approached support in general.</p><p>我还记得一位客户第一次给我发来一封电子邮件，并附上了一段截屏视频，展示了他遇到的问题。听到他的声音，解释情况，把他放在我面前。在此之前收到的大多数电子邮件都感觉非常客观，但这一封帮助我改善了总体上接触支持的方式。</p><p>  I always try to do my best and respond to each request just like I would if that person were in front of me. Being friendly, professional, helpful, and kind is all that it takes to provide a great support experience both for you and your customers. Happy customers make you happy and that helps you work better.</p><p>我总是尽力做到最好，回应每一个请求，就像那个人在我面前时我会做的那样。友好、专业、乐于助人、和蔼可亲是为您和您的客户提供出色支持体验所需的全部条件。快乐的客户会让你快乐，这会帮助你更好地工作。</p><p>  I believe that giving great support was an especially important ingredient for ProUI’s success. Moreover, providing a detailed, up to the point and constantly updated documentation is helpful both for the customers and me because it brings down the volume of support requests. Standing by your projects and customers can only bring positive outcomes for everyone.</p><p>我相信给予巨大的支持是ProUI成功的一个特别重要的因素。此外，提供详细的、最新的、不断更新的文档对客户和我都很有帮助，因为它减少了支持请求量。坚持你的项目和客户只会给每个人带来积极的结果。</p><p>    I’m incredibly grateful for all the support the project has received and that all the hard work put into good use. I also feel so grateful for the constant emotional and motivational support I kept receiving from my spouse who was always there to encourage me in every way she could. I can’t imagine how harder could it be to have family or friends question your actions without being supportive, especially when you try to build a business which does not seem to be working at first.</p><p>我非常感谢这个项目得到的所有支持，所有的辛勤工作都得到了很好的利用。我也非常感谢我的配偶不断给予我情感上和动机上的支持，他总是在那里尽她所能地鼓励我。我无法想象在没有支持的情况下让家人或朋友质疑你的行为会有多难，特别是当你试图建立一家一开始似乎并不奏效的企业时。</p><p>  ProUI surpassed $90,000 in total license sales throughout its lifetime but more importantly it helped make the work sustainable and enabled me and my spouse work fulltime on pixelcave. Nowadays, we work together on building and supporting projects that can help people build their products and businesses.</p><p>ProUI在其整个生命周期中的许可销售总额超过了9万美元，但更重要的是，它帮助使这项工作具有可持续性，并使我和我的配偶能够全职从事Pixelcave的工作。如今，我们共同致力于建设和支持能够帮助人们建立产品和业务的项目。</p><p>  Being thankful and grateful is crucial, helps you appreciate what you already have and provides the foundation you need to keep going. Learning and building new skills comes next. You must keep learning and applying the new knowledge into your work. Things, especially in tech, change so fast that it’s vital to do your best to keep offering products that provide value and solutions.</p><p>感恩和感恩是至关重要的，它会帮助你珍惜你已经拥有的东西，并为你继续前进提供基础。接下来是学习和建立新技能。你必须不断学习新知识，并将其运用到你的工作中。事情，特别是在科技领域，变化如此之快，所以尽最大努力继续提供提供价值和解决方案的产品是至关重要的。</p><p>  Finally, I find that it’s important to iterate by going back to older projects and refactoring them based on the skills you’ve acquired when it is sustainable. For example,  OneUI was completely redesigned and built from scratch after a few years of its release, making all existing customers happy and bringing over new ones.</p><p>最后，我发现通过回到较旧的项目并基于您在可持续时获得的技能对其进行重构进行迭代是很重要的。例如，OneUI在发布几年后完全重新设计和构建，让所有现有客户都满意，并带来了新的客户。</p><p>    ProUI started something amazing since it enabled us to work from wherever we want based on our own schedule. We love to travel and work, so that was the first important step towards that goal. Since then, we created five more projects from which three of them are actively supported.</p><p>ProUI开始了一些令人惊叹的事情，因为它使我们能够根据自己的时间表在任何我们想要的地方工作。我们喜欢旅行和工作，所以这是朝着这个目标迈出的重要的第一步。从那时起，我们又创建了五个项目，其中三个项目得到了积极的支持。</p><p>  Currently, the main work focus is on two completely new projects which are based on TailwindCSS and Bootstrap 5, respectively. The first one is Tailkit and the second is an unannounced one with more info coming.</p><p>目前，主要工作集中在两个全新的项目上，这两个项目分别基于Tailwind CSS和Bootstrap5。第一个是Tailkit，第二个是未公布的，即将发布更多信息。</p><p>  I’ve already shared and will continue to lots of sneak peeks for Tailkit at my  personal Twitter account as I work on it ( Tailkit is already released!). I’ve recently decided to start using it to be able to share more insights and tips into the work I do, so feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to say hi!</p><p>我已经分享了很多Tailkit，并将继续在我的个人Twitter账户上偷看它(Tailkit已经发布了！)。我最近决定开始使用它，以便能够分享更多关于我所做工作的见解和技巧，所以如果你有任何问题或想打个招呼，请随时联系！</p><p>    Have I figured out what people need from the project I’m working on?</p><p>我知道人们需要从我正在做的项目中得到什么了吗？</p><p>  Have I set a timeline to make sure that the first release won’t take that long to happen?</p><p>我有没有设定一个时间表，以确保第一次发布不会花那么长时间？</p><p>    Have I tested the product enough to make sure it’s in a good and stable state?</p><p>我是否对产品进行了足够的测试，以确保其处于良好和稳定的状态？</p><p>    Is my focus on creating a project which provides value, or my goal is only to sell and profit?</p><p>我的重点是创建一个提供价值的项目，还是我的目标只是销售和盈利？</p><p>    Would you like to let you know about any new posts?
