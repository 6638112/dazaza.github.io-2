The guidelines, citing the medical privacy law known as HIPAA, suggested a nearly impossible standard: Before letting journalists inside Covid-19 wards, hospitals needed prior permission from not only the specific patients the journalists would interview, but also other patients whose names or identities would be accessible.</p><p>当Covid-19春季袭击美国时，特朗普政府的一名高级官员悄悄地加强了一套指导方针，以防止记者进入大流行一线的少数几家医院。该指南引用了被称为HIPAA的医疗隐私法，提出了几乎不可能的标准：在让记者进入Covid-19病房之前，医院不仅需要事先获得记者采访的特定患者的许可，还需要获得其姓名或身份的其他患者的事先许可。将可访问。</p><p> The onerous guidelines were issued on May 5 by Roger Severino, who worked at the conservative Heritage Foundation before Donald Trump appointed him to direct the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. The guidelines made it extremely difficult for hospitals to give photographers the opportunity to collect visual evidence of the pandemic’s severity. By tightening the circulation of disturbing images, the guidelines fulfilled, intentionally or not, a key Trump administration goal: keeping public attention away from the death toll, which has surpassed 300,000 souls.</p><p> 繁琐的指导方针是由罗杰·塞韦里诺（Roger Severino）于5月5日发布的，他在保守派遗产基金会工作，之后唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）指定他在卫生与公共服务部（HHS）指导民权办公室。该指南使医院极难为摄影师提供机会来收集大流行病严重程度的视觉证据。通过收紧令人不安的影像的传播，该准则有意或无意地实现了特朗普政府的一项关键目标：使公众的注意力远离造成30万人丧生的死亡人数。</p><p> “The last thing hospital patients need to worry about during the Covid-19 crisis is a film crew walking around their bed shooting B-roll,” Severino said dismissively in a short press release accompanying the guidelines.</p><p> “在Covid-19危机期间，医院患者需要担心的最后一件事是，摄制组在床旁走动，拍摄B胶卷，” Severino在与指导方针一起发布的简短新闻中不屑一顾地说道。</p><p>  In the pandemic’s early days, when hospitals were first inundated with media requests, the prevailing HIPAA guidelines were quite restrictive, even on matters that had nothing to do with media access. Those guidelines predated the Trump administration and were not written for a pandemic. But the scale of the Covid-19 crisis quickly forced the Trump administration to loosen a wide range of privacy restrictions on medical providers — except, as it turned out, the ones that kept Americans from viscerally seeing the ailing and the dying.</p><p>  在大流行的初期，医院第一次被媒体要求淹没，当时的HIPAA准则非常严格，即使在与媒体访问无关的问题上也是如此。这些指导方针早于特朗普政府之前，并未写成大流行病。但是，Covid-19危机的规模迅速迫使特朗普政府放松了对医疗服务提供者的广泛隐私限制-事实证明，除了那些使美国人无法明显看到患病和垂死之辈的隐私限制。</p><p> For instance, HHS allowed hospitals to  share Covid-19 information with first responders and with  organizations involved in Covid-19 testing. Hospitals were told that they would not face sanctions for  sharing information with the families or friends of Covid-19 patients. Doctors were freed to discuss or transfer patient information with  technologies that were not secure, such as email, FaceTime, and Skype. As it relaxed these restrictions, the agency said that medical providers would  not be punished for breaches of patient confidentiality if they acted in good faith during the pandemic.</p><p> 例如，HHS允许医院与急救人员以及参与Covid-19测试的组织共享Covid-19信息。医院被告知，与Covid-19患者的家人或朋友共享信息不会受到制裁。医生可以使用电子邮件，FaceTime和Skype等不安全的技术来讨论或传输患者信息。该机构表示，在放宽这些限制的同时，如果医疗服务提供者在大流行期间表现出诚意，也不会因违反患者保密规定而受到惩罚。</p><p>  The government’s permissiveness did not extend to journalists. The media guidelines announced by Severino in May reinforced HIPAA’s restrictions and warned hospitals that violations could bring fines in the millions of dollars. The announcement was not reported by general-interest publications, but news outlets for the health care industry  noticed what had happened. The headline of  one of those industry stories was blunt: “Patient Privacy Prevails Over Covid-19 Media Coverage.”</p><p>  政府的宽容并未扩大到记者。 Severino在5月份宣布的媒体指南加强了HIPAA的限制，并警告医院，违规行为可能导致数百万美元的罚款。这项公告没有得到大众关注的出版物的报道，但是医疗行业的新闻媒体注意到了发生了什么。这些行业故事之一的标题直言不讳：“患者隐私普遍存在于Covid-19媒体报道中。”</p><p> Severino’s guidance, little known outside the health care industry, may help solve one of the mysteries of the pandemic: Why have Americans seen relatively little imagery of people suffering from Covid-19? While there is a long-running debate over the influence of disturbing images of death and dying — whether they actually move public opinion — the relative paucity of videos and photographs of the pandemic’s victims might help explain why Covid-19 skepticism has thrived as the death toll in America reaches the level of a 9/11 every day.</p><p> Severino的指导在医疗保健行业以外鲜为人知，这可能有助于解决这一大流行的奥秘之一：为什么美国人对Covid-19病人的印象相对较少？虽然关于令人不安的死亡和垂死图像的影响（是否确实在引起公众舆论）的争论长期存在，但有关流行病受害者的视频和照片相对匮乏可能有助于解释为什么Covid-19怀疑论随着死亡而蓬勃发展美国的收费每天达到9/11的水平。 </p><p> “For society to respond in ways commensurate with the importance of this pandemic, we have to see it,”  wrote art historian Sarah Elizabeth Lewis. “For us to be transformed by it, it has to penetrate our hearts as well as our minds. Images force us to contend with the unspeakable. They help humanize clinical statistics, to make them comprehensible.”</p><p>艺术史学家莎拉·伊丽莎白·刘易斯（Sarah Elizabeth Elizabeth Lewis）写道：“要让社会以与这种流行病的重要性相称的方式做出反应，我们必须看到它。” “要让我们被它改变，它必须渗透我们的内心和思想。图像迫使我们应对难以言表的挑战。它们有助于人性化临床统计数据，使其易于理解。”</p><p>  From the moment Covid-19 took hold, journalists in the United States experienced immense difficulty getting access to what amounts to ground zero of the emergency. This was not because they were not trying — they deluged hospitals with requests to document what was happening. Nor was it because doctors and nurses resisted — they clamored for more attention to the agonies endured by their patients. With infrequent exceptions, hospitals said no to the requests from journalists, often without explanation.</p><p>  从Covid-19举行的那一刻起，美国的记者遇到了巨大的困难，难以获得等于零的紧急事件。这不是因为他们没有尝试-他们使医院陷入沉迷，要求记录正在发生的事情。这也不是因为医生和护士抗拒-他们大声疾呼要求更多地注意患者承受的痛苦。除了极少数例外，医院对记者的要求不予理,，而且往往没有解释。</p><p> Lucas Jackson, a senior photographer for Reuters, recalls that at the start of the pandemic in March, he worked with a team at Reuters that called nearly every hospital and trauma ward in New York City. They created a spreadsheet of the hospitals and whether they had been contacted and what their response was. Only a few responded, and none granted access, even though Reuters offered Guantánamo levels of control to hospital staff, agreeing to get releases from patients and allowing hospital staff to look at all photographs to make sure no names or identities were disclosed. “If that’s what it takes, we were willing to do it,” Jackson told The Intercept.</p><p> 路透社资深摄影师卢卡斯·杰克逊（Lucas Jackson）回忆说，三月大流行开始时，他曾在路透社的一个团队工作，该团队几乎召集了纽约市的所有医院和创伤病房。他们创建了一份电子表格，列出了医院以及是否已经联系过医院以及他们的反应是什么。尽管路透社向关塔那摩提供了对医院工作人员一定程度的控制，但只有少数人做出了回应，但没有人允许访问，他们同意从患者那里获得释放，并允许医院工作人员查看所有照片，以确保没有透露姓名或身份。杰克逊（Jackson）告诉The Intercept：“如果那样做，我们愿意这么做。”</p><p>  Michael Kamber, a former war photographer who directs the Bronx Documentary Center in New York City, recalls security guards shooing him off the sidewalks in front of Lincoln Medical Center. “This is the greatest loss of life on the American continent in such a concentrated time, and we’re seeing almost no images that really convey the devastation and the death,” Kamber said. “Photography has played such a key role in the civil rights movement, in ending the Vietnam War, and any number of key moments in American history — and it just seems missing in action on this crisis.”</p><p>  迈克尔·坎伯（Michael Kamber）是前战争摄影师，负责指挥纽约市布朗克斯纪录片中心，他回忆起保安人员将他赶出林肯医学中心前的人行道。坎伯说：“在如此集中的时间里，这是美国大陆上最大的生命损失，而且我们几乎看不到任何能真正传达出毁灭和死亡的图像。” “摄影在民权运动，结束越南战争以及美国历史上许多关键时刻中发挥了如此关键的作用，而在这场危机中的行动似乎不存在。”</p><p> Kamber, like other photographers, accepts that safety and privacy concerns need to be upheld, but he believes that those concerns are used as excuses for the repression of journalism that is manifestly in the public interest. In the cases in which hospitals have allowed journalists inside during the pandemic, there have been no privacy breaches — which proves that reporters can work at the medical front line without violating patient privacy. “The government and nearly all health care facilities have banded together in the name of protecting the privacy of the sick and have done an excellent job of keeping photographers as far away from the grief and devastation as possible,” Kamber said.</p><p> 坎伯像其他摄影师一样，也接受安全和隐私方面的关注，但他认为这些关注被用作压制新闻的借口，这显然是出于公共利益。在大流行期间医院允许记者进入内部的情况下，没有发生隐私泄露事件。这证明了记者可以在医疗前线工作而不会侵犯患者隐私。坎伯说：“政府和几乎所有的医疗机构都以保护病人的隐私为名，团结了起来，并做了出色的工作，使摄影师尽可能远离痛苦和灾难。”</p><p> There have been exceptions, of course. John Moore, an award-winning photographer for Getty Images, got inside a Connecticut hospital in the early days of the pandemic. A contact with connections to the hospital vouched for Moore, removing the obstacles that were keeping others out. Even so, Moore had just one visit to the intensive care unit, working in a hurry with a communications official carrying a stack of releases that everyone he came into contact with had to sign. Moore did not take pictures of patients’ faces. “We established ground rules ahead of time, and I stuck to those,” he said.</p><p> 当然也有例外。盖蒂图片社获奖摄影师约翰·摩尔在大流行初期进入康涅狄格州一家医院。与医院连接的联系证明摩尔，消除了阻碍其他人前进的障碍。即便如此，穆尔也只拜访了重症监护病房，急忙与一位通讯官员一起工作，他拿着一堆释放品，他所接触的每个人都必须签署。摩尔没有为病人的脸拍照。他说：“我们提前建立了基本规则，而我坚持这些规则。”</p><p> Getty Images is a major photo agency that has worked hard to get its photographers into hospitals, with only rare success. “For every thousand calls or emails, you maybe get three yeses,” said Sandy Ciric, the agency’s director of photography. “Sometimes we even had the CEO say, ‘This is great, yes, we want coverage,’ and then someone tells them no and they change their mind.”</p><p> 盖蒂图片社（Getty Images）是一家主要的摄影社，它一直在努力地将其摄影师送入医院，但收效甚微。该机构摄影总监桑迪·西里克（Sandy Ciric）说：“每千个电话或电子邮件，您可能会得到三个肯定。” “有时候我们甚至让首席执行官说，‘这太好了，是的，我们想要报道。’然后有人告诉他们不，他们改变了主意。” </p><p> The exceptions demonstrate that not all the blame can be placed on the government. There is enough wiggle room in the regulations for determined hospitals to let journalists inside and trust them to follow the rules. Journalists who spoke with The Intercept noted a similarity to embeds with the U.S. military: Just as embedded war reporters were privy to sensitive information that they were trusted to keep to themselves, journalists in hospitals can be counted on to not publish patient information that they are not supposed to publish.</p><p>例外情况表明，并不是所有的责任都可以归咎于政府。法规中有足够的回旋余地，供坚定的医院允许记者进入并信任他们遵守规则。与《拦截》杂志进行采访的记者指出，他们与美国军方的嵌入有相似之处：正如嵌入式战争的记者对被信任保留给自己的敏感信息一无所知，可以指望医院的记者不要发布他们是不应该发布。</p><p> A photographer who got access to several hospitals in the early months of the pandemic expressed quiet fury that most medical facilities in the country chose to keep their doors closed. “I was not happy that I had a scoop,” said the photographer, who asked that their name not be used in order to protect their ability and their employer’s ability to continue to work inside hospitals. “I was not happy that I had exclusive access. I felt that all my colleagues should have had the same access I had. … The dearth of images of death and dying directly contributed to the disinformation [about Covid-19] and the ongoing disbelief in our country, full stop. And the hospitals have to answer for that. The hospitals bear some responsibility.”</p><p> 在大流行的最初几个月里进入几家医院的一位摄影师表现出平静的愤怒，该国大多数医疗机构都选择保持门关闭。摄影师说：“我对我有独家新闻感到不高兴。”摄影师要求不要使用他们的名字来保护他们的能力和雇主继续在医院工作的能力。 “我对拥有独家访问权感到不满意。我觉得我所有的同事都应该拥有与我相同的访问权限。 ……缺乏死亡和垂死的图像直接导致了关于[Covid-19]的虚假信息以及我们国家的持续怀疑，这是完全的停顿。医院必须为此做出回应。医院承担一些责任。”</p><p>  The war metaphor sheds light on why 300,000 coronavirus deaths have elicited a shallower national response than the loss of life in previous catastrophes. Domestic opposition to the war in Vietnam was shaped by imagery of U.S. soldiers as well as Vietnamese civilians in agonizing moments of injury or death. Americans were horrified to see the true face of war. Having learned its lesson, the U.S. government suppressed imagery of American casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan: The embed program aimed at preventing journalists from roaming around battlefields on their own, taking pictures of whatever they wanted.</p><p>  战争的隐喻揭示了为什么300,000例冠状病毒死亡引起的国家反应比以前灾难中生命的丧失要浅。美国士兵和越南平民在伤亡惨痛时刻的形象塑造了对越南战争的国内反对。美国人看到战争的真实面目感到震惊。吸取教训后，美国政府压制了美国在伊拉克和阿富汗的人员伤亡的图像：该嵌入程序旨在防止记者独自漫游战场，为想要的东西拍照。</p><p> Eerily, the embed  guidelines used by the Pentagon included a prior-consent clause similar to what HIPAA, or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, demands. The guidelines prohibited war journalists from publishing pictures or videos of wounded soldiers unless they had prior written permission from the soldiers (a practical impossibility on the battlefield): “Names, video, identifiable written/oral descriptions or identifiable photographs of wounded service members will not be released without service member’s prior written consent.” The guidelines also enforced a ban on photography of the dead: “Images clearly identifying individuals ‘killed in action’ will not be released.”</p><p> 奇怪的是，五角大楼使用的嵌入准则包括与HIPAA或《健康保险流通与责任法案》所要求的类似的事先同意条款。该准则禁止战争新闻工作者发布受伤士兵的照片或录像，除非事先获得士兵的书面许可（在战场上实际上是不可能的）：“受伤士兵的姓名，视频，可识别的书面/口头描述或可识别照片不会未经服务成员事先书面同意即被释放。”该准则还禁止拍摄死者的照片：“将不会清楚地表明被'杀害为行动者'的图像。”</p><p> The unifying principle between repressing photography of a war and photography of a pandemic is that a population that cannot see human carnage will not object as strongly to its perpetuation and will not care as much about the incompetence that brought it on. Hospitals and nursing homes may not have the mendacious intent of the U.S. military, but their actions have a similar effect of making it nearly impossible for ordinary Americans to be confronted with visual evidence of the true cost of the calamity that’s unfolding.</p><p> 压制战争摄影和大流行摄影之间的统一原则是，看不见人类屠杀的人们不会强烈反对其屠杀，也不会太在意造成屠杀的无能。医院和疗养院可能没有美军的野蛮意图，但是它们的行动具有类似的效果，使普通美国人几乎不可能面对正在发生的灾难的真实代价的视觉证据。</p><p> The Intercept reached out to a number of hospitals to ask about their media polices, including Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, Mount Sinai in New York City, and Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. The only one that responded was Massachusetts General in Boston, which provided the following statement:</p><p> 侦听器与许多医院进行了联系，询问其媒体政策，包括洛杉矶的Cedars-Sinai，纽约市的西奈山和华盛顿特区的乔治城大学。唯一回应的是波士顿的麻萨诸塞州将军。提供了以下声明：</p><p> MGH has been restricting outside photographers from working in areas of the hospital where staff care for COVID patients. This is for both for the privacy of our patients and also their safety and that of our staff. Throughout the pandemic, the hospital has taken careful steps to minimize the amount of people coming to campus to ensure that only those essential for patient care and hospital operations are working in the building. While we recognize the importance of telling the story of how this pandemic has affected our patients and staff, our top priorities must always be privacy and safety. Our team has taken additional steps to make our experts, caregivers and consenting patients available to journalists remotely, as well as images and videos captured by our staff photographers.</p><p> MGH一直禁止外部摄影师在医院中为COVID患者提供护理的区域工作。这不仅是为了保护我们患者的隐私，也为了他们和我们员工的安全。在整个大流行中，医院已采取了谨慎的步骤，以尽量减少来校园的人数，以确保只有那些对患者护理和医院运营至关重要的人员正在大楼内工作。尽管我们认识到讲述这种大流行病如何影响我们的患者和医护人员的重要性，但我们的首要任务必须始终是隐私和安全。我们的团队还采取了其他措施，使我们的专家，护理人员和同意的患者可以远程获取新闻工作者的信息，以及我们的工作人员摄影师拍摄的图像和视频。 </p><p> As the daily death toll reaches shocking new highs, there continues to be relatively little photography of patients in hospitals. The Intercept reviewed the front pages of the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times for the past month and found no photos of hospital patients on all but a few days. When there is photography from inside hospitals, it is almost always of doctors and nurses. The pandemic certainly gets its share of visual coverage, but the pictures tend to be surrogates of suffering, such as people wearing masks as they wait for Covid-19 tests or go about their daily routines. Because it doesn’t happen often, when a powerful photo  from inside a hospital happens to emerge — such as Go Nakamura’s photo of a  doctor embracing a Covid-19 patient last month — it gets an enormous amount of attention.</p><p>随着每天的死亡人数达到令人震惊的新高，医院中对患者的摄影仍然相对较少。拦截截取了过去一个月《纽约时报》和《洛杉矶时报》的头版，除几天外没有发现医院病人的照片。当医院内部有摄影时，几乎总是由医生和护士拍摄的。大流行肯定会在视觉上得到应有的重视，但这些图片往往是痛苦的代名词，例如人们在等待Covid-19测试或进行日常活动时戴着口罩。由于这种情况不经常发生，因此当医院内出现一张有力的照片时，例如高中村刚（Go Nakamura）上个月为一名拥抱Covid-19病人的医生摄的照片时，它会引起极大的关注。</p><p>  “Events on this scale are understood through abstractions, which is necessary and likely helpful in terms of psychological defenses, but also results in a disconnect between people who experience it firsthand, and those who do not,” noted Dr. Elizabeth May, a psychiatry resident at a hospital in New York City. “As a physician, I wish that those close to me could really picture and see what I have seen, that I could know that they have seen this, and not feel like I need to protect their abstractions when what I really need is their support and empathy.”</p><p>  精神病学专家伊丽莎白·梅（Elizabeth May）指出：“如此规模的事件是通过抽象来理解的，这在心理防御方面是必要的，并且可能会有所帮助，但也会导致亲身体验与不亲身体验的人们之间的脱节。”居住在纽约市的一家医院。 “作为一名医生，我希望与我亲近的人能够真实地看到并看到我所看到的东西，我知道他们已经看到了这一点，并且当我真正需要的是他们的支持时，我不觉得我需要保护他们的抽象知识和同理心。”</p><p> Willingly or not, some hospitals have turned themselves into apparatuses of silence — and staff inside them are upset.</p><p> 不管愿意与否，一些医院已经将自己变成了沉默的设备，而其中的工作人员却很沮丧。</p><p> In April, when the first surge of the pandemic decimated New York City, a nurse at Lincoln Hospital shared video footage of herself and other staff describing the difficulty of treating Covid-19 patients without adequate protective gear or lifesaving supplies. The video was  published by The Intercept, and shortly afterward, the nurse, Lillian Udel, was  informed by the hospital that she was being investigated for HIPAA violations. That prompted another nurse at the hospital, Kelley Cabrera, to speak out. “HIPAA is kind of being used to gag people,”  she told The Intercept’s Akela Lacy. “We’re all experiencing the most difficult working conditions we’ve ever faced. And everybody who is speaking out is doing so to advocate for patients, ultimately. It looks like hospital administrations tend to run to HIPAA for their protection, not so much patient protection.”</p><p> 4月，当大流行的第一波潮席卷纽约市时，林肯医院的一名护士分享了她自己和其他工作人员的录像带，描述了在没有足够的防护装备或救生用品的情况下治疗Covid-19患者的困难。该视频由The Intercept发布，不久后，医院的护士Lillian Udel得知正在对她进行违反HIPAA的调查。这促使医院的另一位护士凯利·卡布雷拉（Kelley Cabrera）大声疾呼。她对The Intercept的Akela Lacy表示：“ HIPAA经常被用来嘲笑人们。” “我们都面临着前所未有的最艰苦的工作条件。最终，每个发表意见的人都在倡导患者。看起来医院管理部门倾向于向HIPAA寻求保护，而不是为患者提供保护。”</p><p> Do you have a coronavirus story you want to share? Email us at  [email protected] or use one of these secure methods to contact a reporter.</p><p> 您想分享一个冠状病毒的故事吗？通过[受电子邮件保护]给我们发送电子邮件，或使用以下安全方法之一与记者联系。</p><p> May, the psychiatry resident, noted how some hospitals, even in a pandemic, are reluctant to show what happens behind their doors.</p><p> 5月，这位精神病学住院医师指出，即使是在大流行中，有些医院也不愿透露自己的身后情况。</p><p> “Hospitals, as businesses, as profit-driven entities, do not want to be associated with death and suffering — it is very off-brand for them, I think,” said May. “So emerges an unfortunate dovetailing of HIPAA as a safeguard for civil rights and HIPAA as a vehicle for hiding off-brand aspects of medicine. … As a psychiatrist, I find myself thinking about shame and what role institutional shame has to play in the hiding of death and suffering.”</p><p> 梅说：“作为企业，作为企业，作为利润驱动的实体，医院不希望与死亡和痛苦联系在一起。我认为，医院对他们来说是非常烙印。” “因此出现了不幸的是，HIPAA作为保护公民权利的手段，而HIPAA作为隐藏非品牌药物的手段。 ……作为一名精神科医生，我发现自己正在思考羞耻感，以及制度上的羞耻感在隐藏死亡和痛苦中起着什么作用。” </p><p> Dr. Elisabeth Poorman, a physician in Seattle, was particularly blunt on social media. “Americans do not respond to statistics,” she  wrote on Twitter in June. “They respond to stories. Every hospital needs to let cameras in and show what dying of Covid looks like. Instead, PR depts silence us.” Responding to a commenter who said HIPAA was silencing the hospitals, Poorman shot back, “No, HIPAA is the excuse.” Earlier this month she told The Intercept, “I don’t really see things changing, because people don’t want to think creatively about this.”</p><p>西雅图的医生伊丽莎白·普尔曼（Elisabeth Poorman）博士在社交媒体上格外直率。她在六月的推特上写道：“美国人对统计数字没有反应。”他们回应故事。每家医院都需要让摄像机进入并显示Covid的死亡情况。相反，公关部门让我们保持沉默。”普尔曼在回应评论员说，HIPAA正在对医院进行消声时，回击说：“不，HIPAA是借口。”她在本月初告诉The Intercept，“我并没有真正看到变化，因为人们不想对此进行创造性思考。”</p><p>  When HIPAA was passed in 1996, the law did not include media guidelines. That changed after hospitals, seeking to increase their profiles and their revenues, opened their doors to reality TV shows. In 2012, one of those shows, “NY Med,” which starred Dr. Mehmet Oz,  broadcasted an episode that featured a blurred-out patient in the emergency room who had been hit by a sanitation truck. The patient died, and when the episode aired, his widow happened to be watching and recognized her late husband’s voice. She was shocked. Neither she nor anyone in her family had given permission for her husband’s last moments to be filmed.</p><p>  当1996年通过《 HIPAA》时，法律不包括媒体指南。在医院寻求增加个人资料和增加收入，打开真人秀节目的大门之后，情况发生了变化。 Mehmet Oz博士主演的其中一部节目“ NY Med”在2012年播出了一集，其中一名急诊室的一名模糊病人被卫生卡车撞倒。病人死了，当情节播出时，他的遗happened正好看着并且认出了已故丈夫的声音。她很震惊。无论是她还是家人，都没有允许她拍摄丈夫的最后时刻。</p><p> Four years later, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital  agreed to pay a $2.2 million fine. HHS also  announced strict new guidelines that required, before journalists could enter any patient area, “prior written authorization from each individual who is or will be in the area or whose PHI [protected health information] otherwise will be accessible to the media.” These guidelines in 2016 spelled the end of reality TV shows about hospitals and unfortunately turned them into no-go zones for reporters who, unlike reality TV crews, could be trusted to behave responsibly.</p><p> 四年后，纽约长老会医院同意支付220万美元的罚款。 HHS还宣布了严格的新准则，要求新闻工作者进入任何患者区域之前，“必须获得该区域内或即将进入该区域的每个人的事先书面授权，否则媒体将可以访问其PHI（受保护的健康信息）”。这些准则在2016年标志着有关医院的真人秀电视节目的结束，不幸的是，这些报道使记者们进入了禁区，与真人秀电视摄制组的工作人员不同，他们值得信赖地负责任。</p><p> Severino, choosing to reinforce rather than relax the 2016 guidelines, was unequivocal in May. “The Covid-19 public health emergency does not alter the HIPAA Privacy Rule’s existing restrictions on disclosures of protected health information (PHI) to the media,” his guidelines stated. “As explained in prior guidance, HIPAA does not permit covered health care providers to give the media, including film crews, access to any areas of their facilities where patients’ PHI will be accessible in any form ( e.g. written, electronic, oral, or other visual or audio form) without first obtaining a written HIPAA authorization form  from each patient whose PHI would be accessible to the media.” (The italics are in Severino’s guidance.)</p><p> Severino选择加强而不是放松2016年指南，在5月份毫不含糊。他的指南指出：“ Covid-19公共卫生突发事件不会改变HIPAA隐私规则对媒体披露受保护健康信息（PHI）的现有限制。” “如先前指南中所述，HIPAA不允许承保范围内的医疗保健提供者向媒体（包括摄制组）提供访问其设施中可以以任何形式（例如，书面，电子，口头或其他视觉或听觉形式），而无需先从媒体可访问其PHI的每个患者那里获得书面的HIPAA授权表格。 （斜体字在Severino的指南中。）</p><p> Severino declined an interview request from The Intercept, but his office released a short statement in his name that said his decision to relax some HIPAA guidelines “can help save lives during the pandemic.” His statement justified the reinforced media restrictions by saying that “hospitals allowing camera crews to film Covid-19 patients in distress without their permission is a breach of trust that violates patients’ privacy rights.” But this ignores the fact that the lessons of 2012 have been learned; nobody is proposing to broadcast videos or photos of non-consenting patients. In essence, Severino is all but barring journalists from hospitals because he says they will do something that they pledge they will not do and that hospitals would not permit them to do.</p><p> Severino拒绝了Intercept的采访请求，但他的办公室以他的名义发布了一条简短声明，称他放松一些HIPAA准则的决定“可以在大流行期间挽救生命”。他的声明证明了加强媒体的限制是合理的，他说：“医院允许摄制组在未经他们许可的情况下拍摄Covid-19遇险患者是违反信任的行为，侵犯了患者的隐私权。”但这忽略了已经吸取了2012年教训的事实。没有人提议广播未经同意的患者的视频或照片。本质上，Severino只是禁止记者进入医院，因为他说他们会做他们保证不会做的事情并且医院不允许他们做的事情。</p><p> Adam Greene, an expert on HIPAA and a partner at the law firm Davis Wright Tremaine, said it comes down to the amount of legal risk a hospital is willing to assume and the amount of time it is willing to devote to figuring that out. A hospital has to wade through a lot of regulatory questions before deciding to let a journalist inside, and that means tapping into legal resources that might be scarce or expensive. And if a decision is made to grant access, there’s always a chance that something could go wrong and a privacy breach could happen. “When you look at the incentives for hospitals, it is much easier to decline the request and avoid any risk of penalty,” Greene said. “There is not much in it for them to spend the time and resources to navigate HIPAA to find a way to do this.”</p><p> HIPAA的专家，律师事务所Davis Wright Tremaine的合伙人亚当·格林（Adam Greene）表示，这取决于医院愿意承担的法律风险以及愿意花时间解决这一问题的时间。在决定让记者进入医院之前，医院必须经历很多监管问题，这意味着要利用可能稀缺或昂贵的法律资源。而且，如果决定授予访问权限，则总是有可能出现问题并可能侵犯隐私。格林说：“当您考虑医院的诱因时，拒绝请求并避免罚款的风险要容易得多。” “对于他们来说，花很多时间和资源来浏览HIPAA并找到实现此目标的方法并没有太多。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://theintercept.com/2020/12/27/covid-photography-hospitals/">https://theintercept.com/2020/12/27/covid-photography-hospitals/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/医院/">#医院</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/media/">#media</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
