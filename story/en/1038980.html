Diapers, shampoo and laundry detergent began disappearing in bigger numbers, too.</p><p>在大流行初期，Joo Park注意到他在华盛顿市中心附近管理的市场发生了令人担忧的转变：每天至少一次，他发现有人将一包肉，一袋米饭或其他食物滑入衬衫或放在衣服下面夹克。尿布，洗发水和洗衣粉也开始大量消失。</p><p> Since then, he said, thefts have more than doubled at Capitol Supermarket — even though he now stations more employees at the entrance, asks shoppers to leave backpacks up front and displays high-theft items like hand sanitizer and baking yeast in more conspicuous areas. Park doesn’t usually call the police, choosing instead to bar offenders from coming back.</p><p> 他说，此后，国会大厦超市的盗窃案增加了一倍以上，尽管他现在在入口处派驻了更多的员工，要求购物者将背包放在前面，并在更显眼的区域展示诸如洗手液和烘焙酵母之类的高盗物品。帕克通常不报警，而是选择禁止罪犯再来。</p><p> “It’s become much harder during the pandemic,” he said. “People will say, ‘I was just hungry.’ And then what do you do?”</p><p> 他说：“在大流行期间变得越来越难。” “人们会说，‘我只是饿了。’那你怎么办？”</p><p>  The coronavirus recession has been a relentless churn of high unemployment and economic uncertainty. The government stimulus that kept millions of Americans from falling into poverty earlier in the pandemic is long gone, and new aid is still a dot on the horizon after months of congressional inaction. Hunger is chronic, at levels  not seen in decades.</p><p>  冠状病毒的衰退一直是高失业率和经济不确定性的不懈搅动。阻止数百万美国人在大流行中更早陷入贫困的政府刺激措施早已荡然无存，在几个月的国会不作为之后，新的援助仍然是一个空白。饥饿是长期的，处于几十年来未曾见过的水平。</p><p>   Shoplifting is up markedly since the pandemic began in the spring and at higher levels than in past economic downturns, according to interviews with more than a dozen retailers, security experts and police departments across the country. But what’s distinctive about this trend, experts say, is what’s being taken — more staples like bread, pasta and baby formula.</p><p>   据对全国十多家零售商，安全专家和警察部门的采访显示，自大流行于春季开始以来，入店行窃活动明显增加，而且其水平高于过去的经济低迷时期。但是，专家们说，这种趋势的独特之处在于正在采取的做法-更多的主食，例如面包，意大利面和婴儿配方奶粉。</p><p>  “We’re seeing an increase in low-impact crimes,” said Jeff Zisner, chief executive of workplace security firm Aegis. “It’s not a whole lot of people going in, grabbing TVs and running out the front door. It’s a very different kind of crime — it’s people stealing consumables and items associated with children and babies.”</p><p>  工作场所安全公司Aegis首席执行官Jeff Zisner表示：“我们看到的是影响力较小的犯罪活动在增加。” “不是很多人走进来，抢着电视，跑到前门。这是完全不同的一种犯罪-人们偷窃与儿童和婴儿有关的消费品和物品。”</p><p>  With Americans being advised to brace for a difficult winter amid skyrocketing  coronavirus infection rates and the economic recovery nearly stalled, the near-term outlook is grim. More than  20 million Americans are on some form of unemployment assistance, and 12 million will run out of benefits the day after Christmas unless new relief materializes. Though lawmakers have made progress this week on a $908 billion bill, details are still being worked out, congressional aides said.</p><p>  建议美国人在冠状病毒感染率飙升的情况下度过艰难的冬天，并且经济复苏几乎停滞不前，因此近期前景严峻。超过2000万的美国人正在接受某种形式的失业援助，除非有新的救济落实，否则圣诞节后第二天将有1200万美国人的福利用尽。国会助手说，尽管国会议员本周在9080亿美元的法案上取得了进展，但细节仍在制定中。 </p><p>  Meanwhile, an estimated 54 million Americans will struggle with hunger this year, a 45 percent increase from 2019, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. With food aid programs like SNAP and WIC being reduced, and other federal assistance on the brink of expiration, food banks and pantries are being inundated, reporting hours-long waits and lines that stretch into the thousands.</p><p>同时，根据美国农业部的数据，今年估计有5400万美国人将与饥饿作斗争，比2019年增加了45％。随着诸如SNAP和WIC之类的粮食援助计划的减少，以及其他即将到期的联邦援助，粮食银行和食品储藏室被淹没，报告了长达数小时的等待和排队。</p><p>  Several  federal food programs that have provided billions of dollars in fresh produce, dairy and meat to U.S. food banks also are set to expire at the end of the year. The largest among them, the Farmers to Families Food Box, has provided more than 120 million food boxes during the pandemic and is already running out of funding in many parts of the country.</p><p>  向美国食品银行提供数十亿美元新鲜农产品，乳制品和肉类的几个联邦食品计划也将在今年年底到期。其中最大的一个是“农民到家庭的食品箱”，在大流行期间提供了超过1.2亿个食品箱，在该国许多地方已经用光了资金。</p><p>  With the United States now registering more than 150,000 new coronavirus cases a day, some communities are reintroducing restrictions in an effort to contain the virus. Most of California is now under strict stay-at-home orders, for example, while states including Nevada, Maryland and Pennsylvania have issued new indoor occupancy limits. Such orders tend to hit already vulnerable workers in low-wage service jobs in restaurants, retail and bars the hardest.</p><p>  随着美国现在每天登记超过15万例新的冠状病毒病例，一些社区正在重新引入限制措施以遏制该病毒。例如，加利福尼亚州的大部分地区现在都处于严格的全屋服务状态，而内华达州，马里兰州和宾夕法尼亚州等州则发布了新的室内入住限制。这样的订单往往会给餐饮，零售和酒吧低薪服务工作中本已脆弱的工人造成最严重的打击。</p><p>  In Maryland, Jean was successfully juggling college and a job, and had just bought her first car, when the pandemic crashed down like a sneaker wave. Her son’s day-care center suddenly closed in April, forcing her to give up her $15-an-hour job as a receptionist. But quitting meant she didn’t qualify for unemployment benefits. She says she was denied food stamps at least three times and gave up on local food banks because of the lines.</p><p>  在马里兰州，吉恩（Jean）成功地兼顾了大学和一份工作，并在大流行像运动鞋冲击波一样倒塌时刚刚购买了她的第一辆汽车。她儿子的日托中心在4月突然关闭，迫使她放弃了每小时15美元的接待员工作。但是辞职意味着她没有资格获得失业救济。她说，她至少被拒绝了三次食品券，并因为排队而放弃了当地的食品银行。</p><p>  With no stimulus aid and her savings gone by May, Jean said she was out of options. So she began sneaking food into her son’s stroller at the local Walmart. She said she’d take things like ground beef, rice or potatoes but always pay for something small, like a packet of M&amp;M’s. Each time, she’d tell herself that God would understand.</p><p>  吉恩表示，由于没有刺激性援助，她的积蓄到了五月就消失了，她已经选择不了了。因此，她开始在当地的沃尔玛（Walmart）将食物偷偷溜进儿子的手推车。她说，她会吃牛肉，米饭或土豆之类的东西，但总是要花一些小钱，例如一包M＆amp; M。每次，她都会告诉自己上帝会理解的。</p><p> “I used to think, if I get in trouble, I’d say, ‘Look, I’m sorry, I wasn’t stealing a television. I just didn’t know what else to do. It wasn’t malicious. We were hungry,’ ” said Jean, 21 , who asked to be identified by her middle name to discuss her situation freely. “It’s not something I’m proud of, but it’s what I had to do.”</p><p> “我曾经想过，如果遇到麻烦，我会说，‘看，对不起，我不是在偷电视。我只是不知道该怎么办。这不是恶意的。我们很饿，”“ 21岁的让恩说，她要求以她的中间姓氏身份来讨论她的处境。 “这不是我引以为豪的事情，但这是我必须要做的。”</p><p>  Retailers have historically been most concerned about staff when it comes to what they call “shrink.” Workers are typically behind about a quarter of the $25 billion in global losses reported each year, a category that includes lost merchandise, stolen cash and employee errors, security experts say.</p><p>  从历史上看，零售商一直最关注员工的“收缩”。安全专家说，在每年报告的全球250亿美元的损失中，工人通常占大约四分之一，这一类别包括商品损失，现金被盗和员工失误。 </p><p>   That changed with the pandemic as customer shoplifting became more pronounced, especially in areas with high joblessness, said Fabien Tiburce, chief executive of Compliant IA, which provides loss prevention software to retailers. “There is a well-known historical correlation between unemployment and theft,” he said, a connection that is more entrenched in the United States than in countries with more robust safety nets like Canada and Australia.</p><p>Compilant IA首席执行官Fabien Tiburce说，随着大流行的流行，这种情况发生了改变，特别是在失业率较高的地区，顾客入店行窃变得更加明显，该公司向零售商提供防损失软件。他说：“失业与盗窃之间存在着众所周知的历史关联，”与美国和加拿大和澳大利亚等拥有健全安全网的国家相比，这种联系在美国更为牢固。</p><p>  Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, which often are concentrated in low-income areas, have seen “increasing instances of theft” during the past year, according to spokeswoman Kayleigh Painter. She declined to share specific data or protocols, but said the company is “continually evaluating and enhancing on-premise security and surveillance systems, as well as our associate training.”</p><p>  女发言人凯里·画家（Kayleigh Painter）表示，过去一年中，“美元树”和“家庭美元”通常集中在低收入地区，“盗窃案在增加”。她拒绝透露具体的数据或协议，但表示公司“正在不断评估和增强内部安全和监视系统，以及我们的相关人员培训。”</p><p> In Philadelphia, reports of retail theft jumped about 60 percent, year over year, just after President Trump declared a national emergency in March because of the pandemic. They remained at elevated levels through at least July, according to local police data.</p><p> 在费城，就在特朗普总统于三月份因大流行宣布全国紧急状态之后，零售盗窃的报告同比增长了约60％。根据当地警方的数据，他们至少在7月份一直处于较高水平。</p><p>   Though shoplifting tends to spike during national crises — it jumped 16 percent after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and 34 percent after the 2008 recession, according to the National Association for Shoplifting Prevention, which tracks data from U.S. courts — the current trend line is skewing even higher, according to Read Hayes, a criminologist at the University of Florida and the director of the Loss Prevention Research Council.</p><p>   追踪美国法院数据的国家预防盗窃协会（National Association for Shoplifting Prevention）的数据显示，虽然入店行窃往往会在国家危机期间激增，但在2001年9月11日的袭击后暴涨了16％，在2008年经济衰退后暴涨了34％。佛罗里达大学犯罪学家，防损研究委员会主任雷德·海斯（Read Hayes）表示，这一数字甚至更高。</p><p> Hayes has been tracking theft since the coronavirus began sweeping across the United States in March, and has phone calls with the leaders of 60 major retail chains every other week to help them prevent losses. Most reports of retail theft have been anecdotal, he said, and even 10 months into the pandemic, it’s too early to know the full scope.</p><p> 自从3月冠状病毒开始在美国蔓延以来，海耶斯一直在追踪盗窃行为，并且每隔一周与60个主要零售连锁店的领导打来电话，以帮助他们防止损失。他说，大多数关于零售盗窃的报道都是零星的，甚至在大流行10个月后，要了解全部范围还为时过早。</p><p> “We believe there is some increase in people who, because of covid-19, are not able to pay for the items,” Hayes said. “It’s sort of maintained that there may be a slight uptick in need-based stuff, but it’s really difficult to tease that out.”</p><p> 海斯说：“我们相信由于covid-19而无法支付这些物品的人有所增加。” “有人认为，基于需求的内容可能会略有增加，但是要弄清楚这一点确实很难。”</p><p>  In Virginia, Sloane, 28, says she has been dropping avocados, mushrooms and other fresh produce into her bag without paying for them since September. She worries constantly about getting caught and takes only a couple of items at a time. “But when you’re eating cheap meals every day, sometimes it’s nice to have an avocado to spice things up for one night,” she said.</p><p>  28岁的斯隆（Sloane）在弗吉尼亚州说，自9月份以来，她就一直在不花钱就把鳄梨，蘑菇和其他新鲜农产品放进包里。她一直担心被抓到，一次只拿几个东西。她说：“但是当您每天都在吃便宜的饭菜时，有时候鳄梨可以为一整夜的调味品增添乐趣。” </p><p>   Sloane, who asked to be identified by only her first name to avoid potential prosecution, worked in the food industry until the pandemic upended her job. Her partner, who worked in retail, was furloughed for months, then quit in August because it no longer felt safe going back to work. But the resignation meant no unemployment benefits.</p><p>斯隆（Sloane）要求仅以她的名字来识别以避免潜在的起诉，她一直在食品工业中工作，直到大流行使她的工作变得更糟。她的合伙人从事零售业，休假了几个月，然后在8月份辞职，因为重新上班不再安全。但是辞职意味着没有失业救济金。</p><p> “Things are bad: We’re late on bills, we’re late on rent, our car is nine days away from being repossessed,” she said. “I’m used to being very self-sufficient and it’s an awful feeling to suddenly be so desperate.”</p><p> 她说：“情况很糟糕：我们迟到了账单，我们迟到了租金，我们的车距离被收押还差九天。” “我习惯于自给自足，突然变得如此绝望是一种可怕的感觉。”</p><p> Like others interviewed by The Washington Post, Sloane said she tends to target major chains because they’re better able to absorb the losses than small businesses.</p><p> 像《华盛顿邮报》采访的其他人一样，斯隆说，她倾向于以大型连锁店为目标，因为大型连锁店比小企业更能承受损失。</p><p>  Park, of Capitol Supermarket in Washington, D.C., for example, said he briefly considered hiring uniformed security guards to ward against theft, but decided it was too costly for the family-run business, which already has had to cut more than half its staff during the pandemic.</p><p>  例如，位于华盛顿特区的国会大厦超市的帕克说，他曾短暂考虑过聘请穿制服的保安人员以防盗窃，但他认为这对于家族企业来说太昂贵了，因为家族企业已经不得不裁员一半以上。在大流行期间。</p><p>  “My distrust has gone up since I see people shoplifting every day,” he said. “I watch the security cameras a lot more often. If we let too many people steal, we’ll have to close.”</p><p>  他说：“自从我每天看到人们入店行窃以来，我的不信任感加剧了。” “我经常看安全摄像机。如果我们让太多人偷，我们将不得不关闭。”</p><p> Because tracking is spotty, shoplifting is chronically underreported, according to more than a dozen local police departments and sheriff’s offices contacted by The Post. Very few monitor and report shoplifting data publicly, and those that do often don’t keep tabs on what types of items are stolen.</p><p> 据《邮报》联系的十多个地方警察部门和警长办公室说，由于跟踪不完整，因此长期以来偷窃行为的报道不足。很少有公开监视和报告入店行窃数据的人，而经常监视和报告入店行窃数据的人却不知道被盗物品的类型。</p><p>  Some store managers said they’ve stopped calling the police for small instances of shoplifting because it’s not worth the time or resources, particularly when store employees also are juggling new responsibilities such as temperature checks and enforcing mask requirements. But many are taking additional precautions: Demand for uniformed security guards and undercover loss prevention experts has risen 35 percent during the pandemic, according to Zisner of Aegis.</p><p>  一些商店经理说，他们已经停止了小偷行窃的举动，因为这是不值得的时间或资源，尤其是在商店员工还担负着新的职责（例如温度检查和强制执行口罩要求）的情况下。但是，许多人正在采取额外的预防措施：在大流行期间，对穿制服的保安人员和秘密损失预防专家的需求增加了35％。 </p><p>  Nearly  26 million adults — or 1 in 8 Americans — reported not having enough food to eat as of mid-November, according to the latest data from the Census Bureau. That figure has climbed steadily during the pandemic, and has hit record highs since the government agency began collecting such data in 1998.</p><p>根据人口普查局的最新数据，截至11月中旬，将近2千6百万成年人（即八分之一的美国人）表示食物不足。在大流行期间，这一数字稳步上升，并自政府机构于1998年开始收集此类数据以来，创下了历史新高。</p><p>  “We’re supposed to be the greatest, richest country in the world, and we don’t have safety nets for when something like this happens?” said Danielle Nierenberg, president and founder of Food Tank, a nonprofit organization focused on food equity and sustainability. “People are being forced to steal when they shouldn’t have to, and that’s a great American tragedy.”</p><p>  “我们应该是世界上最大，最富裕的国家，而当这样的事情发生时，我们没有安全网吗？”非营利性组织Food Tank的总裁兼创始人Danielle Nierenberg说。 “人们在不必要的时候被迫偷窃，这是美国人的悲剧。”</p><p> Alex graduated with a master’s degree in May and was immediately in a bind: no job, no money and, with much of the country still shut down, little hope that anything would change.</p><p> 亚历克斯（Alex）于5月份获得了硕士学位，并立即陷入困境：没有工作，没有钱，而且在美国大部分地区仍然关闭的情况下，几乎没有希望发生任何变化的希望。</p><p> She’d spent most of her $1,200 stimulus check on rent, and used what little she had left to buy groceries. Everything else — vitamins, moisturizer, body wash — she said she shoplifted from a Whole Foods Market a few miles from her apartment in Chicago.</p><p> 她将1,200美元的刺激性支票中的大部分用于租金，并用剩余的很少的钱来购买食品杂货。她说，其他所有东西-维生素，保湿霜，沐浴露-她从距离芝加哥公寓几英里的全食市场购物。</p><p> “It was like, I could spend $10 and get a couple of vegetables or I could spend $10 on just a box of tampons,” said Alex, 27, who asked to be identified by her middle name to speak candidly. She has a job now, earning $15 an hour, but still struggles to make ends meet. She says she continues to shoplift — something she’d never done before the pandemic — every few weeks.</p><p> 27岁的亚历克斯说：“这就像我可以花10美元买几棵蔬菜，或者我只花10美元买一盒卫生棉条，”她被要求以中间姓氏身份坦率地说。她现在有一份工作，每小时收入15美元，但仍在挣钱。她说，她每隔几周就继续购物，这是大流行之前从未做过的事情。</p><p> She says she moves through the store mostly unnoticed. Usually, she said, she picks up a few bulky vegetables — a bunch of kale, maybe, or a few avocados — to disguise the pricier items she slips into her bag at the self checkout.</p><p> 她说，她几乎没有被人注意到在商店里逛。她说，通常情况下，她会捡一些大块的蔬菜-一堆羽衣甘蓝，或者一些鳄梨-来掩饰自己在自助结账时滑进包里的贵重物品。</p><p> “I don’t feel much guilt about it,” she said. “It’s been very frustrating to be part of a class of people who is losing so much right now. And then to have another class who is profiting from the pandemic — well, let’s just say I don’t feel too bad about taking $15 or $20 of stuff from Whole Foods when Jeff Bezos is the richest man on Earth.” (Bezos is the founder and chief executive of Amazon, which owns Whole Foods. He also owns The Washington Post.)</p><p> 她说：“对此我并不感到内。” “成为现在正在流失如此之多的一类人的一部分，这非常令人沮丧。然后要有另一个从大流行中获利的班级-好吧，让我说，当杰夫·贝索斯（Jeff Bezos）是地球上最富有的人时，我对从Whole Foods拿走15或20美元的东西并不感到很遗憾。 （贝索斯是拥有Whole Foods的亚马逊的创始人兼首席执行官。他还拥有《华盛顿邮报》。） </p><p>   Jean, the single mother from Maryland, said she had shoplifted a few times before the pandemic, driving to a Walmart one state over for cans of formula when she couldn’t produce enough breastmilk for her infant son. She stopped once the store began locking up baby formula, which many retailers do because of its high price.</p><p>吉恩（Jean）是来自马里兰州的单身母亲，她说，在大流行之前，她已经购物了几次，当她无法为婴儿的儿子生产足够的母乳时，开车到一个州的沃尔玛购买配方奶粉。一旦商店开始锁定婴儿配方奶粉，她便停了下来，由于价格高昂，许多零售商都这样做了。</p><p>  But the coronavirus crisis, she said, ushered in a new level of desperation. Finding a job and child care became increasingly difficult. When money became tight, she prioritized rent and car payments over groceries. “My car, my apartment were things that could be taken from me — and then where would that leave me and my son?” she said. “This is going to sound bad, but at least I could try to get food in other ways.”</p><p>  她说，但是冠状病毒危机带来了绝望的新高度。找工作和育儿变得越来越困难。当资金紧缺时，她将租金和购车费用排在了杂货之上。 “我的车，我的公寓是可以从我身上拿走的东西，那我和我的儿子又该丢在哪里？”她说。 “这听起来很糟糕，但至少我可以尝试以其他方式来获取食物。”</p><p> Her mother sometimes helped, sending a few hundred dollars or using her own food stamps to pay for chicken and frozen peas. That tided her over until July, when she got a big break: a full-time job in a new state making $16 an hour. Jean has health insurance now and donates to the local food pantry.</p><p> 她的母亲有时会帮忙，寄出几百美元或用自己的食物券来支付鸡肉和冷冻豌豆。这使她受累直到七月份，当时她有了一个大的休息：在新州从事一份全职工作，每小时赚16美元。吉恩现在拥有健康保险，并向当地的食品储藏室捐款。</p><p> She hopes she’ll never have to steal again, though she says her sense of security is fleeting.</p><p> 她希望自己再也不必偷东西了，尽管她说她的安全感正在转瞬即逝。</p><p> “I know what it’s like to do everything you can and still not make it,” she said. “And I know it could happen again.”</p><p> 她说：“我知道尽一切所能却仍然没有做到的是什么样的感觉。” “而且我知道它可能再次发生。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/12/10/pandemic-shoplifting-hunger/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/12/10/pandemic-shoplifting-hunger/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
