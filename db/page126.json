"note_en": "In  No One is Even Trying, I wrote that Grant Sanderson\u2019s Youtube channel  3B1B has 161 million views. Based on how Youtube counts \u201cviews\u201d, that\u2019s between 1.3 and 21.4 million hours of learning.\n This is incredible to me. If you asked me last night who my hero is, I would have said Grant Sanderson. If you asked me what\u2019s wrong with the world, I would have said that there aren\u2019t more people like him.\n  A regular teacher, teaching 8am\u20133pm  180 days a year to a  class of 20 is producing 25,000 learning hours a year! Over a 50 year career, that\u2019s 1.3 million, same as Sanderson, though in 10x as much time.\n It\u2019s even more surprising to compare a teacher with Khan Academy. Depending on how you count \u201cviews\u201d they\u2019re at 15 million to 120 million learning hours. But they have 600 employees, and they\u2019ve been around for 12 years. So that\u2019s best case 17,000, worst case 2,000 learning hours per employee per year, compared to a regular teacher\u2019s 25,000.\n That\u2019s a little unfair, Khan Academy hasn\u2019t had 600 employees for the full 12 years. But if we assume linear growth, they\u2019ve averaged 300 employees, which would increase their learning hours to 4,000 (best case 33,000).\n To be clear, the point is not that Khan Academy is bad (they have way more than lectures, and they\u2019re available to anyone with an internet connection for free). The point is that seemingly non-scalable things like teaching can still multiply out to surprisingly large impact.\n Since views counts on Youtube are  legible and quantified, it\u2019s really easy to see 100,000,000 and feel really impressed. But counting a view as 30 seconds, a teacher with 20 students and a 50 year career could hit 1.3 million learning hours, the equivalent of 151 million \u201cviews\u201d!\n Until now, I didn\u2019t have that much respect for teachers. I understood that they\u2019re probably good people, and a lot of them teach as a labor of love, but I didn\u2019t appreciate their impact.\n In fact, teaching has been my go-to example for illustrating how effective altruism differs from lay person opinions. Teaching seems like a great job, but if you think about it through an EA lens, it\u2019s just not very impactful. 80,000 hours has very negative reviews of  teaching, and another article of  reasons not to go into education.\n Nothing I\u2019ve learned recently invalidates those articles. And yet, it\u2019s hard to reconcile my belief in the seeming inefficacy of teaching jobs with my reverence for Sanderson. As always,  one man\u2019s modus ponens is another man\u2019s modus tollens. I can have whichever belief I want, but not both of them at once. Either teachers are heroes, or Sanderson is merely moderately praiseworthy.\n  You\u2019re driving through a small town, and while stopping for lunch, hear rumors of a teacher who delivers unusually engaging lectures. As someone interested in pedagogy and social impact at scale, you decide to go check it out in person, and sure enough, the teacher\u2019s amazing!\n What would your first thought be? If you\u2019re like me, your first conscious reaction would be \u201cwe\u2019ve got to get this guy on Youtube!\u201d If you\u2019re like me, you see it as a horrendous waste of potential that this brilliant educator is stuck in a small town when he could be on the internet, delivering content to the masses at scale.\n So you talk to him, set up a small film crew, convince him to take time off teaching to record Youtube lectures, and sure enough it\u2019s a hit! Within your first few years, he\u2019s up to 10 million views.\n And yet, it turns out that intuition is totally wrong. He was already clocking in \u201c10 million views\u201d every few years. Of course there are benefits of being online. The content is recorded, the students could be anywhere in the world, you can go back if you missed a section. But none of that feels sufficient to justify my initial reaction.\n Maybe I\u2019m just a shameless technophile retroactively justifying my beliefs, but I think there\u2019s still a good reason to revere Sanderson.\n I love 3B1B videos because they\u2019re creative and engaging in a way that math never was in school. It genuinely feels like he\u2019s broken through whatever obfuscation prevents kids from understanding math, and discovered better ways of explaining key concepts. And because math is so fundamental to reasoning, this is more than a good educational channel. It feels almost like a leap forward for civilization.\n But still, that\u2019s not a metric effective altruism cares about. Maybe the real modus tollens is to abbandon the value system.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 16:56:19", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

", "note_en": "When the human genome was first  deemed \u201ccomplete\u201d in 2000, the news was met with great international fanfare. The two rival groups vying to finish the genome first\u2014one a large government-led consortium, the other an underdog private company\u2014agreed to declare joint success. They shook hands at the White House. Bill Clinton presided. Tony Blair  beamed in from London. \u201cWe are standing at an extraordinary moment in scientific history,\u201d  one prominent scientist declared when those genomes were published. \u201cIt\u2019s as though we have climbed to the top of the Himalayas.\u201d\n But actually, the human genome was not complete. Neither group had reached the real summit. As even the contemporary coverage acknowledged, that version was more of a rough draft, riddled with long stretches where the DNA sequence was still fuzzy or missing. The private company soon pivoted and ended its human-genome project, though scientists with the public consortium soldiered on. In 2003, with less glitz but still  plenty  of headlines, the human genome was declared complete once again.\n But actually, the human genome was  still not complete. Even the revised draft was missing about 8 percent of the genome. These were the hardest-to-sequence regions, full of repeating letters that were simply impossible to read with the technology at the time.\n  Finally, this May, a separate group of scientists quietly posted a  preprint online describing what can be deemed the first truly complete human genome\u2014a readout of all 3.055 billion letters across 23 human chromosomes. The group, led by relatively young researchers, came together on Slack from around the world to finish the task abandoned 20 years ago. There was no splashy White House announcement this time, no talk of summiting the Himalayas; the paper itself is still under review for official publication in a journal. But the lack of pomp belies what an achievement this is: To complete the human genome, these scientists had to figure out how to map its most mysterious and neglected repeating regions, which may now finally get their scientific due.\n \u201cI consider this a landmark,\u201d says Steven Henikoff, a molecular biologist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, who was not involved in the project. Henikoff studies one of those enigmatic, hard-to-sequence regions where previous human-genome projects had given up: centromeres, which are the slightly pinched middles of each chromosome. Chromosomes, of which humans have 23 pairs, each consist of a long, continuous stretch of DNA that can be condensed into a rod shape; the DNA at the centromere is particularly dense.\n On five human chromosomes, the centromere is not in the middle but very close to one end, dividing the chromosome into one long and one very short arm. These short arms are also full of repeats that had never been entirely sequenced until now. Centromeres, short arms, and other types of repeating regions made up most of the 238 million letters the consortium ultimately added or corrected in the human genome.\n  The repeat-rich segments of the human genome do not usually contain genes, which is one reason they\u2019ve long been neglected. Geneticists have focused largely on genes because their function is obvious and simple: A gene encodes a protein. (One big surprise of the earlier drafts of the human genome is how little of our DNA actually encodes proteins\u2014 only 1 percent. The role of the remaining 99 percent is becoming clearer.) Indeed, there have been hints that these repeat-rich regions also play important roles in how genes get expressed and passed on, and anomalies in them have been  linked to cancer and aging. The consortium found 79 new genes hidden among the repeats too. With a map of these repeating regions finally in hand, scientists can probe more carefully their function.\n The effort to finish the genome was \u201centirely grassroots,\u201d says Adam Phillippy, a computational geneticist at the National Institutes of Health who co-leads the  Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) consortium that completed the genome. (Telomeres are the regions at the ends of chromosomes, so telomere to telomere means \u201cend to end.\u201d) Phillippy and Karen Miga, a geneticist at UC Santa Cruz, decided to create the consortium in 2018, after a call when they realized that they both harbored ambitions of finishing the human genome.\n \u201cI\u2019m in love with repeats,\u201d says Miga, who came to the project as a biologist trying to understand what those repeats do. Phillippy, a computer scientist by training, brought technical chops. Traditional sequencing technologies fragment DNA into small pieces, and computer algorithms have to reassemble them like puzzle pieces. The problem is that the pieces from repeating regions all look nearly the same. Now two new \u201clong-read\u201d sequencing technologies\u2014called PacBio HiFi and Oxford Nanopore\u2014allow scientists to read longer stretches of the genome. These sequencers still can\u2019t handle chunks big enough to cross an entire centromere or a short arm, but at least the algorithms have larger puzzle pieces to assemble.\n The role of centromere sequences, like many other repeating regions, is not yet fully understood, but they are most classically known as the key to cell division. When a cell divides in two, a protein spindle attaches to the centromeres, yanking the chromosomes apart to make sure that each cell gets the right number. When this goes wrong in eggs or sperm, babies can be born with chromosomal anomalies such as  Down syndrome or Turner syndrome. When it goes wrong in other parts of the body, we can end up with blood cells, for example, that have too many or too few chromosomes. This is a hallmark of aging: It\u2019s not unusual for men older than 70  to have lost the Y chromosomes in their blood cells. In  one of two  companion papers uploaded alongside the complete genome, the T2T consortium showed that Oxford Nanopore\u2019s long-read technology can also be used to map where exactly the protein spindle attaches to the centromere. Examining the sequences in those regions might yield new clues to chromosomal anomalies.\n  The repeat-rich short arms of the chromosomes are similarly mysterious. They definitely play some role in the cellular machinery that translates genes into proteins, and knowing their sequences could shed more light on that function. Brian McStay, a biologist at the National University of Ireland at Galway, likens the complete genome to a \u201cparts list\u201d for chromosomes that allows scientists to try taking out the building blocks one by one. \u201cKnowing what this parts list is, we can say, \u2018This is exactly what our chromosome looks like,\u2019\u201d McStay says. \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s delete this and see what the impact on the function of that chromosome is.\u2019\u201d\n As impressive as the technical feat of sequencing a complete human genome is, scientists told me that one genome is only one snapshot. Seeing how these repeating regions change over time from person to person, species to species, will be far more interesting. \u201cWhat happens in cancer? What happens in development? What happens if you compare offspring to parents?\u201d Henikoff says. The consortium proved that these repeating regions are sequenceable with the new long-read technologies. Now they can be applied to more genomes, allowing scientists to compare one with another.\n Indeed, Miga says that the ultimate dream is to make every genome that scientists attempt to sequence complete from end to end, telomere to telomere. But first, the group has a more immediate goal in mind. If you wanted to fault the new genome for not being \u201ccomplete,\u201d you could point to the fact that it comprises only a single set of 23 chromosomes, whereas normal human cells have 23 pairs. To simplify the task, the group used cells from a particular type of tumor that develops from an abnormal fertilized egg and ends up with just 23 single chromosomes. The team will have to use different cells, with 23 pairs of chromosomes, to complete what is known as a \u201cdiploid\u201d genome.\n  \u201cThe next major milestone would be routine diploid genomes,\u201d says Shilpa Garg, a geneticist at the University of Copenhagen, in Denmark. Garg  has used PacBio HiFi to rapidly assemble human genomes\u2014minus some tricky regions such as the centromeres\u2014at a rate of a few per day. That speed could help in clinical settings too, by making it easier for doctors to more regularly diagnose patients using genome sequencing. (In comparison, she says, assembling genomes from older sequencing technology takes as long as three weeks.)  Truly complete genome sequencing, repeating regions and all, is getting easier and faster. Soon, another complete human genome will not be news at all.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 16:56:00", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4eba\u7c7b,genome,\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4", "title": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u662f\u6700\u7ec8 -

Apple intends to prevent apps from tracking users using their unique device identifier, or IDFA, without their explicit permission \u2013 something that Facebook\u2019s Audience Network uses to personalise advertising in third-party apps.\n Facebook said that doing so would have a significant impact on Audience Network, cutting its revenue on iOS by up to 50% because of an inability to deliver more valuable, targeted advertising. It may even force Facebook to stop developing Audience Network for iOS altogether, the company said.\n \u201cThis is not a change we want to make, but unfortunately Apple\u2019s updates to iOS 14 have forced this decision. We know this may severely impact publishers\u2019 ability to monetise through Audience Network on iOS 14, and, despite our best efforts, may render Audience Network so ineffective on iOS 14 that it may not make sense to offer it on iOS 14 in the future,\u201d the blog post said.\n Audience Network is only one piece of Facebook\u2019s revenue (it\u2019s unclear precisely how much), and its core business of advertising inside its own apps will be unaffected. But any attempt to curtail data collection can pose a threat to Facebook, and the company has recently been vocal about the risks that regulators and platform changes pose.\n During a recent earnings call with analysts,   company executives argued that Facebook was a \u201clifeline\u201d for small businesses during the pandemic and that preventing them from effectively targeting people with ads could have dangerous \u201cmacro-economic effects.\u201d\n It\u2019s an argument that Facebook reiterated in its Wednesday blog post: \u201cWe understand that iOS 14 will hurt many of our developers and publishers at an already difficult time for businesses. We work with more than 19,000 developers and publishers from around the globe and in 2019 we paid out billions of dollars. Many of these are small businesses that depend on ads to support their livelihood.\u201d\n Do you work at Facebook?

There are currently 33 active large fires across the West. The biggest has scorched more than 175,000 acres in the canyons and valleys east of Phoenix. It is 73% contained.\n    A record-breaking heat wave across the West this week isn&#39;t helping ease fire danger. Temperatures have soared into the triple digits in Salt Lake City, Las Vegas and Montana, where new wildfires are sparking weeks earlier than normal.\n    They include a 24,000-acre fire burning northeast of Yellowstone National Park near the town of Red Lodge, Mont. It has destroyed 18 structures so far and is 0% contained. The timber and grasses there are unusually dry for this time of year.\n    &#34;It&#39;s not very typical,&#34; said Billy Chapman, public information officer at Custer-Gallatin National Forest. &#34;I think a lot of it&#39;s the heat. We have not had any spring rain really.&#34;\n  Chapman predicts a severe wildfire season if the abnormally warm temperatures and dry conditions continue into the summer.\n  &#34;Things could change \u2013 and I hope they do \u2013 but this is not a good trend,&#34; he said.\n  High winds have fueled another large fire burning near Montana&#39;s capital, Helena, where a state Department of Natural Resources and Conservation helicopter crash-landed while battling the blaze. All five crew members survived with minor injuries.\n An earlier version of this story said in a photo caption that the Robertson Draw Fire was south of Buffalo, Wyo. In fact, it is south of Red Lodge, Mont.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 15:32:32", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u91ce\u706b,high,\u706b\u707e", "title":

", "note_en": "A  video posted by the Australian restaurant  Crux on TikTok last month shows something you\u2019d expect from any influencer filming their Sunday brunch: A knife slowly breaks an egg\u2014blanketed in hollandaise, as any good eggs Benedict is\u2014until golden yolk oozes out. But appearances are deceiving, and as the text overlaid onto the clip makes clear: Yes, it\u2019s vegan. And yes, it pops.\n  For vegans,  lacto-vegetarians, and anyone else cutting their egg consumption, there have long been many ways to replace the functions of the egg. Flax seeds, chia seeds, bananas, applesauce, and starch blends like Ener-G Egg Replacer perform the binding tasks that eggs do so well\u2014a guide to which can be found  in Taste. Tofu can be scrambled, and chickpea flour can be cooked into a thin, omelette-esque sheet. Other commercial egg replacer options are on the rise as veganism  sees an exciting heyday.\n  Follow Your Heart, the 50-year-old leader in the plant-based space, launched a substitute intended for scrambles  in 2015.  Vegg sells egg replacer products including a  powder meant to simulate the taste and texture of egg yolks in dishes like French toast. The juggernaut is  JUST Egg, whose mung bean-based liquid that scrambles like real eggs, hit the United States  in 2018. By March of this year, when JUST  received a $200 million investment backed by the Qatar Investment Authority,\u00a0 the company had sold the equivalent of 100 million chicken eggs. Chicken eggs remain big business:  In 2019, Americans were eating about 279 eggs per person per year\u2014the highest egg consumption in almost 50 years, the  Washington Post reported.\n  But there\u2019s a particular pleasure that commercial vegan products haven\u2019t yet captured: the egg yolk in all of its gooey, globular, food porn-y glory. The yolk, after all, has much to do with the indulgent Instagram appeal of \u201c putting  an egg  on it,\u201d whether \u201cit\u201d is a pizza, a burger, or a breakfast hash. For those who don\u2019t want to give up the concept of the egg entirely, the vegan egg with silky whites and a spherical liquid yolk is elusive but not out of reach. This is how obsessed cooks in home and restaurant kitchens have tinkered with science to make the plant-based yolk pop possible.\n  Crux, which opened in Adelaide in 2018, offers vegan eggs two ways. The eggs Benedict contains their poached version, which uses a cashew base for the whites and tomatoes for the yolks. The breakfast sandwich features their facsimile of a fried egg, complete with shiny, soy-based whites with lacy edges and the same bubble of a yolk. Though you can tell that the egg yolks\u2019 main components are tomatoes and soy, the texture and flavor of the whites in both versions is spot on, says Crux owner George Thomson. \u201cCustomers are constantly commenting about how what we do is considered \u2018wizardry.\u2019\u201d\n  The process of developing Crux\u2019s vegan eggs \u201cabsolutely consumed\u201d Thomson, who has been vegan for about five years. \u201cI saw people making vegan \u2018fried eggs\u2019 online, and I thought,  I could do that better,\u201d he said. YouTube alone offers many methods. In 2018, Ellie Bullen of the blog Elsa\u2019s Wholesome Life shared a much-imitated video in which she  blended pumpkin into a yellow mixture and then dolloped it onto a circle made of flour and coconut milk. Emmy Cho of Emmymade  riffed on that recipe using eggfruit, the colloquial name for canistel; when it\u2019s ripe, the fruit, which comes from a tree native to Central America,  is compared to the texture of a hard-boiled egg yolk. Where these recipes fall short, though, is that the \u201cyolks\u201d aren\u2019t poppable, but rather a spoonful of sauce atop what is effectively a white pancake.\n   A raw chicken egg yolk is a liquid mixture of protein, fat, water, and minerals that\u2019s encased in a  transparent membrane, which keeps the yolk separate from the albumen that makes up the egg whites. To make a vegan egg yolk that behaves similarly, then, replicating that membrane is crucial.\n  Patented in the 1940s by food scientist William Peschardt, spherification is a technique that traps a liquid in a thin gel membrane. Peschardt suggested it for use in \u201cartificial edible cherries, soft sheets, and the like.\u201d The process works  by mixing an edible liquid that contains no calcium with sodium alginate, and then dropping it into a calcium salt bath. (There\u2019s also  reverse spherification, which involves dripping a calcium-containing substance into an alginate bath.) When the sodium alginate meets the calcium ions,  the ions bind together, giving the drops of liquid a gel skin.\n  Spherification really entered public consciousness in 2003, when the Spanish restaurant El Bulli\u2014which won World\u2019s Best Restaurant the previous year, and every year from 2006 to 2009\u2014 began using it and gained acclaim for dishes like  an \u201colive\u201d made out of olive juice. El Bulli and chef Ferran Adri\u00e0 were leaders in the cooking movement that\u2019s sometimes referred to as \u201cmolecular gastronomy,\u201d though many chefs associated with it use terms like \u201c modernist cuisine.\u201d\n  Credited to physicist Nicholas Kurti and chemist Herv\u00e9 This and dating to 1988,  molecular gastronomy is a field of study that explores the science behind cooking in home and restaurant kitchens. (\u201c Food science,\u201d by comparison, generally refers to the study of industrial food production, safety, and nutrition.) The term was also used\u2014mistakenly,  according to Encyclopedia Britannica\u2014to refer to the use of science to create new dishes and cooking techniques. Thanks to the work of chefs like Adri\u00e0, Heston Blumenthal, and Wylie Dusfresne in the late 1990s to early 2000s, \u201cmolecular gastronomy,\u201d despite the potential misnomer, became synonymous with foods in formats like foams, gels, and spheres.\n  Dufresne, who was known for his love of eggs, even served a  coconut-carrot mixture designed to look like a sunny-side-up egg at his New York City restaurant WD-50, which was  open from 2003 to 2014. (In 2007, Dufresne\u2019s \u201cegg\u201d became the subject of brief food world controversy when  Top Chef\u2019s Marcel Vigneron \u201c ripped [it] off\u201d with his \u201c cyber egg\u201d that was featured in  Wired.)\n  Today, Crux\u2014which is focused on \u201cboundary-pushing vegan food\u201d\u2014uses spherification to turn a tomato-based mixture into its vegan egg yolk. A similar technique using tomatoes was popularized online in a  2019 Insider video about the Los Angeles vegan restaurant  Crossroads Kitchen, which has been serving a tomato yolk  since at least 2016. New Paltz, New York\u2019s  Lagusta\u2019s Luscious Commissary, which opened in 2016, created its own \u201c molecular egg\u201d to serve on top of ramen. But Crossroads Kitchen\u2019s tomato technique got even more attention last year when Buzzfeed\u2019s  Goodful tried it in a video that has almost 4 million views as of this writing. The method is now making the rounds on TikTok: In addition to Crux\u2019s clips, a tomato-based vegan egg appears in  a TikTok posted by the user @oprahwinfrey.car1 earlier this month and which currently has 3.5 million views. Crux also uses spherification with a cashew-based mixture to make the rest of its vegan poached egg.\n  Lisa Kitahara of the food blog  Okonomi Kitchen developed her  vegan egg yolk recipe because she missed the tamago kake gohan, a comfort food of raw egg mixed into hot rice, that she would eat when her family visited Japan every year. She also uses the spherification technique, but instead of tomatoes, which she found \u201ctoo juicy,\u201d she\u2019s found success using squash, carrots, or sweet potatoes to make an egg yolk base that\u2019s smooth and buttery.\n  Another key ingredient in Kitahara\u2019s take on tamago kake gohan is nagaimo, a mountain yam, which she grates raw into her bowl of rice before adding the egg yolk. \u201cIt kind of mimics that slimy texture that eggs have,\u201d she said. She also uses nagaimo in her  vegan take on kaki fry, or Japanese-style fried oysters. In that recipe, nagaimo acts in the place of eggs to bind the mixture she uses to dredge oyster mushrooms, and it also adds a sliminess that\u2019s reminiscent of an oyster from the sea.\n  There\u2019s more to an egg yolk than form, and a common flavor element in many vegan egg recipes including Kitahara\u2019s and Thomson\u2019s is  kala namak, also known as Indian or Himalayan black salt. Unlike  Hawaiian black salts that contain activated charcoal, kala namak  contains sulfur compounds that evoke the smell and flavor of eggs. One of these is hydrogen sulfide,  which is responsible for the smell of eggs, from hunger-inducing to spoiled rotten.\n  Why these techniques aren\u2019t more popular in a commercial or even restaurant sense might be because of the effort that goes into making them. After Thomson developed a successful prototype of his vegan egg, his next challenge was making it on a larger scale, a process that took months. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to make a handful of vegan \u2018poached eggs,\u2019 it\u2019s a whole different game to create thousands of them in a commercial environment,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth the vegan \u2018fried eggs\u2019 and vegan \u2018poached eggs\u2019 take tremendous amounts of energy to create, even after perfecting both methods.\u201d\n  Though Kitahara has put a recipe for her vegan egg yolk on her blog, she plans to continue experimenting with the process. She\u2019d like to eventually tackle a version of  onsen tamago (\u201chot springs eggs\u201d in Japanese),\u00a0 eggs slowly cooked at a temperature below boiling until they\u2019re silky, soft, and custardy. She thinks this could be possible with the use of agar, a common vegetarian alternative to gelatin. \u201cEven now, I&#39;m still very excited to kind of tweak the recipe a bit,\u201d Kitahara said. Perhaps one day, she suggested, she could make a guide to the perfect vegan egg for each person\u2019s preference; she\u2019d like to figure out the right proportions of liquid to root vegetables in her yolk mixture to create options from runny yolks to thicker, more cooked-seeming ones.\n  At Crux, the vegan egg yolks are so accurate that both dishes currently come with a disclaimer to \u201cplease pop eggs with care.\u201d \u201cBefore the warning on the menu, it was a common occurrence for people to underestimate just how realistic they were, and they would end up covered in vegan egg yolk,\u201d Thomson said.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 15:31:41", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u53ef\u53e3,squeezable,\u9e21\u86cb", "title": "\u6324\u538b\uff0c\u53ef\u53e3\u7d20\u98df\u86cb\u86cb\u9ec4\u7684\u79d1\u5b66 ", "title_en": "The Science of the Squeezable, Poppable Vegan Egg Yolk", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kv4xy/the-science-of-the-squeezable-poppable-vegan-egg-yolk", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u53ef\u53e3", "\u9e21\u86cb"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "1e277f1778f9d49c341b6d5cb32bf46a.png", "infoid": 1066848, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7b2c2\u90e8\u5206\u3002C\u7f16\u7a0b\u7b80\u4ecb\uff08#include\uff0c#define\uff0cmain\uff08\uff09\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u8fd0\u7b97\u7b26\uff0c...\u7b49\uff09\n  \u6b64Web\u7f16\u7a0b\u6307\u5357\u542f\u52a8\u4e3aYouTube\u4e0a\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7cfb\u5217\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u901a\u8fc7Patreon\u652f\u6301\u3002\u5728\u60e0\u987e\uff06\uff0334; C\u7f16\u7a0b\uff06\uff0334;\u7b49\u7ea7\u53ca\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff08Patreon\uff09\u8bbf\u95ee\u8fd9\u4e9b\u989d\u5916\u4fe1\u606f\uff1a\n \u72ec\u5bb6\u8bbf\u95ee\u5176\u4f59\u7684\uff06\uff0334;\u7f16\u7a0b\u6307\u5357\uff06\uff0334;\u66f4\u8be6\u7ec6\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u9677\u5165\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\n  \u4e00\u5468\u7684\u5e15\u52d2\u987f\u8bba\u575b\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u5173\u90a3\u5468\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff06\uff0339; s\uff06\uff0334; c\u7f16\u7a0b\uff06\uff0334;\u4e3b\u9898\uff08\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u9700\u8981\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e0b\u6cbf\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u95ee\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff09\n  \u89c6\u9891\u7cfb\u5217\u5b8c\u6210\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u5c06\u7f16\u7a0b\u6307\u5357\u7f16\u8f91\u4e3aA\uff06\uff0334;\u6559\u81ea\u5df1\u7f16\u7a0b\uff06\uff0334;\u901a\u8fc7\u51fa\u7248\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34Lulu\u9884\u8ba2\u3002\u987e\u5ba2\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ee5\u6210\u672c\u8d2d\u4e70\u8fd9\u672c\u4e66 - \uff06\uff0339;\u4ece\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u4e66\u4e2d\u50a8\u84c4\u4e00\u5927\u7b14\u94b1\n  \u6211\u559c\u6b22\u611f\u8c22\u6240\u6709\u652f\u6301\u6211\u7684\u5e15\u52d2\u987f\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\uff0c\u5305\u62ecJason Pittman\uff0cAlexander Shendi\uff0cGustavo Pezzi\uff0cScott Bollinger\uff0cRyan Harris\uff0cRafael Campos\uff0cK Mi\uff0cNikola Markovic BGD\uff0cWade Brainerd\uff0cMike Garcia\uff0cPhilip Espi\uff0c Vlastimil Holer\uff0cDan Mons\uff0cStephen Smogen\uff0cBill Marshall\uff0cPater\uff0cBrett Owen\uff0cRonald Eichler\uff0cTom Dison\uff0cJoe Walker\uff0cMagnus Wild\uff0cKwang Lee\uff0cMitchel Valentino\uff0cTheGreatCodeholio\uff0cB\u00e9renger\uff0cDaniel Monteiro\uff0cMark Eichin\uff0cSparheld International GmbH\uff0c Hallmentum Llc\uff0cEric Leblanc\uff0cLuke Abbott\uff0cJohn Paul Wohlscheid\uff0cSean Dobes\uff0cTom Dearden\uff0cEric Smith\uff0cSuperilu\u548cDwayne\u3002 ", "note_en": "Part 2.

During my early 20s, I lived in the skeptic blogosphere, a mid-2000s constellation of internet communities theoretically organized around highly charismatic bloggers, vloggers, and other intellectuals. In practice, however, these groups were centered on a more basic principle: hostility toward anyone and anything it deemed &#34;irrational.&#34; It was then and is still now a very white, male, and defensive place.\n  It was there that I developed a deep antipathy toward the anti-vaccination movement. It wasn&#39;t that I knew they were wrong about vaccines. It was more than that. I believed myself intellectually and morally superior to those people, and I reinforced that belief each time I left a comment or watched a vlog or republished a snarky article on the subject. I mastered a face, a kind of appalled, disapproving look for any time anybody even broached the subject of vaccine skepticism.\n          I met my wife nine years ago. I wanted to take up swing dancing and decided to take a private class to get over some of my anxiety. She was the teacher who picked up the phone when I called.\n  I was immediately attracted to her, but at the time she was engaged to her dancing partner, the father of her daughter.\n  So at first we built a platonic friendship. We spent time together. We bonded over our mutual interest in dancing. I had known her for more than a year the first time she mentioned that her daughter was not vaccinated.\n  What do you do, then, when someone you believe is both smart and sensible comes to a conclusion you find completely wrong? Does that person stop being smart at that precise moment?\n  My time reading (arrogant) skeptic blogs had convinced me of my moral and intellectual superiority. I believed that  because I was a smart, sensible, and empathetic person I could see the value of vaccines. Yet here this woman was. I knew she wasn&#39;t dumb \u2014 in fact, I thought she was very insightful. I knew she wasn&#39;t dangerous or conspiratorial \u2014 we had talked for days about how we care about people, and the society we live in, and what it means to be human. I already trusted her.\n  Did I have to completely reassess my opinion of this person? Did I have to examine my own biases and mental caricatures, decide that anti-vaxxers  are people too?\n  Well, no. I did what most people did: opted for cognitive dissonance. I decided it wasn&#39;t worth getting into a fight over, that she could be my friend and have weird opinions about vaccines at the same time. Even as she broke up with her partner, and I broke up with mine, and we found ourselves spending a lot of time together, I ignored the issue. The subject of vaccines came up once or twice over dinners, but so what? I could see she loved and cared deeply for her daughter. She was someone I admired and respected and was beginning to love. Vaccines didn&#39;t get in the way.\n  And, of course, I believed that if we spent enough time together, I&#39;d eventually change her mind.\n      This is the beating heart of any real discussion about anti-vaxxers. It&#39;s impossible to understand their position without considering the amount of fear that goes into the anti-vaccine narrative, and considering how people construct and deal with fear.\n    Now, you might think that a fear is a fear and public health is something else \u2014 and you might be right. That&#39;s the rational point of view. But then, how rational are your own fears?\n  Maybe you&#39;re afraid of heights. Maybe it&#39;s spiders. In either case, you&#39;re lucky: Coping with your fear the way most people do \u2014 avoidance \u2014 doesn&#39;t come at a cost to others. But vaccines only work when everyone buys in. Public health depends on anti-vaxxers confronting their greatest fears for the benefit of others.\n  For people who don&#39;t share their fear, it&#39;s very easy and convenient to demand that anti-vaxxers just suck it up and take the shot. I wish they would, too. But we&#39;ll never get there by bullying them, by insulting and demeaning them and refusing to take the fact of their fear seriously, even if there isn&#39;t much that&#39;s serious in its content.\n  That&#39;s hard to do. Have you ever tried to stare a loved one into the eye and tell her you are going to put her child in danger?\n  Despite initially avoiding the subject, I decided, after we were married, that I should convince my wife to vaccinate her daughter. Vaccines are good, after all. Vaccines are safe. Measles outbreaks had been on the news \u2014 what better time to raise the subject?\n  But when I did, I realized that from her perspective, all of my confrontational reasoning sounded like me asking to point a gun at her daughter and have her trust that it was full of blanks. Looking into her eyes, I realized her trust in me was threatened. She asked why I would do that to a child. All of my insistence that vaccines are safe didn&#39;t matter. Go tell arachnophobic parents that you must put spiders on their child because society depends on it, and see how that goes. The benefits of getting the shot, expressed in the abstract, simply could not overpower the immediate, disarming fear.\n  So I backed down. The anti-vax position was not a deal breaker for me, but suggesting that we should expose her daughter to grave dangers for no good reason was a deal breaker for my wife. I loved my wife. I had no desire to end things. Yes, I think it was very important for her daughter to receive vaccines \u2014 but it&#39;s not as if my wife would have changed her mind over a breakup fight.\n  I backed down and resolved to have that conversation in less confrontational terms when the opportunity arose.\n    My wife is one of the smartest, most sensible people I know. So what do smart, sensible people do when they perceive a threat? They do the smart, sensible thing: take precautions and warn others.\n    Again, it&#39;s easy to dismiss the worries of anti-vaxxers as irrational and chalk up their activism to paranoid behavior, but this misses a crucial point: The reasoning, once you accept the big, unsubstantiated premise, is valid. It isn&#39;t even  that far-fetched, if you don&#39;t think about it too hard: There are some heartbreaking precedents that feed this logic. Lead paint, tobacco, bloodletting \u2014 every time we feel the urge to reply, &#34;But vaccines are safe, everyone knows that,&#34; we ought to remember that the same sentence has been said, earnestly and confidently, about things that absolutely were hazardous.\n  Go tell arachnophobic parents that you must put spiders on their child because society depends on it, and see how that goes\n  If you&#39;ve come to believe that vaccines are dangerous, then anti-vax behavior follows almost rationally. If we want to reach these people, dismissing their logic as ridiculous or fringe is the worst strategy. It plays right into the anti-vaccination narrative: that they are the &#34;only sane ones,&#34; warning the careless masses about a very real and hidden danger.\n  My wife (and her family) sincerely believes that though her worries are being recognized as irrational, they aren&#39;t. It&#39;s easy to imagine how the very first person to notice the dangers of something ubiquitous, like lead, was dismissed by her peers as irrationally afraid \u2014 and to imagine you might be one of these people. The first anti-lead folks were called cranks \u2014 until they were proven right.\n  My point isn&#39;t that the anti-vaxxers might be right. They&#39;re not. My point is that once you believe something untrue, it&#39;s very easy to keep rationalizing that belief. It&#39;s very easy to dismiss your critics as shortsighted. And when you&#39;re constantly attacked, it&#39;s natural to make your resilience part of your identity, to become even more committed to maintaining it.\n  People are not essays, where you can go back to a previous paragraph and undermine the priors through careful, unperturbed dissection. People talk, and people balk. My wife would not stand to have me pick her apart like she is a problem that needs to be solved; her priors \u2014 like everyone else&#39;s \u2014 are part of her identity. All of us have beliefs of this sort; it&#39;s just that most of us can get away with them more easily. We need to stop seeing anti-vaxxers as people who can be persuaded to abandon a bad idea, and instead as people we&#39;re asking to abandon a part of themselves \u2014 people whose defensive sense of identity we&#39;ve encouraged with bad tactics.\n      A sense of identity isn&#39;t the only thing that makes anti-vaxxers impervious to confrontational argument. If you take a deeply controversial position, especially in the beginning, you won&#39;t last long without a strong support system. Unfortunately, fear sells \u2014 and there&#39;s always someone willing to give you that support for a price.\n  Evidently, people who don&#39;t trust or value conventional medicine still get sick. In Canada, where I live, socialized health care covers almost all conventional health-care costs, but there is a serious private market for people who would rather get their treatments from alternative sources. These alternative sources  can do some good: Sick people need care, and some amount of care is usually better than no care at all. But the alternative health industry is also a business, and at its worst, this is how the business works:  Articles about children turning &#34;autistic&#34; after a shot are circulated by authors selling books, websites selling ads, and merchants selling cures. When you&#39;re in the business of selling treatments against a subsidized competitor, your pitch needs to be emotive, essential. It needs to appeal to the values of your audience. Since there is a real economy hinging on people not trusting conventional medicine, its actors churn out sensationalist scare pieces by the truckload, which validates the preexisting anxieties of anti-vaxxers ad nauseam \u2014 and drive them into the arms of the people willing to sell them a solution.\n    Back when my wife and I were just friends, I met her sister a couple of times. She is a very pleasant, completely agreeable, and naturally sociable person. I really had no reason to be anything less than friendly to her. Then my wife told me that her sister is a naturopath who studied the toxic effects of vaccines &#34;extensively.&#34;\n  My sister-in-law is also a big part of my wife&#39;s support network. When my wife is second-guessing herself about vaccines \u2014 like when her daughter&#39;s father raised the issue after their separation \u2014 she turns to her sister. Her sister is even deeper in the movement that she is \u2014 she&#39;s a provider of alternative medicines by trade \u2014 and when they talk, my wife comes away more sure of the anti-vax worldview. Again: This isn&#39;t a strange behavior. How many times have you wondered about something important, only to be reassured by a conversation with a loved one?\n  Of course, it&#39;s not uniquely devious for anti-vaxxers to seek like-minded people to validate their views; we all do it. One of the reasons I like many of the newspapers and magazines I like, for instance, is because they tell me things I already think about foreign policy, urbanism, feminism, and race \u2014 we all suffer from confirmation bias to some extent. But unlike more ordinary biases, the alternative medicine racket is completely unchecked; by definition, it eschews mainstream checks on its theories and practices. It cashes in on encouraging the isolation and dependence of its participants. This is an environment in which every hypothesis is given equal weight, and all of them come packaged with some kind of product recommendation.\n  Without a profitable industry, anti-vax beliefs might not survive long. But again, what do we do? The monolithic media presence of the vaccination narrative gives skeptics an &#34;assaulted and oppressed&#34; outlook that encourages its members to seek out corners that coddle their worldviews. Those corners then sell them back their own biases \u2014 and they become even more confident that they&#39;re right.\n    I decided to write this piece after it was revealed that Pandemrix, a vaccine designed to combat swine flu, was causing narcolepsy in children. As Julia Belluz pointed out  on this site, the 2013 discovery was hardly covered by the media despite real and demonstrated side effects \u2014 precisely the kind of behavior anti-vaxxers suspect is happening with all vaccines.\n  I keep an eye out for stories like this, one that could allow my wife and me to discuss vaccination in nonconfrontational terms. A story like Pandemrix allowed me to engage her in good faith, to admit that sometimes medicine makes bad calls and that the media can be complicit. I brought it up to my wife to show that I care about her worries, that I don&#39;t think they are beyond the pale. When easing somebody&#39;s fears, love is rarely enough \u2014 empathy is needed, especially when you want to persuade. Refusing to engage in any open-minded discussion, to concede that things can go wrong, to admit that it&#39;s possible we don&#39;t know everything: That kind of condescension had gotten me nowhere with my wife and her daughter no closer to vaccinations. It hasn&#39;t gotten the broader fight against anti-vaxxers very far either.\n  When easing somebody&#39;s fears, love is rarely enough \u2014 empathy is needed, especially when you want to persuade\n  A lack of personal investment is, as it happens, what led to my wife&#39;s initial rejection of vaccines: She had a very unfortunate run-in with a complacent MD in her late teens, while she was going through a lot of pain physically and mentally.\n  It started with a drug-induced psychotic breakdown. She grew up in something of a broken home, with an absent father, an addict mother, and a violent stepfather \u2014 an environment where drugs were easy to come by and hard to ignore. At 17, she smoked something weird and felt herself quite literally losing it. Hallucinations. Panic attacks. Nausea and heart palpitations. After a grueling week of recovering from the episode, she did the normal thing and took herself to a doctor.\n  She got out with a prescription and an unshakable feeling that this doctor, and his clinic, and the government that paid for his services, did not care at all about her concerns, her needs, and her fears. That she was a problem that could be solved with a couple of pills. That the fear she had felt for her sanity was not respected, not even considered. That the solution to her drug problem was  more drugs.\n    This is not a breach of trust that can be restored by telling her vaccines are safe.\n  It&#39;s obvious and painful that all human systems are going to fail at some places due to human imperfection. It&#39;s probably impossible to force all doctors to be nice and considerate people.\n  Maybe my wife would have felt just as abandoned even if the doctor did everything right at that moment. But knowing that for many anti-vaxxers there is a root cause \u2014 something that led them to mistrust medicine and then wind up in a feedback loop that reinforced that mistrust \u2014 is vital to pushing back. I do think minds can be changed and hearts can be won, but I&#39;ve made my peace: Only love, patience, and empathy will make inroads. Treat anti-vaxxers kindly, if only because it&#39;s pretty hard to feel persecuted when your adversaries are being kind. This is the road I chose, and I am happy to share my life with a person who challenges and inspires me. Someone whom, a mere decade ago, I would have considered a dangerous lunatic.\n  And then, last week, her daughter asked if she would be getting shots this year.\n  &#34;Not with your classmates,&#34; my wife said. &#34;But yes, it&#39;s time. We&#39;ll schedule an appointment with our new family doctor.&#34;\n        First Person is Vox&#39;s home for compelling, provocative narrative essays. Do you have a story to share?

based corporates like ASML and Philips have been eyeing initiatives across Europe and applying what they\u2019ve learned to the region\u2019s strategy. Philips launched in Eindhoven in 1891 and played no small part in the municipality\u2019s ambitions to become a tech hub.\n Eindhoven produces a high number of patents per year considering its small population and has been home to an inordinate number of hardware startups. The local High Tech Campus has a high hardware focus, for instance.\n  Our survey respondents consider the city strong in areas like photonics, robotics, medical devices, materials science, deep tech, automotive tech, sustainability tech, medtech, Big Data, hardware and precision engineering. They are looking for more mature startups and scaleups focused on AI and hard tech.\n Eindhoven is considered weaker in fintech and consumer products, and it exists in a small region with limited global visibility.\n Over the next five years, one respondent said, \u201cEindhoven will have evolved to the Netherlands\u2019 second-largest tech ecosystem, behind Amsterdam. On a European scale, Eindhoven will have entered the top 10.\u201d\n     What industry sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by?

What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?\n High-tech systems and materials, the real high-tech and deep tech stuff that either leads to scientific breakthroughs or turns scientific breakthroughs into companies. Lithography makes a major contribution to that, as well as medical devices and production technologies.\n   What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city?

What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?\n The pros are high-tech systems, collaboration culture and excellent startup ecosystem; The cons are that it\u2019s a small region with limited visibility globally.\n   What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What\u2019s their focus?\n  With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out or will others move in?\n Others will move in! Housing is extremely expensive but the demand for a skilled workforce is extremely high. If people move to surrounding areas, within 30 km, housing prices skyrocket all over.\n Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc.)?\\\n  Where do you see your city\u2019s tech scene in five years\u2019 time?\n Leading worldwide in several technology areas, mainly, high-precision, roll-to-roll processing atomic layer deposition, material handling, industry 4.0, silicon processing equipment.\n  What industry sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?\n The region is strong in deep tech, automotive tech, sustainability tech, medtech, Big Data, hardware and precision engineering. Most excited by sustainability tech and deep tech. The region is weak in fintech.\n   What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What\u2019s their focus?\n Conservative, non-risk-taking \u2014 there are so many subsidies they don\u2019t need to take risks, so once the tech risk is gone, they are good, but they are not global enough; hardware.\n With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out or will others move in?\n Hardware is hands-on \u2014 people are still moving in!

What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?\n The region is strong in deep tech and health. I\u2019m excited about opportunities for cooperation between different companies. It\u2019s weak in seed investment.\n   What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What\u2019s their focus?\n  With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out or will others move in?\n They will stay; working from home has some benefits but meeting people in an inspiring environment gives the best synergy.\n Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc.)?\n  Where do you see your city\u2019s tech scene in five years\u2019 time?\n   What industry sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?\n The region is strong in building sustainable and resilient cities and a platform between cities/society and tech market.\n  Digital Toolbox (a Serendipity spinoff), Amber (mobility), Active Esports Arena and other portfolio companies of LUMO Labs.\n What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What\u2019s their focus?\n Through LUMO Labs, there is a focus on societal investments; the rest is investment in high tech due to the big industries (VDLK, ASML, NXP, Phillips).\n With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out or will others move in?\n  Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc.)?\n A combination of accelerators (LUMO Labs, HighTechXL, Braventure) and Brainport (ecosystem management) supported by the Eindhoven University of Technology and big corporates.\n Where do you see your city\u2019s tech scene in five years\u2019 time?\n Leading in the world on societal/systemic change \u2014 moving from high-tech toward impact (more software and digitization).\n  What industry sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in?

What is it weak in?\n It\u2019s strong in high-tech equipment, hardware, photonics, additive manufacturing, lighting, electronics, semiconductor technology and health tech, and weak in consumer products and apps.\n   What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What\u2019s their focus?\n  With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out or will others move in?\n They will stay. Eindhoven is a hot spot with many cultures, international tech community and great infrastructure, while it feels like a village.\n Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc.)?\n  Where do you see your city\u2019s tech scene in five years\u2019 time?\n   What industry sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?\n The Eindhoven ecosystem is really strong in the sectors of mobility, smart city and energy. I\u2019m most excited about smart city. This is our focus sector and it is the embodiment of ecosystem collaboration with impact solutions.\n   What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What\u2019s their focus?\n The investment scene is getting better. They are increasingly realizing that deep tech takes time and needs to be nurtured, but the potential impact is massive and can have a dramatic effect on the entire ecosystem. There are still relatively few early-stage impact drive investors. LUMO Labs is leading the pack on that front.\n With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out or will others move in?\n I think more people will stay as the need to move to Amsterdam as the tech hub of the Netherlands diminishes, giving Eindhoven a boost to strengthen its own ecosystem, which will in turn make even more people stay and attract people to move in the city. As a result, COVID-19 will have a positive effect on Eindhoven\u2019s tech ecosystem, I believe.\n Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc.)?\n  Where do you see your city\u2019s tech scene in five years\u2019 time?\n In five years, I believe Eindhoven will have evolved to Netherlands\u2019 second-largest tech ecosystem, behind Amsterdam.

It was started in 1858 by Brighton\u2019s Guardians more as a cost cutting exercise, than as an attempt to break a world record, but it did break a record and still remains as the deepest \u201cHAND DUG\u201d well in the world.\n Plans for a new workhouse  Back in 1858, plans were in hand to build a new workhouse at the top of what is now  Elm Grove and to add to it an industrial school for juveniles some 2 miles away at Warren Farm. The aim of the school would be to teach the misplaced youth of the town \u201cthe habits of industry\u201d and relieve them from \u201cthe bane of pauperism.\u201d\n The expense of pumped water  However, the expense of having pumped water supplied from the local waterworks, then on the corner of  Lewes Road (now Saunders Park) was considered prohibitive, so the Guardians decided that they would construct a single well for both properties and augment the workforce with labour from the  Dyke Road Workhouse. In their opinion, making relief for the more able pauper, young or old and regardless of gender, conditional on some of the destitute undertaking an aspect of the well\u2019s construction would reduce labour costs and indirectly add a further deterrent to anyone considering applying to the workhouse for poor relief.\n The initial plans were not successful  initial plan was to sink a 6 ft wide, brick lined shaft down some 400 feet to the subterranean water table. All the soil dug out would be placed in buckets and hand winched to a platform at the top of the shaft where it could be disposed of. After 2 years of digging, the shaft had only reached a depth of some 438 feet, but no water had been found. Fearing that they had just missed the supply, the contractor gave instructions for a lateral chamber to be driven some 30 ft northwards, but this too yeilded nothing. Further lateral tunnels were driven westwards and eastwards, but none of them were successful. Failing to acknowledge defeat, the Guardians sanctioned the construction of a further 4 ft wide shaft at the end of the eastern tunnel.\n Digging\u00a0done for 24 hours a day  Work continued for several more years with men working 24 hours a day just by candle light in appalling conditions. Many removed their clothes and worked naked for within the confines of a 4 ft circle teams of men had to dig, load buckets and lay bricks. Winchmen stood on tiny platforms cut into the side of the shaft, passing spoil up and bricks down as the shaft continued forever downwards. One winchman actually plunged to his death.\n Escalating costs caused concern  Above ground the Guardians began to bicker about the expense, for the Woodingdean Well was now costing the local ratepayer some \u00a390 a week and jests about it were frequent. Some said the town was constructing an alternative route to the Antipodes, whereas others described the whole thing as \u201ca great bore\u201d!\n The final break through  At the change of the evening shifts on Sunday 16th March 1862, the bricklayer noticed that the thin crust of earth he was standing on was being slowly pushed upwards like a giant piston. Scrambling up the numerous ladders to each winchman\u2019s platform, he and the others quickly vacated the shaft. It must have been a difficult task for the well had now been sunk to such an amazing depth their successful exit took some 45 minutes. Suddenly with a roar, the piston head crumbled and tools, buckets and ladders flooded up the shaft. Water had at last been found. It had taken over 4 years backbreaking work for a labour force which included many Brighton paupers, to hand dig a shaft some 1285 feet deep (850 of which were below sea level) without the aid of machines.\n An incredible achievement  To put this incredible achievement, distance and the danger into perspective, I can think of no greater analogy than that used in P Mercer &amp; D Holland\u2019s \u201cHunns Mere Pit\u201d which I have interpreted using my own illustration. The Woodingdean Well\u2019s depth into the earth was greater than the height of the Empire State Building. Imagine climbing that building in darkness on a twice daily basis, using just a series of rickety ladders, let alone in a panic situation with water flooding up beneath you and your colleagues!\n  I consent to my name and e-mail address being stored along with this comment, and to the website editors communicating with me by e-mail about the comment if necessary.

And if you take a look at commencement addresses from the past, you\u2019ll see a glimpse of what people in power told privileged young people to believe in and sketches of what the future could be, which we can now consider next to the reality of what came next. Lapham\u2019s Quarterly  is revisiting the history of giving advice to graduates and others in the process of acquiring knowledge or skills.\n  The Book of Ecclesiastes is one of the biblical \u201cwisdom\u201d books and belongs to an ancient literary tradition, beginning in Sumer and Babylonia, of recording the advice of sages. The word  Ecclesiastes derives from the Greek  ekklesiastes, or \u201cone who addresses an assembly,\u201d which is a rough translation of the Hebrew word  Qohelet (also  Koheleth), meaning \u201cpreacher\u201d or \u201cteacher.\u201d Qohelet is the name  given in the text by the apparent author of Ecclesiastes. He also claims to be a king of Jerusalem and the son of David. If that is his true parentage, Qohelet was King Solomon, the tenth-century-  ruler of the Israelites. Jewish and Christian theologians have traditionally followed this attribution by placing Ecclesiastes between the Song of Solomon and the Book of Proverbs, Solomon\u2019s other biblical writings, in the Old Testament. Yet the text\u2019s Aramaic loanwords suggest it was composed in the third century  , after Solomon\u2019s kingdom was divided and Jerusalem became one of the colonies of the Achaemenid Empire.\n Qohelet was a deeply cynical thinker, perhaps because of the diminished state of the Israelites. He describes a world in which success and happiness are not guaranteed, where an individual is largely powerless in the face of human greed, fallibility, and suffering. His advice for readers is to accept the futility of their lives and welcome the knowledge that all human actions are \u201cvanity\u201d or \u201cvapor.\u201d He suggests (perhaps influenced by the Greek philosophy of Epicureanism) that the best course of action is to pursue tranquility and pleasure:\n Therefore eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart. God has already given his approval to thy deeds. At all times be thy garments white, and let oil not be lacking for thy head. Enjoy life with the woman of thy love all the days of thy vain life that God has given thee under the sun. That is thy portion in life and the compensation for thy toil under the sun. Whatever thou can afford with thy substance do, for there is no activity, or reckoning, or knowledge, and no wisdom in Sheol.  1\n Since the first century, scholars have debated why Qohelet\u2019s pessimistic meditation on human life was included in the Bible. Morris Jastrow Jr., an expert on Semitic languages at the University of Pennsylvania, noted in his 1919 translation, \u201cIt is a strange book to have slipped into a sacred collection.\u201d Jastrow set out to produce a new translation of Qohelet\u2019s words, believing that centuries of adaptation and reframing had resulted in a different work than its creator had intended; he was determined to give twentieth-century readers a new impression of a very old text:\n In presenting Qohelet in a new garb, minus the trimmings which were attached to the original composition, it is my hope to make a remarkable literary production more intelligible than is possible by reading it in any of our present-day translations of the Old Testament, which are all modeled on the classic \u201cauthorized\u201d version of 1611, and which all assume the book to be a literary unit in its present form. In other words, I have tried to give the reader the book of Qohelet in its original form, as nearly as that is at present possible.\n Writers from  William Shakespeare to  Edith Wharton have paraphrased Qohelet\u2019s words, and  Leo Tolstoy turned to Ecclesiastes during a midlife crisis of faith, writing in   A Confession that his doubts began with a single realization: \u201cWhat am I?\u2014A part of the infinite. In those few words lies the whole problem.\u201d\n   What gain has a man of all his toil, \tWhich he toils under the sun? \tGeneration comes and generation goes, but the earth remains forever. \tThe sun rises and the sun sets, \tAnd to his rising place he returns. \tAround to the south and circling to the north, \tAround and around goes the wind, \tAnd on its circuits the wind returns. \tAll streams flow into the sea, \tBut the sea is not full. \tTo the place whither the streams flow, \tFrom there they flow back again. \tEverything is wearied, \tBeyond human utterance, \tBeyond sight and hearing. \tWhat has been is that which shall be; \tAnd what has happened is that which shall happen, \tSo that there is nothing new under the sun.\n If something occurs of which one says, \u201cSee, this is new\u201d\u2014ages before us it has already happened. Former occurrences are not recorded, and later occurrences also shall not be remembered by the ages that are to come.\n I, Qohelet, was king over Israel in Jerusalem, and I applied my mind to seek and explore everything under the sun\u2014a sorry business which God has given the children of men for their affliction. I saw all that happened under the sun\u2014and behold it was all vanity and chasing after wind.\n Now I thought to myself,  I have become great and acquired much more than anyone who reigned before me over Jerusalem. My mind was stored with very much wisdom and knowledge. So I set out to experience frivolity and foolishness, though I knew that this, too, was chasing after wind. I said to myself,  Come, I\u2019ll make a test of pleasure and of having a good time, but alas! This also turned out to be vanity. Of sport, I was led to conclude that it was madness, and of joy\u2014what does it accomplish! I made up my mind to stimulate my body with wine and to pursue folly, in order to ascertain whether this was a good way for the children of men to spend the days of their lives.\n I undertook great works. I acquired houses; I planted vineyards; I made gardens and parks. I planted in them all kinds of fruit trees, I made pools of water to irrigate the sprouting forest. I purchased slaves and handmaidens, and had a household of dependents, besides having possessions of cattle and flocks in large number, more than anyone before me in Jerusalem. I gathered also silver and gold, royal treasures, and provinces; I got singers and dancing maidens and all the delights of the children of men.\n So I became great, in excess of anyone who was before me in Jerusalem. I did not withhold anything that my eyes desired, I did not deny myself any pleasure, for I rejoiced in all my toil, and this was my portion of all my toil. But when I looked on all what my hands had wrought and on what I had toiled for\u2014all indeed seemed vanity and chasing after wind. Nothing seemed worthwhile under the sun.\n So I made a test of madness and folly, for what can any man do who comes after a king beyond what he has already done? And yet it seemed to me that perhaps wisdom  has an advantage over folly, insofar as light is better than darkness. But then I realized that there is one and the same fate for all, and I reflected that the fate of the fool will also overtake me. Why then should I be overwise? I concluded that this also is vanity. For of the wise man, as of the fool, there is no permanent record. In the days to come everything is forgotten. And see how the wise man dies just as the fool!\n So I hated life. All that happened under the sun seemed evil to me since all was vanity and chasing after wind. I hated that I must leave all that I had toiled for under the sun to one who comes after me. A man who toils with wisdom, knowledge, and integrity must hand it over as an inheritance to one who has not toiled for it\u2014surely this is vanity and a great evil. What has a man of all his toil and of his painstaking efforts under the sun, since all his days are pains and his ambition a vexation, with no rest for his mind even at night? Surely this is vanity.\n There is nothing better for a man than to eat and to drink and to enjoy himself for his toil; it seems to me that such is the will of God. Everything has its appointed time, and there is a time for every occurrence under the sun. There is a time to be born, and a time to die. There is a time for planting, and a time for uprooting. What profit, then, has the worker of his toil?\n I have observed every ambition which God has given the children of men for their affliction. He has given them a grasp of the whole world without the possibility on the part of man to fathom the work which God has made from the beginning to the end. I realized that there is nothing better for a man than to be happy and to enjoy himself in his life, and that every man who eats and drinks and has a good time in all his toil enjoys a gift of God. I realized that whatever God does is forever, to which one cannot add and from which one cannot take away. Whatever has been has been before, and what is to be has already been.\n I saw under the sun in the place of justice wickedness, and where the righteous should have been the wicked was. I reflected that God permits this in the case of children of men to test them and to show that they are beasts. For the fate of the children of men and the fate of the beast is the same. As this one dies, so is the death of that, and there is the same spirit to all. Man has no advantage over the beast, for all is vanity. All go to one place. All are of the dust and all return to dust. Who knows whether the spirit of the children of men mounts up and the spirit of the beast goes down? It appeared to me that there is nothing better for man than to enjoy himself. That is his portion\u2014who can help him to see what shall be after him?\n I considered all the oppressions practiced under the sun, and the tears of the oppressed without anyone to console them, and the violence of their oppressors with no comforter in sight! And I praised these long since dead more than those still living; better than both is the one who has not yet been, as he has not seen the evil happenings under the sun. I considered that all toil and all honest work is merely due to man\u2019s zeal against his neighbor\u2014surely this is vanity and chasing after wind. Better a handful in quiet than two handsful in toil and chasing after wind. And I further considered the vanity that there is under the sun. There is a single man without a mate, without a son or brother, yet toiling without end, and with an eye never satisfied by his wealth. For whom then should I toil and deprive myself of a good time? Surely this is vanity and a sorry business.\n Better is the child of humble birth and wise than an old king who is a fool and unable to take care of himself. For through a rebellion one may come to rule, even though one is born poor in one\u2019s own kingdom. I saw all the living under the sun flocking to the side of the child, who was to stand in his place. There was no end to all the people, yet those that come after will not rejoice in him\u2014now surely this is vanity and chasing after wind.\n Observe thy pilgrimages to the house of God but draw nigh to hear, rather than to have fools offer a sacrifice, for they do not know enough to do any harm. Be not rash with thy mouth, and be not led hastily to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven and thou art upon earth. Therefore, let thy words be few. If thou  does make a vow to God, do not defer paying it. Whatever thou vows, pay! It is better not to vow than to vow and not pay. Let not thy mouth bring sin upon thee, and do not say before God that it was a slip. Why arouse God\u2019s anger and destroy thy own handiwork?\n A multitude of dreams results in many foolish words, for a dream comes through too much business, and a fool\u2019s voice is heard in many words. If thou sees the oppression of the poor, and justice and righteousness in the country defrauded, do not be amazed at the occurrence, for there is some \u201cguardian\u201d higher up and still higher ones above this one, and overtopping them all is the king.\n  A sore evil that I have seen under the sun is riches hoarded by the owner, and when that fortune is lost through a bad venture, the son begotten by him has nothing. He cannot carry anything that he has acquired by his toil away with him. Surely this  is a sore evil, that just as he came, so he goes. Therefore, what profit is it to him that he toils for the wind and that he spends all his days in saving and in constant worry and sickness and distress?\n It seems to me the thing that is good and proper is to eat, drink, and to have a good time with all one\u2019s toil under the sun during the span of life which God has allotted to one, for that is his portion. Every man to whom God has given riches and possessions and who has the power to enjoy it and to take his portion and to be happy in his toil\u2014this is a gift of God. For he should remember that life is short and that God approves of joy.\n There is an evil I have observed under the sun and it bears heavily on mankind\u2014a man to whom God has given riches and possessions and superfluity with nothing lacking of anything that he might wish for, but to whom God has not given the power to enjoy it, so that a stranger enjoys it\u2014this surely is vanity and a sore evil.\n If a man begets a hundred children and lives many years, be his life ever so long, and he does not get his fill of joy out of it\u2014I say that the abortion is happier than he. Even though it comes into vanity, moves in darkness, and with darkness its name is covered and it has never seen the sun nor has known anything\u2014yet this is preferable to the other. And though a man lives a thousand years twice told and has not had a good time\u2014do not all go to one place?\n What advantage has a wise man over a fool, or the poor man who by his knowledge sets an example to the living? Better is enjoyment than longing\u2014though this also is vanity and chasing after wind.\n Whatever is has long since been determined and what is has been fixed. Man cannot contend with what is stronger than himself. Since many possessions merely increase vanity, what advantage are they to man? For who knows what is good for a man during the span of his life of vanity? And though he spends his life like a shadow, is there anyone who can tell man who is to be after him under the sun?\n  1 Sheol is the Hebrew underworld, described in the Bible as \u201cthe land of gloom and deep darkness\u201d (Job 10:21).  \u21a9\n  Read the other entries in our series:  Lewis H. Lapham,  Frederick Douglass,  Virginia Gildersleeve, and  Kurt Vonnegut.\n  Qohelet is the attributed author of Ecclesiastes, an Old Testament book of wisdom literature. As the narrator of the book refers to himself as \u201cthe son of David, king in Jerusalem,\u201d some readers have identified Ecclesiastes\u2019 author as Solomon, while others caution against equating the narrator with the writer of the text.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 13:22:40", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6559\u4f1a,wind", "title": "\u98ce\u540e\u8ffd\u9010\uff1a\u91cd\u65b0\u63a0\u593a\u6559\u4f1a\u7684\u4e66 ", "title_en": "Chasing After Wind: Reframing the Book of Ecclesiastes", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/chasing-after-wind", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6559\u4f1a", "wind"]}]
