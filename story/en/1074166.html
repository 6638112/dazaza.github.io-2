Without the ZX Spectrum, the games industry – at least in the UK and certain other European countries – would certainly not be the behemoth it is today.</p><p>1982年4月23日，总部位于剑桥的辛克莱研究院（Sinclair Research）公布了其最新产品，40年后，其影响力和历史地位再怎么强调也不为过。如果没有ZX频谱，游戏产业——至少在英国和某些其他欧洲国家——肯定不会成为今天的庞然大物。</p><p>  Looking back from a world of smartphones and  Xboxes, it’s astonishing that such a commercially successful product could have happened with this unglamorous and flawed piece of equipment. Yes, I’m a Speccy fan through and through, cut me and I bleed red, yellow, green and cyan, in that order. But even I readily admit that the home computer had its drawbacks, its imperfections and its idiosyncrasies. In truth, the ZX Spectrum was far from perfect; but that was all part of its appeal. Oh, and the fact it was cheap.</p><p>回顾智能手机和Xbox的世界，令人惊讶的是，这样一款商业上成功的产品竟然能与这台乏味且有缺陷的设备结合在一起。是的，我是一个彻头彻尾的怪癖，切割我，我流血红，黄，绿和青色，按顺序。但就连我也欣然承认，家用电脑也有它的缺点、缺陷和特质。事实上，ZX光谱远非完美；但这正是其吸引力的一部分。哦，事实上它很便宜。</p><p> Very cheap, actually, when compared to rivals of the time. Aware that home computing was a dreadfully expensive business, out of the reach of the average family, Sir Clive Sinclair devised a plan to produce a low-budget micro that, like the television and VCR, would form a central part of a family’s entertainment – and open up computing to everybody. The Spectrum’s great rivals, the Commodore 64 and BBC Micro Model B both retailed for over £300, almost £1000 in today’s money; when the Sinclair computer appeared in 1982, it was priced at just £125 for the 16K version with another fifty quid getting you a whopping 48K. To many families, often working on the assumption that computers were a passing fad and ‘just for kids’, it was a no-brainer.</p><p>与当时的竞争对手相比，实际上非常便宜。克莱夫·辛克莱尔爵士意识到家庭计算是一项极其昂贵的业务，普通家庭无法企及，因此他设计了一项计划，生产一款低预算的微型计算机，与电视和录像机一样，将成为家庭娱乐的核心部分，并向所有人开放计算。该频谱的最大竞争对手Commodore 64和BBC Micro Model B的零售价均超过300英镑，以今天的价格计算几乎为1000英镑；1982年，辛克莱电脑问世时，16K版本的售价仅为125英镑，再加上50英镑，你就可以得到48K。对于许多家庭来说，这是一件轻而易举的事，因为他们常常以为电脑只是一时的时尚，而且“只适合孩子”。</p><p>  The price enabled Sinclair to get a foothold into homes around the UK and Europe; unfortunately for the man behind the machine, it wasn’t for the broad and noble purposes he was hoping for. As with most other computers of the time, it was the games that sold the ZX Spectrum, and in these pre-Xbox and  PlayStation times, the Sinclair computer represented the best and cheapest way for kids to play videogames at home. One such wide-eyed youngster was Martyn Carroll, former editor of  Retro Gamer magazine and a games journalist specialising in the vintage Micro. “[The Spectrum] was less expensive than most computers at the time, yet in many ways it was more capable,” he says. “The sound was awful and the colours clashed, but in the right hands the Spectrum was a contender, a diminutive underdog that punched above its weight.”</p><p>这一价格使辛克莱得以在英国和欧洲各地的住宅中站稳脚跟；不幸的是，对于机器背后的人来说，这并不是为了他所希望的广泛而崇高的目的。和当时的大多数其他电脑一样，ZX频谱是由游戏销售的。在Xbox和PlayStation之前的时代，辛克莱电脑代表了孩子们在家玩电子游戏的最好和最便宜的方式。马丁·卡罗尔（Martyn Carroll）就是这样一个睁大眼睛的年轻人，他曾是《复古玩家》（Retro Gamer）杂志的编辑，也是一名专门研究复古微型游戏的游戏记者。他说：“[频谱]比当时的大多数计算机便宜，但在许多方面它的功能更强。”。“声音很糟糕，颜色也不协调，但在右手中，光谱是一个竞争者，一个小个子弱者，打出了超乎其体重的拳。”</p><p>  Carroll makes a couple of excellent points here. Despite – maybe, because – of its flaws, the Spectrum grew into an outstanding success, eventually selling five million units. The computer’s distinctive rubber keys became the object of mirth for rivals, often derogatorily dubbed ‘dead flesh keys’. And there was the attribute clash, that unfortunate bleeding of colours that could render games a chaotic multicoloured mess. Yet Spectrum fans, soon to become part of the bedroom coder culture that exploded in the early-to-mid Eighties, often found a way around the computer’s drawbacks, producing results that were previously thought impossible. Early platform legend  Manic Miner brought the wonder of in-game music; vast titles such as  Halls Of The Things and  Avalon introduced the concept of intelligent, off-screen enemies and even the attribute clash was thwarted with clever coders able to devise ways to bypass the effect. “I loved programming on the Spectrum,” recalls Jim Bagley, author of technically-stunning games such as  Midnight Resistance and  Cabal. “So what if it didn’t have hardware scrolling, sprites or a SID chip – it only made us better coders as we had to think more into what and how we could do something. It was a challenge.”</p><p>卡罗尔在这里提出了几点很好的观点。尽管——也许是因为——它的缺陷，该频谱还是取得了巨大的成功，最终售出了500万台。这台电脑独特的橡胶键成了竞争对手们欢笑的对象，通常被贬义地称为“死肉键”。还有属性冲突，不幸的颜色流失可能会让游戏变得混乱多彩。然而，频谱迷很快就成为80年代初至中期迅速发展的卧室编码文化的一部分，他们经常找到一种方法来克服电脑的缺点，产生以前认为不可能的结果。早期平台传奇狂躁的矿工带来了游戏音乐的奇迹；《物的殿堂》和《阿瓦隆》等大片引入了智能、屏幕外敌人的概念，甚至属性冲突也被聪明的编码人员挫败，他们能够想出绕过这种效果的方法。“我喜欢在频谱上编程，”吉姆·巴格利回忆道，他是《午夜抵抗》和《阴谋集团》等技术惊人游戏的作者。“所以，如果它没有硬件滚动、精灵或SID芯片，那该怎么办呢？它只会让我们成为更好的程序员，因为我们必须更多地思考我们可以做什么以及如何做一些事情。这是一个挑战。”</p><p>  The accessibility of the computer, plus its rapidly-rising user base, was quickly establishing it all over the UK. Games came on cheap, mass-produced cassettes, a format recognisable to most people thanks to its use in the music industry. Electronic hardware stores such as Currys and Dixons sold the computer while the shelves of all manner of retailers, from Boots to WH Smiths, were stuffed with Spectrum games. Thousands of eager computer fans studied listings of code in specialist magazines, spending hours typing the numbers and symbols into their Spectrum just to play a rudimentary Space Invaders clone – if it even worked at all. For many kids growing up in the Eighties, all they wanted was a ZX Spectrum, and one such early enthusiast was LBC broadcaster James O’Brien. “I was saving up for a ZX81 when the Spectrum came out, and I had to have one,” he recalls. “My dad promised to match whatever I saved, but when I took him to Currys and showed him that he could play Chess against it, he renegotiated and we got one.” The famed axiom was working its magic already: it’s for educational purposes, honest.</p><p>计算机的可访问性，加上其快速增长的用户群，迅速在英国各地建立了它。游戏是以廉价、批量生产的盒式磁带制作的，这种格式由于在音乐行业的使用而为大多数人所认可。Curry和Dixons等电子硬件商店出售电脑，而从Boots到WH Smith等各种零售商的货架上都塞满了频谱游戏。数千名热心的电脑迷研究了专业杂志上的代码列表，花了数小时在他们的频谱中输入数字和符号，只是为了扮演一个基本的太空入侵者克隆人——如果它真的起作用的话。对于许多在80年代长大的孩子来说，他们想要的只是一个ZX频谱，而LBC广播公司的詹姆斯·奥布莱恩（James O’Brien）就是这样一个早期的爱好者。他回忆道：“当频谱出现时，我正在为ZX81存钱，我必须有一个。”。“我爸爸答应我会把我存的钱和他匹配，但当我带他去库里，向他展示他可以和它下棋时，他重新谈判，我们得到了一个。”这个著名的公理已经发挥了它的魔力：诚实地说，它是为了教育目的。</p><p>  The industry surrounding the Spectrum and its rivals blossomed, engendering new careers, specialist retail outlets and a publishing industry that quickly realised it was the games that were selling these computers. “ Crash [magazine] was the big one,” remembers O’Brien warmly. “It was an incredible magazine, so irreverent and clever. I’d always wanted to follow my dad into news journalism, but I started thinking more about showbiz and opinion pieces because  Crash made such a big impression on me.” This is a familiar story that succinctly demonstrates the impact of the ZX Spectrum on a personal level. Says Carroll, “When I launched  Retro Gamer back in 2004 there was absolutely no question that the first issue wouldn’t include articles on Sinclair computers and  Jet Set Willy. Now, as the Spectrum celebrates its 40th anniversary, I’m still writing about it, talking about it, celebrating it.”</p><p>围绕频谱及其竞争对手的行业蓬勃发展，催生了新的职业、专业零售店和出版业，这些行业很快意识到销售这些电脑的是游戏。奥布莱恩热情地回忆道：“撞车（杂志）是个大问题。”。“这是一本令人难以置信的杂志，如此不敬和聪明。我一直想跟随父亲进入新闻行业，但我开始更多地思考娱乐圈和观点，因为《撞车》给我留下了深刻的印象。”这是一个熟悉的故事，简洁地展示了ZX频谱在个人层面上的影响。Carroll说，“当我在2004年推出Retro Gamer时，毫无疑问第一期不会包括关于Sinclair电脑和Jet Set Willy的文章。现在，在Spectrum庆祝40周年之际，我仍然在写它，谈论它，庆祝它。”</p><p>  OK. I’ve danced around the major weakness in the Spectrum for long enough. Keen to sharpen the price by economising components wherever they could, Sinclair’s chief aim for the Spectrum meant that games were not a priority. Therefore, neither was sound. “Well it was certainly a unique sound!” says Jonathan Dunn, composer of several famous 8-bit tunes. “I don’t think audio was top of the priority list when they were making the Spectrum affordable.” Having grown up adoring the Commodore 64’s brilliant SID chip, Dunn became associated with the AY chip, a far superior dedicated sound chip that came with the latter 128K Spectrum models. “I enjoyed working with the AY chip,” he says. “In some respects it was much easier to make something sound comparatively good to the other stuff out there at the time and I think the melodies came through more.” To begin with, we had to contend with the original Spectrum’s screechy on-off sound. But incredibly, as with attribute clash, canny developers found a way around the limits of the machine, with musician Tim Follin in particular producing some amazing tunes from the primitive beeper.</p><p>好啊我已经围绕光谱中的主要弱点跳了足够长的时间了。辛克莱热衷于通过尽可能节约组件来提高价格，他对频谱的主要目标意味着游戏并不是首要任务。因此，两者都不健全。“这的确是一种独特的声音！”几首著名的8位曲子的作曲家乔纳森·邓恩说。“我认为，当他们让频谱价格合理时，音频并不是首要任务。”邓恩从小酷爱海军准将64出色的SID芯片，后来他与AY芯片联系在一起，AY芯片是一款卓越的专用声音芯片，与后一款128K频谱型号一起提供。“我喜欢和AY芯片一起工作，”他说。“在某些方面，与当时的其他东西相比，让某样东西听起来相对较好要容易得多，我认为旋律的影响更大。”首先，我们必须应对原始频谱的尖锐开关声。但令人难以置信的是，就像属性冲突一样，精明的开发人员找到了绕过机器极限的方法，音乐家蒂姆·福林（Tim Follin）尤其用原始的寻呼机制作了一些令人惊叹的曲子。</p><p>  Above: Jonathan Dunn’s ZX Spectrum Robocop theme was so catchy, it was even used in this TV advert for electrical goods.</p><p>上图：乔纳森·邓恩（Jonathan Dunn）的ZX Spectrum Robocop主题非常吸引人，它甚至被用在了这则电子产品的电视广告中。</p><p> In addition to journalists such as O’Brien and Carroll, there was a whole swathe of people creating games, firstly in their bedrooms, before working directly for software houses or development studios as the games market became more commercially minded in the mid-Eighties. While on a global scale the computer was no match for the Commodore 64, in the UK and much of Europe, the Spectrum was making a huge impact. Working at publisher Quicksilva in the early Eighties was Rod Cousens, today a veteran of Codemasters and Jagex. “The vibe in the computer industry at the time was something akin to a revolution,” Cousens tells me. “And the creative companies of the time – Psion, Bug-Byte, Silversoft and us – all thought we could conquer the world. There was a tremendous camaraderie and it was a very exciting time with young programmers working out of their bedrooms, constantly coming forward with ideas.” As one of the major early software players, Quicksilva knew all about the Spectrum before Cousens finally saw one in its completed form at the Home Computer Fair, Royal Horticultural Halls, London. “The main talking points were the 48K of RAM and the rubber keys!” he laughs. Having left Quicksilva to form  Activision’s UK operation, Electric Dreams, Cousens oversaw the production of many more notable Spectrum games before stepping into management and consultancy roles.</p><p>除了奥布莱恩和卡罗尔这样的记者外，还有一大群人在创作游戏，首先是在卧室里，然后直接为软件公司或开发工作室工作，因为游戏市场在80年代中期变得更加商业化。虽然在全球范围内，这台计算机无法与Commodore 64匹敌，但在英国和欧洲大部分地区，它的频谱正在产生巨大的影响。80年代初，罗德·库森斯（Rod Cousens）在出版商Quicksilva工作，如今他是代码大师和Jagex的老手。“当时计算机行业的氛围类似于一场革命，”库森斯告诉我。“当时的创意公司——Psion、Bug Byte、Silversoft和我们——都认为我们可以征服世界。他们之间有着巨大的友谊，年轻程序员在卧室里工作，不断提出想法，这是一段非常激动人心的时光。”作为早期主要的软件玩家之一，Quicksilva在Cousens最终在伦敦皇家园艺厅的家庭电脑展上看到一个完整的频谱之前就已经了解了所有频谱。“主要的话题是48K的RAM和橡胶钥匙！”他笑了。在离开Quicksilva组建Activision的英国运营公司Electric Dreams后，Cousens在担任管理和咨询角色之前，曾监督过许多更著名的频谱游戏的制作。</p><p>  Above: Big budget licences such as this adaptation of sci-fi horror movie hit Aliens came to dominate the Spectrum games market.</p><p>上图：这部改编自科幻恐怖电影《外星人》的大预算许可证开始主导频谱游戏市场。</p><p> The ZX Spectrum was cheap, and it would be hard to argue that its price wasn’t a factor in its success. Once that established user base was set, the platform made solid commercial sense to release games on, ensuring that 48K games continued to dominate, despite the appearance of the superior 128K model in January 1986. And while there were amateur coders and those that used their Spectrum for word processing or accounting, it was really all about the games. “For many gamers it was the first stepping stone that led to the Amiga,  Mega Drive, PlayStation and so on,” says Carroll. “But for others, it’s much more than just nostalgia.” When, last year, Sir Clive Sinclair sadly passed away, the outpouring of tributes from people working in IT and engineering was incredible. “They owed their careers to the Spectrum and its forebear, the ZX81,” notes Carroll. “They dabbled, and it opened the door.”</p><p>ZX频谱很便宜，很难说它的价格不是它成功的一个因素。一旦建立了用户基础，该平台就具备了发布游戏的坚实商业意义，确保48K游戏继续占据主导地位，尽管1986年1月出现了更高级的128K机型。虽然有业余的程序员和那些使用他们的频谱进行文字处理或会计的人，但这一切都是关于游戏的。卡罗尔说：“对许多玩家来说，这是通向Amiga、Mega Drive、PlayStation等游戏的第一块踏脚石。”。“但对其他人来说，这不仅仅是怀旧。”去年，当克莱夫·辛克莱爵士不幸去世时，IT和工程领域的工作人员倾诉的悼念之情令人难以置信。卡罗尔指出：“他们的职业生涯归功于频谱及其前身ZX81。”。“他们摸了摸，门就开了。”</p><p>  Above: Kim Justice is just one of the many YouTubers who spreading the love of the Spectrum. Here’s her loving tribute to Sir Clive Sinclair.</p><p>上图：Kim Justice只是众多传播频谱之爱的年轻人之一。以下是她对克莱夫·辛克莱爵士的致意。</p><p> Commercially, the Spectrum was a sound investment and a good seller; but that doesn’t explain how so many fell in love with its quirky charms, and still love the computer today. The answer perhaps lies with the relevant context of the time. “Apart from those multiple choice books and clunky consoles, it was the first thing we could do that was truly interactive,” remembers O’Brien. “Communicating with a machine, taking part in stories – it was next level.” While popular in the UK, the Atari 2600, and more pertinently, its cartridge-based games, were expensive. The price, and ubiquity of Spectrum games helped its popularity, especially when budget companies such as Mastertronic and Atlantis entered the market. “I loved Atlantis!” exclaims O’Brien. “They were budget, so I could actually buy their releases with my pocket-money. Getting an [full price] Ocean game was strictly birthday and Christmas.” Like O’Brien, I loved budget games, and especially the freedom and interactivity of text adventures, even though I seldom progressed far. Imaginative, clever and often abstruse, their appeal can be baffling today. “Even without the inevitable crashes and failures to load, the gameplay was so slow,” notes O’Brien. “But at the same time it all felt so immediate and exciting.”</p><p>从商业角度来看，该频谱是一项可靠的投资，也是一个畅销品；但这并不能解释为什么有那么多人爱上了电脑的古怪魅力，并且至今仍爱着电脑。答案可能取决于当时的相关背景。“除了那些选择题书和笨重的控制台，我们能做的第一件事就是真正的互动，”奥布莱恩回忆道。“与机器交流，参与故事——这是下一个层次。”虽然Atari 2600在英国很受欢迎，但其基于盒式磁带的游戏也很昂贵。频谱游戏的价格和普遍性有助于它的流行，尤其是当Mastertronic和Atlantis等廉价公司进入市场时。“我爱亚特兰蒂斯！”奥布莱恩喊道。“它们很便宜，所以我可以用我的零用钱买它们的发行版。得到一款（全价）海洋游戏严格来说是生日和圣诞节。”和奥布莱恩一样，我喜欢廉价游戏，尤其是文本冒险的自由和互动性，尽管我很少取得进展。他们富于想象力、聪明，而且往往深奥难懂，如今的吸引力令人困惑。“即使没有不可避免的崩溃和加载失败，游戏玩起来还是很慢，”奥布莱恩说。“但与此同时，一切都让人感到如此直接和激动。”</p><p>  By the early Nineties, the Spectrum was hopelessly outclassed and in 1992 production finally ceased. Latent influence aside, the rest of the decade passed relatively quietly for the computer, a handful of dedicated followers continuing to create software and emulators for modern platforms. Then, in 2004, with the publication of the first issue of  Retro Gamer magazine, the Spectrum began to gain in popularity once more as a mass of gamers wallowed in the nostalgia of their first games machine – sorry, Sir Clive, but to most of us, that’s what it was. As I type, issue two of the Spectrum Next, a new Spectrum for a modern age, is overcoming supply problems and hoping for a release soon;  Crash magazine is back in WH Smiths; and multiple software houses such as Bitmapsoft and Cronosoft are still releasing games, on cassette, for the mighty ZX Spectrum.</p><p>到了90年代初，这一光谱被彻底超越，并于1992年停止生产。撇开潜在影响不谈，这十年剩下的时间对计算机来说相对平静地过去了，一小撮忠实的追随者继续为现代平台创建软件和模拟器。然后，在2004年，随着《复古玩家》杂志第一期的出版，随着大量玩家沉浸在对他们的第一台游戏机的怀旧中，这一系列游戏再次开始流行起来——对不起，克莱夫爵士，但对我们大多数人来说，这就是它。在我打字的同时，下一期的第二期，一个面向现代的新频谱，正在克服供应问题，并希望很快发布；《撞车》杂志又回到了WH Smiths；Bitmapsoft和Cronosoft等多家软件公司仍在为强大的ZX频谱发布盒式游戏。</p><p>  And of course, the Spectrum is endlessly discussed, its games adored and discovered on social media platforms every day. “It’s because so many people have wonderful childhood memories of playing games on it and cherish those good times,” notes veteran Spectrum programmer Jim Bagley. “It’s like a really good friend, it gave you great times and was always ready to make you happy.” Like many of our childhood memories, the Spectrum is revered today precisely because of this, and the added knowledge that many of us – me included – would probably not be doing what we do today without the eccentric and undeniably British invention. “The current gaming market has its roots in that era and owes its existence to that time,” observes Cousens. “The design, size and its games made the Spectrum compelling at the time. It was also a great medium of expression and was affordable. And it was British.”</p><p>当然，人们对这一领域的讨论无穷无尽，每天都在社交媒体平台上欣赏和发现它的游戏。资深频谱程序员吉姆·巴格利（Jim Bagley）指出：“这是因为很多人都有在上面玩游戏的美好童年记忆，并珍惜那些美好时光。”。“它就像一个真正的好朋友，它给了你美好的时光，总是准备让你快乐。”就像我们童年的许多记忆一样，这一光谱在今天受到尊重正是因为这一点，而我们中的许多人——包括我在内——如果没有这项古怪且无可否认的英国发明，可能不会像今天这样做。库森斯说：“当前的游戏市场起源于那个时代，它的存在要归功于那个时代。”。“它的设计、尺寸和游戏在当时让它引人注目。它也是一种很好的表达媒介，而且价格合理。它是英国的。”</p><p> The freedom of expression, the ability to not only play and interact, but also to create, is the core tenet that fired so many imaginations back in the Eighties, and is possibly the leading explanation for the Spectrum’s success. Says O’Brien, “It kept us company during the notoriously tricky business of adolescence and let us escape into other people’s imaginations in ways that had never been possible before. I thought it was the future.”</p><p>言论自由，不仅是游戏和互动的能力，而且是创造的能力，是80年代激发如此多想象力的核心原则，可能是该光谱成功的主要原因。奥布莱恩说：“这让我们在臭名昭著的青少年时期得以陪伴，让我们以前所未有的方式逃离他人的想象。我以为这就是未来。”</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/zx/">#zx</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
