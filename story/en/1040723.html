Particularly first-person shooters   Quake II,  SiN, and  Unreal Tournament. Out of all of them, my favorite was   Half-Life. The gameplay felt solid. The ambiance of the environment was immersive. The weapons felt heavy and responsive. The cast was engaging —  Marc Laidlaw’s plausible scenario where theoretical scientists open a portal to an alien universe.</p><p>当我们在1998年购买家用计算机时，我被PC视频游戏所吸引。特别是第一人称射击游戏Quake II，SiN和Unreal Tournament。在所有这些中，我最喜欢的是《半条命》。游戏的感觉很扎实。环境的身临其境。武器感到沉重且反应灵敏。演员阵容引人入胜-马克·莱德劳（Marc Laidlaw）的合理场景，理论科学家为外星宇宙打开了门户。</p><p>  In my opinion,  Half-Life’s online multiplayer battle mode felt realistic and fast-paced.  HLDM ( Half-Life   Deathmatch) was a place where online strangers compete to obtain “frags.”</p><p>  在我看来，《半条命》的在线多人战斗模式让人感觉既现实又快节奏。 HLDM（半条命死亡竞赛）是一个在线陌生人竞争获得“碎片”的地方。</p><p>  At about the same time I engaged with others in these online matches, the company that developed the game,  Valve, released an SDK (software development kit) in  April 1999. The SDK enabled the community to modify the game to their liking. This helped the game’s popularity surge.</p><p>  大约在与其他人进行在线比赛的同时，开发游戏的公司Valve于1999年4月发布了SDK（软件开发工具包）。SDK使社区能够根据自己的喜好修改游戏。这有助于游戏的人气激增。</p><p> “My first memory of HLDM was joining a server running a map called “ Stalkyard”. The things that sucked were the dial-up connection… and the game’s awful netcode.”</p><p> “我对HLDM的第一个记忆是加入一台运行名为“ Stalkyard”的地图的服务器。糟糕的是拨号连接……以及游戏糟糕的网络代码。”</p><p>  Before discovering  Half-Life, I dabbled in custom configuration changes in games like  Red Alert and  Rainbow Six. But  Half-Life was my gateway to real customization with computer programming —  modding to a community.</p><p>  在发现《半条命》之前，我涉猎了Red Alert和Rainbow Six等游戏中的自定义配置更改。但是《半条命》是我通过计算机编程进行真正自定义的门户，即为社区服务。</p><p> “I remember Dad buying a copy of Microsoft Visual Studio Professional from Circuit City. He looked at me, “What is this for?” I shrugged, “I want to mod games.””</p><p> “我记得爸爸从Circuit City购买了Microsoft Visual Studio Professional的副本。他看着我，“这是为了什么？”我耸了耸肩，“我想改装游戏。”</p><p> My curiosity engaged. How could I modify the weapons in the game to play differently? Then, without any prior programming knowledge, I started a modification later to be called   Cold Ice.</p><p> 我的好奇心投入了。我如何修改游戏中的武器以发挥不同的效果？然后，在没有任何先验编程知识的情况下，我后来进行了一个名为Cold Ice的修改。 </p><p>  Cold Ice was fueled by changing the mechanics and “skins” (textures) of the weapons. I harnessed the digital echo-chamber of a clan — a group of people playing on the same team. The experience overtook my game consumption into a leading mod maker, an accidental producer/creator.</p><p>改变武器的力学和“皮肤”（质地）可为“冰冰”加油。我利用了氏族的数字回音室-一群人在同一支球队中比赛。经验使我的游戏消费超过了领先的mod制造商，一个偶然的制作人/创造者。</p><p>  “Cold Ice was unique, immature, violent, provocative, and rather…odd. But I didn’t care.”</p><p>  “冰冰是独特的，不成熟的，暴力的，挑衅性的，甚至是……奇特的。但是我不在乎。”</p><p> Over time,  Cold Ice became popular. Its concept was simple. Fast play, lots of explosions,  unearth unused weapons, a unique winter ambiance, and a good time.</p><p> 随着时间的流逝，冷冰开始流行。它的概念很简单。快速玩耍，大量爆炸，发掘未使用的武器，独特的冬季氛围和美好时光。</p><p>  The mod’s origin was discovered by accident. I found the “invert” functionality of  Paint Shop Pro. After extracting the player’s texture, Gordon Freeman, I recompiled it and placed it back into the pack file (a zip file the game uses to load resources).</p><p>  国防部的起源是偶然发现的。我发现了Paint Shop Pro的“反转”功能。提取了玩家的纹理Gordon Freeman之后，我对其进行了重新编译，然后将其放回到pack文件中（游戏用来加载资源的zip文件）。</p><p> It just so happen that the inverted texture looked cold. And hence, the mod name was born.</p><p> 碰巧倒置的纹理看起来很冷。因此，mod名称诞生了。</p><p>  When I first picked up the SDK, I knew nothing about game concepts and how to produce results. With research, I found the instruments to make the modifications. This included a toolchain of applications and 3D modeling software. What assisted discovery was the investigation of other’s modification project structures. I would download, unpack, and review their materials.</p><p>  初次使用SDK时，我对游戏概念以及如何产生结果一无所知。通过研究，我找到了进行修改的工具。其中包括应用程序和3D建模软件的工具链。辅助发现是对其他人的改造项目结构的调查。我将下载，解压缩并查看其材料。</p><p> “And in some cases, creative liberty was taken to “borrow” others project artifacts. In fact, I borrowed everything.”</p><p> “在某些情况下，创造自由被用来“借用”其他项目文物。实际上，我借了一切。” </p><p>  Tools like Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 6.0, Paint Shop Pro 5.0, 3D Studio Max, and  Valve’s Hammer were learning curves for me. Still, I was determined to deliver an experience.</p><p>Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 6.0，Paint Shop Pro 5.0、3D Studio Max和Valve的Hammer等工具正在为我学习曲线。尽管如此，我还是决心提供一种经验。</p><p>  “That experience was a crazy good time with lots of explosive devices. And those sound effects were hot as they were lifted from other pak0 files.”</p><p>  “这段经历是疯狂的好时光，它配备了许多爆炸装置。从其他pak0文件中删除这些声音效果时，声音效果很热。”</p><p>  Experimenting with how the game was modified exposed me to wear many different “hats.” One day I would be working on developing a webpage to market the modification, the following day, I would be plugging a  vbsp ray trace “leak” on compiling a map. The next day I would be editing the game mechanics. The intensity of the exploration sapped a majority of hours away from socializing in High School.</p><p>  尝试修改游戏的方式使我戴着许多不同的“帽子”。有一天，我将致力于开发一个网页来销售修改版本，第二天，我将在编译地图时插入vbsp射线跟踪“泄漏”。第二天，我将编辑游戏机制。在高中进行社交活动时，探索的强度减少了大部分时间。</p><p>  “I stayed up late for many nights at a time. The grit to discover was immensely awesome. Nothing else mattered.“</p><p>  “我一次熬夜很晚。发现的毅力非常棒。没关系。”</p><p>  The tooling for  Half-Life was a disparate toolchain. It was a grab-bag from various companies and modding teams. Since  Half-Life’s tech incremented off  John Carmack’s (inventor of the base technology for  Half-Life) brilliance in design decisions and logical organization,  Quake&#39;s tools were useful. They were implements to look deeper in detail.</p><p>  《半条命》的工具是一条截然不同的工具链。这是来自各种公司和改装团队的抢购包。由于Half-Life的技术取代了John Carmack（Half-Life基本技术的发明者）在设计决策和逻辑组织方面的才华，因此Quake的工具非常有用。它们是更详细地研究的工具。</p><p> I was driven by the discovery of making things different. At that time, I was involved online with a team of players who wanted to see what we could do. This is what fueled me to keep going.</p><p> 我被发现与众不同的发现所驱动。当时，我与一群想了解我们能做什么的球员一起在线参与。这就是促使我继续前进的动力。</p><p>  Understanding how to build things that were required at the time was intense. Building websites, modeling new weapons, coding game logic, 2D art, finding and creating sound effects, and building levels were unique challenges to be discovered.</p><p>  非常了解如何构建当时所需的东西。建立网站，建模新武器，编码游戏逻辑，2D艺术，查找和创建声音效果以及构建级别是要发现的独特挑战。 </p><p> “It was a vast playground of learning while being surrounded by invisible nerds doing the same.”</p><p>“这是一个广阔的学习场馆，但周围却被无形的书呆子包围着。”</p><p>  As time went by, I learned of community resources that healed my knowledge gaps. Conversations happened through forums and mailing lists. The best example was the Wavelength board, pictured below.  Wavelength was a community watering hole, a place where we ask questions and got correct answers.</p><p>  随着时间的流逝，我了解到可以弥补我的知识鸿沟的社区资源。通过论坛和邮件列表进行对话。最好的例子是波长板，如下图所示。 Wavelength是一个社区的水坑，是我们提出问题并获得正确答案的地方。</p><p> “There were absolutely no wikis at that time, and no Lycos or Excite search worth its salt in finding what needed to be found. Everything was bookmarked in the mind.”</p><p> “当时绝对没有Wiki，也没有Lycos或Excite搜索值得寻找所需内容。一切都铭记在心。”</p><p>  Players of  Cold Ice highly appreciated the  sound effects. The explosive sounds, the blaring of the multiple rockets, and the new weapon effects made  Cold Ice what it was at the time. Crafting an experience was the result of finding resources that added value to the play.</p><p>  Cold Ice的玩家非常欣赏声音效果。爆炸的声音，多发火箭弹的响亮以及新的武器效果使Cold Ice达到了当时的水平。精心设计体验是寻找可以增加剧本价值的资源的结果。</p><p>  Finding knowledge and interacting with a community was a part of that toolchain. And after finding that community, my skillset could only go so far. There is a point at which specialization was needed. I had to  scale myself. This is what happened next.</p><p>  找到知识并与社区互动是该工具链的一部分。在找到那个社区之后，我的技能只能走得那么远。有一点需要专业化。我不得不调整自己。这就是接下来发生的事情。</p><p> “What was this place? It was intoxicating with creative pleasure that nights, weekends, and summers would simply disappear.”</p><p> “这是什么地方？夜晚，周末和夏天都将消失，这令人陶醉。</p><p>   As  Cold Ice’s development went on, individuals came forward to usher the mod’s development. If I had to count, it was thirty contributors over its short lifespan. People liked the mod and wanted to add new value. This included level makers, modelers, and other artists to create an experience.</p><p>   随着Cold Ice的发展，个人挺身迎来mod的发展。如果我不得不数的话，那是在其短暂的生命周期中的三十位贡献者。人们喜欢这个mod，并希望增加新的价值。其中包括关卡制作者，建模者和其他艺术家，以创造一种体验。 </p><p>  This allowed me to concentrate on my expertise area. For me, it was about game mechanics and improving the gameplay, making it balanced. I really liked the programming aspect and building the libraries called  .dlls. The libraries contained the logic to make the weapons act differently. Every time I changed gaming behavior, it would have to be recompiled, and the game relaunched. This loop took at least three minutes for every change.</p><p>这使我能够专注于自己的专业领域。对我来说，这是关于游戏机制和改善游戏玩法，使其平衡的问题。我真的很喜欢编程方面的内容，并喜欢构建名为.dlls的库。图书馆包含使武器行为有所不同的逻辑。每次更改游戏行为时，都必须重新编译游戏，然后重新启动游戏。每次更改至少需要三分钟的时间。</p><p> 2D art was also of interest. I enjoyed fiddling with the HUD (heads up display), the information printed on the screen. I spent many hours developing a “smart hud notification system,” experimenting with mapping sprites (varying-transparency graphics). The goal was to improve real-time information and to enhance the play experience.</p><p> 2D艺术也很有趣。我很喜欢HUD（抬头显示器），即屏幕上打印的信息。我花了很多时间开发“智能平视显示器通知系统”，并尝试了映射精灵（可变透明图形）。目的是改善实时信息并增强游戏体验。</p><p>  “I went through this code, compile, launch, test loop thousands of times. It was like being a magician where things kept changing to my will. It was fascinating as it was frustratingly slow.”</p><p>  “我遍历了这段代码，进行了数千次编译，启动，测试循环。就像当魔术师一样，事情不断地改变着我的意愿。令人着迷的是它令人沮丧的缓慢。”</p><p>  At the time, the people I met were centrally located on a popular chat messenger called  ICQ and  Internet Relay Chat, a chatroom agent. And, of course, the ubiquitous email. There wasn’t anywhere near the video chat and tooling we have today.</p><p>  当时，我遇到的人位于一个受欢迎的聊天工具ICQ和一个聊天室代理Internet Relay Chat的中心。当然还有无处不在的电子邮件。我们今天拥有的视频聊天和工具近在咫尺。</p><p>  “And what is odd is that the identities of the individuals remain hidden. Probably for good reason; the acne was boiling over.</p><p>  “而且奇怪的是，个人身份仍然隐藏。可能是有充分理由的；痤疮沸腾了。</p><p> I only knew the names of one or two individuals, but we never once spoke on video in all that time. Besides, the cameras were too grainy on  NetMeeting. I was on dial-up at the time.</p><p> 我只知道一个或两个人的名字，但我们从来没有一次在视频中讲话过。此外，在NetMeeting上，相机太粗糙了。当时我正在拨号。</p><p> “The disreputable team was global. From Germany, Canada, Austria, UK, Finland, the USA, Australia, and other countries, we worked together to deliver something cool.”</p><p> “无可争议的团队是全球性的。来自德国，加拿大，奥地利，英国，芬兰，美国，澳大利亚和其他国家/地区的我们共同努力，提供了很棒的东西。” </p><p> Contributors poured in from all channels. Whether it be voice-overs, writing documentation and READMEs, 3D modeling experts, and numerous map makers. They all taught me how to become better at each skillset. Their gifts were appreciated and leveraged.</p><p>来自所有渠道的贡献者纷纷涌入。无论是旁白，撰写文档和自述文件，3D建模专家以及众多地图制作者。他们都教我如何在每个技能组上变得更好。他们的礼物受到赞赏和利用。</p><p>  And it also went the other way. See above and below. We were invited to contribute code and artistry in the community, which we did. The mods were popular at the time. In fact, both modifications,  Trinity Command and   Wasteland HL ( WHL), were associated with early contributors of  Cold Ice.</p><p>  而且它也相反。请参阅上方和下方。我们受邀为社区贡献代码和艺术性。该mod当时很流行。实际上，三位一体司令部和荒原高地（WHL）的两种修改都与冷冰的早期贡献者有关。</p><p>  I personally loved   WHL and  Trinity Command because of their dedicated art direction. The feel of the gameplay was fantastic. When I had the chance to contribute to the weapons, HUD, and gameplay code, I had a lot of fun — I contributed to something larger than what we originally founded. And these founders were intensely good at the artwork and creating an atmospheric experience.</p><p>  我个人很喜欢WHL和Trinity Command，因为他们专注于艺术指导。游戏的感觉很棒。当我有机会为武器，HUD和游戏代码做出贡献时，我获得了很多乐趣–我贡献了比我们最初创建的更大的东西。这些创始人非常擅长于艺术品并营造出大气的体验。</p><p> “These contributors spearheaded other mods later, a testament to growing obnoxious leaders in digital  cabals. And I was too obtuse to stay with them. Drama was shared between individuals and mod teams.”</p><p> “这些贡献者后来率先推出了其他模组，这证明了数字阴谋集团中不断增长的令人讨厌的领导者。而且我太钝了，不能和他们在一起。个人和国防部团队之间共享戏剧。”</p><p>  Mod making was collaborative at that time — in the summer of 1999, we were invited to alpha test   Counter-Strike with the map  cs_siege. I gave notes back to the “test party.” Unfortunately, these notes are lost, but I remember that the mod was absolutely excellent.  Counter-Strike became quite popular. So popular…that Valve eventually acquired them, and the mod became a globally recognized household brand.</p><p>  当时，MOD制作是协作的，在1999年夏天，我们被邀请使用地图cs_siege进行Counter-Strike的Alpha测试。我给“测试聚会”做笔记。不幸的是，这些笔记丢失了，但我记得该mod绝对出色。反恐精英变得非常流行。如此受欢迎……以至于Valve最终收购了它们，并且mod成为了全球公认的家用品牌。</p><p>   We went forward in developing  Cold Ice, rarely using version control, unit tests, product testing, or anything that would remotely resemble a modern development shop.</p><p>   我们继续开发Cold Ice，很少使用版本控制，单元测试，产品测试或任何与现代开发商店类似的东西。</p><p> However, we launched the modification versions anyway, and when things broke, we quickly launched patches where they were needed (which happened frequently). It was a real R&amp;D (research and development) setup.</p><p> 但是，无论如何，我们都启动了修改版本，但当出现问题时，我们迅速在需要它们的地方启动了补丁程序（这经常发生）。这是真正的研发（研发）设置。 </p><p>  “Craftsmanship is a new business we buy into; which didn’t exist at this time in software. Clean wasn’t in the vernacular. But we all needed serious personal linting.”</p><p>“工艺是我们的一项新业务；目前在软件中尚不存在。清洁不是白话。但是我们所有人都需要认真的起毛。”</p><p> Between developers and artists, the process was libertarian. We shared most files through private FTP’s (file transfer protocol) and sparingly used patch files. We furiously messaged each other when changes occurred. What was most appreciated was the extreme quickness of the releases. Nothing ever stopped the team from delivering an update due to quality concerns.</p><p> 在开发人员和艺术家之间，这个过程是自由主义者。我们通过私有FTP（文件传输协议）和很少使用的补丁文件共享了大多数文件。发生更改时，我们相互发了言。最令人赞赏的是发布速度极快。出于质量方面的考虑，团队从未停止过提供更新。</p><p>  “We listened to the community. We recklessly launched, in a way that promoted chaos.”</p><p>  “我们听取了社区的意见。我们不顾一切地以一种导致混乱的方式发动了进攻。”</p><p>  The outcomes of the modification were never completely validated. But what is certain is that in developing software, craftmanship was never a crutch we used to validate our software existence. I didn’t know at the time, nor did the community.</p><p>  修改的结果从未得到完全验证。但是可以肯定的是，在开发软件时，工艺绝不是我们用来验证软件存在的拐杖。当时我不知道，社区也不知道。</p><p> “This is not to say we didn’t have a practice or discipline. That practice was harnessing the pureist form of autodidactic exploration. The discipline was to ship. It was a Holy Land of craft, a geek Nirvana, a Mecca of maximum return on discovery.”</p><p> “这并不是说我们没有实践或纪律。这种做法利用了自学探索的纯粹形式。纪律是运送。这是一个手工艺圣地，一个极客极乐世界，一个获得最大回报的圣地。”</p><p>  There is a lot to be said about software quality in association with predictability. To think, after writing tens of thousands of tests over my career and nudging others to do the same, we once launched new software without the automatic checks. We celebrated our  beta testers, and that was refreshing, liberating, and free.</p><p>  关于软件质量和可预测性，有很多要说的。想一想，在我写了成千上万的职业测试并勉励他人也这样做之后，我们曾经启动了没有自动检查功能的新软件。我们庆祝了Beta测试人员，它令人耳目一新，解放了并且免费。</p><p>  After several versions,  Cold Ice made it to the   mod of the week located at  Kevin “Fragmaster” Bowen’s Planet Half-Life (PHL). PHL was the central community hub located on the defunct  Gamespy network.</p><p>  经过多个版本后，Cold Ice成为本周的mod，位于Kevin“ Fragmaster” Bowen的星球半衰期（PHL）。 PHL是位于已失效的Gamespy网络上的中央社区中心。 </p><p>  Others in the community noticed. I remember being invited to  Valve’s 1999 Mod Expo in San Francisco, which I did not show —</p><p>社区中的其他人注意到了。我记得曾受邀参加Valve在旧金山举行的1999年Mod Expo，但我没有展示过-</p><p>  “I never pushed my parents to fly to SF, nor was extroverted enough to go through such a frightening social event — I was acutely introverted.”</p><p>  “我从来没有强迫父母飞到旧金山，也没有外向到足以经历如此令人恐惧的社交活动-我非常内向。”</p><p> And then there was the regular  PHL mailbag. There always seemed to be a community. The replies were very positive, and the trolls abrasive as ever.</p><p> 然后是常规的PHL邮袋。似乎总是有一个社区。答复非常积极，巨魔一如既往。</p><p> “At that time, being a troll was normal fanfare. Everyone was doing it. Memes were the middle finger made in MS Paint.”</p><p> “那时，成为巨魔是正常的声名狼藉。每个人都在做。模因是MS Paint制造的中指。”</p><p>  These events were like being #1 on the Apple app store in a major category and receiving tens of thousands of retweets within an hour. This was validation that we were doing things correctly and that the community was receptive.</p><p>  这些事件就像在主要类别的Apple应用商店中排名第一，并且在一小时内收到成千上万的转发。这是对我们做事正确以及社区乐于接受的验证。</p><p>  Lots of people liked the play. Version 1.75, our most loved version, was the golden master build (GM) — a time when the software was burned to CDs and marked as 1.0 for manufacturing.</p><p>  很多人喜欢这出戏。我们最喜欢的版本1.75是金色的主版本（GM），这是将软件刻录到CD上并标记为1.0进行生产的时期。</p><p>  Cold Ice launched the beta 1 2.x update that changed how the game was played. This version visually improved the weapons and skins and experimented with an exchange system. This wasn’t receptive, as noted in the poll.</p><p>  Cold Ice推出了Beta 1 2.x更新，从而改变了游戏的玩法。此版本在视觉上改进了武器和皮肤，并尝试了交换系统。如民意调查所述，这并不令人接受。 </p><p>  We paused the development of  Cold Ice as I contributed to other modifications and started to branch out to other areas, learning more about pure deathmatch play.   Half-Life Pro was an experiment inspired by   Oz Deathmatch.  HLPro contained a mountain of configurable  cvars (console variables) that included game modes, mutators (rules that change the way the game is played), and a redesigned heads up display.</p><p>当我为其他修改做贡献时，我们暂停了Cold Ice的开发，并开始涉足其他领域，了解有关纯粹死亡竞赛游戏的更多信息。 《半条命》 Pro是一项受《绿野仙踪》启发的实验。 HLPro包含大量可配置的cvar（控制台变量），其中包括游戏模式，mutator（改变游戏规则的规则）和重新设计的抬头显示器。</p><p>  In mid-2000, while work was going on  HLPro, we launched a  “Cold Ice SDK” of our own. It appeared we “shut-down”  Cold Ice, but that wasn’t actually the case. We attempted something bigger.</p><p>  2000年中期，在HLPro进行开发的同时，我们推出了自己的“ Cold Ice SDK”。看来我们“关闭”了“冷冰”，但实际上并非如此。我们尝试了更大的尝试。</p><p>   As we grew, we realized that the current production version was highly naive. We wanted to improve. As we were working on other things, Valve broke the ecosystem by launching a non-backward compatible 1.1.0.0 update to the game. This caused labor for modders. Unless a non-trivial patch was attempted, the full crop of mods —  up to Spring 2000 — crashed on loading.</p><p>   随着我们的成长，我们意识到当前的生产版本非常幼稚。我们想改善。当我们在做其他事情时，Valve通过向游戏启动非向后兼容的1.1.0.0更新来破坏了生态系统。这给改装者造成了劳动。除非尝试了一个不重要的补丁，否则直到2000年春季之前，全部mod加载时都崩溃了。</p><p> “Valve fixed the netcode by optimizing server messaging, which was welcomed. But in the process, the patch created an unwashed caste of mods that would forever be locked in the 1990’s.”</p><p> “ Valve通过优化服务器消息传递来修复网络代码，这受到欢迎。但是在此过程中，补丁创建了一个未清洗的mod等级，将永远锁定在1990年代。”</p><p> And then we made a decision. Fix forward 1.75/2.x  Cold Ice or attempt bigger changes? So we went with the latter and started our  failed rewrite. We called it  Cold Ice Resurrection ( CIR). I’ll share some of that work now, as it’s never been seen.</p><p> 然后我们做出了决定。修正1.75 / 2.x Cold Ice还是尝试更大的更改？因此，我们选择了后者，并开始了失败的重写。我们称其为冷冰复活（CIR）。现在，我将分享其中的一些作品，因为从未见过。</p><p>  The work was of much higher quality than the first versions, and the maturity of the approach was light-years ahead than when we started. We matured as developers. The  evolution was tangible.</p><p>  这项工作的质量比最初的版本要高得多，而且这种方法的成熟度比我们开始时还快几年。我们已经成长为开发人员。演变是有形的。</p><p>  The resurrection was an amalgam of many themes:  Counter-Strike,   Action Half-Life,  WHL,  Trinity Command, and core elements of original  Cold Ice. The direction was unclear, but we focused on fun gameplay and lots of mutators like  Iceman Cometh.</p><p>  复活是许多主题的结合体：反恐精英，动作半条命，WHL，三位一体司令部和原始冷冰的核心元素。方向尚不清楚，但我们专注于有趣的游戏玩法和诸如Iceman Cometh之类的许多变异器。 </p><p> We kept the rewrite to ourselves, reverting our original approach to feed the community. We went as far as to inform PHL of the incoming work, and they gave us a hosting spot, but we held back from sharing. This was a mistake.</p><p>我们将重写工作保留给自己，恢复了我们为社区提供服务的原始方法。我们甚至将即将来临的工作告知了PHL，他们给了我们一个主办地，但是我们拒绝共享。这是一个错误。</p><p>  “There wasn’t a feedback loop like we had with the original versions. That was the mistake that screwed us. The resurrection was directionless in its visual beauty. I was an ineffective newb for not pushing it out the door.”</p><p>  “没有像原始版本那样的反馈循环。那是把我们搞砸的错误。复活的视觉美感是没有方向的。我没有把它推出门，所以效率很低。”</p><p>  Over time, the project became heavy, and motivation dipped to  zero. We stopped work and left the project unreleased. The project artifacts began to decay into the digital ether. No one saw the update that we worked so hard on.</p><p>  随着时间的流逝，该项目变得很繁重，并且动机降至零。我们停止了工作，并保留了未发布的项目。项目文物开始衰减到数字以太。没有人看到我们如此努力的更新。</p><p> “Without a community jeering us on, we failed to  grind through and ship. “When it’s done” never came.”</p><p> “没有一个社区来劝诱我们，我们就无法进行深入研究和运送。 “完成后，就再也没有来。”</p><p> After the beta 1 source code was lost due to a hard-drive failure, we briefly started a beta 2. My last memory of  CIR was that I wanted to modify the engine to make it snow — and then we gave up. The project was shelved in 2002.</p><p> 由于硬盘故障而导致beta 1源代码丢失后，我们短暂地启动了beta2。我对CIR的最后记忆是我想修改引擎使其下雪—然后我们放弃了。该项目于2002年搁置。</p><p> “I was pissed off. We restarted the work on a second beta with Infinity (lead contributor), but that fizzled out — and just like that, we were gibs all over the floor.”</p><p> “我很生气。我们与Infinity（首席撰稿人）一起在第二个Beta版中重新开始了工作，但最终失败了–就像那样，我们无处不在。</p><p>   Unfortunately, there isn’t a fairytale ending like what happened to other modifications. The biggest was that of Counter-Strike and  Day of Defeat, which we were apart of that community at the time.</p><p>   不幸的是，没有像其他修改那样的童话般的结局。最大的是《反恐精英》和《失败之日》，当时我们是该社区的一员。 </p><p> And that of Valve with  Gabe Newell&#39;s vision. They grew the gaming ecosystem pie by creating the massive  Steam Network.</p><p>还有Valve与Gabe Newell的愿景。他们通过创建庞大的Steam网络来扩大游戏生态系统的市场份额。</p><p>  What I can say is that for those who participated, we used  Cold Ice to hone our skills and to grow as developers and artists. It was a great experience that I always thought shaped me as a person but left me questioning my understanding of what all had happened, quietly in my bedroom.</p><p>  我能说的是，对于那些参加活动的人，我们利用Cold Ice磨练了我们的技能，并成长为开发者和艺术家。这是一次很棒的经历，我一直以为自己是一个人，但让我质疑我对所有事情的理解，安静地在卧室里。</p><p>  “The experience was like a cold night in a “digital” football game where we won on the High-School internet. But no one was there, the bleachers were empty. But Mom kept calling me for dinner.”</p><p>  “这种体验就像是在“数字”足球比赛中一个寒冷的夜晚，我们在高中互联网上获胜。但是没有人在那里，看台是空的。但是妈妈一直叫我吃饭。</p><p> My interesting lesson as a new  software engineer was  even in failure; I grew a vast skillset. I wanted to see what may happen next, what I could learn.  I would not surrender to solving a problem — a shower or a walk helped with unlocking a solution .</p><p> 作为一名新软件工程师，我有趣的一课甚至失败了。我成长了很多技能。我想看看接下来会发生什么，我可以学到什么。我不会屈服于解决问题-淋浴或散步有助于解决问题。</p><p> The larger observation was for a project to survive; it is surrounded by a community betting the team to succeed and feeding off the releases. And if the cheering is absent,  projects die.</p><p> 更大的观察是为了一个项目能够生存。它周围是一个社区，该社区押注该团队成功并提供发布。如果没有欢呼声，项目就会消失。</p><p>  “There was no money in any of this. I left wondering where will I go — work somewhere and code with real people?”</p><p>  “这没有钱。我不知道要去哪里—在某个地方工作并与真实的人一起编码？”</p><p>  The road to developing, launching, growing, and maintaining game modifications in the community had taught me lessons. As I moved forward and started my career, these experiences were not forgotten. I had a unique and valuable perspective on building things.</p><p>  在社区中开发，发布，发展和维护游戏修改的道路向我汲取了教训。当我前进并开始我的职业生涯时，这些经历并没有被忘记。我对构建事物有独特而宝贵的观点。 </p><p>  My  curiosity led to  a determination to achieve something interesting. And critical afterthoughts — not to plan projects as “big-bang” releases unless there is a commitment to a  Valve time scale, and to support backward compatibility where possible.</p><p>我的好奇心促使我下定决心要做一些有趣的事情。关键的事后思考-除非承诺使用Valve时间标尺，否则不要将项目计划为“大爆炸”发行，并在可能的情况下支持向后兼容。</p><p>  “And while all of the above is in the trashbin of gaming, the skillset is valid and memorialized for meatspace to come get me. I’d be stuck in a  ch3wz0r map to be devoured like everyone else — but know better.”</p><p>  “尽管以上所有内容都在游戏的垃圾箱中，但是该技能组是有效的，值得纪念，以备不时之需。我会陷入ch3wz0r地图中，以像其他所有人一样被吞噬，但知道得更多。”</p><p>  After another pause, we had the energy and maturity to craft something elegant. We soft-launched a mod called   HL Advanced ( HLA), a competitor to   Adrenaline Gamer ( AG), which was popular at the tail end of the golden time of modding in  Half-Life.  HLA included all of the game modes, like  1-on-1 arena matches. As it was a pure server-sided mod, no download was required.</p><p>  再停顿一下之后，我们就充满了精力和成熟度来制作精美的东西。我们软启动了一款名为HL Advanced（HLA）的mod，它是Adrenaline Gamer（AG）的竞争对手，该模型在Half-Life改装黄金时期的尾声很流行。 HLA包括所有游戏模式，例如1对1竞技场比赛。由于它是纯服务器端的mod，因此无需下载。</p><p>  “I performed a solid 10,000 hours of being a troll and building things. My skillset was ready for whatever a company would throw at me. Except people skills — I had zero hours in that business.”</p><p>  “我成为巨魔并建造东西的时间稳定了10,000小时。我的技能组已准备就绪，可以应付公司对我的任何要求。除了人际交往能力，我从事这项工作的时间为零。</p><p> But  HLA suffered the same fate as the resurrection; it was a failure. We repeated the mistake above, hiding in an unaccountable state over the brashness of launching incompletely — surrounded by trolls’ feedback. But the real fear was I’d receive no feedback at all.</p><p> 但是，解放军遭受了与复活同样的命运。这是一个失败。我们重复了上面的错误，将其隐藏在无法完全发射的野蛮状态下，被巨魔的反馈所包围。但真正的恐惧是我根本没有收到任何反馈。</p><p>   “In a golden era of mod making, Valve forever changed a scene. This wasn’t the plain old piping data in databases, it was an exploration of a new digital art form.”</p><p>   “在mod制作的黄金时代，Valve永远改变了一个场景。这不是数据库中原始的旧管道数据，而是对新的数字艺术形式的探索。”</p><p> Others eventually picked up  Cold Ice’s development. A small team  launched a 2.5 version. But over the years, it’s been inactive. Interestingly,  Cold Ice remains a small group of people on the  vast internet asking  how to set up the mod two decades later.</p><p> 其他人最终接受了Cold Ice的发展。一个小团队发布了2.5版本。但是多年来，它一直处于非活动状态。有趣的是，冷冰在庞大的互联网上仍然是一小群人，他们在询问二十年后如何设置mod。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/super-jump/building-a-popular-half-life-mod-during-the-rise-of-counter-strike-fec6a5b9fd8f">https://medium.com/super-jump/building-a-popular-half-life-mod-during-the-rise-of-counter-strike-fec6a5b9fd8f</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/流行/">#流行</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/popular/">#popular</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
