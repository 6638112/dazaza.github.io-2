On the bright morning of September 23, 2015, a woman walked outside her home to find a cream-and-coffee-colored pelt, like a small furry Pierrot. It had dark forelegs, and its face was a smoky blot. It was a cat, slit throat to belly; its intestines were gone.</p><p>      这是南伦敦门口的身体，让每个人都关注。在2015年9月23日的明亮上午，一名妇女走在家外面，找到一个奶油咖啡般的毛皮，就像一个小毛茸茸的皮里罗特。它有黑暗的前腿，它的脸是烟雾污点。这是一只猫，肚子到腹部;它的肠子消失了。</p><p>  The woman rang the authorities, who came and disposed of the body. Three days later, she looked at a leaflet that had come through her mail slot, asking whether anyone had seen Ukiyo, a four-year-old ragdoll mix whose coat matched that of the dead cat. The woman broke the bad news to Ukiyo’s owner, Penny Beeson, who lived just down Dalmally Road, a nearly unbroken strip of poky, pebble-dashed row houses in the Addiscombe area of Croydon.</p><p>  这个女人响了当局，谁来了自己的身体。三天后，她看着一把通过她的邮件插槽来的传单，询问有没有人见过Ukiyo，这是一个四岁的ragdoll混合，他的外套匹配死猫。这个女人对乌里耶的所有者，Penny Beeson的坏消息，他们住在Dalmally Road，这是克罗伊登addiscombe地区的几乎不间断的Poky，鹅卵石划线房屋。</p><p>  Beeson was inconsolable. “I shook for the whole day,” she later told  The Independent.</p><p>  蜜蜂是无法溶解的。 “我整天都震撼了，”后来告诉独立。</p><p>  “R.I.P ukiyo I feel devastated,” her son, Richard, posted on Facebook. “Hacked to death and left on someone’s doorstep.

This one warned that Ukiyo’s demise wasn’t an isolated incident—there had been a troubling spate of cat deaths in the area. The leaflet was printed by a local group called South Norwood Animal Rescue and Liberty, or SNARL.</p><p>  几天后，addiscombe的字母盒再次被交付，再次被交付。这个人警告说，Ukiyo的消亡并不是一个孤立的事件 - 该地区的猫死亡令人不安的痉挛。传单由一个名为南诺伍德动物救援和自由或咆哮的本地组印刷。</p><p>   Tony Jenkins, one of SNARL’s founders, had recently become his own master. At 51, with a reassuring, yeomanly face and a golden tinge at the very tip of his long, gray ponytail, Jenkins was laid off after 25 years working for a nearby government council. He hadn’t gotten along with his boss, so getting sacked came as something of a relief. With a year’s severance in his pocket, “I was enjoying my downtime,” Jenkins said. That included being with his girlfriend, a 44-year-old South African who went by the name Boudicca Rising, after the first-century Celtic warrior queen who fought the Romans to save the Britons. Among other things, Rising and Jenkins shared feelings of guardianship toward animals. Their homes at one point housed 34 cats, a dog, two gerbils, and a cockatoo between them. The couple had formed SNARL together.</p><p>   Tony Jenkins是Snarl的创始人之一，最近成为他自己的主人。在51岁时，在他长期灰色的马尾辫的尖端令人放心，呵护，灰色的马尾辫，Jenkins为附近的政府委员会工作25年后被解雇。他没有和他的老板一起过来，所以被解雇了，因为救济而陷入困境。詹金斯说，随着他的口袋里的遣散费，“我正在享受我的停机时间。”包括与他的女朋友在一起，一个44岁的南非人民，由Boudicca的名字上升，经过一世纪的凯尔特战士女王，他努力拯救英国人。除此之外，崛起和詹金斯共同对动物的监护感。他们的家园在一分点坐了34只猫，狗，两个老年人和他们之间的鹦鹉。这对夫妇在一起形成了咆哮。 </p><p>  Scanning Facebook one day in September 2015, about a week before Ukiyo was found dead, Jenkins stumbled upon a post from the nearby branch of the United Kingdom’s largest veterinarian chain, Vets4Pets, that described four gruesome local incidents in the past few weeks: a cat with its throat cut, one with a severed tail, another decapitated, and a fourth with a slashed stomach. Only the final cat had survived. Jenkins told Rising about the post. “That doesn’t sound right,” she said. “We need to do some digging.”</p><p>扫描Facebook在2015年9月，大约一周在Ukiyo被发现死亡，Jenkins偶然发现了来自英国最大的兽医连锁店的附近分支机构的一篇文章，兽医在过去几周内描述了四个艰难的地方事件：一只猫用喉咙切割，一个带有切断的尾巴，另一个斩首，四分之一，沉睡。只有最后的猫幸存下来。 Jenkins告诉帖子的上升。 “这听起来不对，”她说。 “我们需要做一些挖掘。”</p><p>  Digging was her forte. Always impeccably dressed, with an ornate gothic kick, and unfailingly in heels, Rising was a multitasking demon on a laptop. By day she worked for an office management company. By night she was part of the global alliance of animal rights activists. She was one of many people who used small details in online videos of a man torturing felines to identify the culprit, a Canadian man named Luka Magnotta. He was reported to police, who didn’t take the allegations seriously, and Magnotta went on to murder and chop up his lover in 2012—a crime recounted in the Netflix documentary  Don’t F**k with Cats.</p><p>  挖掘是她的强壮。总是穿着，穿着华丽的哥特式踢，并且在脚跟上宽带，崛起是笔记本电脑上的一个多任务的恶魔。日常，她为办公室管理公司工作。在夜间，她是动物权利活动家全球联盟的一部分。她是许多人中使用的少年在一个人的在线视频中使用的小细节折磨史密斯来识别罪魁祸首，一个名叫卢卡·莱卡的人。他报告给警察，谁没有认真对待指控，而Magnotta在2012年谋杀谋杀谋杀伙伴 - 在Netflix纪录片中叙述的罪行不与猫有关。</p><p>  On the heels of Ukiyo’s death, Rising and Jenkins distributed SNARL’s leaflets throughout Addiscombe, warning of the threat to local felines. While to an uninterested eye some of the attacks might have appeared to be the indiscriminate cruelty of nature—the work of a hungry predator, say—SNARL believed they might be a series of linked and deliberate killings. Whether the crimes were perpetrated by an individual or a group SNARL wasn’t sure. It hoped the leaflets would help turn up more information.</p><p>  在Ukiyo的死亡之后，崛起和詹金斯在adadiscombe整个adadiscombe发布了Snarl的传单，警告当地猫队的威胁。虽然对一个无谓的眼睛，一些攻击可能似乎是自然的不分青红皂白的残酷 - 饥饿的捕食者的工作，说 -  Snarl认为他们可能是一系列联系和故意杀戮。犯罪是由个人或群体的犯罪行为是否不确定。它希望传单有助于更新更多信息。</p><p>  SNARL soon had reports of more incidents in the area, for a total of seven: one cat missing, two with what SNARL subsequently described as “serious injuries,” and four dead. Rising said that vets who saw the deceased cats’ bodies told her the mutilations had been made with a knife. On September 29, SNARL sent out an alert on its Facebook page saying as much. The cats’ wounds, the group insisted, “could only have been inflicted by a human. Their bodies have been displayed in such a way as to cause maximum distress.”</p><p>  Snarl很快就报道了该地区更多的事件，总共七：一只猫缺失，两个人随后被描述为“严重伤”和四人死亡。崛起说，看到已故猫的猫的兽医告诉她，这是用刀制成的。 9月29日，Snarl在它的Facebook页面上发出了一个警报，如此。猫的伤口，团队坚持，“只能被人类造成伤害。他们的身体已经以造成最大痛苦的方式展示。“</p><p>  That was SNARL’s official line. On Rising’s personal page she went further, emphasizing her belief that Addiscombe was dealing with a serial killer. “This is a psychopath,” she wrote.</p><p>  那是Snarl的官方线条。在上升的个人页面上，她进一步走了，强调她的信念，即addiscombe正在处理连环杀手。 “这是一个精神病患者，”她写道。</p><p>    On the afternoon of October 24, 2015, two miles southeast of Addiscombe, 47-year-old Wayne Bryant picked his way over the fallen leaves of Threehalfpenny Wood, named for a 19th-century murder victim found there with that sum of money in his pocket. The dry autumn air kept Bryant alert as his wide-spaced blue eyes scanned left and right and he listened to the wind hissing through the oak canopy. Bryant’s cat, Amber, like many domestic felines, kept regular hours with her comings and goings, but the previous day she hadn’t returned in the mid-afternoon as she usually did. When Amber didn’t show up the following morning, Bryant and his wife, Wendy, formed a search party.</p><p>    2015年10月24日的下午，东南东南两英里，47岁的韦恩布莱恩特在三个坠子的叶片上挑选了三个世纪谋杀受害者的落叶，在他身上找到了那些金钱的金额口袋。干燥的秋季空气持续了令人震惊的蓝眼睛左右，他扫描左右，他听着横穿橡木冠层的风。布莱恩特的猫，琥珀，像国内许多猫队一样，与她的播出和留下的成功保持规律，但前一天她在下午的中期没有回来，因为她通常是如此。当琥珀没有出现第二天早上，布莱恩特和他的妻子，温迪，形成了一个搜索派对。</p><p>  A few years before, Bryant had suffered a serious spinal injury at work, causing a leak of cerebrospinal fluid and, eventually, several hematomas. Animals had always been a big part of his life—he and Wendy had a menagerie of rescue pets, from dogs to guinea pigs to lizards—but as he struggled with memory problems and long-term unemployment, the emotional support they provided became irreplaceable. Bryant had had Amber for eight years, since she was a six-week-old kitten. “A friendly little thing,” he told the website AnimalLogic. “A little curtain-climber.”</p><p>  前几年，Bryant在工作中遭受了严重的脊髓损伤，导致脑脊液泄漏，最终是几个血肿。动物一直是他生命中的一大部分 - 他和温迪有一个救援宠物的动物园，从狗到几内亚猪到蜥蜴 - 但随着他挣扎的问题和长期失业，他们提供的情感支持变得不可替代。布莱恩特曾经有过琥珀八年，因为她是一个六周的小猫。 “友好的小东西，”他告诉网站Animallogic。 “一个小窗帘攀登人。” </p><p>  As they searched the woods, Bryant’s wife called to him. In a small clearing off a path, sheltered by a cluster of exposed tree roots, the ball of black and orange fur was unmistakable. But Amber was headless and tailless, except for that appendage’s very tip, which had been placed on her belly. The couple were sickened. They shrouded their beloved pet in a towel and took her home. Then Bryant remembered an article in the  Croydon Advertiser about a group convinced that several recent cat killings were all connected.</p><p>当他们搜查伍兹时，布莱恩特的妻子叫他。在一条小的清除路径中，被一簇暴露的树根撒谎，黑色和橙色皮毛的球是明确的。但琥珀是无头和尾部的，除了那个阑尾的尖端，被放在她的肚子上。这对夫妇很生气。他们把他们心爱的宠物笼罩在毛巾上，带着她的家。然后，布莱恩特记得一篇关于一个小组的一篇文章，关于一个集团相信最近的几只猫杀手都是联系的。</p><p>   A couple of hours later, Jenkins and Rising were at Bryant’s door. “I remember Wayne’s first words to me: ‘Ain’t no fox did that,’” Jenkins told me. “If I ever write a book about this, that’s what I’d call it.”</p><p>   几个小时后，Jenkins和Rising都在布莱恩特的门口。 “我记得Wayne对我的第一个单词：'不是没有福克斯这样做，”詹金斯告诉我。 “如果我曾写过一本关于这个的书，那就是我称之为的。”</p><p>  It was the first time either Jenkins or Rising had come face-to-face with a suspected cat killing. Neither of them had any forensics training. Unwrapping the towel that held Amber, they noted the clean severing of her head and tail, which seemed to corroborate Bryant’s view that no animal could be responsible. They asked the family to show them the crime scene. There was no blood on the ground, meaning that either her injuries were inflicted after death or Amber was killed elsewhere and moved to the spot in Threehalfpenny Wood where her owners found her. Rising and Jenkins took Amber’s body to a vet for further examination.</p><p>  这是Jenkins或Rising第一次与疑似猫杀面对面。他们都没有任何取证培训。展开持有琥珀的毛巾，他们注意到她头部和尾巴的干净切断，这似乎证实了布莱恩特的观点，即没有动物可能是负责任的。他们要求家人向他们展示犯罪现场。地上没有血液，这意味着她的伤害在死亡或琥珀被杀死的地方造成伤害，在其他地方杀死，在她的主人发现她的三个哈尔夫根木材中。崛起和詹金斯将琥珀的身体带到兽医进一步考试。</p><p>  Bryant gave a statement to the police, and Rising went to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), the UK’s main animal welfare charity. She later claimed that a representative brushed her off, saying that a fox probably killed Amber. Besides, the RSPCA dealt primarily with instances of cruelty in which the victims were still alive: It received more than 11,000 complaints a year in Greater London alone.</p><p>  布莱恩特向警方发表了一份声明，并崛起前往英国主要动物福利慈善机构预防动物（RSPCA）的皇家社会。后来她声称是一个代表刷掉了她，说狐狸可能杀死了琥珀。此外，RSPCA主要处理受害者仍然活跃的虐待实例：仅在大伦敦收到超过11,000名投诉。</p><p>  Jenkins was incredulous when he heard about the RSPCA’s response. “Although Croydon’s got a bad reputation, a lot of crime, I don’t think our foxes carry knives. And foxes certainly do not kill cats,” he said. At least, “it’s very, very rare.” He doubted that scavenging creatures would be interested in removing and eating feline heads and tails. Rather, they’d go for the nutritious internal organs, and SNARL hadn’t seen that kind of damage in any killing other than Ukiyo’s.</p><p>  当他听说RSPCA的回应时，Jenkins非常令人难以置信。 “虽然克罗伊登的声誉不好，很多犯罪，我认为我们的狐狸携带刀。狐狸肯定不会杀死猫，“他说。至少，“这是非常罕见的。”他怀疑，清除生物有兴趣去除和吃猫头和尾巴。相反，他们去寻找营养的内脏器官，并且咆哮没有看到任何杀害的伤害，而不是富义的任何杀戮。</p><p>  In October, there was another suspected cat killing in Croydon. Then SNARL began to get reports from farther afield, one in neighboring Mitcham and two in nearby West Norwood. Nick Jerome’s cat, Oscar, was found headless on his street. “None of us went to pieces over it, but it was obviously distressing at the time,” he said. In Coulsdon, on the southern edge of Croydon, David Emmerson discovered his cat, Missy, decapitated and tailless. His 18-year-old daughter, already struggling with the loss of her aunt the previous year, was devastated. Emmerson never told his autistic son the full story of what happened. The truth was too ugly. “I never grew up as a cat person,” he said, “but maybe because we got her as a kitten, she became one of us. Mine was the lap she chose to sit on when she sat down. I’m not sure why. I adored her.”</p><p>  10月，在克罗伊登还有另一只疑似猫杀死。然后Snarl开始从远处的报道中获得报告，其中一个在邻近的米切姆和附近的West Norwood中的两个。 Nick Jerome的猫奥斯卡，在他的街道上被发现。 “我们都没有人去过它，但当时显然很痛苦，”他说。在Coulsdon，在克罗伊登南部边缘，大卫艾默森发现了他的猫，小姐，斩首和尾部。他18岁的女儿已经摧毁了上一年的姨妈的挣扎，被摧毁了。 Emmerson从未告诉他的自闭症儿子是发生的事情的完整故事。真相太难了。 “我从未像猫人一样长大，”他说，“但也许是因为我们把她作为一只小猫，她成为我们之一。我的膝盖是她选择的膝盖，当她坐下时坐下来。我不确定为什么。我崇拜她。“</p><p>  The RSPCA had its party line and wasn’t getting involved, but that didn’t stop the local press, which knew a good story when it heard one. By mid-November, reporters had made a lurid christening: The Croydon Cat Killer was on the prowl.</p><p>  RSPCA有派对线，并没有参与，但这并没有阻止当地的新闻界，这在听到一个人时知道一个好故事。到11月中旬，记者们提出了一个LURID CHRISTENTING：克罗伊登猫杀手正在徘徊。 </p><p>   Jenkins and Rising turned to the law for help. They met with officers in Croydon’s branch of the Metropolitan Police Service, who claimed not to have any cat killings on record. Rising referred the officers to reports the police had in fact handed to owners, and the vet records that had been filed in some of those cases. “They seemed clueless,” Rising said of the police. “Outside on the steps we realized: It’s going to be down to us.”</p><p>Jenkins和Rising转向法律寻求帮助。他们遇到了克罗伊登的官员的大都会警察局的分支机构，他声称不在记录上杀害任何猫。上涨提到了向警方报告警方的官员，该警方已经交给了所有者，以及在其中一些案件中提交的兽医纪录。 “他们似乎无人道不济，”对警察的说法。 “在我们意识到的步骤之外：它会归结为我们。”</p><p>  SNARL’s founders decided to muster evidence to present to the RSPCA and the Met. They arranged for a vet in Addiscombe, Deane Braid-Lewis, to conduct postmortems on ten cat corpses, including Amber’s. It cost £5,000—nearly $7,000—all of it raised on GoFundMe. Braid-Lewis concluded that only a “large sharp blade” could have made such clean incisions. He found no sign of bite marks that would suggest predation or scavenging by other animals. He couldn’t state with certainty that the same hand had wielded the knife in all ten cases, but he believed that the perpetrator’s skill level had improved over time. Amber had a fractured spine and generalized bleeding in the thoracic cavity, both signs of blunt-force trauma that he found in many of the other animals he examined. SNARL believed this meant that the killer was bludgeoning the pets to death, maybe after luring them with food. Braid-Lewis also found an unknown substance under Amber’s claws: Had she scratched the killer? Might it contain DNA?</p><p>  Snarl的创始人决定将证据展示给RSPCA和欧元。他们安排在addiscombe，Deane Brod-Lewis的兽医，在内的十只猫尸体上进行后期，包括琥珀色。它的成本为5,000英镑 - 近7,000美元 - 全部在Gofundme上提出。辫子刘易斯得出结论，只有“大锋利的刀片”可以制作这种清洁的切口。他发现没有咬标记的迹象，这些标记会建议其他动物的捕食或清除。他无法确定地说，同样的手在整个十个案件中都挥舞着刀子，但他认为犯罪者的技能水平随着时间的推移而得到改善。琥珀在胸腔里有一个骨折脊柱和广义出血，这是他在他检查的许多其他动物中发现的钝力创伤的迹象。 Snarl认为这意味着杀手们将宠物困在死亡中，也许在用食物诱发它们后。辫子刘易斯也发现了琥珀的爪下的未知物质：她划伤了杀手吗？它可能含有DNA？</p><p>  According to Rising, Andy Tarrant, the borough commander for the Croydon police, initially refused to test the sample. He told her that Amber’s body had been handled by too many people to produce a conclusive result. When eventually it was tested, the material proved to be carpet fibers. (The Met wouldn’t let individual officers comment for this story.)</p><p>  据上升，安迪·塔兰特，克罗伊登警方的自治市镇指挥官，最初拒绝测试样本。他告诉她，琥珀的尸体被太多人处理了产生了决定性的结果。最终测试后，这些材料被证明是地毯纤维。 （遇见不会让个别官员对此故事发表评论。）</p><p>  Skeptical cops like Tarrant might have been reliving memories of Operation Obelisk, a four-month Met investigation in 1999 focused on a run of cat killings—it produced a frenzy of media speculation about satanic rituals, only to end with an announcement that, indeed, foxes had been scavenging roadkill. But even if the authorities got on board with SNARL’s hypothesis, the law didn’t exactly guarantee a harsh outcome if the killer was found. It’s not illegal to kill an animal; without carefully worded language, such a statute would have the awkward side effect of making every slaughterhouse the site of mass murder. Despite the UK having some of the strictest animal welfare protections in the world, the maximum sentence for cruelty is still only 51 weeks behind bars, a fine of £20,000 (about $27,000), or both. In practice, any sentence is usually six months or less, because crimes involving animal cruelty tend to be treated as minor offenses. The killer, if he existed, might be sued for criminal damages, as pets are property. From a police perspective, the prosecution options, let alone the evidence, didn’t merit the time or money that a serious investigation would require.</p><p>  像Tarrant这样的持怀疑态度，可能一直在重温操作方尖碑，1999年的四个月核查调查专注于一只猫杀 - 它产生了关于撒旦仪式的媒体猜测狂热，只会以宣布为止，实际上，狐狸一直在扫除路基。但即使当局载有Snarl的假设，法律并没有完全保证如果发现杀手凶手。杀死动物并不是违法的;没有仔细措辞语言，这样的规约将具有制作屠宰场的尴尬副作用。尽管英国拥有世界上最严格的动物福利保护，但残酷的最大判决仍然只有51周的酒吧，罚款20,000英镑（约27,000美元）或两者。在实践中，任何句子通常是六个月或更短的，因为涉及动物残酷的罪行往往被视为轻微的罪行。如果他存在，那么杀手可能会被起诉刑事赔偿金，因为宠物是财产。从警察的角度来看，检察选项，更不用说证据，并没有特别调查需要的时间或金钱。</p><p>  But members of the British public wouldn’t let the cat deaths go quietly. On SNARL’s Facebook page, people commiserated and provided comfort.</p><p>  但英国公众的成员不会让猫死亡悄然。在Snarl的Facebook页面上，人们独裁并提供舒适。</p><p>      “Run free at Rainbow Bridge poor puss” (a reference to “crossing the rainbow bridge,” a description among animal lovers of what happens when a pet dies).</p><p>      “在彩虹桥不糟糕的PUSS免费逃跑”（参考“穿越彩虹桥”，动物爱好者的描述在宠物死亡时会发生什么）。</p><p>  Some of the bereaved cat owners accompanied Jenkins, Rising, and a number of SNARL volunteers to an open Q&amp;A with the Met at Croydon College on the evening of Wednesday, December 2. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, commissioner for the whole of London, fielded questions on community matters as Tarrant moderated. When Tarrant announced that he was about to take the last question, someone pointed out that SNARL’s founders and supporters had had their hands up the whole time. Tarrant called on one of them. “Are you aware that someone is going around London killing cats, decapitating them, and leaving their remains to be found?” asked a SNARL volunteer. Horrified, Hogan-Howe said that he knew nothing about it and, according to Jenkins, shot an admonishing look at Tarrant. “Of course we need to take this seriously,” Hogan-Howe said, adding that someone who harmed animals might very well move on to humans.</p><p>  一些失去的猫主人陪同Jenkins，崛起和许多咆哮的志愿者到一个开放的Q＆amp;一个在12月2日星期三晚上的克罗伊登学院会议。伯纳德霍根豪尔·豪尔·豪尔·豪尔爵士，伦敦委员会主席爵士，关于社区的问题是坦率调节的问题。当Tarrant宣布他即将采取最后一个问题时，有人指出，Snarl的创始人和支持者整个时间都掌握了。塔兰兰人呼吁其中一个。 “你知道有人在伦敦杀死猫，斩首他们，并留下遗体吗？”问一个咆哮的志愿者。令人恐惧的是，Hogan-Howe说他一无所知，据詹金斯表示，令人信服地看看Tarrant。 “当然，我们需要认真对待这一点，”Hogan-Howe说，补充说，伤害动物的人可能会非常适合人类。 </p><p>  He was referring to a corner of what criminologists call the MacDonald triad. In a 1963 article entitled “The Threat to Kill,” New Zealand–born psychiatrist John Marshall MacDonald suggested that extreme animal cruelty is one of three adolescent behaviors that increase the risk of homicidal tendencies later in life. (The other two are obsessively setting fires and persistent bedwetting.) The FBI claimed to  corroborate the triad with case studies of serial killers, including Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer, who, among other malicious deeds, tortured animals as youths. Some criminologists now question the theory.</p><p>他指的是犯罪学家称麦克唐纳三合会的角落。在1963年题为“遭受杀伤的威胁”的文章中，新西兰出生的精神病学者John Marshall Macdonald建议极端的动物残酷是三种青春期行为之一，增加了生活后患者凶杀型倾向的风险。 （另外两个人痴迷地造成火灾和持久的尿床。）联邦调查局声称用串行杀手的案例研究证实了TRIAD，包括TED Bundy和Jeffrey Dahmer，他在其他恶意契约中，折磨动物作为青少年。一些犯罪学家现在质疑这个理论。</p><p>  Ten days after the Q&amp;A, a few dozen SNARL supporters and worried pet owners presented Tarrant with a petition signed by some 45,000 people. It called for a formal investigation of the cat killings. Tarrant informed the group that, as it happened, Met officers were now on the case. Operation Takahe, a name randomly generated by a computer program, had begun. Jenkins and Rising were invited to participate; the pet detectives were deputized.</p><p>  Q＆amp后十天; a，几十个咆哮的支持者和担心的宠物业主呈现了约45,000人签署的请愿书。它呼吁正式调查猫杀戮。 Tarrant通知小组，正如它所发生的那样，现在就遇到了会议官员。操作Takahe，一名由计算机程序随机生成的名称已经开始。詹金斯和上升被邀请参加;宠物侦探被遵守。</p><p>  Animals didn’t rule his life when Tony Jenkins first met Boudicca Rising. He’d had a fairly average pet quotient—two cats—when he was married and living in Stoke Newington, on the other side of London. Then his marriage fell apart, and he spent five years living in the spare room of his own home. He would leave the window open at night and wake up with “his cat”—Mabel—on his chest, after she’d returned from her nightly adventures.</p><p>  当Tony Jenkins首次遇到Boudicca崛起时，动物并没有统治他的生命。他有一个相当平坦的宠物商 - 两只猫 - 当他结婚并居住在伦敦另一边的斯托克·纽顿顿。然后他的婚姻崩溃了，他花了五年居住在自己家的备用房间里。他会在晚上留下窗户，并用“他的猫” - 在他的胸前，在她的夜间冒险之后，他的胸部。</p><p> “Morose and pissed” one night on Facebook, as Jenkins later recalled, he friended Rising—under her real name, not the nom de guerre she later adopted while battling animal abusers, in order to shield her from harassment and threats. With one marriage behind her and fresh out of another relationship, Rising was sick of “creeps” hounding her on social media. Based on Jenkins’s profile picture, she wrote him off. But the pair started chatting, and it became a regular thing. They had a natural affinity—“anti-racist, anti-fascist, kind of unconventional,” as Rising put it. She found his attitude refreshing. “He never tried it on, never showed any dick pics,” she said. They refrained from meeting in person—she wasn’t sure he was her type. Jenkins had his reservations, too. “You’re not going to turn me into some crazy animal-rights person, are you?” he once asked her.</p><p> 在Facebook上的一天晚上，“莫罗斯和生气”，因为Jenkins召回，他在她的真名上崛起，而不是她后来在战斗动物滥用者的时候通过的Nom de Guerre，以保护她免受骚扰和威胁。在她身后的一个婚姻和新鲜的婚姻之后，崛起厌倦了“蠕动”在社交媒体上欺骗了她。基于Jenkins的个人资料图片，她写下了他。但这对开始聊天，它变成了常规的事情。他们有一个自然的亲和力 - “反法西斯，反诉，一种非传统”，因为上升了。她发现了令人耳目一新的态度。 “他从未尝试过，从来没有展示任何鸡巴照片，”她说。他们没有见面 - 她不确定他是她的类型。 Jenkins也有他的预订。 “你不会让我进入一些疯狂的动物权利人，是吗？”他曾经问过她。</p><p> When they finally did meet, Rising consigned Jenkins to friends-with-benefits status, but by August 2012, she had to acknowledge that they were in a relationship. Finally divorced, Jenkins was looking for a house of his own. With London in its post-Olympics property boom, he realized that he would struggle to buy anything in the city’s north big enough to put up his two teenage sons when it was his turn with them. Down south, near Rising, houses were still affordable. The couple agreed that living in separate places worked best. “If we had an argument, I could just fuck off home, or she could. Job done,” Jenkins said.</p><p> 当他们终于见面时，将寄售的詹金斯寄给了朋友，福利地位，但到2012年8月，她不得不承认他们处于恋爱关系中。终于离婚了，詹金斯正在寻找自己的房子。与伦敦在奥运会后奥运会的繁荣中，他意识到他会在城市的北方努力购买任何东西，以便在轮流与他们转弯时伸出两个少女。向南，近崛起，房屋仍然价格合理。这对夫妇一致认为生活在独立的地方。 “如果我们有一个争论，我可以搞砸回家，或者她可以。 Jenkins说，完成了工作。</p><p> So Jenkins moved to south London—“the badlands,” as he called it—on December 21, 2012, the final day of a 5,126-year cosmological cycle in the Mayan calendar.  The world’s gonna end, of course it is, Jenkins remembered telling himself.  And I’m moving to fucking Croydon.</p><p> 所以Jenkins搬到了南伦敦 - “荒地”，因为他于2012年12月21日召集IT-It-It-It-in of The Mayan历法的5,126年宇宙学循环的最后一天。当然，世界的结局是，詹金斯记得自己告诉自己。而且我正在搬到他妈的克罗伊登。</p><p> Rising lived in the South Norwood neighborhood, and she was a regular in the pubs and shops of Portland Road, which is more lively and multicultural than the sedate streets of Addiscombe to the south. She had lived in the area since 1996, and one reason she had a big social network was that she’d been rehousing animals “for donkey’s years,” she said. “I never felt the need to call myself a rescue. It was just something I did.”</p><p> 崛起在南诺伍德街区生活，她是普罗特兰公路的酒吧和商店的常客，比南方的addiscombe的镇静街道更热感和多元文化。她自1996年以来一直住在该地区，她有一个大社会网络的一个原因是她一直在恢复动物“为驴的年份，”她说。 “我从未觉得需要召唤自己救援。这只是我所做的事情。“ </p><p> Rising found her way into activism in what was then a world capital of injustice: her birthplace, South Africa. Her father worked in the oil industry and tried to use his power to help others—he once shielded a white employee who was threatened with blackmail after marrying a mixed-race woman. Rising’s father also worked with rescue dogs and occasionally brought them home, including Pingo, a Keeshond mix who walked in circles. Pingo joined a couple of other dogs, plus Suzy, a cat, in the family’s brood of pets.</p><p>崛起的发现她进入活动中的行动主义，然后是一个不公正的世界首都：她的出生地，南非。她的父亲在石油工业中工作，并试图利用他的力量来帮助他人 - 他曾经屏蔽了一名白员工，在结婚混合赛的女人后被勒索受到抹黑的威胁。崛起的父亲也与救援狗一起工作，偶尔将它们带回家里，包括pingo，一把圈子的金龙混合。 Pingo加入了几只其他狗，加上一只猫，一只猫，在家庭的养宠物上。</p><p> Rising’s mother was an organizer for the apartheid opposition, the Progressive Federal Party. She also worked with the party’s Unrest Monitoring Action Group, which compiled statistics on state-sponsored violence in townships. Rising got a job with the group at 17, helping people escape the country and sheltering victims of police brutality. “It was really dangerous,” she said. “The only reason we didn’t die is because we were white and well-known.” After Nelson Mandela was elected, Rising moved to London for six months, hoping to take a break. She never left.</p><p> 崛起的母亲是种族隔离反对派的组织者，进步联邦党。她还与党的稳定监督行动集团合作，编制了乡镇国家赞助暴力的统计数据。上升了17岁的小组有工作，帮助人们逃离国家和庇护警察残暴的受害者。 “这真的很危险，”她说。 “我们没有死的唯一原因是因为我们是白色和众所周知的。”纳尔逊·曼德拉当选后，瑞星搬到伦敦六个月，希望能休息一下。她从未离开过。</p><p> And now she was dating Jenkins, who one night walked tipsily to her house after a night at the pub with a friend. A kitten had followed him.</p><p> 现在她正在约会Jenkins，一天晚上在和朋友一起度过一个晚上，有一天晚上倾斜地走向她的房子。一只小猫跟着他。</p><p>   “I bloody well know it’s a cat. But what’s it doing here?”</p><p>   “我血腥都知道这是一只猫。但它在这做了什么？“</p><p> It was an odd question coming from a woman who had nine of them. Despite their efforts to keep the kitten in the garden, it slipped past them into the house, hissed at the felines in residence, and made itself at home on Rising’s bed. Discussing the interloper the next morning, the couple noticed that it had no collar and hadn’t been microchipped. Rising speculated that it had escaped from a nearby cat breeder who refused to have her animals chipped—“in which case, fuck her.” If no one claimed the kitten, they decided that Jenkins would.</p><p> 这是一个奇怪的问题来自一个有9个的女人。尽管他们努力将小猫放在花园里，但它将它们倒入房子里，嘶嘶作响，在居住地嘶嘶作响，并在升起的床上坐在家里。第二天早上讨论了监视器，这对夫妇注意到它没有衣领并且没有微芯片。崛起推测，它逃离了附近的猫饲养员，他拒绝让她的动物切割 - “在这种情况下，操她。”如果没有人声称小猫，他们决定Jenkins会。</p><p> Jenkins named her Daisy. He felt guilty about leaving her alone in his house while he was working, so she was soon joined by Ozzy, a black rescue cat from east London. “I called him that because I liked rock music. The Prince of Darkness!” Jenkins said.</p><p> Jenkins叫她的雏菊。他觉得他在他工作的时候留下了一个人在他家里留下了罪，所以她很快加入了伦敦东伦敦的黑色救援猫。 “我打电话给他，因为我喜欢摇滚音乐。黑暗之王！“詹金斯说。</p><p> Rising was well on her way to making Jenkins a “crazy animal-rights person.” The next step was transforming him into a saboteur. Animal rights activists meet regularly in the winter months to disrupt countryside fox hunts, which still occur in the UK, despite having been banned in 2005. Some “hunt sabs,” as they’re called, sport a tattoo of a running fox. One of Rising’s friends asked if Jenkins would like to come along on a sabotage mission. After that, Jenkins spent many weekends in a Land Rover ferrying protesters around. They used horns and citronella spray to distract pa</p><p> 在让Jenkins成为“疯狂的动物权利人”的路上，崛起很好。下一步是将他转化为一个麻布。动物权利活动家在冬季定期相遇，扰乱郊区的狐狸狩猎，尽管2005年被禁止，但在英国仍然发生。一些“狩猎萨布”，因为他们被称为，体育一只跑狐的纹身。一个上升的朋友们问詹金斯是否希望在破坏使命。之后，Jenkins在陆路队渡轮渡轮抵抗时花了很多周末。他们用喇叭和柑橘菌喷雾来分散pa </p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://magazine.atavist.com/cat-and-mouse-london-serial-killer-snarl-slain-pets">https://magazine.atavist.com/cat-and-mouse-london-serial-killer-snarl-slain-pets</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/猫和老鼠/">#猫和老鼠</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/cat/">#cat</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
