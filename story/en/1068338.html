Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin scrambled to save faltering markets at the start of the pandemic last year, America’s top economic officials were in near-constant contact with a Wall Street executive whose firm stood to benefit financially from the rescue.</p><p>作为美联储椅子杰罗姆H.鲍威尔和财政部长史蒂文·穆契·斯图曼·穆契争先恐后地区在去年大流行于大流行于大流行开始时节省了摇摇欲剧的市场，与华尔街行政的近天联系，其公司从经济上抵销救援。</p><p>  Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, was in frequent touch with Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Powell in the days before and after many of the Fed’s emergency rescue programs were announced in late March. Emails obtained by The New York Times through a records request, along with public releases, underscore the extent to which Mr. Fink planned alongside the government for parts of a financial rescue that his firm referred to in one message as “the project” that he and the Fed were “working on together.”</p><p>  Laurence D. Flink是世界上最大的资产经理Blackrock的首席执行官，与Mnuchin先生和鲍威尔先生在3月下旬宣布的许多紧急救援计划之前和之后经常接触。纽约时报通过记录请求获得的电子邮件，以及公共发布，强调Fink先生与政府一起计划的程度，他的公司在一条消息中称为“项目”的财务救援人员美联储“一起工作”。</p><p> While some conversations were previously disclosed, the  newly released emails, together with public calendar records, show the extent to which economic policymakers worked with a private company as they were drawing up a response to the financial meltdown and how intertwined BlackRock has become with the federal government.</p><p> 虽然以前披露了一些对话，但新发布的电子邮件以及公共日历记录，展示了经济政策制定者与私营公司合作的程度，因为他们正在制定对金融崩溃的回应以及交织的黑德罗克已成为联邦的互联网政府。</p><p> Mr. Mnuchin held  60 recorded calls over the frantic Saturday and Sunday leading up to the Fed’s  unveiling on Monday, March 23, of a policy package that included its first-ever program to buy corporate bonds, which were becoming nearly impossible to sell as investors sprinted to convert their holdings to cash. Mr. Mnuchin spoke to Mr. Fink five times that weekend, more than anyone other than the Fed chair, whom he spoke with nine times. Mr. Fink joined Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Powell and Larry Kudlow, who was the White House National Economic Council director, for a brief call at 7:25 the evening before the Fed’s big announcement, based on Mr. Mnuchin’s calendars.</p><p> Mnuchin先生在疯狂的周六和周日举行了60名录得的呼吁，前往3月23日星期一的揭幕宣传，其中包括其第一次举办的公司债券的一份政策套餐，这些计划债券几乎不可能作为投资者出售冲刺以将他们的持股转换为现金。穆辛先生向先生讨论了芬克先生的周末五次，比除美联储椅子以外的任何人都超过了九次。 Fink先生加入了Mnuchin先生，鲍威尔先生，鲍威尔先生，他是白宫全国经济委员会主任，在美联储的大宣布前7:25的简短电话，基于Mnuchin先生的日历。</p><p>  The records reveal how often federal officials engaged with a Wall Street executive at a moment of crisis, as they strategized about how to turn around markets that were descending into chaos. Mr. Fink’s firm is a huge player across many stock and debt markets, and its advisory arm helped to execute some of the Fed’s crisis response during the 2008 financial meltdown. That market insight and experience got him a front-row seat at a pivotal moment, one that may have put him in a position to influence a rescue with huge ramifications for households, businesses and the entire U.S. economy.</p><p>  记录揭示了联邦官员在危机时期与华尔街行政部门进行的频率，因为他们对如何扭转被陷入混乱的市场战略。 Fink先生的公司是众多股票和债务市场的巨大球员，其咨询手臂在2008年财务危机期间帮助执行了一些美联储的危机反应。市场洞察力和经验让他成为一个关键时刻的前排座位，这可能让他能够影响救援，以影响家庭，企业和整个美国经济的巨大影响。</p><p> “They’re about as close to a government arm as you can be, without being the Federal Reserve,” said William Birdthistle, a professor at the Chicago-Kent College of Law and the author of a  book on funds.</p><p> “他们靠近政府武器，因为你可以在没有美联储的情况下，”芝加哥 - 肯特学院教授和一本资金书作者的教授威廉·普通威士尔说。</p><p> On March 24, 2020, the New York Fed announced that it had again hired BlackRock’s advisory arm, which operates separately from the company’s asset-management business but which Mr. Fink oversees, this time to carry out the Fed’s purchases of commercial mortgage-backed securities and  corporate bonds.</p><p> 2020年3月24日，纽约美联储宣布它再次聘请Blackrock的咨询部队，这些咨询部门又与公司的资产管理业务分开运作，但福克先生监督的是，这次举办美联储的商业抵押贷款购买证券和公司债券。 </p><p> BlackRock’s ability to directly profit from its regular contact with the government during rescue planning was limited. The firm signed a nondisclosure agreement with the New York Fed on March 22, restricting involved officials from sharing information about the coming programs.</p><p>在救援计划期间，Blackrock能够从与政府定期联系的能力有限。该公司与3月22日联合国联合国联合国公司签署了一项非歧视协议，限制了涉及官员分享有关即将到来的方案的信息。</p><p> But how the Fed and Treasury devised their rescue package mattered to BlackRock. The company makes a profit by managing money for clients in an array of funds, generally charging a preset fee. It earns more when assets under its management grow. In the early days of the coronavirus crisis, as people converted financial holdings into cash, parts of its asset base  were contracting and its business outlook hinged on what happened in certain markets.</p><p> 但美联储和财政部如何制定救援包才能追溯到Blackrock。该公司通过在一系列资金中管理客户的资金来赚钱，一般是收取预设费用。当管理层的资产增长时，它会获得更多。在冠状病毒危机的早期，随着人们将财务持有的现金转化为现金，其资产基础的部分是承包，其业务前景讨论了某些市场发生的事情。</p><p> While the Fed and Treasury consulted with many financial firms as they drew up their response — and practically all of Wall Street and much of Main Street  benefited — no other company was as front and center.</p><p> 虽然美联储和财政部咨询了许多金融公司，因为他们提升了他们的回应 - 以及实际上所有的华尔街和大部分主要街道受益 - 没有其他公司是前沿和中心。</p><p> Simply being in touch throughout the government’s planning was good for BlackRock, potentially burnishing its image over the longer run, Mr. Birdthistle said. BlackRock would have benefited through “tons of information, tons of secondary financial benefits,” he said.</p><p> Birdthistle先生说，即时在政府的规划中贯穿于政府的规划方面有利于黑石，潜在地吹过其形象。他说，Blackrock将受益于“大量信息，大量的次要金融福利”。</p><p> Mr. Mnuchin could not be reached for comment. Asked whether top Fed officials discussed program details with Mr. Fink before his firm had signed the nondisclosure agreement, the Fed said Mr. Powell and Randal K. Quarles, a Fed vice chair who also appears in the emails, “have no recollection of discussing the terms of either facility with Mr. Fink.”</p><p> Mnuchin先生无法达成评论。询问最高美联储官员是否讨论了福克先生在他的公司签署了非歧视协议之前讨论了计划细节，美联储表示鲍威尔和兰德尔K. Quarles先生，这是一位美联储副主席，他在电子邮件中展出，“没有回忆讨论与Fink先生的任何设施的条款。“</p><p> “Nor did they have any reason to do so because the Federal Reserve Bank of New York handled the process with great care and transparency,” the central bank added in its statement.</p><p> “他们没有理由这样做，因为纽约美联储银行以极大的照顾和透明度处理了这个过程，”中央银行在其发言中增加了。</p><p> Brian Beades, a spokesman for BlackRock, highlighted that the firm had “stringent information barriers in place that ensure separation between BlackRock Financial Markets Advisory and the firm’s investment business.” He said it was “proud to have been in a position to assist the Federal Reserve in addressing the severe downturn in financial markets during the depths of the crisis.”</p><p> Brian Beades是Blackrock的发言人，突出显示该公司有“严格的信息障碍，确保Blackrock金融市场咨询和公司的投资业务之间的分离。”他说，它是“自豪能够在危机深处解决金融市场的严重低迷时”为协助美联储“。” </p><p>  The disclosed emails between Fed and BlackRock officials — 11 in all across March and early April — do not make clear whether the company knew about any of the Fed and Treasury programs’ designs or whether they were simply providing market information.</p><p>在3月和4月初的All off off和Blackrock官员之间披露的电子邮件 - 不要清楚公司是否知道任何美联储和财务计划的设计或是否只是提供市场信息。</p><p> Emails indicate that Mr. Powell spoke with Mr. Fink on March 23, hours after the Fed announced its corporate bond program.</p><p> 电子邮件表明，鲍威尔先生在美联储宣布其公司债券方案宣布的公司债券方案后，3月23日在3月23日与Fink先生发言。</p><p> “Larry Fink is available to speak today regarding the project you will be working on together,” an email from Mr. Fink’s assistant directly to Mr. Powell said. “Please let us know if there is a convenient time for you.”</p><p> “Larry Fink今天可以发言关于你将在一起的项目，”Fink先生直接向鲍威尔先生的电子邮件发送了一封电子邮件。 “请告诉我们是否有便捷的时间。”</p><p>  The call does not appear on the  Fed chair’s official schedule from that March. Those calendars generally track scheduled events, and may have missed meetings in early 2020 when staff members were frantically working on the market rescue and the Fed was shifting to work from home, a central bank spokesman said.</p><p>  该呼吁不会出现在联邦政府的官方时间表上。一名央行发言人表示，这些日历通常会追踪预定的活动，可能会在2020年初发表在2020年初的会议。</p><p> Mr. Powell’s calendars did show that he talked to Mr. Fink in March, April and May, and he has previously answered questions about those discussions.</p><p> 鲍威尔先生的日历确实表明，他于4月，4月和5月与Fink先生谈过，他以前回答过关于这些讨论的问题。</p><p> “I can’t recall exactly what those conversations were, but they would have been about what he is seeing in the markets and things like that, to generally exchanging information,” Mr. Powell said at a  July news conference, adding that it wasn’t “very many” conversations. “He’s typically trying to make sure that we are getting good service from the company that he founded and leads.”</p><p> “我无法回答那些对话的谈话，但他们将是他在市场上看到的东西以及一般交换信息的东西，”鲍威尔先生在7月新闻发布会上表示，这补充说，这是不是't“很多”对话。 “他通常试图确保我们从公司创立和领导的公司获得良好的服务。”</p><p> BlackRock’s connections to Washington are not new. It was a critical player in the 2008 crisis response, when the New York Fed  retained the firm’s advisory arm to manage the mortgage assets of the insurance giant American International Group and Bear Stearns.</p><p> Blackrock的与华盛顿的联系并不新鲜。这是2008年危机反应的关键球员，当纽约美联储保留了该公司的咨询部门来管理保险巨头美国国际集团和熊架的抵押资产。 </p><p> Several former BlackRock employees have been named to top roles in President Biden’s administration,  including Brian Deese, who heads the White House National Economic Council, and Wally Adeyemo, who was Mr. Fink’s chief of staff and is now the No. 2 official at the Treasury.</p><p>曾经有几位前布莱克里波雇员被评为拜登总统主席，其中包括布里安·迪塞（包括Brian Deese），他是Wink官员首席先生的Wind Houst国家经济委员会和Wally Adeyemo，现在是2号官员财政部。</p><p> The firm has grown rapidly: Its assets under management swelled from $1.3 trillion  in early 2009 to $7.4 trillion in 2019. By the end of  last year, they were $8.7 trillion.</p><p> 该公司已迅速增长：其管理层的资产从2009年初的1.3万亿美元膨胀至2019年的7.4万亿美元。到去年年底，他们的价格为8.7万亿美元。</p><p> As it expanded, it has stepped up its lobbying. In 2004, BlackRock Inc.  registered two lobbyists and spent less than $200,000 on its efforts. By 2019 it had 20 lobbyists and spent nearly $2.5 million, though that declined slightly last year, based on OpenSecrets data.  Campaign contributions tied to the firm also jumped, touching $1.7 million in 2020 (80 percent to Democrats, 20 percent to Republicans) from next to nothing as recently as 2004.</p><p> 随着它的扩展，它已经加强了它的游说。 2004年，Blackrock Inc.注册了两个游说者，花费不到200,000美元的努力。到2019年，它有20个游说者，并花费了近250万美元，但去年略有下降，基于OpenSecrets数据。与公司的竞选捐款也跳起来，从近来的2004年开始，2020年（80％到共和党人）触及2020美元（80％到共和党人）。</p><p>  In March, as some of BlackRock’s own offerings were being rocked at the pandemic’s onset in the United States, the firm reached out to Mr. Powell and Mr. Quarles, the emails show. In one or two cases, BlackRock appears to have had phone calls with Mr. Quarles. In others, Mr. Powell and Mr. Quarles did not reply, based on the released records.</p><p>  3月份，由于Blackrock自己的一些产品在美国的发病中遭到震撼，该公司向鲍威尔先生和Quarls先生展示，电子邮件展示。在一两个案例中，BlackRock似乎已经与Quarles先生打电话。在其他人中，鲍威尔先生和Quarles先生根据发布的记录没有回复。</p><p> The firm’s representatives also talked to Treasury policymakers other than Mr. Mnuchin in March, the emails show. One former official said such calls were part of routine information-gathering from a big market participant when markets were rapidly falling apart.</p><p> 该公司的代表还与Mnuchin先生在3月以外的国债政策制定者谈到，电子邮件显示。一位前官员表示，该电话是当市场迅速分崩离析时，来自大市场参与者的日常信息收集的一部分。</p><p> BlackRock operates in  short-term debt markets that came under intense stress as people and companies rushed to move all of their holdings into cash. And problems were brewing in the corporate debt market, including in exchange-traded funds, which track bundles of corporate debt and other assets but trade like stocks. Corporate bonds were difficult to trade and near impossible to issue in mid-March 2020. Prices on some high-grade corporate debt E.T.F.s, including one of BlackRock’s,  were out of whack relative to the values of the underlying assets, which is unusual.</p><p> Blackrock在短期债务市场中运作，因为人们和公司赶紧将所有的持有人送往现金而受到强烈的压力。问题在公司债务市场中酝酿，包括在交易所交易资金中，这些资金跟踪公司债务和其他资产，但股票交易。公司债券难以在2020年3月中旬贸易和不可能发行的近代。关于一些高档公司债务的价格，包括Blackrock，其中一个，相对于潜在资产的价值观，这是不寻常的。</p><p> People could still pull their money from E.T.F.s, which both the industry and several outside academics have heralded as a sign of their resiliency. But investors would have had to take a financial hit to do so, relative to the quoted value of the underlying bonds. That could have bruised the product’s reputation in the eyes of some retail savers.</p><p> 人们仍然可以从e.t.f.s中拉动资金，这是行业和几位外部学术界都作为其弹性的迹象。但是，相对于潜在债券的报价，投资者将不得不采取金融袭击。这可能会在一些零售商的眼中造成产品的声誉。 </p><p> “This was the first time that E.T.F.s came under stress in a really systemic way,” said Gregg Gelzinis, associate director for economic policy at the Center for American Progress.</p><p>“这是第一次以一种真正系统性的方式遭受压力的第一次，”美国进步中心经济政策副主任Gregg Gelzinis说。</p><p> The Fed’s programs helped to turn that around. The central bank supported the corporate bond market on March 23, 2020, by pledging to buy both already issued debt and new bonds. The program for existing bonds promised to also buy E.T.F.s, because they are a quick way to get access to a wide swath of the market. The bond market and  fund recovery was nearly instant.</p><p> 美联储的课程有助于转变。中央银行于2020年3月23日支持公司债券市场，通过承诺购买已经发布的债务和新债券。承诺的现有债券的计划承诺也购买E.T.F.S，因为它们是获得市场宽带市场的快速方法。债券市场和基金恢复几乎即时。</p><p> When the New York Fed retained BlackRock’s advisory arm to make the purchases, it  rapidly disclosed details of those contracts to the public. The firm did the program cheaply for the government, waiving fees for exchange-traded fund buying and rebating fees from its own iShares E.T.F.s back to the New York Fed.</p><p> 当纽约美联储保留了Blackrock的咨询手臂购买购买时，它将迅速向公众迅速披露了这些合同的细节。该公司为政府提供便宜的方案，从自己的Ishares e4t.f.s从自己的Ishares of.t.f.s返回纽约送给纽约的汇款购买和退款费用。</p><p> The Fed has explained the decision to hire the advisory side of the house in terms of practicality.</p><p> 美联储解释了在实用性方面聘请房屋咨询方面的决定。</p><p> “We hired BlackRock for their expertise in these markets,” Mr. Powell  has since said in defense of the rapid move. “It was done very quickly due to the urgency and need for their expertise.”</p><p> “我们在这些市场中雇用了Blackrock的专业知识，”鲍威尔先生在辩护迅速举动时，鲍威尔先生已经。 “由于紧迫性和专业知识，它是非常快速的。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/economy/fed-blackrock-pandemic-crisis.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/economy/fed-blackrock-pandemic-crisis.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/consulted/">#consulted</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/先生/">#先生</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
