Indeed, such practices do have the  potential for such an awakening, allowing us to get more in touch with reality as it is  right here and now, including the qualities we don’t like about ourselves. Spiritual practices also have the potential to help us cultivate compassion, concern and unconditional positive regard toward others—things that can truly evolve our consciousness as a species.</p><p>  据称，诸如瑜伽，冥想和能量恢复等身心修养的益处在于，它们将帮助“使自我安静”，为崇高的自我提供有效的解毒剂。确实，这样的做法确实有可能唤醒人们，使我们能够与现实保持联系，包括现在和现在，包括我们不喜欢自己的特质。精神实践也有可能帮助我们培养对他人的同情心，关怀和无条件的积极关怀，这些东西可以真正发展我们作为一个物种的意识。</p><p>  However, this is all much easier said than done. As has been observed by many spiritual leaders, spiritual practitioners and psychologists over the years, the ego has an  incessant need to be seen in a positive light, and will eagerly hijack whatever flow of consciousness it can use for its own enhancement. As the Indian philosopher  Sri Aurobindo noted:</p><p>  但是，这说起来容易做起来难。正如多年来许多精神领袖，精神实践者和心理学家所观察到的那样，自我总是需要以积极的眼光看待自我，并将热切地劫持它可以用来增强自我的任何意识流。正如印度哲学家斯里·奥罗宾多（Sri Aurobindo）指出的那样：</p><p>  “At every moment [the seeker] must proceed with a vigilant eye upon the deceits of the ego and the ambushes of the misleading Powers of Darkness who ever represent themselves as the one source of Light and Truth and take on them a simulacrum of divine forms in order to capture the soul of the seeker.”</p><p>  “ [寻找者]在每时每刻都必须保持警惕，直视自我的欺骗和误导性黑暗力量的伏击，黑暗力量曾经将自己视为光明与真理的唯一来源，并采取了神圣形式的模仿为了俘获寻求者的灵魂。”</p><p>  Likewise, in his classic book   Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism , the Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader Chögyam Trungpa wrote:</p><p>  同样，藏传佛教精神领袖楚嘉·特伦帕（ChögyamTrungpa）在他的经典著作《切入精神唯物主义》中写道：</p><p>  “Walking the spiritual path properly is a very subtle process: it is not something to jump into naively. There are numerous sidetracks which lead to a distorted, ego-centered version of spirituality; we can deceive ourselves into thinking we are developing spirituality when instead we are strengthening our egocentricity through spiritual techniques.”</p><p>  “正确地走出精神道路是一个非常微妙的过程：这不是天真地跳进去。有许多偏向导致扭曲的以自我为中心的精神形态。我们可以欺骗自己，以为自己正在发展灵性，相反，我们通过灵性技术来增强自我中心。”</p><p>  Psychologists have also pointed out the potential for spirituality to serve as a tool of self-enhancement. According to  William James, the “father of American psychology,” any skill that increases its centrality in the self-system is likely to breed a bias toward self-enhancement. As it turns out, no domain of human skill has been found to be exempt from this “ self-centrality principle .” It seems to be an  inextricable part of human nature.</p><p>  心理学家还指出了灵性作为自我增强工具的潜力。根据“美国心理学之父”威廉·詹姆斯（William James）的说法，任何增加其在自我系统中的中心地位的技能都可能会滋生对自我增强的偏见。事实证明，没有任何人类技能领域可以豁免此“自我中心原则”。它似乎是人性不可分割的一部分。 </p><p>  This includes the domain of spirituality. Self-enhancement through spiritual practices can fool us into thinking we are evolving and growing, when in fact all we are growing is our ego. Some psychologists have pointed out that the self-enhancement that occurs through spiritual practices can lead to the  “I&#39;m enlightened and you&#39;re not” syndrome and  spiritual bypass, by which people seek to use their spiritual beliefs, practices and experiences to avoid genuine contact with their psychological “unfinished business.” In my recent book   Transcend , I call it &#34;pseudo-transcendence&#34;— transcendence built on a very shaky foundation.</p><p>这包括精神领域。通过精神实践的自我增强可以使我们误以为我们正在发展和成长，而事实上我们所成长的只是我们的自我。一些心理学家指出，通过精神实践发生的自我增强会导致“我开悟而你不是”综合症和精神绕道，人们试图利用他们的精神信仰，实践以及避免与心理上“未完成的业务”真正接触的经验。在我的最新著作《创见》中，我将其称为“伪超越”，它建立在一个非常不稳定的基础上。</p><p>  Just how much of a problem is all this, really? Perhaps on the whole, spiritual practices really do help quiet the ego, and  spiritual narcissism isn’t that widespread. What do the empirical data actually have to say on one of the greatest paradoxes of our time, which is:  If a major point of yoga is quieting the ego and reducing focus on self, why are there so many yoga pose pictures on Instagram?</p><p>  这真的是一个多大的问题吗？也许总的来说，精神实践确实有助于使自我安静，而精神自恋并没有那么广泛。关于我们这个时代最大的悖论之一，实证数据实际上要说些什么：如果瑜伽的主要目的是使自我平息并减少对自我的关注，为什么Instagram上有那么多瑜伽姿势图片？</p><p>    In the past few years, a number of high-quality studies have started to unearth the existence of spiritual narcissism and self-enhancement among spiritual practices that purport to  quiet the ego. In one  set of high-powered studies, Jochen Gebauer and colleagues looked at both yoga and meditation practices.</p><p>    在过去的几年中，许多高质量的研究已经开始发掘精神自恋和自我增强的存在，这些精神自负是旨在使自我安静的。在一组高水平的研究中，Jochen Gebauer及其同事研究了瑜伽和冥想练习。</p><p>  In their first experiment, they followed 93 yoga students for up to 15 weeks. They repeatedly assessed self-enhancement levels among people directly after participating in yoga and among people who had not practiced yoga within the past 24 hours. Self-centrality was measured by items such as &#34;Focusing mindfully on the exercises across the whole yoga class is...,” measured on a scale of 1 (not at all central to me) to 5 (central to me).</p><p>  在他们的第一个实验中，他们跟随93名瑜伽学生学习了长达15周的时间。他们在参加瑜伽后和过去24小时内未练习瑜伽的人中反复评估他们的自我增强水平。自我中心性是通过诸如＆＃34;专注于整个瑜伽课上的练习的项目来衡量的...''，以1（对我而言根本不重要）至5（对我而言至关重要）的量度。</p><p>  They measured self-enhancement though a standard measure of self-esteem, as well as by asking people the degree to which they perceived themselves as better than the average yoga student in their yoga class. They also included a measure of “ communal narcissism,” an often underdiscussed form of narcissism in which one thinks that they alone will save the world and that they are  the most helpful person of them all (e.g., “I will be well known for the good deeds I will have done”).  Research shows that communal narcissism is correlated with grandiose narcissism and all of the entitlement, arrogance and overconfidence that goes along with it (just applied to a helping domain).</p><p>  他们通过一种标准的自尊心来衡量自我增强，并通过询问人们他们在瑜伽课中对自己的感觉比普通瑜伽学生更好的程度来衡量自己。他们还包括了一种“自恋”的手段，这是一种经常被人讨论的自恋形式，其中人们认为他们一个人就能拯救世界，并且他们是所有人中最有帮助的人（例如，“我将以我会做的好事”）。研究表明，公共自恋与宏大的自恋以及随之而来的所有权利，傲慢和过分自信有关（仅适用于帮助领域）。</p><p>  The researchers found higher levels of self-centrality as well as self-enhancement (higher self-esteem, better than average judgments, and communal narcissism) among those who had just completed a yoga class compared to those who hadn’t engaged in any yoga class in the past 24 hours. They also found suggestive evidence that the augmented self-enhancement of the yoga practice played a key role in the well-being benefits of yoga through increases in self-esteem. This finding hinted at the idea that the well-being benefits of this spiritual practice may actually come through  boosting self-esteem, not through ego quieting.</p><p>  研究人员发现，刚完成瑜伽课的人比没有进行瑜伽的人更高的自我中心性和自我增强（更高的自尊心，更好的判断力和集体自恋）在过去的24小时内上课。他们还发现了暗示性的证据，即通过提高自尊心，增强瑜伽练习的自我增强能力对瑜伽的幸福感起着关键作用。这一发现暗示了这种精神实践的福祉实际上可能是通过提高自尊，而不是通过自我平息来实现的。</p><p>  In their second experiment, they followed 162 meditation practitioners for up to four weeks. They repeatedly assessed meditation’s self-centrality and self-enhancement directly after meditation and in the absence of prior meditation. This time, they directly measured well-being, including a comprehensive battery of measures of  hedonic well-being (happiness and high life satisfaction) as well as  eudaemonic well-being (higher levels of autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others, purpose in life and self-acceptance). Their self-centrality questions included items such as “How central is it for you to be free from envy?”; and their self-enhancement scale included items such as “In comparison to the average participant of this study, I am free from envy.” Again, they included a measure of communal narcissism.</p><p>  在他们的第二个实验中，他们跟随162名冥想练习者长达四个星期。他们在冥想之后和没有事先冥想的情况下直接反复评估冥想的自我中心性和自我增强。这次，他们直接测量幸福感，包括一系列享乐主义幸福感（幸福感和高生活满意度）以及过性幸福感（更高水平的自主权，对环境的掌握，个人成长，与他人的积极关系）。其他目标，生活目标和自我接纳）。他们的自我中心问题包括诸如“让你摆脱嫉妒有多重要？”等项目。他们的自我提升量表包括诸如“与这项研究的平均参与者相比，我没有嫉妒心。”再次，他们包括了一些自恋的措施。 </p><p>  The researchers found that, after meditation, self-centrality in meditation-relevant domains was exacerbated, not diminished, and self-enhancement in meditation-relevant domains was augmented, not curtailed. Additionally, increased levels of self-enhancement explained the effect of meditation on higher well-being (both hedonic and eudaemonic).</p><p>研究人员发现，冥想后，与冥想相关的领域中的自我中心性得到增强，而不是减弱，而与冥想相关的领域中的自我增强得到增强，而不是受到削弱。此外，自我增强水平的提高解释了冥想对更高幸福感的影响（享乐和过性）。</p><p>  It&#39;s important to point out that they sampled Western participants, and the yoga and meditation practices the participants engaged in—which included engagement in hatha yoga and loving-kindness meditation—don’t necessarily generalize to all yoga and meditation programs and practices. Nevertheless, the researchers did find greater self-enhancement in the yoga and meditation conditions even among very advanced mind-body practitioners. These findings suggest that, contrary to the purported benefits of mind-body practices as “quieting the ego” and reducing focus on self, they may actually  boost self-centrality and self-enhancement. Furthermore, and intriguingly, it seems as though it is precisely those self-related boosts that contributed to the well-being benefits of the spiritual practices.</p><p>  重要的是要指出，他们对西方参与者进行了抽样调查，参与者所从事的瑜伽和冥想练习（包括参与哈达瑜伽和爱心冥想）不一定必须推广到所有瑜伽和冥想计划中，实践。尽管如此，研究人员的确在瑜伽和冥想条件下发现了更大的自我提升，即使是在非常高级的身心练习者中也是如此。这些发现表明，与所谓的“安静自我”并减少对自我的关注相反，它们实际上可能会增强自我中心性和自我增强。而且，有趣的是，似乎正是那些与自我相关的推动作用为精神实践带来了福祉。</p><p>    In a more recent set of studies,  Roos Vonk and Anouk Visser conducted an exploration of “spiritual superiority.” They interviewed several psychologists, spiritual trainers and lay people, and asked them to describe people who use spirituality as a self-enhancement tool. They then translated these qualities to six items:</p><p>    在最近的一组研究中，Roos Vonk和Anouk Visser进行了“精神优势”的探索。他们采访了几位心理学家，精神培训者和外行人，并要求他们描述将灵性作为自我增强工具的人。然后，他们将这些品质转换为六个项目：</p><p>      •       I am more aware of what is between heaven and earth than most people.</p><p>      •我比大多数人更了解天地之间的关系。</p><p>  •       Because of my education and experience, I am observant and see things that others overlook.</p><p>  •由于受过的教育和经验，我很观察并看到别人忽略的事物。</p><p>  •       Because of my background and experiences, I am more in touch with my body than other people.</p><p>  •由于我的背景和经验，与他人相比，我与身体的接触更多。</p><p>  •       The world would be a better place if others too had the insights that I have now.</p><p>  •如果其他人也拥有我现在的见识，那么世界将是一个更好的地方。 </p><p>  In three studies, they assessed the relationship between their scale of spiritual superiority and other variables. In study 1, they focused on people who engaged in some form of spiritual training. Participants were recruited via mindfulness schools and energetic training centers, which aim to train skills that classify as paranormal, such as reading auras and regressing to previous lives. In studies 2 and 3, participants were recruited via a popular psychology magazine with a broad audience interested in psychological and spiritual development. The comparison was with people without any spiritual training.</p><p>在三项研究中，他们评估了他们的精神优越感规模与其他变量之间的关系。在研究1中，他们关注的是从事某种形式的属灵训练的人。通过正念学校和精力充沛的培训中心招募了参与者，这些中心的目的是训练被归类为超自然现象的技能，例如阅读光环和回归前世。在研究2和3中，参与者是通过一本受欢迎的心理学杂志招募的，其受众广泛，对心理和精神发展感兴趣。与没有受过任何属灵训练的人进行比较。</p><p>  Overall, the researchers found that the correlation of spiritual superiority with self-esteem was lower among the no-training group than those participating in any of the spiritual training groups. Their measure of spiritual superiority was related to “spiritual contingency of self-worth,” the degree to which people derive higher self-esteem from their spiritual practices (e.g., “I feel better about myself when I notice I develop myself spiritually”). According to the researchers, this illustrates that the self-enhancement function of spirituality is similar to other  contingency domains of self-esteem.</p><p>  总体而言，研究人员发现，在没有训练的人群中，精神优势与自尊的相关性低于参加任何一个精神训练组的人。他们对精神上的优越感的衡量与“自我价值的精神上的偶然性”有关，即人们从他们的精神实践中获得更高的自尊的程度（例如，“当我注意到自己在精神上得到发展时，我对自己的感觉就会更好”）。根据研究人员的说法，这说明了灵性的自我增强功能与自尊的其他偶然领域相似。</p><p>  Interestingly, their scale of spiritual superiority was more strongly correlated with communal narcissism than self-esteem, providing evidence for the notion of “spiritual narcissism.” Indeed, it’s important to distinguish between  healthy self-esteem and narcissism. The problem isn’t with self-esteem but with the   pursuit of self-esteem. Healthy self-esteem—comprising a positive evaluation of one’s self-worth and mastery—emerges naturally and organically through the engagement of authentic mastery and positive relationships, rather than by pursuing self-esteem as the goal. Increases in healthy self-esteem as a result of spiritual practices may be a good thing, and are not necessarily indicative of spiritual narcissism, which is why it’s good that the researchers were able to tie their measure of spiritual superiority to a specific form of narcissism: communal narcissism.</p><p>  有趣的是，他们的精神上的优越感与自恋比与自恋更密切相关，这为“精神自恋”的概念提供了证据。的确，区分健康的自尊和自恋很重要。问题不在于自尊，而在于追求自尊。健康的自尊包括对一个人的自我价值和掌握的积极评价，它通过参与真正的掌握和积极的关系而自然而有机地出现，而不是以追求自尊为目标。精神实践导致健康的自尊心增强可能是一件好事，并不一定表明精神自恋，这就是为什么研究人员能够将其精神上的优越感与一种特定的自恋形式联系在一起的原因：自恋。</p><p>  The researchers found differences depending on the form of spiritual practice, however. Spiritual superiority scores were consistently higher among those who came from energetic-training centers than the mindfulness trainees. In fact, those who underwent energy training were more likely to claim special knowledge of mindfulness, more so than those who were actually in the mindfulness condition! The energetic healers were also especially likely to score high in “supernatural overconfidence,” scoring high in items such as “When I randomly open a book on a page number that is meaningful to me, this is no coincidence,” “I can send positive energy to others from a distance” and “I can influence the world around me with my thoughts.”</p><p>  但是，研究人员发现差异取决于精神实践的形式。来自精力充沛培训中心的人的精神优越分数始终高于正念受训者。实际上，进行过能量训练的人比那些真正处于正念状态的人更有可能声称对正念有特殊的认识！精力充沛的治疗师尤其可能在“超自然的过度自信”中得分很高，在诸如“当我在对我有意义的页码上随机打开一本书时，这不是巧合，”中的得分很高。从远处传给他人”和“我可以用自己的思想影响周围的世界”。</p><p>  While their study is correlational, it&#39;s likely that there is a bidirectional relationship among these factors. It’s likely that spiritual practices can be used as a tool to bolster the narcissistic self, enhancing one’s feeling that one is special and entitled to special privileges. But it’s also likely that some spiritual training programs attract people with strong personal development goals that are related to Western narcissistic culture. As the researchers note, the idea of exploring one&#39;s own personal thoughts and feelings and becoming an “enlightened being” may be particularly attractive to people with high levels of both overt and covert narcissism.</p><p>  尽管他们的研究是相关的，但这些因素之间可能存在双向关系。精神实践很可能可以用作一种增强自恋自我的工具，从而增强人们对一个人的特殊感，并享有特殊特权。但是，某些精神训练计划也有可能吸引具有强烈与西方自恋文化相关的个人发展目标的人。正如研究人员所指出的那样，探索自己的个人思想和感觉并成为“开明的人”的想法可能对那些同时具有明显自恋和秘密自恋的人特别有吸引力。</p><p>    “Our results illustrate that the self-enhancement motive is powerful and deeply ingrained so that it can hijack methods intended to transcend the ego and instead, adopt them to its own service.... The road to spiritual enlightenment may yield the exact same mundane distortions that are all too familiar in social psychology, such as self-enhancement, illusory superiority, closed-mindedness, and hedonism (clinging to positive experiences) under the guise of alleged ‘higher’ values.”</p><p>    “我们的研究结果表明，自我增强的动机是强大而根深蒂固的，因此它可以劫持旨在超越自我的方法，而是将其奉献给自己。”。以所谓的“更高”价值为幌子，在社会心理学中非常熟悉的扭曲，例如自我增强，虚幻的优势，封闭的心态和享乐主义（坚持积极的经验）。”</p><p>    Is there any way around  the allure of spiritual narcissism? It’s all well and good that gurus espouse the importance of quieting the ego (often while driving in their Rolls-Royces), but in practice can we ever really override the universal self-centrality principle and transcend spiritual narcissism?</p><p>    精神自恋的诱惑有什么办法吗？上师支持安静自我的重要性（这常常很好）（但通常是在他们的劳斯莱斯驾驶时），但实际上，我们真的可以超越普遍的自我中心原则并超越精神自恋吗？ </p><p>  I think we can, but I believe the first step is simply awareness that it’s incredibly difficult to do so. One serious obstacle to healthy transcendence, as I see it, is how spiritual practices are “sold” to the masses. Yoga and mindfulness are big businesses in America. The purported benefits of mindfulness meditation have generated a billion-dollar industry (see  here,  here and  here). Yoga is  the most popular mind-body practice in Western societies. Many of these programs offer a long list of promises, including the reduction of stress and anxiety, along with greater confidence, creativity, focus, achievement, success, eating habits, sleep and even happiness.</p><p>我认为可以，但是我认为第一步只是意识到这样做非常困难。我认为，健康超越的一个严重障碍是如何将精神实践“推销”给大众。瑜伽和正念是美国的大生意。正念冥想的所谓好处已产生了十亿美元的产业（请参阅此处，此处和此处）。瑜伽是西方社会最流行的身心练习。这些计划中的许多计划都提供了很长的承诺，包括减轻压力和焦虑，以及更大的信心，创造力，专注力，成就，成功，饮食习惯，睡眠，甚至幸福。</p><p>  But here’s the thing: Healthy transcendence doesn’t stem from an attempt at distracting oneself from displeasure with reality. Healthy transcendence involves  confronting reality as it truly is, head on, with equanimity and loving kindness. As I put it in   Transcend , healthy transcendence “is not about leaving any parts of ourselves or anyone else behind or singularly rising above the rest of humanity. Healthy transcendence is not about being outside of the whole, or feeling superior to the whole, but being a harmonious part of the whole of human existence…. Healthy transcendence involves harnessing all that you are in the service of realizing the best version of yourself so you can help raise the bar for the whole of humanity.”</p><p>  但这就是问题：健康的超越并非源于试图分散自己对现实的不满。健康的超越需要面对现实，面对现实，保持冷静和仁慈。正如我在“超越”中所说的那样，健康的超越“不是要把自己或其他任何人抛在身后，也不是要超越人类其余部分。健康的超越并不是要在整体之外，也不是要超越整体，而是要成为人类整体和谐的一部分……。健康的超越需要利用您所拥有的一切来实现自己的最佳状态，从而帮助您提高整个人类的门槛。”</p><p>  This involves seeing reality as clearly as possible. As Nancy Colier, author of   The Power of Off: The Mindful Way to Stay Sane in a Virtual World  , notes, the point of mindfulness “is to be able to see what is happening inside ourselves, without ownership, judgment or action. And simultaneously, to lose our great belief in and reverence for the productions of our mind.... The dangerous habit is this: The mindful witness itself is becoming yet another form of ego, a new identity, a new somebody that we wear with pride.”</p><p>  这涉及尽可能清楚地看到现实。正如《断电的力量：在虚拟世界中保持健全的思维方式》一书的作者南希·科利尔（Nancy Colier）指出，“正念的重点是“能够在没有所有权，判断力或行动的情况下看到我们内部正在发生的事情。同时，要失去对信念的崇高信念和崇敬……。危险的习惯是：认真的证人本身正在成为另一种自我形式，新的身份，新的人。自豪。”</p><p>  Don&#39;t get me wrong: I genuinely enjoy looking at all the varied and intricate yoga poses on Instagram. But from my reading of the yoga literature, it doesn&#39;t seem as though the theoretical intent of yoga is primarily for physically attractive people to display with pride their ability to twist themselves into a pretzel. Rather, it seems that the most  growth-oriented benefits of mind-body spiritual practices occur when we aren’t using them as a tool for satisfying  any of our basic needs—such as our needs for security, belonging and self-esteem. Instead, such practices seem to lead to greater maturity, wisdom, compassion, acceptance and unconditional positive regard toward others when we repeatedly attempt to cultivate the ability to be witness to our mind and behaviors so that we can catch when our crafty ego has hijacked the system in a way that is detrimental to our own self-actualization and self-transcendence.</p><p>  不要误会我的意思：我真的很喜欢在Instagram上观看所有各种各样的瑜伽姿势。但是从我对瑜伽文献的阅读来看，似乎瑜伽的理论意图主要不是为了吸引身体上有魅力的人们以自豪的方式展现自己将自己变成椒盐脆饼的能力。相反，似乎当我们不将其用作满足我们的任何基本需求（例如我们对安全，归属感和自尊的需求）的工具时，心身精神实践的最以增长为导向的好处就会出现。取而代之的是，当我们反复尝试培养能够见证自己的思想和行为的能力，以便当我们狡猾的自我劫持了他人的能力时，这种做法似乎会导致更大的成熟度，智慧，同情心，接受性和对他人的无条件积极关怀。损害我们自身的自我实现和自我超越的方式。</p><p>  Which has me thinking: Perhaps it&#39;s time for all of these yoga and mindfulness centers to chill on all of the  extrinsic purported benefits they are claiming (“Better heath!” “Better sex!” “Amazing concentration!” “Great success at work!”), and just focus on the benefits of such spiritual practices for allowing us to realize that such concerns of the ego are just the ego doing its thing. That awareness, in and of itself, is enough of a benefit to last an enlightened lifetime.</p><p>  让我想到的是：也许现在是所有这些瑜伽和正念中心都应该利用他们声称的所有外在好处的时候了（“更好的健康！”“更好的性爱！”“惊人的专注！”“很棒在工作中取得成功！”），并只关注这种精神实践的好处，使我们意识到对自我的这种关注只是自我在做事情。就其本身而言，这种意识足以使一个开明的生命持续下去。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-science-of-spiritual-narcissism/">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-science-of-spiritual-narcissism/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/自恋/">#自恋</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/spiritual/">#spiritual</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/精神/">#精神</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
