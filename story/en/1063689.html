He felt constantly on edge, bracing for an attack. He got angry easily. He avoided thinking or talking about his time as a Marine; he tried traditional talk therapy, but didn’t feel ready to discuss his past.</p><p> 这是2013年冬天，经过三次伊拉克和阿富汗的四次旅游，Merkle先生在创伤后应激障碍的侵袭性症状中挣扎着。他不断地感受到边缘，支撑攻击。他很容易生气。他避免思考或谈论他作为海洋的时间;他尝试了传统的谈话治疗，但没有愿意讨论他的过去。</p><p> Months later, after his symptoms intensified and he felt desperate for a salve, he decided to give virtual reality exposure therapy a try at a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in Long Beach, Calif. The treatment uses V.R. technology to immerse a patient in a three-dimensional environment that mimics a traumatic memory. He strapped into a headset and sank into the past.</p><p> 几个月后，他的症状加剧后，他觉得牙齿绝望，他决定向加利福尼亚州长滩的退伍军人事务医院进行虚拟现实暴露治疗。该治疗使用v.r.技术将患者浸入模仿创伤记忆的三维环境中。他绑在耳机上并沉入过去。</p><p> The details in the simulation were extremely precise, Mr. Merkle said: the military-issue truck, the weight of the model gun in his hand, the dark swath of sand in the night. He narrated one particularly troubling incident out loud to a clinician, who adjusted the simulation as he spoke. “I was seeing that person shooting at me, that I hadn’t thought about in 10-plus years,” he said. His muscles tensed. His heart raced. He was terrified.</p><p> 模拟中的细节非常精确，Merkle先生说：军事发行卡车，他手中的模型枪的重量，夜间的沙子黑暗。他对临床医生大声讲述了一个特别令人不安的事件，他调整了他的谈话。 “我看到那个人在我身上射击，我没有想过10多年的想法，”他说。他的肌肉紧张着。他的心脏比赛。他很害怕。</p><p> “My body was physically reacting, because my mind was saying,  this is happening to us.” But when he took the goggles off, he said, the sense of accomplishment became its own form of comfort. For years, his memories had terrified him. Confronting the past in V.R. proved to him that he could survive revisiting his memories. “That was the biggest leap,” he said.</p><p> “我的身体在身体上做出反应，因为我的思想说，这是在我们身上的。”但是，当他拍下护目镜时，他说，成就感成为了自己的舒适形式。多年来，他的回忆吓坏了他。在V.R中面对过去。证明他可以在重新审视他的记忆中生存。 “这是最大的飞跃，”他说。</p><p> After about seven runs through the simulation, Mr. Merkle started uncovering fragments of memory his mind had blacked out, which is a common response to trauma. He remembered the name of the soldier who had been next to him in a truck during combat. He remembered the clear feeling that he was going to die. Mr. Merkle walked out in the hall after he was done, grappling with what his brain had revealed.</p><p> 在大约七次经过模拟后，Merkle先生开始揭开他的心灵黑暗的记忆碎片，这是对创伤的共同响应。他记得在战斗期间在卡车上旁边的士兵的名字。他记得他要死的清晰感觉。梅尔克莱先生在他完成后，在大厅里走出了大厅，努力与他的大脑透露的东西。</p><p> He felt like he was in a fantasy novel, he said. As he left the session, he imagined that “there was this black smoke pouring out of my mouth, oozing out of me. Like this evil, for lack of a better word for it, was slipping out” of his body. He got to the parking lot and sat in his car for an hour. The treatment was working, he thought. He was less scared of his memories, less scared of himself. He was getting better.</p><p> 他说，他觉得他是在一个幻想小说中。正如他离开会议的那样，他想象着“有这只黑烟从我的嘴里倾泻而出。就像这种邪恶一样，因为它缺乏更好的话语，就是“他的身体”。他到了停车场，坐在他的车里一小时。他认为，治疗正在运作。他不太害怕他的回忆，不太害怕自己。他变得越来越好了。 </p><p>  The most significant disorders that virtual reality therapy has shown success in treating — PTSD, anxiety, phobias — are on the rise. An April survey by the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cited  significant increases in respondents showing symptoms of anxiety disorders. Health care workers have reported high rates of PTSD during the pandemic — a  February study of 1,000 frontline workers reported that nearly one-quarter showed likely signs of the disorder. In contrast, only 6.8 percent of the general population ever experiences PTSD in their lifetime, according to  National Institute of Mental Health estimates.</p><p>虚拟现实治疗最重要的疾病在治疗 - 应激障碍，焦虑，恐惧症方面表现出成功 - 正在上升。疾病控制和预防中心的4月调查引用了患有焦虑症症状的受访者的显着增加。医疗工作者报告了大流行期间的高点PTSD  -  2月份的1,000名前线工人的研究报告称，近四分之一表明这种疾病的迹象。相比之下，据国家心理健康研究所估计研究所介绍，只有6.8％的一般人口在终身中经历了PTSD。</p><p> “Covid has been traumatizing to so many people in so many ways,” said Dr. Nomi Levy-Carrick, a psychiatrist who leads outpatient psychiatric services at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Grief, isolation, economic upheaval, housing and food insecurity, the “toxic stress” of lockdown and the  surge in domestic violence during the pandemic can all be traumatic stressors, she said. And the constant uncertainty of the past pandemic year created conditions for widespread anxiety.</p><p> “Covid在这么多方面都有如此多的方式创伤，”Nomi Levy-Carrick博士说，这是一个精神科医生，在波士顿领导的Brigham和女子医院带来门诊精神病院。她说，悲伤，孤立，经济动荡，住房和粮食不安全，住房和粮食不安全，锁定和家庭暴力浪涌的激增都是创伤的压力源。以及过去的大流行达的不变性不确定性为广泛的焦虑产生了条件。</p><p> Academics have studied virtual reality’s potential to treat anxiety disorders  since the ’90s, and the practice has incrementally gathered momentum, as the technology has improved and headsets have become more affordable. JoAnn Difede, a psychology professor at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York and one of the leading experts in virtual reality treatment for PTSD, said the headset she used for research with Sept. 11 survivors cost $25,000 at the time and weighed 10 pounds. Now,  an average headset retails under $300.</p><p> 学者已经研究了虚拟现实，自90年代以来对治疗焦虑症的潜力，并且这种做法逐步聚集了势头，因为该技术有所改善，耳机变得更加实惠。 Joann Difede是纽约的威尔康奈尔医学院的心理学教授，并为第400S的虚拟现实治疗领先的专家之一表示，她用于9月11日的研究令人留学员当时薪水25,000美元，重达10磅。现在，平均耳机零售价低于300美元。</p><p>  Recreational V.R. headset sales to the general public have grown during the pandemic, but the technology  has yet to fully enter the mainstream. Experts who study the therapy argue that’s about to change for the medical establishment, as clinicians look for effective and accessible ways to treat anxiety disorders.</p><p>  娱乐v.r.耳机销售向普通公众在大流行期间种植，但该技术尚未充分进入主流。研究治疗的专家争辩说，即将改变医疗机构，因为临床医生寻求治疗焦虑症的有效和可达方式。</p><p> Mr. Merkle likened his experience in the virtual reality simulations to a child confronting imaginary monsters in a closet. Each time you open the door, he said, you see there’s nothing to fear. Your body whirs down from fight or flight mode. And each time, the virtual reality treatment gets easier.</p><p> Merkle先生将他在虚拟现实模拟中的经验与衣橱里的虚构怪物面对的孩子。每当你打开门时，他说，你看到没有什么可担心的。你的身体从战斗或飞行模式下来。每次，虚拟现实治疗都变得更加容易。</p><p> Many V.R. therapies build on a  sometimes-divisive therapeutic technique called prolonged exposure, developed by Edna Foa, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. Prolonged exposure is a cognitive intervention therapy; patients first describe a traumatic event to a therapist, in detail and in the present tense, and then confront triggers of the traumatic event in the real world. While some experts have worried the practice might overwhelm or re-traumatize patients, prolonged exposure is now widely accepted as an effective tool to treat chronic PTSD. Patients become desensitized to their memories; they prove to themselves that their thoughts can be safe.</p><p> 许多v.r.疗法建立在有时分裂的治疗技术，称为延长曝光，由宾夕法尼亚州佩尔布尔曼医学院精神病学士学位发达的埃德纳FOA开发。长期暴露是一种认知干预治疗;患者首先将创伤事件详细描述为治疗师，并以现在的时态，然后在现实世界中对抗创伤事件的触发。虽然一些专家担心这种做法可能压倒或重新创伤患者，但现在广泛接受延长的暴露是治疗慢性病毒科目的有效工具。患者对他们的回忆脱敏;他们证明了他们的思想可以安全。</p><p> “If you overcome something in V.R., you overcome it in real life,” said Daniel Freeman, a professor of clinical psychiatry at Oxford University who runs virtual reality therapies at 10 public clinics across England.</p><p> “如果你在V.R中克服了一些东西，你会在现实生活中克服它，”牛津大学临床精神病学教授Daniel Freeman表示，在英格兰的10个公共诊所运行虚拟现实疗法。 </p><p> Direct-to-consumer virtual reality therapy products, for now, remain rare, and only a few are covered by insurance. Companies that sell V.R. therapy software often explicitly state their products should only be used in the presence of a clinician. Experts like Andrew Sherrill, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Emory University in Atlanta who specializes in virtual reality therapy., worry that, as virtual reality expands, people seeking treatment might try out a program for themselves and not consult a therapist. They might shrug off the treatment after not getting results or aggravate trauma symptoms. “It’s the closest thing our field has to just making opioids available over the counter,” he said.</p><p>目前，目前的消费者虚拟现实治疗产品保持罕见，只有少数人被保险覆盖。销售V.R.的公司。治疗软件经常明确说明他们的产品只应该在临床医生的存在下使用。 Andrew Sherrill等专家们在亚特兰大的埃默里大学精神病学助理教授，专门从事虚拟现实治疗。，担心，作为虚拟现实的扩大，寻求治疗的人可能会为自己试验一个程序，而不是咨询治疗师。在未获得结果或加剧创伤症状后，它们可能会耸耸肩。 “这是我们的领域最接近的东西，只是在柜台上提供阿片类药物，”他说。</p><p> “V.R. is not going to be the solution,” said Jonathan Rogers, a researcher at University College London who has studied rates of anxiety disorders during the pandemic. “It may be part of the solution, but it’s not going to make medications and formal therapies obsolete.”</p><p> “v.r.伦敦大学学院研究员Jonathan Rogers jonathan Rogers说，乔纳森·罗杰斯说，在大流行期间研究了焦虑症率。 “它可能是解决方案的一部分，但它不会使药物和正式的疗法过时。”</p><p>  Virtual reality treatments aren’t necessarily more effective than traditional prolonged exposure therapy, said Dr. Sherrill. But for some patients, V.R. offers convenience and can immerse a patient in scenes that would be hard to replicate in real life. For some people, the treatment can mimic video game systems they’re already familiar with. There’s also a dual awareness in patients who use virtual reality — the images on the screen are almost lifelike, but the headset itself functions as proof that they’re not real.</p><p>  Sherrill博士说，虚拟现实治疗不一定比传统的长时间暴露治疗更有效。但对于一些患者，V.R.提供便利性，可以将患者浸入现实生活中难以复制的景象。对于一些人来说，治疗可以模仿他们已经熟悉的视频游戏系统。在使用虚拟现实的患者中也存在双重意识 - 屏幕上的图像几乎栩栩如生，但耳机本身用作证明它们不是真实的。</p><p> Months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Dr. Difede and Dr. Hunter Hoffman, who is the director of the  Virtual Reality Research Center at the University of Washington, tested virtual reality treatments in one survivor with acute PTSD, one of the first reported applications of the therapy. Dr. Difede said that the first time the patient put on the headset, she started crying. “I never thought I’d see the World Trade Center again,” she told Dr. Difede. After six hourlong sessions, the patient experienced a  90 percent decrease in PTSD symptoms.  Dr. Difede later tested  V.R. exposure therapy in Iraq War veterans; 16 out of the first 20 patients no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD after completing treatment.</p><p> 9月11日之后的月份恐怖袭击事件，Difede和Hunter Hoffman博士，Whater of Washington大学虚拟现实研究中心主任，在一个急性PTSD中的一个幸存者中测试了虚拟现实治疗，其中一名第一次报道治疗的应用。迪维斯博士说，第一次患者戴上耳机，她开始哭了。 “我从未想过我再次看到世界贸易中心，”她告诉迪维德博士。经过六次举行的会议后，患者的目标症状减少了90％。 Difede博士后来测试了V.R.伊拉克战争退伍军人的暴露治疗; 16患者中，16名患者中不再符合完成治疗后PTSD的诊断标准。</p><p> At the University of Central Florida, a team called  U.C.F. Restores has been building trauma therapies using V.R. that allows clinicians to control the level of detail in a simulation, down to the color of a bedspread or a TV that can be clicked on or off, in order to more easily trigger traumatic memories. The program offers free trauma therapy, often using V.R., to Florida residents and focuses on treating PTSD.</p><p> 佛罗里达州中部大学，一支名为U.C.F.的团队。恢复已经使用V.R构建创伤疗法。这允许临床医生在模拟中控制细节水平，下降到床罩的颜色或可以点击或关闭的电视，以便更容易触发创伤记忆。该计划提供免费的创伤治疗，通常使用V.R.，佛罗里达州居民，专注于治疗PTSD。</p><p> Dr. Deborah Beidel, a professor of psychology and executive director of U.C.F. Restores, has broadened the treatments beyond visuals, customizing sounds and even smells to create an augmented reality for patients.</p><p> Deborah Beidel博士，一位心理学和U.C.F的执行董事。恢复，扩大了视觉效果外的治疗，定制声音甚至气味，为患者创造增强现实。</p><p> Jonathan Tissue, 35, a former Marine, sought treatment at U.C.F. Restores in early 2020 after talk therapy and medication failed to alleviate his PTSD symptoms, which included flashbacks, anxiety and mood swings. In the end, it was the smells pumped into the room while he described his military service to a clinician that helped unlock his memories. There was the stench of burning tires, diesel fumes, the smell of decaying bodies. He heard the sounds of munitions firing. His chair rumbled, thanks to the center’s simulated vibrations.</p><p> Jonathan组织，35岁，前海洋，在U.C.F寻求治疗。在谈话治疗和药物未能缓解他的应激疫症状后，在2020年初恢复，其中包括闪回，焦虑和情绪波动。最后，他将他的军事服务描述为临床医生，这是融入房间的气味，这有助于解锁他的记忆。燃烧轮胎的恶臭，柴油烟雾，腐烂的身体的气味。他听到了发射的声音。由于该中心的模拟振动，他的椅子隆隆声。 </p><p> “It unlocked certain doors that I could start speaking about,” he said. He talked through his newly uncovered memories with a therapist and a support group, processing the terror that had built in his body for years.</p><p>“它解锁了我可以开始谈到的某些门，”他说。他通过他的新未覆盖的回忆与治疗师和支撑群体谈话，加工多年来建造在他身上的恐怖。</p><p> Within three days, he said, he started feeling better; by the end of the three-week treatment, his symptoms had mostly faded. “It made me comfortable in my own self,” he said.</p><p> 他说，三天内，他开始感觉更好;到了为期三周治疗结束时，他的症状大部分都是褪色的。 “我自己舒服了，”他说。</p><p>  While a significant amount of funding — and consequentially, the bulk of research — on virtual reality’s therapeutic potential has focused on military veterans, “we’re ready for prime time to treat civilian trauma,” said Albert “Skip” Rizzo, a clinical psychologist who specializes in virtual reality and worked with Mr. Merkle at the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p><p>  虽然大量的资金 - 以及所在的研究 - 关于虚拟现实的治疗潜力的大部分研究 - “我们已经为军事退伍军人提供了重点，”我们已经准备好了治疗平民创伤，“临床心理学家艾伯特”跳过“Rizzo说谁专注于虚拟现实，并在退伍军人事务部门与Merkle先生合作。</p><p> Several companies and clinicians are using V.R. to treat other disorders. During the pandemic,  Johns Hopkins researchers have used it to reduce stress and burnout in medical workers. In one unpublished study, 50 nurses from a Covid-19 ward tested virtual reality mindfulness exercises — guided meditations beside animated fields and waterfalls — and all but one participant reported reduced stress levels.</p><p> 若干公司和临床医生正在使用V.R.治疗其他疾病。在大流行期间，约翰霍普金斯研究人员已经用它来减少医疗工作者的压力和倦怠。在一个未发表的研究中，来自Covid-19病房的50名护士测试了虚拟现实正常练习 - 在动画田间和瀑布旁边的引导冥想 - 以及一位参与者报告的压力水平降低。</p><p> Researchers are also testing whether they can alleviate childhood social anxiety with virtual reality programs, one of which uses animated artificial intelligence bullies that growl things like, “Give me your lunch money.” BehaVR, which currently sells therapeutic software on pre-loaded headsets to health care providers, plans to expand to direct-to-consumer products for social anxiety and other stress-related disorders, anticipating widespread post-pandemic fears, Aaron Gani, the company’s founder and chief executive, said in an interview.</p><p> 研究人员还在测试他们是否可以缓解童年社交焦虑与虚拟现实计划，其中一个人使用动画人工智能恶霸，这些人工智能恶霸咆哮，“给我午餐钱”。行为，目前将治疗软件销售给卫生保健提供者的预加载耳机，计划扩展到社交焦虑和其他与压力相关的疾病的直接消费产品，预期大流行后恐惧，公司的创始人亚伦Gani和行政长官在采访时说。</p><p> Virtual reality looks promising for treating phobias, according to Dr. Howard Gurr, a psychologist in Long Island, N.Y. He’s been interested in virtual reality for more than 20 years, since he saw Dr. Rizzo discuss a virtual classroom environment to diagnose and treat childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. But the technology has improved drastically in recent years, he said.</p><p> 根据长岛的心理学家霍华德Gurr博士的说法，虚拟现实看起来很有希望，纽约州的心理学家博士，他对20多年的虚拟现实感兴趣，因为他看到Rizzo博士讨论了一个虚拟课堂环境，以诊断和治疗童年注意力缺陷/多动障碍。但他说，该技术近年来急剧提升。</p><p>  In 2016, Dr. Gurr tried a simulation to treat patients’ fear of heights that convinced him of V.R.’s therapeutic potential. A glass elevator steadily rose over a city, the roofs of the buildings below growing smaller and smaller. A balcony appeared, and he was supposed to take a step onto it, over the chasm. Even though he didn’t have a phobia of heights, Dr. Gurr couldn’t do it. “Part of my brain was hijacked,” he said. “I was like, ‘I got it. This works.’”</p><p>  2016年，Gurr.博士尝试了模拟，以治疗患者对患者的恐惧，让他的v.r.的治疗潜力。一座玻璃电梯稳步上升了一个城市，屋顶下方的建筑物较小，更小。阳台出现，他应该在鸿沟中迈进它。即使他没有高度的恐惧症，Gurr博士也不能这样做。 “我大脑的一部分被劫持，”他说。 “我就像，”我得到了它。这是有效的。“ </p><p> Before he found virtual reality, Dr. Gurr would accompany a patient with a phobia of flying on an actual flight — a short distance, like New York to Philadelphia, over and over again. Now, he said, it’s more efficient and convenient to talk them through a virtual plane ride five or six times in a given session, on and off a pixelated runway. About one-third of his patients now come to his psychology practice specifically for virtual reality, he said, referred from other clinicians who don’t offer the treatment.</p><p>在他找到虚拟现实之前，Gurr博士将陪伴一个患者在实际飞行中飞行的恐惧症 - 很短的距离，像纽约到费城，一遍又一遍。现在，他说，通过虚拟平面骑在给定的会话中，开启和关闭一个像素化跑道，更高效和方便，通过虚拟平面乘坐五或六次。他说，大约三分之一的患者现在对他的心理学实践来说，专门针对虚拟现实，从其他不提供治疗的临床医生提到。</p><p> That number may grow as the pandemic wanes in the United States, he said, and more people grapple with its aftermath. He expects anxiety disorders will continue to rise, that the demand for effective treatments to tackle fear and trauma will only expand. Mr. Merkle, who’s in the process of getting a degree in clinical psychology, mostly relies on traditional talk therapy these days. PTSD has no clear end point; even in recovery, it can trap you, cycling and churning. But for now, he said, thanks to the V.R. treatment, he feels something close to free.</p><p> 他说，该数字可能会随着美国在美国的大流行运营，而且更多的人以其追随者挣扎。他期望焦虑症将继续上升，即对恐惧和创伤的有效治疗的需求只会扩大。 Merkle先生，在临床心理学中获得学位的过程，这些天大多依赖于传统的谈话疗法。 PTSD没有明确的终点;即使在恢复，它也可以捕捉你，骑自行车和搅动。但是现在，他说，感谢V.R.治疗，他感到靠近自由。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/03/well/mind/vr-therapy.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/03/well/mind/vr-therapy.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/治疗/">#治疗</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
