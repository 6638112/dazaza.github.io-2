Amid the pandemic, the already strained system lurched.</p><p> 每年，数十万名工人通过雇用和监测，纪律和火灾的巨大机制流失。在大流行中，已经紧张的系统蹒跚而行。</p><p>   Last September, Ann Castillo saw an email from Amazon that made no sense. Her husband had worked for the company for five years, most recently at the supersize warehouse on Staten Island that served as the retailer’s critical pipeline to New York City. Now it wanted him back on the night shift.</p><p>   去年9月，安卡斯蒂略从亚马逊看到一封电子邮件，没有任何意义。她的丈夫为公司工作了五年，最近在STENEN岛上的超级化仓库，作为零售商的纽约市的关键管道。现在它希望他回到夜班。</p><p> “We notified your manager and H.R. about your return to work on Oct. 1, 2020,” the message said.</p><p> “我们通知了您的经理和H.R.关于您在10月1日上班的回程工作，”消息表示。</p><p> Ms. Castillo was incredulous. While working mandatory overtime in the spring, her 42-year-old husband, Alberto, had been among the first wave of employees at the site to test positive for the coronavirus. Ravaged by fevers and infections, he suffered extensive brain damage. On tests of responsiveness, Ms. Castillo said, “his score was almost nothing.”</p><p> 卡斯蒂略女士非常令人难以置信。在春季工作的强制性加班时，她42岁的丈夫Alberto一直是该网站上第一波员工，以测试冠状病毒的阳性。他遭受了繁荣和感染，他遭受了广泛的脑损伤。关于响应能力的测试，Castillo女士说：“他的分数几乎没有。”</p><p>  For months, Ms. Castillo, a polite, get-it-done physical therapist, had been alerting the company that her husband, who had been proud to work for the retail giant, was severely ill. The responses were disjointed and confusing. Emails and calls to Amazon’s automated systems often dead-ended. The company’s benefits were generous, but she had been left panicking as disability payments mysteriously halted. She managed to speak to several human resources workers, one of whom reinstated the payments, but after that, the dialogue mostly reverted to phone trees, auto-replies and voice mail messages on her husband’s phone asking if he was coming back.</p><p>  几个月来，卡斯蒂略女士，礼貌，一点的物理治疗师一直在提醒公司，她的丈夫一直为零售巨人为零售业而自豪地进行自豪。响应令人沮丧和令人困惑。电子邮件和浏览亚马逊的自动化系统经常死亡。公司的福利是慷慨的，但她一直陷入恐慌，因为残疾支付神秘地停止了。她设法与几位人力资源工人交谈，其中一个人恢复了付款，但之后，对话大部分地恢复到她丈夫的手机上的电话树，自动回复和语音邮件，询问他是否回到了。 </p><p> The return-to-work summons deepened her suspicion that Amazon didn’t fully register his situation. “Haven’t they kept track of what happened to him?” she said. She wanted to ask the company: “Are your workers disposable? Can you just replace them?”</p><p>回归工作传票加深了她怀疑，即亚马逊没有完全注册他的情况。 “他们没有跟踪发生在他身上的事情吗？”她说。她想问一下公司：“你的工人是一次性吗？你能替换它们吗？“</p><p> Mr. Castillo’s workplace, the only Amazon fulfillment center in America’s largest city, was achieving the impossible during the pandemic. With New York’s classic industries suffering mass collapse, the warehouse, called JFK8, absorbed hotel workers, actors, bartenders and dancers, paying nearly $18 an hour. Driven by a new sense of mission to serve customers afraid to shop in person, JFK8 helped Amazon smash shipping records, reach stratospheric sales and book the equivalent of the previous three years’ profits rolled into one.</p><p> Castillo先生的工作场所是美国最大的城市唯一的亚马逊履行中心，在大流行期间取得了不可能。随着纽约的经典产业遭受大规模崩溃，仓库，叫做JFK8，吸收的酒店工作人员，演员，调酒师和舞者，每小时支付近18美元。通过新的使命感推动客户害怕亲自购物，JFK8帮助了亚马逊粉碎运输记录，达到了平流层销售和预订，相当于前三年的利润滚入一个。</p><p> That success, speed and agility were possible because Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, had pioneered new ways of mass-managing people through technology, relying on a maze of systems that minimized human contact to grow unconstrained.</p><p> 成功，速度和敏捷性是可能的，因为亚马逊及其创始人杰夫贝斯通过技术开创了新的批量管理人员的新方法，依赖于最小化人类接触的系统迷宫，以便不受约束。</p><p> But the company was faltering in ways outsiders could not see, according to a New York Times examination of JFK8 over the last year.</p><p> 然而，根据纽约时报在去年的纽约时报审查JFK8的纽约时报的纽约时报，该公司在局外人看不到的方式摇摇欲坠。</p><p> In contrast to its precise, sophisticated processing of packages, Amazon’s model for managing people — heavily reliant on metrics, apps and chatbots — was uneven and strained even before the coronavirus arrived, with employees often having to act as their own caseworkers, interviews and records show. Amid the pandemic, Amazon’s system burned through workers, resulted in inadvertent firings and stalled benefits, and impeded communication, casting a shadow over a business success story for the ages.</p><p> 与其精确的，复杂的包装加工相比，亚马逊管理人员的模型 - 非常依赖度量，应用程序和聊天行程 - 甚至在冠心病抵达之前甚至不均匀，并且员工经常必须充当自己的案例工作者，采访和记录表演。在大流行中，亚马逊的系统通过工人燃烧，导致无意中的射击和停滞不前的福利，并阻碍了沟通，对年龄的商业成功故事施放了阴影。</p><p> Amazon took steps unprecedented at the company to offer leniency, but then at times contradicted or ended them. Workers like Mr. Castillo at JFK8 were told to take as much unpaid time off as they needed, then hit with mandatory overtime. When Amazon offered employees flexible personal leaves, the system handling them jammed, issuing a blizzard of job-abandonment notices to workers and sending staff scrambling to save them, according to human resources and warehouse employees.</p><p> 亚马逊在公司前所未有的步骤提供宽大，但随时有时矛盾或结束它们。卡斯蒂略先生在JFK8的工作人员被告知要尽可能多地休息，然后强制加班。当亚马逊提供员工灵活的个人叶子时，系统处理它们的系统，向工人发出暴雪，向工人发出暴风雪通知，并将员工争抢宣传，以保存它们，根据人力资源和仓库员工。</p><p>  After absences initially soared and disrupted shipping, Amazon left employees mostly in the dark about the toll of the virus. The company did not tell workers at JFK8 or other warehouses the number of cases, causing them to worry whether notifications about “individuals” testing positive meant two or 22. While Amazon said publicly that it was disclosing confirmed cases to health officials, New York City records show no reported cases until November. The company and city officials dispute what happened.</p><p>  在缺席最初飙升和扰乱运输后，亚马逊留下了员工，主要是在黑暗中关于病毒的收费。该公司没有告诉JFK8或其他仓库的工人案件的数量，导致他们担心关于“个人”的通知是关于“个人”的态度意味着两年或22日。亚马逊公开表示，它透露了纽约卫生官员的确认案件，而纽约市记录暂无报告的案件直到11月。公司和城市官员争论发生的事情。 </p><p> Amazon continued to track every minute of most warehouse workers’ shifts, from how fast they packed merchandise to how long they paused — the kind of monitoring that  spurred a failed unionization drive led by frustrated Black employees at an Alabama warehouse this spring. If productivity flagged, Amazon’s computers assumed the worker was to blame. Early in the pandemic, the online retailer paused its firing of employees for low output, but that change was not announced clearly at JFK8, so some workers still feared that moving too slowly would cost them their livelihoods.</p><p>亚马逊继续追踪大多数仓库工人的每一分钟，从他们暂停的速度快速，他们暂停了多久 - 这种监测被激发失败的联盟驱动器，在这个春天的阿拉巴马州仓库中受到了沮丧的黑人员工。如果生产率标记，亚马逊的计算机认为工人应该责备。在大流行早期，在线零售商暂停了员工的低产量，但这种变化在JFK8没有明确宣布，因此一些工人仍然担心移动太慢的慢慢将其生计。</p><p> “It is very important that area managers understand that associates are more than just numbers,” an employee wrote on JFK8’s internal feedback board last fall, adding: “We are human beings. We are not tools used to make their daily/weekly goals and rates.”</p><p> “这是一个非常重要的是，地区经理了解联营公司的数字不仅仅是数字，”一名员工在秋天的秋季汇率上写道，补充说：“我们是人类。我们不是用来制作日常/每周目标和率的工具。“</p><p> The company touted breathtaking job-creation numbers: From July to October 2020 alone, it scooped up 350,000 new workers, more than the population of St. Louis. Many recruits — hired through a computer screening, with little conversation or vetting — lasted just days or weeks.</p><p> 公司吹捧令人叹为观止的工作创作号码：从7月到10月2020年，它畅销35万名新工人，超过圣路易斯人口。许多新兵 - 聘请通过计算机筛选，很少的谈话或审查 - 持续几天或几周。</p><p> Even before the pandemic, previously unreported data shows, Amazon lost about 3 percent of its hourly associates each week, meaning the turnover among its work force was roughly 150 percent a year. That rate,  almost double that of the retail and logistics industries, has made some executives worry about running out of workers across America.</p><p> 甚至在大流行，以前未报告的数据显示之前，亚马逊每周丢失约3％的小时员工，这意味着其劳动力之间的营业额大约是每年150％。该速度，零售和物流行业的速度几乎是两倍，使一些高管担心跨越美国的工人。</p><p> In documenting the untold story of how the pandemic exposed the power and peril of Amazon’s employment system, reporters interviewed nearly 200 current and former employees, from new hires at the JFK8 bus stop to back-office workers overseas to managers on Staten Island and in Seattle. The Times also reviewed company documents, legal filings and government records, as well as posts from warehouse feedback boards that served as a real-time ticker of worker concerns.</p><p> 在记录大流行风险如何暴露亚马逊的就业制度的权力和危险的情况下，记者采访了近200名现任和前雇员，从JFK8巴士站到了海外的后勤工作人员到了Staten Island和西雅图的经理。次时报还审查了公司文件，法律申请和政府记录，以及仓库反馈委员会的帖子，作为工人关注的实时股票。</p><p>  This April, Mr. Bezos said he was proud of the company’s work culture, the “achievable” productivity goals, the pay and benefits. In interviews, the head of human resources for warehouses and the general manager of JFK8 said that the company prioritized employee welfare, noted that it had expanded its H.R. staff and cited internal surveys showing high worker satisfaction. Some managers from JFK8 and beyond described building deep relationships with their teams.</p><p>  今年4月，贝佐斯先生说，他为公司的工作文化感到自豪，“可实现的”生产力目标，薪酬和福利。在采访中，仓库和JFK8总经理人力资源负责人表示，该公司优先考虑员工福利，并指出它已经扩大了其H.R.员工，并引用了展示高级工作人员的内部调查。来自JFK8的一些管理人员及以外地描述了与他们的团队建立了深厚的关系。</p><p> Amazon acknowledged some issues with inadvertent firings, loss of benefits, job abandonment notices and leaves, but declined to disclose how many people were affected. Kelly Nantel, a spokeswoman, suggested that those problems and some others chronicled in this article were outliers.</p><p> 亚马逊承认有些问题，无意中的火灾，丧失福利，工作放弃通知和叶子，但拒绝透露有多少人受到影响。发言人Kelly Nantel建议那些问题和其他一些在本文中复杂的问题是异常值。 </p><p> Ofori Agboka, the H.R. leader, noted that social distancing and masking had made it harder to engage employees in personal ways during the pandemic. Still, he said, “98 percent of everything’s going great — people are having the right experiences,” getting the help they need when they want it.</p><p>H.R.领导者的Ofori Agboka指出，社会疏散和掩蔽使得在大流行期间以个人方式聘用员工。他说，“98％的一切都是伟大的 - 人们正在拥有正确的经历，”在他们想要的时候得到他们需要的帮助。</p><p> But several former executives who helped design Amazon’s systems, and still call themselves admirers of the company, said the high turnover, pressure over productivity and consequences of scaling up have become too critical to ignore. The company has not ambitiously addressed those issues, said Paul Stroup, who until recently led corporate teams devoted to understanding warehouse workers.</p><p> 但是有几位前高管帮助设计亚马逊的系统，仍然称自己是公司的崇拜者，表示高营业额，压力过度的生产力和扩大的后果对忽视的影响太为严重。本公司尚未展示这些问题，说保罗·特罗，曾最近领导致力于了解仓库工人的公司团队。</p><p> “Amazon can solve pretty much any problem it puts its mind behind,” he said in an interview. The human resources division, though, had nowhere near the focus, rigor and investment of Amazon’s logistical operations, where he had previously worked. “It felt like I was in a different company,” he said.</p><p> “亚马逊可以解决它的任何问题，它在接受采访时说。但是，人力资源部门靠近亚马逊的重点，严谨和投资，他以前工作过。 “它觉得我在一个不同的公司中，”他说。</p><p> David Niekerk, a former Amazon vice president who built the warehouse human resources operations, said that some problems stemmed from ideas the company had developed when it was much smaller. Mr. Bezos did not want an entrenched work force, calling it “a march to mediocrity,” Mr. Niekerk recalled, and saw low-skilled jobs as relatively short-term. As Amazon rapidly grew, Mr. Niekerk said, its policies were harder to implement with fairness and care. “It is just a numbers game in many ways,” he said. “The culture gets lost.”</p><p> 亚马逊建立仓库资源运营的前亚马逊副总裁David Niekerk表示，一些问题源于公司在较小的时候开发的想法。贝佐斯先生并不希望被根深蒂固的劳动力，称为“三月到平庸”，尼克克先生召回，并看到低技能的工作，相对短期。正如亚马逊迅速增长的那样，Niekerk先生说，其政策更加努力地实施公平和护理。 “这只是一个数字游戏，”他说。 “文化迷失了。”</p><p>  Even Mr. Bezos, in his final lap as chief executive of the company he created, is now making startling concessions about the system he invented. In a recent letter to shareholders, he said the union effort showed that “we need a better vision for how we create value for employees — a vision for their success.”</p><p>  即使是Bezos先生，他的最后一圈是他所创造的公司首席执行官，现在正在令他令人意外的让他发明的系统的让步。在最近给股东的一封信中，他表示，联盟的努力表明，“我们需要更好的愿景，了解我们如何为员工创造价值 - 这是他们成功的愿景。”</p><p> “We have always wanted to be Earth’s most customer-centric company,” he wrote. Now, he added, “we are going to be Earth’s best employer and Earth’s  safest place to work.”</p><p> “我们一直想成为地球最客户的公司，”他写道。现在，他补充说：“我们将成为地球最好的雇主和地球最安全的工作地点。”</p><p> Amazon is also  on pace to become the nation’s largest private employer within a year or two, as it continues expanding. About a million people in the United States, most of them hourly workers, now rely on the company’s wages and benefits. Many describe the job as rewarding. Adama Ndoye had supported her family on her JFK8 pay while attending college remotely. “Lights on, food, clothes, everything,” she said. Dawn George, a chef, said she was grateful to JFK8 for taking her in after hotel kitchen jobs disappeared last spring. “I’m willing to work my socks off just for an hourly income,” she said.</p><p> 亚马逊也在步伐上成为全国最大的私人雇主，因为它继续扩大。大约一百万人在美国，他们中的大多数小时工人，现在依靠公司的工资和福利。许多人描述了奖励的工作。 adama ndoye在远程学院的同时支持她的家人，她的JFK8支付。 “灯，食物，衣服，一切，”她说。一位厨师黎明乔治表示，她感谢JFK8在酒店厨房工作消失后迎接她的赛后。 “我愿意为每小时的收入脱掉袜子，”她说。 </p><p> Some admire Amazon’s ambition. “It was like being a pitcher on a team that had a game every night,” said Dan Cavagnaro, who started at JFK8 when it opened in 2018 and worked with Mr. Castillo.</p><p>有些人钦佩亚马逊的野心。 “这就像是每晚有一场比赛的球队中的投手，”丹卡克纳罗说，他于2018年开业并与卡斯蒂略先生合作。</p><p>  But Mr. Cavagnaro was mistakenly fired in July while trying to return from leave, and could not reach anyone to help.</p><p>  但是，卡格纳罗先生在7月份被错误地解雇，同时试图从休假回来，无法与任何人一起帮助。</p><p> “Please note the following,” he wrote in his final, unanswered email plea. “I WISH TO REMAIN EMPLOYED WITH AMAZON.”</p><p> “请注意以下内容，”他在最终的未解决电子邮件请求中写道。 “我希望留在亚马逊。”</p><p>   In late March 2020, Traci Weishalla walked the length of JFK8, forgoing the fluorescent vest that marked her as a manager. She wanted an unfiltered look at what she would soon be helping to oversee: a warehouse the size of 15 football fields, serving America’s largest metropolis just as it was becoming the national epicenter of the pandemic.</p><p>   在2020年3月下旬，Traci Weishalla走了JFK8的长度，将标志着她作为经理标志着她的荧光背心。她想要一个未经过滤的看看她很快就会帮助监督：一个仓库的大小为15个足球场，服务于美国最大的大都市，就像它成为大流行的国家震中。</p><p> The noise, from conveyor belts whipping around packages, was like the roar of an oncoming subway train. Built to conquer the most lucrative market in the country, the facility ran almost 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p><p> 来自围绕包裹鞭打的传送带的噪音就像迎面而来的地铁列车的咆哮。建造以征服该国最有利可图的市场，设施每周七天凌晨24小时跑。</p><p> Ms. Weishalla had helped open the warehouse a year and a half earlier, and now — as homebound customers across the nation  clamored for thermometers, disinfectant and puzzles — she saw opportunity and purpose in her return as assistant general manager. For an organization that dealt in logistical miracles, the coronavirus was just another obstacle to overcome, she said.</p><p> 魏斯巴拉女士帮助开设了一年半的仓库，现在 - 作为全国的家庭客户，克制了温度计，消毒剂和谜题 - 她在她的回归作为助理总经理中看到了机会和目的。她说，对于处理物流奇迹的组织，冠状病毒只是克服的另一个障碍。</p><p> “That’s what we do,” Ms. Weishalla, 38, explained later. “We work to figure out the impossible problems.”</p><p> “这就是我们所做的，”威士那女士，38岁以后解释。 “我们努力弄清楚不可能的问题。” </p><p>  But Amazon’s mighty system was lurching. Semi trucks sat at warehouses around the country, without enough workers to unload them. Customers discovered that items the company had deemed nonessential might take a month to arrive — an eternity for a business that had routinely delivered within two days.</p><p>但亚马逊的强大系统很懒散。半卡车坐在全国各地的仓库，没有足够的工人卸下它们。客户发现，公司被视为非无需的物品可能需要一个月到达 - 这是一个在两天内经常交付的企业的永恒。</p><p>   To lure them back, Amazon offered a temporary $2-an-hour raise, double pay for overtime and, for the first time, unlimited unpaid time off. Executives thought that workers should be able to stay home without fear of being fired, and that with greater flexibility, some might still come in for part of a shift, according to two people familiar with the decision. (Like some other senior leaders in this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment.)</p><p>   为了引诱他们，亚马逊提供临时2美元的时间提高，加班费双重支付，并首次无限制地休息。高管认为工人们应该能够在没有害怕被解雇的情况下留在家，并且具有更大的灵活性，据熟悉该决定的两个人表示，有些人可能仍然可以参加部分转变。 （就像本文中的其他一些高级领导人一样，他们就匿名的条件谈到了，因为他们没有被授权发表评论。）</p><p>  Across the country, almost a third of Amazon’s 500,000 workers were staying home. Some new hires abandoned jobs before they even began, according to former recruiters. JFK8 “was like a ghost town,” recalled Arthur Turner, a worker who remained.</p><p>  在全国各地，亚马逊50,000名工人的近三分之一都在家。据前招聘人员表示，一些新的雇用在他们甚至开始之前被遗弃的工作。 JFK8“就像一个鬼城”，留下了一名留下的工人亚瑟特·特纳。</p><p> Even Alberto Castillo considered staying home. The numbers on the news were unfathomable: at least 20,000 New Yorkers already infected, city hospitals jammed, as many as 1.7 million deaths projected nationwide.</p><p> 甚至阿尔贝托卡斯蒂略也被认为是住宅。新闻的数字是不可思议的：至少有20,000名已经感染的纽约人，城市医院卡住了，全国预测了170万人死亡。</p><p> But this was no time to go without his income: The Castillos, immigrants from the Philippines, yearned to buy a house. He worked nights, troubleshooting and training with gentle mastery, frequent jokes and “Star Wars” references, colleagues said, and he had just applied for a promotion.</p><p> 但这是没有收入的没有时间：卡斯蒂利洛斯，来自菲律宾的移民，渴望买房子。同事们说，他在夜间，故障排除和训练，经常掌握，经常笑话和“星球大战”的参考文献，他刚刚申请了促销活动。</p><p> JFK8 was also giving contradictory instructions: Despite Amazon’s promise of unpaid time off, workers were alerted that every department would be on mandatory overtime.</p><p> JFK8也在给予矛盾的指示：尽管亚马逊承诺未付休假的承诺，但工人得到了认知每个部门的强制性加班。</p><p> When Mr. Castillo arrived on March 24, he heard the warehouse had its first positive case. He messaged his boss, who replied, “Yes, forgot to bring that up,” and added that everyone who worked with the employee had been notified. Mr. Castillo called his wife to discuss whether to head home. They decided he would finish out his shift.</p><p> 当卡斯蒂略先生于3月24日抵达时，他听到仓库有第一个积极案例。他让他的老板搞砸了，谁回答说，“是的，忘了带上这一点，”并补充说，在雇员合作的每个人都得到了通知。卡斯蒂略先生称他的妻子讨论是否回家。他们决定完成他的转变。 </p><p>    That morning, two workers drove in the opposite direction, beelined to JFK8’s break room and told dozens of colleagues: The virus had breached the warehouse, Amazon could not be trusted to tell them the truth and the facility should be shut down.</p><p>那天早上，两名工人沿着相反的方向开车，杰出的休息室，并告诉了几十个同事：病毒已经违反了仓库，亚马逊不能值得信任，告诉他们真理，设施应该被关闭。</p><p> Derrick Palmer and Chris Smalls, Amazon teammates and best friends, weren’t part of any formal effort. Their employer considered unionization a dire threat, and had even backed out of building a second headquarters in New York  in part over potential labor-organizing plans. A  retail workers’ union had once boldly declared that JFK8 would become the first unionized Amazon warehouse in the country, but the effort had died.</p><p> 德里克·帕尔默和克里斯·小型，亚马逊队友和最好的朋友，并不是任何正式努力的一部分。他们的雇主认为工会是一个可怕的威胁，甚至在潜在的劳动组织计划方面支持在纽约的第二次总部。零售工人联盟曾经大胆地宣布，JFK8将成为该国的第一联盟亚马逊仓库，但努力已经死亡。</p><p> Both men had been at Amazon since 2015 and knew the company from the lowest rungs. Mr. Palmer, then 31, was observant and deliberate, so fit that he often headed to the gym after a 10-hour shift. After dropping out of community college, he worked in a string of warehouses, joined Amazon and was now a “picker” at JFK8, pulling products off robotic shelves. He often produced top numbers on the software that tracked productivity, and had been selected to train others and help open a warehouse in Illinois.</p><p> 自2015年以来，两名男子都在亚马逊，并从最低梯级上了解公司。帕尔默先生，那么31，令人患观察者和故意，如此适合他经常在10小时轮班后去健身房。在放弃社区学院后，他在一串仓库工作，加入了亚马逊，现在是JFK8的“选择器”，将产品从机器人架上拉动。他经常在跟踪生产力的软件上生产顶部数字，并被选择培训其他人并帮助伊利诺伊州的仓库。</p><p> He also felt let down, believing that Amazon’s towering success didn’t accrue to workers like him. Employees felt managed largely by app, algorithm and strict but poorly explained rules, he said. When he met Ms. Weishalla at a 2019 session for workers to share feedback, he said, he requested more human interaction from management and told her he aspired to a job like hers. But he saw no changes. “If we go beyond the requirements, there’s no reward,” he said in an interview.</p><p> 他也觉得让人失望，相信亚马逊的耸立成功并没有给像他这样的工人累积。他说，员工在很大程度上受到应用程序，算法和严格但解释的规则很差。他说，当他在2019年举行2019年举行的卫生部遇到威士拉女士时，他说，他说，他要求更多人类互动管理，并告诉她，他渴望像她一样的工作。但他没有看到没有变化。 “如果我们超越要求，就没有奖励，”他在采访时说。</p><p>  When Mr. Palmer last sought a promotion, in early 2020, he was among 382 people who applied for the position. Though he didn’t know it, the odds were steep by design, an outgrowth of Mr. Bezos’ management philosophies.</p><p>  当帕尔默先生上次寻求促销时，在2020年初，他是申请该职位的382人中。虽然他不知道它，但是巨大的设计是陡峭的，贝佐斯先生的管理理念。</p><p> Amazon intentionally limited upward mobility for hourly workers, said Mr. Niekerk, the former H.R. vice president who retired in 2016 after nearly 17 years at the company. Dave Clark, then head of operations, had shot down his proposal around 2014 to create more leadership roles for hourly employees, similar to noncommissioned officers in the military, he recalled.</p><p> 亚马逊故意有限于每小时工人的移动性，前者是杰克克先生，前任于2016年在本公司近17年后退休。随后戴夫克拉克经营主管，左右掀起了他的建议，左右占据了每小时员工的更多领导作用，类似于军队中的非议长，他回忆道。</p><p> Instead, Mr. Clark, who is now chief executive of Amazon’s consumer business, wanted to double down on hiring “wicked smart” frontline managers straight out of college, Mr. Niekerk said. By contrast, more than 75 percent of managers in Walmart’s U.S. stores started as hourly employees. Following a pattern across Amazon, JFK8 promoted 220 people last year among its more than 5,000 employees, a rate that is less than half of Walmart’s.</p><p> 相反，克拉克先生是亚马逊的消费者业务的首席执行官，希望在聘请“邪恶的智慧”前线管理人员直接出于大学，纳基克说。相比之下，沃尔玛美国商店的超过75％的经理开始作为每小时员工。在亚马逊的模式之后，JFK8去年在其超过5000名员工中推动了220人，这是沃尔玛的一半的速度。 </p><p> Amazon’s founder didn’t want hourly workers to stick around for long, viewing “a large, disgruntled” work force as a threat, Mr. Niekerk recalled. Company data showed that most employees became less eager over time, he said, and Mr. Bezos believed that people were inherently lazy. “What he would say is that our nature as humans is to expend as little energy as possible to get what we want or need.” That conviction was  embedded throughout the business, from the ease of instant ordering to the pervasive use of data to get the most out of employees.</p><p>亚马逊的亚马逊的创始人并不希望每小时努力坚持长期以来一直盯着威胁的“大，不满”劳动力，尼克克先生召回。他说，公司数据显示，随着时间的推移，大多数员工都变得不​​那么渴望，并且贝佐斯先生认为人们本身懒惰。 “他会说的是，我们的性质是人类的是尽可能地消耗尽可能多的能量来获得我们想要的东西。”从整个业务中嵌入了这一定罪，从即时命令到普遍使用数据来充分利用员工。</p><p> So guaranteed wage increases stopped after three years, and Amazon provided incentives for low-skilled employees to leave. Every year, Mr. Palmer saw signs go up offering associates thousands of dollars to resign, and as he entered JFK8 each morning, he passed a classroom for free courses to train them in other fields.</p><p> 所以保证工资增加三年后停止，亚马逊为低技能员工提供了激励措施。每年，Palmer先生看到标志上涨了数千美元的辞职，并且在他每天早上进入JFK8时，他通过了一个课堂，以便在其他领域训练他们。</p><p> Mr. Agboka, the H.R. leader, said while the company offered training and careers at Amazon to those interested, it was proud to also provide people short-term employment for the “seasons and periods of time” they need.</p><p> “埃比克先生，”埃尔··联系人“，虽然公司向亚马逊提供培训和职业对那些感兴趣的人表示，但它很自豪地为人们提供”季节和时间“的人需要的短期就业。</p><p>  As the virus arrived at JFK8, Mr. Palmer worried about how Amazon would protect and communicate with workers. Notification about the warehouse’s first positive case had been uneven. A colleague working near Mr. Smalls had appeared sick, her eyes bloodshot as she struggled through her shift.</p><p>  由于病毒抵达JFK8，帕尔默先生担心亚马逊如何保护和沟通工人。关于仓库第一个积极案例的通知已经不均匀。一位同事在先生靠近的一家工作，似乎病了，她的眼睛血腥，因为她通过她的转变挣扎。</p><p> The two men saw only one solution: for JFK8 to pause, clean and reassess, as an Amazon facility in Queens had briefly done. Unpaid leave wasn’t enough, they said — a company run by the richest man on earth shouldn’t force workers to choose between safety and a paycheck.</p><p> 这两个人只看到一个解决方案：对于JFK8暂停，清洁和重新评估，因为Queens的亚马逊设施已经短暂完成。无偿休假是不够的，他们说 - 一家由地球上最富有的人经营的公司不应该强迫工人选择安全和薪水。</p><p>    “Are you guys actually just picking essential items?” one asked, referring to Amazon’s early-pandemic efforts to ship only necessary merchandise.</p><p>    “你们真的只是挑选必备物品吗？”一个人问，指亚马逊的早期大流行努力只发货，只能发货。</p><p>  Nearly all the workers in the group were Black, like Mr. Palmer and Mr. Smalls, or Latino. So were more than 60 percent of associates at JFK8, according to internal Amazon records from 2019. Management, the documents show, was more than 70 percent white or Asian. Black associates at JFK8 were almost 50 percent more likely to be fired — whether for productivity, misconduct, or not showing up for work — than their white peers, the records show. (Amazon said it could not confirm the data without knowing more specifics about its source.)</p><p>  几乎所有人的所有工人都是黑色的，就像帕尔默先生和小学生或拉丁美洲先生一样。根据2019年的内部亚马逊记录，据亚马逊记录有超过60％的员工伙伴员。管理层，文件展示，超过70％的白色或亚洲人。记录显示，JFK8的黑人伙伴近50％近50％，更有可能被解雇 - 无论是生产力，不当行为，还是没有出现的工作，而不是他们的白色同行。 （亚马逊表示，在不了解其来源的更多细节，无法确认数据。） </p><p> Source: Amazon&#39;s 2018 report to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission · Note: Bar heights are scaled by the total number of employees in each category. “Others” includes Native Hawaiians, Native Americans, Alaskan Natives and employees belonging to two or more groups.</p><p>资料来源：亚马逊＆＃39; 2018年向美国的汇报举报·注：栏高度由每个类别中的员工总数缩放。 “其他人”包括夏威夷本土人，美洲原住民，阿拉斯加的当地人和属于两个或更多群体的员工。</p><p> Between the constant monitoring, the assumption that many workers are slackers, and the lack of advancement opportunity, “a lot of minority workers just felt like we were being used,” Mr. Palmer said later.</p><p> 在不断的监测之间，许多工人是懒散的假设，以及缺乏进步机会，“很多少数民族工人才被使用，”帕尔默先生稍后说。</p><p> “We’re the heart and soul of that building,” he wrote in the chat. “Nothing gets done without us.”</p><p> “我们是那座建筑的心灵和灵魂，”他在聊天中写道。 “没有我们，没有什么可以完成。”</p><p> The two men continued their break-room warnings for several more days, and confronted JFK8 managers. “If, God forbid, somebody in this building passes away, or somebody’s loved one passes away, that’s going to be on your hands, not mine,” Mr. Smalls, the firecracker of the pair, told the warehouse’s top leader, according to an audio recording of one conversation.</p><p> 这两个人继续他们的休息室警告几天，并面对JFK8经理。 “如果上帝禁止，这座建筑物中的某人越来越多，或者某人被爱的人远离，那将在你的手上，而不是我的，”这对阵的爆竹先生，令人谨慎的是，这对雷克斯的最高领导者告诉仓库的最高领导者一个对话的音频录制。</p><p> On March 30, they demonstrated in the parking lot with a small group of other employees. Mr. Palmer carried a sign that read, “Treat your workers like your customers.”</p><p> 3月30日，他们在停车场展示了一小群其他员工。帕尔默先生携带了一个读书的标志，“像你的客户一样对待你的工人。”</p><p> In Seattle, executives still grappling with cratering attendance sought to minimize the protest but instead drew more  attention to it. Amazon fired Mr. Smalls, saying his demonstration had violated a quarantine order based on his contact with the sick co-worker.
