", "note_en": "Patrick Doherty had always been very active. He trekked the Himalayas and hiked trails in Spain.\n  But about a year and a half ago, he noticed pins and needles in his fingers and toes. His feet got cold. And then he started getting out of breath any time he walked his dog up the hills of County Donegal in Ireland where he lives.\n  &#34;I noticed on some of the larger hill climbs I was getting a bit breathless,&#34; says Doherty, 65. &#34;So I realized something was wrong.&#34;\n  Doherty found out he had a rare, but devastating inherited disease \u2014 known as  transthyretin amyloidosis \u2014 that had killed his father. A misshapen protein was building up in his body, destroying important tissues, such as nerves in his hands and feet and his heart.\n    &#34;It&#39;s terrible prognosis,&#34; Doherty says. &#34;This is a condition that deteriorates very rapidly. It&#39;s just dreadful.&#34;\n  So Doherty was thrilled when he found out that doctors were testing a new way to try to treat amyloidosis. The approach used a revolutionary gene-editing technique called  CRISPR, which allows scientists to make very precise changes in DNA.\n      On Saturday, researchers reported the first data indicating that the experimental treatment worked, causing levels of the destructive protein to plummet in Doherty&#39;s body and the bodies of five other patients treated with the approach.\n    The advance is being hailed not just for amyloidosis patients but also as a proof-of-concept that CRISPR could be used to treat many other, much more common diseases. It&#39;s a new way of using the innovative technology.\n  &#34;This is a major milestone for patients,&#34; says  Jennifer Doudna of the University of California, Berkeley, who shared a Nobel Prize for her work helping develop CRISPR.\n  &#34;While these are early data, they show us that we can overcome one of the biggest challenges with applying CRISPR clinically so far, which is being able to deliver it systemically and get it to the right place,&#34; Doudna says.\n  CRISPR has already been shown to help patients suffering from the devastating blood disorders  sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. And doctors are trying to use it to treat cancer and to  restore vision to people blinded by a rare genetic disorder.\n  But those experiments involve taking cells out of the body, editing them in the lab, and infusing them back in or injecting CRISPR directly into cells that need fixing.\n    The study Doherty volunteered for is the first in which doctors are simply infusing the gene-editor directly into patients and letting it find its own way to the right gene in the right cells. In this case, it&#39;s cells in the liver making the destructive protein.\n  &#34;This is the first example in which CRISPR-Cas9 is injected directly into the bloodstream \u2014 in other words systemic administration \u2014 where we use it as a way to reach a tissue that&#39;s far away from the site of injection and very specifically use it to edit disease-causing genes,&#34; says John Leonard, the CEO of  Intellia Therapeutics, which is sponsoring the study.\n  Doctors infused billions of microscopic structures known as nanoparticles carrying genetic instructions for the CRISPR gene-editor into four patients in London and two in New Zealand. The nanoparticles were absorbed by their livers, where they unleashed armies of CRISPR gene-editors. The CRISPR editor homed in on the target gene in the liver  and sliced it, disabling production of the destructive protein.\n  Within weeks, the levels of protein causing the disease plummeted, especially in the volunteers who received a higher dose. Researchers reported at the  Peripheral Nerve Society Annual Meeting and in a  paper published in  The New England Journal of Medicine.\n  &#34;It really is exciting,&#34; says Dr.  Julian Gillmore, who is leading the study at the University College London, Royal Free Hospital.\n  &#34;This has the potential to completely revolutionize the outcome for these patients who have lived with this disease in their family for many generations. It&#39;s decimated some families that I&#39;ve been looking after. So this is amazing,&#34; Gillmore says.\n  The patients will have to be followed longer, and more patients will have to be treated, to make sure the treatment&#39;s safe, and determine how much it&#39;s helping, Gillmore stresses. But the approach could help those struck by amyloidosis that isn&#39;t inherited, which is a far more common version of the disease, he says.\n  Moreover, the promising results potentially open the door for using the same approach to treatment of many other, more common diseases for which taking cells out of the body or directly injecting CRISPR isn&#39;t realistic, including heart disease, muscular dystrophy and brain diseases such as Alzheimer&#39;s.\n  &#34;This is really opening a new era as we think about gene-editing where we can begin to think about accessing all kinds of different tissue in the body via systemic administration,&#34; Leonard says.\n    &#34;This is a wonderful day for the future of gene-editing as a medicine,&#34;  agree  Fyodor Urnov, a professor of genetics at the University of California, Berkeley. &#34;We as a species are watching this remarkable new show called: our gene-edited future.&#34;\n  Doherty says he started feeling better within weeks of the treatment and has continued to improve in the weeks since then.\n  &#34;I definitely feel better,&#34; he told NPR. &#34;I&#39;m speaking to you from upstairs in our house. I climbed stairs to get up here. I would have been feeling breathless. I&#39;m thrilled.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:27:25", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u57fa\u56e0,gene,crispr", "title":

", "note_en": "Adventures with Van Gogh is a weekly blog by Martin Bailey, our long-standing correspondent and expert on the artist. Published every Friday, his stories will range from newsy items about this most intriguing artist to scholarly pieces based on his own meticulous investigations and discoveries.\n  Reproduced here for the first time: a trio of sketches from Vincent\u2019s village\u2014designed as a bookmark\n One of Van Gogh\u2019s most unusual artworks has just emerged\u2014three unknown sketches of peasants. They are drawn on a thin vertical strip of paper, a curious format for an artist to choose. The drawings were found in a novel on the French peasantry and the paper is exactly the same height as the book.\n The three sketches are reproduced by  The Art Newspaper here for the first time. Discoveries of totally unknown Van Gogh drawings are now rare\u2014perhaps once or twice in a decade. The sheet has just gone on display at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, in a new exhibition on acquisitions,   Here to Stay (until 12 September). Although it is presented in the show as simply a trio of sketches, the artwork almost certainly served an unexpected purpose.\n    Teio Meedendorp, a senior researcher at the Amsterdam museum, told us: \u201cI believe that it was made as a bookmark. It would be curious to draw three sketches in this configuration unless there was a reason, and it fits snugly inside the book in which it was found.\u201d\n    Vincent, an avid reader, gave his copy of a novel on the French peasantry to his Dutch artist friend Anthon van Rappard. Writing to Van Rappard on 15 June 1883, he said he would be posting a package to him in Utrecht, with prints and a book by the French writers Emile Erckmann and Alexandre Chatrian, whom he greatly admired.  Histoire d\u2019un Paysan recounts the story of the French Revolution through the eyes of an Alsace peasant. Illustrated by Th\u00e9ophile Schuler, Vincent assured his friend that \u201cI do think you\u2019ll find the Erckmann-Chatrian beautiful\u201d.\n    Van Rappard died in 1892, aged just 33, and the book then passed to his wife Henri\u00ebtte, who lived until 1910.  Histoire d\u2019un Paysan, together with the bookmark, was quietly preserved by her family until 2019, when both were privately sold to the Van Gogh Museum.\n The pencil drawings are crude, since they were done soon after Vincent set out to become an artist, but they are important since so few of his early informal sketches survive. Stylistically, they can be dated to autumn 1881, when he was living in his parent\u2019s village of Etten and was deeply interested in capturing figures of the local peasants at work.\n It was not until two years later that Vincent sent  Histoire d\u2019un Paysan to Van Rappard, suggesting that the bookmark had lain forgotten in the novel and was not noticed when he wrapped up the package. If Vincent had set out to give Van Rappard a few sketches, he would have been much more likely to have sent very recent ones, to demonstrate how his art was developing.\n On the 28cm-high bookmark, the upper sketch shows a woman walking by a pollarded tree. The middle one portrays a seated man beside a fire, a work reminiscent of a finished drawing which Van Gogh made in November 1881,   Old Man at the Fireside  (now Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum, Otterlo). The lower sketch depicts a woman in profile. Van Gogh may well have seen the figures as loosely illustrating the Erckmann-Chatrian novel.\n    The front of the book is signed \u201cVincent\u201d. He had sent the book to Van Rappard \u201cto read\u201d and it is unclear whether the signature indicates that it was a gift or was a polite reminder that it was a loan and should be returned.\n    In October, just over year after sending the book, Van Rappard visited Vincent in Nuenen\u2014but without returning the book. During the visit Van Gogh sketched a portrait of his friend, the largest drawn portrait in his entire oeuvre. Only the top half of the work survives.\n Sadly, their friendship came to an abrupt end in May 1885, after Van Rappard wrote critically about Vincent\u2019s only  lithograph, which depicted his painting of  The Potato Eaters. Vincent, who was furious, dismembered the portrait, neatly slicing it in half. The bottom half has been lost, but he soon reused the reverse of the top half to make rough sketches of a pair of women and a man carrying a bundle of wood.\n Thanks to this recycling, the most important half of the Van Rappard portrait, with the eyes, has been saved\u2014poignant evidence of Van Gogh\u2019s closest friendship during his Dutch artistic years.\n  \u2022 Christie\u2019s is to sell a drawing of   The Potato Harvester (Aardappelrooier)  in London on 30 June, estimated at \u00a3300,000-\u00a3500,000. Dating from June-July 1885, it was done in Nuenen, the village in the south of the Netherlands. Fork in hand, the peasant is digging up potatoes, while smoking his pipe.  The Potato Harvester was originally owned by the distinguished Dutch art historian H.P. Bremmer.\n    \u2022 The  Sunflowers (August 1888) is back in London this week, after being the star attraction for a tour of the National Gallery\u2019s paintings to Japan and Australia. At the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra the exhibition of 61 works was seen by 201,000 people during its 15-week run. With Covid-19, this is likely to rank among the world\u2019s best-attended 2020-21 exhibitions.\n    Martin Bailey is a leading Van Gogh specialist and investigative reporter for  The Art Newspaper. Bailey has curated Van Gogh exhibitions at the Barbican Art Gallery and Compton Verney/National Gallery of Scotland. He was a co-curator of Tate Britain\u2019s  The EY Exhibition: Van Gogh and Britain (27 March-11 August 2019). He has written a number of bestselling books, including  The Sunflowers Are Mine: The Story of Van Gogh&#39;s Masterpiece (Frances Lincoln 2013, available in the  UK and  US),  Studio of the South: Van Gogh in Provence (Frances Lincoln 2016, available in the  UK and  US) and  Starry Night: Van Gogh at the Asylum (White Lion Publishing 2018, available in the  UK and  US). Bailey&#39;s  Living with Vincent van Gogh: The Homes &amp; Landscapes that Shaped the Artist (White Lion Publishing 2019, available in the  UK and  US) provides an overview of the artist\u2019s life.

", "note_en": "Those of us who learned arithmetic using pen and paper, working with the ten digits 0\u20139 and place value, may take for granted that this is the way it\u2019s always been done, or at least the way it ought to be done. But if you think of the amount of time and energy spent in the early school years just to teach place value, you\u2019ll realize that this sort of numeracy is not preordained.\n  Over the past 5,500 years, more than 100 distinct ways of writing numbers have been developed and used by numerate societies, linguistic anthropologist Stephen Chrisomalis has found. Thousands more ways of speaking numbers, manipulating physical objects, and using human bodies to enumerate are known to exist, or to have existed, he writes in his new book \u201c Reckonings: Numerals, Cognition, and History.\u201d Remarkably, each of the basic structures was invented multiple times independently of one another. In \u201cReckonings,\u201d Chrisomalis considers how humans past and present have used numerals, reinterpreting historical and archaeological representations of numerical notation and exploring the implications of why we write numbers with figures rather than words. Drawing on, and expanding upon, the enormous cross-cultural and comparative literatures in linguistics, cognitive anthropology, and the history of science that bear on questions of numeracy, he shows that numeracy is a social practice.\n Chrisomalis took time out from a busy end to the spring semester to field a few questions about his new book, his spirited defense of Roman numerals, his complicated relationships with mathematicians, and his thoughts on the validity of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis.\n  Philip Laughlin: We\u2019ve worked with a number of linguists and anthropologists over the years but you are our first author to specialize in written numerical systems. What sparked your interest in this topic? Why are numerals an important area of research?\n Stephen Chrisomalis: I first became interested in numerals when I wrote a paper in an undergraduate cognitive anthropology course in the mid-1990s. After moving away from the subject for a couple years, I came back to it when I was looking for a PhD topic along with my advisor, the late Bruce Trigger at McGill. This resulted in my dissertation, which later became my first book, \u201c Numerical Notation: A Comparative History\u201d (Cambridge, 2010). It was an unorthodox project for an anthropology department \u2014 neither strictly archaeological nor ethnohistorical nor ethnographic. But that was exactly the sort of creative project that it was possible to do at McGill at that time, and that sadly, given the exigencies of the modern job market, is almost impossible to imagine doing today.\n  What brought me to numerical notation as a dissertation subject is much of what still appeals to me about it now. We have evidence from over 100 different systems used across every inhabited continent over 5,000 years, including all the world\u2019s literate traditions. Numbers are a ubiquitous domain of human existence, and written numerals are virtually everywhere that there is writing. While, of course, the historical and archaeological records are partial (which is in turn both exciting and frustrating), understanding their history and cross-cultural transmission is a tractable problem. We can tell, roughly, when and where they originate and how they relate to one another.\n Also, every user of a numerical notation system is also a speaker of one or more languages, which lets us ask great questions comparing number words to numerical notation and to show how they interact. These questions can be as simple as \u201cDo people say \u2018two thousand twenty one\u2019 or \u2018twenty twenty one\u2019?\u201d and as big as \u201cWere numbers first visual marks or spoken words?\u201d As a linguist and an anthropologist, that\u2019s very attractive. Because there is a significant and large literature on numerical cognition, the comparative, historical data I bring to the table is useful for testing and expanding on our knowledge in that interdisciplinary area.\n PL: You had the cover image and title for this book in your head for years. Can you explain the significance of the watch and why you chose the title \u201cReckonings\u201d in the first place? What were you trying to get across to potential readers with that evocative word?\n  SC: The title \u2018Reckonings\u2019 invokes the triple meaning of the word \u2018reckon\u2019 \u2014 to calculate, to think, and to judge \u2014 which parallels the three parts of the subtitle: \u201cNumerals, Cognition, and History.\u201d Reckoning is not mathematics, in its technical, disciplinary sense, but it reflects the everyday practices of working with and manipulating numbers. Then, in English and in other languages, we extend the verb for calculation to thinking in general \u2014 to reckon thus involves the more general cognitive questions I hope I\u2019ve addressed. Finally, we come to reckoning as judgement \u2014 every numerical notation faces its own reckoning as users decide whether to adopt, transmit, and eventually, abandon it. As I spend a lot of time talking about the obsolescence of numeral systems, most notably but not limited to the Roman numerals, I wanted to echo this decision-making process of judgement by which users decide to abandon one notation in favor of another. \u201cReckonings\u201d signals that the book might be about arithmetic \u2014 but it\u2019s about a lot more than that.\n  The cover image of the book is a watch designed by the French watchmaker Jean-Antoine L\u00e9pine in 1788, now held at the British Museum (BM 1958,1201.289). L\u00e9pine was one of the first horologists to consistently use Western (commonly called Arabic) numerals instead of Roman numerals for hour markers, but in the 1780s he made a number of watches like this one, where he instead playfully mixed the two systems. The hybridity on this sort of artifact is visually striking and memorable to the viewer, both then and now. But actually, it isn\u2019t as weird as it seems; we combine numerical representations all the time, like when we write something like \u201c1.2 million\u201d instead of \u201c1,200,000.\u201d Unlike the Roman numerals alone, which would be visually \u2018unbalanced\u2019 on a watch, this hybrid system expresses every number from 1 through 12 in no more than two digits. To me it embodies the passage of time in material form and the replacement of the Roman numerals. By the 1780s, they had been replaced for most purposes, but watch and clock faces are one of the places where, even today, they\u2019re pretty common. As a sort of metonym for this historical process, the L\u00e9pine watch highlights that the decline and fall of the Roman numerals was not a slow, steady, predictable replacement, but one with many disjunctures.\n PL: At the book launch, you talked a bit about the future of number systems, but with the caveat that you are not a \u201cFuturologist.\u201d So I\u2019ll ask you to put on a historian\u2019s hat instead: What kind of cultural changes are necessary for a society to switch from one number system to another? It seems to me that significant changes would have to happen at least at the political and economic level for one numerical system to supersede another, right?\n SC: One of the key arguments in \u201cReckonings\u201d is that numerical notations don\u2019t get replaced in orderly, \u2018survival of the fittest\u2019 processes. To argue that simply raises the question: fittest for what purpose? Numerical notations are principally used for representation and communication, not computation, so it\u2019s the context of writing and reading practices, rather than changes in mathematics, that motivate their history. The last time that happened was with the advent of the printing press and the rise of a more general literacy among white middle-class Europeans in the 15 th and 16 th centuries alongside mercantile capitalism \u2014 and not coincidentally, that was exactly when, where, and by whom the Roman numerals were substantially abandoned. Strikingly, this was not accompanied with a lot of fanfare or explicit comparison of the two systems. The Western numerals had been around in Europe for 500 years, and then, once conditions were right, they rapidly supplanted Roman numerals so that some commentators could even see the change within a lifetime.\n  Just in general, though, we should be very hesitant to assume that we are at the \u2018end of history\u2019 of anything, whether that\u2019s a number system or a political system. Nothing lasts forever \u2013 we may simply lack the imagination to think of how and when it could be replaced. I\u2019m confident that your average Roman or Egyptian or Aztec merchant or engineer couldn\u2019t have imagined the Western numerals. In the same way, I think we\u2019re subject to the same sort of cognitive closure \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine from our vantage point what could ever change to lead to the abandonment of a universal notation. While I don\u2019t see it happening soon, the sorts of massive technological changes of the past 50 years, extended for another century or two, could be such a catalyst. But alone, technology isn\u2019t deterministic \u2014 only in conjunction with changes in social, economic, and communicative practices would that be likely. And even then, there\u2019s no guarantee. Not only would such a system need to be invented, but some community of users would need to perceive it as being sufficiently better, for some purpose, to warrant abandoning what is, at this point, a universal notation. One of the costs of doing so is that, because numerical systems are for communicating, using a rare system means you aren\u2019t able to communicate with as many people as with a common one. That isn\u2019t necessarily fatal to a notation\u2019s survival, but it is an obstacle to be overcome.\n PL: I\u2019m curious to know how mathematicians have responded to your work. How do they feel about the historical perspective you bring to number systems and arithmetic, and does it have any bearing on their own work?\n SC: Well, I sometimes joke with my friends and collaborators who are mathematicians that mathematics is the branch of anthropology that focuses on numbers! Seriously, though, mathematics and anthropology seem to stand on the opposite ends of a spectrum about the degree to which the phenomena they study are fundamentally human. Mathematicians are mostly Platonists \u2014 or really, more strictly, mathematical realists \u2014 they argue very persuasively that abstract mathematical objects like numbers are in some sense real independent of our observation of them. Some of this sense is intuitive \u2014 anyone who has done mathematics has experienced this sensation of real discovery, even when \u2018discovering\u2019 something that had been known for centuries. But some of it is based on the quite proper insight that even very weird mathematical entities, like \u03c0, are not subject to cultural whim. In contrast, anthropologists tend to see most things as culturally constructed and subject to variation \u2014 a human product of specific social contexts. These are caricatures, but there\u2019s some truth to them. Anthropologists tend not to spend a lot of time on things where the human element is irrelevant.\n In the late 1940s and early 1950s this led to a debate between the Platonist mathematician and popularizer Martin Gardner and the materialist evolutionary anthropologist Leslie White. The former treats variation in the form of notation as nothing more than differences in representing a deep, underlying reality, the latter sees the construction of mathematical objects by human minds as prior to the invention of formal mathematics. And because anthropologists (as a stereotype with some validity) don\u2019t often have much training in mathematics, it\u2019s easy to fall into this binary. But actually it doesn\u2019t need to be nearly so antagonistic. Most mathematicians freely grant that humans create notations, and that different notations make some ideas easy to see and others much harder. And even a brief look at the comparative history of mathematics and numeration shows that there is much more commonality among human arithmetic than there is difference. There simply is nowhere where 1+1=3. That\u2019s because the human mind is interacting with the real world to produce insights, and that\u2019s true even for mathematics where the objects of analysis are quite abstract.\n PL: You spend a lot of time debunking the idea that the Roman numerals are an inferior notation. Why so much energy on defending an archaic system? What do the Roman numerals tell us about number systems in general?\n SC: Of all the number systems still in use today, the only one most readers will be familiar that uses a different structure to the now nearly-universal Western numerals 0-9 are the Roman numerals. They may be archaic but we still use them for all sorts of secondary and prestige functions, like counting things we really value, such as kings, popes, and Super Bowls. (Although every year, the week before the Super Bowl, there is a news article complaining about them!) But they are still taught and learned in lots of schools. And actually, that\u2019s part of the problem, because along with the signs IVXLCDM and the rules for combining them, we are also taught an ideology that the Roman numerals were no good for math, and that was why they were discarded. That ideology is so pervasive that it has rarely been questioned.\n  It\u2019s not that I think the Roman numerals are the best system available; they just aren\u2019t nearly as awful as we\u2019ve been conditioned to believe. They not only survived but thrived, throughout large swaths of Europe, for 2,000 years. Unless we believe that pre-modern people were a bunch of dupes, they can\u2019t have been so bad. Even after the Western numerals 0-9 were introduced into Europe through Arabic and Indian ancestors, it took hundreds of years for the Roman numerals to be supplanted. This is not some sort of archaism that just happened to avoid being snuffed out. It was a core representational practice throughout most of Europe for almost any purpose you can imagine numbers being used for. The one thing they weren\u2019t really used for is what we now think of as pen-and-paper arithmetic \u2014 lining up numbers in columns. That\u2019s because in classical antiquity and indeed, until the past few hundred years, arithmetic was an embodied and material practice (e.g., on a counting board or abacus) whereas numerical notation was used for writing and recording. This division of labor is very common throughout the world\u2019s numerical notations, most of which were never manipulated directly for arithmetic.\n PL: Since you are an anthropology professor and I am a cognitive science editor at The MIT Press, I would be remiss if I did not ask you about Benjamin Lee Whorf\u2019s \u201c Language, Thought, and Reality.\u201d This is probably the first cognitive science book MIT Press ever published and it has remained in print for over 60 years now. In 2021, what do you make of that book in particular and the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis in general? Is it an idea that still retains power?\n SC:  \u201cLanguage, Thought, and Reality\u201d is almost certainly the most cited piece of linguistic anthropological writing ever, and still taught in hundreds of courses, including my own graduate seminar, where I regularly teach the chapter \u201cThe relation of habitual thought and behavior to language.\u201d It is also one of the most deeply misunderstood books across multiple fields. There really is no such thing as \u201cthe Sapir-Whorf hypothesis\u201d; rather, there are a set of ideas, some centuries old, about the effect that language has on thought. But everyone knows that language has some effect on thought \u2014 no reasonable person denies this. What Whorf, Sapir, and other linguistic relativists do is argue that variations in linguistic structure \u2014 patterns in syntax or morphology, or differences in how languages divide up the world \u2014 affect cognition. (Although I should note that neither Sapir nor Whorf used the term \u2018cognition\u2019 at all, because MIT Press was one of the first presses to define cognitive science as an independent subject of investigation!) What is the scope of these effects? Probably less than in some of the more programmatic statements by folks like Whorf, but significantly more than would have been assumed by linguists, say, 30 years ago when I first studied the discipline.\n Number and numeracy was one of the earliest domains of human social life studied under what we would now think of as the 19th-century ancestors of linguistic relativity \u2014 but largely in a now-rightly rejected way that saw systems of thought as part of ordered, evolutionary stages from simple to complex. I recently published  a paper on this very subject. In  LT&amp;R, Whorf argued that Newtonian physics was, in significant part, a product of the structuring influence of European languages in which Newton wrote, like Latin and English. That\u2019s a big claim and hard to justify empirically. But both number words and number notations are basically categories; they\u2019re ways of dividing up the world of quantity meaningfully, and humans do it in different ways. These notations constrain but do not determine how we solve numerical problems. A meme that floats around social media every few months asks people to describe how they solve the problem \u201c28 + 47.\u201d The answer is 75 \u2014 that\u2019s not relativistic. And there are a number of strategies for solving the problem. In a community where arithmetic is mediated through a device like an abacus, the strategies will be even more varied.

", "note_en": "On Thursday, July 13, 1995, a concentration of high pressure in the upper atmosphere above Midwest Chicago forced massive amounts of hot air to the ground, causing temperatures as high as 41\u00b0C (106\u00b0F). In a Midwestern city not built for tropical heat, roads buckled, cars broke down in the street, and schools closed their doors. On Friday, three Con Ed power transformers failed, leaving 49,000 people without electricity. In high-rise apartments with no air conditioning, temperatures hit 49\u00b0C (120\u00b0F) even with the windows open. The heat continued into Saturday. The human body can only take about 48 hours of uninterrupted heat like this before its defenses begin to shut down, and emergency rooms were so crowded they had to turn away heatstroke victims. Sunday was no better, and as the death toll rose\u2014of dehydration, heat exhaustion, and renal failure\u2014the morgues hit capacity, too, and bodies were stored in refrigerated meat-packing trucks. In all, 739 people died as a result of the heat wave.\n In its aftermath, an inquiry found, unsurprisingly, that the majority of those who died were poor, old, and lived alone. More surprising was the gender imbalance: significantly more men died than women. This was especially strange considering that in Chicago in July\u00a0of 1995, there were more old women who lived alone than old men.\n What made these men more vulnerable than the women? It wasn\u2019t physical circumstances. Both groups lived mostly in \u201csingle room occupancy\u201d buildings, or   SROs\u2014apartments of one room in what used to be called flophouses. It was social circumstances. The phrase \u201cNo known relatives\u201d appears repeatedly in police reports of the dead men\u2019s homes. Letters of regret were found on floors and in backs of drawers: \u201cI would like to see you if that\u2019s possible, when you come to the city\u201d; \u201cIt seems to me that our family should have gotten along.\u201d The single rooms of the deceased are described as \u201croach infested\u201d and \u201ca complete mess,\u201d indicating few or no visitors. The women, according to Eric Klinenberg,  who wrote a book on the heat wave, had people who checked up on them and so kept them alive; the men did not. \u201cWhen you have time please come visit me soon at my place,\u201d read another letter, unsent.\n   Artie, 63, who lives in Beards Fork, West Virginia, population 200, has never married. He grew up in Beards Fork, but spent most of his life elsewhere. He moved back when he was 47 to take care of his sick mother, who died earlier this year. Now, after putting his own life on hold for sixteen years, he finds himself single, semi-retired, and without a close friend. \u201cLife goes by really fast,\u201d he said. Since his mom died, he\u2019s found himself thinking, \u201cWhere in the hell did it go?\u201d\n This is the kind of thing he used to talk about with his mother. Now that she\u2019s gone, he doesn\u2019t really open up to anyone. He has no close friends in the area, and he\u2019s \u201cfelt a lot of depression over the past few years.\u201d\n Artie\u2019s not an antisocial guy or a homebody. His career brought him into contact with hundreds of interesting people over the years; he lived in California for a decade, and before that he had a nine-year relationship. But back in his hometown, all the connections he made seem to have melted away. \u201cI don\u2019t really have any close friends, other than my family,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is something different.\u201d (A 2005 Australian  study agreed: while close friendships increase your longevity by up to 22\u00a0percent, family relationships make no difference.)\n Artie has a group of friends he met in his thirties and forties with whom he\u2019s still in touch, mainly on Facebook, but those relationships are \u201cnot quite the same as the friendships I had when I was younger. Less deep. Less vulnerable. And I\u2019m not even sure I want to [open up].\u201d He\u2019s somewhat close with a few of his former coworkers, but though they confide in him, he doesn\u2019t feel like he can confide in them. \u201cThey\u2019re younger,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand my problems.\u201d Despite being semi-retired, he still goes into the office every day and stays late, after everyone\u2019s gone. \u201cI\u2019m reluctant to go home,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody\u2019s there.\u201d\n In many ways, Artie seems in danger of going down the path of those Chicago   SRO-dwellers. But there\u2019s an important difference between those men and Artie: what the former had in common was their  social isolation\u2014having few or no social connections. Artie\u2019s problem, on the other hand, is one of  loneliness\u2014the  feeling of being isolated, regardless of your social connectedness, usually due to having few or no confidants.\n  At first glance it seems unlikely. I\u2019m 34. I have what seems to me a pretty active social life. I\u2019m integrated into my community and I go to arts events regularly. I\u2019ve lived here in Toronto off and on since I was 18. I went to university here. I helped found an arts venue here. I know hundreds of people here, if not thousands. I have multiple jobs\u2014college instructor, freelance writer, tutor. I have friends. Whatever path led to these lonely destinations, I want to believe, is not the path I\u2019m on. When I die, my floor will be tidy, and my letters sent.\n And yet, there\u2019s something about their stories that seems eerily familiar. Slowly but surely, I feel my social world slipping away from me. All three of my jobs combined require me to be around other humans a total of about eight hours out of a week\u2019s 168. The other 160, I\u2019m mostly at home. It\u2019s not unusual for me to go several days in a row with no social contact of any kind, and the longer I go without it, the scarier it feels. I become shy, paranoid that no one would want to hang out with me. Social slights metastasize in my brain. I start to avoid social functions, convinced I\u2019ll walk into a wall of mysterious eye contact. I live close to many friends, but I hide from them when I see them in the street. I don\u2019t think of myself as antisocial\u2014I love people, love being around them, and have had so many good friendships\u2014but it often feels like an uphill battle, and mystifyingly complex, to not slip back endlessly into this pit of despair.\n The thing is, I wasn\u2019t always like this. How did I get here?\n  Friendship in adulthood is a challenge for a lot of people. On average,  both m en and women start to lose friends around age 25, and  continue to lose friends steadily for the rest of our lives. As adults, we tend to work more, commit to more serious romantic relationships, and start families, all of which end up taking priority over buddy time. Even if, like me, at age 34, you don\u2019t have full-time work, you\u2019re not in a relationship, and you\u2019re nowhere close to starting your own family, others\u2019 adulting leaves you bereft.\n Furthermore, young adults  move around the country more than any other demographic, which severs our support networks\u2014a phenomenon Robert Putnam calls the \u201cre-potting\u201d effect, referring to the injury a transplanted plant sustains losing its roots.  People are changing jobs more than ever, which interrupts connections that in previous eras would have become decades long. And freelancing, which  Forbes estimates  50\u00a0percent\u00a0of the   U.S. workforce will be doing in one way or another by 2020, deprives the worker of not only job security, but social stability. As a freelancer who\u2019s had six different jobs in the past year alone and who lived in a dozen countries throughout my twenties, I fall squarely into the most vulnerable part of this Venn diagram. I try to compensate by keeping up with, like, four or five different friend-groups on social media\u2014mostly Facebook, where I have 3,691 contacts\u2014but I often find myself using social media more like a performance art video game than a way to facilitate friendships. And studies show that I\u2019m closer to the norm than the exception. \u201cOnline social contacts with friends and family,\u201d as  one study put it, \u201cwere not an effective alternative for offline social interactions in reducing feelings of loneliness.\u201d\n And that\u2019s what I am, I guess. Lonely. Sometimes excruciatingly so. Loneliness can be measured by psychometry like the    UCLA Loneliness Scale (I scored 21 out of 40) or the  De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (I am high on emotional loneliness, low on social loneliness). For me, though, loneliness at its core is a stubborn, irrational certainty that no matter how well I know the people in my life\u2014several of whom I consider close, some of whom I\u2019ve known for decades\u2014I am not, as the poem goes, involved in mankind. I still feel, in the bad moments, frantic with isolation, and become my 16-year-old self, desperate on the edge of my parents\u2019 bathtub, mentally searching for a friend, having ruled out all the obvious candidates. I tried to summon a world in which Blake MacPhail, whose sister\u2019s apartment I visited once two years earlier, could be considered my friend. That wasn\u2019t the loneliest I ever felt, but it set the template, and I still feel that way more often than perhaps those who know me would suspect. Or maybe they would suspect it; maybe they feel it too; over the past few decades, as the structure of society has changed, loneliness has increased, and now affects  almost half the population. Just last week, the American Psychological Association issued a  press release advising that \u201cmany nations around the world now suggest we are facing a \u2018loneliness epidemic.\u2019\u201d\n And as if  feeling lonely wasn\u2019t bad enough, it also turns out that loneliness and isolation are shockingly bad for your health and wellbeing. The quality of your friendships is the largest predictor of your  happiness. Social isolation weakens your immune system, raises your blood pressure, messes with your sleep, and  can be as bad for you as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. According to the authors of  a widely cited meta-analysis, loneliness on its own can increase your chances of an early death by 30\u00a0percent\u00a0and \u201cheightened risk for mortality from a lack of social relationships is greater than that from obesity.\u201d And in practical terms, being in contact with nobody in an emergency, like the men in the Chicago heat wave, can kill you in an instant.\n Unfortunately for me, like the majority of those Chicago dead, I belong to another, perhaps counterintuitive, at-risk category: I\u2019m a man. All that freelancing and moving and adulthood stuff affects men and women alike, but, for a complex set of reasons, men face additional roadblocks to connection. On average, we have  fewer confidants\u00a0and\u00a0are  more socially isolated.\u00a0Women  do report being lonelier than men, and research says, statistically, they are\u2014if they\u2019re married and between the ages of 20 and 49. For all other demographics, though,\u00a0 men are in fact lonelier than women. On top of all that, there\u2019s a   consensus among  researchers   that due to male reluctance to self-identify as having emotional problems, the ubiquity of men\u2019s loneliness is probably being underestimated.\n  I have a photograph of my friend Tyler and myself\u00a0snuggling on my parents\u2019 cream carpet, in the sun, next to my sandy dog. It\u2019s a sweet moment, but captures something bitter, too: this was probably the last time I touched a male friend in a way that wasn\u2019t a handshake or a bro-y hug. We were, like, six.\n One avenue into understanding men\u2019s loneliness is to consider how children are socialized. In an interview, Niobe Way, a professor of developmental psychology at New York University who has been doing research with adolescent boys for almost three decades, talked about how we are failing boys. \u201cThe social and emotional skills necessary for boys to thrive are just not being fostered,\u201d she said in an interview. Indeed, when you look at the research, men do not start life as the stereotypes we become. Six-month-old boys  are likely to \u201ccry more than girls,\u201d more likely to express joy at the sight of our mother\u2019s faces, and more likely to match our expressions to theirs. In general, before the age of four or five, research shows that  boys are more emotive than girls.\n The change begins around the time we start school: at that age\u2014about five\u2014boys become  worse than girls at \u201cchanging our facial expressions to foster social relationships.\u201d This is the beginning of a socialization process in \u201ca culture that supports emotional development for girls and discourages it for boys,\u201d according to  Dan Kindlon and Michael Thompson. This begins to affect our friendships early\u2014in a study in New Haven, Connecticut, boys aged 10-18 were  significantly worse than girls at knowing who their friends  were : \u201cover a two-week period, the boys changed their nomination of who their best friend was more frequently than girls, and their nomination was less likely to be reciprocated.\u201d\n Still, there\u2019ll never be better soil than school in which to grow friendships, and most boys do find good friends as children. Way, who summarized her findings in her book  Deep Secrets, found that, up until early adolescence, boys are not shy about how much they love their friends. Way quotes one boy named Justin in his first year of high school: \u201c[My best friend and I] love each other\u2026 That\u2019s it\u2026 you have this thing that is deep, so deep, it\u2019s within you, you can\u2019t explain it. \u2026 I guess in life, sometimes two people can really, really understand each other and really have a trust, respect, and love for each other.\u201d Another high school freshman, Jason, told Way friendships were important because then \u201cyou are not lonely \u2026 you need someone to turn to when things are bad.\u201d\n However, for many boys\u2014Way calls it \u201cnear-universal\u201d\u2014a shift occurs in late adolescence,\u00a0roughly from the ages of 15-20. In a phase of life we often think of in optimistic terms\u2014self-discovery, coming of age\u2014boys\u2019 trust in each other shatters like glass. Three years after his first interview, Jason, asked if he had any close friends, said no, \u201cand immediately adds that while he has nothing against gay people, he himself is not gay.\u201d Another boy interviewed by Way in the eleventh grade who up until the year before had maintained a best friendship for ten years said he now had no friends because \u201cyou can\u2019t trust nobody these days.\u201d In interviews with thousands of boys, Way saw a tight correlation between confiding in close friends and mental health, and she observed that, across all ethnic groups and income brackets, three quarters of the boys she spoke to \u201cgrow fearful of betrayal by and distrustful of their male peers\u201d in late adolescence, and \u201cbegin to speak increasingly of feeling lonely and depressed.\u201d\n Making matters worse, in the middle of this estrangement from other boys, as we\u2019re becoming young men, we\u2019re governed more than ever by a new set of rules about what behaviour we\u2019re allowed to show. Psychologists call them display rules. \u201cExpressions of hurt and worry and of care and concern for others,\u201d  according to white high schools boys, are \u201cgay\u201d or \u201cgirly.\u201d Black and Hispanic boys, according to Way\u2019s interviews, feel pressure to conform to even stricter rules. Men who break the rules, and express \u201csadness, depression, fear, and dysphoric self-conscious emotions such as shame and embarrassment\u201d are viewed as \u201c unmanly\u201d and are  comforted less than women. Way told me when she speaks in public, she often quotes a 16-year-old boy who said, \u201cIt might be nice to be a girl, \u2018cause then I wouldn\u2019t have to be emotionless.\u201d\n  And yet, it\u2019s easy to be skeptical\u2014aren\u2019t men doing fine, compared to everyone else? How much does this actually hurt men? They still have friends, don\u2019t they? And yes, entering adulthood, and up to the age of 25, men and women do have  approximately the same number of friends. For the outsider looking in, then, and even for the man himself, it may appear that nothing\u2019s amiss. But to paraphrase University of Missouri researchers Barbara Bank and Suzanne Hansford, men have power, but are not well. In the   UK,  suicide rates among men are steadily rising. In the   US, so is\u00a0 unemployment among men, often coupled with opioid abuse. In a  2006 paper addressed to psychiatric practitioners, William S. Pollack of Harvard Medical School wrote, \u201cpresent socialization systems are dangerous to boys\u2019 physical and mental health and to those around them, leading to increased school failure, depression, suicide, lonely isolation, and, in extremis, violence.\u201d In a study Pollack did of boys age 12-18, only 15\u00a0percent\u00a0of them projected \u201cpositive, forward-looking sentiment regarding their futures as men.\u201d\n Women  keep being intimate with their friends into adulthood, and men, generally,  do not: \u201cDespite efforts to dismiss it, the finding that men\u2019s same-sex friendships are less intimate and supportive than women\u2019s is robust and widely documented.\u201d\n Perhaps you want to say that men just like it that way. Perhaps you want to say, like Geoffrey Grief, writing in  Buddy System: Understanding Male Friendships,\u00a0\u201cMen are more comfortable with shoulder-to-shoulder friendships while women prefer face-to-face friendships, which are more emotionally expressive.\u201d Shoulder-to-shoulder meaning: engaging in a shared activity, like playing a game of pick-up basketball, as opposed to confiding face-to-face and being emotionally vulnerable. This may be true for some men, who, like some women, need less intimacy than others. But when asked, men say we  wish we had more intimacy in our friendships with other men.\n \u201cWhat is wrong with men,\u201d Bank and Hansford asked, \u201cthat they can\u2019t or won\u2019t do what they enjoy to the same extent as women do?\u201d In a study of 565 undergraduates, they investigated. Six possible reasons why men shut each other out were measured by questions like \u201chow often [the subject] and their best friend showed affection for each other, had a strong influence on the other, confided in the other, and depended on the other for help.\u201d The worst offenders? Homophobia, and something they called \u201cemotional restraint,\u201d which they measured by responses to statements like \u201cA man should never reveal worries to others.\u201d\n From the vantage point of adulthood, especially in progressive circles, it\u2019s easy to forget the ubiquitous and often quasi-ironic homophobia of teen boys, which circulated among my guy friends. That\u2019s why it was amazing to read  Dude, You\u2019re a Fag by   C. J. Pascoe, 1  1I have to call attention to the fact that so much of the most insightful work on masculinity\u2014Way, Bank, Hansford, Pascoe, Fehr, and others\u2014has been done by women. who spent a year embedded in an American high school divining and taxonomizing the structures of teen male identity in intricate and systemic detail. She concluded that \u201cachieving a masculine identity entails the repeated repudiation of the specter of failed masculinity\u201d\u2014in other words, boys must earn their gender over and over again, often by \u201clobbing homophobic epithets at one another.\u201d And unfortunately, for boys both gay and straight, the rise of gay marriage and queer visibility has not made schoolyards any more tolerant. In fact, Way, who still works with kids in New York City schools, warned that, in contrast to the unselfconscious way straight men can be physically affectionate in repressive societies, in cultures where being gay is a publicly viable option, boys actually feel even   more pressure to prove their straight identity. \u201cI hear that coming from all sorts of sources\u2014parents, kids,\u201d said Way, who notes the simultaneity of the rise of gay acceptance and the phrase \u201c no homo.\u201d\n Way discusses yet another\u00a0reason men may shut each other out: a major betrayal or insult we don\u2019t have the relationship skills to get past.

It\u2019s based on my experience looking at hundreds of beginning designer login flows, thanks to my courses  Learn UI Design and  Learn UX Design.\n   Ironically, the fundamental rule of interaction design is:  remove interaction. Remove clicks, remove reading, remove waiting, remove thinking.\n An easy example: if you know that  literally 95% of people opening a signup form will  immediately click into the first field,  save them the trouble and auto-focus on it.\n   The only things certain in life are (a) death and (b) email addresses have an \u201c@\u201d and a \u201c.\u201d in them. Fortunately, mobile phones have specialized email entry keyboards showing those characters \u2013 but you must label your textbox  type=email in HTML. This is such a simple change to make mobile users\u2019 lives easier.\n Note: also applies to telephone numbers ( type=tel), URLs ( type=url), and numbers ( type=num) in your signup flow.\n   Rather than waiting for the user to fill out  the entire form before you point out any errors, let them know  as soon as your system can tell there\u2019s an error. For something like email, it makes sense to validate on  blur (that is, when they focus on another field).\n Typically I\u2019d try to catch both  blank as well as  invalid email addresses.\n   Every single labelled text input you ever create should have clickable labels. It\u2019s a wonder this isn\u2019t done by HTML by default, but simply add the input element inside its respective label element and you\u2019re good to go. Not only does this (a) allow me to absentmindedly click the label to start typing, but (b) it also helps me if my clumsy finger accidentally misses the textbox by a bit.\n   No user should have to guess at what the password requirements are. Show them  when they\u2019re relevant (P.S. And remove them when they\u2019re not).\n   Allowing users to  view the password they\u2019ve entered will prevent thorny UX issues with choosing a password they didn\u2019t mean to \u2013 while also being less onerous than requiring them to type it twice.\n    You want your sign-in to be so simple, the village idiot could still complete it half asleep without thinking.\n To those ends, don\u2019t use, say, \u201cSign in\u201d and \u201cSign up\u201d \u2013 which requires me to think for half a second whether I want \u201cin\u201d or \u201cup\u201d.\n Instead, go with options like \u201cRegister\u201d vs. \u201cSign in\u201d, or other pairs of options that are more than 2 letters apart. It may only save your users a half a second, but if you wouldn\u2019t save them half a second  now, it\u2019s not looking good for the rest of your app \ud83d\ude2c.\n   In the case that someone  does click the wrong option, you want it to be dead simple for them to switch from registration and logging in \u2013 and vice versa.\n Most commonly, this is displayed as a link ( not a button\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a mistake beginning designers make weirdly often) located at the  bottom of the form.\n   Usernames are tough to remember for every individual service, and you may have been forced to pick something besides your usual. Emails are a much easier way to log in.\n   If the user guesses a password that\u2019s both (a) wrong and (b) doesn\u2019t meet the password requirements, say which requirement the password failed to meet. Much more useful than saying \u201cincorrect password\u201d, but not giving the user a clue as to how they might fix it.\n   Far too often, if you click \u201cForgot password\u201d, you\u2019ll be forced to re-enter an email you typed just 30 seconds before. By the time the user has exhausted their guesses at their password and wants to reset, don\u2019t pester them for information you already know.\n   Having looked at hundreds of signup flows from beginning designers, these tips address some of the most frequent problems I see. Implement all of them, and you\u2019ll have a login UX that feels, well, as noticeable as air.\n Remember: no one came to your app to log in. Heck, they probably didn\u2019t even come to use your app for its own sake. In all likelihood, unless your app is for entertainment, most users probably want to use it to achieve a specific goal  as quickly as possible, then get on with their life.\n As good UX designers, let\u2019s honor our users\u2019 impatience and make this stuff as simple as possible.\n  I\u2019ll walk you through  every part of a UI project \u2014 just like I\u2019ve done for everyone from  Fortune 100 companies to  Y-Combinator startups.\n    We use this field to detect spam bots.
