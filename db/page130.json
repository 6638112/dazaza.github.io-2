a face in the rock, like the Old Man on the Mountain famously minted on the New Hampshire quarter? Or perhaps you have seen clouds in the shape of dragons, or the face of Jesus on a piece of burnt toast? If so, you have experienced what psychologists call &#34; pareidolia&#34; \u2014\u00a0finding meaningful images in visual patterns.\n And while the experience of pareidolia is universal, few know that pareidolia is also an indication of\u00a0 creativity\u00a0and a fundamental feature of aesthetic appreciation. Recent scientific research into the neuroscience of &#34;spontaneous thought&#34; suggests that the source of pareidolia may be one of the reasons we love art and nature so much.\n Cognitive fluctuations are unpredictable changes in neural activity in the brain. \u00a0Their causes are presently unknown. Neuroscientists have been aware of these fluctuations since the 1930s, but typically averaged them out as &#34;background noise&#34; from other brain activity correlated to conscious thought.\n Recently, scientists have come to believe that so-called background noise in the brain may be more crucial to consciousness than previously thought. Recent research found that these fluctuations make up 95% of brain activity; conscious thoughts account for merely 5%. Cognitive fluctuations are like the dark matter or &#34;junk&#34; DNA of the brain, in that they make up the most significant part of what&#39;s happening but remain mysterious.\n Neuroscientists such as\u00a0 Georg Northoff,\u00a0 Robin Carhart-Harris, and\u00a0 Stanislas Dehaene\u00a0have been focusing their research on these fluctuations in the last fifteen years. They have concluded that neural fluctuations are not secondary, but fundamental for consciousness. Using technologies that measure the frequency and strength of large groups of neural fluctuations in the brain, scientists have discovered that brain waves tend to nest into one another, like syncopation in music. At the lowest frequencies, the drums lay down a beat, and the bass plays a rhythm. In between the notes of that rhythm, the guitar plays a melody. The song of consciousness builds up from spontaneous neural fluctuations.\n There are similar spontaneous fluctuations in the world, our bodies, and our brains. When sensory information from the world interacts with the brain, it creates unique &#34;diffractive&#34; patterns, similar to the colliding waves made by stones dropped into a pool of water. The world pulses with frequencies of sound and light like a drumbeat within which our bodies digest food, beat hearts, and pump lungs.\n Our brains do not represent the world, but rather respond to this stimuli with their own spontaneous fluctuations. They play between the waves with melodies that make up our thoughts and feelings. Like a jazz trio, the world, body, and brain have their own spontaneous fluctuations that are the basis of the creative improvisation we call reality.\n These fluctuations are also the source of our experience of\u00a0 pareidolia. When we let our minds wander and daydream, they become increasingly open to these divergent &#34;bottom-up&#34; diffractions and weak associations. Pareidolia occurs when our brains involuntarily experiment with seeing various &#34;top-down&#34; images such as animal shapes or faces in these fluctuations. In this improvisational state of mind, spontaneous thoughts and creative images rise like waves from the ocean of the unconscious and disappear\u00a0 again. This back-and-forth is an improvisational process that increases cognitive fluctuations in the brain and has\u00a0 therapeutic\u00a0effects similar to other\u00a0 activities\u00a0that increase\u00a0 cognitive flux.\n But why do we enjoy this state of being so much? Why do we prefer some plants, or some works of art, over others? Some sights and sounds tend to amplify these spontaneous fluctuations and others do not. For instance, scientists have shown that taking a walk outdoors tends to increase mind-wandering due to certain\u00a0 patterns\u00a0in nature called fractals. The same thing happens when we view these patterns and proportions in\u00a0 art. A fractal is a particular repeating coarse-grained to fine-grain pattern, such as a tree whose forking patterns  repeat in its branches, twigs, and leaf veins.\n When we look at the world, our unconscious eye movements or &#34;eye saccades&#34; also have a fractal pattern as they move over\u00a0 images. When we view fractal patterns with our fractal eye movements, our bodies become\u00a0 less stressed, and we mind-wander more as images emerge and disappear from conscious awareness. Even our brainwaves become more fractal and more interconnected when our minds\u00a0 wander. And this experience of reverie tends to feel good.\n  Want more health and science stories in your inbox? Subscribe to Salon&#39;s weekly newsletter  The Vulgar Scientist.\n  For instance, several recent studies have shown that people prefer to look at fractal patterns and artworks more than non-fractal ones and find them more aesthetically\u00a0 beautiful. Fractal images and sounds invite our eyes, bodies, and brains to play, wander, and make new associations at a mainly unconscious and involuntary level. We enjoy it even if when we do not consciously know why.\n As you might guess, fractals also increase pareidolia. Studies show that people tend to see more images in Rorschach ink-blot tests with a particular fractal\u00a0 dimension.\n But why is the play between body, brain, and world so widely experienced as pleasurable and beautiful? The physicist, Richard Taylor at the University of Oregon, speculates that humans are &#34;wired&#34; with a &#34; fractal fluency&#34; because we evolved surrounded by the natural fractal patterns of plants, clouds, and rocks. Studies confirm that fractals increase attention, pattern recognition, navigation, reduce stress, and have aesthetic appeal. Taylor argues fractals are also the source of our &#34;biophilia,&#34; or love of nature.\n What I find fascinating about the interrelation between cognitive fluctuations, mind wandering, and fractal patterns in art and nature is that they tend to be good for us in a uniquely\u00a0 playful\u00a0way. Nature does not dictate a single universal form of right action, healthy living, or beautiful art. Instead, some patterns let us play and experiment more or less. And it seems that our bodies prefer to play.\n But play can also be dangerous. Not all our experiments work, and some go wrong. Mind-wandering can lead to negative rumination, and not everyone prefers the same fractal aesthetics.\n But here is the takeaway: we are not biologically programmed to like or this or that object, but rather inclined to enjoy the process of play, improvisation, trial, and error in all things. In other words, recent research into mind wandering and fractals suggests that the process of creativity and unconscious play involved in making and experiencing art is a crucial source of aesthetic beauty and our love of nature.\n       Thomas Nail is Professor of Philosophy at the  University of Denver and author of numerous books and articles, some of which\u00a0can be read online\u00a0 here.

2000s, people think they know the story of Paris Hilton. So, when the 40-year-old released a YouTube documentary about her life last year, many were shocked to learn about her decades-long struggle with trauma.\n Hilton tearfully recounted how she was woken up by strangers in her bedroom in the middle of the night as a teenager and forcibly taken across the country. She said her unanswered cries for help repeatedly play out in nightmares which make it difficult to sleep.\n Her story, though shocking, is not unique. Hilton is one of thousands of American children sent every year by their parents into a private network of &#34;tough love&#34; residential programmes and schools marketed at reforming their behaviour.\n   &#34;My parents got me kidnapped and dropped off in the middle of the mountains,&#34; 21-year-old Daniel says in a TikTok video watched more than a million times.\n As a teenager, Daniel suffered anxiety and depression. He was 15 and had recently come out as gay when he self-harmed so severely that he required hospital care. It was in hospital that he was shaken awake in the middle of the night by two men. They told him the process could be easy or hard - depending on how much he resisted. With little fight left in him, Daniel went with the pair. But when he asked a stranger if he could use a telephone to call his parents on a brief stop for food, he says the escorts threatened him with handcuffs.\n  Daniel was sent to a wilderness programme in Utah where he spent 77 days living outdoors, hiking miles a day on rations. He vividly remembers feeling cold, hungry and dirty for weeks on end and witnessing others attempt to run away and try to take their own lives. Like many others sent to wilderness programmes, he was then enrolled directly into a long-term facility - this time in Montana - where he would spend another 15 months.\n  The Troubled Teen Industry (TTI) has become an umbrella term for a wide scope of private residential programmes like these aimed at modifying adolescent behaviour. From boot camps to boarding schools, these facilities are marketed as treatment for a broad range of behavioural and mental health issues including eating disorders, drug use and defiance.\n The people who took Hilton and Daniel were from companies specially marketed to families concerned about how their children might react to being enrolled in a programme. These youth transportation services are well-advertised and often come recommended, with parents typically paying a few thousand dollars to have their children taken from their beds and securely dropped off across the country.\n Parents are sometimes referred to the industry by third parties after feeling they have exhausted other means of getting their children help. Programmes sell themselves on high levels of anecdotal success, with testimonials from families and students on their marketing materials and in online reviews describing them as transformative and even life-saving.\n But for years, other former residents have been painting a very different picture of their time within these facilities, including in lawsuits and criminal complaints, alleging emotional and physical abuse.\n  The BBC has spoken to 20 people who identify as troubled teen survivors, aged from 20 to their late 40s, about their experiences within the industry over the last few decades.\n  Although their individual backgrounds and reasons for being sent away differ, patterns emerge across their accounts and the hundreds more shared in TTI survivor support networks online.\n The size of the industry and its yearly turnover of teenagers across the US remains elusive because there is no federal regulator monitoring it.\n   The US Government Accountability Office was tasked with investigating allegations of neglect and abuse across the industry in 2007, but found it difficult to grasp the national picture due to irregular licensing rules at the state level and ambiguity surrounding the labels facilities use to describe themselves - like boot camps or therapeutic boarding schools.\n Their investigators found thousands of allegations of abuse and examined a number of deaths at behavioural programmes across the US and in American-owned businesses operating abroad. Their reports raised concerns about the level of training required of staff as well as what they described as deceptive and questionable marketing practices aimed at parents.\n  Cynthia Clark Harvey was one of them. Her daughter Erica was just 15 when she died of heatstroke and dehydration on her first full day in a wilderness programme in Nevada in 2002.\n  Cynthia remembers her daughter as a bright, thoughtful and athletic young girl who had always done well academically until she began suffering from mental health problems aged 14. Her struggles led her to become suicidal and begin experimenting with illegal drugs. When Erica was admitted to hospital and excluded from school, the family felt frightened and out of their depth.\n   At the time, the situation felt drastic. Erica had been doing better but her psychiatrist recommended that residential treatment could help her path to recovery.\n The programme her family chose was well-known and accredited. They felt reassured Erica was in safe hands and would grow from the experience. After weeks of deliberation and planning, they travelled to Nevada under the guise of a family trip with her younger sister. When the deception was revealed, Erica became scared and angry and refused to get out of the car. After a turbulent hours-long group therapy session with other families, she and the other children were taken away.\n This was the last time Cynthia and her husband ever saw their daughter alive. By the time they got back home to Arizona the following evening, there was already a message waiting on their answering phone telling them to call. They were told Erica had an accident and staff were performing CPR.\n &#34;I don&#39;t remember the time frame, but at that point she probably had been dead already for quite some time,&#34; Cynthia says.\n   Erica&#39;s obituary could only say that she died hiking in Nevada. Her parents would not find out her cause of death for weeks - and it took years and a lawsuit for them to get records and find out the truth of what happened that day.\n Cynthia says they eventually settled with the programme for an undisclosed amount on the condition they could speak freely about the circumstances of their daughter&#39;s death. She learned Erica had been pushed to keep hiking as her condition worsened throughout the day. She later testified to Congress about how her daughter&#39;s distress had been mistaken for teenage belligerence by staff. Even after Erica fell off the trail into brush and rocks, she did not receive medical help for almost an hour.\n The remote location of the trek and a series of blunders in calling help to their location meant it took hours more for an emergency helicopter to arrive and take her to hospital where she was officially declared dead, long past the point her life could have been saved.\n Cynthia continues to grapple with regret and grief over what happened and came to connect with other parents who found themselves in the same unimaginable position. No criminal charges were ever filed over her daughter&#39;s death but 19 years on, Cynthia continues to speak publicly in favour of industry-wide reform.\n The National Association of Therapeutic Schools and Programs (Natsap) - the largest membership association of its kind - appeared on behalf of the industry in the congressional hearings, where it was grilled by lawmakers about the protections and checks in place.\n Natsap&#39;s website today says it and the industry have changed over time. It emphasises that it has ethical standards in place and requires members to be licensed by their appropriate state agency or a national accrediting body and have therapeutic services overseen by a qualified clinician, though it does not accredit facilities themselves.\n Campaigners argue that current levels of oversight are not enough. They say the lack of cohesive national monitoring has allowed bad actors to move around the industry and can enable facilities to rebrand under new names and distance themselves from complaints.\n In online networks they have built, people who identify as survivors of the industry connect and offer support across the country - pooling information and resources to track alleged abuses and a revolving door of programmes and staff. One Reddit forum on the topic has more than 20,000 members alone.\n   While a number of the more controversial programmes and organisations have closed down in recent years, allegations continue to plague the industry. A lot of the stories and experiences former residents recounted to the BBC had a lot in common - whether they got out decades ago or within the last couple of years.\n Many described arrival processes that left them feeling degraded and dehumanised. Those taken by transport companies described the process as disorienting and frightening. Some, including sex abuse victims, complained of invasive strip searches and examinations. One person, who was sent due to struggles with depression stemming from gender dysphoria, recounted undergoing a smear test as a virgin aged 14. Others described having their heads shaved and having blood and drugs testing despite having no history of substance abuse themselves.\n   Some claim to have witnessed and experienced practices like isolation and restraint and say they were also expected to punish and restrain others. Many of the systems they described were based on levels where active participation, including in &#34;attack therapy&#34; sessions where group members are expected to confront and criticise one another, was required to progress and gain basic privileges. Others described arbitrary physical labour, collective punishments and periods of mandated silence which could last weeks.\n They all described repressive environments with extreme limits and censorship of their contact with the outside world. Many believe their parents were misled about the reality of the programmes they enrolled them in, and describe rules that seeded mistrust between them and their families. Some recounted ongoing damage to relationships and enduring fears of opening up about their experiences, even after leaving, for fear of being sent back or not being believed.\n Some told the BBC they witnessed physical violence, self-harm and suicide attempts and many know other residents who took their own lives after leaving. Others have subsequently been diagnosed with conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder and say they continue to suffer long-term social difficulties, including in trusting in others, because of their experience.\n  In 2006, journalist Maia Szalavitz wrote a book that urged parents to seek evidence-based treatment for children instead of resorting to behavioural modification facilities. Her book traces the origins of many of the methods used in the industry, including confrontational group therapy, to controversial and discredited programmes from decades ago.\n Advocates for change say the teenage &#34;tough love&#34; industry, which first began to take off in the 1980s, has been able to endure decades of controversy in part because of social stigma surrounding the issues why parents seek help. It is not uncommon for teenagers to spend years within the system and monthly tuition, sometimes in the thousands, can mount up fast.\n Many, including Szalavitz, believe those referring families can exploit or exaggerate fears children will end up dead or incarcerated because of issues like drug abuse. Both her and Dr Kate Truitt, a clinical psychologist and neuroscientist who works with former residents, say the trauma experienced at these facilities can actually perpetuate or lead to long-term battles with addiction and abusive relationships.\n Many ex-residents, including some the BBC spoke to, say they initially viewed their treatment as justified and even advocated for others to send their children. Some took years to change their opinion of their programme after they reflected on their experiences.\n   Dr Truitt compares the trauma she has seen in some former residents to that experienced by former members of cults or prisoners of war. She points out that their experiences can be particularly damaging as adolescence is such a critical time for development.\n &#34;And because of the type of specific trauma they&#39;ve endured, most survivors don&#39;t feel safe seeking out treatment, because the people who were the treatment providers are the perpetrators,&#34; she tells the BBC.\n  Paris Hilton revealed she had already run away from a number of other placements before she was taken to Provo Canyon in Utah and kept for almost a year before she turned 18.\n The documentary This is Paris shows her reuniting with classmates as they go public with their ongoing trauma from alleged experiences of emotional and physical abuse there, including allegations of punishments like solitary confinement.\n  Provo Canyon remains open. A statement pinned to the top of their website says it was sold to new owners in 2000 and it cannot comment on operations or patient experiences before this time. They also say they do not use methods like seclusion or mechanical restraint now.\n Hilton&#39;s documentary has been watched almost 30 million times and she has continued vocal advocacy since its release.\n This role marks a drastic departure from the persona she built her celebrity brand and business empire around. Although her teenage history was already known among those who went through the same systems, they say having someone as high-profile come forward has helped bring credibility and awareness to the issue.\n People within the community say the documentary has empowered some to speak out about their experience for the first time. or has been used to help others, including parents, understand what they went through.\n   Some former residents have united under the idea of #BreakingCodeSilence, in reference to the periods of mandated social isolation used as a punishment and as a method of control in some facilities.\n &#34;One of the rules in many of these programmes is that you couldn&#39;t take anyone&#39;s phone number or name when you left. So, we were never meant to connect,&#34; Katherine McNamara, who went to Provo with Hilton, says about the groups that have emerged on social media. She and some others are now working together on a non-profit to help raise awareness, support those who identify as survivors and advocate for change.\n Other celebrities, including Paris Jackson and tattoo artist Kat von D, have been inspired by the documentary to come forward.\n Rapper Bhad Bhabie, real name Danielle Bregoli, has called for television personality Dr Phil to apologise for sending her and other teenagers to troubled teen facilities on his popular US show.\n It came after another former guest filed a lawsuit alleging she had been punished for reporting an alleged sexual assault by a staff member at the same therapeutic boarding ranch Bregoli was sent to. The facility, which the BBC contacted for a response, has previously denied the allegations against it and disputed their accounts.\n Phil McGraw said in an interview he was sad to hear of Bregoli&#39;s alleged bad experience but distanced himself and his show from her claims.\n  Younger people, once isolated from their teenage peers because of their experience, are using social media to try and break the stigma. Some have gained huge followings on platforms like TikTok from telling their stories. But none of this is not without personal risk - the BBC has seen legal letters sent to one content creator after they spoke publicly.\n Daniel has gained more than 240,000 followers and millions of likes since he started telling his and other people&#39;s stories last year. He now gets dozens of messages every day from others who went through similar situations and has had parents contact him to say they&#39;ve reconsidered plans to send their children away after seeing his videos.\n &#34;If my 15-year-old self knew that people were out there fighting for me, I would have felt so relieved,&#34; he says about the movement.\n  In some cases, social media has been a tool for tangible change. One woman, Amanda Householder, used TikTok to spread awareness of allegations surrounding her parents&#39; treatment of girls at a religious boarding ranch they were running in Missouri. Millions viewed her videos and eventually officials closed the school.\n   Householder testified to end religious exemptions in the state of Missouri that stopped even basic oversight of conditions at private religious facilities like the one her parents ran. She described the experience to the BBC as &#34;very cathartic\u2026 knowing that maybe in the future kids won&#39;t have to go through what we went through&#34; and says she hopes to give evidence in their criminal case.\n Hilton was part of a group who spoke at a hearing to convince lawmakers to introduce better protections in Utah - the state thought to have the biggest density of troubled teen facilities in the US.\n &#34;I don&#39;t know if my nightmares will ever go away, but I do know that there are hundreds of thousands of kids going through this, and maybe if I stop their nightmares, it will help me stop mine,&#34; she testified.\n    But a spokesperson for Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff&#39;s office confirmed to the BBC that he is working to update and re-introduce legislation aimed at prohibiting and ending abuse at residential treatment centres and increasing national oversight of such facilities.\n   &#34;It doesn&#39;t get better as the years go on, because it&#39;s just more milestones that go by,&#34; Cynthia reflects.\n It&#39;s been well over a decade since she took part in hearings pushing for federal regulation. But against all odds, she remains hopeful.\n Cynthia has been emboldened by the momentum building over the last year as more and more have come forward.\n &#34;When I first started doing my work after Erica&#39;s death, there were survivors out there, but they were not being listened to. And now they&#39;re starting to get listened to.&#34;\n Images of Paris Hilton taken by Kevin Ostajewski. Other images were supplied and Getty Stock.

and a &#34;parody&#34;\n Adelaide woman Tanya Watkins, a self-described &#34;captain&#34; of the church and\u00a0adherent of its creed of &#34;Pastafarianism&#34;, has made repeated attempts to secure the offbeat movement official status as\u00a0an incorporated association.\n After the latest attempt was knocked back by the Corporate Affairs Commission, Ms Watkins\u00a0sought a review of that decision, and the matter was subsequently referred to the South Australian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (SACAT).\n The tribunal heard evidence from the commission and from Ms Watkins, who contended that the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster was formed for a &#34;religious, educational, charitable or benevolent purpose&#34;, thereby meeting the criteria of South Australia&#39;s\u00a0Associations Incorporation Act.\n Ms Watkins told the tribunal the church placed emphasis on helping others, and\u00a0had engaged in acts of charity\u00a0such as an event at Flinders University\u00a0to &#34;feed the hungry&#34;.\n In a ruling handed down earlier this year, and recently published online, SACAT Senior Member Kathleen McEvoy rejected the arguments\u00a0for incorporation.\n &#34;Ms Watkins explained to the tribunal that she was seeking incorporation for the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster Australia in order that the association would be recognised as a not for profit organisation under the Act, and be a legal entity in its own right,&#34; Ms McEvoy stated.\n In the ruling, Ms McEvoy noted that while various &#34;Pastafarian texts&#34; are set out in traditional religious forms, they &#34;contain some surprising articulations&#34;, such as references to the books of the Bible as the &#34;Old Testicle&#34; and &#34;New Testicle&#34;.\n &#34;In particular there are numerous expressions which reference the texts of established religions, mimicking those texts in form and language, but in a clearly parodic form,&#34; Ms McEvoy wrote.\n &#34;I do not accept the applicant&#39;s\u00a0explanation of the use of these expressions (and numerous other similar expressions, many expressed in racist and sexist terms, referencing texts or practices of other religions) as examples of humour, and for the purpose of generating curiosity.&#34;\n  &#34;It is my view that the Pastafarian texts can only be read as parody or satire , namely,  an imitation of work made for comic effect. In my view, its purpose is to satirise or mock established religions, and it does so without discrimination,&#34; she wrote.\n  Ms McEvoy upheld the\u00a0Corporate Affairs Commission&#39;s decision that there was no evidence the church engaged in &#34;systematic teaching and learning processes, nor of any structured, consistent, and broad-based charitable activities&#34;.\n &#34;I am satisfied that the proposed incorporated association merely presents as having a religious purpose, but is a sham religion or a parody of religion,&#34; she wrote.\n &#34;It was not formed for a religious purpose. On this basis, to conclude it is eligible for incorporation as a body with a religious purpose could clearly not be a preferable decision.&#34;\n Ms Watkins told the ABC she found SACAT&#39;s decision &#34;quite disappointing&#34;, and said incorporation would have brought considerable benefits.\n &#34;If you&#39;ve got an association, then you should get it incorporated because then you&#39;ve got government oversight, you can run a bank account and all those sorts of things so we could be transparent and above board,&#34; she said.\n Ms Watkins rejected claims that the church was a &#34;sham&#34; and a &#34;hoax&#34;, which she said came &#34;from a misunderstanding&#34;.\n She said the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster\u00a0would continue to operate as an\u00a0unincorporated body.\n &#34;You&#39;ll find that there is a core group of people who really believe in Pastafarianism and that it can change people&#39;s lives for the better,&#34;

", "note_en": "Today&#39;s selection -- from  How to Invent Everything by Ryan North. If you should get transported back to pre-history, here\u2019s how to tan an animal skin:\n &#34;Tanning was originally invented in 7000 BCE. Without tanning, animal skins quickly rot, and even dried ones become hard, inflexible, and brittle. Tanning transforms these skins into leather: a substance so resistant to rot that leather shoes from 3500 BCE have survived into the modern era. It&#39;s something you&#39;ll definitely want to do, but you should keep in mind that preparing animal skins for tanning involves not only skin fermentation but also soaking them in urine and massaging them in poop slurries, so maybe set up your tanneries downwind.\n &#34;Immediately after slaughtering the animals, lay the skins flat and cover the fleshy side in salt or sand, which will dry them out and delay decomposi\u00adtion. In a few days the hides will become hard and almost crispy, and they can then be transported to your tanning area. Once there, you&#39;ll soak the hides: this cleans off dirt and gore and softens them up again. Scour the skins to remove any remaining flesh, then soak them in urine -- this loosens the hair, which can then be scraped off. You&#39;ll make the poop slurry we advertised earlier by mixing poo and water, and then soak your skins in that: enzymes in the poop will cause the skins to ferment, softening them and making them more flexible. You can help this process by standing in your poop slurry and kneading the skins with your feet -- just keep telling yourself you&#39;re crushing grapes -- but be sure to wash up with soap and water afterward, or better yet use nonhuman power (like a waterwheel) to knead the skins for you.\n &#34;After all this, two things will have happened: your animal skins will be soft, flexible, and ready for tanning, and nobody will want to get anywhere near you.\n &#34;To tan these skins, you&#39;ll need to collect some appropriately named &#39;tannins,&#39; which come from trees containing the equally appropriately named &#39;tannic acid.&#39; The bark from oak, chestnut, hemlock, and mangrove trees is high in tannin, as is the wood of cedar trees, redwood trees, and more. Tannins are brown, so if you&#39;re using wood instead of bark, look for red- or brown-colored wood, and keep in mind that hardwoods generally contain more tannin than softwoods. To extract tannins, shred your wood or bark and boil it in water for several hours. If you&#39;ve produced it already, adding baking soda to your water will make it more basic, which will draw out the tannins more effectively. You can repeat this process several times with the same bark to produce more dilute tannic solutions.\n &#34;After all this, the tanning process is actually the easiest part: just stretch the animal skins out and immerse them in your tannic solutions of gradually increasing concentrations for a few weeks. During this process, the stretched-out skins trade their moisture for tannins, altering the hide&#39;s protein structure to make it more flexible, more resistant to rotting, and water resistant. And that&#39;s it: you&#39;ve produced leather! Leather&#39;s useful not just for cool jackets; it&#39;s also for shoes, boots (you can make both entirely out of leather), harnesses, boats, can\u00adteens (leather can hold water without leaking, and it won&#39;t break when you drop it like pottery does), whips (fun fact: a whip-crack is actually the sound of a small sonic boom when the tip of the whip exceeds the speed of sound, so technically you&#39;re already inventing supersonic technology), and protective armor.\n &#34;If you prepare your skin but don&#39;t tan it, you&#39;ll produce rawhide, which soft\u00adens when wet but which has the useful property of hardening and contracting when dry. You can exploit that for binding: to attach a blade to a stick and make an ax, just wrap a strip of wet rawhide securely around both and let it dry. Besides making a delicious treat for your dogs (which we can only assume you&#39;ve already started breeding...), rawhide is useful in making drum skins, lampshades, and primitive horseshoes, and has\u00a0 even been used for casts. If you&#39;re doing that, though, be sure to leave some room for it to contract: wrapping limbs in too-tight rawhide has been used for torture. That&#39;s right: while rawhide contracting around hands and feet won&#39;t produce enough pressure to break bones, it will produce enough pressure to move those bones to places they don&#39;t normally go.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-19 11:55:57", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u52a8\u7269,animal,\u76ae\u80a4", "title": "\u6652\u9ed1\u52a8\u7269\u76ae\u80a4 ", "title_en": "Tanning an Animal Skin", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.delanceyplace.com/view-archives.php?4351", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u52a8\u7269", "animal", "\u76ae\u80a4"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "84d43a86d7f453d06fe4fb5dfb1f2e92.jpg", "infoid": 1066829, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4ee3\u8868Revlon\u7684\u53bb\u5e74\u82b1\u65d7\u96c6\u56e2\u8bd5\u56fe\u4e3aRevlon\uff06\uff0339;\u8d37\u6b3e\u4eba\u63d0\u4ea4780\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u5229\u606f\u652f\u4ed8\u3002\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e0d\u5c0f\u5fc3\u53d1\u9001\u4e868.93\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143 - \u8d37\u6b3e\u7684\u6574\u4e2a\u4f59\u989d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u662f2023\u5e74\u3002\n \u5f53\u4ed6\u4eec\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8bd5\u56fe\u62ff\u56de\u94b1\u3002\u4e00\u4e9b\u8d37\u6b3e\u4eba\u62d2\u7edd\u4e86\uff0c\u8ba9\u82b1\u65d7\u96c6\u56e2\u8d85\u51fa\u4e86\u5927\u7ea65\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u6848\u4ef6\u53bb\u4e86\u5ba1\u5224\uff0c\u672c\u5468\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u5c0f\u533a\u6cd5\u5b98\u5728\u66fc\u54c8\u987f\u7edf\u6cbb\u7740\u82b1\u65d7\u96c6\u56e2\u7684Jesse Furman\u3002\n \u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\u8fd9\u79cd\u9519\u8bef\u5417\uff1f\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u53ef\u6015\u7684\u7cdf\u7cd5\u7684UI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u8fd8\u6b3e\u5b89\u6392\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u5757\u540d\u4e3aFlexCube\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6267\u884c\u3002\u5f17\u66fc\u6cd5\u5b98\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\uff1a\n  \u5728FlexCube\u4e0a\uff0c\u6700\u7b80\u5355\u7684\uff08\u6216\u8bb8\u53ea\u662f\uff09\u6267\u884c\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f - \u652f\u4ed8Angelo Gordon\u8d37\u6b3e\u4eba\u4efd\u989d\u622a\u81f32020\u5e748\u670811\u65e5\u622a\u81f38\u670811\u65e5\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c062016\u5e74\u671f\u9650\u8d37\u6b3e\u4e0e\u5269\u4f59\u7684\u8d37\u6b3e\u4eba\u91cd\u7ec4 - \u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u5165\u5b83\uff0c\u4eff\u4f5b\u5168\u90e8\u652f\u4ed8\u8d37\u6b3e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e6\u53d1\u5e94\u8ba1\u7684\u5229\u606f\u652f\u4ed8\u7ed9\u6240\u6709\u8d37\u65b9\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5c06\u652f\u4ed8\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u90e8\u5206\u6307\u5411A\uff06\uff0334;\u6d17\u8d26\u6237\uff06\uff0334;

Instead they accidentally sent  $893 million--the entire balance of the loan, which was not due until 2023.\n When they realized their mistake, they tried to get the money back. Some of the lenders refused, leaving Citigroup out of roughly $500 million. The case went to trial, and  this week U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan ruled against Citigroup.\n How could an error like this possibly happen? Terrible, terrible UI design, as it turns out. First off we need to understand the mechanisms of the repayment arrangement, which is executed through a piece of financial software called Flexcube. As Judge Furman summarized:\n  On Flexcube, the easiest (or perhaps only) way to execute the transaction\u2014to pay the Angelo Gordon Lenders their share of the principal and interim interest owed as of August 11, 2020, and then to reconstitute the 2016 Term Loan with the remaining Lenders\u2014was to enter it in the system as if paying off the loan in its entirety, thereby triggering accrued interest payments to all Lenders, but to direct the principal portion of the payment to a &#34;wash account&#34;\u2014&#34;an internal Citibank account... to help ensure that money does not leave the bank.&#34;\n Ars Technica got ahold of a screenshot used in the case, which shows where the screw-up occurred:\n The actual work of entering this transaction into Flexcube fell to a subcontractor in India. He was presented with a Flexcube screen that looked like this:\n   The subcontractor thought that checking the &#34;principal&#34; checkbox and entering the number of a Citibank wash account would ensure that the principal payment would stay at Citibank. He was wrong. To prevent payment of the principal, the subcontractor actually needed to set the &#34;front&#34; and &#34;fund&#34; fields to the wash account as well as &#34;principal.&#34; The subcontractor didn&#39;t do that.\n Citibank&#39;s procedures require that three people sign off on a transaction of this size. In this case, that was the subcontractor, a colleague of his in India, and a senior Citibank official in Delaware. All three believed that setting the &#34;principal&#34; field to an internal wash account number would prevent payment of the principal. As he approved the transaction, the Delaware supervisor wrote: &#34;looks good, please proceed. Principal is going to wash.&#34;\n  It looked &#34;good&#34; to the senior supervisor because there are no design provisions to make it look bad. You would think, where an error of this magnitude was possible, the software designers would group certain buttons together, provide warning prompts, change colors from green to red, or a combination of these things. Instead the program appears to have been designed by an engineer in the &#39;90s.\n The upshot for you UI designers out there: Banks will certainly be looking for better software in the future, and willing to pay top dollar for it. There&#39;s a real opportunity here.\n      They&#39;ll actually just continue paying as little as humanly possible for disposable offshore contractors because that&#39;s what American banks do.\n  What else should we sub out? ooh, Let&#39;s subcontract the management of our heart beating to a company in India while we&#39;re at it. And yes, what a horrible software UI, however, most industrial software interfaces look like1993 and run on terrifyingly open systems and on 10 plus-year-old Operating Systems.", "posttime":

", "note_en": "NEW YORK (Reuters) -PayPal Holdings Inc will lift merchant costs for its branded payment products while cutting those for behind-the-scenes processing of some Visa and Mastercard transactions, a bold move in an increasingly competitive digital payments sector.\n  The strategic shift reflects PayPal\u2019s growing power in online transactions, which surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. As consumers and businesses flocked to the company, a market leader, during lockdown, its active accounts mounted to 377 million, more than twice as many as in 2015.\n The company said the move reflected the value of its proprietary services, with consumers nearly three times as likely to complete a purchase when PayPal products are available at checkout, while users of the new buy-now-pay-later option spend an average of 15% more.\n \u201cWe are changing prices to help our customers understand even more clearly where we provide value,\u201d Dan Leberman, PayPal\u2019s senior vice president for small and medium business and partners, said in an interview.\n    PayPal will charge sellers 3.49% plus 49 cents to process transactions made through its proprietary products, including its button on merchant websites and its digital wallet, according to material the company shared with Reuters.\n The higher rate applies to products like PayPal Checkout, Pay with Venmo, PayPal Credit and new buy-now-pay-later offering Pay in 4.\n PayPal has 392 million active accounts, including 31 million merchants globally, and also owns Venmo, Braintree and iZettle.\n It will be hard for merchants to know how much extra value they are getting from PayPal features in exchange for the higher rates, said Ben Dwyer, the founder of cardfellow.com who analyzes processing deals offered to merchants.\n \u201cPayPal wants to be a comprehensive payment solution, but it is tough to get there by selling on value over price.\u201d\n  Sellers will pay 2.59% plus 49 cents for PayPal to process, unseen by consumers, online payments made with Visa and Mastercard debit and credit cards from other companies.\n In the past, PayPal charged sellers 2.9% plus 30 cents for payments on most online transactions, regardless of its role.\n Lowering basic transaction processing rates helps PayPal compete with rivals including Stripe and Authorize.net. PayPal expects to acquire customers because of the discounts, Leberman said.\n \u201cWe think it\u2019s a bold price to come out with,\u201d he said.\n As large merchants tend to negotiate unique deals, rate hikes will largely affect small-to-medium sized businesses, some of which have lost confidence this year due to a nationwide labor shortage and inflation worries.\n  The changes largely reflect services PayPal has developed since splitting from eBay Inc in 2015.\n Although most of its transactions are online, PayPal will also reduce prices for in-person transactions through its network, which should help it compete with Square Inc.\n For most of those purchases over $10, PayPal will charge 1.90% plus 10 cents. For cheaper buys, the rate will usually be 2.40% plus 5 cents.\n PayPal\u2019s business boomed during the pandemic as more homebound consumers spent online. It processed $285 billion in payments in the first quarter, up 49% from the year-earlier period.\n \u201cIt\u2019s more than just pricing,\u201d said Aaron Press, an analyst at research company IDC. \u201cThey are making sure the market understands that they should be thinking of PayPal as a comprehensive payments strategy and not just one form of payment.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-19

$[0, X] \\times [0, Y]$, to intensities such as (R, G, B). To store it on computer memory, an image is  discretized to an array  array[H][W], where each element  array[i][j] is a  pixel.\n How does discretization work? How does a discrete pixel relate to the abstract notion of the underlying continuous image? These basic questions play an important role in computer graphics &amp; computer vision algorithms.\n This article discusses these low level details, and how they affect our CNN models and deep learning libraries. If you ever wonder which resize function to use or whether you should add/subtract 0.5 or 1 to some pixel coordinates, you may find answers here. Interestingly, these details have contributed to many accuracy improvements in Detectron and Detectron2.\n   Sampling theory tells us how a continuous 2D signal is turned into a discrete array by  sampling and  filtering.\n We choose a $H \\times W$ rectangular grid of points, from which we will draw samples. In order to make best use of the produced samples, we have to know the exact location every sample on this grid is chosen.\n Values on these sampled points are not directly retrieved from the original signal, but come from a filtering step that removes high-frequency components. Bad choice of filter can lead to aliasing effects.\n Sampling and filtering are both important in basic image processing operations, such as resize. Resize operation takes a discrete image, resamples it and creates a new image. The choice of sampling grid and sampling filter will then affect how such a basic operation is implemented.\n For example, the paper  On Buggy Resizing Libraries and Surprising Subtleties in FID Calculation studies the filtering issues, and shows that the resize operations in many libraries (OpenCV, PyTorch, TensorFlow) don&#39;t take into account the low-pass filtering. This then leads to incorrect deep learning evaluation.\n In this article, we ignore the issue of sampling filter, and only studies the  coordinates of sampling grid. We&#39;ll see that this choice is also inconsistent among libraries, and can affect the design and performance of CNN models.\n  Pixels are located on a sampling grid we choose. Naturally, we would like to only consider rectangular grids where pixels are spaced evenly. But there are many other factors to concern with:\n  (These terminology may have a different meaning elsewhere, but this is how I define them in this article.)\n For simplicity, we look at the one dimensional case instead. We want to answer this question: for a 1D signal defined on $[0, N]$, what is the sampling grid with stride=1? There are a few different choices:\n  In this figure, the green bars represent the 1D signal of length $N$, and blue dots represent the locations where point samples are taken. On top of each sample we labeled their  coordinates, while on the bottom are their zero-based  pixel indices. More formally, given a stride (which equals to 1 here), the offset and resolution of the grid are defined by the following table (assume $ \\frac{N}{stride}$ is an integer):\n $$ \\begin{array}{|c|ccc|} \\text{grid} &amp; \\text{offset} &amp; \\text{resolution} \\\\\\hline \u2460 &amp; 0 &amp; \\frac{N}{stride}+1 \\\\ \u2461 &amp; \\frac{stride}{2} &amp; \\frac{N}{stride} \\\\ \u2462 &amp; 0 &amp; \\frac{N}{stride} \\\\ \\end{array} $$\n They (or at least the first two) are all  valid interpretations when we are given an array of pixels. The interpretation we choose affects how we implement operations and models, because they each have some unique weird properties. To understand them more, let&#39;s check how a 2x resize operation should be implemented under each interpretation.\n  A unique undesired property of \u2460 is that, stride is not the inverse of resolution. So a 2x resize is ambiguous: we have to be clear whether we want half of stride, or twice more pixels. The new grids after resize look like these:\n    You can easily verify that the 4 different resized grids still match the corresponding definition in our table above.\n For 2D case, the 2x resize in \u2460(twice more pixels) and \u2461 look liks this (image credit:  here):\n   Extrapolation: \u2461 and \u2462 both need extrapolation outside the border of the original grid to perform resize, but \u2460 only needs interpolation. Extrapolation is sometimes undesirable.\n Asymmetry: \u2462 is asymmetric, and it&#39;s probably a good reason to never use it. One consequence is that  resize(flip(x)) != flip(resize(x)). All others are symmetric.\n Information Loss: in \u2460(half of stride) and \u2462 , about half of the points on the new grid exist in the old grid. By not having to interpolate their values, we minimize the loss of information. However, in \u2460(twice more pixels) and \u2461, most or all of the new pixels need to be recomputed.\n For resize with other arbitrary scale factor, all versions have information loss. But 2x/0.5x resize are most common in deep learning.\n The DeepLab series of segmentation models are famous for using grid \u2460(half of stride) for all the 2x resize. See  here for words from its author. This matches the inconvenient image shapes they use, such as 321x513. I&#39;ve heard opinions that the benefits of &#34;no information loss&#34; and &#34;no extrapolation&#34; may let it outperform \u2461 in segmentation, but I have yet to see more evidence.\n  What do libraries use? Situation is a bit messy. I&#39;ll list what I know and looking forward to your help to add more. No guarantee they are all correct, since I didn&#39;t check the source code for all of them.\n  TFv1  method=BILINEAR/NEAREST, align_corners=False: \u2462 TFv1  method=BILINEAR/NEAREST, align_corners=True: \u2460 TFv2  method=BILINEAR/NEAREST: \u2461 (In TFv2,  align_corners option was removed)\n It seems the mess is unique in the deep learning world. How come? From what I can tell, the history looks like this:\n TensorFlow is the first place that introduces \u2462, in its initial open source. This was later considered as  a bug and fixed in v2 (to not break compatibility in v1).\n align_corners=True(\u2460)  appeared in TensorFlow 0.7 in 2016. I guess this was probably intended for DeepLab development and not for general use.\n This means TensorFlow never had a proper resize function (grid \u2461) until TFv2! During all these years, the uncommon version (\u2460) and the wrong version (\u2462) have propagated to people&#39;s models and other libraries.\n PyTorch&#39;s  interpolate comes originally from  upsample operation. Nearest upsample was buggy when it&#39;s first  added in LuaTorch in 2014. Bilinear upsample was first  added in LuaTorch in 2016 and used grid \u2460. Grid \u2461 was  added in 2018 to PyTorch under an  align_corners=False option, and became the default since then.\n Due to this mess, resize operator in ONNX has to support  5 versions of coordinate transform! Kudos to ONNX maintainers.\n  Many computer graphics textbooks and papers talk about this topic and choose \u2461, for example:\n &#34;What Are the Coordinates of a Pixel?&#34; from  Graphics Gems. Explained again in  Real-time Rendering.\n (Note that some of them uses \u2461 but defines the continuous signal in the range $[-\\frac{stride}{2}, N-\\frac{stride}{2}]$. We&#39;ll discuss more about this.)\n Given all the graphics literature, computer vision and deep learning libraries promoting grid \u2461, we  use \u2461 as the convention.\n  We pick \u2461 as the convention for grid locations, but this is not the end of the story! We now know the grid locations  relative to the beginning of the signal are 0.5, 1.5, $\\cdots$, but what are their  absolute coordinates? In other words, where is the origin (0, 0) ?\n This is just a choice of convention and has no substantial effect on any algorithms. Two of the graphics literature I listed above put the origin on the first pixel. This has a benefit that all pixel locations have integer coordinates, but then it&#39;s weird that the signal lies on $[-0.5, N-0.5]$ This convention is sometimes referred to as &#34;integer centers&#34;.\n Another convention, &#34;integer corners&#34;, or &#34;half-integer centers&#34;, puts the origin on the beginning of the signal, so the first pixel is centered at (0.5, 0.5).  We chose integer corners, and then will have the following relationship between continuous coordinates and discrete pixel indices:\n  The choice doesn&#39;t matter for resize because absolute coordinates are never involved. However, for functions that accept or return absolute coordinates, we should be aware of their convention. For example:\n cv2.findContours returns integer polygons represented by indices. So we always add 0.5 pixel to its results to obtain coordinates that match our convention.\n cv2.warpAffine uses a coordinate system shifted by 0.5. It is complained in  this issue. In fact most OpenCV functions use the &#34;integer center&#34; convention.\n pycocotools.mask.frPyObjects can render polygons as masks. It accepts polygons that match our convention. Same for  PIL.ImageDraw.polygon, but its results are 0.5 pixel &#34;fatter&#34; due to how its implemented. This has affected cityscapes annotations.\n If a dataset is annotated with coordinates, we also need to know its choice of coordinate system. This information is often not provided by dataset owner, so we make guesses. For example, in COCO it appears that polygon annotations match our convention, but keypoint annotations do not and should be incremented by 0.5.\n Now that we have a convention for the coordinate system, it&#39;s a good practice in computer vision systems to  always use coordinates rather than indices to represent geometries, such as boxes and polygons. This is because indices are integers, and can easily lose precision during geometric operations. Using indices for bounding boxes has caused some issues in Detectron.\n  Models in  Detectron /  Detectron2 all involve localization of objects in images, so the convention of pixels and coordinates matters a lot. Various improvements and bugfixes in the two libraries are related to pixels.\n  In detection models, bounding box regression typically predicts &#34;deltas&#34; between the ground truth (GT) box and a reference box (e.g. anchor). In training, GT box is encoded to deltas as training target. In inference, the predicted deltas are decoded to become output box.\n Boxes in Detectron often use integer indices, instead of coordinates. So the width of a box is given by $x_1 - x_0 + 1$ instead of $x_1 - x_0$. Its box transform code looked like this for a long time (showing only one dimension for brevity):\n ref_x0, ref_x1: int  # the reference box ref_w = ref_x1 - ref_x0 +  1 ref_center = ref_x0 +  0.5 * ref_w    def   (x0, x1):  # given reference box and gt box  w = x1 - x0 +  1  center = x0 +  0.5 * w  dx = (center - ref_center) / ref_w  # delta between centers  dw = log(w / ref_w)  # delta between widths   return dx, dw    def   (dx, dw):  # given reference box and deltas  center = dx * ref_w + ref_center  # undo the encoding  w = exp(dw) * ref_w  x0, x1 = center -  0.5 * w, center +  0.5 * w   return x0, x1\n As innocent as the code seems, the two functions are not inverse of each other:  decode(encode(x0, x1)) != (x0, x1).  x1 is incorrectly decoded: it should be  center + 0.5 * w - 1 instead.\n This bug appeared in the  py-faster-rcnn project around 2015, and is  still there today. It was carried into Detectron and negatively affected results in the Mask R-CNN paper. Then it&#39;s  fixed in late 2017 after I found it, and contributed to an improvement of 0.4~0.7 box AP. Detectron went open source in 2018 with this fix. In Detectron2, we adopt the rule to always use floating point coordinates for boxes, so the issue no longer exists.\n  How to horizontally flip a geometry? Although pixel indices should be flipped by $i \\leftarrow W - 1 - i$, we should follow the rule to always use coordinates, and coordinates should be flipped by $x \\leftarrow W - x$ under &#34;integer corner&#34; system.\n Detectron isn&#39;t so rigorous on this and it  uses $W - 1 - x$ for coordinates. IIRC, fixing the issue leads to ~0.5 mask AP improvement.\n   The  code to generate anchors in Detectron is quite long, because it tries to generate integer-valued anchor boxes. By adopting coordinates for all boxes in Detectron2, integer boxes are not needed. This simplifies all the logic to just  a few lines of code.\n This does not affect accuracy, because the exact values of anchors are not that important as long as the same is used in training &amp; testing.\n  The RoIAlign operation crops a region from an image and resize it to certain shape. It&#39;s easy to make mistakes because two images and two coordinate systems are involved. Let&#39;s derive how to perform RoIAlign.\n  Given an image and a region (the green box), we want to resample a K $\\times$ K output image that corresponds to the region. W.l.o.g. we assume the input image has stride=1. Since we know the resolution and the absolute length of output, the output stride derived from the definition of grid \u2461 is $(\\frac{x_1 - x_0}{K}, \\frac{y_1-y_0}{K})$. Because grid offset is 0.5$\\times$stride, the location of output pixel  [i,j] is $$(x_0 + (0.5 + j)\\frac{x_1 - x_0}{K}, y_0 + (0.5 + i)\\frac{y_1 - y_0}{K})$$ Let&#39;s call it $(X, Y)$. To compute resampled values at location $(X, Y)$, an easy way is to do bilinear interpolation with its 4 nearest pixels (this corresponds to RoIAlign with  sampling_ratio=1). We show the 4 neighboring input pixels of  output[0,0] in the figure. The  indices of 4 nearest pixels of $(X, Y)$ are obtained after subtracting 0.5 to align their coordinate system:\n $$ \\begin{array}{l} A = \\text{input}[\\text{floor}(Y-0.5), \\text{floor}(X-0.5)] \\\\ B = \\text{input}[\\text{floor}(Y-0.5), \\text{ceil}(X-0.5)] \\\\ C = \\text{input}[\\text{ceil}(Y-0.5), \\text{floor}(X-0.5)] \\\\ D = \\text{input}[\\text{ceil}(Y-0.5), \\text{ceil}(X-0.5)] \\\\ \\end{array} $$\n The original implementation of RoIAlign in Detectron doesn&#39;t subtract 0.5 in the end, so it&#39;s actually not very aligned. It turns out this detail does not affect accuracy of R-CNNs, because RoIAlign is applied on CNN features, and CNN is believed to be able to fit slightly misaligned features.\n However, we have new use cases of RoIAlign in other places, e.g. to crop mask head training targets from the ground truth mask, so I fixed it in the detectron2 / torchvision RoIAlign with an   aligned=True option. Its  unittest demonstrates how the old version is misaligned.\n Btw, once we figured out the coordinate transform formula, it&#39;s easy to implement RoIAlign using  F.grid_sample. I had done the exercise and found this 10%-50% slower.\n  Mask R-CNN is trained to predict masks of fixed resolution (e.g. 28x28) restrained inside given boxes (we call it  &#34;RoIMask&#34;). But in the end we often want to obtain full-image masks. A &#34;paste mask&#34; operation is needed to paste the small RoIMask into the given region in the image.\n  This operation is an inverse of RoIAlign, so it should be implemented similar to our derivation above. In Detectron, this  was implemented with some magic rounding &amp; resize that are not exactly the inverse of RoIAlign. Fixing it in detectron2 increases the mask AP by 0.1~0.4.\n  PointRend is a segmentation method we created that focuses on point-wise features.  Pointly-Supervised Instance Segmentation, also from our team, uses point-wise annotations to train segmentation models. Both projects involve heavy use of point sampling and coordinate transforms. Having a clear convention of pixels and coordinates was important to their success.\n  Due to some sloppy code in the early days of deep learning libraries, today we&#39;re facing multiple versions of resize functions. Together with the two different coordinate system conventions, they easily cause hidden bugs in computer vision code.\n This article revisits these historical technical debts and shows how these fun details matter in modeling and training.

Some of them are troubling, such as the conspiratorial prejudice that has fuelled QAnon and the recent surge in violence against those of Asian descent. Others are restorative: the immersive worlds of books, the virtual realities of video games, the hypnotic lull of binge-streamed television series.\n Many of the escapes that we use to nourish ourselves originated in Japan. The stunning success of Nintendo\u2019s Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which sold thirty-one million copies worldwide last year, is a striking example. Now we have another, in the form of an imported anime with a mouthful of a title: \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba the Movie: Mugen Train.\u201d It d\u00e9buted in Japanese theatres in October of 2020, then arrived in American ones in April. It quickly set records for the highest-grossing opening weekend for a foreign film, as well as the highest-earning R-rated animated film. All of this has conspired to make it the planet\u2019s single  top-grossing film of 2020.\n This success might seem surprising, as anime has long been considered a fringe subculture, but the film\u2019s momentum was presaged by the enthusiasm of its reception in Japan. When \u201cMugen Train\u201d opened there, pandemic-weary audiences flocked to see it in theatres outfitted with socially distanced seating. By the end of the year, the film had emerged as more than simply a coronavirus phenomenon. It had done the unthinkable, unseating Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s 2001 epic, \u201cSpirited Away,\u201d to become the highest-grossing film in Japanese history. What Miyazaki\u2019s beloved film had earned over the course of nineteen years, \u201cMugen Train\u201d surpassed in just three months.\n It\u2019s tempting to frame the success of \u201cMugen Train\u201d as a passing of the torch from an elderly master to a younger generation\u2014and, indeed, Miyazaki has said that he considers the film a \u201c rival.\u201d (Miyazaki, who has announced his retirement numerous times over the decades, is currently working on what is purported to be his final film, titled \u201cHow Do You Live?\u201d) But \u201cMugen Train\u201d is the product of a very different creative process, and a very different media environment. Miyazaki\u2019s films are meditative, self-contained stories, created and financed independently, outside of the traditional corporate production committees that sustain Japan\u2019s commercial animation industry. He is an auteur who wears his politics on his sleeve, pens his own scripts, insists on checking nearly every frame himself, and long resisted merchandising his creations. In contrast, the hyperkinetic \u201cMugen Train\u201d is the latest installment in a series envisioned as a mass-market multimedia product from the very start. Tellingly, the vast majority of media coverage has focussed on its box-office success instead of its director, Haruo Sotozaki, or its writers, who aren\u2019t credited individually but under the name of the film\u2019s production company, Ufotable.\n  \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba the Movie: Mugen Train\u201d is the continuation of a hit television series called \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,\u201d which was, in turn, based upon a hit manga of the same title, by the artist Koyoharu Gotoge. The series is set in Japan\u2019s Taisho era, which lasted from 1912 to 1926; the precise date is never specified. The hero is Tanjiro Kamado, a boy who ekes out a living with his mother and siblings in the verdant mountains of a rapidly modernizing Japan. One day, Tanjiro returns from an errand to discover that his family has been slaughtered by demons: vicious monsters that roam the land in search of human blood. For these malevolent creatures, humans are both sustenance and a medium of reproduction, for once bitten, a human will inevitably turn demon. A blend of Western vampire lore and local Japanese folk traditions, the demons are dark mirrors of the human condition, their appearances varying wildly depending on whatever negative traits they possessed as humans. The lone survivor of this massacre is Tanjiro\u2019s sister Nezuko, who now teeters on the cusp of turning into a demon herself. Before Tanjiro can react, a mysterious warrior appears and tries to kill Nezuko; Tanjiro instinctively protects her. During the battle, it becomes clear that Nezuko has retained her human personality and is actively resisting her thirst for blood. The stranger fits Nezuko with a bamboo gag\u2014better safe than sorry\u2014then instructs Tanjiro to seek out a secret society called the Demon Slayer Corps. So it is that the siblings are thrust into a shadow war playing out between humanity and demon-kind.\n None of this context is explained in the film; instead, the backstory plays out across twenty-six blood-drenched television episodes, more than ten hours in total, available to stream on Netflix, Crunchyroll, and other platforms. \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba the Movie: Mugen Train\u201d picks up precisely where the series leaves off. There is no recap, and nothing in the way of exposition. Theatregoers are presumed to have their tickets, so to speak, for the train ride on which most of the film\u2019s action unfolds. (\u201cIt\u2019s almost impressive how fast \u2018Mugen Train\u2019 is able to completely disorient anyone who doesn\u2019t already know where it\u2019s going,\u201d IndieWire  wrote.)\n  Expecting such familiarity with a large amount of source material would seem an obstacle to mainstream success, but \u201cMugen Train\u201d had some help. Trapped indoors by  -19 restrictions, a lot of us turned to streaming platforms for solace, and a great many of the shows that we watched were anime. Netflix reported a fifty-per-cent increase in viewership of the genre compared to the year before.\n  \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba\u201d d\u00e9buted as a print manga, in February, 2016, in the pages of a magazine called  Weekly Shonen Jump. Launched in 1968,  Jump is one of Japan\u2019s oldest and most successful manga weeklies; at its peak, in the nineties, it sold more than six million copies every week. Key to the publication\u2019s enduring popularity is a calculated approach to cultivating talent, honed over the decades by an editorial department that carefully directs the output of freelance comic creators. Every issue of  Jump contains a postcard asking readers to rank their favorite titles; this data is then used to shape the direction of story lines in real time. The  Jump formula has produced some of Japan\u2019s most enduring pop-cultural hits, including \u201cDragon Ball,\u201d \u201cNaruto,\u201d \u201cOne Piece,\u201d and \u201cMy Hero Academia.\u201d It could be argued that, by teasing out episodes of manga via the \u201calgorithm\u201d of reader feedback, and then compiling the most popular series into separately sold stand-alone volumes that could be \u201cbinged\u201d all at once,  Jump presaged the way the world consumes streaming entertainment today.\n  From an artist\u2019s perspective, working for  Jump is something like a comic-book boot camp. In a story now enshrined in manga-industry lore, an editor at the magazine compelled the manga artist Akira Toriyama to submit five hundred pages of concepts before finally accepting the one that became his d\u00e9but, the scatological sci-fi comedy \u201c Dr. Slump.\u201d Artists, even established ones, submit to such gruelling oversight because the stakes are enormous. Afterward, Toriyama went on to make \u201c Dragon Ball,\u201d a martial-arts epic inspired in turns from Jackie Chan movies and the Ming-era Chinese epic \u201cJourney to the West.\u201d It went on to sell two hundred and sixty million copies worldwide. Six out of the ten best-selling manga series of all time originated in the  Jump offices. Landing a sustained hit in the weekly magazine virtually guarantees that the comic will be animated, merchandised, and transformed into a lucrative global franchise. This makes  Weekly Shonen Jump more than a publication: it is a dream factory for creators and consumers both.\n  The word  shonen means \u201cboy,\u201d but  shonen manga, as boys\u2019 comics are called in Japan, are widely read by both boys and girls. In spite of this mixed readership, however,  Weekly Shonen Jump has never employed a  female editor in its more than fifty years of operation. Part of the boys\u2019-club atmosphere is tradition. But, in this day and age, it\u2019s easy to question whether institutional sexism might play a role. When, in 2019, the  HuffPost officially queried whether a woman might ever be named an editor at the magazine,  Jump\u2019s publisher, Shueisha, responded that, while it wouldn\u2019t be without precedent, \u201cit\u2019s important to understand the hearts of boys,\u201d a sort of circular-logic non-response. Other hints can be found in the pages of the weekly itself. \u201cBakuman,\u201d a 2008 series chronicling the efforts of two high-school boys to make their professional artistic d\u00e9but in  Jump, describes the protagonists\u2019 ambitions as \u201cdreams that women will never be able to understand.\u201d It\u2019s puzzling to encounter such a contemptuous sentiment in the pages of the magazine\u2014particularly when you consider how many of Japan\u2019s most successful cartoon franchises, including \u201cFullmetal Alchemist\u201d and \u201cSailor Moon,\u201d are the handiwork of female creators. And more than a few popular series by women, such as Katsura Hoshino\u2019s \u201cD. Gray-man,\u201d have even been published in  Jump.\n Part of the mainstream success of \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba\u201d may in fact lay in its refreshing lack of gender stereotypes. In spite of the fact that co-star Nezuko spends the majority of the series muzzled with a piece of bamboo, she is no silent damsel in distress; as often as not she comes to Tanjiro&#39;s rescue in battle. Nor are the demons faceless fiends to be casually vanquished, \u00e0 la the shambling zombies of so many Western horror series: some are virtually indistinguishable from normal humans, while others are revealed to have tragic backstories that cast their motivations in a sympathetic light. The series\u2019 reclusive creator, who goes by the gender-neutral pen name Koyoharu Gotoge, has never revealed their identity, but the news magazine  Shukan Bunshun quotes an unidentified  Jump employee who describes the author as a thirtysomething female. If true, this would mean that the single most popular boys\u2019 manga series in history was actually created by a woman.\n \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d represents many transitions: between generations of artists, of course, but also from financially unpredictable auteurism to focus-tested corporate formulas better suited to the streaming era\u2014and, perhaps, from a male-dominated to a more inclusive way of crafting anime. So, too, does the movie herald a shift in the way that the planet dreams. Part of the success of \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba the Movie: Mugen Train\u201d is attributable to an unprecedented global situation that focussed the attention of so many millions on to the series via streaming platforms. But America is finally beginning to open up again, and \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d\u00a0\u2019s popularity shows no sign of flagging. Nor does the popularity of manga as a medium, the sales of which in America are significantly outstripping traditional American superhero fare. The film\u2019s reception seems to suggest that anime is finally poised to make its leap from the shadows of subculture into the mainstream. Streaming platforms have been quick to grasp the import. In December, Sony paid more than a billion dollars to acquire Netflix\u2019s biggest rival in streaming anime, Crunchyroll; Netflix, in turn, announced that it plans to fund and premi\u00e8re forty new anime series in 2021.\n In 1990, Joseph Nye, a Harvard professor of political science, first proposed a corollary to a nation\u2019s \u201chard power,\u201d its military forces or economic resources: \u201csoft power.\u201d He defined it in terms of \u201cwhen one country gets other countries to want what it wants.\u201d Most of his case studies focussed on the global proliferation of Western mores, ranging from democracy to rock and roll, but he also stressed that the currents of globalization flow both ways. \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d proves the point: when it comes to anime, at least, Japan has persuaded the world to want what it wants.\n    Sign up for our daily  newsletter to receive the best stories from  The New Yorker.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 11:12:15",

\n...... ", "note_en": "E ven before Seb had arrived at the prison, five weeks before my first visit, the staff had received a notification that he ought to be subject to close monitoring. While still in police custody, an out-of-hours forensic psychiatric assessment had been requested.\n Seb had been compliant with the arresting officers, but he had given the impression that he was unconcerned by what had happened \u2013 it seemed as though he didn\u2019t mind at all that he was being arrested. More bizarrely, there were flickers of apparent self-satisfaction. Seb had been arrested on suspicion of murdering his mother.\n  A nurse and the on-call doctor from the local forensic unit travelled to the police station, but Seb declined to come out of the cell to speak to them. Accompanied by police officers, the clinicians went to his cell to speak to him directly, but whatever they said, Seb stuck to the same line: he had nothing to say to them. He even resisted attempts to be drawn into casual conversation. The clinicians, along with the on-call consultant, agreed that Seb did not require admission to hospital. Having said that, this reticence, along with the particulars of the crime Seb had committed, left the assessors reluctant to rule out psychiatric issues completely.\n The next morning the doctor who had assessed Seb in the police station called the prison mental health team to recommend that, on arrival, he should be admitted to the healthcare wing for further monitoring. From their observations, the officers and nurses also felt that Seb was not quite right, though they found it difficult to put their finger on precisely why they felt that way. He kept a distance from everyone. When he spoke, he used as few words as possible to make his point, which was either a specific request \u2013 such as for clean towels \u2013 or more often to decline offers of help or support from the staff.\n He did not want to come out of the cell for meals or to relax in the day room. He seemed to be eating and sleeping well, and although he avoided contact, if they spoke to him he was not noticeably irritable and there had not been any aggression. That was, until the second night.\n  Just before the end of her long shift, one of the nurses went to check on Seb. She found him leaning on his sink looking into the small wall-mounted mirror. At first glance there was nothing unusual. During the debrief later, the nurse recalled that it was slightly odd that he did not react at all to her presence, but at the time she thought there was a mundane explanation; he seemed lost in his own thoughts.\n With only one foot in his cell, the nurse tried to get Seb\u2019s attention by calling his name. Then it was a bit of a blur. He must have sprung towards her and, as she made to leave the cell, wrapped his forearm around her neck, pulling her back. The staff heard her shout out, and the sound of her alarm, which she had activated by pressing the red button on her belt radio.\n Fortunately, it was only a few steps from the nurses\u2019 office to Seb\u2019s cell, but they were not expecting the strength with which Seb fought against their attempts to release his arm from their colleague\u2019s neck. A prison officer who arrived at the scene admitted that he felt he had no choice but to hit Seb on the head. With the help of officers who had run from other wings in response to the alarm, they were able to free the nurse and lock Seb back in his cell.\n After what was regarded as an attempted hostage-taking incident on the healthcare wing, Seb was assessed as too dangerous to remain there, and so when I visited him, I made my way to the segregation unit.\n  I  specialise in forensic psychiatry, a branch of medicine that deals with the assessment and treatment of offenders in prisons and secure hospitals, many of whom exhibit violent behaviour. I had been asked by Seb\u2019s legal team to offer an expert opinion on his mental state at the time of the offence. (To maintain patient confidentiality, Seb is not his real name and other identifiers have been altered.)\n As a regular visitor,  I knew the atmosphere on the unit was completely unpredictable; it could at times be eerily quiet, but frequently I had arrived in the \u201cseg\u201d to a cacophony of screams, shouts, howls and shuddering bangs that were made all the more unnerving by the sources of the noise being out of sight. The only opportunity for the residents of the bleak, single-occupancy cells to interact face to face with their fellow inmates was during their brief allotted time for exercise in individual caged pods running outside half the length of the building.\n Otherwise, communication was mostly done by shouting indiscriminately across the central space of the unit. Sometimes these were calls to welcome a new arrival who was in their fold, or to threaten ones who were not. Alternatively, the focus of their attention could be the officers; either to plead for something, or announce their aggressive intentions.\n Visitors to the unit often provoked renewed excitement. I used to wonder how the prisoners who already knew me could tell when I came on the wing, despite the doors and hatches being firmly shut. They\u2019d yell, \u201cDr Nathan, come here a minute, I need to speak to you,\u201d just after I passed their door. I realised later that they could spy through the narrow slit between the heavy metal door and its frame. When other prisoners heard about the presence of a doctor, they would shout out that they were ill and needed to see me urgently. Some probably required medical attention. Most were suffering from extreme isolation and craved any sort of interaction. The calls tended to subside once I had passed along the unit, or they would turn into other pleas and threats, as if the existence of other people also reminded them of their desires and grievances.\n  Seb was on what the officers call a \u201cthree-officer unlock\u201d. All segregation unit residents are only allowed out of their cells one at a time, but those who are considered particularly unpredictable, like Seb, require at least three officers to be on hand before the door to the cell can be opened.\n But when we got to his cell, Seb had covered himself entirely with his blanket and remained still. When the officer opened the door and announced why we were there, there was no sign of a response. Feeling self-conscious about talking to a blanket in front of an audience of three officers and a trainee doctor, I introduced myself to Seb and said that I was there to see if there was anything else that could be done to help.\n In the silence waiting for a response, I scanned his cell for anything of significance. During assessments of prisoners in the segregation unit, I have often found their cells to be in a state of disarray. The floor may be sodden after the occupant has blocked their lavatory as an act of dissent. Messages may be scrawled on fragments of paper or other surfaces. On occasion, faeces have been smeared on the walls in what is called a \u201cdirty protest\u201d. There were no such signs in Seb\u2019s cell. The very few possessions were arranged tidily on the floor against the furthest wall.\n As a last attempt to get his attention, the lead officer told Seb that soon there would not be another chance to speak to a doctor. It had no effect. Seb remained silent. Maintaining the direction of my gaze towards Seb, I carefully stepped backward out of the cell.\n My role in visiting prisoners like Seb is to help his legal team establish a picture of the defendant\u2019s mind so they can decide what plea he should enter. When I began practising forensic psychiatry 23 years ago, I quickly learned that anticipating questions that lawyers would ask required me to start thinking more deeply about the patient\u2019s mind than my psychiatric training had prepared me for. The court may be willing to take account of my evidence about the role of an unfortunate upbringing, or birth trauma on the actions of the defendant, but they would also need to hear how those particular factors are relevant \u2013 why their mental processes led them to commit this particular crime.\n Once I extended my practice beyond working on criminal trials and began appearing as an expert witness in family courts and in other types of legal proceedings, the limitations of an explanation based on a diagnosis or a list of causal factors became clear. It would be of little assistance to the family courts in deciding about the safe care of a child if I were to just present symptom names and the associated diagnostic label. From my assessment, I need to acquire an understanding of that person\u2019s subjective experience \u2013 their thoughts, feelings, emotions, perceptions \u2013 so that I can try to explain not only why they had behaved as they had, but also the circumstances that may increase the chances they would behave in that way again.\n  S eb\u2019s solicitor had requested an opinion on whether his client\u2019s mental state at the time of the offence amounted to insanity. The day after my unsuccessful assessment, I called his solicitor to let him know that Seb had refused to speak to me. Although the recent dramatic transformation of his personality with the development of eccentric behaviour, uncharacteristic violence and brooding reserve pointed to a \u201cdisease of the mind\u201d, until I could communicate with him, I was unable to determine whether that had caused him to not know what he was doing when he attacked his mother.\n Seb was not completely mute, but there was good reason to doubt his ability to make a proper defence to the charge of murder. My impression was that he was not being deliberately obstructive. I needed to come to a view on whether he could properly engage in the criminal proceedings; in other words, was he fit to plead? The final decision rests with the judge, having considered the evidence of two doctors. I filed my report to the solicitors stating that he was, in my opinion, unfit to plead.\n Until Seb agreed to speak, I was not going to be able to understand his mind. All the same, I was not content for him to stay in prison. There was enough evidence to make a case for assessment and treatment in hospital. Following liaison with a suitably secure forensic hospital and written recommendations to the Ministry of Justice, a warrant was issued for transfer.\n By the time we next met, six weeks later, Seb had been moved to a forensic hospital. I was reintroduced to him by a ward nurse who escorted him to the interview room. Before even having a chance to check whether he was any more communicative, I could see a change in his appearance. Many, but not necessarily all, of my patients who experience distressing psychotic experiences seem to gain significant benefit from antipsychotic medication, although unfortunately these often have side effects including weight gain. From Seb\u2019s heavier appearance, I suspected that he had been started on anti-psychotic medication.\n He told me that several months before his arrest he had started to feel overcome with waves of unease, which developed into a more relentless sense of foreboding and dread. Things around him didn\u2019t feel right. People had a dreamlike aura about them. He questioned whether they were who he thought they were. Then Seb\u2019s thoughts crystallised. It dawned on him that he was surrounded by imposters. The woman masquerading as his mother looked and behaved like her in every respect, but he could not shake his conviction that she was a charlatan, and that this imposter was involved in the abduction of his real mother. The usurper, who had cleverly adopted all his mother\u2019s characteristics, vehemently repudiated his allegations.\n He explained to me that he interpreted her protestations as a sign of how desperate she was to maintain the fraud. His tone became more earnest as he spoke about the offence, but he did not become overtly emotional. (It was as if his memory was not yet fully infused with emotion \u2013 whereas his words acknowledged responsibility for carrying out the offence, his tone was that of an objective spectator.) Seb had felt that his options were narrowing. He could not leave the charade unchallenged, but revealing to the imposter that he knew the truth could imperil his true mother. He wrestled with himself before the night when he finally stabbed the woman he believed was not his mother while she slept.\n Seb took the failure of his real mother to reappear to be a sign that the conspiracy ran deeper than he had previously thought. He decided that the best course of action was to avoid talking to anyone about what he knew. On the whole, he could suppress signs of his simmering frustration, but occasionally it became too much to bear \u2013 such as after the first couple of days on the healthcare wing, when he grabbed the nurse.\n The way Seb spoke to me showed that he was able to stand back from his former conspiracy-obsessed existence and question the veracity of his beliefs. I asked him when his perspective changed. He said he had acquired his new insights several weeks after his admission, around the same time that he started taking antipsychotic medication.\n  There was agreement about Seb\u2019s diagnosis. The presence of delusions in the absence of other psychotic symptoms such as voices or visions encouraged a diagnosis of delusional disorder, which falls within the same category as schizophrenia. There was also a term for the specific type of experience he had: Capgras syndrome, named after Joseph Capgras, who described the case of a middle-aged woman from Paris who, in June 1918, visited the local police commissioner to ask for two officers to accompany her and witness the evidence of a widespread crime. She reported that children were being illegally confined across Paris, including in the basement of her house. The police took her to an infirmary, from where she was admitted to Sainte-Anne mental asylum.\n After about a year, she was transferred to another asylum, Maison Blanche. There she came to the attention of Capgras, a psychiatrist who was interested in the themes of substitutions and disappearances that ran through her delusional beliefs. She believed she had been the victim of an abduction, and that she and others had identical doubles. She thought that \u201cthe theatre played out by these doubles is unbelievable\u201d. With a colleague, the psychiatrist published a report on this case, which they termed  illusion des sosies, or illusion of doubles.\n My medical training had taught me that, having found a term for a patient\u2019s condition and one for his symptoms, I had achieved sufficient understanding and the assessment was complete. But these terms only describe, they do not explain.\n To get to the underlying mechanisms that explain why Seb was experiencing symptoms, we needed to listen in detail to exactly what he was saying.\n  K nowing a little about the workings of the brain could help us interpret Seb\u2019s words. Seb claimed that the woman he killed appeared to have the same form as his mother, but a different identity. He acknowledged that he could not detect any difference in appearance between the imposter and his mother, but even so, he was sure this was not his mother.\n We know from brain scans on both humans and other primates that recognising other people relies heavily on facial images, and involves a number of different brain pathways. Disruption in this neural network can interfere with a person\u2019s ability to recognise the face of a familiar person, a condition that is known as prosopagnosia, literally meaning \u201cface ignorance\u201d.\n Seb\u2019s problem was not prosopagnosia. He could recognise the form of his mother\u2019s face. It was her identity that he questioned. Before the definable paranoid beliefs took hold, his perception of the world was accompanied by a general sense of doubt. He emphasised feelings of unreality; he was sure of nothing. Seb could not grasp a clear meaning, but there was an undertone of danger.\n Seb spoke of a jump from this early feeling of ambiguity and nebulous threat to the arrival of certainty. An idea came to him that helped resolve his confusion about the reality of the world around him (including his mother\u2019s identity) and to him it was consistent with his conspiratorial feelings. But while this idea \u2013 that his mother had been replaced by an imposter \u2013 matched his reality, it was out of kilter with everyone else\u2019s. And so, instead of rejecting the idea, Seb interpreted others\u2019 actions in a way that supported this idea. The belief that his mother\u2019s replacement was part of a wider plot gave meaning to his experiences and he selected evidence consistent with that meaning. In reaction to a loss of the sense of familiarity that had previously accompanied the visual image of his mother, Seb accepted a coherent yet false narrative.\n Neurobiological studies have improved our understanding of the origins of psychotic distortions of the sort experienced by Seb. But using only the language of brain chemicals and neuronal pathways is not sufficient. We have to retain the subjective perspective to truly understand human experience and behaviour. To explain violence, we must contextualise the physiology with psychological abstractions, such as impulses, urges and motives.\n  T he narrative that Seb had created was obviously a delusional one, but sometimes the basis of a narrative that supports a violent act is more difficult to judge. Most patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia are not violent. By chronicling forensic psychiatric cases, there is a risk of reinforcing the media cliche of the violent schizophrenic.\n On the contrary, my view is that such stereotypes are broken down by sympathetically examining real-life cases while emphasising their rarity. The diagnosis of schizophrenia relies in part on the identification of psychotic experiences such as delusional beliefs or hallucinatory voices. It comes as a surprise to many that these experiences are not uncommon among the general population.\n A clinical diagnosis requires the unusual experiences to be accompanied by high levels of distress and dysfunction. Some individuals suffering in this way may have periods when, to the observer, their behaviour appears bizarre. What has become increasingly clear to me in my practice is that diagnosis is not a particularly informative way of understanding behaviour. I have been involved in too many trials in which the central issue has been whether the criteria for a specific diagnosis were met.\n At the core of most motives for violence are assumptions about the intentions of others. Seb believed that a sinister collective was intent on keeping his mother hidden against her will.\n Understanding motivation is certainly important, but we also need to think about why hostile feelings are so seldom translated into homicidal actions. For most of us, even a flickering awareness of the consequences of our imagined aggression triggers negative feelings that prevent us from going through with a violent act. And since we are programmed to avoid negative feelings, we are inclined to suppress or resist the thoughts that cause them. If you were to imagine being the perpetrator of a violent attack on the person you love or care for most in the world, it is likely that you are immediately repulsed by the thought \u2013 that you imagine the horror in their reaction, the pain they would feel, the feelings of shock, betrayal, confusion. Thus adopting the emotional perspective of the victim is, for most people, enough to stop a violent impulse in its tracks. When we imagine a violent act from the perspective of the victim, we are demonstrating a type of empathy \u2013 we are imagining the mind of another.\n Empathy is a critical human ability and, when it comes to violence, it is powerfully inhibiting. So crucial are these processes that they do not even require conscious effort: they run behind the scenes, constantly inhibiting myriad counterproductive impulses.

"note_en": "We\u2019ve all heard this riddle: if you dig down deep enough in Windows 10, you\u2019ll find elements that date from Windows 3.x days. But is it actually true? In this article we\u2019ll discover just how many UI layers are in Windows and when they were first introduced.\n For the purpose of this experiment, I chose the latest Windows 10 Insider Build (as of February 6th, 2021), which is Windows 10 build 21301.\n   First, we begin with the latest and greatest, Fluent Design. Announced in 2017 and introduced with Windows 10 1803 update, Fluent Design is a major redesign of the Modern Design Language 2 (MDL2), aimed at bringing elements like Light, Depth, Motion, Material, and Scale. It also introduces the Reveal effects and the Acrylic translucent background.\n As of now, most of the inbox (UWP) applications have been upgraded to take use of Fluent elements, as well as some of the more front-facing elements, like the Start Menu, Activity Center and the Login Screen.\n Although Fluent Design was well appreciated, most of the enthusiasts considered this move too little, too late, as only a small subset of features have been enhanced with this new design style.\n   Just as we dig a bit deeper into the OS, we can see elements that haven\u2019t been upgraded since Windows 8/8.1.\n Some of these are glaring omissions, like the volume flyout, the USB flyout as well as some elements from the login screen.\n  Other Metro elements, although not as prominent, are the boot screen (which will soon be replaced with a newer one) and WinRE\n   Did you know: the first time the spinning dots were introduced was in Windows 8 build 7989.\n  Just like Windows 10, Windows 8 was also plagued with inconsistency issues (for better or for worse). However, Windows 8 added meaningful enhancements to major user elements, like the Windows Explorer or Task Manager. Although they would receive some quality-of-life improvements in subsequent Windows 10 updates, changes would be minimal.\n Also, an important change brought by Windows 8 was the redesign of the File Transfer dialogs.\n  Some of these changes started in Windows 7, which brings us to the fourth layer:\n  Windows 7 is without doubt one of the most beloved versions of Windows of all time, praised for its great enhancements over Windows Vista. It brought many new features that, although weren\u2019t as significant as those that Vista introduces, made Windows 7 a very solid OS, and a true successor to Windows XP. However, one of the most infamous changes brought with Windows 7 is the Ribbon UI, which is a feature ported from Office 2007. Some of the apps that got updated with the new Ribbon UI are Paint and Wordpad.\n Although at some point Microsoft decided to deprecate the classic Paint in favor of the new Paint 3D (introduced with Windows 10 Creators Update), after major backlash, they reversed their decision.\n  Other features that were updated in Windows 7 and remained the same ever since are: Windows Media Player 12, Remote Desktop Connection and some file dialogs.\n   Windows Vista was a monumental Windows release, one that brought much needed modernization to the platform. Almost all of the fundamentals of the OS have been in some way or another improved, from the bootloader to the driver model. However, as we all know by now, Windows Vista would come to be one of the worst Windows releases ever, plagued with issues from the beginning. One of the few features that were praised, though, was the UI. It redesigned some of the fundamentals that haven\u2019t been updated since Windows 95. One of the main promotors of this change was the introduction of the so-called Aero Wizards, replaced the previous wizard standard, Wizard97.\n  Other features that were redesigned in Windows Vista and are basically the same in Windows 10: the Control Panel, the Search program, Windows Fax and Scan.\n  Speaking of Windows Vista: did you know that in certain special circumstances Windows 10 falls back to the Vista boot screen? It happens when your video card doesn\u2019t support the video mode that the standard boot screen uses.\n  Believe it or not, there are not that many XP elements embedded into Windows 10. That\u2019s probably because most of the fundamentals were updated already into Windows 2000. However, Windows 10 contains some file dialogs from XP, which are seen when one is installing a driver.\n   Windows 2000 was a big milestone for the NT lineup of operating systems from Microsoft. It also was the stepping stone that would signal the start the transition to a new, unified Windows vision. However, Windows 2000 was still a business-oriented OS, which means that it brought a lot of new features designed for experts.\n One of the most significant addition is the Management Console (MMC), whose UI elements are basically the same ever since.\n  Another feature introduced by default in Windows 2000 is Windows Installer, which still has the same icon from when it was first introduced!\n  Another UI element that hasn\u2019t changed (apart from branding, of course) is winver, whose design was introduced in Windows 2000 build 1946.\n  While Windows 2000 introduced lots of features aimed for power users, Windows 95 is probably the most significant Windows release to date. It introduced fundamental paradigms that still hold to this day. It introduced features like the Start Menu, context menus, the taskbar and recycle bin. While these features were of course updated over the course of many years, some remained almost exactly the same.\n  An element that is basically a relic of the older computing habits, where one had to protect their precious CRT screen is the screensaver settings.\n    One more common UI element that passed the test of time is the folder properties screen.\n  And there are so many more UI elements that haven\u2019t been touched since Windows 95. Is this a case of timeless design? I\u2019ll let you judge for yourself.\n  Well, this is not really a \u201cUI layer\u201d, as I haven\u2019t been able to find any interface elements predating Windows 95 (although I have a feeling that there certainly are). However, there is a peculiar file in Windows 10, called moricons.dll, which contains a lot of old icons from the DOS days. Take a look:\n  Well, that\u2019s pretty much it. As you may know, Microsoft is planning on overhauling the UI of Windows with their \u201cSun Valley\u201d update, which aims to unify the design of the OS. However, as we can see, Windows is one behemoth of an operating system. Will their efforts to finally make a cohesive user experience succeed? Only time will tell.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 10:29:21", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "windows,windows-10", "title": "Windows\u7684\u72b6\u6001\uff1aWindows 10\u4e2d\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u5c42UI\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1f ", "title_en": "State of the Windows: How many layers of UI inconsistencies are in Windows 10?", "transed": 1, "url": "https://ntdotdev.wordpress.com/2021/02/06/state-of-the-windows-how-many-layers-of-ui-inconsistencies-are-in-windows-10/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["windows"]}]
