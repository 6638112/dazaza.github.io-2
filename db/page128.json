There are currently 33 active large fires across the West. The biggest has scorched more than 175,000 acres in the canyons and valleys east of Phoenix. It is 73% contained.\n    A record-breaking heat wave across the West this week isn&#39;t helping ease fire danger. Temperatures have soared into the triple digits in Salt Lake City, Las Vegas and Montana, where new wildfires are sparking weeks earlier than normal.\n    They include a 24,000-acre fire burning northeast of Yellowstone National Park near the town of Red Lodge, Mont. It has destroyed 18 structures so far and is 0% contained. The timber and grasses there are unusually dry for this time of year.\n    &#34;It&#39;s not very typical,&#34; said Billy Chapman, public information officer at Custer-Gallatin National Forest. &#34;I think a lot of it&#39;s the heat. We have not had any spring rain really.&#34;\n  Chapman predicts a severe wildfire season if the abnormally warm temperatures and dry conditions continue into the summer.\n  &#34;Things could change \u2013 and I hope they do \u2013 but this is not a good trend,&#34; he said.\n  High winds have fueled another large fire burning near Montana&#39;s capital, Helena, where a state Department of Natural Resources and Conservation helicopter crash-landed while battling the blaze. All five crew members survived with minor injuries.\n An earlier version of this story said in a photo caption that the Robertson Draw Fire was south of Buffalo, Wyo. In fact, it is south of Red Lodge, Mont.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 15:32:32", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u91ce\u706b,high,\u706b\u707e", "title":

", "note_en": "A  video posted by the Australian restaurant  Crux on TikTok last month shows something you\u2019d expect from any influencer filming their Sunday brunch: A knife slowly breaks an egg\u2014blanketed in hollandaise, as any good eggs Benedict is\u2014until golden yolk oozes out. But appearances are deceiving, and as the text overlaid onto the clip makes clear: Yes, it\u2019s vegan. And yes, it pops.\n  For vegans,  lacto-vegetarians, and anyone else cutting their egg consumption, there have long been many ways to replace the functions of the egg. Flax seeds, chia seeds, bananas, applesauce, and starch blends like Ener-G Egg Replacer perform the binding tasks that eggs do so well\u2014a guide to which can be found  in Taste. Tofu can be scrambled, and chickpea flour can be cooked into a thin, omelette-esque sheet. Other commercial egg replacer options are on the rise as veganism  sees an exciting heyday.\n  Follow Your Heart, the 50-year-old leader in the plant-based space, launched a substitute intended for scrambles  in 2015.  Vegg sells egg replacer products including a  powder meant to simulate the taste and texture of egg yolks in dishes like French toast. The juggernaut is  JUST Egg, whose mung bean-based liquid that scrambles like real eggs, hit the United States  in 2018. By March of this year, when JUST  received a $200 million investment backed by the Qatar Investment Authority,\u00a0 the company had sold the equivalent of 100 million chicken eggs. Chicken eggs remain big business:  In 2019, Americans were eating about 279 eggs per person per year\u2014the highest egg consumption in almost 50 years, the  Washington Post reported.\n  But there\u2019s a particular pleasure that commercial vegan products haven\u2019t yet captured: the egg yolk in all of its gooey, globular, food porn-y glory. The yolk, after all, has much to do with the indulgent Instagram appeal of \u201c putting  an egg  on it,\u201d whether \u201cit\u201d is a pizza, a burger, or a breakfast hash. For those who don\u2019t want to give up the concept of the egg entirely, the vegan egg with silky whites and a spherical liquid yolk is elusive but not out of reach. This is how obsessed cooks in home and restaurant kitchens have tinkered with science to make the plant-based yolk pop possible.\n  Crux, which opened in Adelaide in 2018, offers vegan eggs two ways. The eggs Benedict contains their poached version, which uses a cashew base for the whites and tomatoes for the yolks. The breakfast sandwich features their facsimile of a fried egg, complete with shiny, soy-based whites with lacy edges and the same bubble of a yolk. Though you can tell that the egg yolks\u2019 main components are tomatoes and soy, the texture and flavor of the whites in both versions is spot on, says Crux owner George Thomson. \u201cCustomers are constantly commenting about how what we do is considered \u2018wizardry.\u2019\u201d\n  The process of developing Crux\u2019s vegan eggs \u201cabsolutely consumed\u201d Thomson, who has been vegan for about five years. \u201cI saw people making vegan \u2018fried eggs\u2019 online, and I thought,  I could do that better,\u201d he said. YouTube alone offers many methods. In 2018, Ellie Bullen of the blog Elsa\u2019s Wholesome Life shared a much-imitated video in which she  blended pumpkin into a yellow mixture and then dolloped it onto a circle made of flour and coconut milk. Emmy Cho of Emmymade  riffed on that recipe using eggfruit, the colloquial name for canistel; when it\u2019s ripe, the fruit, which comes from a tree native to Central America,  is compared to the texture of a hard-boiled egg yolk. Where these recipes fall short, though, is that the \u201cyolks\u201d aren\u2019t poppable, but rather a spoonful of sauce atop what is effectively a white pancake.\n   A raw chicken egg yolk is a liquid mixture of protein, fat, water, and minerals that\u2019s encased in a  transparent membrane, which keeps the yolk separate from the albumen that makes up the egg whites. To make a vegan egg yolk that behaves similarly, then, replicating that membrane is crucial.\n  Patented in the 1940s by food scientist William Peschardt, spherification is a technique that traps a liquid in a thin gel membrane. Peschardt suggested it for use in \u201cartificial edible cherries, soft sheets, and the like.\u201d The process works  by mixing an edible liquid that contains no calcium with sodium alginate, and then dropping it into a calcium salt bath. (There\u2019s also  reverse spherification, which involves dripping a calcium-containing substance into an alginate bath.) When the sodium alginate meets the calcium ions,  the ions bind together, giving the drops of liquid a gel skin.\n  Spherification really entered public consciousness in 2003, when the Spanish restaurant El Bulli\u2014which won World\u2019s Best Restaurant the previous year, and every year from 2006 to 2009\u2014 began using it and gained acclaim for dishes like  an \u201colive\u201d made out of olive juice. El Bulli and chef Ferran Adri\u00e0 were leaders in the cooking movement that\u2019s sometimes referred to as \u201cmolecular gastronomy,\u201d though many chefs associated with it use terms like \u201c modernist cuisine.\u201d\n  Credited to physicist Nicholas Kurti and chemist Herv\u00e9 This and dating to 1988,  molecular gastronomy is a field of study that explores the science behind cooking in home and restaurant kitchens. (\u201c Food science,\u201d by comparison, generally refers to the study of industrial food production, safety, and nutrition.) The term was also used\u2014mistakenly,  according to Encyclopedia Britannica\u2014to refer to the use of science to create new dishes and cooking techniques. Thanks to the work of chefs like Adri\u00e0, Heston Blumenthal, and Wylie Dusfresne in the late 1990s to early 2000s, \u201cmolecular gastronomy,\u201d despite the potential misnomer, became synonymous with foods in formats like foams, gels, and spheres.\n  Dufresne, who was known for his love of eggs, even served a  coconut-carrot mixture designed to look like a sunny-side-up egg at his New York City restaurant WD-50, which was  open from 2003 to 2014. (In 2007, Dufresne\u2019s \u201cegg\u201d became the subject of brief food world controversy when  Top Chef\u2019s Marcel Vigneron \u201c ripped [it] off\u201d with his \u201c cyber egg\u201d that was featured in  Wired.)\n  Today, Crux\u2014which is focused on \u201cboundary-pushing vegan food\u201d\u2014uses spherification to turn a tomato-based mixture into its vegan egg yolk. A similar technique using tomatoes was popularized online in a  2019 Insider video about the Los Angeles vegan restaurant  Crossroads Kitchen, which has been serving a tomato yolk  since at least 2016. New Paltz, New York\u2019s  Lagusta\u2019s Luscious Commissary, which opened in 2016, created its own \u201c molecular egg\u201d to serve on top of ramen. But Crossroads Kitchen\u2019s tomato technique got even more attention last year when Buzzfeed\u2019s  Goodful tried it in a video that has almost 4 million views as of this writing. The method is now making the rounds on TikTok: In addition to Crux\u2019s clips, a tomato-based vegan egg appears in  a TikTok posted by the user @oprahwinfrey.car1 earlier this month and which currently has 3.5 million views. Crux also uses spherification with a cashew-based mixture to make the rest of its vegan poached egg.\n  Lisa Kitahara of the food blog  Okonomi Kitchen developed her  vegan egg yolk recipe because she missed the tamago kake gohan, a comfort food of raw egg mixed into hot rice, that she would eat when her family visited Japan every year. She also uses the spherification technique, but instead of tomatoes, which she found \u201ctoo juicy,\u201d she\u2019s found success using squash, carrots, or sweet potatoes to make an egg yolk base that\u2019s smooth and buttery.\n  Another key ingredient in Kitahara\u2019s take on tamago kake gohan is nagaimo, a mountain yam, which she grates raw into her bowl of rice before adding the egg yolk. \u201cIt kind of mimics that slimy texture that eggs have,\u201d she said. She also uses nagaimo in her  vegan take on kaki fry, or Japanese-style fried oysters. In that recipe, nagaimo acts in the place of eggs to bind the mixture she uses to dredge oyster mushrooms, and it also adds a sliminess that\u2019s reminiscent of an oyster from the sea.\n  There\u2019s more to an egg yolk than form, and a common flavor element in many vegan egg recipes including Kitahara\u2019s and Thomson\u2019s is  kala namak, also known as Indian or Himalayan black salt. Unlike  Hawaiian black salts that contain activated charcoal, kala namak  contains sulfur compounds that evoke the smell and flavor of eggs. One of these is hydrogen sulfide,  which is responsible for the smell of eggs, from hunger-inducing to spoiled rotten.\n  Why these techniques aren\u2019t more popular in a commercial or even restaurant sense might be because of the effort that goes into making them. After Thomson developed a successful prototype of his vegan egg, his next challenge was making it on a larger scale, a process that took months. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to make a handful of vegan \u2018poached eggs,\u2019 it\u2019s a whole different game to create thousands of them in a commercial environment,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth the vegan \u2018fried eggs\u2019 and vegan \u2018poached eggs\u2019 take tremendous amounts of energy to create, even after perfecting both methods.\u201d\n  Though Kitahara has put a recipe for her vegan egg yolk on her blog, she plans to continue experimenting with the process. She\u2019d like to eventually tackle a version of  onsen tamago (\u201chot springs eggs\u201d in Japanese),\u00a0 eggs slowly cooked at a temperature below boiling until they\u2019re silky, soft, and custardy.

During my early 20s, I lived in the skeptic blogosphere, a mid-2000s constellation of internet communities theoretically organized around highly charismatic bloggers, vloggers, and other intellectuals. In practice, however, these groups were centered on a more basic principle: hostility toward anyone and anything it deemed &#34;irrational.&#34; It was then and is still now a very white, male, and defensive place.\n  It was there that I developed a deep antipathy toward the anti-vaccination movement. It wasn&#39;t that I knew they were wrong about vaccines. It was more than that. I believed myself intellectually and morally superior to those people, and I reinforced that belief each time I left a comment or watched a vlog or republished a snarky article on the subject. I mastered a face, a kind of appalled, disapproving look for any time anybody even broached the subject of vaccine skepticism.\n          I met my wife nine years ago. I wanted to take up swing dancing and decided to take a private class to get over some of my anxiety. She was the teacher who picked up the phone when I called.\n  I was immediately attracted to her, but at the time she was engaged to her dancing partner, the father of her daughter.\n  So at first we built a platonic friendship. We spent time together. We bonded over our mutual interest in dancing. I had known her for more than a year the first time she mentioned that her daughter was not vaccinated.\n  What do you do, then, when someone you believe is both smart and sensible comes to a conclusion you find completely wrong? Does that person stop being smart at that precise moment?\n  My time reading (arrogant) skeptic blogs had convinced me of my moral and intellectual superiority. I believed that  because I was a smart, sensible, and empathetic person I could see the value of vaccines. Yet here this woman was. I knew she wasn&#39;t dumb \u2014 in fact, I thought she was very insightful. I knew she wasn&#39;t dangerous or conspiratorial \u2014 we had talked for days about how we care about people, and the society we live in, and what it means to be human. I already trusted her.\n  Did I have to completely reassess my opinion of this person? Did I have to examine my own biases and mental caricatures, decide that anti-vaxxers  are people too?\n  Well, no. I did what most people did: opted for cognitive dissonance. I decided it wasn&#39;t worth getting into a fight over, that she could be my friend and have weird opinions about vaccines at the same time. Even as she broke up with her partner, and I broke up with mine, and we found ourselves spending a lot of time together, I ignored the issue. The subject of vaccines came up once or twice over dinners, but so what? I could see she loved and cared deeply for her daughter. She was someone I admired and respected and was beginning to love. Vaccines didn&#39;t get in the way.\n  And, of course, I believed that if we spent enough time together, I&#39;d eventually change her mind.\n      This is the beating heart of any real discussion about anti-vaxxers. It&#39;s impossible to understand their position without considering the amount of fear that goes into the anti-vaccine narrative, and considering how people construct and deal with fear.\n    Now, you might think that a fear is a fear and public health is something else \u2014 and you might be right. That&#39;s the rational point of view. But then, how rational are your own fears?\n  Maybe you&#39;re afraid of heights. Maybe it&#39;s spiders. In either case, you&#39;re lucky: Coping with your fear the way most people do \u2014 avoidance \u2014 doesn&#39;t come at a cost to others. But vaccines only work when everyone buys in. Public health depends on anti-vaxxers confronting their greatest fears for the benefit of others.\n  For people who don&#39;t share their fear, it&#39;s very easy and convenient to demand that anti-vaxxers just suck it up and take the shot. I wish they would, too. But we&#39;ll never get there by bullying them, by insulting and demeaning them and refusing to take the fact of their fear seriously, even if there isn&#39;t much that&#39;s serious in its content.\n  That&#39;s hard to do. Have you ever tried to stare a loved one into the eye and tell her you are going to put her child in danger?\n  Despite initially avoiding the subject, I decided, after we were married, that I should convince my wife to vaccinate her daughter. Vaccines are good, after all. Vaccines are safe. Measles outbreaks had been on the news \u2014 what better time to raise the subject?\n  But when I did, I realized that from her perspective, all of my confrontational reasoning sounded like me asking to point a gun at her daughter and have her trust that it was full of blanks. Looking into her eyes, I realized her trust in me was threatened. She asked why I would do that to a child. All of my insistence that vaccines are safe didn&#39;t matter. Go tell arachnophobic parents that you must put spiders on their child because society depends on it, and see how that goes. The benefits of getting the shot, expressed in the abstract, simply could not overpower the immediate, disarming fear.\n  So I backed down. The anti-vax position was not a deal breaker for me, but suggesting that we should expose her daughter to grave dangers for no good reason was a deal breaker for my wife. I loved my wife. I had no desire to end things. Yes, I think it was very important for her daughter to receive vaccines \u2014 but it&#39;s not as if my wife would have changed her mind over a breakup fight.\n  I backed down and resolved to have that conversation in less confrontational terms when the opportunity arose.\n    My wife is one of the smartest, most sensible people I know. So what do smart, sensible people do when they perceive a threat? They do the smart, sensible thing: take precautions and warn others.\n    Again, it&#39;s easy to dismiss the worries of anti-vaxxers as irrational and chalk up their activism to paranoid behavior, but this misses a crucial point: The reasoning, once you accept the big, unsubstantiated premise, is valid. It isn&#39;t even  that far-fetched, if you don&#39;t think about it too hard: There are some heartbreaking precedents that feed this logic. Lead paint, tobacco, bloodletting \u2014 every time we feel the urge to reply, &#34;But vaccines are safe, everyone knows that,&#34; we ought to remember that the same sentence has been said, earnestly and confidently, about things that absolutely were hazardous.\n  Go tell arachnophobic parents that you must put spiders on their child because society depends on it, and see how that goes\n  If you&#39;ve come to believe that vaccines are dangerous, then anti-vax behavior follows almost rationally. If we want to reach these people, dismissing their logic as ridiculous or fringe is the worst strategy. It plays right into the anti-vaccination narrative: that they are the &#34;only sane ones,&#34; warning the careless masses about a very real and hidden danger.\n  My wife (and her family) sincerely believes that though her worries are being recognized as irrational, they aren&#39;t. It&#39;s easy to imagine how the very first person to notice the dangers of something ubiquitous, like lead, was dismissed by her peers as irrationally afraid \u2014 and to imagine you might be one of these people. The first anti-lead folks were called cranks \u2014 until they were proven right.\n  My point isn&#39;t that the anti-vaxxers might be right. They&#39;re not. My point is that once you believe something untrue, it&#39;s very easy to keep rationalizing that belief. It&#39;s very easy to dismiss your critics as shortsighted. And when you&#39;re constantly attacked, it&#39;s natural to make your resilience part of your identity, to become even more committed to maintaining it.\n  People are not essays, where you can go back to a previous paragraph and undermine the priors through careful, unperturbed dissection. People talk, and people balk. My wife would not stand to have me pick her apart like she is a problem that needs to be solved; her priors \u2014 like everyone else&#39;s \u2014 are part of her identity. All of us have beliefs of this sort; it&#39;s just that most of us can get away with them more easily. We need to stop seeing anti-vaxxers as people who can be persuaded to abandon a bad idea, and instead as people we&#39;re asking to abandon a part of themselves \u2014 people whose defensive sense of identity we&#39;ve encouraged with bad tactics.\n      A sense of identity isn&#39;t the only thing that makes anti-vaxxers impervious to confrontational argument. If you take a deeply controversial position, especially in the beginning, you won&#39;t last long without a strong support system. Unfortunately, fear sells \u2014 and there&#39;s always someone willing to give you that support for a price.\n  Evidently, people who don&#39;t trust or value conventional medicine still get sick. In Canada, where I live, socialized health care covers almost all conventional health-care costs, but there is a serious private market for people who would rather get their treatments from alternative sources. These alternative sources  can do some good: Sick people need care, and some amount of care is usually better than no care at all. But the alternative health industry is also a business, and at its worst, this is how the business works:  Articles about children turning &#34;autistic&#34; after a shot are circulated by authors selling books, websites selling ads, and merchants selling cures. When you&#39;re in the business of selling treatments against a subsidized competitor, your pitch needs to be emotive, essential. It needs to appeal to the values of your audience. Since there is a real economy hinging on people not trusting conventional medicine, its actors churn out sensationalist scare pieces by the truckload, which validates the preexisting anxieties of anti-vaxxers ad nauseam \u2014 and drive them into the arms of the people willing to sell them a solution.\n    Back when my wife and I were just friends, I met her sister a couple of times. She is a very pleasant, completely agreeable, and naturally sociable person. I really had no reason to be anything less than friendly to her. Then my wife told me that her sister is a naturopath who studied the toxic effects of vaccines &#34;extensively.&#34;\n  My sister-in-law is also a big part of my wife&#39;s support network. When my wife is second-guessing herself about vaccines \u2014 like when her daughter&#39;s father raised the issue after their separation \u2014 she turns to her sister. Her sister is even deeper in the movement that she is \u2014 she&#39;s a provider of alternative medicines by trade \u2014 and when they talk, my wife comes away more sure of the anti-vax worldview. Again: This isn&#39;t a strange behavior. How many times have you wondered about something important, only to be reassured by a conversation with a loved one?\n  Of course, it&#39;s not uniquely devious for anti-vaxxers to seek like-minded people to validate their views; we all do it. One of the reasons I like many of the newspapers and magazines I like, for instance, is because they tell me things I already think about foreign policy, urbanism, feminism, and race \u2014 we all suffer from confirmation bias to some extent. But unlike more ordinary biases, the alternative medicine racket is completely unchecked; by definition, it eschews mainstream checks on its theories and practices. It cashes in on encouraging the isolation and dependence of its participants. This is an environment in which every hypothesis is given equal weight, and all of them come packaged with some kind of product recommendation.\n  Without a profitable industry, anti-vax beliefs might not survive long. But again, what do we do? The monolithic media presence of the vaccination narrative gives skeptics an &#34;assaulted and oppressed&#34; outlook that encourages its members to seek out corners that coddle their worldviews. Those corners then sell them back their own biases \u2014 and they become even more confident that they&#39;re right.\n    I decided to write this piece after it was revealed that Pandemrix, a vaccine designed to combat swine flu, was causing narcolepsy in children. As Julia Belluz pointed out  on this site, the 2013 discovery was hardly covered by the media despite real and demonstrated side effects \u2014 precisely the kind of behavior anti-vaxxers suspect is happening with all vaccines.\n  I keep an eye out for stories like this, one that could allow my wife and me to discuss vaccination in nonconfrontational terms. A story like Pandemrix allowed me to engage her in good faith, to admit that sometimes medicine makes bad calls and that the media can be complicit. I brought it up to my wife to show that I care about her worries, that I don&#39;t think they are beyond the pale. When easing somebody&#39;s fears, love is rarely enough \u2014 empathy is needed, especially when you want to persuade. Refusing to engage in any open-minded discussion, to concede that things can go wrong, to admit that it&#39;s possible we don&#39;t know everything: That kind of condescension had gotten me nowhere with my wife and her daughter no closer to vaccinations. It hasn&#39;t gotten the broader fight against anti-vaxxers very far either.\n  When easing somebody&#39;s fears, love is rarely enough \u2014 empathy is needed, especially when you want to persuade\n  A lack of personal investment is, as it happens, what led to my wife&#39;s initial rejection of vaccines: She had a very unfortunate run-in with a complacent MD in her late teens, while she was going through a lot of pain physically and mentally.\n  It started with a drug-induced psychotic breakdown. She grew up in something of a broken home, with an absent father, an addict mother, and a violent stepfather \u2014 an environment where drugs were easy to come by and hard to ignore. At 17, she smoked something weird and felt herself quite literally losing it. Hallucinations. Panic attacks. Nausea and heart palpitations. After a grueling week of recovering from the episode, she did the normal thing and took herself to a doctor.\n  She got out with a prescription and an unshakable feeling that this doctor, and his clinic, and the government that paid for his services, did not care at all about her concerns, her needs, and her fears. That she was a problem that could be solved with a couple of pills. That the fear she had felt for her sanity was not respected, not even considered. That the solution to her drug problem was  more drugs.\n    This is not a breach of trust that can be restored by telling her vaccines are safe.\n  It&#39;s obvious and painful that all human systems are going to fail at some places due to human imperfection. It&#39;s probably impossible to force all doctors to be nice and considerate people.\n  Maybe my wife would have felt just as abandoned even if the doctor did everything right at that moment. But knowing that for many anti-vaxxers there is a root cause \u2014 something that led them to mistrust medicine and then wind up in a feedback loop that reinforced that mistrust \u2014 is vital to pushing back. I do think minds can be changed and hearts can be won, but I&#39;ve made my peace: Only love, patience, and empathy will make inroads. Treat anti-vaxxers kindly, if only because it&#39;s pretty hard to feel persecuted when your adversaries are being kind. This is the road I chose, and I am happy to share my life with a person who challenges and inspires me. Someone whom, a mere decade ago, I would have considered a dangerous lunatic.\n  And then, last week, her daughter asked if she would be getting shots this year.\n  &#34;Not with your classmates,&#34; my wife said. &#34;But yes, it&#39;s time. We&#39;ll schedule an appointment with our new family doctor.&#34;\n        First Person is Vox&#39;s home for compelling, provocative narrative essays. Do you have a story to share?

based corporates like ASML and Philips have been eyeing initiatives across Europe and applying what they\u2019ve learned to the region\u2019s strategy. Philips launched in Eindhoven in 1891 and played no small part in the municipality\u2019s ambitions to become a tech hub.\n Eindhoven produces a high number of patents per year considering its small population and has been home to an inordinate number of hardware startups. The local High Tech Campus has a high hardware focus, for instance.\n  Our survey respondents consider the city strong in areas like photonics, robotics, medical devices, materials science, deep tech, automotive tech, sustainability tech, medtech, Big Data, hardware and precision engineering. They are looking for more mature startups and scaleups focused on AI and hard tech.\n Eindhoven is considered weaker in fintech and consumer products, and it exists in a small region with limited global visibility.\n Over the next five years, one respondent said, \u201cEindhoven will have evolved to the Netherlands\u2019 second-largest tech ecosystem, behind Amsterdam. On a European scale, Eindhoven will have entered the top 10.\u201d\n     What industry sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by?

What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?\n High-tech systems and materials, the real high-tech and deep tech stuff that either leads to scientific breakthroughs or turns scientific breakthroughs into companies. Lithography makes a major contribution to that, as well as medical devices and production technologies.\n   What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city?

What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?\n The pros are high-tech systems, collaboration culture and excellent startup ecosystem; The cons are that it\u2019s a small region with limited visibility globally.\n   What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What\u2019s their focus?\n  With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out or will others move in?\n Others will move in! Housing is extremely expensive but the demand for a skilled workforce is extremely high. If people move to surrounding areas, within 30 km, housing prices skyrocket all over.\n Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc.)?\\\n  Where do you see your city\u2019s tech scene in five years\u2019 time?\n Leading worldwide in several technology areas, mainly, high-precision, roll-to-roll processing atomic layer deposition, material handling, industry 4.0, silicon processing equipment.\n  What industry sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?\n The region is strong in deep tech, automotive tech, sustainability tech, medtech, Big Data, hardware and precision engineering. Most excited by sustainability tech and deep tech. The region is weak in fintech.\n   What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What\u2019s their focus?\n Conservative, non-risk-taking \u2014 there are so many subsidies they don\u2019t need to take risks, so once the tech risk is gone, they are good, but they are not global enough; hardware.\n With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out or will others move in?\n Hardware is hands-on \u2014 people are still moving in!

What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?\n The region is strong in deep tech and health. I\u2019m excited about opportunities for cooperation between different companies. It\u2019s weak in seed investment.\n   What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What\u2019s their focus?\n  With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out or will others move in?\n They will stay; working from home has some benefits but meeting people in an inspiring environment gives the best synergy.\n Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc.)?\n  Where do you see your city\u2019s tech scene in five years\u2019 time?\n   What industry sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?\n The region is strong in building sustainable and resilient cities and a platform between cities/society and tech market.\n  Digital Toolbox (a Serendipity spinoff), Amber (mobility), Active Esports Arena and other portfolio companies of LUMO Labs.\n What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What\u2019s their focus?\n Through LUMO Labs, there is a focus on societal investments; the rest is investment in high tech due to the big industries (VDLK, ASML, NXP, Phillips).\n With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out or will others move in?\n  Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc.)?\n A combination of accelerators (LUMO Labs, HighTechXL, Braventure) and Brainport (ecosystem management) supported by the Eindhoven University of Technology and big corporates.\n Where do you see your city\u2019s tech scene in five years\u2019 time?\n Leading in the world on societal/systemic change \u2014 moving from high-tech toward impact (more software and digitization).\n  What industry sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in?

What is it weak in?\n It\u2019s strong in high-tech equipment, hardware, photonics, additive manufacturing, lighting, electronics, semiconductor technology and health tech, and weak in consumer products and apps.\n   What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What\u2019s their focus?\n  With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out or will others move in?\n They will stay. Eindhoven is a hot spot with many cultures, international tech community and great infrastructure, while it feels like a village.\n Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc.)?\n  Where do you see your city\u2019s tech scene in five years\u2019 time?\n   What industry sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?\n The Eindhoven ecosystem is really strong in the sectors of mobility, smart city and energy. I\u2019m most excited about smart city. This is our focus sector and it is the embodiment of ecosystem collaboration with impact solutions.\n   What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What\u2019s their focus?\n The investment scene is getting better. They are increasingly realizing that deep tech takes time and needs to be nurtured, but the potential impact is massive and can have a dramatic effect on the entire ecosystem. There are still relatively few early-stage impact drive investors. LUMO Labs is leading the pack on that front.\n With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out or will others move in?\n I think more people will stay as the need to move to Amsterdam as the tech hub of the Netherlands diminishes, giving Eindhoven a boost to strengthen its own ecosystem, which will in turn make even more people stay and attract people to move in the city. As a result, COVID-19 will have a positive effect on Eindhoven\u2019s tech ecosystem, I believe.\n Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc.)?\n  Where do you see your city\u2019s tech scene in five years\u2019 time?\n In five years, I believe Eindhoven will have evolved to Netherlands\u2019 second-largest tech ecosystem, behind Amsterdam.

It was started in 1858 by Brighton\u2019s Guardians more as a cost cutting exercise, than as an attempt to break a world record, but it did break a record and still remains as the deepest \u201cHAND DUG\u201d well in the world.\n Plans for a new workhouse  Back in 1858, plans were in hand to build a new workhouse at the top of what is now  Elm Grove and to add to it an industrial school for juveniles some 2 miles away at Warren Farm. The aim of the school would be to teach the misplaced youth of the town \u201cthe habits of industry\u201d and relieve them from \u201cthe bane of pauperism.\u201d\n The expense of pumped water  However, the expense of having pumped water supplied from the local waterworks, then on the corner of  Lewes Road (now Saunders Park) was considered prohibitive, so the Guardians decided that they would construct a single well for both properties and augment the workforce with labour from the  Dyke Road Workhouse. In their opinion, making relief for the more able pauper, young or old and regardless of gender, conditional on some of the destitute undertaking an aspect of the well\u2019s construction would reduce labour costs and indirectly add a further deterrent to anyone considering applying to the workhouse for poor relief.\n The initial plans were not successful  initial plan was to sink a 6 ft wide, brick lined shaft down some 400 feet to the subterranean water table. All the soil dug out would be placed in buckets and hand winched to a platform at the top of the shaft where it could be disposed of. After 2 years of digging, the shaft had only reached a depth of some 438 feet, but no water had been found. Fearing that they had just missed the supply, the contractor gave instructions for a lateral chamber to be driven some 30 ft northwards, but this too yeilded nothing. Further lateral tunnels were driven westwards and eastwards, but none of them were successful. Failing to acknowledge defeat, the Guardians sanctioned the construction of a further 4 ft wide shaft at the end of the eastern tunnel.\n Digging\u00a0done for 24 hours a day  Work continued for several more years with men working 24 hours a day just by candle light in appalling conditions. Many removed their clothes and worked naked for within the confines of a 4 ft circle teams of men had to dig, load buckets and lay bricks. Winchmen stood on tiny platforms cut into the side of the shaft, passing spoil up and bricks down as the shaft continued forever downwards. One winchman actually plunged to his death.\n Escalating costs caused concern  Above ground the Guardians began to bicker about the expense, for the Woodingdean Well was now costing the local ratepayer some \u00a390 a week and jests about it were frequent. Some said the town was constructing an alternative route to the Antipodes, whereas others described the whole thing as \u201ca great bore\u201d!\n The final break through  At the change of the evening shifts on Sunday 16th March 1862, the bricklayer noticed that the thin crust of earth he was standing on was being slowly pushed upwards like a giant piston. Scrambling up the numerous ladders to each winchman\u2019s platform, he and the others quickly vacated the shaft. It must have been a difficult task for the well had now been sunk to such an amazing depth their successful exit took some 45 minutes. Suddenly with a roar, the piston head crumbled and tools, buckets and ladders flooded up the shaft. Water had at last been found. It had taken over 4 years backbreaking work for a labour force which included many Brighton paupers, to hand dig a shaft some 1285 feet deep (850 of which were below sea level) without the aid of machines.\n An incredible achievement  To put this incredible achievement, distance and the danger into perspective, I can think of no greater analogy than that used in P Mercer &amp; D Holland\u2019s \u201cHunns Mere Pit\u201d which I have interpreted using my own illustration. The Woodingdean Well\u2019s depth into the earth was greater than the height of the Empire State Building. Imagine climbing that building in darkness on a twice daily basis, using just a series of rickety ladders, let alone in a panic situation with water flooding up beneath you and your colleagues!\n  I consent to my name and e-mail address being stored along with this comment, and to the website editors communicating with me by e-mail about the comment if necessary.

And if you take a look at commencement addresses from the past, you\u2019ll see a glimpse of what people in power told privileged young people to believe in and sketches of what the future could be, which we can now consider next to the reality of what came next. Lapham\u2019s Quarterly  is revisiting the history of giving advice to graduates and others in the process of acquiring knowledge or skills.\n  The Book of Ecclesiastes is one of the biblical \u201cwisdom\u201d books and belongs to an ancient literary tradition, beginning in Sumer and Babylonia, of recording the advice of sages. The word  Ecclesiastes derives from the Greek  ekklesiastes, or \u201cone who addresses an assembly,\u201d which is a rough translation of the Hebrew word  Qohelet (also  Koheleth), meaning \u201cpreacher\u201d or \u201cteacher.\u201d Qohelet is the name  given in the text by the apparent author of Ecclesiastes. He also claims to be a king of Jerusalem and the son of David. If that is his true parentage, Qohelet was King Solomon, the tenth-century-  ruler of the Israelites. Jewish and Christian theologians have traditionally followed this attribution by placing Ecclesiastes between the Song of Solomon and the Book of Proverbs, Solomon\u2019s other biblical writings, in the Old Testament. Yet the text\u2019s Aramaic loanwords suggest it was composed in the third century  , after Solomon\u2019s kingdom was divided and Jerusalem became one of the colonies of the Achaemenid Empire.\n Qohelet was a deeply cynical thinker, perhaps because of the diminished state of the Israelites. He describes a world in which success and happiness are not guaranteed, where an individual is largely powerless in the face of human greed, fallibility, and suffering. His advice for readers is to accept the futility of their lives and welcome the knowledge that all human actions are \u201cvanity\u201d or \u201cvapor.\u201d He suggests (perhaps influenced by the Greek philosophy of Epicureanism) that the best course of action is to pursue tranquility and pleasure:\n Therefore eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart. God has already given his approval to thy deeds. At all times be thy garments white, and let oil not be lacking for thy head. Enjoy life with the woman of thy love all the days of thy vain life that God has given thee under the sun. That is thy portion in life and the compensation for thy toil under the sun. Whatever thou can afford with thy substance do, for there is no activity, or reckoning, or knowledge, and no wisdom in Sheol.  1\n Since the first century, scholars have debated why Qohelet\u2019s pessimistic meditation on human life was included in the Bible. Morris Jastrow Jr., an expert on Semitic languages at the University of Pennsylvania, noted in his 1919 translation, \u201cIt is a strange book to have slipped into a sacred collection.\u201d Jastrow set out to produce a new translation of Qohelet\u2019s words, believing that centuries of adaptation and reframing had resulted in a different work than its creator had intended; he was determined to give twentieth-century readers a new impression of a very old text:\n In presenting Qohelet in a new garb, minus the trimmings which were attached to the original composition, it is my hope to make a remarkable literary production more intelligible than is possible by reading it in any of our present-day translations of the Old Testament, which are all modeled on the classic \u201cauthorized\u201d version of 1611, and which all assume the book to be a literary unit in its present form. In other words, I have tried to give the reader the book of Qohelet in its original form, as nearly as that is at present possible.\n Writers from  William Shakespeare to  Edith Wharton have paraphrased Qohelet\u2019s words, and  Leo Tolstoy turned to Ecclesiastes during a midlife crisis of faith, writing in   A Confession that his doubts began with a single realization: \u201cWhat am I?\u2014A part of the infinite. In those few words lies the whole problem.\u201d\n   What gain has a man of all his toil, \tWhich he toils under the sun? \tGeneration comes and generation goes, but the earth remains forever. \tThe sun rises and the sun sets, \tAnd to his rising place he returns. \tAround to the south and circling to the north, \tAround and around goes the wind, \tAnd on its circuits the wind returns. \tAll streams flow into the sea, \tBut the sea is not full. \tTo the place whither the streams flow, \tFrom there they flow back again. \tEverything is wearied, \tBeyond human utterance, \tBeyond sight and hearing. \tWhat has been is that which shall be; \tAnd what has happened is that which shall happen, \tSo that there is nothing new under the sun.\n If something occurs of which one says, \u201cSee, this is new\u201d\u2014ages before us it has already happened. Former occurrences are not recorded, and later occurrences also shall not be remembered by the ages that are to come.\n I, Qohelet, was king over Israel in Jerusalem, and I applied my mind to seek and explore everything under the sun\u2014a sorry business which God has given the children of men for their affliction. I saw all that happened under the sun\u2014and behold it was all vanity and chasing after wind.\n Now I thought to myself,  I have become great and acquired much more than anyone who reigned before me over Jerusalem. My mind was stored with very much wisdom and knowledge. So I set out to experience frivolity and foolishness, though I knew that this, too, was chasing after wind. I said to myself,  Come, I\u2019ll make a test of pleasure and of having a good time, but alas! This also turned out to be vanity. Of sport, I was led to conclude that it was madness, and of joy\u2014what does it accomplish! I made up my mind to stimulate my body with wine and to pursue folly, in order to ascertain whether this was a good way for the children of men to spend the days of their lives.\n I undertook great works. I acquired houses; I planted vineyards; I made gardens and parks. I planted in them all kinds of fruit trees, I made pools of water to irrigate the sprouting forest. I purchased slaves and handmaidens, and had a household of dependents, besides having possessions of cattle and flocks in large number, more than anyone before me in Jerusalem. I gathered also silver and gold, royal treasures, and provinces; I got singers and dancing maidens and all the delights of the children of men.\n So I became great, in excess of anyone who was before me in Jerusalem. I did not withhold anything that my eyes desired, I did not deny myself any pleasure, for I rejoiced in all my toil, and this was my portion of all my toil. But when I looked on all what my hands had wrought and on what I had toiled for\u2014all indeed seemed vanity and chasing after wind. Nothing seemed worthwhile under the sun.\n So I made a test of madness and folly, for what can any man do who comes after a king beyond what he has already done? And yet it seemed to me that perhaps wisdom  has an advantage over folly, insofar as light is better than darkness. But then I realized that there is one and the same fate for all, and I reflected that the fate of the fool will also overtake me. Why then should I be overwise? I concluded that this also is vanity. For of the wise man, as of the fool, there is no permanent record. In the days to come everything is forgotten. And see how the wise man dies just as the fool!\n So I hated life. All that happened under the sun seemed evil to me since all was vanity and chasing after wind. I hated that I must leave all that I had toiled for under the sun to one who comes after me. A man who toils with wisdom, knowledge, and integrity must hand it over as an inheritance to one who has not toiled for it\u2014surely this is vanity and a great evil. What has a man of all his toil and of his painstaking efforts under the sun, since all his days are pains and his ambition a vexation, with no rest for his mind even at night? Surely this is vanity.\n There is nothing better for a man than to eat and to drink and to enjoy himself for his toil; it seems to me that such is the will of God. Everything has its appointed time, and there is a time for every occurrence under the sun. There is a time to be born, and a time to die. There is a time for planting, and a time for uprooting. What profit, then, has the worker of his toil?\n I have observed every ambition which God has given the children of men for their affliction. He has given them a grasp of the whole world without the possibility on the part of man to fathom the work which God has made from the beginning to the end. I realized that there is nothing better for a man than to be happy and to enjoy himself in his life, and that every man who eats and drinks and has a good time in all his toil enjoys a gift of God. I realized that whatever God does is forever, to which one cannot add and from which one cannot take away. Whatever has been has been before, and what is to be has already been.\n I saw under the sun in the place of justice wickedness, and where the righteous should have been the wicked was. I reflected that God permits this in the case of children of men to test them and to show that they are beasts. For the fate of the children of men and the fate of the beast is the same. As this one dies, so is the death of that, and there is the same spirit to all. Man has no advantage over the beast, for all is vanity. All go to one place. All are of the dust and all return to dust. Who knows whether the spirit of the children of men mounts up and the spirit of the beast goes down? It appeared to me that there is nothing better for man than to enjoy himself. That is his portion\u2014who can help him to see what shall be after him?\n I considered all the oppressions practiced under the sun, and the tears of the oppressed without anyone to console them, and the violence of their oppressors with no comforter in sight! And I praised these long since dead more than those still living; better than both is the one who has not yet been, as he has not seen the evil happenings under the sun. I considered that all toil and all honest work is merely due to man\u2019s zeal against his neighbor\u2014surely this is vanity and chasing after wind. Better a handful in quiet than two handsful in toil and chasing after wind. And I further considered the vanity that there is under the sun. There is a single man without a mate, without a son or brother, yet toiling without end, and with an eye never satisfied by his wealth. For whom then should I toil and deprive myself of a good time? Surely this is vanity and a sorry business.\n Better is the child of humble birth and wise than an old king who is a fool and unable to take care of himself. For through a rebellion one may come to rule, even though one is born poor in one\u2019s own kingdom. I saw all the living under the sun flocking to the side of the child, who was to stand in his place. There was no end to all the people, yet those that come after will not rejoice in him\u2014now surely this is vanity and chasing after wind.\n Observe thy pilgrimages to the house of God but draw nigh to hear, rather than to have fools offer a sacrifice, for they do not know enough to do any harm. Be not rash with thy mouth, and be not led hastily to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven and thou art upon earth. Therefore, let thy words be few. If thou  does make a vow to God, do not defer paying it. Whatever thou vows, pay! It is better not to vow than to vow and not pay. Let not thy mouth bring sin upon thee, and do not say before God that it was a slip. Why arouse God\u2019s anger and destroy thy own handiwork?\n A multitude of dreams results in many foolish words, for a dream comes through too much business, and a fool\u2019s voice is heard in many words. If thou sees the oppression of the poor, and justice and righteousness in the country defrauded, do not be amazed at the occurrence, for there is some \u201cguardian\u201d higher up and still higher ones above this one, and overtopping them all is the king.\n  A sore evil that I have seen under the sun is riches hoarded by the owner, and when that fortune is lost through a bad venture, the son begotten by him has nothing. He cannot carry anything that he has acquired by his toil away with him. Surely this  is a sore evil, that just as he came, so he goes. Therefore, what profit is it to him that he toils for the wind and that he spends all his days in saving and in constant worry and sickness and distress?\n It seems to me the thing that is good and proper is to eat, drink, and to have a good time with all one\u2019s toil under the sun during the span of life which God has allotted to one, for that is his portion. Every man to whom God has given riches and possessions and who has the power to enjoy it and to take his portion and to be happy in his toil\u2014this is a gift of God. For he should remember that life is short and that God approves of joy.\n There is an evil I have observed under the sun and it bears heavily on mankind\u2014a man to whom God has given riches and possessions and superfluity with nothing lacking of anything that he might wish for, but to whom God has not given the power to enjoy it, so that a stranger enjoys it\u2014this surely is vanity and a sore evil.\n If a man begets a hundred children and lives many years, be his life ever so long, and he does not get his fill of joy out of it\u2014I say that the abortion is happier than he. Even though it comes into vanity, moves in darkness, and with darkness its name is covered and it has never seen the sun nor has known anything\u2014yet this is preferable to the other. And though a man lives a thousand years twice told and has not had a good time\u2014do not all go to one place?\n What advantage has a wise man over a fool, or the poor man who by his knowledge sets an example to the living? Better is enjoyment than longing\u2014though this also is vanity and chasing after wind.\n Whatever is has long since been determined and what is has been fixed. Man cannot contend with what is stronger than himself. Since many possessions merely increase vanity, what advantage are they to man? For who knows what is good for a man during the span of his life of vanity? And though he spends his life like a shadow, is there anyone who can tell man who is to be after him under the sun?\n  1 Sheol is the Hebrew underworld, described in the Bible as \u201cthe land of gloom and deep darkness\u201d (Job 10:21).  \u21a9\n  Read the other entries in our series:  Lewis H.

Tech companies now rely on it to categorize people and measure whether products such as facial recognition systems or smartwatch heart-rate sensors perform equally well across skin tones.   read more\n  Critics say FST, which includes four categories for &#34;white&#34; skin and one apiece for &#34;black&#34; and &#34;brown,&#34; disregards diversity among people of color. Researchers at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, during  a federal technology standards conference last October, recommended abandoning FST for evaluating facial recognition because it poorly represents color range in diverse populations.\n In response to Reuters&#39; questions about FST, Google, for the first time and ahead of peers, said that it has been quietly pursuing better measures.\n &#34;We are working on alternative, more inclusive, measures that could be useful in the development of our products, and will collaborate with scientific and medical experts, as well as groups working with communities of color,&#34; the company said, declining to offer details on the effort.\n The controversy is part of a larger reckoning over racism and diversity in the tech industry, where the workforce is more white than in sectors like finance. Ensuring technology works well for all skin colors, as well different ages and genders, is assuming greater importance as new products, often powered by artificial intelligence (AI), extend into sensitive and regulated areas such as healthcare and law enforcement.\n Companies know their products can be faulty for groups that are under-represented in research and testing data. The concern over FST is that its limited scale for darker skin could lead to technology that, for instance, works for golden brown skin but fails for espresso red tones.\n Numerous types of products offer palettes far richer than FST. Crayola last year launched 24 skin tone crayons, and Mattel Inc&#39;s  (MAT.O) Barbie Fashionistas dolls this year cover nine tones.\n The issue is far from academic for Google. When the company announced in February that cameras on some Android phones could measure pulse rates via a fingertip,  it said readings on average would err by 1.8% regardless of whether users had light or dark skin.\n The company later gave  similar warranties that skin type would not noticeably affect results of a feature for filtering backgrounds on Meet video conferences, nor of an upcoming web tool for identifying skin conditions, informally dubbed  Derm Assist.\n    The late Harvard University dermatologist Dr.  Thomas Fitzpatrick invented the scale to personalize ultraviolet radiation treatment for psoriasis, an itchy skin condition. He grouped the skin of &#34;white&#34; people as Roman numerals I to IV by asking how much sunburn or tan they developed after certain periods in sun.\n A decade later came type V for &#34;brown&#34; skin and VI for &#34;black.&#34; The scale is still part of U.S. regulations for testing sunblock products, and it remains a popular dermatology standard for assessing patients&#39; cancer risk and more.\n Some dermatologists say the scale is a poor and overused measure for care, and often conflated with race and ethnicity.\n &#34;Many people would assume I am skin type V, which rarely to never burns, but I burn,&#34; said Dr. Susan Taylor, a University of Pennsylvania dermatologist who founded Skin of Color Society in 2004 to promote research on marginalized communities. &#34;To look at my skin hue and say I am type V does me disservice.&#34;\n Technology companies, until recently, were unconcerned. Unicode, an industry association overseeing emojis, referred to FST in 2014 as its basis for adopting five skin tones beyond yellow,  saying the scale was &#34;without negative associations.&#34;\n A 2018 study titled  &#34;Gender Shades,&#34; which found facial analysis systems more often misgendered people with darker skin, popularized using FST for evaluating AI. The research described FST as a &#34;starting point,&#34; but scientists of similar studies that came later told Reuters they used the scale to stay consistent.\n &#34;As a first measure for a relatively immature market, it serves its purpose to help us identify red flags,&#34; said Inioluwa Deborah Raji, a Mozilla fellow focused on auditing AI.\n In  an April study testing AI for detecting deepfakes, Facebook Inc  (FB.O) researchers wrote FST &#34;clearly does not encompass the diversity within brown and black skin tones.&#34; Still, they released videos of 3,000 individuals to be used for evaluating AI systems, with FST tags attached based on the assessments of eight human raters.\n The judgment of the raters is central. Facial recognition software startup AnyVision last year gave  celebrity examples to raters: former baseball great Derek Jeter as a type IV, model Tyra Banks a V and rapper 50 Cent a VI.\n AnyVision told Reuters it agreed with Google&#39;s decision to revisit use of FST, and Facebook said it is open to better measures.\n Microsoft Corp  (MSFT.O) and smartwatch makers Apple Inc  (AAPL.O) and Garmin Ltd  (GRMN.O) reference FST when working on health-related sensors.\n But use of FST could be fueling &#34;false assurances&#34; about heart rate readings from smartwatches on darker skin, University of California San Diego clinicians, inspired by the Black Lives Matter social equality movement,  wrote in the journal Sleep last year.\n Microsoft acknowledged FST&#39;s imperfections.

They dehydrate very quickly.\u201d\n  His wife received an alert on her phone soon after that. The family said their thermostat had been changed remotely, raising the temperature of their home during a three-hour \u201cenergy saving event.\u201d\n  The family\u2019s smart thermostat was installed a few years ago as part of a new home security package. Many smart thermostats can be enrolled in a program called &#34;Smart Savers Texas.&#34; It&#39;s operated by a company called  EnergyHub.\n  The agreement states that in exchange for an entry into sweepstakes, electric customers allow them to control their thermostats during periods of high energy demand. EnergyHub\u2019s list of its clients include TXU Energy, CenterPoint and ERCOT.\n    \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want anybody else controlling my things for me,\u201d he said.\n  A scroll through a Houston Reddit board shows English is not alone. Several others said they found out during this week\u2019s heatwave that their thermostats were being accessed, and turned up, remotely.\n    English said his smart thermostat is convenient but said it\u2019s not worth it.\n  \u201cIf somebody else can manipulate this, I\u2019m not for it,\u201d he said.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 12:39:54", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name":

a face in the rock, like the Old Man on the Mountain famously minted on the New Hampshire quarter? Or perhaps you have seen clouds in the shape of dragons, or the face of Jesus on a piece of burnt toast? If so, you have experienced what psychologists call &#34; pareidolia&#34; \u2014\u00a0finding meaningful images in visual patterns.\n And while the experience of pareidolia is universal, few know that pareidolia is also an indication of\u00a0 creativity\u00a0and a fundamental feature of aesthetic appreciation. Recent scientific research into the neuroscience of &#34;spontaneous thought&#34; suggests that the source of pareidolia may be one of the reasons we love art and nature so much.\n Cognitive fluctuations are unpredictable changes in neural activity in the brain. \u00a0Their causes are presently unknown. Neuroscientists have been aware of these fluctuations since the 1930s, but typically averaged them out as &#34;background noise&#34; from other brain activity correlated to conscious thought.\n Recently, scientists have come to believe that so-called background noise in the brain may be more crucial to consciousness than previously thought. Recent research found that these fluctuations make up 95% of brain activity; conscious thoughts account for merely 5%. Cognitive fluctuations are like the dark matter or &#34;junk&#34; DNA of the brain, in that they make up the most significant part of what&#39;s happening but remain mysterious.\n Neuroscientists such as\u00a0 Georg Northoff,\u00a0 Robin Carhart-Harris, and\u00a0 Stanislas Dehaene\u00a0have been focusing their research on these fluctuations in the last fifteen years. They have concluded that neural fluctuations are not secondary, but fundamental for consciousness. Using technologies that measure the frequency and strength of large groups of neural fluctuations in the brain, scientists have discovered that brain waves tend to nest into one another, like syncopation in music. At the lowest frequencies, the drums lay down a beat, and the bass plays a rhythm. In between the notes of that rhythm, the guitar plays a melody. The song of consciousness builds up from spontaneous neural fluctuations.\n There are similar spontaneous fluctuations in the world, our bodies, and our brains. When sensory information from the world interacts with the brain, it creates unique &#34;diffractive&#34; patterns, similar to the colliding waves made by stones dropped into a pool of water. The world pulses with frequencies of sound and light like a drumbeat within which our bodies digest food, beat hearts, and pump lungs.\n Our brains do not represent the world, but rather respond to this stimuli with their own spontaneous fluctuations. They play between the waves with melodies that make up our thoughts and feelings. Like a jazz trio, the world, body, and brain have their own spontaneous fluctuations that are the basis of the creative improvisation we call reality.\n These fluctuations are also the source of our experience of\u00a0 pareidolia. When we let our minds wander and daydream, they become increasingly open to these divergent &#34;bottom-up&#34; diffractions and weak associations. Pareidolia occurs when our brains involuntarily experiment with seeing various &#34;top-down&#34; images such as animal shapes or faces in these fluctuations. In this improvisational state of mind, spontaneous thoughts and creative images rise like waves from the ocean of the unconscious and disappear\u00a0 again. This back-and-forth is an improvisational process that increases cognitive fluctuations in the brain and has\u00a0 therapeutic\u00a0effects similar to other\u00a0 activities\u00a0that increase\u00a0 cognitive flux.\n But why do we enjoy this state of being so much? Why do we prefer some plants, or some works of art, over others? Some sights and sounds tend to amplify these spontaneous fluctuations and others do not. For instance, scientists have shown that taking a walk outdoors tends to increase mind-wandering due to certain\u00a0 patterns\u00a0in nature called fractals. The same thing happens when we view these patterns and proportions in\u00a0 art. A fractal is a particular repeating coarse-grained to fine-grain pattern, such as a tree whose forking patterns  repeat in its branches, twigs, and leaf veins.\n When we look at the world, our unconscious eye movements or &#34;eye saccades&#34; also have a fractal pattern as they move over\u00a0 images. When we view fractal patterns with our fractal eye movements, our bodies become\u00a0 less stressed, and we mind-wander more as images emerge and disappear from conscious awareness. Even our brainwaves become more fractal and more interconnected when our minds\u00a0 wander. And this experience of reverie tends to feel good.\n  Want more health and science stories in your inbox? Subscribe to Salon&#39;s weekly newsletter  The Vulgar Scientist.\n  For instance, several recent studies have shown that people prefer to look at fractal patterns and artworks more than non-fractal ones and find them more aesthetically\u00a0 beautiful. Fractal images and sounds invite our eyes, bodies, and brains to play, wander, and make new associations at a mainly unconscious and involuntary level. We enjoy it even if when we do not consciously know why.\n As you might guess, fractals also increase pareidolia. Studies show that people tend to see more images in Rorschach ink-blot tests with a particular fractal\u00a0 dimension.\n But why is the play between body, brain, and world so widely experienced as pleasurable and beautiful? The physicist, Richard Taylor at the University of Oregon, speculates that humans are &#34;wired&#34; with a &#34; fractal fluency&#34; because we evolved surrounded by the natural fractal patterns of plants, clouds, and rocks. Studies confirm that fractals increase attention, pattern recognition, navigation, reduce stress, and have aesthetic appeal. Taylor argues fractals are also the source of our &#34;biophilia,&#34; or love of nature.\n What I find fascinating about the interrelation between cognitive fluctuations, mind wandering, and fractal patterns in art and nature is that they tend to be good for us in a uniquely\u00a0 playful\u00a0way. Nature does not dictate a single universal form of right action, healthy living, or beautiful art. Instead, some patterns let us play and experiment more or less. And it seems that our bodies prefer to play.\n But play can also be dangerous. Not all our experiments work, and some go wrong. Mind-wandering can lead to negative rumination, and not everyone prefers the same fractal aesthetics.\n But here is the takeaway: we are not biologically programmed to like or this or that object, but rather inclined to enjoy the process of play, improvisation, trial, and error in all things. In other words, recent research into mind wandering and fractals suggests that the process of creativity and unconscious play involved in making and experiencing art is a crucial source of aesthetic beauty and our love of nature.\n       Thomas Nail is Professor of Philosophy at the  University of Denver and author of numerous books and articles, some of which\u00a0can be read online\u00a0 here.

2000s, people think they know the story of Paris Hilton. So, when the 40-year-old released a YouTube documentary about her life last year, many were shocked to learn about her decades-long struggle with trauma.\n Hilton tearfully recounted how she was woken up by strangers in her bedroom in the middle of the night as a teenager and forcibly taken across the country. She said her unanswered cries for help repeatedly play out in nightmares which make it difficult to sleep.\n Her story, though shocking, is not unique. Hilton is one of thousands of American children sent every year by their parents into a private network of &#34;tough love&#34; residential programmes and schools marketed at reforming their behaviour.\n   &#34;My parents got me kidnapped and dropped off in the middle of the mountains,&#34; 21-year-old Daniel says in a TikTok video watched more than a million times.\n As a teenager, Daniel suffered anxiety and depression. He was 15 and had recently come out as gay when he self-harmed so severely that he required hospital care. It was in hospital that he was shaken awake in the middle of the night by two men. They told him the process could be easy or hard - depending on how much he resisted. With little fight left in him, Daniel went with the pair. But when he asked a stranger if he could use a telephone to call his parents on a brief stop for food, he says the escorts threatened him with handcuffs.\n  Daniel was sent to a wilderness programme in Utah where he spent 77 days living outdoors, hiking miles a day on rations. He vividly remembers feeling cold, hungry and dirty for weeks on end and witnessing others attempt to run away and try to take their own lives. Like many others sent to wilderness programmes, he was then enrolled directly into a long-term facility - this time in Montana - where he would spend another 15 months.\n  The Troubled Teen Industry (TTI) has become an umbrella term for a wide scope of private residential programmes like these aimed at modifying adolescent behaviour. From boot camps to boarding schools, these facilities are marketed as treatment for a broad range of behavioural and mental health issues including eating disorders, drug use and defiance.\n The people who took Hilton and Daniel were from companies specially marketed to families concerned about how their children might react to being enrolled in a programme. These youth transportation services are well-advertised and often come recommended, with parents typically paying a few thousand dollars to have their children taken from their beds and securely dropped off across the country.\n Parents are sometimes referred to the industry by third parties after feeling they have exhausted other means of getting their children help. Programmes sell themselves on high levels of anecdotal success, with testimonials from families and students on their marketing materials and in online reviews describing them as transformative and even life-saving.\n But for years, other former residents have been painting a very different picture of their time within these facilities, including in lawsuits and criminal complaints, alleging emotional and physical abuse.\n  The BBC has spoken to 20 people who identify as troubled teen survivors, aged from 20 to their late 40s, about their experiences within the industry over the last few decades.\n  Although their individual backgrounds and reasons for being sent away differ, patterns emerge across their accounts and the hundreds more shared in TTI survivor support networks online.\n The size of the industry and its yearly turnover of teenagers across the US remains elusive because there is no federal regulator monitoring it.\n   The US Government Accountability Office was tasked with investigating allegations of neglect and abuse across the industry in 2007, but found it difficult to grasp the national picture due to irregular licensing rules at the state level and ambiguity surrounding the labels facilities use to describe themselves - like boot camps or therapeutic boarding schools.\n Their investigators found thousands of allegations of abuse and examined a number of deaths at behavioural programmes across the US and in American-owned businesses operating abroad. Their reports raised concerns about the level of training required of staff as well as what they described as deceptive and questionable marketing practices aimed at parents.\n  Cynthia Clark Harvey was one of them. Her daughter Erica was just 15 when she died of heatstroke and dehydration on her first full day in a wilderness programme in Nevada in 2002.\n  Cynthia remembers her daughter as a bright, thoughtful and athletic young girl who had always done well academically until she began suffering from mental health problems aged 14. Her struggles led her to become suicidal and begin experimenting with illegal drugs. When Erica was admitted to hospital and excluded from school, the family felt frightened and out of their depth.\n   At the time, the situation felt drastic. Erica had been doing better but her psychiatrist recommended that residential treatment could help her path to recovery.\n The programme her family chose was well-known and accredited. They felt reassured Erica was in safe hands and would grow from the experience. After weeks of deliberation and planning, they travelled to Nevada under the guise of a family trip with her younger sister. When the deception was revealed, Erica became scared and angry and refused to get out of the car. After a turbulent hours-long group therapy session with other families, she and the other children were taken away.\n This was the last time Cynthia and her husband ever saw their daughter alive. By the time they got back home to Arizona the following evening, there was already a message waiting on their answering phone telling them to call. They were told Erica had an accident and staff were performing CPR.\n &#34;I don&#39;t remember the time frame, but at that point she probably had been dead already for quite some time,&#34; Cynthia says.\n   Erica&#39;s obituary could only say that she died hiking in Nevada. Her parents would not find out her cause of death for weeks - and it took years and a lawsuit for them to get records and find out the truth of what happened that day.\n Cynthia says they eventually settled with the programme for an undisclosed amount on the condition they could speak freely about the circumstances of their daughter&#39;s death. She learned Erica had been pushed to keep hiking as her condition worsened throughout the day. She later testified to Congress about how her daughter&#39;s distress had been mistaken for teenage belligerence by staff. Even after Erica fell off the trail into brush and rocks, she did not receive medical help for almost an hour.\n The remote location of the trek and a series of blunders in calling help to their location meant it took hours more for an emergency helicopter to arrive and take her to hospital where she was officially declared dead, long past the point her life could have been saved.\n Cynthia continues to grapple with regret and grief over what happened and came to connect with other parents who found themselves in the same unimaginable position. No criminal charges were ever filed over her daughter&#39;s death but 19 years on, Cynthia continues to speak publicly in favour of industry-wide reform.\n The National Association of Therapeutic Schools and Programs (Natsap) - the largest membership association of its kind - appeared on behalf of the industry in the congressional hearings, where it was grilled by lawmakers about the protections and checks in place.\n Natsap&#39;s website today says it and the industry have changed over time. It emphasises that it has ethical standards in place and requires members to be licensed by their appropriate state agency or a national accrediting body and have therapeutic services overseen by a qualified clinician, though it does not accredit facilities themselves.\n Campaigners argue that current levels of oversight are not enough. They say the lack of cohesive national monitoring has allowed bad actors to move around the industry and can enable facilities to rebrand under new names and distance themselves from complaints.\n In online networks they have built, people who identify as survivors of the industry connect and offer support across the country - pooling information and resources to track alleged abuses and a revolving door of programmes and staff. One Reddit forum on the topic has more than 20,000 members alone.\n   While a number of the more controversial programmes and organisations have closed down in recent years, allegations continue to plague the industry. A lot of the stories and experiences former residents recounted to the BBC had a lot in common - whether they got out decades ago or within the last couple of years.\n Many described arrival processes that left them feeling degraded and dehumanised. Those taken by transport companies described the process as disorienting and frightening. Some, including sex abuse victims, complained of invasive strip searches and examinations. One person, who was sent due to struggles with depression stemming from gender dysphoria, recounted undergoing a smear test as a virgin aged 14. Others described having their heads shaved and having blood and drugs testing despite having no history of substance abuse themselves.\n   Some claim to have witnessed and experienced practices like isolation and restraint and say they were also expected to punish and restrain others. Many of the systems they described were based on levels where active participation, including in &#34;attack therapy&#34; sessions where group members are expected to confront and criticise one another, was required to progress and gain basic privileges. Others described arbitrary physical labour, collective punishments and periods of mandated silence which could last weeks.\n They all described repressive environments with extreme limits and censorship of their contact with the outside world. Many believe their parents were misled about the reality of the programmes they enrolled them in, and describe rules that seeded mistrust between them and their families. Some recounted ongoing damage to relationships and enduring fears of opening up about their experiences, even after leaving, for fear of being sent back or not being believed.\n Some told the BBC they witnessed physical violence, self-harm and suicide attempts and many know other residents who took their own lives after leaving. Others have subsequently been diagnosed with conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder and say they continue to suffer long-term social difficulties, including in trusting in others, because of their experience.\n  In 2006, journalist Maia Szalavitz wrote a book that urged parents to seek evidence-based treatment for children instead of resorting to behavioural modification facilities. Her book traces the origins of many of the methods used in the industry, including confrontational group therapy, to controversial and discredited programmes from decades ago.\n Advocates for change say the teenage &#34;tough love&#34; industry, which first began to take off in the 1980s, has been able to endure decades of controversy in part because of social stigma surrounding the issues why parents seek help. It is not uncommon for teenagers to spend years within the system and monthly tuition, sometimes in the thousands, can mount up fast.\n Many, including Szalavitz, believe those referring families can exploit or exaggerate fears children will end up dead or incarcerated because of issues like drug abuse. Both her and Dr Kate Truitt, a clinical psychologist and neuroscientist who works with former residents, say the trauma experienced at these facilities can actually perpetuate or lead to long-term battles with addiction and abusive relationships.\n Many ex-residents, including some the BBC spoke to, say they initially viewed their treatment as justified and even advocated for others to send their children. Some took years to change their opinion of their programme after they reflected on their experiences.\n   Dr Truitt compares the trauma she has seen in some former residents to that experienced by former members of cults or prisoners of war. She points out that their experiences can be particularly damaging as adolescence is such a critical time for development.\n &#34;And because of the type of specific trauma they&#39;ve endured, most survivors don&#39;t feel safe seeking out treatment, because the people who were the treatment providers are the perpetrators,&#34; she tells the BBC.\n  Paris Hilton revealed she had already run away from a number of other placements before she was taken to Provo Canyon in Utah and kept for almost a year before she turned 18.\n The documentary This is Paris shows her reuniting with classmates as they go public with their ongoing trauma from alleged experiences of emotional and physical abuse there, including allegations of punishments like solitary confinement.\n  Provo Canyon remains open. A statement pinned to the top of their website says it was sold to new owners in 2000 and it cannot comment on operations or patient experiences before this time. They also say they do not use methods like seclusion or mechanical restraint now.\n Hilton&#39;s documentary has been watched almost 30 million times and she has continued vocal advocacy since its release.\n This role marks a drastic departure from the persona she built her celebrity brand and business empire around. Although her teenage history was already known among those who went through the same systems, they say having someone as high-profile come forward has helped bring credibility and awareness to the issue.\n People within the community say the documentary has empowered some to speak out about their experience for the first time. or has been used to help others, including parents, understand what they went through.\n   Some former residents have united under the idea of #BreakingCodeSilence, in reference to the periods of mandated social isolation used as a punishment and as a method of control in some facilities.\n &#34;One of the rules in many of these programmes is that you couldn&#39;t take anyone&#39;s phone number or name when you left. So, we were never meant to connect,&#34; Katherine McNamara, who went to Provo with Hilton, says about the groups that have emerged on social media. She and some others are now working together on a non-profit to help raise awareness, support those who identify as survivors and advocate for change.\n Other celebrities, including Paris Jackson and tattoo artist Kat von D, have been inspired by the documentary to come forward.\n Rapper Bhad Bhabie, real name Danielle Bregoli, has called for television personality Dr Phil to apologise for sending her and other teenagers to troubled teen facilities on his popular US show.\n It came after another former guest filed a lawsuit alleging she had been punished for reporting an alleged sexual assault by a staff member at the same therapeutic boarding ranch Bregoli was sent to. The facility, which the BBC contacted for a response, has previously denied the allegations against it and disputed their accounts.\n Phil McGraw said in an interview he was sad to hear of Bregoli&#39;s alleged bad experience but distanced himself and his show from her claims.\n  Younger people, once isolated from their teenage peers because of their experience, are using social media to try and break the stigma. Some have gained huge followings on platforms like TikTok from telling their stories. But none of this is not without personal risk - the BBC has seen legal letters sent to one content creator after they spoke publicly.\n Daniel has gained more than 240,000 followers and millions of likes since he started telling his and other people&#39;s stories last year. He now gets dozens of messages every day from others who went through similar situations and has had parents contact him to say they&#39;ve reconsidered plans to send their children away after seeing his videos.\n &#34;If my 15-year-old self knew that people were out there fighting for me, I would have felt so relieved,&#34; he says about the movement.\n  In some cases, social media has been a tool for tangible change. One woman, Amanda Householder, used TikTok to spread awareness of allegations surrounding her parents&#39; treatment of girls at a religious boarding ranch they were running in Missouri. Millions viewed her videos and eventually officials closed the school.\n   Householder testified to end religious exemptions in the state of Missouri that stopped even basic oversight of conditions at private religious facilities like the one her parents ran. She described the experience to the BBC as &#34;very cathartic\u2026 knowing that maybe in the future kids won&#39;t have to go through what we went through&#34; and says she hopes to give evidence in their criminal case.\n Hilton was part of a group who spoke at a hearing to convince lawmakers to introduce better protections in Utah - the state thought to have the biggest density of troubled teen facilities in the US.\n &#34;I don&#39;t know if my nightmares will ever go away, but I do know that there are hundreds of thousands of kids going through this, and maybe if I stop their nightmares, it will help me stop mine,&#34; she testified.\n    But a spokesperson for Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff&#39;s office confirmed to the BBC that he is working to update and re-introduce legislation aimed at prohibiting and ending abuse at residential treatment centres and increasing national oversight of such facilities.\n   &#34;It doesn&#39;t get better as the years go on, because it&#39;s just more milestones that go by,&#34; Cynthia reflects.\n It&#39;s been well over a decade since she took part in hearings pushing for federal regulation. But against all odds, she remains hopeful.\n Cynthia has been emboldened by the momentum building over the last year as more and more have come forward.\n &#34;When I first started doing my work after Erica&#39;s death, there were survivors out there, but they were not being listened to. And now they&#39;re starting to get listened to.&#34;\n Images of Paris Hilton taken by Kevin Ostajewski. Other images were supplied and Getty Stock.
