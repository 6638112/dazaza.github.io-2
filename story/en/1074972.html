Over the past decade, I&#39;ve had the privilege to both attend and work at some of the  best universities in Ohio and the world.</p><p>2007年，我高中毕业，不知道如何实现我的大学理想。在过去的十年里，我&#39；I’我有幸在俄亥俄州和世界上最好的大学上学和工作。</p><p>  Here’s a quick list of the institutions I’ve taken part in:</p><p>以下是我参加过的机构的简要列表：</p><p>    That being said, I made a lot of mistakes along the way. I acquired unnecessary student loan debt. I took courses out of sequence. I transferred colleges and changed my major more times than I’d care to admit.</p><p>尽管如此，我还是犯了很多错误。我欠了不必要的学生贷款。我不按顺序上课。我转学大学，换专业的次数比我愿意承认的还要多。</p><p>  What all of these experiences taught me is that there is a better way to do college. It is possible to complete a college degree for  pennies on the dollar when done creatively.</p><p>所有这些经历告诉我的是，有更好的方式上大学。创造性地完成一个大学学位是有可能的。</p><p>          Continue on for your 2+ years masters or professional degree in the same school or one recommended by your faculty</p><p>继续在同一所学校攻读2年以上的硕士学位或专业学位，或获得教员推荐的学位</p><p>    Live happily ever after (with an average  $949 monthly student loan repayment for the next 10 years and no work experience after 6+ years of schooling)</p><p>从此过上幸福的生活（未来10年每月平均偿还949美元的学生贷款，6年以上的学校教育后没有工作经验）</p><p>  This article is the resource I wish I had found in my senior year of high school or first few years of college. If you follow the advice and use the resources linked throughout, you ( or your child, friend, sibling, etc.) will save years of your life and tens of thousands of dollars.</p><p>这篇文章是我希望在高中四年级或大学前几年找到的资源。如果你听从建议，使用贯穿始终的资源，你（或你的孩子、朋友、兄弟姐妹等）将节省你的生命年数和数万美元。</p><p>        The first section deals with  “classic” ways of getting your college degree cheaper and faster than the traditional route. If you are familiar with the college environment, then you will likely already know about some of these.</p><p>第一部分介绍了比传统方式更便宜、更快获得大学学位的“经典”方法。如果你熟悉大学环境，那么你可能已经知道其中的一些。</p><p>    The second section deals with  “experimental” ways of getting a college credential. All of these are fully accredited and legitimate. But, because they push the boundaries, they will not be right for every student.</p><p>第二部分讨论获得大学文凭的“实验性”方法。所有这些都是完全认可和合法的。但是，因为它们突破了界限，它们并不适合每个学生。</p><p>        Also note, this post is geared towards students looking to go to  college in Ohio (or live in Ohio and want to take advantage of accredited online options). I know that other states are working on innovative options ( both California and New York are doing interesting work in the space). But as an Ohio-native, I wanted to help other Midwesterners take advantage of the uniquely robust universities ( all 97+) we have right in our backyard.</p><p>还要注意的是，这篇文章面向那些希望在俄亥俄州上大学（或者住在俄亥俄州，希望利用经认证的在线选项）的学生。我知道其他州正在研究创新方案（加利福尼亚州和纽约州都在这一领域做着有趣的工作）。但作为一名俄亥俄州人，我想帮助其他中西部人利用我们后院独特的强大大学（所有97+大学）。</p><p>              The first college I went to, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), charges $2,186 per credit hour. That&#39;s roughly $6,600 per course. The community college down the street from where I lived, who, by the way, had a transfer agreement with every local 4-year university (including CWRU), which would have made transferring credits a breeze, charges $114.54 per credit (or $340 per course).</p><p>我上的第一所大学是凯斯西储大学（CWRU），每学时收费2186美元。那&#39；每道菜大约6600美元。我住的那条街上的社区学院，顺便说一句，它与当地的每一所四年制大学（包括CWRU）都有一份转学协议，这将使转学学分变得轻而易举，每个学分收费114.54美元（或每门课程340美元）。</p><p>  In this example, the  cost-savings of doing your first 2 years at a community college and then transferring to a 4-year university is approximately  $124,287.60. No, that’s not a typo. The decision would save you the equivalent of a small family home.</p><p>在本例中，在社区学院学习前2年，然后转学到4年制大学的成本节约约为124287.60美元。不，那不是打字错误。这个决定将为你节省相当于一个小家庭的房子。</p><p>  Community college is the first recommendation I make to every college-seeking person. It’s affordable, efficient, easily transferable, and  loaded with benefits. Plus, they often have excellent relationships with local employers.</p><p>社区大学是我向每一个想上大学的人提出的第一个建议。它价格合理、效率高、易于转让，并带来诸多好处。此外，他们通常与当地雇主关系良好。</p><p>  One of the reasons they can pass on such significant savings is because they are an  academically-focused entity. Most community colleges don&#39;t have dorms, elaborate dining halls, or sports teams. They focus solely on the education piece. Plus, their state funding relies on them helping their students graduate and find suitable employment. If more 4-year universities were on the hook for their students&#39; success, we&#39;d likely see their priorities shifting.</p><p>他们之所以能将如此可观的储蓄转嫁出去，其中一个原因是他们是一个以学术为中心的实体。大多数社区大学没有&#39；我们没有宿舍、精致的餐厅或运动队。他们只关注教育内容。此外，他们的国家资金依赖于帮助学生毕业和找到合适的工作。如果有更多的四年制大学为他们的学生着想#39；成功，我们&#39；我可能会看到他们的优先事项发生变化。</p><p>  There are approximately  25 community colleges in Ohio, so the chances are very good there’s one close to where you live. This means you would also be able to save on room and board, dining, and possibly even hold down a part-time job during your education if you wanted to.</p><p>俄亥俄州大约有25所社区学院，所以很有可能在你住的地方附近有一所。这意味着，如果你愿意的话，你还可以节省食宿费、餐饮费，甚至可以在教育期间做兼职。</p><p>            If you are one of those individuals who actually  likes taking tests, or just really want to complete your degree quickly, then this option is for you.</p><p>如果你是那些真正喜欢参加考试的人之一，或者只是真的想快速完成学位，那么这个选项适合你。</p><p>  There are three standardized ways to test out of your college courses. The term they use for this method is  Credit-by-Exam.</p><p>有三种标准化的方式来测试你的大学课程。他们用来形容这种方法的术语是考试学分。</p><p>      The first and, in my opinion, most difficult option is  AP Exams. AP stands for advanced placement. These subject-specific tests are usually taken during high school, cost around $90, and can award anywhere from 3 – 16 college credits.</p><p>在我看来，第一个也是最难的选择是AP考试。AP代表高级安置。这些特定科目的考试通常在高中期间进行，费用约为90美元，可以授予3到16个大学学分。</p><p>  Yes, you can earn 16 college credits from a single $90 test if you score high enough (here’s an example of  AP credit awards for Cleveland State University). Insane, right?</p><p>是的，如果你的分数足够高，你可以通过一次90美元的考试获得16个大学学分（这里是克利夫兰州立大学AP学分奖励的一个例子）。疯了吧？</p><p>  From personal experience, I do find that these tests tend to be slightly more difficult than the next two alternatives. However, if there is a subject or two that you are especially gifted at, then I would highly recommend you give this option a try.</p><p>从个人经验来看，我确实发现这些测试往往比接下来的两个测试稍微困难一些。然而，如果有一两个你特别擅长的科目，那么我强烈建议你尝试一下这个选项。</p><p>  Here is a list of the  30+ AP Exams available in Ohio. Each test link includes details on the subtopics covered, future testing dates, and recommended study materials.</p><p>以下是俄亥俄州30多项AP考试的列表。每个测试链接都包括所涵盖的子主题、未来测试日期和推荐的研究材料的详细信息。</p><p>        CLEP stands for  College-Level Examination Program. These tests were my first introduction to degree hacking back in 2010 when I tested out of my Biology, Humanities, and Math requirements.</p><p>CLEP代表大学水平考试项目。这些测试是我在2010年第一次引入学位黑客，当时我测试了我的生物、人文和数学要求。</p><p>  They operate similarly to the other items in this category. You pay around $89 for one of 34 different tests, and as long as you meet the minimum accepted score – you get the credits for whichever institution you attend. You can use the following link to see the  official Ohio CLEP guidelines regarding the testing requirements and each Ohio university’s rules for acceptance.</p><p>它们的运作方式与该类别中的其他项目类似。你要为34种不同的考试中的一种支付大约89美元，只要你达到最低录取分数，你就可以获得你就读的任何一所院校的学分。您可以使用以下链接查看有关测试要求和俄亥俄大学验收规则的俄亥俄州CLEP官方指南。</p><p>  I found that the content for these tests was straightforward and, overall, more user-friendly. The study materials range from $20-30 dollars, such as this  College Mathematics Prep Guide.</p><p>我发现这些测试的内容简单明了，总体而言，更方便用户。学习材料从20美元到30美元不等，比如这本大学数学预科指南。</p><p>  Acceptable CLEP scores range from 50-65+ depending on the subject. And, like AP tests, you could be awarded anywhere from 3-16 credits depending on the institution (here is an example from  CSU’s CLEP Guidelines).</p><p>可接受的CLEP分数范围为50-65+，具体取决于受试者。而且，和AP考试一样，根据学校的不同，你可以在任何地方获得3到16个学分（这里是CSU的CLEP指南中的一个例子）。</p><p>    Here are two additional articles written by degree-hackers that drive home the benefits of CLEP:</p><p>以下是由学位黑客撰写的另外两篇文章，它们让我们明白了CLEP的好处：</p><p>        DSST stands for Dantes Subject Standardized Tests. These were originally started by the military to help their men and women turn their knowledge into standardized credentials through testing. However, its been available for both military and non-military individuals for quite some time.</p><p>DSST代表Dantes主题标准化测试。这些最初是由军方发起的，目的是帮助他们的男性和女性通过测试将他们的知识转化为标准化的证书。然而，在相当长的一段时间里，军事和非军事人员都可以使用它。</p><p>  One advantage of DSST tests over CLEP and AP is that a number of  higher-level courses (300 and 400 level) can be completed with these tests. Although, the difficulty with this is that transferring higher-level courses is usually met with more difficulty, since colleges have residency requirements that require students to complete a minimum level of credits at their specific institution ( usually 30+); primarily credits coming from high-level courses.</p><p>与CLEP和AP相比，DSST测试的一个优点是，通过这些测试可以完成许多更高级别的课程（300和400级）。尽管如此，这方面的困难在于，转移更高水平的课程通常会遇到更大的困难，因为大学有居住要求，要求学生在其特定的学校完成最低水平的学分（通常为30+）；主要是来自高水平课程的学分。</p><p>  A DSST test will run you around $85. The study materials tend to be priced a bit higher at $40+, depending on the subject covered. Here is a  full list of the DSST subjects covered, along with more relevant information.</p><p>DSST测试将花费你大约85美元。研究材料的价格往往略高于40美元以上，具体取决于所涵盖的主题。以下是所涵盖的DSST主题的完整列表，以及更多相关信息。</p><p>  If you are a member of the military ( thank you for your service!), there may be additional benefits here I might be missing. That being said, nearly every Credit-by-Exam option has a military discount – so I would likely recommend sticking with the AP and CLEP since they seem to be more widely known in the Ohio higher ed world.</p><p>如果你是军人（感谢你的服务！），这里可能还有我可能错过的其他好处。话虽如此，几乎每个考试学分选项都有军事折扣——因此我可能会建议坚持AP和CLEP，因为它们在俄亥俄州高等教育界似乎更广为人知。</p><p>        The last “classic” option I wanted to cover is called Dual Enrollment for  College Credit Plus. This program allows gifted students from 7 th to 12 th grade to earn both college and high school credits through their courses.</p><p>我想介绍的最后一个“经典”选项是大学学分加成双招生。该项目允许7至12年级的天才学生通过他们的课程获得大学和高中学分。</p><p>  Students are able to take classes at their middle school, high school, and local college in order to complete their courses. Best of all, the  program is 100% free for students and parents.</p><p>学生可以在他们的中学、高中和当地大学上课以完成他们的课程。最重要的是，该项目对学生和家长100%免费。</p><p>  As you could imagine, there are many guidelines that need to be followed since the program deals with minors. Ohio has created an extremely  comprehensive FAQ section to help with this.</p><p>正如你所能想象的，由于该项目涉及未成年人，因此需要遵循许多准则。俄亥俄州已经创建了一个非常全面的FAQ部分来帮助解决这个问题。</p><p>  My wife was actually a participant in this program and completed both her high school and Associate&#39;s degree on the same day at the age of 17. I know, she&#39;s amazing.</p><p>我的妻子实际上是这个项目的参与者，她完成了高中学业和大学学业；在17岁的同一天，他就拿到了学位。我知道，她&#39；太棒了。</p><p>          I shouldn’t have to preface this by saying  nothing is ever 100% free, but I will just in case you believe the hype that some articles and admissions representatives will try to sell you.</p><p>我不必在开场白中说什么都不是100%免费的，但我会说，以防你相信一些文章和招生代表会试图向你推销的炒作。</p><p>  Yes, there are  legitimate tuition-free colleges in the US, but every single one has a stipulation to make it possible such as mandatory work programs, extra fees, or contractual obligations upon graduation. Still, if the circumstances fit your situation, these can be excellent alternatives.</p><p>是的，美国有合法的免学费大学，但每一所大学都有一项规定使之成为可能，比如强制性工作计划、额外费用或毕业时的合同义务。不过，如果情况适合你的情况，这些可能是很好的选择。</p><p>      Work Colleges are institutions that cost students $0 in tuition but require them to work during their degree. The work usually consists of both traditional on-campus jobs (bookstore, library, dining hall) as well as maintenance positions (lawn services, building maintenance).</p><p>职业学院是指学费为0美元但要求学生在获得学位期间工作的机构。这项工作通常包括传统的校园工作（书店、图书馆、餐厅）和维护岗位（草坪服务、建筑维护）。</p><p>  These differ from work-study programs because the student’s entire tuition is paid by the program, rather than giving them a small hourly wage. Currently, there are 8 federally approved Work Colleges in the US that practice this model:</p><p>这与勤工俭学项目不同，因为学生的全部学费由该项目支付，而不是给他们一点小时工资。目前，美国有8所联邦政府批准的职业学院实行这种模式：</p><p>    Alice Lloyd, Berea, and  Ozarks are starred because I’ve either personally met people from these programs or they specifically accept Ohio students.</p><p>Alice Lloyd、Berea和Ozarks是主演，因为我要么亲自见过这些项目的人，要么他们专门接受俄亥俄州的学生。</p><p>        If you are okay pursuing your  degree outside of Ohio or online, then one of these options may be a good fit for you. They all practice some form of tuition-remission or guaranteed scholarship model. However, students will still be on the hook for some fees.</p><p>如果你可以在俄亥俄州以外的地方或网上攻读学位，那么其中一个选择可能非常适合你。他们都实行某种形式的学费减免或奖学金担保模式。然而，学生们仍将面临一些费用。</p><p>  Barclay College (Kansas) – No tuition if you live on campus. Room and board will cost you $9,000 – $12,000.</p><p>巴克莱学院（堪萨斯州）——如果你住在校园里，就不用交学费。食宿费用为9000-12000美元。</p><p>  Curtis Institute of Music (Pennsylvania) – No tuition, but annual fee (around $2,000) in addition to room and board.</p><p>柯蒂斯音乐学院（宾夕法尼亚州）——没有学费，但除了食宿费，还有年费（约2000美元）。</p><p>  Deep Springs College (California) – No tuition, similar to Work College model, although only offers 2-year degrees.</p><p>深泉学院（加利福尼亚州）——无学费，类似于职业学院模式，但只提供两年制学位。</p><p>  Webb Institute (New York) – They focus on engineering programs, but since it is based in New York the room and board costs start anywhere from $15,000 to $20,000.</p><p>韦伯研究所（纽约）——他们专注于工程项目，但由于总部位于纽约，食宿费用从15000美元到20000美元不等。</p><p>  University of the People (Online) – This innovative online college offers everything from associates to masters degrees and charges $0 in tuition. However, they do have a fee per course so a complete degree will cost you anywhere from $1,500 to $4,000 depending on the academic level.</p><p>人民大学（在线）-这个创新的在线大学提供从同事到硕士学位，收费0美元的学费。然而，他们每门课程都有费用，所以一个完整的学位需要花费1500美元到4000美元不等，这取决于学术水平。</p><p>  Military Colleges (Varies) – I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the benefits of serving in the US Armed Forces. I know very little about this area of higher education; only of what I’ve heard from about half-a-dozen close friends serving in various branches. Here are the 5 academies referenced in various free tuition forums online: United States  Air Force Academy, United States  Coast Guard Academy, United States  Merchant Marine Academy, United States  Military Academy, United States  Naval Academy.</p><p>军事学院（各不相同）——如果我没有提到在美国军队服役的好处，那我就是失职了。我对高等教育这一领域知之甚少；我只听过大约六个在各个分支机构服务的密友说的话。以下是各种免费在线论坛中提到的5所学院：美国空军学院、美国海岸警卫队学院、美国商船学院、美国军事学院、美国海军学院。</p><p>    As the realm of higher education continues to buckle and shift, I expect this list of no tuition colleges will expand. I also imagine many more free college alternatives will become available to Ohio residents. What’s most important is that you find a program that fits your needs and does its best to set you up for success by not saddling you with unnecessary debt.</p><p>随着高等教育领域的不断缩小和转变，我预计这一无学费大学的名单将会扩大。我还设想，俄亥俄州居民将获得更多的免费大学选择。最重要的是，你要找到一个适合你需要的计划，并尽最大努力让你不必背负不必要的债务，从而获得成功。</p><p>        Alright, now we get to talk about some of the exciting options I&#39;ve stumbled upon during my time in higher education. My goal with this list is to build it up over time so that it becomes the  #1 resource for Ohio college students.</p><p>好了，现在我们来谈谈一些令人兴奋的选择，我&#39；我在接受高等教育期间偶然发现了。我的目标是随着时间的推移不断积累，使之成为俄亥俄州大学生的第一资源。</p><p>  I expect the number of alternative credential paths will explode in the coming decades. Even so, the options we have available at this moment are incredible.</p><p>我预计在未来几十年里，替代凭证路径的数量将激增。即便如此，我们目前拥有的选择还是令人难以置信。</p><p>      Competency Based Education (CBE) is easily my favorite option in this category; albeit one of the more controversial ones.</p><p>基于能力的教育（CBE）很容易成为这一类别中我最喜欢的选择；尽管这是一个更有争议的问题。</p><p>  CBE challenges most conventional learning theories by allowing students to move as quickly as they desire through the material, so long as they can display “competency” for what has been covered. Competency can be shown through passing tests, writing papers, giving presentations, and more.</p><p>CBE挑战了大多数传统的学习理论，它允许学生在阅读材料时随心所欲地快速移动，只要他们能够展示所学内容的“能力”。能力可以通过通过考试、写论文、做报告等方式来体现。</p><p>  Because CBE programs don’t believe time should be a fixed element in education, they charge a  fixed sum by semester rather than by course. Ambitious students can complete as many courses as they want within a single paid semester. This is how I completed a  Master of Education degree in 3 months for less than $3,400.</p><p>由于CBE项目不认为时间应该是教育中的一个固定要素，所以他们按学期而不是按课程收取固定费用。有抱负的学生可以在一个带薪学期内完成任意数量的课程。这就是我如何用不到3400美元在3个月内完成教育硕士学位的过程。</p><p>  CBE programs struggled in the early days to achieve accreditation because established colleges were terrified that such a model would break the system. Thankfully, that hasn’t happened. What I’ve found is that CBE is great for career-minded, disciplined students. It definitely does not work for everybody. If you know you are a person who needs a higher level of accountability and would benefit from a weekly, face-to-face with your instructor, then this route probably isn’t for you.</p><p>CBE项目在早期很难获得认证，因为老牌大学担心这样的模式会破坏系统。谢天谢地，这并没有发生。我发现CBE对有事业心、纪律严明的学生来说非常好。这肯定不适用于所有人。如果你知道自己是一个需要更高责任感的人，并且每周都能与你的导师面对面交流，那么这条路线可能不适合你。</p><p>  But, if you&#39;re driven by the idea that you could get a regionally accredited bachelor&#39;s degree in as little as 6 months to 1 year ( even though moving that quickly is not recommended), then you could do well in a program like this.</p><p>但是，如果你&#39；你的想法是，你可以获得地区认可的学士学位#39；只要6个月到1年就可以拿到s学位（尽管不建议这么快），那么你就可以在这样的项目中取得好成绩。</p><p>  There are about a dozen CBE programs floating around online, but I only feel comfortable sharing 4 of them and recommending only 1.</p><p>网上大约有十几个CBE项目，但我只觉得分享其中的4个，推荐1个比较舒服。</p><p>            You can move as quickly as you want, so that you can finish more cheaply.</p><p>你可以随心所欲地快速移动，这样你就可以更便宜地完成任务。</p><p>            The  Quantic School of Business and Technology first made waves in 2016 (it was named  Smartly at the time) when they decided to offer a free MBA program.</p><p>匡迪克商学院（Quantic School of Business and Technology）在2016年（当时的名字叫Smartly）首次掀起热潮，当时他们决定提供一个免费的MBA课程。</p><p>    By using a model of  reverse-tuition. Instead of charging students to attend their school, they charge companies to recruit from their elite group of students. Quantic has made this work by accepting only the most outstanding candidates from around the world. At this time, they are arguably the most selective MBA program in the world.</p><p>通过使用逆向教学模式。他们不向学生收取上学费用，而是向公司收取从精英学生群体中招聘的费用。Quantic通过只接受来自世界各地最优秀的候选人来实现这一目标。目前，它们可以说是世界上最具选择性的MBA课程。</p><p>  The downside is that they are still fairly new and unknown, which is a problem since one of the major upsides of acquiring an MBA is name recognition (i.e., Harvard, Stanford, etc.).</p><p>不利的一面是，他们仍然是相当新的和未知的，这是一个问题，因为获得MBA的主要优势之一是姓名识别（如哈佛、斯坦福等）。</p><p>  In the last few years, they’ve also made the change to becoming a mobile-first educational experience.  Data consistently shows that the majority of online activity now takes place on mobile devices. Education has tried to buck trends in the past, only to their detriment. So, Quantic may be ahead of the curve, but this is a strategy I expect to see most universities adopt (at least for their online programs) within the next decade.</p><p>在过去的几年里，他们也做出了改变，成为移动第一教育体验。数据一致显示，现在大多数在线活动都发生在移动设备上。教育试图与过去的趋势背道而驰，结果却适得其反。因此，Quantic可能走在了前面，但我预计在未来十年内，大多数大学都会采用这一策略（至少在在线课程上）。</p><p>      Mobile-first design which means lessons are more succinct, require a lower overall time commitment, and produce more engaging content</p><p>Mobile first设计，这意味着课程更简洁，所需的总时间更少，并产生更吸引人的内容</p><p>        Most of the advice so far has centered around full-on degree programs or credential alternatives. The next option deals with trading out individual courses for cheaper, better (in some ways) choices.</p><p>到目前为止，大多数建议都集中在学位课程或证书的选择上。下一个选择是用个别课程换取更便宜、更好（在某些方面）的选择。</p><p>  Outlier is a company started by one of the founders of  MasterClass. If you haven’t heard of MasterClass, it’s essentially a course platform for learning from the elite: the best chefs, actresses, writers, etc. I took a class from Malcolm Gladwell from it and absolutely loved the experience.</p><p>Outlier是一家由MasterClass创始人之一创办的公司。如果你没听说过MasterClass，它本质上是一个向精英学习的课程平台：最好的厨师、女演员、作家等等。我从Malcolm Gladwell那里上了一节课，我非常喜欢这段经历。</p><p>  What they do well is bridge the gap between  entertainment and education. The videos are beautifully produced. The LMS (learning management system) is minimalist and efficient. The whole experience feels like the Michelin star equivalent of online courses.</p><p>他们擅长的是弥合娱乐和教育之间的鸿沟。视频制作精美。LMS（学习管理系统）是一个极简高效的系统。整个体验就像是米其林之星的在线课程。</p><p>  Outlier plans to do the same thing for higher education: present college course material through beautiful videos and minimal learning experiences.</p><p>Outlier计划为高等教育做同样的事情：通过漂亮的视频和最少的学习体验呈现大学课程材料。</p><p>          Awards 3 credits from the University of Pittsburgh – which can then be transferred to any other university</p><p>授予匹兹堡大学3个学分，然后转入其他大学。</p><p>    As you could imagine, this model has rubbed some people the wrong way. One professor writing for Pitt News  listed his arguments against Outlier which included poor assessment structures, lack of 1-on-1 communication, and accessibility of technology.</p><p>正如你所能想象的，这种模式给一些人带来了不好的影响。一位为皮特新闻撰稿的教授列举了他反对离群值的观点，其中包括糟糕的评估结构、缺乏一对一的沟通以及技术的可及性。</p><p>  While some of the arguments may be valid, they are also exaggerated. My personal opinion is that Outlier won’t fundamentally change how colleges operate ( because they are rather conservative in their mission).</p><p>虽然有些论点可能是正确的，但也有些言过其实。我个人的观点是，Outlier不会从根本上改变大学的运作方式（因为它们在使命上相当保守）。</p><p>  However, I do expect they will push student expectations of what a lecture should look and sound and feel like. Also, I think their customer-centric view of LMS design will also force the industry to upgrade and stop using technology that looks like it&#39;s from the &#39;80s to deliver content that students are paying tens of thousands of dollars to access.</p><p>然而，我确实希望他们会推动学生对讲座的外观、声音和感觉的期望。此外，我认为他们以客户为中心的LMS设计观也将迫使行业升级并停止使用看起来像它的技术&#39；来自&#39；80年代，学生们要支付数万美元才能访问的内容。</p><p>      If you are having trouble with an introductory course, try completing it through Outlier instead – you’ll likely have a much better experience</p><p>如果你在一门入门课程上遇到困难，试着通过Outlier完成它——你可能会有更好的体验</p><p>          Remember MOOCs? Massive Open Online Courses – people love to hate them, and then  love them again, and then go back to hating them.</p><p>还记得MOOC吗？大规模的开放在线课程——人们喜欢恨他们，然后又爱他们，然后又恨他们。</p><p>  A MOOC is essentially a series of recorded lectures that you watch in order to pass an assessment and receive a certificate. People thought this format was going to change the education industry forever. What they found is that  lectures are boring. The most successful courses were only seeing a  3% completion rate, if that.</p><p>MOOC本质上是一系列你为了通过评估并获得证书而观看的录音讲座。人们认为这种形式将永远改变教育行业。他们发现讲座很无聊。最成功的课程只有3%的完成率。</p><p>  Furthermore, employers don’t value certificates the way they do degrees, certifications, and other industry-specific credentials.</p><p>此外，雇主不像对待学位、证书和其他特定行业的证书那样重视证书。</p><p>  To remedy this, MOOCs have started to explore better credentialing options. The one worth mentioned is called  MicroMasters. Think of these credentials as Certificates+. They are valued more highly because they require students to complete a series of courses and assessments, rather than a single one.</p><p>为了解决这个问题，MOOC已经开始探索更好的认证方案。值得一提的是微硕士。将这些凭证视为证书+。它们的价值更高，因为它们要求学生完成一系列课程和评估，而不是单一的课程和评估。</p><p>  The part I am most excited about is how these MicroMasters feed up into more established credentials, such as  fully accredited master’s degrees. The way it works is that the micro degree acts as an initial “chunk.” Once this chunk is completed, then you’re able to apply it towards a full program – like the  University of Maryland’s MBA program.</p><p>我最兴奋的部分是，这些微硕士如何获得更为成熟的证书，比如完全认证的硕士学位。它的工作方式是，微学位充当初始“块”一旦胡全片完成，你就可以把它应用到一个完整的程序中——比如马里兰大学的MBA课程。</p><p>  EdX now offers  13 fully accredited master’s programs that can be started, to varying levels, using cheap or free MOOC-versions of their online courses. The programs themselves still cost between $10,000 - $20,000+. However, that is still far less than equivalent programs.</p><p>EdX现在提供13个完全认证的硕士课程，可以使用廉价或免费的MOOC版本的在线课程，在不同程度上启动。这些项目本身的成本仍在1万至2万美元之间。然而，这仍然远远低于同等项目。</p><p>          This article contains a lot of information, so I want to close by offering you a strategy to apply these offerings in the best way possible according to your situation.</p><p>这篇文章包含了很多信息，所以我想在结束时为您提供一个策略，根据您的情况以最好的方式应用这些产品。</p><p>      Finished your associate&#39;s degree, or as much of it as possible, by the time you graduate high school.</p><p>完成了你的同事&#39；到你高中毕业的时候，你将获得学士学位，或者尽可能多的学位。</p><p>  Enroll in a Competency Based Education (CBE) program option to get your bachelor&#39;s degree in 1 year or less (and for less than $10,000 total).</p><p>参加基于能力的教育（CBE）项目，获得学士学位#39；一年或更短时间内获得s学位（总费用不超过10000美元）。</p><p>  Get at least 1 year of work experience in a desired field before pursuing any master&#39;s options (trust me, this experience will help you make a more informed decision).</p><p>在攻读硕士学位之前，在所需领域获得至少1年的工作经验；s选项（相信我，这次经历将帮助你做出更明智的决定）。</p><p>    If you just  graduated high school and want to finish a degree as quickly as possible.</p><p>如果你刚刚高中毕业，想尽快完成一个学位。</p><p>  Take CLEP tests. I would aim for 1 a month for 6-12 months. You could realistically knock out the first 2 years of your college degree for under $500.</p><p>做CLEP测试。我的目标是6-12个月内每月1次。实际上，你可以花不到500美元完成大学学位的前两年。</p><p>  Check with the 4-year college you want to enroll in for what scores they accept.</p><p>向你想注册的四年制大学询问他们接受的分数。</p><p>  I would recommend going the CBE route (here is the  CLEP scores needed for WGU).</p><p>我建议选择CBE路线（这里是WGU所需的CLEP分数）。</p><p>  Then get 1-2 years of work experience before enrolling in masters if that is your desire.</p><p>如果你愿意的话，在申请硕士学位之前先获得1-2年的工作经验。</p><p>      Enroll in a bachelor’s program – don’t bother with an associate’s degree if you already have work experience.</p><p>报名参加学士学位课程——如果你已经有工作经验，就不用麻烦获得副学士学位。</p><p>  If you plan to stay in the field you are currently working in, start a master’s immediately after completing your bachelor’s degree.</p><p>如果你打算留在你目前工作的领域，在完成学士学位后立即开始攻读硕士学位。</p><p>  If you want to change fields, enroll in a MicroMasters so that you can test the waters of a different field for a very low cost (time-wise and financially).</p><p>如果你想更换场地，请注册MicroMasters，这样你就可以以非常低的成本（时间和财务）测试不同场地的水。</p><p>      Enroll in a community college that offers night and weekend courses (90%+ of them do, I promise).</p><p>注册一所提供夜间和周末课程的社区学院（我保证，其中90%以上是这样）。</p><p>  See if your community college offers bachelor degrees ( at least 6 in Ohio currently do).</p><p>看看你的社区学院是否提供学士学位（俄亥俄州目前至少有6个）。</p><p>  If you find yourself struggling with a course, or want to test the waters with online learning, enroll in Outlier’s offerings. </p><p>如果你发现自己在一门课程中苦苦挣扎，或者想通过在线学习来试水，请注册Outlier的课程。</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/黑客/">#黑客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/大学/">#大学</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/学位/">#学位</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/degree/">#degree</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
