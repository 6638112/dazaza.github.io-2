The goal was simple but unheard of in the systematically overworked video game industry: to gauge interest in a four-day workweek.</p><p>去年9月16日，黑鸟互动公司（Blackbird Interactive）的管理层发布了一项调查。该公司是《硬体空间：拆船者》（Hardspace:Shippreaker）和即将上映的战略游戏《家园3》（Homeworld 3）的300人工作室。这个目标很简单，但在系统性工作过度的电子游戏行业，这是前所未闻的：衡量人们对每周工作四天的兴趣。</p><p>  The timing was, to say the least, auspicious. One anonymous respondent described the “Shipbreaker” team as stressed and burned out, explaining that supporting the game’s early access release had taken “a heavy and unexpected toll.”</p><p>至少可以说，这个时机是幸运的。一名匿名受访者称“拆船者”团队压力很大，筋疲力尽，并解释说，支持游戏的早期发布带来了“沉重而意外的损失”</p><p> Today, Blackbird announced it will permanently adopt a Monday-Thursday workweek across all six of its projects. But the journey to get there was not without bumps in the road. Some at the studio worried that in an industry  inundated with periods of brutal crunch, removing hours from the week would just necessitate more of it. Others looked at the late stage of development projects like “Shipbreaker” were in and feared the timing of such a change couldn’t have been worse. A three-month long test of the four-day workweek quickly disabused them of these notions. But concerns remain as to whether a four-day workweek can keep overwork at bay — or even be maintained — in an industry where the majority of the workforce is not unionized and is susceptible to sudden shifts brought on by buyouts, layoffs and executive whims.</p><p>今天，Blackbird宣布，它将在所有六个项目中永久采用周一至周四的工作周。但到达那里的旅程并非没有颠簸。演播室的一些人担心，在一个充斥着残酷紧缩时期的行业，每周减少几个小时只会需要更多的时间。其他人则关注“拆船机”等开发项目的后期阶段，担心这种变化的时机再糟糕不过了。为期三个月的四天工作制测试很快让他们摆脱了这些观念。但人们仍然担心，在一个大多数劳动力都没有加入工会的行业，每周工作四天是否可以避免——甚至可以维持——过度工作，而且容易受到收购、裁员和高管异想天开带来的突然变化的影响。</p><p>   The “Shipbreaker” team was one of the two teams participating in the four-day workweek test, which ran from Sept. 20, 2021 to Dec. 10, 2021. While the other team, working on a roguelike deck-building game code named “Owl,” was in the early preproduction stages of development, the “Shipbreaker” team was truly in the thick of it — and had been for quite some time. The game, in which players crawl through the guts of derelict spaceships and slice them up for salvage, launched into early access on Steam in 2020. Since then, Shipbreaker’s team had been working to get it across the finish line, maintain its sizable, content-hungry community and live up to the terms of a deal with French publisher Focus Entertainment. According to the survey, the results of which were shared with The Post, some developers were working over 40 hours each week.</p><p>“破船”队是参加为期4天的工作周测试的两支队伍之一，从9月20, 2021到2021年12月10日。另一个团队正在开发一款名为“猫头鹰”的类似流氓的甲板建造游戏，当时正处于开发的早期前期阶段，而“拆船者”团队则真正处于开发的鼎盛时期，而且已经持续了相当长的一段时间。游戏中，玩家在废弃的宇宙飞船的内脏中爬行，并将其切成碎片进行打捞。游戏于2020年在Steam上启动。从那时起，拆船者的团队一直在努力让它越过终点线，维持其规模庞大、内容饥渴的社区，并履行与法国出版商福克斯娱乐公司达成的协议条款。根据这项调查，一些开发商每周工作时间超过40小时。调查结果已与《华盛顿邮报》分享。</p><p>  Blackbird, an independent studio trying to stay aloft in a time of  rapid industry consolidation and a growing  talent shortage, realized a four-day workweek could kill multiple birds with one stone.</p><p>Blackbird是一家独立的工作室，在行业快速整合和人才短缺日益严重的情况下，它试图保持高层地位。它意识到一周工作四天可能一举两得。</p><p> “When people get stressed out and burned out, you can’t really treat it. They need to take a big chunk of time off, and even then, they come back frazzled. We’re looking at how we can prevent this in an ongoing way,” said Blackbird CEO Rob Cunningham. There was also the question of retention: “An independent studio like Blackbird doesn’t benefit from the infinite resources of these mega corporations,” he said. “We have to do what we can to communicate to the talent what’s the upside of coming here.”</p><p>Blackbird首席执行官罗伯·坎宁安（Rob Cunningham）说：“当人们感到压力过大、精疲力竭时，你无法真正治疗。他们需要大量休息，即便如此，他们还是会疲惫不堪地回来。我们正在研究如何持续预防这种情况。”。还有保留的问题：“像Blackbird这样的独立工作室不会从这些大公司的无限资源中受益，”他说。“我们必须尽我们所能与人才交流来到这里的好处。”</p><p>    Blackbird’s workweek reshuffle comes during a time when workers across all sectors are reevaluating their relationship with their jobs. The covid-born  “Great Resignation” has seen millions of Americans quit their jobs, while workers at global companies like  Starbucks and  Amazon have moved to unionize and improve their workplaces.</p><p>Blackbird的工作周调整正值所有行业的员工都在重新评估他们与工作的关系之际。新冠病毒引发的“大辞职”已经导致数百万美国人辞职，而星巴克和亚马逊等跨国公司的员工已经开始组建工会并改善工作场所。</p><p> The idea of the four-day workweek is not new. Louis Hyman, a historian of work and business at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations, explained that the current five-day workweek composed of eight-hour days was born of factory worker strikes in the 19th and 20th centuries, as well as nationwide union strength in the years following World War I. After workers pressured the likes of  Henry Ford and, eventually, the United States government to adopt the five-day workweek, there were widespread calls for a four-day workweek. Recently, the concept has resurfaced. Companies  as large as Panasonic have implemented versions of it, as have video game studios like “Guardians of the Galaxy” developer Eidos-Montréal and indie studios Vodeo Games and KO_OP. During 2020, “Fortnite” developer Epic instituted a policy of giving employees alternating Fridays off, but shelved that change late last year despite employee uproar, according to a  report by Bloomberg.</p><p>每周工作四天的想法并不新鲜。康奈尔大学（Cornell University）工业与劳动关系学院（School of Industrial and Labor Relations）的工作与商业历史学家路易斯·海曼（Louis Hyman）解释说，目前由八小时组成的五天工作周产生于19世纪和20世纪的工厂工人罢工，第一次世界大战后，工人们向亨利·福特（Henry Ford）等人施压，最终迫使美国政府实行五天工作制，因此，人们普遍呼吁实行四天工作制。最近，这一概念再次浮出水面。松下（Panasonic）等大型公司已经实施了该软件的版本，像《银河卫士》（Guarders of the Galaxy）开发商艾多斯·蒙特勒（Eidos Montréal）和独立工作室沃迪奥（Vodeo Games）和科尤（KO_OP）这样的视频游戏工作室也实施了该软件。2020年，“Fortnite”开发商Epic制定了一项政策，让员工每周五轮流休假，但据彭博社的一份报告称，尽管员工骚动，该公司还是在去年年底搁置了这项改革。</p><p> “In a lot of ways, the belief that the normal job is 9-to-5, Monday through Friday, has been steadily falling apart since the 1970s,” Hyman said, citing the draining nature of modern knowledge jobs, the fragmentation of service work via the gig economy and the need for many to work multiple jobs. “There’s been a big reset with covid in thinking about, ‘What is work? Why do I have to go to the office? And if I don’t have to go to the office, do I have to work five days a week?’ ”</p><p>海曼说：“从很多方面来看，自20世纪70年代以来，认为正常工作是周一到周五朝九晚五的观念一直在逐渐瓦解。”他列举了现代知识型工作的枯竭性、零散的服务业工作以及许多人需要从事多个工作。“在思考‘什么是工作？为什么我必须去办公室？如果我不必去办公室，我是否必须每周工作五天？’时，新冠病毒引发了一场大的调整。”</p><p>   Still, Blackbird employees had concerns going into the four-day workweek test. How would a team already struggling at 40-plus hours per week manage to hit their milestones with eight fewer hours? What would they have to streamline? And would some team members feel only minor ripples from the change, while others dealt with full-blown aftershocks?</p><p>尽管如此，Blackbird的员工还是担心要参加每周工作四天的测试。一个每周工作40多个小时的团队如何能在少8个小时的情况下实现他们的里程碑？他们需要精简什么？一些团队成员是否只会感受到变化带来的轻微涟漪，而其他人则会应对全面的余震？</p><p> “I think immediately my mind went to, ‘We can’t do that,’ ” said Elliot Hudson, game director on “Shipbreaker.” “When it was first proposed to me, I just flat out said, ‘No, it’s not going to work for this team.’ ”</p><p>“我想我立刻想到，‘我们不能那样做，’”在《拆船者》中担任游戏总监的埃利奥特·哈德森说“第一次向我求婚时，我直截了当地说，‘不，这对这个团队不起作用。’”</p><p> It wasn’t a seamless transition. For some, like “Shipbreaker” Lead Producer Jessica Klyne, the growing pains extended even as far as the six-week mark. She and the team determined that they needed to trim fat from their day-to-day schedules, but acclimating took time and discipline.</p><p>这不是一个无缝的过渡。对一些人来说，比如《拆船者》的主要制片人杰西卡·克莱恩，成长的痛苦甚至延续到了六周。她和团队决定，他们需要从日常日程中削减脂肪，但适应需要时间和纪律。</p><p>   “We stopped doing one-hour meetings and even shortened some to ten-minute check-ins,” said Klyne. “We questioned the attendance of everyone in meetings and encouraged all attendees at all levels to question their own attendance. We were ruthless when it came to protecting our team’s time. We had to be.”</p><p>“我们停止了一个小时的会议，甚至把一些签到时间缩短到了十分钟，”克莱恩说。“我们质疑每个人出席会议的情况，并鼓励所有级别的与会者质疑自己的出席情况。在保护团队时间方面，我们是无情的。我们必须这样做。”</p><p> Game-specific challenges had to be optimized too. “Normally we’d [be like], ‘Let’s just build a ship and then figure out what’s wrong with it,’ ” Hudson said. “This time, we tried to cast our minds ahead to, ‘What do we think the pain points are going to be that we’ve run into in the past? How do we design the ship to just completely avoid those things?’ ”</p><p>游戏特定的挑战也必须优化。哈德逊说：“通常我们会说，‘我们先造一艘船，然后找出它的毛病。’”。“这一次，我们试图让我们的头脑向前看，‘我们认为我们过去遇到的痛点是什么？我们如何设计这艘船以完全避免这些事情？’”</p><p> Other stumbling blocks included holiday weeks in which workers already would have had a day off.</p><p>其他绊脚石包括休假周，在这几周里，工人们本可以休息一天。</p><p>  “It’s an ongoing conversation,” said Blackbird Director of Operations Katie Findlay. “But generally speaking, we’re just communicating that if it’s a holiday Monday, you get a three-day workweek; good for you.”</p><p>“这是一场持续的对话，”黑鸟运营总监凯蒂·芬德利说。“但总的来说，我们只是在沟通，如果星期一是假日，你可以每周工作三天；这对你有好处。”</p><p>  As the test progressed, it did not take long for workers to find that their workdays and — more importantly — their overall mental health had improved.</p><p>随着测试的进行，工人们没过多久就发现他们的工作日，更重要的是，他们的整体心理健康状况有所改善。</p><p> “Personally, it makes me feel like I can stay in the industry longer than I thought I could,” said the studio’s creative director, Trey Smith. “There’s a soul tax that comes with shipping every game.”</p><p>该工作室的创意总监特雷·史密斯说：“就我个人而言，这让我觉得我可以在这个行业停留的时间比我想象的要长。”。“每场比赛都会带来灵魂税。”</p><p> There were also less obvious, unanticipated benefits. “When you have a day off that you can use to go see a doctor and you don’t have to tell your co-workers, it adds a level of privacy I thought was really nice,” said Leelee Scaldaferri, a 3D artist on “Shipbreaker,” who also noted that running errands during the pandemic on days when stores weren’t crowded alleviated stress.</p><p>还有一些不太明显的、意想不到的好处。《拆船机》的3D艺术家李莉·斯伯塔费里说：“当你有一天可以去看医生，而不必告诉同事时，这会增加我认为非常好的隐私水平。”她还指出，在疫情期间，在商店不拥挤的日子里跑腿可以缓解压力。</p><p>   “Not having Friday there anymore made the four days more precious,” said Scaldaferri. “Essentially, in so many words, I didn’t f--- around as much.”</p><p>“再也没有星期五了，这四天就更宝贵了，”斯伯塔费里说。“从本质上说，用这么多的话来说，我并没有像现在这样四处奔波。”</p><p>  By the time the test wound down, numerous members of the “Shipbreaker” team concurred: The four-day workweek was more than just a success.</p><p>测试结束时，“拆船者”团队的许多成员都同意了这一点：每周工作四天不仅仅是一次成功。</p><p>  “Our team was under huge pressure and on the verge of burnout due to the nature of working from home during a critical period of production, with the added stress of covid on top of that,” said Klyne. “When the trial was over, it was obvious the four-day workweek saved us. I don’t think we could have got to where we are today without it.”</p><p>“由于在生产的关键时期在家工作的性质，加上新冠病毒带来的额外压力，我们的团队承受着巨大的压力，处于精疲力竭的边缘，”Klyne说。“审判结束后，很明显，每周工作四天拯救了我们。我认为没有它，我们不可能达到今天的水平。”</p><p>  Hudson went so far as to say the “Shipbreaker” team “completely avoided crunch” during the test phase despite his concerns that they’d have to crunch  because of it. Findlay cautioned, however, that industry professionals should not think of the four-day workweek as a silver bullet, but rather one of many longer-term solutions to preserve employee health even when inevitable periods of more intense work — say, ahead of a deadline or milestone — do arrive.</p><p>哈德逊甚至表示，“拆船机”团队在测试阶段“完全避免了挤压”，尽管他担心他们会因此而挤压。然而，芬德利警告说，行业专业人士不应将每周工作四天视为一剂灵丹妙药，而应将其视为许多保护员工健康的长期解决方案之一，即使在不可避免的更紧张的工作时间——比如在最后期限或里程碑之前——到来时也是如此。</p><p> “When it comes to those crunch times, we want you to be not already burned out,” Findlay said.</p><p>芬德利说：“在关键时刻，我们希望你们不要已经筋疲力尽。”。</p><p>  In the end, 100 percent of 51 developers surveyed after the test said they wanted to permanently switch to the four-day workweek, compared to 82 percent who believed a four-day workweek was better than a five-day workweek before the test. Additionally, 91 percent said it improved their work-life balance, 89 percent said the same of wellness, 90 percent believed it will improve retention and 79 percent said it bolstered their ability to complete work.</p><p>最终，在测试后接受调查的51名开发人员中，100%的人表示他们希望永久性地改用每周四天的工作制，而82%的人认为测试前每周四天的工作制优于每周五天的工作制。此外，91%的人说它改善了他们的工作生活平衡，89%的人说健康也是如此，90%的人认为它会提高记忆力，79%的人说它增强了他们完成工作的能力。</p><p>  But the four-day workweek as envisioned by Blackbird isn’t without its structural question marks. As with Saturdays and Sundays, workers are free to use Fridays as they please, whether that means chilling out, doing chores or wrapping up work that previously slipped through the cracks. It falls on leadership to avoid pressuring workers, explicitly or implicitly, into regularly doing the latter.</p><p>但Blackbird设想的每周四天工作制并非没有结构性的问号。与周六和周日一样，工人们可以随心所欲地利用周五，无论这意味着休息、做家务或结束之前漏掉的工作。领导层应该避免对工人施加压力，无论是明示还是暗示，让他们定期做后者。</p><p>  “One of the key pieces to all of this is that our leadership, whether it’s studio or per team, has to set the example,” said Findlay. “So if your manager or producer is coming in and obviously working on Friday — answering emails and all of that — then me if I’m, like, a junior programmer, I’m going to feel the need to do that as well. … So we’re really doubling down on messaging to our leads to make sure they’re modeling behavior they want to see.”</p><p>芬德利说：“所有这一切的关键之一是，我们的领导层，无论是工作室还是团队，都必须树立榜样。”。“所以，如果你的经理或制作人周五来上班，显然是在工作——回复电子邮件等等——那么如果我是一名初级程序员，我也会觉得有必要这么做……所以我们真的要加倍向潜在客户发信息，以确保他们在模拟他们希望看到的行为。”</p><p>  Data suggests that the test was not entirely successful on this front. Of employees surveyed, 29 percent said they worked 32 hours per week during the final four weeks of the test, while 47 percent said they worked 32-36 hours, 12 percent said they worked 36-40 hours and another 12 percent said they worked more than 40. Speaking with The Post, some leads confessed they’d been working a few hours on Fridays during the test phase — though largely to ensure successive weeks were organized well enough that their subordinates wouldn’t have to sweat coming in on their new Saturday, which was Friday.</p><p>数据表明，这项测试在这方面并不完全成功。在接受调查的员工中，29%的人说他们在考试的最后四周每周工作32小时，47%的人说他们工作32-36小时，12%的人说他们工作36-40小时，另有12%的人说他们工作超过40小时。在接受《华盛顿邮报》采访时，一些潜在客户承认，在测试阶段，他们在周五工作了几个小时——不过主要是为了确保连续几周的工作安排得足够好，以便他们的下属在新的周六（即周五）来上班时不必流汗。</p><p> “It tends to be mostly the leaders and the directors who are spending that extra time to get ahead on tasks and give enough details to tasks that the people below them don’t need to work that extra time,” said Hudson. “Normally it’d be like, ‘Here, I’ll give you a task and then we can have a conversation about it.’ Now my job is to make sure there’s enough details in that task that we don’t have to have that conversation.”</p><p>哈德森说：“往往是领导和董事花了额外的时间来完成任务，并为任务提供足够的细节，而他们下面的人不需要额外工作。”。“通常情况下，我会说，‘在这里，我给你一个任务，然后我们可以就它进行对话。’现在我的工作是确保任务中有足够的细节，我们不必进行对话。”</p><p> Blackbird Chief Creative Officer Rory McGuire said company policy states that if anybody decides to come in on Fridays, they must be compensated with another day.</p><p>Blackbird首席创意官Rory McGuire表示，公司政策规定，如果任何人决定在周五上班，他们必须在另一天得到补偿。</p><p> “If anyone is working [on] a Friday more than a few times a year,” said McGuire, “that’s very strong evidence we need to look at our organization to figure out where the process is failing.”</p><p>麦奎尔说：“如果有人一年中在星期五工作的次数超过几次，这是非常有力的证据，我们需要审视我们的组织，找出这个过程失败的地方。”</p><p> Emma Kinema, a campaign lead at CODE-CWA, the labor union aiding  workers at companies like Activision Blizzard, pointed out that even the most ideal version of Blackbird’s four-day workweek arrangement still leaves final say and veto power in the hands of management. She went on to note that Vodeo, the  first North American video game studio to successfully unionize in partnership with CODE-CWA, had a four-day workweek before unionizing. Workers at Vodeo unionized in part to protect those sorts of benefits.</p><p>CODE-CWA是一家为动视暴雪（Activision Blizzard）等公司的工人提供帮助的工会，其竞选领袖艾玛·金马（Emma Kinema）指出，即使是最理想的Blackbird每周工作四天的安排，最终决定权和否决权仍然掌握在管理层手中。她接着指出，第一家与CODE-CWA合作成功成立工会的北美视频游戏工作室Vodeo在成立工会之前每周工作四天。Vodeo的工人加入工会部分是为了保护这些福利。</p><p> “Maybe today the bosses are friendly and have a policy you like, but what if circumstances change or there’s new management, or the company gets bought out or does a reorg?” Kinema said. “When the going gets tough — and eventually for all companies, for all industries, it does — it’s the workers’ interests, the workers’ work-life balances, that are going to be the first things out the window.”</p><p>“也许今天的老板很友好，有一套你喜欢的政策，但如果情况发生变化，或者有了新的管理层，或者公司被收购，或者进行了重组，该怎么办？”金马说。“当情况变得艰难时——最终对所有公司、所有行业来说都是如此——工人的利益、工人的工作和生活平衡将成为第一件被抛在脑后的事情。”</p><p>  Saleem Dabbous, studio director at a KO_OP, the worker-owned cooperative developing “Goodbye Volcano High” that  also has a four-day workweek, advocated for unionization even at relatively generous companies like Blackbird.</p><p>Ako_OP的工作室主任Saleem Dabbous是一家工人所有的合作社，开发“再见火山高中”，每周工作四天，他甚至在Blackbird等相对慷慨的公司倡导成立工会。</p><p> “The only way protections for workers will be placed and maintained is through a redistribution of power toward workers to control their own destiny — especially as business priorities shift, management changes through acquisitions, or management staff turnover can all disrupt pro-worker policies,” Dabbous said.</p><p>达布斯说：“保护工人的唯一办法是通过向工人重新分配权力来控制他们自己的命运——尤其是随着业务重点的转移、通过收购进行的管理层变革或管理人员更替都可能破坏亲工人的政策。”。</p><p> Blackbird CEO Cunningham told The Post that there’s been “a lot of sniffing around and knocking on the doors” when it comes to other companies trying to buy Blackbird, but currently, the studio’s not selling.</p><p>Blackbird首席执行官坎宁安（Cunningham）在接受《华盛顿邮报》采访时表示，当其他公司试图收购Blackbird时，“有很多人在四处嗅探和敲门”，但目前，该工作室没有出售。</p><p> As for unionization, McGuire said that the company “has never opposed unionization at the studio, nor would we,” and pointed to the fact that Shipbreaker’s narrative focuses on “a labor-led unionization effort at a space salvage company.”</p><p>至于工会组织，麦奎尔说，该公司“从未反对工作室的工会组织，我们也不会反对，”并指出，拆船者的叙述重点是“一家太空打捞公司由劳工领导的工会组织工作”</p><p> For the time being, Blackbird is committed to the four-day workweek and is in the process of transitioning all its teams. Those who participated in the test hope other game studios will take their findings to heart and attempt tests of their own. Hudson, once the four-day workweek’s biggest skeptic, is now an evangelist.</p><p>目前，Blackbird致力于每周工作四天，并正在将其所有团队进行转换。那些参与测试的人希望其他游戏工作室将他们的发现铭记在心，并尝试自己的测试。哈德逊曾经是每周工作四天的最大怀疑者，现在是一名福音传道者。</p><p> “I know there’s probably going to be a lot of folks in this industry who are ambivalent or even scared to make a change like this,” he said. “Just have faith that your team will make it work in a way that works for them, because that’s exactly what happened to us. … Just give it a shot. If it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work. You can always go back.”</p><p>“我知道这个行业可能会有很多人对这样的改变感到矛盾甚至害怕，”他说。“只要相信你的团队会以一种对他们有效的方式工作，因为这正是发生在我们身上的事情……试一试。如果它不起作用，它就不起作用。你可以随时回去。”</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/电子游戏/">#电子游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/工作室/">#工作室</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/game/">#game</a></button></div></div><div class="shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded clearfix"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm"><div><a target="_blank" href="/story/1072771.html"><img src="http://img2.diglog.com/img/2022/2/thumb_48c899ae546261e3d6be47e8f30c370e.png" class="img-fluid" onerror="this.style.display='none'"></a></div><div class="item_title"><a target="_blank" href="/story/1072771.html">不和谐是信息的黑洞</a></div><span class="my_story_list_date">2022-2-13 1:19</span></div><div class="col-sm"><div><a target="_blank" href="/story/1072745.html"><img src="http://img2.diglog.com/img/2022/1/thumb_7234b1548bc6464c285924d6228a0cc9.jpg" class="img-fluid" onerror="this.style.display='none'"></a></div><div class="item_title"><a target="_blank" href="/story/1072745.html">Take-2获得社交游戏开发商Zynga以12.7亿美元的交易</a></div><span class="my_story_list_date">2022-1-11 18:48</span></div><div class="col-sm"><div><a target="_blank" href="/story/1072619.html"><img src="http://img2.diglog.com/img/2022/1/thumb_64a5f78ebf9c6cf5cfbb4f1429c60163.png" class="img-fluid" onerror="this.style.display='none'"></a></div><div class="item_title"><a target="_blank" href="/story/1072619.html">LatencyFlex：减少游戏延迟的新方法</a></div><span class="my_story_list_date">2022-1-10 22:39</span></div><div class="col-sm"><div><a target="_blank" href="/story/1072580.html"><img src="http://img2.diglog.com/img/2022/1/thumb_393380c31d4b4acd43128612b654f279.png" class="img-fluid" onerror="this.style.display='none'"></a></div><div class="item_title"><a target="_blank" href="/story/1072580.html">NFT Fantasy：为什么 -
