One of those initiatives was the creation and testing of an automated ball and strike calling system (ABS). The goal of the tests was to validate whether ABS was able to make and consistently communicate the correct call to the umpire quickly enough for the umpire to make the call on the field without introducing a delay.</p><p>2019年初，主要联盟棒球宣布与大西洋联盟的职业棒球（ALPB）合作，以测试新的竞争规则，以观察潜在的未来规则变化和设备的影响。其中一项举措是自动球和罢工调用系统（ABS）的创建和测试。测试的目标是验证ABS是否能够使ABS能够快速地向裁判拨打正确的呼叫，以便裁判在不引入延迟的情况下在该领域进行呼叫。</p><p> The results of our work in 2019 confirmed the system was able to work with sufficient consistency, reliability, and responsiveness, which enabled us to look at expanding the system for the 2020 season. Unfortunately these efforts were put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With the resumption of the Minor Leagues and the ALPB in 2021, we are ready to start testing again. In this article, we will explain how ABS operates, review the system’s initial design and subsequent iterations, and preview some of the additional ABS changes and improvements slated for 2021.</p><p> 2019年我们工作的结果证实了该系统能够满足足够的一致性，可靠性和响应能力，使我们能够查看2020季节的扩展系统。不幸的是，由于Covid-19流行病，这些努力被搁置。恢复了2021年的未成年联盟和ALPB，我们准备再次开始测试。在本文中，我们将解释ABS如何运行，查看系统的初始设计和随后的迭代，并预览2021的其他ABS更改和改进。</p><p>  In today’s game, many broadcasters use either a “live” strike zone graphic projected directly above home plate or a standalone strike zone graphic elsewhere on the broadcast. A similar graphical representation of the strike zone is used in MLB’s Gameday product and the MLB App. In each case, the strike zone graphic depicts the pitch relative to the boundaries of the strike zone.</p><p>  在今天的游戏中，许多广播公司使用直接在主板上方的“直播”击打区域图形或广播的其他地方的独立击球区域图形。击打区域的类似图形表示用于MLB的GameDay产品和MLB应用程序。在每种情况下，击打区域图形描绘了相对于击打区域的边界的间距。</p><p> An example of these renderings can be seen below from one pitch in a 2019 game between the Detroit Tigers and the Boston Red Sox.</p><p> 下面可以从底特律老虎和波士顿红袜之间的2019年游戏中的一个音调来看出这些渲染的示例。</p><p>    While there is a slight delay between the catcher receiving a pitch and the pitch location appearing on-screen, the broadcast graphic consistently updates faster than the umpire makes their call. An example of this is below and illustrates the window that ABS operates in: there is a period of time where the relevant information about the pitch is known but the umpire has not yet made a call, which gives ABS an opportunity to make a determination and relay the call to the umpire.</p><p>    虽然在接收间距和出现在屏幕上出现的音调位置之间存在轻微延迟，但广播图形始终如时更新，而不是裁判呼叫。下面的一个例子如下，并说明了ABS所操作的窗口：有一段时间，其中有关节距的相关信息是已知的，但裁判尚未提出呼叫，这使得ABS成为确定和实现决定的机会传递给裁判的呼叫。</p><p>  The history of showing pitch locations on TV in near real-time granted us a conceptual baseline from which to work. Showing a live strike zone on air requires some basic ability to identify a broadcast-appropriate strike zone, determine the location of the ball within that space, and render each in a reasonably convincing manner.</p><p>  在近期实时展示电视上的音高位置的历史批准了我们一个概念的基线。在空中显示现场打击区域需要一些基本的能力来识别广播适当的击打区域，确定该空间内球的位置，并以合理的方式呈现。</p><p>  The primary inputs for ABS are the pitch arc — the path the ball takes as it proceeds from the pitcher to the catcher — and the location and dimensions of the strike zone. The pitch data generated by the MLB tracking system is composed of a set of polynomials describing the path the center of the ball travels through space in MLB’s standard coordinate system, where the y-axis points toward the pitcher’s mound from the back of home plate, the z-axis points directly up from the back of home plate, and the x-axis is orthogonal to the other two axes.</p><p>  ABS的主要输入是间距弧 - 球的路径从投球机进入捕集器时，以及打击区域的位置和尺寸。由MLB跟踪系统产生的间距数据由描述球的中心在MLB的标准坐标系中通过空间行进的路径组成的多项式组成，其中Y轴从家用板后部朝向投手的土堆点， Z轴直接从主板的背面点，X轴与其他两个轴正交。 </p><p> As soon as the pitch data has been generated by the tracking system, ABS uses that information and the current strike zone definition to determine whether the pitch is a strike. The strike zone definition has varied across different iterations of the ABS system, but as a general rule, ABS constructs a two-dimensional shape on the x/z plane at a specific depth and checks whether the ball intersects that shape. The ball is modeled as a circle centered at a point along the pitch arc with a radius of 1.45 inches as defined in Rule 3.01 of the Major League Rulebook. The result of the ball/strike evaluation is then relayed to the umpire; we’ll speak more on how that is done later in this post.</p><p>一旦跟踪系统生成音高数据，ABS使用该信息和当前的冲击区域定义来确定间距是否是击球。击打区域定义在ABS系统的不同迭代中变化，而是作为一般规则，ABS在特定深度处在X / Z平面上构造二维形状，并检查球是否与该形状相交。球被建模为以沿着音调弧形为中心的圆圈，半径为1.45英寸，如主要联赛规则本规则3.01所定义。然后将球/罢工评估的结果转发到裁判;我们将在此帖子稍后完成。</p><p>  The single most important requirement for ABS implementation is the accuracy of the pitch arc being generated. To this end, MLB performs ground-truth testing at every ballpark to evaluate the accuracy and precision of in-stadia tracking systems; the methodology for this was  well-covered in an MLB Technology Blog post by Clay Nunnally in December 2019.</p><p>  ABS实现的单一最重要的要求是产生俯仰弧的精度。为此，MLB在每个球场进行地面真理测试，以评估Stadia跟踪系统的准确性和精度; 2019年12月，粘土的MLB技术博客文章中的方法论是良好的。</p><p> Just as important as accuracy for ABS is latency. Currently, there is some intentional delay between when the pitch is received and when the umpire makes their call, which allows the umpire to take a brief moment to make their decision. That brief moment is the window in which ABS must consistently deliver a call to the umpire; anything longer than that and the umpire has to make the call themselves to avoid delaying the game.</p><p> 与ABS的准确性一样重要是延迟。目前，当收到音高以及裁判召集时，允许裁判措施的呼叫之间存在一些有意的延迟，这使得裁判措施是短暂的措施。短暂的时刻是ABS必须一致地向裁判拨打电话;任何时间超过那个，裁判员都必须让自己称为避免延迟游戏。</p><p> The other main constraint is tracking system reliability. In order to effectively standardize the called strike zone, it is not sufficient to quickly and accurately relay a ball/strike call to the umpire some of the time, or most of the time; that goal must be achieved all of the time. It would not matter that 50 percent of pitches are called instantaneously with perfect accuracy if some percentage of pitches are either not tracked at all, significantly delayed in producing a tracking result, or poorly tracked. MLB spends significant effort monitoring the tracking system to ensure it is producing timely and accurate results.</p><p> 另一个主要约束是跟踪系统可靠性。为了有效地标准化被称为击球区，不足以快速准确地中继球/打击到裁定裁判，或大部分时间;必须一直实现这个目标。如果根本不跟踪的一些百分比，则在完美的精度下，50％的间距瞬间瞬间调用，显着延迟产生跟踪结果，或跟踪不良。 MLB花费重大努力监控跟踪系统，以确保其及时生产效果。</p><p> Finally, there are some cases where, even in a game where ABS is operational, the umpire will make the final determination of a ball or a strike being called based on criteria other than the strike zone. ABS is specifically focused on the strike zone and the flight of the ball, so the umpire retains personal responsibility for judging the other criteria that help determine pitch outcomes, such as checked swings or catcher’s interference. Using ABS allows the umpire to be better focused on anything that would result in a decision without consideration for the actual pitch location.</p><p> 最后，存在一些情况，即使在ABS是可操作的游戏中，裁判员也将基于除击球区域以外的标准进行最终确定球或击球。 ABS专门专注于撞击区和球的飞行，因此裁判保留了判断其他有助于确定音高结果的其他标准的个人责任，例如检查的摇摆或捕手的干扰。使用ABS允许裁判更好地专注于任何导致决定的任何导致的任何事项，而不考虑实际的音高位置。</p><p>  After the Atlantic League’s partnership with MLB was announced in early 2019, MLB tracking systems were installed and ground truth tests were conducted at each Atlantic League venue during April and May of that year. Once systems were operational, ABS was tested by running the system in the background without attempting to use the system on-field at several venues to identify and correct any critical issues prior to full rollout of ABS in the second half of the 2019 Atlantic League season.</p><p>  在2019年初与MLB宣布的大西洋联盟的合作之后，安装了MLB跟踪系统，并在每个大西洋联盟场地在4月和那年5月进行了地面真理测试。一旦系统运行，通过在背景中运行系统而不尝试在几个场地运行系统的情况下测试ABS，以在2019年大西洋联盟的下半年在ABS全面推出之前识别和纠正任何关键问题。</p><p>     As each batter came to the plate, the operator updated the system to ensure the correct batter was selected; this information was relayed to MLB tracking servers so that the Field Data Collector (FDC) knew the correct strike zone to use when the next pitch was thrown. When the pitch was thrown, the MLB tracking system published pitch data to a publish-subscribe queue; FDC read that data from the queue, determined whether the pitch was a ball or strike, and published that result to a pub/sub topic along with any other data it was responsible for collecting and publishing. The operator console was responsible for receiving the message published to the topic, indicating the call to the ABS operator, and playing the appropriate audio file for that call. The audio-out port of the ABS operator’s laptop was wired to a walkie-talkie; when audio played, the walkie-talkie transmitted audio for the duration of the audio clip and then ceased transmission.</p><p>     由于每个面糊来到板时，操作员更新了系统以确保选择正确的击球手;此信息已转发到MLB跟踪服务器，以便现场数据收集器（FDC）知道当抛出下一个音调时使用的正确击球区域。抛出音调后，将MLB跟踪系统发布了TAPTIB数据到发布 - 订阅队列; FDC读取来自队列的数据，确定音高是否是球或罢工，并发布结果与Pub / sub主题一起与其负责收集和发布的任何其他数据。操作员控制台负责接收发布于主题的消息，指示对ABS运算符的调用，并播放该调用的相应音频文件。 ABS操作员笔记本电脑的音频射线港口已连接到携带舞会;当音频播放时，对讲机在音频剪辑的持续时间内传输音频，然后停止传输。 </p><p>  ABS was used in the Atlantic League for the second half of the 2019 season, but we spent the first half of the season proving feasibility, collecting feedback from players and umpires, and creating runbooks for in-stadium personnel. One early area of feedback was the height of the strike zone, and a second was the reliability of the call in the umpire’s ear.</p><p>2019年赛季下半年在大西洋联盟中使用了ABS，但我们在赛季的上半年证明了可行性，从球员和裁判员收集了反馈，并为体育场境内创建流程书。一个早期的反馈区域是击球区域的高度，第二个是裁判耳朵中呼叫的可靠性。</p><p> The ABS strike zone shape we tested in the Atlantic League was a strike zone top and bottom sourced from MLB’s Stats API, which has player-specific strike zones for players who have appeared in MLB games but otherwise uses default strike zones based on a player’s height. To evaluate the strike zone across the full depth of the plate, the strike zone was modeled as a series of two-dimensional shapes on the x/z plane at specific intervals, conforming to the outline of the plate. A pitch could be above the top of the zone at the front of the plate but descend far enough to intersect one of the shapes closer to the back of the plate. Players noted that this produced a taller strike zone than they expected.</p><p> 我们在大西洋联盟中测试的ABS罢工区形状是来自MLB统计数据的罢工区顶部和底部，其中具有出现在MLB游戏中的玩家的球员特定的击球区，但否则根据玩家的高度使用默认打击区域。为了评估横跨板的全深度的撞击区，以特定间隔以特定间隔在X / Z平面上建模的击打区域以特定的间隔为模拟，符合板的轮廓。球场可以高于板的前部的区域顶部，但下降得足以将其中一个形状与靠近板的后部相交。玩家指出，这产生了比他们预期的更高的打击区。</p><p> During initial testing, the design of the walkie-talkie system caused occasional delays in getting the call to the umpire. A number of alternatives were tested, but over time it became clear that a modified off-the-shelf walkie-talkie transmission consistently added an unacceptable amount of latency to the system and a different approach for relaying the call to the umpire would be necessary.</p><p> 在初始测试期间，对讲机系统的设计导致偶尔延迟延迟到裁判呼叫。测试了许多替代方案，但随着时间的推移，清楚的是，修改的离心对讲机传输一致地增加了对系统的不可接受的延迟，并且需要一种用于将判断呼叫中继的不同方法。</p><p> For the first live-game use at the 2019 Atlantic League All Star Game in York, PA, we replaced the walkie-talkie system with an iPhone which the umpire wore on their belt. To play the sound in the umpire’s ear, we used an AirPod wireless earbud so the umpire did not need to be wired up to a device.</p><p> 对于2019年大西洋联盟的第一个直播游戏，PA，我们用裁判在腰带上穿着iPhone取代了对讲机系统。为了在裁判的耳朵里发出声音，我们使用了Airpod无线耳塞，因此裁判不需要连接到设备。</p><p> We leveraged the iPhone’s browser and created a simple browser application that listened to the messages broadcast by FDC over a publish-subscribe topic; upon receipt, the appropriate call would play in the umpire’s earpiece. This removed the walkie-talkie transmission latency, and while overall system performance did improve there were still intermittent delays of one to two seconds for umpires to hear the ABS call.</p><p> 我们利用了iPhone的浏览器，并创建了一个简单的浏览器应用程序，该应用程序听到了FDC在发布 - 订阅主题上广播的消息;收到后，适当的呼叫将在裁判员的耳机中发挥作用。这删除了对讲机传输延迟，而整体系统性能确实改善仍然有一到两秒的间歇延迟，以便审查ABS通话。</p><p> We found the AirPod worked sufficiently well in our testing, but umpires voiced concerns over earbuds falling out when removing their mask or becoming gradually unseated from their ear during play due to sweat, movement, etc. Due to that feedback, we migrated back to a wired security earpiece that connected to the iPhone, with multiple sizes of silicone earbud sleeves to better fit each umpire’s ear. Migrating back from a Bluetooth headphone to a wired one also removed an additional source of latency.</p><p> 我们发现Airpod在我们的测试中充分努力工作，但裁判员对耳塞时的担忧掉了出来的耳朵，或者由于汗水，运动等因汗水，运动等而从他们的耳朵逐渐取消而逐渐取消。我们迁移回A连接到iPhone的有线安全耳机，具有多种尺寸的硅胶耳塞袖，以更好地贴合每个裁判的耳朵。从蓝牙耳机向有线迁移，还删除了额外的延迟来源。</p><p>  For the 2019 AFL season, we made a few important updates. First, the MLB tracking system at Salt River Field was identical to the ones used in all thirty Major League ballparks in 2018 and 2019. In addition, we updated how we used the iOS devices in order to address the intermittent latencies that were noted in the Atlantic League sites. We stuck with the wired earpiece as that was overwhelmingly favored by umpires.</p><p>  在2019年的AFL赛季，我们提出了一些重要的更新。首先，盐河领域的MLB跟踪系统与2018年和2019年的所有三十大联盟球场中使用的MLB跟踪系统相同。此外，我们更新了我们如何使用IOS设备以解决所注明的间歇性延迟大西洋联盟网站。我们坚持有线耳机，因为这是由裁判员压倒性的压倒性。 </p><p> To address the intermittent latency when ABS ran in the iOS browser, we developed a dedicated application that performed the same functions as the web app. Switching to a dedicated app eliminated the client-side delays we had seen with earlier approaches and consistently delivered the ball or strike determination to the umpire’s ear on-time.</p><p>为了解决IS浏览器中ABS中的间歇延迟，我们开发了一个专用应用程序，该应用程序执行与Web应用程序相同的功能。切换到专用应用程序消除了我们以前看过的客户端延迟，并始终向裁判的耳朵交付球或罢工决定。</p><p> With these results in hand, we were confident that we had sufficiently addressed operational issues and were ready to scale up the system for broader use.</p><p> 通过这些结果，我们有信心我们充分解决了运营问题，并准备扩大系统以进行更广泛的使用。</p><p>  Taking into account the progress made in 2019, MLB determined that ABS is ready to be taken to additional leagues and parks in preparation for possible use at the highest levels of Minor and Major League Baseball. Like everyone else, ABS needs to work its way up to “The Show”! Therefore, in addition to the Atlantic League, we have installed ABS at several venues in the Low-A Southeast League.</p><p>  考虑到2019年的进展，MLB确定ABS已准备好被带到额外联盟和公园，以准备在最高级别的未成年联盟棒球队的使用。像其他人一样，ABS需要努力达到“展示”！因此，除了大西洋联盟之外，我们还在低落的东南联盟的几个场地安装了ABS。</p><p> The major benefit of testing ABS in the Low-A Southeast League is that several of these venues have also been equipped with the latest revisions of MLB tracking technology, so ABS’ overall system design in these venues will more closely mimic what the system would be in Major League ballparks.</p><p> 在低于东南联盟中测试ABS的主要好处是，这些场地中的几个也配备了MLB跟踪技术的最新修订，因此ABS在这些场地的整体系统设计将更加密切地模仿系统的内容在主要联盟球场。</p><p>  All in all, 2019 was an amazing year for the team that designed, developed, and operated ABS. Engineers from across the MLB Technology organization and members of MLB’s Baseball Operations teams banded together to make this project a reality, going from concept to live in-game use in less than five months. In recognition of the effort, the MLB team was recognized with the 2019  SportTechie Award for Innovation of the Year for ABS’ potential to “transform the governance of baseball’s most fundamental interaction”.</p><p>  总而言之，2019年为设计，开发和经营的ABS的团队来说是一个很棒的一年。来自MLB技术组织的工程师和MLB的棒球运营团队成员共同制作这个项目的现实，从概念到少于五个月的游戏中使用。为了认识到努力，MLB团队通过2019年的Sporttechie奖获得了ABS潜力的2019年的创新奖“改变了棒球最基本的互动的治理”。</p><p> Despite losing the opportunity to test in 2020 due to COVID-19, the team is ready to continue testing the system in the Low-A Southeast League and the Atlantic League this spring. Our goals for the year are to validate system performance and reliability across a larger number of games and make refinements to our design where necessary to harden the design for all ballpark conditions. We look forward to further exploring how ABS and other technologies can enhance the game on the field for the greater enjoyment of all who follow the sport.</p><p> 尽管失去了2020年由于Covid-19在2020年测试的机会，但该团队已准备好在今年春天在低地东南联盟和大西洋联盟中测试系统。我们今年的目标是验证大量游戏中的系统性能和可靠性，并在必要时为我们的设计进行改进，以解决所有球场条件的设计。我们期待进一步探索ABS和其他技术如何在田野上增强游戏，以便更加享受所有遵循这项运动的人。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://technology.mlblogs.com/developing-mlbs-automated-ball-strike-system-abs-d4f499deff31">https://technology.mlblogs.com/developing-mlbs-automated-ball-strike-system-abs-d4f499deff31</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/开发/">#开发</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/mlb/">#mlb</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/abs/">#abs</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
