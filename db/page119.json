The vast majority of brain imaging studies so far have focused on qualitative, gross pathology of moderate to severe cases, often carried out on hospitalised patients. It remains unknown however whether the impact of COVID-19 can be detected in milder cases, in a quantitative and automated manner, and whether this can reveal a possible mechanism for the spread of the disease. UK Biobank scanned over 40,000 participants before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, making it possible to invite back in 2021 hundreds of previously-imaged participants for a second imaging visit. Here, we studied the effects of the disease in the brain using multimodal data from 782 participants from the UK Biobank COVID-19 re-imaging study, with 394 participants having tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection between their two scans. We used structural and functional brain scans from before and after infection, to compare longitudinal brain changes between these 394 COVID-19 patients and 388 controls who were matched for age, sex, ethnicity and interval between scans. We identified significant effects of COVID-19 in the brain with a loss of grey matter in the left parahippocampal gyrus, the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the left insula. When looking over the entire cortical surface, these results extended to the anterior cingulate cortex, supramarginal gyrus and temporal pole. We further compared COVID-19 patients who had been hospitalised (n=15) with those who had not (n=379), and while results were not significant, we found comparatively similar findings to the COVID-19 vs control group comparison, with, in addition, a greater loss of grey matter in the cingulate cortex, central nucleus of the amygdala and hippocampal cornu ammonis (all |Z|&gt;3). Our findings thus consistently relate to loss of grey matter in limbic cortical areas directly linked to the primary olfactory and gustatory system. Unlike in  post hoc disease studies, the availability of pre-infection imaging data helps avoid the danger of pre-existing risk factors or clinical conditions being mis-interpreted as disease effects. Since a possible entry point of the virus to the central nervous system might be via the olfactory mucosa and the olfactory bulb, these brain imaging results might be the  in vivo hallmark of the spread of the disease (or the virus itself) via olfactory and gustatory pathways.\n    This work was primarily supported by a Wellcome Trust Collaborative Award 215573/Z/19/Z.

A disease colloquially referred to as The Sick spreads rapidly among humans while overwhelming infrastructure, grinding daily life to a halt, and racking up a body count.\u00a0When this story begins, society tries to put itself together again. An unnamed narrator calls it &#34;The Great Crumble.&#34;\n This disaster, however, can&#39;t be contained even to the extent of COVID-19. No cure or vaccination has been discovered, so most humans opt to live in isolation either as individuals or as disease-free groups. This withdrawal has allowed nature to essentially step into the void\u2014animals previously only seen in a zoo roam free, and landscapes grow out in full to replenish what society previously destroyed for resources.\n Oh, and in  Sweet Tooth,\u00a0the\u00a0next generation of kids appears to include half-animal/half-human individuals called Hybrids. The ratio of column A to column B varies\u2014some talk, some don&#39;t; many look like traditional kids with small animal features; all retain abilities like heightened hearing or smell\u2014but no one seems to know anything for sure . Why did this evolution happen? How many are there? And, most pertinent, what makes Hybrids immune to The Sick? In the face of all that mystery, some portions of this new world look at Hybrids as a hopeful evolution of humanity, a group of individuals society should protect and help thrive. Others, though, see Hybrids as a hindrance to humanity getting past The Sick and returning to normalcy. In particular, Hybrids&#39; immunity to The Sick has swaths of this new world curious about whether their DNA can be harvested for treatment or prevention.\n In the middle of this whole mess sits Gus, a deerboy Hybrid who simply lived a quiet life in an isolated Yellowstone cabin with his father until, well, you can probably see where this is headed. Luckily, that predictability doesn&#39;t make the journey ahead any less fun.\n     So, our\u00a0 Tom Sawyer-loving deerkid has to set off on a country-traversing adventure of his own, and throughout, he&#39;ll encounter numerous individuals with unknown motives who may want him dead or may partner up to become a  found family of sorts. I watched a large portion of the series with a teen sibling, and needless to say they were able to call out many of the individual episode&#39;s twists and turns.\u00a0 Sweet Tooth\u00a0covers  a lot of well-worn movie and TV territory, but it will still likely have you in for the long haul if you&#39;re fond of any of the numerous kids-versus-the-world adventures of yore (from\u00a0 The Goonies\u00a0to\u00a0 Harry Potter).\n    That said, I was amused by the series&#39; unique approach to some common aspects of its intersecting genres (kid adventure, post-apocalypse). When Gus and his first new partymate (a former football player turned hunter/assassin named Tommy Jeppard, aka Big Man) inevitably encounter a militarized group of people, that community\u00a0 isn&#39;t\u00a0full of former cadets or marines. Instead, this amateur army learned its tactics because they were previously a devoted group of friends who played games like\u00a0 Overwatch\u00a0or\u00a0 Halo.\u00a0And the scientists who remain and must sort out this disease mess aren&#39;t former government lab jockeys; they used to be regular-old medical care providers. They very much continue to grapple with the trauma of watching all these patients of The Sick deteriorate as this new world asks them to step up and lead, so these docs have their humanity in tact rather than operating only with some &#34;anything for the greater good&#34; mentality.\n  It would be very, very easy for\u00a0 Sweet Tooth\u00a0to become too dark, too emotionally heavy, or too tiresome for viewers who have lived some of this stuff IRL in the last 16 months. Again and again, the show gave me flashbacks to when I used to follow\u00a0  The Walking Dead , which I had quit watching\u00a0entirely after hours and hours of despair. Like  TWD,  Sweet Tooth\u00a0has our heroes going through cycles where they encounter many different groups of people who initially seem nice and helpful only to reveal themselves to be something else later on, often with tragic results. (When will people in TV and film learn that there may be no scarier, more dangerous place than white picket fence-lined suburban neighborhoods?  Sigh.)\u00a0In another notable zombie-brains-show similarity, the bad guys (whether that&#39;s a disease or a disassociated lunatic military man) seem to come out on top more often than not, at least in these first eight episodes.\n Despite that,  Sweet Tooth\u00a0never veers entirely into ruin porn or nihilism. Mostly, that&#39;s because of its central figure. Unlike Rick Grimes ( The Walking Dead), June (  Handmaid&#39;s Tale), or many other characters existing in an apocalyptic new reality,\u00a0Gus is still a kid. The world hasn&#39;t beaten him down into expecting the worst all the time, and his general optimism and wonder keep this story feeling light enough despite many gut punches along the way.\u00a0 Sweet Tooth&#39;s source comic wrapped in 2013, and production on this Netflix series  began long before COVID-19 took over. The creative team had already made a few decisions to tone down the bleakness of the source material, and the benefits of\u00a0those choices are only amplified by the context viewers bring to the show in summer 2021.\n    I have yet to actively seek out any pandemic-related pop culture. Maybe my appetite for it will eventually change, though let&#39;s revisit that in a decade.\u00a0But given how all-encompassing this ongoing global situation has been, of course you can&#39;t help but consume some of it, even by accident. For me, the stuff that works so far has had some degree of optimism or hope underneath the adversity, chaos, and tragedy. The risotto episode of   How to With John Wilson, for instance, includes overrun grocery stores and scenes from hospitals, but it ends by underscoring our need for human interaction and the newly realized immense value in it.\n On the surface,  Sweet Tooth isn&#39;t about the pandemic at all. This show is for teens, and it is not subtle about hammering home a central idea regarding humanity&#39;s role in destroying our planet through climate change and an insatiable thirst for more. However, the show&#39;s plot prominently features a worldwide pandemic, making it impossible to not think about that through the lens of these eight episodes. Ultimately,  Sweet Tooth\u00a0points to a few positive messages amid the disease darkness.\n First, don&#39;t be jerks to the youngest generation. We don&#39;t yet know how this will impact them, and they are the future who will unravel this mess and navigate its lasting impact. Additionally, pushing forward necessitates extending kindness to others. The weight of the world is emotionally on everyone&#39;s shoulders (if not physically, to a large extent). And when it&#39;s impossible to know when your next event, trip, family reunion, or whatever thing you look forward to will happen, some other kind of hope must exist for you to believe in if you want any chance at emotional and mental survival. Gus gives that hope to admittedly broken-down individuals like Big Man, and it&#39;s easy to imagine him spreading that optimistic outlook wider in S2 given the pessimistic way things wrap this time around.\n Traditionally, summer always felt like\u00a0a dumping ground for networks to try unusual things as people vacation or generally get out more; bigger series headliners tend to wait for fall returns or premieres accordingly (see   Y: The Last Man\u00a0or\u00a0  The Foundation\u00a0in 2021). But recent years have seen surprises emerge at the end of spring and become their own critical darlings (HBO&#39;s\u00a0  Los Espookys) or megafranchises (  Stranger Things). Whether\u00a0 Sweet Tooth\u00a0can travel the same surprise path to stardom remains to be seen, but it&#39;s at least nice to have a new show worth following as we enter another summer where travel might be complicated (though, mercifully, not as complicated as it is in  Sweet Tooth).", "posttime": "2021-06-20 21:52:37", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5145\u6ee1\u5e0c\u671b,tooth,\u751c\u98df", "title": "\u751c\u98df\u662f\u5145\u6ee1\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u540e\u671f\u7684\u7968\u4ef7 - \u4f46\u8981\u6ce8\u610f\u5b83\u7684\u884c\u8d70\u7684\u6b7b\u4eba\u6c1b\u56f4 ", "title_en": "Sweet Tooth is hopeful post-apocalyptic fare\u2014but beware its Walking Dead vibes", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/sweet-tooth-is-hopeful-post-apocalyptic-fare-but-beware-its-walking-dead-vibes/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5145\u6ee1\u5e0c\u671b", "tooth", "\u751c\u98df"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "616bcf9b1e3489cbb30a1f698bb931d1.png", "infoid": 1067036, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "@VM_CALL\uff1a\u5c06\u6211\u7684\u4e2a\u4ebawifi\u4e0essid\u201c\uff05p\uff05s\uff05s\uff05s\uff05s\uff05n\u201d\u52a0\u5165\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u7684iPhone\u6c38\u4e45\u7981\u7528\u5b83\u662fWiFi\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u65e2\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u542f\u52a8\u4e5f\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8SSID\u4fee\u590d\u5b83\uff1a\u301c\uff09\n  \u73b0\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684SSID\u8bbe\u7f6e\u70ed\u70b9\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6211\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bbe\u5907\u52a0\u5165\uff0cWifid\u5373\u5c06\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\n  \u7ebf\u7a0b2\u540d\uff1a\u8c03\u5ea6\u961f\u5217\uff1acom.apple.wifid.managerQueueThread 2\u6bc1\u635f\uff1a0 libsystem_platform.dylib 0x00000001ebcb9724 _platform_strlen + 41\u7684CoreFoundation 0x00000001a381d84c __CFStringAppendFormatCore + 88122\u7684CoreFoundation 0x00000001a381efa8 _CFStringCreateWithFormatAndArgumentsReturningMetadata + 1603 WiFiPolicy 0x00000001d0895f8c  -  [WFLogger WFLog\uff1a\u6d88\u606f\uff1a] + 1924 ???

Using a quantum trick with light has allowed researchers to examine living cells in unprecedented detail without destroying them, a technique that could improve medical diagnoses and microbiology research.\n The microscopes that are generally used to examine living biological systems shine one or two bright lights on their targets, and\u00a0more powerful light sources allow researchers to see the cells in greater detail. But this approach has\u00a0 a fundamental limit to the precision it can achieve: at some point, a bright enough light will destroy a living cell.\n \u201cOur understanding of life as it is now has relied almost entirely on the quality of our microscopes,\u201d says  Warwick Bowen at the University of Queensland in Australia. \u201cWe\u2019re really limited by technology, and it\u2019s not obvious how to break the existing limits because we\u2019ve already pushed the intensity as high as we can without destroying the cell.\u201d\n  Bowen and his colleagues have found a way to overcome this problem. They used a type of microscope with two laser light sources, but sent one of the beams through a specially designed crystal that \u201csqueezes\u201d the light. It does so by introducing  quantum correlations in the photons \u2013 the particles of light in the laser beam.\n The photons were coupled into correlated pairs, and any of them that had energies unlike the others were discarded instead of being paired off. That process lowered the intensity of the beam while decreasing its noise, which allowed for more precise imaging.\n  When the researchers tested their system, they found that they were able to make measurements that were 35 per cent sharper than a similar device that didn\u2019t use squeezed light.\n  \u201cIn order to achieve this kind of measurement without quantum correlations, you\u2019d have to turn the intensity up,\u201d says Bowen. \u201cBut if you turned up the intensity enough to match these results, you\u2019d destroy the sample, so we\u2019re able to examine things that previously would have been impossible to see.\u201d\n These included the wall of a yeast cell ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which is about 10 nanometres thick, as well as the fluid within a cell, both of which would be faint even with the best non-quantum microscopes, and completely invisible\u00a0with standard microscopes. Observing these  minuscule parts of living tissues could help us understand the basics of life at the smallest scales.\n \u201cThis is a very exciting advance in the field of optical microscopy that opens the door for improving how state-of-the-art microscopes can work, at light intensities that are right at the threshold of damaging biological samples,\u201d says Frank Vollmer at the University of Exeter in the UK.\n Quantum microscopes will also have practical applications, Bowen says. For example, light-based microscopes are often used to  determine if cells are cancerous or to diagnose other diseases, and squeezed light could significantly improve the sensitivity of those tests as well as speeding them up, he says.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 21:09:09", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u663e\u5fae\u955c,microscope", "title": "\u91cf\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u4e2d\u68c0\u67e5\u7ec6\u80de ", "title_en": "Quantum microscope can examine cells in unprecedented detail", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/2280216-quantum-microscope-can-examine-cells-in-unprecedented-detail/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u663e\u5fae\u955c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067028, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u56fe1\uff1a\u540d\u4e3amakefile\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002 \u5bf9\u4e8e\u6559\u80b2\u5185\u5bb9\u7684Smidgeon\uff0c\u8bf7\u6ce8\u610f\u4f7f\u7528$ EUID\uff08\u6709\u6548\u7528\u6237ID\uff09\u800c\u4e0d\u662f$ UID\uff08\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u7528\u6237ID\uff09\u3002 \u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5373\u5927\u591a\u6570\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237ID\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u77ed\u7684\u540d\u79f0\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7528\u6237ID\u51e0\u4e4e\u603b\u662f\u662f\u60a8\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u3002 \u67e5\u770b\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u5173\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6458\u8981\u3002  \u3002\u524d\u9762\uff1a\u6211\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\u3002 \u6211\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\u3002 \u6211\u662f\u6211\u7b54\uff1a@\u771f\u5939\u82af\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\uff1a@ test $$ euid -ne 0\uff06amp;\uff06amp;\uff06amp; echo\uff06\uff0334;\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f \u8ba9\u5b83\u81ea\u5df1\u3002\uff06\uff0334; || \u56de\u58f0\uff06\uff0334;\u597d\u7684\u3002\uff06\uff0334; \u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\uff1a@ test $$ euid -ne 0\uff06amp;\uff06amp;\uff06amp; echo\uff06\uff0334;\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f \u8ba9\u5b83\u81ea\u5df1\u3002\uff06\uff0334; || \u56de\u58f0\uff06\uff0334;\u597d\u7684\u3002\uff06\uff0334;  \u6ce8\u91ca\uff1f \u95ee\u9898\uff1f \u66f4\u6b63\uff1f \u5982\u679c\u60a8\u60f3\u4e0e\u6211\u8054\u7cfb\u6b64\u5e16\u5b50\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u8bf7\u5728ME\u53d1\u9001\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u81f3me@chrismorgan.info\u3002 ", "note_en": "Figure\u00a01: contents of a file named  Makefile.

All that matters is what other people see in it and what buyers are willing to pay.  The 2020\u2019s equivalent of Warhol paintings are  Non-Fungible-Tokens (NFTs). In this essay I\u2019ll explain what NFTs are by motivating them with some interesting real-world problems. Then I\u2019ll discuss why the NFT craze for digital art generates so much ideologically contentious debate. Finally, I\u2019ll discuss some parallels between artistic and financial nihilism, and how this might serve as a framework for thinking about wildly speculative markets.     Suppose you want to buy a Birkin bag or some other luxury brand item. An unauthorized seller \u2014 perhaps someone who needs some emergency cash \u2014 is willing to sell you a Birkin bag. They offer you a good discount, relative to the price the authorized retailer would charge you. But how can you be sure they aren\u2019t selling you a fake? Counterfeits for these items are very high quality, and the average Birkin customer probably can\u2019t tell the difference between a real and a fake.   One way to avoid counterfeits is to only purchase items from an authorized retailer, e.g. a trusted Herm\u00e8s store. But this is not practical because it prevents people from selling or giving away their bags. If you leave your bag to someone in your will, then its authenticity is no longer guaranteed.  So we have the market need: how does a seller pass on or sell a luxury item? How does a buyer ensure that they are buying an authentic item?  One possible answer is for Herm\u00e8s to print out a list of secret serial numbers, perhaps sewn inside the bag, that declare whether a bag is legit or not. Owners receive a serial number when they buy the bag. But this is not a strong deterrent. A counterfeiter could just buy a real bag and then copy its serial number into many fake bags.  What if Herm\u00e8s maintains a public website of who owns which bag? Any time a bag changes ownership, this ledger needs to be updated. By recording a unique owner for each unique serial number, this solves the problem of counterfeiters simply duplicating serial numbers. The process shifts from verifying properties to verifying transactions and owners.  These approaches would work, but has a centralized point of failure: If the Herm\u00e8s website goes down, nobody can trade bags anymore. Herm\u00e8s is a big company and has the resources to protect their website against DDOS attacks and other cybersecurity threat vectors, but smaller luxury brands might not have a state-of-the-art security department. If they are not careful, their security could be breached by hackers or an unscrupulous sysadmin. Also, if Herm\u00e8s stops operating as a company in 25 years, who will maintain the ledger of ownership? If it is a third party company, can we trust them not to abuse that power? Even in the unlikely event that the central point of failure never makes a mistake, it\u2019s still mildly annoying to require Herm\u00e8s to get involved every time a bag changes hands.   What if you could verify transactions and owners, without a centralized party? This is where Non-Fungible Tokens, or NFTs, come in. In 2009, someone  published a landmark paper on how to build a decentralized ledger of who owns what. This ledger is called a &#34;blockchain&#34;. A blockchain is a record of the consensus state of the world, following some agreed-upon protocol that is known to everyone. The remarkable thing about blockchains is that they are decentralized (no central point of failure), and resilient to malicious actors in the network.-Distributed consensus is reached by each individual contributing some resource like money, hash rate, or computer storage. So long as a large fraction of resources in the network are controlled by well-behaved actors, the integrity of the blockchain remains secure. The fraction required typically varies from one-thirds to just over a half.   There are many blockchains out there. The details of how their consensus protocols are implemented are fascinating but beyond the scope of this essay. The important thing to know is that the base technology underlying NFTs and cryptocurrencies is a formal protocol that allows people to come to an agreement on who owns what without having to involve a trusted third party (e.g. Herm\u00e8s, an escrow agent, your bank, or your government). Theoretically speaking, blockchains allow shared consensus in a trustless society.  NFTs are like a paper deed of ownership, but instead of paper the certificate is digital. And unlike a paper deed an NFT cannot be forged. NFTs contain a unique \u201cserial number\u201d that is publicly viewable, but only one person can be said to \u201cpossess\u201d that serial number on the blockchain, much like how home addresses are public but registered to a single owner by the recording office. To see how NFTs solve the Birkin bag counterfeit problem, let\u2019s suppose Herm\u00e8s publicly declares the following for all to hear:   \u201cOwners of True Birkin bags will be issued a digital certificate of authenticity represented by an NFT\u201d  As a buyer, you can be quite confident that the bag is authentic if the seller also owns the NFT, and you can verify that the NFT was indeed originally created by Herm\u00e8s by looking up its public transaction history. During a transaction, the seller simply gives the buyer the bag and tells the blockchain to re-assign ownership of the NFT to the buyer\u2019s digital identifier. If the payment is done in cryptocurrency, the escrow can even be performed  using a smart contract without a centralized party (the seller publishes contract \u201cIf a specific buyer\u2019s wallet address sends me X USDC in 24 hours, send the NFT is sent to them and send the cash to me.\u201d)  NFTs provide the means to implement digital scarcity, but there still needs to be a way to pair it with a real-world item in the \u201canalog\u201d world. A seller could still bypass the security of NFTs by selling you an NFT with a fake Birkin bag. However, for every fake bag you want to sell, you need to purchase a real NFT and the real bag that comes with it. After you sell the NFT with the fake bag, you are left with a real bag with no NFT! Subsequently, the market value of the real bag drops because buyers will be highly suspicious of a seller who says &#34;this is a real bag, I don&#39;t have the NFT because I just sold it with a fake bag.&#34; While NFTs are not sure proof of a physical Birkin bag&#39;s authenticity, they all but ruin the economic incentives of counterfeiting.   What about luxury consumable goods? You could buy NFT-certified Wagyu beef, sell the NFT with some cheaper steak, and then eat the real Wagyu beef - it doesn\u2019t matter what other people think you&#39;re eating. However, NFT transactions are public, so a grocery shopper would be quite suspicious of a food NFT that has changed hands outside of the typical supply chain addresses. For NFTs paired with physical goods, each \u201cunusual\u201d transaction significantly adds to counterfeit risk, which diminishes the economic incentives to counterfeiters. This is especially true for consumable, perishable goods.  Authenticity is useful, even outside of Veblen goods. You can imagine using NFTs to implement anonymous digital identity verification ( a 30B market by 2024), or ship it with food products like meat where the customer cares a lot about the provenance of the product. In Taiwan, there is a current ongoing scandal where a bunch of US-imported pork has been passed off as \u201cdomestic pork\u201d and nobody can trust their butchers anymore.   In the most general case, NFTs can be used to implement provenance tracking of both physical and digital assets - an increasingly important need in our modern age of disinformation. Where did this photo of a politician come from? Who originally produced this audio clip?     NFTs make a lot of sense for protecting the authenticity of luxury goods or implementing single sign-on or tracking the provenance of meat products, but that\u2019s not what they\u2019re primarily used for today. Rather, most people sell NFTs for digital art. Here are some early examples of art NFTs, called \u201cCryptopunks\u201d. Each punk is a 24x24 RGB image.  One of these recently sold for 17M USD in an auction. At first glance, this is perplexing. The underlying digital content - some pixels stored in a file - are freely accessible to anyone. Why would anyone pay so much for a certificate of authenticity on something that anyone can enjoy for free? Is the buyer the one that gets punked?\n It\u2019s easy to dismiss this behavior as poor taste colliding with the arbitrarily large disposable income of rich people, in particular crypto millionaires that swap crypto assets with other crypto millionaires. While this may be true, I think it\u2019s far more interesting to ask \u201cwhat worldview would cause a rational person to bet $17M on a certificate for a 24x24x3 set of pixel values\u201d?   Historically, the lion\u2019s share of rewards for digital content has been owned by distribution technology like Spotify or content aggregators like Facebook, and then split with the management company. The creatives themselves are paid pittances, and do not share in the financialization of their labor. The optimist case for NFT art is as follows: NFTs are decentralized, which means any artist with an internet connection can draw up financial contracts for their art on their own terms. If NFTs revolutionize the business model of digital art, and if the future of art is mostly digital, then the first art NFTs to ever be issued might accrue significant cultural relevance, and that\u2019s why they command such high speculative prices.   Valuing art based on cultural relevance might be a bit absurd, but why is the Mona Lisa \u201cThe Mona Lisa\u201d? da Vinci arguably made \u201cbetter\u201d paintings from a technical standpoint. It&#39;s because of intangible value. The Mona Lisa is valuable because of its cultural proximity to important events and people in history, and the mimetic desire of other humans. In fact, it was a relatively obscure painting until 1911, when it was stolen from the Louvre and became a source of national shame overnight.   All art, from your child\u2019s first finger painting, to an antique heirloom passed down generations, to a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d like the Mona Lisa, are valued this way. They are valuable simply because others deem it valuable.   NFTs are the digital equivalent of buying a  banana duck-taped to a wall; you are betting that in the future, that statement of ownership on some blockchain will be historically significant, which you can presumably trade in for cash or clout or both. But buyer beware: things get philosophically tricky when applying the theory of \u201cintangible value\u201d to digital information and artwork where the cost of replication goes to zero.   I can think of two ways to look at how one values NFTs for digital art. One perspective is that in a world full of fake Birkin bags and products sourced from ethically dubious places, the only thing of value is the certificate of authenticity. The cultural and mimetic value of content has transferred entirely to the provenance certificate, and not the pixels themselves (which can be copied for free). If art\u2019s value is derived from the cultural relevance it represents and its proximity to important people, then the most sensible way to make high art would not be to improve one\u2019s painting skills, but to schmooze with a lot of famous people and insert oneself into important events in history, and issue scarce status symbols for the bourgeoisie. Warhol did exactly that.\u00a0  The alternate view is that if a perfect copy can be made of some pixels, then it is not really a counterfeit at all, and therefore the NFT secures nothing of actual value. Is it meaningful to ascribe a certificate of authenticity to something that can be perfectly replicated? Is \u201cauthenticity\u201d of a stream of 0s and 1s meaningless? There is certainly utility in verifying the source of some information, but anyone can mint an NFT for the same information.  In summary, the Pro-NFT crowd values the intangible \u201ccollector\u2019s scarcity and cultural relevance\u201d. The anti-NFT focuses on tangible value - how much real value does this secure? Both are reasonable frameworks to value things, and you can end up with wildly different conclusions.\n  Convince enough people that a urinal is valuable, and it becomes an investment grade asset. This is no longer merely a matter of art philosophy - when you invest in an index fund, you are essentially reinforcing the market\u2019s current belief of valuations. When people bid up the price of TSLA or GME to stratospheric valuations, the index fund must re-adjust their market-weighted holdings to reflect those prices, creating further money inflows to the asset and thus a  self-fulfilling prophecy. As it turns out, the art-of-investing is much like investing-in-art. As I have suggested in the title of this essay and borrowed from Warhol (who probably borrowed it from Marshall McLuhan),\u00a0 stonks are what you can get away with.\n    We are starting to see this valuation framework being applied to the equities market today, where price movements are dominated by narratives about where the price is going and what other people are willing to pay for it, especially with meme stocks like GME and AMC. Many retail investors don\u2019t really care about whether GME\u2019s price is justified by their corporate earnings - they simply buy at any cost. This financial nihilism - where intrinsic value is unknowable and all that matters is what other people think - is a worldview often encountered in Gen Z retail traders and a surprising number of professional traders I know. Perhaps the  midwit meme is really true.  This is definitely a cause for some concern, but at the same time, I think value investors should keep an open mind that what first seems like irrational behavior might have a method to madness. If you have an irrational force acting in the markets, like shareholders who refuse to sell or lend their stock, a discounted cash flow model for AMC or GME starts to not become very predictive of share price. By reflexivity, that will have impacts on future cash flows! In a similar fashion, using present-day frameworks for thinking about business and value do not account for the disruptive force of technology. That\u2019s why I find NFTs so fascinating - they are an intersection of finance, art, technology, and the nihilistic framework of valuation that is so prevalent in our society today.\u00a0  What is rational behavior for an investor, anyway? Is it \u201cstandard behavior\u201d as measured against the population average? How do you tell apart standard behavior from a collective delusion?

Seafood or intelligent marine life?\n A group of Conservative MPs think it&#39;s the latter and argue they should be included in a law to protect animals.\n The Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill recognises animal sentience - which is the capacity of animals to have feelings, including pain and suffering.\n It currently says fish, and other vertebrates which feel pain, should be protected as much as possible.\n Animals like lobsters and octopus are not currently protected by the bill because as invertebrates, their body is different to ours, so they aren&#39;t thought to have those complex feelings, says a report by the  Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation (CAWF).\n  The report says arguments against recognising these species focuses on physical differences between these animals and humans - but this fails to understand what it means for an animal to have feelings.\n   It says those species &#34;undoubtedly experience the world in extremely different ways to ourselves,&#34; but what matters is whether they feel pleasure and pain.\n  &#34;Animals have helped us quite a lot, so we should return the favour and help them,&#34; marine biologist Emily Sullivan tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\n The 25-year-old manages the research aquarium at the Marine Biological Association, which means she&#39;s worked with lots of invertebrates such as octopus, lobster, crabs, crayfish and cuttlefish.\n She feels they should be recognised in the bill - which is currently in the House of Lords.\n  There are already regulations around using animals in scientific research, including octopus and squid - though not all species.\n &#34;The aim of that is to minimise pain, stress and suffering in research,&#34; Emily says.\n  &#34;I personally do think they can recognise and feel pain, so should be protected more.&#34;\n Having interacted with lots of these species, Emily feels they are self-aware and understand what&#39;s around them.\n &#34;It definitely varies between species, and it&#39;s not the same level for all of them. But for example cuttlefish, related to octopus, are very intelligent,&#34; she says.\n &#34;The ones we have here, when you walk past their tank they come up and have a look, see what you&#39;re doing and definitely respond. You can see them watching you.&#34;\n  Emily feels it&#39;s clear when they feel pain or suffering &#34;because their behaviour changes a lot&#34;.\n &#34;They become quite lethargic and their appetite changes. That&#39;s true for a lot of the animals, including crabs and lobsters.&#34;\n  Emily says including them in the bill will have a big impact on the animals themselves because &#34;they aren&#39;t really protected or regulated much&#34;.\n The report found the UK fishing fleet lands more than 420 million of species such as squid, octopus, crabs and lobsters each year, and says &#34;with so many individuals at stake&#34;, it&#39;s important to be cautious even if there&#39;s not complete certainty these animals are sentient.\n  The new animal welfare legislation will mean any new government policy will have to take into account that vertebrate animals can experience feelings including pain or joy.\n That will be decided by a committee made up of animal experts from within the field.\n A spokeswoman from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs told Newsbeat the UK was &#34;proud to have some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world&#34;.\n &#34;We are fully committed to strengthening them further to ensure all animals avoid any unnecessary pain, distress or suffering,&#34; she said.\n She added there is already a review on the feelings of species such as octopus, cuttlefish and squid and the government will &#34;carefully consider the results&#34; of this.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 21:02:05", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7ae0\u9c7c,octopuses,\u52a8\u7269", "title": "MPS\uff1a\u7ae0\u9c7c\u611f\u5230\u75db\u82e6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fdd\u62a4 ", "title_en": "MPs: Octopuses feel pain and need legal protection", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-57528249", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7ae0\u9c7c", "octopuses", "\u52a8\u7269"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067025, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "zsync\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6587\u4ef6\u4f20\u8f93\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u5b83\u5141\u8bb8\u60a8\u4ece\u8fdc\u7a0b\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0b\u8f7d\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5176\u4e2d\u60a8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u6709\u65e7\u7248\u672c\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u526f\u672c\u3002 zsync\u4ec5\u4e0b\u8f7d\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u65b0\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0ersync\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5982\u679crsync\u88ab\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u53f0\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u540c\u6b65\u5230\u53e6\u4e00\u53f0\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\uff0c\u5219Zsync\u4e13\u4e3a\u6587\u4ef6\u5206\u53d1\u800c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u6587\u4ef6\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0a\u5206\u53d1\u5230\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5668\u3002 Zsync\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8f6f\u4ef6 -

It allows you to download a file from a remote server, where you have a copy of an older version of the file on your computer already. zsync downloads only the new parts of the file. It uses the same algorithm as  rsync. However, where rsync is designed for synchronising data from one computer to another within an organisation, zsync is designed for file distribution, with one file on a server to be distributed to thousands of downloaders. zsync requires no special server software \u2014 just a web server to host the files \u2014 and imposes no extra load on the server, making it ideal for large scale file distribution.\n zsync is  open source, distributed under version 2 of the Artistic License. Feedback, bugs reports and patches are welcome.\n  zsync fills a gap in the technology available for large-scale file distribution. Three key points explain why zsync provides a genuinely new technique for file distribution:\n \u2014 zsync uses the rsync algorithm, but runs it on the client side, thus avoiding the high server load associated with rsync.\n \u2014 zsync provides transfers that are nearly as efficient as rsync -z or cvsup, without the need to run a special server application. All that is needed is an HTTP/1.1-compliant web server. So it works through firewalls and on shared hosting accounts, and gives less security worries.\n \u2014 rsync is ineffective on compressed files, unless they are compressed with a patched version of gzip. zsync has special handling for gzipped files, which enables update transfers of files which are distributed in compressed form.\n The special handling of compressed files is, as far as I know, entirely new and unique to zsync. The combination of client-side rsync and HTTP is also unique to zsync, to the best of my knowledge.\n I have put up  technical papers. There is a current paper, which reflects zsync&#39;s latest development, and which I update with new figures as I run new tests and comparisons; there are also older snapshots of the technical paper, included for reference and citation.\n  zsync is only useful if people offer zsync downloads. I have made a deliberate effort to make zsync simple and reliable in use, and easy to deploy.\n \u2014 zsync downloads are offered by building a .zsync file, which contains the meta-data needed by zsync. This file contains the precalculated checksums for the rsync algorithm; it is generated on the server, once, and is then used by any number of downloaders.\n \u2014 .zsync files have a simple text header, so they can be edited with any good editor to change details like the download URL.\n \u2014 The .zsync contains either a relative URL to the full content of the file, so you can either generate and offer it on the same server as hosts the full download (and so it can be distributed like any other file onto mirror sites). Or it can contains one or more absolute URLs (the client will try multiple URLs if necessary to find the content), meaning the .zsync can be hosted on a different server entirely; in fact, the .zsync can be generated and offered by a third party, while still leaving most of the download to the original distribution site.\n Because zsync is a file distribution method, it is useful only when people offer .zsyncs for downloads. It&#39;s a little hard to demonstrate the program and build up a user base because of this. So I am suggesting a number of uses for zsync on the  client page; these include some zsync downloads that I am offering downloads myself to give some immediate use to the program.\n If you are a server operator looking to use zsync for file distribution, see the  server page, which gives some guidance on how to create and offer .zsync files.\n  I am fairly happy with how zsync works so far, but I am still open to new ideas and optimisations. I have made sure that the format is fairly extensible in a compatible way; I expect that users of the current version of zsync will not experience compatibility problems with later versions for the foreseeable future.\n I am also looking to freeze the interface between the zsync library and thecurrent command-line client; I will at some point split zsync into a dynamiclibrary, which implements the format and allows it to be embedded into otherprograms, and the client program. This to some extent depends on whether anyoneis interested in embedding zsync into other programs; if I don&#39;t hear of anyoneintending to do so, this might wait until I have a use for it myself.\n I am interested in  hearing feedback about zsync. Bugs, crashes, and feature suggestions are welcome. Perhaps most of all I am interested in hearing about uses of zsync: I would like to hear about any serious use of zsync, because knowing how people are using it will affect which features I work on. If there are features that you need to enable a particular use, then I would like to hear about that too, particularly anyone that is interested in using zsync as a library as part of a larger program; please note that support for multiple files has already been asked about many times, but due to lack of time I am not likely to work on this in the near future.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 21:01:51", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7b97\u6cd5,\u4e0b\u8f7d,differential,zsync", "title": "zsync\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528rsync\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728http\u4e0a\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5dee\u5206\u6587\u4ef6\uff082010\uff09 ", "title_en": "Zsync: Differential file downloading over HTTP using the rsync algorithm (2010)", "transed": 1, "url": "http://zsync.moria.org.uk/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7b97\u6cd5", "\u4e0b\u8f7d", "zsync"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "cf6f68a0d14132c82f7a2fd3ce349ff6.jpg", "infoid": 1067024, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\n\u867d\u7136\u975e\u5e38\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u7528\u6237\u6570\u91cf\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u52b3\u52a8\u529b -

Once seen as a liberatory technology that would usher in an era of creativity and new connections across the globe, many - from casual Twitter users to  professional content creators - have turned on the technology.\nYou can get a sense of the shift in mood from our media output: There&#39;s Netflix&#39;s popular, dystopian reality show &#34; The Circle,&#34; in which contestants cynically compete for money using often fake internet personas. One of the streaming site&#39;s most popular documentaries in the last year was &#34; The Social Dilemma,&#34; which captured viewers&#39; attention with its explanations of Facebook&#39;s privacy faux-pas. And even some of the most buzzed-about novels this year are about the darker sides of the internet, like Lauren Oyler&#39;s &#34; Fake Accounts,&#34; and Patricia Lockwood&#39;s &#34; No One Is Talking About This .&#34; We&#39;re all re-analyzing our relationship to the internet for good reason, but we&#39;ve misclassified what this relationship really is. It&#39;s not like a bad relationship, where you can just walk away, and it&#39;s not like junk food, where you can decide to eat less - it&#39;s an all-encompassing technology, our main economic engine, the tool we are forced to use to meet others and mediate our entire lives.    A solution to our current internet-use crisis cannot come at an individual level anymore than one person quitting their job would solve capitalism&#39;s poor working conditions. If we want any hope of making the internet less stressful, less back-breaking, and more fulfilling, content creators, gig economy workers, and even casual internet users need to push for a systemic solution.  A growing body of evidence suggests that the internet really is terrible for us. A  2018 study of college students found that limiting social media use to 10 minutes a day significantly reduced anxiety in its participants. A  2019 study found that teens who spent more time online were more likely to have mental health conditions.  Other studies find that social media users end up feeling more lonely, more isolated, and less self confident.\nA veritable cottage industry has cropped up to capitalize on people&#39;s knowledge that the internet is bad for them. The web is littered with how-tos on taking a break from social media, and self-help books have been written encouraging us to unplug. There are  several popular TED Talks from former internet engineers and executives telling people that the internet is bad for them and they should leave social media behind.  Retreats for the wealthy which forbid phones and computers have cropped up, and, perhaps most worryingly, the very people who build this technology are  sending their kids to schools where the technology is banned - a tacit admission of its potential to harm people&#39;s minds.        We&#39;re constantly reminded that the internet is bad for us and yet social media use is as high as it&#39;s ever been,  averaging 145 minutes per person per day globally. We&#39;re stuck in a cycle where we know something is bad, we want to stop, and yet, seemingly, we can&#39;t.\n We can&#39;t quit the internet because we&#39;ve conceptualized the problem all wrong. Social media is not an individual addiction that can be addressed at an individual level - it&#39;s a societal problem that needs a societal fix. We need to think of the internet less as a tool we all somehow can&#39;t stop using, and more as a factory we&#39;re required to be in. Our entire society has been reformulated around the internet, much like it was centered around the factory during the Industrial Revolution. If there&#39;s an  Amazon Web Services outage, much of our society stops functioning. Without the internet, we couldn&#39;t find jobs, or, at this point, even friends.     The &#34;gig economy&#34; - the often  underpaid and  exploitative labor performed by Uber drivers and Instacart shoppers - was enabled by the internet, and now  more than a quarter of workers in the US participate in this economy in some form. During the pandemic, office workers were only able to fulfil their required job duties through the internet, and college students forked over full tuition for the privilege of staring at Zoom for hours each day.\n We&#39;re all required to be here - online - for our livelihoods. But even when we&#39;re not required to be here, companies attempt to make sure we still are: App and game developers  use the same science that keeps people playing the slots in Las Vegas to keep us glued to our screens.\nAs culture and media theorist McKenzie Wark  writes in her book &#34;Capital is Dead: Is This Something Worse?&#34;, the internet uses our labor without us really knowing it. Unlike the broadcast era of media, during which the owners of television networks and movie studios had to at least create the content to sell to us, we now create all the content for each other, mostly without being paid.     &#34;[Social media companies like Facebook] don&#39;t even bother to provide any entertainment,&#34; Wark writes. &#34;We have to entertain each other, while they collect the rent, and they collect it on all social media time, public or private, work or leisure, and (if you keep your FitBit on) even when you sleep.&#34;\n We produce the memes, tweets, posts, and pictures that keep us tethered to the internet, and then that  content is monetized in the form of advertisements - revenue users help produce, but do not usually see a penny of.\nAlthough a very select number of internet users  can get paid for their labor - i.e.  influencers or popular YouTubers - most of us do not. If the internet is a factory, it is one in which the vast majority of people are not getting paid. Instead, users often fight with each other for non-monetary payment  in the form of clout - recognition that we can produce the most and best content for free.   &#34;In some quarters [of society], this affective currency has replaced the wages of industrialization, especially for professionals who used to earn a structured living from paid content and who now disseminate their bylines far and wide in hopes of securing a niche livelihood from name recognition,&#34; the sociologist Andrew Ross  writes. This free or cheap labor has widened income inequality massively, according to some theorists. We fight for followers, retweets, and likes, all for free, while the platforms we&#39;re on profit massively. And only a few, large companies are collecting these profits;  almost 70% of all digital ad spending goes to either Google, Facebook, or Amazon.\nAs Yasha Levine writes in his book &#34; Surveillance Valley,&#34; the internet was never meant to be a place friendly to the average user - it was developed by the US military to spy on people during wars, and then used to spy on Americans at home too. Some of Google&#39;s initial funding  came from grants from US spy agencies. When the infrastructure of the internet was sold off by the US government to private companies, the people who stood to profit off that privatization funded magazines, advertisements, and lobbying to reframe the internet from a surveillance tool to one that could liberate us culturally. As detailed by Levine, Louis Rossetto - the founder of Wired Magazine, the biggest megaphone for evangelizing the new, privatized internet in the 1990s - was an Ayn Rand fan who believed the internet would come to replace the need for a government.     Today we live in this libertarian vision of the internet in which companies exist largely unregulated, undertaxed, and able to do what they want without worry that the government will interfere.\n But now, more people seem to be seeing through the hype. So, the question now is what to do with this new, collective revelation.If the internet is somewhat like a factory, perhaps we should treat it like one. In 2014, the artist Laurel Ptak created a manifesto called  Wages for Facebook in which she argued that Facebook should pay users for their content:     &#34;They say it&#39;s friendship. We say it&#39;s unwaged work. With every like, chat, tag or poke our subjectivity turns them a profit. They call it sharing. We call it stealing.&#34;\n Though Ptak&#39;s work is a piece of art, not a  strategy for changing the web, it could be a starting point. Perhaps we as internet users can organize to stop giving away our hearts and minds for free so that a select few can profit off of them. Just as labor organizers have pushed to make other industries less exploitative, perhaps we need a movement to do the same with the internet.\nAs Levine writes, in 1969, hundreds of students at Harvard gathered to protest the university&#39;s involvement in the creation of ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet.

It\u2019s a glitchy, 10-year-old underdog of a game with a cult following of programmers, engineers, astronaut candidates, and your typical lay explosion enthusiasts, and it has a unique and active community of modders who\u2019ve been fixing bugs, adding new features, and generally keeping the game fresh for nearly a decade.\n In the game, you are the omniscient director of a space program composed of literal little green men (and beloved little green woman Valentina Kerman\u2014we see you, trailblazer) that you send skyward in spacecraft of your own design. It often feels like watching those blurry old videos of rockets launching only to come straight back down in an explosion of fiery schadenfreude: you feel a little bit frightened, a little bit sadistic, and you really want to try it again.\n  One of the most prolific  Kerbal modders is Chris Adderley, Nertea in the game, who is an engineer at the Canadian space company  MDA by day, designing ground-based systems that retrieve data from spacecraft. But in his off time, Adderley gets into the pilot\u2019s seat himself. He started playing  Kerbal Space Program soon after its release, and in 2013 started building his first mod for the game\u2014a pack of spare parts, including a xenon fuel tank and a magnetoplasmadynamic thruster (just try saying that three times fast).\n Since then, he\u2019s designed dozens of additional mods, including a Mark IV Spaceplane and space station add-ons like centrifuges and inflatable habitats.\n \u201cI build stuff that I\u2019d like to see us as a species build in the future,\u201d says Adderley.\n Recently, Addlerley decided to take some of the most plausible far-future theoretical rocket engine concepts and build them in the game\u2014introducing a way for gamers to try out these sci-fi  concepts in a simulated environment that can teach us how they might actually work, on a more practical level, in the future.\n    Adderley combed through dozens of scientific papers that outlined theoretical blueprints for these ultra-advanced propulsion systems, looking for those that were most realistic.\n \u201cEverybody tries to sell their project as the propulsion system of the future,\u201d says Adderley. \u201cYou need to kind of think a little bit critically about what people have hand waved.\u201d\n He crunched the numbers, considered how much power a specific engine would need, how to deal with the heat produced, and how you\u2019d harness the energy to propel the virtual rocket further. \u201cThat was superfun, which might be a supernerdy statement, but you know.\u201d\n In the end, he built out 13 different engine concepts, including fusion engines\u2014like   The Expanse&#39;s Epstein drive is theorized to be\u2014fission engines, and antimatter rockets.\n Though we don\u2019t yet have the technology to implement these specific-impulse demons, there is some real world value in being able to simulate advanced engines in a low-stakes environment. In fact, it\u2019s such a great sandbox that engineers at SpaceX and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory have used Kerbal graphics in their presentations. In 2018,  NASA released Open MCT, a telemetry data visualization software designed for operating spacecraft, to the public on Github. It\u2019s costly and time-consuming to test these systems on real spacecraft, so some participants ran their programs through Kerbal instead.\n For Sumontro Sinha, an aerospace engineer and fusion researcher at the Propulsion Research Lab at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, Kerbal is the go-to for testing out new ideas and training new engineers.\n \u201cInstead of Powerpoint slides and pages of equations, just make the ship and see how it works,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it works in Kerbal, then it has a good chance of working in real life.\u201d\n  The  spherical tokamak fusion engine is based on the fictional spaceship in   2001: A Space Odyssey, sans HAL the killer AI. Adderley found the actual science behind it in  a NASA study, in which the paper\u2019s lead author, Craig Williams, says NASA funded a number of projects focused on developing advanced propulsion systems. Williams\u2019 team designed an engine that uses the energy produced by a fusion reaction to generate thrust. Fusion occurs naturally in the interior of stars like our sun, where lightweight atoms are superheated to the point where their electrons and neutrons decouple and neutrons, normally repellant to one another, fuse together and produce massive amounts of energy. One of the biggest challenges in producing this energy on Earth is that you need a way to confine the resultant plasma and harness its power.\n    One way to do this is with a tokamak, a device that generates a donut-shaped magnetic field that keeps the superheated plasma in place. In Williams\u2019 engine prototype, this tokamak would be nearly spherical\u2014more like a donut hole. The exhaust produced would propel the vehicle to over 166,000 mph, taking passengers to Jupiter in just under 4 months. To put that into perspective, the deep space probe Voyager is traveling away from our solar system at 35,000 mph.\n When Williams\u2019 paper came out in 2001, the authors wrote that the capability to produce this type of engine might be 30 years out. Now that it\u2019s 2021, Williams is revising his estimate. \u201cWe\u2019re probably not any closer,\u201d he says. His paper came out in an era of enthusiasm for advanced propulsion, but much of that zeal has waned until recently. \u201cYou can\u2019t really make much progress when there\u2019s no active program going on, \u201c he says. \u201cUntil you start the clock again, that 30-year projection will just keep moving forward.\u201d Bummer. But in the decades between now and humanity\u2019s era of two-week Saturn vacations, you can still try out your own digital version of Williams\u2019 engine.\n  The Afterburner  fission fragment rocket engine is based on another NASA-funded engine concept study from 2011 that utilizes the energy created in nuclear reactions to propel a spacecraft forward. Reactors filled with  Americium, a highly radioactive rare material that is a byproduct of uranium-driven nuclear reactions, generate fission products that flow down a chamber. This chamber is injected with hydrogen gas, which gets intensely excited when it meets up with the fission fragments and generates a plasma that is funneled through a powerful magnetic nozzle as thrust.\n With this breakthrough, a round trip to Mars would take 292 days, including a 60-day stay on the planet. While the engine is slower overall than a fusion engine would be, it\u2019s far closer to what we\u2019re technologically capable of at present.\n \u201cThe nuclear thermal rocket is a technology that is getting developed, and it\u2019s already been demonstrated,\u201d says Jason Cassibry, who leads the Propulsion Research Center at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. In April, DARPA  selected three contractors to demonstrate the first phase of a nuclear thermal rocket, and NASA and the DOE put out  a call for similar preliminary designs in February. Cassibry says fission fragment and nuclear pulse engines are not far behind, but they have additional engineering hurdles to face, including figuring out how to divert all that energy away from the hull of the spacecraft so it doesn&#39;t burn up in space.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 19:02:36", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "space,kerbal", "title":

", "note_en": "In a tumultuous time humanity looks to the ancient world for guidance and inspiration. It\u2019s a dynamic at least as old as Petrarch, the 14th-century Italian poet whose scholarship on the Greeks and Romans helped kick-start the Renaissance.\n  Paul Skallas, a 36-year-old technology lawyer and writer, has today picked up antiquity\u2019s torch. He\u2019s an evangelist for wisdom derived from the distant past: like, say, skip the mouthwash.\n \u201cEveryone tells you to do it. Your breath is clean, it feels like the right thing to do,\u201d he said during a Zoom call from Deauville, France, where he moved from New York City last fall to ride out the pandemic. \u201cAnd then you read about  higher cancer rates for people who used it, and  how it destroys good and bad bacteria, and you go, \u2018You\u2019re right, there was no mouthwash back then.\u2019\u201d\n \u201cBack then\u201d is the ancient world, from which Mr. Skallas draws an inexhaustible supply of practical lessons.\n \u201cNo breakfast,\u201d he said. \u201cBreakfast was unknown in early history, Rome, Byzantium, ancient Greece, breakfast wasn\u2019t really a thing.\u201d He\u2019s  written about the anti-breakfast positions of Plutarch and Thomas Aquinas.\n Mr. Skallas is a proponent for a lifestyle based on a relatively obscure theory called the Lindy Effect, from which he has derived his Twitter handle, LindyMan; his Substack,  The Lindy Newsletter; his podcast, \u201c Lindy Talk\u201d; and his practical philosophy of health, exercise, diet and consumer choice.\n  The Lindy Effect can be traced to a  1964 article in The New Republic called \u201cLindy\u2019s Law,\u201d by the historian Albert Goldman, who described the \u201cbald-headed, cigar-chomping know-it-alls who foregather every night at Lindy\u2019s,\u201d the diner then on Broadway known for its cheesecake, and postulated that since comedians have an exhaustible supply of good material, the \u201clife expectancy of a television comedian is proportional to the total amount of his exposure on the medium.\u201d\n Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a statistician and scholar, tweaked this idea into a broad theory of survivability in his 2012 book, \u201cAntifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder.\u201d He named it the Lindy Effect: \u201cFor the perishable, every additional day in its life translates into a shorter additional life expectancy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFor the nonperishable, every additional day may imply a longer life expectancy.\u201d\n For example, a play that has run on Broadway for five years will likely stick around for five more. He concluded: \u201cThe robustness of an item is proportional to its life!\u201d\n Mr. Taleb argued that the Lindy Effect helps explain why so many seemingly earthshaking new developments end up forgotten or disproved. For example, many scientists have spent the last decade in a state of alarm about  the \u201creplication\u201d crisis: that many findings turn out not to hold up when other scientists repeat the studies.\n Inaccurate science, in other words, is constantly being published. The Lindy-conscious consumer of scientific data will take seriously only information that has held up over a period of time.\n Lindy, he wrote in  a 2017 post on Medium, cannot be fooled: \u201cThe only effective judge of things is time.\u201d\n  Mr. Skallas has long followed and read Mr. Taleb, with whom he shares a fascination with the ancient world. He even once managed to elicit a rare correction from the scholar after disproving an assertion in one of Mr. Taleb\u2019s books, which claimed the ancients did not have a word for the color blue.\n While Mr. Taleb primarily discussed the Lindy Effect as in terms of statistics and social science, Mr. Skallas has expounded at length about the practical applications of Lindy when it comes to diet, health, dating, exercise and practically everything else. He has become something of a lifestyle guru to thousands of Twitter followers and newsletter readers: think Goop or Joe Rogan by way of the Bronze Age.\n In a 2020 Substack post outlining his ideas, he wrote, \u201cLindy exists chiefly for your protection, for risk/survival strategies in the modern world,\u201d with its constant onslaught of \u201cnew products, new academic disciplines, new books, new technologies, new foods, new living arrangements, new \u2018theories\u2019 on life, new postures.\u201d\n  Lindy is not Luddism: Mr. Skallas is an avid social media user, after all. Rather, he scours the ancient world for applicable nuggets of what he calls \u201cuseful tradition,\u201d using the Lindy Effect\u2019s heuristic of older is better as a \u201cbulwark against consumerism,\u201d to sift through the \u201ctons of products coming out every day.\u201d\n \u201cWhen I\u2019m at the store, I think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new way of looking at skepticism of modern commercial life.\u201d\n Mr. Skallas endorses practices with a basis in antiquity, like intermittent fasting, which appears across religious traditions and has demonstrable  health benefits (though  also detractors). \u201cYour body gets stronger through stressors, and it gets stronger through the lack of food,\u201d he said.\n He follows a diet drawn from Greek Orthodox tradition, alternating between veganism and pescatarianism (today some call this serial cycling). A tweet from his account @LindyDiet laid out further specifics: \u201cFast 2 times a week (vegan or abstain from food) and a month straight 2 times a year.\u201d\n Somewhat akin to the advocates of the paleo diet, Mr. Skallas recommends avoiding eating any foods or beverages invented in the past 500 years. This means no Beyond Beef, Monster Energy or Go-Gurt but yes to mutton, hot cross buns and the like.\n \u201cCoffee is relatively new,\u201d he said, acknowledging the arbitrariness of the cutoff. \u201cIt\u2019s 400 years old, but that\u2019s 400 years of pretty good filtering, and it\u2019s probably not bad for you.\u201d Tea merits his highest compliment: It\u2019s a \u201cdeep Lindy\u201d beverage, with thousands of years of provenance.\n Cigarettes, a 20th-century vice, are not Lindy, though tobacco is; for those who want to smoke in a \u201cLindy compatible way,\u201d he suggests a pipe.\n Mr. Skallas eschews modern exercise machines, urging his readers in a newsletter post to stick with simple weight lifting, citing Milos of Croton, the mythical Greek bodybuilder who lifted a calf daily until he could hoist the adult bull.\n \u201cBodybuilding culture is some grotesque subculture that is a product of modernity,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWorking out isn\u2019t about the muscles, but about the other systems in your body, interconnected to each other.\u201d\n Likewise he is skeptical of yoga, given that the form practiced by most Americans today was  invented in the 20th century. \u201cIs Yoga good or bad for you? I have no idea,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLindy doesn\u2019t say \u2018don\u2019t do it,\u2019 it says \u2018we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u2019\u201d\n  Mr. Skallas, who spends his work day reading contracts, does not see himself as a self-help figure or a philosopher. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Jordan Peterson thing,\u201d he said, referring to the Canadian philosopher whose books offer advice  directed at young men. \u201cI\u2019m not into motivation,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just like, \u2018Whoa, look at this.\u2019\u201d\n    Sleek midcentury modernism? \u201cAnytime you get away from fractal patterns and ornate details, it\u2019s not Lindy.\u201d\n How about sex toys? \u201cLindy,\u201d he said, adding, by way of explanation, \u201c ancient Egypt.\u201d\n The Jeffrey Epstein scandal? \u201cSome rich guy going around and doing criminal behavior and abusing people? It\u2019s pretty Lindy!\u201d\n Epstein, he pointed out, exemplified how Lindy is not a moral compass; lots of common behaviors in the ancient world would be considered abhorrent today.\n  Yet the persistence of behaviors across millenniums makes the lessons of antiquity potent. \u201cHuman nature doesn\u2019t change,\u201d he said. The ancients \u201creally did study the person and how people act, and some of it is quite good.\u201d\n Therapy, for example, is something he believes in, but not because he holds stock in the theories of Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud; rather, he argued, therapy works because the therapist embodies the deep Lindy role of a sympathetic friend in the alienating modern world.\n Of course, the Lindy effect doesn\u2019t work in every domain; if you are diagnosed with cancer, seek chemotherapy, Mr. Skallas said, rather than relying on Roman medical practices. He thinks Lindy is more useful when it comes to skepticism of industrial-age consumables, like mouthwash or processed seed oils, and faddish social science, like the  debunked Myers-Briggs test.\n And ancient practices can provide powerful inchoate benefits to their practitioners, even when the exact cause and effect may be unclear at the time. In his newsletter, Mr. Skallas cited the 2016 book \u201cThe Secret Of Our Success,\u201d by Joseph Heinrich, a professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard.\n Mr. Heinrich researched the history of manioc, a bitter root domesticated in South America, which can be toxic if not prepared properly. In the Amazon, \u201cIndigenous Tukanoans use a multistep, multiday processing technique that involves scraping, grating, and finally washing the roots,\u201d to remove cyanide.\n After the Portuguese transported manioc to West Africa in the 17th century, the root spread rapidly, but the proper processing techniques did not. \u201cEven after hundreds of years, chronic cyanide poisoning remains a serious health problem in Africa,\u201d Mr. Heinrich writes.\n  Mr. Skallas often invents new terms of art: He talks about \u201c the 4HL,\u201d or four-hour life, as in the amount of free time available to modern office workers, and of \u201c refinement culture,\u201d the smoothed-down sameness of contemporary aesthetics, exemplified by the similarity of new car designs, brand logos and urban cafe interiors.\n His most significant coinage may be \u201cLindy walk,\u201d which he came up with last year, seeking an escape from the quarantine doldrums.\n \u201cThat just basically means a stroll,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also in a lot of ancient cultures, a heavy tradition of walking, right? There\u2019s the Sabbath stroll. In Greek, it\u2019s called Volta. There\u2019s an Italian version of it. It\u2019s just walking for the sake of walking.\u201d\n In a newsletter post, Mr. Skallas cited Greek walkers \u201cfrom Diogenes wandering the world looking for an honest man to Thales stumbling into a pit while lost in thought.\u201d\n A Lindy walk isn\u2019t just a beeline from Point A to Point B; there should be no set destination, with turns made at random to stimulate the mind. \u201cAn interesting thing happened when I walked. I had thoughts popping into my head,\u201d Mr. Skallas wrote. \u201cWaves of ideas would come through. I wasn\u2019t \u2018trying\u2019 to think or even come up with an idea. It would just appear. Like magic.\u201d\n  Many of Mr. Skallas\u2019s readers began taking daily Lindy walks and posting about them on social media, and the term has now spread beyond his immediate readership.\n \u201cEssentially it\u2019s just conscious habit forming, but I think the cute name for some reason makes it more enticing and endearing,\u201d as one follower put it.\n Mr. Skallas thinks the pandemic \u2014 itself deep Lindy (\u201cthey put on a mask 500 years ago, right?\u201d) \u2014 opened people\u2019s eyes to the worldview by evoking ancient, world-historical dangers that many had felt insulated from. \u201cI think before this pandemic hit, we were living in a time of, \u2018Hey, man, we\u2019re untouchable,\u2019\u201d he said. But quarantine forced many to begin \u201cthinking about scarcity,\u201d and ask themselves, \u201cWhat is Lindy? Like, what is the stuff you need in this life?\u201d\n Vaccination was among those things, and so the next time Mr. Skallas was contacted for this article, he was in Chicago, where he\u2019d traveled for his shot. He wrote in an email that although he wasn\u2019t giving up his day job just yet, a book (very Lindy) might be in the works.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 18:55:52", "source_domain":

This new version is self contained with respect to power and uses three slightly modified bicycle brakes instead of the metal barriers used in the previous version. We are currently developing learning algorithms that allow the Cubli to automatically learn and adjust the necessary parameters if a jump fails due to the deterioration of the brakes and changes in inertia, weight, or slope of the surface.\n  Can we build a 15cm sided cube that can jump up, balance on its corner, and walk across our desk using off-the-shelf motors, batteries, and electronic components?\n There are multiple ways to keep a cube in its balance, but jumping up requires a sudden release of energy. Intuitively momentum wheels seemed like a good idea to store enough energy while still keeping the cube compact and self-contained.\n Furthermore, the same momentum wheels can be used to implement a reaction-torque based control algorithm for balancing by exploiting the reaction torques on the cube\u2019s body when the wheels are accelerated or decelerated.\n    The first step in creating the robot, therefore, was to look at the physics to figure out if a jump-up based on momentum wheels was possible. The image below shows some of the math to figure out the Moment of Inertia (MOI) of the wheel and full cube.\n  This mathematical analysis allowed a quantitative understanding of the system which allowed to inform design choices, such as the trade offs of using three momentum wheels vs. a design with a momentum wheel mounted on each of the six inner faces of the cube.\n Another outcome of this analysis was a good understanding of the required velocities of the momentum wheel to allow the cube to jump up, and the torques required to keep the cube in balance. Both factors were critical for the next steps: Determining the required hardware specs.\n   Specs and hardware design Given the required velocities and torques determined above, it was clear that the momentum wheel\u2019s motor and gearbox would be a major challenge for creating the robot. Using the mathematical model allowed to systematically tackle this problem by allowing a quantitative analysis of the trade-offs between higher velocities (i.e., more energy for jump-up) and higher torques (i.e., better stability when balancing).\n  This mathematics-driven hardware design resulted in detailed specs for the robot\u2019s core hardware components (momentum wheels, motors, gears, and batteries) and allowed a CAD design of the entire system.\n    Part of this step was the design of a special brake to suddenly stop a momentum wheel to transfer its energy to the entire cube and cause it to jump up.\n  The photo to the left shows an early design of this brake, consisting of a screw mounted on the momentum wheel, a servo motor (shown in black) to move a metal plate (in blue) into the screw\u2019s path (in light brown), and a mounting bracket (in light brown) to transfer the momentum wheel\u2019s energy to the cube structure. The current design uses a combination of hardened metal parts and rubber to reduce peak forces.\n   2D prototype To validate the mechanics and electronics of the jump-up and balancing strategy and prove feasibility of the overall concept a one-dimensional version was built:\n  The results obtained with this 2D version of the cube were published in an  IROS 2012 paper.\n   The  final robot Following successful tests with the 2D version, a full robot was built. The result is Cubli, a small cube-shaped robot, named after the Swiss-German diminutive for \u201ccube\u201d.\n   However, first jump-up tests showed that the stress resulting from a sudden braking of the momentum wheel led to mechanical deformations of the momentum wheels and aluminium frame. This made repeated jump-ups of the whole Cubli impossible without part replacement. It was therefore decided to tweak the structure and breaking mechanism to reduce the mechanical stress caused by the jump-up.\n In addition to balancing, my colleagues are now investigating the use of controlled manoeuvres of jumping up, balancing, and falling over to make the Cubli walk across a surface.\n    Key infos Robot name: Cubli Researchers:  Mohanarajah Gajamohan,  Raffaello D\u2019Andrea Mechanical design:  Igor Thommen Websites:  http://www.idsc.ethz.ch/Research_DAndrea/Cubli,  http://raffaello.name/cubli Status: Ongoing research project Last update:  March December 2013\n  Note 1: This post is part of our  Swiss Robots Series.
