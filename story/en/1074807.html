I don’t think it’s any secret that I’m fairly skeptical of crypto, but I want to come by that skepticism honestly — and on the flip side, I want to make sure to see its opportunities and benefits clearly. We’ve already done episodes on  Bitcoin and  DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations), and we’re going to do more episodes as the year goes on.</p><p>我要告诉你们一个解码器的秘密：去年年底，我委托我们的制作人寻找更好的方法，让我们在解码器上报道crypto和Web3。我不认为我对加密技术相当怀疑是什么秘密，但我想诚实地接受这种怀疑——另一方面，我想确保清楚地看到它的机会和好处。我们已经在比特币和DAOs（去中心化的自治组织）上做了一些剧集，随着时间的推移，我们将做更多的剧集。</p><p> A lot of Web3 ideas seem to run directly into the existing legal system in complicated and sometimes very funny ways. The NFT world seems to have an impressionistic understanding of copyright law. DAOs, well, they aren’t actually recognized as legal entities in most states. So in a very technical sense, they can’t actually do anything in the real world. But all these things still exist, and at some point, the law will have to catch up.</p><p>许多Web3想法似乎以复杂、有时非常有趣的方式直接进入了现有的法律体系。NFT世界似乎对版权法有着印象派的理解。DAO在大多数州实际上都不被承认为法律实体。所以从技术角度来说，他们在现实世界中什么都做不了。但所有这些事情仍然存在，在某个时候，法律将不得不迎头赶上。</p><p> So, today, I’m talking to Tonya Evans, a law professor at Penn State Dickinson Law. She teaches IP law, copyright, and blockchain. She also hosts the  Tech Intersect podcast, where she covers how law and technology intersect. She has spent a lot of time thinking about crypto assets and how they interact with the law. Tonya’s point of view is that we shouldn’t just abandon many of the legal frameworks we have today — she just wants them to adapt to this new internet.</p><p>今天，我要和宾夕法尼亚州立大学迪金森法学院的法学教授Tonya Evans谈话。她教授知识产权法、版权和区块链。她还主持了TechIntersect播客，她在播客中讲述了法律和技术是如何交叉的。她花了很多时间思考加密资产以及它们如何与法律互动。Tonya的观点是，我们不应该放弃我们今天拥有的许多法律框架——她只是想让它们适应这个新的互联网。</p><p> A few notes since the old law student in me can’t help trying to impress law professors when we have them on the show:</p><p>自从我是一名老法律系学生以来，当我们让法律教授上节目时，我忍不住要给他们留下深刻印象：</p><p> Tonya and I make reference to “the four corners” of an agreement. That’s lawyer slang for what a contract specifically covers.</p><p>Tonya和我提到了协议的“四个角落”。这是律师的俚语，指合同具体涵盖的内容。</p><p> We talk a lot about “partnership law,” which is how different kinds of companies are treated under the law. A “general partnership” is the default — everyone in the company is an equal partner and liable for everything the company does; an LLC or limited liability company is a company that protects the principals from being liable for what the company does. Right now, most states don’t recognize DAOs as any kind of company, which means they’ll be treated as general partnerships, and everyone in the DAO would be liable for what the DAO does.</p><p>我们经常谈论《合伙法》，即根据该法对待不同类型的公司的方式。“普通合伙”是默认的——公司中的每个人都是平等的合伙人，对公司所做的一切负责；有限责任公司（LLC）或有限责任公司是一家保护委托人不为公司行为负责的公司。目前，大多数州不承认DAO是任何类型的公司，这意味着它们将被视为普通合伙企业，DAO中的每个人都将对DAO的行为负责。</p><p> And, we talked a lot about copyright law: the current copyright law in the United States was passed in 1976, with some updates in 1998 as part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA. You’ll hear us say “copyright maximalist,” which is the idea that copyright should cover a lot of things and rights holders should have a lot of power over how their work is used, and “copyleft,” which is the idea that people should be able to use and modify works more freely for the public good.</p><p>我们还谈到了很多关于版权法的问题：美国现行的版权法于1976年通过，1998年作为《数字千年版权法》（Digital Millennium copyright Act，简称DMCA）的一部分进行了一些更新。你会听到我们说“版权至上主义者”，这是一种观点，版权应该涵盖很多东西，权利持有者应该对他们的作品如何使用拥有很大的权力，以及“版权保留主义者”，这是一种观点，即人们应该能够为了公共利益更自由地使用和修改作品。</p><p>    Professor Tonya Evans is a law professor at Penn State Dickinson Law, where she teaches entertainment law, intellectual property law, and blockchain — a rich intersection for our show. Welcome to   Decoder .</p><p>Tonya Evans教授是宾夕法尼亚州立大学迪金森法学院的法学教授，她在那里教授娱乐法、知识产权法和区块链——这是我们节目的丰富交叉点。欢迎来到解码器。</p><p>  We have a lot to talk about, but I want to start with you. You are a lawyer and a professor. You have a long background teaching IP and entertainment law. How did you end up teaching cryptocurrency and NFTs?</p><p>我们有很多要谈，但我想先从你们开始。你是律师和教授。你有很长的知识产权和娱乐法教学背景。你是怎么教加密货币和NFT的？</p><p> Back in 2017, I fell down the proverbial rabbit hole trying to figure out what the heck blockchain is and how it related to crypto assets. More broadly, folks focus on the idea of cryptocurrencies, but I used the broader term of crypto assets. I was not at all convinced about magic leprechaun money that lived somewhere on the internet. I’m licensed in four states — if it had anything to do with illegal activity, I wanted nothing to do with it because I’m going to hold on to my four licenses. Personally, I am always an early adopter of technology even though I don’t have a scientific or technical background per se. I thought it was important for me to at least figure out what it all is and what it means for the next wave of lawyers who have to really show up for businesses and technologists who are really creating the future today.</p><p>早在2017年，我就跌入了众所周知的兔子洞，试图弄清楚什么是该死的区块链，以及它与加密资产的关系。更广泛地说，人们关注加密货币的概念，但我使用了更广泛的加密资产术语。我一点也不相信住在互联网上某个地方的神奇小妖精的钱。我有四个州的执照——如果它与非法活动有关，我不想与之有任何关系，因为我将保留我的四个执照。就个人而言，我一直是技术的早期使用者，尽管我本身没有科学或技术背景。我认为对我来说，重要的是至少弄清楚这一切是什么，这对下一波律师来说意味着什么，他们必须真正为今天真正创造未来的企业和技术专家而出现。</p><p> I started by focusing more on distributed ledger technology, which is a fancy way of describing blockchains. I also worked at the intersection of intellectual property and blockchain generally, but copyright in particular. There were a lot of open-source projects, and the fact that you have these public-facing digital records of transactions and balances — that was really interesting to me. I was starting to get some calls about folks who wanted to build on top of the layer-one infrastructure of blockchains. They wanted to monetize it, so I wanted to be conversant with the technology so I could best advise people — mostly entrepreneurs and startups in the space. I also wanted to be able to educate, again, the next wave of lawyers to really understand the intellectual property issues that were going to pop up in what we now commonly refer to as Web3.</p><p>我一开始更多地关注分布式账本技术，这是一种描述区块链的奇特方式。我也在知识产权和区块链的交叉点工作，尤其是版权。有很多开源项目，你有这些面向公众的交易和余额数字记录，这对我来说非常有趣。我开始接到一些人的电话，他们想在区块链的第一层基础设施之上进行构建。他们想将其货币化，所以我想熟悉这项技术，这样我就可以为人们提供最好的建议——主要是该领域的企业家和初创企业。我还希望能够再次教育下一波律师，让他们真正理解我们现在通常所说的Web3中即将出现的知识产权问题。</p><p> So that’s 2017. It’s now 2022. I would say your predictions were correct.</p><p>那就是2017年。现在是2022年。我认为你的预测是正确的。</p><p>  There are many issues at play. It doesn’t seem like the legal frameworks have caught up to us, making some of these issues even more complicated. On the cultural side, the phrase “Web3” exists now. Everyone’s talking about it. You and I are talking just a few days after the Super Bowl, which was crypto ad city. From your perspective — having tracked it for five years or so — is crypto mainstream? Is this the time when it’s turning the corner and everyone has to understand it? Or is it still entrepreneurs, tech journalists, and lawyers who are building a framework so crypto can go mainstream?</p><p>有很多问题在起作用。法律框架似乎没有跟上我们的步伐，这使得其中一些问题变得更加复杂。在文化方面，“Web3”一词现在已经存在。每个人都在谈论这件事。你和我是在超级碗比赛几天后聊的，那是一个加密广告城。从你的角度来看——追踪了五年左右——加密技术是主流吗？是不是到了拐弯的时候，每个人都必须明白这一点？还是企业家、科技记者和律师仍在构建一个框架，使加密技术成为主流？</p><p> These are the early days. The first blockchain is the Bitcoin blockchain that first launched in 2009. We are turning the corner, but it’s still relatively early. There are more folks than just technologists, or cypherpunks, or those who are either on the fringe of tech or the fringe of finance. We have more mainstream folks. That’s the reason that millions of dollars were spent for Crypto Bowl — also known as the crypto ads during the Super Bowl. Some really epic ones from Coinbase and FTX and Crypto.com — I am not paid by any of them. I would like to be. Please call me. I’m on Twitter.</p><p>现在是早期。第一个区块链是2009年首次推出的比特币区块链。我们正在转弯，但还早。不仅仅是技术专家或密码朋克，或者那些处于技术或金融边缘的人，还有更多的人。我们有更多的主流人士。这就是为什么“加密碗”花费了数百万美元的原因——超级碗期间的加密广告。一些来自Coinbase、FTX和Crypto的真正史诗般的作品。com-他们中的任何人都没有给我报酬。我想成为。请给我打电话。我在推特上。</p><p> But that’s when you know when it really hits the common ethos: when ad money is being spent to attract more folks not on the margins. Crypto really is still a very small segment of the larger financial markets. Even though the big banks and traditional finance have known about this technology for a long time, they were not forced to actually pay attention until now. Now crypto is a customer service issue; they want to make sure that they maintain their market share and maintain their control over their customers. Financial institutions want to make sure that if there’s some new hot product, they’re the ones bridging the divide between folks who don’t know about crypto and tech, so that customers actually stay with their financial products.</p><p>但这时你才知道它真正击中了共同的精神：当广告钱被用来吸引更多的人而不是边缘人。加密技术在更大的金融市场中仍然只是很小的一部分。尽管大银行和传统金融业早就知道这项技术，但直到现在，他们才被迫真正关注这项技术。现在加密是一个客户服务问题；他们希望确保自己保持市场份额，并保持对客户的控制。金融机构希望确保，如果有一些新的热门产品，他们是弥合不了解加密和技术的人之间分歧的人，这样客户就可以真正使用他们的金融产品。</p><p> Those are the financial products. One of the things that strikes me about all tech companies is that the way you disrupt the incumbent is simple: you ignore the regulatory environment that costs the incumbent money. The example that always comes to mind for me is actually YouTube, which developed a dominant share of video streaming in the early days by just ignoring the existence of copyright law, more or less. I’ll pick on Viacom: Viacom could not have built a YouTube because they were the incumbent. They would’ve never been able to get the content onto any site they had built because their lawyers would’ve stopped them. YouTube was like, “We don’t have lawyers. We’re just a bunch of guys.”</p><p>这些就是金融产品。所有科技公司让我印象深刻的一点是，你扰乱在位者的方式很简单：你忽视了让在位者付出代价的监管环境。我经常想到的一个例子就是YouTube，它在早期几乎无视版权法的存在，在视频流媒体中占据了主导地位。我会挑维亚康姆的毛病：维亚康姆不可能建立一个YouTube，因为他们是在任者。因为他们的律师会阻止他们，所以他们永远无法将内容上传到他们建立的任何网站上。YouTube说，“我们没有律师，我们只是一群人。”</p><p>  Right. The cost of compliance and the lawsuit against Viacom was worth it for the overwhelming profits they now generate for existing in the space. That is just a paradigmatic story of how internet companies get built. Do you think that’s what the crypto companies are doing now in relation to the banks? Do you think they’re ignoring their regulatory environments and saying, “We’ll pay the price down the line, but it’s worth it to get to where we need to go?”</p><p>正当合规成本和针对维亚康姆的诉讼是值得的，因为他们现在在太空中生存产生了巨大的利润。这只是互联网公司如何建立的一个范例。你认为加密公司现在对银行就是这么做的吗？你是否认为他们忽视了他们的监管环境，并说，“我们会为此付出代价，但到达我们需要去的地方是值得的？”</p><p> It’s interesting because when I think about crypto life before companies, the whole point of it was decentralization — not having a centralized, more formal structure to actually deliver “products.” It’s antithetical, really, to the origins and the original ethos and spirit of crypto where it’s like, “We may not know each other or trust each other. We don’t trust government. We don’t trust big business. We’re going to trust the code. We’re going to share this common code across all of these different computers, and then it will be impervious to attack. It will be working outside of the traditional system.” Some parts of the internet and Web1 and Web2 were built like this as well. As you’re talking about the impact of regulation and maybe the perception of the absence of a regulatory environment — I don’t actually buy into that totally. I know that if I have a crypto wallet and you have a crypto wallet, we can, on a peer-to-peer basis, exchange value in the same way we did with MP3 files — not me, because I’m an IP lawyer, so I don’t believe in “sharing.”</p><p>这很有趣，因为当我想到公司之前的加密生活时，它的全部目的是分散——没有一个集中的、更正式的结构来实际交付“产品”这与加密技术的起源、原始精神和精神是背道而驰的，“我们可能彼此不认识或不信任对方。我们不信任政府。我们不信任大企业。我们将信任代码。我们将在所有这些不同的计算机上共享这些通用代码，然后它将不受攻击。它将在传统系统外工作。”互联网的某些部分以及Web1和Web2也是这样构建的。当你在谈论监管的影响，也许是缺乏监管环境的感觉时，我并不完全认同这一点。我知道，如果我有一个加密钱包，而你有一个加密钱包，我们可以在点对点的基础上，以与MP3文件相同的方式交换价值——而不是我，因为我是一名IP律师，所以我不相信“共享”</p><p> See, I was a bad copyright lawyer because I represented the kids who got sued for using Kazaa.</p><p>我是个糟糕的版权律师，因为我代表那些因使用Kazaa而被起诉的孩子。</p><p> And then I was like, “This is very depressing. I need to do something else with my life.”</p><p>然后我说，“这太令人沮丧了。我需要用我的生活做些别的事情。”</p><p> Right? I read all these great cases and we think of Napster, Grokster, and Kazaa — now I know! But your point is well made. I attribute it more to startups and entrepreneurial endeavors where you move fast, you break shit, and then you figure it out after that. The cost of doing business and the overhead certainly is not just for traditional corporate structures, but more likely for entrepreneurs. The speed at which technology moves — it’s moving at this meteoric pace now. I liken it almost to birth pangs. We’re getting closer and closer and closer to something really epic and really big. It’s moving so fast, so we don’t really have time to sit around for two or three or 10 years for Congress to pass legislation or judges to render decisions. That’s just the speed of technology. This is no exception, because this is a technological innovation impacting and disrupting financial markets, as well as virtually every other sector in some form or fashion. Blockchain and/or crypto assets are having an impact, and it’s just moving really fast.</p><p>正当我读了所有这些伟大的案例，我们想到了纳普斯特、格罗斯特和卡扎——现在我知道了！但你的观点说得很好。我把它更多地归因于创业和创业努力，在这些努力中，你行动迅速，破釜沉舟，然后你找到了答案。做生意的成本和管理费用当然不仅仅是传统企业结构的成本，更可能是企业家的成本。技术发展的速度——现在正以如此惊人的速度发展。我几乎把它比作分娩的痛苦。我们越来越接近一个真正伟大的史诗。它进展如此之快，所以我们真的没有时间坐在国会通过立法或法官做出决定的两三年或十年时间里。这就是技术的速度。这也不例外，因为这是一项以某种形式或方式影响和扰乱金融市场以及几乎所有其他行业的技术创新。区块链和/或加密资产正在产生影响，而且进展非常快。</p><p> I think you make a good distinction between cryptocurrencies and crypto assets. There’s Bitcoin and Ethereum and other stores of monetary value, and they need to be regulated like money. But when you say crypto assets, you’re talking about inclusive of NFTs, inclusive of other crypto products, inclusive of DAOs. Those to me are in an even wilder West: you threaten the big banks. You threaten the United States Federal. The action’s happening — the train’s on its way. You threaten the sort of normative copyright system that we have in this country. Maybe nothing happens for a long time until you piss off Disney. There’s no action there.</p><p>我认为你很好地区分了加密货币和加密资产。比特币、以太坊和其他具有货币价值的商店，它们需要像货币一样受到监管。但当你说加密资产时，你指的是NFT，包括其他加密产品，包括DAO。对我来说，这些都是在一个更加狂野的西方：你威胁着大银行。你威胁美国联邦政府。行动正在发生——火车正在赶来。你威胁到了我们国家那种规范的版权制度。也许很长一段时间内什么事都不会发生，除非你惹恼了迪士尼。那里没有行动。</p><p> That, to me, seems like where I see NFTs and DAOs just stumble over and over again: when they come into contact with the existing regulatory structures. When an NFT product comes into contact with copyright law, something bad happens. When a DAO comes into contact with general partnership law, something bad happens. Why do you think there’s a gap between entrepreneurs and their ability to innovate out of these humps?</p><p>在我看来，这似乎是我看到NFT和DAO一次又一次绊倒的地方：当它们接触到现有的监管结构时。当NFT产品接触到版权法时，坏事就发生了。当DAO接触到普通合伙法时，就会发生一些不好的事情。为什么你认为企业家和他们走出困境的创新能力之间存在差距？</p><p> I think we didn’t do a good enough job. By we, I mean big business and all of the IP issues, generally — copyright issues in particular. You know them very well from the Web2 world where peer-to-peer technologies brought all the copyright infringement to the yard. It was a lot of the nomenclature around sharing. It was also all of the, I think ridiculous, suits coming from the music industry in particular and from other industries.</p><p>我觉得我们做得不够好。我们指的是大企业和所有的知识产权问题，尤其是版权问题。你在Web2世界中非常了解他们，在那里，点对点技术将所有侵犯版权的行为带到了院子里。这是很多关于分享的术语。我认为，这也是所有特别来自音乐行业和其他行业的诉讼的荒谬之处。</p><p>    It’s unbelievable. We’ll sue you if you’re 13 or 92 and everybody in between, which is really terrible for the music industry. That’s a classic example of winning the battle and certainly losing the war. You saw other sectors within the industry kind of sitting on the sidelines to figure out that even if, technically, they were correct on the issues of law, it might be terrible for business for them to go and pursue it. You have other concerns — maybe perhaps as a matter of trademark, where you have an affirmative duty to police your mark. You don’t really have that affirmative duty on the copyright side, and there’s a lot of acceptable levels of infringement for the purpose of engaging with consumers. We saw a lot of that play itself out in Web2, but also the stage was set for the average person’s understanding and relationship to copyrighted information.</p><p>难以置信。如果你年满13岁或92岁，而所有人都在13岁或92岁之间，我们会起诉你，这对音乐行业来说真的很糟糕。这是一个打赢这场战争，当然输掉这场战争的经典例子。你看到行业内的其他部门坐在一旁，想弄明白，即使从技术上讲，他们在法律问题上是正确的，但他们去追求法律对企业来说可能是可怕的。你还有其他的顾虑——也许是商标问题，你有义务监督你的商标。在版权方面，你实际上没有这种肯定的义务，而且为了与消费者接触，有很多可以接受的侵权程度。我们在Web2中看到了很多这样的场景，但同时也为普通人对版权信息的理解和关系搭建了舞台。</p><p> The whole lack of understanding between what it means to have fair use or public domain works when they are terms of art. You and I know they are terms of art. They have a specific definition. But some people will think that if it’s on the internet, it must be free: “If I can right-click and save it, then I can use it.” The advent of social media allows us to copy things, share things. When you think of the 106 rights of being able to reproduce, to copy, to distribute, to prepare adaptations, all of these adaptive works or what we would call derivative works, or the ability to publicly display or perform — all of that is commonly done with social media. The connection to ownership versus the ability to license and use, I think, is just not understood by most people.</p><p>在艺术术语中，对合理使用或公共领域作品的含义缺乏理解。你我都知道这是艺术术语。它们有一个特定的定义。但有些人会认为，如果它在互联网上，它必须是免费的：“如果我可以右键单击并保存它，那么我就可以使用它。”社交媒体的出现让我们可以复制、分享东西。当你想到能够复制、复制、发行、准备改编的106种权利时，所有这些改编作品或我们称之为衍生作品，或者公开展示或表演的能力——所有这些通常都是通过社交媒体实现的。我认为，大多数人并不理解所有权与许可和使用能力之间的关系。</p><p> Then transfer that into the non-fungible token space where the token isn’t the creativity, but it’s connected to the creativity. It’s this idea of some digital representation of some right or connection to something else. The way that we talk about it commonly now is something creative or something collectible, and so we’re just running up against it again with new technology. It presents some of the old questions that weren’t adequately resolved — just with another iteration of technology.</p><p>然后将其转移到不可替换的标记空间，其中标记不是创造力，但它与创造力相连。这是对某种权利或与其他事物的联系进行数字表示的想法。我们现在通常谈论它的方式是一些有创意的东西或是一些可收藏的东西，所以我们只是在用新技术再次与之对抗。它提出了一些没有得到充分解决的老问题——只是通过技术的另一次迭代。</p><p>  So one of our main ideas at   The Verge  comes from our features editor Sarah Jeong: that the only functional law on the internet is copyright law. It’s the only legal regime that everyone recognizes exists and can actually lead to results. You want YouTube or Facebook or Twitter to take something down, and if you come at it in any direction other than copyright law, your chances of success are not assured. If you come at it through copyright law, you can just open the DMCA portal and request a takedown and YouTube will probably do it. That law has a real power on the internet in a way that almost everything else does not. Everything gets filtered through the lens of copyright, whether or not it’s appropriate. We see that pattern play out over and over again.</p><p>因此，我们即将发表的一个主要观点来自我们的特写编辑Sarah Jeong：互联网上唯一的功能法是版权法。这是唯一一个所有人都承认存在的法律制度，它实际上可以带来结果。你想让YouTube、Facebook或Twitter删除一些内容，如果你从版权法以外的任何方向着手，你成功的机会都不确定。如果你是通过版权法来解决这个问题的，你可以打开DMCA门户并请求删除，YouTube可能会这么做。这项法律在互联网上有着真正的影响力，几乎所有其他法律都没有这种影响力。一切都会从版权的角度进行过滤，不管它是否合适。我们看到这种模式反复出现。</p><p> I think we see it play out with consumers. I think the average consumer is more aware of YouTube’s DMCA policies or TikTok’s music rights policies than they’re aware of their local traffic laws, because they encounter the application of a regulatory system in their lives over and over and over again.</p><p>我认为我们看到了消费者的反应。我认为普通消费者更了解YouTube的DMCA政策或TikTok的音乐权利政策，而不是当地的交通法规，因为他们在生活中一次又一次地遇到监管体系的应用。</p><p> It took a long time to get there. Obviously, these platforms didn’t want to do it because they felt it was bad for business and they didn’t want to be the copyright police. We went through all of that with six strikes, or three strikes. But the advertising around DMCA — people may not even know what it stands for, but they know that acronym for sure because a lot of people were getting DMCA takedowns for all of the stuff they were sharing. That, coupled with the fact that people aren’t reading terms and conditions. That connection makes it very, very real for people in ways that pure contract law or other types of regulatory or legal regimes, they don’t come into contact.</p><p>到那里花了很长时间。显然，这些平台不想这样做，因为他们觉得这样做对业务不利，他们不想成为版权警察。我们以六次或三次的打击完成了这一切。但围绕DMCA的广告——人们可能甚至不知道它代表什么，但他们肯定知道这个缩写，因为很多人分享的所有东西都会被DMCA删除。再加上人们没有阅读条款和条件。这种联系使人们非常、非常真实地接触到纯粹的合同法或其他类型的监管或法律制度。</p><p> They can have all the advertising in the world. No one cares unless there are consequences. There were significant consequences for the platforms. They wanted to take advantage of [the DMCA’s] safe harbors, so they were pushing that down to the consumer. They tried kind of the nice way, but then you are going to get a notice. After a few notices, you’re not going to be able to access not only our product or our platform, but the interweb. That will get people’s attention for sure. That was before obviously the pandemonium and the essential nature of having access to broadband technology.</p><p>他们可以拥有世界上所有的广告。除非有后果，否则没人在乎。这对平台产生了重大影响。他们想利用（DMCA）的安全港，所以他们把这一点推给了消费者。他们尝试了一种很好的方式，但你们会得到通知。几次通知之后，你将无法访问我们的产品或平台，也无法访问互联网。这肯定会引起人们的注意。这显然是在混乱和宽带技术的本质到来之前。</p><p> So that’s the DMCA. By the way, you’re correct. We didn’t even say what it stands for.</p><p>这就是DMCA。顺便说一句，你说得对。我们甚至没说它代表什么。</p><p> Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Everyone who listens now will get the A for the day. If you actually take nothing away from this interview, please know what DMCA stands for.</p><p>《数字千年版权法》。每个现在听的人今天都会得到A。如果你真的没有从这次采访中得到什么，请知道DMCA代表什么。</p><p>   You can make a strong case that copyright is the only operative law on the internet as most people experience it. NFT is just like the Wild West: people are copying one another’s NFTs. There’s copy minting, where an NFT project takes off and somebody immediately just takes all the files and recopies them. There’s the generalized willful ignorance of copyright law existing from some NFT projects to begin with where the project leads are just using other people’s trademarks and works to make NFTs. Then they get lawyers and they complain that they’re being censored.</p><p>你可以有力地证明，版权是互联网上唯一有效的法律，因为大多数人都经历过它。NFT就像狂野的西部：人们在复制彼此的NFT。还有复制制作，一个NFT项目启动后，有人立即拿走所有文件并重新复制。在一些NFT项目中，存在着对版权法的普遍故意忽视，项目的领导者只是使用他人的商标和作品来制作NFT。然后他们找律师，抱怨他们被审查了。</p><p> It’s nuts to me, but it’s a real thing that happens. Why do you think that there is that willful ignorance of the underlying copyright law? To some extent, that’s what makes NFT valuable — the idea that you have a work that you can restrict the right to copy.</p><p>这对我来说很疯狂，但这是真的。你为什么认为人们故意无视基本的版权法？从某种程度上说，这就是NFT的价值所在——你的作品可以限制复制权。</p><p> Yeah. It’s just a ton of speculation and it’s pure greed for money. When you think of art for art’s sake, there is a decided portion of the NFT space that is focused on the culture — focused on not just art, but also the value that comes from just owning something of value that you want to collect, not flip like it’s another token. We have a lot of speculators in the fungible token space, just meaning the Bitcoins and the Ethereums of the world — fungibility, long story short, just means interchangeable. So if you use the example of a dollar or a Bitcoin or an ETH — it doesn’t matter which one, so we’ll use physical cash because it’s easier to make the analogy. It doesn’t matter which dollar, even though they all have serial numbers on them, because they all have the same value. Non-fungible tokens are unique and have the potential to have extraordinary value. We’ve seen some that go for $69 million and everybody’s swinging for the fences for that one. It’s so easy to do. Ever since the late ‘90s with digital technology, peer-to-peer technology, the internet — the state of the technology makes it incredibly easy to make these near-perfect or perfect digital copies and sell them very quickly as well, on the OpenSeas of the world. Yes, I said it.</p><p>是 啊这只是大量的投机，纯粹是对金钱的贪婪。当你为了艺术而思考艺术时，NFT空间中有一个确定的部分是专注于文化的——不仅专注于艺术，还专注于仅仅拥有你想要收藏的有价值的东西而产生的价值，而不是像另一个象征一样翻转。我们在可替代代币领域有很多投机者，只是指比特币和世界上的以太坊——可替代性，长话短说，只是指可互换性。因此，如果你使用美元、比特币或ETH的例子——哪一种并不重要，所以我们将使用实物现金，因为这更容易进行类比。哪一美元无关紧要，尽管它们上面都有序列号，因为它们都有相同的价值。不可替代代币是独一无二的，具有非凡价值的潜力。我们已经看到了一些价值6900万美元的产品，每个人都在为这一款摇旗呐喊。这很容易做到。自上世纪90年代末以来，随着数字技术、点对点技术和互联网的发展，技术的发展使得制作这些近乎完美或完美的数字拷贝并在世界公海迅速销售变得极其容易。是的，我说了。</p><p> There are several different types of minting platforms and sales platform environments, and each has its own approach to what is going to be offered for sale on their platform. We have DMCA takedowns going on, but it takes a long time to do.</p><p>有几种不同类型的造币平台和销售平台环境，每种平台都有自己的销售方式。我们正在进行DMCA测试，但这需要很长时间。</p><p> By that time, the NFT may have already sold. This NFT that’s connected to  infringed-upon art has sold a lot of different times. We have the problem of not readily being able to identify folks; although crypto and having a public wallet is pseudonymous, it’s not anonymous in the great majority of cases, so that’s a bit of a misunderstanding.</p><p>到那时，NFT可能已经售出。这个与侵权艺术品有关的NFT在不同时期都有销售。我们有一个问题，就是不能轻易地识别出人们；虽然加密和拥有公共钱包是假名，但在大多数情况下都不是匿名的，所以这有点误解。</p><p> It happens quickly. People flip it. People grab the money and run, and it’s a little more difficult — at least on the front end — to be able to hunt it down. I find that to be the bigger issue, or at least the issue you mentioned earlier with Web2. Again, it’s like on gas now. It’s just going at a much faster burn rate. The consequences are big because of the money, at least the potential for money that’s involved. Those platforms are going to have to tighten up their game.</p><p>它发生得很快。人们把它翻过来。人们抢了钱就跑，要想找到它就有点困难了——至少在前端是这样。我发现这是一个更大的问题，或者至少是你之前在Web2中提到的问题。再说一次，现在就像在加油。它只是以更快的速度燃烧。其后果是巨大的，因为资金，至少是涉及资金的潜力。这些平台将不得不收紧游戏。</p><p> This has happened kind of in a Web 2.0 space: photographers got together and filed a class action suit last year.
