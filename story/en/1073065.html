He dialed a private line to his trading desk in New Jersey, just as he did a dozen times each day.</p><p>佛罗里达州博卡拉顿——当利昂·库伯曼拿起电话查看自己赚了多少钱时，股市只开放了17分钟。他在新泽西州的交易台拨了一条私人电话，就像他每天拨十几次一样。</p><p> “Fine. Thank you. Let’s keep holding steady,” said Cooperman, 78. He hung up and watched a stock graph on his computer screen as it rose from one minute to the next, charting another good day to be a billionaire in America. Outside the office, he could see his wife leaving to play in her weekly bridge game and a group of golfers strolling past on a private course. He’d chosen to live in Florida for at least 183 days each year in part to benefit from the state’s low tax rate for residents, and from 7 a.m. until midnight he was typically seated at the desk in his office, managing the more than $2.5 billion he’d made during a career as an investor and a hedge fund manager.</p><p>“很好。谢谢。让我们保持稳定，”78岁的库伯曼说。他挂断电话，看着电脑屏幕上的股票图表从一分钟上升到下一分钟，为在美国成为亿万富翁描绘了又一个美好的日子。在办公室外，他可以看到他的妻子离开去参加每周的桥牌比赛，一群高尔夫球手在一个私人球场上漫步而过。他选择每年至少在佛罗里达州居住183天，部分原因是为了从该州居民的低税率中获益。从早上7点到午夜，他通常坐在办公室的办公桌旁，管理着他作为投资者和对冲基金经理职业生涯中赚得的25多亿美元。</p><p> He’d been earning more than his family could spend since about 1975, and in the decades since then he’d come to see the act of making money less as a personal necessity than as a serious game he could play and win. He invested it, traded it, lent it, gave it away and watched each day as the accounts continued to grow beyond his needs, his wants and sometimes even his own comprehension.</p><p>大约从1975年起，他的收入就超过了家人的支出，在此后的几十年里，他开始把赚钱看作是一种严肃的游戏，而不是一种个人必需品。他投资、交易、出借、送出，每天看着账户不断增长，超出他的需求、欲望，有时甚至超出他自己的理解。</p><p>   “I don’t want to say it’s all play money at this point, but what else could I possibly spend it on?” he sometimes wondered. His wife’s walk-in closet was already bigger than the South Bronx apartment where he’d grown up. Their Florida home had a custom-built infinity pool, and in five years he’d never once gone in for a swim.</p><p>“我不想说这一切都是玩钱，但我还能把钱花在什么地方呢？”他有时想知道。他妻子的步入式衣柜已经比他长大的南布朗克斯区公寓大了。他们在佛罗里达州的家里有一个定制的无限泳池，五年来他从未游泳过。</p><p>   “Very good, yeah. The highfliers are getting killed, but the value stocks are doing great. You’re up about 10 million.”</p><p>“非常好，是的。高端股正在被杀，但价值股表现不错。你涨了大约1000万。”</p><p> The past year had been the best time in history to be one of America’s 745 billionaires, whose cumulative wealth has grown by an estimated 70 percent since the beginning of the pandemic even as tens of millions of low-wage workers have lost their jobs or their homes. Together, those 745 billionaires are now worth more than the bottom 60 percent of American households combined, and each day Cooperman could see that gap widening on his balance sheet — up an average of $4,788 per minute in the stock market, $1.9 million per day and $700 million total in 2021. As a record amount of wealth continued to shift toward a tiny fraction of people at the pinnacle of the economy, Cooperman could sense something else shifting, too.</p><p>过去的一年是美国745位亿万富翁中历史上最美好的一年。自疫情爆发以来，尽管数千万低薪工人失去了工作或家园，但他们的财富累计增长了约70%。总之，这745位亿万富翁现在的价值比美国家庭的底部60%的总和还要多，每天库珀都能看到他的资产负债表上的差距扩大了——平均每分钟4788美元在股票市场，每天190万美元，总额7亿美元在2021。随着创纪录的财富继续向经济巅峰时期的一小部分人转移，库伯曼也能感觉到其他一些变化。</p><p> “Billionaires shouldn’t even exist in America,” read one note he’d received after he went on TV to recommend stock picks.</p><p>“亿万富翁在美国根本不应该存在，”他在电视上推荐选股后收到的一张纸条上写道。</p><p> “One day, we’re coming after all of you with pitchforks,” read another message.</p><p>“总有一天，我们会用干草叉追上你们所有人，”另一条消息写道。</p><p> “Wake up, moron. YOU and your insatiable greed are at the root of our biggest societal problems.”</p><p>“醒醒，白痴。你和你永不满足的贪婪是我们最大的社会问题的根源。”</p><p>   He responded to most of the personal emails, kept record of the occasional death threats and wrote letters to politicians such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) whenever they criticized billionaires in their speeches, because he couldn’t understand: What exactly had he done wrong? What rule had he broken? He’d been born to poor immigrant parents on the losing end of a capitalist economy. He’d attended public schools, taken on debt to become the first in his family to attend college, worked 80-hour weeks, made smart decisions, benefited from some good luck, amassed a fortune for himself and for his clients and paid hundreds of millions in taxes to the government. He had a wife of 57 years, two successful children, and three grandchildren who were helping him decide how to give most of his money away to a long list of charities. “My life is the story of the American Dream,” he’d said while accepting an award at one charity gala, and he’d always imagined himself as the rags-to-riches hero, only to now find himself cast as the greedy villain in a story of economic inequality run amok.</p><p>他回复了大部分私人电子邮件，记录了偶尔的死亡威胁，并给参议员伊丽莎白·沃伦（D-Mass.）等政客写信，参议员伯尼·桑德斯（I-Vt.）和众议员亚历山大·奥卡西奥·科尔特斯（D-N.Y.）每次在演讲中批评亿万富翁，因为他不明白：他到底做错了什么？他违反了什么规则？他出生于贫穷的移民家庭，父母都生活在资本主义经济的衰落中。他上过公立学校，背负债务成为家里第一个上大学的人，每周工作80小时，做出明智的决定，从好运中获益，为自己和客户积累了财富，并向政府缴纳了数亿美元的税款。他有一位57岁的妻子，两个成功的孩子，还有三个孙子孙女，他们帮助他决定如何把大部分钱捐给一长串慈善机构。“我的生活就是美国梦的故事，”他在一次慈善晚会上领奖时说，他一直把自己想象成一个白手起家的英雄，但现在却发现自己在一个经济不平等肆虐的故事中扮演了贪婪的恶棍。</p><p> And now came another series of emails from a stranger who ran a charity in New Jersey. She said billionaires were avoiding paying their fair share of taxes by using loopholes in the tax code. She said their legacy of excessive wealth was “burdening future generations.” She said Cooperman had no idea what it was like to live in poverty or to choose each month between paying rent or buying food.</p><p>现在又收到了一封来自一位在新泽西州经营慈善机构的陌生人的电子邮件。她说，亿万富翁利用税法中的漏洞逃避缴纳他们应得的税款。她说，他们遗留下来的过多财富“给子孙后代带来了负担”她说，库伯曼不知道生活在贫困中是什么感觉，也不知道每个月在付房租和买食物之间做出选择是什么感觉。</p><p> “She makes decent points,” Cooperman said as he read the email again, and it made him think back to a question he’d begun wondering about himself: In a time of historic inequality, what were the moral responsibilities of a billionaire?</p><p>“她说得很有道理，”库伯曼再次阅读邮件时说，这让他回想起自己开始思考的一个问题：在一个历史性的不平等时代，亿万富翁的道德责任是什么？</p><p> “Thank you for your emails. It might be helpful for me to provide you with some background about myself,” he wrote back, and then he attached a short biography and copies of his letters to politicians. “There seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding of who I am.”</p><p>“谢谢你的电子邮件。我向你提供一些关于我自己的背景可能会有所帮助，”他回信说，然后他附上了一本简短的传记和他写给政客的信的副本。“人们似乎对我是谁存在根本性的误解。”</p><p>   He knew what people imagined when they thought of a billionaire. He’d read the stories of excess and extravagance and witnessed some of it firsthand, but that wasn’t him. He didn’t spend $238 million on a New York penthouse like hedge fund manager Ken Griffin; or vacation at his own private island in Belize like Bill Gates; or throw himself $10 million birthday parties featuring camels and acrobats like investor Stephen Schwarzman; or drop $70,000 a year on hair care like Donald Trump; or buy a preserved 14-foot shark for an estimated $8 million like Steven Cohen; or spend more than $1 billion on art like media mogul David Geffen; or budget $23 million for personal security like Facebook did for Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>当人们想到亿万富翁时，他知道他们的想法。他读过关于奢侈和奢侈的故事，亲眼目睹了其中一些，但那不是他。他没有花2.38亿美元购买像对冲基金经理肯·格里芬那样的纽约顶层公寓；或者像比尔·盖茨一样在伯利兹自己的私人岛屿度假；或者给自己开1000万美元的生日派对，邀请骆驼和投资人斯蒂芬·施瓦茨曼（Stephen Schwarzman）等杂技演员参加；或者像唐纳德·特朗普那样每年花7万美元在头发护理上；或者像史蒂文·科恩那样，花800万美元买一条14英尺长的鲨鱼；或者在媒体大亨大卫·格芬（David Geffen）这样的艺术作品上花费超过10亿美元；或者像Facebook为马克·扎克伯格（Mark Zuckerberg）做的那样，为个人安全预算2300万美元。</p><p> He didn’t have his own spaceships like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos; or a 600-foot flying airship like Sergey Brin; or a decommissioned Soviet fighter jet like Larry Ellison; or a $215 million yacht with a helipad and a pool like Steve Wynn; or a private train with three staterooms like John Paul DeJoria; or a $5 million luxury car collection like Kylie Jenner.</p><p>他没有像埃隆·马斯克和杰夫·贝佐斯那样拥有自己的宇宙飞船；或者像谢尔盖·布林这样的600英尺飞艇；或者像拉里·埃里森这样退役的苏联战斗机；或者是一艘价值2.15亿美元的游艇，配有直升机停机坪和史蒂夫·韦恩（Steve Wynn）那样的游泳池；或者像约翰·保罗·德乔里亚这样有三间头等舱的私人火车；或者像凯莉·詹纳这样500万美元的豪华车收藏。</p><p> What Cooperman had for transportation was a 25-year-old Schwinn bicycle he liked to ride around the neighborhood and a Hyundai he used for running errands a few times each week.</p><p>库伯曼的交通工具是一辆25岁的施温自行车，他喜欢在社区里骑，还有一辆现代车，他每周用它跑几次差。</p><p> He rechecked the stock graph on his screen and picked up his phone to call his wife, Toby, who was sitting in her office suite down the hall.</p><p>他重新检查了屏幕上的股票图表，拿起手机给坐在楼下办公室套间里的妻子托比打电话。</p><p> “I’m going to head out and grab some of those Costco lamb chops later,” he told her.</p><p>他告诉她：“我一会儿就要出去买几块好市多羊排了。”。</p><p>  “I don&#39;t think so,” he said. “I’ll just see what’s on special.”</p><p>“我不这么认为，”他说。“我看看有什么特别节目。”</p><p> They’d been together since they met at Hunter College in 1962, when tuition at the public New York university cost as little as $24 per semester and the promise of a life in America was that each generation would surpass the one before. She was the daughter of a struggling pillowcase salesman from Romania; he was the son of a plumber’s apprentice who emigrated from Poland at age 13, never finished high school, worked six days a week and later died of a heart attack while carrying a sink up the stairs of a fourth-story apartment.</p><p>1962年，他们在亨特学院相遇。当时，纽约公立大学的学费每学期仅为24美元，而在美国生活的承诺是每一代人都将超越前一代。她是罗马尼亚一名苦苦挣扎的枕套推销员的女儿；他是一名管道工学徒的儿子，13岁时从波兰移民过来，从未完成高中学业，每周工作六天，后来在搬水槽上四层公寓楼梯时死于心脏病发作。</p><p>   His father left behind an estate worth less than $100,000, but Cooperman also inherited his father’s belief that the economic ladder between poor and rich was short enough to climb with determination and hard work. More than 90 percent of children born in the United States during the 1940s would go on to out-earn their parents; two-thirds of those born into poverty would rise into at least the middle class. Cooperman waited tables during the summers, worked for Xerox while he went to business school at night and then started as an analyst at Goldman Sachs making $12,500 a year. “My PhD is for poor, hungry and driven,” he liked to say. He told colleagues that capitalism was like a battle for survival in the African safari and that the key to success was to adopt the mind-set of a lion or a gazelle during a hunt. “When the sun comes up, you’d better be running,” Cooperman told them. Within nine years, he’d been named a partner. Within a decade, he was a millionaire.</p><p>他的父亲留下了一处价值不到10万美元的遗产，但库伯曼也继承了父亲的信念，即贫富之间的经济阶梯足够短，需要决心和努力才能攀登。20世纪40年代在美国出生的孩子中，超过90%的孩子的收入会超过父母；三分之二的贫困人口至少会进入中产阶级。库伯曼在夏天等桌子，晚上去商学院时为施乐工作，然后开始在高盛做分析师，年收入为12500美元。他喜欢说：“我的博士学位是为穷人、饥饿者和被驱使者准备的。”。他告诉同事们，资本主义就像非洲狩猎中的一场生存之战，成功的关键是在狩猎中采用狮子或瞪羚的思维方式。“当太阳升起的时候，你最好跑步，”库伯曼告诉他们。不到九年，他就被任命为合伙人。不到十年，他就成了百万富翁。</p><p> Together, he and Toby had learned how to be rich, which mostly meant deciding how not to spend their money. He still felt most comfortable shopping for clothes wholesale and commuting to work on New Jersey public transit. Toby enjoyed her job as a special-education teacher even if she didn’t need the $25 an hour, so she continued working and donated her salary back to the school. They bought a house for $325,000 in New Jersey in the 1980s and later built their $5 million home in Florida. They worried about demotivating their two children by giving them a massive inheritance, so instead they put a small fraction of their wealth into a trust that could be accessed only once their sons turned 35, at which point one was already a successful businessman and the other was an environmental scientist with a PhD.</p><p>他和托比一起学会了如何致富，这主要意味着决定如何不花钱。他仍然觉得最舒服的购物方式是服装批发和在新泽西公共交通上通勤。托比很享受她作为特殊教育教师的工作，即使她不需要每小时25美元，所以她继续工作，并把薪水捐给了学校。20世纪80年代，他们以32.5万美元的价格在新泽西州买了一套房子，后来在佛罗里达州建造了价值500万美元的住宅。他们担心给两个孩子一大笔遗产会降低他们的积极性，因此他们将自己财富的一小部分投入到一个信托基金中，只有在他们的儿子年满35岁时才能获得该信托基金，此时一个已经是一名成功的商人，另一个是一名拥有博士学位的环境科学家。</p><p> Cooperman eventually left Goldman Sachs to start his own hedge fund, Omega, and for two decades he compounded his millions at an average of 14 percent each year as the stock market soared, until he and Toby were among the wealthiest few hundred billionaires in the United States. They were invited to dinner in 2010 by Gates and Warren Buffett, who had just started a program called the Giving Pledge, asking billionaires to donate at least half of their money to charity, and the Coopermans committed that night.</p><p>库伯曼最终离开高盛，成立了自己的对冲基金欧米茄。20年来，随着股市飙升，他以平均每年14%的速度增加了数百万美元，直到他和托比跻身美国最富有的数百位亿万富翁之列。2010年，盖茨和沃伦·巴菲特（Warren Buffett）邀请他们共进晚餐，他们刚刚启动了一项名为“捐赠承诺”的计划，要求亿万富翁将至少一半的钱捐给慈善机构，库珀曼夫妇当晚做出了承诺。</p><p> “I could buy a Picasso for a hundred million, but it doesn’t turn me on, so then what?” Cooperman told them. “We live a very rational lifestyle. What better use is there for our money?”</p><p>“我可以花一亿美元买一幅毕加索画作，但它不能让我兴奋，那又怎样？”库伯曼告诉他们。“我们的生活方式非常理性。我们的钱有什么更好的用途？”</p><p> They’d given away $150 million to a hospital in New Jersey, $50 million for college scholarships to Newark high school students, $40 million to Columbia Business School, $40 million to Hunter College, $30 million to performing arts, $25 million to the Jewish Family Fund, $20 million to skilled nursing, $15 million to food banks, and on and on it went. But no matter how much they gave away, their money continued to make more money even as wages for the middle class remained essentially flat. In the past 50 years, the gap between poor families and the top 0.1 percent had increased more than tenfold. Children now had only a 43 percent chance of out-earning their parents.</p><p>他们向新泽西州的一家医院捐赠了1.5亿美元，向纽瓦克高中学生捐赠了5000万美元的大学奖学金，向哥伦比亚商学院捐赠了4000万美元，向亨特学院捐赠了4000万美元，向表演艺术捐赠了3000万美元，向犹太家庭基金捐赠了2500万美元，向专业护理捐赠了2000万美元，向食品银行捐赠了1500万美元，这件事一直持续下去。但不管他们捐了多少钱，即使中产阶级的工资基本持平，他们的钱仍在继续赚更多的钱。在过去50年里，贫困家庭与0.1%的顶层家庭之间的差距增加了10倍多。孩子们现在只有43%的机会超过父母。</p><p>   “Mr. Cooperman, your donation is needed to keep the American Dream off life support,” read one of the dozens of solicitations he received each day.</p><p>“库伯曼先生，你的捐款是让美国梦远离生命支持所必需的，”他每天收到的几十份请求中的一份写道。</p><p> “Mr. Cooperman, more than 11 million American children are now living in poverty …”</p><p>“库伯曼先生，现在有1100多万美国儿童生活在贫困之中……”</p><p>  “Mr. Cooperman, the pandemic has left 60 million families at risk of losing their homes …”</p><p>“库伯曼先生，这场大流行使6000万家庭面临失去家园的风险……”</p><p> He donated to more than 50 organizations each year and also to a number of people who wrote to him in personal distress. “Other than my family, writing checks is the most meaningful thing I do,” Cooperman said, and yet no matter how many zeros he included, it left him wanting to do more. “We’re going in the wrong direction in this country in so many depressing ways,” he said. He believed in the meritocratic ideal of capitalism — “equal opportunity if not equal results,” he said — but it seemed to him that the odds of success remained stacked by race, by gender and increasingly by economic starting position. Rates of intergenerational poverty had gone up in each of the past three decades. The most disadvantaged children were falling further behind. He believed from his own experience that a college education was the best answer, and yet tuition costs were continuing to skyrocket.</p><p>他每年向50多个组织捐款，也向一些在个人困境中写信给他的人捐款。“除了我的家人，开支票是我做的最有意义的事情，”库伯曼说，但不管他写了多少个零，这让他想做更多。他说：“在这个国家，我们在许多令人沮丧的方面走错了方向。”。他相信资本主义的精英主义理想——“如果不是平等的结果，机会也是平等的，”他说，但在他看来，成功的几率仍然是由种族、性别和越来越多的经济起点决定的。在过去30年中，代际贫困率每年都在上升。处境最不利的儿童正在进一步落后。根据自己的经验，他认为大学教育是最好的答案，但学费仍在飞涨。</p><p> “It’s not exactly a fair system until you even up the odds,” he said, and after looking over the list of worthy causes, he and Toby had decided that donating half of their money didn’t feel sufficient. Sixty percent wasn’t enough to meet the country’s needs. Neither was 75. So they’d agreed to set up a family foundation that would eventually give away more than 90 percent of their money, and Cooperman had decided that rather than retiring in earnest, he would continue to manage their account so there would be more to give away.</p><p>他说：“在你把赔率调平之前，这并不完全是一个公平的制度。”在查看了有价值的事业清单后，他和托比认为，捐献一半的钱是不够的。60%不足以满足国家的需求。两人都不是75岁。因此，他们同意建立一个家庭基金会，最终会捐出超过90%的资金，库珀曼决定，而不是认真退休，他将继续管理他们的帐户，所以将有更多的捐赠。</p><p> “He who dies rich dies disgraced,” read a quotation attributed to Andrew Carnegie on Cooperman’s office desk, but on this day he was still rich and getting richer. “What’s enough?” he wondered. “What’s the answer?” He checked the stock graph on his screen — up $2.6 million in the past five hours. His accounts were equal to the average net worth of 23,000 middle-class American families.</p><p>库伯曼办公桌上安德鲁·卡内基（Andrew Carnegie）的一句名言写道：“死得富有的人死得丢脸。”但在这一天，他仍然很富有，而且越来越富有。“什么够了？”他想知道。“答案是什么？”他查看了屏幕上的股票图表——在过去五个小时里上涨了260万美元。他的账户相当于23000个美国中产阶级家庭的平均净值。</p><p>    Each day when the stock market closed at 4 p.m., he checked the final numbers on his 40 stock holdings, reviewed his investment strategy for the next day and then left for a two-mile walk around the palm trees and putting greens of St. Andrews Country Club in Boca Raton. The community was set off from the surrounding suburbs by a canal, a gatehouse, a 10-foot wall and an infrared security system. A few of the 700 homes were owned by other billionaires, and most others belonged to millionaires who wintered in Florida. All of the residents had gotten richer during the pandemic as the luxury real estate market exploded and their home values surged by more than 40 percent.</p><p>每天下午4点股市收盘时，他都会查看自己持有的40只股票的最终数字，第二天回顾自己的投资策略，然后在棕榈树上散步两英里，在博卡拉顿的圣安德鲁斯乡村俱乐部（St.Andrews Country Club）种上果岭。社区与周围的郊区之间有一条运河、一座门房、一堵10英尺高的墙和一个红外安全系统。700套房子中有几套是由其他亿万富翁拥有的，其他大部分属于在佛罗里达过冬的百万富翁。在大流行期间，随着豪华房地产市场的爆炸式增长，所有居民都变得更加富有，他们的房价飙升了40%以上。</p><p> Cooperman walked past an old designer home that was being torn down and rebuilt into a new designer home. He continued up the road toward the clay tennis courts, the spa and the terraced clubhouse. A resident drove by in a new Bentley, and Cooperman waved and then watched the $200,000 car drive on. “You get a lot of people who show off their wealth,” he said, “but I could buy and sell that guy 100 times.”</p><p>库伯曼走过一处正在拆除并重建为新设计师住宅的老设计师住宅。他继续沿着这条路向粘土网球场、水疗中心和露台俱乐部走去。一位居民开着一辆新宾利车路过，库伯曼挥手，然后看着这辆价值20万美元的汽车继续行驶。“很多人都在炫耀自己的财富，”他说，“但我可以把那个家伙买卖100次。”</p><p> He and Toby had spent almost all of their time during the pandemic within the gates of St. Andrews, eating dinner outside at the clubhouse and playing cards with friends, but every few days they liked to go for a drive. Once, early in the pandemic, they’d driven to a quiet, nearby park only to find more than 150 cars lined up in the parking lot as people waited for bags of canned goods at an impromptu food bank. “Depressing and staggering in a country of such wealth,” Cooperman said, and it made him remember a poem his granddaughter had written and published when she was in middle school, called “Seven Miles,” about the physical proximity between the extreme wealth of Short Hills, N.J., where Cooperman had his other home, and the extreme poverty in nearby Newark. “At one end we have too much,” she’d written. “At the other, they have nothing. Spread it all just seven miles.”</p><p>疫情期间，他和托比几乎所有的时间都待在圣安德鲁斯的大门内，在俱乐部外面吃晚餐，和朋友们打牌，但每隔几天他们都喜欢开车出去兜风。有一次，在疫情早期，他们驱车前往附近一个安静的公园，却发现停车场里排着150多辆车，人们在一家临时食品银行等待罐装食品袋。库伯曼说，“在一个如此富有的国家，这让他感到沮丧和震惊。”这让他想起了孙女在中学时写并发表的一首诗，名为《七英里》，讲述了库伯曼另一个家所在的新泽西州肖特山的极端财富之间的物理距离，以及纽瓦克附近的极端贫困。“一端我们有太多，”她写道。“另一方面，他们什么都没有。把它们都分散到七英里以外的地方。”</p><p>   She’d gone on to graduate Phi Beta Kappa from Stanford, becoming an “ultraliberal, socialist type in favor of wealth redistribution,” Cooperman said. He adored her and admired both her empathy and her intellect, but he’d repeatedly fought against the liberal idea that one way to redistribute that wealth was to tax billionaires at a rate of 70 percent or more. He’d written to Sen. Warren about her “soak-the-rich positions,” and to President Barack Obama about “villainizing success.” He was a registered independent, and he’d voted for Joe Biden in the last election because he considered President Donald Trump a “would-be dictator whose comportment in office was beyond disgraceful,” but Cooperman believed most of all in the basic tenets of capitalism. He’d earned his money, and therefore it was his to spend or give away. He sent in a quarterly check for $10 million to the federal government in estimated taxes and said he paid an effective tax rate of 34 percent. He’d told politicians in his letters that he was willing to pay more, but he believed the highest effective tax rate should be no more than 50 percent.</p><p>库伯曼说，她后来从斯坦福大学毕业，成为“支持财富再分配的极端自由主义、社会主义类型”。他崇拜她，钦佩她的同情心和才智，但他多次反对自由派观点，即重新分配财富的一种方法是以70%或更高的税率向亿万富翁征税。他曾写信给沃伦参议员，说她“浸泡富人的职位”，并写信给奥巴马总统，说她“贬低成功”他是一名登记在册的独立人士，在上次选举中，他把票投给了乔·拜登，因为他认为唐纳德·特朗普总统是一个“在任时的行为极其可耻的潜在独裁者”，但库伯曼最相信的是资本主义的基本原则。他已经挣钱了，因此他有权花钱或捐钱。他每季度向联邦政府寄去一张1000万美元的支票，以估算税收，并表示他支付了34%的实际税率。他在信中告诉政界人士，他愿意支付更多，但他认为最高有效税率不应超过50%。</p><p> “What made America great is our system of capitalism, incentivizing work and effort and ingenuity,” he’d written. “Capitalism has flaws, but socialism has no benefits. Why not spread my work ethic instead of just my wealth?”</p><p>“使美国伟大的是我们的资本主义制度，它激励人们的工作、努力和创造力，”他写道。“资本主义有缺陷，但社会主义没有好处。为什么不传播我的职业道德，而不仅仅是我的财富？”</p><p> Now he looped around a cul-de-sac and turned back toward his house. For years, he’d been doing these daily walks with his brother, Howard, until he died in December at age 85, and lately Cooperman had been thinking back over their lives. Cooperman had chosen to wake up at 5:15 each morning and devote 80 hours every week to his work, taking off only the Friday after Thanksgiving. His brother, meanwhile, had chosen not to go to college and then retired as soon as he could. He preferred to play racquetball, go to the casino with friends and volunteer as a wheelchair transporter at the hospital. Cooperman had ended up with his billions and his name on top of the hospital entrance; his brother had died with relatively modest amounts of money but with a cellphone loaded with numbers for dozens of close friends.</p><p>现在，他绕过一条死胡同，转身向自己的家走去。多年来，他每天都和他的兄弟霍华德散步，直到去年12月去世，享年85岁。最近，库伯曼一直在回想他们的生活。库伯曼选择每天早上5:15起床，每周花80个小时工作，只在感恩节后的周五休息。与此同时，他的哥哥选择不上大学，然后尽快退休。他更喜欢打壁球，和朋友一起去赌场，并自愿在医院做轮椅运输员。库伯曼最终把他的数十亿美元和他的名字写在了医院入口处；他的兄弟去世时身价相对较低，但手机上有几十位好友的电话号码。</p><p> “We both got what we worked for,” Cooperman said. “We were best friends, and we admired what each other had, but it would have been wrong to take what I earned and given it all over to him.”</p><p>“我们都得到了我们努力的东西，”库伯曼说。“我们是最好的朋友，我们彼此都很欣赏对方拥有的东西，但把我赚来的钱都给他是不对的。”</p><p>  “Different choices, different outcomes,” he said. “The world isn’t meant to be totally even.”</p><p>“不同的选择，不同的结果，”他说。“世界并不意味着完全平等。”</p><p>    His choice: 12 more hours anchored to the chair in his office, monitoring the market and calling in to his trading desk again and again as the sun reflected off the swimming pool outside his window. The market fell. The market rose. He bought $3 million in distressed bonds. He gave another $5 million away to charity. He was $18 million up for the day. He was $6 million down. He was beating the market again by mid-morning, losing at lunch, winning an hour later, and then losing again. “Does it make any sense?” he asked himself, watching the numbers change on his screen. “To sit inside all day in front of a machine, making money I don’t need so I can give it to someone I don’t know?”</p><p>他的选择是：在他办公室的椅子上再呆上12个小时，监视市场，当太阳从他窗外的游泳池反射出来时，一次又一次地打电话到他的交易台。市场下跌。市场上涨。他购买了300万美元的不良债券。他又向慈善机构捐赠了500万美元。当天他筹得1800万美元。他跌了600万美元。他在凌晨再次击败市场，午餐时输了，一小时后赢了，然后又输了。“这有意义吗？”他看着屏幕上的数字变化，问自己。“整天坐在机器前赚钱，这样我就可以把钱给不认识的人？”</p><p> He’d been wondering since his brother’s death whether there were better ways to spend some of his time, so one afternoon before the stock market closed, he shut off his computer and drove a few miles outside the gates of St. Andrews to visit Florida Atlantic University. The school’s president had invited Cooperman to speak to a group of low-income college students about his career and his values.</p><p>自从他哥哥去世后，他一直在想，是否有更好的方式来消磨时间，所以在股市收盘前的一天下午，他关掉了电脑，驱车离开圣安德鲁斯的大门几英里去参观佛罗里达大西洋大学。学校校长邀请库伯曼向一群低收入大学生讲述他的职业和价值观。</p><p> “Believe it or not, I have a great deal of commonality with all of you,” Cooperman said as he stood at the lectern and looked out at the crowd of about 40 students from a university scholarship program much like the one Cooperman and his wife had started in New Jersey. Most were students of color who had been born to immigrant parents. All of them came from families with incomes of $30,000 or less. The students had been living on campus during the pandemic as some of their families were upended by layoffs, by evictions, by a Haitian earthquake, by a Dominican drought, by  coronavirus infections and covid-19 deaths.</p><p>“信不信由你，我和你们大家有很多共同之处，”库伯曼站在讲台前，看着一群来自大学奖学金项目的大约40名学生，他说，这与库伯曼和他的妻子在新泽西州开始的奖学金项目很像。大多数是有色人种学生，他们的父母是移民。他们都来自收入在3万美元或以下的家庭。学生们在2019冠状病毒疾病期间生活在校园里，因为他们的家庭被裁员、驱逐、海地地震、多米尼加干旱、冠状病毒感染和COVID-19死亡所取代。</p><p> “I can understand some of the challenges you’re facing right now,” Cooperman said, starting a short PowerPoint presentation about his journey from a one-bedroom apartment to the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans.</p><p>“我能理解你现在面临的一些挑战，”库伯曼说，他开始了一个简短的PowerPoint演示，讲述了他从一套一居室公寓到福布斯400富豪榜的历程。</p><p>   “I worked very hard. I wanted to win,” he told them as he flipped to the next slide.</p><p>“我非常努力。我想赢，”他一边告诉他们，一边翻到下一张幻灯片。</p><p> “I’m a great believer in capitalism,” he said. “We have the best economic system in the world.”</p><p>“我非常相信资本主义，”他说。“我们拥有世界上最好的经济体系。”</p><p> “How do you become wealthy?” he asked. “You develop a product or a service that people want. The world is better off for a Larry Ellison, a Bill Gates. Look at the jobs they created. Look at the good they did for the world. The attack on wealthy people makes no sense to me.”</p><p>“你是如何变得富有的？”他问道。“你开发了人们想要的产品或服务。对于拉里·埃里森和比尔·盖茨来说，世界更美好。看看他们创造的就业机会。看看他们为世界做的好事。对富人的攻击对我来说毫无意义。”</p><p> “I’m giving the money away,” he said. “It’s been my pledge, and my wife’s pledge, to give it all away.”</p><p>“我要把钱送人，”他说。“这是我的誓言，也是我妻子的誓言，把一切都奉献出去。”</p><p> He finished going through the slides and then asked for questions, and after a while a student in the center of the room raised her hand and waited for the microphone. She said she was also interested in a career in business, and she explained that one of the many barriers in her way was the start-up cost. “In Florida, you need $200,” she said.</p><p>他看完了幻灯片，然后问了一些问题。过了一会儿，教室中央的一个学生举起手，等待麦克风。她说，她也对商业职业感兴趣，她解释说，在她的道路上，许多障碍之一是创业成本。“在佛罗里达，你需要200美元，”她说。</p><p> “You’re going to need a lot more than that,” Cooperman said.</p><p>“你需要的远不止这些，”库伯曼说。</p><p> “I know,” she said. “I just mean two hundred to get the license, the paperwork, from zero.”</p><p>“我知道，”她说。“我的意思是200美元，从零开始获得许可证和文件。”</p><p> Cooperman looked at her for a moment and tried to imagine what it would mean to start again from zero, and what it would be like to ascend from poverty to extreme wealth not in the 1960s but in 2022, when that gap had multiplied 10 times. But he’</p><p>库伯曼盯着她看了一会儿，试图想象一下从零开始意味着什么，以及不是在20世纪60年代，而是在2022年，从贫困上升到极度富裕会是什么样子，当时的差距已经扩大了10倍。但他是</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/道德/">#道德</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/库伯曼/">#库伯曼</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
