By now, you know the story. Millions of retail investors made the stock soar by over 1,000 percent in January 2021. This brought disaster upon a handful of hedge funds that had bet on GameStop’s stock to drop. According to  Markets Insider, one analyst estimated losses in February of roughly $19 billion. The hedge fund Melvin Capital reportedly closed out its position after taking a drubbing of 51 percent. Another fund, Maplelane, lost 40 percent.</p><p> 我以前写过关于GameStop（GME），视频游戏和电子公司的狂热的前景。到目前为止，你知道这个故事。数百万零售投资者在1月2021年将股票飙升为超过1,000％。这会带来少量对冲基金的灾难，这些资金赌GameStop的股票下降。根据市场内幕，2月份的一个分析师估计损失约为190亿美元。据报道，对冲基金梅尔文资本在举行51％后封闭了其立场。另一个基金Maplelane失去了40％。</p><p>  The rally eventually subsided, and the stock fell, though it remains well above its original price. But as retail investors looked into the details in the aftermath, they found telltale signs of a common yet egregious trading fraud by major brokers and hedge funds, which evaded what could have been far bigger losses. What happened around GameStop can be explained only by massive counterfeiting of shares.</p><p>  最终会消退，股票下降，但它仍然远远高于其原始价格。但由于零售投资者在后果中查看了细节，他们发现了主要经纪人和对冲基金的常见但令人震惊的交易欺诈的迹象，这逃避了可能更大的损失。 GameStop周围发生的事情只能通过批量伪造股票来解释。</p><p>  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which along with other regulators could confirm whether the patterns seen in GameStop trading constitute fraud, has known about and largely ignored practices like this for years. The financial media also ignores this systemic corruption.</p><p>  与其他监管机构一起的证券和交易所委员会（SEC）可以确认GameStop交易中所看到的模式是否构成欺诈，已知多年来像这样的实践。金融媒体也忽略了这种系统腐败。</p><p>      The SEC allows traders to  short a stock, which means to sell it even if they don’t own it, hoping to buy it back later at a lower price and bank the difference. Short sellers borrow the stock, usually from a broker, who either has it in their inventory, borrows it from another broker, or vows to “locate” the stock when the time comes and cover the short.</p><p>      证券交易委员会允许交易员短暂股票，这意味着即使他们没有拥有它，也希望以较低的价格和银行稍后地回来。短款卖家借用股票，通常来自经纪人，他们要么在他们的库存中，借用它从另一个经纪人借用它，或者誓言，当时间来并覆盖短时间时，誓言“找到”库存。</p><p>  That promise is often fake. A broker handling several sellers will borrow synthetic or manufactured shares, or “locate” the same stocks for multiple shorts. Traders and brokers have been mildly sanctioned for this scam.</p><p>  该承诺通常是假的。经纪人处理几个卖家将借用合成或制造的股票，或“找到”多个短裤的相同股票。贸易商和经纪人对这个骗局有温和的制裁。</p><p>  Sellers are supposed to send shares to buyers within two days. If they don’t convey the stock, there is a failure to deliver (FTD). This is also known as naked short selling. Traders that have outstanding FTDs are required to transfer the shares within a given time and are restricted from selling short until then. This rule is massively ignored or finessed, and the penalties are minor.</p><p>  卖家应该在两天内向买家寄出股票。如果他们没有传达库存，则会失败（FTD）。这也被称为裸体卖空。拥有优秀FTD的交易员需要在给定时间内转移股票，并限制在此之前的销售短暂。这条规则是大规模忽视或善意的，惩罚很小。 </p><p>  The major GME short sellers had to cover their shorts at a time when the funds had shorted much more stock than existed and when owners with real shares weren’t selling, even at higher prices. They were threatened with a  short squeeze, with the price going so high that they cannot cover it with existing assets, and they get a margin call, a demand that additional money gets dropped into their brokerage account.</p><p>主要的GME短卖家在资金短缺的时间内覆盖他们的短裤，而不是现有的，并且当实际股票没有销售时，即使以较高的价格也是如此。他们受到短暂的挤压威胁，价格如此之高，他们无法通过现有资产涵盖它，他们得到保证金，需求额外的资金被丢弃到他们的经纪账户中。</p><p>  The short squeeze ended under peculiar circumstances. A January 28 spike in GME led Robinhood, the online broker that handled orders for many retail traders, to cut the buy option for the stock from its app. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told the House Financial Services Committee in February that he had discussed the trade restrictions with the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which clears public trades, after it made a $3 billion margin call.</p><p>  短挤压在特殊的情况下结束。 1月28日在GME LED Robinhood中飙升，为许多零售交易员处理订单的在线经纪人，从其应用中削减股票的购买选项。罗比赫首席执行官Vlad Tenev于二月告诉议院金融服务委员会，他讨论了与存款信托和清算公司（DTCC）的贸易限制，该​​公司在达到了30亿美元的保证金之后，该公司明确公开交易。</p><p>  Your donation keeps this site free and open for all to read. Give what you can...</p><p>  您的捐款将免费和打开此网站以阅读。给你能...</p><p> However, DTCC CEO Michael Bodson told the committee in May that “the decision to restrict trading really was internal to Robinhood, we did not have discussions about that.” He noted that with Robinhood, “the system worked.” It stopped the buys while the big traders continued to sell. GME that day hit $483, but then the price plummeted, and the short squeeze was over.</p><p> 然而，DTCC首席执行官Michael Bodson在5月份告诉委员会认为，“限制交易的决定确实是罗伯利的内部，我们没有关于这一点的讨论。”他指出，随着罗宾情谊，“该系统工作。”它停止了购买，而大型交易员继续出售。那天受到483美元的GME，但随后价格暴跌，短挤压结束了。</p><p>  Why would Robinhood shut down GME trading? It did not lose money on trades, because it did not have its own investments. The answer may be hidden in the murky relationships involving market makers and hedge funds.</p><p>  罗宾尼为什么要关闭GME交易？它没有赔钱，因为它没有自己的投资。答案可能隐藏在涉及市场制造商和对冲基金的混乱关系中。</p><p>  Citadel Securities, a market maker, handled Robinhood’s orders on a “pay for order flow” basis (it paid for orders routed to it), which equaled 40 percent of Robinhood’s revenue. Citadel Securities is a division of a company founded by billionaire Ken Griffin. Another division, the Citadel hedge fund, helped provide short seller Melvin Capital with nearly $3 billion in funds during the GME short squeeze. Citadel Securities would have the clout to persuade Robinhood to shut down trading, and the motive, given its other division’s investment in Melvin. (UPDATE: Robinhood COO James Swartwout stated in  sworn court testimony in February for a case in California that “no third party, including either Citadel or Citadel Securities, requested that Robinhood apply restrictions on stock or options trading or played any role” in the decision to limit trading.)</p><p>  Citadel Securities，一个市场制造商，处理了罗宾时代的订单，就“订单流量付费”的命令（它支付给它的订单），其中40％的罗比赫的收入。 Citadel Securities是一家由亿万富翁肯格里芬成立的公司部门。 Citadel对冲基金另一个部门，帮助在GME短挤压期间提供近30亿美元的卖家梅尔文资本。鉴于其在Melvin的投资，Citadel Securities将有利于侦探守旧的脚步，以及动机和动机。 （更新：2月份在二月的宣誓法院证词中陈述了罗宾科·雅各詹姆斯，在加州举行的案例，即“没有第三方，包括城堡或城堡证券，要求抢劫队在股票或期权交易或在决定中发挥任何作用的限制限制交易。）</p><p>  Citadel Securities also has a knack for running afoul of the trading laws. It has been fined 58 times in the last few years for violating trading regulations, many about naked short selling. In February 2021, the same time frame as the GME trades, Citadel Securities was fined $10,000 for failing to close out a failure to deliver of shares it had sold short.</p><p>  城堡证券也有一个竞争贸易法的诀窍。违反交易条例的过去几年已被罚款58次，许多关于赤裸的卖空。 2021年2月，与GME交易相同的时间框架，Citadel证券被罚款10,000美元，未能结束未能提供卖出的股票。 </p><p>    There are conflicting arguments about whether GME was a battle of long and short hedge funds, whether retail investors through Robinhood and other trading apps played a significant role, or maybe both.</p><p>关于GME是否是长期和短期对冲基金战役的矛盾，无论是通过舵手和其他贸易应用程序的零售投资者是否发挥了重要作用，也可能也是两者。</p><p>  Robert Shapiro, chairman of the economic advisory firm Sonecon and undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs under Bill Clinton, believes the war between hedge funds theory, with a healthy dose of “pump and dump” market manipulation and naked short selling. Shapiro has testified before the SEC and criticized it for failing to take effective measures against naked shorting.</p><p>  经济咨询公司SoneCon主席和弗拉特克林顿经济事务副业的罗伯特Shapiro董事长和商业副业，相信对冲基金理论之间的战争，具有健康的“泵和倾倒”的市场操纵和赤裸的短暂销售。 Shapiro在SEC之前作证并批评它未能对裸露的短路进行有效的措施。</p><p>  Writing in   Washington Monthly, Shapiro explained, “The nearly five-fold jump in GameStop’s average trading volume from July to December signaled that large institutional investors were buying [and selling] the stock … The wild swings in those share prices reflect hundreds of millions of shares being traded each day, mostly in big blocks and presumably from one hedge fund to another.” He estimated that some 20 million or more of the GameStop shorts were never borrowed and never delivered to their buyers.</p><p>  在华盛顿月刊中，夏皮罗解释说，“GameStop近五倍的跳跃从7月到12月的Parkestop的平均交易量来表示大型机构投资者正在购买[和销售]库存......这些股价中的野生波浪价格反映了数亿每天交易的股票，主要是大块，并从一个对冲基金到另一个对冲基金。“他估计，GameStop短裤的大约2000万或更多人从未借过，从未送到他们的买家。</p><p>  Additional documentation of the GameStop manipulation comes from a handful of people on the WallStreetBets spinoff site Superstonk, who have painstakingly analyzed filings to the SEC and FINRA (the brokers’ “self-regulator”), stock reports from Bloomberg, and other public sources. (“Stonk” is their hokey way of saying stock.) Much of the data reported here is taken from their posts, which are all public and verifiable.</p><p>  GameStop操作的其他文件来自Wallstreetbets Spinoff网站Superstonk的少数人，他们对SEC和Finra（经纪人的“自我监管机构”），来自彭博和其他公共来源的股票报告。 （“Stonk”是他们的霍特语方式。）这里报告的大部分数据来自他们的帖子，这些数据都是公共和可验证的。</p><p>   It’s important to note that only the SEC and the DTCC can get the trading documents that would show proof of any fraudulent scheme. But the Superstonk users, through publicly available data, detected patterns that make a strong case at least to investigate the matter.</p><p>   值得注意的是，只有SEC和DTCC可以获得将显示任何欺诈计划证明的交易文件。但是，通过公开的数据，Superstonk用户检测到制作强有力的模式，至少调查此事。</p><p>  For example, u/broccaaa, a Superstonk user, looked through SEC filings for funds with large GME positions. Big losers like Melvin and Maplelane had no shares in GME, and large puts, which are options to sell. According to u/broccaaa, this is a common characteristic in stocks with large unsettled trades, where the shares have not been transferred. He described it as “supportive evidence for naked short trades … around the end of December and early January short interest and fails to deliver were through the roof.”</p><p>  例如，U / Broccaaa，Superstonk用户，通过SEC申请提供了大型GME位置的资金。像Melvin和Maplelane这样的大输家在GME中没有股票，大型投放，这是出售的选择。根据U / Broccaaa的说法，这是股票中的常见特征，股票尚未转移。他将其描述为“裸体短途交易的支持证据...... 12月底和1月初短暂的兴趣，并且未能通过屋顶交付。”</p><p>  The  float is the number of shares a company has issued that are available for investors to trade. All the shares are held in the DTC (Depository Trust Company), the “vault” of the DTCC, and “owners” have only digital entitlements. In the run-up to the short squeeze, Bloomberg Terminal data routinely showed well over 100 percent of GME float held by institutions, not including retail investors. (This ramped down massively after the short squeeze.)</p><p>  浮动是公司发出的股份数量，可用于投资者进行交易。所有股份都在DTC（存款信托公司），DTCC的“Vault”，“业主”只有数字权利。在短期挤压的过程中，彭博终端数据经常出现超过100％的受机构持有的GME浮动，而不是零售投资者。 （在短挤压后，这速度迅速下降。） </p><p>  Some of the extra shares result from the fact that, during the time between a short sale and settlement, both parties have legitimate digital entitlements. And due to the nature of SEC filings, there could be double counting. But the evidence shows that many of those shares  never settled. The issue is fails to deliver.</p><p>一些额外的股份是由于，在短期销售和结算之间的时间内，双方都有合法的数字权利。由于SEC文件的性质，可能会有双重计数。但证据表明，许多股票从未解决过。该问题未能提供。</p><p>  Under SEC rules, shares of companies that fail to deliver in the previous five trading days are put on a “ threshold list.” GameStop’s first date on this list was September 22, 2020.</p><p>  根据SEC规则，未在前五个交易日内未能提供的公司的股份取决于“门槛清单”。 GameStop在此名单上的第一个日期是2020年9月22日。</p><p>  Shares failed in massive numbers in the following months, leading to GameStop being put on the threshold list for 39 days between December 8 and February 3, with hundreds of millions of shares failing to deliver.</p><p>  在接下来的几个月内，股票失败，导致Gamestop在12月8日和2月3日之间进行了39天的阈值清单，其中数亿股未能提供。</p><p>   How could GME be on the list for so long? Regulators have the authority to find out which brokers failed to deliver, facilitating naked shorts. But the DTCC has historically beaten back attempts to reveal naked short selling culprits, or even to tag “borrowed” shares (called the  hard borrow) so they can’t be “located” more than once. I’ve written previously about how DTCC  pulled back on backing a centralized database that would prevent the same shares from being used for multiple short sales.</p><p>   Gme如何在列表中进行这么长时间？监管机构有权了解哪些经纪人未能提供交付，促进裸体短裤。但DTCC历史悠久地击败了揭示裸卖罪魁祸首，甚至标记“借来的”股票（称为硬借款），所以他们不能“位于”不止一次。我以前写过关于DTCC如何回到支持集中式数据库，该数据库将阻止相同的股份用于多个短销售额。</p><p>  “There is no lawful way for a stock to be on the threshold list for months,” said John Welborn, who teaches economics at Dartmouth. “The only explanation is regulatory apathy, or worse.” Because compliant regulators choose not to track shorts, traders can engage in mischief.</p><p>  “股票在门槛清单上没有合法的方式，”John Welborn表示，在达特茅斯教授经济学。 “唯一的解释是监管冷漠或更糟。”因为兼容的监管机构选择不跟踪短裤，所以交易者可以从事恶作剧。</p><p>      In 2007, online retailer Overstock sued the major prime brokers for naked shorting its stock and creating counterfeit shares that flooded the market, causing its share price to drop from $70 to $20. It presented evidence that Goldman Sachs created fake inventory for stock lending.</p><p>      2007年，在线零售商卵形超越了主要的主要经纪人，为裸体缩短其股票，创造淹没市场的伪造股票，使其股价从70美元降至20美元。它提出了证据表明，高盛为股票贷款创造了假库存。</p><p>  Here’s how an insider described it in a  2011 Overstock court deposition: “A firm or a market maker would synthetically create a short position by doing option trades in it, buying the stock, selling a call or buying a put or this, that and the other. And by buying the stock, they could create a borrow off an option trade.”</p><p>  这是一个在2011年的overstock法院沉积中描述的内幕书籍：“公司或市场制造商将通过在其中的选择交易中综合创造一个短职位，购买库存，销售电话或购买投放或者这一情况其他。通过购买股票，他们可以创造借出期权贸易。“ </p><p>  In the conversion trade, an options market maker is on one side, and a prime broker on the other. It isn’t real market making, which is to be in the middle so all traders can buy or sell shares, or in this case, options. “The goal of the trade is to get the prime broker loanable inventory of stock,” Welborn said.</p><p>在转换贸易中，一个选项市场制造商在一方面，另一方面是一个主要经纪人。它不是真正的市场制作，即在中间，所以所有的交易者都可以买卖股票，或在这种情况下，选择。 “贸易的目标是获得贷款贷款库存库存，”韦尔博恩说。</p><p>  How do you get there? You get there by this conversion trick. First, the options market maker sells the prime broker a naked short that never settles from the market maker. This is “the most important leg of the trade,” Welborn explained. The market maker also sells a put option (an option to buy the stock in the future) to the broker. This gives the market maker a neutral position, but the broker can maintain a “long” position, as if they owned the stock.</p><p>  你怎么到那的？你通过这个转换伎俩到达那里。首先，选项市场制造商销售黄金经纪人一个从未从市场制造商那里腾出的裸体短片。这是“交易中最重要的一条队伍”，威尔本地解释道。市场制造商还销售了一份选项（将来购买股票的选项）到经纪人。这使得市场制造者成为中立位置，但经纪人可以保持“长”位置，好像他们拥有库存。</p><p>  The broker can now lend that stock out to multiple clients. In this way, the prime broker and the market maker are creating fake lendable shares out of thin air. The end result is organized counterfeiting of shares in the market.</p><p>  经纪人现在可以向多个客户提供该库存。通过这种方式，主要经纪人和市场制造商正在创造出薄空气中的假盈良股。最终结果是组织市场上股票的伪造。</p><p>  Regulators aren’t providing enough transparency to ferret it out. As Welborn said, “Regulators tell us there are fails but don’t tell us who did the fails. Liquor stores are being robbed, but they don’t tell us who robbed the stores.”</p><p>  监管机构没有提供足够的透明度来雪貂出来。作为韦尔博恩说，“监管机构告诉我们有失败但不要告诉我们谁没有失败。酒商店正在被抢劫，但他们并没有告诉我们谁抢劫了商店。“</p><p>  There is voluminous evidence from the  Overstock case of Goldman Sachs engaging in this practice, including an  email from a broker conceding that such conversion trades “create inventory to allow customers to short.” When Overstock got the incriminating evidence, after Goldman’s lawyer posted it by mistake on PACER, the federal court online filing system, Goldman settled with Overstock in 2015 for $20 million.</p><p>  来自Goldman Sachs的overstock案例有巨大的证据来自这种做法，包括一封来自经纪人的电子邮件，根据这种转换交易“创建库存，以允许客户缩短”。当霍尔曼·律师在Pacer犯错后，在联邦法院在线申请制度之前发布了令人费解的证据时，Goldman于2015年在2015年结算了2000万美元。</p><p>    An obvious sign of market manipulation is massive  short interest, the number of shares that have been sold short but not yet covered. These could be legally borrowed shares that were first located. However, GameStop did have more than 100 percent short interest, including 140 percent in January, which means more shares were reported as being short sold than all the shares that should be available to trade.</p><p>    市场操纵的明显迹象是巨大的短暂兴趣，已售出的股票数量短但尚未覆盖。这些可以在法律上借用首次定位的股份。然而，GameStop确实有超过100％的短暂兴趣，包括1月份的140％，这意味着更多的股份被报告为短售出的股票，而不是贸易的所有股票。</p><p>  u/rainforest11 of Superstonk explained that FINRA reported short interest at 226 percent of total float at the height of the GME frenzy in January. This means that more than twice as many shares as exist in reality had been sold short at one point. As late as January 28, it was reported by S3, a market data company, to be 122 percent.</p><p>  U / Rainforest11的Superstonk解释说，Finra报告了1月份GME狂热的高度的226％的226％的兴趣。这意味着现实中存在的两倍以上的股份已经出售了一点。截至1月28日，S3，市场数据公司的报告称，达到122％。 </p><p>  Counterfeit shares were likely used as “loans” to cover the naked short attacks that knocked down the share price. With short interest well above 100 percent of the float, there were not enough real shares to borrow. That is why there were fails to deliver to the buyers.</p><p>假冒股票可能被用作“贷款”，以涵盖击倒股价的裸体短暂攻击。短暂的浮点超过100％的浮点，没有足够的真实股票借钱。这就是为什么未能向买家提供。</p><p>  The chart below shows the percentage of GameStop shares that failed to deliver between the beginning of January 2020 and the end of January 2021. The FTDs, between 1 and 5 percent of total shares, may seem like small numbers, but as the website  Where Are the Shares asks, “Would it be okay if 1 percent, 2 percent, 4 percent of your bank deposits failed to show up?”</p><p>  下图表显示了GameStop股票的百分比，未能在2020年1月开始和2011年1月底之间提供的游戏股票。FTDS在总股份的1％和5％之间可能看起来像少数，而是作为网站股票问：“如果1％，2％，4％的银行存款未能出现？”</p><p>   The short squeeze was nearly a disaster for the hedge funds. u/rainforest11 explained, “Assuming the [share price] rocketed to $1,000 or beyond … hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag.”</p><p>   短暂的挤压几乎是对冲基金的灾难。 U / Rainforest11解释说：“假设[股价]飙升至1000美元或以上......对冲基金可能会破产，因为财务上讲，他们将无法涵盖所有​​短裤，并且可能是借出短边的实体对冲基金的股票是短暂的持有包。“</p><p>  But although GME’s momentum was at an apex on January 28, with the stock jumping to $513 a share in pre-trading, Robinhood suddenly shut off the ability to buy GME. Several other brokers followed. Immediately after this block on buys, FTDs and short interest dropped massively. The price also nosedived, which is what the naked shorters wanted.</p><p>  但虽然GME的势头于1月28日在一个顶点，但股票汇率涨至513美元的股票在前交易中，罗宾科突然关闭了购买GME的能力。接下来的其他几位经纪人。在该块之后立即购买，FTD和短兴趣幅度大幅下降。价格也迅速，这是裸体较短的想要的。</p><p>  u/broccaaa wanted to prove the manipulation, how naked short sellers can acquire shares and close the FTDs. He designed an algorithm to detect a type of option known as a “deep in the money (ITM) call,” which allows buyers to purchase shares significantly below the market price.</p><p>  U / Broccaaa希望证明操纵，赤裸的短卖家如何获得股票并关闭FTD。他设计了一种算法，可以检测称为“在货币（ITM）呼叫的深度”的选项类型，这使得买家可以大幅低于市场价格购买股票。</p><p>  “As FTDs were spiking and the situation became more and more unsustainable for the shorts towards the end of January, illegal Deep ITM options purchasing was used to naked short and cover FTDs,” he said. The chart below, compiled from historical options data, shows that on January 27, 25 million shares were acquired in this fashion. Overall, this technique conjured up to 150 million naked short shares. The blue line on the chart tracks fails to deliver as a percentage of float. These nearly disappear after January 27.</p><p>  “随着FTDS飙升，局势变得越来越不可持续到1月底的短裤，非法深度ITM选项购买用于赤裸而赤裸裸，覆盖FTD，”他说。下面的图表从历史期权数据编制，显示在1月27日，以这种方式获得了2500万股。总的来说，这种技术最多可达150万裸股份。图表轨道上的蓝线未能作为浮点数的百分比传递。这些几乎消失在1月27日之后。</p><p>     A  married put is a legal options trading strategy where an investor in a stock buys a put (an option to sell) on the same stock, to protect against depreciation in the stock’s price. Crooked hedge funds will simultaneously purchase puts from a market maker and buy shares of an equal number. In this way, the hedge fund obtains “phantom” shares from the market maker, which can be used to cover old positions or to sell on the market to suppress the price.</p><p>     已婚的是一项法律选项交易策略，股票中的投资者在同一股票上购买（一个卖出的选项），以防止股票价格贬值。弯曲的对冲基金将同时购买从市场制造商购买并购买相同数量的股票。通过这种方式，对冲基金从市场制造商那里获得“幻影”股票，可用于覆盖旧职位或在市场上销售以压制价格。 </p><p>  The SEC in 2003  expressed concern that “[s]ome strategies may involve the manipulative sale of securities underlying a married put as part of a scheme to drive the market price down and later profit by purchasing the securities at a depressed price.” It called them “sham transactions” which might violate the SEC’s anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions.</p><p>2003年的第二章表示关切的是，“[S] OME策略可能涉及一个已婚的证券的操纵销售，作为一项计划的一部分，以便以抑郁的价格购买证券以后的利润。”它呼吁他们“假交易”，可能违反秒的反欺诈和反操纵条款。</p><p>  This appears to have been at work in GME, according to the Superstonk users. A 13F form must be filed quarterly with the SEC by institutional investors with at least $100 million in shares. These filings for the biggest known GME short sellers showed a tremendous amount of puts. New put option contracts after the end of January represented more than 300 percent of shares outstanding, more than 200 million shares. “Melvin Capital, which lost 50 percent of its value, had 6 million shares in puts,” said u/broccaaa. This massive spike suggests that short positions have been hidden using “phantom shares” and “strategic fail-to-delivers.”</p><p>  根据Superstonk用户的说法，这似乎是GME的工作。 13F形式必须通过机构投资者季度向股票提交，至少有1亿美元的股票。这些最大的已知GME短卖家的申请表现出巨大的投入。新的投入选项合约在1月底之后代表超过300％的股份所得股，超过2亿股。 “Melvin Capital占其价值的50％，占据了600万股，”U / Broccaaa说。这种大规模的尖峰表明，使用“幻影股份”和“战略性未能提供”的短头已隐藏。</p><p>   As u/broccaaa says, “This spike coincides perfectly with the drop in reported short interest and FTDs.” He sees it as “the most damning evidence of massive manipulation.”</p><p>   随着U / Broccaaa的说法，“这件刺激与报告的短暂兴趣和FTDS的下降完全一致。”他认为它是“大规模操纵的最暗示的证据”。</p><p>  The options scam can also reset the clock on fails to deliver. Remember that short sellers have two days to locate a stock to prevent an FTD; market makers and other authorized participants may have up to six days. The SEC  explained a trading strategy known as “buy-write” in a 2013 paper. As  Investopedia explains, “A buy-write is an options trading strategy where an investor buys a security, usually a stock, with options available on it and simultaneously writes (sells) a call option on that security.” This recycling of positions shows as a new transaction, so the short sale timer is reset. And the trader may never deliver the shares, because he can roll over the trades and do the deal over and over.</p><p>  选项骗局还可以重置时钟无法提供。请记住，短暂的卖家有两天才能找到股票以防止FTD;市场制造商和其他授权参与者可能有长达六天。证券解释了在2013纸中称为“买写”的交易策略。随着Investopedia解释说，“买字是一个选项交易策略，投资者通常会购买安全性，通常是库存，并在其上提供备份，并同时写入（销售）该安全的呼叫选项。”这种位置的回收显示为新的交易，因此短销售计时器被重置。交易者可能永远不会交付股票，因为他可以通过交易滚动并一遍又一遍地进行交易。</p><p>  GME short positions could also be hidden in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a basket of stocks similar to a mutual fund. u/broccaaa’s research shows that fails to deliver migrated from GME to ETFs in January 2021. The total value of reported short interest (GME + ETFs) remained as high as ever, at over $27 billion owed.</p><p>  GME短头寸也可以隐藏在交易所交易资金（ETF）中，这是一款类似于共同基金的股票。 U / Broccaaa的研究表明，未来2021年1月未能从GME向ETF迁移到ETF。报告的短暂利息（GME + ETF）的总价值仍然高达270亿美元。</p><p>    In spite of knowing how fails to deliver represent sham trades, the SEC has facilitated big brokers and hedge funds continuing the con, using a system where FTDs go to die: dark pools, which began in the 1980s and now handle more than 40 percent of trades.</p><p>    尽管知道如何运送代表假交易，但秒有助于使用FTDS去死的系统，促进了大型经纪人和对冲基金，其中包括FTDS的系统：黑暗的游泳池，该游泳池始于20世纪80年代，现在处理超过40％的人交易。</p><p>  Dark pools are opaque private exchanges run by the major banks and prime dealers, and they are inaccessible to other investors. They were created to settle large trades by hedge funds and institutional investors without moving the markets.</p><p>  黑暗游泳池是由主要银行和主要经销商经营的不透明私人交易所，其他投资者无法访问。他们被创建，以解决对冲基金和机构投资者的大型交易，而不会移动市场。 </p><p>  As the SEC said in 2015: “The close-out requirement applies only to fail to deliver positions in an equity security at a  registered clearing agency.” So unsettled trades could migrate to dark pools, out of the sunlight where investors can’t see what is going on, and never be closed out. It is called “ex-clearing,” off exchange. It is naked shorters’ “get out of jail free” card.</p><p>正如美国委员会在2015年所述：“特写率要求仅适用于未能在注册清算机构的股权安全中提供职位。”如此沉迷的交易可能会迁移到黑暗的游泳池，从阳光下出来，投资者看不到发生的事情，而且永远不会被关闭。它被称为“优化，”off交换。它是赤身缩短的'“离开监狱”卡。</p><p>  The SEC has described transactions outside the clearing agencies as “rare.” Forty percent of all transactions is nowhere near rare!</p><p>  证券交易所描述了清算机构之外的交易，为“罕见”。所有交易中的四十个百分之无所作为罕见！</p><p>  Market makers like Citadel Securities facilitate dark pool transactions, without the market being aware of the transaction price. That prevents the transaction from impacting the share price on the public exchanges. In this fashion, GameStop manipulators could buy in a dark pool and sell on an open exchange, making money on the transaction.</p><p>  堡垒证券这样的市场制造商促进了黑暗游泳池的交易，而无需市场即可了解交易价格。这可以防止交易影响公交部门的股价。在这种方式，GameStop操纵器可以在黑暗的游泳池中购买并在开放的交换中销售，赚钱。</p><p>  Citadel’s hedge fund division has a history of being caught manipulating markets. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) said Citadel Securities “erroneously sold short, on a proprietary basis, 2.75 million shares of an entity causing the share price of the entity to fall by 77 percent during an eleven-minute period. In another instance, according to the NYSE, Citadel’s trading resulted in “an immediate increase in the price of the security of 132 percent.”</p><p>  Citadel的对冲基金部门具有追捕操纵市场的历史。纽约证券交易所（纽约证券交易所）表示，城堡证券“错误地卖空，专有卖空，275万股实体，导致实体的股价在十一分钟期间下降77％。在另一个例子中，根据纽约证券交易所的说法，Citadel的交易导致“立即增加了132％的价格。”</p><p>  And NYSE president Stacey Cunningham  said last week that so-called “meme stocks” like GME are prime targets for this manipulation. “The vast majority of order flow can trade off of exchanges, which is problematic,” Cunningham said at a CNBC conference. “That price formation is not really reflective of what supply and demand is.”</p><p>  纽约州总统斯蒂奇·苏宁安上周表示，所谓的“MEME股”就像GME一样是这种操纵的主要目标。 “绝大多数秩序流程可以缩小交易所，这是有问题的，”Cunningham在CNBC会议上表示。 “价格形成并不是反映的，供需是什么。”</p><p>  u/broccaaa compared his historical options data, which showed patterns consistent with naked shorting tricks, with dark pool trading volumes by known short funds. FINRA data since November 2020 showed GME activity ramped up massively at the start of January. Data shows that 25 percent of the GME float is traded OTC (over the counter in a dark pool), compared to less than 1 percent for major stocks.</p><p>  U / Broccaaa与他的历史选择数据相比，这表明与裸露的短路技巧一致，暗池交易量通过已知的短期资金。自11月2020年11月以来的Finra数据显示，GME活动在1月初迅速升起。数据显示，25％的GME浮法是交易OTC（在黑暗池中的柜台上），而主要股票的少于1％。</p><p>   Note the spike in GME dark pool trades at the end of J</p><p>   注意GME黑暗池在J的GME黑色池交易中的飙升 </p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://prospect.org/power/how-the-gamestop-hustle-worked/">https://prospect.org/power/how-the-gamestop-hustle-worked/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/gamestop/">#gamestop</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/hustle/">#hustle</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/股票/">#股票</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
