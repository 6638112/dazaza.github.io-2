", "note_en": "Last year, as an occasional contributor to the Rust project, I did not thinkmuch about the organisational structure of the team behind the project. I saw ahierarchy of teams and groups, team leaders, etc. Just like any otherorganisation. This year, after getting more involved, becoming a library teammember and eventually team lead, I spent some more time thinking about  why wehave this structure, what these teams are for.\n  In most companies, there are directors and shareholders and whatnot at the topof the hierarchy, who set goals for the company. Targets, milestones, deadlines,things that will hopefully drive the company towards whatever the ultimate goalis; usually money.\n Then there are several layers of management split over departments and teams todivide up the workload. Each taking care of part of the targets, making surethat their part gets done, eventually assigning tasks to the employees at thebottom of the hierarchy, all working towards the main goal in some way oranother.\n While the structure behind a big open source project like Rust can look similarfrom a distance, it\u2019s often completely inverted.In such a project, the targets and goals are not those of the top level team(s),but effectively those of the contributors.\n For example, as the library team we could try to decide that the formatmachinery (std::fmt) should be rewritten to be smaller and more efficient. Butmaking that decision doesn\u2019t make it happen. And we don\u2019t have employees weassign things to. That\u2019s not how this works.\n Instead, a contributor with a passion for formatting algorithms might show up,and starts working on these things. Our job as the library team is to empowerthis person. Make sure their plan is in line with the rest of the standardlibrary, review their changes and provide useful constructive feedback,if more people show up to work on this, set up a working group to help themorganize it all, etc. etc.\n Companies don\u2019t get new people randomly showing up to work on something. That\u2019swhat makes open source special and such a wonderful place, if done right.\n  Ideally, the project goals of an open source project like Rust are simply thecombination of personal goals of everyone working on it. And this is tricky.Because when a new person shows up, we don\u2019t assign them a task that fits withour goals. Instead, this person comes with their own goals and ideas, adding toan already quite diverse set of potentially conflicting goals.\n And this is why an open source project run by volunteers needs a managementstructure. You can\u2019t just put together a hundred people with each their owngoals, and hope it all works out.\n So what the management does, is take all the personal goals from everyoneworking on a certain topic, and try to guide them in a way that things will workout. That might involve saying no to ideas when they would not fit with otherideas, or it might involve lots of discussion to align ideas to make them fit.This is exactly opposite of how it works in a typical company, where the goalscome from above, and the management decides how to split it up and assign it tothe people doing the technical work.\n While many open source projects, including Rust, do have an overal direction orroadmap, these have to be based on the goals of the individual contributors inorder to succeed. Saying \u201cour main goal in 2021 is to improve the formattingmachinery in the standard library\u201d would empower those already working on it,and attract those that already wanted to work on something like that. It wouldhelp them because we\u2019d now prioritize any management decisions and code reviewsthey need. It\u2019d allow people to focus, and get more done. But without thosecontributors, setting such a goal is meaningless. Unlike a company, we don\u2019t getto choose what people spend their time on, and we don\u2019t hire people to assigntasks to.\n   I\u2019m not saying a programming language couldn\u2019t be managed \u2018from the top\u2019 like acompany would. Many programming languages have been and are being developed thatway very effectively. What I am saying, however, is that I personally don\u2019t wantthe Rust project to work that way.\n I do  not want to manage the library department of the Rust company.I want to empower the people who want to improve the libraries of the Rustlanguage.\n  Different contributors have wildly different goals, work in very different ways,and need completely different things from the management structure.\n For some of them, we have processes in place to make their job easier. Someonewho wants to work on a new language feature can submit their ideas as an RFC andjoin a discussion with the library team for advice and guidance.Someone who wants to improve some big part of the compiler implementation cansubmit a MCP (major change proposal) and discuss it with the compiler team.And someone who wants to fix a bug in the standard library, can submit a PR andget it reviewed by someone who knows the context.\n In other words, we have made space for these kind of contributors. Space to dotheir work, space to get feedback, space to get help, space to get recognition,whatever space they need to succeed.\n However, there are unfortunately many kinds of contributors for which we havenot made space, or not the right space.\n Until recently, the library team was mostly focussed on API design. Criticalimplementation issues were handled by the compiler team out of necessity.Smaller implementation changes were reviewed by individual library reviewers.But there was no management of larger implementation changes.This meant that there was no space for someone who would\u2019ve wanted to overhaulthe std::fmt implementation. There was no team they could go to or be part of towork on this, making it a lot harder, or outright impossible, to achieve theirgoals.\n  Making space for something can often lead to (accidentally) taking away spacefrom something else.Someone who is not involved much in the implementation of things, but wants toapply their experience in API design and cares deeply about the standardlibrary\u2019s interface, would not thrive in a team that likes to have weeklymeetings talking about implementation soundness bugs and how to work around thembefore the next release.\n  We also now have the Library Contributors. A place for those who are moreinvolved in the project than the occasional contributor, but who are not part ofthe teams making the overall decisions. This makes space for those who want to,for example, work on only a specific part of the library, or help out withreviewing proposed changes. Until about a year ago, there was no space forsomeone to review library changes or get more involved in other ways, withoutdirectly being part of a team with many more responsibilities.\n I was able to make these team structure changes with help from the core team andthe library team members, who empowered me to do this. In turn, these changeshopefully empower members of these new teams to thrive, and in their turnempower many more contributors, eventually benefiting all users of thelanguage.\n  I don\u2019t have the impression that we\u2019ve now successfully created space for everypossible contributor. But once the dust of the reorganisation settles, I dothink the result will be an improvement over what we had before, and fits betterwith the project as it is right now.\n \u201cRight now\u201d being the important part there. These teams are designed around thecurrent members and the people who I think might become a member in the nearfuture. But this group of people and their needs changes, sometimes surprisinglyfast. And in a project that\u2019s entirely defined by the people contributing to it,that changes the project itself and the structure that it needs, just asquickly.\n In 2018, the Libraries Team was much involved in guiding authors of popularcrates in the ecosystem. The team published a set of guidelines, and wouldreview crates and work together with crate authors to implement them. All ofthis to improve consistency and the quality of the Rust crate ecosystem.\n Until a few days ago, this was still technically part of our team\u2019s explicitgoals, even though not much of this was happening anymore; especially sinceAshley Mannix left a while back. Without people who have it as their  personalgoal to make something happen, things just don\u2019t happen.\n  There\u2019s many things on everyone\u2019s Rust wish list that are just not happeningbecause nobody is working on it. We\u2019re not a company with deadlines andmilestones we need to reach. We\u2019re a diverse and quickly changing group ofpeople passionately making the things happen that we want to put effort in.Including a bunch of people passionately trying to manage it all, trying to makespace for all these efforts to happen in harmony.\n There are many things for which we should have space, but currently don\u2019t havespace for. But if we keep trying. If we keep making small improvements. Keepadapting. Keep looking out for those around us want to contribute too; how wecan empower them, and each other. Then every step will be one in the rightdirection, making Rust and all of the many people who work on it, and with it, thrive.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 00:50:40", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "rust,\u94c1\u9508,\u56e2\u961f", "title": "\u94c1\u9508\u4e0d\u662f\u516c\u53f8 ", "title_en": "Rust Is Not a Company", "transed": 1, "url": "https://blog.m-ou.se/rust-is-not-a-company/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["rust", "\u94c1\u9508", "\u56e2\u961f"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "fdc8176072e1166957a700325e3feb2a.jpg", "infoid": 1066730, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7ebd\u7ea6\uff08CNN Business\uff09\u534e\u5c14\u8857\u4e00\u8857\u4e4b\u4e00\u7684\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\uff06\uff0339;\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u7684\u9876\u7ea7\u6295\u8d44\u94f6\u884c\u5728\u7ebd\u7ea6\u529e\u4e8b\u5904\u4e3e\u529e\u5458\u5de5\u3002\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u56de\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\n Morgan Stanley\uff08MS\uff09\u9996\u5e2d\u8a79\u59c6\u65af\u00b7\u6208\u5c14\u66fc\u672c\u5468\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u5728\u6295\u8d44\u5927\u4f1a\u4e0a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\uff06\uff0339;\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5de5\u4eba\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5de5\u4eba\u73b0\u5728\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u4eba\u5728Covid-19\u63a5\u79cd\u75ab\u82d7\u800c\u4e14\u751f\u6d3b\u6162\u6162\u6062\u590d\u6b63\u5e38\u3002\n \uff06\uff0334;\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u53bb\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5e02\u7684\u4e00\u5bb6\u9910\u9986\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u5165\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u60a8\u5728\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u6208\u5c14\u66fc\u8bf4\u3002\n     Gorman\u4e8e\u5468\u4e00\u53d1\u8868\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u91d1\u878d\u652f\u4ed8\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u7684\u5e74\u5ea6\u4f1a\u8bae\u3002\u4ed6\u5f00\u73a9\u7b11\u8bf4\u4ed6\u4ece\u516c\u53f8\u90a3\u91cc\u505a\u5230\u4e86\uff0c\u7ebd\u7ea6\u529e\u516c\u5ba4 - \u4ee5\u53ca\u7a7f\u7740\u897f\u88c5\u548c\u9886\u5e26\u9774\u5b50\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u3002\n    \u6208\u5c14\u66fc\u8bf4\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u6469\u6839\u58eb\u4e39\u5229\u5458\u5de5\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f00\u59cb\u6162\u6162\u5730\u56de\u5230\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u603b\u90e8\uff0c\u6bcf\u5468\u51e0\u5929\u90fd\u5728\u5e7f\u573a\u76841585\u767e\u4e07\u767e\u4e07\u3002\n  \u4f46Gorman\u8bf4\uff0c\u590f\u5929\u7ed3\u675f\u4e86\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5de5\u4eba\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u7f29\u653e\u5e76\u66f4\u52a0\u5b9a\u671f\u5730\u8fdb\u5165\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u3002\n \uff06\uff0334;\u5728\u52b3\u52a8\u8282\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4eba\u4eec\u6ca1\u6709\u627e\u5230\u8fdb\u5165\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u6211\u4eec\u4f1a\u975e\u5e38\u5931\u671b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u7136\u540e\u6211\u4eec\uff06\uff0339;

", "note_en": "New York (CNN Business)The CEO of one of Wall Street&#39;s top investment banks has a message for employees in its New York offices. You need to come back to work this fall.\n Morgan Stanley  (  MS) chief James Gorman said at an  investing conference earlier this week that it&#39;s time for the bank&#39;s New York workers to head back to the office now that more people are getting vaccinated for Covid-19 and life is slowly returning to normal.\n &#34;If you can go to a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office. And we want you in the office,&#34; Gorman said.\n     Gorman made the comments Monday at an annual conference about financial payments and commercial real estate. He joked that he was doing so from the company&#39;s New York office \u2014 and while wearing a suit and tie to boot.\n    Gorman said that many Morgan Stanley employees have already started to slowly make their way back to the firm&#39;s headquarters at 1585 Broadway in Times Square a couple of days a week.\n  But Gorman said that once the summer is over, most of the New York workers will need to be getting off Zoom and taking the subway into the office more regularly.\n &#34;By Labor Day, I&#39;ll be very disappointed if people haven&#39;t found their way into the office and then we&#39;ll have a different kind of conversation,&#34; he said, adding that workers can&#39;t expect to get their New York salaries if they continue to work remotely.\n &#34;If you want to get paid New York rates, you work in New York,&#34; Gorman said. &#34;None of this &#39;I&#39;m in Colorado...and getting paid like I&#39;m sitting in New York City.&#39; Sorry. That doesn&#39;t work.&#34;\n  Gorman was quick to note that the company would still be flexible with regards to splitting time between at home and the office. He said the policy would not be &#34;dictatorial,&#34; noting that many working parents still need to be home with kids if they&#39;re not in school or camp.\n On Thursday, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan echoed Gorman&#39;s sentiment, saying that  he expects vaccinated employees to return to the office after Labor Day. &#34;We&#39;ll be able to operate fairly normally and will then start to make provisions for the other teammates as we move through the fall,&#34; Moynihan said.\n  Gorman also noted that he hopes that most Morgan Stanley workers coming back to the office would be vaccinated, saying that &#34;well over 90%&#34; of employees already had received Covid-19 shots and that he expected that number to eventually reach 98% to 99%.\n But Gorman conceded that some employees may not get vaccinated for health or religious reasons and that the company will deal with that.\n Gorman was also quick to note that the company&#39;s policy for returning to the office would be looked at on a case-by-case business. The company has offices around the globe and also recently bought online brokerage E-Trade and investment management firm Eaton Vance.\n  Morgan Stanley has 10,000 employees in India, which has been hit particularly hard by Covid-19 recently.\n    &#34;I don&#39;t think making a blanket statement to all employees is helpful,&#34; he added. &#34;I don&#39;t think speaking to employees who work at 1585 Broadway in Times Square is the same as speaking to a small office in Topeka.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-19 00:49:58", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u9996\u5e2d,stanley,\u7ebd\u7ea6", "title": "\u6469\u6839\u58eb\u4e39\u5229\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5de5\u4eba\uff1a9\u6708\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u56de\u5230\u529e\u516c\u5ba4 ", "title_en": "Morgan Stanley CEO to NYC workers: Be back in the office by September or else", "transed": 1, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/16/investing/morgan-stanley-ceo-return-to-office/index.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9996\u5e2d", "stanley", "\u7ebd\u7ea6"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "0a67d6ac1af4a59d5a6d9d973e4bc9c9.jpg", "infoid": 1066729, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4f60\u77e5\u9053\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bf9\u91cd\u5851\u8f6e\u5b50\u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\uff06\uff0339\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u597d\u4e3b\u610f\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u7279\u65af\u62c9\u900f\u9732\u51fa\u5237\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u4e5f\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u611a\u8822\u7684\u8f6d\u5f0f\u65b9\u5411\u76d8\uff0c\uff06\uff0339;

When Tesla revealed the refreshed Model S, though, it also brought with it a  goofy yoke-style steering wheel that&#39;s become pretty controversial amongst Tesla stans and the general car-driving public.\n Debates on whether on not the wheel is tasteful have run rampant on social media, many defending the use of a non-traditional steering wheel because it allows for more unobstructed visibility of the gauge cluster. Others argue that the real issue is practicality\u2014and as videos of the refreshed Model S begin to hit the internet, that&#39;s becoming pretty evident. As shocking as it may be, it turns out that a rectangle might not be the most ideal shape for a steering wheel on a daily-driven car.\n   The refreshed Tesla Model S has a lot going for it, especially if you&#39;re driving it in a straight line. The Plaid variant will do  zero to 60 miles per hour in under two seconds\u2014so long as you  VHT-prep the track surface, allow the car several minutes to pre-condition the battery and powertrain, and then  drop it into its &#34;Cheetah&#34; stance. The new yoke steering wheel is an interesting addition to the cabin too, and it is better for forward visibility. The only real challenge comes if you need to turn, which is also pretty important.\n Several videos have popped up online of new owners in their Model S Plaids. There&#39;s a big focus on what they&#39;ll spend the most time interacting with ( hopefully): the steering wheel.\n As expected, there seems to be a learning curve when it comes to the yoke. There&#39;s a lot more hand-over-hand steering, and a significant amount of additional steps required to move the grippable base of the wheel to the next hand.\n  While not pretty, this is probably something a driver will get used to after they own the car for a few weeks. However, that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;ll be safer in an emergency situation.\n If a driver would lose control of their vehicle after hitting ice, for example, their body is going to go into response mode. Quick-thinking might revert back to old habits of driving a normal car where there&#39;s a completely round steering wheel, whereas with the yoke, there&#39;s significantly less to grab onto.\n This isn&#39;t the only example of the yoke looking unnatural to use. A few videos have popped up showing refreshed Model S&#39;s (esses?) driving around town, navigating parking lots, and just really putting the chopped wheel to use\u2014and none of them look to be particularly intuitive.\n   As you can see in the  clip above, the driver has to move hand-over-hand\u2014which is fine and still recommended by the  NHTSA\u2014to navigate at low-speeds. But he brings his left arm from 9 o&#39;clock and uses it to turn the yoke about 270 degrees before letting go, presumably to bring more grippable area for his right hand.\n Try repeating that exact same motion and you&#39;ll probably start to feel a bit of a stretch around the 4 o&#39;clock mark. It probably won&#39;t feel great to do that regularly.\n Tesla could have solved this problem by implementing a dynamic steering ratio, which allows the wheels to turn a varying amount based on how fast a vehicle is traveling at any given time. Audi, BMW, Ford, Volvo, and many other automakers have implemented this particular feature across their respective lineups for years. In parking lots, this translates to shorter rotations of the steering wheel.\n Musk says that Tesla is working on this, but it&#39;s still &#34;a few years&#34; away.\n   I know what you&#39;re going to say next: &#34;Yoke wheels are really meant for racing anyway.&#34;\n Maybe you&#39;re right. Maybe the Model S should be  taken back to Laguna Seca to throw down a few laps and make use of that new racecar-inspired steering wheel.\n Well, that actually happened, and the track verdict pretty much lines up with what we see on the street. While racing around Laguna Seca, veteran driver Randy Pobst  apparently asked for the yoke to be swapped out for a regular steering wheel after just three laps.\n   The whole ordeal\u2014especially with Musk&#39;s adamant public defense\u2014feels eerily similar to the Model S&#39;s pop-out door handles.   Wired reported in 2018 that the pop-out door handles, while unanimously rejected amongst other executives at Tesla, were a requirement for Musk. Just two months after publishing, a Florida man in a Model S  wrecked into a tree and burned to death when firefighters were allegedly unable to open the door. A  lawsuit was filed later that year and is scheduled for trial in mid-2022.\n It seems like the refreshed Model S can&#39;t actually be ordered without the yoke yet, despite  prior website code indicating a potential option to choose between it and a regular wheel. So if you really want to replace your aging vehicle with a new high-performance, battery-electric luxury sedan, maybe take it for a test drive first to make sure you can live with the yoke.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 00:49:29", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7279\u65af\u62c9,rider,knight,\u6a21\u578b", "title": "\u7279\u65af\u62c9\u7684'Knight Rider'\u8f6c\u5411\u8f6d\u662f\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba\u4e2d\u88ab\u6dd8\u6c70 ", "title_en": "Tesla\u2019s \u2018Knight Rider\u2019 Steering Yoke Is Getting Panned in Early Reviews", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.thedrive.com/news/41161/teslas-knight-rider-steering-yoke-is-getting-panned-in-early-reviews", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7279\u65af\u62c9", "rider", "knight", "\u6a21\u578b"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "3df4874cf31ed3b660fa5b136deb0af8.jpg", "infoid": 1066727, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4e00\u9879\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5730\u7403\u571f\u5730\uff0c\u6d77\u6d0b\u548c\u5927\u6c14\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u70ed\u91cf\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u70ed\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u4e00\u500d\u3002\n \u4e3a\u4e86\u5f04\u6e05\u695a\u5730\u7403\u9677\u5165\u591a\u5c11\u70ed\u91cf\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u770b\u7740\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b87\u822a\u5c40\u536b\u661f\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e86\u9633\u5149\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u8fdb\u5165\u5730\u7403\u5927\u6c14\u7684\u5927\u5927\u6c1b\u56f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u91cd\u65b0\u56de\u843d\u5230\u592a\u7a7a\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c06\u5176\u4e0eNoAa\u6d6e\u6807\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e86\u6d77\u6d0b\u6e29\u5ea6 -

They compared this with data from NOAA buoys that tracked ocean temperatures \u2014 which gives them an idea of how much heat is getting absorbed into the ocean.\n The difference between the amount of heat absorbed by Earth, and the amount reflected back into space is called an energy imbalance. In this case, they found that from 2005 to 2019, the amount of heat absorbed by Earth was going up. Their results  were published in Geophysical Research Letters this week.\n \u201cThe two very independent ways of looking at changes in Earth\u2019s energy imbalance are in really, really good agreement, and they\u2019re both showing this very large trend, which gives us a lot of confidence that what we\u2019re seeing is a real phenomenon and not just an instrumental artifact,\u201d said Norman Loeb, a NASA researcher and the lead author for the study  in a press release. \u201cThe trends we found were quite alarming in a sense.\u201d\n   The researchers think that the reason the Earth is holding on to more heat comes down to a few different factors. One is human-caused climate change. Among other problems, the more greenhouse gases we emit, the more heat they trap. It gets worse when you take into account that increasing heat also melts ice and snow. Ice and snow can help the planet reflect heat back into space \u2014 as they disappear, more heat can be absorbed by the land and oceans underneath.\n There\u2019s another factor at play too \u2014 natural changes to a climate pattern called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Between 2014 and 2019, the pattern was in a \u2018warm phase\u2019 which caused fewer clouds to form. That  also meant more heat could be absorbed by the oceans.\n More than likely, it\u2019s the combination of climate change with those natural shifts that made such a big difference to Earth\u2019s energy balance, Loeb says. \u201cAnd over this period they\u2019re both causing warming, which leads to a fairly large change in Earth\u2019s energy imbalance.

It&#39;s a term for what happens when a hacker slips malicious code into legitimate software that can spread far and wide. And as more supply chain attacks emerge, a new open source project is angling to take a stand, making a crucial safeguard free and easy to implement.\n The founders of  Sigstore hope that their platform will spur adoption of code signing, an important protection for software supply chains but one that popular and widely used open source software often overlooks. Open source developers don&#39;t always have the resources, time, expertise, or wherewithal to fully implement code signing on top of all the other nonnegotiable components they need to build for their code to function.\n \u201cUntil about a year and a half ago I felt like the crazy person standing on the corner with a sign that says, \u2018The End Is Coming.\u2019 Nobody understood the problem,\u201d says Dan Lorenc, an open source software supply chain researcher and engineer at Google. \u201cBut in the past year things have changed considerably. Now everybody is talking about supply chain security, we have an  Executive Order about it, and everybody is starting to realize how critical open source is and how we need to actually put some resources behind fixing the security of it for everybody.\u201d\n Lorenc is far from the only researcher who focused on the  challenges of securing open source projects or the supply chain. But the mainstream attention generated by recent high-profile hacks garnered a whole new level of enthusiasm for work Lorenc and his collaborators already had underway.\n  To understand Sigstore&#39;s significance you need to have a sense of what code signing does. Think of it like battle orders delivered in olden times. Generals would recognize the handwriting of the royal scribe, the commander in chief&#39;s signature, and the detailed wax seal on the envelope, while a carefully vetted network of pages delivered the messages in a controlled chain of custody. That system worked because it was extremely difficult\u2014though not totally impossible\u2014for an outside entity to infiltrate the process, replicate crucial elements, and get around all those integrity checks.\n  The same is true for cryptographic code signing. You can&#39;t just make up a Windows update and distribute it to your closest friends or enemies. Only Microsoft can do that unless something has gone very wrong. One reason it&#39;s so challenging for anyone other than Microsoft to send updates to your Windows laptop is that the software needs to have been \u201csigned\u201d by the right creator at the right time. It&#39;s the John Hancock and wax seal of the digital era.\n  You can see why the stakes are so high, though, for ancient battles and modern software alike. If someone  could send rogue orders or updates, they could stage a coup\u2014or compromise billions of computers. The benefits of code signing are clear, but getting hobbyists, volunteers, and other open source contributors to incorporate it requires a low barrier to entry.\n  \u201cThese are huge issues that put the entire world\u2019s infrastructure at risk,\u201d says Bob Callaway, a chief architect at the enterprise open source software company RedHat. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not a panacea that will fix everything, but it will make a big dent getting people to actually use best practices and cryptographic techniques that have been around for a long time and make releases more secure.\u201d\n Sigstore, which is  affiliated with the Linux Foundation and currently led by Google, Red Hat and Purdue University, combines two components. First, it coordinates convoluted cryptography for its users; it even gives the option to literally handle everything for developers who can&#39;t or don&#39;t want to take on the extra work themselves. By using established, preexisting identifiers like an email address, or a third-party sign-in system like Sign In With Google or Sign In With Facebook, you can quickly start cryptographically signing code you produce as having been made by you at a certain time. Second, Sigstore automatically produces a public, immutable open source log of all activity. That provides public accountability of every submission, and a place to start investigating if something goes awry.\n  \u201cAround 2019 I was talking with Luke Hinds at RedHat and I said wouldn\u2019t it be cool if we could have basically a paper trail of everything that happened in the software supply chain, some sort of transparency log,\u201d says Santiago Torres-Arias, a supply chain researcher at Purdue University. \u201cThen he disappeared for a couple of months. And then he came back with a prototype.\u201d\n On Friday, Lorenc, Torres-Arias, Callaway, Hinds, and secure software distribution researcher Marina Moore of New York University will all participate in a  public cryptographic ceremony to become the progenitor keyholders of Sigstore. They&#39;ll generate and load encryption keys, essentially passwords, onto secure thumb drives that will remain in their possession for four months. After that the keys will rotate in another ceremony to other holders\u2014a gesture toward the goal of making Sigstore a neutral community project. Any changes to the system will require the presence of three out of five keyholders. This establishes a \u201croot of trust\u201d for all of the development projects that will be able to adopt SigStore going forward.\n \u201cIt&#39;s definitely both scary and exciting,\u201d NYU&#39;s Moore says. \u201cThis is one of the five keys that\u2019s underpinning the security of the whole system. If all is well I&#39;ll just lock it in a safe for four months, but it&#39;s definitely something I&#39;ve been thinking about.\u201d\n Sigstore will need to be widely adopted to be successful. But with supply chain attacks looming as an increasingly mainstream concern, the five keyholders say they think that something easy and free really has the potential to take off. A similar project called Let&#39;s Encrypt issues free encryption certificates to websites, and has been a  huge driver in the global effort to  encrypt the vast majority of web traffic. To date it has issued certificates to more than 260 million websites.\n  One reason open source security is so complicated is that it&#39;s easy to grab code from various projects around the web and incorporate it into other software, both open and proprietary. This creates a supply chain nightmare, because some open source projects are widely used even though they aren&#39;t well-maintained or have even been abandoned altogether. Code signing certainly doesn&#39;t solve every problem, and supply chain hacks can still happen even when a developer signs their code. But given how sophisticated those attacks get, any project that doesn&#39;t incorporate basic protections like signing put themselves at real risk.\n  As for Friday&#39;s key ceremony, the event adds transparency to a process that is usually done behind closed doors at large companies or institutions. And while the first five keyholders will only bear the responsibility during the fledgling months of Sigstore&#39;s release, the role could someday take on even more gravity if the project provides the code signing foundation for numerous high profile projects.\n \u201cYou know, I have not really dwelled on whether we\u2019re going to be hunted down by James Bond-types,\u201d Red Hat&#39;s Hinds says of being a key holder. \u201cWho knows, let\u2019s see how big we become.&#34;\n   \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Want the best tools to get healthy?
