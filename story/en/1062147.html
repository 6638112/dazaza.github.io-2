But once we are well into adulthood, it may start to feel as if it’s all downhill from there. With every advancing year, we become slightly more forgetful, somewhat slower to respond, a little less energetic.</p><p>当我们年轻时，我们的技能随着年龄和经验而倾向于改善。但是一旦我们进入成年期，它可能会开始感觉好像这一切都从那里下坡。随着每一个推进年度，我们变得稍微忘了，有点慢，回应较慢，精力少一点。</p><p>    Yet there is at least one important exception: In the emotional realm, older people rule supreme.</p><p>    然而，至少有一个重要的例外：在情绪领域，老年人统治至高无上。</p><p>  For the past 20 years, Susan Turk Charles, a psychologist at the University of California, Irvine, has been monitoring the shifting moods, the sense of satisfaction, the moments of contemplation and the occasional outbursts of anger, sadness and despair of people of all ages — with a special interest in how we handle and experience emotions as we grow older. She and her colleagues have found that, on average, older people have fewer but more satisfying social contacts and report higher emotional well-being.</p><p>  在过去的20年里，加州大学的心理学家苏珊土库尔斯·查尔斯欧文，一直在监测转移的情绪，满意感，思考的时刻和偶尔的愤怒，悲伤和绝望的愤怒，悲伤和绝望的爆发年龄 - 由于我们年龄增长的方式，对我们如何处理和体验情感的特殊兴趣。她和她的同事发现，平均而言，老年人的社会联系人更少但更令人满意，并报告更高的情感福祉。</p><p>  What is the secret behind this grizzled levelheadedness? How can we make sure that as many people as possible can benefit from it? And what can it teach the young? In 2010, Charles and Stanford psychologist Laura Carstensen coauthored  an article on social and emotional aging in the  Annual Review of Psychology. We circled back to Charles to learn more about the phenomenon and how the research has unfolded. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p>  这个浮夸的普通头脑背后的秘密是什么？我们如何确保尽可能多的人可以从中受益？它能教什么呢？ 2010年，查尔斯和斯坦福心理学家劳拉卡斯滕森在心理学年度审查中定于社会和情感老龄化的一篇文章。我们圈回查尔斯来了解有关现象的更多信息以及研究如何展开。此对话已被编辑为长度和清晰度。</p><p>    When I was an undergraduate, in the early ’90s, I was really interested in development. At that time, the scientific literature was saying that our personality and emotions were fully developed by the time we are 18. I heard this and thought, “Wow, the next 50 years, nothing gets better? This is it?” Then I took a class from Laura Carstensen at Stanford, and she was the first person to say that there  was more development after age 18. She was finding that unlike physical fitness or cognition, where you may see slowing or declines, emotional regulation and experience are often as good, if not better, as we age. It was talking to her that got me excited about this field. I fell in love with the idea of studying a process related to aging that is not defined by a decline.</p><p>    当我在90年代初，我的本科生时，我真的很感兴趣的发展。那时，科学文学说，我们的个性和情绪是完全开发的我们18岁的时候。我听到了这个和思想，“未来50年，没有什么比这更好的了？就是这个？”然后我坐在斯坦福劳拉卡斯滕森上课，她是第一个说18岁后有更多发展的人。她发现与身体健康或认知不同，你可能会看到放缓或下降，情绪调节和经验往往好，如果不是更好，因为我们的年龄。它正在和她谈论，让我兴奋了这一领域。我爱上了研究与老龄化有关的过程的想法，这些过程并没有被拒绝定义。</p><p>    Some neuroscientists believe that because we’re processing information a little slower with age, that makes us think before we act, instead of reacting quickly. We do see a decline with age in overall mass of the brain’s frontal lobe, the part that is responsible for emotion regulation, complex reasoning and speed of processing. But researchers such as Mara Mather at the University of Southern California find that older adults often exhibit greater prefrontal cortex activity than younger adults when processing emotions.</p><p>    一些神经科学家认为，因为我们随着年龄的增长处理信息，使我们在行动之前思考，而不是快速反应。我们确实看到大脑额叶的总体大量的年龄下降，这是对情绪调节，复杂的推理和加工速度的部分。但是，南加州大学Mara Mather等研究人员发现，在加工情绪时，老年人的成年人往往比年轻成年人更大的前额叶皮质活动。</p><p>  A lot of work has found that older people have a positive bias, even without realizing they’re actually doing this. Their default mode is, as we say, “Don’t sweat the small stuff.” We find that older people more often let go of a situation they experience as negative, especially with friends and family. So it is really picking their battles that we think older adults are better at. If you look at older adults who have cognitive decline, they are not defaulting to the positive.</p><p>  很多工作都发现老年人有积极的偏见，即使没有意识到他们实际上这样做了。正如我们所说，他们的默认模式是“不要出汗小东西”。我们发现老年人更经常放弃他们经历消极的情况，特别是与朋友和家人一起经历。所以它真的挑选了他们认为老年人更好的战斗。如果您看看具有认知衰退的老年人，他们并不默认为积极。 </p><p>    It depends on what aspects you’re looking at, but the peak we see in terms of the highest positive and lowest negative emotions is between 55 and 70. Then there’s the measure of “life satisfaction,” which includes both happiness and sadness, as well as a cognitive evaluation of how your life is going. For that, we often see a little lower ratings in midlife, lowest among people who are in their early 50s, and then it goes up. So again, it’s higher with older age. Only after 75 do negative emotions start increasing again.</p><p>这取决于您正在研究的各个方面，但我们在最高的积极和最低负面情绪方面看到的山峰在55到70之间。然后有“生活满意度”的衡量标准，包括幸福和悲伤，如以及对你的生活如何运作的认知评估。为此，我们经常看到中年的评分有点较低，在50年代初期的人中最低，然后它上升。所以再次，它与年龄较高。只有在75后，消极情绪再次开始增加。</p><p>      Susan Turk Charles speaks at this May 6, 2021 online event hosted by  Knowable Magazine.</p><p>      Susan Turk Charles在今年6月6日发言，由知名杂志托管的2021年5月6日。</p><p>      Yet even centenarians, you write in your review, report overall high levels of emotional well-being. I imagine that by this point, some people may start wondering whether it might just be that people who have more positive attitudes, or encounter less adversity, live longer.</p><p>      甚至是百岁老人，您在您的评论中写下，报告了整体高水平的情感福祉。我想象一下，有些人可能会想知道它是否可能只是那些有更积极的态度的人，或者遇到更少的逆境，生活更长时间。</p><p>  It is true that people with  satisfying relationships and  positive emotions live longer. Researchers have looked at what could explain this, and they find that psychological well-being is consistently related to lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol and better cardiovascular health. Other researchers have modeled that, and they still see an age-related advantage.</p><p>  确实，满足关系和积极情绪的人更长时间。研究人员已经看了可以解释这一点，他们发现心理幸福是始终如一地与压力激素皮质醇和更好的心血管健康有关。其他研究人员已经建模，他们仍然看到了与年龄相关的优势。</p><p>  So emotion regulation improves with age; we see this again and again. These are small effects, but they are consistent. We see improvement for the majority of people, but not for everyone. I don’t know the percentages, but let’s say you have 40 percent remaining stable, 40 percent going up and 20 percent going down, you’ll see people still going up on average.</p><p>  因此，情绪调节随着年龄的增长而改善;我们一次又一次地看到了这一点。这些都是小的效果，但它们是一致的。我们看到大多数人的改善，但不是每个人。我不知道百分比，但让我们说你有40％的稳定，40％上涨和20％的下降，你会看到人们平均仍然上涨。</p><p>    Most of the people who have been included in these studies are what researchers define as WEIRD — people from Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic societies. We also know that not only are they from WEIRD societies, they often represent people from the dominant, white culture. This demographic profile means that a lot of people had financial security, they had pensions, there were social systems in place, and often the people we would interview were middle-class white people who were employed, who had a higher level of education. Compared to younger people of comparable socioeconomic status, the older people looked a lot better. But if older people are in very vulnerable situations, without stable housing, faced with constant stressors, or if they are living in pain, you may not see these benefits.</p><p>    已经包含在这些研究中的大多数人都是研究人员定义了西方，受过教育，工业化，丰富和民主社会的奇怪。我们也知道，它们不仅是奇怪的社会，他们通常代表来自主导，白文的人。这种人口概况意味着很多人都有财务安全，他们有养老金，有社会制度，我们将采访的人往往是被雇用的中产阶级白人，他有更高水平的教育。与可比社会经济地位的年轻人相比，老年人看起来更好。但是，如果老年人处于非常脆弱的情况下，如果没有稳定的住房，面对恒定的压力源，或者如果他们生活在疼痛中，你可能看不到这些福利。</p><p>  Stable housing is a common concern for young people too. Are these the kinds of things that weigh on their minds?</p><p>  稳定的住房也是年轻人的共同关心。这些是他们思想的各种东西吗？ </p><p>  I think what’s really important for emotional well-being is to know that your future is secure, to achieve the luxury of not worrying about your future. When you’re younger, there’s a lot to worry about. I sometimes tell my undergrads: When older people say, “This is the best time of your life, enjoy it while you can,” that’s a form of abuse. A lot of younger people have high rates of distress.</p><p>我认为对情感幸福感觉非常重要是要知道你的未来是安全的，以实现不担心你的未来的奢侈品。当你年轻的时候，有很多令人担忧的。我有时会告诉我的本科：当老年人说：“这是你生命中最美好的时光，在你可以的时候享受它，”这是一种虐待形式。很多年轻人都有很高的痛苦率。</p><p>  My former mentor Laura Carstensen’s “socioemotional selectivity theory” talks about how everyone has a sense of how much time we have left in our lives. Younger people who are healthy and expect to have a long life ahead of them put in the hard work, and they value gathering information and planning for the future. As you get older, you see that there is less and less time left, and people start valuing emotional goals more. Older people will also rather spend time with family and friends than meet brand new people who might be interesting.</p><p>  我的前导师劳拉卡​​斯滕森的“社会情调选择性理论”谈到每个人的人们有多么留在我们的生活中。年轻人健康，期待在他们努力工作之前拥有寿命长，他们重视信息和将来的规划。随着年龄的增长，你会看到剩下的时间越来越少，人们更开始更多地重视情绪目标。老年人也宁愿与家人和朋友共度时光，而不是满足可能有趣的全新人。</p><p>  A recent study in  Science found that like humans,  older chimpanzees tend to have fewer but more positive social interactions, and so the researchers conclude that this development does not necessarily depend on the realization that time is running out. Do you agree that the mechanism behind these changes may be more basic than we thought?</p><p>  最近的科学研究发现，像人类一样，旧的黑猩猩往往有更少但更积极的社交互动，因此研究人员得出结论，这种发展并不一定取决于时间不多的实现。您是否同意这些变化背后的机制可能比我们想象的更基本？</p><p>  I do think that chimpanzees who have survived into old age have adopted healthy habits that promote survival. I don’t think chimpanzees realize life is getting shorter. My speculation is that a couple of things may be happening. Human adolescents are really stimulated by novelty. They like surging emotions, and they like to take risks. This may be true with chimpanzees as well, and it might help them experience new things, reproduce and achieve dominance and status. But it is tiring, so when you have an older body, it might be nice to stay with what is familiar and comfortable. Decreasing energy levels might equally play a role in humans. In addition, [Stanford researcher] Robert Sapolsky found that grooming behavior among older male wild baboons is related to less stress. Perhaps the chimpanzees who were more prosocial and focused on companions that engaged in grooming behavior reaped the benefit of this social support.</p><p>  我确实认为已经幸存成为晚年的黑猩猩采用了促进生存的健康习惯。我不认为黑猩猩意识到生活越来越短。我的猜测是可能发生几件事。人类青少年真的受到新奇的刺激。他们喜欢汹涌的情绪，他们喜欢冒险。对于黑猩猩也可能是真实的，也可能有助于他们体验新事物，重现和实现优势和地位。但它是累人的，所以当你有一个较旧的身体时，留下熟悉和舒适的东西可能很好。减少能量水平可能同样在人类中起作用。此外，[斯坦福研究员] Robert Sapolsky发现，老年男性野生狒狒中的散装行为与压力较小。也许是更神秘和专注于从事梳理行为的同伴的黑猩猩得到了这种社会支持的利益。</p><p>  But of course, we also have these incredible brains that allow us to put things in perspective.</p><p>  但当然，我们也有这些令人难以置信的大脑，让我们能够以透视。</p><p>    Your findings might certainly inspire people to pursue a more positive attitude. At the same time, if you’re someone who is getting older and is unhappy, it might not make you feel better to read this.</p><p>    您的调查结果肯定会激励人们追求更积极的态度。与此同时，如果你是那些年龄较大的人，并且不开心，它可能不会让你感觉更好地读到这一点。</p><p>  For people who are unhappy, it’s really important to look at how to structure your days to feel more fulfilled. I guess for everyone I would say: When you’re making a list of health behaviors, getting enough sleep and exercise and eating right are important factors that most people agree should be included, but social relationships is something that is as important as your cholesterol level, yet is often forgotten. Make sure that you spend time cultivating your social ties, treasuring and prioritizing your close friends and family members, at whatever age you are. Finding purpose and meaning in life is also vitally important. What that is can be different for different people, but finding an important purpose and following that can be very emotionally gratifying.</p><p>  对于那些不开心的人来说，看看如何构建你的日子，以觉得更加满足。我猜我觉得每个人都说：当你制定一个健康行为的列表时，获得足够的睡眠和运动和饮食并进食是大多数人都应包括的重要因素，但社会关系是与你的胆固醇一样重要的东西水平，但经常被遗忘。确保您花时间培养您的社交关系，珍惜和优先考虑您的亲密朋友和家人，无论您是什么年龄。寻找目的和生活中的意义也是重要的。对于不同的人来说，这可能是不同的，但找到一个重要的目的，并以其非常情绪令人欣慰。 </p><p>    Yes. You can be so comfortable that you no longer encounter any challenges, and you really need to stay engaged in cognitive challenges. In a recently published study,  we followed people over eight days. Every night, they were interviewed, and we’d ask about stressors. Did they get into an argument? Was there a situation where they could have argued, but decided not to? Are there any problems at home or at work?</p><p>是的。您可以如此舒适，即您不再遇到任何挑战，您真的需要留在认知挑战中。在最近发表的研究中，我们持续了八天。每天晚上，他们接受了采访，我们会询问压力源。他们是否进入了一个论点？是否有一种情况，他们可以争辩，但决定不应该？家里还是在工作中有任何问题？</p><p>  We asked over 2,500 people about the relatively minor stressors they had experienced, such as a problem at work or an argument, every night over eight days. About 10 percent of the people reported never having experienced even one stressor. They also reported being happier than those who reported at least one stressor. But what we also found was that they performed worse on cognitive tests compared to people who reported at least one stressor. They also reported having received or given less help to others, and that they had spent more time watching TV.</p><p>  我们询问了超过2,500人关于他们经历过的相对较小的压力，如工作或争论的问题，每晚超过八天。约有10％的人报告从未经历过一个压力乐队。他们还报告的比那些报告至少一个压力源的人更幸福。但我们也发现的是，与报告至少一个压力源的人相比，他们对认知测试表现差。他们还报告了收到或对他人的帮助较少，并且他们花了更多的时间看电视。</p><p>  Twenty years ago, we thought that if you have positive relationships and a certain lifestyle, you can have the highest emotional functioning, the highest cognitive functioning, the best physical health, the perfect life for you. Now it turns out to be a little more complicated. People who are reporting being happiest are also not as high in cognitive functioning.</p><p>  二十年前，我们认为如果你有积极的关系和某种生活方式，你可以拥有最高的情感功能，最高的认知功能，最好的身体健康，完美的生活。现在结果表明有点复杂。报告最幸福的人也不高于认知功能。</p><p>  This may be because people who have no stressors are spending less time with other people. The people you know and love are also sometimes the source of your stress. But they also challenge you and engage you in problem-solving activities. So it’s not that you can find optimal well-being in all areas; there might be a tradeoff. It’s like: “I want to be a volunteer, it gives me emotional meaning, I have a lot of purpose in life, but I’m also going to run into some people that may bother me.”</p><p>  这可能是因为没有压力的人与其他人一起度过较少的时间。你认识和爱的人有时候也是你的压力来源。但他们也挑战了你，并在解决问题的活动中吸引你。所以不是你可以在所有领域找到最佳福祉;可能有权衡。就像：“我想成为一名志愿者，它给了我情感意义，我在生活中有很多目的，但我也会遇到一些可能打扰我的人。”</p><p>  So people should strive for some kind of balance? How would you suggest they achieve it?</p><p>  所以人们应该争取某种平衡？你如何建议他们实现它？</p><p>  People definitely should strive for balance, but no one size will fit all. For example, we know that people benefit from having strong social ties, but people vary in the number of close friends and time they spend with others. We know that people need to stay physically active, yet some people prefer swimming and others jogging. We know that activities that are challenging for some people are boring for others.</p><p>  人们肯定应该争取平衡，但没有一种尺寸将适合所有。例如，我们知道人们从拥有强大的社交关系中受益，但人们因与他人共度的亲密朋友和时间而异。我们知道人们需要保持身体活动状态，但有些人更喜欢游泳和其他人慢跑。我们知道对某些人有挑战性的活动对他人来说是无聊的。</p><p>  To achieve balance, people need to know themselves, and make decisions that create dynamic lives where they are socially active and engaged in a way that makes them feel a sense of belonging and makes them feel needed. They need activities that are challenging for them, where they learn new information and have to remember this information — but this could be learning a new musical instrument or learning the layout of a new park or even an alternative world in a video game. They need to engage in physical activity that maintains or even enhances their physical health and functioning.</p><p>  为了实现余额，人们需要了解自己，并制定决定创造动态生活，在那里他们在社会上活跃并从事让他们感受到归属感的方式，让他们感受到所需的方式。他们需要对他们有挑战性的活动，他们学习新信息，并必须记住这些信息 - 但这可能是学习新的乐器或学习新公园的布局甚至在视频游戏中的替代世界。他们需要从事体育活动，以维持或甚至增强其身体健康和运作。 </p><p>  They need to think about their daily lives and how to live so that they engage in behaviors that optimize their physical health, cognitive functioning and emotional well-being.</p><p>他们需要考虑他们的日常生活以及如何生活，以便他们从事优化他们的身体健康，认知功能和情感福祉的行为。</p><p>  Might there be a way for young people to press the fast-forward button to achieve some of the same emotional benefits older people acquire with age, or should they just be patient?</p><p>  年轻人可能有一种方法，以便按前前进的按钮实现老年人随着年龄的增长而达到同样的情绪福利，还是应该耐心等待？</p><p>  In the past 10 years, people have been talking more about  mindfulness as an emotional regulation strategy. That is interesting, because it takes you away from focusing on the future and reminds you that the present moment is the most important. I think those are things that older people often do, but younger people may need to be reminded of. It can really help to have a moment at the end of the week to say, “Right now, things are going well — let’s just enjoy that for today.” It would be wonderful if that was something the youth could learn from older people.</p><p>  在过去的10年里，人们一直在谈论一个情绪化的监管战略。这很有意思，因为它将远离专注于未来，并提醒您现在的时刻是最重要的。我认为这些是老年人经常做的事情，但可能需要提醒年轻人。它真的有助于在一周结束时有一个时刻说：“现在，事情进展顺利 - 让我们享受今天。”如果年轻人可以从老年人学习的东西，那将是很棒的。</p><p>  I think as I grow older, I really understand it more profoundly. I always get a kick out of experiencing what the research shows.</p><p>  我认为随着年龄的增长，我真的很了解它更深刻。我总是在经历研究表演的情况下开始。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-do-older-individuals-have-greater-control-their-feelings-180977693/">https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-do-older-individuals-have-greater-control-their-feelings-180977693/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/感受/">#感受</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/可能/">#可能</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
