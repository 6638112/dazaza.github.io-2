His dad had mostly used it to rock-crawl in the desert outskirts of Los Angeles. The top of the SUV was sawed off and the side windows were smashed out. The doors were so dented they looked like topographic maps. The windshield was scarred, and the gas pedal was missing. When storm clouds gathered, Paul kicked a metal bar to the floor as he tried to outrun the rain.</p><p>Paul Mcbeth首次开始在专业光盘高尔夫锦标赛中跳过主要内容，他在他父亲的1978年闪避Ramcharger中的Crosscross California。他的父亲主要用它来摇滚洛杉矶沙漠郊区。 SUV的顶部被锯掉，侧窗被砸出来。门如此沮丧，他们看起来像地形图。挡风玻璃被伤痕累累，气脚蹬缺失。当风暴云聚集时，保罗在他试图超越雨时向地板踢了一个金属吧。</p><p> His next few cars weren’t much nicer. When he was 19, he found out a friend was planning to dump an Infiniti I30 in the scrapyard and offered to pay him $500 for it. McBeth drove it from L.A. to Kansas City for the  2009 Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA) world championships and  almost all the way back. It blew a gasket 30 minutes from his house. Then there was his Ford Thunderbird that overheated every half-hour on the highway, and his camper van that he thought would save him money on hotels but ended up costing him at the gas pump.</p><p> 他的接下来的几辆车并没有太好更好。当他19岁时，他发现一个朋友计划在Scrapyard倾倒一个英菲尼迪I30，并为他支付500美元。 Mcbeth将其从L.A.到2009年专业光盘高尔夫协会（PDGA）世界锦标赛的堪萨斯城，几乎一路回来。它从他的房子里吹了30分钟的垫子。然后，他的森林雷鸟在高速公路上每半小时过热，他认为他认为他会在酒店拯救他的钱，但最终在燃气泵上耗费了他的钱。</p><p> Finally, in 2011, after winning $4,000 for taking first place at the Memorial Championship in Scottsdale, Arizona, McBeth had saved enough money to buy a new car. He wanted a Jeep Patriot. The problem was the paperwork. “Under occupation, I put ‘professional athlete,’” McBeth says. “I guess they didn’t believe me because they wouldn’t let me finance it. I ended up having to buy the car with cash.”</p><p> 最后，在2011年，在亚利桑那州斯科茨代尔纪念冠军纪念冠军赛中获奖4000美元，麦克巴已经挽救了足够的钱来买一辆新车。他想要一个吉普爱国者。问题是文书工作。 “在职业下，我把”专业运动员“放了”“麦克巴斯说。 “我猜他们不相信我，因为他们不会让我融资它。我最终不得不用现金购买汽车。“</p><p> In the decade since, McBeth’s disc golf career has soared. He’s won the PDGA world championship five times and the United States Disc Golf championship twice. In 2010, the PDGA championship’s total purse was  $33,782; at this week’s event, the men’s winnings are expected to be upward of  $150,000. McBeth has earned more than  half a million dollars from his performances. He is, undoubtedly, the most accomplished disc golfer in the world.</p><p> 十年来，麦克巴斯的圆盘高尔夫职业生涯飙升。他赢得了PDGA世界锦标赛五次和美国光盘高尔夫锦标赛两次。 2010年，PDGA锦标赛的总钱包为33,782美元;在本周的活动，人们的奖金预计将在15万美元上升。麦克巴斯从他的表演中获得了超过50万美元的比赛。毫无疑问，他是世界上最成熟的光盘。</p><p> But except to a subset of hardcore frisbee fans, his more impressive accomplishments have come away from the course. In February, disc golf manufacturer Discraft announced it had extended McBeth’s endorsement deal to a  guaranteed  $10 million over 10 years. McBeth also has sponsors for other disc golf gear, such as grip equipment and bags, and owns part of a company called Foundation Disc Golf that produces both products and content. He has deals outside of disc golf equipment too, with the likes of Adidas and Celsius energy drink. According to 2019 data from the  athlete marketing platform Opendorse, only about 70 athletes in the world make at least a million dollars a year in endorsement deals. McBeth’s endorsement income from Discraft alone puts him on par with Bears linebacker Khalil Mack, Jazz guard Mike Conley Jr., and Astros pitcher Justin Verlander.</p><p> 但除了铁杆FRISBEE粉丝的子集外，他更令人印象深刻的成就来自课程。 2月份，碟片高尔夫制造商宣布已将McBeth的认可协议延长至1000万超过10亿美元。 McBeth还为其他圆盘高尔夫齿轮提供赞助商，例如握把设备和袋子，并拥有一部分代表基础碟形高尔夫的公司，这些公司生产产品和内容。他也在薄盘高尔夫设备之外涉及adidas和celsius能量饮料。根据2019年的运动员营销平台的数据，世界上只有大约70名运动员每年至少达到一百万美元的认可交易。麦克白的认可收入来自剥夺剥夺的人让他与熊线卫Khalil Mack，Jazz Guard Mike Conley Jr.和Astros Pitcher Justin Verlander相提并论。</p><p> “Under occupation, I put ‘professional athlete.’ I guess they didn’t believe me because they wouldn’t let me finance it. I ended up having to buy the car with cash.” —Paul McBeth</p><p> “在职业下，我把”专业运动员“放了。”我猜他们不相信我，因为他们不会让我资助它。我最终不得不用现金购买汽车。“ -Paul Mcbeth.</p><p> McBeth has carved out a lucrative career in a niche sport, in part as an athlete and in part as an influencer. He isn’t alone in using this blueprint. Competitors in sports ranging from bowling to lacrosse have been able to amass riches by building their brands—and growing the games they love along the way.</p><p> Mcbeth在一个利润丰厚的职业生涯中，部分是运动员，部分是运动员，部分是一种影响因素。他不孤单地使用这个蓝图。通过保龄球到曲棍区的运动竞争对手已经能够通过建立他们的品牌来实现丰富的富裕人士 - 并沿着他们沿途的游戏成长。 </p><p> “I think about it as a three-step funnel,” says Li Jin, the founder of the digital marketing platform Atelier Ventures who coined the term “Passion Economy” to describe how influencers monetize social media. The first step is to attract a big audience on a known platform, like Instagram or Twitter. The second is to bring them to a platform the influencer owns, such as a newsletter or podcast. The final step is to turn people into paying customers. “That,” she says, “is how influencers turn social capital into financial capital.”</p><p>“我认为这是一个三步漏斗，”数字营销平台的创始人李金斯·斯莱尔冒险的创始人说，他们创造了“激情经济”一词，以描述影响者如何通过社交媒体。第一步是在已知的平台上吸引大量观众，如Instagram或Twitter。第二个是将它们带到了影响者拥有的平台，例如时事通讯或播客。最后一步是让人们付钱给客户。 “那，”她说，“影响者如何将社会资本转化为金融资本。”</p><p> McBeth agreed to that $10 million deal in July 2020 after hosting a paintball party for his 30th birthday. A couple of months later, he signed the paperwork at Discraft’s headquarters in Michigan. In November, he shared a  series of stories with his 150,000-plus Instagram followers. The first showed a trailer from a car dealership in Michigan. The second and third showed glamorous shots of his latest car purchase: a McLaren 570S Spider. The luxury convertible—which starts at more than $200,000—has switchblade doors and a retractable roof.</p><p> 麦克斯于2020年7月同意10万美元的交易，以为他的30岁生日举办彩粉扑派对。几个月后，他在密歇根州的撤资总部签了文书工作。 11月，他与他150,000个加上的Instagram粉丝分享了一系列故事。第一个展示了密歇根州的汽车经销商的拖车。第二和第三次显示最新汽车的迷人镜头：迈凯轮570s蜘蛛。奢侈品敞篷车 - 以200万美元的开工开头 - 具有转换门和可伸缩的屋顶。</p><p>   By now you may have started browsing for disc golf gear in another tab. But before you complete your order, you first need to figure out how to get anyone’s attention. Not long ago, niche sports cracked the national consciousness only as punch lines. In a now-iconic  Seinfeld episode, George Costanza gets a severance package from the Yankees—enough to sustain him for an entire summer—and tells Jerry he’s going to learn to play frolf.</p><p>   到目前为止，您可能已开始在另一个标签中浏览磁盘高尔夫齿轮。但在完成订单之前，首先需要弄清楚如何让任何人的注意力。不久前，利基体育才会像拳头线一样破解国家意识。在一个现在的Iconic Seinfeld集中，乔治科斯坦扎从洋基队获得遣散套餐 - 足以让他全年夏天维持他 - 并告诉杰里他会学会玩暑假。</p><p>    In the 2004 comedy  Dodgeball, Vince Vaughn’s group of misfits face off against Ben Stiller’s crew of hulking weightlifters on a fictional channel called ESPN 8: The Ocho. The parody network became such a cultural phenomenon that in 2017 ESPN launched an annual “ Ocho TV” day, featuring events like the National Stone Skipping Competition and World Sign Spinning Championship. (How sign spinning became an international competition before stone skipping is a mystery best explored in a separate story.) But those so-called joke sports have had the last laugh. From 2017 to 2019, ESPN’s the Ocho ratings  climbed year over year. Last May, a deadlift world record attempt drew more than  300,000 viewers—the network’s most-watched program of the day.</p><p>    在2004年喜剧躲避球上，Vince Vaughn的不合适群体对阵Ben Stiller的船员的船员，在一个名为ESPN 8的虚构渠道上的令人兴奋的人：Ocho。模仿网络成为这一文化现象，即2017年ESPN推出了一年一度的“Ocho电视”日，以国家石头跳过竞争和世界标志纺纱锦标赛为特色。 （在石头跳水之前，签署旋转是一种国际竞争，是一个独立的故事探索的谜团。）但那些所谓的开玩笑运动已经笑了。从2017年到2019年，ESPN的Ocho评分升起了一年。最后一个可能，一个止血世界纪录尝试吸引了300多万观众 - 网络的最佳计划的最佳节目。</p><p> For many niche sports, television is still seen as the ultimate status symbol. Some leagues have gone so far as to buy air time for their biggest events. Last year, Dynamic Discs paid the CBS Sports Network “ in excess of six figures” to broadcast their disc golf tournament. This stands in contrast to networks’ relationships with the more prominent sports leagues. In March, the NFL  secured $113 billion from its television partners for the rights to air football games over the next 11 years.</p><p> 对于许多利基体育，电视仍被视为终极状态符号。一些联赛到目前为止为他们最大的活动购买空气时间。去年，动态光盘支付了CBS体育网络“超过六个数字”以广播他们的光盘高尔夫锦标赛。这与网络与更突出的体育联盟的关系相反。 3月，NFL在其电视伙伴中获得了1130亿美元，以便在未来11年内获得空中足球比赛的权利。</p><p> But television isn’t the only way to command mass attention. For smaller sports and their stars, social media provides access to massive audiences without traditional gatekeepers. “To millions of kids, TikTok and YouTube are mainstream entertainment. They don’t watch TV,” says Taylor Lorenz, who covers social media, Gen Z, and influencers for  The New York Times. “Sometimes you need to get onto TV to get credibility with boomer CEOs. But for individuals, you can often monetize better on your social media.”</p><p> 但电视不是指挥群众关注的唯一途径。对于较小的体育及其明星来说，社交媒体提供了没有传统守门人的大规模观众。 “到数百万个孩子，Tiktok和YouTube是主流娱乐。他们不看电视，“泰勒洛伦茨说，他们涵盖社交媒体，Z Z和纽约时报的影响力。 “有时您需要通过Boomer CeoS获得可信度。但对于个人来说，您通常可以在您的社交媒体上更好地货币化。“</p><p>  The surest path to profitability is to go viral. And the kings of the viral clip are the dudes from Dude Perfect. What began as a series of stunts by college roommates at Texas A&amp;M has turned into the most popular sports channel on YouTube. Dude Perfect has nearly twice as many subscribers (56 million) as four major U.S. sports leagues—the NBA (16.7 million), NFL (7.8 million), MLB (3.0 million), and NHL (1.6 million)—combined. Its  water bottle flips and  ping-pong tricks have reshaped what constitutes athletic accomplishment online. And its influence echoes across the niche sports landscape. (The dudes declined to be interviewed for this story.)</p><p>  盈利能力的最可靠程度是病毒性的。和病毒夹的国王是来自家伙完美的家伙。在德克萨斯州A＆amp的大学室营地是一系列特技的何种营业队.M已经变成了YouTube最受欢迎的体育频道。 Dude Perfect有几家用户的用户（5600万）是四个主要的美国体育联盟 -  NBA（1670万），NFL（780万），MLB（3000万）和NHL（1.6亿） - 组合。它的水瓶翻转和平躺的技巧重塑了在线体育成就的内容。它影响了整个利基体育景观的回声。 （该伙计拒绝接受这个故事。） </p><p> McBeth is friends and business partners with Brodie Smith, a former ultimate player who became internet famous for his frisbee trick shots and has collaborated on three videos with Dude Perfect. Smith, who boasts more than 2 million YouTube subscribers and almost a million Instagram and Twitter followers, instantly became the world’s most famous disc golf player when he turned pro in late 2019. Smith has documented his journey into the sport, and has learned the finer points of the game from McBeth. In exchange, Smith has schooled McBeth on the finer points of internet fame. “Brodie has made everyone in disc golf up their YouTube game,” McBeth says. “He’s inspired me a lot. We used to try to find the time to post videos when we could. Now we make the time. It’s become a priority.”</p><p>Mcbeth是一名前终极球员的朋友和商业伙伴，这是一个成为互联网为他的飞盘捣蛋而闻名的互联网，并在一个带有家伙完美的三个视频合作。史密斯州夸耀的YouTube订阅者和近一百万的Instagram和Twitter粉丝，当他在2019年底转为职业时，即立即成为世界上最着名的薄片高尔夫球运动员。史密斯已经记录了他进入这项运动的旅程，并学会了更精细的旅程来自麦克巴斯的比赛。在Exchange中，史密斯在互联网名声的粮食点上学了麦克白。 “布罗迪让每个人都在碟形高尔夫球上youtube游戏中，”麦克巴斯说。 “他激起了我很多。我们曾经尝试在我们可以的时候找到发布视频的时间。现在我们花时间。它成为一个优先事项。“</p><p>  Jason Belmonte, the most accomplished professional bowler in the world, has collaborated on two videos with Dude Perfect. The first—which shows him whizzing bowling balls past the dudes’ heads and breaking flying plates with bowling pins—has accumulated almost 100 million views. According to  Aux Mode, a digital service that projects the value of YouTube videos, 100 million views translates to about $400,000 of revenue. The popularity of a channel and its engagement rate can increase the value of those videos even further.</p><p>  杰森贝尔蒙特是世界上最成熟的职业队员，在两个视频中合作完美。首先显示他令人叹好的保龄球，经过帅哥的头部，并破坏销钉的飞行板 - 已经积累了近1亿景观。根据AUX MODE的说法，一个项目的数字服务，将youtube视频的价值，1亿视图转化为约400,000美元的收入。频道的普及及其参与率可以进一步提高这些视频的价值。</p><p>  “Some people in my fan base can recite every single stunt I performed in those videos but don’t know how many titles I’ve won,” says Belmonte, who’s captured 25 Professional Bowlers Association titles, including a record 13 major championships. “Entertainment is king right now. Whether you’re bowling around a dude’s head or doing the world’s longest strike, entertainment is what sticks in people’s minds.”</p><p>  “我的粉丝群中的一些人可以背诵我在这些视频中表演的每一个特技，但不知道我赢了多少个标题，”佩尔蒙特说，他抓住了25名专业的投篮协会的标题，包括一个纪录的13个主要冠军。 “现在娱乐是王子。无论您是保龄球围系，还是在做世界上最长的罢工，娱乐就是人们的思想。“</p><p> Until television rights deals increase enough to start funding substantial salaries in niche sports, social media is the best way for these athletes to earn a living. Life-changing money  is out there, but they do have to earn it.</p><p> 直到电视权交易增加足以开始在利基体育中的大量薪水，社交媒体是这些运动员谋生的最佳方式。改变生活的钱在那里，但他们确实必须赚钱。</p><p>  When Jennifer Delaney was a little girl, her father fastened a string to two ends of a stick to create a makeshift bow and instill in her a love of archery. As an MBA candidate at SMU, she rediscovered this passion as a way to relieve her stress from school and networking events. Her mother thought she should have taken up a “normal” sport, like golf. In the beginning, Delaney wondered whether she was right. “For the first few months, I had bruises and blood blisters on my hands and fingers,” Delaney says. “I got mosquito bites from being outside so much. I got torn up.”</p><p>  当Jennifer Delaney是一个小女孩时，她的父亲将一个绳子固定在一根棍子的两端，以创造一个临时弓，灌输她对射箭的热爱。作为SMU的MBA候选人，她将这种激情重新发现了一种缓解学校和网络事件的压力。她的母亲认为她应该服用一个“正常”的运动，如高尔夫。一开始，Delaney想知道她是否正确。 “在最初的几个月里，我的手和手指上有瘀伤和血液水泡，”Delaney说。 “我得到了如此之外的蚊虫叮咬。我被撕裂了。“</p><p>  To break up the monotony of practice, she started imagining more intricate targets. She launched a TikTok account called Freedom and Feathers, and made a video in which she  shot a swinging tic tac into a tic-tac-toe board. She has used arrows to  light a match and  blow out a candle. In her most popular video, which has more than 7 million views, she tosses a tennis ball in the air and pierces it as it descends. Delaney does this on top of her day job as a consultant, and estimates she spends between 30 minutes and a full weekend purchasing supplies and constructing targets. Filming the videos can take anywhere from a few minutes—she shot through a Life Saver on her third try—to a few days. And the process doesn’t end there.</p><p>  为了分解练习的单调，她开始想象更复杂的目标。她推出了一个名为自由和羽毛的Tiktok账户，并制作了一个视频，她在其中拍摄了一个摇摆的Tic Tac进入Tic-Tac-Toe板。她使用箭头点亮匹配并吹出蜡烛。在她最受欢迎的视频中，它有超过700万景观，她在空中扔了一个网球，并在下降时刺穿它。 Delaney在她的日常工作之上是一项顾问，并估计她在30分钟之间花费了30分钟，并在一个完整的周末购买用品和构建目标。拍摄视频可以在几分钟的任何地方拍摄 - 她在她的第三次尝试上拍摄了救生人员。而这个过程没有结束那里。</p><p> Every time she posts a video to her nearly 1 million TikTok followers, Delaney sets a goal to respond to at least 50 comments. Even though she keeps a note on her phone with standard responses to FAQs, she can’t ever clear her backlog of DMs. Still, she spends hours a day responding, because she sees how it inspires girls to get into the sport, and she wants to create a sense of community.</p><p> 每次她将视频发布到近100万Tiktok粉丝时，Delaney都会设立一个目标，以回应至少50条评论。尽管她在手机上保留了对常见问题解答的标准响应的笔记，但她无法清除她的积极的DMS。尽管如此，她每天花几个小时的回应，因为她看到它是如何激励女孩进入这项运动的，她想造成一个社区感。 </p><p> “How do small sports become big ones? I got interested in that question because I really love disc golf,” says Joshua Woods, a sociology professor at West Virginia who studies alternative sports and serves as the editor of the disc golf website  Parked. “And that’s part of the answer to the question: a critical mass of people become emotionally connected to a sport. People like Paul McBeth are getting paid because they can cut through the noise, and there’s so much noise in the age of the internet. Passionate fans can feel like they’re part of an intimate community.”</p><p>“小运动如何成为大？我对这个问题感兴趣，因为我真的爱光盘高尔夫球，“西弗吉尼亚州西弗吉尼亚州的社会学教授说，替代运动，作为停放的碟片高尔夫网站的编辑。 “这就是问题答案的一部分：批判性的人在情绪上与运动相连。像Paul Mcbeth这样的人正在获得报酬，因为他们可以通过噪音，并且互联网时代的噪音很大。热情的粉丝可以觉得他们是一个亲密社区的一部分。“</p><p> Even the most active NBA fans don’t expect stars to respond to social media messages. (Unless they have talked shit about Kevin Durant, in which case they’ll absolutely hear back. Hi, KD.) But the fans of niche sports sometimes feel a sense of ownership over those sports, and a sense of entitlement when interacting with their stars. Spending so much time sorting through comments can make it hard for those athletes to filter out the trolls. Delaney says that she gets daily sexist messages from men who claim what she does is easy. “They’ll say, ‘Big deal, someone has already done that particular shot.’ And I’m like, ‘Basketball players have made shots from every spot on the floor. That doesn’t make a half-court shot any less impressive.’”</p><p> 即使是最活跃的NBA粉丝也不会指望明星来回应社交媒体信息。 （除非他们谈论了关于凯文杜兰特的狗屎，在这种情况下，他们绝对会听到。嗨，KD。）但是利基运动的粉丝有时会对这些运动的所有权感，以及与他们互动时的权利感。星星。通过评论来排序的花费这么多时间可以使那些运动员难以过滤巨魔。 Delaney说，她从人们那些声称她所做的人那里获得日常性别歧视信息。 “他们会说，”大交易，有人已经完成了那种特定的镜头。“我就像我一样，”篮球运动员已经从地板上的每一席都拍了镜头。这不会让半法院射击任何更少的令人印象深刻。“</p><p> “Some people in my fan base can recite every single stunt I performed in those videos but don’t know how many titles I’ve won. Entertainment is king right now.” —Jason Belmonte</p><p> “我的粉丝群中的一些人可以背诵我在这些视频中执行的每一个特技，但不知道我赢了多少头衔。娱乐现在是王子。“ -jason belmonte.</p><p> When Belmonte first started bowling as a child, he couldn’t lift the ball, so he pioneered the practice of bowling with both hands. While most players bowl using a single arm, Belmonte  uses both to improve his power and control. That style makes him stand out the way Rick Barry once did with his underhanded free throw shooting. When Belmonte began competing professionally, he was inundated with comments about his form. “It’s funny how you can scroll right past a thousand positive comments and focus on the one negative comment you see,” he says. “It took me a long time to learn how to deal with that.”</p><p> 当Belmonte首先开始保龄球时，他无法举起球，所以他和双手保龄球的做法是开创的。虽然大多数玩家使用单个臂，但贝尔蒙特使用两者都可以提高他的力量和控制。这种风格让他突出了Rick Barry曾经用他的罚球罚球射击拍摄的方式。当Belmonte开始专业竞争时，他对他的表格进行了评论。 “这很有趣，你如何滚动过去一千个积极评论，并专注于你所看到的一个负面评论，”他说。 “我花了很长时间才学习如何处理这一点。”</p><p> He later learned that some of those online trolls were actually his competitors in the lanes. He says that several times he’s walked into the locker room—yes, there are locker rooms for bowlers—and overheard other bowlers whispering about how they’d created burner accounts to harass him. “I used to tell them ‘Don’t hide behind a username. Say it to my face.’  Then they’d deny it,” Belmonte says. “Now my reply is ‘I have more of everything than you do. There’s nothing you have that I would want.’”</p><p> 他后来才了解，一些在线巨魔实际上是他在车道上的竞争对手。他说，他几次他走进更衣室 - 是的，有储物柜的更衣室 - 无意中窃听他们如何创建燃烧器帐户来骚扰他。 “我曾经告诉过他们'不要躲在用户名后面。说到我的脸上。“然后他们否认了它，”贝尔蒙特说。 “现在我的回复是'我有比你更多的一切。没有你想要的东西。“</p><p> Belmonte also credits his unusual style for his success on social media. He’s by far the most popular bowler across all of the major platforms, with 130,000 Instagram followers, 44,000 Twitter followers, and 66,000 YouTube subscribers. His bios online tout his unusual style, and his email signature reads, “This email was typed using #2HANDS.” He has double-handedly changed the game of bowling for professionals and amateurs alike, many of whom trace their ability to enjoy the sport to his trailblazing style. That sense of community can be lucrative for Belmonte, who regularly releases  limited-edition merchandise for $25 to $60 on Instagram. He says those sales, which number in the thousands every year, provide “fantastic supplementary income.”</p><p> Belmonte在社交媒体上取得了成功，也可以赞同他的不寻常的风格。他是迄今为止所有主要平台上最受欢迎的备向，130,000名Instagram粉丝，44,000名推特粉丝和66,000名YouTube订阅者。他的BIOS在线推出他不寻常的风格，以及他的电子邮件签名阅读，“此电子邮件是使用＃2hands键入的。”他已经双手改变了专业人士和业余爱好者的保龄球游戏，其中许多人追踪他们享受这项运动的能力。对于贝尔蒙特来说，社区意识可以利润，他们经常在Instagram上释放25％至60美元的限量版商品。他说那些销售，每年数千人，提供“奇妙的补充收入”。</p><p> “In niche sports, social media is 10 times—maybe 100 times—more important to an athlete than it is in mainstream sports,” Belmonte says. “Mainstream sports stars get constant TV coverage. They’re in people’s faces all the time. If you’re in a niche sport, you have to tell people what you have coming up and what you’ve achieved. You want people to feel like they’re a part of this journey.”</p><p> “在利基体育中，社交媒体是10次 - 也许100次 - 对运动员比主流运动更重要，”贝尔蒙特说。 “主流运动明星获得恒定的电视覆盖范围。他们一直在人们的脸上。如果你是在一个利基运动中，你必须告诉别人你已经出现了什么以及你所取得的成就。你希望人们觉得他们是这一旅程的一部分。“ </p><p>  As she was languishing last summer before her freshman year at Aquinas College in Michigan, volleyball player Chloe Mitchell decided—like so many of us during the pandemic—that she had seen just about enough of her family. Behind her house was a storage space with dusty walls and rusty bicycles, so she asked her parents for permission to convert it into a “she shed.” She’d recently gotten into TikTok, and posted a video documenting the change to her account. Within four days, it had accumulated a million views. By the time the shed was transformed, so too was her life. She had more than a million followers, and no idea what to do next.</p><p>正如她去年夏天在密歇根州阿奎那学院的新生年萎缩，那样，排球球员Chloe Mitchell在大流行期间决定了我们的许多人 - 她已经看到了她的家人。她的房子后面是一个尘土飞扬的墙壁和生锈的自行车的存储空间，所以她让父母允许将它转换为“她棚”。她最近进入了Tiktok，并发布了一个视频，记录了她的帐户的变更。在四天内，它累积了一百万个观点。到棚子被改造时，她的生活也是如此。她有超过一百万追随者，不知道下一步怎么办。</p><p> @chloevmitchell  It’s DONEEEE! Thank you for watching the process and having fun with me.

When my followers started going back up after my second project, I knew I could sustain something.”</p><p> 她不想成为一个剪辑的奇迹，所以她回到了一个新项目之前，她几周休息了：改造她与兄弟分享的浴室。 “在第一个项目结束后，我在追随者中的这种大规模减少了，”她说。 “是一个刚刚发生的Tiktok明星，它不是我身份的一部分。当我的追随者在我的第二个项目后开始备份时，我知道我可以维持一些东西。“</p><p>  Mitchell’s fame had nothing to do with volleyball. Nonetheless, NCAA name, image, and likeness (NIL) rules would have prevented her from collecting any profits from her social media success. During recruiting, Mitchell nearly committed to an NCAA Division II school, which would’ve cost her dearly. Instead, she chose to compete at the NAIA level, which  granted athletes NIL rights in October 2020. Mitchell is now  believed to be the first college athlete to make money from endorsements. (Well,   legal money anyway.) Since then, she has earned enough to buy a laptop and a car, as well as pay off her student debt. She’s saving up for her next project: flipping a house.</p><p>  米切尔的名气与排球无关。尽管如此，NCAA名称，图像和相似性（零）规则将阻止她从社交媒体成功中收集任何利润。在招聘期间，米切尔近乎致力于一个NCAA部门的学校，这将是她的沉重的。相反，她选择竞争于2020年10月授予的尼亚权利的奈亚水平。米切尔现在被认为是第一位从认可中赚钱的大学运动员。 （嗯，无论如何，法律钱。）从那时起，她已经获得了足够的赚取笔记本电脑和一辆车，以及偿还她的学生债务。她正在为她的下一个项目省钱：翻转房子。</p><p> As soon as this summer, NCAA athletes in states such as Florida and Mississippi will gain NIL rights. Sensing that seismic shift in the economics of college sports, Mitchell and her father, Keith, founded a company called PlayBooked. PlayBooked already has four full-time employees and has connected more than 130 NAIA athletes to paid social media sponsorship opportunities. Keith is so bullish on its prospects he turned down venture capital funding and predicts that there will be a PlayBooked Bowl by 2025.</p><p> 今年夏天，佛罗里达州和密西西比等各州的NCAA运动员将获得无权。感知大学生，米切尔和父亲，基思经济学的地震转变，成立了一家名为PlayBooked的公司。 PlayBooked已经拥有四名全职员工，已连接超过130名NAIA运动员来支付社交媒体赞助机会。 Keith对其前景看好，他拒绝了风险投资资金，并预测到2025年将有一个戏剧碗。</p><p> For athletes in niche sports, their college tenures often represent the peak of their popularity. Being able to make endorsement money, then, would be an absolute game-changer. “The riches,” Keith says, “are in the niches.”</p><p> 对于利基体育的运动员，他们的大学职业经常代表他们受欢迎程度的高峰。然后，能够提出认可的钱，将是一个绝对的游戏更换者。 “财富”，“Keith说，”在利基。“ </p><p> Myles Jones first started getting interested in Instagram while he was playing lacrosse at Duke. Every time his team played on ESPNU, he’d return to his phone to discover a few hundred additional followers. He was majoring in marketing at the time, and wanted to test his ability to build his own brand. He was so successful that on the day after his 2016 graduation, STX Lacrosse representatives flew out to ink him to an endorsement deal. Within a few months, he’d also signed with Adidas and made a few thousand dollars for promoting a protein powder on Instagram.</p><p>Myles Jones首先在杜克演奏曲棍球时，开始对Instagram感兴趣。每当他的团队在ESPNU上播放时，他都会回到他的手机来发现几百个额外的粉丝。他当时主要在营销中，并希望测试他建立自己品牌的能力。他非常成功，在他的2016年毕业后的一天，Stx Lacrosse代表飞出了墨水诠释着罪名。在几个月内，他还签署了阿迪达斯，并在Instagram上促进蛋白质粉末进行了几千美元。</p><p> “In niche sports, social media is 10 times—maybe 100 times—more important to an athlete than it is in mainstream sports. You want people to feel like they’re a part of this journey.” —Jason Belmonte</p><p> “在利基体育中，社交媒体是10次 - 也许100次 - 对运动员比在主流运动中更重要。你希望人们觉得他们是这一旅程的一部分。“ -jason belmonte.</p><p> In November, Jones signed a major endorsement deal with Degree. He declined to reveal the exact dollar figure involved, but said he thought his agent had typed an extra zero at the end of the number when he read the text confirming the details. Yet Jones says the meaning of the deal was as significant as the money. “I was stepping into the non-endemic space. A lot of what guys are selling in lacrosse is equipment—sticks and goals. I felt like I was bridging the gap between a small sport and the mainstream culture. You can’t buy lacrosse gear at the supermarket, but everybody needs deodorant.”</p><p> 11月，琼斯与学位签署了一个重大的认可协议。他拒绝揭示所涉及的确切数字，但表示他认为他的代理人在读取了确认细节的文本时，他的代理人在数量结束时键入了零零。然而琼斯说，这笔​​交易的含义与金钱一样重要。 “我正在进入非地方性空间。很多人在长曲棍球上销售的是设备 - 棍棒和目标。我觉得我正在弥合小运动与主流文化之间的差距。你不能在超市买曲棍球装备，但每个人都需要除臭剂。“</p><p> Even in mainstream sports, most athletes rely on apparel companies like Nike or Adidas as their primary sponsors. And while deals like LeBron James’s lifetime contract with Nike make national headlines, most athletes have what are known as merchandise deals. They don’t get money, but they get as many products as they want. Only the big names receive cash deals, and even then the payout—in the low six figures, if they’re lucky—is generally pennies compared to their contracts. Only the megastars make millions from endorsements.</p><p> 即使在主流运动中，大多数运动员也依赖于耐克或阿迪达斯这样的服装公司作为他们的主要赞助商。虽然勒布朗詹姆斯的终身合同等交易使国家头条新闻，大多数运动员都有所谓的商品交易。他们没有赚钱，但他们就像他们想要的产品一样。只有大名获准收到现金交易，即使是低六个数字，如果他们的合同相比，他们通常是便士的。只有Megastars从认可中赚取数百万。</p><p> Yet while mainstream athletes often live off their sport salaries alone, niche sport athletes typically have to rely on multiple income streams. Delaney, the consultant and archer, works full time in addition to collecting between $3,000 and $5,000 a month from Freedom and Feathers. Belmonte and Jones make money as TV commentators when they aren’t competing and posting. But for them and other athletes in niche sports, there’s a goal in these games more elusive than riches: glory.</p><p> 然而，虽然主流运动员往往仅仅独自过运动薪水，但利基体育运动员通常必须依靠多个收入流。 Delaney，顾问和弓箭手，除了在自由和羽毛中每月收集3,000至5,000美元的全部时间。当他们没有竞争和发布时，贝尔蒙特和琼斯将钱作为电视评论员赚钱。但对于他们和其他运动员在利基运动中，这些游戏的目标比财富更难以捉摸：荣耀。</p><p> “There’s an obvious monetary incentive to building your social media,” Jones says. “There’s something else to it to</p><p> “建立社交媒体有明显的货币激励，”琼斯说。 “它有其他东西</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theringer.com/features/2021/6/21/22542839/disc-golf-niche-sports-million-dollar-endorsement-deals">https://www.theringer.com/features/2021/6/21/22542839/disc-golf-niche-sports-million-dollar-endorsement-deals</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/名人/">#名人</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/golf/">#golf</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/运动员/">#运动员</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
