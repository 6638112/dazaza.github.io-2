We are lucky to have one									of the most interesting founders in technology and commerce - Tobi Lütke, Founder									and CEO of Shopify. This interview was published on December 16th, 2020.</p><p>欢迎来到“观察者效应”的第三次采访。我们很高兴拥有最有趣的技术和商业创始人之一-Shopify的创始人兼首席执行官TobiLütke。该采访于2020年12月16日发布。</p><p>  Tobi is one of the most thoughtful and first principles oriented founders I&#39;ve met and								this was a fascinating conversation. Enjoy!</p><p>  托比（Tobi）是我见过的最有思想，最注重原则的创始人之一，这是一次有趣的对话。请享用！</p><p>   Sriram Krishnan    Let’s start with the basics. Walk me through a typical day in the life of										Tobi Lütke.</p><p>   Sriram Krishnan让我们从基础开始。带领我度过TobiLütke人生中典型的一天。</p><p>      Here’s the honest answer: obviously I have a schedule and people helping me manage my								time, however, I think a lot about where to devote my attention. In this way, there is								no typical day.</p><p>      诚实的答案是：很明显，我有一个日程安排，有人在帮助我安排时间，但是，我想了很多事情要放在哪里。这样，就没有典型的一天。</p><p>  My attention is the most liquid and valuable resource that I have. Even back in the day								when Shopify went public, I spent a good deal of time pre-selling the various investors.								During meetings, I would say, “Hey, I&#39;m here, and we&#39;ve been doing this roadshow, but I								actually spend a lot of my time on the product.” This was to set expectations because I								knew I wasn&#39;t going to attend very many investor conferences. Fundamentally, my								attention belonged to the product, not to the sales and marketing of it.</p><p>  我的注意力是我拥有的最流动和最有价值的资源。甚至在Shopify上市的那天，我就花了很多时间预售各种投资者。在会议期间，我会说：“嘿，我在这里，我们一直在做这个路演，但实际上我在产品上花了很多时间。”这是为了设定期望，因为我知道我不会参加很多投资者会议。从根本上讲，我的注意力属于产品，而不是产品的销售和营销。</p><p>  A day in my life really depends on what&#39;s happening. That said, usually I have themes.								For instance, I have a priority list, and I have decision logs that chronicle all the								things I am trying to figure out.</p><p>  我生命中的一天真的取决于发生的事情。也就是说，通常我都有主题。例如，我有一个优先级列表，并且我有决策日志记录了我要弄清楚的所有事情。</p><p>  These cover different questions. For example, if I had just taken the company over, how								would I change it? How would I build a company to potentially disrupt Shopify? I try to								make my calendar match these bigger topics and other urgent priorities. In a way, the								calendar is nothing more than a strategy. Although it&#39;s incredibly easy—and it has								happened to me quite a lot—to have circumstances dictate the calendar. Because of this,								there’s this constant tug of war between the actual priorities of the company and the								kind of things that have to be done.</p><p>  这些涵盖了不同的问题。例如，如果我刚刚接手公司，我将如何对其进行变更？我将如何建立一家可能破坏Shopify的公司？我试图使我的日历与这些更大的主题和其他紧迫的优先事项相匹配。在某种程度上，日历只不过是一种策略。尽管由环境决定日历是一件非常容易的事，而且对我来说这已经发生了很多。因此，在公司的实际优先事项与必须完成的事情之间存在着不断的拉锯战。 </p><p>  So, I end up trying to insert themes into my days. Like today, for instance, I have a								meeting with my small team to begin the week; I reserved my afternoon for product								reviews—what we call “greenpathing exercises”—where, oddly, I&#39;m trying to discern how								everyone is thinking about the main things we&#39;re working on. I do this because								oftentimes I feel as though I am the connective tissue combining operations, finance,								and more formal business functions with the product itself. This connection helps me to								make good decisions.</p><p>因此，我最终尝试将主题插入我的生活中。例如，像今天一样，我和我的小团队开会开始了这一周。我将下午留在产品评论（我们称之为“绿色路径练习”）上，奇怪的是，我试图在其中辨别每个人如何思考我们正在从事的主要工作。之所以这样做，是因为我常常觉得自己是将产品的运营，财务和更正式的业务功能结合在一起的结缔组织。这种联系有助于我做出正确的决定。</p><p>  Lastly, on Wednesdays, Shopify doesn&#39;t do scheduled meetings. Usually, I have a list of								memos to read or reactions to record to various mock-ups and so on. This is basically my								very loosely defined schedule.</p><p>  最后，在星期三，Shopify不会安排预定的会议。通常，我有一份要阅读的备忘录列表或要记录到各种模型的反应等。这基本上是我非常松散定义的时间表。</p><p>      How do you work with your so-called “expansion pack team” on reallocating your										portfolio management on time? What does that loop look like?</p><p>      您如何与您的所谓“扩展包团队”一起按时重新分配投资组合管理？该循环是什么样的？</p><p>  A lot of this is almost automatic by just having a good color coding system, which is								really fun.								 [laughs]</p><p>  只要拥有一个良好的颜色编码系统，其中的大多数几乎都是自动的，这真的很有趣。 [笑]</p><p>  At one point, I started complaining about blue weeks where every single time slot was								taken. And someone said, “Well, if you don&#39;t like blue, I can make any color.” And I								replied, “Well, how about we color based on leverage?” And that’s just what we did.</p><p>  有一次，我开始抱怨每个星期都被占用的蓝色星期。有人说：“好吧，如果您不喜欢蓝色，我可以制造任何颜色。”我回答说：“那么，我们如何根据杠杆作用着色？”这就是我们所做的。</p><p>  We ended up labeling my product-related things red, investor/Board of Director-related								things some kind of teal color, et cetera. And the thing I’m looking for is a balanced								week; a week where, ideally, I manage to devote about 30% of the time—at least—to the								product and then as much as possible to things like recruiting, bigger picture projects,								and one-on-ones.</p><p>  我们最终将与产品相关的商品标记为红色，将与产品相关的投资者/董事标记为蓝绿色等。我正在寻找的是平衡的一周；一个星期，理想情况下，我设法（至少）将大约30％的时间投入到产品上，然后尽可能多地投入到招聘，大型项目和一对一的工作上。</p><p>  And so, if my calendar becomes too external or too much of anything, it&#39;s the first								thing we see when we sit down for our priorities meeting. This makes scheduling a lot								easier.</p><p>  因此，如果我的日历变得过于外部或太多，那么当我们坐下来参加优先会议时，这是我们看到的第一件事。这使调度变得容易得多。 </p><p>    This is a very natural segue to my next question. One of the theories behind										this whole set of interviews is diving into the atomic bits of how we spend our										time in meetings. This time compounds over the long term and has a massive										effect. What does a good meeting with Tobi look like? Alternatively, what does a										bad meeting with you look like?</p><p>对于我的下一个问题，这是很自然的话题。整套采访背后的理论之一是深入探讨我们如何在会议中度过时光。这段时间从长远来看会变得复杂，并会产生巨大的影响。与Tobi的良好会面是什么样的？另外，与您的不好的会面是什么样的？</p><p>  So actually, agendas are not terribly successful with me. I admire how other CEOs I’ve								spoken with always have a strict agenda where everyone has a speaking slot. I find that								absolutely fascinating. Even if I really set myself to an agenda and say, “Okay, great,								this is going to happen,” I can&#39;t get through half of a meeting like this. Partly								because a good meeting is, for me personally, when I learn something.</p><p>  因此，实际上，议程对我而言并不十分成功。我佩服与之交谈的其他CEO总是有严格的议程，每个人都有发言权。我发现这绝对令人着迷。即使我真的将自己设定为议程，并说：“好吧，这将要发生。”我不能参加这样的会议的一半。一部分是因为对我而言，一次良好的聚会是我学到一些东西的时候。</p><p>  ..when I have my own ideas, the first thing I tend to do is										just try to falsify them, to figure out why what I&#39;m thinking about is probably										incorrect...</p><p>  ..当我有自己的想法时，我倾向于做的第一件事就是尝试捏造它们，弄清楚为什么我在想的东西可能是错误的...</p><p>  I started a company because I love learning. I went into programming because I found it								fascinating. During meetings, I just love to hear the things that teams have discovered.								When you&#39;re discussing an idea or a decision, I want to know what has been considered.								To be honest, I find myself more interested in the inputs of an idea than the actual								decision. I say this because when I have my own ideas, the first thing I tend to do is								just try to falsify them, to figure out why what I&#39;m thinking about is probably								incorrect. This is actually something that I have to explain to people that I work with.								If I like someone&#39;s idea, I tend to do the same thing: I try to poke holes in it.</p><p>  我开一家公司是因为我喜欢学习。我开始编程是因为我发现它很有趣。在会议期间，我只是喜欢听听团队发现的事情。当您讨论想法或决定时，我想知道已经考虑了什么。老实说，我发现自己对想法的投入比实际决定更感兴趣。我之所以这样说，是因为当我有自己的想法时，我倾向于做的第一件事就是尝试捏造它们，弄清楚为什么我在想的东西可能是错误的。实际上，这是我必须向与我合作的人解释的东西。如果我喜欢某人的想法，我倾向于做同样的事情：我试图戳破它。</p><p>  I usually say, “Well, the implication of this choice means you&#39;ve made the following								assumptions. What inputs did you use to make these foundational assumptions?”								Effectively, I&#39;m trying to figure out if an idea is built on solid fundamentals. I find								that shaky fundamentals tend to be where things often go wrong. The decision being								discussed could be the perfect decision according to the various assumptions that								everyone came into the room with. But if those assumptions are faulty, the seemingly								perfect decision is faulty too. Interestingly, assumptions are rarely mentioned in the								briefing docs or in the slide deck. Usually, I&#39;m trying to make sure those are rock								solid. Through this process, I invariably end up learning something completely new about								a field. That gives me great confidence and comfort both in the decision and the								direction.</p><p>  我通常会说：“嗯，这种选择的含义意味着您已经做出了以下假设。您使用了哪些输入来做出这些基本假设？”实际上，我正在尝试弄清某个想法是否建立在坚实的基础之上。我发现动荡的基本原理往往会导致错误。根据每个人进入会议室的各种假设，正在讨论的决策可能是完美的决策。但是，如果这些假设是错误的，那么看似完美的决定也是错误的。有趣的是，简报文档或幻灯片中很少提及假设。通常，我会尝试确保它们坚如磐石。通过这个过程，我总是会学到关于某个领域的全新知识。这使我对决策和方向都充满了信心和安慰。</p><p>     Two words have come up a lot in preparatory conversations: comprehensivist and										enneagrams. Could you talk about both?</p><p>     在准备性对话中，经常出现两个词：综合主义者和九卦。你能谈谈两者吗？</p><p>    [Laughs]								I feel like I&#39;m becoming known for pointing people towards the enneagram. I actually								don&#39;t think it&#39;s that valuable on its own. The valuable thing about any of these								personality-type constructs is that they do a really good job of teaching people that								other people are very different. That realization is probably one of the biggest growth								moments for people in general. It tells you that different people play different roles.								On that note, I do think that, ideally, people should play their own roles really,								really well.</p><p>    [笑]我觉得我是因为将人指向九字组而闻名。实际上，我认为它本身并不那么有价值。这些人格类型构造中的任何一个的价值在于，它们在教导人们他人与众不同方面做得非常好。对于一般人来说，实现这一目标可能是最大的增长时刻之一。它告诉您，不同的人扮演着不同的角色。关于这一点，我确实认为，理想情况下，人们应该真正，非常好地发挥自己的作用。 </p><p>  I play the role of challenger, personally. I find that the enneagram helps me remind								myself that with different people I have to talk about the same things in different								ways. I think it allows you to skip some time which would otherwise be touch and go at								the beginning of a relationship and helps build trust better. In short, it enables us to								have fruitful and effective conversations.								And comprehensivist, I mean, that&#39;s a fancy word.</p><p>我个人扮演挑战者的角色。我发现，九型人格有助于我提醒自己，与不同的人，我必须以不同的方式谈论同一件事。我认为，这可以让您略过一段这段时间，否则这段时间就很容易接触到彼此，并有助于建立信任。简而言之，它使我们能够进行富有成效的对话。理解主义者，我的意思是，这是个花哨的词。</p><p>  [Laughs] I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever used it outside of putting it into my Twitter								bio when I was reading Buckminster Fuller. That said, I do like range. I find that the								first 80% of every field is pretty quick to learn—it’s equivalent to the Pareto								principle—and I think that creativity generally is people using lessons from one field								in another field in different ways. Because of this, I find learning fascinating.								 ..creativity generally is people using lessons from one field										in another field in different ways...</p><p>  [笑]我在阅读巴克敏斯特·富勒（Buckminster Fuller）时，除了将其放入Twitter简历之外，还没有使用过它。就是说，我喜欢范围。我发现每个领域的前80％都非常容易学习-相当于帕累托原理-并且我认为创造力通常是人们以不同的方式利用来自另一个领域的经验教训。因此，我发现学习很有趣。 ..创造力通常是人们以不同的方式利用另一领域的经验教训...</p><p>    You try and design how your company spends time and attention. One particular										incident came up recently which I found really fascinating. You wrote a script										to delete every recurring meeting at Shopify. Talk about why you did that, and										what you ended up learning from it.</p><p>    您尝试设计公司如何花费时间和精力。最近发生了一起特别令人着迷的事件。您编写了一个脚本来删除Shopify上的每个定期会议。谈论您为什么这么做，以及您从中学到了什么。</p><p>  [Laughs]								So, going back a little bit further there—you know what, I should talk about books. One								thing that is interesting is how people have accused Shopify of being a book club thinly								veiled as a public company.</p><p>  [笑]所以，再往前走一点-你知道什么，我应该谈论书本。有趣的一件事是，人们如何指责Shopify成为一家薄薄的上市公司的读书俱乐部。</p><p>  We tend to read a lot and talk about a lot of books. We read Nassim Taleb’s books and one								person on my team began talking about Antifragile and gave an outline. He said, “I think								Nassim is putting a word to the thing that you keep talking about…”</p><p>  我们倾向于阅读很多，谈论很多书。我们读了纳西姆·塔莱布（Nassim Taleb）的书，然后我的团队中的一个人开始谈论反脆弱性，并给出了大纲。他说：“我认为纳西姆正在对您一直在谈论的事情说一句话……”</p><p>  Now, I come from an engineering perspective. One of my biggest beefs with engineers, in								general, is that they love determinism. I think there&#39;s very little determinism in								engineering left that&#39;s of value. An individual computer is deterministic; once you								introduce even just a network connection into the mix, everything becomes unpredictable								and you have to write code that&#39;s resilient to the unknown. Most interesting things come								from non-deterministic behaviors. People have a love for the predictable, but there is								value in being able to build systems that can absorb whatever is being thrown at them								and still have good outcomes.</p><p>  现在，我从工程角度出发。总的来说，我与工程师最大的合作之一就是他们喜欢确定性。我认为工程学中很少有确定性的东西可以留下价值。单个计算机是确定性的；一旦您将甚至只是网络连接引入到组合中，一切都将变得不可预测，并且您必须编写可适应未知情况的代码。最有趣的事情来自非确定性行为。人们热爱可预测的事物，但能够构建能够吸收所遭受的一切并仍然具有良好结果的系统具有价值。</p><p>  So, I love Antifragile, and I make everyone read it. It finally put a name to an								important concept that we practiced. Before this, I would just log in and shut down								various servers to teach the team what’s now called chaos engineering.</p><p>  因此，我喜欢抗脆弱性，并且让所有人都阅读它。最后，它为我们实践的重要概念起了个名字。在此之前，我只需登录并关闭各种服务器，以向团队介绍现在称为“混沌工程”的东西。 </p><p>  But we&#39;ve done this for a long, long time. We&#39;ve designed Shopify very well because								resilience and uptime are so important for building trust. These lessons were there in								the building of our architecture. And then I had to take over as CEO.</p><p>但是，我们已经做了很长时间了。我们对Shopify的设计非常好，因为弹性和正常运行时间对于建立信任至关重要。这些教训都存在于我们的建筑中。然后我必须接任首席执行官。</p><p>  When that happened, I made two decisions: one, I&#39;m going to try to learn as much about								business as possible. But, if business is very different from software architecture, I&#39;m								going to be no good no matter what I do. And so, I ran an experiment to treat								engineering principles, software architecture, complex system design, and company								building as the same thing. Effectively, we looked for the business equivalent of just								turning off servers to see if the system has resiliency. For instance, we used to ask								people to use their mouse on their non-dominant hand for a day. We introduced these								little nudges to ensure that people didn’t become complacent.								 ..I ran an experiment to treat										engineering principles, software architecture, complex system design, and company										building as the same thing...</p><p>  发生这种情况时，我做出了两个决定：一个，我将尝试尽可能多地了解业务。但是，如果业务与软件体系结构有很大不同，那么无论我做什么，我都不会是好事。因此，我进行了一个实验，将工程原理，软件体系结构，复杂的系统设计和公司建设视为同一事物。实际上，我们寻找的业务等同于仅关闭服务器以查看系统是否具有弹性。例如，我们过去经常要求人们在非惯用手上使用鼠标一天。我们引入了这些小技巧来确保人们不会变得自满。 ..我进行了一项实验，将工程原理，软件体系结构，复杂的系统设计和公司建设视为同一件事。</p><p>    There are a bunch of really fun stories around this. I had a conversation with one of my								co-founders, and we were discussing our unique problem: namely, Shopify was a company								initially for American customers, built by German founders, in Canada.</p><p>    周围有很多非常有趣的故事。我与一位联合创始人进行了交谈，我们正在讨论我们的独特问题：即Shopify最初是一家为美国客户服务的公司，由德国创始人在加拿大建立。</p><p>      For instance, we talk a lot about how different cultures interact because we couldn&#39;t								have built Shopify without the Canadian optimism. These things were not necessarily								things that we would recognize, at least when it comes to optimism, coming from Germany.								That said, there are also challenges between cultures. For instance, Canadians are								unbelievably nice. Like, no one wants to ever say anything to upset anyone. This is why								we need to emphasize the importance of feedback. In this way, the uphill battle is more								real for us than it would be for a Silicon Valley company.</p><p>      例如，我们谈论了很多不同的文化如何相互作用，因为如果没有加拿大的乐观主义，就不可能建立Shopify。这些事情不一定是我们会认识到的，至少在乐观方面，来自德国。也就是说，文化之间也存在挑战。例如，加拿大人真好。就像，没有人想说什么让任何人不高兴。这就是为什么我们需要强调反馈的重要性。这样，与硅谷公司相比，对我们来说，艰苦的战斗更加真实。</p><p>  There&#39;s so much on the theme of how Shopify is not a Silicon Valley company. I										think you pointed out one of these themes right here.</p><p>  关于Shopify如何不是硅谷公司的主题有很多。我认为您在这里指出了这些主题之一。</p><p>    For instance, if we had built the company in Israel, this would not have been a								challenge. It&#39;s really important to understand that culture is real and multi-layered.								The “host” city’s effect on the employees in that local office is very real. To do								something world class, you have to show up with a lot of world class skills, and not a								lot of downsides.</p><p>    例如，如果我们在以色列建立了公司，这将不是挑战。了解文化是真实的和多层的，这一点非常重要。 “所在”城市对当地办事处员工的影响是非常真实的。要做世界一流的事情，您必须展现出许多世界一流的技能，而没有很多缺点。</p><p>      That was a tangent, but to get back to the question you asked, we found that standing								meetings were a real issue. They were extremely easy to create, and no one wanted to								cancel them because someone was responsible for its creation. The person requesting to								cancel would rather stick it out than have a very tough conversation saying, “Hey, this								thing that you started is no longer valuable.” It’s just really difficult.								So, we ran some analysis and we found out that half of all standing meetings were viewed								as not valuable. It was an enormous amount of time being wasted. So we asked, “Why don&#39;t								we just delete all meetings?” And so we did. It was pretty rough, but we now operate on								a schedule.</p><p>      那是切线，但是回到您提出的问题，我们发现常务会议是一个真正的问题。它们非常易于创建，没有人想要取消它们，因为有人对其创建负责。请求取消的人宁愿坚持下去，也不愿进行激烈的交谈，“嘿，您开始做的这件事不再有价值。”这真的很困难。因此，我们进行了一些分析，发现所有常务会议中有一半被认为没有价值。这是浪费大量时间。因此，我们问：“为什么不删除所有会议？”因此，我们做到了。这很粗糙，但是我们现在按计划进行。 </p><p>  I love that. I think it gives people permission to change things up radically.										Another example of this was when you asked the entire company to work from home,										or work without office space, for a month before the pandemic. Given COVID, this										seems incredibly prescient. Could you talk about that?</p><p>我喜欢那个。我认为它允许人们从根本上改变现状。另一个例子是，当您要求整个公司在大流行发生前一个月在家工作或没有办公室的情况下工作。给定COVID，这似乎是不可思议的先见之明。你能谈谈吗？</p><p>    [Laughs]								Yeah, it makes us look better than I think we are, but we didn&#39;t have that in a crystal								ball.</p><p>    [笑]是的，它使我们看起来比我想象的要好，但我们并没有在水晶球中看到它。</p><p>  You should just take credit for it. Say, “You know, I predicted this.”										[Laughs]</p><p>  您应该为此功劳。说，“您知道，我预言了这一点。” [笑]</p><p>  What actually happened is that we were going to move to a new office, and it was a bit								delayed. Because of this, the time overlap between the leases got really tight. So, we								ended up having a meeting, which was called Plan B. In it, my CFO said, “The current								lender doesn&#39;t want to extend because he&#39;s so angry at us leaving. We need to have a								Plan B just in case we&#39;re running out of the lease, and we can&#39;t get a new one.”</p><p>  实际发生的事情是我们要搬到新办公室，但延误了一点。因此，租约之间的时间重叠非常紧密。因此，我们最终召开了一次会议，称为“计划B”。在会议上，我的首席财务官说：“现任贷款人不愿延长贷款，因为他对我们离开感到非常愤怒。我们需要制定一份B计划，以防万一我们的租约用光了，而我们又无法获得新的。”</p><p>  In this meeting, we were discussing how we could deal with this. We decided that we								would all work remotely for a month. At the end of the day, the timelines ended up								aligning and we didn’t need a Plan B, but we decided to just do Plan B anyway. And that								was that.</p><p>  在这次会议上，我们正在讨论如何解决这个问题。我们决定将所有远程工作一个月。归根结底，时间表最终一致了，我们不需要计划B，但是我们还是决定只执行计划B。就是这样。</p><p>  So we sent an email saying, “Hey, next week, your desk phones won&#39;t work anymore. We&#39;re								going to work together remotely, partly because we have some remote members and need to								build empathy for them. And, partly because I&#39;m sure we will learn a couple of important								lessons from the experience.”</p><p>  因此，我们发送了一封电子邮件，说：“嘿，下周，您的台式电话将不再工作。我们将进行远程合作，部分原因是我们有一些远程成员，需要为他们建立同情心。而且，部分是因为我确信我们将从经验中学到一些重要的经验教训。”</p><p>  I mean, it was probably a day or two of chaos. But it was awesome because this was								shortly after we hired some people to look after lunches for everyone—our culinary team.								They suddenly had no one to feed in the office. They ended up asking if they could have								$5,000 to buy an old food truck and just drive around town with food packages. And								what’s neat is that even though we no longer need a culinary team since we’re fully								remote, that team has all gone on to amazing careers in completely different								fields—oftentimes within Shopify—because those are the kind of people you can build								world class companies with.</p><p>  我的意思是，可能是一两天的混乱。但这太棒了，因为这是在我们雇用了一些人为我们的烹饪团队的所有人提供午餐后不久。他们突然没人来办公室。他们最终问他们是否可以有5,000美元购买一辆旧的食品卡车，然后带着食品包装在镇上开车。整洁的是，即使由于完全遥远而不再需要烹饪团队，但该团队已经在完全不同的领域（通常在Shopify内）从事了出色的职业，因为这是您可以建立世界的那种人类公司。 </p><p>  Every time we change something and make something kind of crazy, like turning Plan B into								the new Plan A, some people are just going to be amazing in those times, and those are								the people that we love betting on.</p><p>每次我们改变某些东西并使之疯狂时，例如将Plan B变成新的Plan A，在那个时候，有些人会变得很棒，而那些是我们所爱的人。</p><p>    That is a theme: your being antifragile. It sets you up for crazy events, like a										yearlong plus pandemic. Because there’s a direct parallel between what you folks										did and what&#39;s happening now.</p><p>    那是一个主题：您要抗衰。它使您为疯狂的事件做好准备，例如长达一年的大流行。因为你们的所作所为与现在发生的事情之间有着直接的相似之处。</p><p>  Shifting gears a little bit. The other theme that comes up a lot with you is										learning. I think there are a few threads here. One is your thought that										learning a craft or skill is often a great way to become better at a different										task, your regular job at Shopify, or at any business. The second is that you										personally have a long list of things that you&#39;ve learned: playing the guitar,										kite surfing...</p><p>  换档一点。与您相关的另一个主题是学习。我认为这里有一些线程。一个是您认为学习手艺或技能通常是一种更好的方法，可以使您更好地完成其他任务，在Shopify或任何行业的常规工作。第二个是您个人已经学到了很多东西：弹吉他，冲浪风筝...</p><p>  Could you talk about your philosophy around learning, how you approach it										personally, and how you think other people should?</p><p>  您能否谈谈您关于学习的哲学，您如何亲自对待它以及您如何看待他人？</p><p>  I have a complex set of thoughts on this. It is really my core value. I believe that the								job we all have in life is to acquire knowledge and wisdom and then share it. I just								don’t know what else there is. This is the bedrock of my belief system.</p><p>  我对此有一系列复杂的想法。这真的是我的核心价值。我相信我们所有人一生要做的工作就是获取知识和智慧，然后分享。我只是不知道还有什么。这是我信仰体系的基石。</p><p>  When I get close to any field, I think about how far I want to go. I&#39;m probably further								along with programming. I don’t know if I want to get from 90 to 91% in programming								when, with the same amount of work, I could figure out the first 60 to 70% of UX or even								something like drawing. There’s a recent book about this called Range, which I really								like. The book pushes in this direction and explores this topic a bit more than I do.								But I just found myself nodding throughout reading it, because it turns out that very								often—really, every field has fundamental wisdom that you discover when you&#39;re learning								and talking to the people who have mastered it. I find that going wide and learning the								best lessons from the people who have dedicated their entire lives to a certain pursuit								gets you really, really close to mastery.</p><p>  当我接近任何领域时，我都会考虑要走多远。我可能会与编程一起走得更远。我不知道我是否想在编程时从90％提高到91％，我可以用相同的工作量找出UX的前60％到70％甚至是绘图之类的东西。我最近很喜欢一本关于Range的书。这本书朝着这个方向努力，并比我更深入地探讨了这个主题。但是我发现自己在阅读过程中一直在点头，因为事实证明，经常-每个领域都有基本的智慧，您在学习和与掌握它的人交谈时会发现它们。我发现，不断进取并向一生奉献于某种追求的人们学习最好的课程，可以使您真正，非常接近精通。</p><p>    To give a more tangible example, I picked up guitar because someone asked me in an								interview if I had any regrets from childhood.</p><p>    举一个更具体的例子，我拿起吉他，是因为有人在一次采访中问我是否对童年有任何遗憾。 </p><p>    I blurted out, “Yeah, I wish I would’ve learned an instrument,” just as a sort of								noncommittal answer. And then right after, I was sitting down and thinking, “Hey, I								can&#39;t outsource the blame of not learning an instrument to my thirteen-year-old self. My								thirteen-year-old self was busy with whatever my thirteen-year-old self prioritized.” I								need to own that I didn&#39;t practice or learn an instrument. If I actually want to learn								an instrument, I can&#39;t complain about this. I need to just go and learn an instrument.</p><p>我脱口而出：“是的，我希望我会学到一种乐器。”然后紧接着，我坐下来思考：“嘿，我不能把没有学习乐器的责任外包给我十三岁的自己。我十三岁的自己忙于我十三岁的自己的优先事项。”我需要证明自己没有练习或学习乐器。如果我真的想学习一种乐器，那我就不会抱怨。我只需要去学习一种乐器。</p><p>  So I got a guitar, and I had a goal to learn to play it. For instance, I really like								blues music, and I wanted to get to the point where I could do some improvisation. I								have befriended a bunch of musicians along the way, and I have learned so many amazing								lessons from them. For example, one’s a jazz musician, and figuring out how jazz music								works has probably been the single best lesson I’ve ever come across for how to make								world class teams.</p><p>  所以我有了吉他，我的目标是学习弹吉他。例如，我真的很喜欢布鲁斯音乐，我想做些即兴演奏。我一路上结识了很多音乐家，并且从中学到了很多很棒的课程。例如，一个爵士乐手，弄清楚爵士乐的工作原理可能是我所学过的关于如何组建世界一流团队的最好的一课。</p><p>  I found jazz hard to penetrate initially. I&#39;ve grown to like it now because I have an								appreciation for how certain parts of jazz work. Really there’s a very, very fine set of								rules.</p><p>  一开始我发现爵士乐很难渗透。我之所以喜欢它，是因为我对爵士乐的某些部分的工作方式表示赞赏。确实有一套非常非常好的规则。</p><p>  Basically, people show up with a mastery of certain instruments. Someone ends up being								the jazz director and the rest of the band follows. What I love so much about this is								that it’s such a great analogy for how someone has a vision for a piece of music that								didn&#39;t exist before. It&#39;s not that there&#39;s full agreement or operational perfection.								It’s not that everything is spelled out and there’s a song sheet and everyone</p><p>  基本上，人们会熟练掌握某些乐器。最终有人成为了爵士乐导演，乐队的其他成员紧随其后。我对此非常喜欢，因为它非常类似于一个人对某首音乐的异象。这并不是说有完全的协议或操作上的完美。不是说所有的东西都拼写出来，而是有一首歌单，每个人</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theobservereffect.org/tobi.html">https://www.theobservereffect.org/tobi.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/首席/">#首席</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/working/">#working</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/学习/">#学习</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
